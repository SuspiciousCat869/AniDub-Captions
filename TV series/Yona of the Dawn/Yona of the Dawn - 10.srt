1
00:00:08,833 --> 00:00:10,125
[YUN]
Lemme out!

2
00:00:10,208 --> 00:00:12,541
You can't keep me tied
up in here forever!

3
00:00:12,625 --> 00:00:14,708
I may be cute, but that
doesn't mean you get to keep me

4
00:00:14,791 --> 00:00:16,875
in a cage like your little pet.

5
00:00:16,958 --> 00:00:18,500
I've got some powerful friends.

6
00:00:18,583 --> 00:00:21,083
And they're gonna be
super mad about this.

7
00:00:21,166 --> 00:00:23,958
Lemme out now and you
can save your village.

8
00:00:24,041 --> 00:00:26,875
Our Dragon Warrior will
protect us from any outsiders.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,125
[YUN]
So this is the clan

10
00:00:29,208 --> 00:00:31,583
who protects the Dragon
Warrior's bloodline.

11
00:00:31,666 --> 00:00:33,958
How am I gonna get
out of this mess?

12
00:00:34,041 --> 00:00:36,000
Maybe Hak and the princess
are gonna storm the place

13
00:00:36,083 --> 00:00:37,250
and save me.

14
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:38,958
And, to your left,

15
00:00:39,041 --> 00:00:41,875
you'll see a lovely view of
the White Dragon's home.

16
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:43,416
What the hell?

17
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,541
Why are the two of you getting
treated like tourists, huh?

18
00:00:47,166 --> 00:00:48,291
Oh, hi, Yun. What's up?

19
00:00:48,375 --> 00:00:50,208
What's up is my blood pressure!

20
00:00:50,291 --> 00:00:53,041
[OLD MAN] I apologize for
the way we treated him.

21
00:00:53,125 --> 00:00:55,750
You, get that boy out
of his restraints.

22
00:00:55,833 --> 00:00:57,208
[MAN A]
But, sir...

23
00:00:57,291 --> 00:00:59,750
We have a crimson-haired
guest with us.

24
00:00:59,833 --> 00:01:02,250
Oh, my! Right away, sir!

25
00:01:05,041 --> 00:01:06,291
What's going on?

26
00:01:06,375 --> 00:01:09,166
I'm not sure. As soon
as they saw the princess,

27
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:11,166
everyone kinda backed off us.

28
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:14,958
It's weird. They're all obsessed
with her hair. But why?

29
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:54,833
[OLD MAN] Please forgive us
for acting so rudely earlier.

30
00:02:55,916 --> 00:02:57,833
This village is where
the White Dragon,

31
00:02:57,916 --> 00:02:59,750
one of the four
dragons of legend,

32
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:04,166
retired once his role in the
Mythical Era war was completed.

33
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,875
We've had to fight off many
power-hungry adventurers

34
00:03:06,958 --> 00:03:08,083
who've shown up over the years

35
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:11,291
looking to obtain the
might of the dragon.

36
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:14,250
It's our joy to protect
the White Dragon Warrior,

37
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:17,958
and to ensure that his bloodline
is passed on to new generations.

38
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:23,000
This has understandably made
us wary of most outsiders.

39
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:26,833
[HAK] I understand
your predicament, but--

40
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:28,625
Is this ordinary?

41
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,291
--[WOMAN A] So pretty!
--[WOMAN B] Crimson hair!

42
00:03:30,375 --> 00:03:33,375
[WOMAN C]
Wow! It's so beautiful!

43
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:36,083
[gasps] Hak, that woman just
called my hair beautiful!

44
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:37,875
I heard her.

45
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:40,916
Her hair color is pretty rare.
But is that really any reason

46
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,083
for everyone to
freak out like this?

47
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:46,291
Given our history, crimson hair
holds a very special meaning

48
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:47,916
for the people of this village.

49
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,333
The first White Dragon
Warrior served a master

50
00:03:50,416 --> 00:03:52,791
who had hair that
burned like fire.

51
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:55,166
It's funny.

52
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:57,625
I always wished it
was a different color.

53
00:03:57,708 --> 00:03:59,625
[OLD MAN] You should
feel honored to have it.

54
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:02,041
When we found you, you mentioned
that it was an oracle

55
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:04,958
who guided you to
this secluded village.

56
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:06,833
You could be the one.

57
00:04:06,916 --> 00:04:08,291
The ancient king's heir who

58
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:11,291
we've been hoping would
arrive for thousands of years.

59
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,916
[OLD MAN]
Then again, maybe not.

60
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,208
[YUN, YONA, HAK groan]

61
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:19,666
So, now that we know
where the village is,

62
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,083
what happens if
she's not the one?

63
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:27,750
[OLD MAN] Anyway, the birdsong
is lovely this time of year.

64
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:30,375
[YUN] You can't just
avoid the question!

65
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:32,541
Hey, you're gonna keep me
safe, too, aren't you?

66
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:34,958
You know, if anything
strange starts to go down?

67
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:37,041
Dunno. I'll think about it.

68
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:38,416
If you don't mind my asking,

69
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,875
what makes your White
Dragon Warrior so special?

70
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:42,666
I mean, from the looks
of it, your entire clan

71
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:45,333
is direct descendants
of the original one.

72
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:47,458
Yes, that's true.

73
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:49,833
We may all be descended
of the same bloodline,

74
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:51,500
but only one person a generation

75
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,875
possesses the White
Dragon's power.

76
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:56,541
[OLD MAN]
That person is born

77
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:59,375
with the dragon's might
sealed in his right hand.

78
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,000
[WHITE DRAGON]
I wonder...

79
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:04,250
Why do mornings always
make my hand ache?

80
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:08,541
We have an emergency! The White
Dragon is in terrible pain!

81
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:09,875
[WHITE DRAGON]
I'm fine!

82
00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:11,625
There's no reason to make
a big deal out of this!

83
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:13,000
[sighs]

84
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:14,791
Y'know, you're going to stop
this old woman's heart

85
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:16,291
one of these days.

86
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:19,500
I was afraid that you'd somehow
injured your sacred hand.

87
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:22,708
[WHITE DRAGON] You're always
overreacting to everything.

88
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:25,541
Besides, I'm not even sure
how I could hurt myself.

89
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:28,958
I live hidden away under the
entire village's protection.

90
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:30,333
It's backwards.

91
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:33,041
Shouldn't I be the one who
protects everyone else?

92
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:34,791
What would we do if you did?

93
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:38,291
Watching over you gives us
purpose and a sense of duty.

94
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:39,541
You were blessed with a strength

95
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:42,250
that can't be squandered
on day-to-day affairs.

96
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:44,250
And you're not only powerful,
you're more beautiful

97
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:45,958
than all the other
White Dragon Warriors

98
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:47,625
I've raised
over the years.

99
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:49,000
[WHITE DRAGON sighs]

100
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:52,208
[WHITE DRAGON] That's great.
But it's so frustrating.

101
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:53,708
I have such might,

102
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:56,708
but, when will I be able to
use it to make a difference?

103
00:05:56,791 --> 00:06:00,416
When the time comes to use your
power, you will recognize it.

104
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,708
If your mother and
father were still alive,

105
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:04,916
they'd remind you
to have patience.

106
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,708
The power may not even
be needed in your lifetime.

107
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:09,083
If that's the case,

108
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:11,625
you should consider yourself
lucky to live in peace.

109
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:14,291
You can rest easy knowing
that the next White Dragon,

110
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:17,958
or the one after him, or one
later still, will use the power

111
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:22,500
to protect his master on your
behalf as you watch from beyond.

112
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:24,625
[WHITE DRAGON]
The next White Dragon.

113
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:27,166
[GRANNY] All you need to do
is rest easy in the village

114
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:30,125
and try not to worry
yourself too much.

115
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:31,333
[WHITE DRAGON]
When will this master,

116
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:34,041
who I'm supposed to
protect, finally appear?

117
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:37,791
[WHITE DRAGON]
I want to meet him soon.

118
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:40,291
I want to have a
purpose in this life.

119
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:43,541
[GRANNY]
By the way, White Dragon.

120
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:48,583
Ahhh. Unless I've miscounted,

121
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:51,250
you've reached the ripe
old age of 20 this year.

122
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:52,416
[WHITE DRAGON]
Yes, that's right.

123
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,791
Well, then, you're
around the age

124
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:56,083
where you should've chosen
a wife or two already,

125
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:57,125
wouldn't you say?

126
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:58,833
[WHITE DRAGON]
One! One is plenty.

127
00:06:58,916 --> 00:07:00,958
If that's true,
then pick one already!

128
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:02,916
Soon there won't be any
more women in the village

129
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,750
who meet your lofty standards!

130
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:08,125
[WHITE DRAGON] Please, hurry,
master. I'm ready to serve you.

131
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:10,750
[VILLAGERS chatter]

132
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:12,375
[WHITE DRAGON] What's with all
the commotion this morning?

133
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:13,708
[GRANNY]
That?

134
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:15,750
Some outsiders wandered
into the village earlier.

135
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:18,250
What? We should
eliminate them quickly.

136
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:19,958
[GRANNY] Actually, I hear
there's something special

137
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:21,750
about them.
Apparently, the villagers

138
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:23,291
--have really taken to them.
--[WHITE DRAGON growls]

139
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:25,458
This place is supposed
to be a secret!

140
00:07:25,541 --> 00:07:28,166
I hear there's a really
pretty young lady with them.

141
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,750
[WHITE DRAGON]
Of course there is.

142
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:33,708
There's no one trickier or more
deadly than a female assassin.

143
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:34,750
I'll take care of her.

144
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:36,458
White Dragon, wait!

145
00:07:36,541 --> 00:07:38,916
[WHITE DRAGON] I may not be
allowed to leave this village,

146
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,541
but I can use my
power to protect it.

147
00:07:44,708 --> 00:07:45,958
[YONA sighs]

148
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:48,000
Hey, what's with the long face?

149
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:50,166
This kinda seems wrong.

150
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,250
The villagers said when
a child with the power

151
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:54,500
of the White Dragon
Warrior is born here,

152
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:56,375
then the previous
White Dragon Warrior

153
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:59,333
loses his power soon afterwards.

154
00:07:59,416 --> 00:08:02,375
They've been protecting this
bloodline all these years,

155
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:04,000
waiting for the day
when the dragon's might

156
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:07,541
will be called upon once
again to save the world.

157
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:08,791
But I'm asking them to give me

158
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:11,416
their greatest treasure
for something personal.

159
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:14,000
Are you giving up?

160
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,541
[chuckles]

161
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:21,958
Hey, Hak. Let me borrow this.

162
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:25,125
I won't give up.
The dragon's coming with us.

163
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:27,458
Besides, we've come
all this way.

164
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:29,583
We can't just turn back now.

165
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:33,958
[WHITE DRAGON]
No need to be alarmed.

166
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:35,541
There they are.

167
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:39,625
The scoundrels. How dare they
send this village into a panic?

168
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:42,666
My claws will make
short work of them.

169
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:43,916
Give yourselves up!

170
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,500
[YONA, HAK gasp]

171
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:45,541
[YUN]
Huh?

172
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:54,291
[WHITE DRAGON]
She has... crimson hair!

173
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:55,458
[heartbeat]

174
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:56,625
[BOTH gasp]

175
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:58,333
[WHITE DRAGON]
What's happening? My hand!

176
00:08:58,416 --> 00:09:02,166
It feels like my blood
is flowing backwards.

177
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:05,791
[DRAGON] From this day forward,
you shall act as our avatars.

178
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:07,291
We have granted you our power

179
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:10,041
so that you may protect
the Crimson Dragon.

180
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:13,500
It is your duty to defend
him with your lives.

181
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:19,208
[screaming]

182
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:21,500
[WHITE DRAGON]
Is it possible?

183
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:24,666
Could this young
girl be my master?

184
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:27,208
Is she the one I've yearned for?

185
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:27,875
[WHITE DRAGON groans]

186
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:31,041
[VILLAGERS chatter]

187
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:35,916
[GIJA'S FATHER] Gija, the
first White Dragon Warrior

188
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,250
was born in the Mythical Era to
protect the Crimson Dragon King.

189
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:42,875
One day the king will rise
again, and when he does,

190
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:45,333
it is your duty to protect
him with your life.

191
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:47,875
But father, when will he come?

192
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:50,125
When will I be able
to use my power?

193
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:52,000
You'll know when you see him.

194
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:55,125
Your blood will cry out,
recognizing its master.

195
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:57,833
For it is the blood
of the White Dragon.

196
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:01,791
[GIJA'S FATHER] A blinding light
will flash before your eyes.

197
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:05,583
That will be your signal, and
the beginning of your journey.

198
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:07,791
[VILLAGERS chatter]

199
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:09,791
[groaning]

200
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:12,000
You gonna be okay?

201
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:13,875
[OLD MAN]
Look! His hand!

202
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:16,041
I've never seen
anything like this!

203
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:22,750
[WHITE DRAGON]
Dear father,

204
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:25,750
and all of the White Dragons
who came before me,

205
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:29,708
the men who protected
this clan and bloodline,

206
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:32,333
thank you.

207
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:35,958
So, then, are you
the White Dragon?

208
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:39,708
I am. The Dragon's blood
flows through my veins.

209
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:42,166
It cried out when
I first saw you.

210
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:47,166
[WHITE DRAGON] I've been
waiting for you. My master.

211
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:50,958
Your master? What are
you talking about?

212
00:10:58,333 --> 00:11:00,458
What an amazing day this
is for you, White Dragon.

213
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:02,500
Our king has finally appeared
after all this time

214
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:04,166
and he's a little girl!

215
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:05,583
[YONA] King?

216
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:07,625
Why do they keep referring
to the princess as a guy?

217
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,166
It's because of the legend.

218
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:12,166
The king had crimson
hair, like she does.

219
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:13,250
[WHITE DRAGON]
My ancient master.

220
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:14,416
[YONA gasps]

221
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,041
[WHITE DRAGON]
Please, tell me your name.

222
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:19,666
It's Yona.

223
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:22,166
Master... Yona.

224
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:25,750
[YONA] So he's the
White Dragon Warrior.

225
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:28,750
With his smooth white skin
and shimmering silver hair,

226
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:31,583
it's easy to tell he's
not a normal person.

227
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:34,416
You're a very pretty boy.

228
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,250
Uh. You are mistaken!

229
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:38,916
It is you, Master,
who is truly beautiful.

230
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
[YONA]
Such flattery!

231
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:42,500
I'm sorry to disappoint you,

232
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:45,625
but I'm neither your
king nor your master.

233
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:48,791
You see, I'm actually
just a fugitive.

234
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:51,916
I want your power to
protect me and my friends.

235
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,708
Y'know, you could've phrased
that in a much better way.

236
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:59,083
I'm on a journey to reunite the
four Dragon Warriors of legend.

237
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:03,500
I've come to ask you for your
help first. Will you join me?

238
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:08,875
I would be extremely honored.

239
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:11,416
No matter who you are
or what purpose you have,

240
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,875
I'm your Dragon
Warrior from now on.

241
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:15,875
I'll serve you in any way I can.

242
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:20,083
For my blood compels me to.
I am now your humble servant.

243
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:24,458
That settles it. I'll be
leaving the village at once.

244
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:26,291
Our master commands it.

245
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:27,291
[OLD MAN] Right!

246
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:28,875
What is this nonsense,
young man?

247
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:29,750
[OLD MAN screams]

248
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:31,333
This calls for a celebration!

249
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:34,041
Prepare a feast in honor of the
Crimson Dragon King's return!

250
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:35,541
Immediately.

251
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:42,583
We've waited a long time.
Seeing you is a gift.

252
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:44,333
I'm so grateful
I lived long enough

253
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:46,125
to see your crimson hair shine.

254
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:49,125
And those adorable
but fiercely smart eyes.

255
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:51,250
And your blushing skin that--

256
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:52,666
[YONA squeaks]

257
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,541
Doesn't really look like
it's been taken good care of.

258
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:56,000
[YONA, WHITE DRAGON sigh]

259
00:12:58,625 --> 00:13:00,416
[YUN]
Man, this is kind of strange.

260
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:03,083
Ik-su was right
about this location.

261
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:05,083
But I figured it would take
a little more convincing

262
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:06,708
to get him to join us.

263
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:08,250
I wonder if he's disappointed

264
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:11,291
that I'm a princess
instead of his king.

265
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:13,625
Or, if he's surprised
you're a fugitive.

266
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:15,666
That's the truth, though.

267
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,666
I didn't want to lie to anyone.

268
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,208
Why do you have that weird grin

269
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:21,666
on your face, Lightning Beast?
It's kinda freaking me out.

270
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,958
I was just thinking.
It was kinda fun

271
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:27,166
watching the princess act
like a total badass earlier.

272
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:29,000
Are you making fun of me, Hak?

273
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:30,500
You'll never know!

274
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:38,208
[WHITE DRAGON] My right arm's
tingling. My body's still hot.

275
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:41,791
As soon as I saw her,
my blood began to burn.

276
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:43,791
And I could hear the voice
of the ancient dragon

277
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:46,333
speak directly to my soul.

278
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:49,416
[WHITE DRAGON] After thousands
of years of waiting,

279
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,375
the day our clan has
longed for is here.

280
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:55,250
I've known my purpose in this
world since I was a child,

281
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:57,916
and my time is now is at hand.

282
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,833
Mother and Father,
please, watch over me.

283
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:05,208
[knocking]

284
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:08,208
'Scuse me.

285
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:10,125
[WHITE DRAGON]
Huh? What rudeness!

286
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:13,583
You can't just barge inside
my castle without permission.

287
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:15,291
[HAK]
Oh, yeah, sorry 'bout that.

288
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:17,208
What are you doing here?

289
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:19,291
[HAK] I came to see if
you had any useful stuff

290
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:22,750
that could help us out.
But you don't.

291
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:24,583
[growling]

292
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:25,833
[WHITE DRAGON]
Take this.

293
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:29,500
[HAK] Whoa. Wow, you're really
generous, White Dragon.

294
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:32,208
You may consider this
money a parting gift.

295
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:33,583
[HAK] Wha--?

296
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:36,333
Thank you for your service,
but now you're relieved.

297
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:40,333
I will be protecting the
princess now. So, you can go.

298
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:44,333
Oh, the other two are back.

299
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:50,208
[YUN] Umm... Why do I feel like
something terrible has happened?

300
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:51,750
[YONA]
What's going on?

301
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:54,708
Princess, let's find another
White Dragon. This one's dumb.

302
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:55,916
[WHITE DRAGON]
How do you not realize

303
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,625
you are no longer
wanted or needed?

304
00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:00,291
There's no way a
pampered jerk like you

305
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:02,625
is taking my job,
show some respect.

306
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:04,250
It's destiny!

307
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:07,041
Why have you employed such an
idiotic worm as your bodyguard?

308
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:09,166
How are you already fighting?

309
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:10,583
He wants to fire me.

310
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:13,333
He even tried to bribe me
to convince me to leave.

311
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:15,625
Well, that would

It's my sacred duty to
serve and protect her.

If you're not a

No way!

316
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:25,750
Hak's been my friend
since childhood.

317
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:27,625
Even after I was chased
from the castle

318
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:31,041
and everyone turned
against me, he kept me going.

He's important to me.

I command that he
stay by my side!

[HAK chuckling]

322
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:46,041
Well, well. Y'hear
that, White Dragon?

323
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:50,166
I'm important. I guess
you're stuck with me.

324
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,000
We're giving this back.

325

If that's how you
really feel, Princess.

326
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:58,083
Don't look so sad.
I need you, too.

327
00:15:58,166 --> 00:15:59,500
At the rate we've been going,

328
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:02,250
Hak is going to die trying
to protect me on his own.

329
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:03,875
So, I want you
to look after Hak

330
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:07,041
and make sure that he doesn't
end up getting himself killed.

331

Ohhhh!

332
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:12,416
This all suddenly
makes perfect sense.

333
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,625
You need me to protect him

334
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:15,833
because he can't
take care of himself.

335
00:16:15,916 --> 00:16:18,041
Count on me.
I'll keep you safe,

336
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:21,250
but also watch out for
this vulnerable beast.

You may think you're
tough, but I don't need

some dainty "white snake"
watching over me, got it?

White Snake, huh?

You dare call a sacred
Dragon Warrior such a name?

Over the years, I've

of White Dragon Warriors
in this village.

346

And now, the moment I've spent

an entire lifetime dreaming
about has finally arrived.

[VILLAGER A]
Goodbye, White Dragon.

352

Everyone, I told you that
you didn't have to come

353
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:22,875
and see me off.

354

[VILLAGER B] I can't
believe you're going already.

[VILLAGER C] We thought
we'd have more time

356
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:27,750
to say our farewells.

357
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:29,166
I can't linger.

The master I'm destined
to serve has come for me.

I'm taking my rightful
place by her side.

360

She needs my strength,
the same power you protected,

361
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:41,208
and that the previous White
Dragon Warriors passed on to me.

You're so noble!

Please, come back
as soon as possible.

Good. I'm counting on you.

the bloodline will be protected
