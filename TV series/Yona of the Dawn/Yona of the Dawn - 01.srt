1
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:26,875
[HAK]
Princess Yona.

2
00:00:26,958 --> 00:00:28,458
We should really get going.

3
00:00:34,291 --> 00:00:36,583
It's cold here. Isn't it?

4
00:00:36,666 --> 00:00:39,291
We are on the
edge of the mountains.

5
00:00:39,375 --> 00:00:40,958
[YONA]
In my time at the castle,

6
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,833
I never knew the cold
beyond its walls.

7
00:00:43,916 --> 00:00:46,000
That life is gone now.

8
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,666
[YONA] I was born
in the Kohka Kingdom.

9
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:23,041
The Crimson Dragon
castle was my home.

10
00:02:23,125 --> 00:02:26,166
My father, King Il,
had produced no male heir,

11
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,166
and had no queen
to bear him a prince

12
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:29,708
to ascend to the throne.

13
00:02:29,791 --> 00:02:32,125
Our family consisted
of the king and me,

14
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:35,291
his only beloved,
fifteen-year-old daughter.

15
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:37,083
[IL] This year marks
the tenth anniversary

16
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:39,916
of the death of my father,
the great King Junam.

17
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,416
Our cherished land of Kohka

18
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,000
is a small kingdom
with powerful neighbors.

19
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:45,708
We have been plunged
into wars with them

20
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:47,500
countless times in the past.

21
00:02:47,583 --> 00:02:48,750
Where's the princess?

22
00:02:48,833 --> 00:02:50,125
I believe she's
still in her chambers,

23
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:51,291
prepping for the event, sir.

24
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:52,416
Oh, that's right.

25
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,291
Must be 'cause
he's coming today.

26
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:55,416
Huh?

27
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,875
What a child.

28
00:02:56,958 --> 00:02:59,208
[IL] My daughter, Yona,
will soon turn sixteen.

29
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:00,458
For her sake and yours,

30
00:03:00,541 --> 00:03:03,458
I pray that my ancestor,
the Crimson Dragon King,

31
00:03:03,541 --> 00:03:05,291
will continue
to shower blessings

32
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:07,291
upon our beloved
nation forever!

33
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:08,708
[CROWD cheering]

34
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:10,875
[CROWD]
Long live King Il!

35
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:13,291
Long live King Il!

36
00:03:14,958 --> 00:03:17,291
You look absolutely
stunning, Princess.

37
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:19,750
Please, forgive my rushing you,
but we should be there already.

38
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:21,583
Not yet!
This isn't right.

39
00:03:21,666 --> 00:03:24,625
What did I do with that new
calico chintz I had on before?

40
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:28,166
[YONA]
Father! Did I miss it?

41
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,166
Yes, my dear.
The ceremony is over.

42
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,041
No way!

43
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:33,041
I'm sorry. I lost track.

44
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:34,208
[laughing]

45
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:35,458
No worries.

46
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:37,541
After all, it was merely
a formality, my dear.

47
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:41,125
It was not necessary for you
to make an appearance today.

48
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:42,708
Father, be honest with me.

49
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:44,958
Do you think my red
hair is weird-looking?

50
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:47,500
Huh? Of course
I don't think that!

51
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:50,000
You are the most beautiful girl
in the entire Kohka Empire!

52
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:51,541
Yeah!
I do think that's true.

53
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:53,916
I was blessed with a beautiful
face, if I do say so myself.

54
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
But my hair!
It's the worst.

55
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:59,500
It's just so bright red,
and it's impossible to control.

56
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:01,541
It won't behave!
And on today of all days!

57
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:03,250
Darling, your hair is gorgeous.

58
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:04,958
Hak. Tell her.

59
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:07,833
Your hair's lovely, Princess.

60
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:09,125
There's nothing weird about it.

61
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:11,916
In fact, everyone in
the kingdom admires it.

62
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,166
Your hair's perfectly normal.

63
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,416
It's your brain that's weird.

64
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,916
Silence, servant!

65
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,166
Father, punish this cretin!

66
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:20,000
He's not allowed to
talk to me like that!

67
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:20,958
Now, now.

68
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:22,250
The way you fight,

69
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:24,041
it's hard to believe
you're childhood friends.

70
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:26,500
And let's not forget that
Hak is one of the five generals

71
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:28,250
charged with
protecting our castle.

72
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:29,250
He's the Wind Clan's greatest--

73
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:30,625
I couldn't care less!

74
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:33,375
Why couldn't you find a
charming man to protect us?

75
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:34,791
You're one to talk, Princess.

76
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:37,791
If you ask me, you could
use some charm, too.

77
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:39,000
Huh?

78
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:40,458
You know, since your
boyfriend's visiting.

79
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:42,208
Su-won is here.

80
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:44,666
Ugh! Why didn't you
say something earlier?

81
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:45,875
Su-won?

82
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:48,458
Is that why she was
worried about her hair?

83
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:51,000
He's seen it her whole life,
why worry now?

84
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:53,833
[HAK] She's developed a
crush on him lately, I guess.

85
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:56,750
[MAID 1A] Princess, come back!

86
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:59,125
[YONA] My love! He's here!

87
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:02,000
[YONA] Sweet Su-won,
who's been by my side

88
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:05,166
since we were kids
and was always so kind.

89
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:07,416
My cousin, who's
three years older than me.

90
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,541
Today, after so long,
I get to...

91
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:15,791
[YONA]
...see him!

92
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:18,791
[SU-WON] I see you're just as
full of energy as ever, Yona.

93
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:20,458
May I ask why you're
in such a hurry?

94
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:22,166
Well, I heard
that you had arrived,

95
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:24,000
and I wanted to be
the first to welcome you.

96
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:26,750
Aw. What a good girl.

97
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:28,500
So will you be staying?

98
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:30,916
Hopefully longer
than last time you visited.

99
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,500
Of course I am.

100
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:35,250
My favorite cousin's sixteenth
birthday is a monumental event!

101
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:36,625
[sighs]

102
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:39,000
I can remember when you
were just a little toddler!

103
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:41,250
You're growing up
way too quickly!

104
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:43,041
Now, where are
your father and Hak?

105
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:44,250
I'd like to say hello.

106
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:46,250
See ya, little Yona!

107
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:47,583
[YONA]
He treats me like a child!

108
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:50,458
It's so annoying!
I'm almost sixteen!

109
00:05:50,541 --> 00:05:52,000
I pulled out
all the stops for him

110
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:53,583
and he didn't even notice.

111
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:55,791
I'm wearing beautiful clothes
and put on the best makeup

112
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:57,208
that money can buy.

113
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:58,458
[HAK]
Talk about a waste of time.

114
00:05:58,541 --> 00:06:00,250
You shut your mouth right now!

115
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:03,083
[YONA] Stupid Su-won.

116
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:05,541
[YOUNG SU-WON]
What's the matter, Yona?

117
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:07,125
[YOUNG YONA]
Leave me alone!

118
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:09,916
Everyone says you haven't been
eating anything at all lately.

119
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,291
Your dad is
worried sick about you.

120
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:12,708
Go away!

121
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:17,000
[YOUNG SU-WON]
It's all right.

122
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:19,750
This way no one
can see your face.

123
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:22,958
Okay? Now you can cry
without anyone knowing.

124
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:28,666
[YOUNG YONA]
I haven't been able to sleep.

125
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:32,500
My mom, she always used to hold
my hand until I drifted off.

126
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:33,583
I know.

127
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:36,083
We all feel sad,
but I'm sure her death

128
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:38,416
is hardest of all for you.

129
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,791
I've got an idea!

130
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:42,083
I can do all the things
your mom used to do for you!

131
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:45,000
Well, first of all,
you've gotta eat something.

132
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:46,958
You can have this pear
my teacher gave me.

133
00:06:47,041 --> 00:06:48,125
Here you go!

134
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:53,708
I'll hold your hand until
you fall asleep, okay?

135
00:06:53,791 --> 00:06:56,041
It'll be just like what
your mother used to do.

136
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:58,041
I'll wipe away your tears, too.

137
00:06:58,125 --> 00:07:01,125
I'll do it so fast that no one
will notice you're crying.

138
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:04,333
Now, go to sleep
and wake up with a smile.

139
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:05,625
[YOUNG YONA] What a dummy.

140
00:07:05,708 --> 00:07:08,166
My heart is pounding
so hard in my chest.

141
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,666
I'll never be able
to sleep like this.

142
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:14,083
[YONA] Ever since that day,

143
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:16,291
he's the only one
I've ever loved.

144
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,291
Hi! Good morning, Su-won!

145
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:30,416
I packed a delicious
picnic for us!

146
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,291
Let's go eat in the--

147
00:07:33,708 --> 00:07:36,000
What's the matter, Yona?

148
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:37,708
If you're looking
for Lord Su-won,

149
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,750
he's at the targets
with General Hak.

150
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,041
It's so unfair!

151
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:48,958
Why does Su-won always
want to spend time with Hak

152
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:50,000
and never with me?

153
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:51,541
Now, now.

154
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:54,333
Those two haven't seen each
other in a long time, either.

155
00:07:58,625 --> 00:07:59,583
Hyah!

156
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:10,375
[SU-WON]
That was pretty impressive.

157
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:11,750
Good job.

158
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:13,291
[HAK] Thanks, and I can
tell you've been practicing.

159
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:16,541
I'll hit a bull's-eye soon.
Just like you did.

160
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:21,041
I want to be an
archer just like them!

161
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:23,083
That is absolutely
out of the question!

162
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:25,208
I wasn't even comfortable
letting those two

163
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:26,291
handle weapons!

164
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:28,291
But you've never
even done it yourself!

165
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:29,916
No, and I don't ever intend to.

166
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,583
Ugh, you're such a coward!

167
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:33,458
What kind of king is
afraid to use weapons?

168
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:34,875
[SU-WON] Yona!

169
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:35,916
Come join us!.

170
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,708
I'll teach you
how to ride a horse!

171
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:38,708
Okay!

172
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:39,833
Su-won!

173
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:45,166
[SU-WON] Just stay relaxed.

174
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,208
We're not going to
let you fall off, okay?

175
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:48,458
[YONA] You sure?

176
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:49,791
I know it's a big,
scary horse,

177
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:51,833
but I'm getting
kinda crushed over here.

178
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:53,208
I'll crush your dumb face!

179
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:54,375
[SU-WON] It'll be all right.

180
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:56,458
You do like horses, don't you?

181
00:08:56,541 --> 00:08:57,625
Yeah, I do.

182
00:08:57,708 --> 00:08:59,208
[YONA] But I love you.

183
00:08:59,291 --> 00:09:00,708
[gasps]

184
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:02,375
There's no need
for you to be scared,

185
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:03,750
I'll hold you tight.

186
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:05,250
[YONA]
His breath in my ear...

187
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:06,750
I've got chills.

188
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:09,708
[YONA] When we were kids,
he looked like a little girl.

189
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:11,666
He sure has changed.

190
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:14,166
Aren't we breaking
the rules riding like this?

191
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:15,500
Uh... I mean...

192
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:17,000
You seem like you
really understand

193
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:18,583
how to handle a woman.

194
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:20,666
I bet you have all the
ladies falling at your feet

195
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,666
everywhere you go, don't you?

196
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:25,541
[YONA] What are these words
that are coming out of my mouth?

197
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:27,916
So I'm right?

198
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,166
What?

199
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,875
No, not really,
not in the way that you mean.

200
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:32,125
But to be honest,

201
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:34,333
there has been some talk
of me getting engaged.

202
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:36,250
[YONA] Engaged?

203
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:37,083
[SU-WON] It's all right!

204
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:38,750
Nothing serious or definite.

205
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:41,750
Look, it's nothing you need
to concern yourself with.

206
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:44,500
You'll understand more
when you're a little bit older.

207
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:46,125
[YONA] Ugh, I'm not a baby!

208
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:47,541
Well...

209
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:49,833
I've been considering getting
married to someone, too.

210
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:50,958
To whom?

211
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:54,041
Hak, in fact!

212
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:57,791
[YONA] What am I thinking?

213
00:09:57,875 --> 00:09:59,250
Inventing some imaginary
boy would've been better

214
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:00,791
than telling him
I'm marrying Hak!

215
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:01,833
He'll know I'm lying!

216
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:02,916
Well, what was I supposed to do?

217
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,333
I don't know any
other boys my age!

218
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:06,500
Wipe that stupid look
off your face, servant!

219
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:08,958
No, wait. I meant...

220
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:11,166
[SU-WON]
I think that's wonderful!

221
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,250
Congratulations to you both.

222
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:15,833
[YONA] He's so cruel!

223
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:17,333
I can't believe you, Su-won!.

224
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:19,625
How could you
ever buy that story?

225
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:21,500
I think you're
cruel for saying it.

226
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:22,833
What a pain in the ass.

227
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:24,166
[IL] I hate to admit it,

228
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:26,833
but you getting married
might not be too far off.

229
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:28,583
It's time we start
thinking in earnest

230
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:30,375
about finding you
a suitable husband.

231
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:31,750
[YONA] But... No!

232
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:32,833
I want Su-won to--

233
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:35,083
You can never marry Su-won!

234
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:36,166
No, Princess, don't!

235
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:37,750
My love life is
none of your concern,

236
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:39,833
so you can't tell me
who to love or marry!

237
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:41,125
--That's my business--
--[IL] Yona...

238
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:42,375
Ever since you were a baby,

239
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:44,041
I've given you everything
you've ever wanted

240
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:46,250
without a moment's hesitation.

241
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:48,375
Everything but weapons.

242
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:51,500
Beautiful jewelry and
ornaments for your hair.

243
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:54,708
A royal villa
and botanical gardens.

244
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:57,416
But no matter how badly
your heart may ache for him,

245
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,666
I simply cannot allow you
to marry Su-won.

246
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:03,375
You are the only princess
of our beloved kingdom.

247
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:05,916
That's not something
to be taken lightly.

248
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,625
Your husband will one day
become king of this great land.

249
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:28,333
[YONA] I don't understand.

250
00:11:28,416 --> 00:11:30,916
He's the son of Uncle Yuhon,
your older brother.

251
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,958
Su-won is of royal blood.

252
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:33,958
[IL] Yes, that's true.

253
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:35,333
But as the king,

254
00:11:35,416 --> 00:11:37,666
it's my duty to choose
a successor to the throne.

255
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,291
Why not him?

256
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:41,458
Su-won is brave
and compassionate.

257
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:44,333
He can handle weapons
and behave justly,

258
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:46,708
while you're nothing
but a coward.

259
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:49,000
I have my reasons
for appearing cowardly,

260
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,333
you know that well.

261
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:52,250
Since your mother
was killed by insurgents,

262
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:53,750
I can't stomach violence.

263
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:56,000
The royal family lives
under the constant threat

264
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:57,583
of harm and danger.

265
00:11:57,666 --> 00:11:58,916
That's our lot.

266
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,458
It always has been
and always will be,

267
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:03,500
which is why I have
never remarried.

268
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:04,875
[IL] If you truly love Su-won,

269
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:07,375
let him be happy
and free from that burden.

270
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:13,916
[YONA] I don't understand.
I'm not sure that I ever will.

271
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,916
Does that mean
I have to marry someone

272
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,791
I wouldn't mind losing?

273
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:19,916
But that doesn't
seem fair to me.

274
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,625
Doesn't everyone deserve to be
with someone they truly love?

275
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:25,333
Oh, who am I kidding?

276
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:27,875
Even if I had father's approval,

277
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:30,083
Su-won would never
want to marry me.

278
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,958
I'll always be a child to him.

279
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:35,541
I guess that's it.
It's no use.

280
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:37,541
Su-won and I just
weren't meant to be.

[footsteps]

282
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:43,375
Hello? Who's there?

283
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:44,833
I know that it's you, Hak.

284
00:12:44,916 --> 00:12:47,583
I'm not in the mood
for your stupid games.

[YONA] No! It can't be!

I'm really sorry.

I didn't intend to frighten you.

297

You burst in like
someone was after you.

What's wrong?

299
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:33,458
I-I was being
chased by a strange man.

There's no one out there.

[YONA] He was! I swear!

[YONA] He ran away...
That means he was after me.

303
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:46,541
A guard wouldn't have hidden.

[SU-WON] Yona!

[YONA]
Was he trying to capture me?

306

Because I'm the
king's only daughter?

Please don't be afraid.

I can't.

I shouldn't be in here
alone with you like this.

[SU-WON] Why not?

Because.

[YONA] That's not--

320
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:24,125
[SU-WON] There's no need
to pretend you're not.

321
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:26,500
If the two of you
are to be married,

322
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:29,041
then I suppose you
and I shouldn't be alone.

323
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:32,750
[YONA]
No. It was a lie. I love you.

324
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:36,541
I know you don't see me
that way, but you must know.

325
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:41,541
I love you!
Su-won, I love you! I do!

326
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,166
[YONA] I always have.
I always will.

327
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:50,500
The rain's eased up.

328
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:53,291
It seemed like
it would never stop.

329
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:54,833
[YONA] Did he hear what I said?

330
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:56,958
[SU-WON] I'll take you
back to your own room.

331
00:14:57,041 --> 00:14:58,750
Better come along now.

332
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:01,416
[YONA] Wait... Su-won!
Listen to me!

333
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:09,208
Please, forgive me.
But you mustn't come any closer.

334
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:12,333
I may do something I'll regret.

335
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:14,416
Maybe I'm mistaken,

336
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,208
but when you told me
that you love me,

337
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:19,666
it sounded like
you meant romantically.

338
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:22,125
What if I said
you're not mistaken?

339
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:24,875
[YONA] If I do
love you romantically,

340
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:27,500
would you be upset?

341
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:31,416
[SU-WON] I'm overwhelmed.

342
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,083
I'm not sure what to tell you.

343
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:35,625
I've never seen you
as a woman before today.

344
00:15:37,416 --> 00:15:38,625
Huh?

345
00:15:38,708 --> 00:15:40,916
Then how have you seen me
all of these years?

346
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,500
Oh. Well, um...

347
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:44,958
I don't know, I guess I thought
of you like my little sister?

348
00:15:45,041 --> 00:15:46,875
That's what I suspected!

349
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:48,125
Sorry.

350
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:51,000
[SU-WON] Forgive me.
I can be a bit obtuse.

351
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:53,583
Especially when it comes
to matters of the heart.

352
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:57,083
[YONA]
His face. It's turning red.

353
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:59,666
Did you lie?
About being engaged?

354
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,125
No, I didn't.

355
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:03,166
I never said I was
officially engaged.

356
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:05,083
Merely that it had come up.

357
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:06,333
What now?

358
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:08,541
Do you still think of me
as your little sister?

359
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:10,208
I'll only say this.

360
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:13,166
I can't hold your hand
until you fall asleep anymore.

361
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:14,791
It's not appropriate.

362
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:18,041
And besides, I would
probably be up all night.

363
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:20,708
[YONA chuckles]
That's fine with me.

364
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:22,708
Knowing you
think of me that way.

365
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:25,708
Not like a sister,
but as something more.

366
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:27,000
That's enough.

367
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:28,166
That's all I need.

368
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:29,791
Yona.

369
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:31,083
[YONA] Father.

370
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:33,458
I hope you can forgive me
but I can't help it.

371
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:37,166
I love Su-won with all my heart
and nothing can change that.

372
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:39,458
Though I don't yet understand
the ways of the kingdom,

373
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:42,166
I do know that being with him
brings me more happiness

374
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:44,125
than I've ever felt before.

375
00:16:51,916 --> 00:16:53,916
[YONA] Five days later,
a banquet was held

376
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,041
at Crimson Dragon Castle
in celebration

377
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:58,083
of my sixteenth birthday.

378
00:16:58,166 --> 00:17:00,041
[MEN] Happy sixteenth
birthday, Princess.

379
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:01,458
May it be full of blessings.

380
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:02,666
Thank you all.

381
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,208
My sweet little girl.

382
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:07,041
I can't believe she's
already turning sixteen!

383
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:08,666
Yes, I know!

384
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:09,916
[IL] Having fun, dear?

385
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,208
[YONA] Why yes, thank you.

386
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:13,250
But my hair is
extra unruly today.

387
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:15,083
It's my birthday,
it should obey me!

388
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:16,291
Always the hair.

389
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:19,083
Why do I even bother
talking to you anymore?

390
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:21,250
[YONA] Su-won!

391
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:22,291
Wait!

392
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:29,375
Your Majesty.
Care for a drink?

393
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:31,833
Just what I needed.
Thank you.

394
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:34,416
[YONA] Um... Was there
something you wanted?

395
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,833
[SU-WON] Let me see your hand.

396
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:39,708
[YONA] A hairpin.

397
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:41,791
Sorry for pulling
you away from your party.

398
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:44,166
I wanted to give it to you
in person, to see your reaction.

399
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:46,208
I hope you like it.

400
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:48,416
[YONA] It's beautiful, but--

401
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,208
With my unruly red mane,

402
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:52,625
I don't think I could
wear something like this.

403
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:55,041
Only someone with pretty
hair could pull it off.

404
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:56,083
What?

405
00:17:58,375 --> 00:18:00,166
[SU-WON]
I think your hair is amazing.

406
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:02,083
Breathtaking.

407
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:03,875
Blazing crimson.

408
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:05,458
Just like the blush of dawn.

409
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:07,916
[YONA] Well, that was easy.

410
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,583
All it took was
one compliment from him

411
00:18:09,666 --> 00:18:11,833
and suddenly I love my hair.

412
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:16,583
Hak?

413
00:18:16,666 --> 00:18:19,291
The king has been looking
all over the castle for you.

414
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:23,541
So? Tell him I'm in
my room, resting for a bit.

415
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:24,875
Well...

416
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:27,541
I figured something was
going on between you two.

417
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:29,250
I'm sure you'll be
able to convince the king

418
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:31,000
to let you marry her, My Lord.

419
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:32,958
[SU-WON] Hak, it's not
like that, I swear.

420
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:34,083
Not at all.

421
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:36,083
And stop being
so formal with me.

422
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:38,291
It's weird when you act like
we haven't known each other

423
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:39,583
our whole lives.

424
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:42,958
Well, I know what
my place is in all of this.

425
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:43,833
Hey, listen.

426
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:45,750
Do you sense anything odd here?

427
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:48,458
I can't put my finger on it,
but something isn't right.

428
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:51,541
I feel an unwelcome presence,
like an intruder.

429
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:54,750
Yona mentioned
something to that effect

430
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:56,000
a few days ago, as well.

431
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:57,083
[HAK] She did?

432
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:59,041
You might want
to increase security.

433
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:01,083
There are a lot of
unfamiliar people here.

434
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:02,250
[HAK] Will do.

435
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:04,500
I'll put a few more men
on duty right now.

436
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:06,458
Stay with the princess,
would you Su-won?

437
00:19:12,708 --> 00:19:14,625
[YONA]
He called my hair "amazing."

438
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:17,208
He said it was "breathtaking."

439
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:19,750
No matter how badly
your heart may ache for him,

440
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:24,208
I simply cannot allow you
to marry Su-won.

441
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:25,791
[YONA]
I have to convince Father.

442
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:27,791
I won't let Su-won slip away.

443
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,958
I could never
love anyone but him.

444
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:33,958
I think he loves me, too,
and would brave any danger.

445
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:35,416
The door's open...

446
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,375
That seems careless
without any guards around.

447
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:39,250
[YONA gasps]

448
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:40,916
Something's not right.

449
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,791
Why aren't there guards
stationed out here?

450
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:45,083
I didn't see any of them
on my way, either.

451
00:19:49,541 --> 00:19:51,041
[YONA] Father, it's me.

452
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:03,791
[gasps]

453
00:20:03,875 --> 00:20:06,208
No... No! Father!

454
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:16,125
[SU-WON] I'm sorry you had
to see that, Princess Yona.

455
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:17,875
[YONA] What happened, Su-won?

456
00:20:17,958 --> 00:20:20,750
Please hurry!
My father needs help!

457
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:23,375
[SU-WON] There is no helping
your father now, Yona.

458
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:27,458
The king is dead,
and I killed him.

459
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:34,375
[HAK]
It's too quiet around here.

460
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:35,958
[MIN-SU] General Hak! Here!

461
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:37,916
I thought you might be
in need of refreshment.

462
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,083
Thanks!

463
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:41,375
You always know just
what I need, Min-su.

464
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:42,958
[MIN-SU] Why aren't you
with the princess?

465
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:45,916
I'm so used to seeing you by her
side as her protector, y'know?

466
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,708
Yeah, but it's awkward.

467
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:50,791
I'll let Su-won do the honors,
she's his problem now.

468
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:52,125
What?

469
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:53,500
She finally got the courage
to tell Lord Su-won

470
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:54,541
how she feels about him?

471
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:55,625
Not sure.

472
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:57,666
But it's only a
matter of time, really.

473
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:58,916
You know them so well,

474
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,291
it seems like you know
what they're gonna do

475
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:01,666
even before they do.

476
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,041
Well, we go way back.

477
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:05,208
We grew up together.

478
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:06,833
I wish them the best.

479
00:21:06,916 --> 00:21:09,333
Yeah. They're so well-matched.

480
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:12,541
They'll have a long,
happy life together, I think.

481
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:14,000
[YONA gasps]

482
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:17,625
Prepare yourself, Princess.

483
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:20,750
Your death is crucial to the
health of the Kohka Kingdom.

484
00:21:21,833 --> 00:21:24,708
[YONA] Su-won is the
only man I've ever loved.

485
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:27,375
All my life, I've only
had eyes for him.

486
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:30,708
Su-won!

487
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:53,000
How dare you commit
such a treasonous betrayal,

488
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:54,875
Lord Su-won.

489
00:23:33,416 --> 00:23:34,625
[YONA] Su-won, my love.

490
00:23:34,708 --> 00:23:36,625
How could you do this to me?

491
00:23:36,708 --> 00:23:40,958
After all that we've shared,
am I nothing but a joke to you?

492
00:23:41,041 --> 00:23:46,000
[YONA] Next time, on Yona of the
Dawn, Episode 2: "Broken Bond."
