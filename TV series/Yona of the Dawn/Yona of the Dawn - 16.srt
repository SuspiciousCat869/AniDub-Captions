Today, my people,

Okay, men,
I'll explain the rules.

43
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:16,125
We've split you into two teams.

44
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:17,625
The goal is to use
your wooden sword

45
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:19,416
to break your opponents' plates.

46
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,041
General Ju-do, I didn't
think he'd participate.

47
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:23,958
I know, neither did I.

48
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:26,250
[SU-WON] General Geun-tea
will be the red team's "king"

49
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:27,875
and I will be the white team's.

50
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:29,875
The rest of you will be
split into two ranks,

51
00:03:29,958 --> 00:03:31,708
"nobles" and "commoners."

52
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:33,416
The scoring goes like this:

53
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,166
commoners' plates
are worth one point,

54
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:37,541
nobles' are five,
and kings' are ten.

55
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:39,625
The team who scores
the most points wins.

56
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:42,666
The battle isn't over until all
of the plates have been broken.

57
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,000
The ranks can
get a little tricky

58
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:46,041
so let me go over that for you.

59
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:50,291
Now, you're allowed to
fight anyone of equal rank.

60
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:52,791
While the king can
break the nobles' plates,

61
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:54,875
he cannot break the commoners'.

62
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:57,250
The nobles can break
the commoners' plates,

63
00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:59,833
but they cannot
touch the king's.

64
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:02,791
Lastly, the commoners
can break the king's plate,

65
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:05,208
but not the nobles'.

66
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:07,875
If your plate is broken,
you become a prisoner.

67
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:09,375
Your teammates can
give you a spare plate

68
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:12,791
to return you to the game,
but it can only be done once.

69
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:13,958
Oh!

70
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:15,500
And if you break plates
outside your rank

71
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:17,208
or attack any other
area of the body,

72
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:19,500
you will be
disqualified, got it?

73
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:22,500
So, follow the rules
and we'll have fun today!

74

That's gotta be the worst
pep talk I've ever heard.

those words from you!

Well, they say that
great minds think alike,

79
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:34,500
so what do you think of
the king's combat skills?

80
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:37,291
I doubt they could compare
to the Lightning Beast's.

He was a natural.

He had the power of a warhorse,

84
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:45,500
but he rarely stepped
foot on the battlefield.

85

His courage and strength
were that of legend.

On the other hand,

about the king's combat skills.

You have to admit, his skin
is pale and his arms are skinny.

If the Lightning
Beast were a tiger,

92

then the king would be
a fluffy little rabbit.

has to do with anything.

easily be taught to anyone

No, sir, it's not
what you think.

It was all King Su-won.

He told us that you admire brave
men who face you in battle.

That's why we attacked.

how were you able to move
within the cloud of dust?

The white team
suffers from low morale

because many of the men
are Earth Clan members.

However, the king won them over

they were prisoners.

469
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:20,666
[YUNO]
There's one problem, though.

470
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,416
My tea garden's too small.

471
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,416
There's no way I could ever grow
enough to do business with them.

472
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,916
There's no need to worry.

473
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,500
You can always expand gradually.

474
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:29,750
--[YUNO] Uh.
--[GEUN-TEA] Huh?

475
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:31,791
Keep your business
small for now.

476
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:34,541
If you market it as
Chishin's local luxury tea,

477
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:37,125
then you'll attract more
tourists to the area.

478
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:39,375
You see, the harder
it is to get something,

479
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:41,750
the more people will want
to get their hands on it.

480
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:43,750
Why, thank you, Your Majesty!

481
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:46,375
[HUI-DAE]
Master Geun-tea!

482
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,291
We need help at the Udo Mine!

483
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:50,541
What happened? Was
there another cave in?

484
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:52,708
[HUI-DAE]
Nope, that's-that's not it, Sir.

485
00:18:52,791 --> 00:18:56,375
We don't have enough manpower!
We need more men to dig!

486
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:57,666
But it's been so slow.

487
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,291
[HUI-DAE]
Well, it's not anymore.

488
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:01,666
We can't keep up with
all the orders coming in.

489
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:04,041
Everyone loved the jewelry
you wore during the festival

490
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:05,291
and they want their own!

491
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:07,125
What? I don't know why!

492
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:09,500
I mean, the stone
isn't even all that shiny.

493
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:10,416
[HUI-DAE]
Mm.

494
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,916
Yes. That's what
we thought, too.

495
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,500
Imagine our surprise when we
had the craftsmen polish it

496
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:16,625
and it turned out
to be quite beautiful.

497
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:19,208
Guess it's more valuable
than we thought.

498
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:20,833
Besides, it's the stone
you were wearing

499
00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:23,083
when you won the mock
battle against the king!

500
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:26,333
Of course, everybody's
going to want one!

501
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:29,041
I got mine. Makes me
look flashy, huh?

502
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:32,000
No, it makes you look
utterly ridiculous, old man.

503
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:34,916
[laughs] You're just jealous.

504
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,791
[SU-WON]
Ahh. That was delicious.

505
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:40,291
Well, General, are you
ready to go now?

506
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:41,166
Yes!

507
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:42,208
[SU-WON chuckles]

508
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,958
[GEUN-TEA] I gotta admit, I'm
really impressed with you, Yuno.

509
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:50,208
You are? Why?

510
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:51,666
You've done so much for us.

511
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,791
You negotiated with
Kai Empire merchants

512
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:56,291
and found valuable gems
we didn't know we had!

513
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:58,375
I had nothing to do
with any of that.

514
00:19:58,458 --> 00:20:00,250
Hang on, you didn't?

515
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:01,958
I hate to let you down, my dear,

516
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:04,666
but all I really did was
serve tea to His Majesty.

517
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:06,916
He spoke to the
merchants on my behalf.

518
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,250
And sure, I picked your
outfit for the festival,

519
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,500
but King Su-Won is the one

520
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:12,833
who suggested you
wear all that jewelry.

521
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:15,416
Hey, where's the king?!

522
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,541
[BOTH]
Huh?

523
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:18,791
He and General Ju-do
left a while ago.

524
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:21,166
They're gone?

525
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:24,041
[JU-DO] You know, you never
cease to amaze me, Your Majesty.

526
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:26,875
You had this all planned out
from the start, didn't you?

527
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:28,166
[SU-WON chuckles]

528
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:30,708
I wanted to make him
realize his worth.

529
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:32,500
He had no idea
how much influence

530
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:34,041
he holds over his people.

531
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:36,750
He just sat inside his
castle, wasting away.

532
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:39,416
What does the Earth Clan
see in him anyway?

533
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:42,458
He's a pompous jerk who doesn't
deserve their admiration.

534
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:44,083
Now, now, don't be so harsh.

535
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:46,458
I happen to like him.

536
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:50,708
I must say, now that I've seen
him in action, I'm sold on him.

537
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:52,041
Indeed.

538
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:54,208
If there comes a time when
we are forced to go war,

539
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:56,666
I want General
Geun-tea on my side.

540
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:59,333
I'm certain that his people
would follow him anywhere.

541
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:03,291
So, with him comes
the entire Earth Clan.

542
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:05,375
It's the power
of Kouka's citizens

543
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:07,875
that will lead this
kingdom to victory.

544
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:11,583
[GEUN-TEA]
He left without sayin' a word.

545
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:13,625
King Su-Won tried
to play dumb with me,

546
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:17,000
but there's no way
that fall was an accident.

547
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:19,833
He didn't come here
to play some silly game.

548
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:22,000
[GEUN-TEA] No, he was more
interested in the tea gardens,

549
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:24,541
touring the mine,
and testing me.

550
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:27,166
[GEUN-TEA laughing]

551
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:28,583
Chishin is gonna be wealthy!

552
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:30,500
And it's all thanks
to our conniving king!

553
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:31,916
I gotta hand it to him, though,

554
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,208
I thought I had him all
figured out, but he fooled me.

555
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:39,083
I knew I wasn't imagining
that look that he gave me.

556
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:41,708
He seems like a rabbit,
but one look in his eyes

557
00:21:41,791 --> 00:21:45,000
and you can see the tiger
that's lurking inside of him.

558
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:49,000
So, in a way, he's even
scarier than Master Yuhon.

559
00:21:49,083 --> 00:21:50,125
Maybe this king
will be different

560
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:52,333
than the others before him.

561
00:21:52,416 --> 00:21:55,833
It'd be nice to have a monarch
that we can count on.

562
00:21:55,916 --> 00:21:57,416
Oh, well.

563
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:00,416
I guess I won't know for sure
until I see him in his element.

564
00:23:34,458 --> 00:23:36,416
[GREEN DRAGON] Being born
with a destiny is slavery.

565
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,666
It means you'll never
truly know freedom.

566
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,458
Nobody can force
me into servitude.

567
00:23:40,541 --> 00:23:42,708
Not even the
Crimson Dragon King.

568
00:23:42,791 --> 00:23:44,291
Next time on Yona of the Dawn,

569
00:23:44,375 --> 00:23:47,666
Episode 17: "Pirate of Awa."
