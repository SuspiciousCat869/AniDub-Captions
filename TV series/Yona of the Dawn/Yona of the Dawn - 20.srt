[ALL grunt]

3
00:00:14,875 --> 00:00:17,541
The scumbag preys
on women and children.

4
00:00:17,625 --> 00:00:20,958
But that's illegal. Slavery
is banned in Kouka Kingdom.

5
00:00:21,041 --> 00:00:23,583
Ya think he gives a crap
about breakin' the law?

6
00:00:23,666 --> 00:00:26,333
He has no fear 'cause he's
got manpower behind him.

7
00:00:26,416 --> 00:00:27,916
More than enough to crush us.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,625
And I bet he's aimin'
to do just that.

9
00:00:30,708 --> 00:00:32,750
Then let's strike first
and take 'em by surprise--!

10
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:34,500
That's the dumbest
idea I've heard.

11
00:00:34,583 --> 00:00:36,666
We can't attack Keum-Ji's
ships while they're in port

12
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:39,541
because we'd be putting
citizens in harm's way.

13
00:00:39,625 --> 00:00:41,000
That means...

14
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:43,000
...we'll just have to wait
until they hit open waters.

15
00:00:43,083 --> 00:00:44,541
I have a feelin'
the deal will go down

16
00:00:44,625 --> 00:00:48,083
somewhere between Awa
and the Kai Empire.

17
00:00:48,166 --> 00:00:50,041
One problem. We have
no way of knowing

18
00:00:50,125 --> 00:00:52,166
which of his ships
the women might be on.

19
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:53,958
We can't barge in
and put them at risk.

20
00:00:54,041 --> 00:00:56,041
We're going to have
to tread carefully.

True.

22

Knowin' that despicable bastard,

23
00:00:58,875 --> 00:01:00,750
he'll probably use
the ladies as hostages

24
00:01:00,833 --> 00:01:02,791
in order to keep himself safe.

25
00:01:02,875 --> 00:01:05,125
Let's think this over, boys.

26
00:01:05,208 --> 00:01:07,541
If only there was a way
for us to get 'em to safety

before we go in and attack.

Captain, this trade's
serious business, right?

29
00:01:12,583 --> 00:01:13,916
Chances are Keum-Ji's gonna be

30
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,916
in the big, fat middle
of everything.

31
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,958
Why don't we just find
his ship, sneak onboard,

32
00:01:18,041 --> 00:01:19,333
and take him captive?

33
00:01:19,416 --> 00:01:21,291
Yeah! We should be
able to pull that off,

34
00:01:21,375 --> 00:01:24,708
especially with the help of
our new super-strong crewmates.

35
00:01:27,416 --> 00:01:29,375
Either way, we're gonna
need some more information

before we move.

37
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,375
This might be our one and
only chance to stop Keum-Ji.

38
00:01:34,458 --> 00:01:36,958
We gotta make sure it
goes off without a hitch.

39
00:01:37,041 --> 00:01:38,875
We owe it to the people of Awa.

40
00:01:38,958 --> 00:01:41,500
They've been bullied
and abused for too long.

I don't like to brag,
but I'm an amazing chef.

166
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:43,083
I like to call this
"pirate's soup."

It's loaded with all
kinds of seafood.

That's not a bug, it's crab.

[SINHA]
Yona.

00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:31,416
Well, Captain,

186
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,000
the deal will take place two
days from now at sundown.

187
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:35,500
But that's so soon.

188
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:38,166
Ya got proof?

189
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:39,833
I found a trafficking
site in town

190
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:42,458
that's posing as
a regular store.

191
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:44,458
They advertise
high-paying jobs for women,

192
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:47,208
but when they show up looking
for work, they're taken captive.

193
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:49,125
I had a guy ask how long
they're taking applicants

194
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:51,416
because he knew someone
in desperate need.

195
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,083
The owner told him he'd
be willing to interview

196
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:55,958
interested young women until
noon, two days from now,

197
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:58,291
but absolutely no
later than that.

198
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:02,500
Yan Keum-ji's a greedy man.
He'll wait until the last second

199
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:05,166
if he thinks he can
capture another beauty,

200
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:08,041
which means he'll wait to make
the trade on that last day.

201
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:11,666
My guess is the ship will sail
at night, just after sundown.

202
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:12,791
You're prob'ly right.

203
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:14,208
The only thing that concerns me

204
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:17,708
is we won't know whicha
his ships the girls'll be on.

205
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:19,500
If we were onboard with them.

[GI-GANG]
Hmm.

207
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:22,333
If we infiltrate
the trafficking ring,

208
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:24,041
we can set off a
firework or something

209
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:25,750
while we're onboard
the girls' ship.

210
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:29,000
That's the only way we can do it
without putting them in danger.

211
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:30,958
Good plan, but
it's pretty risky.

212
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:33,250
No one's gonna
volunteer for that.

213
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,583
I will do it.

Personally, I think rescuing
the women should take priority.

[GIJA]
No way! I won't allow it!

232

It's far too dangerous for you

But--

235
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:18,500
In order to set off a firework,

236
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:20,166
you've gotta smuggle
gunpowder onboard,

237
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:22,500
escape captivity, get past
the guards and officers,

238

make it to the deck,

00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,333
and then light and
release the damn thing!

they're gonna kill you!

And besides,

243
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,583
the firework needs a big
blast to get our attention

244
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:34,125
while we're fighting.
It'll take a lot of gunpowder.

245
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:36,666
You wouldn't be able to
smuggle enough on by yourself.

as if she grew up without
a care in the world.

At others, she's got
a fire in her eyes,

Thank you.

314
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:29,666
For what?

315
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:33,291
Giving me the opportunity
to fight this injustice.

316
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:34,791
[GI-GANG]
Well, I woulda shot you down

317
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:37,791
if I didn't think you were
capable of handlin' it.

318
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:39,666
I'm impressed you're
willin' to risk your life

319
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:42,541
to save a bunch of ladies
you don't even know.

320
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:44,833
But you gotta be
careful out there.

321
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:46,208
[YONA]
I will.

322
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:50,750
[GI-GANG] All these years
I been askin' my men

323
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:53,250
to do the impossible.

324
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:54,625
Ain't easy defeatin' the enemy

325
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:57,458
when your captain
won't let you kill 'em

326
00:14:57,541 --> 00:14:59,958
But that's what my men have
been doin', and now I'm worried

327
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:02,166
'cause this'll be
their first real fight.

328
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:05,375
No need to worry.
My friends'll help 'em.

329
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:09,041
Listen, Yona, I want
you to promise me

330
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:11,333
you'll make it back
in one piece.

331
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,875
Even though I love my boys,

332
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:20,291
it's nice havin' a girl around.

333
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:22,583
You've become like
a daughter to me.

334
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:26,708
So, don't you dare go
and die on me, ya hear?

335
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:34,333
What's the matter?

336
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:36,041
[YONA]
I don't mean to cry.

337
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:39,416
It's just that I don't remember
much about my mother.

338
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:43,458
[YONA]
That's why I love watching you

339
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:45,083
interact with the crew.

340
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:47,791
You're strict, but it's
clear you care about them.

341
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:49,458
You correct them
when they're wrong.

342
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:51,750
You encourage them
when they're down.

343
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:56,041
Sometimes I think to myself,

344
00:15:56,125 --> 00:16:00,041
"So, this is what it's
like to have a mother."

345
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,125
I want to thank you...

346
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:05,625
...because... I've
never known till now.

347
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:34,333
[YONA gasping]

348
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:41,625
Tell me, Princess,
what can I do to stop you?

349
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:43,833
You can't.

350
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:45,041
[HAK]
Do you understand the danger

351
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:46,541
you're putting yourself in?

352
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:48,750
This isn't some silly game.

353
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:52,666
[HAK]
I just don't get it.

354
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:55,750
I promised your father
I'd protect you at all costs,

355
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:58,125
but it's like you won't let me.

356
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:02,083
[HAK]
It's so frustrating.

357
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:04,708
Why do you always have
to be so reckless?

358
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:08,750
Get off me, Hak! Right now!

359
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:11,500
[HAK grunts]

360
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:15,041
I know. I'm scared, too.

361
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:16,583
I'm sorry, but...

362
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:19,625
...I have to go through with
this for the people of Kouka.

363
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:22,208
[YONA]
Father led me to believe

364
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,791
that our kingdom was
wealthy and peaceful.

365
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:28,125
Full of smiling citizens
without a care in the world.

366
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:30,125
But now I know.

367
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:32,875
After seeing what's happened
to the Fire Clan's land

368
00:17:32,958 --> 00:17:37,000
and the corruption in Awa,
I know it was all a lie.

369
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:39,208
I suppose it's possible
that Father wasn't aware

370
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:42,250
of what was happening
outside of the capital.

371
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:45,000
But as his daughter,
I'm partially responsible

372
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:47,208
for what's become
of Kouka Kingdom.

373
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:51,000
I'm the only one who can
fix the mess he left behind.

374
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:54,583
You know nothing
of your kingdom.

375
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:58,166
You're the kingdom's princess.
You should know these things.

376
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:02,208
People suffered while I
lived in the lap of luxury,

377
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:04,125
and that's not fair.

378
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:08,458
This is my chance
to make it up to them.

379
00:18:08,541 --> 00:18:10,958
I won't stop. Let go.

380
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:31,708
What the hell is wrong with me?

381
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:34,875
I don't want her to go but
I couldn't stop her either.

382
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:40,625
Why am I trembling?

383
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,750
[HAK] Tonight I saw a
side of Princess Yona

384
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:46,375
that I've never seen before.

385
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:50,083
She stood up to me.
And I felt helpless.

386
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:52,958
Well, I guess,

387
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:56,208
I'll just have to do whatever I
can to make sure she succeeds.

388
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:02,000
[PIRATES]
Whoa.

389
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:04,625
Wow, you're lookin'
good, kiddo.

390
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:06,458
That shop owner'll love you.

391
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:07,875
I hope so.

392
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:11,041
Yong Keum-ji might try to
make you his new mistress.

393
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:13,916
Laugh it up! You're just
jealous of my beauty!

394
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,916
Hey, Yun. You have it?

395
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,125
I've got it hidden
inside of my dress.

396
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:21,041
It's a small firecracker,
but it's loaded with gunpowder.

397
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:22,541
If all goes well,

398
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:24,208
it should shoot up really high
and make a big explosion.

399
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:26,750
All right, it's time to get
this show on the road, ladies.

400
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:28,708
'Kay. We'll get go-- Uh...

401
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:31,125
I asked you for long sleeves.
What good is this going to do?

402
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:32,541
Sorry, there ain't
nothin' gonna cover

403
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:34,416
that big, ol' hand a yours.

404
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:38,750
[YONA] Very funny, but
don't even think about it.

405
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:41,916
If only my stupid dragon hand
was smaller and daintier.

406
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,083
[YONA] Yeah, 'cause
the rest of you is lovely.

407
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:45,958
[HAK]
Hey.

408
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:47,291
Listen, buddy,

409
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:50,458
you better save us as soon
as we give the signal.

410
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:51,666
Are you okay?

411
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,000
Of course.

412
00:19:55,916 --> 00:19:58,083
You think I'm
pathetic, don't you?

413
00:19:58,166 --> 00:20:00,041
I'm standing here
shaking like a leaf

414
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:02,000
while Yona's being so strong.

415
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:04,833
Don't worry.

416
00:20:04,916 --> 00:20:09,791
I know I said I'm a pacifist,
but I can fight if I have to.

417
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:13,000
Above all else, I'm a survivor.

418
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:15,750
I'm a lot braver than I look.

419
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:18,416
She's in good hands,
Lightning Beast.

420
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,458
I would lay down
my life for Yona.

421
00:20:20,541 --> 00:20:22,916
I'll make sure she
comes back to you alive.

422
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:26,583
[HAK]
I trust you.

423
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:30,625
[STORE OWNER] Hmm. So, you
ladies would like to work here?

424
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:32,250
Yes, if you're hiring, sir.

425
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:34,833
Rumor has it you pay more
than anyone else in town.

426
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:37,125
Ah. Yes.

427
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,333
Hm. Very well, then. You're
hired, welcome aboard.

428
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:46,708
What? Are you kidding me?
Wow, we're so lucky.

429
00:20:46,791 --> 00:20:49,541
If you'll follow me.

430
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:51,083
[BOTH chuckle]

431
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:53,833
[STORE OWNER] We hit the
jackpot with these beauties!

432
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:56,708
[STORE OWNER]
I need to step away for a bit.

433
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:59,666
Would you mind waiting
inside this back room for me?

434
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:03,375
[YONA]
Well, this is it.

435
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:05,541
Once I open this door.

436
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,875
[BOTH gasp]

437
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:19,500
[STORE OWNER] Go ahead and
make yourselves comfortable.

438
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:27,875
[YONA] Oh no, my legs are
starting to shake again.

439
00:21:27,958 --> 00:21:30,583
Why now of all times?

440
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:31,875
Yona.

441
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:33,291
[YONA, YUN yelp]

442
00:21:36,208 --> 00:21:37,375
[thud]

443
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:57,458
[YONA] And so began the longest
and darkest night of our lives.

444
00:21:57,541 --> 00:22:00,541
One day remained
before our true battle.

445
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,666
[YONA]
I know I have limitations.

446
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:37,666
At heart, I'm just
a regular girl.

447
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,166
I'm willing to lay down my life

448
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:41,125
if it'll make the world
a better place.

449
00:23:41,208 --> 00:23:43,375
Please, you have to
help me fight for you.

450
00:23:43,458 --> 00:23:45,833
Next time on Yona of the Dawn,

451
00:23:45,916 --> 00:23:48,000
Episode 21: "Spark."
