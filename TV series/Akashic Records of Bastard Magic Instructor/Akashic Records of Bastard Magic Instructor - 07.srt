No more, please, Professor.

I'm so sore.

That's just because
it's your first time.

[GLENN] Hey, being hard
on you is my job.

And I say you've already
improved since we started.

[GLENN] Make sure you
stay warm and supple.

12

I have just one more
question, Professor.

Why are we doing
hand-to-hand combat?!

got you hot and bothered

20
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:39,958
I thought I'd learn new spells.

21
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:42,833
Or that maybe you would teach me
how to boost my magic powers.

22
00:02:42,916 --> 00:02:44,583
But by training in this way,

23
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:47,916
we hone your sense of when to
attack or defend in magic duels.

24
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:50,583
[SISTINE] Or you're just
putting me through all this

25
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:53,250
because you think
I nag too much.

26
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:54,791
Of course, that's part of it.

I hate you!

Good! Channel it into your
hand-to-hand combat,

29
00:02:57,875 --> 00:02:59,708
because once you've
got it going on there,

30
00:02:59,791 --> 00:03:03,041
we're moving on to
military-grade magic.

Military magic?

32
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:06,416
Don't be scared.

33
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,666
I know it's intimidating,

34
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,666
but if you're serious
about protecting Rumia,

35
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,666
this magic is your best bet.

36
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:12,916
So buck up.

I know military-anything
isn't exactly cuddly.

But I'm confident
you can master this.

39

There's no way its dark
side is getting to you.

Well, at least I don't think so.

41
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,750
These things can still
be pretty tricky.

I wish to continue
my training with you!

No, it's not that.
