[bell ringing]

2
00:00:14,208 --> 00:00:15,291
[KASH]
Nah.

3
00:00:15,375 --> 00:00:17,125
You mixed it up;
it's the other way around.

4
00:00:19,083 --> 00:00:20,333
[GLENN]
Okay.

5
00:00:20,416 --> 00:00:22,625
Class today is pretty much
just reading this again.

6
00:00:22,708 --> 00:00:25,000
So you guys can
take it from here.

7
00:00:26,125 --> 00:00:27,791
[SISTINE]
What is wrong with this guy?

8
00:00:27,875 --> 00:00:29,666
Is he doing this every class?

9
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:31,208
Nothing's changed!

10
00:00:31,291 --> 00:00:33,666
I can't believe he's just
blatantly ignoring an agreement

11
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:34,833
between mages!

12
00:00:35,958 --> 00:00:37,916
[LYNN]
Excuse me. Sir?

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,041
Yeah, what is it?

14
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:42,250
I still don't understand
how to translate

15
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:43,666
these runic spells.

16
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:45,166
[SISTINE]
Don't waste your time.

17
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:46,333
But Sisti--

18
00:00:46,416 --> 00:00:47,791
There's no point in
asking him anything.

19
00:00:47,875 --> 00:00:49,041
He won't help you.

20
00:00:49,125 --> 00:00:50,666
Even if he could
answer the question,

21
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:51,875
he won't make the effort.

22
00:00:51,958 --> 00:00:54,208
He doesn't care about magic
or respect it.

23
00:00:54,291 --> 00:00:55,333
[LYNN]
Yeah, but...

24
00:00:55,416 --> 00:00:56,375
[SISTINE]
It's all right.

25
00:00:56,458 --> 00:00:57,291
I'll teach you.

26
00:00:57,375 --> 00:00:58,416
We'll take care of ourselves!

27
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,833
[GLENN]
Why should I care about magic?

28
00:01:00,916 --> 00:01:03,208
Why's it so great?

29
00:01:03,291 --> 00:01:05,791
Figures you'd respond
with ignorance.

30
00:01:05,875 --> 00:01:07,833
Magic is the study of
the world's principles.

31
00:01:07,916 --> 00:01:09,833
What could matter more?

32
00:01:09,916 --> 00:01:11,000
Huh?

33
00:01:11,083 --> 00:01:13,291
The origin and structure
of reality itself.

34
00:01:13,375 --> 00:01:15,833
The natural laws that
govern the entire world.

35
00:01:15,916 --> 00:01:17,333
Magic reveals all that,

36
00:01:17,416 --> 00:01:19,625
helping us understand
forces seen and unseen

37
00:01:19,708 --> 00:01:21,458
and answering the
eternal questions of why

38
00:01:21,541 --> 00:01:23,916
we and this world exist
and what our role can be.

39
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,708
It's humanity's lantern
in the dark,

40
00:01:25,791 --> 00:01:28,291
showing the path to a
greater plane of existence.

41
00:01:28,375 --> 00:01:29,708
That's why magic is great.

42
00:01:29,791 --> 00:01:31,916
Because it empowers us
with understanding.

43
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,666
[GLENN]
But what's its real use?

44
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:36,958
We can talk all day about
"why this" and "why that"

45
00:01:37,041 --> 00:01:39,000
but what does that
actually accomplish for us?

46
00:01:39,083 --> 00:01:39,875
[SISTINE]
What?

47
00:01:39,958 --> 00:01:41,333
What kind of question is that?

48
00:01:41,416 --> 00:01:43,125
Like I said, it reveals a
higher plane of existence--

49
00:01:43,208 --> 00:01:46,041
[GLENN] And what exactly
is on that higher plane?

50
00:01:46,125 --> 00:01:47,875
What, like gods?

51
00:01:47,958 --> 00:01:49,250
Well, it's just...

52
00:01:49,333 --> 00:01:51,125
[GLENN] I'm asking you
what tangible benefit

53
00:01:51,208 --> 00:01:53,166
humanity gets from magic.

54
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:54,500
Look at the field of medicine.

55
00:01:54,583 --> 00:01:56,166
It saves people
when they're sick.

56
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:59,791
Real, practical use
on a massive scale.

57
00:01:59,875 --> 00:02:02,333
That's true for agriculture,
and architecture.

58
00:02:02,416 --> 00:02:04,041
But what about magic?

59
00:02:04,125 --> 00:02:07,375
Is it just me, or does magic
not do crap for people?

60
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:10,666
That's unfair.

61
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,958
Magic may not feed or house us.

62
00:02:13,041 --> 00:02:15,875
But it provides something
greater than our basic needs.

63
00:02:15,958 --> 00:02:18,083
It's about searching for
the truth behind this world

64
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:20,083
--and life itself!
--[GLENN] Sorry, my bad.

65
00:02:20,166 --> 00:02:21,708
I've been lying.

66
00:02:21,791 --> 00:02:25,583
The truth is magic's incredibly
useful for one thing.

67
00:02:25,666 --> 00:02:26,833
For killing people!

68
00:02:26,916 --> 00:02:28,666
[SISTINE gasps]

[STUDENTS gasp]

70
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:32,791
[GLENN]
Think about it.

71
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:34,583
In the same time it takes to
kill one person with a sword,

72
00:02:34,666 --> 00:02:36,916
the right spell could
kill ten or more!

73
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,833
When it comes to mass murder,
magic is in a class of its own!

74
00:02:39,916 --> 00:02:41,166
[SISTINE]
That's not funny!

75
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,166
[GLENN]
I agree.

76
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:43,750
Now in the past,
magic and death

77
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:45,166
have gone hand in hand.

78
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,666
No!

79
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,541
[GLENN] The field of magic
doesn't give us anything good.

80
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:50,291
It's built on bloodshed.

00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:52,375
[SISTINE]
That's not what magic is about!

You come here every day
to study an art

85
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:59,750
that's only useful for
causing death and suffering!

86
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:02,208
Instead of devoting your
life to something so wretched,

do something good--

award goes to me.

Okay, I'm done with this job.

00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:47,166
I better practice
groveling when I get home.

If I kowtow hard enough,
Celica just might forgive me.

Hey, what's going on in there?

Oh, hi, Professor.

I'm sorry.

109
00:04:10,791 --> 00:04:11,833
I was just trying to
get some more practice

110
00:04:11,916 --> 00:04:13,625
creating a magic circle.

111
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:15,083
I'll clean up now.

112
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:15,958
[GLENN]
It's fine.

113
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:17,708
Might as well finish.

Thank you, but I
can't get it to work.

115
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:21,458
[GLENN]
Sure you can, dummy.

116
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:23,458
Just need more mercury.

117
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:24,833
You kids are too much.

118
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:26,875
You're all so hung up
on the forces you can't see

119
00:04:26,958 --> 00:04:28,250
that you don't pay
enough attention

120
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:30,750
to the stuff in plain sight,
right in front of you.

121
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:34,541
[GLENN] That shows you
think magic's more sacred

122
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:37,375
than it really is.

123
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:39,166
Now, try activating it again.

Use all five phrases,
like in the textbook.

125

No shortcuts.

126

Okay.

Oh, don't be silly.

134
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:11,416
It's a glorified parlor trick.

And most of the magic
was your doing, anyway.

See? Incredible, right?

[RUMIA] Professor Radars,
I think the truth is

138
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:34,416
you love magic.

139
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,958
[GLENN]
What makes you say that?

140
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:38,625
It looked like you were
really having fun back there.

141
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:40,541
You're confused, little lady.

142
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:42,583
I hate magic with a passion.

143
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:45,750
[RUMIA laughs]
Is that right?

144
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:47,791
May I ask what you were
doing before you became

145
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:49,791
a substitute teacher?

146
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:52,333
I'm proud to say I was
a freeloading shut-in!

147
00:05:52,416 --> 00:05:54,083
What? A shut-in, sir?

148
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:55,583
Are you serious?

You know Celica?

150

That high and mighty
professor at the academy?

151
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:02,708
I've been sponging off
her for the past year.

152
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:04,041
For a year?

153
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:05,541
What about before that?

[GLENN]
Okay, enough questions.

00:06:09,791 --> 00:06:12,083
What, are you launching
an investigation?

156
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:13,333
It's my turn now.

157
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,666
Why is everyone in
your class so high-strung

158
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,416
when it comes to learning magic?

159
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,250
You take spell-casting
way too seriously.

160
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:23,375
I don't know.

161
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:25,291
Guess I can only
speak for myself.

162
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:28,541
I understand your point
about magic causing damage.

163
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:30,083

[RUMIA]
Three years ago,

168
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:44,416
when I was banished
from my home...

169
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,458
Right around the time
I started living with Sisti

170
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:48,208
and her family.

171
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:51,500
I was captured by a group of
evil mages, and nearly killed.

172
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:54,708
That's when he came.

He swooped in and saved my life.

[VILLAINS yelling]

176
00:06:59,916 --> 00:07:01,291
[RUMIA]
I sat there, stunned,

177
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:03,833
as he defeated one
bad mage after another.

178
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:08,541
It was terrifying.

179
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,791
But that day,
when I saw magic used

180
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:14,333
for evil and good,

181
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:16,500
I realized I wanted to
help lead the human race

182
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:18,000
down the right path.

183
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:20,125
To use magic as we should.

184
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:23,541
But to do that,
I need to understand

185
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:25,958
magic better myself.

186
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:29,416
I hope if I stay on that road,
it will lead me back to him.

187
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:32,958
So one day,

188
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:36,500
I can thank him for saving me
and prove I was worth it.

189
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:38,375
To repay the man
who gave me light

190

when I was alone,
crying in the darkness.

191
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:43,666

before you go, Professor?

Would you mind
apologizing to Sisti?

198

Magic means a lot to her,
for lots of reasons.

199
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:10,000
Most of all, I think it
makes her feel connected

But that's okay.

Today, I'm gonna teach you
the truth about Shock Bolt.

239
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:53,041
We all know the standard chant.

240
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:54,583
"Thunder sprites, pay heed,

241
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:57,458
and strike with
your electric shock."

242
00:09:58,916 --> 00:10:00,583
The real shock is he
needs the whole chant.

This was like the
first spell we mastered!

Why's he wasting our time?

245
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:04,791
And as we all know,

246
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:06,916
mages with a real talent
for mana manipulation

247
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,916
can shorten it to
"Thunder sprites, shock"

248
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,208
for a quicker attack.

249
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:12,208
Here's my question for you.

250
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:13,625
"Thunder sprites, pay heed,

251
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:16,250
and strike with
your electric shock."

252
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:19,416
What happens if you split
this three-line chant

253
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,541
into four?

254

[GIBUL] If you don't pause
in the right places,

255
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:25,041
the chant will fail.

00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,291
And the spell won't
function properly.

You want a prize for
being obvious, dumbass?

258
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:31,750
Of course the spell
won't work as intended.

happen instead.

--[WENDY] That's impossible!

That's just one choice.

273
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:06,083
Make it five lines, like this...

274
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,750
And you shorten the range.

275
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:11,166
Or drop this part
and the output plummets.

276

If you're claiming
you've mastered this spell,

277

you should know all this, right?

278
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:18,583
Look. In short, magic is
just an advanced form

279
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:19,791
of autosuggestion.

280
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:21,333
Self-hypnosis.

281
00:11:21,416 --> 00:11:23,000
We use the runic
language for spells

282
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:24,416
'cause it's the
most efficient way

283
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,666
to achieve that reshaping
of the human subconscious.

284
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,666
Then it's our minds,
not the spells,

285
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:32,416
that manipulate the principles
governing reality.

You may think magic's
all about studying

00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:36,416
the laws of the world
outside of us.

More than anything,

290
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:42,083
magic is about probing
the heart of mankind.

291
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:43,291
You're skeptical.

292

more than just words,

so much power, right?

Anyway, let's move on.

312

Since it is about the language,
the grammar and syntax matter.

313

00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:49,416
deep in your own subconscious.

326
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,458
That's all spells are.

327
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:53,500
It's an association game.

328
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:55,875
A minute ago, I gave your
classmate a nickname.

329
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:57,791
Now what do you think
when you look at her?

330
00:12:57,875 --> 00:12:59,166
--[WENDY] A cat.
--[TERESA] Yeah, a cat.

[GLENN]
Chants work the same way.

332
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:02,416
Make an association,

333
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,208
and your mind can recall
the power however you want.

334
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:06,583
It's easy.

335
00:13:06,666 --> 00:13:09,166
So sure, you can translate
and memorize chants

336
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:11,625
exactly how this
lame textbook says.

337
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:13,750
But if you don't
understand why it works,

338
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:15,333
then you'll just be
continuing the same

339
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:17,708
"magic for dummies" classes
you've apparently been taking

340
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:19,875
since you came to this school.

341
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:21,583
[laughs] No thanks.

342
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:26,333
[GLENN] Right now, you kids are
nothing but mindless mimics

343
00:13:26,416 --> 00:13:28,500
who can recite the
spells you've been told.

344
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:30,458
But if you want to
become true mages,

345
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:33,583
you've got some
serious gaps to fill.

346
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:36,875
Now. We're going back to basics
so you can learn 'em right.

347
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:39,166
If you're not into that,
you can just sleep.

[RICK] His lectures
are becoming so popular,

352

353

Well that's because he
was my greatest apprentice,

Damn you, Glenn Radars!

I'll get you out
of this academy.

358
00:13:59,791 --> 00:14:01,166
You'll see!

359
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,666
The first thing you need
to learn about original magic.

360
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,250
It's not any more
special or sacred

361
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:07,083
than the standard stuff
in your books.

362
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:09,375
You seem to have this idea
that inventing unique spells

363
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:12,083
is this huge thing,
like you're not worthy to try.

364
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:14,333
But trust me,
trying's not a big deal.

365
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:16,583
The real challenge is
making something better

366
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:17,791
than existing spells,

367
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:19,125
which were
painstakingly developed

368
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:22,291
by countless mages
over the years.

369
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:24,875
'Cause if it's not better,
what's the point, right?

[GLENN]
Who woulda' thought?

This really isn't so bad.

Oh, nothing at all.

I just came to say well done.

378
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:55,916
You've perked up a bit.

379
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,875
Up until recently,
you looked like a caught fish

380

who'd been dead
for a month or two.

381

But I've noticed a change.

382
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:03,666
Now it looks like you've
only been dead for a day.

Hey!

I know you were worried.

I'm sorry for that.

All righty.

Tomorrow, I leave for
a magic conference.

388

Normally, you could come, too,

but after Professor Huey's
departure, your class is behind.

You'll have to stay here.

Don't play any weird
pranks on the girls

392
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:27,458
just because the rest
of the professors are away.

Hey, Sisti.

00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,958
There's nothing
I hate more than a liar.

484
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:50,583
[SISTINE]
What's this about?

485
00:18:50,666 --> 00:18:52,625
What are you planning
to do with Rumia?

486
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:54,250
You're asking that
like you know her.

487
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:56,333
Why don't you just
answer my question?

488
00:18:57,625 --> 00:18:59,125
I warned you once.

489
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:01,458
--Bye--
--[RUMIA] I'm Rumia.

490
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,125
Oh?

491
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:13,041
So you were right
here all along?

492
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:15,166
Yeah. We knew, of course.

493
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:16,833
I was just playing
a fun little game

494
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:19,375
where we'd kill all your
classmates until you fessed up.

495
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:23,500
Okay, that's enough
messing around.

496
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:24,833
[EVIL MAGE 2C]
Yeah, yeah, fine.

497
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:26,416
[EVIL MAGE 2B]
Let's go.

498
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,583
No, Rumia, don't!

499
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:28,916
It's all right.

500
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,791
I'm sure Professor Radars
will come to the rescue

501
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:31,958
soon enough.

502
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:33,041
[EVIL MAGE 2C]
You mean your substitute?

503
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:34,708
We already killed that twerp.

504
00:19:34,791 --> 00:19:36,541
--Liar!
--That can't be...

505
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:39,375
[EVIL MAGE 2B]
Now come.

506
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:46,250
[RUMIA]
What are you after?

507
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:47,833
Why are you taking me?

508
00:19:47,916 --> 00:19:50,583
[EVIL MAGE 2B] You should know
perfectly well, Rumia Tingel.

509
00:19:50,666 --> 00:19:53,458
Or should I say
Princess Ermiana?

510
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:56,708
You're supposed to be long gone,
and yet here you are.

511
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:59,958
A royal girl everyone
thinks is dead.

512
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:02,916
That makes you a rather
valuable card for us to play.

513
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
[SISTINE yells]

514
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:06,833
[EVIL MAGE 2C]
Ya know, you're a pretty girl.

515
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:09,458
Be a waste not to enjoy you.

516
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:11,958
[SISTINE] I'm the daughter
of the proud house of Fibel!

517
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:13,791
That supposed to impress me?

518
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:15,375
I have a real eye for this,

519
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:18,458
and to be honest, having my way
with girls like Rumia isn't fun.

520
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:20,958
She may look weak,
but she's the type whose spirit

521
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:23,000
won't break no matter what.

522
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:25,583
You, on the other hand...
You're the opposite.

523
00:20:25,666 --> 00:20:27,541
You act tough,
but you're just a child

524
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:30,500
hiding your weakness
behind a mask.

525
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:33,166
I enjoy breaking girls
like you most of all--

526
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:34,833
feeling you melt all around me.

527
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:38,125
Screw yourself!
I'll never submit to you!

528
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:41,958
[gasps]

529
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:44,333
[EVIL MAGE 2C]
Huh?

530
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:48,500
[snickers]

531
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,833
What pretty skin you have.

532
00:20:57,916 --> 00:21:01,000
[SISTINE]
Please. Stop.

533
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:03,208
What's that?

534
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:05,750
Just please, don't hurt me.

535
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:06,583
Please don't.

536
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:08,125
[EVIL MAGE 2C laughs]

537
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:10,083
You're breaking down already?

538
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:11,583
This is gonna be a blast!

539
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:13,833
[SISTINE]
No... Someone, save me!

540
00:21:13,916 --> 00:21:17,166
Let's get this party started!

541
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:18,291
Hm?

542
00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:22,708
Huh?

543
00:21:22,791 --> 00:21:24,541
[EVIL MAGE 2C]
Who the hell are you?

544
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:25,791
Sorry. I can leave.

545
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:27,500
[SISTINE]
Help, you idiot!

546
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:29,625
[GLENN sighs] Look, sock hat.

547
00:21:29,708 --> 00:21:31,833
I get it, girls think
you're disgusting.

548
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:33,583
But this aint gonna change that.

549
00:21:33,666 --> 00:21:35,250
Oh, no. Professor, get out!

550
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:37,583
First you tell me to help,
now you're tellin' me to leave.

551
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:39,166
Which is it?

552
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:40,541
[SISTINE] He's about to fire!
I'm saying get out of the way!

553
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:42,041
[EVIL MAGE 2C]
Too late.

554
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:43,125
[SISTINE gasps]

555
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:44,416
Bang.

556
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:49,125
[EVIL MAGE 2C]
Huh?

557
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:50,541
Bang! Bang!

558
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:52,916
[GLENN]
Your magic won't work anymore.

559
00:21:54,291 --> 00:21:56,250
[EVIL MAGE 2C]
The Fool arcana?

560
00:21:58,375 --> 00:22:01,125
[GLENN] By using the magic spell
that I've tied to this card,

561
00:22:01,208 --> 00:22:03,916
I can completely seal off
the activation of all magic

562
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,791
within a set range, centered
around yours truly.

563
00:22:10,375 --> 00:22:12,708
[GLENN]
That's my original spell.

564
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:15,375
It's called The Fool's World.

565
00:22:15,458 --> 00:22:17,083
Your own original spell?

566
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:19,875
You're telling me a mage
like you is on that level?

567
00:22:19,958 --> 00:22:22,958
[SISTINE] Sealing his enemy's
magic would make him invincible.

568
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:26,458
Heh. Of course, my spells
won't work either.

569
00:22:26,541 --> 00:22:27,958
[SISTINE, EVIL MAGE 2C]
Uh?

570
00:22:28,041 --> 00:22:30,750
[GLENN] I mean, obviously.
I'm in the effective range, too.

571
00:22:30,833 --> 00:22:32,208
[EVIL MAGE 2C laughs]

572
00:22:32,291 --> 00:22:34,125
How exactly is a mage
supposed to fight

573
00:22:34,208 --> 00:22:35,666
if he seals his own magic?

574
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:36,708
You idiot!

575
00:22:36,791 --> 00:22:38,083
[SISTINE]
We're done for!

576
00:22:38,166 --> 00:22:39,083
[chuckles]

577
00:22:39,166 --> 00:22:40,500
Get out before--

578
00:22:45,125 --> 00:22:46,625
You! You're dead!

579
00:22:46,708 --> 00:22:48,250
[EVIL MAGE 2C yells]

580
00:22:50,583 --> 00:22:51,541
[EVIL MAGE 2C]
Huh?

581
00:22:59,833 --> 00:23:02,875
That's the Imperial Army's
hand-to-hand combat style.

582
00:23:02,958 --> 00:23:06,000
Just who the hell are you?

583
00:23:06,083 --> 00:23:09,500
I'm Glenn Radars.
Substitute teacher.

584
00:23:09,583 --> 00:23:13,083
But if you're still alive,
that means you defeated Carrel!

585
00:23:13,166 --> 00:23:14,333
That's impossible.

586
00:23:14,416 --> 00:23:16,333
Some mage who challenges
people to fist-fights

587
00:23:16,416 --> 00:23:17,583
could never beat him.

588
00:23:17,666 --> 00:23:18,875
[GLENN]
Good grief.

589
00:23:18,958 --> 00:23:20,416
If you're that freaked
out by the whole

590
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:23,458
non-magic combat thing, I can
try to make you feel better.

591
00:23:23,541 --> 00:23:25,833
I'll finish you with the
legendary super magical

592
00:23:25,916 --> 00:23:27,666
iron fist Magical Punch!

593
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:28,833
Here goes!

594
00:23:28,916 --> 00:23:33,000
Magical...

595
00:23:33,083 --> 00:23:35,583
...Punch!

596
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:38,583
[chuckles]

597
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:45,000
[EVIL MAGE 2C]
That was a kick.

598
00:23:45,083 --> 00:23:48,125
Well yeah, that's the part
that makes it magical.
