Talk to me, Re=L!

00:00:15,958 --> 00:00:18,541
[RE=L]
I wish I had another choice.

4
00:00:18,625 --> 00:00:20,833
But if I'm not dedicating
myself to my brother

5
00:00:20,916 --> 00:00:23,291
and this cause,
then what am I living for?

6
00:00:27,916 --> 00:00:29,166
Please help me.

7
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,500
It's you.

8
00:00:36,333 --> 00:00:37,500
I'm so sorry.

00:00:37,583 --> 00:00:38,750
I'm too late.

[ALBERT] You're as
resilient as ever, Glenn.

13
00:00:49,291 --> 00:00:50,958
I guess I owe you pretty big.

[ALBERT]
You should thank Miss Fibel.

15
00:00:52,916 --> 00:00:54,583
Without her assistance,
the Reviver spell

16
00:00:54,666 --> 00:00:56,041
never would have worked.

Her mana capacity is impressive.

[GLENN chuckles]

00:01:03,666 --> 00:01:06,166
I've had my
suspicions for a while.

20

You really are amazing,
white cat.

21
00:01:08,625 --> 00:01:11,541
A pain in my ass, but,
most the good ones are.

22
00:01:11,625 --> 00:01:13,708
[ALBERT] We may be able to
count on her in our mission

00:01:13,791 --> 00:01:15,083
to free the princess.

24

Let's not be stupid.

25
00:01:16,458 --> 00:01:17,875
She's a kid, Albert.

26
00:01:17,958 --> 00:01:19,166
She stays.

27
00:01:20,333 --> 00:01:22,208
So what are we up against?

28
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:55,458
[GLENN]
Damn it, Re=L.

29
00:02:56,833 --> 00:03:00,083
[ALBERT] I warned you to be
careful when it came to her.

30
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:01,708
What else did you see coming?

31
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:04,041
Did you think the Researchers
of Divine Wise-Assery

32
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:05,416
might show up here too?

33
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,750
I did.

34
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:08,625
One of our investigations
revealed a suspicious

35
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:09,666
flow of money.

36
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,375
Someone sending
a lot of new funding

37
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:13,000
to the white alchemy lab.

38
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:15,125
We probed further,
and found a likely connection

39
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:17,250
between the Researchers
and the lab's director,

40
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:18,458
Burks Blaumohn.

41
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:21,583
Then why didn't you tell me
the last time we talked,

42
00:03:21,666 --> 00:03:23,500
when you knew we
were coming here?!

43
00:03:23,583 --> 00:03:24,541
[GLENN]
Oh, of course.

44
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:26,041
Because you were
using Rumia as bait

45
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:27,500
to draw them out.

46
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:29,041
Did that come from
military command?

47
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:31,041
Or your precious leadership?

48
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:32,791
Damn you!
You could have helped!

49
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:35,333
I'm sure you know
why I couldn't object.

50
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,750
'Cause if they turn
their eyes on you,

51
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:40,875
they could learn
the truth about Re=L.

52
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:42,125
I get you were in a bind,

53
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:44,125
but that doesn't excuse
you letting this happen.

54
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:45,333
Rumia's been through so much

55
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:47,250
and now you've used her
for convenience!

56
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:50,500
My superiors are dishonorable
for issuing this order.

57
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:53,000
Going along with it
makes me just as bad.

58
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:54,541
I don't deny it.

59
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:57,458
But I've given Re=L her chance,
and now I'm done with mercy.

60
00:03:57,541 --> 00:03:59,958
If she continues to stand
on the wrong side,

61
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:01,750
then I will destroy her.

62
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:03,166
No, that's not the answer.

63
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,833
Re=L's just confused.

64
00:04:04,916 --> 00:04:06,625
We have to show her the truth.

65
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:08,208
I should have done
that two years ago

66
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:09,500
back when I found her.

67
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,833
But now she's siding
with her brother, right?

68
00:04:11,916 --> 00:04:14,125
You honestly think she's
going to listen to you?

69
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,625
I'll make her!

70
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:17,583
She's gonna listen even
if I have to pound it

into her stubborn little head!

72
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:22,500
You've got some nerve
playing the hero.

73
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:23,750
You ran away.

74
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:26,791
Abandoned your comrades
without a single word.

75
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:28,750
If you want to understand
Re=L's betrayal,

76
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:30,541
then you should
start with your own.

00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:31,750
You broke her heart.

78
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:34,125
I'm not sure you even
deserve to save her.

You blame me.
Well blame yourself!

Look, I know,
and I'm not gonna argue

with any of that, okay?

82
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:41,541
I screwed up.

I know don't deserve
to be her friend!

84

But I am her teacher
and she needs my help!

put my faith in you.

Though I can't take sole credit.

114
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:13,666
You gathered all three elements.

115
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,250
And you even
persuaded an enemy

116
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,708
to switch sides and
bring us the Amplifier.

117

I have to say, you're quite
a resourceful young man.

You honor me with
your praise, Director.

I just knew we had to capture
the Amplifier somehow.

Since we lack the

it was the only way.

In that case, enjoy the view!

128

the Researchers of
Divine Wisdom are evil.

are the true purveyors

An empire led
by a family like that

deserves a swift downfall
if you ask me.

That's enough, Burks.

What have they done
that's so wrong?

Yes.

After the incident at
the magic competition,

150
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:47,375
I planted the first
on the princess,

151
00:07:47,458 --> 00:07:49,750
to tell me her
whereabouts at any time.

152
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:52,375
[GLENN] So that's how
you know where she is?

[ALBERT] No, unfortunately
that one was dispelled.

But I planted another one.

On Eleanor Chalet.

out those terrorists

Come on, Re=L.

323
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:24,500
You sure you want to fight me?

324
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:26,916
I'd say you've taken this
little prank far enough.

325
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,375
Talk all you want, Glenn.

326
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:30,583
I'll protect my brother
to the very end.

327
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:31,583
[GLENN]
You idiot!

328
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:33,250
This is all just a trick!

329
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:35,583
Your brother's as dead as
this chode's about to be!

330
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:36,708
Shut up!

331
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:38,458
Yelling at me won't
make it less true!

332
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:40,791
How can you deny it when
he's standing right there?!

333
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:42,250
Listen, Re=L, you're confused!

334
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:44,041
[RE=L]
Shut up, shut up, shut up!

335
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:48,541
[GLENN] Damn it, she doesn't
want to listen to me.

336
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:49,958
How do I make her see?

337
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:53,583
[GLENN]
Come on, Re=L.

338
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:55,083
Bring it on!

339
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:56,708
[RE=L yells] 

340
00:14:57,833 --> 00:14:59,000
[GLENN]
Albert's right.

341
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:00,666
It's my fault for not
telling her the truth,

342
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,541
and for running
away without her.

343
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:04,166
But I'm not running now.

344
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,625
She just has to hear me!

345
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:07,708
[RE=L yelling]

346
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:09,083
Hey! Stop!

347
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:11,750
Don't do this, Re=L,
I know he's trying to help you!

348
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:12,833
Don't hurt him!

349
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:15,083
He's too important!
To all of us!

350
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:17,166
And you're important
to us too, Re=L.

351
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,791
We care about you.

352
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:21,375
Don't you remember the stars?

[RE=L gasps]

354
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:23,958
[GLENN]
Now's my chance!

355
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:26,041
[GLENN] Turning on Rumia
must've been hard.

356
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:28,208
So you really love
your brother that much?

357
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:30,291
Yes, he means everything to me.

358
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:33,000
That's why I've decided
to dedicate my life to him.

359
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:46,708
I guess I didn't want to
believe 'cause I was jealous

360
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:48,416
he meant so much to you.

361
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,166
[RE=L]
What are you saying?

362
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:51,625
I'm saying if you'd
do this for him,

363
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:54,208
he must be a great guy and
I should give him a chance.

364
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:56,375
So, introduce us.
What's his name?

365
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:58,375
Why are you asking me that now?

366
00:15:58,458 --> 00:15:59,166
Re=L!

367
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,958
He's stalling. Finish him!

368
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:02,875
Oh, come on,
it's a simple question.

369
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:04,458
Tell me his name
and I'll back down.

370
00:16:04,541 --> 00:16:06,500
Don't listen,
he's playing mind games!

371
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:08,916
[GLENN]
Say it, Re=L. I'm waiting.

372
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,041
His name?

373
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:12,666
[GLENN]
What's wrong?

374
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:15,583
[RE=L] My brother's name.
My brother's--

[gasps]

376
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:18,791
My head hurts.

377
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:20,208
What's happening?

378
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:23,541
My brother's name--
What's wrong with me?

379
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:25,166
Why can't I remember it?

380
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,750
It doesn't matter if you forgot!

381
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:28,875
I'm still your brother!

382
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:29,958
[RE=L]
Huh?

383
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:33,458
[GLENN] Let the plate
of order tip to starboard.

384
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:44,208
[GLENN]
It was a risky bet.

385
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:45,666
Get off me.

386
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:46,791
You can't win.

387
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:48,833
This isn't my strength
you're feeling.

388
00:16:48,916 --> 00:16:50,041
It's gravity.

389
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:51,875
Gravity manipulation?

390
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:57,625
Just sit tight,
and I'll take care of this.

391
00:16:57,708 --> 00:16:59,333
You get away from my sister!

392
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:00,291
[GLENN]
Shut up.

393
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:01,791
Your con-game's over!

394
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:08,458
[GLENN growls]

395
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:09,666
How could you?!

396
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,291
I knew when you said Re=L.

397
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:15,791
Next time you want
to pose as her brother,

398
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:17,958
you should go with
the girl's actual name!

399
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:23,041
We called it
"Project Revive Life."

400
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:26,291
Or for short, Project Re=L.

401
00:17:29,791 --> 00:17:31,291
[RE=L]
That's right.

402
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:34,375
My brother's name was Sion.

403
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:38,333
[RAINER] I decided to
name Illushia's copy

404
00:17:38,416 --> 00:17:39,708
after the project.

405
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:41,958
Has a nice ring,
don't you think?

406
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:43,500
[RE=L (ILLUSHIA)]
Re=L?

407
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:45,583
[SION]
Rainer. We need to stop this.

408
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:47,500
How many innocent people
have we sacrificed

409
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:49,583
just to make this one clone?

410
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:51,625
You can leave the group with us.

411
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:53,333
I've already made arrangements.

--[SION] Rainer...
--[RE=L (ILLUSHIA)] No!

415
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:03,291
[SION]
Illushia, run!

416
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:08,375
I don't need you
anymore either, Illushia.

417
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:11,041
Since I already have your
three elements in hand,

418
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:13,458
I'll put you to rest
right next to your brother.

419
00:18:14,916 --> 00:18:19,291
[RE=L] I remember now
who I--no, what I am.

420
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:21,791
[RAINER] Two years ago,
Sion betrayed the project

421
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:25,041
and reported us to the
Imperial Court Mage Corps,

422
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:26,583
which led to them
raiding our lab

423
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:28,375
and setting us back till now.

424
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:31,000
[GLENN]
Yeah, I know all about it.

425
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:33,416
I'm the one Sion contacted.

426
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:36,000
[SION]
The project's almost finished.

427
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:37,666
All they need now
is my original spell

428
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,541
to complete the ritual.

429
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:41,416
I'm the only one
there who can cast it.

430
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,125
If I leave, they're stuck.

431
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:45,291
But Glenn. If I help you...

432
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,541
There are two others
I want to save.

433
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:49,000
We've been through
everything together.

434
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:50,833
Friends our whole lives.

435
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:52,000
And their names?

436
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:54,166
Illushia and Rainer, sir.

437
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:56,291
[GLENN] He went to
arrange your extraction,

438
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:58,958
then we lost contact
so we raided the lab.

439
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:02,208
But Sion was already dead.

440
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:04,708
And his sister was
too wounded to save.

441
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:08,916
[GLENN] All I could do
was protect the copy.

442
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,916
The manufactured girl
who had inherited

443
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,666
Illushia's Astral Code,

444
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,333
and all her memories
right up to the moment

445
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:15,500
of her death.

446
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:18,291
The copy.

447
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:20,458
That's me.

448
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:22,875
I thought I had altered your
memories to suit my needs,

449
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:24,916
but I guess I didn't
have time for a full scrub

450
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,375
before we were raided.

451
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:28,583
Oh, well, the first
draft's always junk.

452
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:29,875
Look, you bastard.

453
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:31,583
Don't talk about her like that.

454
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:33,958
But it's just the truth,
she is junk!

455
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:35,083
A broken egg.

456
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:36,208
Damn you!

457
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:37,375

458

pierce with your
brilliant lance of light!

00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:49,041
Let me introduce the
new and improved model.

460
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:53,083
Aw, hell.

461
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:55,083
Now these girls
are real perfection.

462
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:57,458
I eliminated all
those pesky emotions,

463
00:19:57,541 --> 00:20:00,250
which makes them so
much easier to control.

464
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:02,583
I call them my little
army of puppets.

465
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:03,541
Now, girls!

466
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:05,208
Destroy these intruders!

Woo!

469
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:28,458
That was way too close.

470
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:30,833
Why protect something worthless?

471
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:32,250
I'm just a copy.

Shut up, dummy.

You answered your own question.

475
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:38,250
I wouldn't risk my life
if you were worthless!

476
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:42,333
But I'm a doll.

00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:43,916
What worth can I have?

478
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:44,958
Nah.

479
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:46,583
A doll wouldn't
be moping like that!

[grunting]

481
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:50,666
I don't see you
as a doll or copy.

00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,083
And neither does
white cat, or Rumia,

483
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:53,458
or the rest of the class!

484
00:20:53,541 --> 00:20:55,125
That's right, you're our friend!

485
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:57,166
There, you see?

486
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:58,291
But I've been cruel.

487
00:20:58,375 --> 00:21:00,250
I've done terrible
things to you.

488
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:02,041
And Sistine and everyone else!

489
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:04,000
[GLENN grunts]
Then apologize later!

490
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:07,250
--[GLENN yells]
--[RUMIA] Professor!

491
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:08,708
[GLENN]
That freaking hurts!

492
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:13,166
[GLENN] The trick is to find
something you can care about

493
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:14,625
and just live for that.

494
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:16,708
Forget about the nature of life.

495
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:18,416
All that hippie crap's
just gonna strain

496
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,291
what little brains
you have left.

497
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:23,416
[RE=L]
Something I can care about?

498
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:29,375
[RE=L]
I'm sorry, my sisters.

499
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:32,416
I know it's a selfish choice,

500
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,416
but I'll live a life
for all of us.

501
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:38,208
[RE=L yelling]

502
00:21:49,666 --> 00:21:50,625
No, this can't be!

503
00:21:50,708 --> 00:21:51,791
Thunder emperor,

504
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:53,541
pierce with your
brilliant lance of light!

505
00:21:55,791 --> 00:21:57,291
Magic hour's over.

506
00:21:57,375 --> 00:21:59,125
Now it's time for The Fool.

507
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,416
Sorry for this, Rumia.

508
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,916
Just close your eyes.

509
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,083
It'll be done soon.

510
00:22:08,166 --> 00:22:09,333
[RUMIA]
That look...

511
00:22:09,416 --> 00:22:12,041
It's like when I first met him.

512
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:13,708
[RAINER]
Please, no...

513
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:14,625
Don't kill me.

514
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:16,250
[GLENN]
Say goodnight, mullet.

515
00:22:16,333 --> 00:22:18,166
[gun clicks]

516
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:20,041
[GLENN] Did you really think
I'd blow your brains out

517
00:22:20,125 --> 00:22:23,666
in front of two of
my own students?

518
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:25,500
Just stay away from my kids.

519
00:22:25,583 --> 00:22:27,333
Or I will end you!

520
00:22:34,041 --> 00:22:36,916
[BURKS (MONSTER) roaring]

521
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:37,916
[ALBERT]
Death to you.

522
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,041
Even last rites
shall be foregone.

523
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:43,666
Repent for eternity as you burn
in limbo's crimson flames.

524
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:45,375
[BURKS (MONSTER)]
I can't die!

525
00:22:45,458 --> 00:22:47,625
Heaven chose me!

526
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:55,833
[GROUP chattering]

527
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:57,083
[SISTINE]
Rumia!

528
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:05,583
Re=L!

529
00:23:05,666 --> 00:23:09,250
[crying]

530
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:16,833
[GIBUL] In theory,
you receive the ball

531
00:23:16,916 --> 00:23:18,625
based on its angle
to the ground.

532
00:23:18,708 --> 00:23:20,083
[yells]

533

[GROUP chattering]

534
00:23:22,166 --> 00:23:24,708
It really is a precious
sight, isn't it.

535
00:23:24,791 --> 00:23:25,583
Hell yeah.

536
00:23:25,666 --> 00:23:27,416
Look at all those swimsuits!

537
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,708
And volleyball has a
very high bounce factor!

538
00:23:29,791 --> 00:23:32,458
You know that's not
what I was talking about.

539
00:23:32,541 --> 00:23:33,416
This moment.

540
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,708
Their happiness.

541
00:23:34,791 --> 00:23:37,083
That's what you fought
so hard to protect.

542
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:37,958
Right, Glenn?

543
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:39,083
Who can say.

544
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:44,125
[ELEANOR]
Yes. I have it.

545
00:23:44,208 --> 00:23:48,041
The entire Project Revive
Life ritual is now ours.
