Her Majesty, the queen.

[ALBERT] We've received

within the Guard.

There's a chance some
of them may try something

27

against Her Majesty.

That's what our
leadership tells me.

30
00:01:17,791 --> 00:01:20,458

this Glenn matter alone?

It's about my next event.

You're doing

Yes.

I've been practicing
hard for it.

But I can't get the

for me, sir.

To start, let's review
Self Illusion.

00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:23,583
How would you
describe the spell?

74
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:27,166
It's black magic that cloaks
you in an illusion, sir.

75
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,333
[GLENN]
Exactly.

76
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:30,083
It's not some huge
spell that physically

77
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:33,000
reshapes your body--
it's just a trick.

78

Now behold.

Enacted by myself, I shall not
sing with another's voice.

There, you see?

82
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:46,500
It's really just a shell.

83
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:48,583
Then you can mold it
into whatever you want.

Amazing!

00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:51,333
My guess?

86
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:53,333
The spell isn't working 'cause
you're thinking too vaguely.

87
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:55,666
You need to imagine
every detail.

pull it off today,

you for hurting our team

there used to be.

323
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,791
Maybe a portrait
of someone special.

324
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,083
Someone precious.

325
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,875
Does that make me weird?

326
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:41,708
Wearing this every day
because of a picture

327
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:43,291
I just imagine is there?

328
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:44,541
Not really.

329
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:46,041
Like with spells,
it's about what the words

330
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:47,541
and tokens mean to you.

331
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:49,083
I'd say.

332
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:52,041
Professor, you know
the truth, don't you?

333
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:53,875
That Her Majesty and I...

334
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:55,416
Yeah.

335
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,125
Do you think I was wrong?

336
00:14:57,208 --> 00:14:59,875
The way I handled
that situation?

337
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:02,291
The truth is I understand
why she did it.

338
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:04,125
She had to.

339
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:06,583
I'm one of the gifted,
to put it kindly.

340
00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:08,625
Others would say
I'm the devil incarnate.

341
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:09,958
Or even cursed.

342
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:12,333
Because of this ability
I was born with,

343
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:14,416
I could become
a dangerous liability,

344
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,458
and rip the royal family apart.

345
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:20,041
So of course.
I know it was necessary.

346
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:21,625
The queen had to erase me.

347
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:23,875
She couldn't put
the empire at risk.

348
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:26,958
But even though it makes sense,

349
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:29,250
part of me can't
forgive what she did.

350
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:32,250
Part of me feels
so mad I could scream.

351
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:34,541
[GLENN] Can't apply logic
to matters of the heart.

352
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:36,083
[RUMIA] But another
part of me just wants

353
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:38,458
to call her "Mother"
one more time.

354
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:41,916
Wants to hug her,
and be hugged so tight.

355
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,333
But then...

356
00:15:43,416 --> 00:15:45,208
I think about Sisti's parents,
how they've taken me in

357
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:47,083
with no questions
asked and treated me

358
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:48,375
like their own.

359
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:50,958
And that makes me feel
like I'm betraying them.

360
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:53,708
I'm lost.
How do I reconcile all that?

361
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:57,166
Here's my philosophy.

362
00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:00,250
Human beings are regretful
by nature. Always.

363
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:03,083
Any choice we make comes
with pain no matter what.

364
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:06,125
[GLENN] It's easy to
say "pick carefully,"

365
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:08,250
so you won't have regrets.

366
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:10,125
That's a load of bull.

367
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:12,083
You agonize over
the path you choose,

368
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:14,291
but you'll always find
time to think of the turns

369
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:16,416
you didn't take.

370
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,333
It's the pain and the joy
of the human experience.

371
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:23,125
My advice?

372
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:25,000
Just make sure you're
being honest with yourself.

373
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:26,041
Honest?

374
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:27,458
Yeah.

375
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:29,333
'Cause the closer you can
get to your true feelings,

376
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:31,958
the less those regrets down
the line are gonna hurt.

377
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:35,750
Rumia.

378
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:38,125
What do you want most of all?

379
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:39,333
That's just it.

380
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:41,625
Right now I'm not sure
what I'm feeling.

381
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:45,166
A long time ago,

382
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:48,625
I served in the
Imperial Army as a mage.

383
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:50,166
Due to the nature
of my assignments,

384
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:52,625
I visited the court
pretty often.

385
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:55,083
Every time I went, I would
see the most powerful person

386
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:56,583
in the kingdom wearing a locket

387
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:59,291
just like the one you're
holding in your hand.

388
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:01,000
She may have erased
you from the books,

389
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:02,583
but not from her heart.

390
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:04,208
So does that locket
have meaning?

391
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:05,708
Hell yeah, it does.

392
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:08,125
Even if it's just to
unload your resentment.

393
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:09,958
Start by confronting her.

394
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:12,083
Tell the queen all those
feelings you told me about

395
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:13,750
instead of running away from it.

396
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:15,750
You think so?

397
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:17,333
'Course.

398
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:19,291
I'm hardly the person to talk
after all the running I've done.

399
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:23,041
But... I'm scared.

400
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,458
Her eyes can turn so cold,

401
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:26,666
and I'm not sure
I could handle that.

402
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,583
Do you think you could...

403
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:34,000
Do you think you could go
with me, Professor Radars?

404
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:37,416
Damn it.

405
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,291
All right.

406
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:39,333
I'm such a softy.

407
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:41,166
Great! I can't thank you enough!

408
00:17:44,291 --> 00:17:46,000
[GLENN]
Speaking of the Guard.

409
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:52,125
[SOLDIER 5A]
Are you Rumia Tingel?

410
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:53,541
Yes, that's right

411
00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:57,750
I hereby declare...

412
00:17:57,833 --> 00:18:00,041
You are accused of
conspiracy to assassinate

413
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:01,416
Queen Alicia the Seventh!

414
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,791
And found guilty!

415
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:04,250
You will be executed immediately

416
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,750
for this heinous treason
against the Crown!

417
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:08,125
[RUMIA]
What? Me?

418
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:10,000
Assassinate the Queen?

419
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:11,791
Is this some
crappy performance art?

420
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:12,875
Where's your proof?

421
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:15,041
It's not your
business, outsider.

422
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:16,666
You're going to execute
her with no warrant

423
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:17,708
and no trial?

424
00:18:17,791 --> 00:18:18,583
[SOLDIER 5A]
Yes.

425
00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:20,166
By direct order of Her Majesty.

426
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:22,333
Cut the crap!

427
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:23,708
Step away from her, fool!

428
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:25,250
If you continue to defend her,

429
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:27,750
then you'll be executed
for treason, as well.

430
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:31,041
[RUMIA]
I surrender.

431
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:32,125
Are you nuts?

432
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:33,541
I'm the queen's subject.

433
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:36,083
If Her Majesty accuses
me of betraying her,

434
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:38,625
then it's my duty to pay
for that sin with my life.

435
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:40,625
But please.
Don't hurt my professor.

436
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:42,125
Shut up! What are you do--

437
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:44,708
Professor!

438
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:45,833
[SOLDIER 5A]
Let's go.

439
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:56,875
Close your eyes and don't move,
for your own sake.

440
00:18:56,958 --> 00:19:00,291
If I miss your heart, it will
only prolong your suffering.

441
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:01,416
Yes.

442
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:04,500
[RUMIA] I always thought
this would happen.

443
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,083
That one day she'd
decide to finish the job,

444
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:09,583
and take my life.

445
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:13,333
[RUMIA]
Of course.

446
00:19:13,416 --> 00:19:15,583
That's why she came to see me.

447
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:18,000
To say goodbye.

448
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:20,041
I was supposed to die that day,

449
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:22,333
but I was given
three more years,

450
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:25,000
and created so many
wonderful memories.

451
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:29,458
[RUMIA]
Don't be sad. Be grateful.

452
00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:31,083
[GLENN]
Keep those eyes shut, okay?

453
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:35,250
[SOLDIERS grunt]

454
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:36,458
[SOLDIER 5C]
I'm blind!

455
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:45,583
[GLENN] Aw, jeez, sword
hilts are a bitch.

456
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:46,375
[RUMIA]
Professor!

457
00:19:46,458 --> 00:19:47,500
What have you done?

458
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:49,375
What? It's just a
Flash a Light spell.

459
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:51,083
They're blind, not dead.

460
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:53,500
But why?!
Why did you rescue me?

461
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:55,958
Well, if I hadn't, white cat
would've yelled my ears off.

462
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:57,250
[RUMIA]
This isn't funny!

463
00:19:57,333 --> 00:19:59,125
Now they're gonna
convict you, too!

464
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:01,375
I had to. I promised.

465
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:04,250
Well, relax we'll
straighten this out.

466
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:06,125
The queen would never have
ordered your execution,

467
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:07,833
let alone without a trial!

468
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:09,500
There's no way that makes sense.

469
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:10,708
I don't know what's going on,

470
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:12,833
but there's a bigger
knot to untie.

471
00:20:12,916 --> 00:20:14,625
We just need to figure
out how to talk to her.

472
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:15,875
[SOLDIER 5D]
Over there!

473
00:20:15,958 --> 00:20:17,833
You're going to be
sorry, traitors!

474
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:19,458
Professor, what are
we going to do now?

475
00:20:19,541 --> 00:20:21,500
Now we freaking run!

476
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:24,250
Great rule of time.
Balance of the scales.

477
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:26,750
Let the plate of
order tip portside.

478
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:31,375
[SOLDIER 5D]
Don't let those rebels escape!

479
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:33,583
[GLENN] Why do I keep
getting crap thrown at me?

480
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:35,791
People love to make fun
of the unemployed shut-ins,

481
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:38,208
but dudes don't run
after them with swords!

482
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:40,208
--[RUMIA] What's your plan?
--[GLENN] Excellent question!

483
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:41,791
How can we slip
past the Imperial Guard,

484
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:44,208
but still get face time
with the Queen?

485
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:45,416
Wait...

486
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,416
It doesn't have to be
our faces, does it?

487
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:50,083
I think it's time to grow
this supposed conspiracy.

488
00:20:57,541 --> 00:20:58,291
[CELICA]
Glenn?

489
00:20:58,375 --> 00:20:59,458
Yeah, hey, Celica.

490
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:01,500
You're sitting with
Her Majesty, right?

491
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:02,708
I need help, okay?

492
00:21:02,791 --> 00:21:03,875
[CELICA]
I can't help you.

493
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:07,000
Excuse me? I haven't asked yet!

494
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:08,541
You don't have to.

495
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:10,750
Now listen to me carefully.

496
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:12,250
I can't help you.

497
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:15,750
And I can't say anything more,
do you understand?

498
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:18,083
Don't suppose I'm lucky
and you're joking?

499
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:19,125
[CELICA]
No.

500
00:21:19,208 --> 00:21:20,500
[GLENN]
And our situation?

501
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:22,250
[CELICA]
I have a rough idea.

502
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:25,250
So is this some kind of
mutiny by the Imperial Guard?

503
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:29,125
Or does Her Majesty
actually want Rumia dead?

504
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:30,791
Let me guess, you can't say.

505
00:21:30,875 --> 00:21:32,791
[CELICA]
No. You're on your own.

506
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:34,166
[GLENN]
What?

507
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:36,708
Whatever happens next
is up to you and you alone.

508
00:21:36,791 --> 00:21:39,416
Please, take those
words to heart.

509
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,208
Find some way
to do what's right,

510
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:43,666
and present yourself
to the queen.

511
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:44,916
Hey, wait!

512
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:45,916
Damn it.

513
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,125
Professor?

514
00:21:47,208 --> 00:21:49,500
[GLENN] What was that,
some kind of riddle?

515
00:21:49,583 --> 00:21:51,208
Present myself to the queen?

516
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:53,458
She's surrounded by
highly-trained soldiers.

517
00:21:53,541 --> 00:21:55,541
Not to mention Commander Zelos.

518
00:21:55,625 --> 00:21:56,750
Gimme a break.

519
00:21:56,833 --> 00:21:59,458
This is obviously way
above my pay grade.

520
00:21:59,541 --> 00:22:01,000
How do I do this?

521
00:22:11,791 --> 00:22:12,833
It's you?!
