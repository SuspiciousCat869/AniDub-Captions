[BURKS] White alchemy is a

than life itself.

00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:51,708
[SISTINE]
Hm?

72
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:52,833
Well, it...

73

if it's really okay

to delve too deep into this...

they're doing that kind
of research here.

But one thing
I don't understand.

91
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:38,250
In all our classes,

92
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:39,708
we're taught that
resurrecting the dead

93
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:41,125
is theoretically impossible.

94
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:42,708
Precisely.

95
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:45,666
At the moment, no magic exists
that can disprove that axiom.

96
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:48,083
That's actually the very
reason why they founded

97
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:49,500
Project Revive Life.

98
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:51,750
[GLENN] They figured they
needed three ingredients.

99
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:53,208
A body created
through alchemy

100
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:54,958
using the dead guy's
genetic code,

101
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:57,500
which they cleverly
called a "Gene Code,"

102
00:05:57,583 --> 00:05:59,416
an Astral Code,
which is just memories

103
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,208
transformed into data,

104
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:04,666
and Alter Ether,
which resets a person's spirit.

105
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:08,000
Those elements are
combined to revive someone.

106

I appreciate the explanation,

109
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:13,791
but did you have
to butt in like that?

110
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:15,291
Oh, sorry 'bout that.

111
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,708
I just knew something
and wanted to prove it.

112
00:06:17,791 --> 00:06:20,500
Essentially the idea is to
fuse together these elements

113
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:22,791
to create a facsimile
of the deceased.

114
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:24,458
Yeah, but in that case,

115
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:26,708
is it really even
a resurrection?

116
00:06:26,791 --> 00:06:29,416
Indeed, that might not
be the best term for it.

117
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,250
More accurately,
it's creating a duplicate

118
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:33,500
of who they were
shortly before death.

119
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:35,916
[GLENN]
Relax.

120

multiple chumps had to die

123

just to revive one person.

124
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:45,750
The lucky stiff, if you will.

125
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:49,083
That kinda trade-off
wasn't exactly sustainable.

126
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:52,083
Yes, too true.

127
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:54,166
We humans are not
meant to be gods.

128

Nothing gives us
the right to decide

129
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:57,625
who should live
and who should die.

130

to remain sealed away

134

Oh, come on,
you don't believe that.

It's just an urban legend.

Um, this is just
out of curiosity,

138
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:20,333
but aside from the
three elements

139
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:21,958
Professor Radars mentioned,

140
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:23,541
is there anything else
you can think of

141
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:26,041
that might be needed
to get Project Revive Life

to work?

143
00:07:28,416 --> 00:07:30,458

comes to mind is

144
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:32,666
original magic.

145
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:35,458
If there was somebody who
possessed the original magic

146
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:39,000
necessary to Project
Revive Life, then maybe.

147
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:43,666
[SISTINE] But what are the odds
of someone showing up like that?

148
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:46,166
I mean they have to be
incredibly small, right?

149
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:48,666
[BURKS laughs]
That they are.

150
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:49,833
Regardless, the point is

151
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:52,291
successfully completing
that project

152
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:55,916

makes the impossible possible.

It's their fault!

It's all their fault!

168
00:08:57,833 --> 00:09:02,625
They're the ones--who took
Glenn away from me.

Why, Glenn?

[GLENN]
Re=L is basically just a child.

175
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,125
Sure, she looks the
same age as you guys,

176
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:45,500
but mentally,
she's like a little girl.

177
00:09:45,583 --> 00:09:46,791
And not the
brightest one, either.

178
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:48,750
We're talking the kind
that eats paint.

179
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:51,208
It's not her fault.
It's just the way she was born.

180
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,791
Anyway, hope you won't
lose patience with her

181
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:57,125

Believe me.

I know how tempting that'll be.

184

What? Don't be ridiculous!

185
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:05,875
Professor we would
never just abandon Re=L.

All right, I'm going to go
out there and look for Re=L!

187
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:17,750
Nah, you girls should
wait for her here

in case she comes back.

189

[RUMIA, SISTINE gasp]

191

[GLENN] Don't worry,
I'll go look for Re=L.

192
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:29,041
I am her teacher.
So I kinda have to.

Oh, I'm hurt.

You don't recognize
your big brother?

Is that you?

Wait, but how?

At last.

201

I've missed you so much.

00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:03,333
[ALBERT]
Tsk. So that's the play?

203
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:11,833
[ALBERT]
A barrier to keep others out?

204

You work fast, don't you?

205
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:17,083
Or perhaps I was
just overly careless.

206
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:21,416
[ELEANOR laughs] Aw, are you
out here all alone tonight?

Poor boy.

You excited to see me?

00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:31,375
Perhaps I could impose
on you to entertain me

212
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:33,041
for the night, Albert?

213
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:36,083
I promise to give
you one hell of a time,

214

fueled with a passion
so shameless and unbridled

215
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:41,458
it will make you scream
so loud you raise the dead.

216
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:42,750
[ALBERT]
Unfortunately for you,

217
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:44,750
I have no interest
in cheap women.

218

So get lost.

[ELEANOR laughs]
What a cold man you are.

I'm sure you're still
acting out some vile scheme

involving the princess

I'm removing you from the board.

No need for such haste.

Ah, let me guess.

You thought that you
would have an easy time

besting me in close magic combat
simply because I'm a sniper.

Oh, not at all.

It's just, you're so much
stronger and virile

Oh, Albert, you're
driving me... crazy!

Your super regeneration--

It's not a conditional

of any drugs accelerating
your own healing factor.

on a whole different level

than any of the evil mages
I've eliminated before.

I don't really know why, but...

But, at the time,
you must've been so upset,

you didn't notice that
I was still breathing.

[RAINER]
Re=L, please save me.

287
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:13,458
Two years ago,
you managed to defect

and earn your own
freedom from them.

But meanwhile, I still
remain as their slave.

00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:22,833
But... How can I do
anything to save you?

[RE=L gasps]

293
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:27,500
[RAINER] The organization
needs her for the plan

they have in motion right now.

295

Which means that mage, Glenn,

is a pretty big
obstacle for them.

The organization's
given me a chance.

If I can make this plan work...

00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:53,458
Thank you for everything.

324
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:54,625
Goodbye, Glenn.

325
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:03,208
I had to.

326
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:05,375
I have to live for
my brother's sake.

327
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:20,416
Pathetic!

328
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,708
Aw, sad!

329
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:23,958
Time to go.

330
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:25,000
Fire!

331
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:35,500
She got me good that time,
I'll admit it.

332
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:39,958
Oh, well.

333
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,583
I may have bought too much.

334
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:46,875
Though Professor Radars
does eat a lot.

335
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:54,666
Uh, Rumia?

336
00:18:07,541 --> 00:18:10,083
Re=L? What have--

337
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:12,416
What have you done to her?

338
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,500
--[SISTINE] Rumia!
--[RE=L] Just relax.

339
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:16,583
I didn't kill her,
so don't panic.

340
00:18:16,666 --> 00:18:18,708
She's just unconscious.

341
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:20,208
Wait a second.

342
00:18:20,291 --> 00:18:22,416
[gasps] Hey, where is he?

343
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,333
The professor went
looking for you!

344
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:26,833
Oh, Glenn?

345
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:29,958
Yeah, I did kill him.

346
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:43,791
[SISTINE]
No. No way.

347
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:45,541
It can't be...

348
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,625
I don't understand.

349
00:18:47,708 --> 00:18:48,958
Why would you do this?!

350
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:51,083
[RE=L]
'Cause I'm with the, um...

351
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:53,583
The Researchers of, um...

352
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:55,375
Oh, what was it again?

353
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:58,458
Anyway, I'm your enemy now.

354
00:18:58,541 --> 00:19:00,375
And I'm taking Rumia with me.

355
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:04,333
[SISTINE]
Hold it right there!

356
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:07,583
You get away from her!

357
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:09,833
Do you hear me?

358
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:12,083
If you make a move, I'll shoot.

359
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:15,875
I said don't move!

360
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:17,291
Oh, will you?

361
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,208
Will you really do it?

362
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:27,291
[RE=L]
Go ahead.

363
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:30,750
I won't do anything to you.

364
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:34,333
[RE=L]
Shoot.

365
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:36,000
Bang. You're the opposite.

366
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:37,958
You act tough,
but you're just a child,

367
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:39,958
hiding your weakness
behind a mask.

368
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:41,500
Somebody help me!

369
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:42,583
[RE=L]
Shoot.

370
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:47,666
[RUMIA] I understand your point
about magic causing damage.

371
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:50,000
And make it truly
helpful to people.

372
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:51,875
[GLENN] If you're serious
about protecting Rumia,

373
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:53,583
this magic is your best bet.

374
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:56,291
Military-anything
isn't exactly cuddly.

375
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:59,041
But there's no way its
dark side is getting to you.

376
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:11,458
Your time is up.

377
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:21,125
[SISTINE]
How could I?

378
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:22,833
I had no choice.

379
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:26,083
If I'd fired,

380
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:29,083
I might have accidentally
hit Rumia, too.

381
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:31,083
And then there's Re=L.

382
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:32,625
She could've died.

383
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:34,125
At my hand.

384
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:39,041
[SISTINE]
No, that's not it.

385
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:43,458
I was just so scared,
I couldn't do anything.

386
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:45,625
[sobbing]

387
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:46,875
Professor...

388
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:50,000
[SISTINE gasps]

389
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:51,541
[ALBERT]
Sorry to barge in.

390
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,833
[SISTINE]
Mr... Frazer?

391
00:20:58,666 --> 00:21:00,000
[SISTINE screams]

392
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:01,250
Professor Radars!

393
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:03,291
[ALBERT] Don't panic.
He's still breathing.

394
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:05,000
[SISTINE] He needs healing
magic right away!

395
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:06,250
Won't work.

396
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:08,875
He's already on the edge
of the reaper's scythe.

397
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:10,583
No, he...

398
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:13,250
Professor! Professor!

399
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:15,750
I need you to
share your strength.

400
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:18,250
What could you possibly
expect me to do?

401
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:20,250
If healing magic
won't work on him,

402
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:22,000
I can't help!

403
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:22,916
No!

404
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,500
No, no!

405
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:26,208
Why did this have to happen?

406
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:27,625
[crying]

407
00:21:27,708 --> 00:21:29,500
Pull yourself together.

408
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:34,458
All this whining and self-pity
won't do anything to save him.

409
00:21:34,541 --> 00:21:39,000
If you want to kill this man,
then by all means, keep crying.

410
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:40,875
Leave the rest
to the undertaker.

411
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,666
Wait, please don't go.

412
00:21:49,958 --> 00:21:51,541
Just tell me.

413
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:53,416
What do you want me to do?

414
00:21:55,916 --> 00:21:58,041
[SISTINE]
The white magic ritual, Reviver?

415
00:21:58,125 --> 00:22:01,208
But doesn't that require an
enormous amount of mana?

416
00:22:01,291 --> 00:22:02,541
Exactly.

417
00:22:02,625 --> 00:22:06,250
That's why I'll be
using your mana, too.

418
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:07,333
Understood.

419
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:11,416
I'll handle the ritual's
complicated setup process.

420
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,916
You work the shortened,
temporary servant pact.

421
00:22:16,958 --> 00:22:18,833
[ALBERT] He stopped
breathing. What a baby.

422
00:22:18,916 --> 00:22:19,666
[SISTINE]
Huh?!

423
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:21,166
What? Professor?!

424
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:22,250
[ALBERT]
Calm down.

425
00:22:22,333 --> 00:22:24,833
It's only his
breathing that stopped.

426
00:22:24,916 --> 00:22:26,916
He still has a faint pulse.

427
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,125
Fibel, administer CPR
until the ritual's ready.

428
00:22:30,208 --> 00:22:31,708
[SISTINE gasps]
CPR?

429
00:22:31,791 --> 00:22:34,000
[ALBERT] If you're an academy
student, you should know how.

430
00:22:36,583 --> 00:22:38,125
Yeah, but truth is,

431
00:22:38,208 --> 00:22:39,875
I've never actually
performed it on--

432
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:41,208
Shut up and do it!

433
00:22:41,291 --> 00:22:43,291
You don't have
time to be scared!

434
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:14,791
[RAINER]
Ah, you're awake now!

435
00:23:14,875 --> 00:23:16,916
Sorry 'bout the rough treatment.

436
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,458
But we needed to get you
here, no matter what it took.

437
00:23:20,541 --> 00:23:23,083
For our sake, as siblings.
Right, sis?

438
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,750
Wait, Re=L?

439
00:23:26,833 --> 00:23:28,583
Why on earth are you doing this?

440
00:23:28,666 --> 00:23:30,125
Where's Professor Radars?

441
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:32,208
Oh, he won't be
coming to save you.

442
00:23:32,291 --> 00:23:34,666
Re=L murdered him in cold blood.

443
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:35,875
[RUMIA gasps]

444
00:23:35,958 --> 00:23:37,208
He's lying.

445
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:38,375
Re=L.

446
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:40,625
You would never do that!

447
00:23:40,708 --> 00:23:42,208
Would you, Re=L?

448
00:23:42,291 --> 00:23:43,625
Tell me the truth!

449
00:23:48,291 --> 00:23:49,250
[RE=L]
Sorry.
