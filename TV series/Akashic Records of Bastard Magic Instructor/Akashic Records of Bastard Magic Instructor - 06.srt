00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:10,416
for a total of 37 points!

162
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,791
Has he just run away with this?

163
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:14,958
No. How can I top that?

164
00:08:16,541 --> 00:08:20,041
Oh, Mr. Frazer, sir.

165
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:21,708
[ALBERT] Looks like you've
been putting a lot of work

166
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:23,791
into your image training.

167
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:25,041
So you should relax now.

168
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:26,625
And have fun
at this competition.

169
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:28,166
That's the point.

170
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:29,958
And besides, if anybody
tries to blame you

171
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:31,625
for our class losing,

172
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:32,833
then I'll give them
a big helping

173
00:08:32,916 --> 00:08:34,833
of my iron fist.

174
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:37,583
[LYNN] That's exactly what
the professor said to me.

175
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,041
Good?

176
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:41,625
Yeah.

177
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:44,916
Next, we've got Lynn,
representing class two!

178
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,625
What transformation
is she going to attempt?

179
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:51,791
Now behold, phantasmagoria.

180
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:53,500
Enacted by myself.

181
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:55,166
This is for you, Professor!

182
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,500
[CROWD cheering]

183
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:04,791
[ARS]
An angel!

184
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:07,250
No doubt about it,
that's La Tilika,

185
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:10,625
like she jumped out of an icon
and straight into your hearts!

186
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:12,791
Ten, ten, ten, and ten!

187
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:15,833
A perfect score!
She's beaten Seta!

188
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:18,541
Looks like class two has
found their groove again!

189
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:22,625
[ARS] That's it for
the Granzia event!

190
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:24,875
Class two storms back
with a conditional spell

191
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:27,583
and claims the win
with fantastic teamwork!

192
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:29,375
Not too bad. Right, sir?

193
00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:30,833
[ARS]
With that score, class two

194
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:32,750
has caught up with class one!

195
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:34,541
Incredibly,
this year's competition

196
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:37,166
is heading into the final
event in a dead heat!

197
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:40,708
Whoever wins these magic
duels is going to win it all!

198
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:46,708
[VELOS]
You haven't captured them yet?

199
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:48,208
No, Commander.

200
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:51,125
That magic instructor is aiding
the traitor's escape, sir.

201
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:54,041
[VELOS] You're using one
mage as your excuse?

202
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:57,583
You will find this
Rumia Tingel without fail.

203
00:09:57,666 --> 00:09:59,458
And you will kill her.

204
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:02,833
[ARS] This duel's middle
bout has been intense,

205
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:04,750
with neither side ceding ground.

206
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:05,875
But wait!

207
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:07,458
The earth elemental
Gibul has summoned

208
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:09,250
has captured Kreiss,
and I'm not seeing

209
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:10,625
a counterspell!

210
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:12,375
I give up!

211
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:14,125
[ARS]
Kreiss admits defeat!

212
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:15,833
After Kash's loss
in the first round,

213
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:17,958
Gibul recovers with
a hard-fought victory,

214
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:20,708
and evens the score at one-one!

215
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:23,000
Nice! You just saved
our butts, Gibul!

216
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:25,708
[GIBUL]
Was there ever a doubt?

217
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:28,000
[ARS] And that brings us to
the final round, boys and girls!

218
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:31,500
Heinkel from class one
versus Sistine from class two,

219
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:34,541
with the match and the
overall title on the line!

220
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:36,375
It's about time I get to fight.

221
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:37,291
Hear the crowd?

222
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:38,416
I warmed them up.

223
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,416
Try not to waste that, Sistine.

224
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,875
Real motivational, Gibul.

225
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:43,291
Thanks for the support.

226
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:45,083
"If you win, we'll have a party.

227
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:48,041
I'll let you pig out on all the
food and drink you want."

228
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:49,833
Glenn told me to say that, too.

229
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:52,958
So, go on. Kick butt.

230
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:55,041
Yeah. You can count on me.

231

[SOLDIER 6B]
There they are!

232
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:02,833
[ARS]
Sistine is literally blown away

233
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:05,458
by Heinkel's
overwhelming Fire Wall!

234

[HALLEY]
Don't stop, Heinkel! Finish her!

235
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:08,500
Right.

[WENDY]
Hang in there, Sistine!

237

Think about the party!

00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:14,916
We'll eat ourselves sick
on the professor's tab!

Don't be idiots. Win this.

Trust us, Sisti.

241
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:22,750
[SISTINE]
Do they think I don't know?

242
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:23,916
I'm no idiot!

243
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:26,916
Keep them all at bay.

Grant peace to them below!

[HEINKEL]
She trapped me with wind!

247
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:36,875
What spell did she cast?

248
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:38,458
It's called Storm Wall.

249
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:40,791
She's using an altered spell?
Thunder sprites--

250
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:41,791
Too slow!

251
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:43,291
Pay heed, great wind!

[ARS]
And it's over!

254
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:53,541
Sistine's Gale Blow has
thrown Heinkel out of bounds,

making class two the victors!

With those final points,

It's over.

Huh?

the queen herself.

How dare you.

You're one to talk.

Commander Mutiny.

293
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,916
Sorry to interrupt
the party, Queen Alicia,

294
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,666
but your Imperial
Guard's been using

295
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:27,250
your good name to try
to kill an innocent girl.

296
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:29,166
Shut your mouth, vile traitor.

297
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:31,583
But luckily, you've had me
keeping Rumia safe.

298
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:34,416
And now the Guard's
outside this barrier.

299
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,625
So we're good!

300
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:37,708
Just order your men
to stop, Your Majesty.

301
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:39,375
And no one gets hurt.

302
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:41,833
That girl must die.

303
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:43,083
For what?

304
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:44,250
When this is over,

305
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:47,041
I'll take responsibility
for my failure.

306
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:48,750
And end my own life.

307
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:51,250
But I've sworn a vow.

308
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:54,166
To ensure the queen's
survival above all else.

309
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,500
It is my duty,
and Her Majesty's,

310
00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:58,625
to preserve her life
for the sake of the empire,

311
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:00,958
no matter the sacrifice!

312
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:02,458
There's no time, my queen.

313
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:04,458
You must think
about your people

314
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:06,000
and make a decision.

315
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:11,291
This is my command.

316
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:17,416
You will put that girl,
Rumia Tingel, to the sword.

317
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,833
What?!

318
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:19,958
Forgive my bluntness,

319
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:22,666
but I cannot allow
that child to exist.

320
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:24,583
I wish she never had.

321
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:27,583
I have never loved her,
not one single day.

322
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:30,875
The only thing I regret
is giving birth to her at all.

323
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:33,166
If that is not true, nothing is.

324
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:35,250
I don't get this!
What the hell are you saying?

325
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:36,833
I know those are lies!

326
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:37,958
[RUMIA]
So that's it?

327
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:41,541
Is that all you have
to say to me?

328
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:44,583
Yes.

329
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:45,666
[RUMIA gasps]

330
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:49,000
[VELOS]
Thank you.

331
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:51,000
For your quick judgment,
my queen.

332
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,083
Celica! What is this?

333
00:14:56,416 --> 00:14:58,666
[GLENN] Damn it!
This wasn't supposed to happen!

334
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,916
I thought getting here
was the answer!

335
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
What am I freaking missing?

336
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:05,875
[ALICIA] I figured she
wouldn't accept me.

337
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:07,791
Why would she
view me as her mother?

338
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:16,625
[GLENN] The queen doesn't
have to justify an execution.

339
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:18,041
Even if she thought
it was necessary

340
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:20,583
to protect the crown,
why would she say those lies?

341
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:21,916
What was the point?

342
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:29,833
[GLENN] Unless she wanted
me to catch the lie?

343
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:31,166
[CELICA]
I can't help you.

344
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:33,750
And I can't say anything more,
do you understand?

345
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:37,000
Whatever happens next
is up to you and you alone.

346
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:38,125
Could it be...?

347
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:41,458
[GLENN]
Your Majesty.

348
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:42,750
That's some necklace.

349
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:44,583
I couldn't help but notice it!

350
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:48,625
Why, thank you.

351
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:51,333
It's new, yet very
significant to me.

352
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:52,916
With a rock like that, I'm sure.

353
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,250
Wow!

354
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:56,458
But with all those karats,
it's gotta be heavy!

355
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:58,625
Why don't you take it off
and rest your shoulders?

356
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:00,083
Certainly not.

357
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:02,208
That's the last thing
I would want to do.

358
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:04,791
You don't say.

359
00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:07,500
[VELOS]
Not another word, sorcerer.

360
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:08,541
[GLENN]
Rumia.

361
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:12,583
You can save the
tears for another time.

362
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:14,416
Your mom really does love you.

363
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:16,958
Get back!

364
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:20,333
[GLENN yells]

365
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:21,375
Professor!

366

[CELICA gasps]

367
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:24,625
Die!

368
00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:26,208
No!

369
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:37,083
[VELOS]
My queen! What have you done?

370
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:38,541
[GLENN yells]

371
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:49,291
[GLENN]
A conditional-cursed necklace.

372
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:50,833
I love being right.

373
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:54,375
[GLENN]
Remove it and the wearer dies.

374
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:56,500
Time limit passes, wearer dies.

375
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:58,416
If anyone near it
explains the curse,

376
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,666
you guessed it, deadzo!

377
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,458
A classic ploy that's
been so overused

378
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:04,166
it's almost lame!

379
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:05,666
The only way to lift the
curse...

380
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:09,625
[GLENN]
Rumia had to die. Am I right?

381
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:13,833
I knew you'd solve it. There.

382
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:15,458
And did you know I was
gonna get a sword stuck

383
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:16,666
through my hand too?

384
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:17,833
Not cool.

385
00:17:17,916 --> 00:17:20,333
Wait. But why didn't
the curse activate?

386
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:25,916
[VELOS]
The Fool Arcana?

387
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,291
What?

388
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:29,208
You mean you used that spell
to seal off the magic

389
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:30,625
that was in the necklace?

390
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:32,333
I had no idea.

391
00:17:32,416 --> 00:17:33,666
[GLENN chuckles]

392
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,208
Now. Your Grace.

393
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:36,875
You can stop with the lies.

394
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:38,583
Huh? Lies?

395
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:42,083
[GLENN] She took a
big risk talking to us.

396
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:44,708
If she'd slipped up the curse
would've killed her.

397
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:47,416
Those lies were like
a riddle, a secret message,

398
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,208
helping me figure out the truth.

399
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:52,375
[ALICIA]
I'm so sorry, Ermiana.

400
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:54,458
I've done it again.
I've hurt you.

401
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:57,750
My queen?

402
00:17:57,833 --> 00:18:00,583
I'm so glad.
I'm so glad you're safe.

403
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:05,375
[crying]

404
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:06,708
It's okay, Mom.

[BOTH crying]

00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:14,750
[GUARDS gasp]

407
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:17,833
[SOLDIER 6F]
Her Majesty is safe!

408
00:18:27,416 --> 00:18:30,625
The truth is that our superiors
assigned us two missions.

409
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:32,708
First, to monitor
the Imperial Guard,

410
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:35,541
which has lately shown
extremist tendencies.

411
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:37,708
Second, to the investigate
the backgrounds

412
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:40,166
of those closest to the queen.

413
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:41,583
Eleanor Chalet,

414
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:44,541
heretic mage with the
Researchers of Divine Wisdom.

415
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:48,083
You tried to orchestrate
the former princess's demise.

416
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:49,750
My question's why.

417
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:51,791
It seems the empire
isn't completely made up

418
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:53,208
of fools, after all.

419
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:56,958
Akashic Records, that's why.

420
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:00,583
Let's just say this.

421
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:02,333
That's what the princess is for.

422
00:19:02,416 --> 00:19:03,458
You won't escape!

423
00:19:12,041 --> 00:19:14,583
[GLENN]
Her handmaid, huh? Holy hell.

424
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:17,166
[ALBERT] Just proves how deep
the Researchers of Divine Wisdom

425
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:20,083
have burrowed into
the empire's core.

426
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:23,333
So you think there's
bound to be others, right?

427
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:24,791
[ALBERT]
We need to get back immediately

428
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:26,166
and plan countermeasures.

429
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:27,875
You be careful, too.

430
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:28,916
[GLENN chuckles]

431
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,458
Thanks for the
help today, Albert.

432
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:31,875
You're a real gem.

433
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:33,208
You too, Re=L.

434
00:19:33,291 --> 00:19:35,625
Glenn. Next time
we'll settle things.

435
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:37,250
Right.

436
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:38,458
That a threat?!

437
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:41,333
[RUMIA]
Professor?

438
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:44,333
[GLENN]
How'd it go?

439
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:51,541
[CELICA]
Sure you can't stay?

440
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:53,708
[ALICIA]
Yes. But all is well.

441
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:56,375
I feel she was able to get
everything off her chest.

442
00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:59,083
[ALICIA] I truly can't
thank you enough, Celica.

443
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:00,375
With you and
your apprentice here,

444
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:02,333
I know this is
the best place for her.

445
00:20:02,416 --> 00:20:04,833
Please keep her safe.
And happy.

446
00:20:04,916 --> 00:20:05,875
Sure.

447
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:08,375
That's what Glenn does best.

448
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:09,625
[RUMIA]
You were right.

449
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,875
I feel so much better
after talking to her.

450
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:14,375
That's yet another
thing I owe you for.

451
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:16,750
All I did was run around
and get stabbed.

452
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:20,500
Professor, how did
you figure it out?

453
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:22,291
That she was lying, I mean.

454
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:27,125
Three years ago...

455
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:29,708
Back when you were
abducted by those mages,

456
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:31,583
the queen asked me for help.

457
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:33,583
[ALICIA]
Please, I'm begging you, Glenn.

458
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:35,666
I know I shouldn't be
asking you to risk your life

459
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:38,458
on a rescue that
may be impossible.

460
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:40,833
But I... I just have to!

461
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:44,375
Please, Glenn,
she's everything to me!

462
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:47,250
The tears she cried,
you just can't fake.

463
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:49,750
I see. I wish I had known that.

464
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:53,083
So... You keep making
good on your promise.

465
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:55,625
I wasn't sure you
remembered it was me.

466
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:57,625
[GLENN]
There's still some bad guys.

467
00:20:57,708 --> 00:20:59,583
So you can be as frightened
of me as you want,

468
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:02,458
but if you'll just stop crying,
then I can try to save you.

469
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:06,916
[RUMIA]
You said you were on my side.

470
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,583
Before you left, you promised
you always would be.

471
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:13,916
And you're still helping me,
some three years later.

472
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,208
A promise is
a promise, after all.

473
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:20,166
You know... All things
considered, I'm pretty lucky.

474
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:22,791
Both you and my mother
have saved me.

475
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:26,166
It all evens out,
'cause your class saved me.

476
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:28,166
Now I won the prize money
and three months salary

477
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:30,250
from Halbert, or whatever.

478
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:32,750
They deserve to
have a little party.

479
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:36,000
[STUDENTS]

00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:41,791
[laughs]

483
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:43,666
Sisti, are you okay?

484
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,708
Yeah, she just had
too much brandy cake.

485
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:47,916
I think we all did, actually.

486
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,208
Hi, Professor.

487
00:21:49,291 --> 00:21:51,041
Were you out helping Rumia?

488
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:53,291
You're always
taking care of her.

489
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:55,125
You're sweet when
you aren't a jerk!

490
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:56,500
[laughing]

491
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:58,250
Okay, white cat, that's enough.

492
00:21:58,333 --> 00:21:59,541
I'm not catnip!

493
00:22:02,791 --> 00:22:04,041
They just blew
the reward money

494
00:22:04,125 --> 00:22:06,750
and three months salary
on one stupid dinner?!

495
00:22:10,041 --> 00:22:11,583
[GLENN]
Okay, class, line up!

496
00:22:11,666 --> 00:22:14,666
I've got an Extinction Ray
for every one of you ingrates!

497
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:18,833
