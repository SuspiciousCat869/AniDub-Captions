Up until recently,
most attack spells

00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:52,291
employed by the
Imperial military

226
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:53,833
were one of three types.

227

Heat, cold, or shock.

228
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:58,375
I hope now, with this
elegant formula in mind,

229
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:00,666
you can understand why.

230
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,333
Take Shock Bolt, for example.

231
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:04,041
It's perhaps our
most basic spell.

232

Yet if you can
apply these lessons,

you can increase its
output significantly.

Since wind spells

they have less military use.

00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:41,125
Holy crap!

326
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:43,875
Rumia, I take it back,
this is a great show!

327

[RUMIA groans]

328
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:46,625
You're worried.

329
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:48,000
What's wrong?

330
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:49,750
I can't put my finger on it.

331
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:51,458
I just have a bad feeling.

332
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:52,500
Oh, I get it.

333
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:54,375
Like women's intuition, right?

334
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:55,750
We'll talk about that later.

335
00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:58,541
But first let's
enjoy the drama!

336
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:01,000
Um, Leos...

337
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:03,458
I care about you,
but I'm afraid my answer

338
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:04,833
has to be no.

339
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:05,875
What?

340
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:06,958
Uh...

341
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:08,250
And why not?

342
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:11,541
I promised my grandfather
to solve the mystery

343
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:14,041
of Melgalius's Sky Castle.

344
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:17,125
To do that, I've got a lot
more to learn about magic,

345
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:19,458
and I can't afford
to be pulled two ways.

346
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:20,208
I'm sorry.

347
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:22,000
[laughs]

348
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:23,916
You haven't changed at all.

349
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,458
I can't believe
you're still focusing

350
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:27,166
on that ridiculous fantasy.

351
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:28,666
[SISTINE gasps]

352
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,375
Magic archeology.

353
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:32,916
The exploration of
ancient ruins and artifacts,

354
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,750
with the ultimate goal
of unraveling the mysteries

355
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:37,250
of past civilizations
and recreating spells

356
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:39,541
forgotten by time.

357
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:40,666
It's an alluring idea,

358
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,875
but no one has
ever accomplished it,

359
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:45,916
and the Sky Castle is
the most opaque of all.

360
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,416
Devoting your talents
to the same fool's errand

361
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:51,708
would be a meaningless,
tragic squandering.

362
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:53,625
A fool's errand?

363
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:55,375
Your grandfather was brilliant.

364
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:57,625
If he hadn't been
obsessed with that castle

365
00:15:57,708 --> 00:15:59,541
imagine how much more
he could have contributed

366
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,000
to a useful field.

367
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:03,666
Please, Sistine.

368
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:06,250
Listen to reason
and join me in my work.

369
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:08,083
With your assistance
we could revolutionize

I'm sorry, Leos.

You're a great mage and
you have wonderful dreams.

373
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:19,333
But so do I and
I won't give them up.

374
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:21,083
I want you to have dreams.

375
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:23,333
I simply don't want you
to waste your life.

Stop trying to tear
her down, you shitbag!

your nose in again?

I beg your pardon, colleague,

She fell and fell hard.

In fact she just fell into my
bed last night--it was hot.

Anyone who truly
cares about Sistine

see the truth

before it's too late.

You're not fit
to be with this lady.

And yet somehow I'm the one
she's actually picked.

making an enemy out of me.

You'd be bad news for her.

I guess we have
to make this official.

What's that mean?

I'll get hitched to white cat,

spend the rest of my days

as a shut-in who
never wears pants!

right back in the deep end.

487
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:31,625
So, I came to tell you
not to get involved.

488
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:36,583
[ALBERT] Honestly, hearing
that it's being used again

489
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:39,000
makes me wonder if
Sara died for nothing.

490
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:42,541
I'm not gonna let that
happen again, Albert.

491
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:44,000
Not this time.

492
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:45,416
This time?

493
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,625
Wow.

494
00:20:46,708 --> 00:20:47,750
[chuckles]

495
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:48,958
I was right.

496
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:51,166
You do see Sara in that girl.

497
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,416
[GLENN]
Shut up.

498
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:04,333
[SARA]
Don't be embarrassed, Glenn.

499
00:21:04,416 --> 00:21:05,375
I like it.

500
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:07,375
I think it's a beautiful dream.

501
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:13,000
[SARA] A mage of justice,
always coming to the rescue.

502
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:15,750
I often wish there were
someone like that in the world.

503
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:18,958
You should take
pride in that dream,

504
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:20,500
and cling to it.

505
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:21,958
That's what I think.

506
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:24,250
[GLENN] All right, white dog,
don't make it a thing.

507
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:25,583
[SARA laughs]

508
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:26,791
Given the job we do,

509
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:29,833
who wouldn't welcome
a hero in their corner?

510
00:21:29,916 --> 00:21:32,500
You're fine, Sara,
don't worry about a thing.

511
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:33,833
I'll always protect--

512
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:36,375
[GLENN] W-Wait.
Is that not what you...?

513
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:39,375
[SARA] Finish!
What were you about to say?

514
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:41,750
[GLENN] Nothing,
I said nothing, forget it!

515
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:56,041
[JATICE]
How did it play out, Leos?

516
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:58,375
Exactly the way you predicted.

517
00:21:58,458 --> 00:22:00,375
[JATICE chuckles]

518
00:22:00,458 --> 00:22:01,458
I mean, really.

519
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:03,041
It was most uncanny.

520
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:06,166
Right after I proposed,
Glenn challenged me to a duel.

521
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:08,500
I'm starting to think
you're some kind of prophet.

522
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:11,250
[JATICE]
I just know people.

523
00:22:11,333 --> 00:22:12,541
Leos.

524
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:15,208
Dance your best
against Glenn for me.

525
00:22:15,291 --> 00:22:18,458
You will be laying down
the foundation of my justice.
