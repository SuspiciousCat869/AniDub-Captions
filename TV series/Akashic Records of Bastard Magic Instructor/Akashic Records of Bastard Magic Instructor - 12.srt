Hey, did you hear?

About Sistine?

Yeah, the ceremony's next week.

That's awfully soon, isn't it?

16
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,750
[GIBUL] I thought that
they were already engaged.

17
00:01:08,833 --> 00:01:10,916
So why is everybody
making a fuss now?

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,375
Honestly...

19
00:01:12,458 --> 00:01:14,500
I'm more interested in finding
out why Professor Radars

20
00:01:14,583 --> 00:01:16,416
never showed up for that duel.

Sistine! Is it true?

Yes.

Oh, that.

That was just a dream.

[RUMIA]
Please, be patient.

00:02:19,208 --> 00:02:22,208
I'm sure Professor Radars
will think of something.

45
00:02:22,291 --> 00:02:23,791
But Glenn is gone.

Who knows where he is...
or if he'll be back.

I tried to ask Sisti about it

48
00:02:30,833 --> 00:02:32,958
when she came home that night,

49
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:36,166
but all she would say is
that she's marrying Leos.

50
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:38,375
[SISTINE]
Just leave me alone, okay?

Professor, if we don't
do something, Sisti will...

55
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:56,583
[RUMIA] I told Professor
Radars everything I knew--

56
00:02:56,666 --> 00:02:58,500
everything that had happened.

57
00:02:58,583 --> 00:02:59,583
And then...

58
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:03,291
I've got this.

59
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:06,458
[RUMIA] Right after that,
he went to Re=L

60
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:09,208
and told her that
she should stay with me.

61
00:03:09,291 --> 00:03:11,416
Then he just disappeared.

62
00:03:13,708 --> 00:03:15,125
[RUMIA]
It'll be all right.

63
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:17,208
He assured me that
he had it all covered,

64
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:19,583
so have faith and
just wait for him.

All right, let's go!

Okay!

166
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:57,875
Well, men?

167
00:07:57,958 --> 00:07:59,208
Let's do this.

168
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:00,291
Right!

[ADDICTS groaning]

170
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,166
Don't move!

Damn it!

172
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:08,916
They got us trapped.

173
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,166
But why?

174
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:12,333
What's wrong with these people?

175
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:13,833
[GLENN] At this point,
they're basically just

blindly following
their master's orders.

But never mind that. Go!

00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:21,291
Just get outta here!

I can't deal with these

Oh, don't you worry about me!

I can take care of myself,

Damn it!

00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:21,750
I can't help but think we're
just being herded by Leos.

204
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:24,458
Is he trying to
ensnare white cat?

205
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:26,041

I can't let him do it!

If I half-ass it this time,
I'll lose her again.

Get away from me!

Sorry.

00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,916
You can drop the Leos disguise!

229
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,208
Well done.

230
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:42,916
I thought you might figure
out my true identity

231
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,708
sooner or later.

232
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:46,500
That man isn't Leos.

233
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:48,416
He's former Imperial
Court Mage Corps

234
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:53,125
Executioner Number Eleven,
Justice, Jatice Lowfan.

235
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:54,666
You look surprised.

236
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:57,000
Didn't think I was
still alive, did ya?

237
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:02,375
Wait. Where is Leos?

238
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:03,375
Tell me!

239
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:05,416
Oh, that pompous little turd?

240
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,000
I gave him my drug so
he would do my bidding,

241
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:10,458
but the weakling had
to go and die on me.

242
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:12,375
What a drag.

243
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:13,541
If I'm being honest,

244
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:15,250
he was pretty much
a dead man already

245
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:18,000
once I gave him
the Angel's Dust.

246
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:20,625
That was right after the
Mage Corps Battle ended,

247
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:22,875
if I'm not mistaken.

[SISTINE]
No...

249
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,291
It's been a while,
hasn't it, Glenn?

250
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:28,791
You have no idea
how long I've waited,

251
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:31,416
eagerly wanting to
spar with you again.

252
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,791
White cat, get away from here.

253
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:35,041
Huh?

254
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:37,500
This isn't a world you
should be any part of.

255
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:40,625
I agree, now go and
make yourself scarce.

256
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:42,291
Your role in this
production has reached

257
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:43,541
its conclusion.

258
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:45,375
If you attempt to
interfere in my battle

259
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:48,041
with Glenn... I'll kill you.

[SISTINE gasps]

261
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,083
[GLENN]
You heard him.

262
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:52,166
Go!

263
00:11:58,291 --> 00:11:59,500
Take care now.

264
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:02,250
[JATICE]
You know, she really does bear

265
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:04,833
an uncanny resemblance to Sara.

266
00:12:04,916 --> 00:12:07,083
[GLENN]
Shut the hell up!

267
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:08,958
So you established
contact with Leos,

268
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:10,208
arranged our duel,

269
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:12,791
and even planned a damn
wedding, all for what?

270
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:15,458
To orchestrate this battle
between me and you?

271
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:16,416
[JATICE chuckles]

272
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,750
That's right.

273
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:20,333
[GLENN] Well, guess I fell
for your original magic,

274
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:23,458
with its ability to predict
how events will play out.

275
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:25,375
So, what's your goal here?

276
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:28,250
Precisely the same
as it was a year ago.

277
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:30,166
To exact justice.

278
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,416
You just use
justice as an excuse,

279
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,750
so you can go around murdering

280
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:35,500
all the powerful mages
of the army,

281
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:37,958
not to mention important
figures in the empire!

282
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:39,541
[JATICE]
That about sums it up.

283
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:41,000
Though you left out
the part where you

284
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:43,250
interrupted me midway through.

285
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:45,916
But this time, all will
go according to plan

286
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,666
once I obtain the
Akashic Records!

287
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,583
Akashic Records?

288
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:51,583
[JATICE]
Yes.

289
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:52,833
Containing the power
to rule over

290
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:55,166
the very principles
of this world!

291
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:57,583
And I will have
it all to myself!

292
00:12:57,666 --> 00:12:59,583
But its power can
only be held by one

293
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:01,541
who is absolutely just.

294
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:03,666
And therefore,
I shall have no right

295
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:06,208
to posses it until
I've defeated you,

296
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:08,250
who thwarted my justice.

297
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:10,208
Even if it were allowed somehow,

298
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:12,625
I would never abide
such a thing!

299
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:14,750
This is not my
revenge against you!

300
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:17,041
No, it is my challenge to you!

301
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:19,375
I will be a mage of justice,

302
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:21,791
and as such,
render judgment upon

303
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:23,916
all the evil in this world!

304
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:29,916
[GLENN] As if that kinda
justice actually exists!

305
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:34,000
I should've known it was you
as soon as you pulled out

306
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:35,833
those tulpas the other night!

307
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:44,333
[SISTINE] All this time,
I thought that Professor Radars

308
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:46,500
didn't belong in our world.

309
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:49,833
So I rejected him.

310
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:52,041
But, over and over again,

311
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:55,041
the professor has risked
his life to protect ours.

312
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:58,583
I've been a fool.

313
00:13:58,666 --> 00:14:00,291
I've pushed him away.

314
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:01,583
[crying]

315
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:03,416
At this point, he's probably
going to leave us

316
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,375
and go somewhere far away,

317
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:08,958
but what can I do about
it in my condition?

318
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:10,291
What should I do?

319
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,583
[JATICE]
No use hiding from me, Glenn.

320
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:16,333
I'm just getting
started here!

321
00:14:16,416 --> 00:14:18,791
[GLENN] Great rule of time,
balance of the scales.

322
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:21,041
Let the plate of
order tip portside.

323
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:30,250
Silver ice wolf,
race forth, clad in blizzard!

324
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:31,625
How you like this?

325
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:39,333
[JATICE laughs]
You're as resourceful as ever.

[JATICE laughs]

327
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:48,458
Yes, now that's
what I want to see!

328
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:49,583
Shut up!

329
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:51,708
I can barely hear
myself killing you!

330
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:58,375
[GLENN grunts]

331
00:14:58,458 --> 00:15:00,375
[JATICE]
Ah, it seems I've won,

332
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:01,875
but don't worry, Glenn,

333
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:04,208
as a sign of merciful
respect I promise

334
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:08,416
to make your death as quick
and painless as possible.

335
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,666
Please do give
my regards to Sara

336
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,250
in the other world.

337
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:25,416
[SISTINE]
I made it in time.

338
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:29,083
[GLENN]
White cat! You...

339
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:32,125
You moron!

340
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:33,500
Why'd you come back?

341
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:36,041
I told you, you don't
belong in this world!

342
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:40,208
[SISTINE] That's right, and
you don't belong in it either.

343
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:42,250
I came for a reason.

344
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:43,875
To bring you back!

345
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,750
Remember you told me

346
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:50,583
if I want to protect her

347
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:53,416
that I'd have to be stronger.

348
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:56,166
Well, Rumia is
irreplaceable to me,

349
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:58,833
but now, so are you!

350
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:03,583
[SISTINE] When you're scary
and when you're being a loser.

351
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:05,666
They're both part
of who you are,

352
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:08,041
and nobody could
ever replace you!

353
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:15,125
So stay!

354
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:17,500
Stay by our sides
and keep fighting!

355
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:19,375
Don't you dare leave us!

356
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:27,541
[JATICE]
My goodness.

357
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:32,083
You certainly caught
me off guard there.

358
00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:36,541
[SISTINE] Listen, just leave
Professor Radars alone!

359
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:37,916
[JATICE]
My, you're a pest.

360
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,166
Even your personality
resembles that brat Sara's.

361
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:47,458
Ain't that a bitch.
I must be losing my edge.

362
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:49,500
Don't need this
straightjacket anymore.

363
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:53,708
Hey, white cat, two-man cell.

364
00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:56,166
I'll be in front,
you take the rear.

365
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:57,250
Got it?

366
00:16:58,083 --> 00:16:59,583
[GLENN]
Here's the deal.

367
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:01,750
I will destroy this jerk, even
if it means going down with him,

368
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:03,166
but no matter what,
I'll make sure you get

369
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:05,291
outta this in one piece.
So just... 

370
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:07,916
[SISTINE] Sorry, but I
don't accept those terms.

371
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,083
Now, if you agree that we'll
both make it home safely,

372
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:14,250
then you've got yourself a deal,
all right, Professor?

373
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:16,916
I guess I can do that.
Thanks, Sistine.

374
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,166
Well, I'm shocked.

375
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:20,500
So you do know my
real name after all.

376
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:23,125
Today's full of surprises.

00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,458
Go time!

[JATICE] What a nuisance
you are... Sistine Fibel!

00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:28,833
Enough of your meddling!

and fire through!

to interfere in my fight

wind, form twofold,

[JATICE growls]
Curse her!

00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:11,333
I didn't expect the
girl to be so skilled.

392
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:14,208
A grave miscalculation
on my part.

sleeping in my depths!

Eliminate those villains
who bare their fangs

Don't get cocky, Glenn.

00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:34,625
It was two against one,
you needed her.

But what a pity,
she can't help you now.

[JATICE]
Still, in honor of her efforts,

I can be a good sport
and admit defeat for today.

[GLENN]
You all right?

00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:55,000
[JATICE] You may not
realize it yet, Glenn...

417
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:58,833
...but this empire
needs to be destroyed.

418

Because the awful truth is

this entire nation was
founded with the evilest

of intentions.

421
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:07,416
May we meet again soon, Glenn.

422
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:11,000
Next time, my justice will
surely triumph over you.

Oh stuff it!

here again, you creep!

I can move at all.

Hey, you sure you're comfortable
having a degenerate

00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:44,500
like me as your teacher?

439

Don't be stupid.

440
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:47,875
The fact that I'm
still here by your side

441
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:50,416
right now should be all
the answer that you need.

Don't you think, Professor?

443
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:07,250
[GLENN] Sorry I let Jatice
just slip away like that.

444
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:08,916
No need to apologize.

445
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Especially since I didn't
ask you to help us with that.

446
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:13,083
That psycho.

all kinds of crazy,

messed-up nonsense...

449
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:19,000
But there was one thing
that perked my ears.

450
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:21,041
[JATICE] The Akashic
Records contain the power

451
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:23,708
to rule over the very
principles of this world!

452
00:21:23,791 --> 00:21:27,833
And I will soon have
it all to myself!

453
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:29,375
[GLENN] Seemed like
he was pretty desperate

454
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:32,291
to get his hands on that.

455
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:34,541
[ALBERT]
The Akashic Records, huh?

456
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:35,875
Interesting.

457
00:21:41,625 --> 00:21:43,625
[ELEANOR]
So deep in here.

458
00:21:43,708 --> 00:21:45,666
Is the door to be opened?

459
00:21:46,791 --> 00:21:48,750
[laughing]

460
00:21:56,166 --> 00:21:58,291
Morning, starshine!

461
00:21:58,375 --> 00:22:01,041
Nice weather we're havin',
eh, Professor Halloween?

462
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:02,291
It's pronounced "Halley"!

You're doing that on
purpose now, aren't you?

I'll have you know, sir,

467
00:22:09,291 --> 00:22:11,125
halitosis is a serious
medical condition

468
00:22:11,208 --> 00:22:12,708
with a painful stigma...

more like a real teacher

00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:23,750
Would be a breeze
if I just tried a little.

474

[CELICA]
Good.

00:22:25,041 --> 00:22:26,916
Then I don't have to
worry about you anymore.

of the underground labyrinth.

I haven't been able
to shake the feeling

479
00:22:32,541 --> 00:22:33,708
that there's some important work

that I need to be
doing down there.

"And the Demon Lord asked,

487
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:52,791
'What are you?

488
00:22:52,875 --> 00:22:55,083
What drives you to such lengths?

489
00:22:55,166 --> 00:22:57,250
How are you capable of all this?

490
00:22:57,333 --> 00:22:59,458
I can't fathom why you'd risk,

491
00:22:59,541 --> 00:23:01,375
and endure, so much.'

492
00:23:02,916 --> 00:23:06,041
Without hesitation
the mage answered,

00:23:06,125 --> 00:23:07,833

'That's simple, Demon Lord.

494
00:23:07,916 --> 00:23:10,416
There are things
I wish to protect.

495
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:13,083
Things I must protect.

496
00:23:13,166 --> 00:23:16,916
It is this conviction, and
understanding of my duties,

497
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,958
that causes infinite
power to spring

498
00:23:19,041 --> 00:23:20,916
from my depths.

499
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
And lets me rise again.'" 

500
00:23:25,583 --> 00:23:27,916
Yep, I rise again.

501
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:38,958

Hello, kiddoes.

502
00:23:39,041 --> 00:23:40,500
Settle in.

503
00:23:40,583 --> 00:23:42,583
'Cause class is in session!

504
00:23:44,958 --> 00:23:46,041
[ALL]
Yes, sir!
