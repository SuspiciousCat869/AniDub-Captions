159
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,000
[sobs]

160
00:08:58,916 --> 00:08:59,791
[YUU]
Tama!

161
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:01,208
[KOYUKI gasps]

162
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:04,291
Hey, Nico.

163
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:06,500
I've been waiting for you!
Come with me!

164
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:08,125
Come on, hurry!
We gotta go fast!

165
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:10,583
Where the heck're
you taking me?

166
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:16,250
There wasn't enough
for an igloo, but, look!

167
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:20,541
[gasps] You built snowmen!

168
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:21,958
[YUU]
Just like we promised.

169
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:25,916
[KOYUKI giggles]
You remembered every word, huh?

170
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:30,375
Sure, I did! I like it when
I get to make you smile.

171
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:31,625
[gasps]

172
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,791
[YUU]
Uh...

173
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:47,208
[YUU]
Uh, what'd I say?

174
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:06,958
[KOYUKI] I'm really sorry
that I can't say goodbye.

175
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:13,458
I feel like if I saw you,
all I'd do is cry again.

176
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:19,291
[KOYUKI] I promise. I'll do
my best to get stronger.

177
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:24,708
That way, I'll always be able
to smile, no matter what.

178
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:36,916
[KOYUKI] It's time for me
to stop being afraid.

179
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:47,375
[KOYUKI] So, the next time
I see Nico, I can tell him.

180
00:10:58,375 --> 00:10:59,458
[KOYUKI]
Yamada.

181
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:01,375
So the Christmas concert
that's coming up.

182
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:02,750
I need one of the tickets.

183
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:04,833
What? If there's someone
you want to invite,

184
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:05,833
just let me know.

185
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:08,166
No, I've got to do
this in person.

186
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,166
[KOYUKI grunts]

187
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:22,750
[doorbell rings]

188
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:27,166
Not home.

189
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:31,833
[gasps]

190
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:37,333
[YUU]
Excuse me.

191
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:38,833
[KOYUKI gasps] Oh, gosh.
I swear, I'm not a stalker!

192
00:11:38,916 --> 00:11:39,916
Tama! Hey!

193
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
[giggles]

194
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:49,250
Uh, I'm really sorry.
No one else is around today.

195
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:50,583
No, it's fine.

196
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:52,666
I should apologize to you
for randomly showing up!

197
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:55,583
Nah, really, no worries at all!

198
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:57,083
Okay.

199
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:02,083
[KOYUKI]
Just give him the ticket

200
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:05,541
and apologize for
the other night.

201
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:08,166
You have to make
things right with him!

202
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:11,916
[KOYUKI]
Um... Here.

203
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,041
[YUU]
Mm... Uh...

204
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:18,416
I have a concert coming up
in Yokohama next month.

205
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,291
I was hoping you might
be able to make it out

206
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:21,666
if you aren't busy.

207
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:24,083
Uh, you were?

208
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:26,250
I'm so sorry about last time.

209
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:29,208
I was just taken
off guard, you know?

210
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:31,083
And then I was worried
that you might hate me now,

211
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:33,083
so I was afraid to
even email you.

212
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:34,458
[gasps]

213
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:36,875
But I couldn't stand to
leave things like that.

214
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:39,166
So I worked up the courage
to come here again.

215
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:41,791
I feel exactly the same!
I've been terrified

216
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:43,916
to message you because
I thought you hated me!

217
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,333
[KOYUKI gasps]

218
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:50,500
You know, you could've
just come out and said so!

219
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:52,666
I've been super stressed
about all this!

220
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:56,916
Well, I was really upset, too!
My bad, you're right.

221
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,375
Some things never change.

222
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:01,750
I can't believe you still mope,
just like you used to.

223
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:03,458
Okay, that's harsh.

224
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:06,166
[KOYUKI exhales]

225
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:07,666
[YUU groans]

226
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:12,541
Are you coming to
the concert, or not?

227
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,916
I swear I'll be there.

228
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,125
Okay. Then, I guess
I forgive you.

229
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:20,333
Good, I'm so glad.

230
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:27,083
[giggles]

231
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:32,125
[YUU] It's amazing, you know.
I can't believe you've had

232
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:34,458
so many big concerts
booked in one year!

233
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:36,875
And those aren't easy
set lists, either!

234
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:39,416
It's a pretty long show
and I have a new song!

235
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,958
Yeah? I can't wait to hear it!

236
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:42,541
You're in luck!
As a matter of fact...

237
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:44,083
[YUU gasps]
Oh, that reminds me!

238
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:46,375
My band's gonna be
playing a concert, too!

239
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:47,750
At the school fair!

240
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:50,916
Yeah? That's so cool.

241
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,583
Yep. I've been practicing a ton,

242
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,666
but I'm still worried
I'm gonna screw it up.

243
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:58,666
[KOYUKI] With that same girl
you were with at the beach?

244
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,833
Uh-huh. She's kinda nuts.

245
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:02,625
I think you'd like her
if you got to know her.

246
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:05,291
She's super impulsive and does
crazy things like gathering

247
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:07,291
a bunch of newbs
together to be in a band,

248
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:08,833
which is pretty absurd.

249
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:11,583
But she's also loads of fun
to be around most of the time.

250
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:13,375
And she's got an
incredible voice!

251
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:15,166
You should hear her!

252
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:17,625
We ended up performing at
a beach house over summer break,

253
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:19,791
and she sang "Climbers High"
by the Hedgehogs!

254
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:21,291
She totally knocked
it outta the park!

255
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:22,666
I get it!

256
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:23,958
[YUU]
Uh...

257
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:27,333
Sorry, she sounds great!

258
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:30,791
But, it's just that I-- I didn't
realize how late it was,

259
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:33,291
so I have to get
back to work now!

260
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:39,375
Good to see you.
Sorry I intruded.

261
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:41,375
Well, intrude longer next time.

262
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:44,416
I know my sisters
are dying to see you.

263
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,250
Deal.

264
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:48,958
Anyway, I'm just
really relieved.

265
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:50,333
Now we can be friends again!

266
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:52,000
[gasps]

267
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:56,291
You okay?

268
00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:01,250
[KOYUKI]
I was just thinking...

269
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:03,708
Could we renew our
promise from before?

270
00:15:03,791 --> 00:15:04,916
Uh...

271
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,708
Oh, come on, you couldn't
have forgotten.

272
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:09,875
We promised we'd perform
on the same stage!

273
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:16,500
Sure. We can do that.

274
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:20,125
We will do it!
Hey, pinky swear!

275
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:22,958
Right! It's a promise.

276
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:37,875
See you later, Nico!

277
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:39,416
[YUU]
See ya!

278
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:55,125
Does he feel the same way?
I can't tell.

279
00:15:58,291 --> 00:15:59,833
[KOYUKI gasps]

280
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:05,750
[FUUKA] Stop! Wait!
Look what you did, you jerk!

281
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:09,708
[FUUKA]
Hey, are you okay?

282
00:16:09,791 --> 00:16:12,416
Sometimes, I think they
actually try to do that.

283
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,166
Akitsuki, right?

284
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:17,250
[FUUKA gasps]
What the--? Koyuki?

285
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:19,041
That's me.

286
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:31,333
[FUUKA] If you want, I can
wash these dirty clothes

287
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:32,208
before you go.

288
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:35,125
Okay. Thank you, Akitsuki.

289
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:37,958
Oh, call me Fuuka!
I live just upstairs.

290
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:39,083
The bath's aren't open yet,

291
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:40,958
but feel free to use
'em if you want,

292
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:43,416
since you'd have the
whole place to yourself!

293
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,291
[FUUKA giggles]

294
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:48,333
What am I even doing here?
Good grief.

295
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:49,833
[FUUKA]
I can't believe it!

296
00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:51,458
What on earth brought
you over here?

297
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:54,500
Jeez, you poor thing!
Your clothes are soaked!

298
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:56,541
[KOYUKI grunts]
It's fine!

299
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:58,291
I can grab a taxi
home to change!

300
00:16:58,375 --> 00:16:59,500
[FUUKA]
Nope! This way!

301
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:02,000
[KOYUKI gasps]

302
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:04,333
Um. Where're you taking me?

303
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:06,541
You'll see! Just come on!

304
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:22,375
Mind if I get in with--
Wait a minute!

305
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:23,750
[KOYUKI]
Huh?

306
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:25,000
[FUUKA] Sorry but you
can't actually take a towel

307
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:26,208
in the bath with you!

308
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:28,291
What? But, I thought
people always did that

309
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:29,541
at the Hot Springs resorts.

310
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:31,625
No, no, no!
That's just on TV!

311
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:34,916
Uh, right, of course.
I'm sorry about that.

312
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,333
Never been to one of these,
as you can tell.

313
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:40,875
Oh, well that explains a lot.
Then I hope you will allow me,

314
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:42,416
your friendly
bathhouse professional,

315
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,833
to instruct you in some
useful bathhouse etiquette!

316
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:50,708
[FUUKA] You've always gotta
wash off before you get in.

317
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:52,958
So many people use
these public baths,

318
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:54,666
so we've hafta keep 'em clean.

319
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:57,666
Thanks but, I can
probably wash myself.

320
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:01,125
No, it's my pleasure. Think of
it as a special service!

321
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,708
You know, I've gotta tell you.

322
00:18:05,791 --> 00:18:07,250
I think you've got
the perfect hair!

323
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:09,375
Uh? You do?

324
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:11,541
Yeah. I'm jealous!

325
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:13,541
Well, thanks, but I could
say the same thing to you

326
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:15,583
about your beautiful skin!

327
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
[KOYUKI]
'Bout the same.

328
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:22,166
What? You okay?

329
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:24,500
[KOYUKI] O-Oh, yeah!
Yeah! I'm just fine!

330
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:25,750
[FUUKA]
Hm?

331
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:34,250
Hey, Akitsuki.

332
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:36,625
I told you, Fuuka's fine.

333
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:38,625
Fuuka, then...

334
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:39,666
Yeah?

335
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,416
Thank you for
washing my clothes.

336
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,625
And for the bath.

337
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:44,125
You don't have to thank me!

338
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:45,958
I mean, I've always
wished I could somehow

339
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:47,208
get to know you, so...

340
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:48,750
Uh, why's that?

341
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:52,208
Because I'm your biggest fan!
Your last CD was so amazing!

342
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:54,666
Omigosh! Could you please sign
it for me before you go?

343
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:55,916
I will love you forever!

344
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,541
Sure! Yeah. I'd be happy to.

345
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:02,000
Wa-hoo! I just love
your music so much.

346
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:04,083
Most of your lyrics make me cry!

347
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:06,625
[KOYUKI chuckles nervously]
Thanks, I think!

348
00:19:06,708 --> 00:19:09,958
So, tell me. How do you write
songs that are so powerful?

349
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:12,333
Um, what exactly
are you asking?

350
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:14,250
The secret to writing
a great song!

351
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:15,583
You see, I'm in a band.

352
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:17,583
And I want to start writing
some original music

353
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:18,958
for us to play together.

354
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:21,500
So, I'd love to hear all
about your writing method!

355
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:23,375
[KOYUKI]
Uh...

356
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:25,583
My band's gonna play
a concert, too!

357
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:28,958
At the school fair!

358
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:32,416
I don't really see how my music
could be of much help to you.

359
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,041
I don't have a band.

360
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:35,541
What?

361
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:38,125
No, but I wanna write songs
that move people like yours.

362
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:40,458
Honestly, I think something
a little more cheerful and fun

363
00:19:40,541 --> 00:19:41,875
would suit you better!

364
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:45,166
'Cause, I mean, my songs
are about unrequited love.

365
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:48,458
What a drag. And about
how nothing I do pays off.

366
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:50,166
That is not true!

367
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:51,875
Uh...

368
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:54,833
[FUUKA sighs]

369
00:19:54,916 --> 00:20:00,333
Ah! Your songs are just so...
how do I put it?

370
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:02,791
It's like your whole
heart's in every word.

371
00:20:02,875 --> 00:20:05,000
What do you mean,
my whole heart?

372
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:06,750
[FUUKA sighs]
Every part of you.

373
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:08,333
The good stuff and the bad.

374
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:11,750
You're a human doing her
best to love no matter what.

375
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:14,916
That's what I like most
about the things you write.

376
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,666
[KOYUKI]
I see.

377
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:19,208
I never thought you were
saying nothing you did paid off.

378
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:22,291
Your songs are...
really optimistic.

379
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:25,375
To me, for what it's worth.

380
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:27,291
Thanks, Fuuka.

381
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:28,541
So, you see?

382
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:30,500
That's why I want you to
teach me how you do it.

383
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:31,750
So I can write songs

384
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:34,375
that make people feel
how I do about yours!

385
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:35,958
Okay.

386
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:45,208
Back when I was little, I liked
this boy and he's never been

387
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:49,541
far from my mind since then.
He inspires most of my songs.

388
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:54,250
Your feelings are still that
strong for him? Even now?

389
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:56,541
It's one-sided, but yes.

390
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:59,125
I guess I write songs
as a way to express it.

391
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:01,291
I've never actually
told him how I feel.

392
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:03,000
That makes total sense.

393
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:05,291
It's no wonder there's so
much yearning and emotion

394
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:06,833
in your lyrics.

395
00:21:06,916 --> 00:21:09,500
Anyway, that's how I do it.
I don't know if that helps you.

396
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:11,708
[FUUKA sighs]

397
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:15,208
Do you have anyone in your
life who you like that way?

398
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:19,000
Huh? Who, me? Nope, not-a-one.

399
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:22,166
A relationship has never
really been on my radar.

400
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:24,416
Oh, I see.
Thank goodness for that.

401
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,458
[FUUKA]
Huh?

402
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:27,750
Uh, it was dumb! Never mind!

403
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:29,750
[FUUKA]
Know what, Koyuki?

404
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:32,166
Listen, I'm rooting
for your love, okay?

405
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:33,666
Huh?

406
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:36,041
I want you to be happy and
all your dreams to come true!

407
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:38,166
And maybe if I
really support you,

408
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:39,333
somewhere along the way,

409
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:41,458
I'll learn what it's
like to be in love!

410
00:21:41,541 --> 00:21:44,041
[FUUKA] So, what's a practical
way that I can help you out?

411
00:21:44,125 --> 00:21:47,541
[FUUKA gasps] I know! We can go
to that shrine right over there.

412
00:21:47,625 --> 00:21:49,750
My parents went there
once to make a wish!

413
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:51,416
Uh! Hey, your towel!

414
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,416
[FUUKA]
Huh?

415
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,833
[KOYUKI gasps]

416
00:21:54,916 --> 00:21:58,500
[FUUKA, KOYUKI giggle nervously]

417
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:06,916
Come by again some time!

418
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,541
Sure. Thanks for today, Fuuka.

419
00:22:11,625 --> 00:22:13,166
[FUUKA]
See ya soon!

420
00:22:16,666 --> 00:22:18,791
[KOYUKI chuckles]

421
00:22:21,875 --> 00:22:23,166
[KOYUKI]
Mm.

422
00:22:30,375 --> 00:22:36,958
<i>It was you I always loved</i>

423
00:22:37,041 --> 00:22:42,541
<i>Always you who held my heart</i>

424
00:22:42,625 --> 00:22:44,791
<i>I see your tears</i>

425
00:22:44,875 --> 00:22:49,291
<i>As snow melts into fireworks</i>

426
00:22:49,375 --> 00:22:54,500
<i>And I give you all of me</i>

427
00:22:54,583 --> 00:23:00,541
<i>I don't regret one day with you</i>

428
00:23:00,625 --> 00:23:07,291
<i>The greatest love I ever knew</i>

429
00:23:07,375 --> 00:23:10,333
<i>You and I can laugh at anything</i>

430
00:23:10,416 --> 00:23:13,375
<i>Unafraid of what</i>
<i>the future brings</i>

431
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:19,333
<i>Now our time has passed but</i>
<i>I don't want to say goodbye</i>

432
00:23:19,416 --> 00:23:22,250
<i>I want to believe we</i>
<i>were meant to be</i>

433
00:23:22,333 --> 00:23:24,000
<i>But we lost somehow</i>

434
00:23:24,083 --> 00:23:30,208
<i>I realize that now</i>

435
00:23:30,291 --> 00:23:36,833
<i>It was you I always loved</i>

436
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:42,583
<i>Always you who held my heart</i>

437
00:23:42,666 --> 00:23:44,750
<i>I feel my tears</i>

438
00:23:44,833 --> 00:23:49,333
<i>As snow melts into fireworks</i>

439
00:23:49,416 --> 00:23:56,625
<i>'Cause I gave you all of me</i>

440
00:24:01,083 --> 00:24:04,000
Hey, check it out, man.
I got this amazing shot today!

441
00:24:04,083 --> 00:24:06,375
[GUY B]
Huh? Is that for real?

442
00:24:06,458 --> 00:24:08,125
[GUY A]
Think I should post it?

443
00:24:13,875 --> 00:24:15,833
[FUUKA]
Next time, "Blown Up!"
