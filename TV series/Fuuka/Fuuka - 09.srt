00:07:58,541 --> 00:07:59,541
See ya!

162
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:00,916
[YUU] 
Bye!

163
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:04,333
[KOYUKI] 
Uh, Nico!

164
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:05,375
[YUU]
Uh?

165
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,958
Next time, you get to pick
the place where we hang out!

166
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:11,541
So, start thinking!

167
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:12,958
I will!

168
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:28,875
This is bad. I'm gonna be late.

169
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:35,791
I'd better get ready,
she's gonna be pissed.

170
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:37,166
Though, in my defense,

171
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,958
she should really get
a freakin' cell phone.

172
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,125
Sorry I'm so late!

173
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:47,333
[panting]

174
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:49,291
No, no, we love sitting around.

175
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:50,708
[YUU]
I'm really sorry!

176
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:51,958
I guess you couldn't help it

177
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:54,333
if you were on a date
with your girlfriend.

178
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:56,208
Keep that in mind when
it happens to me.

179
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:58,083
Not that you even
have a girlfriend.

180
00:08:58,166 --> 00:08:59,250
Shut up, you!

181
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:01,000
You were so late,
 we were worried.

182
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:02,750
Thought you might've
gotten into some mischief

183
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,166
and something bad happened.

184
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:06,666
You little pervert! What kind
of mischief did you--

185
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,291
[yells]

186
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:10,791
[NACHI groaning]

187
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,833
I apologize.
It won't happen again.

188
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:17,208
Well, now that everyone's
finally made it,

189
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:18,666
I think we should get started.

190
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:19,791
[YUU]
Uh.

191
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:21,000
 What's wrong?

192
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:23,583
I was just expecting
you to chew me out.

193
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:25,625
The others have already
done that for me.

194
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:27,541
There's no point
in wasting time.

195
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:30,541
Well, thanks, I appreciate that.

196
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:34,125
[FUUKA inahles]
Okay, let's do this, guys!

197
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:36,833
[drunk sticks tapping]

198
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:39,208
[music plays]

199
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:49,625
Wait, we're an opening act?

200
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:53,375
That's right, you missed the
news because you were so late!

201
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:54,958
I'm never gonna live that down.

202
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:56,208
'Kay, here's the deal:

203
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:58,458
Hisashi introduced us
to his friend's club,

204
00:09:58,541 --> 00:09:59,750
and we're the opening act!

205
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:01,666
He said it's our chance
to try something new

206
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,333
and polish our skills.

207
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:04,791
We're really lucky
your brother's

208
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:06,416
doting on us like this.

209
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,541
We finally get to strut
our stuff alongside

210
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:11,291
some other bands.
I am so freakin' pumped!

211
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:13,458
Whoa, cool it down
over there, tiger.

212
00:10:13,541 --> 00:10:15,166
You know it's not a
competition, right?

213
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,958
Next thing we know,
you'll be beating your chest

214
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:18,375
and flexing shirtless.

215
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:21,041
Don't you wish. I'll flex
shirtless in your dreams!

216
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:22,583
This is so amazing!

217
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:25,291
Our first chance to play as
Fallen Moon in public together!

218
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:26,875
Yep, it's historic!

219
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:29,583
But what are we gonna play?

220
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:32,541
Just some more Hedgehogs covers?

221
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:34,625
That's a good question.

222
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:37,541
Actually, I kinda wanted to
talk to you guys about that.

223
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:39,541
Is everyone free right now?

224
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:47,583
Here's the thing.
I have a proposal.

225
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:50,333
I think that we should
write an original song.

226
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:52,625
[GROUP]
Uh...

227
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:55,708
That's all well and good.
Who's gonna write it though?

228
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:57,083
[FUUKA]
Mm.

229
00:10:57,166 --> 00:10:59,000
Uh. You're gonna write it?

230
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:00,791
[FUUKA]
Mm-hm.

231
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:02,791
 Okay, let's slow down.

232
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:04,000
Can you do it?

233
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:05,958
[FUUKA]
Mm!

234
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:08,833
'Kay, remind me. Do you play
any instruments at all?

235
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:10,250
Come on!

236
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:11,916
Just because I can't play
an instrument doesn't mean

237
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,333
I can't write a song, you know!

238
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:14,708
 Easy as pie.

239
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:16,791
[FUUKA humming]

240
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:22,500
This is painful.

241
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:25,083
So, it's unconventional.
That suits Fuuka.

242
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:26,416
I guess.

243
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,833
Who cares how she does it?

244
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:29,458
As long as it's done
before our gig.

245
00:11:29,541 --> 00:11:32,208
I promise you, I'll finish
in plenty of time!

246
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:35,583
Well, I think it sounds great.
Fallen Moon's first original.

247
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:38,083
Music and lyrics
by Fuuka Akitsuki.

248
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:39,083
Yeah, pretty cool.

249
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:40,250
[FUUKA gasping]

250
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:42,125
No pressure, but it
needs to rock, 'kay?

251
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:45,333
Yeah, about that. I was just
mulling it over last night.

252
00:11:45,416 --> 00:11:48,000
Before I start writing, I think
we should have a discussion

253
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:50,083
about what our
influences should be!

254
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:51,500
--[MIKASA] Sure.
--[NACHI] Yeah.

255
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,500
[MIKASA]
Hm. That's a very good point.

256
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:10,708
I agree with that.

257
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:12,416
[phone vibrates]

258
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:15,166
Sorry, be right back.

259
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:16,666
Okay, but I still
think it should be

260
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,041
something that fires up
the crowd at our show.

261
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:19,291
[NACHI] Then I think
we should listen to

262
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:21,041
some of the Hedgehogs
stuff for inspirati...

263
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:23,166
[KOYUKI] Wow! Fuuka's
writing an original?

264
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:24,958
[YUU] Yeah, but we're still
trying to decide

265
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:27,500
what type of song it should be,
so I'm a little worried about

266
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:29,416
whether it'll be
finished in time.

267
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,208
[KOYUKI] I guess you'll
just have to trust Fuuka

268
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:32,583
to do her best.

269
00:12:32,666 --> 00:12:33,833
When we asked how
she'd write it,

270
00:12:33,916 --> 00:12:36,250
she said "like this!"
and she started humming!

271
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:38,750
[KOYUKI laughs]
That's just like her.

272
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:41,791
Yeah, it sure is.

273
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:43,291
You sound happy.

274
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:45,208
Well, I know I just saw
earlier you today,

275
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:47,208
but I already have
so much to tell you!

276
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:48,833
[YUU]
Yeah, I know what you mean!

277
00:12:48,916 --> 00:12:50,583
[YUU sniffles]

278
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:51,958
You getting sick?

279
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:54,583
[YUU] No, I'm just standing
outside a restaurant.

280
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:55,666
Uh.

281
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,041
[YUU]
We were having a band meeting.

282
00:12:57,125 --> 00:12:59,708
Oh. Sorry I called
at a bad time.

283
00:12:59,791 --> 00:13:02,666
I'll try to catch you
again later, okay?

284
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:05,875
Wait. It's just...

285
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:09,583
I'm really glad that you're
feeling much better now.

286
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:11,416
[KOYUKI]
It's mostly because of you.

287
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,750
[YUU laughs]

288
00:13:18,708 --> 00:13:22,791
Talk to you soon, Tama.
I'll call you next time.

289
00:13:23,791 --> 00:13:26,666
Uh. Sorry. Just finished up.

290
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:29,916
Oh. Cool.

291
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:42,083
[singing]

292
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:53,208
[FUUKA singing]

293
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:57,500
Yeah, I think this one works
the best out of all of 'em.

294
00:13:57,583 --> 00:14:00,708
Okay, so that takes care
of the melody, then.

295
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:02,750
And now for the lyrics.

296
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,375
I guess you couldn't help
it if you were on a date

297
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:09,750
with your girlfriend.

298
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:12,541
Talk to you soon, Tama.

299
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:15,416
No, no, no, I need
a change of pace!

300
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:24,166
[FUUKA] 
Know what, Koyuki?

301
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:27,625
Listen, I'm rooting
for your love, okay?

302
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:29,625
I've tried rooting for her.

303
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:32,500
[FUUKA] But I still have no
idea, what it's really like

304
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:34,750
to be in love.

305
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:36,791
What's this feeling?

306
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:38,791
I don't like it.

307
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:44,416
[bass guitar plays]

308
00:14:50,791 --> 00:14:54,541
[YUU] 
Hm... Let's see.

309
00:14:57,208 --> 00:14:58,166
Uh?

310
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:01,541
[FUUKA]
Look at these little alpacas.

311
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:03,625
You can have this one.

312
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:07,000
I remember this.
That was a good day.

313
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:11,333
I wonder how her new
song is coming along.

314
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:13,875
There you are!

315
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:16,500
I'd better make sure
I don't fall behind.

316
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,541
[FUUKA] 
Ta-dah!

317
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:37,291
I'm finished with the new song!

318
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:39,125
[GROUP]
Oh!

319
