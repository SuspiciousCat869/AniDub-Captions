160
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:52,125
Then why couldn't you
just come out and say so?

161
00:06:52,208 --> 00:06:55,583
[YUU exhales]
Sorry.

162
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:56,916
[FUUKA sighs]

163
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,583
[YUU] I just happened meet
Koyuki again recently.

164
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:02,500
It was like nothing had changed
at all since we were kids.

165
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:05,041
It felt good to reconnect.

166
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:07,791
And besides, she was one
of the few close friends I had

167
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:09,125
when I was growing up.
So, it's kind--

168
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:11,833
[FUUKA]
Okay, okay! I get it.

169
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:14,291
And you're right, we gotta keep
our heads in the game.

170
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:16,750
We shouldn't fight right
before a concert.

171
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:18,250
Yeah, I agree.

172
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:20,875
[FUUKA] Anyway, is Koyuki
okay after what happened?

173
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:21,666
[YUU gasps]

174
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,750
I mean, she's a celebrity!

175
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:26,791
You know, my family
said the same thing.

176
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:30,833
[FUUKA sighs]

177
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:34,416
[FUUKA] Welp, I'm gonna
head back now.

178
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,291
[YUU]
Hey, wait for me!

179
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:43,583
[KOYUKI] "Koyuki Hinashi
and I are just friends.

180
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:48,916
I'm sorry for upsetting all
her fans." Just friends.

181

--[knocking]
--[KOYUKI gasps]

182
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:55,541
[STAGE MANAGER A] Hinashi.
This is your five minute call.

183
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:57,041
[KOYUKI]
Thank you.

184
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:04,541
[audience claps]

185
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:06,666
Well, it's almost time
to wrap up our program,

186
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,708
so thanks for
staying tuned in!

187
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:11,125
Thank god. Looks like
we're in the clear now.

188
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:13,625
But before we go,
I understand Koyuki Hinashi

189
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:15,916
has an important announcement
she wants to share with us.

190
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,083
[MALE HOST B]
What could it be?

191
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:18,875
Surely you're not
promoting a new song?

192
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:22,875
Yes! I'm releasing a new
single called Snow Fireworks!

193
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:24,500
I hope you'll all check it out!

194
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:26,291
That's a very interesting title.

195
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:28,125
Can you describe
the song for us?

196
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:30,541
Let's see.
Well, it's a ballad, for one

197
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:33,416
And it's inspired by a
personal experience I had.

198
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,708
[YAMADA]
Huh?

199
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:36,166
'Kay.

200
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:41,083
Man. It ripped me up
back then, though.

201
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:44,291
Because I never got the chance
to tell you that I liked you.

202
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:51,625
I had a childhood friend.

203
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:53,041
We'd been separated
from each other

204
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:54,958
for a really long time, so...

205
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:56,958
I found him again
online only recently

206
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:58,333
when I started using Twitter.

207
00:08:58,416 --> 00:09:00,416
What is she saying?
This isn't what we discussed!

208
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,041
After that, I went to Shonan
to film a music video,

209
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:04,666
and we hung out
while I was there.

210
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:07,416
It was raining, but we
lit fireworks anyway

211
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,833
and we've been meeting
occasionally since then.

212
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:11,333
[MALE HOST A]
Is that so?

213
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:13,291
Then a picture of us
ended up on the internet,

214
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:15,625
which came as quite a
surprise to both of us!

215
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:17,791
Wow, so she's admitting
now that it was her

216
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:19,208
in the picture with that guy!

217
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:22,250
I get it one of those
viral marketing things.

218
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:25,208
[MALE HOST A] Um, is it cool
that we're discussing this?

219
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:26,291
[YAMADA groans]

220
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:27,833
Sure!

221
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:31,875
[MIKASA]
Hey.

222
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:33,166
[YUU]
Uh?

223
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:37,541
Look at this.

224
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:40,000
Then people online automatically
jumped to conclusions.

225
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:42,125
They assumed he was my
boyfriend or something!

226
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:43,416
Or at least that
we'd been dating.

227
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,250
What? Um, what is she doing?

228
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:49,250
But there's honestly nothing
like that between us at all.

229
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:51,166
To tell you the truth,
this whole thing caused

230
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:54,000
a lot of trouble for him,
so he might be mad at me now.

231
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:57,916
But he's been a very
good friend to me.

232
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,708
What's going on?

233
00:09:58,791 --> 00:10:01,458
[gasps]

234
00:10:01,541 --> 00:10:06,166
Hopeless, I swear.
After all we told her!

235
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:07,666
So, you're just friends, then!

236
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:10,333
Well, I'm not gonna lie, even
I'm a little bit relieved!

237
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:14,291
Yes, he's definitely
my very good friend.

238
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:16,833
However, he's also
my unrequited love.

239
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:19,375
Those are the feelings I tried
to express in my new song,

240
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:20,375
"Snow Fireworks."

241
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:22,708
[gasps]

242
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:25,708
[KOYUKI]
Actually, not just that song.

243
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:28,583
Pretty much everything I've
ever written is about him.

244
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:30,583
[gasps]

245
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:35,291
[FUUKA]
Well, we're all set!

246
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:38,333
[NACHI sighs] Looks like we've
got everything ready to go.

247
00:10:38,416 --> 00:10:40,916
[MIKASA] Yeah. I wish
we had a better set-up.

248
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,541
We could really use some more
mics and another monitor.

249
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:44,416
[NACHI exhales]

250
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,625
[MIKASA]
Huh?

251
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,250
I'm really sorry.

252
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:57,583
It's our first concert tomorrow
and all this crazy stuff

253
00:10:57,666 --> 00:10:59,750
is happening because of me.

254
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:02,125
Well, can't say it
wasn't a surprise.

255
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:04,041
Hearing that you were
the unrequited love

256
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:06,625
of a certain pop star.

257
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:10,375
But here's the thing. That has
nothing to do with our concert.

258
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:12,333
So no apologies, 'kay?

259
00:11:12,416 --> 00:11:14,083
I agree with him.

260
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:17,875
[YUU] Thanks, guys,
but since I tweeted that

261
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:19,875
we'd be performing
at the school fair,

262
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:22,041
a bunch of people replied that
they'd come just to ruin it.

263
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:23,958
[NACHI]
That has nothing to do with us!

264
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:26,125
If they think they can,
let 'em try!

265
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:27,375
If I'm bein' real with you,

266
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:29,041
I'm more worried you'll
freak out on us

267
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:30,416
and ruin the bass line, man.

268
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,875
[YUU]
Uh...

269
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:34,458
[MIKASA]
Faint heart never won fair lady.

270
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:38,083
Don't worry about the people who
talk crap. Take it in stride.

271
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:39,750
They're right.
Plus, the Twitter thing

272
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:43,291
might actually help because it
could bring in a bigger crowd.

273
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:45,625
Thanks, guys.

274
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:47,375
[FUUKA]
We'll hold our heads high.

275
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:49,541
There's no doubt we've
practiced as hard as we could

276
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:52,958
for this first concert.
We're ready!

277
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:55,541
You did nothing wrong
and neither did Koyuki.

278
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:57,791
You've both been really honest.

279
00:11:57,875 --> 00:11:59,458
Thank you for that.

280
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:01,041
No one has the
right to judge.

281
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:03,333
People can't help the way
they feel about others.

282
00:12:03,416 --> 00:12:05,958
So don't let those haters
get you all depressed!

283
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:08,041
She's right, you know.
Listen to her.

284
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:09,541
Ow!

285
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:12,708
Let's play our hearts out!
Everything's gonna be perfect!

286
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:23,833
They wanna ruin it, huh? Great.

287
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:26,208
Man, ugh! That totally sucks!

288
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:27,916
Why do people gotta
be such jerks?

289
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,833
What a freakin' drag!

290
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:32,916
I never said I wanted to be in
this band in the first place!

291
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,208
But somehow, I got forced into
being the leader just because

292
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:38,333
I had no clue what to do with
myself after high school!

293
00:12:38,416 --> 00:12:40,083
I could just back out.

294
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:50,000
Nah, can't do that, no way.
I guess I've got no choice!

295
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:51,541
I'm in, whether I
like it or not!

296
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:53,958
For the love of god,
get it together, Nachi!

297
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:55,291
You're their leader!

298
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:56,875
[NACHI'S GRANDMA] What are
you carrying on about?

299
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:58,875
[NACHI]
Nothing, Grandma!

300
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:10,458
[MIKASA]
Huh? Now? I don't know.

301
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:15,625
I'm sorry. I think I should
turn in early tonight.

302
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:19,291
Yeah. Tomorrow's a
really big day for me.

303
00:13:22,916 --> 00:13:26,083
[MIKASA]
I can't run away. Not now.

304
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:30,666
[MIKASA] No, there's never
a need to run.

305
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:43,041
[SARA] How awful. Yuu didn't
even do anything wrong.

306
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:49,750
Hey, Sara! Mind keeping an eye
on the place for a little bit?

307
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:53,291
[HISA grunts] What's goin' on?
You look down.

308
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:55,875
It's only been
two months, but I...

309
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:57,208
[HISA]
Uh?

310
00:13:57,291 --> 00:13:58,750
[SARA] I love playing
with these new bandmates.

311
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:00,125
It's changed everything.
