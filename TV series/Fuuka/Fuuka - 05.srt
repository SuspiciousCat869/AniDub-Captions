157
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:55,791
I don't get it, Nachi.

158
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,666
You told us that you'd
played the drums before.

159
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:00,583
Hey. Look, I'm just a member
of the track team, okay?

160
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:02,791
And anyway, it's not like
you could play that guitar

161
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:04,333
worth a crap, either!

162
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:07,458
I know! I mean, it's my first
time playing, though, so...

163
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:09,000
And you, Mikasa.

164
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:11,791
I thought that you were supposed
to be so good on the piano.

165
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:14,208
Didn't you even win
some competition?

166
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:16,666
This doesn't feel
anything like a real piano.

167
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:19,625
And anyway, that was a
pretty long time ago.

168
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:21,166
[HISA]
That's enough, you guys.

169
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,375
[knocking]

170
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:23,958
[HISA, MIKASA]
Hm?

171
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:26,791
Hey, man. have you got a minute?

172
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:29,458
[HISA]
Mm?

173
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:31,208
We need to talk about Sara.

174
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:33,500
Oh, great. Yeah?

175
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:36,458
[GUY B] We did this because you
asked us to, but we've had it.

176
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:37,875
We can't deal with her anymore.

177
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:42,041
Gotcha. I'm sorry.
Thanks for trying though.

178
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:44,125
[HISA sighs]
Not again.

179
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:47,583
[FUUKA]
What happened? You okay?

180
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:51,708
Yeah. There's just something
going on with my little sister.

181
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:56,666
[NACHI, MIKASA]
Hm?

182
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,416
Her band's been
practicing down there,

183
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,375
but she just got kicked out.

184
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:02,833
--[guitar playing]
--Hear that? That's her.

185
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:07,708
[YUU, FUUKA gasp]

186
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:14,416
[music continues]

187
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,291
She's a really strong
guitar player.

188
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:18,375
But she is one
weak communicator.

189
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:20,500
Is she really that
much of a handful?

190
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:22,916
Well, she's been fired
three times now.

191
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,666
That's kind of a lot.

192
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:27,708
[HISA] No one ever wants to
work with her for very long.

193
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:32,125
Hey! Let's be in
a band together!

194
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:33,375
What?

195
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:35,416
[YUU] Hang on, we should
talk about it before--

196
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,750
[yelps]

197
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:39,250
[SARA grunts]

198
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:41,416
[YUU groans]

199
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:47,083
Seriously, Sara?
What is wrong with you?

200
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:48,958
[YUU grunts]

201
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:50,791
'Kay. Let's do it.

202
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:52,541
Wait. Do you mean it?

203
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:54,958
Talk to me, Yuu! Are you okay?

204
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:57,833
[YUU]
Please, no!

205
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,125
So, uh, what's this
symbol mean right here?

206
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:12,666
[HISA]
That's called a slide.

207
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:15,041
You slide from to 6
without lifting your fingers

208
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:16,708
from the strings.

209
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:18,458
[FUUKA]
Then it goes "dwang", like that.

210
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:20,000
"Dwang", you know?

211
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:21,375
[YUU]
Can't concentrate.

212
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:24,000
She's still over there
glaring daggers.

213
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:26,875
Just give up already.
It's irritating.

214
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:29,541
[gasps]

215
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:32,541
Hey, Sara, there's no excuse
for you to be so rude.

216
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:34,750
I'm trying to be honest.

217
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:37,833
Now, now, new friend, what if
we go ahead and stop here today?

218
00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:40,000
Yeah, good call,
I'm hungry, anyway.

219
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:42,166
Great.

220
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:43,750
I know!

221
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:45,625
Let's all go out to dinner to
celebrate our first practice!

222
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:48,000
And our leader, Nachi,
can foot the bill!

223
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:49,833
Wait, since when
am I the leader?

224
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:51,333
I didn't ask for that!

225
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:53,791
[FUUKA] Don't run away, Sara!
Come out with us, senpai!

226
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:56,333
[SARA grunts]

227
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:58,625
Hey, maybe you shouldn't push
her if she doesn't want

228
00:10:58,708 --> 00:10:59,500
to go out to dinner.

229
00:10:59,583 --> 00:11:02,916
Shut up, she's one of us now!

230
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,416
[SARA]
Hm...

231
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:18,541
[YUU]
She actually came.

232
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:21,083
So, our first cover will be
"Climber's High", right?

233
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:22,875
I mean, I know it's
kinda hard, but...

234
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:25,000
I can do it without
a problem. It'll be fine!

235
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:26,750
[MIKASA]
Sure, I'll give it a try.

236
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:30,458
Sara, is that cool with you?
You're pretty quiet.

237
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:33,041
Yeah, I'll be fine, but that's
got a tricky bass line.

238
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:35,708
[coughs]

239
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:37,083
You feelin' a little nervous?

240
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:39,125
Sounds like you've
got some work to do!

241
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:40,625
You know,

242
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:42,166
I never agreed to being put
under this kind of pressure!

243
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:44,333
But don't you remember
that famous, old saying?

244
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:46,125
In the face of adversity,
a man truly shines!

245
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:47,833
Would you shut up, already?

246
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:50,208
Inspirational "hot guy"
quotes will not help!

247
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:52,416
Making a beginner like me
try to play a song like that

248
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,625
is just wrong! I mean,
I can't even read music!

249
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:58,250
[FUUKA] Oops, sorry.
I just realized, I have to go!

250
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:01,416
[FUUKA]
See ya later!

251
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,500
Yeah, I should take off, too.

252
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:04,333
I've actually got
a date tonight.

253
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:06,166
Guess I better go, too.

254
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:08,458
I was supposed to help
out at home, anyway.

255
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:10,250
[gasps]
Are you kidding?

256
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:12,166
[FUUKA]
Thanks for the dinner, leader!

257
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:16,000
[NACHI] Oh, gimme a break.
So, Mikasa, who's the girl?

258
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:18,375
[MIKASA] I refuse to
believe you're that dense.

259
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:21,041
Uh...

260
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:32,708
So, I guess. You don't have any
pressing engagements, either.

261
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:40,166
Hey, you must be hungry, yeah?
You didn't eat anything earlier.

262
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:42,375

The chocolate
brownie sundae? Okay.

265

[YUU] I'll just apologize
for today and head home.

00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:37,708
Um. I'm really sorry about what
happened today, and I promise

273
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:40,041
I'll keep practicing so
I won't embarrass the band.

[YUU] Did she seriously
just take a picture?

276
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:48,583
Is she uploading it? She wants
to humiliate me online?

[YUU] Huh. That looks
just like Iwami's sundae.

No... It couldn't be.

Wait. You're him?

00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:28,708
Yeah... Hi.

285
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:31,916
No way! Are you kidding me?!

286
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,041
I just assumed you
had the same name!

287
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:35,458
I can't believe it's really you!

288
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,750
Sorry for this psycho
shift in demeanor.

289
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:39,666
Did I freak you out?
I mean, come on, though,

290
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:43,333
you really should have told me
who you were! Oh my gosh.

291
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:45,083
I referred to you as my
"friend" in that tweet

292
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:47,250
and that was presumptuous
of me, wasn't it?

293
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:49,708
There's just so much I want to
talk to you about now, though!

294
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:52,750
I can't believe I'm
meeting you like this!

[WAITRESS A]
Thank you! Come again!

296
00:14:57,416 --> 00:14:59,458
[SARA] The lousy way my
brother was teaching you guys

297
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:01,791
at the studio was
making me so mad.

298
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:03,291
Oh yeah,

299
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:05,375
and I'm really sorry about
hitting you with my guitar.

300
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:06,875
You just startled me.

301
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:09,333
I've actually been wanting
to apologize all day.

302
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:10,833
Wow. I'm so sorry.

303
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:13,250
I feel like I'm the one
doing all the talking!

304
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:15,291
No, that's okay.

305
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:16,666
It's a thing.

306
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,083
I always say stuff the wrong
way and tick people off.

307
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:20,250
Like today.

308
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:22,833
That's why... I get
kicked out of bands.

309
00:15:22,916 --> 00:15:28,541
[YUU] Oh... I get it.
She's actually just like me.

310
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:30,083
