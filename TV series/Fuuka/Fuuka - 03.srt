I have an order. I need
two ramens, please.

159
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:15,750
[YAHAGI grunts]
How many times I gotta say it?!

160
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:19,291
Speak up, Haruna!

161
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:24,750
Look, kid. You need to
get yourself together.

162
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:26,000
Yeah, I know.

163
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:29,416
[YAHAGI grunts]
Take a little break and think.

164
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,625
Or, you could always go home.

165
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:59,416
[sighs] What did I
even come here for?

166
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:06,958
Maybe I will go.

167
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:09,333
[FUUKA]
No, you can't!

168
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:10,500
[YUU]
You scared me.

169
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:13,458
Don't say that.
Don't say you're leaving.

170
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:16,958
[gasps, grunts]

171
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:18,833
[YUU] I'm not cut out
for this kind of thing.

172
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:20,958
I keep screwing up and
embarrassing myself,

173
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:22,833
over and over.

174
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:26,333
I just look pathetic.
The band will be the same.

175
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:29,250
Nah, I don't agree.
You only mess up sometimes

176
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:31,083
because you don't handle
stress all that well.

177
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:32,208
You let it get to you.

178
00:08:32,291 --> 00:08:33,291
[YUU grunts]

179
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:36,291
But I know you lead
with your heart.

180
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:37,625
Like when you tried to save me

181
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:40,083
from being recruited
to the track team.

182
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:44,583
Or when I was weepy and you were
worried that I might be upset.

183
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:48,875
If you ask me, that makes
you a cool person.

184
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:50,875
Thanks, but I don't get it.

185
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:52,208
[FUUKA]
I want you to be in the band

186
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:54,666
because I know you'll work
with your whole heart.

187
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,583
I know you'll try your best.

188
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:59,166
I don't want just
any old slacker.

189
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,333
Uh?

190
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:03,041
So, you're staying!

191
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:05,458
Now, let's go show Yahagi
what you're made of!

192
00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:07,625
Time to prove you
can really do this!

193
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:09,125
[gasps]

194
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:14,625
[FUUKA]
Alright! Okay, let's get inside!

195
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:18,125
Come on, come on, let's go,
let's go, let's go!

196
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:25,166
'Scuse me, waiter!
I have an order!

197
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:26,791
Two fried rice
and yakisoba, please!

198
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:27,666
And shaved ice.

199
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:28,958
And I'll have the ramen.

200
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:30,875
Pardon me, is this table open?

201
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:33,125
Ramens up! Order for table five!

202
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:36,000
Yes! How can I help you?
Are you ready to order?

203
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:40,666
Two fried rice, yakisoba,
shaved ice, and ramen.

204
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:47,541
It is! I'll clear
it for you now, sir!

205
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:49,750
[YUU] One ramen and
a yakisoba, please!

206
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:51,208
[YAHAGI]
Okay...

207
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:53,333
Next, two fried rice!

208
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:54,750
[YAHAGI]
Got it!

209
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:57,250
Two ramens, please!

210
00:09:57,333 --> 00:10:00,250
Yeah, got it! He, he...

211
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:03,041
See? I knew you
had it in ya, kid.

212
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:04,458
[YUU]
Okay, great.

213
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:06,416
Let me just repeat your order
back to you, two ramens,

214
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,000
one yakisoba, one fried rice...

215
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:09,333
[GUY H]
Excuse me, miss!

216
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:10,708
Be right there!

217
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:20,541
[YAHAGI] And... with that,
the day is done. Not bad work.

218
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:22,083
Thanks so much for the job.

219
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:25,833
So, about that Haruna kid.
He doin' okay?

220
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:27,666
It was just mild
heat exhaustion.

221
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,500
I think he should be
alright as long as he gets

222
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:31,083
to rest a little.

223
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:34,166
It's no wonder, the way he ran
around all day with no breaks.

224
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:36,041
Anyone would keel over.

225
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:37,416
But without him,

226
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,208
we couldn't have handled
all the afternoon customers.

227
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:40,750
He made a huge difference.

228
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:43,166
Yep. There's no doubt.

229
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:52,625
[YUU snores]

230
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:55,875
For somebody who's
usually so awkward,

231
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:59,250
today, you found your groove.

232
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:13,000
We'll begin filming almost
immediately after we arrive.

233
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:14,416
[KOYUKI]
Thanks.

234
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,250
Oh yeah, also...

235
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:19,208
I was wondering if we'd have
any free time this evening.

236
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:21,291
Yes, it's only a
daytime shoot.

237
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:23,291
So you should be free tonight.

238
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:24,916
That's good to know.

239
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:35,916
[YUU] There's something
I don't understand.

240
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,166
[MIKASA]
What?

241
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:39,875
Why does Akitsuki even
bother with me at all?

242
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:43,500
Come on, man.
Don't doubt yourself.

243
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:46,583
It's pretty obvious that she
acts differently towards you.

244
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:48,500
It's like I said before.

245
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:51,375
I think Fuuka is just naturally
drawn to you, my friend.

246
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:56,416
You really think so?
In all seriousness?

247
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,333
Yep, but if you ask me,
the important question is

248
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:01,833
how you feel about
that fact, you know?

249
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:03,375
How I feel?

250
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:06,208
I'm off! You're on your
own while I land a date.

251
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:08,708
I saw a really hot
lifeguard back there.

252
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:12,375
[YUU]
Have fun.

253
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,666
How do I feel about
Akitsuki being drawn to--

254
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,625
[grunts] What the--?

255
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:20,958
[FUUKA gasps]

256
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:23,125
Wanna come play with me?

257
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:26,333
[YUU gasps]
Uh, sure.

258
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:29,083
[FUUKA]
Huh?

259
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,625
C'mon, kick faster and
swim harder, Yuu!

260
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:39,583
I know you can do it!
Giddyap, cowboy!

261
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:43,541
[gasps]

262
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:52,416
[FUUKA sighs] We're definitely
heading the wrong way.

263
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,000
Try to keep your eyes forward.

264
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:56,416
[YUU]
Nope. I'm good like this.

265
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,833
Huh?

266
00:12:57,916 --> 00:12:59,375
[YUU] You physically assaulted
me when you thought

267
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:03,041
I saw your panties. Yet that
bathing suit is somehow okay?

268
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:04,958
[FUUKA]
Mm... What'd you say?

269
00:13:05,041 --> 00:13:07,375
[YUU]
Nothing! Nothing at all!

270
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:09,250
[YUU] I'm beginning to
think I was just imagining

271
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:12,208
that she liked me
that way at all.

272
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:16,416
It's more like... she just
doesn't see me as a guy.

273
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,125
Yuu, what's going on with you?

274
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:20,208
You look like you're
lost in thought.

275
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:23,375
No, just daydreaming.
So, tell me something.

276
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:26,458
What made you suddenly decide
to start a band, anyway?

277
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:29,416
What do you mean? You're the one
who said I should make music.

278
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,625
Don't you remember?

279
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:32,958
[YUU] Well, you said
you like Koyuki Hinashi,

280
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:36,000
so I guess I assumed
you'd go solo is all.

281
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:39,583
If I'm gonna make music,

282
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:42,500
I think it'd be the most
fun to make it with you.

283
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:44,041
[YUU groans]

284
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:50,375
[FUUKA gasps] Woah. I think
we've drifted out way too far!

285
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:53,500
[YUU gasps]

286
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:55,333
We have to get back!

287
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:58,541
[FUUKA grunts]

288
00:13:59,916 --> 00:14:05,041
[FUUKA pants]
My leg... cramped!

289
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:09,291
Akitsuki! Are you...?

290
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:11,250
Just hang on, I'm coming!

291
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:32,875
[FUUKA grunting]

292
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:42,833
[YUU grunts]

293
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:48,250
[YUU coughs]

294
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:51,708
Oh, thank goodness!
You're alive!

295
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:57,166
[YUU]
Was that...?

296
00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:00,458
I'm sorry. You almost
drowned trying to save me.

297
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:02,666
You had stopped breathing.

298
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:05,041
I was afraid you
were already dead.

299
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:06,833
No, that's... awful.

300
00:15:06,916 --> 00:15:10,083
Yeah, it was. I was
so worried about you!

301
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:11,916
You jerk!

302
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:37,750
Guess we'll have to get the
rest of the footage tomorrow.

303
00:15:37,833 --> 00:15:39,250
I'll fit it into the schedule.

304
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:41,916
Great, thank you. Wanna
go grab something to eat?

305
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,166
[GUY I]
Sure.

306
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,666
[KOYUKI giggles]

307
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:56,041
Hey, we're back from our break!

308
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:58,541
Good! Welcome back.

309
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:01,666
[YUU exhales softly]

310
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:04,333
What is up with him?
Look at his eyes.

311
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:07,333
It's like he's totally
dead inside.

312
00:16:07,416 --> 00:16:10,625
[FUUKA]
Hm? Yuu? What's going on?

313
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:11,833
[YUU]
