158
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:02,625
You like Mikasa. I think
that's pretty obvious.

159
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:04,041
But he's friendly
with other girls, too,

160
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:05,666
so you're in some kind
of love triangle, right?

161
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:06,875
Um...

162
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:08,541
Look, what I'm trying to say--

163
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:12,083
Yuu, he and I have only ever
been really good friends.

164

[YUU]
Uh...

165
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:14,750
Besides, Makoto
doesn't really...

166
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:16,375
[MIKASA]
Oh, that's right...

167
00:07:17,708 --> 00:07:19,875

so he doesn't know yet.

I can't believe it.

So that's why you had
the wrong idea about us!

174

[YUU]
Yeah, go ahead, laugh it up.

175
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,583
Just tell me this: why were
you crying before?

176
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:43,333
[FUUKA]
When did I cry?

177
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:46,333
You were in the hall
by yourself... and I saw you.

178
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:52,458
[FUUKA] Hm... Oh! I think
I know what you saw.

179
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:55,916
I bet... I was
listening to this one.

180

Is that?

181
00:07:58,208 --> 00:08:00,791
It's just so good!
It gets me every time.

182

Here, you can borrow it!
You'll have a good cry!

183
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:04,416
It was just a song?

184
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,291
[FUUKA] Duh! The lyrics
are beautiful and sad.

185
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:10,375
It's all about her long lost
love and how she misses him.

186
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:12,583
[YUU]
Oh, Okay.

187
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:15,291
I assumed you were really
upset about something.

188
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:17,791
Ha! You jump to conclusions
a lot, don't you?

189
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:19,375
No.

190
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:25,250
You're not wrong.
Something is bothering me.

191

Not love troubles
or anything, but...

192
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:31,625
...I don't know what I want.
I'm just confused.

193
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:35,708
Nothing I try to do
is right for me.

194

to do with my life?!

Uh... Why not track?

I tried for a while,
but it wasn't right.

197

Well, what do you think?

198
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,666
Do you have any
brilliant ideas for me?

199
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:52,916
[YUU gasps] Why ask me?
How am I supposed to know?

200
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,500
[FUUKA] I guess that's true.
Thanks anyway, though.

201
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:59,208
You saw me crying alone and
actually felt sad for me,

202
00:08:59,291 --> 00:08:59,791
didn't you?

203
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:01,333
Well, yeah.

I get the feeling "kindness"
is your middle name, isn't it?

[MIKASA]
A bird...

224
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:20,458
I guess. Though, if she is,
then she's a bird in a cage.

I dunno know what you mean.

[MIKASA]
I sense it sometimes.

227
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:26,333
She flutters around and
appears to be having fun,

228
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:28,166
but it's like she's trapped.

229
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,666
Like she's searching
for what's missing,

230
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:32,375
but she's in too small
a space to find it.

231

is a apt description.

236

Was there a point?

237
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:50,291
[MIKASA] Hm! Yes, I did have
a point, as a matter of fact.

00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:51,791
I thought that maybe
you could be the one

and let her soar.

Well, originally, I was supposed
to be coming with Miho.

311
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:21,375
But she ended up having
to cancel, so...

Yeah, she's my cousin.

I thought,

"Wow. I have no choice
but to invite Yuu."

it was my big dream
to perform here.

and believe in you.

my memories into songs.

Yes, though they're
not all about him.

328

But, you know,
it was thanks to him

329
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:09,333
that I decided to become
a singer at all.

330
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:11,708
And I've always wanted
to sing my best.

331
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:14,958
So that one day,
my song might reach him.

332
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:18,458
Well, let the agency know if you
guys end up going out, okay?

333
00:15:18,541 --> 00:15:20,458
It'd probably be
great for publicity.
