00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:31,541
Uh? Why should I?

159
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:33,958
I wanna have a look at all the
pictures you've been taking.

160
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:35,583
Uh...

161
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:38,250
But, I never meant--

162
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:39,958
So you were taking
upskirt pics?

163
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:41,708
No, just shots of the scenery!

164
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:43,833
[FUUKA] Then why'd you
say you never "meant" to?

165
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:46,291
I don't know,
I guess I panicked!

166
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:48,458
If there's nothing to hide,
then just show me!

167
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:50,541
There's personal stuff on here!

168
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:53,041
Gimme the phone,
you big pervert!

169
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:54,958
Back off!

170
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:55,875
Calm dow--

171
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:57,250
[BOTH gasp]

172
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:02,208
Why?! That was a loaner
from the repair shop, too!

173
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:03,583
[FUUKA]
Uh...

174
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,500
[YUU] I was so sure
it landed around here.

175
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:26,125
[sighs]

176
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:27,500
[FUUKA]
Hey.

177
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:33,625
[YUU]
What are you doing here?

178
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:36,291
[FUUKA]
I'll help you look for it.

179
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,250
My plan is to see if
the picture you took

180
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:40,125
was really of
the scenery, and if not,

181
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:41,708
then my plan is
to kick your butt.

182
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:43,041
[YUU]
Jeez, you're violent!

183
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:44,750
[FUUKA] Maybe, but if
you're telling the truth,

184
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:46,333
it won't be an issue, right?

185
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:48,333
Well, yeah, but still.

186
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:52,000
[YUU} Hey! Let's try calling
my number with your phone!

187
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:52,750
[FUUKA]
Can't.

188
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:54,958
[YUU]
Uh, why not?

189
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:57,500
Because, I don't
have cell phone.

190
00:09:57,583 --> 00:10:00,041
[YUU gasps]
You're kidding, right?

191
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:04,375
[YUU]
Man, this girl's weird.

192
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:06,666
[FUUKA] No. I'd rather
listen to music,

193
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:09,750
than blog, or tweet,
or whatever.

194
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:12,500
[YUU] But you can download
tons of music on a phone.

195
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:14,375
Yeah, but I prefer CDs.

196
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:18,041
[YUU grunts]
That's right. Here you go.

197
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:20,125
I thought I lost that yesterday!

198
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:23,250
Well, yeah, you did. I found it.

199
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:26,250
And I never tried to
take your picture.

200
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:38,416
Hey, I'm home.

201
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,000
[HIBIKI]
Welcome home.

202
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:42,625
You've been unusually quiet
on Twitter for a while.

203
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:43,791
Kinda bizarre.

204
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:46,250
Yeah, I lost my phone earlier.

205
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:48,583
Would you put some clothes on?

206
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:52,458
Good, you're here! Do you
know where my T-shirt is?

207
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:54,666
My favorite one with
the weird face on it?

208
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:57,375
Nope, I sure don't.
Put something else on.

209
00:10:57,458 --> 00:11:00,166
Glad you're home!
You should hurry, though.

210
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:03,125
You need to take your bath now,
the water will get cold.

211
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:04,791
What are you, nudists?!

212
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:06,166
[ALL gasp]

213
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,000
No, it's just so hot.

214
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:09,958
We're all family.
What does it matter?

215
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:12,416
You guys, I still
can't find my shirt!

216
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,958
[YUU groans]

217
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:17,125
[HIBIKI] I think maybe Maya
turned that shirt into a rag.

218
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:19,750
[MAYA] Oh, that one?
Yeah, it had a hole in it, so...

219
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:23,166
[CHITOSE]
No! Maya, how could you?!

220
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:34,750
[YUU sighs]
Too many women.

221
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:37,708
[gasps] Keep forgetting
I don't have a phone.

222
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:41,250
[YUU grunts]

223
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:52,875
She really is a weird one.

224
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:02,208
Not sure what to say.
I'm Yuu Haruna.

225
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:03,958
It's nice to meet you all.

226
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:05,708
[MALE STUDENT A]
We can't hear you over here!

227
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:07,583
Why don't you speak up?

228
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:10,791
[gasps]

229
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:13,083
[STUDENTS]
Huh?

230
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:14,916
[TOMOMI] Akitsuki, you know
our new student?

231
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,041
No. Not at all.

232
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:18,666
[grunts]

233
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,625
[TOMOMI] Alright.
Well, then, you can take

234
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:22,916
a seat over there,
if that suits you.

235
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,375
[YUU]
Thanks.

236
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:32,333
[STUDENTS chattering]

237
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:33,583
[MALE STUDENT B]
See ya later, man.

238
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:36,000
[MALE STUDENT C]
Yeah, bye, gotta get to club.

239
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:38,958
I'll have to stop by the repair
shop to pay for that loaner.

240
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:40,750
That's gonna hurt.

241
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:42,166
[NACHI]
Come on! Just come with me!

242
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:44,000
[FUUKA]
Would you cut it out, please?

243
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:45,750
Hey, it's not
so bad. You'll see!

244
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:47,458
[FUUKA]
No!

245
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:48,916
What's going on?

246
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,333
I told you, I don't want to!

247
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:52,000
C'mon, don't say that!

248
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:54,166
[FUUKA]
Would you give it up already?

249
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:56,000
[YUU] It's got nothing
to do with me, right?

250
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:58,208
--[FUUKA] I said no!
--[NACHI] Aw, come on!

251
00:12:58,291 --> 00:13:00,041
[FUUKA]
Stop it! Leave me alone!

252
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:03,500
[YUU sighs, grunts]

253
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:05,416
[YUU]
Damn it!

254
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,875
[NACHI chuckles] Come on, now,
just for a little bit.

255
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:09,500
Let go of me, now!

256
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:11,125
[YUU]
Hey!

257
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:18,375
What's up with you?

258
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:21,833
Look, she doesn't wanna go.

259
00:13:21,916 --> 00:13:24,208
I think she's made
that pretty obvious.

260
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:27,291
So, maybe you should leave
her alone now, 'kay?

261
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:29,833
You shouldn't get rough
with girls anyway.

262
00:13:29,916 --> 00:13:32,625
Who's getting rough?

263
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:34,541
[NACHI laughs]
Now I get it!

264
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:35,500
[YUU]
Huh?

265
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:37,166
I wasn't trying to force her.

266
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,916
That was my attempt to recruit
her for the track team.

267
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,750
But she's being
stubborn as hell.

268
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:43,291
[YUU]
Mm. Recruit?

269
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:46,291
Yeah, see, her father is
the great Yamato Akitsuki.

270
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:49,041
He won the silver at the
World Track Tournament?

271
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:51,583
She's what you might call
a rare thoroughbred.

272
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:53,958
She has a lotta talent, too,
but instead of using it,

273
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,916
she wastes every
day goofing off.

274
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,833
Well, it's my life!
I can do what I want!

275
00:13:57,916 --> 00:13:59,666
[NACHI] But it's just so
obvious you should join!

276
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,750
[FUUKA] I have zero interest
in joining the track team!

277
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:03,500
[NACHI] I swear, once you
start, you'll love it.

278
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:06,125
[FUUKA] Do you have to badger
me about this every day?

279
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:09,375
[YUU] 'Kay, bye. Oh, my god.
I'm such an idiot!

280
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:18,416
[YUU groans] So, humiliating.
Why am I such a dork?

281
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,875
[YUU] Grandma always said that
if I saw anyone in trouble,

282
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:23,541
I should help them! That was
drilled into our brains!

283
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:25,083
How about teaching
us to communicate?

284
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:26,875
To ask a person if they
actually need help

285
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:29,083
before I make stupid
assumptions and play "hero"?

286
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:30,583
How about that, Grandma?

287
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:32,541
[FUUKA] Quit ranting
like a lunatic.

288
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:35,166
[YUU gasps]
Great, just great.

289
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,458
Thanks for coming to
witness the meltdown.

290
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:39,041
[FUUKA]
Here.

291
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:41,500
What do you, hey, it's my--

292
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:44,000
Did you keep looking
for this by yourself?

293
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:48,208
Sure, I did. You returned
my CD to me. We're even.

294
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:53,541
[FUUKA exhales]
By the way...

295
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,166
Not that you asked, but my
name is Fuuka Akitsuki.

296
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:00,500
So, you can stop
calling me "you".

297
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,375
[STUDENTS chattering]

298
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:10,458
[MALE STUDENT D] I'm so hungry.
Afternoon P.E. is gonna suck.

299
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:17,333
Great, it's a romance flick.
Of course, it is.

300
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,625
I got free tickets from
one of the regulars,

301
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:22,750
go see it with a
friend or something

302
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:25,000
Easier said than done.

303
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:31,375
[FUUKA] Hey! That movie!
It just opened, didn't it?

304
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:32,958
I should've known it was you.

305
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:36,125
Could you do me a favor and not
shout out of nowhere like that?

306
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:37,750
[FUUKA]
Huh? You're kidding, right?

307
00:15:37,833 --> 00:15:39,750
This is actually me
on a low-key day.

308
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:41,958
Okay, well, that's a
little terrifying.

309
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:44,125
Yeah, anyway. Back to the movie!

310
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:47,083
The theme song's done by
my girl, Koyuki, right?
