00:14:13.102 --> 00:14:15.271
[JIMI]
It's the end of the beginning.

00:14:15.313 --> 00:14:17.648
And the beginning
of something new.

00:14:22.070 --> 00:14:24.364
[JIMI]
The first step is simple.

00:14:24.405 --> 00:14:26.824
You just have to open your ears

00:14:26.866 --> 00:14:29.535
and listen to the color
of your dreams.

00:15:59.959 --> 00:16:00.877
[ECHO]
It's true.

00:16:00.918 --> 00:16:04.046
Nobody knows what
tomorrow will bring, right?

00:16:09.927 --> 00:16:12.513
Where is the Council
Unit's daily report?

00:16:12.555 --> 00:16:13.973
Convocation's at noon.

00:16:14.015 --> 00:16:15.349
[BILIN]
Seems the King of Londinium

00:16:15.391 --> 00:16:17.143
has a lot on his plate.

00:16:18.811 --> 00:16:19.645
To say nothing of the

00:16:19.687 --> 00:16:21.772
Restoration
Committee Chairwoman.

00:16:21.814 --> 00:16:24.442
[BILIN] Hmph. And how's
our country doing?

00:16:24.484 --> 00:16:26.694
[KEVIN] We're finally
getting things sorted out.

00:16:26.736 --> 00:16:29.739
But then, once we've
picked up all the pieces,

00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:31.824
we still have to
find our way forward.

00:16:31.866 --> 00:16:33.367
True.

00:16:33.409 --> 00:16:36.746
Since that day, the relationship
between humanity

00:16:36.787 --> 00:16:39.957
and the Earless has
undergone a drastic change.

00:16:39.999 --> 00:16:42.877
No. Rather, the change
is still ongoing.

00:16:42.919 --> 00:16:44.754
[KEVIN] It took a lot of time
together for those kids

00:16:44.795 --> 00:16:46.881
to finally understand
one another,

00:16:46.923 --> 00:16:49.300
and now the whole world
will have to do the same.

00:16:49.342 --> 00:16:51.594
That's not likely
to happen quickly.

00:16:51.636 --> 00:16:54.305
It's a steep path we walk.

00:16:54.347 --> 00:16:56.307
Ready to hide
in your room again?

00:16:56.349 --> 00:16:59.185
[KEVIN] I find myself yearning
for the outdoors lately.

00:16:59.227 --> 00:17:02.021
In fact. What say we
go on a trip?

00:17:02.063 --> 00:17:03.481
Take some PTO.

00:17:03.523 --> 00:17:05.483
It is a tempting proposition.

00:17:05.525 --> 00:17:09.111
However, this young lady has
some business for you first.

00:17:09.153 --> 00:17:11.239
There's an incoming call
waiting for you.

00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:14.617
Is now a bad time, your majesty?

00:17:14.659 --> 00:17:16.869
Put it through.

00:17:16.911 --> 00:17:18.621
Hey. My apologies.

00:17:18.663 --> 00:17:20.289
I believe I've found
a resolution to

00:17:20.331 --> 00:17:22.750
the immigration question
you brought up.

00:17:22.792 --> 00:17:24.335
And it struck me as
a perfect excuse to

00:17:24.377 --> 00:17:26.671
grant you a bit of
face time with me.

00:17:26.712 --> 00:17:29.173
That's certainly
gracious of you.

00:17:29.215 --> 00:17:30.716
Glad to see you haven't changed.

00:17:30.758 --> 00:17:33.511
Oh, we all change and
there's no helping that.

00:17:33.553 --> 00:17:35.221
But we all fight
those changes, too,

00:17:35.263 --> 00:17:37.181
and that's the gospel truth.

00:17:37.223 --> 00:17:38.975
[KEVIN] One of those
"love" things of yours?

00:17:39.016 --> 00:17:40.977
Ha. I guess you're
finally catching on.

00:17:41.018 --> 00:17:44.355
Excuse me, we're ready to
reactivate the Mesa now.

00:17:44.397 --> 00:17:46.649
Ah, that was quick.

00:17:46.691 --> 00:17:49.402
Huh? Who are those
kids with you?

00:17:49.443 --> 00:17:50.987
So sorry, Denka.

00:17:51.028 --> 00:17:53.239
They snuck in
without permission.

00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:58.619
Hmph. That's fine. Just watch.

00:17:58.661 --> 00:18:02.331
[DENKA sings]

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:09.839
[CROWD cheering]

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:11.841
[LISA]
Denka, it's working perfectly!

00:18:11.882 --> 00:18:14.051
[WENDY]
The Neue Mesa. How beautiful!

00:18:14.093 --> 00:18:15.052
[EARLESS BOY 12B]
That's so cool.

00:18:15.094 --> 00:18:17.430
[EARLESS GIRL 12B]
Oh my gosh, it's amazing!

00:18:19.473 --> 00:18:21.934
It's a fact,
love is all you need.

00:18:21.976 --> 00:18:24.854
And in the end,
love is all we are.

00:18:24.895 --> 00:18:27.607
We learned that from you.

00:18:27.648 --> 00:18:30.151
Didn't we, Jimi?

00:18:33.279 --> 00:18:36.782
[ROZ] The country's become such
a lively place, hasn't it, More?

00:18:36.824 --> 00:18:39.785
[MORE] Yes, Roz, and our
people are truly thriving

00:18:39.827 --> 00:18:41.662
and leading happy lives.

00:18:41.704 --> 00:18:43.289
[ROZ]
To think such a simple sentiment

00:18:43.331 --> 00:18:45.499
could change the
world this much.

00:18:45.541 --> 00:18:46.709
Those two.

00:18:46.751 --> 00:18:48.586
They're really some
remarkable kids.

00:18:48.628 --> 00:18:50.212
Roz.

00:18:50.254 --> 00:18:51.881
By the way, More.

00:18:51.922 --> 00:18:53.716
What are our eccentric
friends doing?

00:18:53.758 --> 00:18:56.886
Right. I think they were
saying something about

00:18:56.927 --> 00:18:58.846
finding a new element of Dada?

00:18:58.888 --> 00:19:02.183
[ROZ chuckles] I can't tell
if they've changed or not.

00:19:02.224 --> 00:19:06.562
[EIN chuckles] With this,
the next element of Dada

00:19:06.604 --> 00:19:08.773
is now practically
within our grasp!

00:19:08.814 --> 00:19:10.066
Now, let's Dada!

00:19:10.107 --> 00:19:11.734
[STUR]
Dear Sister. Emergency!

00:19:11.776 --> 00:19:15.029
[ZENDE] They have come
for Otto Grafplies!

00:19:15.071 --> 00:19:16.030
[STUR gasps]

00:19:16.072 --> 00:19:20.034
[EIN] Stay calm!
All of you. All of us!

00:19:23.371 --> 00:19:25.539
[KIM]
Okay, kids! Everybody.

00:19:25.581 --> 00:19:27.667
Please get back
to your seats now!

00:19:27.708 --> 00:19:28.668
It's a big day.

00:19:28.709 --> 00:19:30.753
We've got two new
transfer students!

00:19:30.795 --> 00:19:31.754
[LYDE, RITCHIE]
Yo.

00:19:31.796 --> 00:19:35.257
Huh? What? No freaking
way! You two?

00:19:35.299 --> 00:19:37.009
I swear, that old bat.

00:19:37.051 --> 00:19:39.011
For some reason or other,
she thought we'd died.

00:19:39.053 --> 00:19:41.389
Yeah, man, talk about awkward.

00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:44.141
Crying over my own
grave was so trippy.

00:19:44.183 --> 00:19:45.935
So there you have it, kids.

00:19:45.976 --> 00:19:48.062
How about a warm welcome
for your new classmates?

00:19:48.104 --> 00:19:49.355
[LYDE, RITCHIE]
What's up, guys?

00:19:49.397 --> 00:19:50.439
Jeez.

00:19:50.481 --> 00:19:51.565
You're such idiots.

00:19:51.607 --> 00:19:53.734
Too dumb to die!

00:19:53.776 --> 00:19:55.986
[MCGEE] Look alive!
Once again, the world

00:19:56.028 --> 00:19:58.614
revolves around our
fair Liverchester.

00:19:58.656 --> 00:20:00.658
The town we live in
is sacred ground

00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:03.035
to people far and wide!

00:20:03.077 --> 00:20:06.747
So lend me your ears and take
these next few words to heart!

00:20:06.789 --> 00:20:08.916
In this world of ours,
if you wanna stay alive,

00:20:08.958 --> 00:20:10.960
there's one thing
that you gotta do.

00:20:11.001 --> 00:20:12.962
Dream on. And don't stop!

00:20:13.003 --> 00:20:15.089
That day we saw
with our own eyes.

00:20:15.131 --> 00:20:16.424
There's no doubt!

00:20:16.465 --> 00:20:19.510
Yeah! And, if you don't
plan on stickin' around,

00:20:19.552 --> 00:20:22.513
you can take a piece
back home with ya!

00:20:22.555 --> 00:20:24.807
[JUNK DEALER 1A] Ugh. That was
a perfect chance for him

00:20:24.849 --> 00:20:25.891
to land a clean shot!

00:20:25.933 --> 00:20:27.476
You're missing the point.

00:20:27.518 --> 00:20:29.812
His execution on that sidestep
just now was flawless.

00:20:29.854 --> 00:20:31.939
Enough with the
commentary, you guys.

00:20:31.981 --> 00:20:33.566
‐‐Miss?
‐‐Welcome!

00:20:33.607 --> 00:20:35.651
Uh. Are you lost, bud?

00:20:35.693 --> 00:20:36.819
You're fine,
but I can't serve you.

00:20:36.861 --> 00:20:39.447
No, but this is Oasis, isn't it?

00:20:39.488 --> 00:20:40.823
It is. Whatcha need?

00:20:40.865 --> 00:20:42.408
Like, the same Oasis where

00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:44.493
that player Echo
used to live, right?

00:20:44.535 --> 00:20:46.829
You bet. Just up
the stairs, in fact.

00:20:46.871 --> 00:20:49.331
[gasps] 'Cause he
locked eyes with me!

00:20:49.373 --> 00:20:50.166
[SWELL]
Really?

[MARSHALL]
Hey, there. Little Squire.

00:20:52.209 --> 00:20:53.753
Uh, yes?

00:20:53.794 --> 00:20:55.296
Matter of fact,

00:20:55.337 --> 00:20:58.048
that young man learned
everything from me.

00:20:58.090 --> 00:21:00.301
Seriously? You must be a genius!

00:21:00.342 --> 00:21:02.720
Wanna hear about it? Well!

00:21:02.762 --> 00:21:05.347
Two drinks, please,
bartender. He's paying.

00:21:05.389 --> 00:21:07.308
Marshall! Do you have any shame?

00:21:07.349 --> 00:21:08.309
[MARSHALL groans]

00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:10.394
Want some juice?
It's on the house.

00:21:10.436 --> 00:21:12.313
[EARLESS BOY 12A]
Thank you, Miss.

00:21:12.354 --> 00:21:13.731
Now, what is it
you want to know?

00:21:13.773 --> 00:21:17.359
So. That day when he
looked me in the eye.

00:21:17.401 --> 00:21:20.488
This weird sound started echoing
through my head all a sudden.

00:21:20.529 --> 00:21:22.198
I gotta know what it was!

00:21:22.239 --> 00:21:23.741

You don't even know that?

Huh?

00:21:24.617 --> 00:21:28.370
[EARLESS GIRL 12A]
Well. If you really wanna know,

00:21:28.412 --> 00:21:29.997

[ECHO]
That's right.

Nobody ever knows
what tomorrow will bring.

00:21:33.918 --> 00:21:36.504
The story of a lifetime
is barely longer

00:21:36.545 --> 00:21:38.589
than the blink of an eye.

00:21:38.631 --> 00:21:42.009
And every story of love
is just "hello" and "goodbye,"

00:21:42.051 --> 00:21:44.553
until the next time
those souls meet.

Nah, dude, you totally do.

You said... that...

Oh, right. You're still
on that, huh?

Sorry, but I can't remember
anything about it.

I don't even know why I got
to be a Player that time.

00:24:13.619 --> 00:24:16.830
[ECHO sighs] I mean the hole
just suddenly showed up.

00:24:16.872 --> 00:24:18.499
Totally gone now.
