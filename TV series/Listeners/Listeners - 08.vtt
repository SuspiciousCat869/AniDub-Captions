WEBVTT

00:00:11.428 --> 00:00:16.016
[ECHO] Whoa! The door just
vanished. That's amazing!

00:00:16.058 --> 00:00:18.477
How does it work?
What do you think?

00:00:22.606 --> 00:00:26.276
[MU] Hm? What's your deal?
You're staring, why?

00:00:26.318 --> 00:00:28.612
What? Oh, uh. No reason.

00:00:28.654 --> 00:00:33.700
Don't be weird. So anyway.
Now we know where to go next.

00:00:33.742 --> 00:00:35.661
[ROZ]
Jimi never reached this country.

00:00:35.702 --> 00:00:37.204
He was likely intercepted.

00:00:37.246 --> 00:00:40.582
And if that's the case,
I think I know who did it.

00:00:40.624 --> 00:00:41.959
Londinium.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.752
[ECHO]
That's right. Londinium!

00:00:43.794 --> 00:00:45.128
Knowing where to go
is one thing,

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.130
but it doesn't make
the trip any shorter.

00:00:47.172 --> 00:00:47.965
Let's get moving.

00:00:48.006 --> 00:00:49.341
[MU]
How long is it?

00:00:49.383 --> 00:00:52.094
[ECHO] Uh. Riding on the
AC Thirty, maybe a week?

00:00:52.135 --> 00:00:55.597
A whole week? Dude, for real?

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:58.475
If we had a plane or something,
it'd be a short flight.

00:00:58.517 --> 00:01:01.770
[MU]
Oh, sure, let me just call one.

00:01:01.812 --> 00:01:03.814
[ECHO]
Wait. What's happening?

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:07.609
[MU]
Did you actually call someone?

00:01:07.651 --> 00:01:09.945
And I'd do that how exactly?

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.033
[MU gasps]

00:01:15.075 --> 00:01:16.368
Hey!

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.496
Your transportation
has arrived, Princess.

00:02:52.756 --> 00:02:55.467
[MU]
Did you call me Princess?

00:02:57.886 --> 00:03:00.722
[ECHO] We flew in eight miles
high, and when we touched down,

00:03:00.764 --> 00:03:04.059
we found a scene stranger
than any we'd known.

00:03:04.101 --> 00:03:07.062
[KIDS laughing]

00:03:07.104 --> 00:03:08.313
[BOY 8A]
Welcome home, Sally!

00:03:08.355 --> 00:03:09.147
[GIRL 8A]
Welcome back!

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:11.817
[BOY 8B] Where's our souvenirs?
You brought us some, didn't you?

00:03:11.858 --> 00:03:14.820
Whoa. Is this place...?

00:03:14.861 --> 00:03:16.571
[SALLY] Londinium is
the current frontline

00:03:16.613 --> 00:03:18.699
in humankind's war
with the Earless.

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:20.283
The fighting here
is much fiercer

00:03:20.325 --> 00:03:22.994
and more frequent
than in any other region.

00:03:23.036 --> 00:03:24.788
Right. Back to work, you guys!

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:25.956
[KIDS]
Okay.

00:03:25.997 --> 00:03:28.583
This tower sees
the worst of it all.

00:03:28.625 --> 00:03:31.461
We call it the Watchtower,
mankind's final bastion

00:03:31.503 --> 00:03:33.505
against the Earless onslaught.

00:03:34.423 --> 00:03:38.093
And I'm the XO of the
Council Unit. Sally Simpson.

00:03:38.135 --> 00:03:40.762
I look after this stronghold,
as well as those children.

00:03:40.804 --> 00:03:42.097
Any questions, then?

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:46.893
Uh. So, Mu, the girl who
rode with us on the helicopter.

00:03:46.935 --> 00:03:48.645
Where did she go?

00:03:50.021 --> 00:03:53.734
She's up there, meeting with
our commander at HQ.

00:03:53.775 --> 00:03:55.610
His name is Tommy Walker.

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.739
[TOMMY]
Welcome to our stronghold,

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.325
humanity's last,
best hope. Princess.

00:04:02.367 --> 00:04:03.994
First off, can you
tell me why you've been

00:04:04.035 --> 00:04:06.496
calling me "Princess"
this whole time?

00:04:08.665 --> 00:04:11.877
Beg your pardon, but I thought
that you would know already.

00:04:11.918 --> 00:04:14.463
Jimi Stonefree saved us,
and by all accounts,

00:04:14.504 --> 00:04:16.339
you're his younger sister.

00:04:16.381 --> 00:04:19.509
That alone makes you worthy
of a warm welcome.

00:04:19.551 --> 00:04:23.513
That's what I figured.
Can I ask you a few more?

00:04:23.555 --> 00:04:24.514
Yes, of course.

00:04:24.556 --> 00:04:26.600
After the Fest failed
ten years ago,

00:04:26.641 --> 00:04:29.561
Jimi was brought
back here, right?

00:04:29.603 --> 00:04:32.439
So, if your people
picked him up,

00:04:32.481 --> 00:04:35.066
what happened to him afterwards?

00:04:35.108 --> 00:04:37.235
[ACE]
It's quite the sad story.

00:04:37.277 --> 00:04:39.821
And I should be
the one to tell it.

00:04:39.863 --> 00:04:41.364
Field Marshal Ace.

00:04:43.825 --> 00:04:46.953
The fact of the matter is,
we failed your poor brother.

00:04:46.995 --> 00:04:47.829
Huh?

00:04:47.871 --> 00:04:49.998
[ACE] Could we take this
somewhere else?

00:04:51.166 --> 00:04:53.877
[ACE] Before I was confined
to this contraption,

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:57.422
I piloted Equipment
for the Londinium army.

00:04:57.464 --> 00:05:00.342
Ten years ago,
Jimi had his final gig,

00:05:00.383 --> 00:05:02.886
and as fate would
have it, I was there.

00:05:04.554 --> 00:05:07.849
[ACE] Our plan, Project Freedom,
was well underway.

00:05:07.891 --> 00:05:09.684
Its aim was to
eliminate the Earless

00:05:09.726 --> 00:05:12.103
from this world in one stroke.

00:05:12.145 --> 00:05:15.482
And Jimi Stonefree
was our trump card.

00:05:16.483 --> 00:05:18.860
[ACE] He rode into the
swarm of Earless alone,

00:05:18.902 --> 00:05:20.904
just as we had asked of him.

00:05:20.946 --> 00:05:22.280
And he tore through them,

00:05:22.322 --> 00:05:25.575
fighting like some
kind of avenging spirit.

00:05:25.617 --> 00:05:27.577
At that moment,
we all believed that

00:05:27.619 --> 00:05:29.621
victory was within his grasp.

00:05:29.663 --> 00:05:31.456
But then. in an instant,

00:05:31.498 --> 00:05:35.043
something seemed
to change inside him.

00:05:35.085 --> 00:05:37.546
To this day, I don't know what.

00:05:41.967 --> 00:05:44.511
[ACE]
He suddenly ceased his attack.

00:05:56.481 --> 00:05:58.483
[ACE]
And disappeared beyond the gate.

00:05:58.525 --> 00:06:01.278
Then you're saying
Jimi Stonefree,

00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:03.280
my big brother, died that day?

00:06:03.321 --> 00:06:05.615
I'm not. Jimi is still alive.

00:06:05.657 --> 00:06:06.575
Huh?

00:06:07.701 --> 00:06:12.330
Indeed. And to this day, he
roams somewhere beyond the gate.

00:06:12.372 --> 00:06:14.332
That is what we believe.

00:06:15.959 --> 00:06:18.879
[MU] What's all this?
You prepping for something?

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:20.630
[TOMMY]
Our Christmas festivities.

00:06:20.672 --> 00:06:21.882
One week from today.

00:06:21.923 --> 00:06:24.342
This is where we're
staging the performance.

00:06:24.384 --> 00:06:25.594
[MU]
Performance?

00:06:25.635 --> 00:06:27.220
[TOMMY]
Yes. A theatrical tribute

00:06:27.262 --> 00:06:29.556
to the life and accomplishments
of Jimi Stonefree,

00:06:29.598 --> 00:06:31.933
with the man himself
as the protagonist.

00:06:31.975 --> 00:06:33.685
Is there a reason for that?

00:06:33.727 --> 00:06:37.898
At the climax of the play,
Jimi will disappear.

00:06:37.939 --> 00:06:40.692
Just as he vanished beyond
the gate after the Fest,

00:06:40.734 --> 00:06:42.485
and that will be
our pivotal moment.

00:06:42.527 --> 00:06:45.947
For ten years, without rest,
we've been searching

00:06:45.989 --> 00:06:49.159
for a way to call Jimi back
across the gate to us.

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:53.246
And we believe that now,
we've finally found the answer.

00:06:53.288 --> 00:06:56.166
This is why we invited
you to our country.

00:06:56.207 --> 00:06:59.544
Princess. The plan
will not work without you.

00:06:59.586 --> 00:07:02.380
So please, be our
Jimi next week.

00:07:02.422 --> 00:07:03.298
[MU]
Seriously?

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:05.926
On this stage,
we will recreate the conditions

00:07:05.967 --> 00:07:08.553
of Jimi's disappearance
ten years ago.

00:07:08.595 --> 00:07:11.723
In that moment, we'll
activate his Duel Showman,

00:07:11.765 --> 00:07:13.308
and open the gate.

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:16.770
And at last, he will
join us once again.

00:07:16.811 --> 00:07:18.980
I have faith that he'll return.

00:07:19.022 --> 00:07:21.107
You're his younger sister.

00:07:21.149 --> 00:07:22.776
We could search
the whole world over

00:07:22.817 --> 00:07:25.612
and never find a more
perfect candidate.

00:07:25.654 --> 00:07:28.782
After ten years we've found
a way to bring Jimi back.

00:07:28.823 --> 00:07:30.909
And if you help us out,

00:07:30.951 --> 00:07:33.370
he'll surely reveal
your true name to you.

00:07:33.411 --> 00:07:34.454
[gasps]

00:07:34.496 --> 00:07:37.248
[TOMMY] At long last,
you'll finally solve the mystery

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:39.000
of who you really are.

00:07:44.047 --> 00:07:50.679
[alarm ringing]

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:53.848
[MU] Still not much of a
morning person, are you, Echo?

00:07:55.266 --> 00:07:56.685
[ECHO]
Hey, Mu.

00:08:02.107 --> 00:08:04.818
[ECHO]
That night. She said this.

00:08:05.986 --> 00:08:09.406
[ECHO] Mu! I started thinking
you weren't gonna come back!

00:08:09.447 --> 00:08:10.657
[MU]
Yeah.

00:08:14.661 --> 00:08:18.665
[ECHO] What's up? Did you find
out anything new about Jimi?

00:08:18.707 --> 00:08:21.501
That is why we
came here. I suppose.

00:08:21.543 --> 00:08:24.087
What? Is it not? I thought‐‐

00:08:24.129 --> 00:08:28.717
[MU] Echo. You wanna meet him
no matter what happens?

00:08:28.758 --> 00:08:33.054
Well, yeah. I do. Of course.
To ask him about you.

00:08:33.096 --> 00:08:34.973
Who you are and
where you come from.

00:08:35.015 --> 00:08:38.935
We can't let the journey end
until that's done, right?

00:08:38.977 --> 00:08:43.023
[MU]
Sure. But then, in the end,

00:08:43.064 --> 00:08:45.734
I may not be the kind of
person you think I am.

00:08:45.775 --> 00:08:48.778
[ECHO] What's that mean?
You're still Mu.

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:51.156
And whatever kind of
person you really are,

00:08:51.197 --> 00:08:52.699
I wanna find out.

00:08:52.741 --> 00:08:56.494
Because no matter what,
I know I'm on your side.

00:08:58.413 --> 00:08:59.414
Here.

00:09:01.416 --> 00:09:02.709
What is this?

00:09:02.751 --> 00:09:04.419
It's the script for
the Christmas pageant

00:09:04.461 --> 00:09:05.670
they're gonna do.

00:09:05.712 --> 00:09:07.047
Their commander Tommy was all,

00:09:07.088 --> 00:09:09.132
"Would you please be our Jimi?"

00:09:09.174 --> 00:09:10.550
Laid it on real thick.

00:09:10.592 --> 00:09:12.260
Tommy. Yeah.

00:09:12.302 --> 00:09:14.554
He's the good‐looking
one. Oh crap!

00:09:14.596 --> 00:09:17.182
Is that why he's been calling
you Princess this whole time?

00:09:17.223 --> 00:09:19.768
And I wasn't sure I wanted to.

00:09:19.809 --> 00:09:21.603
But. I decided.

00:09:21.644 --> 00:09:24.355
I'm in. Time to make my debut.

00:09:24.397 --> 00:09:25.356
Uh‐‐

00:09:26.191 --> 00:09:28.902
[ECHO] And so, for the week
leading up to Christmas,

00:09:28.943 --> 00:09:32.489
we found ourselves living here
in Londinium's Watchtower.

00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:35.366
According to Mu,
Jimi Stonefree himself

00:09:35.408 --> 00:09:37.911
is going to appear on
Christmas night. But‐‐

00:09:37.952 --> 00:09:41.247
[MU] Hey! Rehearsal
is starting like, now.

00:09:41.289 --> 00:09:43.166
How long are you
trying to sleep?

00:09:47.587 --> 00:09:51.674
[ECHO] Have I ever seen anything
like her in that blue dress?

00:09:51.716 --> 00:09:53.843
And her face is
a speck of white,

00:09:53.885 --> 00:09:54.761
like a sail against the sky.

00:09:54.803 --> 00:09:55.762
[MU]
What is it?

00:09:55.804 --> 00:09:56.930
[gasps]

00:09:58.973 --> 00:10:01.434
So this is what they're
gonna have me wear.

00:10:01.476 --> 00:10:02.560
I look silly, right?

00:10:02.602 --> 00:10:06.981
Wha? No! Seriously!
It's really...

00:10:07.023 --> 00:10:10.985
It's, uh... It's
really... I think...

00:10:11.027 --> 00:10:13.655
Dude, you're so weird.

00:10:13.696 --> 00:10:14.948
But I guess it would be weirder

00:10:14.989 --> 00:10:17.158
if you were normal
all of a sudden.

00:10:18.076 --> 00:10:20.787
[sighs] It wasn't
that weird, was it?

00:10:20.829 --> 00:10:22.747
I thought I was
about like usual.

00:10:22.789 --> 00:10:24.290
[MARSHALL] Well you may
not have realized it,

00:10:24.332 --> 00:10:25.959
but you're usually
pretty weird, kid.

00:10:25.959 --> 00:10:29.629
Really, think so?
Uh‐‐ Mr. Marshall?

00:10:29.671 --> 00:10:30.505
Hey.

00:10:30.547 --> 00:10:31.631
Why are you here?

00:10:31.673 --> 00:10:33.299
'Cause the Londinium
military's got

00:10:33.341 --> 00:10:35.343
part‐timers in need of bossin',

00:10:35.385 --> 00:10:37.971
and the traveling foreman
is in need of some work.

00:10:38.012 --> 00:10:40.765
What's up with those idle
hands of yours, Echo?

00:10:40.807 --> 00:10:42.433
Aren't you supposed
to be finishing up

00:10:42.475 --> 00:10:43.852
the maintenance by
the end of the day?

00:10:43.893 --> 00:10:46.271
Uh‐‐ Yeah!

00:10:46.312 --> 00:10:47.605
They put me in charge
of maintenance

00:10:47.647 --> 00:10:49.315
for the general‐
purpose Equipment.

00:10:49.357 --> 00:10:51.776
Apparently they're
using them as props.

00:10:51.818 --> 00:10:53.778
These things have been
around for a while, though.

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:55.405
Oh? Lemme take a look.

00:10:55.446 --> 00:10:56.489
Ah. Sure.

00:10:56.531 --> 00:10:57.448
[MARSHALL]
Hmm.

00:10:57.490 --> 00:11:00.034
[ECHO] So. There I was,
messing with the oldest amps

00:11:00.076 --> 00:11:03.204
I'd ever seen. And Mu...

00:11:03.246 --> 00:11:06.082
[MU] Now, let our voices
ring out together!

00:11:06.124 --> 00:11:09.919
If we open our hearts,
images will be revealed to us.

00:11:09.961 --> 00:11:11.254
And if we close our eyes,

00:11:11.296 --> 00:11:13.590
then we shall find out
where we've come from.

00:11:13.631 --> 00:11:15.341
Of this I am certain.

00:11:15.383 --> 00:11:17.135
[KIDS humming]

00:11:17.177 --> 00:11:18.219
[gasps]

00:11:18.261 --> 00:11:23.266
[KIDS humming]

00:11:27.103 --> 00:11:33.151
[ALL humming]

00:11:40.158 --> 00:11:41.701
That's a wrap for today.

00:11:41.743 --> 00:11:43.912
Everyone make sure to
keep practicing your parts

00:11:43.953 --> 00:11:46.372
once you get back to
your rooms. Dismissed.

00:11:46.414 --> 00:11:47.874
[KIDS]
Okay!

00:11:49.792 --> 00:11:51.044
Wait a sec.

00:11:51.085 --> 00:11:51.961
All right?

00:11:52.003 --> 00:11:55.215
What was that sound we made,
that mm‐hmm‐hmm, thing?

00:11:55.256 --> 00:11:56.633
[GIRL 8B]
Hmm‐hmm thing?

00:11:56.674 --> 00:11:59.010
‐‐Yeah.
‐‐What. You don't know?

00:11:59.052 --> 00:12:01.387
‐‐[MU] Hey.
‐‐Every Player knows that song.

00:12:01.429 --> 00:12:03.014
We all have it
playing inside our heads

00:12:03.056 --> 00:12:05.934
from the moment we're born!
Mister Tommy told us so.

00:12:05.975 --> 00:12:06.935
Did he, now?

00:12:06.976 --> 00:12:09.479
Yeah, miss! You were
singing along, too!

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:11.522
Huh, that's true.

00:12:11.564 --> 00:12:13.399
I've known it for as
long as I can remember,

00:12:13.441 --> 00:12:14.692
but I thought it was just me.

00:12:14.734 --> 00:12:18.446
[GIRL 8B giggles]
Hey, miss, what's your name?

00:12:18.488 --> 00:12:19.489
[MU]
It's Mu.

00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:22.659
Wow. You've got a weird name!

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:24.911
[MU]
Huh? Where are your manners?

00:12:24.953 --> 00:12:29.123
[GIRL 8B]
Mu! Mu! That's so weird!

00:12:30.792 --> 00:12:33.169
Is it a weird name?

00:12:33.211 --> 00:12:34.879
[MU]
So what if it is?

00:12:34.921 --> 00:12:38.216
Echo gave it to me,
and I treasure it.

00:12:44.013 --> 00:12:45.348
[MU]
I never asked you.

00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:48.351
What do you actually plan on
doing when you meet Jimi?

00:12:48.393 --> 00:12:51.646
Gotta think about that. Huh.

00:12:51.688 --> 00:12:53.564
Get his autograph, I guess?

00:12:53.606 --> 00:12:55.024
What?

00:12:55.066 --> 00:12:56.526
That's not weird, is it?

00:12:56.567 --> 00:13:01.030
Yeah, it is. But then,
you usually are kinda weird.

00:13:01.072 --> 00:13:02.699
Heh. I might be.

00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:05.034
Old man Marshall said
pretty much the same thing.

00:13:05.076 --> 00:13:08.037
Same old Echo,
but you have changed a bit.

00:13:08.079 --> 00:13:08.997
How's that work?

00:13:09.038 --> 00:13:11.332
[MU laughs]
Oh, yeah.

00:13:11.374 --> 00:13:13.376
Could I get you to help me out
with something today?

00:13:13.418 --> 00:13:15.336
Uh, help you out with what?

00:13:15.378 --> 00:13:17.839
Getting off book. Take this.

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:19.299
[ECHO]
Yeah, fine.

00:13:21.259 --> 00:13:22.635
[ECHO]
Hmm.

00:13:25.555 --> 00:13:28.266
Hey, hold up.
Why does it stop there?

00:13:28.308 --> 00:13:29.309
[MU]
Oh, right.

00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:31.644
They told us we're doing
the ending on the fly.

00:13:31.686 --> 00:13:32.687
Like, improv?

00:13:32.729 --> 00:13:34.397
Hey, I'm not mad at it!

00:13:34.439 --> 00:13:37.191
I feel like I've gotten pretty
good at wingin' it, right?

00:13:37.233 --> 00:13:38.776
True enough. Wait.

00:13:38.818 --> 00:13:41.571
You can't just hop on the AC
thirty and start punchin' stuff!

00:13:41.612 --> 00:13:45.825
[MU laughs]
Yeah. Anyway.

00:13:45.867 --> 00:13:50.163
Deep inside of me
is a part that loves somebody.

00:13:50.204 --> 00:13:51.998
Who's always by my side.

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:54.125
Who always has my back.

00:13:55.043 --> 00:13:55.835
[MU]
Your line.

00:13:55.877 --> 00:13:58.087
Wha‐‐ Uh, my bad.

00:13:58.129 --> 00:14:00.006
Get it together, man!

00:14:01.758 --> 00:14:04.844
Sickness and sorrow
and separation.

00:14:04.886 --> 00:14:07.430
Even as the world
falls apart around us,

00:14:07.472 --> 00:14:09.474
there's one thing I know.

00:14:09.515 --> 00:14:11.517
I know that I love you.

00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:15.396
[ECHO sighs]

00:14:15.438 --> 00:14:17.023
That was one heavy sigh.

00:14:17.065 --> 00:14:19.484
Like the weight of the
world's on your shoulders.

00:14:19.525 --> 00:14:21.402
So? What's up, kid?

00:14:21.444 --> 00:14:22.653
Oh, it's just...

00:14:22.695 --> 00:14:25.865
Mu asked me earlier
about what I'll do

00:14:25.907 --> 00:14:28.284
when we finally
meet Jimi, and...

00:14:28.326 --> 00:14:30.536
Well, it caught me a
little bit off guard, y'know?

00:14:30.578 --> 00:14:31.537
[MARSHALL laughs]

00:14:31.579 --> 00:14:34.665
C'mon, Mr. Marshall,
don't laugh at me!

00:14:34.707 --> 00:14:36.793
I know, I know, sorry.

00:14:36.834 --> 00:14:39.087
But it's a pretty
obvious question.

00:14:39.128 --> 00:14:41.464
Once ya meet Jimi,
your journey's over,

00:14:41.506 --> 00:14:43.883
so ya got no reason
to stick with her.

00:14:43.925 --> 00:14:44.759
Do you?

00:14:44.801 --> 00:14:47.303
Huh. Yeah, I guess.

00:14:47.345 --> 00:14:49.055
I hadn't thought
about it like that.

00:14:49.097 --> 00:14:51.849
[MARSHALL] I swear, son,
a deaf, dumb, and blind kid

00:14:51.891 --> 00:14:54.185
woulda caught on
quicker. Speakin' of.

00:14:54.227 --> 00:14:56.020
Don't you have anything
you wanna say to her

00:14:56.062 --> 00:14:58.940
before this journey's over?
Anything at all?

00:14:58.981 --> 00:15:01.442
Not really. I mean,

00:15:01.484 --> 00:15:04.904
as long as Mu gets to
meet Jimi, then we're good.

00:15:04.946 --> 00:15:05.822
Hm?

00:15:05.863 --> 00:15:08.449
You can't let all of your
thoughts stay in your head.

00:15:08.491 --> 00:15:10.201
Sometimes you gotta
turn 'em into words

00:15:10.243 --> 00:15:12.703
to get things
moving along again.

00:15:12.745 --> 00:15:15.665
That's the way we
get by in the world.

00:15:15.706 --> 00:15:16.582
Right.

00:15:16.624 --> 00:15:20.128
If you can't find the words,
you gotta take a look in here.

00:15:20.169 --> 00:15:21.629
And you better
figure it out quick!

00:15:21.671 --> 00:15:22.463
Ah!

00:15:22.505 --> 00:15:24.340
Man up and get it done, got it?

00:15:24.382 --> 00:15:25.508
Yeah.

00:15:29.011 --> 00:15:33.641
[ECHO] He's right. This is
what I should've told her.

00:15:33.683 --> 00:15:36.394
Even if you were
to stop being "Mu,"

00:15:36.436 --> 00:15:39.897
it wouldn't change
the person you are.

00:15:39.939 --> 00:15:42.108
And if I just kept
calling you Mu,

00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:44.819
nothing would have
changed at all.

00:15:44.861 --> 00:15:47.655
Then Christmas finally came.

00:15:47.697 --> 00:15:51.909
And the curtain rose on the
first act of the new world.

00:15:54.495 --> 00:15:56.497
Oh! Echo!

00:15:56.539 --> 00:15:58.499
You're looking
a little pale there.

00:15:58.541 --> 00:16:00.042
Everything good?

00:16:00.084 --> 00:16:01.210
I'm not sure.

00:16:01.252 --> 00:16:05.423
I look at my reflection and
I see someone else's face.

00:16:06.799 --> 00:16:09.260
I know you'll do great!

00:16:09.302 --> 00:16:10.094
Hey, Mu?

00:16:10.136 --> 00:16:10.970
[MU]
What?

00:16:11.012 --> 00:16:14.307
When the show is over,
could we talk for a second?

00:16:14.348 --> 00:16:16.434
[MU]
Yeah, I'd be fine with that.

00:16:16.476 --> 00:16:17.727
Thank you.

00:16:17.768 --> 00:16:20.021
You're going on in
30 seconds, miss.

00:16:20.062 --> 00:16:22.315
Cool. I should
head back to my seat.

00:16:22.356 --> 00:16:24.108
[MU]
Wait. Echo!

00:16:26.319 --> 00:16:27.445
My pendant.

00:16:27.487 --> 00:16:29.864
Uh, what's up?

00:16:29.906 --> 00:16:32.533
[MU]
Hold on to it. No matter what.

00:16:33.618 --> 00:16:35.203
'Kay. See ya.

00:16:35.244 --> 00:16:36.245
Mu!

00:16:44.962 --> 00:16:47.548
The sun turns in the
corners of our eyes.

00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:52.845
Gracefully. Driven by a
soft explosion, we set off.

00:16:52.887 --> 00:16:56.098
Bound for a star
awash in fiery oceans.

00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:59.894
A voyage so long,
and so very lonely.

00:16:59.936 --> 00:17:01.521
There you are.

00:17:01.562 --> 00:17:05.233
A hundred light years from home,
drifting in solitude!

00:17:06.526 --> 00:17:07.985
[MU]
On our journey.

00:17:08.027 --> 00:17:10.571
From time to time,
I've asked myself.

00:17:10.613 --> 00:17:12.240
"Who are you?"

00:17:12.281 --> 00:17:13.866
The thoughts come and go.

00:17:15.076 --> 00:17:16.702
[MU]
How did I get here?

00:17:16.744 --> 00:17:19.497
Where will I end up when
it's all said and done?

00:17:20.581 --> 00:17:23.251
[MU] Then I usually try to
push those questions aside

00:17:23.292 --> 00:17:25.378
and forget I'd ever had them.

00:17:26.796 --> 00:17:31.467
[MU] But, they're always in
my head, hiding in the shadows.

00:17:33.469 --> 00:17:37.348
[MU]
Today, all that comes to an end.

00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:39.058
Because Jimi...

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:43.145
My big brother is coming
back across the gate!

00:17:45.189 --> 00:17:49.151
Deep inside of me
is a part that loves somebody.

00:17:49.193 --> 00:17:53.114
Who's always by my side,
who always lifts me up.

00:17:54.407 --> 00:17:58.202
[MU] Sickness and sorrow
and separation.

00:17:58.244 --> 00:18:01.247
Even as the world
falls apart around us.

00:18:01.289 --> 00:18:04.000
Still. There's one thing I know.

00:18:04.041 --> 00:18:04.917
I know that I love you.

00:18:04.959 --> 00:18:07.503
A pack of Earless
has begun to gather.

00:18:07.545 --> 00:18:09.422
All has gone to plan.

00:18:09.463 --> 00:18:11.215
We finally found the
last thing we needed

00:18:11.257 --> 00:18:13.467
to bring Jimi back to us.

00:18:13.509 --> 00:18:18.014
That girl. The closest thing
to him left in this world.

00:18:18.055 --> 00:18:20.891
But something close
is hardly enough.

00:18:20.933 --> 00:18:23.394
What we really need
is for her to become

00:18:23.436 --> 00:18:26.188
the incarnation of Jimi himself.

00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:27.857
[SALLY]
Yes, Commander.

00:18:33.279 --> 00:18:35.823
That was more than we
could have hoped for, Princess!

00:18:35.865 --> 00:18:36.949
Thanks, Tommy.

00:18:36.991 --> 00:18:37.825
Please take these.

00:18:37.867 --> 00:18:38.951
Yeah, got it.

00:18:38.993 --> 00:18:41.245
Now, this is the final act!

00:18:41.287 --> 00:18:43.372
You're writing the
show from here on!

00:18:43.414 --> 00:18:46.083
All of you, give it
everything you've got!

00:18:50.338 --> 00:18:53.049
Princess. It's time.

00:18:53.090 --> 00:18:55.384
It looks like your nerves
are getting to you.

00:18:55.426 --> 00:18:57.178
Like hell‐‐

00:18:57.219 --> 00:18:59.680
[MU coughing]

00:18:59.722 --> 00:19:02.433
Stop that! What're you‐‐

00:19:02.475 --> 00:19:06.020
Now, it's time for
your big scene.

00:19:12.777 --> 00:19:16.113
When this is over,
can I really meet him?

00:19:16.155 --> 00:19:20.326
I'm so sorry. You're not
going to see Jimi.

00:19:25.539 --> 00:19:28.918
No, rather, you'll be him.

00:19:28.959 --> 00:19:29.960
Don't!

00:19:41.347 --> 00:19:45.559
[MU] All along the watchtower,
princes kept the view.

00:19:45.601 --> 00:19:47.895
Watching the women come and go.

00:19:47.937 --> 00:19:49.980
With their barefoot servants.

00:19:50.022 --> 00:19:52.817
A wildcat growled
in the far distance.

00:19:52.858 --> 00:19:54.026
[MU gasps]

00:19:56.404 --> 00:19:58.322
[MU]
Suddenly,

00:19:58.364 --> 00:20:02.201
I was there. Project Freedom.

00:20:02.243 --> 00:20:04.412
The night of the Fest.

00:20:04.453 --> 00:20:07.581
That was when I understood.

00:20:07.623 --> 00:20:09.500
They were my friends.

00:20:09.542 --> 00:20:13.087
I was an outsider,
sent from their world to ours.

00:20:13.129 --> 00:20:15.131
I was one of them.

00:20:15.172 --> 00:20:18.134
Yes. I was an Earless.

00:20:18.175 --> 00:20:22.221
One of those selected from among
them to be reborn as a human.

00:20:22.263 --> 00:20:23.931
As a Player.

00:20:23.973 --> 00:20:26.559
Everything finally made sense.

00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:29.729
The loneliness that
had always plagued me.

00:20:29.770 --> 00:20:34.066
The feeling that nobody around
me would ever understand me.

00:20:34.108 --> 00:20:37.695
After that,
I knew what it meant.

00:20:38.612 --> 00:20:39.947
[EIN]
You feel it, too, don't you?

00:20:39.989 --> 00:20:42.616
That element of ruin
flows within your body,

00:20:42.658 --> 00:20:44.285
a piece of him inside you.

00:20:44.326 --> 00:20:45.870
At the end of the day,
being a Player

00:20:45.911 --> 00:20:47.288
means losing your mind.

00:20:47.329 --> 00:20:48.497
That's just how it is.

00:20:48.539 --> 00:20:50.791
No matter how much we
prayed for leniency,

00:20:50.833 --> 00:20:53.085
something was
eventually going to give.

00:20:53.127 --> 00:20:55.087
Who are you really?

00:20:55.129 --> 00:20:56.297
[gasps]

00:20:57.381 --> 00:21:00.593
[MU screams]

00:21:03.012 --> 00:21:04.472
Mu, no!

00:21:19.862 --> 00:21:21.155
[NIR]
Lyde!

00:21:24.366 --> 00:21:25.576
[gasps]

00:21:49.433 --> 00:21:51.769
[SALLY] The situation
has been resolved.

00:21:51.811 --> 00:21:55.022
[TOMMY] I once heard it said,
by a certain man,

00:21:55.064 --> 00:21:56.941
that all you need is love.

00:21:58.067 --> 00:22:00.110
And to that, I say...

00:22:00.152 --> 00:22:03.364
If love is all we need,
then let it rule over all.

00:22:03.405 --> 00:22:07.535
[ACE] Tommy! What is this?
What do you think you're doing?

00:22:08.410 --> 00:22:10.162
How do you mean, Field Marshal?

00:22:10.204 --> 00:22:12.873
Plan's gone flawlessly,
as you can see.

00:22:12.915 --> 00:22:14.375
But you told me
that your plan was

00:22:14.416 --> 00:22:16.585
to bring Jimi back
into our world!

00:22:16.627 --> 00:22:20.214
Indeed. He is with us once more.

00:22:20.256 --> 00:22:21.715
In a new vessel.

00:22:21.757 --> 00:22:24.385
Armed even more
formidably than before.

00:22:25.511 --> 00:22:27.263
[TOMMY]
A substitute, yes.

00:22:27.304 --> 00:22:30.307
But sure to be of
use to us, even so.

00:22:30.349 --> 00:22:32.351
[ACE]
This is madness.

00:22:32.393 --> 00:22:36.814
And in due time,
all shall be as love dictates.

00:24:12.242 --> 00:24:14.578
[JIMI] Everyone says
that all you need is love.

00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:17.498
But love is not enough for us.

00:24:17.539 --> 00:24:21.085
That's why we need to
make our hearts even bigger.

00:24:21.126 --> 00:24:25.297
Freedom. Open your eyes
wide to the Player's awakening.
