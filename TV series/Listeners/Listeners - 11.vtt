Something wrong?

00:03:16.947 --> 00:03:18.782
I'm hearing a bit of
commotion out there.

00:03:18.824 --> 00:03:20.158
[NIR]
It's the Earless.

[NIR gasps]

00:03:26.331 --> 00:03:30.001
On that day, when you showed up
injured at my doorstep.

00:03:30.043 --> 00:03:32.421
The first thought that
popped into my head

00:03:32.462 --> 00:03:36.341
was those two fools
had come back somehow.

00:03:36.383 --> 00:03:41.346
But even just seeing you
alive made me so happy, Nir.

[RESERVOIR] Where's the report
from the advance party?

Stay on top of it, a'right?

00:03:44.641 --> 00:03:46.184
So that's how it is.

00:03:46.226 --> 00:03:49.604
Tommy arranged a coup and took
control of the army from Ace.

00:03:49.646 --> 00:03:51.064
He planned to use the Earless to

00:03:51.106 --> 00:03:54.317
bring the world under
Londinium's rule. Except...

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:56.027
He failed to realize
that he would summon

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:58.947
Listeners, king of the Earless.

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:02.075
And in seven days, she'll be
back to wipe the slate clean.

00:04:02.117 --> 00:04:03.577
That's right.

00:04:03.618 --> 00:04:06.371

become of dear Tommy?

[DENKA sighs]
I'm so sorry to hear that.

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.599
We don't have any intention
of enslaving anyone,

and we're sure as hell not gonna
be anybody's slaves either.

00:04:29.311 --> 00:04:32.606
No man's rule can
bring us salvation.

00:04:32.647 --> 00:04:35.275
Love, and only love,
will save us all.

00:04:37.152 --> 00:04:39.905
A traitor planted the
seeds of this conflict.

00:04:39.946 --> 00:04:42.616
But even so, we must stop it.

00:04:44.576 --> 00:04:47.287
[DENKA] We're facing
a test of love, everybody!

00:04:47.329 --> 00:04:50.874
So let's prove it's so bright
it glows from inside us!

[EIN] The chaos surrounding

00:05:02.636 --> 00:05:03.845
And perhaps.

It was fate that we three

For love to be our salvation.

00:05:25.492 --> 00:05:28.620

00:05:28.662 --> 00:05:31.331

And yet, even this.

00:05:31.373 --> 00:05:35.377
[ZENDE] Is hardly so
terrible, is it, Dear Sister?

space enough for everyone.

Excuse me, Denka.

an old friend of yours

00:06:24.885 --> 00:06:27.429
has come to see you. Wait!

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:28.930
An old friend?

00:06:28.972 --> 00:06:29.973
[DENKA groans]

00:06:31.892 --> 00:06:33.059
Damn you!

00:06:33.977 --> 00:06:37.230
It's been some time,
Your Purple Majesty.

00:06:37.272 --> 00:06:38.773
The Princess of Gnome.

00:06:38.815 --> 00:06:40.525
This is quite unexpected.

00:06:40.567 --> 00:06:43.028
I'm honored that you
would still remember me.

00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:45.530
It's been so long
since you came to visit.

00:06:45.572 --> 00:06:49.034
That little girl you knew is all
grown up now. As you can see.

00:06:53.288 --> 00:06:55.290
More to the point,
I don't know if I believe this

00:06:55.332 --> 00:06:57.751
display of benevolence
comes from the heart.

00:06:57.792 --> 00:07:01.046
[DENKA] Hm. Think what you
like about my motives,

00:07:01.087 --> 00:07:02.964
but don't expect me to stop.

00:07:03.006 --> 00:07:05.425
Understood. And for your part,

00:07:05.467 --> 00:07:07.844
don't think this
atones for your crimes.

00:07:07.886 --> 00:07:09.888
Anyway. I didn't
come here to settle

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:11.723
my country's accounts with you.

00:07:11.765 --> 00:07:14.601
Is that so? Here to
help save the world?

00:07:14.643 --> 00:07:15.894
Not at all.

00:07:15.936 --> 00:07:18.772
I say if the world means
to end, then let it.

00:07:18.813 --> 00:07:20.649
These countries are
none of my concern,

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:22.108
and frankly it
wouldn't bother me

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:25.028
to see the Earless
tear them all down.

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:26.780
But a friend of mine is in need.

00:07:26.821 --> 00:07:27.864
A friend, huh?

00:07:27.906 --> 00:07:30.241
Yes. And quite an odd one.

00:07:30.283 --> 00:07:33.328
A person with no history
and no identity.

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:35.413
No fear or doubt, either.

00:07:35.455 --> 00:07:38.959
And yet, she just can't
bear to be left alone.

00:07:40.043 --> 00:07:43.004
It seems she's started
going by "Listeners."

00:07:43.046 --> 00:07:47.384
But I still owe her a
great deal, and she's lost.

00:07:47.425 --> 00:07:51.221
I can kind of see her,
caught inside a cage,

00:07:51.262 --> 00:07:53.264
looking for a way out.

00:07:53.306 --> 00:07:56.768
She's lost sight of her
true self and she feels trapped.

00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:58.812
Jimi's Duel Showman.

00:07:58.853 --> 00:08:00.981
The steed he once
rode into battle,

00:08:01.022 --> 00:08:04.067
the stalwart giant that
protected this world.

00:08:04.109 --> 00:08:06.319
You believe it's
taken ahold of her?

00:08:06.361 --> 00:08:09.823
I do. If we're to
help her break free,

00:08:09.864 --> 00:08:12.325
we'll need a power
to surpass that giant.

00:08:13.368 --> 00:08:15.370
You've gathered a number
of skilled Players here

00:08:15.412 --> 00:08:17.288
on this ship, haven't you?

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:19.040
And what's more,
your own Equipment

00:08:19.082 --> 00:08:21.042
is rather powerful, as well.

00:08:21.084 --> 00:08:22.669
My cage.

00:08:22.711 --> 00:08:24.921
If the Players' powers
were combined.

00:08:24.963 --> 00:08:28.299
We may be able to overcome
the Duel Showman.

00:08:28.341 --> 00:08:30.218
Your Purple Majesty.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.679
I would like you to
help save my friend.

00:08:32.721 --> 00:08:35.432
[gasps, chuckles]

00:08:35.473 --> 00:08:37.934
Oh, what fun! Glad you asked.

00:08:37.976 --> 00:08:40.311
I'm more than happy to join you.

00:08:40.353 --> 00:08:44.607
See, a long time ago,
I lost somebody precious to me.

00:08:44.649 --> 00:08:47.736
And the worst part
was that when they left me,

00:08:47.777 --> 00:08:48.862
I didn't even get a chance to

00:08:48.903 --> 00:08:51.614
utter the simple
words, "I love you."

00:08:54.034 --> 00:08:57.287
Everybody knows that
we're all gonna die someday.

00:08:57.328 --> 00:08:59.539
Doesn't matter what we do.

00:08:59.581 --> 00:09:02.042
But before I allow
that to happen,

00:09:02.083 --> 00:09:04.044
I'll dance my life away.

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:23.646
[BILIN]
His Purple Majesty. Huh.

00:09:26.066 --> 00:09:27.859
What's happening, Bilin?

00:09:30.904 --> 00:09:31.780
Is this...?

00:09:31.821 --> 00:09:33.698
He's already taking action.

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:36.826
Helping out people affected
by the recent Earless attacks.

00:09:36.868 --> 00:09:39.329
On a smash hit world tour.

00:09:41.081 --> 00:09:44.209
And us? What are we
doing about all this?

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:46.127
The number of Earless
attacks worldwide

00:09:46.169 --> 00:09:49.214
is at unprecedented
levels, and rising.

00:09:49.255 --> 00:09:53.635
Worse yet, this outbreak
began because of that girl.

00:09:53.676 --> 00:09:55.637
And I encouraged
her to press on,

00:09:55.678 --> 00:09:57.847
despite my best judgment.

00:09:57.889 --> 00:10:00.225
I knew it might end this way.

00:10:00.266 --> 00:10:01.726
There's blood on my hands.

00:10:01.768 --> 00:10:03.812
This is my responsibility.

00:10:07.524 --> 00:10:08.691
[KEVIN]
Calm down, Bilin!

00:10:08.733 --> 00:10:10.485
You're running away.

00:10:10.527 --> 00:10:12.487
Just like you did ten years ago,

00:10:12.529 --> 00:10:14.572
trying to wash your
hands of things.

00:10:14.614 --> 00:10:16.074
But I am a knight.

00:10:16.116 --> 00:10:18.201
I will not flee from battle.

00:10:18.243 --> 00:10:19.327
Bilin, stop!

00:10:19.369 --> 00:10:22.705
Players from all around the
world are gathering under Denka.

00:10:22.747 --> 00:10:25.500
In fact, the Princess of Gnome
has joined the effort,

00:10:25.542 --> 00:10:27.168
if rumors are to be believed.

00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:29.712
The Princess. Roz, you mean?

00:10:29.754 --> 00:10:31.506
I'm going to join them,

00:10:31.548 --> 00:10:34.968
and then I am going to
clean up my mess.

00:10:35.009 --> 00:10:37.720
[KEVIN gasps]
Whoa!

00:10:37.762 --> 00:10:40.682
Hold on! Please just
hear me out!

00:10:41.599 --> 00:10:43.226
What you said about me is true.

00:10:43.268 --> 00:10:47.147
I ran away and spent
ten years regretting it.

00:10:47.188 --> 00:10:48.523
Maybe I could have
found some other way

00:10:48.565 --> 00:10:51.484
to stop the Earless
without sacrificing Jimi.

00:10:51.526 --> 00:10:52.861
Do you believe that?

00:10:52.902 --> 00:10:56.322
Yes. If Roz and Denka
were to join forces,

00:10:56.364 --> 00:10:59.617
it could turn out that the girl
lashing out at the world

00:10:59.659 --> 00:11:03.121
unites us and
allows us to prevail!

00:11:03.163 --> 00:11:06.374
What're you saying?
You almost seem happy.

00:11:10.003 --> 00:11:11.629
This time we could do it right.

00:11:11.671 --> 00:11:14.841
We could succeed where
we had failed ten years ago.

00:11:14.883 --> 00:11:16.634
If we work together,

00:11:16.676 --> 00:11:19.721
we can stop that girl
without killing her.

00:11:19.762 --> 00:11:23.099
So you say,
but how do we do it?

00:11:23.141 --> 00:11:24.893
All those scrapped equipment.

00:11:24.934 --> 00:11:28.146
I haven't just been using them
for my own amusement.

00:11:29.731 --> 00:11:32.609
[DENKA] We've scraped together
a veritable army here.

00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:33.735
I have faith in the abilities of

00:11:33.776 --> 00:11:35.695
all the Players
who've joined us,

00:11:35.737 --> 00:11:38.031
but in the face of a monster
like the Duel Showman,

00:11:38.072 --> 00:11:40.658
I'm afraid they don't
amount to much.

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:42.285
In that case, how can we‐‐

00:11:42.327 --> 00:11:44.913
Of course, that is
the real question.

00:11:44.954 --> 00:11:47.081
As I said before,
the Duel Showman

00:11:47.123 --> 00:11:49.667
is the greatest giant
the world has known.

00:11:49.709 --> 00:11:52.170
I could land a clean hit
with my Equipment's main gun

00:11:52.212 --> 00:11:54.547
at the maximum output,
but it would be like

00:11:54.589 --> 00:11:57.300
using a needle to
break up a boulder.

00:11:57.342 --> 00:11:59.761
Ha. If we could somehow
combine the power of

00:11:59.802 --> 00:12:02.388
the Core Parts
assembled here, perhaps.

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:04.140
[KEVIN]
We'd be able to stop her.

00:12:05.475 --> 00:12:06.267
[KEVIN]
You think?

00:12:06.309 --> 00:12:08.144
[DENKA]
Kevin! It's lovely to see

00:12:08.186 --> 00:12:10.271
you've decided to
leave your room.

00:12:10.313 --> 00:12:12.899
[KEVIN] Well I could hardly
pass up the rare opportunity

00:12:12.941 --> 00:12:14.901
to see His Purple Majesty
looking utterly flummoxed

00:12:14.943 --> 00:12:17.820
in the face of a challenge,
now could I?

00:12:17.862 --> 00:12:20.156
There is a way to link
Core Parts together.

00:12:20.198 --> 00:12:22.408
[ALL gasp]

00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:25.286
[KEVIN] An OOPArt purportedly
dating to ancient times.

00:12:25.328 --> 00:12:28.957
It can directly link the Core
Parts of multiple Equipment.

00:12:28.998 --> 00:12:31.626
And it can output their
combined power as well.

00:12:31.668 --> 00:12:33.419
[ROZ]
Does it actually work?

00:12:33.461 --> 00:12:35.421
Wait, Roz? Is that you?

00:12:35.463 --> 00:12:37.966
Your answer, please?
I did ask first.

00:12:38.007 --> 00:12:39.384
[KEVIN]
I've been testing it.

00:12:39.425 --> 00:12:42.053
For ten years,
so many times now.

00:12:42.095 --> 00:12:43.554
And with this...

00:12:43.596 --> 00:12:46.683
We can save her. The real Mu.

00:12:46.724 --> 00:12:48.810
And what if your
plan should fail?

00:12:48.851 --> 00:12:51.854
[KEVIN]
I'll accept full responsibility.

00:12:51.896 --> 00:12:55.316
Yes, I see.
Those two changed you,

00:12:55.358 --> 00:12:57.986
and quite a few of us,
it would seem.

00:12:58.027 --> 00:13:01.072
I can tell you where
she's going to re‐emerge.

00:13:01.114 --> 00:13:04.409
It's a place bearing painful
memories for many here.

00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:05.910
Liverchester.

Look alive, friends!

stands again in
its rightful place!

And with it, the days

have returned to
our humble town!

Now go on living by the pride

Huh? It's raining.

What could she be
so worried about?

00:14:26.949 --> 00:14:28.368
[KEVIN]
Say. Bilin.

00:14:28.409 --> 00:14:29.786
[BILIN]
Yes?

00:14:29.827 --> 00:14:33.081
[KEVIN] Do you think the
world's gonna change today?

00:14:33.122 --> 00:14:36.000
Same question.
What do you think?

00:14:36.042 --> 00:14:38.169
[KEVIN]
We'll change it.

00:14:38.211 --> 00:14:40.171
Whether this plan
will really work,

00:14:40.213 --> 00:14:42.090
I couldn't say.

00:14:42.131 --> 00:14:44.425
All I really know is this.

00:14:44.467 --> 00:14:46.427
The day I met those kids,

00:14:46.469 --> 00:14:48.388
I realized that the future
of the world we live in

00:14:48.429 --> 00:14:49.680
isn't written.

00:14:50.598 --> 00:14:52.517
We could make it better,

00:14:52.558 --> 00:14:55.019
and I'm willing to
bet my life on that.
