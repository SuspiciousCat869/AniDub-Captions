The Merle Forest?

00:00:23.524 --> 00:00:25.484
You got it! That's
the deep wilderness

00:00:25.526 --> 00:00:27.402
that starts near the
edge of Liverchester

00:00:27.444 --> 00:00:29.446

[OLD MAN 2B] Folks can walk
through those woods for days,

only to find out they've
gone nowhere at all.

00:00:36.495 --> 00:00:40.332
Eyes blurry, throats dry,
legs too heavy to lift.

00:00:40.374 --> 00:00:42.543
Then the Merle
Forest reaches out

00:00:42.584 --> 00:00:44.670
and drags them off
into the dark,

00:00:44.711 --> 00:00:46.171
never to be heard from again.

00:00:46.213 --> 00:00:49.758

Those unfortunate souls
get turned into Earless.

They forget all about
their lives as humans

forget how to die.

is roam the forest in agony

it actually true? You think?

If you really wanna
know about the Earless,

00:10:16.241 --> 00:10:18.326
[ECHO] Er, I thought
you said something.

00:10:18.368 --> 00:10:20.787
Anyway, open it up to
page 31 real quick.

00:10:20.829 --> 00:10:22.539
31? Uh.

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:24.040
[ECHO]
Yeah. That's the entry for

00:10:24.082 --> 00:10:25.959
the longest‐serving
Player in history.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.294
Ecrit Pton from the
Solid State Union.

00:10:28.336 --> 00:10:30.839
He probably knows everything
about every Player around,

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:31.923
so maybe he would be able to

00:10:31.965 --> 00:10:34.134
tell us something
about you, too.

00:10:34.175 --> 00:10:37.303
Also, even if he can't,
we've still got options.

00:10:37.345 --> 00:10:40.056
Turn to page 125.

00:10:40.098 --> 00:10:41.474
That's Polly Bee.

00:10:41.516 --> 00:10:43.726
She's known as a big advocate
for female Players,

00:10:43.768 --> 00:10:45.728
and for trying to get
more women into it.

00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:47.856
It would make sense if
she knew who you were.

00:10:47.897 --> 00:10:49.566
And then on page 275 there's

00:10:49.607 --> 00:10:51.985
Doctor Cula Spector,
who's dead now.

00:10:52.026 --> 00:10:53.736
But when he was active,
everybody used to

00:10:53.778 --> 00:10:56.114
call him "the Sage" for
his endless knowledge.

00:10:56.156 --> 00:10:58.658
Someone in his country might
have some information on you.

00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:00.368
‐‐Ooh, and then there's‐‐
‐‐Whoa, wait, hold up.

00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:01.870
Have you memorized
the page numbers

00:11:01.911 --> 00:11:03.538
for all the entries
in the book?

00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:05.206
Yeah, just for fun.

00:11:05.248 --> 00:11:08.042
Every year there's a new edition
with even more entries.

00:11:08.084 --> 00:11:10.128
And I memorize every word.

00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:12.130
Every word, for real?

00:11:12.172 --> 00:11:15.675
Yeah, but that doesn't
mean every Player.

00:11:15.717 --> 00:11:17.051
Back when I was a kid,

00:11:17.093 --> 00:11:19.470
I saw this one Player
who wasn't in the books.

00:11:19.512 --> 00:11:20.555
I told the grown‐ups about it,

00:11:20.597 --> 00:11:22.473
and they all said
I'd imagined him,

00:11:22.515 --> 00:11:24.142
but I couldn't have
dreamed this guy up.

00:11:24.184 --> 00:11:26.144
He was way too cool for that.

00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:29.105
Guess it happens sometimes.

00:11:29.147 --> 00:11:31.399
Players don't get
put into the almanac.

00:11:31.441 --> 00:11:33.234
I'm not sure why, but I assume

00:11:33.276 --> 00:11:35.528
there has to be some
kind of reason for it.

00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:36.905
Prob'ly so.

00:11:36.946 --> 00:11:37.822
Hang on.

00:11:37.864 --> 00:11:40.783
It just hit me, you're a Player,
and you're not in there.

00:11:40.825 --> 00:11:44.454
So‐‐ Nope! Sorry! I didn't look!

00:11:53.796 --> 00:11:55.131
Hey, Mu?

00:12:06.017 --> 00:12:08.770
Who wouldn't be tired
after a day like this?

00:12:08.811 --> 00:12:11.981
Still, you're
something else, Mu.

00:12:12.023 --> 00:12:14.609
Going on a journey to
find your true self.

00:12:14.651 --> 00:12:17.070
Yeah. Sounds all right.

00:12:18.988 --> 00:12:23.660
And hopefully, we run
into him on the way.

00:12:23.701 --> 00:12:25.662
Well then. It's getting late.

00:12:25.703 --> 00:12:27.622
I prob'ly oughta hit the‐‐

00:12:29.874 --> 00:12:33.878
Should probably hit the john
first, 'cept there isn't one.

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:35.421
We're in the
middle of the woods.

00:12:35.463 --> 00:12:37.048
So where do I go then?

00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:39.300
I should get out
of sight, at least.

00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:47.433
[ECHO]
Seriously?

00:12:47.475 --> 00:12:49.894
Not gonna pee there.
That's not a bathroom!

00:12:49.936 --> 00:12:51.271
Is it even a building?

00:12:51.312 --> 00:12:53.523
It looks like a bad dream!

00:12:53.564 --> 00:12:54.941
It'll do.

00:13:22.427 --> 00:13:23.886
[MU]
Echo?

00:13:34.647 --> 00:13:39.277
Why would anybody build
a bathroom like this?

00:13:39.319 --> 00:13:41.487
Guess beggars can't be choosers.

00:13:45.033 --> 00:13:46.576
[ECHO]
It's like I'm a kid again,

00:13:46.617 --> 00:13:49.537
getting scared to go to
the bathroom alone at night.

00:13:50.496 --> 00:13:53.499
Especially after one of
the old timers' scary stories.

00:13:53.541 --> 00:13:56.127
That always made it worse.

00:13:56.169 --> 00:13:57.670
Come to think of it.

00:13:57.712 --> 00:14:00.048
There's one about
a spooky forest.

00:14:00.089 --> 00:14:04.385
Yeah, think it was like,
Merle, possibly?

00:14:05.219 --> 00:14:08.264
Wait, don't tell me.

That girl with you.

Our names? His?

[STUR gasps] Unrivaled is the

Shh! He'll hear you!

We have to play it cool

We've written for him,

Whoa. Gross. Why are

Hold up. Who're you guys?

One could call it coincidence,

the depths of the

Dear Sister!

The Dada successor refuses

00:17:49.652 --> 00:17:52.029
an invitation to the

[STUR] But so be it.
If she and we are at odds,

00:17:54.490 --> 00:17:56.826
then that, too,
we must call inevitable.

00:17:56.867 --> 00:17:59.412
And whatever is inevitable,
the unconscious must abide.

00:17:59.453 --> 00:18:01.080
[EIN]
Then we let it abide.

00:18:01.122 --> 00:18:04.458
Our philosophy bids us accept
the dictates of the unconscious

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:07.086

over to the waves!

Dear Sister.

This child surely bears
the power of Dada, and yet,

in the use of Equipment.

[EIN, STUR, ZENDE]
Ah. Poor, pitiful thing.

00:19:07.229 --> 00:19:09.482
[ZENDE] A Player is one who
makes their conviction heard.

00:19:09.523 --> 00:19:11.317
But from you I feel nothing.

00:19:11.359 --> 00:19:12.610
My heart is unmoved.

00:19:12.652 --> 00:19:15.946
[STUR] You flail without grace,
and unforgivably, without pride.

00:19:15.988 --> 00:19:19.450
[EIN] And with your failure,
the wrath of the Earless grows.

00:19:19.492 --> 00:19:22.244
[MU] What? None of this
makes any sense!

00:19:22.286 --> 00:19:24.997
[ZENDE] Would you care to find
out where the Earless come from?

00:19:25.039 --> 00:19:25.998
[STUR]
Would you like to know

00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:28.084
what they seek as they
roam across the land?

00:19:28.125 --> 00:19:30.461
[EIN] The Earless are
the anguished cries,

00:19:30.503 --> 00:19:32.755
the lingering regrets
of those humans

00:19:32.797 --> 00:19:35.675
who sought to become
Players and failed.

00:19:35.716 --> 00:19:38.094
You mean they're human?

00:19:38.135 --> 00:19:40.137
[ZENDE]
They were, and in each of them

00:19:40.179 --> 00:19:42.223
is a shard of their
old self, in agony over

00:19:42.264 --> 00:19:43.349
what they've become.

00:19:43.391 --> 00:19:45.893
[STUR] Man and beast
locked in eternal struggle

00:19:45.935 --> 00:19:46.977
within one being.

00:19:47.019 --> 00:19:50.022
The salvation they seek
comes at the hands of a Player.

00:19:50.064 --> 00:19:51.565
[EIN]
They are the half‐men.

00:19:51.607 --> 00:19:53.192
Our antithesis as Players,

00:19:53.234 --> 00:19:55.861
identical in substance
yet opposite in form.

00:19:55.903 --> 00:19:58.239
That is the true nature
of the Earless.

00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:00.491
Yeah, and what
the hell do I care?

00:20:00.533 --> 00:20:02.368
I know what I have to do.

00:20:02.410 --> 00:20:04.662
Echo told me I'm a Player.

00:20:04.704 --> 00:20:07.206
And Players have to beat‐‐

00:20:14.505 --> 00:20:16.716
Oh no. What's wrong. Why?

00:20:16.757 --> 00:20:19.427
[ZENDE] Ooh. Could this be
the awakening we dreamed of?

00:20:19.468 --> 00:20:20.845
[STUR]
Well, one would hope.

00:20:20.886 --> 00:20:23.806
After all, this child
is something special!

00:20:23.848 --> 00:20:25.975
[ZENDE] His Greatness,
the Player who also reigned

00:20:26.016 --> 00:20:27.435
as king of the Earless!

00:20:27.476 --> 00:20:29.019
[STUR] The man who
sought to lead the world

00:20:29.061 --> 00:20:30.855
into the tranquility of ruin.

00:20:30.896 --> 00:20:32.565
The one we call our great liege!

00:20:32.606 --> 00:20:34.400
[EIN]
You feel it, too, don't you?

00:20:34.442 --> 00:20:37.153
That element of ruin
flows within your body,

00:20:37.194 --> 00:20:38.404
a piece of him inside you.

00:20:38.446 --> 00:20:42.908
Either start making sense,
or stop talking!

00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:45.745
[EIN] Oh dear. You must
still be half asleep.

00:20:45.786 --> 00:20:49.665
Well then. What do you suppose
you should do about this?

00:20:51.459 --> 00:20:52.251
Echo!

00:20:52.293 --> 00:20:55.546
[STUR] Now! We're sick of
waiting! Unleash your power!

00:20:55.588 --> 00:20:58.048
[ZENDE] Do it now or we'll
turn this boy into an Earless.

00:20:58.090 --> 00:21:00.384
Don't mess with me!

00:21:01.385 --> 00:21:03.220
[ZENDE] It wouldn't be
the least bit difficult

00:21:03.262 --> 00:21:05.222
if you would simply
let it happen.

00:21:05.264 --> 00:21:08.851
[STUR] Do it! Bend your ear
to their cries of anguish.

00:21:08.893 --> 00:21:10.436
[ZENDE]
What are you going to do?

00:21:10.478 --> 00:21:12.480
[STUR]
Where are you going to go?

00:21:12.521 --> 00:21:15.316
[EIN] How are you going to
tear this world asunder?

00:21:15.357 --> 00:21:20.654
Shut up! I decide
who I am. Not you!

00:21:20.696 --> 00:21:23.491
[ZENDE gasps]
Truly, beyond exquisite!

00:21:23.532 --> 00:21:26.285
[STUR] No, not hardly.
The beast's ego freed her,

00:21:26.327 --> 00:21:28.496
but now she can only flail away
with her broken chains.

00:21:28.537 --> 00:21:30.539
Outta my way!

00:21:38.839 --> 00:21:44.345
[EIN chuckles] You see now?
How easy it is to destroy.

00:21:48.974 --> 00:21:53.354
[EARLESS roar]

00:21:53.395 --> 00:21:57.566
[EIN, STUR, ZENDE]
Welcome to the world of Players!

00:22:17.169 --> 00:22:18.712
[gasps]

00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:36.647
Is that‐‐

00:24:11.867 --> 00:24:14.244
[JIMI] As the ones who hang
their heads shuffle through life

00:24:14.286 --> 00:24:16.789
with their gaze
fixed on their shoes,

00:24:16.830 --> 00:24:19.166
the waves of feedback
crashing onto their ears

00:24:19.208 --> 00:24:21.335
will coalesce into a melody.

00:24:21.377 --> 00:24:24.046
And at last, the memory of
our bloodstained romance

00:24:24.088 --> 00:24:26.090
will be washed away.

00:24:26.131 --> 00:24:28.592
The knights set foot
upon a loveless world,

00:24:28.634 --> 00:24:31.845
where some sight takes hold
of their insane eyes.

00:24:31.887 --> 00:24:33.973
Now, speak your name.

00:24:35.182 --> 00:24:37.184
[JIMI]
You Made Me Realise."

00:24:37.226 --> 00:24:39.937
Pray now and be a Player.
