WEBVTT

00:00:10.052 --> 00:00:12.054
[LYDE]
Empty alleyways.

00:00:12.095 --> 00:00:13.889
Peeling asphalt.

00:00:13.931 --> 00:00:17.726
Leaden skies that
stretch on forever.

00:00:17.768 --> 00:00:20.604
I live here,
in the middle of it.

00:00:20.646 --> 00:00:24.149
There was a time when the world
revolved around this place.

00:00:24.191 --> 00:00:25.317
Or at least,
that's what I'm told

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:27.903
by all the geezers around here.

00:00:27.945 --> 00:00:30.405
But if that's how things were,

00:00:30.447 --> 00:00:32.699
you'd never know
by looking at it.

00:00:34.201 --> 00:00:36.787
[LYDE]
There is no future.

00:00:36.828 --> 00:00:39.206
We're just flowers
in the dustbin.

00:00:39.248 --> 00:00:40.415
[ALARM blaring]

00:00:40.457 --> 00:00:41.542
[RITCHIE]
Oh crap, oh crap, oh crap!

00:00:41.583 --> 00:00:43.669
Ritchie, hey. What's the‐‐?

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.212
Lyde, run!

00:00:52.344 --> 00:00:54.471
[RITCHIE]
Damn it. Get away from me!

00:00:54.513 --> 00:00:56.306
You want some of this?

00:00:56.348 --> 00:00:58.642
[LYDE]
Oh wow. Am I gonna die?

00:00:58.684 --> 00:01:00.394
Here in this hellhole?

00:01:00.435 --> 00:01:04.022
But I can't die.
I'm not ready yet!

00:01:04.064 --> 00:01:07.150
Damn it all, there's still
too much I wanna do!

00:01:18.245 --> 00:01:20.163
[gasps] Did we just get saved?

00:01:20.205 --> 00:01:21.748
[RITCHIE]
No way.

00:01:26.587 --> 00:01:28.088
[gasps]

00:01:31.758 --> 00:01:33.802
Are you seriously
drawing right now?

00:01:33.844 --> 00:01:35.012
Yeah.

00:01:35.971 --> 00:01:39.850
[LYDE] A moment like this...
I can't let myself forget.

00:03:21.868 --> 00:03:25.872
[RITCHIE sighs]
Freezin' my bollocks off!

00:03:25.914 --> 00:03:28.542
Keep slackin' off like that and
the boss is gonna yell at you.

00:03:28.583 --> 00:03:30.669
[LYDE]
Yeah, like I don't know.

00:03:31.753 --> 00:03:35.215
Huh? Were you just sitting here
daydreaming about that one time?

00:03:35.257 --> 00:03:36.049
[LYDE]
Yep.

00:03:36.091 --> 00:03:37.801
Man, you're ten years older,

00:03:37.843 --> 00:03:40.679
but somehow you still haven't
gotten over that whole thing.

00:03:40.721 --> 00:03:42.514
Right, and you still
haven't gotten laid.

00:03:42.556 --> 00:03:44.433
Screw you, mate.

00:03:45.934 --> 00:03:46.977
[RITCHIE]
Boss!

00:03:47.018 --> 00:03:49.104
What the hell'd
you do this time?

00:03:49.187 --> 00:03:50.480
Did you think I wouldn't notice

00:03:50.522 --> 00:03:51.648
you stealing out
of the register?

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:52.983
Cram it, old man!

00:03:53.024 --> 00:03:54.276
Hey! That's enough!

00:03:54.317 --> 00:03:56.278
This town's full of
vermin like you,

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:58.697
and any one of 'em
could do your crap job.

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:01.158
So you can either give back
what you took, right now.

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:03.660
Or you can get outta my shop.

00:04:03.702 --> 00:04:04.911
Your call, kid!

00:04:04.953 --> 00:04:06.663
I'm keepin' the cash,
and my job!

00:04:06.705 --> 00:04:08.039
Great, way to confess.

00:04:08.081 --> 00:04:10.041
[MALCOLM]
You filthy little urchin!

00:04:10.083 --> 00:04:13.962
[NIR] So this seems like an
important conversation, but...

00:04:14.004 --> 00:04:15.839
If you think it's
gonna take a while,

00:04:15.881 --> 00:04:17.966
could you fix this for me first?

00:04:18.008 --> 00:04:19.509
[RITCHIE]
Oh, wow, sick!

00:04:19.551 --> 00:04:22.220
I haven't seen
a vintage amp in ages!

00:04:23.638 --> 00:04:25.056
[MALCOLM gasps]

00:04:25.098 --> 00:04:28.643
Oh, Lyde, it seems you're up!
See to our client.

00:04:34.357 --> 00:04:36.276
[NIR] Is this place
as sketchy as it seems?

00:04:36.318 --> 00:04:38.361
Oh yeah, and then some.

00:04:38.403 --> 00:04:41.656
Lyde may have sticky fingers,
but he's also got smart hands.

00:04:41.698 --> 00:04:43.408
He's been a genius
at fixin' up gadgets

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:45.035
ever since we were little.

00:04:45.076 --> 00:04:47.412
And you wouldn't guess it,
but he draws good as well.

00:04:47.454 --> 00:04:49.790
Really. You two known
each other for a while?

00:04:49.831 --> 00:04:52.375
[RITCHIE] Yup. Thick as thieves
since the age o' five.

00:04:52.417 --> 00:04:54.503
[LYDE]
What're you jawin' about?

00:04:54.544 --> 00:04:56.379
Whoa! Done already?

00:04:56.421 --> 00:04:59.049
Just had to fix the
power supply connections

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:01.426
and replace the bits
that'd fallen off.

00:05:01.468 --> 00:05:03.762
It's in way better shape now.

00:05:03.804 --> 00:05:06.807
You're all set, but don't
take my word for it.

00:05:06.848 --> 00:05:08.767
Hold down the fort,
would ya, Ritchie?

00:05:08.809 --> 00:05:10.602
Right.

00:05:10.644 --> 00:05:13.063
[NIR] Sorry. Where are
we going, again?

00:05:13.104 --> 00:05:16.107
[LYDE chuckles] You'll find
out once we're there.

00:05:18.276 --> 00:05:20.987
[LOUDSPEAKER VOICE 7A] This is
the Londinium Patrol Squad.

This is crazy responsive! Wow.

00:05:35.585 --> 00:05:36.378
[LYDE]
How is it?

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:38.505
It's better than perfect,
for real!

00:05:38.547 --> 00:05:41.049
I can't remember the last time
it moved this well!

00:05:41.091 --> 00:05:42.217
Great!

00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:44.427
[NIR] Hey, you should
see for yourself.

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:46.304
Wait. I should?

00:05:46.346 --> 00:05:49.057
Yeah! You're the one
who fixed it for me.

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:51.101
It's only fair that
you get to ride it.

00:05:51.142 --> 00:05:54.020
[LYDE] Nobody's ever said
anything like that to me before.

00:05:58.775 --> 00:06:00.235
Sorry about the tight fit.

00:06:00.277 --> 00:06:02.571
It's not really made
to be a two‐seater.

[LYDE screams]

00:06:14.291 --> 00:06:15.667
[NIR]
So? How's it feel?

00:06:15.709 --> 00:06:18.712

It feels awesome!

Turn back now.

who I think it is?

Oh, you ass.

What happened to
watching the shop?

Where is he going?

What's he gonna do?

It's a ritual of his.

the punchline.

Uh‐‐ Yeah. 'Kay.

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:25.946
[LYDE] I think maybe
he enjoys the rejection.

He gets shot down over and over.

00:07:28.615 --> 00:07:30.158
But he keeps going back.

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:33.119
Welp, he's gonna need
a shoulder to cry on.

You piece of shit!

Am I paying you to abandon
my shop and go bugger around?

We weren't screwing
around, you wanker!

00:07:47.425 --> 00:07:49.803
[RITCHIE]
Nice. Way to confess, again.

00:07:49.844 --> 00:07:51.846
[LYDE] I finished fixing
that customer's amp.

00:07:51.888 --> 00:07:53.890
We had to test it to make sure
I didn't break the thing!

[MALCOLM]
I don't wanna hear it!

00:07:57.268 --> 00:08:00.355
And you still made time for
more of your worthless doodles.

00:08:00.397 --> 00:08:01.648
Fancy yourself an artist, boy?

00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:02.899
Give that back!

00:08:02.941 --> 00:08:04.609
You think your crappy
little scribbles

00:08:04.651 --> 00:08:06.528
are gonna help you
get outta this town?

Waving something precious
around like a piece of trash.

Aren't you supposed
to be the adult?

00:08:19.833 --> 00:08:22.210

That's the best laugh
I've had in ages!

The look on that
old geezer's face

00:08:49.612 --> 00:08:51.448
when you threw that
wad of bills at him!

00:08:51.489 --> 00:08:53.950
[LYDE, RITCHIE laughing]

00:08:53.992 --> 00:08:55.577
[RITCHIE]
Why you look so glum, Big Bro?

00:08:55.618 --> 00:08:57.912
You oughta be
laughing right now.

00:08:57.954 --> 00:09:00.498
That did feel pretty good
in the moment,

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:03.001
but I'm a little worried
where this all ends up.

00:09:03.043 --> 00:09:05.336
Nah, I don't think there's
anything to worry about.

00:09:05.378 --> 00:09:08.006
Me neither, it's fine.
If that asshole likes

00:09:08.048 --> 00:09:10.633
scrabbling on the floor
for change, good for him.

00:09:10.675 --> 00:09:11.551
Right, Big Bro?

00:09:11.593 --> 00:09:14.804
[sighs] You guys,
I'm not your big bro.

00:09:14.846 --> 00:09:17.098
Can I get a better
nickname, please?

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:19.726
Like, for starters, I'm
obviously the youngest one here.

00:09:19.768 --> 00:09:21.311
[RITCHIE] You're not wrong,
but I don't think

00:09:21.352 --> 00:09:23.271
you ever gave us
your real name, did ya?

00:09:23.313 --> 00:09:24.147
Huh.

00:09:24.189 --> 00:09:26.399
Time for a proper introduction.

00:09:26.441 --> 00:09:28.651
My name is Lyde.

00:09:29.819 --> 00:09:31.905
Good to meet ya. I'm Nir.

00:09:31.946 --> 00:09:34.908
So tell us, Nir, what brings
you here to Londinium?

There's nothing in particular.

I caused a lot of trouble
back where I came from.

00:09:40.705 --> 00:09:43.666
I couldn't stay there
so I ended up here.

Whoa, you dodgin' the heat?

00:09:44.793 --> 00:09:46.628
Come on, we want the details.

00:09:46.669 --> 00:09:49.130
No you don't.
It's not interesting.

00:09:49.172 --> 00:09:52.300
C'mon, mate,
stop spoiling the mood.

00:09:52.342 --> 00:09:54.636
Hey, you should let us
put you up for the night!

00:09:54.677 --> 00:09:57.055

you to take a look at.

thing you say...

Long time, madam.

00:10:11.861 --> 00:10:13.822
Hello, miss.

00:10:13.863 --> 00:10:15.615
[VIVIENNE] Did you all
have something to eat

00:10:15.657 --> 00:10:17.117
before you came?

00:10:17.158 --> 00:10:20.036
Because I've got a bit of
soup left if you want it.

00:10:20.078 --> 00:10:21.371
[LYDE]
Yeah, we know, thanks!

00:10:21.412 --> 00:10:22.914
Who is she?

00:10:22.956 --> 00:10:24.624
[LYDE]
Oh, she's our mom.

00:10:24.666 --> 00:10:26.835
Like, not our actual one,
but y'know.

00:10:26.876 --> 00:10:27.710
[NIR gasps]

00:10:27.752 --> 00:10:30.463
[RITCHIE] Our real families all
got snuffed out a long time ago,

00:10:30.505 --> 00:10:32.841
back when the Earless
blitzed Londinium.

00:10:34.008 --> 00:10:36.219
Right. Sorry to bring it up.

00:10:36.261 --> 00:10:39.180
And Vivienne was
the kindly old bat

00:10:39.222 --> 00:10:42.183
who gave us both
a place to stay!

00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:46.980
[LYDE RITCHIE]
One, two!

00:10:48.565 --> 00:10:51.151
Is that one of those
things we saw earlier?

00:10:51.192 --> 00:10:54.654
Yeah, the same Equipment
the Londinium Patrol Squad uses.

00:10:54.696 --> 00:10:58.158
Those wankers abandoned it
for scrap, and then we found it!

00:10:58.199 --> 00:11:00.827
Decent stroke of luck,
right Big Bro?

00:11:00.869 --> 00:11:04.414
[LYDE]
And now.... we've got a pilot.

00:11:04.455 --> 00:11:06.291
Uh, wait, me?

00:11:08.084 --> 00:11:09.586
[LYDE]
First things first.

00:11:09.627 --> 00:11:12.672
We gotta get that
guy fully fixed up.

00:11:12.714 --> 00:11:15.008
So then, whaddya think
of my special soup?

00:11:15.049 --> 00:11:17.135
Man. It's good stuff!

00:11:17.177 --> 00:11:19.888
Even the food I'd get in Chelsea
doesn't compare to this!

00:11:19.929 --> 00:11:23.892
Oh, my. Flattery will get you
everywhere, Ritchie dear!

00:11:23.933 --> 00:11:24.726
Right, then.

00:11:24.767 --> 00:11:26.519
Time to turn in for the night.

00:11:26.561 --> 00:11:27.854
Do remember to clean up.

00:11:27.896 --> 00:11:28.897
So bland.

00:11:28.938 --> 00:11:30.815
You guzzled it
like you'd die without it.

00:11:30.857 --> 00:11:34.027
So? I genuinely
enjoy this stuff.

00:11:35.862 --> 00:11:37.572
Never mind the bad soup.

00:11:37.614 --> 00:11:39.908
Back to the subject
of that Equipment.

00:11:39.949 --> 00:11:41.826
It's not far from being ready,

00:11:41.868 --> 00:11:44.370
but even once it's fixed,
neither of us is a Player,

00:11:44.412 --> 00:11:47.332
so it's not like we
could do anything with it.

00:11:47.373 --> 00:11:52.003
Please, help us! We can't
pilot it, but you can!

00:12:00.762 --> 00:12:04.057
And plus, you need somewhere
to stay in town, right?

00:12:04.098 --> 00:12:06.392
I know it ain't
the nicest place,

00:12:06.434 --> 00:12:09.103
but still, it's something!

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:14.984
You guys. Are you sure
it's okay if I stay?

00:12:15.026 --> 00:12:18.655
What are you saying, Big Bro?
Of course we are. Right?

00:12:18.696 --> 00:12:20.240
Obviously!

00:12:22.325 --> 00:12:24.035
Thank you both.

00:12:24.077 --> 00:12:25.036
That settles it then.

00:12:25.078 --> 00:12:26.871
Hell yeah!

00:12:26.913 --> 00:12:29.624
[LYDE, RITCHIE laughing]

00:12:30.708 --> 00:12:32.252
Be honest.

00:12:32.293 --> 00:12:36.005
Do you think we'll be able to
make the Equipment work?

00:12:37.257 --> 00:12:42.053
Yeah. I know it.
'Cause you two have conviction.

00:12:42.095 --> 00:12:44.264
Keep going. You got it?

00:12:44.305 --> 00:12:46.057
That's what I think.

00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:49.978
[NIR] Well, Echo.
It looks like I might have

00:12:50.019 --> 00:12:53.189
gotten myself into
kind of a weird situation.

00:13:00.613 --> 00:13:03.449
Oh? I'm sorry,
did I wake you?

00:13:03.491 --> 00:13:05.535
You're fine.

00:13:05.576 --> 00:13:07.704
[VIVIENNE] How dare that boy
leave such a sweet child

00:13:07.745 --> 00:13:09.622
to sleep out here on the couch!

00:13:09.664 --> 00:13:12.333
I'll be having a strong word
or three with him later.

00:13:12.375 --> 00:13:14.544
Um, where are Lyde and Ritchie?

00:13:14.585 --> 00:13:17.463
Balcony. Seems they wanted
to get an early start.

00:13:17.505 --> 00:13:20.174
They must have a lot
of rummaging to do.

00:13:23.469 --> 00:13:24.846
[LYDE]
Finally woke up, did ya?

00:13:24.887 --> 00:13:27.432
[RITCHIE]
Hey! Good day to you, Big Bro!

00:13:28.975 --> 00:13:32.270
Hey, so, what with us
gettin' fired and all that,

00:13:32.312 --> 00:13:33.521
we're left with plenty of time

00:13:33.563 --> 00:13:35.106
to get this thing
up and running.

00:13:35.148 --> 00:13:38.067
Yeah. That's right.
We work for us now!

00:13:38.109 --> 00:13:39.819
Here's to our newfound freedom.

00:13:39.861 --> 00:13:41.654
[LYDE, RITCHIE]
Oi!

00:14:18.149 --> 00:14:19.567
[NIR]
It's snowing.

00:14:21.611 --> 00:14:23.946
[RITCHIE] My heart's kinda
beating out of my chest.

00:14:23.988 --> 00:14:25.948
So how's it look?
Think it'll run?

00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:28.201
[NIR sighs]
That's hard to say.

00:14:28.242 --> 00:14:30.328
We'll only really know
once we try it.

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:32.914
Step back, guys. Safety first.

00:14:35.541 --> 00:14:37.835
‐‐[RITCHIE] Whoa!
‐‐[LYDE] It's moving!

00:14:44.175 --> 00:14:45.885
What's going on?

00:14:53.351 --> 00:14:54.310
[LYDE]
You okay?

00:14:54.352 --> 00:14:57.730
Yeah. I'm all right.
It's just...

00:15:03.694 --> 00:15:05.405
Tell me something.

00:15:05.446 --> 00:15:07.532
If you can get
this thing to work,

00:15:07.573 --> 00:15:09.367
what are you gonna do with it?

00:15:09.409 --> 00:15:12.620
[gasps] I guess...

00:15:17.583 --> 00:15:20.294
[LYDE] I wanna shove it
down their throats.

00:15:20.336 --> 00:15:22.046
Those housebroken
dogs in the tower

00:15:22.088 --> 00:15:23.798
in the heart of Londinium.

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:25.758
Blind fascists tryin'a
waste our lives

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:28.302
for their "important" cause.

00:15:28.344 --> 00:15:30.430
I'm gonna make
those bastards see.

00:15:30.471 --> 00:15:33.349
I'm gonna show 'em
that anger can be power!

00:15:34.809 --> 00:15:37.311
[VIVIENNE]
Hey there, youngsters.

00:15:37.353 --> 00:15:39.105
Pick up the cake, would you?

00:15:39.147 --> 00:15:41.232
It's hardly a proper
Christmas without it.

00:15:41.274 --> 00:15:42.483
A Christmas cake?

00:15:42.525 --> 00:15:45.153
I'm an anarchist
and an antichrist.

00:15:45.194 --> 00:15:46.988
Who cares about some
stranger's birthday?

00:15:47.029 --> 00:15:50.450
Yes, ever the freethinker.
Right, then.

00:15:50.491 --> 00:15:51.617
[NIR]
I'll go get it.

00:15:51.659 --> 00:15:52.618
Really?

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:55.246
I just happen to have
a bit of time to kill.

00:15:59.584 --> 00:16:02.545
[NIR] I have no idea
what I'm even doing here.

00:16:02.587 --> 00:16:03.546
How am I supposed to know

00:16:03.588 --> 00:16:06.591
what a boy would want
for a Christmas present?

00:16:11.888 --> 00:16:14.682
Hi there. Doing a bit of
Christmas shopping, eh?

00:16:14.724 --> 00:16:16.601
No. I mean, I...

00:16:16.642 --> 00:16:20.104
Right. One small thing, dear.

00:16:20.146 --> 00:16:23.524
That machine, it belongs
to you, correct?

00:16:23.566 --> 00:16:24.942
The Council Unit will surely

00:16:24.984 --> 00:16:27.195
raise a stink if they
catch wind of it.

00:16:27.236 --> 00:16:29.780
Best hide it in the
back alley next time.

00:16:29.822 --> 00:16:31.824
Thank you for the tip, sir.

00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:34.702
[NIR]
That coulda been bad.

00:16:34.744 --> 00:16:37.288
I would have come on foot,
but I was in a hurry.

00:16:39.207 --> 00:16:41.834
Okay, so, what's the
fastest way to

00:16:41.876 --> 00:16:44.504
that cake shop
she told me about?

00:16:46.547 --> 00:16:47.965
[NIR]
What's this?

00:17:10.446 --> 00:17:11.906
[LOUDSPEAKER VOICE 7A]
Earless have been spotted

00:17:11.948 --> 00:17:13.699
approaching Londinium.

00:17:13.741 --> 00:17:16.410
All residents are
asked to remain calm

00:17:16.452 --> 00:17:17.787
and take refuge...

00:17:17.828 --> 00:17:20.665
On Christmas? Are you serious?

00:17:20.706 --> 00:17:21.916
What's going on there?

00:17:21.958 --> 00:17:23.376
I see a flashing light!

00:17:23.417 --> 00:17:24.252
Where's that?

00:17:24.293 --> 00:17:27.088
There, up on the tower!

00:17:27.129 --> 00:17:28.214
[gasps]

00:17:28.256 --> 00:17:32.093
[LOUDSPEAKER VOICE 7A] Repeat.
Seek shelter immediately.

00:17:32.134 --> 00:17:36.097
The decision has been made to
implement Operation Godfather.

00:17:36.138 --> 00:17:39.267
In order to draw the Earless
Queen to this location,

00:17:39.308 --> 00:17:42.395
the scrapping of the West End
district will now commence.

00:17:42.436 --> 00:17:44.188
[NIR]
Scrapping?

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:46.148
[LOUDSPEAKER VOICE 7A]
Repeat. In accordance with

00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:48.067
Operation Godfather,

00:17:48.109 --> 00:17:52.113
the scrapping of the West End
district will now commence.

00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:58.452
This is insane!

00:17:58.494 --> 00:18:01.372
Are they really
destroying their own city?

Damn it! Damn it! Damn it all!

What are those pigs
shooting at us for?

00:18:17.471 --> 00:18:19.557
What the hell is
going on in this town?

00:18:19.599 --> 00:18:20.641

be trying to kill

00:18:20.683 --> 00:18:22.727

I'm doin' it.

00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:35.615
Wait, doin' what?

00:18:35.656 --> 00:18:38.200
All those cockroaches
infesting the tower.

Those damn filthy earless.

I'm gonna burn it down!

Oh, hey! What's up?
Check it out!

00:19:27.958 --> 00:19:30.920
Somehow, this jack suddenly
sprouted on my back!

I've wanted this for so long.

00:20:03.452 --> 00:20:04.745
To do what he did.

00:20:04.787 --> 00:20:07.164
The guy who saved us that day.

00:20:07.206 --> 00:20:10.126
And in my head I realized
it was madness.

00:20:10.167 --> 00:20:12.378
But I could never
let go of the dream.

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:14.046
[RITCHIE]
Then let's do it.

00:20:14.088 --> 00:20:16.298
We'll show those bastards
we're not garbage,

00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:17.717
and they can't throw us out!

00:20:17.758 --> 00:20:19.677
That's right!

00:20:19.719 --> 00:20:23.055
[RITCHIE, LYDE yell]

00:20:23.097 --> 00:20:24.765
[LYDE]
If you wanna win the battle,

00:20:24.807 --> 00:20:27.017
you gotta take out
the enemy leader!

00:20:27.059 --> 00:20:27.852
[RITCHIE]
Go!

00:20:27.893 --> 00:20:29.729
[LYDE]
We're still alive and breathing,

00:20:29.770 --> 00:20:32.398
and we're gonna prove it to 'em!

00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:33.524
[LYDE, RITCHIE]
God.

00:20:33.566 --> 00:20:35.109
Save.

00:20:35.151 --> 00:20:38.362
The Queen!

00:20:45.202 --> 00:20:46.620
[NIR]
Lyde!

00:20:52.543 --> 00:20:55.254
Did we just beat the boss?

00:20:55.296 --> 00:20:56.714
No way.

00:21:01.677 --> 00:21:02.928
Is that...?

00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:10.519
[LYDE gasps]
No way!

00:21:14.106 --> 00:21:15.900
The test is going well.

00:21:15.941 --> 00:21:18.694
Everything is falling
within our parameters.

00:21:18.736 --> 00:21:20.738
No problems to report.

00:21:22.948 --> 00:21:24.158
[gasps]

00:21:34.794 --> 00:21:36.837
[NIR]
How could you do this?

00:21:36.879 --> 00:21:38.631
I don't understand!

00:21:38.672 --> 00:21:42.593
How did you even get here? Mu!

00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:53.270
[NIR] Ever since,
I've been thinking.

00:21:53.312 --> 00:21:55.564
Everything's my fault.

00:21:55.606 --> 00:21:57.733
If I hadn't encouraged them,

00:21:57.775 --> 00:21:59.068
those two wouldn't
have been able to

00:21:59.109 --> 00:22:01.737
take out the Equipment
into battle that day.

00:22:02.863 --> 00:22:05.825
I didn't want you to
die for our country.

00:22:05.866 --> 00:22:07.326
You were worth more.

00:22:07.368 --> 00:22:11.413
I would have been happy just to
see my boys come home again.

00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:15.251
[VIVIENNE] I'd hand you both
a bowl of hot soup,

00:22:15.292 --> 00:22:19.129
and you'd eat it all and
tell me how delicious it was.

00:22:19.171 --> 00:22:21.257
[NIR] I've been thinking,
that you two would have

00:22:21.298 --> 00:22:23.759
been better off
if we'd never met.

00:22:24.844 --> 00:22:27.388
[NIR] Mu, there's no way
I can forgive you

00:22:27.429 --> 00:22:29.557
for what you did to them.

00:22:32.101 --> 00:22:33.894
[NIR]
And Echo.

00:22:33.936 --> 00:22:35.896
How could this happen?

00:22:35.938 --> 00:22:37.815
Where are you?

00:24:11.784 --> 00:24:13.410
[JIMI] The watchtower
gives a clear view of

00:24:13.452 --> 00:24:16.121
the peasants' rowdy
banquet down below.

00:24:16.163 --> 00:24:20.084
The children twirl and dance to
the beat of sha‐la‐la‐la‐lee.

00:24:20.125 --> 00:24:22.670
And at last the boy
learns that in the end,

00:24:22.711 --> 00:24:24.838
you can't always
get what you want.

00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:27.758
Snow comes down heavy
on the holy day.

00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:29.760
The curtain rises on the stage

00:24:29.802 --> 00:24:31.887
and you make your way
over the rainbow.

00:24:31.929 --> 00:24:34.056
As the words escape your lips.

00:24:34.098 --> 00:24:36.016
"Who am I?"

00:24:36.058 --> 00:24:40.270
"Real Me." The Player's
world is about to change.
