WEBVTT

00:00:09.301 --> 00:00:12.721
[ROBERT] The only person you're
ever really gonna know is you.

00:00:12.763 --> 00:00:14.431
Your friends, your family.

00:00:14.473 --> 00:00:17.017
No matter how close
to them you may feel,

00:00:17.059 --> 00:00:18.352
there's still parts of 'em that

00:00:18.393 --> 00:00:20.771
they couldn't show you
if they wanted.

00:00:20.854 --> 00:00:23.774
You can only understand
as much of 'em as you can see.

00:00:23.815 --> 00:00:25.734
The rest is a mystery.

00:00:26.777 --> 00:00:29.863
True enough. Life goes on.

00:00:29.905 --> 00:00:31.490
Beyond our sight.

00:00:31.532 --> 00:00:33.367
All we see is
where things end up.

00:00:33.408 --> 00:00:37.996
World keeps turning when
we're standing still. Yeah?

00:00:38.038 --> 00:00:39.706
[JIMI]
And that's exactly why

00:00:39.748 --> 00:00:42.960
we all have to come
together as one.

00:00:43.001 --> 00:00:45.796
Well. Mister Devil.

00:00:45.837 --> 00:00:47.881
I believe it's time to go.

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:41.286
[ECHO snoring]

00:02:42.371 --> 00:02:45.540
[JANIS humming]

00:02:45.582 --> 00:02:46.958
Mu...

00:02:49.127 --> 00:02:50.170
Huh?

00:03:03.517 --> 00:03:04.726
[gasps]

00:03:04.768 --> 00:03:07.187
[cow moos]

00:03:08.438 --> 00:03:09.481
Ew...

00:03:09.523 --> 00:03:10.899
[JANIS]
Feeling okay?

00:03:10.941 --> 00:03:14.152
No way, this sucks! Ugh.

00:03:15.278 --> 00:03:17.155
Uh. Sorry about that.

00:03:17.197 --> 00:03:19.491
It's just that you
were really dirty.

00:03:19.533 --> 00:03:20.951
The plan was to
get you cleaned up

00:03:20.992 --> 00:03:24.037
before we brought you
into the house. With this!

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:26.707
Oh, wow. That's very
thoughtful of you.

00:03:26.748 --> 00:03:28.208
Except that I'm not a horse!

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:29.876
That thing would shred my skin!

00:03:29.918 --> 00:03:33.046
Hold on. I'm lost.

00:03:33.088 --> 00:03:35.006
First of all. Where's this?

00:03:35.048 --> 00:03:36.591
[JANIS] Just a little farm
on the outskirts of

00:03:36.633 --> 00:03:39.177
a Blues town called Clarksdale.

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:42.013
You're out in the cow barn,
to be specific.

00:03:42.055 --> 00:03:43.390
Sitting on a hay bale.

00:03:43.432 --> 00:03:45.392
Okay, how did I get here?

00:03:45.434 --> 00:03:47.185
I found you sleeping
on a garbage heap

00:03:47.227 --> 00:03:48.395
and brought you home.

00:03:48.437 --> 00:03:50.522
That's the story. Make sense?

00:03:50.564 --> 00:03:54.526
[gasps] You did? I see.

00:03:54.568 --> 00:03:58.071
Yeah, makes sense. Why not.

00:03:58.113 --> 00:04:02.075
My name's Janis.
It's nice to meet you.

00:04:02.117 --> 00:04:03.910
And your name is?

00:04:05.328 --> 00:04:07.789
[JANIS]
Ah. Sounds like ya been on

00:04:07.831 --> 00:04:09.624
one heck of an adventure, Echo!

00:04:09.666 --> 00:04:12.377
Sure, but it doesn't
feel like it.

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:14.546
I was mostly just tagging along.

00:04:14.588 --> 00:04:16.256
[JANIS]
But that's still somethin'.

00:04:16.298 --> 00:04:19.092
Getting to see the world
like that is pretty amazing!

00:04:19.134 --> 00:04:22.012
I've only seen this
little piece of it myself,

00:04:22.053 --> 00:04:24.681
but I think your story
is really incredible.

00:04:24.723 --> 00:04:29.686
[chuckles] But I wasn't
the main character. Honestly.

00:04:30.604 --> 00:04:33.982
[JANIS] Hm? I took up
the hem a bit. Try 'em on.

00:04:34.024 --> 00:04:36.651
Huh? Wait, for real?

00:04:36.693 --> 00:04:38.737
You didn't need to
do that for me.

00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:41.990
But why wouldn't I?
No one else is wearing 'em.

00:04:42.032 --> 00:04:44.493
Well, sure. But still.

00:04:44.534 --> 00:04:45.869
[JANIS]
And this girl.

00:04:45.911 --> 00:04:47.996
She more or less
ditched you, didn't she?

00:04:48.038 --> 00:04:49.164
Uh‐‐

00:04:49.206 --> 00:04:50.499
[JANIS]
Do you have somewhere to go?

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:51.875
No, nowhere.

00:04:51.917 --> 00:04:54.878
So, then you might as well
stick around for a while.

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:56.296
Your journey's over and you're

00:04:56.338 --> 00:04:57.964
in no hurry to get
anywhere, right?

00:04:58.006 --> 00:04:59.049
[ECHO sighs]

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:00.425
That's that.

00:05:00.467 --> 00:05:03.386
Now, it's about time for me
to go get dinner started.

00:05:03.428 --> 00:05:04.429
Make yourself at home!

00:05:04.471 --> 00:05:06.765
Uh, wait. Hold on!

00:05:22.656 --> 00:05:24.866
[gasps]

00:05:24.908 --> 00:05:26.159
Either way.

00:05:26.201 --> 00:05:29.454
I don't think I'm ever
gonna get bored out here.

00:05:29.496 --> 00:05:33.124
That kind of attitude.
I love it!

00:05:33.166 --> 00:05:34.543
No matter.

00:05:34.584 --> 00:05:37.796
Little boy. You're no Player.

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:42.300
[ECHO]
That's right. My journey.

00:05:43.635 --> 00:05:46.263
Yeah. It's over.

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:55.874
[ECHO]
Where do you go, buddy?

00:06:58.251 --> 00:07:00.128
Where do you want me
to leave this stuff?

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:02.672
[JANIS] Uh. Wherever
there's room is fine!

00:07:02.714 --> 00:07:05.175
Well that doesn't
narrow it down at all.

00:07:10.263 --> 00:07:12.307
Huh? Books?

00:07:15.685 --> 00:07:19.856
[coughs] I guess not. Art?

00:07:21.107 --> 00:07:25.695
Whoa, easy! This isn't
a plate, is it?

00:07:25.737 --> 00:07:26.529
[JANIS]
Echo?

00:07:26.571 --> 00:07:28.990
Oh, I uh... Sorry.

00:07:29.032 --> 00:07:30.367
I should have asked. Um.

00:07:30.408 --> 00:07:32.744
Oh, you're fine. Don't worry.

00:07:32.786 --> 00:07:36.373
Cool. So, uh, what are these?

00:07:36.414 --> 00:07:37.374
Chronicles.

00:07:37.415 --> 00:07:38.375
Really?

00:07:38.416 --> 00:07:40.752
Wait, that might not
be quite right.

00:07:40.794 --> 00:07:43.213
They're more like memories.

00:07:43.254 --> 00:07:44.464
Whose are they?

00:07:44.506 --> 00:07:48.843
Can't say. But they've been
gathering dust here forever.

00:07:48.885 --> 00:07:52.722
And I can't imagine anybody'll
come looking for most of 'em.

00:07:52.764 --> 00:07:56.351
Sometimes I feel like we oughta
just toss the whole bunch.

00:07:56.393 --> 00:07:58.603
It'd sure freshen
the place up, I bet.

00:07:58.645 --> 00:08:02.774
Except. Maybe we shouldn't
forget about 'em.

00:08:02.816 --> 00:08:04.943
Maybe we don't want to?

00:08:04.985 --> 00:08:07.237
Somethin' like that.

00:08:07.278 --> 00:08:10.073
Anyway. How's dinner sound?

00:08:14.494 --> 00:08:18.540
[ECHO] Getting by out here.
It's pretty simple.

00:08:18.581 --> 00:08:24.254
We eat, sleep, do our work.
But that's just survival.

00:08:24.295 --> 00:08:27.674
Every now and then
we do other things.

00:08:27.716 --> 00:08:30.468
Things we don't have
to do to stay alive.

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:32.762
And those matter, too, right?

00:08:32.804 --> 00:08:34.014
Echo?

00:08:36.474 --> 00:08:38.059

[cow moos]

00:08:58.371 --> 00:09:02.083
It's gonna be a while.
I'll make some tea.

00:09:02.125 --> 00:09:03.543
[ECHO]
Will she be okay?

00:09:03.585 --> 00:09:05.045
[ROBERT]
That's out of our hands.

00:09:05.086 --> 00:09:06.838
We just gotta wait and see.

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:08.298
[ECHO]
Oh...

[moos]

00:09:10.091 --> 00:09:14.429
It happens tonight.
Either a birth or a death.

00:09:14.471 --> 00:09:16.222
She might die?

00:09:16.264 --> 00:09:19.559
[ROBERT]
Yep, same as anything else.

00:09:19.601 --> 00:09:23.104
And either way, we keep playing
with whatever cards we're dealt.

00:09:25.732 --> 00:09:27.776
[ROBERT] That line between
living and dying,

00:09:27.817 --> 00:09:30.278
it's too thin for us to see.

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:32.030
We each walk our path.

00:09:32.072 --> 00:09:36.367
Turn here, turn there,
pick this up, leave that behind.

and walk on till
we cross that line.

You and me. All of us.

[ECHO]
Like we all do.

00:10:10.944 --> 00:10:13.154
We're pulled out of the womb.

00:10:13.196 --> 00:10:14.739
And we cry.

00:10:14.781 --> 00:10:16.908
We pass on and cry again.

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:19.369

[ECHO] Thank you. Man,
today was another tough one.

00:10:41.307 --> 00:10:43.226
[ECHO] I don't know if
the milk turned sour or what,

00:10:43.268 --> 00:10:45.520
but the calf was
refusing to nurse.

00:10:45.562 --> 00:10:48.314
Thought it might help if
I gave her a good brushing.

00:10:48.356 --> 00:10:51.860
Echo, are you enjoying
the life you found here?

00:10:51.901 --> 00:10:56.823
Uh, yeah. Thanks to you,
it wasn't hard to adjust.

00:10:56.865 --> 00:10:59.200
I'd say I could live out
my whole life like this.

00:10:59.242 --> 00:11:02.579
Good. Then could I have that?

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:07.750
Huh? Oh. Do you
mean this? What for?

00:11:07.792 --> 00:11:09.544

So, no?

Sorry.

Where are we?

[JANIS]
The Crossroads.

00:11:34.235 --> 00:11:35.069
This is the place where

00:12:24.869 --> 00:12:27.080
All you can ever know about 'em

00:12:27.121 --> 00:12:28.623
is the little pieces
you pick up on

00:12:28.665 --> 00:12:30.667
in the moments
your paths cross.

00:12:30.708 --> 00:12:32.126
The fragments.

00:12:32.168 --> 00:12:36.506
[gasps] Jimi!

00:12:36.547 --> 00:12:38.424
Since the ancient times.

00:12:38.466 --> 00:12:40.301
this thing has sat
on the borderline

00:12:40.343 --> 00:12:42.804
between humans and the Earless.

00:12:42.845 --> 00:12:46.391
It gives humans the power to
bare what's in their hearts.

00:12:46.432 --> 00:12:47.600
And to the Earless,

00:12:47.642 --> 00:12:50.270
it's a beacon guiding them
to their salvation.

00:12:50.311 --> 00:12:51.729
A beacon?

00:12:51.771 --> 00:12:56.234
[ROBERT] To a chosen few,
the Origin grants power.

00:12:56.276 --> 00:12:59.237
So, do you wanna become a god?

00:12:59.279 --> 00:13:02.824
Or instead, you could let
the Devil take your soul.

00:13:04.158 --> 00:13:08.037
I think those are
both beyond me.

00:13:08.079 --> 00:13:11.291
I'm just here.
All worries and doubts.

00:13:11.332 --> 00:13:13.459
There's nothing else to me.

00:13:13.501 --> 00:13:14.877
Oh yeah?

00:13:22.176 --> 00:13:26.180
Janis told me those
things were memories?

00:13:26.222 --> 00:13:28.725
[ROBERT] That's right.
Memories that the Origin

00:13:28.766 --> 00:13:32.020
carried with it
from a time long gone.

00:13:40.069 --> 00:13:42.780
[ECHO gasps]

00:13:43.656 --> 00:13:45.491
Huh?

00:13:45.533 --> 00:13:48.077
[ROBERT] There's a connection
between us and them,

00:13:48.119 --> 00:13:50.455
and it's gone
on the way it began.

00:13:50.496 --> 00:13:52.832
Chaos keeps winning
out over order.

00:13:52.874 --> 00:13:56.210
It starts and stops
instead of rolling steady.

00:13:56.252 --> 00:13:57.754
The only thing
that stays constant

00:13:57.795 --> 00:14:00.548
is the way it's
always changing.

00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:03.134
'Cause that's the path we chose.

00:14:04.218 --> 00:14:06.095
[ROBERT]
One day far in the past,

00:14:06.137 --> 00:14:09.390
the Earless appeared
suddenly, without warning.

00:14:09.432 --> 00:14:11.934
We humans saw them
roaming the earth,

00:14:11.976 --> 00:14:14.437
like they were searching
for something.

00:14:14.479 --> 00:14:16.606
We didn't know what
to make of 'em at first.

00:14:16.647 --> 00:14:19.359
We treated 'em as curiosities.

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:22.653
But then. We saw what
they were capable of.

00:14:22.695 --> 00:14:26.324
In that moment,
everything changed.

00:14:26.366 --> 00:14:28.993
The Earless were
a force of nature.

00:14:29.035 --> 00:14:31.954
There was nothing
we could do but pray.

00:14:31.996 --> 00:14:35.083
And so, that's exactly
what we did.

00:14:35.124 --> 00:14:38.086
And it seemed like the
heavens heard our prayers

00:14:38.127 --> 00:14:41.672
and gave us an answer
in the Origin.

00:14:41.714 --> 00:14:45.760
Its light gave rise to the
cores of the first Equipment.

00:14:45.802 --> 00:14:48.221
Humans could fight back at last,

00:14:48.262 --> 00:14:50.139
and the passion
burning in our hearts

00:14:50.181 --> 00:14:53.101
led many Earless
to their salvation.

00:14:53.142 --> 00:14:55.353
But the ugliness.

00:14:55.395 --> 00:14:58.481
The hatred and rage that
smolders in our souls.

00:14:58.523 --> 00:15:02.568
It only fed the Earless, and
made them fight back harder.

00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:05.488
My people,
the people of Blues.

00:15:05.530 --> 00:15:07.407
We wanted to put an
end to the fighting,

00:15:07.448 --> 00:15:09.784
and half of us died trying.

00:15:09.826 --> 00:15:12.912
One of the survivors
stepped forward.

00:15:12.954 --> 00:15:15.790
Just an ordinary young man
from the country.

00:15:15.832 --> 00:15:18.918
That young man was determined
to protect our world,

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:23.673
and he was gonna do it even
if it meant selling his soul.

00:15:23.714 --> 00:15:27.802
[JIMI] It wasn't some big story.
I just had questions.

00:15:27.844 --> 00:15:30.304
Why did things end up this way?

00:15:30.346 --> 00:15:32.265
What were the Earless?

00:15:33.349 --> 00:15:35.893
[JIMI]
So I went looking for answers.

00:15:35.935 --> 00:15:38.062
And from there, well,

00:15:38.104 --> 00:15:40.898
it was like pulling leaves
off a head of cabbage.

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:44.444
Or peeling an onion,
layer by layer.

00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:56.122
[MU growls]

00:15:56.164 --> 00:16:00.585
It's true. You've all been
hearing us from the start.

00:16:00.626 --> 00:16:03.171
We were the ones
who refused to listen.

00:16:03.212 --> 00:16:05.882
We got scared and
covered our ears.

00:16:05.923 --> 00:16:09.135
I will embrace your
anger. Listeners.

Mu!

00:16:36.621 --> 00:16:39.665
[ROBERT] They came into
this world without a name.

00:16:39.707 --> 00:16:42.210
We were the ones who
called them "Earless."

00:16:42.251 --> 00:16:45.421
Maybe out of affection.
Maybe animosity.

00:16:45.463 --> 00:16:50.259
But to them, that name was
just a mark of our arrogance.

00:16:50.301 --> 00:16:54.263
[ECHO] Maybe this is my own
arrogance, but I don't care.

Uh‐‐ Gone where?

What you saw were the memories

00:17:36.764 --> 00:17:40.601
held by the Origin
since creation.

00:17:40.643 --> 00:17:42.019
And Grandpa.

00:17:42.061 --> 00:17:45.231
He was one of those memories
that lingers on here.

how to say this, but...

Maybe not. But still.
