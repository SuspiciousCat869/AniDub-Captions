00:00:09.635 --> 00:00:11.720
[DENKA]
Project Freedom.

00:00:11.762 --> 00:00:13.305
The time has come
for us to strike

00:00:13.347 --> 00:00:15.641
the killing blow
and end this war.

00:00:15.682 --> 00:00:17.142
First, the Mystics will summon

00:00:17.184 --> 00:00:19.186
the Earless Core
to our location,

00:00:19.228 --> 00:00:21.480
and then we, my friends,
will wipe it out.

00:00:21.522 --> 00:00:25.400
Wait. The Mystics wish
to coexist with the Earless.

00:00:25.442 --> 00:00:26.485
Have you told them of your goal?

00:00:26.527 --> 00:00:28.487
[DENKA]
Sign o' the times.

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.656
Their sacrifice will
lay down the cornerstone

00:00:30.697 --> 00:00:32.115
for a brighter future.

00:00:32.157 --> 00:00:33.158
You'd deceive them?

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.785
That's not my intent.

00:00:34.826 --> 00:00:37.454
Ultimately, we have to
eliminate the Earless.

00:00:37.496 --> 00:00:40.624
We can only preserve our
existence by ending theirs.

00:00:40.666 --> 00:00:43.043
Does His Majesty agree?

00:00:43.085 --> 00:00:46.797
Now then, how about we
all welcome our guests?

00:00:46.838 --> 00:00:48.549
People of Gnome!

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:55.097
And who are you?

00:00:55.138 --> 00:00:58.600
[JIMI] I feel your radiance,
but no love in it.

00:01:01.603 --> 00:01:03.814
[DENKA] That was the
beginning of the 15 days

00:01:03.855 --> 00:01:06.483
and seven hours
he and I would share.

00:01:08.026 --> 00:01:10.696
[DENKA] A moment that
seemed like an eternity,

00:01:10.737 --> 00:01:12.698
till love abandoned you.

00:01:12.739 --> 00:01:14.741
That was ten years ago.

00:01:14.783 --> 00:01:17.953
The revolution of love
is at a standstill.

00:01:17.995 --> 00:01:21.790
There's something
we've missed, but what?

00:01:30.882 --> 00:01:33.844
I can hear the doves crying out.

00:01:33.885 --> 00:01:35.429
[DENKA]
Can you, Jimi?

00:03:13.235 --> 00:03:15.570
[ECHO]
Echo Rec. Fifteen years old.

00:03:15.612 --> 00:03:19.157
I'm from Liverchester.
It's nice to meet you.

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:20.992
You know what kinda guy we need?

00:03:21.034 --> 00:03:23.328
Guy with a sense of
cool and a lotta guts.

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.956
Like a friggin' wild
and crazy wolf, a'right?

00:03:25.997 --> 00:03:27.999
[ECHO] Well I'm kinda
outta money, so.

00:03:28.041 --> 00:03:31.461
So, hey, my name is Mu,
and I have no idea

00:03:31.503 --> 00:03:33.338
how old I am or
where I came from.

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:34.881
Well, what we're
looking for right now

00:03:34.923 --> 00:03:37.050
is a hot and hip
young woman, see?

00:03:37.092 --> 00:03:39.886
Like a friggin' sweet,
sexy little kitten, a'right?

00:03:39.928 --> 00:03:42.431
[MU] And we're looking
for a place to stay, so.

00:03:42.472 --> 00:03:44.307
Wha? Oh, my strengths?

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:46.226
Well I like messing
with machines,

00:03:46.268 --> 00:03:48.937
and I guess I've also barbacked
for my sister a few times.

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:50.564
Have I ever had a job?

00:03:50.605 --> 00:03:52.441
I mean... I guess not?

00:03:52.482 --> 00:03:54.484
Right now? Yeah, I'm alone.

00:03:54.526 --> 00:03:56.319
I was traveling
with someone, but...

00:03:56.361 --> 00:03:58.739
I set that money aside
for parts to fix up the amp,

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:00.907
and she basically
threw it all away!

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:03.285
He kept whining about his
stupid lower back pain,

00:04:03.326 --> 00:04:05.495
so I bought him a super
soft futon to sleep on!

00:04:05.537 --> 00:04:07.414
It's not like I even
asked her for it.

00:04:07.456 --> 00:04:09.875
Those futons are
a complete waste of money!

00:04:09.916 --> 00:04:12.210
[BOTH]
Seriously! What the hell?

00:04:12.252 --> 00:04:14.838
[RESERVOIR]
Hmm. You're in!

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.214
Wow. Thanks a lot!

00:04:16.256 --> 00:04:17.591
Now. Please follow me.

00:04:17.632 --> 00:04:18.842
Oh. Sure.

00:04:18.884 --> 00:04:19.676
All right!

00:04:19.718 --> 00:04:21.595
Great. I'll lead the way.

00:04:21.636 --> 00:04:22.888
Cool!

00:04:23.764 --> 00:04:27.017
[ECHO]
Paisley Park. It's amazing.

00:04:27.058 --> 00:04:28.268
Who could've imagined?

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:29.269
It's so big.

00:04:29.311 --> 00:04:31.813
In this town,
everyone can be sexy.

00:04:31.855 --> 00:04:34.316
And Denka, the most
Lovesexy of all

00:04:34.357 --> 00:04:37.360
the beautiful people in this
world of ours, lives up there.

00:04:37.402 --> 00:04:38.570
Huh?

00:04:40.781 --> 00:04:43.492
[WENDY]
It's called the Galaxy Palace.

00:04:43.533 --> 00:04:46.453
Wow. The Galaxy Palace.

00:04:46.495 --> 00:04:48.830
Uh‐‐ Whoa. 'Scuse me.

00:04:48.872 --> 00:04:50.457
And, we've arrived.

00:04:50.499 --> 00:04:52.709
This'll be your dorm.

00:04:52.751 --> 00:04:54.294
[LISA]
You're a Player, aren't you?

00:04:54.336 --> 00:04:57.297
[MU]
You could tell? Yeah.

00:04:57.339 --> 00:05:00.425
So do you know how I
might get to meet Denka?

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:02.302
Uh...

00:05:02.344 --> 00:05:05.222
[LISA] I suppose you'd
have to lead a sexy life.

00:05:05.263 --> 00:05:07.015
Just let the love be your guide.

00:05:07.057 --> 00:05:08.975
This place is
overflowing with it.

00:05:09.017 --> 00:05:12.270
Feel that? It's
Paisley Park, babe.

00:05:12.312 --> 00:05:15.273
We're here. You'll be
staying in this dorm.

00:05:15.315 --> 00:05:16.650

Are you for real?

00:05:24.241 --> 00:05:26.243
Look, just...
stay on your side.

00:05:26.284 --> 00:05:28.620
Why don't you stay on your side?

00:05:29.621 --> 00:05:32.040
I'm going to bed early.
I got work.

Yeah, me too.

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.127
And I'm gonna sleep great
on my new futon!

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:38.672
Hey, didn't you tell me
you got that for my back pain?

00:05:38.713 --> 00:05:42.467
Hey, didn't you tell me that
I'd wasted your money on a scam?

00:05:46.388 --> 00:05:47.848
[ECHO]
Great, we've got work.

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:49.850
But we came to
this town for a reason,

so don't get sidetracked.

00:05:51.476 --> 00:05:52.894

Dude, shut up.

00:05:52.936 --> 00:05:55.438
You just worry about getting us
a meeting with that Denka guy.

00:09:16.306 --> 00:09:19.684
Oh, me? Call me the Kid.

00:09:19.726 --> 00:09:20.727
Okay...

00:09:20.769 --> 00:09:23.021
Let's Go Crazy!

00:09:24.439 --> 00:09:27.150
[DENKA] Paisley Park is a place
for people to come together.

00:09:27.192 --> 00:09:30.153
No matter their creed or color,
all are welcome here.

00:09:30.195 --> 00:09:32.697
Look around.
A smile on every face.

00:09:32.739 --> 00:09:35.533
You can see the pleasure etched
deeply into their hearts.

00:09:35.575 --> 00:09:38.286
And if you ask them
where they're going?

00:09:38.328 --> 00:09:39.120
Huh?

00:09:39.162 --> 00:09:41.831
I bet they'll all tell you
they're going nowhere.

00:09:41.873 --> 00:09:44.167
Because they've already
taken out a lifetime lease

00:09:44.209 --> 00:09:46.836
right here on Paisley Park.

00:09:48.713 --> 00:09:50.423
[DENKA]
Jimi Stonefree?

00:09:50.465 --> 00:09:52.383
[ECHO] I didn't figure
you'd know him.

00:09:52.425 --> 00:09:53.718
He's a legend among Players,

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:56.012
but he's not listed in
the almanac or anything.

00:09:56.054 --> 00:09:58.306
[DENKA] Really? Like some
kind of urban myth.

00:09:58.348 --> 00:09:59.891
[ECHO]
Except he's real.

00:09:59.933 --> 00:10:03.520
I saw him myself, ten years ago,
in Liverchester.

00:10:03.561 --> 00:10:06.064
[DENKA]
Hm. Liverchester, you say?

00:10:06.106 --> 00:10:08.566
We heard that Denka
knew about him,

00:10:08.608 --> 00:10:10.276
but how's a guy like me
get an appointment

00:10:10.318 --> 00:10:12.946
with someone who lives
in a flying palace?

00:10:12.987 --> 00:10:14.322
What do you hope to do?

00:10:14.364 --> 00:10:15.156
Huh?

00:10:15.198 --> 00:10:16.908
[DENKA]
When you meet this Jimi.

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:21.037
I... I don't know. But‐‐

00:10:21.079 --> 00:10:23.414
You want him to
guide you, right?

00:10:23.456 --> 00:10:26.084
I felt the same way.

00:10:26.126 --> 00:10:28.461
All I wanted was to
save this hollow world,

00:10:28.503 --> 00:10:30.380
but it went so wrong.

00:10:30.421 --> 00:10:31.506
[ECHO]
Mister Kid?

00:10:31.548 --> 00:10:33.675
[DENKA] I never meant to
cause you any sorrow or pain,

00:10:33.716 --> 00:10:35.927
but that doesn't matter.

00:10:35.969 --> 00:10:38.138
Love has fallen still.

00:10:39.139 --> 00:10:40.890
[DENKA]
And yet...

00:10:40.932 --> 00:10:43.643
I can feel the same love
in your radiance, boy.

00:10:43.685 --> 00:10:44.477
Huh?

00:10:44.519 --> 00:10:46.938
It's burning for that girl, Mu.

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:47.814
[ECHO gasps]

00:10:47.856 --> 00:10:50.441
Isn't it? She's the reason
you left your hometown

00:10:50.483 --> 00:10:52.318
and started out on
this journey, right?

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:54.696
You knew you wanted to stay
with her, so you came along.

00:10:54.737 --> 00:10:56.156
[ECHO] It's not what you're
making it sound like!

00:10:56.197 --> 00:10:57.949
I'm glad you told me all that.

00:10:57.991 --> 00:11:01.327
Your story moved feelings
in me that I forgot I had.

00:11:01.369 --> 00:11:03.788
Allow me to repay you.

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:06.291
Club Love Sexy?

00:11:06.332 --> 00:11:09.127
[DENKA] My treat.
Now, go, and speak of love.

00:11:09.169 --> 00:11:11.796
[ECHO]
Whoa, um. I don't know about‐‐

00:11:11.838 --> 00:11:14.299
Till next time, Boy Nine.

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:15.758
[STORE CLERK 5A]
Welcome, sir.

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:18.553
Smooth and creamy.
Moist and steamy.

00:11:18.595 --> 00:11:20.763
Most soft and, and, and...

00:11:20.805 --> 00:11:22.390
Sir, your booth is available.

[ECHO squeals]

00:11:23.308 --> 00:11:25.685
[STORE CLERK 5A] Please make
your way to Girl Six.

00:11:25.727 --> 00:11:27.145
[MU]
Hey!

00:11:27.187 --> 00:11:28.771
Um. Hello.

00:11:28.813 --> 00:11:32.567
I'm... It's really
nice to mee‐‐ Mu?

00:11:32.609 --> 00:11:34.402
[BOTH]
Huh?

00:11:34.444 --> 00:11:37.238
[MU] For real, how do
men's brains even work?

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:39.407
You got paid and
came to this place?

00:11:39.449 --> 00:11:40.742
Well, I mean...

00:11:40.783 --> 00:11:42.160
I didn't expect to
run into you here.

00:11:42.202 --> 00:11:44.120
Oh. Okay.

00:11:44.162 --> 00:11:46.039
So you were hoping to
meet some other girl, then.

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:48.166
Uh‐‐ I... That wasn't...

00:11:48.208 --> 00:11:49.667
[LISA]
Hey there, you two.

00:11:49.709 --> 00:11:50.501
‐‐Huh?
‐‐What?

00:11:50.543 --> 00:11:53.713
Let us take you
somewhere nice.

00:11:53.755 --> 00:11:55.673
[ECHO]
First Avenue, huh?

00:11:55.715 --> 00:11:58.384
[LISA] That's right.
Normally, this is a coliseum

00:11:58.426 --> 00:12:01.346
where Players take each other
on in exhibition matches.

00:12:01.387 --> 00:12:03.890
[WENDY] You're a Player,
aren't you, Girl Six?

00:12:03.932 --> 00:12:06.893
[LISA]
And Boy Nine is an amp builder.

00:12:06.935 --> 00:12:07.936
[BOTH gasp]

00:12:07.977 --> 00:12:10.438
We're also Players,
just like you.

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:11.940
Now we're gonna fight.

00:12:11.981 --> 00:12:13.691
[WENDY] You're here to meet
with Denka, aren't you?

00:12:13.733 --> 00:12:15.443
[LISA] Beat us and
we'll make that happen.

00:12:15.485 --> 00:12:17.111
[ECHO]
WHa‐‐ For real?

00:12:17.153 --> 00:12:18.112
[MU]
If we lose?

00:12:18.154 --> 00:12:21.157
[LISA chuckles] If you lose,
you get thrown outta town.

00:12:21.199 --> 00:12:23.117
That's what happens when
a new Player shows up

00:12:23.159 --> 00:12:26.287
from the sticks and tries to
debut straight out of the gate.

00:12:26.329 --> 00:12:28.539
I don't understand.
What about a "debut"?

00:12:28.581 --> 00:12:30.792
If you wanna fight, you got it!

00:12:30.833 --> 00:12:32.001
Mu?

00:12:40.301 --> 00:12:41.636
[sighs]

00:12:41.678 --> 00:12:44.472
Just think of it like putting
your money into savings.

00:12:44.514 --> 00:12:46.224
[ECHO] I need it back when
the next check comes in.

00:12:46.266 --> 00:12:49.185
Yeah, life's like that
sometimes. Right?

00:12:49.227 --> 00:12:51.020
And how'd it go at First Avenue?

00:12:51.062 --> 00:12:54.148
[ECHO sighs]
We got absolutely spanked.

00:13:03.449 --> 00:13:06.369
[MARSHALL] First Avenue's
Amazon Corps, huh?

00:13:07.954 --> 00:13:10.415
You do understand that
folks call Wendy and Lisa

00:13:10.456 --> 00:13:13.334
"the immortal queens"
for a reason, don'tcha kid?

00:13:13.376 --> 00:13:16.170
Hell, I'm surprised you
made it outta there alive.

00:13:16.212 --> 00:13:18.798
I didn't know they were
the Wendy and Lisa.

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:20.341
They were dressed totally
different than they are

00:13:20.383 --> 00:13:22.010
in the almanac, for one thing.

00:13:22.051 --> 00:13:24.262
Well, then, guess you
gotta head home.

00:13:24.304 --> 00:13:25.888
No way!

00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:27.515
Aw, too bad, so sad.

00:13:27.557 --> 00:13:30.143
Now, head back to your
dorm and get packed up.

00:13:31.352 --> 00:13:33.062
[BOTH gasp]

00:13:33.104 --> 00:13:34.355
[ECHO]
We can't leave yet!

00:13:34.397 --> 00:13:37.025
Give us one more chance.
A week from now!

00:13:37.066 --> 00:13:38.943
Echo, are you...?

00:13:38.985 --> 00:13:39.902
[ECHO]
Please.

00:13:39.944 --> 00:13:42.655
It's really important that
we get to talk to Denka!

00:13:42.697 --> 00:13:45.366
I'm begging you.
One more shot!

00:13:45.408 --> 00:13:47.994
Wow, Boy Nine. Nicely said.

00:13:48.036 --> 00:13:50.371
Well, Girl Six?
Are you in or out?

00:13:50.413 --> 00:13:52.874
I'm in. We'll get you back!

00:13:52.915 --> 00:13:54.959
[chuckles] I like these two.

00:13:55.001 --> 00:13:58.087
Yeah. How 'bout we
do it big next time?

00:13:59.505 --> 00:14:02.008
[ECHO] All I wanted was
to meet with Denka.

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:03.384
How did it end up like this?

00:14:03.426 --> 00:14:04.552
[MU]
Who cares?

00:14:04.594 --> 00:14:07.638
It did and we're here, and it's
too late to back down now.

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:10.141
[ECHO]
Yeah, but what if we lose again?

00:14:10.183 --> 00:14:11.768
[MU]
We're not gonna lose.

00:14:11.809 --> 00:14:13.519
We're gonna win, meet Denka,

00:14:13.561 --> 00:14:15.313
and find out what
he knows about Jimi.

00:14:15.355 --> 00:14:18.316
[DENKA] You're a cute pair,
Team Six‐Nine.

00:14:18.358 --> 00:14:21.402
All right then.
Guess you've got a plan?

00:14:21.444 --> 00:14:23.821
Yeah. When we fought before,

00:14:23.863 --> 00:14:25.698
we realized that their
special piloting technique

00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:27.450
where they trade off
control of their Equipment

00:14:27.492 --> 00:14:28.993
gives them certain advantages.

00:14:29.035 --> 00:14:31.037
Just when you get into the flow.

00:14:31.079 --> 00:14:33.122
It's like you blink and
suddenly you're up against

00:14:33.164 --> 00:14:34.499
a whole different opponent.

00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:36.376
Right. That's the trick.

00:14:36.417 --> 00:14:38.795
For half a second, when they
switch, they're vulnerable.

00:14:38.836 --> 00:14:41.047
Too much thinking going on here.

00:14:41.089 --> 00:14:43.007
You're not in
class anymore, kids,

00:14:43.049 --> 00:14:45.843
you're trying to
kick off a revolution.

00:14:45.885 --> 00:14:47.678
And like you,
I used only focus on

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:49.972
overpowering my opponent.

00:14:50.014 --> 00:14:51.933
But you two got
my gears turning.

00:14:51.974 --> 00:14:52.809
Whaddaya mean?

00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:54.936
Love and hatred sit on a seesaw,

00:14:54.977 --> 00:14:57.897
rocking back and forth
on the fulcrum of the heart.

00:14:57.939 --> 00:15:00.233
Like the balance between
Player and amp builder?

00:15:00.274 --> 00:15:01.609
Oh, not at all.

00:15:01.651 --> 00:15:04.320
I'd say you two are
perfectly in balance.

00:15:04.362 --> 00:15:06.948
Now you just need to
face each other.

00:15:08.199 --> 00:15:09.700
This'll be fun.

00:15:09.742 --> 00:15:11.744
I'll be sure to come watch.

00:15:14.455 --> 00:15:17.667
Now, Mu. I finally get it.

00:15:17.708 --> 00:15:21.087
[DENKA] That pendant
always belonged to you.

00:15:21.129 --> 00:15:23.631
It's true. Time has passed.

00:15:23.673 --> 00:15:26.467
The day has come for
something new to begin.

00:15:26.509 --> 00:15:29.429
It was love we were missing,
just as I thought.

00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:33.307
And we need a revolution
for a new love to take root.

00:15:35.643 --> 00:15:37.520
[BURLY MAN]
You seem awfully confident.

00:15:37.562 --> 00:15:40.064
[MARSHALL] What can I say,
I'm a risk‐taker.

00:15:40.106 --> 00:15:42.942
Gonna put everything
I've got on Wendy and Lisa.

00:15:42.984 --> 00:15:44.819
[BURLY MAN] If you win,
you better pay me.

00:15:44.861 --> 00:15:46.487
Bet your ass I will!

00:15:46.529 --> 00:15:49.031
I'm not the one
whose ass is on the line.

what are we gonna do,

what are we gonna do,
what are we gonna do?

00:15:53.077 --> 00:15:54.954
[MU]
We're gonna win the match.

00:15:54.996 --> 00:15:56.164
We can't throw away this chance

00:15:56.205 --> 00:15:58.374
after you groveled
so hard for it.

00:15:58.416 --> 00:16:00.168
No way we're losing!

00:16:00.209 --> 00:16:02.837
You're right. We got this!

00:16:20.771 --> 00:16:22.023

I hear you all saying
that you want a leader.

00:16:37.955 --> 00:16:39.874
But you can't make seem to
make up your mind,

00:16:39.916 --> 00:16:41.959
so I think you better let go.

00:16:41.959 --> 00:16:44.754
I only wanted to see everybody
laughing in the purple rain,

00:16:44.795 --> 00:16:48.424
but alas, in the end,
I am no leader.

00:16:48.466 --> 00:16:51.594
I am but a Scion of Chills
and a seeker of love!

00:16:51.636 --> 00:16:54.680
[CROWD cheers]

00:16:54.722 --> 00:16:56.182
Then, Mister Kid...

00:16:56.224 --> 00:16:58.017
...was Denka the whole time?

00:16:58.059 --> 00:17:01.187
[DENKA] Let's see it!
Show us your love!

00:17:03.147 --> 00:17:08.236
[DENKA] Now, let us offer a
prayer for a love revolution!

00:17:08.277 --> 00:17:09.278
[LISA]
Let's do it.

00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:10.696
[WENDY]
You ready?

00:17:19.664 --> 00:17:21.499
‐‐Mu!
‐‐I'm fine.

00:17:26.837 --> 00:17:28.589
[LISA gasps]
They caught us!

00:17:28.631 --> 00:17:30.091
Something's changed.

00:17:30.132 --> 00:17:35.096
[CROWD gasps]

00:17:35.137 --> 00:17:36.347
[ECHO]
On my signal, Mu!

00:17:36.389 --> 00:17:37.306
[MU]
Got it.

00:17:37.348 --> 00:17:38.307
Just one shot.

00:17:38.349 --> 00:17:40.268
That's all I need!

00:17:43.771 --> 00:17:45.982
‐‐Lisa's up!
‐‐Let's rock!

00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:53.364
Do it!

00:17:53.406 --> 00:17:56.701
Go, Top Boost!

00:18:00.162 --> 00:18:01.747
[DENKA]
That's the match!

00:18:01.789 --> 00:18:05.543
[CROWD cheers]

00:18:05.585 --> 00:18:08.379
Unbelievable.
They beat the Queens?

00:18:08.421 --> 00:18:09.797
Don't run, Marshall!

00:18:09.839 --> 00:18:11.799
You're gonna
pay me back, you bastard!

00:18:11.841 --> 00:18:14.927
Little rat! The hell?

00:18:16.971 --> 00:18:17.972
[DENKA]
Their love.

00:18:18.014 --> 00:18:19.432
The revolution.

00:18:19.473 --> 00:18:21.350
It's moving again!

00:18:24.895 --> 00:18:25.813
The Earless?

00:18:25.855 --> 00:18:26.981
Huh? But why now?

00:18:27.023 --> 00:18:29.734
[CROWD screams]

00:18:29.775 --> 00:18:31.611
We've got no choice!

00:18:31.652 --> 00:18:33.487
[LISA]
Let's do this, Wendy!

00:18:33.529 --> 00:18:35.823
[WENDY]
We'll give 'em a show!

00:18:35.865 --> 00:18:37.325
[DENKA]
I knew it, Mu.

00:18:37.366 --> 00:18:39.744
You and Jimi are connected.

00:18:39.785 --> 00:18:41.495
Denka. You're in danger!

00:18:41.537 --> 00:18:43.873
Behold. After ten years at rest,

00:18:43.914 --> 00:18:45.374
the revolution
we've been longing for

00:18:45.416 --> 00:18:48.085
has finally been
set in motion again!

00:18:48.127 --> 00:18:51.756
The only thing
it needed was love.

00:18:51.797 --> 00:18:52.798
[DENKA sings]

00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:54.342
[RESERVOIR]
Your Equipment, Denka,

00:18:54.383 --> 00:18:56.802
it's reacting to the Earless.

00:18:56.844 --> 00:19:00.014
[DENKA] It's not. Those kids
and their power did this!

00:19:00.056 --> 00:19:02.808
[sings]

00:19:02.850 --> 00:19:04.143
[WENDY]
There's no end to them!

00:19:04.185 --> 00:19:06.145
[ECHO]
Mu, your pendant.

00:19:06.187 --> 00:19:08.814
Yeah. It's resonating
with something.

00:19:08.856 --> 00:19:10.900
Let's end this in one shot!

00:19:12.318 --> 00:19:15.363
[MU]
Top Boost!

00:19:15.404 --> 00:19:18.783
[DENKA] That's right.
Ten years ago, we failed.

00:19:18.824 --> 00:19:20.451
But, now, these two.

00:19:20.493 --> 00:19:22.745
They'll bring love
to the new world.

00:19:22.787 --> 00:19:25.539
The planet trembles in
the grip of revolution.

00:19:25.581 --> 00:19:27.166
Are you watching, Jimi?

00:19:27.208 --> 00:19:28.167
My Equipment.

00:19:28.209 --> 00:19:29.710
The city itself.

00:19:29.752 --> 00:19:31.879
See it shining for you!

00:19:49.271 --> 00:19:50.898
[DENKA]
I apologize.

00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:53.150
I ended up pushing
you two pretty hard.

00:19:53.192 --> 00:19:54.735
[MU]
What's up with the Earless?

00:19:54.777 --> 00:19:57.154
Where did they
come from? And why?

00:19:57.196 --> 00:19:58.989
[DENKA]
I've got a story to tell you.

00:19:59.031 --> 00:20:01.909
It's about my time
with Jimi Stonefree.

00:20:01.951 --> 00:20:05.996
Every moment of those 15 days
and seven hours of my life.

00:20:06.038 --> 00:20:08.207
This happened ten years ago.

00:20:08.249 --> 00:20:09.333
You've heard about the Fest

00:20:09.375 --> 00:20:11.877
that was held in
Liverchester, haven't you?

00:20:11.919 --> 00:20:14.004
We called it "Project Freedom."

00:20:14.046 --> 00:20:16.048
Our goal was to
eradicate the Earless

00:20:16.090 --> 00:20:18.801
and liberate humankind
from their terror.

00:20:18.843 --> 00:20:20.761
But to do that,
we'd first need to summon

00:20:20.803 --> 00:20:23.764
the Core of the Earless.

00:20:23.806 --> 00:20:26.100
Which was why we needed
to ensure the cooperation

00:20:26.142 --> 00:20:29.937
of a group of people who sought
to coexist with the Earless.

00:20:29.979 --> 00:20:32.231
Of course, had we informed them
of our true intentions

00:20:32.273 --> 00:20:33.733
in throwing this Fest,

00:20:33.774 --> 00:20:36.777
they would certainly never
have agreed to take part.

00:20:36.819 --> 00:20:38.195
You lied to them?

00:20:38.237 --> 00:20:40.072
That's the sad truth.

00:20:40.114 --> 00:20:44.368
At the time, another Player had
joined the war alongside them.

00:20:45.244 --> 00:20:46.912
Jimi?

00:20:46.954 --> 00:20:48.873
[JIMI hums]

00:20:48.914 --> 00:20:50.916
[DENKA]
Our revolution won't fail.

00:20:50.958 --> 00:20:53.127
We're gonna bring
peace to the world.

00:20:54.086 --> 00:20:55.755
[JIMI]
Can you hear them?

00:20:55.796 --> 00:20:57.339
Their voices.

00:20:57.381 --> 00:20:58.841
[DENKA]
Hm?

00:20:58.883 --> 00:21:02.595
[JIMI] They cry out endlessly,
from deep in our hearts.

00:21:02.636 --> 00:21:04.847
But one day we can
all love each other.

00:21:04.889 --> 00:21:06.015
Even them.

00:21:06.056 --> 00:21:08.476
[DENKA]
The Earless and us?

00:21:08.517 --> 00:21:10.144
Yeah, Of course.

00:21:10.186 --> 00:21:12.271
We're all the same.

00:21:12.313 --> 00:21:14.523
What made you decide
to be a Player?

00:21:14.565 --> 00:21:17.818
Whenever I played, my little
sister would start dancing.

00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:19.528
Twirled around. Laughed.

00:21:19.570 --> 00:21:21.989
It was totally adorable!

00:21:22.031 --> 00:21:24.867
Oh, I wish you could meet her
someday down the line.

00:21:24.909 --> 00:21:27.703
[DENKA] And in those days,
dangling from his neck,

00:21:27.745 --> 00:21:29.914
was the same shining
pendant you wear.

00:21:29.955 --> 00:21:31.123
[BOTH gasp]

00:21:31.165 --> 00:21:32.750
[DENKA]
We'd made a mistake.

00:21:32.792 --> 00:21:34.627
But it was too late
to change course.

00:21:34.668 --> 00:21:37.463
The operation was in motion.

00:21:37.505 --> 00:21:41.258
We betrayed him, and what's
more, we still failed.

00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:43.010
For ten years, I've been
waiting for a chance

00:21:43.052 --> 00:21:44.804
to set it all right.

00:21:45.930 --> 00:21:47.473
But my time is past.

00:21:47.515 --> 00:21:49.850
This era belongs to you two.

00:21:49.892 --> 00:21:51.852
That's everything
I know of Jimi.

00:21:51.894 --> 00:21:54.146
I haven't seen him
again since that day.

00:21:54.188 --> 00:21:55.648
He left the battlefield injured,

00:21:55.689 --> 00:21:57.983
along with the
people from Gnome.

00:21:58.025 --> 00:21:59.318
They're the only ones
who would know

00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:00.820
where he went from there.

00:22:00.861 --> 00:22:02.696
And after our betrayal,
they would never be willing

00:22:02.738 --> 00:22:04.573
to come to the table with us.

00:22:04.615 --> 00:22:06.325
But you. That's a
different matter.

00:22:06.367 --> 00:22:07.326
[ECHO gasps]

00:22:07.368 --> 00:22:09.119
This'll get you to Gnome,

00:22:09.161 --> 00:22:11.956
though I don't know what you
might find after ten years.

00:22:11.997 --> 00:22:15.793
[ECHO giggles]
Thank you, Mister Kid. Truly!

00:22:15.835 --> 00:22:19.088
[DENKA] I have one more
request before you go.

00:22:20.130 --> 00:22:23.634
[ECHO] The country of Gnome.
That's where we'll find Jimi!

00:22:25.719 --> 00:22:29.181
[MU]
Am I really his little sister?

00:22:29.223 --> 00:22:33.143
[DENKA] If by chance, you do
happen to find your way to Jimi.

00:22:33.185 --> 00:22:35.980
Please tell him I said this.

00:22:36.021 --> 00:22:40.150
Even still, I've never
stopped loving him.

00:24:11.909 --> 00:24:13.661
[JIMI] If we zig‐zagged
away from the world

00:24:13.702 --> 00:24:15.245
and laid down new tracks,

00:24:15.287 --> 00:24:18.207
some would surely call
what we made "progress."

00:24:18.248 --> 00:24:20.918
But if the world were to
be freed from Heaven's rule,

00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:23.212
if it were to reveal
its dark side,

00:24:23.253 --> 00:24:25.381
the future would
cease to be the future.

00:24:25.422 --> 00:24:28.592
The front would move back,
and the back would come forward.

00:24:28.634 --> 00:24:30.052
The stars above
would crystallize

00:24:30.094 --> 00:24:32.137
and cut like crazy diamonds.

00:24:32.179 --> 00:24:34.556
So let's build the wall up
higher and higher,

00:24:34.598 --> 00:24:36.475
till we've shut out the sky.

00:24:36.517 --> 00:24:38.060
"Goodbye Blue Sky."

00:24:38.102 --> 00:24:41.021
Turn your face skyward,
to the Player's night.
