That sound.

00:00:29.321 --> 00:00:32.241
The one reverberating
through my head that day.

00:00:32.282 --> 00:00:33.992
What was it?

Waste.

Junk.

00:01:05.816 --> 00:01:08.569
A sea of trash that
stretches on forever,

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.988
and I live in the middle of it.

00:01:11.029 --> 00:01:12.614
There was a time long ago

00:01:12.656 --> 00:01:15.242
when the world revolved
around this place.

00:01:15.284 --> 00:01:19.371
Or at least that's what I hear
from the old timers in town.

00:01:19.413 --> 00:01:21.164
But if that's how things were,

00:01:21.206 --> 00:01:23.083
you'd never know
by looking at it.

00:01:23.125 --> 00:01:25.919
There's hardly anybody left here
apart from us day laborers

00:01:25.961 --> 00:01:27.879
digging through the junk piles.

00:01:27.921 --> 00:01:30.382
The outside hasn't
forgotten us, though.

00:01:30.424 --> 00:01:32.884
They just know us as the
world's biggest trash heap.

00:01:32.926 --> 00:01:34.886
[MCGEE] Look alive,
friends, this will be

00:01:34.928 --> 00:01:37.681
the final shipment
for the afternoon!

00:01:37.723 --> 00:01:41.101
Keep a sharp eye out
for anything valuable!

00:01:41.143 --> 00:01:43.353
If you fell short of
your quota last month,

00:01:43.395 --> 00:01:45.480
today's your last
chance to make it up,

00:01:45.522 --> 00:01:48.233
else you're eating
a hefty penalty!

00:01:48.984 --> 00:01:53.363
Got it? Now keep digging,
and take these words to heart!

00:01:53.405 --> 00:01:55.490
In this world, to stay alive...

00:01:55.532 --> 00:01:57.618
Ya gotta stay working.

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.746
Don't look to the sky,
keep your eyes down.

00:02:00.787 --> 00:02:03.832
Your mind in the present,
not in your dreams.

00:02:03.874 --> 00:02:07.336
That way of living is
Liverchester's pride.

00:02:07.377 --> 00:02:09.046
And also our promise.

00:02:09.087 --> 00:02:12.299

Oh sure. It's been
a great day for me!

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:20.140
How could it not be?

00:02:20.182 --> 00:02:22.809
After all, a shipment
came in from Lucia!

00:02:22.851 --> 00:02:25.395
Linchpin of the North.
That's the good stuff.

00:02:25.437 --> 00:02:28.523
And it's home to Bilin, one of
the best Players in the world!

00:02:28.565 --> 00:02:30.400
Getting the chance to
find parts from Lucia.

00:02:30.442 --> 00:02:32.361
It's like a dream come true!

00:02:32.402 --> 00:02:35.072
See her? She's the
Crimson Belle, Bilin!

00:02:35.113 --> 00:02:36.907
Man, look at that Equipment.

00:02:36.948 --> 00:02:37.866
It gives me goosebumps!

I haven't thought about being

00:02:44.956 --> 00:02:48.502
I like it in the junk heap, the
way the parts feel in my hands.

00:02:48.543 --> 00:02:50.545
When I look at one,
I can imagine

00:02:50.587 --> 00:02:53.173
the things it's done and
all the places it's seen.

00:02:53.215 --> 00:02:55.384
It's amazing when
you think about it.

00:02:55.425 --> 00:02:57.886
Really, if I can scrape
together an okay living

00:02:57.928 --> 00:03:01.598
digging these guys up,
I'll be happy.

That's why I'll be

Hey, Echo. I think things are
about to pick up here,

00:08:09.614 --> 00:08:11.616
so would you two
mind taking it upstairs?

00:08:11.658 --> 00:08:14.160

Oh yeah, great idea, let's go!

something fun to do!

00:08:22.502 --> 00:08:24.587
That guy sucks. What's his deal?

00:08:24.629 --> 00:08:28.383
[ECHO] Sorry, the Mayor really
isn't a fan of Players.

00:08:28.425 --> 00:08:29.509
Ugh, that was tense!

[GIRL sighs] Yeah, I'll say.

Huh? Well I couldn't
let him throw you out.

00:08:36.433 --> 00:08:38.101

learn more about you!

Oh man. Sorry, it's just

can take out entire countries.

Wow, that sounds extra rough.

00:09:35.408 --> 00:09:37.452
But for generations,
we've had the Players around

They're the heroes
of this world.

passed down as legends.

Really, no joke?

00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:48.379
Yeah, really!

You're what I aspire to be.

I've been working on it
in my spare time.

What do you mean by
"working on it"?

00:10:05.939 --> 00:10:07.982
Wait, an Equipment

You can build
something that big?

[ECHO] I'm not exactly
sure what I'm doing,

00:10:11.778 --> 00:10:13.655
but I've been grabbing
whatever parts I can find

00:10:13.696 --> 00:10:15.990
in the scrap field trying
to make it into something

00:10:16.032 --> 00:10:19.035
like the ones I've seen. Tada!

00:10:21.204 --> 00:10:23.498
[ECHO]
So, uh, you like it?

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:26.584
I mean. It's kinda
small and, like...

And like?

Uh, lame?

00:10:29.504 --> 00:10:32.215
Yeah, you're not wrong.
If I could get a Core Part,

00:10:32.257 --> 00:10:34.634
I could see it what it
looks like in Gig form.

But either way, it's my
greatest treasure.

00:10:37.679 --> 00:10:39.222
And I've always dreamed
of seeing a Player

00:10:39.264 --> 00:10:40.723
take it into battle one day,

00:10:40.765 --> 00:10:42.433
even if that is
totally unrealistic

like all the people
in town tell me.

This guy here gives me purpose.

00:10:54.112 --> 00:10:56.531

‐‐Right? I'm a Player,

00:11:08.585 --> 00:11:11.671
and you told me that Players

00:11:11.713 --> 00:11:14.048
Um, well I guess it's
technically possible.

00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:15.758
Great, so let's do it!

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:18.845
Man. Listening to the Mayor's
crap got me in a bad mood,

00:11:18.887 --> 00:11:20.638
but hearing you talk
about it made me realize

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:21.973
this whole
"being a Player" thing

00:11:22.015 --> 00:11:23.808
might actually be kinda sick!

00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:26.269
It's not like I've got
anything better to do, ya know?

00:11:26.311 --> 00:11:28.688
Or at least not that
I can remember.

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:30.940
So finish building it and
get it up and running.

00:11:30.982 --> 00:11:33.776
You and me are gonna take
out those Earless together!

00:11:33.818 --> 00:11:35.195
It'll be just like you dreamed!

00:11:35.236 --> 00:11:37.447
Whoa. Hold on, slow down.

00:11:37.488 --> 00:11:39.282
There's no way
that's gonna happen.

00:11:39.324 --> 00:11:40.200
Huh?

00:11:40.241 --> 00:11:43.828
Sorry. I'm just
some guy. That's it.

00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:46.664
I built this thing in my spare
time, but it's not much.

00:11:46.706 --> 00:11:48.041
How to put it...

00:11:48.082 --> 00:11:51.044
I guess I'm okay letting
the dream stay a dream.

00:11:51.085 --> 00:11:53.963
Plus, there aren't any Earless
to fight around here anyway,

00:11:54.005 --> 00:11:56.090
and I don't plan on
going anywhere else.

00:11:56.132 --> 00:11:57.300
I'm sure that being a Player

00:11:57.342 --> 00:11:59.177
will come with
a lot of challenges.

00:11:59.219 --> 00:12:00.929
I'll be cheering you on.

00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:01.930
Once this is finished,

you should definitely
take it with you!

It's prob'ly not as
good as a real one,

00:12:05.767 --> 00:12:07.852
but I bet you can at least
do okay with it for a while

00:12:07.894 --> 00:12:08.811
until you find
a better Equipment‐‐

Dude, come on.

00:12:10.647 --> 00:12:12.106
I thought you said that
building this Equipment

00:12:12.148 --> 00:12:13.900
gave you a purpose.

00:12:13.942 --> 00:12:15.985
But now you're just gonna
let your dream stay a dream,

00:12:16.027 --> 00:12:17.278
and never leave your hometown?

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:18.112
Like, are you scared of

00:12:18.154 --> 00:12:20.198
getting what you want
out of life or what?

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:22.784
Well no. At least that's
not the way I think of it.

00:12:22.825 --> 00:12:24.827

Then why wouldn't we team up?

You're an outsider, a Player!

Oh, wow. I'm gonna die.

Here in the scrapyard.

It's the only place
I ever lived,

and now it's where I'll die.

Is that so bad?

Dying surrounded
by the parts I love

00:17:21.624 --> 00:17:24.252
is about as good as I
could've hoped for, right?

If I'd kept going,

I wouldn't have
amounted to much.

they'll remember me.

Maybe even as, like,
a minor hero. I guess.

I wanted to go places.

00:17:49.694 --> 00:17:51.529
I wanted to see new things.

00:17:51.571 --> 00:17:53.197
I don't care about

[ECHO]
Mayor?

00:20:56.255 --> 00:20:57.798
There was a time
when our country was

00:20:57.840 --> 00:20:59.467
crawling with punks like you.

00:20:59.508 --> 00:21:01.802
Before this world
became what it is now.

00:21:01.844 --> 00:21:04.346
Back when it had
the will to dream.

00:21:04.388 --> 00:21:05.973
But ten years ago,
the day came when

00:21:06.015 --> 00:21:08.392
the sound was taken
from our world.

00:21:08.434 --> 00:21:10.770
Suddenly, everything changed.

00:21:10.853 --> 00:21:12.938
Our country was buried
in broken dreams

00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:15.900
so deep that even the
Earless abandoned us.

00:21:15.941 --> 00:21:18.611
Those left behind could
only trawl the sea of trash

00:21:18.652 --> 00:21:21.113
in hopes of pulling up
enough to live on.

Keep your mind in the present,
not in your dreams!

Such words are the
lights that guide us.

through the darkness,

of Admonishment

Sometimes it's enough
to lend an ear.

everyone seems like

some strange stone statue
that casts no shadow,

00:24:29.468 --> 00:24:31.261
still you found one another.

00:24:31.303 --> 00:24:34.181
Drawn together by the
collective unconscious.

00:24:34.223 --> 00:24:36.350
