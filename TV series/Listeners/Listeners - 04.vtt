WEBVTT

00:00:10.886 --> 00:00:13.764
[NIR] I was all alone
for the longest time.

00:00:13.805 --> 00:00:16.475
A little kid in a cruel world.

00:00:16.517 --> 00:00:20.395
It wasn't easy, learning
how to get along on my own.

00:00:20.437 --> 00:00:23.273
Everyone told me.
"You're a demon child,

00:00:23.315 --> 00:00:26.193
and you draw the Earless
to you like a magnet."

00:00:26.235 --> 00:00:30.322
"There's no place in this world
for somebody like you."

00:00:30.364 --> 00:00:34.409
I thought I was always
gonna be alone, until I died.

00:00:42.834 --> 00:00:45.796
[NIR]
And then I met him.

00:02:31.026 --> 00:02:32.319
This the place?

00:02:32.361 --> 00:02:35.197
Yeah! We're here,
at the legendary school

00:02:35.238 --> 00:02:37.741
that produced some of the
greatest Players in history.

00:02:37.783 --> 00:02:40.077
This is Freak Scene Academy!

00:02:40.118 --> 00:02:41.411
And we're really here!

00:02:41.453 --> 00:02:43.080
How cool is that, Mu?

00:02:43.121 --> 00:02:45.165
Oh yeah, so cool.

00:02:45.207 --> 00:02:48.085
Like a prison for kids. Wait.

00:02:48.126 --> 00:02:48.919
What the hell!

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.170
We're gonna be
walking the same halls

00:02:50.212 --> 00:02:52.673
as Keith Rolling
and Pete Badfinger!

00:02:52.714 --> 00:02:55.258
Man, the vibe here is sick!

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.552
[CHEERLEADERS]
Let's go Freak Scene.

00:02:57.594 --> 00:02:59.971
[MU]
Would you please slow down?

00:03:03.725 --> 00:03:05.394
Yeah, sick vibes.

00:03:05.435 --> 00:03:08.397
As in the actual, "go home and
take something" kinda sick.

00:03:08.438 --> 00:03:09.231
Huh‐‐wha?

00:03:09.272 --> 00:03:11.983
Focus. This isn't a road trip,
we're here for a reason.

00:03:12.025 --> 00:03:13.777
I know. How could I forget?

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:16.363
That Core Part around your neck
is what brought us here.

00:03:16.405 --> 00:03:18.657
The same one used by the
Player we're trying to find.

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:20.450
Jimi Stonefree.

00:03:20.492 --> 00:03:22.661
He may not have an
entry in the almanac,

00:03:22.703 --> 00:03:24.579
but Jimi is still a legend.

00:03:24.621 --> 00:03:25.789
And if we dig around enough,

00:03:25.831 --> 00:03:28.375
there's gotta be some kinda
record on him, right?

00:03:29.251 --> 00:03:30.460
[MU]
True enough.

00:03:30.502 --> 00:03:34.256
Plus, maybe I can find out
more about this power I have.

00:03:40.512 --> 00:03:44.599
[KIM] So your name is Echo Rec?
And you would be Mu.

00:03:47.811 --> 00:03:50.731
[KIM]
I'm so glad you two are here!

00:03:50.772 --> 00:03:53.191
[ECHO]
I can't breathe.

00:03:53.233 --> 00:03:56.111
Please, excuse me.
My name is Kim.

00:03:56.153 --> 00:03:58.613
I serve as the director
of this academy.

00:03:58.655 --> 00:04:01.575
Although, that title
hardly holds any weight.

00:04:01.616 --> 00:04:04.661
None of these little vandals
ever listen to a word I say.

00:04:04.703 --> 00:04:06.246
They just hurl foul
language at me,

00:04:06.288 --> 00:04:08.623
like "haggard (bleep)"
and "used‐up old (bleep)."

00:04:08.665 --> 00:04:11.209
Aw, kids are cruel.

00:04:12.502 --> 00:04:16.006
Now, putting that aside.
You two are Players, right?

00:04:16.047 --> 00:04:18.258
Bilin called ahead,
bless her soul.

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:20.385
She tells me you're very good.

00:04:20.427 --> 00:04:22.345
Yes, I spoke with her yesterday.

00:04:22.387 --> 00:04:24.055
She mentioned
a Player girl named Mu

00:04:24.097 --> 00:04:25.724
might show up at my school.

00:04:25.766 --> 00:04:27.225
And I know what you want.

00:04:27.267 --> 00:04:29.978
Info on the legendary player,
Jimi Stonefree.

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.896
Is that it?

00:04:30.937 --> 00:04:32.481
Ahaha, I'm sorry, young lady.

00:04:32.522 --> 00:04:34.316
But as the director
of this institution,

00:04:34.357 --> 00:04:35.984
I can't give out
an alum's records

00:04:36.026 --> 00:04:37.819
just because someone asked me.

00:04:37.861 --> 00:04:39.321
However.

00:04:41.114 --> 00:04:44.659
[ECHO] What's this?
I've never heard of Teen Spirit.

00:04:44.701 --> 00:04:48.246
I need you to find out how these
spray cans turned up on campus.

00:04:48.288 --> 00:04:51.416
Now how about you kids
take care of that for me?

00:04:51.458 --> 00:04:54.503
There's a nice little
file in it for you!

00:04:54.544 --> 00:04:56.046
Okay, everybody.

00:04:56.087 --> 00:04:58.256
It's time for class,
so please sit down.

00:04:58.298 --> 00:04:59.925
So, uh, maybe we should have

00:04:59.966 --> 00:05:01.885
thought about it
before we agreed?

00:05:01.927 --> 00:05:02.969
If we solve this thing,

00:05:03.011 --> 00:05:05.096
she gives us Jimi's
student records, right?

00:05:05.138 --> 00:05:06.515
So what choice do we have?

00:05:06.556 --> 00:05:07.891
I guess.

00:05:07.933 --> 00:05:08.850
Besides.

00:05:08.892 --> 00:05:11.561
I've never been to school before
so I'm friggin' stoked!

00:05:11.603 --> 00:05:15.315
[KIM] Okay, you two,
come introduce yourselves!

00:05:15.357 --> 00:05:17.359
Um. Hi. Yeah.

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.529
I'm Echo Rec,
and I wanna build amps.

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:22.948
What up, guys!
You can call me Mu.

00:05:22.989 --> 00:05:25.158
It's my first time
doing the school thing.

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:26.159
Good meetin' ya!

00:05:26.201 --> 00:05:27.410
Hey, Mu, where you from?

00:05:27.452 --> 00:05:30.205
‐‐What's your cup size?
‐‐Is that dork your boyfriend?

00:05:30.247 --> 00:05:32.874
For now I'll say just one thing.

00:05:32.916 --> 00:05:34.793
Boys, get at me!

00:05:34.835 --> 00:05:36.461
[STUDENTS chattering]

00:05:36.503 --> 00:05:38.672
Okay. Please settle down.

00:05:38.713 --> 00:05:42.175
Class has started, kids, please!

00:05:42.217 --> 00:05:43.343
[bell rings]

00:05:43.385 --> 00:05:45.470
[STUDENT 4B]
So, where you goin' after this?

00:05:45.512 --> 00:05:47.848
Since we're here, you want us
to show you around campus?

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:49.140
Screw that, man.

00:05:49.182 --> 00:05:50.725
Why don't we go
hit up the diner?

00:05:50.767 --> 00:05:52.060
[STUDENT 4B]
I'm down.

00:05:53.228 --> 00:05:56.231
Easy, boys. You shouldn't
bother this young lady.

00:05:56.273 --> 00:05:58.024
Dude, do I look bothered?

00:05:58.066 --> 00:06:00.735
Seems some of our students
have no manners at all.

00:06:00.777 --> 00:06:03.572
Sorry about that.
My name is Hole.

00:06:03.613 --> 00:06:05.907
I'm the student
council president.

00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:07.868
We need somewhere
quieter to talk.

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:10.871
Boys! Clear a path for us!

00:06:10.912 --> 00:06:12.789
Right, let's go!

00:06:12.831 --> 00:06:13.623
[ECHO]
Wha?

00:06:13.665 --> 00:06:15.083
[STUDENT 4B]
Sure enough, swooping in at

00:06:15.125 --> 00:06:17.127
the last second like always.

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:20.630
What was that about?

00:06:32.434 --> 00:06:34.227
[HOLE] This is the
student council room.

00:06:34.269 --> 00:06:37.355
Though it feels like
a closet. Apologies.

00:06:38.398 --> 00:06:41.693
Now, then. The director
asked you to look into this.

00:06:41.735 --> 00:06:43.820
[MU]
Huh? Uh, well.

00:06:43.862 --> 00:06:46.865
Relax. There's nothing to
get freaked out about.

00:06:46.907 --> 00:06:48.700
It's a can of Teen Spirit.

00:06:48.742 --> 00:06:50.452
You spray some
and breathe it in,

00:06:50.493 --> 00:06:52.370
and it gives you a quick
psychological boost

00:06:52.412 --> 00:06:54.372
and alleviates
feelings of stress.

00:06:54.414 --> 00:06:55.498
From what I've heard,

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:59.044
this stuff was originally
created as a combat stimulant.

00:06:59.085 --> 00:07:01.546
Fighting the Earless is an
extremely demanding job,

00:07:01.588 --> 00:07:03.131
and Players needed an edge.

00:07:03.173 --> 00:07:05.675
But still, this is
no place for it.

00:07:05.717 --> 00:07:08.094
It's a stain on Freak Scene
Academy's legacy,

00:07:08.136 --> 00:07:10.013
and it's really got me
tearing my hair out.

00:07:10.055 --> 00:07:13.058
In other words, you wanna
help us investigate?

00:07:13.099 --> 00:07:14.643
Exactly.

00:07:19.356 --> 00:07:20.398
Huh‐‐

Somebody's following me.

00:07:36.122 --> 00:07:38.083
[ECHO] I wonder.
Has somebody figured out

00:07:38.124 --> 00:07:40.293
that we're looking into
the Teen Spirit thing?

00:07:40.335 --> 00:07:41.795
Are they tailing me?

00:07:41.836 --> 00:07:43.630
In that case...

Hey. Where'd he go?

00:07:47.801 --> 00:07:51.054
C'mon. Man.

00:07:51.096 --> 00:07:52.973
Well that sucks.

00:07:53.014 --> 00:07:53.807
Gotcha!

00:07:53.848 --> 00:07:55.642
I'm sorry! I'm really sorry!

00:07:55.684 --> 00:07:57.769
Hold on. That's right,
you were‐‐

Uh, my name is Nir,
and we're in the same class.

00:08:00.814 --> 00:08:03.525
I was only following you
because I wanna be friends!

00:08:03.566 --> 00:08:05.235
For real?

00:08:06.277 --> 00:08:07.362
[MU]
What is this?

00:08:07.404 --> 00:08:08.655
[HOLE]
It's where the clubs meet,

00:08:08.697 --> 00:08:11.908
and where the slackers go
when they're cutting class.

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:13.243
You first.

00:08:18.623 --> 00:08:20.041

00:08:20.083 --> 00:08:21.710
Hoowee! Hot damn!

00:08:21.751 --> 00:08:24.838
You must be that new gal
we been hearin' about all day!

00:08:24.879 --> 00:08:27.340
Yeah, honey, you're big
news around here.

00:08:27.382 --> 00:08:28.717
They said a new
Player transferred in,

00:08:28.758 --> 00:08:29.551
and she's a looker!

00:08:29.592 --> 00:08:30.468
Is that so?

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:33.096
Don't be shy, come on in!

00:08:33.138 --> 00:08:35.098
Now. What brings you out here?

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:37.017
Weird place for
a pretty girl like you.

00:08:37.058 --> 00:08:39.269
I'm looking for
information about this.

00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:41.229
She got her a can

Hell yeah I do!

00:08:49.696 --> 00:08:51.573
Do you two know where
I could get some more?

00:08:51.614 --> 00:08:53.450
Hell, you looked like
a sweet young thing,

00:08:53.491 --> 00:08:55.660
but you don't come off
that sweet no more.

00:08:55.702 --> 00:08:58.038
Too bad. 'Cause right now...

00:08:58.079 --> 00:09:00.415
...you're talkin' to

even imagined a view like this!

Ta‐da!

00:09:45.168 --> 00:09:46.294
[ECHO]
Is that...

00:09:46.336 --> 00:09:49.547
[NIR] Yep. Jimi, the unlisted
legend of the Player world.

00:09:49.589 --> 00:09:52.008
And this is like
an uber‐rare shot.

00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:55.428
It might be the most
important treasure I have.

00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:59.099
'Cause see, I was alone
for a long time.

00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:01.935
My parents passed away
when I was still little,

00:10:01.976 --> 00:10:05.355
and I didn't have any relatives
who could take care of me.

00:10:05.396 --> 00:10:08.233
So I kinda hated the
world most of my life.

00:10:08.274 --> 00:10:09.943
It felt like I'd be
all alone till I died

00:10:09.984 --> 00:10:12.237
and there was
nothing I could do.

00:10:12.278 --> 00:10:16.282
But then I heard about
him for the first time.

00:10:16.324 --> 00:10:18.243
He tried to change the world.

00:10:18.284 --> 00:10:20.078
I thought that was so cool!

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:25.125
That's why I want to
be a Player. Are you‐‐[gasps]

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.669
[ECHO]
Thank you!

00:10:30.755 --> 00:10:33.842
[ECHO] The place I came from,
this town called Liverchester.

00:10:33.883 --> 00:10:35.218
Liverchester?

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.345
It barely even counts
as a real town.

00:10:37.387 --> 00:10:39.013
It's a junkyard.

00:10:39.055 --> 00:10:40.181
And I always thought

00:10:40.223 --> 00:10:42.559
I'd die digging through
the mountains of trash.

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:45.186
But still. I saw this man
once when I was little

00:10:45.228 --> 00:10:47.480
and I could never forget him.

00:10:47.522 --> 00:10:49.524
Nir. Let's do this!

00:10:49.566 --> 00:10:50.358
Do what?

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:51.359
Let's be friends!

00:10:51.401 --> 00:10:53.027
Seriously?

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:57.240
Jeez. That was exhausting.

00:10:57.282 --> 00:10:59.117
Princess. You're back.

00:10:59.159 --> 00:11:00.243
So, what did you learn?

00:11:00.285 --> 00:11:03.288
That there are people who
like to do math for fun.

00:11:03.329 --> 00:11:05.123
What's with you
ditching me like that?

00:11:05.165 --> 00:11:07.709
I just needed a flower
for the princess.

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:11.171
[MU] Come on. We've still got
a lot of places left to look.

00:11:19.304 --> 00:11:20.847
[MU]
See ya!

00:11:23.141 --> 00:11:25.101
[FRANCIS]
Teen Spirit, huh?

00:11:25.143 --> 00:11:28.730
Yeah. It comes in a can
that looks like this.

00:11:28.771 --> 00:11:31.733
Well, I got no idea where the
cans could be coming from.

00:11:31.774 --> 00:11:34.527
See there? I told you he
wouldn't have anything for us.

00:11:34.569 --> 00:11:36.154
We should move on.

00:11:37.947 --> 00:11:39.490
If you wanna know
what's in the cans,

00:11:39.532 --> 00:11:40.992
I could probably
find you the recipe.

00:11:41.034 --> 00:11:42.202
Wait, like, here?

00:11:42.243 --> 00:11:45.079
Sure, why not?
The stuff's everywhere.

00:11:45.121 --> 00:11:47.707
Players all over the
world still rely on it.

00:11:47.749 --> 00:11:49.209
Whoa, that's insane!

00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:51.753
Yeah, like the guys in Londinium
don't go to the front line

00:11:51.794 --> 00:11:53.838
without loading up
on Teen Spirit.

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:57.008
It's not some big secret
how it's made or anything.

00:11:57.050 --> 00:11:58.426
On top of that,
a lot of students here

00:11:58.468 --> 00:12:00.720
lost their families in
battle with the Earless.

00:12:00.762 --> 00:12:03.139
So they picked up
the habit in the field.

00:12:03.181 --> 00:12:04.182
They got their good thing

00:12:04.224 --> 00:12:06.684
and they couldn't let it go
after they made it here.

00:12:06.726 --> 00:12:08.561
For them, it's like medicine.

00:12:08.603 --> 00:12:11.648
Teen Spirit helps fill up
the void inside their hearts.

00:12:11.689 --> 00:12:14.525
Man. That makes sense,
but it's still illegal, right?

00:12:14.567 --> 00:12:17.153
Yeah, obviously.
Keep using it long enough

00:12:17.195 --> 00:12:19.280
and it'll basically
set your brain on fire.

00:12:19.322 --> 00:12:22.533
But once you get hooked,
you need it too bad to care.

00:12:25.787 --> 00:12:27.789
Yup. Found the recipe.

00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:30.500
Now you can know more
about it than I do.

00:12:31.292 --> 00:12:32.669
[NIR]
You sure this is cool?

00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:35.588
Of course.
We're friends, aren't we?

00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:37.632
This is the first amp
I ever built.

00:12:37.674 --> 00:12:40.426
Can you believe I put it all
together out of junk parts?

00:12:40.468 --> 00:12:43.179
Wow. That's awesome!

00:12:43.221 --> 00:12:46.432
So, this goes like this,
but what does this thing do?

00:12:46.474 --> 00:12:47.850
Oh, that's the cord.

00:12:47.892 --> 00:12:49.852
It's the part you
plug into the Player.

00:12:49.894 --> 00:12:53.064
Ah, is that right?

00:12:54.023 --> 00:12:55.984
Does it go like this?

00:13:00.613 --> 00:13:02.031
So you're one of the students

00:13:02.073 --> 00:13:04.450
who lost their parents in
battle with the Earless, huh?

00:13:04.492 --> 00:13:05.285
That's right.

00:13:05.326 --> 00:13:08.371
You can tell me all about
it later, once this is done.

00:13:08.413 --> 00:13:09.998
Now, there's probably someone

00:13:10.039 --> 00:13:11.916
making Teen Spirit
here on campus.

00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:13.251
But for what purpose?

00:13:13.293 --> 00:13:15.378
[MU]
Who could say? Whoever it is,

00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:18.006
they're not cooking this
stuff up in a broom closet.

00:13:18.047 --> 00:13:19.757
They have to heat it
to a high temperature

00:13:19.799 --> 00:13:21.884
and then cool it down.

00:13:21.926 --> 00:13:23.761
[BOTH gasp]

00:13:25.638 --> 00:13:30.101
[ECHO]
Whoa. What is that?

00:13:34.856 --> 00:13:36.607
[STUDENTS gasping]

00:13:36.649 --> 00:13:38.568
[NIR] Come on, why's it
always gotta be so hard

00:13:38.609 --> 00:13:41.446
to make things work right
on the first try?

00:13:53.541 --> 00:13:57.920
[NIR] I'm so happy,
'cause today I found my friend.

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:13.186
Nir! Listen to me!

00:14:13.227 --> 00:14:15.188
Please come down!

00:14:15.229 --> 00:14:19.817
[NIR]
I'm so lonely, but that's okay.

00:14:19.859 --> 00:14:23.863
[STUDENTS gasping]

00:14:23.905 --> 00:14:25.156
Why'd you bring that thing?

00:14:25.198 --> 00:14:28.826
It's student council history.
I have to protect it!

00:14:30.453 --> 00:14:32.413
[MU]
What did you do this time, Echo?

00:14:32.455 --> 00:14:34.874
Nir just hijacked my amp!

00:14:34.916 --> 00:14:36.751
[NIR] I could rip my
busted head off my shoulders

00:14:36.793 --> 00:14:38.961
and be done with all this.

00:14:39.003 --> 00:14:42.131
I can put an end to the fear
and misery right here!

00:14:51.391 --> 00:14:53.643
That's it? What happened?

00:14:53.684 --> 00:14:56.104
Was that all I could do?

00:14:57.146 --> 00:14:58.981
Hey, Nir!

00:14:59.023 --> 00:15:02.193
I was hoping your amp might
make the hurting stop

00:15:02.235 --> 00:15:03.986
for a little while
if I plugged in.

00:15:04.028 --> 00:15:05.446
You okay?

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:20.253
[gasps]

00:15:30.888 --> 00:15:33.224
I'm so sick of it all.

00:15:35.184 --> 00:15:37.103
I must have
dropped it somewhere.

00:15:37.145 --> 00:15:40.231
Ugh. Friggin' sucks.

00:15:40.273 --> 00:15:42.275
[MU] I knew this is
where I would find you.

00:15:42.316 --> 00:15:43.526
[ECHO]
Nir!

00:15:45.194 --> 00:15:47.572
I figured it out
once I saw this.

00:15:47.613 --> 00:15:48.990
You had to find
somewhere to cool off

00:15:49.031 --> 00:15:51.159
all that uncut Teen Spirit.

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:52.618
A place where none
of the other students

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:54.579
would come looking for it.

00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:56.372
Lucky for you, there was
a closed swimming pool

00:15:56.414 --> 00:15:58.249
that was just big enough, right?

00:15:58.291 --> 00:16:00.751
[HOLE] I never expected
you to make it this far.

00:16:00.793 --> 00:16:01.961
[MU]
Hole?

00:16:02.003 --> 00:16:05.465
[gasps] Nir, were you the one
making the Teen Spirit?

00:16:05.506 --> 00:16:06.883
Don't you understand?

00:16:06.924 --> 00:16:10.011
This drug does far more
than take the pain away.

00:16:11.387 --> 00:16:14.223
That's right.
It turns you into a god.

00:16:14.265 --> 00:16:17.727
It grants you the power to fight
back against this sick world.

00:16:17.768 --> 00:16:21.772
Our world is cruel,
especially to people like us.

00:16:21.814 --> 00:16:23.691
Once we graduate from here,

00:16:23.733 --> 00:16:26.736
they send us straight onto
the battlefield as Players.

00:16:26.777 --> 00:16:31.449
And then, we fight until we
break down and die all alone.

00:16:31.491 --> 00:16:33.367
And it's not right.

00:16:34.243 --> 00:16:36.662
That's why we have to
tear it all down.

00:16:36.704 --> 00:16:39.499
The same way Jimi
did it before us.

00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:43.544
You are a genius, Nir.
The greatest talent of our time.

00:16:43.586 --> 00:16:44.754
Since Jimi disappeared,

00:16:44.795 --> 00:16:47.715
there's been nobody better
at piloting Equipment.

00:16:47.757 --> 00:16:49.342
You have the power.

00:16:49.383 --> 00:16:51.385
And I've got Teen Spirit.

00:16:51.427 --> 00:16:55.681
So come with me.
And we'll rip this world apart.

00:16:58.017 --> 00:17:00.520
[HOLE]
We'll smash it to pieces.

00:17:10.071 --> 00:17:11.364
Please don't, Nir!

00:17:11.405 --> 00:17:12.907
Why would you go
along with this?

00:17:12.949 --> 00:17:15.326
Go along? You're a fool.

00:17:15.368 --> 00:17:17.495
We both want to see
this world end.

00:17:17.537 --> 00:17:21.207
It's time for us to finish
what Jimi started!

00:17:21.249 --> 00:17:22.959
We're doing this!

00:17:22.959 --> 00:17:24.794
‐‐No!
‐‐What?

00:17:27.922 --> 00:17:30.258
Are you kidding me?

00:17:30.299 --> 00:17:31.551
Wait!

00:17:32.426 --> 00:17:34.262
Hey, step back a sec.

00:17:39.016 --> 00:17:40.476
[MU groans]

00:17:40.518 --> 00:17:45.064
[NIR] We'll load up on guns
and bring all our friends.

00:17:45.106 --> 00:17:46.566
Lose it all.

00:17:46.607 --> 00:17:48.985
It's fun to pretend!

00:17:56.075 --> 00:17:57.827
Hey, kid! What's your deal?

00:17:57.868 --> 00:17:59.620
[NIR]
The sun is gone,

00:17:59.662 --> 00:18:02.498
but with the light out
it's less dangerous.

00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:03.958
Here we are now.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.710
We can share our endorphins.

00:18:05.751 --> 00:18:08.379
Entertain Us!

00:18:11.173 --> 00:18:13.968
That's it. I have to stop this!

00:18:16.178 --> 00:18:19.307
[ECHO] If I jumped onto
the AC30 from up there.

00:18:26.856 --> 00:18:28.190
That's really far.

00:18:28.232 --> 00:18:30.651
[HOLE]
Go ahead and step off.

00:18:32.361 --> 00:18:34.447
Heaven is waiting for you.

00:18:34.488 --> 00:18:36.574
How can you let Nir
suffer like this?

00:18:36.616 --> 00:18:37.950
I thought you were friends!

00:18:37.992 --> 00:18:40.786
Did you really? What a joke.

00:18:40.828 --> 00:18:42.747
Nir is just part of my plan,

00:18:42.788 --> 00:18:46.500
a bargaining chip to
get me out of this shithole.

00:18:46.542 --> 00:18:47.668
Your plan?

00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:49.086
[HOLE]
All the students here.

00:18:49.128 --> 00:18:51.589
What do you think happens
when we graduate?

00:18:51.631 --> 00:18:53.883
Easy. They ship us
off to fight the Earless

00:18:53.924 --> 00:18:56.135
until we're crippled or dead.

00:18:56.177 --> 00:18:58.804
But Nir is something special.

00:18:58.846 --> 00:19:01.265
A stronger weapon
than any military has.

00:19:01.307 --> 00:19:03.309
One they would buy at any price.

00:19:03.351 --> 00:19:07.396
In fact. They might even hand
over the entire Londinium army.

00:19:07.438 --> 00:19:10.483
The pieces are already
in place to make it happen.

00:19:10.524 --> 00:19:13.069
They all smell Teen Spirit
and they come running.

00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:14.987
Players in every country
need their fix.

00:19:15.029 --> 00:19:17.239
And my product is some
of the best there is.

00:19:17.281 --> 00:19:18.240
[ECHO]
That's horrible.

00:19:18.282 --> 00:19:20.076
I have to win this
game if I wanna live,

00:19:20.117 --> 00:19:21.619
and Nir is my trump card!

00:19:21.661 --> 00:19:23.120
[ECHO]
You've got it all wrong.

00:19:23.162 --> 00:19:24.955
Nir's a person,
not a playing card!

00:19:24.997 --> 00:19:26.749
It's not a game!

00:19:31.837 --> 00:19:33.255
Drop dead!

00:19:38.469 --> 00:19:41.097
[ECHO gasps]

00:19:43.349 --> 00:19:44.684
Hey, let go!

00:19:44.725 --> 00:19:46.936
I won't. Nir is my friend!

00:19:46.977 --> 00:19:48.312
[gasps]

00:19:50.523 --> 00:19:53.275
[BOTH gasp]

00:19:54.610 --> 00:19:55.903
[ECHO]
Nir?

00:20:05.246 --> 00:20:07.832
Whoa, that was a close one.

00:20:09.959 --> 00:20:12.920
‐‐Ow. Ow, ow, ow.
‐‐[ECHO] Mu, are you okay?

00:20:12.962 --> 00:20:15.047
For real, dude?
What part of that was okay?

00:20:15.089 --> 00:20:19.135
Uh. Sorry, but I'm trying
to be the friend Nir needs.

00:20:19.176 --> 00:20:21.929
I don't wanna fight
my friends. I can't.

00:20:21.971 --> 00:20:25.558
[NIR] For real, Echo.
You fight dirty.

00:20:25.599 --> 00:20:26.434
[ECHO]
Nir.

00:20:26.475 --> 00:20:30.855
So uh, what exactly is going on
between you and this girl?

00:20:30.896 --> 00:20:34.066
And you. What is Echo to you?

00:20:34.108 --> 00:20:38.112
A friend? Partner
in battle? Or a lover?

00:20:38.154 --> 00:20:39.238
Huh?

00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:41.991
Now I've turned my back on Hole.

00:20:42.032 --> 00:20:43.784
But honestly, we were just

00:20:43.826 --> 00:20:45.828
feeding on each
other to begin with.

00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:48.205
We started to think
that was a real connection.

00:20:48.247 --> 00:20:49.165
Hold on.

00:20:49.206 --> 00:20:51.125
[NIR]
You understand, don't you.

00:20:51.167 --> 00:20:53.252
The way the power
feels in your hands.

00:20:53.294 --> 00:20:54.920
The thrill of the fight.

00:20:54.962 --> 00:20:57.548
What'll you do when that
power swallows you up?

00:20:57.590 --> 00:21:00.092
I'm not gonna let that happen.

00:21:00.134 --> 00:21:01.552
Okay.

00:21:06.891 --> 00:21:09.977
I guess I can't
stick around anymore.

00:21:10.019 --> 00:21:11.020
Please, wait!

00:21:11.061 --> 00:21:13.397
Listen up, 'cause you both
need to hear this.

00:21:13.439 --> 00:21:16.442
At the end of the day, being a
Player means losing your mind.

00:21:16.484 --> 00:21:18.527
That's just how it is.

00:21:21.447 --> 00:21:22.740
[NIR]
Later.

00:21:27.828 --> 00:21:29.997
Don't go!

00:21:30.039 --> 00:21:31.707
[NIR]
When my time comes.

00:21:31.749 --> 00:21:34.794
Once I've finally gone
all the way crazy.

00:21:34.835 --> 00:21:36.796
Will you feel the same?

00:21:36.837 --> 00:21:39.215
Will you still
call me your friend?

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:45.763
[sirens blaring]

00:21:45.805 --> 00:21:47.932
Oh, thank you.
You saved us.

00:21:47.973 --> 00:21:49.600
I'm so grateful!

00:21:49.642 --> 00:21:50.976
But who could have imagined

00:21:51.018 --> 00:21:53.604
Hole was running
the entire operation?

00:21:53.646 --> 00:21:55.856
And right here
on campus, at that!

00:21:55.898 --> 00:21:58.442
Now, here's the file,
as we agreed to.

00:21:58.484 --> 00:22:00.236
Though honestly,
I can't guarantee

00:22:00.277 --> 00:22:03.113
you'll find anything
useful inside.

00:22:04.365 --> 00:22:05.491
Is this...

00:22:05.533 --> 00:22:08.452
[KIM] Ah, yes, that's the ruler
of the Purple Kingdom.

00:22:08.494 --> 00:22:11.664
The man known as the
Scion of Chills. Denka.

00:22:11.705 --> 00:22:12.498
Denka?

00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:13.958
After Jimi left here,

00:22:13.999 --> 00:22:16.669
I'm told Denka was the
first one he went to see.

00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:18.712
If you meet him, there's
a chance he could have

00:22:18.754 --> 00:22:21.799
quite a bit to share
with you about Jimi.

00:22:21.841 --> 00:22:23.759
Guess we know where
we gotta go next.

00:22:23.801 --> 00:22:25.135
Yeah.

00:22:26.303 --> 00:22:28.013
[MU] So like, I didn't
wanna ask you this

00:22:28.055 --> 00:22:29.181
straight up, but...

00:22:29.223 --> 00:22:30.266
[ECHO]
Shoot.

00:22:30.307 --> 00:22:32.560
‐‐[MU] Don't get offended.
‐‐[ECHO] Huh?

00:22:32.601 --> 00:22:34.728
[MU] Were you hanging out
with Nir that whole time

00:22:34.770 --> 00:22:37.606
and never realized
she was a girl?

00:22:38.941 --> 00:22:40.734
[ECHO]
Wait, for real?!

00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:14.119
[JIMI] A street corner
drenched in purple rain.

00:24:14.161 --> 00:24:16.080
Let me reveal my little secret

00:24:16.121 --> 00:24:18.916
and we can begin
our private revolution.

00:24:18.958 --> 00:24:20.542
For the time has come.

00:24:20.584 --> 00:24:22.503
Everyone reaches a hand out.

00:24:22.544 --> 00:24:24.922
Let's wing our way
towards something new.

00:24:24.964 --> 00:24:28.258
With that prayer,
our world will change.

00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:31.470
Let me guide you
to the purple rain.

00:24:31.512 --> 00:24:35.849
Mm. I can feel love
in your radiance.

00:24:35.891 --> 00:24:37.643
"In the Embrace of the Beat."

00:24:37.685 --> 00:24:40.813
Now, dance. If you are a Player.
