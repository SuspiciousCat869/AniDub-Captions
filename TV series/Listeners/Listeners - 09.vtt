WEBVTT

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:12.179
[BILIN] Sorry I'm late.
Someone tell me what's going on.

00:00:19.561 --> 00:00:21.188
The hell?

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.983
[MCGEE] My town.
Liverchester is on fire!

00:00:25.025 --> 00:00:27.653
[KEVIN sighs]
It's just as Jimi said.

00:00:27.694 --> 00:00:31.073
In the end, we all burn
the things we love.

00:00:31.114 --> 00:00:32.950
You've finally arrived.
Your Majesty.

00:00:32.991 --> 00:00:36.453
You're all dirty rats!
You knew this was gonna happen!

00:00:36.495 --> 00:00:38.455
[KEVIN]
We knew there was a price.

00:00:38.497 --> 00:00:40.541
One that our country
will pay as well.

00:00:40.582 --> 00:00:42.668
[ACE]
This land and that Player.

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:46.838
These will be the cost of our
final victory over the Earless.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.175
[TOMMY]
This is it. Project Freedom.

00:00:50.217 --> 00:00:52.844
The killing blow
against the Earless.

00:00:52.886 --> 00:00:54.263
And there he is.

00:00:54.304 --> 00:00:56.139
Jimi Stonefree.

00:00:57.474 --> 00:01:00.102
[JIMI]
Well, hello, humans.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.444
[BILIN]
This wasn't in the plan, Jimi!

00:01:09.486 --> 00:01:11.947
[JIMI] The plan now is to find
out if I can shake awake

00:01:11.989 --> 00:01:14.199
a little something
inside you all.

00:01:15.325 --> 00:01:16.493
What are you doing?

00:01:16.535 --> 00:01:19.580
[JIMI] See. There's a lot
of people running around

00:01:19.621 --> 00:01:21.665
not realizing they're asleep.

00:01:23.083 --> 00:01:25.252
[JIMI humming]

00:01:25.294 --> 00:01:27.004
[BILIN]
Jimi!

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.263
[TOMMY] I once heard it said,
by a certain man,

00:01:36.305 --> 00:01:39.349
that all you need is love.

00:01:39.391 --> 00:01:41.476
And to that, I say,

00:01:41.518 --> 00:01:45.022
if love is all we need,
then let it rule over all.

00:01:48.317 --> 00:01:51.445
[RESIDENT 9A] It's him.
Jimi's come back to us!

00:01:53.905 --> 00:01:55.824
Mu.

00:01:55.866 --> 00:01:57.451
Freedom.

00:03:31.378 --> 00:03:33.755
[MU]
So I can give.

00:03:36.174 --> 00:03:38.176
[TOMMY]
This place truly is something.

00:03:38.218 --> 00:03:39.886
Don't you think?

00:03:39.928 --> 00:03:43.014
[SALLY] I do. So, the final
battle will happen here

00:03:43.056 --> 00:03:44.766
on Brighton Beach,
is that right?

00:03:44.808 --> 00:03:50.355
Look, Sally. There.
I am the sea. In all the world.

00:03:50.397 --> 00:03:51.565
What better place could there be

00:03:51.606 --> 00:03:54.067
for everyone to witness
the final show?

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:56.445
Yes, the Player
of the Duel Showman

00:03:56.486 --> 00:03:58.196
will at last be reawakened,

00:03:58.238 --> 00:04:01.283
and the souls of everyone
living will be saved.

00:04:01.324 --> 00:04:05.287
[TOMMY] Let us begin.
Project Freedom will succeed.

00:04:05.328 --> 00:04:07.914
This will kick off
the Londinium Invasion.

00:04:09.291 --> 00:04:11.042
[TOMMY]
The Second Coming.

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:13.920
[GIRL 8C]
The adults never managed

00:04:13.962 --> 00:04:15.839
to learn from their mistakes.

00:04:15.881 --> 00:04:18.216
When they failed to
drive away the Earless,

00:04:18.258 --> 00:04:19.801
they simply complained.

00:04:19.843 --> 00:04:22.053
But now, our time's
come at last.

00:04:22.095 --> 00:04:24.806
You see these amps?
I don't recognize any of 'em.

00:04:24.848 --> 00:04:26.266
[RESIDENT 9B]
They're not Council Unit.

00:04:26.308 --> 00:04:28.518
[RESIDENT 9C]
Nah. Those're Anorak folks.

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.854
[RESIDENT 9B] And that guy
there's a Psychobilly.

00:04:30.896 --> 00:04:32.606
[RESIDENT 9C] Seems all
kinds of Players heard about

00:04:32.647 --> 00:04:35.192
the Duel Showman's revival
and came running here.

00:04:35.233 --> 00:04:37.861
[ECHO] That was a few
days ago. Out of nowhere,

00:04:37.903 --> 00:04:41.406
Players from across the world
converged on the city.

00:04:41.448 --> 00:04:43.158
It was an incredible lineup.

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.951
Londinium was glowing
with excitement

00:04:44.993 --> 00:04:47.996
as the Council prepared
for the Countdown event.

00:04:49.873 --> 00:04:50.916
[ECHO]
But...

00:04:52.125 --> 00:04:53.710
You dropped this.

00:04:55.962 --> 00:04:56.838
Thank you.

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.841
You're a Player fan, right?
Where'd you come from?

00:04:59.883 --> 00:05:00.842
Liverchester.

00:05:00.884 --> 00:05:02.803
Really? It's amazing
you made it here

00:05:02.844 --> 00:05:04.221
from out in the sticks!

00:05:04.262 --> 00:05:06.473
I understand. There's
Players and Equipment

00:05:06.515 --> 00:05:08.475
gathering here from
all over the world.

00:05:08.517 --> 00:05:10.352
It's a once‐in‐
a‐lifetime chance!

00:05:10.393 --> 00:05:12.979
Someday, I'm gonna
be just like Jimi,

00:05:13.021 --> 00:05:15.273
piloting an Equipment
and fighting the Earless!

00:05:15.315 --> 00:05:17.275
Uh‐‐ Hey, is that an amp?

00:05:17.317 --> 00:05:18.527
Lemme see!

00:05:18.568 --> 00:05:21.071
Could that mean you're
a Player yourself?

00:05:21.112 --> 00:05:25.242
[ECHO] I'm not, and the
amp is broken. Sorry.

00:05:26.493 --> 00:05:29.120
What's his deal? Lame.

00:05:29.162 --> 00:05:32.457
[ECHO] This thing.
It's stopped shining.

00:05:33.625 --> 00:05:35.585
[ACE]
Seems another year's gone by.

00:05:35.627 --> 00:05:37.504
[TOMMY]
Indeed, Field Marshal.

00:05:37.546 --> 00:05:39.464
And in the coming year,
we will see the door

00:05:39.506 --> 00:05:42.175
to a new world
thrown open before us.

00:05:42.217 --> 00:05:43.385
[ACE]
At Brighton Beach?

00:05:43.426 --> 00:05:47.097
[TOMMY] A worthy venue for
the occasion. It's all set.

00:05:47.138 --> 00:05:49.432
The Council Unit will
announce it tonight.

00:05:49.474 --> 00:05:51.893
[ACE] I can't help feeling
you've rushed things.

00:05:51.935 --> 00:05:55.355
The Duel Showman has reawakened
after ten long years.

00:05:55.397 --> 00:05:59.150
There can be no excuse to let
this opportunity pass us by.

00:05:59.192 --> 00:06:02.112
[ACE] Even if she's Jimi
Stonefree's younger sister,

00:06:02.153 --> 00:06:04.489
can we really trust that girl?

00:06:04.531 --> 00:06:07.450
[TOMMY] The awakening
is proof enough in itself.

00:06:07.492 --> 00:06:10.328
Is that not precisely
where the danger lies?

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:12.831
Much like ten years ago,
in the end,

00:06:12.873 --> 00:06:15.250
she could betray us, mankind!

00:06:15.292 --> 00:06:16.668
Just as Jimi did.

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:18.044
You've gotten old.

00:06:18.086 --> 00:06:19.004
Pardon?

00:06:19.045 --> 00:06:22.424
[TOMMY] Nothing. You're seeing
love reign over all.

00:06:22.465 --> 00:06:24.676
My generation
didn't have a future,

00:06:24.718 --> 00:06:26.803
but now they've
found love and hope.

00:06:26.845 --> 00:06:29.556
You can see that,
Field Marshal. Surely.

00:06:33.351 --> 00:06:34.728
[JIMI]
This takes me back.

00:06:34.769 --> 00:06:38.607
[MU] I don't get it.
I don't get anything.

00:06:38.648 --> 00:06:39.983
When I met you,

00:06:40.025 --> 00:06:43.194
I thought all my questions
were gonna be answered.

00:06:43.236 --> 00:06:46.531
But now, it's like
I know even less.

00:06:46.573 --> 00:06:49.868
Back then, I was living
in a room full of mirrors.

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:52.537
And me? Was I with you?

00:06:52.579 --> 00:06:54.789
And the only thing
I could see was me.

00:06:54.831 --> 00:06:58.084
So I guess that means
I wasn't there.

00:06:58.126 --> 00:07:01.463
In the end, I took my spirit
and smashed the mirrors,

00:07:01.504 --> 00:07:03.965
and the whole world was
there for me to see.

00:07:04.007 --> 00:07:05.592
The whole world.

00:07:07.093 --> 00:07:09.763
[EIN] The element of Dada
has fully awakened.

00:07:09.804 --> 00:07:12.474
I'm grateful for the
vital work you've done.

00:07:12.515 --> 00:07:14.017
This revolution
will be one worthy

00:07:14.059 --> 00:07:16.519
of our generation,
thanks to you.

00:07:16.561 --> 00:07:19.773
[EIN] Dada has no need of such
things as objective meaning.

00:07:19.814 --> 00:07:22.484
I suppose that's fair,
considering that as of now,

00:07:22.525 --> 00:07:24.653
we no longer have
a need of you either.

00:07:24.694 --> 00:07:26.363
‐‐[STUR] What?
‐‐[ZENDE] Say what?

00:07:26.404 --> 00:07:27.572
[EIN]
What exactly are you saying?

00:07:27.614 --> 00:07:29.366
[TOMMY] Your work here
is done. You're dismissed.

00:07:29.407 --> 00:07:31.409
‐‐[STUR] How rude!
‐‐[ZENDE] How insulting!

00:07:31.451 --> 00:07:33.328
I'm not much for pleasantries.

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:36.539
[EIN] Tommy. One last
request, if I may.

00:07:36.581 --> 00:07:37.540
[TOMMY]
Hm?

00:07:37.582 --> 00:07:41.294
[EIN] This chaos.
It corrodes the self.

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:46.132
[TOMMY] Here‐‐is where we
shall announce our new plan.

00:07:46.174 --> 00:07:49.594
After ten years,
the time has finally come.

00:07:49.636 --> 00:07:54.307
Once again, we shall
enact Project Freedom!

00:07:54.349 --> 00:07:58.228
A new year approaches,
and with it, a new beginning!

00:07:58.269 --> 00:07:59.479
In the name of love,

00:07:59.521 --> 00:08:02.691
humankind will rise
up once more!

00:08:02.732 --> 00:08:06.945
We'll find our freedom
in this Second Coming!

00:08:06.987 --> 00:08:13.284
[CROWD] Second Coming! Second
Coming! Second Coming!

00:08:13.326 --> 00:08:15.120
[GIRL 8C]
We're in the Lost Decade.

00:08:15.161 --> 00:08:17.122
That's what the
adults call this age.

00:08:17.163 --> 00:08:19.666
The broken world
they made for us.

00:08:19.708 --> 00:08:23.128
We've grown up living under
the specter of the Earless.

00:08:23.169 --> 00:08:26.006
But now, our generation
must fight!

00:08:26.047 --> 00:08:28.299
March with Tommy Walker!

00:08:28.341 --> 00:08:31.302
The time is now!
Second Coming!

00:08:31.344 --> 00:08:32.929
All this snow.

00:08:32.971 --> 00:08:34.389
Friggin' sucks.

00:08:38.685 --> 00:08:41.604
Nir? That's you, right?

00:08:41.646 --> 00:08:43.565
What does it matter now?

00:08:43.606 --> 00:08:45.734
Uh‐‐ Wait up!

00:08:48.903 --> 00:08:52.615
[ECHO] Hey, um.
Whose graves were those?

00:08:52.657 --> 00:08:55.452
[NIR] I'd been wondering
for a long time.

00:08:55.493 --> 00:08:58.997
I would always ask myself where
you ended up after I left.

00:08:59.039 --> 00:08:59.831
Huh?

00:08:59.873 --> 00:09:04.085
But now, you're standing
right there. It's all wrong.

00:09:04.127 --> 00:09:05.503
Wrong how?

00:09:05.545 --> 00:09:09.799
[NIR] When I came here,
I didn't want it to be with you.

00:09:11.426 --> 00:09:14.262
[NIR] Mu is really
Jimi's younger sister?

00:09:14.304 --> 00:09:16.097
[ECHO]
I couldn't believe it, either,

00:09:16.139 --> 00:09:19.225
but I can't deny everything
that's happened.

00:09:19.267 --> 00:09:20.769
That makes sense.

00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:22.645
I saw it, too.

00:09:22.687 --> 00:09:24.397
On Christmas night.

00:09:24.439 --> 00:09:26.274
She was on that Equipment.

00:09:26.316 --> 00:09:28.026
I still don't understand.

00:09:28.068 --> 00:09:30.153
How did it end up like this?

00:09:30.195 --> 00:09:34.032
Once we met Jimi,
our journey would be all over.

00:09:34.074 --> 00:09:35.241
And then...

00:09:35.283 --> 00:09:37.660
Mu would... She would...

00:09:37.702 --> 00:09:40.497
I was pulling hard for you guys.

00:09:40.538 --> 00:09:43.458
Really. When I
first met you two,

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:45.168
I believed in you.

00:09:47.378 --> 00:09:50.173
[NIR] And I guess...
You both got your wish,

00:09:50.215 --> 00:09:52.842
but you didn't get
a happy ending out of it.

00:09:52.884 --> 00:09:55.386
In the end,
Jimi was an Earless.

00:09:55.428 --> 00:09:58.264
And Mu's his sister. Understand?

00:09:58.306 --> 00:09:59.224
But Mu's not‐‐

00:09:59.265 --> 00:10:00.892
[NIR]
You've seen it yourself.

00:10:00.934 --> 00:10:03.019
You know what those
monsters are capable of.

00:10:03.061 --> 00:10:04.395
Just like I've...

00:10:04.437 --> 00:10:07.315
Ever since they
killed my family!

00:10:07.357 --> 00:10:09.359
Remember what I said?

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:12.445
Being a Player means
losing your mind.

00:10:12.487 --> 00:10:15.240
And Mu has to die.

00:10:15.281 --> 00:10:19.494
[ECHO]
Nir, please. You can't do this.

00:10:19.536 --> 00:10:21.204
[NIR]
I have no choice.

00:10:21.246 --> 00:10:23.957
You can't do it,
Echo, but I can.

00:10:23.998 --> 00:10:26.251
Because that's
what a Player does.

00:10:28.002 --> 00:10:29.546
‐‐[NIR] Piss off.
‐‐[ECHO] No.

00:10:29.587 --> 00:10:31.464
‐‐[NIR] You're just gonna‐‐
‐‐[ECHO] Get in the way?

00:10:31.506 --> 00:10:34.926
[ECHO] Exactly. I won't
let you two fight.

00:10:34.968 --> 00:10:37.387
[NIR] You're fulla crap.
You gonna stop us?

00:10:37.428 --> 00:10:38.805
Like hell!

00:10:38.847 --> 00:10:40.056
[ECHO]
Once you reach the tower,

00:10:40.098 --> 00:10:42.016
do you have any
idea where to go?

00:10:42.058 --> 00:10:43.935
[NIR]
No, what about it?

00:10:43.977 --> 00:10:46.437
I spent a whole week
living up in the Watchtower.

00:10:46.479 --> 00:10:47.981
I can be your guide.

00:10:48.022 --> 00:10:49.315
Do what you want.

00:10:50.525 --> 00:10:52.026
[ECHO]
That's what I'm doing.

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:56.114
[ECHO sighs]
Lucky us.

00:10:56.156 --> 00:10:58.283
Security's light here 'cause
they're all at the rally.

00:10:58.324 --> 00:10:59.117
[NIR]
Which way?

00:10:59.159 --> 00:11:02.912
[ECHO] Uh, lemme think
a sec. This way.

00:11:02.954 --> 00:11:04.205
Uh...

00:11:05.165 --> 00:11:07.792
'Kay. Where to now?

00:11:07.834 --> 00:11:10.837
I think we're headed in
the general direction.

00:11:10.879 --> 00:11:12.422
You're doing this
on purpose, right?

00:11:12.463 --> 00:11:14.591
[MAN 9A] Where are we
taking this stuff anyway?

00:11:14.632 --> 00:11:18.094
Up top. They want us to load it
into the sprinkler system.

00:11:18.136 --> 00:11:21.139
Whoa, straight Purple Haze?
And loads of it.

00:11:21.181 --> 00:11:22.599
This is gonna blow some minds.

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:24.350
That's what the
party's all about.

00:11:24.392 --> 00:11:26.895
Now move it, we're gonna
miss the New Year.

00:11:29.689 --> 00:11:30.815
[BOTH gasp]

00:11:35.987 --> 00:11:37.322
[NIR]
Purple Haze.

00:11:37.363 --> 00:11:40.617
It looks exactly like the Teen
Spirit we had at the academy.

00:11:40.658 --> 00:11:43.953
Teen Spirit? That crap's
just a cheap knockoff.

00:11:43.995 --> 00:11:44.996
[ECHO]
Mister Marshall!

00:11:45.038 --> 00:11:47.832
Hey, kid. Why would
you come back?

00:11:47.874 --> 00:11:50.335
I'm guessing you're not
here to raid the stash.

00:11:50.376 --> 00:11:51.211
You know him?

00:11:51.252 --> 00:11:54.422
[MARSHALL] Hm? Interesting
little amp ya have there.

00:11:54.464 --> 00:11:55.840
Hands off, creep!

00:11:55.882 --> 00:11:58.009
Help us out. Where is Mu?

00:11:58.051 --> 00:12:01.471
[MARSHALL] So that's why.
Still green, good to know.

00:12:01.512 --> 00:12:02.305
[ECHO]
Huh?

00:12:02.347 --> 00:12:04.474
[MARSHALL]
Hurry up. Follow me.

00:12:04.515 --> 00:12:06.309
[ECHO]
Thank you, Mister Marshall.

00:12:07.227 --> 00:12:10.271
[MARSHALL] Now, see,
when I said you were green...

00:12:10.313 --> 00:12:11.314
[BOTH gasp]

00:12:11.356 --> 00:12:13.399
[ECHO]
The Council Unit, and Sally!

00:12:13.441 --> 00:12:15.443
We've located Echo.

00:12:15.485 --> 00:12:17.779
And one more. A Player.

00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:19.781
Grab them.

00:12:19.822 --> 00:12:22.033
Damn old bastard. What is this?

00:12:22.075 --> 00:12:24.994
Never trust anyone
over 30, right?

00:12:25.036 --> 00:12:26.204
I'll hang on to this.

00:12:26.246 --> 00:12:28.289
Throw them in
the basement cells.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.128
[TOMMY] Now it's time
to start the second act.

00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:36.089
Commander Tommy.

00:12:36.130 --> 00:12:38.508
[TOMMY]
The boy came back?

00:12:38.549 --> 00:12:40.260
Wasn't that gallant of him.

00:12:40.301 --> 00:12:42.762
[ACE] Tommy! What is
the meaning of this?

00:12:42.804 --> 00:12:45.390
Field Marshall.
Great timing. I need to‐‐

00:12:45.431 --> 00:12:47.850
Did you intend to
dose the whole party?

00:12:47.892 --> 00:12:50.436
[TOMMY] Ahh. With the
Purple Haze, you mean?

00:12:50.478 --> 00:12:53.439
It's hardly a proper
party if we don't.

00:12:53.481 --> 00:12:55.233
You only gathered
all those people here

00:12:55.275 --> 00:12:56.985
to rob them of their will!

00:12:57.026 --> 00:13:00.280
[TOMMY] Yes, and in its place
we will leave love to rule them.

00:13:00.321 --> 00:13:02.115
To think that the one
who devised that plot

00:13:02.156 --> 00:13:04.033
is the man I'm speaking to.

00:13:04.075 --> 00:13:05.451
What is it you want?

00:13:05.493 --> 00:13:07.787
Jimi hasn't been
brought back to life.

00:13:07.829 --> 00:13:09.497
That girl is not him.

00:13:09.539 --> 00:13:11.541
[TOMMY] She is the
Duel Showman's Player.

00:13:11.582 --> 00:13:13.501
Then what the hell are you
trying to do with his amp?

00:13:13.543 --> 00:13:15.712
[TOMMY]
I'm trying to fulfill your wish.

00:13:15.753 --> 00:13:18.047
Field Marshal.
To secure the future

00:13:18.089 --> 00:13:20.967
you've been longing for
in the depths of your heart.

00:13:21.009 --> 00:13:21.801
No.

00:13:21.843 --> 00:13:25.221
[TOMMY]
Absolutely! And you know it.

00:13:25.263 --> 00:13:26.514
A world free of the Earless,

00:13:26.556 --> 00:13:28.850
with Londinium
standing at the top!

00:13:28.891 --> 00:13:32.353
That's right. Your dream,
made real at last.

00:13:32.395 --> 00:13:36.024
You're wrong. These
ten years, I've changed.

00:13:36.065 --> 00:13:37.567
I don't buy that.

00:13:38.526 --> 00:13:41.654
When the people transcend
the boundaries of the self.

00:13:41.696 --> 00:13:44.407
When they come together
into a singular consciousness.

00:13:44.449 --> 00:13:46.617
That is when we will
reach the next world,

00:13:46.659 --> 00:13:48.578
one free of the Earless.

00:13:48.619 --> 00:13:51.664
This will be the true
Londinium Invasion.

00:13:51.706 --> 00:13:55.209
Tommy. That won't
bring us freedom.

00:13:55.251 --> 00:13:57.337
How can you be free if
you give up your will,

00:13:57.378 --> 00:13:58.921
your very sense of self?

00:13:58.963 --> 00:14:01.841
[TOMMY]
What's that? My will?

00:14:01.883 --> 00:14:03.801
I never had one.

00:14:03.843 --> 00:14:05.428
[gasps]

00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:07.138
[TOMMY] The kids have
kept me well informed

00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:10.350
of the treasonous acts you've
been plotting, Field Marshal.

00:14:10.391 --> 00:14:13.603
You would train children to
carry out surveillance for you?

00:14:13.644 --> 00:14:15.772
You've been communicating
with Denka the Purple

00:14:15.813 --> 00:14:18.066
as well as the king
without a country.

00:14:18.107 --> 00:14:21.027
You're the only one here who's
given up his sense of self.

00:14:21.069 --> 00:14:23.196
Walker, you wretch.
This is madness!

00:14:23.237 --> 00:14:26.908
[TOMMY] I bear no such burden.
I'm only a mirror.

00:14:26.949 --> 00:14:29.077
Whenever somebody looks at me,

00:14:29.118 --> 00:14:32.246
it's merely their own ambition
they see gazing back.

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:38.169
Ashes to ashtrays.
Dust to dustbins.

00:14:40.171 --> 00:14:44.050
My friends. It's time
for the party.

00:14:47.303 --> 00:14:48.721
[ECHO]
Sorry. Nir.

00:14:48.763 --> 00:14:50.765
[NIR]
"Don't trust grown‐ups."

00:14:50.807 --> 00:14:52.642
Hole always told me that.

00:14:52.683 --> 00:14:56.562
Guess it didn't matter, 'cause
in the end, they used him, too.

00:14:56.604 --> 00:15:01.484
It's like no matter where
they go, Players all get used.

00:15:01.526 --> 00:15:02.318
Just like Mu‐‐

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:05.321
[NIR]
Screw her! Mu is an Earless.

00:15:05.363 --> 00:15:07.448
And that's why
I have to kill her.

00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:08.491
You can't!

00:15:08.533 --> 00:15:11.452
[JOE] It's you, right?
The kids who snuck in here?

00:15:11.494 --> 00:15:14.330
Which means, you're Nir.

00:15:14.372 --> 00:15:17.250
My name's Joe. Ritchie and
Lyde were friends of mine.

00:15:17.291 --> 00:15:18.042
[gasps]

00:15:18.084 --> 00:15:20.294
[JOE]
They told me plenty about you.

00:15:20.336 --> 00:15:22.422
Those two. Listen.

00:15:22.463 --> 00:15:25.800
Yeah, well. Best ending they
could've hoped for, really.

00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:29.053
Where did my amp go?

00:15:29.095 --> 00:15:31.764
That weaselly old man
Marshall grabbed it.

00:15:31.806 --> 00:15:34.058
[JOE]
Marshall. Yeah. I saw him.

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:36.686
Hey. Think you could
let me out, too?

00:15:36.727 --> 00:15:37.728
Not my call.

00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:39.522
He'd only try to stop me.

00:15:39.564 --> 00:15:40.648
I'll come back.

00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:43.443
After Mu is finally
taken care of.

00:15:43.484 --> 00:15:45.027
Nir. Wait! Don't go!

00:15:45.069 --> 00:15:48.114
[NIR] I gotta get my amp back.
Lead the way, Joe!

00:15:48.156 --> 00:15:49.782
[JOE]
Right! No problem!

00:15:49.824 --> 00:15:51.868
Stop, Nir! You can't do this!

00:15:51.909 --> 00:15:54.996
I am a Player. Mu!

00:15:57.206 --> 00:15:59.834
Old man! Get out here!

00:16:00.751 --> 00:16:04.964
[ECHO]
Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!

00:16:07.758 --> 00:16:10.261
What are you?

00:16:10.303 --> 00:16:11.095
Uh‐oh!

00:16:11.137 --> 00:16:13.097
[NIR yells]

00:16:13.139 --> 00:16:14.140
Giddy up!

00:16:15.558 --> 00:16:18.478
[ECHO]
I haven't got‐‐much time.

00:16:20.438 --> 00:16:21.689
All right!

00:16:24.108 --> 00:16:27.278
Gotta make it. Mu!

00:16:29.989 --> 00:16:32.658
[ECHO]
Come on. Where are you?

00:16:34.327 --> 00:16:35.328
[ECHO]
Mu!

00:16:38.247 --> 00:16:39.373
[ECHO]
Hey, Mu?

00:16:40.249 --> 00:16:43.503
[TOMMY] Honestly,
you're hopelessly earnest.

00:16:43.544 --> 00:16:47.131
And what's worse,
you're quite stupid.

00:16:47.173 --> 00:16:50.968
[ECHO gasps] What kind of plot
have you dragged Mu into?

00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:52.428
"Dragged," you say?

00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:54.180
Why, I would never.

00:16:54.222 --> 00:16:57.225
Mu elected to take advantage
of this opportunity.

00:16:57.266 --> 00:16:58.726
[ECHO]
She wouldn't do that!

00:16:58.768 --> 00:17:00.061
[TOMMY]
The girl you came here with

00:17:00.102 --> 00:17:02.396
was a facade and nothing more.

00:17:02.438 --> 00:17:05.149
This is who Mu really is inside.

00:17:05.191 --> 00:17:06.567
So that's it.

00:17:06.609 --> 00:17:09.904
She received the answers to her
questions and accepted them.

00:17:09.946 --> 00:17:12.532
The only one who hasn't‐‐is you.

00:17:13.491 --> 00:17:15.618
[TOMMY]
In the name of love and hope,

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:18.246
Mu will do for us
what Jimi couldn't.

00:17:18.287 --> 00:17:21.040
We'll carry on the war
to set humanity free,

00:17:21.082 --> 00:17:23.334
with her standing in his place.

00:17:23.376 --> 00:17:26.379
And where Jimi failed,
she will succeed.

00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:29.507
But this. This just isn't right.

00:17:29.549 --> 00:17:31.050
How do you figure?

00:17:31.092 --> 00:17:33.052
She came to meet Jimi,
did she not?

00:17:33.094 --> 00:17:36.389
And she made the choice
to take part in this plan.

00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:37.974
Now, we've reached the end.

00:17:38.015 --> 00:17:42.186
And Mu has become
Jimi himself. You see?

00:17:42.228 --> 00:17:43.771
She'll take his
place at our side

00:17:43.813 --> 00:17:46.065
in the fight with the Earless.

00:17:46.107 --> 00:17:50.319
Hm? Did I get
something wrong, friend?

00:17:50.361 --> 00:17:53.698
[ECHO] When I was back in
Liverchester, I knew nothing.

00:17:53.739 --> 00:17:56.742
About the world or the Earless.

00:17:56.784 --> 00:17:59.912
But then I met Mu,
and so many others.

00:17:59.954 --> 00:18:02.832
I've seen new places,
and I understand now.

00:18:02.873 --> 00:18:06.043
Our true enemy
is not the Earless.

00:18:08.045 --> 00:18:10.673
You've missed
the point entirely.

00:18:10.715 --> 00:18:13.926
Explain it to him. Princess.

00:18:15.553 --> 00:18:19.640
[ECHO] Mu! I have
something to tell you.

00:18:19.682 --> 00:18:21.309
Listen!

00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:22.768
[ECHO gasps]

00:18:23.686 --> 00:18:26.063
[NIR]
This isn't a friggin' tea party!

00:18:26.105 --> 00:18:27.815
Nir. You can't!

00:18:27.857 --> 00:18:28.816
[NIR]
Mu!

00:18:28.858 --> 00:18:32.820
[TOMMY] Ah. You're Hole's
puppet. How fun.

00:18:32.862 --> 00:18:34.405
Cut the crap!

00:18:37.992 --> 00:18:43.122
Down in front, amateurs.
I came here for Mu! Now die!

00:18:44.123 --> 00:18:46.417
Happy New Year!

00:18:49.211 --> 00:18:51.380
[grunting]

00:18:51.422 --> 00:18:53.674
[yells]

00:19:00.806 --> 00:19:03.351
Well. Hello, humans.

00:19:03.392 --> 00:19:05.728
[NIR]
Damn you!

00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:08.356
I'm gonna tear
you apart, Earless!

00:19:14.362 --> 00:19:15.988
So many of you around.

00:19:16.030 --> 00:19:18.991
All obsessed with the
same dead guy, to a one.

00:19:19.033 --> 00:19:20.951
It truly is a strange story.

00:19:20.993 --> 00:19:23.537
I won't stop until you die!

00:19:23.579 --> 00:19:25.373
[MU]
Pure fantasy.

00:19:26.499 --> 00:19:28.459
[JIMI]
Love doesn't lie.

00:19:28.501 --> 00:19:31.837
If there is something to be
changed in this world,

00:19:31.879 --> 00:19:34.131
then it can only
happen through love.

00:19:45.017 --> 00:19:51.065
[JIMI humming]

00:20:06.664 --> 00:20:11.460
[JIMI] And in the end,
we all burn the things we love.

00:20:15.005 --> 00:20:17.383
Now burn, as my offering.

00:20:25.474 --> 00:20:29.228
Yes. Burn them!
They're yours to sacrifice!

00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:30.396
Stop this!

00:20:30.438 --> 00:20:31.731
Mu, you were drugged.

00:20:31.772 --> 00:20:34.734
But I... I know you
can still fight it!

00:20:34.775 --> 00:20:38.571
Even if you were right,
it's far too late to stop now.

00:20:38.612 --> 00:20:40.990
It was you all along.

00:20:41.031 --> 00:20:44.034
This power is destroying
my mind all because of you!

00:20:44.076 --> 00:20:46.245
[TOMMY]
Duel Showman. Do it!

00:20:46.287 --> 00:20:47.079
[MU]
Top.

00:20:47.121 --> 00:20:49.498
No, Mu! Please!

00:20:50.833 --> 00:20:52.710
[ECHO]
You're not Jimi!

00:20:52.752 --> 00:20:54.503
I need you to hear me!

00:20:54.545 --> 00:20:57.965
Okay? Listen. Mu.

00:20:58.007 --> 00:21:01.969
[MU]
Mu? Who is that, human?

00:21:02.011 --> 00:21:03.846
No matter.

00:21:03.888 --> 00:21:07.892
Little boy. You're no Player.

00:21:07.933 --> 00:21:11.437
Over the Top. Boost.

00:21:11.479 --> 00:21:13.606
Echo. Look out!

00:21:17.943 --> 00:21:19.779
[NIR screams]

00:21:22.448 --> 00:21:25.117
[MARSHALL] Bloody hell.
Who left the scraps out?

00:21:25.159 --> 00:21:28.078
Best get 'em to
the compost heap.

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:29.288
Hup.

00:21:29.330 --> 00:21:31.582
[ECHO]
Mu!

00:21:40.132 --> 00:21:45.012
[MARSHALL]
Hey! Echo! You dead, son?

00:21:45.054 --> 00:21:46.096
Huh?

00:21:47.932 --> 00:21:49.975
[MARSHALL]
Well, that answers that.

00:21:51.602 --> 00:21:55.272
[MARSHALL] Job market in
this town just took a dive.

00:21:55.314 --> 00:21:58.234
[ECHO]
Aren't you on their side?

00:21:58.275 --> 00:22:01.362
[MARSHALL] Hm? Nah,
this was never my fight.

00:22:01.403 --> 00:22:03.531
Gimme the cash and I'll
be on your side, too.

00:22:03.572 --> 00:22:07.243
Yeah. I go where the money is
and I do what I get paid to do.

00:22:07.284 --> 00:22:09.119
Then why bother saving me?

00:22:09.161 --> 00:22:10.871
Because we're both underdogs.

00:22:10.913 --> 00:22:12.998
We'll be safer in a pack.

00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:14.333
Wanna stick together?

00:22:14.375 --> 00:22:16.919
[alarm ringing]

00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:19.463
Hurry! Hop off.

00:22:19.505 --> 00:22:21.048
C'mon, Echo!

00:22:24.844 --> 00:22:26.262
Well, good luck.

00:24:01.815 --> 00:24:05.778
[ECHO]
I knew it. From the start.

00:24:05.819 --> 00:24:08.197
There's nothing I can do.

00:24:08.238 --> 00:24:09.865
There never was.

00:24:11.909 --> 00:24:13.619
[JIMI]
We were caged in a tiny world,

00:24:13.661 --> 00:24:16.080
behind twelve bars
and five notes.

00:24:16.121 --> 00:24:18.874
So we shed our blood
in order to break free.

00:24:18.916 --> 00:24:21.627
And that's when we
discovered the real world.

00:24:21.669 --> 00:24:25.673
"Cross Road Blues." A Player
makes a deal with the devil.
