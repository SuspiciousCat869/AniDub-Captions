you're in the headquarters

of Tremolo Technologies.

00:07:51.137 --> 00:07:53.515
We follow the Noise produced
by the Earless to collect

Why did you
rescue us back there?

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:09.906
Of course.

00:08:09.948 --> 00:08:12.742
You'll need some background
before it makes sense.

00:08:15.453 --> 00:08:17.455
[BILIN] Ten years ago now,
my country agreed

00:08:17.497 --> 00:08:20.375
to host what was to be
the world's biggest Fest.

00:08:20.417 --> 00:08:23.253
A historic operation on
an unprecedented scale,

00:08:23.294 --> 00:08:25.839
with the aim of wiping out
the Earless completely.

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:27.716
Multiple nations
sponsored the event,

00:08:27.757 --> 00:08:29.801
and all the best‐known
Players from across the world

00:08:29.843 --> 00:08:31.928
united behind a common cause.

00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:34.431
Had the Fest succeeded,
our world would be free today

00:08:34.472 --> 00:08:37.851
from the plague of the Earless,
but sadly, in the end,

00:08:37.892 --> 00:08:41.104
that grand endeavor could hardly
have been more of a failure.

00:08:41.146 --> 00:08:43.273
The Earless responded
in overwhelming numbers,

00:08:43.314 --> 00:08:45.108
and they took a dreadful toll.

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:48.194
In terms of life lost
and Equipment scrapped.

00:08:48.236 --> 00:08:51.281
And having been the host and the
main drive behind that effort,

00:08:51.322 --> 00:08:53.700
my country was held liable.

00:08:53.742 --> 00:08:56.619
In the eyes of the world,
our ambition had set off a war

00:08:56.661 --> 00:08:58.747
that devastated
all of humankind,

00:08:58.788 --> 00:09:01.833
and our beloved homeland
was the price we paid for it.

00:09:01.875 --> 00:09:04.169
But why did you save me?

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:07.047
The reason we failed, was that
a single Player went rogue

00:09:07.088 --> 00:09:09.674
and compromised the entire plan.

00:09:09.716 --> 00:09:11.718
The most powerful Player
alive back then,

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:13.386
whose name you might know.

00:09:13.428 --> 00:09:15.346
It was Jimi Stonefree.

00:09:15.388 --> 00:09:18.725
And that, the Core Part

00:09:18.767 --> 00:09:21.186
is identical to the one he used.

00:09:21.227 --> 00:09:23.063
You mistook my purpose.

00:09:23.104 --> 00:09:25.690
You've been captured,
not rescued.

00:09:25.732 --> 00:09:27.150
Now, Miss Mu.

00:09:27.192 --> 00:09:29.611

Good to meet you.

It's better to burn out

Plus, when something burns out,

if you repair it,
you can still use it.

It's true, believe it or not.

00:11:11.462 --> 00:11:14.591
Right, then. I see no reason
I should assume you're lying,

00:11:14.632 --> 00:11:17.260
but I'm afraid I still
can't allow someone

00:11:17.302 --> 00:11:18.928
bearing this power to roam free.

00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:20.054
Wait a minute!

00:11:20.096 --> 00:11:22.182
It poses too great a danger.

00:11:22.223 --> 00:11:24.475
I mean. If it were
to be used improperly,

00:11:24.517 --> 00:11:28.271
it could quite literally
bring the world to an end.

00:11:28.313 --> 00:11:30.273
And in any case,
if you've got no memories,

00:11:30.315 --> 00:11:31.733
you've got nowhere to be.

00:11:31.774 --> 00:11:34.152
Hardly makes sense
to hurry there, does it?

00:11:34.194 --> 00:11:36.738
I guess you're
not exactly wrong.

00:11:36.779 --> 00:11:37.906
Kevin?

00:11:37.947 --> 00:11:39.657
[ECHO] You don't have to
plug it into the amp?

00:11:39.699 --> 00:11:40.867
You didn't realize?

00:11:40.909 --> 00:11:42.702
As long as the
Core Part responds,

00:11:42.744 --> 00:11:44.412
the Equipment will function.

00:11:44.454 --> 00:11:45.413
Who is that?

00:11:45.455 --> 00:11:46.789
He's our director,

00:11:46.831 --> 00:11:48.917
outside his room for the
first time in four years.

00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:49.751
No joke?

00:11:49.792 --> 00:11:52.212
And for an amplifier,
of all the silly things.

00:11:52.253 --> 00:11:54.380
[MU] And look at him down there
grinning like an idiot.

00:11:54.422 --> 00:11:56.382
Not a friggin' clue
what I've been dealing with.

00:11:56.424 --> 00:11:57.592
Men never seem to outgrow

00:11:57.634 --> 00:11:59.344
the urge to play
with toys, do they?

00:11:59.385 --> 00:12:00.220
Dude, right?

00:12:00.261 --> 00:12:02.388
If you love your amp so much,
why don't you marry it?

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:04.265
Like a pack of
self‐indulgent kids.

00:12:04.307 --> 00:12:06.517
Yep, though we can
be just as bad.

00:12:06.559 --> 00:12:08.436
[BILIN]
We surely can.

00:12:08.478 --> 00:12:09.896
[ZENDE]
What are you going to do?

00:12:09.938 --> 00:12:11.356
[STUR]
Where are you going to go?

00:12:11.397 --> 00:12:14.234
[EIN] How are you going to
tear this world asunder?

00:12:14.275 --> 00:12:16.653
[gasps]

00:12:16.694 --> 00:12:19.614
Excuse me. I need to
get some more rest.

00:12:19.656 --> 00:12:23.117
Of course. Feel free,
but is everything...?

00:12:36.798 --> 00:12:39.676
So you dug a Player out
of the scrap heap, did ya?

00:12:39.717 --> 00:12:41.344
Sounds like a fairy tale.

00:12:41.386 --> 00:12:43.471
Yeah, that was pretty
much what it felt like.

00:12:43.513 --> 00:12:45.556
How could she have gotten
mixed in with that stuff?

00:12:45.598 --> 00:12:47.684
But in any case,
I guess the two of you

00:12:47.725 --> 00:12:49.185
ended up becoming partners, huh?

00:12:49.227 --> 00:12:50.895
Not too sure about that.

00:12:50.937 --> 00:12:53.231
Today she told me to
go back to Liverchester.

00:12:53.273 --> 00:12:54.732
Ahh, right.

00:12:54.774 --> 00:12:57.402
Well, you're kids, that sort
of thing's to be expected.

00:12:57.443 --> 00:12:58.403
Bit of advice.

00:12:58.444 --> 00:13:00.738
With women, you have to
create the right mood.

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:02.407
After the kiss, you just‐‐

00:13:02.448 --> 00:13:04.701
Hey, it's not even like that!

00:13:05.994 --> 00:13:08.121
[ECHO]
Uh, hey, Mister Kevin?

00:13:08.162 --> 00:13:10.373
You used to be a Player
before, is that right?

00:13:10.415 --> 00:13:12.917
Huh? What's this about?

00:13:12.959 --> 00:13:14.502
[ECHO] The Crimson Belle's
entry in the almanac

00:13:14.544 --> 00:13:17.505
said you were originally
part of a two‐member crew.

00:13:17.547 --> 00:13:21.217
But now Ms. Bilin does
the piloting by herself.

00:13:21.259 --> 00:13:23.386
So, what made you give it up?

00:13:24.512 --> 00:13:27.181
You've done your homework,
haven't you, lad?

00:13:28.349 --> 00:13:31.352
As you said.
Sue is built for two.

00:13:31.394 --> 00:13:33.980
I built it so I could
pilot it with Bilin.

00:13:34.022 --> 00:13:35.481
And that was selfish.

00:13:35.523 --> 00:13:37.358
My fear got the better of me.

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:40.028
You mean you were afraid
of the Earless? I see.

00:13:40.069 --> 00:13:44.949
I was. But no, that wasn't it.

00:13:44.991 --> 00:13:46.159
Bilin's a knight.

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:49.162
She'd always serve her country,
even at the cost of her life.

00:13:49.203 --> 00:13:51.622
and that terrified me,
because I'd have readily

00:13:51.664 --> 00:13:53.708
given up our country
to save her.

00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:55.126
That's the kind of fear
that's often to blame

00:13:55.168 --> 00:13:57.211
for people splitting up.

00:13:57.253 --> 00:13:58.838
Knowing that if you
keep hanging on,

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:02.091
one of you is certain to
end up hurting the other.

00:14:02.133 --> 00:14:04.385
Right, should be good to go.

00:14:04.427 --> 00:14:06.220
Now, have you given it a name?

00:14:06.262 --> 00:14:08.056
A name? That's a thing?

00:14:08.097 --> 00:14:10.058
It's a terribly important thing.

00:14:10.099 --> 00:14:11.768
You've brought this
amp into the world,

00:14:11.809 --> 00:14:13.436
but once you've
given a name to it,

00:14:13.478 --> 00:14:15.855
that's when it
truly comes alive.

00:14:15.897 --> 00:14:21.903
[inaudible]

00:14:32.288 --> 00:14:33.998
[BILIN]
Trouble sleeping?

00:14:35.583 --> 00:14:39.087
[MU] My brain keeps finding
better things to do.

00:14:39.128 --> 00:14:41.881
Sometimes I catch the
breeze dancing around me

00:14:41.923 --> 00:14:45.176
and wonder if maybe I've
gotten lost in a fantasy.

00:14:45.218 --> 00:14:47.887
Fallen into some vision
twisted by my fear.

00:14:47.929 --> 00:14:49.806
Like a Daydream.

00:14:49.847 --> 00:14:50.890
And someday,

00:14:50.932 --> 00:14:53.684
I'll wake up in the real world
with the Earless gone,

00:14:53.726 --> 00:14:55.561
and life will go on
without all the darkness

00:14:55.603 --> 00:14:57.980
bearing down on everyone.
Would be nice.

00:14:58.022 --> 00:15:00.691
Except we are awake.

00:15:00.733 --> 00:15:03.736
Quite a frosty response.

00:15:03.778 --> 00:15:06.406
You think you'll lose him,
and it scares you.

00:15:06.447 --> 00:15:07.115
[MU gasps]

00:15:07.156 --> 00:15:09.117
I still don't know
where you came from,

00:15:09.158 --> 00:15:10.368
and it seems you don't either,

00:15:10.410 --> 00:15:12.620
which is a whole
mystery in itself.

00:15:12.662 --> 00:15:16.374
To be honest,
I can't quite trust you yet.

00:15:16.416 --> 00:15:18.251
So think of these words
as the private thoughts

00:15:18.292 --> 00:15:19.752
of a fellow Player.

00:15:19.794 --> 00:15:22.964
Thoughts that you just
happened to overhear.

00:15:23.005 --> 00:15:25.174
Sometimes when
I fight the Earless,

00:15:25.216 --> 00:15:27.593
I can hear their voices
calling out to me.

00:15:27.635 --> 00:15:31.055
Though it's not really them.
I know they're in my head.

00:15:31.097 --> 00:15:34.392
And yet, I'm sure I sense
a longing in them.

00:15:34.434 --> 00:15:35.643
Like they're begging me.

00:15:35.685 --> 00:15:38.604
"Give us more.
Rain your passion on us.

00:15:38.646 --> 00:15:43.109
Douse that ember of reason that
still burns us from the inside."

00:15:43.151 --> 00:15:44.360
And I will.

00:15:44.402 --> 00:15:47.196
I'll fight to rid this
world of the Earless.

00:15:47.238 --> 00:15:49.115
Even if the world
hates me for it.

00:15:49.157 --> 00:15:51.617
Even if it means
giving up my homeland.

00:15:51.659 --> 00:15:53.828
Tortured creatures,
phantoms lashing out,

00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:55.121
lost in their anguish.

00:15:55.163 --> 00:15:58.624
I won't rest till they're
all saved. Every one.

00:16:00.001 --> 00:16:00.835
Tell me.

00:16:00.877 --> 00:16:04.213
What's the most important
quality for a Player? Any ideas?

00:16:04.255 --> 00:16:05.089
Talent, right?

00:16:05.131 --> 00:16:06.215
Try again.

00:16:06.257 --> 00:16:07.091
Or, power?

00:16:07.133 --> 00:16:08.342
Not quite.

00:16:08.384 --> 00:16:10.052
Technique, then.

00:16:11.262 --> 00:16:14.724
Conviction. And it makes
no difference what for,

00:16:14.765 --> 00:16:18.227
as long as your desire to share
it is too strong to hold back.

00:16:18.269 --> 00:16:20.480
That conviction is what
gives off the light

00:16:20.521 --> 00:16:23.816
which guides the Earless
to their salvation.

00:16:23.858 --> 00:16:26.360
If there's something in you
that compels you to press on,

00:16:26.402 --> 00:16:28.613
even through your
fear of losing him,

00:16:28.654 --> 00:16:30.490
then perhaps that
part of yourself

00:16:30.531 --> 00:16:32.783
is where you'll find
your conviction.

00:16:39.749 --> 00:16:40.541
Ms. Bilin!

00:19:01.307 --> 00:19:03.100
Fine. This is fine!

00:19:07.855 --> 00:19:09.315
Whoa. We're flying.

00:19:09.357 --> 00:19:10.483
I whipped up a little mod

00:19:10.524 --> 00:19:12.693
while I was replacing
the rectifier tube.

00:19:12.735 --> 00:19:16.072
[MU] Hell yeah!
That's what I call a partner!

00:19:16.113 --> 00:19:18.699
Kids these days get
revved up fast, don't they?

00:19:18.741 --> 00:19:20.826
We have to show these
punks how it's done.

00:19:20.868 --> 00:19:22.745
Let's go, Young Lion!

00:19:28.292 --> 00:19:29.794
[groans]

00:19:39.345 --> 00:19:42.181
Easy there, Chelsea Girl.
Keep it steady!

00:19:43.891 --> 00:19:46.227
Hey! Was that all
the speed we've got?

00:19:46.268 --> 00:19:48.979
Well there's only one
way to find out, right?

00:19:55.403 --> 00:19:58.114
That's the idea. Think fast!

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:00.157
[ECHO]
Use the Top Boost!

00:20:00.199 --> 00:20:01.325
Pop what loose?

00:20:01.367 --> 00:20:04.203
No, Top Boost!
That's your ultimate attack.

00:20:04.245 --> 00:20:06.163
The one you used
back in Liverchester!

00:20:06.205 --> 00:20:07.456
Like the one that
stopped working?

00:20:07.498 --> 00:20:10.876
It will work!
You just focus on doing it!

00:20:18.008 --> 00:20:19.510
[MU]
I was afraid.

00:20:19.552 --> 00:20:21.303
I thought that
maybe there wasn't

00:20:21.345 --> 00:20:23.556
a place for me in this world.

00:20:23.597 --> 00:20:26.434
That even after you gave me
a reason to be here,

00:20:26.475 --> 00:20:29.812
someone else could come
along and take it away.

00:20:29.854 --> 00:20:31.105
I want...

00:20:32.356 --> 00:20:35.234
I want to be a Player!

00:20:37.319 --> 00:20:41.490
[MU, ECHO]
Top Boost!

00:20:44.535 --> 00:20:45.828
That same glow.

00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:48.247
It's true. There's no doubt.

00:20:48.289 --> 00:20:50.332
[KEVIN]
It is, and it's much brighter

00:20:50.374 --> 00:20:52.418
than it ever was in him.

00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:54.545
But you're still far too green!

00:20:54.587 --> 00:20:56.756
Let's see how you
deal with this!

00:21:01.427 --> 00:21:02.720
I Can See It!

00:21:02.762 --> 00:21:04.930
But I Can't...

00:21:04.972 --> 00:21:06.348
[BILIN, KEVIN]
...Feel It!

00:21:12.855 --> 00:21:14.023
Beautiful.

00:21:14.064 --> 00:21:15.566
So sick!

00:21:25.201 --> 00:21:27.328
That was the coolest ever!

00:21:27.369 --> 00:21:29.330
True Crimson was everything
you said it would be,

00:21:29.371 --> 00:21:30.873
I could feel it
down to my bones!

00:21:30.915 --> 00:21:33.793
Wow! Um, do you mind‐‐ Ow!

00:21:33.834 --> 00:21:34.960
All right.

00:21:35.002 --> 00:21:37.546
We gave you what you
asked for, so can we go?

00:21:37.588 --> 00:21:40.716
You may. Although,
there is a condition.

00:21:40.758 --> 00:21:43.594
Ugh. I thought we were
done with conditions.

00:21:43.636 --> 00:21:44.970
When our Fest failed,

00:21:45.012 --> 00:21:47.056
those Players who
survived split up

00:21:47.097 --> 00:21:49.683
and withdrew to
their own countries.

00:21:49.725 --> 00:21:52.561
All of them carry a bit
of Jimi's hidden legacy.

00:21:52.603 --> 00:21:55.397
They'll know things
that even I don't.

00:21:55.439 --> 00:21:57.107
Track them all down
and learn the truth

00:21:57.149 --> 00:21:58.984
behind the power within you.

00:21:59.026 --> 00:22:01.320
Because if you can't
do that, you'll always...

00:22:01.362 --> 00:22:02.655
...be a Chelsea Girl.

00:22:02.696 --> 00:22:05.115
That's what you were
gonna say, right?

00:22:08.285 --> 00:22:09.495
[MU]
Yeah, I'm down.

00:22:09.537 --> 00:22:10.996
After all the crap
he's put me through,

00:22:11.038 --> 00:22:14.124
I'm ready to go get a piece
of this Jimi guy for myself.

00:22:14.166 --> 00:22:16.544
I owe him at least
one clean shot to the jaw,

00:22:16.585 --> 00:22:17.378
don't you think?

00:22:17.419 --> 00:22:19.630
Dear me. She's a rowdy one.

00:22:19.672 --> 00:22:22.216
[MU] We'll meet again,
and I won't lose!

00:22:22.258 --> 00:22:24.343
[ECHO]
Thank you so much!

00:22:31.475 --> 00:22:32.810
Say. Bilin.

00:22:32.852 --> 00:22:33.811
Yeah?

00:22:33.853 --> 00:22:36.856
Uh. Think the world's
gonna change today?

00:22:36.897 --> 00:22:40.150
Well. Suppose we'll see.

00:24:11.867 --> 00:24:13.243
[JIMI]
Hair mussed from sleep.

00:24:13.285 --> 00:24:16.372
Lingering on the balcony in
the same shirt I slept in.

00:24:16.413 --> 00:24:18.791
I look up and I see a black sun.

00:24:18.832 --> 00:24:20.250
I shouldn't let it get to me.

00:24:20.292 --> 00:24:22.211
It's just their hearts
that are tainted.

00:24:22.252 --> 00:24:24.505
As for me, I'll put
the gun to my temple

00:24:24.546 --> 00:24:26.757
with a smile on my face.

00:24:26.799 --> 00:24:29.426
I've always disliked
having to lie to people.

00:24:29.468 --> 00:24:31.303
Better to be hated
for what you are

00:24:31.345 --> 00:24:33.472
than loved for what you're not.

00:24:33.514 --> 00:24:35.808
Hello, hello, hello.

00:24:35.849 --> 00:24:37.142
"Teen Spirit."

00:24:37.184 --> 00:24:38.769
Serves you right.

00:24:38.811 --> 00:24:40.479
Die, Players.
