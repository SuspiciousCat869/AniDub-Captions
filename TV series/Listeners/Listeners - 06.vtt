00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:15.516
[CROWD screaming]

00:00:26.527 --> 00:00:28.028
‐‐[EARLESS 6B roars]
‐‐[ROZ gasps]

00:00:42.668 --> 00:00:45.045
[ROZ] Papa! The Earless
are going berserk.

00:00:45.087 --> 00:00:46.797
Even More has disappeared!

00:00:46.838 --> 00:00:48.632
I don't know where
my buddy's gone.

00:00:48.674 --> 00:00:50.217
What do we do?

00:00:51.677 --> 00:00:57.349
[ROZ gasps]
More? Is that you? But why?

00:00:57.391 --> 00:00:58.850
Roz, my child.

00:00:58.892 --> 00:01:01.645
It seems as though
the world's deceived us.

00:01:01.687 --> 00:01:04.606
They have no desire to
coexist with the Earless.

00:01:04.648 --> 00:01:06.441
It was all a lie.

00:01:07.985 --> 00:01:09.236
[ROZ]
Papa!

00:01:15.075 --> 00:01:17.160
[ROZ] Papa. We have to
go and get help!

00:01:17.202 --> 00:01:19.371
No, it's too late for me.

00:01:19.413 --> 00:01:21.123
Get away from here, quickly.

00:01:21.164 --> 00:01:22.916
Our country has fallen.

00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:25.252
No. It isn't over yet!

00:01:25.294 --> 00:01:26.253
Please, run!

00:01:26.295 --> 00:01:28.380
He made a promise to us.

00:01:28.422 --> 00:01:30.841
Jimi swore he would
come back to our country.

00:01:30.882 --> 00:01:32.926
He'll fix everything.

00:01:32.968 --> 00:01:35.637
If you just hold on,
I know that we'll all be‐‐

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:40.601
[gasps] Papa!

00:01:52.487 --> 00:01:54.573
You were right. Papa.

00:01:56.867 --> 00:01:59.077
[ROZ]
We have to build the wall.

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:38.468
[MU humming]

00:03:42.973 --> 00:03:46.059
[MU] Can't get enough of
these deep blue skies!

00:03:46.101 --> 00:03:47.811
But I am done with
that weird smell.

00:03:47.853 --> 00:03:50.063
It's probably because
we're near the ocean.

00:03:50.105 --> 00:03:51.982
I always heard there
was a distinctive smell

00:03:52.023 --> 00:03:54.359
in the air close to the sea.

00:03:54.401 --> 00:03:57.738
Yeah, I guess rotting
animal is pretty distinctive.

00:03:57.779 --> 00:04:00.240
What's up with you today?
You seem kinda draggy.

00:04:00.282 --> 00:04:01.867
Well it's been a
pretty rough ride

00:04:01.908 --> 00:04:04.327
and that hasn't been
doing me any favors.

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:06.455
It might be a little better
if we weren't stomping around

00:04:06.496 --> 00:04:08.123
so hard this whole time.

00:04:08.165 --> 00:04:10.959
Scuse you? You got
a problem, you can walk.

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:13.086
Oh yeah, that's an
awesome attitude.

00:04:13.128 --> 00:04:15.255
I wonder what Jimi
would think about it.

00:04:16.506 --> 00:04:19.760
[MU] So, what's it like
having a sibling, anyway?

00:04:19.801 --> 00:04:21.887
[ECHO]
Uh‐‐ Where'd that come from?

00:04:21.928 --> 00:04:24.389
[MU] Like do you and Swell
have the same taste in food?

00:04:24.431 --> 00:04:26.183
Or do the two of you
share some random

00:04:26.224 --> 00:04:28.101
personality quirk or whatever?

00:04:28.143 --> 00:04:30.061
Huh, not exactly.

00:04:30.103 --> 00:04:31.521
I would have
to think about that.

00:04:31.563 --> 00:04:32.898
Well, start thinking.

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:35.609
Uh... I don't know
about personality.

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.069
But our hair tends to
be kinda wild? And‐‐

00:04:38.111 --> 00:04:41.740
[MU gasps]
Holy crap, dude!

00:04:41.782 --> 00:04:43.241
What's with this blue stuff?

00:04:43.283 --> 00:04:45.660
Is it water?
Is all of that water?

00:04:45.702 --> 00:04:47.704
There so much of it!

00:04:47.746 --> 00:04:51.416
[ECHO gasps]
Wait. Easy. Please slow down.

00:04:51.458 --> 00:04:54.211
You kiddin' me? No way
I'm gonna slow down.

00:04:54.252 --> 00:04:55.378
Full speed ahead!

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:58.089
[ECHO]
Let me off!

00:05:00.634 --> 00:05:02.677
[MU]
This is the ocean, huh?

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:04.221
Hey, why don't we
do that fishing thing

00:05:04.262 --> 00:05:05.806
you mentioned before? C'mon!

00:05:05.847 --> 00:05:08.183
We don't have a fishing pole,
or the time for it.

00:05:08.225 --> 00:05:09.893
Unless you feel like
sleeping outside.

00:05:09.935 --> 00:05:11.978
Eww. I definitely don't.

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:15.732
Me neither. We finally
got where we're going.

00:05:16.775 --> 00:05:19.361
[ECHO] This is the place on
the map, no doubt about it.

00:05:19.402 --> 00:05:21.738
So why isn't the
island out there?

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:25.158
And even if it was, there's
no way to get to it from here.

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:26.785
There's a door.

00:05:26.827 --> 00:05:30.872
Right there, see?
That's prob'ly the way inside.

00:05:30.914 --> 00:05:33.124
[ECHO]
Uh... I don't see anything.

00:05:33.166 --> 00:05:35.961
Huh? What, so your eyes
are messed up too now?

00:05:36.002 --> 00:05:37.671
Sure, go with that.

00:05:37.712 --> 00:05:41.967
But if there really is a door,
there's still no island, right?

00:05:42.008 --> 00:05:44.344
‐‐What's the difference?
‐‐Fine then, stay here.

00:05:44.386 --> 00:05:46.596
I'll just swim
over there myself.

00:05:46.638 --> 00:05:48.890
Huh? Hey, what's your deal?

00:05:48.932 --> 00:05:51.726
Are you seriously
gonna throw a tantrum?

00:05:52.644 --> 00:05:57.232
[gasps] Hold on. Hey, Echo?

00:05:57.274 --> 00:05:59.067
Wait a minute. Echo?

00:05:59.109 --> 00:06:01.069
You're not trying to
die on me, right?

00:06:01.111 --> 00:06:02.195
Come on, man.

00:06:02.237 --> 00:06:04.906
Wait. Is this my fault?

00:06:04.948 --> 00:06:07.284
Did he get hurt because
I pushed too hard?

00:06:07.325 --> 00:06:10.161
I... Somebody...
Anybody out there?

00:06:10.203 --> 00:06:11.663
[MU gasps]

00:06:22.716 --> 00:06:26.344
[MU] It's moving, but it
looks like a painting.

00:06:26.386 --> 00:06:27.470
[MU gasps]

00:06:32.642 --> 00:06:34.060
See, I told you.

00:06:34.102 --> 00:06:38.940
C'mon, let's go.
We'll get you some help.

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:48.700
[MU]
Uh... This is super sketch.

00:06:48.742 --> 00:06:51.244
It was midday just a second ago.

00:06:57.042 --> 00:07:02.547
[sighs] Doesn't seem like
anyone's here. But then...

00:07:02.589 --> 00:07:05.342
[gasps] What's up with that?

00:07:07.844 --> 00:07:09.012
[MU]
Echo?

00:07:13.224 --> 00:07:14.684
[MU gasps]
Over here.

00:07:14.726 --> 00:07:16.603
Something's wrong
with my friend!

00:07:16.645 --> 00:07:20.941
He collapsed all of a sudden.
We need medicine or a doctor!

00:07:25.528 --> 00:07:26.863
This kid on the
bench, you mean?

00:07:26.905 --> 00:07:28.949
[MU]
Uh, yeah.

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:31.618
It seemed like he was fine, and
then out of nowhere he just...

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:33.787
[ROZ]
I'm sure it's sound sickness.

00:07:33.828 --> 00:07:36.539
It's a common affliction
among Players' partners,

00:07:36.581 --> 00:07:38.959
but this looks like
quite a severe case.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.753
Have you put him through
more strain than usual lately?

00:07:41.795 --> 00:07:43.463
[MU]
Yeah. I guess so.

00:07:43.505 --> 00:07:46.216
There are medicines that
can relieve the symptoms,

00:07:46.257 --> 00:07:48.218
but it's best if you
let it run its course.

00:07:48.259 --> 00:07:49.803
No way I can do that!

00:07:49.844 --> 00:07:52.138
He looks like he's in
so much pain right now!

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:53.765
[ROZ]
More than you can imagine.

00:07:53.807 --> 00:07:56.685
Losing your humanity is
an excruciating process.

00:07:56.726 --> 00:07:58.103
Huh?

00:07:58.144 --> 00:08:00.146
[ROZ]
He's going to become an Earless,

00:08:00.188 --> 00:08:03.108
and that transformation is
preceded by sound sickness.

00:08:03.149 --> 00:08:06.277
The mind finally
rejecting the body.

00:08:06.319 --> 00:08:09.072
The power of Players has
that effect on normal people.

00:08:09.114 --> 00:08:11.157
It causes a deep
mental agitation,

00:08:11.199 --> 00:08:13.576
but it's masked by the euphoria.

00:08:13.618 --> 00:08:14.744
With prolonged exposure,

00:08:14.786 --> 00:08:17.038
the mind tries to
escape the body.

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:19.165
That drive to dissociate
becomes strong enough

00:08:19.207 --> 00:08:21.668
to manifest physical symptoms.

00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:24.045
It starts with
dizziness, headaches,

00:08:24.087 --> 00:08:25.588
numbness in the limbs.

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:26.548
But this kid.

00:08:26.589 --> 00:08:29.509
It looks like he's reached the
second‐to‐last stage already.

00:08:29.551 --> 00:08:31.094
He'll find his peace soon.

00:08:31.136 --> 00:08:33.179
[MU]
When you say "find his peace"...

00:08:33.221 --> 00:08:35.682
[ROZ]
Yes. You should stay with him.

00:08:35.724 --> 00:08:38.393
The last Earless a Player
subdues is their partner.

00:08:38.435 --> 00:08:39.811
At least, so they say.

00:08:39.853 --> 00:08:41.771
I'm sure that would
make him happy.

00:08:41.813 --> 00:08:43.064
[MU]
But there's another way, right?

00:08:43.106 --> 00:08:43.898
Pardon me?

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:45.734
You said there was
medicine, didn't you?

00:08:45.775 --> 00:08:47.944
[ROZ] Yes, there's a
treatment to slow it down,

00:08:47.986 --> 00:08:49.904
though my supply has been
on the shelf a while.

00:08:49.946 --> 00:08:51.281
But can we still use it?

00:08:51.322 --> 00:08:53.199
[ROZ]
I don't see why you'd want to.

00:08:53.241 --> 00:08:55.535
Why does it matter if
he becomes an Earless?

00:08:55.577 --> 00:08:57.829
Say he does. Would
simply being something

00:08:57.871 --> 00:09:00.165
other than human
make him your enemy?

00:09:00.206 --> 00:09:02.500
What? You're not making sense.

00:09:02.542 --> 00:09:04.753
If there's a way to keep him
from becoming an Earless,

00:09:04.794 --> 00:09:06.004
then that's what we need to do!

00:09:06.046 --> 00:09:10.258
I see. Too bad. I was
hoping you'd understand.

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:11.551
There's no room in this country

00:09:11.593 --> 00:09:14.262
for people who think
the way that you do.

00:09:14.304 --> 00:09:16.431
This empty territory is
where the Earless can

00:09:16.473 --> 00:09:20.435
take refuge from a world that
fears and despises them.

00:09:20.477 --> 00:09:21.644
The Wall.

00:09:22.771 --> 00:09:24.689
No way. You're doing this?

00:09:24.731 --> 00:09:26.691
I'm Roz, the guardian
of this land.

00:09:26.733 --> 00:09:29.944
And you. The way you people
hurt these children.

00:09:29.986 --> 00:09:33.156
Did you expect us to
treat you with any respect?

00:09:33.198 --> 00:09:34.908
I don't know what
it's like out there,

00:09:34.949 --> 00:09:37.702
but right now,
you're the only monster here.

00:09:37.744 --> 00:09:40.038
If you won't watch him pass,
you should leave.

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:42.207
Our country will have
a place for him,

00:09:42.248 --> 00:09:44.667
free from the madness
of the world outside.

00:09:44.709 --> 00:09:46.544
Here, he can be at peace.

00:09:48.713 --> 00:09:52.550
I can't. Not after I
talked him into coming.

00:09:52.592 --> 00:09:54.803
All of this is my fault.

00:09:54.844 --> 00:09:57.097
There are times when
I get sick of him,

00:09:57.138 --> 00:09:59.182
but I'm not leaving him.

00:09:59.224 --> 00:10:01.768
[ROZ] As you wish,
but I still refuse to honor

00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:03.812
a request from a Player.

00:10:05.939 --> 00:10:07.398
Then take this.

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:09.692
I'll give up being a Player.

00:10:09.734 --> 00:10:13.446
So please, save Echo.

00:10:20.745 --> 00:10:22.997
42nd Treadmill?

00:10:23.039 --> 00:10:25.542
Ugh. Is this‐‐

00:10:25.583 --> 00:10:26.334
Echo!

00:10:26.376 --> 00:10:29.462
[ECHO]
Whoa! Um, hi! What happened?

00:10:29.504 --> 00:10:31.047
I'm so glad!

00:10:44.185 --> 00:10:45.478
[ECHO]
Seriously?

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:48.273
Jimi's not here, and you agreed
to quit being a Player?

00:10:48.314 --> 00:10:51.025
That was the only way she
would let you have the medicine.

00:10:51.067 --> 00:10:54.904
[sighs] I can't believe
how gullible you are.

00:10:54.946 --> 00:10:56.406
You honestly thought
sound sickness

00:10:56.447 --> 00:10:57.949
could have turned me
into an Earless?

00:10:57.991 --> 00:11:00.910
Well yeah. Wait, is that
not how that works?

00:11:00.952 --> 00:11:04.789
[ECHO sighs] Somehow or another,
you managed to get fooled again.

00:11:04.831 --> 00:11:06.875
First the soft futon,
and now this.

00:11:06.916 --> 00:11:09.627
Honestly, you're way too quick
to trust people, you know that?

00:11:09.669 --> 00:11:11.671
Ugh, I cannot
believe that chick.

00:11:11.713 --> 00:11:14.340
Roz, you better run!
Better run like hell!

00:11:14.382 --> 00:11:16.718
'Cause I'm gonna
cut you into little‐‐

00:11:16.759 --> 00:11:18.136
Let me go and get it back.

00:11:18.178 --> 00:11:19.470
Really, you think
you're gonna handle

00:11:19.512 --> 00:11:21.055
this whole thing
all by yourself?

00:11:21.097 --> 00:11:24.058
Uh... If she's the type
to pull a stunt like that,

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:25.685
then I think it's best
if I deal with her.

00:11:25.727 --> 00:11:28.855
[MU]
Huh? Dude, you sure?

00:11:28.897 --> 00:11:31.149
Yeah. Trust me on this one.

00:11:31.191 --> 00:11:35.236
I can be tough when it
actually counts. Leave it to me!

00:11:39.574 --> 00:11:43.203
He can be tough?
Not sure I buy that.

00:11:45.955 --> 00:11:51.336
[ROZ] Well. You've recovered.
How did you like the River Styx?

00:11:51.377 --> 00:11:54.214
Was it prettier than
the river of stars?

00:11:54.255 --> 00:11:57.091
[ECHO] I came up here
to give you my thanks.

00:11:57.133 --> 00:12:01.137
You saved my life today.
I owe you for that.

00:12:01.179 --> 00:12:02.680
I screwed up.

00:12:02.722 --> 00:12:05.808
My sound sickness hadn't been
showing many symptoms,

00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:07.685
but if it got any worse,

00:12:07.727 --> 00:12:10.104
I could have transformed
and attacked Mu.

00:12:12.065 --> 00:12:14.609
I'm not the one that
you should be thanking.

00:12:14.651 --> 00:12:16.319
Your Player friend.

00:12:16.361 --> 00:12:19.072
Sorry. I suppose I
should say ex‐Player.

00:12:19.113 --> 00:12:21.824
She's the reason
you're still alive.

00:12:21.866 --> 00:12:24.244
You went through
a great deal to get here,

00:12:24.285 --> 00:12:26.371
but I won't return this.

00:12:26.412 --> 00:12:28.665
It would be a
violation of our pact,

00:12:28.706 --> 00:12:31.292
and I can't abide oath‐breakers.

00:12:31.334 --> 00:12:34.963
There's only one kind of
person I despise more.

00:12:35.004 --> 00:12:37.131
[ECHO] I heard what
happened at the Fest.

00:12:37.173 --> 00:12:38.758
What the Players
did to your people.

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:41.678
I understand why you would
hold a grudge against them.

00:12:41.719 --> 00:12:42.804
But I promise.

00:12:42.845 --> 00:12:44.514
Mu isn't the kind of
person who would‐‐

00:12:44.555 --> 00:12:45.473
[ROZ]
I know.

00:12:45.515 --> 00:12:46.391
[gasps]

00:12:46.432 --> 00:12:48.685
When all my friends
were staring her down,

00:12:48.726 --> 00:12:51.729
she never tried to make
a move for her Equipment,

00:12:51.771 --> 00:12:55.066
and that tells me she knows
when it's best not to fight.

00:12:55.108 --> 00:12:57.360
What's more, this Core
Part was reacting.

00:12:57.402 --> 00:13:00.321
And it's not something
just anyone could use.

00:13:00.363 --> 00:13:01.155
This was‐‐

00:13:01.197 --> 00:13:02.407
[ECHO] The Core Part
that once belonged to

00:13:02.448 --> 00:13:04.659
Jimi Stonefree, right?

00:13:05.535 --> 00:13:08.204
We reached this place by
following Jimi's trail.

00:13:08.246 --> 00:13:10.999
Nobody sent us.
We chose to come.

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:13.710
Please, tell me
about him. Anything.

00:13:15.253 --> 00:13:18.715
[sighs] If that's what it'll
take for you to move on,

00:13:18.756 --> 00:13:20.925
though there's truly
not much to tell.

00:13:22.552 --> 00:13:24.679
[ROZ]
This dead country you see now.

00:13:24.721 --> 00:13:27.140
It was once brimming with life.

00:13:27.181 --> 00:13:29.600
Humans and Earless
living hand‐in‐hand.

00:13:29.642 --> 00:13:31.686
We made no distinction.

00:13:31.728 --> 00:13:34.856
And we all believed we
could sustain that way of life.

00:13:34.897 --> 00:13:37.150
We were sure we could
live in peace with them,

00:13:37.191 --> 00:13:39.444
because all of us wanted that.

00:13:39.485 --> 00:13:42.947
We held a festival for deepening
our friendship with the Earless.

00:13:42.989 --> 00:13:45.283
And on the final day
of the celebration,

00:13:45.325 --> 00:13:48.328
all the people would
release balloons into the sky.

00:13:52.749 --> 00:13:56.377
[JIMI] Ooh, sorry about that!
Kinda lost myself in the moment.

00:13:56.419 --> 00:13:58.963
What were all those
pretty things?

00:13:59.005 --> 00:14:00.757
I hope I didn't see
the last of them.

00:14:00.798 --> 00:14:04.010
Well. If you'd like,
you can release one, too.

00:14:05.136 --> 00:14:07.764
[ROZ] I certainly thought
he was an oddball.

00:14:07.805 --> 00:14:10.767
As I suspect most people would.

00:14:10.808 --> 00:14:13.227
The Earless stayed
grounded there with us.

00:14:13.269 --> 00:14:16.064
It was only our balloons
that would take to the sky.

00:14:16.105 --> 00:14:18.232
Carrying prayers that
we could go on living,

00:14:18.274 --> 00:14:21.152
surrounded with friends,
forever and ever.

00:14:21.194 --> 00:14:22.320
Looking back now,

00:14:22.362 --> 00:14:25.114
it all feels like
some childish fantasy.

00:14:25.156 --> 00:14:26.991
But Jimi didn't think so.

00:14:27.033 --> 00:14:29.369
He said it made us
the most human of all.

00:14:30.787 --> 00:14:33.831
[ROZ] We received word of the
Fest shortly after he arrived.

00:14:33.873 --> 00:14:35.500
Of course our people
were suspicious of

00:14:35.541 --> 00:14:39.212
the other countries' motives,
but if we hadn't played along,

00:14:39.253 --> 00:14:40.755
it would have given
some of those powers

00:14:40.797 --> 00:14:43.800
a clear pretext to attack us.

00:14:43.841 --> 00:14:45.510
What they told us was
that they wanted to

00:14:45.551 --> 00:14:47.970
protect the Earless
outside of our country,

00:14:48.012 --> 00:14:50.848
and that they would need
our research data to do it.

00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:54.477
In the end, we handed it all
over, despite our misgivings.

00:14:54.519 --> 00:14:58.564
But as we feared, their true aim
was to eradicate the Earless.

00:14:58.606 --> 00:15:01.234
They took this Crazy Diamond,
my father's invention,

00:15:01.275 --> 00:15:04.362
and used it to draw these
children to the fight.

00:15:04.404 --> 00:15:06.447
In the cruelest way.

00:15:06.489 --> 00:15:08.825
The light it gave off
even reached this land,

00:15:08.866 --> 00:15:12.286
and drove the Earless
living here into a frenzy.

00:15:12.328 --> 00:15:16.124
They ravaged our country
and fled beyond the sky.

00:15:16.165 --> 00:15:20.044
And no one survived.
It's only me now.

00:15:20.086 --> 00:15:23.881
Jimi was there, doing everything
he could to put a stop to it,

00:15:23.923 --> 00:15:25.633
but he never made it back.

00:15:25.675 --> 00:15:28.010
We all knew the Earless
were dangerous.

00:15:28.052 --> 00:15:30.805
We knew that the rest of the
world lived in fear of them,

00:15:30.847 --> 00:15:33.474
and those fears
were well founded.

00:15:33.516 --> 00:15:35.893
No matter how many
balloons we might offer,

00:15:35.935 --> 00:15:38.604
or how much we
prayed for leniency,

00:15:38.646 --> 00:15:39.939
we knew full well

00:15:39.981 --> 00:15:42.358
that eventually something
would have to give.

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:44.152
But even so.

00:15:44.193 --> 00:15:47.780
Nothing could excuse
all that they took from us.

00:15:47.822 --> 00:15:51.492
[ROZ sighs] Well. That's
as much as I have for you.

00:15:51.534 --> 00:15:53.494
As I said,
there's little to tell.

00:15:53.536 --> 00:15:55.246
I can't give back
your Core Part,

[EIN] A foolish question!
You know exactly what we seek.

00:16:10.094 --> 00:16:12.305
The proof that you are
the Dada successor.

00:16:12.346 --> 00:16:15.183
The treasure that
adorns your... bosom?

[ZENDE]
Her bosom. It's unadorned!

00:16:17.101 --> 00:16:18.060
An empty void, sister!

00:16:18.102 --> 00:16:21.147
[STUR] A featureless expanse,
like a pond on a still day.

00:16:21.189 --> 00:16:22.148
Or a snow‐covered meadow.

00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:24.108
I look at her chest
and my eyes unfocus!

Okay, now you're
just being rude!

Well I gave it up.

Yeah, this Earless
protected me.

And did I just
hear her call it Papa?

Never again will foreign Players
drag our peaceful land

We'll have you
leave our country.

make you more than sorry.

[ZENDE] Dear Sister,
did it not strike you odd

00:17:08.653 --> 00:17:10.112
how many Earless were about?

00:17:10.154 --> 00:17:12.448
It just occurred to me
that we've found the Wall.

00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:15.660
[STUR] Ahh. That silly place
once full of silly people

00:17:15.701 --> 00:17:17.453
who let the monsters
walk among them.

00:17:17.495 --> 00:17:20.122
And yet their presence
is still rather curious.

00:17:20.164 --> 00:17:23.000
[ZENDE] Quite curious indeed!
Because on the day of the Fest,

00:17:23.042 --> 00:17:24.835
every last one of the
Earless in this country

00:17:24.877 --> 00:17:26.462
is supposed to have been killed.

00:17:26.504 --> 00:17:29.257
[STUR] So how is it that the
island still teems with them?

00:17:29.298 --> 00:17:31.634
[ZENDE] A moment ago,
the weakling child cried out

00:17:31.676 --> 00:17:33.344
to the beast that
struck her, no?

00:17:33.386 --> 00:17:35.221
Yes, she called it "Papa."

[STUR]
Interesting. Very interesting!

00:17:39.767 --> 00:17:40.851
[EIN]
Then it's true.

00:17:40.893 --> 00:17:43.938
The masses of Earless among
which this girl resides

00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:47.275
are really the souls of the
massacred people of Gnome!

00:17:48.859 --> 00:17:50.820

Then we'll do this!

We'll take those feelings

00:18:37.491 --> 00:18:39.577
and beat their
heads in with 'em!

00:18:45.166 --> 00:18:50.421
Take this. Save them!
My papa and my country!

00:18:52.548 --> 00:18:55.885
[EIN] At last, the symbol of
Dada makes its appearance.

00:18:55.926 --> 00:18:57.678
[STUR]
Talk about being a sore loser.

00:18:57.720 --> 00:18:59.013
[ZENDE]
Now hand it over!

00:18:59.055 --> 00:19:01.974
Or perhaps, a gentle
toss would be better.

00:19:04.894 --> 00:19:05.686
[STUR]
Hold on!

00:19:05.728 --> 00:19:07.563
Wait, wait, wait,
I wasn't ready!

00:19:07.605 --> 00:19:10.399
We're spinning very quickly!

00:19:10.441 --> 00:19:12.610
[STUR screams]

00:19:12.652 --> 00:19:14.945
[MU]
You done? Is that it?

00:19:14.987 --> 00:19:18.032
You could always hit me with
a blast of noise like before.

00:19:18.074 --> 00:19:20.326
Or maybe you're useless
in a one‐on‐one fight!

00:19:20.368 --> 00:19:24.330
[EIN] Please wait.
I can explain. Let's just talk!

00:19:24.372 --> 00:19:26.082
[MU]
Screw talking!

00:19:27.249 --> 00:19:31.504
[MU] I'll tell exactly you what
I think of you. With my fists!

00:19:32.421 --> 00:19:33.464
[ALL gasp]

00:19:33.506 --> 00:19:34.924
[ZENDE]
Dear Sister has arrived.

00:19:34.965 --> 00:19:35.925
[STUR]
Welcome!

00:19:35.966 --> 00:19:37.885
I kinda feel like
turning it up a notch.

00:19:37.927 --> 00:19:39.637
Are you sure it won't
set off your sickness?

00:19:39.679 --> 00:19:42.723
Nah, we're all good on that.
I got a ton of these.

00:19:42.765 --> 00:19:46.852
Sweet. Right then.
Time to cut loose!

00:19:46.894 --> 00:19:48.229
Let's rock!

00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:52.900
[BOTH]
Top Boost!

00:19:52.942 --> 00:19:55.528
[ALL gasp]

00:19:55.569 --> 00:19:59.949
[ZENDE, STUR, EIN yelling]

00:20:05.079 --> 00:20:09.208
[MU] I missed the blue sky.
It's so nice to see it again.

00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:10.751
[ECHO]
Yeah, same.

00:20:17.758 --> 00:20:19.844
[ROZ] I asked you to
save my country,

00:20:19.885 --> 00:20:21.762
not punch a massive
hole through it.

00:20:21.804 --> 00:20:23.597
Yeah, the roof is
kinda messed up,

00:20:23.639 --> 00:20:25.015
but the country itself is okay!

00:20:25.057 --> 00:20:26.100
[ROZ sighs]

00:20:26.142 --> 00:20:28.686
Hey, wait a sec.
Who are you to complain

00:20:28.728 --> 00:20:31.021
after you played me for
a fool like that earlier?

00:20:31.063 --> 00:20:33.399
Wait, what?
Played you for a fool?

00:20:33.441 --> 00:20:35.609
That's not gonna
work on me twice.

00:20:35.651 --> 00:20:37.236
The whole sound sickness thing.

00:20:37.278 --> 00:20:39.739
Echo was never really
gonna become an Earless!

00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:41.657
He told me himself!

00:20:42.783 --> 00:20:45.369
[ROZ]
Did he? I suppose he would.

00:20:47.455 --> 00:20:49.165
He and I talked earlier.

00:20:49.206 --> 00:20:51.125
You two are searching
for Jimi, aren't you?

00:20:51.167 --> 00:20:52.001
[MU]
Uh‐‐

00:20:52.042 --> 00:20:54.587
[ROZ] After the Fest ended,
a security team was

00:20:54.628 --> 00:20:57.673
escorting him back to us
to have his injuries treated.

00:20:57.715 --> 00:21:01.343
But in the end, Jimi never
reached this country.

00:21:01.385 --> 00:21:03.095
He was likely intercepted,

00:21:03.137 --> 00:21:06.849
and if that's the case,
I think I know who did it.

00:21:06.891 --> 00:21:09.018
The great military
muscle behind the Fest.

00:21:09.059 --> 00:21:10.269
Londinium.

00:21:11.479 --> 00:21:13.522
[ROZ]
They provided Jimi's escort,

00:21:13.564 --> 00:21:16.609
and they were the only ones
who could have undermined it.

00:21:16.650 --> 00:21:19.361
You're likely to find
some clues if you go there.

00:21:19.403 --> 00:21:20.946
Though you should be
aware that Londinium

00:21:20.988 --> 00:21:24.200
is one of the most dangerous
places in the world.

00:21:24.241 --> 00:21:26.911
You would be putting
both your lives at risk,

00:21:26.952 --> 00:21:29.830
but I'm sure that won't
stop you. Will it, now?

00:21:29.872 --> 00:21:33.375
Hell no. Not after we've
made it all this way.

00:21:35.085 --> 00:21:37.922
Honestly. You're
so much like him.

00:21:37.963 --> 00:21:39.423
Now that I think about it,

00:21:39.465 --> 00:21:40.925
when did he even
tell you all that?

00:21:40.966 --> 00:21:42.718
[ROZ] Get too caught up
in gazing at a berry,

00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:44.428
you'll get to watch
a bird carry it off.

00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:45.262
[MU]
Hm?

00:21:45.304 --> 00:21:48.224
[ROZ] If you want it for your
own, you'd best guard it well.

00:21:48.265 --> 00:21:53.979
Hey! Are you making fun of me?
Jeez! Don't be so dumb! Echo!

00:21:56.106 --> 00:21:58.400
[MU] We've gotta take off.
Goodbye, Roz.

00:21:58.442 --> 00:22:00.402
[ROZ]
Bye, take care.

00:22:00.444 --> 00:22:04.448
[MU] Echo! I swear I'm gonna
stitch yer friggin' mouth shut!

00:22:14.208 --> 00:22:15.709
[ROZ'S FATHER grunts]

00:22:15.751 --> 00:22:19.839
Huh? You're asking if we don't
need to patch that hole?

00:22:26.595 --> 00:22:28.472
We can leave it for a bit.

00:22:38.524 --> 00:22:40.109
[ROZ]
It's been a while.

00:24:11.867 --> 00:24:14.787
[JIMI] A leaden sky hangs
heavy over an old alleyway,

00:24:14.828 --> 00:24:17.873
deep in the heart of
the City of the Dead.

00:24:17.915 --> 00:24:20.417
Along a road paved
over with gravestones,

00:24:20.459 --> 00:24:22.711
wilted flowers peek out
from a dustbin,

00:24:22.753 --> 00:24:26.256
and the jailers laugh as
fire rains from the sky.

00:24:26.298 --> 00:24:28.342
A girl with nowhere
left to belong

00:24:28.384 --> 00:24:30.970
and two boys who
wanna be anarchists.

00:24:31.011 --> 00:24:33.013
So let's get our
hands on a new rose,

00:24:33.055 --> 00:24:36.058
and then we can
paint the town red.

00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:37.434
"Day of Rage."

00:24:37.476 --> 00:24:40.396
Raise your fists and
stand with the Players!
