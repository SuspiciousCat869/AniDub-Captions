00:00:22.355 --> 00:00:24.649 align:middle
Man, that movie
really was compelling.

00:00:24.733 --> 00:00:25.942 align:middle
It was.

00:00:26.026 --> 00:00:28.153 align:middle
That last scene was a shock,
but in a good way.

00:00:28.236 --> 00:00:29.571 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Mm-hmm.

00:00:29.988 --> 00:00:32.365 align:middle
Huh? Hmm...

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:34.451 align:middle
Valentine's Day
is next week, huh?

00:00:34.534 --> 00:00:36.661 align:middle
[FUTABA] Wow, time flies.
Speaking of which,

00:00:36.745 --> 00:00:39.164 align:middle
what kind of chocolate
should I make this year?

00:00:39.247 --> 00:00:42.751 align:middle
Not fair, your chocolate's so
good, it's impossible to decide!

00:00:42.834 --> 00:00:46.254 align:middle
[YUTO groans]
Where the heck am I?

00:00:46.338 --> 00:00:49.382 align:middle
My map app really
let me down this time.

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:53.887 align:middle
[NATSUMI]
Hey, there!

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:55.472 align:middle
[YUTO]
Huh?

00:00:55.555 --> 00:00:57.599 align:middle
We're pretty familiar with this
part of town, if you need help.

00:00:57.682 --> 00:01:00.018 align:middle
Can we show you the way?

00:01:00.101 --> 00:01:03.271 align:middle
Oh! Would you, really?

00:01:03.938 --> 00:01:05.482 align:middle
[FUTABA]
This is that over there,

00:01:05.565 --> 00:01:07.150 align:middle
and you get there like this.

00:01:07.233 --> 00:01:09.277 align:middle
Ah...!

00:01:09.361 --> 00:01:10.528 align:middle
I can never thank you enough

00:01:10.612 --> 00:01:11.988 align:middle
for what you've done
for me here today!

00:01:12.072 --> 00:01:14.657 align:middle
Thank you, ladies!
Thank you so much!

00:01:14.741 --> 00:01:16.284 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Sure, no worries.

00:01:16.368 --> 00:01:17.243 align:middle
Can you manage that?

00:01:17.327 --> 00:01:18.495 align:middle
Getting to it alone?

00:01:18.578 --> 00:01:20.538 align:middle
If you want,
we could walk you there.

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:23.249 align:middle
Oh, no thanks.

00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:25.085 align:middle
The truth is,
I'm meeting somebody,

00:01:25.168 --> 00:01:27.253 align:middle
and they'd tease me if you did.

00:01:27.337 --> 00:01:28.880 align:middle
Well, okay then.

00:01:28.963 --> 00:01:30.840 align:middle
You be careful.

00:01:30.924 --> 00:01:33.218 align:middle
I know my way now,
so I'm gonna be just fine.

00:01:33.301 --> 00:01:35.679 align:middle
Thank you both
for all of your help!

00:01:41.601 --> 00:01:45.271 align:middle
[NATSUMI] Futaba, how long
do you plan to keep waving?

00:01:45.355 --> 00:01:46.690 align:middle
Don't you get it?

00:01:46.773 --> 00:01:48.358 align:middle
He called us both "ladies."

00:01:48.441 --> 00:01:49.734 align:middle
As in, me, too.

00:01:57.909 --> 00:01:59.703 align:middle
Yo, Igarashi!

00:01:59.786 --> 00:02:02.455 align:middle
You look like you're
in a good mood.

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:04.541 align:middle
Lately it seems people
are finally starting

00:02:04.624 --> 00:02:07.002 align:middle
to recognize me as the
full-grown woman I am.

00:02:07.085 --> 00:02:09.087 align:middle
And I mean,
it's about time, am I right?

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.089 align:middle
Because let's be real,
I think for anyone

00:02:11.172 --> 00:02:13.758 align:middle
who knows the
first thing about me,

00:02:13.842 --> 00:02:15.802 align:middle
considering me
"childish" is absurd.

00:02:15.885 --> 00:02:18.805 align:middle
[laughs]
What're you goin' on about?

00:02:18.888 --> 00:02:21.599 align:middle
That's literally what
I'm seeing right now.

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:01.241 align:middle
I want real chocolate!

00:04:01.324 --> 00:04:03.284 align:middle
Not pity chocolate!

00:04:04.035 --> 00:04:05.745 align:middle
What's with you all of a sudden?

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:08.081 align:middle
Valentine's Day
is coming up soon.

00:04:08.164 --> 00:04:10.291 align:middle
And for once, I'd like to get
some heartfelt chocolate

00:04:10.375 --> 00:04:12.210 align:middle
from someone who's into me!

00:04:12.293 --> 00:04:13.962 align:middle
You want it from "someone"?

00:04:14.045 --> 00:04:15.422 align:middle
You don't care who?

00:04:15.505 --> 00:04:17.590 align:middle
[HIJIKATA] Well, chocolate
from Sakurai would be ideal,

00:04:17.674 --> 00:04:18.591 align:middle
of course.

00:04:18.675 --> 00:04:20.051 align:middle
You get hers every year.

00:04:20.135 --> 00:04:21.636 align:middle
The polite kind, I mean.

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.973 align:middle
Tsk, tsk, tsk! You never know,
this year could be different.

00:04:25.056 --> 00:04:26.516 align:middle
Huh?

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:28.101 align:middle
I can't put my finger on why,

00:04:28.184 --> 00:04:30.979 align:middle
but I feel like our eyes have
met more often than last year.

00:04:31.062 --> 00:04:33.064 align:middle
Twice out of every
ten times for sure.

00:04:33.148 --> 00:04:34.399 align:middle
If that's true,

00:04:34.482 --> 00:04:36.443 align:middle
it's just because you stare
at her way too much.

00:04:36.526 --> 00:04:37.819 align:middle
[SAKURAI]
Huh?

00:04:37.902 --> 00:04:40.822 align:middle
Hey, what's going on, everyone?

00:04:40.905 --> 00:04:42.198 align:middle
Well, hello there!

00:04:42.282 --> 00:04:44.159 align:middle
Hey, Sakurai.

00:04:47.245 --> 00:04:48.955 align:middle
You gonna ask her?

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:53.251 align:middle
[HIJIKATA] Wow, Valentine's
Day's coming up, isn't it?

00:04:53.335 --> 00:04:54.544 align:middle
[SAKURAI]
Huh?

00:04:54.627 --> 00:04:56.880 align:middle
Oh my gosh,
it's that time already?

00:04:56.963 --> 00:04:59.049 align:middle
Guess I'd better
start getting ready, then.

00:04:59.132 --> 00:05:02.302 align:middle
So, uh, when you say
you need to "get ready,"

00:05:02.385 --> 00:05:04.721 align:middle
could it be that this year,
there's someone you'd like

00:05:04.804 --> 00:05:07.182 align:middle
to give some
special chocolate to?

00:05:07.265 --> 00:05:10.018 align:middle
[SAKURAI]
Hmm? Sorry, special how?

00:05:10.101 --> 00:05:13.772 align:middle
[HIJIKATA] I'm talking
about heartfelt chocolate.

00:05:13.855 --> 00:05:15.565 align:middle
[SAKURAI chuckles]
Ah.

00:05:15.648 --> 00:05:17.734 align:middle
No, I'm saying I need
to get the chocolate prepped

00:05:17.817 --> 00:05:19.444 align:middle
for everyone in the office.

00:05:19.527 --> 00:05:21.404 align:middle
Like I do every year.

00:05:24.824 --> 00:05:26.409 align:middle
See, what did I tell you?

00:05:26.493 --> 00:05:29.245 align:middle
We won't know anything for
certain until the day arrives.

00:05:33.917 --> 00:05:35.919 align:middle
These are heavy.

00:05:39.422 --> 00:05:42.676 align:middle
Takeda? Huh?

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:46.763 align:middle
Takeda! Where are you? In here?

00:05:46.846 --> 00:05:48.932 align:middle
[CHIEF]
Ah, looking for Takeda?

00:05:49.015 --> 00:05:51.351 align:middle
He went to make
sales calls this afternoon.

00:05:51.434 --> 00:05:54.437 align:middle
Oh, I had no idea.

00:05:56.356 --> 00:05:58.817 align:middle
[CHIEF] You wishing you were
there with him, Igarashi?

00:05:58.900 --> 00:05:59.943 align:middle
Huh?!

00:06:00.026 --> 00:06:02.237 align:middle
Please don't get
the wrong idea, here!

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:03.780 align:middle
I was only wondering
where he could've gone,

00:06:03.863 --> 00:06:05.615 align:middle
in a casual way.

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:07.659 align:middle
[phone rings]

00:06:08.952 --> 00:06:11.329 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Hello! That you, Chief?

00:06:11.413 --> 00:06:13.415 align:middle
[chuckles]
Takeda! How are things?

00:06:13.498 --> 00:06:14.833 align:middle
How did it go?

00:06:14.916 --> 00:06:16.167 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Came off without a hitch,

00:06:16.251 --> 00:06:18.628 align:middle
so it went as well as
we could've hoped.

00:06:18.712 --> 00:06:20.755 align:middle
[CHIEF] Well, it's
almost quitting time now,

00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:23.299 align:middle
so you can feel free to head
straight home from there.

00:06:23.383 --> 00:06:25.552 align:middle
Huh? Are you sure?

00:06:25.635 --> 00:06:27.679 align:middle
[CHIEF] Yeah, everyone
here's already halfway

00:06:27.762 --> 00:06:29.347 align:middle
to the door, anyway.

00:06:29.431 --> 00:06:31.766 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Okay. Bye, then!

00:06:33.643 --> 00:06:34.728 align:middle
Wait a minute.

00:06:34.811 --> 00:06:37.230 align:middle
That means she's
on her way home, too.

00:06:49.826 --> 00:06:52.245 align:middle
[FUTABA]
See you guys tomorrow!

00:06:52.328 --> 00:06:54.456 align:middle
All right, take care!

00:06:57.542 --> 00:07:00.628 align:middle
[TAKEDA] I've got a little time
before she gets here.

00:07:00.712 --> 00:07:02.380 align:middle
Guess I'll grab a coffee.

00:07:02.464 --> 00:07:04.632 align:middle
[YUTO]
Help me! Help!

00:07:04.716 --> 00:07:05.759 align:middle
You shut your mouth.

00:07:05.842 --> 00:07:07.052 align:middle
This is a shakedown!

00:07:07.135 --> 00:07:08.595 align:middle
[THUG B]
Fork over the dough, now!

00:07:08.678 --> 00:07:10.013 align:middle
[cries]

00:07:10.096 --> 00:07:12.182 align:middle
[thudding sounds]

00:07:13.308 --> 00:07:14.142 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
You okay?

00:07:14.225 --> 00:07:16.061 align:middle
[YUTO]
Uh, yes, sir.

00:07:16.144 --> 00:07:17.520 align:middle
Then, catch!

00:07:19.147 --> 00:07:20.523 align:middle
Thank you.

00:07:20.607 --> 00:07:22.984 align:middle
I appreciate this more
than you know, mister.

00:07:23.068 --> 00:07:25.153 align:middle
Hey, don't even
give it a second thought.

00:07:25.236 --> 00:07:28.615 align:middle
I keep myself fit especially
for times like these.

00:07:28.698 --> 00:07:30.575 align:middle
But you listen to me, kid.

00:07:32.202 --> 00:07:33.703 align:middle
Life's already hard enough,

00:07:33.787 --> 00:07:36.623 align:middle
so you should learn not to let
these little things get to ya.

00:07:36.706 --> 00:07:39.793 align:middle
[YUTO] Was it really
such a little thing?

00:07:39.876 --> 00:07:42.337 align:middle
Anyway, it seems
like no matter what I do,

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:45.382 align:middle
nothing works out
for me the way I want.

00:07:45.465 --> 00:07:49.844 align:middle
I mean, it's as if someone's
always coming to my rescue.

00:07:49.928 --> 00:07:52.889 align:middle
Just the other day, in fact,
I got myself a bit lost,

00:07:52.972 --> 00:07:56.434 align:middle
and these two kind people helped
me without my even asking.

00:07:56.518 --> 00:07:58.603 align:middle
Well, there's certainly
nothing wrong with that.

00:07:58.687 --> 00:08:01.606 align:middle
I think it's good that you're
capable of relying on others.

00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:03.775 align:middle
Do you really think so?

00:08:03.858 --> 00:08:04.901 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Takeda!

00:08:04.984 --> 00:08:06.820 align:middle
Sorry to keep you waiting!

00:08:08.738 --> 00:08:09.614 align:middle
Oh, wow!

00:08:09.698 --> 00:08:10.865 align:middle
Hey, aren't you...?

00:08:10.949 --> 00:08:12.200 align:middle
Huh?!

00:08:12.283 --> 00:08:14.285 align:middle
Did everything go
okay the other day?

00:08:14.369 --> 00:08:15.370 align:middle
Wait, back up.

00:08:15.453 --> 00:08:17.455 align:middle
Am I to take it you guys
know each other?

00:08:17.539 --> 00:08:19.040 align:middle
Well, sort of, yeah.

00:08:19.124 --> 00:08:22.127 align:middle
I can't thank you enough for all
of your kindness the other day.

00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:23.920 align:middle
No trouble at all.

00:08:26.256 --> 00:08:29.551 align:middle
So, um, by the way,
my name's Yuto Sakurai.

00:08:29.634 --> 00:08:31.094 align:middle
When we met,
I couldn't find where

00:08:31.177 --> 00:08:33.596 align:middle
I was s'posed to
meet my big sister.

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:34.889 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Sakurai?

00:08:34.973 --> 00:08:36.433 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Big sister?

00:08:36.516 --> 00:08:39.394 align:middle
Now I see the resemblance.

00:08:39.477 --> 00:08:40.395 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
You're right.

00:08:40.478 --> 00:08:41.688 align:middle
But I'm...

00:08:41.771 --> 00:08:44.524 align:middle
[SAKURAI]
Yuto! Sorry I'm late!

00:08:44.607 --> 00:08:46.026 align:middle
Hi, Sis!

00:08:47.902 --> 00:08:49.320 align:middle
That's strange!

00:08:49.404 --> 00:08:51.614 align:middle
I wouldn't've guessed I'd be
seeing the two of you here.

00:08:52.741 --> 00:08:54.909 align:middle
[FUTABA]
So, you are related to her!

00:08:54.993 --> 00:08:59.706 align:middle
[laughs]
It sure is a small world, huh?

00:08:59.789 --> 00:09:01.041 align:middle
Hold on a second.

00:09:01.124 --> 00:09:02.917 align:middle
Do both of you know my sister?

00:09:03.001 --> 00:09:04.210 align:middle
Yeah.

00:09:04.294 --> 00:09:05.795 align:middle
We work at the same office.

00:09:05.879 --> 00:09:07.505 align:middle
Oh!

00:09:07.589 --> 00:09:10.467 align:middle
[TAKEDA] Hey, we were just
about to go have some ramen.

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:12.761 align:middle
What do you think,
you guys want to come with?

00:09:12.844 --> 00:09:14.304 align:middle
[YUTO]
Ramen?

00:09:14.387 --> 00:09:16.389 align:middle
Yeah, but this was just a
spur-of-the-moment thing,

00:09:16.473 --> 00:09:17.474 align:middle
you know!

00:09:17.557 --> 00:09:19.476 align:middle
Great timing.
I was getting hungry.

00:09:19.559 --> 00:09:20.852 align:middle
Please--

00:09:20.935 --> 00:09:23.938 align:middle
Please forgive him,
but we have plans this evening.

00:09:24.022 --> 00:09:25.899 align:middle
We're going now, Yuto.

00:09:27.692 --> 00:09:30.320 align:middle
[BOTH]
See you guys later!

00:09:30.403 --> 00:09:32.572 align:middle
Be careful, now!

00:09:32.655 --> 00:09:34.908 align:middle
Well, we should get moving, too.

00:09:34.991 --> 00:09:36.368 align:middle
Sounds good.

00:09:36.451 --> 00:09:37.660 align:middle
Aw, man.

00:09:37.744 --> 00:09:38.953 align:middle
I wanted to eat some ramen.

00:09:39.037 --> 00:09:40.747 align:middle
That sounded good.

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:42.374 align:middle
Maybe next time.

00:09:42.457 --> 00:09:43.958 align:middle
[STUDENT A]
They're so expensive!

00:09:44.042 --> 00:09:46.169 align:middle
[STUDENT B]
Wow, they really are pricey.

00:09:46.252 --> 00:09:47.337 align:middle
They've got them in our color!

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:48.296 align:middle
[STUDENT B]
Yeah, they do!

00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:49.839 align:middle
[STUDENT A]
Aren't they cute?

00:09:49.923 --> 00:09:51.591 align:middle
[YUTO] They're really
excited, aren't they?

00:09:51.675 --> 00:09:52.926 align:middle
[SAKURAI]
Looks that way.

00:09:53.009 --> 00:09:55.345 align:middle
You might even get some
chocolate this year, Yuto.

00:09:55.428 --> 00:09:57.847 align:middle
Me? Seriously?

00:09:57.931 --> 00:10:01.559 align:middle
Yeah, I bet there's a special
girl out there who likes you.

00:10:04.062 --> 00:10:06.981 align:middle
No! Stop it, there is not!

00:10:12.404 --> 00:10:13.363 align:middle
[STUDENT B]
Yeah.

00:10:13.446 --> 00:10:15.657 align:middle
[STUDENT C]
I bet those are so good.

00:10:22.539 --> 00:10:25.375 align:middle
[STUDENT E] I wonder if Sakurai
gave anyone any chocolate.

00:10:25.458 --> 00:10:27.293 align:middle
[SAKURAI]
Huh?

00:10:27.377 --> 00:10:29.629 align:middle
I know, I'm kinda
dying to find out.

00:10:29.713 --> 00:10:31.715 align:middle
Let's just ask all the girls.

00:10:31.798 --> 00:10:33.425 align:middle
[STUDENT F]
That's a great idea!

00:10:40.807 --> 00:10:44.144 align:middle
Hey, did you give anyone
any chocolate, Touko?

00:10:44.227 --> 00:10:47.897 align:middle
[SAKURAI] Nuh-uh. That's not
really something I usually--

00:10:47.981 --> 00:10:52.068 align:middle
Oh, yeah, It's different
for you popular girls.

00:10:52.152 --> 00:10:53.486 align:middle
They come flocking,

00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:57.198 align:middle
and you don't even have
to bribe them with chocolate.

00:10:57.282 --> 00:11:00.326 align:middle
Hey! What does that mean?

00:11:05.123 --> 00:11:06.916 align:middle
[YUTO]
Sis?

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.627 align:middle
Are we grabbing stuff
for dinner on the way home?

00:11:09.711 --> 00:11:11.379 align:middle
[SAKURAI]
Oh. Sure!

00:11:19.012 --> 00:11:20.055 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Howdy!

00:11:20.138 --> 00:11:21.890 align:middle
[SHOP OWNER]
Welcome, folks! Hmm?

00:11:22.849 --> 00:11:24.601 align:middle
Oh, it's you, Harumi.

00:11:24.684 --> 00:11:28.480 align:middle
[TAKEDA] Hey, that's no way
to talk to a customer.

00:11:28.563 --> 00:11:29.564 align:middle
[SHOP OWNER]
Hmph.

00:11:29.647 --> 00:11:32.650 align:middle
I'd completely forgotten
you were one.

00:11:32.734 --> 00:11:35.111 align:middle
[TAKEDA] This is Igarashi;
we work together.

00:11:35.195 --> 00:11:37.530 align:middle
Make her some of
your tasty ramen, eh?

00:11:37.614 --> 00:11:39.449 align:middle
It's very nice to meet you.

00:11:39.532 --> 00:11:42.452 align:middle
Well, thanks, and same to you!

00:11:42.535 --> 00:11:44.412 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Do you come here often, Takeda?

00:11:44.496 --> 00:11:47.248 align:middle
He called you by name
just a minute ago.

00:11:47.332 --> 00:11:48.541 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Oh, yeah.

00:11:48.625 --> 00:11:51.670 align:middle
I've been coming here
since I was a student.

00:11:52.587 --> 00:11:54.297 align:middle
[SHOP OWNER]
So, what can I get ya'?

00:11:54.381 --> 00:11:58.593 align:middle
If I may, could I recommend--the
Valentine's Day special?

00:11:58.677 --> 00:12:00.345 align:middle
You made chocolate ramen?

00:12:00.428 --> 00:12:03.098 align:middle
Oh, jeez, not another
one of your crazy ideas.

00:12:03.181 --> 00:12:04.974 align:middle
What do you mean, "crazy"?

00:12:05.058 --> 00:12:07.602 align:middle
Always pushing the envelope,
that's my thing.

00:12:07.686 --> 00:12:10.522 align:middle
It's my policy, and my mantra!

00:12:10.605 --> 00:12:12.649 align:middle
I admit it is
pretty gutsy of you,

00:12:12.732 --> 00:12:15.068 align:middle
but who in their right mind
is gonna eat that stuff?

00:12:15.151 --> 00:12:16.695 align:middle
What?!

00:12:16.778 --> 00:12:19.656 align:middle
[TAKEDA] I'm not that
big on sweets, anyway.

00:12:21.074 --> 00:12:22.701 align:middle
Give me the tonkotsu.

00:12:22.784 --> 00:12:25.412 align:middle
Uh. I'll have the same thing.

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:35.296 align:middle
[inaudible]

00:12:39.134 --> 00:12:40.176 align:middle
[BOY]
Mom, look!

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.220 align:middle
[MOTHER]
Shush! Don't stare!

00:12:42.303 --> 00:12:43.763 align:middle
Check it out!

00:12:43.847 --> 00:12:45.890 align:middle
When I walk up here on this,
I'm actually taller than you!

00:12:45.974 --> 00:12:49.561 align:middle
Yep, you sure are.
[giggles]

00:12:49.644 --> 00:12:51.813 align:middle
[CASHIER]
Uh, sir, I'm sorry,

00:12:51.896 --> 00:12:55.358 align:middle
but I'm afraid
you'll need to pay in cash.

00:13:03.158 --> 00:13:07.245 align:middle
[fighting sounds]

00:13:07.328 --> 00:13:08.747 align:middle
[GAME ANNOUNCER]
Nice hit!

00:13:17.339 --> 00:13:21.301 align:middle
[NATSUMI] Mmm! These
are all so scrumptious! Mm!

00:13:21.384 --> 00:13:22.469 align:middle
I think there's no doubt

00:13:22.552 --> 00:13:25.388 align:middle
your co-workers will
be pleased, Futaba.

00:13:25.472 --> 00:13:26.973 align:middle
Do you think so?

00:13:30.352 --> 00:13:33.605 align:middle
I will not be giving any
chocolate to Takeda!

00:13:33.688 --> 00:13:37.984 align:middle
Don't get all freaked out; no
one said anything about him.

00:13:38.068 --> 00:13:40.153 align:middle
Wouldn't you feel sorry
for Takeda, though?

00:13:40.236 --> 00:13:42.614 align:middle
The only one left out?

00:13:54.125 --> 00:13:56.503 align:middle
[EMPLOYEE B]
Wow!

00:13:56.586 --> 00:13:57.462 align:middle
[EMPLOYEE C]
What's that?

00:13:57.545 --> 00:13:58.838 align:middle
[EMPLOYEE B]
It looks so good!

00:13:58.922 --> 00:14:01.091 align:middle
[SAKURAI] That cake is
actually homemade, isn't it?

00:14:01.174 --> 00:14:03.468 align:middle
Who would make
something this wonderful?

00:14:03.551 --> 00:14:06.304 align:middle
Whoa! I don't know.

00:14:06.388 --> 00:14:08.014 align:middle
It looks too good to eat.

00:14:08.098 --> 00:14:10.809 align:middle
Listen, your chocolate looks
like a little miracle, too!

00:14:10.892 --> 00:14:13.103 align:middle
You even added
cute illustrations.

00:14:13.186 --> 00:14:15.980 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Oh, I like to draw, that's all.

00:14:16.064 --> 00:14:20.235 align:middle
[SAKURAI] Aw! This bear
looks just like Takeda.

00:14:20.318 --> 00:14:22.237 align:middle
You are giving him one,
too, aren't you?

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:27.909 align:middle
Ah! Well, I mean, he's always
looking out for me, so...

00:14:27.992 --> 00:14:29.202 align:middle
Yeah.

00:14:29.285 --> 00:14:32.288 align:middle
But he doesn't eat sweets
very often, anyway.

00:14:32.372 --> 00:14:33.873 align:middle
You know what?

00:14:33.957 --> 00:14:36.584 align:middle
I think you're pretty amazing.

00:14:51.683 --> 00:14:54.602 align:middle
Is something going on
with Kazama?

00:14:57.105 --> 00:14:58.773 align:middle
[HIJIKATA]
Good morning, all!

00:14:58.857 --> 00:15:02.068 align:middle
Yes, it's the day we've all been
waiting for, Valentine's Day!

00:15:02.152 --> 00:15:05.363 align:middle
[SAKURAI]
Yep, that's right.

00:15:05.447 --> 00:15:06.614 align:middle
Here you go.

00:15:06.698 --> 00:15:08.450 align:middle
Thanks for being a great help.

00:15:08.533 --> 00:15:10.326 align:middle
Thanks, Sakurai, that's so nice.

00:15:10.410 --> 00:15:12.454 align:middle
Just to be clear
before we do this.

00:15:12.537 --> 00:15:15.790 align:middle
My chocolate's the
heartfelt kind, isn't it?

00:15:15.874 --> 00:15:17.334 align:middle
Well, am I right?

00:15:17.417 --> 00:15:19.252 align:middle
[SAKURAI]
Hmm...

00:15:19.336 --> 00:15:21.546 align:middle
Nope, it's just to be nice.

00:15:21.629 --> 00:15:23.340 align:middle
Of course it is.

00:15:25.467 --> 00:15:26.426 align:middle
[SAKURAI]
That's weird.

00:15:26.509 --> 00:15:29.304 align:middle
All your chocolate's
gone, Hijikata.

00:15:29.387 --> 00:15:31.598 align:middle
I set it down right here.

00:15:37.937 --> 00:15:40.065 align:middle
[TSUKISHIRO] Actually,
this is surprisingly good.

00:15:40.648 --> 00:15:42.817 align:middle
[SAKURAI]
That's for Hijikata!

00:15:42.901 --> 00:15:43.777 align:middle
Who?

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:45.445 align:middle
[HIJIKATA]
Hey, hold on there!

00:15:45.528 --> 00:15:46.821 align:middle
That's mine. Give it--

00:15:51.993 --> 00:15:53.370 align:middle
[TSUKISHIRO] I'm gonna
need you to simmer down

00:15:53.453 --> 00:15:57.332 align:middle
and feast on this instead.

00:15:57.415 --> 00:16:00.960 align:middle
It's my special homemade
vodka with chocolate.

00:16:01.044 --> 00:16:02.921 align:middle
Perfection, right?

00:16:07.676 --> 00:16:09.552 align:middle
[OOISHI]
Hey, are you okay?

00:16:09.636 --> 00:16:11.221 align:middle
I scored some chocolate.

00:16:11.304 --> 00:16:12.806 align:middle
So, yeah, I'm good.

00:16:12.889 --> 00:16:14.974 align:middle
[OOISHI]
That's a pretty low bar.

00:16:25.819 --> 00:16:27.028 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Hey, there.

00:16:27.112 --> 00:16:29.406 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Oh, good afternoon.

00:16:29.489 --> 00:16:31.157 align:middle
[TAKEDA sighs]

00:16:31.241 --> 00:16:32.492 align:middle
Oh!

00:16:32.575 --> 00:16:34.869 align:middle
Takeda, where did you get that?

00:16:34.953 --> 00:16:36.788 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Oh, you talkin' about this?

00:16:36.871 --> 00:16:38.373 align:middle
I just got it at a client's.

00:16:38.456 --> 00:16:42.460 align:middle
[FUTABA gasps] You know, That's
some pretty expensive chocolate!

00:16:42.544 --> 00:16:45.672 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Is it really? Huh...

00:16:45.755 --> 00:16:48.758 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Compared to that, mine's just...

00:16:51.678 --> 00:16:52.637 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Wait a sec.

00:16:52.721 --> 00:16:55.515 align:middle
Could that be
heartfelt chocolate?

00:16:55.598 --> 00:16:58.768 align:middle
People don't give
fancy stuff to be polite.

00:16:58.852 --> 00:17:01.021 align:middle
Yo, are you all right?

00:17:01.104 --> 00:17:03.273 align:middle
Hey. Personal space!

00:17:03.356 --> 00:17:05.275 align:middle
Ha! Sorry about that.

00:17:05.358 --> 00:17:07.277 align:middle
You had a weird look
on your face.

00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:08.862 align:middle
[FUTABA]
And whose fault is that?

00:17:08.945 --> 00:17:11.740 align:middle
--Huh?
--[sighs] Just forget it.

00:17:11.823 --> 00:17:15.243 align:middle
Well, then, do you want
to help me eat all this?

00:17:15.326 --> 00:17:18.455 align:middle
It's from the wife of
the chief at Maki Textiles.

00:17:18.538 --> 00:17:21.166 align:middle
And by the way,
he sends you his regards.

00:17:21.249 --> 00:17:22.959 align:middle
But, uh...

00:17:23.043 --> 00:17:24.961 align:middle
How do you pronounce this?

00:17:25.045 --> 00:17:27.547 align:middle
The chief at Maki Textiles, huh?

00:17:29.591 --> 00:17:32.177 align:middle
Now I know who you mean!

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:34.179 align:middle
Ah! How funny is that?

00:17:34.262 --> 00:17:38.099 align:middle
[TAKEDA] Uh, go-vah-dee,
or go-va-di or somethin'.

00:17:38.183 --> 00:17:39.142 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Um, here.

00:17:39.225 --> 00:17:40.477 align:middle
Huh?

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:41.561 align:middle
They're homemade.

00:17:41.644 --> 00:17:43.521 align:middle
So, not fancy.

00:17:43.605 --> 00:17:46.566 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
You made these? Wow!

00:17:46.649 --> 00:17:49.319 align:middle
Hey, did you draw
that cute little bear, too?

00:17:49.402 --> 00:17:52.155 align:middle
Well, yeah.

00:17:52.238 --> 00:17:53.823 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Thank you!

00:17:53.907 --> 00:17:55.367 align:middle
Mind if I have some now?

00:17:55.450 --> 00:17:57.410 align:middle
No. Go ahead.

00:17:57.494 --> 00:17:59.788 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Awesome! Thanks!

00:18:04.042 --> 00:18:07.003 align:middle
So, uh, whadaya think,
does it taste okay?

00:18:07.087 --> 00:18:09.089 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Are you kidding? It's great!

00:18:10.757 --> 00:18:13.218 align:middle
Oh, I'm glad. That's a relief.

00:18:13.301 --> 00:18:14.427 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Hmm?

00:18:14.511 --> 00:18:16.846 align:middle
Hold on.
This tastes like green tea.

00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:19.808 align:middle
That's right, I mixed in a
little powdered green tea.

00:18:19.891 --> 00:18:22.268 align:middle
I just thought, that way it
might be more agreeable

00:18:22.352 --> 00:18:25.021 align:middle
to someone who doesn't
eat sweets that much.

00:18:25.105 --> 00:18:27.148 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Really? How interesting!

00:18:27.232 --> 00:18:28.817 align:middle
Makes a lotta sense!

00:18:44.207 --> 00:18:46.668 align:middle
[SAKURAI]
Hey, are you all right?

00:18:48.211 --> 00:18:51.589 align:middle
Not to push, but you
look kind of down lately.

00:18:51.673 --> 00:18:54.426 align:middle
[KAZAMA]
I'm fine. Just fine.

00:18:54.509 --> 00:18:55.635 align:middle
[SAKURAI]
Hmm...

00:18:55.719 --> 00:18:57.470 align:middle
Seriously, what's wrong?

00:18:57.554 --> 00:18:59.389 align:middle
Are you not feeling well?

00:18:59.472 --> 00:19:01.141 align:middle
[KAZAMA sighs]

00:19:01.224 --> 00:19:04.936 align:middle
[SAKURAI] You're not
acting like your usual self.

00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:09.232 align:middle
And I... I was so looking
forward to giving you this.

00:19:09.315 --> 00:19:10.859 align:middle
Huh?

00:19:11.818 --> 00:19:14.946 align:middle
[KAZAMA]
A chocolate bar? Why?

00:19:15.030 --> 00:19:17.907 align:middle
Because it is
Valentine's Day, after all.

00:19:17.991 --> 00:19:19.492 align:middle
Here.

00:19:23.121 --> 00:19:26.708 align:middle
[KAZAMA] So, which kind
of chocolate is this?

00:19:26.791 --> 00:19:29.210 align:middle
Yeah, I wonder, huh?

00:19:29.294 --> 00:19:31.296 align:middle
[KAZAMA] Well,
I'm a hundred percent sure

00:19:31.379 --> 00:19:32.756 align:middle
you're being courteous.

00:19:32.839 --> 00:19:34.466 align:middle
Uh.

00:19:37.218 --> 00:19:39.054 align:middle
[SAKURAI]
Why do you assume that?

00:19:39.137 --> 00:19:40.472 align:middle
[KAZAMA]
Hmm?

00:19:40.555 --> 00:19:43.058 align:middle
Because it's just
a chocolate bar.

00:19:46.144 --> 00:19:48.480 align:middle
Sakurai?

00:19:48.563 --> 00:19:51.524 align:middle
A chocolate bar is still
chocolate, you know!

00:19:51.608 --> 00:19:52.734 align:middle
I know the homemade

00:19:52.817 --> 00:19:55.236 align:middle
or expensive chocolate
might've tasted better,

00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:58.114 align:middle
but it's still perfectly
good chocolate!

00:19:58.198 --> 00:20:02.327 align:middle
Come on, it's really the thought
that counts, anyway, isn't it?

00:20:02.410 --> 00:20:05.372 align:middle
Never thought you'd be
the type to judge things

00:20:05.455 --> 00:20:08.083 align:middle
based only on appearance.

00:20:16.466 --> 00:20:18.635 align:middle
[KAZAMA]
I thought I saw...

00:20:18.718 --> 00:20:21.805 align:middle
Weren't you walking with
some other guy the other day?

00:20:23.515 --> 00:20:25.642 align:middle
[KAZAMA]
You gave it to him, right?

00:20:25.725 --> 00:20:27.727 align:middle
Your heartfelt chocolate,
I mean.

00:20:27.811 --> 00:20:30.313 align:middle
He's the one.

00:20:30.397 --> 00:20:31.815 align:middle
Wait, hold on,

00:20:31.898 --> 00:20:33.983 align:middle
do you mean my little brother?

00:20:41.449 --> 00:20:46.287 align:middle
Ahhhh. Looks like someone
got the wrong idea.

00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:50.583 align:middle
[SAKURA]
For the record,

00:20:50.667 --> 00:20:52.877 align:middle
I wouldn't give heartfelt
chocolate to my brother.

00:20:52.961 --> 00:20:55.630 align:middle
[KAZAMA]
No, you probably wouldn't.

00:20:58.591 --> 00:20:59.467 align:middle
[KAZAMA]
Thank you.

00:20:59.551 --> 00:21:00.760 align:middle
Huh?

00:21:02.345 --> 00:21:03.972 align:middle
[KAZAMA]
For the chocolate.

00:21:09.936 --> 00:21:11.980 align:middle
Oh! Hey, Kazama!

00:21:13.356 --> 00:21:15.233 align:middle
Here you go,
it's from the chief.

00:21:15.316 --> 00:21:17.360 align:middle
[KAZAMA]
Okay, thanks.

00:21:17.444 --> 00:21:19.237 align:middle
Ah!

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:20.697 align:middle
I'm being dead serious,
you guys!

00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:23.324 align:middle
Kazama had this huge grin
on his face just now!

00:21:23.408 --> 00:21:24.409 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
You're kidding!

00:21:24.492 --> 00:21:25.994 align:middle
I assure you, I'm not!

00:21:26.077 --> 00:21:27.746 align:middle
[HIJIKATA]
Kinda hard to believe.

00:21:27.829 --> 00:21:28.997 align:middle
To smile like that,

00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:31.875 align:middle
I bet something really good
happened to him.

00:21:31.958 --> 00:21:33.835 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Like what?

00:21:33.918 --> 00:21:37.714 align:middle
My guess is maybe someone gave
him some heartfelt chocolate?

00:21:39.090 --> 00:21:40.133 align:middle
Oh, yeah, sure!

00:21:40.216 --> 00:21:41.343 align:middle
Who would do that?

00:21:41.426 --> 00:21:43.470 align:middle
Yeah, like who? There's no one!

00:21:43.553 --> 00:21:45.847 align:middle
[FUTABA] If you want
my opinion, I think it's...

00:21:45.930 --> 00:21:47.640 align:middle
Hey, you guys hungry?

00:21:47.724 --> 00:21:49.976 align:middle
How about we have some
of this cake here?

00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:51.561 align:middle
Someone went through
the trouble of bringing it,

00:21:51.644 --> 00:21:53.980 align:middle
and it looks so delicious!

00:21:54.064 --> 00:21:55.690 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Okay, but who the heck

00:21:55.774 --> 00:21:58.360 align:middle
made this gorgeous
thing, anyway?

00:21:58.443 --> 00:22:00.153 align:middle
[HIJIKATA]
I know, right?

00:22:00.236 --> 00:22:01.738 align:middle
I bet it was the chief.

00:22:01.821 --> 00:22:03.198 align:middle
Huh?!

00:22:03.281 --> 00:22:06.326 align:middle
[TAKEDA] He's always been
a fan of this sort of thing.

00:22:07.619 --> 00:22:11.998 align:middle
[TAKEDA] This year, man,
he really outdid himself.

00:22:12.082 --> 00:22:14.793 align:middle
--Huh?
--Huh?

00:22:14.876 --> 00:22:17.712 align:middle
[SAKURAI, FUTABA]
No way!

00:22:19.005 --> 00:22:21.675 align:middle
[CHIEF]
Hmm?

00:22:21.758 --> 00:22:23.635 align:middle
Happy Valentine's, everyone!
