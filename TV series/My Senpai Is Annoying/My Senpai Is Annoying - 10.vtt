00:00:29.904 --> 00:00:31.698 align:middle
Is something wrong?

00:00:31.781 --> 00:00:33.450 align:middle
Okay, so...

00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:36.578 align:middle
I know you go on morning runs.

00:00:36.661 --> 00:00:40.790 align:middle
It turns out that I really
need to start going with you.

00:00:46.296 --> 00:00:48.006 align:middle
[SAKURAI]
Ow, ow, ow.

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:49.966 align:middle
How does Yuto do
this all the time?

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:51.885 align:middle
Day one and I'm already sore.

00:00:51.968 --> 00:00:52.719 align:middle
[KAZAMA]
Morning, Sakurai.

00:00:52.802 --> 00:00:53.678 align:middle
[gasps]

00:00:53.762 --> 00:00:55.930 align:middle
Oh, hey, good morning!

00:00:56.514 --> 00:00:59.225 align:middle
Uh. Looks like you're
dragging your feet a bit.

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.101 align:middle
Uh...

00:01:00.185 --> 00:01:01.186 align:middle
You feel okay?

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:03.563 align:middle
Oh. Weird.

00:01:03.646 --> 00:01:05.523 align:middle
I actually feel incredible!

00:01:05.607 --> 00:01:07.233 align:middle
So, that's strange.

00:01:07.317 --> 00:01:11.363 align:middle
Heh, heh. Heh-heh-heh, heh heh.

00:01:12.614 --> 00:01:14.032 align:middle
[SAKURAI]
That was close.

00:01:14.115 --> 00:01:17.118 align:middle
I'm way to embarrassed to
tell him I started working out.

00:01:19.287 --> 00:01:21.164 align:middle
Your legs. Do they hurt?

00:01:21.247 --> 00:01:25.085 align:middle
What? No! They feel super.

00:01:25.168 --> 00:01:26.002 align:middle
It's just--

00:01:26.086 --> 00:01:28.046 align:middle
I promise, I'm quite all right.

00:01:30.215 --> 00:01:32.258 align:middle
[TSUKISHIRO] You two
are real buddy-buddy today.

00:01:32.342 --> 00:01:34.636 align:middle
He was only checking up on me.

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:48.817 align:middle
Ah! Hey! What are you doing?

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.903 align:middle
Oo. This area has a great feel.

00:01:51.986 --> 00:01:55.240 align:middle
It's so soft,
I can't stop touching it.

00:01:55.323 --> 00:01:58.284 align:middle
Oh, come on, stop it already!

00:01:58.368 --> 00:02:00.120 align:middle
[TSUKISHIRO]
You're like a plush toy.

00:02:00.704 --> 00:02:02.497 align:middle
Mona!

00:02:12.007 --> 00:02:14.175 align:middle
Kazama, do something!

00:02:15.218 --> 00:02:16.594 align:middle
Huh?

00:02:18.388 --> 00:02:19.973 align:middle
[SAKURAI]
Seriously?

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.201 align:middle
Hey, there.

00:04:03.284 --> 00:04:04.786 align:middle
Is that all you're
having for lunch?

00:04:04.869 --> 00:04:07.747 align:middle
Yeah. I'm going on a new diet.

00:04:07.831 --> 00:04:08.915 align:middle
For real?

00:04:08.998 --> 00:04:11.084 align:middle
Where exactly do you
want to lose weight?

00:04:11.167 --> 00:04:13.294 align:middle
All over, I guess.

00:04:13.378 --> 00:04:14.671 align:middle
[sighs]

00:04:14.754 --> 00:04:17.716 align:middle
I tend to gain weight
around this time every year.

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:19.009 align:middle
Same here.

00:04:19.092 --> 00:04:21.636 align:middle
For some reason,
food tastes better in the fall.

00:04:24.764 --> 00:04:25.682 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Hey, there!

00:04:25.765 --> 00:04:27.225 align:middle
[RAMEN SHOP OWNER]
Welcome!

00:04:27.308 --> 00:04:29.436 align:middle
Oh, Harumi,
good to see you again!

00:04:29.519 --> 00:04:33.773 align:middle
I'm curious, is the promo
on that flyer outside legit?

00:04:33.857 --> 00:04:35.025 align:middle
[RAMEN SHOP OWNER]
Yeah, it is.

00:04:35.108 --> 00:04:37.193 align:middle
I gotta keep spicing things up.

00:04:37.277 --> 00:04:39.279 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Why? Is business bad?

00:04:39.362 --> 00:04:40.613 align:middle
No, sir.

00:04:40.697 --> 00:04:42.741 align:middle
I'm just getting a little
sick of making ramen.

00:04:42.824 --> 00:04:44.325 align:middle
So, what are you gonna do?

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:47.996 align:middle
[RAMEN SHOP OWNER laughs]

00:04:48.079 --> 00:04:49.789 align:middle
I'll make a bunch of pork buns!

00:04:49.873 --> 00:04:52.792 align:middle
Two challengers will come in
and race to finish their plates.

00:04:52.876 --> 00:04:56.129 align:middle
Best part is the
loser foots the bill!

00:04:56.212 --> 00:04:57.630 align:middle
So, you wanna give it a go?

00:04:57.714 --> 00:04:58.798 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Hmm...

00:04:58.882 --> 00:05:00.842 align:middle
But how am I supposed
to "give it a go"?

00:05:00.925 --> 00:05:03.094 align:middle
There's nobody else in here.

00:05:11.019 --> 00:05:13.772 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Huh... She looks familiar.

00:05:13.855 --> 00:05:16.316 align:middle
Oh! It's nice to meet you!

00:05:19.235 --> 00:05:20.612 align:middle
Huh?

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:23.740 align:middle
I would stay away
from that if I were you.

00:05:23.823 --> 00:05:25.533 align:middle
It's a ton of food.

00:05:28.995 --> 00:05:30.038 align:middle
<i>Davai.</i>

00:05:30.121 --> 00:05:31.164 align:middle
[RAMEN SHOP OWNER]
Whoa!

00:05:31.247 --> 00:05:33.124 align:middle
You're a brave soul
to take on Harumi.

00:05:33.208 --> 00:05:34.918 align:middle
Just look at this big lug!

00:05:35.001 --> 00:05:37.295 align:middle
Ah! You could
tell what she said?

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:39.130 align:middle
[RAMEN SHOP OWNER]
Not at all.

00:05:39.214 --> 00:05:40.632 align:middle
Okay then.

00:05:40.715 --> 00:05:44.427 align:middle
I hope both of you came
hungry 'cause it's chow time!

00:05:45.428 --> 00:05:46.805 align:middle
Go!

00:05:58.191 --> 00:05:59.859 align:middle
Oh no.

00:06:03.488 --> 00:06:05.657 align:middle
The filling's too hot.

00:06:07.826 --> 00:06:09.703 align:middle
Guess that makes you the winner.

00:06:09.786 --> 00:06:12.122 align:middle
[TAKEDA] Wait,
we speak the same language?

00:06:21.214 --> 00:06:23.717 align:middle
I didn't know there was
a basketball court here.

00:06:28.054 --> 00:06:30.098 align:middle
Whoa! Kazama!

00:06:30.181 --> 00:06:31.933 align:middle
Heard you joined
basketball club.

00:06:32.017 --> 00:06:35.478 align:middle
Yup, you heard right, and
it's been pretty fun so far!

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:38.273 align:middle
What is it that you're
working on right now?

00:06:38.356 --> 00:06:41.109 align:middle
[YUTO] I really want to
learn how to shoot a basket.

00:06:41.192 --> 00:06:43.945 align:middle
But I haven't made
a single one yet.

00:06:44.029 --> 00:06:46.531 align:middle
[KAZAMA] I can give you
some pointers if you want.

00:06:46.614 --> 00:06:49.325 align:middle
Wait a sec, you know
how to play basketball?

00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:52.954 align:middle
Yeah. I used to play a lot.

00:07:06.551 --> 00:07:08.178 align:middle
It didn't even touch the rim.

00:07:08.261 --> 00:07:10.013 align:middle
I haven't done that in a while.

00:07:10.096 --> 00:07:12.182 align:middle
Hey, if you focus on
throwing the ball higher

00:07:12.265 --> 00:07:13.600 align:middle
that should help.

00:07:13.683 --> 00:07:15.018 align:middle
I think.

00:07:17.854 --> 00:07:20.982 align:middle
If you practice hard
enough, you'll get it.

00:07:21.066 --> 00:07:24.903 align:middle
This time,
try copying what I did.

00:07:26.446 --> 00:07:29.074 align:middle
Yeah, I can do that!

00:07:29.157 --> 00:07:30.575 align:middle
Try to lower your hips

00:07:30.658 --> 00:07:33.119 align:middle
and think about the power
shooting out your fingertips.

00:07:33.203 --> 00:07:33.953 align:middle
Make sense?

00:07:34.037 --> 00:07:35.330 align:middle
I think I get it.

00:07:35.413 --> 00:07:37.499 align:middle
Now, let your left
hand act as a guide.

00:07:37.582 --> 00:07:41.086 align:middle
Oh, yeah, one of the guys
in the club told me that.

00:07:42.462 --> 00:07:44.005 align:middle
I can do it.

00:07:49.386 --> 00:07:50.470 align:middle
Ah!

00:07:51.221 --> 00:07:52.722 align:middle
[SAKURAI]
Hey, Kazama!

00:07:52.806 --> 00:07:55.725 align:middle
Yuto told me you gave him some
basketball tips the other day.

00:07:55.809 --> 00:07:58.395 align:middle
It seems like he had
a really wonderful time.

00:07:58.478 --> 00:07:59.562 align:middle
[KAZAMA]
Yeah.

00:07:59.646 --> 00:08:01.856 align:middle
I promised him we could
do it again soon.

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:02.982 align:middle
[SAKURAI]
Really?

00:08:03.066 --> 00:08:05.443 align:middle
Could I come watch you guys?

00:08:05.527 --> 00:08:07.487 align:middle
Uh, I guess so.

00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:09.197 align:middle
It might be kinda boring

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:11.116 align:middle
No way, I'm sure it'll be fun.

00:08:11.199 --> 00:08:12.701 align:middle
I could make some rice balls.

00:08:12.784 --> 00:08:13.910 align:middle
I would like that.

00:08:13.993 --> 00:08:15.036 align:middle
[giggles]

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:16.162 align:middle
Cool!

00:08:17.831 --> 00:08:19.207 align:middle
Bye.

00:08:25.005 --> 00:08:26.631 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Let's grab something to eat.

00:08:26.715 --> 00:08:28.133 align:middle
Okay, how about pizza?

00:08:28.216 --> 00:08:29.926 align:middle
We could try that place
in front of the station.

00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:32.846 align:middle
Yeah. Sounds good!

00:08:32.929 --> 00:08:35.306 align:middle
Oh. Hey, it's you!

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:36.474 align:middle
[TSUKISHIRO]
Hmm?

00:08:36.558 --> 00:08:37.976 align:middle
Hi.

00:08:38.059 --> 00:08:40.228 align:middle
By the way, thank you for
helping me out the other day.

00:08:40.311 --> 00:08:41.438 align:middle
Not a problem.

00:08:41.521 --> 00:08:43.440 align:middle
I actually ended up
having a lot of fun.

00:08:43.523 --> 00:08:44.482 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Huh?

00:08:44.566 --> 00:08:46.651 align:middle
We ran into
each other at Itomaki.

00:08:46.735 --> 00:08:49.487 align:middle
He helped me finish
off an order of pork buns.

00:08:49.571 --> 00:08:50.613 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Ohh...

00:08:50.697 --> 00:08:52.365 align:middle
I gotta ask,
why did you order those

00:08:52.449 --> 00:08:54.117 align:middle
if you know you
don't like hot food?

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.952 align:middle
I bought them at a
convenience store once

00:08:56.036 --> 00:08:57.579 align:middle
and they were served cold so...

00:08:57.662 --> 00:09:00.081 align:middle
[TAKEDA] I bet they were
the microwaveable kind.

00:09:00.165 --> 00:09:01.416 align:middle
[TSUKISHIRO]
I had no clue.

00:09:01.499 --> 00:09:03.752 align:middle
[TAKEDA laughs] You're
a strange one, aren't you?

00:09:03.835 --> 00:09:05.545 align:middle
[TSUKISHIRO]
Surprisingly, I get that a lot,

00:09:05.628 --> 00:09:08.590 align:middle
but I'm not sure what
people are referring to.

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:13.345 align:middle
Well, if you'll excuse me,

00:09:13.428 --> 00:09:15.180 align:middle
I was about to
head out with Touko.

00:09:15.263 --> 00:09:16.723 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
See ya.

00:09:19.851 --> 00:09:22.020 align:middle
Right, it's time for you
and me to get some grub.

00:09:22.103 --> 00:09:23.438 align:middle
Oh. Okay.

00:09:26.149 --> 00:09:27.984 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Hmmm...

00:09:28.068 --> 00:09:29.277 align:middle
Hey, Igarashi.

00:09:29.361 --> 00:09:31.488 align:middle
What? Is something the matter?

00:09:31.571 --> 00:09:33.156 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Actually, let's go to Itomaki.

00:09:33.239 --> 00:09:35.575 align:middle
Huh? Why though?

00:09:35.658 --> 00:09:38.661 align:middle
[TAKEDA] Because you look like
a girl who needs some pork buns.

00:09:39.913 --> 00:09:42.123 align:middle
You really can't hide
your facial expressions.

00:09:42.207 --> 00:09:43.708 align:middle
It's helpful.

00:09:54.803 --> 00:09:56.554 align:middle
What gives?

00:10:02.936 --> 00:10:03.812 align:middle
Thanks for your help.

00:10:03.895 --> 00:10:05.105 align:middle
I appreciate it.

00:10:05.188 --> 00:10:06.231 align:middle
No prob.

00:10:06.314 --> 00:10:08.566 align:middle
I really like cooking,
so I don't mind.

00:10:12.362 --> 00:10:15.198 align:middle
[SAKURAI] Man. I can't quite
make them triangular.

00:10:15.281 --> 00:10:16.825 align:middle
C'mon, don't worry about that.

00:10:16.908 --> 00:10:18.785 align:middle
They look cuter
when they're round.

00:10:18.868 --> 00:10:19.786 align:middle
Think so?

00:10:19.869 --> 00:10:21.079 align:middle
[YUTO]
Mm-hmm.

00:10:23.248 --> 00:10:24.541 align:middle
[KAZAMA]
Yeah, that's it.

00:10:24.624 --> 00:10:27.210 align:middle
Imagine the ball is being
sucked into your palm.

00:10:27.293 --> 00:10:28.545 align:middle
Right!

00:10:30.588 --> 00:10:32.257 align:middle
Hey, ballers!

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:35.051 align:middle
Want to take a
break for lunch soon?

00:10:36.636 --> 00:10:37.929 align:middle
[ALL 3]
Let's eat!

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:41.391 align:middle
Yum.

00:10:41.474 --> 00:10:42.767 align:middle
I'm glad you like it.

00:10:42.851 --> 00:10:44.227 align:middle
We have a lot more.

00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:45.603 align:middle
Thanks for coaching me today.

00:10:45.687 --> 00:10:46.771 align:middle
I learned a bunch.

00:10:46.855 --> 00:10:48.273 align:middle
It wasn't a problem at all.

00:10:48.356 --> 00:10:51.151 align:middle
I got in some really
good exercise.

00:10:51.234 --> 00:10:52.068 align:middle
It's just--

00:10:52.152 --> 00:10:53.445 align:middle
Just what?

00:10:53.528 --> 00:10:57.615 align:middle
Well, I invited Hijikata and
the guys to come play,

00:10:57.699 --> 00:11:01.286 align:middle
but it seemed like everyone
had something better to do.

00:11:02.704 --> 00:11:05.165 align:middle
Aw, that's a shame.

00:11:08.084 --> 00:11:09.419 align:middle
It's been great,

00:11:09.502 --> 00:11:12.964 align:middle
but it might be even better
with a few more players.

00:11:13.048 --> 00:11:14.299 align:middle
Good news!

00:11:15.884 --> 00:11:16.634 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Hey, hey!

00:11:16.718 --> 00:11:17.969 align:middle
[FUTABA]
There you are.

00:11:18.053 --> 00:11:19.471 align:middle
[NATSUMI]
Looks like a party!

00:11:19.554 --> 00:11:21.806 align:middle
Whoa. So many friendly faces!

00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:25.185 align:middle
Oops. Forgot to mention
Kazama and Sakurai'd be here.

00:11:25.268 --> 00:11:27.854 align:middle
Hi guys, what are you all up to?

00:11:27.937 --> 00:11:29.689 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Kurobe invited us to come play.

00:11:29.773 --> 00:11:31.524 align:middle
[NATSUMI]
I figured the more the merrier.

00:11:31.608 --> 00:11:33.943 align:middle
Yeah, for sure!

00:11:34.027 --> 00:11:35.195 align:middle
Oh, basketball.

00:11:35.278 --> 00:11:36.571 align:middle
So many memories.

00:11:36.654 --> 00:11:37.447 align:middle
I believe it.

00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:39.324 align:middle
You look like you can dunk.

00:11:39.407 --> 00:11:40.408 align:middle
Thank you.

00:11:40.492 --> 00:11:42.577 align:middle
I'm glad you all came today!

00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:44.496 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Anytime, kiddo.

00:11:44.579 --> 00:11:45.622 align:middle
Game on, guys!

00:11:45.705 --> 00:11:46.956 align:middle
[ALL 4]
Yeah!

00:11:48.166 --> 00:11:50.585 align:middle
Look, Yuto saved the day.

00:11:50.669 --> 00:11:52.003 align:middle
Hmm?

00:11:53.129 --> 00:11:55.590 align:middle
[KAZAMA]
Sakurai?

00:11:58.802 --> 00:12:02.597 align:middle
[FUTABA, YUTO] We'll make two
teams, one paper and one rock!

00:12:03.014 --> 00:12:07.852 align:middle
[All 5]
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

00:12:11.272 --> 00:12:12.273 align:middle
Heya, teammate!

00:12:12.357 --> 00:12:13.525 align:middle
Hey.

00:12:13.608 --> 00:12:15.777 align:middle
Are you not going
to play with us, Sakurai?

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:18.196 align:middle
Um, I'm a little bit sore.

00:12:18.279 --> 00:12:19.823 align:middle
I can be the ref.

00:12:19.906 --> 00:12:20.782 align:middle
[KAZAMA]
Hmm?

00:12:20.865 --> 00:12:22.325 align:middle
So, you were sore.

00:12:22.409 --> 00:12:24.035 align:middle
[gasps]

00:12:24.119 --> 00:12:26.413 align:middle
Get your head in
the game, everybody!

00:12:26.496 --> 00:12:29.207 align:middle
The first team
to five baskets wins.

00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:31.418 align:middle
I'm ready to
shoot me some hoops!

00:12:31.501 --> 00:12:33.253 align:middle
No holding back!

00:12:48.268 --> 00:12:49.269 align:middle
Hyaah!

00:12:49.352 --> 00:12:51.730 align:middle
[FUTABA screams]
Too tall!

00:12:51.813 --> 00:12:52.897 align:middle
Yuto, catch!

00:12:52.981 --> 00:12:54.190 align:middle
[YUTO]
He--!

00:12:55.608 --> 00:12:57.610 align:middle
Oh, come on!

00:12:58.862 --> 00:13:00.030 align:middle
[KAZAMA]
She's a girl.

00:13:00.113 --> 00:13:03.450 align:middle
That means,
I shouldn't play too rough.

00:13:18.423 --> 00:13:20.050 align:middle
Whoa! Nice!

00:13:20.133 --> 00:13:21.676 align:middle
Heh heh heh.

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:25.096 align:middle
My pal Natsumi was the best
basketball player in school!

00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:26.431 align:middle
[YUTO]
So cool.

00:13:26.514 --> 00:13:28.433 align:middle
Your nose is bleeding!

00:13:30.935 --> 00:13:32.562 align:middle
Just luck.

00:13:39.194 --> 00:13:42.155 align:middle
Now it's our team's
time to shine!

00:13:42.238 --> 00:13:44.824 align:middle
Whatcha' gonna do, Igarashi?

00:13:46.242 --> 00:13:47.452 align:middle
Don't smoosh me!

00:13:47.535 --> 00:13:48.912 align:middle
Gyahh!

00:13:56.086 --> 00:13:58.088 align:middle
[YUTO]
I can handle this!

00:14:03.802 --> 00:14:06.554 align:middle
[laughs]
Good job, me!

00:14:06.638 --> 00:14:07.555 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Hey, no fair.

00:14:07.639 --> 00:14:09.224 align:middle
You're a giant!

00:14:12.811 --> 00:14:15.021 align:middle
[YUTO]
I want to make cool shots, too.

00:14:15.105 --> 00:14:17.524 align:middle
I'm the one in
the basketball club.

00:14:17.607 --> 00:14:18.983 align:middle
[NATSUMI]
Don't be nervous.

00:14:19.067 --> 00:14:21.861 align:middle
If you need help, your
teammates have got your back.

00:14:23.279 --> 00:14:24.280 align:middle
Right!

00:14:31.955 --> 00:14:33.331 align:middle
[YUTO]
Kazama.

00:14:36.376 --> 00:14:38.795 align:middle
[YUTO]
No way I can get past him.

00:14:38.878 --> 00:14:41.756 align:middle
Still...

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:43.425 align:middle
I've gotta try!

00:14:46.011 --> 00:14:47.262 align:middle
Huh?

00:14:52.058 --> 00:14:53.685 align:middle
I made it!

00:15:03.611 --> 00:15:05.196 align:middle
[SAKURAI]
Yuto!

00:15:11.119 --> 00:15:13.788 align:middle
And with that basket,
Team Kazama takes the lead!

00:15:13.872 --> 00:15:15.874 align:middle
Now, the ball goes
to Team Natsumi.

00:15:15.957 --> 00:15:17.459 align:middle
Go get 'em!

00:15:17.542 --> 00:15:19.502 align:middle
I'm way too stubborn
to let you win.

00:15:19.586 --> 00:15:20.628 align:middle
Okay, then.

00:15:20.712 --> 00:15:22.922 align:middle
Gimme your worst!

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:26.217 align:middle
Could you please just
crouch down or something?

00:15:26.301 --> 00:15:29.512 align:middle
You're too big.

00:15:29.596 --> 00:15:31.931 align:middle
I guess that's fair.

00:15:32.015 --> 00:15:33.266 align:middle
Huh?

00:15:35.101 --> 00:15:37.103 align:middle
You fell right into my trap.

00:15:37.312 --> 00:15:39.606 align:middle
--She shoots!
--You're such a little liar!

00:16:14.891 --> 00:16:16.101 align:middle
[NATSUMI]
Here he comes!

00:16:18.144 --> 00:16:19.479 align:middle
He's fast!

00:16:26.778 --> 00:16:27.987 align:middle
Not too shabby!

00:16:28.071 --> 00:16:30.407 align:middle
I never would've
guessed he's so athletic.

00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:32.242 align:middle
Awesome!

00:16:33.368 --> 00:16:38.665 align:middle
[sighs] Be honest, before now,
were you going easy on me?

00:16:38.748 --> 00:16:40.166 align:middle
I was being careful.

00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:42.711 align:middle
I would feel bad
if I hurt a girl.

00:16:44.004 --> 00:16:46.047 align:middle
Well, the game isn't over yet.

00:16:46.131 --> 00:16:47.882 align:middle
Let's keep playing, shall we?

00:16:47.966 --> 00:16:51.011 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Uh... She did not like that.

00:16:55.557 --> 00:16:57.183 align:middle
Check this out.

00:17:08.486 --> 00:17:10.030 align:middle
[NATSUMI]
Last resort.

00:17:13.783 --> 00:17:16.703 align:middle
[blows whistle]

00:17:21.583 --> 00:17:24.252 align:middle
You'd better stay on your toes.

00:17:29.924 --> 00:17:31.343 align:middle
Just quit!

00:17:31.426 --> 00:17:34.471 align:middle
This is supposed to be a
practice for Yuto, not you two!

00:17:34.554 --> 00:17:36.348 align:middle
Sorry about that.

00:17:36.723 --> 00:17:38.058 align:middle
Oh, I didn't mind.

00:17:38.141 --> 00:17:40.643 align:middle
I learned quite a bit just
from watching you play!

00:17:40.727 --> 00:17:43.855 align:middle
Igarashi and I had
a great time today, as well,

00:17:43.938 --> 00:17:45.440 align:middle
but now,

00:17:45.523 --> 00:17:48.693 align:middle
It looks like someone's
all out of juice.

00:17:48.777 --> 00:17:50.320 align:middle
You ready to call it a day?

00:17:50.403 --> 00:17:51.196 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Yeah.

00:17:51.279 --> 00:17:52.947 align:middle
I might go hit a bathhouse.

00:17:53.031 --> 00:17:54.240 align:middle
That's a good idea.

00:17:54.324 --> 00:17:56.451 align:middle
I need a shower,
like, right now.

00:17:56.534 --> 00:17:58.578 align:middle
I am drenched in sweat.

00:17:58.661 --> 00:18:00.914 align:middle
I gotta get going,
but we should do this again.

00:18:00.997 --> 00:18:01.956 align:middle
Don't you think?

00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:03.041 align:middle
[YUTO]
For sure!

00:18:03.124 --> 00:18:05.669 align:middle
Thanks so much for coming today!

00:18:09.255 --> 00:18:10.632 align:middle
No way, Kazama.

00:18:10.715 --> 00:18:12.842 align:middle
You can't leave.
You're coming with me.

00:18:12.926 --> 00:18:14.052 align:middle
Huh?

00:18:14.135 --> 00:18:18.264 align:middle
Come on! We barely
spent any time together!

00:18:18.348 --> 00:18:20.225 align:middle
Huh?

00:18:20.308 --> 00:18:22.977 align:middle
Yuto can come hang out with us.

00:18:23.061 --> 00:18:25.271 align:middle
It'll be fun, let's go.

00:18:34.781 --> 00:18:37.325 align:middle
Do you wanna
get something to eat?

00:18:37.409 --> 00:18:38.868 align:middle
[SAKURAI]
Hmm?

00:18:40.954 --> 00:18:42.539 align:middle
[SAKURAI]
Sure.

00:18:46.126 --> 00:18:48.545 align:middle
Ah, we finally made it.

00:18:51.131 --> 00:18:53.049 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Hey. You awake?

00:18:54.926 --> 00:18:56.261 align:middle
Huh?! What?!

00:18:56.344 --> 00:18:58.555 align:middle
Why are you carrying me?

00:18:58.638 --> 00:19:01.099 align:middle
You ran out of steam
at the basketball court.

00:19:01.182 --> 00:19:02.809 align:middle
Very preschool of you.

00:19:02.892 --> 00:19:04.310 align:middle
I wasn't talking to you!

00:19:04.394 --> 00:19:05.270 align:middle
Calm down.

00:19:05.353 --> 00:19:06.855 align:middle
We just got to the bathhouse.

00:19:06.938 --> 00:19:07.772 align:middle
[gasps]

00:19:07.856 --> 00:19:09.190 align:middle
Is it a mixed bath?

00:19:09.274 --> 00:19:10.984 align:middle
[NATSUMI]
Hell no.

00:19:13.028 --> 00:19:16.531 align:middle
Ahhh... It just doesn't
get better than this.

00:19:16.614 --> 00:19:17.866 align:middle
You dork.

00:19:17.949 --> 00:19:20.368 align:middle
You sound like a grandma.

00:19:20.452 --> 00:19:22.370 align:middle
Too bad you didn't get
to bathe with Takeda.

00:19:22.454 --> 00:19:23.830 align:middle
I bet you're crushed.

00:19:24.789 --> 00:19:27.208 align:middle
[FUTABA] You know that's
the last thing I would want!

00:19:27.292 --> 00:19:29.961 align:middle
[NATSUMI]
Hmm?

00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:32.172 align:middle
What?

00:19:32.255 --> 00:19:35.842 align:middle
[NATSUMI] You haven't changed at
all since junior high, have you?

00:19:35.925 --> 00:19:37.344 align:middle
Huh?!

00:19:37.427 --> 00:19:40.680 align:middle
I'm not sure, but I think
you're still the same height.

00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:44.726 align:middle
[NATSUMI]
I didn't mean it in a bad way!

00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:48.104 align:middle
It feels so nice to bathe

00:19:48.188 --> 00:19:51.107 align:middle
and stretch your legs
at the same time.

00:19:51.191 --> 00:19:53.526 align:middle
[YUTO] I'm sure that's
especially true for him.

00:19:53.610 --> 00:19:55.737 align:middle
He is pretty massive.

00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:56.988 align:middle
Hey, Takeda?

00:19:57.072 --> 00:19:58.281 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Hmm?

00:19:58.365 --> 00:20:01.284 align:middle
[YUTO] What can I do
to get as big as you are?

00:20:01.368 --> 00:20:02.911 align:middle
To get big?

00:20:02.994 --> 00:20:04.579 align:middle
Well, in my case.

00:20:04.662 --> 00:20:08.041 align:middle
I ate a lot of tasty food and
made sure to always get sleep.

00:20:08.124 --> 00:20:11.086 align:middle
[YUTO]
I see. Diet and rest.

00:20:11.169 --> 00:20:13.338 align:middle
If you aren't too picky
about the stuff you eat.

00:20:13.421 --> 00:20:16.508 align:middle
You'll get big in no time.

00:20:20.345 --> 00:20:23.014 align:middle
Oh, and most importantly,
drink your milk!

00:20:23.098 --> 00:20:24.641 align:middle
Really, milk?

00:20:24.724 --> 00:20:26.518 align:middle
Yeah, do you drink it much?

00:20:26.601 --> 00:20:27.560 align:middle
[YUTO]
My sister does.

00:20:27.644 --> 00:20:30.480 align:middle
She really likes it, but I--

00:20:30.563 --> 00:20:32.649 align:middle
Milk can strengthen your bones.

00:20:32.732 --> 00:20:35.527 align:middle
It's perfect for a
young basketball player.

00:20:42.409 --> 00:20:43.159 align:middle
[KAZAMA]
Here.

00:20:43.243 --> 00:20:44.327 align:middle
Thank you.

00:20:44.411 --> 00:20:47.288 align:middle
Wow, this brings back memories.

00:20:47.372 --> 00:20:50.500 align:middle
It's okay to eat like
this sometimes, y'know.

00:20:59.259 --> 00:21:00.552 align:middle
It's okay...

00:21:00.635 --> 00:21:02.762 align:middle
...to be selfish, too.

00:21:02.846 --> 00:21:03.805 align:middle
Huh?

00:21:03.888 --> 00:21:06.266 align:middle
[SAKURAI]
Oh! It's nothing!

00:21:08.143 --> 00:21:09.644 align:middle
Do you not put ketchup on yours?

00:21:09.728 --> 00:21:11.396 align:middle
[KAZAMA]
Oh. Guess I forgot.

00:21:11.479 --> 00:21:13.732 align:middle
[SAKURAI]
You can't forget the ketchup!

00:21:18.611 --> 00:21:19.738 align:middle
Have this.

00:21:19.821 --> 00:21:21.281 align:middle
[YUTO]
Okay, thank you.

00:21:21.364 --> 00:21:24.659 align:middle
--Hey!
--We're drink twins!

00:21:24.743 --> 00:21:28.413 align:middle
[FUTABA] Nothing beats the
taste of some post-bath milk.

00:21:28.496 --> 00:21:30.623 align:middle
Igarashi!

00:21:30.707 --> 00:21:32.042 align:middle
You should really
drink milk every day

00:21:32.125 --> 00:21:34.961 align:middle
so that you can get taller!

00:21:35.045 --> 00:21:36.129 align:middle
I already do.

00:21:36.212 --> 00:21:37.630 align:middle
Every single day.

00:21:39.841 --> 00:21:41.051 align:middle
[YUTO]
Oh, also.

00:21:41.134 --> 00:21:43.178 align:middle
Takeda taught me
that diet and rest
