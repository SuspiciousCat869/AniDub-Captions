Mm.

00:11:46.539 --> 00:11:48.875 align:middle
You have a Happy New Year, too.

00:11:52.504 --> 00:11:54.339 align:middle
Wow, this place is crowded.

00:11:54.422 --> 00:11:56.257 align:middle
It is New Year's Day.

00:11:58.301 --> 00:12:00.136 align:middle
Huh? Uh...

00:12:01.429 --> 00:12:02.472 align:middle
[NATSUMI]
Hmm?

00:12:06.101 --> 00:12:07.811 align:middle
Takeda!

00:12:07.894 --> 00:12:09.521 align:middle
Natsumi, wait!

00:12:09.979 --> 00:12:12.482 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Hmm? Oh, hi!

00:12:12.565 --> 00:12:14.067 align:middle
First visit of the year?

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:15.318 align:middle
Uh-huh.

00:12:15.402 --> 00:12:18.113 align:middle
I thought I'd stop by
on my way to get ramen.

00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:20.031 align:middle
Look who it is!

00:12:20.115 --> 00:12:22.409 align:middle
Hello, um,

00:12:22.492 --> 00:12:25.120 align:middle
I hope you're having
a Happy New Year so far.

00:12:25.203 --> 00:12:25.995 align:middle
Thanks!

00:12:26.079 --> 00:12:28.206 align:middle
I hope you have been, too!

00:12:28.289 --> 00:12:29.416 align:middle
Heh.

00:12:29.499 --> 00:12:30.709 align:middle
Oh, darn it!

00:12:30.792 --> 00:12:32.210 align:middle
I just remembered that I have

00:12:32.293 --> 00:12:35.130 align:middle
some really important business
on the other side of town!

00:12:35.213 --> 00:12:38.299 align:middle
It stinks, but I don't
think I can get out of it.

00:12:38.383 --> 00:12:40.385 align:middle
I'd better be on my way!

00:12:40.468 --> 00:12:41.636 align:middle
Huh?!

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:43.388 align:middle
You two have fun now!

00:12:43.471 --> 00:12:44.889 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Natsumi?!

00:12:45.849 --> 00:12:48.601 align:middle
One day into the year,
and she's already busy.

00:12:52.105 --> 00:12:53.356 align:middle
You wore a kimono?

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:54.607 align:middle
Uh.

00:12:54.691 --> 00:12:57.569 align:middle
I wanted to dress up
for New Year's.

00:12:57.652 --> 00:12:59.320 align:middle
Looks good.

00:13:01.239 --> 00:13:04.159 align:middle
Would you like to do your
first shrine visit with me?

00:13:04.242 --> 00:13:05.660 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Sure.

00:13:11.249 --> 00:13:12.542 align:middle
[FUTABA]
O powerful spirit,

00:13:12.625 --> 00:13:14.753 align:middle
please help me land
more contracts.

00:13:14.836 --> 00:13:16.838 align:middle
Also, make my boobs bigger,

00:13:16.921 --> 00:13:18.840 align:middle
but still
proportionate to my body.

00:13:18.923 --> 00:13:20.675 align:middle
And maybe...

00:13:24.554 --> 00:13:25.513 align:middle
Takeda?

00:13:25.597 --> 00:13:27.140 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Hmm?

00:13:27.223 --> 00:13:31.269 align:middle
I hope this year is the
greatest one you've ever had.

00:13:33.104 --> 00:13:34.898 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Right back at ya'.

00:13:39.235 --> 00:13:41.654 align:middle
Oh! Let's get our
fortunes for the year.

00:13:41.738 --> 00:13:43.782 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Oo, good idea!

00:13:43.865 --> 00:13:46.785 align:middle
Last year, I was lucky enough
to draw a <i>chuukichi</i> .

00:13:46.868 --> 00:13:49.496 align:middle
[chuckles]
Nice, but mine was a <i>kichi</i> .

00:13:49.579 --> 00:13:51.623 align:middle
Yeah? Could've be worse.

00:13:51.706 --> 00:13:55.418 align:middle
Huh? <i>Kichi</i> is the best option
after <i>daikichi</i> , isn't it?

00:13:55.502 --> 00:13:57.879 align:middle
Huh? I don't think so.

00:13:57.962 --> 00:14:02.509 align:middle
The order goes, <i>daikichi</i> ,
<i>chuukichi</i> , <i>shoukichi</i> , <i>kichi</i> ,

00:14:02.592 --> 00:14:04.552 align:middle
doesn't it?

00:14:04.636 --> 00:14:08.723 align:middle
Huh? No way, it definitely goes,
<i>daikichi</i> , <i>kichi</i> , <i>chuukichi</i> ,

00:14:08.807 --> 00:14:10.016 align:middle
so <i>kichi</i> wins.

00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:12.894 align:middle
Uh... I'm sure
<i>chuukichi</i> 's better!

00:14:12.977 --> 00:14:15.438 align:middle
And I'm sure you're wrong!

00:14:15.522 --> 00:14:19.150 align:middle
Well, why don't we just see who
gets the better fortune today?

00:14:19.234 --> 00:14:20.235 align:middle
Regardless of what happens,

00:14:20.318 --> 00:14:21.736 align:middle
no hard feelings, 'kay?

00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:22.737 align:middle
Yeah.

00:14:22.821 --> 00:14:24.823 align:middle
[MAN A]
Whoa! This lady's amazing!

00:14:24.906 --> 00:14:26.491 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Huh?

00:14:26.574 --> 00:14:28.535 align:middle
Is that Mona?

00:14:28.618 --> 00:14:30.078 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Uh-huh.

00:14:31.913 --> 00:14:33.289 align:middle
--Ohh!
--Ohh!

00:14:33.373 --> 00:14:34.416 align:middle
[MAN A]
How's it possible?

00:14:34.499 --> 00:14:36.876 align:middle
She drew another <i>daikichi</i> !

00:14:38.294 --> 00:14:40.046 align:middle
This will be one, too.

00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:42.549 align:middle
So... you can read it and weep.

00:14:43.883 --> 00:14:45.510 align:middle
How has she drawn
one every single time?

00:14:45.593 --> 00:14:47.387 align:middle
So cool!

00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:50.056 align:middle
A very Happy New Year
to you all!

00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:51.224 align:middle
[MAN A]
They're all <i>daikichi</i> !

00:14:51.307 --> 00:14:52.475 align:middle
[WOMAN B]
I need you to draw mine, too!

00:14:52.559 --> 00:14:53.852 align:middle
Pretty please!

00:14:56.146 --> 00:14:56.896 align:middle
Whoa!

00:14:56.980 --> 00:14:58.398 align:middle
How interesting.

00:14:58.481 --> 00:15:01.067 align:middle
<i>Daikichi</i> must be more
common at this shrine.

00:15:01.151 --> 00:15:02.193 align:middle
We can find out!

00:15:02.277 --> 00:15:03.820 align:middle
Right.

00:15:07.866 --> 00:15:09.200 align:middle
[FUTABA, TAKEDA]
Fortune, please.

00:15:09.284 --> 00:15:12.620 align:middle
Sure! Here you are.

00:15:12.704 --> 00:15:13.955 align:middle
Thank you.

00:15:26.468 --> 00:15:28.011 align:middle
--So, what is it?
--So, what does yours say?

00:15:28.094 --> 00:15:30.096 align:middle
--Nothing
--Oh, nothing

00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:32.515 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Let's tie 'em up and leave.

00:15:32.599 --> 00:15:33.933 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Okay.

00:15:36.102 --> 00:15:38.813 align:middle
[TAKEDA] They just provide a
false sense of security, anyway.

00:15:38.897 --> 00:15:40.315 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Exactly.

00:15:46.154 --> 00:15:47.238 align:middle
[RAMEN SHOP OWNER]
Here ya go!

00:15:47.322 --> 00:15:49.783 align:middle
A big 'ole helping of
New Year's ramen!

00:15:50.658 --> 00:15:53.161 align:middle
What makes this different
from his usual ramen?

00:15:53.244 --> 00:15:55.288 align:middle
It has a few more
slices of fish cake.

00:15:55.372 --> 00:15:59.167 align:middle
Oh, I guess that does make it
a little bit more festive.

00:15:59.250 --> 00:16:00.752 align:middle
Agreed.

00:16:00.835 --> 00:16:02.170 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Let's dig in.

00:16:02.253 --> 00:16:03.338 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Yeah!

00:16:03.421 --> 00:16:06.299 align:middle
[noodles slurping]

00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:11.554 align:middle
You know, we drew
some pretty unlucky fortunes

00:16:11.638 --> 00:16:13.014 align:middle
this time around.

00:16:13.098 --> 00:16:14.974 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
For sure.

00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:19.229 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Now that we're on the topic--

00:16:19.312 --> 00:16:20.563 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Hmm?

00:16:20.647 --> 00:16:22.774 align:middle
What exactly
did yours say, again?

00:16:22.857 --> 00:16:25.276 align:middle
I'll admit, I'm kinda curious.

00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:28.738 align:middle
Uh...

00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:33.368 align:middle
Nothing new.

00:16:33.451 --> 00:16:34.953 align:middle
The average stuff.

00:16:35.036 --> 00:16:35.954 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Hmm?

00:16:36.037 --> 00:16:38.248 align:middle
Are you hiding
something from me?

00:16:38.873 --> 00:16:41.084 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Uh, well, what did yours say?

00:16:41.167 --> 00:16:45.588 align:middle
Uh! So, uh, mine had all
the usual kind of things.

00:16:45.672 --> 00:16:48.216 align:middle
Wait, are you hiding
something from me, too?

00:16:48.299 --> 00:16:50.010 align:middle
Huh? You just said "too"!

00:16:50.093 --> 00:16:51.970 align:middle
Then you admit that you're
hiding something from me!

00:16:52.053 --> 00:16:54.097 align:middle
And obviously, so are you!

00:16:57.308 --> 00:16:59.060 align:middle
We should drop this.

00:16:59.144 --> 00:17:00.645 align:middle
There's no need
to get worked up.

00:17:00.729 --> 00:17:01.855 align:middle
Those things are random.

00:17:01.938 --> 00:17:04.524 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Hmm... You're right.

00:17:04.607 --> 00:17:06.901 align:middle
I guess that's true.

00:17:08.111 --> 00:17:10.113 align:middle
Now, let's check in
live at the scene.

00:17:10.196 --> 00:17:12.032 align:middle
Suzuki, you there?

00:17:12.157 --> 00:17:13.616 align:middle
[REPORTER] Hello!
I'm coming to you today

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:16.661 align:middle
from the Itomaki Shrine.

00:17:16.745 --> 00:17:17.996 align:middle
Get this.

00:17:18.079 --> 00:17:19.414 align:middle
I found a couple who went
on a date to the shrine

00:17:19.497 --> 00:17:22.709 align:middle
so they could share
this year's first visit!

00:17:22.792 --> 00:17:24.210 align:middle
Tell us more!

00:17:26.796 --> 00:17:29.174 align:middle
[KAZAMA]
Um, this isn't really a date.

00:17:29.257 --> 00:17:31.468 align:middle
[SAKURAI]
Yeah, we were just hanging out.

00:17:31.551 --> 00:17:33.511 align:middle
[REPORTER]
Oh, I see.

00:17:33.595 --> 00:17:36.264 align:middle
So, how has the shrine been?

00:17:36.348 --> 00:17:37.432 align:middle
Kinda weird.

00:17:37.515 --> 00:17:39.434 align:middle
We saw our co-workers
here a while ago.

00:17:39.517 --> 00:17:41.561 align:middle
But we decided
that we shouldn't say hi.

00:17:41.644 --> 00:17:43.980 align:middle
It felt rude to disturb them.

00:17:44.064 --> 00:17:46.441 align:middle
[REPORTER]
Were your co-workers on a date?

00:17:46.524 --> 00:17:49.110 align:middle
I don't know if you'd
really call it that,

00:17:49.194 --> 00:17:52.113 align:middle
but the two of them
are definitely close.

00:17:52.197 --> 00:17:55.742 align:middle
At first, things were
pretty tense between them.

00:17:55.825 --> 00:17:57.786 align:middle
Eat up. It'll get cold.

00:17:57.869 --> 00:17:59.537 align:middle
Oh, right!

00:17:59.621 --> 00:18:01.581 align:middle
[REPORTER]
How's their relationship now?

00:18:01.664 --> 00:18:04.042 align:middle
[KAZAMA]
Hm. This picture can explain it.

00:18:04.125 --> 00:18:06.628 align:middle
Wait a sec, are they
father and daughter?

00:18:06.711 --> 00:18:09.089 align:middle
Aw! She's asleep on his arm!

00:18:09.172 --> 00:18:11.716 align:middle
That's so cute!

00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:14.052 align:middle
All of us were on a train,
and she dozed off,

00:18:14.135 --> 00:18:15.220 align:middle
right on his shoulder.

00:18:15.303 --> 00:18:17.555 align:middle
If she sees this, you're dead.

00:18:17.639 --> 00:18:18.515 align:middle
[REPORTER]
I can tell from the picture

00:18:18.598 --> 00:18:20.475 align:middle
what a perfect match they are!

00:18:20.558 --> 00:18:22.227 align:middle
Aw, it's such a shame...

00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:23.395 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
I'll have more noodles, please!

00:18:23.478 --> 00:18:24.813 align:middle
[RAMEN SHOP OWNER]
On it!

00:18:24.896 --> 00:18:26.690 align:middle
I wish you could've seen them
while they were here.

00:18:26.773 --> 00:18:28.650 align:middle
They drew fortunes together.

00:18:28.733 --> 00:18:29.693 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Hmm?

00:18:29.776 --> 00:18:31.027 align:middle
Wait here.

00:18:31.111 --> 00:18:33.988 align:middle
I'll be back soon,
so stay exactly where you are.

00:18:34.072 --> 00:18:35.990 align:middle
What's up?
You forget something?

00:18:36.074 --> 00:18:38.326 align:middle
I have some business.

00:18:41.371 --> 00:18:42.706 align:middle
What's her deal?

00:18:42.789 --> 00:18:43.873 align:middle
[RAMEN SHOP OWNER]
Harumi.

00:18:43.957 --> 00:18:45.417 align:middle
Here are those noodles.

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:47.377 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Oh, thank you.

00:18:49.754 --> 00:18:51.548 align:middle
It's from Kazama

00:18:51.631 --> 00:18:53.216 align:middle
[REPORTER]
What's happening?

00:18:53.299 --> 00:18:54.676 align:middle
Stop the camera!

00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:20.160 align:middle
[SAKURAI]
Oh, you're awake.

00:19:20.243 --> 00:19:21.745 align:middle
You feel okay?

00:19:24.164 --> 00:19:25.832 align:middle
Hey, Sakurai.

00:19:28.752 --> 00:19:29.669 align:middle
Be real.

00:19:29.753 --> 00:19:31.755 align:middle
Are you looking at my chest?

00:19:31.838 --> 00:19:33.423 align:middle
[KAZAMA]
I was.

00:19:33.506 --> 00:19:35.425 align:middle
[SAKURAI]
At least you're honest.

00:19:36.718 --> 00:19:39.804 align:middle
That cute picture you showed
the reporter got deleted, huh?

00:19:39.888 --> 00:19:42.182 align:middle
I uploaded it to the cloud,
so it still exists.

00:19:42.265 --> 00:19:45.643 align:middle
Uh. Uh... How smart of you.

00:19:45.727 --> 00:19:47.395 align:middle
I'll redownload it.

00:19:49.439 --> 00:19:50.857 align:middle
[SAKURAI]
Kazama?

00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:52.776 align:middle
[KAZAMA]
Hm?

00:19:52.859 --> 00:19:55.612 align:middle
Why did you spend
New Year's with me?

00:19:55.695 --> 00:19:57.113 align:middle
You'd mentioned
before that you were

00:19:57.197 --> 00:20:00.200 align:middle
going to stay home
and game all day.

00:20:02.118 --> 00:20:04.162 align:middle
[KAZAMA]
Well?

00:20:04.245 --> 00:20:07.874 align:middle
All those guys from the office
were asking you out.

00:20:07.957 --> 00:20:10.251 align:middle
So, when you asked me
to celebrate with you

00:20:10.335 --> 00:20:14.506 align:middle
instead of any of them,
it made me feel special,

00:20:14.589 --> 00:20:16.633 align:middle
and I figured it
would be way more fun

00:20:16.716 --> 00:20:19.010 align:middle
than spending the
holiday alone, gaming.

00:20:19.969 --> 00:20:21.596 align:middle
[SAKURAI]
Uh... Uh...

00:20:23.139 --> 00:20:25.517 align:middle
Oh, wow.

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:28.228 align:middle
So that's why. I guess.

00:20:34.526 --> 00:20:38.071 align:middle
I need to stretch my legs a
little after being your pillow.

00:20:38.154 --> 00:20:39.364 align:middle
I'll get us some drinks.

00:20:39.447 --> 00:20:40.573 align:middle
What do you want?

00:20:40.657 --> 00:20:41.449 align:middle
Thanks.

00:20:41.533 --> 00:20:43.535 align:middle
Could I please get a hot tea?

00:20:43.618 --> 00:20:45.203 align:middle
No prob.

00:20:47.914 --> 00:20:49.290 align:middle
[GIRL]
Hello! Mister?

00:20:49.374 --> 00:20:50.834 align:middle
[KAZAMA]
Hmm?

00:20:50.917 --> 00:20:53.545 align:middle
Who's that pretty lady that was
with you just a second ago?

00:20:53.628 --> 00:20:56.464 align:middle
Um. She's a colleague from work.

00:20:56.548 --> 00:20:58.383 align:middle
[GIRL]
What's a colleague?

00:20:58.466 --> 00:20:59.884 align:middle
It means that we're friends.

00:20:59.968 --> 00:21:01.302 align:middle
For real?

00:21:01.386 --> 00:21:02.929 align:middle
You guys aren't dating?

00:21:03.013 --> 00:21:05.724 align:middle
[KAZAMA]
Hmm? Well, no.

00:21:05.807 --> 00:21:08.351 align:middle
[GIRL] But you've gotta
have feelings for her, right?

00:21:08.435 --> 00:21:10.061 align:middle
Huh?

00:21:10.687 --> 00:21:12.397 align:middle
[KAZAMA]
Um...

00:21:14.566 --> 00:21:19.320 align:middle
[KAZAMA] Yeah, I do, but she's
super far out of my league,

00:21:19.404 --> 00:21:22.032 align:middle
and I don't even know
how she feels about me.

00:21:22.115 --> 00:21:25.326 align:middle
Ahhh... Then, look at this!

00:21:25.410 --> 00:21:27.704 align:middle
It'll help. I'm sure!

00:21:27.787 --> 00:21:29.748 align:middle
A toy camera?

00:21:29.831 --> 00:21:31.166 align:middle
[SAKURAI]
Drinks are here!

00:21:32.459 --> 00:21:35.045 align:middle
Aw, aren't you a cutie?

00:21:35.128 --> 00:21:36.129 align:middle
Welcome back.

00:21:36.212 --> 00:21:38.506 align:middle
[GIRL]
Hurry up! You've gotta look now!

00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:40.300 align:middle
Right, I'm on it.

00:21:42.177 --> 00:21:43.345 align:middle
What's this?

00:21:43.428 --> 00:21:45.347 align:middle
Something seems fishy

00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:47.182 align:middle
[GIRL]
Oh, no!

00:21:49.476 --> 00:21:50.977 align:middle
You okay?

00:21:54.189 --> 00:21:56.107 align:middle
[SAKURAI]
Did you see this?

00:21:56.191 --> 00:21:58.234 align:middle
Huh?

00:21:58.318 --> 00:22:00.195 align:middle
I'll ask one more time.

00:22:00.278 --> 00:22:02.822 align:middle
Tell me, did you see this?

00:22:02.906 --> 00:22:05.367 align:middle
[KAZAMA]
No. I didn't--

00:22:05.450 --> 00:22:07.369 align:middle
Well, you can't!

00:22:07.452 --> 00:22:09.329 align:middle
I absolutely forbid it!

00:22:09.412 --> 00:22:11.331 align:middle
Really? What's so bad about it?

00:22:11.414 --> 00:22:12.999 align:middle
Oh, just everything!

00:22:13.083 --> 00:22:15.001 align:middle
But it was a
such a good shot.

00:22:15.085 --> 00:22:17.253 align:middle
No, it's creepy!

00:22:17.337 --> 00:22:18.630 align:middle
[GIRL]
Are you going to erase it?

00:22:18.713 --> 00:22:20.423 align:middle
[SAKURAI]
Of course I am!

00:22:20.507 --> 00:22:22.217 align:middle
[GIRL]
Aww!
