00:00:18.226 --> 00:00:19.936 align:middle
[sighs]

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.939 align:middle
Hey, what're you looking at?

00:00:23.023 --> 00:00:24.232 align:middle
Grandpa.

00:00:24.315 --> 00:00:28.069 align:middle
I mean, I just got a text
from my grandfather.

00:00:28.153 --> 00:00:30.196 align:middle
Ohhh...

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.823 align:middle
Hina dolls, huh?

00:00:31.906 --> 00:00:33.742 align:middle
[FUTABA] He's put them out
for the Doll Festival every year

00:00:33.825 --> 00:00:35.201 align:middle
since I was born.

00:00:35.285 --> 00:00:37.787 align:middle
[SAKURAI]
Aw, he must really adore you.

00:00:37.871 --> 00:00:39.289 align:middle
Hmm?

00:00:39.372 --> 00:00:40.540 align:middle
You know what?

00:00:40.623 --> 00:00:42.751 align:middle
Let's do something nice for him.

00:00:42.834 --> 00:00:44.627 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Huh?

00:00:44.711 --> 00:00:45.837 align:middle
This is not what
I thought you meant

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.922 align:middle
when you said
"do something nice."

00:00:48.006 --> 00:00:49.466 align:middle
We sending him an update?

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:52.552 align:middle
[SAKURAI] I just wanna show him
how happy and healthy you are.

00:00:52.635 --> 00:00:53.928 align:middle
Okay!

00:00:54.012 --> 00:00:55.722 align:middle
I want you both to hold
your hands in front of you.

00:00:55.805 --> 00:00:57.182 align:middle
--Huh?
--Huh?

00:00:57.265 --> 00:00:58.725 align:middle
Something like this?

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:04.105 align:middle
Man, there are so many
super-useful apps these days.

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:06.232 align:middle
Now, hold still.

00:01:10.028 --> 00:01:12.072 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Um, yeah, I can't send him this.

00:01:12.155 --> 00:01:13.782 align:middle
Huh?

00:01:13.865 --> 00:01:17.869 align:middle
Uh-oh, I might've
already hit "send."

00:01:17.952 --> 00:01:19.037 align:middle
You what?

00:01:23.833 --> 00:01:27.712 align:middle
[SAKURAI]
Huh? He just replied.

00:01:27.796 --> 00:01:31.966 align:middle
Huh, he actually
seems kinda mad.

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.594 align:middle
Now he's talking about
how you wet the bed, Futaba.

00:01:34.678 --> 00:01:35.512 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:01:35.595 --> 00:01:37.013 align:middle
What the heck?

00:01:38.848 --> 00:01:40.642 align:middle
And, now you're
blocked, Grandpa!

00:01:40.725 --> 00:01:41.726 align:middle
I'm sorry.

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.646 align:middle
I didn't know that
wouldn't be okay.

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.564 align:middle
So, like, you still
wet the bed, or...?

00:01:46.648 --> 00:01:48.566 align:middle
No, shut up, of course I don't!

00:03:30.627 --> 00:03:33.380 align:middle
So, what're we doing in here?

00:03:33.463 --> 00:03:35.590 align:middle
What prompted this
flower-shop visit?

00:03:35.674 --> 00:03:37.008 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Look it's not like I asked you

00:03:37.092 --> 00:03:39.219 align:middle
to come with me or anything.

00:03:39.302 --> 00:03:42.389 align:middle
Well, figured I might
as well tag along.

00:03:42.472 --> 00:03:44.516 align:middle
What's your excuse?

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:48.728 align:middle
[FUTABA] I'm just here to get
myself a birthday present.

00:03:48.812 --> 00:03:49.938 align:middle
[gasps]

00:03:50.021 --> 00:03:51.815 align:middle
Wait, are you saying
today's your birthday?

00:03:51.898 --> 00:03:53.483 align:middle
Uh.

00:03:53.566 --> 00:03:55.151 align:middle
Yes. Why do you ask?

00:03:55.235 --> 00:03:57.779 align:middle
Because it's mine, too.

00:03:57.862 --> 00:03:59.406 align:middle
Huh?

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:00.949 align:middle
Huuuh?!

00:04:01.032 --> 00:04:03.284 align:middle
Right? Pretty incredible!

00:04:03.368 --> 00:04:05.995 align:middle
Tell you what,
I'll get you your gift,

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:08.957 align:middle
and you get me mine, sound good?

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.584 align:middle
Yeah, you can
just get me whatever,

00:04:11.668 --> 00:04:15.088 align:middle
and I'll do the same for you!

00:04:15.171 --> 00:04:16.673 align:middle
If you're having
trouble deciding,

00:04:16.756 --> 00:04:19.217 align:middle
just know that I'm here to help!

00:04:20.885 --> 00:04:23.304 align:middle
Tulips are always
a lovely choice.

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:26.975 align:middle
[SHOP CLERK]
Here they are in another color.

00:04:27.058 --> 00:04:29.477 align:middle
Right. Let me see.

00:04:30.562 --> 00:04:33.565 align:middle
[SHOP CLERK]
Thanks so much for coming in!

00:04:33.648 --> 00:04:35.984 align:middle
Flowers as gifts are
kind of clichÃ©, I guess.

00:04:36.067 --> 00:04:38.820 align:middle
Well, we can't return 'em now.

00:04:40.238 --> 00:04:41.197 align:middle
Let's do it.

00:04:41.281 --> 00:04:42.574 align:middle
Sure!

00:04:47.454 --> 00:04:48.621 align:middle
--Happy birthday.
--Happy birthday.

00:04:48.705 --> 00:04:51.166 align:middle
--May this year be a good one.
--And many more!

00:04:53.793 --> 00:04:57.964 align:middle
Well, uh...
Thanks. I appreciate this.

00:04:58.048 --> 00:05:00.091 align:middle
Absolutely--same here!

00:05:00.175 --> 00:05:02.010 align:middle
I'll take good care of them.

00:05:04.429 --> 00:05:06.264 align:middle
Come on, let's get out of here.

00:05:06.348 --> 00:05:08.892 align:middle
Sure. Wanna go eat?

00:05:23.239 --> 00:05:25.367 align:middle
Get a load of that guy.

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:27.077 align:middle
No, it can't be.

00:05:33.875 --> 00:05:37.128 align:middle
A very happy birthday
to you, Futaba!

00:05:46.137 --> 00:05:48.431 align:middle
And who the heck are you?

00:05:48.515 --> 00:05:51.393 align:middle
Huh? Ahhh!

00:05:51.476 --> 00:05:54.062 align:middle
You're that guy
from the picture!

00:05:56.022 --> 00:05:57.357 align:middle
Huh?

00:05:58.483 --> 00:06:03.071 align:middle
You give me back
my Futaba! Bastard!

00:06:03.154 --> 00:06:05.281 align:middle
Futaba Igarashi isn't a thing.

00:06:05.365 --> 00:06:07.992 align:middle
She belongs to no one, sir.

00:06:08.076 --> 00:06:10.620 align:middle
Also, who are you?

00:06:10.704 --> 00:06:12.914 align:middle
Oh, he's my grandfather.

00:06:12.997 --> 00:06:15.750 align:middle
Ah! Not this jerk?

00:06:15.834 --> 00:06:17.711 align:middle
Just who are you calling a jerk?

00:06:17.794 --> 00:06:19.629 align:middle
Futaba, who is this jerk?

00:06:19.713 --> 00:06:21.297 align:middle
Did you find him
under a big rock?

00:06:21.381 --> 00:06:22.799 align:middle
Oh, I'm the jerk?

00:06:22.882 --> 00:06:24.300 align:middle
What gives you
the right to say that?

00:06:24.384 --> 00:06:26.136 align:middle
I'm older than you, that's what.

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:27.721 align:middle
So, there.

00:06:29.681 --> 00:06:30.807 align:middle
What's going on?

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:33.059 align:middle
Not sure,
but those guys are huge.

00:06:33.143 --> 00:06:35.437 align:middle
Hey, guys, can we maybe
take this somewhere

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.647 align:middle
a little less mortifying for me?

00:06:42.736 --> 00:06:44.904 align:middle
Listen, I don't care
if you are her supervisor,

00:06:44.988 --> 00:06:48.324 align:middle
you've got no business taking
pictures of just you two.

00:06:48.408 --> 00:06:52.328 align:middle
Wait, are you talking about that
picture we took for fun?

00:06:52.412 --> 00:06:54.205 align:middle
For fun? What does that mean?

00:06:54.289 --> 00:06:56.041 align:middle
Are you toying with Futaba?

00:06:56.124 --> 00:06:58.710 align:middle
Huh? What the hell
are you talking about?

00:06:58.793 --> 00:07:00.253 align:middle
S'cuse me!

00:07:00.337 --> 00:07:03.798 align:middle
Futaba is my perfect and
adorable little granddaughter!

00:07:03.882 --> 00:07:05.050 align:middle
Congrats on that!

00:07:05.133 --> 00:07:08.386 align:middle
She's also my trusted co-worker!

00:07:08.762 --> 00:07:10.680 align:middle
[GRANDPA grumbles]

00:07:10.764 --> 00:07:12.932 align:middle
Ugh!

00:07:13.016 --> 00:07:14.893 align:middle
[GRANDPA] You think you can
put your hand on her head

00:07:14.976 --> 00:07:16.394 align:middle
without my permission?

00:07:16.478 --> 00:07:18.396 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Why? You saying I can't?

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:19.856 align:middle
[GRANDPA]
I'm the only one who's allowed

00:07:19.939 --> 00:07:21.608 align:middle
to pat Futaba on the head!

00:07:21.691 --> 00:07:22.484 align:middle
Period!

00:07:22.567 --> 00:07:23.943 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
What?

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:38.958 align:middle
[GRANDPA] Futaba, have
you really been hanging out

00:07:39.042 --> 00:07:40.168 align:middle
with that big lug?

00:07:40.251 --> 00:07:41.711 align:middle
Huh?

00:07:41.795 --> 00:07:44.089 align:middle
I came all this way to celebrate
my granddaughter's birthday

00:07:44.172 --> 00:07:48.510 align:middle
with her, Futaba,
and you've hurt my feelings.

00:07:48.593 --> 00:07:49.761 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Wha--?

00:07:49.844 --> 00:07:51.221 align:middle
What are you talking about?

00:07:51.304 --> 00:07:53.765 align:middle
I told you, Takeda's
my supervisor from work,

00:07:53.848 --> 00:07:55.266 align:middle
that's all!

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:57.560 align:middle
Tell me the truth, are you
in that kind of relationship?

00:07:57.644 --> 00:07:59.312 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Huh?

00:07:59.396 --> 00:08:00.522 align:middle
Enough!

00:08:00.605 --> 00:08:02.065 align:middle
If you're gonna keep
saying stuff like that,

00:08:02.148 --> 00:08:04.818 align:middle
then you should just go home!

00:08:07.445 --> 00:08:09.948 align:middle
[GRANDPA]
Aw, Futaba.

00:08:12.867 --> 00:08:15.328 align:middle
Natsumi!

00:08:15.412 --> 00:08:17.914 align:middle
There you are.
Sorry it's a day late, but...

00:08:17.997 --> 00:08:19.541 align:middle
Happy birthday to you!

00:08:19.624 --> 00:08:21.001 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Aw, thanks.

00:08:21.084 --> 00:08:22.544 align:middle
Whatever you want,
it's my treat!

00:08:22.627 --> 00:08:25.547 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Oh, sweet! I want cake!

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:27.507 align:middle
Didn't get to have
any yesterday.

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:29.759 align:middle
Excellent choice!

00:08:36.599 --> 00:08:38.059 align:middle
Oh, my aching head.

00:08:38.143 --> 00:08:41.521 align:middle
Guess I drank too much.

00:08:41.604 --> 00:08:46.026 align:middle
Futaba? Where are you? Futaba!

00:08:46.109 --> 00:08:49.779 align:middle
Surely she didn't go out
with that big lug.

00:08:54.325 --> 00:08:57.078 align:middle
With Natsumi? Is that all?

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:06.379 align:middle
[GRANDPA] She'd hate me for
asking, no matter what.

00:09:09.424 --> 00:09:11.676 align:middle
I don't understand the way
Futaba's been thinking lately.

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:13.261 align:middle
[WOMAN C]
Wow, what a plot twist!

00:09:13.345 --> 00:09:15.764 align:middle
[WOMAN D]
Right? It totally blew me away!

00:09:21.728 --> 00:09:24.439 align:middle
[GRANDPA] Maybe if I watch this,
I'll understand.

00:09:34.616 --> 00:09:36.034 align:middle
Well, I for one
never would've thought

00:09:36.117 --> 00:09:38.995 align:middle
that a love could be so pure.

00:09:39.079 --> 00:09:41.831 align:middle
So, modern women trade bodies
with guys in their dreams.

00:09:41.915 --> 00:09:44.042 align:middle
Didn't see that coming, either.

00:09:46.878 --> 00:09:49.506 align:middle
[GRANDPA]
At least I kind of get it now.

00:09:49.589 --> 00:09:52.092 align:middle
Guess I can rest easy
for the moment.

00:09:53.468 --> 00:09:56.221 align:middle
[GRANDPA]
Wait. Hold on.

00:09:56.304 --> 00:09:59.224 align:middle
That's why she's been
so cold to me lately.

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:02.894 align:middle
So weird.

00:10:02.977 --> 00:10:04.312 align:middle
My Grandpa was possessed.

00:10:04.396 --> 00:10:05.814 align:middle
He's just worried about you.

00:10:05.897 --> 00:10:07.399 align:middle
[phone beeps]

00:10:09.776 --> 00:10:11.111 align:middle
Got a text from Grandpa.

00:10:11.194 --> 00:10:13.071 align:middle
He must really love you.

00:10:24.791 --> 00:10:26.251 align:middle
[GRANDPA sighs]

00:10:26.334 --> 00:10:30.005 align:middle
Guess she must be out on a date
with that big lug after all.

00:10:30.547 --> 00:10:31.881 align:middle
[TAKEDA gasps]

00:10:33.675 --> 00:10:35.343 align:middle
What're you lookin' at?

00:10:35.427 --> 00:10:37.887 align:middle
Just wondering why
the heck you're here.

00:10:37.971 --> 00:10:39.055 align:middle
[GRANDPA]
Hmm?

00:10:39.139 --> 00:10:41.057 align:middle
[laughs]

00:10:41.141 --> 00:10:43.518 align:middle
You mean this is where
you've been all day?

00:10:43.601 --> 00:10:45.145 align:middle
Well, that's a load off!

00:10:45.228 --> 00:10:46.896 align:middle
[laughs]

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:49.357 align:middle
Dude, now you're babbling.

00:10:53.236 --> 00:10:54.029 align:middle
[GRANDPA]
Looks like.

00:10:54.112 --> 00:10:56.072 align:middle
I might've finally caught one!

00:11:28.605 --> 00:11:30.106 align:middle
Um, guys.

00:11:32.984 --> 00:11:33.860 align:middle
Still nothing.

00:11:33.943 --> 00:11:35.862 align:middle
Come on, Futaba.

00:11:40.408 --> 00:11:43.119 align:middle
[GRANDPA] Oh, haven't
done this in a while.

00:12:11.398 --> 00:12:13.441 align:middle
Look at 'em go!

00:12:15.193 --> 00:12:18.029 align:middle
Thanks guys! Come again!

00:12:18.113 --> 00:12:19.739 align:middle
Can I get my prizes?

00:12:19.823 --> 00:12:23.159 align:middle
Oh, I'm sorry
but I'm all out of prizes.

00:12:23.243 --> 00:12:24.953 align:middle
Tough luck, kid.

00:12:35.005 --> 00:12:37.799 align:middle
Huh? Harumi! You free?

00:12:37.882 --> 00:12:38.842 align:middle
I bet you are!

00:12:38.925 --> 00:12:40.135 align:middle
Huh?

00:12:44.806 --> 00:12:47.100 align:middle
Shop owners have
to do this volunteer work.

00:12:47.183 --> 00:12:48.977 align:middle
Thanks for pitching in!

00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:51.312 align:middle
Oh, it's no big deal.

00:12:55.817 --> 00:12:57.360 align:middle
Yeah, it's him.

00:12:57.444 --> 00:12:59.946 align:middle
If you wouldn't mind,
could you help us out?

00:13:15.045 --> 00:13:16.421 align:middle
Hey, what gives?

00:13:16.504 --> 00:13:19.341 align:middle
[GRANDPA]
It's first come, first served.

00:13:20.258 --> 00:13:24.137 align:middle
Check it out, I've
collected this much already.

00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:25.722 align:middle
Yeah, same here.

00:13:47.494 --> 00:13:48.953 align:middle
Hey there, Harumi.

00:13:49.037 --> 00:13:50.705 align:middle
How are things go--?

00:14:04.803 --> 00:14:07.097 align:middle
Hey, you, nice work.

00:14:08.556 --> 00:14:10.433 align:middle
Thanks, back at ya'.

00:14:14.646 --> 00:14:16.147 align:middle
[GRANDPA, TAKEDA]
Cheers!

00:14:20.819 --> 00:14:24.489 align:middle
Well, for a man with your looks,
you're an okay guy, you know.

00:14:24.572 --> 00:14:26.533 align:middle
That's the pot
calling the kettle black.

00:14:26.616 --> 00:14:28.076 align:middle
You said it, buddy.

00:14:28.159 --> 00:14:31.413 align:middle
[laughter]

00:14:31.496 --> 00:14:33.748 align:middle
That's recycling. You see?

00:14:39.212 --> 00:14:41.172 align:middle
[GRANDPA]
Futaba.

00:14:41.256 --> 00:14:43.842 align:middle
You're really crazy about
your granddaughter, huh?

00:14:43.925 --> 00:14:45.635 align:middle
Of course I am.

00:14:45.719 --> 00:14:48.847 align:middle
My Futaba. That girl.

00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:53.101 align:middle
She was the most
adorable kid in the world!

00:14:55.270 --> 00:14:58.356 align:middle
[GRANDPA]
Futaba! Futaba!

00:15:02.235 --> 00:15:03.862 align:middle
Hello, Grandpa!

00:15:03.945 --> 00:15:06.698 align:middle
Grandpa's home! Now gimme a hug!

00:15:07.824 --> 00:15:08.950 align:middle
Happy to see me?

00:15:09.034 --> 00:15:10.827 align:middle
Yeah! But you smell weird.

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:13.413 align:middle
But you're happy!
That's what counts!

00:15:16.458 --> 00:15:19.878 align:middle
Futaba, I'm home! Where are you?

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:23.048 align:middle
Hello, Grandpa. Guess what?

00:15:23.131 --> 00:15:24.341 align:middle
I have good news!

00:15:24.424 --> 00:15:26.509 align:middle
[GRANDPA]
Hmm? What is it?

00:15:27.802 --> 00:15:29.971 align:middle
I got a hundred
on my test today.

00:15:30.055 --> 00:15:31.389 align:middle
Well, look at you!

00:15:31.473 --> 00:15:34.225 align:middle
Way to go, little
granddaughter-smarty-pants!

00:15:34.309 --> 00:15:35.769 align:middle
Hey, stop!

00:15:35.852 --> 00:15:38.396 align:middle
Only little kids get their hair
tousled like that, Grandpa.

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:41.066 align:middle
[GRANDPA] Futaba,
tonight we must celebrate!

00:15:41.733 --> 00:15:42.817 align:middle
[GRANDPA]
Huh?

00:15:42.901 --> 00:15:45.487 align:middle
Tokyo? You want to move?

00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:46.738 align:middle
Yeah.

00:15:46.821 --> 00:15:50.909 align:middle
I want to try living
on my own, that's all.

00:15:52.327 --> 00:15:54.954 align:middle
I can't be dependent
on you forever, Grandpa.

00:15:55.038 --> 00:15:58.166 align:middle
That won't be good for me.

00:15:58.249 --> 00:15:59.209 align:middle
[GRANDPA]
I understand.

00:15:59.292 --> 00:16:01.169 align:middle
Huh?

00:16:01.252 --> 00:16:03.046 align:middle
I'm not dead!

00:16:03.129 --> 00:16:05.507 align:middle
You sure it's cool?

00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:07.258 align:middle
Listen, I know you.

00:16:07.342 --> 00:16:10.303 align:middle
You don't make
decisions lightly.

00:16:10.387 --> 00:16:12.514 align:middle
Y'know what they say:

00:16:12.597 --> 00:16:16.685 align:middle
"If you love your child,
send her away on a journey."

00:16:17.811 --> 00:16:19.437 align:middle
Wow. Thanks, Grandpa!

00:16:19.521 --> 00:16:21.147 align:middle
[GRANDPA]
However!

00:16:21.231 --> 00:16:23.942 align:middle
Beware of all those
dangerous city boys.

00:16:24.025 --> 00:16:26.945 align:middle
Wolves in sheep's clothing,
every single one of them.

00:16:27.028 --> 00:16:29.239 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Uh, yeah, all right.

00:16:31.574 --> 00:16:34.953 align:middle
So glad I'm basically
done unpacking.

00:16:35.036 --> 00:16:37.706 align:middle
And tomorrow is
the first day of school.

00:16:37.789 --> 00:16:40.542 align:middle
I wonder if
I'll make any friends.

00:16:40.625 --> 00:16:42.502 align:middle
Well, I've gotta try.

00:16:43.545 --> 00:16:44.671 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Interesting.

00:16:44.754 --> 00:16:48.842 align:middle
So... she's been living
on her own since then.

00:16:48.925 --> 00:16:50.677 align:middle
That must be why
she's such a good cook.

00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:51.594 align:middle
[GRANDPA]
Hmm?

00:16:51.678 --> 00:16:53.888 align:middle
What? Explain yourself.

00:16:53.972 --> 00:16:56.474 align:middle
You've tasted some of
Futaba's home cooking?

00:16:56.558 --> 00:16:58.643 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
I have. It was really good.

00:16:58.727 --> 00:17:02.230 align:middle
[GRANDPA]
Whaaaat?!

00:17:02.939 --> 00:17:05.984 align:middle
[GRANDPA]
Mmm! Mmm!

00:17:06.067 --> 00:17:09.154 align:middle
You really are a
talented cook, Futaba.

00:17:10.947 --> 00:17:12.323 align:middle
So, tell me something.

00:17:12.407 --> 00:17:13.950 align:middle
What did you make that fellow?

00:17:14.034 --> 00:17:15.243 align:middle
[FUTABA grumbles]

00:17:15.326 --> 00:17:16.327 align:middle
That's enough!

00:17:16.411 --> 00:17:17.620 align:middle
You come spend the night

00:17:17.704 --> 00:17:20.165 align:middle
with no notice then go
head-to-head with Takeda?

00:17:20.248 --> 00:17:22.500 align:middle
Knock it off, okay?

00:17:22.584 --> 00:17:24.669 align:middle
I'm concerned about you, Futaba.

00:17:24.753 --> 00:17:27.547 align:middle
[FUTABA] You do realize
I'm 23 years old, right?

00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:30.633 align:middle
I'm gonna worry about you
until the day you die!

00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:35.305 align:middle
[SAKURAI]
Ahhhh!

00:17:35.388 --> 00:17:38.141 align:middle
How lovely! Is this
your White Day gift?

00:17:38.224 --> 00:17:41.436 align:middle
Well done!
I absolutely love macarons.

00:17:41.519 --> 00:17:43.104 align:middle
Thanks so much!

00:17:43.188 --> 00:17:45.148 align:middle
Glad to hear it.

00:17:45.815 --> 00:17:48.902 align:middle
[HIJIKATA] Sounds like
Sakurai really digs macarons.

00:17:48.985 --> 00:17:50.236 align:middle
Better make a note.

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:53.406 align:middle
I doubt that note will
ever be of any use to you.

00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:54.657 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Hey.

00:17:54.741 --> 00:17:56.534 align:middle
Where is she? Igarashi?

00:17:56.618 --> 00:17:59.329 align:middle
[OOISHI]
Oh, uh. Let's see.

00:17:59.412 --> 00:18:01.414 align:middle
I think she might be...

00:18:02.999 --> 00:18:05.210 align:middle
Ah! Great, there you are.

00:18:05.293 --> 00:18:06.961 align:middle
What's shakin', Igarashi?

00:18:09.214 --> 00:18:11.216 align:middle
Nothin'. Hi.

00:18:11.925 --> 00:18:13.551 align:middle
Uh...

00:18:16.137 --> 00:18:18.807 align:middle
Yep. There's a lot
of pollen flying around.

00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:21.768 align:middle
Here, some meds.

00:18:21.851 --> 00:18:23.520 align:middle
Got you a variety.

00:18:23.603 --> 00:18:26.272 align:middle
Oh my goodness. Thank you.

00:18:26.356 --> 00:18:27.315 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Open your eyes.

00:18:27.399 --> 00:18:29.442 align:middle
I'm putting the drops in now.

00:18:32.112 --> 00:18:35.657 align:middle
[sighs]
That did actually help some.

00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:37.117 align:middle
Sorry about that.

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:39.452 align:middle
Oh, it's no problem at all.

00:18:39.536 --> 00:18:41.663 align:middle
But you should learn
how to do it yourself.

00:18:41.746 --> 00:18:44.874 align:middle
Yeah, I know, but that
dropper thing scares me.

00:18:44.958 --> 00:18:47.252 align:middle
Sounds like you've
got a sore throat, too.

00:18:47.335 --> 00:18:48.712 align:middle
Have some hard candy.

00:18:48.795 --> 00:18:50.755 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Ooo, thank you.

00:18:54.175 --> 00:18:55.969 align:middle
I'm headin' back. See ya.

00:18:56.052 --> 00:18:57.887 align:middle
[FUTABA]
'Kay.

00:18:57.971 --> 00:19:00.807 align:middle
Since you shared that
chocolate with me a while back.

00:19:00.890 --> 00:19:01.766 align:middle
It's my turn.

00:19:01.850 --> 00:19:03.852 align:middle
I'll treat you to a meal today.

00:19:03.935 --> 00:19:05.437 align:middle
Whatever you want.

00:19:06.354 --> 00:19:10.400 align:middle
[FUTABA]
That's right. Today's White Day!

00:19:10.483 --> 00:19:12.610 align:middle
He actually remembered.

00:19:17.741 --> 00:19:19.367 align:middle
So, what are you
in the mood for?

00:19:19.451 --> 00:19:21.494 align:middle
I dunno, let me think.

00:19:23.329 --> 00:19:26.666 align:middle
Sorry, I'm afraid I've
got to go take a leak first.

00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:28.835 align:middle
[FUTABA] Okay then,
I'll hold your briefcase.

00:19:28.918 --> 00:19:30.628 align:middle
Thanks for that!

00:19:30.712 --> 00:19:32.339 align:middle
I'll be right back!

00:19:37.344 --> 00:19:41.139 align:middle
[BOTH] Ahhh...
I swear, I almost wet my pants.

00:19:42.307 --> 00:19:44.267 align:middle
Hey, what the heck
are you doing here?

00:19:44.351 --> 00:19:45.852 align:middle
It's just a coincidence!

00:19:45.935 --> 00:19:47.354 align:middle
A coincidence!

00:19:51.316 --> 00:19:52.442 align:middle
[GRANDPA]
Hey.

00:19:52.525 --> 00:19:53.610 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Hmm?

00:19:53.693 --> 00:19:55.362 align:middle
Is she doing a good job?

00:19:55.445 --> 00:19:58.531 align:middle
My Futaba?

00:19:58.615 --> 00:20:01.284 align:middle
Maybe you should ask her
that yourself, huh?

00:20:01.368 --> 00:20:02.410 align:middle
[GRANDPA]
I don't want her to hate me

00:20:02.494 --> 00:20:04.788 align:middle
for asking a bunch of questions.

00:20:04.871 --> 00:20:07.540 align:middle
Do you know what
a coward you are?

00:20:07.624 --> 00:20:09.709 align:middle
She's doing a fine job.

00:20:09.793 --> 00:20:12.629 align:middle
She's pretty headstrong,
like someone else here.

00:20:15.173 --> 00:20:18.218 align:middle
Futaba and I were about
to get something to eat.

00:20:18.301 --> 00:20:19.511 align:middle
You should come join us.

00:20:19.594 --> 00:20:21.179 align:middle
[GRANDPA]
Hmm?

00:20:21.262 --> 00:20:23.306 align:middle
Oh. Well, I'll be.

00:20:24.474 --> 00:20:26.601 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Stop it! Get away from me!

00:20:26.685 --> 00:20:28.186 align:middle
[THUG A] What's a
little kid like you doing

00:20:28.269 --> 00:20:30.563 align:middle
wearing a freakin'
business suit?

00:20:30.647 --> 00:20:31.398 align:middle
Ah!

00:20:31.481 --> 00:20:32.982 align:middle
Wait, don't even tell me.

00:20:33.066 --> 00:20:34.567 align:middle
You're actually a businesswoman?

00:20:34.651 --> 00:20:35.944 align:middle
Dude, that's hysterical!

00:20:36.027 --> 00:20:38.488 align:middle
--[THUG B] Seriously?
--[laughter]

00:20:38.571 --> 00:20:40.573 align:middle
Hey, now,
don't cry, little lady.

00:20:40.657 --> 00:20:43.910 align:middle
That makes it look like
we're doing something mean.

00:20:44.911 --> 00:20:48.123 align:middle
Come on now,
dry those little eyes.

00:20:48.748 --> 00:20:50.709 align:middle
There's a good girl.

00:20:57.173 --> 00:21:00.218 align:middle
Pardon me, but did anyone
say you could touch her?

00:21:02.387 --> 00:21:03.638 align:middle
What's up with this guy?

00:21:03.722 --> 00:21:05.557 align:middle
Daddy's come to the rescue?

00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:06.975 align:middle
He's just doing the thing
where you act tough

00:21:07.058 --> 00:21:08.685 align:middle
in front of your kid.

00:21:13.523 --> 00:21:16.234 align:middle
[GRANDPA]
Hey.

00:21:16.317 --> 00:21:18.778 align:middle
You got it all wrong.

00:21:18.862 --> 00:21:20.697 align:middle
It's not her dad.

00:21:22.907 --> 00:21:27.579 align:middle
Grandpa's come to the rescue,
you pathetic little punks!

00:21:27.662 --> 00:21:30.832 align:middle
[THUGS scream]

00:21:33.168 --> 00:21:34.169 align:middle
Sorry!

00:21:34.252 --> 00:21:36.046 align:middle
Please, you don't
have to apologize.

00:21:36.129 --> 00:21:38.673 align:middle
It's not like I
got hurt or anything.

00:21:38.757 --> 00:21:41.676 align:middle
My granddaughter really
does have a heart of gold.

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:44.554 align:middle
Should I even ask what
you're doing here, Grandpa?

00:21:44.637 --> 00:21:46.598 align:middle
It's hard to accept it.

00:21:46.681 --> 00:21:49.893 align:middle
We couldn't shield you
from that experience.

00:21:49.976 --> 00:21:53.104 align:middle
[FUTABA] Okay, "What are
you doing here, Grandpa?"

00:21:53.188 --> 00:21:56.024 align:middle
You must've been scared, Futaba.

00:21:57.442 --> 00:21:59.861 align:middle
Whenever you feel
like you need a good cry,

00:21:59.944 --> 00:22:02.072 align:middle
just know that your
Grandpa's arms are always open

00:22:02.155 --> 00:22:04.616 align:middle
and waiting for you, baby girl!

00:22:07.577 --> 00:22:11.748 align:middle
Well, whatcha gonna do, I guess.

00:22:11.831 --> 00:22:14.209 align:middle
All right!
Let's get something to eat.

00:22:14.292 --> 00:22:16.503 align:middle
You, too, Gramps!

00:22:16.586 --> 00:22:19.297 align:middle
Hey, Grandpa, what
do you feel like having?

00:22:19.381 --> 00:22:21.216 align:middle
Well, lemme think.

00:22:21.299 --> 00:22:23.551 align:middle
[BOTH laugh]
