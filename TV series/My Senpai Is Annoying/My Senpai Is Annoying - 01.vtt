[alarm beeps]

00:00:26.443 --> 00:00:31.865 align:middle
[FUTABA groans]

00:00:38.663 --> 00:00:40.165 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Ouch!

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.021 align:middle
[FUTABA]
And, done.

00:01:12.906 --> 00:01:14.824 align:middle
Thanks for all the yummy food!

00:01:43.687 --> 00:01:45.647 align:middle
Time to go slay the day!

00:01:46.564 --> 00:01:48.274 align:middle
Good morning, sir!

00:01:48.358 --> 00:01:49.943 align:middle
Good morning to you.

00:02:15.593 --> 00:02:17.762 align:middle
[SAKURAI]
Futaba?

00:02:17.846 --> 00:02:19.848 align:middle
I thought that was you!

00:02:19.931 --> 00:02:21.558 align:middle
Sakurai! Yeah, it's me.

00:02:21.641 --> 00:02:22.976 align:middle
Good morning!

00:02:27.772 --> 00:02:30.400 align:middle
[FUTABA] Those always make
me wish mine were bigger.

00:02:32.652 --> 00:02:35.238 align:middle
Sorry, you just
startled me, that's all.

00:02:35.321 --> 00:02:38.199 align:middle
[SAKURAI] Hey, your eyes
look a little bloodshot.

00:02:38.283 --> 00:02:40.368 align:middle
[FUTABA] I had a hard time
falling asleep last night,

00:02:40.452 --> 00:02:42.328 align:middle
thinking about
today's presentation.

00:02:42.412 --> 00:02:44.289 align:middle
[SAKURAI]
Goodness!

00:02:44.372 --> 00:02:46.541 align:middle
You sure seem to love your work.

00:02:46.624 --> 00:02:49.627 align:middle
I wanna be in
full-time sales ASAP.

00:02:52.672 --> 00:02:54.507 align:middle
Hey, good morning, everyone!

00:02:54.591 --> 00:02:56.092 align:middle
--Good morning.
--Good morning.

00:02:58.053 --> 00:02:59.554 align:middle
Hey, what's up, Kazama?

00:02:59.637 --> 00:03:00.638 align:middle
Good morning!

00:03:00.722 --> 00:03:02.098 align:middle
[KAZAMA]
Morning.

00:03:04.267 --> 00:03:06.144 align:middle
Kazama. How's it going?

00:03:06.227 --> 00:03:07.145 align:middle
[KAZAMA]
Hmm?

00:03:07.228 --> 00:03:08.646 align:middle
Hey.

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.399 align:middle
Chief! Good morning to you, sir.

00:03:11.483 --> 00:03:12.609 align:middle
Hello there.

00:03:12.692 --> 00:03:14.152 align:middle
You're always such
a chipper presence

00:03:14.235 --> 00:03:15.528 align:middle
in the office, Igarashi.

00:03:15.612 --> 00:03:17.322 align:middle
Thanks. Keep it up.

00:03:19.741 --> 00:03:21.117 align:middle
Huh?

00:03:23.912 --> 00:03:26.289 align:middle
Igarashi! Hey!

00:03:26.373 --> 00:03:28.458 align:middle
Ahh! Why do you have to do that?

00:03:28.541 --> 00:03:30.585 align:middle
It scared me to death.

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:32.545 align:middle
Your voice is so loud.

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:34.714 align:middle
[laughs]

00:03:34.798 --> 00:03:36.007 align:middle
Well, I just wanted to give

00:03:36.091 --> 00:03:38.468 align:middle
as hearty a greeting
as you do, Igarashi.

00:03:38.551 --> 00:03:39.594 align:middle
Why would you compete

00:03:39.678 --> 00:03:41.179 align:middle
with someone who
works underneath you?

00:03:47.268 --> 00:03:48.561 align:middle
[sighs]

00:03:53.191 --> 00:03:56.778 align:middle
Mister Takeda, would you mind
glancing over my presentation?

00:03:56.861 --> 00:03:58.154 align:middle
No prob!

00:04:00.365 --> 00:04:03.618 align:middle
[FUTABA] My supervisor
has a super-big voice.

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:06.454 align:middle
[FUTABA]
And a body to match.

00:04:06.538 --> 00:04:07.831 align:middle
Yeah, this looks great!

00:04:07.914 --> 00:04:09.791 align:middle
Well done, kiddo!

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:15.088 align:middle
[FUTABA grumbles]

00:04:15.171 --> 00:04:17.215 align:middle
Would you please
not tousle my hair?

00:04:17.298 --> 00:04:20.385 align:middle
Not sure if you know this,
but I am a full-grown adult.

00:04:20.468 --> 00:04:22.095 align:middle
[laughs]

00:04:22.178 --> 00:04:24.723 align:middle
Stop laughing!
It is so not funny!

00:04:24.806 --> 00:04:26.266 align:middle
My bad, I'm sorry.

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:28.309 align:middle
You did such a great job
on those documents,

00:04:28.393 --> 00:04:29.978 align:middle
I couldn't resist.

00:04:31.896 --> 00:04:37.986 align:middle
[FUTABA] My supervisor is a
big guy, and a little annoying.

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:42.282 align:middle
Honestly. He's so quick to
treat me like a total infant.

00:04:42.365 --> 00:04:45.285 align:middle
What's with the hair tousling?

00:04:45.368 --> 00:04:48.246 align:middle
Although, he did
tell me he thought

00:04:48.329 --> 00:04:50.915 align:middle
I had done a really great job.

00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:53.209 align:middle
Hey, <i>dobroye utro</i> !

00:04:53.293 --> 00:04:56.463 align:middle
[shrieks]
Tsukishiro!

00:04:56.546 --> 00:04:57.922 align:middle
Don't sneak up
behind me like that,

00:04:58.006 --> 00:04:59.382 align:middle
it totally freaks me out!

00:04:59.466 --> 00:05:03.136 align:middle
[laughs] Sorry about that.
You having coffee?

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:04.429 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Sure.

00:05:04.512 --> 00:05:06.139 align:middle
I mean, it's what adults
drink in the morning,

00:05:06.222 --> 00:05:08.558 align:middle
so yeah, of course I am.

00:05:11.686 --> 00:05:14.397 align:middle
It's kind of bitter, though,
so I do add some sugar.

00:05:14.481 --> 00:05:15.940 align:middle
Yes, I can see that.

00:05:16.024 --> 00:05:17.984 align:middle
[FUTABA] Would you
like to have some, too?

00:05:18.068 --> 00:05:19.486 align:middle
No. Thanks, though.

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:22.155 align:middle
This is my favorite drink
in the morning...

00:05:22.947 --> 00:05:24.324 align:middle
...right here.

00:05:27.327 --> 00:05:30.872 align:middle
Uh, well, that's--that's
just crazy!

00:05:30.955 --> 00:05:34.042 align:middle
You know you shouldn't
be drinking vodka at work!

00:05:34.125 --> 00:05:36.878 align:middle
Funny thing is,
it may be in a vodka bottle,

00:05:36.961 --> 00:05:38.546 align:middle
but it's actually water.

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:39.839 align:middle
Huh?

00:05:48.431 --> 00:05:50.141 align:middle
See you later.

00:05:51.393 --> 00:05:53.978 align:middle
Well, she's certainly
a strange one.

00:05:54.062 --> 00:05:57.941 align:middle
'Kay. Going out to
make some sales calls.

00:06:02.904 --> 00:06:04.739 align:middle
I'm going, too!

00:06:04.823 --> 00:06:06.658 align:middle
Be careful out there!

00:06:18.211 --> 00:06:19.170 align:middle
Is there a problem?

00:06:19.254 --> 00:06:21.006 align:middle
Cause you're
definitely walking slow.

00:06:21.089 --> 00:06:22.924 align:middle
Oh, do you think so?

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:28.179 align:middle
I keep telling you
you don't have to do that.

00:06:28.263 --> 00:06:31.224 align:middle
I really don't need you
to adjust your pace for me.

00:06:31.307 --> 00:06:33.184 align:middle
Well, that's good,
because I'm not.

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:38.898 align:middle
What's wrong with it, anyway?

00:06:38.982 --> 00:06:41.109 align:middle
Taking your time isn't bad.

00:06:41.192 --> 00:06:43.570 align:middle
Yeah, but, in sales,
speed is of the essence,

00:06:43.653 --> 00:06:45.030 align:middle
you know that.

00:06:45.113 --> 00:06:47.032 align:middle
Now c'mon, pick up the pace!

00:06:47.115 --> 00:06:48.700 align:middle
Okay!

00:07:07.635 --> 00:07:12.390 align:middle
[panting]

00:07:16.311 --> 00:07:17.771 align:middle
Oo!

00:07:26.821 --> 00:07:28.114 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Getting something to drink?

00:07:28.198 --> 00:07:29.366 align:middle
Nah.

00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:31.910 align:middle
I'm bummed it
doesn't have <i>oshiruko</i> .

00:07:32.869 --> 00:07:33.828 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Well, there's no rule that says

00:07:33.912 --> 00:07:36.748 align:middle
all vending machines
have to have it.

00:07:36.831 --> 00:07:39.209 align:middle
Fair point.

00:07:39.292 --> 00:07:41.211 align:middle
Why don't we go get
ourselves some lunch?

00:07:41.294 --> 00:07:44.422 align:middle
Sound good? What would you like?

00:07:44.506 --> 00:07:46.257 align:middle
It seems like we're
always going to the places

00:07:46.341 --> 00:07:48.093 align:middle
where I want to eat.

00:07:48.176 --> 00:07:52.222 align:middle
So, maybe we could go somewhere
you'd like to eat for a change.

00:07:52.305 --> 00:07:53.890 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
I'm fine with whatever!

00:07:53.973 --> 00:07:55.684 align:middle
Ugh, everybody knows
that the people

00:07:55.767 --> 00:07:57.894 align:middle
who say that are the worst.

00:07:57.977 --> 00:08:00.271 align:middle
How about...

00:08:00.355 --> 00:08:01.856 align:middle
[CASHIER]
Can I take your order?

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:03.650 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
I'll have five Jaja King Burgers

00:08:03.733 --> 00:08:05.110 align:middle
and three orders of fries.

00:08:05.193 --> 00:08:07.028 align:middle
Anything else for you today?

00:08:07.112 --> 00:08:08.613 align:middle
Igarashi?

00:08:12.367 --> 00:08:13.785 align:middle
[FUTABA]
What's that?

00:08:13.868 --> 00:08:16.371 align:middle
Oh my gosh, I love how you
can't tell where it's looking!

00:08:16.454 --> 00:08:18.373 align:middle
Freaking adorable!

00:08:18.456 --> 00:08:20.500 align:middle
But I can't order a Lucky Meal.

00:08:20.583 --> 00:08:23.628 align:middle
No way could I do
that in front of Takeda!

00:08:23.712 --> 00:08:26.047 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
All right, one Lucky Meal.

00:08:27.757 --> 00:08:29.175 align:middle
[TAKEDA] And make sure
to give her one of those dolls,

00:08:29.259 --> 00:08:30.301 align:middle
would ya?

00:08:30.385 --> 00:08:31.845 align:middle
I think she likes it.

00:08:31.928 --> 00:08:33.388 align:middle
[CASHIER]
Coming right up!

00:08:40.478 --> 00:08:42.397 align:middle
[laughs]

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:44.190 align:middle
Stop laughing at me like that!

00:08:44.274 --> 00:08:47.610 align:middle
Sorry, that's my bad.
Are you okay?

00:08:47.694 --> 00:08:49.654 align:middle
Of course I am.

00:08:49.738 --> 00:08:50.697 align:middle
I thought this might happen,

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:53.199 align:middle
so I spread a napkin on my lap.

00:08:53.283 --> 00:08:55.952 align:middle
I'm in my second year at
the company now, you know,

00:08:56.036 --> 00:08:59.289 align:middle
so I can manage a crisis!

00:08:59.372 --> 00:09:01.750 align:middle
Is that so? I know!

00:09:01.833 --> 00:09:02.751 align:middle
How 'bout this?

00:09:02.834 --> 00:09:04.419 align:middle
You give today's presentation.

00:09:04.502 --> 00:09:05.795 align:middle
Huh?

00:09:05.879 --> 00:09:07.881 align:middle
Well, you prepared
those documents.

00:09:07.964 --> 00:09:10.091 align:middle
You know what's
in them as well as I do.

00:09:10.175 --> 00:09:11.676 align:middle
So, if you feel like it--

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:15.055 align:middle
I do! Please,
allow me to handle it!

00:09:15.138 --> 00:09:17.807 align:middle
Okay, then it's all yours.

00:09:17.891 --> 00:09:19.684 align:middle
[FUTABA] It's my second
year with the company,

00:09:19.768 --> 00:09:22.145 align:middle
and the day has finally come!

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:27.233 align:middle
[FUTABA] If I do this and
it leads to a contract,

00:09:27.317 --> 00:09:30.487 align:middle
I'll be a full-fledged
salesperson!

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:32.947 align:middle
I'll show everyone
I can do this!

00:09:42.874 --> 00:09:44.209 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Uh-oh.

00:09:44.292 --> 00:09:46.544 align:middle
Now I'm getting all nervous!

00:09:46.628 --> 00:09:48.505 align:middle
What should I do?

00:09:50.048 --> 00:09:52.258 align:middle
[TAKEDA] Thanks for agreeing
to meet with us today.

00:09:52.342 --> 00:09:54.177 align:middle
We appreciate your time.

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:57.347 align:middle
First things first, Itomaki
Trading submits this proposal

00:09:57.430 --> 00:09:59.808 align:middle
with the utmost confidence.

00:09:59.891 --> 00:10:02.227 align:middle
We hope you will give
it your consideration.

00:10:04.145 --> 00:10:05.980 align:middle
[TAKEDA whispers]
Break a leg.

00:10:08.775 --> 00:10:10.151 align:middle
All right, then!

00:10:10.235 --> 00:10:13.613 align:middle
I'm Igarashi. Please allow me
to present our proposal.

00:10:17.534 --> 00:10:19.828 align:middle
Yes! It's over!

00:10:19.911 --> 00:10:22.247 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
You did great back there!

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:23.498 align:middle
That was excellent!

00:10:25.375 --> 00:10:27.544 align:middle
Haven't I already told you?

00:10:27.627 --> 00:10:30.422 align:middle
Do not tousle
my hair like a toddler!

00:10:30.505 --> 00:10:33.133 align:middle
I get it, but your hair's
just so easy to tousle.

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:37.053 align:middle
Good grip!

00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:41.016 align:middle
[WOMAN A]
Get a load of those two!

00:10:41.099 --> 00:10:42.600 align:middle
[laughter]

00:10:44.853 --> 00:10:46.855 align:middle
What're you guys doing?

00:10:47.689 --> 00:10:48.773 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Hmm?

00:10:48.857 --> 00:10:50.108 align:middle
Wait a minute, Kazama?

00:10:50.191 --> 00:10:51.818 align:middle
Why're you here?

00:10:51.901 --> 00:10:53.319 align:middle
You done making your rounds?

00:10:53.403 --> 00:10:56.489 align:middle
Yes, I'm just about
to head back to the office.

00:10:56.573 --> 00:10:58.950 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Great! Let's go together, then.

00:11:01.494 --> 00:11:03.204 align:middle
Wow, you don't say?

00:11:03.288 --> 00:11:05.457 align:middle
Yeah I hear their
food's pretty good.

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:08.335 align:middle
I should try it out sometime.

00:11:14.466 --> 00:11:16.885 align:middle
I'm not surprised,
with how hard she works.

00:11:16.968 --> 00:11:18.553 align:middle
She barely sleeps.

00:11:20.263 --> 00:11:23.266 align:middle
And, she's chewing her hair.

00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:24.809 align:middle
--Huh?
--Huh?

00:11:24.893 --> 00:11:27.896 align:middle
[KAZAMA] She really is
sleeping hard, isn't she?

00:11:30.273 --> 00:11:31.441 align:middle
[KAZAMA]
Want me to wake her?

00:11:31.524 --> 00:11:34.402 align:middle
Nah, it's fine.
We should let her get some rest.

00:11:35.612 --> 00:11:39.366 align:middle
[KAZAMA]
Hmm... Takeda, may I?

00:11:39.449 --> 00:11:40.909 align:middle
Huh?

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:50.669 align:middle
[EMPLOYEE D]
Oh, look! Igarashi's back.

00:11:50.752 --> 00:11:51.586 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Hmm?

00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:53.171 align:middle
[chuckles]
So adorable!

00:11:53.254 --> 00:11:55.173 align:middle
Isn't it?

00:11:55.256 --> 00:11:56.925 align:middle
[SAKURAI]
Look who's back!

00:11:57.008 --> 00:11:58.259 align:middle
Hi, Sakurai.

00:11:58.343 --> 00:11:59.552 align:middle
Did you have a nice nap?

00:11:59.636 --> 00:12:01.012 align:middle
Little kitten?

00:12:01.096 --> 00:12:01.888 align:middle
What?

00:12:01.971 --> 00:12:04.974 align:middle
I can't handle how cute this is!

00:12:06.685 --> 00:12:08.061 align:middle
What is that?

00:12:14.526 --> 00:12:17.904 align:middle
[FUTABA] Well, Kazama,
do you have any last words?

00:12:17.987 --> 00:12:19.572 align:middle
C'mon calm down, Igarashi--

00:12:19.656 --> 00:12:20.407 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Divine wrath!

00:12:20.490 --> 00:12:22.701 align:middle
[KAZAMA groans]

00:12:26.329 --> 00:12:28.498 align:middle
I gave that presentation
all by myself,

00:12:28.581 --> 00:12:31.251 align:middle
so now I'm a
full-fledged salesperson.

00:12:44.305 --> 00:12:48.268 align:middle
[phone beeping]

00:12:51.146 --> 00:12:53.815 align:middle
[FUTABA] What are you
going on about, Grandpa?

00:12:53.898 --> 00:12:55.191 align:middle
Oh, who cares?

00:12:55.275 --> 00:12:57.110 align:middle
I'm gonna take a bath.

00:12:59.988 --> 00:13:01.114 align:middle
[gasps]

00:13:01.197 --> 00:13:03.408 align:middle
Maki Textiles called
to put in a complaint.

00:13:03.491 --> 00:13:06.286 align:middle
Said they received the wrong
number of items in their order.

00:13:06.369 --> 00:13:09.247 align:middle
They suspect it was a
miscommunication on our end.

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:11.666 align:middle
But that can't be! It's just...

00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:13.084 align:middle
I'm sure I placed the order

00:13:13.168 --> 00:13:16.046 align:middle
with the manufacturer
following their instructions.

00:13:18.465 --> 00:13:19.591 align:middle
Ah...

00:13:19.674 --> 00:13:21.343 align:middle
What's the matter?

00:13:21.426 --> 00:13:22.802 align:middle
[FUTABA] The numbers
in the purchase order

00:13:22.886 --> 00:13:25.930 align:middle
are off by one line.

00:13:26.014 --> 00:13:28.725 align:middle
[CHIEF] Takeda, did you check
this before it went out?

00:13:28.808 --> 00:13:29.809 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
No, I...

00:13:29.893 --> 00:13:31.061 align:middle
I placed the order
without asking him

00:13:31.144 --> 00:13:33.772 align:middle
to look it over first.

00:13:33.855 --> 00:13:36.107 align:middle
I thought I had to hurry.

00:13:36.191 --> 00:13:39.277 align:middle
These things must always
be double-checked, though.

00:13:39.361 --> 00:13:40.820 align:middle
Apologies!

00:13:40.904 --> 00:13:44.366 align:middle
This happened because
of my negligence!

00:13:45.367 --> 00:13:46.701 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Hmm...

00:13:50.705 --> 00:13:52.499 align:middle
[FUTABA]
'Scuse me, sir.

00:13:52.582 --> 00:13:55.085 align:middle
I'm just... I'm sor--

00:13:55.168 --> 00:13:56.878 align:middle
Huh?

00:13:56.961 --> 00:13:58.880 align:middle
I don't need any
of your apologies,

00:13:58.963 --> 00:14:01.883 align:middle
but someone else does.

00:14:01.966 --> 00:14:04.094 align:middle
Let's go see the client!

00:14:05.637 --> 00:14:07.722 align:middle
Oh. Okay!

00:14:08.598 --> 00:14:10.684 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Please accept our apologies!

00:14:10.767 --> 00:14:11.893 align:middle
Please, do.

00:14:11.976 --> 00:14:14.437 align:middle
I'm so sorry for making
such a big mistake!

00:14:15.939 --> 00:14:18.024 align:middle
[FUTABA]
It's all my fault.

00:14:22.237 --> 00:14:24.406 align:middle
[SAKURAI] Do you know
what's wrong with Futaba?

00:14:24.489 --> 00:14:26.658 align:middle
Heard she had some
trouble with a client.

00:14:29.744 --> 00:14:30.704 align:middle
Hey, what's up?

00:14:30.787 --> 00:14:31.955 align:middle
Are you okay?

00:14:32.038 --> 00:14:34.416 align:middle
Oh, sure,
sorry to make you worry.

00:14:34.499 --> 00:14:36.001 align:middle
I'm doing fine.

00:14:36.084 --> 00:14:37.919 align:middle
[SAKURAI]
Hmm...

00:14:40.922 --> 00:14:43.341 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Think I'll have some <i>oshiruko</i> .

00:14:46.386 --> 00:14:47.637 align:middle
Huh?

00:14:47.721 --> 00:14:49.222 align:middle
Sold out.

00:14:52.017 --> 00:14:53.727 align:middle
[FUTABA grunts softly]

00:14:57.272 --> 00:15:00.775 align:middle
[FUTABA begins to cry]

00:15:00.859 --> 00:15:02.444 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Ah! There you are!

00:15:02.527 --> 00:15:03.445 align:middle
Huh?

00:15:03.528 --> 00:15:04.529 align:middle
Sir.

00:15:04.612 --> 00:15:07.073 align:middle
Here! Think fast!

00:15:07.157 --> 00:15:08.199 align:middle
Ah!

00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:12.662 align:middle
<i>Oshiruko?</i>

00:15:12.746 --> 00:15:14.831 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Don't worry so much.

00:15:35.643 --> 00:15:37.854 align:middle
[FUTABA]
It's so sweet.

00:15:37.937 --> 00:15:39.272 align:middle
Bye, I'm taking off!

00:15:39.356 --> 00:15:40.690 align:middle
[EMPLOYEE C]
See you tomorrow!

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:43.485 align:middle
[SAKURAI]
Futaba?

00:15:43.568 --> 00:15:44.694 align:middle
Huh?

00:15:44.778 --> 00:15:46.404 align:middle
Why don't we go out
and have a little fun?

00:15:46.488 --> 00:15:47.322 align:middle
Huh?!

00:15:47.405 --> 00:15:48.948 align:middle
C'mon, you deserve a break.

00:15:49.032 --> 00:15:49.866 align:middle
Right?

00:15:49.949 --> 00:15:51.659 align:middle
I don't know.

00:15:51.743 --> 00:15:53.328 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Go with her.

00:15:53.411 --> 00:15:56.039 align:middle
Breaks are vital. Go take one.

00:15:57.916 --> 00:15:59.376 align:middle
Feel like hittin' the arcade?

00:15:59.459 --> 00:16:00.919 align:middle
Yes, what a great idea!

00:16:01.002 --> 00:16:03.088 align:middle
The more the merrier,
I always say!

00:16:03.171 --> 00:16:05.298 align:middle
How 'bout you? Coming?

00:16:06.508 --> 00:16:09.010 align:middle
Sure. Thanks for inviting me.

00:16:12.347 --> 00:16:14.641 align:middle
[FUTABA] Thanks for asking
me to join you tonight.

00:16:14.724 --> 00:16:16.393 align:middle
'Course! See you tomorrow!

00:16:16.476 --> 00:16:17.519 align:middle
Yeah, see ya.

00:16:17.602 --> 00:16:20.021 align:middle
Okay, good night, you guys.

00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:31.116 align:middle
I made them worry about me.

00:16:32.575 --> 00:16:34.119 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Wait, hold on!

00:16:34.202 --> 00:16:36.287 align:middle
Where's my commuter pass?

00:16:36.371 --> 00:16:39.958 align:middle
Oh man, I must've
left it at the office.

00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:47.257 align:middle
This is great, I'm not scared!

00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:48.550 align:middle
'Cause I'm an adult!

00:16:48.633 --> 00:16:51.428 align:middle
And as such,
I am not scared of anything!

00:16:56.266 --> 00:16:57.559 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Hey.

00:16:58.351 --> 00:17:04.858 align:middle
[TAKEDA snoring]

00:17:04.941 --> 00:17:06.109 align:middle
[FUTABA] This is the
first time I've ever seen

00:17:06.192 --> 00:17:09.362 align:middle
Mister Takeda
asleep at his desk.

00:17:09.446 --> 00:17:10.739 align:middle
[gasps]

00:17:10.822 --> 00:17:12.323 align:middle
Hey, that's...

00:17:12.407 --> 00:17:15.660 align:middle
This is the purchase
order I messed up.

00:17:18.288 --> 00:17:20.248 align:middle
I don't get it.

00:17:20.331 --> 00:17:21.374 align:middle
Why are you being so nice

00:17:21.458 --> 00:17:24.419 align:middle
to a little underling
like me, anyway?

00:17:31.926 --> 00:17:33.720 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Huh?

00:17:33.803 --> 00:17:35.638 align:middle
[grunts]

00:17:35.722 --> 00:17:38.350 align:middle
Oh, wow. I fell asleep.

00:17:40.435 --> 00:17:41.811 align:middle
Huh?

00:17:41.895 --> 00:17:44.272 align:middle
Igarashi came by?

00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:47.609 align:middle
The purchase order
was sitting right here.

00:17:47.692 --> 00:17:50.695 align:middle
I suppose she must've seen it.

00:17:50.779 --> 00:17:52.530 align:middle
Huh?

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:57.786 align:middle
[phone rings]

00:17:57.869 --> 00:18:00.413 align:middle
Hello. Itomaki Trading.

00:18:00.497 --> 00:18:04.125 align:middle
Yes. Sure, just one sec!

00:18:04.209 --> 00:18:05.210 align:middle
Takeda!

00:18:05.293 --> 00:18:06.544 align:middle
I just finished the estimate.

00:18:06.628 --> 00:18:08.088 align:middle
Take a look?

00:18:09.422 --> 00:18:10.632 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Yes. I see.

00:18:10.715 --> 00:18:12.133 align:middle
Thank goodness.

00:18:12.217 --> 00:18:14.969 align:middle
It feels better when Futaba's
her normal, chipper self.

00:18:17.806 --> 00:18:19.182 align:middle
Yeah, you're right.

00:18:32.862 --> 00:18:35.865 align:middle
[FUTABA] Please look it over
and let me know what you think!

00:18:39.619 --> 00:18:42.997 align:middle
Mm! Isn't this a wonderful idea?

00:18:43.081 --> 00:18:45.000 align:middle
Not only did you
rectify the error,

00:18:45.083 --> 00:18:47.002 align:middle
you proposed a fresh,
new sales plan,

00:18:47.085 --> 00:18:49.212 align:middle
and we really appreciate that.

00:18:49.295 --> 00:18:51.506 align:middle
Let's proceed with this.

00:18:56.678 --> 00:18:58.763 align:middle
Thank you so much, sir!

00:19:01.099 --> 00:19:03.518 align:middle
[TAKEDA] The client was
really pleased with you.

00:19:04.269 --> 00:19:05.854 align:middle
What a great feeling, right?

00:19:05.937 --> 00:19:08.106 align:middle
[laughs]

00:19:08.189 --> 00:19:10.859 align:middle
Hmm? Igarashi?

00:19:12.402 --> 00:19:13.903 align:middle
I feel terrible!

00:19:13.987 --> 00:19:17.282 align:middle
I can't tell you how sorry I am
for all the trouble I caused!

00:19:17.365 --> 00:19:21.536 align:middle
I guess. I have a long way
to go before I'm full-fledged.

00:19:21.619 --> 00:19:24.622 align:middle
Hey, relax.
Don't worry about it!

00:19:24.706 --> 00:19:27.917 align:middle
You've already made up for
your mistake, haven't you?

00:19:29.461 --> 00:19:31.546 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
You did a great job.

00:19:34.049 --> 00:19:35.633 align:middle
That doesn't make sense.

00:19:35.717 --> 00:19:38.345 align:middle
You can't say that.

00:19:38.428 --> 00:19:41.097 align:middle
Come on, let me
buy you a bowl of udon.

00:19:41.181 --> 00:19:43.641 align:middle
[TAKEDA] While I like
a good bowl of udon...

00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:48.480 align:middle
[TAKEDA] Nothing beats raising
our glasses to a job well-done!

00:19:48.563 --> 00:19:50.065 align:middle
Listen, tonight I'm buying!

00:19:50.148 --> 00:19:51.191 align:middle
No "buts"!

00:19:51.274 --> 00:19:53.610 align:middle
And you should order
whatever you want!

00:19:53.693 --> 00:19:54.861 align:middle
That's ridiculous!

00:19:54.944 --> 00:19:57.655 align:middle
I was the one who
got us into trouble.

00:19:57.739 --> 00:20:00.367 align:middle
I just can't let you
treat me to this, sir.

00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:03.161 align:middle
But think about it, in the end,
we still got the contract,

00:20:03.244 --> 00:20:04.579 align:middle
so does it really
make a difference?

00:20:04.662 --> 00:20:06.831 align:middle
Of course it does!

00:20:06.915 --> 00:20:08.166 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
You're my subordinate.

00:20:08.249 --> 00:20:10.126 align:middle
Just let me treat you.

00:20:10.377 --> 00:20:11.795 align:middle
[FUTABA dissatisfied]
Hmm....

00:20:11.878 --> 00:20:13.672 align:middle
[WAITRESS] Evening, folks!
What'll you have?

00:20:13.755 --> 00:20:15.006 align:middle
Well, for starters...

00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:17.092 align:middle
...we'll have beer!

00:20:20.053 --> 00:20:22.847 align:middle
Ahh... Honestly!

00:20:22.931 --> 00:20:25.433 align:middle
I can't believe I made
such a simple mistake.

00:20:25.517 --> 00:20:27.560 align:middle
I'm so disappointed in me.

00:20:27.644 --> 00:20:29.938 align:middle
[laughs]

00:20:30.021 --> 00:20:30.855 align:middle
Hey, mister!

00:20:30.939 --> 00:20:33.566 align:middle
You enjoying this or what?

00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:35.985 align:middle
Oh, never mind, you should.

00:20:36.069 --> 00:20:37.320 align:middle
Fine, go ahead and laugh!

00:20:37.404 --> 00:20:39.322 align:middle
Chew me out for being so stupid

00:20:39.406 --> 00:20:44.452 align:middle
in spite of having two years
of sales experience!

00:20:44.536 --> 00:20:46.454 align:middle
I'm not gonna chew you out.

00:20:46.538 --> 00:20:48.790 align:middle
Sure, messing up may
have gotten you down,

00:20:48.873 --> 00:20:51.459 align:middle
but you worked hard
and followed through.

00:20:51.543 --> 00:20:53.586 align:middle
You'll make a good salesperson.

00:20:57.716 --> 00:21:00.927 align:middle
[FUTABA]
What? Why...

00:21:01.011 --> 00:21:05.223 align:middle
Why are you being so nice
to a junior nothin' like me?

00:21:06.641 --> 00:21:08.059 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Holy crap!

00:21:08.143 --> 00:21:09.769 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Hm?

00:21:09.853 --> 00:21:13.398 align:middle
Well, I mean, I didn't know.

00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:21.072 align:middle
Look, I just realized
you must really like me,

00:21:21.156 --> 00:21:23.408 align:middle
and it's freaking me out!

00:21:24.242 --> 00:21:27.037 align:middle
Hey! Well, of course
I like you, silly.

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:28.997 align:middle
Uh.

00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:30.206 align:middle
As a matter of fact,

00:21:30.290 --> 00:21:32.667 align:middle
if I ever end up having
a wife and a child,

00:21:32.751 --> 00:21:35.003 align:middle
I'd want that kid
to be just like you.

00:21:37.172 --> 00:21:38.173 align:middle
[blink, blink]

00:21:38.256 --> 00:21:40.508 align:middle
What's that supposed to mean?

00:21:43.428 --> 00:21:45.680 align:middle
[laughs]

00:21:45.764 --> 00:21:47.265 align:middle
Sorry, I know.

00:21:47.349 --> 00:21:51.144 align:middle
But for some weird reason
I feel like looking after you.

00:21:51.227 --> 00:21:54.647 align:middle
[FUTABA groans] Why would
I have to be the child?

00:21:54.731 --> 00:21:57.192 align:middle
Huh? What'd you say?

00:22:01.363 --> 00:22:05.700 align:middle
I don't get it.
Why couldn't I be your wife?

00:22:09.996 --> 00:22:11.498 align:middle
[gasps]

00:22:14.876 --> 00:22:15.919 align:middle
[FUTABA]
What the heck am I saying?

00:22:16.002 --> 00:22:19.964 align:middle
Oh no, how do I fix this?

00:22:20.048 --> 00:22:23.968 align:middle
What should I do?
What should I do?
