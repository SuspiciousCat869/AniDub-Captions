WEBVTT

00:01:08.542 --> 00:01:09.959
Huh?

00:01:15.208 --> 00:01:16.083
[BOY B]
We did it!

00:01:16.166 --> 00:01:18.917
We're the best! Yeah!

00:02:58.875 --> 00:02:59.834
[SAKURAI]
Hey, thanks so much

00:02:59.917 --> 00:03:01.959
for helping Yuto
out the other day.

00:03:02.041 --> 00:03:03.208
[FUTABA]
Oh, no prob.

00:03:03.291 --> 00:03:04.542
He's always getting lost.

00:03:04.625 --> 00:03:06.959
It's been, like,
a regular thing lately!

00:03:07.041 --> 00:03:09.250
Come on! Did you have
to say it out loud?

00:03:09.333 --> 00:03:11.583
And thanks to you too, Natsumi.

00:03:11.667 --> 00:03:13.166
Sure.

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:14.417
Seriously.

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.750
It's impossible to thank
you two enough for this!

00:03:16.834 --> 00:03:18.750
[chuckles]
No worries, kid.

00:03:18.834 --> 00:03:20.583
[WAITRESS]
I'm sorry about the wait.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.208
Oh, wow! This looks good!

00:03:31.208 --> 00:03:33.583
My cheeks are
falling off, you guys!

00:03:37.375 --> 00:03:39.500
Huh, okay, uh...

00:03:39.583 --> 00:03:40.834
What are you trying to do, here?

00:03:40.917 --> 00:03:43.959
[NATSUMI] Well, I'm saving
your cheeks, of course.

00:03:44.041 --> 00:03:45.834
You know
I didn't mean it literally.

00:03:45.917 --> 00:03:49.166
[SAKURAI] Aw, no fair!
I wanna pinch 'em, too!

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:50.583
Okay, quit, that's enough!

00:03:50.667 --> 00:03:53.417
[YUTO laughs]
You two are pretty close, huh?

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:54.583
Yeah, that's what happens

00:03:54.667 --> 00:03:56.417
when you've been friends
since junior high.

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.792
[YUTO]
Oh, wow!

00:03:58.875 --> 00:04:01.709
I did get the worst first
impression of her, though.

00:04:01.792 --> 00:04:02.750
Really? You did?

00:04:02.834 --> 00:04:04.041
Are you kidding me?

00:04:04.125 --> 00:04:06.250
[YUTO] I'd love to
hear more about that.

00:04:06.333 --> 00:04:08.250
[FUTABA]
Hmm...

00:04:08.333 --> 00:04:09.875
Ahem!

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:11.166
I'll never forget that spring.

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:12.792
My first year in junior high.

00:04:12.875 --> 00:04:13.875
[NATSUMI]
Huh?

00:04:17.417 --> 00:04:19.041
[FUTABA]
What should I do?

00:04:19.125 --> 00:04:22.875
Why is the thing bouncing
all over the place like that?

00:04:22.959 --> 00:04:25.709
I can't be late on my
first day at a new school!

00:04:25.792 --> 00:04:29.458
Oh, man, what am
I supposed to do?

00:04:29.542 --> 00:04:31.709
Uh, sorry!

00:04:34.333 --> 00:04:36.625
[FUTABA]
She looks scary!

00:04:36.709 --> 00:04:39.083
But she is wearing
my school's uniform.

00:04:39.166 --> 00:04:42.583
So, I guess
I'll just follow her.

00:04:51.041 --> 00:04:53.583
[FUTABA]
Huh?

00:04:53.667 --> 00:04:55.125
Huh?!

00:04:55.208 --> 00:04:57.542
Hey! Wait up, wouldja?

00:04:57.625 --> 00:05:00.250
Tell me why you're running away!

00:05:00.333 --> 00:05:01.417
Please, wait!

00:05:15.583 --> 00:05:17.709
Dude, how are you this fast?

00:05:18.166 --> 00:05:19.458
[NATSUMI]
Hm...

00:05:19.542 --> 00:05:22.417
Tell me why you're following me.

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.625
Because I got lost, that's why.

00:05:24.709 --> 00:05:27.250
So, would you mind
if I kept following you?

00:05:27.333 --> 00:05:28.792
[NATSUMI]
Hm...

00:05:28.875 --> 00:05:31.041
Sure, fine. Whatever.

00:05:35.375 --> 00:05:39.750
[FUTABA] She doesn't seem
like a bad person or anything.

00:05:39.834 --> 00:05:43.250
And she's got
such a nice figure.

00:05:43.333 --> 00:05:45.000
She's pretty, too.

00:05:45.083 --> 00:05:46.667
[sighs]

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:48.917
So, compared to her, I'm...

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.417
Hey, wait. How old are you?

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:54.542
Oh, 13, actually, so...

00:05:55.667 --> 00:05:57.000
Huh?

00:05:57.083 --> 00:05:59.125
No way. You're older than me?

00:05:59.208 --> 00:06:00.417
Huh?

00:06:03.375 --> 00:06:04.542
[NATSUMI]
That's wild.

00:06:04.625 --> 00:06:06.208
We're both in the same grade.

00:06:06.291 --> 00:06:08.417
You're so short
I thought you were younger.

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:09.834
Seriously?

00:06:09.917 --> 00:06:12.083
Yeah, I'm short, but you
should never judge people

00:06:12.166 --> 00:06:13.667
by the way they look!

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:15.583
Sorry for that.

00:06:15.667 --> 00:06:17.542
It just seems like
I should've noticed you.

00:06:17.625 --> 00:06:20.417
Someone so short at
that entrance ceremony.

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:23.583
[FUTABA] Well, actually, I only
just transferred here today.

00:06:23.667 --> 00:06:24.667
Oh, really?

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:26.291
Guess that's why you got lost.

00:06:26.375 --> 00:06:29.458
To be honest, I didn't know
exactly what to do at first,

00:06:29.542 --> 00:06:32.333
but you've been really kind,
so, thank you.

00:06:32.417 --> 00:06:33.792
[NATSUMI]
I've got a name, you know.

00:06:33.875 --> 00:06:34.959
Huh?

00:06:35.041 --> 00:06:36.583
Just call me Natsumi.

00:06:36.667 --> 00:06:37.792
Natsumi Kurobe.

00:06:37.875 --> 00:06:39.166
What's your name?

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:41.834
I'm Futaba Igarashi.

00:06:41.917 --> 00:06:43.667
It's nice to meet you.

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:45.917
Yeah. I feel the same.

00:06:46.792 --> 00:06:49.375
[FUTABA] She's really cute
when she smiles.

00:06:52.208 --> 00:06:53.000
Well, here we are.

00:06:53.083 --> 00:06:54.875
Ahh...

00:06:59.875 --> 00:07:01.333
This is an arcade.

00:07:01.417 --> 00:07:02.375
[NATSUMI]
Mm-hmm.

00:07:02.458 --> 00:07:03.834
What about school?

00:07:03.917 --> 00:07:06.917
Listen, I never said that's
where I was going, did I?

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.083
I plan to ditch
the whole day. See ya!

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:17.000
[NATSUMI laughs]

00:07:17.083 --> 00:07:18.583
[FUTABA] She made me
way late for the first day

00:07:18.667 --> 00:07:20.125
at my new school!

00:07:20.208 --> 00:07:21.375
Yeah.

00:07:21.458 --> 00:07:23.375
I do remember something
like that happening--

00:07:23.458 --> 00:07:24.709
That's because it happened!

00:07:24.792 --> 00:07:27.583
[YUTO laughs]

00:07:27.667 --> 00:07:30.834
No doubt about it, the two
of you really are crazy-close!

00:07:30.917 --> 00:07:32.375
[FUTABA]
Hmm?

00:07:32.458 --> 00:07:33.583
Ahem!

00:07:33.667 --> 00:07:36.417
Well, yeah,
I guess we couldn't help it.

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:38.792
Tell us, was she
always this adorable?

00:07:38.875 --> 00:07:40.375
Oh, you bet!

00:07:40.458 --> 00:07:43.083
You do realize I'm sitting
within earshot, right?

00:07:46.834 --> 00:07:48.583
[FUTABA]
Hmm?

00:07:48.667 --> 00:07:50.083
Hey, what're you looking at?

00:07:50.166 --> 00:07:51.333
Hey!

00:07:51.417 --> 00:07:53.208
You know this month's
blossom viewing party?

00:07:53.291 --> 00:07:54.458
This is who's doing what.

00:07:54.542 --> 00:07:55.542
[FUTABA]
Oh, right.

00:07:55.625 --> 00:07:57.667
It's that time of
year already, huh?

00:07:57.750 --> 00:07:59.959
[TAKEDA] I'm taking
care of saving a spot.

00:08:00.041 --> 00:08:02.417
I can do that if you'd
like me to, y'know.

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:03.709
Huh?

00:08:03.792 --> 00:08:04.750
This is the kind of thing
you should delegate

00:08:04.834 --> 00:08:06.417
to your underling.

00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:07.959
Interesting.

00:08:08.041 --> 00:08:10.333
Okay then, let's both do it!

00:08:12.166 --> 00:08:15.709
Well, yeah, if you're more
okay with that, I guess.

00:08:15.792 --> 00:08:16.834
[CHIEF]
Hey, Takeda!

00:08:16.917 --> 00:08:18.458
Could you come
here for a second?

00:08:18.542 --> 00:08:20.000
Sure.

00:08:41.583 --> 00:08:42.625
Huh?

00:08:52.291 --> 00:08:54.166
[groans]

00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:56.542
I'm so exhausted.

00:08:57.709 --> 00:08:58.750
[NATSUMI]
Yuto?

00:09:00.333 --> 00:09:01.208
[YUTO]
Kurobe!

00:09:01.291 --> 00:09:02.333
Small world, huh?

00:09:02.417 --> 00:09:04.291
You always been a runner?

00:09:07.208 --> 00:09:09.792
Ah, long-distance running.

00:09:09.875 --> 00:09:11.542
Brings back memories.

00:09:11.625 --> 00:09:12.750
That's right.

00:09:12.834 --> 00:09:15.500
We keep track of
our times based on pairings.

00:09:15.583 --> 00:09:18.542
But I'm the only guy who's
paired up with a girl, so...

00:09:18.625 --> 00:09:21.834
Now I get it, you don't
want to look uncool, huh?

00:09:28.125 --> 00:09:30.417
Kurobe, why the heck
do you feel like you need

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:33.000
to talk while we're running?

00:09:33.083 --> 00:09:36.000
[NATSUMI]
Sorry, that was on purpose.

00:09:36.083 --> 00:09:38.750
[YUTO] How come you have
so much stamina, anyway?

00:09:41.709 --> 00:09:43.667
I guess because
I did track and field.

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:45.875
Oh! Wow, that's awesome!

00:09:45.959 --> 00:09:48.250
I'm not any good at exercising.

00:09:48.333 --> 00:09:51.083
You keep at it, though,
and that's commendable.

00:09:55.542 --> 00:09:58.500
The thing with me is,

00:09:58.583 --> 00:10:01.291
I just like to run, that's all.

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:06.917
[NATSUMI] Isn't there something
you like to do, Yuto?

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.583
Huh? Um. I guess, I've always
liked to play basketball.

00:10:11.667 --> 00:10:14.250
But it's pretty shocking
how bad I am at it.

00:10:14.333 --> 00:10:16.417
What about joining
the basketball club?

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:18.291
I'd like to, but it's just...

00:10:18.375 --> 00:10:21.917
I'm pretty sure
I'd only get in the way.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.542
[NATSUMI]
But you like it?

00:10:24.625 --> 00:10:26.041
Give it a shot, then.

00:10:26.125 --> 00:10:27.417
I think you should do it.

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:29.834
Then you won't have
anything to regret later on.

00:10:29.917 --> 00:10:31.000
It goes so fast.

00:10:31.083 --> 00:10:33.166
Life as a student
is over in no time.

00:10:40.208 --> 00:10:45.709
[sighs]

00:10:45.792 --> 00:10:47.875
Oh, junior high.

00:10:51.959 --> 00:10:54.667
Turn in your club application
before you leave school today.

00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:55.875
Is that understood?

00:10:55.959 --> 00:10:57.417
[STUDENTS]
Yes, ma'am.

00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:00.333
[NATSUMI whistling]

00:11:00.417 --> 00:11:01.875
Hey, whistling's bad manners.

00:11:01.959 --> 00:11:03.917
Cut it out.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.875
[NATSUMI]
Hmm...

00:11:05.959 --> 00:11:07.583
What club are you
planning to join?

00:11:07.667 --> 00:11:09.667
[FUTABA]
Huh? Me?

00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:12.709
Oh, that's easy.

00:11:12.792 --> 00:11:14.000
It's the art club!

00:11:14.083 --> 00:11:16.125
I've always liked to draw.

00:11:19.333 --> 00:11:20.709
What about you, Natsumi?

00:11:20.792 --> 00:11:21.709
Track and field?

00:11:21.792 --> 00:11:23.125
Wait, what?

00:11:23.208 --> 00:11:24.458
But why would I do that?

00:11:24.542 --> 00:11:26.875
Because it's obvious
you're a fast runner.

00:11:26.959 --> 00:11:29.959
I mean, don't you like to run?

00:11:30.041 --> 00:11:34.291
[NATSUMI]
It isn't that. It's just...

00:11:39.417 --> 00:11:41.208
[NATSUMI]
I hate competitions.

00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:46.834
[FUTABA] But the point is,
you like doing it, right?

00:11:46.917 --> 00:11:50.834
Well, then, why don't you just
run for your own sake, silly?

00:11:55.792 --> 00:11:57.750
It's "Igarashi," right?

00:11:57.834 --> 00:11:59.667
I'm think I'm just gonna pick
some random club,

00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:01.375
then hit the arcade.

00:12:01.458 --> 00:12:03.250
[FUTABA] You're really not
supposed to ditch school,

00:12:03.333 --> 00:12:04.750
you know.

00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:11.250
Pretty magnificent, isn't it?

00:12:11.333 --> 00:12:14.834
Yeah, it really is.

00:12:14.917 --> 00:12:16.875
But of course,
two weeks from now,

00:12:16.959 --> 00:12:19.250
the cherries'll have
fresh green leaves.

00:12:19.333 --> 00:12:20.333
Is that a bad thing?

00:12:20.417 --> 00:12:22.000
[FUTABA]
Hmm?

00:12:22.083 --> 00:12:23.417
I dunno if it's bad,

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:25.750
but don't you think that green
is plainer than pink?

00:12:25.834 --> 00:12:27.208
I wouldn't say that.

00:12:27.291 --> 00:12:30.667
Green happens to be a very
pretty color, if you ask me.

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:33.250
[FUTABA]
Green's pretty?

00:12:33.333 --> 00:12:35.375
Oh. Really?

00:12:35.458 --> 00:12:37.542
Well, yeah, I mean,
it's my natural hair color,

00:12:37.625 --> 00:12:40.500
so I try to keep it looking
as good as I can, I guess,

00:12:40.583 --> 00:12:42.208
but it can be
interesting to deal with.

00:12:42.291 --> 00:12:44.625
[TAKEDA] Huh? I was talking
about the cherry trees.

00:12:44.709 --> 00:12:48.041
[FUTABA]
Huh? Oh, right.

00:12:48.125 --> 00:12:51.792
[TAKEDA chuckles nervously]
Well, if I'm honest,

00:12:51.875 --> 00:12:54.917
I don't know all that much about
beauty or anything, but...

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.834
...what I do know is,
I like your hair!

00:13:01.375 --> 00:13:02.709
[TAKEDA]
It smells nice, too.

00:13:02.792 --> 00:13:05.583
[gasps]
You! You perv!

00:13:05.667 --> 00:13:06.750
Huh?

00:13:06.834 --> 00:13:07.750
[FUTABA]
I mean, what the heck?

00:13:07.834 --> 00:13:10.041
Have you always sniffed me?

00:13:10.125 --> 00:13:11.375
Course not!

00:13:11.458 --> 00:13:13.166
When you work with someone
as closely as we have,

00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:15.000
you smell them
without meaning to!

00:13:26.166 --> 00:13:28.291
[CHIEF] Tonight, your good
conduct has been rewarded

00:13:28.375 --> 00:13:30.166
with the cherry blossoms
in full bloom.

00:13:30.250 --> 00:13:32.166
Thanks for all your hard work.

00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:35.542
So, I say we all let our hair
down and have a good time.

00:13:35.625 --> 00:13:38.166
Yes? Cheers! Enjoy!

00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:39.750
[EMPLOYEES]
Cheers!

00:13:41.125 --> 00:13:44.166
Please try some, if you like.

00:13:44.250 --> 00:13:45.250
[TSUKISHIRO]
Those look good.

00:13:45.333 --> 00:13:46.583
Did you make them yourself?

00:13:46.667 --> 00:13:49.750
[FUTABA] Yes, but I'm
not sure you'll like them.

00:13:54.875 --> 00:13:56.125
My gosh.

00:13:56.208 --> 00:13:58.583
You're such a good cook,
Igarashi, these are great.

00:13:58.667 --> 00:14:00.542
Oh, c'mon. Look,
there's plenty more,

00:14:00.625 --> 00:14:02.875
so please feel free
to help yourself.

00:14:02.959 --> 00:14:05.291
Beer tastes the best outdoors,
don't you think?

00:14:05.375 --> 00:14:06.792
It sure does.

00:14:06.875 --> 00:14:08.041
Ta-da!

00:14:08.125 --> 00:14:09.917
There's lots of other
good stuff here, too.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.208
[TAKEDA]
Oh, wow!

00:14:11.291 --> 00:14:12.875
[HIJIKATA]
Ooishi, come drink with us!

00:14:12.959 --> 00:14:14.542
I'm fine, really.

00:14:14.625 --> 00:14:16.792
Oh, come on now,
we gotta party tonight!

00:14:16.875 --> 00:14:17.959
Uh...

00:14:18.041 --> 00:14:20.333
Hey, don't force it
on him or anything.

00:14:23.125 --> 00:14:23.875
Here.

00:14:23.959 --> 00:14:24.959
Thank you so much!

00:14:25.041 --> 00:14:26.333
This looks good!

00:14:26.417 --> 00:14:27.625
Yeah.

00:14:27.709 --> 00:14:29.375
[SAKURAI] Got enough beer?
I'll pour you some.

00:14:29.458 --> 00:14:31.291
[KAZAMA]
Oh, thanks.

00:14:36.041 --> 00:14:38.709
Shall I guess which direction
you're looking right now?

00:14:38.792 --> 00:14:39.750
[KAZAMA]
No, please don't.

00:14:49.250 --> 00:14:50.458
[OOISHI]
Hey, Chief!

00:14:50.542 --> 00:14:53.417
What song are you singing?

00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:54.875
Can't ya...
[hiccup]

00:14:54.959 --> 00:14:56.834
...sing it with
a little more soul?

00:14:56.917 --> 00:14:59.291
'Cause we all deserve
at least that much!

00:14:59.375 --> 00:15:01.458
[CHIEF] Wow, Ooishi,
you're like a different person

00:15:01.542 --> 00:15:03.166
when you're drunk, huh?

00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:04.583
Hey, listen!

00:15:04.667 --> 00:15:07.291
A song's gotta have soul
or it's not a song at all.

00:15:07.375 --> 00:15:09.750
Soul! Soul!

00:15:09.834 --> 00:15:11.208
What are you doing, stupid?

00:15:11.291 --> 00:15:12.375
Hey, stay outta this!

00:15:12.458 --> 00:15:13.709
The fun's about to start.

00:15:13.792 --> 00:15:17.041
[HIJIKATA]
I'm so, so sorry!

00:15:17.125 --> 00:15:19.834
Tell me, was Ooishi
always like that?

00:15:19.917 --> 00:15:23.542
I heard he was in the
pop music club as a student.

00:15:23.625 --> 00:15:26.333
How 'bout you? Which club?

00:15:26.417 --> 00:15:27.709
I was in the art club.

00:15:27.792 --> 00:15:31.709
Oh! That's right, I remember
that bear you drew me.

00:15:31.792 --> 00:15:33.083
I thought that was great!

00:15:33.166 --> 00:15:36.166
Hey, now, don't
try to flatter me!

00:15:36.250 --> 00:15:37.959
I wasn't just being polite.

00:15:38.041 --> 00:15:39.875
You like to draw, don't ya'?

00:15:39.959 --> 00:15:42.041
So, be confident in that.

00:15:42.125 --> 00:15:43.166
I think being passionate

00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:46.625
about something is
a fine gift to have.

00:15:48.458 --> 00:15:52.000
A friend said something similar
to me, way back in the day.

00:15:52.083 --> 00:15:54.041
We've been friends
since we were kids.

00:15:54.125 --> 00:15:57.709
And we both live here in Tokyo,
so we still hang out a lot.

00:15:57.792 --> 00:15:59.250
Ahhh...

00:15:59.333 --> 00:16:02.000
I bet she's the one in that
picture you've got in your room!

00:16:02.083 --> 00:16:05.417
Picture? How do you
know about that?

00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:06.500
'Cause I was at your place

00:16:06.583 --> 00:16:08.083
when you were sick
in bed, remember?

00:16:08.166 --> 00:16:09.333
That's how--

00:16:11.166 --> 00:16:12.291
[FUTABA]
Well, you're actually right

00:16:12.375 --> 00:16:14.583
about the girl in the picture.

00:16:14.667 --> 00:16:16.375
Her name is Natsumi
and it's because of her

00:16:16.458 --> 00:16:18.583
that I still like to draw.

00:16:18.667 --> 00:16:20.417
Did something happen?

00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:23.792
[sighs] Oh, you know,
just this and that.

00:16:23.875 --> 00:16:25.417
Come on, gimme the scoop.

00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:27.208
I'm all ears.

00:16:27.291 --> 00:16:29.750
Well, if you really insist.

00:16:31.542 --> 00:16:32.917
Hey, check it out.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:34.458
Huh?

00:16:34.542 --> 00:16:35.834
Yo, Igarashi!

00:16:35.917 --> 00:16:37.917
Ah! What do you want?

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.625
Whatcha drawing over there?

00:16:39.709 --> 00:16:40.834
Come on, show us!

00:16:40.917 --> 00:16:43.166
[FUTABA]
Uh, well, that's...

00:16:45.917 --> 00:16:47.875
[BOY G]
What is this?

00:16:47.959 --> 00:16:49.959
A bear.

00:16:50.041 --> 00:16:53.333
[laughing]

00:16:53.417 --> 00:16:54.709
For real?

00:16:54.792 --> 00:16:56.375
It looks more like a pig!

00:16:57.125 --> 00:17:00.083
If you're done now,
then give it back.

00:17:00.166 --> 00:17:01.667
Hey, I've got it!

00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:04.333
Why don'tcha let us
draw something?

00:17:07.417 --> 00:17:08.875
No! Please give it back!

00:17:08.959 --> 00:17:10.542
It's really important to me!

00:17:10.625 --> 00:17:11.792
Hey, calm down!

00:17:11.875 --> 00:17:14.041
Don't get all serious on us.

00:17:14.125 --> 00:17:15.291
--Please!
--What's wrong?

00:17:15.375 --> 00:17:17.750
All we wanna do is
draw a picture, too.

00:17:20.250 --> 00:17:23.041
Huh? Wait, are you crying?

00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:31.000
[STUDENT A]
What was that?

00:17:31.083 --> 00:17:33.000
[STUDENT B] That's the girl
who's always tardy.

00:17:33.083 --> 00:17:34.625
[STUDENT E]
This is not good.

00:17:34.709 --> 00:17:36.917
[STUDENT C]
Somebody, go get the teacher.

00:17:38.208 --> 00:17:41.208
[NATSUMI]
Igarashi. Here you go.

00:17:41.291 --> 00:17:43.583
It's important to you, right?

00:17:44.959 --> 00:17:47.875
[NATSUMI] Stop giving her
a hard time, you hear me?

00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:55.375
[BOY G]
Oh man, you can't be serious!

00:17:55.458 --> 00:17:57.750
[BOY F]
Hey, I think you'd better stop.

00:17:57.834 --> 00:18:00.208
Igarashi, you're really
joining the art club

00:18:00.291 --> 00:18:02.750
even though your drawing stinks?

00:18:10.625 --> 00:18:12.333
[STUDENT D]
Is he all right?

00:18:14.250 --> 00:18:15.917
[NATSUMI]
Shut your big, fat mouth.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:17.500
Huh?!

00:18:17.583 --> 00:18:20.125
Igarashi can join
whatever club she wants.

00:18:20.208 --> 00:18:21.792
No matter what!

00:18:21.875 --> 00:18:25.083
She's doing it because
she actually likes to draw!

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.166
What is this?

00:18:37.250 --> 00:18:39.792
Just what do you guys
think you're doing?

00:18:45.458 --> 00:18:48.375
[FUTABA] I sure hope
Natsumi's doing okay.

00:18:48.458 --> 00:18:49.250
[BOY G]
Igarashi.

00:18:49.333 --> 00:18:53.959
Uh! Yes? What is it?

00:18:54.041 --> 00:18:55.625
At first, all we
really wanted to do

00:18:55.709 --> 00:18:58.000
was give you a
bit of a hard time.

00:18:58.083 --> 00:18:59.041
We didn't realize your notebook

00:18:59.125 --> 00:19:02.583
was important
enough to cry over.

00:19:02.667 --> 00:19:05.792
Anyhow, now we're
joining the baseball club.

00:19:05.875 --> 00:19:09.333
But we're only joining
because we both like it so much.

00:19:09.417 --> 00:19:12.875
But the fact is,
we both seriously suck at it.

00:19:13.959 --> 00:19:16.750
[BOY G]
So, when Kurobe punched me,

00:19:16.834 --> 00:19:19.834
I realized what
I said was pretty mean.

00:19:19.917 --> 00:19:21.208
I'm really sorry
for getting worked up

00:19:21.291 --> 00:19:22.959
and saying those stupid things.

00:19:23.041 --> 00:19:24.291
[BOY F]
Me, too.

00:19:29.458 --> 00:19:30.792
[FUTABA]
Natsumi!

00:19:32.083 --> 00:19:33.792
What is it? You all right?

00:19:33.875 --> 00:19:35.333
Sure, I'm good.

00:19:35.417 --> 00:19:36.667
Those boys, however,

00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:38.041
they told the teacher
what happened,

00:19:38.125 --> 00:19:40.083
so that could be bad.

00:19:40.166 --> 00:19:43.166
But I was the one who
knocked that chair over.

00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:45.917
I'm the one who
obviously started the fight.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.750
Just don't go punching
anyone else, 'kay?

00:19:48.834 --> 00:19:52.583
[NATSUMI] Well, I'm glad
you're all right, Igarashi.

00:19:53.667 --> 00:19:55.959
[FUTABA]
Natsumi, if it's okay with you,

00:19:56.041 --> 00:19:59.000
I'd really like it if you'd
call me Futaba from now on.

00:19:59.083 --> 00:20:00.375
Huh?!

00:20:00.458 --> 00:20:01.750
[FUTABA]
Is that a no?

00:20:01.834 --> 00:20:03.792
Uh, okay, sure.

00:20:06.709 --> 00:20:09.083
You can keep calling me
Natsumi like you already do.

00:20:09.166 --> 00:20:13.000
Yep! Done!

00:20:13.083 --> 00:20:14.709
--Natsumi!
--Futaba!

00:20:18.417 --> 00:20:20.500
Okay, I'm gonna head home.

00:20:20.583 --> 00:20:22.959
Hey, wait a sec!

00:20:23.041 --> 00:20:26.041
Um, if you don't want to,
it's totally okay.

00:20:26.125 --> 00:20:28.709
But will you join
the art club with me?

00:20:28.792 --> 00:20:30.208
Huh?

00:20:30.291 --> 00:20:32.709
[FUTABA] I thought it'd be
more fun if you were there, too,

00:20:32.792 --> 00:20:34.709
that's all.

00:20:34.792 --> 00:20:35.959
[NATSUMI]
Sorry, Futaba.

00:20:36.041 --> 00:20:38.125
I just turned in
my club application.

00:20:38.208 --> 00:20:41.333
Huh? Which one did you pick?

00:20:41.417 --> 00:20:42.667
[NATSUMI]
Track and field.

00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:45.750
Oh... Why do that?

00:20:45.834 --> 00:20:47.458
Well, because...

00:20:47.542 --> 00:20:49.875
...running's just the best.

00:20:53.125 --> 00:20:54.625
[FUTABA ]
That's her.

00:20:54.709 --> 00:20:57.000
She taught me how to have
the courage to do what I like,

00:20:57.083 --> 00:20:58.458
no matter what.

00:20:59.667 --> 00:21:03.125
So, when I was feeling anxious
about coming to Tokyo by myself,

00:21:03.208 --> 00:21:07.041
I just tried to remember
what she said to me that day.

00:21:08.250 --> 00:21:10.625
Natsumi really is a great gal.

00:21:13.625 --> 00:21:16.500
Hey, could you draw me
something else sometime?

00:21:16.583 --> 00:21:20.041
I mean, again, I don't know
anything about art stuff,

00:21:20.125 --> 00:21:22.083
but I really do
like your pictures.

00:21:22.166 --> 00:21:25.667
Oh. Okay, I will.

00:21:26.834 --> 00:21:28.750
--[OOISHI] Love and soul!
--[TSUKISHIRO] Soul!

00:21:28.834 --> 00:21:31.083
--[OOISHI] Love and soul!
--[TSUKISHIRO] Soul!

00:21:31.166 --> 00:21:32.333
--[OOISHI] Love and...

00:21:32.417 --> 00:21:33.417
You guys, come on!

00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:34.709
Knock it off now!

00:21:34.792 --> 00:21:36.333
Great, my ears are ringing.

00:21:36.417 --> 00:21:38.625
Who let them drink that much?

00:21:38.709 --> 00:21:40.083
That was a bad idea!

00:21:40.166 --> 00:21:41.834
--[OOISHI] Love and soul!
--[TSUKISHIRO] Soul!

00:23:17.834 --> 00:23:19.959
Ah. Hey, Natsumi!

00:23:20.041 --> 00:23:22.792
Oh, thanks for chatting before.

00:23:24.542 --> 00:23:26.166
Do you come here often?

00:23:26.250 --> 00:23:28.792
Yeah, 'cause it's
really close to work.

00:23:28.875 --> 00:23:30.375
How's Yuto been doing?

00:23:30.458 --> 00:23:32.834
Seems he's trying hard
at long-distance running.

00:23:32.917 --> 00:23:34.625
How did you know that?

00:23:34.709 --> 00:23:36.041
You're right of course,

00:23:36.125 --> 00:23:38.125
lately he's been running
first thing in the morning,

00:23:38.208 --> 00:23:40.000
and he's joined
the basketball club!

00:23:40.083 --> 00:23:42.125
Ah.

00:23:42.208 --> 00:23:44.625
Huh... Does he look
like he's enjoying it?

00:23:44.709 --> 00:23:46.125
[SAKURAI]
Hmm.

00:23:46.208 --> 00:23:49.417
He told me it's pretty hard,
but it's also a lot of fun.

00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:52.500
That's good to hear.

00:23:52.583 --> 00:23:54.917
Please tell him
I'm cheering him on, okay?
