00:00:25.692 --> 00:00:28.194 align:middle
It sure is cold out here.

00:00:28.486 --> 00:00:31.531 align:middle
[FUTABA]
You seem sad. What's wrong?

00:00:31.614 --> 00:00:34.325 align:middle
It's just... I dropped
my scarf somewhere.

00:00:34.409 --> 00:00:35.618 align:middle
[FUTABA]
I see.

00:00:35.702 --> 00:00:37.579 align:middle
We don't want you
to catch a cold.

00:00:37.662 --> 00:00:39.205 align:middle
Take mine.

00:00:47.964 --> 00:00:50.425 align:middle
Aren't you going to get
all chilly now, ma'am?

00:00:50.508 --> 00:00:51.468 align:middle
Yup.

00:00:51.551 --> 00:00:52.761 align:middle
But it snows
a lot where I'm from.

00:00:52.844 --> 00:00:54.346 align:middle
I'll be fine.

00:01:03.396 --> 00:01:05.065 align:middle
Thank you so much!

00:01:05.148 --> 00:01:07.942 align:middle
I hope you have
a Merry Christmas!

00:01:21.456 --> 00:01:22.749 align:middle
Yeah, it's pretty nippy.

00:01:22.832 --> 00:01:25.794 align:middle
I wonder if I have time
to go buy some hand warmers.

00:01:29.547 --> 00:01:32.092 align:middle
I'm impressed.
You really are a sweet girl.

00:01:32.175 --> 00:01:33.259 align:middle
Put that on.

00:01:35.261 --> 00:01:37.013 align:middle
[FUTABA] Never, ever
tell anyone about this!

00:01:37.097 --> 00:01:38.181 align:middle
Promise me!

00:01:38.264 --> 00:01:40.183 align:middle
I promise, don't worry.

00:01:40.725 --> 00:01:42.936 align:middle
Then I saw her do one of
the most compassionate things

00:01:43.019 --> 00:01:44.354 align:middle
I've ever witnessed.

00:01:44.437 --> 00:01:46.147 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Hey, keep your big mouth shut!

00:01:46.231 --> 00:01:47.732 align:middle
Were you listening to me at all?

00:01:47.816 --> 00:01:49.526 align:middle
[TAKEDA] She very gently wrapped
it up around the little girl.

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:51.695 align:middle
You could tell Igarashi
was cold, but she...

00:01:51.778 --> 00:01:54.072 align:middle
Seems those two are
as inseparable as ever.

00:01:54.155 --> 00:01:55.323 align:middle
For sure.

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:34.756 align:middle
[CHIEF]
Okay, everybody, form a line!

00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:36.299 align:middle
It's that time of year.

00:03:36.383 --> 00:03:38.218 align:middle
Christmas has found us again.

00:03:38.301 --> 00:03:41.680 align:middle
Step right up and don't be shy!

00:03:45.016 --> 00:03:46.768 align:middle
The Santa lottery
is totally dumb.

00:03:46.851 --> 00:03:48.687 align:middle
All you do is hand out candy.

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:51.356 align:middle
But you did such
a good job last year.

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:53.525 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Get that outta my face!

00:03:53.608 --> 00:03:54.693 align:middle
[gasps]

00:03:54.776 --> 00:03:57.195 align:middle
Takeda, did you draw?
What does it say?

00:03:57.278 --> 00:03:58.780 align:middle
Safe!

00:03:58.863 --> 00:04:02.200 align:middle
Ugh... Which
poor soul will it be?

00:04:05.662 --> 00:04:08.373 align:middle
[SAKURAI]
Huh?

00:04:08.456 --> 00:04:10.542 align:middle
I guess it's me!

00:04:10.625 --> 00:04:12.794 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Huuuh? It's you, Sakurai?

00:04:12.877 --> 00:04:16.172 align:middle
Man, my luck has
finally run out.

00:04:27.809 --> 00:04:30.270 align:middle
I was hounded for pictures
when I was Santa.

00:04:30.353 --> 00:04:33.398 align:middle
I'm glad it's somebody else's
turn this time aroun--

00:04:37.652 --> 00:04:40.739 align:middle
Looks like there are
two Santas this year.

00:04:46.077 --> 00:04:47.162 align:middle
[sighs]

00:04:47.245 --> 00:04:49.789 align:middle
What are the odds
it's me twice in a row?

00:04:49.873 --> 00:04:53.126 align:middle
I must have the
worst luck on the planet.

00:04:57.255 --> 00:04:59.632 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Everything's Christmas-y.

00:05:00.425 --> 00:05:01.968 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Hmm?

00:05:09.017 --> 00:05:11.561 align:middle
Interesting.

00:05:11.644 --> 00:05:15.565 align:middle
Maybe I'll get him something.

00:05:16.107 --> 00:05:17.984 align:middle
<i>Dobryy den!</i>

00:05:18.068 --> 00:05:20.653 align:middle
Ah! Tsukishiro!

00:05:20.737 --> 00:05:21.821 align:middle
Please give me
some kind of warning

00:05:21.905 --> 00:05:23.698 align:middle
before you sneak up on me!

00:05:23.782 --> 00:05:26.826 align:middle
[chuckles] I'm curious,
what's that you're drinking?

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:28.620 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Uh, <i>Oshiruko.</i>

00:05:28.703 --> 00:05:31.122 align:middle
<i>Oshiruko?</i> Is it any good?

00:05:31.206 --> 00:05:34.459 align:middle
[FUTABA] Yeah, it's super tasty,
would you like to try some?

00:05:34.542 --> 00:05:36.211 align:middle
[TSUKISHIRO]
Much obliged.

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:46.429 align:middle
What's going on, do you have
a problem with sweet stuff?

00:05:51.434 --> 00:05:53.436 align:middle
It's hot.

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.480 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Huh?

00:05:59.484 --> 00:06:01.111 align:middle
[WOMAN A]
That was delicious!

00:06:01.194 --> 00:06:02.362 align:middle
[MAN A]
I'm glad you liked it.

00:06:02.445 --> 00:06:05.031 align:middle
Ah... Don't know about you,
but I'm stuffed.

00:06:05.115 --> 00:06:08.284 align:middle
Me too. It was totally worth it,
though. We should come back!

00:06:08.535 --> 00:06:11.371 align:middle
[WOMAN B]
Ah! How beautiful!

00:06:18.253 --> 00:06:21.506 align:middle
[NATSUMI] Hard to believe it's
already Christmas time, huh?

00:06:21.589 --> 00:06:23.425 align:middle
[FUTABA]
It sure is.

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:28.638 align:middle
[NATSUMI] Got any big
plans for the holiday?

00:06:28.722 --> 00:06:31.266 align:middle
Well, I have quite
a bit of work to do.

00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:33.852 align:middle
[NATSUMI] Anyone special you're
planning to get a present for?

00:06:33.935 --> 00:06:35.520 align:middle
Uh. Why do you ask?

00:06:35.603 --> 00:06:37.480 align:middle
[NATSUMI]
No reason.

00:06:37.564 --> 00:06:39.399 align:middle
Just a little curious is all.

00:06:41.192 --> 00:06:42.360 align:middle
I mean...

00:06:42.444 --> 00:06:44.279 align:middle
I'll admit that I've been
thinking about it.

00:06:44.362 --> 00:06:47.240 align:middle
[NATSUMI] Hmmm...
So, you've finally got a--

00:06:47.323 --> 00:06:48.241 align:middle
It's not like that!

00:06:48.324 --> 00:06:49.868 align:middle
He's my supervisor at work!

00:06:49.951 --> 00:06:51.453 align:middle
Supervisor?

00:06:53.455 --> 00:06:56.291 align:middle
He's always doing things
for me so it would--

00:06:56.374 --> 00:06:58.668 align:middle
Never mind, I'm not
getting him anything.

00:06:58.752 --> 00:07:00.462 align:middle
I barely thought about it.

00:07:00.545 --> 00:07:02.422 align:middle
[NATSUMI]
Hmm?

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:04.549 align:middle
Why wouldn't you?

00:07:04.632 --> 00:07:05.967 align:middle
It was a good idea.

00:07:06.051 --> 00:07:07.302 align:middle
Huh?

00:07:07.385 --> 00:07:09.095 align:middle
[NATSUMI] A gift to
express how thankful you are

00:07:09.179 --> 00:07:10.597 align:middle
for all his help.

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:13.892 align:middle
I think that'd be sweet.

00:07:13.975 --> 00:07:15.310 align:middle
Okay.

00:07:15.393 --> 00:07:19.022 align:middle
So, if I were to get him
something, what would he want?

00:07:19.105 --> 00:07:20.815 align:middle
Good question.

00:07:20.899 --> 00:07:23.068 align:middle
Oh, do you think
he would like a necktie?

00:07:23.151 --> 00:07:24.486 align:middle
It would be a really
kind gesture

00:07:24.569 --> 00:07:27.155 align:middle
and office dudes can never
have too many ties.

00:07:27.238 --> 00:07:29.157 align:middle
[FUTABA]
A necktie, huh?

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.117 align:middle
Want to go shopping for one now?

00:07:32.452 --> 00:07:34.245 align:middle
Um. It's just...

00:07:34.329 --> 00:07:36.664 align:middle
Well, I... I guess...

00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:40.085 align:middle
It's not what you think!

00:07:40.168 --> 00:07:42.128 align:middle
I know how it sounds,
but it's not!

00:07:42.212 --> 00:07:44.506 align:middle
Chill out,
I haven't said a word.

00:07:52.347 --> 00:07:53.598 align:middle
Way too many ties.

00:07:53.682 --> 00:07:56.601 align:middle
But how will I know
which one to pick?

00:07:59.562 --> 00:08:01.189 align:middle
[FUTABA]
That's cute.

00:08:04.109 --> 00:08:06.319 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Nah, not his style.

00:08:08.113 --> 00:08:10.323 align:middle
[FUTABA]
I like the pandas.

00:08:10.407 --> 00:08:13.785 align:middle
But I'd say he's way more
of a grizzly bear type.

00:08:15.453 --> 00:08:17.455 align:middle
What's this?

00:08:24.045 --> 00:08:25.171 align:middle
Which one should I choose?

00:08:25.255 --> 00:08:28.133 align:middle
I'm at a total loss here!

00:08:31.886 --> 00:08:34.180 align:middle
Is there anything
I can help you with?

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:39.310 align:middle
[FUTABA]
I'm trying to buy a present,

00:08:39.394 --> 00:08:42.605 align:middle
but I don't know which
one he would like best.

00:08:42.689 --> 00:08:44.899 align:middle
Many women have been
having the same issue.

00:08:44.983 --> 00:08:47.819 align:middle
These two-toned neckties
are a popular choice.

00:08:49.904 --> 00:08:51.906 align:middle
[FUTABA]
This might be the one.

00:08:52.615 --> 00:08:54.701 align:middle
[SALESWOMAN]
Thank you for shopping with us!

00:08:58.204 --> 00:09:00.248 align:middle
[FUTABA]
No going back now.

00:09:01.041 --> 00:09:03.168 align:middle
[SAKURAI]
Merry Christmas!

00:09:13.011 --> 00:09:15.513 align:middle
No laughing! No photos!

00:09:15.597 --> 00:09:16.556 align:middle
Here! Enjoy!

00:09:16.639 --> 00:09:20.393 align:middle
Oh wow. Thanks, Santa. So cute!

00:09:20.477 --> 00:09:22.062 align:middle
You've gotta do
this again next year!

00:09:22.145 --> 00:09:24.439 align:middle
Well, we'll just
have to wait and see.

00:09:25.357 --> 00:09:26.941 align:middle
[SAKURAI]
Kazama.

00:09:27.025 --> 00:09:29.736 align:middle
Hi. Happy Holidays!

00:09:31.696 --> 00:09:33.531 align:middle
Thank you.

00:09:33.615 --> 00:09:35.241 align:middle
[FUTABA] Don't you
understand this is a major blow

00:09:35.325 --> 00:09:36.242 align:middle
to my pride?

00:09:36.326 --> 00:09:37.577 align:middle
I'm sorry about that.

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:39.037 align:middle
You're looking great though.

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:39.996 align:middle
No amount of compliments

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:42.165 align:middle
will make me happy about this.

00:09:42.248 --> 00:09:44.125 align:middle
Hurry up and take
anything you want!

00:09:44.209 --> 00:09:45.085 align:middle
[SAKURAI]
Hey, Futuba!

00:09:45.168 --> 00:09:47.337 align:middle
It's one per person, remember?

00:09:56.012 --> 00:09:57.013 align:middle
I know we were dreading it,

00:09:57.097 --> 00:09:58.932 align:middle
but being Santa
was fun, wasn't it?

00:09:59.015 --> 00:10:01.976 align:middle
Yeah. All in a day's work,
or whatever they say.

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:05.105 align:middle
I was wondering, are you going
to give Takeda a gift this year?

00:10:05.188 --> 00:10:08.400 align:middle
[gasps] Whoa, sounds like
someone had too much eggnog!

00:10:08.483 --> 00:10:11.611 align:middle
[chuckles]

00:10:11.695 --> 00:10:12.737 align:middle
[SAKURAI]
I'm serious.

00:10:12.821 --> 00:10:14.030 align:middle
I think a thoughtful
present from you

00:10:14.114 --> 00:10:16.574 align:middle
would make him really happy.

00:10:35.343 --> 00:10:37.846 align:middle
[EMPLOYEE B]
Igarashi? Sorry to bug you.

00:10:37.929 --> 00:10:39.973 align:middle
Could you please
give me a hand with this?

00:10:40.056 --> 00:10:41.683 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Of course!

00:10:46.604 --> 00:10:49.274 align:middle
Dang, that took longer
than I thought it would.

00:11:04.164 --> 00:11:07.125 align:middle
[MAN B] This restaurant is the
best, we come every year.

00:11:13.923 --> 00:11:16.134 align:middle
So what do I do now?

00:11:27.812 --> 00:11:30.023 align:middle
[phone rings]

00:11:30.106 --> 00:11:31.649 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Hello?

00:11:31.733 --> 00:11:33.568 align:middle
[NATSUMI]
You didn't give it to him?

00:11:33.651 --> 00:11:37.238 align:middle
[FUTABA] No, it never
felt like the right time.

00:11:37.322 --> 00:11:39.240 align:middle
[NATSUMI]
What do you mean the right time?

00:11:39.324 --> 00:11:40.867 align:middle
[FUTABA]
We were never alone together.

00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:43.411 align:middle
It would be weird in
front of our coworkers.

00:11:43.495 --> 00:11:44.996 align:middle
I was thinking about it,

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:48.583 align:middle
and I don't have a real reason
to give him something, anyway.

00:11:48.667 --> 00:11:49.793 align:middle
It doesn't make sense for me

00:11:49.876 --> 00:11:53.713 align:middle
to go out of my way
to deliver a present.

00:11:53.797 --> 00:11:55.840 align:middle
You really mean that?

00:11:55.924 --> 00:11:57.801 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Yeah. I think so.

00:11:57.884 --> 00:11:59.386 align:middle
[sighs]

00:11:59.469 --> 00:12:01.054 align:middle
Well, if that's
how you really feel,

00:12:01.137 --> 00:12:03.973 align:middle
then you should
listen to your gut.

00:12:04.057 --> 00:12:06.351 align:middle
Oh. My pizza is here.

00:12:06.434 --> 00:12:08.144 align:middle
Gotta go.

00:12:20.782 --> 00:12:23.535 align:middle
It's how I really feel.

00:12:28.456 --> 00:12:30.375 align:middle
[FUTABA]
But still...

00:12:48.393 --> 00:12:50.895 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Nice! Nobody's here yet.

00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:00.363 align:middle
[FUTABA] There's no rule that
says I have to hand it to him,

00:13:00.447 --> 00:13:02.824 align:middle
but it'll look weird just
sitting on his desk.

00:13:02.907 --> 00:13:04.367 align:middle
Maybe the chair?

00:13:04.451 --> 00:13:05.618 align:middle
[KAZAMA]
Good morning.

00:13:05.702 --> 00:13:06.995 align:middle
[gasps]

00:13:07.078 --> 00:13:08.121 align:middle
Oh, hey, Kazama!

00:13:08.204 --> 00:13:10.331 align:middle
You're here early!

00:13:10.415 --> 00:13:13.626 align:middle
I've got a lot to do and not
much time before the break.

00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:15.920 align:middle
[yawns]
Man, I'm beat.

00:13:16.004 --> 00:13:18.548 align:middle
[FUTABA laughs]
Yeah, same here!

00:13:25.388 --> 00:13:26.765 align:middle
[EMPLOYEE G]
Yes, that's correct.

00:13:26.848 --> 00:13:28.433 align:middle
[EMPLOYEE A] No problem,
I can check on that right away.

00:13:28.516 --> 00:13:30.018 align:middle
[EMPLOYEE H]
Please run those numbers again.

00:13:30.101 --> 00:13:31.853 align:middle
This isn't adding up.

00:13:31.936 --> 00:13:33.438 align:middle
[EMPLOYEE C]
Please accept our apologies.

00:13:33.521 --> 00:13:34.773 align:middle
[EMPLOYEE E]
Oh my, I'm so sorry.

00:13:34.856 --> 00:13:36.524 align:middle
[EMPLOYEE D] I'll call you
back in five minutes.

00:13:37.108 --> 00:13:38.068 align:middle
[FUTABA]
What's the deal?

00:13:38.151 --> 00:13:40.028 align:middle
I've never seen it so busy.

00:13:40.111 --> 00:13:43.031 align:middle
Is it always like this
at the end of the year?

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:46.618 align:middle
Hey, Futaba,
have you eaten lunch?

00:13:46.701 --> 00:13:48.703 align:middle
[FUTABA]
No, I haven't had time.

00:13:48.787 --> 00:13:49.913 align:middle
I feel fine, though.

00:13:49.996 --> 00:13:53.166 align:middle
[SAKURAI]
Thought so. Here, have this.

00:13:53.249 --> 00:13:54.542 align:middle
Take it easy, all right?

00:13:54.626 --> 00:13:56.795 align:middle
I can try. Thank you.

00:14:01.341 --> 00:14:03.134 align:middle
[groans]

00:14:03.218 --> 00:14:05.178 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Igarashi, quick question.

00:14:05.261 --> 00:14:06.262 align:middle
What's up?

00:14:06.346 --> 00:14:08.515 align:middle
I just found out
I'm needed at a meeting.

00:14:08.598 --> 00:14:10.600 align:middle
Would you like to come along?

00:14:10.684 --> 00:14:12.852 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Yes. Of course I would!

00:14:17.732 --> 00:14:19.943 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Oh... That was exhausting.

00:14:20.026 --> 00:14:21.653 align:middle
You did great through,
excellent work!

00:14:21.736 --> 00:14:23.154 align:middle
Thank you so much.

00:14:23.238 --> 00:14:25.824 align:middle
I'm sorry if I was all weird
and panicky before we left.

00:14:25.907 --> 00:14:27.367 align:middle
Well, I couldn't tell at all.

00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:28.910 align:middle
You fooled me.

00:14:28.993 --> 00:14:30.286 align:middle
Huh?

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:32.414 align:middle
Let's head out;
it's getting late

00:14:34.541 --> 00:14:39.587 align:middle
[FUTABA] Wait, are we just
gonna go our separate ways now?

00:14:39.671 --> 00:14:46.261 align:middle
If so, that means
this is my only chance.

00:14:54.644 --> 00:14:55.478 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Excuse me!

00:14:55.562 --> 00:14:57.480 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Huh?

00:14:57.564 --> 00:15:00.358 align:middle
[FUTABA stomach growls]

00:15:00.442 --> 00:15:03.111 align:middle
[laughs]
Your tummy's got the rumblies.

00:15:03.194 --> 00:15:06.406 align:middle
Don't start! You should be proud
I was working too hard to eat!

00:15:06.489 --> 00:15:08.116 align:middle
Would you like
to grab some dinner?

00:15:08.199 --> 00:15:09.826 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Huh?

00:15:09.909 --> 00:15:11.453 align:middle
Sure.

00:15:11.536 --> 00:15:13.121 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Anything sound good?

00:15:13.204 --> 00:15:16.458 align:middle
Huh? Maybe, uh...

00:15:21.838 --> 00:15:23.048 align:middle
[FUTABA]
How about chicken?

00:15:23.131 --> 00:15:25.342 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Yum! Works for me.

00:15:32.557 --> 00:15:33.641 align:middle
Phenomenal!

00:15:33.725 --> 00:15:36.186 align:middle
Good call picking
this place, Igarashi!

00:15:36.269 --> 00:15:38.646 align:middle
So freakin' juicy!

00:15:38.730 --> 00:15:39.773 align:middle
Aren't we festive?

00:15:39.856 --> 00:15:41.608 align:middle
Nothing beats some
Christmas Chicken.

00:15:41.691 --> 00:15:43.693 align:middle
I agree. We're very merry today.

00:15:43.777 --> 00:15:45.236 align:middle
[chuckles]

00:16:02.128 --> 00:16:04.130 align:middle
Whatcha looking at?

00:16:04.214 --> 00:16:05.382 align:middle
Oh my.

00:16:05.465 --> 00:16:08.051 align:middle
I thought you were
taking pictures of Futaba.

00:16:12.681 --> 00:16:14.224 align:middle
I felt a little silly.

00:16:14.307 --> 00:16:16.434 align:middle
Did I look weird as Santa?

00:16:16.518 --> 00:16:18.186 align:middle
No, not at all.

00:16:18.269 --> 00:16:20.230 align:middle
Promise.

00:16:21.022 --> 00:16:23.316 align:middle
Huuuh?

00:16:24.693 --> 00:16:28.655 align:middle
[giggles]
I'm messing with you!

00:16:28.738 --> 00:16:30.824 align:middle
Who knows,
could be you next year.

00:16:30.907 --> 00:16:33.535 align:middle
[KAZAMA] There's an equal
chance it's you again.

00:16:33.618 --> 00:16:35.578 align:middle
[SAKURAI]
Hmm? I don't know.

00:16:35.662 --> 00:16:38.123 align:middle
I'm usually pretty lucky
with that kind of stuff.

00:16:38.206 --> 00:16:39.290 align:middle
[KAZAMA]
Okay.

00:16:39.374 --> 00:16:42.043 align:middle
So, I guess this time
was the exception?

00:16:42.127 --> 00:16:44.963 align:middle
Huh? Well, maybe.

00:16:52.721 --> 00:16:53.805 align:middle
What is it?

00:16:53.888 --> 00:16:55.765 align:middle
[SAKURAI]
Hmmm...

00:16:55.849 --> 00:16:58.560 align:middle
I was just thinking that,
drawing the Santa lot

00:16:58.643 --> 00:17:01.646 align:middle
might've been lucky
in some strange way.

00:17:04.024 --> 00:17:05.734 align:middle
Because you waited for me.

00:17:05.817 --> 00:17:09.029 align:middle
That's what you were
doing out here, am I right?

00:17:18.121 --> 00:17:24.794 align:middle
[KAZAMA] Um. Please quit
with the teasing.

00:17:24.878 --> 00:17:25.920 align:middle
Huh?!

00:17:26.004 --> 00:17:29.257 align:middle
Uh, okay.

00:17:29.341 --> 00:17:30.967 align:middle
[giggles]

00:17:31.051 --> 00:17:32.927 align:middle
Sorry about that.

00:17:36.097 --> 00:17:38.099 align:middle
Goodnight,
I'll see you next week!

00:17:38.183 --> 00:17:39.559 align:middle
[KAZAMA]
Yeah.

00:17:42.979 --> 00:17:44.105 align:middle
[KAZAMA]
Sakurai!

00:17:44.189 --> 00:17:45.690 align:middle
[SAUKRAI]
Hmm?

00:17:46.483 --> 00:17:49.778 align:middle
[KAZAMA] Well, since
it's Christmas and all.

00:17:49.861 --> 00:17:51.071 align:middle
Maybe.

00:17:51.154 --> 00:17:53.073 align:middle
We could celebrate over dinner.

00:17:56.368 --> 00:17:57.952 align:middle
Sounds good!

00:17:58.036 --> 00:18:00.413 align:middle
[KAZAMA]
All right.

00:18:00.497 --> 00:18:03.291 align:middle
Don't expect there
to be any presents.

00:18:03.375 --> 00:18:05.919 align:middle
[SAKURAI giggles]

00:18:06.002 --> 00:18:07.462 align:middle
If we find some good food,

00:18:07.545 --> 00:18:10.048 align:middle
that'll be enough
of a present for me.

00:18:10.131 --> 00:18:12.509 align:middle
[KAZAMA]
Agreed.

00:18:25.814 --> 00:18:27.399 align:middle
I'm feeling...

00:18:36.449 --> 00:18:38.118 align:middle
[KAZAMA]
Did you say something?

00:18:38.201 --> 00:18:40.078 align:middle
[SAKURAI]
Nuh-uh.

00:18:40.161 --> 00:18:42.539 align:middle
Ramen! Let's get some ramen!

00:18:42.622 --> 00:18:45.208 align:middle
Um. That's not very Christmas-y.

00:18:45.291 --> 00:18:48.837 align:middle
[SAKURAI] Hmm... You may be
right, but it sure is tasty.

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:51.297 align:middle
[KAZAMA]
Guess I can't argue with that.

00:18:51.381 --> 00:18:53.883 align:middle
[SAKURAI]
Then it's settled. Let's go!

00:18:58.263 --> 00:18:59.014 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Oh!

00:18:59.097 --> 00:19:00.098 align:middle
Huh?

00:19:00.181 --> 00:19:01.975 align:middle
Yummy cakes for sale!

00:19:02.058 --> 00:19:03.309 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Wanna get one?

00:19:03.393 --> 00:19:04.352 align:middle
I don't know.

00:19:04.436 --> 00:19:06.229 align:middle
I just ate my weight in chicken.

00:19:06.312 --> 00:19:07.647 align:middle
Understood.

00:19:07.731 --> 00:19:08.690 align:middle
The streets will
be a little duller

00:19:08.773 --> 00:19:11.026 align:middle
when Christmas
is over, won't they?

00:19:11.109 --> 00:19:12.861 align:middle
Oh, most definitely.

00:19:16.489 --> 00:19:17.615 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Whoa!

00:19:17.699 --> 00:19:19.909 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Hmm? What's the matter?

00:19:19.993 --> 00:19:21.327 align:middle
Huh?

00:19:21.411 --> 00:19:22.370 align:middle
It's snowing!

00:19:22.454 --> 00:19:24.497 align:middle
Would you get a load of this?

00:19:30.337 --> 00:19:34.841 align:middle
Ohh!
[laughs]

00:19:35.842 --> 00:19:36.801 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Ooo, chilly.

00:19:36.885 --> 00:19:37.677 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Hey, Takeda!

00:19:37.761 --> 00:19:39.512 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Hmm?

00:19:39.596 --> 00:19:42.849 align:middle
I appreciate how
you look out for me.

00:19:42.932 --> 00:19:44.184 align:middle
And since it's Christmas,

00:19:44.267 --> 00:19:47.687 align:middle
I thought this would be
a good way to say thanks.

00:19:52.942 --> 00:19:54.235 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
This is...

00:19:54.319 --> 00:19:55.403 align:middle
[FUTABA]
It was pretty hard

00:19:55.487 --> 00:19:57.655 align:middle
to find the right time
to give it to you.

00:19:57.739 --> 00:19:58.990 align:middle
And because
you're older than me,

00:19:59.074 --> 00:20:02.243 align:middle
I wasn't quite sure
what you'd want.

00:20:02.327 --> 00:20:04.496 align:middle
So, like, if you
absolutely hate it,

00:20:04.579 --> 00:20:05.830 align:middle
feel free to throw it away.

00:20:05.914 --> 00:20:08.416 align:middle
I seriously wouldn't
be offended at all

00:20:11.378 --> 00:20:14.464 align:middle
I'll cherish it!
Thank you so much!

00:20:17.384 --> 00:20:19.761 align:middle
Um. Well, good for you, then.

00:20:19.844 --> 00:20:21.137 align:middle
I'm glad you like it.

00:20:21.221 --> 00:20:23.181 align:middle
For sure! Oh!

00:20:23.264 --> 00:20:26.810 align:middle
Hang on. Almost forgot.

00:20:30.438 --> 00:20:31.815 align:middle
What's this?

00:20:31.898 --> 00:20:33.149 align:middle
The other day,

00:20:33.233 --> 00:20:36.903 align:middle
I saw you give your
scarf away to a little girl.

00:20:36.986 --> 00:20:38.863 align:middle
That was my inspiration.

00:20:38.947 --> 00:20:42.450 align:middle
You know, for your
Christmas present.

00:20:47.205 --> 00:20:49.124 align:middle
Thank you, this means a lot.

00:20:49.207 --> 00:20:52.794 align:middle
[TAKEDA laughs] Come on,
it's nothing too special.

00:21:08.518 --> 00:21:13.023 align:middle
[FUTABA] I wonder if Takeda
will wear the tie to work today.

00:21:14.232 --> 00:21:15.692 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Morning!

00:21:18.611 --> 00:21:19.946 align:middle
Hey, Igarashi.

00:21:20.030 --> 00:21:21.948 align:middle
There's something
I need to ask you.

00:21:26.536 --> 00:21:28.705 align:middle
It's about the gift you
gave me the other day.

00:21:28.788 --> 00:21:30.540 align:middle
It looked great
when I tried it on.

00:21:30.623 --> 00:21:32.208 align:middle
[FUTABA]
I knew he wouldn't wear it.

00:21:32.292 --> 00:21:35.628 align:middle
There was no way I could've
predicted his taste in ties.

00:21:35.712 --> 00:21:37.630 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
It might get dirty if I wear it.

00:21:37.714 --> 00:21:38.673 align:middle
There are so
many things that I...

00:21:38.757 --> 00:21:40.216 align:middle
[FUTABA]
It's not a big deal.

00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:41.843 align:middle
I told him he
could throw it away.

00:21:41.926 --> 00:21:45.347 align:middle
So, why am I about to cry?

00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:46.723 align:middle
Hey, are you okay?

00:21:46.806 --> 00:21:48.767 align:middle
Huh? What were you saying?

00:21:48.850 --> 00:21:50.018 align:middle
I zoned out.

00:21:50.101 --> 00:21:52.395 align:middle
I was about to ask you:
Would it be all right

00:21:52.479 --> 00:21:55.190 align:middle
if I display the tie you
gave me on my desk?

00:21:55.273 --> 00:21:56.733 align:middle
Be honest.

00:22:00.904 --> 00:22:03.698 align:middle
I did think about wearing it
into the office today,

00:22:03.782 --> 00:22:05.700 align:middle
but it's way too good for that.

00:22:05.784 --> 00:22:09.871 align:middle
If it's just sitting on
my desk, it should stay safe.

00:22:09.954 --> 00:22:11.414 align:middle
You can't do that!

00:22:11.498 --> 00:22:14.501 align:middle
You think I bought it for you
to use as a paperweight?

00:22:15.752 --> 00:22:18.630 align:middle
Well, fine.
I can hang it up at home.

00:22:20.715 --> 00:22:22.258 align:middle
Just put it on!
