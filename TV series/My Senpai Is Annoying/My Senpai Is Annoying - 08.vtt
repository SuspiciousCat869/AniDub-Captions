the dolphin show
is about to start.

00:12:04.057 --> 00:12:05.934 align:middle
Cool, a dolphin show!

00:12:06.017 --> 00:12:08.645 align:middle
I don't think I've ever
seen a dolphin in person.

00:12:08.728 --> 00:12:11.564 align:middle
Not even on a field trip
or something?

00:12:13.483 --> 00:12:14.776 align:middle
[KAZAMA]
I was sick.

00:12:14.859 --> 00:12:17.028 align:middle
[SAKURAI]
Aw, poor baby.

00:12:20.699 --> 00:12:22.450 align:middle
Welcome to the show!

00:12:22.534 --> 00:12:26.496 align:middle
It's about time for you
to meet our swimmy stars!

00:12:26.579 --> 00:12:29.416 align:middle
White-sided dolphin, Maki!

00:12:29.499 --> 00:12:35.213 align:middle
And Haruto! And lastly, Souta!

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:38.425 align:middle
[KAZAMA]
We have the same name.

00:12:38.508 --> 00:12:40.802 align:middle
[SAKURAI giggling]
You look like twins.

00:12:58.862 --> 00:13:01.781 align:middle
[MC]
Close, but no cigar, Haruto!

00:13:07.704 --> 00:13:09.664 align:middle
[MC]
Nice save, Souta!

00:13:09.748 --> 00:13:12.167 align:middle
Now Souta might have
a bit of a creepy stare,

00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:13.293 align:middle
but he's a sweetheart,

00:13:13.376 --> 00:13:16.129 align:middle
always helping out
his fellow dolphins.

00:13:16.212 --> 00:13:18.173 align:middle
Whoa...

00:13:20.091 --> 00:13:21.426 align:middle
From the way she put it,

00:13:21.509 --> 00:13:24.387 align:middle
that Souta sounds
a lot like you.

00:13:24.471 --> 00:13:25.722 align:middle
Huh?

00:13:25.805 --> 00:13:28.224 align:middle
I guess.
You mean the creepy stare?

00:13:28.308 --> 00:13:29.267 align:middle
[SAKURAI chuckles]

00:13:29.351 --> 00:13:32.020 align:middle
You have similar stares, but...

00:13:32.103 --> 00:13:34.647 align:middle
...I was talking about
the being helpful part.

00:13:34.731 --> 00:13:38.193 align:middle
Whenever I find myself
in a sticky situation,

00:13:38.276 --> 00:13:41.154 align:middle
you're always
there to help me out.

00:13:41.237 --> 00:13:44.199 align:middle
You're a genuinely
kind person

00:13:44.282 --> 00:13:48.620 align:middle
to Futaba and me
and everyone else.

00:13:48.703 --> 00:13:50.121 align:middle
Not to everyone.

00:13:50.205 --> 00:13:52.499 align:middle
Huh?

00:13:52.582 --> 00:13:57.253 align:middle
It's not that I'm just
some great person. I--

00:13:58.797 --> 00:14:02.509 align:middle
[MC]
An impressive jump from Souta!

00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:07.389 align:middle
Great job, buddy!

00:14:10.266 --> 00:14:11.434 align:middle
Well, they weren't kidding.

00:14:11.518 --> 00:14:13.770 align:middle
You really can
get soaked out here.

00:14:13.853 --> 00:14:17.857 align:middle
Looking back, we should've
rented those ponchos.

00:14:17.941 --> 00:14:20.777 align:middle
I'll find a towel later.

00:14:22.904 --> 00:14:26.241 align:middle
You never look happier then
when you're staring at my chest.

00:14:30.537 --> 00:14:31.913 align:middle
[WEATHER FORECASTER]
Today's weather is bright,

00:14:31.996 --> 00:14:33.832 align:middle
sunny, and
perfect for a daytrip.

00:14:33.915 --> 00:14:36.710 align:middle
So, find a loved one
and enjoy the holiday!

00:14:36.793 --> 00:14:39.963 align:middle
Now, it's time to look
at the weekly forecast.

00:14:40.046 --> 00:14:41.923 align:middle
The fact that you and I
are eating ramen together

00:14:42.007 --> 00:14:44.217 align:middle
kinda makes it feel
like we're still at work.

00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:45.218 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Huh?

00:14:45.301 --> 00:14:48.304 align:middle
[laughs]
You said it!

00:14:48.388 --> 00:14:51.057 align:middle
But all the fun places are
packed during Golden Week.

00:14:51.141 --> 00:14:53.351 align:middle
Here, it's nice and empty.

00:14:53.435 --> 00:14:55.603 align:middle
Gee, what an astute observation!

00:14:55.687 --> 00:14:57.230 align:middle
It's the perfect combo.

00:14:57.313 --> 00:14:58.982 align:middle
Good ramen and no crowd.

00:14:59.065 --> 00:15:00.483 align:middle
[RAMEN SHOP OWNER]
You don't get it, do you?

00:15:00.567 --> 00:15:02.777 align:middle
Some businessman.

00:15:02.861 --> 00:15:06.239 align:middle
[MC] With that,
we conclude our dolphin show.

00:15:06.322 --> 00:15:08.116 align:middle
Thank you for coming!

00:15:12.662 --> 00:15:15.290 align:middle
Souta's jump was definitely
my favorite part!

00:15:15.373 --> 00:15:16.916 align:middle
Yeah, cool stuff.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.503 align:middle
It did get me
pretty soaked, though.

00:15:20.587 --> 00:15:21.880 align:middle
Sorry.

00:15:21.963 --> 00:15:24.049 align:middle
Huh? For what?

00:15:24.132 --> 00:15:26.926 align:middle
[KAZAMA]
Well, uh, for not shielding you.

00:15:27.010 --> 00:15:28.386 align:middle
[SAKURAI]
Shielding me?

00:15:35.685 --> 00:15:37.270 align:middle
You mean like that?

00:15:37.354 --> 00:15:39.773 align:middle
[KAZAMA]
Yeah, that was the general idea.

00:15:39.856 --> 00:15:42.233 align:middle
[SAKURAI laughs]

00:15:42.317 --> 00:15:44.152 align:middle
[KAZAMA]
She's laughing at me.

00:15:45.987 --> 00:15:48.073 align:middle
[SAKURAI]
Hmm, should I buy something?

00:15:48.156 --> 00:15:51.576 align:middle
What would the best
aquarium souvenir even be?

00:15:51.659 --> 00:15:53.870 align:middle
[SAKURAI]
Maybe a stuffed animal.

00:15:53.953 --> 00:15:57.165 align:middle
[KAZAMA] Hey, it looks like that
dolphin's got his own merch.

00:15:58.208 --> 00:16:00.460 align:middle
Really quick. Hold this, 'kay?

00:16:01.711 --> 00:16:06.800 align:middle
[SKURAI laughing]
Aw, two cuties!

00:16:06.883 --> 00:16:09.177 align:middle
[KAZAMA]
Now she's really laughing.

00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:13.223 align:middle
[SAKURAI]
My stomach hurts from laughing.

00:16:13.306 --> 00:16:16.059 align:middle
[KAZAMA] Well, it looks
like she's having fun.

00:16:22.107 --> 00:16:23.858 align:middle
[FUTABA]
So cute.

00:16:23.942 --> 00:16:25.527 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
You want that one?

00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:28.530 align:middle
[FUTABA] Yeah, but claw
machines don't really like me.

00:16:28.613 --> 00:16:30.407 align:middle
I seriously never win.

00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:32.992 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
I see. Okay, then!

00:16:35.745 --> 00:16:37.831 align:middle
Let me take care of this one!

00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:49.843 align:middle
[FUTABA]
You were way off!

00:16:49.926 --> 00:16:51.845 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Hm? Was I really?

00:16:51.928 --> 00:16:53.054 align:middle
Just a quick question,

00:16:53.138 --> 00:16:55.265 align:middle
have you ever played
a claw machine before?

00:16:55.348 --> 00:16:56.725 align:middle
Nope, never in my life.

00:16:56.808 --> 00:16:59.561 align:middle
Ah! What?
You've gotta be kidding!

00:16:59.644 --> 00:17:00.812 align:middle
Now that I've started this game,

00:17:00.895 --> 00:17:03.314 align:middle
there's no way I'm
giving up without a fight.

00:17:03.398 --> 00:17:04.691 align:middle
But it's--

00:17:04.774 --> 00:17:06.985 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Don't worry.

00:17:07.068 --> 00:17:09.320 align:middle
You just relax and
watch me win this thing.

00:17:09.404 --> 00:17:10.989 align:middle
I'm having fun.

00:17:13.283 --> 00:17:15.577 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Oh! I had it there for a second!

00:17:18.079 --> 00:17:21.499 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Nice! Come on! Come on!

00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:30.967 align:middle
Haha! I got one!

00:17:31.051 --> 00:17:33.845 align:middle
You're the greatest ever!

00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:36.014 align:middle
Here you are.

00:17:36.097 --> 00:17:38.224 align:middle
Thanks so much, I love it!

00:17:38.308 --> 00:17:39.809 align:middle
I feel bad you
spent all that money

00:17:39.893 --> 00:17:41.519 align:middle
just to win this little guy.

00:17:41.603 --> 00:17:43.146 align:middle
It was completely worth it.

00:17:43.229 --> 00:17:44.272 align:middle
I had a really good time!

00:17:44.356 --> 00:17:45.815 align:middle
[FATHER A]
We hit the mother lode!

00:17:45.899 --> 00:17:47.150 align:middle
[SON]
It was too easy!

00:17:47.233 --> 00:17:48.777 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Hmm?

00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:50.570 align:middle
[FATHER A]
We should come back here soon.

00:17:50.653 --> 00:17:53.490 align:middle
[SON]
Yeah, it's like we made money!

00:17:58.286 --> 00:17:59.788 align:middle
[TAKEDA] When we're walking
down the street like this,

00:17:59.871 --> 00:18:01.706 align:middle
it feels like a regular workday.

00:18:01.790 --> 00:18:03.083 align:middle
Yeah, that's true.

00:18:05.752 --> 00:18:08.129 align:middle
[FUTABA] It's not exactly
what I'd planned for my break,

00:18:08.213 --> 00:18:11.883 align:middle
but this has been
pretty nice, too.

00:18:11.966 --> 00:18:13.343 align:middle
I guess.

00:18:18.723 --> 00:18:21.267 align:middle
That was so much fun!

00:18:21.351 --> 00:18:23.978 align:middle
I'm sad it's already over.

00:18:27.107 --> 00:18:29.275 align:middle
[KAZAMA]
Sakurai.

00:18:29.359 --> 00:18:30.777 align:middle
Wait here for a moment.

00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:32.278 align:middle
Huh?

00:18:32.362 --> 00:18:33.780 align:middle
I'll be right back.

00:18:34.989 --> 00:18:36.741 align:middle
[SAKURAI]
Did he forget something?

00:18:39.744 --> 00:18:41.663 align:middle
[DAUGHTER]
The dolphins were so cute!

00:18:41.746 --> 00:18:42.706 align:middle
Oh, yeah?

00:18:42.789 --> 00:18:44.249 align:middle
Well, we'll have
to visit them again.

00:18:44.332 --> 00:18:45.625 align:middle
[DAUGHTER]
Mm-hmm!

00:18:46.501 --> 00:18:48.920 align:middle
[MAN C]
Hey there, gorgeous!

00:18:49.004 --> 00:18:50.088 align:middle
We're wondering

00:18:50.171 --> 00:18:52.090 align:middle
if you wanna grab
some maté tea with us.

00:18:52.173 --> 00:18:53.466 align:middle
Hold it!

00:18:53.550 --> 00:18:55.844 align:middle
You don't know this girl;
don't speak so casually!

00:18:55.927 --> 00:18:58.888 align:middle
[MAN C]
Oh, right. My bad.

00:18:58.972 --> 00:19:01.349 align:middle
[SAKURAI]
Oh, jeez.

00:19:01.433 --> 00:19:02.308 align:middle
Sorry, I can't.

00:19:02.392 --> 00:19:03.727 align:middle
I'm here with someone else.

00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:05.895 align:middle
Ah. Well, that's a shame.

00:19:05.979 --> 00:19:09.024 align:middle
Oh, come on, at the
very least have one cup!

00:19:09.107 --> 00:19:10.859 align:middle
Maté tea is good stuff!

00:19:10.942 --> 00:19:12.193 align:middle
[gasps]

00:19:12.277 --> 00:19:13.611 align:middle
Hey, wait.

00:19:15.196 --> 00:19:16.573 align:middle

00:19:16.656 --> 00:19:18.033 align:middle
[MAN C, D]
Hmm?

00:19:18.116 --> 00:19:20.368 align:middle
The hell do you
think you're doing?

00:19:20.452 --> 00:19:22.370 align:middle
[MAN D]
Who's asking?

00:19:23.204 --> 00:19:24.831 align:middle
Me. I'm with her.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.962 align:middle
Why don't you start by letting
go of her hand immediately?

00:19:31.046 --> 00:19:34.132 align:middle
She's mine. So back off.

00:19:40.221 --> 00:19:41.473 align:middle
[MAN D]
What's his deal?

00:19:41.556 --> 00:19:43.350 align:middle
[MAN C] I think he might've
embarrassed himself

00:19:43.433 --> 00:19:45.185 align:middle
a little bit.

00:19:46.353 --> 00:19:47.604 align:middle

Look. A UFO.

00:19:47.687 --> 00:19:48.897 align:middle

C'mon, Hurry!

00:19:53.818 --> 00:19:55.278 align:middle

Slow down!

00:20:04.537 --> 00:20:05.497 align:middle
You're missing out.

00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:08.541 align:middle
This tea is like
seriously amazing!

00:20:19.594 --> 00:20:23.390 align:middle
[SAKURAI] Uh, could
you repeat what you said?

00:20:26.393 --> 00:20:28.687 align:middle
The thing that
I said back there.

00:20:28.770 --> 00:20:32.440 align:middle
It was a line from a shoujo
manga I used to read.

00:20:33.608 --> 00:20:37.404 align:middle
[laughs]
That makes sense.

00:20:37.487 --> 00:20:39.447 align:middle
Very in character.

00:20:40.448 --> 00:20:41.783 align:middle

It was lame, huh?

00:20:41.866 --> 00:20:44.452 align:middle
[SAKURAI]
Nuh-uh.

00:20:44.536 --> 00:20:45.954 align:middle
It sounded cool.

00:20:46.037 --> 00:20:47.664 align:middle
To me, at least.

00:20:51.835 --> 00:20:53.837 align:middle
Huh? That's right.

00:20:56.631 --> 00:20:59.217 align:middle
Um, here.

00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:00.969 align:middle
Huh?

00:21:01.803 --> 00:21:03.972 align:middle
You got me Souta!

00:21:04.055 --> 00:21:07.142 align:middle
[KAZAMA]
Yeah. I hope that's not weird.

00:21:07.225 --> 00:21:08.685 align:middle
I love it!

00:21:10.478 --> 00:21:13.898 align:middle
Well, I'm really glad.

00:21:13.982 --> 00:21:15.525 align:middle
I can carry it for now.

00:21:15.608 --> 00:21:17.152 align:middle
[SAKURAI]
Thank you.

00:21:18.236 --> 00:21:20.405 align:middle
The train should
be on its way. You ready?

00:21:20.488 --> 00:21:22.032 align:middle
[SAKURAI]
Mm.

00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:31.332 align:middle
Thanks so much for today, Souta.

00:21:35.962 --> 00:21:38.423 align:middle
Hurry up! Let's go, Kazama.

00:21:48.308 --> 00:21:50.518 align:middle
[KAZAMA]
You are one lucky dolphin.

00:21:59.194 --> 00:22:00.862 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Check it out, Takeda!

00:22:00.945 --> 00:22:03.156 align:middle
Looks like Sakurai
brought us some yummy treats.

00:22:03.239 --> 00:22:06.659 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Ohh... Mmm...

00:22:06.743 --> 00:22:08.119 align:middle
I think I'm a fan.

00:22:08.203 --> 00:22:10.205 align:middle
Me too. These are awesome.

00:22:10.288 --> 00:22:12.248 align:middle
Oh, yeah, hold on.
