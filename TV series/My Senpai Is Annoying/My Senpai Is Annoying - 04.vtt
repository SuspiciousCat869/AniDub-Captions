00:00:21.813 --> 00:00:23.440 align:middle
Huh?

00:00:28.528 --> 00:00:30.238 align:middle
[FUTABA sneezes]

00:00:30.321 --> 00:00:32.615 align:middle
Aah! Brisk.

00:00:35.368 --> 00:00:36.953 align:middle
That's not really like her.

00:00:37.037 --> 00:00:40.123 align:middle
I don't know, it has
been pretty cold lately.

00:00:40.206 --> 00:00:40.999 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Morning.

00:00:41.082 --> 00:00:42.751 align:middle
[GROUP]
Hmm?

00:00:42.834 --> 00:00:44.794 align:middle
What are you guys up to?

00:00:44.878 --> 00:00:46.338 align:middle
Oh, that's right.

00:00:46.421 --> 00:00:49.507 align:middle
I always forget that you're not
even on the group app with us.

00:00:49.591 --> 00:00:50.925 align:middle
What app is that?

00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:52.344 align:middle
Well, hold on, for starters,

00:00:52.427 --> 00:00:55.889 align:middle
aren't you the guy
without a smartphone?

00:00:55.972 --> 00:00:56.723 align:middle
Correct!

00:00:56.806 --> 00:00:58.141 align:middle
I've got this bad boy.

00:00:58.224 --> 00:01:00.977 align:middle
[KAZAMA] I can't believe
you're using the company cell.

00:01:01.061 --> 00:01:02.395 align:middle
[SAKURAI]
Hey, did you know?

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:04.773 align:middle
Futaba's out with a cold today.

00:01:07.817 --> 00:01:10.487 align:middle
Oh...

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.035 align:middle
She's sick, huh?

00:02:53.048 --> 00:02:57.218 align:middle
[FUTABA coughs]

00:02:58.136 --> 00:03:01.639 align:middle
[FUTABA]
It's weird being home from work.

00:03:01.723 --> 00:03:05.769 align:middle
This is my first cold since
I started living on my own.

00:03:06.895 --> 00:03:09.105 align:middle
[FUTABA]
I feel so alone.

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:10.899 align:middle
What if it keeps getting
worse and worse

00:03:10.982 --> 00:03:14.069 align:middle
and no one ever finds me?

00:03:17.072 --> 00:03:18.907 align:middle
No!

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:20.742 align:middle
[phone beeps]

00:03:29.918 --> 00:03:31.586 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Grandpa.

00:03:39.803 --> 00:03:42.138 align:middle
I can't. He'll only worry.

00:03:42.222 --> 00:03:43.473 align:middle
Or worse.

00:03:43.556 --> 00:03:47.143 align:middle
Futaba! I'm on my way!

00:03:47.977 --> 00:03:50.605 align:middle
He'll come right over.

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:58.947 align:middle
I feel gross,
but I should eat something.

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:02.242 align:middle
I've got to get well,
so I can go back to work.

00:04:16.506 --> 00:04:17.590 align:middle
[sighs]

00:04:17.674 --> 00:04:19.134 align:middle
That's right, I was
gonna grocery-shop

00:04:19.217 --> 00:04:22.262 align:middle
on the way home from work today.

00:04:22.345 --> 00:04:25.181 align:middle
Guess I'd better go out
and get something.

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.564 align:middle
I'm so not changing, though.

00:04:34.774 --> 00:04:37.152 align:middle
[coughs]

00:04:49.956 --> 00:04:51.458 align:middle
Oh, man.

00:04:51.541 --> 00:04:54.669 align:middle
The front door seems so far.

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:11.311 align:middle
Oh... Guess I got
here just in time.

00:05:11.394 --> 00:05:14.481 align:middle
I stopped and got you
some food and energy drinks.

00:05:14.564 --> 00:05:16.733 align:middle
But, why?

00:05:16.816 --> 00:05:18.276 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Take it.

00:05:20.236 --> 00:05:21.863 align:middle
[TAKEDA] Seems like
something's going around.

00:05:21.946 --> 00:05:23.823 align:middle
Sorry you got it.

00:05:23.907 --> 00:05:25.784 align:middle
You okay?

00:05:27.786 --> 00:05:30.455 align:middle
Well, eat that and
get some rest, all right?

00:05:30.538 --> 00:05:31.790 align:middle
I'll see ya later!

00:05:31.873 --> 00:05:33.375 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Uh, um...

00:05:35.585 --> 00:05:37.295 align:middle
Listen, I feel like crap,

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:39.798 align:middle
and I don't think
I can eat on my own.

00:05:39.881 --> 00:05:43.635 align:middle
It'd be a really big help if
someone else could cook for me.

00:05:43.718 --> 00:05:45.512 align:middle
Just throwing it out
as an option,

00:05:45.595 --> 00:05:47.347 align:middle
you don't have to or anything.

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.140 align:middle
Uh.

00:05:50.392 --> 00:05:51.726 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
'Course I will.

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:53.895 align:middle
Sorry you felt so alone.

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:07.325 align:middle
Yes!

00:06:09.411 --> 00:06:11.204 align:middle
Where're her bowls?

00:06:11.287 --> 00:06:13.498 align:middle
[FUTABA]
The kitchen rack.

00:06:13.581 --> 00:06:17.252 align:middle
The bowl you want's on the
kitchen rack on the bottom-left.

00:06:17.335 --> 00:06:20.505 align:middle
Kitchen rack on the bottom-left.

00:06:20.588 --> 00:06:23.174 align:middle
Oh, yeah, there it is.

00:06:23.258 --> 00:06:24.968 align:middle
I'm sorry about this.

00:06:25.051 --> 00:06:26.678 align:middle
Don't you fret.

00:06:34.352 --> 00:06:36.646 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
It's ready. Can you eat?

00:06:40.734 --> 00:06:42.193 align:middle
Yeah, thanks.

00:06:45.447 --> 00:06:48.033 align:middle
Homemade udon!

00:06:48.116 --> 00:06:49.993 align:middle
Yeah. I thought
you might like it.

00:06:50.076 --> 00:06:51.661 align:middle
Yep.

00:06:51.745 --> 00:06:53.288 align:middle
Careful now, it's hot.

00:06:53.371 --> 00:06:54.664 align:middle
Thank you so much.

00:06:54.748 --> 00:06:55.874 align:middle
Sure!

00:07:02.005 --> 00:07:04.090 align:middle
Oh, it's so nice and warm.

00:07:06.301 --> 00:07:09.471 align:middle
If appetite counts
for anything, you'll be fine.

00:07:22.025 --> 00:07:23.443 align:middle
Aww.

00:07:26.946 --> 00:07:29.532 align:middle
Oh! Would you mind
not looking at those?

00:07:29.616 --> 00:07:31.409 align:middle
Oh! Sorry.

00:07:33.453 --> 00:07:34.871 align:middle
My bad.

00:07:34.954 --> 00:07:36.247 align:middle
By the way,

00:07:36.331 --> 00:07:38.750 align:middle
I forgot I had some
documents I'd been working on

00:07:38.833 --> 00:07:41.336 align:middle
that needed to be
turned in by tomorrow.

00:07:41.419 --> 00:07:42.962 align:middle
I see.

00:07:43.046 --> 00:07:44.798 align:middle
Pretty sure
I took care of it, though.

00:07:44.881 --> 00:07:46.341 align:middle
Will you rest?

00:07:46.424 --> 00:07:47.634 align:middle
Sorry 'bout all this.

00:07:47.717 --> 00:07:49.177 align:middle
What are you talking about?

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:52.222 align:middle
We should help each
other out at times like these.

00:07:52.305 --> 00:07:54.140 align:middle
Sakurai, Kazama, and the others,

00:07:54.224 --> 00:07:57.060 align:middle
they were all worried
about you today.

00:07:57.143 --> 00:07:58.728 align:middle
Thanks.

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:02.982 align:middle
You've got quite a fever.

00:08:03.066 --> 00:08:04.734 align:middle
Try to sleep.

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:25.922 align:middle
My fever's gone down.

00:08:26.006 --> 00:08:28.800 align:middle
Takeda, you here?

00:08:35.807 --> 00:08:37.475 align:middle
How sweet.

00:08:48.737 --> 00:08:50.905 align:middle
He saw my place, though.

00:08:55.076 --> 00:08:56.244 align:middle
Good morning!

00:08:56.327 --> 00:08:59.539 align:middle
Ah! You're back!

00:09:00.123 --> 00:09:01.541 align:middle
Are you over your cold now?

00:09:01.624 --> 00:09:04.377 align:middle
I am.
Thanks for all your concern.

00:09:04.461 --> 00:09:07.047 align:middle
It was so lonely I could
barely focus on my work.

00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:09.591 align:middle
Yeah, but that's
an every day thing.

00:09:09.674 --> 00:09:10.967 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Morning.

00:09:12.802 --> 00:09:14.220 align:middle
Uh.

00:09:14.304 --> 00:09:16.931 align:middle
Uh. Good morning, Takeda.

00:09:17.015 --> 00:09:18.683 align:middle
Hey! All better, then?

00:09:18.767 --> 00:09:19.517 align:middle
Yes.

00:09:19.601 --> 00:09:21.186 align:middle
Well, that's great.

00:09:21.269 --> 00:09:24.689 align:middle
You had quite a fever, you know?

00:09:24.773 --> 00:09:26.316 align:middle
W-We should get to work!

00:09:26.399 --> 00:09:28.193 align:middle
Let's go make calls
or something!

00:09:28.276 --> 00:09:30.528 align:middle
Look at you! Just raring to go!

00:09:34.032 --> 00:09:35.325 align:middle
Listen, you're still recovering,

00:09:35.408 --> 00:09:37.160 align:middle
so don't push yourself too hard.

00:09:37.243 --> 00:09:38.953 align:middle
I'm feeling a lot better now.

00:09:39.037 --> 00:09:40.288 align:middle
Fair enough.

00:09:40.372 --> 00:09:42.540 align:middle
Hey, you really like stuffed
animals, don't you?

00:09:42.624 --> 00:09:44.167 align:middle
You have a few.

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:46.544 align:middle
I've been collecting
them for a long time.

00:09:46.628 --> 00:09:48.922 align:middle
Huh.

00:09:49.005 --> 00:09:51.675 align:middle
I should've gone to check
on you earlier than I did.

00:09:51.758 --> 00:09:52.801 align:middle
I guess I was the only one

00:09:52.884 --> 00:09:55.011 align:middle
who didn't know
you'd caught a cold.

00:09:59.766 --> 00:10:03.103 align:middle
It's probably time
I got a smartphone.

00:10:03.186 --> 00:10:04.521 align:middle
Yeah, you should!

00:10:04.604 --> 00:10:06.856 align:middle
That way we could get in
touch with you more easily.

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:11.236 align:middle
Well, the problem is, I have
no clue which kind to get.

00:10:11.319 --> 00:10:13.279 align:middle
[FUTABA]
I could help you out with that.

00:10:13.363 --> 00:10:14.823 align:middle
Oh! Great!

00:10:14.906 --> 00:10:16.533 align:middle
I'm free on our next day off,

00:10:16.616 --> 00:10:18.618 align:middle
if that works for you.

00:10:24.374 --> 00:10:26.042 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Igarashi!

00:10:26.126 --> 00:10:27.419 align:middle
Hey!

00:10:30.171 --> 00:10:31.339 align:middle
[ANNOUNCER]
Thank you for waiting.

00:10:31.423 --> 00:10:32.716 align:middle
Thanks for this.

00:10:32.799 --> 00:10:34.509 align:middle
Are you really okay
spending your day off

00:10:34.592 --> 00:10:37.971 align:middle
helping a nerdy geezer
pick out his first smartphone?

00:10:38.054 --> 00:10:39.389 align:middle
Yes, because
it'll make it easier

00:10:39.472 --> 00:10:41.182 align:middle
for me to get hold of you.

00:10:41.266 --> 00:10:43.309 align:middle
Makes sense.

00:10:43.393 --> 00:10:45.353 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Plus.

00:10:45.437 --> 00:10:48.523 align:middle
You did take care of me
when I was sick, so...

00:10:50.066 --> 00:10:51.568 align:middle
[CLERK]
Hello, Sir!

00:10:51.651 --> 00:10:53.361 align:middle
You're here to shop
with your daughter?

00:10:53.445 --> 00:10:55.780 align:middle
We carry smartphones
just for kids, you know?

00:10:57.907 --> 00:10:59.701 align:middle
[CLERK]
Thanks so much for coming in!

00:11:00.618 --> 00:11:02.662 align:middle
You're a real lifesaver!

00:11:02.746 --> 00:11:05.790 align:middle
I don't know what I would've
done without you in there.

00:11:05.874 --> 00:11:07.375 align:middle
You better guard it
with your life,

00:11:07.459 --> 00:11:10.795 align:middle
'cause if it breaks, I am so not
going back in there with you.

00:11:10.879 --> 00:11:13.048 align:middle
All right, understood.

00:11:13.131 --> 00:11:15.925 align:middle
And now I can get in touch
with you anytime, huh?

00:11:16.009 --> 00:11:18.887 align:middle
You can, as long
as it's work related.

00:11:20.805 --> 00:11:22.557 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Something wrong?

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:25.435 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Here. Contact info!

00:11:25.518 --> 00:11:26.770 align:middle
If we don't exchange that first,

00:11:26.853 --> 00:11:28.855 align:middle
we can't get
a hold of each other.

00:11:28.938 --> 00:11:30.690 align:middle
Ah! I get it.

00:11:30.774 --> 00:11:32.776 align:middle
[FUTABA] You need to
add me to your friends list.

00:11:32.859 --> 00:11:34.235 align:middle
Where do I do that, though?

00:11:34.319 --> 00:11:36.154 align:middle
All I can see is myself.

00:11:39.991 --> 00:11:43.411 align:middle
[laughs]

00:11:47.332 --> 00:11:49.876 align:middle
Takeda?

00:11:49.959 --> 00:11:51.753 align:middle
If you ever were to get sick.

00:11:51.836 --> 00:11:54.255 align:middle
I would take care of you, too.

00:11:54.339 --> 00:11:55.548 align:middle
Oh.

00:12:02.472 --> 00:12:03.682 align:middle
Huhh...

00:12:10.563 --> 00:12:12.774 align:middle
[phone rings]

00:12:15.443 --> 00:12:18.697 align:middle
Natsumi. Hey, what's up?

00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:20.824 align:middle
[NATSUMI] Looks like
you're well over your cold.

00:12:20.907 --> 00:12:22.325 align:middle
Uh-huh.

00:12:22.409 --> 00:12:24.577 align:middle
Next time you're sick, you
should really give me a call!

00:12:24.661 --> 00:12:26.705 align:middle
We can't have you
feeling all alone.

00:12:26.788 --> 00:12:30.125 align:middle
Or, did someone else maybe come
over and nurse you to health?

00:12:30.208 --> 00:12:31.835 align:middle
Wha--?
What're you talking about?

00:12:31.918 --> 00:12:33.461 align:middle
That would never happen!

00:12:33.545 --> 00:12:35.630 align:middle
You know there's
no such person, you jerk!

00:12:35.714 --> 00:12:38.341 align:middle
[NATSUMI]
The thing is, I saw you today.

00:12:38.425 --> 00:12:39.884 align:middle
And what did you see?

00:12:39.968 --> 00:12:40.802 align:middle
[NATSUMI]
You were walking around

00:12:40.885 --> 00:12:42.846 align:middle
with this really big, burly guy.

00:12:42.929 --> 00:12:45.390 align:middle
Uh! It's not what you think!

00:12:45.473 --> 00:12:47.809 align:middle
Takeda's just one of
my supervisors at work.

00:12:47.892 --> 00:12:50.603 align:middle
I was only helping him
pick out a smartphone!

00:12:50.687 --> 00:12:53.982 align:middle
Ohh. Sounds like kind of
an intimate thing to me.

00:12:54.065 --> 00:12:56.484 align:middle
I'm hanging up now
because I have to go to bed.

00:12:56.568 --> 00:12:58.528 align:middle
[NATSUMI]
Okay, talk to you later, then!

00:12:58.611 --> 00:13:00.447 align:middle
G'night!

00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:02.532 align:middle
Natsumi can be such a pain.

00:13:06.161 --> 00:13:07.912 align:middle
No contact yet.

00:13:11.833 --> 00:13:13.960 align:middle
Oh, so you got
yourself a smartphone.

00:13:14.044 --> 00:13:15.086 align:middle
Hey, Kazama?

00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:16.588 align:middle
Yeah?

00:13:16.671 --> 00:13:18.757 align:middle
How the heck do you send someone
a message on a smartphone?

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:19.758 align:middle
You're kidding, right?

00:13:19.841 --> 00:13:21.092 align:middle
I started trying last night,

00:13:21.176 --> 00:13:23.845 align:middle
and it's all I've
been doing ever since.

00:13:23.928 --> 00:13:26.639 align:middle
[KAZAMA] Just tap on
the word balloon icon.

00:13:26.723 --> 00:13:28.183 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Ohh...

00:13:29.976 --> 00:13:30.977 align:middle
Huh?

00:13:33.063 --> 00:13:34.272 align:middle
[SAKURAI]
Futaba?

00:13:34.356 --> 00:13:35.899 align:middle
Oh, hi, Sakurai!

00:13:35.982 --> 00:13:37.650 align:middle
What are you looking at?

00:13:37.734 --> 00:13:39.527 align:middle
It's nothing special at all.

00:13:39.611 --> 00:13:41.237 align:middle
Just some cute bear images.

00:13:41.321 --> 00:13:44.407 align:middle
Oh... I see Takeda's
in your contacts.

00:13:44.491 --> 00:13:46.034 align:middle
He finally got
a smartphone, huh?

00:13:46.117 --> 00:13:47.494 align:middle
Huh?!

00:13:47.577 --> 00:13:49.454 align:middle
Well, yeah, I guess?

00:13:49.537 --> 00:13:50.789 align:middle
[SAKURAI]
Hmm, hmm.

00:13:50.872 --> 00:13:52.332 align:middle
I mean,

00:13:52.415 --> 00:13:54.334 align:middle
I "heard" somewhere that Takeda
got a smartphone yesterday,

00:13:54.417 --> 00:13:58.004 align:middle
so I was just adding him
to my contacts, that's all.

00:13:58.088 --> 00:13:59.297 align:middle
Ohh...?

00:13:59.381 --> 00:14:00.715 align:middle
[phone beeps]

00:14:03.009 --> 00:14:05.011 align:middle
[SAKURAI]
She's so easy to read.

00:14:09.849 --> 00:14:13.103 align:middle
[KAZAMA] It took him five whole
minutes to send one text.

00:14:13.186 --> 00:14:14.396 align:middle
Oh, man!

00:14:14.479 --> 00:14:16.189 align:middle
I finally managed to send it.

00:14:16.272 --> 00:14:18.608 align:middle
Excellent, you should be proud.

00:14:29.035 --> 00:14:31.037 align:middle
[CHIEF] I think this is the
first time Takeda's taken off

00:14:31.121 --> 00:14:33.081 align:middle
since he started working here.

00:14:33.665 --> 00:14:35.291 align:middle
Wow, is that right?

00:14:35.375 --> 00:14:36.376 align:middle
Now that you mention it,

00:14:36.459 --> 00:14:38.253 align:middle
I don't remember him
ever being out.

00:14:38.336 --> 00:14:40.588 align:middle
And that time the flu was
going around like crazy,

00:14:40.672 --> 00:14:42.882 align:middle
he was the only one
who didn't get sick.

00:14:42.966 --> 00:14:45.468 align:middle
[OOISHI] I guess even Takeda
catches a cold sometimes.

00:14:45.552 --> 00:14:47.762 align:middle
[HIJIKATA] You wouldn't
think so, looking at him.

00:14:51.349 --> 00:14:53.935 align:middle
I wonder if he actually
caught his cold from me.

00:14:57.856 --> 00:14:59.691 align:middle
A cold, huh?

00:14:59.774 --> 00:15:01.693 align:middle
Sorry, I didn't
realize it was you.

00:15:01.776 --> 00:15:03.611 align:middle
Colds are no laughing
matter, though.

00:15:03.695 --> 00:15:06.239 align:middle
In Siberia,
they could mean death.

00:15:06.322 --> 00:15:09.409 align:middle
So, what are you
going to do, Futaba?

00:15:09.492 --> 00:15:11.703 align:middle
Aren't you gonna
go take care of him?

00:15:11.786 --> 00:15:13.872 align:middle
What do you mean? Why would I?

00:15:13.955 --> 00:15:16.124 align:middle
I'm not going.

00:15:16.207 --> 00:15:18.460 align:middle
I have to get back to work.

00:15:18.543 --> 00:15:20.045 align:middle
All right.

00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:24.257 align:middle
Touko.

00:15:25.592 --> 00:15:28.428 align:middle
Touko, Siberia cakes are tasty.

00:15:37.687 --> 00:15:41.358 align:middle
Man, c'mon,
why hasn't it gone down?

00:15:42.734 --> 00:15:44.527 align:middle
Jeez, I'm hungry.

00:15:44.611 --> 00:15:47.238 align:middle
And the fridge
is completely empty.

00:15:47.322 --> 00:15:49.449 align:middle
Guess I have to go out.

00:15:53.411 --> 00:15:55.538 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
This sucks.

00:15:57.248 --> 00:15:59.793 align:middle
[TAKEDA] Going to
the store is such a pain.

00:16:08.343 --> 00:16:09.594 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Igarashi?

00:16:09.678 --> 00:16:11.179 align:middle
Knowing you as well as I do,

00:16:11.262 --> 00:16:12.764 align:middle
I kinda figured you
might not be eating

00:16:12.847 --> 00:16:14.349 align:middle
all that well on your own,

00:16:14.432 --> 00:16:18.019 align:middle
and, uh, seeing as how you
took care of me the last time.

00:16:18.103 --> 00:16:23.650 align:middle
Uh, it seemed like,
maybe I should...

00:16:23.733 --> 00:16:26.319 align:middle
I came here to return the favor!

00:16:34.911 --> 00:16:36.830 align:middle
Okay, now.

00:16:36.913 --> 00:16:39.165 align:middle
Where are the
cooking chopsticks?

00:16:40.125 --> 00:16:42.419 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Not in here.

00:16:42.502 --> 00:16:45.463 align:middle
Takeda, where do you keep
your cooking chopsticks?

00:16:45.547 --> 00:16:49.092 align:middle
Uh... Lemme think,
where'd I put 'em.

00:16:49.175 --> 00:16:50.802 align:middle
Forget it!
Never mind, it's fine.

00:16:50.885 --> 00:16:52.721 align:middle
Please, just stay in bed.

00:16:53.513 --> 00:16:54.973 align:middle
A-ha! I found them!

00:16:55.056 --> 00:16:56.182 align:middle
I'm sorry.

00:16:56.266 --> 00:16:57.809 align:middle
[FUTABA]
No prob!

00:17:07.110 --> 00:17:08.945 align:middle
Now we just wait for a bit.

00:17:09.654 --> 00:17:11.698 align:middle
Where did I see
those potholders?

00:17:13.658 --> 00:17:14.826 align:middle
Wow, look at this thing.

00:17:14.909 --> 00:17:17.037 align:middle
I can't believe they
had them in his size.

00:17:19.122 --> 00:17:20.832 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Guess he's never used 'em.

00:17:21.666 --> 00:17:23.626 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Well, why would he need to?

00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:26.129 align:middle
His hands are
probably tough enough.

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:31.801 align:middle
[FUTABA]
From this angle,

00:17:31.885 --> 00:17:34.346 align:middle
it looks like something
very different.

00:17:39.517 --> 00:17:41.770 align:middle
Home run!

00:17:47.942 --> 00:17:49.527 align:middle
All right, your dinner's ready!

00:17:49.611 --> 00:17:50.862 align:middle
I went a little nuts.

00:17:50.945 --> 00:17:52.072 align:middle
Scallions and ginger.

00:17:52.155 --> 00:17:53.865 align:middle
Thank you.

00:17:53.948 --> 00:17:56.034 align:middle
Just try to be careful,
'cause it's hot.

00:17:56.117 --> 00:17:57.202 align:middle
Got it.

00:18:01.998 --> 00:18:04.000 align:middle
[FUTABA] I knew
he didn't need the mitt.

00:18:04.084 --> 00:18:06.002 align:middle
Looks wonderful.

00:18:09.631 --> 00:18:12.884 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Wow, this is seriously amazing!

00:18:12.967 --> 00:18:15.845 align:middle
You'll make someone
a great partner one day.

00:18:17.055 --> 00:18:19.057 align:middle
[FUTABA]
He did not!

00:18:22.185 --> 00:18:24.604 align:middle
So, uh, Takeda?

00:18:24.688 --> 00:18:27.732 align:middle
I assume you probably caught
your cold from me, didn't you?

00:18:27.816 --> 00:18:29.859 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Huh? Oh...

00:18:29.943 --> 00:18:31.027 align:middle
Actually, no.

00:18:31.111 --> 00:18:32.862 align:middle
I stood under
a waterfall as part of

00:18:32.946 --> 00:18:34.906 align:middle
my midwinter judo training.

00:18:34.989 --> 00:18:37.242 align:middle
You what?

00:18:39.994 --> 00:18:41.204 align:middle
Are you being serious?

00:18:41.287 --> 00:18:44.374 align:middle
[TAKEDA] Ugh...
Hard to believe, but yeah.

00:18:46.668 --> 00:18:49.254 align:middle
Man, Igarashi that was great!

00:18:49.337 --> 00:18:50.755 align:middle
Thank you very much.

00:18:50.839 --> 00:18:52.716 align:middle
You're welcome!
I'm so glad.

00:18:55.635 --> 00:18:57.512 align:middle
Now you need to get
some good sleep.

00:18:57.595 --> 00:18:59.222 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Sorry to trouble you.

00:18:59.305 --> 00:19:00.598 align:middle
[FUTABA]
You didn't.

00:19:24.497 --> 00:19:26.416 align:middle
[FUTABA] Sheer momentum
may have brought me here,

00:19:26.499 --> 00:19:30.045 align:middle
but I've never actually
been in a guy's room before!

00:19:45.518 --> 00:19:47.604 align:middle
He's fast asleep.

00:19:47.687 --> 00:19:50.732 align:middle
I wonder if I've
returned the favor now?

00:19:52.150 --> 00:19:55.320 align:middle
[FUTABA] His face looks so
peaceful when he's asleep.

00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:04.079 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Come to think of it,

00:20:04.162 --> 00:20:07.540 align:middle
he's always got a bit
of a beard going here.

00:20:07.624 --> 00:20:10.043 align:middle
Oh, jeez! It's so prickly!

00:20:11.169 --> 00:20:13.004 align:middle
What are you doing?

00:20:23.223 --> 00:20:24.724 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Get well soon!

00:20:29.437 --> 00:20:31.064 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Could this get any worse?

00:20:31.147 --> 00:20:32.315 align:middle
He saw what I did!

00:20:32.399 --> 00:20:35.985 align:middle
What the heck came
over me, anyway?

00:20:39.239 --> 00:20:40.907 align:middle
[TAKEDA yawns]

00:20:49.708 --> 00:20:53.086 align:middle
I hope she'll come back and
cook for me again sometime.

00:20:53.169 --> 00:20:55.005 align:middle
That was good.

00:20:58.258 --> 00:20:59.968 align:middle
Mornin'!

00:21:00.051 --> 00:21:01.803 align:middle
Uh. Hey, g'morning.

00:21:01.886 --> 00:21:03.263 align:middle
Good morning, Takeda.

00:21:03.346 --> 00:21:04.389 align:middle
Are you feeling better?

00:21:04.472 --> 00:21:05.432 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Sure am!

00:21:05.515 --> 00:21:07.017 align:middle
Sorry to put you guys out.

00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:08.727 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Good morning.

00:21:09.227 --> 00:21:11.479 align:middle
I'm glad to see
you're feeling better.

00:21:15.233 --> 00:21:16.901 align:middle
Wha...? What is it?

00:21:19.571 --> 00:21:21.573 align:middle
Hey, what the heck is with you?

00:21:21.656 --> 00:21:24.159 align:middle
Thanks so much for
coming over to visit!

00:21:24.242 --> 00:21:25.910 align:middle
Made my day!

00:21:27.037 --> 00:21:29.039 align:middle
Futaba, I could've
sworn you told me

00:21:29.122 --> 00:21:31.166 align:middle
you weren't going over to visit?

00:21:31.249 --> 00:21:34.586 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Hey. Why? Why?

00:21:34.669 --> 00:21:36.421 align:middle
Why did you have to tell them?

00:21:36.504 --> 00:21:38.631 align:middle
Wait. I assumed you had.

00:21:38.715 --> 00:21:40.842 align:middle
Did Igarashi visit you at home?

00:21:40.925 --> 00:21:43.386 align:middle
Yeah! She came over
while I wasn't feeling well.

00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:45.055 align:middle
Igarashi's cooking is so g--

00:21:45.138 --> 00:21:45.889 align:middle
Are you kidding me?

00:21:45.972 --> 00:21:47.515 align:middle
Don't say another word!

00:21:47.599 --> 00:21:49.601 align:middle
Oh, wow, you
even cooked for him?

00:21:49.684 --> 00:21:51.936 align:middle
That's great.

00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:53.938 align:middle
Maybe I'll try, too.

00:21:56.024 --> 00:21:58.735 align:middle
[FUTABA]
This sucks!

00:21:58.818 --> 00:22:00.028 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Hmm?

00:22:02.197 --> 00:22:04.157 align:middle
Please never say
anything like that again,

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:05.617 align:middle
it's embarrassing!

00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:08.036 align:middle
C'mon, I don't think it's
anything to get upset about.

00:22:08.119 --> 00:22:09.746 align:middle
Your cooking rocks.

00:22:10.663 --> 00:22:13.917 align:middle
Well, I guess if you really
like it as much as all that,

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.461 align:middle
I could make you something
else sometime, if you want.

00:22:16.544 --> 00:22:17.796 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Hmm...

00:22:17.879 --> 00:22:19.297 align:middle
How 'bout a Hamburg steak?

00:22:19.381 --> 00:22:21.800 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Hmm? You're making requests now?
