WEBVTT

00:00:02.983 --> 00:00:06.069
Goodness. This is
incredibly well organized.

00:00:06.153 --> 00:00:06.987
Good work!

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:09.948
Oh, wow, thank you so much, sir!

00:00:10.032 --> 00:00:11.199
[TAKEDA]
Whoa!

00:00:11.283 --> 00:00:13.618
Did you finish compiling
those documents already?

00:00:13.702 --> 00:00:16.079
Yep, the chief even
complimented me!

00:00:17.581 --> 00:00:18.915
That's fantastic!

00:00:18.999 --> 00:00:20.250
I'm happy for you!

00:00:20.334 --> 00:00:22.669
[FUTABA grumbles]

00:00:22.753 --> 00:00:24.504
For the last time already,

00:00:24.588 --> 00:00:26.256
I hate when you tousle my hair!

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.467
How many times
do I have to say it?

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.220
You always treat me like a
child, and it drives me crazy!

00:00:32.304 --> 00:00:34.139
I don't care what you
think I look like.

00:00:34.222 --> 00:00:36.725
I am a strong, independent,
grown-up woman!

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.606
[laughs]

00:00:42.689 --> 00:00:43.774
[FUTABA]
I'll show you.

00:00:43.857 --> 00:00:45.442
One day I'm gonna be
so good at this job

00:00:45.525 --> 00:00:47.778
you'll have to rely on me
like a fellow adult!

00:00:47.861 --> 00:00:50.113
So, you'd better watch
your back, you hear me?

00:00:50.197 --> 00:00:51.907
[TAKEDA]
Was that a threat?

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:54.534
And what the heck are you
talking about, "one day"?

00:00:54.618 --> 00:00:56.870
I feel like
I rely on you plenty.

00:00:56.953 --> 00:00:59.164
[FUTABA]
Huh? Do you really?

00:00:59.247 --> 00:01:00.499
Of course I do!

00:01:00.582 --> 00:01:02.125
Your cooking is incredible!

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:04.753
That has nothing to do
with work, you doofus!

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.179
I have some
exciting news to share!

00:02:37.262 --> 00:02:38.889
Thanks to Takeda, here,

00:02:38.972 --> 00:02:41.725
we just landed a big
contract with a major client!

00:02:41.808 --> 00:02:43.560
Let's give him a hand!

00:02:43.644 --> 00:02:45.437
Aw, it was just a
matter of good timing,

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.272
I couldn't have done it
without you all!

00:02:49.441 --> 00:02:51.443
Takeda's a pretty
impressive guy, huh?

00:02:51.526 --> 00:02:52.986
Oh, yeah, he's cool.

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.238
And he always looks so imposing.

00:02:55.322 --> 00:02:58.033
[HIJIKATA] Right? How does
a guy even get that buff?

00:03:00.369 --> 00:03:01.828
[sighs]

00:03:01.912 --> 00:03:05.082
He deserves this win;
he's been working so hard.

00:03:06.625 --> 00:03:07.834
Hello there.

00:03:07.918 --> 00:03:09.586
[FUTABA screams]

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:10.671
Mona, I am begging you

00:03:10.754 --> 00:03:12.673
to stop sneaking up
on me like that!

00:03:12.756 --> 00:03:14.216
[TSUKISHIRO]
Sorry.

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:16.677
Why were you smiling
to yourself just now?

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.095
[FUTABA]
Huh?

00:03:19.179 --> 00:03:20.555
[TSUKISHIRO]
Something good happen?

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:23.141
[FUTABA]
Oh, well, Yeah!

00:03:23.225 --> 00:03:26.853
Not to me, but Takeda
just landed a huge contract

00:03:26.937 --> 00:03:30.148
with a new client.
I'm pretty excited for him.

00:03:30.232 --> 00:03:31.650
[TSUKISHIRO]
Well, kudos!

00:03:31.733 --> 00:03:32.818
Uh. Say what?

00:03:32.901 --> 00:03:34.152
[TSUKISHIRO]
Not to you, to him.

00:03:34.236 --> 00:03:35.320
That's a great accomplishment.

00:03:35.404 --> 00:03:37.572
Yeah, you're right.
It really is!

00:03:37.656 --> 00:03:40.659
And yet he still insists it was
just a matter of good timing.

00:03:40.742 --> 00:03:43.620
Oh, how modest of him,
He's pretty amazing.

00:03:43.704 --> 00:03:45.288
[FUTABA]
You have no idea!

00:03:45.372 --> 00:03:46.665
He's amazingly amazing!

00:03:46.748 --> 00:03:48.583
He really does
deserve all the credit.

00:03:48.667 --> 00:03:51.962
So then, what exactly are you
so happy about, Igarashi?

00:03:52.045 --> 00:03:54.256
[FUTABA]
Uh...

00:03:54.339 --> 00:03:57.509
Oh, nothing, I guess it's just--

00:03:57.592 --> 00:03:59.303
I'm happy on Takeda's behalf!

00:03:59.386 --> 00:04:00.679
I mean,
he took me under his wing

00:04:00.762 --> 00:04:02.472
basically the second
we met, so I'm just trying

00:04:02.556 --> 00:04:04.391
to be supportive or
whatever! That's it!

00:04:04.474 --> 00:04:06.518
[TSUKISHIRO]
Okay, so you respect him.

00:04:06.601 --> 00:04:09.521
Huh? Or do you like him?

00:04:11.898 --> 00:04:14.026
[FUTABA]
I feel like I'm still blushing.

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:16.903
Why did she have
to make it so weird?

00:04:17.738 --> 00:04:19.031
Huh?

00:04:20.282 --> 00:04:22.075
[FUTABA] Are you already
filling out onboarding paperwork

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:23.952
for that new client?

00:04:24.036 --> 00:04:25.370
Yup.

00:04:25.454 --> 00:04:27.289
[FUTABA]
Can I do anything to help?

00:04:27.372 --> 00:04:28.373
I'm about done.

00:04:28.457 --> 00:04:30.500
Thanks, though.

00:04:30.584 --> 00:04:32.210
No problem.

00:04:36.798 --> 00:04:37.883
[NATSUMI]
Ahh...

00:04:37.966 --> 00:04:39.676
Sounds like he really
rocks at his job.

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.680
Yeah, only, when he does
everything himself like this,

00:04:43.764 --> 00:04:46.224
it makes me feel kinda useless.

00:04:46.308 --> 00:04:47.476
[NATSUMI]
Hmm...

00:04:47.559 --> 00:04:49.895
So, you're lonely 'cause
he doesn't rely on you?

00:04:49.978 --> 00:04:52.981
[FUTABA] Hmm? No!
That's not what I said, shut up!

00:04:53.065 --> 00:04:54.566
It isn't like that.

00:04:56.652 --> 00:04:57.694
[NATSUMI]
I'll see ya later.

00:04:57.778 --> 00:04:58.862
[FUTABA]
Mm.

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:02.699
[FUTABA]
I've been working so hard

00:05:02.783 --> 00:05:05.535
to become a
full-fledged salesperson,

00:05:05.619 --> 00:05:08.789
but... I get the feeling that
Takeda still thinks of me

00:05:08.872 --> 00:05:11.375
like I'm just another rookie.

00:05:19.883 --> 00:05:21.009
[FUTABA] I wonder when
I'll finally be able

00:05:21.093 --> 00:05:24.388
to stand on my own
two feet for real.

00:05:30.018 --> 00:05:31.228
[FUTABA]
Is there a problem?

00:05:31.311 --> 00:05:32.437
Looks like.

00:05:32.521 --> 00:05:34.606
Client asked me to come
see 'em immediately.

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:37.275
[FUTABA] But you have
a presentation to give!

00:05:37.359 --> 00:05:40.404
[sighs]
Guess I'll reschedule.

00:05:40.487 --> 00:05:41.446
No, don't!

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:43.448
What if I gave it
for you instead?

00:05:43.532 --> 00:05:44.533
[TAKEDA]
Hmm?

00:05:44.616 --> 00:05:46.576
Let me give the
presentation for you.

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:48.829
I did help to
prepare it, after all.

00:05:48.912 --> 00:05:51.081
Plus, we visit
this client all the time,

00:05:51.164 --> 00:05:54.126
so I already know what
they're going to expect.

00:05:54.209 --> 00:05:56.169
But you'll be alone, you sure?

00:05:56.253 --> 00:05:57.879
I'm positive!

00:06:01.717 --> 00:06:02.926
I'm counting on you.

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:04.219
You got it?

00:06:04.303 --> 00:06:05.595
Ah! Yes!

00:06:05.679 --> 00:06:06.972
I won't let you down!

00:06:07.055 --> 00:06:08.598
Go get 'em, champ!

00:06:12.602 --> 00:06:14.104
Good luck out there, Futaba!

00:06:14.187 --> 00:06:15.314
Yeah, take care!

00:06:15.397 --> 00:06:17.649
Thank you! Be back soon!

00:06:20.444 --> 00:06:23.196
[FUTABA]
Don't worry! You can do it!

00:06:27.993 --> 00:06:29.995
[FUTABA]
Takeda has taught you so much,

00:06:30.078 --> 00:06:32.581
and he's always
been there for you.

00:06:32.664 --> 00:06:33.874
So...

00:06:35.751 --> 00:06:38.045
[FUTABA]
Now it's your turn to help him!

00:06:39.504 --> 00:06:40.964
[FUTABA]
May I come in?

00:06:44.384 --> 00:06:46.678
Hey! Yeah, I'm done!

00:06:46.762 --> 00:06:48.347
I think it went really well!

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:50.390
They were pretty happy
with our proposal.

00:06:50.474 --> 00:06:52.225
They said it's fine as-is!

00:06:52.309 --> 00:06:53.393
[TAKEDA]
That's great!

00:06:53.477 --> 00:06:55.812
You're a lifesaver, Igarashi.
Thank you!

00:06:55.896 --> 00:06:58.440
Of course!
I'll be back soon!

00:07:00.692 --> 00:07:02.694
[FUTABA]
I did it!

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:12.829
After a hard day's work,
this udon really hits the spot!

00:07:12.913 --> 00:07:14.623
[laughter]

00:07:14.706 --> 00:07:16.583
Ah, come on,
I doubt it was that funny.

00:07:16.667 --> 00:07:19.252
[MAN B]
No, it was hilarious.

00:07:19.336 --> 00:07:21.630
[FUTABA]
You know, it's been a long time

00:07:21.713 --> 00:07:25.175
since I've gone out
to lunch by myself.

00:07:25.258 --> 00:07:28.011
[MAN B] He kept saying,
"just one more bar, I swear!"

00:07:28.095 --> 00:07:29.513
And we wound up
going to five more.

00:07:29.596 --> 00:07:31.598
[MAN A] And you ended up...?
Yeah, that sounds like him.

00:07:39.064 --> 00:07:40.565
[TAKEDA]
I'm back!

00:07:42.067 --> 00:07:43.902
Hey, how'd it go--?

00:07:43.986 --> 00:07:44.945
'Bout time you got back!

00:07:45.028 --> 00:07:46.238
So is it true?

00:07:46.321 --> 00:07:48.740
We heard you landed
a huge contract!

00:07:48.824 --> 00:07:50.617
We should go out and celebrate!

00:07:50.701 --> 00:07:52.202
[EMPLOYEE D] I know of
a really high-class place

00:07:52.285 --> 00:07:53.495
that would be perfect!

00:07:53.578 --> 00:07:54.746
Yeah, please come!

00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:56.415
We've been dying
to hear the details!

00:07:56.498 --> 00:07:58.834
Someone's popular with
the ladies all of a sudden.

00:07:58.917 --> 00:08:01.712
Well, yeah. After landing that
insane contract with those guys,

00:08:01.795 --> 00:08:04.172
he's the new office rock star.

00:08:04.256 --> 00:08:05.465
[HIJIKATA]
Is that all it takes?

00:08:05.549 --> 00:08:06.675
I'll land one twice as big

00:08:06.758 --> 00:08:08.260
and then the ladies'll
come flocking to me!

00:08:08.343 --> 00:08:09.970
[OOISHI]
Sure they will.

00:08:10.262 --> 00:08:14.683
[FUTABA] What is this
feeling inside my chest?

00:08:16.018 --> 00:08:18.478
[TAKEDA]
Hey, Igarashi. You good?

00:08:18.562 --> 00:08:19.521
[FUTABA]
Hm?

00:08:19.604 --> 00:08:21.481
Never better, why, what's up?

00:08:21.565 --> 00:08:23.525
You just looked kinda out of it.

00:08:23.608 --> 00:08:26.278
Uh. Well, I'm not, don't worry.

00:08:26.361 --> 00:08:27.612
[TAKEDA]
Hmm?

00:08:27.696 --> 00:08:29.740
Thanks for your help today!

00:08:29.823 --> 00:08:31.658
Sure thing.

00:08:31.742 --> 00:08:33.994
So, where's the
big party gonna be?

00:08:34.077 --> 00:08:35.370
Huh?

00:08:35.454 --> 00:08:37.748
Thought those women
were taking you to celebrate.

00:08:37.831 --> 00:08:39.708
They asked but, no thanks.

00:08:39.791 --> 00:08:41.626
[FUTABA]
Huh? Wait, why?

00:08:41.710 --> 00:08:43.003
[TAKEDA]
Hmm...

00:08:43.086 --> 00:08:46.631
Well, I enjoy going out
for a drink with coworkers,

00:08:46.715 --> 00:08:49.134
but I'm not exactly
big on parties,

00:08:49.217 --> 00:08:51.219
especially if they're
being thrown for me.

00:08:51.303 --> 00:08:56.058
Uh... I'm amazed how shy
you can be sometimes.

00:08:56.141 --> 00:08:57.684
Listen, if you're the
reason everyone wants

00:08:57.768 --> 00:09:02.230
to celebrate in the first place,
you're basically required to go!

00:09:02.314 --> 00:09:04.107
[TAKEDA]
Uh... I dunno.

00:09:04.191 --> 00:09:05.859
You're an adult,
and it'll reflect poorly on you

00:09:05.942 --> 00:09:08.820
if you skip just because
you're "not big on parties."

00:09:08.904 --> 00:09:11.615
[FUTABA] And besides,
you said it yourself, remember?

00:09:11.698 --> 00:09:14.493
This is everybody's win,
not just yours!

00:09:15.452 --> 00:09:19.331
Never figured I'd hear
a lecture like that outta you.

00:09:19.414 --> 00:09:20.290
You win!

00:09:20.374 --> 00:09:22.668
I'll tell them I'm going.

00:09:22.751 --> 00:09:25.212
So, uh, you wanna
be my plus one?

00:09:25.295 --> 00:09:27.130
No, I think I'll
sit this one out.

00:09:27.214 --> 00:09:28.548
It's your party!

00:09:28.632 --> 00:09:31.176
Go let 'em make you the
center of attention for a while!

00:09:31.259 --> 00:09:32.970
[TAKEDA]
Suit yourself.

00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:39.184
[FUTABA] It's weird, I'm really
happy that all his hard work

00:09:39.267 --> 00:09:42.729
is being recognized, but--

00:09:42.813 --> 00:09:46.692
I don't want to see the
ladies fawning all over him.

00:09:46.775 --> 00:09:47.985
We're ready when you are!

00:09:48.068 --> 00:09:51.029
I didn't know there
would be this many of you!

00:09:52.656 --> 00:09:54.199
[FUTABA]
Guess I'll head home.

00:09:55.158 --> 00:09:56.952
This place is supposed
to have pretty good ramen.

00:09:57.035 --> 00:09:58.286
It looks amazing!

00:09:58.370 --> 00:09:59.496
[HIJIKATA]
That's great to hear!

00:09:59.579 --> 00:10:01.748
I for one am very particular
about my ramen.

00:10:01.832 --> 00:10:03.291
[OOISHI] I thought you
said it all tastes the same.

00:10:03.375 --> 00:10:04.668
[HIJIKATA]
Shut yer face.

00:10:10.632 --> 00:10:12.217
[YUTO]
Kurobe!

00:10:14.886 --> 00:10:16.054
[YUTO]
What a coincidence!

00:10:16.138 --> 00:10:17.097
[NATSUMI]
You training?

00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:18.015
[YUTO]
Uh-huh!

00:10:18.098 --> 00:10:19.516
I run every day now!

00:10:19.599 --> 00:10:22.853
Basketball club's hardcore,
I'm just trying to catch up.

00:10:22.936 --> 00:10:25.856
If you're working this hard,
you must enjoy it.

00:10:25.939 --> 00:10:27.399
[YUTO]
It's a lot of fun!

00:10:27.482 --> 00:10:31.528
I'm not very good yet, but,
ugh, talking and running again.

00:10:31.611 --> 00:10:33.405
you do that on purpose, right?

00:10:33.488 --> 00:10:34.990
[NATSUMI]
Yep, helps your breathing.

00:10:35.073 --> 00:10:35.866
Wanna walk?

00:10:35.949 --> 00:10:37.743
Nope, I can do this!

00:10:40.329 --> 00:10:42.039
No answer, welp.

00:10:44.791 --> 00:10:46.335
Grandpa?

00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:02.684
[FUTABA] I'm really in
the mood for a drink tonight,

00:11:02.768 --> 00:11:06.563
but who wants to walk
into an <i>izakaya</i> all alone?

00:11:07.981 --> 00:11:09.483
[WAITER]
Evenin'! How many?

00:11:09.566 --> 00:11:10.692
Just me.

00:11:10.776 --> 00:11:12.903
[WAITER] Come on in!
Grab a seat at the bar!

00:11:12.986 --> 00:11:14.905
[FUTABA] I'm a full-fledged
salesperson now!

00:11:14.988 --> 00:11:17.366
I got this!

00:11:17.449 --> 00:11:19.034
Evening! Welcome!

00:11:19.117 --> 00:11:20.911
How many in your party tonight?

00:11:20.994 --> 00:11:22.329
Uh, one, I guess?

00:11:22.412 --> 00:11:24.331
I'm actually here
by myself this time.

00:11:24.414 --> 00:11:25.248
'S that okay?

00:11:25.332 --> 00:11:26.458
[WAITER]
Yeah, no prob!

00:11:26.541 --> 00:11:27.542
Counter's always open!

00:11:27.626 --> 00:11:28.627
[EMPLOYEE AA]
Did she really say that?

00:11:37.928 --> 00:11:39.346
[EMPLOYEE BB]
I'll do my very best, sir!

00:11:39.429 --> 00:11:41.223
I'm looking forward to
working with all of you!

00:11:41.306 --> 00:11:42.432
Back at ya', rookie!

00:11:42.516 --> 00:11:43.475
Welcome to the fold!

00:11:43.558 --> 00:11:45.102
[EMPLOYEE DD]
Cheers, bud!

00:11:46.186 --> 00:11:47.980
I remember when
I was a new hire.

00:11:48.063 --> 00:11:49.773
Seems like forever ago.

00:11:52.401 --> 00:11:54.569
My name is Futaba Igarashi.

00:11:54.653 --> 00:11:57.739
I'm starting here today.
It's nice to meet you all!

00:12:07.749 --> 00:12:09.418
[SAKURAI]
Miss Igarashi?

00:12:09.501 --> 00:12:11.878
I'm Touko Sakurai, Welcome!

00:12:13.797 --> 00:12:16.717
Thank you, I really appreciate
that, Miss Sakurai.

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:17.843
If I may--

00:12:17.926 --> 00:12:19.094
[FUTABA]
Yes?

00:12:19.177 --> 00:12:21.763
Do you have any kind of
nickname I can call you?

00:12:23.223 --> 00:12:25.142
Not really, why do you ask?

00:12:25.225 --> 00:12:26.351
You're way too little and cute

00:12:26.435 --> 00:12:29.021
to keep calling you
"Miss Igarashi"!

00:12:29.104 --> 00:12:32.190
Miss Sakurai! Yes, I will
concede that I do indeed possess

00:12:32.274 --> 00:12:34.151
somewhat childlike
physical features.

00:12:34.234 --> 00:12:35.402
However!

00:12:35.485 --> 00:12:37.321
Despite my stature
and status in this office,

00:12:37.404 --> 00:12:38.405
you should keep in mind

00:12:38.488 --> 00:12:40.407
that I'm an adult
member of society!

00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:43.201
Thus, it is inappropriate
to treat me like a child!

00:12:43.285 --> 00:12:47.205
Oh, well, may I just
call you "Futaba" then?

00:12:47.289 --> 00:12:49.166
[FUTABA]
Did you hear a word I said?

00:12:49.249 --> 00:12:51.001
I am of the opinion
that those forms of address

00:12:51.084 --> 00:12:53.170
are far too casual for
someone you've just met,

00:12:53.253 --> 00:12:55.130
so please refrain.

00:12:55.213 --> 00:12:56.715
Miss Futaba,
where are you going?

00:12:56.798 --> 00:12:58.759
I'm going to get a drink!

00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:06.224
[FUTABA] I know I never really
hit a growth spurt, but come on!

00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:09.728
Miss Sakurai with her
stupid perfect figure.

00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:13.190
What the--?

00:13:13.273 --> 00:13:14.816
Whoa.

00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:17.444
This guy is huge!

00:13:18.362 --> 00:13:20.447
Hey. Haven't seen you before.

00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:21.573
[FUTABA]
Omigosh I'm so so sorry,

00:13:21.657 --> 00:13:22.616
I should've been
paying more attention

00:13:22.699 --> 00:13:23.867
to where I was going!

00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:25.827
Nah, it's all good.
Don't sweat it!

00:13:25.911 --> 00:13:27.204
You here to get a drink, too?

00:13:27.287 --> 00:13:28.747
[FUTABA]
Uh, yes.

00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:30.165
Which one?

00:13:30.248 --> 00:13:31.375
[FUTABA]
<i>Oshiruko.</i>

00:13:31.458 --> 00:13:32.834
[TAKEDA]
Okie doke.

00:13:33.502 --> 00:13:36.880
It's my treat, Catch!

00:13:36.963 --> 00:13:39.341
Thanks, I appreciate it,

00:13:42.761 --> 00:13:44.012
[sighs]

00:13:44.096 --> 00:13:46.974
[FUTABA]
So... Do you work in sales?

00:13:47.057 --> 00:13:48.016
Yeah!

00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:49.559
Had to visit a
client this morning,

00:13:49.643 --> 00:13:52.354
so I'm a little late, I ran here
straight from their office,

00:13:52.437 --> 00:13:53.939
so I am parched!

00:13:54.022 --> 00:13:55.399
Uh-huh.

00:13:55.482 --> 00:13:57.192
He seems like a pretty nice guy.

00:13:57.275 --> 00:13:59.277
That's good, Oh, wait!

00:13:59.361 --> 00:14:01.196
I should introduce myself!

00:14:01.279 --> 00:14:02.447
By the way, today's my first--

00:14:02.531 --> 00:14:03.657
[TAKEDA]
Oh, yeah,

00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:06.076
d'you come here on a
field trip or something?

00:14:06.159 --> 00:14:08.453
I do remember someone saying
some junior high students

00:14:08.537 --> 00:14:10.497
would be visiting this week.

00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:12.958
You're a wee little
thing, ain't cha?

00:14:13.041 --> 00:14:14.167
But don't you worry.

00:14:14.251 --> 00:14:15.794
Just eat a lot. You'll grow!

00:14:15.877 --> 00:14:17.754
Your whole life's ahead of ya!

00:14:21.008 --> 00:14:21.967
Bye, kid!

00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:23.051
I gotta go meet the new guy

00:14:23.135 --> 00:14:25.387
I'm supposed to be
showin' the ropes!

00:14:30.434 --> 00:14:31.935
[TAKEDA]
Hey, Kazama!

00:14:32.019 --> 00:14:33.478
I didn't know that
junior high tour

00:14:33.562 --> 00:14:35.147
was this early in the week.

00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:37.024
Huh? That's because it isn't.

00:14:37.107 --> 00:14:38.525
What?

00:14:38.608 --> 00:14:41.820
There was a girl walking around
who I swear was 13 or so.

00:14:41.903 --> 00:14:43.613
Yeah, no, I think
she might've been--

00:14:43.697 --> 00:14:44.448
[CHIEF]
Takeda!

00:14:44.531 --> 00:14:45.699
May I speak with you?

00:14:45.782 --> 00:14:46.575
Sure thing!

00:14:46.658 --> 00:14:48.660
Be right there. Sorry.

00:14:48.744 --> 00:14:50.871
Hold that thought, yeah?

00:14:50.954 --> 00:14:52.456
[FUTABA]
Hey, I'm back.

00:14:52.539 --> 00:14:56.043
[KAZAMA] Igarashi,
did you happen to run into--

00:14:56.126 --> 00:14:57.127
What?

00:14:57.210 --> 00:14:59.212
[KAZAMA]
Nothing. Sorry. Never mind.

00:15:00.255 --> 00:15:02.049
[KAZAMA] Looks like he
screwed up big time.

00:15:02.132 --> 00:15:03.884
What's the matter?

00:15:03.967 --> 00:15:04.926
[TAKEDA]
Mornin', Chief.

00:15:05.010 --> 00:15:06.428
Sorry, I'm late.

00:15:06.511 --> 00:15:08.263
Oh, no problem at all,

00:15:08.347 --> 00:15:09.973
but you'll need
to meet the new hire,

00:15:10.057 --> 00:15:12.267
I've already had
her introduce herself.

00:15:12.351 --> 00:15:14.978
Igarashi, come say hello!

00:15:15.062 --> 00:15:18.273
Good morning! I'll be
working with you starting--

00:15:18.357 --> 00:15:19.399
--Huh?
--Huh?

00:15:19.483 --> 00:15:21.401
[CHIEF]
Oh! You two are acquainted?

00:15:21.485 --> 00:15:22.402
You're a grown-up?

00:15:22.486 --> 00:15:24.112
I thought you were a little kid!

00:15:24.196 --> 00:15:26.907
Well, excuse me
for not being a mountain!

00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:28.492
Not him. Not now.

00:15:28.575 --> 00:15:29.910
[CHIEF]
I-I'm terribly sorry,

00:15:29.993 --> 00:15:31.870
but you're already slated
to work together.

00:15:31.953 --> 00:15:34.748
Takeda, do you have
any idea what's wrong here?

00:15:34.831 --> 00:15:36.875
I might. A little bit.

00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:39.753
In any case, I understand
you may not be thrilled

00:15:39.836 --> 00:15:41.046
with this particular
partnership,

00:15:41.129 --> 00:15:42.547
but, as long as
you're in this office,

00:15:42.631 --> 00:15:45.133
he is your supervisor
and you his subordinate.

00:15:45.217 --> 00:15:47.135
So let's try to get along, okay?

00:15:47.928 --> 00:15:52.182
[TAKEDA] Hey, are... you still
mad at me for earlier?

00:15:52.265 --> 00:15:54.643
Not as mad as I could be.

00:15:58.522 --> 00:16:00.440
[FUTABA]
But, since we can't very well

00:16:00.524 --> 00:16:02.818
get out of it at this point,

00:16:03.902 --> 00:16:07.614
I look forward to working
together; I'll do my best.

00:16:09.866 --> 00:16:10.993
[TAKEDA]
Yeah.

00:16:11.076 --> 00:16:12.869
Same here, Igarashi.

00:16:14.913 --> 00:16:18.959
[FUTABA] He's been annoying me
from the day we first met,

00:16:19.042 --> 00:16:23.296
but we've been
together ever since.

00:16:28.510 --> 00:16:33.515
[FUTABA]
Side by side, through so much.

00:16:36.393 --> 00:16:41.732
[FUTABA cries]

00:16:41.815 --> 00:16:46.069
Hey! What's a grade schooler
doin' at the bar?

00:16:46.153 --> 00:16:48.405
I'm not a grade schooler,
you weirdo.

00:16:48.488 --> 00:16:51.325
Nah, you don't need to be
by yerself in a place like this.

00:16:51.408 --> 00:16:52.784
Where's yer momma at?

00:16:52.868 --> 00:16:54.411
You mind if I park it here?

00:16:54.494 --> 00:16:56.997
Uh, hey, I do, actually,
so please leave.

00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:59.708
Ah, c'mon, don't be like that!

00:16:59.791 --> 00:17:02.336
You're all alone and junk!

00:17:05.797 --> 00:17:07.966
Ah, don't cry, little girl!

00:17:08.050 --> 00:17:10.510
I'll stay right here with ya
till yer mom comes back.

00:17:10.594 --> 00:17:11.803
[FUTABA]
Don't!

00:17:14.514 --> 00:17:15.849
Huh?

00:17:21.772 --> 00:17:23.023
Who're you?

00:17:23.106 --> 00:17:25.025
[TAKEDA]
I'm her supervisor.

00:17:27.944 --> 00:17:29.696
Huh? [gasps]

00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:30.906
Has he been bothering you?

00:17:30.989 --> 00:17:33.033
I'm so sorry for
the disturbance!

00:17:33.116 --> 00:17:36.119
You can't go around
bothering people like that!

00:17:38.705 --> 00:17:39.873
[TAKEDA sighs]

00:17:39.956 --> 00:17:41.458
Gimme a draft!

00:17:41.541 --> 00:17:44.169
[WAITER]
One draft beer, coming right up!

00:17:44.252 --> 00:17:45.420
[FUTABA]
What's the deal?

00:17:45.504 --> 00:17:47.130
I thought you were going
to that party tonight.

00:17:47.214 --> 00:17:48.799
Yeah, I swung by.

00:17:48.882 --> 00:17:51.969
Showed up, said a few words,
and took off.

00:17:52.052 --> 00:17:53.720
You didn't feel bad
leaving early?

00:17:53.804 --> 00:17:55.347
[TAKEDA]
Not really.

00:17:55.430 --> 00:17:58.100
Once I got there,
I got to thinking a little.

00:17:59.601 --> 00:18:03.605
And I decided, I'd rather
be here drinking with you.

00:18:03.689 --> 00:18:05.232
[FUTABA]
Huh?

00:18:06.316 --> 00:18:08.694
[FUTABA] Come on,
what are ya' talking about?

00:18:08.777 --> 00:18:10.946
[TAKEDA laughs]

00:18:11.905 --> 00:18:13.740
Unbelievable.

00:18:18.745 --> 00:18:20.914
You're really puttin' 'em
away today, aren't ya'?

00:18:20.998 --> 00:18:22.457
Well, it ain't my fault!

00:18:22.541 --> 00:18:24.876
I blame you for being
so weird all the time!

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:27.087
[TAKEDA]
What? What'd I do?

00:18:28.255 --> 00:18:31.049
[FUTABA grumbles]

00:18:33.552 --> 00:18:35.679
[FUTABA]
I guess it's just,

00:18:35.762 --> 00:18:38.724
sometimes I get
the feeling that--

00:18:42.686 --> 00:18:44.062
[TAKEDA]
Huh? That what?

00:18:44.146 --> 00:18:46.940
[FUTABA]
Oh, uh, n-never mind.

00:18:47.024 --> 00:18:49.234
Look, I just realized
you must really like me,

00:18:49.318 --> 00:18:52.237
and it's freaking me out!

00:18:52.321 --> 00:18:56.450
Okay, Why did I start
to say that again?

00:18:56.533 --> 00:18:59.661
[TAKEDA] I think a lot about
the first time we came here.

00:18:59.745 --> 00:19:03.874
Well, I think about
every time we come here.

00:19:03.957 --> 00:19:06.585
Sitting and drinking,
just the two of us.

00:19:07.461 --> 00:19:08.795
What's gotten into you?

00:19:08.879 --> 00:19:09.838
What's wrong?

00:19:09.921 --> 00:19:11.131
Nothing is wrong!

00:19:11.214 --> 00:19:14.051
I just mean compared
to back then,

00:19:14.134 --> 00:19:17.012
Igarashi, you've grown a lot.

00:19:21.016 --> 00:19:23.810
[FUTABA]
Well, that's all thanks to you.

00:19:23.894 --> 00:19:26.396
I know I've put
you through a lot,

00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:29.399
and I'm sure I was
a pretty sassy rookie.

00:19:29.483 --> 00:19:32.653
But, not only did you
not let that get to you,

00:19:32.736 --> 00:19:34.988
you went out of your way
to look after me,

00:19:35.072 --> 00:19:38.283
and, I'm just grateful
for that, I guess.

00:19:41.203 --> 00:19:43.580
[TAKEDA] That's the
beer talking, isn't it?

00:19:46.166 --> 00:19:47.959
We might'a drank too much.

00:19:48.043 --> 00:19:49.920
Yeah, we did.

00:19:50.003 --> 00:19:51.630
[TAKEDA]
We were out for a while.

00:19:51.713 --> 00:19:53.674
The trains are about
to stop running.

00:19:53.757 --> 00:19:55.634
Sorry to keep you out so late.

00:19:55.717 --> 00:19:57.135
[FUTABA]
Good, you should be!

00:19:57.219 --> 00:20:00.013
I can't believe you'd keep
a lady out this late at night.

00:20:00.097 --> 00:20:01.556
[laughs]

00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:04.559
Ah, sue me, you're fun
to go drinking with!

00:20:07.145 --> 00:20:11.233
Takeda, I went to visit a client
all by myself this afternoon.

00:20:11.316 --> 00:20:12.818
You did?

00:20:12.901 --> 00:20:16.196
I gave a whole presentation, and
wound up going to lunch alone.

00:20:16.279 --> 00:20:17.739
Uh-huh?

00:20:17.823 --> 00:20:22.077
Pretty soon, I'm gonna be
a full-fledged salesperson.

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:27.499
So, y'know, you can't expect me
to always be by your side, okay?

00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:32.295
[TAKEDA]
Hey, listen.

00:20:32.379 --> 00:20:33.797
What?

00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:36.466
Not to get all
serious or anything.

00:20:36.550 --> 00:20:38.010
But I just wanna say,

00:20:38.093 --> 00:20:41.346
I don't know who'll be
with you later down the road,

00:20:41.430 --> 00:20:43.932
but I'll be by your side
until you find them.

00:20:44.016 --> 00:20:45.726
Okay?

00:20:49.730 --> 00:20:52.316
That's the beer talking,
isn't it?

00:20:52.399 --> 00:20:55.319
Yeah. Maybe a little.

00:20:56.361 --> 00:20:58.739
Well, thanks for saying that.

00:20:58.822 --> 00:21:01.491
Just make sure you
protect me until then, 'kay?

00:22:40.674 --> 00:22:42.968
[FUTABA]
It's really coming down.

00:22:45.595 --> 00:22:46.471
What's the matter?

00:22:46.555 --> 00:22:47.931
[FUTABA]
I forgot my umbrella.

00:22:48.015 --> 00:22:49.933
Oh.

00:22:50.017 --> 00:22:51.435
Do you wanna share mine, then?

00:22:51.518 --> 00:22:53.478
What? But I... I couldn't.

00:22:53.562 --> 00:22:55.439
Come on, don't be shy.

00:23:02.446 --> 00:23:05.490
[FUTABA] Sharing an umbrella,
I can't believe this.

00:23:08.201 --> 00:23:10.829
Tell ya what, why don't I just
buy myself a new umbrella?

00:23:10.912 --> 00:23:12.331
Where's a convenience store?

00:23:12.414 --> 00:23:14.541
Nah, you don't have to
waste your money like that.

00:23:14.624 --> 00:23:16.209
Mine is big enough
for both of us.

00:23:16.293 --> 00:23:17.252
[FUTABA]
Y-Yeah, but--

00:23:17.336 --> 00:23:18.837
You're getting wet.

00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:20.464
Scoot on in here.

00:23:24.259 --> 00:23:26.678
Nope! Nope! No!

00:23:33.477 --> 00:23:35.354
[FUTABA]
You know something?

00:23:35.437 --> 00:23:38.148
You really are annoying.
