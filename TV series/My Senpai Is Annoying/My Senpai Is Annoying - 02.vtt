00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.059 align:middle
[EMPLOYEE A]
Good morning.

00:00:18.143 --> 00:00:19.561 align:middle
Morning.

00:00:22.188 --> 00:00:23.273 align:middle
[HIJIKATA]
She's freaking out.

00:00:23.356 --> 00:00:24.858 align:middle
She must've woken up in a mood.

00:00:24.941 --> 00:00:27.152 align:middle
[OOISHI]
Yeah, every day of her life.

00:00:31.156 --> 00:00:32.866 align:middle
[FUTABA]
What should I do?

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:36.661 align:middle
I drank too much last night and
said something I didn't mean.

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.875 align:middle
I don't get it.

00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:44.544 align:middle
Why couldn't I be your wife?

00:00:45.587 --> 00:00:46.880 align:middle
[gasps]

00:00:48.923 --> 00:00:50.258 align:middle
[FUTABA]
What the heck am I saying?

00:00:50.342 --> 00:00:53.053 align:middle
Oh no, how do I fix this?

00:00:53.136 --> 00:00:56.431 align:middle
What should I do?
What should I do?

00:00:58.558 --> 00:01:00.477 align:middle
Hey, you all right?

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.187 align:middle
[FUTABA]
I feel sick.

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.899 align:middle
No way! Do not puke here!

00:01:05.982 --> 00:01:06.900 align:middle
[FUTABA]
It's coming!

00:01:06.983 --> 00:01:08.610 align:middle
I'm gonna throw up!

00:01:08.693 --> 00:01:10.820 align:middle
[TAKEDA] Hold it in!
We're almost there!

00:01:12.614 --> 00:01:15.617 align:middle
I wish I could forget that.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.245 align:middle
I mean, in no universe do
I want to be Takeda's wife!

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:21.748 align:middle
I've got to find
a way to take it back.

00:01:22.207 --> 00:01:25.543 align:middle
[SAKURAI]
Takeda! Good morning to you.

00:01:25.627 --> 00:01:27.420 align:middle
Morning, Sakurai!

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:35.845 align:middle
Yo, Igarashi!

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:38.848 align:middle
Oh. Uh. Greetings!

00:01:38.932 --> 00:01:40.475 align:middle
How are you?

00:01:40.558 --> 00:01:42.602 align:middle
Huh?

00:01:42.686 --> 00:01:43.978 align:middle
[laughs]

00:01:44.062 --> 00:01:45.230 align:middle
Pretty simple question.

00:01:45.313 --> 00:01:46.523 align:middle
How are you?

00:01:46.606 --> 00:01:48.817 align:middle
Fine, I guess.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.111 align:middle
Uh-oh, what's wrong?

00:01:51.194 --> 00:01:54.197 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Nothing! Not a single thing!

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.241 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Hmm?

00:01:56.324 --> 00:01:58.034 align:middle
[FUTABA]
I can't do this here!

00:01:58.118 --> 00:02:00.203 align:middle
I'll have to try again at lunch!

00:03:40.595 --> 00:03:43.348 align:middle
Hey, Takeda, would you
care to join me for lunch?

00:03:43.431 --> 00:03:45.517 align:middle
That sounds good!

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:46.935 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Darn!

00:03:47.018 --> 00:03:48.228 align:middle
Excuse me!

00:03:48.311 --> 00:03:49.437 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Hmm?

00:03:49.521 --> 00:03:52.023 align:middle
Ah. Oh, never mind.

00:03:52.107 --> 00:03:53.942 align:middle
Nothing.

00:03:54.025 --> 00:03:56.653 align:middle
[CHIEF chuckles]
Oh, that's right!

00:03:56.736 --> 00:03:57.946 align:middle
Huh?

00:03:58.029 --> 00:04:00.907 align:middle
I forgot, I have an urgent
matter to attend to.

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:02.617 align:middle
Sorry about that, Takeda.

00:04:02.701 --> 00:04:05.286 align:middle
We'll have lunch next time.

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.372 align:middle
Igarashi! Wanna go grab a bite?

00:04:07.455 --> 00:04:09.499 align:middle
Oh, sure.

00:04:09.582 --> 00:04:11.543 align:middle
[TAKEDA laughs]

00:04:11.626 --> 00:04:12.961 align:middle
You mean to tell me
you're still upset

00:04:13.044 --> 00:04:15.922 align:middle
about what happened last night?

00:04:16.006 --> 00:04:18.008 align:middle
Well, that explains it.

00:04:18.091 --> 00:04:19.801 align:middle
You've looked
miserable all morning!

00:04:19.884 --> 00:04:22.679 align:middle
[laughs]

00:04:22.762 --> 00:04:24.139 align:middle
You laugh too much!

00:04:24.222 --> 00:04:25.348 align:middle
And it's super annoying!

00:04:25.432 --> 00:04:26.933 align:middle
Stop!

00:04:27.017 --> 00:04:29.310 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Sorry, sorry.

00:04:30.395 --> 00:04:31.896 align:middle
Well, don't worry about it.

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:33.648 align:middle
Huh?

00:04:33.732 --> 00:04:36.693 align:middle
'Cause I knew good and well
it was all the beer talking.

00:04:36.776 --> 00:04:38.695 align:middle
Looking after a
drunken co-worker,

00:04:38.778 --> 00:04:41.531 align:middle
that's just part
of a supervisor's job.

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:48.038 align:middle
Sorry to have caused
you so much trouble.

00:04:48.121 --> 00:04:49.539 align:middle
No worries, for real.

00:04:49.622 --> 00:04:51.708 align:middle
Now eat your noodles.

00:04:51.791 --> 00:04:53.293 align:middle
[FUTABA]
I'm confused.

00:04:53.376 --> 00:04:55.795 align:middle
Is this a good thing?

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:58.256 align:middle
It's so hard to tell.

00:05:03.094 --> 00:05:05.180 align:middle
[HIJIKATA]
Oh, heavenly angel!

00:05:06.556 --> 00:05:08.850 align:middle
[HIJIKATA]
Oh, divine goddess!

00:05:08.933 --> 00:05:10.810 align:middle
Fate has brought
our paths together!

00:05:10.894 --> 00:05:13.646 align:middle
I simply must go speak
with them this very moment!

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:16.608 align:middle
That's cool, but maybe
eat your ramen first.

00:05:18.026 --> 00:05:19.361 align:middle
Oh! Just look!

00:05:19.444 --> 00:05:21.488 align:middle
That totally perfect figure!

00:05:21.571 --> 00:05:23.239 align:middle
Her luxurious, silky hair!

00:05:23.323 --> 00:05:25.533 align:middle
The entire way she
carries herself around!

00:05:25.617 --> 00:05:27.619 align:middle
She's extraordinary!

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:32.874 align:middle
[HIJIKATA]
Beautiful Sakurai!

00:05:32.957 --> 00:05:36.461 align:middle
Outside the office, her
classiness is even more obvious!

00:05:36.544 --> 00:05:39.297 align:middle
No wonder she's the most
popular girl in the office.

00:05:39.381 --> 00:05:41.383 align:middle
Yes, and she's got that smile.

00:05:41.466 --> 00:05:42.509 align:middle
Every time I ask her out,

00:05:42.592 --> 00:05:44.177 align:middle
she always politely declines

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.347 align:middle
with that unmistakable,
heart-smashing smile of hers.

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.474 align:middle
Well, you're not the only one.

00:05:49.557 --> 00:05:51.017 align:middle
What? Hold on.

00:05:51.101 --> 00:05:54.854 align:middle
Are you telling that me you've
asked her out too, Kazama?

00:05:54.938 --> 00:05:56.231 align:middle
Yeah, right.

00:05:56.314 --> 00:05:57.857 align:middle
She's obviously
way out of our league.

00:05:57.941 --> 00:05:59.776 align:middle
None of us stand a chance.

00:05:59.859 --> 00:06:02.195 align:middle
[HIJIKATA] Well,
I for one am not giving up!

00:06:02.278 --> 00:06:03.488 align:middle
Since she turned me
down for drinks,

00:06:03.571 --> 00:06:06.366 align:middle
I'm going to ask her out
for dinner instead.

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:09.160 align:middle
[OOISHI] None of the other guys
have even gotten that far.

00:06:09.244 --> 00:06:10.787 align:middle
I wonder what kind of
man you'd have to be

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:13.456 align:middle
for her to be
willing to say "yes."

00:06:17.335 --> 00:06:19.004 align:middle
[STAFF B]
Thanks for your business!

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:26.469 align:middle
Hey. Look who it is.

00:06:26.553 --> 00:06:28.888 align:middle
[KAZAMA]
Hello, Takeda. Igarashi.

00:06:28.972 --> 00:06:33.184 align:middle
Right, lemme think.

00:06:33.268 --> 00:06:34.978 align:middle
Oh! Hi, Koishi.

00:06:35.061 --> 00:06:36.688 align:middle
Ooishi, actually.

00:06:36.771 --> 00:06:38.023 align:middle
You two have lunch together?

00:06:38.106 --> 00:06:39.399 align:middle
As usual?

00:06:39.482 --> 00:06:41.901 align:middle
Yeah. Hit a soba shop today.

00:06:41.985 --> 00:06:44.696 align:middle
[OOISHI]
You guys really are close, huh?

00:06:44.779 --> 00:06:46.573 align:middle
Don't ask rude
questions, Koishi.

00:06:46.656 --> 00:06:48.116 align:middle
Come on, it's Ooishi.

00:06:48.199 --> 00:06:50.452 align:middle
Listen! There's nothing going
on between Takeda and me

00:06:50.535 --> 00:06:53.204 align:middle
that doesn't go on
between any two coworkers!

00:06:53.288 --> 00:06:54.664 align:middle
Yeah, come to think.

00:06:54.748 --> 00:06:58.084 align:middle
Whenever I see the
two of you side by side,

00:06:58.168 --> 00:07:00.045 align:middle
you look more like
father and daughter!

00:07:00.128 --> 00:07:02.589 align:middle
[KAZAMA]
Hey! If we don't get a move on,

00:07:02.672 --> 00:07:04.507 align:middle
we won't have time
to grab coffee.

00:07:04.591 --> 00:07:06.634 align:middle
Yeah, good call.

00:07:06.718 --> 00:07:08.011 align:middle
See you back at the office!

00:07:08.094 --> 00:07:09.971 align:middle
Sure!

00:07:10.055 --> 00:07:13.350 align:middle
Guess those three
are pretty close, huh?

00:07:13.433 --> 00:07:14.184 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Takeda.

00:07:14.267 --> 00:07:15.352 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Hmm?

00:07:15.435 --> 00:07:16.853 align:middle
Is that true?

00:07:16.936 --> 00:07:19.773 align:middle
Do others really look at me
and think I'm your daughter?

00:07:22.442 --> 00:07:24.444 align:middle
Come on, who cares
what they think?

00:07:24.527 --> 00:07:26.613 align:middle
Let's kick some
butt this afternoon!

00:07:26.696 --> 00:07:27.530 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Would you quit?

00:07:27.614 --> 00:07:29.157 align:middle
That's why people wonder!

00:07:30.408 --> 00:07:31.493 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Honestly.

00:07:31.576 --> 00:07:33.620 align:middle
He's right, it doesn't matter.

00:07:33.703 --> 00:07:38.958 align:middle
And this has got nothing
to do with work, but...

00:07:39.042 --> 00:07:40.377 align:middle
Maybe...

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:44.631 align:middle
Takeda doesn't see me as
a real woman and never has.

00:07:50.595 --> 00:07:53.139 align:middle
[FUTABA] So, Sakurai,
you've got big ones, right?

00:07:53.223 --> 00:07:54.933 align:middle
[SAKURAI]
Hmm?

00:07:55.016 --> 00:07:56.142 align:middle
Tell me.

00:07:56.226 --> 00:07:57.560 align:middle
Is there some trick
to making them bigger?

00:07:57.644 --> 00:07:59.062 align:middle
If so, gimme the scoop.

00:07:59.145 --> 00:08:01.398 align:middle
Wait, what kind of trick
are you talking about?

00:08:08.071 --> 00:08:09.906 align:middle
Listen, Futaba,
I think you're the cutest

00:08:09.989 --> 00:08:11.032 align:middle
just the way you are.

00:08:11.116 --> 00:08:12.701 align:middle
Don't do that! Shut up!

00:08:12.784 --> 00:08:15.704 align:middle
You big-breasted women
will just never understand!

00:08:16.413 --> 00:08:19.082 align:middle
[GIRL A] Last night's homework
was so freaking hard.

00:08:19.165 --> 00:08:20.917 align:middle
[GIRL B]
Yeah, you're not kidding!

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:31.845 align:middle
It's so unfair!

00:08:31.928 --> 00:08:33.930 align:middle
And it's been the
same way my entire life!

00:08:34.014 --> 00:08:36.474 align:middle
The haves can't grasp
the pain of the have-nots!

00:08:36.558 --> 00:08:38.643 align:middle
Uh... Right.

00:08:38.727 --> 00:08:40.311 align:middle
Just so you know,
having bigger ones

00:08:40.395 --> 00:08:42.981 align:middle
comes with its
own set of problems.

00:08:43.064 --> 00:08:45.108 align:middle
Besides, I don't think
Takeda cares about

00:08:45.191 --> 00:08:47.068 align:middle
that sort of thing, anyway.

00:08:47.152 --> 00:08:48.570 align:middle
[sighs]

00:08:48.653 --> 00:08:51.114 align:middle
But is it too much to ask
to be at least average-sized?

00:08:51.197 --> 00:08:52.699 align:middle
[gasps]

00:08:52.782 --> 00:08:55.368 align:middle
Hold on, what the heck made you
bring up Takeda all of a sudden?

00:08:55.452 --> 00:08:59.080 align:middle
[laughs]

00:08:59.164 --> 00:09:01.541 align:middle
That man's got
nothing to do with this!

00:09:01.624 --> 00:09:04.836 align:middle
[SAKURAI] Nuh-uh.
No, of course he doesn't.

00:09:04.919 --> 00:09:07.339 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Enough already!

00:09:13.178 --> 00:09:15.597 align:middle
Takeda, I'm gonna
take off for the day.

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:17.807 align:middle
Oh. Looks like
you're in a hurry.

00:09:17.891 --> 00:09:19.392 align:middle
You got some stuff to do?

00:09:19.476 --> 00:09:21.102 align:middle
[FUTABA] Well, yeah,
I'm supposed to go shopping

00:09:21.186 --> 00:09:22.395 align:middle
with a friend after work.

00:09:22.479 --> 00:09:24.814 align:middle
I see. Be careful, yeah?

00:09:24.898 --> 00:09:26.107 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Will do.

00:09:28.985 --> 00:09:30.320 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Don't get lost or anything.

00:09:30.403 --> 00:09:33.073 align:middle
Stop that!
I'm not a little kid, you know!

00:09:36.242 --> 00:09:37.744 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Honestly.

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:42.707 align:middle
[MAN A]
Hey, Gorgeous. You free?

00:09:44.125 --> 00:09:47.587 align:middle
S'cuse me? Hello? Gorgeous?

00:09:47.671 --> 00:09:49.130 align:middle
Wanna get a bite to...

00:09:49.214 --> 00:09:51.466 align:middle
Hey, you listening to me?

00:09:51.549 --> 00:09:52.384 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Natsumi!

00:09:52.467 --> 00:09:53.885 align:middle
[NATSUMI]
Hm?

00:09:53.968 --> 00:09:56.262 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Sorry to keep you waiting!

00:09:56.346 --> 00:09:58.640 align:middle
Thanks so much
for coming out this far.

00:09:58.723 --> 00:10:00.058 align:middle
I got some good running in.

00:10:00.141 --> 00:10:01.142 align:middle
No worries.

00:10:01.226 --> 00:10:02.936 align:middle
Pardon, uh...

00:10:08.191 --> 00:10:09.442 align:middle
Think he's okay?

00:10:09.526 --> 00:10:11.778 align:middle
Oh, he'll be just fine.

00:10:11.861 --> 00:10:14.114 align:middle
Let's pop by the arcade
before we shop.

00:10:14.197 --> 00:10:15.490 align:middle
Yeah.

00:10:23.331 --> 00:10:26.292 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Big breasts strike again. Great.

00:10:36.219 --> 00:10:38.430 align:middle
Ohoo...!

00:10:46.146 --> 00:10:47.814 align:middle
Ahhh...!

00:10:48.898 --> 00:10:52.068 align:middle
[FUTABA] Natsumi, you sure
haven't lost your touch!

00:10:52.152 --> 00:10:53.945 align:middle
Guess not.

00:10:54.029 --> 00:10:55.071 align:middle
[CLERK]
Hi there, ladies!

00:10:55.155 --> 00:10:56.448 align:middle
We're doing a promotion!

00:10:56.531 --> 00:10:58.408 align:middle
Take one!

00:10:58.491 --> 00:11:00.076 align:middle
It's a soft little bear bun toy!

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:02.287 align:middle
Please, take one, both of you!

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:04.039 align:middle
We're giving them away!

00:11:04.122 --> 00:11:06.416 align:middle
Come on, help yourself!

00:11:06.499 --> 00:11:08.752 align:middle
They must be getting
rid of their stock.

00:11:10.086 --> 00:11:11.755 align:middle
[NATSUMI]
No thank you.

00:11:11.838 --> 00:11:13.465 align:middle
[FUTABA ooos]

00:11:16.092 --> 00:11:17.218 align:middle
[FUTABA]
I'll take two!

00:11:17.302 --> 00:11:20.597 align:middle
Great! Thanks so
much for coming by!

00:11:23.266 --> 00:11:25.685 align:middle
You really do get into
that kind of stuff, don't you?

00:11:25.769 --> 00:11:27.896 align:middle
Well, yeah, they're cute.

00:11:31.941 --> 00:11:34.486 align:middle
Uh, hey, Natsumi?

00:11:34.569 --> 00:11:37.489 align:middle
There were some outfits
that actually caught my eye.

00:11:37.572 --> 00:11:39.532 align:middle
Do you mind if I go try them on?

00:11:39.616 --> 00:11:41.868 align:middle
Not at all. I'll be here.

00:11:58.009 --> 00:12:00.387 align:middle
Look at that,
with these in there,

00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:02.514 align:middle
I'm surprisingly ladylike!

00:12:02.597 --> 00:12:06.351 align:middle
I mean, wow, nice boobs!

00:12:06.434 --> 00:12:07.185 align:middle
You done yet?

00:12:07.268 --> 00:12:08.186 align:middle
Or is there more?

00:12:08.269 --> 00:12:09.396 align:middle
[gasps]

00:12:11.523 --> 00:12:14.234 align:middle
[NATSUMI]
Aww, how cute are you?

00:12:15.735 --> 00:12:17.779 align:middle
Futaba, you are just adorable.

00:12:17.862 --> 00:12:20.573 align:middle
I'd love some more pics
of you being cute.

00:12:21.658 --> 00:12:22.867 align:middle
[FUTABA groans]

00:12:26.413 --> 00:12:28.206 align:middle
Oh man, what a haul!

00:12:28.289 --> 00:12:30.166 align:middle
You should wear
those all the way home.

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:32.085 align:middle
Kill me now and
put me out of my misery!

00:12:32.168 --> 00:12:33.712 align:middle
Please, I'm begging you!

00:12:35.714 --> 00:12:38.675 align:middle
So, Futaba, you seeing
anyone right now?

00:12:38.758 --> 00:12:39.718 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Hmm?

00:12:39.801 --> 00:12:40.552 align:middle
What?

00:12:40.635 --> 00:12:42.387 align:middle
Why... Why do you ask?

00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:43.513 align:middle
Thought you might be.

00:12:43.596 --> 00:12:44.764 align:middle
Well, I'm not, okay?

00:12:44.848 --> 00:12:46.725 align:middle
I'm not dating anyone
because my career

00:12:46.808 --> 00:12:48.977 align:middle
happens to be everything
to me right now!

00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:52.230 align:middle
Is there anyone at work
you can't stop thinking about?

00:12:54.399 --> 00:12:56.735 align:middle
I'm telling you,
there's not, 'kay?

00:12:56.818 --> 00:12:58.653 align:middle
[NATSUMI]
Mm-hmm.

00:12:59.487 --> 00:13:00.905 align:middle
All right, see you later!

00:13:00.989 --> 00:13:03.241 align:middle
Next time I want to hear all
about that special someone.

00:13:03.324 --> 00:13:06.161 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Relentless! You are relentless!

00:13:14.377 --> 00:13:16.171 align:middle
[FUTABA] Darn!
I should have taken them out

00:13:16.254 --> 00:13:20.300 align:middle
after I said goodbye
to her at the station.

00:13:20.383 --> 00:13:24.971 align:middle
But as long as nobody I know
sees me like this, I guess...

00:13:25.055 --> 00:13:26.389 align:middle
[ANNOUNCER]
Please watch your step.

00:13:26.473 --> 00:13:28.975 align:middle
The doors on the
right side will now open.

00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:34.939 align:middle
[TAKEDA] Yeah, that last
dunk was pretty awesome!

00:13:36.983 --> 00:13:38.693 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Wh-Wh-Why, of all people,

00:13:38.777 --> 00:13:41.446 align:middle
does it have to be these two?

00:13:41.529 --> 00:13:43.782 align:middle
[ANNOUNCER] The train sways
as we pass over a curve.

00:13:43.865 --> 00:13:45.158 align:middle
Please be careful.

00:13:45.241 --> 00:13:46.910 align:middle
[FUTABA] I'll just stay
like this until they leave.

00:13:46.993 --> 00:13:48.620 align:middle
Maybe they won't spot me.

00:13:51.748 --> 00:13:52.540 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Hmm?

00:13:52.624 --> 00:13:54.209 align:middle
You all right, miss?

00:13:54.292 --> 00:13:56.252 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Fine, thanks.

00:13:56.336 --> 00:13:59.047 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Hey. Igarashi, is that you?

00:14:01.174 --> 00:14:02.467 align:middle
Wait, I remember now.

00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:04.761 align:middle
You said you were going
shopping with a friend.

00:14:04.844 --> 00:14:08.181 align:middle
Right, well, yeah, I did.

00:14:09.933 --> 00:14:12.644 align:middle
So? Whadja buy yourself?

00:14:12.727 --> 00:14:15.563 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Some clothes and stuff.

00:14:15.647 --> 00:14:17.357 align:middle
What have you guys been up to?

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:20.860 align:middle
[TAKEDA] We went to see Kazama's
supervisor play basketball.

00:14:20.944 --> 00:14:22.862 align:middle
Want to come with us next time?

00:14:22.946 --> 00:14:26.199 align:middle
Oh, thanks, but I don't know
all that much about sports.

00:14:28.076 --> 00:14:30.328 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Okay, well, this is our stop.

00:14:30.412 --> 00:14:31.329 align:middle
See ya' later!

00:14:31.413 --> 00:14:32.664 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Uh, yep!

00:14:38.169 --> 00:14:38.962 align:middle
[KAZAMA]
Takeda.

00:14:39.045 --> 00:14:40.422 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Hmm?

00:14:40.505 --> 00:14:41.589 align:middle
[KAZAMA] Did you
notice anything different

00:14:41.673 --> 00:14:43.675 align:middle
about Igarashi just now?

00:14:43.758 --> 00:14:47.554 align:middle
Uh... No, not particularly.

00:14:47.637 --> 00:14:49.931 align:middle
[KAZAMA]
You're kidding, right?

00:14:50.015 --> 00:14:51.558 align:middle
[FUTABA]
He didn't laugh,

00:14:51.641 --> 00:14:55.478 align:middle
but only because he didn't
notice them in the first place.

00:14:55.562 --> 00:14:59.691 align:middle
Well, then,
I guess this proves it.

00:14:59.774 --> 00:15:01.568 align:middle
I'm not just being paranoid.

00:15:01.651 --> 00:15:04.904 align:middle
Takeda really doesn't
see me as a woman at all.

00:15:10.744 --> 00:15:12.412 align:middle
[GRANDPA humming]

00:15:12.495 --> 00:15:13.371 align:middle
I forgot the words.

00:15:13.455 --> 00:15:15.915 align:middle
[phone ringing]

00:15:15.999 --> 00:15:17.542 align:middle
[GRANDPA]
Hmm?

00:15:21.004 --> 00:15:22.964 align:middle
[GRANDPA]
Futaba's calling!

00:15:23.048 --> 00:15:24.758 align:middle
Well, hello there! Wow!

00:15:24.841 --> 00:15:27.886 align:middle
It's not every day that I get
a call from you, now, is it?

00:15:27.969 --> 00:15:30.347 align:middle
Uh. Hi, Grandpa.

00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:31.890 align:middle
[GRANDPA]
Oh no, what's wrong, Futaba?

00:15:31.973 --> 00:15:33.141 align:middle
Why are you crying?

00:15:34.559 --> 00:15:37.520 align:middle
There's something I really
need to ask you, Grandpa.

00:15:37.604 --> 00:15:39.230 align:middle
[GRANDPA]
Ask away! Anything!

00:15:39.314 --> 00:15:41.024 align:middle
What is it? Go on!

00:15:41.107 --> 00:15:43.693 align:middle
What would you think if,
if one day my breasts

00:15:43.777 --> 00:15:47.072 align:middle
were to randomly get a
lot bigger all of a sudden?

00:15:48.406 --> 00:15:50.700 align:middle
[GRANDPA] Wait,
what are you talking about?

00:15:50.784 --> 00:15:52.952 align:middle
Well, it's just that a lot
of stuff happened today,

00:15:53.036 --> 00:15:56.039 align:middle
and my breasts were temporarily
bigger for a little while.

00:15:56.122 --> 00:15:57.248 align:middle
[GRANDPA]
Hmm?

00:15:57.332 --> 00:16:00.293 align:middle
But my friend didn't
even notice at all.

00:16:00.377 --> 00:16:03.546 align:middle
What do you think
that means, Grandpa?

00:16:05.215 --> 00:16:07.467 align:middle
[GRANDPA] My darling
granddaughter, who rarely calls,

00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:09.386 align:middle
is asking me for advice!

00:16:09.469 --> 00:16:12.764 align:middle
I've got to give her some
strong words of encouragement.

00:16:12.847 --> 00:16:14.307 align:middle
[clears throat]

00:16:14.391 --> 00:16:17.519 align:middle
Futaba, your appeal consists
of more than just your breasts.

00:16:17.602 --> 00:16:20.522 align:middle
I'm willing to bet that your
friend is already so dazzled

00:16:20.605 --> 00:16:23.233 align:middle
by you that he doesn't care
one little bit how small your--

00:16:23.316 --> 00:16:24.776 align:middle
[phone click]

00:16:24.859 --> 00:16:26.486 align:middle
Futaba?

00:16:26.569 --> 00:16:30.865 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Darn. The stupid battery's dead.

00:16:30.949 --> 00:16:33.076 align:middle
[groans]

00:16:34.953 --> 00:16:36.538 align:middle
[FUTABA grumbles]

00:16:36.621 --> 00:16:39.374 align:middle
I know it's not like
it's Takeda's fault.

00:16:39.457 --> 00:16:41.835 align:middle
So, why am I so upset, then?

00:16:44.629 --> 00:16:47.090 align:middle
[EMPLOYEE E] Wow. I've got
to hand it to you, Sakurai,

00:16:47.173 --> 00:16:48.758 align:middle
these data tables are perfect.

00:16:48.842 --> 00:16:50.135 align:middle
So easy to read!

00:16:50.218 --> 00:16:51.302 align:middle
They're no big deal.

00:16:51.386 --> 00:16:53.555 align:middle
And it's my job
to make them, so...

00:16:53.638 --> 00:16:54.556 align:middle
Hang on, now!

00:16:54.639 --> 00:16:55.932 align:middle
Don't sell yourself short!

00:16:56.016 --> 00:16:58.435 align:middle
I'm glad I asked you
to make them, Sakurai.

00:16:58.518 --> 00:17:00.311 align:middle
I'd love to say thanks.

00:17:00.395 --> 00:17:01.771 align:middle
Will you join me
for drinks tonight?

00:17:01.855 --> 00:17:03.106 align:middle
[SAKURAI]
Hmm?

00:17:03.189 --> 00:17:06.317 align:middle
Oh, sorry, but I have
other plans this evening.

00:17:06.401 --> 00:17:07.610 align:middle
[EMPLOYEE E]
Tomorrow, then?

00:17:07.694 --> 00:17:09.362 align:middle
Tell me which night you're free.

00:17:09.446 --> 00:17:10.655 align:middle
When would it work for you?

00:17:10.739 --> 00:17:11.865 align:middle
Uhh...

00:17:11.948 --> 00:17:13.908 align:middle
[EMPLOYEE D]
Hey, Sakurai?

00:17:13.992 --> 00:17:15.326 align:middle
You've got a phone call!

00:17:15.410 --> 00:17:17.245 align:middle
[SAKURAI]
Be right there!

00:17:17.328 --> 00:17:20.457 align:middle
Well, excuse me, duty calls.

00:17:32.427 --> 00:17:35.138 align:middle
Hi, this is Sakurai.
Thanks for waiting.

00:17:35.889 --> 00:17:37.390 align:middle
[SAKURAI]
Hmm?

00:17:37.474 --> 00:17:39.267 align:middle
Are you there?

00:17:39.351 --> 00:17:43.813 align:middle
[KAZAMA]
Uh, hello. How're you?

00:17:43.897 --> 00:17:45.565 align:middle
Is this Kazama?

00:17:57.577 --> 00:17:59.954 align:middle
[KAZAMA]
Sorry. Wrong number.

00:18:07.796 --> 00:18:10.965 align:middle
[giggles]

00:18:11.049 --> 00:18:13.259 align:middle
What in the...?
What's up with you?

00:18:13.343 --> 00:18:15.470 align:middle
Just a really strange
wrong number call.

00:18:15.553 --> 00:18:17.681 align:middle
Ugh, what a pain.

00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:30.402 align:middle
You can barely reach it.

00:18:30.485 --> 00:18:31.945 align:middle
Would you like a little boost?

00:18:32.028 --> 00:18:33.446 align:middle
Oh, be quiet!

00:18:33.530 --> 00:18:35.782 align:middle
That's no way for you to talk
to a lady like me, mister.

00:18:35.865 --> 00:18:38.118 align:middle
[TAKEDA chuckles]
You meant "girl," right?

00:18:38.201 --> 00:18:39.369 align:middle
[ANNOUNCER]
Please watch your step.

00:18:39.452 --> 00:18:41.663 align:middle
The doors on the
right side will now open.

00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:56.803 align:middle
I don't think so.

00:18:56.886 --> 00:18:58.013 align:middle
[MAN B]
Let go of me!

00:18:58.096 --> 00:18:59.806 align:middle
Excuse me!

00:19:01.558 --> 00:19:03.393 align:middle
I said, let go!

00:19:03.476 --> 00:19:04.602 align:middle
Takeda!

00:19:12.277 --> 00:19:14.195 align:middle
Would you quit trying
to put up a fight?

00:19:16.156 --> 00:19:17.866 align:middle
What do you think you're doing?

00:19:20.535 --> 00:19:24.205 align:middle
Huh? A camera?

00:19:24.289 --> 00:19:25.582 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
That's right.

00:19:25.665 --> 00:19:28.084 align:middle
He took shots up your skirt,
the nasty little creep.

00:19:29.961 --> 00:19:32.047 align:middle
[MAN B]
Please, forgive me.

00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:34.424 align:middle
No way. Impossible.

00:19:39.471 --> 00:19:42.432 align:middle
[FUTABA] Takeda, how come
I never knew you practiced judo?

00:19:42.515 --> 00:19:44.017 align:middle
Yeah, pretty cool, huh?

00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:45.602 align:middle
I'm a red and white belt.

00:19:45.685 --> 00:19:49.189 align:middle
Oh, sorry, I don't know much
about belts and stuff.

00:19:49.272 --> 00:19:50.440 align:middle
Back in the day,

00:19:50.523 --> 00:19:52.692 align:middle
when I was a student,
I trained pretty hard.

00:19:52.776 --> 00:19:54.361 align:middle
Wow.

00:19:54.444 --> 00:19:56.404 align:middle
Hold on, it's okay
for a trained wrestler

00:19:56.488 --> 00:19:58.365 align:middle
to throw a complete novice?

00:19:58.448 --> 00:20:00.325 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Hmm...

00:20:00.408 --> 00:20:02.952 align:middle
Well, no. They might
take my belt away.

00:20:03.036 --> 00:20:05.038 align:middle
[FUTABA gasps]

00:20:05.121 --> 00:20:07.874 align:middle
That would be bad, wouldn't it?

00:20:10.251 --> 00:20:11.711 align:middle
I'd rather lose that

00:20:11.795 --> 00:20:15.048 align:middle
than see one of
my coworkers get really hurt.

00:20:15.131 --> 00:20:17.884 align:middle
Besides, I'm your supervisor!

00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:22.597 align:middle
[TAKEDA sighs]
It's getting late.

00:20:22.681 --> 00:20:23.807 align:middle
I'd better call Chief

00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:26.101 align:middle
and tell him we'll be
going straight home.

00:20:29.771 --> 00:20:32.273 align:middle
Hello, Chief? It's Takeda.

00:20:32.357 --> 00:20:35.318 align:middle
Sorry for not calling
you any sooner than this.

00:20:35.402 --> 00:20:37.320 align:middle
We ran into trouble.

00:20:37.404 --> 00:20:40.699 align:middle
[FUTABA] I guess he may not
see me as a real woman yet,

00:20:40.782 --> 00:20:44.786 align:middle
but... he really
does care about me.

00:20:52.836 --> 00:20:54.254 align:middle
[SAKURAI]
Kazama!

00:20:59.467 --> 00:21:01.678 align:middle
Thanks for that wrong
number call earlier.

00:21:01.761 --> 00:21:03.388 align:middle
[KAZAMA]
Hmm?

00:21:03.471 --> 00:21:06.391 align:middle
I just dialed the wrong number.

00:21:06.474 --> 00:21:09.019 align:middle
[SAKURAI]
Do you have any plans tonight?

00:21:09.102 --> 00:21:12.480 align:middle
[KAZAMA] I was just gonna
go home and do some gaming.

00:21:14.983 --> 00:21:18.069 align:middle
Well, um, would you like
to grab some dinner instead?

00:21:21.322 --> 00:21:24.826 align:middle
Oh! Igarashi's coming, right?

00:21:24.909 --> 00:21:27.078 align:middle
[SAKURAI] Nuh-uh.
Futaba's going straight home

00:21:27.162 --> 00:21:29.456 align:middle
from her client's
office tonight.

00:21:32.417 --> 00:21:34.586 align:middle
[KAZAMA]
Do you happen to like ramen?

00:21:34.669 --> 00:21:37.881 align:middle
Huh? I love it!

00:21:39.466 --> 00:21:41.051 align:middle
[KAZAMA]
All right, let's have ramen.

00:21:41.134 --> 00:21:42.552 align:middle
[SAKURAI]
Mm.

00:21:48.558 --> 00:21:50.769 align:middle
Oh, man, guess we
skipped lunch today, huh?

00:21:50.852 --> 00:21:53.730 align:middle
We sure did,
and I'm about to starve.

00:21:53.813 --> 00:21:55.565 align:middle
There you go!

00:21:55.648 --> 00:21:57.442 align:middle
Yeah! Now we're talkin'!

00:21:59.694 --> 00:22:00.445 align:middle
So...

00:22:00.528 --> 00:22:01.988 align:middle
Huh?

00:22:02.072 --> 00:22:05.575 align:middle
I guess even you can be cool
every once in a while, Takeda.

00:22:05.658 --> 00:22:08.119 align:middle
I definitely respect you
a little bit more now.

00:22:08.203 --> 00:22:10.121 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Hmm?

00:22:10.205 --> 00:22:13.541 align:middle
Listen, I admit you are a woman,
a peculiar type of wo--

00:22:13.625 --> 00:22:16.002 align:middle
[thud]
[TAKEDA groans]

00:22:16.086 --> 00:22:19.673 align:middle
You know, for such a little
lady, you pack quite a punch!

00:22:19.756 --> 00:22:21.758 align:middle
[FUTABA] The "little" part
is uncalled for!
