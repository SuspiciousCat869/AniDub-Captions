00:00:17.642 --> 00:00:19.352 align:middle
[SAKURAI]
Okay, we're here!

00:00:19.436 --> 00:00:20.687 align:middle
[NATSUMI]
The beach!

00:00:22.105 --> 00:00:23.648 align:middle
We're officially
gonna have a blast!

00:00:23.732 --> 00:00:25.316 align:middle
Yeah!

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.360 align:middle
I have something to say!

00:00:27.444 --> 00:00:28.903 align:middle
--What's your prob?
--Gotta pee?

00:00:28.987 --> 00:00:30.697 align:middle
[FUTABA]
No! Seriously.

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:34.409 align:middle
Why are you all here
like it's totally normal?

00:00:34.492 --> 00:00:36.953 align:middle
That's not what
we had talked about.

00:00:37.037 --> 00:00:38.288 align:middle
Hey, Futaba.

00:00:38.371 --> 00:00:39.998 align:middle
Up for a beach trip?

00:00:40.081 --> 00:00:41.583 align:middle
I'm going this weekend.

00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:42.751 align:middle
Oh, the beach?

00:00:42.834 --> 00:00:45.211 align:middle
Yeah, I'm planning
to go with my brother.

00:00:45.295 --> 00:00:46.671 align:middle
Would you like to join?

00:00:46.755 --> 00:00:47.630 align:middle
[FUTABA]
You sure it's cool?

00:00:47.714 --> 00:00:48.882 align:middle
[SAKURAI]
Mm.

00:00:48.965 --> 00:00:50.383 align:middle
The more people we have,
the more fun it'll be,

00:00:50.467 --> 00:00:52.510 align:middle
so please feel free
to invite your friends.

00:00:52.594 --> 00:00:53.553 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Okay!

00:00:53.636 --> 00:00:54.888 align:middle
It was originally supposed to be

00:00:54.971 --> 00:00:57.349 align:middle
just Sakurai,
her brother, and me.

00:00:57.432 --> 00:00:58.767 align:middle
[SAKURAI]
I invited them.

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.311 align:middle
[FUTABA]
You should have told me.

00:01:01.394 --> 00:01:03.480 align:middle
I just thought
I'd try and surprise you.

00:01:03.563 --> 00:01:06.733 align:middle
Well, you definitely
surprised me, there's no doubt.

00:01:06.816 --> 00:01:09.402 align:middle
[TAKEDA] Hey, come on,
don't be such a drag!

00:01:09.486 --> 00:01:11.404 align:middle
We came all the
way out to the beach.

00:01:11.488 --> 00:01:14.449 align:middle
Wouldn't it be way more fun
if all of us hung out together?

00:01:14.532 --> 00:01:16.201 align:middle
You must be Takeda.

00:01:16.284 --> 00:01:19.454 align:middle
I've been close buds with
Futaba ever since junior high.

00:01:19.537 --> 00:01:21.206 align:middle
I'm Natsumi Kurobe.

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:23.416 align:middle
You're Natsumi Kurobe?

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:24.876 align:middle
Well, that's great.

00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:26.294 align:middle
Glad to finally meet!

00:01:26.378 --> 00:01:28.838 align:middle
Oh, believe me, I've been
wanting to meet you, too.

00:01:28.922 --> 00:01:30.840 align:middle
Futaba talks about
you all the time.

00:01:30.924 --> 00:01:32.550 align:middle
Shut up, Natsumi!

00:01:32.634 --> 00:01:33.718 align:middle
Well, come on, ladies.

00:01:33.802 --> 00:01:35.637 align:middle
We should go get changed!

00:03:22.827 --> 00:03:24.621 align:middle
You can set that up right there.

00:03:24.704 --> 00:03:26.081 align:middle
You got it.

00:03:27.624 --> 00:03:29.959 align:middle
Oh, let me help.

00:03:30.043 --> 00:03:31.503 align:middle
[KAZAMA]
Thanks.

00:03:31.586 --> 00:03:33.922 align:middle
[YUTO] Thank you for being
so kind to my sister.

00:03:34.005 --> 00:03:35.340 align:middle
[KAZAMA]
Oh, uh.

00:03:35.423 --> 00:03:36.966 align:middle
It's my pleasure.

00:03:40.303 --> 00:03:41.763 align:middle
They're so alike.

00:03:42.222 --> 00:03:44.015 align:middle
[NATSUMI]
Hey, guys!

00:03:51.231 --> 00:03:54.192 align:middle
Oh! You're quite an eyeful!

00:03:54.275 --> 00:03:56.778 align:middle
Hey, where's Igarashi?

00:03:56.861 --> 00:03:58.738 align:middle
[NATSUMI]
She's right here.

00:04:02.575 --> 00:04:05.412 align:middle
Oh! Look how cute you are!

00:04:05.495 --> 00:04:08.415 align:middle
Ow! Hey! Ouch! Stop!
That hurts! Come on!

00:04:08.498 --> 00:04:10.458 align:middle
Why? What's the deal?

00:04:11.918 --> 00:04:14.629 align:middle
Kazama, you feel
like going for a swim?

00:04:16.798 --> 00:04:18.425 align:middle
[NATSUMI]
You like it?

00:04:22.053 --> 00:04:24.472 align:middle
I've got a pair of those,
too, you know.

00:04:33.106 --> 00:04:37.527 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Hello, ocean!

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:38.403 align:middle
Shall we go?

00:04:38.486 --> 00:04:39.904 align:middle
Yeah!

00:04:40.739 --> 00:04:41.906 align:middle
[GIRL]
Look at the water!

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.743 align:middle
[MOTHER] Hey now,
I said no horsing around!

00:04:44.826 --> 00:04:46.327 align:middle
Wait!

00:04:47.454 --> 00:04:48.705 align:middle
Still in?

00:04:50.874 --> 00:04:53.251 align:middle
Sure, why not?

00:05:05.055 --> 00:05:06.389 align:middle
Here goes!

00:05:11.895 --> 00:05:13.480 align:middle
Hey, are you all right?

00:05:13.563 --> 00:05:15.190 align:middle
Sorry 'bout that!

00:05:15.273 --> 00:05:16.900 align:middle
No, I'm good.

00:05:16.983 --> 00:05:18.943 align:middle
That was one killer serve.

00:05:19.027 --> 00:05:21.404 align:middle
[SAKURAI] I've played
a little volleyball before.

00:05:25.575 --> 00:05:28.536 align:middle
[gasping]

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.997 align:middle
So, uh, hey, Takeda?

00:05:31.081 --> 00:05:33.208 align:middle
We're kind of a long way
from shore, aren't we?

00:05:33.291 --> 00:05:35.752 align:middle
Oh! Yeah, you're right.

00:05:35.835 --> 00:05:37.962 align:middle
Would you stop looking
at me so much?

00:05:38.046 --> 00:05:40.090 align:middle
[laughs]

00:05:40.173 --> 00:05:41.966 align:middle
Well, there's
not much to look at.

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:43.343 align:middle
That hurt!

00:05:43.426 --> 00:05:44.969 align:middle
[FUTABA grumbles]

00:05:45.053 --> 00:05:47.722 align:middle
Pathetic. You men are
all exactly the same.

00:05:47.806 --> 00:05:49.599 align:middle
You just like big boobs.

00:05:49.683 --> 00:05:51.267 align:middle
Of course we do!

00:05:53.269 --> 00:05:55.397 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
You know what, though?

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:58.483 align:middle
I've noticed that you're
a very committed person.

00:05:58.566 --> 00:06:01.903 align:middle
You're always considerate,
and incredibly hard-working,

00:06:01.986 --> 00:06:05.115 align:middle
and consistently kind.

00:06:05.198 --> 00:06:08.118 align:middle
It's those inner qualities
that I like about you.

00:06:08.201 --> 00:06:11.913 align:middle
At the end of the day
that's the important stuff.

00:06:17.168 --> 00:06:20.088 align:middle
Whoa! What are you doing?

00:06:20.171 --> 00:06:24.300 align:middle
Hey! Come on! Hey!
Hey! Knock it off!

00:06:24.384 --> 00:06:26.845 align:middle
What the...? Would you stop?

00:06:27.637 --> 00:06:28.638 align:middle
Ba!

00:06:28.722 --> 00:06:30.015 align:middle
[screams]

00:06:30.098 --> 00:06:32.267 align:middle
Oh god! What's
the matter with you?

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:34.352 align:middle
You know I can't swim!

00:06:34.436 --> 00:06:36.563 align:middle
You are in the water,
so why not practice?

00:06:36.646 --> 00:06:37.605 align:middle
Huh?

00:06:37.689 --> 00:06:39.649 align:middle
Hey, that's a great idea!

00:06:39.733 --> 00:06:43.028 align:middle
Swimming's great.
It feels so free.

00:06:49.701 --> 00:06:51.703 align:middle
I could teach you how.

00:06:52.495 --> 00:06:55.123 align:middle
[FUTABA]
All right. You'd really do that?

00:06:55.206 --> 00:06:56.499 align:middle
[chuckles]

00:06:58.001 --> 00:07:00.170 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Okay, here we go!

00:07:02.297 --> 00:07:03.882 align:middle
Hey! Looking good!

00:07:07.635 --> 00:07:10.388 align:middle
Okay, now stick
your head in the water!

00:07:15.685 --> 00:07:18.063 align:middle
Don't worry, you can do this.

00:07:33.578 --> 00:07:35.830 align:middle
[TAKEDA, NATSUMI]
Ohh!

00:07:35.914 --> 00:07:37.791 align:middle
See, you did great!

00:07:46.007 --> 00:07:46.841 align:middle
[SAKURAI, NATSUMI]
Aw!

00:07:46.925 --> 00:07:48.009 align:middle
Close!

00:07:52.889 --> 00:07:55.892 align:middle
Aw! That was a good try!

00:08:02.232 --> 00:08:04.567 align:middle
I knew something
like that would happen.

00:08:04.651 --> 00:08:07.028 align:middle
There's nothing left to eat.

00:08:11.741 --> 00:08:17.038 align:middle
Ahhh! Look! It's so pretty!

00:08:17.122 --> 00:08:19.290 align:middle
You should take it
as a souvenir.

00:08:19.374 --> 00:08:21.084 align:middle
Yeah, I should.

00:08:21.167 --> 00:08:25.046 align:middle
Hey! It's time
to get going, you two!

00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:26.923 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Oh, okay!

00:08:30.427 --> 00:08:32.137 align:middle
[WHOLE GROUP]
Thank you for having us!

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:34.305 align:middle
Welcome, we've
been expecting you.

00:08:34.389 --> 00:08:35.724 align:middle
Please, do come in.

00:08:35.807 --> 00:08:38.226 align:middle
Man, I'm totally starving!

00:08:38.309 --> 00:08:40.687 align:middle
[PROPRIETRESS] Dinner
will be ready very shortly.

00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:42.105 align:middle
Oh! Wow!

00:08:42.188 --> 00:08:43.565 align:middle
Thanks so much.

00:08:46.109 --> 00:08:47.736 align:middle
[WHOLE GROUP]
Whoa!

00:08:47.819 --> 00:08:49.863 align:middle
[NATSUMI]
This looks good.

00:08:49.946 --> 00:08:50.822 align:middle
[PROPRIETRESS]
Enjoy!

00:08:50.905 --> 00:08:52.907 align:middle
And please, take your time.

00:08:53.867 --> 00:08:55.744 align:middle
[WHOLE GROUP]
Thank you for the food!

00:09:06.254 --> 00:09:07.505 align:middle
That was fast.

00:09:07.589 --> 00:09:09.966 align:middle
Heh. Yeah, you bet it was,
'cause I was starving!

00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:13.303 align:middle
Takeda, can I refill
your bowl for you?

00:09:13.386 --> 00:09:15.055 align:middle
There's a tub of rice over here.

00:09:15.138 --> 00:09:17.349 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Ah! Yeah, thanks.

00:09:17.432 --> 00:09:18.850 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Sure!

00:09:19.684 --> 00:09:21.061 align:middle
[SAKURAI]
Here.

00:09:21.144 --> 00:09:23.063 align:middle
I know they're your favorite.

00:09:23.146 --> 00:09:24.522 align:middle
They're your favorite?

00:09:24.606 --> 00:09:26.775 align:middle
Then, here, have mine, too.

00:09:26.858 --> 00:09:30.236 align:middle
Oh! Thanks, that's
really nice of you!

00:09:32.405 --> 00:09:35.325 align:middle
[NATSUMI]
Look at you, blushing.

00:09:35.408 --> 00:09:38.244 align:middle
Wow! It's so supple.

00:09:38.328 --> 00:09:39.704 align:middle
I know, right?

00:09:39.788 --> 00:09:42.791 align:middle
Yuto's cheeks are
so plump and sweet!

00:09:44.167 --> 00:09:46.336 align:middle
Hey, sis?

00:09:46.419 --> 00:09:48.672 align:middle
I love this. I can't get enough.

00:09:50.965 --> 00:09:51.800 align:middle
Hey!

00:09:51.883 --> 00:09:52.801 align:middle
Cut it out!

00:09:52.884 --> 00:09:55.095 align:middle
Yuto doesn't
like you doing that!

00:09:55.178 --> 00:09:56.638 align:middle
[NATSUMI]
Hmm?

00:09:56.721 --> 00:09:58.848 align:middle
Yuto, hun, do you really hate it

00:09:58.932 --> 00:10:01.101 align:middle
when I touch
your cheeks like this?

00:10:01.184 --> 00:10:05.021 align:middle
Uh, I dunno I, uh--

00:10:05.105 --> 00:10:06.189 align:middle
Natsumi!

00:10:06.272 --> 00:10:08.983 align:middle
Fine, I'm sorry.
I couldn't help it!

00:10:09.067 --> 00:10:10.568 align:middle
So cute.

00:10:10.652 --> 00:10:12.028 align:middle
[KAZAMA]
Here you go.

00:10:13.655 --> 00:10:15.907 align:middle
[YUTO]
Thanks, I appreciate it.

00:10:21.162 --> 00:10:23.957 align:middle
Thanks for serving
it up, Kazama.

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:25.417 align:middle
[KAZAMA]
Sure.

00:10:26.668 --> 00:10:27.794 align:middle
[FUTABA]
The seafood here is excellent

00:10:27.877 --> 00:10:30.338 align:middle
since it's a seaside inn.

00:10:30.422 --> 00:10:31.297 align:middle
This fish is great.

00:10:31.381 --> 00:10:33.758 align:middle
I could eat it forever!

00:10:35.885 --> 00:10:38.638 align:middle
You know, your simmered fish
is excellent, too.

00:10:38.722 --> 00:10:41.307 align:middle
That's right, you're a good
cook, aren't you, Futaba?

00:10:41.391 --> 00:10:42.976 align:middle
Yeah, this is good and all.

00:10:43.059 --> 00:10:44.185 align:middle
Not as good as hers, though.

00:10:44.269 --> 00:10:45.478 align:middle
[gasps]

00:10:45.562 --> 00:10:48.440 align:middle
Wait a minute.
So, you've tried her cooking?

00:10:48.523 --> 00:10:49.399 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Yeah.

00:10:49.482 --> 00:10:53.903 align:middle
Her hamburger steak, her udon...

00:10:53.987 --> 00:10:56.740 align:middle
Yuto, here,
you can have mine, too!

00:10:56.823 --> 00:10:58.366 align:middle
Go on, eat it!

00:10:58.450 --> 00:10:59.743 align:middle
Uh...

00:10:59.826 --> 00:11:01.369 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Oh, here.

00:11:01.453 --> 00:11:03.663 align:middle
You can have mine, too!

00:11:03.747 --> 00:11:05.790 align:middle
Uhh...

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.711 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Man, I'm stuffed!

00:11:09.794 --> 00:11:11.671 align:middle
I feel full and happy!

00:11:13.214 --> 00:11:15.258 align:middle
My stomach.

00:11:15.342 --> 00:11:17.135 align:middle
[SAKURAI] Well, what
should we do after this?

00:11:17.218 --> 00:11:19.220 align:middle
[NATSUMI]
I've got just the thing.

00:11:25.602 --> 00:11:28.146 align:middle
[TAKEDA] I haven't played
with fireworks in years!

00:11:28.229 --> 00:11:29.230 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Oh yeah?

00:11:29.314 --> 00:11:31.232 align:middle
I still do it every year
with my grandpa.

00:11:31.316 --> 00:11:32.692 align:middle
[laughs]

00:11:32.776 --> 00:11:35.862 align:middle
Yeah, he does look like a
guy who likes his fireworks.

00:11:35.945 --> 00:11:38.823 align:middle
[FUTABA] He really loves
launching skyrockets.

00:11:41.785 --> 00:11:42.994 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Ah, here it is!

00:11:43.078 --> 00:11:44.496 align:middle
Let's set this one off next.

00:11:44.579 --> 00:11:45.538 align:middle
[gasps]

00:11:45.622 --> 00:11:47.749 align:middle
That's a great idea!

00:11:47.832 --> 00:11:49.167 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Here goes!

00:11:58.218 --> 00:12:00.428 align:middle
[WHOLE GROUP]
Whooaa...

00:12:07.310 --> 00:12:08.478 align:middle
[SAKURAI]
Huh?

00:12:10.689 --> 00:12:11.940 align:middle
[SAKURAI]
Hmm?

00:12:13.316 --> 00:12:18.571 align:middle
[YUTO, FUTABA screaming]

00:12:18.655 --> 00:12:20.198 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Stop chasing me!

00:12:20.281 --> 00:12:24.119 align:middle
Just go away!

00:12:24.202 --> 00:12:25.578 align:middle
[laughs]

00:12:25.662 --> 00:12:27.997 align:middle
You're such a
scaredy-cat, Igarashi.

00:12:29.416 --> 00:12:31.292 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
See? I put it out.

00:12:43.972 --> 00:12:45.974 align:middle
[gasps]

00:12:46.057 --> 00:12:47.684 align:middle
Why'd you do that?

00:12:47.767 --> 00:12:50.437 align:middle
Here try again.

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:53.023 align:middle
What's the matter?
You look kind of down.

00:12:53.106 --> 00:12:55.025 align:middle
[YUTO]
No, it's nothing.

00:12:55.108 --> 00:12:57.944 align:middle
[NATSUMI]
It's okay. Talk to me.

00:12:58.028 --> 00:13:00.989 align:middle
Well, it's just,
there's this girl at school

00:13:01.072 --> 00:13:02.490 align:middle
who has the same hobby as me.

00:13:02.574 --> 00:13:03.700 align:middle
[NATSUMI]
Mm-hmm.

00:13:03.783 --> 00:13:05.285 align:middle
[YUTO] We decided to
go shopping together

00:13:05.368 --> 00:13:08.538 align:middle
since we both needed the same
things but, unfortunately,

00:13:08.621 --> 00:13:11.291 align:middle
we ran into some other
people from school there.

00:13:11.374 --> 00:13:12.542 align:middle
[NATSUMI]
Mmm?

00:13:12.625 --> 00:13:14.544 align:middle
[YUTO]
They made it so awkward.

00:13:14.627 --> 00:13:16.838 align:middle
I mean, they really
gave us a hard time.

00:13:16.921 --> 00:13:18.381 align:middle
It sucked.

00:13:18.465 --> 00:13:20.133 align:middle
[NATSUMI]
I see.

00:13:20.216 --> 00:13:21.551 align:middle
I don't get it--

00:13:21.634 --> 00:13:24.721 align:middle
is it that weird for a boy
and a girl to be friends?

00:13:24.804 --> 00:13:26.556 align:middle
[NATSUMI]
Mmm...

00:13:26.639 --> 00:13:29.642 align:middle
I don't think so,
but that's just me.

00:13:31.186 --> 00:13:32.979 align:middle
If you enjoy being with them,

00:13:33.063 --> 00:13:35.065 align:middle
then don't let others stop you.

00:13:35.148 --> 00:13:37.901 align:middle
Just remember, you really can't
tell how your relationship

00:13:37.984 --> 00:13:39.527 align:middle
with someone might change.

00:13:39.611 --> 00:13:42.822 align:middle
It depends on so many things.

00:13:42.906 --> 00:13:44.074 align:middle
But who knows?

00:13:44.157 --> 00:13:46.117 align:middle
That person you
thought of as a friend?

00:13:46.201 --> 00:13:49.204 align:middle
They might just turn
into the one you love.

00:13:52.999 --> 00:13:54.584 align:middle
Aw.

00:13:54.668 --> 00:13:58.129 align:middle
Hey! Come on, don't you start
making fun of me too, Kurobe!

00:13:58.213 --> 00:14:01.800 align:middle
[NATSUMI laughs]
Okay, I'm sorry.

00:14:01.883 --> 00:14:04.094 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Well, folks, let's head on back.

00:14:04.177 --> 00:14:05.887 align:middle
[GROUP]
All right.

00:14:08.848 --> 00:14:11.935 align:middle
Whoa, this'll sure test
your courage a little, huh?

00:14:12.018 --> 00:14:14.062 align:middle
You're right, it's pitch black.

00:14:25.031 --> 00:14:27.992 align:middle
[screams]

00:14:28.076 --> 00:14:29.703 align:middle
Oh! Sorry!

00:14:33.665 --> 00:14:35.500 align:middle
Hey, listen, if you're scared...

00:14:35.583 --> 00:14:39.004 align:middle
Here. Go on, take my hand.

00:14:39.087 --> 00:14:40.880 align:middle
What the heck are
you implying, mister?

00:14:40.964 --> 00:14:43.174 align:middle
I'm not a little kid, you know!

00:14:44.009 --> 00:14:44.843 align:middle
[bzzz]

00:14:44.926 --> 00:14:48.471 align:middle
[scrams]

00:14:50.932 --> 00:14:53.476 align:middle
Oh, it's just a cicada.

00:14:54.102 --> 00:14:55.395 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Hmm?

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:02.193 align:middle
[SAKURAI]
Kazama?

00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:09.743 align:middle
[YUTO yawns]

00:15:09.826 --> 00:15:11.453 align:middle
Time to call it a night.

00:15:11.536 --> 00:15:13.747 align:middle
Yeah, I think you're right.

00:15:15.457 --> 00:15:16.416 align:middle
Okay, then.

00:15:16.499 --> 00:15:18.043 align:middle
Sleep well, you guys.

00:15:18.126 --> 00:15:19.169 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Thanks.

00:15:19.252 --> 00:15:20.712 align:middle
Have a good night.

00:15:25.633 --> 00:15:26.885 align:middle
Hey, Futaba.

00:15:26.968 --> 00:15:28.261 align:middle
What is it?

00:15:28.345 --> 00:15:30.722 align:middle
How're things going lately
with you and Takeda?

00:15:30.805 --> 00:15:33.892 align:middle
Huh?! Wait,
what are you talking about?

00:15:33.975 --> 00:15:36.561 align:middle
You two did seem
pretty close today.

00:15:36.644 --> 00:15:38.063 align:middle
What? No, we weren't.

00:15:38.146 --> 00:15:39.731 align:middle
You must be imagining things!

00:15:39.814 --> 00:15:41.858 align:middle
Are they pretty close
at work, too?

00:15:41.941 --> 00:15:43.485 align:middle
[SAKURAI]
Mm. Definitely.

00:15:43.568 --> 00:15:46.821 align:middle
They always go out to make sales
calls and eat lunch together.

00:15:46.905 --> 00:15:48.990 align:middle
Anyone can see
they're super tight.

00:15:49.074 --> 00:15:52.369 align:middle
Ohh... How interesting.

00:15:52.952 --> 00:15:54.704 align:middle
All right,
I'm going to sleep now!

00:15:54.788 --> 00:15:56.331 align:middle
Good night!

00:15:56.414 --> 00:15:57.916 align:middle
Hey! Don't be like that!

00:15:57.999 --> 00:16:00.251 align:middle
[FUTABA grumbles]

00:16:00.335 --> 00:16:03.338 align:middle
Well, you're no fun at all.

00:16:03.421 --> 00:16:05.048 align:middle
Okay, how 'bout you, Sakurai?

00:16:05.131 --> 00:16:06.132 align:middle
Huh?

00:16:06.216 --> 00:16:10.387 align:middle
[snoring]

00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:13.848 align:middle
[YUTO]
No fried shrimp.

00:16:13.932 --> 00:16:15.475 align:middle
I can't eat any more

00:16:15.558 --> 00:16:18.353 align:middle
[NATSUMI] Is there anybody
you like at the office?

00:16:18.436 --> 00:16:20.980 align:middle
[SAKURAI]
Well I mean, I'm not sure.

00:16:21.064 --> 00:16:23.358 align:middle
[giggles]

00:16:23.441 --> 00:16:25.151 align:middle
[KAZAMA]
I can't sleep.

00:16:31.783 --> 00:16:32.659 align:middle
Morning!

00:16:32.742 --> 00:16:34.119 align:middle
How're you, Takeda?

00:16:34.202 --> 00:16:37.372 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Oh, g'morning.

00:16:37.455 --> 00:16:39.749 align:middle
[SAKURAI] It's such a
beautiful day, isn't it?

00:16:39.833 --> 00:16:41.292 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Mm-hmm.

00:16:47.132 --> 00:16:48.883 align:middle
Good Morning, Kazama.

00:16:48.967 --> 00:16:50.301 align:middle
Morning.

00:16:50.385 --> 00:16:53.179 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Dude, you look really sleepy.

00:16:53.263 --> 00:16:54.472 align:middle
Yeah.

00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:56.599 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Really?

00:16:56.683 --> 00:16:57.767 align:middle
That actually happened?

00:16:57.851 --> 00:17:00.020 align:middle
[SAKURAI]
It sure did.

00:17:00.103 --> 00:17:02.272 align:middle
I know those voices.

00:17:02.355 --> 00:17:04.357 align:middle
[KAZAMA]
It's Takeda and Sakurai.

00:17:04.441 --> 00:17:07.527 align:middle
[FUTABA] Huh. That's not
a pairing you see everyday.

00:17:07.610 --> 00:17:10.155 align:middle
But then Kazama
protected me from them,

00:17:10.238 --> 00:17:12.198 align:middle
and I've never been so grateful.

00:17:12.282 --> 00:17:14.409 align:middle
That's somethin' all right!

00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:17.787 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
So, Sakurai,

00:17:17.871 --> 00:17:21.833 align:middle
it seems like you and
Kazama are pretty close.

00:17:21.916 --> 00:17:25.628 align:middle
Ah! You really think so?

00:17:25.712 --> 00:17:27.464 align:middle
Mwah-heh-heh.

00:17:28.882 --> 00:17:31.051 align:middle
Maybe we should be talking
about you and Futaba.

00:17:31.134 --> 00:17:33.803 align:middle
I mean, you two
seem awfully close, too.

00:17:36.556 --> 00:17:38.224 align:middle
Well, duh, of course we are!

00:17:38.308 --> 00:17:42.228 align:middle
Igarashi is my trusty
right-hand-man, after all!

00:17:45.065 --> 00:17:46.441 align:middle
Huh?

00:17:48.777 --> 00:17:49.944 align:middle
[NATSUMI]
Let's just have a blast

00:17:50.028 --> 00:17:51.863 align:middle
until it's time to go home!

00:17:51.946 --> 00:17:53.698 align:middle
[WHOLE GROUP]
Yeah!

00:18:01.039 --> 00:18:02.832 align:middle
[SAKURAI]
Are you glad that's not you?

00:18:02.916 --> 00:18:06.002 align:middle
[KAZAMA] For sure.
I didn't sleep well last night.

00:18:06.086 --> 00:18:07.379 align:middle
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:18:12.092 --> 00:18:15.095 align:middle
Come on. Let's go get a drink.

00:18:17.639 --> 00:18:19.641 align:middle
I'm buying,
so get whatever you want.

00:18:19.724 --> 00:18:21.226 align:middle
[SAKURAI]
Oh, thanks!

00:18:21.309 --> 00:18:23.103 align:middle
I'll pay you back later.

00:18:23.978 --> 00:18:27.357 align:middle
[SAKURAI]
I think I want a frozen treat.

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:31.152 align:middle
Which one should I get?

00:18:31.236 --> 00:18:32.404 align:middle
Huh?

00:18:38.410 --> 00:18:40.036 align:middle
Huh?

00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:41.788 align:middle
[KAZAMA] Wow, those
sure bring back memories.

00:18:41.871 --> 00:18:43.415 align:middle
[SAKURAI]
Hmm?

00:18:43.498 --> 00:18:45.500 align:middle
Oh, you want some, too?

00:18:45.583 --> 00:18:48.003 align:middle
Yeah, I actually do.

00:18:51.214 --> 00:18:53.675 align:middle
Here. All yours.

00:18:53.758 --> 00:18:55.385 align:middle
Uh.

00:18:56.720 --> 00:19:00.807 align:middle
Well, second thought,
that's okay.

00:19:00.890 --> 00:19:04.102 align:middle
[laughs]

00:19:04.185 --> 00:19:05.937 align:middle
Sorry 'bout that!

00:19:08.273 --> 00:19:10.108 align:middle
Here you go, Kazama.

00:19:10.191 --> 00:19:12.402 align:middle
You can have the other one.

00:19:27.375 --> 00:19:29.627 align:middle
Guess they finally
wore themselves out.

00:19:29.711 --> 00:19:31.087 align:middle
[KAZAMA]
Apparently.

00:19:33.131 --> 00:19:36.760 align:middle
[SAKURAI] They're both sleeping
so deeply, like little children.

00:19:39.054 --> 00:19:40.347 align:middle
[NATSUMI]
I'm glad.

00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:41.222 align:middle
[SAKURAI]
Hmm?

00:19:41.306 --> 00:19:43.099 align:middle
Glad her work friends are nice.

00:19:43.183 --> 00:19:44.893 align:middle
Every one of you.

00:19:45.393 --> 00:19:46.853 align:middle
Thanks, Natsumi.

00:19:48.063 --> 00:19:50.690 align:middle
It makes me happy when
Futaba's enjoying herself.

00:19:50.774 --> 00:19:53.401 align:middle
I totally get it, so let's
hang out again sometime.

00:19:53.485 --> 00:19:55.653 align:middle
Sure thing! And Yuto, too.

00:19:55.737 --> 00:19:58.156 align:middle
Oh cool!

00:20:08.667 --> 00:20:11.127 align:middle
Guess they finally
wore themselves out.

00:20:11.211 --> 00:20:13.088 align:middle
It looks that way.

00:20:13.171 --> 00:20:14.964 align:middle
We really whooped it up, huh?

00:20:15.048 --> 00:20:16.841 align:middle
Uh-huh.

00:20:19.427 --> 00:20:20.970 align:middle
[FUTABA]
You were right, you know.

00:20:21.054 --> 00:20:22.222 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Hmm?

00:20:22.305 --> 00:20:24.766 align:middle
All of us hanging together
was way more fun.

00:20:24.849 --> 00:20:26.267 align:middle
Yeah.

00:20:28.186 --> 00:20:30.313 align:middle
I guess summer's almost over.

00:20:40.031 --> 00:20:42.075 align:middle
[FUTABA]
Hey, Takeda?

00:20:43.076 --> 00:20:45.328 align:middle
I was wondering

00:20:45.412 --> 00:20:47.038 align:middle
Yeah, what's up?

00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:50.458 align:middle
Fine, I'm just gonna ask it.

00:20:50.542 --> 00:20:53.336 align:middle
Will you hang out
with me again next summer?

00:20:55.547 --> 00:20:57.465 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Tomorrow's okay, too, you know.

00:20:57.549 --> 00:20:59.718 align:middle
[FUTABA] Very funny.
That's not what I meant!

00:20:59.801 --> 00:21:02.262 align:middle
[TAKEDA laughs]

00:21:05.056 --> 00:21:07.350 align:middle
Good morning, Sakurai.

00:21:07.434 --> 00:21:08.601 align:middle
Morning!

00:21:08.685 --> 00:21:09.853 align:middle
Huh?

00:21:11.521 --> 00:21:12.689 align:middle
What's wrong?

00:21:12.772 --> 00:21:16.026 align:middle
[FUTABA] Oh, it's...
it's nothing, really.

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:32.667 align:middle
Uh. Ah! That's quite
a tan you've got there!

00:21:34.085 --> 00:21:35.295 align:middle
[cries]

00:21:35.378 --> 00:21:36.671 align:middle
That's why I didn't
want you to see!

00:21:36.755 --> 00:21:38.506 align:middle
I look silly!

00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:39.507 align:middle
No, you don't!

00:21:39.591 --> 00:21:41.176 align:middle
It's nothing to worry about.

00:21:41.259 --> 00:21:43.345 align:middle
Stop taking my picture!

00:21:43.428 --> 00:21:44.971 align:middle
Seriously, what happened?

00:21:45.055 --> 00:21:47.182 align:middle
You forget to put on
sunscreen yesterday?

00:21:47.265 --> 00:21:48.600 align:middle
[sighs]

00:21:48.683 --> 00:21:50.769 align:middle
I always spend this time
of year at Grandpa's house,

00:21:50.852 --> 00:21:52.187 align:middle
so I just...

00:21:52.270 --> 00:21:55.523 align:middle
It never occurred to me
to worry about getting a tan.

00:21:55.607 --> 00:21:58.109 align:middle
Man, I was so careless

00:21:58.193 --> 00:22:00.612 align:middle
But how am I the
only one who got tan?

00:22:00.695 --> 00:22:03.198 align:middle
The universe is totally unfair!

00:22:03.281 --> 00:22:04.449 align:middle
Anyway, this sucks!

00:22:04.532 --> 00:22:05.992 align:middle
I didn't ask to
come back looking like

00:22:06.076 --> 00:22:08.036 align:middle
a whole different girl!

00:22:08.119 --> 00:22:09.746 align:middle
No photos!

00:22:09.829 --> 00:22:11.539 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Hey, g'morning!

00:22:12.749 --> 00:22:15.377 align:middle
Don't you even start
with me, Takeda!

00:22:17.128 --> 00:22:19.130 align:middle
[laughs]

00:22:19.214 --> 00:22:20.423 align:middle
Wow, look at you!

00:22:20.507 --> 00:22:22.801 align:middle
You're like a little brown nut!
