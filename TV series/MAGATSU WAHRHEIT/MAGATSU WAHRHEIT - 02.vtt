It's been arranged.

They'll look the
other way, but that's all.

[ELFRIEDE]
Of course.

00:03:00.472 --> 00:03:03.683 position:50% align:center
If you screw up,
I can't help you. Got it?

00:03:03.767 --> 00:03:05.310 position:50% align:center
Goes without saying.

00:03:05.393 --> 00:03:06.936 position:50% align:center
That's it, then.

[DAMIAN groans]

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:50.563 position:50% align:center
What's next? What do we do?

00:03:50.647 --> 00:03:52.941 position:50% align:center
Oh. Well, for now
we head to one of

00:03:53.024 --> 00:03:55.652 position:50% align:center
our hideouts in a town
not far from here.

00:03:55.735 --> 00:03:59.155 position:50% align:center
"Our hideout" meaning
your organization's?

00:04:00.281 --> 00:04:01.408 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that's right.

00:04:01.491 --> 00:04:03.410 position:50% align:center
Then, from there,
we'll take you to a city

00:04:03.493 --> 00:04:05.704 position:50% align:center
with very little
Imperial presence.

00:04:05.787 --> 00:04:07.706 position:50% align:center
As little as you're
likely to find.

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:10.500 position:50% align:center
Unless, of course, you have
some other place in mind.

00:04:10.583 --> 00:04:11.418 position:50% align:center
Then we'll take you there.

00:04:11.501 --> 00:04:16.256 position:50% align:center
Oh, uh, I don't know.

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:18.633 position:50% align:center
I'll try to think of someplace.

00:04:24.723 --> 00:04:27.726 position:50% align:center
[SCHAAKE]
This symbol. Where've I seen it?

00:04:38.278 --> 00:04:40.655 position:50% align:center
You should try to
get some sleep, kid.

00:04:42.365 --> 00:04:44.534 position:50% align:center
Zaitz was a real stand-up guy.

00:04:44.617 --> 00:04:46.036 position:50% align:center
It's a shame.

00:04:46.119 --> 00:04:47.787 position:50% align:center
He was the whole
reason I joined.

00:04:47.871 --> 00:04:49.581 position:50% align:center
To help support us.

00:04:49.664 --> 00:04:51.291 position:50% align:center
So he wouldn't have to
work himself to death

00:04:51.374 --> 00:04:53.793 position:50% align:center
being our household's
sole earner.

00:04:55.754 --> 00:04:57.088 position:50% align:center
[CONRAD]
I see.

00:05:01.843 --> 00:05:03.553 position:50% align:center
Damn it all!

00:05:24.157 --> 00:05:27.911 position:50% align:center
This is for you.

00:05:29.454 --> 00:05:33.917 position:50% align:center

00:06:04.781 --> 00:06:08.159 position:50% align:center
She does. Luminosis.

00:06:08.243 --> 00:06:10.120 position:50% align:center
It's fairly common in this city,

00:06:10.203 --> 00:06:12.706 position:50% align:center
since there's Coldfire
so close to here.

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:15.500 position:50% align:center
It had been inactive
for about 20 years or so,

00:06:15.583 --> 00:06:18.003 position:50% align:center
but recently it started
flaring up again.

00:06:18.086 --> 00:06:20.338 position:50% align:center
The spread is slow
but significant.

00:06:20.422 --> 00:06:22.132 position:50% align:center
It won't be too long now

00:06:22.215 --> 00:06:25.427 position:50% align:center
before this city is abandoned,
like the others.

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:28.722 position:50% align:center
But I'm sure we've got
a few more decades.

00:06:28.805 --> 00:06:31.599 position:50% align:center
How serious is
the girl's condition?

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:37.105 position:50% align:center
Very. She's got maybe
six months or so.

00:06:40.025 --> 00:06:42.902 position:50% align:center
Wow, forgive me.
That's enough of that!

00:06:42.986 --> 00:06:44.320 position:50% align:center
Benjamin procured a vehicle,

00:06:44.404 --> 00:06:46.489 position:50% align:center
and he made it
safely out of the city.

00:06:46.573 --> 00:06:48.450 position:50% align:center
Now, eat your food.

00:06:52.454 --> 00:06:55.081 position:50% align:center
It's gone from bad to worse.

00:06:55.165 --> 00:06:58.126 position:50% align:center

by the Imperial Army.

[GIZRELLA]
It's no good.

00:07:23.651 --> 00:07:26.363 position:50% align:center
The army's patrolling even
more frequently than normal,

00:07:26.446 --> 00:07:28.114 position:50% align:center
and according to residents,

00:07:28.198 --> 00:07:30.033 position:50% align:center
huge volumes of
weapons and ammo

00:07:30.116 --> 00:07:33.203 position:50% align:center
were delivered to the armory.

00:07:33.286 --> 00:07:39.209 position:50% align:center
That's located here.
And also, there's this.

a wanted man in the Empire.

00:07:53.765 --> 00:07:54.516 position:50% align:center
hiding out here as well.

00:07:54.599 --> 00:07:56.059 position:50% align:center

Well, think about it.

00:08:24.921 --> 00:08:27.132 position:50% align:center
The Diet restricted
the trade of weapons

00:08:27.215 --> 00:08:29.801 position:50% align:center
and told these people to
defend the city on their own.

00:08:29.884 --> 00:08:31.469 position:50% align:center
How, exactly?

00:08:32.512 --> 00:08:34.973 position:50% align:center

won't dispatch enough troops

Though, since this is the entire
city we're talking about,

00:09:06.212 --> 00:09:08.590 position:50% align:center
might I put in a personal
request to top headquarters?

No. That won't be necessary.

And more importantly,
I need a favor.

00:09:57.305 --> 00:09:59.599 position:50% align:center
It looks like they
caught wind of us somehow.

00:09:59.683 --> 00:10:00.600 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:10:03.937 --> 00:10:06.189 position:50% align:center

Right after you arrived,

00:10:34.426 --> 00:10:37.178 position:50% align:center
one of those three
left the city to report.

That person was a longtime
acquaintance whom I trust.

00:10:40.306 --> 00:10:44.060 position:50% align:center

For now, let's get to

Oh, right. Unfortunately,

Though, we did find some signs
that they'd escaped underground,

00:11:45.288 --> 00:11:47.207 position:50% align:center
so the others are
going after them.

00:11:51.336 --> 00:11:54.255 position:50% align:center

there any other clues?

Uh, yes.

00:11:55.924 --> 00:11:58.551 position:50% align:center
We also found this.

I see.

00:12:01.096 --> 00:12:04.432 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO]
Um, sir? Forgive me,

00:12:04.516 --> 00:12:07.727 position:50% align:center

If he were sent to the Empire,

00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:11.564 position:50% align:center
he'd get the death

00:12:11.648 --> 00:12:13.358 position:50% align:center
So, don't you think
it's better for everyone

00:12:13.441 --> 00:12:15.276 position:50% align:center
if we make good use of him here?

Not only that, but there
are exits all over the city.

00:13:20.175 --> 00:13:22.260 position:50% align:center
We won't be easy to find.

00:13:22.344 --> 00:13:24.095 position:50% align:center
Anyway, there's a
guide who's familiar

00:13:24.179 --> 00:13:26.348 position:50% align:center
with the tunnels
meeting us up ahead.

00:13:26.431 --> 00:13:29.184 position:50% align:center
[INNUMAEL]
Oh really? Thank goodness.

00:13:30.018 --> 00:13:32.479 position:50% align:center
[GIZRELLA] Just stay close.
It's not far now.

00:13:33.813 --> 00:13:35.315 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:13:35.398 --> 00:13:39.444 position:50% align:center
[GIZRELLA] I'll slow them down.
You two, wait for them to pass.

00:13:49.204 --> 00:13:50.622 position:50% align:center
They gone?

00:13:50.705 --> 00:13:52.624 position:50% align:center
Seems so.

00:13:52.707 --> 00:13:54.626 position:50% align:center
Let's get the heck
out of this town

00:13:54.709 --> 00:13:56.961 position:50% align:center
while she's still
distracting them!

00:14:03.385 --> 00:14:04.594 position:50% align:center
[GIZRELLA'S DAUGHTER]
This way.

00:14:08.306 --> 00:14:10.183 position:50% align:center
Oh, it's you.

00:14:10.266 --> 00:14:14.854 position:50% align:center
[GIZRELLA panting]

00:14:29.786 --> 00:14:33.623 position:50% align:center
[MAN 02B] I see. So her
mother was your decoy?

00:14:35.333 --> 00:14:40.005 position:50% align:center
Don't worry about her.
She'll get away, I know it.

00:14:40.088 --> 00:14:42.882 position:50% align:center
[INNUMAEL] More importantly.
She told us there was a guide

00:14:42.966 --> 00:14:45.635 position:50% align:center
who could get us out of
the city undetected.

00:14:45.719 --> 00:14:47.012 position:50% align:center
What is your problem?

00:14:47.095 --> 00:14:52.267 position:50% align:center
Ah! I didn't mean it.

00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:54.519 position:50% align:center
She should be able to
get you out, no problem.

00:14:54.602 --> 00:14:55.770 position:50% align:center
[INNUMAEL, SCHAAKE gasp]

00:15:09.451 --> 00:15:10.785 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:15:25.258 --> 00:15:26.843 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIERS]
Hm?

00:15:28.762 --> 00:15:29.929 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:39.481 --> 00:15:41.775 position:50% align:center
Right. Let's finish
this business.

00:15:41.858 --> 00:15:43.109 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:48.281 position:50% align:center
[SCHAAKE]
Wow, these tunnels are massive.

00:15:48.365 --> 00:15:50.784 position:50% align:center
What could they
have been used for?

00:15:50.867 --> 00:15:54.496 position:50% align:center
My mom says they're
ancient transport tunnels.

00:15:54.579 --> 00:15:56.623 position:50% align:center
Supposedly train cars
with tons of people

00:15:56.706 --> 00:15:58.291 position:50% align:center
used to run through here.

00:15:58.375 --> 00:15:59.125 position:50% align:center
[SCHAAKE]
Whoa.

00:15:59.209 --> 00:16:01.169 position:50% align:center
[INNUMAEL]
That's amazing.

00:16:01.252 --> 00:16:03.463 position:50% align:center
Why don't you guys
just operate down here?

00:16:03.546 --> 00:16:05.882 position:50% align:center
Because some parts
are about to collapse,

00:16:05.965 --> 00:16:09.636 position:50% align:center
and when it rains other parts
can flood really badly.

00:16:14.724 --> 00:16:16.101 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:16:20.063 --> 00:16:21.189 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER 02C]
Hey.

00:16:22.857 --> 00:16:25.151 position:50% align:center
They've just captured
some woman.

00:16:25.235 --> 00:16:27.987 position:50% align:center
We've been ordered to return
to our positions right away.

00:16:28.071 --> 00:16:30.323 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER 02D]
Copy that. Will do.

00:16:30.407 --> 00:16:31.783 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER 02E]
This place is huge.

00:16:31.866 --> 00:16:33.868 position:50% align:center
We need more people
if we want to find them all.

00:16:33.952 --> 00:16:36.204 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER 02D] Yeah, well,
the exits are sealed off.

00:16:36.287 --> 00:16:37.872 position:50% align:center
They can't get out of here.

00:16:37.956 --> 00:16:40.208 position:50% align:center
[SCHAAKE]
A woman? Does that mean?

00:16:40.291 --> 00:16:44.879 position:50% align:center
[GIZRELLA'S DAUGHTER coughing]

00:16:47.549 --> 00:16:48.717 position:50% align:center
You okay?

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:53.596 position:50% align:center
[GIZRELLA'S DAUGHTER coughing]

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:56.349 position:50% align:center
Okay. You go on ahead with her.
Meet up with Benjamin.

00:16:56.433 --> 00:16:59.728 position:50% align:center
Uh, what? But where
are you going?

00:16:59.811 --> 00:17:01.312 position:50% align:center
To save her mother, where else?

00:17:01.396 --> 00:17:03.148 position:50% align:center
Wait. Hold on a sec!

00:17:03.231 --> 00:17:05.025 position:50% align:center
Yeah? What?

00:17:35.555 --> 00:17:38.725 position:50% align:center
Well, no wonder they were able
to find out so much about us.

00:17:38.808 --> 00:17:40.727 position:50% align:center
[HELMAN]
Yes, but you should be proud.

00:17:40.810 --> 00:17:43.688 position:50% align:center
He displayed commendable
willpower throughout the ordeal.

00:17:43.772 --> 00:17:45.774 position:50% align:center
Really! It was quite
a hassle to get him

00:17:45.857 --> 00:17:48.651 position:50% align:center
to divulge anything at all,
to be honest with you.

00:17:48.735 --> 00:17:50.612 position:50% align:center
You are a monster.

00:17:50.695 --> 00:17:52.489 position:50% align:center
[HELMAN] I believe
there is someone among you

00:17:52.572 --> 00:17:54.491 position:50% align:center
who disguised himself
as a delivery man.

00:17:54.574 --> 00:17:56.743 position:50% align:center
I'm sure that rings a bell.

00:17:56.826 --> 00:17:58.828 position:50% align:center
The thing is,
he happened to kill

00:17:58.912 --> 00:18:01.206 position:50% align:center
one of my very best soldiers,

00:18:01.289 --> 00:18:03.083 position:50% align:center
and I know someone
who's absolutely

00:18:03.166 --> 00:18:05.377 position:50% align:center
heartbroken over the loss.

00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:06.878 position:50% align:center
Drop the act.

00:18:06.961 --> 00:18:09.130 position:50% align:center
I mean, do you
expect me to believe

00:18:09.214 --> 00:18:11.508 position:50% align:center
you're capable of empathy?

00:18:23.228 --> 00:18:26.356 position:50% align:center
So, it really was
connected, then.

00:18:26.439 --> 00:18:28.400 position:50% align:center
[SCHAAKE]
What? You're kidding, right?

00:18:28.483 --> 00:18:29.901 position:50% align:center
I've never been myself,

00:18:29.984 --> 00:18:34.030 position:50% align:center
but mama said it connects to
the army base that's there.

00:18:34.114 --> 00:18:38.410 position:50% align:center
This means if your mom's
information is accurate.

00:18:38.493 --> 00:18:40.995 position:50% align:center
Okay. Are you really
up for this?

00:18:41.079 --> 00:18:44.874 position:50% align:center
Uh... Yeah, of course, why?

00:18:48.628 --> 00:18:51.506 position:50% align:center
Thank you. You can go now.

00:19:06.563 --> 00:19:13.319 position:50% align:center
[pants] Why must you
insist on being so obstinate?

00:19:13.403 --> 00:19:15.113 position:50% align:center
If you would only talk,
then you wouldn't have to

00:19:15.196 --> 00:19:18.700 position:50% align:center
go through so much pain.
Don't you understand?

00:19:20.326 --> 00:19:22.078 position:50% align:center
[HELMAN]
Quick question.

00:19:22.162 --> 00:19:24.622 position:50% align:center
You are from this city,
are you not?

00:19:24.706 --> 00:19:26.708 position:50% align:center
Does this frock
look familiar to you?

00:19:26.791 --> 00:19:28.084 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:34.257 --> 00:19:35.091 position:50% align:center
[RESIDENT 02A]
What was that?

00:19:35.175 --> 00:19:36.509 position:50% align:center
[RESIDENT 02B]
What happened?

00:19:39.304 --> 00:19:40.430 position:50% align:center
[INNUMAEL]
Pardon me, sir!

00:19:40.513 --> 00:19:42.390 position:50% align:center
But the armory has
just been attacked.

00:19:42.474 --> 00:19:44.184 position:50% align:center
The number of
intruders is unknown!

00:19:44.267 --> 00:19:46.644 position:50% align:center
Soldiers are putting out
the fires as we speak!

00:19:46.728 --> 00:19:48.146 position:50% align:center
[HELMAN]
Shit!

00:20:06.998 --> 00:20:09.918 position:50% align:center
[GIZRELLA]
Innumael, is that you?

00:20:40.365 --> 00:20:44.828 position:50% align:center
So, what inspired you to
help with the rescue mission?

00:20:47.372 --> 00:20:49.332 position:50% align:center
[INNUMAEL]
Nothing special.

00:20:51.543 --> 00:20:52.752 position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:20:55.797 --> 00:20:57.590 position:50% align:center
--Heads up.
--Huh?

00:21:11.521 --> 00:21:13.064 position:50% align:center
[CONRAD]
What's your order?

00:21:13.148 --> 00:21:15.608 position:50% align:center
Should we continue
the search for them?

00:21:15.692 --> 00:21:19.154 position:50% align:center
No. They will have already
left the city by now.

00:21:19.237 --> 00:21:21.448 position:50% align:center
It'd be futile.

00:21:21.531 --> 00:21:22.782 position:50% align:center
[knocking]

00:21:22.866 --> 00:21:24.451 position:50% align:center
Come in.

00:21:24.534 --> 00:21:27.078 position:50% align:center
[BRANCH HEAD 02A]
This is what you requested.

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:38.840 position:50% align:center
Hi, little sister.

00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:31.685 position:50% align:center
