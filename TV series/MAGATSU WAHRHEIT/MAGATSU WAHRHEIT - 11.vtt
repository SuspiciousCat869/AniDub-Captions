[LEOCADIO panting]

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.504 position:50% align:center
I finally got outta there.

00:02:09.587 --> 00:02:12.340 position:50% align:center
Okay, so what do I do now?

00:02:29.274 --> 00:02:31.568 position:50% align:center
[IRMA sighs]
Why'd you go and agree to do

00:02:31.651 --> 00:02:33.028 position:50% align:center
something for the Knights?

00:02:33.111 --> 00:02:35.864 position:50% align:center
Come on! And a meeting with
the Emperor of all things?

00:02:35.947 --> 00:02:37.657 position:50% align:center
No way that's going
to happen, guys!

00:02:37.741 --> 00:02:41.619 position:50% align:center
Well, this letter is gonna
get me in the door, supposedly.

00:02:41.703 --> 00:02:44.456 position:50% align:center
Hey, by the way, do you know
where Leocadio is right now?

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:45.957 position:50% align:center
I'm pretty sure he can
help me as well.

00:02:46.041 --> 00:02:47.417 position:50% align:center
--Have you seen him?
--[IRMA] They arrested him.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.002 position:50% align:center
What for?

00:02:50.211 --> 00:02:52.172 position:50% align:center
Do you remember that
mental institution

00:02:52.255 --> 00:02:54.007 position:50% align:center
you infiltrated the other day?

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.467 position:50% align:center
--[ARNOLT] Yeah.
--[BENJAMIN] That abandoned one?

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.011 position:50% align:center
[IRMA] Yep. Leo had got
a feeling that it might be

00:02:58.094 --> 00:02:59.512 position:50% align:center
secretly connected to a certain

00:02:59.596 --> 00:03:01.806 position:50% align:center
drug development
organization, somehow.

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:02.849 position:50% align:center
But how?

00:03:02.932 --> 00:03:04.684 position:50% align:center
[IRMA]
Something about luminosis.

00:03:04.768 --> 00:03:06.269 position:50% align:center
Luminosis?

00:03:06.353 --> 00:03:08.521 position:50% align:center
[IRMA] Yeah. So anyway,
we went to see an acquaintance

00:03:08.605 --> 00:03:11.441 position:50% align:center
of Leo's who worked
at the drug place.

00:03:11.524 --> 00:03:13.693 position:50% align:center
Maybe the fact that he
and I went sniffing around

00:03:13.777 --> 00:03:16.780 position:50% align:center
about that made the
military suspicious of Leo.

00:03:16.863 --> 00:03:17.989 position:50% align:center
[ARNOLT]
So, were you able to sniff out

00:03:18.073 --> 00:03:20.784 position:50% align:center
any additional info
about that organization?

00:03:22.702 --> 00:03:25.997 position:50% align:center
The guy mentioned that
the CEO had been replaced.

00:03:26.081 --> 00:03:28.458 position:50% align:center
--Rad-something?
--Was it Radboud? Maybe?

00:03:28.541 --> 00:03:31.878 position:50% align:center
[IRMA]
Yeah, that! Hey, how'd you know?

00:03:46.017 --> 00:03:47.143 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:03:48.978 --> 00:03:50.313 position:50% align:center
--What the--?
--Oh, hi.

00:03:50.397 --> 00:03:52.440 position:50% align:center
Uh, hey everyone.

00:03:52.524 --> 00:03:54.693 position:50% align:center
Didn't you get arrested?

00:03:54.776 --> 00:03:57.904 position:50% align:center
Broke yourself out
of jail? Nice! [laughs]

00:03:57.987 --> 00:03:59.322 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO]
Hey, keep your voice down!

00:03:59.406 --> 00:04:00.323 position:50% align:center
My bad, man.

00:04:00.407 --> 00:04:02.659 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO]
Trying to blow my cover?

00:04:02.742 --> 00:04:05.078 position:50% align:center
More importantly, I see
you guys made it back safely.

00:04:05.161 --> 00:04:06.663 position:50% align:center
Yeah, a minute ago.

00:04:06.746 --> 00:04:09.541 position:50% align:center
This is actually perfect timing.

00:04:09.624 --> 00:04:12.836 position:50% align:center
We were wondering how
we'd do this without you.

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:14.045 position:50% align:center
Oh, uh! That is,

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:15.922 position:50% align:center
if you're still willing
to help us, obviously!

00:04:16.006 --> 00:04:18.758 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO] It's fine.
Don't worry about it.

00:04:19.926 --> 00:04:23.221 position:50% align:center
[CONRAD] This whole thing has
gotten pretty complicated, huh.

00:04:23.304 --> 00:04:25.557 position:50% align:center
So, this Garnet Tablet
predicted that a disaster

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.142 position:50% align:center
will soon befall the capital,

00:04:27.225 --> 00:04:28.893 position:50% align:center
and in order to do
something about it,

00:04:28.977 --> 00:04:30.603 position:50% align:center
the Emperor's gonna
have to bust out this,

00:04:30.687 --> 00:04:32.230 position:50% align:center
uh, whatcha-ma-call it?

00:04:32.313 --> 00:04:33.982 position:50% align:center
The Lubricant Stream
or something?

00:04:34.065 --> 00:04:35.358 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO, INNUMAEL]
Luminous Seed.

00:04:35.442 --> 00:04:37.527 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that! He's using
this Luminous Seed

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.780 position:50% align:center
to try to weaken the impact of
the big calamity or whatever,

00:04:40.864 --> 00:04:42.574 position:50% align:center
but the Anti-imperialist
Diet members

00:04:42.657 --> 00:04:44.993 position:50% align:center
totally want to use it for evil.

00:04:45.076 --> 00:04:46.536 position:50% align:center
Dang. Do you honestly
think this is something

00:04:46.619 --> 00:04:48.496 position:50% align:center
we can really do anything about?

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.166 position:50% align:center
No. We'll just tell
His Majesty the Emperor

00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:54.794 position:50% align:center
what the Anti-imperialists
are doing, and afterwards,

00:04:54.878 --> 00:04:57.881 position:50% align:center
it'll just have to be
up to him, I guess. Or--

00:04:57.964 --> 00:05:00.925 position:50% align:center
Well, then. As far as this
light-inducing Luminous Seed,

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:02.886 position:50% align:center
I'll get it out of
the capital myself.

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:04.512 position:50% align:center
Be careful.

00:05:04.596 --> 00:05:06.181 position:50% align:center
Don't worry about me.

00:05:06.264 --> 00:05:07.891 position:50% align:center
It'll all work out, 'kay?

00:05:07.974 --> 00:05:12.562 position:50% align:center
Um, Leocadio?
I need to ask you a favor.

00:05:13.521 --> 00:05:16.691 position:50% align:center
[INNUMAEL] Listen. I heard you
know someone who makes medicine.

00:05:16.775 --> 00:05:18.109 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO]
I do.

00:05:18.193 --> 00:05:20.028 position:50% align:center
[INNUMAEL] Think you could
maybe introduce me to him?

00:05:20.111 --> 00:05:22.238 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO]
Huh? What for?

00:05:23.573 --> 00:05:25.283 position:50% align:center
I want to attempt
an infiltration

00:05:25.367 --> 00:05:27.744 position:50% align:center
of the drug
development facility.

00:05:27.827 --> 00:05:28.745 position:50% align:center
Whoa, really?

00:05:28.828 --> 00:05:30.622 position:50% align:center
[INNUMAEL]
Yeah.

00:05:30.705 --> 00:05:33.708 position:50% align:center
I was thinking about
going there before.

00:05:33.792 --> 00:05:35.752 position:50% align:center
But what's the point
of doing it now?

00:05:35.835 --> 00:05:37.962 position:50% align:center
The Anti-imperialists.

00:05:38.046 --> 00:05:39.130 position:50% align:center
Commander Georg hinted that

00:05:39.214 --> 00:05:41.633 position:50% align:center
there might be
evidence of them there.

00:05:41.716 --> 00:05:43.385 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
On Radboud?

00:05:43.468 --> 00:05:44.886 position:50% align:center
[INNUMAEL]
That's part of it.

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:46.930 position:50% align:center
But there's--
there's also something

00:05:47.013 --> 00:05:49.474 position:50% align:center
I'm curious about, personally.

00:05:49.557 --> 00:05:52.644 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO] Well, I guess that's
all right, but I'm busy.

00:05:52.727 --> 00:05:54.521 position:50% align:center
Can you handle the
introduction for me, Irma?

00:05:54.604 --> 00:05:56.398 position:50% align:center
[IRMA]
Of course. Better get going.

00:05:56.481 --> 00:05:58.566 position:50% align:center
[CONRAD]
Sorry, hold on a minute.

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:01.611 position:50% align:center
Innumael, you got a sec to chat?

00:06:01.695 --> 00:06:03.154 position:50% align:center
[INNUMAEL]
Huh?

00:06:03.238 --> 00:06:04.739 position:50% align:center
[CONRAD] I have something I'd
like to discuss in private.

00:06:04.823 --> 00:06:06.408 position:50% align:center
[INNUMAEL]
Oh, okay.

00:06:06.491 --> 00:06:07.659 position:50% align:center
Cool. We'll be waiting outside

00:06:07.742 --> 00:06:09.369 position:50% align:center
whenever you're
ready to go, 'kay?

00:06:09.452 --> 00:06:10.662 position:50% align:center
[INNUMAEL]
Sissel.

00:06:10.745 --> 00:06:12.080 position:50% align:center
Okay.

00:06:22.382 --> 00:06:23.299 position:50% align:center
[CONRAD sighs]

00:06:23.383 --> 00:06:25.677 position:50% align:center
So, whaddaya wanna talk about?

00:06:26.928 --> 00:06:31.433 position:50% align:center
Just this. How about you?

00:06:31.516 --> 00:06:37.063 position:50% align:center
Right, so--
This is how I'm doing.

00:06:37.147 --> 00:06:40.942 position:50% align:center
You're better than me, at least.
But still pretty serious.

00:06:41.026 --> 00:06:42.777 position:50% align:center
I've got a dull ache
in my whole body

00:06:42.861 --> 00:06:46.573 position:50% align:center
and fatigue that won't quit.
Guess I'm a goner, huh.

00:06:46.656 --> 00:06:48.033 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:06:48.116 --> 00:06:51.077 position:50% align:center
[CONRAD] Are you planning
to tell your sister?

00:06:51.161 --> 00:06:52.787 position:50% align:center
I can't.

00:06:52.871 --> 00:06:56.332 position:50% align:center
Listen. I need to
ask something of you.

00:07:01.755 --> 00:07:03.715 position:50% align:center
[IRMA]
Good evening!

00:07:08.511 --> 00:07:09.846 position:50% align:center
[FAUST]
It's you.

00:07:09.929 --> 00:07:11.431 position:50% align:center
Hey, there!

00:07:11.514 --> 00:07:12.599 position:50% align:center
[FAUST]
Where's Leocadio?

00:07:12.682 --> 00:07:15.435 position:50% align:center
Oh, um, he had plans.

00:07:15.518 --> 00:07:18.063 position:50% align:center
Long story short,
we were kind of hoping

00:07:18.146 --> 00:07:20.231 position:50% align:center
you would help him
infiltrate the place.

00:07:20.315 --> 00:07:22.233 position:50% align:center
Ah, interesting.

00:07:22.317 --> 00:07:25.195 position:50% align:center
Um, you think I might be able
to have your assistance?

00:07:25.278 --> 00:07:26.237 position:50% align:center
[FAUST]
Sure, fine.

00:07:26.321 --> 00:07:27.489 position:50% align:center
That easy?

00:07:27.572 --> 00:07:30.200 position:50% align:center
It's no more than what
we originally agreed to.

00:07:30.283 --> 00:07:33.620 position:50% align:center
Of course, you haven't forgotten
what I want, have you?

00:07:33.703 --> 00:07:35.872 position:50% align:center
Who, us? No way!

00:07:35.955 --> 00:07:37.165 position:50% align:center
Uh, remind me?

00:07:37.248 --> 00:07:39.751 position:50% align:center
It was just to give
him any documents

00:07:39.834 --> 00:07:41.378 position:50% align:center
from the human experiments.

00:07:41.461 --> 00:07:42.253 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:07:42.337 --> 00:07:43.755 position:50% align:center
What choice do we have?

00:07:43.838 --> 00:07:46.383 position:50% align:center
We're asking him to do something
that's pretty risky, too!

00:07:46.466 --> 00:07:47.884 position:50% align:center
--Hello?
--[INNUMAEL, IRMA] Yes!

00:07:47.967 --> 00:07:50.887 position:50% align:center
Here, take this security
card for authorized visitors.

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:54.015 position:50% align:center
You should probably
have my card as well.

00:07:54.099 --> 00:07:55.600 position:50% align:center
Cool, thanks!

00:07:55.684 --> 00:07:57.727 position:50% align:center
[FAUST]
That will get you inside.

00:07:57.811 --> 00:08:00.271 position:50% align:center
Lastly, you should do it
two days from now.

00:08:00.355 --> 00:08:01.731 position:50% align:center
How come?

00:08:01.815 --> 00:08:04.192 position:50% align:center
The facility is undergoing
scheduled maintenance then.

00:08:04.275 --> 00:08:05.610 position:50% align:center
People will be
expecting new faces

00:08:05.694 --> 00:08:08.321 position:50% align:center
around the place that day,
so no one will bat an eye.

00:08:08.405 --> 00:08:10.407 position:50% align:center
Good call. What else?

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:12.534 position:50% align:center
[FAUST] I've already
given you more than enough.

00:08:12.617 --> 00:08:14.577 position:50% align:center
You can handle
the rest yourselves.

00:08:14.661 --> 00:08:18.707 position:50% align:center
Yes, understood,
and we're very grateful, sir.

00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:22.669 position:50% align:center
What's that face? Don't worry!

00:08:22.752 --> 00:08:24.337 position:50% align:center
It'll work out
somehow, probably--

00:08:24.421 --> 00:08:26.589 position:50% align:center
Don't forget about
those documents.

00:08:26.673 --> 00:08:29.134 position:50% align:center
I am eager to
review them for myself.

00:08:29.217 --> 00:08:31.511 position:50% align:center
Find me in the new capital.

00:08:31.594 --> 00:08:32.721 position:50% align:center
[ARNOLT]
What about Fritz?

00:08:32.804 --> 00:08:33.972 position:50% align:center
No word.

00:08:34.055 --> 00:08:36.182 position:50% align:center
I asked all the other
members in the capital.

00:08:36.266 --> 00:08:37.892 position:50% align:center
They got nothing. Zilch.

00:08:37.976 --> 00:08:39.102 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO] I don't know
who this "Fritz" guy

00:08:39.185 --> 00:08:40.603 position:50% align:center
you're talking about is,

00:08:40.687 --> 00:08:43.356 position:50% align:center
but I'd prefer not to involve
anyone else, if possible.

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:44.858 position:50% align:center
You're right.

00:08:44.941 --> 00:08:47.527 position:50% align:center
We don't know for sure who
the traitor in Headkeeper is.

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:49.988 position:50% align:center
We should handle
this ourselves for now.

00:08:50.071 --> 00:08:51.448 position:50% align:center
Good idea. We'll go ahead and

00:08:51.531 --> 00:08:53.783 position:50% align:center
conduct the operation
two nights from now.

00:08:53.867 --> 00:08:56.161 position:50% align:center
So, to review everything that
we've already discussed,

00:08:56.244 --> 00:08:58.538 position:50% align:center
the ones who'll be stealing
the original Luminous Seed

00:08:58.621 --> 00:09:02.625 position:50% align:center
and taking it far away from the
capital are myself and the kid.

00:09:02.709 --> 00:09:04.210 position:50% align:center

I have a name, you know!

00:09:04.294 --> 00:09:05.587 position:50% align:center
It's Leocadio.

00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:08.506 position:50% align:center
Ben and I will take
the drug facility. Right, Ben?

00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:10.884 position:50% align:center
[BENJAMIN]
Mm. So, say we find it.

00:09:10.967 --> 00:09:13.386 position:50% align:center
Evidence of Radboud
and the Anti-imperialists.

00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:15.930 position:50% align:center
Then the next step is
preparing to see the Emperor.

00:09:16.014 --> 00:09:17.349 position:50% align:center
And don't worry!

00:09:17.432 --> 00:09:20.769 position:50% align:center
As for the getaway car,
you can leave all that to me!

00:09:20.852 --> 00:09:22.937 position:50% align:center
Also, here's some
more information

00:09:23.021 --> 00:09:24.564 position:50% align:center
that I was able to get.

00:09:24.647 --> 00:09:26.858 position:50% align:center
Part of the Diet moved
to the new capital.

00:09:26.941 --> 00:09:29.819 position:50% align:center
Pretty much the entire House
of Peers, as a matter of fact.

00:09:29.903 --> 00:09:30.695 position:50% align:center
[INNUMAEL gasps]

00:09:30.779 --> 00:09:31.821 position:50% align:center
The other members are keeping

00:09:31.905 --> 00:09:33.990 position:50% align:center
their ears to
the ground for now.

00:09:34.074 --> 00:09:37.118 position:50% align:center
Anyway, in terms
of the, um, Cradle?

00:09:37.202 --> 00:09:38.578 position:50% align:center
It's on the outer wall.

00:09:38.661 --> 00:09:41.915 position:50% align:center
They say they can hear
a low sound coming from it.

00:09:41.998 --> 00:09:45.168 position:50% align:center
The weather's been getting
worse for several days.

00:09:45.251 --> 00:09:48.546 position:50% align:center
And yet, oddly, most of
the military squads left.

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:49.839 position:50% align:center
They've been sent away
from the capital

00:09:49.923 --> 00:09:52.175 position:50% align:center
on expeditions despite
the bad weather.

00:09:52.258 --> 00:09:54.844 position:50% align:center
Which either means that
the disaster is imminent,

00:09:54.928 --> 00:09:57.305 position:50% align:center
or it's just a coincidence.

00:09:57.389 --> 00:10:00.892 position:50% align:center
That said, those conditions
are perfect for our purposes.

00:10:00.975 --> 00:10:02.644 position:50% align:center
The more soldiers
that are deployed,

00:10:02.727 --> 00:10:05.480 position:50% align:center
the easier it will be
for us to move around.

00:10:13.738 --> 00:10:15.949 position:50% align:center
[INNUMAEL] So, uh, whaddaya
wanna talk about?

00:10:16.032 --> 00:10:19.411 position:50% align:center
I figured we should at least
have a conversation.

00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:30.422 position:50% align:center
Oh, hey, I've been
meaning to ask.

00:10:30.505 --> 00:10:33.008 position:50% align:center
You kinda just, like,
broke out of prison, right?

00:10:33.091 --> 00:10:34.467 position:50% align:center
How'd you do it?

00:10:34.551 --> 00:10:36.219 position:50% align:center
I went underground.

00:10:36.302 --> 00:10:37.470 position:50% align:center
The area beneath the prison

00:10:37.554 --> 00:10:39.597 position:50% align:center
connects to the
off-limits subway.

00:10:39.681 --> 00:10:41.850 position:50% align:center
You know, where the lady that
turned into a monster died?

00:10:41.933 --> 00:10:43.476 position:50% align:center
Wait, for real?

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:44.686 position:50% align:center
I had help.

00:10:44.769 --> 00:10:46.730 position:50% align:center
A member of Headkeeper
planned the escape.

00:10:46.813 --> 00:10:48.231 position:50% align:center
Uh, a member?

00:10:48.314 --> 00:10:51.776 position:50% align:center
Yeah, the one we captured
that first time we fought.

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:53.820 position:50% align:center
You know, in the canyon?

00:10:53.903 --> 00:10:56.239 position:50% align:center
But sadly, he died in the end.

00:10:56.322 --> 00:10:57.907 position:50% align:center
Oh, I see.

00:10:59.325 --> 00:11:01.119 position:50% align:center
I gotta ask.

00:11:01.202 --> 00:11:03.872 position:50% align:center
Are you really
a member of Headkeeper?

00:11:05.749 --> 00:11:07.375 position:50% align:center
No, not really.

00:11:07.459 --> 00:11:11.963 position:50% align:center
I knew it. I thought
it was weird.

00:11:12.047 --> 00:11:15.717 position:50% align:center
From what Sissel said about you,
you seemed like the timid type,

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:18.386 position:50% align:center
doing honest work to save up
money for your family.

00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:20.263 position:50% align:center
Spot on.

00:11:20.347 --> 00:11:23.183 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO] You know, that day
I met you in the warehouse,

00:11:23.266 --> 00:11:28.188 position:50% align:center
you were working hard, sending
money home for your sister.

00:11:28.271 --> 00:11:29.397 position:50% align:center
[INNUMAEL]
Yeah.

00:11:29.481 --> 00:11:32.942 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO] Honestly,
I wanted to be like you.

00:11:33.026 --> 00:11:36.363 position:50% align:center
To afford nice things for my
family every once in a while.

00:11:37.489 --> 00:11:39.532 position:50% align:center
You mean, your brother?

00:11:39.616 --> 00:11:41.534 position:50% align:center
Yeah, how did you find out?

00:11:41.618 --> 00:11:43.495 position:50% align:center
[INNUMAEL]
Conrad told me.

00:11:43.578 --> 00:11:48.333 position:50% align:center
He said the guy I--the guy
I killed was your brother.

00:11:52.337 --> 00:11:55.632 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO] We weren't
related by blood, but yeah.

00:11:55.715 --> 00:11:58.051 position:50% align:center
[INNUMAEL]
Listen, I know an apology

00:11:58.134 --> 00:12:02.889 position:50% align:center
is kind of meaningless here,
but I'm sorry.

00:12:02.972 --> 00:12:04.933 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO]
Is that all you got?

00:12:05.016 --> 00:12:08.645 position:50% align:center
So, you want to hear
the story? All of it?

00:12:10.021 --> 00:12:12.482 position:50% align:center
No thanks.

00:12:12.565 --> 00:12:14.859 position:50% align:center
Not yet anyway.

00:12:14.943 --> 00:12:18.697 position:50% align:center
When all this over,
maybe we can talk again then.

00:12:27.163 --> 00:12:28.331 position:50% align:center
Okay.

00:12:41.678 --> 00:12:44.347 position:50% align:center
This uniform's a little tight
through the shoulders.

00:12:44.431 --> 00:12:47.267 position:50% align:center
Conrad's skinny.
You'll have to deal with it.

00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:49.436 position:50% align:center
[ARNOLT] This place looks like
it's practically deserted.

00:12:49.519 --> 00:12:51.479 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO] I wonder how many
soldiers are currently deployed

00:12:51.563 --> 00:12:52.981 position:50% align:center
in the new capital right now?

00:12:53.064 --> 00:12:54.441 position:50% align:center
[ARNOLT]
Wait, you don't know?

00:12:54.524 --> 00:12:56.693 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO] I've only been
on the job two weeks.

00:12:56.776 --> 00:12:59.070 position:50% align:center
[ARNOLT] So, do you know
where this place is?

00:12:59.154 --> 00:13:01.489 position:50% align:center
The one that the woman you
met in solitary mentioned?

00:13:01.573 --> 00:13:03.283 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO]
Special forces offices.

00:13:03.366 --> 00:13:05.201 position:50% align:center
Unlike my squad,
they're elite soldiers,

00:13:05.285 --> 00:13:06.953 position:50% align:center
the best of the best.

00:13:07.037 --> 00:13:08.997 position:50% align:center
Rumor has it that
those guys receive

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:11.124 position:50% align:center
secret orders directly
from the Emperor.

00:13:11.207 --> 00:13:13.585 position:50% align:center
Well, it seems like
the rumors are true.

00:13:30.352 --> 00:13:32.729 position:50% align:center
Man, it's really
coming down now.

00:13:32.812 --> 00:13:35.357 position:50% align:center
[ARNOLT]
Yeah. Be careful not to slip.

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:38.193 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO] Not a problem.
I'm pretty good at this.

00:13:47.702 --> 00:13:49.454 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO] This is where
the real challenge begins.

00:13:49.537 --> 00:13:51.373 position:50% align:center
[ARNOLT]
Oh, so you're an expert now?

00:13:51.456 --> 00:13:54.250 position:50% align:center
You've only been to this place
a few times, haven't you?

00:13:54.334 --> 00:13:56.836 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO] I guess I'm
just a little overexcited.

00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:59.589 position:50% align:center
[ARNOLT] You were quaking in
your boots when we first met.

00:13:59.673 --> 00:14:01.466 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO]
What? When was that?

00:14:01.549 --> 00:14:03.843 position:50% align:center
[ARNOLT] In the canyon.
How could you forget?

00:14:06.304 --> 00:14:10.100 position:50% align:center
Hang on! You're that guy?
I can't believe it!

00:14:10.183 --> 00:14:12.185 position:50% align:center
It warms this
old guy's heart to see

00:14:12.268 --> 00:14:15.605 position:50% align:center
a young person become
a man so quickly!

00:14:15.689 --> 00:14:16.940 position:50% align:center
Oh great, jokes.

00:14:17.023 --> 00:14:19.192 position:50% align:center
Save that energy
for the operation.

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:28.910 position:50% align:center
Okay, so where
do we go from here?

00:14:28.993 --> 00:14:30.078 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO]
I have no idea.

00:14:30.161 --> 00:14:31.413 position:50% align:center
What?

00:14:31.496 --> 00:14:33.873 position:50% align:center
Well, yeah. I mean,
only the special forces guys

00:14:33.957 --> 00:14:36.334 position:50% align:center
were ever allowed to
set foot back in this area.

00:14:36.418 --> 00:14:37.961 position:50% align:center
[ARNOLT]
So, from here on out--

00:14:38.044 --> 00:14:39.713 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO]
It's the luck of the draw.

00:14:39.796 --> 00:14:40.714 position:50% align:center
We're flying blind.

00:14:40.797 --> 00:14:43.383 position:50% align:center
Oh, how very encouraging.

00:14:49.556 --> 00:14:52.475 position:50% align:center
Good evening, gentlemen.
Are you two working here today?

00:14:52.559 --> 00:14:55.353 position:50% align:center
Oh, no! I, uh-- I just forgot
some documents here!

00:14:55.437 --> 00:14:57.397 position:50% align:center
Understood, sir.
Please be aware that

00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:59.566 position:50% align:center
the maintenance crew
has already started.

00:14:59.649 --> 00:15:00.942 position:50% align:center
Please be careful.

00:15:01.026 --> 00:15:02.610 position:50% align:center
[INNUMAEL]
We will, thanks.

00:15:02.694 --> 00:15:04.654 position:50% align:center
Yes, thanks for the heads up.

00:15:06.197 --> 00:15:08.867 position:50% align:center
[BENJAMIN] That was almost
too easy, kind of anticlimactic.

00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:11.119 position:50% align:center
[INNUMAEL chuckles]
Yeah.

00:15:11.202 --> 00:15:13.747 position:50% align:center
So, now that we're in,
what's next?

00:15:13.830 --> 00:15:17.500 position:50% align:center
Let's see. According to Faust,

00:15:17.584 --> 00:15:19.544 position:50% align:center
the guest cards will
only grant us access

00:15:19.627 --> 00:15:23.006 position:50% align:center
to these areas,
buildings A through C.

00:15:23.089 --> 00:15:24.382 position:50% align:center
All right, then.

00:15:24.466 --> 00:15:26.760 position:50% align:center
That's the one I have,
so I can enter those buildings.

00:15:26.843 --> 00:15:28.428 position:50% align:center
And I have the employee pass,

00:15:28.511 --> 00:15:31.097 position:50% align:center
which grants us
access to everything.

00:15:31.181 --> 00:15:33.558 position:50% align:center
[BENJAMIN] So, we'll need
yours to get into building D.

00:15:33.641 --> 00:15:36.186 position:50% align:center
That's right.
Should we get going?

00:15:40.899 --> 00:15:43.318 position:50% align:center
Jeez. This place is
really cleared out, huh.

00:15:43.401 --> 00:15:44.694 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:15:46.029 --> 00:15:48.448 position:50% align:center
Hey, Innumael?
Let's finish this ASAP.

00:15:48.531 --> 00:15:49.991 position:50% align:center
Sure, why?

00:15:50.075 --> 00:15:52.827 position:50% align:center
Don't you think it's strange
there are so few people here?

00:15:52.911 --> 00:15:55.330 position:50% align:center
[INNUMAEL] Well,
it is nine o'clock at night.

00:15:55.413 --> 00:15:56.956 position:50% align:center
Isn't this normal for nine?

00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:59.042 position:50% align:center
Back at reception,
they cautioned us

00:15:59.125 --> 00:16:01.961 position:50% align:center
that the maintenance
workers had already started.

00:16:02.045 --> 00:16:03.505 position:50% align:center
But this whole time,
we haven't seen

00:16:03.588 --> 00:16:06.049 position:50% align:center
one researcher or
maintenance worker.

00:16:06.132 --> 00:16:07.717 position:50% align:center
[INNUMAEL]
Yeah, you're right.

00:16:07.801 --> 00:16:11.846 position:50% align:center
It's a little soon, but maybe
we should just split up now.

00:16:13.139 --> 00:16:14.849 position:50% align:center
Catch up with you later, then.

00:16:35.286 --> 00:16:36.496 position:50% align:center
What's all this?

00:16:36.579 --> 00:16:39.040 position:50% align:center
Whoa, incredible.

00:16:39.124 --> 00:16:41.084 position:50% align:center
It's probably all evidence.

00:16:41.167 --> 00:16:43.336 position:50% align:center
This place is almost
like a museum.

00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:44.838 position:50% align:center
[ARNOLT]
I think you're right.

00:16:44.921 --> 00:16:46.506 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO]
So, what does it look like?

00:16:46.589 --> 00:16:48.550 position:50% align:center
This, uh, Luminous Seed thing?

00:16:48.633 --> 00:16:51.469 position:50% align:center
[ARNOLT] I've only ever seen
the attempted reproduction,

00:16:51.553 --> 00:16:55.098 position:50% align:center
so I'm not sure, but that was
a glass cylinder about this big.

00:16:55.181 --> 00:16:58.727 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO gasps]
Over there. Is that it?

00:16:58.810 --> 00:17:01.521 position:50% align:center
[ARNOLT]
No doubt about it. This is it.

00:17:02.939 --> 00:17:05.817 position:50% align:center
Now, then. What do you
say we get out of here?

00:17:08.153 --> 00:17:09.487 position:50% align:center
What's that--!

00:17:09.571 --> 00:17:12.407 position:50% align:center
An alarm system! A magical one!

00:17:14.034 --> 00:17:15.285 position:50% align:center
Shit!

00:17:20.623 --> 00:17:23.376 position:50% align:center
[IRMA]
They're exposed? Already? Jeez!

00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:26.296 position:50% align:center
Go, kid! Buy us some time!
I'll blast a way out!

00:17:26.379 --> 00:17:29.007 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO] Got it! And don't
call me "kid," please!

00:17:43.146 --> 00:17:44.689 position:50% align:center

Evidence of Mary Bult's

If I continue
researching Coldfire,

00:19:00.098 --> 00:19:02.058 position:50% align:center
I may be able to peer
into the abyss

00:19:02.142 --> 00:19:05.353 position:50% align:center
of this 'cataclysmic

Henceforth, I shall call
that the Awakening Gene.

When normal people
are exposed to the light,

00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:19.284 position:50% align:center
they develop luminosis.

However, this is not the case

their physical and magical

This occurs far
beyond normal levels.

00:19:31.588 --> 00:19:33.673 position:50% align:center
I made a discovery
about all this.

00:19:33.757 --> 00:19:35.383 position:50% align:center
Under certain conditions,

distinct from Awakening

This is it. This is the
abyss I have been seeking.

00:19:51.608 --> 00:19:54.361 position:50% align:center
One interesting side effect
is that the specimens

However, a substance
produced in their uteruses

grants them resistance
to Coldfire.

00:20:04.412 --> 00:20:07.082 position:50% align:center
I found that, when given
to a luminosis patient,

00:20:07.165 --> 00:20:10.543 position:50% align:center
the substance temporarily
halts the disease's progress.

"Show"?

Yes, I performed a
demonstration the other day.

A test of what would
happen to a world

struck by the light.

Though to be frank, the result
was quite boring, sadly.

It has come about countless
times in the past millennium,

and the cataclysmic
light shall come again!
