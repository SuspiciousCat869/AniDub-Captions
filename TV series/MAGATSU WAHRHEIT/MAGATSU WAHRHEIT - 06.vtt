00:02:09.546 --> 00:02:10.964 position:50% align:center
Hey, buddy.

00:02:11.047 --> 00:02:13.049 position:50% align:center
It seems pretty packed
around here lately.

00:02:13.133 --> 00:02:14.551 position:50% align:center
[INSPECTION OFFICER 06A]
I guess you haven't heard about

00:02:14.634 --> 00:02:17.178 position:50% align:center
the new city construction.
They're building south of here.

00:02:17.262 --> 00:02:19.264 position:50% align:center
That's what's causing
the increase in traffic,

00:02:19.347 --> 00:02:22.851 position:50% align:center
which means more crime,
sadly. Lot more work.

00:02:22.934 --> 00:02:24.853 position:50% align:center
Is this all the
cargo you've got?

00:02:24.936 --> 00:02:26.855 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir. That's all.

00:02:34.529 --> 00:02:36.906 position:50% align:center
[WORKER 01A]
Hey, all clear.

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:40.160 position:50% align:center
Thanks. You've been
such a great help, man.

00:02:40.243 --> 00:02:42.537 position:50% align:center
--I'll make it up to you--
--Shut your mouth.

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.581 position:50% align:center
I didn't do anything,
I didn't see anything,

00:02:44.664 --> 00:02:46.666 position:50% align:center
and I don't know who you are.

00:02:48.043 --> 00:02:51.254 position:50% align:center
Right. Well, uh,
guess I'd better get going.

00:02:51.338 --> 00:02:52.255 position:50% align:center
Thanks again.

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:53.590 position:50% align:center
[WORKER 01A]
Hey, wait.

00:02:53.673 --> 00:02:56.843 position:50% align:center
If you need anything else,
lemme know. So long.

00:03:01.348 --> 00:03:02.265 position:50% align:center
Let's move out.

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:06.644 position:50% align:center
Oh, right.
So, what next? Where to?

00:03:06.728 --> 00:03:09.022 position:50% align:center
We're heading over to
one of our hideouts.

00:03:09.105 --> 00:03:11.983 position:50% align:center
It's not far from the
warehouse where you worked.

00:03:12.067 --> 00:03:13.818 position:50% align:center
Oh, right.

00:03:21.701 --> 00:03:23.078 position:50% align:center
--Are you driving?
--[MAN 06B] I think so.

00:03:23.161 --> 00:03:24.662 position:50% align:center
Well, that's good.

00:03:26.164 --> 00:03:28.083 position:50% align:center
Yeah. We almost got pinched.

00:03:28.166 --> 00:03:29.876 position:50% align:center
Ain't the first time.

00:03:31.461 --> 00:03:32.754 position:50% align:center
Hey.

00:03:32.837 --> 00:03:35.674 position:50% align:center
You're Inumaru, aren'tcha?

00:03:35.757 --> 00:03:37.884 position:50% align:center
Innumael. But, yeah.

00:03:37.967 --> 00:03:40.595 position:50% align:center
I knew it! From all
the wanted posters!

00:03:40.679 --> 00:03:43.014 position:50% align:center
Ah, come on, no need
to be so on edge.

00:03:43.098 --> 00:03:46.184 position:50% align:center
I'm Irma. What's up? Oh, hey.

00:03:46.267 --> 00:03:47.811 position:50% align:center
I heard the branch
chief in Gutheil

00:03:47.894 --> 00:03:49.979 position:50% align:center
took quite a liking to you!

00:03:50.855 --> 00:03:51.898 position:50% align:center
Has anyone...

00:03:51.981 --> 00:03:53.149 position:50% align:center
[IRMA]
What?

00:03:53.233 --> 00:03:55.026 position:50% align:center
...ever told you that
you're way too friendly?

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.070 position:50% align:center
[IRMA laughs]
All the time!

00:03:57.153 --> 00:03:59.364 position:50% align:center
Hey now, come on.
Don't make that face!

00:03:59.447 --> 00:04:01.825 position:50% align:center
We're all friends
here! For real!

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.625 position:50% align:center
[FRITZ] We've lost
contact with four spies

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:12.711 position:50% align:center
in the past month alone.

00:04:12.794 --> 00:04:15.672 position:50% align:center
Two have been confirmed dead.

00:04:15.755 --> 00:04:18.508 position:50% align:center
The papers are treating
the deaths as accidents,

00:04:18.591 --> 00:04:20.802 position:50% align:center
but we all know
that's not the truth.

00:04:20.885 --> 00:04:22.721 position:50% align:center
I see two possibilities,
the Diet knows

00:04:22.804 --> 00:04:26.057 position:50% align:center
what we're up to,
or the army is onto us.

00:04:26.141 --> 00:04:27.684 position:50% align:center
Lemme get this straight.

00:04:27.767 --> 00:04:29.102 position:50% align:center
At this point,
there's no way to know

00:04:29.185 --> 00:04:31.187 position:50% align:center
if the other two
are alive or not?

00:04:31.271 --> 00:04:32.397 position:50% align:center
That's right.

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.733 position:50% align:center
And even worse,
somebody took the trouble of

00:04:34.816 --> 00:04:36.776 position:50% align:center
killing them and
orchestrating a coverup,

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.611 position:50% align:center
but we have no way
of knowing who.

00:04:38.695 --> 00:04:41.865 position:50% align:center
[MAN 06B] That's bad, but I
don't get why we're involved.

00:04:41.948 --> 00:04:44.909 position:50% align:center
Isn't this the kind of
thing we have spies for?

00:04:44.993 --> 00:04:46.411 position:50% align:center
Before they disappeared,

00:04:46.494 --> 00:04:49.039 position:50% align:center
they had secured some
invaluable intelligence

00:04:49.122 --> 00:04:51.791 position:50% align:center
about a mysterious organization

00:04:51.875 --> 00:04:54.294 position:50% align:center
or business of some kind,
I don't know.

00:04:54.377 --> 00:04:57.881 position:50% align:center
Bottom line is we desperately
need that intel.

00:04:57.964 --> 00:05:00.508 position:50% align:center
And we can't get it
if they're dead.

00:05:00.592 --> 00:05:02.761 position:50% align:center
I'm hoping you have
a plan for their rescue.

00:05:02.844 --> 00:05:04.763 position:50% align:center
[FRITZ] Well, we know
where they first infiltrated.

00:05:04.846 --> 00:05:06.348 position:50% align:center
That's something.

00:05:06.431 --> 00:05:09.768 position:50% align:center
Two places, a paper factory
in the northwest district,

00:05:09.851 --> 00:05:12.228 position:50% align:center
and a mental institution
in the northeast.

00:05:12.312 --> 00:05:14.814 position:50% align:center
Both had ceased
operations, officially.

00:05:14.898 --> 00:05:18.485 position:50% align:center
And yet, both still had people
coming and going all day long.

00:05:18.568 --> 00:05:21.404 position:50% align:center
There's obviously
something to that.

00:05:21.488 --> 00:05:23.698 position:50% align:center
You'll sneak in
and find out what.

00:05:23.782 --> 00:05:25.575 position:50% align:center
How will we do that?

00:05:25.658 --> 00:05:27.202 position:50% align:center
[FRITZ]
You'll be working in pairs.

00:05:27.285 --> 00:05:28.828 position:50% align:center
The infiltration groups
will break in

00:05:28.912 --> 00:05:30.872 position:50% align:center
and seek out our
lost comrades,

00:05:30.955 --> 00:05:33.625 position:50% align:center
and if all goes well,
extract them.

00:05:33.708 --> 00:05:35.293 position:50% align:center
You're also to gather
as much intel

00:05:35.377 --> 00:05:37.504 position:50% align:center
as the situation allows.

00:05:37.587 --> 00:05:39.047 position:50% align:center
Now onto the battle groups.

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:40.590 position:50% align:center
Your job, should the need arise,

00:05:40.674 --> 00:05:44.135 position:50% align:center
will be to keep the army busy
during the escape mission.

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:46.721 position:50% align:center
You'll be supported by
forces from another hideout.

00:05:46.805 --> 00:05:49.057 position:50% align:center
You're to operate
in concert with them.

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:50.975 position:50% align:center
Lastly, the getaway groups.

00:05:51.059 --> 00:05:54.145 position:50% align:center
After retrieving our rescued
comrades and the battle groups,

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:57.190 position:50% align:center
your job will be to withdraw
to a safe location.

00:05:57.273 --> 00:05:58.692 position:50% align:center
Comrades who are
most familiar with

00:05:58.775 --> 00:06:01.403 position:50% align:center
the capital will be
placed in these groups.

00:06:16.251 --> 00:06:18.294 position:50% align:center
Hello, welcome back.

00:06:18.378 --> 00:06:19.421 position:50% align:center
Hey, tell me.

00:06:19.504 --> 00:06:20.505 position:50% align:center
[INNUMAEL]
Tell you what?

00:06:20.588 --> 00:06:23.049 position:50% align:center
Do you think the spies
are still alive?

00:06:23.133 --> 00:06:24.634 position:50% align:center
Who knows?

00:06:24.718 --> 00:06:27.178 position:50% align:center
[IRMA] My Headkeeper activities
have been mainly in the capital,

00:06:27.262 --> 00:06:30.682 position:50% align:center
but this is my first
rescue operation.

00:06:30.765 --> 00:06:32.726 position:50% align:center
People have been
captured before.

00:06:32.809 --> 00:06:35.311 position:50% align:center
Why're we doing
a rescue mission this time?

00:06:35.395 --> 00:06:36.771 position:50% align:center
[INNUMAEL]
Dunno.

00:06:36.855 --> 00:06:38.565 position:50% align:center
I'm not even really a member
of Headkeeper or anything.

00:06:38.648 --> 00:06:41.067 position:50% align:center
If you're not a member,
then how come you're here?

00:06:41.151 --> 00:06:42.485 position:50% align:center
Because...

00:06:44.112 --> 00:06:47.449 position:50% align:center
So, um, do you mind
if I ask you why?

00:06:47.532 --> 00:06:50.535 position:50% align:center
My little sister has luminosis.

00:06:50.618 --> 00:06:53.621 position:50% align:center
It's terminal.
She won't make it.

00:06:53.705 --> 00:06:54.789 position:50% align:center
Oh.

00:06:54.873 --> 00:06:55.999 position:50% align:center
[KLAUS]
In my town,

00:06:56.082 --> 00:06:58.960 position:50% align:center
the number of luminosis
cases grew steadily.

00:06:59.044 --> 00:07:02.005 position:50% align:center
Back then we had no clue.

00:07:02.088 --> 00:07:04.215 position:50% align:center
We didn't know what was
causing it to spread.

00:07:04.299 --> 00:07:06.760 position:50% align:center
We begged the Empire
to investigate,

00:07:06.843 --> 00:07:08.970 position:50% align:center
but they just
sat on their hands.

00:07:09.054 --> 00:07:12.390 position:50% align:center
By the time the Diet
got off their fat asses,

00:07:12.474 --> 00:07:14.351 position:50% align:center
it was too late.

00:07:14.434 --> 00:07:15.560 position:50% align:center
What was it?

00:07:15.643 --> 00:07:17.020 position:50% align:center
The underground water
supply had been

00:07:17.103 --> 00:07:19.564 position:50% align:center
contaminated by Coldfire.

00:07:19.647 --> 00:07:22.233 position:50% align:center
In the end, most of the
people there got luminosis.

00:07:22.317 --> 00:07:24.402 position:50% align:center
The town was abandoned.

00:07:24.486 --> 00:07:26.029 position:50% align:center
Little sister...

00:07:26.112 --> 00:07:28.531 position:50% align:center
Hey, what are you brooding
about over there?

00:07:28.615 --> 00:07:31.117 position:50% align:center
Uh-- That's none
of your business.

00:07:31.201 --> 00:07:34.496 position:50% align:center
Why is someone like--ahem.
Nothing, never mind.

00:07:34.579 --> 00:07:37.040 position:50% align:center
So, why did you
join Headkeeper, Irma?

00:07:37.123 --> 00:07:37.916 position:50% align:center
You wanna know?

00:07:37.999 --> 00:07:39.417 position:50% align:center
No, not really.

00:07:39.501 --> 00:07:42.212 position:50% align:center
Oops, I did it again, I made
a man curious about my past!

00:07:42.295 --> 00:07:43.546 position:50% align:center
What a naughty,
scandalous woman I am!

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:44.964 position:50% align:center
More like annoying woman.

00:07:45.048 --> 00:07:48.259 position:50% align:center
But it's perfectly normal
you'd be fascinated by me.

00:07:48.343 --> 00:07:49.969 position:50% align:center
Very well, then, I'll tell you.

00:07:50.053 --> 00:07:51.638 position:50% align:center
You see, I have noble blood!

00:07:51.721 --> 00:07:52.931 position:50% align:center
I have an unmistakable,

00:07:53.014 --> 00:07:54.391 position:50% align:center
aristocratic air
about me, right?

00:07:54.474 --> 00:07:56.226 position:50% align:center
[INNUMAEL]
It's him.

00:07:58.395 --> 00:08:00.814 position:50% align:center
[INNUMAEL]
Why isn't he in uniform?

00:08:00.897 --> 00:08:03.441 position:50% align:center
It's too early for him
to be off work.

00:08:03.525 --> 00:08:04.818 position:50% align:center
But that's not all!

00:08:04.901 --> 00:08:07.946 position:50% align:center
[INNUMAEL] Hey, one sec.
You hold down the fort.

00:08:08.029 --> 00:08:10.448 position:50% align:center
Uh, wait here.
I'll be right back.

00:08:10.532 --> 00:08:12.117 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:08:15.036 --> 00:08:17.038 position:50% align:center
I knew it, that is him.

00:08:20.291 --> 00:08:23.128 position:50% align:center
[INNUMAEL] That
Leo-something-something guy.

00:08:23.211 --> 00:08:25.130 position:50% align:center
Hey, Faust!

00:08:25.213 --> 00:08:26.423 position:50% align:center
Oh hi, Leo.

00:08:26.506 --> 00:08:27.799 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO]
Headed home?

00:08:27.882 --> 00:08:29.718 position:50% align:center
[FAUST] Mm-hm. The whole lab
has maintenance today,

00:08:29.801 --> 00:08:31.678 position:50% align:center
so I left early.

00:08:31.761 --> 00:08:33.346 position:50% align:center
I figured I would
catch up on some reading.

00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:34.931 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:08:35.015 --> 00:08:36.349 position:50% align:center
[CONRAD]
Friend of yours?

00:08:36.433 --> 00:08:39.686 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO] Huh? Well, yes,
but he's also a neighbor.

00:08:39.769 --> 00:08:40.937 position:50% align:center
I'm Faust.

00:08:41.021 --> 00:08:42.272 position:50% align:center
Name's Conrad.

00:08:42.355 --> 00:08:45.191 position:50% align:center
And Leo forgot to mention
I'm his senior at work.

00:08:45.275 --> 00:08:46.526 position:50% align:center
[FAUST]
Military, huh?

00:08:46.609 --> 00:08:49.320 position:50% align:center
[CONRAD] That's right.
You a doctor or something?

00:08:49.404 --> 00:08:51.781 position:50% align:center
Not exactly, but not far off.

00:08:51.865 --> 00:08:53.950 position:50% align:center
I work in pharmaceutical
development.

00:08:54.034 --> 00:08:56.036 position:50% align:center
Like, drugs? What kind?

00:08:56.119 --> 00:08:57.996 position:50% align:center
[FAUST]
For luminosis, primarily.

00:08:58.079 --> 00:09:00.123 position:50% align:center
I can't talk details, though.

00:09:00.206 --> 00:09:02.375 position:50% align:center
Luminosis?

00:09:02.459 --> 00:09:03.543 position:50% align:center
[CONRAD]
Not like us, huh?

00:09:03.626 --> 00:09:05.462 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO]
Hey, speak for yourself.

00:09:13.511 --> 00:09:15.096 position:50% align:center
I find it a little
bit unsettling

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:17.057 position:50% align:center
that this place is so empty.

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:19.601 position:50% align:center
Yeah, makes me wonder
if we're in the right spot.

00:09:19.684 --> 00:09:22.562 position:50% align:center
I mean, there doesn't seem to be
anybody around here at all.

00:09:22.645 --> 00:09:24.939 position:50% align:center
Do you think we may
have gotten bad intel?

00:09:25.023 --> 00:09:26.858 position:50% align:center
Let's wrap it up and get out--

00:09:40.914 --> 00:09:42.457 position:50% align:center
Guess there is someone here.

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:43.583 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:09:43.667 --> 00:09:45.710 position:50% align:center
I kinda have a bad
feeling about this.

00:09:45.794 --> 00:09:49.130 position:50% align:center
I'd be worried if you had a good
feeling in this situation.

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:51.633 position:50% align:center
[CONRAD]
Brothers!

00:09:51.716 --> 00:09:52.884 position:50% align:center
--[SQUAD MEMBER 06B] Yo.
--[SQUAD MEMBER 06A] Hey.

00:09:52.967 --> 00:09:54.052 position:50% align:center
[CONRAD] We should go
grab a drink after this.

00:09:54.135 --> 00:09:56.096 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO]
Don't be ridiculous, Conrad.

00:09:56.179 --> 00:09:57.555 position:50% align:center
[SQUAD MEMBER 06B]
How're things on your end?

00:09:57.639 --> 00:09:58.723 position:50% align:center
[CONRAD]
I'm hungry.

00:09:58.807 --> 00:10:00.058 position:50% align:center
[SQUAD MEMBER 06B]
That's not what I meant.

00:10:00.141 --> 00:10:01.976 position:50% align:center
[CONRAD]
Eh, nothing really stands out.

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:07.357 position:50% align:center
I see. Same for us. This whole
thing is so crazy, man.

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:08.608 position:50% align:center
How are we supposed to patrol

00:10:08.692 --> 00:10:10.860 position:50% align:center
for people that
we can't recognize?

00:10:10.944 --> 00:10:12.362 position:50% align:center
Yeah, seems odd.

00:10:12.445 --> 00:10:14.989 position:50% align:center
The thing is, this case has
four squads assigned to it,

00:10:15.073 --> 00:10:16.157 position:50% align:center
which to me would indicate that

00:10:16.241 --> 00:10:18.368 position:50% align:center
this info does have
some credibility.

00:10:18.451 --> 00:10:20.870 position:50% align:center
Yes. And security
has been limited

00:10:20.954 --> 00:10:23.707 position:50% align:center
to the northwest and
northeast districts.

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:27.377 position:50% align:center
That also leads me to believe
they have some concrete intel.

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:29.087 position:50% align:center
What's more,
I heard it was the Diet

00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:31.131 position:50% align:center
that requested our mobilization.

00:10:31.214 --> 00:10:33.425 position:50% align:center
So, do you really think
it's gonna happen?

00:10:33.508 --> 00:10:36.052 position:50% align:center
That there'll be a
Headkeeper raid today?

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:39.097 position:50% align:center
--Leo.
--Yeah.

00:10:44.644 --> 00:10:46.062 position:50% align:center
[CONRAD]
See anything?

00:10:49.524 --> 00:10:52.819 position:50% align:center
[IRMA] Fold under pressure,
and stifle that monstrous yawn.

00:10:52.902 --> 00:10:54.487 position:50% align:center
You're waiting in vain.

00:10:54.571 --> 00:11:00.243 position:50% align:center
Voila! Crane-- You startled me!

00:11:00.326 --> 00:11:03.246 position:50% align:center
Welcome back. Inumaru?

00:11:03.329 --> 00:11:04.706 position:50% align:center
[INNUMAEL]
They're onto us!

00:11:04.789 --> 00:11:05.874 position:50% align:center
[IRMA]
Huh?

00:11:05.957 --> 00:11:07.292 position:50% align:center
They're onto us!

00:11:07.375 --> 00:11:09.169 position:50% align:center
They know we're doing something
in the capital today!

00:11:09.252 --> 00:11:10.879 position:50% align:center
Is that true? But how?

00:11:10.962 --> 00:11:14.007 position:50% align:center
Why would I know?
Plain clothes soldiers--

00:11:26.186 --> 00:11:28.063 position:50% align:center
[INNUMAEL]
Is he gone?

00:11:28.146 --> 00:11:31.274 position:50% align:center
Uh... Think so. Who is he?

00:11:31.358 --> 00:11:32.942 position:50% align:center
[INNUMAEL]
Imperial military.

00:11:33.026 --> 00:11:34.444 position:50% align:center
How do you know that?

00:11:34.527 --> 00:11:36.196 position:50% align:center
[INNUMAEL]
I just do, okay?

00:11:36.279 --> 00:11:38.490 position:50% align:center
Listen, I need you to go
to the hideout right now

00:11:38.573 --> 00:11:40.658 position:50% align:center
and tell them to call
the whole thing off.

00:11:40.742 --> 00:11:41.826 position:50% align:center
[IRMA]
But what'll you do?

00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:45.747 position:50% align:center
Who, me? Well, I—I, uh--

00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:52.837 position:50% align:center
Huh, so you both
spotted him, then.

00:11:52.921 --> 00:11:54.089 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir.

00:11:54.172 --> 00:11:56.633 position:50% align:center
We were only able to get
a brief look, but still.

00:11:56.716 --> 00:12:00.679 position:50% align:center
It was him, the guy we let
escape before. Innumael.

00:12:00.762 --> 00:12:03.014 position:50% align:center
Conrad is out there
tailing him now.

00:12:03.098 --> 00:12:05.141 position:50% align:center
Once we find their hideout
it's only a matter of--

00:12:05.225 --> 00:12:07.644 position:50% align:center
[HELMAN] Why don't you
bring the car around.

00:12:07.727 --> 00:12:09.479 position:50% align:center
We can help Conrad find him.

00:12:09.562 --> 00:12:12.982 position:50% align:center
Uh-- Then, shall I send
a message to the other squads?

00:12:13.066 --> 00:12:15.735 position:50% align:center
Nah, I think it'll be
better with just us.

00:12:15.819 --> 00:12:18.988 position:50% align:center
Huh? Understood, sir.

00:12:40.802 --> 00:12:43.054 position:50% align:center
He knew we were tailing him!

00:12:46.433 --> 00:12:49.853 position:50% align:center
Huh? Hey, whoa! What the--
How'd you get in here?

00:12:51.146 --> 00:12:53.023 position:50% align:center
Ugh. Now he's hiding?

00:12:53.106 --> 00:12:56.651 position:50% align:center
And he picked the most
annoying place do it, too.

00:12:56.735 --> 00:12:58.153 position:50% align:center
--You, there.
--[WORKER 01A] Yeah?

00:12:58.236 --> 00:12:59.487 position:50% align:center
[SQUAD MEMBER 06B] A man just
came running through here

00:12:59.571 --> 00:13:02.115 position:50% align:center

Which way'd he go?

00:13:02.198 --> 00:13:05.493 position:50% align:center
[WORKER 01A] Yeah, I'm pretty
sure he ran back there.

00:13:05.577 --> 00:13:06.661 position:50% align:center
[CONRAD]
We should split up.

00:13:06.745 --> 00:13:08.246 position:50% align:center
[SQUAD MEMBER 06B]
Guess so.

00:13:15.628 --> 00:13:17.380 position:50% align:center
They're gone now.

00:13:18.715 --> 00:13:21.051 position:50% align:center

Way, way too close!

00:13:21.134 --> 00:13:22.344 position:50% align:center
Sure was.

00:13:22.427 --> 00:13:24.804 position:50% align:center
Ah, for the love of--
it's you again?

00:13:24.888 --> 00:13:27.932 position:50% align:center

keep happening to me?

00:13:38.109 --> 00:13:39.402 position:50% align:center

What do you see?

00:13:39.486 --> 00:13:41.613 position:50% align:center

but the same guy.

Isn't that perfect for us?

Damn right. It is.

00:14:08.807 --> 00:14:11.976 position:50% align:center
This doesn't look at all like it
used to be a mental institution.

00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:14.854 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I know I'd never
want to be a patient here.

it never comes down to that.

what d'you think

00:14:24.155 --> 00:14:25.907 position:50% align:center
in a place like this?

No, really. What'd you mean?

00:19:32.088 --> 00:19:33.673 position:50% align:center
[INNUMAEL]
Here goes.

00:19:36.343 --> 00:19:39.054 position:50% align:center
[INNUMAEL]
That seems careless of them.

00:19:39.137 --> 00:19:42.682 position:50% align:center
Well, pardon me but
I'm letting myself in.

00:19:50.315 --> 00:19:52.150 position:50% align:center
What in the hell?

00:19:52.233 --> 00:19:54.944 position:50% align:center
What in the world happened here?

00:20:11.628 --> 00:20:13.505 position:50% align:center
[INNUMAEL]
What is that?

00:20:27.143 --> 00:20:28.978 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:41.157 --> 00:20:42.742 position:50% align:center
[BENJAMIN]
Can you lift your arm?

00:20:42.826 --> 00:20:45.537 position:50% align:center
[ARNOLT] I'm fine.
It's just a body blow.

00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:47.330 position:50% align:center
Nothing serious.

00:20:47.414 --> 00:20:50.125 position:50% align:center
[BENJAMIN] The bone. I think
it might be fractured.

00:20:50.208 --> 00:20:53.336 position:50% align:center
[ARNOLT] I'll be able to move in
a sec, just need a little rest.

00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:56.089 position:50% align:center
[BENJAMIN] Are you sure?
You need to be more careful!

00:20:56.172 --> 00:20:57.173 position:50% align:center
[ARNOLT]
Cut me some slack.

00:20:57.257 --> 00:20:58.925 position:50% align:center
[INNUMAEL]
Someone's still in here?

00:20:59.009 --> 00:21:00.719 position:50% align:center
[BENJAMIN] You're not
getting any younger.

00:21:00.802 --> 00:21:02.303 position:50% align:center
[ARNOLT]
Hey! I'm not that old!

00:21:02.387 --> 00:21:04.597 position:50% align:center
[BENJAMIN chuckles]
Very funny.

00:21:04.681 --> 00:21:06.433 position:50% align:center
[ARNOLT]
What's so funny, huh?

00:21:06.516 --> 00:21:09.144 position:50% align:center
[BENJAMIN]
Uh, nothing. Anyway.

00:21:11.771 --> 00:21:15.316 position:50% align:center
Wait! Don't shoot! It's me! Ben!

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:17.527 position:50% align:center
Arnolt? Benjamin?

00:21:17.610 --> 00:21:19.362 position:50% align:center
[BENJAMIN, INNUMAEL sigh]

00:21:22.949 --> 00:21:24.743 position:50% align:center
What are you even doing here?

00:21:24.826 --> 00:21:27.704 position:50% align:center
The Imperial army knew
all about the operation!

00:21:27.787 --> 00:21:29.247 position:50% align:center
The whole thing was a trap!

00:21:29.330 --> 00:21:31.124 position:50% align:center
What the-- But why?

00:21:31.207 --> 00:21:32.959 position:50% align:center
How in the heck would I know?

00:21:33.043 --> 00:21:34.878 position:50% align:center
But we've got bigger
problems than that!

00:21:34.961 --> 00:21:38.006 position:50% align:center
The city is being attacked
by monsters on a rampage!

00:21:38.089 --> 00:21:39.549 position:50% align:center
I don't know what's going on.

00:21:39.632 --> 00:21:42.135 position:50% align:center
I just passed one of them, too.

00:21:42.218 --> 00:21:45.638 position:50% align:center
The monsters attacking the city,
they came from here.

00:21:45.722 --> 00:21:46.931 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:21:47.015 --> 00:21:49.601 position:50% align:center
They were being cultivated
in this strange lab.

00:21:49.684 --> 00:21:51.686 position:50% align:center
[INNUMAEL]
Wait, cultivated?

00:21:51.770 --> 00:21:54.481 position:50% align:center
[ARNOLT] They were in
all those broken capsules.

00:21:54.564 --> 00:21:57.067 position:50% align:center
Then all of a sudden,
they woke up.

00:21:57.150 --> 00:22:00.278 position:50% align:center
[INNUMAEL]
Huh? Wait, what do you mean?

00:22:00.362 --> 00:22:03.031 position:50% align:center
Like on a farm or something?

00:22:03.114 --> 00:22:06.284 position:50% align:center
For now, the three
of us need to escape.

00:22:06.368 --> 00:22:08.328 position:50% align:center
What about the rescue?

00:22:08.411 --> 00:22:10.455 position:50% align:center
Wait! Be quiet.

00:22:24.010 --> 00:22:26.137 position:50% align:center
That's the one I passed.

00:22:27.472 --> 00:22:29.641 position:50% align:center
[ARNOLT]
That's Elfriede.

00:22:30.684 --> 00:22:32.018 position:50% align:center
[INNUMAEL]
You mean--?
