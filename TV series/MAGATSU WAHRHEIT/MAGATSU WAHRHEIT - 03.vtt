00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:40.874 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO]
It's Leocadio.

00:00:40.957 --> 00:00:43.043 position:50% align:center
[HELMAN]
It's open. Come in.

00:00:44.627 --> 00:00:46.087 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO]
You summoned me, sir?

00:00:46.171 --> 00:00:50.300 position:50% align:center
Yes. We have to make our way
back to the capital tomorrow.

00:00:50.383 --> 00:00:52.886 position:50% align:center
And so, I'd like to give you
an independent assignment.

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:56.473 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir. Who is this?

00:00:56.556 --> 00:00:59.642 position:50% align:center
[HELMAN] Someone who I'd like
you to bring into the capital.

00:00:59.726 --> 00:01:02.854 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO]
Bring her in? But who is she?

00:01:02.937 --> 00:01:06.649 position:50% align:center
Did I say you needed to
know that information?

00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:08.902 position:50% align:center
No. Apologies, sir.

00:01:08.985 --> 00:01:11.196 position:50% align:center
There's no need
to apologize, Leo.

00:01:11.279 --> 00:01:13.073 position:50% align:center
The girl is Innumael's
younger sister.

00:01:13.156 --> 00:01:14.199 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:01:36.971 --> 00:01:38.390 position:50% align:center
--Hey.
--What now?

00:01:38.473 --> 00:01:40.266 position:50% align:center
Just curious where we're headed.

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.518 position:50% align:center
The Gutheil Domain.

00:01:41.601 --> 00:01:44.437 position:50% align:center
[INNUMAEL gasps]
That's a pretty big city, right?

00:01:44.521 --> 00:01:45.897 position:50% align:center
Why are we going there?

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:47.774 position:50% align:center
It was our original destination.

00:01:47.857 --> 00:01:50.151 position:50% align:center
I'm on wanted posters
all over the place,

00:01:50.235 --> 00:01:53.029 position:50% align:center
so I'd prefer to avoid
cities with lots of people.

00:01:53.113 --> 00:01:55.365 position:50% align:center
We could always let you
out here if you want.

00:01:55.448 --> 00:01:57.242 position:50% align:center
[SCHAAKE]
Be quiet.

00:01:57.325 --> 00:01:59.160 position:50% align:center
Gutheil's a summer
vacation spot,

00:01:59.244 --> 00:02:01.204 position:50% align:center
which brings nobles.

00:02:01.287 --> 00:02:03.039 position:50% align:center
Wait, nobles?

00:02:03.123 --> 00:02:04.541 position:50% align:center
[ARNOLT] ...but that we
have financial backers

00:02:04.624 --> 00:02:06.042 position:50% align:center
in the area, too.

00:02:06.126 --> 00:02:07.544 position:50% align:center
Do you really think
we could smuggle weapons

00:02:07.627 --> 00:02:09.587 position:50% align:center
with only commoners backing us?

00:02:09.671 --> 00:02:11.715 position:50% align:center
[INNUMAEL]
So, then the nobles are--

00:02:11.798 --> 00:02:13.466 position:50% align:center
And, get this.
Schaake's family--

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:14.843 position:50% align:center
Enough.

00:02:19.514 --> 00:02:20.390 position:50% align:center
What's wrong?

00:02:20.473 --> 00:02:21.224 position:50% align:center
[INNUMAEL]
Hey! What happened?

00:02:21.307 --> 00:02:22.559 position:50% align:center
Look there.

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:56.009 position:50% align:center
Oh. Just some guy. Is he okay?

00:03:01.222 --> 00:03:02.932 position:50% align:center
The guy's stomach's
been split open,

00:03:03.016 --> 00:03:07.979 position:50% align:center
but doesn't look like anything
has fed on him. Huh? Look.

00:03:10.982 --> 00:03:14.652 position:50% align:center
What the hell's going on here?

00:04:50.623 --> 00:04:52.542 position:50% align:center
--[FRITZ] Well?
--I found it.

00:04:52.625 --> 00:04:55.754 position:50% align:center
Organization funds were flowing
right to a Diet member.

00:04:55.837 --> 00:04:57.172 position:50% align:center
[FRITZ]
As I suspected.

00:04:57.255 --> 00:04:59.090 position:50% align:center
We have a traitor in our midst.

00:04:59.174 --> 00:05:00.300 position:50% align:center
Where'd you get the intel?

00:05:00.383 --> 00:05:04.220 position:50% align:center
[ELFRIEDE gasps]
From a reliable source.

00:05:04.304 --> 00:05:07.098 position:50% align:center
No matter. Who received
funds in the Diet?

00:05:07.182 --> 00:05:08.600 position:50% align:center
[ELFRIEDE]
I don't know yet.

00:05:08.683 --> 00:05:10.769 position:50% align:center
While that matters,
what's of greater interest

00:05:10.852 --> 00:05:12.937 position:50% align:center
is where the money's going.

00:05:16.066 --> 00:05:17.567 position:50% align:center
Elaborate, please.

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:20.111 position:50% align:center
[ELFRIEDE] Funds are flowing
to the Ministry of Energy,

00:05:20.195 --> 00:05:22.364 position:50% align:center
and it's deftly concealed.

00:05:22.447 --> 00:05:24.366 position:50% align:center
Yes, what's so
strange about that?

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:27.202 position:50% align:center
[ELFRIEDE] That agency is
under the Emperor's control.

00:05:27.285 --> 00:05:29.079 position:50% align:center
The Diet can't
direct capital there

00:05:29.162 --> 00:05:31.664 position:50% align:center
without the Emperor's
recognition.

00:05:31.748 --> 00:05:33.041 position:50% align:center
[FRITZ]
That's true.

00:05:33.124 --> 00:05:35.669 position:50% align:center
[ELFRIEDE] Regardless,
if we just follow the money,

00:05:35.752 --> 00:05:38.213 position:50% align:center
we may find a connection
to the traitor.

00:05:38.296 --> 00:05:40.256 position:50% align:center
[FRITZ]
Continue your investigation.

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:44.469 position:50% align:center
The flow of funds, the Diet,
what it's for, all of it. Also--

00:05:44.552 --> 00:05:47.180 position:50% align:center
We've lost all contact
with our other spies.

00:05:47.263 --> 00:05:51.267 position:50% align:center
It's definitely not the
usual silence. Be careful.

00:05:52.936 --> 00:05:55.980 position:50% align:center
Would it kill him to tell me
I'm doing a good job?

00:05:59.317 --> 00:06:01.236 position:50% align:center
Would you stop
tapping your foot?

00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:04.614 position:50% align:center
Oh. How can you be so calm,
after seeing something so awful?

00:06:04.698 --> 00:06:06.032 position:50% align:center
It's no big deal.

00:06:06.116 --> 00:06:09.202 position:50% align:center
Our organization was originally
made to fight monsters.

00:06:09.285 --> 00:06:12.372 position:50% align:center
We don't just smuggle
and sell weapons, you know.

00:06:12.455 --> 00:06:16.001 position:50% align:center
I don't remember asking about
your organization's activities.

00:06:16.084 --> 00:06:17.293 position:50% align:center
I'm surprised.

00:06:17.377 --> 00:06:19.713 position:50% align:center
It's not often that we
see this many casualties.

00:06:19.796 --> 00:06:21.047 position:50% align:center
What monster did that?

00:06:21.131 --> 00:06:23.925 position:50% align:center
None of them showed
any signs of being fed upon,

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:24.926 position:50% align:center
even though some of them were

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:28.138 position:50% align:center
killed several
days ago, at least.

00:06:28.221 --> 00:06:30.015 position:50% align:center
Can we talk about
something else?

00:06:30.098 --> 00:06:31.975 position:50% align:center
There might be some
blood-thirsty monster

00:06:32.058 --> 00:06:34.436 position:50% align:center
prowling in this
very forest as we speak!

00:06:34.519 --> 00:06:37.397 position:50% align:center
Uh, hey. Why don't
we take a detour?

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.149 position:50% align:center
If we dilly-dally here,
the army might find us!

00:06:39.232 --> 00:06:41.526 position:50% align:center
I mean, that's the whole reason
we're here to begin with.

00:06:41.609 --> 00:06:43.236 position:50% align:center
Wait, just what do you mean?

00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:46.239 position:50% align:center
[KLAUS] Altar Forest is outside
the army's jurisdiction,

00:06:46.322 --> 00:06:49.034 position:50% align:center
but I wouldn't mind taking
a highway instead.

00:06:49.117 --> 00:06:52.746 position:50% align:center
I mean, you're the only one
of us they'd recognize.

00:06:52.829 --> 00:06:54.456 position:50% align:center
[INNUMAEL]
What a jerk.

00:06:55.498 --> 00:06:58.835 position:50% align:center
It looks like we might need
a couple of replacement parts.

00:06:58.918 --> 00:07:00.962 position:50% align:center
What are we
supposed to do, walk?

00:07:01.046 --> 00:07:02.964 position:50% align:center
The Gutheil Domain's
way too far.

00:07:03.048 --> 00:07:05.550 position:50% align:center
There's a village
a few kilometers ahead.

00:07:05.633 --> 00:07:11.097 position:50% align:center
Schaake and Ben, go see if they
can spare some parts for us.

00:07:11.181 --> 00:07:12.140 position:50% align:center
We'll stay and
guard the vehicle.

00:07:12.223 --> 00:07:14.726 position:50% align:center
What? As in,
we're gonna stay here?

00:07:14.809 --> 00:07:16.019 position:50% align:center
[ARNOLT]
That's right.

00:07:16.102 --> 00:07:18.355 position:50% align:center
But you can go with them,
if you want, Innumael.

00:07:18.438 --> 00:07:20.106 position:50% align:center
We'll probably have to make
camp here for the night.

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:26.905 position:50% align:center
Uh... Yeah, I think
I will go. [chuckles]

00:07:32.369 --> 00:07:34.079 position:50% align:center
Oh, finally.

00:07:34.162 --> 00:07:35.789 position:50% align:center
Are we gonna stay the night?

00:07:35.872 --> 00:07:37.248 position:50% align:center
I think we should.

00:07:37.332 --> 00:07:38.583 position:50% align:center
Yes, you're right.

00:07:38.667 --> 00:07:40.001 position:50% align:center
Even if we get the parts,

00:07:40.085 --> 00:07:42.921 position:50% align:center
it'd be too dangerous
to go back in the dark.

00:07:43.838 --> 00:07:45.882 position:50% align:center
No way around it, then.

00:07:51.012 --> 00:07:52.347 position:50% align:center
Hanoi, we can't.

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:54.683 position:50% align:center
Not when the first group
still hasn't returned. Please!

00:07:54.766 --> 00:07:56.059 position:50% align:center
Should I just wait here, then?

00:07:56.142 --> 00:07:57.686 position:50% align:center
We should at least
wait until dawn

00:07:57.769 --> 00:08:00.313 position:50% align:center
to send out a search party.
It's just common sense.

00:08:00.397 --> 00:08:02.649 position:50% align:center
Why don't we just
seek aid from the military?

00:08:02.732 --> 00:08:04.401 position:50% align:center
It's all too much for us.

00:08:04.484 --> 00:08:05.694 position:50% align:center
[VILLAGE ELDER 03A]
Absolutely not!

00:08:05.777 --> 00:08:08.321 position:50% align:center
Have you forgotten
what happened ten years ago?

00:08:08.405 --> 00:08:10.281 position:50% align:center
No, I--

00:08:10.365 --> 00:08:11.825 position:50% align:center
[VILLAGER 03A]
Right.

00:08:11.908 --> 00:08:13.076 position:50% align:center
Besides, even if they came,

00:08:13.159 --> 00:08:15.912 position:50% align:center
they wouldn't get here
for several weeks.

00:08:15.995 --> 00:08:18.581 position:50% align:center
Hanoi, I understand
how you feel,

00:08:18.665 --> 00:08:20.625 position:50% align:center
but wait until morning.

00:08:20.709 --> 00:08:22.836 position:50% align:center
Anything could happen right now.

00:08:22.919 --> 00:08:24.879 position:50% align:center
In this darkness,
we'd need a search party

00:08:24.963 --> 00:08:26.256 position:50% align:center
for the search party.

00:08:26.339 --> 00:08:28.842 position:50% align:center
I don't want to cause
the village anymore trouble,

00:08:28.925 --> 00:08:30.885 position:50% align:center
so I'll go it alone.

00:08:32.303 --> 00:08:35.473 position:50% align:center
Who the hell are you?
State your names!

00:08:35.557 --> 00:08:37.058 position:50% align:center
Pardon! You see,

00:08:37.142 --> 00:08:39.394 position:50% align:center
our car broke down
in the forest near here,

00:08:39.477 --> 00:08:42.188 position:50% align:center
so we hoped you could
spare some parts,

00:08:42.272 --> 00:08:44.733 position:50% align:center
and if possible,
that we might stay the night.

00:08:44.816 --> 00:08:47.360 position:50% align:center
At this late in the evening?

00:08:47.444 --> 00:08:50.030 position:50% align:center
That'd be no trouble at all.

00:08:50.113 --> 00:08:52.323 position:50% align:center
But tell us, on your way here,

00:08:52.407 --> 00:08:54.492 position:50% align:center
did you all pass
anyone else on the road?

00:08:54.576 --> 00:08:58.997 position:50% align:center
Hey, um, what happened to
you guys? You all seem sorta--

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:01.082 position:50% align:center
Just answer the question.

00:09:03.752 --> 00:09:04.919 position:50% align:center
[SCHAAKE]
Yes, we did.

00:09:05.003 --> 00:09:06.629 position:50% align:center
We passed an area
littered with bodies.

00:09:06.713 --> 00:09:08.256 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:09:09.174 --> 00:09:11.051 position:50% align:center
Did you happen to see
any children out there?

00:09:11.134 --> 00:09:12.969 position:50% align:center
Little girls, around
the age of five or ten?

00:09:13.053 --> 00:09:14.220 position:50% align:center
[SCHAAKE]
Um. No.

00:09:14.304 --> 00:09:15.472 position:50% align:center
The fog was too thick.

00:09:15.555 --> 00:09:16.848 position:50% align:center
We weren't able
to look at them all.

00:09:16.931 --> 00:09:19.351 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, but you
need to take me there.

00:09:19.434 --> 00:09:21.603 position:50% align:center
Look, I get it, but we
just got here, and it's--

00:09:21.686 --> 00:09:24.105 position:50% align:center
So, your grandkid?

00:09:24.189 --> 00:09:26.399 position:50% align:center
Yes, that's right.

00:09:26.483 --> 00:09:29.319 position:50% align:center
[SCHAAKE]
Well. Let's head back.

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:33.573 position:50% align:center
[BENJAMIN sighs]
There's no way around it.

00:09:33.656 --> 00:09:35.075 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:09:38.787 --> 00:09:40.205 position:50% align:center
Hey, did you find her?

00:09:40.288 --> 00:09:43.083 position:50% align:center
She's not here. Where is Arn?

00:09:43.166 --> 00:09:44.668 position:50% align:center
[KLAUS]
Guard duty.

00:09:44.751 --> 00:09:47.587 position:50% align:center
This mission's been nothing
but trouble from the start.

00:09:47.671 --> 00:09:49.422 position:50% align:center
[BENJAMIN]
Uh-huh. Will you help me search?

00:09:49.506 --> 00:09:51.049 position:50% align:center
[KLAUS]
Yeah, I guess.

00:09:52.217 --> 00:09:54.135 position:50% align:center
She isn't here.

00:09:59.224 --> 00:10:01.976 position:50% align:center
So, what's living in
this forest anyway?

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:03.520 position:50% align:center
You're all spooked.

00:10:03.603 --> 00:10:06.815 position:50% align:center
My granddaughter, Dejrelle,
hasn't come home for two days.

00:10:06.898 --> 00:10:10.527 position:50% align:center
[SCHAAKE] I see. I'm sorry.
I'd be spooked, too.

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:13.863 position:50% align:center
[HANOI] And then today, I turned
my back for just a second,

00:10:13.947 --> 00:10:16.574 position:50% align:center
and her little sister, Yasmin,
went to look for her.

00:10:16.658 --> 00:10:18.743 position:50% align:center
Yasmin hasn't been
seen since, either.

00:10:18.827 --> 00:10:20.328 position:50% align:center
Wait, both?

00:10:23.748 --> 00:10:26.918 position:50% align:center
And the thing that attacked
these folks. What is it?

00:10:27.002 --> 00:10:29.379 position:50% align:center
Sorry, but I wish I knew.

00:10:29.462 --> 00:10:31.923 position:50% align:center
Nobody in the village
has ever seen the thing.

00:10:32.007 --> 00:10:35.385 position:50% align:center
Haven't you at least come up
with a hypothesis, old man?

00:10:36.386 --> 00:10:38.054 position:50% align:center
It was a few days back.

00:10:38.138 --> 00:10:41.099 position:50% align:center
Lightning struck in the forest.
It wasn't even raining.

00:10:41.182 --> 00:10:44.269 position:50% align:center
I don't think it was
particularly cloudy, either.

00:10:44.352 --> 00:10:47.147 position:50% align:center
The next day, some villagers
went to check it out,

00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:50.358 position:50% align:center
and every one of them returned,
without incident.

00:10:50.442 --> 00:10:52.068 position:50% align:center
But after that,
people who went out into

00:10:52.152 --> 00:10:54.487 position:50% align:center
the forest to hunt
started going missing.

00:10:54.571 --> 00:10:55.989 position:50% align:center
So, then the lightning.

00:10:56.072 --> 00:10:58.283 position:50% align:center
What does it have to do
with the disappearances?

00:10:58.366 --> 00:10:59.743 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure.

00:10:59.826 --> 00:11:02.912 position:50% align:center
I didn't think much of it,
so I didn't get the details.

00:11:02.996 --> 00:11:05.957 position:50% align:center
But the others,
they might know more about it.

00:11:06.041 --> 00:11:07.459 position:50% align:center
Regardless, the bodies here

00:11:07.542 --> 00:11:09.544 position:50% align:center
still don't account for
all of the missing.

00:11:09.627 --> 00:11:11.880 position:50% align:center
Uh, hang on a sec.

00:11:11.963 --> 00:11:13.048 position:50% align:center
I don't get the lightning,

00:11:13.131 --> 00:11:15.050 position:50% align:center
but there's definitely
a monster, right?

00:11:15.133 --> 00:11:17.302 position:50% align:center
We shouldn't be
poking around here.

00:11:17.385 --> 00:11:19.054 position:50% align:center
Fine, stay here alone.

00:11:19.137 --> 00:11:22.932 position:50% align:center
No, I-- Look, can we
at least wait until morning?

00:11:23.016 --> 00:11:24.434 position:50% align:center
I mean, they're probably
all dead anyway.

--Ow...
--We'd better split up.

00:11:31.274 --> 00:11:33.610 position:50% align:center

in with the village.

the old man search.

00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:38.490 position:50% align:center

Right, let's head out.

[VILLAGE ELDER 03A]
I'm sorry, but you'll have to

00:12:08.019 --> 00:12:09.604 position:50% align:center
wait until it's light.

00:12:09.688 --> 00:12:13.066 position:50% align:center

Maybe somewhere they played?

I wish I had more to say,

00:12:18.321 --> 00:12:21.241 position:50% align:center
but we searched
all those places thoroughly.

00:12:21.324 --> 00:12:23.535 position:50% align:center
Well, that's that. Let's go.

00:12:23.618 --> 00:12:25.453 position:50% align:center
[VILLAGE ELDER 03A]
Wait just a moment.

00:12:27.622 --> 00:12:29.833 position:50% align:center
There's something
I think you should know.

00:12:29.916 --> 00:12:32.794 position:50% align:center
Our village has had an
experience like this before.

00:12:32.877 --> 00:12:34.546 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:12:34.629 --> 00:12:36.131 position:50% align:center
[VILLAGE ELDER 03A]
About 10 years ago,

00:12:36.214 --> 00:12:38.758 position:50% align:center
the Empire built some
kind of research facility

00:12:38.842 --> 00:12:41.052 position:50% align:center
up on the mountain.

00:12:41.136 --> 00:12:43.596 position:50% align:center
A while later,
some soldiers informed us

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:46.725 position:50% align:center
that a number of lab
animals had escaped.

00:12:46.808 --> 00:12:50.061 position:50% align:center
However, we didn't pay it
much mind at the time

00:12:50.145 --> 00:12:52.105 position:50% align:center
until afterwards,
when several villagers

00:12:52.188 --> 00:12:54.899 position:50% align:center
went missing and were
found dead in the forest,

00:12:54.983 --> 00:12:56.776 position:50% align:center
with their stomachs sliced open.

--Whoa.
--Wait.

00:12:58.403 --> 00:13:01.406 position:50% align:center
Is that what you were talking
about when we first arrived?

00:13:01.489 --> 00:13:03.616 position:50% align:center
So, you overheard.

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:06.077 position:50% align:center
Anyway, they said they
killed the lab animals,

00:13:06.161 --> 00:13:07.704 position:50% align:center
but maybe there were
more that lived,

00:13:07.787 --> 00:13:10.165 position:50% align:center
and they're still
out there on the prowl.

00:13:26.431 --> 00:13:30.226 position:50% align:center

like kids' footprints.
