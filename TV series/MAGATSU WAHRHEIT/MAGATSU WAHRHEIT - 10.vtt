00:02:09.462 --> 00:02:13.717 position:50% align:center
[GEORG] I am Georg Eszterházy,
Commander of the Holy Knights.

00:02:14.718 --> 00:02:17.303 position:50% align:center
Uh, my name's
Innumael Grauer.

00:02:17.387 --> 00:02:19.097 position:50% align:center
I'm Arnolt Schwartz, sir.

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:20.849 position:50% align:center
And I'm Benjamin Pavard.

00:02:20.932 --> 00:02:23.351 position:50% align:center
Hello, Schaake Gutheil.

00:02:23.435 --> 00:02:27.647 position:50% align:center
Your name is Gutheil?
As in the Gutheils?

00:02:27.731 --> 00:02:31.359 position:50% align:center
[SCHAAKE]
Yes. Is something wrong?

00:02:31.443 --> 00:02:32.819 position:50% align:center
Not at all.

00:02:34.696 --> 00:02:36.698 position:50% align:center
Please, have a seat.

00:02:38.324 --> 00:02:42.328 position:50% align:center
[GEORG] Yes, I see.
So, she has passed away.

00:02:42.412 --> 00:02:44.998 position:50% align:center
What is that pendant, anyway?

00:02:45.081 --> 00:02:46.875 position:50% align:center
[GEORG] Most likely,
this is a prototype

00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:49.336 position:50% align:center
with Qliphothic Crystal.

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:51.588 position:50% align:center
What's a Qliphothic Crystal?

00:02:51.671 --> 00:02:55.717 position:50% align:center
Supposedly, it's able to capture
and seal away cataclysmic light.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.219 position:50% align:center
[INNUMAEL]
And what's cataclysmic light?

00:02:59.679 --> 00:03:03.141 position:50% align:center
[GEORG] As Captain of the Holy
Knights, I, Georg Eszterházy,

00:03:03.224 --> 00:03:05.852 position:50% align:center
have appeared before you
as ordered, Your Majesty.

00:03:05.935 --> 00:03:08.355 position:50% align:center
[EMPEROR] At ease, Captain.
You may rise.

00:03:08.438 --> 00:03:10.273 position:50% align:center
[GEORG]
Thank you.

00:03:10.357 --> 00:03:13.860 position:50% align:center
Sir, I notice the
Imperial Guard is absent.

00:03:13.943 --> 00:03:15.820 position:50% align:center
[EMPEROR]
I dismissed them.

00:03:15.904 --> 00:03:18.490 position:50% align:center
This matter is not
for others' ears.

00:03:18.573 --> 00:03:21.117 position:50% align:center
Do you mean this is
a secret matter?

00:03:21.201 --> 00:03:23.286 position:50% align:center
I wish to make a request.

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.372 position:50% align:center
[GEORG]
A request?

00:03:25.455 --> 00:03:27.207 position:50% align:center
Anything you wish.

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.334 position:50% align:center
[EMPEROR] An ancient
calamity shall soon strike

00:03:29.417 --> 00:03:31.503 position:50% align:center
the Empire once again.

00:03:31.586 --> 00:03:35.256 position:50% align:center
An "ancient calamity."
What, Your Majesty?

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.175 position:50% align:center
[EMPEROR] You know,
five-hundred years past,

00:03:37.258 --> 00:03:40.553 position:50% align:center
a phenomenon of cataclysmic
light occurred, yes?

00:03:40.637 --> 00:03:42.889 position:50% align:center
[GEORG]
Cataclysmic light.

00:03:42.972 --> 00:03:45.600 position:50% align:center
I have seen it mentioned
in archaic texts.

00:03:45.684 --> 00:03:48.478 position:50% align:center
I've read "cataclysmic light
is light that rains down

00:03:48.561 --> 00:03:51.272 position:50% align:center
from the heavens,
bringing harm to humanity."

00:03:51.356 --> 00:03:55.276 position:50% align:center
That is exactly right,
and it's about to occur again.

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.446 position:50% align:center
Your Majesty,
as far as I am aware,

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.116 position:50% align:center
most scholars regard
that as ancient allegory,

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:03.410 position:50% align:center
to be interpreted loosely.

00:04:05.954 --> 00:04:07.205 position:50% align:center
[MINERVA GUTHEIL]
Legend has it

00:04:07.288 --> 00:04:10.041 position:50% align:center
that past cataclysmic
light strikes

00:04:10.125 --> 00:04:12.836 position:50% align:center
have resulted in the ruin
of many nations.

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:14.629 position:50% align:center
And the Empire
has in its possession

00:04:14.713 --> 00:04:16.798 position:50% align:center
what is known as
a prophecy slate.

00:04:16.881 --> 00:04:18.758 position:50% align:center
They keep it concealed,
and only those

00:04:18.842 --> 00:04:20.760 position:50% align:center
whom the Emperor
permits to may see it.

00:04:20.844 --> 00:04:22.637 position:50% align:center
It is known as
the Garnet Tablet.

00:04:22.721 --> 00:04:24.556 position:50% align:center
Garnet Tablet?

00:04:25.682 --> 00:04:27.767 position:50% align:center
[GEORG]
What is this?

00:04:27.851 --> 00:04:30.186 position:50% align:center
Behold, the Garnet Tablet.

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.897 position:50% align:center
No one knows how long
it has existed.

00:04:32.981 --> 00:04:35.358 position:50% align:center
A stela that tells the future.

00:04:35.442 --> 00:04:38.153 position:50% align:center
Few within the Empire
are aware of its existence.

00:04:38.236 --> 00:04:39.320 position:50% align:center
Future?

00:04:39.404 --> 00:04:42.240 position:50% align:center
It foretells that
the light will strike

00:04:42.323 --> 00:04:44.659 position:50% align:center
and destroy the
capital very soon.

00:04:44.743 --> 00:04:47.662 position:50% align:center
How soon? What does
it mean, Your Majesty?

00:04:47.746 --> 00:04:49.080 position:50% align:center
I do not know.

00:04:49.164 --> 00:04:52.417 position:50% align:center
It reveals only that
cataclysmic light will strike.

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.252 position:50% align:center
I've no further details.

00:04:54.336 --> 00:04:56.921 position:50% align:center
The precise timing of
the event, its exact nature,

00:04:57.005 --> 00:05:01.092 position:50% align:center
and the full outcome of it
all remain unknown.

00:05:01.176 --> 00:05:02.427 position:50% align:center
So, what you're saying is that

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:04.471 position:50% align:center
the Emperor believes
in fairy tales?

00:05:04.554 --> 00:05:07.932 position:50% align:center
Recently, monster activity
has increased tenfold,

00:05:08.016 --> 00:05:11.978 position:50% align:center
and Coldfire has become a great
deal more active, as well.

00:05:12.062 --> 00:05:14.022 position:50% align:center
Can you explain these anomalies?

00:05:14.105 --> 00:05:16.399 position:50% align:center
[INNUMAEL]
Uh, well, I can't.

00:05:16.483 --> 00:05:18.193 position:50% align:center
[GEORG] One might even
go so far as to argue

00:05:18.276 --> 00:05:19.778 position:50% align:center
that this is the
reason Headkeeper

00:05:19.861 --> 00:05:22.030 position:50% align:center
came about in the first place.

00:05:23.573 --> 00:05:26.201 position:50% align:center
In preparation for
the cataclysmic light,

00:05:26.284 --> 00:05:28.620 position:50% align:center
His Majesty has put
the Strahl Plan into action.

00:05:28.703 --> 00:05:29.996 position:50% align:center
Covertly, of course.

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.123 position:50% align:center
The Strahl Plan? What's that?

00:05:32.207 --> 00:05:34.292 position:50% align:center
[GEORG]
A three-pronged approach.

00:05:34.376 --> 00:05:37.504 position:50% align:center
The first phase was to construct
the new capital, Fiktion,

00:05:37.587 --> 00:05:40.256 position:50% align:center
to decentralize the
axis of government.

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.884 position:50% align:center
In addition, he wished
to send Lord Arment here,

00:05:42.967 --> 00:05:45.345 position:50% align:center
or, I should say,
evacuate him here,

00:05:45.428 --> 00:05:47.889 position:50% align:center
as he is first in line
to the throne.

00:05:47.972 --> 00:05:51.184 position:50% align:center
The scale of this is so grand.
I don't quite understand it.

00:05:51.267 --> 00:05:53.645 position:50% align:center
So, you're saying that
he built this entire city

00:05:53.728 --> 00:05:55.980 position:50% align:center
just because of some prophecy?

00:05:56.064 --> 00:05:59.317 position:50% align:center
Once that was complete,
he ordered the Holy Knights,

00:05:59.401 --> 00:06:02.404 position:50% align:center
the Imperial Magicians,
and a portion of the Diet

00:06:02.487 --> 00:06:06.074 position:50% align:center
to move to Fiktion in advance,
to govern in the interim.

00:06:06.157 --> 00:06:09.160 position:50% align:center
The second prong is
construction of the Cradle.

00:06:09.244 --> 00:06:10.453 position:50% align:center
[INNUMAEL]
What's the Cradle?

00:06:10.537 --> 00:06:11.955 position:50% align:center
[GEORG]
It's a barrier to seal off

00:06:12.038 --> 00:06:14.874 position:50% align:center
the cataclysmic light
and the capital.

00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:16.960 position:50% align:center
I assume you're all aware
of the 12 towers

00:06:17.043 --> 00:06:19.838 position:50% align:center
built on the outer wall
of the central district.

00:06:19.921 --> 00:06:21.464 position:50% align:center
That's the Cradle.

00:06:21.548 --> 00:06:22.966 position:50% align:center
Fascinating.

00:06:23.049 --> 00:06:24.592 position:50% align:center
[GEORG] The third prong
of the Strahl Plan

00:06:24.676 --> 00:06:27.137 position:50% align:center
is to use a
light-inducing device,

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:29.097 position:50% align:center
something known as
a Luminous Seed,

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:30.849 position:50% align:center
to break up the light's power.

00:06:30.932 --> 00:06:32.600 position:50% align:center
How could they
break up its power?

00:06:32.684 --> 00:06:36.104 position:50% align:center
Well, apparently it functions
as a sort of lightning rod.

00:06:36.187 --> 00:06:39.149 position:50% align:center
The idea is to temper
the foretold light's power

00:06:39.232 --> 00:06:41.568 position:50% align:center
by causing several
smaller lights to strike,

00:06:41.651 --> 00:06:44.320 position:50% align:center
which might mitigate
the overall damage.

00:06:44.404 --> 00:06:46.614 position:50% align:center
I'm told Imperial
special forces have been

00:06:46.698 --> 00:06:49.325 position:50% align:center
carrying out that
mission in secret.

00:06:55.248 --> 00:06:59.169 position:50% align:center
[GEORG] However,
there has been a problem.

00:06:59.252 --> 00:07:00.795 position:50% align:center
[SCHAAKE] They can't
manage to whittle away

00:07:00.879 --> 00:07:02.630 position:50% align:center
at the cataclysmic light?

00:07:02.714 --> 00:07:04.674 position:50% align:center
Not quite. In fact,
you might say

00:07:04.758 --> 00:07:07.927 position:50% align:center
their strategy was
too successful, actually.

00:07:08.011 --> 00:07:11.431 position:50% align:center
[ARNOLT] How so?
What do you mean by that?

00:07:11.514 --> 00:07:12.766 position:50% align:center
[GEORG] The light
the Luminous Seed induced

00:07:12.849 --> 00:07:15.018 position:50% align:center
was far more powerful
than anticipated,

00:07:15.101 --> 00:07:16.770 position:50% align:center
with an unintended consequence.

00:07:16.853 --> 00:07:19.522 position:50% align:center
It caught the eye of
the Anti-imperialists.

00:07:19.606 --> 00:07:21.941 position:50% align:center
So, my job was to
collect evidence

00:07:22.025 --> 00:07:26.654 position:50% align:center
that could identify the leader
of the Anti-imperialists.

00:07:26.738 --> 00:07:29.157 position:50% align:center
But unfortunately, I failed.

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.284 position:50% align:center
They discovered my efforts
and imprisoned me.

00:07:31.368 --> 00:07:33.370 position:50% align:center
Anti-imperialists?

00:07:33.453 --> 00:07:34.746 position:50% align:center
[MINERVA GUTHEIL] A faction
of the Diet that aims

00:07:34.829 --> 00:07:37.957 position:50% align:center
to wrest control of the
government from the Emperor.

00:07:38.041 --> 00:07:40.210 position:50% align:center
A group like that really exists?

00:07:40.293 --> 00:07:42.128 position:50% align:center
[MINERVA GUTHEIL] A number of
particularly extreme members

00:07:42.212 --> 00:07:45.882 position:50% align:center
of the faction set their sights
on the Luminous Seed.

00:07:45.965 --> 00:07:47.801 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO]
Luminous Seed?

00:07:49.302 --> 00:07:51.221 position:50% align:center
[JADE] I hear the
facility in Altar Forest

00:07:51.304 --> 00:07:53.098 position:50% align:center
was also blown away.

00:07:54.933 --> 00:07:56.434 position:50% align:center
[JADE]
Anyway, I suppose you'd

00:07:56.518 --> 00:07:58.895 position:50% align:center
better report this
to your master.

00:07:59.896 --> 00:08:03.775 position:50% align:center
[SUBORDINATE 10A]
This way! Walk faster!

00:08:04.943 --> 00:08:06.778 position:50% align:center
Come on, keep moving!

00:08:10.865 --> 00:08:12.117 position:50% align:center
No!

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:15.036 position:50% align:center
[SUBORDINATE 10A] We found
these two hiding nearby.

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:19.666 position:50% align:center
[JADE] Oh, just taking a little
stroll way out here, I presume?

00:08:19.749 --> 00:08:21.584 position:50% align:center
After what you've done here,

00:08:21.668 --> 00:08:24.337 position:50% align:center
do you really believe
you can keep it all secret?

00:08:24.421 --> 00:08:25.422 position:50% align:center
[JADE]
I knew there were people

00:08:25.505 --> 00:08:28.842 position:50% align:center
sniffing around
for us, but this--

00:08:29.634 --> 00:08:33.555 position:50% align:center
Who is this "master"?
Whom do you report to?

00:08:33.638 --> 00:08:34.806 position:50% align:center
[FRITZ]
Should I kill her?

00:08:34.889 --> 00:08:37.559 position:50% align:center
[JADE]
No, wait. I have a better idea.

00:08:37.642 --> 00:08:39.352 position:50% align:center
[FRITZ]
You mean to let her live?

00:08:39.436 --> 00:08:45.275 position:50% align:center
[JADE] Yes. In fact,
this couldn't be more perfect.

00:08:48.695 --> 00:08:50.989 position:50% align:center
It would be extremely dangerous,

00:08:51.072 --> 00:08:53.199 position:50% align:center
but I want you to
smuggle it out.

00:08:53.283 --> 00:08:56.453 position:50% align:center
Get the Luminous Seed
far from the capital.

00:08:56.536 --> 00:08:58.913 position:50% align:center
[SCHAAKE] So then,
are there very many of them?

00:08:58.997 --> 00:09:00.373 position:50% align:center
These Luminous Seeds?

00:09:00.457 --> 00:09:03.501 position:50% align:center
Oh, no. There's
only one original.

00:09:03.585 --> 00:09:06.212 position:50% align:center
However, they have been
attempting to reproduce

00:09:06.296 --> 00:09:09.299 position:50% align:center
the Luminous Seed
behind closed doors.

00:09:10.884 --> 00:09:12.135 position:50% align:center
[INNUMAEL]
Those are--

00:09:12.218 --> 00:09:14.429 position:50% align:center
The things we were transporting!

00:09:16.473 --> 00:09:18.641 position:50% align:center
That mark. Right.

00:09:20.143 --> 00:09:21.561 position:50% align:center
[ARNOLT]
Elfriede.

00:09:22.687 --> 00:09:26.191 position:50% align:center
Elfriede said there was
a traitor among us. Remember?

00:09:27.233 --> 00:09:29.069 position:50% align:center
Does that mean
Jade's the traitor?

00:09:29.152 --> 00:09:31.988 position:50% align:center
So then, he's connected to
the Anti-imperialists somehow!

00:09:32.072 --> 00:09:34.741 position:50% align:center
Sure is what it sounds like.

00:09:34.824 --> 00:09:37.077 position:50% align:center
And Irma told me that
there hadn't been

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:39.788 position:50% align:center
rescue missions
in the capital before.

00:09:39.871 --> 00:09:42.874 position:50% align:center
[IRMA] My Headkeeper activities
have been mainly in the capital,

00:09:42.957 --> 00:09:46.169 position:50% align:center
but this is my first
rescue operation.

00:09:46.252 --> 00:09:48.421 position:50% align:center
Other people have been
captured before.

00:09:48.505 --> 00:09:51.466 position:50% align:center
So, why're we doing rescue
missions all of a sudden?

00:09:51.549 --> 00:09:54.886 position:50% align:center
It was Jade that sent us
to the capital, right guys?

00:09:54.969 --> 00:09:57.597 position:50% align:center
[ARNOLT grunts]
That bastard.

00:09:57.681 --> 00:10:00.100 position:50% align:center
Around ten years ago,
they experimented with

00:10:00.183 --> 00:10:02.018 position:50% align:center
a tragically
imperfect reproduction

00:10:02.102 --> 00:10:03.603 position:50% align:center
of the Luminous Seed.

00:10:03.687 --> 00:10:07.232 position:50% align:center
Sadly, the result was that an
entire village was blown away.

00:10:07.315 --> 00:10:08.650 position:50% align:center
[ARNOLT]
What?

00:10:08.733 --> 00:10:10.985 position:50% align:center
I dare say they were all
taken by surprise, as well.

00:10:11.069 --> 00:10:13.154 position:50% align:center
Hang on. If something
like that happened,

00:10:13.238 --> 00:10:15.490 position:50% align:center
why haven't any of us
heard anything about it?

00:10:15.573 --> 00:10:17.283 position:50% align:center
There was a massive cover-up.

00:10:17.367 --> 00:10:18.993 position:50% align:center
[INNUMAEL]
What?

00:10:19.077 --> 00:10:21.955 position:50% align:center
[GEORG] And it was orchestrated
by Duke Lotus Gutheil.

00:10:22.038 --> 00:10:23.289 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:10:23.373 --> 00:10:24.791 position:50% align:center
[GEORG] The experiment
was most likely carried out

00:10:24.874 --> 00:10:26.126 position:50% align:center
by this Jade person...

00:10:26.209 --> 00:10:28.086 position:50% align:center
My father did that?

00:10:28.169 --> 00:10:29.754 position:50% align:center
[GEORG] Supposedly,
he was working as an aide

00:10:29.838 --> 00:10:32.132 position:50% align:center
to the duke at the time.

00:10:32.215 --> 00:10:33.383 position:50% align:center
He was?

00:10:33.466 --> 00:10:36.594 position:50% align:center
Why on earth would my
father do such a thing?

00:10:36.678 --> 00:10:38.763 position:50% align:center
[GEORG] Your mother,
Diet Member Minerva,

00:10:38.847 --> 00:10:40.724 position:50% align:center
had been taken
hostage at the time.

00:10:40.807 --> 00:10:44.060 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Do you mean
she might be alive?

00:10:44.144 --> 00:10:46.980 position:50% align:center
[GEORG]
I'm sorry. That I don't know.

00:10:47.063 --> 00:10:48.606 position:50% align:center
Without informing His Majesty,

00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:52.569 position:50% align:center
I began an investigation
into the Anti-imperialists.

00:10:52.652 --> 00:10:54.320 position:50% align:center
In order to monitor
the activities

00:10:54.404 --> 00:10:56.281 position:50% align:center
of suspicious Diet members,

00:10:56.364 --> 00:10:59.242 position:50% align:center
I embedded trusted
subordinates as spies.

00:10:59.325 --> 00:11:00.368 position:50% align:center
That's the mission.

00:11:00.452 --> 00:11:02.078 position:50% align:center
[GEORG'S SPIES]
Yes, sir!

00:11:03.413 --> 00:11:04.748 position:50% align:center
[GEORG]
Elfriede.

00:11:04.831 --> 00:11:06.499 position:50% align:center
Yes? What is it, sir?

00:11:06.583 --> 00:11:08.752 position:50% align:center
Are you familiar with
the smuggling organization

00:11:08.835 --> 00:11:10.003 position:50% align:center
known as Headkeeper?

00:11:10.086 --> 00:11:11.171 position:50% align:center
[ELFRIEDE]
Yes.

00:11:11.254 --> 00:11:12.756 position:50% align:center
Your mission is to
infiltrate Headkeeper

00:11:12.839 --> 00:11:14.632 position:50% align:center
and report back to me.

00:11:14.716 --> 00:11:15.842 position:50% align:center
But why?

00:11:15.925 --> 00:11:17.218 position:50% align:center
[GEORG]
The weapons they smuggle enter

00:11:17.302 --> 00:11:19.471 position:50% align:center
the black market
through the military.

00:11:19.554 --> 00:11:21.389 position:50% align:center
For that reason,
I see a high likelihood

00:11:21.473 --> 00:11:24.851 position:50% align:center
there's a sympathizer
behind the scenes.

00:11:24.934 --> 00:11:27.520 position:50% align:center
[ELFRIEDE]
An Anti-imperialist, you mean?

00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:31.399 position:50% align:center
Understood, sir.

00:11:31.483 --> 00:11:34.152 position:50% align:center
[ARNOLT gasps]
Wait, infiltrate us?

00:11:34.235 --> 00:11:35.320 position:50% align:center
Yes, she did.

00:11:35.403 --> 00:11:36.946 position:50% align:center
And, because of the
intel she provided,

00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:38.490 position:50% align:center
I've managed at last to identify

00:11:38.573 --> 00:11:41.117 position:50% align:center
the central figure of
the Anti-imperialists.

00:11:41.201 --> 00:11:42.702 position:50% align:center
This person is also responsible

00:11:42.786 --> 00:11:44.537 position:50% align:center
for siphoning off
Headkeeper's money,

00:11:44.621 --> 00:11:47.040 position:50% align:center
to fund the
Anti-imperialist movement.

00:11:47.123 --> 00:11:49.918 position:50% align:center
And just who would that be?

00:11:50.001 --> 00:11:52.545 position:50% align:center
One Mary Bult,
of the House of Peers.

00:11:52.629 --> 00:11:54.297 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:11:54.381 --> 00:11:57.759 position:50% align:center
[GEORG]
And her son Radboud.

00:11:57.842 --> 00:12:00.178 position:50% align:center
I believe he is
involved too, somehow.

00:12:00.261 --> 00:12:01.930 position:50% align:center
Radboud, too?

00:12:09.771 --> 00:12:11.690 position:50% align:center
[GEORG]
I have a request to make.

00:12:12.774 --> 00:12:15.610 position:50% align:center
I am unable to leave
the new capital.

00:12:15.694 --> 00:12:19.280 position:50% align:center
I need you all to find evidence
of Mary Bult's treason,

00:12:19.364 --> 00:12:21.908 position:50% align:center
and then inform the Emperor.

00:12:23.868 --> 00:12:27.330 position:50% align:center
That's a pretty weighty
request, if you ask me.

00:12:44.597 --> 00:12:45.682 position:50% align:center
[door opens]

00:12:45.765 --> 00:12:47.100 position:50% align:center
Who's there?

00:12:48.685 --> 00:12:50.103 position:50% align:center
Sorry, bad time?

00:12:50.186 --> 00:12:53.106 position:50% align:center
No, not at all!
Please come right on in.

00:12:53.189 --> 00:12:54.024 position:50% align:center
[SCHAAKE]
Mind if I sit?

00:12:54.107 --> 00:12:55.859 position:50% align:center
[INNUMAEL]
No, of course not.

00:12:56.985 --> 00:13:00.113 position:50% align:center
This has all gotten a little bit
out of hand, don'tcha think?

00:13:00.196 --> 00:13:03.241 position:50% align:center
[INNUMAEL chuckles]

00:13:03.324 --> 00:13:04.492 position:50% align:center
I'm sure you know,

00:13:04.576 --> 00:13:06.453 position:50% align:center
my mother disappeared
about ten years back.

00:13:06.536 --> 00:13:08.997 position:50% align:center
Uh... Yeah.

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:11.458 position:50% align:center
She was also in the Diet.

00:13:11.541 --> 00:13:13.251 position:50% align:center
[INNUMAEL]
Okay.

00:13:13.335 --> 00:13:15.795 position:50% align:center
I have a feeling that
she probably learned

00:13:15.879 --> 00:13:18.757 position:50% align:center
too much about the
Anti-imperialists. That's why--

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:20.216 position:50% align:center
Hey, stop it.

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:22.635 position:50% align:center
There's a chance
she's still alive, maybe.

00:13:22.719 --> 00:13:25.638 position:50% align:center
My father has to know
what the whole story is.

00:13:25.722 --> 00:13:28.058 position:50% align:center
So, tomorrow,
as soon as possible,

00:13:28.141 --> 00:13:29.642 position:50% align:center
I'm returning to Gutheil.

00:13:29.726 --> 00:13:33.146 position:50% align:center
Oh, I see. I think
that's a good idea.

00:13:33.229 --> 00:13:35.398 position:50% align:center
I want to apologize
for everything.

00:13:35.482 --> 00:13:37.192 position:50% align:center
For getting you
mixed up in this.

00:13:37.275 --> 00:13:40.320 position:50% align:center
So, what Commander
Georg asked of you.

00:13:40.403 --> 00:13:42.155 position:50% align:center
I'd understand if you refused.

00:13:42.238 --> 00:13:43.406 position:50% align:center
[INNUMAEL]
No, I'm doing it.

00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:44.991 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:13:45.075 --> 00:13:47.994 position:50% align:center
[INNUMAEL] I wasn't put in my
current circumstances by choice,

00:13:48.078 --> 00:13:51.164 position:50% align:center
but I did come here
of my own free will.

00:13:51.247 --> 00:13:53.249 position:50% align:center
So, I feel like I'd regret it

00:13:53.333 --> 00:13:57.420 position:50% align:center
if I didn't see this
through to the end.

00:13:57.504 --> 00:14:01.049 position:50% align:center
You know what I mean? [chuckles]

00:14:01.132 --> 00:14:05.553 position:50% align:center
[chuckles] I appreciate
that, Innumael.

00:14:05.637 --> 00:14:07.639 position:50% align:center
[INNUMAEL]
Yeah.

00:14:10.141 --> 00:14:11.726 position:50% align:center
All right then,
once we're finished,

00:14:11.810 --> 00:14:13.311 position:50% align:center
we'll come and join you.

Oh, no, not at all.

[INNUMAEL]
What's this?

00:14:32.205 --> 00:14:33.748 position:50% align:center
This note will allow you

with His Majesty, the Emperor.

00:14:36.001 --> 00:14:37.669 position:50% align:center
Oh, one more thing.

00:14:37.752 --> 00:14:41.798 position:50% align:center
This might be helpful to you.
I want you to take it.

Oh, thank you very much.

That was a solid week

So, how'd you like
solitary? Fun times?

Yeah.

00:15:05.155 --> 00:15:07.073 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO] I don't have
the keys, obviously.

00:15:07.157 --> 00:15:09.117 position:50% align:center
Now what are we supposed to do?

Well, with what went down,

00:15:26.134 --> 00:15:29.179 position:50% align:center
tossing the keys out the window
was really the only option.

00:15:31.181 --> 00:15:33.224 position:50% align:center
[DAMIAN]
Come on, now, don't be so mad.

00:15:33.308 --> 00:15:35.101 position:50% align:center
Look, if I was gonna betray you,

00:15:35.185 --> 00:15:37.520 position:50% align:center
don't you think I'd
be long gone by now?

a good night's sleep and
build up your stamina.

Hey. What're you doing?

00:15:56.331 --> 00:15:58.875 position:50% align:center

00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:02.379 position:50% align:center
Okay. Well, are you going to
let me out, too, or what?

00:16:02.462 --> 00:16:05.507 position:50% align:center
Nope. You're not
going anywhere, man.

Uh? What's going on?

00:16:07.592 --> 00:16:11.012 position:50% align:center
You're a little slow

You mean...
you're betraying me?!

00:16:15.433 --> 00:16:17.602 position:50% align:center
[DAMIAN]
No, see, this is the plan!

00:16:17.686 --> 00:16:20.230 position:50% align:center
I'll blow a hole under
the toilet with this.

00:16:20.313 --> 00:16:22.273 position:50% align:center
And you will go out
through the sewer,

00:16:22.357 --> 00:16:23.775 position:50% align:center
just like I told you.

00:16:23.858 --> 00:16:25.860 position:50% align:center
Then, drawn by the
noise of the explosion

00:16:25.944 --> 00:16:27.070 position:50% align:center
and our fellow inmates,

00:16:27.153 --> 00:16:29.155 position:50% align:center
the guards will all
come rushing over here.

00:16:29.239 --> 00:16:30.365 position:50% align:center
And--?

00:16:30.448 --> 00:16:31.991 position:50% align:center
Then I'll take
the liberty of escaping

00:16:32.075 --> 00:16:34.285 position:50% align:center

00:16:34.369 --> 00:16:36.079 position:50% align:center
You bastard!

[DAMIAN]
I told you!

00:16:37.706 --> 00:16:40.291 position:50% align:center
In order to leave, you have to
either finish your sentence,

00:16:40.375 --> 00:16:41.918 position:50% align:center
or you can go
through the morgue.

00:16:42.002 --> 00:16:44.087 position:50% align:center
However, I'll be
getting out another way.

00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:45.922 position:50% align:center
You'll leave as a corpse.

00:16:46.006 --> 00:16:49.676 position:50% align:center

you buy me plenty of time.
