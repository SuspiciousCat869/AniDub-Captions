Oh, Schaake. You're back.

00:00:46.046 --> 00:00:49.090 position:50% align:center
Sir Georg.
He told me everything.

00:00:49.174 --> 00:00:51.092 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:00:51.176 --> 00:00:53.345 position:50% align:center
[SCHAAKE] I know you've
been helping Headkeeper,

00:00:53.428 --> 00:00:56.431 position:50% align:center
or the Anti-
imperialists, rather.

00:00:58.683 --> 00:01:01.436 position:50% align:center
Do you know if Mother is alive?

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:05.315 position:50% align:center
[LOTUS GUTHEIL]
Yes. I have to believe she is.

Otherwise, it's all
been for nothing.

00:01:08.068 --> 00:01:11.988 position:50% align:center
[JADE] Don't worry, hon.
She's alive in the capital.

00:01:12.072 --> 00:01:14.699 position:50% align:center
[SCHAAKE]
Jade? Why are you here?

00:01:14.783 --> 00:01:18.661 position:50% align:center
[JADE] Isn't it obvious?
My people told me you came back.

00:01:18.745 --> 00:01:21.706 position:50% align:center
Instead of headquarters,
you came here, dearie.

So, here I am.

00:01:23.667 --> 00:01:26.211 position:50% align:center
I assumed you'd been
caught in the mass roundup,

00:01:26.294 --> 00:01:27.671 position:50% align:center
but it seems you've learned

00:01:27.754 --> 00:01:30.423 position:50% align:center
all kinds of
inconvenient facts, huh?

00:01:30.507 --> 00:01:32.008 position:50% align:center
[SCHAAKE]
It was you.

00:01:32.092 --> 00:01:35.095 position:50% align:center
You killed all those people

Yes, it was half me.
Any guesses on the other half?

Now, then.

00:01:47.524 --> 00:01:51.277 position:50% align:center
A mother-daughter prison

No! Don't shoot!

Haven't I always done
everything you've asked of me?

00:01:58.576 --> 00:02:02.706 position:50% align:center
That's true. However,
I've no need of her.

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:05.500 position:50% align:center
No! Don't!

00:02:22.726 --> 00:02:25.895 position:50% align:center

00:15:44.069 --> 00:15:46.321 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO]
Okay. Leave it to me.

00:15:46.404 --> 00:15:48.656 position:50% align:center
I'll see that he gets it.

00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:50.867 position:50% align:center
And this is yours.

00:15:55.747 --> 00:16:00.502 position:50% align:center
[INNUMAEL gasps]
Hang on. How do you have this?

00:16:00.585 --> 00:16:04.964 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO] Sorry. I forgot that
Sissel had given it to me.

00:16:05.965 --> 00:16:09.219 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO] With everything that
happened, it slipped my mind.

00:16:09.302 --> 00:16:13.306 position:50% align:center
But you know, it seems like
that's what saved you.

00:16:13.390 --> 00:16:15.266 position:50% align:center
So cut me some slack.

00:16:17.435 --> 00:16:19.562 position:50% align:center
[INNUMAEL]
Thank you, Leo.

00:16:19.646 --> 00:16:22.065 position:50% align:center
But shouldn't you get going?

00:16:23.024 --> 00:16:26.736 position:50% align:center
The Cradle. It's going
to isolate the capital.

00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:29.698 position:50% align:center
Once that happens,
there's no getting out.

00:16:29.781 --> 00:16:33.284 position:50% align:center
Got it. Hey, listen.

00:16:33.368 --> 00:16:37.122 position:50% align:center
Do you have something that
you want me to tell Sissel?

00:16:41.251 --> 00:16:42.794 position:50% align:center
I understand.

00:16:44.212 --> 00:16:45.171 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO]
Hm?

00:16:46.423 --> 00:16:50.301 position:50% align:center
About your brother. Sorry.

00:16:52.303 --> 00:16:53.888 position:50% align:center
So long.

00:17:18.329 --> 00:17:24.044 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO pants] It's no use.
I'll never make it in time.

00:17:26.755 --> 00:17:28.298 position:50% align:center
Is that--?

00:17:31.551 --> 00:17:34.012 position:50% align:center
Who would have thought
you'd get here before me?

00:17:34.095 --> 00:17:35.096 position:50% align:center
Hey, kid.

00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:38.141 position:50% align:center
Huh? Old man.
You made it out safe?

00:17:38.224 --> 00:17:39.434 position:50% align:center
[ARNOLT chuckles]

00:17:39.517 --> 00:17:42.604 position:50% align:center
Hold on. I think you just
stole my line, kid.

00:17:42.687 --> 00:17:44.898 position:50% align:center
Where are Innumael and Ben?

00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:51.321 position:50% align:center
--Ah, I see.
--Come on! We gotta get moving!

00:17:51.404 --> 00:17:54.991 position:50% align:center
Yeah. There'll be time
to grieve the others later.

00:17:57.994 --> 00:18:02.332 position:50% align:center
[BENJAMIN]
Innumael! Are you down here?

00:18:03.625 --> 00:18:06.711 position:50% align:center
[BENJAMIN] If you're here,
please say something!

00:18:34.406 --> 00:18:39.077 position:50% align:center
[BENJAMIN] Hey buddy,
think you could wake up soon?

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:43.248 position:50% align:center
Hell of a tunnel.
I hope it leads out.

00:18:43.331 --> 00:18:46.710 position:50% align:center
[sighs] So, do you think
the others are okay?

00:18:48.461 --> 00:18:51.464 position:50% align:center
Huh? What do you
think that could be?

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:58.930 position:50% align:center
[gasps] What is that thing?

00:18:59.014 --> 00:19:00.807 position:50% align:center
Man, you don't think
more of these

00:19:00.890 --> 00:19:05.812 position:50% align:center
are living down here,
do you? What the--!

00:19:11.484 --> 00:19:13.862 position:50% align:center
Lucky. That was a close one.

00:19:29.627 --> 00:19:31.338 position:50% align:center
That's unbelievable.

00:19:31.421 --> 00:19:33.548 position:50% align:center
I have never seen magic
on this grand of a scale

00:19:33.631 --> 00:19:34.924 position:50% align:center
before in my life.

00:19:35.008 --> 00:19:37.677 position:50% align:center
It was actually able to
seal off an entire city.

00:19:37.761 --> 00:19:39.721 position:50% align:center
Now what are we s'posed to do?

00:19:39.804 --> 00:19:42.515 position:50% align:center
No way we can contact our
comrades through that.

00:19:42.599 --> 00:19:44.142 position:50% align:center
I'm thinking!

00:19:46.644 --> 00:19:49.314 position:50% align:center
Hey, kid. What are your plans?

00:19:49.397 --> 00:19:52.942 position:50% align:center
I intend to go in there
and search for Conrad.

00:19:53.026 --> 00:19:54.819 position:50% align:center
Find my siblings.

00:19:54.903 --> 00:19:57.113 position:50% align:center
Oh yeah. Sissel, too, probably.

00:19:57.197 --> 00:19:59.157 position:50% align:center
I'm sure he got them
all to safety.

00:20:00.158 --> 00:20:03.328 position:50% align:center
After that? I'll go
to the new capital.

00:20:03.411 --> 00:20:05.747 position:50% align:center
All right! I think I'll
tag along with you.

00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:07.207 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO]
Why would you do that?

00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:09.334 position:50% align:center
I have to return what I
borrowed from Conrad, right?

00:20:09.417 --> 00:20:11.961 position:50% align:center
No. I don't really think
that matters now, y'know?

00:20:12.045 --> 00:20:12.796 position:50% align:center
[IRMA]
I'm coming, too!

00:20:12.879 --> 00:20:15.298 position:50% align:center
Oh, come on. You too, Irma?

00:20:15.382 --> 00:20:16.716 position:50% align:center
[ARNOLT]
Well, shall we go?

00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:17.884 position:50% align:center
[IRMA]
Yeah!

00:20:17.967 --> 00:20:19.636 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO]
Can't you make your own plans?

00:20:34.526 --> 00:20:38.488 position:50% align:center
Now! The dawn of
a new Wahrheit Empire

00:20:38.571 --> 00:20:40.657 position:50% align:center
has come at last!

00:22:30.642 --> 00:22:33.645 position:50% align:center
[BENJAMIN] It's terrible. Two
weeks since that light struck,

00:22:33.728 --> 00:22:37.190 position:50% align:center
and things have gone
from bad to worse.

00:22:37.273 --> 00:22:40.193 position:50% align:center
No government. A lawless zone.

00:22:40.276 --> 00:22:42.570 position:50% align:center
It's a free-for-all.

00:22:42.654 --> 00:22:47.409 position:50% align:center
Although, I'm sure it's
better here than in there.

00:22:47.492 --> 00:22:50.370 position:50% align:center
I wonder if Arnolt
and the others are alive.

00:22:50.453 --> 00:22:53.081 position:50% align:center
Or maybe they
turned into monsters.

00:22:54.582 --> 00:22:56.459 position:50% align:center
[BENJAMIN]
The poor guy.

00:22:56.543 --> 00:23:00.130 position:50% align:center
With no chain of command,
the military's in shambles.

00:23:00.213 --> 00:23:02.215 position:50% align:center
There are even rumors
of despicable people

00:23:02.298 --> 00:23:06.302 position:50% align:center
using their military status
to become all-out bandits.

00:23:06.386 --> 00:23:09.472 position:50% align:center
Do you think Conrad and
Leocadio are doing okay?

00:23:13.518 --> 00:23:18.690 position:50% align:center
I swear I will protect her,
Your Majesty. She's safe.

00:23:18.773 --> 00:23:20.525 position:50% align:center
[INNUMAEL]
Are you okay?

00:23:22.652 --> 00:23:25.947 position:50% align:center
I beg you. Please, sir,
please take this child.

00:23:26.031 --> 00:23:27.699 position:50% align:center
Take her, please.

00:23:27.782 --> 00:23:29.659 position:50% align:center
Help me, sir.

00:23:29.743 --> 00:23:32.203 position:50% align:center
Please, you have to
help save this baby!

00:23:32.287 --> 00:23:36.541 position:50% align:center
[BENJAMIN] Look. That crest.
The Imperial bloodline?

00:23:37.792 --> 00:23:39.210 position:50% align:center
[INNUMAEL]
What is the child's name?

00:23:39.294 --> 00:23:41.588 position:50% align:center
She's his daughter.

00:23:41.671 --> 00:23:44.924 position:50% align:center
Her name's Rose. Rose Marie.

00:23:45.008 --> 00:23:46.551 position:50% align:center
Save her.

00:23:46.634 --> 00:23:50.096 position:50% align:center
She is His Imperial
Majesty's daughter.

00:23:50.180 --> 00:23:56.102 position:50% align:center
Please, sir. Please.
You have to protect her. I--

00:23:56.186 --> 00:23:58.772 position:50% align:center
[BENJAMIN sighs]
This again?

00:23:58.855 --> 00:24:00.231 position:50% align:center
[INNUMAEL]
What do you mean?

00:24:00.315 --> 00:24:03.234 position:50% align:center
[BENJAMIN] You have a real
talent for inviting trouble.

00:24:03.318 --> 00:24:05.111 position:50% align:center
It's uncanny, man.

00:24:08.031 --> 00:24:10.492 position:50% align:center
Well. Let's get going.
