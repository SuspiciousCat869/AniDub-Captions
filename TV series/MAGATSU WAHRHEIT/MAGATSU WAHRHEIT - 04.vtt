00:00:37.037 --> 00:00:40.582 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO] Why would he get
involved with a smuggling group?

00:00:40.665 --> 00:00:43.501 position:50% align:center
Nothing in his file points
to him doing that.

00:00:44.669 --> 00:00:46.921 position:50% align:center
[CONRAD] She's quite the cutie,
don't you think?

00:00:47.964 --> 00:00:49.299 position:50% align:center
It's a work assignment.

00:00:49.382 --> 00:00:51.134 position:50% align:center
It'd be inappropriate
to meet girls that way.

00:00:51.217 --> 00:00:54.471 position:50% align:center
[CONRAD laughs]
Ah, come on, lighten up.

00:00:54.554 --> 00:00:57.057 position:50% align:center
It'll be nice to have a girl
in the car for the ride back.

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:57.932 position:50% align:center
You know I'm right.

00:00:58.016 --> 00:01:00.352 position:50% align:center
[sighs] Don't be ridiculous.

00:01:11.905 --> 00:01:13.156 position:50% align:center
[CONRAD]
Well, here we are.

00:01:13.239 --> 00:01:16.868 position:50% align:center
The criminal's sister
lives here, supposedly.

00:01:16.951 --> 00:01:18.244 position:50% align:center
Watch yourself.

00:01:18.328 --> 00:01:20.455 position:50% align:center
She's his sister, but still,
don't be rough with her.

00:01:20.538 --> 00:01:22.165 position:50% align:center
C'mon, I know that!

00:01:22.248 --> 00:01:26.336 position:50% align:center
For real, what are you,
my mom? And besides--

00:01:28.421 --> 00:01:31.007 position:50% align:center
Her brother did
kill yours, after all.

00:01:31.091 --> 00:01:34.719 position:50% align:center
So don't go flying
off the handle, either.

00:01:34.803 --> 00:01:36.054 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO]
Zaitz.

00:01:48.692 --> 00:01:50.985 position:50% align:center
You've been kinda quiet.
Something wrong?

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:54.614 position:50% align:center
Oh. Uh, I'm just thinking about

00:01:54.698 --> 00:01:56.616 position:50% align:center
how worried my
little sister must be.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.243 position:50% align:center
You have a sister?

00:01:58.326 --> 00:01:59.786 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh.

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:03.206 position:50% align:center
She can't know the only family
she has left is a criminal.

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:06.167 position:50% align:center
How can I tell her that?
It would break her heart.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.838 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry you got involved.

00:02:09.921 --> 00:02:12.007 position:50% align:center
Yeah, well, too late.

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.550 position:50% align:center
[BENJAMIN]
Too bad we were delayed.

00:02:13.633 --> 00:02:16.469 position:50% align:center
The army's probably searching
in the Gutheil domain now.

00:02:16.553 --> 00:02:18.555 position:50% align:center
True. Before we enter the city,

00:02:18.638 --> 00:02:21.099 position:50% align:center
we need to make sure that
we're thoroughly prepared.

00:02:21.182 --> 00:02:23.601 position:50% align:center
What's the plan
once we get there, anyway?

00:02:23.685 --> 00:02:26.021 position:50% align:center
First, we'll track down
the Branch Chief for a meeting.

00:02:26.104 --> 00:02:27.731 position:50% align:center
We'll brief him about
our recent activities,

00:02:27.814 --> 00:02:29.441 position:50% align:center
then get our new instructions.

00:02:29.524 --> 00:02:31.901 position:50% align:center
[INNUMAEL] "Branch chief"?
You guys have one of those?

00:02:31.985 --> 00:02:35.488 position:50% align:center
I mean, Headkeeper is
a huge organization.

00:02:35.572 --> 00:02:37.741 position:50% align:center
As you're more than aware,
the Diet has prohibited

00:02:37.824 --> 00:02:40.285 position:50% align:center
transport of
Class two artillery.

00:02:41.244 --> 00:02:42.328 position:50% align:center
[INNUMAEL]
Right.

00:02:43.246 --> 00:02:45.081 position:50% align:center
[ARNOLT] And they did it knowing
that these mutant monsters

00:02:45.165 --> 00:02:46.791 position:50% align:center
that have appeared
in the last few years

00:02:46.875 --> 00:02:50.003 position:50% align:center
pose a major threat to
people all over the Empire.

00:02:50.086 --> 00:02:51.921 position:50% align:center
[INNUMAEL]
Wait, really?

00:02:52.005 --> 00:02:53.381 position:50% align:center
Which is why we're
more than willing

00:02:53.465 --> 00:02:55.925 position:50% align:center
to take the risk of
smuggling weapons.

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:58.303 position:50% align:center
Oh. That makes sense.

00:02:58.386 --> 00:03:01.389 position:50% align:center
So, um, how did you
come to join Headkeeper?

00:03:01.473 --> 00:03:02.432 position:50% align:center
If you don't mind saying.

00:03:02.515 --> 00:03:04.976 position:50% align:center
And why do you need to know?

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:06.061 position:50% align:center
[INNUMAEL]
Just curious.

00:03:06.144 --> 00:03:07.479 position:50% align:center
Let's just say
that everyone here

00:03:07.562 --> 00:03:09.981 position:50% align:center
has their reasons
and leave it at that.

00:03:37.342 --> 00:03:39.552 position:50% align:center
[VILLAGER 04A] What're
Imperial soldiers doing here?

00:03:39.636 --> 00:03:41.554 position:50% align:center
[VILLAGER 04B]
That's kinda odd.

00:03:41.638 --> 00:03:44.516 position:50% align:center
[CONRAD] Good day!
Mind if we have a word?

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:46.226 position:50% align:center
[VILLAGER 04C]
Sure, what about?

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:48.269 position:50% align:center
[CONRAD] We're looking
for the Grauer residence.

00:03:48.353 --> 00:03:49.479 position:50% align:center
Can you help?

00:03:49.562 --> 00:03:52.857 position:50% align:center
Uh... Sure thing, it's that one.

00:03:52.941 --> 00:03:54.359 position:50% align:center
Right over that way.

00:03:54.442 --> 00:03:57.529 position:50% align:center
Why, thank you, sir!
Appreciate it.

00:04:05.954 --> 00:04:09.124 position:50% align:center
Yes, what can I do for you?

00:04:09.207 --> 00:04:10.375 position:50% align:center
Greetings, Miss.

00:04:10.458 --> 00:04:14.004 position:50% align:center
Private Conrad Wilson.
Imperial Army squad six.

00:04:14.087 --> 00:04:17.382 position:50% align:center
Yes, hello. I'm Private
Leocadio WÃ¶hler.

00:04:17.465 --> 00:04:20.260 position:50% align:center
Is there something
I can do for you?

00:04:20.343 --> 00:04:23.388 position:50% align:center
You are Innumael Grauer's
little sister, correct?

00:04:23.471 --> 00:04:24.931 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO]
Hey, Conrad.

00:04:25.015 --> 00:04:28.101 position:50% align:center
Why don't you just let me
handle things from here?

00:04:28.184 --> 00:04:29.728 position:50% align:center
You see, miss--

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.232 position:50% align:center
[ELFRIEDE] I have confirmed
through other operatives

00:04:34.315 --> 00:04:37.402 position:50% align:center
that Headkeeper funds are
being routed to the capital

00:04:37.485 --> 00:04:40.697 position:50% align:center
from several of its
front organizations.

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:42.157 position:50% align:center
Still.

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:47.454 position:50% align:center
[ELFRIEDE]
There's this secret ledger.

00:04:47.537 --> 00:04:48.955 position:50% align:center
Some of the amounts listed in it

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:51.458 position:50% align:center
match in those in
Diet accounting reports.

00:04:51.541 --> 00:04:54.377 position:50% align:center
So, which department
got those payments?

00:04:54.461 --> 00:04:57.172 position:50% align:center
The Imperial Bureau of
Disease Prevention?

00:04:57.255 --> 00:04:58.840 position:50% align:center
But, why?

00:04:58.923 --> 00:05:03.511 position:50% align:center
[ELFRIEDE sighs] I have to
check out their facility, great.

00:05:03.595 --> 00:05:07.140 position:50% align:center
You mean he killed someone?

00:05:07.223 --> 00:05:08.391 position:50% align:center
It can't be!

00:05:08.475 --> 00:05:10.268 position:50% align:center
He'd never join
a smuggling organization,

00:05:10.352 --> 00:05:12.979 position:50% align:center
much less kill someone!

00:05:13.063 --> 00:05:16.232 position:50% align:center
He'd be too afraid to.

00:05:16.316 --> 00:05:18.735 position:50% align:center
[CONRAD]
You should see this. Sorry.

00:05:20.987 --> 00:05:23.656 position:50% align:center
[SISSEL GRAUER]
I might faint.

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:27.369 position:50% align:center
My brother. He raised me,
all by himself.

00:05:27.452 --> 00:05:28.912 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO gasps]

00:05:28.995 --> 00:05:30.789 position:50% align:center
[SISSEL GRAUER]
After our parents passed,

00:05:30.872 --> 00:05:33.792 position:50% align:center
he worked so hard
to provide for us.

00:05:33.875 --> 00:05:36.086 position:50% align:center
He paid to put me
through school.

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:37.837 position:50% align:center
I can't believe he would--

00:05:37.921 --> 00:05:39.214 position:50% align:center
[ZAITZ'S LITTLE BROTHER]
Welcome home!

00:05:39.297 --> 00:05:40.840 position:50% align:center
[ZAITZ'S YOUNGER SISTER]
Big brother, you're home!

00:05:40.924 --> 00:05:42.926 position:50% align:center
Hi! Did you miss me?

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:44.344 position:50% align:center
[ZAITZ'S LITTLE SISTER]
Tell me a story!

00:05:44.427 --> 00:05:46.179 position:50% align:center
[ZAITZ'S LITTLE BROTHER]
We've been waiting for you.

00:05:47.931 --> 00:05:49.683 position:50% align:center
[ZAITZ'S LITTLE SISTER]
Hey, guess what?

00:05:49.766 --> 00:05:51.601 position:50% align:center
I did lots of helping today!

00:05:51.685 --> 00:05:53.353 position:50% align:center
Wow! Well, I'm really
proud of you!

00:05:53.436 --> 00:05:55.188 position:50% align:center
It wasn't just her,
I helped, too!

00:05:55.271 --> 00:05:57.107 position:50% align:center
[ZAITZ]
You did? Good job!

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:59.234 position:50% align:center
And the neighbors asked me
to help them tomorrow!

00:05:59.317 --> 00:06:01.236 position:50% align:center
You swear you're not fibbing?

00:06:03.488 --> 00:06:05.532 position:50% align:center
[SISSEL GRAUER]
My brother is very timid,

00:06:05.615 --> 00:06:07.367 position:50% align:center
so much so that
he avoided fights

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:09.911 position:50% align:center
'cause he always lost.

00:06:09.994 --> 00:06:12.664 position:50% align:center
And, yet, any time
I was in trouble,

00:06:12.747 --> 00:06:15.250 position:50% align:center
he always came running to help.

00:06:15.333 --> 00:06:17.752 position:50% align:center
He could never do this.

00:06:17.836 --> 00:06:20.630 position:50% align:center
I don't believe it.

00:06:20.714 --> 00:06:24.426 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, but the guy
your brother killed,

00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:26.219 position:50% align:center
he was a good friend of mine.

00:06:26.302 --> 00:06:27.345 position:50% align:center
[SISSEL GRAUER gasps]

00:06:27.429 --> 00:06:30.807 position:50% align:center
And my friend,
he provided for a family,

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:32.517 position:50% align:center
but he can't anymore.

00:06:33.393 --> 00:06:34.769 position:50% align:center
Forgive me.

00:06:34.853 --> 00:06:37.105 position:50% align:center
You see, I don't know
what kind of a guy

00:06:37.188 --> 00:06:39.399 position:50% align:center
your brother was, we never met.

00:06:39.482 --> 00:06:44.195 position:50% align:center
But, I do know a family is
suffering because of him.

00:06:47.907 --> 00:06:50.368 position:50% align:center
[CONRAD] I hate to do this,
but you'll have to accompany us

00:06:50.452 --> 00:06:53.163 position:50% align:center
to the capital as
a person of interest.

00:06:54.247 --> 00:06:55.999 position:50% align:center
[SISSEL GRAUER]
I understand.

00:06:59.669 --> 00:07:00.837 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO]
Sometimes I wonder whether

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:03.006 position:50% align:center
Innumael's really in Headkeeper.

00:07:03.089 --> 00:07:07.218 position:50% align:center
Uh-- Hey, now, you're not
going soft on me, are you?

00:07:07.302 --> 00:07:09.929 position:50% align:center
How do you know that girl
was even telling the truth?

00:07:10.013 --> 00:07:12.182 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO] I don't know
anything for certain.

00:07:13.183 --> 00:07:14.768 position:50% align:center
That said, based on his file

00:07:14.851 --> 00:07:17.312 position:50% align:center
and everything his sister
said about him,

00:07:17.395 --> 00:07:19.731 position:50% align:center
I can't help but feel like
he's not the type.

00:07:19.814 --> 00:07:21.900 position:50% align:center
Why would he throw
in with smugglers?

00:07:30.033 --> 00:07:33.620 position:50% align:center
[ELFRIEDE] That's quite
a salty mug you've got on.

00:07:33.703 --> 00:07:36.373 position:50% align:center
If you don't like it,
don't eat it.

00:07:36.456 --> 00:07:38.583 position:50% align:center
Let's just get down to business.

00:07:40.669 --> 00:07:41.878 position:50% align:center
[ELFRIEDE]
What's this?

00:07:41.961 --> 00:07:43.296 position:50% align:center
[FRITZ]
Of all the facilities run by

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:44.964 position:50% align:center
the Bureau of
Disease Prevention,

00:07:45.048 --> 00:07:47.550 position:50% align:center
we found one that
struck us as suspicious.

00:07:47.634 --> 00:07:49.344 position:50% align:center
It's a mental institution
that shut down

00:07:49.427 --> 00:07:51.388 position:50% align:center
twelve or thirteen years ago.

00:07:51.471 --> 00:07:54.140 position:50% align:center
But apparently, people have been
coming and going from there,

00:07:54.224 --> 00:07:57.227 position:50% align:center
starting around the time
HK became more active.

00:07:57.310 --> 00:07:59.729 position:50% align:center
You'll infiltrate
the place with that.

00:07:59.813 --> 00:08:00.939 position:50% align:center
Find out where the money's going

00:08:01.022 --> 00:08:03.775 position:50% align:center
and the identity of
the traitor responsible.

00:08:04.901 --> 00:08:07.404 position:50% align:center
[FRITZ]
Eat the rest if you want.

00:08:10.281 --> 00:08:13.118 position:50% align:center
That guy pisses me off!

00:08:25.171 --> 00:08:27.799 position:50% align:center
Something's definitely going on.

00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:05.628 position:50% align:center
[ELFRIEDE]
A security camera?

00:09:06.755 --> 00:09:08.465 position:50% align:center
[SECURITY OFFICER 04A]
Present your ID.

00:09:14.512 --> 00:09:16.139 position:50% align:center
[SECURITY OFFICER 04A]
You may proceed.

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:29.694 position:50% align:center
[RESEARCHER 04A] Could you
deliver the sample data

00:09:29.778 --> 00:09:30.945 position:50% align:center
to building B for me?

00:09:31.029 --> 00:09:32.364 position:50% align:center
[RESEARCHER 04B]
Yes, of course.

00:09:32.447 --> 00:09:33.865 position:50% align:center
[RESEARCHER 04A] Also,
could you have the next shift...

00:09:33.948 --> 00:09:35.867 position:50% align:center
It's all women.

00:09:40.914 --> 00:09:42.290 position:50% align:center

I have assembled you here to

It's a very important operation.

00:14:00.882 --> 00:14:04.427 position:50% align:center
Diet Member Mary Bult
is here to explain the details.

00:14:04.511 --> 00:14:05.970 position:50% align:center
First let me thank you.

00:14:06.054 --> 00:14:07.764 position:50% align:center
I know you all have
busy schedules,

so I appreciate your time.

00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:13.895 position:50% align:center
Now, as for the operation
the commander mentioned--

00:14:13.978 --> 00:14:15.772 position:50% align:center
As you are all well aware,

00:14:15.855 --> 00:14:17.941 position:50% align:center
ever since the Diet
prohibited the possession

00:14:18.024 --> 00:14:20.193 position:50% align:center
of Class Two
artillery or higher.

00:14:20.276 --> 00:14:22.362 position:50% align:center
Weapons smugglers have
been more active

00:14:22.445 --> 00:14:25.573 position:50% align:center
which, to be frank,
is putting it mildly.

00:14:25.657 --> 00:14:27.742 position:50% align:center
I recognize it's
natural that people

00:14:27.826 --> 00:14:31.121 position:50% align:center
wish to defend themselves,
and I know your dilemma.

00:14:31.204 --> 00:14:33.289 position:50% align:center
The military is
far too short-handed

00:14:33.373 --> 00:14:35.583 position:50% align:center
to protect every region.

00:14:35.667 --> 00:14:38.545 position:50% align:center
The blood of the people of
the Empire cannot be shed.

00:14:38.628 --> 00:14:40.880 position:50% align:center
Not a single drop.

00:14:40.964 --> 00:14:45.593 position:50% align:center
However, weapons can't reach
the hands of anti-imperialists,

00:14:45.677 --> 00:14:47.721 position:50% align:center
lest they raise their
banner of revolution,

00:14:47.804 --> 00:14:49.806 position:50% align:center
causing strife and chaos!

00:14:49.889 --> 00:14:52.642 position:50% align:center
In short, what are
you proposing we do?

00:14:52.726 --> 00:14:55.311 position:50% align:center
We'll quash the largest
of terrorist factions

00:14:55.395 --> 00:14:57.647 position:50% align:center

00:14:57.731 --> 00:14:59.858 position:50% align:center

operations in the capital.

will work together

00:15:13.079 --> 00:15:16.583 position:50% align:center
in a joint operation to
round up Headkeeper!

more difficult than I thought.

00:15:32.349 --> 00:15:34.017 position:50% align:center
[ELFRIEDE] This means
that Headkeeper's profits

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:36.227 position:50% align:center
are being funneled
here directly.

00:15:36.311 --> 00:15:40.023 position:50% align:center
But who's doing it, and why?

00:15:40.106 --> 00:15:42.317 position:50% align:center
Who's in charge of this place?

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:44.110 position:50% align:center
This says Mary Bult.

00:15:44.194 --> 00:15:47.655 position:50% align:center
Seriously? Like,
the Diet Member?

00:15:52.285 --> 00:15:55.038 position:50% align:center
[ELFRIEDE] That means Headkeeper
money is directly profiting.

00:15:55.121 --> 00:15:56.581 position:50% align:center
This is huge!

00:15:56.664 --> 00:16:00.293 position:50% align:center

what they're doing?

00:16:36.413 --> 00:16:38.957 position:50% align:center

00:19:36.217 --> 00:19:38.428 position:50% align:center
What else should I expect from
a bastard born of

00:19:38.511 --> 00:19:40.138 position:50% align:center
such a base woman?

00:19:40.221 --> 00:19:41.306 position:50% align:center
It makes my stomach turn

00:19:41.389 --> 00:19:43.850 position:50% align:center
to think that cretin
shares my blood.

00:19:43.933 --> 00:19:46.353 position:50% align:center
[HELMAN'S MOM]
Please forgive me, Master.

00:19:50.982 --> 00:19:53.234 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN 04A]
Can you believe this?

00:19:54.611 --> 00:19:57.614 position:50% align:center
[SERVANT 04A] To think
she'd jump in the river.

00:19:57.697 --> 00:20:00.992 position:50% align:center
[SERVANT 04A] She was apparently
stealing from the master.

00:20:01.076 --> 00:20:02.118 position:50% align:center
[SERVANT 04B]
It makes sense.

00:20:02.202 --> 00:20:04.621 position:50% align:center
They say she was
in considerable debt.

00:20:23.723 --> 00:20:25.433 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN 04B groans]

00:20:33.358 --> 00:20:38.113 position:50% align:center
[panting]

00:20:41.908 --> 00:20:47.539 position:50% align:center
[WALTER groans]
But why, though?

00:20:55.463 --> 00:21:02.345 position:50% align:center
[ADELINA crying]

00:21:03.596 --> 00:21:04.848 position:50% align:center
[HERSCHEL]
Unhand me!

00:21:04.931 --> 00:21:08.351 position:50% align:center
Do you fools have
any idea who I am?

00:21:08.435 --> 00:21:11.438 position:50% align:center
I order you to
unhand me right now!

00:21:13.023 --> 00:21:13.857 position:50% align:center
I didn't do it!

00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:15.567 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER 04C]
Don't resist!

00:21:15.650 --> 00:21:17.235 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER 04B]
Come quietly!

00:21:18.445 --> 00:21:20.780 position:50% align:center
Can you believe the master
was the serial killer?

00:21:20.864 --> 00:21:22.907 position:50% align:center
We could have
ended up murdered, too!

00:21:22.991 --> 00:21:24.576 position:50% align:center
[SERVANT 04D]
No, we weren't his type.

00:21:24.659 --> 00:21:28.288 position:50% align:center
The military police say he
killed over 20 prostitutes.

00:21:30.832 --> 00:21:33.418 position:50% align:center
I shall be the first to
relish the look on his face

00:21:33.501 --> 00:21:36.421 position:50% align:center
as he crumbles before me and his
soul is ripped from his body,

00:21:36.504 --> 00:21:37.839 position:50% align:center
as the light fades
from his eyes,

00:21:37.922 --> 00:21:40.842 position:50% align:center
as payment for the
pain he's caused--

00:21:41.968 --> 00:21:44.304 position:50% align:center
The pleasure will be all mine.

00:21:44.387 --> 00:21:47.057 position:50% align:center
No one else's, only mine.

00:21:50.935 --> 00:21:52.854 position:50% align:center
[INNUMAEL]
Why did we stop here, exactly?

00:21:52.937 --> 00:21:54.314 position:50% align:center
[ARNOLT]
I told you.

00:21:54.397 --> 00:21:57.150 position:50% align:center
We need to prepare before
heading into Gutheil Domain.

00:21:57.233 --> 00:22:00.779 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but is this
necessary? Ugh.

00:22:02.489 --> 00:22:05.158 position:50% align:center
I gotta say, man,
that suits you!

00:22:07.452 --> 00:22:09.996 position:50% align:center
[KLAUS] Yeah, maybe he should
go ahead and join an order!

00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:13.917 position:50% align:center
[KLAUS laughing]

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.460 position:50% align:center
[KLAUS whistles]

00:22:15.543 --> 00:22:17.253 position:50% align:center
[INNUMAEL] Why are you
wearing a disguise?

00:22:17.337 --> 00:22:20.423 position:50% align:center
Your face isn't on
any wanted posters.

00:22:20.507 --> 00:22:23.551 position:50% align:center
Schaake isn't
wearing a disguise.

00:22:23.635 --> 00:22:26.513 position:50% align:center
She's a bona fide member
of the Gutheil noble family.

00:22:26.596 --> 00:22:28.515 position:50% align:center
That's just how they dress.

00:22:29.516 --> 00:22:31.351 position:50% align:center
No way.
