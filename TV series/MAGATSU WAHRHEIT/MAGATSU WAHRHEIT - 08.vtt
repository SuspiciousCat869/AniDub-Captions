00:02:06.751 --> 00:02:08.545 position:50% align:center
We shouldn't hang out
here too long.

00:02:08.628 --> 00:02:12.215 position:50% align:center
There's coldfire right in
the middle of the capital?

00:02:12.298 --> 00:02:13.925 position:50% align:center
And the military knew about it?

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:16.553 position:50% align:center
The higher ups did, most likely.

00:02:16.636 --> 00:02:19.264 position:50% align:center
I found out when we got here.

00:02:19.347 --> 00:02:23.059 position:50% align:center
You guys are the worst!
How can you be so calm about it?

00:02:23.143 --> 00:02:24.394 position:50% align:center
Hey, don't blame me.

00:02:24.477 --> 00:02:26.980 position:50% align:center
Us grunts only get told
on a need-to-know basis.

00:02:27.063 --> 00:02:28.481 position:50% align:center
I'd have gone my
whole life not knowing

00:02:28.565 --> 00:02:31.317 position:50% align:center
if you hadn't tried to
hide in this hell hole.

00:02:32.402 --> 00:02:34.029 position:50% align:center
We can fight about it later.

00:02:34.112 --> 00:02:36.865 position:50% align:center
But right now, we need to focus
on getting the hell out of here.

00:02:36.948 --> 00:02:39.701 position:50% align:center
[INNUMAEL]
Okay, fine. You're right.

00:02:39.784 --> 00:02:43.830 position:50% align:center
It's just, I guess I want
a more satisfying explanation.

00:02:43.913 --> 00:02:46.875 position:50% align:center
--Now that I know, how can I--
--Hey, check it out.

00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:49.210 position:50% align:center
That looks like it leads to
the surface, doesn't it?

00:02:49.294 --> 00:02:51.880 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Looks that way.

00:02:53.923 --> 00:02:55.675 position:50% align:center
Let's give it a go.

00:02:56.926 --> 00:02:58.219 position:50% align:center
[HELMAN]
Well, then?

00:02:58.303 --> 00:02:59.596 position:50% align:center
Have you come across
anything of interest?

00:02:59.679 --> 00:03:00.847 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO]
Yes, sir.

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.599 position:50% align:center
There's an incredible
amount of blood here.

00:03:02.682 --> 00:03:04.726 position:50% align:center
I see soot, as well.

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:06.895 position:50% align:center
[HELMAN] From the explosion
we heard earlier?

00:03:06.978 --> 00:03:10.273 position:50% align:center
Yes. I believe this must
be the site of the blast.

00:03:10.357 --> 00:03:12.984 position:50% align:center
And judging from the
sheer volume of blood,

00:03:13.068 --> 00:03:15.153 position:50% align:center
someone was either
severely injured or perished

00:03:15.236 --> 00:03:17.405 position:50% align:center
as a result of said blast.

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:19.532 position:50% align:center
So, what now?

00:03:19.616 --> 00:03:22.494 position:50% align:center
[HELMAN] Huh. Well,
it's highly unlikely that

00:03:22.577 --> 00:03:24.954 position:50% align:center
the explosion took them all out,

00:03:25.038 --> 00:03:27.791 position:50% align:center
which means that they
either vacated the area,

00:03:27.874 --> 00:03:30.418 position:50% align:center
or they fell down
to the lower levels.

00:03:32.462 --> 00:03:33.213 position:50% align:center
[HELMAN]
Leo.

00:03:33.296 --> 00:03:34.673 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir?

00:03:34.756 --> 00:03:37.717 position:50% align:center
I want you to search for a path
into the lower chambers.

00:03:37.801 --> 00:03:39.636 position:50% align:center
There must be some way down.

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:41.096 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO]
And what about you?

00:03:41.179 --> 00:03:43.640 position:50% align:center
I'll meet up with Morra,
and see if he's found anything.

00:03:43.723 --> 00:03:45.183 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO]
Copy that, sir.

00:03:47.143 --> 00:03:51.564 position:50% align:center
Are you sure this is the place?
The emergency rendezvous point?

00:03:51.648 --> 00:03:53.024 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:03:53.108 --> 00:03:55.652 position:50% align:center
Irma and I worked the
whole thing out beforehand.

00:03:55.735 --> 00:03:57.153 position:50% align:center
This is the spot.

00:03:57.237 --> 00:03:59.572 position:50% align:center
[BENJAMIN] Then what is that
military vehicle doing here?

00:03:59.656 --> 00:04:00.573 position:50% align:center
[ARNOLT]
Good question.

00:04:00.657 --> 00:04:02.117 position:50% align:center
[BENJAMIN]
Arnolt--

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.328 position:50% align:center
[ARNOLT] I mean, look.
Irma's van is here, too!

00:04:05.412 --> 00:04:07.831 position:50% align:center
[BENJAMIN]
Oh! Yeah, you're right.

00:04:07.914 --> 00:04:10.792 position:50% align:center
I guess the military must have
followed them all the way here.

00:04:10.875 --> 00:04:12.210 position:50% align:center
That can't be good.

00:04:12.293 --> 00:04:14.838 position:50% align:center
This doesn't sound like
the most foolproof plan, Arn.

00:04:14.921 --> 00:04:18.091 position:50% align:center
Gimme a break,
at least I had a plan.

00:04:18.174 --> 00:04:22.429 position:50% align:center
[BENJAMIN gasps]
Wait. Isn't that the car?

00:04:22.512 --> 00:04:24.389 position:50% align:center
Yeah. It is.

00:04:31.062 --> 00:04:34.566 position:50% align:center
Over there. There's a side path.

00:04:34.649 --> 00:04:36.943 position:50% align:center
I bet it'll get us
to the surface.

00:04:37.027 --> 00:04:38.737 position:50% align:center
[INNUMAEL]
Yeah, I've heard that before.

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.782 position:50% align:center
[CONRAD] Shut up. Why do you
have to be so pessimistic?

00:04:42.866 --> 00:04:47.495 position:50% align:center
We've been down here too long.
We have to get away, somehow.

00:04:47.579 --> 00:04:48.955 position:50% align:center
[INNUMAEL]
Luminosis--

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:50.123 position:50% align:center

Hold on.

00:04:54.044 --> 00:04:55.962 position:50% align:center
[HELMAN]
Hello, Conrad.

00:04:56.046 --> 00:04:58.590 position:50% align:center
My, my, what's
the meaning of this?

00:04:58.673 --> 00:05:00.425 position:50% align:center
Am I to understand
that you're fraternizing

00:05:00.508 --> 00:05:03.011 position:50% align:center
with a member of Headkeeper?

00:05:03.094 --> 00:05:07.182 position:50% align:center
Hello, sir... Huh?

00:05:11.144 --> 00:05:12.270 position:50% align:center
Sissel!

00:05:12.354 --> 00:05:14.105 position:50% align:center

00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:16.483 position:50% align:center
[INNUMAEL]
Hang on! Why--!

00:05:16.566 --> 00:05:18.902 position:50% align:center
Why did you bring her down here?

00:05:18.985 --> 00:05:21.196 position:50% align:center
Hey! Answer me, dammit!

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:23.865 position:50% align:center
Captain. What's going--

00:05:25.325 --> 00:05:29.037 position:50% align:center
[HELMAN] Not so fast, Conrad.
I will ask you once again.

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.497 position:50% align:center
What are you doing fraternizing

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:32.957 position:50% align:center
with a member of
a criminal organization?

00:05:33.041 --> 00:05:36.670 position:50% align:center
Sir, I'm sorry, but... given the
situation, I thought that--

00:05:36.753 --> 00:05:40.465 position:50% align:center
[HELMAN] Conrad, Conrad, Conrad,
this simply will not do.

00:05:40.548 --> 00:05:43.343 position:50% align:center
Do you think this choice
befits an Imperial Soldier?

00:05:43.426 --> 00:05:44.427 position:50% align:center
[CONRAD]
Sir--?

00:05:44.511 --> 00:05:46.221 position:50% align:center
[HELMAN]
I cannot adequately express

00:05:46.304 --> 00:05:50.433 position:50% align:center
how much I detest
criminality in any form.

00:05:50.517 --> 00:05:52.394 position:50% align:center
You're already
well aware of that.

00:05:52.477 --> 00:05:53.728 position:50% align:center
And yet, here you are,

00:05:53.812 --> 00:05:56.940 position:50% align:center
allowing this undeserving
cretin his freedom.

00:05:57.023 --> 00:05:59.484 position:50% align:center
[CONRAD] I'm truly sorry, sir,
but given the fact that

00:05:59.567 --> 00:06:01.069 position:50% align:center
one of the monsters
from the city is--

00:06:01.152 --> 00:06:03.613 position:50% align:center
Execute the criminal.

00:06:03.697 --> 00:06:05.365 position:50% align:center
This trash deserves no mercy.

00:06:05.448 --> 00:06:06.282 position:50% align:center
Dispose of him.

[gasps]

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.369 position:50% align:center
Sir! Don't do this!

00:06:09.452 --> 00:06:11.705 position:50% align:center
He may have valuable
information we need.

00:06:11.788 --> 00:06:14.249 position:50% align:center
Shouldn't we follow
legal procedure--?

00:06:23.466 --> 00:06:29.723 position:50% align:center
[CONRAD, INNUMAEL coughing]

00:06:29.806 --> 00:06:31.391 position:50% align:center

Morra. Now.

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:33.518 position:50% align:center
Yes!

00:06:35.145 --> 00:06:36.396 position:50% align:center

Stop, please!

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:40.108 position:50% align:center
She has nothing to do
with this! Don't hurt her.

00:06:43.445 --> 00:06:46.364 position:50% align:center
Please, sir. Don't do this.

00:06:46.448 --> 00:06:47.699 position:50% align:center
The higher-ups
will never let you

00:06:47.782 --> 00:06:49.868 position:50% align:center
get away with only a reprimand.

00:06:49.951 --> 00:06:52.120 position:50% align:center
They'll never find out
if no one tells them.

00:06:52.203 --> 00:06:56.833 position:50% align:center
[CONRAD gasps]
But sir, this is a violation.

00:06:56.916 --> 00:06:59.377 position:50% align:center
If need be,
I'll report you myself.

00:06:59.461 --> 00:07:02.464 position:50% align:center
Then I suppose I need
to keep you quiet, too.

If I were to fall from here,

00:07:19.564 --> 00:07:22.525 position:50% align:center
would you promise
to spare my sister?

[HELMAN]
Hmph.

00:07:24.277 --> 00:07:28.365 position:50% align:center
Yes. I would guarantee your
sister's safety in that case.

00:07:28.448 --> 00:07:30.075 position:50% align:center

You'd keep your word?

00:20:19.719 --> 00:20:22.806 position:50% align:center
But how do you think we get
the goods out of the capital?

00:20:23.682 --> 00:20:24.849 position:50% align:center
[SCHAAKE] And where
do you think the funding

00:20:24.933 --> 00:20:26.935 position:50% align:center
for our operations comes from?

00:20:27.018 --> 00:20:28.937 position:50% align:center
I don't know.

00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:30.397 position:50% align:center
[SCHAAKE]
The Imperial Army budgets

00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:32.649 position:50% align:center
vast sums to defend the capital,

00:20:32.732 --> 00:20:33.817 position:50% align:center
but they ignore the other cities

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:36.820 position:50% align:center
and fail to maintain
basic public safety!

00:20:36.903 --> 00:20:38.780 position:50% align:center
So, in some places,
Headkeeper has

00:20:38.863 --> 00:20:42.033 position:50% align:center
a way better reputation
than the military.

00:20:45.704 --> 00:20:47.706 position:50% align:center
[SCHAAKE] There are high-ranking
military officials

00:20:47.789 --> 00:20:51.501 position:50% align:center
who exploit Headkeeper's
crimes for personal gain.

00:20:51.584 --> 00:20:54.796 position:50% align:center
I won't argue that what we're
doing is true justice.

00:20:54.879 --> 00:20:57.298 position:50% align:center
Even so, we're fighting
for the people,

00:20:57.382 --> 00:21:01.094 position:50% align:center
and the rotten military has
all but forgotten its citizens.

00:21:01.177 --> 00:21:02.679 position:50% align:center
What?

00:21:02.762 --> 00:21:05.056 position:50% align:center
Did you think the military was a
sacred organization that fought

00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:07.183 position:50% align:center
for the weak and
punished the powerful?

00:21:07.267 --> 00:21:08.852 position:50% align:center
That's enough.
Let's pause there.

00:21:08.935 --> 00:21:11.563 position:50% align:center
No need for all that. Right?

00:21:11.646 --> 00:21:14.691 position:50% align:center
Now then, more importantly,
what are you gonna do?

00:21:14.774 --> 00:21:16.901 position:50% align:center
You did kill an officer.

00:21:16.985 --> 00:21:19.029 position:50% align:center
I don't know.

00:21:19.112 --> 00:21:21.865 position:50% align:center
You want to come with us?

00:21:25.618 --> 00:21:27.120 position:50% align:center
I, uh--

00:21:27.203 --> 00:21:30.707 position:50% align:center
[CONRAD] Well, there's not much
to be done about that, is there?

00:21:31.624 --> 00:21:33.418 position:50% align:center
It's just like someone said.

00:21:33.501 --> 00:21:36.212 position:50% align:center
They won't find out
if no one tells them, right?

00:21:36.296 --> 00:21:39.174 position:50% align:center
[IRMA laughs]
You're a pretty funny guy.

00:21:39.257 --> 00:21:41.634 position:50% align:center
So, if you want my opinion,

00:21:41.718 --> 00:21:44.429 position:50% align:center
I think it would be best to
cooperate with these people.

00:21:44.512 --> 00:21:45.680 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:21:45.764 --> 00:21:47.057 position:50% align:center
[CONRAD] I mean,
it's not like you can just

00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:49.017 position:50% align:center
forget everything
you heard in there.

00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:52.979 position:50% align:center
So, I'm thinking, why not
investigate in your own way?

00:21:53.063 --> 00:21:55.106 position:50% align:center
Besides, as Imperial Soldiers,

00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:57.317 position:50% align:center
you could argue that
we're perfect for the job.

00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:59.986 position:50% align:center
They can't move around
the capital like we can.

00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:01.363 position:50% align:center
What do you say?

00:22:05.075 --> 00:22:07.410 position:50% align:center
From my experience,
I can tell you

00:22:07.494 --> 00:22:10.622 position:50% align:center
the only choice is to
let yourself get dragged in.

00:22:14.459 --> 00:22:17.962 position:50% align:center
Okay, then! Good to
have you on board!

00:22:19.547 --> 00:22:23.343 position:50% align:center
[sighs] Don't think this means
that I've forgiven you.

00:22:23.426 --> 00:22:25.762 position:50% align:center
Uh... [chuckles]

00:22:25.845 --> 00:22:28.306 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO]
Once this is over.

00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:31.017 position:50% align:center
I will make you
take responsibility.

00:22:32.143 --> 00:22:33.520 position:50% align:center
