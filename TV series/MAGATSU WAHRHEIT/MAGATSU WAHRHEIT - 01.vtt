00:00:36.661 --> 00:00:39.289 position:50% align:center
A prophecy of the dawn.

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:35.512 position:50% align:center
[MARIE]
Mutant activity has increased

00:01:35.595 --> 00:01:37.305 position:50% align:center
considerably in recent weeks.

00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:39.683 position:50% align:center
Because of this,
large volumes of firearms

00:01:39.766 --> 00:01:41.518 position:50% align:center
are circulating
outside the capital,

00:01:41.601 --> 00:01:44.145 position:50% align:center
in every city and village.

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:46.189 position:50% align:center
An increase in crime
complicates things,

00:01:46.272 --> 00:01:48.692 position:50% align:center
as well, and rumors
of growing discontent

00:01:48.775 --> 00:01:51.277 position:50% align:center
toward the empire among
the regional nobility

00:01:51.361 --> 00:01:52.862 position:50% align:center
have been spreading.

00:01:52.946 --> 00:01:55.824 position:50% align:center
We have also received
reports that in some cities,

00:01:55.907 --> 00:01:57.367 position:50% align:center
protests among the populace have

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.911 position:50% align:center
progressed to the
verge of all-out riots.

00:01:59.994 --> 00:02:02.372 position:50% align:center
Reports say the most
radical of these agitators

00:02:02.455 --> 00:02:04.666 position:50% align:center
have banded together and
organized themselves

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:08.086 position:50% align:center
into a fully armed
terrorist cell.

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:09.796 position:50% align:center
In response to
these developments,

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:13.383 position:50% align:center
I offer two proposals
for consideration.

00:02:13.466 --> 00:02:15.844 position:50% align:center
First, I recommend
a full-scale expansion

00:02:15.927 --> 00:02:19.472 position:50% align:center
of the military in conjunction
with defense of the realm.

00:02:19.556 --> 00:02:22.058 position:50% align:center
Second, a ban on
civilian possession of

00:02:22.142 --> 00:02:24.477 position:50% align:center
class two heavy
artillery or higher.

00:02:24.561 --> 00:02:26.438 position:50% align:center
As representative of the Diet,

00:02:26.521 --> 00:02:29.024 position:50% align:center
Your Majesty,
I beseech you to present

00:02:29.107 --> 00:02:31.359 position:50% align:center
your decision on these matters.

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:57.260 position:50% align:center
[yawns] Morning.

00:02:57.344 --> 00:02:59.846 position:50% align:center
Hey. You're up
early today, huh, Leo?

00:02:59.929 --> 00:03:01.681 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I want to be sharp.

00:03:01.765 --> 00:03:05.101 position:50% align:center
It is my first day as an
imperial soldier, after all!

00:03:05.185 --> 00:03:07.979 position:50% align:center
Quite a big step up from
a measly shoe shiner!

00:03:08.063 --> 00:03:09.481 position:50% align:center
[ZAITZ]
Your first day as a trainee.

00:03:09.564 --> 00:03:12.192 position:50% align:center
Come on, I don't wanna
burden you forever.

00:03:12.275 --> 00:03:13.526 position:50% align:center
I gotta grow up sometime.

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.570 position:50% align:center
Oh, you're responsible now?

00:03:15.653 --> 00:03:18.114 position:50% align:center
Well, get the little ones
ready before you go.

00:03:18.198 --> 00:03:19.657 position:50% align:center
You got it.

00:03:19.741 --> 00:03:21.993 position:50% align:center
Wait, do you seriously have to
go in to work this morning?

00:03:22.077 --> 00:03:25.121 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Bye. See you at
the guardhouse later.

00:03:25.205 --> 00:03:27.540 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO] You really need to
quit all these side jobs.

00:03:27.624 --> 00:03:29.084 position:50% align:center
[ZAITZ chuckles]

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:24.741 position:50% align:center
Hey, we're getting together
again this weekend.

00:05:24.824 --> 00:05:26.826 position:50% align:center
You better be joining us, 'kay?

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:30.413 position:50% align:center
[INNUMAEL] I'll pass.
You can play without me.

00:05:30.497 --> 00:05:32.749 position:50% align:center
[WORKER 01A chuckles]
You still sore about

00:05:32.832 --> 00:05:35.043 position:50% align:center
losing your whole
paycheck last time?

00:05:35.126 --> 00:05:36.920 position:50% align:center
[chuckles] Funny.

00:05:37.003 --> 00:05:38.129 position:50% align:center
Ah, don't be a chicken.

00:05:38.213 --> 00:05:40.465 position:50% align:center
Everybody loses
every once in a while.

00:05:40.548 --> 00:05:42.384 position:50% align:center
This is why you always get--

00:05:42.467 --> 00:05:44.886 position:50% align:center
Oh, shit, shit,
shit, shit, shit.

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:48.223 position:50% align:center
[SUPERVISOR 01A] Slacking off
on the job and gambling, huh?

00:05:49.516 --> 00:05:53.186 position:50% align:center
[INNUMAEL] Ah! Boss! I, um--
you want in the game?

00:05:53.269 --> 00:05:55.271 position:50% align:center
[SUPERVISOR 01A]
As fun as that sounds, no.

00:05:55.355 --> 00:05:58.775 position:50% align:center
[INNUMAEL chuckles]
You sure? It is fun, actually.

00:05:58.858 --> 00:05:59.859 position:50% align:center
[SUPERVISOR 01A]
Do I look amused?

00:05:59.943 --> 00:06:01.319 position:50% align:center
Get those boxes
loaded and get going!

00:06:01.403 --> 00:06:04.447 position:50% align:center
Uh, yes, sir! Got it!
Sorry, sir.

00:06:04.531 --> 00:06:05.615 position:50% align:center
[SUPERVISOR 01A]
Idiot.

00:06:08.368 --> 00:06:11.371 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO] 'Scuse me.
Would you like some help?

00:06:15.667 --> 00:06:18.086 position:50% align:center
The cargo's already
inside the building.

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:20.463 position:50% align:center
Once it's secured,
use the camouflaged truck

00:06:20.547 --> 00:06:22.298 position:50% align:center
that's waiting in
the parking lot.

00:06:22.382 --> 00:06:24.050 position:50% align:center
That's all I've got for you.

00:06:24.134 --> 00:06:25.343 position:50% align:center
Get it done.

00:06:27.679 --> 00:06:29.723 position:50% align:center
Right, one of you'll wait
in the back of the truck.

00:06:29.806 --> 00:06:32.726 position:50% align:center
Then, I'll need two groups of
two to find the package.

00:06:32.809 --> 00:06:34.144 position:50% align:center
Dibs on the truck.

00:06:34.227 --> 00:06:37.272 position:50% align:center
Great. Hey, Schaake,
wanna team up and have some fun?

00:06:37.355 --> 00:06:39.858 position:50% align:center
[ARNOLD] Figure it out.
We're wasting time here.

00:06:39.941 --> 00:06:41.526 position:50% align:center
[CLAUS gasps]
Schaake!

00:06:51.453 --> 00:06:55.040 position:50% align:center
[INNUMAEL]
And there. All done.

00:06:55.123 --> 00:06:57.208 position:50% align:center
Sorry for taking up
so much of your time.

00:06:57.292 --> 00:07:00.337 position:50% align:center
Nah. Heavy lifting?
My specialty.

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:01.629 position:50% align:center
And, no offence,
but you don't really

00:07:01.713 --> 00:07:03.590 position:50% align:center
strike me as the athletic type.

00:07:03.673 --> 00:07:05.550 position:50% align:center
[INNUMAEL chuckles]
No joke.

00:07:05.633 --> 00:07:07.844 position:50% align:center
You're pretty jolly,
for a soldier, I mean.

00:07:07.927 --> 00:07:10.889 position:50% align:center
Yeah? That must be 'cause
today's my first day.

00:07:10.972 --> 00:07:14.184 position:50% align:center
Oh, really? Well,
congratulations, man!

00:07:14.267 --> 00:07:15.352 position:50% align:center
I'm always at work,

00:07:15.435 --> 00:07:17.103 position:50% align:center
so we'll probably
see each other around.

00:07:17.187 --> 00:07:18.855 position:50% align:center
Name's Innumael.

00:07:18.938 --> 00:07:20.648 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO]
I'm Leocadio.

00:07:20.732 --> 00:07:23.360 position:50% align:center
[SUPERVISOR 01A]
Innumael! Get over here!

00:07:23.443 --> 00:07:25.904 position:50% align:center
Ah! Crap. Well, thanks again!

00:07:25.987 --> 00:07:27.197 position:50% align:center
Good luck with the new job!

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:28.865 position:50% align:center
[SUPERVISOR 01A]
Sometime today, please!

00:07:28.948 --> 00:07:30.450 position:50% align:center
[INNUMAEL]
Coming! Coming!

00:07:32.077 --> 00:07:34.412 position:50% align:center
[ZAITZ]
Leo! Quit wasting time!

00:07:34.496 --> 00:07:35.914 position:50% align:center
We got somewhere to be!

00:07:35.997 --> 00:07:36.998 position:50% align:center
Okay!

00:07:39.959 --> 00:07:42.504 position:50% align:center
Uh... What's that?

00:07:54.474 --> 00:07:56.059 position:50% align:center
[ZAITZ]
What were you doing over there?

00:07:56.142 --> 00:07:58.311 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO] Oh, that?
Just lending a hand.

00:07:58.395 --> 00:07:59.646 position:50% align:center
We still have plenty of time.

00:07:59.729 --> 00:08:02.482 position:50% align:center
Idiot. You trying to be
late your first day?

00:08:02.565 --> 00:08:04.776 position:50% align:center
You're gonna get me
in trouble. Jeez.

00:08:04.859 --> 00:08:06.403 position:50% align:center
So, what's the commander like?

00:08:06.486 --> 00:08:09.447 position:50% align:center
Huh. Well, he's a good person.

00:08:09.531 --> 00:08:11.783 position:50% align:center
He's mild-mannered and
kind to his subordinates.

00:08:11.866 --> 00:08:14.160 position:50% align:center
Why do I feel like that's
not the whole truth?

00:08:14.244 --> 00:08:16.996 position:50% align:center
Fine. I guess you'll
see for yourself.

00:08:39.769 --> 00:08:42.105 position:50% align:center
[SCHAAKE]
Why can't we find it?

00:08:42.188 --> 00:08:44.441 position:50% align:center
So, are we totally sure
it came in today?

00:08:44.524 --> 00:08:46.067 position:50% align:center
Yeah, no question.

00:08:46.151 --> 00:08:49.571 position:50% align:center
It has got to be
around here somewhere.

00:08:49.654 --> 00:08:51.406 position:50% align:center
--Excuse me, sir?
--[SUPERVISOR 01A] Yes?

00:08:51.489 --> 00:08:53.158 position:50% align:center
[CLAUS]
Hey, what are you thinking?

00:08:53.241 --> 00:08:55.452 position:50% align:center
Go with it.

00:08:55.535 --> 00:08:58.204 position:50% align:center
I'm looking for a package
that was delivered today.

00:08:58.288 --> 00:08:59.539 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:08:59.622 --> 00:09:01.541 position:50% align:center
[SCHAAKE]
It's this one right here.

00:09:02.792 --> 00:09:09.341 position:50% align:center
That's strange. Doesn't seem
to be here, does it.

00:09:09.424 --> 00:09:11.176 position:50% align:center
If I had to take a wild guess,

00:09:11.259 --> 00:09:14.262 position:50% align:center
I'd say an employee
loaded it up by mistake.

00:09:18.683 --> 00:09:20.977 position:50% align:center
You got any idea
where it might have gone?

00:09:21.061 --> 00:09:22.771 position:50% align:center
[SUPERVISOR 01A]
Hang on, lemme see.

00:09:22.854 --> 00:09:25.523 position:50% align:center
Huh. Bear with me.

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:31.946 position:50% align:center
[HELMAN]
All right, then.

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:34.699 position:50% align:center
Zaitz, I'll leave Leocadio's
training in your hands.

00:09:34.783 --> 00:09:36.743 position:50% align:center
[ZAITZ]
Yes, sir. Understood.

00:09:36.826 --> 00:09:41.498 position:50% align:center
Leocadio, huh? Leo.

00:09:41.581 --> 00:09:42.749 position:50% align:center
Yes?

00:09:42.832 --> 00:09:45.126 position:50% align:center
[HELMAN] Your enlistment
ceremony is next week.

00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:46.795 position:50% align:center
It's for the new
recruits of squads

00:09:46.878 --> 00:09:49.464 position:50% align:center
five, eight, twelve,
and thirteen.

00:09:49.547 --> 00:09:51.007 position:50% align:center
I want to see that
you've learned the ropes

00:09:51.091 --> 00:09:52.884 position:50% align:center
from Zaitz by then.

00:09:52.967 --> 00:09:54.386 position:50% align:center
Yes! You will, sir!

00:09:54.469 --> 00:09:58.640 position:50% align:center
[HELMAN] Good. Oh,
and this part bears repeating.

00:09:58.723 --> 00:09:59.849 position:50% align:center
I'm sure you're all aware of

00:09:59.933 --> 00:10:02.477 position:50% align:center
the smuggling group
called Headkeeper, yes?

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:05.480 position:50% align:center
For some reason, they've become
increasingly active lately,

00:10:05.563 --> 00:10:07.857 position:50% align:center
and a lot more extreme, as well.

00:10:07.941 --> 00:10:11.778 position:50% align:center
For instance, they attacked
a transport unit the other day.

00:10:11.861 --> 00:10:13.071 position:50% align:center
So, I want you all
to stay vigilant

00:10:13.154 --> 00:10:15.073 position:50% align:center
as you go about your duties.

00:10:15.156 --> 00:10:17.701 position:50% align:center
Right. That's it. Dismissed.

00:10:21.496 --> 00:10:25.041 position:50% align:center
Huh? Perfect spot for a break.

00:10:31.506 --> 00:10:34.217 position:50% align:center
This is a nightmare.
We cannot lose that cargo.

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:35.927 position:50% align:center
So, did you find out
where it's headed?

00:10:36.011 --> 00:10:38.138 position:50% align:center
Schaake's working on it now.

00:10:38.221 --> 00:10:39.723 position:50% align:center
As for which truck it's on,

00:10:39.806 --> 00:10:42.976 position:50% align:center
I think we've narrowed it
down to two or three.

00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:47.063 position:50% align:center
Sounds like she's back.

00:10:47.147 --> 00:10:49.399 position:50% align:center
Damian, go ahead and
bring the van around.

00:10:49.482 --> 00:10:50.775 position:50% align:center
--[DAMIAN] Got it.
--Benjamin,

00:10:50.859 --> 00:10:53.319 position:50% align:center
ready the weapons just in case.
This could get ugly.

00:10:53.403 --> 00:10:54.446 position:50% align:center
[BENJAMIN]
Okay.

00:10:57.490 --> 00:10:58.825 position:50% align:center
[DAMIAN]
Getting the van now.

00:10:58.908 --> 00:11:00.452 position:50% align:center
[SCHAAKE]
Yeah, thank you.

00:11:10.962 --> 00:11:11.838 position:50% align:center
[INSPECTOR 01A]
Evening, sir.

00:11:11.921 --> 00:11:14.507 position:50% align:center
Hey! Good evening!

00:11:14.591 --> 00:11:16.092 position:50% align:center
Right, then, here ya go.

00:11:16.176 --> 00:11:20.972 position:50% align:center
Thanks. Okay so,
deliveries, then. Good.

00:11:21.056 --> 00:11:24.642 position:50% align:center
Just gotta inspect your cargo
then you're good to go.

00:11:24.726 --> 00:11:26.353 position:50% align:center
Oh, is that your wife?

00:11:26.436 --> 00:11:28.229 position:50% align:center
[INNUMAEL]
Hm? Oh, haha this?

00:11:28.313 --> 00:11:29.856 position:50% align:center
No, That's my sister.

00:11:29.939 --> 00:11:34.027 position:50% align:center
Good kid, and she's about to
start working this year, too.

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:35.528 position:50% align:center
I'm glad.

00:11:35.612 --> 00:11:37.614 position:50% align:center

What is this?

00:11:49.959 --> 00:11:51.378 position:50% align:center
Huh? What's what?

00:11:51.461 --> 00:11:53.588 position:50% align:center
[INSPECTOR 01A]
These two boxes.

00:11:53.672 --> 00:11:56.466 position:50% align:center
I don't see them
on your list here.

00:11:56.549 --> 00:11:58.927 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna have to
open them up, okay?

[POLICE OFFICER 01A]
Innumael Grauer.

00:12:03.306 --> 00:12:04.933 position:50% align:center
So, where did you
get those weapons?

00:12:05.016 --> 00:12:06.393 position:50% align:center
Think we wouldn't notice?

00:12:06.476 --> 00:12:09.229 position:50% align:center
No, no, no, no, no.
I swear, I have no idea!

00:12:09.312 --> 00:12:10.980 position:50% align:center
This has gotta be
some big mistake!

00:12:11.064 --> 00:12:12.315 position:50% align:center
Can you check the list again?

00:12:12.399 --> 00:12:14.818 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I double checked
with the shipping company.

00:12:14.901 --> 00:12:17.821 position:50% align:center
And those weapons aren't
authorized by the Diet.

00:12:17.904 --> 00:12:20.699 position:50% align:center
You can't transport prohibited
artillery and get away with it.

[INNUMAEL]
I-- I didn't know! Honestly!

00:12:22.742 --> 00:12:24.953 position:50% align:center
Even if I believed you,
it wouldn't matter.

00:12:25.036 --> 00:12:28.915 position:50% align:center

wouldn't let me release you.

I heard the transfer
unit arrives tonight.

00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:41.594 position:50% align:center
Maybe you should start thinking
up excuses before then.

--Anything?
--Bad news.

[CLAUS sighs]
We're doing this, then?

00:13:12.208 --> 00:13:15.128 position:50% align:center
Yes, and before they
hand him to the military.

00:13:15.211 --> 00:13:16.546 position:50% align:center
So, tonight.

00:13:16.629 --> 00:13:18.757 position:50% align:center
Look, I understand that
we've gotta recover the cargo,

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:21.092 position:50% align:center
but is a jailbreak
really necessary?

If things went sideways,

00:13:22.469 --> 00:13:24.346 position:50% align:center
it'd blow the cover
off our entire operation.

00:13:24.429 --> 00:13:27.057 position:50% align:center
[SCHAAKE] We can't let an
innocent driver take the blame.

We are partly responsible
for his predicament, after all.

our necks out for him?

00:13:46.659 --> 00:13:48.119 position:50% align:center

I did.

00:14:02.217 --> 00:14:04.761 position:50% align:center
Somebody said half of them
were wiped out by monsters,

00:14:04.844 --> 00:14:07.555 position:50% align:center
and the ones who did made it
back were messed up pretty bad.

00:14:07.639 --> 00:14:09.099 position:50% align:center
Did you say monsters?

00:14:09.182 --> 00:14:12.519 position:50% align:center
[CONRAD] Yeah. Incidents have
been on the rise lately.

00:14:12.602 --> 00:14:15.188 position:50% align:center
They don't know why,
but apparently mutant monsters

00:14:15.271 --> 00:14:16.815 position:50% align:center
have been popping up,

00:14:16.898 --> 00:14:19.776 position:50% align:center

they're really aggressive.

And, get this.

Uh, well, if you
want me to guess,

I would say it was
that smuggling ring.

personally, but my men said

00:16:27.487 --> 00:16:30.824 position:50% align:center

[ARNOLD] There was a mix-up,
and somehow our cargo

was loaded onto your truck.

00:16:49.467 --> 00:16:51.511 position:50% align:center
That's why you were detained.

Well hold on a minute!

00:16:53.221 --> 00:16:55.056 position:50% align:center

there for the cargo?

--Yeah, pretty much.
--Here, have some tea.

all you have to say?

You-- You dragged me into this!

This would never have happened

our cargo by mistake.

We technically didn't
drag you into anything.

00:17:09.154 --> 00:17:10.363 position:50% align:center
That's--

00:17:11.698 --> 00:17:13.116 position:50% align:center
[DAMIAN]
For real, have some tea.

00:17:13.199 --> 00:17:14.909 position:50% align:center
Look, just hear us out.

00:17:14.993 --> 00:17:17.162 position:50% align:center
The empire's been busy
since the emperor's powers

00:17:17.245 --> 00:17:19.456 position:50% align:center
were partially
delegated to the Diet.

00:17:19.539 --> 00:17:20.874 position:50% align:center
Measures that are
highly convenient

00:17:20.957 --> 00:17:23.376 position:50% align:center
for the Diet have passed,
one after another,

00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:25.045 position:50% align:center
and in dubio contra reum

00:17:25.128 --> 00:17:27.756 position:50% align:center
has become the rule over
the last few months.

00:17:27.839 --> 00:17:30.925 position:50% align:center
If we'd left you there,
you'd've gotten a life sentence.

00:17:31.009 --> 00:17:32.969 position:50% align:center
Might've even been executed.

00:17:33.053 --> 00:17:35.013 position:50% align:center
Doesn't matter if
the charges are false or not.

00:17:35.096 --> 00:17:36.973 position:50% align:center
That's crazy.

00:17:37.057 --> 00:17:38.391 position:50% align:center

In any case.

00:17:38.475 --> 00:17:40.143 position:50% align:center
We do feel badly about it.

00:17:40.226 --> 00:17:43.772 position:50% align:center
Getting you mixed up
in this. Sorry.

00:17:50.153 --> 00:17:52.238 position:50% align:center

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:01.164 position:50% align:center
[ZAITZ]
How'd you know they'd be here,

00:18:01.247 --> 00:18:02.916 position:50% align:center
in the opposite direction
of the forest?

00:18:02.999 --> 00:18:04.542 position:50% align:center
The guard said
they went that way.

00:18:04.626 --> 00:18:06.252 position:50% align:center
When I looked at the log
for the checkpoint,

00:18:06.336 --> 00:18:07.796 position:50% align:center
I noticed a suspicious pair,

00:18:07.879 --> 00:18:09.631 position:50% align:center
and no one could
account for them.

00:18:09.714 --> 00:18:12.509 position:50% align:center
They must have been
doing reconnaissance.

00:18:12.592 --> 00:18:13.551 position:50% align:center
A group like that wouldn't do

00:18:13.635 --> 00:18:15.804 position:50% align:center
a jailbreak without
a solid plan.

00:18:15.887 --> 00:18:17.555 position:50% align:center
I figured half of the ones
who fled were decoys,

00:18:17.639 --> 00:18:19.557 position:50% align:center
meant to throw us off the track.

00:18:19.641 --> 00:18:25.563 position:50% align:center
I see. Are you okay, Leo?

00:18:25.647 --> 00:18:29.651 position:50% align:center
So will there be a battle?

00:18:32.112 --> 00:18:34.114 position:50% align:center

If anything happens,
I'll be there to protect you.

00:18:40.412 --> 00:18:41.579 position:50% align:center
Oh.

00:18:44.708 --> 00:18:47.085 position:50% align:center
It's a dream! It's not real!

00:18:47.168 --> 00:18:49.379 position:50% align:center
No good. We can't lose'm.

00:18:49.462 --> 00:18:51.297 position:50% align:center
They're about to overtake us!

00:18:51.381 --> 00:18:52.549 position:50% align:center
[BENJAMIN] Don't you think
we should prepare to

00:18:52.632 --> 00:18:55.093 position:50% align:center
engage them before
they close the distance?

00:18:55.176 --> 00:18:56.553 position:50% align:center
I mean, we do still
have the weapons

00:18:56.636 --> 00:18:58.888 position:50% align:center

[CONRAD] Wait. Looks like
they're stopping.

00:19:09.816 --> 00:19:11.151 position:50% align:center
Interesting.

00:19:11.234 --> 00:19:13.194 position:50% align:center
You don't think they're
splitting up to escape, do you?

00:19:13.278 --> 00:19:15.321 position:50% align:center
[HELMAN] No. Prepare
for battle, everyone.

artillery that was smuggled.

There's no way they
can get it through

00:19:20.201 --> 00:19:21.995 position:50% align:center
