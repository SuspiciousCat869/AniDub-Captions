[MINERVA]
Diet Member Bult!

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.375 position:50% align:center
[MARY BULT] Lady Minerva.
What can I do for you?

00:00:42.459 --> 00:00:45.295 position:50% align:center
[MINERVA] We must put an end
to the project immediately!

00:00:45.378 --> 00:00:47.088 position:50% align:center
Please counsel
his majesty as such.

00:00:47.172 --> 00:00:49.841 position:50% align:center
Should anything fall into
the anti-imperialists' hands,

00:00:49.924 --> 00:00:52.218 position:50% align:center
the results would
be catastrophic!

00:00:52.302 --> 00:00:54.637 position:50% align:center
But His Majesty is
already aware of that.

00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:55.805 position:50% align:center
Is he aware of the urgency--?

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:57.349 position:50% align:center
[MARY BULT]
His Majesty has committed to

00:00:57.432 --> 00:01:00.060 position:50% align:center
pursuing the project,
regardless of the risks.

00:01:00.143 --> 00:01:02.645 position:50% align:center
He is resolute.

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:05.106 position:50% align:center
Still, though.

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.067 position:50% align:center
[MARY BULT] Which is
precisely why I need you,

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.986 position:50% align:center
and others I trust.
It's paramount.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.363 position:50% align:center
My lady.

00:01:11.446 --> 00:01:15.992 position:50% align:center
Remain strong for both me
and his Majesty as well.

00:01:16.076 --> 00:01:18.119 position:50% align:center
But Diet Member Bult.

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:33.301 position:50% align:center
[JADE HEARNEST]
This is unbelievable.

00:01:34.344 --> 00:01:37.180 position:50% align:center
[FRITZ]
To reach a meltdown so easily.

00:01:37.263 --> 00:01:40.558 position:50% align:center
If it's this unstable,
it's of no use to us.

00:01:40.642 --> 00:01:43.353 position:50% align:center
[JADE HEARNEST]
Yes, a flawed replication.

00:01:57.283 --> 00:01:58.868 position:50% align:center
[SCHAAKE]
Uh, Father?

00:02:00.745 --> 00:02:01.955 position:50% align:center
[LOTUS GUTHEIL]
Oh, Schaake.

00:02:02.038 --> 00:02:06.084 position:50% align:center
Where is Mother?
When's she coming back?

00:02:06.167 --> 00:02:08.086 position:50% align:center
[LOTUS GUTHEIL]
Schaake, listen to me.

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:10.672 position:50% align:center
Your mother left
and won't return.

00:02:14.843 --> 00:02:18.805 position:50% align:center
Here. There's this. Her diary.

00:02:18.888 --> 00:02:21.599 position:50% align:center
Maybe it can help us
find out where she went.

00:02:24.185 --> 00:02:26.354 position:50% align:center
There's no point,
it doesn't matter.

00:02:26.438 --> 00:02:27.689 position:50% align:center
But Father!

00:02:27.772 --> 00:02:31.609 position:50% align:center
Shut up! Can't you see I'm busy?
Quit bothering me!

00:02:33.695 --> 00:02:37.615 position:50% align:center
You're always mean. I hate you!

00:04:19.718 --> 00:04:22.429 position:50% align:center
[INNUMAEL] The Gutheil Domain
is as bustling as ever.

00:04:22.512 --> 00:04:24.014 position:50% align:center
I love this place.

00:04:24.097 --> 00:04:25.765 position:50% align:center
Wait, so you've
been here before?

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:27.892 position:50% align:center
I am a delivery driver.

00:04:27.976 --> 00:04:29.894 position:50% align:center
You mean you were.

00:04:29.978 --> 00:04:32.439 position:50% align:center
I mean, it makes perfect sense
that it would be bustling.

00:04:32.522 --> 00:04:36.693 position:50% align:center
It's a summer
retreat. For nobles.

00:04:36.776 --> 00:04:38.153 position:50% align:center
And, lucky for us.

00:04:38.236 --> 00:04:39.904 position:50% align:center
That makes it a convenient
place for criminals to hide.

00:04:39.988 --> 00:04:42.323 position:50% align:center
Ugh, criminals?

00:04:42.407 --> 00:04:44.034 position:50% align:center
[ZOE]
Lady Schaake!

00:04:46.995 --> 00:04:48.246 position:50% align:center
[car honks]

00:04:48.329 --> 00:04:49.748 position:50% align:center
[ZOE]
Lady Schaake!

00:04:49.831 --> 00:04:51.332 position:50% align:center
[YOUNG WOMAN 05A] It's been
ages since we saw you last!

00:04:51.416 --> 00:04:54.419 position:50% align:center
It has been quite a while, Zoe.
I must say, you three look well.

00:04:54.502 --> 00:04:55.420 position:50% align:center
[ZOE]
There's still some time until

00:04:55.503 --> 00:04:57.213 position:50% align:center
your summer break, isn't there?

00:04:57.297 --> 00:04:59.090 position:50% align:center
So, what brings you
back to town early?

00:04:59.174 --> 00:05:01.926 position:50% align:center
[SCHAAKE] Oh, I-- I'm, uh,
I'm here doing some work

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:03.553 position:50% align:center
on a sociology project.

00:05:03.636 --> 00:05:05.680 position:50% align:center
[YOUNG WOMAN 05A] How long are
you planning to be in town?

00:05:05.764 --> 00:05:08.058 position:50% align:center
We'd love to hear all
your recent adventures.

00:05:08.141 --> 00:05:10.143 position:50% align:center
Especially about the capital!

00:05:10.226 --> 00:05:11.936 position:50% align:center
[SCHAAKE]
Of course, I'd love to.

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:15.690 position:50% align:center
Once I finish my business, we
can find a time to get together.

00:05:15.774 --> 00:05:17.817 position:50% align:center
In her real life,
Schaake's a student.

00:05:17.901 --> 00:05:19.319 position:50% align:center
What?

00:05:19.402 --> 00:05:22.447 position:50% align:center
[KLAUS] Truth is, though,
she hardly ever goes to class.

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:23.948 position:50% align:center
You know her full name?

00:05:24.032 --> 00:05:27.035 position:50% align:center
Schaake Grindel Gutheil.

00:05:27.118 --> 00:05:28.620 position:50% align:center
She's the only
daughter of the Duke

00:05:28.703 --> 00:05:30.580 position:50% align:center
who governs the Gutheil Domain.

00:05:30.663 --> 00:05:32.040 position:50% align:center
What?

00:05:32.123 --> 00:05:35.043 position:50% align:center
But then, how is it that
she's a member of Headkeeper?

00:05:35.126 --> 00:05:37.921 position:50% align:center
[KLAUS] We have hundreds of
members across the Empire,

00:05:38.004 --> 00:05:40.173 position:50% align:center
from all different
walks of life.

00:05:40.256 --> 00:05:41.675 position:50% align:center
That includes nobles
who actually care

00:05:41.758 --> 00:05:43.385 position:50% align:center
about the commonfolk,

00:05:43.468 --> 00:05:46.680 position:50% align:center
and nobles who only
cooperate for the money.

00:05:46.763 --> 00:05:48.098 position:50% align:center
It isn't that strange
that we'd get

00:05:48.181 --> 00:05:50.100 position:50% align:center
an eccentric noble daughter.

00:05:50.183 --> 00:05:52.227 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:54.479 position:50% align:center
Anyway, I'll have
my maid send a note over

00:05:54.562 --> 00:05:56.398 position:50% align:center
and we can finalize
our plans, all right?

00:05:56.481 --> 00:05:57.482 position:50% align:center
Farewell for now!

00:05:57.565 --> 00:05:58.274 position:50% align:center
[YOUNG WOMAN 05A]
Farewell for now!

00:05:58.358 --> 00:06:00.110 position:50% align:center
Farewell for now!

00:06:03.571 --> 00:06:04.489 position:50% align:center
One word.

00:06:04.572 --> 00:06:06.616 position:50% align:center
I haven't even said--

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:09.035 position:50% align:center
[SCHAAKE] And you won't,
or I'll shut you up.

00:06:09.119 --> 00:06:12.497 position:50% align:center
No words here! [chuckles]

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:16.543 position:50% align:center
I'm technically enrolled at
a college in the capital. Okay?

00:06:16.626 --> 00:06:18.503 position:50% align:center
[INNUMAEL]
Yeah, I just heard.

00:06:18.586 --> 00:06:21.381 position:50% align:center
I'm not the only one
with another life here!

00:06:21.464 --> 00:06:22.507 position:50% align:center
Is that true?

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:29.389 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Anyway, want
a job? It'll be fun.

00:06:29.472 --> 00:06:32.058 position:50% align:center
Look, I know we're the ones
who dragged you into this,

00:06:32.142 --> 00:06:34.644 position:50% align:center
but you're still a burden
on the people who hide you.

00:06:34.728 --> 00:06:36.521 position:50% align:center
You should go get 'em a gift.

00:06:36.604 --> 00:06:38.523 position:50% align:center
Uh, yeah, okay.

00:06:38.606 --> 00:06:42.235 position:50% align:center
Here's money and instructions
on what to buy. And where.

00:06:42.318 --> 00:06:43.653 position:50% align:center
'Kay.

00:06:43.737 --> 00:06:46.156 position:50% align:center
If you do anything to
piss off the branch chief here,

00:06:46.239 --> 00:06:49.034 position:50% align:center
you might end up in
the river the next day.

00:06:49.117 --> 00:06:50.243 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:06:55.749 --> 00:07:00.462 position:50% align:center
Let's see. This must be it.

00:07:03.506 --> 00:07:05.550 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:07:06.509 --> 00:07:07.552 position:50% align:center
Welcome!

00:07:07.635 --> 00:07:11.348 position:50% align:center
I need a rice wine.
Pure, high grade.

00:07:11.431 --> 00:07:12.974 position:50% align:center
I think it's called
"Swept Troubles"?

00:07:13.058 --> 00:07:14.893 position:50% align:center
[STORE OWNER 05A] Yep, yep.
I've got some, right over--

00:07:14.976 --> 00:07:18.104 position:50% align:center
[JADE HEARNEST] A bottle for me
too, love, if you don't mind.

00:07:18.188 --> 00:07:20.065 position:50% align:center
[STORE OWNER 05A]
Ah, apologies, sir.

00:07:20.148 --> 00:07:23.318 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, I only have
one bottle in stock.

00:07:23.401 --> 00:07:25.987 position:50% align:center
I should be getting a new
shipment in next week, though.

00:07:26.071 --> 00:07:28.239 position:50% align:center
I hate to ask, but would
you mind letting me have it?

00:07:28.323 --> 00:07:30.492 position:50% align:center
Huh? Hold on a second, man!

00:07:30.575 --> 00:07:33.244 position:50% align:center
I got here way before you did!
You can't just show up--

00:07:33.328 --> 00:07:34.412 position:50% align:center
This is odd.

00:07:34.496 --> 00:07:36.081 position:50% align:center
I mean, I thought
you were a monk.

00:07:36.164 --> 00:07:39.459 position:50% align:center
I was under the impression your
kind abstained from alcohol.

00:07:39.542 --> 00:07:41.169 position:50% align:center
Oh, uh, yes, of course we do,

00:07:41.252 --> 00:07:43.046 position:50% align:center
but I'll be in big
trouble if I don't

00:07:43.129 --> 00:07:44.255 position:50% align:center
walk outta here
with this bottle.

00:07:44.339 --> 00:07:47.509 position:50% align:center
Well, then. What d'you
say we flip for it?

00:07:47.592 --> 00:07:49.844 position:50% align:center
Huh? What? Flip for it?

00:07:49.928 --> 00:07:51.638 position:50% align:center
That's right.

00:07:52.597 --> 00:07:54.265 position:50% align:center
[INNUMAEL]
Fine.

Yeah!

00:08:03.692 --> 00:08:05.777 position:50% align:center
Well, I guess it's yours, then.

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:07.612 position:50% align:center
Sorry, sir.

Excuse me.

00:08:17.122 --> 00:08:19.165 position:50% align:center

[STORE OWNER 05A]
Ah, tough luck.

00:08:20.583 --> 00:08:22.919 position:50% align:center
I just sold the last bottle.
Sorry, sonny.

00:08:23.003 --> 00:08:24.379 position:50% align:center
[BOY 05A]
Oh. Well, um, do you know

00:08:24.462 --> 00:08:26.172 position:50% align:center
if it's sold anywhere
else around here?

00:08:26.256 --> 00:08:28.550 position:50% align:center
Hate to tell ya,
but it's a rare brand.

Running an errand?

00:08:35.724 --> 00:08:36.933 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:08:37.017 --> 00:08:39.269 position:50% align:center
They won't accept
any other bottle?

00:08:39.352 --> 00:08:41.104 position:50% align:center
[BOY 05A]
No, has to be that.

00:08:41.187 --> 00:08:44.149 position:50% align:center

Thank you, sir!

00:08:53.533 --> 00:08:54.826 position:50% align:center
That was sweet.

00:08:54.909 --> 00:08:56.911 position:50% align:center
Couldn't let him get beat up.

00:08:56.995 --> 00:09:01.124 position:50% align:center
Guess I should apologize,
since I ended up not keeping it.

00:09:02.542 --> 00:09:04.669 position:50% align:center
You know, love, you're a cutie.

00:09:04.753 --> 00:09:06.796 position:50% align:center
Uh--

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:09.924 position:50% align:center
[JADE HEARNEST]
I have to say, though. Weird.

00:09:10.008 --> 00:09:12.052 position:50% align:center
I feel like I must've
seen you somewhere before.

00:09:12.135 --> 00:09:14.971 position:50% align:center
[INNUMAEL] Dammit! I forgot
about the wanted posters!

No, Father.

so I can't stay long,
I'm afraid.

[LOTUS GUTHEIL]
You're a busy girl.

00:10:02.769 --> 00:10:04.813 position:50% align:center
Not as busy as you.

00:10:06.231 --> 00:10:07.857 position:50% align:center
Any plans?

00:10:07.941 --> 00:10:09.275 position:50% align:center
I'm tired from the trip.

00:10:09.359 --> 00:10:12.195 position:50% align:center
I think I'll rest
in my room awhile.

00:10:12.278 --> 00:10:13.780 position:50% align:center
[LOTUS GUTHEIL]
Understood.

00:10:13.863 --> 00:10:17.450 position:50% align:center
Then I shall see you at
dinner this evening. Aria.

[ARIA]
Yes, Master.

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:21.204 position:50% align:center
I'll get started
on dinner right away.

00:10:21.287 --> 00:10:24.541 position:50% align:center
My lady, I've run a nice,
hot bath for you.

00:10:24.624 --> 00:10:26.459 position:50% align:center
Would you like
to head there first?

00:10:26.543 --> 00:10:28.586 position:50% align:center
There's something I
need to take care of.

00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:30.463 position:50% align:center
That will have to wait.

00:10:33.925 --> 00:10:36.302 position:50% align:center
That symbol.

00:10:36.386 --> 00:10:38.263 position:50% align:center
I swear.

00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:42.767 position:50% align:center
Ow! That hurt!

00:10:45.437 --> 00:10:48.940 position:50% align:center
Here it is. Mother's old diary!

00:10:53.319 --> 00:10:57.741 position:50% align:center
I knew it. The symbol.

00:10:57.824 --> 00:11:01.202 position:50% align:center
Coincidence? Or something else.

00:11:22.349 --> 00:11:23.308 position:50% align:center
I need to sit down.

Come back empty-handed, huh?

00:11:24.601 --> 00:11:27.270 position:50% align:center
Oh, uh-- They just
happened to be

00:11:27.354 --> 00:11:29.189 position:50% align:center
sold out of what we needed.

00:11:31.816 --> 00:11:33.276 position:50% align:center
Is that right?

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:36.279 position:50% align:center
Well, you'd better pray
the chief is in a good mood.

00:11:36.363 --> 00:11:41.201 position:50% align:center
[INNUMAEL gasps] Oh! Maybe I
could go look somewhere else!

00:11:46.206 --> 00:11:47.957 position:50% align:center
What? It's you?

00:11:48.041 --> 00:11:49.501 position:50% align:center
[JADE HEARNEST]
Name's Jade, love.

You're correct,
I am the branch chief

What's going on?

00:11:56.841 --> 00:11:59.761 position:50% align:center
Ah. Well, you do know
the business I'm in,

00:11:59.844 --> 00:12:02.180 position:50% align:center
don't you, hun? It's simple.

00:12:02.263 --> 00:12:05.100 position:50% align:center
I needed to test you and see
what kind of person you are.

00:12:05.183 --> 00:12:06.976 position:50% align:center
Don't be mad at me.

00:12:07.852 --> 00:12:09.854 position:50% align:center
You guys set me up?

00:12:12.524 --> 00:12:13.441 position:50% align:center
Uh--

00:12:15.402 --> 00:12:17.570 position:50% align:center
You knew, too?

00:12:17.654 --> 00:12:19.447 position:50% align:center
Well, then, Arnolt?

Hm?

Right. Here you go.

00:12:28.623 --> 00:12:30.709 position:50% align:center
Oh, this got you
mixed up with us, right?

00:12:30.792 --> 00:12:34.379 position:50% align:center
Please accept my most
sincere apologies for that.

00:12:34.462 --> 00:12:36.297 position:50% align:center
That must've been inconvenient.

00:12:36.381 --> 00:12:39.676 position:50% align:center
[INNUMAEL]
Thanks. So, what is it, anyway?

00:12:40.635 --> 00:12:42.303 position:50% align:center
You want to know?

00:12:42.387 --> 00:12:44.431 position:50% align:center
Nope. Never mind!

00:12:44.514 --> 00:12:45.557 position:50% align:center
[JADE HEARNEST]
Good answer.

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:47.851 position:50% align:center
Perhaps you're
wiser than you seem.

Why don't we talk
next steps now?

You get a vacation!

Not really. Sorry,
I couldn't resist.

00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:55.608 position:50% align:center
Did something happen?

00:12:55.692 --> 00:12:58.987 position:50% align:center
We have lost all contact
with Elfriede.

00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:00.655 position:50% align:center
I need you lot to go
to the capital and...

00:13:00.739 --> 00:13:02.365 position:50% align:center
Who's Elfriede?

00:13:02.449 --> 00:13:05.076 position:50% align:center
One of ours who was gathering
intel in the capital.

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:06.703 position:50% align:center
[JADE HEARNEST]
No, and three members from

also gone silent.

00:13:08.788 --> 00:13:09.998 position:50% align:center

00:13:10.081 --> 00:13:11.708 position:50% align:center

something of a shift lately

grown a lot better

at predicting our movements.

00:13:16.338 --> 00:13:18.131 position:50% align:center
Are you saying
there's a traitor?

00:13:18.214 --> 00:13:19.591 position:50% align:center
Probably, yes.

00:13:19.674 --> 00:13:22.093 position:50% align:center
In her last report,
Elfriede said she found intel

00:13:22.177 --> 00:13:24.846 position:50% align:center
about luminosis
at a certain location.

00:13:24.929 --> 00:13:26.890 position:50% align:center
Then radio silence.

00:13:26.973 --> 00:13:28.475 position:50% align:center
Luminosis?

00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:31.978 position:50% align:center
[JADE HEARNEST]
Uh-- Yes.

00:13:32.062 --> 00:13:35.315 position:50% align:center
It seems she said something
about an antagonist drug.

00:13:35.398 --> 00:13:37.108 position:50% align:center
I thought there were none.

00:13:37.192 --> 00:13:38.777 position:50% align:center
There are drugs for luminosis?

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:43.531 position:50% align:center
Uh, it's unsubstantiated intel,
so I really can't say.

00:13:43.615 --> 00:13:45.617 position:50% align:center
[BENJAMIN]
And you want us to find her?

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:47.369 position:50% align:center
What about the capital branch?

Don't worry.

00:15:19.169 --> 00:15:21.504 position:50% align:center

That really isn't necessary--

00:15:23.631 --> 00:15:25.633 position:50% align:center

[LOTUS GUTHEIL]
Mm. It's about Schaake.

00:15:39.022 --> 00:15:40.106 position:50% align:center
Right.

[ARIA]
Why are you stopping her?

00:15:56.247 --> 00:15:57.791 position:50% align:center
Why start now?

00:15:57.874 --> 00:16:00.460 position:50% align:center
[LOTUS GUTHEIL] The army has
begun a new operation.

all of Headkeeper at once
and bring them in.

00:16:04.756 --> 00:16:05.799 position:50% align:center
I cannot simply sit back

00:16:05.882 --> 00:16:07.967 position:50% align:center
and allow my daughter
to be caught.

00:16:08.051 --> 00:16:09.969 position:50% align:center
I understand your logic,
but why wouldn't you

00:16:10.053 --> 00:16:12.222 position:50% align:center
just tell the young
mistress the truth?

00:16:12.305 --> 00:16:15.141 position:50% align:center
[chuckles] What would I
even say to her?

00:16:15.225 --> 00:16:17.852 position:50% align:center
That I've known all along about
her work with Headkeeper,

00:16:17.936 --> 00:16:20.772 position:50% align:center
then hand over classified
military intelligence?

00:16:20.855 --> 00:16:22.857 position:50% align:center
Please, don't make me laugh.

00:16:22.941 --> 00:16:24.526 position:50% align:center
This operation's
only been made known

00:16:24.609 --> 00:16:27.112 position:50% align:center

00:16:27.195 --> 00:16:28.780 position:50% align:center

Okay, Klaus.

A favor? 'Kay, what is it?

I need you to
gather some intel.

Find out what Elfriede
learned about luminosis

But why send me?

00:18:08.254 --> 00:18:10.048 position:50% align:center
Look, to Arnolt and the others,

00:18:10.131 --> 00:18:13.760 position:50% align:center
the rescue is more important
than the intel about luminosis.

00:18:15.178 --> 00:18:17.681 position:50% align:center
You're an outsider,
so it has to be you.

Ugh, I dunno, I'm more
involved with Headkeeper

00:18:20.975 --> 00:18:22.727 position:50% align:center
than I ever wanted to be--

00:18:34.406 --> 00:18:35.448 position:50% align:center
Hey, listen.

00:18:35.532 --> 00:18:37.033 position:50% align:center
Uh, yes?

00:18:37.117 --> 00:18:40.495 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO] If you ever need help
with anything, tell me, okay?

00:18:40.578 --> 00:18:43.289 position:50% align:center
I'll try and do whatever I can.

00:18:43.373 --> 00:18:45.583 position:50% align:center
I really appreciate that.

00:18:45.667 --> 00:18:47.711 position:50% align:center
[HELMAN]
Excellent work, Leo.

00:18:47.794 --> 00:18:49.546 position:50% align:center
Right! Thank you, sir.

00:18:49.629 --> 00:18:51.464 position:50% align:center
I brought Sissel Grauer,
like you asked.

00:18:51.548 --> 00:18:54.175 position:50% align:center
Yes. I will take over from here.

00:18:54.259 --> 00:18:56.469 position:50% align:center
You're dismissed now, soldier.

00:18:56.553 --> 00:18:58.513 position:50% align:center
If it's possible,
would it be all right

00:18:58.596 --> 00:19:00.849 position:50% align:center
if I were present
for the interrogation?

00:19:00.932 --> 00:19:03.101 position:50% align:center
I think I can handle it myself.

00:19:03.184 --> 00:19:05.061 position:50% align:center
Return to your post, please.

00:19:06.021 --> 00:19:07.272 position:50% align:center
[HELMAN]
Leo?

00:19:07.355 --> 00:19:10.108 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir! My apologies.

00:19:16.156 --> 00:19:17.782 position:50% align:center
[CONRAD]
Ha! Yes! I win!

00:19:17.866 --> 00:19:19.534 position:50% align:center
Seriously?

00:19:19.617 --> 00:19:21.911 position:50% align:center
Thanks, suckers.

00:19:21.995 --> 00:19:24.039 position:50% align:center
[SQUAD MEMBER 01A]
What's that guy's problem?

00:19:27.334 --> 00:19:29.586 position:50% align:center
[CONRAD]
Hey, buddy, why the long face?

00:19:29.669 --> 00:19:31.755 position:50% align:center
Are you feeling down about
the Zaitz thing again?

00:19:31.838 --> 00:19:34.632 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO] Uh, no.
Not that. It's about Sissel.

00:19:34.716 --> 00:19:37.594 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah? I see how it is.

00:19:37.677 --> 00:19:38.720 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO]
What?

00:19:38.803 --> 00:19:39.804 position:50% align:center
[CONRAD] Lemme give you
a word of advice

00:19:39.888 --> 00:19:41.222 position:50% align:center
on the ways of love.

00:19:41.306 --> 00:19:43.767 position:50% align:center
First off, you can't be
a greedy dog, okay?

00:19:43.850 --> 00:19:45.268 position:50% align:center
Buying her dinner's
no guarantee--

00:19:45.352 --> 00:19:47.395 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO] No, that's not
what I'm talking about at all!

00:19:47.479 --> 00:19:49.898 position:50% align:center
Fine, kid, spill your guts.

00:19:49.981 --> 00:19:53.443 position:50% align:center
It's, um-- I'm more concerned
about the commander.

00:19:53.526 --> 00:19:54.694 position:50% align:center
[CONRAD]
Huh?

00:19:54.778 --> 00:19:55.987 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO] I worry that
he'll be too rough when

00:19:56.071 --> 00:20:00.116 position:50% align:center
he interrogates her.
What do you think?

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:04.162 position:50% align:center
Uh... Well, she hasn't
done anything illegal,

00:20:04.245 --> 00:20:06.247 position:50% align:center
so she shouldn't
be in any danger.

00:20:06.331 --> 00:20:08.667 position:50% align:center
I really want to believe you.

00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:10.085 position:50% align:center
[SQUAD MEMBER 05A]
Hold on, man.

00:20:10.168 --> 00:20:12.045 position:50% align:center
Are you talking about
the girl you guys brought in?

00:20:12.128 --> 00:20:14.381 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO]
Uh, yeah?

00:20:14.464 --> 00:20:15.590 position:50% align:center
I hate to tell you this,

00:20:15.674 --> 00:20:18.468 position:50% align:center
but she was just arrested
and hauled away.

00:20:18.551 --> 00:20:20.387 position:50% align:center
Pardon me, sir! That girl--!

00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:22.931 position:50% align:center
Oh, Leo. What on earth
are you so worked up about--?

00:20:23.014 --> 00:20:26.101 position:50% align:center
What reason could you have
for arresting Sissel Grauer?

00:20:28.144 --> 00:20:29.729 position:50% align:center
Care for some coffee?

00:20:29.813 --> 00:20:31.356 position:50% align:center
No, thank you.

00:20:31.439 --> 00:20:33.608 position:50% align:center
It isn't the standard
military issue crap.

00:20:33.692 --> 00:20:35.777 position:50% align:center
Don't worry. Look.
I get the good stuff,

00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:38.488 position:50% align:center
straight from the workers
unloading it at the harbor.

00:20:38.571 --> 00:20:39.989 position:50% align:center
Why, sir?

00:20:43.368 --> 00:20:47.664 position:50% align:center
[sighs] Sadly, Innumael is
the only member of Headkeeper

00:20:47.747 --> 00:20:50.917 position:50% align:center
for whom we've got a positive
identification at the moment.

00:20:51.001 --> 00:20:54.170 position:50% align:center
If we release his sister
after having her arrested,

00:20:54.254 --> 00:20:55.422 position:50% align:center
for better or worse,

00:20:55.505 --> 00:20:57.298 position:50% align:center
his comrades are sure
to come looking for her.

00:20:57.382 --> 00:20:58.717 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO]
But, sir, that's not--

00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:00.635 position:50% align:center
[HELMAN] And would you
accept responsibility

00:21:00.719 --> 00:21:03.388 position:50% align:center
for what might happen
if they did?

00:21:03.471 --> 00:21:04.973 position:50% align:center
And also--

00:21:12.605 --> 00:21:14.899 position:50% align:center
No, that's all I have to say.

00:21:14.983 --> 00:21:17.027 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir.

00:21:21.114 --> 00:21:22.907 position:50% align:center
Please forgive me.

00:21:22.991 --> 00:21:27.370 position:50% align:center
I never dreamed this
would happen. Sorry.

00:21:27.454 --> 00:21:30.040 position:50% align:center
[SISSEL GRAUER]
Don't hang your head like that.

00:21:30.123 --> 00:21:32.709 position:50% align:center
You have nothing
to apologize for.

00:21:32.792 --> 00:21:35.128 position:50% align:center
Really. I'm okay.

00:21:36.338 --> 00:21:39.507 position:50% align:center
Kind of weird, huh? [giggles]

00:21:39.591 --> 00:21:42.427 position:50% align:center
Leo? May I ask something of you?

00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:45.805 position:50% align:center
Oh-- Yes. What can I do?

00:21:45.889 --> 00:21:48.016 position:50% align:center
If you see my brother...

00:21:50.268 --> 00:21:53.897 position:50% align:center
I understand. I swear
to give it to him.

00:21:57.150 --> 00:21:59.652 position:50% align:center
[ARNOLT] Okay. Contact us
if something happens.

00:21:59.736 --> 00:22:00.612 position:50% align:center
[JADE HEARNEST]
Sure.

00:22:00.695 --> 00:22:02.405 position:50% align:center
[INNUMAEL]
Wait! Wait!

00:22:06.534 --> 00:22:08.203 position:50% align:center
I wanna go, too.

00:22:08.286 --> 00:22:09.329 position:50% align:center
How come?

00:22:09.412 --> 00:22:10.872 position:50% align:center
I don't know.

00:22:10.955 --> 00:22:12.415 position:50% align:center
I got dragged into all this,

00:22:12.499 --> 00:22:15.043 position:50% align:center
but now I'm invested and kinda
want to find out the truth?

00:22:15.126 --> 00:22:16.753 position:50% align:center
[INNUMAEL chuckles]

00:22:16.836 --> 00:22:19.673 position:50% align:center
No way. You're an outsider.
I'm sorry, but we can't let--

00:22:19.756 --> 00:22:21.174 position:50% align:center
[INNUMAEL]
I drive for a living, you know!

00:22:21.257 --> 00:22:22.342 position:50% align:center
I know, but--

00:22:22.425 --> 00:22:24.344 position:50% align:center
If you involve yourself
any further, love,

00:22:24.427 --> 00:22:27.931 position:50% align:center
then you can't claim coercion.
You'll be a full-fledged member.

00:22:28.014 --> 00:22:32.394 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I understand
how it works, but--

00:22:34.229 --> 00:22:35.939 position:50% align:center
[ARNOLT sighs]

00:22:38.108 --> 00:22:39.901 position:50% align:center
Well, we need the help, I guess.

00:22:39.984 --> 00:22:41.027 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:22:41.111 --> 00:22:43.154 position:50% align:center
[ARNOLT]
Someone's gotta drive the truck.

00:22:43.238 --> 00:22:44.906 position:50% align:center
[INNUMAEL]
I'll be your driver!
