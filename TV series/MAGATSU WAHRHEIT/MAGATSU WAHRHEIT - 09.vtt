00:02:06.167 --> 00:02:08.628 position:50% align:center
Private Leocadio,
sir, reporting.

00:02:08.712 --> 00:02:12.340 position:50% align:center
Right. Starting today,
you will be under my command.

00:02:12.424 --> 00:02:13.925 position:50% align:center
Any questions?

00:02:15.468 --> 00:02:18.096 position:50% align:center
Well, yes.
The Headkeeper roundup.

00:02:18.179 --> 00:02:19.889 position:50% align:center
You participated
in that operation

00:02:19.973 --> 00:02:21.975 position:50% align:center
the other day, correct?

00:02:22.058 --> 00:02:23.518 position:50% align:center
[GEURETH]
What about it?

00:02:23.601 --> 00:02:25.603 position:50% align:center
I heard an interesting rumor.

00:02:25.687 --> 00:02:28.606 position:50% align:center
Someone said the operation
was planned by the Diet.

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.525 position:50% align:center
Is that true, sir?

00:02:30.608 --> 00:02:33.153 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't know. Why do you ask?

00:02:33.236 --> 00:02:37.282 position:50% align:center
Oh, um, no reason, just curious.

00:02:44.873 --> 00:02:48.918 position:50% align:center
It's your husband.
Commander Helman.

00:02:49.002 --> 00:02:53.423 position:50% align:center
I regret to inform you
he's passed, Lady Adelina.

00:02:53.506 --> 00:02:58.094 position:50% align:center
He's dead, then?
It can't be. It--

00:03:01.264 --> 00:03:04.517 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO]
And I'm the one who killed him.

00:03:04.601 --> 00:03:07.437 position:50% align:center
I know it wasn't
wrong of me to do it.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.856 position:50% align:center
I know that it was right.

00:03:12.692 --> 00:03:16.529 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO] But regardless,
it saddens me all the same.

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:27.707 position:50% align:center
[IRMA] Hey, good job in there.
It's complicated, isn't it?

00:03:27.791 --> 00:03:29.250 position:50% align:center
Not really.

00:03:36.841 --> 00:03:39.594 position:50% align:center
Why are you following me around?

00:03:39.678 --> 00:03:42.305 position:50% align:center
I was roped into
assisting you people,

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:44.432 position:50% align:center
but it's not like I joined
Headkeeper or something.

00:03:44.516 --> 00:03:45.850 position:50% align:center
You and I aren't friends.

00:03:45.934 --> 00:03:48.812 position:50% align:center
Oh, come on, don't be
such a wet blanket all the time.

00:03:48.895 --> 00:03:52.232 position:50% align:center
No harm in bein'
friendly to a nice lady.

00:03:52.315 --> 00:03:53.608 position:50% align:center
Um, how old are you?

00:03:53.692 --> 00:03:56.569 position:50% align:center
One never asks a lady's age.

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.739 position:50% align:center
Well, your mental age seems low.

00:04:05.662 --> 00:04:08.081 position:50% align:center
[IRMA]
Hey, you two! We just got back.

00:04:08.164 --> 00:04:11.751 position:50% align:center
Hey! Nice work! How'd it go?

00:04:13.712 --> 00:04:16.589 position:50% align:center
[CONRAD sighs] Don't be
so down in the dumps, man.

00:04:16.673 --> 00:04:17.674 position:50% align:center
It's all right.

00:04:17.757 --> 00:04:19.759 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO]
Just let me be, okay?

00:04:19.843 --> 00:04:22.095 position:50% align:center
For real. He was
gonna kill Sissel!

00:04:22.178 --> 00:04:23.513 position:50% align:center
You had no choice!

00:04:23.596 --> 00:04:25.015 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry.

00:04:25.098 --> 00:04:26.474 position:50% align:center
Don't be.

00:04:26.558 --> 00:04:28.977 position:50% align:center
[CONRAD] Anyway, what do
you plan to do next, Leo?

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:30.353 position:50% align:center
You gonna track down
the person selling

00:04:30.437 --> 00:04:33.398 position:50% align:center
the military's seized weapons
on the black market?

00:04:33.481 --> 00:04:36.026 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO] Actually,
I think I have an idea.

00:04:36.109 --> 00:04:37.652 position:50% align:center
For real? Spill it!

00:04:37.736 --> 00:04:39.946 position:50% align:center
You remember that guy
we met, Faust?

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:41.823 position:50% align:center
We were on patrol.
He wears glasses.

00:04:41.906 --> 00:04:43.033 position:50% align:center
He's kind of strange?

00:04:43.116 --> 00:04:47.537 position:50% align:center
Uh... Yeah, now I do.
He was odd.

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.080 position:50% align:center
[CONRAD gasps]

00:04:49.164 --> 00:04:52.417 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO] Exactly. I think you
see where I'm going with this.

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.045 position:50% align:center
He said he was
researching luminosis.

00:04:55.128 --> 00:04:57.422 position:50% align:center
There might just be
some connection.

00:04:57.505 --> 00:04:59.049 position:50% align:center
Interesting.

00:04:59.132 --> 00:05:02.844 position:50% align:center
Even in the capital, only a few
organizations develop drugs.

00:05:02.927 --> 00:05:05.055 position:50% align:center
Factor in luminosis, and--

00:05:05.138 --> 00:05:06.848 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO]
Right. That's precisely why

00:05:06.931 --> 00:05:07.849 position:50% align:center
I'm going to speak with him.

00:05:07.932 --> 00:05:09.642 position:50% align:center
Be careful.

00:05:09.726 --> 00:05:11.853 position:50% align:center
If word gets out that
you're poking around--

00:05:11.936 --> 00:05:13.104 position:50% align:center
Understood.

00:05:13.188 --> 00:05:14.272 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah.

00:05:14.356 --> 00:05:17.192 position:50% align:center
Also, uh, he and I
need to talk privately.

00:05:17.275 --> 00:05:19.152 position:50% align:center
Could we have
the room for a bit?

00:05:19.235 --> 00:05:21.863 position:50% align:center
[IRMA]
Gotcha. Let's go, Sissy.

00:05:21.946 --> 00:05:23.823 position:50% align:center
Oh, of course.

00:05:28.953 --> 00:05:29.913 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:05:29.996 --> 00:05:31.331 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO]
What is it?

00:05:32.582 --> 00:05:35.377 position:50% align:center
[CONRAD]
It's bad.

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:36.878 position:50% align:center
How bad?

00:05:38.505 --> 00:05:41.174 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Is that?

00:05:41.257 --> 00:05:44.511 position:50% align:center
Luminosis. I was there too long.

00:05:44.594 --> 00:05:46.388 position:50% align:center
So, then--

00:05:46.471 --> 00:05:51.226 position:50% align:center
Yeah. That Innumael guy.
He's probably in the same boat.

00:05:52.852 --> 00:05:54.562 position:50% align:center
So, can't drag our feet,

00:05:54.646 --> 00:05:58.358 position:50% align:center
or he and I might both
end up dead. [chuckles]

00:05:58.441 --> 00:06:00.360 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO]
That's not funny, Conrad.

00:06:10.662 --> 00:06:12.789 position:50% align:center
You doing a little
cleaning, or what, Faust?

00:06:12.872 --> 00:06:15.834 position:50% align:center
Oh, hello, Leo. I'm moving.

00:06:15.917 --> 00:06:16.793 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO]
Where to?

00:06:16.876 --> 00:06:19.462 position:50% align:center
[FAUST]
Well, the new capital.

00:06:19.546 --> 00:06:22.882 position:50% align:center
And it doesn't seem like you've
come to help me move, so--?

00:06:22.966 --> 00:06:25.927 position:50% align:center
No, I didn't. Sorry.

00:06:26.011 --> 00:06:28.221 position:50% align:center
[FAUST]
Then, what does bring you here?

00:06:28.304 --> 00:06:30.974 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO]
I'm not sure where to begin.

00:06:31.057 --> 00:06:34.185 position:50% align:center
You see, I've been
learning about luminosis.

00:06:34.269 --> 00:06:35.270 position:50% align:center
[FAUST]
Luminosis?

00:06:35.353 --> 00:06:36.813 position:50% align:center
That's right.

00:06:36.896 --> 00:06:40.275 position:50% align:center
May I ask when exactly they
started researching luminosis?

00:06:40.358 --> 00:06:42.861 position:50% align:center
And why do you want to
know that, exactly?

00:06:42.944 --> 00:06:46.406 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO] Well, for an
internal investigation.

00:06:54.998 --> 00:06:56.624 position:50% align:center
All right then.

00:06:56.708 --> 00:06:59.753 position:50% align:center
I don't know when they started.

00:06:59.836 --> 00:07:02.922 position:50% align:center
I joined my current
organization a year ago,

00:07:03.006 --> 00:07:05.675 position:50% align:center
and I'm told the research
began long before that.

00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:08.970 position:50% align:center
Has anything weird
happened there lately?

00:07:12.057 --> 00:07:13.975 position:50% align:center
What are you asking me?

00:07:16.353 --> 00:07:19.272 position:50% align:center
[FAUST sighs] There have been
some major developments

00:07:19.356 --> 00:07:20.774 position:50% align:center
in the past few months.

00:07:20.857 --> 00:07:22.692 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO gasps]
Like what?

00:07:22.776 --> 00:07:26.071 position:50% align:center
Well, originally the
company was pretty small,

00:07:26.154 --> 00:07:28.406 position:50% align:center
and only took drug
manufacturing jobs,

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:31.493 position:50% align:center
but six months ago,
they got public funding.

00:07:31.576 --> 00:07:32.827 position:50% align:center
[IRMA]
Public funding?

00:07:32.911 --> 00:07:35.622 position:50% align:center
Yes, and I was glad at first.

00:07:35.705 --> 00:07:37.207 position:50% align:center
I thought the country'd
gotten serious about

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:39.918 position:50% align:center
the increase in luminosis cases.

00:07:40.001 --> 00:07:43.505 position:50% align:center
But then they churned out
a huge volume of luminosis data.

00:07:43.588 --> 00:07:45.048 position:50% align:center
Though, to this day,
I still don't know

00:07:45.131 --> 00:07:47.133 position:50% align:center
where any of it could
have come from.

00:07:47.217 --> 00:07:48.218 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO]
Wait, what do you mean?

00:07:48.301 --> 00:07:50.595 position:50% align:center
Luminosis is incurable.

00:07:50.679 --> 00:07:54.099 position:50% align:center
No life-extending treatments
or drugs to halt its progress.

00:07:54.182 --> 00:07:56.851 position:50% align:center
As such, those afflicted
with it don't go to hospitals,

00:07:56.935 --> 00:07:59.562 position:50% align:center
which leaves few
specimens for research.

00:07:59.646 --> 00:08:01.356 position:50% align:center
So, I wonder, where on earth

00:08:01.439 --> 00:08:03.983 position:50% align:center
could they have
gotten all that data?

00:08:04.984 --> 00:08:07.445 position:50% align:center
All of the recent increases

00:08:07.529 --> 00:08:12.075 position:50% align:center
in Coldfire and
monster activity,

00:08:12.158 --> 00:08:17.455 position:50% align:center
the new capital,
and human experiments,

00:08:17.539 --> 00:08:20.125 position:50% align:center
the Awakened and luminosis.

00:08:20.208 --> 00:08:22.877 position:50% align:center
All of these things
are connected.

00:08:24.045 --> 00:08:25.255 position:50% align:center
[FAUST]
But, thanks to all that,

00:08:25.338 --> 00:08:27.716 position:50% align:center
there was a huge
surge in progress.

00:08:27.799 --> 00:08:29.718 position:50% align:center
It's at the
clinical trial stage,

00:08:29.801 --> 00:08:32.053 position:50% align:center
and while there are
still some side effects,

00:08:32.137 --> 00:08:35.098 position:50% align:center
a successful antagonist
drug has been developed.

00:08:35.181 --> 00:08:39.102 position:50% align:center
So, that means Inumaru's
theory was right after all.

00:08:39.185 --> 00:08:40.729 position:50% align:center
Do you have any
additional details

00:08:40.812 --> 00:08:43.523 position:50% align:center
about the public funds
you mentioned?

00:08:43.606 --> 00:08:45.108 position:50% align:center
[FAUST]
Outside my interest.

00:08:45.191 --> 00:08:46.609 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:08:49.446 --> 00:08:52.699 position:50% align:center
[FAUST] When the funds were
received, they made changes,

00:08:52.782 --> 00:08:55.493 position:50% align:center
like suddenly hiring
a new CEO, or so I was told.

00:08:55.577 --> 00:08:57.954 position:50% align:center
But who? A nobleman?

00:08:58.038 --> 00:09:00.373 position:50% align:center
Or, wait, a Diet member?

00:09:00.457 --> 00:09:01.583 position:50% align:center
I don't know.

00:09:01.666 --> 00:09:04.002 position:50% align:center
Though I think his name
may have been Radboud,

00:09:04.085 --> 00:09:06.171 position:50% align:center
but I'm not quite sure.

00:09:06.254 --> 00:09:08.048 position:50% align:center
Radboud, huh?

00:09:08.131 --> 00:09:10.050 position:50% align:center
--[FAUST] Leocadio.
--Huh?

00:09:10.133 --> 00:09:11.343 position:50% align:center
I doubt you're trying to steal

00:09:11.426 --> 00:09:14.554 position:50% align:center
the results of the
luminosis research.

00:09:14.637 --> 00:09:16.639 position:50% align:center
So, what is your goal?

00:09:16.723 --> 00:09:19.059 position:50% align:center
Why would you want
to know any of this?

00:09:19.142 --> 00:09:22.479 position:50% align:center
Uh, well I-- It's for--

00:09:22.562 --> 00:09:23.980 position:50% align:center
Look, I'm just doing my job--

00:09:24.064 --> 00:09:25.565 position:50% align:center
[FAUST]
Don't lie to me.

00:09:25.648 --> 00:09:26.816 position:50% align:center
We need to talk.

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:28.485 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO]
What is it?

00:09:28.568 --> 00:09:30.195 position:50% align:center
[IRMA]
Let's ask him to work with us.

00:09:30.278 --> 00:09:31.613 position:50% align:center
Tell him everything.

00:09:31.696 --> 00:09:33.740 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO]
What? Are you serious?

00:09:33.823 --> 00:09:36.451 position:50% align:center
Asking him to help would mean
making him complicit in a crime!

00:09:36.534 --> 00:09:40.413 position:50% align:center
No, that's not--!
Well, it's not exactly untrue.

00:09:40.497 --> 00:09:43.249 position:50% align:center
Whether the Diet's doing this,
or an unknown organization,

00:09:43.333 --> 00:09:44.709 position:50% align:center
at some point we're gonna need

00:09:44.793 --> 00:09:46.586 position:50% align:center
outside help from
somebody, you know?

00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:49.005 position:50% align:center
I mean it's obvious, Leo!

00:09:49.089 --> 00:09:50.215 position:50% align:center
Don't you think
a friend would be

00:09:50.298 --> 00:09:52.175 position:50% align:center
more trustworthy
than a stranger?

00:09:52.258 --> 00:09:53.093 position:50% align:center
[FAUST]
Depending on the details--

00:09:53.176 --> 00:09:54.469 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:09:54.552 --> 00:09:57.639 position:50% align:center
I might be willing to help you.

00:09:57.722 --> 00:09:58.765 position:50% align:center
Really?

00:09:58.848 --> 00:10:00.058 position:50% align:center
[FAUST]
Yes.

00:10:00.141 --> 00:10:02.435 position:50% align:center
[FAUST chuckles]

00:10:02.519 --> 00:10:03.645 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO]
Uh, Faust?

00:10:03.728 --> 00:10:07.273 position:50% align:center
It all makes sense.
Human experiments.

00:10:07.357 --> 00:10:08.525 position:50% align:center
Well, then, no wonder they were

00:10:08.608 --> 00:10:11.027 position:50% align:center
able to collect
so much specimen data.

00:10:11.111 --> 00:10:13.238 position:50% align:center
Hey, this guy seems
a little off.

00:10:13.321 --> 00:10:15.198 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO]
I don't actually know him well.

00:10:15.281 --> 00:10:17.826 position:50% align:center
He's more of an acquaintance.

00:10:17.909 --> 00:10:20.328 position:50% align:center
[FAUST]
I'm in. I'll work with you guys.

00:10:20.412 --> 00:10:23.039 position:50% align:center
This Radboud guy and
the unknown organization?

00:10:23.123 --> 00:10:25.417 position:50% align:center
Heh. I'll find out
all that I can.

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:28.294 position:50% align:center
We'll surely get to the bottom
of their connection.

00:10:28.378 --> 00:10:30.714 position:50% align:center
We're grateful for your help.

00:10:30.797 --> 00:10:33.508 position:50% align:center
[FAUST] Oh, it's rich.
Just to think that my research

00:10:33.591 --> 00:10:36.803 position:50% align:center
is the fruit of an unhinged,
corrupt organization.

00:10:36.886 --> 00:10:41.099 position:50% align:center
[FAUST chuckles]

00:10:44.269 --> 00:10:47.188 position:50% align:center
Okay. I'd better go meet
back up with the others.

00:10:47.272 --> 00:10:48.440 position:50% align:center
With Headkeeper?

00:10:48.523 --> 00:10:51.693 position:50% align:center
Nice try. No way I'm
taking you to them.

00:10:51.776 --> 00:10:55.572 position:50% align:center
That's fine with me.
I'll head to military HQ.

00:10:55.655 --> 00:10:57.115 position:50% align:center
Somebody over there
has got to know

00:10:57.198 --> 00:10:58.575 position:50% align:center
something about the operation.

00:10:58.658 --> 00:11:00.994 position:50% align:center
Cool. Well, if you
find anything else,

00:11:01.077 --> 00:11:02.871 position:50% align:center
just leave a message with Conny.

00:11:02.954 --> 00:11:03.872 position:50% align:center
Conny?

00:11:03.955 --> 00:11:08.043 position:50% align:center
--See ya!
--Oh, she means Conrad.

00:11:08.126 --> 00:11:11.296 position:50% align:center
Why do I feel like I just
gained another little sister?

00:11:20.513 --> 00:11:22.265 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO]
That's weird.

00:11:23.516 --> 00:11:25.727 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO gasps]

00:11:25.810 --> 00:11:27.187 position:50% align:center
Hey! What is this?

00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:31.399 position:50% align:center
[GEURETH]
Private Leocadio. Oh, how sad.

00:11:31.483 --> 00:11:34.611 position:50% align:center
You're accused of illegally
acquiring classified intel.

00:11:34.694 --> 00:11:35.528 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO]
Excuse me?

00:11:35.612 --> 00:11:36.821 position:50% align:center
Take him away.

00:11:36.905 --> 00:11:40.033 position:50% align:center
Commander, wait!
Tell me what this is all about!

00:11:40.116 --> 00:11:42.786 position:50% align:center
I don't take orders from you.

00:11:42.869 --> 00:11:44.788 position:50% align:center
What is going on here?

00:11:44.871 --> 00:11:45.914 position:50% align:center
[GEURETH]
I said take him away.

00:11:45.997 --> 00:11:50.418 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO]
No! Wait! Hold on!

00:11:50.502 --> 00:11:52.587 position:50% align:center
Don't go! There's
been some mistake!

00:11:52.671 --> 00:11:54.422 position:50% align:center
Please, let me speak
to the commander!

00:11:54.506 --> 00:11:56.508 position:50% align:center
I know I can clear this up!

00:11:58.468 --> 00:12:05.100 position:50% align:center
Why? Dammit! Could it be?

00:12:06.976 --> 00:12:10.897 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO]
Is it because I asked about

00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:13.650 position:50% align:center
the Diet rumor this morning?

00:12:13.733 --> 00:12:18.488 position:50% align:center
Locked up for that?
That's crazy.

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:30.875 position:50% align:center
[yawns] Tired.

00:12:38.008 --> 00:12:39.342 position:50% align:center
[ARNOLT]
Hey.

00:12:41.011 --> 00:12:42.554 position:50% align:center
Are we there?

00:12:46.808 --> 00:12:51.438 position:50% align:center
[ARNOLT] Yeah, look.
That's the new capital, Fiktion.

00:13:00.196 --> 00:13:02.782 position:50% align:center
[INNUMAEL] This place is
still under construction,

00:13:02.866 --> 00:13:05.493 position:50% align:center
but lots of people
seem to live here.

00:13:09.914 --> 00:13:11.124 position:50% align:center
I'll take a copy.

00:13:11.207 --> 00:13:13.126 position:50% align:center
[STAND OWNER 09A]
Come again.

00:13:13.209 --> 00:13:15.795 position:50% align:center
[INNUMAEL] "Mary Bult,
of the House of Peers,

00:13:15.879 --> 00:13:18.757 position:50% align:center
has assumed control of
all the affairs of Fiktion,

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:22.052 position:50% align:center
as a proxy of
His Imperial Majesty.

00:13:22.135 --> 00:13:23.470 position:50% align:center
Along with those duties,

00:13:23.553 --> 00:13:25.555 position:50% align:center
she has also been
appointed a guardian

00:13:25.638 --> 00:13:28.975 position:50% align:center
to His Majesty's son,

00:13:29.059 --> 00:13:32.062 position:50% align:center
Wow. She was always popular.

00:13:32.145 --> 00:13:34.147 position:50% align:center
[SCHAAKE]
Innumael! Let's go!

00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:36.816 position:50% align:center
Uh, coming!

00:13:54.501 --> 00:13:56.336 position:50% align:center

Everybody out!

00:13:57.545 --> 00:13:58.296 position:50% align:center

Out!

00:13:58.380 --> 00:13:59.589 position:50% align:center

Out!

[WORKER 09B]
That's everyone! Ignition!

00:14:16.022 --> 00:14:17.482 position:50% align:center
Bad news, boss!

00:14:17.565 --> 00:14:19.359 position:50% align:center
Some people got trapped
under the rubble!

00:14:19.442 --> 00:14:21.027 position:50% align:center
[OVERSEER 09A sighs]
All uninjured,

00:14:21.111 --> 00:14:23.488 position:50% align:center
start moving the rubble, now!

00:14:25.573 --> 00:14:27.117 position:50% align:center
Pipe down, get to it!

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:29.911 position:50% align:center
I didn't hear anybody
tell you to quit working!

00:14:32.455 --> 00:14:35.959 position:50% align:center
Okay! Everyone drop
your shovels and take five!

00:14:38.962 --> 00:14:40.505 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:14:41.965 --> 00:14:44.342 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO] I need to
get out of here fast.

00:14:44.426 --> 00:14:49.305 position:50% align:center
Maybe I can sneak out at night
and escape through there.

00:14:50.432 --> 00:14:53.476 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO]
No. No good.

00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:56.021 position:50% align:center
I don't know what's
going on in that tunnel.

00:14:59.065 --> 00:15:00.191 position:50% align:center
[DAMIAN]
Hey!

00:15:01.234 --> 00:15:02.569 position:50% align:center
It's you!

00:15:03.486 --> 00:15:07.615 position:50% align:center
[DAMIAN laughs] I guess I made
an impression on you, huh?

00:15:07.699 --> 00:15:11.953 position:50% align:center
I won't lie. It's nice to see
a familiar face in here.

00:15:12.037 --> 00:15:13.580 position:50% align:center
You look well.

00:15:13.663 --> 00:15:15.206 position:50% align:center
But how are you alive?

00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:17.667 position:50% align:center
I'm curious about that, myself.

00:15:17.751 --> 00:15:20.170 position:50% align:center
I still have to take things
fairly easy, though.

00:15:20.253 --> 00:15:21.921 position:50% align:center
Got pretty messed up.

00:15:22.005 --> 00:15:25.175 position:50% align:center
Name's Damian Santos.
Who are you?

00:15:25.925 --> 00:15:27.969 position:50% align:center
My name's Leocadio.

00:15:28.053 --> 00:15:30.680 position:50% align:center
[DAMIAN] Not very friendly,
are ya? That's okay.

00:15:30.764 --> 00:15:32.640 position:50% align:center
Anyway, how'd you
end up in this place?

00:15:32.724 --> 00:15:34.476 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO]
Doesn't really matter, does it.

00:15:34.559 --> 00:15:36.978 position:50% align:center
Come on, I'm curious.
Tell me, man.

00:15:37.062 --> 00:15:38.855 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO] If that's
all you want, buzz off.

00:15:38.938 --> 00:15:40.732 position:50% align:center
I think you'll like
what I have to say,

00:15:40.815 --> 00:15:43.151 position:50% align:center
so you'd better hear me out.

00:15:43.234 --> 00:15:45.153 position:50% align:center
If you wanna get
out of here, that is.

00:15:45.236 --> 00:15:46.321 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:49.491 --> 00:15:52.702 position:50% align:center
That changed
your tune, didn't it?

00:15:52.786 --> 00:15:54.829 position:50% align:center
The way you're looking at
the guards and the exits,

00:15:54.913 --> 00:15:56.873 position:50% align:center
it's obvious what
you're thinking about.

00:15:56.956 --> 00:16:00.168 position:50% align:center
Yeah? So then why haven't
the guards said anything, huh?

00:16:00.251 --> 00:16:02.671 position:50% align:center
[DAMIAN] Because they're
confident about security.

00:16:02.754 --> 00:16:04.005 position:50% align:center
After all, the only way people

00:16:04.089 --> 00:16:05.715 position:50% align:center
can get outta here
is through the front,

00:16:05.799 --> 00:16:07.300 position:50% align:center
at the end of their sentence,

00:16:07.384 --> 00:16:11.012 position:50% align:center
Or, more commonly, through
the morgue, as a corpse.

00:16:11.971 --> 00:16:14.724 position:50% align:center
And you know some other way
out of this place, then?

00:16:14.808 --> 00:16:16.142 position:50% align:center
Is that what you're getting at?

00:16:16.226 --> 00:16:18.895 position:50% align:center
[DAMIAN]
One that requires a partner.

00:16:18.978 --> 00:16:22.107 position:50% align:center
Who, me? Why me, though?

00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:23.316 position:50% align:center
[DAMIAN]
Look around, man.

00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:25.485 position:50% align:center
This is quite a collection
of scoundrels.

00:16:25.568 --> 00:16:29.781 position:50% align:center
It isn't just an issue
of trust. You know?

00:16:29.864 --> 00:16:34.285 position:50% align:center
I won't offer a second time.
And if you really wanna get out,

00:16:34.369 --> 00:16:37.122 position:50% align:center
you could do worse
than to team up with me.

00:16:41.751 --> 00:16:44.295 position:50% align:center
Hell yeah! That's the response
I was hoping for.

00:16:44.379 --> 00:16:45.797 position:50% align:center
[whistle blows]

00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:48.508 position:50% align:center
[OVERSEER 09A] Break's over!
Back to work!

00:16:48.591 --> 00:16:51.636 position:50% align:center
[DAMIAN] Great, so,
how about we continue

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:54.305 position:50% align:center
this conversation
during mealtime?

00:16:58.643 --> 00:17:01.980 position:50% align:center
[OVERSEER 09A]
That's it for today! Line up!

00:17:15.952 --> 00:17:17.078 position:50% align:center
[DAMIAN]
So, first of all,

00:17:17.162 --> 00:17:19.914 position:50% align:center
there are ways to move
around this place.

00:17:21.916 --> 00:17:24.377 position:50% align:center
But getting out is
next to impossible.

00:17:24.461 --> 00:17:25.962 position:50% align:center
They've got us all trapped.

00:17:26.046 --> 00:17:28.173 position:50% align:center
So then what's your
way around that?

00:17:31.051 --> 00:17:34.262 position:50% align:center
Right. In the corridor that's
on the way to the work site,

00:17:34.346 --> 00:17:37.098 position:50% align:center
did you see the section
that's been bricked over?

00:17:37.182 --> 00:17:40.727 position:50% align:center
I don't think-- Oh, yeah!

00:17:40.810 --> 00:17:42.604 position:50% align:center
[DAMIAN] Just on the
other side of that wall,

00:17:42.687 --> 00:17:46.691 position:50% align:center
there's an area the government
has designated off limits.

00:17:46.775 --> 00:17:48.860 position:50% align:center
--There you'll find--
--[LEOCADIO] The subway!

00:17:48.943 --> 00:17:51.905 position:50% align:center
That's right!
You're familiar with it?

00:17:51.988 --> 00:17:53.406 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO]
Somewhat.

00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:55.700 position:50% align:center
[DAMIAN]
Well, that speeds things up.

00:17:55.784 --> 00:17:58.286 position:50% align:center
We'll use the old subway
tunnel network to escape.

00:17:58.370 --> 00:17:59.871 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO]
That's a loose plan.

00:17:59.954 --> 00:18:03.249 position:50% align:center
What are we building down here?
You got any idea?

00:18:03.333 --> 00:18:05.043 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO]
We're building sewer facilities.

00:18:05.126 --> 00:18:07.629 position:50% align:center
Bingo. And that
whole sewer system?

00:18:07.712 --> 00:18:10.465 position:50% align:center
It's connected to the
toilets in our cells.

00:18:10.548 --> 00:18:11.841 position:50% align:center
Dig a hole under
there large enough

00:18:11.925 --> 00:18:13.510 position:50% align:center
for a man to squeeze through,

00:18:13.593 --> 00:18:16.554 position:50% align:center
and that puts you and me
one step closer to freedom.

00:18:16.638 --> 00:18:17.931 position:50% align:center
There's one problem.

00:18:18.014 --> 00:18:21.017 position:50% align:center
You and I aren't cellmates,
so how would that work?

00:18:21.101 --> 00:18:24.813 position:50% align:center
Oh, I'm well aware,
but that will be solved tonight.

00:18:26.439 --> 00:18:28.108 position:50% align:center
[GUARD 09B]
Get in.

00:18:30.443 --> 00:18:33.154 position:50% align:center
[DAMIAN]
Thanks, chief. I mean it.

00:18:34.364 --> 00:18:36.950 position:50% align:center
Huh. Let me know if
you need anything else.

00:18:37.033 --> 00:18:39.285 position:50% align:center
[DAMIAN]
Thank you very much, I will.

00:18:43.289 --> 00:18:45.041 position:50% align:center
[DAMIAN]
What'd I say?

00:18:47.502 --> 00:18:48.628 position:50% align:center
Bribery.

00:18:48.712 --> 00:18:50.714 position:50% align:center
[DAMIAN]
Don't give me that look.

00:18:50.797 --> 00:18:51.840 position:50% align:center
You don't actually think

00:18:51.923 --> 00:18:54.050 position:50% align:center
officials all have
clean hands, do you?

00:18:54.134 --> 00:18:56.011 position:50% align:center
You can't be that naïve.

00:18:56.094 --> 00:18:57.637 position:50% align:center
No, not at all.

00:18:57.721 --> 00:19:00.015 position:50% align:center
Still, whatever the reason,
you're in here, too.

00:19:00.098 --> 00:19:01.683 position:50% align:center
Not much you can say to sway me.

00:19:01.766 --> 00:19:04.644 position:50% align:center
I'm pretty dead set on
carrying this whole thing out.

00:19:04.728 --> 00:19:07.897 position:50% align:center
Okay, then. What do you
want me to do?

00:19:07.981 --> 00:19:11.026 position:50% align:center
[DAMIAN] There's one last thing.
The plan fails without it.

00:19:11.109 --> 00:19:12.986 position:50% align:center
Yeah, and what would that be?

00:19:13.069 --> 00:19:15.238 position:50% align:center
[DAMIAN] The keys for
accessing the work site.

00:19:15.321 --> 00:19:17.657 position:50% align:center
There's no way I can
get 'em all by myself.

00:19:17.741 --> 00:19:20.035 position:50% align:center
Where exactly would I
find those keys?

00:19:22.078 --> 00:19:24.539 position:50% align:center
[DAMIAN]
In the guard tower.

00:19:24.622 --> 00:19:27.334 position:50% align:center
My job will be to keep the
guards around there busy.

00:19:27.417 --> 00:19:29.627 position:50% align:center
While I'm doing that,
you have to find a way

00:19:29.711 --> 00:19:31.963 position:50% align:center
to sneak in and grab the keys.

00:19:40.513 --> 00:19:42.307 position:50% align:center
Now, where are they at?

00:19:44.601 --> 00:19:46.603 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO] Which ones?
Which ones? Which ones?

00:19:46.686 --> 00:19:48.646 position:50% align:center
Jackpot!

00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:50.690 position:50% align:center
[GUARD 09C] Ah! Your daughter
was finally born?

00:19:50.774 --> 00:19:52.067 position:50% align:center
Congratulations!

00:19:52.150 --> 00:19:54.110 position:50% align:center
Thanks. I haven't slept in days.

00:19:54.194 --> 00:19:56.029 position:50% align:center
[GUARD 09C]
How many is that now? Four?

00:19:56.112 --> 00:19:57.989 position:50% align:center
Our third. House is
getting packed.

00:19:58.073 --> 00:19:59.115 position:50% align:center
[GUARD 09C]
That's great!

00:19:59.199 --> 00:20:01.201 position:50% align:center
But isn't that tough
with your salary?

00:20:01.284 --> 00:20:03.703 position:50% align:center
[GUARD 09D] It really is.
I asked about a raise.

00:20:08.375 --> 00:20:10.627 position:50% align:center
Those stingy fat cats--!

00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:12.420 position:50% align:center
Prisoner! What are you
doing in here?

00:20:12.504 --> 00:20:15.590 position:50% align:center
Uh! Nothing! Just--

00:20:17.050 --> 00:20:18.927 position:50% align:center
[GUARD 09B]
Get in there.

00:20:32.774 --> 00:20:36.736 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO]
Dammit! Dammit! Those bastards!

00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:38.738 position:50% align:center
[MINERVA GUTHEIL]
Is someone there?

00:20:38.822 --> 00:20:42.492 position:50% align:center
Did I hear a voice just now?

00:20:42.575 --> 00:20:44.828 position:50% align:center
[MINERVA GUTHEIL] Hello?
Is somebody in there?

00:20:44.911 --> 00:20:48.123 position:50% align:center
Yes! I'm here! Where are you?

00:20:48.206 --> 00:20:51.209 position:50% align:center
[MINERVA GUTHEIL] You can hear
me? Someone's really there?

00:20:52.085 --> 00:20:54.212 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO]
I can! Who are you?

00:20:54.295 --> 00:20:58.174 position:50% align:center
[MINERVA GUTHEIL] Thank
goodness. My name is Minerva.

00:20:58.258 --> 00:21:00.969 position:50% align:center
Minerva Gutheil,
and who might you be?

00:21:06.141 --> 00:21:10.020 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO] Gutheil?
Wait, like the nobles?

00:21:10.103 --> 00:21:11.438 position:50% align:center
[MINERVA GUTHEIL]
Correct.

00:21:11.521 --> 00:21:13.565 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO]
Um, forgive me asking,

00:21:13.648 --> 00:21:16.026 position:50% align:center
but do you have a daughter?

00:21:16.109 --> 00:21:19.612 position:50% align:center
[MINERVA GUTHEIL] What?
Yes. Why? Do you know her?

00:21:19.696 --> 00:21:22.782 position:50% align:center
I think I might.
Would her name be Schaake?

00:21:22.866 --> 00:21:24.451 position:50% align:center
[MINERVA GUTHEIL]
You know Schaake?

00:21:25.326 --> 00:21:27.704 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't exactly
put it that way.

00:21:28.955 --> 00:21:32.625 position:50% align:center
That seems odd. Tell me,
how would you put it, then?

00:21:32.709 --> 00:21:34.961 position:50% align:center
[LEOCADIO]
Uh, well--

00:21:38.089 --> 00:21:39.924 position:50% align:center
[MINERVA GUTHEIL]
You mean, she's part of

00:21:40.008 --> 00:21:41.634 position:50% align:center
that smuggling group.

00:21:41.718 --> 00:21:43.178 position:50% align:center
That's why I need to escape.

00:21:43.261 --> 00:21:48.141 position:50% align:center
I have to meet back up with them
as soon as possible. Dammit!

00:21:50.643 --> 00:21:53.897 position:50% align:center
[MINERVA GUTHEIL] Leocadio,
I have a favor to ask of you.

00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:55.690 position:50% align:center
What kind of favor?

00:21:58.234 --> 00:22:01.029 position:50% align:center
Looks like security's
pretty heavy here.

00:22:01.112 --> 00:22:03.990 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that's because
this is the nobles' district.

00:22:04.074 --> 00:22:06.368 position:50% align:center
Hopefully they don't
give us any trouble.

00:22:09.329 --> 00:22:11.039 position:50% align:center
[GATE GUARD 09A]
Do you have business here?

00:22:11.122 --> 00:22:12.290 position:50% align:center
We do.

00:22:12.374 --> 00:22:14.876 position:50% align:center
You see, we need to meet
with Georg Eszterházy,

00:22:14.959 --> 00:22:16.586 position:50% align:center
the Commander of
the Holy Knights.

00:22:16.670 --> 00:22:18.046 position:50% align:center
Can you help?

00:22:20.590 --> 00:22:22.634 position:50% align:center
[GATE GUARD 09A]
Conrad Wisdom.

00:22:23.635 --> 00:22:25.929 position:50% align:center
Huh. You don't
strike me as a soldier.

00:22:26.012 --> 00:22:27.389 position:50% align:center
[INNUMAEL]
Yeah, I get that a lot.

00:22:27.472 --> 00:22:28.390 position:50% align:center
And who are the rest of--?

00:22:28.473 --> 00:22:29.557 position:50% align:center
[ARNOLT, BENJAMIN]
Retinue, sir!

00:22:29.641 --> 00:22:30.809 position:50% align:center
Ah, yes. Right.

00:22:30.892 --> 00:22:32.060 position:50% align:center
I'll go check with him.

00:22:32.143 --> 00:22:33.144 position:50% align:center
[GATE GUARD 09A]
Okay.

00:22:33.228 --> 00:22:35.230 position:50% align:center
I must confirm
with Lord Georg first.

00:22:35.313 --> 00:22:36.731 position:50% align:center
Wait here, please.

00:22:47.409 --> 00:22:49.953 position:50% align:center
Lord Georg says that he's
never heard of these guys.

00:22:50.036 --> 00:22:52.205 position:50% align:center
Come back with
an appointment, please.

00:22:52.288 --> 00:22:54.624 position:50% align:center
You don't understand, this is
important business! Tell him--

00:22:54.708 --> 00:22:55.542 position:50% align:center
Do as I said!

00:22:55.625 --> 00:22:56.960 position:50% align:center
Can you just check again,

00:22:57.043 --> 00:22:59.295 position:50% align:center
and tell Lord Georg that
Elfriede is the one who sent us?

00:22:59.379 --> 00:23:00.797 position:50% align:center
Please, sir. We really
need to speak with--

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:02.048 position:50% align:center
[GATE GUARD 09A]
No.

00:23:02.132 --> 00:23:04.926 position:50% align:center
Gentlemen. This is an
urgent matter of state.

00:23:05.010 --> 00:23:11.725 position:50% align:center
If things go badly, you two
would be held responsible. 'Kay?

00:23:11.808 --> 00:23:13.685 position:50% align:center
Wait here, please.

00:23:16.062 --> 00:23:17.939 position:50% align:center
You may pass through.

00:23:23.945 --> 00:23:27.490 position:50% align:center
[INNUMAEL chuckles] Thanks,
guys. Good work out here.

00:23:27.574 --> 00:23:29.159 position:50% align:center
Thank you very much.

00:23:37.208 --> 00:23:39.127 position:50% align:center
Greetings, sir.
We're here to see--

00:23:39.210 --> 00:23:43.173 position:50% align:center
I know, Elfriede sent you,
or that's what you claim.

00:23:43.256 --> 00:23:46.384 position:50% align:center
I am sure there's some way
you can prove that to us.

00:23:48.053 --> 00:23:50.972 position:50% align:center
There's this.

00:23:51.056 --> 00:23:53.266 position:50% align:center
[BUTLER 09A]
Thank you. Please wait here.

00:23:57.187 --> 00:23:58.396 position:50% align:center
[INNUMAEL gasps]

00:24:01.691 --> 00:24:03.068 position:50% align:center
[ARNOLT]
Here goes.
