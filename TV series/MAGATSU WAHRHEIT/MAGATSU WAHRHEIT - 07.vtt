Uh... Wait, so that was who we
were supposed to rescue?

00:03:03.058 --> 00:03:04.809 position:50% align:center
That was Elfriede?

00:03:04.893 --> 00:03:08.688 position:50% align:center
[ARNOLT] Yeah. She transformed
right in front of me.

This place,
this "research facility,"

00:03:12.233 --> 00:03:14.486 position:50% align:center
it's far worse than we imagined.

Hey, Innumael, what do you
think about that monster?

00:03:21.826 --> 00:03:25.121 position:50% align:center
I feel like it's similar
to the one we saw

00:03:25.205 --> 00:03:26.831 position:50% align:center
at the ruins in the forest.

00:03:26.915 --> 00:03:30.502 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I'm glad to
know you think so, too.

00:03:30.585 --> 00:03:33.588 position:50% align:center
This lab, the monsters,
and the fact that

00:03:33.672 --> 00:03:36.508 position:50% align:center
the military knew
about our operation.

00:03:36.591 --> 00:03:38.677 position:50% align:center
It all happened
at the same time.

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.762 position:50% align:center
It can't be a coincidence.

00:04:22.137 --> 00:04:23.138 position:50% align:center
Only thing I've heard is that

00:04:23.221 --> 00:04:25.140 position:50% align:center
the situation might be
even more nuts

00:04:25.223 --> 00:04:27.892 position:50% align:center

What is it?

00:04:47.996 --> 00:04:49.497 position:50% align:center
[SUBORDINATE 07A]
I have received a report.

00:04:49.581 --> 00:04:51.791 position:50% align:center
Information about
the Headkeeper roundup.

00:04:51.875 --> 00:04:53.418 position:50% align:center
It seems that
multiple monsters have

00:04:53.501 --> 00:04:56.004 position:50% align:center
appeared within
the operation zones.

00:04:56.087 --> 00:04:58.673 position:50% align:center
The military is wiping them out.

00:04:58.757 --> 00:05:00.383 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately,
there have been dozens

00:05:00.467 --> 00:05:03.261 position:50% align:center
of military and
civilian casualties.

00:05:03.345 --> 00:05:04.679 position:50% align:center
All members of Headkeeper have

00:05:04.763 --> 00:05:07.891 position:50% align:center

with no particulars ascertained.

[SUBORDINATE 07A]
What are your orders?

00:05:11.478 --> 00:05:13.938 position:50% align:center
[MARY BULT] Tell the
Imperial Army to prioritize

00:05:14.022 --> 00:05:18.610 position:50% align:center
eliminating the monsters.
In addition--

00:05:18.693 --> 00:05:20.570 position:50% align:center
Tell Public Relations
that this incident

00:05:20.653 --> 00:05:23.323 position:50% align:center
was an attack by Headkeeper.

00:05:23.406 --> 00:05:25.408 position:50% align:center
Have PR report that they claimed

00:05:25.492 --> 00:05:28.953 position:50% align:center
retaliation against us
via monsters.

00:05:29.037 --> 00:05:30.205 position:50% align:center
[SUBORDINATE 07A]
Very well.

00:05:30.288 --> 00:05:32.916 position:50% align:center
Also, the Cradle should

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:37.212 position:50% align:center

As you wish.

No doubt about that.

00:08:39.602 --> 00:08:41.021 position:50% align:center
[HELMAN] They've chosen
a troublesome place

00:08:41.104 --> 00:08:43.273 position:50% align:center
to hide, haven't they?

00:08:43.356 --> 00:08:44.441 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah?

00:08:44.524 --> 00:08:46.401 position:50% align:center
Don't think I've ever
been here before.

00:08:46.484 --> 00:08:51.364 position:50% align:center
His Majesty, the Emperor,
declared this area off limits.

00:08:51.448 --> 00:08:54.284 position:50% align:center
But people have lived here
until about 20 years ago.

00:08:54.367 --> 00:08:58.663 position:50% align:center
However, some of that
appeared here, you know?

00:08:58.747 --> 00:09:01.291 position:50% align:center
Huh? "Some" what?

00:09:01.374 --> 00:09:03.418 position:50% align:center
Coldfire, what else, gold?

00:09:03.501 --> 00:09:07.797 position:50% align:center
What? They found Coldfire here?
In a place like this?

00:09:07.881 --> 00:09:12.385 position:50% align:center
But this isn't even
five kilometers from downtown!

00:09:12.469 --> 00:09:13.887 position:50% align:center
[HELMAN]
As the population grew,

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:17.557 position:50% align:center
space became scarce
on the surface.

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:20.185 position:50% align:center
So, they created residential
space underground,

00:09:20.268 --> 00:09:22.520 position:50% align:center
and expanded the
transportation network.

00:09:22.604 --> 00:09:25.523 position:50% align:center
The excavation is
what revealed it, actually.

00:09:25.607 --> 00:09:30.195 position:50% align:center
A pool of coldfire, almost
like magma, was unearthed.

00:09:31.613 --> 00:09:32.822 position:50% align:center
[HELMAN]
And that, my dear Conrad,

00:09:32.906 --> 00:09:36.201 position:50% align:center
is precisely why the
area remains off limits.

00:09:37.118 --> 00:09:40.288 position:50% align:center
It's hard to believe
that there's some so close.

00:09:40.372 --> 00:09:43.792 position:50% align:center
But now is not the time
for talk. Right, Morra?

00:09:43.875 --> 00:09:47.295 position:50% align:center
I would like for you take care
of the matter we discussed now.

00:09:47.379 --> 00:09:49.631 position:50% align:center
[MORRA]
Yes, sir. Understood.

00:09:51.633 --> 00:09:54.636 position:50% align:center
Pardon. What matter, sir?

00:10:04.896 --> 00:10:07.273 position:50% align:center
[IRMA] I doubt they'll
follow us this far in.

00:10:08.233 --> 00:10:09.859 position:50% align:center
I'm not so sure.

00:10:09.943 --> 00:10:11.277 position:50% align:center
Huh? What's up?

00:10:11.361 --> 00:10:15.448 position:50% align:center
Well, because, the guy who
jumped on the van before--

00:10:15.532 --> 00:10:17.701 position:50% align:center
I, uh-- Ugh.

00:10:17.784 --> 00:10:19.494 position:50% align:center
I killed one of his comrades.

00:10:19.577 --> 00:10:20.829 position:50% align:center
So, that's why.

00:10:20.912 --> 00:10:24.708 position:50% align:center
What? So, you're
saying we're screwed?

00:10:24.791 --> 00:10:26.334 position:50% align:center
[INNUMAEL]
Yeah.

00:10:34.342 --> 00:10:36.970 position:50% align:center
So, then what do we do?

00:10:37.929 --> 00:10:40.015 position:50% align:center
I mean, even if we could
get in touch with someone,

00:10:40.098 --> 00:10:42.350 position:50% align:center
who knows if anyone
could help us?

00:10:42.434 --> 00:10:44.769 position:50% align:center
Should we leave the capital?

00:10:45.729 --> 00:10:49.733 position:50% align:center
[IRMA] Oh, wait a minute.
Did anyone ever find Elfriede?

00:10:49.816 --> 00:10:52.110 position:50% align:center
Hey! Listen!

00:10:54.195 --> 00:10:59.576 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Arnolt found her and said
she'd turned into a monster.

00:10:59.659 --> 00:11:01.119 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:11:03.288 --> 00:11:05.749 position:50% align:center
Look, I don't really
get it either.

00:11:05.832 --> 00:11:09.336 position:50% align:center
But the mental institution
and paper factory,

00:11:09.419 --> 00:11:12.505 position:50% align:center
they were both
research facilities.

00:11:12.589 --> 00:11:14.924 position:50% align:center
So, what does that mean?

00:11:16.718 --> 00:11:18.511 position:50% align:center
Just forget it.

00:11:18.595 --> 00:11:20.388 position:50% align:center
Supposedly,
this all started with

00:11:20.472 --> 00:11:23.683 position:50% align:center
intel on a treatment
for luminosis.

00:11:23.767 --> 00:11:27.771 position:50% align:center
Does this mean that
intel was totally false?

00:11:27.854 --> 00:11:29.397 position:50% align:center
But wait--

00:11:30.273 --> 00:11:32.650 position:50% align:center
[FAUST] I work in
pharmaceutical development.

00:11:32.734 --> 00:11:34.736 position:50% align:center
Like, drugs? What kind?

00:11:34.819 --> 00:11:37.072 position:50% align:center
[FAUST]
For luminosis, primarily.

00:11:38.156 --> 00:11:41.117 position:50% align:center
[INNUMAEL] Could the treatment
stuff somehow be related?

00:11:41.201 --> 00:11:44.996 position:50% align:center
Arnolt did say that this can't
all just be coincidence.

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:48.958 position:50% align:center
Then, where's the
intel leaking from?

00:11:49.042 --> 00:11:50.335 position:50% align:center
Hey, what's wrong?

00:11:50.418 --> 00:11:52.962 position:50% align:center
Uh, it's nothing.

00:11:53.046 --> 00:11:54.047 position:50% align:center

00:12:00.929 --> 00:12:03.807 position:50% align:center

come after us!

00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:05.600 position:50% align:center

Should we hide and wait?

00:12:05.684 --> 00:12:08.353 position:50% align:center
No. Let's get out of here.

00:12:08.436 --> 00:12:10.980 position:50% align:center
They'll definitely
find us if we don't.

What now, sir?

00:12:28.665 --> 00:12:32.377 position:50% align:center
It would appear that our
