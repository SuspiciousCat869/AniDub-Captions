00:00:13,958 --> 00:00:16,166
[WOMAN 1A] So what's gonna
happen to the boy?

2
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:18,291
[MAN 1A] I guess someone
will have to take him in.

3
00:00:18,375 --> 00:00:19,666
[WOMAN 1B]
Well, there's no way I can.

4
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:21,208
We've already got too many kids.

5
00:00:21,291 --> 00:00:22,458
[MAN 1B]
Same here.

6
00:00:22,541 --> 00:00:23,875
[WOMAN 1A] But someone
has to look after him.

7
00:00:23,958 --> 00:00:24,958
[WOMAN 1B]
Someone...

8
00:00:25,041 --> 00:00:26,750
[MAN 1A]
Someone else.

9
00:00:26,833 --> 00:00:28,000
[TORU]
Listen to yourselves.

10
00:00:28,083 --> 00:00:30,125
Is "someone else"
all you know how to say?

11
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:31,500
[WOMAN 1B]
It's not like you can do it.

12
00:00:31,583 --> 00:00:32,833
That would never work.

13
00:00:32,916 --> 00:00:35,541
[TORU] Yeah, it would.
I'm his uncle, after all.

14
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:38,083
[TORU]
Mahiru.

15
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:42,166
You need for life to be simple.

16
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,791
So from now on,
I'll take care of you.

17
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:24,958
[MAHIRU] I'm Mahiru Shirota,
15 years old.

18
00:02:25,041 --> 00:02:26,666
I like to keep things simple.

19
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,708
And try to keep
life uncomplicated.

20
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:37,000
That's why I picked him up.

21
00:02:37,083 --> 00:02:39,416
I didn't want to just leave
him there and regret it later.

22
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,875
That would be irritating.

23
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:45,541
[MAHIRU]
There you go. Perfect!

24
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:48,291
I'll name you Kuro.

25
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:50,500
[MAHIRU] I had no idea I was
inviting trouble into my home

26
00:02:50,583 --> 00:02:52,250
and putting my life in danger...

27
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:53,583
...until the next day.

28
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:00,250
[GIRL STUDENT 1A]
Um, okay.

29
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:01,416
Then with that settled,

30
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,708
it looks like all
that's left is deciding

31
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:04,666
who's gonna be in
charge of the costumes.

32
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:05,708
[GIRL STUDENT 1B]
Well, don't look at me.

33
00:03:05,791 --> 00:03:07,166
I've never made clothes before.

34
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:08,250
[BOY STUDENT 1A]
Me either.

35
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:09,791
Does anyone here
even know how to sew?

36
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:11,500
Oh, I got it... Mahiru.

37
00:03:11,583 --> 00:03:14,041
No way. He's already in charge
of getting all the food ready.

38
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:16,666
Yeah, but he's a total
master at doing chores and stuff

39
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:17,833
since he lives alone.

40
00:03:17,916 --> 00:03:20,083
You make him sound
like some kinda maid.

41
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:21,416
Are you still not finished?!

42
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,708
How long can it take
to decide who does what?!

43
00:03:23,791 --> 00:03:24,458
[KOYUKI]
Mahiru?

44
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:25,875
What a pain!

45
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:28,625
Oh, and here, I baked a
test batch of cookies to try.

46
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,708
Whoa! Hey! Get in line!

47
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:31,958
There's plenty for everyone!

48
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:33,000
Stop pushing!

49
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:35,083
So good!

50
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:36,333
Dang, Mahiru,

51
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:37,833
this tastes like it was
made by a master chef!

52
00:03:37,916 --> 00:03:39,250
And it's only a butter cookie.

53
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:41,416
I like to keep recipes simple.

54
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,333
[MAHIRU] So costumes
are all that's left, huh?

55
00:03:43,416 --> 00:03:45,791
The person in charge of that
will need to know how to sew.

56
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:47,208
--And have lots of free time.
--[ALL] Mm-hmm.

--The choice is obvious.
--[ALL] Mm-hmm.

58
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,750

--[STUDENTS] Yay!
--[SAKUYA] Mahiru for the win!

[KOYUKI]
Are you sure about this?

61
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:01,625
You've got a lot on your plate
already doing the food prep.

62
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:03,541
You always take on so much.

63
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:04,833
[MAHIRU]
Let me get this straight.

64
00:04:04,916 --> 00:04:05,958
We need someone who's fast,

65
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:08,125
but not in the
track club to run?

66
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:09,375
Then it's gotta be me!

67
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:10,833
--[STUDENTS] Yay!
--[SAKUYA] Thanks, Mahiru!

68
00:04:10,916 --> 00:04:12,416
[MAHIRU]
Taking care of the class rabbit?

69
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,666
I can handle it!

70
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:14,916
--[STUDENTS] Yay!
--[SAKUYA] That's my boi!

71
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,041
It's just easier if I
step up and volunteer.

72
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:18,583
I mean, someone's
gotta do this stuff.

73
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:20,416
But doesn't it kinda suck
since you have to do

74
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,125
everything on your own, Mahiru?

75
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:23,500
As your friend since childhood,

76
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:25,166
I feel like I should
lend a hand.

77
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:27,458
But first you'll have to
teach me how to thread a needle.

78
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:30,416
That would be so much more
trouble than it's worth.

He's got a point, though.

I've always kinda wanted
to ask you something.

81
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,375
Doesn't all that
responsibility get annoying?

82
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:38,791
What do you mean?

83
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:40,125
[RYUSEI] Well, you're always
taking jobs other people

84
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:41,125
don't want.

85
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:42,208
It's gotta get old.

00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:43,625
[MAHIRU]
Nah.

87
00:04:43,708 --> 00:04:45,208
It's a lot simpler than
trying to get out of doing it.

88
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:47,166
Huh? I don't get you.

89
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,583
You're making it easier
for everyone else,

90
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:51,250
but way harder on yourself.

91
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:53,125
Yeah, I guess you
could say that.

92

I look at the situation.

00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:29,708
[MAHIRU]
Kuro?

157
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,666
Hey, what do you
think you're doing?

158
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,125
I'm not supposed to be
in the sunlight,

159
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:37,041
so keep those shut, okay?

160
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:39,250
Wha--? What in
the world are you?

161
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:41,333
[KURO]
Nothing special.

162
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:44,458
I'm just a kind-hearted shut-in.

163
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:47,041
One who happens to be a vampire.

164
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:52,083
[MAHIRU] That's it,
you're going out the window.

165
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:53,625
[KURO]
No! What's wrong with you?

166
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:55,875
I'm a vampire; you can't throw
me out in the sun! I'll die!

167
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:58,583
I mean, okay, technically
I'm immortal, but still.

168
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:01,166
How come you humans
are such mean creatures?

169
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:03,333
[MAHIRU]
Shut up, evil spirit!

170
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:05,416
Wait, a vampire?

171
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,333
Are you that street slasher?

172
00:08:07,416 --> 00:08:09,833
Did you come here to bite me
and drink all my blood?!

173
00:08:09,916 --> 00:08:11,125
Sounds like a lot of work.

174
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:13,208
Why would I bother going
through so much trouble?

175
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:15,708
And what makes you think you're
the kinda person I'd bite?

176
00:08:15,791 --> 00:08:17,208
You think highly of yourself.

177
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:18,875
[MAHIRU] Isn't that just
what vampires do?!

178
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:21,791
Maybe don't jump to conclusions
when you're judging people.

179
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:24,041
Actually, I am getting
pretty thirsty.

180
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:25,458
Could you make me some tea?

181
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:27,375
[MAHIRU] I don't even know
where to begin with you!

182
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:29,583
[KURO] Maybe start
by cooling down a bit.

183
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:31,791
I can get out of your
way once it gets dark.

184
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:33,750
Until then make sure
you don't say my name

185
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:35,250
while I'm in human form.

186
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:36,583
[MAHIRU]
Huh?

187
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:38,750
How would I do that?
I have no idea who you are!

188
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:41,500
I only know what I called
you as a cat. Kuro!

189
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,500
You're so stupid I could die.

190
00:08:57,583 --> 00:08:58,791
What the hell just happened?!

191
00:08:58,875 --> 00:08:59,666
I hate this.

192
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,625
Stop ignoring me, cat! Explain!

193
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,166
Explaining is such a pain.

194
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:06,500
Start talking right now!
I want simple answers!

195
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:09,833
[KURO] You sure are
demanding, aren't you?

196
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:11,250
But okay.

197
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:14,375
I'll begin with something
that's pretty obvious.

198
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:16,541
You and I would die
before ever getting along.

199
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:19,541
Yeah? You know, I was thinking
the exact same thing!

200
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:25,583
Wait, so you're
basically a pet vampire?

201
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:27,500
[KURO]
Ugh. How to explain...?

202
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:30,166
Vampires like me only drink
blood from the master

203
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:31,625
we have a contract with.

204
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:33,583
And we follow
our masters' orders,

205
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:35,083
even if they're bothersome.

206
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:37,625
There's a name
for vampires like me.

207
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:39,333
But there's really
no point in telling you,

208
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:40,875
if I'm being honest.

209
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:43,416
Hey, could you at least try
to not get crumbs everywhere?!

210
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,583
So just now...

211
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:46,083
Please don't tell me
I accidentally made

212
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:47,833
a contract with you.

213
00:09:47,916 --> 00:09:50,916
[KURO] Sort of.
But it was a temporary one.

214
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,791
How long does it last?

215
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:55,208
[KURO] If I don't drink your
blood in the next 24 hours,

216
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:57,000
it'll be
automatically cancelled.

217
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:59,125
So you don't need to worry.

218
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:00,541
[sighs]

219
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:02,541
24 hours, huh?

220
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:04,416
All right.

221
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,458
Then go somewhere else.
See ya never.

222
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:11,958
[MAHIRU gasps]

223
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:15,208
Not as easy as that.

224
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:18,333
Until the contract is cancelled,
we have to stay close together.

225
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:20,375
Those are the rules.

226
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:23,166
I can't believe I have to
stay chained to you all day.

227
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:25,375
[MAHIRU]
Trust me. The feeling is mutual.

228
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:29,458
[MAHIRU] How did you manage
to make such a mess so fast?

229
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:31,083
[KURO]
Ow! Ah!

230
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:33,625
[grunting]

231
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:35,833
Why are you so abusive
towards a cute little pet?

232
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:39,125
What would your parents
say if they saw you now?

233
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:41,500
Uh, where are they, anyway?

234
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:45,125
[MAHIRU]
My mom...

235
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:47,666
[tires screeching]

236
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:50,750
She died in an accident
a long time ago.

237
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:53,291
I was all alone after that.

238
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:56,333
My relatives didn't really
know what to do with me.

239
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:58,916
Fortunately, my uncle
ended up taking me in.

240
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:04,083
If it hadn't been for him,

241
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:06,875
I don't know what would
have happened to me.

242
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:09,041
[KURO]
Oh, I get it.

243
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:11,083
That's why you felt
sorry for a little stray

244
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:12,625
and decided to take me home.

245
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:14,000
What an idiot.

246
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:16,125
Look at what an annoying
mess you've gotten us into.

247
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:18,916
How am I the source
of this problem?!

248
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,041
Oh, I forgot.
I have to run errands.

249
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:23,333
[KURO]
Not possible. Forget about them.

250
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:25,708
You and I still
can't be separated yet.

251
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:27,375
Okay, then you'll
have to come with me.

252
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:28,625
[KURO]
Are you crazy?

253
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:31,000
I can't face the sunlight,
stupid. Remember?

254
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:33,083
[MAHIRU] It's getting dark.
You'll be fine.

255
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:36,708
[glass breaks]

256

[KOYUKI]
Wait. This cat?

257
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,000
It's a vampire?

258
00:11:58,083 --> 00:12:00,291
[MAHIRU] Exactly! Just
like Sakuya said earlier!

259
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:02,125
That rumor about
vampires is true!

260
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:04,208
This thing is
actually super evil!

261
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:06,208
Ugh! Why isn't Sakuya here?

262
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:07,958
He'd be all over this!

263
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:10,083
[KOYUKI]
Um... is this a joke?

264
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:12,000
[RYUSEI]
That's just a cat. For real.

265
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:13,833
[MAHIRU]
No! He can turn into a human!

C'mon, Kuro. Speak!
Show 'em what I'm talking about!

267
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:18,208
Why don't you say something?

[KOYUKI]
Uh... Mahiru...

You're tired, aren't you?

00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:23,458
For sure.
You've overloaded yourself.

[MAHIRU]
That's not it!

Um... Let's see.

How can I prove
I'm telling the truth?

Greetings and salutations!

why not stop a moment and

Huh?

00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,166
Amazing! It's some

That's a good question.

[RYUSEI]
Huh?

because he ignored me?

Two, because he
cut in front of me?

Three, because I'm very hungry?

Or four, um...
because he ignored me?!

The crowds always get
more excited about bloodshed

it's much more rare

to see a vampire on the

00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:57,000
Why would you do
something like this?

313
00:13:57,083 --> 00:13:58,333
Who are you?

314
00:13:59,916 --> 00:14:01,583
Are you a friend of Kuro's?

315
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,166
[BERUKIA make buzzer noise]

316
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,583
No! I hate that
little black cat.

317
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:09,583
Bleh! Bleh! 

318
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:11,166
The absolute worst!

319
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:15,541
That's why I'll skewer you
if you try to protect him.

320
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:17,708
Now, then, let's hear
some applause, yes?

321
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:19,000
Come on out, kitten!

322
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:20,791
Where are you, Sleepy Ash?

323
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:23,166
Make an entrance.
Give us a show!

324
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25,166
Vampires should
show a little bravado!

325
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:26,958
Let's kill all these humans.

326
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:29,666
After all, he wishes
it to be this way--

327
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:34,291
[MAHIRU] Kuro!
What's that guy talking about?

328
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:36,208
More importantly, for now...

329
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:37,250
...let's run!

330
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:39,791
[MAHIRU]
Huh? Hey, wait! Kuro!

331
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:41,250
[MALE 1A]
This looks like a horror movie.

332
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:42,833
There's so much blood!

333
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:44,916
[FEMALE 1A] I can't believe this
happened right in front of us.

334
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,500
[MAHIRU] Why are you
running away, you dumb cat?

335
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:49,333
My friends are back there!

336
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:51,583
There's no way
I can hold my own

337
00:14:51,666 --> 00:14:53,625
against a crazy vampire
like that one.

338
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:54,625
We should go.

339
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:56,000
But you're a
crazy vampire, too!

340
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:57,833
Can't you do something to help?

341
00:14:57,916 --> 00:14:59,500
[KURO]
I don't know who that guy is.

342
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:02,208
I've got nothing
to do with this.

343
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:04,333
No way!
He just attacked my friend!

344
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:07,291
If we leave now, then we
leave everyone in danger.

345
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:09,708
Someone has to stop him!

346
00:15:09,791 --> 00:15:12,000
[KURO]
What a pain.

347
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:13,458
"I can't do anything."

348
00:15:13,541 --> 00:15:15,833
"I don't have the power
to change things."

349
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:18,166
"Someone should do
something about this."

350
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,791
"Someone." "Someone else." 

351
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:23,083
Everyone always
says stuff like that.

352
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:25,458
Sounds like the
right mindset to me.

353
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:33,291
Where the hell did you go?

354
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,583
Maybe you'll come back if
I play with the audience.

355
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:37,416
[KOYUKI]
Ryu! Wake up!

356
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,500
[BERUKIA]
What? Is this brat still alive?

357
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:42,416
Fine.

358
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:45,791
But I'm going back.

359
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:50,541
[BERUKIA] That's what
the little bloodbag gets

360
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:53,958
for ignoring a real
performer like me.

361
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:56,208
[KOYUKI]
Someone! Help us!

362
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:04,291
[MAHIRU]
"Someone." "Someone else."

363
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:06,833
People never want to
do anything themselves.

364
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:09,000
Because it's easier that way.

365
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:12,291
Because you don't have
to take responsibility.

366
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:13,458
But...

367
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:14,791
...the only reason the
world keeps going

368
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:17,208
is because someone
does show up to help.

369
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:18,791
Someone takes a stand.

370
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:21,333
Mahiru!

371
00:16:21,416 --> 00:16:24,125
Take Ryusei and
get outta here!

372
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:27,000
[MAHIRU] I wanted to be
that "someone," too.

373
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:28,875
Nice try, but didn't
anyone ever tell you

374
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:32,916
that showing off is
a good way to get killed?

375
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,375
[KURO] Maybe I should've just
stayed a cat the whole time.

376
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:38,958
This is turning out
to be so exhausting.

377
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:45,166
You're so bothersome
that I could just die.

378
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:51,625
I don't know how you think
I can help in this situation.

379
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:53,416
I'm weak; it's been
hundreds of years

380
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,708
since I've had even
a drop of blood.

381
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:59,958
At this point, I'm practically
more of a cat than a vampire.

382
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:01,708
Kuro...

383
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:03,083
[KURO]
Get out of here.

384
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:05,083
I'll try to stop him,
but I probably can't do much

385
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:06,625
on my own.

386
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:08,708
[TORU] I don't think
I can do this by myself.

387
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:10,708
I'll need your help.

388
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:12,958
I'll try my best
and you can try yours.

389
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:14,125
How's that sound?

390
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:16,458
It's how we'll get
through this, Mahiru.

391
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:21,458
[MAHIRU]
Wait. Is it possible...?

392
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,708
The "someone" we need isn't me.

393
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:25,375
Not quite.

394
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:27,416
It isn't him, either.

395
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,291
No. I think it might be us.

396
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:33,916
Let's do something
about this together!

397
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,083
You with me?

398
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:44,583
[KURO] I knew you were gonna
be trouble from the start.

399
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:47,041
But I didn't think
you'd go this far.

400
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:51,375
[MAHIRU] I'm Mahiru Shirota,
15 years old.

401
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:52,708
I like to keep things simple,

402
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:55,125
and try to keep
life uncomplicated.

403
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:57,041
That's why I picked up a cat.

404
00:17:57,125 --> 00:17:58,500
Well, I thought he was a cat.

405
00:17:58,583 --> 00:17:59,916
But looks can be deceiving.

406
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:03,791
I guess there's
no use fighting it.

407
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:05,500
You're my Eve now.

408
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:07,041
He made a contract.

409
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:09,208
This could be a problem for me.

410
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:11,041
I know what to call
true vampires

411
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:13,166
who make contracts with humans.

412
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:17,000
It's written in the cards here.

413
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:18,583
You are a Servamp!

414
00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:19,875
Meow.

415
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:22,791
[MAHIRU]
The pet I decided to take home

416
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:26,333
ended up being something
else... a vampire.

417
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:28,708
[KURO]
So... what should we do?

418
00:18:34,083 --> 00:18:35,416
We'll defeat him!

419
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:38,250
I think you've read one
too many <i>shonen</i> manga.

420
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:40,375
I really don't want to face him.

421
00:18:47,416 --> 00:18:51,791
Unfortunately, Servamps have
to obey their masters' orders.

422
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:53,166
Fine, then.

423
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:56,833
I take no responsibility
for my actions from now on.

424
00:18:56,916 --> 00:18:58,791
I'll submit to your command.

425
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:13,958
[BERUKIA groans]

426
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:19,291
[MAHIRU]
Kuro.

427
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:21,458
Hold on. That's enough!

428
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:22,791
He can't move anymore.

429
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:25,458
He's not a danger to us. Stop.

430
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:31,500
No! I'm the one who has
to take all the responsibility

431
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:33,125
for your actions now, right?

432
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:35,666
That means you have
to listen to me, Kuro.

433
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:44,875
[BERUKIA] You brat, you brat,
you brat! How dare you?

434
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:46,708
You just boarded
the deadly vampire parade

435
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:48,166
headed straight to hell!

436
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:49,458
[coughs]

437
00:19:49,541 --> 00:19:51,708
It's a runaway train
with no stops in between,

438
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:54,458
you pointless waste of blood!

439
00:19:54,541 --> 00:19:55,541
That's a wrap.

440
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:57,833
I guess I'll end
the show here for now.

441
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:04,666
Uh... What just happened?

442
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:08,833
Is he, uh... dead?

443
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:11,166
[BERUKIA laughs]

444
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:12,500
Of course I'm not!

445
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:17,541
I'm a vampire, you stupid,
stupid, stupid human.

446
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:20,625
Stop! Don't shake me.
I get bad motion sickness.

447
00:20:20,708 --> 00:20:21,958
So who are you?

448
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:23,708
Why would you come
after another vampire,

449
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:25,500
one of your own, like Kuro?

450
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:27,958
[BERUKIA] Because obviously
that's what my orders were.

451
00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:29,375
Your orders?

452
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:31,958
Of course, idiot.
You see I have a master, too.

453
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:34,541
His name's Tsubaki
and does he hate Sloth!

454
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:35,791
Do you hear that?

455
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:39,083
You've got some pretty
powerful enemies, kitty.

456
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:40,958
Maybe, but I don't
think I know anyone

457
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:42,750
by the name of Tsubaki.

458
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:43,583
[BERUKIA]
That's right.

459
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:45,208
You don't know him, Servamp.

460
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:47,541
Poor, poor, poor Tsubaki.

461
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:49,291
No one knows who he is!

462
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:51,291
That's why he wants
blood to rain down.

463
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:55,500
That's why Tsubaki
wants to kill so badly!

464
00:20:55,583 --> 00:20:58,541
To destroy his siblings,
humans, society...

465
00:20:58,625 --> 00:20:59,958
The whole world!

466
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:03,291
He wants everyone who
doesn't know who he is to die!

467
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:05,791
It's not my fault I
don't know who this guy is.

468
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:07,208
What a pain.

469
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:12,958
The chains are gone.
What happened?

470
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:15,000
Did I do something wrong?

471
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:17,333
Whoa, hey, Kuro,
are you all right?

472
00:21:17,416 --> 00:21:19,083
[KURO]
Quite the opposite, really.

473
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:21,833
My body is definitely
going to be sore tomorrow.

474
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:22,958
This is your fault.

475
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:24,791
You're complaining
about sore muscles?

476
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:28,666
[MAHIRU]
I'm glad he's okay, though.

477
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:31,125
He was a little scary just now.

478
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:32,416
But he's back to normal.

479
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,333
So that's... good...

480
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:37,458
[MAHIRU]
Huh?

481
00:21:38,541 --> 00:21:40,375
Why can't I focus?

482
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:42,625
Can someone explain
in simple terms

483
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:44,125
what's happening to me?

484
00:22:08,125 --> 00:22:11,416
[TSUBAKI sighs]
This isn't interesting at all.

485
00:23:42,958 --> 00:23:45,666
[KURO] Fall further for my
cuteness in the next episode!

486
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:46,958
[MAHIRU]
You're not that cute.
