1
00:00:08,041 --> 00:00:09,666
[KURO]
All right, I admit it.

2
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:14,166
This is a pretty nice place to
get away from it all and unwind.

3
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:17,000
To take some time to relax
my body and mind.

4
00:00:17,083 --> 00:00:19,125
[MAHIRU]
Kuro! Where'd you go?

5
00:00:19,208 --> 00:00:20,583
I know you're here somewhere!

6
00:00:20,666 --> 00:00:22,541
He's totally wrecking the vibe.

7
00:00:23,583 --> 00:00:25,916
I hope I'm not intruding.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,666
[MAHIRU]
Huh? Misono?!

9
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:29,125
Where did that bed come from?

10
00:00:29,208 --> 00:00:30,791
You didn't expect me
to sleep on some

11
00:00:30,875 --> 00:00:32,583
cheap futon mattress, did you?

12
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:33,750
Yeah, sure.

13
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:35,500
Will you remind me
who you are again, kid?

14
00:00:35,583 --> 00:00:36,833
[MISONO]
Who are you calling a kid?!

15
00:00:36,916 --> 00:00:39,666
I'm Misono Alicein,
Eve of the Servamp of Lust.

16
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:41,708
Sorry, but we enjoyed
a bath without you.

17
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:43,333
I couldn't be more relaxed.

18
00:00:43,416 --> 00:00:46,000
We're not here on
some kind of vacation!

19
00:00:46,083 --> 00:00:48,291
Am I the only one
taking this seriously?

20
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,666
[MAHIRU]
I don't get it.

21
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:23,958
How is everyone acting
so calm right now?

22
00:02:24,041 --> 00:02:26,875
We have no idea what
Tsubaki's planning to do next.

23
00:02:26,958 --> 00:02:29,166
We don't even know
what our next move is.

24
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:32,916
Push the button
and soda comes out.

25
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,500
It's that simple.

26
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:37,250
[MAHIRU]
Thinking rationally...

27
00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:39,666
What we really need
now is information.

28
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,958
Maybe we could catch one
of Tsubaki's subclasses

29
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:44,166
and convince them to shed
some light on what he's doing

30
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,375
and where he's hiding.

31
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:47,750
That's not a bad idea.

32
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:49,500
When it comes down to it,
we don't actually know

33
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:50,791
anything about him.

34
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:53,291
Or much about Servamps
in general, really.

35
00:02:54,416 --> 00:02:56,208
You should ask him
about our organization

36
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:58,375
the next time you see him.

37
00:02:58,458 --> 00:03:00,250
[MAHIRU] Knowing a little
about vampire history

38
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:02,416
could end up being
really helpful.

39
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,500
You think so?

40
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:04,791
Hey, you know what?

41
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:06,916
I bet that traveling
antique dealer knows more.

42
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,541
The one who showed up
with the Servamp of Envy.

43
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:12,458
It sounded to me like he knew
a whole lot about vampires.

44
00:03:12,541 --> 00:03:14,750
[MISONO] You can't put
your faith in that man.

45
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:16,166
[MAHIRU]
Why not?

46
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:17,458
He's just...

47
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,916
Never mind, forget it.

48
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,625
We'll be fine on our own.

49
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:27,083
[HUGH] Make way for
Pride's perfect landing!

50
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:29,375
Hugh! Where did you fly off to?

51
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:32,875
One of my subclasses
has new information.

52
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:34,708
It might be of some interest.

53
00:03:34,791 --> 00:03:36,166
[MAHIRU]
A suspicious person?

54
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,250
[SAGAMI]
Yeah, and he's really strong.

55
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:40,500
I saw him beat up a
subclass like it was nothing,

56
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:41,958
and then he just flew away.

57
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:44,000
He disappeared into the air!

58
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:44,833
He flew?

59
00:03:44,916 --> 00:03:46,083
[SAGAMI]
Yeah.

60
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:47,750
He was wearing stylish
boots and dark clothes

61
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:49,750
and had big wings on his back.

62
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:50,958
You can't miss 'em.

63
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,875
[MAHIRU]
That's the guy?

64
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:56,166
This kid kinda reeks of danger.

65
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,791
We shouldn't get involved.

66
00:03:57,875 --> 00:03:59,041
Yeah, but what if
he knows something

67
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:00,458
that could lead us to Tsubaki?

68
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:04,083
--[MAHIRU] A hedgehog?
--[KURO] Oh.

69
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:05,125
What is it, Kuro?

70
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:06,208
I know him.

71
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:08,458
Don't tell me it's
another Servamp.

72
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:10,375
Is he asking us to save him?

73
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,291
Why's he in a cage?
We're finding out.

74
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:14,541
[KURO]
C'mon, this is a bad idea.

75
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:18,375
[MAHIRU] You have to learn to
put more faith in our allies.

76
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,875
And trusting their
subclasses, too.

77
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:23,791
Speaking of which,
where are your subclasses?

78
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:27,041
[KURO] I don't have any.
They're too much trouble.

79
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:28,458
In order to make a subclass,

80
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:29,916
you have to give
your blood to a human

81
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,500
on the brink of death.

82
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:34,458
But how do you know if a person
really wants to live any longer?

83
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:37,041
Maybe they wanna die.

84
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:39,916
It's a complicated business.

85
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,291
Thinking about it
makes my head hurt.

86
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:44,291
That's all I have to say.

87
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:45,625
[MAHIRU]
I see.

88
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:48,458
So that's why he doesn't
have any subclasses.

89
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:50,000
But why do I get the
feeling there's more

90
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:51,541
he's not telling me?

91
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,875
[KURO] You sure you're going
to be all right doing this?

92
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:55,750
Tailing someone
alone is dangerous.

93
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:57,083
[MAHIRU]
I'm not alone.

94
00:04:57,166 --> 00:04:59,166
You're here,
so that makes two of us.

95
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,083
I may not be much
help to you yet,

96
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:04,458
but I want us to
become a real team.

97
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:07,375
That means you and I have
to be honest with each other.

98
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:09,250
Whenever you feel like talking,
I want to get to know

99
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:10,416
more about you.

100
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,083
But I'll wait until
you're comfortable.

101
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:17,750
[KURO]
I can't face this right now.

102
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:19,500
You're sure we've
got to follow him?

103
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:22,250
[MAHIRU] Well, Tetsu is big but
he's still a middle schooler.

104
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:25,166
And Misono just got out
of the hospital, so...

105
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,666
Thinking simply, we're the
only ones who can do this.

106
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:33,125
[MAHIRU gasps]

107
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:36,541
Tell me what you are.
Are you angel? Or a demon?

108
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:38,458
Crap, he already noticed us!

109
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:39,666
Way to go.

110
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:48,791
[piano music]

111
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:51,666
A piano? What is this, huh?

112
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:52,833
Kuro?

113
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:54,916
My body feels heavy.

114
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,708
[LICHT]
Ah, so you're the demon.

115
00:05:58,208 --> 00:05:59,250
[MAHIRU]
Kuro!

116
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:03,083
[MAHIRU]
He's fast! And so strong!

117
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:06,000
Kuro's getting
thrashed up there!

118
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:08,666
You better fly, otherwise what's
the use of having a broom?

119
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:13,625
[KURO] My body's not bouncing
back as fast as it should.

120
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:15,416
Just what is this guy?

121
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,000
What's he doing to me?

122
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:19,791
[MAHIRU]
Kuro!

123
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:27,166
What did you do
to my partner?

124
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:29,583
And why do you have
a Servamp in a cage?

125
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:31,416
You can have it
if you want it.

126
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,333
To be honest with you, I've been
trying to get rid of him.

127
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,416
[LAWLESS]
O, speak again, bright angel!

128
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,666
For thou art as glorious
to this night,

129
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:45,458
being o'er my head as is a
winged messenger of heaven.

130
00:06:45,541 --> 00:06:47,041
That's by Shakespeare.

131
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:50,916
I'm the fifth Servamp
Lawless of Greed.

132
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,166
But you can call me Law-ly,

133
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:54,750
or leading man, or
whatever you want. Okay?

134
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:57,208
And this gloomy angel
with a penchant for violence

135
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,416
is my Eve, a real maestro.

136
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,958
Eighteen-year-old Jekylland
Licht Todoroki.

137
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:04,416
Why are you describing me
as though we like each other?

138
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,041
Aw, come on, angel cakes.

139
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:07,791
I just figured I'd do
the introductions

140
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:09,625
since you're so shy
and you'd probably get

141
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:12,166
all mopey if you
had to talk about--Ah!

142
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:13,375
[screams]

143
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:14,541
[MAHIRU]
What are you doing?!

144
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:15,833
[LICHT]
I hate that guy.

145
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:17,916
Wait, but he's
your partner, right?

146
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,208
How can you hate him?

147
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:20,958
Well, see, it's because...

148
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:23,166
...I'm an angel.

149
00:07:24,541 --> 00:07:27,416
That's right!
My reclusive little angel babe!

150
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,541
You're so amazing, in every way!

151
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:31,375
He's the last angel
to travel to Earth.

152
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:32,750
We are not worthy!

153
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:34,750
[LICHT]
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

154
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:36,125
And die!

155
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:37,791
[MAHIRU] I thought we'd met
all the weirdos already.

156
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:39,583
So he's a violent angel.

157
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:41,541
This is just too much.

158
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:43,000
[MAHIRU]
Look at the bright side.

159
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:44,375
We've gained some new allies!

160
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:46,083
[LAWLESS]
No, no, you're mistaken.

161
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:48,041
I have no plans
to work with you.

162
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:50,666
Besides, what do you
need allies for?

163
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,958
[LAWLESS] After all, once
Big Brother makes a decision,

164
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:55,083
he can handle everything
himself, right?

165
00:07:56,666 --> 00:08:00,166
[LAWLESS] Should we kill
Tsubaki or leave him be?

166
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,541
Let's take a majority vote!

167
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:03,833
It'll be just like
the last time. Eh?

168
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:06,000
You really haven't
changed in all these years,

00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:07,833
have you, Big Brother Sloth?

00:08:07,916 --> 00:08:09,750
And that's not a compliment.

[MAHIRU] Hey, wait,
where are you going?

172

You can't fly off already.

173

We're not done here yet.

174
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:20,500
What does a demon's
ally want with me?

175
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,000
We need your help with this.

176
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:24,000
If we're gonna take Tsubaki
down, we need all the power

177
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:25,208
we can get on our side.

178
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:28,000
Tsubaki?
Isn't that a flower's name?

179
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:29,291
You don't know?

180
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:30,500
I figured you attacked us
because you thought

181
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:31,625
we were with him.

182
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:33,666
I'll tell you why I attacked.

183
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:36,250
It's just who I am--an angel.

184
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:37,791
[LAWLESS]
Yes, right, an angel.

185
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:39,541
[MAHIRU]
That's not gonna get old at all.

186
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:41,958
Ah, nothing!
I didn't say a thing!

187
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:45,250
[MAHIRU] I'm not really good
with these intense types.

188
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:46,750
We have a common enemy.

189
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:48,458
Please, help us fight him.

190
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:51,250
Your Servamp might be targeted,
just like all the others have.

191
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:52,625
[LAWLESS laughs]

192
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:54,791
There's no way we'd
be able to work together.

193
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:57,750
I can already tell we'd never
see eye-to-eye on anything.

194
00:08:57,833 --> 00:08:59,666
Right, Big Brother?

195
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,333
Anyway, you've got
Pride and Lust

196
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:03,291
on your side already, don't you?

197
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:05,875
And I guess Envy is
lurking around here, too.

198
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:08,833
That leaves Gluttony and Wrath,
who were never very smart.

199
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:10,125
But still...

200
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:10,833
Even if they are stupid,

201
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:14,125
I bet they haven't
forgotten what you did.

202

[MAHIRU]
Wait...

What's up with these two?

204
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:18,583
Why do they hate each other?

are you talking about?

I'm Mahiru Shirota, Kuro's Eve.

207
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,125
Lawless is your nickname, right?

208
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:28,208
So what's your real name?

209
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:30,041
[LAWLESS]
O Romeo, Romeo!

210
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:31,708
Wherefore art
thou, Romeo?

211
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:33,416
I mean what's in a name?

212
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,625
That which we call a rose
by any other name--

213
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:37,500
ah... would smell as sweet.

214
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:39,625
Parting is such sweet sorrow.

215
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:43,166
[LAWLESS] There's no need
for you to learn my name.

216
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,750
It'll just change
again, eventually.

217
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:48,833
What does that mean?

Damn, if I'm late,
the boss'll kill me.

Why won't you help us? Please!

[LAWLESS] So you're
my brother's Eve, huh?

[TV ANNOUNCER 6A]
Jekylland Licht Todoroki,

228
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:17,708
the genius Austrian pianist,

229
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:21,125
has entranced audiences
across the globe. Now, he's...

230
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:22,416
[MAHIRU]
It's that guy!

231
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,041
He's not very well
known around here,

232
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:26,000
but he's super famous
back in Europe.

233
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:28,416
I hear he's something of
a young piano prodigy.

234
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,666
[TETSU]
There, all dry.

235
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,125
[MAHIRU]
I just met him earlier!

236

He's Greed's Eve!

[HUGH]
Greed, you say?

238
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:36,583
That's too bad.

The boy probably won't live long
enough for another concert.

Why not?

241
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:44,541
[HUGH] Because Lawless has
a habit of killing his Eves

242
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:47,541
once he grows bored of them.

Don't worry.

244

He's the only Servamp who finds
pleasure in hurting his master.

He's broken. Mind and heart.

It would definitely be best
not to get mixed up with him.

[DIRECTOR 6A] We simply
cannot thank you enough.

You're so generous, Tsubaki.

With your continued sponsorship,
the possibilities are endless.

bright future indeed.

Yes, I'm sure he will.

happens, and he dies.

I'm not gonna get in here.

Oh, he's fine.

315
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:40,958
Don't you know that Eves are
stronger than normal people?

316
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:45,916
Besides, if he gets hurt that
easily, then he's useless.

317
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,458
[LAWLESS] Please tell me
you're here for the music

318
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:50,041
and not because you're still
trying to make us best buds.

319
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:51,833
All you really need is Kuro.

320
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:54,208
[MAHIRU] Yeah, I know
that Kuro's strong.

321
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:55,833
But, this isn't the kind
of thing we can do

322
00:13:55,916 --> 00:13:56,833
without more help!

323
00:13:56,916 --> 00:13:59,166
[LAWLESS]
You don't know anything.

324
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:00,583
What's wrong, brother?

325
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:02,125
Haven't you told him?

326
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:03,250
[MAHIRU yells]

327
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:06,958
This is a real pain.

328
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:08,208
Kuro!

329
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:10,666
[LAWLESS] Trying to be
a hero now, eh, Sloth?

330
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:13,541
Fancy yourself as some kind
of loveable main character?

331
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:14,541
You're crazy.

332
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:15,916
[LAWLESS]
So annoying!

333
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,375
You're concerned with the
why and when and where

334
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:19,458
and what of your story,

335
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:21,000
but not how you'll
achieve anything

336
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:23,583
and who you're going
to become in the end.

337
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:27,083
You're just spouting hollow
ideals and playing pretend.

338
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:30,125
You have no real motivation.

339
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:32,833
Since you're
completely clueless,

340
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:35,250
allow me to give you
a brief history lesson.

341
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:37,958
A long time ago,

342
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:40,125
in a certain place
at a certain time,

343
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:43,291
there were seven
darling vampire siblings.

344
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:46,291
Then, a single letter
arrived for us all.

345
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:50,000
It was from a supposedly
neutral party called C3.

346
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:51,625
C3?

347
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:53,750
[LAWLESS]
The letter was a command.

348
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:57,416
The vampires argued
amongst themselves.

349
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,125
And it was decided
that we'd vote

350
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:01,666
on what to do about this order.

351
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:05,500
Greed, Gluttony, and Wrath
were all against the killing.

352
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:07,125
They wouldn't have it!

353
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:10,250
Pride, Envy, And Lust
were all for it,

354
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:13,125
the bloodthirsty vampires.

355
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:14,583
[MAHIRU]
I can feel it.

356
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:16,708
Kuro's murderous intent.

357
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:19,083
It's growing fast,
all around me.

358
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:21,416
Getting stronger.

359
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,916
[MAHIRU]
Something's wrong.

360
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,041
I can't turn around.

361
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:27,750
I feel like if I move at all,
I'll be swallowed up.

362
00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:28,583
[LAWLESS]
Well, then.

363
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:30,583
It was three against three.

364
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:32,666
So what did the
eldest sibling vote?

365
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:35,583
What did he do when someone's
life was in his hands?

366
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:38,208
This is what that
lazy bastard had to say.

367
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:46,708
Wow, you really don't want
him to hear this story, huh?

368
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:48,083
I'm kind of impressed.

369
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:49,458
[laughing]

370
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:51,000
[MAHIRU] I thought we could
become allies without

371
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:52,750
any problems, but...

372
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:54,958
[LAWLESS]
Sleep no more!

373
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:57,000
He does murder sleep!

374
00:15:57,083 --> 00:15:58,333
My poor elder brother,

375
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:01,208
I don't think you're ever
going to find any peace!

376
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:02,666
[MAHIRU] There's so much
hostility between

377
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,541
the two of them.

378
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:07,625
[LAWLESS] You all want to
forget that this ever happened!

379
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:10,625
That's the thing I hate
most about you idiots!

380
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:15,583
[TSUBAKI]
Complete annihilation?

381
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:17,291
[SAKUYA] Otogiri and the
others who were outside

382
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:18,791
managed to escape.

383
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:20,791
But everyone in the hall...

384
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:21,958
Tsu-Tsu, love.

385
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:23,875
Lawless was really strong.

386
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:26,041
[SHAMROCK]
It's true. Please forgive us.

387
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:28,958
[TSUBAKI]
I see.

388
00:16:29,041 --> 00:16:32,791
Everyone, I... apologize.

389
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:35,166
This was a terrible
miscalculation.

390
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:37,333
I should have waited
until Higan returned.

391
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:39,250
[SHAMROCK]
No! Young master!

392

from your hand? [laughs]

No!

Right, brother?

00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:02,958
[LILAC]
I can't believe it.

401
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:04,958
How did this go so badly?

402
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:06,708
There were so many of us here.

going to get to go on

Tsubaki's next mission!
Isn't that amazing?

406
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:15,416
Yeah, he usually never lets
the weaker subclasses join in.

407
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,166
Whatever it is he's planning
must be a really big deal.

408
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:20,875
We'll finally get the chance
to make him proud of us.

409
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:22,541
[LILAC]
We were so excited.

410
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,458
So ready to serve.

411
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:26,791
We were prepared for
violence and chaos.

412
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:30,208
But didn't expect that the
tables would turn against us.

413
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:32,000
We were more than
just subclasses--

to do it alone.

if you injured yourself

00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:08,000
fighting like this?

474
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:09,041
Uh, hi.

Oh. You're that kid.

My name is Rosen Krantz,
Mr. Licht's music manager.

477
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:18,000
I'm just a regular human,
not a vampire.

478

Oh, this big blue guy happens
to be our mascot, Whale.

You can call him Gill.

Uh, nice to meet you.
I'm Mahiru.

[KRANTZ]
We'll help you with your task.

484
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:35,083
Licht's piano is one of
humanity's treasures.

485
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:37,625
It's my duty to make sure
both of them are safe.

486
00:20:37,708 --> 00:20:39,250
The world needs his music!

487
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:40,583
Shut up, Krantz.

488
00:20:40,666 --> 00:20:42,500
You don't get to decide this.

489
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:45,208
He says that, but I'll
convince him. Just you wait.

Thank you very much.

[KRANTZ]
Now.

00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,333
What shall we do
with this child?

[LILAC shrieks]
I'm sorry!

Please don't kill me!

Don't worry,
we're not going to.

But hang on a second.

00:20:56,708 --> 00:20:58,708
I have to talk to my
friends about what to do.

Wait! Come back!

Where are you going?

I'm still not very
good with my weapon,

not like you are.

[LICHT]
Doesn't matter.

You'll never learn.

Uh, well...

have to come along with me
