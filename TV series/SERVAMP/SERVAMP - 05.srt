1
00:00:08,166 --> 00:00:10,333
[MAHIRU]
Dammit. Ah!

2
00:00:10,416 --> 00:00:11,666
[KURO]
What's wrong?

3
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:13,583
[MAHIRU] I can't get this
stupid letter to open.

4
00:00:15,375 --> 00:00:16,666
What's with this seal?

5
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:18,208
It's probably junk.

6
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,083
Y'think? Whatever.

7
00:02:07,958 --> 00:02:10,708
[BERUKIA] You've been in such
a good mood lately, Tsu-Tsu.

8
00:02:10,791 --> 00:02:13,416
[TSUBAKI laughs]
I guess that's true. Pon.

9
00:02:15,833 --> 00:02:18,166
It's a blessed day when
we get to see you smile.

10
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:20,666
I wish it were more often,
young master.

11
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,500
[TSUBAKI]
Pon.

12
00:02:22,583 --> 00:02:24,333
The young master
used my discarded tiles

13
00:02:24,416 --> 00:02:25,500
to improve his game!

14
00:02:25,583 --> 00:02:26,708
[TSUBAKI]
Stop it, Shamrock.

15
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:28,625
You know I hate it
when you call me that.

16
00:02:28,708 --> 00:02:31,041
All right, here I go!

17
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:33,000
[OTOGIRI]
That's ron. I win.

18
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:35,958
You got cocky.
Your carelessness is a problem.

19
00:02:36,041 --> 00:02:37,166
[BERUKIA]
You little witch!

20
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:39,041
You've been picking
on me this whole game!

21
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:40,750
[OTOGIRI] I'll take your
12,000 points now.

22
00:02:40,833 --> 00:02:42,000
Hey, Sham.

23
00:02:42,083 --> 00:02:45,375
How 'bout an update on
the mission I gave you?

24
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:46,750
Right!

25
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,708
You shouldn't be concerned.
Everything's in place.

26
00:02:48,791 --> 00:02:50,750
It is just like you wanted,
young master.

27
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:52,750
[TSUBAKI] I told you to
stop calling me that.

28
00:02:52,833 --> 00:02:55,125
More importantly,
young master...

29
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:56,458
About this liar...

30
00:02:56,541 --> 00:02:59,083
It's only a matter of time
before he betrays you.

31
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:01,458
[TSUBAKI laughing]

32
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:04,166
That's not very
interesting, Shamrock.

33
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:07,875
The eve of the
festival is over.

34
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:09,625
The war is about to begin.

35
00:03:09,708 --> 00:03:12,416
It's time we make things
much more interesting.

36
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,416
The fireworks. The vendors.

37
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,875
The crowds of
unsuspecting humans.

38
00:03:16,958 --> 00:03:18,750
What are you waiting
for, Brother?!

39
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:20,750
Hurry up and take us
to the festival!

40
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:23,291
[laughing]

41
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:24,375
[coughing]

42
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:26,291
--Young master...
--Embarrassing.

43
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:27,333
[TSUBAKI]
Water.

44
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,291
[GIRL STUDENT 5A]
Aw, little Kuro!

45
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:30,666
Here, have some of this egg.

46
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,708
[GIRL STUDENT 5B]
Do you want a cookie?

47
00:03:32,791 --> 00:03:33,875
Look at this cat.

48
00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:35,958
This has to be the best
of his nine lives!

49
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:38,125
It's almost like he understands
what they're saying.

50
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:39,458
Maybe he's a genius.

51
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:44,250
[MAHIRU] It was the end of my
first year in high school.

52
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:46,208
Summer break started
the next day.

53
00:03:47,416 --> 00:03:49,416
Hmm... What are you gonna
do if people find out

54
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,333
you're actually a vampire
and not a normal black cat?

55
00:03:52,416 --> 00:03:54,000
[KURO] Hey, don't get
all mad just because

56
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:55,416
I'm popular with the ladies.

57
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,875
[MAHIRU]
I'm not getting mad!

58
00:03:56,958 --> 00:03:58,541
What if one of them
turns out to be an enemy

59
00:03:58,625 --> 00:03:59,958
trying to get close to you?

60
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:03,208
[KURO] How are you both
paranoid and too trusting?

61
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:04,750
Forget about it.

62
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:07,125
Just watch me roll around in
your hands and be cute instead.

63
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:08,541
[MAHIRU]
You're not helping!

64
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:15,166
[MAHIRU]
This takes me back.

65
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,333
I came here with my uncle
when I was little.

66
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:18,583
Kuro?

67
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:21,583
What the--Where'd you go?!

68
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:24,791
How'd you manage to get
all that food so quickly?!

69
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:27,125
[KURO] Never underestimate
a hungry vampire.

70
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:30,583
[MAHIRU]
The fireworks will start soon.

71
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:33,291
[SHAMROCK]
Excuse me.

72
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:36,916
I found this case.

73
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,958
Someone must have lost it.

74
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:40,666
I'm in a bit of a hurry now.

75
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,916
Could you take it to the
lost and found for me?

76
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,125
I'm afraid I just
don't have time to.

77
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:47,791
Please make sure
you get it there

78
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:49,666
before the fireworks begin.

79
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:56,291
[MAHIRU]
Well...

80
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:58,375
I guess it's the
simplest thing to do.

81
00:04:58,458 --> 00:04:59,958
I'll be right back, Kuro.

82
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:05,708
Oh, wow, it's
so crowded... Ah!

83
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:07,250
[TETSU]
Oh. Sorry.

84
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:08,958
No. It was my fault.

85
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:10,000
Thanks.

86
00:05:10,791 --> 00:05:12,416
[MAHIRU]
So tall!

87
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,250
And what's with that giant box?

88
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:15,416
[TETSU]
I didn't see you.

89
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,291
I'm on the lookout
for someone else.

90
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:18,333
A friend?

91
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:20,500
Eh, someone
I got separated from.

92
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:21,750
Well, in that case,

93
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:23,333
you should just page them
over the intercom.

94
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:24,458
Simple.

95
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:26,291
That's a good idea.
How do I do that?

96
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:27,916
I'm heading to the lost
and found right now,

97
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,708
and they should
be able to help you.

98
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:31,000
Just come along with me.

99
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:32,208
Thanks a lot!

100
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:33,791
You're a big help.

101
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,625
The guy I'm looking for
is kind of odd,

102
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:38,250
so I'll notice if we
pass him on the way there.

103
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:39,708
Okay, works for me.

104
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:43,750
[MAHIRU]
The shape of that thing...

105
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:45,375
It looks like--

106
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:47,916
[MAHIRU]
Uh... So about that box.

107
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,125
Oh, this?

108
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:51,375
It's just a coffin, bro.

109
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:52,375
[MAHIRU]
And, uh...

110
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:54,000
Why do you have it, exactly?

111
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:55,791
[TETSU] Well like
I said, it's a coffin--

112
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:58,208
so obviously it's for
vampires to sleep in.

113
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:01,000
[MAHIRU]
Could it be...?

114
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:03,166
Is this guy another vampire?

115
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:05,250
If you live around here,
you probably know that--

116
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:08,000
[CROWD MAN 5A]
Holy crap! What was that?

117
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:09,250
An explosion?

118
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:10,458
[CROWD MAN 5B]
Whoa, what happened?

119
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:11,708
[CROWD WOMAN 5A]
Someone said a bag exploded.

120
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:13,583
[CROWD MAN 5C]
Yeah, it was a silver briefcase.

121
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:16,500
[SHAMROCK] Please make
sure you get it there

122
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:18,416
before the fireworks begin.

123
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,416
[MAHIRU] The fireworks start at
seven sharp, right?

124
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,625
Okay, calm down.

125
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:24,125
If this is a bomb,
I can call Kuro

126
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:25,750
and have him take it far away.

127
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:27,666
But what about this guy?
Is he in on it?

128
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,333
Is this a trap?

129
00:06:29,416 --> 00:06:33,291
[KURO] How are you both
paranoid and too trusting?

130
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:34,833
Listen.

131
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:37,833
Would I be right in assuming
you're a good, rational person?

132
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:39,750
Hmm... I guess so.

133
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:41,166
[MAHIRU]
I may be too trusting,

134
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:43,166
but I'd rather give people
the benefit of the doubt.

135
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:45,250
If I get tricked,
I'll worry about it then.

136
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:47,416
Things are simpler that way.

137
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,000
Huh... That's a
smart way of thinking.

138
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:51,916
[CROWD screaming]

139
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,041
Kuro!

140
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:56,833
[KURO] You need to get it
away from people?

141
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,041
The sky'll do.

142
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
He's a Servamp.

143
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:01,833
[MAHIRU]
C'mon!

144
00:07:01,916 --> 00:07:03,750
Throw it as hard as you can!

145
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:05,208
That's not gonna
be high enough!

146
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:07,458
If that thing falls back
down on us, we're dead!

147
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:09,416
[KURO]
Meh. This'll be fine.

148
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,416
These situations
always work out.

149
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,125
The bag'll explode in the
air while we watch.

150
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:16,750
[MAHIRU] No, it's already
coming back down!

151
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:17,958
[SHAMROCK]
Young master!

152
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:19,375
Are you seeing this?

153
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:21,166
It's finally beginning!

154
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:23,625
The curtain's rising
on our grand funeral!

155
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:25,583
[TSUBAKI laughs]

156
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:27,958
Now, now, troubled world.

157
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:32,291
Won't you come out and play?

158
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:36,208
[TETSU]
Got it.

159
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:38,666
[MAHIRU]
How's that gonna help?

160
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,333
Everything's fine now.

161
00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:41,708
Just watch.

162
00:07:41,791 --> 00:07:44,166
Absolutely nothing can
destroy this coffin of mine.

163
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,708
[MAHIRU]
Hot springs?

164
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:55,041
Okay... Just who in
the hell are you, man?

165
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:56,875
Tetsu Sendagaya.

166
00:07:56,958 --> 00:07:59,375
You may know my family's
hot springs resort.

167
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:01,916
[MAHIRU]
Huh?

168
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,458
[HUGH]
You fool!

169
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:07,833
I can't believe you
blew up the coffin

170
00:08:07,916 --> 00:08:11,083
even though I was... inside!

171
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:13,375
[TETSU]
Hugh? You were in there?

172
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:14,958
I've been looking
for you everywhere.

173
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:16,125
I thought you'd disappeared.

174
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:17,041
[MAHIRU]
Hugh?

175
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:18,791
[KURO]
Oh, long time no see.

176
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:20,708
This is the Servamp of Pride.

177
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:21,791
Old Child.

178
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:22,916
[MAHIRU]
A Servamp?!

179
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:25,541
[MISONO]
Yes.

180
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:27,708
I should be back
home by next week.

181
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:30,625
My injuries are mostly healed.
I'm just resting now.

182
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:32,416
No need for concern.

183
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,541
Thank you for calling.
I know you're very busy.

184
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:36,708
Bye, Father.

185
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:40,791
[LILLY] Make sure you're not
rushing yourself, Misono.

186
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:43,500
We'll have plenty of
opportunities to help Mahiru out

187
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:45,000
once you've fully recovered.

188
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:46,416
I promise.

189
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:50,083
Doudou told me earlier
that you-know-who is in town.

190
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:54,208
Makes me wonder what
he could be planning.

191
00:08:58,875 --> 00:09:01,291
[TETSU] Okay, Hugh,
you've had some of my blood.

192
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:04,000
Have you recovered yet,
or do you need some more?

193
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:05,791
[HUGH]
I'm fine, of course.

194
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:08,250
Don't mistake me for
someone who's easily beaten.

195
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:09,583
I embody strength!

196
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:11,875
My name is Hugh
the Dark Algernon III,

197
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:13,791
and I am the
mightiest of Servamps,

198
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:15,250
the true form of Pride!

199
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:17,208
Quake in fear before me!

200
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:20,000
[MAHIRU] Um... Are you sure
you're completely recovered?

201
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:22,041
You fool! Weren't you
listening to me?

202
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:24,625
Or maybe terror is keeping
you from thinking straight

203
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:26,958
in the presence of
a ferocious vampire.

204
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:29,750
Yeah, so, uh...
I can call you "Hugh," then?

205
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:31,541
[HUGH]
You'll use my full name, human.

206
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:33,166
[KURO]
That's way too long.

207
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:36,500
[HUGH] Yes, it has been
a long time, Sleepy Ash.

208
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:38,375
While you were off
lazing around,

209
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:41,208
the world fell into
chaos thanks to him.

210
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:42,250
You mean Tsubaki?

211
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:44,708
[HUGH]
Before we get into all that,

212
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:46,750
why don't I tell you the
story of how I met up

213
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:47,875
with Tetsu here?

214
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:49,375
[MAHIRU]
Why would we care?

215
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:51,500
[HUGH] I had followed the scent
of some high-quality blood

216
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:54,083
to a hot springs inn, where I
intended to find a person

217
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:57,125
worthy of being Pride's Eve.

218
00:09:57,208 --> 00:09:59,833
[TETSU] A customer?
We have some nice rooms vacant.

219
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:03,083
You'll find that they're
reasonably priced.

220
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:06,625
I can't stay in a room that
allows so much sunlight in!

221
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:08,166
[TETSU]
A vampire?

222
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:10,166
[HUGH]
Don't you know anything?!

223
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:13,583
[TETSU'S DAD]
What are you doing, Tetsu?

224
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:16,875
That room has our best view!
[whining]

225
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:19,291
[HUGH] Tetsu's young,
but he's got top-notch blood,

226
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:21,166
physical strength,
and common sense.

227
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:22,583
We were a perfect match.

228
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:24,708
[MAHIRU chuckles]
Young, huh?

229
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,791
I don't know if
I'd call him that.

230
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:28,666
Though I guess when
you're an ageless vampire,

231
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,541
all humans seem like kids.

232
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:32,500
[HUGH]
Tetsu is only 14 years old.

233
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:34,125
14 years old?

234
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:36,166
Gah! You're in middle school?!

235
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:37,541
Second year.

236
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:39,125
And here I was thinking
you were a college student!

237
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:40,625
[HUGH]
Observe!

238
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:42,916
This grand weapon proves just
how great his potential is

239
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,083
as an Eve!

240
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:45,625
[MAHIRU] This giant coffin
is your weapon?

241
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:47,375
Yeah, I don't know
how to get rid of it.

242
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:50,458
So I figured I could use it
for some free advertising.

243
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:52,458
[MAHIRU]
That's actually pretty smart.

244
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:54,625
Well, if the
customer's a vampire,

245
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:58,125
then it's my job as an innkeeper
to prepare a dark room for him.

246
00:10:58,208 --> 00:10:59,625
That's just good business.

247
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:02,208
Tourist destinations don't
do well if there's fighting,

248
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:04,833
so I do everything I can to
keep the peace between humans

249
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:06,791
and vampires.

250
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,666
[HUGH]
No question about it.

251
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:11,791
This was the work
of Tsubaki's men.

252
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:13,250
[MAHIRU]
You know that for sure?

253
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:15,583
[HUGH] I have more subclasses
than any other Servamp

254
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:18,291
because I like to stay
well-informed about the world.

255
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:20,750
We were on high alert today
because of certain information

256
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:23,125
we had received earlier.

257
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:25,333
It would probably be best
for us to stay in contact

258
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:26,541
and help each other out.

259
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:28,875
We can face Tsubaki together.

260
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:29,666
Yeah!

261
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,708
This is such a to-do.

262
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:32,791
Be warned.

263
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:34,833
Tsubaki isn't the
only player here.

264
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:38,458
There are other enemies
that we must watch out for.

265
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:40,458
Great, even more work.

266
00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:47,708
[MAHIRU] Misono, Tetsu, and
that traveling antique dealer.

267
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:49,500
Right, that makes four Eves.

268
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:50,916
I hope the other
Eves and Servamps

269
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,458
are willing to
work with us, too.

270
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:54,583
That could make
things a lot easier.

271
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:56,583
--[KURO yawns]
--How are you tired? Ah!

272
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:00,458
[KURO]
Mahiru?

273
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:10,500
Ha ha! Looks like I'm
gonna rake in some cash.

274
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:14,333
[MAHIRU]
Where am I?

275
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:16,333
Where's Kuro?
What's going on?

276
00:12:16,416 --> 00:12:18,833
[TSUYUKI] Most potential
problems are easily avoided

277
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:20,458
if you're always prepared.

278
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:22,458
I'm sure you must be thirsty.

279
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:23,708
Help yourself.

280
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:26,583
I prepared this spread
especially for you.

281
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:27,958
If you'd like something else,

282
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:30,500
I can have other
options brought in.

283
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,041
No thanks. I'm okay.

284
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:34,625
Don't I... know you?

285
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:38,916
I'm Tsuyuki, and I work
for a group called C3.

286
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,166
We're a neutral party between
humans and vampires.

287
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:44,458
[MAHIRU]
Neutral party?

288
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:45,500
[TSUYUKI]
Yes.

289
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:48,666
I am your ally, Mahiru Shirota.

290
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:51,083
I apologize for the unusual
way we brought you here,

291
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:52,666
but it couldn't be helped.

292
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:55,291
There's an important question to
which we must have an answer.

293
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:56,791
Will you work with us?

294
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:58,708
Will you help us stop Tsubaki?

295
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:02,250
[MAHIRU]
Um... Hold on a sec.

296
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:04,250
This is all really sudden.

297
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:06,958
[TSUYUKI] One of C3's top
priorities is to create harmony

298
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:08,750
between vampires and humans.

299
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:10,291
To ensure peace.

300
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:12,500
As you can imagine,
Tsubaki's existence

301
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:14,166
is a threat to that mission.

302
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:15,708
In order to guarantee success,

303
00:13:15,791 --> 00:13:18,458
we need all the power
we can get on our side.

304
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:20,125
That's why we've
brought you here today.

305
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:23,208
We'd like your Servamp
to work with us.

306
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:25,083
You should ask him
about our organization

307
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:26,875
the next time you see him.

308
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:29,333
I'm sure he knows all about us.

309
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:30,541
[MAHIRU]
Really?

310
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:32,208
[TSUYUKI] Our goals
are the same, Mahiru.

311
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:34,583
There's no reason to
refuse this partnership.

312
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:38,708
Sure, but...
I need to talk to Kuro about it.

313
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:41,083
And how could you be running
an organization like this

314
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:42,791
if you're a high school student?

315
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:46,916
[TSUYUKI]
I'm 22 years old. I'm an adult.

316
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,666
[MAHIRU]
But I ran into you at my school!

317
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:50,791
[TSUYUKI] I was only there
in order to come in contact

318
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:51,958
with you.

319
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:54,458
It was all part
of my preparation.

320
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:56,625
[MAHIRU] I thought he
was just a year above me.

321
00:13:56,708 --> 00:13:58,958
When did I get so bad
at telling people's ages?

322
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:01,291
It's our responsibility
to capture Tsubaki

323
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:03,041
and get him off of the streets.

324
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:06,458
You see, he was once a
Servamp that C3 was using

325
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:07,958
in their research.

326
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:09,291
[MAHIRU]
What do you mean?

327
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:11,250
[TSUYUKI] It was before
I joined the organization,

328
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:13,333
so I wasn't actually involved.

329
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:15,250
I've only read about it
in the archives.

330
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:17,500
[MAHIRU] Wait, hold on,
back up a little bit.

331
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:20,791
So, Tsubaki used to be
part of C3 or something?

332
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:22,791
[TSUYUKI] I'll tell you all
the details once you commit

333
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:24,291
to working with us.

334
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:27,125
Again, there's no
reason to say "no."

335
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:28,291
[MAHIRU]
But--

336
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:29,583
[TSUYUKI]
Tsubaki's gotten out of control.

337
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:32,416
And we've taken too long
to prepare on offense.

338
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:36,208
We must band together to break
Tsubaki and his subclasses.

339
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:39,000
There is simply
no other way, Mahiru.

340
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:40,291
[MAHIRU]
Break them?

341
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:42,000
You mean murder them.

342
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:44,666
You want to kill them all.

343
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:47,708
Then sorry, I can't help you.

344
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:51,166
One of those subclasses
is my best friend!

345
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:53,875
And I promised
that I'd save him!

346
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:57,416
You're talking about Sakuya.
That correct?

347
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,833
[MAHIRU]
You... know?

348
00:14:58,916 --> 00:15:00,958
Yes. In order to prepare
for our little meeting today,

349
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:03,875
I looked through the information
we had collected on you.

350
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:05,083
[MAHIRU]
What?

351
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:06,833
It's time to stop acting
like a spoiled child

352
00:15:06,916 --> 00:15:09,166
and be mature about this.

353
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:11,458
Trust the adults
and the good people

354
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:13,958
working at C3
to improve society.

355
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:17,833
Your personal feelings
have no place in this matter.

356
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:20,375
[MAHIRU] What makes you
think you know what's best?

357
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:22,833
Sitting there drinking black
coffee and calling me a child

358
00:15:22,916 --> 00:15:24,541
doesn't make you mature.

359
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:26,125
And if adults murder,

360
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:28,791
then I'll stay a kid who
likes chugging orange soda!

361
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:36,416
[TSUYUKI]
I see. And I understand.

362
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,625
You have the right to refuse us.

363
00:15:38,708 --> 00:15:40,958
[MAHIRU]
Yeah, I do. See ya!

364
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:44,708
[TSUYUKI] However, there's a
total of 52 doors in this room,

365
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:47,625
and I'm afraid only one
of them leads outside.

366
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:50,041
[TSUYUKI] Please, feel free
to see yourself out.

367
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:51,541
I'd hurry up, though.

368
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:53,541
Or you'll never see Sloth again.

369
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,958
[KURO]
This is such a pain.

370
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:00,291
[KURO grunting]

371
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:01,166
[TSURUGI]
Whoops.

372
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:03,208
You're one slippery target, cat.

373
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:07,250
Sorry, Tsurugi, my coordinates
were a little bit off.

374
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:09,750
[TSURUGI] It's fine. You've been
out of the field for a while.

375
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:12,333
And you've gotten fat raising
that new kid of yours.

376
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:14,791
[JUNICHIRO] C'mon!
I barely gained any weight!

377
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:21,875
[YUMIKAGE]
Tsurugi!

378
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:24,000
Stop the useless
chatter and focus.

379
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:25,000
[chuckles]

380
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:26,750
Sure. Apologies, Yumi.

381
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:29,666
[KURO]
Oh, I get it. You're from C3.

382
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:32,500
[TSURUGI]
Tsurugi Kamiya. Age 26.

383
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:34,541
I'm the kinda scum who'd
kill his whole family

384
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:35,833
if the price was right.

385
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:37,458
Seriously, I'll lick
your boots right now

386
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:38,500
if you pay me to do it.

387
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:39,416
[YUMIKAGE]
Will you please shut up?

388
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,416
[TSURUGI]
Ha ha!

389
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,625
[YUMIKAGE sighs]

390
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:43,208
If you'd come when
you got that letter,

391
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:45,666
then we wouldn't have had to
go through all this trouble.

392
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:48,250
It's your own fault.

393
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:49,875
[MAHIRU]
What are you doing to Kuro?

394
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:51,291
Where is he?

395
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:53,666
Your Servamp's currently
with expert vampire hunters--

396
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:56,041
the most talented
team that C3 has.

397
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:59,125
I'm positive they're
getting Sloth some exercise.

398
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:01,208
Vampire hunters? Seriously?

399
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:06,166
[TSURUGI]
Do you really have to run away?

400
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:09,541
I should ask for a bonus on top
of my flat rate for this job.

401
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:12,125
Vampires have a different
name for the hunters.

402
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:14,458
[YUMIKAGE]
Go, earn your pay, Tsurugi!

403
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:16,916
[TSUYUKI] They call them
the mad dogs of C3.

404
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:25,000
[MAHIRU]
Kuro. I've got to get to him!

405
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,041
[MAHIRU]
This way!

406
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:33,083
Welcome back, Mahiru.

407
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:35,291
At this rate, it will
probably take you all day

408
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:38,041
before you find your way out.

409
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:39,791
Do you know about
the maximum limit

410
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:42,291
between an Eve and Servamp?

411
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:44,333
If you stay apart from
each other for too long,

412
00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:46,166
you'll start to
feel pretty sick.

413
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:48,291
Eventually, you'll die
from the separation.

414
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:49,166
[MAHIRU]
Huh?

415
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:51,125
I'll kill that lazy cat myself!

416
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:54,000
How could he forget to tell
me something so important?!

417
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:56,666
[TSUYUKI]
You only have two options here.

418
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:59,083
You can find the
way out yourself,

419
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:00,833
or you can agree
to work with us.

420
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:02,208
Why would I wanna
work with someone

421
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:04,208
who's putting me
through crap like this?!

422
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:05,666
[door slams]

423
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:08,166
Have teenagers always
been this childish?

424
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:09,958
Surely I was never like this.

425
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,166
You're just wasting your time
trying to get away from us.

426
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:18,166
I mean, we do have
your Eve in our care.

427
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:20,250
We've got the upper
hand right now.

428
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:21,375
[KURO]
Mahiru...

429
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:28,625
[TSUYUKI]
Now, then.

430
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:30,083
Are you ready to
act like an adult

431
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:31,750
and make the right decision?

432
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:33,916
Decision?

433
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,625
[MAHIRU]
All of this...

434
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:37,833
It's just to force me
to work with them.

435
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:41,083
They've prepared this elaborate
trap so I have no other choice.

436
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:43,208
I have to comply.

437
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:45,958
But is there really only
one way to get outta here?

438
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:48,291
Only one way to save Kuro?

439
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:50,750
[TSUYUKI] You must realize that
the only real option you have

440
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:52,000
is to listen to us.

441
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:53,458
To join our cause.

442
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:55,041
You don't have much of a choice.

443
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:56,833
You're actually right
about one thing.

444
00:18:56,916 --> 00:18:58,500
My choice is simple!

445
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:03,875
The so-called adults may have
prepared a "correct" answer.

446
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:05,208
But I've got a better idea.

447
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:06,833
What, are you breakdancing?

448
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:10,083
[MAHIRU] Kuro and I will
decide what to do on our own!

449
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:13,541
[MAHIRU yelling]

450
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:24,541
[TSUYUKI]
Unfortunately, you found it.

451
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:26,750
Another way out.

452
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:29,083
Let me warn you about
something, Mahiru.

453
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:31,125
You trust that Servamp,
but you shouldn't.

454
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:33,333
He will be your downfall.

455
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:35,833
That thing is not your friend.

456
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:37,250
It's a vampire.

457
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:41,375
And all they do is suck
the lives out of people.

458
00:19:41,458 --> 00:19:44,041
Every vampire must be broken.

459
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:46,416
Tsubaki is just the beginning.

460
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,250
You want them broken?

461
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:50,791
Why do you keep using that word?

462
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:53,166
Why do you wanna break them?

463
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:55,458
Maybe you've never seen a
vampire rolling on the floor

464
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:59,125
while playing video games
and eating potato chips.

465
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:01,208
Or a vampire who
apologizes for lying

466
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:03,458
while crying tears of regret.

467
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:06,125
Or a vampire who just
wants to be left alone.

468
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:09,791
But will still save the
life of a human he just met.

469
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,833
I've been around
many vampires lately,

470
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:14,375
and believe me,
not all of them are bad.

471
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:16,750
In fact, some of them
are new friends!

472
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,750
I don't really know what kind
of history C3 has with vampires,

473
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:23,333
or what you're trying to do.

474
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:27,000
But thinking simply, I want to
keep anyone from getting hurt.

475
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:28,708
Human or vampire.

476
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:32,250
[TSUYUKI]
There's someone I know.

477
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:36,708
His father was
murdered by vampires.

478
00:20:36,791 --> 00:20:40,625
Even after ten years,
the pain hasn't gone away.

479
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,583
No. Never mind.

480
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:56,166
[KURO]
I don't wanna deal with this.

481
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:57,625
[MAHIRU]
Kuro!

482
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:06,958
[TSURUGI]
What should we do? Chase them?

483
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:10,083
[phone ringing]

484
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:11,583
Hello?

485
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:12,916
Yeah, understood.

486
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:16,125
[YUMIKAGE]
That's it, we're done here.

487
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:17,416
[TSURUGI] Aw, man,
I really thought we might

488
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,833
earn a bonus tonight.

489
00:21:18,916 --> 00:21:21,291
[JUNICHIRO] Well,
at least none of us got hurt.

490
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:22,625
We should get some food.

491
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:23,958
[TSURUGI, YUMIKAGE]
One, two, three, not buying!

492
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:25,916
[JUNICHIRO] What?
I am not buying you guys dinner.

493
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:29,000
[MAHIRU]
Thinking in simple terms,

494
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:32,958
you don't have to have an
excuse to help other people.

495
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:35,041
But if you hate someone,

496
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:37,166
if you hurt another person,

497
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:39,083
you must have a reason.

498
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:42,625
I want to know.

499
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:44,875
Why did Tsubaki start this war?

500
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:47,125
[KURO] Don't act cool when you
can't even control your broom!

501
00:21:47,208 --> 00:21:50,083
[MAHIRU] I thought I was
getting good at this!

502
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:51,208
[MAHIRU yelling]

503
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:53,666
[LAWLESS]
Oh Romeo, Romeo,

504
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,958
where for art thou, Romeo?

505
00:21:57,916 --> 00:22:00,291
What odd twist of fate
has brought us together,

506
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:01,333
Big Brother?

507
00:22:01,416 --> 00:22:03,416
And at a time
like this, no less.

508
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,500
[HUGH] If you need to relax,
you should really try out

509
00:23:44,583 --> 00:23:45,500
a hot spring!

510
00:23:45,583 --> 00:23:47,041
[TETSU]
Thanks for the plug, Hugh.
