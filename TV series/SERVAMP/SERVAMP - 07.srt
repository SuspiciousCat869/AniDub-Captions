1
00:00:07,666 --> 00:00:08,958
[MISONO sighs]

2
00:00:09,041 --> 00:00:10,708
I never would have
thought an outdoor bath

3
00:00:10,791 --> 00:00:13,500
could be so nice,
but this is great.

4
00:00:13,583 --> 00:00:16,375
I'm having one put in at
home as soon as I return.

5
00:00:16,458 --> 00:00:17,708
[LILLY]
I meant to tell you.

6
00:00:17,791 --> 00:00:19,625
Mahiru went out to do some
investigating earlier.

7
00:00:19,708 --> 00:00:22,291
Gah! He's always
going off on his own!

8
00:00:22,375 --> 00:00:23,250
[yells]

9
00:00:23,333 --> 00:00:24,375
[LILLY]
Misono?

10
00:01:57,958 --> 00:02:00,875
[MISONO] So Tsubaki's
plans were foiled again.


11
00:02:00,958 --> 00:02:03,208
You idiot! Why do you
keep going after him alone?

12
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:04,916
You're lucky Lawless
was so strong.

13
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,125
Don't you know what
would have happened

14
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:08,208
if you'd walked into
that trap without help?!

15
00:02:08,291 --> 00:02:09,916
I know, I'm sorry.

16
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,541
By the way, what
happened to your head?

17
00:02:11,625 --> 00:02:13,375
That's none of your concern.

18
00:02:13,458 --> 00:02:15,625
Misono's right; that
could've been really bad.

19
00:02:15,708 --> 00:02:17,291
[MAHIRU] It's not like I went
there looking for a fight

20
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:18,375
or anything.

21
00:02:18,458 --> 00:02:19,875
Regardless of
your poor judgment,

22
00:02:19,958 --> 00:02:22,875
capturing one of Tsubaki's
subclasses is a big win.

23
00:02:22,958 --> 00:02:24,416
[TETSU]
Yeah, way to go, Mahiru.

24
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,458
You got so much stuff
done while shorty here

25
00:02:26,541 --> 00:02:28,041
was relaxing out
in the hot spring.

26
00:02:28,125 --> 00:02:29,708
Don't call me that! You idiot!

27
00:02:29,791 --> 00:02:32,291
I am not short!
You're just freakishly tall!

28
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:33,833
Have some respect!

29
00:02:33,916 --> 00:02:36,291
Anyway, I'm not so
sure it's a good idea

30
00:02:36,375 --> 00:02:39,083
to have this subclass roaming
around the inn so freely.

31
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:40,708
In fact, we should think
about restraining him

32
00:02:40,791 --> 00:02:41,958
in some form or fashion.

33
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:43,916
Wait, but Lila's no trouble.

34
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,125
Oh, come on,
don't be so naive.

35
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:49,750
He might be pretending to be
weak so we let our guards down.

36
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:51,291
Maybe I am too trusting.

37
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:52,500
Heard that before.

38
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:54,666
I'm not saying you
shouldn't trust others.

39
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,083
But you should keep all
possibilities in mind.

40
00:02:57,166 --> 00:02:59,416
[HUGH] Before we do anything,
we should get some info.

41
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,375
You'll be a good lad
and tell us where Tsubaki

42
00:03:01,458 --> 00:03:03,500
and his men are hiding, right?

43
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:06,708
I mean, you don't have
much of a choice, really.

44
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:09,083
Take it down a notch,
Hugh. Okay?

45
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:10,666
I've been thinking
about all this.

46
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:11,791
[MISONO]
And...?

47
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:13,875
If Tsubaki finds out
that we have Lila,

48
00:03:13,958 --> 00:03:17,458
then isn't it possible he might
come to us to save his subclass?

49
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:18,791
[MISONO]
Huh... You think?

50
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:20,125
For just one subclass?

51
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:22,333
Remember when we defeated
Berukia on the street?

52
00:03:22,416 --> 00:03:24,500
Tsubaki showed up himself,
which was the first time

53
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:25,875
that I met him.

54
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:27,291
I'd thought he was there
because he had some business

55
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:29,333
with Kuro, but...

56
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:31,041
I think he actually might've
been there to make sure

57
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:33,291
Berukia was okay.

58
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:34,208
He cares.

59
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:36,958
[SAKUYA]
I can't betray him.

60
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:38,625
Tsubaki was the only one.

61
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:41,333
He reached out his hand to me.

62
00:03:41,416 --> 00:03:43,458
[MAHIRU] If one of your
subclass children got taken,

63
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:45,250
wouldn't you go and
try to save them?

64
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:47,208
Well, yes, obviously I would.

65
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:49,291
But it's hard to believe
Tsubaki would do that.

66
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:51,375
But you have to admit
it's a possibility.

67
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:52,791
Right, Kuro?

68
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:53,833
Huh?

69
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:00,083
Kuro?

70
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:03,125
Wait up!

71
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:09,166
Hey. Is everything okay?

72
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:18,500
[MAHIRU]
Kuro's being weird.

73
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:20,500
He hasn't been himself since
Lawless brought up that stuff

74
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:21,666
from the past.

75
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,333
I wonder...

76
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:24,208
[MAHIRU]
What happened to you?

77
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:25,750
Who did you kill?

78
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:27,375
Why did you have to kill him?

79
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:30,625
Did you agree with
the majority vote?

80
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:33,000
--To be, or not to be?
--[MAHIRU] Should I ask him?

81
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:34,750
Or just leave him alone?

82
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:36,083
If we don't fix this rift,

83
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:38,458
Lawless will probably
never work with us.

84
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:40,416
And we need him.

85
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,166
Kuro!

86
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,875
What happened when you guys--?

87
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:54,291
[MAHIRU]
Never mind...

88
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:57,041
Let's go back.
Everyone's waiting.

89
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,375
[meows]

90
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:13,958
[MAHIRU] Lately, I've been
thinking a lot about

91
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:15,750
what it means to have resolve.

92
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,125
[overlapping voices]

93
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:24,458
Back then, though, I still
didn't know the meaning

94
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:25,583
of the word.

95
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:30,000
[MAHIRU] Um, I'm really
sorry about everything.

96
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:33,041
I guess we're all just a
little on edge, you know.

97
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:36,250
[MAHIRU]
Want some?

98
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:42,708
[LILAC]
Um, Mahiru?

99
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:45,666
Why are you going out of
your way to take care of me?

100
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,208
I'm your enemy.

101
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:49,791
And I'm just causing
you more trouble.

102
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:51,750
[MAHIRU]
Huh?

103
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:53,833
[LILAC] You even got
into a fight with Greed.

104
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:56,791
For me. To make sure
he didn't kill me.

105
00:05:56,875 --> 00:05:58,625
Don't get me wrong,
I appreciate it.

106
00:05:58,708 --> 00:06:00,458
But I don't know
how to thank you.

107
00:06:00,541 --> 00:06:01,833
Or if I should.

108
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:05,625
[MAHIRU]
Well, you say you're my enemy,

109
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:08,208
but it's not like I want
to fight Tsubaki.

110
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:10,708
I just don't want
people to get hurt.

111
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:12,375
I mean, sure, there are
times when fighting's

112
00:06:12,458 --> 00:06:14,041
the only option.

113
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:16,750
But us killing each other
isn't going to help anything.

114
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:19,166
[KURO]
What are you saying, Mahiru?

115
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,583
That sounds nice.

116
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:22,416
But in reality, you're wrong.

117
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,166
You sound like a child when you
say things like this, Mahiru.

118
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,416
[LILAC]
I don't want to fight, either.

119
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,916
I guess I could thank you
with some advice.

120
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,541
If and when you face Tsubaki,

121
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:33,708
make sure you
watch out for Higan.

122
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:37,083
He's the strongest
and most dangerous

123
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:38,833
of the subclasses.

124
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:40,833
Ruthless and powerful.

125
00:06:40,916 --> 00:06:44,291
That's why he's Tsubaki's
number two man.

126
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:46,708
[MAHIRU]
Tsubaki's number two?

127
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:51,875
[MAHIRU groans]

128
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:53,916
It's way too early to be up.

129
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,625
After everything that
happened yesterday,

130
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:59,291
I guess I've got too much
on my mind to sleep in.

131
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:01,541
Plus now I've got this
dangerous guy Lila mentioned

132
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:03,208
to worry about.

133
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:05,416
At least we're getting
more people on our side.

134
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:10,250
[MAHIRU]
Kuro? Did you not sleep at all?

135
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:13,625
[MAHIRU]
Hey.

136
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:17,458
[phone ringing]

137
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:18,458
[MAHIRU]
Hello?

138
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:20,000
[KRANTZ]
Good morning!

139
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:22,166
Sorry for calling so early.
This is Krantz, from yesterday.

140
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:23,083
Licht's manager?

141
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:24,583
I hate to bother you,

142
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:27,541
but do you have any idea
where Lawless is right now?

143
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:29,833
[LICHT] Dammit, where is
that rotten hedgehog?

144
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:31,291
He's not in your room, is he?

145
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:33,291
No, I haven't seen Lawless
since he walked out

146
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,791
of the venue last night.

147
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:35,875
Is something wrong?

148
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:38,666
[LICHT]
My body feels strange. Heavy.

149
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:43,916
It's a struggle just to walk.

150
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,833
Is this what that stupid
hedgehog was talking about?

151
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:51,083
You'll die if we stay
separated for 24 hours,

152
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:53,291
my angel of music,
so always keep me close!

153
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:55,583
[LICHT]
Why don't you shut up and die?

154
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:58,625
I'm gonna murder him
just as soon as I find him.

155
00:07:58,708 --> 00:08:01,333
[HIGAN]
The man you search for...

156
00:08:01,416 --> 00:08:05,250
...is so far beyond your reach,
it cannot be helped.

157
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:06,375
Uh, let's see...

158
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:08,375
You are the one
I'm looking for, right?

159
00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:09,666
Licht, something?

160
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:13,666
[LICHT]
What the hell? Who are you?

161
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,625
[HIGAN]
Your little pet made a mistake.

162
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:18,458
He put Tsubaki
in a terrible mood.

163
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:20,750
And as a result... [chuckles]

164
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,166
...he sent me.

165
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:24,708
I'm the old man who's now
in charge of dragging you

166
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:26,166
through total hell.

167
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:27,625
My dear pianist,

168
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:30,916
your wings will be torn from
you, no fault of your own.

169
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:36,458
[LICHT] When I was a child,
I had many dreams.

170
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:40,125
I wanted people everywhere to
listen to me play the piano.

171
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:43,541
I wanted to fly and
to talk to animals.

172
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:46,458
[animal crying]

173
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:48,541
What's your problem?

174
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:50,625
Sounds like you want something.

175
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:52,791
Almost like you understand
what I'm saying.

176
00:08:57,791 --> 00:08:59,000
Do you like music?

177
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:03,208
[LICHT] All those dreams
pretty much came true.

178
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:05,625
But now I have
a different dream.

179
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:08,583
And anything a man can
imagine is something

180
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:10,375
a man can make a reality.

181
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:12,916
White, white, black...

182
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,166
[LICHT]
Imagination is a weapon.

183
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,375
In fact,

184
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:18,708
it's the most powerful
thing in the world.

185
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:22,458
[LICHT]
White, black, white, black...

186
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:26,250
And red.

187
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:30,541
[HIGAN] Why go through
all this trouble, hmm?

188
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:32,125
You could give this
old man a break

189
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:35,541
and come quietly instead
of resisting the inevitable.

190
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:37,000
[LICHT]
You're outta your mind.

191
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:38,625
Tell me who you are!

192
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:41,083
Sure, kid, I'm... Hm?

193
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:42,125
Huh...

194
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:43,750
Where'd my lighter go?

195
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,333
Crap, don't tell
me I dropped it.

196
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:47,291
Hey, Licht, you don't
have a light, do you?

197
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:49,583
[LICHT]
I'd rather give you my foot!

198
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:53,375
Wow, youngsters nowadays
are so short-tempered.

199
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:55,125
It can't be helped.

200
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:57,416
Well, then. Back to it.

201
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,541
I guess I'll have to
hurt you some more.

202
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:05,625
[LICHT]
What is the hell is this?

203
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:08,833
The old man's got
some kind of fire power?

204
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:10,250
Hey, listen up, kid.

205
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:12,125
There's no way you
can win against me

206
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:13,833
if you're fighting alone.

207
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:15,166
Not without a shadow.

208
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,875
A shadow is necessary if
you want to see the light.

209
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:20,083
Otherwise, how do you
know it's there?

210
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:22,333
What? You're talking nonsense.

211
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:24,416
[HIGAN] Okay, then,
think of it this way.

212
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,208
Right now, your
shadow is beneath

213
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:28,958
Tsubaki's wooden
sandals, defeated.

214
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:30,958
I think Tsubaki
sent me a picture.

215
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:31,833
My phone...

216
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:34,208
Crap, did I drop that, too? Aww!

217
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,958
I don't give a damn about
that good-for-nothing hedgehog.

218
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:41,541
But still... I refuse
to allow you to beat me!

219
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:45,208
I can imagine myself winning,
so I'll make it happen.

220
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:47,083
[HIGAN]
Such a strong spirit.

221
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:48,916
How very unfortunate.

222
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Well, if you choose to resist,
I suppose it can't be helped.

223
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:55,333
Let's dance, little musician.

224
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:01,250
What is that?! A pillar of fire?

225
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:03,416
[MAHIRU]
Somebody's fighting over there.

226
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,791
Kuro! Let's go!

227
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:06,875
[KURO] Maybe we should
think about this first.

228
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:08,333
[MAHIRU]
But Licht could be in trouble.

229
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:09,750
Shouldn't we get
that spoiled brat

230
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:11,416
and the hot springs
giant to go with us

231
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,666
so we have some backup?

232
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:15,000
There's no time!
Licht could be dead by then!

233
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:15,875
[KURO]
But alone--

234
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:17,500
You're just being lazy again!

235
00:11:17,583 --> 00:11:20,458
No, that's not it,
I promise. You see, it's just--

236
00:11:20,541 --> 00:11:21,625
[MAHIRU]
We're fine!

237
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:23,166
As long as you're
with me, we can do this!

238
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,750
But we have to hurry!

239
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:26,125
Let's go, Kuro!

240
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,208
Put him down! Right now!

241
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:40,666
Wait, I know you.
You're Sloth's Eve, right?

242
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,375
I said get your
hands off him!

243
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:44,583
Now, now, there's no
reason to get worked up.

244
00:11:44,666 --> 00:11:47,375
Just look at him, he's enjoying
this little dance of ours.

245
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:48,416
[LICHT]
I'll kill you.

246
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,000
Who are you?
Lemme guess.

247
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:52,000
One of Tsubaki's subclasses?

248
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:55,250
You can call me Higan.

249
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:58,250
And yes, I'm one of
Tsubaki's charming friends.

250
00:11:58,333 --> 00:12:00,125
Higan?

251
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:02,250
--Kuro! It's time to fight!
--Really?

252
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:06,041
This is so troublesome.

253
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:17,875
Ma... hiru...

254
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:19,791
Kuro! What's going on?

255
00:12:27,541 --> 00:12:29,666
[MAHIRU]
What the...? Kuro?

256
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:38,666
What happened?

257
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,583
Are you...?

258
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:43,875
Hey, Kuro? Are you in there?

259
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:47,166
The Servamp of Sloth
turned into a little ball?

260
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:48,875
Interesting.

261
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:49,916
Weapon!

262
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:01,208
[LICHT]
I'm the one you're fighting.

263
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:03,250
So face me, old man.

264
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:14,625
[HIGAN] Your creation
skills are amazing.

265
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:17,125
And here I didn't take you
for the type who gets stronger

266
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:19,208
when protecting others.

267
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:22,541
Such an angry gaze.
It makes me want to draw.

268
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:25,625
Thanks a lot, kid.
You've inspired this old man.

269
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:38,125
[MAHIRU]
My body won't move.

270
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:39,833
I want to help,

271
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:42,166
but I'm just sitting here
and letting Licht protect me.

272
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,416
Why can't I fight?

273
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:49,958
I feel like I can hear
Licht speaking to me.

274
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:52,875
His words breaking through
the music and flames.

275
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:55,875
[LICHT] "Why the hell
did you come here?"

276
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:57,333
[MAHIRU]
It's no use!

277
00:13:57,416 --> 00:13:59,208
I'm not strong enough!

278
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:00,583
Kuro's gone.

279
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:02,083
I don't have a weapon.

280
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:03,541
I can't do anything!

281
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:11,666
[LICHT] It's not about wanting
to do something that you can do.

282
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,583
It's about what you want to do.

283
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:19,208
[LICHT] It's not about
wanting to become someone.

284
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:21,666
It's about who
you want to become.

285
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,583
[HIGAN sighs]
How tiring.

286
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:34,791
You're really strong, kid.

287
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:37,541
[MAHIRU] I have to move--
to do something!

288
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:39,625
[HIGAN] But all's well
that ends well, I suppose,

289
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:41,291
and my objective's been met.

290
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:43,625
It just can't be helped.

291
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:44,875
[MAHIRU]
Move!

292
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:47,583
[MAHIRU] Stop!
You put him down right now!

293
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:51,208
It's fine to be brave,
but it's not always smart.

294
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:53,125
Tell your friends
that I said hello.

295
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:58,750
[MAHIRU] No way...
What did you do to me?

296
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:00,625
Who are you?

297
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:04,250
You wanna know who I am?
I am a simple artist.

298
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:05,333
[MAHIRU grunts]

299
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:12,208
[HIGAN] The man who draws
what Tsubaki wants to see.

300
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:16,125
[MISONO]
This is impossible.

301
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:20,500
You're saying this tiny black
ball is the Servamp of Sloth?

302
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:22,458
[LILLY]
It's true. I feel his presence.

303
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:24,166
[HUGH]
So do I.

304
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:27,875
[MAHIRU] That man took
Licht and I couldn't stop him.

305
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:29,416
Couldn't do anything.

306
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:33,000
Kuro was right after all.

307
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:35,958
I should have waited
for the rest of you guys.

308
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:37,000
Crap!

309
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:42,458
[MISONO] Don't beat yourself up;
we may still have a chance.

310
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:43,916
Look what I found.

311
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,375
I came across it
on our way here.

312
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:48,000
A cellphone?

313
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:50,958
Wait... Is that a Berukia charm?

314
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:53,291
Do you think this belongs to
one of Tsubaki's subclasses?

315
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:54,791
I do.

316
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:57,041
And that gives us a direct line
of communication with him.

317
00:15:57,125 --> 00:15:58,291
We don't have to
sit around waiting

318
00:15:58,375 --> 00:15:59,500
for his next move anymore.

319
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:02,041
[BERUKIA (RINGTONE)]
Someone's calling you!

320
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:03,166
[BERUKIA (RINGTONE) laughing]

321
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:05,000
Jackpot. We're in luck.

322
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:08,333
Yeah, but... What's with
this ringtone and wallpaper?

323
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:10,333
[TSUBAKI]
Ah, wonderful, hello.

324
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:13,000
Did you happen upon this phone?
What a relief.

325
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:15,583
I'm a family member of
the person who dropped it.

326
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:17,208
Thanks for picking it up.

327
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:18,250
[MAHIRU]
Tsubaki!

328
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:19,708
[TSUBAKI]
Higan.

329
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:22,083
Don't worry, it looks like
someone found it after all.

330
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:23,833
[HIGAN]
Oh, thank goodness.

331
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:25,541
[TSUBAKI] Well, aren't
you going to thank them?

332
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:27,125
[HIGAN]
I mean, I guess I should.

333
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:29,750
Want it back? Then how
about we set up a trade?

334
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:33,791
We want the Servamp.
And Eve too, you bastards!

335
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:41,875
[TSUBAKI laughing]

336
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:44,166
Not interesting at all.

337
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:46,750
I'm speaking to the Eve
of Lust, that right?

338
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:48,500
Don't you think you're
asking a bit much?

339
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:50,458
I mean, it is just a phone.

340
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:51,875
That's not all.

341
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:54,125
We also have one of your
subclasses in our possession.

342
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:56,000
I'd call that a
pretty good deal.

343
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:57,083
And another thing...

344
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:59,041
We want Greed and Licht
back unharmed.

345
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:00,041
[MAHIRU]
Misono!

346
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:01,750
You're the one
who said he cared.

347
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:04,375
We'll see if he really does
want his subclasses safe.

348
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:06,500
It's the only card
we have to play.

349
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:09,083
[TSUBAKI] Don't you have
anything interesting to say?

350
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:14,250
We'll plan the tradeoff
and call you back

351
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:15,583
from this phone later.

352
00:17:15,666 --> 00:17:16,791
Interesting enough for you?

353
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:18,125
[TSUBAKI]
I see.

354
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:20,833
All right, fine, we won't
hurt them anymore.

355
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:23,625
But I think we'll still keep
them separated far apart

356
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:25,416
from each other.

357
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,958
[TSUBAKI]
Well, I'm going to sleep now,

358
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:29,791
so be a dear and don't call me
again until late afternoon,

359
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:30,833
all right?

360
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:32,750
Oh, one more thing.

361
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:35,208
Higan says the charm
on his phone is handmade,

362
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:37,750
so make sure you're careful
and don't break it.

363
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:40,000
[MISONO]
That's what you care about?!

364
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:41,000
It's safe.

365
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:42,416
Jeez, what a relief.

366
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,416
Higan!

367
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,833
Your mistake
deserves punishment!

368
00:17:44,916 --> 00:17:46,166
Even death!

369
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:48,250
I'll never understand why
you're his number two.

370
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:49,750
If anyone, it should be me!

371
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:51,083
Ah. So you're back.

372
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:53,041
I thought I smelled
old man in here.

373
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:55,125
Hey. I can't help
the way I smell.

374
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:56,750
Well, now...

375
00:17:56,833 --> 00:17:59,500
It seems our plans
have been rewritten.

376
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:02,500
What to do? What to do?

377
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:03,541
[LAWLESS]
Ouch.

378
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:05,583
And where am I?

379
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:07,666
What time it is it?

380
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:10,166
How long has it been?

381
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:13,208
I wonder if the angel died.

382
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:15,375
Life's but a walking shadow.

383
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:18,041
A poor player...

384
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:23,250
...that struts and frets
his hour upon the stage.

385
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:27,416
And then is heard no more.

386
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:30,958
No matter how much they
struggle in the light,

387
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:33,416
they all die without meaning.

388
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:38,166
Licht's piano
skills are amazing,

389
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,708
but pointless.

390
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:41,000
No matter who you are,

391
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:44,500
it's impossible to become
anything that lasts.

392
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:47,875
Human life is so meaningless.

393
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:52,333
[MISONO] They can't stay
separated very long.

394
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:54,291
So we have to act quickly.

395
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:55,875
If the Servamp
of Greed was taken

396
00:18:55,958 --> 00:18:58,916
around midnight last night,
and they haven't been reunited,

397
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,625
then we don't have
much time to plan.

398
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:02,875
Licht's life is
in grave danger.

399
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:04,708
[MAHIRU]
You mean he could really die?

400
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:06,583
At midnight tonight?

401
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:07,791
What will you do?

402
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:09,208
Should we go invade immediately?

403
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:10,833
Are you completely clueless?

404
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:12,208
Where would we even invade?

405
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:13,333
[MAHIRU]
Then what?

406
00:19:13,416 --> 00:19:14,708
[MISONO]
Shirota.

407
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:18,041
You can't be involved
in this rescue mission.

408
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:19,750
You don't know what
happened to your Servamp,

409
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:23,166
and you have no weapon. Correct?

410
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:25,750
We don't have time to look
into what happened to Sloth.

411
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:28,958
Lilly and I will do what we can
with Tetsu and Hugh by our side.

412
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:32,791
We only have 16 hours,

413
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:34,833
but we'll do our best
to save those two.

414
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:38,250
Let's get a plan together.

415
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:50,791
[MAHIRU] I can't believe I'm
useless at a time like this.

416
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:52,458
What am I doing?

417
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:54,375
I feel like I'm
running in circles.

418
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:57,208
[MAHIRU]
Kuro!

419
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:02,708
[MAHIRU] I thought that
by going to the park,

420
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:04,750
I'd be able to save Licht.

421
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:07,958
I thought I had enough
power on my own.

422
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:11,958
I thought I could
be Kuro's partner.

423
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:14,166
But all I really did was
expect him to fight for me

424
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:16,125
and take care of everything.

425
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:18,291
Even though he said
it was a pain.

426
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:20,208
I'm so stupid.

427
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:22,250
I haven't learned
anything at all!

428
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:24,875
Even after everything
that's happened to me!

429
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:25,916
Dammit!

430
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:29,500
I wanted to get stronger.

431
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:31,750
To protect people.

432
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:34,333
C'mon, Kuro.
What happened to you?

433
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:37,625
Where are you?
You dumb cat.

434
00:20:37,708 --> 00:20:38,666
Kuro...

435
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:42,208
You know,
I wanted to be an adult

436
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:45,333
so I could have the ability
to face problems head on.

437
00:20:45,416 --> 00:20:49,250
But I didn't face you
head on at all.

438
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:51,708
I pretended it didn't matter
what you were feeling.

439
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:55,458
I pretended to be kind,
but ignored you.

440
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:57,583
Thanks to you, I was able
to do a lot of things

441
00:20:57,666 --> 00:20:59,833
I never would have
been able to alone.

442
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:03,291
But when it was my turn to help
you out when you needed it,

443
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:04,750
I totally failed.

444
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:09,958
[crying] I'm sorry!

445
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:12,250
Kuro, I'm sorry!

446
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:13,333
[MAHIRU crying]

447
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:14,833
[KURO]
I can't watch this.

448
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:15,916
[MAHIRU gasps]

449
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:22,958
Kuro?!

450
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:25,458
[KURO] Why are you making
so much noise out there?

451
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:26,916
[MAHIRU]
Huh? What happened to you?

452
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,750
I actually have no idea.

453
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:30,208
I can't get out, though.

454
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:33,041
Well, at least you're alive.

455
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,458
I was afraid I'd never
hear your voice again.

456
00:21:36,541 --> 00:21:38,291
[KURO] Honestly,
I kinda like it in here.

457
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:39,833
[MAHIRU]
You can't stay in the ball!

458
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:43,000
There's gotta be a way out.

459
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:47,916
Because... I want to talk
to you man-to-man, Kuro.

460
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,375
[MAHIRU]
That's right. Think.

461
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:52,208
What do I want to become?

462
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:53,625
How will I do it?

463
00:21:53,708 --> 00:21:55,791
I'll find a way to
get you back to normal.

464
00:21:55,875 --> 00:21:59,083
Thinking simply. It has
to be me. I'm your Eve.

465
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:01,541
[KURO]
This is turning into a drag.

466
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:05,000
I'm having a perfectly nice time
rolling around in this thing.

467
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:07,666
The outside world
is too much of a pain.

468
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:10,250
Maybe this is a good thing.
I don't have to face it now.

469
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:12,000
[MAHIRU]
You're not staying in the ball!

470
00:23:42,333 --> 00:23:43,791
[SHAMROCK] I must know!
Will our young master

471
00:23:43,875 --> 00:23:45,083
show up again next time?

472
00:23:45,166 --> 00:23:46,875
[HIGAN] It can't be
helped if he doesn't.
