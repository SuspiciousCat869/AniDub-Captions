1
00:00:10,416 --> 00:00:12,083
[MALE GUEST 9A]
Hey. What's going on?

2
00:00:12,166 --> 00:00:13,208
[MALE GUEST 9B]
A blackout?

3
00:00:15,166 --> 00:00:17,208
[MISONO] Dammit!
You're smarter than I thought.

4
00:00:17,291 --> 00:00:19,208
And to think you saw
past my elevator shoes.

5
00:00:19,291 --> 00:00:21,583
[SAKUYA]
That disguise sucks!

6
00:00:21,666 --> 00:00:22,916
[MISONO]
This is bad.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,166
What if Greed and his Eve
have already been moved?

8
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:27,208
No, they're still using
this hotel as their base.

9
00:00:27,291 --> 00:00:28,708
They didn't expect us.

10
00:00:28,791 --> 00:00:30,625
Sendagaya! I'm going down.

11
00:00:30,708 --> 00:00:32,750
You take the stairs up.

12
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:34,416
Leave it to me!

13
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:35,666
[MISONO]
All right.

14
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:39,125
So it's up to Lilly
and me to stop this guy.

15
00:00:39,208 --> 00:00:40,666
[laughing]

16
00:02:15,041 --> 00:02:16,333
Here I am.


17
00:02:16,416 --> 00:02:17,625
I wonder which one
of their group

18
00:02:17,708 --> 00:02:19,333
they'll send to
say hello to me.

19
00:02:23,541 --> 00:02:24,500
[TSUBAKI]
Huh...?

20
00:02:27,041 --> 00:02:28,333
Look, I like a
good laugh as much

21
00:02:28,416 --> 00:02:30,791
as the next vampire,
but this is a bit much.

22
00:02:30,875 --> 00:02:32,541
[GILL] So you're the
one called Tsubaki!

23
00:02:32,625 --> 00:02:34,083
What a harsh voice!

24
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:36,666
I didn't expect a cute whale
like you to sound so manly.

25
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,583
[GILL] I'm told that you've
taken our Servamp

26
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:40,875
and his Eve as your prisoners.

27
00:02:40,958 --> 00:02:42,291
Oh, I see.

28
00:02:42,375 --> 00:02:45,458
You're subclasses of Greed
here to save your master.

29
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:46,833
[GILL]
He may be a brat,

30
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:48,583
but he's still our boss.

31
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:50,875
If anyone is going to
punish that little monster,

32
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:52,500
we're the ones who
should get to do it.

33
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:54,041
He isn't yours to hurt.

34
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:55,833
We'll be taking him back now.

35
00:02:55,916 --> 00:02:57,291
[TSUBAKI laughs]

36
00:02:57,375 --> 00:02:59,375
Well, I was thinking
of settling this situation

37
00:02:59,458 --> 00:03:02,583
by handing over the keys to
the rooms they're being held in.

38
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:04,083
[GILL]
The keys?

39
00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:06,208
[TSUBAKI] Listen, it's really
hard to take you seriously

40
00:03:06,291 --> 00:03:08,375
when you look so ridiculous.

41
00:03:08,458 --> 00:03:10,458
I'm living up to
my end of the bargain.

42
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:12,375
Now where is my subclass?

43
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:14,916
[GILL]
He's here. But he's hidden.

44
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,041
You'll find him inside one
of these mascot costumes.

45
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:19,208
Inside one?

46
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:20,291
[GILL grunts]

47
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,791
[TSUBAKI]
What a clever ruse.

48
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:27,416
If I attack any
of you at random,

49
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,583
I risk hurting my own subclass.

50
00:03:29,666 --> 00:03:32,791
Hmm, I wonder what I should do.

51
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:35,416
This is turning into
quite an annoying trade.

52
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:37,708
Hello...?

53
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,875
Someone's showing off.

54
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:42,041
Oh, I see.

55
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:44,083
This must be Alicein's
private property.

56
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:47,791
Honestly, I thought this
trap would be more elaborate.

57
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:49,833
Either you didn't have
enough time to plan,

58
00:03:49,916 --> 00:03:52,416
or the person in charge
was just very unimaginative.

59
00:03:54,916 --> 00:03:56,208
[TSUBAKI]
Not to worry.

60
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:58,500
As long as there's a
chance my subclass is here,

61
00:03:58,583 --> 00:03:59,875
I'll play along.

62
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:01,958
I'm not skipping out on the fun.

63
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:03,500
But I must warn you
that I'm the type

64
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:05,958
who'll do anything
to win the game.

65
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:08,125
Are you certain
you're ready for this?

66
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:11,833
[TSUBAKI] Hmm...
The mascot costumes are thick,

67
00:04:11,916 --> 00:04:14,541
so I can't tell if there's
one person inside or two.

68
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,666
[TSUBAKI] Playing hide-and-seek
with whales in the forest...

69
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:21,625
I actually kind of admire
how absurd this setup is.

70
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:29,041
[laughing maniacally]

71
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:30,083
Ah!

72
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:33,166
Not interesting at all.

73
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,208
Shall we continue?

74
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:37,666
It's always so sad if
one of the poor children

75
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:41,458
isn't found during a game
of hide-and-seek, isn't it?

76
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:43,166
So...

77
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,666
...let's play the game.

78
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:52,458
[MISONO]
Bottom floor.

79
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:57,166
Gill and the others can only
distract Tsubaki for so long.

80
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,958
We have to save Greed
and his Eve quickly.

81
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:02,000
[HUGH] According to the
information we've gathered,

82
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:04,250
it seems Tsubaki has
five main subclasses

83
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:06,041
who are all highly
skilled in battle.

84
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:08,083
[MISONO] The strongest
among them is named Higan.

85
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:11,500
He's the one who kidnapped
Licht in front of Mahiru.

86
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:13,125
Logically speaking,
if the Greed pair

87
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:15,500
is separated beyond
their distance limit,

88
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:17,250
then our enemy is most
likely guarding them

89
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:18,916
in two different teams.

90
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,041
Higan can probably
handle one hostage

91
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:23,750
while the other
four work together.

92
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:26,208
Heh. As long as we take
Tsubaki out of the picture,

93
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:29,125
Tetsu and I can easily
handle any subclasses.

94
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:30,333
So you say.

95
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:33,250
Hopefully we won't
have to find out.

96
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,541
[MISONO] In order to get
Greed and Licht back safely,

97
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:38,541
we'll have to stop any
subclasses we come across.

98
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:42,250
But my Lilly isn't
well suited for combat.

99
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:45,125
How many of Tsubaki's
subclasses are down here?

100
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:46,666
Who are we facing?

101
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:50,041
[MISONO]
Huh? No one?

102
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:51,166
What's going on?

103
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,583
[chainsaw revving]

104
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:55,083
[SAKUYA]
There a problem?

105
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:57,958
You look like you were
expecting someone, huh?

106
00:05:58,041 --> 00:06:00,125
[LILLY]
Stand back, I'll handle this.

107
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:01,541
Something's off.

108
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:03,083
We're alone here.

109
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:05,833
I don't sense anyone else.

110
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:08,250
[MISONO]
What sort of trick is this?

111
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:11,416
[SAKUYA] Guess you made
a few miscalculations.

112
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,083
I bet you expected us
to separate the hostages

113
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:16,083
beyond their distance limit.

114
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:17,875
And that the subclasses
would be split up

115
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:20,791
into two teams to protect
the top and bottom floors.

116
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:22,875
Sound about right?

117
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:25,458
You really don't
understand Tsubaki at all.

118
00:06:25,541 --> 00:06:28,833
He's not the kind of person who
wants to be on the defensive.

119
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:31,416
You could also say
he lacks subtlety.

120
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,250
He'd rather aim big.

121
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:36,375
[TSUBAKI] I think we'll still
keep them separated far apart

122
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:37,375
from each other.

123
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:38,583
[MISONO]
Crap.

124
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:40,166
He's been playing us
from the very beginning.

125
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:42,750
[SAKUYA] You thought you
had the upper hand here.

126
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:45,708
But, you see, our goal
was never to destroy Greed.

127
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:48,666
It was to use him as
bait to get to Pride.

128
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,125
So we can crush him.

129
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:52,458
[MISONO]
They tricked us.

130
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:55,291
Lawless and Licht must
both be on the top floor.

131
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:58,291
Dammit, I can't believe
I fell for this.

132
00:06:58,375 --> 00:07:01,208
[BERUKIA] Huh? This guy's
seriously only 14?

133
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:03,791
[HIGAN chuckles] No one's more
surprised than this old man.

134
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:04,833
[SHAMROCK]
Higan!

135
00:07:04,916 --> 00:07:06,291
Will you please
stop fooling around?

136
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:07,875
Yeah, all right.

137
00:07:07,958 --> 00:07:09,583
I don't really wanna
fight against a kid,

138
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:11,833
but then I guess
it can't be helped.

139
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:13,708
So they're definitely
hiding Greed and his Eve

140
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:15,083
back there, right, Hugh?

141
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:18,291
Yes. This is quite the blockade.

142
00:07:18,375 --> 00:07:20,333
Don't worry your
head about this, Tetsu.

143
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,333
[HUGH]
Pride's here!

144
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:26,916
And I'm gonna handle
these guys all by myself.

145
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
[LILLY]
Misono!

146
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:33,875
[MISONO] We have to
defeat him quickly

147
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:35,458
and get up to the top floor.

148
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:36,541
But how?

149
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:38,583
Winning's the easy part.

150
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:39,833
Listen, brother.

151
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:41,750
All you have to do is
make sure you're crueler

152
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:43,541
than your opponent is.

153
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:44,875
[MISONO]
I can't hold back.

154
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:47,375
I have to provoke my enemy
and catch him off guard.

155
00:07:47,458 --> 00:07:49,083
Sakuya Watanuki.

156
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:51,916
Tell me something--
who are you right now?

157
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,166
I don't see the trusting
friend Shirota promised

158
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:55,541
to save anywhere.

159
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:57,916
[SAKUYA yelling]

160
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,791
[SAKUYA]
Shut up!

161
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:00,333
Don't say another word!

162
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:02,875
Mahiru doesn't understand!

163
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:04,916
He doesn't see the
point of this war.

164
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,625
The point?

165
00:08:06,708 --> 00:08:09,291
[SAKUYA]
Tsubaki has very specific goals.

166
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:10,750
He's been searching for so long,

167
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:13,166
but he still doesn't
know what the key is.

168
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:16,833
It might be as
simple as revenge.

169
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:19,291
Or it could be
something more terrifying.

170
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:21,583
So then this isn't
about vampires.

171
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:23,541
Guess they were only
a means to an end.

172
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:26,750
[SAKUYA] The whole war is about
finding some kind of key.

173
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:30,125
That's why he's doing everything
in such a roundabout way.

174
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:32,208
[MISONO]
What is he looking for?

175
00:08:32,291 --> 00:08:33,375
[SAKUYA]
It's...

176
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:45,208
[LICHT grunts]

177
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:46,416
Where am I?

178
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:52,708
No doubt this is that
rotten hedgehog's fault.

179
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:53,833
I'll kill him.

180
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:56,875
[LAWLESS]
Man. This is a bad sign.

181
00:08:56,958 --> 00:08:58,416
I'm hallucinating.

182
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:02,041
It's like I can hear my
little angel's voice in here.

183
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:04,166
I wonder if that means
he's about to die.

184
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:07,125
I mean, who knows how long
we've been separated for.

185
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:08,833
Of course.

186
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:10,125
I shouldn't be surprised!

187
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:12,250
Even my gloomy musician
is going to die!

188
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:14,166
He'll never become
anything at all!

189
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:15,500
He's so arrogant!

190
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:17,208
"Because I'm an angel," he says.

191
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:19,000
Don't make me laugh!

192
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:20,875
Actually, it's not
funny at all, is it?

193
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:22,750
[LICHT]
Shut up, you stupid animal.

194
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,500
I am not going to die here.

195
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:29,958
Because I am an angel,
you got that?

196
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:31,833
[LAWLESS]
I hate hearing voices.

197
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:33,958
Y'know, it's a real pain that
our minds are connected

198
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:35,625
by our contract.

199
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:38,041
The last thing I need is
your delusional death throes.

200
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:40,250
[LICHT] It's not like I want
to hear your idiotic voice

201
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:41,875
in my thoughts, either.

202
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:45,416
Hold on. Are you really there,
or am I totally insane?

203
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,791
[LICHT] Could you be
any more annoying?

204
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:49,291
I don't believe it.

205
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:51,250
So you're actually next door?

206
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:53,958
They must have caught you
after me, didn't they, Licht?

207
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:54,958
So lame.

208
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:56,125
[LICHT]
Shut up before I kill you.

209
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:57,250
[LAWLESS]
Yeah. Whatever.

210
00:09:58,541 --> 00:09:59,916
[LAWLESS]
Say, Licht...

211
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,583
They hurt you, didn't they?

212
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:04,250
It's weird...

213
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:06,250
My wounds won't heal at all.

214
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:08,875
So Licht, what happens
if this is how you die?

215
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:10,750
I mean, it's true
you're a great pianist,

216
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:12,625
but there are plenty
other musicians out there

217
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:13,958
in the world.

218
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:15,583
No matter how
unique a person is,

219
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:17,333
their life doesn't
really matter.

220
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:19,791
[LICHT]
I'm the exception, dumbass.

221
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:22,208
No. There's no such thing.

222
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:23,875
There's nothing special
about you, Licht!

223
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:26,541
The audience will applaud and
cry no matter who's playing.

224
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:29,125
You're just another musician
to them, that's all.

225
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:30,875
Something about us is different.

226
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:32,500
Oh, yeah? What's that?

227
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:33,458
It's me.

228
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:34,958
What are you talking about?

229
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:42,041
[LICHT] What are you
running away from, Lawless?

230
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:44,958
You stupid angel!
You don't get it at all, do you?

231
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:47,166
You should know better than
to have hopes and dreams.

232
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:48,916
They're all so meaningless.

233
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,500
Shut your mouth!

234
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:52,666
You're the idiot with
no real motivation!

235
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:53,958
You're gonna die!

236
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:55,750
And your whole life will
have been for nothing!

237
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:57,291
You won't leave a mark
on this world!

238
00:10:57,375 --> 00:10:59,166
No, I'll live! Just you watch!

239
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:00,708
Will you stop talking?!

240
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:02,208
No human life has any worth,

241
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:04,000
and there's nothing you
can do to change that.

242
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:04,958
Sorry, it's true.

243
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:06,291
Talk and talk and talk,

244
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:08,083
but you don't really
believe what you say at all.

245
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:09,416
Get over here!

246
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,541
[LAWLESS]
You really are stupid, Licht.

247
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:13,333
Don't you think if I had
the power to get out of here,

248
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:14,541
I would?

249
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:16,708
You think I like sitting
chained up...

250
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:26,333
[LICHT] What, nothing to say
when we're face to face?

251
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:27,791
Pull yourself together.

252
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:38,000
[MAHIRU]
Where am I?

253
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:41,291
A desert? Hello?

254
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:45,250
[MAHIRU]
Hey, I know you.

255
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:46,458
Hello.

256
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:49,041
Kuro doesn't want to
see you at the moment.

257
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,250
You're lying!

258
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:53,416
[bell jingling]

259
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:56,000
[MAHIRU]
I hear it.

260
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:57,750
[KURO] Look at the map.
There's nothing ahead!

261
00:11:57,833 --> 00:12:01,125
Good morning! Good evening!
Good morning!

262
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:02,791
[MAHIRU yells]

263
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:06,875
[bell jingling]

264
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:10,083
[MAHIRU]
Down here?

265
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:12,750
But how do I
get below a desert?

266
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:16,166
[MAHIRU] I can't lose
sight of why I'm here.

267
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:19,625
I have to find Kuro so I can
make things right with him.

268
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:21,041
Face to face.

269
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:24,333
Honestly. We'll fix this.

270
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:27,041
[KRANTZ] You see, it isn't
talent that accomplishes things.

271
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:29,208
It's imagination and effort.

272
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:32,208
[LICHT] It's not about wanting
to do something that you can do.

273
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:34,083
It's about what you want to do.

274
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:37,625
[MAHIRU]
This is what I want.

275
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:39,833
I just have to
set my mind to it.

276
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:41,000
Let's see...

277
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:49,541
[MAHIRU]
Stairs... going underwater?

278
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:09,083
Well. Now you've found him.

279
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:14,708
[MAHIRU]
Kuro?

280
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:16,916
[LAWLESS] Ugh, this whole
thing is insufferable.

281
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,916
Oh, don't get so riled up.

282
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,083
A majority vote is the fairest
way to make this big decision.

283
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:26,083
So are we going to kill the
person that C3 wants us to,

284
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:27,291
or not?

285
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:29,250
We don't have to take
orders from this C3.

286
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:32,250
Why don't we just rip
the letter up and eat it?

287
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:35,333
[JEJE] That's your
solution to every problem.

288
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:37,208
Why are we even
having this conversation?

289
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:39,916
It's crazy to think we might
kill someone for those bastards.

290
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,875
But we all know how
dangerous this person is.

291
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:45,375
Maybe it would be better
if he were gone.

292
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:46,958
Look, I understand
the logic here,

293
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:49,541
but something doesn't feel
right about all of this.

294
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:54,791
It's insane to think
we'd kill him just because

295
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:56,583
some organization told us to.

296
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:59,041
After all, he is the person
who created we Servamps

297
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:00,458
in the first place.

298
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:04,416
[MAHIRU]
The person who created Servamps?

299
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,791
Are Kuro and the others
going to kill him?

300
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:08,125
That's right.

301
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:11,666
He created seven monsters
like us all by himself.

302
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,375
He's powerful.

303
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:16,000
The letter says
that C3 found him.

304
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:18,333
Or at least someone in
Japan fitting his genius

305
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:19,541
and description.

306
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,666
Now, which one of us
saw him most recently?

307
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:24,166
I believe it might
have been me.

308
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:26,875
Though, that was at least
a hundred years ago.

309
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:29,250
[HUGH] If it's true
and he is still alive,

310
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:31,291
then he's no longer human.

311
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:32,708
Not surprising.

312
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:35,250
No human could have the
amount of power that man has.

313
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:36,666
Huh?

314
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,541
You're saying it takes a
monster to make a monster, eh?

315
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:41,041
[JEJE] What if he made
more creatures like us?

316
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:42,125
What then?

317
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:44,125
The world would
look like a hellscape

318
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:45,625
with monsters everywhere.

319
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:47,125
[GLUTTONY]
Listen, you mumbling maniac!

320
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:49,000
He hasn't actually
done anything yet!

321
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:50,708
We have no reason to kill him.

322
00:14:50,791 --> 00:14:53,583
[JEJE] But we could do it
now, before it's too late.

323
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:55,583
How about you, Sleepy Ash?

324
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:56,875
What say you?

325
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:06,583
[KURO]
He must die.

326
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:09,583
[KURO]
I'll do it myself.

327
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:13,333
[LAWLESS] You really
think you can kill him?

328
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:15,583
[laughs sarcastically]

329
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:17,416
The human who created you?

330
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,375
You spend too much
time asleep, brother.

331
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:21,541
It's made you weak in the head.

332
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:23,291
He's like a parent to us.

333
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:25,041
He's practically one of us!

334
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:26,958
Our creator!

335
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:29,458
We have a duty
to protect that man!

336
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:31,125
Aren't we of all people the ones

337
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:33,208
who should be standing
by his side right now?

338
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:36,041
You're firstborn! Shouldn't
you try to keep him safe?

339
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:37,291
He's family!

340
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:39,541
Don't you dare use that
word to talk about us.

341
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:40,750
[GLUTTONY]
Hey!

342
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:42,041
[KURO]
What are we, really?

343
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:44,291
Can you even say
that we were born?

344
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:45,625
No, we were.

345
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:50,791
You know...

346
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:52,875
I never thought the
creation of vampires

347
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:54,583
was a good thing.

348
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:55,958
Not once.

349
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:58,083
What? No...

350
00:15:58,166 --> 00:15:59,625
You can't...

351
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:00,958
That man is...

352
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:02,166
He's still our...

353
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:08,541
Kuro, come back!

354
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:12,500
[MAHIRU]
Kuro!

355
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:18,958
[MAHIRU]
These... must be his memories.

356
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:21,083
I'm seeing his past.

357
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:22,791
He went alone to meet
with the one who created

358
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:24,291
all the Servamps.

359
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:28,916
[MAN 9A]
Ah. It's been a long time.

360
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:32,500
I'm glad to see you well...

361
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:34,125
...Sleepy Ash.

362
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:35,208
[KURO]
Wow.

363
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:38,875
I can't believe he's
really still alive.

364
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:41,375
[KURO]
Think about it.

365
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:43,750
[KURO]
No, don't think.

366
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:45,041
[MAHIRU]
I can't hear.

367
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:46,458
What are they saying?

368
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:49,041
Kuro looks unsure.

369
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:50,166
But he's doing it anyway.

370
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:51,625
[KURO]
But I have to kill him.

371
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,166
[MAHIRU]
Kuro! Your eyes!

372
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:58,291
[MAHIRU yells]

373
00:16:58,375 --> 00:17:00,583
[KURO]
Don't look! Don't look!

374
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:02,500
I don't want to disappoint you.

375
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:04,666
I want to become
a hero, too, Mahiru.

376
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,333
Kuro, stop it, please!

377
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:10,375
You must know that
this was the only way.

378
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:13,833
We did what we had to;
there's nothing to regret.

379
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:16,958
[JEJE] He's right; we just
played the cards we were dealt.

380
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:18,000
Don't look down.

381
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:19,958
We chose the best option.

382
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:21,583
Yes, I objected.

383
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:23,333
But I can still see
that his death

384
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:25,791
was the inevitable outcome.

385
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:27,333
I am not angry.

386
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:30,458
I have no right to be mad at
you, even though I disagreed.

387
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:37,833
[LAWLESS] Well, I'm not
gonna forgive what you did.

388
00:17:37,916 --> 00:17:40,375
I'll never forget this!

389
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:42,541
[MAHIRU] This is where Kuro's
uncertainty and regret

390
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:43,708
come from.

391
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:45,333
I didn't understand
the resolve I needed

392
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:47,625
to face his past alongside him.

393
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:49,125
He needs help.

394
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:52,416
Kuro! You idiot!

395
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,208
I won't run away!

396
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:55,541
I'm here!

397
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:57,750
Because I'm determined
to get you back to normal!

398
00:17:57,833 --> 00:17:59,708
Your past sins and
regrets don't matter;

399
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:01,708
only what you do now!

400
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:04,291
I didn't know the resolve I'd
need to face this kind of pain.

401
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:05,833
[MAHIRU yelling]

402
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:08,333
[KURO]
Hey, you.

403
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:11,250
What do you think is eternal
in this fleeting world?

404
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:13,083
All living beings die.

405
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:14,541
Things fall apart.

406
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:17,000
Feelings fade away.

407
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:19,250
There's only one true constant.

408
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:23,583
As long as you're human,
only one thing is eternal.

409
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:27,041
And that... is the sin of man.

410
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:32,208
[MAHIRU]
Where am I?

411
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:34,375
[KURO]
My goodness.

412
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:38,333
I'm honestly impressed you
made it this far in, Mahiru.

413
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:40,708
If you were smart,
then you'd leave him alone.

414
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:43,583
What are you? Really?

415
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:45,625
[KURO]
Hmm... hmm... hmm...

416
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,583
Well, if you're here,
why don't you pry open

417
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:49,125
one of Kuro's secrets?

418
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:51,875
You might learn a thing or two.

419
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:52,750
Hold on.

420
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:54,708
I can give you some tools.

421
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:58,291
You can break every one of
these tortured containers open.

422
00:18:58,375 --> 00:19:00,916
Find out Kuro's deepest fears.

423
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,916
Everything he regrets in life!

424
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
[MAHIRU]
I don't need to.

425
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:09,750
Kuro. You're inside, aren't you?

426
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:13,458
All I want is for
him to let me in.

427
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:15,500
I don't need a weapon.

428
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,875
I just need to knock.

429
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:18,708
[knocking]

430
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:21,458
It's me! Hey!

431
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:22,666
[KURO]
Who are you?

432
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:23,750
I'm...

433
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:27,416
[MAHIRU]
Me?

434
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:35,458
[MAHIRU]
Wait... Who am I again?

435
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:45,541
[MAHIRU]
It's me. Mahiru Shirota!

436
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:47,958
I came here so I could face you.

437
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:49,166
[KURO]
Mahiru.

438
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:58,458
[KURO]
I... No, but...

439
00:19:58,541 --> 00:20:01,333
Why did I do
something like that?

440
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:04,125
We don't need any more
monsters in the world.

441
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:07,333
No. I had a choice.

442
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:09,375
Should I have
discussed things first?

443
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,416
Could I have done
something like that?

444
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:14,875
[MAHIRU] All this time you
regretted what happened. Alone.

445
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:17,083
[KURO]
I was right. I'm not wrong.

446
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:21,500
We don't need any more
monsters in the world.

447
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:23,500
I had to stop him there.

448
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:24,916
I was right.

449
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,250
And if I hadn't done it,
someone else would have.

450
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:30,416
No. Is that true?

451
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,875
Was the only choice
really to kill him?

452
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:36,375
If I was wrong,
then why did I do it?

453
00:20:36,458 --> 00:20:38,333
Regret is so painful.

454
00:20:38,416 --> 00:20:40,083
It's tearing me apart.

455
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:42,958
I'd rather never do
or feel anything again.

456
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:44,833
I won't make
any more decisions.

457
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:46,750
I'll only do what
others tell me to do.

458
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:48,500
That's all.

459
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:49,916
Did I do the right thing?

460
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,208
Someone, please tell me.

461
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:55,833
Tell me that I wasn't
wrong to kill him!

462
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:58,875
[crying]

463
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:04,333
Maybe you were wrong, Kuro!

464
00:21:04,416 --> 00:21:06,083
But you already know that.

465
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:08,750
You're the only one who can
tell if you were wrong or right,

466
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:11,958
and I can hear you arguing
with yourself about it.

467
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:14,458
Listen to me! Kuro...

468
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:15,958
The reason you feel
this way is because

469
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:19,458
you're doubting your actions
all those years ago.

470
00:21:19,541 --> 00:21:21,875
It takes courage to
accept you were wrong.

471
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:24,083
Because it means you
don't trust yourself.

472
00:21:24,166 --> 00:21:25,583
But you can work through this.

473
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:27,041
You can move on!

474
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:28,083
[grunts]

475
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:31,083
If you regret it,

476
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:33,875
then you can't just sit here
moping around forever.

477
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:35,791
Kuro. Stand up.

478
00:21:35,875 --> 00:21:37,125
You and me.

479
00:21:37,208 --> 00:21:39,291
Let's face this together.

480
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:42,041
You're not alone. Got that?

481
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:48,291
You're such a pain.

482
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:49,625
I could just die.

483
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:56,041
[MAHIRU]
Mahiru Shirota. Age 16.

484
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:57,916
I like to keep things simple,

485
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,208
and try to keep
life uncomplicated.

486
00:22:00,291 --> 00:22:01,416
That's why I picked up a cat.

487
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,458
[KURO]
Meow.

488
00:22:02,541 --> 00:22:04,541
[MAHIRU]
I decided to name him Kuro.

489
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:07,208
And he can call out my
name whenever he needs me.

490
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,666
I'll be there!

491
00:23:42,583 --> 00:23:44,083
[MISONO] Listen, idiot,
I'm older than you,

492
00:23:44,166 --> 00:23:45,833
so you have to follow my order!
[snoring]

493
00:23:45,916 --> 00:23:46,958
[TETSU]
He fell asleep.
