1
00:00:08,583 --> 00:00:09,625
[MAHIRU] Maybe you need to
have your eyes checked out.

2
00:00:09,708 --> 00:00:11,000
Get close.

3
00:00:11,083 --> 00:00:13,541
Don't you see a little Kuro
rolling around inside?

4
00:00:13,625 --> 00:00:15,041
[MISONO]
There's nothing in there.

5
00:00:15,125 --> 00:00:17,333
Hey, stop tapping,
hot springs guy.

6
00:00:17,416 --> 00:00:20,333
I'm a delicate ball; you should
be handling me with care.

7
00:00:20,416 --> 00:00:21,333
Plus, it's annoying.

8
00:00:21,416 --> 00:00:22,666
[MAHIRU]
Listen, he's talking now!

9
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:25,416
I don't hear anything. Sorry.

10
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,750
[MISONO]
You may be able to see him,

11
00:00:26,833 --> 00:00:29,625
but to us, this is just
a solid black ball.

12
00:00:29,708 --> 00:00:31,333
At least you can
still talk to him.

13
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,666
[TETSU]
Here's an idea.

14
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,708
We just break the
weird ball so Mister Sloth

15
00:00:35,791 --> 00:00:37,958
is free to lie around and
complain in full size again.

16
00:00:38,041 --> 00:00:39,750
Tetsu! We have to be
super careful about it

17
00:00:39,833 --> 00:00:41,083
We don't know
what this thing is.

18
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:42,083
[TETSU]
Sure thing.

19
00:00:42,166 --> 00:00:43,458
[MAHIRU]
Kuro, tell us if it hurts.

20
00:00:43,541 --> 00:00:44,541
[KURO yelling]

21
00:00:44,625 --> 00:00:45,750
[MAHIRU]
We haven't done anything yet!

22
00:00:45,833 --> 00:00:47,291
All right, get ready.

23
00:00:47,375 --> 00:00:49,541
[MAHIRU]
No! Tetsu, wait.

24
00:00:49,625 --> 00:00:51,041
This isn't right.

25
00:00:51,125 --> 00:00:53,583
It's not how we should be
going about getting Kuro back.

26
00:00:53,666 --> 00:00:55,000
[TETSU]
Uh, are you sure?

27
00:00:55,083 --> 00:00:56,000
Thanks, Mahiru.

28
00:00:56,083 --> 00:00:57,375
[MAHIRU]
Thinking simply,

29
00:00:57,458 --> 00:01:00,791
this is my responsibility.
I'll get him out.

30
00:01:00,875 --> 00:01:02,500
Just sit back and watch, Kuro!

31
00:01:02,583 --> 00:01:04,708
And here I thought you'd
come to your senses.

32
00:01:04,791 --> 00:01:06,750
[KURO screaming]

33
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:40,833
[TETSU] Wow, I can't believe you
couldn't break the dang thing.

34
00:02:40,916 --> 00:02:43,458
Uh, yeah. Do you think we're
going about this the wrong way?

35
00:02:43,541 --> 00:02:45,750
Tetsu, you have some
visitors waiting for you

36
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:47,125
in the lobby.

37
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:48,500
It's about Licht.

38
00:02:48,583 --> 00:02:50,375
He's gone missing.

39
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:51,791
[MAHIRU]
I'm so sorry!

40
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:53,458
I tried to save him,
but couldn't stop them

41
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:55,333
from kidnapping him.

42
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:58,000
In fact, he actually
protected me.

43
00:02:58,083 --> 00:02:59,666
[KRANTZ]
They have Lawless, too.

44
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:02,916
This Tsubaki fellow must be
one immensely strong vampire.

45
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,083
I'm glad to see that you're
still safe, at least.

46
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:06,583
[MAHIRU]
But I should have done more!

47
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:08,500
You know, maybe
this is a good thing.

48
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:11,333
Being held captive may calm
those two down a little bit.

49
00:03:11,416 --> 00:03:13,625
They've been getting far
too out of hand lately.

50
00:03:13,708 --> 00:03:16,041
[MAHIRU]
What? Don't be ridiculous!

51
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:17,916
[MISONO] We'll figure out a way
to rescue the two of them

52
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,125
before midnight.

53
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:20,791
We have to.

54
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:22,375
Their safety is our priority.

55
00:03:22,458 --> 00:03:24,666
We should avoid
conflict if we can.

56
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,833
Is this overgrown mascot
any good in a fight?

57
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:29,666
Yes, of course.
He's Lawless's subclass.

58
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,375
He can take care of himself.

59
00:03:31,458 --> 00:03:32,541
[MISONO]
First things first.

60
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:34,583
We need to hide
Lilac from Tsubaki.

61
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:36,916
I wouldn't be surprised if he
tried to pull one over on us

62
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,250
and make off with our hostage.

63
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:40,833
[MAHIRU]
Hey, Misono.

64
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:44,791
We will let Lila go once we get
Lawless and Licht back, right?

65
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:46,125
That's the deal.

66
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:47,500
[MISONO] In a perfect world
we could rescue them

67
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:49,583
without giving up
our own hostage.

68
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:51,708
That way we could
use Lilac as bait,

69
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:53,291
or in future negotiations.

70
00:03:53,375 --> 00:03:54,875
[MAHIRU]
That's really underhanded.

71
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:56,625
We're getting our friends back.

72
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:58,291
We should hold up our
end of the bargain.

73
00:03:58,375 --> 00:03:59,916
Otherwise, we're the bad guys.

74
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,875
[MISONO groans]
Fine, fine, fine.

75
00:04:01,958 --> 00:04:03,833
You're such a stubborn
bastard sometimes.

76
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:06,791
[LILAC]
Um... Mahiru.

77
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:07,916
Thank you. But...

78
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,333
Why are you doing this for me?

79
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:10,833
Why are you being so nice?

80
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,416
We talked about this.

81
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,166
It's not like I really
wanna fight Tsubaki.

82
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:19,916
I'd rather solve things
peacefully if we can.

83
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,291
What about you, Krantz?

84
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,166
Are you going to be okay
fighting against vampires

85
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,500
with us?

86
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:26,625
Oh, yes.
I have the perfect weapon.

87
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:27,750
Count me in.

88
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:29,708
[MAHIRU]
It's... a water gun?

89
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:31,958
--[KRANTZ] May I see your hand?
--I guess so.

90
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:34,208
See, it's not just
plain water in here.

91
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:37,208
This is harmless to humans,
but against vampires,

92
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:39,500
it's quite toxic.

93
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:40,666
[MAHIRU]
Hugh!

94
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,500
Oh, dear! I had no idea
he was a vampire.

95
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:45,333
[MAHIRU] Seriously?! He's
dressed like a mini Dracula!

96
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:46,916
[KRANTZ]
It's just holy water.

97
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I can use it to knock out any
vampires who might attack me.

98
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:51,000
[HUGH yells]

99
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:52,333
What the hell
were you thinking?

100
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:53,541
I won't forget about this!

101
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:55,083
Oh I do apologize!

102
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:57,666
I keep this around for times
when Lawless gets unreasonable.

103
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:02,041
[MAHIRU] I didn't know
stuff like this existed.

104
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:03,750
Where did you even find it?

105
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:05,791
There's a traveling
antique dealer who sells

106
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:07,708
--this kind of thing.
--[MAHIRU] Antique dealer?

107
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:10,458
Yes. He's a peculiar
little fellow.

108
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:14,375
You know this guy?

109
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:16,666
[MAHIRU]
It's got to be him.

110
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,250
I guess I'll stop by his
shop and see what he has.

111
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:25,125
[MISONO]
That man is bad news.

112
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:26,375
Why do you--

113
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:27,625
[MISONO] He just is, all right?
Don't trust him.

114
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:28,333
But...!

115
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:29,916
Now, Misono,

116
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,375
it's not like we have much of
a choice at a time like this.

117
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,708
[MAHIRU] Plus, I might
be able to get him

118
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:38,666
and the Servamp of Envy
to help us out if I'm lucky.

119
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:42,166
[MISONO] I guess we'll
go our separate ways.

120
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:43,375
For the time being.

121
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:47,916
[MAHIRU]
Misono. Tetsu.

122
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,875
You guys be careful, okay?

123
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:52,958
Ha! You're the one who's
always getting into trouble.

124
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:54,375
We'll be fine.

125
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:56,291
This kind of reckless
mission is right up my alley.

126
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:57,916
[MISONO] What?
This mission is not reckless!

127
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,208
It's gonna be brilliant.

128
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:01,125
[TETSU] You know what?
I believe you.

129
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:02,375
I'm sure it'll be great.

130
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:06,500
[MAHIRU] Again, I'm really
sorry about Licht.

131
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:08,541
I wish I could've helped.

132
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:10,500
I was really impressed
by how talented he is

133
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:12,666
at being the Eve of Greed,
you know.

134
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,500
Licht would hate
to hear you say that.

135
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:16,791
He doesn't believe in talent.

136
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:18,875
Let me tell you about him.

137
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:21,333
Licht grew up in the
countryside of Vienna--

138
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:24,166
a pretty normal child
who liked climbing trees.

139
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,000
But he was a curious boy.

140
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:28,916
He chose to play the piano
completely on his own.

141
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,750
Day after day, he sat
at the bench practicing,

142
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:34,250
imagining a grand audience
weeping in response

143
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:35,875
to his music.

144
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:37,958
Then, when he was
seven years old,

145
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:40,541
there was a big competition.

146
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:44,083
His parents were both world-
travelling musicians themselves.

147
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:46,458
This would be the first
time they heard him play.

148
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:49,416
Licht was ecstatic,
but also nervous.

149
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,875
In fact, his hair
turned completely white

150
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:53,458
from the anxiety.

151
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:56,291
[KRANTZ] He was finally going
to make his dream a reality.

152
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:58,000
In front of his parents,
no less.

153
00:06:58,083 --> 00:06:59,958
But his hair wasn't
the only issue.

154
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:02,375
His mind went blank
when he sat down.

155
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:06,208
However, his hard work
didn't betray him.

156
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:13,958
The audience said that
he played like an angel.

157
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:16,916
Even now, some of
Licht's hair is white.

158
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
It never regained
its original color.

159
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:23,625
You see, it isn't talent
that accomplishes things.

160
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:26,208
It's imagination and effort.

161
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:28,000
So you understand
what I'm saying, right?

162
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:30,208
You, too, can be a
world-famous pianist!

163
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:31,791
[MAHIRU] Uh, wait,
was this whole story

164
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:33,208
some kind of pitch?

165
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,666
[MAHIRU] I hope this
place is easy to find.

166
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:42,750
[KURO yawns]

167
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:45,833
I'm so sleepy from
all that sawing earlier.

168
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:47,333
Time to take a nap.

169
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:01,708
[MAHIRU]
Hey, Kuro. You awake?

170
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:02,833
Hello?

171
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:06,125
[MAHIRU gasps]
A fox?! What the hell?!

172
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:07,625
[TSUBAKI]
What a tease.

173
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:11,208
I was hoping I'd catch my
subclass here alone with you.

174
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:12,583
I know that voice!

175
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:16,083
[MAHIRU]
Kuro, hide!

176
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:24,666
[beeping noise]

177
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,375
There wasn't an explosion.

178
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:31,000
It wasn't real.

179
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:32,791
But that was Tsubaki. Right?

180
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:34,583
[KURO]
Hey, what's going on?

181
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:37,041
That was a really
bouncy wake-up call.

182
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:38,666
[MAHIRU]
Kuro! You okay?

183
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,125
[KURO yawns]

184
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:41,708
Yeah, of course I am.

185
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:43,333
I'm a vampire; I'm immortal.

186
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:45,250
You should worry about yourself.

187
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:46,875
You're way too killable.

188
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:50,166
[MAHIRU] It's hard to take you
seriously when you're so tiny.

189
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:53,125
But... I'm glad you're okay.
And that you still have

190
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:55,416
your sense of humor,
despite everything.

191
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:58,500
[MAHIRU]
Tsubaki's already on the move.

192
00:08:58,583 --> 00:08:59,666
So we should be, too!

193
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:04,958
[TSUBAKI] Mahiru, the Eve of
Sloth, doesn't have the hostage.

194
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:06,291
What a pity.

195
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:08,250
Time to move on.

196
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:10,458
Now, who's next?

197
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:13,958
[laughing]

198
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,916
[JOHANN]
Welcome back, Miku-Miku.

199
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I'm afraid I have some
bad news to report to you.

200
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:25,333
I accidentally broke something
that you treasure today.

201
00:09:25,416 --> 00:09:26,916
I'm so sorry!

202
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,625
But honestly, it's your fault
for putting something

203
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:30,166
of such value
within my reaching,

204
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:31,625
knowing me like you do.

205
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:33,375
Really, it couldn't be helped!

206
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:34,625
It's not that bad.

207
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:36,625
Just missing a face.

208
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:38,416
But don't worry,
I melted the head down

209
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,000
and made it into a special
potion just for you.

210
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:42,708
Just think! This doll
you love so much

211
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:44,208
will forever be a part of you.

212
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:45,666
Doesn't that sound wonderful?

213
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:48,166
The two of you as one, and
you have me to thank for it.

214
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,208
[JOHANN]
Cheers!

215
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:51,833
[laughing]

216
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:55,458
Who are you?

217
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:03,625
[MAHIRU] This place looks
more like a convenience store

218
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:06,708
than an antique shop.

219
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:08,708
[MAHIRU]
So, the reason I'm here...

220
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:11,375
[JOHANN]
Mikuni isn't in right now.

221
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:13,416
Mikuni?

222
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,291
Uh... Right, so what
are you doing here?

223
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:19,333
Are you one of Mikuni's
employees or just a friend?

224
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:22,125
[JOHANN]
A friend? Of that guy?

225
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:24,083
I'd rather die.

226
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:26,208
What about you? Are you
one of Mikuni's servants?

227
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:27,666
I'm no servant!

228
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:31,000
I'm just an acquaintance of
his named Mahiru Shirota.

229
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:33,041
Haruka Satou,
that's a nice name.

230
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:34,375
[MAHIRU]
What?!

231
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:36,666
How did you manage
to get every syllable wrong?!

232
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,458
Mahiru Shirota, eh?

233
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:44,291
Welcome to...
my research laboratory!

234
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:46,041
Now, have a seat, Kakeru Yamada.

235
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:47,500
Mahiru Shirota!

236
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:49,166
[JOHANN] Why don't you let
the good doctor examine you

237
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,416
while you wait?

238
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,458
Have some, uh, tea.

239
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:52,958
Wait... what is this?

240
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:55,458
[JOHANN] Just a welcome
drink for the Eve of Sloth!

241
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:57,291
Cheers, Mitsuru Hanaoka!

242
00:10:57,375 --> 00:10:58,708
Who the hell is that?

243
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:00,708
[JOHANN sighs] I guess I
should admit I'm not very good

244
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:02,250
at catching people's names.

245
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:04,375
There are more important
things to remember.

246
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:07,958
[MAHIRU] Hey, stop!
What are you doing to me?!

247
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:09,583
[JOHANN]
There, that should help.

248
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:13,083
[JOHANN]
Welcome, Mahiru Shirota!

249
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:15,083
[laughing]

250
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:16,958
[MAHIRU]
Uh, so, who are you again?

251
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:19,541
[JOHANN] I'm part scholar
and part researcher.

252
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:21,541
Vampires are my specialty.

253
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:23,000
Huh?

254
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:26,666
Johannes Mimir Faustus, here.

255
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,625
That's technically my name.

256
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:31,666
The letters that denote
my individuality.

257
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:34,333
But you can call me
Doctor, or Hans.

258
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:37,041
Johannes, Faust, or Mimir.

259
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:38,375
Whatever you like, really.

260
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:40,666
--The more important thing--
--[MIKUNI] Johann!

261
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,625
Welcome back, Miku-Miku!

262
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:47,916
I told you not to come
here without asking!

263
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,375
And where, exactly, did my
dear Violeta's head go, huh?

264
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:51,333
[MAHIRU]
Uh, hi?

265
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:53,125
[MIKUNI]
Oh, hi, Mahiru.

266
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:54,666
Do you have some
business at my store?

267
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,833
Um, well... maybe.

268
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:58,583
Miku, is it?

269
00:11:58,666 --> 00:12:01,541
[MIKUNI] Oh, that's right,
I never told you my name.

270
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:03,625
I'm Mikuni Alicein.

271
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:05,666
Nice to see you.

272
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:08,791
Thanks so much for looking
out for my little brother.

273
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:12,166
You're... Misono's big brother?!

274
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:13,833
That can't be right!

275
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:16,500
[MISONO] He just is,
all right? Don't trust him.

276
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:18,541
But why didn't Misono
say anything?

277
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:20,041
Is there bad blood
between you two?

278
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:21,125
Enough chit-chat!

279
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:22,791
I want to touch
this vampire of yours.

280
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:24,958
He's a cat, right?
The Servamp of Sloth!

281
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:27,458
So where is he? Where are you
hiding him, this powerful beast?

282
00:12:27,541 --> 00:12:29,208
Don't be shy, bring him on out!

283
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:32,791
No way!

284
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:35,625
[MAHIRU] I'm trying to find a
way to get him back to normal.

285
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:38,875
[JOHANN] Ah, a problem
in need of examination!

286
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:41,125
Cheers to the unexpected!

287
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:43,750
Oh, if only we could
freeze in this moment.

288
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:47,041
It's just so beautiful,
I think that I might cry.

289
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:49,166
[JOHANN] Thank you for
bringing this oddity!

290
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,583
Now, into my laboratory!

291
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:54,958
[MAHIRU]
Ow...

292
00:12:57,916 --> 00:13:00,291
What? I didn't break
the glass or anything.

293
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:01,958
Must be some kinda
revolving door.

294
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:03,250
Man, that's weird.

295
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:05,250
[JOHANN] It's time for
some fun experiments

296
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:06,375
with the good doctor.

297
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:07,750
Are you excited?

298
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:12,041
[MISONO] I had Doudou
examine this photo we found

299
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,208
on Higan's phone.

300
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:16,000
He thinks he's
traced its origin.

301
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:18,125
[DOUDOU]
There's no mistake about it.

302
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:20,666
It's definitely the Tokyo
Opera Hall in the background.

303
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,166
Got it?

304
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:23,375
There's only one place where
that could have been taken,

305
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:25,166
considering the angle
in the picture.

306
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:28,416
[MISONO]
They're in one of the top floors

307
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,041
of the Tokyo World Tree Hotel.

308
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:32,333
That's their base.

309
00:13:32,416 --> 00:13:33,500
[TETSU]
Nice!

310
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:35,333
[MISONO]
The hotel has 45 floors,

311
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:37,208
plus five more underground.

312
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:38,958
Taking advantage
of that much height,

313
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:40,875
an Eve and a Servamp
could be separated

314
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:42,416
beyond their distance limit.

315
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,083
I see.

316
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:44,250
[KRANTZ]
Okay.

317
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:45,708
So Licht and Lawless
should be on the top

318
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:47,333
and bottom floors of the hotel.

319
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:50,125
Tsubaki's guarding them,
and he has help.

320
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:51,708
Higan, his strongest subclass,

321
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:54,333
is probably also keeping
an eye on those two.

322
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:55,625
He's dangerous.

323
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:57,208
[TETSU] You know,
you're really good at this.

324
00:13:57,291 --> 00:13:59,750
You shouldn't be so
impressed by common sense.

325
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:00,916
After analyzing the facts,

326
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,916
this seems like the
most likely setup.

327
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:03,916
[TETSU]
All right.

328
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,541
I'm gonna get some rest, then.

329
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:06,750
[MISONO]
You're leaving it to us?

330
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:08,041
[TETSU] Just tell me
what you want me to do

331
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:09,791
once you figure it out.

332
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:11,666
Don't worry, I'm good
at this kinda thing.

333
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,083
[HUGH] Yes, it's a smart idea
to recover as much stamina

334
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:15,666
as possible before we begin.

335
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,791
Idiots. Don't you want a say?

336
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:19,708
Your lives are gonna be
on the line too, you know.

337
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:21,125
Don't you care?

338
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:22,375
I do.

339
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:24,625
But I also trust that
you'll do what's best.

340
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,500
Well, after a vote
of confidence like that,

341
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:32,875
we'd better make a good plan.

342
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:35,666
Like I wouldn't
do that to begin with.

343
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,708
The first thing we need
to do is to scout the hotel

344
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:39,708
from the inside.

345
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:41,208
But that could be a problem.

346
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:43,791
The subclasses definitely
know our faces by now.

347
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:45,125
You're right.
We need someone who can

348
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:47,041
slip past them unrecognized.

349
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,250
[JOHANN]
165.2 centimeters.

350
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:54,625
You're kinda short, you know.

351
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:56,583
What's the point of all
these measurements, huh?

352
00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:57,666
Quiet down.

353
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,458
--I'll need some hair.
--[MAHIRU] Ouch!

354
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:01,083
[JOHANN]
Any history of chronic illness?

355
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:02,583
[MAHIRU]
I'm fine!

356
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:04,625
Kuro's the one you're supposed
to be looking at, not me.

357
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:05,750
I want--

358
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,166
What do you plan
to do if you manage

359
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:11,958
to get Sloth back to normal?

360
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:14,250
Are you going
to go after Tsubaki?

361
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:17,625
Do you have some kind
of plan to stop him?

362
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:19,958
You are aware that
vampires are immortal.

363
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:21,708
But do you really know
how to break them?

364
00:15:21,791 --> 00:15:23,916
Break them?
What are you talking about?

365
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:26,625
Wait, I get it.

366
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:28,958
Are you saying you know
a way to kill vampires?

367
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:31,791
You're horribly uninformed.

368
00:15:31,875 --> 00:15:35,375
As an Eve, you should really
know how these things work.

369
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:38,083
Vampires are essentially
immortal, true.

370
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:42,083
But subclasses can be broken if
a Servamp drinks their blood.

371
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:45,583
You could call it
a form of cannibalism.

372
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:48,916
There's also a way
to break a Servamp.

373
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,916
Using their name and their item,

374
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,833
the two things that connect
an Eve and a Servamp together.

375
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:55,541
You gave Sloth
an object and a name

376
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:58,000
to make a contract,
and that's his weakness.

377
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:00,291
Huh? No, I didn't
give him anything.

378
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:04,291
Crap! Yeah, I did!

379
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:05,458
His little cat bell!

380
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:07,166
I didn't think anything of it!

381
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:10,875
[MIKUNI] Servamps are sins,
and Eves their salvation.

382
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:12,583
In order to break
their connection,

383
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:15,916
you must destroy the item
an Eve gave to his Servamp.

384
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,375
Do that, and the
Servamp... well...

385
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:21,166
[MAHIRU]
This is good to know,

386
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:23,500
but all I want to do right now
is get Kuro back to normal.

387
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:25,666
[JOHANN] There's no known
method for doing so.

388
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:28,708
Servamps cause all sorts
of unexplained phenomena.

389
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:30,208
But I never thought
I'd get to witness

390
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:32,291
something like this up close.

391
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:33,666
Tell me, Doctor,

392
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:36,250
you're not an Eve
or a subclass, right?

393
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:39,500
So why do you research vampires?

394
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:41,875
Maybe I just enjoy
a good challenge.

395
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:48,208
I'm on a boat, rowing
against the current.

396
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:50,500
Always fighting to get upstream.

397
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:51,958
If you truly want knowledge,

398
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:54,666
you have to seek it out with
every ounce of your will.

399
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,541
Stop to rest and
you'll fall behind.

400
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:58,458
Humans have no time
to catch their breath.

401
00:16:58,541 --> 00:17:01,250
There's only one way to get
whatever you yearn for.

402
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:03,000
Nothing begins without action.

403
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:05,458
If you do nothing, then
you're sure to gain nothing!

404
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:08,250
Satisfaction is stagnation,
which is death.

405
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:10,125
I want to know, see, and feel.

406
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:12,083
To experience and understand!

407
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:13,625
To learn everything!

408
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:15,041
This monster is amazing,

409
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:17,583
but we know next to
nothing about him!

410
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:19,416
He has such incredible strength.

411
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,291
He's won every battle
he's ever fought!

412
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:22,916
The ultimate soldier!

413
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,541
And now there's a
war between vampires?

414
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:27,958
Perhaps I should thank
the Servamp of Melancholy

415
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:30,916
for allowing me to see
something so fascinating.

416
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,625
In every era, wars have
forced us towards progress.

417
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:37,416
I want Sloth to revert back
so he can use his powers

418
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,458
to do just that.

419
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:42,791
Sure, but... it's not
that I want his power.

420
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:46,583
I want to learn from Kuro and
become the kind of person

421
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:48,250
who can face him as an equal.

422
00:17:50,541 --> 00:17:54,625
[JOHANN] I have no interest in
such sentimental motivations.

423
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:56,208
Here, have some tea.

424
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:57,250
Thank you.

425
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:01,291
I don't know any
foolproof way

426
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:02,875
of getting him out of there.

427
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:05,250
But there is a radical solution
that I think's is worth trying.

428
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:09,625
[MAHIRU gasps]

429
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:11,708
[JOHANN] Of course, what I'm
proposing is a human Eve

430
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:13,708
entering the mind of
a Servamp and interacting

431
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:15,000
with him directly.

432
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:18,166
Taking unnecessary
risks as usual, I see.

433

[MAHIRU]
What... did I just drink?

434
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:22,125
[JOHANN] Luckily,
I've already concocted a way

435
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:23,708
to get into a Servamp's mind.

[laughs]

437
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:26,583
I can't believe I'm
getting to test it on

Good luck to you,

How about a poem as you depart?

[MIKUNI]
The Cat and the Unicorn

442
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:42,625

Some gave them no flower,

and sent them out of town.

I watched Lust and Pride
and couldn't find

a sign of him anywhere.

Well, it is about time
they called me back!

[TSUBAKI]
Ah, yes, hello?

455

Uh-huh, it's me. Oh?

456

That's it.

They've called for me.
I'm off now.

458

[SHAMROCK] It must be
a trap, young master.

Don't trust them!

We should be the
ones to go instead.

461
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:27,625
[TSUBAKI] It's not that I don't
have faith in all of you.

462
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:30,083
Quite the opposite.

463
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:33,041
I'm going because I know you
can hold down the fort here.

Surely you understand
how much I believe in you.

No matter who
deceives me in life,

472
00:19:57,541 --> 00:19:59,666
Right. That means it's
time for us to move.

473
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:00,833
[LILLY]
Um, Misono?

474
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:02,666
Is this some kind
of cosplay, or...?

475
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:04,041
They're disguises!

476
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:07,000
Disguises are a must during
infiltration missions.

477
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:09,416
I've increased my height
by 15 centimeters.

478
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,583
No one will recognize me!
[laughs]

479
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:14,500
[LILLY] That's wonderful,
but don't trip, please.

480
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:16,333
[KRANTZ]
Excuse me.

481
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:18,625
Are there any rooms available
on your highest floor here?

482
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:20,416
Let me check for you.
Just one moment please!

483
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:23,375
[KRANTZ]
Arigato! Tokyo is amazin'!

484
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:25,958
Shibuya, Harajuku, let's see...

485
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:28,833
[MISONO] He's kind of overdoing
it with this tourist bit.

486
00:20:28,916 --> 00:20:29,916
[DESK CLERK 8A]
I am very sorry, sir,

487
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,500
but we currently have
long-term guests

488
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:33,666
occupying floors 43 and above.

489
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:37,500
[KRANTZ] I asked about
the basement, too.

490
00:20:37,583 --> 00:20:40,000
Seems they only use the
first four floors for parking.

491
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:42,000
The fifth must be where
they're keeping him.

492
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:44,125
I guess that would
make the most sense.

493
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:45,291
Bastards.

494
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:47,541
[KRANTZ] I got a room
on the 41st floor.

495
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:49,291
This cardkey will let
you take the elevator

496
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:50,875
above the 40th floor.

497
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:51,958
Take it.

498
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:54,416
You stay here
and be on the lookout

499
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:57,541
for anything suspicious
in the lobby.

500
00:20:57,625 --> 00:20:58,833
Okay, Sendagaya.

501
00:20:58,916 --> 00:21:00,875
I'll take the elevator
as we discussed.

502
00:21:00,958 --> 00:21:02,666
Stand by for my signal.

503
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:03,750
[TETSU]
Got it.

504
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:06,416
[MISONO]
Our goal isn't to defeat him.

505
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:09,375
If we can rescue them and escape
before Tsubaki comes back,

506
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:10,833
then we'll be successful.

507
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:17,166
[MISONO]
Sakuya Watanuki?

508
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:20,291
Does he know?

509
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:22,833
Or is he just in the elevator
going back to home base?

510
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:25,250
Oh, did you think
we were going up?

511
00:21:29,333 --> 00:21:30,916
I hate being a liar.

512
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,625
But I don't have
much of a choice.

513
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:37,416
The words "I believe
in you" are a burden.

514
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,916
No... They're some
kind of spell.

515
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,916
And once you hear them,
you're cursed.

516
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,208
You have to be loyal
to whoever said them.

517
00:21:45,291 --> 00:21:48,750
You thought you pushed
the button for the 41st floor.

518
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:51,166
But shouldn't that button
be towards the top?

519
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:54,125
So why did you hit
the one so far down?

520
00:21:54,208 --> 00:21:55,666
You should check again.

521
00:21:57,166 --> 00:21:59,791
[MISONO]
Whoa! The button order flipped!

522
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:01,666
[SAKUYA]
You look confused.

523
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:04,916
This is why I hate lying.

524
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,333
I really wish...
I didn't have to lie again!

525
00:23:42,541 --> 00:23:43,500
[JOHANN]
Let me borrow this doll.

526
00:23:43,583 --> 00:23:44,666
I promise I won't hurt her.

527
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:46,208
[MIKUNI]
Don't touch my Abel, pervert!

528
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:47,000
Get away!
