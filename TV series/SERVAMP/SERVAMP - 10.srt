Piano recital, huh?

00:00:20,041 --> 00:00:21,583
[ACTRESS 10A]
Yeah, I have to.

3
00:00:21,666 --> 00:00:24,666
It'll be worth it for dinner
with my boyfriend after, though.

4
00:00:26,333 --> 00:00:28,708
Shouldn't you be focusing
on your next role?

5
00:00:28,791 --> 00:00:30,333
Learning your lines?

6
00:00:30,416 --> 00:00:33,000
Lately, your acting
has been a little... off.

7
00:00:33,083 --> 00:00:35,166
[ACTRESS 10A]
Don't worry about my career.

8
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,000
[LAWLESS]
You were such a great actress--

9
00:00:37,083 --> 00:00:40,791
enchanting the silver screen
with moving performances.

10
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:42,750
I expected more from you.

11
00:00:42,833 --> 00:00:44,416
[LAWLESS]
Crap, I'm late.

12
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:45,791
Oh, well.

13
00:00:45,875 --> 00:00:47,875
It looks like he's about to
begin the second piece.

Jekylland Licht Todoroki.

17
00:00:57,083 --> 00:01:00,000
Everyone who hears him
play says he's unique--

18
00:01:00,083 --> 00:01:03,916
an angel whose music
moves audiences to tears.

19
00:01:05,041 --> 00:01:07,166
You're the next one.

[ACTRESS 10A]
Are you coming to dinner, too?

21
00:01:09,166 --> 00:01:12,083
I can call ahead and get
a seat for you in the corner.

22
00:01:12,166 --> 00:01:14,541
Nah. You have fun on your date.

[ACTRESS 10A] Don't tell me
you've got another weird

part-time job.

25
00:01:17,916 --> 00:01:19,833
Whatever, just don't
go too far away.

26
00:01:19,916 --> 00:01:21,000
[LAWLESS]
Be careful.

27
00:01:21,083 --> 00:01:22,875
I'd hate for something
to happen to you.

28
00:01:24,416 --> 00:01:25,416
Goodbye.

[LICHT] What, nothing to say
when we're face to face?

30
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:11,791
Pull yourself together.

31
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:14,541
I've been thinking...

32
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:17,166
I don't care whether
you're immortal or not.

33
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:20,708
It's my duty as an angel
to kill you here and now.

34
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:23,625
Any last words for me, Lawless?

[LAWLESS laughs]

36
00:03:25,416 --> 00:03:27,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah. All right.

37
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:29,208
That's the kind of
crazy talk I'd expect

38
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:30,541
from someone like you.

39
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:33,166
A self-proclaimed angel
wants me dead.

40
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:34,625
When really you
should be buried here

41
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:36,583
before you screw
anything else up!

42
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:40,000
[LAWLESS]
My gloomy angel.

43
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:43,083
I don't know what makes you
think you're so damn important.

44
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:44,625
Haven't I made it
clear that your life

45
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:47,375
is just as insignificant as
all the others in this world?

46

[LICHT] Don't pretend
that I'm not special.

[LAWLESS]
Jekylland Licht Todoroki.

48
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:55,041
I'll prove how meaningless
your life is by killing you.

49
00:03:57,041 --> 00:03:58,958
You're the one
who's going to die.

50
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:00,083
You bastard.

51
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:02,166
What is that?

52
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,625
The building's shaking.

53
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:06,541
Huh? Sounds like something
bad is happening next door.

54
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:11,000
[LAWLESS] What the hell
is wrong with me?

55
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:13,291
My body feels so heavy.

56
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:15,708
And my wounds are
healing really slowly.

57
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:18,958
But if I'm in this bad a shape,
he must be much worse.

58
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:21,458
After all, he's only human.

00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:23,125
Let's get this
over with already.

How do you like being
crushed beneath my boot,

Hedgehog?

62
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:40,208
[LAWLESS]
What was that?

63
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:42,541
Are you okay, my angel?

64
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:44,208
Why are you getting up?

65
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:46,083
You'll die if we keep fighting.

66
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:47,708
Just give up already.

68
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,750
Okay. That's enough.

69
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:56,458
How about we just decide
to agree to disagree, huh?

70
00:04:57,458 --> 00:04:59,458
To be honest,
I'm over this fight.

You really are amazing, Licht.

Set your mind to it
and you can do anything.

[LICHT]
Agree to disagree?

00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:10,125
You're a coward.

77
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:12,208
That's just something
people say when they're wrong.

78
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:13,500
You don't even
have the motivation

79
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:15,083
to fight for yourself.

80
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:17,791
Listen, angel babes,

81
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:21,125
I'm just trying to teach you
something about real life here.

82
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:23,750
You and me and everyone else
are just anonymous parts

83
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:25,208
of a faceless mob.

84
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:26,416
[LICHT]
Anonymous?

85
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,750
Everyone in the world
is their own person.

86
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:31,458
Well, actually, no,
that's not true.

87
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:33,791
You're not a real
person, hedgehog.

88
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:36,333
You strut around the stage,
but the only things you spout

89
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:37,750
are tired old lines.

90
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:39,541
You don't even have a real name.

91
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:41,958
I'll teach you one lesson
before I end you.

92
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:43,458
You're defined by what you want

93
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:45,583
and how hard you work
toward getting it.

94
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:46,458
Your dream...

95
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:47,958
That's what creates character.

96
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:51,916
It's what really makes a person,
or even a vampire, unique.

97
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,500
You want nothing,
and you have no ambition.

98
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:56,375
You can't call any
life "meaningless."

99
00:05:56,458 --> 00:05:58,166
Not unless you're doing
something with your own,

The one and only
Servamp of Greed?

What a joke.

103
00:06:02,916 --> 00:06:05,125
You don't have a single desire.

104
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:06,708
You may think you're special.

105
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:08,000
But you're the worst of all.

106

If anyone is worthless,
it's you!

Shut your mouth!

[PUCK] How'd it go?
Were you able to get anything?

120
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,666
[OPHELIA] Yes, the biggest
fruit on the tree.

121

Here you go.

122
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:52,583
That's amazing!

123
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:53,583
Thank you so much!

124

[LAWLESS]
Ophelia!

125
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:58,625
[laughs] You're right. I didn't
thank you for breaking my fall.

126
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:00,250
[LAWLESS]
What are you doing out here?

127
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:02,500
[OPHELIA] Puck is going
to have a baby sister soon.

128
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:04,416
We're gathering
fruit to celebrate.

129
00:07:05,916 --> 00:07:07,416
[OPHELIA]
This makes me so happy.

130
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,625
[LAWLESS]
Huh?

131
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:09,916
We're growing.

132
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,166
Every day my country
gets bigger and stronger.

133
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:14,125
Yeah. Sure.

134
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:15,625
By the way, it feels
like you've gotten

135
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:16,916
a little heavier, Ophelia.

136
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,458
[OPHELIA laughs]
I'm just getting older.

137
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:22,625
All of us have to
grow up sometime, right?

138
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:23,791
Yeah, I know.

139
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:58,291
[OPHELIA]
A marriage has been arranged.

140
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:02,125
I don't know why you look
so surprised about that.

141
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:04,666
It's to the neighboring
country's prince.

142
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,750
The whole thing's
kind of sudden, I know.

143
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:09,625
But the fighting at our borders
can no longer be contained.

144
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:11,333
If I don't do something
to stop it soon,

145
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:14,375
we'll have a full-blown
war on our hands.

146
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:16,625
Marriage is the best way
to form a lasting alliance

147
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:18,083
and resolve this.

148
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:19,250
Let's run away.

149
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:21,208
It's crazy to marry
for that reason.

150
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:22,666
Run away with me.

151
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:25,666
We can have real freedom,
just the two of us, Ophelia.

152
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:31,750
I'm afraid freedom
isn't what I desire.

153
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:34,208
Okay, then tell me what
it is you actually want!

154
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:37,583
I'll do whatever it takes
to make sure you get it.

155
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:39,083
Come on, there has
to be something else

156
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:40,416
that you yearn for.

157
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,000
[OPHELIA]
Well, there is something, yes.

158
00:08:42,083 --> 00:08:43,666
Perfect!
Let's go out and get it.

159
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:46,208
[OPHELIA] I want for our two

[OPHELIA] I'll be moving
to the new country.

That means we're going to have
