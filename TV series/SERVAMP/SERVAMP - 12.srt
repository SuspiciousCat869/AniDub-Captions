[TSUBAKI]
I found you, dear.

6
00:00:17,458 --> 00:00:20,416
So you were the hostage.
Don't worry, I'm here now.

7
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:21,791
[MAHIRU]
Tsubaki?

8
00:00:21,875 --> 00:00:24,375
[TSUBAKI] You must have been
so frightened all alone.

9
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:26,958
I'm sorry it took so long
for me to find you.

10
00:00:27,041 --> 00:00:29,625
Now, give me that.

11
00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:33,541
[MISONO] What's going on?
Why is Tsubaki already back?

12
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:36,250
[TSUBAKI]
Wow, you even defeated Higan.

13
00:00:36,333 --> 00:00:37,958
It looks like Greed and his Eve

14
00:00:38,041 --> 00:00:40,208
really went on a
rampage in here.

15
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:41,791
What a mess.

16
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:44,791
[TSUBAKI]
Oh. Hey, Big Brother Sloth.

17
00:00:44,875 --> 00:00:49,166
I finally found it... Teacher.

18
00:01:01,375 --> 00:01:03,666
No, Licht, stay back.

19
00:01:05,958 --> 00:01:09,791
You can't take this guy on,
he's too powerful.

20
00:01:09,875 --> 00:01:13,875
[LAWLESS] Dumb angel. Look at
you, you're hardly standing.

21
00:01:13,958 --> 00:01:18,291
And my body feels so heavy.
We can't fight him.

22
00:01:18,375 --> 00:01:19,791
Brother!

23
00:01:19,875 --> 00:01:22,625
I'll take care of it.

00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:25,458

So that's our enemy.

happened to Hugh, right?

Don't do anything crazy!

00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:13,375
Where is he?

33
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:17,791
[TSUBAKI] Ah. The one who
fell for Berukia's move?

[TETSU growls]

[TSUBAKI] Anyone who gets
trapped in his magic box

36
00:03:21,666 --> 00:03:25,333
is teleported into an identical
one I carry with me.

37
00:03:25,416 --> 00:03:27,250
Don't you think
the Servamp of Pride

38
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:30,250
made a wonderful assistant
to my magician?

39
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:34,625
It's almost a shame we made
him disappear forever.

40
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:37,458
You didn't...

41
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:39,291
Hugh...

42
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:46,541
[MAHIRU] Tsubaki. Tell us.
What are you trying to do here?

43
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:51,250
[TSUBAKI laughs] Just what
I was put on Earth to do.

[gasps]

45

[TSUBAKI]
You see, my late teacher

46
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:58,541
wants me to clean up after him.

47
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:02,125
This is one messy world
that he left behind.

48
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:06,083
[MAHIRU]
Blood? No... Flowers...

49
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:12,291
[TSUBAKI] I'm an instrument.
I am a cleansing rain.

50
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,791
And as fate would have it,

51
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:19,791
I am the only person who
can destroy a Servamp.

52
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:24,458
I am Melancholy.
I'm here to break you.

53
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:27,500
Your contracts, your worthless
bonds with each other,

54
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:30,125
mean nothing to me.

55
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:33,250
Stop! Don't!

56
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:38,208

[TSUBAKI]
Get out of my way, Sleepy Ash.

60
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:56,916
It's time for me to
kill our brother.

61
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,416
To do that, I have
to cut off his head.

62
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:03,041
It has to drop like a
fading camellia flower.

63
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:05,250
[KURO grunts]
You sure are troublesome

64
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:07,000
for being the baby of the group.

65
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:09,666
[TSUBAKI laughs]
You mean you accept it?

66
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:12,666
You admit that I'm your little
brother? Part of the family?

67
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:16,125
[KURO] I don't think I
have much of a choice.

68
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:17,875
My creator is the only one

69
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:20,916
who could have made someone
as monstrous as you.

70
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,541
[TSUBAKI]
That's right. He was a genius.

71
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:26,916
I've been searching
for you a long time.

72
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,291
Ever since you
murdered my teacher.

73
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:30,291
[KURO growls]

74
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:31,541
[TSUBAKI]
You are the black lion

75
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:33,916
who murdered that man in
cold blood, aren't you?

76
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,583
Who took the life of
our creator? Our father?

77
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:42,375
[TSUBAKI]
Wonderful!

78
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:45,041
There's something I've
been dying to ask you.

79
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:47,250
Tell me, Sloth...

80
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:48,250
[KURO gasps]

81
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:49,500
[TSUBAKI]
...you were the only one

82
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:51,583
who could have heard my
teacher's last words.

83
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:55,166
What did he say before
you took his life away?

84
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:58,666
[KURO] I didn't exactly stop
to have a chat with him.

85
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,833
[TSUBAKI]
Is that so?

86
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,666
[TSUBAKI]
My teacher had not met

87
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:05,333
with any of my siblings
since I was born.

88
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:09,750
You were the were the last one
to see him. You, the black lion.

89
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:13,291
I can only imagine his surprise
at seeing you, Sleepy Ash.

90
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:15,083
And he said nothing?

91
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:18,375
Not a single word
escaped from his lips?

92
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:22,750
Ahh... Or is it just that
you refused to listen?

93
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:25,958
Well, I guess it doesn't
matter in the end.

94
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:29,708
Wait. Of course. That's right.

95
00:06:29,791 --> 00:06:32,541
I was the only one
he had plans for.

96
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:36,458
The only one he
gave a mission to.

97
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:38,791
[KURO]
So what did he want you to do?

98
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:41,333
Why did he create you,
the eighth true vampire?

99
00:06:41,416 --> 00:06:44,083
Oh, so now you want
to talk, is that it?!

100
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:48,791
[laughs] You should have
asked him yourself,

101
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:50,791
while you had the
chance, Brother.

102
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:53,083
[KURO growls]

103
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:55,125
Where are you, Hyde?!

[LICHT]
Stupid hedgehog.

106
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:09,083
Misono! Tetsu! Get out of here!

107
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:14,041
[MISONO grunting]
Shirota! What are you doing?

108
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:18,250
[coughs] Kuro...

109
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:20,666
[KURO]
I know I was wrong.

110
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:21,916
I realize that now,

111
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,708
after running from my
feelings for so long.

112
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:29,000
That's why I'm not running
away now. Or stepping back.

113
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:31,166
I'm facing you head on.

114
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:34,125
I'm going to settle this
with you right now.

115
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:38,208
We should be conversing
with words, not weapons.

116
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:40,500
Don't you think so?

117
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:42,875
That sounds nice, sure,
but I don't think you

118
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:46,416
and I are ever going to be
able to agree on anything.

119
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,208
Besides, didn't you
kill my teacher

120
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:50,333
without ever trying
to talk to him?

121
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:52,250
So why should we
have a family chat

122
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:54,166
before you try to
murder me, huh?

123
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:56,375
[KURO] Can't you see
I regret what I did?

124
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:57,875
[KURO groans]

125
00:07:57,958 --> 00:08:01,041
So weak! [laughs]

126
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:03,583
You don't act like you
actually regret it!

127
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:04,833
If you really did,

128
00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:07,291
you'd find some way to
repent for your sins.

129
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:08,750
[TSUBAKI]
Hey...

130
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:12,541
...just how connected are we
as long lost brothers, hm?

131
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:15,250
I wonder... Do we think alike?

132
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:18,916
Do we become happy in the same
way, worried in the same way,

133
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,291
angry in the same way?
What do you think, Brother?

134
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:24,708
If so, wouldn't we agree
about everything?

135
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:26,125
And yet here we are fighting.

136
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:28,208
Wouldn't it make things
so much easier?

137
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:31,541
That way I'd understand you and
you'd understand me, as one.

138
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:32,916
But that's not the case here.

139
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,083
I'm alone, and you
are, too, Brother.

140
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:36,458
There's a rift between us.

141
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:39,708
It's probably just
a misunderstanding.

142
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:42,458
People reject the things
they don't understand.

143
00:08:42,541 --> 00:08:45,500
It's a mechanism we have to
protect our sense of purpose.

144
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:49,458
Doubting yourself can lead
to destruction, after all.

145
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:55,125
Here! See for yourself,
the destruction of the world!

[laughing continues]

152
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:41,583
[TSUBAKI] I don't think
there's anything left

153
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:47,166
for us to talk about. [laughs]

154
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:50,416
I don't really give a damn
what you want, Tsubaki.

155
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,833
[TSUBAKI]
Uh...?

156
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,541
I'll stop you even if it means
I have to destroy you.

00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:02,666
[TSUBAKI] That threat isn't
interesting at all, Brother.

161
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:10,250
Dammit, there are still
important things

162
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:11,750
we have to talk about.

163
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:14,166
Like what happened that night.

164
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:16,375
And what you did to Greed.

165
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:20,833
I don't want to regret
things anymore.

166

[KURO panting]

167
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:28,500
[TSUBAKI] Tell me again, did
my teacher really not speak

168
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:32,541
about me at all before you
murdered him? Not a word?

169
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:33,958
[KURO]
Uh.

170
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:37,708
Why did he remain silent?

171
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:40,791
Why did he keep me a secret,
why didn't he tell anyone,

172
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:44,000
even my own family,
about my existence?

173

[MIKUNI]
Hey, kid.

176
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:56,375
[MAHIRU]
Is that you, Mikuni?

177
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:58,000
[MIKUNI]
Tell me. Why didn't you run away

178
00:10:58,083 --> 00:10:59,958
when you had the chance, huh?

179
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:03,458
Sometimes it's hard to tell if
you're brave or just stupid.

180
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:06,375
[panting]

181
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:10,375
I couldn't go. I have
to look out for Kuro.

182
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:13,041
[MIKUNI grunts]
I don't think this situation

183
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:16,833
calls for your help any longer.

184
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:20,666
It's a family matter. It won't
stop until one of them breaks.

185
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:23,125
[MAHIRU]
You're wrong!

186
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:25,541
Kuro's finally
facing everything.

187
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:28,666
Not just his brother,

188
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:31,125
but also his own past.

189
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:36,833
[MIKUNI] If he's taking
responsibility for that...

190
00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:40,750
...then let him. That's
Sloth's problem, not yours.

191
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:46,166
No. If I'm useless, there's
no point being an Eve.

192
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:55,875
[MAHIRU]
I'm Kuro's partner.

[KURO groaning]

195
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:04,000
Ah, look at us, Brother,

196
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:07,583
these are the games we could
have been playing all our lives.

197
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:11,291
[KURO groans]

198
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:12,583
Get away from him.

199
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:15,625
[TSUBAKI] You're spoiling
our family fun time.

Not interesting at all.

00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:48,083
Hurry up, you two!
This place is falling apart!

208
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,750
[TSUYUKI] Most potential
problems are easily avoided

209
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:05,833
if you're always prepared.
I had the building evacuated.

210
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:08,125
I had a feeling that having
you all in one place

211
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:10,208
would result in chaos.

212
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:12,750
You must be C3.

[TSUBAKI laughs] Is that
the best you can do, Brother?

220
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:46,125
I expected much more from you!

221
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:49,083
That's enough. [laughs]

222
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:52,500
Now you're going
to die by my hand.

223
00:13:57,083 --> 00:13:59,958
Is this the same way that
you murdered my teacher?

Kuro! You can't do this!

[SAKUYA] Don't ask me why.
I don't really get it, either.

234
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:34,458
But I felt like this was right.

235
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:36,708
Even though I'm
Tsubaki's subclass,

236
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:38,208
I ended up betraying him.

choose a side.

You're the very best.
Absolutely remarkable.

255
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:28,833
You have more power

256

than your seven big brothers
and sisters combined.

You are his greatest creation.

258

I wonder what they'll be like.

00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:39,750
If they will welcome
me into the family.

[TSUBAKI (FOX)]
I don't know.

You do have the power
to kill them, after all.

I wonder if any of my

Aren't we enough for him?

The words of truth were lost

Why does he keep making Servamps

put me on earth to do.

This is the reason
behind everything.

[MAHIRU]
"Someone." "Someone else."

297

People never want to do
anything themselves.

298
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:34,708
Because it's easier that way.

299
00:19:34,791 --> 00:19:37,208
Because you don't have
to take responsibility.

But, the only reason
the world keeps going

is because someone
does show up to help.

Someone takes a stand.

I wanted to be that
"someone," too.

The "someone" we need
isn't me. Not quite.

00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:59,583
This is a personal problem now.

319
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:03,083
Thank you.
I'll take it from here.

320
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:30,625
[MAHIRU] I'm Mahiru Shirota.
Sixteen years old.

321
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:32,166
I like to keep things simple,

322
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:34,250
and try to keep
life uncomplicated.

323
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:36,166
That's why I picked up a cat.

324
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:37,416
I didn't want to just
leave him there

325
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,041
and end up regretting it later.

326
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:41,583
That would be irritating.

327
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:43,208
[MAHIRU]
Hm?

328
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:46,083
[meows]

329
00:21:56,166 --> 00:21:57,625
[MAHIRU]
Heh.

330
00:21:57,708 --> 00:21:59,291
[gasps]

331
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:01,208
[MAHIRU] Hey, how about I
buy you some of that ramen

332
00:22:01,291 --> 00:22:02,791
you like for dinner tonight.

333
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:04,958
You can share it with
your new feline friend.

334
00:22:05,041 --> 00:22:07,041
[KURO]
What are you grinning about?

335
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:09,708
I can't face you like this.
