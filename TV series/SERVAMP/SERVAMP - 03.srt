1
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,833
[MISONO] I'm absolutely
astounded by your laziness.

2
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:15,166
You haven't even given
your Eve a weapon yet.

3
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:18,083
You live up to your title,
Sloth boy.

4
00:00:18,166 --> 00:00:19,333
Hey, that's right.

5
00:00:19,416 --> 00:00:21,625
Why haven't you given me
some kinda weapon yet?

6
00:00:21,708 --> 00:00:24,458
What's the point in doing
something so troublesome?

7
00:00:24,541 --> 00:00:26,750
Wouldn't you two rather
just look at how cute I am?

8
00:00:26,833 --> 00:00:28,708
[MAHIRU, MISONO]
You're not that cute!

9
00:00:28,791 --> 00:00:30,375
I have a lot to learn.

10
00:00:30,458 --> 00:00:32,041
I barely know anything
about vampires

11
00:00:32,125 --> 00:00:34,916
or what I should
be doing as an Eve.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,166
But I do know that there are
people I want to keep safe.

13
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:39,583
I can't sit back and do nothing

14
00:00:39,666 --> 00:00:41,666
if vampires are
attacking humans.

15
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,000
Do you really think
you need a weapon?

16
00:00:44,083 --> 00:00:45,625
If it gives me the
power to protect others,

17
00:00:45,708 --> 00:00:46,958
yeah, of course!

18
00:00:48,666 --> 00:00:51,541
[KURO]
Then close your eyes.

19
00:00:51,625 --> 00:00:53,500
[MAHIRU] Wait a second...
what's about to happen?

20
00:00:53,583 --> 00:00:55,250
Aren't you gonna
explain things first?

21
00:00:58,666 --> 00:00:59,666
[MAHIRU gasps]

22
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:02,375
[KURO]
Well happy birthday to you.

23
00:02:33,583 --> 00:02:36,291
[KURO]
Happy birthday.

24
00:02:36,375 --> 00:02:38,750
You're inside of Kuro now.

25
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:41,333
Come on, follow me.

26
00:02:41,416 --> 00:02:43,541
You're here for
something, right?

27
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:45,916
Your very own birthday present.

28
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,958
Uh, my birthday's a ways off.

29
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:51,541
Oh, wait. Are you
talking about a weapon?

30
00:02:51,625 --> 00:02:52,541
Who are you?

31
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:54,250
[KURO]
I'm another part of Kuro.

32
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:56,333
I'm in charge of his power.

33
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:58,958
Now it's time for you
to choose your fate.

34
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:00,833
Unwrap whichever one you like.

35
00:03:00,916 --> 00:03:02,166
[MAHIRU]
Out of all those?

36
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:06,291
[KURO]
Yes. Happy birthday, Mahiru.

37
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:09,291
Pick a box and obtain
your very own power.

38
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:12,000
You can't return it
once it's been opened.

39
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:15,958
But you will become a stronger
person who can protect others.

40
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:19,500
[KURO] Choose carefully,
but confidently.

41
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:22,291
The ending will be the same
no matter what you select.

42
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:25,166
Though there are many possible
routes for you to take.

43
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:27,083
What's important is
that your choice reflects

44
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:28,583
who you are inside.

45
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:31,000
Well, in that case, I'll take
the simplest looking one.

46
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:36,500
[LILLY chuckles]

47
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:38,291
[KURO]
Well, you picked a broom.

48
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:40,625
[MISONO] Hmph. A fitting
weapon for a commoner.

49
00:03:41,958 --> 00:03:42,875
[KURO]
Now that I think about it,

50
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:44,416
you tried to attack me
with a mop

51
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,208
the first time you
saw me in this form.

52
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:48,708
What's the deal?

53
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:50,583
Do you have a weird thing
about using cleaning supplies

54
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:51,500
as weapons?

55
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:52,708
No, of course not.

56
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Like a tattoo. What the hell?

57
00:04:01,916 --> 00:04:03,958
[MAHIRU] I don't get how
this thing is a weapon.

58
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:05,916
How will I be able
to fight with it?

59
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:13,000
Now. Fate is finally in motion.

60
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:19,000
[TSUBAKI] You can't put
a plate back on the belt

61
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:20,958
once you've touched it, Berukia.

62
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:22,458
[BERUKIA]
What, seriously?

63
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:25,250
This stupid place
has too many rules.

64
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:28,541
More importantly, Tsu-Tsu,
isn't that joker a little late?

65
00:04:28,625 --> 00:04:30,375
How long are we
gonna have to wait?

66
00:04:32,416 --> 00:04:35,208
Look. Not very long at all.

67
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:36,458
[MALE WORKER 3A]
Hi. Sit anywhe--

68
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:38,708
[CROWD gasping]

69
00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:41,625
[TSUBAKI] Looks like
someone's in a bad mood.

70
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:42,625
[CUSTOMER 3A]
Let's get outta here!

71
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:43,625
[CUSTOMER 3B]
Wait for me!

72
00:04:43,708 --> 00:04:45,541
[SAKUYA]
Tsubaki. You called?

73
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:47,791
Why don't you explain
what you're holding first?

74
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:49,458
[SAKUYA] I'm pretty sure
this guy was following me

75
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:50,875
around earlier.

76
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:53,416
He might be
someone's subclass.

77
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,041
[SAKUYA]
Who knows?

78
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:56,708
Aren't you afraid
someone from school

79
00:04:56,791 --> 00:04:58,541
might see your current state?

80
00:04:58,625 --> 00:05:02,041
It'd be pretty obvious
that you're a vampire.

81
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:04,625
Right? Sakuya?

82
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:07,041
That doesn't matter
to me anymore.

83
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:10,541
They're liars. That's just
something I just can't stand.

84
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:13,916
[MAHIRU growls]
And now I awaken my power!

85
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,541
[yells]

86
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:20,833
[MAHIRU]
Why isn't anything happening?!

87
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:23,083
You need to be able to
pull that weapon out at will

88
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:26,250
before you can start
learning how to fight.

89
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:28,875
Hey, Kuro, is there, like,
a trick to this or what?

90
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:31,541
I'm busy. Don't talk to
me until you can summon it.

91
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:32,958
[MAHIRU]
Ugh!

92
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:35,833
Mahiru, dear, why don't
you try focusing on exactly why

93
00:05:35,916 --> 00:05:37,375
you wanted this power
to begin with.

94
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:39,000
Let that thought guide you.

95
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:40,750
But how will that help?

96
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:42,250
[MISONO]
Your Servamp lacks motivation

97
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:43,875
because you lack resolve.

98
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:45,458
The two are tied together.

99
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:47,208
[MAHIRU] If Kuro acts based
on how I'm feeling,

100
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:48,666
does that mean Lilly
keeps trying to strip

101
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,083
because you secretly want to?!

102
00:05:50,166 --> 00:05:52,875
No, it's because he's
a damn pervert!

103
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:56,500
[MAHIRU] Focus on why
I want power. Okay.

104
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:58,500
Because I want
to protect others.

105
00:05:58,583 --> 00:06:02,083
Everyone I possibly can.
Especially my friends.

106
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:05,708
They've basically been family
to me since I was little.

107
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:07,375
Since I don't have parents,

108
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:09,750
I probably value my
friends more than most.

109
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:16,750
[MAHIRU] Hey, I should
introduce you to them, Misono!

110
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:18,958
There's Ryusei, and Koyuki.

111
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:21,666
But Sakuya has to be the first.
He's my oldest friend!

112
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,458
[MISONO]
You can't.

113
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:25,375
You'd just be getting
your friends involved.

114
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:27,333
And besides, Tsubaki
is the only reason

115
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:29,958
we're connected to each
other in the first place.

116
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:31,291
[MAHIRU]
That's not true.

117
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:33,166
There's no reason
we can't all get along.

118
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:35,500
My old friends
and my new friend.

119
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:37,916
I want to keep everyone
important to me safe--

120
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,375
My friends and family.

121
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:42,791
No matter what we face,
we'll take them down!

122
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:44,208
Right? Kuro?

123
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:47,208
Don't know why you're
asking me; you're in charge.

124
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:48,625
I'll do what you say.

125
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:51,208
Kill or protect whoever
you order me to.

126
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:53,333
That's the job of a Servamp.

127
00:06:53,416 --> 00:06:54,833
Oh, come on, Kuro.

128
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:56,375
Don't you even care a little?

129
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,708
[MAHIRU]
Huh? What was that?

130
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:01,875
Ah, It must have been...

131
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:03,166
[MISONO snoring]

132
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:04,375
[MAHIRU]
Misono?

133
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:06,125
I didn't realize it was so late.

134
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:08,708
He falls asleep
at nine on the dot.

135
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:09,958
[MAHIRU]
Like a little kid?

136
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:12,083
[LILLY] Why don't we
pick this up tomorrow?

137
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:13,416
[MAHIRU]
Yeah, that sounds good.

138
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,250
Thanks for all
the help and advice.

139
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:17,375
Both of you.

140
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:19,208
[LILLY]
Our pleasure.

141
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:22,000
[MAHIRU]
Huh? Sakuya's out again today?

142
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:25,083
I know. It's weird for him to
miss so many classes in a row.

143
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:27,625
[RYUSEI] Maybe he caught some
kinda cold and is stuck in bed.

144
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:29,000
I did call him yesterday,

145
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:31,083
but no one answered
the phone at his place.

146
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:33,208
I wanted him to
try on this uniform.

147
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:34,625
[KOYUKI]
Is that a butler costume?

148
00:07:34,708 --> 00:07:35,958
[RYUSEI]
Whoa, did you make that?

149
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:37,583
You're so crafty, Mahiru.

150
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:39,791
This is gonna kill it
at the festival!

151
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:42,333
Sakuya will flip
out when he sees it.

152
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:43,666
Hopefully.

153
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:46,000
I think later I'll stop
by his house after school.

154
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:49,500
[MALE WORKER 3B]
Thanks! Come back soon!

155
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:51,583
[KURO]
Are there chips?

156
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:53,125
[MAHIRU]
Bad cat!

157
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:55,583
This stuff is for Sakuya.

158
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:57,750
Sakuya's the clown who's
always telling stories

159
00:07:57,833 --> 00:07:59,708
and has weird hair, right?

160
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:02,375
I don't think he'd get along
with that stuck-up brat.

161
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:03,416
[MAHIRU]
"Stuck-up brat"?

162
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,958
You mean Misono?

163
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:07,666
[MAHIRU] Something seemed up
with Sakuya last time I saw him.

164
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,291
I should've spent more
time trying to figure out

165
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:10,541
what was wrong.

166
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:12,083
But since we were kids,
everything's just been

167
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:13,458
a big joke to him.

168
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:15,708
[KURO]
You were childhood friends?

169
00:08:15,791 --> 00:08:18,750
Yeah, we've been friends
since elementary school.

170
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:20,708
Or wait, was it middle school?

171
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:22,208
[KURO]
Oi?

172
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:24,416
[MAHIRU] Sakuya lost both
his parents, just like I did.

173
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,250
[MAHIRU]
How did they die again?

174
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:30,583
I should know this.

175
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:37,083
And where does Sakuya live?
I don't--

176
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:41,708
Why can't I think
of his address?

177
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:45,333
I've been to his place
a million times.

178
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:47,541
When was I there last?

179
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:48,791
What am I saying?

180
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:50,666
He's been my best friend
since we were kids!

181
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:53,333
After all those years...

182
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:54,791
Wait, was he my friend...?

183
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,125
[KURO]
Are you okay?

184
00:08:57,208 --> 00:08:59,333
My head's suddenly killing me.

185
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:00,958
We were inseparable.

186
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:06,000
[MAHIRU]
This "Sakuya"...

187
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:07,333
Who is he again?

188
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:09,291
[SAKUYA]
Hi, Mahiru.

[MAHIRU gasps]

190
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:13,125
[MAHIRU]
Oh. Sakuya.

191
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:15,375
[SAKUYA] Just loitering in the
middle of the sidewalk, huh?

192
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:16,958
What are you doing here?!

193
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:18,916
You haven't been to school or
picked up your phone in days!

194
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,875
I've been worried.

195
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:21,291
[SAKUYA]
So, the thing is...

196
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:23,208
Remember how I said
there were vampires

197
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:25,000
stalking around here at night?

198
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:27,625
Well... I was kind
of attacked by one.

199
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:29,125
Someone rescued me from it.

200
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:32,041
But I've been too scared to
leave my house since then.

201
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:33,750
Now... just how much of
that story do you think

202
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:35,541
I was making up, eh?

203
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:37,750
I knew you were joking.
Have some food.

204
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:39,416
I'm betting you
haven't had dinner.

205
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,958
Y'know, you could really
stand to be more serious.

206
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:43,583
[WOMAN 3A screams]

207
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,625

What's that?

00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:47,666
--[SAKUYA] Mahiru! This way!
--[MAHIRU] Wait, what?

209
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:50,125
Where are you taking me? Sakuya!

210
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:51,291
[SAKUYA]
Just follow me.

211
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:52,916
I'm your best friend, right?

212
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,208
You know what that means.

213
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:55,666
I won't betray you.

214
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,541
That's not what friends do.

215
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:04,500
[MAHIRU]
Where are we?

216
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:06,125
[SAKUYA]
Be honest with me, Mahiru.

217
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:08,333
Do you trust me?

218
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:11,333
If you really trusted me,
then you wouldn't lie to me.

219
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:12,750
Not ever.

220
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:14,500
[MAHIRU]
You're being weird, Sakuya.

221
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:16,458
What are you trying to say? Huh?

222
00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:18,625
[SAKUYA] There's something
I have to know.

223
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:20,791
[SAKUYA] How much of our
relationship is a lie?

224
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:23,791
Or was our entire
friendship a sham?

231
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:40,541
[SAKUYA]
Mahiru. I warned you, didn't I?

232
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:42,291
That there are
vampires around here.

233
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:43,833
[MAHIRU gasps]

234
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:47,875
I told you so, so, so
many times to be careful!

00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:52,750
Mahiru. Your friend...

236

He's Tsubaki's subclass!

Sakuya?

238

Mahiru.

239
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:04,333
Do you ever get the feeling
that the entire world,

240
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:07,750
everything you know,
was created five minutes ago?

241
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,666
You probably
think that's crazy.

242
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:12,125
After all, you have
memories of the past.

243
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:13,666
But what if those
are fake memories

244
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:16,166
that were recently
implanted in your brain?

245
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:19,375
What if I've only been your
best friend for five minutes?

246
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:21,916
Can you prove something
like that is impossible?

247
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,375
Can you prove that
anything actually existed

248
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:26,583
more than five minutes ago?

249
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:27,916
[MAHIRU]
What's he talking about?

250
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,541
[SAKUYA] What did I say
to you when your mom died?

251
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:32,583
Do you remember, Mahiru?

252
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:35,416
Was I... even there?

253
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,833
[MAHIRU]
Hold on.

254
00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:40,208
Why isn't Sakuya in any of
my memories from the past?

255
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:42,458
[SAKUYA]
What do you think?

256
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:45,500
Just how many of your memories
of us are actually lies,

257
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:46,708
my friend?

258
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,291
[MAHIRU]
No, Kuro!

259
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:54,833
[MAHIRU]
He slashed Kuro.

260
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:56,458
But he was going after me.

261
00:11:56,541 --> 00:11:58,458
Sakuya is killing people!

262
00:11:58,541 --> 00:11:59,833
What is going on?

263
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:00,958
You're making it up!

264
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:02,833
You're not actually
a vampire, right?!

265
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:05,708
Oh, you'd love it if that
were a lie, wouldn't you?

266
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:08,291
If vampires didn't exist
and I wasn't one of them,

267
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:11,041
you could chalk this up
as some kinda trick.

268
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:12,916
People always want
to believe the lie

269
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,833
that's most convenient for them.

270
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:19,625
Vampires take advantage of that
and use it to hypnotize humans.

271
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:21,083
[MAHIRU]
I know how it feels.

272
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:23,000
My parents are gone, too.

273
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:25,541
Come over for dinner sometime
so we don't have to eat alone.

274
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:27,250
[SAKUYA]
You were easy to fool.

275
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:30,875
You wanted to connect
with someone so badly.

276
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:34,500
Mahiru, why did you
have to get involved?

277
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:36,250
If you hadn't
picked up that cat...

278
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:39,000
If you hadn't lied to me
and said it was normal...

279
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:41,666
Then I might still be
standing by your side.

280
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,791
Right now.

281
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:46,500
We could've woken tomorrow,
still best friends.

282
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:49,000
Things could have kept
going on like they were.

283
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:53,791
Why does the world fall
apart around you so often?

284
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:55,250
It's not fair.

285
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:57,208
[MAHIRU]
I didn't mean to lie!

286
00:12:57,291 --> 00:12:59,666
I just didn't want my friends to
get wrapped up with vampires!

287
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:02,375
I wanted to keep you safe;
to protect all of you guys!

288
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:03,166
Shut up!

289
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:04,250
You're still lying to me,

290
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:06,166
which means you
really don't trust me!

291
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:07,708
If I was actually
your best friend,

292
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:10,250
then you would've told me
the truth no matter what!

293
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:13,000
Don't you dare say you were
lying to me to keep me safe!

294
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,416
I was!

295
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,083
[SAKUYA] You know...I hate
liars more than anything.

296
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:20,208
Once someone lies to you,
you lose all trust.

297
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:23,666
You can't believe a word
that they say ever again.

298
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,333
Do you know how this feels?

299
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:28,625
It's like my entire
body's being torn apart.

300
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:31,833
That's what happens when your
best friend lies to your face.

301
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:34,125
And that's not all!
I'm not stupid.

302
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:36,583
I knew the words coming out
of your mouth were lies!

303
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:38,833
But I just stood there
pretending it was okay.

304
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:40,250
I didn't say anything,

305
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:43,208
which means you made a liar
out of me, too, Mahiru!

00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:04,250
Drinking your blood isn't
gonna help anything.

313
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:05,583
Not when you're like this.

314
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:07,083
[MAHIRU]
What?

315
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:09,083
[KURO] That stuck-up brat
explained it to you, didn't he?

316
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:10,541
We're linked.

317
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:12,875
The reason I'm so lazy is
because you lack certainty.

318
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:14,750
A Servamp is powered
by the resolve

319
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:16,666
flowing through
the veins of its Eve.

320
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:19,375
That means my power is
only equal to the strength

321
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:20,625
of your will.

322

[KURO] You don't have
any resolve right now.

323
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:24,875
I can't tell if you want
me to protect your friend

324
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:26,708
or to kill him.

[MAHIRU]
What am I thinking?

326
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:30,291
What am I trying to do?

00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:31,541
Who do I protect?

What the...?

[MAHIRU]
Misono?

331
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:39,958
Stand back, Mahiru Shirota.
I'll take care of this.

332
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:41,208
Hold on a second!

333
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:43,875
You can't!
That's my friend Sakuya!

334
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:45,083
Right.

335

I'm his very best friend
in the whole world.

336
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:49,708
So what are you going
to do with me, huh?

337
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:51,916
This guy is one
of your friends?

338
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:52,916
What a pity.

339
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,625
We won't get along, vampire.

340
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:56,333
[SAKUYA chuckles]

341
00:14:56,416 --> 00:14:59,375
I'm not very good at fighting,
but I'll do my best.

If it brings you pleasure.

[BERUKIA growls]

344
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:08,500
Not a very good plan.

345
00:15:08,583 --> 00:15:11,166
Do you really think you
can take me down alone?

346
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:14,625
That's pretty damn cocky of you,
you rich little punk.

347
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:17,708
Tell me when and why you first
got close to Mahiru Shirota.

348
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:19,208
What were your motives?

349
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:23,750
Huh? You're talking like some
kind of jealous boyfriend

350
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:24,833
who's been cheated on.

351
00:15:24,916 --> 00:15:26,458
Why do you care so
much about Mahiru?

352
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:28,166
Didn't you just meet
him like, yesterday?

353
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:29,708
It doesn't matter when we met.

354
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,750
It matters what he said.

355
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:33,833
Shirota called me his friend!

356
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:35,458
[SAKUYA]
His friend, huh?

357
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:38,250
You child! You really believed
such an obvious con?

358
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:40,125
There's not a lie in the
world that's more overused

359
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:42,291
than friendship!
You're stupider than I thought.

360
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:44,000
You can't even tell when
someone is just saying

361
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:45,833
what you want
to hear to be polite!

What are you doing now?

363
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:55,041
What's a kid like you
gonna do against me?

364
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:56,833
This is so easy;
you're a lonely Eve

who's about to be
knocked off the board.

366
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:01,791
Separating from your Servamp
was an idiotic mistake.

367
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:03,458
Ah. Some applause, please.

368
00:16:03,541 --> 00:16:06,333
Prepare to be amazed
by the duke of skewering!

Berukia...
and his magic murder box!

370
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:11,666
No one leaves the box alive!

371

Now, now, now, let's impale the
boy with the stupid cowlick!

372
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:20,000
Lilly only left my side because
he had a good reason to.

373
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:21,750
Watch closely, Shirota.

374
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:24,041
This is one way
I can use my power.

375
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,958
If an enemy target comes
in between Lilly and I,

376

this weapon activates.

Good night. And sweet dreams.

is this thing?

You're kidding me!

Nighty night, now.

[MAHIRU] It looked like you
chopped his head off.

[LILLY] My power only
destroys the mind, not the body.

To be honest with you,
I'm out of practice,

387
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:05,666
but it's good to know that
we can still put up a fight.

388
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:08,166
Misono really wanted to
show off for you, Mahiru.

[MISONO]
Be quiet, Lilly!

390
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:12,041
It's unfortunate.

391
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:13,791
Shirota told me
how excited he was

392
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:15,250
to introduce his friends to me.

393
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:16,916
He wanted you to be first.

394
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,833
He really wanted
to introduce us?

395
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:21,333
I see.

396
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:23,250
I wish we could
have stayed friends.

Even if it was only for
just another week or two.

I was actually pretty pumped
to go to the school festival

399

that was coming up.

turned out differently.

might even have been friends.

him distract you.

Mahiru.

00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:45,958
I wonder what your new
friend's intentions are.

00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:48,583
Sounds to me like
he wants us to fight.

wrong with your leg.

[LILLY gasps]
Misono!

[SAKUYA] So just how much
of what I said earlier

417
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:16,041
do you think was a lie, Mahiru?

418
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:18,375
Does it mean I'm a liar
if I failed to mention

419
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:19,458
we're not alone?

So there's someone else here--

pulling the strings.

It's so difficult to impersonate
the strange way Berukia talks.

It's a problem.

Sakuya! Why are you
doing this to us?

What the heck happened to you?

I thought maybe the three
of us could all be friends.

Shirota...

430
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:45,000
Did I do something out of line?

431
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:48,125
I just wanted to
protect my new friend.

It wasn't out of line.

You were only trying
to do something noble.

You have no idea, Mahiru.

No idea how your supposed best
friend felt this whole time.

way home from school...

The more fun I had
with you guys,

[MAHIRU]
Sakuya...

441
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:10,041
It'd get so bad that I'd
think about killing someone.

442
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:12,250
I guess it's just
to be expected.

443
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:14,500
That's just the way I'm wired.

444
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:18,500
Vampires exist to
hurt people. Humans.

[MAHIRU]
No...

446

[grunts]

But it's true, Mahiru.

449
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:28,041
Honestly, the guilt feels
pretty damn good, too.

450
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,916
It's all part of
being a vampire.

Now, listen.

453
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:35,333
If you're going to try and kill
me, be serious about it.

454
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:38,541
Otherwise, I might attack
your new friend again.

455
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:40,625
And this time he'll die.

456
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:42,125
You're a liar.

457
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:44,833
Would you really do to him
what he did to you?

458
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:46,458
You won't betray him.

Keep quiet, Mahiru.

You can't fight him

for us to run now.

00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,375
You haven't done anything
you'll regret yet.

470
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:14,458
You can still walk away from
here with a clear conscience.

471
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:17,166
I can't just sit back
and do nothing!

472
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,208
You're not listening, Mahiru.

473
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:23,250
What I mean is that you're
unsure of yourself right now.

474
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:25,541
Sakuya!

475
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:30,500
Good. You're doing the
right thing, Mahiru.

476
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:34,583
Liars all deserve to be killed.

477
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:37,333
It's raining even
though the moon is out.

478
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:40,916
But I thought you weren't going
to be joining us here today.

479
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,875
And why not, Otogiri?

480
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:44,375
I want in on the fun.

481
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:46,125
It's a problem.

482
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:48,500
So, Mahiru Shirota.

483
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:51,291
I want to see the true
shape of your despair.

484
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:54,208
It would be interesting
if you became the key.

485
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:55,458
[KURO]
Please.

486
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:58,333
Don't lose sight of yourself.
Don't be swayed.

487
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:02,666
[MAHIRU]
I hit him. I hit Sakuya.

488
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:08,208
[KURO]
Don't get swallowed.

489
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:10,375
[MAHIRU] I don't feel like
I'm the one swinging.

490
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:13,291
It's like I'm being
swung around.

491
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:14,708
[SAKUYA]
It won't stop bleeding.

492
00:21:14,791 --> 00:21:16,333
Is it because of that broom?

493
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:17,375
What do ya know?

494
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:19,750
Maybe you will
be able to kill me.

495
00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:21,083
[MAHIRU]
Wait a second.

496
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:22,750
What does he mean by that?

497
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:25,125
I'm not gonna kill Sakuya!

498
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:28,000
[KURO]
No. Don't go down that path.

499
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:29,916
You can't, Mahiru.

500
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,916
You won't be able to stay human!

501
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,583
[MAHIRU]
I don't want to kill anyone.

502
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:36,541
Especially not him.

503
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:38,000
We were friends.

504
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:40,250
This isn't the power
that I asked for!

505
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:44,458
[MAHIRU]
I can't do this.

506
00:21:44,541 --> 00:21:46,125
I wanted to protect people!

507
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:49,291
[SAKUYA]
Hey, Mahiru?

508
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:53,250
You won't believe this, but I
actually had a secret plan.

509
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:55,583
It was for me,
someone who doesn't age,

510
00:21:55,666 --> 00:21:57,166
to be best friends with you guys

511
00:21:57,250 --> 00:22:00,416
and have the best three years of
high school anyone's ever had.

512
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,500
[KURO]
Mahiru!

513
00:22:03,791 --> 00:22:05,833
[SAKUYA] And then quietly
disappear so you could

514
00:22:05,916 --> 00:22:08,125
continue on with your lives.

515
00:22:08,208 --> 00:22:11,750
That was my big hope
for a happy future.

516
00:23:42,333 --> 00:23:44,166
[LILLY] I'll bring you
pleasure next week.

517
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:45,166
See you then.

518
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:47,000
[MISONO]
Put your clothes back on!
