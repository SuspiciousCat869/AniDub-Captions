00:00:09,041 --> 00:00:10,166
[KURO]
Help... Help...

2
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:12,041
I'm drowning... I'm drowning...

3
00:00:13,291 --> 00:00:14,917
What should we do, Kuro?

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,291
We're being overwhelmed
by Mahiru's emotions.

5
00:00:18,375 --> 00:00:20,667
Fear. Regret. Rejection.

6
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:22,667
If Mahiru hadn't taken you home,

7
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:25,208
he would never have felt
these things so strongly.

8
00:00:27,333 --> 00:00:31,291
Wherever you go, you always
bring misfortune with you.

9
00:00:31,375 --> 00:00:32,792
What a pain.

10
00:02:12,625 --> 00:02:13,750
Kuro! Ah...

11
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:17,875
What are you...?

12
00:02:34,417 --> 00:02:36,500
[retching]

13
00:02:36,583 --> 00:02:37,583
[MAHIRU]
Kuro?

14
00:02:39,709 --> 00:02:42,291
[OTOGIRI]
This is unexpected.

15
00:02:42,375 --> 00:02:45,041
A surprise. That's a problem.

16
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:48,709
What should we do now, Tsubaki?

17
00:02:48,792 --> 00:02:50,750
I guess he changed his mind.

18
00:02:50,834 --> 00:02:52,166
That's a problem.

19
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:54,458
[growling]

20
00:02:54,542 --> 00:02:57,291
Kuro, what the hell
is going on?!

21
00:02:57,375 --> 00:02:58,625
What is that thing?!

22
00:02:59,709 --> 00:03:02,083
[MAHIRU] This is bad.
I feel like... I'm drowning.

23
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:04,166
[SAKUYA]
Mahiru!

24
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:04,959
Here!

25
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:06,083
[MAHIRU]
Sakuya!

26
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:07,500
[OTOGIRI, BERUKIA]
Bad form.

27
00:03:07,583 --> 00:03:09,000
You're trying to
save your enemy.

28
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:10,208
And that's a problem.

29
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:12,417
Shut up! C'mon, Mahiru.

30
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,792
You have to order your
Servamp to kill me now!

31
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:17,500
It's what I wanted!

32
00:03:17,583 --> 00:03:20,000
It's the reason I lied
to you and brought you here!

33
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,208
[MAHIRU]
Kuro?

34
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:30,417
[MIKUNI]
Go on, Jeje. Get on with it.

35
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:44,667
[SAKUYA]
Who's that?

36
00:03:51,542 --> 00:03:53,834
[OTOGIRI] Looks like we're
outnumbered. That's a problem.

37
00:03:53,917 --> 00:03:54,875
Time to go home.

38
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,291
Yeah, okay.

39
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:59,000
Thanks for saving me,
but you could've been gentler.

40
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:00,041
Sakuya!

41
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:01,750
So you don't really
want to kill me?

42
00:04:01,834 --> 00:04:02,917
It was a trick?

43
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:11,166
[MAHIRU]
Where'd he go?

44
00:04:13,917 --> 00:04:15,583
[MAHIRU]
What the crap?!

45
00:04:15,667 --> 00:04:17,458
Is the arrogant brat dead?

46
00:04:17,542 --> 00:04:18,583
Hi, Doudou.

47
00:04:18,667 --> 00:04:21,083
Misono's... injured.

48
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:22,125
[LILLY]
Thank goodness you're here.

49
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:23,417
He needs a doctor.

50
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,917
Misono?

51
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,333
Are you okay, Mahiru?

52
00:04:26,417 --> 00:04:28,750
Yeah, I'm fine;
just take care of him.

53
00:04:28,834 --> 00:04:30,083
Don't worry 'bout me.

54
00:04:35,417 --> 00:04:38,250
He's hurt. And it's my fault.

55
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:40,750
[MIKUNI] There's no reason
for you to feel responsible

56
00:04:40,834 --> 00:04:42,709
for what happened.

57
00:04:42,792 --> 00:04:44,750
I'll say one thing:
you have excellent timing.

58
00:04:44,834 --> 00:04:46,417
Well, you-know-who
contacted me,

59
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,125
so I knew exactly where to go.

60
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:52,083
Of course. I see.

61
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:54,208
[MIKUNI] A person must
take full responsibility

62
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:55,709
for their own actions.

63
00:04:55,792 --> 00:04:58,625
No matter what.

64
00:04:58,709 --> 00:05:01,375
I'm sure Misono knew exactly
what he was getting into

65
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:03,166
whenever he chose
to get involved.

66
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:04,709
Nice to meet you, young man.

67
00:05:04,792 --> 00:05:06,834
Beside me is the
Servamp of Envy.

68
00:05:06,917 --> 00:05:08,959
His name's Doubt Doubt.

69
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:11,375
You might've guessed--
I'm his Eve.

70
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:15,166
Just a simple antique dealer
traveling across the world.

71
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,125
Won't you please
hold me, Mahiru?

72
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:19,667
Uh, wait, how do you
know my name?

73
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:22,375
Huh? No, don't be afraid, Abel.

74
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:23,375
It's all right.

75
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:25,208
This young man is not our enemy.

76
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:26,542
You're safe.

77
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:29,333
Huh? You think children
nowadays are too violent?

78
00:05:29,417 --> 00:05:30,542
[laughs]

79
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:33,375
Don't worry so much,
Abel, my darling.

80
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,709
[MAHIRU] Why is everyone
I meet a weirdo?

81
00:05:35,792 --> 00:05:37,208
[MIKUNI]
What's with that look?!

82
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:39,291
Don't stare at her with
such lust in your eyes.

83
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:40,834
Pervert! She'd just a doll!

84
00:05:40,917 --> 00:05:42,291
What are you talking about?!

85
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:43,000
Whoa!

86
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:44,291
[JEJE]
Enough talk.

87
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:46,542
Time for you to
keep your promise.

88
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:48,250
[MIKUNI]
Huh? And what was that?

89
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:50,333
[JEJE] You promised that
if I followed your orders,

90
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:52,750
you'd let me drink your blood.

91
00:05:52,834 --> 00:05:56,041
Huh? Sorry, I can't hear you!

92
00:05:56,792 --> 00:05:57,750
[MIKUNI laughs]

93
00:05:57,834 --> 00:06:00,000
Jeje, stop,
you're being mean!

94
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:05,875
Sorry we had to take
him down so brutally.

95
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:10,166
I wish we could have
destroyed Tsubaki's subclass

96
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,875
before he managed to escape.

97
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:15,208
You heard him;
that's what he wanted.

98
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:17,166
Well, at least now you know
you don't have the stomach

99
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,458
for something like that.

100
00:06:18,542 --> 00:06:20,542
Though, you did come close.

101
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:22,542
I imagine it would
be pretty traumatizing

102
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:26,208
to kill your best friend,
even if he was asking you to.

103
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:28,083
Y'know, Mahiru...

104
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:30,917
I can teach you how to
nullify a Servamp contract

105
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,083
if you're interested.

106
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:34,542
You can?

107
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:37,375
I mean, it's none
of my business, I know.

108
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:40,583
But I figured you might be
regretting your choices.

109
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:43,750
You never thought things
would turn out this way, right?

110
00:06:43,834 --> 00:06:46,041
Contracts like this
can be scary.

111
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:49,291
If you lose control and
start to fear your power,

112
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:54,583
then your Servamp won't
hesitate to gobble you up whole.

113
00:06:54,667 --> 00:06:56,750
So just let me know
if you're interested.

114
00:06:56,834 --> 00:06:59,583
I can help you go back to
being a normal student.

115
00:06:59,667 --> 00:07:00,542
[MAHIRU]
Wait!

116
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:02,208
Just who are you?

117
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:04,709
What were you even doing here?

118
00:07:04,792 --> 00:07:05,750
I thought I told you.

119
00:07:05,834 --> 00:07:07,667
I'm just a traveling
antique dealer!

120
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:10,208
Isn't that right, Abel?

121
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:14,000
[laughing]

122
00:07:18,792 --> 00:07:20,041
Mahiru.

123
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:22,166
Shouldn't you be getting
ready for school?

124
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:28,166
[MAHIRU]
How are your injuries doing?

125
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:30,041
I'm all healed up now.

126
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:32,625
I am a vampire, after all.

127
00:07:32,709 --> 00:07:33,667
[MAHIRU]
Yup.

128
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:36,542
You are, in fact, a vampire.

129
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:38,333
Do you regret taking me in?

130
00:07:38,417 --> 00:07:41,792
Is that what this is all about?

131
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:43,917
[MAHIRU]
Shut up.

132
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,458
[KURO]
Of course you do.

133
00:07:47,417 --> 00:07:49,959
[MAHIRU]
I don't regret taking you in.

134
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:54,041
I just don't know what
I'm supposed to do now.

135
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:56,500
What's the point of this power?

136
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:59,333
I thought that if I had it,
I could help others.

137
00:07:59,417 --> 00:08:01,834
But so far, it seems like the
only thing I've managed to do

138
00:08:01,917 --> 00:08:03,208
is hurt people.

139
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:05,458
[LITTLE GIRL 4A]
That was really yummy!

140
00:08:05,542 --> 00:08:06,667
[MOM 4A]
C'mon, dear.

141
00:08:12,917 --> 00:08:14,000
[WORKER 3A]
Have a seat!

142
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,417
Who do we have here?

143
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,500
What an unexpected surprise.

144
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:27,166
Do you come here often?
Big sushi fan?

145
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:29,750
Don't look so glum.

146
00:08:29,834 --> 00:08:32,667
Here, can I interest you
in a little salmon roe?

147
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,375
It's eggcellent.

148
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:37,291
[laughing]

149
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:39,333
[sighs]
Not interesting at all.

150
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:46,583
Sakuya... How did he
become your subclass?

151
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:49,375
Poor boy.

152
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:52,417
You really are clueless,
aren't you?

153
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,166
But if you want to know,

154
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:57,834
I'll tell you the whole
boring story, I guess.

155
00:08:57,917 --> 00:09:00,333
[TSUBAKI]
Sakuya was the child of liars--

156
00:09:00,417 --> 00:09:02,834
born into a town of liars.

157
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:05,250
The first person to tell
him a lie was none other

158
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:07,333
than his big sister.

159
00:09:07,417 --> 00:09:08,875
Sakuya...

160
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:11,750
Father's coming home tonight,
so do me a favor, okay?

161
00:09:11,834 --> 00:09:13,125
Promise me that
whatever happens,

162
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:15,250
you won't come out of your room.

163
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:16,750
[SAKUYA]
What about you, Sis?

164
00:09:16,834 --> 00:09:19,834
[SAKUYA'S SISTER] Don't worry
about me. I'll be fine.

165
00:09:19,917 --> 00:09:21,458
Everything will work out.

166
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,750
[SAKUYA'S SISTER]
How much do you get if I die?

167
00:09:24,834 --> 00:09:25,834
Enough?

168
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,875
Make sure Sakuya's okay.

169
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:31,917
[SAKUYA'S FATHER] Sure thing.
I'll look out for him.

170
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
[SAKUYA gasps]

171
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,625
[TSUBAKI] Sakuya's father told
him to tell the police

172
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:46,375
that his sister
fell off the balcony

173
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:48,583
while they were playing around.

174
00:09:48,667 --> 00:09:51,542
That it was all just
a tragic accident.

175
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:53,583
He said that if he didn't
go along with the story,

176
00:09:53,667 --> 00:09:55,625
the same thing
would happen to him.

177
00:09:55,709 --> 00:09:57,166
"You don't want
your sister's death

178
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,333
to have been in vain,
right?" he asked.

179
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,709
And so Sakuya lied
for the very first time.

180
00:10:04,792 --> 00:10:08,000
And his family received a
huge life insurance payout.

181
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,625
The neighbors all knew
something bad was going on

182
00:10:11,709 --> 00:10:14,750
in Sakuya's home,
but no one said anything.

183
00:10:14,834 --> 00:10:16,750
They didn't want
to get involved.

184
00:10:16,834 --> 00:10:18,291
They lied.

185
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:21,166
In a way, they helped
cover up his sister's death.

186
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:23,250
It was really no
surprise to anyone

187
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:26,166
when 6 years later,
Sakuya found himself doomed

188
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,667
to follow the same
path as his sister.

189
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,500
I've come to help.

190
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:40,417
[TSUBAKI] Here's something
you may not know.

191
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,792
Subclasses are created
when a dying human

192
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:44,583
drinks a Servamp's blood.

193
00:10:44,667 --> 00:10:48,000
And subclasses have to obey
the Servamps who made them.

194
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:50,333
They make such good servants.

195
00:10:50,417 --> 00:10:51,458
[laughs]

196
00:10:51,542 --> 00:10:53,125
I can tell by the
look on your face

197
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:55,458
you didn't know any of this.

198
00:10:55,542 --> 00:10:57,208
Some best friend you are.

199
00:10:57,291 --> 00:11:03,250
[laughing]

200
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:06,625
[TSUBAKI sighs]
Not interesting at all.

201
00:11:06,709 --> 00:11:07,875
Check please, sir!

202
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:13,458
[TSUBAKI] I'll leave before Big
Brother gets scary again.

203
00:11:13,542 --> 00:11:15,375
He's in your backpack, right?

204
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:18,041
I could feel his murderous
aura from here.

205
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:24,375
Unfortunately, I just don't
much feel like playing today.

206
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:25,417
Ta-ta.

207
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:29,333
[MAHIRU]
Tsubaki, wait!

208
00:11:29,417 --> 00:11:31,000
Where's Sakuya?

209
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:33,542
You have to... give him back.

210
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:36,583
Why can't I move?

211
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:41,542
It's my fault.

212
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:43,667
If only I'd tried to
understand Sakuya better,

213
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:46,041
I should have been
honest with him.

214
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:48,792
I was just trying to
keep him out of all this.

215
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:51,125
That's why I lied.

216
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:56,208
[TORU]
So you got into a fight?

217
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:59,500
Go on. You can choose whatever
you want off the belt.

218
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:03,500
[MAHIRU]
You aren't mad at me?

219
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:05,000
[TORU]
You know, Mahiru,

220
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:07,709
being a good friend to someone
is actually pretty simple.

221
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:10,834
You just need
the resolve to say,

222
00:12:10,917 --> 00:12:13,291
"I am your friend
no matter what."

223
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:15,166
And, "I believe in you."

224
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:16,500
"I care."

225
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:17,667
That's all.

226
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:23,917
[TORU]
It's okay to make mistakes.

227
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I've made plenty of them.

228
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:28,166
But you shouldn't
have any regrets.

229
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:31,500
You also have to learn
what's good for you

230
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:33,208
isn't always good for others.

231
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:36,667
People are different.
It's just the way it is.

232
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:39,667
But we can still lean on
each other in times of need.

233
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,792
That's what makes humanity work.

234
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:43,959
We get through life together.

235
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:48,250
We look out for one another.

236
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:49,500
[MAHIRU]
I'm sorry, Sakuya.

237
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:50,959
After all that time together,

238
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:53,709
now I can hardly remember
what your smile looked like.

239
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:56,375
[MAHIRU]
Yeah. I understand.

240
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:00,500
You don't need
to apologize, Uncle.

241
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:02,625
I'm sure it'll be fine.

242
00:13:02,709 --> 00:13:03,792
Talk to you later.

243
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:07,917
[SAKUYA] S'up, Mahiru!
Was that your uncle?

244
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,667
Is he not coming to the
parent-teacher meeting?

245
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,750
[MAHIRU]
No.

246
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:15,625
[SAKUYA] Well, I just told the
teacher that I'd be coming alone

247
00:13:15,709 --> 00:13:17,750
because I don't
have any parents.

248
00:13:17,834 --> 00:13:21,166
My grades are awesome, so it's
kind of a waste of time anyways.

249
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:23,166
I'd rather be hanging
out or something.

250
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:24,083
[MAHIRU]
Sure, you would.

251
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:26,750
[SAKUYA]
Aw, don't look so sad!

252
00:13:26,834 --> 00:13:28,875
Wait, I've got a brilliant idea.

253
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,291
Why don't we have our meeting
with the teacher together?

254
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:32,875
[MAHIRU]
I don't think they'll let us.

255
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:35,792
[SAKUYA] Ha. You do realize none
of this really matters, right?

256
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:38,166
Come on, let's see
a smile, Mahiru!

257
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,083
Cheer up.

258
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:41,542
I'm here for you.

259
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:47,166
--[MAHIRU yells]
--[TSUYUKI] Ouch.

260
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:49,792
Ah! Ow... Sorry 'bout that.

261
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:51,083
Are you okay?

262
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:52,875
[TSUYUKI]
Yeah, I'm perfectly fine.

263
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:54,792
Most potential problems
are easily avoided

264
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:56,417
if you're always prepared.

265
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:06,000
[KOYUKI]
Oh! Mahiru's here.

266
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:07,375
[RYUSEI]
Thank goodness!

267
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:09,250
We were wondering what
we'd do if you weren't here

268
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:10,667
to help with the festival.

269
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:11,583
Where's Sakuya?

270
00:14:11,667 --> 00:14:14,417
[KOYUKI]
Hm? Sakuya?

271
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,500
[MAHIRU]
No way.

272
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:19,083
Are everyone's
memories gone now?

273
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:20,583
Don't you remember him?

274
00:14:20,667 --> 00:14:25,083
Huh? Of course. How could
we forget a dude like that?

275
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:27,834
But Sakuya transferred
schools. Last week.

276
00:14:27,917 --> 00:14:30,792
[KOYUKI] It's too bad he had to
leave right before the festival.

277
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:33,000
He was so excited about it.

278
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:34,458
But now he'll miss it.

279
00:14:34,542 --> 00:14:36,667
[BOY STUDENT 4A] I dunno,
maybe he'll show up anyway.

280
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:37,959
I'll text him after school.

281
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:39,458
[MAHIRU]
He left his name behind.

282
00:14:39,542 --> 00:14:41,375
Part of their memories.
But why?

283
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:44,542
[RYUSEI] It's, uh... kinda weird
thinking about Sakuya.

284
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:45,917
For me, at least.

285
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,583
It's like there's
a blank space.

286
00:14:47,667 --> 00:14:49,750
I mean, I can remember
what he was like.

287
00:14:49,834 --> 00:14:52,291
But I just can't
picture his face.

288
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:55,291
There's just nothing there
when I try to remember.

289
00:14:58,208 --> 00:15:02,041
[MAHIRU]
Sakuya, is this what you wanted?

290
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:03,208
You're a coward.

291
00:15:04,792 --> 00:15:06,375
[RYUSEI] Do you think
I'll recognize him

292
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:07,625
if he shows tomorrow?

293
00:15:07,709 --> 00:15:10,750
Don't worry. I definitely will.

294
00:15:16,667 --> 00:15:17,542
[LILLY]
Misono.

295
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,834
Looks like Mahiru texted you.

296
00:15:19,917 --> 00:15:22,458
He says he wants
to come and visit.

297
00:15:22,542 --> 00:15:24,041
[MISONO]
Tell him I'm dead.

298
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:26,959
[LILLY] How about I send him a
map to the hospital instead, hm?

299
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:29,125
--[laughing]
--[MISONO] You bastard! Ugh!

300
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:32,208
You're my Servamp, Lilly.
You can't just ignore my orders!

301
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:34,542
And since when do you
know how to work my phone?

302
00:15:41,667 --> 00:15:43,667
[MISONO]
My injuries weren't that bad.

303
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:46,125
Tell him I'll get
back to him later.

304
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:47,583
[LILLY]
Consider it done.

305
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:52,667
[MISONO]
I made such a big entrance.

306
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,709
But I couldn't
protect my friend.

307
00:15:54,792 --> 00:15:56,667
How am I supposed
to face him now?

308
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:02,417
[MISONO] Lilly, I...
I want to become stronger.

309
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,959
[KOYUKI]
Hi everyone!

310
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:11,667
We're with class 1-6!

311
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,041
Please stop by our café,

312
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:15,542
and I guarantee that
you'll have a good time!

313
00:16:38,542 --> 00:16:41,375
[SAKUYA]
Ow! What the heck?

314
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:43,625
[MAHIRU]
Sakuya!

315
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:47,834
[MAHIRU] Come back here!
We gotta talk!

316
00:16:47,917 --> 00:16:49,041
Talk?!

317
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:51,208
What? Are you out
of your damn mind?

318
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:54,834
I tried to kill you.

319
00:16:54,917 --> 00:16:56,875
And your friend, too.
Did you forget?

320
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:58,333
You are such a liar!

321
00:16:58,417 --> 00:17:01,083
You reached your hand out to me!

322
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:02,917
You were trying to save my life!

323
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,792
Plus, I heard that Misono's
injuries weren't that bad!

324
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:08,291
But you should still
apologize to him!

325
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:10,000
[SAKUYA]
Like hell I will!

326
00:17:11,417 --> 00:17:14,000
Listen.
I'm your enemy now, Mahiru.

327
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:15,333
[MAHIRU]
No, you're not!

328
00:17:16,667 --> 00:17:18,083
You're my friend.

329
00:17:21,792 --> 00:17:23,458
[SAKUYA]
How can you still say that?

330
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:25,917
We were never really
childhood friends!

331
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,875
Those are just fake
memories I gave you!

332
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:38,333
[SAKUYA] We've only known
each other for one year.

333
00:17:38,417 --> 00:17:39,667
That's all.

334
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:42,375
And I was lying to you
the whole time.

335
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:44,125
Right to your face.

336
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:45,583
Don't you get it?

337
00:17:46,709 --> 00:17:49,083
Even if that is the truth,

338
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:51,500
it was a fun year!

339
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:52,959
Just come back!

340
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:57,458
[SAKUYA]
No. I can't be with you.

341
00:17:57,542 --> 00:18:00,250
Not anymore.

342
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:02,000
I am not human.

343
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:08,041
I'm different from
everyone else at school.

344
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:10,875
So... different.

345
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:19,417
[yell]

346
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,750
Fly!

347
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:26,500
I don't care if you're a
human or a vampire, okay?

348
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:28,250
This may all be new to me.

349
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:31,417
But I've still got the power to
grab your outstretched hand.

350
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,750
[BOTH yelling]

351
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,750
[SAKUYA]
So, the weapon lets you fly.

352
00:18:43,834 --> 00:18:44,792
That's cool.

353
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:46,500
[MAHIRU]
This was kinda my first try.

354
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:51,542
But I figured, a black cat
and a broom, right?

355
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:53,542
It seemed pretty obvious.

356
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:55,875
It had to work.

357
00:18:55,959 --> 00:18:58,250
Seriously, Mahiru?

358
00:18:58,333 --> 00:18:59,667
[chuckles]

359
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,083
You're a mess.

360
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:05,333
[laughing]

361
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:13,875
[crying]

362
00:19:13,959 --> 00:19:18,166
[SAKUYA] I... wanted more
chances to laugh like this.

363
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:22,125
But I think this is it,
you know?

364
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:26,041
When I met Tsubaki,
I was in such a bad place.

365
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,417
I lied to them.

366
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,792
And that means
I helped kill my sister.

367
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:36,959
If only I'd been the
one who died instead.

368
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:39,333
[TSUBAKI] You did
absolutely nothing wrong.

369
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:44,041
Don't think that way;
it's not your fault.

370
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:49,125
[TSUBAKI] You've been
through so much pain.

371
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:51,500
[SAKUYA crying]

372
00:19:51,583 --> 00:19:53,041
[TSUBAKI]
It's all right.

373
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:54,667
When this is all over,

374
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:57,375
I promise I'll be there
to lend a hand.

375
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:05,041
[SAKUYA]
He didn't lie to me.

376
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:07,667
He kept his word.

377
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,458
I have come to help.

378
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:11,625
[SAKUYA]
Tsubaki was the only one.

379
00:20:11,709 --> 00:20:14,667
He reached out his hand to me.

380
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:17,959
Tsubaki saved me.

381
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:20,750
[MAHIRU] It's almost like...
they're the same.

382
00:20:20,834 --> 00:20:22,083
[SAKUYA]
I can't betray him.

383
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:26,375
If he tells me to kill,
then I'll just have to--

384
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:27,500
[MAHIRU]
No!

385
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:30,291
I'll stop Tsubaki.

386
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:31,667
Thinking simply...

387
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:35,083
Kuro and I are the only ones
who can take him down.

388
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:38,041
You don't just have
Tsubaki right now, Sakuya.

389
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:40,333
You've got me and
everyone else, too!

390
00:20:40,417 --> 00:20:42,667
You aren't alone!

391
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,709
I'm here for you.

392
00:20:44,792 --> 00:20:48,542
[SAKUYA] Mahiru, please
don't lie to me anymore.

393
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:49,709
[MAHIRU]
I won't!

394
00:20:49,792 --> 00:20:51,208
[SAKUYA] I really do
want to believe you.

395
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:55,667
Thank you.

396
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:58,750
What you've said--
I needed that.

397
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:05,208
But I still can't
be with you right now.

398
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:06,834
I hope you understand.

399
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:12,041
I'll fix this!

400
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:19,000
[MAHIRU]
Kuro...

401
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:21,291
I want to stop Tsubaki.

402
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:23,417
This time, I'm serious.

403
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:26,291
To do that, well,

404
00:21:26,375 --> 00:21:28,542
you're gonna have to
help me get stronger.

405
00:21:31,917 --> 00:21:33,333
[KURO]
You're such a pain.

406
00:21:35,959 --> 00:21:37,917
[SAKUYA]
I'm a child of liars

407
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,250
who was born in
a town of liars.

408
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:42,000
This is my truth.

409
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:43,125
A year ago,

410
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:45,083
I snuck into a
random middle school.

411
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:48,041
Just to kill a little time.

412
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:50,583
But when I saw that simple,
outstretched hand,

413
00:21:50,667 --> 00:21:52,041
something happened.

414
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:57,041
I thought, "Hey, I want
to get to know this guy."

415
00:22:01,542 --> 00:22:02,750
Mahiru.

416
00:22:02,834 --> 00:22:05,542
Thanks for finding me that day.

417
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:09,625
Thanks for reaching out
your hand to me, my friend.

418
00:23:43,625 --> 00:23:45,625
[SAKUYA] Now, I wonder how
much of the next episode

419
00:23:45,709 --> 00:23:46,959
is a lie, hmm?

420
00:23:47,041 --> 00:23:48,000
[TSUBAKI]
Not interesting at all.
