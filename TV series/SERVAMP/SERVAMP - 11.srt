1
00:00:13,041 --> 00:00:15,166
[LAWLESS] Whoever this
walking corpse is...

2
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:18,000
If he's Licht's enemy,
then he's my enemy, too.

3
00:00:18,083 --> 00:00:19,500
Can it, hedgehog.

4
00:00:19,583 --> 00:00:21,250
The name is Higan.

5
00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:23,750
I'm one of Tsubaki's
loyal friends, which means

6
00:00:23,833 --> 00:00:26,333
that you and I aren't gonna
get along very well.

7
00:00:26,416 --> 00:00:27,625
Nice to meet you.

8
00:00:27,708 --> 00:00:29,250
You stay out of my way.

9
00:00:29,333 --> 00:00:31,416
I'll take care of
this demon myself.

10
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,875
What are you talking about?!

11
00:00:32,958 --> 00:00:34,875
You can barely stand
on your feet right now!

12
00:00:34,958 --> 00:00:36,666
Hyde. Don't tell
me you're scared.

13
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,875
[LAWLESS growls]
No! I'm just a little worried

14
00:00:38,958 --> 00:00:40,791
because you look like
you're half dead already.

15
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:41,958
You two seem close.

16
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:43,916
[LICHT, LAWLESS]
I hate him!

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,333
[LAWLESS]
Y'know...

18
00:00:45,416 --> 00:00:46,875
I guess I shouldn't be surprised
that we don't get along.

19
00:00:46,958 --> 00:00:48,458
[LICHT] You have to understand
there's no way

20
00:00:48,541 --> 00:00:50,791
I could be on friendly
terms with a demon.

21
00:00:50,875 --> 00:00:52,500
'Cause, you see...

22
00:00:52,583 --> 00:00:55,125
...I'm an archangel sent
to purify this world.

23
00:00:55,208 --> 00:00:57,666
Look at that glow!
A holy beacon of light!

24
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,166
The ultimate musician!

25
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:00,541
No one could hope
to stand in the way

26
00:01:00,625 --> 00:01:01,958
of my violent little angel!

27
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:03,125
[LICHT]
Move it.

28
00:01:03,208 --> 00:01:07,541
[HIGAN chuckles]
Wow. Such youthful energy.

29
00:01:07,625 --> 00:01:11,208
You don't mind if this
old man cuts in, right?

30
00:01:11,291 --> 00:01:16,333
Let's dance...
my little bell. [chuckles]

31
00:01:16,416 --> 00:01:17,875
[LAWLESS, LICHT grunt]

32
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:55,750
[LAWLESS grunts]

33
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,750
[LAWLESS] Ow. Where'd
the flames come from?

34
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:02,458
It burns!

35
00:03:02,541 --> 00:03:03,666
[LICHT]
Stupid Hyde.

36
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,541
Get a hold of yourself.
I already told you,

37
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:09,041
he can make flames appear
anywhere he scratches.

38
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:10,375
You should be on your guard.

39
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:13,750
No. I'm pretty sure I'd
remember you saying that.

40
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:16,333
[LICHT] I'm not wasting time
with this old man again.

41
00:03:16,416 --> 00:03:19,208
Fine. Be that way.

42
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:21,625
You'll die first.

43
00:03:21,708 --> 00:03:24,166
[LICHT, LAWLESS]
Jekyll and Hyde!

44
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,125
[LAWLESS growls]

45
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
[HIGAN groaning]

46
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:34,541
So hot!

47
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:39,208
That was good. A solid strike.

48
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:41,041
And he's getting back up.

49
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:43,250
The old man must be
tougher than he looks.

50
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:44,875
Come on, let's stop
playing around

51
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:47,541
and take this guy out quickly.

52
00:03:47,625 --> 00:03:49,166
[LAWLESS]
Licht might look kinda weak,

53
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:51,208
but if anyone knows how
powerful his kicks can be

54
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:53,958
when he's mad, it's me.

55
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:55,708
[HIGAN] If I try to counter
Licht's attacks,

56
00:03:55,791 --> 00:03:57,375
he'll switch with Lawless.

57
00:03:57,458 --> 00:03:59,833
That Servamp can block
all of my blows.

58
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:02,625
His defense is impenetrable.

59
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:03,833
When he blocks,

60
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:05,875
I'm left open for a
small window of time,

61
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:08,750
meaning Licht can jump back
in and land an attack.

62
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:09,666
Clever strategy.

63
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,291
[HIGAN groans]

64
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:14,250
[HIGAN]
However...

65
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:19,333
[LICHT]
Uh!

66
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:20,625
Licht!

67
00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:22,458
Wait, where are the flames?

68
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:24,500
Oh. Maybe you've forgotten.

69
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:27,333
This old man's also a vampire.

70
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:31,458
Now, I'll see how you taste
and add your power to mine.

71
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:34,333
[LAWLESS groans]

72
00:04:34,416 --> 00:04:35,916
[LICHT groans]

73
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,541
[HIGAN]
Scorpion flame.

74
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:42,458
[HIGAN] I admit I'm a bit
hesitant to do this.

75
00:04:42,541 --> 00:04:45,000
Something about you
reminds me of the past.

76
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:47,125
I want to freeze this
moment and contemplate

77
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:48,791
--[LAWLESS] You okay?
--the meaning of happiness.

78
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:55,083
[HIGAN grunts] I'm going
back... into the past...

79
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:56,791
...to that time when
the whole world

80
00:04:56,875 --> 00:04:59,208
was nothing more than my canvas.

81
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:03,458
Now... I think it's time
you saw me draw.

82
00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:06,500
[MISONO] Why are you telling me
all these things about Tsubaki?

83
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:08,291
[SAKUYA]
I dunno.

84
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:10,208
Maybe just to buy some time.

85
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:14,208
Besides, you don't know how much
of what I tell you is a lie.

86
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:17,166
I can never fully commit
to the truth. It's sad.

87
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,250
[MISONO] Sorry, but we don't
have time to play along

88
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:20,625
in your little game right now.

89
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:22,541
[SAKUYA] You think you're
in control here?

90
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:25,375
You can't leave this
place until I say so.

91
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:25,958
[MISONO yelps]

92
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:27,791
[LILLY]
Misono!

93
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:29,500
I know exactly what
you're thinking.

94
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:32,250
A subclass like me could never
beat a Servamp, right?

95
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:33,000
What?!

96
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:34,416
[SAKUYA]
Did you know...

97
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,791
...that breaking the item
an Eve gave their Servamp

98
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:40,916
will break the Servamp,
too? Just like that.

99
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:48,708
[LILLY, SAKUYA grunt]

100
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:51,041
This sword was a gift
from my master.

101
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:54,083
You'll find that it has
a very unique power.

102
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:57,000
It can nullify the abilities
of other Servamps.

103
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:58,333
[LILLY yelps]

104
00:05:58,416 --> 00:05:59,750
Lilly!

105
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:09,875
[MISONO gasps]
Mikuni! You bastard...

106
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:14,291
Now is that really any way
to talk to your big brother?

107
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:17,041
Especially when he just
saved your damn life?

108
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:18,375
Mikuni. Thanks.

109
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:20,458
When are you two gonna
learn how to fight better?

110
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:22,916
Are you all right, Lilly? Huh?

111
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
The elevator on the next floor
up is still workin' fine.

112
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:28,791
Don't you wanna go
find your friends?

113
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:30,333
I don't need your help.

114
00:06:30,416 --> 00:06:31,375
[LILLY]
Misono.

115
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:32,708
[MISONO grunts]

116
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:38,041
[LILLY]
You mustn't hate him, Misono.

117
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:41,583
Someday, you'll know
the truth as well.

118
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:47,083

Hmph.

00:06:58,291 --> 00:06:59,291
Uh?!

No, Hugh!

129
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:11,375
[BERUKIA laughing]
Now. Here we go!

130
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:13,958
One! Two! Three!

131
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:16,916
Ta-da!

132
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:19,250
[TETSU]

[BERUKIA laughing]

135
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:24,166
Sorry, but you were
a little too late!

136
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:26,666
The magical vanishing Servamp
show is already over,

137
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:29,208
but please stay around
for the next act!

138
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:30,458
Where is Hugh?

139
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:31,666
Shorty...

140
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,666
I don't know what happened,
but he's gone.

141
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,083
Just disappeared.

142
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:37,791
[BERUKIA]
It was pretty easy. [laughs]

143
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:40,458
Not interesting at all.
That's my Tsu-Tsu voice!

144
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:41,500
That was awful.

145
00:07:41,583 --> 00:07:43,416
Your impressions
are a real problem.

146
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,833
I told you the three of us
could do this on our own.

147
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:47,291
It's not like we need Higan.

148
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:48,958
[MISONO] Bastards!
Where'd you send Hugh?

149
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:52,291
[BERUKIA] Huh? I'm happy to
hear my trick entertained you.

150
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:55,333
But it loses its magic if
I tell you how it's done.

151
00:07:55,416 --> 00:07:57,166
More importantly...

152
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:59,708
Shouldn't you two be way more
concerned about yourselves?

153
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:01,750
I don't think you're gonna
like the skewering party

154
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:04,583
I'm about to throw
in your honor, kids.

155
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:06,666
What are you gonna do without
any useful Servamps

156
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,125
to protect you, hm?

157
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:10,875
Sendagaya. Where's
the man named Higan?

158
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:13,375
[TETSU]
Uh? He was here earlier.

159
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:15,583
I think he's dealing with
the Greed pair right now.

160
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:17,250
Upstairs.

161
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:22,041
[MISONO] Sakuya Watanuki
said their true objective

162
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:24,416
was actually to capture Pride.

163
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,541
Tsubaki baited us
with the distance limit

164
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:29,666
so we'd be under pressure to
rush in without much planning.

165
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,458
We moved exactly like
they wanted us to.

166
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:34,791
But as long as we still
have Lilac hostage,

167
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:37,916
at least we have some
kind of leverage.

168
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,083
Should we retreat? Or fight?

169
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:42,833
[BERUKIA grunting]

170
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:46,750
[TETSU grunts]

171
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:52,041
[MISONO] The magician
said it was a trick.

172
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:54,500
Maybe he has some kind
of teleportation power.

173
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:56,416
He might have warped
Hugh somewhere.

174
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,750
We should search for him.

175
00:08:57,833 --> 00:08:59,625
But where do we start?
He could be anywhere.

176
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:02,250
[TETSU]
Misono! Tell me what to do.

177
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:04,000
You're the brains
behind all this.

178
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:07,500
C'mon, hurry!
This is looking bad.

179
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:11,250
[SAKUYA gasps]

180
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:16,375
[SAKUYA whimpering]
What?

181
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:20,791
[MISONO]
Retreat!

182
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:22,791
[LAWLESS gasping]

183
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:27,125
[ALL gasp]

184
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:30,125
[MISONO whimpers]

185
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:31,875
[SAKUYA]
Mahiru!

186
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:36,458
What the hell is this form?

187
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:39,083
Is that Kuro?
He's not a black cat.

188
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:41,666
He's a nightmare!

189
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:42,708
[roars]

190
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:44,458
[MISONO]
A lion!

191
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:50,208
[laughs]

192
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:55,750
[MAHIRU] So, yeah, Kuro's
been holding out on us

193
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:59,666
this whole time.
Sorry for being late.

194
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:04,416
Now... Let's do this. Go, Kuro!

195
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,000
[KURO]
Sure.

196
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:12,916
[MIKUNI]
Mm?! Jeje!

197
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:16,666
[sighs]

198
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:19,208
Is that Sloth?

199
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:21,333
Sleepy Ash, I don't believe it.

200
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:22,916
[MISONO]
Shirota!

201
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,125
[TETSU] The two of you showed
up at the perfect time.

202
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:26,666
You got him out of the ball?

203
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:30,708
[MAHIRU] Yeah. And the
others... are they okay?

204
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:33,375
[TETSU]
No. Hugh's gone.

205
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:34,833
[MISONO]
Berukia made him disappear

206
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:37,958
with some strange attack.
We don't know where he went.

207
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:41,208
I think the Greed pair
is on the floor above us.

208
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:44,500
[MAHIRU]
Tetsu. It's going to be fine.

209
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:47,916
First, let's go save
Lawless and Licht.

210
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,583
And then we'll track down Hugh!

211
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:54,000
And now for my
magic murder show!

212
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:55,708
[SHAMROCK]
Do you not ever shut up?

213
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:57,458
You damn clown.

214
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:01,875
[MISONO] Shirota's weapon
is changing shape!

215
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:03,833
It's not a broom anymore.

216
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:06,458
It's... a spear!

217
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:10,166
Make me proud.
My lovely marionettes.

218
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:16,875
[ALL gasping]

219
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:18,208
Berukia!

220
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:22,666
I know, I'm coming, you
don't have to yell at me!

221
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:25,333
[sighs] What a huge pain.

222
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:33,583
[SHAMROCK gasps]

223
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:34,958
[MAHIRU grunts]

224
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:41,833
[HIGAN]
That black lion I saw outside

225
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:45,000
might be a little much
for the three downstairs.

226
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:46,833
It can't be helped.

227
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:48,833
I should go save them.

228
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:52,041
[LAWLESS]
That lion was you, Brother.

229
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:55,291
I can't believe it.
After all this time.

230
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:59,291
I never thought I'd see that
powerful form ever again.

231
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:01,791
Did something change
inside of you?

232
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:07,541
Was it something that kid said?
What the hell am I doing?

233
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:08,333
[HIGAN]
Uh?

234
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:09,583
[LAWLESS grunting]

235
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:11,208
[LAWLESS] I'm the only
one who never changes

236
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:13,041
or learns anything.

237
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:15,000
[coughing]

238
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:16,583
Bad little hedgehog!

239
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:19,416
You were trying to
bite me, weren't you?

240
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,666
Here's an idea.

241
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:23,250
Why don't you lick
my shoes instead?

242
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:26,166
Play nice, and maybe I'll
even let your precious angel

243
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:28,416
walk out of here alive.

244
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,583
Huh?

245
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:32,791
Not that our kind
should care about him.

246
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:35,875
As you well know, human
lives are so fleeting.

247
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:37,125
Damn you!

248
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:39,041
[LICHT] Stay strong, you
masochistic hedgehog.

249
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:39,958
[LAWLESS]
Huh?!

250
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:41,458
[LICHT]
And as for you, Higan.

251
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:42,958
Why don't you get
down on your knees

252
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:45,166
and lick my boots instead?

253
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:48,625
[LAWLESS] This is starting
to get a little bit weird.

254
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:50,500
Actually, that's disgusting.

255
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:51,625
Never mind.

256
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:52,875
[LAWLESS]
Oh, Licht.

257
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:55,041
[HIGAN chuckles]
How about I just kick your ass?

258
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:57,750
I think that would help ease
my dear Tsubaki's sadness

259
00:12:57,833 --> 00:13:00,583
more than anything
else right now.

260
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:02,791
I am kind of sick and
tired of having to do

261
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:04,458
everything myself, though.

262
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:06,625
I've killed so many in the past,

263
00:13:06,708 --> 00:13:09,708
but no matter how many die,
I feel empty.

264
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:11,500
No matter how many
bodies pile up,

265
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:13,333
I feel melancholy.

266
00:13:13,416 --> 00:13:16,083
But I'll do whatever
Tsubaki wishes of me.

267
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:18,666
I'll draw whatever it
is he wants to see.

268
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:20,125
I won't let anything stop me

269
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:24,041
from ensuring my master
ends up happy.

270
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:25,708
It can't be helped,

271
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:28,000
however depressing
that might sound.

272
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:29,708
And anyway, self-sacrifice

273
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:33,166
is one of the most beautiful
forms of expression.

274
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:36,208
Yeah, sure, everything
you do is for Tsubaki.

275
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:40,208
But don't think that killing me
would be some kind of noble act.

276
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:43,250
It's not self-sacrifice,
or even for him.

277
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:45,458
You just want to kill me.

278
00:13:45,541 --> 00:13:47,791
I can tell from that
look in your eyes.

279
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:51,083
You're nothing but a
cold-blooded murderer.

280
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,625
[HIGAN]
He made it into... a piano?

281
00:13:56,708 --> 00:13:59,416
The sound is reverberating
through my entire body.

282
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,333
You can't carry out
your own dark desires

283
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:04,791
and blame them all
on somebody else.

284
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:06,791
That makes you weak.

285
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:10,166
[LAWLESS]
Whoa, when did he get so cool?

286
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,166
[HIGAN]
Really?

287
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,166
You think you know
better than me?

288
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:19,375
[laughs] People like you are why
this whole world is garbage!

289
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:21,625
[LICHT]
Hyde!

290
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:28,666
[LAWLESS gasping]

291
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,166
[HIGAN]
Uh?

292
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:41,125
[LAWLESS]
I will change. I'll be reborn.

293
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:42,958
Right here and now.

294
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:45,416
There's something that I desire.

295
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:48,375
I know what I want to do.

296
00:14:48,458 --> 00:14:51,166
I have to fight here,
or everything,

297
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:54,875
my whole life, will
have been for nothing!

298
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:58,625
I know the perfect story
to perform, Higan.

299
00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:01,833
And it's a role that's
wonderfully suited for you.

300
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:05,666
All about a selfish phantom who
thinks that he's been wronged.

301
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:08,416
When in fact he's
actually the villain.

302
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:11,333
[HIGAN screaming]

303
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:13,750
[LAWLESS] Too bad there's no
leading lady here to save you

304
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:16,833
with a kiss. We'll have
to find another ending.

305
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,166
[HIGAN]
So you're challenging me

306
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,166
to a one-on-one duel,
is that it?

307
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:21,166
You're mad.

308
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:23,375
This isn't Hamlet.

309
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:27,541
[LAWLESS]
You're right. I'm not Hamlet.

310
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:32,875
[HIGAN groans]

311
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:34,916
[LAWLESS] But, I'll tell
you one thing that I am.

312
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,041
[HIGAN coughs]

313
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:39,458
A hedgehog. How do
you like my spines?

314
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:46,208
[LAWLESS]
I may look tough.

315
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:50,375
But I have to admit that
took a lot outta me.

316
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:55,458
[groaning] Man, I'm exhausted
after that performance.

317
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:56,750
[LICHT]
Whatever, let's go home.

318
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:58,375
[LAWLESS]
But you're hurt!

319
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:03,083
[LAWLESS]
Uh! What did I say?

320
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:08,875
I can fight.

321
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:14,125
I could have fought back then.
I could have fought for her.

322
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:17,333
If only I'd gone
after my dreams.

323
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:20,625
How different would
things have turned out?

324
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:22,000
Stupid hedgehog.

325
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:24,958
Don't worry about what
you could have done.

326
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:28,625
There's no point in doing that.

327
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:31,291
You should be concerned
about the present.

328
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:32,666
What you should fight for now.

329
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:35,083
Ah. Yeah. Now...

330
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:39,916
That's a good lesson, angel.
When'd you go and get all wise?

331
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:46,708
[MAHIRU]
Licht! Lawless! Uh?!

332
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:54,500
Did you... come to
listen to me play?

333
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:56,916
No. I came to save your life.

334
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,500
For real this time.

335
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:01,666
[LICHT]
Heh. Little late.

336
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:05,125
A virtuoso like me doesn't
need anyone protecting him.

337
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:06,541
[MAHIRU]
Uh! Licht!

338
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:09,041
[LICHT]
Your eyes look different.

339
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:10,750
Something's changed.

340
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:13,458
You're close to being
an angel, like me.

341
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:15,000
[MAHIRU]
Mm. Just to be clear,

342
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:18,583
I'm assuming you mean that to
be a compliment, didn't you?

343
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:22,083
Well, then...

344
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:24,250
This isn't how we
planned things to go.

345
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:27,500
Though, at least we did manage
to save Greed and his Eve.

346
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:32,625
That part was a success.
But... Hugh's gone.

347
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,666
Misono. Where's Lila?

348
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:38,833
Oh. He's right here.

349
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:41,666
[LILAC whimpers]

350
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,250
[MAHIRU]
Lila!

351
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:44,916
[MISONO]
He was never with Gil.

352
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
It made sense to have
our hostage here.

353
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:48,916
That way we would have
been in a better position

354
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,458
to negotiate if
Tsubaki showed up.

355
00:17:51,541 --> 00:17:53,125
Kuro...

356
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:57,541
Yeah, I know that you're right.

357
00:17:57,625 --> 00:18:00,583
This is gonna be so
troublesome, though.

358
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:04,291
Lawless. I, uh...

359
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:07,125
I have to... thank you. 'Kay?

360
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:08,458
What...?

361
00:18:08,541 --> 00:18:10,666
[KURO] You were the only
one who never forgave me.

362
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:13,125
Who never forgot about
what I'd done.

363
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:14,458
Knowing that,

364
00:18:14,541 --> 00:18:16,708
a part of me questioned
if my actions were right.

365
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:19,791
Because of you, I was finally
able to face my regret.

366
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:22,083
So Anyway...

367
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,125
[KURO]
...thank you...

368
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:28,750
...for not forgiving me.

369
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:33,666
What? You're talking crazy.

370
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:37,166
You're supposed to thank people
when they do forgive you, idiot.

371
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,416
Maybe.

372
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:41,333
I was happy to see you
in that form again.

373
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:45,458
It'd been a while, Brother.

374
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,958
[LAWLESS]
Things feel different.

375
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:53,875
I see it now. There was
meaning... all along.

376
00:18:57,125 --> 00:18:58,666
But nothing has changed.

377
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:01,500
There's still a lot of stuff
we have to work through.

378
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:04,458
Everything's not all
hunky dory between us.

379
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:06,375
[KURO]
Yeah, I know.

380
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:11,291
But it's a new beginning.

381
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:17,875
What was your name?

382
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:20,791
I, uh... Kind of forgot.

383
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:22,916
Mahiru Shirota.

384
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,625
[LAWLESS]
Mahiru. Thank you, too.

385
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,125
[gasps]

386
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:31,333
[laughs]

387
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:35,375
[MAHIRU] Okay, Lawless.
Now it's your turn.

388
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:36,208
[LAWLESS]
Mm?

389
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:38,000
[MAHIRU]
What's your name?

390
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:40,708
C'mon. It won't change
for a while, right?

391
00:19:40,791 --> 00:19:44,583
[LAWLESS] Uh. Heh. Who's to say
what the future holds for us?

392
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:46,958
This dumb angel might end
up pissin' me off so bad

393
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:48,083
I have to murder him.

394
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:50,208
So, no. Just keep
calling me Lawless,

395
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:51,500
or whatever you
were before, okay?

396
00:19:51,583 --> 00:19:54,208
Oh, come on, Brother.
Don't be such a drag.

397
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:55,750
Just tell us.

398
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:57,875
It'll be so much weirder if
we find out what it is later

399
00:19:57,958 --> 00:20:00,000
when you could have said
something right now.

400
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:02,208
[LAWLESS] You don't know
that, you stupid kid.

401
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:06,833
Okay, don't laugh.
My name... is Hyde.

402
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:08,458
Is that a hand-engraved tag?

403
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,625
[LAWLESS] Don't you dare
make fun of my nametag

404
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:12,250
because you were given
some dumb random cat bell.

405
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:13,708
Hey, that bell is really nice!

406
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:15,041
[LICHT]
Stupid hedgehog.

407
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:17,333
Do you have a problem with
the gift I gave you?

408
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:20,083
[LAWLESS] Why are you always
so violent towards me, huh?

409
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:22,166
[LAWLESS laughs]

410
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:24,875
[LILAC] You shouldn't
be allowed to laugh.

411
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:30,041
Lila?

412
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:32,291
[LILAC]
What you did can't be forgiven.

413
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:34,666
You shouldn't be
allowed happiness.

414
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:37,208
You killed every
one of my friends!

415
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:39,125
You monster!

416
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:41,291
[LILAC]
If I take this,

417
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:44,166
maybe their deaths
won't have been in vain.

418
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:46,791
Servamps are sins,
and Eves their salvation.

419
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:48,125
So you see...

420
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:50,958
If you destroy the item an
Eve gave to his vampire,

421
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:55,333
then you'll find that the
Servamp will be broken.

422
00:20:55,416 --> 00:20:58,666
Uh! Wait, Lila, no!
Don't do this!

423
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,416
I'm sorry, Mahiru.

424
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:03,208
I'm really grateful for
everything that you've done.

425
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:06,250
But still, you're a loyal
person, and you'd do anything

426
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:09,000
to avenge your friends,
wouldn't you?

427
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:11,458
So you have to understand...

428
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:16,791
...what I'm doing... I'm
honoring my friends now.

429
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:20,166
I know I'm trying to hurt
people who you care about.

430
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:22,833
So you have the right
to try and kill me.

431
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:24,750
It would be justified.

432
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:27,750
Just like I have the right
to destroy this item

433
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:31,041
and break that monster.
One of us is done.

434
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:34,083
See? It's over!

435
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:38,750
[TSUBAKI]
I found you, dear.

436
00:21:38,833 --> 00:21:42,458
So you're the hostage.
Don't worry, I'm here now.

437
00:21:42,541 --> 00:21:43,875
[MAHIRU]
Tsubaki?

438
00:21:43,958 --> 00:21:46,166
[TSUBAKI] You must have
been so frightened all alone.

439
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:48,833
I'm sorry it took so long
for me to find you.

440
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:51,541
Now. Give me that.

441
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:53,083
[MISONO]
What's going on?

442
00:21:53,166 --> 00:21:55,250
Why is Tsubaki already back?

443
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:58,000
[TSUBAKI]
Wow, you even defeated Higan.

444
00:21:58,083 --> 00:21:59,750
It looks like Greed and his Eve

445
00:21:59,833 --> 00:22:01,916
really went on a
rampage in here.

446
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,625
What a mess.

447
00:22:03,708 --> 00:22:06,583
Oh. Hey, Big Brother Sloth.

448
00:22:06,666 --> 00:22:11,166
I finally found it... Teacher.

449
00:23:42,291 --> 00:23:44,875
[MAHIRU] How are we already
at the last episode?

450
00:23:44,958 --> 00:23:46,125
[KURO]
Finally, I can rest.

451
00:23:46,208 --> 00:23:46,958
[MAHIRU]
Lazy cat!
