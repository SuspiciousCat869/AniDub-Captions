[gasps]

2
00:00:17,583 --> 00:00:19,458
How did I get in my room?

3
00:00:21,541 --> 00:00:24,333
Was all that a bad dream?

4
00:00:24,416 --> 00:00:26,000
Hey, put me down, will ya?

5
00:00:26,083 --> 00:00:29,416
I am having the best dream
adventure and finally found it.

6
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,916
My prize... ultimate pillow.
So soft!

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,833
That sounds like the
dumbest adventure.

8
00:00:34,916 --> 00:00:38,125
Wait, if you're talking,
then it wasn't a dream.

9
00:02:09,583 --> 00:02:11,291
[MAHIRU panting]

10
00:02:11,375 --> 00:02:12,416
Ryusei!

11
00:02:13,958 --> 00:02:15,375
Oh. Hey, Mahiru.

12
00:02:15,458 --> 00:02:17,833
Sakuya! Is Ryusei okay?

13
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,083
No.

14
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:23,208
[MAHIRU gasps]

15
00:02:23,291 --> 00:02:24,458
[RYUSEI]
Look alive!

16
00:02:26,208 --> 00:02:28,791
[RYUSEI] That's the kinda
tape you needed, right?

17
00:02:28,875 --> 00:02:30,250
[MAHIRU]
Ryusei!

18
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:31,375
Huh?

19
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:33,541
Hey. So you decided
to come after all.

20
00:02:33,625 --> 00:02:35,583
Why'd you scare me
like that, Sakuya?

21
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:37,625
[SAKUYA] It was a joke;
you seemed so serious!

22
00:02:37,708 --> 00:02:39,583
I thought I'd play along
and maybe make something up.

23
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:40,708
[yells]

24
00:02:40,791 --> 00:02:42,083
Anyway, how's your
neck doing, Ryusei?

25
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:45,000
--Does it hurt much?
--Eh. It's not that bad.

26
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:46,875
I was lucky the car
barely hit me.

27
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:49,125
The accident could've
been a lot worse.

28
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:50,500
A car accident?

29
00:02:50,583 --> 00:02:52,541
[KOYUKI]
But still, it was pretty scary.

30
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:55,625
What are you guys talking about?
That's not what happened!

31
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:58,875
[KOYUKI] Huh? Some kind of
vampire street performer?

32
00:02:58,958 --> 00:03:00,333
You sound like Sakuya.

33
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:02,708
Are you gonna start telling
stories all the time, too?

34
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:05,000
It's not like you were even
out there with us yesterday

35
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:06,916
to see how things went down.

36
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,875
We don't have time
to play around.

37
00:03:08,958 --> 00:03:11,916
There's still a ton of stuff
to do for the school festival.

38
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,083
[MAHIRU]
Something's wrong.

39
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:14,541
They don't remember
I was with them,

40
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:16,125
or that we were attacked.

41
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:17,958
It's like their minds
have been wiped.

42
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:20,375
But that wouldn't explain
their new memories.

43
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:22,958
Ugh! This just
doesn't make any sense!

44
00:03:23,041 --> 00:03:24,208
[KURO]
Hey!

45
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:26,291
[BERUKIA] I keep getting
cat hair in my mouth!

46
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:27,500
What the hell?

47
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:28,791
When'd you get in here?

48
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,125
I am so very hungry!

49
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:31,833
Please just let me have
a little bit of blood!

50
00:03:31,916 --> 00:03:32,875
Pretty please!

51
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:34,208
Keep it down and
tell me why everyone

52
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:35,458
is being so weird.

53
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:37,041
It's like yesterday
didn't even happen!

54
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:38,041
[GIRL 2A]
What's with that boy?

55
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:39,625
[GIRL 2B]
Is he yelling at a doll?

56
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:41,333
[BERUKIA]
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

57
00:03:41,416 --> 00:03:43,000
What are you doing,
you stupid little brat?

58
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:45,583
I hope Tsubaki murders you soon!

59
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:48,250
[MAHIRU] Who is this Tsubaki
guy he keeps talking about?

60
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:50,125
You're sure that name
doesn't ring a bell?

61
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:51,666
[KURO] No, and I can't
imagine who'd want to hurt

62
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,791
a cute, loveable cat
like yours truly.

63
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:55,625
Stop pretending you're
some kinda harmless kitten

64
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:57,250
and not a vampire.

65
00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:58,750
[KURO]
Meow.

66
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:00,583
[MAHIRU] Let's think
about it in simple terms.

67
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:03,041
This Tsubaki person
is obviously our enemy.

68
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:04,416
If we don't do
something about him,

69
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,500
he might send more vampires
to attack you... and me.

70
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:13,708
[MAHIRU] Huh?
Sunshine while it's raining?

71
00:04:21,916 --> 00:04:23,000
[MAHIRU]
What is this?!

72
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:26,208
[TSUBAKI]
Hey, you.

73
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:29,250
Why don't you tell me a story?

74
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:30,583
Something good.

75
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,791
I want to know about
the most interesting thing

76
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:35,583
that's happened to you.

77
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:40,708
[BERUKIA] Tell him how your kitty
turned out to be a vampire!

78
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:42,750
Or maybe how you used
him to try and murder

79
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:44,791
a brilliant street magician
who was just putting on

80
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:46,041
a good show!

81
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:48,125
I have a feeling this
is gonna be a real pain.

82
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:51,166
Wait--So is he...
a vampire, too?

83
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:56,208
[TSUBAKI laughing]

84
00:05:02,416 --> 00:05:03,833
I'm already bored.

85
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:07,208
What, are you
trying to hide, now?

86
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:09,375
Wait--Do you know
this guy or something?

87
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:10,583
Not a clue.

88
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:12,708
But he's got a real
crazy look in his eyes.

89
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:14,000
[TSUBAKI]
Wonderful.

90
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:16,250
I've been looking
for this fiend.

91
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:18,416
Thanks for picking
him up for me.

92
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:22,250
Ugh, it was so cramped in there.

93
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:24,458
You're very late,
my precious Tsu-Tsu.

94
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:27,208
Precious... Tsu-Tsu?

95
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:28,458
[BERUKIA]
But you did come for me.

96
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:30,125
I'll forgive you, Tsu-Tsu.

97
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:32,916
[MAHIRU]
Tsubaki... It must be him!

98
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,666
That was fast. Why's he here?

99
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,708
This might not be the
best time to ask questions.

100
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:38,583
We should get out
of here while we can.

101
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:42,333
[TSUBAKI] Yes.
I am the one called Tsubaki.

102
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:44,333
So what?

103
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:46,916
I'm the one who's chosen to
challenge the both of you.

104
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,375
So what?

105
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:50,291
And I'm also the one
who wants to massacre

106
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:53,250
lots and lots of
vampires and humans.

107
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:54,500
So what?

108
00:05:56,708 --> 00:05:59,375
I'm feeling a bit bored
and depressed today.

109
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:02,125
You know what would help,
Sleepy Ash of Sloth?

110
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:04,791
You could tell me a
really interesting story.

111
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:07,125
If you don't,
I'll have no choice--

112
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:08,958
we'll just have to go to war.

113
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:11,250
Huh? What are you
even talking about?

114
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:13,291
[TSUBAKI]
Come on, big brother.

115
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:15,416
Wait, what?

116
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,458
You're Kuro's... little brother?

117
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:19,458
No, he must be off his rocker.

118
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:20,708
I've never met him before.

119
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:24,541
[TSUBAKI laughing]

120
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:26,458
Terrible! Heartbreaking!

121
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:28,333
So you don't know
who I am, either?

122
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:30,875
None of my Servamp
siblings know I existed!

123
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:32,166
Can you imagine?

124
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:35,208
[laughing]

125
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:39,000
Say...

126
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:42,583
Do you know how many
Servamps there are, kid?

127
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:44,291
There's seven of us.

128
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:46,916
Sure. It's seven.

129
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,458
Sleepy Ash of Sloth.

130
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:52,500
Old Child of Pride.

131
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:55,000
Doubt Doubt of Envy.

132
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:57,625
The Mother of Wrath.

133
00:06:57,708 --> 00:07:00,625
Lawless of Greed.

134
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:03,000
World End of Gluttony.

135
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:06,750
And of course,
All of Love of Lust.

136
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:08,166
You might think that these seven

137
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,833
are the only true
vampires in the world.

138
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:13,708
But there's actually
one more in the family.

139
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:16,041
I'm the Servamp of Melancholy.

140
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:18,416
The eighth true
vampire in our line.

141
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,958
My nickname is "Who is Coming."

142
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:24,208
And I'm the youngest
of the Servamps.

143
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:27,000
Kuro, you have so many siblings.

144
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:28,375
Is it 'cause you're a cat?

145
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:31,000
No. And besides, I'm the
only cat of the litter.

146
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:32,208
[TSUBAKI chuckles]

147
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:35,250
[TSUBAKI]
He's right.

148
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:36,916
This is what I
can transform into.

149
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,250
Hey, get off me if you're
gonna chase each other!

150
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:42,541
So, you're a dog, huh?

151
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:45,250
Don't insult me
by calling me that.

152
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:46,916
My form is a fox.

153
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,833
[TSUBAKI laughing]

154
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:51,000
Not interesting at all.

155
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:52,500
Tsu-Tsu.

156
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:54,041
These two idiots kept me from
murdering all those people

157
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:55,166
like you ordered me to.

158
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,833
They ruined everything.

159
00:07:57,916 --> 00:07:59,208
Tsubaki.

160
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:01,666
Why do you want to
kill so many people?

161
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,416
Oh, you want a motive?

162
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,750
Maybe it's just that I'm
not so fond of humans.

163
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:08,208
You understand, right?

164
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:10,916
You attacked this vampire
because you didn't like him.

165
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,083
It's the same thing.

166
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:14,583
Tell me...

167
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:16,583
Do you know how many people
died in this town yesterday?

168
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:18,125
No idea, right?

169
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:20,708
Then does it really matter
how many of them we killed?

170
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:22,291
Does it make a difference?

171
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:24,541
No, I think not.

172
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:26,625
Are you crazy?!
Of course it matters!

173
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:28,250
Why hurt innocent people
when they haven't

174
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:29,791
done anything to you?!

175
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:31,625
[TSUBAKI]
That's just it.

176
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:33,291
They'd all be much
more interesting

177
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:35,416
if they could only realize
they're an integral part

178
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,458
of my big plans for the future.

179
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:38,791
Especially you...

180
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:44,583
...my dear brother,
little Sleepy Ash.

181
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:52,791
[TSUBAKI]
Hey, don't just lie there.

182
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:55,625
Now that we're together,
why don't we play?

183
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,916
[TSUBAKI] All of you
have forgotten about me.

184
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,541
No... you want to forget.

185
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:04,750
I won't let you.

186
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:08,625
I want us to reunite
in a great big party.

187
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:10,500
Why don't you call the
rest of our siblings here

188
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:11,916
for me, brother?

189
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,875
My teacher would be
so happy if we could all

190
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:15,916
gather together in one place.

191
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,458
Then I could make this
world--regret everything--

192
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:21,833
its entire worthless existence!

193
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:27,875
[MAHIRU]
Kuro! Drink my blood!

194
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:29,958
[KURO]
No thanks.

195
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:31,875
I'm still really
sore from yesterday.

196
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:33,166
[MAHIRU]
You're so lazy!

197
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:37,875
[KURO coughs]

198
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:38,958
Don't!

199
00:09:40,916 --> 00:09:42,166
[MAHIRU]
I don't get it.

200
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,958
You want to start a war? Why?

201
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,125
Kuro!

202
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:51,333
[TSUBAKI]
Because it would be interesting.

203
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:54,083
I don't really care
who lives or dies.

204
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:55,458
The only thing
that matters to me

205
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:58,166
is that it's
entertaining to witness.

206
00:09:58,250 --> 00:09:59,875
[MAHIRU]
What's with this guy?

207
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:02,875
He's talking crazy!
He's completely out of his mind!

208
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:06,500
[TSUBAKI] A kid like you
has no idea how I feel.

209
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:09,083
Not just you, nobody gets me.

210
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:13,041
No one in the world truly
understands how I yearn.

211
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:15,625
[MAHIRU]
This... sounds kind of familiar.

212
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:18,833
[MAHIRU]
Back then...

213
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:19,916
[MAHIRU]
Mom.

214
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:22,708
[TORU]
You sure you're ready?

215
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:25,541
You can take a few
more days off, y'know.

216
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,541
No, I'm okay, Uncle. I'll go.

217
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:29,000
It'll be fine.

218
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Mahiru? How are you feeling?

219
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:35,875
You know you can talk
to me about anything, right?

220
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:37,041
--[MAHIRU] Koyuki.
--Hey!

221
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:38,375
Let's go play some soccer!

222
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:40,875
I've been working on some
cool new moves for us.

223
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:42,250
[MAHIRU]
Ryusei.

224
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:44,750
Thanks, you guys. Really.

225
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:47,500
But I'm gonna head home now.
I've got stuff to do.

226
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:48,708
Huh?

227
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:49,916
What?

228
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,166
[RYUSEI]
Well, let's play tomorrow, then!

229
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,541
[TORU]
Mahiru?

230
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:02,625
[TORU]
Come here, kid.

231
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:05,375
What's the matter?

232
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:08,166
Did something bad
happen at school today?

233
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,208
[MAHIRU]
No. Nothing.

234
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:13,916
Everyone was super nice.
They asked me to play with them.

235
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,916
But... I just didn't feel
like doing anything.

236
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,458
I don't know why.

237
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:21,125
I want you to think about
what you're feeling right now.

238
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:23,125
If you can't understand
your own emotions,

239
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:24,833
you'll never be able
to connect with others

240
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:28,083
who are trying to reach
out and be there for you.

241
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:30,125
Try giving a name
to whatever it is

242
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:31,875
that's in your heart right now.

243
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:35,208
Even if it's sadness,
you have to feel that emotion.

244
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:37,166
That's the only way
you'll overcome it

245
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:39,083
and be able to
let other others in.

246
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:41,166
You'll never be able
to face anyone else

247
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,791
until you face yourself.

248
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:45,541
And you have to be honest
to understand that.

249
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:47,166
Nothing's interesting
to you because you aren't

250
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:48,791
facing your feelings honestly.

251
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,833
It's no wonder you're so bored.

252
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:52,208
You feel like no one
understands you,

253
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:54,458
but you don't even
understand yourself.

254
00:11:54,541 --> 00:11:57,250
So how is anyone else supposed
to care about what you want?

255
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:58,291
[TSUBAKI]
Huh?

256
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:02,958
[laughing]

257
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:04,500
[TSUBAKI]
Maybe you're right.

258
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:07,166
But that just makes me want
to start a war even more!

259
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:09,166
Fighting is a method
of communication.

260
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:10,625
Look at it that way.

261
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:11,958
No! You're wrong!

262
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:13,250
I won't let you do this.

263
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:15,541
I'll stop you before
you can kill anyone else.

264
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:17,500
I'll use everything
I've learned about Servamps

265
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:18,833
in the last day.

266
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,458
If I name you and
make you drink my blood,

267
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:25,333
then you'll have
to obey me, right?

268
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:27,625
That's how it works.

269
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:29,958
So I challenge you
to face me head on!

270
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:34,500
But first I'll give
you a new name.

271
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:38,375
Really?

272
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:40,916
But what if someone murders you
before you're able to do that?

273
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,708
Mahiru! Watch out!

274
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:51,333
[TSUBAKI]
Where'd they disappear to?

275
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:53,916
And just when things
were getting good.

276
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,833
[BERUKIA] Are you just gonna
let them get away like that,

277
00:12:55,916 --> 00:12:57,083
Tsu-Tsu?

278
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:59,000
[TSUBAKI] Don't worry.
We'll have plenty of fun

279
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:00,500
with them later.

280
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:04,458
I already have a name,
right, Teacher? Tsubaki.

281
00:13:06,708 --> 00:13:08,625
[TSUBAKI]
They're not interesting at all.

282
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:12,708
Gah! What happened?
And where are we?

283
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:13,541
[sighs]

284
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:15,500
Somebody must've saved us.

285
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:17,250
Probably another Servamp.

286
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:23,000
[MAHIRU]
One of your siblings? Really?

287
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:24,333
Yeah, if I had to guess.

288
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:27,000
[YULEE, MARIE]
Mahiru Shirota.

289
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:28,708
Please follow us.

290
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:32,250
All of Love is summoning
you now--Come!

291
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:34,416
--Who, me?
--[YULEE, MARIE] Please.

292
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,708
[KURO] What a drag.
I think I'll sit this one out.

293
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:40,375
[MISONO] I know it's out
of the ordinary,

294
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:43,375
but I must insist
you come with me.

295
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:46,666
And I won't accept any
answer other than "yes."

296
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:50,250
--[YULEE] Kitty.
--[MARIE] Kitty.

297
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:52,708
[MAHIRU] So are you the one
that they call All of Love?

298
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:53,625
[MISONO]
I'm not.

299
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:55,916
My name is Misono Alicein.

300
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,916
[MAHIRU]
Misono Alicein?

301
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,833
I'm the Eve for All of Love.

302
00:13:59,916 --> 00:14:01,791
The seventh Servamp.

303
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:03,166
[MAHIRU]
Eve?

304
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,583
[MISONO] That's a master
who's contracted a Servamp.

305
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:08,666
Oh, so we're the same.
I'm an Eve, too!

306
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:11,500
[MAHIRU]
Huh. I wonder who his Eve is.

307
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,375
[MISONO]
That's my place ahead.

308
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:18,416
[MAHIRU] Holy crap!
This place is gigantic.

309
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,791
[MISONO sighs]

310
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:21,958
I'm tired. Let's rest a bit.

311
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:23,541
[MAHIRU] It's only been 5
minutes since we got out

312
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:25,083
of the car and you
have to sit?!

313
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:26,833
And where did that
chair even come from?!

314
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:28,291
[LILLY laughing]

315
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:30,166
Unfortunately,
Misono has something

316
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:34,500
of a weak constitution,
my dear Mahiru.

317
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:36,416
What are you looking at?

318
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,750
Gah! Lilly, I keep telling
you not to land in my hair!

319
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:40,958
[MAHIRU]
A butterfly?

320
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:46,291
Nice to meet you.

321
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:48,875
Please let me know if there's
anything that you desire.

322
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:51,333
Put your clothes back on!

323
00:14:51,416 --> 00:14:55,500
What? I was just trying to
make a good first impression.

324
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:58,750
Allow me to introduce this
stripping perv, All of Love.

325
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:00,083
The Servamp of Lust.

326
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:02,750
My Eve has given me
the name of Snowlily.

327
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:05,291
But please, feel free to
call me whatever you'd like.

328
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:06,666
Stop that!

329
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:09,916
[KURO] You haven't changed
at all, have you?

330
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,291
It's very nice to
see you, too, brother.

331
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:14,250
Now please, come inside.

332
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:15,750
[MAHIRU]
Get off of me.

333
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:18,666
[LILLY] I am the one who helped
you out behind the scenes

334
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,875
with that horrible
magician business.

335
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:23,250
[MAHIRU] He's the one
that made everyone forget.

336
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:24,666
Oh, thank you!

337
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,875
It's nice to meet
someone on our side.

338
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:29,291
There are so many things
I want to ask you guys.

339
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:31,166
[LILLY] Before we get
to your questions,

340
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:34,333
there's something
we have to ask you.

341
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:36,916
I didn't help you out just
because I was feeling kind,

342
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,250
unfortunately.

343
00:15:44,916 --> 00:15:46,041
Here, Lilly.

344
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:56,291
[MISONO]
Mahiru, you bastard.

345
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:58,000
I hear you didn't launch
a single attack

346
00:15:58,083 --> 00:15:59,583
when you faced Tsubaki today.

347
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:01,916
Misono...
You know about Tsubaki, t--

348
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,666
[MISONO] You haven't earned
the right to say my name.

349
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:05,833
How pathetic.

350
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:07,333
You don't understand
what it means

351
00:16:07,416 --> 00:16:10,083
to be a Servamp's master at all.

352
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:13,333
Mahiru Shirota.
You must become my servant.

353
00:16:13,416 --> 00:16:14,791
I'll give the orders now.

354
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:18,333
And you'll tell Sloth
what I want him to do.

355
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:20,083
I'm afraid you don't
have a choice.

356
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:21,541
You must say "yes."

357
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:26,625
I really would like
to resolve this peacefully

358
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:28,166
if it's at all possible.

359
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:30,416
You'll be a good boy and
play along nicely, now,

360
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,500
won't you?

361
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:35,166
Things are turning
into a mess again.

362
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:36,750
You can't just
order us around!

363
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:38,458
I only came here
to get some answers!

364
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:40,666
You're not very quick
on the uptake, are you?

365
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:43,333
Ugh, This is why I hate
working with commoners.

366
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:44,875
What?

367
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:46,666
Look, you're obviously rich,
but do you really have to act

368
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,583
like such an
arrogant jerk to us?

369
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:50,458
How do you expect me to
trust you after you showed up

370
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:52,500
outta nowhere and
demanded that we obey you?

371
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:54,791
Peasant! How dare you
talk to me that way?

372
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:56,583
[MAHIRU]
That's it, Kuro, we're leaving!

373
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:01,416
[MAHIRU] And here I thought we'd
found an ally in this fight.

374
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,750
Dammit.

375
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:04,458
[MISONO sighs]
Idiot.

376
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:07,375
Well, Misono.
What shall we do now?

377
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:12,791
[MAHIRU] Man. This place
is like one big maze.

378
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:15,166
[KURO] Yeah, this definitely
isn't the way out.

379
00:17:18,291 --> 00:17:20,916
[whispering]

380
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,208
[MAHIRU]
Who are they?

381
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:29,541
[MAHIRU] Children?
And why are there so many?

382
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:31,541
They can't all be
Lilly's kids, can they?

383
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:33,291
I know he's Lust,
but that is nuts!

384
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:35,083
No, no--Certainly not.

385
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:37,791
All those cute kiddos
are just my subclass.

386
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:39,541
Your subclass?

387
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:41,541
[LILLY] Subclasses are
lower-level vampires

388
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:43,625
that have been
created by a Servamp.

389
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:45,125
Our servants.

390
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:47,333
They follow the orders of
the vampire who created them.

391
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:51,291
[MAHIRU] So those kids
are vampires, too.

392
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:53,750
[LILLY] Tsubaki's minions have
started killing subclasses

393
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:55,000
like these children.

394
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:56,958
They seem to be
his first targets.

395
00:17:57,041 --> 00:17:59,166
We know of two who were
murdered this week alone.

396
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:00,458
Possibly more.

397
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,791
[MISONO] Do you know how
to play chess, Mahiru?

398
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:07,250
[MAHIRU]
I guess. Why?

399
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:08,791
[MISONO]
As the game goes on,

400
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:11,583
the number of pieces on the
board gets smaller and smaller.

401
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:14,708
But as long as your
king survives, you win.

402
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:16,250
It's unfair.

403
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:17,791
And it's not how battles should
be fought in the real world,

404
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:19,291
either, understand?

405
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:26,166
I don't want to hide on some
throne and be protected.

406
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:28,625
That's why I need all the
power I can get on my side.

407
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:32,375
I need so much more
than I have--[grunts]

408
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:36,166
Tell me, what do you plan
on doing with your strength?

409
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:39,875
There's a single Eve for every
Servamp, and you're one of them.

410
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:41,541
So what's driving you?

411
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:44,500
Can you use Sloth's powers
to achieve your goals?

412
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,625
No way!
He just attacked my friend!

413
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:50,541
[YULEE, MARIE]
Mahiru Shirota.

414
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:53,375
You'll help this lonesome
king, won't you? Please?

415
00:18:57,291 --> 00:18:59,166
[MAHIRU]
You know... I get it.

416
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:03,166
Simply speaking, you're just
trying to protect people.

417
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:05,166
I don't think you have
to do all this alone.

418
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:07,541
Wouldn't it help if
others were by your side?

419
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:09,666
You need allies.

420
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:10,958
Misono...

421
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:13,041
Kuro and I will help you.

422
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:15,958
Only not as your servants,
but as your friends.

423
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:18,625
Hey, don't drag me into this.

424
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:20,208
Okay I guess.

425
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:22,791
If you won't be a servant--then
we can try things out this way.

426
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:24,416
It's not that a big difference.

427
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,625
[LILLY chuckles]

428
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:27,333
What do you think you're
laughing at, Lilly?!

429
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,083
Come back here!

430
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:31,083
By the way, Mahiru...

431
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:32,291
Since you're new to this,

432
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:34,541
you don't have a
weapon yet, do you?

433
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:36,041
--[MAHIRU] Weapon?
--[MISONO] Of course!

434
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:38,416
You don't plan on fighting
vampires empty-handed.

435
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,750
An Eve has the ability
to wield a custom weapon

436
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:42,625
created from
their Servamp's power.

437
00:19:42,708 --> 00:19:44,125
[MAHIRU]
What? Seriously?

438
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:46,208
What a novice.

439
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:48,916
I suppose I'll have to teach
you everything, won't I?

440
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,375
Yeah. Please do!
You'll be like my mentor.

441
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:58,666
[MAHIRU] That day I found
someone who'd fight by my side.

442
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:00,166
A great ally.

443
00:20:02,416 --> 00:20:04,458
[SAKUYA]
Mahiru?

444
00:20:04,541 --> 00:20:06,958
So you decided to
keep the cat after all.

445
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:07,958
Uh--Yeah.

446
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:09,125
Better watch out, then--

447
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,875
you know black cats
are really bad luck.

448
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:13,041
[MAHIRU]
Oh don't worry.

449
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:14,833
He's just a normal cat.

450
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:17,083
Okay, fine, if you say so.

451
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:19,166
[MAHIRU] Ooh! I think I'm
gonna buy this wristband.

452
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:20,458
[SAKUYA]
What?

453
00:20:20,541 --> 00:20:22,250
[MAHIRU] Remember?
I lost mine somewhere.

454
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:25,583
No, you can't do that,
because, you see...

455
00:20:25,666 --> 00:20:28,666
Aw, jeez! Here!

456
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:29,708
[MAHIRU]
Uh...

457
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:35,208
For me?

458
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:38,000
After you told me
you lost yours, I saw this.

459
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:40,125
I figured I'd go
ahead and buy it.

460
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:42,041
I was gonna give it
to you later.

461
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:43,458
Sakuya.

462
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:47,166
I know it's kinda weird,
but don't make a big deal of it.

463
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:49,000
I won't, but thank you, Sakuya.

464
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:51,041
[SAKUYA]
I feel dumb now.

465
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:52,500
I didn't say stop.

466
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:56,625
[growling noise]

467
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:00,083
[SAKUYA]
What's wrong?

468
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:02,083
[MAHIRU]
Oh, it's nothing.

469
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:04,125
[SAKUYA] Sure you didn't
see something strange?

470
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:07,583
Maybe those rumors are true!

471
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:09,000
[MAHIRU]
Hey, Sakuya.

472
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:11,291
This is out of nowhere,
but tell me if anything strange

473
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:12,916
happens to you, okay?

474
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,666
I'll take care of it for you.

475
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:17,333
[SAKUYA] So you're some
kinda vampire slayer now?

476
00:21:17,416 --> 00:21:18,666
Hey, Mahiru.

477
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:21,000
You've kind of been
acting super weird lately.

478
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:22,958
Did something happen to you?

479
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:26,625
You wouldn't hide
anything from me, right?

480
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:27,958
Because we're friends.

481
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:30,958
That means you're supposed
to be able to trust me.

482
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,416
[MAHIRU]
Nothing's going on with me!

483
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,000
[laughs nervously]

484
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:40,833
[MAHIRU]
Sorry to frighten you, Sakuya.

485
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:42,291
But I'll be fine.

486
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:44,375
[SAKUYA]
See you later!

487
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:49,666
I know I was lying when I said
Kuro is just a normal cat.

488
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:52,125
But what was I supposed to say?

489
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:53,583
[KURO yawns]

490
00:21:53,666 --> 00:21:57,041
In that moment I was happy
about how things were going.

491
00:21:57,125 --> 00:22:00,666
I now controlled a power
that could keep people safe.

492
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,416
But...

493
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,750
[MONSTER screeches]

494
00:22:08,958 --> 00:22:10,541
[MAHIRU] ...things don't
always turn out how you think

495
00:22:10,625 --> 00:22:11,750
they will.

496
00:23:42,375 --> 00:23:43,750
[TSUBAKI laughing]

497
00:23:43,833 --> 00:23:45,375
Not intwesting at ahl.

498
00:23:45,458 --> 00:23:46,958
[BERUKIA]
He bit his tongue!
