1
00:00:16,708 --> 00:00:18,875
You should've been able
to save her, Kazuki!

2
00:00:18,958 --> 00:00:21,625
You were piloting
a Fafner, weren't you?!

3
00:00:21,708 --> 00:00:23,291
Then why didn't you?!

4
00:00:31,875 --> 00:00:34,541
If it had been a real battle,
this would've been a casket...

5
00:00:34,625 --> 00:00:36,458
Someone made a good shot.

6
00:00:36,541 --> 00:00:37,958
Huh?

7
00:00:38,041 --> 00:00:39,125
Yeah, you're right.

8
00:00:39,208 --> 00:00:40,500
This is the island that we found

9
00:00:40,583 --> 00:00:42,625
three hundred fifty
kilometers to the north.

10
00:00:42,708 --> 00:00:44,166
It certainly looks similar.

11
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:45,625
Alvis isn't the
only island that was

12
00:00:45,708 --> 00:00:48,416
constructed under
Arcadian Project supervision.

13
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,250
This calls for some
scouting of the island.

14
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:53,333
I think it'll be worth
our while to do so.

15
00:00:56,875 --> 00:00:59,125
So, they even brought
you along on this, Maya?

16
00:00:59,208 --> 00:01:01,083
That's gotta be
rough on you, huh.

17
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:06,500
Kazuki...

18
00:01:06,583 --> 00:01:09,541
...do you honestly believe that
just because you helped

19
00:01:09,625 --> 00:01:12,291
clean up and
restore Shoko's grave...

20
00:01:12,375 --> 00:01:15,500
...that you've finished
atoning for your sin?

21
00:01:15,583 --> 00:01:17,125
Kazuki!

22
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:25,541
It looks like a lot
of people's memories...

23
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:28,291
...were made here
at this island too.

24
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:29,500
Hey!

25
00:03:30,375 --> 00:03:32,666
Come down before
you get yourself hurt, Maya!

26
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:35,166
Okay, but I'm fine up here!

27
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:05,666
All right, Koyo.

28
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,916
Let's start this by scouting
the one o'clock area now.

29
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:11,666
You don't have any right
to order me around, Kazuki.

30
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:12,708
Enough, Koyo.

31
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:14,958
We're in the middle
of an operation!

32
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:16,875
Operation, huh...?

33
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:22,750
Was that how you justified
abandoning Shoko huh, Soshi?

34
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:28,708
Koyo, listen to me...
Soshi never intended to...

35
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:44,125
The operation seems
to be going smoothly now.

36
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:46,750
I think we're on track
to finish by this evening.

37
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:48,416
Right according to schedule.

38
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,875
And how is that
other operation of ours going?

39
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:53,125
It's currently underway, ma'am.

40
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:00,333
Report your status.

41
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:05,166
It isn't going according
to schedule, is it?

42
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:07,708
Um...
Mr. Mizoguchi...

43
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:10,375
...doesn't know anything about
this operation, does he?

44
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:12,416
Of course he doesn't.

45
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:22,750
Don't worry about him.

46
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:53,333
All right, this is an
old area so be careful!

47
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:53,875
What's going on?

48
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:55,583
What was that?

49
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:03,875
Hey, are you all right?

50
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:06,625
We need a rescue team here!

51
00:06:06,708 --> 00:06:08,333
There's been an accident
in the subhangar!

52
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:10,625
With one injury reported...

53
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:12,625
The other unit's
reporting in now.

54
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:15,000
They've found the entrance!

55
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:21,750
Is it okay if we don't
report this to Mizoguchi?

56
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:23,875
It doesn't matter.
He wouldn't understand.

57
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:25,833
He's too old--fashioned.

58
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:35,125
Hey, what was that sound,
Mr. Mizoguchi?

59
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:36,666
Maya!

60
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:41,750
We're shorthanded.
Please come with me.

61
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:43,958
Sure...

62
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:46,250
Welp, looks like it's time
for you to get workin'!

63
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:47,333
And what about you?

64
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:49,041
Aren't you eager
to start working, too?

65
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:51,500
You youngsters have
worn me out already.

66
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:52,791
Hurry!

67
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,083
What's all this now?

68
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:06,541
I guess I should
start working, too.

69
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:18,666
Sorry, kid, but could you
call another person over?

70
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,958
Sure...
Sorry about that...

71
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:31,791
Target located.

72
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:34,916
Please proceed as
you were instructed to.

73
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,916
The system is still alive...

74
00:08:01,416 --> 00:08:04,708
Mizoguchi from the landing party
is sending us a message.

75
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:06,041
Transfer him to my private line.

76
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:07,750
Understood.

77
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:12,708
How are things going there?

78
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:14,250
The teacher seems
to be hunting around

79
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:17,125
the island for treasure
or something.

80
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:19,625
If it turns out that
she finds anything,

81
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:21,750
can I act independently?

82
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:23,666
Not until we find
out what she's up to.

83
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,916
Nothing until then.

84
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,625
Yes, sir, I understand.

85
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:32,916
Hm?

86
00:08:58,166 --> 00:09:01,833
I am right here...
Tell me, are you there?

87
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:16,000
Please, no...

88
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:22,250
Please don't read my mind...
I beg you...

89
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:27,125
What's wrong?

90
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:40,333
So that's what it is...

91
00:09:40,416 --> 00:09:42,625
I see... you people are
the ones who came from

92
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:44,916
the other invited Alvis...

93
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:47,416
What's wrong?

94
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,625
Commando!
What happened? Report!

95
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:54,083
The core of this place
is no longer present here.

96
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:57,375
That means you are...

97
00:09:57,458 --> 00:10:02,208
I... am you.

98
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:06,541
Someone, help!

99
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:22,375
It's a Solomon prophecy!
The reading is unclear.

100
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:25,083
Several Arfenotheles types--
as well as Grendel types--

101
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:26,291
have been detected!

102
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:27,875
Where are they emerging from?

103
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:29,458
Three hundred
ten kilometers north.

104
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:32,250
The island where the
operation is taking place!

105
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:34,541
What triggered them to attack?

106
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:37,041
We aren't sure
of the cause yet, sir.

107
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:41,666
Retreat immediately!

108
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,666
The enemy has
just shown up here!

109
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,541
All the workers on
the island are in danger!

110
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:57,958
What did you just say?!

111
00:10:58,041 --> 00:11:00,041
Why weren't you able to
detect their presence sooner?!

112
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:03,458
Order the landing party to
retreat from there immediately!

113
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:13,708
Yumiko, tell me!
How's Maya?

114
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:16,291
Please try to calm
down a little, Mom...

115
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:26,541
We need rescue!

116
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:28,416
Hey, is anybody listening?!

117
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,750
Evacuation status.

118
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:31,416
It appears that the workers
and the rescue team

119
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,750
are still currently in
the underground facility.

120
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:35,416
Preparing the
convoy for departure

121
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,041
is our top priority.

122
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:39,000
You're gonna abandon them...?

123
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:41,875
Miss Kariya?

124
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:50,375
That's a scary thought.
Very scary.

125
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:03,458
Huh?

126
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:05,541
Going in to rescue
them all is futile.

127
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:09,333
This is exactly why I hate
rookies tagging along...

128
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:12,666
Babysitting's part
of a grownup's job.

129
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:29,166
Are you ready?

130
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:32,875
Quit being so annoying, Soshi.
Let me out already.

131
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:35,000
LDA is unfolding.

132
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:36,875
Locking Gewitter
units one and two.

133
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:38,708
Locking Gewitter
units three and four.

134
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:40,791
Releasing Fafner cage.

135
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:44,375
Transfer AVC Lindwurm
to the turntable.

136
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:46,000
Move the block.

137
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:53,666
Final safety check all green.

138
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,791
Secure Fafner
to contact position.

139
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:58,041
Lock Contact Arm.

140
00:13:15,791 --> 00:13:18,083
Hurry!
Get away from here!

141
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:26,375
Abandoning my friends is
something that I don't

142
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:29,166
ever intend to
do as long as I live.

143
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:30,875
I'll never do that!

144
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:45,208
I am right here...
Tell me, are you there?

145
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,625
Someone, help!
Help...

146
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:56,875
It looks like the entire special
unit was taken out...

147
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:03,250
This means we don't need to
stay on the island anymore...

148
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:18,625
We've confirmed that
this island also has a Fenrir.

149
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:19,750
I recommend releasing it

150
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:22,041
and destroying the
island immediately.

151
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:26,291
Why are you
hesitating to do this, sir?

152
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:30,041
This is our chance to wipe out
the enemy in a single attack.

153
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:32,791
The evacuation isn't
complete yet is that right?

154
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:34,916
I believe this alternative
is more preferable

155
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,708
than having our
people assimilated.

156
00:14:38,916 --> 00:14:41,708
Permit me to use the Fenrir.

157
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:45,000
I understand.
Permission granted.

158
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:48,125
Commander Makabe...

159
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:51,708
Soshi.

160
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:54,333
I have something
I need you to do.

161
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:15,875
Hang on!
I'm coming to get you!

162
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:19,583
I can get back up by myself.
It's okay...

163
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:30,625
Are you there?

164
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:56,291
I'm glad you're still
alive, little missy.

165
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:58,250
Good work there!

166
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:03,083
This man...
He was here just a minute ago...

167
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:05,958
Looks like the poor bastard
got himself assimilated.

168
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:07,333
Hm?

169
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:11,750
What the heck is this?

170
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:14,666
Who are the people that
are still alive underground?

171
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,500
Mizoguchi, and it looks
like he's heading toward

172
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:19,000
the surface with a
rescue team member.

173
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:22,708
They'll be adequate
sacrificial lambs.

174
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:31,958
Mizoguchi, what is
your current position?

175
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:35,916
We're on the sixth sublevel.
Don't you forget about us, okay?

176
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,333
Please release the
underground Fenrir right away.

177
00:16:38,416 --> 00:16:39,708
Are you serious?

178
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:42,416
I received the order from
Commander Makabe.

179
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,000
I know they used
to call him fearless

180
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:45,500
a long time ago, but still...

181
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:48,208
Who on earth put
that idea into his head?

182
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:51,083
Are you unable to follow
the commander's order?

183
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:53,125
All right, all right,
I'll do it already.

184
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:55,791
Hurry up and gimme
the startup code, will ya?

185
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:12,750
Hey, Soshi!

186
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:15,416
I just found
Fenrir's startup code!

187
00:17:18,916 --> 00:17:20,250
Well, I'm sure
you've guessed we've

188
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:21,625
got a little errand to run.

189
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:22,791
Sorry.

190
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:24,375
Huh?

191
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:31,083
Like I thought...
It's the same...

192
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,666
This must be it then.

193
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:36,083
All right...
Bingo.

194
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:40,166
Please set the starting
time for 30 minutes.

195
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:41,458
30 minutes, huh?

196
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:42,458
Hm?

197
00:17:42,541 --> 00:17:44,083
Isn't that way too fast?

198
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:46,708
Waiting any longer
would be risky.

199
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:49,875
Acknowledged, ma'am.

200
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:51,291
Here we go.

201
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:54,708
Three two one.

202
00:17:56,958 --> 00:17:59,250
Initiating Fenrir.

203
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:02,750
All right, move out.
Let's go.

204
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:15,916
Fenrir is active.

205
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,666
Split into two groups.
One will be on standby.

206
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:21,041
The other will rescue the people
who're still underground.

207
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:22,791
How are we supposed
to get to them?

208
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:23,791
Through the ocean.

209
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:25,333
I'll go!

210
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:28,458
I'm going to accomplish what
the two of you weren't able to!

211
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:34,833
All right then, Koyo...

212
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:37,750
I'll give you your orders now.

213
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:40,291
You want us to start
heading down now?

214
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:43,541
That's the one and only
escape route from there.

215
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,416
Right, I understand.

216
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,416
Did he tell us to
do something reckless?

217
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,833
He finally gave us an order
that's actually worth following.

218
00:18:52,916 --> 00:18:54,875
What if there are
some enemies underwater?

219
00:18:54,958 --> 00:18:56,208
I'll go!

220
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:59,208
I'm giving this order
to Koyo, and that's final.

221
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:05,750
There's no backup.
You're the only one.

222
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:09,041
So I'll tell you this once.

223
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:10,625
Reckless actions
like those Shoko

224
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:13,416
took won't be allowed again.

225
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:23,166
If there's any danger
of losing the Fafner

226
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:25,458
then we'll stop the rescue.

227
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:33,500
You mean that this all
depends on my ability.

228
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:35,250
Soshi, you should
at least check that

229
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:36,791
there's no enemy down there!

230
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:39,416
He's never fought underwater
before, much less in the ocean!

231
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,000
If he gets attacked there...

232
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:44,916
Kazuki fighting them is going
to be your share of the duties.

233
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:49,625
You'll be drawing out our
enemies onto the island.

234
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:12,291
You want me to take this
ship to them, is that right?

235
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:15,500
Right.
Your time limit is 10 minutes.

236
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:21,666
Stop it, Koyo!

237
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:24,833
Are you going to throw the
Fafner away doing this?!

238
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:29,166
Mr. Makabe, will
Maya really be able to return...

239
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:32,791
She'll be all right.
There isn't any need to worry.

240
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:39,833
Damn!

241
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:56,208
Thank goodness.

242
00:20:56,291 --> 00:20:58,250
Are we gonna rest
here for a minute?

243
00:20:58,333 --> 00:21:00,791
Only because we
don't have any weapons.

244
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:09,708
I'll get there soon...

245
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:12,583
And when I do,
I'll be ready to fight.

246
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:25,875
If you destroy that, the rest of
the enemies will go after you.

247
00:21:25,958 --> 00:21:26,875
Got it?

248
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:28,291
Yes, sir!

249
00:21:29,333 --> 00:21:31,750
I want you to launch the
landing craft immediately.

250
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:33,166
But the survivors are still...

251
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,333
I just gave you an order!

252
00:22:08,541 --> 00:22:09,916
Fire now!

253
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:18,583
All that we wanted was to
overcome the sadness.

254
00:22:18,666 --> 00:22:20,083
We were on the verge
of doing something

255
00:22:20,166 --> 00:22:22,958
that we had never done before.

256
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:26,541
And with that we kept telling
ourselves that we could heal...

257
00:22:26,625 --> 00:22:28,583
...that we could...

258
00:22:28,666 --> 00:22:33,041
But instead we sank
deeper into darkness.

259
00:22:34,041 --> 00:22:39,000
♪ closing song ♪

260
00:23:40,083 --> 00:23:42,500
Sinking Fafner.

261
00:23:42,583 --> 00:23:44,625
Frozen heart.

262
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:48,208
Hey, Koyo...

263
00:23:48,708 --> 00:23:51,166
Open your eyes...

264
00:23:51,708 --> 00:23:56,291
Next on Fafner
episode number nine.

265
00:23:56,375 --> 00:23:57,791
"Parting."

266
00:23:58,791 --> 00:24:00,875
Are you there?
