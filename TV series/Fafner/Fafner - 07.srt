1
00:00:16,166 --> 00:00:19,208
You've got to help
me stop Shoko!

2
00:00:23,583 --> 00:00:25,750
Get off the island!
Go away!

3
00:00:25,833 --> 00:00:27,750
This is Kazuki's island!

4
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:42,083
What do you think you're doing?

5
00:00:42,166 --> 00:00:45,166
I am trying to...
draw it away from the island.

6
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:46,833
You need to eject!
Now Shoko!

7
00:00:46,916 --> 00:00:48,625
Initiating Fenrir.

8
00:00:48,708 --> 00:00:50,000
Kazuki...

9
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:54,500
Don't worry.
I will protect your island...

10
00:00:58,041 --> 00:01:00,166
No, it can't be!

11
00:01:05,291 --> 00:01:10,250
♪ opening song ♪

12
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:41,750
These two are the ones who
can be made battle-ready?

13
00:02:41,833 --> 00:02:44,625
Yes, just barely though...

14
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:48,250
Your response speed
is going up nicely.

15
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:51,125
You shouldn't force yourself
to unite with Fafner.

16
00:02:51,208 --> 00:02:53,916
Let's take our time
and do it little by little.

17
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,041
After all, it's not like you
need to rush out into battle.

18
00:02:57,125 --> 00:02:59,750
I think that I've
had enough training now.

19
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:02,125
I have a favor to ask of you.

20
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,250
I'm afraid I can't allow it.

21
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:09,916
I don't see why you can't.

22
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,125
I happen to be in agreement
with Koyo's suggestion.

23
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:13,500
Absolutely not.

24
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:16,041
There are limits to what
the simulations show.

25
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:17,750
That's neither here nor there...

26
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:19,500
It's meaningless if he
can't demonstrate

27
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:21,458
his power in actual combat.

28
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:22,750
He needs to have training that

29
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:25,458
will ensure his
survival in battle.

30
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:30,041
Work notice to
all hangar personnel.

31
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:32,791
Due to the elimination
of Mark Zex,

32
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:34,833
work shifts have been moved up.

33
00:03:35,458 --> 00:03:38,125
Be sure to confirm your
duties at each section.

34
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:39,458
Repeat.

35
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:40,875
Due to the elimination
of Mark Zex--

36
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:43,458
Man, she caused a lot
of problems doin' what she did.

37
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:46,125
Yeah, just look at what happened
to the precious Mark Zex.

38
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:47,333
Pilots ought to put themselves

39
00:03:47,416 --> 00:03:50,000
in mechanic's
shoes once in awhile.

40
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:41,458
So... Then in other words,
what you're saying is

41
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:44,083
you won't hand over
the Nothung model to us...

42
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:46,541
We've already lost one
Fafner in the process of

43
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:48,708
defending the Neo U.N. convoy.

44
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:52,333
There isn't anything left to
relinquish to you people.

45
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:54,041
However...

46
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:55,625
Are you trying
to turn this island

47
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:58,291
into a scapegoat like Japan?

48
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:01,916
We can't sacrifice anymore
than we already have.

49
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,666
Excuse me.

50
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:06,750
Hmph.

51
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:12,541
Somehow... I find
it really hard to believe

52
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:15,375
that Shoko isn't
around anymore...

53
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:16,916
It feels like she
just transferred

54
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,416
to another school
or something...

55
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,541
Thinking that way makes
it easier, doesn't it?

56
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:22,916
Sakura...

57
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:26,708
Well then how should
I think about it, huh?

58
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:30,750
Shoko fought, and she was
satisfied to die doing it.

59
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:31,666
That's how.

60
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,958
You can't really mean that...

61
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,750
Humph.

62
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:49,125
And when the time comes, are we
supposed to do the same thing?

63
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,041
You should have been
able to save her, Kazuki!

64
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:07,708
You were piloting a
Fafner, weren't you?!

65
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:09,291
Then why didn't you?!

66
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:11,375
It was impossible under
those circumstances.

67
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:13,541
But you should've been able
to do something, right?!

68
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:14,625
You could've saved her!

69
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,791
It was just you
who came out alive...

70
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:18,958
Does that sound
all right to you?

71
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:20,833
How can you ever expect
me to believe that

72
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:23,291
saving her was impossible?

73
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:27,583
In the end...
Shoko suffered...

74
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:29,833
She suffered and died...

75
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:33,791
But only we...
Only we survived...

76
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:46,916
The death of Shoko Hazama
was most unfortunate...

77
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,333
...but it's imperative
now that we move

78
00:06:48,416 --> 00:06:51,333
forward with the
Arcadian Project.

79
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:53,291
Yes.

80
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:56,958
The Albelihide organization
is prepared to offer

81
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:59,250
you the next child
that needs to be raised.

82
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:01,541
Are you considering accepting?

83
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:04,541
Even if...

84
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,291
Even if...

85
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:08,583
I didn't actually
give birth to her...

86
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:11,666
Shoko is my daughter
and always will be.

87
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:14,083
Yes... and, regarding
that subject...

88
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:16,875
She's my one and only daughter!

89
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:21,541
Yes, I understand...

90
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:30,541
Hello, Kasugai residence.

91
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:33,166
Huh?
You want Koyo?

92
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:34,541
Yes...

93
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:37,041
Yes.
One moment please.

94
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:41,416
Hello, this is Koyo.

95
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:43,125
Yes...

96
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:45,083
Yes.

97
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:48,958
Yes, I understand.

98
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:50,708
What was that?

99
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:53,416
Tomorrow, I want you
and dad to come with me.

100
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,708
Huh?

101
00:07:57,166 --> 00:08:01,500
Temperature, 26 degrees Celsius.
Humidity, 87 percent.

102
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:03,916
Wind direction south
by southeast.

103
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,583
Visibility is poor.

104
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:09,333
Please be sure to confirm your
positions and avoid collisions.

105
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:11,750
Can we please start already?

106
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,291
Are you sure that
we can really do this?

107
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:15,916
As real as we
can with this ammo.

108
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,125
I won't be taking it
easy on you either, Kazuki.

109
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:22,333
All Fafner pilots, please
confirm to us once more that

110
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:23,750
your entire
complement of bullets

111
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:25,333
consists of paint pellets.

112
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:27,333
Mark Elf, confirmation complete.

113
00:08:27,416 --> 00:08:28,708
Mark Vier, confirmed.

114
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:30,500
Mark Drei, confirmed.

115
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:32,458
Then we'll begin at Stage 1.

116
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,083
Mark Vier and Mark Drei are to

117
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:36,458
head from point
zero to point one.

118
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:39,666
Mark Elf is to attack
them after three minutes.

119
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:42,208
The time limit is 15 minutes.

120
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:43,416
--Roger!
--Roger!

121
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,666
Training begins now.

122
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:55,708
You're doing very well so far.

123
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:56,833
Thanks for noticing.

124
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:58,958
Now he's after you too.

125
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:02,625
He's behind and to the left.
Contact in 28 seconds.

126
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:04,875
Get in control of
your emotions, Koyo.

127
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:06,333
or your response
time will slow down.

128
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:08,125
I know, Soshi.

129
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:10,625
Their pulse and heart
rates are slightly elevated.

130
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:13,125
But they're within the
normal range considering

131
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:16,166
that this is their
first piloting mission.

132
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:41,458
That concludes Stage 1.

133
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:44,541
Stage 2 will begin after
a 20-minute break.

134
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:57,166
That concludes Stage 2.
Stage 3 begins now.

135
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,000
What a difference.

136
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:02,666
They were at
approximately the same

137
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:05,041
level when they
started the training...

138
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:08,041
Shall we continue then?

139
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:37,166
This really didn't show
what I'm capable of at all.

140
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:38,833
I know that it didn't.

141
00:10:38,916 --> 00:10:40,916
However, Sakura...

142
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:44,375
If you ever feel you're in
danger, please run away.

143
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:46,166
Even if it means
disobeying orders.

144
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:47,666
Eh?

145
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:51,000
I don't want what happened
to Shoko to happen to you too.

146
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:56,833
Dying isn't what I want!

147
00:10:57,916 --> 00:11:00,000
But I won't run.

148
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:02,916
I want to take down
as many as I can...

149
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,875
As many of those
enemies who killed Dad...

150
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:15,625
I guess my power was pretty
disappointing, wasn't it...

151
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:16,916
It's all right...

152
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,500
Just finding out
what your potential

153
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:21,291
is makes all this a success.

154
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:25,250
Well then...

155
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:27,000
...it looks like
everything's over now.

156
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:28,375
Huh?

157
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:33,541
Okay... let's go to
the medical room.

158
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:43,208
Couldn't you do
anything to prevent this?

159
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:50,041
If it had been a real battle,
this would've been a casket...

160
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:51,833
Someone made a good shot.

161
00:11:51,916 --> 00:11:53,208
Huh?

162
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:58,125
Yeah, you're right!

163
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:11,625
I knew this was
going to happen...

164
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:13,000
But...

165
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:17,583
But still...

166
00:12:17,666 --> 00:12:19,416
We put the children
into this position,

167
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,125
and we make them
go into battle all

168
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:23,875
for the sake of
our own survival...

169
00:12:27,541 --> 00:12:28,958
I can't...

170
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:32,500
I just can't
understand it at all...

171
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:43,000
I'm sorry for the wait.

172
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:46,000
We detected a change
in his chromosomes

173
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:47,875
as we thought we would.

174
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:52,208
Aren't you two
feeling concerned at all?

175
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:55,333
Not particularly.
Isn't that right, dear?

176
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:58,333
Well, we are
Albelihide people, after all.

177
00:12:58,416 --> 00:13:00,708
The job we agreed
to do is over now.

178
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:02,208
We're different from
your family, you know,

179
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:03,458
and the Kanames, too.

180
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:05,583
How can you
say things like that?

181
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:07,375
Like the Hazamas,
we weren't able to

182
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:09,833
have any children of our own.

183
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:11,625
We couldn't join
the project unless we

184
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:13,541
accepted this job
as part of the deal.

185
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:16,166
Mrs. Hazama would
never do something like that!

186
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:18,583
But don't forget that that
daughter of hers was a hit!

187
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:21,250
She actually destroyed an enemy.

188
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:25,416
Whereas our "son"
is a total miss.

189
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:28,041
A total miss...?

190
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:50,750
This is the island that we found

191
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:53,458
three hundred fifty
kilometers to the north.

192
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:57,750
It certainly looks similar.

193
00:13:57,833 --> 00:14:00,458
You mean...
that it looks similar to Alvis?

194
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:03,458
Alvis isn't the only island
that was constructed

195
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:05,708
under the Arcadian
Project's supervision.

196
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:07,916
But intelligence regarding
the other islands was

197
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,208
unfortunately something that
was never fully disclosed to us.

198
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:13,375
In any case, no matter
what this island was

199
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:17,166
protecting someone's going
to have to take it over.

200
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,750
However, we don't
know whether this

201
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:20,791
island was part of
the Arcadian Project.

202
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:22,708
This calls for some
scouting of the island.

203
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:25,666
I think it'll be worth
our while to do so.

204
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:30,625
It's important for us to find
out what happened here.

205
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:33,291
Send in the research unit
along with some Fafners.

206
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:35,625
I'll leave personnel
selection to you.

207
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,625
I understand, Commander.

208
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:40,541
Excuse me...

209
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:43,416
But why was I assigned
to the scouting team?

210
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,791
I heard that our medical
unit was shorthanded.

211
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:48,041
And I believe that you
have some first aid skills.

212
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:49,791
But wait...

213
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:02,583
Please stop doing that, Dad...

214
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:04,041
Stupid little stray mutt!

215
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:05,875
Dad, please!

216
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:08,208
Chocolat!
Dad don't...

217
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:11,125
We don't have any extra food in
the house to feed a dog, Koyo!

218
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:14,541
I'll share my food with her,
so please let the dog stay!

219
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:17,250
Stop focusing on such
pointless things!

220
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,666
All you need to worry
about is being a pilot!

221
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:22,208
Now hurry up and
get rid of that thing!

222
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:38,250
Thanks, Chocolat...
you're a good girl.

223
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:48,333
Koyo?

224
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,166
Maya...

225
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,416
Oh, look, it's so cute!

226
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:54,666
Does it have a name?

227
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,916
Eh?
Oh, uh...

228
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,375
No, she doesn't for now, anyway.

229
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:03,791
It's so adorable...

230
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:07,041
Hey, about tomorrow...

231
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:09,541
You're gonna be going out with
us on the mission too, right?

232
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:12,791
Huh?
Yeah...

233
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:14,708
I have no idea why, though...

234
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:16,958
It seems it's already
been decided.

235
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:23,166
Hm?
What's the matter?

236
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:25,541
Oh, nothing really.

237
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:36,833
Nobody's home...

238
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:41,083
Oh, wait...
Let's go to Mamoru's house.

239
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:42,958
He has to be home.

240
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:50,166
Sorry, I can't keep
a dog around here...

241
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:51,500
I see...

242
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:53,625
I'm real sorry about that.

243
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:02,250
Must've been tough
out there in the rain.

244
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:03,666
A little bit.

245
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:07,000
Uh, actually, I have a
small favor I'd like to ask...

246
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,708
Oh, those little guys used to
be some specimens for research.

247
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:17,416
So what was
the favor you wanted?

248
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:21,083
N-Never mind, it's all right.

249
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,833
So what now, Chocolat?

250
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:36,333
How about...
we go on Fafner together?

251
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:48,500
Koyo?

252
00:17:57,041 --> 00:17:58,375
About that mission tomorrow...

253
00:17:58,458 --> 00:18:00,833
Have you heard
anything about it yet?

254
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:02,125
Yeah...

255
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:10,208
All right.
See you then.

256
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:17,000
Hey... do you like dogs?

257
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:18,291
Huh?

258
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:22,041
I heard that my dad had a
dog once a long time ago...

259
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:24,958
You think you could...

260
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:25,666
What?

261
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:28,375
Uh... Nevermind...

262
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:30,333
Koyo.

263
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:35,083
Um... don't catch a cold.
That goes for both of you.

264
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:06,250
Oh, Koyo?

265
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:10,458
Thanks for everything.

266
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:11,833
Huh?

267
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:39,250
Why did you choose
Kazuki and Koyo?

268
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:41,666
You think I'm incompetent
or something, Soshi?!

269
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:44,083
Actually, I don't
think that at all.

270
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:45,416
However, you
haven't forgotten what

271
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:48,125
happened to the
Mark Zex, have you?

272
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:51,708
Back then, if we had left a
Fafner and an able pilot here to

273
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:55,416
defend the island the incident
wouldn't have happened.

274
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,375
I've been thinking that we
should always leave a suitable

275
00:19:57,458 --> 00:20:00,583
pilot behind just in case
something like that happens.

276
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:03,625
Well, I'm willing to
leave it at that for now.

277
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:05,583
Thank you, Sakura.

278
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,916
How's the little dog doing?

279
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,333
Yeah, she's doing
just fine, thanks.

280
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:18,916
Here you go.

281
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:26,125
I wanted to thank you...

282
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:27,625
...you were the one
who took the time to

283
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:29,291
clean up Shoko's
grave, weren't you?

284
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:30,666
Huh?

285
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:34,166
I wasn't the only one, actually.

286
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:42,000
Kazuki and Soshi were
there and they helped me too.

287
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:47,875
Huh?
Is something the matter?

288
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:04,250
So they even brought
you along on this, Maya?

289
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:06,291
That's gotta
be rough on you.

290
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:10,333
Uh, will you be okay,
Mr. Mizoguchi?

291
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:12,500
Yeah, I'll be okay
after a little drink or two.

292
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:15,125
This is just like goin'
fishing, after all.

293
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:15,958
Here ya go.

294
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:18,416
Oh, t-thanks...

295
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:21,041
It's when the tide's about
to change direction that

296
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:24,041
you can usually catch the big
ones, in case you didn't know.

297
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:25,375
Oh...

298
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:27,583
And you can't fish
when you're sober.

299
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:29,041
Okay...

300
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:31,916
Our ultimate goal here
is to secure materials.

301
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,041
But the island's defense system

302
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,708
isn't necessarily
completely inactive.

303
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:39,500
That's why we have the Fafners
available as a last resort.

304
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:43,000
I'm counting on both of you.

305
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:48,791
We're about to reach the
target island's airspace.

306
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:52,750
Kazuki...

307
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:55,666
...do you honestly believe
that just because you helped

308
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:58,291
clean up and
restore Shoko's grave...

309
00:21:58,375 --> 00:22:01,375
...that you've finished
atoning for your sin?

310
00:22:01,458 --> 00:22:02,458
Kazuki!

311
00:22:02,541 --> 00:22:04,916
Your emotions are
in disarray, Koyo.

312
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:08,291
Don't think of things now.

313
00:22:08,375 --> 00:22:10,291
Focus on your duties.

314
00:22:10,875 --> 00:22:13,125
We've arrived at the target!

315
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,541
Even though we
had just won a battle...

316
00:22:19,625 --> 00:22:22,375
...we didn't feel the usual joy.

317
00:22:23,083 --> 00:22:27,750
Instead we felt
the loss of our friend.

318
00:22:27,833 --> 00:22:32,791
And just dealing with that
was all anyone could do.

319
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:38,708
♪ closing song ♪

320
00:23:35,291 --> 00:23:37,416
You abandoned Shoko?

321
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:40,500
Eyes clouded with sorrow.

322
00:23:40,583 --> 00:23:42,958
Hearts that pass one another.
