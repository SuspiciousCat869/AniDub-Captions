2
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,625
I just need to hear
the answer for myself.

3
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:50,416
Between Fafner
or the rest of us,

4
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,791
when it comes down to it,
which one's more important?

5
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,416
It would be Fafner.

6
00:02:02,291 --> 00:02:05,666
You sure have changed.
You know that?

7
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,708
The one who's not
willing to change...

8
00:02:07,791 --> 00:02:09,500
...is you, Kazuki.

9
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,250
Are you there?

10
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:20,208
Have one shred of
doubt about the battle

11
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:23,041
and you will for sure
be its next victim.

12
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:26,750
You should try and forget
about Shoko and Koyo.

13
00:02:26,833 --> 00:02:28,125
You're not...

14
00:02:28,208 --> 00:02:30,708
You're not being
serious, are you?

15
00:02:32,625 --> 00:02:34,625
I'll tell you what I
need from you right now.

16
00:02:34,708 --> 00:02:38,416
What I need is someone who can
act as if they were my left eye.

17
00:02:52,083 --> 00:02:53,416
So, how did you like my work?

18
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,625
I did all right today
didn't I, Maya?

19
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:58,250
Well I thought you did a
pretty good job today.

20
00:02:58,333 --> 00:02:59,625
I'm so glad.

21
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:02,083
I'll be sure to keep on
working harder from now on.

22
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:04,166
Good for you, Rina.

23
00:03:05,416 --> 00:03:07,250
Because I'm determined
to be a good pilot.

24
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:09,541
I'm not selfish like Shoko.

25
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:14,500
What?
What do you mean by that?

26
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:16,000
Huh?

27
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:17,750
Well I had heard that Shoko
ignored direct orders and as

28
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:21,500
a result of that the Mark Zex
ended up getting destroyed.

29
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:24,458
Who would say such a thing?
Where did you hear that?

30
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:27,791
Well...
they all say it.

31
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:30,500
You have no idea about anything!

32
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:34,291
Wait, Maya.
What's the matter?

33
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:35,625
Please wait a minute.

34
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:37,750
Please don't go yet.

35
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:51,083
Are you there?

36
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:53,041
I wish I knew.

37
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:58,708
The truth is, you are
not here, Kazuki.

38
00:03:58,791 --> 00:04:02,708
No because you are nothing
like the rest of them here.

39
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,333
I overheard your
conversation with Soshi...

40
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:10,458
...about his left eye...

41
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:15,875
It was me.
I was the one who did it.

42
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:20,041
When I was little.
Right here.

43
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:22,500
This is where
he lost his left eye.

44
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:24,750
And it was cuz of me.

45
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:34,625
I wonder, why did
I do such a thing?

46
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:39,875
I guess, I just wanted to try to
be his eye so badly that...

47
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:42,125
...but. I...

48
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:44,750
Perhaps you aren't able
to keep up with him...

49
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:46,291
It makes me wonder.

50
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:49,958
It's only natural...
after all...

51
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:52,583
...he knows what it's
like in the outside world.

52
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:54,958
The world beyond this island?

53
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:16,791
Dad?
Are you here?

54
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:34,291
Do you know where
Commander Makabe is?

55
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:35,916
The Commander?

56
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,291
Oh.

57
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:38,916
Your father is in a meeting
with Soshi right now.

58
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,291
Huh?

59
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:43,125
Is something wrong?

60
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:44,583
Do you want me
to page him for you?

61
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:47,291
No.
It's all right.

62
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,458
It was you.

63
00:06:00,541 --> 00:06:03,208
You called me here
that time, didn't you?

64
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:07,583
I thought you wanted me
to fight alongside Soshi.

65
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:10,708
But is that what you
really want me to do?

66
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:15,458
What did he see?
In the outside world?

67
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,916
What could have made him change?

68
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:25,333
Sis!

69
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:27,916
The rumors about
Shoko are just awful!

70
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,125
I know and I'm sorry.
But there's nothing we can do.

71
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:33,541
We can't control
what people think.

72
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:36,125
But Shoko did everything
to protect the island.

73
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:39,500
Rumors are like that.
It's best to just ignore them.

74
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:43,291
Excuse me, Miss Yumiko.
can you come here?

75
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:44,666
Huh?

76
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,500
What's going on?
What on earth happened?

77
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:51,333
One of the students has decided

78
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:53,500
to lock himself
inside of the studio.

79
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:55,541
Huh?
What student was it?

80
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:57,875
An eighth grader
named Hiroto Douma.

81
00:06:57,958 --> 00:06:59,875
I think he's in
Miss Kaname's class.

82
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:01,208
Uh...
'Scuse me.

83
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:02,833
Hi, I'm Hiroto's father.

84
00:07:02,916 --> 00:07:04,958
I didn't expect things
to turn out like this...

85
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:06,000
What do you mean?

86
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:07,458
Do you know
what made him do this?

87
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:09,666
Well you see... we
were discussing what

88
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,708
he would be
doing after graduation.

89
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:14,791
Why Miss Kaname,

90
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:18,166
he's going to be taking over
my restaurant of course!

91
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:20,250
Mr. Douma, that is
only secondary

92
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:22,000
to his real obligations.

93
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:24,208
This survey we're
conducting is to find out what

94
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:27,041
he wishes to do
as his primary duties.

95
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:30,166
It doesn't matter as
long as he's not a pilot.

96
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,791
Miss Kaname, Do you think
it would be difficult for him

97
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:35,416
to join the maintenance
crew on Takeru Island?

98
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,625
We will need to verify whether
he's suitable for that position.

99
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,750
I'm currently
assigned to the hanger.

100
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:42,875
I would sure prefer it
if he were able to work

101
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:45,625
in a safe environment
like me, you know?

102
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:47,041
Yes...

103
00:07:47,458 --> 00:07:51,708
Hiroto, Is there somewhere
specific you'd like to work?

104
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:54,666
Listen, Can I be
honest with you here?

105
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,416
Of course.

106
00:07:57,833 --> 00:07:58,916
In Tokyo!

107
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,083
That's where I
really want to work!

108
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:04,500
I want to go to Tokyo
and be a superstar!

109
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:05,750
Yeah!

110
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:08,083
I'll perform in concerts
or even appear on a...

111
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:10,458
Fine I guess I'll
have to decide for you.

112
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:12,291
And I know just the place...

113
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:14,666
...on the thirteenth
floor below Alvis.

114
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:18,166
The thirteenth floor?
What's there to do there?

115
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:20,875
You can wash uniforms!
How does that sound?

116
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:22,833
No!

117
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,791
And this is a result of that?

118
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:30,458
Despite his looks,
Hiroto can be pretty sensitive.

119
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:31,541
Yes, I see.

120
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:32,916
You could have
shown a bit more

121
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,166
consideration
wouldn't you agree?

122
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,750
Of course, you're right.

123
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:38,291
And you would
understand since you went

124
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:39,833
through a similar situation.

125
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:41,750
Didn't you, Miss Yumiko?

126
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,458
As I recall, some girl
wanted to become an idol.

127
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:47,750
And so she climbed to
the top of the lighthouse,

128
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:49,125
isn't that right?

129
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:52,000
I will go to Tokyo
and become an idol!

130
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:55,083
I will!

131
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,958
Hey Sis, did you
actually do all that?

132
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,541
Stop talking about it!

133
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:04,291
Hiroto, hurry up and
come out of there!

134
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:07,083
Let's discuss this properly
with the teachers.

135
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:09,666
I don't have
anything to discuss.

136
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:12,791
Everyone!
Listen up!

137
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:15,291
Ask yourselves this...
why should we have

138
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:18,125
to carry on with
the Arcadian Project?

139
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:19,875
I know that voice...

140
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:21,416
Is it Hiroto?

141
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:24,583
--Huh?
--Just now... what was that?

142
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:25,958
Hey come on you guys.

143
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:27,833
Try and stay focused here!

144
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:35,583
It's not...

145
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:37,500
It's not fair...

146
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:42,458
I want my innocence back!
Give it back to me!

147
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,125
Give my innocence back to me!

148
00:09:57,416 --> 00:09:59,500
Wait a second.
Are you done already?

149
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:00,500
Do you know what?

150
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:02,625
It looks to me
like it's my turn.

151
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:04,625
What the heck are you saying?

152
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:08,500
Come on, Sis I thought you knew
my position on this already.

153
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:09,625
Huh?

154
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:11,750
Hey!

155
00:10:13,416 --> 00:10:15,291
Mamoru, you better stay
right where you are

156
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:16,958
and finish your homework,
you got that?!

157
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:18,000
Kenji!

158
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:19,791
There's no running
in the hall way!

159
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:21,208
Hey wait for me!

160
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:23,666
I wanna go with you guys too!

161
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:25,666
What should we do?

162
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:28,375
What should we do?

163
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:31,208
Excuse me, teachers!

164
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,000
Oh! Kenji.

165
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:35,208
If you would please, just
leave everything to me.

166
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:38,000
After all I am the president
of the student council.

167
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:39,333
Huh?
Wait a minute.

168
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:41,791
Isn't Soshi the president
of the student council?

169
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:43,250
You're wrong!
I am.

170
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:44,083
Mom!

171
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:45,500
That's weird.

172
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:47,083
I was under the impression
that it was Soshi as well.

173
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:48,458
Uh...

174
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:50,208
Come to think of it,
Soshi's really the class rep,

175
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:52,291
and Kenji's the student
council president.

176
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:53,458
Really?

177
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:55,166
I always thought Soshi
was president too.

178
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:56,916
I can't believe you guys!

179
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,250
Well, I guess you can
do what you want then.

180
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:01,791
Not that I would have
faith in whatever it is.

181
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:11,041
Hey...

182
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:12,458
Hiroto Douma.

183
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:13,750
This is Kenji Kondo,

184
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:16,291
the president of the
student council.

185
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:20,625
What do you want,
idiot son of Mrs. Kondo?

186
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:22,791
Idiot?

187
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:25,291
I'm not the one who locked
myself in a classroom!

188
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:30,500
As your senior in life,
there's something important

189
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:31,916
I want to say to you.

190
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,666
In order to live on this island,
each one of us must...

191
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,041
Hey, Kenji.

192
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:38,416
Seri told me
something interesting.

193
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,916
Know what she said?

194
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,125
She told me you tell girls you
killed Festum with Fafner.

195
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:45,083
And that's how you try
to pick up girls, right?

196
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:47,000
Is that really true?

197
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:47,833
Uh-huh.

198
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:49,291
He's the worst.

199
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,458
But you know what?

200
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:52,791
You've never fought
in Fafner, have you?

201
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:54,333
That's the truth, isn't it?

202
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:57,666
I'm afraid that's not
very manly of you, Kenji.

203
00:11:58,291 --> 00:12:00,208
But I have fought in a Fafner!

204
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:02,541
So what if it was
just a simulation?

205
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:03,875
Good grief.

206
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:06,041
Whose bright idea was it
to make him the president?

207
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:09,708
Unfortunately, he was the only
one who ran for the presidency.

208
00:12:09,791 --> 00:12:12,000
Oh, that's right.
I remember now.

209
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:14,291
He's such an idiot!

210
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:18,541
Listen, Hiroto!
Think about it!

211
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:20,250
Do you really believe
you have what it

212
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:22,458
actually takes to
become a superstar?

213
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:24,291
How am I supposed
to know if I don't ever

214
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:26,916
get the chance to get
off of this island!

215
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,291
The teachers, my Dad,

216
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:31,875
and the rest of the
adults here are all liars!

217
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:34,708
How can I believe
anything liars say!

218
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:48,166
I know I'll probably
never become a star.

219
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:49,666
But still...

220
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,208
I just...

221
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,333
I hate the fact that
we're not allowed

222
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:56,041
to ever set foot
off this island.

223
00:12:57,125 --> 00:12:59,625
Because...
for some reason...

224
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:02,416
I feel like I'm
trapped in a cage.

225
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:04,875
And just once...

226
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:07,333
I would like to
see the outside world.

227
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:10,250
Because I...

228
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:11,583
I...

229
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,708
I have something that I want to

230
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:16,250
do that's always been
important to me...

231
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:18,666
After all, there's a sign that's
hanging in our classroom...

232
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:20,791
it has "Hope" written on it.

233
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:27,708
We apologize for keeping
so many secrets from you!

234
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:28,875
But there was a reason.

235
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:30,291
It was because we wanted to make

236
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:33,416
sure that you understood
the importance of peace!

237
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,041
Before living on this island,

238
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:38,500
all any of us knew was
the tragedy from wars.

239
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:39,708
And we're so glad...

240
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:40,916
...that you have
something more you

241
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,375
want to do with your
life or become.

242
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:45,208
Because none of
us adults could afford

243
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:47,583
to have those kinds
of hopes and dreams.

244
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:50,083
But not now you need to focus on

245
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:52,416
surviving before
you can do that.

246
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,250
You children represent hope.

247
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,916
Do you understand
what I'm trying to tell you?

248
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,250
You are our hope and our future.

249
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:02,083
We want you to live
to inherit the island!

250
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:25,291
I'm really sorry...
for all the trouble.

251
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:29,375
Come on in everyone,
welcome, welcome.

252
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:32,958
I've got it all.
Mackerel, sardines, tuna...

253
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:35,083
Say, which one of
these fish tastes the best?

254
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:37,750
Everything is fresh because
it was caught in Barnzveck.

255
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:39,208
They all taste good.

256
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:40,791
So you can have your pick.

257
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:44,041
Well then I guess the question
would be, which one I can cook.

258
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:47,208
Well since you're gonna be
the one cooking Maya...

259
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:50,166
I guess they'd all be
a bit difficult to make.

260
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,166
Hey!

261
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:59,500
You ditched school
today, didn't you?

262
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:00,916
I had things to do...

263
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,291
...at Alvis.

264
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:05,041
I'm just on my way home
to make some dinner.

265
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:07,041
What are you up
to tonight?

266
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:08,625
I probably won't eat.

267
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:09,750
Huh?

268
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:11,833
I don't really
feel like cooking...

269
00:15:11,916 --> 00:15:13,250
...not today.

270
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:14,333
Then I have an idea.

271
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:15,875
Why don't you come over?

272
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:17,416
Huh?

273
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:22,708
Here.
Have a taste.

274
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,333
This is no good at all.

275
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:28,500
Hey uh...

276
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:30,000
...is there anything
I can help out with?

277
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:33,083
No. No.
You're supposed to be a guest.

278
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:34,208
Okay.

279
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:36,500
Oh, sweet sis!
Will you help me out?

280
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:38,541
Please. Please.

281
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:41,750
Well I guess I
don't have a choice.

282
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:44,416
Aaah!
Don't put that in!

283
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,750
Um...
then what about this?

284
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:48,708
No. No.
Make soup stock first.

285
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:51,375
So...
you invited Kazuki...

286
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:52,541
What's with that?

287
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:53,208
Huh?

288
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:54,041
No reason.

289
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:55,291
It was nothing special.

290
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:56,750
Hmm?

291
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:59,208
It appears to me that
my little sister likes

292
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:02,125
Kazuki rather than
Soshi, am I right?

293
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:03,458
Hey now!
Cut it out!

294
00:16:03,541 --> 00:16:04,958
Don't get any funny ideas!

295
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:06,500
Uh...

296
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:08,125
You sure I don't need to come
in and lend you guys a hand?

297
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:09,875
Ah! No. It's okay.

298
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:10,708
Never mind us.

299
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:12,208
Just wait there.

300
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:13,750
Okay.

301
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:17,041
I know what you're thinking and
it has nothing to do with it!

302
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:18,333
Mm-hmm...

303
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:20,958
Oh, hi.

304
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:23,875
Hello.
Good evening.

305
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:25,375
Welcome, Kazuki...

306
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:28,291
Were you ever able to meet
with your father earlier?

307
00:16:29,041 --> 00:16:30,250
Yeah.

308
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:31,625
I see.

309
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:33,875
Okay guys, dig in!

310
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:35,875
--Bon apetit everyone!
--Bon apetit everyone!

311
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:38,583
Hey Kazuki,
aren't you going to eat?

312
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:40,250
Oh right.
Thank you.

313
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:45,250
So?
How's it taste?

314
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:47,000
Mm.
It's real good.

315
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:48,166
I'm so glad.

316
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,250
That means all my
hard work was worth it.

317
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:51,833
Why my goodness, Maya.

318
00:16:51,916 --> 00:16:54,833
This fish cake soup
tastes just like my recipe.

319
00:16:58,666 --> 00:16:59,916
Well that concludes today's

320
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,291
broadcast of
Tatsumiya Island news.

321
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:03,791
And coming up next,

322
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:05,708
we are departing from our
regular scheduled programming,

323
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:08,458
to present you a very
special concert.

324
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:19,875
Yeay!

325
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:23,583
Good evening everyone.
I'm Hiroto Douma.

326
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:27,000
What in the world?

327
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:30,208
Well don't look at me.

328
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:33,166
Yeah...!

329
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:40,541
Thank you for everything.
I appreciate it.

330
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:41,333
You're welcome.

331
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:42,541
It was nothing.

332
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:46,625
Hey Kazuki,
did you hear about it yet?

333
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:48,833
The rumor about Shoko?

334
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:53,083
No but...
I can pretty much guess it.

335
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:56,416
'Cause you know...
about both Shoko and Koyo...

336
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,666
They always fought so hard...

337
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,791
It doesn't matter
what other people say.

338
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:03,625
It doesn't matter at all.

339
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:05,000
We know the truth.

340
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:07,750
Because we'll always
remember how they really were.

341
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:10,250
I know.
You're right but...

342
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:16,000
Hey Maya, what about me?
Will you remember what I'm like?

343
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:16,833
Kazuki?

344
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:18,500
What are you talking about?

345
00:18:18,583 --> 00:18:20,375
Are you saying that you think

346
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:22,666
you're going to
end up like Shoko?

347
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:23,708
No.

348
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:26,083
I'm pretty sure
I'll be all right.

349
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:28,041
But still...

350
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:29,375
Still what?

351
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:31,375
I'm just worried that over time

352
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:33,000
I might get too
used to fighting.

353
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:34,750
And it scares me.

354
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:36,333
'Cuz you see...

355
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:38,083
I feel like I'm
already gradually

356
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:40,458
changing into
something different.

357
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:46,791
I think that...
everyone's been feeling uneasy.

358
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:50,083
Ever since that day...
when Festum attacked us.

359
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:52,708
And we discovered that
the place we trusted in

360
00:18:52,791 --> 00:18:57,625
was just a fake, I
guess we all felt betrayed.

361
00:18:57,708 --> 00:18:59,875
And nothing's been
the same since.

362
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:03,500
I don't think any of us
will remain unchanged.

363
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:04,875
It's okay.

364
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:08,458
We all have to go on living
on this island don't we?

365
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:12,750
So you see, that's why...

366
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:16,333
Oh, Maya...

367
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:17,500
Don't worry...

368
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:21,125
it doesn't matter if
you change; Kazuki,

369
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:22,625
I will always remember you.

370
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:24,458
I promise I will.

371
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:27,875
Thank you, Maya.

372
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:44,791
What's the matter?

373
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:46,500
Don't worry--It's nothing.

374
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:49,708
Something must be wrong, Kazuki.
You look really pale.

375
00:19:50,916 --> 00:19:54,625
Sorry, I'm fine now.
You should head back.

376
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,166
You sure?

377
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:58,916
Why don't you go let my
mom take a look at you?

378
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,833
No, it's okay.
I'm all right.

379
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:02,291
Are you positive?

380
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:04,791
Yeah.
Please, you should go back.

381
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:06,583
I want to be alone.

382
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:10,791
All right...
I'll see you later then.

383
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:17,791
Feel free to come
by for dinner again.

384
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:19,625
You'll always be welcome.

385
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:21,791
That's great.
Thank you.

386
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:24,458
I'll talk to you soon.

387
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,208
Kazuki...

388
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:58,541
I wonder where
are you right now?

389
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:27,458
Huh?
Was that Kazuki?

390
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:33,083
What is it?!

391
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:35,041
Looks like he's
taken the Mark Elf.

392
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:36,416
What?

393
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:39,458
Was this your doing?
Did you order him to take off?

394
00:21:39,541 --> 00:21:40,666
Of course not.

395
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,708
Why would I give
him an order like that?

396
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:44,500
Then why?

397
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:47,000
Do you have any
idea where he's going?

398
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:49,291
I've absolutely
no interest in this.

399
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:51,708
Not in someone
who's leaving the island.

400
00:21:56,291 --> 00:21:59,916
You're doing a very good
job, Kazuki Makabe.

401
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,083
So where are we
headed, Miss Kariya?

402
00:22:02,166 --> 00:22:03,750
Tell me.

403
00:22:04,916 --> 00:22:06,458
To somewhere nice.

404
00:22:06,541 --> 00:22:08,791
A new paradise.

405
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:15,083
We were searching
for answers although

406
00:22:15,166 --> 00:22:18,125
we couldn't even see
each other clearly.

407
00:22:18,208 --> 00:22:20,583
How were we to
understand each other?

408
00:22:21,083 --> 00:22:23,416
We couldn't understand.

409
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:26,125
But we didn't want to
make that our excuse.

410
00:22:26,208 --> 00:22:29,458
So then...
we lost something...

411
00:22:29,541 --> 00:22:30,708
...again.

412
00:22:31,125 --> 00:22:36,083
♪ closing song ♪

413
00:23:39,541 --> 00:23:43,041
A world that shows
off its old scars.

414
00:23:43,125 --> 00:23:45,458
The shadow of a new battle.

415
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:50,041
And a trap called...
betrayal.

416
00:23:52,625 --> 00:23:56,791
Next on Fafner episode
number eleven.

417
00:23:56,875 --> 00:23:58,750
"The Neo UN Force."

418
00:24:00,708 --> 00:24:02,000
Are you there?
