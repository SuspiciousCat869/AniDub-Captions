2
00:01:59,416 --> 00:02:01,541
I'm going to fight, as well.

3
00:02:02,291 --> 00:02:03,958
Shoko.

4
00:02:10,625 --> 00:02:13,333
If you feel sick, I want
you to tell me right away.

5
00:02:13,416 --> 00:02:16,208
Don't worry, Mom.
I'm gonna be just fine.

6
00:02:30,791 --> 00:02:32,875
Checking the pilot's
physical condition.

7
00:02:32,958 --> 00:02:36,041
There are no signs...
of any air sickness.

8
00:02:36,125 --> 00:02:38,958
Maya is so amazing.

9
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:47,500
It's so beautiful.

10
00:02:47,583 --> 00:02:51,208
What's remarkable is that her
emotions are unusually stable.

11
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:53,333
I guess she's insensitive
in a good way, huh?

12
00:02:53,416 --> 00:02:56,208
So then, she should be able
to fight immediately, right?

13
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:58,250
I agree, but I think
she's more suitable to

14
00:02:58,333 --> 00:03:00,333
handle back up
rather than the front lines.

15
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:02,958
That's because you don't want
her to be on the frontlines...

16
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:04,541
...isn't that right?

17
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:07,333
Let's see how she does with the
long range weapons simulator.

18
00:03:07,416 --> 00:03:08,625
Yes sir.

19
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,833
I've begun the initiation of the
weapons simulation program.

20
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:15,208
You'll start the target practice
using Dragon Tooth.

21
00:03:16,416 --> 00:03:21,000
I guess I should just try using
it the way Mr. Mizoguchi does.

22
00:03:23,583 --> 00:03:26,375
Well she looks pretty
damn good with that thing.

23
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:28,500
Start her out at one thousand
two hundred meters.

24
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:31,041
I'm releasing
the target right now.

25
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:37,708
Just stay calm.

26
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:40,666
Concentrate on the rhythm
of your breathing, that's right.

27
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:43,833
Woah! I don't believe it.
She hit it dead on!

28
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:47,375
Move it two hundred meters
back each time she hits it.

29
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:53,875
She's still maintaining a
success rate of over 90 percent.

30
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:57,000
Target's current distance...
twenty-eight hundred meters.

31
00:03:57,083 --> 00:03:59,875
Maya's naturally
really good at all of this.

32
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:01,750
You're right. She could
provide excellent back up.

33
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:03,875
We don't know how
she'll do in actual battle.

34
00:04:03,958 --> 00:04:07,416
You know I've got a
feeling she'll do just fine.

35
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,583
And if we train her well,

36
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:10,041
she won't have any
problems shooting alone.

37
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:11,666
She's got the
potential of becoming

38
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,875
the best sniper here at Alvis.

39
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:18,125
Why won't you let
me pilot this Fafner?

40
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:21,125
The pilots of the Nothung Models
have special requirements.

41
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:22,666
And they're assigned
to their Fafners

42
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:25,500
according to
their genetic makeup.

43
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:28,041
And this Mark Sein
is so in tune with Kazuki

44
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:31,666
that it won't accept any pilot's
synergetic code except for his.

45
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,416
I'm so jealous of Kazuki.

46
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,833
I want to have a personalized
Fafner just like him.

47
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:37,750
Why don't we just
go ask the Neo U.N.?

48
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:39,333
Maybe they'll make
yours all special

49
00:04:39,416 --> 00:04:40,625
like they did to Kazuki's.

50
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:43,000
I wouldn't do
that if I were you.

51
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:44,750
What do you mean?

52
00:04:45,541 --> 00:04:49,125
This thing here...
It nearly assimilated Maya once.

53
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:52,833
This has three times more
Fenrir in it than the others.

54
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:54,083
It's to make
sure there's nothing

55
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:56,458
left of it if it needs
to be destroyed.

56
00:04:56,541 --> 00:04:59,375
So do you still want to pilot
something like that now?

57
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:01,000
We don't know
her real potential.

58
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:03,541
So we shouldn't
use her in combat yet.

59
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:06,541
Are you afraid that
if Maya becomes a pilot,

60
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:08,500
she'll be in greater danger?

61
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:12,541
If Kazuki and Maya
were both in danger,

62
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:15,625
which would you
try to save first?

63
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:24,083
I thought you would want to go

64
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:26,083
watch Maya's
training session today.

65
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:27,625
I didn't have the time to.

66
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:29,375
I have to finish
this report by today.

67
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:30,583
Let's have a look.

68
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:33,166
Bon also known as Ura
Bon is a Buddhist

69
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,875
holiday celebrating the dead,
which island residents

70
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:37,041
are encouraged to take part in.

71
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:39,250
In other words,
it's on the Bon festival.

72
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:41,416
We're gonna have a
festival at a time like this?

73
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,166
Now's the more
reason to have one.

74
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,416
The whole purpose
of this island is to promote

75
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,125
a culture of peacefulness.

76
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:48,583
The training's over.
I'm back.

77
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:50,375
Welcome back, Rina.

78
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:52,958
It was incredible.
Maya was so cool.

79
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:54,625
Commander Makabe even said she

80
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:56,750
could probably start
fighting immediately.

81
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:58,083
So she's that good.

82
00:05:58,166 --> 00:05:59,083
Yeah.

83
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:00,583
I see...

84
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:01,916
I'm sending you some data.

85
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,666
Can you confirm
each section for me?

86
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,250
Sure.

87
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:07,958
Michio...

88
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:10,208
Why do we need
to have so many pilots?

89
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:12,833
Because the Festum are
becoming more and more active.

90
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:14,583
A huge swarm of
them could suddenly

91
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,625
show up and just attack
us at any moment.

92
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:19,708
Well, it's not as
if I don't know that.

93
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:23,125
By the way,
we're still gonna go through

94
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:24,583
with that plan of
ours today, right?!

95
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:26,916
Uh, yeah right.

96
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,333
Maya and the rest of my family
are having serious issues.

97
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:33,625
Um, yeah.

98
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:35,083
Quite frankly,

99
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:38,125
the thought of Maya getting
in a Fafner terrifies me.

100
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:39,291
I'm sorry.

101
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:42,000
I know everyone's
had to make sacrifices.

102
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:44,625
The children are the ones
who are really scared.

103
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:46,291
If the adults
start acting anxious,

104
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:48,833
it will put unnecessary
pressure on them.

105
00:06:48,916 --> 00:06:50,125
And we don't want that.

106
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:52,208
I understand.

107
00:06:53,041 --> 00:06:55,333
We've been able to keep
him alive for a long time.

108
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:56,416
Yes...

109
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,500
Thanks to the new
data from Moldova

110
00:06:58,583 --> 00:06:59,875
as well as his own strength too.

111
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:03,416
It's possible we'll be
able prolong pilots' lives.

112
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:07,000
And as a result,
perhaps our future too.

113
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:10,666
Both you and your
daughter have great vision.

114
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,291
You have the
ability to see beyond

115
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:14,833
the normal
limitations of science.

116
00:07:14,916 --> 00:07:18,041
Your contributions
have not been in vain.

117
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:25,583
Oops!

118
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:28,458
Hey there, careful little
lady, you all right?

119
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,708
Yeah, I'm okay.

120
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:36,166
So many Mr. Mizoguchi
spinning round 'n round.

121
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:38,250
You all right Maya?

122
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,875
What good timing.
Come over here for a second.

123
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:42,458
Uh, what happened?

124
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:45,541
She's acting drunk from the side
effect of the synergetic code.

125
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:47,875
Did you say she was drunk?

126
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:49,375
I'm not drunk you guys.

127
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:51,250
You can see why they
call it beginner's high.

128
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:52,958
It's probably
this bad because she

129
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:55,541
was extra tense since it was
her first training session.

130
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:58,208
That's why I'm
leaving the rest to you.

131
00:07:58,291 --> 00:07:59,000
Thanks.

132
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:00,458
Uh... Huh?

133
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:02,541
She's gonna be an important
fighting colleague to you.

134
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:03,625
So you'd better take her home.

135
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:05,583
A colleague...

136
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:07,875
I found you, Kazuki!

137
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:09,250
Hey Maya!

138
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:10,416
What are you two doing?

139
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,541
Soshi!

140
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:12,916
This really isn't
what it looks like!

141
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Huh?

142
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:16,250
Oh Soshi and Tsubaki.
How ya doin'?

143
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:17,875
We're doing real great!

144
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:20,541
I'm so glad to hear that.

145
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,083
Soshi.
Help me out.

146
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:24,375
I'm sorry, but I can't.
I'm busy right now.

147
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:25,583
What?

148
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:28,958
Be the responsible one
and take Maya home.

149
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:32,333
Consider this an order from
your battle commander.

150
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:35,916
Bye Soshi and Tsubaki.
See ya!

151
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:42,583
You're tough on
people, aren't you?

152
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:43,750
I'd save all of them.

153
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:45,125
Huh?

154
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:46,458
It's the answer to the
question you asked earlier.

155
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:48,250
I wouldn't put one over another.

156
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:49,666
However dangerous,

157
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:52,291
I would protect all pilots in
the Siegfried System.

158
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:58,875
Don't worry. 'Cuz you're
not alone in that. Soshi.

159
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:00,791
Are you feeling a
little better now Maya?

160
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:02,791
Yeah.

161
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:06,000
I can walk by myself now.

162
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:08,333
Sorry...

163
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:10,791
I got kind of carried
away back there.

164
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:12,375
It's okay.

165
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:14,041
I wasn't able to walk after my
first training session either.

166
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:15,916
No, that's not what I meant.

167
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,291
Perhaps I was like
that cuz I was so happy.

168
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:19,875
What do you mean "happy"?

169
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:24,041
I was finally able to see the
same things everyone else saw...

170
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:27,000
I'm sure that's
how Shoko felt too.

171
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:29,000
But instead of piloting Fafner,

172
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:31,791
it felt more like I
was becoming Fafner.

173
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:34,333
Like becoming a different me.

174
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:41,916
I'm going to do my best
to be just like you.

175
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,125
Oh, Maya.

176
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:46,208
Hey, you two!

177
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:49,125
What are you doing with
so many bags, Sis?

178
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:50,875
It's so that we can
celebrate your training!

179
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:52,041
Huh?

180
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:53,875
Kazuki, why don't
you celebrate with us?

181
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:56,875
Thank you but I'm supposed
to see my Dad today so...

182
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:58,166
I've got an idea.

183
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:00,375
We should invite Commander
Makabe to come too!

184
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:01,583
You're right!

185
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:03,000
I'll go contact him
and see what he says.

186
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:05,750
Wait a minute. What do
you think you are doing?

187
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:07,333
Don't you worry about it.

188
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:09,375
Let's get everything ready
before Mom comes home.

189
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:11,458
I appreciate
the invitation, bu--

190
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:13,041
Alright, quit your complaining.

191
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:14,666
Think of it as if you're
helping me out a little.

192
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:15,708
Oh.

193
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:29,041
Hey Kazuki's really
an amazing cook, isn't he?

194
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:30,708
I know he cooks
for his dad at home.

195
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:32,083
If you move in with him,

196
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:34,291
he could cook for you,
since you're so bad at it.

197
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:35,375
Whatever!

198
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:37,041
Not everyone's
like you are, okay Sis?

199
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:38,375
What's wrong with it?

200
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:40,541
Besides if you did it too,
maybe Mom would be

201
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:42,375
more understanding
about me doing it.

202
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:45,625
I wouldn't expect her to be.
But...

203
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:50,208
That's perfect!
This will be our primary weapon.

204
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:53,333
Now, onto the rest
of the culinary arsenal.

205
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:56,208
Oh no! The enemy approached
sooner than I expected.

206
00:10:56,291 --> 00:10:57,041
Hm?

207
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:59,250
Is she here already?!

208
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:02,791
We must be brave and
face the enemy head on!

209
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:05,166
Man, what a rough day...
Huh?

210
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:08,250
Welcome home.
Mother.

211
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:10,291
What?
What's going on?

212
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:11,875
Excuse me.

213
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:14,583
I heard that Kazuki was here...

214
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:22,958
Do you come over here a lot?

215
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:25,083
Just every once in awhile.

216
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:28,250
What are trying to accomplish
by doing this, Yumiko?

217
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:29,666
Not so bad, is it?

218
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,250
I did pretty well here.
Didn't I.

219
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:32,833
What's that supposed to mean?

220
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:37,500
Mom, Mr. Makabe is the only real
person you confide in, isn't he?

221
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:40,083
I completed the
dish-washing task

222
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:41,791
and I'm ready
for your next assignment.

223
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:44,125
Thank you.
Here, have some tea.

224
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:45,791
Is that an order?

225
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:48,541
No. Of course not. Have a seat.

226
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:55,291
When I don't have any orders,
I'm at a loss as to what to do.

227
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:57,750
Then, go ahead and be at a loss.

228
00:11:58,375 --> 00:12:00,041
That'll be the
only order from me

229
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:02,708
that you'll ever have
to follow, Canon.

230
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:08,333
That'll be quite
a tough mission.

231
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:13,125
This will be the first Bon
festival in which we honor Dad.

232
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:15,791
I will defeat as many
enemies as possible.

233
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:17,791
That way Dad's
soul can rest in peace.

234
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:19,291
Sakura...

235
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:22,958
I promise never to
run away from the enemy.

236
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:32,166
Thank you very much for dinner.

237
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,750
I apologize for
Yumiko's behavior today.

238
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:35,833
It's okay.

239
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:37,041
It's been awhile
since I've remembered

240
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:39,416
why this island was created.

241
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:45,541
If you don't mind
me commenting on it,

242
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:49,666
some people are simply trying to
start a new life for themselves.

243
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:51,208
It's just that...

244
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:53,541
Michio and Yumiko
are both good people.

245
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:55,208
And you should
be able to trust them.

246
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:58,541
Sometimes you need to let your
children go to see them grow.

247
00:12:58,625 --> 00:12:59,708
Yeah.

248
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,250
Yeah!

249
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:06,541
Sure was an interesting
dinner, wasn't it, Kazuki?

250
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:08,500
Uh... is something
the matter?

251
00:13:08,583 --> 00:13:11,333
I was just thinking that some
things never change, do they?

252
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:12,583
Huh?

253
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:16,208
You're probably right.

254
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:22,916
It's a notice about
the Bon festival.

255
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,416
What do we do for that?

256
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,750
We build this high wooden
stage and everybody dances.

257
00:13:26,833 --> 00:13:28,125
And we'll have stalls too.

258
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:29,500
Is it like a dance party?

259
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:31,250
Not really.
It's kinda different.

260
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:33,416
It's the part of the
festival where we all pray

261
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,500
for the peace for the deceased.

262
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:35,750
So it's like a requiem.

263
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:37,125
Yeah, right.
It's more like that.

264
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:39,041
Don't forget we're
gonna need to prepare

265
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:41,583
something for Karin and Shoko.

266
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:45,250
Wait a minute.
What about Koyo?

267
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:48,041
What the hell you talking about?
He's still alive, you idiot!

268
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:49,375
Who's Koyo?

269
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:50,500
He's a good friend of ours,

270
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:52,666
and someone who
I wasn't able to save.

271
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,416
Oh, I see.

272
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,708
I know!
Let's visit Koyo again.

273
00:13:56,791 --> 00:14:00,708
I'm sure he will wake up sooner
if we talk to him more.

274
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:21,750
You can't go!
Not over there!

275
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,041
I have Solomon's response.

276
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:29,125
It's ambivalent.

277
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:30,458
And it is unable
to determine the type.

278
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:32,666
It's not recognizing the
target as an enemy either.

279
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:33,750
I don't care!

280
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:35,541
I want you to
start the Vaffe Larden.

281
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:36,583
And get all of the pilots

282
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:38,041
onboard their
Fafners immediately.

283
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:39,958
If Solomon doesn't
think of it as an enemy,

284
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:41,750
I'd hate to imagine
what that means.

285
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:44,625
Even so, this'll be one
troublesome battle.

286
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:47,708
We may even lose a
few pilots with this one.

287
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:50,708
I'll position each pilot
in a different direction.

288
00:14:50,791 --> 00:14:52,541
Make sure the
Mark Sieben is positioned

289
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:53,833
in the center
with the equipment.

290
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:55,375
Do you mean Maya?

291
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:57,000
It's gonna be a numbers game.

292
00:14:57,083 --> 00:14:59,875
Our damage could be as
bad as it was at Moldova.

293
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:01,708
I won't let that happen.

294
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:03,500
Do your best.

295
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:08,416
Maya.

296
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:14,208
Mom...

297
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:18,416
I'll see you back at home.

298
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:25,541
No matter what it
takes I won't let

299
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:28,083
you have your way on my island.

300
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:31,500
We'll attack simultaneous
from five locales.

301
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:34,208
Everyone take your
instructed positions!

302
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:37,625
I'm ready whenever you guys are.

303
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:41,041
Okay, I'm in position.

304
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:45,000
I'm ready for your next orders.

305
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,875
Goubain!

306
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:51,083
Don't you think this
is all a bit sudden.

307
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:54,916
This is for you.
Okay Dad?

308
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:04,791
How are you doing?
You okay Maya?

309
00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:06,083
Yeah thanks.

310
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:07,583
I'm linking all the audio
communication lines

311
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:09,041
to you so you'll
know what's going on.

312
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:10,625
But make sure that
you're only following

313
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:12,541
my instructions and
not someone else's.

314
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:14,000
Right. Got it.

315
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,166
The enemy is assimilating
with the Welle Shield.

316
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:22,875
I take it the Brunhilde System
is working, is that correct?

317
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:25,791
It has automatically switched
over to its the defensive modes.

318
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:28,083
I had a feeling it would
be one of those rare types.

319
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:30,083
As did I.

320
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:45,750
It just went down.

321
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:47,250
So did we defeat it?

322
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:49,125
Here comes the rare type.
Be ready.

323
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:51,541
Remember to watch
your back, Canon.

324
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:12,833
Use as much
firepower as possible!

325
00:17:12,916 --> 00:17:16,166
Don't attempt hand to hand
combat no matter what.

326
00:17:18,583 --> 00:17:22,208
That's weird.
Why isn't he attacking back?

327
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:36,708
Release the Aegis!

328
00:17:36,791 --> 00:17:39,083
Mark Funf, you must retreat!

329
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:40,166
Mark Acht!

330
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,791
Attack when it's trying
to assimilate!

331
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:56,375
I did it.
I really did it!

332
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:58,041
It's the eye!
Everyone.

333
00:17:58,125 --> 00:18:00,041
Aim for the eyes in the head.

334
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:04,208
Damn, that thing's fast!

335
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:06,958
I hate fighting
these kinds of Festum!

336
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:08,833
Now!

337
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:11,208
You're going straight to hell!

338
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:18,666
The enemies located
at nine o'clock,

339
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,708
one o'clock, and six o'clock
have all disappeared.

340
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:22,500
The enemy located
at three o'clock

341
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:24,083
is retreating to the
upper atmospheres.

342
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:25,208
They're doing pretty good.

343
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:26,250
It's not over.

344
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:27,833
All it takes is one
of those things

345
00:18:27,916 --> 00:18:29,875
to destroy the whole island.

346
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:33,000
Outta bullets!
Damn you!

347
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:35,166
Don't make contact!
Mark Drei!

348
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:36,833
Retreat now!

349
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:45,250
Mark Drei is in danger.

350
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:47,083
She needs, back up.

351
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,291
No!

352
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:53,666
Help!
I'm scared!

353
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:54,916
Mom, help me!

354
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,083
Sakura, no...

355
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:57,791
Hurry up and eject
that pilot right now!

356
00:18:57,875 --> 00:18:59,583
That's what I'm doing!

357
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:06,166
No... what am I
supposed to do now?

358
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:08,250
Do you want me
to shoot Sakura too?!

359
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:09,875
We've arrived at the scene.

360
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:12,083
We'll take care of this.

361
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:16,208
Once they stop moving that's
when I'm going in for the shot.

362
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:17,375
I'll do it.

363
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:19,791
I don't mind if
I take the blame.

364
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:21,625
You would...

365
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:24,416
If anything should go wrong, at
least I'm not from this island.

366
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,250
Stop it! You'll end
up killing Sakura!

367
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:31,791
I'm now disabling all
of Mark Acht's weapons.

368
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:33,958
--Sakura!
--No!

369
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:36,083
--Sakura!
--Stop it!

370
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:37,583
Soshi, can you hear me?

371
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:38,958
--Ignore them, Canon!

372
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:40,250
--Are you listening, Soshi?
--Ignore them, Canon!

373
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:43,125
Why did you do it?
Why did you lock my weapon?

374
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:44,666
Answer me Soshi.

375
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:47,916
Because once you fire, the
enemy will advance toward you.

376
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,291
I don't care.

377
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:52,666
Besides... That's why I'm here.

378
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:56,166
Kazuki... 

379
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:57,708
I'm going to draw the
enemy away from Mark Drei.

380
00:19:57,791 --> 00:19:59,208
After that, it's up to you.

381
00:19:59,291 --> 00:20:00,208
Draw it away?

382
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:01,333
And how are you
going to do that?

383
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:02,958
Mark Sieben
will take care of it.

384
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:04,833
Do you mean Maya?

385
00:20:04,916 --> 00:20:07,166
Okay, let's do it.

386
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:21,166
They did it!

387
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,375
There is one more out there!

388
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:25,708
No!

389
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:27,291
Maya!

390
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:40,666
All the Festum have disappeared!

391
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:42,333
And our pilots appear
to be unharmed.

392
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:45,666
Way to go Maya.
She is so awesome.

393
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:46,916
Good job.

394
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,125
Instruct them all to land
at Mukoujima dock.

395
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:50,291
All right everyone.

396
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:52,916
Let's go give them
a hero's welcome.

397
00:20:58,416 --> 00:20:59,750
Sakura!

398
00:21:02,916 --> 00:21:04,625
Mom!

399
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:11,875
I was so scared.
I thought I wouldn't make it.

400
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:23,458
Welcome back, Canon.
You okay?

401
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:27,583
Yeah, I'm back again.

402
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:34,833
What is this?
That's weird.

403
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:37,916
Why am I just
feeling scared now?

404
00:21:53,958 --> 00:21:57,125
We will celebrate by having
dinner together, Soshi.

405
00:21:57,208 --> 00:21:59,125
Could you stop
taking charge of things.

406
00:21:59,208 --> 00:22:00,250
I'm your big brother, after all.

407
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:02,000
That doesn't make a difference.

408
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:04,625
You'll always be Soshi, to me.

409
00:22:32,166 --> 00:22:37,125
♪ closing song ♪

410
00:23:38,916 --> 00:23:42,708
Tatsumiya Island is
bustling from the festival.

411
00:23:43,458 --> 00:23:46,166
Memorial lights are everywhere.

412
00:23:47,083 --> 00:23:50,125
Some memories never go away.

413
00:23:50,833 --> 00:23:55,791
Next on "Fafner"
episode number twenty.

"Light."

Are you there?
