00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:53,833
Mamoru, you're wearing that

3
00:01:53,916 --> 00:01:56,041
strange get-up from
this morning again!

4
00:01:56,125 --> 00:01:58,208
I want you to take
it off right now.

5
00:01:58,291 --> 00:02:00,166
But I can't get myself
all pumped up if

6
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:01,875
I don't wear all
this stuff, Mom!

7
00:02:01,958 --> 00:02:03,291
Sometimes I
wonder what you're

8
00:02:03,375 --> 00:02:05,333
using all that energy for.

9
00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:16,375
Mr. Kodate,
Commander Makabe has arrived.

10
00:02:16,458 --> 00:02:18,166
The Commander?

11
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:20,625
So, it's been decided...

12
00:02:20,708 --> 00:02:24,041
Yes, Kenji Kondo
is Mark Achat's pilot...

13
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:27,541
...and Mamoru Kodate
will pilot the Mark Hguc.

14
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:30,125
So he's gonna let other
people's children pilot Fafner

15
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:32,208
just because his own son
ran away with some woman.

16
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:34,708
No, Commander Makabe
is not that kind of person.

17
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:36,666
It's real easy for you
to say that because

18
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:39,500
your daughter
doesn't pilot Fafner.

19
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:43,791
I'm so sorry...

20
00:02:43,875 --> 00:02:46,875
I thought I was prepared
for this to happen.

21
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:49,500
Mark Zex and Vier are toast.

22
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:52,583
Having only Drei
is certainly not enough.

23
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:54,958
I have absolutely no
idea what more I could

24
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:56,750
have done for him as a father...

25
00:02:56,833 --> 00:02:59,083
But I can't help wonder...

26
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:04,250
I'm leaving his life in yours
and Soshi's hands, Makabe...

27
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:08,250
Bring him back
alive at any cost.

28
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:12,333
Yes...
I promise I will.

29
00:03:16,791 --> 00:03:18,041
Shoko...

30
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:22,500
I heard Kenji and Mamoru
are going to pilot Fafner.

31
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:27,291
Again... I can't do
anything to help...

32
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:30,333
I'm just watching
everything happen...

33
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:34,916
Shoko...
did you feel the same way?

34
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:38,791
Every time I showed
you the school pictures...

35
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:42,083
Did you feel lonely like this?

36
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:49,125
Now I finally understand how

37
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:53,000
you must have felt
back then Shoko...

38
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:54,458
I guess that...

39
00:03:54,541 --> 00:03:57,458
I can't complain about
Kazuki and Soshi...

40
00:03:57,541 --> 00:04:00,000
Not anymore at least.

41
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:08,000
Me?
They want me to pilot?

42
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:08,791
Really?

43
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:11,708
Yes.
It's been decided.

44
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:15,541
Kenji if you don't
think you're up to it,

45
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:17,166
then I can certainly tell...

46
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,208
Yeah!

47
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:21,541
I'll be able to use this
to pick up chicks!

48
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:25,708
You're such an idiot!

49
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:46,416
Darling...

50
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,333
Why don't you
take a little break?

51
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:49,875
You didn't sleep
at all yesterday

52
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:51,875
because of the Fafner tune up.

53
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,416
I have to do this as a father!

54
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:57,875
Then let me help you with it.

55
00:04:57,958 --> 00:05:00,208
Tell me what to do.

56
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:02,416
Thank you, dear.

57
00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:12,666
Prisoner, here's your food.

58
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,333
What I don't get is,
how could a person like you

59
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:18,416
become the pilot of
a Nothung model?

60
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,875
Huh?

61
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:21,541
First I cut off
your Fafner's arm,

62
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:24,291
and then you let yourself be
captured in the heat of battle.

63
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:25,541
Why?

64
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:30,041
Really?

65
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:32,750
You were the one
piloting that red Fafner?

66
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:35,875
That's right.
And the Fafner is ours.

67
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:38,541
You are of no consequence now.

68
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,666
Wait a second!

69
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:45,791
How can they fight among humans

70
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:48,500
with no concerns
for anything...?

71
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:50,375
Something's wrong with them!

72
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:55,375
Let me out of here this instant!

73
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:57,625
A brat like you
has no authority--

74
00:05:58,375 --> 00:06:00,041
Open this door!!

75
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:01,666
Who is the
commander of this unit?

76
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,708
Tell him to come here right now!

77
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:06,250
Do you know what's gonna happen
to you for treating me this way?

78
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:08,625
Open this door immediately!

79
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:11,875
My orders are to do
that to you whenever

80
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:13,750
you become too annoying.

81
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:17,666
Hey!

82
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,625
Any contact yet
from the Neo U.N.?

83
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:20,416
Not yet.

84
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,916
I see...

85
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,291
I sure do hope that this time

86
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:26,083
they don't come across
with Festum in tow...

87
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:27,750
Kazuki...

88
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:34,208
Can you ring these up?

89
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:35,708
Ah, Tamotsu.

90
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:38,833
I've already put the manuscript
in the disc-13 folder.

91
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:40,125
Yes, I have found
it and have

92
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:42,083
nearly completed
checking it over.

93
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:44,208
It's just about
ready to be printed.

94
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:45,708
Great.
Thanks a lot.

95
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:48,291
By the way, there
sure are a lot of pages.

96
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:51,833
I know you're busy and all,
but it seems extreme.

97
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:55,333
I know but it can't be helped,
we are fighting for our dream!

98
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:57,083
So whatever it takes.

99
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:59,791
You wrote the same
line here, didn't you.

100
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:03,166
Yeah I guess I did...

101
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:03,916
Here!

102
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,791
Huh?

103
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:07,000
I've got a little gift for you.

104
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:09,333
That's great.
Thank you so much.

105
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:13,833
Status report!

106
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:15,250
Coming in at 4 o'clock.

107
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:17,500
The gravity response is at 785.

108
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:20,625
It appears that the
target is approaching

109
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:23,250
the island at a
heading of 7-4-0.

110
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:26,708
Solomon is responding.
It's a Sphinx type.

111
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:29,375
Kenji.

112
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:38,708
It seems different than normal.

113
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:42,208
I'm going to deploy Fafner
in triple dock formation.

114
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:43,708
Use Devil Ray
and intercept it on the

115
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:45,791
land at its current location.

116
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:48,791
You want me to go without the
Brunhilde system back up?

117
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:49,791
That's right.

118
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:50,833
We need to strike
while the enemy

119
00:07:50,916 --> 00:07:52,875
is still maintaining
its distance.

120
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:55,166
It seems a little different
from the past ones.

121
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:56,541
Yes, sir.

122
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:58,458
I want everything online and
ready in twenty seconds!

123
00:07:58,541 --> 00:07:59,333
Move it!

124
00:07:59,416 --> 00:08:00,833
We need to load the Devil Ray!

125
00:08:00,916 --> 00:08:03,041
And don't forget to check
the cage for clearance!

126
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:04,500
Yes, Sir!

127
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:08,875
I'm counting on you!

128
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:11,708
Bring back the
children unharmed.

129
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,125
Tell Mamoru that thing doesn't
look very good on him.

130
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:21,375
Even if I did tell him that...

131
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:22,833
...he wouldn't listen.

132
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:25,708
He's very stubborn
about stuff like that.

133
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:33,625
What is that thing
supposed to be?!

134
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:35,083
Mamoru, come back here!

135
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:36,916
You know, it's his first battle.

136
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,458
Just leave him alone.

137
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:41,000
But Mr. Kodate...

138
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:46,625
Wow!
This pain is ridiculous!

139
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:49,125
All right!

140
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:52,333
Three Fafners will be loaded
onto Devil Ray transport,

141
00:08:52,416 --> 00:08:54,208
and brought to the destination.

142
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:56,041
Before coming in
contact with the enemy,

143
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:57,916
descend with Mark
Hguc in the lead.

144
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,958
Deploy in triple dock formation.

145
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:04,666
Soshi, my name is Goubain!

146
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:09,625
Fafner Mark Hguc,
you must take off now!

147
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:12,916
Goubain!

148
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:26,375
Devil Ray, prepare for take off.
Final check all systems.

149
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:27,958
There are two people
on board who haven't

150
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:29,750
had the degenerating mind test.

151
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:32,291
Do you anticipate that there
will be any negative changes

152
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:35,416
to their minds due to the
influence of synergetic codes?

153
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,875
Sakura was completely
unable to control the very

154
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:39,625
aggressive behavior
that overcame her

155
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:41,416
during the heat of
the last battle.

156
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,125
I believe that the
remaining two will

157
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:44,833
show some sort of
change as well...

158
00:09:44,916 --> 00:09:46,041
Clear for take off.

159
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:48,000
Watch for any mental
changes in the pilots.

160
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:49,875
Yes, I intend to.

161
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:53,541
If it were Kazuki, this kind of
problem wouldn't happen...

162
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:55,708
Devil Ray is taking off. 

163
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:17,208
You will arrive at the target
island group in two minutes.

164
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:20,083
Start each thruster four
seconds after ejecting.

165
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:22,791
Move to the scheduled
position and stand by.

166
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:25,208
Don't take action until
you receive an order.

167
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:28,291
Where?
Where is it?

168
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:33,208
The gravity vibration is 20
kilometers ahead of Devil Ray.

169
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:35,208
At this rate,
they'll hit it directly.

170
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:38,666
Emergency separation!
Let the container drop!

171
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:46,500
Direct hit to Welle Shield One!

172
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:49,291
It's a long-range
attack weapon...

173
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:57,375
I don't want this.
Mommy, I wanna go home.

174
00:10:57,458 --> 00:10:59,000
Damn you, Festum!

175
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:00,458
Excellent!

176
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:09,125
Fafners' landing
has been confirmed.

177
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:12,125
I will display each
pilot's vital stats monitor.

178
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:14,333
As expected,

179
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:15,791
the readouts of the
pilots' mental states

180
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:17,375
have changed quite dramatically.

181
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:19,833
Hm.
Soshi, attention...

182
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:22,000
...the enemy displayed
its attack skill first.

183
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:23,166
Affirmative, Commander.

184
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,083
I will re-plan the
attack strategy

185
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:27,125
based on this new information.

186
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,083
Mamoru!
What are you doing?

187
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:37,333
Soshi, Sakura, Kenji, listen.
I have an idea.

188
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:38,458
No, wait!

189
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:40,916
You have to stand
by for your orders!

190
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I am Goubain!

191
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:46,625
I will get hit on purpose.

192
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:49,458
Meanwhile, Sakura and Kenji
will destroy the enemy!

193
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:50,625
All right?

194
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:52,583
Can we really
do something like that?

195
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:53,750
I don't like it.

196
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:55,791
It doesn't matter if
I defeat the enemy.

197
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:57,333
Lets get to it quickly!

198
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:59,083
Mark Hguc!
Do not do it!

199
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:01,583
If your Aegis equipment isn't
strong enough to defend against

200
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:03,500
the enemy's attack,
then everyone else on

201
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:05,375
the mission will be in
danger as well...

202
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,416
Even if there is
no winning possibility,

203
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,333
trust tomorrow's
sunrise and fight...

204
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:13,333
That's the true
spirit of Goubain!

205
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:15,791
That's absurd...

206
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:17,708
...you can't have your own way.

207
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:20,500
I'll kick all of you out
of your cockpits!

208
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:23,333
It's not a bad strategy.
Let them go ahead and do it.

209
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:24,458
But...

210
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:26,625
It's the change of mentality.

211
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:28,750
Just go along with
the mission as if Sakura

212
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:30,208
were there instead of Mamoru.

213
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,750
Think of a plan that places
the one with the Aegis

214
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:34,708
equipment at the head
of the formation.

215
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:37,833
The enemy is using a
head on long-range attack.

216
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:40,625
Mark Hguc can
dodge it sufficiently.

217
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:44,041
Trust the pilots.

218
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:46,833
Roger that sir!

219
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:50,291
The target is moving
toward Fafners' landing spot!

220
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:58,041
Number one Welle
Shield has disappeared.

221
00:12:58,125 --> 00:13:00,375
All Fafners!
Spread out now!

222
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:02,833
At the same time
the enemy attacks,

223
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:06,000
Mark Achat is to fire
back from 3 0'clock.

224
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:09,583
At the same time, Mark Drei
is to circle behind the enemy!

225
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,083
Here I come!

226
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:18,000
Now!
One!

227
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,541
Two!

228
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:34,541
And now three!

229
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:04,541
Goubain smash!

230
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:16,083
Enemy's disappearance confirmed!

231
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:18,375
All of the pilots are unharmed.

232
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:22,916
Sakura I'm so
glad she's all right.

233
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:26,250
Good work everyone.

234
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:29,000
My idiot did well...

235
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,458
I'm so relieved.

236
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:39,416
Everybody is
fighting so bravely...

237
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:44,625
Darling Mamoru was Mamoru was...

238
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:45,708
I know.

239
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:47,916
He did it, Kodate!
He beat the enemy!

240
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,250
Uh huh... he really did it.

241
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:52,791
Mamoru really came
through this time...

242
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:55,958
Congratulations...
He did a great job.

243
00:14:57,375 --> 00:15:00,083
Thank you Yoko...
We're sorry about Shoko.

244
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:01,333
Don't be.

245
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:03,125
Although I appreciate
your concern for Shoko,

246
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:06,500
today is Mamoru's day.
You should enjoy it.

247
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:09,708
Thank you so much.

248
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:14,000
Why do we have to be stuck
in an awful place like this?

249
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:16,333
We did protect
the island, didn't we?

250
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,833
It's your punishment for acting
on your own judgment!

251
00:15:18,916 --> 00:15:21,500
Maybe the
next time you'll think.

252
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:23,750
I guess Soshi is right.

253
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:27,041
Mamoru, why are you still
wearing that goofball helmet?

254
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:31,000
Soshi is not satisfied
because your shooting stinks.

255
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:32,791
Think about what
you 're doing a little.

256
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:34,375
What're you talking about?

257
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:37,250
And another thing, you've got to
move a lot quicker, you klutz.

258
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,500
Huh?

259
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:42,708
Hey!

260
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:45,666
Just how did we get
into this place anyway?

261
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:48,750
What's the matter?
You guys look so angry.

262
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:50,125
I don't like it...

263
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:51,583
Who died and made you king?

264
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:53,291
It certainly wasn't one of us.

265
00:15:55,666 --> 00:15:58,000
Depending on the person,
his or her mind goes through

266
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:01,750
drastic changes as the
synergetic code forms.

267
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:05,375
I noticed the signs
in Shoko and Koyo.

268
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:08,708
But I didn't expect that they
would change that much...

269
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:11,625
Next time, we're going to have
to take into consideration their

270
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:15,041
altered state of mind and have
them attack much sooner.

271
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:16,458
What about Kazuki?

272
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:19,250
Why is it that Kazuki
wasn't affected by it at all?

273
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:22,166
What's needed to unite with
Fafner is a specific genetic

274
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:25,875
characteristic, and a
healthy dose of self-denial.

275
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:27,833
The self-denial
seems very important

276
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:29,875
in slowing the mind
alteration effect.

277
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:33,250
So Kazuki, keeps denying
himself on a daily basis.

278
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:35,500
Is that why his mind
isn't altered in any way

279
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:37,583
when he interacts with Fafner?

280
00:16:37,666 --> 00:16:39,375
You could say so.

281
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:42,708
But in his case, your
close existence seemed

282
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:45,166
to have stabilized his mind.

283
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:49,041
I was the one
who wanted stability.

284
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:50,958
Not Kazuki...

285
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:54,875
And he knew it too,
which is the reason why...

286
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:58,083
What is it, Soshi?

287
00:16:58,166 --> 00:17:00,541
I have to get going now...

288
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:06,958
Have you come up with any
idea as to why Kazuki left?

289
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:08,375
No, I haven't.

290
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:12,625
I hope what comes after
self-denial is self affirmation.

291
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:15,541
And I trust that Kazuki
and you will be able

292
00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:17,958
to reach that state some day.

293
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:21,916
Thank you but, you said
that as if you believe

294
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,375
Kazuki is still on the island.

295
00:17:25,958 --> 00:17:27,458
However...

296
00:17:27,541 --> 00:17:31,000
I don't believe he is, or that
he's ever going to come back.

297
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:36,375
I'll let those three out
of holding before nightfall.

298
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:37,958
I think they
learned their lessons,

299
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:39,625
and their parents have
been wanting to see them.

300
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:41,250
Excuse me.

301
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:47,666
In return for being able
to pay respect to others,

302
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:50,750
he has become
distant from them...

303
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:55,000
He reminds me so
much of Kozo in his youth.

304
00:17:55,666 --> 00:18:00,083
I'm sure my son has become a
prisoner of the Neo UN by now...

305
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:03,583
To think that he
is better off that way...

306
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:07,541
I may not be qualified
to be a commander...

307
00:18:28,916 --> 00:18:30,875
Hey Soshi!

308
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:34,208
Have you heard from Kazuki yet?

309
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:38,083
No. It's possible that he might
have been attacked by Festum.

310
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:40,625
Or he was caught by
the Neo U.N., In any case,

311
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:42,833
I'll have nothing to
do with him anymore.

312
00:18:42,916 --> 00:18:44,833
Why do you
say such awful things?

313
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:46,875
Is it because he didn't
understand you?

314
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:49,833
What about you, did you try
to understand him at all?

315
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:51,833
I understand him perfectly.

316
00:18:51,916 --> 00:18:54,208
Through the Siegfried
System I shared his feelings

317
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:56,083
with him many times
during battle.

318
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:57,875
I had communal
thoughts and lived

319
00:18:57,958 --> 00:19:00,250
with him through his psyche.

320
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:04,041
Looking into a person's mind
using a new technology...

321
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:07,208
Is that really what you call
understanding someone?

322
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:08,541
That's nothing.

323
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:11,708
Tell me something you
really know about Kazuki.

324
00:19:12,916 --> 00:19:14,958
I know him
way better than you do.

325
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:16,750
Huh!

326
00:19:18,041 --> 00:19:19,791
You're right...

327
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:21,583
What do I know?

328
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:23,916
I'm always left behind.

329
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Even at CDC,
I'm not very useful...

330
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:29,583
I'm not even
able to pilot a Fafner.

331
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:32,375
Instead, I get to stay back
here and watch with envy

332
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:35,541
everyone who gets
to go fight so bravely...

333
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:40,333
So you're right, I don't
understand anything at all.

334
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:43,250
Listen, Maya.

335
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:44,333
Uh-huh?

336
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:46,250
It's just...

337
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:51,041
It's just that we don't
need you to fight right now.

338
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:54,416
I see.

339
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:56,333
Soshi.

340
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,583
Can you tell me something?

341
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:01,791
Why didn't you ever
tell Kazuki the truth,

342
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:04,250
of how you feel about him?

343
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:07,125
If I could
have done that,

344
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:10,375
I would have told him
a long time ago...

345
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:12,750
Hey!

346
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:15,208
Long time no see, Kazuki Makabe.

347
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:16,958
Sorry you're in
such a small room.

348
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:20,333
You feel like going outside
and getting some fresh air?

349
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:22,708
Hey Michio?!

350
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:27,916
So, is this the first
time that you've

351
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,208
ever been off of the island?

352
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:29,916
Yes.

353
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,083
Sorry about the ties.

354
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:32,958
Try not to be too upset with me.

355
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:34,458
It's just part
of procedure here.

356
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:36,041
I understand...

357
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:38,958
Soon we will arrive at Moldova.
Can you be patient until then?

358
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:40,791
Yes... But uh...

359
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:44,833
Tell me, where is it that you
are living right now, Michio?

360
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:47,375
I don't have a permanent
address anymore these days.

361
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:50,500
Ever since my dad took me
off of the island so long ago,

362
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,666
the Neo UN has kept
me constantly moving

363
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,791
all over the place
as their soldier.

364
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:56,458
The Neo UN Force?

365
00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:57,958
Their soldier?

366
00:20:58,041 --> 00:21:00,333
So you think you
could tell me more

367
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:03,833
about the people on
Tatsumiya Island?

368
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:07,708
I see.
And my Mother too...?

369
00:21:07,791 --> 00:21:08,875
Yes.

370
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:10,333
I heard that she
was assimilated along with

371
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:12,958
Karin when Festum first
appeared there.

372
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:15,625
This must be
very difficult for you.

373
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:16,875
Yeah...

374
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:19,958
I wonder if I should even
tell my Dad about this.

375
00:21:20,041 --> 00:21:21,875
It's real tough...

376
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:25,250
Let's see...
who else?

377
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:26,541
Eh?

378
00:21:26,625 --> 00:21:29,541
Yumiko Tohmi,
what's she doing these days?

379
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:30,875
Oh Yumiko?

380
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:33,541
She's a nurse at the
first aid office at school.

381
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,083
What, she's a nurse?

382
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:36,500
That's a good one!

383
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:38,541
Did you know that when she
was younger her dream was

384
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:40,666
to go to Tokyo and
become a pop idol?

385
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,000
No, really?

386
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:43,583
Triple Six.

387
00:21:44,791 --> 00:21:46,125
What's Triple Six?

388
00:21:46,208 --> 00:21:48,000
It's just my code
name around here.

389
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:49,416
Do me a favor.

390
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,583
Will ya stop calling me by
my code name, and call me

391
00:21:51,666 --> 00:21:54,291
by my first name while
we're on standby?

392
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:55,666
You are my superior.

393
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:57,875
So I'm not permitted to
call you by your first name.

394
00:21:57,958 --> 00:22:01,041
You know, you are
so inflexible it's ridiculous.

395
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:03,208
Kazuki, this girl is Kanon.

396
00:22:03,291 --> 00:22:06,541
She's the one who cut off
your Fafner's arm in battle.

397
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:07,625
Yes I know that.

398
00:22:07,708 --> 00:22:09,250
We talked a little bit earlier.

399
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:13,083
Oh... How rare it is for
Kanon to actually speak...

400
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:15,041
Does that mean you like Kazuki?

401
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:16,208
Not really.

402
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:19,000
By the way, we're
about to arrive soon.

403
00:22:20,833 --> 00:22:21,875
...is that...?

404
00:22:21,958 --> 00:22:25,458
Neo U.N. Humanity
Force Moldova Base.

405
00:23:35,458 --> 00:23:37,166
I am going.

406
00:23:39,083 --> 00:23:41,625
I've been conflicted until now.

407
00:23:42,666 --> 00:23:44,958
The tie to the past.

408
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:51,041
What lies in the future is
a new and different path.

409
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:56,250
Next on Fafner--episode
number 13.

410
00:23:57,416 --> 00:23:58,875
"Festum."

411
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:01,250
Are you there?
