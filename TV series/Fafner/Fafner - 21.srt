1
00:01:43,333 --> 00:01:44,791
Attention all Fafners.

2
00:01:44,875 --> 00:01:47,500
Six Arfenotheles, and three
Sphinx types have been spotted.

3
00:01:47,583 --> 00:01:49,166
We've determined
they are all B-types.

4
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:50,833
Prepare for their
incoming approach.

5
00:01:50,916 --> 00:01:53,458
We are going into battle.

6
00:01:54,541 --> 00:01:58,000
The plan is to intercept
them as they land!

7
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:28,666
Confirming there
are no enemies left.

8
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,041
None of the pilots were harmed.

9
00:02:30,125 --> 00:02:31,833
It only took them
seventeen minutes

10
00:02:31,916 --> 00:02:33,250
to completely destroy the enemy.

11
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:34,625
That's a new record.

12
00:02:34,708 --> 00:02:36,125
This one is the sixth straight

13
00:02:36,208 --> 00:02:37,750
successful
interception this month.

14
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:39,041
It's great.

15
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:40,250
Hard to believe we used to have

16
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:42,666
such trouble against
just one Sphinx type.

17
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:45,125
Yeah, but now we can
maneuver up to seven Fafners

18
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:48,916
simultaneously in addition
to the entire island system.

19
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
That's great!

20
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:51,583
Today's battle
brings the total number

21
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:53,666
we've defeated to
over two hundred.

22
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:56,416
This is almost
too good to be true.

23
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,583
What do you think the secret to

24
00:02:57,666 --> 00:02:59,541
our victory has
been, Miss Yumiko?

25
00:02:59,625 --> 00:03:01,416
It's communication and unity,

26
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,583
as well as trust among
those in the fighting force.

27
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:06,250
Where is Tsubaki Minashiro?

28
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:08,416
She's in the southwestern
region of the Island.

29
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,833
She appears to have
been watching

30
00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:12,333
the entire battle from there.

31
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:22,750
I'm so comfortable I wouldn't be

32
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:24,666
able to fight if the
enemy showed up.

33
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:27,041
A nice long bath
after a hard battle.

34
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:29,333
Now this is the good life.

35
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,833
Goubain, taking off!

36
00:03:32,916 --> 00:03:34,000
Oh please...

37
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:36,875
...will someone just
take his helmet off?

38
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:38,791
Huh?

39
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:40,375
Oh, I'm in the bath.

40
00:03:40,458 --> 00:03:41,666
Where'd the enemy go...?

41
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:44,125
We already defeated
them a long time ago.

42
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:45,625
Well now that's interesting.

43
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:48,625
You really don't remember
anything that happens in battle?

44
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:50,583
Soshi!

45
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:51,916
What do you think?

46
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,958
If you decide to go into
battle with that mask on,

47
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:56,291
you're gonna be on your own.

48
00:03:58,083 --> 00:03:59,000
What are you doing?

49
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:00,833
Hey! That thing
looks good on you!

50
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:03,000
Hey, does this mean
our commander's

51
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:04,291
got a new look going on?

52
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:07,166
That's mine.
You can't have it.

53
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,500
Good, cuz I don't want it.

54
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,833
I'm so comfortable
that I wouldn't be able

55
00:04:11,916 --> 00:04:13,666
to fight if the enemy showed up.

56
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,416
Good work today, you guys!

57
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,000
Sis. You can't
be in here.

58
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:18,333
It's only for the pilots.

59
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:19,666
Relax will ya?

60
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:20,750
It's fine.

61
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:22,458
Besides, I am
your leader after all.

62
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:23,666
Is Canon here?

63
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,166
She's over there
in the corner, hiding.

64
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:26,708
Hm?

65
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,166
What's she doing way over there?

66
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:32,375
She says that she's not used to
being naked in front of people.

67
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:34,333
Hearing that just
makes me wanna drag her

68
00:04:34,416 --> 00:04:36,666
out into the open even more.

69
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:39,541
So then why don't we?

70
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:41,541
Hm?

71
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:45,708
What are you guys doing?!

72
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:47,208
Don't fight it!

73
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:49,458
Oh, your boobs are pretty big.

74
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:52,208
I'd say they're about the same
as Sakura's, aren't they?

75
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:53,875
Yeah, you're right!
I wonder if they feel the same.

76
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:55,458
Hey!
Cut it out!

77
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:58,250
You feel Canon's
and I'll feel Sakura's.

78
00:04:58,333 --> 00:04:59,208
Hey!
Why me?

79
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:00,333
I thought this was about her.

80
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:02,083
You guys are perverts!

81
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:04,708
What are those
girls doing, over there?

82
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:06,875
--Ohh! They're soft!
--Ohh! They're soft!

83
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:07,833
What is it?

84
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:09,833
I dunno.
What?

85
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:13,375
I gotta question for you.

86
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:16,083
When I'm out there fighting with
you guys, what am I like?

87
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:17,416
What do you mean?

88
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,083
Sometimes when I'm
sleeping I have dreams about it.

89
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:22,958
...but those dreams
I have make me scared.

90
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:25,708
During battles, you always
take the lead, and prevent the

91
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:27,875
enemy from advancing
by creating a diversion.

92
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:31,083
So it's thanks to you, that the
outcome ends up in our favor.

93
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:32,833
Really...

94
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:34,541
Essentially, it means
you're positioned

95
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:36,083
in the most dangerous location.

96
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:38,625
Being scared is only natural.

97
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:40,166
The way I see it,

98
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:42,208
you and Kazuki are what holds
our fighting force together.

99
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:44,458
Oh, I see.

100
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:48,041
Would you prefer us to
change the current formation?

101
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:49,916
How bout a two top formation?

102
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,750
Then you'd be leading the
offensive with Kazuki...

103
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:53,083
Nah that's okay.

104
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:56,291
Besides I like working
with Kenji and Sakura.

105
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:59,125
I see...

106
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,916
What are you staring at?!

107
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,916
Yeah, right.
I wasn't staring.

108
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,708
This weekend, we are
going to be conducting

109
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:10,291
a training camp
for all the pilots.

110
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:12,666
Make sure to bundle up
so you don't catch a cold.

111
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:13,416
All right?

112
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,125
--Alright.
--Alright.

113
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,916
I bet you tried to
sneak a peep at us

114
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,125
while we were
bathing, didn't you?

115
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:20,625
Yeah right.
Nobody even cares.

116
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:22,750
And I'm supposed
to believe that?

117
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:28,375
Are you okay?
What happened?

118
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:32,125
I'm just a little...
flushed I guess, that's all.

119
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:34,500
Hey, were you
trying to cop a feel?

120
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:36,000
No, I wouldn't do that.

121
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:38,250
You try anything
and I'll kick your butt.

122
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:40,833
Aw, come on, don't be like that.

123
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:43,291
Fieldtrips to the
beach, a festival,

124
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:45,000
and now a training camp...

125
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:46,375
Those are all
the things we tried

126
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:47,750
to do but couldn't, aren't they?

127
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:49,791
It's a difficult
time for everyone.

128
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:53,500
Besides they should have as
many good memories as possible.

129
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:55,541
You're probably right.

130
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,750
Um... by the way,
it's been awhile, and...

131
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:00,000
I think I'm late.

132
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:03,125
I don't quite follow you.
Late for what?

133
00:07:03,208 --> 00:07:04,583
I thought it was rather odd,

134
00:07:04,666 --> 00:07:06,875
because I'm usually
pretty regular...

135
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:08,708
But I should probably
wait a little longer

136
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:10,500
before talking
to mom about it.

137
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:13,625
Wait a minute,
are you telling me that yer...

138
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:15,000
If I am pregnant...

139
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:17,333
...do you think everyone
would be surprised?

140
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:18,875
Of course!

141
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:21,000
It would be the first natural
conception in thirty years.

142
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:23,166
Everyone would be thrilled.

143
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,083
If it turns out that I'm wrong,

144
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:26,708
I wonder if I'll have to use an

145
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:29,625
artificial uterus
to have a baby?

146
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:33,500
When my mother found out she
wasn't able to have children...

147
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:36,458
...she must have
been devastated.

148
00:07:36,541 --> 00:07:39,875
Have there been any changes in
Koyo since we got him back?

149
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:41,458
No.

150
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:43,375
But I've been able to study his
chromosomes and figured out a

151
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:45,166
way to slow down the
effects of the Festum

152
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:46,791
component in the other pilots.

153
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:49,208
If I didn't have access to it,
there's no way the pilots

154
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:51,166
would've been able to
fight this many battles

155
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:53,791
without being assimilated
by the Festum already.

156
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:55,583
I don't like the fact
that the enemy's been

157
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:58,041
launching an attack
every four days.

158
00:07:58,125 --> 00:07:59,708
And that's exactly
what Mitsuhiro

159
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:01,291
said would happen
before he left.

160
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:03,083
The third Festum War...

161
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:06,375
In other words,
the final battle, right?

162
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:08,875
We told the Neo U.N.
that we wouldn't participate in

163
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:11,083
their Dual Attack Offensive
against the Festum.

164
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:14,041
Maybe somehow we're
still getting dragged into it.

165
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:15,333
No...

166
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:16,791
I don't think the Neo U.N.

167
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:19,458
will launch full-scale
operations until later.

168
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,208
In this current
string of attacks,

169
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:22,708
I can't help feeling
that the enemy

170
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:24,583
has a different agenda now.

171
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:26,166
What do you mean agenda?

172
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:29,083
These things don't even have a
concept of what an operation is.

173
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:31,000
The enemy cores
have a limit at the rate

174
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:32,458
to which they can multiply.

175
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:34,291
And though we've defeated
many of their kind they keep

176
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:35,833
dispatching more
and are maintaining

177
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:37,416
a certain attack pattern.

178
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,666
Military computer programs, when
running tactical simulations,

179
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,541
will often dispatch
additional soldiers

180
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:44,250
in order to make
up for the loss.

181
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:46,500
The Festum merely
optimize their battles

182
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:47,958
just like
a computer would.

183
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:50,750
Therefore it isn't like them
to favor a specific unit.

184
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:52,291
So if the enemy's
attack patterns

185
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:54,416
have changed
significantly then...

186
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,166
Are you suggesting
that the Festum we've

187
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:58,333
been fighting are some
kind of diversion?

188
00:08:58,416 --> 00:08:59,625
That's right.

189
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:01,666
Which means that the
Festum now understand the

190
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,166
concept of "sacrifice,"

191
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:07,041
and are fighting with more
advanced strategic judgment...

192
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:10,291
Wow, your cheeks
feel so soft, Tsubaki.

193
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:12,458
When you do
that it tickles, Rina.

194
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:14,500
But the Festum feels
hard though, right?

195
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:17,500
Do parts of you feel hard
like the Festum too?

196
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:19,625
You keep your hands
off of her, you pervert!

197
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:21,041
Or else!

198
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:24,458
I bet your entire body
is soft, isn't it Tsubaki?

199
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:26,750
No fair!
She's touching her!

200
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:29,291
Yeah, Rina's always
like that with girls.

201
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:31,708
What?
A giant tailspin attack?

202
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:33,416
Absolutely not.

203
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,333
It would impose an excess
burden on our bodies.

204
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:38,708
Darn.
It's such a great move.

205
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:40,750
That's out of question.

206
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:45,833
Darn! And right when we got
to start school again too.

207
00:09:45,916 --> 00:09:47,083
I don't believe it!

208
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:48,250
Take the primary post!

209
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:50,541
Those in work groups
gather at each bloc!

210
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,416
Get out of the way.
The pilots are coming!

211
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,541
Good luck you guys!

212
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:56,250
We're counting on you!

213
00:09:56,916 --> 00:10:00,166
Way to go Maya!
You're so cool!

214
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:02,916
Don't you need to rush
over to the CDC too, Rina?

215
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,333
Right.

216
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:06,416
We're supposed to take shelter
behind the schoolhouse.

217
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,375
Huh?
Tsubaki?

218
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:13,208
The enemies this time
consist of eight sphinx-types,

219
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:15,416
and two long-range
battle D-types.

220
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,708
Give priority to
defending your five o'clock.

221
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:19,375
You'll land at main battlefield,

222
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:22,208
five kilometers
southwest from here.

223
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:26,541
Tsubaki, what are you doing?

224
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:28,083
It's too dangerous
to be out here.

225
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:29,708
You need to evacuate.

226
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:32,666
I have to watch
the battle right now .

227
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:42,541
There are no
more enemy units left.

228
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:43,916
The Fafners are returning.

229
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
It must've taken
longer this time because

230
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:48,458
they were those
long-range types, huh?

231
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:50,583
Hold on.
Wait a minute what's this?

232
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:52,125
What is it?

233
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:54,625
What is all this?

234
00:10:58,125 --> 00:10:59,791
Are they fireflies?

235
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:01,541
Where'd they come from?

236
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:02,750
This makes no sense.

237
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:05,250
There weren't
any flowers before!

238
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:07,750
Wait...
what are these?

239
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,208
The entire island...

240
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:12,625
it's suddenly filled
with all this life.

241
00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:15,250
Tsubaki!

242
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:17,500
Are you the one
doing all of this?

243
00:11:17,583 --> 00:11:20,583
No...
All I am is a part of it.

244
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:24,083
I need to teach my
MIR about life and death.

245
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:28,416
The beginning of life, when
things stop being eternal.

246
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:32,083
Birth... it's what allows for
the existence of a life full of

247
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:33,791
happiness and sadness,

248
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:38,291
that only the creatures in
this world can experience.

249
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:43,000
It's beautiful.

250
00:11:54,333 --> 00:11:56,000
Rather than having
a training camp,

251
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:57,833
I'd prefer to enjoy the view.

252
00:11:57,916 --> 00:11:59,666
How can sunflowers
and cherry blossoms

253
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:00,791
bloom in
the same season?

254
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:02,708
Yeah and the
cicadas are shrilling too.

255
00:12:02,791 --> 00:12:04,791
There doesn't seem
to be abnormalities in

256
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:07,125
the weather control or
life support systems.

257
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:09,583
Leave the problems with
the island to the specialists.

258
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:12,291
All we have to worry
about is doing our job.

259
00:12:12,375 --> 00:12:14,416
Including subspecies,
we currently have

260
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,791
data on twenty different
kinds of Festum.

261
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:18,500
As long as they're the
A through D-types,

262
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:20,833
then it's possible for us
to defend against them.

263
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:23,000
Therefore, in the future,
our task will be to

264
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:25,333
do everything to prevent any
accidents from happening.

265
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:26,708
And train to deal with the new

266
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:30,125
types of enemies that launch
simultaneous attacks.

267
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,958
Hey Mamoru, who writes that
comic you're always reading?

268
00:12:35,041 --> 00:12:36,333
Huh?

269
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:37,666
Do you know, Soshi?

270
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,666
Huh? No.

271
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:42,916
They're probably reprints
of old archived works.

272
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,583
Oh right.

273
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:46,708
Alright.

274
00:12:46,791 --> 00:12:49,166
We're about to start the second
phase of our training today.

275
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:50,875
This is part of our training?

276
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:52,875
It's about time you
learn how to do this.

277
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:55,500
And Mom's always too
busy with work to teach you.

278
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:57,875
Why don't you just take
private lessons from Kazuki?

279
00:12:57,958 --> 00:13:00,250
Why would Kazuki have
anything to do with this?

280
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:01,791
And what about you, Sakura?

281
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:03,666
I'll have you know
that I'm a great cook.

282
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,208
My mom taught me all about it.

283
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:06,541
Yeah right.

284
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:07,708
How are you doing Canon?

285
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:09,291
Hm?

286
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:11,916
Rapid absorption of nutrition
is the basis of this training.

287
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,583
Wow.

288
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:15,666
You sure are lucky Miss Yumiko.

289
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,333
You have someone to rely on.

290
00:13:17,416 --> 00:13:18,875
I do? Who's that?

291
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:20,500
I'm talking about Michio!

292
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:22,708
He gives the impression
of being a real adult.

293
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:24,500
Like a real man, you know?

294
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:25,875
You think so?

295
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:27,833
It wasn't too long ago when
he was just a helpless

296
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:31,125
attention-craving coward, and a
good-for-nothing woman chaser.

297
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:32,208
Then...

298
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:33,833
...why did you agree to
go out with him?

299
00:13:33,916 --> 00:13:35,208
Hmm...

300
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:37,750
Although he was a mess,
he was always

301
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:39,291
showing off and
then screwing up.

302
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:41,541
And I guess I
found that interesting...

303
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:43,291
That's too funny if you ask me.

304
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:46,708
And the fact that he's easy
to look at doesn't hurt either.

305
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,166
Besides, it was
obvious that he was

306
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:50,916
going out of his
way to woo me...

307
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,208
There aren't any
cases like this on file.

308
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:56,916
It's possible for it to result
in a sudden reactionary change.

309
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,708
Is that so...

310
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:00,583
You know, Commander...

311
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:03,458
I really don't mind going
to meet you next time.

312
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:04,958
No, it's all right.

313
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:07,833
Besides it's not really my style
to be summoning people.

314
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:10,250
Kyosuke's says that I
act too hastily and that

315
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:11,916
I'm not like a commander at all.

316
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,875
That's not what
I was getting at.

317
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:16,791
Besides,
I don't think that's true.

318
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:23,750
Yeah!
I got it!

319
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:26,375
That makes the fifth
straight loss for Kazuki.

320
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:27,208
Tough luck.

321
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:28,458
Kazuki...

322
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:30,625
You're really not very
good at this, are you?

323
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:31,958
No...

324
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:34,208
Now then, I'm going to
assign all of you cleaning

325
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:37,166
duties based on these
tournament standings.

326
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,125
Okay!

327
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:42,291
Check back on the
water in fifteen minutes.

328
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:43,916
Roger that!

329
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,916
Don't you still have
to go and help Kazuki?

330
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,125
He's going to have
to deal with his own loss.

331
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:50,125
Besides, I'm pretty
sure that someone else

332
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:52,833
is already helping
him out by now.

333
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:54,708
See what I mean?

334
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:55,958
How did you know that?

335
00:14:56,041 --> 00:14:58,125
Just had a hunch.

336
00:14:58,208 --> 00:15:01,041
Do you think Kazuki's the
reason Maya's fighting?

337
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:02,916
Did Maya tell you
that or something?

338
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,625
No.
Just call it a hunch.

339
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:07,750
If it's true then
it's news to me.

340
00:15:07,833 --> 00:15:10,666
I thought the system allowed you
to sense the feelings of others.

341
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:13,666
Yeah, in a way I know what her
motivations for fighting are.

342
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:15,666
They're obligation
and loneliness.

343
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:18,666
It really bothered her that she
wasn't able to pilot a Fafner.

344
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,666
So you can tell
what we're feeling.

345
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,916
It would be arrogant of me
to claim I was able to

346
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,666
fully understand
others because of it.

347
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:28,166
Maya was the
one who taught me that.

348
00:15:28,916 --> 00:15:30,750
My number is seven.

349
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:32,500
And your number is eighteen.

350
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:33,791
Whaddya mean?

351
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:36,833
It's the number of
Festum we've each defeated.

352
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:39,250
Kazuki's at sixty-two...

353
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:41,208
 I'll never catch up to him.

354
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:43,541
I guess that I'm just no good.

355
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:46,000
I thought that I would be
able to avenge my father

356
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:48,625
by defeating as many
enemies as possible.

357
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:53,041
However, I didn't become strong
enough to do that in the end.

358
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:57,916
Don't worry. I'll do it.
I'll become like your father!

359
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,041
I'll become stronger.
Stronger than even Kazuki.

360
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:02,083
Yeah right.

361
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:03,583
It's not like
you're my boyfriend.

362
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:05,416
You don't have to be like that.

363
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:08,333
Fine.
Then let go of my hand.

364
00:16:08,916 --> 00:16:10,958
You don't need to
go out of your way.

365
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:12,708
I'm not doing that.

366
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:13,916
You are, too!

367
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,541
You're a just helpless coward,

368
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:17,333
an attention-craving
woman chaser.

369
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:20,041
And you're nothing
like my dad, okay?!

370
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:22,416
So don't go out
of your way for me.

371
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,791
Cuz if I ever lost you...

372
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:26,583
I told you that's
not what I'm doing!

373
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:31,375
In that case then...
Could you...

374
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:33,416
...please hold my
hand some more.

375
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,291
Uh yeah, sure.

376
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,750
Operation creating
new memories...

377
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:44,916
I'd say the success rate was 50
percent, wouldn't you agree?

378
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,750
You know I can
just imagine it now,

379
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:49,041
the way you're going to
end up raising this child.

380
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:51,916
Shouldn't we be coming up
with baby names, just in case?

381
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,166
Before that we've got
something else to address.

382
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,750
The issue of your last name.

383
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:57,208
Huh?

384
00:16:57,291 --> 00:16:59,583
Pretty soon I won't be able
to pilot a Fafner anymore.

385
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:02,125
If I manage to make it to
my retirement in one piece,

386
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:05,291
why don't we make
this thing official?

387
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:07,208
Stop it.
Don't be ridiculous.

388
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:10,375
You've always kept your promise
so you have to make it through.

389
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:11,916
If you don't you'd be a liar.

390
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,791
 Yeah, you're right.

391
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:17,666
Hm?

392
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:20,291
Hey. I hope you don't
mind, I decided to help myself.

393
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:22,916
I'm sorry for making you wait.

394
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,458
That's the maintenance
record from the

395
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:26,625
facilities where
Koyo Kasugai is.

396
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:28,125
I'm sure it's been
completely altered.

397
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:29,541
It's far too clean.

398
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:31,041
It's just as I suspected.

399
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:33,416
She's the one who altered
the freezing procedure.

400
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,083
Then that means
that all of our actions

401
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:37,125
on the island are
being monitored...

402
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:40,125
Tsubaki Minashiro
knows about them all.

403
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:41,500
What a shame.

404
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:43,458
And after I went through
all that trouble to get it.

405
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:45,791
Festums and
humans co-existing...

406
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:47,958
Do you think that it's possible?

407
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:49,083
I don't know.

408
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:50,625
Our generation was different.

409
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:52,291
We hated the enemy too much.

410
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:54,125
And that's probably how
we ended up with a guy

411
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:57,083
like Mitsuhiro representing
our generation.

412
00:17:57,166 --> 00:17:59,875
If I didn't have Kazuki,
I would've ended up

413
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:02,375
choosing the
same path.

414
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,291
His hand...

415
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:12,333
...it was bigger
than I thought it'd be.

416
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:14,833
Oh great.

417
00:18:14,916 --> 00:18:16,666
He filled my mind with
such silly thoughts

418
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:19,166
that now I have a headache.

419
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:21,166
I'm home!

420
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:22,166
Where are they?

421
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:24,708
Did mom and dad
go to the hanger?

422
00:18:27,916 --> 00:18:30,708
G-Goubain.

423
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:34,166
He didn't mean to
intentionally deceive you...

424
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:36,708
You have to understand
that he was merely trying

425
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:39,416
to do something for
you as a father.

426
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,708
You know, when you were
a babe there were virtually

427
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:44,333
no forms of entertainment
on the island.

428
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:47,250
So when you cried because
you wanted to read comics,

429
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:50,083
we were forced to
reproduce them from scratch.

430
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:53,208
Do you mean to say he was
copying old comics from memory?

431
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:54,708
Well, yes, at first.

432
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:57,208
But after awhile he started
talking about how it wasn't

433
00:18:57,291 --> 00:19:00,250
a genuine gift if he didn't
actually create it himself.

434
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:01,916
He sacrificed many nights

435
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,875
of sleep in order to
perfect his craft.

436
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:07,416
Now, he draws the Goubain
series all by himself.

437
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:10,208
Anko Otsubu is the one and only

438
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:12,125
true cartoonist
from this island.

439
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:16,916
And he was born to please
just you and no one else.

440
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:19,583
I'm sleepy.

441
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:22,458
But I can never sleep
without my own pillow.

442
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:23,625
Kenji.

443
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:25,416
Did you confess your
feelings to Sakura?

444
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,500
Huh?

445
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:27,833
I don't think Sakura's
the kind of girl

446
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:29,583
who likes it when
things are vague.

447
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:30,666
Shut up, stupid!

448
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,416
And why are you
bringing this up now?

449
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,583
We don't know even
if we're going to be

450
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:35,583
coming back from
this battle alive?

451
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:37,916
You and Sakura will have
nothing to worry about.

452
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
You'll come back safe,
I'm gonna make sure of it.

453
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:42,958
Ms. Yazama!

454
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:44,875
What is it, Mamoru?
Something wrong?

455
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:47,375
I was wondering if you could
please keep this for me?

456
00:19:47,458 --> 00:19:49,583
But that's your...
Are you sure?

457
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:51,916
I'd really appreciate it.

458
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:57,916
Well, that took l less time
than usual, didn't it?

459
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,166
And there were a lot
of them today too.

460
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:02,500
Hey, Mamoru.
What's wrong?

461
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:04,333
It was... scary...

462
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:05,791
Everyone...

463
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:06,833
...you always...

464
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:08,458
...do so much
during the battles.

465
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:09,958
Mamoru.

466
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:13,333
Hey, Do you think that I
can become strong too?

467
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:16,791
Do you think I can be
strong like everyone else?

468
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:18,875
Of course I do.

469
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:24,708
All right Sakura.

470
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:27,291
What?
What do you want from me now?

471
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:28,375
Uh...

472
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:30,958
Meet me after
school tomorrow alright?

473
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:38,625
What is it?
A love letter?

474
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:41,541
A challenge...
to Kazuki Makabe?

475
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:43,083
Looks like It's from Kenji.

476
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:45,708
It's been awhile since
I got one of these.

477
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:47,000
Do you always play along when he

478
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:48,708
sends you one of
these challenges?

479
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:50,708
Yeah, ever since
he called me a coward.

480
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:52,333
Why don't you
just try losing to him.

481
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:54,666
It's been Kenji's dream
to confess his feelings

482
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,375
to Sakura after defeating you.

483
00:20:56,458 --> 00:20:57,875
So let him.

484
00:20:57,958 --> 00:21:00,416
Hey Maya, I'm sorry but would
you mind leaving us alone?

485
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,875
Huh?
And why's that?

486
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:04,833
Because he said so, that's why.

487
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:06,833
What'd you say?

488
00:21:07,916 --> 00:21:11,166
I'll be judging the match so
that you pilots won't get hurt.

489
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:13,041
We'll be playing by
the same set of rules

490
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:14,458
as in a simulation fight.

491
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:16,041
Is that all right?

492
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:18,666
Kenji challenged
Kazuki for you...

493
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,916
Hmm, I'm not sure about that.

494
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,083
I really envy you, Sakura.

495
00:21:23,166 --> 00:21:27,166
You know the thing I really like
about you is your honesty.

496
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:29,833
You used to have a thing
for Michio, didn't you?

497
00:21:29,916 --> 00:21:32,125
I'm not sure.
Maybe I guess.

498
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:35,416
And now you're starting to
like Kazuki a bit, am I right?

499
00:21:35,958 --> 00:21:37,458
Why would you say that?

500
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:38,875
It was just a hunch.

501
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:40,458
But my hunches
are usually right.

502
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:43,708
Don't you have an appointment to
meet with Kenji right about now?

503
00:21:43,791 --> 00:21:45,041
Hmm...

504
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:47,833
I don't think the fight's
over yet, but oh well.

505
00:21:48,291 --> 00:21:52,750
I'll go there and cheer him on.
Just like if I was his girl.

506
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:56,541
I guess that's the way boys are.

507
00:21:56,625 --> 00:22:00,000
Hang in there...
Hang in there boys...

508
00:22:05,708 --> 00:22:07,125
What is this?

509
00:22:08,958 --> 00:22:11,125
My mind... it's...

510
00:22:11,208 --> 00:22:13,250
...it's disappearing...

511
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:17,250
No!
Please no!

512
00:22:19,666 --> 00:22:23,291
Kenji! Kenji!

513
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:25,500
Kenji...

514
00:22:30,333 --> 00:22:35,291
♪ closing song ♪

515
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:41,041
The light is gone.

516
00:23:42,125 --> 00:23:46,083
Our feelings try to
make up for the loss.

517
00:23:47,541 --> 00:23:49,833
I'll do something about it...

518
00:23:51,291 --> 00:23:56,333
Next on Fafner episode
number twenty-two.

519
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:57,875
"Power."

520
00:23:59,458 --> 00:24:01,083
Are you there?
