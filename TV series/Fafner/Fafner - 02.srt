1
00:00:17,333 --> 00:00:18,875
Have they found us...?

2
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:20,875
But what is this place?!?

3
00:00:21,416 --> 00:00:23,208
It's Alvis...

4
00:00:29,541 --> 00:00:30,291
Makabe...

5
00:00:30,375 --> 00:00:31,916
Take charge while I'm gone.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,833
This is Fafner. Kazuki...

7
00:00:33,916 --> 00:00:35,791
I want you to use
it to protect the island!

8
00:00:35,875 --> 00:00:36,916
That's impossible!

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:37,916
It's up to you now!

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,875
You're the only
one who can do it!

11
00:00:40,458 --> 00:00:41,958
I can, huh?

12
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:43,125
Soshi...

13
00:00:43,208 --> 00:00:44,666
Y'really think so?

14
00:00:45,875 --> 00:00:48,500
Think so? I know so!

15
00:00:55,625 --> 00:01:00,583
♪ opening song ♪

16
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,250
Fafner Mark Elf... ready!

17
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:29,750
Lift off!

18
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,250
Fafner is on the ground.

19
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:51,708
Landing confirmed.

20
00:02:51,791 --> 00:02:53,250
Disengage auto pilot.

21
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:55,250
As of now,
Pilot Nibelungen will be

22
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:57,083
in control of the Mark Elf 

23
00:02:58,291 --> 00:02:59,833
Kazuki.

24
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:06,166
Where's am i?

25
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:07,750
You're on Keiju Island.

26
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:09,375
We've got a secure
storage hangar there

27
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:11,541
that houses all
Fafner-related equipment.

28
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:13,375
Watch out!
Here it comes!!

29
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:16,458
So that's the enemy...?

30
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:18,583
That thing...

31
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:19,666
...up there?

32
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,291
Are you there?

33
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:23,208
It can talk??

34
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:24,541
Don't answer!

35
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:26,458
It'll invade your mind
and leave you defenseless!

36
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:27,833
Are you there?

37
00:03:30,291 --> 00:03:32,041
Are you there?

38
00:03:33,541 --> 00:03:36,833
If you answer,
the human race is finished.

39
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:41,208
Can't move it!

40
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:43,250
Can't move my body...!

41
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:46,166
It's not working!

42
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:52,291
Kazuki!

43
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:54,166
Feel Fafner itself!

44
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:56,000
Unite with it!

45
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:05,166
It read my move!

46
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:13,000
The weapons
are unlocked now, sir.

47
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:16,166
But the only one that'll do
us any good is the Rail Gun.

48
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:18,500
Then we've no choice.

49
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:21,958
Have the Rail Gun transported to
Lindwurm Catapult immediately.

50
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:23,125
Hm?!

51
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:25,500
We can't use the
runways on Takeru Island.

52
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:27,583
We'll have to send it
to him directly from here.

53
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:28,833
Right.

54
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:30,500
Activating Lindwurm's
Missile Delivery System.

55
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:31,833
Just one thing, sir--

56
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:34,333
We have no way of
controlling the thing from here.

57
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:35,875
Yes...

58
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:38,375
I'm aware of that...

59
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:41,833
Where is it?!?

60
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:43,291
Right behind you!

61
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:46,208
What's it doing??

62
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:48,000
He's trying to assimilate you!

63
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:49,500
Pull him off and
get away from him!

64
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:50,833
Hurry!

65
00:04:56,958 --> 00:04:58,208
Activating pain block!

66
00:04:58,291 --> 00:05:00,166
Cutting off left arm!

67
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,041
Damn, it won't move!

68
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:13,041
Talk to me, Soshi!

69
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:14,041
What's goin' on??

70
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:15,166
I don't know!

71
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,583
All of sudden your
signal was cut off!

72
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:17,875
Get outta there, Kazuki!

73
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:19,500
Eject!
Eject!

74
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:20,416
Kazuki!

75
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,291
Use the Rail Gun!

76
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:25,000
With Fafner off-line,

77
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:27,166
you won't have the power
you need to reload the gun...

78
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:28,750
...so you'll only have one shot!

79
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:30,125
Father?!

80
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,708
Good.

81
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:36,291
It's up to you...

82
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:48,625
Kazuki, take the Rail Gun!

83
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:20,541
The target's completely
disappeared, sir.

84
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:22,250
Pilot's survival is confirmed.

85
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:23,750
Retrieve the cockpit stat.

86
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:25,875
And give me a damage report.

87
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:27,541
Mrs. Kaname?!

88
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:29,291
Yes sir!

89
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:32,458
About 60% of the Keiju Island
facility is badly damaged.

90
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:34,291
On Takeru Island,
they lost parts

91
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:36,791
of two runways and some
secondary equipment.

92
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:39,125
There's widespread
damage, then...

93
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:40,250
And Tatsumiya?

94
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,583
13 homes destroyed,
28 people missing.

95
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:45,333
Reports claim 2 of the
28 were found unharmed.

96
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:47,375
They're survival
has been confirmed.

97
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:50,958
The Interception Array at
Mukojima no longer exists.

98
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:52,708
This...

99
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:54,666
...this...

100
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,541
...is our island?

101
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:00,708
You're kidding.

102
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:02,583
No way!

103
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:38,958
Soshi, I am sorry
about your father.

104
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:41,166
He was a brave man.

105
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:43,541
How would you rate the
new Commander Makabe?

106
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:46,041
Do you think
his tactics are sound?

107
00:07:46,541 --> 00:07:48,375
Under the circumstances...

108
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:52,583
I think every decision he made
was exactly on the money.

109
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:54,583
Is that so?

110
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:59,583
But, what if you'd been in
command of that mission...?

111
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:02,041
I'm not really
interested in "what if's."

112
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:03,791
They're a waste of time.

113
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:06,708
Well, nevertheless, it's over.

114
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:08,791
So, what are you gonna do now?

115
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:14,875
Look, I...

116
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:17,166
I know how busy you are, so...

117
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,083
Well, then,
if you'll excuse me,

118
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:21,500
I'd better get back to work...

119
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:50,625
So, what've we got?

120
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:52,000
How is he?

121
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:54,750
Oh...

122
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:58,208
The results are no surprise,
you knew what to expect.

123
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:04,625
There, we're all done!

124
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:06,916
Now, I'd like you to go home
and get a good night's rest.

125
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,333
Alright.

126
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:12,958
Hey, what's the matter?

127
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:15,125
Well, it's just that...

128
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:19,583
I didn't know a
place like this existed.

129
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:21,458
Well, then, I suggest
you ask your father

130
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:23,666
about it when you get back home.

131
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:25,875
You mean my Dad knows about...

132
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:27,541
this place...?

133
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:29,583
All right...

134
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:32,125
I've got a lotta injured
people to look at so go on,

135
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:33,708
get outta here, will ya?!

136
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:35,000
 Oh, right...

137
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:39,125
Thank you very
much for all your help.

138
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,958
Take care, now...

139
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:48,833
We'll hafta tell Mr. Makabe.

140
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:50,625
Do you want me to make the call?

141
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:52,500
No, not yet.

142
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:55,250
Please, just give me a
little more time, alright?

143
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:03,166
Shoko!!

144
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:05,166
Hey, are you alright?!?

145
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,166
Man, am I glad to see YOU!

146
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,375
Are you injured?

147
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:10,041
We're fine, thanks.

148
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:12,625
Koyo, do you...

149
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:14,833
...do you know...

150
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:16,500
What, Shoko?

151
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:18,375
Where Kazuki is??

152
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:19,875
Kazuki?

153
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:22,583
Oh, I think he's alright, Shoko!

154
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:25,416
Good, I'm glad!

155
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,750
So, Shoko...

156
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:30,333
Yeah?

157
00:10:30,416 --> 00:10:32,583
Do ya think you'll be able to
come back to school tomorrow?

158
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:35,291
Mm-hm!
Yes, I'll be there for sure!

159
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:37,625
It's getting late,
dear, let's go inside.

160
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:40,208
Thank you for all
your help, Maya dear.

161
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:41,250
It was my pleasure!

162
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:42,916
Meow.

163
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:46,583
Coo!

164
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:51,291
See ya tomorrow then!

165
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:53,625
Get some rest tonight, okay?

166
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:56,375
I thank you both for
everything you've done.

167
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:58,208
Well, good night, you two.

168
00:10:58,291 --> 00:10:59,666
Dear...?

169
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:02,083
You really helped her out.

170
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:03,250
Thanks, Maya.

171
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:04,750
Sure.

172
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,791
I'm h-o-m-e!

173
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:13,541
Oh!
Welcome back, son.

174
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:16,458
Hey there, Mom--
What are you doing?

175
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:18,916
I'm glad to see
that you're alright.

176
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,541
Where did ya get
all that crazy stuff?

177
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:23,000
Now don't be rude, dear.

178
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:24,291
These are all mine here.

179
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:25,666
Huh?

180
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:38,291
I can't seem to find my house.

181
00:11:39,791 --> 00:11:41,458
That's why ya
gotta hang in there!

182
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:42,666
You're right!

183
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:43,958
You know our family
name is Kasugai, right?

184
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:45,291
Which means we
could be seeing some

185
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:47,666
activity and
some benefits!

186
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:51,583
I'm serious, that's no joke!

187
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,375
Glad to see ya, Chocolate!

188
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:05,250
How ya doin buddy?

189
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:09,416
Mom, I'm home!

190
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,500
Mom...?

191
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Mom?

192
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:16,833
What's wrong?
It's so dark in here...

193
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:19,583
Why aren't any of the lights on?

194
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:22,083
Sakura...

195
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:24,208
It's your Father.

196
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:26,166
Your Father was...

197
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:27,750
Just say it, Mom.

198
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:29,791
What happened to Dad?

199
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:47,041
Soshi.

200
00:13:15,541 --> 00:13:18,708
So what did you think
about piloting Fafner?

201
00:13:22,916 --> 00:13:24,833
Nothing special...

202
00:13:24,916 --> 00:13:26,291
You must've been surprised...

203
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:27,750
...to learn that the
people of this island

204
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:29,708
were involved
in all this weirdness.

205
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:31,333
Pretty strange, huh?

206
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:32,916
Not really.

207
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:34,916
No?

208
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,750
Then what about the fact that
Japan doesn't exist anymore?

209
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:40,500
"It doesn't exist???"

210
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:43,208
It was destroyed 29 years ago.

211
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:44,541
You mean Tokyo...

212
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:45,916
...and Osaka, are...?

213
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,875
...are gone, been
gone for a long time.

214
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:49,916
And in a way...

215
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,916
Tatsumiya Island
disappeared, too--

216
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,625
You won't find it on any map.

217
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:59,041
Still don't believe it?
Then look around!

218
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:01,916
Those weapons are there
for a reason, Kazuki...!

219
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:05,958
To keep this place the
way it's supposed to be.

220
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:08,583
Y'see, up until yesterday...

221
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:12,958
...this island was the only
paradise still left on Earth.

222
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:32,625
Huh?!

223
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:44,250
I owe my life to this island...

224
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:48,500
No, I really owe it to
men like your father, Soshi!

225
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:50,083
They'll be back, y'know...

226
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:51,125
Hm?

227
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:54,416
Ya with me?

228
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,375
You will fight them
with me, won't you...

229
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:58,000
...Kazuki?

230
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:08,500
Thanks for coming all the
way out here to see me today.

231
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:12,166
There's something about
Kazuki's physical condition

232
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:14,708
that you and I
need to talk about...

233
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:20,083
I'm h-o-m-e!

234
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,166
Sorry I'm late!

235
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:28,916
The teachers' meeting took
a lot longer than I expected...

236
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,708
I always know when you're lying.

237
00:15:30,791 --> 00:15:32,708
Like right now.

238
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:36,250
I'm getting the feeling
you're angry at me...

239
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:40,500
Guess I was right!

240
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:44,500
I'm home.

241
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:45,875
Hmm?

242
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:49,750
So whatta ya think?

243
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:53,250
Mrs. Tohmi gave it to me.
It's pretty nice, huh?

244
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:56,708
Ya think it's funny?

245
00:15:56,791 --> 00:15:58,125
No!

246
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,791
It's just that I'm glad
you came back--

247
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:02,166
I didn't expect
to see you.

248
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:03,625
Well of COURSE I came back!

249
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:05,083
As if I had any choice!

250
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:07,916
You couldn't cook up a bowl
of RICE without me around!

251
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:10,916
I used to cook rice a
long time ago, y'know!

252
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,458
Yeah. That was before
you were married, right?

253
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:16,333
Outta the way!--I'LL
be cooking tonight!

254
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:20,416
Let's see what we got here...

255
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:27,750
Aren't you going home?

256
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:31,541
Home?

257
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:33,708
Y'mean my "house?"
That's not the same

258
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:36,500
as a "home," at least not to me.

259
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:39,125
Besides, I feel
at home right here.

260
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:41,125
I understand.

261
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:46,083
Oh, and about that
"what if" situation...

262
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:48,833
You asked, if I
would've also done the

263
00:16:48,916 --> 00:16:51,791
same thing if I'd had
been in command.

264
00:16:53,291 --> 00:16:56,833
The answer's "no."
I would've done it a lot better.

265
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:58,708
I'm counting on that.

266
00:16:58,791 --> 00:17:00,958
You wouldn't have been
assigned to the CDC if former

267
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:04,333
Commander Minashiro hadn't
seen that quality in you...

268
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:08,708
...because after all,
he brought you on board.

269
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,875
Thanks for making us the food.

270
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:26,625
Hm?

271
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:27,625
Well, how is it?

272
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:29,125
Does it taste okay?

273
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:32,958
I had no idea you could screw
up cooking rice this bad.

274
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:34,666
Huh?

275
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:41,000
I'm going to bed.

276
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:43,041
Yeah, okay.

277
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:44,583
Hey, Dad...

278
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,375
Yeah?

279
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:47,958
Have you known all along...

280
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:49,833
...about this island?

281
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:54,708
I kept it a secret.

282
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:56,500
Don't ask me why.

283
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:00,541
I, uh...

284
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:03,500
...made my decision to
fight to protect the island.

285
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,541
I'm gonna help Soshi.

286
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:07,625
I see...

287
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:11,833
So Miss Tohmi
hasn't told you yet?

288
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:13,208
You should go to bed.

289
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:15,166
Your Fafner training
sessions will begin early,

290
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:17,125
so you should get some rest.

291
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:39,208
There's something about
Kazuki's physical condition

292
00:18:39,291 --> 00:18:41,541
that you and I
need to talk about...

293
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:45,458
When he was piloting Fafner,
we recorded some unusual changes

294
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:48,666
in the wave patterns emitted
by certain areas of the brain...

295
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:51,541
We also found that,
sometime during that battle,

296
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:54,750
the internal structure of his
chromosomes had changed.

297
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:56,291
We'll have to
observe him for a while

298
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:58,375
before reaching
a realistic prognosis.

299
00:18:58,458 --> 00:18:59,625
However...

300
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:02,541
...if he continues
like this, then...

301
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:09,083
Akane...

302
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:10,750
I'm sorry...

303
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:13,916
I'm so sorry...!

304
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:20,375
Did you know that
Kuramae was a pilot?

305
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:22,916
That she knows how
to fly those huge robots?

306
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,166
That must be why
she didn't evacuate with us.

307
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:27,250
Yeah well did she fight?

308
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:28,458
I don't know.

309
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:30,541
All I know is
what my Dad told me,

310
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:33,250
and all he said
was that she was a pilot.

311
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:36,958
The question is,
will I be able to fly Fafner.

312
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:42,250
Are you serious??

313
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:44,583
You could die tryin'
to pilot that thing!

314
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:46,125
Maybe, but...

315
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:48,791
Kazuki Makabe did it, didn't he?

316
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:59,041
Yeah, looks like he did...

317
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:03,625
Soshi and Kazuki
have been spending

318
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:05,625
an awful lot of time
in the base lately.

319
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:07,000
Oh!

320
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:10,458
I wish that~I could
go with him, Maya!

321
00:20:10,541 --> 00:20:12,291
Kazuki or Soshi?

322
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:15,416
Uhh...

323
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:21,166
Kazuki seems to be working
hard, don'tcha think so?

324
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:31,000
Now then, take off all
your clothes and come inside.

325
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:32,458
All of'em??

326
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:34,791
Put them in the
laundry box behind you.

327
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:37,958
They'll be cleaned and returned
to you when you get back.

328
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:44,458
That light will kill any

329
00:20:44,541 --> 00:20:46,208
microscopic bugs
you're carrying.

330
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:49,375
Just keep looking straight
ahead and move forward.

331
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:53,583
Don't worry, all I can
see is your face!

332
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:56,833
Uhh...

333
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,125
Will it hurt like it
did the last time?

334
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:02,291
As long as you're wearing
this synergetic suit,

335
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:04,458
you've got nothing
to worry about.

336
00:21:04,541 --> 00:21:06,875
"Synergetic suit", huh...?

337
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:16,708
Nice material...

338
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:26,375
"Nothin' to
worry about", huh?!?

339
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:35,375
I've been meaning to ask you,
have you told him about, "that."

340
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:38,833
Oh, I see...

341
00:21:38,916 --> 00:21:40,708
Soshi, the transfer's completed.

342
00:21:40,791 --> 00:21:43,041
I uploaded all of the data
from the previous battle,

343
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:45,000
including the stats
from the cockpit.

344
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:46,708
If I input the
data from every battle

345
00:21:46,791 --> 00:21:49,166
the same way it'll
make each one easier.

346
00:21:49,583 --> 00:21:50,375
Alright.

347
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:51,625
Let's get started then.

348
00:21:51,708 --> 00:21:54,833
Begin the Mark Elf
battle system test!

349
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:04,166
Siegfried System...

350
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:05,833
Activate.

351
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:13,958
When people are informed they

352
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:16,333
will know that the
world has limits.

353
00:22:16,791 --> 00:22:18,083
They will know
that human abilities

354
00:22:18,166 --> 00:22:19,875
also have their limits.

355
00:22:19,958 --> 00:22:22,791
And that their dreams
may not be realized.

356
00:22:23,166 --> 00:22:26,500
But we believed we could
overcome those things.

357
00:22:26,583 --> 00:22:28,708
We thought we
were invulnerable...

358
00:22:29,833 --> 00:22:32,458
At least, we did then...

359
00:22:33,958 --> 00:22:38,916
♪ closing song ♪

360
00:23:35,125 --> 00:23:36,375
Life...

361
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:37,791
Life is doubt.

362
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:40,625
Life is delight.

363
00:23:40,708 --> 00:23:43,000
And Life is a puzzle.

364
00:23:43,083 --> 00:23:45,208
Together, we can do this.

365
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:47,875
Up!
Go UP!

366
00:23:48,625 --> 00:23:50,208
The reality...

367
00:23:50,291 --> 00:23:52,666
...which we did
not want to know.

368
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:56,625
On the next Fafner,
Episode number three...

369
00:23:57,583 --> 00:23:59,166
Truth.

370
00:24:00,291 --> 00:24:02,041
 Are you there?
