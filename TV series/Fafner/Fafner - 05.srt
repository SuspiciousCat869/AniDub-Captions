1
00:00:13,958 --> 00:00:15,416
Start the engines now!

2
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:16,750
Prepare to start the engines!

3
00:00:16,833 --> 00:00:18,791
Internal pressure of
engines increasing.

4
00:00:18,875 --> 00:00:21,833
Engine numbers one through
six are showing no problems.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,083
All of the pre--sailing phases
have been completed.

6
00:00:32,875 --> 00:00:35,708
What do they think
that they're trying to do?

7
00:00:36,166 --> 00:00:38,208
I can't believe
we're really at war.

8
00:00:38,291 --> 00:00:39,791
We are not at school!

9
00:00:46,208 --> 00:00:49,416
It seems that she
has completely awakened.

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,958

11
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:05,583
Soshi!

12
00:03:10,666 --> 00:03:12,500
You're a pilot candidate now.

13
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:15,375
You should refrain
from this kind of hobby.

14
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:19,250
This is a personal hobby.
It's none of your business.

15
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:20,625
If something were
to happen to you

16
00:03:20,708 --> 00:03:23,375
it could interfere
with our missions.

17
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:28,166
I didn't know you came
out to places like this.

18
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:33,000
I came here because I heard
that Kazuki comes here a lot.

19
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,291
And so I thought that I should

20
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:37,708
see what it's like
here for myself.

21
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:42,208
You really want to understand
how Kazuki feels that much?

22
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:45,833
What if I did,
Is that such a bad thing?

23
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:01,916
Commander.

24
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,916
We are being hailed
by the Neo U.N...

25
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:09,791
Report the current location
of the Neo U.N.'s submarine.

26
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:12,166
Presently, it is still
trailing Alvis at a

27
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:15,041
distance of about 50 kilometers.

28
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:20,541
What would you like me to do?

29
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:22,375
Open communications.

30
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:27,750
I finally get a chance to talk
to all of you there at API1.

31
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:30,000
It's been a long time coming.

32
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:32,666
I'm the Neo UN's
Secretary General.

33
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,708
My name is Hester Gallop.

34
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:37,416
I am the one in charge of
representatiing Alvis,

35
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,583
I am Fumihiko Makabe.

36
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:42,000
Please, Commander Makabe...

37
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:45,833
We share responsibility and
now we must work together

38
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:48,875
so that we may protect humanity.

39
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:50,875
That is our sole request.

40
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:52,958
Surely you can see
that it's imperative

41
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:55,666
that you join our efforts.

42
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:59,000
All right then, we have one too.

43
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:00,000
Hmm?

44
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:01,541
Our demand is this...

45
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:02,958
...that the Neo U.N. stop

46
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:05,666
interfering with this
island completely.

47
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:09,250
How dare you.

48
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:13,083
Do you understand how selfish
you people are being right now?

49
00:05:14,791 --> 00:05:17,875
To have such power
in your possession...

50
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:20,916
Do you think we'd allow you
not to cooperate with us...

51
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,333
...that you actually have
a choice in the matter?

52
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:28,291
And...
what if we rejected you?

53
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:33,958
Commander Makabe, how could
you possibly reject us?

54
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:46,541
So then...

55
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:48,125
...did you agree to
all of their terms?

56
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:49,500
Yeah.

57
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:54,041
We will hand over the
Mark Zex to the Neo U.N.

58
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:56,166
But... You can't!

59
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:57,375
Damn it!

60
00:05:57,458 --> 00:05:59,375
Do you know how
many years of hard labor

61
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:01,250
it took to complete
the Mark Zex?

62
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:05,333
Well, for now, we have no choice
but to accept their conditions.

63
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:10,291
A convoy ship, from the Neo
U.N. will be arriving at Alvis.

64
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:12,166
It comes day after tomorrow.

65
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:15,875
I want you to move the Mark
Zex over to Muko Island.

66
00:06:16,416 --> 00:06:18,666
We don't have time
to be depressed.

67
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:22,750
Make final modifications on both
the Mark Drei and Mark Vier.

68
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:24,833
Yes, sir.

69
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:30,166
The Neo U.N...

70
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:33,500
...what on Earth do
they want from us?

71
00:06:35,458 --> 00:06:37,166
It can't be!

72
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:40,541
I actually think
this is very possible.

73
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:43,166
Have you talked to
Dr. Tohmi about this yet?

74
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:45,666
Not yet, I haven't
had a chance to.

75
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,208
However...

76
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:48,458
...there might be
some meddlesome

77
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:50,333
person behind all this.

78
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:52,333
We'll need to be extra careful.

79
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:55,833
Disconnect the data link
to the Brunhilde system.

80
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:57,458
Yes.
I understand.

81
00:07:02,916 --> 00:07:05,833
Are you okay?
Do you feel all right?

82
00:07:05,916 --> 00:07:07,708
Oh don't worry, I'm fine.

83
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:09,958
Then...
we should go.

84
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:12,750
Please Maya,
can we wait a bit longer?

85
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:16,666
I just know that Kazuki
will be coming here real soon.

86
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:21,250
Oh.

87
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:23,208
It's Soshi!

88
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:26,041
Isn't Kazuki here yet?

89
00:07:26,916 --> 00:07:28,291
I don't know.

90
00:07:32,916 --> 00:07:33,875
Maya.

91
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:35,208
Huh?

92
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:37,625
Take a look--you still have
chalk on your hands.

93
00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:44,958
Did you see that Maya?

94
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:47,500
It seems like Soshi's
got his eye on you.

95
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:48,625
Uh...

96
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:51,583
I don't think it's
anything like that.

97
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:02,916
Hey, Kazuki.
We've gotta go this way today.

98
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:05,333
But why?

99
00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:07,250
Before you can
do the simulation,

100
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:09,750
you still have to
finish your training.

101
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,000
Do you understand that?

102
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:21,375
Hey guys what are
you two doing here?

103
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:24,416
It's you, Koyo...

104
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:27,125
You all right, Shoko?

105
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:29,125
You're looking
a little bit pale.

106
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:31,125
I don't think so.
I'm fine.

107
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:33,791
Okay... If you say so...

108
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:39,708
Shoko!

109
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:41,000
Shoko!

110
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:46,458
She's suffering
from a mild anemia.

111
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:48,041
There's no need to worry though.

112
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:50,166
She's gonna be just fine.

113
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:51,791
Thank goodness.

114
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:53,041
Thanks Koyo.

115
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:54,625
Sorry about this.

116
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:55,875
With all that's going on,

117
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:58,958
Shoko seems to have
overworked herself.

118
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:00,833
She probably doesn't mind.

119
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:04,000
I bet she's having
the time of her life.

120
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:09,375
Considering Shoko's
physical condition...

121
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:11,791
I'd like her to take a little
break for the time being.

122
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:13,666
I really think it would
in the best interest

123
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,916
for both her and the project.

124
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:20,666
Will you at least please
think it over then?

125
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:23,250
It's impossible.

126
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:26,375
Tell me...
is that Commander Makabe's wish?

127
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:27,541
Or perhaps...

128
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:30,625
Is this what you
want, Miss Kariya?

129
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:34,208
It is a policy of
the Arcadian Project.

130
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,916
Doctor... You're aware that

131
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,750
we don't have much
time left, aren't you?

132
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:41,583
I am.

133
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:44,041
I understand
the situation fully.

134
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,083
But a girl in that condition...

135
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:48,125
The illness that she has...

136
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:50,041
...it's chronic, right?

137
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,333
How many people have
you already sacrificed

138
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:58,041
for the sake of this project?

139
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:02,791
Why do you care now?

140
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:10,833
Look!
She's awake!

141
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:14,375
Didn't I just tell you not
to overwork yourself, dear?

142
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:16,666
I'm so sorry.

143
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,041
Are you feeling okay now?

144
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:20,500
Yeah.

145
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:23,125
All right then, I still have
work to do at the hangar.

146
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:26,458
I think it'd be better if
you rested here tonight.

147
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:27,708
Yes.

148
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:30,875
Don't worry Shoko,
I'll stay right here with you.

149
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:32,250
You will?

150
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:34,458
And I'll stay here
with you guys too!

151
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,958
Thank you.

152
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:39,250
Then it's settled.

153
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:41,125
I'll go to Grandma Nishio's.

154
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:43,208
And bring back
something delicious.

155
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:44,666
Okay!

156
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,375
Well, then I'm
headed back to work.

157
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:49,833
I'll see you later.

158
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:53,333
Maya dear, would you please
take care of Shoko for me?

159
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:55,541
Of course I will.
Bye.

160
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:58,708
I'll see you later.
Thanks, Mom.

161
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,708
Maya.
Come here.

162
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:03,916
Huh?

163
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,833
I have a favor to ask you.

164
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:07,458
What is it?

165
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:18,750
Koyo already agreed
to help us out, but...

166
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:22,333
Shoko wants you to be a
part of it too, Kazuki.

167
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,291
What do you say?

168
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:27,666
Yeah, sure thing.

169
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:30,041
I'll be sure to go and visit
her in her room later.

170
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:34,166
If you could do that...
it would make me really happy.

171
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:49,208
It's your turn, Kazuki.

172
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:50,750
Now...

173
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:53,125
...which one of these
should I pick next...?

174
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:56,125
Who cares?
Just hurry up already.

175
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:36,500
Word of advice.

176
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:38,625
Don't get so close
to the others.

177
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:40,125
What do you mean?

178
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:46,250
Listen...

179
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:48,166
We can't stay as
friends anymore...

180
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,291
At least not right now.

181
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:58,166
Mom?

182
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:59,291
Yes?

183
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:02,625
Will I ever be
able to pilot a Fafner...

184
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:04,750
...like Kazuki?

185
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:09,083
You will some day,
after you're well.

186
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:12,875
Will the day ever come when
my body is completely well?

187
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,708
I wonder.

188
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:17,041
I'm positive that it will, dear.

189
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:20,500
After all, I'm healthy,
and you are my daughter.

190
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:22,250
Right!

191
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:28,375
The Nothung Model...

192
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:32,041
I want to see it ASAP
with my own eyes.

193
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:35,375
I must say,
it's truly a sight to behold.

194
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:42,208
Solomon has made a prophecy!

195
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:44,416
Where will it emerge this time?

196
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:02,291
Secretary General!
It's a Festom!

197
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:03,333
What?!

198
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:09,458
Are you there?

199
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,291
Solomon has responded.
But it's unclear!

200
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:18,666
It's definitely a Sphinx type!

201
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,541
Help me with the correspondence.

202
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:21,416
Sure thing.

203
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,166
You're supposed to say "Roger."

204
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:25,083
Roger.

205
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:26,500
Maya!

206
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:29,625
Just calm down, okay?
And you'll be fine.

207
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:31,000
All right.

208
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:33,833
He's right.
Calm down.

209
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:55,791
The ship!
It's sunk!

210
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:57,375
After all this...

211
00:14:57,458 --> 00:15:00,750
I... simply refuse to give up
the Nothung Model, understand?

212
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:03,250
Commander, the Neo U.N.
has sent out a rescue signal.

213
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:05,375
How would you
like us to proceed?

214
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:08,625
It would be a lot better
for us if they just sank.

215
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:12,208
However, we can't
ignore their call for help.

216
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:14,416
We'll have to send Mark Elf.

217
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,416
Yes, I understand, sir.

218
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:23,250
Hey, wait.
You haven't fully recovered yet.

219
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:25,041
I'm all right.

220
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:27,750
I... I'm sorry.

221
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:33,833
You don't understand.
I can't just lie here.

222
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:36,000
I have work that
I need to do too.

223
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:38,833
My job is to help Kazuki.

224
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:47,875
Okay then, Shoko...
is there anything I can do?

225
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:49,916
Anything at all?

226
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:53,416
Thank you Koyo.

227
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:58,000
Standby for Fafner
initiation phase.

228
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:01,750
Pilot move to the cockpit block.

229
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:08,250
Attention: We will be arriving
at the Fafner hangar soon.

230
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:11,625
All right, we're here.

231
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,416
Kazuki.

232
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,458
Shoko!

233
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:26,333
Are you...
preparing to go out again?

234
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:31,916
Please make sure that you
come back to the island safely.

235
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:34,458
And when you return...

236
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:37,375
I will be right here,
ready to assist you.

237
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:39,625
Make sure you come back, okay?

238
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:41,125
I will.

239
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:47,208
It's a promise then.

240
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:53,041
While you're gone...

241
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:54,916
...you don't need to
worry about this place...

242
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,291
I will protect it.

243
00:16:57,833 --> 00:16:59,333
All right.

244
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,583
Unfolding LDA.

245
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:04,583
Gewitters number
one and two locked.

246
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:06,958
Gewitters number
three and four locked.

247
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:08,541
Fafner cage out.

248
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:11,291
Transfering AVC Lindwurm
to the turntable.

249
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:13,041
Move the block.

250
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:19,916
Conducting final
safety checks...

251
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,458
We're greenlit to go!

252
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,458
Secure Fafner
to contact position.

253
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:25,791
Lock Contact Arm.

254
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,250
Well, you're getting
your rescue mission.

255
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:44,166
We are to rescue that
Neo U.N. convoy ship.

256
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:46,208
Does that mean
we're saving people?

257
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:08,958
Where are they?

258
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:12,000
Isn't the API1 rescue
mission here yet?

259
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,083
Are you there?

260
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:32,625
It's made contact.

261
00:18:32,708 --> 00:18:35,458
Lindwurm has just reached the
convoy ship rendevous point.

262
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:37,583
We must alert the
medical team right away.

263
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:40,250
Have them see to
all of the injured.

264
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:43,375
It can't be...

265
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:45,541
Solomon's having
another prophecy!

266
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:48,208
What is the location
of this new Festom?

267
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:51,375
Directly above us, sir,
holding at 10,000 meters!

268
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:55,041
Prepare to unfold the number
two Walle Shield immediately!

269
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:56,666
Attention all island residents.

270
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,333
Please take shelter at once.

271
00:18:58,416 --> 00:18:59,875
Repeat.

272
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:02,750
Attention all island residents.
Please take shelter at once.

273
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:10,833
There's interference in the
Walle Shield's wavelength.

274
00:19:12,041 --> 00:19:14,500
The wavelength is synchronized.

275
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,541
It's penetrated
the number one Shield.

276
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:18,875
Two seconds until the target

277
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:21,916
reaches the number
two Walle Shield.

278
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:28,583
The number two
Walle Shield isn't holding.

279
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:32,583
The target is going to crash
into Tatsumiya mountain.

280
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:35,791
We don't have time
to calculate its mass.

281
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:38,291
Everyone prepare for impact!

282
00:19:40,541 --> 00:19:43,250
The target has descended to
the main island's center bloc.

283
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:45,416
Give me a status
report on the damage.

284
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,375
How is the Festom?

285
00:19:46,458 --> 00:19:48,208
It seems to be a Sphinx type.

286
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:50,791
But we have no
data on this model.

287
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:26,583
Our orders have changed.

288
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:29,375
A new Festom has
appeared on Tatsumiya Island.

289
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:31,875
The enemy's at Tatsumiya Island?

290
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:56,708
Kazuki, get back here now!

291
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:57,791
Not a chance!

292
00:20:57,875 --> 00:20:59,583
You have to come back!

293
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:04,708
Initiate the number
three and five breakers.

294
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:07,166
Release the emergency
suspension valve!

295
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,166
Releasing emergency
suspension valve!

296
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:12,666
Currently Mark Elf
is moving to area 52.

297
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:17,000
How did this happen?
They invaded us so easily!

298
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:19,666
The data on the new Sphinx
type has been registered.

299
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:22,333
We're now tracking its
behavioral patterns.

300
00:21:42,416 --> 00:21:44,166
Please stop.

301
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:59,458
I beg you.
It's Kazuki's island too.

302
00:21:59,541 --> 00:22:01,416
Don't destroy it.

303
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,458
Even though there were promises
that were made, it was

304
00:22:16,541 --> 00:22:20,583
impossible to escape from this
unfortunate chain of events.

305
00:22:21,041 --> 00:22:24,708
Although this promise was
not made just to one person...

306
00:22:25,166 --> 00:22:27,250
It's just that this time,

307
00:22:27,333 --> 00:22:30,125
she was the only one
who knew about it.

308
