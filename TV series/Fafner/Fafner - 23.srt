Kazuki.

3
00:00:30,375 --> 00:00:33,791
Why? He was
such a nice boy.

4
00:00:33,875 --> 00:00:37,750
Sis...
She's crying...

5
00:00:37,833 --> 00:00:45,708
What happened?
Did we lose someone?

00:00:46,541 --> 00:00:51,500

Mamoru, please answer me.

This can't be!
Oh Mamoru...

11
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:02,833
We have less than
two weeks until the

12
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:05,333
final battle at the North Pole.

13
00:03:05,416 --> 00:03:07,041
This test is going
to be the last one

14
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:09,208
we will run at this base.

15
00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:11,708
I didn't expect you
to be able to handle

16
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:13,916
the Salvator Model
this well Yukie.

17
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,500
Nice work.

18
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:17,625
Thank you for
the compliment sir.

19
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:19,833
I have entrusted you
with my lifelong dream.

20
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:22,125
The human race's
fate is in your hands.

21
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:24,416
Yes sir I understand that.

22
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,625
You may begin now.

23
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:26,708
I'm sorry sir.

24
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:28,500
The pilot's
bio-graph is abnormal.

25
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:29,458
We should wait.

26
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:30,541
Of course it is.

27
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:32,208
After all, we've
administered her with

28
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:34,041
sub lethal doses of
the medicine...

29
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:36,125
We did it to accelerate
the affects the Festum

30
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:37,416
elements
would have on her.

31
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,791
Yes sir...
but still...

32
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:41,041
It was the only way for her
to operate this machine.

33
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:44,125
She knew full well
the consequences.

34
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:48,625
Her life may not last very long.
We don't have any time to waste.

35
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:52,958
I've earned the right to pilot.
It makes me so happy.

36
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:54,958
What's wrong?

37
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:57,333
Why is there a delay in
releasing the cage?

38
00:03:58,208 --> 00:03:59,208
We are finished.

39
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:00,666
I am the vessel
through which we have

40
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,541
come to understand this place.

41
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:03,958
What!

42
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:09,333
I am the one
through which we have

43
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:10,791
learned about your emotions.

44
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:13,333
And we will now take
your newfound power.

45
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:14,041
He's gone!

46
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:15,333
Terminate the test now!

47
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:17,750
I want a complete
shutdown of the Fafner core!

48
00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:21,708
What?

49
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:23,208
The Festum's doing it.

50
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:24,708
Disable all the
cockpit functions!

51
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:28,041
I have no control over it.
It's rejecting all the codes.

52
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:29,041
You bastard!

53
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:30,416
You're destroying
all of our work!

54
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,708
No. No.

55
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:33,666
No!

56
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:38,125
You are me now.
And we are one.

57
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:48,458
No... Wait!

58
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:50,375
You can't do this!

59
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:02,583
Oh Mitsuhiro...
Help.

60
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:11,750
This is hate...
I feel it now.

61
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:16,083
This is hate!

62
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:25,083
The machine I built myself
couldn't save my only son.

63
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:27,083
I can't do this anymore.

64
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:28,750
I'm sorry.

65
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,208
I think the boss is
calling it quits for good.

66
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:34,708
Don't be an idiot!

67
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:37,583
He just needs a little more
time to recover that's all.

68
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:39,166
You better not slack off.

69
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:41,291
You wouldn't want the Boss to
yell at you when he gets back.

70
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:42,833
All right!
We have three hours!

71
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:44,291
Let's finish changing
all those parts!

72
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:45,666
Yes sir!

73
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,541
Thank you so much.
I appreciate that.

74
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:48,791
Oh. Right.

75
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:51,041
You've managed to keep
everybody's spirits up.

76
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:53,541
It's thanks to you that
I don't feel depressed.

77
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:56,041
You think so.
I didn't do that much .

78
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:57,916
I'll follow his example.

79
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,333
Chisato...

80
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:01,750
What are you doing here?
You should still be resting...

81
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:03,625
There's much to be done here.

82
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:06,125
And besides, my grief can wait.

83
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:09,208
Twenty hours has passed
since communication was

84
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:11,791
cut off between us and
the Siegfried System.

85
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:13,083
We have no
way of knowing

86
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:14,541
what the conditions are inside.

87
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:16,291
But according to the report...

88
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:19,125
...we do have reason to believe
that he is still breathing.

89
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:22,416
That's only because they
have no use for the air.

90
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,541
Are they attempting
to assimilate

91
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:25,291
Soshi while he's alive...?

92
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:26,875
No.
It's not that.

93
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:28,541
They lost the core
mid assimilation,

94
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:31,291
when the main body was
severed from the roots.

95
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:34,291
So there's still a good chance
that Soshi wasn't harmed.

96
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:37,000
Prepare to carry out the rescue
operations that were designed by

97
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:38,916
Ms. Kondo within the next hour.

98
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,500
I just hope it
works, for all our sakes.

99
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:44,125
Ms. Kondo is an expert in the
field of Festum analysis,

100
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:47,125
and the person responsible
for the design of Solomon.

101
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:49,666
We have no options
other than her plan.

102
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,666
The problem though
is Kazuki's body.

103
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,500
Are you really going
to let him do it?

104
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:57,250
He has agreed to it.
And Kazuki wants this.

105
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:00,500
Kenji, open up.

106
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:02,875
Come on, the four of us
are the only ones remaining

107
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:04,166
who can still fight now.

108
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:05,541
You must fight.

109
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:08,625
If for no other reason,
do it for Mamoru and Sakura?

110
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,958
I don't want to die...

111
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:13,791
I don't want to die!

112
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:14,875
Hey Kenji...

113
00:07:14,958 --> 00:07:17,000
...haven't you
forgotten something...

114
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:20,208
Our fight we
haven't settled it yet.

115
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:25,583
Kenji...
I want to let you know...

116
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:28,791
...I'm actually feeling
somewhat relieved right now

117
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:31,625
because the truth is you
probably won't have to fight

118
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:34,375
if you stay locked
in there like that.

119
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,041
However...

120
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:39,666
...keep in mind that
it means somebody else

121
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,791
will have to pilot
a Fafner in your place...

122
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:45,250
Try not to forget that okay.

123
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:49,125
And if you still
don't want to fight...

124
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:51,166
It's alright son.

125
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:54,125
Mom will make
sure to protect you.

126
00:07:57,583 --> 00:07:59,416
I can't bring myself to...

127
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:01,208
I can't do it.

128
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:02,291
Yumiko.

129
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:04,500
Megaselion is
damaged beyond repair.

130
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:06,666
And I can't pilot one of
the Nothung Models

131
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:07,958
in my current state.

132
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:10,041
But you've piloted a
Fafner and fought bravely

133
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:11,750
up through the
maximum age limit.

134
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:13,625
Nobody is going
to give you any grief

135
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:16,541
if you decide to
retire now, Michio.

136
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:19,000
They need me.
I can't retire.

137
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:22,041
At least not until the
new pilots are ready.

138
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:23,458
Cause if I retire now,

139
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:26,750
I won't be able to justify
all the lives I've taken.

140
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:29,625
Listen, when the
medicine's effect expires...

141
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:31,458
...we'll get married.

142
00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:33,916
Michio...

143
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,458
May I have your permission?

144
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:37,875
Yes. May you
be happy together.

145
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:39,458
I wish you both the best.

146
00:08:39,541 --> 00:08:41,708
Thank you, I'm so honored.

147
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:43,208
Now.

148
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:45,291
Please, let's do this.

149
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:51,375
Promise me...

150
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:53,833
...you won't die.

151
00:08:58,041 --> 00:09:01,000
I'm next.
Give me the injection.

152
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:04,541
So...
how did it go?

153
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:06,791
Not good.

154
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:08,875
Looks like we're going to
have to fight without him.

155
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:10,250
Oh, I see...

156
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:12,250
Well...
I guess I'll be going now.

157
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:13,750
I'll go with you.

158
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:15,250
Maya, you should stay here.

159
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:16,208
Huh?

160
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:18,875
You should wait...
for Kazuki.

161
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:23,458
Once it enters your blood
stream, the medicine will

162
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:26,875
activate and promote
unification with your Fafner.

163
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:30,083
And my eye...
can it heal it?

164
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:32,083
Yes, but temporarily.

165
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:35,166
However after the medicine
wears off, you may go through

166
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,833
an unusually strong
assimilation process.

167
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:40,000
I'm prepared.

168
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:41,125
Please do it.

169
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:44,208
Do it while I can
still save Soshi...

170
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:45,666
I was wondering
something Canon...

171
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:48,083
...were you trying to be
nice to Maya back there?

172
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:50,208
I wasn't trying anything.

173
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:51,458
It's just...

174
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:52,708
I wanted to leave.

175
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:55,166
'Cuz I never have
anything to say to Kazuki.

176
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:57,083
Nothing important.

177
00:09:58,916 --> 00:10:00,750
That's not really true.

178
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:05,000
Hey... Kazuki...

179
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:06,708
Do you remember...?

180
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:08,666
...that time when
we played cards at Alvis?

181
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:12,083
Shoko and Koyo were
there with us too that night.

182
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:13,625
Yeah...

183
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:16,458
And I, remember that you were
the one who came and got me.

184
00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:18,750
When I think about the things
that happened back then...

185
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:20,500
...I feel like I
can understand why

186
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:23,458
mom and the others were hiding
the island's secret from us.

187
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:25,875
It was for our own good.

188
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:28,708
To teach us...
all about peace.

189
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:30,208
You know what I also think?

190
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:33,583
I think they didn't want to
rob us of those memories.

191
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:35,083
What do you mean?

192
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:37,750
You become afraid of good
memories cuz you know

193
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:40,083
how easily they can be
taken away from you.

194
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:43,041
However without those good
memories to hold onto,

195
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:46,458
all you end up left with
are the horrors of battle.

196
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:48,041
I think that's why
you push yourself

197
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:50,500
so hard to keep
fighting, Kazuki.

198
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:53,125
You know...

199
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:55,291
I won't forget what you were
like before you were a pilot ...

200
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:57,708
I could never forget that.

201
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:00,375
That's why I refuse
to forget about

202
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:02,083
what things were like before.

203
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:04,125
When things were fine.

204
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:07,750
Try to remember those
times, okay Kazuki?

205
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:10,375
You know, Maya.
You're pretty remarkable.

206
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:13,791
You take such good care
of people's memories...

207
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:16,125
That's why...

208
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:19,791
...whenever I'm with you...
I always feel so relieved.

209
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:23,375
You really feel that way?

210
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,541
You attempted to do
the same thing against

211
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:29,583
Kazuki Makabe that
the Festum does.

212
00:11:30,416 --> 00:11:33,583
That is a betrayal
against the human race.

213
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:36,166
That wound is the punishment.

214
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:37,625
Justice was served.

215
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:40,333
You got what you deserved
for your deplorable actions.

216
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:41,791
You're wrong...

217
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:43,583
You're mistaken.
This wound...

218
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:45,125
...made me who I am.

219
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:48,041
Imagine how you'd feel if you
could stop being yourself.

220
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:49,875
How relieved you would be.

221
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:53,625
I don't think like that.
At least not anymore.

222
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:55,500
But I know the actual truth.

223
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:58,333
You're jealous of the
Festum aren't you?!

224
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:05,250
You Festum are capable
of many things now...

225
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:07,083
I see you know how
to read my mind...

226
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:09,708
Is that how you try to lure me?

227
00:12:09,791 --> 00:12:11,750
Just because you've learned
to understand people's pain,

228
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:13,958
you think you
understand everything?

229
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:15,375
And what about you?

230
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:18,041
Do you even know what
it's like to feel pain yourself?

231
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:20,125
After everything you've done...

232
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:22,500
I'm here...
I'm still here.

233
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:25,208
Kazuki!

234
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:37,333
Tsubaki Minashiro has
responded from the Keel Block.

235
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:39,333
Begin releasing each barrier.

236
00:12:39,416 --> 00:12:40,708
Kazuki.

237
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:42,833
Follow the orders I give you
and mobilize Mark Sein.

238
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:44,416
Roger.

239
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,708
After five minutes, bring up the
image on each of the monitors.

240
00:12:46,791 --> 00:12:48,083
Yes, sir.

241
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:50,083
Disclosing that information
is a double-edged sword

242
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:52,708
If by any chance Soshi
isn't all right in there...

243
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:55,833
If we keep things from them
we'll lose the people's trust.

244
00:12:55,916 --> 00:12:58,666
And as of now trust is
the only power we have.

245
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:01,833
Mark Sein has completely
submerged under water.

246
00:13:01,916 --> 00:13:04,916
Alvis will release
the lower barrier.

247
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:10,750
We are closing off the Norn
hangar and number seven circuit

248
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:12,208
located near the Keel Block.

249
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,541
We will fill the decompression
chamber with seawater

250
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:17,875
and create a path
for the Mark Sein.

251
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:30,875
Is that water?

252
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:32,750
That's Urd's Well...

253
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:34,541
It's a type of liquid
computer that was

254
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:37,333
once used to analyze the MIR.

255
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:39,833
Its Solomon's master
server now and it tells us

256
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:41,833
when the enemies
are approaching.

257
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:44,500
If that's a computer,
is it okay to step on it?

258
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:47,291
Yes. You can
swim through it too.

259
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:50,583
Welcome...

260
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:52,916
...to where the island's
future will be determined.

261
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,750
I summoned you here to the
coagula one time before.

262
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:57,166
Do you remember that?

263
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,666
Yeah.

264
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:01,083
That was when you told me that
I should fight with Soshi.

265
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:03,250
At least that's what I sensed.

266
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:04,666
Yes, that's right, Kazuki.

267
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:07,041
And I thank you
for listening to me.

268
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:10,000
Where is he?
Is he okay?

269
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:12,916
He's right there. Inside.

270
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:14,875
Listen carefully, Kazuki.

271
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:18,083
That Festum that you're looking
at no longer possesses a core.

272
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:20,083
We've asked Tsubaki
to become its core.

273
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:22,458
Then she will lead the
Festum to self-destruction

274
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:25,208
with use of your Mark Sein.

275
00:14:25,291 --> 00:14:26,708
In order to do this,

276
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:29,541
Tsubaki is going to have to
integrate with your Fafner.

277
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:32,000
Do not fight her existence.

278
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:33,333
Got it.

279
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:46,291
The integration was instant...
Just as I expected.

280
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:47,833
Are both of you
all right in there?

281
00:14:47,916 --> 00:14:49,916
Now assimilate only
with the surface units

282
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,458
and approach the
opponent cautiously.

283
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:54,083
If you try to tear them off,

284
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:56,875
you will run the risk of
putting Soshi in danger.

285
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:58,666
Okay, got it.

286
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:00,791
Soshi...

287
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,250
Now I am you...
do you see?

288
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:21,458
And you are...
you are me...

289
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:42,791
Kazuki...
is that you?

290
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:43,958
Soshi!

291
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:46,125
Soshi, it's me.

292
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:48,458
Communication with the
system has been recovered.

293
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:50,208
So then he's okay.

294
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:54,041
Projecting an image from
the Siegfried's interior!

295
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:57,083
He's still alive!
Thank goodness!

296
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:58,500
Kazuki...

297
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:01,958
How many hours has it been...
since the last battle?

298
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:03,583
Twenty-one hours.

299
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:05,083
It's been that long?

300
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:08,833
My sense of time is dulling.
So I can't really tell.

301
00:16:08,916 --> 00:16:10,958
Soshi, are you hurt at all?

302
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:12,458
I don't know...

303
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:14,291
The sense of
pain that I'm feeling...

304
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:16,875
...seems to be fading away.

305
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:19,333
Kazuki...
Are you really there?

306
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:21,583
Yeah I'm here!
I'm right here with you Soshi!

307
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:23,416
I'll get you out of there soon.

308
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,375
Kazuki.
Don't be too eager!

309
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:27,833
Leave it to Tsubaki's will.

310
00:16:29,041 --> 00:16:30,750
Alright...

311
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:40,041
Sollomon is responding!

312
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:41,875
Move to Vaffe Larden!

313
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:45,708
Babalon, Mark Sieben,
Mark Eins, stand by to take off.

314
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:47,166
On my way.

315
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:50,166
I'll teach them that this
battle is far from over yet.

316
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:05,291
Good, I can do this.
I can still fight.

317
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:09,000
Canon and I will distract
the enemy in the front.

318
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:12,083
Maya, you get back and try to
prevent the enemy from landing.

319
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:13,500
You got it!

320
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:16,000
During battle, we can only
communicate with the CDC.

321
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:17,750
Good luck everyone!

322
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:19,958
The object is on approach
from a heading of 10 o'clock.

323
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:22,125
It's speed is...
M-Mach seven!

324
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,458
That's some amazing speed.

325
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:25,250
Was it assimilated by the enemy?

326
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:26,791
We identified it.

327
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:29,625
According to its I.D. code,
it's a Neo U.N. patrol plane.

328
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:31,541
What about Denial?
Do we have time for it?

329
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:32,750
There's no time.

330
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:35,333
Its about to hit the
number one Welle Shield.

331
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:41,791
It's broken through
both the number one

332
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:43,458
and number two Welle Shields.

333
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:45,166
It's going to
crash on the coast.

334
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:46,583
Here it comes!

335
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:55,541
Wait, that's the...

336
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:57,333
...Salvator Model!

337
00:17:57,416 --> 00:18:00,000
So the enemy
got its hands on it...

338
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:02,833
What's that?

339
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:04,708
What's it doing?

340
00:18:09,583 --> 00:18:11,208
What just...?

341
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:14,083
Is this...?

342
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:16,125
...an integration?

343
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:19,375
It's the machine code...

344
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:21,666
Mark... Nicht...

345
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,666
Is Festum trying
to integrate with it?

346
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:26,000
It's attempting to uproot all
the power we've gained!

347
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:27,708
Attention all pilots,
intercept it!

348
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:29,458
Take this, you bastard!

349
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:39,250
Canon!

350
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:50,583
Take this!

351
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:55,583
No Canon!
Retreat!

352
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:57,791
There's not enough time!

353
00:18:58,916 --> 00:19:01,125
Canon! Michio!

354
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:18,916
The Festum is growing rapidly.

355
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,375
It's penetrating the entire
island from the Keel Block on.

356
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:22,833
All pilots standby!

357
00:19:22,916 --> 00:19:25,000
I want all the Fafners
released from the hangers!

358
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:27,250
We can't let the
enemy have them!

359
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:53,666
No!

360
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:55,541
The Festum's roots have
penetrated the Main Bloc.

361
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:56,791
What?

362
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:58,791
Take cover!

363
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:03,625
Kazuki, block the enemy's power!
It's taking over the system!

364
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:04,916
Hurry!

365
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:18,041
Ayano!

366
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:19,291
There's nothing you can do!

367
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:21,250
Evacuate island residents
to the southeast.

368
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:23,916
Prepare to disengage N bloc.

369
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,416
Mrs. Kodate!

370
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:31,875
Mrs. Kodate!

371
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:33,916
No!

372
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,416
Ms. Hazama!

373
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:38,291
Look out!

374
00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:42,166
Please stop this...

375
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:43,333
You're wrong...

376
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:46,083
Humans are not
only filled with hatred...

377
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:49,583
Please!
Try to understand!

378
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,833
Damn!

379
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
CDC, do you read me?
Separate the block right now!

380
00:20:58,083 --> 00:21:00,916
Disengage the N bloc.
Do it now!

381
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:12,625
Damn you.
I won't let you escape me...

382
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:34,041
Hold on... where do
you think you're going?

383
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:36,708
I won't let you...

384
00:21:36,791 --> 00:21:37,916
My Yumiko...

385
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,458
...is over there...

386

Initiating Fenrir...

387
00:21:41,916 --> 00:21:44,000
I promised her
I'd return alive...

388
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:45,541
And I keep my word.

389
00:21:45,625 --> 00:21:48,000
Ejecting cockpit bloc...

390
00:21:53,208 --> 00:21:55,375
Activating Fenrir.
