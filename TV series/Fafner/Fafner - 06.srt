1
00:00:14,125 --> 00:00:15,333
Solomon's having
another prophecy!

2
00:00:15,416 --> 00:00:17,291
What is the location
of this new Festom?

3
00:00:17,375 --> 00:00:20,125
Directly above us, sir,
holding at 10,000 meters.

4
00:00:20,208 --> 00:00:23,333
Attention all island residents.
Please take shelter at once.

5
00:00:23,416 --> 00:00:25,791
There's interference in the
Walle Shield's wavelength.

6
00:00:25,875 --> 00:00:28,083
The wavelength is synchronized.

7
00:00:38,458 --> 00:00:40,500
The enemy's at Tatsumiya Island?

8
00:00:40,583 --> 00:00:42,458
Kazuki, get back here now!

9
00:00:42,541 --> 00:00:44,791
It's penetrated the
number one Walle Shield.

10
00:00:44,875 --> 00:00:46,291
Two seconds until the target

11
00:00:46,375 --> 00:00:48,833
reaches the number
two Walle Shield.

12
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:56,500
The number two
Walle Shield isn't holding.

13
00:00:56,875 --> 00:00:59,125
The target is going to crash
into Tatsumiya mountain.

14
00:00:59,208 --> 00:01:01,333
We don't have time
to calculate its mass.

15
00:01:01,416 --> 00:01:02,958
Everyone prepare for impact!

16
00:01:05,541 --> 00:01:08,125
The data on the new Sphinx
type has been registered.

17
00:01:08,208 --> 00:01:11,041
We're now tracking its
behavioral patterns.

18
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:28,041
♪ opening song ♪

19
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,250
Give me the status
of the Mark Elf!

20
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:13,375
From what I can tell, it appears
to be defending the convoy.

21
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:15,791
He can't get back
here right now.

22
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:36,958
Damage has spread to
the ground level of bloc 45.

23
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:38,541
Strengthen all of our defenses!

24
00:03:38,625 --> 00:03:40,916
We need to
restrict its movement.

25
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:03,833
Sir!

26
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:06,583
The enemy has reached
Alvis' outer armor.

27
00:04:11,916 --> 00:04:15,333
The B1 sector of bloc 45...
has been hit!

28
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:18,583
This is bad.

29
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:22,000
The enemy's begun to attack
the sectors directly below us.

30
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:25,500
It must be attempting to
reach Valkyrie's Coagula!

31
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:40,625
The protective wall
around Valkyrie's Coagula

32
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:43,500
appears to have
activated automatically.

33
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:49,208
What should I do?

34
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:03,000
Four more of our Norns
have been shot down!

35
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:06,208
We can't stop the
Sphinx from advancing.

36
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:17,750
A fire has broken out
in sector D-9 of bloc 18!

37
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:19,041
While you're gone...

38
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:21,208
...you don't need to
worry about this place...

39
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:23,250
I will protect it.

40
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:25,791
All right.

41
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:46,625
Kazuki.

42
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:52,625
Make sure you come back, okay?

43
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:56,625
It's a promise then.

44
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:04,750
Partitions B 3 through
25 have been closed.

45
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:06,791
The Norns are preparing
to launch a wave attack.

46
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:08,791
Valkyrie's Coagula
has been destroyed

47
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:10,958
in bloc 9 directly above us.

48
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:13,041
No response from
automated interception

49
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:15,791
--system numbers 18, 24, and 26.
--Shoko.

50
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,458
The Sphinx has
received a direct hit!

51
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:19,166
But it hasn't disappeared yet.

52
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,541
Shoko!

53
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:22,708
Oh, Mom...

54
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:25,875
Why do you have
that synergetic suit on?

55
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:31,500
What exactly do
you think you're doing?

56
00:06:32,166 --> 00:06:33,541
Answer me, Shoko!

57
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:36,791
Let me go!
I have to help Kazuki.

58
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,291
You're being ridiculous!

59
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:40,833
What's wrong
with what I'm doing?

60
00:06:40,916 --> 00:06:42,500
I want to protect
this island too!

61
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:44,125
I won't let you
risk your life just

62
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:45,750
because you think
you can help this island!

63
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:48,125
It's not for the island!

64
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:51,000
I'm doing this for Kazuki!

65
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:56,833
Kazuki!
Try using the Lacing Cutter!

66
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:06,708
I did it!

67
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:18,833
Shoko.
Your body is very weak!

68
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:21,833
You shouldn't be here
in the first place!

69
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:23,666
But this is our destiny.

70
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,333
Since the day we were born...

71
00:07:25,416 --> 00:07:28,458
...you always knew that
we were destined to fight.

72
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:33,833
And now I want to do it...
of my own free will.

73
00:07:36,541 --> 00:07:40,500
So please...
Aren't we allowed that much?

74
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:43,750
After all...

75
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:47,500
I'm not even your real child.

76
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,708
From today on this
baby will be your child.

77
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:54,083
Thank you so much.

78
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:07,541
Please try to understand.
I promised Kazuki.

79
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,166
And I just...

80
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:12,291
...really need to
keep that promise.

81
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:10,375
Kazuki felt this
kind of pain too...

82
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:12,958
This same pain.

83
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:19,125
Why is it starting up?

84
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:20,958
Hey Yoko!

85
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:23,708
Who's piloting the Mark Zex?

86
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:25,625
Yoko!

87
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:29,500
What's this?
Are we deploying the Mark Zex?

88
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:31,958
Soshi Please,
you've got to help me.

89
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:33,916
Stop Shoko.

90
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:37,708
Please Soshi!

91
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:40,333
Shoko, no!

92
00:09:40,416 --> 00:09:43,500
Our duty is to
protect the island.

93
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:49,416
Besides, the most appropriate
pilot for the Mark Zex is Shoko.

94
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,250
But you already
know all of this.

95
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:53,500
Don't you, Ms. Hazama?

96
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:55,458
But she's my...

97
00:09:57,791 --> 00:10:00,125
Shoko, you're clear
for take--off.

98
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:04,041
Thank you, Soshi
for helping me with this.

99
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:23,666
The Mark Zex?

100
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:26,458
Who is piloting it?

101
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,833
It can't be...

102
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:35,375
Is it true?

103
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:37,500
Is it really Shoko?

104
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:52,958
Look Tamotsu!

105
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:55,416
There must be a problem
with her power balance.

106
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:58,333
I need for her to
return the Mark Zex.

107
00:10:58,416 --> 00:11:01,208
That way I can
readjust the lift engine!

108
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:04,083
You there?
Fumihiko!

109
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:06,083
That won't be necessary.

110
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,291
You should
just stay out of this.

111
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:12,041
Hey! Just who do
you think you are?

112
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:28,000
The interior damage to Alvis has
spread through B-4 block 86!

113
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:31,458
The Mark Zex is approaching
the target from above.

114
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,125
Shoko!

115
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:49,833
Are you there?

116
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:54,625
Are you there?

117
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:45,958
How about...

118
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:48,375
...this!

119
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:07,666
I did it!

120
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,375
Kazuki!
Come back immediately!

121
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:11,458
Alvis is in danger!

122
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,666
It's amazing.

123
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:24,625
So then this is the true
power of API1's Fafner?

124
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:52,000
Get off the island!
Go away!

125
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:54,125
This is Kazuki's island!

126
00:13:57,333 --> 00:13:58,416
Listen to me.

127
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,833
There's no way
the Mine Blade will work.

128
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:27,166
Her brainwaves
have been affected.

129
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,625
Shoko!

130
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:31,583
So even the Mark Zex
is not good enough...

131
00:14:57,458 --> 00:14:58,500
Give it up!
Shoko!

132
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:00,333
It's not working!

133
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:37,375
What do you think you're doing?

134
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:41,250
I am trying to...
draw it away from the island.

135
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,791
Okay.

136
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:58,416
Then I'll have the Norns
launch an attack from above.

137
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:16,416
Alright that's enough.
You can release the Sphinx.

138
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:20,208
Shoko.
What's the matter?

139
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:21,708
It won't let me go...

140
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:23,041
What?

141
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,791
You need to eject!
Now Shoko!

142
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:40,500
It's okay Soshi...

143
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:44,291
I am going to
try and use Fenrir.

144
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:47,750
Code confirmed.
Initiating Fenrir.

145
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:53,333
No, Shoko...

146
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:57,541
Kazuki...

147
00:16:58,458 --> 00:17:03,208
Don't worry.
I will protect your island...

148
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,083
Why Shoko?
Why'd you do this?

149
00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:15,333
Kazuki!

150
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:19,416
Soshi!

151
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,250
Just what on earth
is going on right now?

152
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:24,375
What you're doing is ridiculous!
Shoko!

153
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:39,625
Please Soshi.

154
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:42,791
You have to give
Shoko back to me.

155
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:46,333
--Koyo!
--Koyo!

156
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:49,500
Pilot candidates are on standby!

157
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:52,250
You may not leave your
posts without permission!

158
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:56,375
Hey!
Come back!

159
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:57,875
Shoko!

160
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:00,375
Maya!

161
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:15,458
Shoko.

162
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:47,125
Fenrir's release levels
set for maximum.

163
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:51,750
Shoko...

164
00:18:57,291 --> 00:19:01,583
Shoko!

165
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:07,291
Shoko...

166
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:16,291
Mama...

167
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:18,291
Mama...

168
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:20,291
That's right.
Mama.

169
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:21,750
I'm your mama.

170
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:23,791
Mamma.

171
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:26,791
Here.

172
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:29,458
Wow!

173
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:35,541
Mom.
I was wondering...

174
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:37,166
...why is my name Shoko?

175
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:38,916
Your name
means "to soar"

176
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,541
and one day you'll
soar high in the sky.

177
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:43,083
What do you mean?

178
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:45,875
I mean that one
day you'll really fly.

179
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:49,125
I'm going to soar
high up in the sky, right?

180
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:53,458
That's right.

181
00:19:57,375 --> 00:19:59,125
After all...

182
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:02,166
I'm not even your real child.

183
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,750
Forgive me.
I shouldn't have said that.

184
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,583
Sorry Mom.

185
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:16,500
Did I do it?

186
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:21,458
Was I able to...
keep my promise?

187
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:23,666
Kazuki...

188
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:57,375
What...
just happened?

189
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:03,333
The Mark Zex...
it's vanished with the Festom.

190
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:05,791
There's no sign of it anywhere.

191
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:34,125
It can't be.
It's not Shoko.

192
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:36,291
It's a lie.

193
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,750
The enemy has disappeared.

194
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,875
Unfortunately the
valuable Mark Zex...

195
00:21:43,958 --> 00:21:45,958
...is also gone.

196
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,291
No, it can't be!

197
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,916
Even though the
sky was clear that

198
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,083
day the rain seemed to fall.

199
00:22:03,916 --> 00:22:05,333
However...

200
00:22:05,416 --> 00:22:09,625
...memories of her gentle smile
seemed to sooth our pain.

201
00:22:09,708 --> 00:22:14,625
She seemed to be telling us,
"Don't cry," up from the sky.

A girl who
disappeared in the sky.

204
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:41,166
A boy who was
in a hurry to fight.

205
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:45,125
In the end, the ones who
got angry were the adults.

206
00:23:45,208 --> 00:23:49,291
And the ones who shed
tears, were also the adults.

207
00:23:49,375 --> 00:23:51,041
Yet the children
were the ones who

208
00:23:51,125 --> 00:23:54,000
were drenched in
the rain of despair.

Are you there?
