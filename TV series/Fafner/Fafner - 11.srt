1
00:00:18,833 --> 00:00:22,958
Hey, Maya, what about me?
Will you remember what I'm like?

2
00:00:23,041 --> 00:00:24,125
Kazuki...

3
00:00:24,208 --> 00:00:26,083
I'm just worried that over time

4
00:00:26,166 --> 00:00:27,791
I might get too
used to fighting.

5
00:00:27,875 --> 00:00:29,291
And it scares me.

6
00:00:29,958 --> 00:00:32,208
'Cuz you see...
I feel like I'm already

7
00:00:32,291 --> 00:00:35,541
gradually changing into
something different.

8
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:41,416
I think that...
everyone's been feeling uneasy.

9
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,625
And nothing's been
the same since.

10
00:00:43,708 --> 00:00:47,125
I don't think any of us will
remain unchanged.

11
00:00:47,208 --> 00:00:52,166
After all, we all have to go on
living on this island don't we?

12
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:56,458
So you see...
it's okay.

13
00:00:58,208 --> 00:00:59,833
Oh, Maya...

14
00:00:59,916 --> 00:01:01,041
Don't worry...

15
00:01:01,125 --> 00:01:04,500
...it doesn't matter if
you change; Kazuki,

16
00:01:04,583 --> 00:01:08,375
I will always remember you.
I promise I will.

17
00:01:09,916 --> 00:01:12,291
Thank you, Maya.

18
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:20,708
♪ opening song ♪

19
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:00,958
You came.

20
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:06,583
It's not too late.

21
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:09,375
You can still change your
mind and quit, you know.

22
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:15,291
No. I've already
made my decision about it.

23
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,416
Let's go then...
Let's leave this island.

24
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:33,458
Is this...
the right choice?

25
00:03:33,541 --> 00:03:35,333
I wonder.

26
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,125
I haven't seen Kazuki
around anywhere.

27
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:48,541
I wonder if he's stuck over at
Alvis, working or something?

28
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:51,208
You haven't heard?

29
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:52,958
Well I don't know if it's true,

30
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:54,625
but there's a rumor
going around that...

31
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:56,583
Kazuki and Miss Kariya...

32
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:57,125
...well...

33
00:03:57,208 --> 00:03:57,666
...were...

34
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,000
...you know...

35
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:01,083
You're kidding!

36
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:04,583
I didn't know they had
that kind of relationship!

37
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:07,791
Forbidden love! And with
such a large age difference.

38
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:11,083
Now they've run
off too... elope!

39
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:12,625
I can't believe it!
That's awesome!

40
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:13,916
Shut up!

41
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:17,583
I don't find it a bit amusing.

42
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:20,666
All that really happened was
that he got scared and ran away.

43
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:23,083
He's a deserter in my book.

44
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:27,375
What do they do to you if you
desert in the face of the enemy?

45
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:31,458
I don't know...

46
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:45,125
You've done
such a foolish thing...

47
00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:46,250
Yukie...

48
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:06,125
Where are we?
What exactly is this place?

49
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:09,125
It's a place where a few
billion humans used to live.

50
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:11,708
This was one of their cities.

51
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:16,583
Soshi...

52
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:20,708
He was here and saw
this world too, didn't he?

53
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:23,000
Yes.
That's what I've heard.

54
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:24,708
Now prepare for landing.

55
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:26,250
Got it.

56
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:53,125
Where have you gone to?

57
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:01,458
You're a good pilot.

58
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:03,750
That supposed to
be a compliment?

59
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:06,166
No. I didn't mean
anything by it...

60
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:06,958
I-I was just...

61
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:08,291
Believe it or not,

62
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:11,291
I was a Fafner pilot
candidate a long time ago.

63
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:12,916
Really? You were?

64
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:20,125
I verified the stats on the Mark
Elf pilot and there were no

65
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:21,916
abnormalities in the
synergetic code

66
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,500
formation rate or his
state of mind...

67
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:27,333
...except for the motive...

68
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:28,958
After careful evaluation,

69
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:31,166
I realized the only
possible conclusion

70
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:34,333
is that there must have been
some external factors involved.

71
00:06:34,416 --> 00:06:37,916
More specifically one external
factor called Yukie Kariya.

72
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:42,291
I'm sorry.

73
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:45,583
Can you leave Kazuki Makabe
and Yukie Kariya to me?

74
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:48,666
I'd personally like to determine
what to do with them.

75
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:52,625
Kozo Minashiro and I've been
aware for some time now

76
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:56,083
of the fact that Yukie
Kariya is a Neo U.N. spy.

77
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:58,750
We decided not to apprehend
her until we could discover

78
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:01,625
her true intentions,
so I take full responsibility

79
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:04,833
for not being able to prevent
the current situation.

80
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:10,333
Leave it to me.

81
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:24,791
You let yourself
be double-crossed

82
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:26,333
by a younger woman.

83
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:28,875
You better watch out--people
gonna start calling you easy.

84
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:33,541
Well and your
son siding with her.

85
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:36,583
I'm sure you
didn't expect that either.

86
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,333
Do you think Mitsuhiro
was involved with this?

87
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:45,250
Who else would have come up
with such a complicated scheme?

88
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:50,625
If that's true, then we haven't
seen the worst of all this yet.

89
00:07:50,708 --> 00:07:51,958
Yeah.

90
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:54,333
And knowing the way you are...

91
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:56,916
You're prepared
for that, aren't ya?

92
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:08,875
By any chance...

93
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:11,416
...are you regretting
what you've done?

94
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,833
No I'm not.

95
00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:14,916
Because I felt like if I
stayed that way any longer,

96
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,416
I was going to lose myself...

97
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,083
...for sure.

98
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:21,083
I agree.
You didn't belong.

99
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:23,708
That island wasn't
the place for you.

100
00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:26,375
You shouldn't just be
protecting that small island.

101
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:29,083
You ought to be protecting
the entire world.

102
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:32,416
Protect the world?
You mean me?

103
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:36,625
It's only natural for a
Fafner pilot of your caliber.

104
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:40,666
If we can use this
and destroy Festum,

105
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:43,458
I don't care what kind
of price I have to pay.

106
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:48,166
He used to always say to us...

107
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:49,875
...that we needed to
know the true meaning

108
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:52,208
of why Fafner was
originally created...

109
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:54,875
Make the people on the
island understand, Kazuki!

110
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:56,541
You can do it!

111
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,666
Miss Kariya...

112
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:06,000
...who is the "he"
you're referring to?

113
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,333
What?

114
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,166
This is bad timing!

115
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,875
It'll find us if we stay here.
We need to hurry up and leave!

116
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:21,625
No, that's out of the question.
We can't leave here yet!

117
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:22,708
Huh?

118
00:09:22,791 --> 00:09:25,625
Get ready to fight, Kazuki!

119
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:28,666
That is a direct order!

120
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:51,208
Are you there?

121
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,416
It didn't work!

122
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:29,125
What do you think you're doing!
Destroy it now, Kazuki!

123
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:30,583
I'm trying!

124
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:45,125
Kazuki.
Land and then stand by.

125
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:46,541
Got it.

126
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:50,250
Could it be?
Is that Fafner?

127
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:16,083
That Sphinx type seems
to be a little too easy.

128
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:18,208
So this should be a real breeze.

129
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:20,041
Triple Six, have you
confirmed whether

130
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:22,250
or not the target has
been assimilated?

131
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:24,250
How the hell am I
supposed to know that?

132
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:27,041
Kanon!
This one's mine, you understand?

133
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:29,416
Don't you dare try to interfere!

134
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,666
I couldn't anyway.
I have my orders.

135
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:42,500
I'm coming to secure
the Nothung model.

136
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:45,833
Are you there?

137
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,666
I'm so sick of that.

138
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:57,458
Oh, just you wait.

139
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:04,291
Oh well...
Too bad.

140
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:06,750
You got here right in time.

141
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:11,166
Are you there?

142
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:15,416
I was before.
However, I'm afraid I'm not now.

143
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:18,875
You know what they say, a beast
with ten horns hates all women.

144
00:12:19,416 --> 00:12:21,083
It will strip her naked...

145
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:23,291
...eat her flesh...

146
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:28,916
Then it'll...

147
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:31,875
...burn her down.

148
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,833
Sorry about that.

149
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:44,166
Awesome.

150
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:48,250
Miss Kariya...
What kind of Fafner is that?

151
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:50,958
Miss Kariya?

152
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:52,666
What's the matter?

153
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:05,416
Wait a sec...
it's an enemy?

154
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,875
Whoever that pilot is,
he sure is quick to move.

155
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:25,708
Oh no!

156
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:30,750
Who are you anyway?!

157
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:33,125
Well?
Answer me or I'll...

158
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:53,791
Now then...
Don't give me any trouble.

159
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,750
Kanon, I told you to
keep your nose out of this.

160
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:03,166
You're putting a damper on
things by ruining all my fun.

161
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:04,500
My duty comes first;

162
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:07,791
the order to have fun is
only secondary to that.

163
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:09,458
Tch!

164
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:12,750
Well, I can see that you're
as stubborn as usual.

165
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:44,458
Move it!

166
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:46,250
Get onto the boat.

167
00:14:58,333 --> 00:15:01,333
I never dreamed that
Kazuki was the pilot.

168
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:04,375
Listen. Kanon.
As your superior...

169
00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:07,625
Next time think of your duty
only after I've had my fun.

170
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:08,833
And that's an order!

171
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:11,666
I'm sorry.
That's not part of the rules.

172
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:12,666
Heh!

173
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,916
You sure are
one inflexible girl.

174
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:22,250
You're late.
I was waiting.

175
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:24,208
It's hard to get motivated
when you don't know

176
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:26,500
if there's gonna be a payoff.

177
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:28,166
Don't you agree?

178
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:29,875
My old friend.

179
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,833
Hey!
Aren't you Michio?

180
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:38,583
Oh now that hurts.

181
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:41,166
You mean you
didn't recognize me?

182
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,500
It really is quite a pity...

183
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:52,583
...for the Nothung model to
have ended up like this.

184
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:05,916
You tricked me, didn't you?!

185
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,708
This whole time, all you wanted
was Fafner, am I right?

186
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:10,416
Please don't misunderstand me.

187
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,708
I promised that I would
take you to a paradise

188
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:15,041
and that's exactly
what I'm going to do.

189
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:18,750
Well, I don't believe you now!
It's all a lie!

190
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:20,875
You're entitled to form
your own opinions,

191
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:23,875
but the place we're headed
to is a paradise to me.

192
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:25,333
You'll just have
to be patient and

193
00:16:25,416 --> 00:16:28,166
sit tight for a while,
until we get there.

194
00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:34,583
So are you satisfied now, Yukie?

195
00:16:35,666 --> 00:16:38,583
I'm afraid that boy
is still a bit too green.

196
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:39,958
You're right...

197
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,250
But so are you...

198
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:43,375
Hm?

199
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:45,875
We know about you
and Kozo Minashiro.

200
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:48,458
You got a little
too close to him.

201
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:50,833
But that was just...

202
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:52,458
Everyone here suspects you.

203
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:55,791
They're all saying you
might be a double agent.

204
00:16:57,916 --> 00:17:01,458
I'm just doing my job.
So no offense.

205
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:05,208
I'll make you pay for this!

206
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,583
You have to let me see him!

207
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:12,666
Then ask him
about me, you'll see!

208
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:15,875
You'll regret
treating me like this!

209
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:18,541
You listening to me, Michio?!

210
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:20,250
Michio Shino!

211
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:23,250
That woman's so noisy.
It's annoying me.

212
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:25,125
Looks like she hasn't
changed a single bit

213
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:27,250
since when I knew
her on the island.

214
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:28,916
Listen, if she
doesn't quiet down,

215
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,833
you have my permission
to put a gag on her.

216
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:50,500
At last, the Nothung
model is in my hands.

217
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:54,041
On behalf of the entire
world I must thank you.

218
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:57,000
You were a great
help Doctor Bertland.

219
00:17:57,833 --> 00:17:59,958
It'll surely aid
the Arcadian Project...

220
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:03,666
...so that it may contribute
a little to the human race.

221
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:18,125
Are you positive about that?

222
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:21,333
Replacing these two
is the only way I know

223
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:23,791
of to ensure the
survival of the island.

224
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:26,125
Besides I've received a
report that the preparations

225
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:29,041
on Fafner have
already been completed.

226
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:31,750
I feel somewhat responsible for

227
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:34,000
dragging Kazuki
into this mess...

228
00:18:34,083 --> 00:18:35,916
...and now these two...

229
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,875
Seems I'm the one
to blame for everything.

230
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:43,541
Don't think that way.
This incident is not your fault.

231
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:45,708
And neither is what
Mitsuhiro did in the past.

232
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:48,250
Everything was supposed
to have been settled.

233
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:51,375
I somehow think
he still believes

234
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:52,958
he can change the world.

235
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:57,416
And he's got it in his mind that
he can achieve this with Fafner.

236
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:01,916
Mitsuhiro left Tatsumiya Island
in order to go defeat Festum.

237
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:04,208
However, fighting battles with

238
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:06,708
nothing to protect
is meaningless.

239
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:10,875
I guess you could say that

240
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:13,750
Mitsuhiro's heart was
assimilated by Fafner...

241
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:15,666
He chose Fafner
over this island...

242
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,625
...and us...

243
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:28,375
I don't know why
I'm so tired today.

244
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,291
Welcome back, sis.

245
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:33,291
I just got home.

246
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:35,666
What's this?

247
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:38,416
It's the school event calendar.

248
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:43,291
Looks like we're still having
a graduation ceremony.

249
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:46,875
We have to, don't we?
We usually do...

250
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:49,333
Yeah, you're right.

251
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:54,375
The rumor about Kazuki...
have you heard it?

252
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:14,250
Oh, Maya...

253
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:19,458
Hey, Maya, what about me?
Will you remember what I'm like?

254
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:31,333
Kazuki...

255
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:34,500
I wonder where
you are right now.

256
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:36,833
I heard that you
were the last person

257
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:40,083
Kazuki talked to
before he left the island.

258
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:44,083
Soshi...

259
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:48,375
So what was it that
he talked to you about?

260
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:50,500
Well he...

261
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:53,791
Did he say he wanted
an escape from fighting?

262
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:55,666
Or was it...

263
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:59,041
...maybe he just
wanted an escape from me.

264
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:01,041
You're wrong.

265
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:05,375
All he really wanted was for me
to keep on remembering him.

266
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:07,291
I see.

267
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:15,875
There's something that I've also
wanted to ask you too.

268
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,625
What about you?

269
00:21:18,708 --> 00:21:21,708
Did Kazuki tell
you anything, Soshi?

270
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:26,708
No...
nothing...

271
00:21:26,791 --> 00:21:28,750
Well then why...

272
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:32,291
Then why did you
say that he escaped?

273
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:33,541
You should have helped him

274
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,916
and discussed more
things with Kazuki!

275
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,625
You're the one
who's running away!

276
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:42,166
Yeah? Well, you don't even
have a clue about it!

277
00:21:43,958 --> 00:21:45,500
We did...

278
00:21:46,708 --> 00:21:48,958
I thought we did...

279
00:21:50,791 --> 00:21:54,500
I was under the impression that
we understood each other.

280
00:21:55,291 --> 00:21:57,250
And so was Kazuki...

281
00:21:58,875 --> 00:22:02,750
It's obvious that he felt
the same way about you!

282
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,208
We shared our
feelings many times.

283
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:17,458
Our pain and even our
wounds formed one bond.

284
00:22:18,291 --> 00:22:21,625
But we wanted to understand
ourselves so much...

285
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:24,625
...that we forgot
about the others.

286
00:22:25,833 --> 00:22:28,041
How could we take it back?

287
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
We had no idea.

288
00:22:34,458 --> 00:22:39,416
♪ closing song ♪

289
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:41,375
The children who
are forced to fight.

290
00:23:42,166 --> 00:23:45,375
The adults who can only watch.

291
00:23:46,375 --> 00:23:50,541
And now...
he is no longer here.

292
00:23:54,083 --> 00:23:57,791
Next on Fafner
episode number 12.

293
00:23:57,875 --> 00:23:59,833
Desperation.

294
00:24:00,416 --> 00:24:02,000
Are you there?
