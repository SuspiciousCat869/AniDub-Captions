1
00:01:49,583 --> 00:01:51,708
Several objects are approaching
from the southwest.

2
00:01:51,791 --> 00:01:53,625
They'll be arriving
in thirty minutes.

3
00:01:53,708 --> 00:01:55,541
It's a large group of Festum...

4
00:01:55,625 --> 00:01:58,625
But we can win if
we defeat their leader.

5
00:01:58,708 --> 00:02:01,583
Start Vaffe Larden.
Engage!

6
00:02:01,666 --> 00:02:02,958
Number one and two Gnosis units!

7
00:02:03,041 --> 00:02:05,375
Intercept them off
the southwest bank.

8
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:06,958
Number three, four,
and five units.

9
00:02:07,041 --> 00:02:10,500
Set up a defense line on the
southwest coast of the island.

10
00:02:10,583 --> 00:02:12,125
Let's show these worms
of the universe what

11
00:02:12,208 --> 00:02:15,083
kind of power the
human race is capable of.

12
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,541
Now we'll see if the Neo UN
Force has any skills.

13
00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:22,041
I'm sure they won't
know how to use Solomon.

14
00:02:22,708 --> 00:02:25,041
Barns is actually an
excellent commander.

15
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:27,000
I'm sure that he won't
be defeated easily.

16
00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:28,166
I'm just praying that we're not

17
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,375
going to end up
like Moldova did.

18
00:02:30,458 --> 00:02:31,875
Hey, Yumiko.

19
00:02:31,958 --> 00:02:35,041
The CDC is now the
headquarters of Neo UN Force.

20
00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:36,375
What can you even do in there?

21
00:02:36,458 --> 00:02:38,250
I can't let people who
don't even understand

22
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:39,791
the system mess around with it.

23
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:43,250
Hey! Just what do
you think you're doing?!

24
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:44,250
This isn't the way I had

25
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:45,541
imagined meeting
you again either.

26
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:47,416
Trust me on that.

27
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:52,625
That really hurt.
Hey what are you doing?!

28
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:56,541
This'll all be over soon.
I need you to stay there, okay?

29
00:02:57,833 --> 00:03:00,375
Just knowing that you were alive
somewhere out there in the world

30
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:01,875
was the only thing
that gave me the

31
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:04,541
strength to keep on
fighting, Yumiko.

32
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:06,708
It's what kept me alive.

33
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:12,958
I'm sorry...

34
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:15,791
We got left behind
because I was too slow.

35
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:18,250
Never mind that.
By the way, are you all right?

36
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:22,416
This is my first time outside.
So I still can't walk well yet.

37
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,166
That's alright we'll
take lots of breaks.

38
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,125
Don't push yourself too hard.

39
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:27,125
Hey...

40
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:29,125
Is it okay to ask you a favor?

41
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:30,208
Sure go right ahead.

42
00:03:30,291 --> 00:03:31,791
You want to be
carried or something?

43
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:33,208
No.

44
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:37,791
I would be very happy if you
and I could become friends.

45
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:38,958
You see...

46
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:42,416
It's just that I don't
have any friends.

47
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,791
What are you talking about?

48
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:46,583
You've already got a
friend right here silly.

49
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:49,291
Thank you Seri.

50
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:50,375
That means a lot to me.

51
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:52,583
Don't think anything of it.

52
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:55,791
Huh?
Did I introduce myself, yet?

53
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:58,500
What's that?

54
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:01,291
It's the entrance
to the shelter.

55
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:03,500
Now, hurry in.

56
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:05,166
Okay.

57
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,000
I'm afraid I have to go.

58
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:08,291
Huh?

59
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:09,958
Seri, you stay down
there with everyone else.

60
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,541
But wait a minute.
Who are you?

61
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:13,916
Oh, that's right.
My name is Tsubaki.

62
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,541
It's Tsubaki Minashiro.

63
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:16,791
Minashiro?
Hey...!

64
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:19,208
Does that mean
you're one of Soshi's...?

65
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:21,416
It's a promise, okay?

66
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,875
You and I are gonna be friends.

67
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:38,500
The number one Walle Shield
has disappeared.

68
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:41,333
The enemy is still
headed right toward us.

69
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:43,208
They're advancing
in a straight line...

70
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:44,833
They've underestimated us.

71
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:47,541
Yes. The curfew
doesn't apply to me.

72
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:48,958
It's not like that.

73
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:51,916
It's for the people who are
physically weakened...

74
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:59,291
We humans shouldn't be
arguing at a time like this...

75
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:02,833
Hello?
Who is it?

76
00:05:02,916 --> 00:05:04,583
Chizuru.
Are you there?

77
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:05,791
Huh?

78
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:07,625
I have a favor to ask
you since you're the

79
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:09,500
one who put me into the system.

80
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:11,208
It's really you...

81
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:12,291
But how can that be?

82
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:14,375
I still can't walk
very well because

83
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:17,333
it's my first time outside.

84
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:19,375
So please... would
you mind bringing me

85
00:05:19,458 --> 00:05:22,583
something that you could
transport me with?

86
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:25,916
Sir, the Number two Walle
Shield has been breached.

87
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,458
Fire!

88
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,458
The colonel seems
pretty eager too.

89
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:34,958
Ain't that right, Kanon?

90
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:37,000
You're also livelier than usual.

91
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:39,000
Heh.
What do you expect?

92
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:40,833
I just reunited
with a lady friend.

93
00:05:40,916 --> 00:05:42,416
It's that woman...

94
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,125
The Nothung Models are here.

95
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:02,083
One's landed on the
southwest side and detonated.

96
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:04,416
We've got a few
Pleiades-types on our hands.

97
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,291
Triple Six, go out there
and provide back up.

98
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:09,291
I'm already here.

99
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:14,541
Kanon!

100
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:16,041
Bring the number three
unit around to the left!

101
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:17,750
We're gonna come
at them from both sides.

102
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:19,166
Roger.

103
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:20,708
Watch out!

104
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:21,833
What do you think you're doing?!

105
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:22,916
Careful, damnit!

106
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,125
Don't you know how
to use your radio?

107
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,833
Mark Drei. Come in.
Do you read me?

108
00:06:27,916 --> 00:06:29,208
It's cold.

109
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:32,291
The wind is so cold...

110
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:36,041
I can feel Fafner's surfaces as
if they were my own skin.

111
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:38,791
It's as if my body has
become really huge...

112
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:40,791
And it feels so heavy right now.

113
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:42,666
Those are the traits
of the Nothung Model.

114
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:45,708
Unite with it!
Accept the mind alteration!

115
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:49,791
Stop being an idiot!

116
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:52,583
If you don't stand up and fight,
you're going to die!

117
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:59,875
It is her.
Tsubaki Minashiro.

118
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:01,541
This is our first time.

119
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:04,666
Talking like this...
Chizuru.

120
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:13,166
We've made a direct attack on
three Serpent class Firma.

121
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:14,250
They've all sunk.

122
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:15,458
And what about
the head of the fleet?

123
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:16,791
We still can't find it.

124
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:19,125
Tell the remaining two
submarines to concentrate

125
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:22,041
all their attacks off
the southwest coast.

126
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:40,541
Hey wait a second.
Our allies are firing at us?

127
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:48,625
Tsubaki!

128
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:56,083
This is the first time
I've played in mud, ever!

129
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:00,958
How could they...?

130
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:02,833
Don't worry.
It's all right.

131
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:04,958
They're not burning everything.
It's just the surface.

132
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:08,375
The time has finally come.
They are about to choose now.

133
00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:10,375
A third group has
appeared in the west.

134
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:12,625
Those alien bastards...

135
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:14,583
Disconnect the
island's southwest wing,

136
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:16,125
and engage its self destruct.

137
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:19,375
We'll kill the enemy even if it
means destroying the island!

138
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:21,625
The system has started
interception on its own.

139
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:22,875
It's rejecting all our commands.

140
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:24,916
How could that be?

141
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,833
Why are those
components moving?!

142
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:30,500
Who's doing it?!
Who's in control?

143
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:32,083
I don't know sir.

144
00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:33,416
The door just unlocked.

145
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,916
Is it time to eat?

146
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:42,583
What the hell's going on?

147
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:44,000
Headquarters, come in?

148
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:46,250
It's no use.
I can't get through.

149
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:48,875
It looks like your chain of
command has been cut off.

150
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:51,000
Which means the
circumstances have changed.

151
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:53,750
Sorry but I'm not
staying here anymore.

152
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:56,375
Michio?

153
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,083
What the hell is this?

154
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:10,416
Who is the one doing that?

155
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:22,541
Kenji, are you okay?

156
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:23,875
Watch out.

157
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:30,166
Why is that section closing?

158
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,500
Someone is doing
it intentionally.

159
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:35,541
They're trying to
lead us in that direction.

160
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:45,541
Is that you... Tsubaki?

161
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,791
Re-establish our
line of defense!

162
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:51,541
Those who can
still move, advance!

163
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,666
A slew of Pleiades-types
have gathered

164
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,083
at the top of Mt. Tatsumiya.

165
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:02,041
They're directly above us!

166
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:03,916
They're above us?!

167
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:12,166
Tsubaki?!

168
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:14,250
I'm all right...

169
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:16,583
I was simply feeling
the island's pain.

170
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:18,250
I knew it.
Let's stop.

171
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:20,041
If anything happens to you...

172
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:22,208
The island will eventually
sink into the ocean

173
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:24,541
if I keep hiding like this.

174
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:26,333
And before that happens,

175
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:29,416
I need to allow everyone
to make their own choices.

176
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:38,458
Keel block...

177
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,791
Urdu fountain...

178
00:10:57,083 --> 00:10:59,583
Even though my
destiny has been laid out...

179
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:02,708
...are you telling me
to choose what I want...?

180
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:05,583
Is that it, Tsubaki?

181
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,916
What the heck is going on here?

182
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:12,333
We have no time to lose.
Hurry up and get in.

183
00:11:12,416 --> 00:11:13,583
You want us to pilot?

184
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:15,583
But we don't
even have any suits!

185
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:19,125
Kazuki got inside one
without the suit, didn't he?!

186
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:20,583
Besides...

187
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:22,916
If we don't fight now,
how can we ever face

188
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,583
Dad, Koyo, and the others again?

189
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,833
My job here is to
provide everybody with

190
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:30,666
something that all of them want.

191
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,833
And whether they
really want it or not.

192
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:36,083
I will let them choose for
themselves once again.

193
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:38,750
That is the same
with Festum as well.

194
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:41,666
I will also let them choose.

195
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,208
And it is for that purpose...

196
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:45,708
...that I was born.

197
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:48,041
Isn't that correct?

198
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,250
You should go back now.

199
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:52,583
It'll be safer in the shelter.

200
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,458
Thank you for coming all
the way here with me.

201
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:57,916
I appreciate it.

202
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,125
What is it?

203
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:02,875
I won't leave.
I'm going too.

204
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:06,333
But not as a system researcher,
as a resident as someone who

205
00:12:06,416 --> 00:12:10,166
lives on this island, I want
to see it with my own eyes.

206
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:14,583
Yumiko. You too?

207
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:15,708
How did you get in here?

208
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:19,083
Well, I think I was led here.

209
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:21,666
Do you know what this place is?

210
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,416
It's the main body of Solomon!
That means that this is...

211
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,791
So we're standing
in Arthur's room.

212
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:33,500
And this is the second CDC!

213
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:37,333
Everyone,
take your regular posts.

214
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:41,000
The basic structure here
is the same as the CDC.

215
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:42,916
Confirm all systems.

216
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:46,583
We are going to take
back control of the island!

217
00:12:58,416 --> 00:13:02,833
I am this island,
and this island is me...

218
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:05,041
What the people who
live here want to do

219
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:08,583
with the island is
completely up to them.

220
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:12,208
I will let them know what
it is they really want...

221
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:15,916
And the only way
I can do that...

222
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:18,750
...is by giving them a choice.

223
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:21,208
And through their choice...

224
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:24,458
...they will realize something.

225
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:27,875
I'm sorry I wasn't able to
let you choose for yourself.

226
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:31,083
But you're wrong.
I chose too.

227
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:34,125
I decided I wanted a heart.

228
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:37,416
That's what I ended
up choosing for myself.

229
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:43,375
And now look at me...
It's me.

230
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:44,875
I'm right here.

231
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:46,500
One hundred seventeen
of them have landed

232
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:49,083
on the island and the enemy's
power is still increasing.

233
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:51,416
It's a matter of time before
the Pleiades-types find us.

234
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,916
And the secondary
defense system?

235
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,750
I'm accessing it now.
Two minutes until completion.

236
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:57,083
The main body
producing the group

237
00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:58,625
is invalidating the search.

238
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:00,250
I can't find it.

239
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:01,333
Can you use the Fafners

240
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:03,291
as a decoy to lure the
enemy head out?

241
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:06,125
It's going to be difficult,
but I'll give it a shot.

242
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:08,583
Someone's singing!

243
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:10,625
It's impossible...

244
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:32,458
Solomon has responded!
It's the enemy head!

245
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:34,833
Concentrate all power to
the interception system!

246
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:36,250
Where's that song coming from?

247
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,458
The lighthouse on the west
side of Tatsumiya Island.

248
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:39,791
Onscreen...

249
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:40,833
It can't be...

250
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:43,958
So that's where she is.
Tsubaki...

251
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:47,125
Are you going to let the Festums
make their own choice, Tsubaki?

252
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:49,958
The enemy has started making
its way toward the lighthouse.

253
00:14:50,041 --> 00:14:51,458
Attention all Fafners!

254
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:53,333
Spread out and hurry to
the west end of the island.

255
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:55,000
Dodge any enemy units you see,

256
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:56,208
and gather at the
rendevous point.

257
00:14:56,291 --> 00:14:58,208
We're going to
attack the main body!

258
00:14:58,291 --> 00:14:59,750
You wait and see...

259
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:01,583
I'm going to defeat
every single enemy!

260
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:03,958
This is scary, really scary.

261
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:07,250
Go!
Goubain!

262
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:13,916
Wait, that's...

263
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,541
They're moving differently now.

264
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:17,708
Did they change
pilots or something?

265
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:20,458
Kanon.
I've located the enemy head.

266
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:21,625
We're moving west.

267
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:22,791
Roger.

268
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:25,708
Those who can
still fight, follow me.

269
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:26,708
Here we go!

270
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:28,500
Access is completed.

271
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:31,041
Let's give 'em
everything we've got!

272
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:43,166
Did we do it?

273
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:44,541
Here they come!

274
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:47,541
Mark Hguc, hold the
enemy in check with Aegis.

275
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:49,916
Mark Achat,
go around to the right side.

276
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Mark Drei, confirm
the enemy core and destroy it.

277
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:07,375
Kenji get away from it!

278
00:16:09,791 --> 00:16:10,875
I'm coming Kenji!

279
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:12,875
No, don't!
You'll break the formation!

280
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:15,250
You bastard!

281
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:32,916
Damnit!
We're too late.

282
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,041
Even the Nothung Models
were no match for it.

283
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:36,583
Above you!

284
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,541
You sneaky bastards!

285
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:45,750
They're such monsters!

286
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:47,083
It's too strong for us.

287
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:48,833
The target is making its way

288
00:16:48,916 --> 00:16:50,250
back towards the
lighthouse again.

289
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:51,250
And Tsubaki?

290
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:53,208
She hasn't moved.

291
00:16:58,375 --> 00:16:59,333
I see...

292
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:01,958
You have made
a choice as well...

293
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:04,333
A world without conversation...

294
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:06,750
...where everything disappears.

295
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:09,625
A path that leads to nothing.

296
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:18,083
However...

297
00:17:18,166 --> 00:17:19,625
You are not the only one.

298
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:22,791
Other people have
also made their choice.

299
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,500
Tsubaki.

300
00:17:25,166 --> 00:17:27,958
Tsubaki.
Let's try to escape.

301
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:30,791
Thank you, Chizuru.
Thank you very much.

302
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:35,125
But it's okay.
I'm going to be fine.

303
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:39,958
Welcome home.

304
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:46,125
That machine!
What the heck is it?

305
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:01,625
It caught the attack one handed!

306
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:09,916
That's what it did earlier!

307
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:17,875
This is not good!
It's gonna detonate!

308
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:22,250
My readings are showing that... 

309
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:25,000
...the enemy core is
disappearing from the inside.

310
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:26,833
That can only mean
that the Festum are...

311
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:30,166
They're being assimilated
by something else.

312
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:35,166
The target is
disappearing again!

313
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:36,166
What?

314
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:37,625
Solomon's response
has disappeared.

315
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:40,375
You can find it if
you look for it. Try Soshi.

316
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:42,166
I will Tsubaki!

317
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:44,541
Vibrations,
temperature fluctuations,

318
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:46,708
electron dispersions and
spatial phasing...

319
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:48,291
This is it!

320
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:51,250
The wound that was created when
that machine counter attacked.

321
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:53,625
Whoever's piloting,
can you hear me?

322
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:57,250
I've locked onto the enemy.
It's up to you to defeat it.

323
00:19:00,416 --> 00:19:02,375
It's Soshi...

324
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:05,166
Kazuki...
is that you?

325
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:07,666
We need to link our machines
and do a system crossing.

326
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:11,250
It should be the same as when
you do it with the Mark Elf.

327
00:19:12,791 --> 00:19:14,666
It's already too late.

328
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,583
How could you...

329
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:23,750
Soshi, you once told
me that this island

330
00:19:23,833 --> 00:19:26,166
was the only paradise left.

331
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:30,541
So I fought just like you said
I should, I went into battle,

332
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:33,791
without understanding
what you really meant by that.

333
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:35,666
After everything
I've been through...

334
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,916
I see things differently...

335
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:41,125
I understand a little better.

336
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:45,083
What is it that you understand?

337
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:47,500
That deep down inside...

338
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:50,916
...you have
suffered a great deal.

339
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:54,791
This whole time we knew nothing.

340
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:58,250
But you knew and tried
to protect the island.

341
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:02,083
In Shoko's case,
and in Koyo's case too.

342
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:04,541
You carried the pain alone.

343
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:07,083
And you never once...

344
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:12,208
What is the i.d.
code of that machine?

345
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:14,250
It's the Mark Sein.

346
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:17,500
I will register the unit
for system crossing.

347
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:19,583
Give me five seconds.

348
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:21,000
Are you all right?

349
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:22,916
It'll be done soon.

350
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:28,166
The enrollment has
been completed.

351
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:30,708
I'm starting the
system crossing now.

352
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:39,708
Kazuki, can you see what I see?

353
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:41,791
Yes I can.
I see it all.

354
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:43,291
Here we go!

355
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:54,875
What weapon is that?

356
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:56,708
It's the Mark Achat's
Garm Forty four,

357
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:59,000
but its energy levels
are tremendous.

358
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:01,875
I've never seen such power.

359
00:21:07,041 --> 00:21:09,375
Is that thing a Luger Lance?

360
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,958
♪ closing song ♪

361
00:23:39,291 --> 00:23:41,375
A conversation...

362
00:23:42,583 --> 00:23:45,875
...with a girl who
wasn't anywhere.

363
00:23:46,916 --> 00:23:49,458
There's not much time left.

364
00:23:51,958 --> 00:23:57,166
Next on Fafner:
episode number seventeen.

365
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:58,750
"A Device."

366
00:24:00,041 --> 00:24:01,958
Are you there?
