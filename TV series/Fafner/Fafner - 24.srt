Soshi!
Give us back Soshi!

3
00:02:06,291 --> 00:02:08,500
Give him back!

4
00:02:15,541 --> 00:02:20,750
Soshi!

5
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,541
But why...?

6
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:46,416
Why is it that I'm here...
What reason?

7
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:53,166
I see... Now that I have free
will the MIR has rejected me.

8
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,500
I must go then.

9
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:24,750
With the repair work we've been
doing for the past six days,

10
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:29,333
70% of the CDC's functions are
expected to be back online soon.

11
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:32,416
However, most of the
N Bloc is still in ruins...

12
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:34,791
But the restoration
that's underway of the

13
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:37,208
main facilities and
hangars is going smoothly.

14
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:38,458
I see...

15
00:03:38,541 --> 00:03:39,500
What if we decide to join

16
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:41,458
the Neo U.N.'s
attack operations?

17
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:43,041
Well...

18
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:45,125
Regarding the installation of
the Fafner's remote system...

19
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:47,458
As predicted the
adjustments aren't going well.

20
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:50,041
So... you dragged
an old woman all the way

21
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:52,291
out here to tell me this.

22
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,125
Tamotsu.

23
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:56,583
Fumihiko...
the new system adjustments...

24
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:58,291
Let me take care of it.

25
00:03:58,375 --> 00:03:59,750
I beg you!

26
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:01,958
I am going to make
those damn Festum suffer!

27
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:04,500
Just like they made
Mamoru and Chisato suffer!

28
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:06,125
Tamotsu!

29
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:08,916
Children are not tools.

30
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,583
You cannot use them
to seek your revenge.

31
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:14,541
It's my fault that they're gone.

32
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:17,291
Chisato...
and Ippei too...

33
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:20,708
It's because...
I wasn't there...

34
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:29,000
He promised me.
He said he wouldn't die.

35
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:32,333
He said he would keep his
promise no matter what.

36
00:04:32,416 --> 00:04:34,041
Oh Yumiko...

37
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,500
Hey there Kenji...
How are you?

38
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:44,666
They wanted me to come
over here and get you...

39
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:49,000
If you still don't want
to fight, we all understand.

40
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:50,958
I'm going to try my
best to do whatever

41
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:53,125
your mother would have wanted.

42
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:57,375
It shoulda been me...
I was too scared...

43
00:04:57,458 --> 00:04:59,333
And that's why...

44
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:06,875
Before, whenever I was
climbing this mountain,

45
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:09,708
I felt like I was climbing
on my dad's back.

46
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:10,958
But now...

47
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:14,250
I just don't feel that
way about it anymore.

48
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:19,208
I heard my dad might have died,
but it doesn't seem real to me.

49
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:22,166
I feel like... maybe I should
stop coming here to climb.

50
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:24,208
I see...

51
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:27,708
And you, Kazuki?
Why do you like to come here?

52
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:32,041
It's not so much me...
but my mom had liked it here.

53
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:35,875
Is it true there's another
enemy at North Pole?

54
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:38,041
That's what I'm
going to find out.

55
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:39,583
You don't have to go...

56
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:42,166
You could just
stay here on the island.

57
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:46,458
Actually... do you think you
could do that Maya?

58
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:50,291
If you're gonna leave, Kazuki,
then I want to go too.

59
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:54,500
Snow...?

60
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:58,083
Sorry... I just thought you
might be getting cold..

61
00:05:58,166 --> 00:06:01,291
Oh right.
Thanks a lot.

62
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:03,791
It feels so warm.

63
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:09,333
Listen to me Maya,
I want you to live on, okay?

64
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:19,625
After everything, I don't know
what to say to Kazuki.

65
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:22,166
What do I do Michio?

66
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:25,375
Hey there!

67
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:30,125
Hi Kenji... Is he going
to stay with you Mrs. Kaname?

68
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:31,666
That's right.

69
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:34,916
I've already discussed it with
Kenji and he's agreed to it.

70
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,916
Kenji.

71
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:40,041
You go ahead and stay there.

72
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:44,125
No one else has to die...
not ever again.

73
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:46,708
Kazuki! Please... you...

74
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:48,458
You have to fight me!

75
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:50,250
What is all this?

76
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:53,625
Kenji! You can't.
He hasn't even recovered yet.

77
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:57,166
We received a message
from a Neo U.N. patrol plane.

78
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,166
They want to know if we're
joining their operations.

79
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:00,833
Tell them we'll join
and make sure they

80
00:07:00,916 --> 00:07:02,541
give us the operation code.

81
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:03,958
Yes, sir!

82
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:08,250
Then does this mean, I can
ride a Nothung Model now?

83
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:09,833
That's right.

84
00:07:09,916 --> 00:07:12,416
The alien elements you injected
in your body have stabilized.

85
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,291
I'm so glad.

86
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:19,541
Mom...

87
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:21,750
There's something I would
like you to check out for me.

88
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:24,833
Don't do it Fumihiko.
Don't join their operation.

89
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:27,958
The enemy is trying to take
this fight to a global scale.

90
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:30,041
It turns out
Mitsuhiro was right.

91
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:32,833
We don't have any
other choice but to fight.

92
00:07:32,916 --> 00:07:34,416
Who cares!

93
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,250
We can still shield ourselves
and protect all of our children.

94
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:39,916
But Kazuki's already
planning to join their fight.

95
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,291
In order to avenge Soshi,
he'll do it alone if he has to.

96
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:45,541
He won't live very much longer.

97
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:48,750
And he can't wait for
Dr. Tohmi's research.

98
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:50,041
You can use what
little time he has

99
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:51,875
left to do many other things!

100
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:53,375
What would Akane have wanted?

101
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:55,625
What do you think she would
say to you if she were here?

102
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:58,958
I'm doing the best I can.
I don't know any other way!

103
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,291
We can't even provide them with
a reason to come back alive...

104
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:05,708
...with a reason to live.

105
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:11,416
It's not over yet!

106
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:15,791
Damnit!

107
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:23,416
Kazuki!

108
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,291
Don't worry, he's fine.

109
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:33,541
I'm sure Sakura
would be surprised

110
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:35,416
if she saw that.

111
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,416
You know, she once told me...

112
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,250
...that she could never be
interested in a weak man.

113
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:41,833
You see...

114
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:45,708
Sakura was looking for the same
type of man that her father was.

115
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,916
Kazuki, do you think
I'll ever be able to

116
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,916
become as brave as Mamoru was?

117
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,125
Yeah of course.
I know you can.

118
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:02,000
This time...
I'm going with you!

119
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:05,791
The target is on a
direct course for the island.

120
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:07,083
We know it's a Sphinx-type,

121
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:09,208
but there's a high
probability it's a new kind.

122
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:10,541
We're maintaining
the cloaking device

123
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:12,583
and ready to deploy
the Welle Shield.

124
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:16,291
Have the pilots be on standby!
Welle Shield at maximum power!

125
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:18,458
Once we make contact
with the enemy, separate the

126
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:20,875
eastern part of Takeru
Island and start Fenrir.

127
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:22,875
Those bastards
can have that part.

128
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:24,458
Additional enemy
combatants sighted

129
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:26,291
at a heading of two o'clock.

130
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:28,416
Then that first one
was just a decoy?

131
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,583
Commander!

132
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:30,500
The new target is
flying directly toward

133
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:32,041
the earlier one that appeared.

134
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:33,458
Why would it do that?

135
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:36,333
I'm receiving an image.
Projecting on the main monitor.

136
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:39,208
Uh...
what is that?

137
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:54,708
I don't believe it.

138
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:57,125
The Festum are
fighting each other.

139
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:11,208
That thing destroyed
the core with one blow.

140
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:12,583
Amazing...

141
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:19,208
The remaining Festum
has disappeared.

142
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:21,750
We're not even picking
up any trace elements.

143
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:24,208
The Welle Shield is coming down,
but I haven't done anything.

144
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:25,291
But how?

145
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,208
Incoming message.
It's in Japanese.

146
00:10:27,291 --> 00:10:28,083
What is going on?

147
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:29,166
What does it say?!

148
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:30,541
Oh... right!

149
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:32,500
More of them
are headed your way.

150
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:35,166
I need to talk to you.
I will wait at the mountain.

151
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:36,333
Akane Makabe.

152
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:38,208
It's from Akane?
But how?

153
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:40,416
It can't be...

154
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:57,458
Welcome back.

155
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:09,625
There is nothing
biologically that

156
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:11,458
connects me to
this place anymore.

157
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:15,250
However, I believe I was led
here by my previous memories.

158
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:17,083
So you really do understand what

159
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:19,416
it's like to have
human memories.

160
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,458
I knew that you would.

161
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:25,291
I want you to meet
someone. He's on his way.

162
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:33,250
All right.
I'm here.

163
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:35,250
What do you want, Festum?

164
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:36,291
What are you up to?

165
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:37,750
I find it impossible
to believe that

166
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:39,250
Festum would fight each other.

167
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:41,916
Solomon has determined
that it is a master-type.

168
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,958
It's a Master-type.
A kind of Festum that's...

169
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:46,833
...human-shaped.

170
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:49,958
Are you saying that all Festum
are just parts of the whole?

171
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:52,250
If you consider
the situation carefully,

172
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:54,750
you will see
that it is possible.

173
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:58,791
However, you cannot predict what
they will potentially become.

174
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:00,500
I don't quite understand?

175
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:03,625
It is extremely rare for us to
develop individual personalities

176
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:05,958
as a result of
assimilating with humans.

177
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:09,333
They usually become immediately
homogenized into the collective.

178
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:11,791
But the entity that had
been Akane Makabe

179
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:14,666
managed to keep forming
its own resonant core.

180
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,125
The change was very slight.

181
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:18,208
And it took almost
ten years for it to be able

182
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:20,250
to have any influence
on the collective.

183
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:23,875
Actually, we only developed the
concept you humans call time

184
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:27,000
because of the many factors
that she exposed us to.

185
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:28,750
To us, time was like gravity.

186
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:31,750
It's a natural part of the
universe that we hardly notice.

187
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:34,250
But the entity that was
previously known as Akane Makabe

188
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:36,333
connected with many cores
and we have in turn,

189
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:40,375
formed a reality on which
time is the ultimate plane.

190
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:42,375
Why'd it only happen with her?

191
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:45,625
How many millions of other
people have been victimized?

192
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:47,125
We are currently
still searching for the

193
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:50,000
answer to that
question ourselves.

194
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:51,916
The most basic explanation
we've come up with

195
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,333
is that it is
"a phenomenon."

196
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:55,500
So in other words...

197
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:57,583
It means that Akane
Makabe herself

198
00:12:57,666 --> 00:13:00,041
had hoped to be assimilated.

199
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:02,333
I dare you to say it again.

200
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:03,958
Do not misunderstand.

201
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:06,708
She did not seek for it to be
and it was of course unexpected.

202
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:09,208
But from the moment
she made contact with us...

203
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:12,000
...she whole-heartedly welcomed
us and she blessed us.

204
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:13,750
What do you mean by blessed?

205
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:16,125
That is the only word that can
most closely describe the

206
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:19,375
experience that occurs on
our level of existence.

207
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:22,041
The assimilation and
destruction of entities are a

208
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:24,375
blessing to those who
exist in our space.

209
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:27,333
However, your Akane Makabe
reversed the effect.

210
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:30,375
Reversed it?
And what does that mean?!

211
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:34,333
She is the first of the
human entities to understand us.

212
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:38,000
Our latest results show that
the Festum are entirely

213
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:40,458
composed of a silicon
type of substance.

214
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:43,708
That's the most abundant
element that exists in space.

215
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:46,250
In other words,
it's sort of like they're soil.

216
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:48,916
So, while Minashiro and the
others are out there busting

217
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,375
their buts analyzing the MIR,
you're trying to better

218
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:54,500
understand the Festum by getting
your hands a little dirty?

219
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:55,750
It's just that...

220
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:58,250
I really wish I could
communicate with them.

221
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:00,458
I'd like you to
do this Fumihiko.

222
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:02,166
Try putting your
hands in the soil.

223
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,000
Who knows, someday
you may be able

224
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:06,708
to understand the
Festums' feelings.

225
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:10,791
Why...
why did you come here?

226
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:12,375
Because
I need a favor,

227
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:15,000
but it is something that only
one of your kind can perform.

228
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:16,583
A favor?

229
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:18,916
The core which is of greatest
importance and relation to me

230
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,666
is the core
of Akane Makabe

231
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:23,083
and the key to our
unanswered questions.

232
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:24,375
However because of that,

233
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:26,875
the North Pole MIR has
been holding it captive.

234
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:30,625
It is facing extinction and so
I want you to go rescue it.

235
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:33,041
Are you saying you're willing to
eliminate your colleagues?

236
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:35,666
Originally, we existed
as one, as a whole.

237
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:38,791
To put it in other words,
we were not separate...

238
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:42,625
Therefore neither diversion nor
mutual extinction were possible.

239
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:44,458
But Akane Makabe
changed things for

240
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:47,416
us and gave us all one
universal wound.

241
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,625
One wound?

242
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:50,750
Everything began the
moment it was clear

243
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:53,125
that Akane Makabe understood us.

244
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:54,916
She blessed us,
acknowledging us when

245
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,083
we weren't supposed to
exist anywhere.

246
00:14:57,166 --> 00:14:58,958
As a result,
it antagonized the MIR

247
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:01,250
and I was made a solitary being.

248
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:02,500
Wait a minute.

249
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:04,625
So you exist as an
individual now?

250
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:05,791
That's right.

251
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:07,666
I stand before you
now as the entity

252
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:10,625
who has inherited
Akane Makabe's will.

253
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:13,208
However, without your help.

254
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:16,333
I soon will once
again no longer exist.

255
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,625
Once the MIR succeeds in
extinguishing the core,

256
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:20,583
it will be as it was
in the beginning.

257
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:22,166
And Akane...?

258
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,625
Is she still communicating
with the other Festum?

259
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:26,916
The message she has
communicated has multiplied

260
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,833
and continues to resonate.

261
00:15:28,916 --> 00:15:31,500
Before the human race and
the MIR annihilate each other,

262
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:34,000
I would like for you
to connect my core.

263
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:35,666
I'm sure I will be
able to give you all

264
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,625
the resources that
you will need.

265
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:39,833
What can a Festum
possibly give us?

266
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:41,375
Unless you're planning
on returning all the

267
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:43,750
innocent lives that
you took away?

268
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:46,541
I cannot.
That is impossible.

269
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:48,791
Even we cannot turn back time.

270
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:51,375
However, in the future
where the effects

271
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:52,708
of time have yet to occur.

272
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:55,375
We can still
share mutual desires.

273
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:56,958
Go ahead and show them the data.

274
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:58,875
I'm sure they will
then understand.

275
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:02,166
They do not share the concepts
we have of the data.

276
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:06,541
It's all right. I have faith
that you'll be able to do it.

277
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:09,125
We are receiving enormous
amounts of incoming data.

278
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:11,666
It's too much for us to save.
Send it to the main server!

279
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,041
It is automatically doing that!

280
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:15,041
What exactly is happening here?

281
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:16,458
This is it?

282
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:18,750
This is how to defend
ourselves against the Festum?

283
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:20,083
It's Yoji.

284
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:23,083
Instead of defeating as many
of the enemy as possible,

285
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:25,875
we should be trying to
prolong the lives of soldiers.

286
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:28,208
Yoji Hino designed
this strategy.

287
00:16:28,291 --> 00:16:30,916
It's a human body combined
with that of the Festum.

288
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,875
The genetic and
psychological patterns...

289
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:34,833
...including the
internal organs...

290
00:16:34,916 --> 00:16:36,041
Is it really you?

291
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:39,375
Are you co-existing
with the Festum Akane?

292
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,833
That is everything that I can
hand over to you for right now.

293
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:44,416
Most of the answers they seek

294
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,791
are still locked up,
guarded inside the MIR.

295
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:48,125
It's all right.

296
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:49,916
It should be enough to make
everyone understand.

297
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Right, Fumihiko?

298
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:54,916
If we can rescue
this core for you,

299
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,375
does this mean our
pilots will be saved?

300
00:16:57,458 --> 00:16:59,375
The assimilation of
their corporeal bodies

301
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:01,041
is merely the first step.

302
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:03,833
The resonant core of Akane
Makabe has been able to

303
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:06,916
produce many answers
that go beyond that.

304
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,250
But how are we going
to make it through that

305
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:10,250
battlefield to even
reach the MIR?

306
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:12,791
I have already provided you
with the optimum method.

307
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:15,000
Follow it and
proceed to the MIR.

308
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:17,625
After that, my core will lead
you the rest of the way.

309
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:20,166
If everything goes well,
you will be able to retrieve

310
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:22,125
one thing that has been
taken away from you.

311
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,625
And what is that?

312
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:24,833
You'll be able to retrieve the

313
00:17:24,916 --> 00:17:26,791
thing you call the
Siegfried System.

314
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:27,791
What?

315
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:29,125
The MIR believed
that by taking it

316
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:30,625
we could steal all
of your power.

317
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:32,916
However we are unable to use it.

318
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,375
And that is the reason why
the MIR is still keeping the

319
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:37,666
one human who can
operate it alive.

320
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:40,291
Do you mean the person
who is in the system itself?

321
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:41,333
That's right.

322
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:44,083
A human being named
Soshi Minashiro.

323
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:48,208
Soshi...
That means he's alive.

324
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:49,541
They're here.

325
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:52,750
They have come this time
to destroy both you and I.

326
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:54,041
What?

327
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:57,166
We're detecting
numerous gravity shifts!

328
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,125
Ten...
twenty...

329
00:17:58,208 --> 00:17:59,500
It's still increasing...

330
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:01,750
Send the children of Alvis to
the MIR immediately.

331
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:04,083
We will do our best
to protect this island.

332
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:04,875
We?

333
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:07,458
Here he comes.

334
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:10,666
Koyo.

335
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:13,208
Were you the one who
ordered him to help you?

336
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:16,166
He was the one who chose
to fight alongside other

337
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:18,500
beings that were
similar to himself.

338
00:18:18,583 --> 00:18:21,791
Thank... you...

339
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:23,208
...all of you.

340
00:18:23,291 --> 00:18:23,875
--Koyo!
--Koyo!

341
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:24,833
Koyo.

342
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:27,291
Goodbye everybody.

343
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:38,375
Thank you Koyo.

344
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:41,333
I'll accept your offer,

345
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:43,708
but only for the sake
of those on this island.

346
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:45,333
That is reason enough.

347
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:49,166
I am sure we will both evolve
from this experience.

348
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:53,375
Tell me... Why did
you use Akane's name?

349
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:57,208
Because it would have provided
me with the optimum results.

350
00:18:57,291 --> 00:18:58,583
Actually...

351
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:01,583
I wanted to make sure
I would be able to see you.

352
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:03,875
That's right...

353
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:06,625
...to tell you something
special in person.

354
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:10,625
Thank you so
much Fumihiko.

355
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:13,416
For raising Kazuki.

356
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:18,041
Status report!

357
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:21,375
The gravitational shifts
have all stabilized.

358
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:32,750
This will lessen the
effects of assimilation.

359
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:34,416
We learned
of it from Akane.

360
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,333
When we administered
this to Sakura,

361
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:39,250
it began to work
almost immediately.

362
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:43,125
We were able to divide the
Siegfried System prototype

363
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:45,875
into four and put
them in each Fafner.

364
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:48,166
Therefore, everyone should
be able to cross over

365
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:50,250
and communicate
directly with each other.

366
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:52,416
And thanks to the new
data that the master-type

367
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,541
provided us with,
we've resolved any fears

368
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:57,083
that we had of
overloading the pilots.

369
00:19:57,166 --> 00:19:58,583
Every single one of us owes

370
00:19:58,666 --> 00:20:01,500
Akane Makabe our
deepest gratitude.

371
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:04,375
This setup does have two
important drawbacks though.

372
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:06,333
The first being
that every pilot will

373
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:08,750
sensorially experience
each other's pain.

374
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:10,041
Soshi has been experiencing

375
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:12,250
each of our pains
for a long time.

376
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:14,458
If he can do it then we can too.

377
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:16,791
The second is that if
we lose a single Fafner,

378
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:19,208
the system will be compromised.

379
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:22,333
Which means no one can die.
Understood?

380
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:23,958
We aren't going there to die.

381
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:26,208
We're all going
to come back alive.

382
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:29,458
Then I will go ahead and verify
each unit with their pilot.

383
00:20:29,541 --> 00:20:31,333
Mark Sein, Kazuki Makabe.

384
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:32,083
Roger.

385
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:34,083
Mark Acht, Kenji Kondo.

386
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:35,041
Roger!

387
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:36,791
Mark Sieben, Maya Tohmi.

388
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:37,750
Roger.

389
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:39,916
Mark Drei, Canon Memphis.

390
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,083
I'm piloting, Sakura's Fafner?

391
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:43,416
That's right.

392
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,500
You have ten hours to make
any adjustments needed.

393
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:47,250
Understood sir!

394
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:49,458
The objective of the attack
on the North Pole MIR,

395
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:51,500
is to make contact
with the specified core,

396
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,208
and obtain the rest of the data.

397
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:55,666
We will also be
recovering Soshi Minashiro.

398
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:58,166
These are the two
objectives of this operation.

399
00:20:58,250 --> 00:20:59,875
So what are we
calling this operation?

400
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:02,791
The Neo U.N.'s been calling
their operation Heaven's Door,

401
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:05,041
since in order for it to
succeed it demands that

402
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:07,041
they break through to
the outer atmosphere.

403
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:08,458
Well that's a bad omen.

404
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:10,916
Since we'll be flying our team
there in the Devil Rey.

405
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,666
Why don't we just call it
something like "sky"?

406
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,500
On that day, the
weather conditions are

407
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:17,333
expected to be good up there.

408
00:21:17,416 --> 00:21:19,833
In that case, how
about we name it "Azure"?

409
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:21,291
Why Azure?

410
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:22,791
What does "azure" mean?

411
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:25,041
It means a sky
that's big and blue.

412
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:26,541
That's a cool name!

413
00:21:26,625 --> 00:21:28,208
Well then that's that.

414
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:30,208
We will commence
with Operation Azure

415
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:32,958
in exactly sixteen
hours from now.

416
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:35,708
I'll be waiting for you
at the hanger, okay?

417
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:36,916
Um...

418
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,375
Yes?
What is it?

419
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:40,916
If I manage to
come back alive...

420
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,416
...do you think that...

421
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,666
I could call you Mom?

422
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:47,625
Of course.

423
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:50,916
And I'll be awaiting
your return, Canon. Don't worry.

424
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:53,875
Sis, is it really true?

425
00:21:53,958 --> 00:21:55,250
It is.

426
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:57,833
It's the first natural
conception in thirty years.

427
00:21:57,916 --> 00:21:59,208
So then it's Michio's.

428
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:01,083
A child.

429
00:22:01,166 --> 00:22:03,625
So he managed to
keep his promise to me...

430
00:22:03,708 --> 00:22:05,208
...in the end.

431
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:08,416
I'd like you to show my child
that there is still hope yet.

432
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:12,625
All is not lost.
It can still have a future.

433
00:22:22,166 --> 00:22:24,125
Dad, if you wouldn't
mind I'd like you to

434
00:22:24,208 --> 00:22:26,208
teach me something
when I get back?

435
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:27,750
Yes... What is it?

436
00:22:27,833 --> 00:22:28,875
I'd like to learn
how to work with

437
00:22:28,958 --> 00:22:31,916
soil or perhaps make pottery.

438
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Sure. I'd be happy to
teach you those things.

439
00:22:35,083 --> 00:22:37,500
You know I learned
them from your mother.

440
00:22:38,166 --> 00:22:41,291
Thanks a lot...
dad.

441
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:47,250
♪ closing song ♪

442
00:22:48,208 --> 00:22:50,416
Okay you guys,
give me your arms.

443
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,291
Why?

444
00:22:51,375 --> 00:22:52,666
Here.

445
00:22:53,958 --> 00:22:56,583
Alright, you're next Kenji.

446
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:58,125
Is this like some kind of spell?

447
00:22:58,208 --> 00:22:59,375
Hey wait...

448
00:22:59,458 --> 00:23:00,916
...those are Tatsumiya
Island's coordinates.

449
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,250
That's right.

450
00:23:02,333 --> 00:23:04,416
It symbolizes the promise
we made to come back.

451
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,541
Do you want it too?

452
00:23:05,625 --> 00:23:07,500
Yeah, sure.
Go ahead.

453
00:23:08,125 --> 00:23:09,750
Thanks a lot Maya.

454
00:23:09,833 --> 00:23:11,083
Hey Maya.

455
00:23:11,458 --> 00:23:12,958
If you want...

456
00:23:13,041 --> 00:23:14,875
I could write
yours for you.

457
00:23:15,916 --> 00:23:17,583
That'd be nice.

458
00:23:24,916 --> 00:23:29,541
Let's go then! And make
sure we all come back!

459
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:42,458
The great white battlefield.

460
00:23:42,541 --> 00:23:44,416
Individual justice.

461
00:23:46,416 --> 00:23:49,375
The return to the island alive.

462
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:56,000
Next on Fafner episode
number twenty-five.

463
00:23:57,416 --> 00:23:59,041
"Symbiosis."

464
00:24:00,333 --> 00:24:01,791
Are you there?
