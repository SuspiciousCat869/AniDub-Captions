Safety check on
Section 8 complete.

3
00:01:50,125 --> 00:01:53,208
Welcome to the Neo U.N.
base here in Moldova.

4
00:01:53,291 --> 00:01:55,583
We're over four hundred
meters underground.

5
00:01:55,666 --> 00:01:57,208
Which means at
this depth Festum is

6
00:01:57,291 --> 00:02:00,208
unable to use any
mind reading abilities.

7
00:02:03,416 --> 00:02:04,916
All other other maintenance

8
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,250
crew members
report to section 3.

9
00:02:07,333 --> 00:02:08,791
I'll see ya later Kazuki.

10
00:02:08,875 --> 00:02:11,208
Thanks for telling me about
the island it was very helpful.

11
00:02:11,291 --> 00:02:12,833
It was helpful?

12
00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:16,000
What's going to
happen to him Michio?

13
00:02:16,083 --> 00:02:18,583
I guess that he'll be
a guinea pig for the VIPs.

14
00:02:18,666 --> 00:02:21,166
What's the use of
investigating a guy like that?

15
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:23,416
"To try and find out
what the Japanese people,

16
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,958
who were on the
verge of extingtion,

17
00:02:25,041 --> 00:02:26,875
were trying to do."

18
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,500
It's just like I expected,

19
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:40,791
he's exactly the same
as a normal human.

20
00:02:41,208 --> 00:02:42,500
He definitely
has some sort of

21
00:02:42,583 --> 00:02:44,833
cellular fusion at
the genetic level.

22
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:45,875
But then...

23
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:47,750
...can he really
be human like that?

24
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:49,041
He's a new breed of human

25
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:51,875
who's developed the
ability to resist Festum.

26
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:53,625
Thirty years ago,

27
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:55,208
the toxin released
from the core of

28
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:58,208
Festum robbed the Japanese of
their ability to have children.

29
00:02:58,291 --> 00:02:59,458
It was the beginning of the

30
00:02:59,541 --> 00:03:02,416
attempted genocide
of humanity by Festum.

31
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:07,333
To prevent the
horror from expanding,

32
00:03:07,416 --> 00:03:08,833
the world chose to destroy

33
00:03:08,916 --> 00:03:11,833
the core and
along with it, Japan.

34
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:13,583
The Japanese survivors banded

35
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:15,583
together and
called themselves Alvis.

36
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:17,791
and they started
the Arcadian Project.

37
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:19,208
But how did they
keep the Japanese

38
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:21,875
race alive without
the ability to conceive?

39
00:03:21,958 --> 00:03:23,541
An artificial uterus.

40
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:25,541
During the research process,

41
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:28,083
the children developed an
immunity to the core's toxin,

42
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:31,166
and began to grow in
power, equaling Festum.

43
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,958
Therefore the
children of Alvis are

44
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:34,541
the only ones who
are capable of being

45
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:36,708
the to be natural
enemies of Festum.

46
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:41,041
Gene manipulation,
manufacturing its own Fenrir,

47
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:43,666
Unauthorized use of
the nuclear reactor...

48
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,083
Alvis is like a gang of

49
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:46,791
international
criminals, isn't it?

50
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:48,541
And to insure their survival,

51
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:51,458
they isolated themselves
from any other humans.

52
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:53,708
You were originally
a member of Alvis,

53
00:03:53,791 --> 00:03:55,583
isn't that right, Dr. Bertrand?

54
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:58,000
We did use each
other for a while.

55
00:03:58,083 --> 00:04:01,208
But now I only have
one goal in mind...

56
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:03,041
To develop a
powerful weapon with

57
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:06,875
a genetically engineered pilot
that can destroy Festum.

58
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:14,041
It's been a week
since Kazuki's been gone...

59
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:16,625
I wonder if he's
ever coming back.

60
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:19,000
We're all right by
ourselves, aren't we?

61
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:20,708
Yeah, come to think of it,

62
00:04:20,791 --> 00:04:22,708
Koyo's parents
left too, didn't they?

63
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:24,500
And before that, Michio?

64
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:26,041
Oh that's right, Michio,

65
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:29,250
I can hardly remember
anything about him though.

66
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:35,500
Gee, what's her problem?

67
00:04:36,416 --> 00:04:37,708
Hmm?

68
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:38,750
Oh!

69
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:40,666
I forgot about Maya's Dad...!

70
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,708
He left the island too?

71
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:55,833
We've detected a flying object

72
00:04:55,916 --> 00:04:57,583
two hundred
kilometers off shore.

73
00:04:57,666 --> 00:04:59,750
And it's transmitting
some sort of video.

74
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:02,583
Perhaps it is a Neo U.N.
propaganda plane.

75
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:03,625
Show the image.

76
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:04,916
Yes sir.

77
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,125
This video is being
transmitted simultaneously

78
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:09,000
all over the world,
by the brave people

79
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:12,000
in charge of public
relations for the Neo U.N.

80
00:05:12,541 --> 00:05:13,916
It has been over thirty years

81
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,041
since the first
Festum invasion in 2114.

82
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:19,500
We have paid dearly
and made many sacrifices

83
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:22,958
to guarantee the human
race's continued existence.

84
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:24,541
We've had a major break through,

85
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:27,958
we've acquired a power that is
great enough to defeat Festum!

86
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:29,375
We now reveal to you the

87
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:32,166
magnificent
Fafner Nothung Model!

88
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:33,333
What's that?

89
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,041
No way!

90
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:39,291
As you know,
the enemy reads our minds.

91
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:41,083
making all of
our battle strategies

92
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:43,583
useless as they are
all known in advance.

93
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:45,166
The bigger our unit became,

94
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,375
the harsher battles
we were forced to fight.

95
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:48,750
But this machine prevents

96
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:50,750
the enemy's
mind reading abilities.

97
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:53,250
It is the best weapon
in human history.

98
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:55,750
It can battle alone,
and will allow our troops

99
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:58,791
to engage in a more
intensive attack as well!.

100
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:00,625
Now is the time
for us to finally

101
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:01,958
take back our Mother Earth,

102
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:05,333
and defeat the wretched
enemy once and for all!

103
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:10,166
But we were only able to
acquire one of those machines.

104
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,625
Oh don't worry about it.

105
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:14,458
Using that machine with our
defenses should be enough.

106
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,666
Using our Fafner
without permission...

107
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,500
...what are they thinking?

108
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:20,625
What's worse, is that
once people see what

109
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:22,333
Fafner can do
they will believe that

110
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:24,041
Festum can be defeated easily.

111
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:26,166
Well we know
one thing for sure...

112
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:28,083
Kazuki is with the Neo U.N...

113
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:31,000
And as hard as it is to believe,
he may be cooperating with them.

114
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:32,333
Maybe he thinks he's gonna save

115
00:06:32,416 --> 00:06:34,333
the world and be
some sort of hero.

116
00:06:34,416 --> 00:06:35,833
Kazuki wouldn't do that.

117
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:37,000
You're wrong about him!

118
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:38,250
Hmm?

119
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:39,833
Kazuki didn't want to be
thought of in that way,

120
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:42,166
he was never
trying to be a hero!

121
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:43,791
He left the island
because he wanted

122
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:46,625
to be thought of as
a person, not a fighter.

123
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:49,208
But no one...

124
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:51,833
...no one even
bothered to ask Kazuki

125
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:54,583
how he was feeling
about everything!

126
00:06:57,541 --> 00:07:01,250
Why are you all saying
such awful things!

127
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:08,708
It's been a long time,
Kazuki Makabe.

128
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:09,541
Huh?

129
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:10,583
I'm Yoji Hino.

130
00:07:10,666 --> 00:07:12,250
I was on the
island five years ago.

131
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:13,208
Do you remember?

132
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:14,458
Mr. Hino?

133
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:16,000
I remember.

134
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:17,291
Kazuki.

135
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:19,000
I heard that you met
my son while on the ship.

136
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:19,958
Yes.

137
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:21,625
Michio and I spoke.

138
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:22,875
He's the one who captured me.

139
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:24,333
Doesn't surprise me.

140
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:25,875
He's very good at what he does.

141
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:28,291
He becomes quite
violent when he pilots Fafner

142
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:30,416
due to the influence
of the synergetic code.

143
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,250
Please try and
forgive him, would you?

144
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:34,666
So, what are you planning
to do to me anyway?

145
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,250
Well that's mostly up to you.

146
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:37,250
Huh?!

147
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:38,583
Here are your choices,

148
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,625
you can either fight
as part of the battle force,

149
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:42,208
or you can work
for the soldiers

150
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:44,041
as a Neo U.N. staff member?

151
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:45,750
That's the safer
of the two options.

152
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:47,041
Really?

153
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:48,291
Are there any other choices?

154
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:49,166
'fraid not.

155
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:50,583
In the last thirty years,

156
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:52,583
our choices as humans have
been reduced drastically.

157
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:54,375
We can either fight
or help the fighters.

158
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:55,916
The only other
option we have is to

159
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,416
give up and be
destroyed by the enemy...

160
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,750
On the island...

161
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:02,000
...that wouldn't happen
because nobody gives up.

162
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:05,125
The island is certainly full of
a lot of fond memories for me,

163
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:07,708
but unfortunately a lot
of us had to move on.

164
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:10,583
And not too happily either,
but it had to be done.

165
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:12,291
Can I ask you something?

166
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:14,500
Why did you decide
to leave the island Mr. Hino?

167
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:16,625
Because my job is
to create the best possible

168
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:19,333
weapons to help out
the Neo U.N. fighting force.

169
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:22,416
I don't do it to destroy as
many of the enemy as possible.

170
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,916
My goal is to help as many
soldiers as I can survive.

171
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,791
But now, it appears that my
job has changed a little bit.

172
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:29,875
Changed in what way?

173
00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:31,083
Tell you what Kazuki,

174
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:33,041
why don't you come stay
at my place awhile?

175
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:35,000
But aren't I a prisoner here?

176
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:36,958
Am I really allowed to do that?

177
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:40,250
I am an officer of the
Neo U.N. General Staff.

178
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:42,041
I can make certain allowances.

179
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:43,625
If you come and work with me,

180
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:47,083
I may be able to show you
a way other than fighting.

181
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:50,791
I don't believe there
is another way...

182
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:53,625
Give it some thought
before you decide.

183
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,333
Oh, and by the way...

184
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:58,250
Why did you finally
choose to leave the island?

185
00:08:58,333 --> 00:08:59,500
Because I needed to find out

186
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:02,041
what I was really
fighting for myself.

187
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:03,500
I was beginning to feel as if

188
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:06,000
I was stuck in the
middle of nowhere.

189
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:08,875
Fumihiko should
be very proud of you.

190
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:11,125
I hope that you're
aware of that.

191
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:17,541
A way...
other than fighting.

192
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:25,750
Where is Akane?

193
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:28,458
She went over to the container
deck not too long ago

194
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:29,541
I'm not surprised,

195
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:32,041
she must have
noticed Mark Elf's core.

196
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:47,041
It won't work
with our physiology.

197
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:48,625
We would not
think that it would,

198
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:50,375
for it does not belong to us.

199
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:52,416
Well that does
not matter anymore.

200
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,541
It is now time that
we fulfill our destiny.

201
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:59,833
Yes it is, we are aware of what
we are pre ordained to do.

202
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:03,041
That core was extracted from the

203
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:06,041
Mir that destroyed
Japan a long time ago.

204
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:07,666
It's ironic that the very thing

205
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:10,583
that made people lose faith
is now their only hope!

206
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:12,041
Yes, we agree with you.

207
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:14,541
We understand how
very strange this must be.

208
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:16,416
I don't think that
you do understand.

209
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,708
I mean you Festum
are only here because you

210
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:21,000
want to possess a greater
understanding of humans,

211
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:22,416
isn't that right?

212
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,166
Do you know why I haven't
told Mitsuhiro about you?

213
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,458
Any idea at all?

214
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:27,541
One side knows.

215
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:28,916
The other side does not.

216
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,833
The amount of
possibilities varies with the

217
00:10:30,916 --> 00:10:32,750
individual character
of the human.

218
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:34,333
That's part of it,
but the bigger part

219
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:36,083
is an individual's personality.

220
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:37,625
I chose a different
direction than

221
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:40,000
Mitsuhiro or
the Arcadian Project.

222
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:42,666
I know, you chose
to work with me instead.

223
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:43,708
No I didn't.

224
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:45,875
I chose to follow Akane Makabe.

225
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:48,250
She was a human scientist
who was assimilated

226
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:49,833
by you quite some time ago.

227
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:52,125
Akane Makabe
is no longer present.

228
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:53,875
In order to see if that's true,

229
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:56,583
I think you ought to
meet Kazuki Makabe.

230
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:59,750
It might initiate a new
evolutionary divergence.

231
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:01,333
One that both the human race

232
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:04,708
and Festum have
not yet experienced.

233
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:09,416
They are trying to turn
Fafner into their savior.

234
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,083
In the old days, they would
have destroyed it immediately.

235
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:14,041
But since Mitsuhiro
has taken the lead,

236
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:16,083
the Neo UN has
changed quite a bit.

237
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:19,666
So by that are you implying then
that we haven't changed at all?

238
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,791
No, we're advancing
little by little.

239
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:23,291
Nothing stays unchanged.

240
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:24,625
Sometimes, when I come here,

241
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:26,750
I really don't think
we've changed at all.

242
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:28,000
I'm looking so far ahead,

243
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:30,416
yet I feel like somehow
I'm falling behind.

244
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,875
Thanks to your
research, the pilots'

245
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:33,708
chromosome mutations
have been brought

246
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:35,666
under relatively stable control.

247
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:38,875
I would hardly call that
falling behind Chizuru.

248
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:44,333
I would really
like to ask Kazuki

249
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:47,041
what he thinks about
the assimilation.

250
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:48,875
He has been in
battles with Festum.

251
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,666
I want to know his perspective
on the assimilation phenomena

252
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:54,625
and if he sees it as
a positive evolution...

253
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:55,833
Oh you do?

254
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:57,166
Why?

255
00:11:57,791 --> 00:11:59,375
Because I'm sure
that he would be

256
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:01,625
one hundred percent
honest with me.

257
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:04,416
Your daughter Maya just pointed
out to us to be very careful

258
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,125
about what we're saying
and thinking about Kazuki,

259
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:09,958
without knowing his
point of view or feelings.

260
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:14,875
Not so long ago, someone else
said the exact same thing.

261
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:17,583
Wasn't it Akane,
who questioned why we

262
00:12:17,666 --> 00:12:20,666
didn't try to understand
Festum's feelings?

263
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:23,333
It was so important to her.

264
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:24,708
She's the reason that I decided

265
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:27,083
to continue doing my
current research.

266
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:28,750
I'm still not entirely clear on

267
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:31,500
what her theory was
trying to show us.

268
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:33,500
Whether or not we
should tell that to Kazuki,

269
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:35,541
is a whole 'nother story.

270
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:39,125
All I know is that there is one
thing I will continue to do,

271
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:41,250
pray for his return.

272
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:44,000
And for Akane's peace as well...

273
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:46,958
Thank you for that.

274
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:50,166
I can't believe it.

275
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:52,166
The power level is going
through the roof just by

276
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:55,208
putting in the system core
of the Nothung Model.

277
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:56,958
What is this machine?

278
00:12:57,041 --> 00:13:00,708
It is the Salvator Model,
Mitsuhiro and I created it.

279
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:02,625
It is the true
savior of our world.

280
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:04,375
The only problem
we have is whether

281
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:06,125
or not there is
someone who can pilot it.

282
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:08,666
Wasn't this unit designed
specifically for your son?

283
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:11,041
His brain has already
developed beyond the point

284
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:13,166
where he can
safely meld with it.

285
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,583
And soon he won't
be able to pilot Fafner.

286
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:16,916
Doctor.

287
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I need to get your
signature on the application.

288
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:20,416
Wow that was quick.

289
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,250
I guess that thanks
to Nothung Model,

290
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:24,750
the upper management
is in a good mood.

291
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:27,958
All right then, you can meet
with your son tomorrow.

292
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:29,541
We have decided,

293
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:32,041
I should not come into contact
with Mir other than ourselves.

294
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:32,958
What?

295
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:34,375
And why's that?

296
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:38,458
The preferred divergence
has initialized it's action.

297
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:46,958
We have decided
that we have learned

298
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:49,958
all that there is for us to
learn from this place.

299
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,166
What's going on?

300
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:09,458
Moldova Control.

301
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:11,458
I have visual contact
with an incredible

302
00:14:11,541 --> 00:14:13,958
number of
Arfenotheles-type Festum.

303
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:16,375
And they are headed
directly for the base!

304
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:18,208
Maybe our minds have been read.

305
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:19,958
There could quite
possibly be Festum

306
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:22,458
here among us in the
underground base.

307
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:24,458
We need to get out
of here immediately.

308
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:26,291
Even if we lose here,
our telling the world

309
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:28,750
about the new fighter has
raised the human race's

310
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:31,000
spirit enough
to continue the fight.

311
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:32,000
I hope you're right.

312
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:33,291
Now hurry.

313
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:40,208
All stations,
prepare for the Festum attack.

314
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:43,750
Your door will now be unlocked.

315
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:47,625
A large number of
Festum Arfenotheles-type,

316
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:49,250
and Grendel-type have landed.

317
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:51,375
All pilots of
Fafner Gnosis Model,

318
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:54,333
please report to hanger
thirty-hour immediately.

319
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:55,666
We have determined that we will

320
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:58,333
not let me meet
with Kazuki Makabe.

321
00:14:58,416 --> 00:14:59,625
But why?

322
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:01,125
What reason could
there be for your Mir to be

323
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:03,041
denied access to our Mir?

324
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:04,333
We do not acknowledge the

325
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:06,375
concept of denial
or affirmation.

326
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:08,750
We have discovered that by
simplifying the universe 

327
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:12,250
to nothingness we are able to
live on a higher dimension.

328
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:14,083
We have decided
that it is best that we

329
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:16,291
do not have any
more human co mingling.

330
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:17,708
Then that's it.

331
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:19,583
Why don't we
at least go and watch

332
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:21,083
the core's progress together.

333
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:23,791
We do not have a concept
of what you call progress.

334
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:26,375
If you allow me to,
I will teach you about it.

335
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:28,000
That will be the
first step in learning

336
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:30,833
what Akane Makabe
was trying to achieve.

337
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:37,375
Why can't you prevent
them from getting inside?

338
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:39,875
The defense system in
every sector has gone offline!

339
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:41,416
That's ridiculous!

340
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:55,166
Fazolt company is gone sir.

341
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,916
And the Grendel-type
have invaded level three.

342
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:02,833
There are battles everywhere...
there is nothing else.

343
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:05,208
Soshi...

344
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:08,375
This island was
the only paradise.

345
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:10,750
If I could...

346
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:12,750
I would have gone.

347
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,625
Soshi...!!

348
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:26,500
Get a move on, we have to
get this stuff fixed right away!

349
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:28,208
The enemy is already inside!

350
00:16:28,291 --> 00:16:29,541
Hey, is there anyone down there

351
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:30,916
who can work on
one of these things?

352
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:31,916
I'll be right there!

353
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,083
Huh?

354
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:34,291
Hey, are you sure
you can pilot this?

355
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:35,541
Yes!

356
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:39,791
All right, I know I can do this!

357
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:44,125
Where is the data we collected
on the Nothung Model?

358
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:45,750
It's already on its
way north with

359
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:48,041
a defense team from
the base protecting it.

360
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:49,458
That's where the
real battleground

361
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:51,666
is going to be eventually.

362
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:53,541
But before that,
there is one more thing

363
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:54,958
that we need to attend to.

364
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:56,333
You mean Alvis...

365
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:57,958
I wonder if they will hand over

366
00:16:58,041 --> 00:16:59,958
the rest of the
Nothung Model to us.

367
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:02,541
We are going to have
to persuade them to do so...

368
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:04,791
We're just going to have to
make them understand that there

369
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:06,458
is no future for the
human race if they

370
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:08,958
don't choose to fight
along with us.

371
00:17:17,916 --> 00:17:19,291
Where's this video from?

372
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:22,041
Impossible, we're receiving
this video feed live.

373
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:23,666
But how is that even possible?

374
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,875
Put the image up
on the main monitor!

375
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:29,833
It's the Neo U.N.
base at Moldova!

376
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:32,500
There's no way to
get a video from there...

377
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:33,875
I've finished the analysis.

378
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:35,791
The signal is being
delivered by satellite.

379
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:37,291
No way, that's impossible!

380
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:39,458
He's right about that, there
aren't any satellites left,

381
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:41,666
at least not any that
humans have access to.

382
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,708
Besides, showing that kind
of stuff would cause everyone

383
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:45,833
in the world to lose
whatever hope they had left.

384
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:48,166
Probably exactly what
the enemy had in mind.

385
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:51,416
You think that Festum is
transmitting this image to us?

386
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:53,833
It certainly is unprecedented,

387
00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:56,583
...but it could be their way of
breaking our world's spirit.

388
00:17:56,666 --> 00:17:57,791
That's ridiculous.

389
00:17:57,875 --> 00:17:59,375
Are you trying to say
that they understand

390
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:01,375
our feelings all of a sudden?

391
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:02,875
Humph...

392
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:04,125
Hey look at that,

393
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:05,500
there's one that seems
to be holding its own.

394
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:06,958
It's Kazuki!

395
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:08,458
Kazuki?!

396
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:09,958
You mean...

397
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:11,583
Kazuki is piloting that Fafner?

398
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:13,041
There's no doubt about it.

399
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:14,708
The movement's
definitely Kazuki's.

400
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:17,083
Then, we need to go
and help him right now!

401
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:20,041
There is no guarantee that that
he's piloting that machine.

402
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:22,208
Soshi you know
that's Kazuki don't you?

403
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:23,375
We have to go and help him.

404
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:24,833
We can't just leave him there!!

405
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:26,333
Calm down, Maya!

406
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:28,791
Soshi, you've got to
be able to do something?

407
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:29,958
Tell me you can!!

408
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:32,416
Maya you're getting
hysterical, stop it!

409
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,125
I'm afraid it's impossible to

410
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:36,416
send Fafner to a
place like that.

411
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:39,375
Well if no one else
is going, then I will!

412
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:44,416
I've got to try and help him...
for Shoko's honor at least...

413
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:46,458
Maya...

414
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:49,666
Shoko wouldn't be stopped.

415
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:52,958
And she didn't fight
only for Kazuki you know,

416
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:55,458
she fought for everyone...

417
00:18:55,916 --> 00:18:58,583
Give me one good reason
why I can't go and try?!

418
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:00,291
Because we can't
expose the island

419
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:03,125
to that much danger
for any one person!

420
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:09,375
You can't maybe ...

421
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:13,583
Oh, come to think of it, I've
been working nonstop

422
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:16,416
for a while, I've got alot
of vacation days to use.

423
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,625
I think I'll go put myself
on third level standby .

424
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:21,916
Wait a second.
Where are you going!

425
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:25,291
I'm going to stretch
my wings a little bit...

426
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:27,958
I hear that Moldova
is very nice.

427
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:29,416
Mr. Mizoguchi...

428
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,916
Do you really think that I'm
going to authorize that?!

429
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,708
I already have received
authorization on this one,

430
00:19:34,791 --> 00:19:36,666
a direct order from
your ex-superior.

431
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,291
And what order was that?

432
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:41,875
To protect you and Kazuki,
no matter what the cost...

433
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:44,208
Akane Makabe,
of the second battalion

434
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:46,458
defense force,
gave me that order.

435
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:49,166
And its one that
I intend to keep.

436
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:51,000
You would do that?

437
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:52,958
You'd risk your life?

438
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:54,375
Hey, miss! If you're
not doing anything,

439
00:19:54,458 --> 00:19:55,458
come keep me company!

440
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:56,291
Kyosuke!

441
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:57,458
Mr. Mizoguchi... No!

442
00:19:57,541 --> 00:19:59,041
I'm with you!

443
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:00,541
But Maya...

444
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:02,541
Let's get going!

445
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:04,125
I'm ready!

446
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:08,208
We have decided to abandon
Moldova Colonel Barns.

447
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:09,958
It is time for you
to carry out the rest of

448
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:11,666
the operation as
we have discussed.

449
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:12,791
Roger that sir.

450
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:14,458
We're now headed for API-1

451
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:16,375
to initiate Operation
Alvis capture,

452
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:18,333
and the securing
of Tatsumiya Island.

453
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:21,625
Gaining control of the island's
core is our first priority.

454
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:24,916
So their commander is Makabe.

455
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,666
This should be good!

456
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,500
Now listen up.

457
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:30,166
We are in the
process of carrying out

458
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:33,416
Operation Alvis. You need
to make yourself useful.

459
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,375
I am well aware of that.

460
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:39,291
Maya, please I'm
begging you don't do this.

461
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:41,583
Why do you have to go?
It doesn't make any sense!

462
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:42,833
I have to.

463
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:45,208
I haven't been able
to do anything to help.

464
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:46,875
That's why I understand.

465
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:48,666
Understand...?

466
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,166
Understand Shoko's feelings.

467
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:54,666
Maya...

468
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:58,625
She couldn't even go to school.

469
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:00,750
She couldn't do anything...

470
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:02,916
She could only watch...

471
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:05,708
Now I understand.

472
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:07,750
That's why...

473
00:21:08,458 --> 00:21:11,250
Please let me do this,
for Shoko.

474
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:15,041
It's gonna be all right.

475
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:17,125
I'm just going
to bring back Kazuki.

476
00:21:17,208 --> 00:21:19,041
I'll be back here in no time.

477
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:21,291
I promise you that.

478
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:23,916
Soshi please prominse
me something.

479
00:21:24,541 --> 00:21:26,500
Promise me that
you'll talk to Kazuki

480
00:21:26,583 --> 00:21:28,875
for sure when we come back.

481
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:30,416
Well I...

482
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:32,000
Let's go.

483
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:34,208
You can finish this
discussion when we return.

484
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:35,916
By the way, Is there
anything that you want me

485
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,416
to tell Kazuki for you
when I see him?

486
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:40,916
Then, I'll tell him
that you're eating meals

487
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,583
at my shop everyday
because he's not

488
00:21:42,666 --> 00:21:44,083
here to keep you out of trouble.

489
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:45,375
How's that sound?

490
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:46,916
Well then shall we go Miss?

491
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Lets.

492
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,625
Akane Makabe is...

493
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:06,625
Kazuki Makabe's...
mother, is that right?

494
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:08,000
That's right.

495
00:22:09,541 --> 00:22:11,250
To pass on the part of her
will that still exists in you.

496
00:22:11,333 --> 00:22:14,833
You will have to give this
machine over to Kazuki.

497
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:17,375
So Mr. Mizoguchi,
what's the real reason

498
00:22:17,458 --> 00:22:19,166
that you wanted
to take me with you?

499
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:22,666
'cause I think Kazuki
will be happy to see you too

500
00:22:25,416 --> 00:22:28,333
I'm not the one
who he wants to see ...

501
00:22:29,708 --> 00:22:32,291
I'm sure of that...

502
00:22:32,708 --> 00:22:37,666
♪ closing song ♪

503
00:23:36,416 --> 00:23:37,875
They will attack...

504
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:40,750
A girl will realize...

505
00:23:42,708 --> 00:23:44,750
Hope will be re awakened...

506
00:23:46,333 --> 00:23:48,416
I am not the one...

507
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,500
...who he wants to see...

508
00:23:50,583 --> 00:23:52,583
I'm sure of that...

509
00:23:53,375 --> 00:23:57,250
Next on Fafner:
Episode Number 14.

510
00:23:57,333 --> 00:23:59,416

511
00:24:01,125 --> 00:24:02,750
Are you there?
