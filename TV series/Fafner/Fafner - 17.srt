00:01:44,625 --> 00:01:46,000
It seems that
Kazuki's coming back

3
00:01:46,083 --> 00:01:48,375
as quickly as he
left us, doesn't it?

4
00:01:48,791 --> 00:01:50,958
We've just received
authorization to land.

5
00:01:51,041 --> 00:01:51,916
Look at that.

6
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,125
Not a single enemy to be found.

7
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,583
Kazuki...

8
00:01:55,666 --> 00:01:57,083
He did it, didn't he?

9
00:01:57,166 --> 00:01:59,041
Even though he was so worn out.

10
00:01:59,125 --> 00:02:01,208
One can do of a
lot for love, right?

11
00:02:01,291 --> 00:02:04,166
In other words, thanks to you,
our island is now safe.

12
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:05,208
Not really.

13
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:07,666
Like always I wasn't
very much help.

14
00:02:08,625 --> 00:02:10,625
No need to be so humble.

15
00:02:11,791 --> 00:02:14,375
You took off with a
primary military apparatus,

16
00:02:14,458 --> 00:02:17,375
leaking this island's
secret to the world.

17
00:02:17,458 --> 00:02:20,291
With the consensus of Alvis,
you could be deported.

18
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:23,833
You will remain here until they
determine your punishment.

19
00:02:25,416 --> 00:02:28,666
Mr. Mizoguchi told
me all about Mom.

20
00:02:29,708 --> 00:02:31,250
You should know Dad.

21
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:33,375
It wasn't your fault.

22
00:02:33,458 --> 00:02:35,541
Apologize when
you pay respects to her.

23
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:38,708
Don't ever leave without
saying anything again.

24
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:41,750
How you can lock your own son up

25
00:02:41,833 --> 00:02:44,125
in a mental ward
like that is beyond me.

26
00:02:44,208 --> 00:02:46,833
It was Dr. Tohmi's
recommendation.

27
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:48,208
So the kid was a bit impulsive.

28
00:02:48,291 --> 00:02:50,291
It doesn't mean
he's off his rocker.

29
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:53,041
Um... What's going to
happen to Kazuki now?

30
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:54,541
Don't you worry about it.

31
00:02:54,625 --> 00:02:57,291
By the way, don't you have
something to give to this guy?

32
00:02:57,375 --> 00:02:58,416
Oh...

33
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,875
Mr. Yoji Hino wanted
you to have this.

34
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:03,541
And Yoji?

35
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:05,208
I'm afraid that he's gone...

36
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:08,041
He's gone a along
with all those Festum.

37
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:09,583
I see...

38
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:12,375
You've really been
a great help to us, Maya.

39
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:13,750
And I thank you.

40
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:14,375
No...

41
00:03:14,458 --> 00:03:16,291
I...

42
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:27,708
Hello Soshi.

43
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:29,833
How do you do?

44
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:32,583
I had a hard time
putting on these clothes.

45
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:35,833
And I still can't move
my arms very will in them yet.

46
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:43,458
I got out of the Coagula.
Do you want to know why?

47
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:45,875
If that is your "will"
then I will respect that.

48
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:48,166
I'll do whatever
I can to support you.

49
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,666
Not will...

50
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:50,625
Actually...

51
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:52,333
it's my dream.

52
00:03:52,416 --> 00:03:53,625
Your dream?

53
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:56,041
I wanted to see the
world with my own eyes,

54
00:03:56,125 --> 00:03:58,083
and touch it with
my own two hands...

55
00:03:58,166 --> 00:04:00,916
And now my dream
has finally come true.

56
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,416
Just tell me what
you want and I will

57
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,291
do everything thing that I can.

58
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:07,250
I want to live with
everyone else in the family.

59
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:09,750
There's no need to worry.

60
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,500
It's just a selfish
wish of mine.

61
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:13,125
Feel free to act
like a big brother

62
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:15,166
and tell me that
it's just not possible.

63
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,916
I don't mind at all.

64
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,291
Right.

65
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:21,166
It's called synchronicity.

66
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,500
Anytime we humans
acquire a new technology,

67
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:26,666
the Festum assimilate the
information to use against us.

68
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,833
We know that the
enemy is getting stronger.

69
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:31,500
But do we know for a fact that
it's all because of the island?

70
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:33,500
The Festom are using
Tatsumiya Island as a

71
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:35,833
conduit to the
human race's powers.

72
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:37,125
All right.

73
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:38,500
Well then why can't
we just use the island to

74
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:40,833
detect the enemy's
power as well?

75
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:44,125
You don't have any intention
of giving up the island do you?

76
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:45,166
Of course not.

77
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:46,541
And what is
your intention, Barnes?

78
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:48,166
This submarine
is scheduled to leave

79
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:49,375
the island tomorrow morning.

80
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:51,541
However the other one
will be staying.

81
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:52,625
What for?

82
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:54,041
Are you going to
use the sub as a shield?

83
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:56,208
I guarantee we
won't launch an attack.

84
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:58,875
I'm sorry but I
just can't trust you.

85
00:04:58,958 --> 00:04:59,875
Hmph.

86
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:01,708
This conversation is over.

87
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:03,708
We will return both
of them to you unharmed.

88
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:05,416
That's a promise.

89
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:10,208
Don't you realize
that all you're

90
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:12,625
doing is putting
yourself in danger?

91
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,791
How are you?

92
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:18,791
It's been a long time.

93
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:20,208
This is quite a surprise...

94
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:21,583
Good to see you, Michio.

95
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:24,625
If you don't mind...
I'd like to ask you something.

96
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:25,833
What is it?

97
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:27,291
Your new Fafner model...

98
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:30,375
Would you mind telling me
who was piloting it earlier?

99
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:32,458
It was Kazuki.

100
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:33,833
You mean that kid?

101
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:35,541
So then you know who he is?

102
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:36,791
I know that he's a coward.

103
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:39,000
He called off
an attack mid-battle.

104
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:40,708
Called off an attack?

105
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:42,500
He did that?

106
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:43,583
I see...

107
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:45,791
Well then I must
remember to praise him.

108
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:49,083
Soshi.

109
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:50,916
Hello Maya.
How do you do?

110
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,416
Huh?

111
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,125
Hey, is Chizuru inside?

112
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:57,291
Goodbye Soshi.

113
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,125
See you later.

114
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:02,666
Who is that girl?

115
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:06,083
Tsubaki Minashiro...
and she happens to be my sister.

116
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:07,708
You have a sister?

117
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:09,208
I never knew.

118
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:10,958
Due to personal reasons she was

119
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:12,833
being kept at
a special facility.

120
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:14,541
Oh I see.

121
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:18,041
Hey, did you ever get
a chance to talk to Kazuki?

122
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:19,833
That has nothing to do with you.

123
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:21,791
But you promised me
you would, remember?

124
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:23,125
You're not a pilot, okay?

125
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:25,291
So just keep
your nose out of this!

126
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:28,291
I already know that...

127
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:30,500
I haven't forgotten.

128
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:31,750
It's just...

129
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:34,791
I really want everyone
to get along that's all.

130
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:36,875
Every single
time someone's gone,

131
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:39,125
we always end up fighting...

132
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:45,958
Please Soshi, will you
try and talk to Kazuki for me?

133
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:57,708
Oh, Soshi.

134
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:02,041
This here is my room.
Come in.

135
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:03,333
So then...

136
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:05,333
Does this mean that
you live inside of Alvis?

137
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:08,000
It makes going on
missions more convenient.

138
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:10,416
You can sit if you want.

139
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:15,833
Now.
Why don't we talk.

140
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:18,083
What did you want to talk about?

141
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,541
It's so empty.

142
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:22,375
This room doesn't
have anything in it.

143
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:23,291
No, look!

144
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:25,041
I have a bed over there.

145
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:27,125
I have a table and a sofa.

146
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:28,500
I also have a desk too.

147
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:30,833
And then there's that
picture hanging on the wall.

148
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:33,791
Is that...
your only picture?

149
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:34,958
And look.

150
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:37,750
I have my very own
small private bathroom.

151
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:41,333
Soshi. Are you
sick or something?

152
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:42,958
Don't touch anything!

153
00:07:43,916 --> 00:07:45,083
These are pills I take.

154
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:46,750
They're to suppress flashbacks.

155
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:48,625
What kind of flashbacks?

156
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:52,208
Once in a while after the
battles have already ended...

157
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:53,416
I can still feel the pain that

158
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,541
you pilots felt while
you were fighting.

159
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:58,625
So these...
are like painkillers.

160
00:07:58,708 --> 00:08:00,000
Soshi.

161
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:02,916
Wait! I haven't finished
showing you everything yet!

162
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:05,333
This is the vending machine.

163
00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:08,708
It's located approximately 11
steps from the front of my room.

164
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:10,708
So it's very convenient.

165
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:12,291
You know something?

166
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:14,458
You're a bit strange,
aren't you?

167
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:21,916
I'm the only one...
missing from here.

168
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:25,083
I was the one
who took this picture...

169
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:28,041
So I guess it make sense.

170
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:32,125
If I were in this?

171
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:34,625
Where would I belong?

172
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,666
I'm surprised that you
came here to talk to me.

173
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:43,041
I'm actually here to complain.

174
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:45,375
Is this about locking
you up in that room?

175
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:47,166
Or could it be about
me leaving the island

176
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:48,500
back then without so much as

177
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:50,291
saying a word
to you before I left?

178
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:52,791
You having a reunion
that I can join?

179
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:54,083
What are you doing here?

180
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:56,125
Out of all those kids
who were our classmates?

181
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:58,666
How many of them
can you remember?

182
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,583
Because of all
the gene assimilation

183
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:03,416
all of them died. One by one...

184
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,791
And in the end the only ones

185
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:07,166
who are still alive
are the three of us.

186
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:10,625
After all, we were nothing
more than a few guinea pigs.

187
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:12,125
They needed to use us in order

188
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:14,208
to preserve their
future generations.

189
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:15,750
But I still don't
understand what this

190
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:17,458
has to do with Neo U.N.

191
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:19,333
The more a person pilots Fafner,

192
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:21,083
the more their
chromosomes mutate,

193
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:23,208
bringing them
ever closer to death.

194
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:24,875
Though it's possible
for the mutation

195
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:27,291
to increase one's
lifespan as well.

196
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:29,458
Or at least that's
what Dad told me.

197
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:32,000
But in the end,
his research was useless.

198
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:33,416
Hold on a minute.

199
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,208
So then how come you...?

200
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:37,333
Long ago,
I once knew a girl who's

201
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:39,875
dream was to
become an singing idol.

202
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:43,125
But I just couldn't bear
the thought of her growing sick,

203
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:45,375
I really wanted to save her.

204
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,458
Before I knew it,
I was fighting,

205
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:49,833
far away from the island.

206
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:55,250
If you want me to,
I can let you out of here.

207
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:56,625
It's okay...

208
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:58,750
...don't worry about it,
my Dad told me to stay here.

209
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:00,291
Oh, I see.

210
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:01,333
Hey.

211
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:03,041
Thanks for the drink.

212
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:04,666
Yeah

213
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,166
I'll see you then.

214
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:07,500
Oh, right.

215
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:09,166
Goodnight Soshi.

216
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:15,041
I see...

217
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:16,916
So I have three
months at the most...

218
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,916
I don't see that as a bad thing.

219
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,458
I'll be glad to live that long.

220
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:23,083
Oh Tsubaki...

221
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:25,833
I made the decision that
I wanted to live my own life...

222
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:29,000
I know it means that
someday it'll come to an end.

223
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:30,750
If I had chosen the same path as

224
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:32,791
the Festum things
would be different...

225
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:34,875
I wouldn't have
even wanted to be alive.

226
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:37,583
At least that's how
I would've felt.

227
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:42,791
Your body feels so warm.

228
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:44,833
it's really nice.

229
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:51,041
I could care less
for the island that

230
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:53,375
created me to
be their guinea pig.

231
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:55,125
It doesn't matter, does it?

232
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:56,916
If you're one of
the lucky ones, you die.

233
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,250
And if not, you
have to deal with surviving.

234
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:01,166
No...
that's backwards.

235
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:03,375
Everything becomes
backwards eventually.

236
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:05,166
That's just how it is.

237
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:06,750
Yeah?

238
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:10,750
Well, then I guess that island
must have some luck on its side.

239
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:12,541
Triple Six!

240
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:14,250
What is it?

241
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:15,500
I wanted to let
you know that I am

242
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,750
going to be
staying on the island.

243
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:18,875
I have no choice then.

244
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:20,458
It looks like I'll
be staying here too.

245
00:11:20,541 --> 00:11:21,416
No, you can't!

246
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,916
Huh?

247
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,500
You're leaving... In fact
you're shipping out tomorrow.

248
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:27,250
Those are the Colonel's orders.

249
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:28,541
Yeah yeah.

250
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:32,041
If I hafta go,
it's better to do it asap.

251
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:50,333
This new model is the product of
Mitsuhiro and Yoji's research.

252
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:52,458
Those two must
have created this Fafner

253
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:54,750
to battle against the
MIR of the North Pole.

254
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:57,666
Kozo Minashiro was
preparing for that as well.

255
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,833
But we were attacked
by Festum before we

256
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:02,291
were fully prepared
to fight against them.

257
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:04,333
Has it really been
seven years already?

258
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:06,041
That's how long it's
been since the children

259
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:07,625
received the message
from the enemy?

260
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:10,958
And are these Fafner to be our
weapons in the final battle?

261
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:13,458
I've spent time with Tsubaki
Minashiro and she speaks

262
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:15,583
as if she and the machine
are one and the same.

263
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:16,416
What?

264
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,125
Tsubaki Minashiro...

265
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:20,208
Does that mean
she's gained free will?

266
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:21,583
Yes and she still maintains the

267
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:23,500
ability to control
the whole island.

268
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:25,208
What do you mean
when you say that she

269
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:27,375
and the machine
are one and the same?

270
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:28,791
Even when it was assimilated,

271
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:31,291
Mark Sein remained
as its own entity.

272
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:33,833
Just like Tsubaki Minashiro
who's still the core

273
00:12:33,916 --> 00:12:36,500
of the island yet
human at the same time.

274
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:38,416
But how could
a Fafner just suddenly

275
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,416
start assimilating
things like that?

276
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,333
Because the entire
thing melted away.

277
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:44,250
I guess it changed
into something different.

278
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:47,958
This is simply unheard of, the
spontaneous rebirth of the core.

279
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:49,666
Dr. Nishio.

280
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,541
Do a complete diagnostic.

281
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:53,000
Understood.

282
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:56,041
It's like having a
whole new CDC isn't it.

283
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:59,000
It's a parallel all-in-one room
called Arthur's Room.

284
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:01,583
Believe it or not, this
place was actually built first.

285
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:03,416
Since it has
everything in one place,

286
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,250
it was too big of a
load on our systems,

287
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:07,666
which is why we
never used it before.

288
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,458
But now that the
core's walking around,

289
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:11,166
we're able to
use the system to link

290
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,250
and intercept as
many things as we want.

291
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:15,208
Then that means
this is even more effective

292
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:17,625
than our old CDC, doesn't it?

293
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:19,791
Good morning.

294
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:21,333
--Good morning to you sir.
--Good morning to you sir.

295
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:22,750
Status report.

296
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:25,375
The Neo U.N. vessel
Midlight is heading northwest.

297
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:27,833
There's been no
suspicious activity thus far.

298
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:31,375
The vessel should be exiting the
Number One Welle shield shortly.

299
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:41,291
So it's a mirrored
camouflage system.

300
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:43,208
To the only home I ever knew.

301
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:44,333
Farewell.

302
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:46,416
And soon it will
disappear for good...

303
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,958
...and everything else
along with it,

304
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:50,291
including that girl Kanon.

305
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:52,333
I've begun executing the plan.

306
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:54,708
Protect the ship until
the explosion goes off.

307
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:56,291
Roger that.

308
00:13:57,625 --> 00:13:59,041
It's finally time...

309
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:01,458
My chance to truly disappear.

310
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:04,000
They'll sacrifice the
crew just to blow them up?

311
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:05,416
Are you serious?

312
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:08,000
The Colonel plans to use
Fenrir and strategic missiles.

313
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:09,791
He's serious about
wiping out the island.

314
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:10,875
Why now?

315
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:12,333
And how long have you...?

316
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:14,375
If you take off to
try and save them.

317
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:16,083
I'm sure that the
Colonel won't hesitate

318
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:18,583
to attack Megaselion as well.

319
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:20,416
But I've set up a little device.

320
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,833
To make sure that won't happen.

321
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:31,791
I am no longer a
member of the Neo U.N.!

322
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:36,708
Megaselion has launched
without authorization!

323
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:39,083
He did come
from the island after all...

324
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:41,416
We'll just let him
join his father then.

325
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,416
There's something wrong with
the weapon control system.

326
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,583
We can't fire!

327
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:45,500
How could that be?

328
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:46,916
Sorry boys.

329
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,250
But information systems are
my specialty you know.

330
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:51,958
Alvis!
Come in, Alvis!

331
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:53,208
This is Megaselion.

332
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:54,208
It's Hino!

333
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:57,000
Sir, its Michio.

334
00:14:57,416 --> 00:14:58,833
The island is in danger!

335
00:14:58,916 --> 00:15:01,500
The remaining submarine is
going to use Fenrir to attack.

336
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:02,750
What?
Are you sure?

337
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:04,666
Did you hear what
he just said, Kyosuke?

338
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,208
And can you confirm any of it?

339
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:08,208
Your suspicions are correct.

340
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:11,541
The Fenrir warning system
has been completely destroyed.

341
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:13,625
It's safe to say
that no one in the

342
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:15,500
crew knew anything
about it either.

343
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:17,875
I'll see what I
can do from here.

344
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:19,708
They've figured us out.

345
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:21,625
Sacrificing their own
so that they can blow

346
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:25,083
all of us up is just plain
old tacky if you ask me.

347
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:31,833
Fenrir control has been switched

348
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:35,000
over to the
machine I.D.ed J-O17.

349
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:36,125
Damnit!

350
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:37,333
Fumihiko.

351
00:15:37,416 --> 00:15:40,250
An enemy Fafner
has taken control of Fenrir.

352
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:41,000
Kazuki!

353
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:42,416
We need you to fight.

354
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,333
Launch an attack
in the Mark Sein.

355
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:46,541
We could contact
the Belicur for assistance.

356
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:48,583
They're currently
deployed in the Pacific.

357
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:49,750
Do it!

358
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:51,166
On behalf of the future
of the human race,

359
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,458
I want that island destroyed!

360
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:58,416
Their guided missiles are
headed straight for the island.

361
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,625
Impact in ten minutes.

362
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:00,708
The Welle Shield is almost...

363
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:02,041
No!
Don't close the shield!

364
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:03,958
If that submarine explodes
within our barrier,

365
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:06,041
it'll take the island with it.

366
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:07,166
You work on that sub.

367
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:08,541
I'll take care of the missiles.

368
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:09,833
What?

369
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:11,375
Canon is honest at heart...

370
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:14,250
Please, give her a chance
to change her mind.

371
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:16,583
Don't worry, I will.

372
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:19,125
Canon!

373
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:21,125
I need to talk to you.

374
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:22,375
About what.

375
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:23,750
Huh?
Oh uh...

376
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:25,541
I just wanted to
ask you something.

377
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:27,291
What do you mean by "something"?

378
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:28,541
Well uh...

379
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:30,541
I was wondering...
where is it you come from?

380
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:32,083
Moldova base.

381
00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:34,375
No, uh, that isn't what I meant.

382
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:36,458
What I meant was,
where's your hometown?

383
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:39,750
It was a place called Dublin
until about four years ago.

384
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:41,500
But it no longer exists.

385
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:42,416
Dublin?

386
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,333
Let's see...

387
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:44,500
That was in Germany, right?

388
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:46,000
No it was in Ireland...

389
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:47,625
Is this your way
of making fun of me?

390
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:48,708
No, not at all.

391
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:50,708
I'm not making fun.
I swear!

392
00:16:51,416 --> 00:16:52,833
Our little talk is over.

393
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:54,291
No!
Please wait.

394
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:56,750
Um...
what about your family?

395
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:58,375
I used to have one.

396
00:16:58,458 --> 00:17:00,500
They don't exist anymore.

397
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:02,291
What about your friends?

398
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:05,458
I don't have any, the
festum assimilated them.

399
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:07,833
One last thing.

400
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:09,125
Why are you doing this?

401
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:10,000
No reason.

402
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:11,708
I'm just following orders.

403
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:13,208
An order?

404
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:15,708
You're telling me you didn't
have a choice in the matter?

405
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:17,666
Does that mean
you'll do anything

406
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,000
as long as you are ordered to?

407
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:20,166
That's right.

408
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:21,791
Will you listen to yourself?

409
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:23,916
It's like you've
lost your own identity.

410
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,250
I was like you.

411
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:26,875
But now I don't exist either.

412
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:28,291
You're simply the worst.

413
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:29,291
You know that?

414
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:30,625
What does that mean?

415
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:32,458
Look at the island.

416
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:34,541
A lot of people live there.

417
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:35,958
And not only that,

418
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:38,458
so many of them
mean a great deal to me.

419
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:40,291
That doesn't have
anything to do with me!

420
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:41,291
Of course it doesn't!

421
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:43,583
Because they don't exist to you.

422
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:45,375
And the reason for that is...

423
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:47,958
Because you
don't think you exist.

424
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:49,958
When you were
given this order...

425
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:52,166
...you were grateful,
you were relieved, weren't you?

426
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:55,125
Cuz... You're incapable of
making your own decisions!

427
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:57,375
You've been waiting so
long for this order.

428
00:17:57,458 --> 00:18:01,000
Because all this time,
you've wanted disappear, right?

429
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,458
Is that Michio in there?

430
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:08,333
Hey thats...

431
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:10,500
That you, Triple Six?

432
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:12,250
Damn!

433
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:14,375
Can I not make this
thing fly any faster?

434
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:21,458
Thanks for the assist, guys.

435
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:23,666
Why are you
doing this, Triple Six?

436
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,125
Who gave you the order.

437
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:27,500
You don't understand
at all, do you?!

438
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:28,666
Huh?

439
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,166
Don't come closer!

440
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:33,666
When I'm this far from you...

441
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,875
I can't even see your face!

442
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:37,333
You're not lost.

443
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:39,750
You're still
inside there, aren't you?

444
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:41,791
I'll give you three minutes.

445
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:44,916
If you want to turn that
switch on, then go right ahead!

446
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,375
Kazuki!
What is this?

447
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,208
Do you know
something that we don't?

448
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:51,166
If you can't make your
decision after three minutes...

449
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:55,208
Then I'll make
you disappear.

450
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:57,666
I don't understand.
What do you mean?

451
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:58,666
I'll disappear?

452
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:00,083
Don't do it!

453
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:02,375
Fafner won't be able to contain
all of Fenrir's energy.

454
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:04,208
She can't do it.

455
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:06,125
She can't make a decision.

456
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:07,208
What?

457
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:09,791
The RV's are reentering
the atmosphere!

458
00:19:12,041 --> 00:19:13,500
What is it you're trying to do?

459
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:15,416
I could just hit that
switch any time I want.

460
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,750
If that's your decision,
then do it...

461
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:19,458
And I'll disappear with you.

462
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:20,583
Until then...

463
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:21,708
We have time.

464
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:22,708
We can talk.

465
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:24,083
You want to talk?

466
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:25,916
What should we talk about?

467
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,583
Why are you asking me that.

468
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:28,958
Canon...

469
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:29,875
You're name.

470
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:30,916
What about that?

471
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,583
What does Canon mean?

472
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:33,625
Well...

473
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:35,416
It's a type of
musical composition.

474
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,583
Really?
What kind?

475
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,125
It's a melody...
that's born gradually...

476
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:42,708
...through repetition...

477
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:44,583
That's what I
was told at least...

478
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:46,583
By my mom.

479
00:19:46,666 --> 00:19:48,250
What do you want from me?

480
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:51,208
What exactly do
you expect me to do here?

481
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:53,166
Make your own decision, Canon!

482
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:54,541
You can do it!

483
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:56,375
You want me to...

484
00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:58,458
...make a decision?

485
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:01,166
Here they come!

486
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:08,625
Damn you!

487
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,041
Ten seconds left!

488
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:12,458
You have to make your decision!

489
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:13,750
Do you hear me?

490
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:14,750
I...

491
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:15,958
It's just...

492
00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:17,708
I don't know...

493
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:21,041
You're there!
You exist!

494
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:22,416
Now choose it!

495
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,041
Canon!

496
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:42,375
Why'd I...?

497
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:47,583
I did it.

498
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:49,458
The Fenrir control systems.

499
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:51,000
I turned them off.

500
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,416
But why?

501
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,666
It's your fault!

502
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,250
You said you were going
to make me disappear!

503
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:57,791
You liar!
Why didn't you do it!

504
00:20:58,125 --> 00:21:00,500
It was only if you
didn't make a decision.

505
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:02,083
You remember?

506
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:03,875
But you did it.

507
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:05,916
You made an own choice.

508
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:07,791
Wait.
Don't go.

509
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:09,791
You actually listened to me.

510
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:11,416
You listened to me.

511
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,041
You listened to my story.

512
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:38,041
Why...
did you come back?

513
00:21:38,125 --> 00:21:42,041
I've wanted to come back...
for a long time now.

514
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:43,250
You know something...

515
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:44,791
I've fought against
just about everything,

516
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:46,375
not to mention Festum.

517
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:48,500
I've fought men.

518
00:21:48,583 --> 00:21:51,791
Some of them were even
the exact same age as me...

519
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:53,583
And each and every time...

520
00:21:53,666 --> 00:21:55,083
I've wanted to come back.

521
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:57,791
But somehow I
just couldn't do it.

522
00:21:58,583 --> 00:21:59,708
You idiot!

523
00:21:59,791 --> 00:22:01,458
Why couldn't you just
swallow your pride?!

524
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:02,875
You'd been gone for so long.

525
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:05,041
You should've come back sooner.

526
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,708
You're such an idiot!

527
00:22:10,375 --> 00:22:11,583
We really ought
to be taking her into

528
00:22:11,666 --> 00:22:13,833
custody now, but it's your call.

529
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:16,166
I think she needs
some time to herself.

530
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:18,833
I knew you were gonna say that.

531
00:22:33,083 --> 00:22:38,041
♪ closing song ♪

532
00:23:39,833 --> 00:23:42,041
Life goes back to normal.

533
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:47,416
Splashing in waves...
and friends smiling...

534
00:23:48,083 --> 00:23:50,083
And the return
of my father brings

535
00:23:50,166 --> 00:23:52,416
about something unexpected.

536
00:23:53,041 --> 00:23:57,500
Next on "Fafner"
episode number eighteen.

537
00:23:57,583 --> 00:23:59,041
"Memory."

538
00:24:00,083 --> 00:24:01,958
Are you there?
