00:01:45,666 --> 00:01:47,625
Attention all residents.

3
00:01:47,708 --> 00:01:49,041
Every one of the facilities on

4
00:01:49,125 --> 00:01:52,291
this island is currently
under our strict control.

5
00:01:52,375 --> 00:01:54,833
Our purpose here is
to inspect and take over

6
00:01:54,916 --> 00:01:57,291
the military forces
on the island.

7
00:01:57,375 --> 00:01:59,083
We promise we will
not harm anyone

8
00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:01,041
who complies with our demands.

9
00:02:01,125 --> 00:02:03,916
However, that will not
necessarily be the case for

10
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,666
those who stand in
the way of our operations.

11
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:07,708
What should I do?

12
00:02:07,791 --> 00:02:09,875
The island is
being occupied now.

13
00:02:09,958 --> 00:02:12,916
I wonder if my Mom
and Dad are doing okay.

14
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:15,583
Oh, mother...

15
00:02:17,416 --> 00:02:20,250
Grandma what's going
to happen to all of us?

16
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:22,541
There's nothing
for you to worry about.

17
00:02:22,625 --> 00:02:24,375
Just be patient my dear.

18
00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:25,583
Huh?

19
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:30,250
Listen up.

20
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:32,125
Until we've
completed our search.

21
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:33,500
Nobody leaves.

22
00:02:33,583 --> 00:02:36,375
Everyone, sit tight.
Your meals will be ready soon.

23
00:02:36,458 --> 00:02:39,041
I want you to keep a close
watch on the island residents.

24
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:39,958
Yes, sir.

25
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:41,458
Also...

26
00:02:41,541 --> 00:02:44,625
...tell Kariya she needs to
hurry up and find the core.

27
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:49,625
I could get used
to sitting right here.

28
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:55,416
Where on earth did the core go?

29
00:02:57,666 --> 00:02:59,083
Hmm...

30
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:03,875
Just how many times have
we played Old Maid now?

31
00:03:03,958 --> 00:03:06,000
I don't remember.
I wasn't keeping track.

32
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:09,291
Hey! How much longer
before we get to eat?

33
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:12,583
Why wouldn't you let me
go out there and fight?

34
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:15,041
How could you just hand
over control of the island?

35
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:17,000
What about when
Mr. Mizoguchi comes back?

36
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:19,750
What? Do you not
wish to face Kazuki?

37
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:20,875
Is that it?

38
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:22,458
No, it's not like that...

39
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:24,166
You are not to
fight against humans.

40
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:25,208
Understand?

41
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:27,208
No matter what
ends up happeneing.

42
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:29,208
For as long as
blood has been shed,

43
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:32,333
you will be the one who
suffers when Kazuki comes back.

44
00:03:32,416 --> 00:03:33,666
And what about you?

45
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:36,583
Tell me something, how much
blood have you shed?

46
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:39,041
I've shed far too much.

47
00:03:39,125 --> 00:03:41,666
Listen Soshi, if you come
to learn that Kazuki has

48
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:44,583
shed another person's blood,
then do me a favor.

49
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:47,083
help him in any way you can.

50
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:49,708
I will.
I'm going to help him.

51
00:03:49,791 --> 00:03:51,166
Thank you.

52
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:54,083
After all that he's done.
Do you still believe in him?

53
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:55,458
Yes.

54
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:57,833
However, he did leave
without talking to me first.

55
00:03:57,916 --> 00:04:01,000
So I'm not sure whether
or not he believes in me.

56
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:02,958
Unfortunately that's the truth.

57
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:04,041
I understand.

58
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:07,041
Because I feel
exactly the same way.

59
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:14,791
We're taking off now.

60
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:16,541
We're going to be
tracking down that machine.

61
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:17,875
Got it.

62
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:21,291
Well once again...
I wasn't able to do anything.

63
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,916
That's not true.

64
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,583
You were able to do something.

65
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:26,291
The very fact that you
were there during the

66
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:29,291
last moment was a
salvation to Yoji, Maya.

67
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:32,666
You mean that I
helped by just being there?

68
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:35,916
That's right.
Now, let's go see Kazuki.

69
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,208
Mother, is that you?

70
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:54,791
It is yours now.

71
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:58,541
I'm handing over this Mark Sein
to you on behalf of Yoji Hino.

72
00:04:58,625 --> 00:05:01,083
Mark Sein?
Mr. Hino?

73
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:03,041
Yoji Hino no longer exists...

74
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:04,083
Huh?

75
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:06,750
We have come to
the decision that

76
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:09,041
I shall no longer be
a separate entity.

77
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:12,416
Wait. Mom!
You're my Mom, aren't you?

78
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,791
Akane Makabe no longer exists.

79
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:18,875
I am the one your people have
been referring to as Festum.

80
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:23,750
Child of Alvis, I hereby leave
the MIR vessel in your hands.

81
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:27,125
Get on.
I must leave you now.

82
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:33,125
I don't understand.
How could she?

83
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:46,666
I have one final observation to
report to our collective mind.

84
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:50,583
It is over. We have
limited your existence.

85
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:52,083
We are beginning to understand

86
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:54,583
the concept of
human individuality.

87
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:57,708
What do you speak of?
We do not understand.

88
00:05:57,791 --> 00:06:00,833
It is your own rejection
that is the cause of that.

89
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:03,458
How can it be?
I am us.

90
00:06:03,541 --> 00:06:05,333
Then why are you using words?

91
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:07,750
I have stopped
the divergence already.

92
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:09,625
If you and I are
supposed to be one,

93
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:12,416
why are we having
a conversation?

94
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:23,333
How strange...

95
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:27,083
...when I'm inside of this thing
It feels totally different.

96
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:35,250
Mom?

97
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:37,791
As a direct result of the
existence of another MIR that

98
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:39,500
was supposed to
become one with us,

99
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:41,666
I have become a unique entity.

100
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:45,291
And that is identical to the
process of you becoming you.

101
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:47,250
I felt it was
important for us to

102
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:49,791
understand that
final observation.

103
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:52,958
Your existence
has been eradicated.

104
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:57,291
No! Wait. Don't!

105
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:02,458
It ate her...

106
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:05,208
It just ate my mother!

107
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:24,708
Kazuki...
where are you?

108
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:27,291
Hey.
Take a look at that!

109
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:34,333
That's the machine we're after.

110
00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:36,250
It's Kazuki!

111
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:37,250
What on earth is
going on down there?

112
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:38,791
Kazuki.

113
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:00,750
It's been born.

114
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:02,750
Huh?
What do you mean?

115
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,958
It has only just appeared.

116
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:06,833
Although, you are
on the verge of causing

117
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:08,541
the core to be reborn...

118
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:10,125
Kazuki.

119
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:18,208
Why did she die?

120
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:22,083
Answer me.
Was she sick or something?

121
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:25,708
It was all my fault.

122
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:31,916
Dad.
She was right here.

123
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:34,333
Where am I?

124
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:43,791
What happened to Soshi's eye?

125
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:46,083
I heard he was playing by
himself and just fell down.

126
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:48,000
Oh the poor thing.

127
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:49,458
It was all my fault.

128
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:50,375
Ouch!

129
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:51,791
Ouch!

130
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:53,375
Ouch!

131
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:54,875
I did it to him.

132
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:57,916
I heard it will be difficult for
Soshi's left eye to heal.

133
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,083
It's a nasty infection...

134
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:01,291
Did he really get
it just from falling?

135
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:03,458
Why? You think
it wasn't an accident?

136
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:04,833
Why...

137
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,291
...why didn't you just
tell them I did it?

138
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,083
Soshi...

139
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:11,375
Because of that,
I haven't been able to

140
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:13,875
bring myself to
apologize to you...

141
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:16,083
It's been so long.

142
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:19,625
If I could...
I'd do it myself.

143
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:21,375
It's because of
your eye, isn't it?

144
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:24,166
That's why you can't
pilot Fafner, am I right?

145
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:27,291
It's my fault.
So why don't you blame me?

146
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:30,291
Why didn't you just admit I was
the one who did that to you?!

147
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:31,833
Is it because I ran away?

148
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:34,958
Is that why you stayed
silent all this time?

149
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:37,041
I was so scared.

150
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:39,458
And I was also scared of
myself for having hurt you.

151
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:42,000
That's why I ran away.

152
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:44,833
But you're still angry
with me, aren't you!

153
00:10:44,916 --> 00:10:46,416
You hate me for it, don't you!

154
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,916
And that's why you're telling
me to fight and risk my life!

155
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,708
Soshi!

156
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:59,291
For a long time...
I wanted to disappear.

157
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:02,583
It would be better...
if I could just disappear...

158
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:06,166
But still at least I wanted
to apologize to you...

159
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,500
The first feeling of pain.

160
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:11,250
Who are you?

161
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:14,916
Just like the manner in which
the core woke me up to who I am,

162
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,583
you made Soshi the
person who he is.

163
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:20,750
His wound is important.
It is proof of who he is.

164
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:24,625
Believe it or not, Soshi is
actually grateful to you.

165
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:26,000
Grateful?

166
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:29,375
Kazuki...
Why did you hurt Soshi?

167
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:31,125
It's cuz...

168
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:35,083
I will help you remember
what happened.

169
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:37,125
The truth.

170
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:06,833
Are you there?

171
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:38,125
Soshi...

172
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:40,125
What was it you
were trying to do?

173
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:42,541
It' s called assimilation.

174
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:45,250
I heard we can become one.

175
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:46,875
Soshi...

176
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,625
Let's become one...
Kazuki.

177
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:04,166
It's swallowing up
everything that it touches.

178
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,333
Yoji.

179
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:07,291
Just what kind of
monster did you create?

180
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:09,541
Is Kazuki down
there with that thing?

181
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:11,083
I don't know.

182
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:16,875
Damnit!
What's it doing?

183
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:18,583
Trying to swallow us?

184
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:25,541
In the beginning,
We were one entity.

185
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:28,125
And we were in
a large deep place.

186
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:30,125
Every one of us
came out of there.

187
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:32,916
That's when we
all became separate.

188
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,250
I became who I am.
You became who you are.

189
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:38,666
And the words were born.

190
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:39,708
Everything is one.

191
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:41,708
There are no
strangers in this world.

192
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:46,750
And the desire to return to that
place is merely a new discovery.

193
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:48,708
Because you cannot have a desire

194
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:52,125
to go back there if you
don't exist anywhere.

195
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:55,250
That is how many of the
contacts came into being.

196
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:57,375
We even view hurting
each other the way we

197
00:13:57,458 --> 00:14:00,583
are doing right now,
as filled with possibilities.

198
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:02,541
I don't get it.
What do you mean?

199
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:04,875
Are you telling a fairytale?

200
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:06,375
Yeah...

201
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:09,583
It's a fairy tale about this
universe and the rest of us.

202
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:13,958
It is the one and only story
passed down to us from god.

203
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:17,625
A story that is
both happy and sad.

204
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:21,541
It's a phenomenon
called assimilation.

205
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:24,416
I heard it's a way to go
back to a far away place

206
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,250
that is marked in our body.

207
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:27,666
A way back?

208
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:30,125
The genetic code
is implanted within us.

209
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:34,083
It's in our genes.
Dad said so. 

210
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,041
And he also told me
that I was born for the

211
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:40,791
purpose of protecting
the core of this island.

212
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:42,625
It means my life's not my own.

213
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:45,291
I can't live for
myself or anyone else.

214
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:47,000
But Soshi?

215
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:50,000
Right from the beginning
I never existed anywhere.

216
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:53,958
So I want to go back to that far
away place with you, Kazuki...

217
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:55,875
...and become one.

218
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:58,958
Soshi...
Is that why?

219
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:01,791
The assimilation phenomenon
is but one choice.

220
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:03,375
There's also another option.

221
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:05,875
You see, our bodies are
imprinted with a way for

222
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:09,166
us to go forward as well
as backward, Kazuki.

223
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:11,166
Have you come
to a decision then?

224
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:12,666
What's your choice?

225
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,250
I don't know.

226
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,458
What will you do?
Are you going to stay?

227
00:15:18,541 --> 00:15:19,833
I...

228
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:23,416
Or perhaps...
you want to disappear?

229
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,875
All that I want...

230
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:26,875
...is just to...

231
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:31,041
...to be able to
talk to Soshi again.

232
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:34,000
Soshi?

233
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:36,833
It seems that you
have chosen to be here.

234
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:39,000
But why?
Why did I?

235
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:40,500
This conversation...

236
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:43,708
...is a proof of who I am,
and also proof of who you are.

237
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:45,000
Kazuki.

238
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:47,041
This conversation...

239
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:50,000
You have shown the
core which direction to go.

240
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:52,041
I thank you.

241
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,041
That's it!
We're getting outta here!

242
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,375
We can't!

243
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:04,000
What if Kazuki's down
there and needs our help?

244
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:06,250
Oh no!

245
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:11,791
Did you see that?

246
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:13,541
Was it Kazuki?

247
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:23,916
I don't believe it!
That thing is eating itself.

248
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:33,416
Isn't that?

249
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:57,666
It's Kazuki!

250
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:03,666
Wait a minute.
Isn't that Maya?

251
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,625
What is she doing here?

252
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:10,125
During the day,

253
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:12,250
you can find yellow jackets
or scarab beetles.

254
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:14,083
And if I want to
catch a stag beetle,

255
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:16,750
I usually set up a trap
in the early evening.

256
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:18,291
Then what do you do?

257
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:20,875
I actually hate using traps
because I think they're cruel.

258
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:23,041
I look for a tree that
has sap during the day,

259
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,375
and make a map so
that I can find it at night.

260
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:28,291
The guys in the biology club
always set up traps blindly.

261
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:31,375
But I bury all of theirs
whenever I run across them.

262
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:34,083
But they get upset
when they find out.

263
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:35,750
That's good of you.

264
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:39,458
I make sure to return the insect
after I finish my research too.

265
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:40,958
I see.

266
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:44,125
Oh, come to think of it...
I don't even know your name.

267
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:45,625
My name is...

268
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:47,333
Wh-What?

269
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:48,833
What's the matter?

270
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:51,458
They're coming.

271
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:07,625
If I don't do this now,

272
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:09,333
I'm afraid I won't
get another chance.

273
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:10,416
What should I do?

274
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,500
Michio!

275
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,125
What are you doing over there?

276
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:14,500
Shh!
You idiot!

277
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:16,666
Don't be shouting my
name in a place like this!

278
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,375
But you told me to
call you by your name.

279
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:19,875
Fine. Alright.

280
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:22,125
Why don't we just go now?

281
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:26,250
Looks like you've been
hiding all the good stuff.

282
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:27,750
You sure there
isn't anything else?

283
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:29,083
I don't know.

284
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:30,875
And if you don't believe me,
search for yourself.

285
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:31,916
What!

286
00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:34,666
Will you let me go home now?

287
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:37,458
I have an important
deadline to meet.

288
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:44,208
The island's defense
system is still active.

289
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:46,875
That means the core is
still on the island, right?

290
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:48,541
Yes.
I'm positive of that.

291
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:50,125
But I need extra manpower.

292
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:52,375
We are about to intercept
the enemy right now.

293
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:54,875
Do you think I'm in a
position to spare any staff?

294
00:18:54,958 --> 00:18:56,875
Why don't you just hurry
it up and get on with

295
00:18:56,958 --> 00:18:58,875
your search so that you
don't hold us back.

296
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:00,833
And remember I'm
reporting the details

297
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:02,208
of your progress
to headquarters.

298
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:04,208
So you can be sure
that a certain man

299
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:06,750
you trust will be
seeing all of it.

300
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:09,583
He means Mitsuhiro...

301
00:19:09,666 --> 00:19:12,375
Festum detected.
It's 120 meters away.

302
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:14,541
More Festums approaching
from the southwest.

303
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:17,541
This will be a good opportunity
to try out the Nothung Models.

304
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:18,541
You're actually going to let

305
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:20,250
these people get
into the Fafners?

306
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:22,583
But they haven't gone through
the mind alteration test...

307
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:23,958
It'll be too dangerous!

308
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:26,083
Don't you worry about a thing.

309
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:28,750
We've done extensive research
on the Nothung Model data.

310
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:31,041
And these girls have
been hand-picked.

311
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:32,583
Now hurry up and deploy them.

312
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:33,916
No.
You can't...

313
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,416
Come on. Let me in.

314
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,791
I'm afraid not...

315
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:38,833
This place is off limits to
everyone including you.

316
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:40,583
Do you really believe
that you'll be

317
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:42,666
able to handle that CDC?

318
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,916
It's okay.
You can go on and let her in.

319
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,916
I'll take full
responsibility for her.

320
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,041
Yes, sir.

321
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:50,166
It can't be...

322
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:52,916
Yumiko.
Have you been well?

323
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,625
It's been awhile.

324
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,166
Hey where do you
think you're going?

325
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:03,625
Who are you?
Do I know you?

326
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:07,083
Hey Triple six.
Time to take off!

327
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:08,625
I-I'll be there right away.

328
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,666
Hey, wait a minute.
Yumiko!

329
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:13,375
I don't know you.
So don't follow me.

330
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:16,291
What was that about?
Who was that woman?

331
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:45,000
Kazuki.

332
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:48,000
Thank goodness.
That you're safe.

333
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:51,291
Are you really here?
Maya...

334
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:52,958
...is it you?

335
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:55,250
Yes, that's right.

336
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:58,166
It's me.
I'm right here.

337
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:00,166
Thank you, Maya.

338
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:01,500
What about Soshi?

339
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:05,166
He's back on the island.
So don't worry.

340
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:08,875
And he's waiting for you.
I just know that he is.

341
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:10,083
This entire time.

342
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:12,291
He knew what was
beyond the island.

343
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:14,375
I wanted to see that too.

344
00:21:14,458 --> 00:21:15,666
I had thought that...

345
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:18,333
...If I saw it I would
understand him better.

346
00:21:18,416 --> 00:21:19,750
Of course.

347
00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:22,000
But I didn't leave because
I was afraid of fighting.

348
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:23,000
I know.

349
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:24,541
It's just...

350
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:27,166
I was really afraid that I
wouldn't exist anywhere else.

351
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:28,500
That's how I felt.

352
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:32,166
It's okay Kazuki.
I understand.

353
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:34,625
I thought things would be better

354
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:37,791
if I just disappeared for
awhile, but I don't know.

355
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:41,416
Let's go home.

356
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:45,458
When we're there,
we can talk about it again.

357
00:21:45,541 --> 00:21:48,833
Because if we don't,
I feel like it's not just you,

358
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:51,375
but I might disappear too.

359
00:21:51,458 --> 00:21:55,041
So that's why...
we should talk things through.

360
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,958
♪ closing song ♪

361
00:22:03,458 --> 00:22:06,875
I'm getting way
too old for this kind of stuff.

362
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:15,666
I'm surprised that
you didn't get hurt.

363
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:18,000
Mr. Mizoguchi,
did you already know?]

364
00:22:18,083 --> 00:22:20,250
Huh?
About what?

365
00:22:20,333 --> 00:22:24,083
What happened to my mother.
And why it is she disappeared.

366
00:22:24,166 --> 00:22:27,166
Akane was trying to protect
Fumihiko and that's why...

367
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:28,958
...the Festum absorbed her...

368
00:22:29,041 --> 00:22:30,458
I saw it all.

369
00:22:30,541 --> 00:22:32,333
I was right there
when it happened.

370
00:22:32,416 --> 00:22:33,666
I see...

371
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:36,250
So that's why Dad
said it was all his fault.

372
00:22:36,333 --> 00:22:38,083
Kazuki.

373
00:22:38,166 --> 00:22:40,833
Thank you for sharing that
with me, Mr. Mizoguchi.

374
00:22:40,916 --> 00:22:44,208
Things are making much more
sense now thanks to you.

375
00:22:44,666 --> 00:22:46,083
Now that that's all settled,

376
00:22:46,166 --> 00:22:47,875
it's time for us
to go back home.

377
00:22:47,958 --> 00:22:51,583
It's not exactly going back.
It's different now.

378
00:22:51,666 --> 00:22:54,458
I just can't think of the island
in the same way as I did before,

379
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:56,875
when I didn't know
everything that I know now.

380
00:22:56,958 --> 00:23:00,000
So perhaps...
rather than going back to it...

381
00:23:00,083 --> 00:23:03,375
Tatsumiya Island is the place
where I'm going forward to.

382
00:23:03,458 --> 00:23:05,750
The place that I'm headed.

383
00:23:05,833 --> 00:23:08,708
Someone else once told
me something very similar.

384
00:23:09,083 --> 00:23:12,250
He said that he couldn't think
in the same way he had before.

385
00:23:12,333 --> 00:23:13,541
And that he had to do everything

386
00:23:13,625 --> 00:23:16,000
in his power to
protect the island.

387
00:23:16,083 --> 00:23:19,125
Who said that?
Could it be...?

388
00:23:20,583 --> 00:23:22,166
Soshi.

389
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:39,708
The changing island.

390
00:23:39,791 --> 00:23:42,750
Friends who
continue to get hurt.

391
00:23:43,541 --> 00:23:48,875
And then there are her words...
which come from the skies.

392
00:23:50,666 --> 00:23:55,666
Next on Fafner:
episode number sixteen.

393
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:57,583
"Welcome Home."

394
00:23:59,083 --> 00:24:00,875
Are you there?
