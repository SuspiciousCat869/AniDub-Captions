1
00:00:13,958 --> 00:00:15,000
These are the children with

2
00:00:15,083 --> 00:00:17,458
high synergetic code
formation values.

3
00:00:21,833 --> 00:00:25,125
Some of those children will have
to depart again, won't they?

4
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:32,291
By now, I'm sure you have
already heard about the neo U.N.

5
00:00:32,375 --> 00:00:35,958
recon planes conducting frequent
searches over the island.

6
00:00:36,041 --> 00:00:36,958
And...

7
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:38,666
I'm thinking of
moving the island,

8
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:42,000
temporarily to an
archipelago in the northwest.

9
00:00:43,583 --> 00:00:44,833
Lindwurm?

10
00:00:44,916 --> 00:00:47,125
According to him the
Mark Elf is more compatible

11
00:00:47,208 --> 00:00:49,041
with Lindwurm than the Mark Zex.

12
00:00:49,375 --> 00:00:52,541
Increase gravity pull to
120 at a heading of 9 o'clock.

13
00:00:52,625 --> 00:00:56,000
Neo U.N. plane spotted at
6 o'clock, 60 kilometers away,

14
00:00:56,083 --> 00:00:58,333
approaching the
island rapidly.

15
00:00:58,416 --> 00:01:00,041
What exactly's going on?

16
00:01:00,125 --> 00:01:01,875
We're in a battle.

17
00:01:04,291 --> 00:01:09,250
♪ opening song ♪

18
00:02:31,708 --> 00:02:34,000
A Neo U.N. search
plane is approaching.

19
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:37,541
It will pass over the island
in about 25 minutes.

20
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:38,833
That's right.

21
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:41,083
The Neo U.N. plane
is going to be our decoy.

22
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:43,875
Meanwhile, we'll start
moving the island.

23
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:49,083
All staff, report to stations.

24
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:50,708
LDA is unfolding.

25
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:52,666
Locking Gewitter

26
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,875
Locking Gewitter
units three and four.

27
00:02:55,458 --> 00:02:57,000
Releasing Fafner cage.

28
00:02:57,083 --> 00:02:59,833
Transfer AVC Lindwurm
to the turntable.

29
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:01,250
Move the block.

30
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,375
Final safety check all green.

31
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:12,333
Secure Fafner
to the contact position.

32
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:14,291
Lock Contact Arm.

33
00:03:18,416 --> 00:03:20,291
Fafner has made contact.

34
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:24,041
This is Lindwurm!

35
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:25,458
Take off!

36
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:29,500
Now let's go!

37
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:50,958
This is the location we
received from the contact.

38
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:54,708
The coordinates were
definitely for Tatsumiya Island.

39
00:03:56,125 --> 00:03:57,583
Something moved just now.

40
00:03:57,666 --> 00:03:58,458
What?

41
00:03:58,541 --> 00:04:00,333
Isn't that an API 1?

42
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:06,916
It's Festom!

43
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,833
May day!
May day!

44
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:08,708
Do you read me?

45
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:10,333
Young Star 2 reporting!

46
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:14,000
Sphinx type found
at point N Zero Two.

47
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:24,250
The Sphinx Model
is following us!

48
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:38,833
The Neo U.N.
recon plane has come

49
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:40,916
into contact with the Sphinx.

50
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:45,791
The key is how far they'll
be able to get from it.

51
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:47,458
We'll see.

52
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:49,083
What's the sailing phase status?

53
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:50,708
Phases eighty-two
through ninety-six

54
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:52,791
of the alpha line have
been all cleared.

55
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:55,375
The beta line is
currently at phase 63.

56
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:57,416
It's not even half way yet.

57
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:00,333
I see.

58
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:10,083
Attention all island residents.

59
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:13,125
The relocation of Tatsumiya
Island has been re-scheduled

60
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:16,916
from 1000 hours tomorrow
to 1900 hours today.

61
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,458
Repeat.

62
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:19,625
The relocation of Tatsumiya
Island has been re-scheduled...

63
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:21,666
It looks like we'll
be leaving earlier.

64
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:24,208
They're just a bunch
of selfish old bastards.

65
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:26,083
They never even
think of other people.

66
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:27,583
You're absolutely right.

67
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:30,208
And so we have lots to prepare.

68
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:44,458
Load on as many
supplies as possible!

69
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:52,875
It's no use!

70
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:54,041
We can't get away from it!

71
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:55,541
Don't give up!

72
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:07,375
Listen Kazuki.

73
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:09,666
Just remember
to keep your nose out.

74
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,958
We're not going to be conducting
a rescue mission here.

75
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:18,625
Festom is approaching.

76
00:06:18,708 --> 00:06:21,416
It's extending feeler-like
objects toward us.

77
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,125
What the hell?

78
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:28,250
Are you there?

79
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:30,291
The output is increasing.
Get away from it!

80
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:31,083
We can't!

81
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:32,416
We're screwed!

82
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,750
No!

83
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:35,375
Are you there?

84
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:45,416
Hey! That's...

85
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:51,666
Kazuki

86
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,583
Don't do it, Kazuki!

87
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:55,166
But... I...

88
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,875
I must save them.

89
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:01,750
We've no choice.

90
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:02,958
Kazuki.

91
00:07:03,041 --> 00:07:05,333
There's no way
we can go back now.

92
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:08,500
You're going to need to
follow me from here on out.

93
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:20,208
Do you think
that we'll get away?

94
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:22,833
If we gain some
time we'll be okay.

95
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:31,333
Sphinx model appears to now
be targeting to Lindwurm.

96
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:34,750
I instructed them to avoid
contact with the Neo U.N. plane.

97
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:36,333
Saving them is
only going to bring

98
00:07:36,416 --> 00:07:39,041
about a whole world
of trouble later.

99
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:43,041
Alpha line phases one
hundred thirty-eight through

100
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:45,458
one hundred seventy-seven
have all been cleared.

101
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:46,875
Beta line has also cleared.

102
00:07:46,958 --> 00:07:48,625
All components of
the Brunhilde System

103
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:50,083
are greenlit and ready to go!

104
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:50,875
Good.

105
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:52,750
Release Dux Stopper.

106
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:56,750
Miss Kariya!

107
00:07:57,458 --> 00:07:59,666
Please, you have to let
us all go in there too.

108
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:02,791
The reality is that none of
you would be of any help.

109
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:05,208
What's happening
to Kazuki and others?

110
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:08,458
I don't need to explain the
details of our tactics to you.

111
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:10,041
What's going on, Miss Kariya?

112
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:11,833
You usually answer
the questions we have!

113
00:08:11,916 --> 00:08:14,291
This is different.
We're not at school!

114
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:25,916
All of them...

115
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:29,291
What do they think
that they're trying to do?

116
00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:32,541
I can't believe
we're really at war.

117
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,666
Are you there?

118
00:08:57,125 --> 00:08:58,833
Amazing!

119
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,666
Who does that plane belong to?

120
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:07,708
Could it have possibly
come from API1?

121
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:13,000
The relocation of Tatsumiya
Island is about to begin.

122
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:14,791
Those citizens who
live along the coast,

123
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:16,625
are advised to watch
out for high waves.

124
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:17,541
What?

125
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:19,750
Huh? Bastards!

126
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:22,125
Commence with the
final phase to set sail.

127
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:24,708
Attention. Notice to the
personnel of all departments.

128
00:09:24,791 --> 00:09:27,833
Release the outer
rim attachments now.

129
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:52,458
Today's the last day that

130
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:55,541
Guren Island serves as
a resource center, right?

131
00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:58,458
Elimination of Guren
Island complete!

132
00:09:58,541 --> 00:10:01,875
Unfold Walle Shield, and begin
transmitting dummy Beacon.

133
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:05,416
Guren Island is going to serve
as a decoy for us from now on.

134
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,666
Connect propulsion power.

135
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:13,708
Confirm systems
to begin sailing.

136
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:30,291
Brunhilde System
operations report.

137
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:31,250
All normal.

138
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:33,375
Purge outer rim anchoring axle.

139
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:10,375
So, we are finally
leaving this place.

140
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:20,583
It has been a long time.

141
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:33,083
All of the pre-sailing
phases have been completed.

142
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:35,125
Start the engines now!

143
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:37,500
Preparing to start the engines!

144
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:41,833
Internal pressure
of engines increasing.

145
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:45,916
Engine numbers one through
six are showing no problems.

146
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,583
Move forward at slow-speeds!

147
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:49,083
Move forward!

148
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,375
Guren Island is separated.

149
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:13,083
No problems with
any connecting joints.

150
00:12:58,625 --> 00:13:00,666
Maintaining speed at 5 knots.

151
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,000
Good!

152
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:04,500
Make sure the tide
control level is secured at 7.

153
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:07,250
Maintain control levels at 7.

154
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:18,250
Expand the warning area
to a circumference of 200.

155
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:29,458
We've got to try and take
a picture of this plane!

156
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:30,708
Why won't they leave!

157
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:32,500
Kazuki!

158
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,916
It's attempting
to assimilate again.

159
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:58,083
I didn't know we could do that?

160
00:13:58,166 --> 00:14:00,208
It's no big deal.
Don't act so surprised.

161
00:14:05,416 --> 00:14:06,125
All right.

162
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:07,833
It's time for us to leave.

163
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:15,208
Soshi look!

164
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:32,333
Did that plane just save us?

165
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:34,125
Lindwurm's field
of combat is in the

166
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:36,333
middle of Tatsumiya
Island's direct path.

167
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:37,958
At this rate, they will
be entering the number

168
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:40,291
two defense block
in about 5 minutes.

169
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:42,791
Just what do those two
think they're doing?!

170
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:48,083
Mrs. Kaname, why don't
we trying changing

171
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:49,458
the course
of the island?

172
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:52,083
Because that would
take us over half a day.

173
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:02,666
All of this is meaningless
unless we destroy the core.

174
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:06,000
If that's what needs to be
done, I'll go there and do it.

175
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:14,375
Release me into that thing!

176
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:52,291
There's been an impact
on the island's surface.

177
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:53,833
It's inevitable now.

178
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:56,458
We'll have to blow our cover
if we want to save the island.

179
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:57,958
Are you sure?: 

180
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,916
Disable the
camouflage surface.

181
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,750
Set up Walle Shield.

182
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,291
Kazuki!

183
00:16:38,416 --> 00:16:39,875
But, that's...

184
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:49,958
Uh... A song.
I can hear it.

185
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,333
What are we hearing?

186
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:06,625
Do you hear that? Who's singing?

187
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:16,958
You know what to do, right?

188
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:46,833
Sphinx type has vanished.

189
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:52,166
It seems that she
has completely awakened.

190
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,125
That island...

191
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:10,833
Was there an island here before?

192
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:13,041
I don't see anything on the map.

193
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:15,250
Recon plane
Young Star 2 reporting

194
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:17,375
to Headquarters from area 17.

195
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:19,416
We have located an API1.

196
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:23,416
Repeat, Young Star
2 has located an API1.

197
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:28,541
Do you think we'll
be able to land?

198
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:51,083
We landed.

199
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:53,333
Seems to me that we fell.

200
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:02,958
Why did you
ignore the order and

201
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:05,333
rescue the Neo U.N. recon plane?

202
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:06,750
I apologize.

203
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:09,750
It was all my fault.

204
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:12,541
Is it really such a bad thing to

205
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:14,833
rescue someone
when they're in need?

206
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:20,291
Well that all depends
on the situation.

207
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,625
So what do you think?

208
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:38,458
Was I too lenient with them?

209
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:41,625
Well, you are the commander.

210
00:19:50,666 --> 00:19:52,000
Soshi!

211
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,291
Good work guys!

212
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:14,458
The two of you
were simply amazing!

213
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:15,666
You really did it.

214
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,083
You guys saved us.

215
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:18,583
Anyway, I'm glad
that the both of you

216
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:20,625
made it back here
safe and sound.

217
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:21,666
That's right.

218
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:22,833
I think it's great...

219
00:20:22,916 --> 00:20:25,916
Don't mind me,
I'm just happy that's all.

220
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:28,875
All right then guys,
I better take off.

221
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:30,541
I still have my training to do.

222
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:32,958
I gotta learn how to become
as useful as you two.

223
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:36,125
Otherwise I might just
get kicked off the island.

224
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:44,000
He said we saved all of them.

225
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:47,166
But the truth is
we were rescued,

226
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:50,000
by those small flying machines.

227
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:58,250
Koyo!

228
00:20:58,333 --> 00:21:00,083
And where have
you been all this time?

229
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:01,125
Mamoru.

230
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:02,666
Kazuki and Soshi
fought this battle.

231
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:03,666
You should've seen it.

232
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:04,875
It was awesome!

233
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:06,375
Is that so?

234
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:08,583
I expected that.

235
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:10,208
This awesome thing
came out at the end

236
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:11,958
and did this incredibly
awesome stuff.

237
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:13,791
The whole thing
was just so awesome!

238
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:15,166
You know what?

239
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:16,583
I'm sure that they have
some awesome footage of it.

240
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:19,208
You should go and ask
Miss Kariya to show it to you.

241
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:21,000
I think I'd better not.

242
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:23,708
I might get nervous and
lose confidence.

243
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:31,541
These are the coordinates that
were reported by Young Star 2.

244
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:36,583
So we finally found it.

245
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:38,916
The island of Giants.

246
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:57,541
When I started this
day I never expected

247
00:21:57,625 --> 00:21:59,666
that it would end up like this.

248
00:22:05,208 --> 00:22:08,166
It takes a mature sailor
to move an old ship,

249
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:10,041
not a young sailor.

250
00:22:10,958 --> 00:22:15,583
But, the one to find a new
route is always a young sailor.

251
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:18,708
However, the sailing map we

252
00:22:18,791 --> 00:22:23,583
found was a journey
filled with hardships...

253
00:22:24,916 --> 00:22:27,708
...which fell from the sky.

254
00:22:32,375 --> 00:22:37,333
♪ closing song ♪

255
00:23:35,541 --> 00:23:38,166
Tatsumiya Island set sail.

256
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,250
We don't know where we're going.

257
00:23:40,333 --> 00:23:42,500
We can't see what's ahead of us.

258
00:23:42,583 --> 00:23:45,583
And yet we're forced
to take a new step.

259
00:23:46,708 --> 00:23:51,791
And at that time,
two people exchange words.

260
00:23:51,875 --> 00:23:56,500
Next on "Fafner"
episode number five...

261
00:23:56,583 --> 00:23:58,375
Pledge.

262
00:23:59,625 --> 00:24:01,375
Are you there?
