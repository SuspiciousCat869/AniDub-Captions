1
00:00:14,375 --> 00:00:15,666
Kazuki didn't want to
be thought of that way,

2
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,583
that's the reason
he left the island!

3
00:00:17,666 --> 00:00:18,833
He wanted to be thought of as a

4
00:00:18,916 --> 00:00:21,833
person before he
started piloting a Fafner.

5
00:00:23,916 --> 00:00:25,583
...no one even
thought to ask Kazuki

6
00:00:25,666 --> 00:00:28,125
what his feelings were about it!

7
00:00:29,875 --> 00:00:32,458
Let's go! I'm ready!

8
00:00:37,416 --> 00:00:42,375
♪ opening song ♪

9
00:02:10,875 --> 00:02:13,416
All right, I think it's time
that we go and get Kazuki.

10
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,791
Our lift off is probably
going to be really fast.

11
00:02:15,875 --> 00:02:17,666
So be careful that you
don't bite your tongue.

12
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:18,125
Ok, Maya?

13
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:19,583
Oh right.

14
00:02:19,916 --> 00:02:21,791
Something's moving
towards us from underwater.

15
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:23,708
Approaching from
45 degrees south.

16
00:02:23,791 --> 00:02:26,125
Solomon has responded.
It's a submarine.

17
00:02:26,208 --> 00:02:27,583
And they're Humans...

18
00:02:27,666 --> 00:02:28,666
We've got a match.

19
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:31,208
It's a Neo U.N.
submarine, Buronga-type.

20
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:33,416
And I bet they're not
just here for Mark Elf,

21
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,708
they want the whole island...

22
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:36,583
Why's a submarine
coming to the island?

23
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:39,125
Maybe they're coming to
look for buried treasure.

24
00:02:39,208 --> 00:02:42,250
Fumihiko can handle it.
We've got other things to do!

25
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:43,416
All right, clench your teeth!

26
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,583
Right!

27
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:00,583
A plane is leaving
the island sir.

28
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:02,500
Shoot it down at once.

29
00:03:07,708 --> 00:03:08,625
Huh?

30
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:10,875
Hold on,
we're in for a bumpy ride.

31
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,125
Good job Norn, and just in time.

32
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:32,916
We have confirmation.
They made it out safely.

33
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,250
Checking internal defense.

34
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:36,458
Brunhilde System has
switched to intercept mode.

35
00:03:36,541 --> 00:03:37,791
And Valkyrie's Coagula...

36
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:39,166
...has fully opened.

37
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,875
Neo U.N. Fafners
are approaching rapidly!

38
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:42,916
There is no time for the
number one Welle Shield.

39
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,791
Deploy the number
two Welle Shield!

40
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:46,291
And move to Vaffe Larden.

41
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:47,791
I'm gonna send Fafners.

42
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:49,041
No!

43
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:50,791
I can not let you
deploy the Fafners

44
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:53,416
to fight against humans, Soshi.

45
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:56,583
The number two Welle
Shield has been neutralized.

46
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:59,208
The Welle Shield is down?

47
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:01,041
Someone who knows
the island inside

48
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:03,333
and out is leading them here...

49
00:04:03,416 --> 00:04:05,666
Begin evacuation
of island residents!

50
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:08,625
Reprogram the Brunhilde System
so that it's unable to fight.

51
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:11,000
Are you just going to
surrender without a fight!

52
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:14,083
They've come here to take our
Fafners and the island's core.

53
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:16,500
But they'll never
be able to handle them.

54
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:18,833
We'll let them learn
that for themselves...

55
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:21,500
Do you suppose they'll bring
their Fafners out to fight?

56
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:25,333
If they are attacked
they will. I'm sure of it.

57
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:27,416
Fire at their
outer coastal area!

58
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,875
As a little greeting from us.

59
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:37,125
Takeru Island has been hit!

60
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:38,500
They fired at us...

61
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:40,125
I can't believe they did that!

62
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:40,916
Commander!

63
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,833
Do not return their fire!

64
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:45,416
Once you've shed blood
you can never go back.

65
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,125
We'll wait!

66
00:04:58,041 --> 00:04:59,500
No retaliation from the enemy,

67
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:01,583
and no Interceptor
planes have taken off.

68
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:04,208
Why don't they counterattack,
it makes no sense?

69
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:07,708
I thought it was improbable,
but not unexpected.

70
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:09,083
Not all that long ago,

71
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:12,208
Fumihiko was second to
none in destroying Festum...

72
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:16,458
Yet he won't attack humans.
He's not fit to be a commander.

73
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:18,041
Begin the landing!

74
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:21,125
I want the enemy headquarters
under our control immediately!

75
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:25,416
But be sure to be
gentleman like to them.

76
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:44,250
Eight enemy Fafners
have landed on the

77
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:45,916
south end of Tatsumiya Island.

78
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,541
The Neo U.N. has brought out
the Gnosis Model as well?

79
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:52,291
And enemy ground soldiers have
come ashore at S18 bloc one!

80
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:55,791
It's just a matter of time
before they penetrate Alvis.

81
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:26,041
Come on, hurry up people!

82
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:27,916
You've got to get to
Alvis right away!

83
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,416
Sop right there!

84
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,583
You are not allowed
to come with us!

85
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:33,000
What?

86
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:35,375
All right, quickly go!

87
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:38,583
What an island!

88
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:46,375
Head back two blocks then
you can come around again.

89
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,125
It defends but
doesn't counterattack...

90
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:51,166
it's very strange.

91
00:06:53,416 --> 00:06:55,291
Wow it's Yumiko's house...

92
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:57,875
Heh.
It hasn't changed a bit.

93
00:06:58,416 --> 00:07:02,125
Please don't resist us.
I don't want to hurt anyone.

94
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:42,416
At last...
I can be a help to you...

95
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,500
Mitsuhiro.

96
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:46,666
The external walls of Alvis
have been breached!

97
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,375
The elevator is
still in operation

98
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:51,125
and the enemy is headed
for Valkyrie's Coagula!

99
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:53,375
Everyone head to
the shelter right away.

100
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:55,416
I'll stay and man the controls!

101
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,416
No, you can't Commander!

102
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,666
You're not even
gonna try and fight.

103
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,166
How can you call
yourself a commander?!

104
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:03,083
Tell me, are you
honestly prepared to

105
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:06,041
give the pilots the
order to kill humans?

106
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:08,541
We haven't suffered
any casualties as of yet.

107
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:11,625
And it's my intention to make
sure we don't have any.

108
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:13,416
Their Commander
will be here soon...

109
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,333
I intend to negotiate
a settlement.

110
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:28,833
It's not here...

111
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:35,375
I don't believe it.
Its left the Coagula...

112
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:44,791
Don't try anything!

113
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:45,916
Sakura!

114
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,125
You...!

115
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:50,291
Here!

116
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:51,416
Sakura!

117
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,375
Stop right now!
They're only children!

118
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:54,791
They are not ordinary children.

119
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:56,833
Sir, we have captured
three children.

120
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:59,333
I believe that
they're the pilots.

121
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:10,666
What a beautiful island.

122
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,333
A unit that appears
to be leading the

123
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:13,916
main force has come ashore.

124
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,500
It sure took 'em long enough.

125
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:17,666
All right, head to
the shelter right away!

126
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,458
Commander Makabe,
we're not going to leave here,

127
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:20,791
unless you're coming too.

128
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:22,791
We don't except you
staying here by yourself...

129
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:23,916
It's out of the question!

130
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,833
I am definitely staying here.

131
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:28,083
It's my duty to witness
your actions on behalf

132
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:30,000
of the island and
judge your decisions.

133
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:31,875
Then you can stay.

134
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:33,458
Yumiko!

135
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:35,416
I need both you and Rina go to
get yourselves to the shelter.

136
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:38,041
What?
You want me to leave too?

137
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:39,541
But Commander Makabe...

138
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:41,500
I'm sure that some
island residents were

139
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:43,291
injured in their rush
to the shelter.

140
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:46,416
I want you to administer medical
treatment with Dr. Tohmi.

141
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,375
But I...

142
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:48,541
Don't worry.

143
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:50,833
To the Neo U.N.,
the people on this island

144
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:52,791
are just ordinary people...

145
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:54,500
Except for me that is.

146
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:57,500
All right...
You've made yourself clear.

147
00:09:57,583 --> 00:09:59,000
But please stay safe.

148
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:00,791
You too.
Be careful.

149
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:02,708
Rina, just follow the
instructions from

150
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:04,458
Dr. Tohmi and Grandma.

151
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:05,458
I will.

152
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:19,375
Wake up sleepy head.

153
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:25,541
That was weird.
So how long have I been asleep?

154
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,875
Awhile, the acceleration
made you lose consciousness.

155
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:30,375
Why don't you take
a look out the window.

156
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:31,416
What?

157
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,416
They've all escaped
from Moldova.

158
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,500
Our destination is very close.

159
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:37,333
Start working on
a seductive speech to

160
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:39,375
talk Kazuki into
coming back with us.

161
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:41,125
Huh?
What are you talking about?

162
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:43,208
Once he sees you,
I'm sure that he's going

163
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:45,625
to want to come back right away.

164
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:49,250
Sorry but I think
you're wrong about that...

165
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:55,666
I guess...
Shoko knew it too...

166
00:10:57,875 --> 00:11:00,708
Why did the soldiers have to
show up during the club meeting?

167
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:02,916
And where did
everybody run off to!

168
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,416
Mom!
Where are you?

169
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,125
Mom!

170
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,708
What was that voice?
Is somebody out there?

171
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,291
That's great!

172
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:22,458
Since I was born, that's
the first word, I've spoken.

173
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,916
Huh?

174
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:42,750
I was sure that you'd be long
gone with the core by now Yoji.

175
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:44,625
We haven't been
able to locate it.

176
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:46,083
But don't worry we will.

177
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:48,833
And then we'll have the
power to exterminate Festum.

178
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:49,708
For good!

179
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:52,375
Mitsuhiro, Salvator Model is not

180
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:54,375
limited to just
destroying Festum...

181
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:56,291
...it has many more
possibilities than

182
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:57,583
to be used just for fighting.

183
00:11:57,666 --> 00:12:00,625
Don't be ridiculous,
what else is a Fafner for.

184
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:02,750
I'm afraid that you're
never going to know.

185
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:05,333
I'm about to use one of
the base elements that we

186
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:08,125
collected from the MIR
that was active in Japan.

187
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:10,458
The untapped power
should be spectacular.

188
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:13,958
There aren't any pilots who
can handle that power. Hmph!

189
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:15,583
You're gonna blow yourself up.

190
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:19,416
On the flowerbed of extinction,
a new hope will surely blossom.

191
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,333
Just like it did with our
precious children...

192
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:24,125
So good bye Mitsuhiro.

193
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:26,791
The five years I spent with
you weren't bad.

194
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:28,958
But I can't let you
use a Core like that.

195
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:31,666
Then goodbye, Yoji Hino.

196
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,125
I must say,
I never expected that

197
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:37,333
Dr. Hino would betray us...

198
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:39,500
That special core,
just wasted...

199
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:41,083
Don't worry about it.

200
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:44,750
Another core will be collected
very soon, I'm sure of it.

201
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:46,750
A more powerful
machine that replaces

202
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:49,666
the Nothung Model is
nearly completed.

203
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:53,708
Now...

204
00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:56,000
...you who used to
be Akane Makabe...

205
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:57,625
I want you to hand this machine

206
00:12:57,708 --> 00:13:01,000
over to the child of
Alvis personally.

207
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:02,958
We will not allow
me to ever come

208
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:05,166
into contact with Kazuki Makabe.

209
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:07,250
Then just give
the machine to him.

210
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:08,833
I'm sure you can
find out where the

211
00:13:08,916 --> 00:13:11,708
child of Alvis is immediately
whenever you want to.

212
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,416
One is on land...
One is in the sky.

213
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,250
What?
How can that be?

214
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:18,916
There's no one
here besides Kazuki.

215
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,916
She is coming now...

216
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,208
She is nearly here...

217
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,666
They're underground facilities.

218
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:28,666
How are we supposed
to get inside there?

219
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,166
Yes, come in.

220
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:33,250
I am glad to see you, and
pleased that you are still safe.

221
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:34,750
Yoji!

222
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:36,958
How in the world did you know
that we were coming here?

223
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:38,875
I received some
information from someone

224
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:40,375
who used to be one of us.

225
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:43,791
I'm sending you landing
coordinates and clearance now.

226
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:09,791
Everybody!!
Split up now!

227
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:12,916
Eject quickly!

228
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,500
It's too late!
He's already dead.

229
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:17,458
Don't focus on it!
We're soldiers.

230
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:19,458
It's part of our job.

231
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:23,625
There's a face!

232
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:27,000
Are you there?

233
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:33,250
Oh I'm here all right!
Let me show you!

234
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:39,083
Alright here we go, Maya.
Keep up with me!

235
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:40,666
Right!

236
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:49,833
Why it's Miss Kariya...

237
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:51,791
Well, I can't say
that I expected

238
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:53,458
to see you again Major Barns.

239
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:55,125
At least not like this.

240
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:56,666
It's Colonel.

241
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:59,791
I've been promoted, just like
you've became a Commander...

242
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:01,416
Makabe...

243
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:04,041
Why have you
attacked our island?

244
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:05,708
Someone wants a
toy that you have

245
00:15:05,791 --> 00:15:08,041
and they have asked
me to collect it for them.

246
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:09,791
It would be wise
to hand it over.

247
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:11,458
You mean the core I take it.

248
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:13,291
That's right,
and Kariya has something

249
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:14,833
she would like to ask you.

250
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:17,625
You have a lot of nerve coming
back here like this traitor.

251
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:18,666
What do you want from us?

252
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,041
Think about it for a second,

253
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:22,333
who's the real traitor
to the human race?

254
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:25,333
You incredibly selfish people
who hid this much fighting force

255
00:15:25,416 --> 00:15:27,000
to be used only by yourselves,

256
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:29,666
or me who informed the
Neo U.N. about it?

257
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:32,666
So Kariya, which
side is Kazuki fighting for?

258
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,500
I have no idea.

259
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:37,916
You see I don't
even know if he's alive.

260
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,041
While we're answering questions,
why did you release the Coagula?

261
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:43,333
What are you saying?

262
00:15:43,416 --> 00:15:46,208
The Brunhilde System was ...
completely empty!

263
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:48,708
What?
I don't believe it!

264
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:54,541
Damn it!
What are they doing here?

265
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:56,041
This is our island!

266
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:59,750
I can't believe the Neo U.N.
has actually landed here!

267
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:03,416
Ahhh, we made a
great map of the woods

268
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:06,375
and were all going to
collect stag beetles together.

269
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:08,208
Stag beetles?
Really?

270
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:11,583
That's right, stag beetles.
I'm in the biology club.

271
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:13,875
Most people want
to research birds or fish.

272
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:16,458
But I think that
bugs are the best.

273
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:20,208
Living things...
birds...

274
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:22,208
...and fish...

275
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:24,083
...insects...

276
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:27,500
Wait, you'd be safer if
you stayed here with us.

277
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:31,000
Forests...
the wind...

278
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:32,625
...sky...

279
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:34,750
...ocean...

280
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:36,208
The light...

281
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:40,000
...and sound...
all life...

282
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:43,666
That's right.
It's all life.

283
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:53,458
Then, you don't know the
core's where abouts either?

284
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:55,083
If she woke up...

285
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:57,333
...then we are unable
to control her anymore.

286
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:59,583
And you two definitely couldn't.

287
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:02,291
Fumihiko, is what he's
telling us really the truth?

288
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:03,875
Yes.

289
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:05,791
I'm afraid we have no choice but
to let her do what she wants.

290
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:07,041
You're lying!

291
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:09,041
Tell us where you hid
the core immediately.

292
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:10,416
Slow down Kariya.

293
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,583
The island is still
functioning so that means

294
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:15,083
that the core has to
exist here somewhere.

295
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:17,541
You need to locate it
within twenty-four hours.

296
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:19,458
Do you understand?

297
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:21,625
Yes sir, understood.

298
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,958
The island's been
taken over, hasn't it?.

299
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:28,416
Without the core,
the island cannot be taken over.

300
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:29,666
Kenji!

301
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:30,541
Sakura!

302
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:32,833
Get inside now!

303
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:35,000
Are you guys all right?
Did they hurt you?

304
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:36,666
Where is Miss Hazama?

305
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,416
They took Miss Yoko
somewhere else,

306
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,791
we don't know where she is.

307
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:41,458
I can only assume
that they want to

308
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:43,541
isolate the Fafners on
the island somewhere.

309
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:45,958
The island core and
Fafners are not going

310
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:48,000
to be so easy
for them to handle.

311
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:49,041
What's the matter?

312
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:50,791
Why don't you try to leave?

313
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:53,375
Very soon, we will
be coming to this place...

314
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:55,041
You are alone.

315
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:59,958
So tell me, are you in any way
concerned at all about my life?

316
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:01,875
Concerned?

317
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:04,291
Yes that's right.

318
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:06,375
I was just wondering
if the Mir from

319
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:09,583
our side could somehow
be influencing you.

320
00:18:09,666 --> 00:18:11,708
About me that is--

321
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:14,583
Here they come!

322
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:21,083
I was looking for you Yoji!

323
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:22,333
Kyosuke!

324
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:23,625
Mr. Hino.

325
00:18:24,625 --> 00:18:25,583
Oh!

326
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:27,791
You must be
Mitsuhiro's daughter.

327
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:30,000
I've been waiting for you.

328
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:35,416
Yoji Hino, it appears that
you are no longer alone.

329
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,208
I will be leaving now.

330
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:40,333
Yes I understand,
thank you for everything.

331
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:42,541
How did she?

332
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:46,083
She's opened the door
to a new future for us.

333
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:47,625
Here Maya...

334
00:18:47,708 --> 00:18:49,250
...take this...

335
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:51,541
What is it...?

336
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:54,416
The complete Research
data of Mark Sein.

337
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,916
What's Mark Sein?

338
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,875
It simply means existence.

339
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:01,541
I need you to
give this to Fumihiko.

340
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:03,791
What about you?
Mr. Hino.

341
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:06,958
I'll stay here.
I have things to finish.

342
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:10,375
Yoji!
Come on quickly!

343
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:12,916
What in the world is
he doing down there?--

344
00:19:15,708 --> 00:19:17,958
Is that Akane?

345
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:21,291
I don't believe it!
It is Akane!

346
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:23,541
Hey Yoji.
What's going on here anyway?!

347
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:25,708
She's about to leave
to find Kazuki.

348
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:28,125
Then she's going to hand
Mark Sein over to him.

349
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:31,375
You and Kyosuke
need to go and follow her.

350
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:37,083
Kazuki, we're on our way...

351
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:40,958
If you see my son,
please tell him that

352
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:43,958
I'm sorry for taking him
off the island.

353
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:47,583
But thanks to him,

354
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:51,375
I was able to find new hope
based on so much new data.

355
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:06,583
Ahh, I had wanted to talk
with you a little longer...

356
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:09,416
Children of the Mir...

357
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,458
It is my great pleasure
that you were able

358
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:15,500
to understand the
concept of this information...

359
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:19,500
But I can't hand this
information over to you.

360
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:25,833
Forgive me...
Michio...

361
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:34,666
Don't focus on it.

362
00:20:36,791 --> 00:20:38,791
It's part of our job.

363
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:40,791
It can't be...

364
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:49,125
It's part of our job.

365
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:53,416
It's a lie!

366
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:55,500
Why...

367
00:20:55,583 --> 00:20:57,375
Why do you kill?

368
00:20:57,791 --> 00:21:00,375
Why do you kill!?!

369
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:16,541
Darn it!
I can't move at all.

370
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:30,041
What is that?

371
00:21:37,791 --> 00:21:39,625
Amazing...

372
00:21:57,708 --> 00:21:58,791
Huh?

373
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:18,125
It can't be...
It's not possible...

374
00:22:22,416 --> 00:22:25,958
Mother...

375
00:22:29,458 --> 00:22:33,125
Mother, where are you?
Mother?

376
00:22:33,666 --> 00:22:38,625
♪ closing song ♪

377
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:39,500
When the memory
of hurting you becomes

378
00:23:39,583 --> 00:23:43,625
the feeling of desire
to talk to you...

379
00:23:43,708 --> 00:23:46,541
Another power will be born.

380
00:23:49,583 --> 00:23:54,000
Next on Fafner
episode number fifteen.

381
00:23:55,083 --> 00:23:56,541
"Outcry."

382
00:23:57,583 --> 00:23:59,541
Are you there?
