1
00:00:19,833 --> 00:00:21,125
Are you there?

2
00:00:22,333 --> 00:00:24,125
Are you there?

3
00:00:37,541 --> 00:00:38,708
Can't move it!

4
00:00:39,041 --> 00:00:41,166
Can't move my body...!

5
00:00:42,541 --> 00:00:44,500
It's not working!

6
00:00:48,208 --> 00:00:49,291
Kazuki!

7
00:00:49,375 --> 00:00:51,291
Feel Fafner itself!

8
00:00:51,375 --> 00:00:52,875
Unite with it!

9
00:01:33,083 --> 00:01:34,041
Hey, Soshi...

10
00:01:34,125 --> 00:01:35,875
I wonder if we'll
hear it again...

11
00:01:36,583 --> 00:01:38,000
Maybe.

12
00:01:38,083 --> 00:01:40,500
My repairs are perfect!

13
00:01:40,583 --> 00:01:41,500
Perfect?!

14
00:01:41,583 --> 00:01:43,000
Is it true this time?

15
00:01:43,083 --> 00:01:44,708
Wait!

16
00:01:44,791 --> 00:01:46,666
Are you there?

17
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:50,875
It is real after all!

18
00:01:51,208 --> 00:01:53,166
Shall we answer?

19
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:54,708
Alright!

20
00:01:54,791 --> 00:01:56,708
--Here we go!
--Here we go!

21
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:43,250
See y'later...

22
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:44,583
Yeah...

23
00:03:55,791 --> 00:03:56,916
Where's Maya?

24
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,583
She's already left.

25
00:03:58,666 --> 00:04:00,291
Her club's morning practice?

26
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:02,666
She said they weren't
having practice today.

27
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:05,375
Then she prob'ly went
to Hazama's again.

28
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:12,666
Shoko...?

29
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,041
Maya!

30
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:16,791
Yep, it's me again!

31
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:18,166
Today...

32
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:20,041
...can you go?

33
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:25,208
Well, mind if I join you then?

34
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:27,041
Please do!

35
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,500
Yesterday, my mom
scolded me about it.

36
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:31,791
What for?

37
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:33,375
She said, "How are
you going to feel

38
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:34,958
if Maya gets in
trouble for being late

39
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:36,583
because she was visiting you?"

40
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:39,250
I'll be alright, I've got
plenty of time to get there!

41
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:41,000
I can run pretty fast, y'know!

42
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:43,291
Honestly, there's
nothing to worry about!

43
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:44,916
Maya...

44
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,166
Y'look good.

45
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:50,625
A whole lot better
than yesterday!

46
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:58,458
Thank you, Maya.

47
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:03,083
It's time, Dad.

48
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:07,000
Sakura Kaname, leaving
for school on schedule!

49
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:09,708
Goodbye, dear.

50
00:05:13,666 --> 00:05:14,333
Good morning!

51
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:15,041
Good morning...

52
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:16,500
Good morning.

53
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,083
So how's Shoko doin'?

54
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:36,250
She's not quite well yet.

55
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:37,791
I see.

56
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:40,916
But I'm sure she'll
be ready soon!

57
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,791
You're right, Maya!

58
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:48,750
Thank you.

59
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:50,500
Oh, I almost forgot.

60
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:51,583
Here.

61
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:52,875
I'm counting on you.

62
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:55,583
Be careful, alright?
This is an important book.

63
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:57,708
Yes, I understand.

64
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:52,666
Did you come back on
this morning's boat, Soshi?

65
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:53,916
Yes.

66
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,500
I was late because
I was inputting

67
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:57,375
the report over at CDC.

68
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:58,875
Excellent work...

69
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:00,708
 I'm sure you, um...

70
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:05,333
I'm sure that you
learned a lot, eh?

71
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:17,500
Today's sunset...

72
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:20,666
...is going to be a
very special color.

73
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:29,958
No, that's not it!

74
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:31,708
That's not it at all!

75
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:34,833
Sorry...
I was looking the other way.

76
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:35,666
Soshi!

77
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,208
I didn't know you were back.

78
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:38,916
Yeah... Since this morning...

79
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,458
Oh...

80
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:42,208
...here y'go.

81
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:43,750
Welcome back, Sosh!

82
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:47,208
Whoa! Could that possibly be
the incredible latest issue??

83
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:49,500
I've been waiting to see that!

84
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:50,875
Hey, Soshi!

85
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:52,875
So, how did you like Tokyo?

86
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:54,416
Tokyo?

87
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:58,375
It's just an ordinary place,
nothin' special really.

88
00:07:58,458 --> 00:07:59,708
What?!

89
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:01,375
Didn'tcha meet any celebs
while you were there?

90
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:02,416
Nope.

91
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,833
Too bad...

92
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:06,041
Where's Kazuki?

93
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:08,958
He left with Kenji right
after class was dismissed.

94
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:15,291
So...

95
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:18,083
Soshi's come back, hasn't he...

96
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:21,750
So I suppose...

97
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:24,625
I won't be visiting
you at home anymore.

98
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:33,041
That's enough for today.

99
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:33,833
Hey, wait!

100
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:34,541
See ya!

101
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:36,625
Wait a minute, Kazuki!

102
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:39,625
What was that weird
feeling I had just now?

103
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:47,500
Are you there?

104
00:08:58,291 --> 00:08:59,958
Have they found us...?

105
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,625
Huh...?

106
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:19,458
All right.
Next!

107
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:21,333
I'm Koyo Kasugai.

108
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:23,666
Confirmed.

109
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:25,916
There's nothing I can do.

110
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,208
You'll be studying
on your own for a while.

111
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:29,791
On our own?

112
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:31,833
A lotta people
aren't here yet...

113
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:32,833
That's all right.

114
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:34,666
They're in another shelter.

115
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,666
But what is this place?!?

116
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:38,875
It's Alvis...

117
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:41,750
 System-wide link-up completed.

118
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:43,958
Multi-phase
oscillation-wave confirmed.

119
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:46,000
Target's mass is
still increasing.

120
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:47,666
It could be a Sphinx type?

121
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:48,958
And Solomon's Prophecy?

122
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:50,875
It hasn't started yet.

123
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:53,166
Measure the mass and
search for the enemy!

124
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:54,625
Issue Code-Red alert!

125
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:56,333
Take Class Three
battle stations!

126
00:09:56,416 --> 00:09:59,291
All personnel take
Class Three battle stations!

127
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:01,125
Preparing to unfold
Walle Shield--

128
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:03,666
Dispersing reflective
camouflage cover.

129
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:04,791
Hey!

130
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:06,500
There's no shelter
entrance over there!

131
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:08,375
Okay!
Thank you!

132
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:12,541
Huh?!

133
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:19,666
The sun, it's...

134
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:27,000
Camouflage dispersal
has been completed--

135
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:28,708
Unfolding the first
Walle Shield.

136
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:31,000
Have all the residents of the
island been evacuated?

137
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:32,250
At present we can account for

138
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:34,875
93 point seven percent
of the total population.

139
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:36,291
It's got to be destroyed!

140
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:38,875
Bergelmir, we need you
airborne as soon as possible!

141
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:41,416
I know, I know, we're
movin' as fast as we can...

142
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,541
20 seconds to lift
off and counting.

143
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:45,041
Roger that.

144
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:46,541
And please, sweetheart...

145
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:48,583
Be careful, alright?

146
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:50,000
Alright...

147
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:51,708
Enemy identity confirmed.

148
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:54,958
Bergelmir lifting-off
in nine seconds!

149
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:02,166
What was that?!

150
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:04,541
Shoko!

151
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:05,875
Maya!

152
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:07,416
Maya!

153
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:09,833
What happened?!?
Everyone's gone!

154
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:11,750
Coo ran away, too!

155
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:12,916
I'm sure Coo's found a

156
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,583
safe place to hide
till this is over...

157
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:17,250
...which is just
what WE'RE gonna do!

158
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:22,125
It's reached the
outer Walle Shield!

159
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:23,416
Shield power is dropping!

160
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,583
The shield won't hold it!

161
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:26,958
Activate Vaffe Larden
right now!

162
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:39,083
Vaffe Larden
switch-over completed!

163
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:40,791
No change in target trajectory.

164
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:42,333
Target within scanning range.

165
00:11:42,416 --> 00:11:45,500
Redirecting visual feed
to the main screen...

166
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:55,958
So...

167
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:56,750
Then this...

168
00:11:56,833 --> 00:11:58,666
...this is Festom.

169
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:26,208
Then this...

170
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:27,625
...this is Festom...

171
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:29,833
No, not yet, son,
not even close...

172
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,958
My readings show
a semi-metallic element

173
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:36,833
with a density of 2.33
atomic weight 28.0855.

174
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:39,125
Festom is taking shape.

175
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:46,458
It's beautiful...!

176
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:48,000
Yes, I suppose it is.

177
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:50,583
It also intends to exterminate
every human on earth...

178
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:53,416
The load being put on the
Walle Shield is increasing.

179
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,333
There's a 75% chance of total
breakdown within ten seconds!

180
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:57,791
Target coordinates acquired,

181
00:12:57,875 --> 00:13:00,541
accurate to within point
two zero margin of error.

182
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:03,583
We'll attack the moment
the shield begins to collapse.

183
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:09,791
We'll hit it from both sides!

184
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:12,416
And whoever misses a target THIS
big is buyin' dinner tonight!

185
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,541
Alright, let's do it!

186
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:27,708
Hmph!
He avoided our attack...

187
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:30,083
...like he was
reading' my mind...

188
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:36,041
All pilots, eject!
Eject!!

189
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:37,583
I can't!

190
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:50,416
Are you there?

191
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,791
Target is approaching
the second Walle Shield!

192
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:11,375
W-whatta ya think's
gonna happen to us?

193
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:12,791
Settle down, 'Moru.

194
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:14,666
We gonna be just fine...

195
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:17,291
I hope Shoko and Maya...

196
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:19,250
...that they are doing alright.

197
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:28,208
What on earth
is happening here?]

198
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:29,958
H-e-y!

199
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:32,916
The only place that's really
safe is inside the shelter!

200
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,125
Alvis can't protect
you out here!

201
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:36,416
What's Alvis??

202
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,041
Come on, we'd better hurry.

203
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:39,333
Mm-hm.

204
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:44,750
It's happening again!

205
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:53,000
No way...

206
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:55,083
Why??

207
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:14,625
Target just took out the

208
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:17,250
Automated Defense
System at Mukojima.

209
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:19,625
This doesn't look good.

210
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:21,333
Is waking these giants

211
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:24,875
the only way we're going
to be able to survive?

212
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:29,291
Plot Fafner's course to
the target and stand by!

213
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:30,833
Where's the pilot?

214
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:33,708
Currently being transported
to the hangar aboard Barnzveck.

215
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:37,333
Hey, are you alright?

216
00:15:37,416 --> 00:15:38,875
I'm fine...

217
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:41,250
I know what you're
going through right now,

218
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:43,625
my son was a Fafner pilot, too.

219
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:45,416
Just do your best.

220
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,666
That's all you can do.
Right?

221
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,041
Yeah.

222
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:58,291
Aagghh!!!

223
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,416
Barnzveck's signal
stopped transmitting

224
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,958
250 meters south of the
Tatsumiya terminal!

225
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:07,125
The pilot and one of his
support staff are missing!

226
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:08,583
The pilot?!?

227
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:11,375
The target is currently on
course for Fafner's hangar!

228
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:13,708
To destroy it before
it's activated!

229
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:16,375
Send out emergency
activation codes to all units!

230
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:19,333
Let's see if we can keep
this bastard away from Fafner!

231
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:28,541
System stand-by completed!

232
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:29,958
Fire EPM!

233
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:36,666
Target immobilized!

234
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:37,791
All right!

235
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:39,625
Father, I'm gonna
pilot Fafner myself!

236
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:41,250
Soshi...

237
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,125
...you have a unique ability...

238
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:46,125
...something no one else can do.

239
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:50,791
The Siegfried System,
you mean...

240
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:55,541
Can you do it,

241
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:57,458
Soshi?

242
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:00,458
Yes sir.

243
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:03,791
Takeru Island EPM power
grid depletion in two minutes.

244
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:06,041
What about Valkyrie's Rock Door?

245
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,875
There's still no response, sir.

246
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:08,916
Dammit!

247
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,666
Just as I thought...

248
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:14,750
Raise the antitank missile into
firing position immediately!

249
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:17,041
Last just one minute...

250
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:18,000
...even one second...

251
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:19,750
That's all I ask...

252
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:21,750
Makabe.

253
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:23,083
Is he ready?

254
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:26,416
Right now, he's the best
chance we've got, so...

255
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:29,125
...it's up to him.

256
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:37,291
Hey Soshi...

257
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:41,125
Where are we going?

258
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:42,916
Do Y'mind telling me?

259
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:52,125
To Paradise...

260
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:56,916
EPM output is dropping rapidly.

261
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:00,416
What's this?

262
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,791
This is Fafner.

263
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:03,166
Fafner...?

264
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:05,500
It's named after a legendary
giant who turned into a

265
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:08,000
dragon to protect
the treasures of the Gods.

266
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:10,125
It's a combat machine
specifically designed

267
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:12,166
for the upcoming
battle with Festom.

268
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:14,000
Using Fafner is the
only way to prevent

269
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:16,500
the aliens from using
their mind reading power.

270
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:17,708
Kazuki...

271
00:18:17,791 --> 00:18:19,708
I want you to use it
to protect the island.

272
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:21,750
Come on, that's impossible!

273
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:23,333
I can't do that!

274
00:18:23,416 --> 00:18:25,333
Yes!
You can!

275
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:26,583
Think ya don't know how?

276
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:28,541
Believe me, once you've
combined with Fafner

277
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:30,708
you'll know all ya need to know!

278
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:33,750
The only way to protect

279
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:36,333
this island is
to rely on Fafner.

280
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:40,041
If I could...

281
00:18:40,416 --> 00:18:42,375
I'd do it myself.

282
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:43,833
But...

283
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:47,958
...It's up to you now!--

284
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:50,291
You're the only
one who can do it!

285
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,041
I can, huh?

286
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:55,000
Soshi...
Y'really think so?

287
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:56,958
Think so?

288
00:18:57,041 --> 00:18:58,875
I know so!

289
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:03,791
This is it!

290
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:04,916
Fafner Mark Elf!

291
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,875
Complete all
preparations for lift-off!

292
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:08,583
Night Helle gate number eleven!

293
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:10,166
On stand-by!

294
00:19:11,458 --> 00:19:13,416
Starting Siegfried System!

295
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:15,458
Soshi!

296
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:17,208
I'm counting on you.

297
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:19,375
Right.
Understood.

298
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,250
Kazuki Makabe.

299
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:30,083
Yep...

300
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:31,250
...as expected.

301
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:32,750
I was right according to
the scan report--

302
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:34,791
You won't need to wear the suit.

303
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:39,125
What is it?
Is everything okay?

304
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:42,583
Oh yes.
Everything's just fine.

305
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:44,416
Good luck, Kazuki.

306
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,958
Thanks!

307
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:49,500
Kazuki.

308
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:50,833
Are you ready?

309
00:19:50,916 --> 00:19:51,750
Yeah.

310
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:53,750
I'm starting Nibelungen.

311
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:55,500
Nibelungen...

312
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:05,333
I know this...

313
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:10,041
I know this!

314
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:23,625
Spinal logarithmic
input completed.

315
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:25,583
Synergetic code
has been certified.

316
00:20:25,666 --> 00:20:27,208
Nibelungen start-up confirmed.

317
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:29,291
Connecting Siegfried System.

318
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:31,916
Fafner Mark Elf,
stand-by for lift-off.

319
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:34,833
What's the matter?

320
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:36,458
Problem in Hangar Three, sir.

321
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:39,166
We can't access the password
that arms the on-board weapons--

322
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:41,000
It's a bio-release key,
and without it we

323
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:42,958
have no way of getting
those weapons activated.

324
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:45,125
But that means Fafner
will be defenseless!

325
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:46,833
I'll be right there!

326
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:48,833
Makabe.

327
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:50,791
Take charge while I'm gone.

328
00:20:55,583 --> 00:20:56,708
Kazuki.

329
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:57,750
Kazuki!

330
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:03,041
Soshi?!?

331
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:03,958
Why are you here?

332
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:05,208
I'm connected directly to your

333
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:08,000
brain's visual and
auditory sensors.

334
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:09,875
When you're in Fafner
and I'm in Siegfried,

335
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:11,333
we can see and hear
each other because

336
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:12,916
of the sensory link
which is enabled

337
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,833
by the brain nerve cell capsule.

338
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:16,500
Since you don't
have the synergetic suit,

339
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:17,833
the connection isn't perfect,

340
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:19,708
but that can't be helped.

341
00:21:19,791 --> 00:21:20,958
The number one priority is

342
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:22,875
for you and Fafner
to unite so thoroughly

343
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:25,041
that the two of
you become one entity.

344
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:26,541
First you have
to open your eyes.

345
00:21:26,625 --> 00:21:27,875
They are!

346
00:21:27,958 --> 00:21:29,500
Fafner's eyes!

347
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:32,333
In here, his eyes are your eyes.

348
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:36,583
I can see!

349
00:21:37,791 --> 00:21:38,541
Let's go.

350
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:40,208
That bastard's almost here.

351
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:43,291
Night Herle Eleven,
open the gate!

352
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:46,583
Fafner Mark Elf!
Ready... Lift off!

353
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:50,958
And so begins our journey...

354
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:53,375
We don't know
how long it will take,

355
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:55,041
or if we'll survive it.

356
00:21:55,125 --> 00:21:57,041
But no matter what happens,

357
00:21:57,125 --> 00:22:00,333
we'll never stop fighting
to protect this island...

358
00:22:00,416 --> 00:22:02,208
Until its beauty is restored

359
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:05,750
and it becomes a
paradise once again.

361
00:23:34,083 --> 00:23:35,500
The beginning...

362
00:23:35,583 --> 00:23:37,083
It's a battle.

363
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:39,166
And a revelation.

364
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:41,375
Things are clearer now...

365
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:43,583
I...

366
00:23:43,666 --> 00:23:45,666

"Life."

Are you there?
