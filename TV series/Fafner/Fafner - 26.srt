1
00:01:08,875 --> 00:01:11,166
Kenji!
Try dodging!

2
00:01:17,916 --> 00:01:19,916
It's no use.

3
00:01:20,583 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm going to die...

4
00:01:22,083 --> 00:01:22,916
Don't give up!

5
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:23,500
Kenji!

6
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:24,375
Kenji!

7
00:02:02,291 --> 00:02:03,708
Tsubaki!

8
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:08,083
What...
This thing...

9
00:02:08,416 --> 00:02:10,541
What could this be?

10
00:02:10,916 --> 00:02:14,083
That Festum...
is pain!

11
00:02:14,166 --> 00:02:15,458
Tsubaki.

12
00:02:16,041 --> 00:02:18,125
It's okay.

13
00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:22,666
I'm ready... but...

14
00:02:23,916 --> 00:02:26,166
I'm scared.

15
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,500
It's okay Tsubaki.

16
00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:30,833
I'm really scared...

17
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:40,125
Take this!

18
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:42,625
Festum!

19
00:02:42,708 --> 00:02:43,958
Would you like to
know the name of the

20
00:02:44,041 --> 00:02:46,791
military tactic I taught you?

21
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:49,583
It is the war of attrition!

22
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:52,791
It is the tactic by
which to endure pain!

23
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,500
The pain that you
feel from fighting,

24
00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:03,166
it is the pain of existence!

25
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,458
It comes from
the fear of disappearing.

26
00:03:05,541 --> 00:03:07,208
Festum!

27
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,416
Chizuru.

28
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,916
What is it?

29
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,041
I want...
I want to stay here.

30
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,166
I want to stay
here with you guys.

31
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:25,583
Oh, Tsubaki!

32
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:30,583
I'm sorry...
I'm so sorry, Tsubaki.

33
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:33,458
Mom.

34
00:03:42,708 --> 00:03:44,125
You can't escape...

35
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,291
The enemy's attack
rate is slowing.

36
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:56,791
Many of our units have already

37
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:58,125
broken through their
defensive lines.

38
00:03:58,208 --> 00:03:59,458
Push forward!

39
00:03:59,541 --> 00:04:01,333
We can't waste this
opportunity!

40
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:04,583
Keep advancing as
far as we possibly can!

41
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:11,666
Thank you for everything.
Chizuru.

42
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:15,291
I get it.
I understand.

43
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:17,291
I'll be all right.

44
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:18,833
And this way...

45
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:21,666
I'll be able to
become the island.

46
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,541
Oh Tsubaki...

47
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,750
It's that time.

48
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:29,916
I'll be able to hold
all of you close.

49
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,666
Just like a mother would...

50
00:04:36,291 --> 00:04:38,000
To do that...

51
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:41,208
I'll become
one with the island.

52
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:51,375
I don't want this.

53
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:55,375
I just want to go back...
to when we were nothing!

54
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:57,625
Everyone!
Retreat now!

55
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:13,500
Do you want to
be glad to be alive...

56
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:15,708
Because that...

57
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:18,916
...that is the joy that
only comes from existing...

58
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,833
Festum.

59
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:31,625
This is it.
It's Point C.

60
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,541
We're here.

61
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:42,750
Maya, use your Lacing Cutter.

62
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:44,291
Roger that.

63
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:09,541
This data...

64
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:12,416
...humans and Festum will now
be able to co-exist...??

65
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,291
Which means...

66
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:14,375
There's too much of it.

67
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:16,041
What if it overloads
our systems?

68
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:17,416
No.

69
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,666
Most of it is being
transferred to somewhere else.

70
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:21,916
And it's...

71
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,333
...Tatsumiya island.

72
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:38,541
My Mom...

73
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:40,666
Incoming data.

74
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:43,166
The Alvis servers and Urd's Well
are automatically receiving it.

75
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:44,625
It's being sent
from the North Pole.

76
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:46,458
Look at the size of that thing.

77
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:50,833
The data far exceeds any amount
we've ever received before.

78
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:57,750
They have reached Akane's core.
So now, they can have hope.

79
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:00,750
As can I.

80
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,250
The course is clear.

81
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:04,375
All systems are greenlit to go.

82
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:06,000
Something's updating our system.

83
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:08,875
It's navigational info coming
from somewhere near the target.

84
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:11,375
Do you think it's
possible that it's from...?

85
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:13,291
Akane Makabe...

86
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:16,000
A long time ago, when
most of us had lost hope,

87
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:18,875
she was the one
who reminded us to live.

88
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:33,250
Somewhere inside here...
Is where we'll find Soshi.

89
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:42,416
Oh Kazuki...

90
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:50,333
Soshi...

91
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:54,250
Kazu... ki...

92
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:57,666
They're here!

93
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:02,708
You won't get by...

94
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:05,041
...no matter what.

95
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:22,041
We're about to begin the
core's re-synchronization.

96
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,666
Oh Tsubaki...

97
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:37,291
You're not getting by me!
Am I being clear?

98
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:42,791
The lives you took away...
we want you to give them back.

99
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:02,583
No.

100
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:06,250
Kazuki...
Don't resist it...

101
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:11,625
Alright then.
I am you.

102
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:13,833
And you are...

103
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:15,791
...me.

104
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:32,166
The pulse of the enemy's MIR...

105
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:34,666
Yes Kazuki...

106
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:38,416
...you've assimilated
with the enemy's will.

107
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:43,500
That's right.
Acceptance is a kind of power.

108
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:55,416
Kazuki...

109
00:09:57,041 --> 00:10:01,166
Thank you... Everyone...

110
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,208
Tsubaki...

111
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:18,291
Soshi.

112
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:21,666
Are you still in there?
Soshi!

113
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,333
Kazuki.

114
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:25,375
Soshi!

115
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:28,833
You're really here...
aren't you?!

116
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:30,416
Yeah...

117
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:34,583
I'm not gone yet.
I'm still here.

118
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:37,291
Thank goodness!

119
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:38,750
Soshi.

120
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:41,000
He's alive...

121
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:47,416
Kazuki, what's the matter?

122
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,500
My eyes...

123
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:50,083
His body is reacting that way

124
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:53,166
because he's already
been assimilated.

125
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,708
It can't be.

126
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:56,083
He'll be all right...

127
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:58,583
I'm sure it'll go away when
he receives treatment.

128
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:02,250
Let's go back...

129
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:03,708
...back home...

130
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:05,708
Kazuki.

131
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:09,791
What is going on now?

132
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:14,000
The MIR...
it's started to move...

133
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:49,000
Fire!
Do it now!

134
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:55,583
The enemy's right
in front of us!

135
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:07,666
Oh Tsubaki...

136
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:10,833
The final assimilation
is about to begin.

137
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:17,083
Oh no...

138
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:18,666
Tsubaki!

139
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:33,708
Is that it?

140
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:36,666
That's the enemy's MIR.

141
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,833
It's trying to
link to the sky...

142
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:40,625
It plans to cover the
whole earth with Festum

143
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:43,208
by invading us from the
outer atmosphere.

144
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:44,708
We still have some time.

145
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:47,000
Assimilate with Mark Sieben's
weapon and shoot it down.

146
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:48,625
I understand.

147
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:51,458
Maya...
you'll pull the trigger.

148
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:53,208
Roger that.

149
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,875
Release Mark Sein's energy when
it reaches it's maximum level.

150
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:08,333
You only have one shot.

151
00:13:08,416 --> 00:13:11,083
Kazuki's body won't
last longer than that.

152
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,875
Because after all... To them,

153
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:18,708
that might have been the
only hope that they ever had.

154
00:13:18,791 --> 00:13:22,083
Even if so...
it is not the last hope.

155
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:24,125
Tsubaki...

156
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:47,375
That MIR and I...
we are the same.

157
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:49,666
To show that life and death,

158
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:53,916
existence and nothing
continue as one...

159
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,083
...we were born into this world.

160
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,958
Tsubaki?

161
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:04,208
Did you go back?
Are you with the other MIR?

162
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:07,333
Tsubaki...

163
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:14,750
I just can't believe it.
The Festum are falling.

164
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:17,125
Mr. Mizoguchi.

165
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:20,750
The Fafner team
has just reported in.

166
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:21,583
Everyone is safe.

167
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:23,416
They really pulled it off.

168
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,375
Those kids actually
managed to do it.

169
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:38,375
It's wind.
Down here?

170
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:39,708
It's the core.

171
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:42,958
She has now become
one with the island.

172
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:46,291
A breeze...

173
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:53,666
I am not gone...
I am here...

174
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:01,208
Good work, everyone!

175
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:03,333
We'll be home
before you know it.

176
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:06,791
Kazuki!

177
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,416
It's the Mark Nicht!

178
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,333
I see.

179
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:16,041
Upon dying the MIR gave the
Festum a physical body.

180
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,750
At this rate, everyone
will be sucked into it.

181
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:20,583
Kazuki!

182
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:22,000
Right!

183
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,333
Kazuki, no!

184
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:25,666
Maya!

185
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:30,375
Maya, stay back!

186
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:35,375
Don't worry...
I'll make it back.

187
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:37,791
No!

188
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:40,333
Kazuki... don't!

189
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:43,500
Calm down!
The crossing is still in effect.

190
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:45,125
If any one of us died,

191
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:47,750
we wouldn't be able
to communicate.

192
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:48,833
Remember?

193
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:50,041
You were the one
who told us about that

194
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:52,041
before we went into
the battle, Maya.

195
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:53,875
Which means...

196
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:56,708
Kazuki...
he's still alive.

197
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,208
I don't exist anywhere...

198
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:09,041
Yet I am here.

199
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:10,916
Existence and oblivion.

200
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,375
They are two sides
of the same coin.

201
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:17,083
I am nowhere...
And I am here.

202
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:19,958
Kazuki... Soshi.

203
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:25,708
This...
It's the Festum's blessing.

204
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:29,083
It returns everything
to nothingness.

205
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:31,458
It makes you
wonder what reality is.

206
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:35,625
Perhaps we no longer exist
out there in the real world.

207
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:39,916
Kazuki.

208
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,416
But it's... too soon.
We still...

209
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,791
We still exist!

210
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:48,416
Kazuki.

211
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:51,125
Soshi!
We're here!

212
00:16:57,375 --> 00:16:58,666
--Koyo!
--Koyo!

213
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:18,333
I am... here!
I exist!

214
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:34,208
What's that?

215
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:36,416
Those are the space fleets
and the cores of the Festum

216
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,166
that were in the
outer atmosphere.

217
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:42,125
They are burning up
and falling from the sky.

218
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:45,291
Look, Kazuki.

219
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:48,125
Before it could take off,
the entire vessel was hit.

220
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:50,708
But the engine remains intact.

221
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:53,625
Try to assimilate with
the structure of the body.

222
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:56,166
I'll transfer over
the controls of the system.

223
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:59,666
Once we're in the air
I'll be able to pilot it.

224
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:02,291
Think you can fly...
Kazuki?

225
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:08,208
I can fly...
as long as we do it together.

226
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:10,916
Isn't that right?

227
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,208
What is that?

228
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:14,500
The MIR...

229
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:17,458
...it finally understood
the cycle of life.

230
00:18:17,541 --> 00:18:19,333
Is that, Tsubaki?

231
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:20,416
No.

232
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,958
The same person
can't just be reborn.

233
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:25,708
If you could we would just be
identical copies of each other.

234
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:29,541
And we would lose all the
essential qualities of life.

235
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:31,875
So the being we knew as Tsubaki,

236
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:34,500
is being reborn
into something new.

237
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:37,916
Eventually, it will
grow up to be the core.

238
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,541
And I'm sure we'll be able to
have conversations with it.

239
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:44,250
As long as we
keep this island here...

240
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:46,916
...as a source of hope.

241
00:18:52,791 --> 00:18:56,583
Continue on your current course,
and you'll hit the island.

242
00:18:57,791 --> 00:18:59,541
You know,
when it came down to it.

243
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:02,208
You still saved me
in the very end.

244
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:04,166
Kazuki...

245
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:08,208
I taught the Festum about
pain and about existing.

246
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:12,083
And in the process...
I learned their blessing.

247
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,416
It was the cycle of
existence and nothingness.

248
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:18,375
The cycle of existence
and nothingness?

249
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:20,875
What are you talking about?

250
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:25,666
My body...
most of it is already gone...

251
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:27,250
Kazuki.

252
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:28,666
No!
Don't say that!

253
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,166
Once we get back to the island

254
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:31,750
I'm sure they can
do something.

255
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:35,458
You go on without me, Kazuki.

256
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:38,250
In a very short while...
I'll disappear.

257
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:40,083
Soshi!
What are you talking about?

258
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:42,000
Don't be like this, Soshi!

259
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:43,250
It will be alright.

260
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:45,625
I am going to return to
the Festum's side.

261
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:50,125
And from there, I will once
again create a life for myself.

262
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:53,458
I have no idea how
long this will take me.

263
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:56,125
But I will do it.

264
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,875
Soshi!
You're still here, right?

265
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:03,791
You're still there, aren't you?!

266
00:20:03,875 --> 00:20:05,041
Soshi.

267
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:07,750
Soshi!

268
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:15,791
I'm still right here.
Until we meet again.

269
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:17,541
Goodbye friend.

270
00:20:22,958 --> 00:20:28,333
Soshi!

271
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,833
Mark Sieben's all patched up.
It's prepared for take off.

272
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:44,166
Understood.

273
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:47,416
The pilot's mental condition
has also stabilized.

274
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:50,958
He's here!

275
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:52,750
Open the Number
seven Night Helle.

276
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:54,125
Do it now!

277
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:56,208
Fafner Mark Sieben you
are all cleared for takeoff!

278
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:17,208
♪ closing song ♪

279
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,750
Soshi...

280
00:22:04,291 --> 00:22:06,333
I will stay here.

281
00:22:07,583 --> 00:22:11,458
I will wait for
you... right here...

282
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:14,166
...forever.

283
00:23:06,708 --> 00:23:09,291
I understand now.

284
00:23:09,375 --> 00:23:12,416
Even though life
is filled with pain,

285
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:17,208
I can endure it and
I will choose to exist.

286
00:23:17,291 --> 00:23:22,375
I will do it all again..
in order to see you once more.

287
00:23:22,458 --> 00:23:27,333
As long as you believe in me...
I will return to you someday...

288
00:23:27,666 --> 00:23:30,541
No matter what.
