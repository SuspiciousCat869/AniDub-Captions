1
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,958
♪ opening song ♪

2
00:01:49,083 --> 00:01:50,416
How wonderful...

3
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,958
Now I can create a real
machine for our final showdown.

4
00:01:53,041 --> 00:01:56,000
Something different than
that machine Yoji wasted.

5
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:58,208
You are being too
soft if you ask me.

6
00:01:58,291 --> 00:02:00,041
Besides how will
you be able to take in

7
00:02:00,125 --> 00:02:02,416
all those abandoned soldiers.

8
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,000
They wanted to join us.

9
00:02:04,083 --> 00:02:06,083
So why should I kick them out?

10
00:02:06,166 --> 00:02:07,291
Are you sure you
won't change your

11
00:02:07,375 --> 00:02:09,333
mind about how
you're handling that pilot?

12
00:02:09,416 --> 00:02:10,458
Yes.

13
00:02:10,541 --> 00:02:12,916
Tsubaki Minashiro
prefers it that way.

14
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,083
Oh.

15
00:02:14,166 --> 00:02:15,916
Then you really
can't refuse it, can you?

16
00:02:16,583 --> 00:02:17,750
All right class,

17
00:02:17,833 --> 00:02:20,083
I'd like to introduce
you all to a new friend.

18
00:02:20,166 --> 00:02:21,750
I'm Tsubaki Minashiro.

19
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:24,000
Hi.
Nice to meet you.

20
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:27,083
Canon Memphis.

21
00:02:27,166 --> 00:02:29,500
Machine I.D.
Code JO17.

22
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:31,625
I pilot Babylon Model Fafners.

23
00:02:31,708 --> 00:02:34,750
You can go ahead and take
that empty seat over there.

24
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:41,458
Just to clarify, I turned that

25
00:02:41,541 --> 00:02:43,416
switch off as a
strategic decision.

26
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,458
It was not because you
persuaded me in any way.

27
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:48,583
No need to worry,
I'm in charge and

28
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:50,791
I'll be taking very
good care of you.

29
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:54,291
First I'll need you to choose
whatever you like from these.

30
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,291
I'm sorry ma'am.
I can't make tofu.

31
00:02:57,375 --> 00:02:58,541
I don't know how.

32
00:02:58,625 --> 00:03:00,125
That's precisely what
you're going to learn.

33
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:02,916
The only thing that any of you
have ever learned about was war.

34
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,791
So it's time I taught
you what peace is.

35
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,250
Hello, anyone home?

36
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:10,208
Is that Maya's voice?

37
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:13,208
My father used
to make me help with

38
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:15,625
the yard work when I was a kid.

39
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:16,875
When we were halfway done with

40
00:03:16,958 --> 00:03:18,875
cutting the grass,
we'd get to take a break.

41
00:03:18,958 --> 00:03:20,125
Mom would make barely tea and

42
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:22,833
we'd sit here
and drink it like this.

43
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:28,875
You know...
I got to meet your dad.

44
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:30,875
I just wanted to tell you that.

45
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:32,375
I know.

46
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:34,708
And I heard you were there
for him during his last moments.

47
00:03:34,791 --> 00:03:36,083
Yeah but...

48
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:38,500
I couldn't really
do anything for him.

49
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:40,541
All I did was watch...

50
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:42,416
I'm sorry.

51
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:47,458
But because of you he had the
opportunity to talk to someone

52
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:49,291
from the island before he left.

53
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:50,375
So, thank you.

54
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:52,500
I know that made him happy.

55
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:58,625
You can't!

56
00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:00,625
I don't see anything
wrong with living together!

57
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:02,250
How do you think
people will react to it?

58
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:04,041
Will you think things
through for once?

59
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:05,541
I have thought about it!

60
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:07,791
And aren't you taking the
children to the beach tomorrow?

61
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:10,041
How can you do this
and still be their leader?

62
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:11,208
I've had enough.

63
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:13,208
I'm leaving whether
you like it or not.

64
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:16,500
I want to entrust you with a new
resident, if that's all right.

65
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:18,166
I don't understand.

66
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:19,500
Why me?

67
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,791
I mean...
I know how you feel.

68
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:23,500
But you're the most qualified.

69
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:24,958
So please.

70
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:30,666
I'm requesting
leave superior officer.

71
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,791
I'm not your superior officer.

72
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:34,333
I'm your guardian, Canon.

73
00:04:34,416 --> 00:04:35,666
Understand?

74
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:38,166
I'd like permission
to leave to go

75
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,458
exchange information
with Triple Six.

76
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:41,291
Huh?

77
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:42,958
Oh, you mean Michio.

78
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:45,375
Just make sure you come
back before it gets dark.

79
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:46,208
Roger.

80
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:48,541
I will return before sunset.

81
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:50,333
You know, Canon.
In these situations,

82
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:51,875
you can just say "I'm leaving."

83
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:52,750
Hm?

84
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:53,875
Okay...

85
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:55,208
I'm leaving.

86
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:56,291
That's better.

87
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:57,500
I'll see you later then.

88
00:04:57,583 --> 00:04:59,208
Have fun.

89
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:04,500
I'm most qualified for this?

90
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:07,416
Everywhere I went
the situation was awful.

91
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,208
I fought the Festum just
because they were there.

92
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:11,458
In that sense,

93
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:13,750
I was no different from
the Festum I suppose.

94
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:18,375
What took you so long, Yumiko?

95
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:20,000
What? Sis!

96
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:21,500
What's in those bags?

97
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:24,166
Starting today I'm going
to be living here.

98
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:24,916
What?

99
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,958
You can't!

100
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:27,500
Who's going to
cook back at home?

101
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:28,666
Silly.

102
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,250
You're gonna be
taking over for me.

103
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:31,375
Huh?

104
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:33,125
Whaaaat?!!

105
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:41,125
She still has this picture...

106
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:51,458
Oh Yumiko...

107
00:05:51,541 --> 00:05:53,583
What is it that you've done?

108
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:59,125
Why is sis being such an idiot. 
Huh?

109
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:00,208
Do you know if Triple Six

110
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:01,875
is going to live
with that woman?

111
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:03,583
Uh, yeah.

112
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:05,250
At least it looks that way.

113
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:07,166
By the way,
where are you living?

114
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,666
I am currently residing
with Yoko Hazama.

115
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:10,500
Hmn?

116
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:11,958
Are you using Shoko's room?

117
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:13,250
Shoko?

118
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:14,583
Who's Shoko?

119
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:15,375
Uh...

120
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:16,958
Oh, Shoko was...

121
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:18,791
Ms. Hazama's daughter.

122
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:20,166
Oh, I see.

123
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:21,833
No, I'm not staying
in her old room,

124
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:23,875
they have me
in a different room.

125
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,625
Canon, if you
don't mind me asking,

126
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:28,416
where did you meet Michio?

127
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,625
Dublin.
Five years ago.

128
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:35,791
He rescued me.
He is an excellent superior.

129
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:37,875
He taught me how to fight.

130
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:42,375
You know what?

131
00:06:42,458 --> 00:06:43,458
I live really close.

132
00:06:43,541 --> 00:06:45,625
Do you wanna
come over for a visit?

133
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:47,708
Are you ordering me to go?

134
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:51,541
I thought it might be nice.
That's all.

135
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:52,666
Dad...

136
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,750
I want to start
fighting by myself...

137
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:56,416
...going on solo missions.

138
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,875
I guess leaving the island
made you a bit cocky, didn't it.

139
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:00,333
It's nothing like that.

140
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:01,541
It's just...

141
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:04,291
I don't want anyone else...
to die anymore.

142
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:07,000
What about if you die?
Is that okay?

143
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:09,000
And Soshi?
What about him?

144
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:11,208
Don't you think he
feels the same way?

145
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:14,083
Look...
You are not alone in this.

146
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:16,958
And that's the reason why
you cannot fight alone.

147
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:20,625
Now hurry up and
eat before it gets cold.

148
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:22,333
I cooked all of this for us.
You know.

149
00:07:22,416 --> 00:07:24,833
I cooked a few meals
myself too, back in the day.

150
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:27,375
But it was before you
got married, wasn't it?

151
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,708
I won't forget your pain...

152
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,541
None of it.

153
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:42,291
Huh? I thought
I packed it in here.

154
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:44,083
What is it you're looking for?

155
00:07:44,708 --> 00:07:47,416
It's this picture...
of my family...

156
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:49,375
Hey wait...

157
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:51,916
You're really, here aren't you?

158
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:53,625
I am...

159
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:55,208
And you are too.

160
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:57,625
We're both here.

161
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:03,375
Think of it as a peace talk to

162
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:05,666
make up for our
military's stupidities.

163
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:08,625
I'll even tell you what
the Neo U.N. is planning.

164
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:10,708
I'm only allowing
you to come onboard.

165
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:11,958
And even then,

166
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:14,166
only for a maximum
stay of forty-eight hours.

167
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:16,208
All right, however
I expect to be able to

168
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:18,791
visit with my daughters
as any father would.

169
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:21,375
That guy always acts
like he's such a big shot.

170
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:23,166
What do you think
he really wants from us?

171
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,666
I have no idea.

172
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:27,125
He's not exactly the type of
man, to be very forthcoming.

173
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:28,875
I want to make
sure I'm there tomorrow.

174
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:30,000
But aren't you supposed
to be going to the

175
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:31,625
beach with all the other pilots?

176
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:33,541
Now is not the time for that.

177
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:35,166
Actually, you should
be treasuring every

178
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:36,583
single moment you have to spend

179
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:38,750
with your friends
at a time like this.

180
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:43,041
Yes, I understand.

181
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:44,541
Good bye.

182
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:45,750
Was it a patient?

183
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:47,666
No. I just had some
business to attend to.

184
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:48,583
What've you got there?

185
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:49,625
It's Dad's camera.

186
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:50,875
I dug it up because
I want to take

187
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:52,583
some pictures at
the beach tomorrow.

188
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:54,125
I see...

189
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:55,458
If you happen
to see your sister,

190
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:57,333
will you let her know
I need to talk to her?

191
00:08:57,416 --> 00:08:58,500
Huh?

192
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:00,791
I received an order informing

193
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:02,791
all pilots to
gather at the beach.

194
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,583
Is that what
you're going to wear?

195
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:06,083
Hold on a minute.

196
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:08,041
I may have more comfortable
clothes that would fit you.

197
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:10,000
Do you mean Shoko's clothes?

198
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:12,916
Yeah...

199
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:15,541
She was still fairly weak and
couldn't go outside much.

200
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:17,375
That's why they're
still in good condition.

201
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:20,166
It would make me happy
if you would wear them for me.

202
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:22,041
No, thank you.

203
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:23,500
I don't think they'd fit.

204
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:24,791
I'm sure they would be fine.

205
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:26,041
Don't worry.

206
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:28,500
We're here at the
ocean not just for our

207
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:30,791
mental and physical health,
but so that we can

208
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:33,083
better communicate
among ourselves.

209
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:35,750
I want you to have a good time,
but be sure to be safe.

210
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:37,375
--We will!
--We will!

211
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:39,583
Oh...

212
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:41,166
Mom says to tell you
she needs to talk to you...

213
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,083
Why can't she
just leave me alone?

214
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:45,583
By the way, you better work
on those cooking skills soon,

215
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:47,666
or else Kazuki's
gonna make fun of you.

216
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:50,416
How does this have
anything to do with Kazuki?

217
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:54,000
That island is part of
Takeru Island's docking bay.

218
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:56,208
It's about one kilometer
here and back.

219
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,291
Think you can swim it?

220
00:09:58,375 --> 00:09:59,333
Sure.

221
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:00,875
Alright then,
and if you beat me,

222
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:03,000
I'll forgive you for leaving
the island without permission.

223
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:04,666
Are you still mad about that?

224
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,291
Are you gonna
do this thing or not?!

225
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:07,500
Let's do it.

226
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:08,833
Sounds pretty interesting.

227
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:10,166
Why don't you
let me join you two.

228
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:11,125
Sakura.

229
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:12,333
Tell you what.

230
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:14,125
How about if I win,
then you have to let the

231
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:15,958
Mark Drei
launch the next offensive.

232
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:17,541
That's fine by me.

233
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:18,916
Kazuki.

234
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,083
Don't forget, you're not the
only one who's a pilot?

235
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:23,750
Then here we go.

236
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,000
I'll teach you a thing or
two about beach volleyball.

237
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:29,083
You ready, Mamoru?

238
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:31,250
Of course!
Bring it on!

239
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:46,083
Oh, hey Maya...

240
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:48,125
I didn't know you were swimming.

241
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:49,250
Yeah, I was.

242
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:51,791
And Soshi and Sakura
were with me too.

243
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:55,000
I couldn't catch up with him.

244
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:55,916
He was too fast.

245
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Yeah, me neither.

246
00:10:57,083 --> 00:10:59,291
I can't believe
how much stamina he has.

247
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:04,375
Shoko.

248
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,250
Canon?

249
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,125
Where did you come
up with those clothes?

250
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:10,541
From Yoko Hazama.

251
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:12,291
She wanted me to wear them.

252
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:14,291
You mean Shoko's
mom gave them to you?

253
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:16,416
Uh, I think I better
go and change.

254
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,625
They look good on you, Canon.

255
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,500
You should be
in this picture too.

256
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:25,458
Okay, what's four minus one?

257
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:26,958
--Three!
--Three!

258
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:47,416
You've really grown, Maya.

259
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,333
Just look at you.

260
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:51,416
Why would he divulge the

261
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,791
Neo U.N.'s strategies
to us like that?

262
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:56,041
What do you think
it is that he's up to?

263
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:57,833
Commander Makabe.

264
00:11:57,916 --> 00:12:00,166
I need to talk to
you about something.

265
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:01,416
I see...

266
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,750
So you got to see what's
beyond the island too.

267
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:04,791
Yeah.

268
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:06,416
Did you go out in a Fafner?

269
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:10,208
Uh-uh. I'm not allowed to ride
one because I'm not qualified.

270
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:11,791
That seems rather strange.

271
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:13,125
You should have that verified.

272
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:14,333
Ask your mother.

273
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:15,416
You never know.

274
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,625
There's a chance
the data could be wrong.

275
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:23,416
Mom!

276
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:26,291
What is that man doing
back on this island?

277
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:28,208
What are you showing him?

278
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:29,541
What is that?

279
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:32,708
The real results of Maya's
pilot aptitude tests.

280
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:36,208
Then Maya's ability is
actually really high, isn't it?

281
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:37,333
I'm sorry.

282
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:38,500
But I...

283
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:40,333
So that's what happened...

284
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:42,000
What you did was wrong.

285
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:43,541
But I really ought to
be thanking you,

286
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:46,416
since your little secret
actually works to my advantage.

287
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,500
What did you come back for?

288
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:49,041
Is that any way
to talk to your father?

289
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:51,125
Get out! Can't you
see no one wants you...

290
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:52,583
Stop it!

291
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:54,458
I'd listen to her if I were you!

292
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:56,666
You haven't changed
one bit, have you?

293
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:59,291
I just discovered that
they've falsified data.

294
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:01,208
That is a very serious crime.

295
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:04,125
Expel them from the island.
You have no choice.

296
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:07,083
Turn them over to me.
I can handle them from now on.

297
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:09,000
That's what you
wanted all along, isn't it?

298
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:10,875
The commission
will conduct an inquiry.

299
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:13,208
And they'll determine
the punishment if necessary.

300
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:16,208
It'll be impossible for you
to try to stage a cover up.

301
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:19,333
I've already talked to Maya.
She'll no doubt have questions.

302
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:22,166
It's nice to have
a family, isn't it...

303
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:23,916
Fumihiko?

304
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:26,458
Suppose you knew
a certain someone who

305
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:28,708
actually had the
ability to pilot a Fafner.

306
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:29,916
But they had their records

307
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,250
altered in order to
protect them...

308
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:34,000
...what would you do, Soshi?

309
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:36,875
Covering up or falsifying
records is a serious crime.

310
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:38,458
But whether or not
to bring charges

311
00:13:38,541 --> 00:13:40,458
depends on the situation.

312
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:43,875
I knew you were
going to say that.

313
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:45,041
All right then.

314
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:47,541
I'm going to let
you in on something.

315
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:51,791
If something should
happen to me,

316
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:53,416
I want you to take my place.

317
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,250
Don't talk like that.

318
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:58,250
It's imperative that
Dr. Tohmi stays on the island.

319
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:00,041
We can't allow
him to take her away.

320
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:01,958
I'd sooner leave the
island than let her go.

321
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:05,250
I've been outside the
island I can survive there.

322
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:14,416
This investigative
committee demands to

323
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,583
know the details about
the discrepancies between

324
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:18,291
the recently discovered data and

325
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:20,708
the current data
that we have on file.

326
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:23,041
Since this is
a military tribunal,

327
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:25,750
understand that your right
to silence is not protected.

328
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:27,958
After the inquiry,
if the data in question is

329
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:29,291
verified as the original,

330
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:31,333
you will be charged
as the prime suspect.

331
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:33,166
Is this all clear to you?

332
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,708
It is.

333
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:38,291
Then let the accuser step forth
and enter in his statement.

334
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,166
Are you going
to sit there and let

335
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:43,250
your mother take
responsibility for your crime?

336
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:44,958
How disappointing.

337
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:46,375
--What a bastard!
--Unbelieveable!

338
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:48,041
It's okay, Dad.

339
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:50,208
Did you actually
think that Maya would

340
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:52,666
be grateful to you
for doing this to her?

341
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:57,625
I'm the one who did it...
I falsified the data.

342
00:14:57,708 --> 00:14:58,625
Yumiko!

343
00:14:58,708 --> 00:14:59,791
If I didn't say anything,

344
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:01,541
then you'd be
held responsible...

345
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:03,583
Madam Chairman,
she's reacting emotionally.

346
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:05,333
It's not the truth.

347
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:08,250
The suspects are obvious.

348
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:10,791
You might as well
begin the deliberation.

349
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:13,666
Have the commission
members made a decision?

350
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:16,333
Both will be
considered suspects.

351
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,125
We will move on to deliberation.

352
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:19,333
Just a minute.

353
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:20,791
According to this petition.

354
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:23,416
There are still a few people
that we haven't summoned.

355
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,916
What's this?

356
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
But I had only brought the
charges against the two of them.

357
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:29,083
We will question
the next defendant.

358
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:31,625
You may leave the
podium and take a seat.

359
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:33,333
Yes ma'am.

360
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:44,708
I falsified Maya Tohmi's
pilot aptitude records.

361
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:46,541
Before we will accept
your admission,

362
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:48,166
the commission
demands an explanation.

363
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:49,333
What was your motive?

364
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:50,791
I didn't want her to be a pilot.

365
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:53,375
She's too independent
which I consider a fatal flaw.

366
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:54,625
A flaw?

367
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:55,833
The fact that
she left the island

368
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:57,833
without permission
is testament to that.

369
00:15:57,916 --> 00:15:59,583
As a pilot she
would be a liability

370
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:01,041
and a danger to our objectives.

371
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:02,375
This has always
been evident from

372
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:04,708
her early childhood
interactions.

373
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:06,375
So therefore I made
the conscious decision

374
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:09,541
to falsify her data, removing
her from pilot candidacy.

375
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:10,875
Now we have three suspects.

376
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:13,125
Big deal.
The situation's the same!

377
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:14,208
We're not finished yet.

378
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:16,250
Please bring in
the next defendant.

379
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:18,000
--Mamoru?!
--Mamoru?!

380
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:18,875
It's true.

381
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:20,916
What can I say, I did it too.

382
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,333
As with the previous defendants,

383
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:24,708
we will need an
explanation for your motives.

384
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:26,708
Well I was hanging
out in the medical room,

385
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:28,375
messing around with
all the neat machines,

386
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:29,500
and the next thing I knew

387
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:31,541
I'd accidentally
rewrote Maya's data.

388
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:33,750
And I panicked
and tried to hide it.

389
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:35,208
That's our little troublemaker.

390
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:37,375
He's only just
a child after all.

391
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:38,416
I uh...

392
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,791
I don't think
that's the problem.

393
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:42,625
All right then, shall we
bring in the next defendant?

394
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:44,083
Sakura!

395
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:45,125
Yeah, me too.

396
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:46,833
I also falsified Maya's data.

397
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:49,583
I wanted to pilot a Fafner
more than anything else.

398
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:51,708
But Maya was standing in my way.

399
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:54,333
I know it was
wrong and I'm sorry Mom.

400
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:55,416
Sakura.

401
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,250
Okay.
Next defendant.

402
00:16:57,333 --> 00:16:58,083
It was really me.

403
00:16:58,166 --> 00:16:59,416
I did it!

404
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:02,708
I was terrified about
having to get on a Fafner.

405
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:05,083
I thought if I could just
lower my scores I'd be safe,

406
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:07,583
but it turns out I
lowered Maya's by mistake...

407
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:09,291
I'm sorry, Mom...

408
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:10,625
All right.

409
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:12,250
Bring in the next one.

410
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:15,666
I intentionally changed
the data in Maya's records.

411
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:18,458
This is weird.

412
00:17:18,541 --> 00:17:20,458
Who would order all of
them to do such a thing?

413
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:22,125
They weren't ordered.

414
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:24,291
Everyone's doing
it of their own will.

415
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:25,583
Of their own will?

416
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:27,291
Really?

417
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:29,625
Okay, and what
is your motive, Kazuki?

418
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:30,708
We'd like to hear it.

419
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:32,166
It's because...

420
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,916
...well, because I didn't
want Maya to have to fight.

421
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:34,625
Why?

422
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:35,458
Uh...

423
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:37,208
It's cuz I...

424
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:40,375
No reason.

425
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:42,166
Nothing really.

426
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:45,708
Aah, any excuse would've
been better than that.

427
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:47,125
All right, that's enough.

428
00:17:47,208 --> 00:17:48,791
I call the next defendant.

429
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:50,750
I'm next.
I also changed the data.

430
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:53,458
I think it'll be easier if you
just replied from there.

431
00:17:53,541 --> 00:17:55,208
You see I was simply
double checking what

432
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:59,000
her measurements were
when I made the mistake.

433
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:00,916
You can't always tell it!

434
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:03,916
Will you please take your seat!

435
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:05,708
Though it's unusual...

436
00:18:05,791 --> 00:18:07,833
...we have multiple
instances of fraud.

437
00:18:07,916 --> 00:18:09,833
And since there are so
many people involved,

438
00:18:09,916 --> 00:18:12,166
each person's crime holds
even less weight.

439
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:13,583
Ridiculous!

440
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:16,166
There's no evidence to back up
any of their statements.

441
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:18,083
The last defendant
called can verify that

442
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:20,166
all of our claims
have been true.

443
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:26,083
Tsubaki...?

444
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:27,958
Minashiro...?

445
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:29,750
The island core
is the defendant?

446
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:32,375
It's like putting God on trial.

447
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:33,708
It's the truth.

448
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:35,708
Everyone here
did alter the data.

449
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:37,958
In fact, I altered the data too.

450
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:41,083
Because I thought it would've
been too early for Maya.

451
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:41,791
Oh.

452
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:43,000
Is that so.

453
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:44,791
All of us know that
because of who she is,

454
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:46,666
my sister has an
infallible memory of

455
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,625
everything that
happens on the island.

456
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:51,250
It follows that she would know
about each individual's actions.

457
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:52,833
Nonsense!

458
00:18:52,916 --> 00:18:54,916
Even the core can falsify the
records in any way she wants.

459
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,041
Out of all of us, the core has
the greatest ability to be fair.

460
00:18:58,125 --> 00:19:00,000
How can anyone
doubt what she says?

461
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:01,583
After your mother
had been assimilated,

462
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:03,583
Chizuru Tohmi
ripped you from her womb.

463
00:19:03,666 --> 00:19:06,916
She's responsible for giving you
a life filled only with pain.

464
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,250
Why are you protecting her?

465
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:10,625
Because that was
the will of my mother.

466
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:12,666
I wasn't supposed
to exist like I do.

467
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:15,750
But thanks to Chizuru,
I'm here before you.

468
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:19,041
Both my mom and
I are grateful to Chizuru.

469
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:22,083
Don't you kids even know
a single thing about yourselves?

470
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:23,833
Why?
What is there to know?

471
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:25,750
The alien chromosomes
that were implanted

472
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:28,416
in your bodies increase
every time you get in a Fafner.

473
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,583
Eventually, it could
harm or even kill you.

474
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:31,875
Those elements are what allow

475
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:33,458
them to effectively
fight the Festum.

476
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:35,416
And the potential threats
are now minimal thanks

477
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,041
to Dr. Tohmi's research.

478
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:38,416
Unbelieveable!

479
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,916
You're actually still doing
such useless research?!

480
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:41,958
Useless, huh?

481
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:43,583
Yeah right.

482
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:44,750
Surely the
commission members aren't

483
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:46,416
going to believe these things!

484
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,958
What do you mean by that?

485
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:50,666
They are the products of
Japanese genetic engineering

486
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:52,333
created by a
desperate people who

487
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:54,500
lost their ability
to conceive that's all.

488
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:55,750
How dare you say that!

489
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:57,250
They are merely
batteries that fuel

490
00:19:57,333 --> 00:19:58,916
your precious
Fafners aren't they?

491
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,083
What did you say?!

492
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:02,875
Don't think you'll leave
here in one piece!

493
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:06,708
We're just batteries to them?

494
00:20:06,791 --> 00:20:07,791
Apparently so.

495
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:09,500
What a bastard.

496
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:11,458
Listen Maya...

497
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:13,791
The people on this island
have got it all wrong.

498
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:15,125
Why'd you do that?

499
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:17,833
Why did you talk about
my friends like that, Dad?

500
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:19,791
Because that
is the reality of it.

501
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:20,958
It was the truth.

502
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:23,083
But... Everyone
here loves their families.

503
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:25,083
And that's also
the truth, isn't it?

504
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:26,750
Your view is too narrow.

505
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:29,833
It isn't the same when you
look at the overall picture.

506
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,958
I'd been wondering
about something, Dad.

507
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:35,791
When Mr. Hino died,
did you feel sad?

508
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:37,625
He believed in
a ridiculous cause.

509
00:20:37,708 --> 00:20:39,791
And so he got what he deserved.

510
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:42,625
By the way...

511
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:45,333
I've been taking pictures
with your old camera.

512
00:20:45,416 --> 00:20:46,500
My camera?

513
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:47,875
That old thing?

514
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:49,708
I'll tell you what.
I'll get you a brand new camera.

515
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:52,333
One much better
than that old one I had.

516
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:54,208
I was wondering...

517
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:55,958
What is it?

518
00:20:56,333 --> 00:21:00,541
What's the difference...
between the Festum and you?

519
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:05,666
All right then.

520
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:08,458
If this commission has come
to a verdict, let's hear it.

521
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:09,625
This is a joke.

522
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:11,625
What kind of
ridiculous inquiry is this?

523
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:13,333
If any member wishes to make an

524
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:17,500
official charge against the
defendants, then please rise.

525
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:23,000
With no official charges
there are no suspects.

526
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:24,875
This inquiry is closed.

527
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:26,375
You may go.

528
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:29,916
Dad...

529
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:31,375
I've decided.

530
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:32,875
I'm going to stay here.

531
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,916
Be sure to use your head, Maya.

532
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,416
The people on
this island are just a

533
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:40,500
group of fools who cling to
their delusions of peace.

534
00:21:40,583 --> 00:21:41,708
Good-bye.

535
00:21:41,791 --> 00:21:43,416
Be safe, Dad.

536
00:21:44,791 --> 00:21:46,208
If you apologize to Maya,

537
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:48,666
I'll allow you stay
here a bit little longer.

538
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:51,541
The MIR in the North Pole
have started to become active,

539
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:54,375
which means the threat
to humanity will be great.

540
00:21:54,458 --> 00:21:56,833
At that time, you'll have
no choice but to fight.

541
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:58,291
Suppose we win the battle,

542
00:21:58,375 --> 00:22:00,250
have you thought about
what you'll be left with?

543
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:03,208
As long as we win, I
wouldn't require anything else.

544
00:22:03,291 --> 00:22:05,750
All of the information
I gave you is accurate.

545
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:07,125
Make sure you study it.

546
00:22:07,208 --> 00:22:09,583
It will show you how
ill-prepared we humans are for

547
00:22:09,666 --> 00:22:11,916
a full force attack
by the Festum.

548
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,541
Be sure to see
it with you own eyes.

549
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:18,541
You could say,
our situation is hopeless...

550
00:22:27,291 --> 00:22:30,375
Thank you Sis
for trying to protect me.

551
00:22:30,458 --> 00:22:32,625
I appreciate it.

I am going to fight as well.

554
00:23:41,666 --> 00:23:45,041
In my eyes is a reflection...

555
00:23:45,125 --> 00:23:47,875
...of a place
filled with battles.

556
