1
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,291
Initiating Fenrir.

2
00:00:17,083 --> 00:00:19,541
Split into two groups.
One will be on standby.

3
00:00:19,625 --> 00:00:21,916
The other will rescue the people
who're still underground.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,166
How are we supposed
to get to them?

5
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:24,083
Through the ocean.

6
00:00:24,166 --> 00:00:25,625
I'll go!

7
00:00:25,708 --> 00:00:28,208
I'm going to accomplish what
the two of you weren't able to!

8
00:00:28,791 --> 00:00:30,083
Soshi, you should at least check

9
00:00:30,166 --> 00:00:31,625
that there's no
enemy down there!

10
00:00:31,708 --> 00:00:34,291
He's never fought underwater
before, much less in the ocean!

11
00:00:34,375 --> 00:00:35,833
If he gets attacked there...

12
00:00:35,916 --> 00:00:39,333
Kazuki fighting them is going to
be your share of the duties.

13
00:00:43,375 --> 00:00:45,125
I'll get there soon...

14
00:00:45,208 --> 00:00:47,916
And when I do I'll
be ready to fight.

15
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:40,958
So, did I get it?

16
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:42,125
Here they come!

17
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:44,291
Hurry up and
load Gegner's energy.

18
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:45,916
What?

19
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,666
They're retreating?

20
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,791
What on earth is happening?

21
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:05,416
It's original shape has
been restored?!

22
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:32,166
I suppose this spot
here will just have to do.

23
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:35,166
Does that mean that
we're gonna be all right now?

24
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:38,375
Don't worry I think
we should be just fine.

25
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:59,333
Come on, budge!
You old piece of junk!

26
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,625
There's thirteen
minutes until Fenrir starts...

27
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:21,791
You need to stay hydrated.

28
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,375
But minors aren't allowed
to drink that stuff remember?

29
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:27,500
Drink it.
It's an order.

30
00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:43,541
Hey--Wait a minute,
it's just water.

31
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:45,625
All we can do now,

32
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:49,208
is simply leave our fate in
the hands of providence.

33
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:53,916
That must be it!

34
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:16,000
Hurry up, we're gonna
need to jump on it!

35
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:18,625
Confirming that there
are two on board.

36
00:05:18,708 --> 00:05:19,791
I'm counting on you.
Koyo.

37
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:22,208
I really did it.

38
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,250
No.
I can't wait.

39
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:56,083
Come on!
This way!

40
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:59,166
We've rescued the survivors.
Get out now, Kazuki!

41
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:01,250
What about Koyo?
Is he all right?

42
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:03,000
You should worry
about yourself right now!

43
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:06,041
I'm not gonna leave here without
Koyo, do you understand?

44
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:07,958
Kazuki!

45
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:13,000
We simply cannot afford
to lose any more Fafner!

46
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,208
Please understand.

47
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:23,041
You must try.

48
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:25,458
But Soshi I just...

49
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:33,916
Get out of there immediately!

50
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,625
No! Koyo!

51
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:06,708
I rescued them.
I know I did.

52
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:09,875
Kazuki.

53
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:20,833
Koyo! No!

54
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:25,208
Everything is
going to disappear.

55
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:34,083
I don't get it.

56
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:36,833
Why hasn't Fenrir
been activated?!

57
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:41,375
If I always did things on time,

58
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:43,833
I'd probably need another
life right about now.

59
00:07:43,916 --> 00:07:45,041
Mark Drei, listen!

60
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:46,833
You can still make it.
Hurry up!

61
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:49,541
You don't need to tell me.
I'm going as fast as I can.

62
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:52,916
I can do this too.
I know that I can.

63
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:03,333
Tell me...
the people I rescued...

64
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:05,541
...who were they?

65
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:08,291
It was Maya and Mr. Mizoguchi.

66
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:10,250
Maya...

67
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:14,791
Who is that?
I can't remember.

68
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,791
Why can't I remember?

69
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,958
Koyo.

70
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:27,333
I wonder...

71
00:08:27,416 --> 00:08:30,458
Is this what it's like
to be assimilated?

72
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:33,208
I don't feel anything...

73
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:36,500
I know deep down that
something sad happened...

74
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:38,875
That's right...

75
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,750
Someone named Shoko...

76
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:43,333
Rescue is on the way.
Hang in there.

77
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:45,500
That girl named Shoko...

78
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:54,583
Who was she anyway...

79
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:56,208
Koyo.

80
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:06,041
I've spotted Koyo!

81
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:15,583
Just hang on, Koyo!
I'm here to rescue you now.

82
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:38,916
I did it!
I recovered Mark Vier's cockpit!

83
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:59,666
The island has
completely vanished along

84
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:02,541
with the Alfenotheles
and Grendel types.

85
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:03,666
Seventeen members of the

86
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,375
scouting team are
unaccounted for.

87
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:07,291
And we've also lost one Fafner.

88
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:11,458
However we were able to
successfully rescue the pilot.

89
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:14,791
Maya is all right.

90
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:20,166
You must hurry.

91
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:23,041
See to the injured once
the convoy returns.

92
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:39,500
Oh, thank you so much, Sis.

93
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:42,583
You did a good job today Maya.

94
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:45,208
I don't know.

95
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:48,375
The truth is I really
didn't do anything.

96
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:52,416
And then there's Koyo too...

97
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,291
He's going to be
all right, isn't he?

98
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:57,375
Let's leave him in
Mom's capable hands.

99
00:10:57,458 --> 00:10:59,750
There's no need to worry.

100
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:02,500
I'm sure he'll
be showing us that

101
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:05,458
bright smile of his
again in no time.

102
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:38,958
Good morning.

103
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,333
I was so glad to hear you
weren't hurt Maya dear.

104
00:11:42,416 --> 00:11:44,458
I can't tell you how
good it is to see you.

105
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:47,958
Uh, someone told me that
she was here so I came over.

106
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:52,208
Yes. That's right and she's been
lifting our spirits up everyday.

107
00:11:58,041 --> 00:12:02,083
Regarding this case, I really
don't know what else to say...

108
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:04,166
What's done has
already been done.

109
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:06,083
So there's no need
to say anything else.

110
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:09,583
How pathetic.
He wasn't of any use after all.

111
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:19,625
He's nothing but a big zero!
Now this just goes to prove it!

112
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:28,000
He's nothing but a big zero!
Now this just goes to prove it!

113
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:30,250
Miss Kariya, did you
find the treasure you

114
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,416
were looking for on that island?

115
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:37,250
Because...
I sure as hell found it.

116
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:43,833
I must say I'm
surprised that you came

117
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:46,500
all the way over to my house.

118
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:49,708
Is this the treasure that
you were talking about?

119
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,500
The unit serving directly under

120
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,708
Miss Kariya had
possession of it.

121
00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:56,708
I'm sure she was going to
give it to the Neo U.N.

122
00:12:56,791 --> 00:12:59,375
So what are you gonna do then?

123
00:12:59,791 --> 00:13:02,250
Be honest for a second,
just how many of 'em

124
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:05,000
do you think there
are on the island?

125
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:07,208
I think that you should
hunt 'em all down at once.

126
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:11,041
We're dealing with humans here.
I'd like to show some prudence.

127
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:13,125
All right.
If you say so.

128
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:15,333
I know you wanna
let 'em remain free for now,

129
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:17,541
but if Kozo were here
he'd get rid of 'em.

130
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:20,541
I don't have any intention of
fighting against humans.

131
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:23,541
I know.
That's why I'm here.

132
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:25,458
Although, if you're
ever in danger,

133
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:27,875
I will do everything I
can to hunt them down.

134
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:30,541
Got it, Makabe?

135
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:38,708
Seriously!

136
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:40,208
They shouldn't make
us stay after school

137
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:42,083
if they want us to work.

138
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:45,000
You know, I noticed
something this morning.

139
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:47,166
Was the classroom
always this big?

140
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:50,166
Isn't it just because we have
fewer students right now?

141
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:53,166
Most of them were gone cuz they
had to work or were injured.

142
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:56,041
What I don't understand is why
they'd cancel the classes!

143
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:58,750
Aw man, I don't
understand these!

144
00:13:58,833 --> 00:13:59,833
Hey!

145
00:13:59,916 --> 00:14:02,291
Have you heard
anything new about Koyo?

146
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,875
I heard that he wasn't injured.

147
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:07,750
So I'm guessing that he's
just sleeping or something.

148
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:21,625
Do you think you guys could
run a little errand for me?

149
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:27,041
Maya!

150
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:30,250
Rina?

151
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:33,833
Will you be going to CDC today?

152
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:36,333
No, I'm actually going home.

153
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:37,750
Oh, I see.

154
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:39,791
I guess I'll be looking
forward to it next time then.

155
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:42,458
Huh? You'll be looking
forward to what?

156
00:14:42,541 --> 00:14:44,708
You mean you haven't heard yet?

157
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:47,250
I'm real sorry,
but I have to go now.

158
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:49,500
They told me to
get back right away.

159
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:51,291
I'll see you later.

160
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:53,500
I'll see you later.

161
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:55,791
There you are.
Maya!

162
00:14:56,291 --> 00:14:59,125
I'm really glad that
I finally found you here.

163
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:02,666
What do you guys want?

164
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,333
It's about Koyo.

165
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:07,166
I'm partly responsible
for what happened too.

166
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:08,541
Responsible?

167
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:10,708
It's not part of my
nature to ask a favor

168
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:13,083
from anyone but in this
case, it's a little different.

169
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:14,583
So then what do you want?

170
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:17,416
I was just wondering if you
would ask your mom for me,

171
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,458
if it was okay if
I went to see Koyo.

172
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:22,541
Yeah, sure!
I'll ask her for you.

173
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:26,500
Excuse me!

174
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:31,916
Would it be okay with you if
all of us went to visit Koyo?

175
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:37,250
What's the matter?
Did something bad happen?

176
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:41,000
I think that you should go.
It'll be a good lesson for you.

177
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:42,666
Hmn?

178
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:46,541
If you'll excuse me.

179
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:50,041
You sure about this, Yukie?

180
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:52,458
They need to know
what happens to people...

181
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:54,583
...after assimilation.

182
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:13,666
Hey, aren't you gonna
come and visit Koyo with us?

183
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:14,458
I'm not going.

184
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:16,041
Why not?

185
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:20,375
Is it because you feel partially
responsible for Koyo's injuries?

186
00:16:21,541 --> 00:16:25,583
If that's it, then you should
go visit him even more.

187
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:34,958
Now, come on, let's go
over there and see him.

188
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:37,916
Hey. Wait.
Let go of me.

189
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
There's no use fighting!

190
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:45,208
What's up with you?

191
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:46,708
Do you have a problem
with dogs or something?

192
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:49,083
Why did you bring a
dog with you here anyway?

193
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:52,833
Because she's so darn cute.
It's all right, isn't it, Sis?

194
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,250
Huh? Aren't we going
to the medical bloc?

195
00:16:58,333 --> 00:16:59,833
We're almost there.

196
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:08,916
You're kidding...
right?

197
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,416
I'm sorry...
but that's the reality.

198
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,583
Woof!

199
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:13,916
Chocolat!

200
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:19,791
Why did it have to be Koyo?

201
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:23,125
Why is he the only one
who became like this?

202
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,333
During the battle,

203
00:17:24,416 --> 00:17:27,250
his central nervous
system was assimilated.

204
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:28,666
Assimilated?

205
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,250
Those are their tactics.

206
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:33,000
They take away
everything from us.

207
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:35,208
Is it my fault?

208
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:36,791
It's because of me...

209
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:39,958
If only I had gotten to
the cockpit block sooner...

210
00:17:40,041 --> 00:17:41,208
That's...

211
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:44,291
Then...
it must be my fault too.

212
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:46,375
The reason that all this
happened was because

213
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:48,458
Koyo had to come to rescue us.

214
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:50,333
What happened is not your fault.

215
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:53,250
So there's no use in
blaming yourself for it.

216
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:56,708
This is a result of what
Koyo did to himself.

217
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,833
Thanks to him, we lost a Fafner.

218
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:03,791
So we don't have time
to be all sentimental.

219
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:10,708
How can you say
something like that!

220
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:16,333
You were the last person
Koyo was able to talk to.

221
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:18,500
The only one he had in the end.

222
00:18:18,583 --> 00:18:21,166
Are you really that heartless?

223
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:27,541
When does the next
foster child arrive?

224
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:30,666
Unfortunately we cannot
approve a new delivery.

225
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:33,833
But why not?
Koyo's practically dead already.

226
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:35,250
As I explained,

227
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:37,958
Koyo Kasugai is in a coma
due to semi-assimilation.

228
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:40,541
Therefore he is
considered to still be alive.

229
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:42,208
According to the
rules and regulations,

230
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:44,666
I'm unable to grant
you a new foster child.

231
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:47,375
You can't do this to us!
What are we supposed to do?

232
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:49,000
We'll forever be
labeled as the ones

233
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:50,625
who raised the loser
on this island.

234
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:52,500
We're not going
to stand for this!

235
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:54,791
The issue at hand
is not your reputation.

236
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:58,416
May I remind you
that your son is still alive.

237
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:25,166
What is it that
you think you're doing?

238
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:31,375
Our reputation is
in ruins because of him.

239
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:34,750
So isn't it only natural for us
to hope for a new child?

240
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:36,666
We don't want to be
looked down upon because of

241
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,875
this like how the Hazama
family is now.

242
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:40,541
Alberecht was
able to recognize

243
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:43,250
Ms. Hazama's dedication
and achievements.

244
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:45,458
But unfortunately, it's clear
that the two of you are...

245
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:47,750
Please, you must
apply to Alberecht

246
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:49,750
for another child on our behalf.

247
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:52,125
We promise to raise
an excellent pilot next time.

248
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:53,541
Please.

249
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,416
Ugh...

250
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:01,958
It has come to our
attention that you have

251
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:04,541
been leaking information
to the Neo U.N.

252
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:08,583
Regardless, you both ended
up raising one hell of a pilot,

253
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:09,875
and I must thank you.

254
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:11,666
However...

255
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:17,041
Your current attitude proves you
are not qualified to be parents!

256
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:20,541
I want you off of this
island immediately!

257
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:24,750
I should have done
this a long time ago.

258
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:43,375
Hey there, Maya.
How's it going?

259
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:46,875
Mr. Mizoguchi...
I thought this store was...

260
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:49,208
Starting today, I'm no
longer just a customer.

261
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:51,750
I've been promoted to owner.

262
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:02,541
I heard that Mr. and Mrs.
Kasugai left the island.

263
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:04,125
And it wasn't a way to make them

264
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:05,958
take the blame for
losing the Fafner.

265
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:07,750
It had to do
with something else.

266
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:11,375
Where are they going
to live in this time of war?

267
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:26,000
What's the use of
answering such a question?

268
00:21:29,541 --> 00:21:32,500
I just need to hear
the answer for myself.

269
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:37,083
Between a Fafner or us,
when it comes down to it,

270
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:39,708
which one is more
important to you?

271
00:21:42,541 --> 00:21:45,625
What answer do you
expect me to give?

272
00:21:56,666 --> 00:21:57,916
You're late, Maya.

273
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,875
You have to be sure to be
on time for your shifts.

274
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:01,375
I know.
I'm sorry.

275
00:22:01,458 --> 00:22:03,916
Looks like you
just lost a point.

276
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:07,000
What are you doing here?

277
00:22:07,083 --> 00:22:09,958
Why hello again Maya.
How's it going?

278
00:22:12,875 --> 00:22:15,791
There was something
I just couldn't lose.

279
00:22:16,166 --> 00:22:18,250
But in order to protect it,

280
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:21,791
I would have to sacrifice
the smaller things.

281
00:22:22,833 --> 00:22:26,083
I didn't know it at
the time, but it would

282
00:22:26,166 --> 00:22:28,708
lead to losing
everything in the end.

283
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:32,583
Yet I had to
keep protecting it...

284
00:22:33,708 --> 00:22:38,666
♪ closing song ♪

285
00:23:35,375 --> 00:23:40,541
I thought he understood.
That's what I believed.

286
00:23:41,125 --> 00:23:45,375
And likewise...
I thought I understood.

287
00:23:46,833 --> 00:23:51,333
But when it came to Kazuki,
I just couldn't...

288
00:23:52,958 --> 00:23:57,250
Next on Fafner
episode number 10,

289
00:23:57,333 --> 00:23:59,250
"Crossing Paths."

290
00:24:00,166 --> 00:24:01,625
Are you there?
