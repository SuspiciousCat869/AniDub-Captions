00:01:44,375 --> 00:01:46,958
Calm down, Michio!
They're only just kids.

3
00:01:47,041 --> 00:01:48,958
The next time either one of
you shoot one of our own,

4
00:01:49,041 --> 00:01:50,750
I'll treat you like
the enemy out there!

5
00:01:50,833 --> 00:01:53,333
Your actions were
reckless and foolish!

6
00:01:53,708 --> 00:01:55,583
That is quite enough.

7
00:01:55,666 --> 00:01:58,416
I can handle the
rest from here on out.

8
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,833
Hey!

9
00:02:01,916 --> 00:02:04,000
Thanks for being the
bad guy for all of us.

10
00:02:04,083 --> 00:02:05,333
They were actually
trying to protect

11
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:07,750
someone who'd already been
captured by the enemy.

12
00:02:07,833 --> 00:02:09,541
But the truth be told,
I wish I had a

13
00:02:09,625 --> 00:02:12,208
few more friends
like the two of them.

14
00:02:12,708 --> 00:02:14,791
Yeah.
Don't we all.

15
00:02:14,875 --> 00:02:16,375
I must confess...

16
00:02:16,458 --> 00:02:19,166
To defeat the enemy, I was
going to sacrifice the pilot.

17
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:20,583
It's okay.

18
00:02:20,666 --> 00:02:22,291
We've survived under those
same principles as well...

19
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:23,791
But at the same time we've been

20
00:02:23,875 --> 00:02:26,291
searching for a
different way to live.

21
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:29,250
I never considered that before.

22
00:02:35,708 --> 00:02:36,958
Kazuki.

23
00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:39,041
Have you heard
about Maya's results?

24
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:41,625
They should be
ready any minute now.

25
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,250
I'm all right...

26
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:46,166
I've prepared myself for this.

27
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,791
Are you sure Maya?

28
00:02:47,875 --> 00:02:50,125
Thank you for
telling me about it.

29
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:52,250
And not hiding it from me.

30
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:55,333
Listen Maya.

31
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:59,333
Mom will do whatever it
takes to protect all of you.

32
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:04,166
The better the pilot,
the faster they got assimilated,

33
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,750
at least I believe
that's the way it works.

34
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:09,666
I'd heard that those from your
generation had it the worst.

35
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,000
Is that true?

36
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:12,791
Well we really didn't have
any other ways to fight.

37
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:15,458
They died one after another.

38
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,958
It wasn't 'til after
I came to this island...

39
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:21,500
...that I even started
thinking about living my life.

40
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:23,250
That's how it was for me too.

41
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:24,375
Oh, is that so?

42
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:26,125
Hey, Kazuki.

43
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:27,375
We should probably
get going now.

44
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:29,625
But I thought we
were here to see Maya.

45
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:31,916
Let's give her
some time with her family.

46
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:33,625
I've just completed the routine

47
00:03:33,708 --> 00:03:36,208
updates of the
Brunhilde System...

48
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:37,458
With the core mobile,

49
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:39,500
we've collected a
ridiculous amount of data.

50
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:41,375
I wonder if she is
going to remain like

51
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:44,000
this or eventually return
to Valkyrie's Coagula.

52
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:46,875
The Commander ordered us to
let her do whatever she wants.

53
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:48,958
And as long as
Solomon remains quiet,

54
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:50,791
the core's really no
different from any other

55
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:52,875
normal human being
like you or me.

56
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:54,125
Now then!

57
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:55,958
Shouldn't we be heading
back to the school now?

58
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:59,208
Don't forget we have that
special meeting to attend today.

59
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:03,041
I'd like to present my report
on this year's U Project.

60
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:06,833
I compiled the most appropriate
elements from 1,500 customs.

61
00:04:06,916 --> 00:04:09,500
And I've come up with
the most feasible plan.

62
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:12,291
I also modified the
Bon festival dance a little.

63
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:15,500
You may refer to
the manual for details.

64
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:18,750
And the Spirit Lantern Ceremony
is scheduled at 2000 hrs.

65
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:20,500
And we'll be using
a low temperature

66
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:22,625
light source in the
paper lanterns.

67
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:24,208
They look no
different from candles,

68
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:28,708
but they'll burn for at least 49
hours at 60 degrees Celsius.

69
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:36,208
Sakura!

70
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:39,333
I have a confession
to make to you.

71
00:04:39,416 --> 00:04:41,125
I was prepared
to allow you to die,

72
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:43,500
in order to defeat the enemy.

73
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:46,083
I thought I was
gonna to die too.

74
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:48,375
I didn't have the
courage to blow myself

75
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:50,125
up in order to save my friends.

76
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:52,041
I thought I was
prepared to die as

77
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,833
long as it meant I
could avenge my father.

78
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:55,833
But I was wrong.

79
00:04:55,916 --> 00:04:59,375
I can't tell you
how glad I am to be alive.

80
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:02,125
I've never felt as
strongly as I do now.

81
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:03,916
And yet still...

82
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:06,416
I feel ashamed...

83
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:09,041
And I don't know
what I should do.

84
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:12,541
I wonder if I should've died.

85
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:14,333
If it would have
been better that way.

86
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:15,958
Don't say that!

87
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,375
I...

88
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:19,916
I had very specific
orders to kill anyone

89
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,791
who had been
captured by the enemy.

90
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:22,375
And...

91
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:24,041
Well I...

92
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:25,833
I'm glad I didn't
shoot you in the end.

93
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:27,916
But I would've done
it without hesitation.

94
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,416
And I feel bad for that.

95
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:33,750
Thanks, Canon.

96
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,625
I really envy you, Sakura.
You know that?

97
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:36,833
Huh?

98
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:38,833
Kenji and Mamoru
care so much for you.

99
00:05:38,916 --> 00:05:40,333
They would've done
anything to save you.

100
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:42,041
No!
It's not like that!

101
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:43,041
I mean...

102
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:44,416
Those guys are
a bunch of idiots.

103
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,916
Besides I'm sure they
would've done the same thing

104
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,458
for you too if you'd been
captured by the enemy out there.

105
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:50,125
You think so?

106
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,083
Yeah, I know so.

107
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:54,666
Because you're a friend now.

108
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:58,250
And if there's one thing those
two hate, it's losing a friend.

109
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:00,500
I'm really their friend?

110
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:02,000
Oh, there you are.

111
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:03,375
Hey, there!

112
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,625
What is it?
What do you want?

113
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:09,833
Uh...

114
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:11,583
Everyone's about to
make the paper lanterns.

115
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:13,125
You should come too Canon.

116
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:14,125
Are you sure?

117
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:15,791
Hey Canon...

118
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:19,125
I need to tell you
something, It's about...

119
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:21,500
You know when you...
what I mean is...

120
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:24,125
I think Kenji's trying to
apologize for shooting at you.

121
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:25,500
Yeah.
That's right.

122
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:27,166
I swear I didn't
mean to hit you.

123
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:29,625
And anyway, I missed, didn't I?

124
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:32,958
That's the truth.
Tell her Sakura...

125
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:35,041
Whatever! Look!
You're an idiot.

126
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:36,541
How are we supposed
to trust you anyway?

127
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:37,791
You're such a bad shot.

128
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:39,166
Ha!
I knew she'd say that!

129
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:42,500
Please!
You have to believe me...!

130
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:48,000
Don't worry.
I believe you.

131
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:52,166
We'll make sure he's
completely immobilized

132
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:54,375
before the festival begins.

133
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:57,291
I want to believe that
we can still save him.

134
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,958
But he himself wants
to return to the Festum...

135
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:02,958
That's why the Coagula
type attacked, to retrieve him.

136
00:07:03,041 --> 00:07:05,333
That's our proof.

137
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:07,708
Thebon dance?

138
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:09,833
Tsubaki, this is your
first bon dance, isn't it.

139
00:07:09,916 --> 00:07:11,208
All right!

140
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:13,208
Don't worry I'll teach you
all the different moves.

141
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:15,916
Yeah, but you don't even
know how to do a bon dance.

142
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,833
You are looking at the guy
in charge of the songs.

143
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:20,000
I'm on the Alvis public
entertainment team.

144
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:21,500
Wow, that's awesome.
Great!

145
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:23,333
Okay, let's not
get too carried away.

146
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:24,541
Oh boy!

147
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:26,041
I'm really hoping that
I get the chance to

148
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:27,375
dance with Maya
while we are there.

149
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:29,458
What are you talking about?
That makes no sense.

150
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:31,583
It's not like it's square
dancing or anything.

151
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:33,791
It's totally different.

152
00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:46,333
I'm sorry for having
to make you suffer.

153
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:48,750
But I have to do this.

154
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:02,875
It's weird. I hardly remembered

155
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:05,708
any of them when
I was at the Neo U.N.

156
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:08,708
But now I can see everyone's
face so clearly in my mind.

157
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:11,625
Promise me
you won't die, Michio.

158
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:12,708
You never know.

159
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:14,333
If you were planning
to die anyway,

160
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:15,750
why'd you bother
coming back here?

161
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:17,000
Huh?

162
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:20,833
When I found out that
you had left the island...

163
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:25,291
I was so sad.
I couldn't stop crying.

164
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:27,916
Well...
I just won't die then.

165
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,416
I promise you, Yumiko.

166
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:38,500
The people of this island
seem to respect the dead.

167
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:41,291
They don't just forget them.

168
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:43,083
And what about you?

169
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:45,791
Do you remember
your old master too?

170
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:48,583
All right, I'm
done with this row.

171
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:51,416
Good.
Turn on the electricity!

172
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:53,583
Tamotsu's done a mighty

173
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:57,333
fine job hanging all those
lanterns, hasn't he?

174
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:01,666
Will you be having
your own stand too?

175
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,125
Yes, I will.

176
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:05,666
Those are your very own hand
made ceramics aren't they?

177
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,041
Yeah.

178
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:10,833
Although I'm not as skilled
at it as Akane of course.

179
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:18,708
Are you in pain?

180
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:22,000
Do you want to
give up your life?

181
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:24,916
Is that it?

182
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:29,583
I had to think about
that for a long time too.

183
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:32,000
Choose carefully.

184
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:40,541
Finally!
There they are!

185
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:44,708
So, how do I look?

186
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:47,208
--You look great Maya!
--You look great Maya!

187
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:48,208
Is something wrong?

188
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:49,958
Huh?
What did you say Soshi?

189
00:09:50,041 --> 00:09:52,166
I didn't know you
had Yukata, Canon.

190
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:54,666
Ms. Hazama was the
one who insisted I wear it.

191
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,375
Does it look weird?

192
00:09:57,416 --> 00:09:59,083
No way!
You don't look weird at all!

193
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:00,583
Don't worry,
You look really good.

194
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:02,500
Oh that sure is good to know.

195
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:05,916
Tsubaki didn't come with you?

196
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,333
She had to do something,
so she'll be here later.

197
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:10,583
Are you going
to be selling those?

198
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:13,208
Probably not.

199
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:16,208
Excuse me.

200
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:22,125
If it's okay.
I would like to buy one.

201
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:24,958
Gobain!

202
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,708
Uh...
So then I say "Gobain?"

203
00:10:26,791 --> 00:10:28,708
Right.
Just like that.

204
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:30,333
Is this one of the
Bon festival dances?

205
00:10:30,416 --> 00:10:31,583
That's his own dumb thing.

206
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:33,958
Stop teaching her your
stupid games, Mamoru!

207
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:35,541
Aw man.

208
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:38,541
I was just about to teach her
the ultimate fighting move too.

209
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:40,125
That one's a seret.

210
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:42,125
Wait a minute if there's some
kind of ultimate fighting move,

211
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:43,291
then I want to learn it too.

212
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:45,083
Forget about it.
You don't need to.

213
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:46,791
Mamoru and I will
handle the fighting.

214
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:48,500
You should just go ahead and
take it easy, try and relax.

215
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:49,041
--Gobain!
--Gobain!

216
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:50,375
And why's that?

217
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:51,791
Are you implying that I'm
useless or something?

218
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:53,875
No. I didn't mean
it that way.

219
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:54,541
I just wanted to--

220
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:55,833
What is your point?

221
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:57,416
I'm going to become
even stronger than Kazuki,

222
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,083
and then I'll always
be able to protect you!

223
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:01,375
You're such an idiot!

224
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:04,250
What are you trying to say?
You make no sense.

225
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:07,208
It's not necessary, okay.

226
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:12,583
Here's a candied apple.
It's the consolation prize.

227
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:14,583
I think it's rigged.
No one can make that shot.

228
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:17,125
My turn!
I wanna chance at it.

229
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,291
--Woah, she got it.
--Woah, she got it.

230
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:26,166
What do you want
to do now, little lady?

231
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,583
Do you want to take
it home as your prize?

232
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:29,000
No.

233
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:31,625
Can I just have a candied
apple like everyone else?

234
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:55,083
Sometimes when
I think about Dad...

235
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:57,708
I think he's laughing
at his coward daughter.

236
00:11:57,791 --> 00:11:59,125
I doubt it.

237
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:02,458
I'm sure he's smiling,
relieved at what you've become.

238
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:07,875
I want to thank all of you
for making these lanterns.

239
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:11,375
I'm sure that Shoko's
feeling very happy right now.

240
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:14,125
And I wanted to thank
you especially, Canon.

241
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:16,541
It really means a lot.

242
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:23,416
Do you think all of our thoughts
and prayers will reach Shoko?

243
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,125
Yeah.

244
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:39,750
That's right.
If you would please follow me.

245
00:12:53,916 --> 00:12:55,708
Welcome, I'll be right th--

246
00:12:57,416 --> 00:13:01,875
Hello. I'm... back.

247
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:07,083
Hello.
I've come back.

248
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:10,083
Hello.
I've come...

249
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:15,000
This is certainly a surprise.

250
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:18,833
Be quiet!

251
00:13:18,916 --> 00:13:21,458
It's too early for
your walk, Chocolat.

252
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:24,208
Guess I have no choice.

253
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,000
Alright, I'm coming.

254
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:38,416
That's weird.

255
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,375
I wonder where Kazuki
and Canon could be.

256
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:43,041
It's not like either one of
them to be late to anything.

257
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:45,958
Maybe they're like Soshi,
and got here really early.

258
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:48,458
So there wasn't any problems
with the security system?

259
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:50,041
No, there wasn't.

260
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:52,291
And I'd only just finished the
freezing procedure last night.

261
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:53,125
Koyo!

262
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:54,625
Where is he?

263
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:57,875
They were planning on
freezing all of Koyo's cells

264
00:13:57,958 --> 00:13:59,333
so that they could
seal him inside of there.

265
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:00,416
Don't tell them that.

266
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,291
What?
Seal him?

267
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:05,791
But somehow he got out and
now he's walking around.

268
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:07,166
So we'll have
to take care of him

269
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:09,666
just like we would
any other Festum.

270
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:10,416
Yes?
What is it?

271
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,833
It's an emergency.

272
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:14,500
Koyo has just been spotted
in the number seven bloc.

273
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:16,208
Wait!
Come back!

274
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:17,250
I think we all have a pretty

275
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:18,958
good idea about
where Koyo's headed!

276
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:20,791
Come on! Let's go!

277
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:27,541
Kazuki.

278
00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:31,041
Koyo...

279
00:14:31,791 --> 00:14:34,125
I have Solomon's response.
It's ambivalent.

280
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:36,166
But it can't seem
to determine the type.

281
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,166
It doesn't recognize
it as the enemy.

282
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,541
It could be treating
it like a Coagula type.

283
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:43,791
It's because this Festum was
at one time a human being.

284
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:46,083
Incoming transmission
from Mr. Mizoguchi.

285
00:14:46,166 --> 00:14:47,791
I'm in the number seven bloc.

286
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:50,958
I've got a clear view
of Kaname's house.

287
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:54,541
It looks like
they're trying to negotiate.

288
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:56,250
Stop acting like such an idiot!

289
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:58,416
Hurry up and
come out of there now!

290
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,416
Come on out Mamoru!
It isn't safe to be in there.

291
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,791
I know he looks like Koyo,

292
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:04,541
but he is not the
same person anymore.

293
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:05,916
Stop saying that!

294
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,500
I don't care if Festum is
Koyo or Koyo is Festum.

295
00:15:08,583 --> 00:15:09,958
Koyo is still Koyo!

296
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:11,291
Oh crap!

297
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:12,833
I don't even know what
I'm talking about anymore!

298
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:15,083
Anyway, the point is,
we're not handing him over!

299
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:16,125
Come here Soshi!

300
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:17,583
You should be in
here with all of us.

301
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:18,958
Oh Sakura...

302
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:20,625
She's always hated the Festum.

303
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:21,708
Why is she doing this...

304
00:15:21,791 --> 00:15:23,208
If it's all right with you,

305
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:26,500
I'd like to borrow something
of yours Mrs. Kaname.

306
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:30,083
What is it, Chocolat?

307
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:33,000
Are you trying to
lead me to something?

308
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:36,125
The assimilation center is
located right at the brain stem.

309
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:38,125
So you should be able
to destroy it with one shot.

310
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:39,750
You heard that,
didn't you, Kyosuke?

311
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:41,625
Yeah, I sure did.

312
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:44,166
I got a problem though.
If I shoot that kid,

313
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:46,375
Maya probably won't
ever talk to me again.

314
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:49,000
We'll never hand
him over to you!

315
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:51,541
Thank you...

316
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:55,708
For...
saving me...

317
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:58,041
I appreciate...
it a lot.

318
00:15:58,125 --> 00:15:59,875
Don't worry about it Koyo.
No big deal.

319
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:03,875
It's the Ocean...
the Ocean...

320
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:06,000
The girl Maya...

321
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:10,458
I saved her.
I saved her, didn't I?

322
00:16:10,541 --> 00:16:13,250
Kazu... ki...

323
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:17,083
Oh Koyo.

324
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:19,541
It's...
It's all my fault.

325
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:21,708
Because I couldn't
save you in time Koyo.

326
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:24,041
No.
That's okay.

327
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:25,916
Thank you.

328
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:29,916
Sakura.
Thanks.

329
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:32,458
I feel so...

330
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:42,750
It was you, Koyo. You were the
one responsible for saving Maya.

331
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:44,916
Thank you so much.

332
00:16:47,041 --> 00:16:48,625
At this rate, it looks
like we may have

333
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:50,208
to force our way in there.

334
00:16:50,291 --> 00:16:52,583
No one is to open fire on
the children, understand?

335
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:53,416
Yes Ma'am.

336
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,125
No.
Wait a minute.

337
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:57,208
Please let me handle it.

338
00:16:57,291 --> 00:16:59,083
Using those wooden swords?

339
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:00,708
What are you planning on doing?

340
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:01,916
Fine.
Go ahead.

341
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,291
I'll let you try your way.

342
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:04,750
Thank you.

343
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:07,958
Kazuki!
Come out here.

344
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:09,708
Michio.
Stick to the plan.

345
00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:11,750
Move to the southeast
side of Kaname house.

346
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:13,333
Roger that.

347
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:16,875
I want you to fight
against me. Kazuki.

348
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:18,500
Right.

349
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:24,750
Are you idiots!

350
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:26,958
You guys are gonna
get yourselves killed!

351
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:28,125
Yeah? So?

352
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:29,958
I guess we are
a bunch of idiots!

353
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:31,625
And we're not going to
change the way we are

354
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:34,166
no matter how many
damn times you beat us up!

355
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:36,750
And if you got assimilated,
we'd do the same thing!

356
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:38,833
We'd still be protecting you!

357
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:41,916
Unbelievable.
They really are idiots.

358
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:44,291
All right.

359
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:46,791
I'm locked in and
ready to shoot at anytime.

360
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:48,625
You just need to decide
whether or not you want me to

361
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:51,666
blow off his head in
front of all those children.

362
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:54,541
Why would they
send the Megaselion

363
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:56,833
to fight against Koyo?

364
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:02,625
Mr. Mizoguchi...

365
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,083
Aw man, that's great.

366
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:09,333
Just what do you think you're
trying to do there, Missy?

367
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:11,291
Hey Chocolat!

368
00:18:15,416 --> 00:18:17,208
Hazama...

369
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:25,500
I appreciate you
protecting Koyo...

370
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:26,750
Kazuki.

371
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:28,875
But that isn't him!
Koyo's already gone!

372
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:30,750
That thing over there
doesn't have any feelings.

373
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:33,541
If he doesn't feel,
how could he thank us?

374
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:35,250
So what you're trying to tell me

375
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:38,083
is that Koyo is still
living inside of that thing?

376
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,791
You're not listening.
Koyo said "thank you" to Sakura.

377
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:42,875
But he's already
been assimilated.

378
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:44,291
How could he say "thank you"?

379
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:45,541
This is impossible!

380
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,333
They even have
the Megaselion out.

381
00:18:47,416 --> 00:18:48,708
It must be a big deal.

382
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:50,708
I wonder what's going on inside?

383
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:52,125
Aren't you guys curious too?

384
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:53,916
There's a Festum inside there.

385
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,500
--Huh?
--Huh?

386
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:57,708
Well, he was being locked up, so
I decided to help him get free.

387
00:18:57,791 --> 00:18:59,541
But, why would you do that?

388
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:02,208
I was the same way.
So I knew how he was feeling.

389
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:03,291
Huh?

390
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:04,625
What do you mean
you were the same way?

391
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:06,916
I am what's called a Core type.
And so you see...

392
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,125
Us Core Types are branched
off from the Coagula types.

393
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:13,541
There are only a few
of us in the whole world.

394
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:17,541
A blended independent body
of a human and Festum.

395
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:22,125
Are you there?

396
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:24,125
Koyo you...

397
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,250
I've got a clear shot!
Should I take it?

398
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:27,958
No, wait!

399
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:31,458
It's Chocolat.

400
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:39,958
Chocolat!

401
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:47,208
Are you there?
Tell me, are you there?

402
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:51,916
I left it at home!

403
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,625
Kyosuke do it!

404
00:19:53,708 --> 00:19:55,208
There's no shot!

405
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:56,750
You'll never hit him.
You're too far.

406
00:19:56,833 --> 00:20:01,000
Tell me, are you there?
Are you, are you there?

407
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:04,250
I was here before,
but I am not any longer.

408
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:05,125
No Canon!

409
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:06,666
What is she trying to do?

410
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:07,833
No Kazuki!

411
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:11,333
Just trust her...
Can you do that?

412
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:18,000
Sho... ko...

413
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:29,666
Shoko...
She's not here...

414
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:32,458
...anymore...

415
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:35,958
Shoko...

416
00:20:56,291 --> 00:20:57,750
Koyo.

417
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:03,708
I feel so sad.

418
00:21:05,916 --> 00:21:08,708
Shoko is really gone...

419
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:19,041
Shoko is...

420
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:22,583
I know.

421
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:25,500
Shoko's...
She's really...

422
00:21:26,375 --> 00:21:28,416
Shoko is...

423
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,166
Now is my chance...

424
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:36,875
I've got a good clear
shot of the target again.

425
00:21:36,958 --> 00:21:38,541
There's no need, Kyosuke...

426
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:39,833
Why not?

427
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:42,500
We no longer need to worry.

428
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:46,083
Because Festum don't cry.

429
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:48,750
You have a point...

430
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:51,375
Solomon has responded.

431
00:21:51,458 --> 00:21:53,375
It's determined
that it's a slave type.

432
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:55,541
It's just so hard to believe.

433
00:21:55,625 --> 00:21:59,958
That a Festum would destroy...
its own assimilation abilities.

434
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:03,333
That means our
ideas are not wrong.

435
00:22:03,416 --> 00:22:06,333
We were on the
right path after all...

436
00:22:06,416 --> 00:22:08,416
...and that path
which leads to the

437
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,916
coexistence of
Festums and humans...

438
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,625
Is just the first step.

439
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:20,958
But now is not the time.
It is still too early.

440
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:24,541
And until that day comes...

441
00:22:24,958 --> 00:22:29,041
Good night...
Koyo.

442
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,958
♪ closing song ♪

443
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:41,166
The present becomes a memory.

444
00:23:41,583 --> 00:23:44,833
We rush to see
our lives blossom.

445
00:23:47,958 --> 00:23:50,041
It's beautiful.

446
00:23:50,958 --> 00:23:54,916
Next on "Fafner"
episode twenty-one.

447
00:23:56,875 --> 00:23:58,541
"Future."

448
00:23:59,541 --> 00:24:01,375
Are you there?
