00:01:51,291 --> 00:01:53,166
Come to think of it,
you used to wet your bed

3
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:55,833
when you were little,
didn't you Michio?

4
00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:58,083
Shut up!
What are you talking about?

5
00:01:58,791 --> 00:02:00,875
I never did anything like that!

6
00:02:09,125 --> 00:02:10,416
Sakura!

7
00:02:17,125 --> 00:02:19,041
Prepare for a brain scan
and radiation treatment.

8
00:02:19,125 --> 00:02:20,708
Hurry!

00:02:22,625 --> 00:02:24,041
Solomon has responded.

00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:25,916
Three new enemies have
appeared eighty kilometers

11
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,416
off the southeast bank.

12
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,958
Deploying the number one and
number two Welle Shields.

13
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:31,375
They haven't
changed their patterns,

14
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:33,958
but they're attacking
more frequently.

15
00:02:36,583 --> 00:02:39,458
Commander Makabe, I have news.

16
00:02:40,958 --> 00:02:42,541
Attention all Fafner pilots.

17
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:44,291
We are changing part
of the formation.

18
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:46,541
So be sure to remember
your recent training.

19
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:48,000
Changing?
What does he mean?

20
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:49,875
What part?

21
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:52,125
Canon is taking
Sakura's position?

22
00:02:52,208 --> 00:02:53,333
But why?

23
00:02:53,416 --> 00:02:55,583
Where's Sakura?
Did something happen to her?

24
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:57,833
Sakura is...

25
00:02:57,916 --> 00:03:00,750
She's fighting at
a different location.

26
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:08,000
Tsubaki!

27
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:10,958
It's too dangerous
for you out here.

28
00:03:13,958 --> 00:03:15,541
What...?

29
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:19,833
All of these things are dead.

30
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:21,375
How come?

31
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:29,958
There are no more Festum left.

32
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:31,833
All the pilots are
in good condition.

33
00:03:31,916 --> 00:03:33,791
The Fafners are
on their way back.

34
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:35,416
Commander Makabe.

35
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,916
Yes, what is it?

36
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,375
The pilots have all
been instructed to

37
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:40,416
head to the medical room.

38
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:43,000
I understand.

39
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:45,833
I'll leave you to
take care of them.

40
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:49,750
Where is Tsubaki
Minashiro right now?

41
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:52,250
It's strange.

42
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:54,375
I wonder why they want us all
to meet in the medical room.

43
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:57,833
Kazuki, do you have any
idea what's going on?

44
00:03:57,916 --> 00:03:59,916
No.
Not a clue.

45
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,250
Soshi...

46
00:04:06,416 --> 00:04:09,208
What happened, Soshi?
Do you know?

47
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:11,666
Please listen.

48
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:14,958
Try not to get too upset
when you go inside, Kenji.

49
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,833
Kenji, wait!

50
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:31,875
No. What happened...
to her?

51
00:04:31,958 --> 00:04:34,666
Why the hell did this happen?

52
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,333
Even the tree is almost dead.

53
00:04:39,416 --> 00:04:40,958
Why's that?

54
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:42,958
I would like to
know that myself.

55
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:44,916
Commander Makabe?

56
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:47,250
Commander Makabe.

57
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:50,250
This is the first time
that you've come see me.

58
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:52,083
Tell me something...

59
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:54,500
Mark Sein's existence,
the abnormalities we're

60
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:57,541
witnessing in nature, the
enemy's attack patterns...

61
00:04:57,625 --> 00:05:00,541
...and the recent assimilation
of one of our pilots...

62
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:03,541
All of these things
are related, aren't they?

63
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:07,458
As well as...
the fact that I awakened.

64
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:10,708
And let's not forget how
you let Koyo Kasugai out.

65
00:05:10,791 --> 00:05:12,000
That's right.

66
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:15,041
I did it so that the North
Pole MIR and our MIR

67
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:16,916
could understand life better...

68
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,625
Life?

69
00:05:18,708 --> 00:05:21,250
In Japan...
a long time ago...

70
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:22,666
The MIR took the "power" of

71
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,250
becoming parents
away from you,

72
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:27,541
because it couldn't understand
what it's like to be born.

73
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:29,833
And so it tried
to protect humans

74
00:05:29,916 --> 00:05:31,791
from death by taking life.

75
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:35,500
However now... The
MIR is relearning about life.

76
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:39,250
You mean it's learning about the
concept of life and death?

77
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:41,083
Is that why it made
all these flowers

78
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:42,916
on the island blossom suddenly?

79
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,916
Yes.

80
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,416
But there's still
a whole lot more

81
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,583
that it would like
to learn about.

82
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:49,125
Is that why you've
been coming out here?

83
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:51,958
So that you can teach
them that during battles?

84
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:53,750
Have you been
leaking information

85
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:55,000
about us to the enemy?

86
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:57,083
When you do that
the island is at risk.

87
00:05:57,166 --> 00:05:59,375
After everything
we've sacrificed...

88
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:00,708
You're heartless.

89
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:03,125
Don't you feel
any sorrow at all?

90
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:06,958
How can you even say that?
Of course she feels sorrow!

91
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:09,625
Tsubaki wished that she
could've known her father

92
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:11,583
and mother like a normal child.

93
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:14,208
So why wouldn't she feel
sad about people dying?

94
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:17,291
How could you even
say such a thing to her?

95
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:23,250
A lot of insects died today.
And a lot flowers died too.

96
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:26,458
Commander are
you sad about that?

97
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:28,000
What is it that you're implying?

98
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:30,458
That we're like insects
and flowers to you?

99
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:32,000
Not at all.

100
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:35,208
You see insects and flowers
don't feel sad about themselves.

101
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:37,375
Animals don't really
know what sorrow is,

102
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:39,708
so then how can they feel sad?

103
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:44,458
How come... humans are the
only ones to feel sadness?

104
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:48,458
Yet they alone have the
potential to truly answer that.

105
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:51,875
The answer to that.
What is it?

106
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:55,041
So then the more
we pilot Fafner,

107
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:57,125
the closer we come to dying?

108
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:58,125
It's not death.

109
00:06:58,208 --> 00:06:59,791
Your body crystallizes
due to the

110
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:01,500
chromosomal changes
it goes through.

111
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:03,791
And how can you
call that being alive?

112
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:06,333
You know what?
Maya's father was right!

113
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:09,500
We're nothing but batteries
to mobilize the Fafners.

114
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:13,541
And Sakura...
finally ran out of power...

115
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:15,958
If Dr. Tohmi research
succeeds, we can prevent

116
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:17,666
the assimilation from occurring.

117
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:20,291
Too late...
Sakura's already...

118
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:26,333
What are you doing?!

119
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:29,000
I'm taking her home with me...

120
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:30,250
Come on.

121
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:31,791
Mother's going to take
you home now, Sakura.

122
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:34,041
You can't!
She's not stable. If you--

123
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:37,416
Don't you think Sakura's
fought enough already!

124
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:38,958
Let her rest in peace.

125
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:40,625
You're not helping her.

126
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:41,666
Kiyomi!

127
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:42,916
Kiyomi! Please!
Listen to me!

128
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,541
Let go!

129
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:47,291
Kiyomi.
Kiyomi!

130
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:48,625
Sakura...

131
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,250
Kenji.

132
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:11,916
Sakura...

133
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,583
Kenji...

134
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:26,083
You and I still have
a fight to settle, right?

135
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,083
If a world where
there's constant

136
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:33,666
fighting fills you
with sorrow then...

137
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,250
What do you think
is the best way

138
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:37,416
for you to erase this sorrow?

139
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,833
To teach them.

140
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:41,666
So that the Festum can
better understand our sorrow.

141
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,083
Yes.

142
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:45,541
Akane Makabe was the first
to come up with the idea.

143
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:49,708
It's so simple a solution yet
very difficult at the same time.

144
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:50,958
I don't believe it!

145
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:52,708
Are you telling me that
that's what you've been

146
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:54,791
trying to accomplish
during the battles?

147
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:56,375
I'm afraid that,

148
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:59,458
if I don't do this they'll end
up choosing the wrong feeling.

149
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:01,375
A destructive emotion
that you can only

150
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03,583
feel if you are alive...

151
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:05,666
That's hatred...

152
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,250
If that's true,
the enemy already

153
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:08,708
understands us fairly well?

154
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:10,416
How am I supposed
to believe that?

155
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,916
Because...

156
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
...I am the proof.

157
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:17,375
Akane Makabe
showed the enemy life

158
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:19,291
by treating them
like living things...

159
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:21,083
It was the same thing with me.

160
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:24,416
And that's how my mother
gave this island's MIR a life.

161
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,541
I know you have your doubts.
But it's true.

162
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:29,041
Because if this island's MIR

163
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:31,291
wasn't able to
understand life...

164
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:34,250
...there would've been no way
for me to have been born.

165
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:35,541
Makes me wonder...

166
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:38,000
Are we advancing
in the right direction.

167
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:40,125
We made the island
for our posterity.

168
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:41,791
And we used the enemy's power,

169
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:43,416
and to ensure our
survival, we've been

170
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,833
sacrificing our own children.

171
00:09:45,916 --> 00:09:48,500
We should be ashamed.

172
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:50,166
The right power and path.

173
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,750
You shall find it if
you search for it.

174
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:55,250
And you're the kind of
person who can do that.

175
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:58,708
The fact that you came here
to see me is proof of this.

176
00:09:58,791 --> 00:10:01,041
The path you
seek lies within you.

177
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:04,458
Now you must find it.

178
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:09,625
I see...
Poor Sakura...

179
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:13,458
Um...
May I ask you something?

180
00:10:13,541 --> 00:10:15,333
Sure.
What is it?

181
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:16,666
About Shoko...

182
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:20,250
She wasn't your biological
daughter, am I right?

183
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:22,708
No.

184
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:24,875
They thought I had the
characteristics of someone

185
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,333
who'd be good at
raising children.

186
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:28,708
So the Albericht
Organization gave Shoko

187
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:30,208
to me to raise as my own.

188
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:32,541
And what about Kazuki and Maya?

189
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:33,833
They're different.

190
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:35,916
Shoko and Koyo
were the exceptions.

191
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,750
They were the only
children who weren't actually

192
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:39,958
genetically related
to their parents.

193
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:41,833
But they all have a
genetic component of the

194
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:43,833
Festum in them, don't they?

195
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:46,208
It was originally intended
to protect the genes

196
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:47,958
from being polluted by MIR.

197
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:49,458
If you don't
pilot a Fafner,

198
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:52,083
then the MIR
factor isn't dangerous.

199
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:56,958
I don't have it.
I'm missing the factor.

200
00:10:57,541 --> 00:10:59,958
That's why my integration
with the Siegfried System

201
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:01,625
hasn't been completed yet...

202
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:04,958
And why I still can't
pilot the Nothung Model.

203
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:07,250
Canon.

204
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:11,791
I just want to...
be like everyone else...

205
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:15,625
There...

206
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,416
That's all of it.

207
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:25,125
I wonder what happens
at the end of this story.

208
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:29,750
You know what?

209
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:32,375
I'm positive it'll
have a happy ending.

210
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,375
After all, that's
what I'm fighting for.

211
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:50,791
The Mark Sein is able to
connect the best with the core.

212
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:52,458
But it's not because
it's more like the

213
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:54,875
Festums than other Fafners.

214
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:57,083
Then is it possible to
apply the power-gain

215
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:59,375
release
to other machines?

216
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:00,708
No.

217
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:02,250
In the simulation, the
pilot's senses overloaded

218
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:04,375
and weren't able
to keep up with it.

219
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:07,333
The sensory elements which
are buried like filament in the

220
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:10,875
Silicon Nanofilms body
become extremely unstable.

221
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:13,166
During assimilation
their numbers...

222
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:15,000
...shape and locale change.

223
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:16,583
So you see...

224
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:19,875
That's the reason why the whole
body feels like melted rubber.

225
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:22,916
Why didn't it happen to Kazuki?
Why's he all right?

226
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,666
I can only speculate that
his mind adapted itself...

227
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:29,458
There's clearly a higher sense
of self-consciousness from the

228
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:31,208
bond between Kazuki and Soshi.

229
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:32,791
Each one wishes
to better themselves

230
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:34,500
for the sake of the other.

231
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:38,166
And so perhaps, that is the
biggest factor influencing it.

232
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:40,166
It's impressive,
but Kazuki couldn't have

233
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:41,833
progressed to that
level on his own...

234
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:43,416
Right?

235
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,000
Which means we have no idea how
well the Mark Sein will do in

236
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:48,250
remote operations when
it no longer has direct

237
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:51,166
communication with the
Siegfried System.

238
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:52,375
Commander!

239
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:54,000
Does that mean we're
actually going to join

240
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:56,166
forces with the Neo U.N.?

241
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,833
At this rate, if the enemy
continues it's all out war of

242
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:03,000
attrition this may be a possible
solution we want to consider.

243
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:05,791
If we were to join them, it
would cause too many problems

244
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:07,708
such as the island's
defense during battle or

245
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:09,916
the chain of command between us.

246
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,041
Soshi Minashiro is
planning to do just that.

247
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,333
Huh?

248
00:13:13,416 --> 00:13:15,250
In the event we were
to join the general attack

249
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:16,541
on the North Pole MIR...

250
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:18,416
...he asked whether
or not it'd be possible

251
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,708
to build the Siegfried
System inside a Fafner.

252
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:23,208
Build a Siegfried System
inside a Fafner?

253
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:24,791
That's absurd!

254
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:26,958
Why does he think we made the
two separate in the first place!

255
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:28,625
If he pilots a Fafner like that

256
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:30,833
he'll definitely wind
up assimilated!

257
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:33,583
That's pretty much
what I told him too.

258
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:36,708
So he asked for your
advice as well Dr. Tohmi?

259
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:38,125
Yes.

260
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:40,416
He wanted to know
approximately how much time

261
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,750
he would have before he would
completely lose consciousness.

262
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:46,791
It seems...

263
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:49,250
...that I don't have
much time left.

264
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:51,916
What are you
going to do, Soshi?

265
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,583
I have prepared myself for
the worst possible outcome.

266
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:57,333
I see...

267
00:13:57,416 --> 00:13:58,625
We weren't able to
become actual

268
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:01,916
brother and sister
until the end, huh?

269
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,250
I saw you for the
first time ten years ago.

270
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:06,916
My father took me to see you.

271
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,291
I remember.

272
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:11,416
Ever since then, I have
visited you many times.

273
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,000
I know.

274
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:16,333
I lived to protect
you and the island.

275
00:14:16,416 --> 00:14:17,791
At least...

276
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:19,250
...that's what I thought.

277
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:23,166
You thought that until you
were hurt by Kazuki, right?

278
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:26,375
Tell me what you
want to do Soshi.

279
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:27,791
If in the end, we join the

280
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:30,416
Neo U.N.'s
final battle operations...

281
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,291
...I want to fight
alongside all of my friends.

282
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:35,166
Therefore I'd like
to leave this island.

283
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,416
And so I need the
core's permission.

284
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:41,041
Don't you realize that you
already left me long time ago.

285
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:42,625
However...

286
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:46,458
...you won't be able to be with
them for a long period of time.

287
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:49,000
Even with the extra stress of
the Siegfried System

288
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:50,291
and Fafner placed on me,

289
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:52,875
I can still operate
for about eighteen hours.

290
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:56,083
And in that time, if you
are with the most important

291
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:58,625
people to you, you are
the happiest, correct?

292
00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:00,125
That's right.

293
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:02,041
In that case,
don't worry about me.

294
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:03,416
Go right ahead.

295
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,875
I hope I'll still be able
come outside and watch,

296
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:08,166
so I can see you off.

297
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:10,833
I'm so sorry...

298
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:14,666
I appreciate this.
Thank you.

299
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:17,458
Now you have
no choice but to fight.

300
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:18,833
I hope someday you'll remember

301
00:15:18,916 --> 00:15:21,000
that there's also
a different way.

302
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:22,333
I will.

303
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:25,750
Oh! And another thing,
don't forget me okay?

304
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:29,083
I won't.

305
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:31,958
I promise.

306
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:37,583
Canon Memphis?

307
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:38,916
Yes.

308
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,083
She demands to be injected
with alien biomaterial.

309
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:43,000
She's locked herself
in the medical room.

310
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:46,083
And she refuses to battle
if her demands are met.

311
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:47,375
She probably thought someone

312
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:49,458
was giving an order
when they weren't...

313
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:50,750
Then again...

314
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:54,750
Without knowing
your reasons for it...

315
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:56,833
...I cannot give
you this injection!

316
00:15:56,916 --> 00:15:58,708
Please. Canon.

317
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,916
Just tell us who
told you to do this?

318
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:01,916
Uh...

319
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,375
Look.

320
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:06,041
Once you tell us the truth,
We'll inject this in you.

321
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:07,666
So just tell us.

322
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:10,166
No, stop it!
You can't!

323
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:11,708
Kazuki was the one.

324
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:12,458
What?

325
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:14,208
He did?
When was this?

326
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:17,500
It was back when I tried to
disappear along with the island.

327
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:20,208
Kazuki told me I had
to make my own choice.

328
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:21,583
But this is?

329
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:22,708
Not just him...

330
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:24,208
Mrs. Hazama said it too...

331
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:26,000
She said that I
had to live without orders.

332
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:27,166
Wait just a minute.

333
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,750
That isn't what
I was getting at, at all!

334
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:32,541
I've had hard times.

335
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:34,750
And I've thought...
quite a lot.

336
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:38,541
In the end...
there's only one solution.

337
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,083
I'm making a
choice once and for all.

338
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:47,791
And this here is my choice.
To be on this island.

339
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:53,458
I'm going now.

340
00:16:58,166 --> 00:17:00,250
I'm going too...

341
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:02,625
...Sakura.

342
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,416
Enemy sighted
120 kilometers away.

343
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,541
It's on approach.
There appears to only be one.

344
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:10,791
We've identified it
as a Scarabee-type.

345
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:12,375
However it could be
a new mutation.

346
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:13,625
There's only one of them?

347
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:15,458
I guess as soon
as Sakura collapsed,

348
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:17,333
they changed their patterns.

349
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:19,541
I have no doubt that the
previous two hundred enemies

350
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:22,458
deployed were sacrificed in
order to exhaust our pilots and

351
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,750
increase their
odds of assimilation.

352
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:26,375
Attack the enemy
with full force!

353
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:27,875
Let's show them
just how ineffective

354
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:29,250
their war of attrition is.

355
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:30,375
Sorry I'm late.

356
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:31,458
You okay?

357
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:32,541
I'm all right now.

358
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:34,500
Ok, number one
and two Welle Shields

359
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:36,750
are ready to be deployed.

360
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:38,875
I've never fought
in a Fafner for real.

361
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:41,041
I've only done
it in the simulators.

362
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:42,916
Yeah. I've
never done it either.

363
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,291
There's no need to worry.

364
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:46,791
What are you doing here?

365
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:49,041
I'm gonna defeat
all the enemies.

366
00:17:50,541 --> 00:17:51,500
That's right.

367
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:54,291
Here.
It's for you.

368
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:55,791
It's for luck.

369
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:58,375
Wear it and it
will keep you safe.

370
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:09,666
Mark Sieben, check out the
enemy's defensive capabilities

371
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:11,791
and determine if
this is a new type.

372
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:13,791
Mark Acht, Funf, and Babalon,

373
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:17,083
you three will come in direct
contact with the enemy.

374
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:21,166
Megaselion and Mark Sein
will analyze the enemy's

375
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:24,083
method of attack and try to
capture it from behind.

376
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:27,041
Whatever happens,
don't break this formation.

377
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:29,458
The Denial Defense Line
is about to be crossed.

378
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:31,750
All right Mark Sieben,
begin your attack!

379
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:33,166
Roger.

380
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:43,250
Huh?

381
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,916
Eject the cockpit bloc!

382
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:50,500
Did you see that?
What the hell happened?

383
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:52,750
Mark Funf, retreat.

384
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:54,541
Babalon and Mark Acht,
keep your distance

385
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:56,958
and intercept it
from both sides!

386
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:11,750
How did it...?

387
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:15,541
Why isn't the pain
inhibitor working?

388
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:17,041
This makes no
sense the data isn't

389
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:18,875
showing any damage anywhere...

390
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:19,750
Canon!

391
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:20,958
Got it!

392
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,958
There.
We're back online.

393
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:32,291
Why...?

394
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:35,291
...why isn't it attacking us?

395
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:39,416
The enemy is merely sending all
of our attacks back towards us.

396
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,666
It isn't attacking
or assimilating us?

397
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,166
That means...!

398
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:44,583
Yes.
That's right.

399
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:47,208
It has understood your pain.

400
00:19:49,916 --> 00:19:51,833
Mark Funf, launch
the Aegis equipment

401
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:53,333
and try to hold off the enemy.

402
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:54,458
Roger!

403
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:59,250
Here I go!

404
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:03,750
Mark Sein, approach
the enemy from behind

405
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:05,041
and try to immobilize it.

406
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:06,208
Understood.

407
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:15,333
Good.
Now keep on crushing it.

408
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:26,416
Kazuki!

409
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:34,833
Assimilation...
Oh no.

410
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:42,541
The enemy is beginning
to spread its roots.

411
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,916
Soshi...

412
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,750
The enemy has now
reached the Keel Block!

413
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:51,166
What?!

414
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:01,833
Was it trying to take over
the system from the start?

415
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:05,041
Assimilation with the
Siegfried System has started.

416
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:07,333
Separate the enemy's
main body from its roots!

417
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:09,208
You bastard!

418
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:27,208
Soshi...

419
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:30,291
Ask Kazuki...
if he can lend me a hand...

420
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:31,750
Kazuki!

421
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:34,333
I need you to try
and move your hand?

422
00:21:38,916 --> 00:21:40,000
Good enough!

423
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:42,833
I won't let them feel
sad any longer...

424
00:21:42,916 --> 00:21:46,125
I'll protect you!

425
00:21:53,958 --> 00:21:55,500
Eject now!

426
00:22:33,833 --> 00:22:38,791
♪ closing song ♪

427
00:23:38,916 --> 00:23:41,500
Power that's been taken.

428
00:23:42,541 --> 00:23:45,000
Hope that's been taken.

429
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:48,875
Yumi... ko...

number twenty-three.

00:23:56,541 --> 00:23:58,333
"Decoy."

432
00:23:59,458 --> 00:24:01,583
Are you there?
