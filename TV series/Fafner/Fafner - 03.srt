1
00:00:14,291 --> 00:00:15,791
It doesn't exist?

2
00:00:15,875 --> 00:00:18,750
It was destroyed 29 years ago.

3
00:00:18,833 --> 00:00:21,458
You mean Tokto and Osaka are...?

4
00:00:21,541 --> 00:00:24,250
...are gone and have
been for a long time.

5
00:00:24,333 --> 00:00:27,541
And in a way, Tatsumiya
Island disappeared to.

6
00:00:27,625 --> 00:00:30,041
You won't find it on any map.

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,666
Akane...

8
00:00:56,083 --> 00:00:58,250
I'm sorry.

9
00:01:06,083 --> 00:01:11,041
♪ opening song ♪

10
00:02:40,833 --> 00:02:42,833
No visible object on the sea.

11
00:02:42,916 --> 00:02:44,416
Reporting to headquarters,

12
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,291
target could not be
located today either.

13
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:54,333
A Neo U.N. recon plane
just passed overhead.]

14
00:02:55,958 --> 00:02:57,416
I'm on pins and needles.

15
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:00,875
I have a constant fear that
they'll discover us someday.

16
00:03:01,666 --> 00:03:02,916
They might have detected

17
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,458
something from the
previous battle.

18
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:09,375
We're hiding from
both man and alien...

19
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:11,125
I understand why...

20
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:13,958
...but it makes me feel uneasy.

21
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,625
I'm outta here.

22
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:31,208
I'll see ya later , Koyo.

23
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:32,375
You are so forgetful.

24
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:33,375
Mamoru!

25
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:34,833
Come with me!

26
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:37,875
Are we picking up
on underclass girls again?

27
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:41,041
Hey, you two...

28
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:43,458
Remember what
we're doing after school?

29
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:45,500
We've been discovered.

30
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:47,291
Today is our lucky day.

31
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:48,958
I'm teaching you something new.

32
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:50,875
It's a special move.

33
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:56,166
Mom?

34
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:05,250
Thank you for coming
on such short notice.

35
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:08,666
By now, I'm sure you have
already heard about the neo U.N.

36
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:12,500
recon planes conducting frequent
searches over the island.

37
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:14,041
And...

38
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:15,875
I'm thinking of
moving the island,

39
00:04:15,958 --> 00:04:18,833
temporarily to an
archipelago in the northwest.

40
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:21,250
Are you really moving
the island this time?

41
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:24,500
Brunhilde System is currently
still on cold stand by.

42
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:26,750
Besides that the system has...

43
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:29,500
I know that Minashiro
had been in charge of it.

44
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:31,166
But we can't let the Neo U.N.

45
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:33,416
know about this
islands whereabouts.

46
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,208
I want you to take over
and move us immediately.

47
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:38,500
I understand.

48
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:41,250
Dr. Tohmi.

49
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:46,083
Wait...
We need to talk.

50
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:47,333
Of course.

51
00:04:47,416 --> 00:04:48,541
But not here.

52
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:50,333
In the Alvis medical room.

53
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,583
Yes, I understand.

54
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:06,000
Even if we could use
Mark Elf in actual combat...

55
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:08,041
...there is no guarantee
it can withstand the

56
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:11,458
upcoming operations
if Kazuki is the only pilot.

57
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:13,208
So then...

58
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:15,375
Dr. Tohmi, I would
like you to find

59
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:17,458
me some more pilot candidates.

60
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:26,958
Some of those children will have
to depart again, won't they?

61
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:45,750
These are some pictures from the

62
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:47,833
class field trip we
had the other day.

63
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:49,250
I'm so envious.

64
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:51,958
All of you got to
be in the picture.

65
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:58,250
I want to hurry up
and get better so

66
00:05:58,333 --> 00:06:01,125
I can be in the
picture with everyone.

67
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:02,458
Yeah!

68
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:03,958
You will!

69
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:05,291
Just do your best!

70
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:08,125
Yeah!
I will!

71
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:10,166
These are the children with

72
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,916
high synergetic code
formation values.

73
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,791
Koyo Kasugai, Sakura Kaname,

74
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:22,166
Mamoru Kodate, Shoko Hazama...

75
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:25,375
Are you sure...

76
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:27,250
...that you want
to include Maya?

77
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:29,666
Shoko Hazahma and
Maya Tohmi It appears

78
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:32,083
the two of them have
a physical handicap.

79
00:06:32,166 --> 00:06:35,375
I will place them under
Yumiko's direction for a while.

80
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:37,791
Good idea.

81
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:40,458
I'm going to begin
orientation with the parents.

82
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:42,041
I'm coming with you.

83
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:02,500
This is...

84
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,250
Seiichiro ...

85
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:23,916
But I just lost Seiichiro...

86
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:38,833
I'm very sorry.

87
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:41,416
That's all the
information we have.

88
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:44,583
Why?

89
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:47,416
Why does it have to be my Kenji?

90
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:51,708
As you well know, these
children were raised for this.

91
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:53,291
I know that!

92
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:55,083
It's true, but...

93
00:07:56,708 --> 00:07:57,916
It's just...

94
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,833
...not him.

95
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:02,791
Kenji.

96
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:06,083
Please wait!

97
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:07,041
Shoko...

98
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:09,083
Shoko's condition is...

99
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:10,875
I'm very sorry.

100
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:12,125
But her physical condition

101
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:14,250
and her synergetic code
formation values...

102
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:16,250
Well, they're not correlated.

103
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:18,416
You know that, don't you?

104
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:27,750
To think that a numerical value
can determine a child's future.

105
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:31,250
This must be really
hard for the parents too.

106
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:33,041
I could have done
this alone you know.

107
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:34,208
It's all right.

108
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:37,000
This is part of my
job as a physician.

109
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:45,708
Are you serious?

110
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:46,375
Yes!

111
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:47,416
He did it dear.

112
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,875
Look!

113
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:50,666
Let me see.

114
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:52,250
Look at that!

115
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:53,875
This thing is for real!

116
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:54,791
Koyo!

117
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:56,333
Come down here honey!

118
00:08:56,416 --> 00:08:57,750
Koyo!

119
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:03,041
Mamoru, what are you doing?

120
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:05,458
I'm studying.

121
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:14,916
Is this comic interesting?

122
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:18,000
Yeah!

123
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:19,916
I see.

124
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:28,708
Dear.

125
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:33,791
The project.

126
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:36,375
Did you mention it
to Mamoru already?

127
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:38,666
You know, about sending him.

128
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:40,875
But honey...!

129
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:42,083
Keep it down!

130
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:44,208
My deadline is tomorrow!]

131
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:51,250
I had no idea that Maya
had a physical handicap.

132
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:52,416
Oh mom.

133
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,500
She is one of the
lucky ones, you know.

134
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:57,458
She won't die as along as
she's under my direction.

135
00:09:57,541 --> 00:09:58,833
Yes, I know.

136
00:09:58,916 --> 00:10:01,541
I was honestly
very happy about that.

137
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:03,541
But...

138
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:05,583
...but still...

139
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:16,625
Hmm... Let's see...

140
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:18,875
I thought it was in here.

141
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:20,375
I'm coming in.

142
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:21,833
Okay.

143
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:26,416
What are you looking for?

144
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:29,041
Oh!
Here it is.

145
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:32,291
Wow. It's Dad's camera!

146
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:34,458
I didn't know it was in there.

147
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:44,250
Can all of us go
in there too now?

148
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:45,750
Yes.

149
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:47,000
And you'll be all right
because you already

150
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:49,791
have an ID chip
implanted in your bodies.

151
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:53,625
How cool!

152
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:55,333
It's like a secret base.

153
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:58,958
It actually is a secret base
cuz it's a secret, right?

154
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:02,333
Why have you guys been hiding
a place like this from us?

155
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:04,083
I mean it's so awesome.

156
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:05,541
Well we...

157
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:08,208
Children need to
concentrate on studying.

158
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:12,250
She seems a bit
different, don't ya think?

159
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:13,958
She does.

160
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,833
This is where he used to work...

161
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:20,500
My dad.

162
00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:29,458
My Mom.

163
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:33,750
Why's she acting that way?

164
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:35,916
It's probably
because she's working.

165
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,375
You know, my mom's been giving

166
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:39,125
me the cold shoulder
too these days.

167
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:40,750
Mine too.

168
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:43,291
That's probably cuz your parents
have already given up on you.

169
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:45,833
Your parents would never
do a thing like that!

170
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,125
Look it's Kazuki.

171
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:53,208
And Soshi too.

172
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:55,791
Hey sis, got a second.

173
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:57,125
Hm?

174
00:12:02,791 --> 00:12:04,625
Okay everyone...
Gather round.

175
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:07,333
They're gonna take a
commemorative photo.

176
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:08,916
A commemorative photo?

177
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,125
Sakura, get over here.

178
00:12:13,041 --> 00:12:14,958
I see how this place is
interesting to them,

179
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:16,291
but still...

180
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:17,708
Your break is now over!

181
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,708
I want you to hurry up!

182
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:31,333
What's 15,436 minus 15,433?

183
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:33,208
Three!

184
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:52,500
All right, we are going to begin
your Fafner training now.

185
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:53,666
Our training?

186
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:54,833
What's a Fafner?

187
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:56,500
It's that big robot.

188
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:59,583
Now, ' which one of
you would like to go first.

189
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:06,458
Give instructions
to each section.

190
00:13:06,541 --> 00:13:08,583
See?
Use this monitor.

191
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:10,875
Take your time but
make sure you're accurate.

192
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:12,041
Understand?

193
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,666
I think so.

194
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:19,083
Well then how are the
new recruits doing?

195
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:20,625
They're doing
pretty well considering

196
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:22,833
that it's their first time.

197
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,625
Well, for their
first time, not bad.

198
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:42,041
What's Mark Elf's condition?

199
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:43,666
We have completed switching out

200
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:46,416
the cockpit block
and put in a new body.

201
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,916
The armor's not complete.

202
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,583
But in my opinion
we can still use it.

203
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:52,208
What about the rest?

204
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:54,000
Well, on Mark Zex...

205
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,541
...the final few adjustments
should be completed soon.

206
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:58,875
I meant to talk
to you about that.

207
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:03,833
Lindwurm?

208
00:14:03,916 --> 00:14:06,250
Yeah.
It's Makabe's order.

209
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:07,708
According to him the Mark Elf

210
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:10,875
is more compatible with
Lindwurm than Mark Zex.

211
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:13,458
Is there something
wrong with it?

212
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:16,375
As pilots these others
are just hopeless.

213
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:19,083
It's unreasonable to expect
them to be like Kazuki.

214
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:20,250
Yeah.

215
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:28,416
What's the matter?

216
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:34,291
Oh, it's nothing.

217
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:39,791
What's the situation over there?

218
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:42,041
We are still at phase 32.

219
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:43,291
32?

220
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:44,791
You're behind schedule.

221
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:46,000
Yeah, I know.

222
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:47,500
But the Brunhilde
system remains on

223
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:49,958
cold-standby and
it's unable to start.

224
00:14:50,041 --> 00:14:51,041
What is the cause?

225
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:52,291
We don't know.

226
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:53,875
See if you can speed things up.

227
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:55,291
Right.

228
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:56,791
Look at the state
we've fallen into

229
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:58,875
without Commander Minashiro.

230
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:01,666
I hope I can be as good as him.

231
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:28,291
Great.
This is no good.

232
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:30,125
Do you think it
might be a defect?

233
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:32,083
Let's try changing
the whole engine.

234
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:34,041
That might be faster.

235
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:38,875
Kazuki?

236
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:11,541
Hey, wait, uh...

237
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:14,208
Access denied.

238
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:18,166
Your ID does not give you
clearance to the lower levels.

239
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:56,916
Dr. Kondo.

240
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,833
We just cleared phases
35 through 46.

241
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:02,750
We're able to fire
up the reaction hearth.

242
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:03,916
But how?

243
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,958
Why all of sudden?

244
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:09,041
Firing up the reaction hearth.

245
00:18:09,916 --> 00:18:11,666
Attention all island residents.

246
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,166
As of 10 a.m. tomorrow,

247
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:15,500
Tatsumiya Island
will start moving.

248
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:16,791
Repeat...

249
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:18,083
They're going
to move the island?

250
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:19,000
What's that?

251
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:21,166
No one even told me about this!

252
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:22,500
Me either.

253
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:25,000
Those bastards always
make decisions without us!

254
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:30,708
Miss Yumiko!

255
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:31,708
Hey... Sis!

256
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:32,625
Dr. Kondo.

257
00:18:32,708 --> 00:18:34,083
What is this?

258
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:35,375
I don't know.

259
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:38,541
The Brunhilde System
started up all of sudden.

260
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:41,083
A prophecy from Solomon.

261
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:44,791
Increase gravity pull to
120 at a heading of 9 o'clock.

262
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:46,375
The mass is increasing.

263
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,541
The two of you need
to get out of here.

264
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:50,583
What exactly's going on?

265
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:54,083
We're in a battle.

266
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:58,291
Solomon's prophecy
has determined

267
00:18:58,375 --> 00:19:00,125
that it's a Sphinx type.

268
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:03,666
What on earth's going on?

269
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:04,958
Is this still training?

270
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:07,250
Something's
different 'bout this.

271
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:18,000
Commander Makabe.

272
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:19,500
Neo U.N. plane spotted

273
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:21,541
at 6 o'clock,
60 kilometers away,

274
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:23,625
approaching
the island rapidly.

275
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,666
It will pass over the
island in about 25 minutes.

276
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:32,250
This has got to
be the worst timing!

277
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:34,333
Should we intercept
it on the island?

278
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:36,083
If we release the
Walle Shield, then we

279
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:38,958
may be discovered
by the search plane.

280
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:40,625
You think we should
change our course.

281
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:43,791
The sailing phase
is still at 73.

282
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:45,250
Commander!

283
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:47,666
I have an idea that might work.

284
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:52,458
It looks good.

285
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:55,083
I think that it's worth giving
this strategy of yours a shot.

286
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:56,083
All right then.

287
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:58,041
Take Mark Elf off standby.

288
00:19:58,125 --> 00:19:59,750
Do you know where Kazuki is?

289
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:03,208
He's heading up in an elevator
from underground block 34.

290
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:05,125
What's he doing here?

291
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:07,500
Kazuki!

292
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:10,041
You have to hurry up!

293
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:13,333
It's too dangerous.

294
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:15,291
We still haven't done
the matching test.

295
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:17,333
Nonetheless, we need him to fly.

296
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:20,125
I won't be responsible for this!

297
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:21,125
We have to.

298
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:22,791
It's the only way.

299
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:26,250
Alright then... hurry up with
the Mark Elf and Lindwurm Crest.

300
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:29,125
Yumiko, contact the
Neo U.N. plane.

301
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:32,333
Tell them Tatsumiya
Island is at Point N-0-2.

302
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:35,000
But that will put them in
contact with the Sphinx model.

303
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:36,041
That's right.

304
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:38,458
The Neo U.N.
plane will be our decoy.

305
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:41,083
Meanwhile,
we'll start moving the island.

306
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:46,666
All staff, report to stations.

307
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:48,583
LDA is unfolding.

308
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:50,833
Lock number one
and number two Gewitter.

309
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,833
Lock number three
and number four Gewitter.

310
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:54,583
Releasing Fafner cage.

311
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:57,583
Transfer AVC Lindwurm
to the turntable.

312
00:20:57,666 --> 00:20:59,375
Move the block.

313
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:07,458
Final safety check all green.

314
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:09,416
Secure Fafner
to the contact position.

315
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,500
Lock Contact Arm.

316
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,875
Fafner has made contact.]

317
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:20,791
Contact completed.

318
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:22,833
Contact completed.

319
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:27,708
But I'm telling you,
I've never even flown before.

320
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:29,875
There's no need to worry.

321
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:32,791
Together, I am sure
that we can do this.

322
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:36,458
Don't you agree with me?

323
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:40,250
Lindwurm System all green.

324
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:51,208
Start Lindwurm engine!

325
00:21:52,791 --> 00:21:53,916
Release Catapult.

326
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,416
All sections
operating normally.

327
00:21:59,083 --> 00:21:59,875
This is Lindwurm!

328
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:01,458
Take off!

329
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:05,583
Let's go!

330
00:22:10,833 --> 00:22:13,208
I wonder when it started...

331
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:16,708
...when people began to
forget how to fly in the sky.

332
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:18,125
No.

333
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,291
We didn't forget.

334
00:22:20,375 --> 00:22:22,375
We became scared.

335
00:22:22,833 --> 00:22:24,375
It's because the
sky on this planet

336
00:22:24,458 --> 00:22:27,041
doesn't belong to
people anymore.

337
00:22:27,666 --> 00:22:31,208
But now we're spreading
our wings in this sky again.

338
00:22:32,333 --> 00:22:37,291
♪ closing song ♪

339
00:23:42,375 --> 00:23:43,708
Truth.

340
00:23:45,541 --> 00:23:48,500
That time we took the
commemorative photo...

341
00:23:48,583 --> 00:23:51,250
Can we ever go back there?

342
00:23:52,041 --> 00:23:56,041
Next on "Fafner"
episode number four.

343
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:58,208
Departure.

344
00:23:59,916 --> 00:24:02,000
Are you there?
