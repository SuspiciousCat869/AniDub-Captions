Devil Rey to the runway.

All of the pilots'
vital signs are stable.

00:02:05,791 --> 00:02:07,458
We arrive
in four short hours.

11
00:02:07,541 --> 00:02:08,875
I hate to break it to you,

12
00:02:08,958 --> 00:02:11,125
but this flight might get
a little bit bumpy folks.

13
00:02:11,208 --> 00:02:13,708
So just sit back
relax, and enjoy.

14
00:02:13,791 --> 00:02:23,666
Right.

15
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:27,250
Devil Rey... Make your final
preparations for takeoff.

16
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:29,541
Attention all pilots
and personnel.

17
00:02:29,625 --> 00:02:31,125
Understand this.

18
00:02:31,208 --> 00:02:34,250
The purpose of this operation
is not to wipe out the enemy.

19
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:37,625
It is to rescue our colleague
who is being held captive.

20
00:02:37,708 --> 00:02:40,166
And it is also to bring back
information that could help

21
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:43,708
put an end to this long
battle once and for all.

22
00:02:44,416 --> 00:02:45,875
Tatsumiya Island will in no

23
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:47,833
way move from its
current coordinates.

24
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:51,833
We will remain here until you
all of you make it back safely.

25
00:02:51,916 --> 00:02:59,166
Kazuki Makabe, Maya Tohmi,
Kenji Kondo, Canon Memphis...

26
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,666
Our future...
is in all of your hands.

Take care of the children.

00:03:05,916 --> 00:03:06,708
Roger that.

30
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:08,750
Commence with Operation Azure!

31
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:12,375
Fafner units...
prepare to launch.

32
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:20,333
Maya...

33
00:03:20,416 --> 00:03:23,708
Don't worry.
They'll make it for sure.

34
00:03:23,791 --> 00:03:28,250
Those four...
will bring back our last hope.

35
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:31,708
Tsubaki!

36
00:03:32,791 --> 00:03:35,791
At least I had the chance
to see them all off...

37
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:37,791
...with my own eyes,
on the outside.

38
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:39,916
So I'm glad.

39
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,208
The pilots' brain waves
have crossed over.

40
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:52,291
They're showing up
as theta waves.

41
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:54,208
Although they're
about to go into battle,

42
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:55,791
everyone's
completely relaxed.

43
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:57,166
They're preserving their energy

44
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,291
in preparation for
the big fight.

45
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:01,041
Before we could
even bat an eye,

46
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:04,208
those little brats
turned into real adults.

47
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,833
Where are Kazuki and others now?

48
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,333
They traveled
outside the island's

49
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:12,833
range a little while ago.

50
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:15,666
They should be arriving at the
North Pole in a few hours.

51
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,958
Tsubaki, you should lie
down a little longer.

52
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:23,291
If I fall into a deep sleep
right now I'm positive

53
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:25,291
that I won't ever wake up again.

54
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:28,291
Am I not right Chizuru?

55
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:29,375
Yes.

56
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:31,041
But before that happens.

57
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:33,291
I should return your
body to the Coagula.

58
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:34,541
The Coagula.

59
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:36,416
We've detected
some abnormalities

60
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,125
in each of the island's blocs.

61
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:40,875
We've been unable to
stop the animals and plants

62
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:43,250
on the island from dying,
one after another.

63
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:46,666
The island's MIR's doing it
because it learned about death.

64
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,583
What does she mean by that?
What's going on?

65
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:51,875
The MIR which controls
all the island's functions

66
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,750
can acquire an infinite
amount of information.

67
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:57,750
It has learned about the cycle
of life and it's now trying

68
00:04:57,833 --> 00:05:01,291
to die along with Tsubaki
since she is the island's core.

69
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:05,166
Before I can go, I must
teach the MIR one last thing.

70
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:08,041
It must now learn to understand
that the end of a life,

71
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:10,666
gives rise to the
beginning of a new one.

72
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:13,333
Life and death are merely
extensions of each other

73
00:05:13,416 --> 00:05:15,041
and they continue on as one.

74
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:16,375
But wait.

75
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:19,291
The MIR is located
somewhere on this island, right?

76
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:21,791
And if that's what's
killing the island then...

77
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:24,375
She's right. Why don't
we just get rid of it!

78
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:26,958
Then Tsubaki won't have
to suffer anymore.

79
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:28,500
It's not that simple.

80
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:29,916
The air that you
are now breathing...

81
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,833
...is the MIR.

82
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:33,333
We're breathing the MIR?

83
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:36,125
The air that is within our
mirrored camouflage system...

84
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:38,416
...is basically
this island's MIR.

85
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,666
It exists living with us,
as a mass of gas that's

86
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:44,166
a part of the island,
and as it circulates,

87
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:47,000
it accumulates information.

88
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:48,500
It doesn't exist anywhere...

89
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:51,125
...and at the same time
it exists everywhere.

90
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:54,666
In other words, the MIR is this
island's environment itself.

91
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,333
The air?

92
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:59,791
But I thought the MIR always
took the form of a crystal?

93
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:01,958
When it met Fumihiko
and the others,

94
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:04,333
the island's MIR
began to change.

95
00:06:04,416 --> 00:06:06,833
That's when it started
to become a life form.

96
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:08,000
Isn't that right?

97
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:09,250
Yes.

98
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:11,625
The MIR once was indeed
a crystallized mineral.

99
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:14,541
But then it suddenly
evolved into a biosphere and

100
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:17,125
changed itself into
the air that surrounded us.

101
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:18,708
Biosphere?
What is that?

102
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:21,041
It's an independent
environment that's capable

103
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:23,416
of supporting many life forms.

104
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,000
That was the first step
towards co-existence

105
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:28,208
between Festum and humans.

106
00:06:28,291 --> 00:06:32,208
Eventually, when the MIR fully
understands the cycle of life,

107
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:35,250
then this island will
exist as Earth does.

108
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:37,333
It will be able to keep
us alive whether we're

109
00:06:37,416 --> 00:06:40,458
in space or at the
bottom of the ocean.

110
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:43,416
The reason I am able to control
everything on this island

111
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,750
is because the MIR
is the island's air.

112
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:48,416
And so I must now return to the

113
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:51,583
island's Coagula for
this same reason.

114
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:53,458
If I stay out here,

115
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:56,833
every being's life that
depends on this MIR...

116
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,583
...they will also die.

117
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:00,250
It can't be.

118
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:02,625
The MIR is still in the
process of growing up.

119
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:05,708
Little by little, it's learning
about life and death.

120
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:09,750
I can't stop the lesson before
I've finished teaching it.

121
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:11,041
But why you?

122
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:13,458
Why do you have to
sacrifice yourself, Tsubaki?

123
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:16,541
The bittersweet story...
the happiness and the sadness...

124
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:20,416
...that can only come from
having truly been alive...

125
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,166
I wanted to
experience that,

126
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:26,000
and this was the only
for me to do it.

127
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:27,916
The radar is picking
up a lot of activity.

128
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,666
Well, it's about time.
I'll lower our altitude.

129
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:35,166
They're so many of them.

130
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,958
And the skies are
filled with just as many.

131
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:41,416
The Neo U.N. put together quite
an impressive military force.

132
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,791
What if they still end
up getting defeated?

133
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:46,625
I guess it would mean the
end of the human race.

134
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:48,666
For those parties
joining the battle,

135
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,625
transmit your
authorization code.

136
00:07:50,708 --> 00:07:53,875
This is Tatsumiya Island's
Fafner unit reporting.

137
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:56,291
We decided to
join your little party.

138
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:57,958
So? You gonna
wish us luck?

139
00:07:58,041 --> 00:08:00,125
I trust you'll refrain
from attacking us.

140
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:01,875
We are on the
same side, after all.

141
00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:03,333
Yeah.
All right.

142
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:05,291
But the same goes
for you too, Barns.

143
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,791
Which means no friendly fire.

144
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:09,750
We have no intention of wasting
any of our bullets on you.

145
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:12,833
That said, each unit
will be acting independently

146
00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:15,041
which means you're
responsible for your own safety.

147
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:17,166
What? I don't quite follow you.

148
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:20,333
Because the enemy has mind
reading capabilities, it will be

149
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:23,250
far more effective if each
unit maneuvers on their own.

150
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:26,333
So we're not so much as fighting
with humans as among them.

151
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:27,875
Correct.

152
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:30,291
No one unit will be able to
anticipate another's actions.

153
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:33,875
In essence it's full scale
guerrilla warfare.

154
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:38,666
You've been approved.
You are now the 127th unit.

155
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:41,666
I wish you guys luck.
May we all survive.

156
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:44,625
How could they just abandon the
chain of command like that?

157
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:47,083
When you're launching an all
out war against the Festum,

158
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:49,125
this is the most
effective strategy.

159
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:52,000
Okay kiddos...
Did you hear the update?

160
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:53,041
Yes.

161
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:54,666
Don't worry.
It won't be a problem.

162
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,541
We can basically
do what we want, right?

163
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:59,375
I think it ends up being
more convenient for us.

164
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:01,375
We'll be arriving shortly.

165
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:04,000
Until then, I suggest you
go over your plan of attack.

166
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:07,541
Roger that. Kenji.
Will you do it?

167
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:09,125
You want me to do it?

168
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:11,083
You're student
council president.

169
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:13,000
Oh. Right.

170
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:15,458
Everyone take a
look at the monitor!

171
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:18,166
We will arrive at point A
and then proceed to point B

172
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:20,000
with the first round of weapons.

173
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:22,000
During that time
Mr. Mizoguchi'll prepare

174
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:24,625
weaponry reinforcements
and drop them at point B.

175
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:27,125
From there we will
enter enemy territory,

176
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:28,708
and contact Kazuki's mom.

177
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:30,458
I mean, the targeted core

178
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:32,541
to get information on
Soshi's whereabouts.

179
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:35,916
After we've rescued Soshi
we'll then head to point D.

180
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,833
Meanwhile
Mr. Mizoguchi and others

181
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:40,916
will transfer to a recovery
aircraft and wait for us there.

182
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,250
How was that?
All right?

183
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:44,416
You did great, Kenji.
Thanks.

184
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,041
Now, confirm our formations
would you Canon?

185
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:49,916
Why me? Aren't you
the squadron leader?

186
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,333
But you have more real world
fighting experience than I do.

187
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:54,750
Understood.

188
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:56,083
Will ya look it that.

189
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:57,916
Kazuki knows
what he's doing.

190
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,500
Huh?
He does?

191
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:03,000
This style of battle is unlike
any of their previous ones.

192
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:04,916
Everyone fighting
it is a commander,

193
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,250
yet at the same time
they are also just a soldier.

194
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:09,666
During the battles,

195
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:12,583
we will be using a four-in-one
cross dock formation.

196
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:14,625
Kazuki's Mark Sein
will take the lead,

197
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:17,125
while Kenji's Mark Acht
will be the right wing.

198
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:18,916
My Mark Drei will
be the left wing,

199
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,958
and Maya's Mark Sieben
will cover us from behind.

200
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:24,250
This may appear to be a
defensive formation,

201
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:27,041
but it actually concentrates
all of our firepower in the

202
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:30,291
front which is ideal when
making a forced entry.

203
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:32,541
Which means the strategy
calls for us to annihilate all

204
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:34,958
enemies in front of us, for
there is no looking back.

205
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:37,000
Our priority is
to reach that target.

206
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:39,291
Is this all right
with you, Kazuki?

207
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:41,083
Thank you, Canon.
Nice work.

208
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:42,541
Maya...

209
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:45,541
Before we begin will you
remind all of us once again

210
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:48,458
about the most important
aspect of this operation.

211
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:51,541
We will be stuck, unable to
perform any functions

212
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:53,250
or communicate
with each other...

213
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:56,125
If we happen to lose
even a single person.

214
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:59,875
So the important thing is...
that all of us make it back...

215
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:03,166
All five of us...
that's including Soshi...

216
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:05,875
...will return back
to the island!

217
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:09,708
Looks like it's begun.

218
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:15,375
The 168 missiles located around
the world are ready to be fired.

219
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:18,166
The probability for any unit to
evade the enemy's attack and

220
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:21,500
make it to the outer atmosphere
is thirty-seven percent.

221
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:23,833
That means more than
one-third of them will make it

222
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:27,000
to the enemy core that forms
the network in the sky.

223
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:29,333
That is truly wonderful.

224
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:31,291
I've been waiting
eagerly for this

225
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:33,708
for more than thirty years.

226
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:38,250
To the human race!
Victory shall be ours!

227
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:41,583
And to the mastermind
behind Heaven's Door.

228
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:43,666
May the fire from the
battles burn bright

229
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:46,208
enough to reach your
soul Dr. Mitsuhiro.

230
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:49,250
And may your
spirit rest in peace.

231
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:55,500
There.
It's the North Pole.

232
00:11:57,375 --> 00:11:58,708
There they are!

233
00:11:58,791 --> 00:12:01,291
We'll need cover from all sides.
Let's go get 'em, boys.

234
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:22,791
We'll drop the containers
in five seconds.

235
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:26,416
Kazuki, Maya, Kenji, Canon.

236
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,375
Come back alive.
And that is an order!

237
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:36,750
Verifying landing point!

238
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:38,833
I'm counting on you, Kenji.

239
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:45,000
Point A is all clear.

240
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:46,000
Here we go!

241
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:47,666
--Roger that!
--Roger that!

242
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:59,041
Here they come!

243
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:09,041
Kazuki! Kenji and
I will create a barrier,

244
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:09,916
then you break through.

245
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,791
Are you ready Kenji?

246
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:12,333
You bet!

247
00:13:42,708 --> 00:13:44,458
Nice shot there Missy!

248
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:45,833
Who would've guessed that I'd be

249
00:13:45,916 --> 00:13:48,125
the one needing
rescuing from you now?

250
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:09,208
Child of Alvis...
teach us the way to fight you.

251
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:13,875
Prepare yourself.

252
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:17,875
For you are now going to
destroy the humans of this land.

253
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:22,541
No...
K-Kazuki...

254
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:35,750
It'll be awhile
before the core's

255
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:38,041
re-synchronization
will be ready.

256
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:40,041
All right, then take
this time to prepare

257
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:43,041
Tsubaki Minashiro
for the operation.

258
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:44,666
It's times like these...

259
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,250
...I wish Ayano
were still here.

260
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:47,666
I'd imagine the battle at the

261
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:50,125
North Pole's already begun,
wouldn't you agree?

262
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:51,166
Yeah.

263
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:53,166
It sure is hard not
having any clue

264
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:55,875
how they're all doing
out there, huh?

265
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:57,875
Maya...

266
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:05,208
We're working on different
ways to transport you.

267
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:06,875
Hopefully one will work out.

268
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:08,250
Don't worry about it.

269
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:11,250
I'd like to walk there
with my own two legs.

270
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:13,875
Seri, Rina.
I guess this is it.

271
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:14,625
Good-bye.

272
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:15,875
No.

273
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:17,875
Please let us stay with
you 'til the very end.

274
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:20,750
We want to be there for you so
that we don't ever forget that

275
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:22,541
the reason we were
able to survive

276
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:25,041
was because of you, Tsubaki.

277
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:28,333
I thank you.

278
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,416
Kazuki!

279
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:33,875
Why you!

280
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:48,000
Those are pleiades-types!

281
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:49,083
But they're so many!

282
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:51,875
Everyone!
Tighten up the formation!

283
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:57,458
Their leader has taken
the one o'clock position.

284
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:15,000
Replace the units...
maintain efficiency.

285
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:17,916
Lure in the source of
the enemy's power.

286
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,208
And then, destroy them all.

287
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:23,541
That's right.
We will destroy all of them.

288
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:25,333
And you will help us.

289
00:16:25,416 --> 00:16:29,958
With the minimum number of
sacrifices, destroy the enemy.

290
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:32,208
Consider the amount
of sacrifices,

291
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:34,625
but destroy the enemy.

292
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:39,166
The enemy's
defensive line is retreating.

293
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:40,666
What do you think that means?

294
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,000
Could the Neo U.N.
be winning?

295
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:43,083
No.

296
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:44,833
Multiple enemy
units are alternating

297
00:16:44,916 --> 00:16:46,375
at the defensive front.

298
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:49,000
This is a part of the Festums'
systematic fighting method.

299
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:51,750
Before long, new units will
arrive and push us back.

300
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:55,000
But since the Neo U.N.'s not
fighting cooperatively...

301
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:57,333
They knew what they were getting
into from the beginning.

302
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:58,750
Alright we'll take advantage of

303
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:01,416
their retreat to
make our drop off.

304
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:05,125
We have arrived at Point B.
Release the containers.

305
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:13,083
Confirming their deployment.

306
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:16,375
Let's get out of here!
We'll be back soon enough.

307
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:21,500
There they are!
The new weapons!

308
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,125
Good old Mr. Mizoguchi!

309
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:26,625
It's exactly what we need.

310
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:47,500
From here on,
we'll truly be on enemy turf.

311
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:50,416
Let's do this!

312
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:03,208
Look at them.
They're all headed that way.

313
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:05,958
Do they not know that the
entrance is located over here?

314
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:07,083
Guess not.

315
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:08,333
And we have no way
of letting them know

316
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:09,708
about the information we have.

317
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:10,958
If we go forward,

318
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:13,791
hopefully someone
will notice and follow us.

319
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,041
Here we go!

320
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:31,791
What is this place?

321
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,500
By fighting together,
we'll defeat them!

322
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:47,458
The children of Alvis
have made it inside.

323
00:18:47,541 --> 00:18:51,791
What should we do?
How do we destroy them.

324
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:54,000
Don't let them work together...

325
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:57,291
Destroy... each one.

326
00:18:57,375 --> 00:18:59,416
Stop it!
No!

327
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,458
Don't!
Not the wound.

328
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:05,375
Tell us... how do we isolate
them from one another?

329
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,666
Pretend to be weak...
lure them in.

330
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:16,166
You must make some
sacrifices... to do this.

331
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:19,333
We understand and
will make it happen.

332
00:19:19,416 --> 00:19:22,166
We will use the hatred we've
learned from humans...

333
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:25,250
...to destroy the
children of Alvis.

334
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:27,291
W... wait...

335
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:33,083
We've completed the work
of linking Valkyrie's Coagula

336
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:34,500
to the rest of the system.

337
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:38,041
We can begin the core's
re-synchronization at any time.

338
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:45,708
The temporary connections
have checked out on all levels.

339
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:49,625
Okay Tsubaki...
we're finally ready for you now.

340
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:02,416
Tsubaki...

341
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:07,375
To perform the core's
re-synchronization,

342
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:09,791
we will be heading over
to the Valkyrie's Coagula.

343
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,208
Tsubaki, what are those things?

344
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:14,166
They are what connect
me to the coagula

345
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:17,125
and assimilate me with
the rest of the island.

346
00:20:17,958 --> 00:20:19,208
If it's all right with you,

347
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:21,291
would you please
let us hold them?

348
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:35,833
Kenji!

349
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:37,041
Canon!

350
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:47,791
What?

351
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:51,916
Kenji!
Canon!

352
00:20:56,416 --> 00:20:57,916
Kazuki!

353
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:06,291
Everyone...

354
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:10,750
Damn you!
Let go of me!

355
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:12,708
Kenji!

356
00:21:42,916 --> 00:21:46,000
Hey guys!
Is anyone under attack?

357
00:21:46,416 --> 00:21:48,958
W-Where is everyone?

358
00:22:05,541 --> 00:22:06,375
Tch.

359
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:08,500
I'm cut off from
the rest of 'em.

360
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,875
The enemy's strengthening
their defensive line.

361
00:22:32,958 --> 00:22:34,583
The units in the area as well as

362
00:22:34,666 --> 00:22:36,750
incoming reinforcement
units are being cut off.

363
00:22:36,833 --> 00:22:39,333
Keep advancing.
Retreat is no longer an option!

364
00:22:39,416 --> 00:22:41,625
Full speed ahead!

365
00:22:46,416 --> 00:22:50,208
I'm making it back alive.
No matter what!

366
00:22:50,291 --> 00:22:52,291
Are you there?

367
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:53,958
Before...

368
00:22:54,041 --> 00:22:56,375
I didn't exist
anywhere...

369
00:22:56,458 --> 00:23:00,041
But now it's different!
Because I am here!

370
00:23:05,625 --> 00:23:07,791
There is no way
I'm going to die!

371
00:23:07,875 --> 00:23:12,291
I won't die!
Do you hear me?

372
00:23:16,791 --> 00:23:19,708
Soon...
very soon...

373
00:23:19,791 --> 00:23:22,166
They will all understand.

374
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:23,458
But until then...

375
00:23:23,541 --> 00:23:25,041
...they can...

376
00:23:25,125 --> 00:23:27,458
...stay alive.

377
00:23:35,291 --> 00:23:38,791
The cycle of existence
and nothingness.

378
00:23:39,833 --> 00:23:41,666
Pulling the trigger...

379
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:44,125
...and choosing survival.

380
00:23:45,708 --> 00:23:46,916
I...

381
00:23:47,666 --> 00:23:50,500
I am going to disappear now...

382
00:23:51,875 --> 00:23:57,041
Next on Fafner...
the final episode.

383
00:23:57,125 --> 00:23:58,541
"The Sky."

384
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:00,708
Are you there?
