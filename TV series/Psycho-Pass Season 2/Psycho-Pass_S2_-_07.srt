[AOI] You were always the most
selfless child, focusing on

158
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:34,666
the needs of others
while neglecting your own.

159
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:37,666
I'm sorry if I caused
any trouble for you.

160
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,583
Don't be silly.
You've never caused me

161
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:41,875
even a single moment of trouble.

162
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:44,041
You know the value
of people's lives.

163
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:45,875
That every life has worth.

164

you must always hold on to.

[AKANE] Oh, Grandma.

Thanks so much.

169
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:03,250
[KASEI] I've already been
briefed on this case, Inspector.

170
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:04,791
[AKANE] Yes, well, I came
to see you to find out

171
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:07,083
what Sibyl is thinking.
I'm wondering why you

172
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:08,625
haven't yet taken any steps to

173
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:11,000
deactivate Inspector
Shisui's Dominator.

174
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:14,291
You must be following
her actions closely.

175
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:15,916
Of course we are.

176
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:19,500
However, by all measures
Inspector Shisui's

177
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:22,291
[KASEI] Psycho-Pass is
still registering as clear.

178
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:25,458
[KASEI] There's no reason
for us to prevent an Inspector

179
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:28,541
with a clear Psycho-Pass
from enforcing justice.

180
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:30,666
What you mean is that
you're not willing to do it,

181
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:31,833
[AKANE] because
you'd be admitting that

182
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:33,416
the system is flawed.

183
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,791
I highly suggest you watch
yourself, Inspector Tsunemori.

184
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:39,000
There's no way for us to
bring the bad guy to justice

[KASEI] You mean Kamui?

187

I've read through your
report quite thoroughly.

188
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:48,916
In it, you claim the Dominators
didn't even recognize him.

189
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,166
Yes.

190
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,666
[KASEI]
That's simply not possible.

191
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:55,291
It'd be one thing if he were
criminally asymptomatic,

192
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:57,041
but a person who
can't be scanned is

193
00:09:57,125 --> 00:09:58,916
an irregularity
that could never occur.

194
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,250
Yes, well, this
irregularity, you say

195
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:03,041
could never happen,
has happened.

196
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:05,916
[AKANE] So how are we
supposed to deal with him?

197
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,333
[KASEI] It's simple, really.

198
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:10,166
In fact, you already tried
to do it once, didn't you?

[AKANE gasps]

200
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:15,916

we should just kill him?

00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,166
Don't you now agree
it was a mistake for you

202
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,750
to restrain Enforcer
Togane on the dock?

203
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:22,750
[AKANE] It's strange.

of abnormal people who
were criminally asymptomatic.

207
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:33,166
And yet, when it comes to
someone as unique as Kamui,

208
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,750
all you want to
do is eliminate him

209
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:36,791
without any observation at all.

210
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:40,625
Seems to me you've already come
to a conclusion about him.

211
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:42,833
That Kamui is a type
of aberration you won't

what do you intend to do now?

216
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,791
I'll solve the mystery
of Kamui's condition.

217
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:56,250
And once that's done,
we'll arrest our suspect

[AKANE] and bring him to justice
under due process of law.

Well let's get started

on Kamui's trail after
losing him at the dock.

After his release,

Kamui might approach him.

[SHION] Will do.

311
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,458
[SHION] Plane went down
fifteen years ago in May.

312
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:20,291
It was carrying elementary
school kids for a class trip,

313
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:23,250
and it crashed
into Mount Kumataka.

314
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:25,791
It says there was a
problem with the airframe.

315
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:28,166
In total, there were
two hundred and two dead.

316
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:30,625
That includes pilots,
crew, chaperones--

317
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:34,000
and one hundred and
eighty-five children. Wait!

318
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:37,041
It looks like the
crash had one survivor.

319
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:38,791
[SHION] This student.

320
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:42,083
[AKANE] Kirito Kamui.

321
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:45,958
[intense music]

322
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:48,958
Kamui was the sole survivor.

323
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:53,041
[SHION] No go. Even with
the MWPSB's authority,

324
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:56,916
the server won't let us
access Kirito Kamui's records.

325
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,333
Apparently, it takes
medical confidentiality

326
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:01,333
more seriously than we do.

327
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:04,458
Check the doctors
who did his surgery.

328
00:16:04,541 --> 00:16:06,041
Let's see, the one
who'd probably know

329
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:08,375
the most about it is--Yes!

330
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:10,208
[SHION] The operating
surgeon is still alive.

331
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:11,750
[AKANE]
I'll go see him right now.

332
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:13,833
Inspector, please join me.

333
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:15,375
[MIKA] Very well, Tsunemori.

334
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:17,250
[AKANE] Thank you, Hinakawa.

335
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:20,458
Because of you, we finally
learned who Kamui really is.

336
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:22,416
[HINAKAWA] Oh. No problem.

337
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,083
[AKANE] While I'm gone,
continue creating Holos of

338
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:26,583
the hundred and
eighty-five children.

339
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:29,041
Each one aged-up
fifteen years, of course.

00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:30,416
What? You want all of them?

341
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:33,041
Are you having one
person do all that work?

342
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:34,666
It might help us
identify a third

343
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,500
or even a fourth Holo.

344
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:38,541
Well, Hinakawa, can you do it?

345
00:16:38,625 --> 00:16:42,500
Uh. I think I can.
If it'll help you, Big Sis.

346
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:44,708
Ms. Kunizuka, start
digging and find people

347
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:46,291
out there who may
have the same names

348
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:47,750
as the plane crash victims.

349
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:49,166
Yeah. You got it.

350

[AKANE] Mr. Ginoza and
Mr. Togane, use the organs we

351
00:16:51,416 --> 00:16:54,083
seized at Kamui's hideout
to identify the impersonators.

--[GINOZA] Understood.
--[SAKUYA] We're on it.

353
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:05,791
[MASUZAKI] I've completed
the preparations.

354
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:08,000
Once they arrive,
you and your people will

355
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:09,916
be able to use the Dominators.

That's perfect. Thank you.

357
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:14,458
Now all I have to do is
locate the one responsible

358
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:16,208
[KAMUI] for making
society the way it is.

Masuzaki, the MWPSB are here.

361
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:22,208
They'd like to speak with you.

362
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,208
[MASUZAKI] Show them in.

363
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:24,541

Yes, sir.

00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:26,500
Looks like they're here.

[KAMUI] I truly appreciate
your assistance.

Nonsense. I should
be the one thanking you.

Doctor Yohei Masuzaki, right?

Would you be

I fear I'm not the

able to do justice to

as soon as we get back,

please look into Kamui's
treatment history.

That really
necessary at this point?

[MIKA] We've got a witness now.

All we need to do is
pry the answers out of him.

If Kamui helps
the doctor maintain

00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:11,166
a clear Psycho-Pass
like the others,

382
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:13,375
he might lie during
the interrogation.

corroborate his story.

Eh... I guess you'll do.
Come on, gimme a hand.

[SHION] He suffered
from severe depression.

390
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:41,666
So the doctors put him
on meds and he wound up

391
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:44,083
becoming totally
dependent on the stuff.

392
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:45,791
[SHION] Poor thing.

393
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:48,708
[SHION] As a defense
mechanism, he focused on

394
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:50,791
developing his skills,
which is what helped him

395
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:53,875
become a Holo designer.
Isn't that adorable?

[KUNIZUKA] If that were
all there was to the story,

then he wouldn't have
had to become an Enforcer.

[HINAKAWA] Weird. The
authorization level for these

399

is set unusually high.

[MIKA] How should I know?
You take it from here.

402
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:12,750
[HINAKAWA] It's possible it
somehow involves patents for

403
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:15,125
medical devices or drugs
or something like that.
