the suspect on where
he made the bombs.

314
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:29,250
He led them to a
small rental office

315
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:31,375
in the back of the KT Building.

316
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,958
[MIKA] He slashed Inspector
Aoyanagi with a knife

317
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:36,666
he'd hidden in the
room ahead of time,

318
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,625
then retrieved some
pre-constructed bombs

319
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:41,000
and fled before we even
had a chance to respond.

320
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,666
He's still on the run.

How are you feeling now?

No way. You can't do that

and maintain a
clear Psycho-Pass.

324
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:56,250
[MIKA] We've advised
local residents to evacuate

325
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:59,166
and we've set up traffic
roadblocks on all streets.

326
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:00,916
Considering the amount
of time that's passed,

327
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,125
and that he's likely on foot,

328
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:04,541
we think Kitazawa's
still in the area.

329
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,708
[AKANE] There's a narrow
alley behind the Building.

330
00:17:07,791 --> 00:17:10,500
And down that is an
entrance to the sewers.

331
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:12,416
[MIKA] That's true.
But it's locked tight.

332
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,041
I don't see any way
he'd be able to access it.

333
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:17,916
[AKANE] Yeah,
but what if someone had

334
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,708
unlocked it beforehand?

335
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:21,750
[MIKA] Again, I don't
see how that's possible.

336
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:23,458
There's a scanner
right at the entrance.

337
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:25,250
Even if Kitazawa
did have an accomplice

338
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:26,916
to pick the lock
for him, that guy would

339
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,041
have been spotted immediately.

340
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:32,750
[KITAZAWA] Heh.

341
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:35,791
I see Kitazawa approaching
the sewer entrance.

342
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:38,208
And I have bad news, guys.
It's been unlocked.

[KUNIZUKA] You already figured
out Kitazawa's escape route?

350
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:54,708
Escaping in the middle
of a transfer isn't easy.

I can't see him
doing it without help.

Besides, there's
no way he could have

planted that weapon
while still in custody.

in my mind that someone on

through his entire escape.
