Thank you, Chief.
That's so incredible!

6
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:26,833
It's such a wise decision--
having the criminally

7
00:00:26,916 --> 00:00:29,833
asymptomatic judge others.

8
00:00:29,916 --> 00:00:32,000
Because of this
one fantastic idea,

we have a system that
protects every one of us!

the right course of action.

She really is the very

wouldn't you agree, son?

Yes, and her Hue still
remains crystal clear.

I'd say that makes
her your opposite.

Mother, if she's someone
who can help keep you pure,

32

then there's no reason
for us to color her.

33
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:08,750
We can use her in a
different kind of way.

34
00:02:08,833 --> 00:02:10,833
Oh? And how's that?

35
00:02:10,916 --> 00:02:13,125
Against Akane Tsunemori.

36
00:02:13,208 --> 00:02:15,416
We can color her black.

37
00:02:16,458 --> 00:02:17,833
Huh?

38
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:52,083
[AKANE] Mr. Saiga. Suppose
there's a perfect being

39
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:53,833
that judges people.

40
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:56,625
Is it possible to
then judge that being?

41
00:03:56,708 --> 00:04:01,000
A perfect being, huh?
Are you referring to a god?

42
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:07,541
What you just described
is the "omnipotence paradox."

43
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,375
[SAIGA] Here you go.

44
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,208
Can an omnipotent
being use his powers to

45
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:14,958
create a stone so heavy
even he can't lift it?

46
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:16,500
That's a paradox.

47
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:19,458
[SAIGA] Right. If a god with
infinite power creates a rock

48
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:21,708
that he cannot lift,
he ceases to possess

49
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:24,958
infinite power the very
moment the rock is created.

50
00:04:25,041 --> 00:04:27,875
And also, if he can't
create the heavy rock,

51
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:30,250
then he's not
all-powerful to start with.

52
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:33,375
In either scenario, it only
leads to a contradiction,

53
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:35,625
as does your initial question.

54
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:38,916
If the being who casts judgment
is perfect and infallible,

55
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,833
then it still must
judge itself as well.

56
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:45,875
Then is there any
solution to the paradox?

57
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:47,666
You can either find
a mistake somewhere

58
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:50,416
in the assumption,
process, or conclusion.

59
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,958
Or from the other
direction, you prove that

60
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:56,208
one of those three things
is actually correct.

61
00:04:56,291 --> 00:05:00,250
Find a correct answer,
or find a mistake.

62
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:01,625
Hmmm.

63
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:04,458
I'm wondering what got
you thinking about all this.

64
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:05,708
[SAIGA] I thought we
were just gonna have

65
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:07,458
a little chat about Sibyl.

66
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:15,625
[sighs]

67
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,083
[AKANE] "WC." "What color?"

68
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:27,166
You want to know
the color of Sibyl,

69
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:30,500
and also the color of yourself.

70
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:33,125
But what happens
if those two colors

71
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:35,583
turn out to be the same?

72
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:42,458
She asks me about
this world's god.

73
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:44,750
[SAIGA] I should tell her
these topics are dangerous

74
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:46,708
and to avoid
them at all costs,

75
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:50,083
and yet, I can't
wait to hear her answer.

76
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:53,083
[SAIGA] Huh. I'm pathetic.

77
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,291
Dependence.

78
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:02,416
[SAIGA] So this is
how Kamui's sympathizers

79
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,708
must have felt about their lot.

80
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:09,500
[footsteps]

81
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:10,958
Huh?

82
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:13,333
[MASUZAKI] Who are you?

83
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:16,083
[KASEI] It's been quite a
long time, Doctor Masuzaki.

84
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:19,583
I believe our last meeting may
have been at Kirito's surgery.

85
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:21,083
[MASUZAKI] Mmm.

86
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:23,666
I don't understand.
You're still alive?

87
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,458
Doctor Togane?

88
00:06:25,541 --> 00:06:27,791
[KASEI chuckles]

89
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:33,500
[AKANE] How do I solve
the omnipotence paradox?

90
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:36,166
[AKANE] Maybe the omnipotent
being doesn't have to be

91
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:38,625
omnipotent every single moment.

92
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:42,083
[AKANE] After creating
a rock he can't lift,

93
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:44,083
he then redefines
the parameters--

94
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:46,541
either lightens the rock
or strengthens himself.

95
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:49,083
There's still nothing
he can't do by the end.

96
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:50,666
That seems to
be the workaround

97
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:54,208
the Sibyl System's been
using. At least until now.

98
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:58,125
[AKANE] All this time,
by absorbing the

99
00:06:58,208 --> 00:07:01,250
criminally asymptomatic,
the people it couldn't judge,

100
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:04,000
it's been able to
maintain its perfection.

101
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:06,791
But now, Kamui's created
a new type of people

102
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:09,083
who are artificially
asymptomatic,

103
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:11,291
through his Psycho-Pass
manipulation.

104
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:13,375
In doing so,
he may have eliminated

105
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:15,250
that solution to the paradox.

106
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,916
[AKANE] And then, Kamui
takes it a step further,

107
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,583
and poses the question,

108
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:23,500
"Is Sibyl capable
of judging Sibyl?"

109
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:27,208
Because if it
can't judge itself,

110
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:30,166
Sibyl becomes an
exception to its own rules.

111
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,708
So like with society's
other exceptions,

112
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:36,958
Sibyl's only answer would be
to absorb Sibyl into itself.

113
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:39,083
And of course,
since that's impossible,

114
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:41,333
the perfection would be ruined.

115
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:44,041
Okay, so what if
Sibyl can judge itself?

116
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:47,041
That would avoid the
self-absorption paradox.

117
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:50,625
[AKANE] But if it could
judge itself, that would mean

118
00:07:50,708 --> 00:07:52,250
the minds that make up Sibyl

119
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:54,916
weren't criminally
asymptomatic, after all.

120
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,750
And that would mean Sibyl
failed to judge those people

121
00:07:57,833 --> 00:07:59,875
when it could have
in the first place.

122
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:05,083
[AKANE] I see just one
solution to this paradox.

123
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:12,333
[digital beeping]

[gasps]

125
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:21,000
Masuzaki had to have
been executed by a Dominator.

126
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:22,708
Well, it looks
like I've lost another

127
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:24,625
good conversation partner.

128
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:27,083
Since the murder
weapon was a Dominator,

129
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:30,250
[SAKUYA] it's safe to assume
this was Kamui's handiwork.

130
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:31,708
[gasps]

131
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:35,625
[SHION] Going back to around
twenty-two hundred hours

132
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:39,083
last night, the security
footage from the MWPSB's

133
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:42,583
cameras has been overwritten
with video from an earlier date.

134
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:43,916
So wait, now
they've managed to

135
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
get into the
MWPSB's system?

136
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:48,375
Yeah, and they weren't
all that stealthy about it.

137
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:50,083
They left some
sort of trace behind.

138
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:52,750
As you'll see,
it's pretty bizarre.

139
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:56,833
Doctor Masuzaki knew too much.

140
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:58,416
[SAKUYA] We have to
eliminate anyone who

141
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,708
knows my mother's secret.

142
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:04,125
So it really was
you who did this.

143
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:07,583
What's the matter?
Are you scared of me now?

144
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:11,458
[SAKUYA] There's no reason for
you to feel frightened here.

145
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:14,791
After all, I'm still
my mother's child.

146
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:17,416
That is to say,
the son of Sibyl.

147
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:22,291
[SAKUYA] My will
is society's will.

My eyes are society's eyes.

You've taken a vow,
Inspector, to respect the law,

150
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:28,958
which means you have no choice.

151

You can't defy me,
no matter how much

you may despise
latent criminals.

Fine, then what
do you want from me?

154
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:39,750
[SAKUYA] There's something
I'd like you to look into.

155
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:42,250
Find out where
Tsunemori's grandmother is.

156
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:43,833
Huh?

We'll help the Inspector

158
