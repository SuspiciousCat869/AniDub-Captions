To begin with,
tell me what it means.

00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,833
You deciphered
the message, right?

130

Yes. I figured it out after
hearing Kitazawa's final words.

something, will you?

stands for "What color?"

134

[SAIGA] What color?
Sure about that?

135
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:33,750
It's an odd question to
ask in this day and age.

136
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:36,458
[AKANE] Yeah, I know. If by
"color" they're referring to

137
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:38,458
a person's Hue,
then there's no reason

138
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:40,000
to ask anybody that.

139
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:43,125
Not when you can easily gauge
it yourself with a checker.

140
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:44,875
[SAIGA] And therein
lies our first puzzle,

141
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:47,333
for whom is this
question intended?

142
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:49,333
Is it someone at the
scene of the crime?

143
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:52,541
Or MWPSB personnel
who'd see it later?

144
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:53,625
Or maybe--

145
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:56,083
He's asking himself.

146
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:57,583
Hmmm...

147
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:01,875
One common factor
linking both messages

148
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,708
is that they each could've
only have been written

149
00:09:03,791 --> 00:09:05,375
by the Inspector who
was there at the site.

150
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:07,000
No one else had the access.

151
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:08,833
[AKANE] According
to Inspector Aoyanagi,

152
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:11,833
this has to be
the work of a ghost.

153
00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:13,625
A ghost who doesn't
know his own color,

154
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:15,875
so he has to keep
asking people what it is?

155
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:17,541
Quite a campfire story.

156
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:19,375
So what do you
make of all this?

157
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:21,250
You must have some thoughts.

158

00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:27,208
Messages that
can't possibly exist.

160
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:29,875
Whatever's happening, I intend
to get to the bottom of it.

161
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:31,791
I will. The problem is

162
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:34,333
I'm just not sure
where to begin.

163
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:37,375
And you think an old geezer
like me can offer advice?

164
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:39,083
I'm flattered.

165
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:43,791
[AKANE] You're the
only one who can help.

166
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:45,500
[SAIGA grunts lowly]

167
00:09:45,583 --> 00:09:47,916
All right, let's start
with the undeniable

168
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,250
facts of the case.

169
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:52,333
The evidence we can
be certain is real.

170
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:54,416
[AKANE] The message
written on the walls.

171
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,166
And Kitazawa's
Crime Coefficient

172
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:58,708
dropping rapidly
all of a sudden.

173
00:09:58,791 --> 00:10:01,291
[SAIGA] Very good.
Next we focus on the things

174
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:04,000
that are only conjecture
at this point.

175
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:06,625
Like the existence
of a message-writer

176
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:08,125
who can evade scans.

177
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:10,875
Or the man Kitazawa said
lowered his Coefficient.

178
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:12,375
"Kamui," he called him.

179
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:14,500
[SAIGA] Yes. Then regardless
of whether or not

180
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:17,166
this Kamui fellow
actually does exist,

181
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,875
we know for a fact
that both the person who

182
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:20,416
wrote the message,
and some means of

183
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:24,125
lowering Kitazawa's Crime
Coefficient must exist.

184
00:10:26,791 --> 00:10:30,458
[SAIGA] Tell me, do you know the
concept of "The Devil's Proof"?

185
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:32,375
[AKANE]"The Devil's Proof"?

186
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:36,958
As it stands, we have
no evidence that proves

187
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:40,166
the devil really exists,
but at the same time,

188
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:42,625
it's impossible to
prove that he doesn't.

189
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:44,708
[SAIGA] For now, we're
just spinning our wheels.

190
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:45,916
[AKANE] In other words,

191
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,625
if we can find even
the slightest proof that

192
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:50,541
Kamui's real, that gives
us a way to move forward.

193
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:53,083
Why does it suddenly feel
like I'm being recruited?

194
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:55,250
[AKANE] Inspector Shisui
from Division Two is acting

195
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:58,125
on her own, and we
don't know where she is.

196
00:10:58,208 --> 00:11:00,125
Surely you have some
insight into the matter

197
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:01,875
you'd be willing to contribute.

198
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:04,416
Are you not the man who
turned himself in out of guilt

199
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,833
for helping Mr. Kogami
when he went rogue?

200
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,666
Here's a chance to make amends.

201
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,291
Do you think I'm the
kind of person who can

202
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:13,458
be swayed by appeals
to the heart? Really?

203
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:15,458
You know the value of
doing whatever you can

204
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:17,458
in the face of
overwhelming odds.

205
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:19,541
I think you're
that kind of person.

206
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:22,833
You truly are an
excellent student.

207
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:24,833
You're a fantastic teacher.

208
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:30,708
[panting]

209
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:32,916
[footsteps]

210
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
[GINOZA] Wanna drink?
My dad left it behind.

211
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:39,916
[AOYANAGI] You're joking, right?
Remember I'm an Inspector.

212
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,125
[GINOZA] And a human being.

213
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:45,291
Are you okay?

214
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:49,375
"Okay"? How could you
possibly think I'd be okay?

215
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,625
[sighs]

216
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:55,375
Sorry, I snapped.

217
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:56,875
It's fine.

218
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:59,750
Just ten years as an Inspector,
they say, that's all,

219
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:02,375
then a Ministry of
Welfare job is yours.

220
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:04,458
Put in your time,
retire fat and happy--

221
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:06,708
that was the plan.

222
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:10,083
[AOYANAGI] It all sounded
so simple at the time.

223
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:11,666
[GINOZA] You're tellin' me.

224
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:12,791
Huh?

225
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:15,750
I tried that plan, too.
Now I drink.

226
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:18,750
[laughs lightly]
Least you can joke now.

227
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:20,208
Hmhm.

228
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:26,958
All I can do is think,
"Where did I screw up?"

229
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:28,750
Was it when I helped
you guys in Division One

230
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:31,083
allow Kogami to escape?

231
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:33,708
Or maybe it was
the time I shot him?

232
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:36,250
[GINOZA] "Him"?
You mean that Enforcer?

233
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:39,500
[GINOZA] You didn't
do anything wrong.

234
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:41,583
It's an Inspector's duty
to shoot an Enforcer

235
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:43,208
who's trying to run.

236
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:44,750
[sighs]

237
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:47,125
Our duty and feelings
don't always line up,

238
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:49,958
wouldn't you agree
with that Ginoza?

239
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:59,083
[AOYANAGI]
Sometimes I do wonder,

240
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:01,750
if I put a lid on whatever
was left of my feelings

241
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:05,750
the moment I squeezed
that Dominator's trigger...

242
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:07,083
[GINOZA] Lid?

243
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:08,958
[AOYANAGI] And now,
whether it's joy or sadness,

244
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:10,375
when my emotions start to rise,

245
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:11,708
the lid keeps them down,

246
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,041
locked away
somewhere deep inside.

247
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:15,708
Even in the rare
moments when I desperately

248
00:13:15,791 --> 00:13:18,083
want to feel something,
they won't come.

249
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:20,791
I'm nothing more
than an empty vessel.

250
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:23,166
That's where I'm at anyway.

251
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,833
[AOYANAGI] Sometimes, though...

252
00:13:29,666 --> 00:13:30,958
[AOYANAGI]
when I point a Dominator

253
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:33,791
and squeeze that trigger,
the lid starts to open

254
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:35,041
ever so slightly.

255
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:36,583
And just as I
sense that happening,

256
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:38,666
my rationality stops it.

257
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,416
[AOYANAGI] It's this
trait, above all others,

258
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,916
that makes me an Inspector.

259
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,875
[AOYANAGI] That time,
when I shot Kitazawa,

260
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:52,166
God, I almost enjoyed it.

261
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:54,416
That's on the edge, isn't it?

262
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:59,041
After everything,
all I have left is the job.

263
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:01,166
[AOYANAGI]
And I'm clinging to it.

264
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:04,375
Thanks for the drink.
Next one's on me.

265
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:07,666
[AOYANAGI] We should have
done something like this

266
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:10,083
together a long time ago.

267
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:18,666
The old Ginoza wouldn't
have had this drink with you.

268
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:22,750
[exhales deeply]

269
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:25,291
[digital beeping]

270
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,208
[AOYANAGI] Go ahead.

271
00:14:28,291 --> 00:14:30,416
[SHISUI] Inspector Aoyanagi.

272
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:32,791
It's me, Shisui.

273
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:34,291
[gasps]

274
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:40,125
An investigation into
the missing Division Two

275
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:42,958
Inspector, Shisui,
and into strange messages

276
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:45,375
you believe left by
an unknown suspect.

277
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:48,208
[KASEI] I see. And you would
like me to approve Division One

278
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:50,583
taking the lead
role on both cases?

279
00:14:50,666 --> 00:14:53,375
Yes, and on top of those,
we promise to still

280
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:56,208
handle our usual workload.

281
00:14:56,291 --> 00:14:57,750
[KASEI] You have my approval.

282
00:14:57,833 --> 00:15:00,333
[AKANE] Thank you for your
confidence, Chief Kasei.

283
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:02,833
[KASEI] Inspector Shimotsuki.
You're dismissed.

284
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:04,750
[MIKA] U-Uh...
You want me to leave?

285
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:08,250
[KASEI] I need to speak with
Inspector Tsunemori. Alone.

286
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:11,041
[MIKA] Understood.
Good evening, ma'am.

287
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:16,750
Tell me, what do you
really think is happening

288
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:18,625
with these W-C cases?

289
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:20,958
My question first.
Is there any way someone

290
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:23,375
could exist whom
Sibyl can't see?

291
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:26,416
That would be
completely impossible.

292
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,708
The angle of your
question answers my own

293
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:30,875
about your thoughts
on these cases.

294
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:33,208
[AKANE] Do you
doubt my sanity, too?

295
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:35,625
[KASEI] That would be the
normal judgment of Sibyl,

296
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:39,375
but you are also presenting
an interesting situation.

297
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:42,125
Can someone lose her
sanity when her Psycho-Pass

298
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:43,750
remains crystal clear?

299
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:46,833
[AKANE] If you want to sit
back and watch, be my guest.

300
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:49,250
Don't go just yet.
I have a question about

301
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:51,750
Division One's new personnel.

302
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:57,666
[KASEI] Specifically, the
new Enforcer. How's he doing?

303
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:01,458
[AKANE] Enforcer Togane
or Enforcer Hinakawa?

304
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:04,333
[KASEI] Sakuya Togane.
I'd like you to report on

305
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:06,916
his performance to me
as often as possible.

306
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,416
Why's that?

307
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,958
[KASEI] Although the results
have since been erased from

308
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:12,666
the official report,
testing revealed him to have

309
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:16,583
the highest Crime Coefficient
ever seen in our society.

310
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:17,833
[gasps]

311
00:16:17,916 --> 00:16:20,083
[KASEI] He's a useful
model case for us.

312
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:23,333
Exercise caution
in how you treat him.

313
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:28,250
[AKANE] I know this is
asking a lot of all of you,

314
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:30,458
but we've already
got one dead Enforcer,

315
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:32,291
one missing Inspector,

316
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:35,041
and a Dominator that
we are unable to locate.

317
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:37,666
This is not a case we
can afford to leave alone.

318
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:39,375
What's your real goal here?

319
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:41,000
My gut tells me this is about

320
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,208
pulling the sheet
off of your ghost.

321
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:46,125
[GINOZA sighs]

322
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:48,708
Don't let this investigation
become too personal.

323
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:50,625
I'm going to ask Ms.
Karanomori to provide

324
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:53,583
assistance, too. I
appreciate your cooperation.

[sirens]

326

[FEMALE ANNOUNCER] Elevated
Area Stress Level warning.

327
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,250
A Psycho-Pass above
the regulation value...

328
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:01,458
[MIKA] I've got this.
Ms. Kunizuka, Hinakawa.

329
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:02,625
Come with me.

330
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:03,791
--[KUNIZUKA] Okay.
--[HINAKAWA] Uh, okay.

331
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:05,041
[FEMALE ANNOUNCER]
The on-duty Inspector...

332
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:06,958
There's no way
this Kamui is real.

333
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:10,625
But by all means, go ahead and
keep chasing after your ghost.

334
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:12,125
Inspector.

335
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:14,000
[FEMALE ANNOUNCER] A Psycho-Pass
above the regulation value

336

has been detected inside...

337
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:17,166
[AKANE] We should
get started now, also.

338
00:17:18,583 --> 00:17:21,583
I completed a thorough
analysis of the crime scene,

339
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:25,250
but nothing even remotely
suspicious stuck out to me.

340
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:28,291
[AKANE]
Suppose Kamui does exist.

341
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:30,166
He pretended to be
a hostage in order to

342
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,250
lure out the MWPSB.

343
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:35,333
Then killed an Enforcer
and abducted an Inspector.

344
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:38,125
But why do that?
What's his goal?

345
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:40,375
And what does
that message mean?

346
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:44,000
Why did he set his
sights on me of all people?

347
00:17:44,083 --> 00:17:47,583
[GINOZA] Watch yourself.
You're becoming obsessed.

348
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:50,791
[SAKUYA] Inspector Tsunemori
is gonna be just fine.

349
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:54,375
It'd take a lot more than
this to cloud that woman's Hue.

350
00:17:58,125 --> 00:18:00,750
[MAN] Now's the time to
put the lessons we've learned

351
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:03,375
to good use, and
finally implement some

352
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:05,416
much-needed new policies!

353
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,416
Policies that will
improve each and every one

354
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:11,083
of our citizens' lives!
But in order to do so--

00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:21,416
[MALE SUPPORTERS laughing]

356
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,833

a wonderful speech, sir.

[MIKA] There's been
deterioration in your Hue.

360
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:37,583
You need to undergo
emergency therapy at once.

00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:39,375
Please come with us.

362
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:42,625
What? There must
be some mistake!

363
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:44,500
[MIKA] Hinakawa, restrain him.

364
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:50,833
Now that's how an
operation is supposed to go.

365
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:53,958
So what does the Chief
see in someone like her?

366
00:18:57,041 --> 00:18:59,416
[MALE ENFORCER 1] So, that's
where Inspector Shisui is?

367
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,958
Yeah, she told me so herself,
believe it or not.

368
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:08,208
I want you guys to
stay out here for now.

369
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:09,958
We don't want to
cause a scene, okay?

370
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:11,541
--You got it.
--Sure thing boss.

371
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:29,750
[MAN] No! That won't work!
Medication can't save anyone!

00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:32,250
It changes nothing! Nothing!

But, sir, please.

00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:35,375
You all need
to open your eyes.

If you truly want to
be saved don't turn to

376
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:39,916
the drug companies.
They won't save you.

I can save you people.

00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:09,375
Look.

388
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:10,916
Did you find something?

389
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,291
[AKANE] The Drones sent to
defuse the bombs at the location

390
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:15,625
where the first
message was found.

391
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:17,375
One of them somehow
turned up far away

392
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:18,875
from the crime scene.

393
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:21,083
And it had to be sent
in for maintenance.

394
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:27,000
Invoice says it was
missing a part. That's funny.

395
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:29,000
It looks like the impact
absorber that had been

396
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:31,958
installed in it must've
been removed at some point.

It just mysteriously
disappeared.

I have a hard time
believing that piece just

wandered off all on its own.

400
