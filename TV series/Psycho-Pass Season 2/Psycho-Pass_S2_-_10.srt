[AKANE] It's the
omnipotence paradox.

242
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:27,916
The reason why Kamui's
been doing all of this

243
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,916
is to judge the Sibyl System.

244
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,583
And I believe you should
welcome that judgment,

245
00:13:32,666 --> 00:13:35,500
since it will allow
you to judge him as well.

246
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:38,250
[AKANE] You've tried to create
this perfect system of justice

the very people you
weren't able to judge.

249
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:47,666
However, a new exception
has presented himself.

250
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:51,125
[AKANE] Kamui exists
as a collective entity,

251
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:53,500
not as an individual.

252
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:56,416
In order to judge him,
Sibyl has no choice but to

253
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:59,375
accept the concept
that defines him.

254
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:01,291
[KASEI] You don't
understand, Inspector.

255
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:03,500
To evaluate someone
like him, we'd need to

256
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:06,125
measure his Psycho-Pass
as a collective entity.

257
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:08,291
But if we changed
the judgment parameters

258
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:10,125
to make that possible...

[AKANE] Sibyl,
another collective entity,

to judgment, too.

That was his goal all along.

262
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:19,125
By making himself
a threat to society,

263
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:21,166
he creates a situation
where you're forced to

264
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:23,458
acknowledge a
collective Psycho-Pass,

265
00:14:23,541 --> 00:14:25,708
which then presents a paradox.

266
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:29,291
And the solution to it
enables him to judge you.

267
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:32,583
[KASEI] All the more reason
why we mustn't allow this man

269
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:36,041
[AKANE] And to stop Kamui,
you would kill him

270
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,291
without judging him?

have to pay once it began
