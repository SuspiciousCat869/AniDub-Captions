[MAN breathing heavily]

00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:35,666
[MAN] The medicine they've
been pumping you full of here

00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:37,458
may keep your Hue under control.

6
00:00:37,541 --> 00:00:39,916
But at the same time
it gradually robs from you

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,875
the feeling of being alive.

[FEMALE whimpers]

10
00:00:51,041 --> 00:00:53,708
I will free you from the
tyranny of this false choice

11
00:00:53,791 --> 00:00:55,875
that you've been presented with.

12
00:00:55,958 --> 00:00:58,541
[MAN] Just as Kamui does.

13
00:00:59,708 --> 00:01:01,875
[MASUDA] If you help me, I
can make it worth your while.

14
00:01:01,958 --> 00:01:03,958
Tell you what.
I'll put in a good word

15
00:01:04,041 --> 00:01:05,208
at the Ministry of Welfare.

16
00:01:05,291 --> 00:01:06,791
All that you have
to do is call Kamui

17
00:01:06,875 --> 00:01:07,916
and let me speak to him--

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,708
Inspector Shimotsuki.
Please bring

19
00:01:09,791 --> 00:01:11,958
Representative Masuda
back to the station.

20
00:01:12,041 --> 00:01:14,083
I'll handle
the interrogation.

21
00:01:14,166 --> 00:01:15,708
And why is that?
Because you don't want someone

22
00:01:15,791 --> 00:01:18,458
who doubts the existence
of Kamui to do it?

23
00:01:18,541 --> 00:01:20,333
It's because I want
him questioned based on

24
00:01:20,416 --> 00:01:24,458
the evidence acquired at
the scene and nothing else.

25
00:01:24,541 --> 00:01:26,583
Fine. "Yes, ma'am."

26
00:01:28,791 --> 00:01:30,875
I doubt it's
a coincidence, but--

27
00:01:30,958 --> 00:01:33,041
we need more to
go on or else...

28
00:01:33,125 --> 00:01:35,583
we'll end up like
we did with Kitazawa.

29
00:01:35,666 --> 00:01:37,541
[AKANE] Take a look at this.

30
00:01:37,625 --> 00:01:40,541
It's the space where the
impact absorber was removed.

31
00:01:40,625 --> 00:01:42,416
A person could probably
squeeze into there

32
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,875
without too much trouble,
don't you think?

33
00:01:44,958 --> 00:01:47,583
I guess so. Somehow
that Drone wound up

34
00:01:47,666 --> 00:01:50,083
two kilometers away
from the crime scene.

35
00:01:50,166 --> 00:01:52,708
Drones malfunction,
sometimes on their own.

36
00:01:52,791 --> 00:01:54,291
If someone tampered with it,

37
00:01:54,375 --> 00:01:56,166
there would be some
kind of record of that.

38
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,458
[AKANE] So the fact that there's
not suggests that Kamui has

39
00:01:58,541 --> 00:02:01,166
a way of hacking into a
Drone's logs to alter them.

40
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:02,583
You're committed to
this theory that he's

41
00:02:02,666 --> 00:02:04,208
actually out there somewhere.

42
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:06,583
[AKANE] You don't support the
direction this case is taking?

43
00:02:06,666 --> 00:02:09,583
No, ma'am. I'm happy
to play along with you.

44
00:02:09,666 --> 00:02:10,875
[SAKUYA] Hmmhm.

45
00:02:10,958 --> 00:02:12,625
[AKANE] This was deliberate
and premeditated.

46
00:02:12,708 --> 00:02:14,416
And while we're spinning
our wheels looking for

47
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:18,000
definitive proof, Kamui's
free to plan his next move.

48
00:02:18,875 --> 00:02:19,916
So yeah.

49
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,541
You could say I'm committed.

50
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:24,125
I have no doubt. Kamui is real.

51

53
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:02,541
The whole
building's a dead zone.

54
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:04,500
That's weird. Is this common?

55
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:07,250
[SHION] No, it usually only
happens after a big disaster,

56

like a fire or something.

57

to be the case here.

bit, that's all it is.

fear and confusion do tend

to spread easily within mental
care facilities, but still.

Oh, come on, seriously?

You think even a
routine call like this

is too much for
a junior Inspector?

Hm.

order to maintain a clear Hue,

you relied on a man named Kamui.

How did you first come
into contact with him?

And what means do
you use to communicate?

So far, there are no incident
reports from this location.

But the Area Stress
Level--well, it's increasing.

144
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:13,166
Then simple deduction
says this place

145
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:14,625
has to be the source.

146
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:16,541
Why don't we just
force our way in?

No go. First things first.

We gotta find out what's
causing the stress increase.

If we were to
simply release them,

we could make a bad

00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:44,583
We're chasing a ghost.

318
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:46,500
But even if you
can't see a ghost,

319
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:49,791
that doesn't mean you can't
still follow its trail.

320
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:52,166
[DOMOTO] Division three.
We are good to go!

321
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,083
Uh...

322
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:00,750
[shrieks]

323
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:03,291
[whimpers]

324
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:06,458
[MAN] Foolish MWPSB.

325
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:12,791
[AOYANAGI shaky breathing]

326
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:18,458
[AOYANAGI] I am an Inspector.

327
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,625
Aaahhh!

328
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:23,166
[MAN yells]

329
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:29,333
We got an elevated stress
level warning for the building.

330
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:30,666
There's no way
they'll be able to

331
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,833
keep their Psycho-Passes
stable now.

332
00:16:32,916 --> 00:16:35,333
An experiment. Kamui's
set up the entire thing

333
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:37,875
as a way to learn
how to use a Dominator.

334
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:41,708
But he's already used
one on Enforcer Yamatoya.

335
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:44,958
[AKANE] If he anticipated
the MWPSB surrounding him,

336
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:46,708
then his plan
this time isn't to be

337
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:48,541
the one pulling the trigger.

338
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:50,125
[GINOZA] You think he's
trying to get someone else

339
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:51,833
to do his killing for him?

340
00:16:51,916 --> 00:16:53,833
That's a pretty
roundabout strategy.

341
00:16:53,916 --> 00:16:55,958
Who the hell does he want to--

342
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:57,416
[gasps]

343
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:12,416
[grunts]

344
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,125
[muffled groans]

345
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:21,875
[AOYANAGI] To protect these
people and uphold the law,

346
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:24,000
I will enforce you--!

347
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:31,291
[HOSTAGES scream]

348
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:33,458
They shot right
through the wall.

349
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:37,500
[DIVISION 3 INSPECTOR] That's
the MWPSB's latest weapon:

350
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:39,125
The Assault Dominator.

351
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:41,125
When there's a wall
between us and the target,

352
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:44,541
this creates a hole.
Looks like it worked well.

353
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:45,833
"It worked well"?

354
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:47,916
What about the
remaining people in there?

355
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,166
Doing something like that
can stress them out so much

356
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,875
that it triggers
Eliminator mode!

357
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:55,083
Ms. Kunizuka, please stop.

358
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:59,083
Hey, I'm only following
the orders I was given.

359
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:01,666
[DIVISION 3 INSPECTOR] You
sure you got the right guy?

360
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:04,625
Don't know. Whoever
had the higher number

361
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:06,625
was who I enforced.

362
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:13,708
[HOSTAGES whimper and scream]

363
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:15,791
[MALE HOSTAGE]
He's killing everyone!

364
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,416
[DOMINATOR] Crime Coefficient,
three hundred twenty-two.

365
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,500
Enforcement mode:
Lethal Eliminator.

366
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:24,833
Now what the
hell is this number?

367
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:27,166
[screaming and crying]

368
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:29,916
[DOMINATOR] Enforcement mode:
Lethal Eliminator.

369
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:33,500
They're all targets!
Enforce them!

370
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:41,666
[panting]

371
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:47,125
[KUNIZUKA] My God.
We have to stop them!

372
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:50,583
[MIKA] I can't. This isn't
Division One's case anymore.

373
00:18:50,666 --> 00:18:53,958
I have no power now.
They won't listen.

374
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:58,708
[police sirens]

375
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:06,333
Stop it!

376
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:10,083
What is going on?

377
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,041
[AKANE] What did you do?

378
00:19:16,541 --> 00:19:18,666
[KAMUI] Seems we've
answered my question.

379
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,875
Inspectors can be
judged by the Dominators,

380
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:22,750
same as anyone else.

381
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:24,000
Thank you, friend.

382
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:26,791
Because of your help,
we've taken a big step

383
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:28,458
in the right direction.

384
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:32,333
Follow me. I have our
escape route planned.

385
00:19:33,916 --> 00:19:35,833
[MAN] After all
that's happened today,

386
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:38,416
I wonder what my color is.

387
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,416
When I first became
familiar with you,

388
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,791
I was a zombie, whose life
had been robbed of all color

389
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:46,208
because of a sickening
eustress deficiency.

390
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:49,541
But now, I'm as
different as I am healthy.

391
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:53,166
I was finally able to
repossess my own existence!

392
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:56,666
Please let me stay behind.

393
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:58,166
[sighs]

394
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:02,041
I have done all I can do.
My work here is now finished.

395
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:05,458
[MAN] But you...
You can change the world.

396
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:09,458
I'm glad I met you,
Kamui. Thank you.

397
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:20,916
[KAMUI] Can you see it?
The color of the blood we shed?

398
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,166
Why don't you tell me
then, what color we are.

399
00:20:29,541 --> 00:20:30,916
[GINOZA shudders]

400
00:20:37,583 --> 00:20:41,541
[GINOZA] It can't be. Aoyanagi.

401
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:43,041
[SAKUYA] Inspector!

402
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:49,416
[AKANE] This question.
I think he's directing it

403
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,875
at society itself.

404
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:53,250
[SAKUYA] Each of us.

405
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:56,708
For us to question
our colors, and also--

406
00:20:57,458 --> 00:21:01,583
[KAMUI] Sibyl.
What color are you?
