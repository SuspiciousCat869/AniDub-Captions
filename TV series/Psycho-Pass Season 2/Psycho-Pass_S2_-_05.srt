00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:34,125
Besides, aren't you curious...

159
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:35,958
...to see how
she'll be affected

160
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:38,541
when confronted by "that"?

161
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:41,666
[AKANE] We'll be arriving soon.

162
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:45,416
It's a site where
they test Military Drones.

163
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,791
[AKANE] Our mission is
strictly to investigate.

164
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:49,708
However, as a
precautionary measure,

165
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:52,291
risk level B weapons
will be permitted.

166
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:54,833
In addition, this is a
joint operation between

167
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:56,958
Division One and Division Three.

168
00:09:57,041 --> 00:09:59,333
I expect all Enforcers
to be mindful of

169
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:02,416
the situation and obey
any order given to you,

170
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,000
regardless of
whether it comes from

171
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:06,875
your own lead
Inspector or another one.

172
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:09,791

whole life without

174
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:13,541
[MIKA] Inspector, is there
a reason you need to take

175
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:15,291
so many people with you?

176
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:18,833
[AKANE] The personnel allotment
was dictated by the Chief.

177
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:21,375
Between the
interrogation of Masuda,

178

[MIKA] and the analysis of
the barricade incident site,

Holo examination

181
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:28,875

it's about to topple over!

183
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:32,416
[AKANE] I assigned everyone
only what I thought

184
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,416
they could handle. Did I
overestimate your abilities?

185
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,916
[MIKA] I'm just saying
there's a whole lot of stuff

186
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,458
for us to deal with.

187
00:10:38,541 --> 00:10:40,416
Besides, the Drones have
already gone over every inch

188
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,583
of that place looking for
evidence, haven't they?

189
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:44,125
[AKANE] Some things
you can only learn by

190
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:45,958
seeing them with your own eyes.

191
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:48,250
Seriously? That way of
thinking is so archaic.

192
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:49,916
[AKANE] You know, the
newest methods and ideas

193

We're here now. I've gotta go.

It's the Ministry of Welfare.

Representative Masuda

199
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:05,500
now that his Hue is improving.

200

Here, take a look for yourself.

201
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:11,000
[KUNIZUKA] No matter
how you look at it,

202
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:13,416
someone's putting
pressure on us.

203
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:16,250
The enduring greatness of
Japanese society has always

204
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:19,458
been held aloft by the strength
and vitality of its...

205
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:21,750
Much as we might like,
we can't refuse a request

206
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:23,625
from the Ministry of Welfare.

207

dumb, we can probably only

buy ourselves a day
or two at the most.

[MALE ENFORCER] This area used
to be a major trading port.

211
00:11:33,708 --> 00:11:37,083
After that closed, it became
an unmanned storage yard.

212
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:40,666
[MALE ENFORCER] Then, the
Ministry of National Defense's

Division set up shop.

00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,625
[MAN] We have more than
enough room for the Drones,

215
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:53,333
as well as parts and
supplies for their servicing.

216
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:56,958
And being mostly unmanned,
makes accidents very unlikely.

[MAN] There's no safer
place for troubleshooting

and activating Military Drones.

219
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:05,583
Interesting.

Whoa!

Wow. It's been a while!

So when did you
get back on the job?

I'm an Enforcer

sit tight until we get orders.

pain in the ass.

241
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:20,291
[SAKUYA] According
to the crew chief,

this is a restricted area.
Authorized personnel only.

you still have your doubts?

It's true--scans haven't
detected anyone here

besides the staff.

[AKANE] However, cymatic scans
are meaningless to a ghost.

True. What he'd need to be
careful about are human eyes.

248
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:44,041
[AKANE] He'd want a place
where scanners are installed,

249
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:46,458
that's also deserted.

Its emergency exits are placed
here on this street face.

254
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:03,625
So then, wouldn't it also
make sense for the building

[SAKUYA] next to it to
have something other than

00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:10,041

unnecessary wall.

Comfortably within the

[MIKA] With all due respect,

Her rough, hands-on approach.

An obsession with flimsy clues
that's distorting her thinking.

And her use of Enforcers.

Those are just some
of the areas in which

[KASEI] And your point is?

[MIKA] I believe that helping

No. There's one more thing.

may have simply wanted to know

if the Inspector's
mental state was healthy.
