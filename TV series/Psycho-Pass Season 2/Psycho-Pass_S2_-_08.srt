00:00:14,041 --> 00:00:15,791
[MIKA] Mika Shimotsuki,
Criminal Investigation

2
00:00:15,875 --> 00:00:17,375
Department, Division One.

3
00:00:17,458 --> 00:00:19,166
Requesting permission
to enter the Ministry of

4
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:21,458
Economy Patent
Office's archive room.

5
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:27,833
[MIKA] Patents owned
by the Togane Foundation.

6
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:32,625
There it is.

7
00:00:32,708 --> 00:00:34,375
[MIKA] The patent
applications that were filed

8
00:00:34,458 --> 00:00:36,875
based on Kirito
Kamui's surgery.

9
00:00:38,666 --> 00:00:41,958
[MIKA] Multi-body transplant?
A surgery to join pieces of

10
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:43,875
a hundred and
eighty-four bodies?

11
00:00:44,791 --> 00:00:47,000
[MASUZAKI] The children
from the plane crash,

12
00:00:47,083 --> 00:00:49,083
their bodies were
cut up into pieces,

13
00:00:49,166 --> 00:00:52,000
and those pieces were
then implanted into a boy.

14
00:00:52,083 --> 00:00:54,791
Mmm. And that boy was Kamui?

15
00:00:54,875 --> 00:00:56,541
He's more than one boy now.

16
00:00:56,625 --> 00:00:58,708
He has the personalities
and body fragments of

17
00:00:58,791 --> 00:01:01,583
one hundred eighty-four
people, the brains of seven.

18
00:01:01,666 --> 00:01:04,083
He's a collective,
the sum of all those parts.

19
00:01:04,166 --> 00:01:05,750
I must say I'm
surprised to learn a

20
00:01:05,833 --> 00:01:08,250
multi-body brain
transplant is even possible.

21
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:10,041
To be perfectly honest,
I had pegged the

22
00:01:10,125 --> 00:01:12,791
odds of success for this
surgery at close to zero.

23
00:01:12,875 --> 00:01:16,166
And if asked to do the procedure
again, I probably couldn't.

24
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:19,583
And yet... somehow he survived,

25
00:01:19,666 --> 00:01:21,666
and has gone through
life with a Psycho-Pass

26
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:24,208
that cannot be
measured by any means.

27
00:01:24,291 --> 00:01:26,958
[MASUZAKI] He lives but, to the
scanners and the Dominators,

28
00:01:27,041 --> 00:01:30,500
he's nothing but
a jumble of corpses.

29
00:01:30,583 --> 00:01:33,125
So that's how Kamui does it.

30
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,833
Immediately
following the surgery,

31
00:03:06,916 --> 00:03:09,000
Kamui still appeared
to be a normal human

32
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:11,875
[MASUZAKI] and the scanners
were able to recognize him.

33
00:03:24,083 --> 00:03:26,333
[MASUZAKI] He told me that he
first realized he was different

34
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:28,666
once it was finally
possible for him to go out

35
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,041
into the world and
live a normal life.

36
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:33,583
As the implanted parts
began to fully integrate

37
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:36,166
with his body, the
scanners recognized him

38
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,666
[MASUZAKI and KAMUI]
less and less--

39
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,916
[KAMUI] As time went by,
I turned into a ghost,

40
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,583
cut off from society.
I was there, but not really.

41
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:47,625
At first, I sought recognition.

42
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:50,125
I purposely committed
crimes to change my Hue,

43
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:52,750
hoping to attract attention
and be judged as real.

44
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:54,083
Mmm.

45
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:55,875
[KAMUI] I sought
help from people, too,

46
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:58,458
from doctors and counselors
I thought I could trust.

47
00:03:58,541 --> 00:04:01,083
But, as soon as they
witnessed my anomaly

48
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:03,416
with their own eyes,
they were all out the door.

49
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,958
Yes, I can see the dilemma.

50
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:07,166
Working with a person who
isn't recognized by Sibyl

51
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,541
would be a terrifying thing,
as it would undermine

52
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:11,708
the very foundation
of this society.

53
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:13,458
It wasn't just
Sibyl ignoring me.

54
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:15,333
My existence was
denied by pretty much

55
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:17,500
every person I came
into contact with.

56
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:19,916
Why was I being cast
aside by all these people?

57
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,708
Why did I have to disappear?
I searched high and low

58
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:25,333
for the reason until
finally I found it.

59
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:28,791
It was the Season of Hell.

60
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:31,750
A-ha. So you do know of it.

61
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:34,750
Well, yes, I've heard of
the term, but only vaguely.

62
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:36,583
At one point,
the Ministry of Economy

63
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:38,250
proposed a new support system.

64
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:41,500
It was meant to replace Sibyl
but it generated controversy.

65
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:43,791
They had chosen to
call this system Panopticon

66
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:45,625
and it would've controlled
everything from traffic

67
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:48,333
to the banks and kept a
vigilant watch over all of it.

68
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:50,833
A Panopticon.
That's a building that allows

69
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:52,916
[SAIGA] one person to
watch everyone inside

70
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,625
from a single vantage point.

71
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:57,708
It comes from a prison
designed by Jeremy Bentham.

72
00:04:57,791 --> 00:04:59,708
[KAMUI] By observing and
recording people's actions

73
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:01,916
and economic activity,
it could prevent crimes

74
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,833
before they even
happened and guide people

75
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:06,166
towards making
optimal life choices.

76
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:08,666
It's a relatively simple
idea, but some would say

77
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,250
that's what makes it ideal.

78
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:13,666
Hm. Ideal, huh? To the
citizens whose every move

79
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:16,250
is being monitored that
would turn life into a prison.

80
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:19,000
[KAMUI] Which is different
from our current society how?

81
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:21,541
Let's stay on topic.

82
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:23,250
They started out doing
test deployments

83
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:25,416
of Panopticon
for traffic surveillance.

84
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,000
But as you may be
aware, they suddenly

85
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:30,375
[KAMUI] began running into
all kinds of glitches with it.

86
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:32,708
Yeah, and because of
all those complications,

87
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:35,083
the whole Panopticon
project was abandoned.

88
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:37,625
Right. And thus,
Sibyl's rule over society

89
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:39,916
has continued, unabated,
up through today.

90
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,041
But, what if
that's exactly what

91
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:43,666
someone wanted to happen?

92
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:47,000
[KAMUI] What if everything was
arranged to ensure that outcome?

93
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:49,000
That was a widespread
conspiracy theory

94
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:50,375
floating around at the time.

95
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:52,833
[KAMUI] Conspiracy theory?
You're kidding me.

96
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:54,750
Interference with
the Ministry of Economy,

97
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:57,416
manipulation of
resources, scrambling for

98
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,208
a budget, politicians
horse-trading.

99
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:02,750
There's no denying that
those things happened.

100
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:05,166
In fact, as a direct
result of all that--

101
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,750
The number of plane crashes
and traffic accidents

102
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:10,250
that were occurring, was
dozens of times higher

103
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:12,041
than in an average year.

104
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:16,583
There were a lot of casualties
throughout that period.

105
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:19,750
People would later refer
to it as the Season of Hell.

106
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:22,541
[SAIGA] So you found some
kind of answer in that mess?

107
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:24,958
I learned everything,
and I quickly realized

108
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:26,583
what I needed to do next.

109
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:29,666
So I became a
present-day medicine man.

110
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,625
It was roughly five years ago.

111
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:34,375
That's when I was
reunited with him.

112
00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:36,333
[MASUZAKI] I had
become dependent on drugs

113
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:38,208
due to excessive stress.

114
00:06:38,291 --> 00:06:41,458
The cause was plain to see.
My mind could no longer

115
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:44,666
bear the heavy burden that
comes with being a doctor.

116
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:47,250
It happens more often
than you might think.

117
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:51,875
[MASUZAKI]
Kamui managed to heal me.

118
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:53,875
He had somehow
obtained medical data

119
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:55,916
we weren't authorized to see,

120
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,041
and developed techniques to
clear a person's Psycho-Pass,

121
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:01,000
combining intense
meditation with

122
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:03,375
custom-tailored
pharmaceuticals.

123
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:05,208
[SAIGA] The skills
to make any criminal's

124
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:07,250
Psycho-Pass clear, huh?

125
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:10,583
Sounds like a way for him
to avenge his traumatic past.

126
00:07:10,666 --> 00:07:13,000
[MASUZAKI] It won't
be as simple as revenge.

127
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:16,041
Kamui will overturn
everything for us.

128
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:18,000
He's someone who
enables us to dream

129
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:20,500
on a scale we never
thought possible.

130
00:07:20,583 --> 00:07:22,416
Overturn everything we know.

131
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,750
Sounds like one
heck of an end game.

132
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:28,041
[KASEI] I see. So that's
what this is about.

133
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:30,958
It's not just me
you want to judge.

134
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:33,291
You're after the
entire Sibyl System itself.

135
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,416
Do I have that right, Kirito?

136
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,291
[MIKA] Pieces from nearly
two hundred corpses,

137
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:40,875
stitched up into one person.
It's like a horror story.

138
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:42,458
[gasps]

139
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:45,666
[MIKA] It says the file was last
accessed only two months ago.

140
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:50,333
[MIKA] Who's this?

141
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:58,166
[MIKA] Ah, you're
one of Kamui's Holos.

142
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:01,041
So that would
mean Kamui was here?

143
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:04,416
[AKANE] Where's
Inspector Shimotsuki?

144
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,083
She contacted me
and said she was still

145
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:08,416
out in the field,
checking medical records.

146
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,333
[AKANE] Okay. Well,
we shouldn't waste time.

147
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:12,083
Let's give our
latest status reports

148
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:14,125
and make sure we're
all on the same page.

149
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:16,458
Right, I can go first.

150
00:08:16,541 --> 00:08:18,375
I did a search for anyone
who shares the same name

151
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:20,291
with a victim
from the plane crash.

152
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:21,625
[KUNIZUKA] There
are fifty-four matches

153
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:23,166
just in the central city.

154
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,416
[AKANE] There's always
the possibility that--

155
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,750
No. I think we have to

Due to the alarm at your home,

335
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:30,833
[MIKA] This all
began with a plane

336
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:32,541
that crashed fifteen years ago.

337
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:34,666
It was a tragic accident
that claimed the lives of

338
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,041
two hundred and one people,

339
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:38,458
including a hundred and
eighty-four children.

340
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,416
[MIKA] But one party gained
a great deal taking advantage

341
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,541
of the tragedy.
The Togane Foundation.

342
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:47,208
When the dust settled,
the only one who

343
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:50,041
survived the accident
was Kirito Kamui.

344
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:52,166
Misako Togane,
the woman who was running

345
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:54,583
the foundation at the time,
devoted her research

346
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:57,125
to an idiosyncrasy
called "Double A."

347
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:59,666
As part of her study,
an experiment was conducted

348
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,708
to demonstrate a procedure that
the Foundation had patented,

349
00:16:02,791 --> 00:16:04,708
in which they
extracted people's brains

350
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:06,875
and fused them together.

351
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:09,375
She propelled her research
forward using Kamui,

352
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:12,291
as well as the deceased
plane crash victims' bodies.

353
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:14,416
As a result, the
Foundation's proprietary

354
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:17,041
technology continued to evolve.

355
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:21,000
[MIKA] Kirito Kamui's goal
in his crimes is to retaliate

356
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:23,041
against the Togane Foundation.

357
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:24,916
We can hasten his
arrest by maintaining

358
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,125
a close watch
on the Foundation.

359
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:29,500
However, Division
One's ability to function

360
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:32,208
is currently hampered
by problematic elements.

361
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:36,208
Namely, Akane Tsunemori
and Sakuya Togane.

362
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:38,166
Sakuya Togane was
born out of his mother

363
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:40,166
Misako Togane's
experiments to create

364
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,500
the Double A phenomenon,
artificially.

365
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:44,750
We can speculate that
his laboratory beginnings

366
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:46,750
are what allowed for
him to carry the worst

367
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:48,875
Crime Coefficient on record.

368
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:50,791
What all this means
then, is that Kamui,

369
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:53,500
the ringleader of the
crime, and Sakuya Togane,

370
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:56,208
are connected by the
key word "Double A."

371
00:16:56,291 --> 00:16:58,208
Kamui and Togane
differ in their methods,

372
00:16:58,291 --> 00:17:00,583
but they're equally
dangerous in their outcomes.

373
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:02,416
The latter is a deviant
who derives pleasure

374
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,916
from raising other
people's Crime Coefficients.

375
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,625
In fact, records
indicate that each of

376
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:08,500
the five previous
Inspectors with whom

377
00:17:08,583 --> 00:17:11,208
he worked eventually
became latent criminals.

378
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:13,583
I anticipate that with
Sakuya Togane's influence,

379
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:16,375
Inspector Tsunemori's Crime
Coefficient will follow suit,

380
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:17,958
and increase as well.

381
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:20,916
However, Inspector Tsunemori,
does not seem to care.

382
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,791
Nor is she listening
to the advice of others.

383
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:26,125
[MIKA] This is a
serious situation.

384
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:28,458
Many Inspectors and
Enforcers have already died

385
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:30,125
or suffered injury
as a result of

386
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:32,750
Inspector Tsunemori's
bad decision-making.

387
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:34,833
As it stands,
we can't arrest Togane,

388
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:36,666
nor can we stop Kamui.

389

The MWPSB faces
an existential risk.

390
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:42,166
Therefore, I strongly
call for the immediate

391
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:45,041
dismissal of Akane Tsunemori,
or no less the suspension
