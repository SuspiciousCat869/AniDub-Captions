According to Kuwashima,

317
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,500
the person who
leaked the location of

318
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:04,541
Inspector Tsunemori's
grandmother

319
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:06,541
was Enforcer Sakuya Togane.

320
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:08,791
But unfortunately, we'll
probably never find out

321
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:13,166
how he got it, now
that Sakuya's on a slab.

322
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:15,833
That's too bad.

323
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:20,041
Whoever helped him,
I'll never forgive them.

324
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:21,500
[MIKA] Hm.

325
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:24,375
[MIKA] Me neither.

326
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:28,208
[KASEI] As the result of recent
events, we have a number

327
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:30,458
of vacancies to
fill within the system.

328
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:34,791
In fact, some of us have
suggested that we bring you in.

329
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:37,000
If your desire is change
there's no better way to

330
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:39,750
effect it than from the inside.

331
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:41,166
You don't really want that,

332
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:44,833
so are you trying to
provoke me? Is that it?

333
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:46,125
[KASEI] I suppose
that means you're

334
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:47,916
turning down the proposal?

335
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,416
For now, yes.
But when the time comes

336
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:53,458
that you're truly ready to
rid the world of yourselves,

337
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:55,916
I'll be right there
to help you do it.

338
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,250
[KASEI]
A collective Psycho-Pass.

339
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:00,583
In the not-so-distant
future, there will be a

340
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:03,958
society where group
evaluations are the norm.

341
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:06,291
Even if each
individual is clear,

342
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:09,458
it's conceivable that
collectively, they won't be.

343
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:12,750
The fear and doubt this will
cause could lead to chaos.

344
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:14,250
There may be
witch-hunts the likes

345
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:16,000
of which we've never seen.

346
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:17,583
And as a result,

347
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:19,750
we would begin to see
judgments quickly dissolve

348
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:22,333
into brutal massacres; anarchy.

349
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:26,708
And the one who made
it all possible is you.

350
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:29,166
[AKANE] I'm not as
pessimistic as you are.

351
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:32,375
I think this will lead to
more righteous law and order,

352
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:34,750
and greater peace and freedom.

353
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:38,625
Your trademark foolish optimism.

354
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:43,208
[AKANE] Maybe I'm being naïve,
but we won't know unless we try.

355
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:46,500
It's not society that
determines people's futures.

356
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:49,250
It's people who
determine society's future.

357
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:52,333
That's it.
That's what I believe.

358
00:22:26,208 --> 00:22:28,458

359
