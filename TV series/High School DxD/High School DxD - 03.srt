1
00:00:15,533 --> 00:00:17,300
That's what I'm
talking about...!

2
00:00:17,333 --> 00:00:18,633
Smoking hot chick!

3
00:00:18,666 --> 00:00:20,466
Smoking hot panty shot.

4
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:23,400
Or I could act
like a gentleman...

5
00:00:23,433 --> 00:00:23,900
Hey, there.

6
00:00:23,933 --> 00:00:25,200
Are you all right?

7
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:26,133
Oh...

8
00:00:26,166 --> 00:00:28,066
Yeah, I'm okay, really.

9
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,100
Erection.

10
00:00:37,133 --> 00:00:38,266
Uh...

11
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:40,200
Thanks.

12
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:41,666
Sorry about that!

13
00:00:43,833 --> 00:00:45,800
Uh-oh.

14
00:00:45,833 --> 00:00:48,400
Jackpot, this girl
is totally my type.

15
00:00:48,433 --> 00:00:52,100
Blonde and busty, gets me lusty!

16
00:00:52,133 --> 00:00:53,566
That was very sweet of you.

17
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,300
Please... It was nothing.

18
00:00:56,333 --> 00:00:58,233
I've gotta keep this
conversation going...

19
00:00:58,266 --> 00:01:00,300
Let's see, now what
can I talk about?

20
00:01:00,333 --> 00:01:01,333
Hey, whaddaya say...

21
00:01:01,366 --> 00:01:04,033
The weather sure is
nice out here, am I right?

22
00:01:04,066 --> 00:01:05,600
I just sounded like
my grandmother!

23
00:01:05,633 --> 00:01:08,300
Umm... I'm sorry but--

24
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:09,466
I'm a little bit lost,

25
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,500
do you think you
could help me out?

26
00:02:45,724 --> 00:02:47,357
So... Are you a tourist?

27
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:48,890
Oh no, not at all...

28
00:02:48,924 --> 00:02:49,990
As a matter of fact,

29
00:02:50,024 --> 00:02:52,457
I was just assigned to serve
the Church in this town.

30
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:53,890
Right, you're a nun, then...

31
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:55,557
Guess that explains
your uniform.

32
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:58,390
I'm so glad I ran into
someone kind like you...

33
00:02:58,424 --> 00:03:00,690
I guess someone is
looking out for me, huh?

34
00:03:00,724 --> 00:03:03,224
Yeah.

35
00:03:06,824 --> 00:03:09,157
Is everything okay?

36
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:09,824
Oh, yeah...

37
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:11,324
It's all good.

38
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:12,690
What in the heck was that?

39
00:03:16,524 --> 00:03:17,857
Hey, wait a minute!

40
00:03:19,924 --> 00:03:21,890
A big boy like you
shouldn't cry over a scrape.

41
00:03:21,924 --> 00:03:24,557
Don't worry,
you're gonna be fine.

42
00:03:29,957 --> 00:03:30,724
Whoa...

43
00:03:30,757 --> 00:03:32,657
She healed him.

44
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:39,324
Dude. Freakin' weird...

45
00:03:39,357 --> 00:03:41,257
My left hand just wigged out.

46
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:42,190
Ya see...?

47
00:03:42,224 --> 00:03:44,157
There's no reason
for you to cry at all...

48
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,857
You're just fine.

49
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:48,357
All done now.

50
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:55,190
Sorry!

51
00:03:55,224 --> 00:03:57,257
I wonder what's going
on with my body...

52
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:59,257
It's gotta mean something...

53
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:00,557
You must be surprised.

54
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:01,424
Uh, no!

55
00:04:01,457 --> 00:04:02,657
No, not at all...

56
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:05,590
That sure is a pretty nifty
power you've got there though.

57
00:04:05,624 --> 00:04:07,657
Thank you; I consider
it to be a gift

58
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:10,190
and a blessing.

59
00:04:10,224 --> 00:04:12,157
Truly...

60
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:13,857
It's wonderful.

61
00:04:15,557 --> 00:04:17,624
Hey, there it is!

62
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:19,824
Oh, yeah... That's
the Church all right...

63
00:04:19,857 --> 00:04:21,557
The only one we have.

64
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:23,657
Thank goodness I found it...

65
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:25,557
That's a relief.

66
00:04:27,624 --> 00:04:28,757
You know, it's weird...

67
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:30,557
I've never seen
anyone up there...

68
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:31,890
Not a single person.

69
00:04:31,924 --> 00:04:33,724
Let me thank you properly...

70
00:04:33,757 --> 00:04:36,357
Would it be a problem for
you to come inside with me?

71
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:37,190
I can't.

72
00:04:37,224 --> 00:04:39,490
The thing is, I have
somewhere to be.

73
00:04:39,524 --> 00:04:41,390
Oh that's okay...

74
00:04:41,424 --> 00:04:42,757
Guess I should go too...

75
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:44,924
It was sweet of you to
help me find my way...

76
00:04:44,957 --> 00:04:46,890
My name's Asia Argento.

77
00:04:46,924 --> 00:04:48,824
And my name's Issei Hyodo...

78
00:04:48,857 --> 00:04:50,624
You are very welcome.

79
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:51,890
Issei, huh?

80
00:04:51,924 --> 00:04:53,524
Well uh... so...

81
00:04:53,557 --> 00:04:55,457
Meeting you here
was a blessing...

82
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:57,790
And I know for sure,
it's one I won't forget...

83
00:04:57,824 --> 00:04:59,824
I hope we see each other again.

84
00:04:59,857 --> 00:05:01,624
Yeah... Me too.

85
00:05:02,457 --> 00:05:04,490
If you're ever bored or
in the neighborhood...

86
00:05:04,524 --> 00:05:06,757
Come by and visit
me at the Church...

87
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:08,590
That's where I'll be.

88
00:05:08,624 --> 00:05:09,857
Sounds awesome...

89
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:11,624
I'll see you soon...

90
00:05:11,657 --> 00:05:12,890
Have a good one.

91
00:05:12,924 --> 00:05:13,857
Thanks...

92
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:16,524
You have a good one, too!

93
00:05:16,557 --> 00:05:18,824
I think she's the
nicest girl I've ever met.

94
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:23,624
You must never go near
the Church again, Issei.

95
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:24,724
Why?

96
00:05:24,757 --> 00:05:27,757
For Devils like us, the
Church is enemy territory...

97
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:30,424
Simply setting foot inside
would create major problems

98
00:05:30,457 --> 00:05:32,490
for both angels and devils...

99
00:05:32,524 --> 00:05:33,490
Surely you could sense

100
00:05:33,524 --> 00:05:35,824
that something was
telling you to be careful.

101
00:05:35,857 --> 00:05:37,524
Oh... That's what it was...

102
00:05:37,557 --> 00:05:39,424
When I went near the
church I thought I felt a chill,

103
00:05:39,457 --> 00:05:41,390
and my left hand tensed up.

104
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:45,224
That was your devil instinct
telling you danger was near.

105
00:05:45,257 --> 00:05:47,590
Being in close
proximity to someone

106
00:05:47,624 --> 00:05:49,790
from the Church is a
very risky proposition...

107
00:05:49,824 --> 00:05:50,990
Also...

108
00:05:51,024 --> 00:05:53,524
What's even more dangerous is
that some of the exorcists

109
00:05:53,557 --> 00:05:56,490
affiliated with the
Church use Sacred Gears.

110
00:05:56,524 --> 00:05:58,590
They could really hurt you.

111
00:06:00,257 --> 00:06:00,890
Issei?

112
00:06:00,924 --> 00:06:02,724
Yeah, I'm listening.

113
00:06:02,757 --> 00:06:04,890
Just know that if a devil
receives a devil-purge

114
00:06:04,924 --> 00:06:07,157
it's utterly annihilated...

115
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:07,924
Nil...

116
00:06:07,957 --> 00:06:09,424
The end of the line...

117
00:06:09,457 --> 00:06:12,490
They can feel nothing...
They're gone forever.

118
00:06:12,524 --> 00:06:14,857
You can never come
back from that...

119
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:17,357
Do you understand?

120
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:19,290
I got it.

121
00:06:19,324 --> 00:06:20,557
I'm sorry...

122
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:22,390
I've gotten too worked up...

123
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:25,524
I want you to be
more careful, that's all.

124
00:06:25,957 --> 00:06:27,590
Of course.

125
00:06:28,957 --> 00:06:29,824
Well great...

126
00:06:29,857 --> 00:06:30,957
I guess I've gone
and done it again...

127
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:35,224
Seems like she's always
pissed off at me for something.

128
00:06:35,824 --> 00:06:37,657
Sorry, Asia...

129
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:40,390
Looks like I'm not gonna
be able to keep my promise.

130
00:06:40,424 --> 00:06:41,624
She's not pissed off you know;

131
00:06:41,657 --> 00:06:44,357
she's just worried
about you, silly boy.

132
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:46,124
You scared me!

133
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:48,690
You're still here...

134
00:06:48,724 --> 00:06:50,590
I thought you had
gone home for the day.

135
00:06:50,624 --> 00:06:52,724
We just received a
message from the archduke.

136
00:06:52,757 --> 00:06:54,357
The archduke?

137
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:55,590
It was urgent...

138
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:58,490
A stray devil has been
causing trouble nearby.

139
00:07:00,357 --> 00:07:02,790
Stray devils start out
as devil's servants.

140
00:07:02,824 --> 00:07:04,457
You mean like we are?

141
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:06,190
No, not exactly...

142
00:07:06,224 --> 00:07:07,390
Once in a while,

143
00:07:07,424 --> 00:07:10,390
a servant rebels and kills
their master to gain freedom.

144
00:07:10,424 --> 00:07:11,924
Then they become strays.

145
00:07:11,957 --> 00:07:13,390
According to the reports,

146
00:07:13,424 --> 00:07:14,857
this stray has
been tricking people

147
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:17,524
into that abandoned
house and eating them.

148
00:07:17,557 --> 00:07:18,390
Gross!

149
00:07:18,424 --> 00:07:19,790
Tonight's job
shouldn't be too hard;

150
00:07:19,824 --> 00:07:21,657
just find the beast and kill it.

151
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:23,557
These monsters are pure evil.

152
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:26,457
They don't care about anything
but their own selfish desires.

153
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:29,790
And that always
ends in ugliness.

154
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:30,357
Issei?

155
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:32,290
Uh... Yes, President?

156
00:07:32,324 --> 00:07:34,524
Are you familiar with the game
of chess?

157
00:07:34,557 --> 00:07:35,857
Yeah, sort of...

158
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:38,690
I've played it,
but I totally suck.

159
00:07:38,724 --> 00:07:40,890
As the master, I'm the King...

160
00:07:40,924 --> 00:07:42,624
My empress is the Queen...

161
00:07:42,657 --> 00:07:43,924
My cavalier the knight...

162
00:07:43,957 --> 00:07:45,890
My tank, the rook...

163
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:47,590
My clergyman, the bishop...

164
00:07:47,624 --> 00:07:50,457
And my foot soldier, the pawn.

165
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:53,157
Devils with titles of nobility
grant the characteristics

166
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:55,824
of these pieces to each
one of their servants.

167
00:07:55,857 --> 00:07:57,357
That sounds kick A.

168
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:59,357
We have a special
name for them...

169
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:01,357
We call them our 'evil pieces.'

170
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:03,524
Sorry, but why are
you telling me this?

171
00:08:03,557 --> 00:08:05,457
I want you to watch and learn...

172
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:08,357
Pay close attention to my devils
as they do battle here tonight.

173
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:09,790
Oh. Okay.

174
00:08:09,824 --> 00:08:11,624
It's here.

175
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:14,857
Now what could that
foul, fecal smell be?

176
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:18,457
Mmmm, and something smells
quite delicious as well...!

177
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:20,590
I wonder if it tastes sweet...

178
00:08:20,624 --> 00:08:22,690
Or bitter!

179
00:08:22,724 --> 00:08:24,924
I see big boobies!

180
00:08:24,957 --> 00:08:26,490
Viser, you wretch...

181
00:08:26,524 --> 00:08:28,524
You betrayed your
master and ran away

182
00:08:28,557 --> 00:08:31,790
to fulfill the lustful wants and
desires that have consumed you.

183
00:08:31,824 --> 00:08:34,224
Your sins are worthy
of a thousand hells.

184
00:08:34,257 --> 00:08:36,590
In the name of the great
Marquis of Gremory...

185
00:08:36,624 --> 00:08:37,590
Be gone...

186
00:08:37,624 --> 00:08:39,157
Or meet your death!

187
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:41,524
Oh, just give it a rest,
you little slut...!

188
00:08:41,557 --> 00:08:43,624
You always have
had it in for me...!

189
00:08:43,657 --> 00:08:45,457
You're just jealous
cause your breasts

190
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:47,557
will never be as
luscious as these!

191
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:50,857
This is your final warning:
Go back to your master now!

192
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:51,490
Whoa...

193
00:08:51,524 --> 00:08:53,690
This is a stray devil...?

194
00:08:53,724 --> 00:08:56,624
She looks like a soft-core
late-night cable-star!

195
00:08:56,657 --> 00:08:59,590
Let me show you
what I'm made of then!

196
00:08:59,624 --> 00:09:00,657
Ya see what I mean?

197
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:04,524
When I said it ends in
ugliness, I wasn't joking.

198
00:09:04,557 --> 00:09:06,590
She's got a really
nice rack though...

199
00:09:06,624 --> 00:09:07,724
What a waste.

200
00:09:09,857 --> 00:09:11,157
Uh-oh...

201
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:12,524
This is not good!

202
00:09:22,724 --> 00:09:24,790
This is a porno
I don't wanna be in!

203
00:09:24,824 --> 00:09:26,390
Please be careful...

204
00:09:26,424 --> 00:09:27,824
Kiba!

205
00:09:27,857 --> 00:09:29,190
He just vanished!

206
00:09:29,224 --> 00:09:32,224
No, he didn't;
he's just moving fast.

207
00:09:32,257 --> 00:09:33,790
In this game, he's my knight.

208
00:09:33,824 --> 00:09:35,790
His attribute is speed...

209
00:09:35,824 --> 00:09:38,757
And his ultimate attack
weapon is his sword.

210
00:09:43,957 --> 00:09:45,890
Koneko...! Watch out!

211
00:09:55,457 --> 00:09:57,224
It's all right.

212
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:05,490
In the game, she's my rook...

213
00:10:05,524 --> 00:10:06,924
Her attribute is simple...

214
00:10:06,957 --> 00:10:09,257
She has an
unparalleled strength.

215
00:10:09,857 --> 00:10:12,257
That won't even
put a dent in her.

216
00:10:12,657 --> 00:10:15,157
See you on the flip side.

217
00:10:21,657 --> 00:10:22,790
Mental note to self...

218
00:10:22,824 --> 00:10:24,790
Do not piss her off.

219
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:25,757
Akeno?

220
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:27,157
Oh, is it my turn?

221
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:28,390
How exciting...

222
00:10:28,424 --> 00:10:30,657
I so love this game.

223
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:35,657
Look out!

224
00:10:36,324 --> 00:10:38,357
Sacred Gear!

225
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:46,190
Thanks for that, Issei.

226
00:10:46,224 --> 00:10:47,190
Hey, no problem...

227
00:10:47,224 --> 00:10:49,290
My body did that on its own.

228
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:54,157
Akeno...

229
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:55,624
Finish her off please.

230
00:10:55,657 --> 00:10:56,824
I've got news for you:

231
00:10:56,857 --> 00:10:59,357
You're not the only one who
likes to play rough here...

232
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:02,424
So, let's you and
I have some fun!

233
00:11:02,457 --> 00:11:04,657
Akeno is my Queen.

234
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:08,624
Her attributes are a perfect
combo of all the other pieces.

235
00:11:08,657 --> 00:11:09,924
She's simply unbeatable.

236
00:11:09,957 --> 00:11:10,857
Tough girl...

237
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:12,724
Not ready to give up yet...?

238
00:11:12,757 --> 00:11:13,790
Goody!

239
00:11:13,824 --> 00:11:16,157
I get to play some more!

240
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:18,490
Her weapon is a
dark, magical power...

241
00:11:18,524 --> 00:11:19,490
And that's not all.

242
00:11:19,524 --> 00:11:20,624
This violence...

243
00:11:20,657 --> 00:11:23,390
It's making me so hot.

244
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:25,657
She's really into S and M.

245
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:29,190
Is this as good for
you as it is for me?!!!

246
00:11:29,224 --> 00:11:30,790
You mean she gets off on this?

247
00:11:30,824 --> 00:11:31,690
Akeno...

248
00:11:31,724 --> 00:11:34,724
I think she's had enough.

249
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:37,857
Aww, over already...?

250
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:40,290
I was just starting
to enjoy myself.

251
00:11:45,624 --> 00:11:48,524
Any last words
before we finish this?

252
00:11:48,557 --> 00:11:50,357
Go to hell.

253
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:51,657
All right...

254
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:54,624
How about we get
it over with then?

255
00:11:54,657 --> 00:11:56,557
Game over.

256
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:06,757
We're done here...

257
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:08,790
Come on.

258
00:12:08,824 --> 00:12:10,390
Let's go home.

259
00:12:10,424 --> 00:12:11,590
Sounds good to me.

260
00:12:11,624 --> 00:12:13,257
But...

261
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:14,424
Wait a second.

262
00:12:14,457 --> 00:12:15,424
What's wrong?

263
00:12:15,457 --> 00:12:16,424
What am I...?

264
00:12:16,457 --> 00:12:17,757
What chess piece...?

265
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:19,690
I'd just like to
know how I fit in...

266
00:12:19,724 --> 00:12:22,624
Tell me: Am I a knight or
something bad ass like that?

267
00:12:22,657 --> 00:12:24,290
You're a pawn.

268
00:12:24,324 --> 00:12:25,690
But I don't wanna be a pawn.

269
00:12:25,724 --> 00:12:26,690
Well...

270
00:12:26,724 --> 00:12:27,424
I'm sorry...

271
00:12:27,457 --> 00:12:29,724
It's what you are.

272
00:12:29,757 --> 00:12:31,224
But that blows.

273
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:35,324
Chicks do not dig pawns!

274
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:52,192
If I wanna have
my own servants...

275
00:12:52,225 --> 00:12:54,825
First, I have to become
a high-ranking devil.

276
00:12:54,859 --> 00:12:57,959
If I was born into power
like Rias, it'd be easy.

277
00:12:57,992 --> 00:12:59,192
But I'm just another
stupid reborn,

278
00:12:59,225 --> 00:13:01,959
so I have to bust my ass
to prove myself...

279
00:13:01,992 --> 00:13:03,592
How can I do that though...?

280
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:04,425
I'm a pawn...

281
00:13:04,459 --> 00:13:06,792
The punk-ass
little bitch of chess.

282
00:13:08,092 --> 00:13:10,825
At this rate, I'll be a
full-blown loser forever.

283
00:13:18,292 --> 00:13:20,925
It's unlocked.
That doesn't seem very safe.

284
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:21,859
Hello...!

285
00:13:21,892 --> 00:13:24,159
I'm the devil sent
here by Lady Gremory...!

286
00:13:24,192 --> 00:13:25,792
Is anybody home?!

287
00:13:27,792 --> 00:13:28,592
Uh-oh...

288
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:30,459
I just had that
weird feeling again.

289
00:13:31,659 --> 00:13:34,859
If you're home,
please say something!

290
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:40,692
Koneko's over-loaded with
summon requests this evening...

291
00:13:40,725 --> 00:13:43,259
Can I ask you to handle
one of them for her?

292
00:13:43,292 --> 00:13:44,925
Yeah, for sure.

293
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:45,959
Good.

294
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:48,125
Just make sure you
bring back a pact this time.

295
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:51,792
Whatever you do,
please don't disappoint me.

296
00:13:51,825 --> 00:13:54,592
Yes, of course.

297
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:55,825
If I turn back now...

298
00:13:55,859 --> 00:13:58,925
There's no way in hell I'll
be able to face the president.

299
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:06,225
Don't be totally freaked
out, but I'm coming inside!

300
00:14:09,025 --> 00:14:10,959
Nice of them to set the mood...

301
00:14:10,992 --> 00:14:13,125
Can anyone hear me?

302
00:14:14,292 --> 00:14:19,192
Floor's wet.

303
00:14:19,225 --> 00:14:22,225
Is this blood?

304
00:14:29,059 --> 00:14:30,692
Holy shit!

305
00:14:30,725 --> 00:14:34,159
'Punish the wicked.'
Words to live by.

306
00:14:34,192 --> 00:14:34,992
Yes...

307
00:14:35,025 --> 00:14:38,559
Wise advice to heed
from a holy man.

308
00:14:42,992 --> 00:14:44,492
Well, well.

309
00:14:44,525 --> 00:14:47,992
You just walked into the wrong
house, my friend...

310
00:14:48,025 --> 00:14:50,659
Freed Sellzen here,
at your service.

311
00:14:50,692 --> 00:14:52,625
And you must be
the scared little pussy

312
00:14:52,659 --> 00:14:55,892
who's devil ass this holy
priest is gonna exorcise!

313
00:14:55,925 --> 00:14:57,525
A priest?!

314
00:14:57,559 --> 00:14:58,559
Yep...

315
00:14:58,592 --> 00:15:00,725
I work for a certain
devil-purging organization

316
00:15:00,759 --> 00:15:01,959
you may have heard of.

317
00:15:01,992 --> 00:15:03,759
So you're the
one who did this?!

318
00:15:03,792 --> 00:15:04,892
Huh?

319
00:15:04,925 --> 00:15:07,059
Summoning you was proof
that he's done being human...

320
00:15:07,092 --> 00:15:09,259
End of the line, sinner!

321
00:15:09,292 --> 00:15:12,525
So I had to chop him up
into little bitty pieces!

322
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:13,759
Putting down degenerate devils,

323
00:15:13,792 --> 00:15:16,925
and the lost souls that would
cry out to them is my job...

324
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:19,725
And no one is
better at it than me!

325
00:15:20,659 --> 00:15:21,892
That's a sword of light!

326
00:15:21,925 --> 00:15:23,792
First I'm gonna cut
out your evil heart,

327
00:15:23,825 --> 00:15:25,792
with my heavenly
blade of light...

328
00:15:25,825 --> 00:15:26,892
Then with my righteous gun,

329
00:15:26,925 --> 00:15:29,725
I'm going to blow a hole
in your wicked demon face...

330
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:31,759
How does that sound, devil?!

331
00:15:33,725 --> 00:15:35,759
Kerblam!

332
00:15:38,259 --> 00:15:40,892
These bullets have been
blessed by an exorcist...

333
00:15:40,925 --> 00:15:43,192
Hope they taste good, scumbag?!

334
00:15:44,225 --> 00:15:45,725
Damn you!

335
00:15:46,859 --> 00:15:49,025
Ooo... Is the devil angry?

336
00:15:49,059 --> 00:15:50,825
Maybe it's time for
Freed Sellzen to send you

337
00:15:50,859 --> 00:15:53,159
back to the abyss
from whence you came!

338
00:15:54,825 --> 00:15:56,092
Too slow.

339
00:15:57,925 --> 00:16:00,659
Get a guy all worked up and
leave him half cocked...?

340
00:16:00,692 --> 00:16:03,925
That's no way for a lady to
treat a gentleman like myself!

341
00:16:07,859 --> 00:16:08,859
What the hell...?

342
00:16:08,892 --> 00:16:10,892
Asia, what are you doing here?

343
00:16:10,925 --> 00:16:13,959
Are you done creating
the barrier already?

344
00:16:13,992 --> 00:16:15,792
Don't... Don't do this.

345
00:16:15,825 --> 00:16:17,092
Right, a newbie...!

346
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:19,192
Well then, I guess
it's time you learned!

347
00:16:19,225 --> 00:16:21,192
This is what the
job is, my dear...

348
00:16:21,225 --> 00:16:22,959
We dispose of unfortunate people

349
00:16:22,992 --> 00:16:25,925
who have been bewitched
by the evil devils.

350
00:16:28,292 --> 00:16:30,559
No. It can't be.

351
00:16:30,592 --> 00:16:31,892
Asia, I--

352
00:16:31,925 --> 00:16:34,492
What's going on...?
Do you two know each other?

353
00:16:34,525 --> 00:16:36,592
Issei, why are you here?

354
00:16:38,225 --> 00:16:42,859
I'm here... because...
I'm a devil, Asia.

355
00:16:42,892 --> 00:16:45,825
No... That can't be true.

356
00:16:45,859 --> 00:16:47,692
I didn't want to lie to you...

357
00:16:47,725 --> 00:16:49,159
I swear that I didn't...

358
00:16:49,192 --> 00:16:52,625
That's why I decided it was
best not to see you again...

359
00:16:52,659 --> 00:16:53,959
Please forgive me.

360
00:16:53,992 --> 00:16:54,792
Oh, heavens.

361
00:16:54,825 --> 00:16:57,125
Not that this isn't
heart-warming...

362
00:16:57,159 --> 00:17:00,792
But you and your friend here
have no business being together.

363
00:17:00,825 --> 00:17:02,659
The Fallen Angels
have expressly forbidden

364
00:17:02,692 --> 00:17:05,192
all forms of contact
between our kind and theirs...

365
00:17:05,225 --> 00:17:07,225
Have you forgotten that already?

366
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:08,459
Fallen angels?

367
00:17:08,492 --> 00:17:12,125
Now then, shall we go ahead
and do what we came here to do?!

368
00:17:12,159 --> 00:17:13,559
Not that it matters much...

369
00:17:13,592 --> 00:17:15,925
...but I hope you
said your prayers!

370
00:17:17,925 --> 00:17:19,759
Asia?

371
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:22,725
You've got to be
kidding me with this.

372
00:17:22,759 --> 00:17:24,759
Please don't,
I beg you for mercy ...

373
00:17:24,792 --> 00:17:26,792
Forgive this man
his sins, Father...!

374
00:17:26,825 --> 00:17:28,692
Couldn't we just let him go?

375
00:17:28,725 --> 00:17:30,225
That thing isn't a man.

376
00:17:30,259 --> 00:17:31,159
It's a devil.

377
00:17:31,192 --> 00:17:33,125
You made a pledge
to defeat our enemies!

378
00:17:33,159 --> 00:17:34,925
It doesn't matter
to me what he is...

379
00:17:34,959 --> 00:17:37,059
There's goodness
in him, I know it!

380
00:17:37,092 --> 00:17:38,659
You can't just kill him...

381
00:17:38,692 --> 00:17:42,059
How can you actually believe
the Father would approve?!

382
00:17:43,259 --> 00:17:45,625
Enough of this bullshit!

383
00:17:49,525 --> 00:17:51,692
Don't you touch her!

384
00:17:51,725 --> 00:17:53,592
You've lost your
fucking mind...!

385
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:54,559
What? Are there maggots

386
00:17:54,592 --> 00:17:57,525
growing inside that
stupid head of yours!

387
00:17:58,125 --> 00:17:59,325
Let her go!

388
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:01,692
Our fallen angel friend says
I'm not supposed to hurt you,

389
00:18:01,725 --> 00:18:04,225
but I don't give a
damn about that now...

390
00:18:04,259 --> 00:18:06,925
You know what happens
to naughty girls, don't you?

391
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:11,125
Asia!

392
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:14,825
Why shouldn't an
upstanding priest

393
00:18:14,859 --> 00:18:18,092
do what he wants with
a filthy tramp like you?

394
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:20,059
That's not so wrong, is it?!

395
00:18:20,092 --> 00:18:21,159
Don't hurt me!

396
00:18:21,192 --> 00:18:23,525
Stop it!

397
00:18:26,959 --> 00:18:28,759
Look, boy... you
wanna watch this go down

398
00:18:28,792 --> 00:18:30,092
you're gonna have
to pay for it...

399
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:31,792
Nothing is free!

400
00:18:31,825 --> 00:18:33,625
I'm not kidding around...

401
00:18:33,659 --> 00:18:35,759
Let her go!

402
00:18:35,792 --> 00:18:38,859
Well... Well.

403
00:18:38,892 --> 00:18:40,592
Think you can take me down...?

404
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:42,025
Then come over here and
show me what you got!

405
00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:44,492
No, you don't hafta do this!

406
00:18:44,525 --> 00:18:46,625
There's no way I can win.

407
00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:49,492
If I go through with it,
I'm probably gonna die.

408
00:18:50,225 --> 00:18:53,525
But she put her life on
the line to protect me.

409
00:18:53,559 --> 00:18:54,592
She saved me.

410
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:56,025
I'll save her...!

411
00:18:56,059 --> 00:18:57,559
Bastard!

412
00:18:57,592 --> 00:19:00,225
Take that!

413
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,092
I'll admit, I'm impressed...

414
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:08,992
Whaddaya say we go for a new
world record, devil scum...?!

415
00:19:09,025 --> 00:19:13,459
Let's see how many pieces
of meat I can chop you into!

416
00:19:19,292 --> 00:19:20,859
What was that?!

417
00:19:22,525 --> 00:19:23,525
Kiba!

418
00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:24,225
Hey, Issei...

419
00:19:24,259 --> 00:19:26,725
Thought you could use a hand.

420
00:19:26,759 --> 00:19:28,025
Oh, this is gross...

421
00:19:28,059 --> 00:19:29,992
Talk about a nasty mess.

422
00:19:30,025 --> 00:19:31,692
An exorcist.

423
00:19:31,725 --> 00:19:33,492
You guys came.

424
00:19:33,525 --> 00:19:34,692
Hell yeah...!

425
00:19:34,725 --> 00:19:37,225
Now we've got ourselves a
good ole' fashioned gang bang!

426
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:38,192
You're done here...

427
00:19:38,225 --> 00:19:40,725
Sorry to disappoint
you but he's one of us.

428
00:19:40,759 --> 00:19:43,225
Oh, I'm far from
disappointed, trust me...!

429
00:19:43,259 --> 00:19:43,759
So...

430
00:19:43,792 --> 00:19:44,692
What's the deal...?

431
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:47,159
You're the pitcher
and he's the catcher?

432
00:19:47,192 --> 00:19:49,859
For a priest, that's quite
a mouth you've got there.

433
00:19:49,892 --> 00:19:52,025
What are you,
the impiety police...?

434
00:19:52,059 --> 00:19:53,859
Get off your
high horse douche bag;

435
00:19:53,892 --> 00:19:56,192
hunting your kind
is my only concern!

436
00:19:56,225 --> 00:19:58,125
So stop preaching,
and let's get to it!

437
00:19:58,159 --> 00:20:00,725
My my, this guy certainly
is a piece of work.

438
00:20:00,759 --> 00:20:03,159
And you, my dear,
are a hot piece of ass...!

439
00:20:03,192 --> 00:20:05,525
Oh, those eyes are killing me.

440
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:09,125
There's nothing I lust after
more than a sexy devil bitch!

441
00:20:09,159 --> 00:20:12,059
If you want it,
come and get some!

442
00:20:15,025 --> 00:20:17,225
But I really don't think
you could handle it...

443
00:20:17,259 --> 00:20:19,192
Nobody hurts one of my servants.

444
00:20:19,225 --> 00:20:20,159
President!

445
00:20:20,192 --> 00:20:20,992
Well...

446
00:20:21,025 --> 00:20:22,959
Look who finally
showed their tits...

447
00:20:22,992 --> 00:20:24,259
Don't get ahead
of yourself though,

448
00:20:24,292 --> 00:20:26,225
cause I'm pretty
sure I just hurt him.

449
00:20:26,259 --> 00:20:28,959
It's all right... I'm here.

450
00:20:28,992 --> 00:20:30,125
Thanks a lot...

451
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:32,225
I'm sorry that
I let you down again...

452
00:20:32,259 --> 00:20:34,192
I tried, but I failed you.

453
00:20:34,225 --> 00:20:36,559
Look at how hurt you are, Issei.

454
00:20:37,225 --> 00:20:38,892
I'm the one who's sorry...

455
00:20:38,925 --> 00:20:43,025
I sent you into the hands of
an exorcist, and I had no idea.

456
00:20:43,059 --> 00:20:45,592
There was a barrier in
place here until a moment ago,

457
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:47,625
so we didn't even realize.

458
00:20:47,659 --> 00:20:49,192
You were supposed
to make the barrier...

459
00:20:49,225 --> 00:20:50,859
Little bitch...!

460
00:20:50,892 --> 00:20:52,159
Die!

461
00:20:52,192 --> 00:20:53,892
Please, don't hurt her!

462
00:20:53,925 --> 00:20:54,892
I never forgive people

463
00:20:54,925 --> 00:20:57,025
who try to do harm to
one of my servants...

464
00:20:57,059 --> 00:20:59,625
Nor do I forgive those
who pick on the weak.

465
00:20:59,659 --> 00:21:02,925
And I especially don't tolerate
insidious wretches like you...

466
00:21:02,959 --> 00:21:05,192
Your terrible evil has
no place in this world...

467
00:21:05,225 --> 00:21:07,559
That's why I'm here:
to purge it.

468
00:21:07,592 --> 00:21:08,725
Well shit...

469
00:21:08,759 --> 00:21:10,725
Big red over there
could be a problem...

470
00:21:10,759 --> 00:21:12,859
I may need some back-up.

471
00:21:13,792 --> 00:21:16,159
Fallen angels are here.

472
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:18,692
Just in the nick of time too...!

473
00:21:18,725 --> 00:21:21,692
Hope you're hungry; cause
light spears are on the menu!

474
00:21:21,725 --> 00:21:22,792
So what's the plan?

475
00:21:22,825 --> 00:21:25,259
Right now, we just need
to get Issei out of here...

476
00:21:25,292 --> 00:21:27,125
Akeno, prepare to jump.

477
00:21:27,159 --> 00:21:28,992
Right.

478
00:21:29,025 --> 00:21:30,092
Koneko.

479
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:31,525
Make sure we have Issei.

480
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:32,992
'Kay.

481
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:34,525
You're all screwed now!

482
00:21:44,992 --> 00:21:46,259
We can't leave!

483
00:21:46,292 --> 00:21:48,559
What about Asia?!

484
00:21:48,592 --> 00:21:49,959
I'm afraid only
members of my household

485
00:21:49,992 --> 00:21:52,025
can jump with
this magic circle...

486
00:21:52,059 --> 00:21:53,959
Sorry, but it wouldn't work.

487
00:21:53,992 --> 00:21:55,792
No... Please wait...

488
00:21:55,825 --> 00:21:57,159
Don't do this!

489
00:21:57,192 --> 00:21:58,159
I'm not going
to leave her behind!

490
00:21:58,192 --> 00:22:00,892
You have to put me
down so I can rescue her!

491
00:22:00,925 --> 00:22:02,759
Asia!

492
00:22:02,792 --> 00:22:03,959
Go without me...

493
00:22:03,992 --> 00:22:05,825
Please go.

494
00:22:05,859 --> 00:22:07,192
I'll see you soon.

495
00:22:07,225 --> 00:22:09,759
Trust me. I will.

496
00:22:09,792 --> 00:22:13,525
Asia!

497
00:23:49,044 --> 00:23:50,844
End of the line for you.

498
00:23:50,878 --> 00:23:51,911
I'm little...

499
00:23:51,944 --> 00:23:53,078
But I pack a mean punch...

500
00:23:53,111 --> 00:23:54,278
I promise you.

501
00:23:54,311 --> 00:23:55,244
Thank you...

502
00:23:55,278 --> 00:23:56,978
This is special...

503
00:23:57,011 --> 00:23:59,711
Even if it is only for today.

504
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:02,478
If I can't take care of
my friends, what good am I?!
