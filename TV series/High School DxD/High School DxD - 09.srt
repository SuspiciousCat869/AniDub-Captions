1
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,700
You're almost there!

2
00:00:19,733 --> 00:00:21,600
Just a few more feet!

3
00:00:21,633 --> 00:00:23,533
Visualize, Issei!

4
00:00:23,566 --> 00:00:25,266
Coming!

5
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:26,233
Rias.

6
00:00:26,266 --> 00:00:28,333
Should I go get some
of those bags for him?

7
00:00:28,366 --> 00:00:29,400
He'll be okay...

8
00:00:29,433 --> 00:00:32,233
He needs to learn to
carry that much on his own.

9
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:33,800
On your right!

10
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:34,866
Seriously...?!

11
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:37,766
Did they give you a bag
of feathers or something?

12
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,500
Move it.

13
00:00:42,266 --> 00:00:45,266
I hate this!

14
00:00:47,066 --> 00:00:48,533
Ten days.

15
00:00:48,566 --> 00:00:51,200
I think we can all
agree that's fair.

16
00:00:51,233 --> 00:00:52,266
You sure?

17
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:54,766
Considering your youth
and lack of experience...

18
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,033
And Lord Riser's prowess...

19
00:00:56,066 --> 00:01:00,166
I've decided that assigning a
handicap would be appropriate.

20
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,066
As much as it pains
me to admit it...

21
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,433
I think you may be right.

22
00:01:03,466 --> 00:01:05,433
Extra time to train
would be very useful...

23
00:01:05,466 --> 00:01:07,100
For all of us...

24
00:01:07,133 --> 00:01:09,266
Thanks, I accept the offer.

25
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,600
You ready, Issei?

26
00:01:11,633 --> 00:01:14,800
The purpose of this training
camp is to build your strength.

27
00:01:14,833 --> 00:01:19,033
Soon... you will be stronger
than we ever imagined.

28
00:02:56,734 --> 00:02:57,700
Wow...!

29
00:02:57,734 --> 00:02:59,167
How beautiful!

30
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,267
All right, you guys.

31
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,834
Let's head inside and
get going on this training!

32
00:03:01,867 --> 00:03:03,667
But we just got here!

33
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:06,267
That's evil and nowhere
even close to fair!

34
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,767
Why, thank you!

35
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,167
I have a question.

36
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,034
Y'know when you said ...

37
00:03:22,067 --> 00:03:24,367
that stuff about
hating fallen angels...?

38
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,834
You never really
explained what happened

39
00:03:25,867 --> 00:03:28,634
to make you feel that way,
and I've kinda been wondering.

40
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:31,800
Fallen angels aren't exactly my
favorite things in the world...

41
00:03:31,834 --> 00:03:34,300
The truth is, I hate them.

42
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,200
Are you seriously asking
me about that right now?

43
00:03:37,234 --> 00:03:38,267
It shouldn't matter...

44
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,734
All that matters is
winning this Rating Game...

45
00:03:40,767 --> 00:03:41,934
We need to focus our energy

46
00:03:41,967 --> 00:03:44,700
on the present--not
worry about the past...

47
00:03:44,734 --> 00:03:45,934
'kay?

48
00:03:45,967 --> 00:03:47,300
You're right!
Let's do this!

49
00:03:47,334 --> 00:03:48,667
I am so with you.

50
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:49,834
Lesson One.

51
00:03:49,867 --> 00:03:51,867
Yup. Bring it, blondie bear.

52
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,500
You're a little off.

53
00:03:55,534 --> 00:03:57,500
Don't limit your focus
to just the sword.

54
00:03:57,534 --> 00:03:59,534
Keep an eye on your opponent!

55
00:04:03,267 --> 00:04:04,634
I meant to do that.

56
00:04:04,667 --> 00:04:06,667
Come on, you gotta focus!

57
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,867
Lesson Two, it's time you both

58
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:11,434
became aware of the aura
and magic surrounding you

59
00:04:11,467 --> 00:04:14,300
and tried to stream it
to a focal point.

60
00:04:16,534 --> 00:04:18,367
Let the image of
light flow through you

61
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,700
and be released
as magical power.

62
00:04:20,734 --> 00:04:22,434
I think I did it!

63
00:04:24,867 --> 00:04:25,834
Awesome!

64
00:04:25,867 --> 00:04:27,834
Look at you go with your
little green light...!

65
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:30,834
I think you have a lot of
natural talent for this, Asia!

66
00:04:30,867 --> 00:04:31,967
Well...

67
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,800
She's uh... She's getting
better, that's for sure...

68
00:04:34,834 --> 00:04:36,567
But she's not the only one.

69
00:04:38,667 --> 00:04:40,200
Whoa...! You're quick!

70
00:04:40,234 --> 00:04:41,500
And you will be too.

71
00:04:41,534 --> 00:04:42,767
Once you grasp the technique,

72
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,767
you can control fire,
water, lightning,

73
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,734
and any of the other elements...

74
00:04:46,767 --> 00:04:48,800
Asia, I bet this one
would be easy for you.

75
00:04:48,834 --> 00:04:49,667
Wanna try?

76
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,434
Sure!

77
00:04:51,467 --> 00:04:53,800
You, on the other hand, need
to spend a little more time

78
00:04:53,834 --> 00:04:55,800
on those
concentration exercises.

79
00:04:55,834 --> 00:04:57,567
I know.

80
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,167
Visualization is the
essence of all magic.

81
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,900
Think about whatever
it is you want

82
00:05:01,934 --> 00:05:03,667
and see it happening
in your mind.

83
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:04,700
Kay?

84
00:05:04,734 --> 00:05:06,834
Are there any rules
about what I can imagine?

85
00:05:06,867 --> 00:05:08,600
Not at all.

86
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,600
Anything you want.

87
00:05:10,634 --> 00:05:11,867
Just concentrate.

88
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:12,500
Yeah!

89
00:05:12,534 --> 00:05:14,167
There ya go!

90
00:05:16,967 --> 00:05:17,767
No...!

91
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,600
Please don't be able
to read my mind,

92
00:05:18,634 --> 00:05:19,300
that's not what
I meant to think of!

93
00:05:19,334 --> 00:05:21,667
What's the matter, you okay...?

94
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:22,800
Issei?

95
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,067
I'm fine!

96
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,734
I'm just focused
on magical things!

97
00:05:26,767 --> 00:05:28,667
Lesson Three.

98
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,667
That was lame.

99
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:37,267
I wasn't finished!

100
00:05:37,934 --> 00:05:40,267
You gotta aim more towards
the body's central axis

101
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:43,367
and learn to strike with
precision at your victim's core.

102
00:05:46,867 --> 00:05:47,667
Screw this!

103
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,300
Asia's like the
manifestation queen

104
00:05:49,334 --> 00:05:51,734
and I can't even control
my own imagination...!

105
00:05:51,767 --> 00:05:53,734
Ugh! I suck at life!

106
00:05:53,767 --> 00:05:55,767
We all have powers
that are unique to us.

107
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,334
Yeah, whatever...

108
00:05:57,367 --> 00:05:59,834
Name one thing that I'm
better at than other people.

109
00:05:59,867 --> 00:06:01,300
You're a pervert.

110
00:06:01,334 --> 00:06:02,667
Thanks a lot.

111
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,434
But wait there's more.

112
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,500
You can also be a
really hard worker.

113
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:08,667
Hey, you think so...?

114
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:09,800
That's not so bad.

115
00:06:09,834 --> 00:06:11,467
Thanks, Koneko!

116
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,800
Suck it.

117
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,634
Now, Lesson Four!

118
00:06:17,667 --> 00:06:19,500
Can I use my powers to change?

119
00:06:19,534 --> 00:06:20,700
Can we use them for cooking?

120
00:06:20,734 --> 00:06:21,500
Absolutely...!

121
00:06:21,534 --> 00:06:23,634
Magic comes in
handy anywhere...!

122
00:06:23,667 --> 00:06:26,200
Have fun and good luck.

123
00:06:26,234 --> 00:06:30,300
Okay, water... will
you please boil?

124
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,434
During Akeno's lesson,
the only thing I could summon

125
00:06:35,467 --> 00:06:39,500
was a tiny ball of light, what'm
I supposed to do with this...?

126
00:06:39,534 --> 00:06:40,634
Ahhhh, Akeno.

127
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:44,234
Now there's some ripe ones
just begging to bust free.

128
00:06:51,367 --> 00:06:51,967
Sweet...!

129
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,567
It works on potatoes too!

130
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,267
Wow!

131
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:55,500
Look how good you're getting!

132
00:06:55,534 --> 00:06:56,200
Yeah...

133
00:06:56,234 --> 00:06:57,600
That wasn't too shabby, was it?

134
00:06:57,634 --> 00:06:59,700
Maybe I was just
having a bad day earlier.

135
00:06:59,734 --> 00:07:01,434
I'm so proud of you!

136
00:07:01,467 --> 00:07:02,600
Wait a second...

137
00:07:02,634 --> 00:07:03,867
This feels familiar...

138
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,867
It seems like
I've done this before?

139
00:07:07,867 --> 00:07:08,767
I remember...!

140
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,700
With Raynare...!

141
00:07:09,734 --> 00:07:12,534
The first time my
Sacred Gear deployed!

142
00:07:12,567 --> 00:07:13,800
That was easy!

143
00:07:13,834 --> 00:07:15,567
I can do this!

144
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,200
Check it out!

145
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,267
I'm like a Sacred
Gear Super Freak!

146
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,634
I think that's enough!

147
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,500
Oh my goodness...!

148
00:07:24,534 --> 00:07:33,167
What are we gonna
do with all of these?

149
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,534
Visualization is the
essence of all magic.

150
00:07:35,567 --> 00:07:37,534
Let the image of
light flow through you

151
00:07:37,567 --> 00:07:39,800
and be released
as magical power.

152
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:42,434
You can also be a
really hard worker.

153
00:07:42,467 --> 00:07:43,834
You're a pervert

154
00:07:45,867 --> 00:07:47,700
Don't you dare try to peel me.

155
00:07:47,734 --> 00:07:48,634
I would never!

156
00:07:48,667 --> 00:07:50,634
I'm just picturing you naked!

157
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,834
So how was it?

158
00:07:52,867 --> 00:07:53,734
Too small.

159
00:07:53,767 --> 00:07:54,734
No, I mean today.

160
00:07:54,767 --> 00:07:55,834
How do you think it went...?

161
00:07:55,867 --> 00:07:57,434
Did you learn anything new?

162
00:07:57,467 --> 00:07:58,700
I did...

163
00:07:58,734 --> 00:08:00,767
I learned I'm the
weakest link on this team.

164
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,334
Knowing is half the
battle, as they say.

165
00:08:03,367 --> 00:08:05,467
You shouldn't feel
entirely useless, though...

166
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,667
Between Asia's healing powers

167
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:09,500
and your Boosted Gear, the two
of you have become assets.

168
00:08:09,534 --> 00:08:11,567
Your opponent will
always be aware of this...

169
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,400
So I need you both to
gain at least enough power

170
00:08:13,434 --> 00:08:15,300
to escape from any situation,

171
00:08:15,334 --> 00:08:17,200
so that you won't slow
the rest of the team down.

172
00:08:17,234 --> 00:08:17,700
Yup...

173
00:08:17,734 --> 00:08:19,367
That makes sense.

174
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,367
Besides...

175
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,834
I'm the one who brought
Asia into this mess...

176
00:08:22,867 --> 00:08:24,067
All I want to do is learn enough

177
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:27,134
so that I can at least protect
her if we get into trouble.

178
00:08:29,834 --> 00:08:31,434
That was delicious
and filling...

179
00:08:31,467 --> 00:08:32,834
I think we should
head to the baths now.

180
00:08:32,867 --> 00:08:34,200
You're all going together?!

181
00:08:34,234 --> 00:08:35,434
That would be the plan...

182
00:08:35,467 --> 00:08:36,534
You're such a silly goose.

183
00:08:36,567 --> 00:08:37,834
Would you like to come along...?

184
00:08:37,867 --> 00:08:39,800
You want to see us
naked together, don't you?

185
00:08:39,834 --> 00:08:40,800
I don't mind.

186
00:08:40,834 --> 00:08:42,567
You, Akeno?

187
00:08:43,734 --> 00:08:45,900
No, I think it sounds like fun!

188
00:08:45,934 --> 00:08:47,567
We could bathe him, too!

189
00:08:48,334 --> 00:08:50,200
Would you mind if he came, Asia?

190
00:08:50,234 --> 00:08:51,800
I wouldn't want any of us
to feel uncomfortable.

191
00:08:51,834 --> 00:08:53,734
Sure!

192
00:08:53,767 --> 00:08:54,500
What about you?

193
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:55,734
I'd rather die.

194
00:08:55,767 --> 00:08:58,534
Oh well, sorry!

195
00:08:58,567 --> 00:09:00,200
Well that's just melodramatic.

196
00:09:00,234 --> 00:09:02,434
If you peek, I'll kill you.

197
00:09:04,667 --> 00:09:05,800
This was such a good idea.

198
00:09:05,834 --> 00:09:08,267
We haven't done this in forever!

199
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,934
I hope it melts away some of the
fatigue of training at least.

200
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,900
You've all been so working hard.

201
00:09:13,734 --> 00:09:16,534
I have no doubt
this will do the trick.

202
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:24,300
Sad you're not on
the Double D team?

203
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,267
Yeah...

204
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,867
I guess, a little.

205
00:09:32,734 --> 00:09:34,300
Should I leave you two alone...?

206
00:09:34,334 --> 00:09:35,867
You and that wall look
like you need your privacy.

207
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:36,767
Whatever!

208
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,734
This is part of my
training, you Idiot!

209
00:09:37,767 --> 00:09:40,300
They teaching you X-ray
vision or something,

210
00:09:40,334 --> 00:09:42,734
I didn't know that
was part of the routine.

211
00:09:44,467 --> 00:09:46,634
Name one thing that I'm
better at than other people.

212
00:09:46,667 --> 00:09:48,534
You're a pervert.

213
00:09:48,567 --> 00:09:50,834
If that's what my power
is, then so be it...!

214
00:09:50,867 --> 00:09:53,534
It was given to me
for a damn good reason!

215
00:10:12,896 --> 00:10:14,163
That's quite a story.

216
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:16,129
Indeed.

217
00:10:16,729 --> 00:10:18,729
Sounds just like Rias.

218
00:10:18,763 --> 00:10:21,229
Honestly, I don't think
she has any chance of winning.

219
00:10:21,263 --> 00:10:22,163
No...

220
00:10:22,196 --> 00:10:23,863
That, she does not.

221
00:10:23,896 --> 00:10:26,163
But you let her go through
with the training anyway?

222
00:10:26,196 --> 00:10:28,263
I let her make
her own decision...

223
00:10:28,296 --> 00:10:32,163
She's next in line to be head of
the house of Gremory, after all.

224
00:10:32,196 --> 00:10:35,163
I seriously hope she's
capable of at least that.

225
00:10:35,196 --> 00:10:36,963
As do I.

226
00:10:46,829 --> 00:10:47,296
Asia...

227
00:10:47,329 --> 00:10:48,963
Hey!

228
00:10:51,029 --> 00:10:51,896
Issei!

229
00:10:51,929 --> 00:10:52,829
What are you--

230
00:10:52,863 --> 00:10:53,529
I'm sorry.

231
00:10:53,563 --> 00:10:54,996
I hate to wake you up like this.

232
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:55,929
It's just that...

233
00:10:55,963 --> 00:10:56,896
I need you...

234
00:10:56,929 --> 00:10:58,696
You're the only one
who can help me do this.

235
00:10:58,729 --> 00:11:00,296
What?

236
00:11:00,329 --> 00:11:02,063
What's going on?

237
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:04,863
Just focus...

238
00:11:04,896 --> 00:11:06,896
You can do this, Issei!

239
00:11:13,396 --> 00:11:14,796
Oh, Issei!

240
00:11:14,829 --> 00:11:15,896
I have an idea.

241
00:11:15,929 --> 00:11:18,329
But I'm gonna need to
borrow some of your clothes.

242
00:11:18,363 --> 00:11:19,963
I know you need this!

243
00:11:21,229 --> 00:11:30,796
I just hope we have enough time!

244
00:11:30,829 --> 00:11:32,063
Good question.

245
00:11:32,096 --> 00:11:34,029
The answer dates
back quite a bit...

246
00:11:34,063 --> 00:11:36,296
Some would say close
to an eternity ago.

247
00:11:36,329 --> 00:11:37,596
Devils, Fallen Angels,

248
00:11:37,629 --> 00:11:39,296
and Heavenly Angels
were at war...

249
00:11:39,329 --> 00:11:42,329
It was a massive,
destructive three-sided battle,

250
00:11:42,363 --> 00:11:45,063
which ultimately ended in
neither victory nor defeat...

251
00:11:45,096 --> 00:11:46,863
Every single battle fought ended

252
00:11:46,896 --> 00:11:51,196
with several of our
members wiped out or missing.

253
00:11:51,229 --> 00:11:54,229
Our life spans--since devils
have very low birth rates--

254
00:11:54,263 --> 00:11:56,929
are nearly eternal to
insure our population...

255
00:11:56,963 --> 00:11:59,229
Yet our existence as
a species is at risk due

256
00:11:59,263 --> 00:12:01,329
to the impact of that war.

257
00:12:01,363 --> 00:12:03,163
Most of the family
lines consisted

258
00:12:03,196 --> 00:12:04,929
of pureblood, upper-class devils

259
00:12:04,963 --> 00:12:07,863
that made up what is
known as the 72 Pillars.

260
00:12:07,896 --> 00:12:09,896
The war then
claimed all but three.

261
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:11,996
Mine, which is the
House of Gremory.

262
00:12:12,029 --> 00:12:14,029
Sona's, the House of Sitri.

263
00:12:14,063 --> 00:12:16,329
And Riser's, the
House of Phoenix.

264
00:12:16,363 --> 00:12:20,263
Out of 72 Pillars,
we are the only survivors.

265
00:12:20,296 --> 00:12:22,796
It was then that devils
first began recruiting humans

266
00:12:22,829 --> 00:12:25,296
to replace the numbers
in their houses.

267
00:12:25,329 --> 00:12:29,596
After that, The Rating
Game came about.

268
00:12:29,629 --> 00:12:31,096
This allowed devils
that were the masters

269
00:12:31,129 --> 00:12:33,729
of their households to provide
recently converted humans

270
00:12:33,763 --> 00:12:37,896
with combat experience--as well
as show off their own abilities.

271
00:12:37,929 --> 00:12:40,063
Nowadays it still
has quite an impact,

272
00:12:40,096 --> 00:12:42,363
one's record in the Rating
Game has a huge influence

273
00:12:42,396 --> 00:12:44,629
on their nobility and status.

274
00:12:46,229 --> 00:12:47,263
Okay I think that's it.

275
00:12:47,296 --> 00:12:48,796
You guys look pretty tired...

276
00:12:48,829 --> 00:12:50,996
What do you say we take
a break and have some tea?

277
00:12:51,029 --> 00:12:52,263
Sounds good.

278
00:12:52,296 --> 00:12:53,196
I'll go make it.

279
00:12:53,229 --> 00:12:53,729
Oh! Wait a minute.

280
00:12:53,763 --> 00:12:54,763
I'll come help you!

281
00:12:54,796 --> 00:12:56,063
Hang on, Asia.

282
00:12:56,763 --> 00:12:58,096
I'm sorry about last night.

283
00:12:58,129 --> 00:13:00,663
Oh, that's okay!

284
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:02,596
You're getting so much stronger!

285
00:13:02,629 --> 00:13:04,063
The way that you--

286
00:13:04,096 --> 00:13:05,696
I wanna keep this
just between us...

287
00:13:05,729 --> 00:13:06,363
Is that cool?

288
00:13:06,396 --> 00:13:07,329
Like a secret?

289
00:13:07,363 --> 00:13:09,229
Yeah, I think I just
need a little more time

290
00:13:09,263 --> 00:13:10,796
to perfect it on my own...

291
00:13:10,829 --> 00:13:12,629
Ya know, to make
it battle ready?

292
00:13:12,663 --> 00:13:13,663
Absolutely...

293
00:13:13,696 --> 00:13:15,763
This new move is definitely
worth waiting for,

294
00:13:15,796 --> 00:13:16,896
so you shouldn't rush...

295
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:18,696
Let me know if you need my help!

296
00:13:18,729 --> 00:13:19,596
What new move?

297
00:13:19,629 --> 00:13:20,929
We can't tell you yet.

298
00:13:20,963 --> 00:13:22,196
I almost forgot, Asia.

299
00:13:22,229 --> 00:13:23,129
I'd love to learn more

300
00:13:23,163 --> 00:13:25,196
about your former
life as a Holy Sister.

301
00:13:25,229 --> 00:13:28,363
You mean right now?

302
00:13:28,396 --> 00:13:29,329
Let's see...

303
00:13:29,363 --> 00:13:30,896
I did a lot of exorcisms

304
00:13:30,929 --> 00:13:32,329
so I guess we could
talk about that...

305
00:13:32,363 --> 00:13:34,063
There are two things you need.

306
00:13:34,096 --> 00:13:36,863
The most important one...
is holy water...

307
00:13:36,896 --> 00:13:38,263
But Devils need to be careful...

308
00:13:38,296 --> 00:13:41,363
It's vital that you
never actually touch it.

309
00:13:41,396 --> 00:13:42,863
Is it gonna make us melt?!

310
00:13:42,896 --> 00:13:44,863
It will do something bad.

311
00:13:44,896 --> 00:13:46,063
I figured that much...

312
00:13:46,096 --> 00:13:46,863
I don't know why
you're leaving out

313
00:13:46,896 --> 00:13:48,729
all the cool parts
of this story.

314
00:13:48,763 --> 00:13:49,896
It isn't just us...

315
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:51,363
This goes for you, too.

316
00:13:51,396 --> 00:13:53,196
You're a devil now, remember?

317
00:13:54,329 --> 00:13:55,929
Yeah, I know...

318
00:13:55,963 --> 00:13:58,729
I guess there's no point
talking about how to make it...

319
00:13:58,763 --> 00:14:00,729
So let's just move on
to something else...

320
00:14:00,763 --> 00:14:02,129
The second item is...

321
00:14:02,163 --> 00:14:04,163
The Holy Bible...

322
00:14:04,196 --> 00:14:06,729
I used to read it constantly
when I was a little girl...

323
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:08,263
It was my favorite...

324
00:14:08,296 --> 00:14:10,063
but now every time
I start a verse,

325
00:14:10,096 --> 00:14:13,029
I get a terrible headache
and I can't get through it!

326
00:14:13,063 --> 00:14:14,363
Because you're a devil.

327
00:14:14,396 --> 00:14:16,163
You're one of us now, Asia.

328
00:14:16,196 --> 00:14:17,796
You should write it down.

329
00:14:18,696 --> 00:14:20,329
Probably not a good idea.

330
00:14:20,363 --> 00:14:21,796
I just want to read one verse!

331
00:14:21,829 --> 00:14:23,196
It was always my favorite...!

332
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:25,129
Okay, here it is.

333
00:14:25,163 --> 00:14:26,229
I didn't start yet!

334
00:14:26,263 --> 00:14:29,229
Dear Lord, forgive me
for not reading Your words.

335
00:14:29,263 --> 00:14:32,296
I promise I've tried, uh...

336
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:34,096
Why do you hate me...?!

337
00:14:34,129 --> 00:14:35,363
Ow-ow-ow!

338
00:14:35,396 --> 00:14:37,196
If it was anyone else,
I'd think she was doing

339
00:14:37,229 --> 00:14:40,229
a bit right now, but
I guess probably not.

340
00:14:40,263 --> 00:14:41,963
And Asia's stronger than I am.

341
00:14:41,996 --> 00:14:44,763
If it hurts her this much,
I wonder what it'd do to me.

342
00:14:55,732 --> 00:14:56,699
Issei?

343
00:14:56,732 --> 00:14:59,065
Oh hey, Rias...

344
00:14:59,099 --> 00:15:00,132
Why are you still up...?

345
00:15:00,165 --> 00:15:01,765
Getting kinda late, isn't it?

346
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:02,765
What perfect timing...

347
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:06,032
I need to chat with you
about something anyway.

348
00:15:10,432 --> 00:15:11,032
Wow.

349
00:15:11,065 --> 00:15:12,599
So that's the attack plan?

350
00:15:12,632 --> 00:15:13,565
It is...

351
00:15:13,599 --> 00:15:15,732
But it's not a very
good one, I'm afraid...

352
00:15:15,765 --> 00:15:16,665
According to this manual,

353
00:15:16,699 --> 00:15:18,632
we still have a lot
to be worried about.

354
00:15:18,665 --> 00:15:20,065
But it's gotta work, right?

355
00:15:20,099 --> 00:15:21,332
You've been busting
your ass on all this.

356
00:15:21,365 --> 00:15:23,232
I mean, you don't
even sleep anymore!

357
00:15:23,265 --> 00:15:24,232
Doesn't matter...

358
00:15:24,265 --> 00:15:26,465
We can't control what
the opponent will do...

359
00:15:26,499 --> 00:15:28,699
You realize we're up
against Phoenix, right?

360
00:15:28,732 --> 00:15:32,399
And let me assure you,
the name is most appropriate.

361
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:34,165
A devil...

362
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:37,032
But he is also a marquis
counted among the 72 Pillars...

363
00:15:37,065 --> 00:15:39,065
We've got our
work cut out for us.

364
00:15:40,599 --> 00:15:43,665
His ability is the same as the
beast his family's named after.

365
00:15:43,699 --> 00:15:46,065
Immortality.

366
00:15:46,099 --> 00:15:47,265
Is that allowed...?!

367
00:15:47,299 --> 00:15:49,332
How is it even possible?

368
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:50,365
It just is...

369
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,032
He's indestructible...

370
00:15:52,065 --> 00:15:54,665
He regenerates immediately
following an attack

371
00:15:55,665 --> 00:15:58,399
Riser's win-lose
ratio is eight to two...

372
00:15:58,432 --> 00:16:01,099
However, those two
losses were accepted out

373
00:16:01,132 --> 00:16:03,765
of respect for a
family he's close to...

374
00:16:03,799 --> 00:16:05,432
He lost on purpose.

375
00:16:08,632 --> 00:16:11,132
Ever since the Rating Game
was put into effect,

376
00:16:11,165 --> 00:16:13,599
the House of Phoenix has
dominated the playing field.

377
00:16:13,632 --> 00:16:16,565
They've always had
the highest score.

378
00:16:16,599 --> 00:16:20,032
Can't say I'm surprised.

379
00:16:20,065 --> 00:16:23,165
How are you supposed to
lose if you're immortal.

380
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:24,565
I'm so sorry, Rias!

381
00:16:24,599 --> 00:16:25,799
About what?

382
00:16:25,832 --> 00:16:26,799
I'm the one who told Riser

383
00:16:26,832 --> 00:16:28,765
where to stick it and
now he wants to fight...

384
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:30,499
Should've kept
my fat mouth shut!

385
00:16:30,532 --> 00:16:31,732
Not at all.

386
00:16:31,765 --> 00:16:33,632
In fact, thanks to you, I'll
get a chance to tell my father

387
00:16:33,665 --> 00:16:35,332
and the others
where to 'stick it.'

388
00:16:35,365 --> 00:16:38,365
They set up this Game because
they all anticipate me losing.

389
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,632
And now I'll be able to change
the score and prove them wrong.

390
00:16:41,665 --> 00:16:43,699
In our chess, this is
called a swindle...

391
00:16:43,732 --> 00:16:46,099
or a trap-maneuver.

392
00:16:46,132 --> 00:16:46,932
Yeah, well...

393
00:16:46,965 --> 00:16:48,299
I'm just glad you're
not going along

394
00:16:48,332 --> 00:16:50,032
with this bullshit
marriage proposal.

395
00:16:50,065 --> 00:16:51,565
That takes balls.

396
00:16:52,499 --> 00:16:55,599
The proposal was to the
heiress of the House of Gremory.

397
00:16:55,632 --> 00:16:59,299
Because of my title, I am
not ever recognized as Rias.

398
00:16:59,332 --> 00:17:03,199
The House of Gremory will
always come before me...

399
00:17:03,232 --> 00:17:04,132
I've learned to adjust to it;

400
00:17:04,165 --> 00:17:06,665
and make personal
decisions accordingly.

401
00:17:07,699 --> 00:17:08,765
Make no mistake,

402
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:11,365
my title is something
I will always take pride in.

403
00:17:11,399 --> 00:17:13,499
But when it comes to
the subject of marriage,

404
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:16,432
I want to share that with
someone who loves me as Rias--

405
00:17:16,465 --> 00:17:19,099
not for how my status
can improve their life.

406
00:17:19,132 --> 00:17:21,399
Otherwise, they may as
well marry the House.

407
00:17:21,432 --> 00:17:23,632
I understand that history
is not in my favor,

408
00:17:23,665 --> 00:17:26,065
and the idea of love
may just remain a dream.

409
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:27,532
But it's one I'd like to keep.

410
00:17:27,565 --> 00:17:28,565
Whatever!

411
00:17:28,599 --> 00:17:29,732
I like you and I don't care
what your name is!

412
00:17:29,765 --> 00:17:31,532
I like you for who you are!

413
00:17:31,565 --> 00:17:33,165
The Gremory name
doesn't define you...

414
00:17:33,199 --> 00:17:35,032
It's just an empty
title and anyone

415
00:17:35,065 --> 00:17:37,432
who thinks otherwise
doesn't know you.

416
00:17:37,465 --> 00:17:38,532
You're incredible...

417
00:17:38,565 --> 00:17:40,199
I mean, come on...

418
00:17:40,232 --> 00:17:42,199
Look at everything
that you've done for me...

419
00:17:42,232 --> 00:17:45,465
I just hope someday
I can pay you back.

420
00:17:45,499 --> 00:17:46,232
What...?

421
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:46,932
What happened...?

422
00:17:46,965 --> 00:17:49,165
Did I say something wrong again?

423
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:50,599
Of course not.

424
00:17:50,632 --> 00:17:51,732
It's nothing.

425
00:17:51,765 --> 00:17:52,699
Anyway, the point is:

426
00:17:52,732 --> 00:17:55,099
If we're going to fight,
we're going to win.

427
00:17:55,132 --> 00:17:56,532
I know you're called
the Princess of Ruin

428
00:17:56,565 --> 00:17:58,432
and the Empress
of Annihilation...

429
00:17:58,465 --> 00:18:00,365
Nobody earns themselves
nicknames like that

430
00:18:00,399 --> 00:18:02,165
if they're easy to
beat, am I right...?

431
00:18:02,199 --> 00:18:05,065
There's no way a guy named after
a bird can stand up to you.

432
00:18:05,099 --> 00:18:06,665
Not true.

433
00:18:07,532 --> 00:18:08,365
My powers are strong

434
00:18:08,399 --> 00:18:11,065
but I can't heal
myself the way he can.

435
00:18:11,099 --> 00:18:12,732
My strength lies
in my entire team

436
00:18:12,765 --> 00:18:14,699
and our ability
to fight together...

437
00:18:14,732 --> 00:18:17,399
which means I need
never battle alone.

438
00:18:18,465 --> 00:18:20,632
When I fight,
Gremory fights with me...

439
00:18:20,665 --> 00:18:23,399
but if I lose,
Gremory does as well.

440
00:18:23,432 --> 00:18:25,532
Winning is the only option.

441
00:18:26,265 --> 00:18:27,099
You're amazing.

442
00:18:27,132 --> 00:18:29,065
I can't imagine
that kind of strength.

443
00:18:29,099 --> 00:18:31,632
I keep trying to make
you proud, but I'm just...

444
00:18:31,665 --> 00:18:33,465
a failure!

445
00:18:33,499 --> 00:18:35,765
No, you're not.

446
00:18:35,799 --> 00:18:36,699
It's really okay.

447
00:18:36,732 --> 00:18:38,399
I need to start accepting it...

448
00:18:38,432 --> 00:18:41,765
The signs have always been
there, I just refused to see.

449
00:18:42,332 --> 00:18:43,465
Even with the Sacred Gear,

450
00:18:43,499 --> 00:18:45,265
I've been the least
useful to you...

451
00:18:45,299 --> 00:18:47,465
That says a lot,
don't you think?

452
00:18:47,499 --> 00:18:49,799
I keep throwing myself into
things as if I can help...

453
00:18:49,832 --> 00:18:52,432
and I end up making
everything worse.

454
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:53,299
You don't need me...

455
00:18:53,332 --> 00:18:56,399
I mean I'm just...
a freaking loser!

456
00:18:57,399 --> 00:18:59,165
That's not true, Issei.

457
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:01,199
You just lack confidence.

458
00:19:01,232 --> 00:19:02,432
But don't worry...

459
00:19:02,465 --> 00:19:05,199
that's something I'll be more
than happy to help you with.

460
00:19:05,232 --> 00:19:07,165
What are you saying?

461
00:19:07,199 --> 00:19:09,065
You'll know soon.

462
00:19:09,099 --> 00:19:11,065
But for now, go get some rest...

463
00:19:11,099 --> 00:19:14,165
Both your body and mind have
been through a lot today...

464
00:19:14,199 --> 00:19:17,465
I'll stay by your side
until you fall asleep.

465
00:19:20,532 --> 00:19:23,165
It's going to be okay, Issei...

466
00:19:23,199 --> 00:19:24,699
You have my word...

467
00:19:24,732 --> 00:19:27,065
You will come to
believe in yourself.

468
00:19:31,132 --> 00:19:32,665
You're gonna need to
use your Boosted Gear...

469
00:19:32,699 --> 00:19:33,932
Can you handle it?

470
00:19:33,965 --> 00:19:37,599
Of course, but you said not to
use it during training camp...

471
00:19:37,632 --> 00:19:38,799
You change your mind?

472
00:19:38,832 --> 00:19:41,265
You weren't supposed to use
it without my permission...

473
00:19:41,299 --> 00:19:43,265
Kiba, would you mind
partnering with him?

474
00:19:43,299 --> 00:19:44,765
No. Not at all.

475
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:48,732
I'm not going easy on you.

476
00:19:48,765 --> 00:19:50,232
Neither am I...!

477
00:19:50,265 --> 00:19:51,132
Boosted Gear!

478
00:19:51,165 --> 00:19:53,099

Keep it going!

488
00:20:02,432 --> 00:20:03,499
Boosted Gear!

00:20:04,532 --> 00:20:05,565
Keep it up, Issei!

00:20:07,099 --> 00:20:07,699
Boost!

493
00:20:07,732 --> 00:20:08,665
Again!

494
00:20:08,699 --> 00:20:09,732
Boosted Gear, Go!

495
00:20:09,765 --> 00:20:10,499
Give me more!

496
00:20:10,532 --> 00:20:11,565
We can do this!

497
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:13,299
Boost!

498
00:20:13,332 --> 00:20:15,699
Twelve power-ups in a row
that's a record, isn't it?

499
00:20:15,732 --> 00:20:17,132
Alright, stop...!

500
00:20:17,165 --> 00:20:19,532
Can you see how
far you've come...?

501
00:20:19,565 --> 00:20:20,665
You've never been able

502
00:20:20,699 --> 00:20:23,599
to endure this much power
for this long in the past.

503
00:20:26,699 --> 00:20:29,699
The results of your training
were abundantly clear just then.

504
00:20:29,732 --> 00:20:31,099
Holy crap!

505
00:20:31,132 --> 00:20:32,332
Let's keep moving!

506
00:20:32,365 --> 00:20:33,199
All right...

507
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,332
Boosted Gear!

508
00:20:35,365 --> 00:20:37,099
Explosion!

509
00:20:39,132 --> 00:20:39,899
What's he doing?

510
00:20:39,932 --> 00:20:41,599
Perfecting a new
call, it seems...

511
00:20:41,632 --> 00:20:42,465
This should allow him

512
00:20:42,499 --> 00:20:44,199
to gather all the
power in his body

513
00:20:44,232 --> 00:20:46,599
and unleash it in
one massive blow.

514
00:20:46,632 --> 00:20:48,699
You're up, Kiba!

515
00:20:54,599 --> 00:20:59,665
Okay, Issei, try using
it all on him, now!

516
00:20:59,699 --> 00:21:01,532
What? That's all I have?

517
00:21:01,565 --> 00:21:03,265
Trust yourself!

518
00:21:17,265 --> 00:21:19,365
Looks like it worked.

519
00:21:19,399 --> 00:21:21,299
You broke the mountain.

520
00:21:21,332 --> 00:21:24,299
I can't believe that
came out of Issei.

521
00:21:24,832 --> 00:21:25,765
Woah...

522
00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:27,665
That did a lot more
than I thought it would.

523
00:21:28,765 --> 00:21:29,532
Issei...!

524
00:21:29,565 --> 00:21:30,765
Are you okay?

525
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:33,365
Looks like he used up all of
his strength on that last one...

526
00:21:33,399 --> 00:21:34,399
So what do you think...?

527
00:21:34,432 --> 00:21:35,599
He's improving, isn't he?

528
00:21:35,632 --> 00:21:36,499
I'll say...

529
00:21:36,532 --> 00:21:38,365
I didn't expect him
to be that strong.

530
00:21:38,399 --> 00:21:40,065
That last move was way better

531
00:21:40,099 --> 00:21:43,432
than anything he's
ever thrown at me.

532
00:21:43,465 --> 00:21:44,399
Issei!

533
00:21:44,432 --> 00:21:46,465
You have become the
linchpin of this Game.

534
00:21:46,499 --> 00:21:48,432
Your attack will critically
affect the direction

535
00:21:48,465 --> 00:21:50,299
in which this
competition moves...

536
00:21:50,332 --> 00:21:52,565
Trust in us...
and more importantly,

537
00:21:52,599 --> 00:21:55,199
you must trust in yourself.

538
00:21:55,232 --> 00:21:57,232
I trust you...

539
00:21:57,265 --> 00:21:59,999
And I know I can handle this!

540
00:22:02,632 --> 00:22:04,332
He can do this.

541
00:22:04,365 --> 00:22:06,232
You're incredible...

542
00:22:06,265 --> 00:22:07,232
I mean, come on...

543
00:22:07,265 --> 00:22:09,365
Look at everything that
you've done for me...

544
00:22:09,399 --> 00:22:11,232
I just hope I can pay you back.

545
00:23:48,699 --> 00:23:49,732
Rias...

546
00:23:49,765 --> 00:23:52,032
I want you to know
I could die happy right now...

547
00:23:52,065 --> 00:23:55,032
This is one of the
top ten moments of my life.

548
00:23:55,065 --> 00:23:57,432
Why on Earth are you crying?

549
00:23:59,265 --> 00:24:00,099
I did it!

550
00:24:00,132 --> 00:24:02,099
Rise and shine and
go kick some ass!
