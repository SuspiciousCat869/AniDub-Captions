1
00:00:18,066 --> 00:00:20,000
Damn you whoever you are!

2
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,333
I'm sorry.

3
00:00:22,366 --> 00:00:23,266
Hold on Koneko.

4
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:24,600
I just wanted...

5
00:00:24,633 --> 00:00:26,733
I just wanted to
serve Rias well.

6
00:00:26,766 --> 00:00:27,933
It's all right...

7
00:00:27,966 --> 00:00:30,466
We'll get you to Asia, and
she'll heal you up in no time.

8
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:33,500
No, don't go...!

9
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:35,166
Stay with me!

10
00:02:16,895 --> 00:02:20,661
One of Lady Rias'
rooks... retired.

11
00:02:21,495 --> 00:02:22,228
Damn it...!

12
00:02:22,261 --> 00:02:23,495
You killed Koneko!

13
00:02:23,528 --> 00:02:26,261
Get down here and see
how you do against me!

14
00:02:26,295 --> 00:02:27,661
Calm down, Issei...

15
00:02:27,695 --> 00:02:29,561
When someone can longer fight,

16
00:02:29,595 --> 00:02:31,561
they're transferred to a
more appropriate location,

17
00:02:31,595 --> 00:02:33,495
where they're treated
for their injuries...

18
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:35,228
Koneko is not dead.

19
00:02:35,261 --> 00:02:37,295
You need to try and focus.

20
00:02:37,328 --> 00:02:38,261
But Rias!

21
00:02:38,295 --> 00:02:39,928
It's time to give up
the fight, little boy.

22
00:02:39,961 --> 00:02:42,395
No matter how hard you
struggle, you won't win.

23
00:02:42,428 --> 00:02:43,695
You can't win.

24
00:02:44,861 --> 00:02:46,495
Well this is exciting.

25
00:02:46,528 --> 00:02:47,295
Akeno!

26
00:02:47,328 --> 00:02:48,428
Issei...

27
00:02:48,461 --> 00:02:51,461
I can take care of this trash;
you go on ahead, okay?

28
00:02:51,495 --> 00:02:54,295
Oh... and don't worry,
I'll make sure she pays.

29
00:02:54,328 --> 00:02:56,528
"Make me pay"; how exciting!

30
00:02:56,561 --> 00:02:59,628
I'll be fine, Issei, just go!

31
00:02:59,661 --> 00:03:01,895
Whatever you say; just get her!

32
00:03:01,928 --> 00:03:04,595
I've been wanting to fight you
for what seems like ages...

33
00:03:04,628 --> 00:03:05,861
Priestess of Thunder.

34
00:03:05,895 --> 00:03:06,928
Oh, have you...?

35
00:03:06,961 --> 00:03:09,795
That's sweet, but the
pleasure is truly mine...

36
00:03:09,828 --> 00:03:11,695
Bomb Queen.

37
00:03:13,995 --> 00:03:16,695
Three of Lord Riser's
pawns... retired.

38
00:03:16,728 --> 00:03:17,595
Whoa, three of them?

39
00:03:17,628 --> 00:03:19,495
That's crazy!

40
00:03:20,728 --> 00:03:21,628
Hey!

41
00:03:21,661 --> 00:03:23,228
Kiba, you're okay!

42
00:03:23,261 --> 00:03:23,961
Wait...!

43
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:25,595
Those three outs, was that you?

44
00:03:25,628 --> 00:03:27,228
Yeah, thanks to Akeno's barrier.

45
00:03:27,261 --> 00:03:29,761
She made it pretty easy for me.

46
00:03:30,828 --> 00:03:32,928
Currently, the remaining
pieces on Lord Riser's side

47
00:03:32,961 --> 00:03:34,628
have the advantage at nine...

48
00:03:34,661 --> 00:03:36,995
Lady Rias has
only five players left.

49
00:03:37,028 --> 00:03:39,928
They cannot afford to
get careless, though.

50
00:03:39,961 --> 00:03:41,628
Did you hear that
we lost Koneko?

51
00:03:41,661 --> 00:03:42,695
Yeah, I heard...

52
00:03:42,728 --> 00:03:45,428
None of us knew how close
she was to her limit...

53
00:03:45,461 --> 00:03:47,728
She was really on fire today...

54
00:03:47,761 --> 00:03:49,961
I'm sure she was
disappointed, though.

55
00:03:51,328 --> 00:03:53,795
I don't care how,
but we're gonna win this!

56
00:03:53,828 --> 00:03:54,895
Yeah...

57
00:03:54,928 --> 00:03:57,295
You're damn right we are!

58
00:03:58,761 --> 00:04:01,228
Kiba, Issei, do you read me?

59
00:04:01,261 --> 00:04:03,561
I'm launching a sneak attack
on their base with Asia.

60
00:04:03,595 --> 00:04:05,528
I want you to draw as
many of the enemy away

61
00:04:05,561 --> 00:04:08,361
from the entrance as
you can to buy us time.

62
00:04:08,395 --> 00:04:08,928
Is that safe?

63
00:04:08,961 --> 00:04:10,395
I'm left with no choice;

64
00:04:10,428 --> 00:04:12,261
I was planning to give
Akeno time to recover

65
00:04:12,295 --> 00:04:14,895
so she could blast them
one by one, but now...

66
00:04:14,928 --> 00:04:17,728
Riser sent his queen,
so I need her focus there.

67
00:04:17,761 --> 00:04:19,695
Yes, of course...
but don't you think

68
00:04:19,728 --> 00:04:22,395
it's too risky to have
the king leave the base?

69
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:25,461
With any luck, Riser will be
thinking along the same lines...

70
00:04:25,495 --> 00:04:27,895
Here's hoping I can
take him by surprise.

71
00:04:27,928 --> 00:04:29,995
If we can strike him
strong and hard enough,

72
00:04:30,028 --> 00:04:32,795
we might just be able to take
the fight out of him and win.

73
00:04:32,828 --> 00:04:36,295
His body may be immortal,
but his heart is not...

74
00:04:36,328 --> 00:04:38,528
And trust me, I will have
no problem whatsoever

75
00:04:38,561 --> 00:04:41,528
breaking that
devil's black heart.

76
00:04:41,895 --> 00:04:43,495
Well, since that's decided...

77
00:04:43,528 --> 00:04:46,361
Let's show them what the
Occult Research Club can do!

78
00:04:46,395 --> 00:04:48,661
Balls to the wall, my friend.

79
00:04:51,361 --> 00:04:53,528
Hey...! We know
you're hiding out there...

80
00:04:53,561 --> 00:04:56,828
Quit acting like a bunch of
pansies and come fight us!

81
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:06,961
I am Karlamine, a knight in
the service of Lord Riser!

82
00:05:06,995 --> 00:05:09,428
To be perfectly honest,
requesting to be attacked

83
00:05:09,461 --> 00:05:11,895
by us makes me
question your sanity.

84
00:05:11,928 --> 00:05:16,695
Although... far be it from me to
refuse an idiot his reckoning!

85
00:05:17,395 --> 00:05:20,495
I am Kiba Yuto, a knight in
the service of Lady Rias...

86
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:21,695
I sure hope you're ready...

87
00:05:21,728 --> 00:05:24,495
I've been looking forward
to battling another knight...

88
00:05:24,528 --> 00:05:26,328
Can't wait to get started.

89
00:05:26,361 --> 00:05:27,695
Very well said...

90
00:05:27,728 --> 00:05:30,295
En Garde, knight
of Rias Gremory!

91
00:05:38,595 --> 00:05:39,561
Awesome...!

92
00:05:39,595 --> 00:05:41,561
Guess it'd be rude to
get in the middle of it.

93
00:05:41,595 --> 00:05:43,528
Plus you'll be busy.

94
00:05:43,561 --> 00:05:45,528
Oh, that Karlamine...

95
00:05:45,561 --> 00:05:46,695
Her head is filled with nothing

96
00:05:46,728 --> 00:05:49,661
but swords, swords, swords,
it's freaking ridiculous.

97
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:50,928
She was way too bothered

98
00:05:50,961 --> 00:05:53,528
by those other pieces
we sacrificed, too...

99
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:55,895
You ask me, she needs
to get it together.

100
00:05:55,928 --> 00:05:59,261
And now, right when I think
I've found a cute boy...

101
00:05:59,295 --> 00:06:02,895
Turns out he's a
sword freak, too.

102
00:06:02,928 --> 00:06:07,695
Guess this just isn't
my lucky day, now is it?

103
00:06:07,728 --> 00:06:10,261
Looks like they've brought out
all of their remaining pieces...

104
00:06:10,295 --> 00:06:12,328
Way to go, Rias;
you guessed right.

105
00:06:16,261 --> 00:06:18,361
And what am I even looking at?

106
00:06:18,395 --> 00:06:20,895
Lady Rias has the
worst taste in boys.

107
00:06:20,928 --> 00:06:23,828
Cute girl with a bad attitude;
you're so clichÃ©...!

108
00:06:23,861 --> 00:06:25,895
Boosted Gear!

109
00:06:25,928 --> 00:06:26,795
Boost!

110
00:06:26,828 --> 00:06:28,361
Please, don't point
that thing at me;

111
00:06:28,395 --> 00:06:30,495
I have no intention
of fighting you.

112
00:06:30,528 --> 00:06:31,761
What?

113
00:06:31,795 --> 00:06:33,661
Isabela.

114
00:06:35,761 --> 00:06:36,828
My name is Isabela,

115
00:06:36,861 --> 00:06:38,295
and I am a rook in service

116
00:06:38,328 --> 00:06:40,761
of the honorable
Lord Riser Phoenix.

117
00:06:40,795 --> 00:06:42,261
Prepare yourself to fight...

118
00:06:42,295 --> 00:06:45,961
Pawn of Rias Gremory!

119
00:06:45,995 --> 00:06:46,895
Hey, hold on!

120
00:06:46,928 --> 00:06:48,095
What's wrong with that one?

121
00:06:48,128 --> 00:06:50,695
What do you mean you have
no intention of fighting, huh?

122
00:06:50,728 --> 00:06:52,961
She is serving in this
battle as a bishop...

123
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:55,461
But for the most part,
she likes to watch.

124
00:06:55,495 --> 00:06:56,261
Why?

125
00:06:56,295 --> 00:06:58,795
Because the lady
is Ravel Phoenix.

126
00:06:58,828 --> 00:07:00,395
Phoenix?

127
00:07:01,428 --> 00:07:03,261
Ravel is one of the
Phoenix household devils,

128
00:07:03,295 --> 00:07:05,395
but she is also
Lord Riser's sister.

129
00:07:05,428 --> 00:07:06,895
His sister?

130
00:07:07,795 --> 00:07:08,961
Oh?

131
00:07:08,995 --> 00:07:10,961
You think it's creepy that
I have my sister in my harem...?

132
00:07:10,995 --> 00:07:12,895
You're just jealous of Riser.

133
00:07:12,928 --> 00:07:14,128
Fear not.

134
00:07:14,161 --> 00:07:16,661
She's part of my team because
she needed something to do.

135
00:07:16,695 --> 00:07:19,361
I don't have a
thing for my sister.

136
00:07:19,395 --> 00:07:21,561
At least that's what he says.

137
00:07:21,595 --> 00:07:25,395
That bastard is a sicko
on top of being a tool!

138
00:07:25,428 --> 00:07:26,495
Although, to be fair,

139
00:07:26,528 --> 00:07:28,961
I get why he'd want her
in his harem, sister or not.

140
00:07:30,761 --> 00:07:33,428
You're better than I expected.

141
00:07:33,461 --> 00:07:34,328
Well, I didn't just train

142
00:07:34,361 --> 00:07:36,761
with Koneko and Kiba
for the fun of it!

143
00:07:40,595 --> 00:07:41,995
All I have to do is power up...

144
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:45,728
Just a few more times.

145
00:07:46,395 --> 00:07:47,061
Boost!

146
00:07:47,095 --> 00:07:48,261
That's my fifth time boosting...

147
00:07:48,295 --> 00:07:52,261
Might be enough against a pawn,
but this D-cup is a rook.

148
00:07:53,461 --> 00:07:54,261
You know...

149
00:07:54,295 --> 00:07:56,728
You're no me,
but you've improved

150
00:07:56,761 --> 00:07:57,895
since Mira knocked
you to the floor.

151
00:07:57,928 --> 00:07:59,528
My congratulations to Rias;

152
00:07:59,561 --> 00:08:01,295
it looks like she
trained you well.

153
00:08:01,328 --> 00:08:02,895
First off...

154
00:08:02,928 --> 00:08:04,728
It was the ceiling
not the floor...

155
00:08:04,761 --> 00:08:07,595
And... Thank you
for the compliment!

156
00:08:07,628 --> 00:08:09,428
I trained like crazy for her...

157
00:08:09,461 --> 00:08:12,628
so you'll understand
when I kick your ass!

158
00:08:16,695 --> 00:08:19,661
Riser's been expecting you...

159
00:08:21,395 --> 00:08:24,295
Hello, my beloved Rias.

160
00:08:25,661 --> 00:08:26,895
My Holy Eraser!

161
00:08:26,928 --> 00:08:27,895
Unfortunately for you,

162
00:08:27,928 --> 00:08:30,428
that attack doesn't work
against someone like me.

163
00:08:30,461 --> 00:08:32,528
Oh really, what
about this one...?

164
00:08:32,561 --> 00:08:35,961
Freeze!

165
00:08:35,995 --> 00:08:36,895
You've gotta be kidding;

166
00:08:36,928 --> 00:08:39,795
there's no way you
have two Sacred Gears!

167
00:08:44,361 --> 00:08:46,528
No matter,
I still control flame!

168
00:08:46,561 --> 00:08:48,295
And wind, and life...!

169
00:08:48,328 --> 00:08:50,961
As do all from the
House of Phoenix!.

170
00:09:00,895 --> 00:09:01,861
No way!

171
00:09:01,895 --> 00:09:04,361
How many Sacred Gears
do you actually have?

172
00:09:04,395 --> 00:09:06,761
Oh, no, it's not that
I have multiple Sacred Gears,

173
00:09:06,795 --> 00:09:09,595
I simply have the ability
to make them at my will.

174
00:09:09,628 --> 00:09:12,461
I possess Sword Birth,
have you ever heard of it?

175
00:09:12,995 --> 00:09:14,695
In other words...

176
00:09:14,728 --> 00:09:16,461
I make swords...

177
00:09:16,495 --> 00:09:18,428
Magical swords.

178
00:09:19,761 --> 00:09:20,995
Impossible.

179
00:09:21,028 --> 00:09:22,595
That is freakin' tight...

180
00:09:22,628 --> 00:09:25,295
I had no idea he had
that kind of power.

181
00:09:25,895 --> 00:09:27,261
Moron!

182
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:29,895
Never turn away during a fight!

183
00:09:32,495 --> 00:09:34,861
Damn... it should
be any second now.

184
00:09:34,895 --> 00:09:35,895
Boost!

185
00:09:35,928 --> 00:09:38,261
Finally!

186
00:09:38,295 --> 00:09:40,428
Explosion!

187
00:09:40,461 --> 00:09:41,761
Un-Dragon-Wavy...

188
00:09:41,795 --> 00:09:43,595
Dragon Shot!

189
00:09:48,495 --> 00:09:50,461
'Kay, that was crazy.

190
00:09:52,028 --> 00:09:55,328
And I thought I'd held back
a lot of power on it, too.

191
00:09:56,028 --> 00:09:57,961
I can't afford for
him to boost again...

192
00:09:57,995 --> 00:10:00,761
I've gotta take out
his Gear... now!

193
00:10:00,795 --> 00:10:01,861
Gotcha!

194
00:10:03,628 --> 00:10:05,261
Oh, was that supposed to hurt ?

195
00:10:05,295 --> 00:10:06,695
Fly apart!

196
00:10:06,728 --> 00:10:09,395
Dress break!

197
00:10:09,428 --> 00:10:10,961
What did you do?

198
00:10:11,828 --> 00:10:14,461
Save to mental folder, gazonga.

199
00:10:14,495 --> 00:10:16,561
Ooh, saving complete...!

200
00:10:16,595 --> 00:10:18,428
Here, have some more!

201
00:10:25,261 --> 00:10:26,128
Isabela!

202
00:10:26,161 --> 00:10:29,295
One of Lord Riser's
rooks... retired.

203
00:10:30,461 --> 00:10:31,661
I beat her!

204
00:10:31,695 --> 00:10:33,995
What an atrocious
technique, though.

205
00:10:34,028 --> 00:10:37,228
Wow... That's perversion
at its basest level.

206
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:39,495
This is the first time
I've witnessed it myself...

207
00:10:39,528 --> 00:10:41,361
I really don't
know what to say...

208
00:10:41,395 --> 00:10:43,695
I'm sorry my friend
Issei is such a pig.

209
00:10:43,728 --> 00:10:45,361
Hey! Why are you
apologizing to her?

210
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:46,595
She's one of the bad guys!

211
00:10:46,628 --> 00:10:47,395
Kiba!!!

212
00:10:47,428 --> 00:10:47,961
Yeah, but...

213
00:10:47,995 --> 00:10:49,495
You there, foot soldier!

214
00:10:49,528 --> 00:10:50,495
Just a heads up.

215
00:10:50,528 --> 00:10:52,461
You may want to watch this.

216
00:10:54,261 --> 00:10:55,761
Rias!

217
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:14,121
Is that Riser up there with her?

218
00:11:14,155 --> 00:11:15,955
What the hell??

219
00:11:15,988 --> 00:11:18,288
I bet he anticipated our move.

220
00:11:18,321 --> 00:11:19,188
So, I'm assuming you knew

221
00:11:19,221 --> 00:11:22,021
I was planning to
attack you directly?

222
00:11:22,055 --> 00:11:23,788
A virgin should never
underestimate one

223
00:11:23,821 --> 00:11:25,888
with this much experience.

224
00:11:25,921 --> 00:11:28,988
How comforting;
you're as vulgar as ever.

225
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:30,255
The Princess of Ruin...

226
00:11:30,288 --> 00:11:33,221
Twilight Healing...

227
00:11:33,255 --> 00:11:35,088
Priestess of Thunder...

228
00:11:35,121 --> 00:11:36,721
Sword Birth...

229
00:11:36,755 --> 00:11:38,288
And Boosted Gear...

230
00:11:38,321 --> 00:11:41,288
Such grand sounding names
when they're all together.

231
00:11:41,321 --> 00:11:43,188
However, we are Phoenixes...

232
00:11:43,221 --> 00:11:46,421
Immortal Birds... and
you cannot defeat us!

233
00:11:48,488 --> 00:11:50,221
Are you beginning
to understand...?

234
00:11:50,255 --> 00:11:52,155
Your situation here
is so completely

235
00:11:52,188 --> 00:11:53,921
and pathetically hopeless...

236
00:11:53,955 --> 00:11:54,421
Oh Ni?

237
00:11:54,455 --> 00:11:56,055
And Li?

238
00:11:56,088 --> 00:11:57,788
It's time he met
a couple of pawns

239
00:11:57,821 --> 00:12:00,055
who actually know
what they're doing.

240
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:02,455
Boosted Gear!

241
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:05,121
Boost!

242
00:12:05,155 --> 00:12:05,988
You're like so gross.

243
00:12:06,021 --> 00:12:08,088
What kind of freak
attacks like that?

244
00:12:08,121 --> 00:12:10,388
Here, maybe
this'll help you think!

245
00:12:14,321 --> 00:12:16,221
Go ahead and get him, Siris!

246
00:12:19,455 --> 00:12:20,288
Hey, Kiba!

247
00:12:20,321 --> 00:12:21,655
You can do this!

248
00:12:26,088 --> 00:12:27,255
He's so strong!

249
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:30,155
I wish you would make this
a little more entertaining...

250
00:12:30,188 --> 00:12:33,055
This is the worst
foreplay I've ever had.

251
00:12:33,088 --> 00:12:34,788
Play with this!

252
00:12:36,455 --> 00:12:37,388
Rias, no!

253
00:12:37,421 --> 00:12:38,488
I'm fine, Issei.

254
00:12:38,521 --> 00:12:41,121
Don't worry about me;
focus on the battle at hand.

255
00:12:41,155 --> 00:12:42,088
But!

256
00:12:42,121 --> 00:12:43,921
Don't doubt yourself;
I believe in you...

257
00:12:43,955 --> 00:12:45,421
Fight!

258
00:12:45,455 --> 00:12:48,021
Introduce them to the
power you truly possess!

259
00:12:48,055 --> 00:12:51,388
You are a servant
of Rias Gremory!

260
00:12:51,421 --> 00:12:52,455
That's right!

261
00:12:52,488 --> 00:12:54,821
I'm her servant, and
I'm not gonna let her down!

262
00:12:55,455 --> 00:12:56,855
He blocked Siris' sword!

263
00:12:56,888 --> 00:12:57,788
With his arm!

264
00:12:57,821 --> 00:12:59,055
You're damn right I did...!

265
00:12:59,088 --> 00:13:00,188
It's a matter of time,

266
00:13:00,221 --> 00:13:02,955
so get ready because I'm
taking you all out, one by one!

267
00:13:02,988 --> 00:13:05,288
For Rias Gremory!

268
00:13:05,321 --> 00:13:07,221
It broke!

269
00:13:07,255 --> 00:13:08,255
Red Dragon Emperor,

270
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:09,055
if you can hear me at all,

271
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:11,788
respond by lending
me your power!

272
00:13:11,821 --> 00:13:13,421
Dragon Booster!

273
00:13:13,455 --> 00:13:14,421
I need more!.

274
00:13:14,455 --> 00:13:16,888
I ask you to fully
connect with my emotions!

275
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:19,921
Boosted... Gear!

276
00:13:19,955 --> 00:13:23,055
Dragon Booster,
Second Liberation!

277
00:13:25,755 --> 00:13:27,255
What?!

278
00:13:32,288 --> 00:13:33,121
Whoa...!

279
00:13:33,155 --> 00:13:34,921
It changed again!

280
00:13:38,021 --> 00:13:41,188
I didn't expect the Priestess
of Thunder to be this strong.

281
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:44,255
Your magic must
be almost depleted.

282
00:13:44,288 --> 00:13:45,721
Never fear...

283
00:13:46,921 --> 00:13:49,855
All I need is a little rest,
and I'll recover just fine.

284
00:13:49,888 --> 00:13:51,888
Well... That does
sound like a good plan,

285
00:13:51,921 --> 00:13:53,888
but I don't think
I want to wait.

286
00:13:53,921 --> 00:13:55,821
And what's in that?

287
00:13:56,721 --> 00:13:58,355
Oh just your trap.

288
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:00,188
I did it...

289
00:14:00,221 --> 00:14:01,921
I reached a new level...

290
00:14:01,955 --> 00:14:03,821
I can feel more power!

291
00:14:06,421 --> 00:14:07,521
Kiba!

292
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:10,021
Unleash your Sacred Gear
with all the power you've got!

293
00:14:10,055 --> 00:14:10,888
Do what?

294
00:14:10,921 --> 00:14:12,188
Just do it!

295
00:14:14,121 --> 00:14:14,821
Right...

296
00:14:14,855 --> 00:14:16,755
Sword Birth!

297
00:14:24,855 --> 00:14:26,855
Transfer!

298
00:14:43,755 --> 00:14:45,088
I don't understand...

299
00:14:45,121 --> 00:14:47,055
How could we lose?

300
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:50,421
Two of Lord Riser's Pawns...

301
00:14:50,455 --> 00:14:51,855
Two of his Knights...

302
00:14:51,888 --> 00:14:54,188
And one of his
Bishops... retired.

303
00:14:54,221 --> 00:14:57,055
Somehow he enhanced the knight's
ability with his Boosted Gear.

304
00:14:57,088 --> 00:15:00,421
A new power, granted to him
by the Red Dragon Emperor.

305
00:15:00,455 --> 00:15:02,355
That was so awesome...!

306
00:15:02,388 --> 00:15:04,788
Boosted Gear Gift!

307
00:15:09,788 --> 00:15:10,755
Lady Rias...

308
00:15:10,788 --> 00:15:11,988
One Queen...

309
00:15:12,021 --> 00:15:13,955
Retired.

310
00:15:16,855 --> 00:15:20,855
Akeno, no.

311
00:15:20,888 --> 00:15:22,788
Akeno...

312
00:15:23,288 --> 00:15:24,988
How did they get to her?

313
00:15:25,021 --> 00:15:28,088
Looks like you've lost
your vaunted right hand.

314
00:15:28,121 --> 00:15:30,721
Maybe, but I still
have Issei and Kiba!

315
00:15:30,755 --> 00:15:32,888
Not for long, my beloved.

316
00:15:32,921 --> 00:15:33,855
Damn...

317
00:15:33,888 --> 00:15:36,655
Akeno's the most
powerful evil piece we had.

318
00:15:37,488 --> 00:15:40,255
Kiba! Kiba!!!

319
00:15:44,455 --> 00:15:45,888
Give up?

320
00:15:45,921 --> 00:15:47,288
Never!

321
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:49,821
One of Lady Rias'
knights... retired.

322
00:15:49,855 --> 00:15:51,021
Kiba's gone now?

323
00:15:51,055 --> 00:15:53,255
You might as
well resign, darling.

324
00:15:53,288 --> 00:15:55,355
Resign, this!

325
00:15:58,221 --> 00:16:00,188
You don't get it yet, do you?

326
00:16:00,221 --> 00:16:02,421
What a lovely bishop you have...

327
00:16:02,455 --> 00:16:04,021
Refuse to resign and she

328
00:16:04,055 --> 00:16:06,721
and your precious
pawn will only get hurt.

329
00:16:08,021 --> 00:16:09,921
What're you gonna do?

330
00:16:09,955 --> 00:16:12,221
That took you long
enough, Yubelluna.

331
00:16:12,255 --> 00:16:15,221
Their queen was every bit as
strong as we heard she was...

332
00:16:15,255 --> 00:16:17,988
Believe it or not, I had to use
these on her in order to win.

333
00:16:18,021 --> 00:16:19,821
A win is a win, as they say...

334
00:16:19,855 --> 00:16:20,821
Out of all our pieces,

335
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:23,121
you're still the one we
can depend on the most.

336
00:16:23,155 --> 00:16:24,021
Thank you.

337
00:16:24,055 --> 00:16:24,721
What is that?

338
00:16:24,755 --> 00:16:26,255
Our family's hidden treasure...

339
00:16:26,288 --> 00:16:27,788
Tears of the Phoenix...

340
00:16:27,821 --> 00:16:30,821
which completely heal
any injury instantly.

341
00:16:30,855 --> 00:16:32,055
And how is that fair?

342
00:16:32,088 --> 00:16:33,055
Oh, take a chillaxative,

343
00:16:33,088 --> 00:16:35,388
we're only allowed to
use them twice per game.

344
00:16:35,421 --> 00:16:37,021
Besides, you guys have a Bishop

345
00:16:37,055 --> 00:16:40,221
who uses Twilight Healing,
so what're you whining about?

346
00:16:41,921 --> 00:16:44,388
Luckily, these drops can
only be produced by our family,

347
00:16:44,421 --> 00:16:46,955
so we've made quite a
profit off them over the years.

348
00:16:46,988 --> 00:16:48,888
Face it, with our money, tears,

349
00:16:48,921 --> 00:16:51,021
and immortality the House
of Phoenix was destined

350
00:16:51,055 --> 00:16:53,421
to win every Rating
Game we compete in.

351
00:16:55,088 --> 00:16:58,021
Um, I was in the
middle of laughing at you!

352
00:17:00,088 --> 00:17:02,088
Might as well try...

353
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:04,921
Promotion give me
the power of a queen.

354
00:17:08,155 --> 00:17:09,188
Just a little further...

355
00:17:09,221 --> 00:17:10,188
If it's the last thing I do,

356
00:17:10,221 --> 00:17:15,088
I swear I'm gonna make
sure Rias Gremory wins!

357
00:17:16,121 --> 00:17:17,221
Lady Rias!.

358
00:17:17,255 --> 00:17:18,288
Issei Hyodo...

359
00:17:18,321 --> 00:17:20,288
Reporting for butt kicking duty!

360
00:17:20,321 --> 00:17:21,121
Issei!

361
00:17:21,155 --> 00:17:22,888
You're okay!

362
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:27,407
I can take care of pawn boy
and the good bishop...

363
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,107
Shall I?

364
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:29,207
Do not...

365
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,507
Riser would prefer to
take them all on together...

366
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:34,374
I enjoy being as
persuasive as possible.

367
00:17:34,407 --> 00:17:35,474
Don't get ahead of yourself...

368
00:17:35,507 --> 00:17:38,340
You'll have to go through me
before you get to them!

369
00:17:41,974 --> 00:17:44,040
Resign; you're
about to be mated...

370
00:17:44,074 --> 00:17:46,307
I can't help but
anticipate your moves...

371
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:48,407
Riser knows you better
than you think he does...

372
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,240
Checkmate, my love.

373
00:17:50,274 --> 00:17:52,374
You know nothing if
you think I'll give up...!

374
00:17:52,407 --> 00:17:55,240
Try as you might,
you will not intimidate me.

375
00:17:55,274 --> 00:17:57,607
I am a king, and
I am ready for war!

376
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,974
You leave me no choice, then...

377
00:18:00,007 --> 00:18:00,574
Do it.

378
00:18:00,607 --> 00:18:03,007
Gladly, sir.

379
00:18:04,007 --> 00:18:05,007
Asia, hey!

380
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,174
I can't believe

381
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:08,140
you're still standing after
everything they've done...

382
00:18:08,174 --> 00:18:11,007
You're so brave, Issei,
you never give up, do you?

383
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,640
Well, I did promise,
now didn't I?

384
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:13,607
Yeah.

385
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,840
Thank you for that...

386
00:18:14,874 --> 00:18:17,174
You're our lifeline now, so you
need to protect yourself...

387
00:18:17,207 --> 00:18:18,940
better take a step back.

388
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:24,374
No!

389
00:18:24,407 --> 00:18:27,174
Damn you, Riser!

390
00:18:27,207 --> 00:18:28,307
You okay?

391
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,240
I'm good, but...

392
00:18:31,107 --> 00:18:32,340
She's alright...

393
00:18:32,374 --> 00:18:35,307
She most likely just collapsed
from the shock of the attack.

394
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:36,407
I apologize...

395
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:39,107
I didn't expect the boy
to take that attack so well.

396
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:40,540
Perfectly fine...

397
00:18:40,574 --> 00:18:42,040
For now, you've
stopped their Bishop

398
00:18:42,074 --> 00:18:43,974
from any Twilight Healing.

399
00:18:44,007 --> 00:18:44,907
You dick!

400
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,507
He survived a direct
hit from me, though.

401
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:48,607
It's the queen's
defensive strength...

402
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,940
His promotion saved him.

403
00:18:50,974 --> 00:18:51,774
Alright...

404
00:18:51,807 --> 00:18:53,340
Can we start beating
him down now?

405
00:18:53,374 --> 00:18:54,407
Yeah.

406
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,307
I may not know much about
putting someone in check

407
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:58,440
or anticipating
their next move...

408
00:18:58,474 --> 00:19:01,440
But I'm stronger than ever
and I'm not giving up...!

409
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:04,340
As long as I can stand,
I won't stop fighting!

410
00:19:04,374 --> 00:19:06,574
I couldn't have
said it better myself.

411
00:19:07,474 --> 00:19:09,440
Why don't we take
him out together?

412
00:19:09,474 --> 00:19:10,207
Hell yeah!.

413
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,274
I'm in!

414
00:19:12,307 --> 00:19:13,640
Sit tight for me, Asia...

415
00:19:13,674 --> 00:19:15,507
We've got a game to win...

416
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:18,240
After that, I swear we
can go home, okay?

417
00:19:19,307 --> 00:19:20,340
Dragon Boost...

418
00:19:20,374 --> 00:19:21,074
Boost!

419
00:19:21,107 --> 00:19:22,207
One more time!

420
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,240
Let's go!

421
00:19:23,274 --> 00:19:24,274
Boost!

422
00:19:24,307 --> 00:19:25,040
Boost!!

423
00:19:25,074 --> 00:19:25,574
Again!

424
00:19:25,607 --> 00:19:27,574
Dragon Boost!

425
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,507
Burst!

426
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:36,440
Issei!

427
00:19:36,474 --> 00:19:38,374
Unlike any of the
other Sacred Gears,

428
00:19:38,407 --> 00:19:40,107
the Boosted Gear
has a way of taxing

429
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:42,607
its host's physical
strength without warning.

430
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,207
To be honest, I think
the fact that he was able

431
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,074
to fight at all after
enhancing himself

432
00:19:47,107 --> 00:19:50,007
that many times is
practically a miracle.

433
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:52,240
His magical power was
almost completely exhausted

434
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:55,374
by the time he took that
direct hit from Yubelluna.

435
00:19:55,407 --> 00:19:58,207
His body has already
exceeded its limit.

436
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,174
This is over.

437
00:20:00,207 --> 00:20:01,107
Never!

438
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:02,207
Rias...

439
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,574
You barely have any magical
power left, yourself...

440
00:20:04,607 --> 00:20:06,240
Why not admit defeat...?

441
00:20:06,274 --> 00:20:08,440
Riser won't think
any less of you.

442
00:20:08,474 --> 00:20:09,640
Not a chance!

443
00:20:09,674 --> 00:20:10,640
I'm fine!.

444
00:20:10,674 --> 00:20:12,907
I can still fight!

445
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:16,440
I don't care how bad it hurts;
we can still win, I swear!

446
00:20:18,207 --> 00:20:20,374
I'm gonna be
the mightiest pawn...

447
00:20:20,407 --> 00:20:22,007
I promised...

448
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,507
I told you I would...

449
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:26,940
After all, I was
trained by the best.

450
00:20:26,974 --> 00:20:27,607
What?

451
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,307
You don't know when to die!

452
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:31,307
I can fight.

453
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:35,474
A pawn of Rias Gremory
never gives up!

454
00:20:35,507 --> 00:20:37,240
Stop it!

455
00:20:37,274 --> 00:20:38,440
I will fight...

456
00:20:38,474 --> 00:20:40,107
I will keep my promise...

457
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:42,140
Nothing can make me stop...

458
00:20:42,174 --> 00:20:43,907
or back down.

459
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:45,540
Nothing!

460
00:20:45,707 --> 00:20:47,640
Issei, get back...!

461
00:20:47,674 --> 00:20:49,907
Get away from him...!

462
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:52,040
That is a direct order!

463
00:20:52,074 --> 00:20:54,207
You'll see.

464
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:54,907
Because...

465
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:57,574
I won't... ever give up, on her.

466
00:20:58,407 --> 00:20:59,407
Whatever!

467
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,607
I like you and I don't care
what your name is!

468
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,174
I like you for who you are!

469
00:21:02,207 --> 00:21:03,507
Look at everything that
you've done for me...

470
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:06,607
I just hope someday
I can pay you back.

471
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,007
I can't...

472
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,240
It's too much.

473
00:21:09,274 --> 00:21:11,474
Now I'm pissed!

474
00:21:11,507 --> 00:21:14,140
You're just a pathetic,
lowly servant!

475
00:21:14,174 --> 00:21:18,174
You don't even have the right
to challenge Riser Phoenix!

476
00:21:18,207 --> 00:21:19,974
Riser, what do you
think you're doing?

477
00:21:20,007 --> 00:21:23,407
I'm sending this loser to
hell where he belongs.

478
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:27,107
No amount of healing will save
this boy when Riser's done...

479
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:29,040
Any deaths that occur
during a Rating Game

480
00:21:29,074 --> 00:21:32,074
are considered accidents anyway!

481
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:35,307
Bastard.

482
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:36,174
Die!

483
00:21:36,207 --> 00:21:37,307
Issei!

484
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:38,540
Riser, please stop!

485
00:21:38,574 --> 00:21:40,140
Let him go!

486
00:21:47,074 --> 00:21:48,140
I resign, okay?

487
00:21:48,174 --> 00:21:49,340
I resign...

488
00:21:49,374 --> 00:21:51,474
Please, just let him go.

489
00:21:59,407 --> 00:22:01,140
Checkmate...

490
00:22:01,174 --> 00:22:04,040
Riser wins again.

491
00:22:04,074 --> 00:22:05,507
Rias...

492
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:07,607
Why?

493
00:22:08,307 --> 00:22:11,274
Lady Rias' resignation
is recognized.

494
00:22:11,307 --> 00:22:14,540
Lord Riser Phoenix is
the winner of the Game.

495
00:23:49,107 --> 00:23:50,540
This is an engagement party...

496
00:23:50,574 --> 00:23:52,607
So then why the hell am
I in a wedding dress?

497
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,507
I could've worked harder,
but it's too late now.

498
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:56,474
She deserves so
much better than me.

499
00:23:56,507 --> 00:23:57,574
My bride.

500
00:23:57,607 --> 00:24:00,374
Rias Gremory!

501
00:24:00,407 --> 00:24:02,407
Yeah, screw those d-bags.
