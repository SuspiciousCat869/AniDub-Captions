1
00:00:17,233 --> 00:00:18,133
Asia!

2
00:01:51,362 --> 00:01:52,329
Yes!

3
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:54,362
I've been lusting after
this power for years!

4
00:01:54,395 --> 00:01:57,362
Those miserable hearts
are in the palm of my hand...

5
00:01:57,395 --> 00:01:58,695
perfect.

6
00:02:05,362 --> 00:02:06,395
I'll be beloved.

7
00:02:06,429 --> 00:02:09,162
I'll be the most powerful
fallen angel there is!

8
00:02:09,195 --> 00:02:10,895
All those pricks
who screwed me over

9
00:02:10,929 --> 00:02:13,395
are going to regret it!

10
00:02:13,429 --> 00:02:14,495
Oh screw you!

11
00:02:14,529 --> 00:02:15,262
All right, let's go!

12
00:02:15,295 --> 00:02:16,162
You asked for it!

13
00:02:16,195 --> 00:02:16,929
I don't have time for this!

14
00:02:16,962 --> 00:02:19,595
Move it!

15
00:02:26,862 --> 00:02:28,162
No you don't!

16
00:02:29,329 --> 00:02:30,162
Kiba!

17
00:02:30,195 --> 00:02:31,462
And Koneko!

18
00:02:32,662 --> 00:02:34,495
Thank you!

19
00:02:37,362 --> 00:02:38,695
Asia!

20
00:02:47,629 --> 00:02:49,329
Oh no.

21
00:02:49,362 --> 00:02:52,295
You deserve a reward
for making it this far.

22
00:02:56,562 --> 00:02:57,795
I got you!

23
00:02:59,362 --> 00:03:00,329
It's me...

24
00:03:00,362 --> 00:03:02,395
Are you okay?

25
00:03:03,629 --> 00:03:05,895
Issei... you came.

26
00:03:05,929 --> 00:03:09,395
Yeah, and we're not out
yet... so stay with me.

27
00:03:10,362 --> 00:03:12,629
Kay

28
00:03:12,662 --> 00:03:13,795
Go ahead and take the girl.

29
00:03:13,829 --> 00:03:15,795
I got what I needed.

30
00:03:15,829 --> 00:03:16,929
You crazy bitch...!

31
00:03:16,962 --> 00:03:19,529
Put her Sacred Gear back
where you found it, right now!

32
00:03:19,562 --> 00:03:21,595
Soooo tough...

33
00:03:21,629 --> 00:03:22,695
Sorry.

34
00:03:22,729 --> 00:03:25,829
I had to betray my superiors
to snag that little gem.

35
00:03:25,862 --> 00:03:29,395
Unfortunately for you, you're
about to become my dÃ©nouement.

36
00:03:29,429 --> 00:03:30,829
But the good news is...

37
00:03:30,862 --> 00:03:33,229
...you get to die together.

38
00:03:34,195 --> 00:03:35,195
Issei!

39
00:03:35,229 --> 00:03:37,329
'Fraid they've got
the upper hand!

40
00:03:37,362 --> 00:03:38,562
You know I can't believe...

41
00:03:38,595 --> 00:03:40,295
I ever wanted to be with you.

42
00:03:40,329 --> 00:03:43,462
As if I couldn't tell you were a
virgin the first time I saw you.

43
00:03:43,495 --> 00:03:44,662
Made my job easier,

44
00:03:44,695 --> 00:03:46,362
you pansies will
believe anything

45
00:03:46,395 --> 00:03:48,295
if you think you'll
get your pole greased.

46
00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:51,695
I actually liked you... or Yuma.

47
00:03:51,729 --> 00:03:52,229
Sweetie!

48
00:03:52,262 --> 00:03:53,429
That was the point!

49
00:03:53,462 --> 00:03:56,595
I needed you to play super hero
to my damsel in distress.

50
00:03:56,629 --> 00:03:57,829
Poor thing.

51
00:03:57,862 --> 00:04:00,429
You wanted to believe it so
badly you never even caught on.

52
00:04:00,462 --> 00:04:01,695
I wish you could see your face!

53
00:04:01,729 --> 00:04:04,862
It makes the torture of spending
so much time with you worth it!

54
00:04:04,895 --> 00:04:05,795
Why...?

55
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:07,795
Why would you even
let it go that far...?

56
00:04:07,829 --> 00:04:10,729
You had to've known it was
pointless from the start...

57
00:04:10,762 --> 00:04:14,829
why let me worry so much
about that stupid date?

58
00:04:14,862 --> 00:04:15,929
Don't worry...

59
00:04:15,962 --> 00:04:19,329
That date was everything
a girl like me could want...

60
00:04:19,362 --> 00:04:22,862
I was so bored the whole time
I couldn't wait to kill you.

61
00:04:24,462 --> 00:04:26,362
What's wrong with you?

62
00:04:30,862 --> 00:04:32,862
That's gonna get old real fast.

63
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:35,862
And exactly how long do they
intend to hold their shield?

64
00:04:35,895 --> 00:04:37,895
Not a very
well-thought-out tool, is it?

65
00:04:37,929 --> 00:04:39,429
That's gotta be draining.

66
00:04:39,462 --> 00:04:40,495
Tell ya what...

67
00:04:40,529 --> 00:04:42,695
Put those barrier things
down and we'll let you go.

68
00:04:42,729 --> 00:04:44,162
So kidding...

69
00:04:44,195 --> 00:04:46,529
Get comfy 'cause you're
gonna be here awhile.

70
00:04:46,562 --> 00:04:47,795
Man, I bet your minions think

71
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:50,329
you've dropped 'em
like a bad facelift.

72
00:04:50,362 --> 00:04:51,195
Omigod...

73
00:04:51,229 --> 00:04:52,462
Especially that horn-ball

74
00:04:52,495 --> 00:04:54,629
who thought Raynare
wanted his corn nuts...

75
00:04:54,662 --> 00:04:56,629
I bet she's crunched
his ass by now!

76
00:04:56,662 --> 00:04:59,329
If I were you, I wouldn't
underestimate him.

77
00:04:59,362 --> 00:05:00,295
Let's just say...

78
00:05:00,329 --> 00:05:03,562
He's the most powerful
pawn I've ever seen.

79
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:04,395
Yuma.

80
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:06,229
Meaning 'Evening Daze.'

81
00:05:06,262 --> 00:05:10,195
I found it appropriate since my
plan was to kill you at sunset.

82
00:05:10,229 --> 00:05:11,862
Let's talk inappropriate...

83
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:13,429
First you refuse to die,

84
00:05:13,462 --> 00:05:16,395
then you replace me with
some pious, platinum, nun-slut.

85
00:05:16,429 --> 00:05:17,529
Ugh. Issei...

86
00:05:17,562 --> 00:05:18,329
I'm hurt...

87
00:05:18,362 --> 00:05:19,495
Weren't we... special?

88
00:05:19,529 --> 00:05:20,695
You're makin' me jealous.

89
00:05:20,729 --> 00:05:24,162
I bet you took her on one of
your yawn-athon dates, too.

90
00:05:24,529 --> 00:05:26,329
But I guess for a
sheltered little prude,

91
00:05:26,362 --> 00:05:28,195
a night with you is a hoot!

92
00:05:28,229 --> 00:05:30,229
Oh Issei, how do
you expect to get laid

93
00:05:30,262 --> 00:05:32,695
if you keep putting
your victims to sleep?!

94
00:05:33,329 --> 00:05:34,495
Shut up, Raynare!

95
00:05:34,529 --> 00:05:36,429
I love a man who takes control!

96
00:05:36,462 --> 00:05:38,195
Where was this when
we were dating?!

97
00:05:38,229 --> 00:05:39,695
You might've gotten some!

98
00:05:39,729 --> 00:05:43,329
I may be a devil...
but this bitch is just evil!

99
00:05:50,262 --> 00:05:51,595
Kiba!

100
00:05:51,629 --> 00:05:53,362
Koneko?!

101
00:05:54,662 --> 00:05:55,195
We got this!

102
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:56,362
Get out of here, now!

103
00:05:56,395 --> 00:05:57,162
Hurry!

104
00:05:57,195 --> 00:05:58,829
Koneko and I will
keep them here!

105
00:05:58,862 --> 00:06:00,562
Run!

106
00:06:00,595 --> 00:06:01,329
We'll be fine...

107
00:06:01,362 --> 00:06:02,529
I promise!

108
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:03,529
Come on...

109
00:06:03,562 --> 00:06:04,462
Leave already.

110
00:06:04,495 --> 00:06:05,395
I can't.

111
00:06:05,429 --> 00:06:07,162
You standing there
isn't helping anyone.

112
00:06:07,195 --> 00:06:09,629
Go!

113
00:06:09,662 --> 00:06:11,729
Thank you... my friends...

114
00:06:11,762 --> 00:06:13,195
I swear when this is all over

115
00:06:13,229 --> 00:06:15,295
you'll never have
to bail me out again.

116
00:06:15,329 --> 00:06:16,895
I promise you!

117
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:21,862
I'm gonna get stronger...
and fight for myself next time!

118
00:06:21,895 --> 00:06:23,429
A pawn?

119
00:06:23,462 --> 00:06:24,529
Well isn't that nifty,

120
00:06:24,562 --> 00:06:27,162
you nerds name your servants
after chess pieces...?

121
00:06:27,195 --> 00:06:28,095
The pawns are the dopes

122
00:06:28,129 --> 00:06:30,562
who line up in the
front, is that right?

123
00:06:30,595 --> 00:06:33,262
Yeah, they're the
sacrificial players.

124
00:06:33,295 --> 00:06:34,229
Nonsense...

125
00:06:34,262 --> 00:06:36,329
We would never sacrifice
any of our members.

126
00:06:36,362 --> 00:06:38,429
We're family.

127
00:06:43,362 --> 00:06:44,262
Hang in there...

128
00:06:44,295 --> 00:06:45,129
Come on...

129
00:06:45,162 --> 00:06:46,362
Once we get out
of here, you're free.

130
00:06:46,395 --> 00:06:47,595
Stay with me...!

131
00:06:47,629 --> 00:06:49,195
You have to fight!

132
00:06:49,229 --> 00:06:51,195
That's it... be strong!

133
00:06:51,229 --> 00:06:53,762
I know it wasn't a
very long time, but...

134
00:06:53,795 --> 00:06:56,362
I'm so blessed to have
made a friend like you.

135
00:06:56,395 --> 00:06:56,929
Stop!

136
00:06:56,962 --> 00:06:58,162
It isn't over, okay...?

137
00:06:58,195 --> 00:06:59,129
We're going to be friends

138
00:06:59,162 --> 00:07:01,162
for a lot longer than
this; you hear me?!

139
00:07:01,195 --> 00:07:03,295
When you feel better,
we'll go do some karaoke or...

140
00:07:03,329 --> 00:07:05,395
I'll teach you how to bowl...

141
00:07:05,429 --> 00:07:07,895
so you can't give, up, damn it!

142
00:07:07,929 --> 00:07:10,662
You'd be letting my buddies
down, too ya know...

143
00:07:10,695 --> 00:07:11,695
You still have to meet them.

144
00:07:11,729 --> 00:07:12,862
I know they'll love you.

145
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:14,462
They may come off
like a couple of pervs,

146
00:07:14,495 --> 00:07:15,895
but I swear they're
actually great guys

147
00:07:15,929 --> 00:07:18,929
once you warm up to
them--and you will...

148
00:07:18,962 --> 00:07:22,295
Man, are we gonna have a
story to tell them after this!

149
00:07:23,429 --> 00:07:26,495
We'll all need a
crazy night soon, huh...?

150
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:28,629
Where should we go, you think?

151
00:07:28,662 --> 00:07:30,395
I wish it could be different...

152
00:07:30,429 --> 00:07:33,762
It would've been great to
have grown up in this country,

153
00:07:33,795 --> 00:07:35,695
gone to your school.

154
00:07:35,729 --> 00:07:36,895
You still can...

155
00:07:36,929 --> 00:07:40,162
...and school will be a lot
more fun... with you there.

156
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:46,429
I never wanted to make you cry.

157
00:07:46,462 --> 00:07:47,762
Oh, Issei...

158
00:07:47,795 --> 00:07:49,829
I'm... sorry.

159
00:07:50,962 --> 00:07:52,295
Good bye.

160
00:08:01,495 --> 00:08:02,395
No...

161
00:08:02,429 --> 00:08:03,629
Why...?

162
00:08:03,662 --> 00:08:06,862
Why does she have
to be the one to die?

163
00:08:06,895 --> 00:08:07,529
She's a healer.

164
00:08:07,562 --> 00:08:09,695
She could've helped people!

165
00:08:11,195 --> 00:08:12,595
If her gift is to
heal those in need,

166
00:08:12,629 --> 00:08:15,229
doesn't that mean you
have a purpose for her?

167
00:08:15,262 --> 00:08:16,462
It makes no sense...!

168
00:08:16,495 --> 00:08:17,795
Damn you!

169
00:08:18,462 --> 00:08:20,795
Asia didn't do
anything to deserve this!

170
00:08:20,829 --> 00:08:21,829
Please give her back!

171
00:08:21,862 --> 00:08:23,162
Please!

172
00:08:23,195 --> 00:08:25,229
All she wanted was
to make friends!

173
00:08:25,262 --> 00:08:26,062
She had one in me

174
00:08:26,095 --> 00:08:27,929
and would have made
so many more...!

175
00:08:27,962 --> 00:08:29,495
Is that it?

176
00:08:29,529 --> 00:08:31,429
Is this my fault...?

177
00:08:31,462 --> 00:08:35,195
Are you punishing her because
she made friends with a devil?

178
00:08:35,229 --> 00:08:36,262
I'm sorry, okay?!

179
00:08:36,295 --> 00:08:37,795
Just give her back!

180
00:08:37,829 --> 00:08:40,529
A demon asking for
forgiveness in church?

181
00:08:40,929 --> 00:08:42,729
What an insidious
sense of humor.

182
00:08:42,762 --> 00:08:46,195
What are you doing here?!

183
00:08:46,229 --> 00:08:48,795
It doesn't matter what
that moron's abilities are;

184
00:08:48,829 --> 00:08:51,929
he doesn't stand a chance
against Lady Raynare.

185
00:08:51,962 --> 00:08:55,195
Even if she is
his ex-girlfriend!

186
00:08:55,929 --> 00:08:57,829
Oh, we heard all the
tragically lame details

187
00:08:57,862 --> 00:08:59,829
of their little fling!

188
00:09:00,962 --> 00:09:02,329
Now, stop!

189
00:09:02,362 --> 00:09:03,429
Mittelt...!

190
00:09:03,462 --> 00:09:05,429
You're evil!

191
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:07,395
What a joke!

192
00:09:10,229 --> 00:09:13,195
Watch out!

193
00:09:13,229 --> 00:09:14,929
She deflected it!

194
00:09:14,962 --> 00:09:16,662
He's not a joke...

195
00:09:16,695 --> 00:09:19,495
No one laughs at my servants.

196
00:09:20,829 --> 00:09:22,429
Look what you did, now...

197
00:09:22,462 --> 00:09:25,929
Maybe it wasn't such a good
idea to taunt her like that.

198
00:09:25,962 --> 00:09:28,229
Whoopsie on you.

199
00:09:31,595 --> 00:09:33,362
Ugh, how tacky is this?

200
00:09:33,395 --> 00:09:35,862
Some rabid knight did it
to me on the way up here.

201
00:09:35,895 --> 00:09:37,895
Where are Kiba and Koneko?!

202
00:09:39,362 --> 00:09:40,295
Wonderful, huh...?

203
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:42,862
No matter the injury,
I heal instantly...

204
00:09:42,895 --> 00:09:44,795
A perfect gift for those
of us who no longer

205
00:09:44,829 --> 00:09:48,562
have the benefit of divine
protection, wouldn't you say?

206
00:09:48,595 --> 00:09:51,862
And now I'll never risk losing
my rank in the underworld.

207
00:09:51,895 --> 00:09:52,529
Oh...!

208
00:09:52,562 --> 00:09:54,595
Great Azazel and Shemhazai,

209
00:09:54,629 --> 00:09:56,829
I am prepared and
ready to do your works!

210
00:09:56,862 --> 00:09:59,595
What does that matter?

211
00:09:59,629 --> 00:10:01,462
What does that have
to do with Asia...?!

212
00:10:01,495 --> 00:10:02,429
She wasn't a threat.

213
00:10:02,462 --> 00:10:04,229
She didn't care about power!

214
00:10:04,262 --> 00:10:06,195
Unfortunately for those
with the Sacred Gear,

215
00:10:06,229 --> 00:10:08,295
this is their destiny.

216
00:10:08,329 --> 00:10:09,662
That is such bullshit...!

217
00:10:09,695 --> 00:10:10,729
She never would have used it!

218
00:10:10,762 --> 00:10:12,295
She just wanted
to live in peace!

219
00:10:12,329 --> 00:10:13,429
Out of the question.

220
00:10:13,462 --> 00:10:14,129
Why?

221
00:10:14,162 --> 00:10:15,195
Humans don't have the ability

222
00:10:15,229 --> 00:10:17,862
to survive in their world
with the Sacred Gear...

223
00:10:17,895 --> 00:10:20,529
Even if they choose to
use the power for 'good,'

224
00:10:20,562 --> 00:10:23,695
they are seen as different and
would be tortured out of fear.

225
00:10:23,729 --> 00:10:25,229
They said anyone

226
00:10:25,262 --> 00:10:26,762
who had my kind of
power was a heretic,

227
00:10:26,795 --> 00:10:29,195
so I had no choice
but to run away.

228
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:29,995
Honestly...

229
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:32,329
I'd be happy to
have any friends.

230
00:10:32,362 --> 00:10:34,562
Have you ever heard
anything more absurd...?

231
00:10:34,595 --> 00:10:36,629
That's just how humans operate.

232
00:10:36,662 --> 00:10:38,829
Such an unfortunate
waste of power.

233
00:10:38,862 --> 00:10:40,262
That wouldn't have happened...!

234
00:10:40,295 --> 00:10:41,262
I was her friend

235
00:10:41,295 --> 00:10:42,862
and I could have
protected her from all that...!

236
00:10:42,895 --> 00:10:44,729
I wouldn't have let
anyone hurt her--ever!

237
00:10:44,762 --> 00:10:46,362
She's dead!

238
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:47,295
Stone cold dead

239
00:10:47,329 --> 00:10:49,162
and you're whining
about protecting her--

240
00:10:49,195 --> 00:10:51,362
you realize how
psychotic you sound?!

241
00:10:51,395 --> 00:10:52,062
You wouldn't have been able

242
00:10:52,095 --> 00:10:53,895
to save her back then anyway!

243
00:10:53,929 --> 00:10:55,529
And you can't save her now!

244
00:10:55,562 --> 00:10:57,262
Will you shut up?

245
00:10:57,295 --> 00:10:58,762
I'll never forgive
you for this...

246
00:10:58,795 --> 00:11:01,429
I'll never forgive myself.

247
00:11:01,462 --> 00:11:02,929
Why couldn't it have been you?

248
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:05,229
Any Sacred Gear works
in direct correlation

249
00:11:05,262 --> 00:11:07,329
to the current feelings
of its owner...

250
00:11:07,362 --> 00:11:08,529
I want her back!

251
00:11:08,562 --> 00:11:11,762
To put it another way, the
stronger those feelings are...

252
00:11:11,795 --> 00:11:14,295
I want Asia back!

253
00:11:14,329 --> 00:11:16,795
The more powerful your
Sacred Gear will be...

254
00:11:16,829 --> 00:11:19,195
Dragon Boost!

255
00:11:23,529 --> 00:11:25,262
You don't pay attention, do you?

256
00:11:25,295 --> 00:11:26,629
There's nothing
you can do to win--

257
00:11:26,662 --> 00:11:29,262
even if you tripled
the power you have.

258
00:11:32,262 --> 00:11:34,429
And you're still
trying to test me.

259
00:11:53,432 --> 00:11:55,398
Light is toxic to devils.

260
00:11:55,432 --> 00:11:58,132
Just touching it
scorches your bodies.

261
00:11:58,165 --> 00:12:00,232
It's said... to be
the most intense

262
00:12:00,265 --> 00:12:02,865
and worst pain a
devil can endure.

263
00:12:02,898 --> 00:12:04,232
So what do you think?

264
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:05,932
Is it true?

265
00:12:05,965 --> 00:12:08,098
What do I care if it is?

266
00:12:08,132 --> 00:12:09,065
This is nothing...

267
00:12:09,098 --> 00:12:13,065
Nothing compared to
what Asia went through!

268
00:12:14,932 --> 00:12:16,965
I'll put up with
anything for her!

269
00:12:18,398 --> 00:12:20,098
You know I really
am impressed...

270
00:12:20,132 --> 00:12:22,132
A lower class-devil
making it this far?

271
00:12:22,165 --> 00:12:24,765
That power is something
to be reckoned with.

272
00:12:26,398 --> 00:12:27,832
What's happening?

273
00:12:27,865 --> 00:12:30,032
Not that it's gonna do
you any good, though.

274
00:12:30,065 --> 00:12:32,098
I just wanted to make
sure you got your kudos

275
00:12:32,132 --> 00:12:33,965
for doing so much
better than expected

276
00:12:33,998 --> 00:12:36,165
from a devil of your class.

277
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:39,332
That's it.

278
00:12:39,365 --> 00:12:41,465
God isn't going to help me.

279
00:12:41,498 --> 00:12:44,465
I'm a demon now--what
was I thinking...?

280
00:12:44,498 --> 00:12:47,332
I need to call Satan.

281
00:12:47,365 --> 00:12:49,965
I'm a devil now, too,
so what do you say?

282
00:12:49,998 --> 00:12:52,798
Just this once,
I need a little help.

283
00:12:52,832 --> 00:12:54,932
What are you mumbling
about over there...?

284
00:12:54,965 --> 00:12:57,165
Is all the pain driving you mad?

285
00:12:58,798 --> 00:13:00,332
I'm begging you.

286
00:13:00,365 --> 00:13:03,865
I won't ask you for
anything else after this.

287
00:13:03,898 --> 00:13:05,532
What's he doing?

288
00:13:05,565 --> 00:13:08,298
Turn this around on her...

289
00:13:08,332 --> 00:13:10,432
Let me destroy her ass!

290
00:13:10,465 --> 00:13:12,165
How are you able to stand?

291
00:13:12,198 --> 00:13:13,332
This is impossible.

292
00:13:13,365 --> 00:13:15,932
That light should be burning
you from the inside, out!

293
00:13:15,965 --> 00:13:17,398
Tell me how you're doing that.

294
00:13:17,432 --> 00:13:19,098
You don't have the
power to temper light...!

295
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:20,798
You are nothing!

296
00:13:20,832 --> 00:13:23,865
Don't get me wrong...
it doesn't tickle.

297
00:13:23,898 --> 00:13:26,998
Even with this strength I feel
like I'm about to pass out.

298
00:13:27,032 --> 00:13:28,932
But I don't care.

299
00:13:28,965 --> 00:13:33,232
I'll fight through it if it
means I can take you down!

300
00:13:35,432 --> 00:13:37,465
Explosion!

301
00:13:38,832 --> 00:13:41,765
That energy wave is
at least second level.

302
00:13:41,798 --> 00:13:44,498
His Sacred Gear should be
nowhere near this strong...!

303
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:47,365
It's... It's just
a Double Critical!

304
00:13:58,465 --> 00:14:00,132
You won't get away... bitch!

305
00:14:00,165 --> 00:14:02,165
No! I have the supreme power!

306
00:14:02,198 --> 00:14:10,765
This one's for Asia!

307
00:14:10,798 --> 00:14:12,132
That felt good.

308
00:14:13,298 --> 00:14:15,232
Look at you handling
that on your own!

309
00:14:15,265 --> 00:14:16,132
Yeah, thanks...

310
00:14:16,165 --> 00:14:17,432
what held you up?

311
00:14:17,465 --> 00:14:18,832
I was instructed to stay back...

312
00:14:18,865 --> 00:14:21,032
Rias's orders, sorry.

313
00:14:21,065 --> 00:14:22,232
Seriously?

314
00:14:22,265 --> 00:14:23,265
Seriously.

315
00:14:23,298 --> 00:14:24,165
I believe in you.

316
00:14:24,198 --> 00:14:25,532
I knew you would defeat her.

317
00:14:25,565 --> 00:14:26,932
You did?

318
00:14:26,965 --> 00:14:28,065
Once my business was finished,

319
00:14:28,098 --> 00:14:30,298
I found my way to the basement
and arrived just in time

320
00:14:30,332 --> 00:14:32,298
to see Kiba and Koneko
having a free-for-all

321
00:14:32,332 --> 00:14:34,332
with a bevy of fallen angels.

322
00:14:35,132 --> 00:14:37,232
I don't know that we would've
gotten out without you.

323
00:14:37,265 --> 00:14:38,265
Aw man...

324
00:14:38,298 --> 00:14:40,098
I'm sorry I missed it.

325
00:14:40,565 --> 00:14:42,832
Did someone order this?

326
00:14:45,098 --> 00:14:46,465
You must be Raynare.

327
00:14:46,498 --> 00:14:47,998
Lovely entrance.

328
00:14:49,132 --> 00:14:50,465
I am Rias Gremory...

329
00:14:50,498 --> 00:14:53,265
Also known as the next head
of the House of Gremory.

330
00:14:53,298 --> 00:14:54,165
Gremory...?

331
00:14:54,198 --> 00:14:55,398
You gotta be kidding.

332
00:14:55,432 --> 00:14:57,265
It's wonderful to meet you...

333
00:14:57,298 --> 00:14:59,432
What a shame we don't
have time to chat...

334
00:14:59,465 --> 00:15:01,298
But sadly...

335
00:15:02,198 --> 00:15:05,465
It's time for you to join your
friends I disposed of earlier.

336
00:15:05,498 --> 00:15:07,498
They were rather rude to me.

337
00:15:08,165 --> 00:15:09,532
So you killed them?

338
00:15:09,565 --> 00:15:11,498
Rias's fuse is long,
but when pushed,

339
00:15:11,532 --> 00:15:14,932
she lives up to her title as
Empress of Annihilation.

340
00:15:14,965 --> 00:15:15,998
Damn...

341
00:15:16,032 --> 00:15:17,998
Didn't know I was part of
such a hardcore group...

342
00:15:18,032 --> 00:15:19,132
Neat.

343
00:15:19,165 --> 00:15:20,398
So many feathers!

344
00:15:20,432 --> 00:15:23,198
It looks like the
forest is molting!

345
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:27,798
Why would the heiress of
Gremory dare such a thing?

346
00:15:27,832 --> 00:15:29,965
Well, since you ask...

347
00:15:29,998 --> 00:15:31,865
After Dohnaseek attacked Issei,

348
00:15:31,898 --> 00:15:34,032
I discovered multiple fallen
angels had plans

349
00:15:34,065 --> 00:15:35,398
to attack this town...

350
00:15:35,432 --> 00:15:36,898
Normally, I would
have stayed out of it,

351
00:15:36,932 --> 00:15:39,332
but they seemed insistent
on targeting my team.

352
00:15:39,365 --> 00:15:41,998
So... You did it to defend me?

353
00:15:42,832 --> 00:15:43,498
Look at you...!

354
00:15:43,532 --> 00:15:45,032
I didn't see your Sacred Gear?

355
00:15:45,065 --> 00:15:46,332
Yeah...

356
00:15:46,365 --> 00:15:47,165
I don't know what happened,

357
00:15:47,198 --> 00:15:48,965
it just freaked out
and turned red.

358
00:15:48,998 --> 00:15:50,265
It's called a Red Dragon...

359
00:15:50,298 --> 00:15:52,532
Which... explains
a lot, actually.

360
00:15:52,565 --> 00:15:53,798
Did you see this, Raynare?

361
00:15:53,832 --> 00:15:57,232
You weren't defeated by a Dual
Critical Sacred Gear after all.

362
00:15:57,265 --> 00:15:59,465
No need to feel too embarrassed.

363
00:15:59,498 --> 00:16:00,665
What?

364
00:16:00,698 --> 00:16:03,998
The one Issei uses automatically
doubles its owner's power

365
00:16:04,032 --> 00:16:06,498
every ten seconds--allowing
him to transcend

366
00:16:06,532 --> 00:16:08,532
both God and Satan at will...

367
00:16:08,565 --> 00:16:11,998
It's one of the thirteen
varieties of Longinus.

368
00:16:13,065 --> 00:16:14,865
The strongest level of
the Red Dragon Emperor

369
00:16:14,898 --> 00:16:16,532
is called Boosted Gear!

370
00:16:16,565 --> 00:16:18,365
So this sacred tool
with the ability

371
00:16:18,398 --> 00:16:21,865
to destroy God is in
the hands of a child?

372
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:24,298
The one downfall is that it
requires a decent amount

373
00:16:24,332 --> 00:16:26,865
of time to start due to
it's immense power...

374
00:16:26,898 --> 00:16:27,865
The only reason he was able

375
00:16:27,898 --> 00:16:30,532
to beat you was because
you let your guard down.

376
00:16:30,565 --> 00:16:32,798
If only you'd learned
that lesson earlier.

377
00:16:32,832 --> 00:16:34,832
Issei, please...

378
00:16:35,932 --> 00:16:37,998
I'm sorry, I know I said
some mean things to you

379
00:16:38,032 --> 00:16:39,165
but I didn't have a choice--

380
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:41,932
I had to fulfill my role
as a fallen angel!

381
00:16:41,965 --> 00:16:42,865
Yuma!

382
00:16:42,898 --> 00:16:43,832
I mean...

383
00:16:43,865 --> 00:16:44,632
If I really didn't care...

384
00:16:44,665 --> 00:16:47,832
would I still be
wearing your gift?

385
00:16:47,865 --> 00:16:49,132
Please don't tell
me you forgot...

386
00:16:49,165 --> 00:16:51,998
You bought it for me,
don't you remember?

387
00:16:52,032 --> 00:16:52,965
No way.

388
00:16:52,998 --> 00:16:55,432
Why do you still
have that thing?

389
00:16:56,998 --> 00:16:59,732
How could I possibly
get rid of this?

390
00:17:00,232 --> 00:17:02,465
It reminds me of you.

391
00:17:03,432 --> 00:17:04,132
Koneko...

392
00:17:04,165 --> 00:17:05,498
You ready?

393
00:17:09,098 --> 00:17:12,065
You wouldn't let them hurt me...
would you, Issei?

394
00:17:12,098 --> 00:17:13,398
Shut up...

395
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:15,065
I don't buy it.

396
00:17:15,865 --> 00:17:17,765
Rias. Please...

397
00:17:17,798 --> 00:17:19,265
I can't do this.

398
00:17:22,865 --> 00:17:24,298
You've toyed with
my servant's emotions

399
00:17:24,332 --> 00:17:25,898
for the last time.

400
00:17:25,932 --> 00:17:27,165
Be gone!

401
00:17:32,798 --> 00:17:34,098
Uh... In that case...

402
00:17:34,132 --> 00:17:35,398
Since you're single...

403
00:17:35,432 --> 00:17:38,198
Do you think you'd
like to go out with me?

404
00:17:38,232 --> 00:17:40,865
I'd like for you
to be my boyfriend!

405
00:17:52,465 --> 00:17:53,432
These are beautiful.

406
00:17:53,465 --> 00:17:55,065
Shall we return them?

407
00:17:58,165 --> 00:17:59,465
Yeah.

408
00:18:06,265 --> 00:18:07,398
I'm sorry...

409
00:18:07,432 --> 00:18:09,898
You all came to help me...

410
00:18:09,932 --> 00:18:13,532
I fought as hard as
I could and still...

411
00:18:13,565 --> 00:18:15,532
I failed...

412
00:18:15,565 --> 00:18:17,365
She's gone...

413
00:18:17,398 --> 00:18:20,032
Asia, please forgive me.

414
00:18:20,898 --> 00:18:23,465
You have nothing
to apologize for.

415
00:18:23,498 --> 00:18:25,465
This world is still new to you.

416
00:18:25,498 --> 00:18:27,832
Nobody here is placing blame,

417
00:18:27,865 --> 00:18:29,765
least of all, Asia.

418
00:18:29,798 --> 00:18:32,798
But... But... I...

419
00:18:32,832 --> 00:18:34,532
Now, this may not
make any sense,

420
00:18:34,565 --> 00:18:36,798
but I'd like to show
you something.

421
00:18:37,298 --> 00:18:39,398
Have you ever seen
one of these before?

422
00:18:39,432 --> 00:18:41,298
A chess piece.

423
00:18:41,332 --> 00:18:42,198
Uh huh.

424
00:18:42,232 --> 00:18:43,065
That one...

425
00:18:43,098 --> 00:18:44,332
is called the bishop.

426
00:18:44,365 --> 00:18:46,365
What does that mean?

427
00:18:46,398 --> 00:18:48,332
The bishop's position
of power is to protect

428
00:18:48,365 --> 00:18:50,798
and heal the other devils
in the household.

429
00:18:50,832 --> 00:18:52,798
Perhaps the timing is perfect.

430
00:18:52,832 --> 00:18:54,232
We could use a good clergyman.

431
00:18:54,265 --> 00:18:56,132
Wait... are you saying...?

432
00:18:57,232 --> 00:19:02,032
Our good Sister is about to be
born again into the underworld.

433
00:19:02,065 --> 00:19:05,332
In the name of Rias Gremory
I call to Asia Argento...

434
00:19:05,365 --> 00:19:07,998
Hear my command.

435
00:19:08,032 --> 00:19:09,865
Return thy soul from
the shadows of death

436
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:11,165
to the human realm...

437
00:19:11,198 --> 00:19:13,932
Rise once more as
my demon servant.

438
00:19:13,965 --> 00:19:14,732
Rejoice!

439
00:19:14,765 --> 00:19:16,832
For you have been
given new life!

440
00:19:16,865 --> 00:19:19,765
Wake as my healer and clergyman!

441
00:19:21,832 --> 00:19:22,465
So what now...?

442
00:19:22,498 --> 00:19:23,965
Is she gonna wake up?

443
00:19:23,998 --> 00:19:25,498
Just wait.

444
00:19:32,132 --> 00:19:33,198
You're alive!

445
00:19:33,232 --> 00:19:33,898
Huh?

446
00:19:33,932 --> 00:19:34,432
Wait...

447
00:19:34,465 --> 00:19:35,465
is that...

448
00:19:35,498 --> 00:19:36,765
really her?

449
00:19:36,798 --> 00:19:37,732
It is.

450
00:19:37,765 --> 00:19:39,798
I don't make a habit
of reviving the deceased

451
00:19:39,832 --> 00:19:42,232
but her power may be useful...

452
00:19:42,265 --> 00:19:44,298
From here on,
you are her protector...

453
00:19:44,332 --> 00:19:47,232
You are the
senior devil, after all.

454
00:19:47,498 --> 00:19:48,398
Issei...?

455
00:19:48,432 --> 00:19:51,332
Uh... Am... Am I here?

456
00:19:52,498 --> 00:19:54,398
Yes, and I'm so happy...!

457
00:19:54,432 --> 00:19:56,065
You're home.

458
00:20:03,751 --> 00:20:06,051
You are so damn sexy
in the morning...

459
00:20:06,084 --> 00:20:08,117
What do I do to get
you up... huh?

460
00:20:08,151 --> 00:20:08,917
Hit it.

461
00:20:08,951 --> 00:20:10,684
Hit it hard.

462
00:20:11,484 --> 00:20:12,251
What's up?

463
00:20:12,284 --> 00:20:13,851
It's your favorite
devil servant!

464
00:20:13,884 --> 00:20:14,551
Hi!

465
00:20:14,584 --> 00:20:15,817
I'm surprised you're here today.

466
00:20:15,851 --> 00:20:16,917
How you feeling?

467
00:20:16,951 --> 00:20:18,017
Great!

468
00:20:18,051 --> 00:20:19,151
Thanks to Asia's power,
it's like it never happened.

469
00:20:19,184 --> 00:20:22,451
Fantastic, she's already
proving how useful she can be.

470
00:20:22,484 --> 00:20:23,817
It's no wonder all
those fallen angels

471
00:20:23,851 --> 00:20:25,551
were so threatened by her power.

472
00:20:25,584 --> 00:20:26,617
So, question.

473
00:20:26,651 --> 00:20:27,517
If you don't mind...

474
00:20:27,551 --> 00:20:29,417
If... we're named
after chess pieces,

475
00:20:29,451 --> 00:20:31,584
does that mean all the
positions are represented?

476
00:20:31,617 --> 00:20:33,151
It does.

477
00:20:33,184 --> 00:20:34,551
Then if I'm a pawn,

478
00:20:34,584 --> 00:20:35,617
that would mean that you have

479
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:38,151
or can have like, seven
more of me on your board?

480
00:20:38,184 --> 00:20:39,084
Which is totally cool.

481
00:20:39,117 --> 00:20:42,451
I understand if I'm
not enough for you.

482
00:20:42,484 --> 00:20:43,251
That was a joke!

483
00:20:43,284 --> 00:20:45,417
I'm completely
stable and secure!

484
00:20:46,451 --> 00:20:49,084
You're the only pawn
I'll ever need, Issei.

485
00:20:49,117 --> 00:20:50,017
That's awesome.

486
00:20:50,051 --> 00:20:51,784
When a human becomes a devil,

487
00:20:51,817 --> 00:20:54,417
the number of Evil Pieces
they consume varies.

488
00:20:54,451 --> 00:20:55,884
It just depends on
what special abilities

489
00:20:55,917 --> 00:20:58,984
that person has to contribute.

490
00:20:59,017 --> 00:21:00,084
Consumed?

491
00:21:00,117 --> 00:21:01,851
For you, the pieces
I had remaining,

492
00:21:01,884 --> 00:21:05,784
were one knight, one rook,
one bishop, and eight pawns...

493
00:21:05,817 --> 00:21:07,951
So that is what
I had to choose from...

494
00:21:07,984 --> 00:21:10,651
After I knew I wanted to
bring you back as my servant...

495
00:21:10,684 --> 00:21:13,851
I decided to use all eight of
my pawns in order to save you.

496
00:21:13,884 --> 00:21:15,151
So...

497
00:21:15,184 --> 00:21:17,484
You sacrificed seven
others to have me?

498
00:21:17,517 --> 00:21:18,584
It was a gamble...

499
00:21:18,617 --> 00:21:20,417
I had a feeling your power alone

500
00:21:20,451 --> 00:21:22,951
was strong enough to replace
every one of the others.

501
00:21:22,984 --> 00:21:24,884
Humans with that
potential are hard to find

502
00:21:24,917 --> 00:21:29,017
so I considered the sacrifice
to be well worth the risk.

503
00:21:29,051 --> 00:21:30,151
Now that we know you posses

504
00:21:30,184 --> 00:21:33,551
the Boosted Gear of Longinus,
I'd say it was worth it.

505
00:21:33,584 --> 00:21:34,951
You are worth it.

506
00:21:34,984 --> 00:21:35,917
Boosted Gear...

507
00:21:35,951 --> 00:21:39,017
The highest level of the
Red Dragon Emperor.

508
00:21:39,051 --> 00:21:40,917
The crimson haired
Princess of Ruin

509
00:21:40,951 --> 00:21:43,551
and the user of
the Red Dragon...

510
00:21:43,584 --> 00:21:46,151
I don't know if we could
be more perfectly matched.

511
00:21:46,184 --> 00:21:46,584
Yeah...

512
00:21:46,617 --> 00:21:47,917
Go, Team Red!

513
00:21:47,951 --> 00:21:49,984
Strive to become
the mightiest pawn...

514
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:52,851
I have complete faith in
your ability to achieve this...

515
00:21:52,884 --> 00:21:55,084
Consider it an order,
my dear servant.

516
00:21:55,117 --> 00:21:56,884
I can totally do that!

517
00:21:56,917 --> 00:21:59,017
And now I'm closer to my goal!

518
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:01,651
Oh wow, what are you doing?!

519
00:22:05,751 --> 00:22:07,784
Just a little spell to
strengthen your stamina.

520
00:22:07,817 --> 00:22:08,651
Sweetness...!

521
00:22:08,684 --> 00:22:10,717
I've always wanted
porn star stamina!

522
00:22:10,751 --> 00:22:12,717
You'll need your strength
to better fulfill my orders,

523
00:22:12,751 --> 00:22:14,717
and I'm going to have
to stop coddling you

524
00:22:14,751 --> 00:22:16,817
or our newest member
will become jealous.

525
00:22:16,851 --> 00:22:17,684
Jealous?

526
00:22:17,717 --> 00:22:18,417
Um...

527
00:22:18,451 --> 00:22:19,651
What's going on?

528
00:22:19,684 --> 00:22:21,117
We're just talking!

529
00:22:21,151 --> 00:22:22,817
That's how it always starts.

530
00:22:22,851 --> 00:22:23,517
It's okay.

531
00:22:23,551 --> 00:22:24,417
I know she's prettier than me.

532
00:22:24,451 --> 00:22:26,617
And she'll probably
do things I won't,

533
00:22:26,651 --> 00:22:28,117
so it makes sense
that you like her more...

534
00:22:28,151 --> 00:22:28,917
Oh!

535
00:22:28,951 --> 00:22:29,484
I shouldn't say
things like that!

536
00:22:29,517 --> 00:22:29,984
I swear I'm not jealous!

537
00:22:30,017 --> 00:22:31,117
I'm just insecure!

538
00:22:31,151 --> 00:22:35,817
Dear Lord, please forgive
my sins of lust and envy--

539
00:22:35,851 --> 00:22:37,517
Asia! Are you okay?!

540
00:22:37,551 --> 00:22:39,517
I feel like a knife just
ran through my head.

541
00:22:39,551 --> 00:22:41,984
God's not very receptive
to the prayers of demons.

542
00:22:42,017 --> 00:22:43,517
I forgot.

543
00:22:43,551 --> 00:22:46,584
He's probably angry that
I became a devil, huh?

544
00:22:46,617 --> 00:22:48,884
How do you feel about it?

545
00:22:48,917 --> 00:22:49,584
Oh me?

546
00:22:49,617 --> 00:22:50,851
I don't have any regrets at all!

547
00:22:50,884 --> 00:22:54,117
The best part is that Issei and
I can be together forever now,

548
00:22:54,151 --> 00:22:56,451
and that's all
I ever really wanted.

549
00:22:56,484 --> 00:22:57,317
Uh huh, that's nice,

550
00:22:57,351 --> 00:22:58,884
now about that
outfit you've got on.

551
00:22:58,917 --> 00:23:01,117
What do you think?

552
00:23:01,151 --> 00:23:01,917
It's great, but...

553
00:23:01,951 --> 00:23:04,051
does it mean you
go to our school?

554
00:23:04,084 --> 00:23:05,251
It does.

555
00:23:05,284 --> 00:23:06,851
My father is on the school
board so getting her enrolled

556
00:23:06,884 --> 00:23:08,851
as a transfer student
wasn't a problem.

557
00:23:08,884 --> 00:23:09,817
That's cool.

558
00:23:09,851 --> 00:23:10,951
I didn't know that.

559
00:23:11,984 --> 00:23:12,851
Good morning, everyone!

560
00:23:12,884 --> 00:23:15,751
I'm almost glad to
see you're not dead.

561
00:23:17,084 --> 00:23:17,751
Oh perfect!

562
00:23:17,784 --> 00:23:18,651
You're all here!

563
00:23:18,684 --> 00:23:19,651
I brought cake

564
00:23:19,684 --> 00:23:22,417
so we could officially
welcome our new member!

565
00:23:23,484 --> 00:23:24,517
Issei?

566
00:23:24,551 --> 00:23:26,017
Yeah?

567
00:23:26,051 --> 00:23:26,884
Great job today.

568
00:23:26,917 --> 00:23:28,817
I was very impressed.

569
00:23:28,851 --> 00:23:29,517
Oh...

570
00:23:29,551 --> 00:23:31,551
Thanks for your impressed-ness.

571
00:23:35,551 --> 00:23:38,017
Wasn't that a sweet ending?

572
00:23:38,051 --> 00:23:39,584
Gag me.

573
00:23:52,484 --> 00:23:52,984
Oh snap...

574
00:23:53,017 --> 00:23:54,351
Nipple contact.

575
00:23:56,084 --> 00:23:57,751
Look here, Tiny Tim,
Miltan wants you

576
00:23:57,784 --> 00:23:59,817
to turn her into a
magical fairy princess!

577
00:23:59,851 --> 00:24:02,517
Did ya see anything
you like, you big pervert?
