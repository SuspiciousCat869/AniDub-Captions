1
00:00:17,266 --> 00:00:18,600
What's up, you guys?

2
00:00:22,566 --> 00:00:23,233
Whoa...

3
00:00:23,266 --> 00:00:25,166
Dude, this is totally a bra...!

4
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,733
But what's it doing in here?

5
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,600
I'm totally holding
a titty hammock!

6
00:00:38,766 --> 00:00:41,133
Did ya see anything
you like, you big pervert?

7
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:42,700
It's not what it looks like.

8
00:00:43,333 --> 00:00:45,200
Hey... is that my bra?

9
00:00:45,233 --> 00:00:48,300
I think he's gonna put
it on and wear it around.

10
00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:49,566
Oh, please don't!

11
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,533
It's not like that!

12
00:00:50,566 --> 00:00:53,433
It just happened to
get caught on my face!

13
00:00:53,466 --> 00:00:54,600
I'm so sorry...

14
00:00:54,633 --> 00:00:56,166
I know I'm a visitor here;

15
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,666
I really hate being in the way.

16
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:58,933
No, it's fine.

17
00:00:58,966 --> 00:01:01,733
As a matter of fact, having you
around definitely has its perks.

18
00:01:01,766 --> 00:01:03,266
Well, it won't be
for much longer;

19
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,500
the President said
she'd find me a place

20
00:01:04,533 --> 00:01:06,766
to stay before
she went to school.

21
00:01:08,233 --> 00:01:09,400
Early morning training?

22
00:01:09,433 --> 00:01:12,100
Your fight with the fallen
angels made one thing clear...

23
00:01:12,133 --> 00:01:13,233
We need to get you worked up

24
00:01:13,266 --> 00:01:14,533
to your peak physical condition,

25
00:01:14,566 --> 00:01:16,133
as soon as we possibly can.

26
00:01:16,166 --> 00:01:17,433
Oh. Great.

27
00:01:17,466 --> 00:01:18,700
I'll come pick you
up in the morning.

28
00:01:18,733 --> 00:01:19,733
Five sound good?

29
00:01:19,766 --> 00:01:21,366
No... That's nuts...

30
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,800
I mean that sounds fine.

31
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:24,800
Well... I'm off
to pass out flyers.

32
00:01:24,833 --> 00:01:26,633
Perfect; I'll see ya soon.

33
00:01:28,166 --> 00:01:29,700
So, Asia.

34
00:01:29,733 --> 00:01:30,766
Uh... Yeah?

35
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,766
Let's have a chat about
the sleeping arrangements.

36
00:03:13,195 --> 00:03:17,595
I don't feel well, will
you help me, doctor?.

37
00:03:17,628 --> 00:03:20,162
Don't you wanna
take my temperature?

38
00:03:20,195 --> 00:03:21,928
Give me a shot?

39
00:03:24,762 --> 00:03:28,428
It's 4:30, why in the
hell is my alarm going off?

40
00:03:30,595 --> 00:03:31,528
My workout!

41
00:03:31,562 --> 00:03:33,395
She'll be here any second!

42
00:03:37,128 --> 00:03:39,428
Anyone ever tell you,
you run like a school girl?

43
00:03:39,462 --> 00:03:40,428
Yes, ma'am!

44
00:03:40,462 --> 00:03:42,895
People have been telling
me that my whole life!

45
00:03:44,028 --> 00:03:46,095
I wish that bicycle
seat was my face!

46
00:03:46,128 --> 00:03:47,095
No complaining.

47
00:03:47,128 --> 00:03:48,328
Come on, pick it up,

48
00:03:48,362 --> 00:03:50,962
I know you need some work but
you can do better than that!

49
00:03:50,995 --> 00:03:53,062
I think I'm gonna
puke up my ball sac.

50
00:03:56,428 --> 00:03:56,962
Listen.

51
00:03:56,995 --> 00:03:58,028
In the world of devils,

52
00:03:58,062 --> 00:03:59,928
intelligence doesn't matter
as much as strength.

53
00:03:59,962 --> 00:04:00,562
So...

54
00:04:00,595 --> 00:04:01,728
You've gotta get strong...

55
00:04:01,762 --> 00:04:02,762
In mind and body.

56
00:04:02,795 --> 00:04:04,762
Sounds good to me!

57
00:04:04,795 --> 00:04:05,428
Oh snap...

58
00:04:05,462 --> 00:04:07,428
Nipple contact.

59
00:04:07,462 --> 00:04:08,495
Remember!

60
00:04:08,528 --> 00:04:09,662
The stronger you get,
the more powerful you are.

61
00:04:09,695 --> 00:04:12,162
The more powerful you are,
the more you can accomplish.

62
00:04:12,195 --> 00:04:14,428
Yes, ma'am!

63
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:17,862
Three...! four!

64
00:04:19,028 --> 00:04:22,695
All I want out of life is to be
able to motorboat that booty!

65
00:04:24,762 --> 00:04:26,495
Don't think I don't know
you're having disgusting,

66
00:04:26,528 --> 00:04:28,462
sexually charged thoughts
about me right now!

67
00:04:28,495 --> 00:04:30,895
Look, I can't help it,
I'm a teenager,

68
00:04:30,928 --> 00:04:32,562
if I get within
ten feet of a hot girl

69
00:04:32,595 --> 00:04:35,062
I start thinking about
what she looks like naked.

70
00:04:35,095 --> 00:04:37,162
Speaking of which,
I wonder what's keeping her?

71
00:04:37,195 --> 00:04:38,028
Who...?

72
00:04:38,062 --> 00:04:40,028
I'm just gonna
imagine her naked, too.

73
00:04:40,895 --> 00:04:42,795
Hey, you guys, I'm here!

74
00:04:42,828 --> 00:04:44,528
So sorry that I'm late...

75
00:04:44,562 --> 00:04:47,128
I swear, I won't let
it happen again-

76
00:04:48,595 --> 00:04:53,495
I'm no good at running and
talking at the same time.

77
00:04:53,528 --> 00:04:54,395
Here ya go.

78
00:04:54,428 --> 00:04:55,662
Thanks a lot.

79
00:04:56,495 --> 00:04:58,462
So, tell me, what are
you doing here anyway?

80
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:00,562
Oh, Rias asked me
if I could come.

81
00:05:00,595 --> 00:05:02,428
That true?

82
00:05:02,462 --> 00:05:03,895
Why would you do that...?

83
00:05:04,795 --> 00:05:06,528
Rias?

84
00:05:06,562 --> 00:05:07,428
I'm sorry.

85
00:05:07,462 --> 00:05:09,628
What's the matter,
is everything okay?

86
00:05:09,662 --> 00:05:11,762
Now that everybody's here,
we should probably go.

87
00:05:11,795 --> 00:05:13,728
Um, go where?

88
00:05:13,762 --> 00:05:16,795
We're going to
your house of course.

89
00:05:17,128 --> 00:05:19,162
Uh... Whose boxes are these?

90
00:05:19,195 --> 00:05:20,862
Yeah, that's all my stuff.

91
00:05:20,895 --> 00:05:21,862
Yours?

92
00:05:21,895 --> 00:05:23,795
Apparently, I had more
than I thought I did.

93
00:05:23,828 --> 00:05:24,895
But why did you bring it here?

94
00:05:24,928 --> 00:05:25,928
What's going on?

95
00:05:25,962 --> 00:05:28,595
Well, as of today,
Asia's going to be moving in

96
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:29,695
with you and your parents.

97
00:05:29,728 --> 00:05:30,495
She's what?

98
00:05:30,528 --> 00:05:32,662
It's very sweet
of you to let me!

99
00:05:32,695 --> 00:05:34,528
When I asked her
where she'd like to live,

100
00:05:34,562 --> 00:05:36,128
the first thing she said
was, 'Issei's house.'

101
00:05:36,162 --> 00:05:37,128
Hey!

102
00:05:37,162 --> 00:05:39,028
Who the hell said I was
looking for a roommate?!

103
00:05:39,062 --> 00:05:41,795
Uh, Sorry, what was your
name again, was it Asia?

104
00:05:41,828 --> 00:05:43,095
Close, it's Asia.

105
00:05:43,128 --> 00:05:45,762
Right, uh, listen Asia,
surely there's a better

106
00:05:45,795 --> 00:05:48,428
long-term living situation
than moving in with us.

107
00:05:48,462 --> 00:05:51,095
The thing is, I owe your son
and I need to pay him back.

108
00:05:51,128 --> 00:05:52,028
Owe him?

109
00:05:52,062 --> 00:05:53,162
Yeah...

110
00:05:53,195 --> 00:05:54,928
I came to this
town all by myself,

111
00:05:54,962 --> 00:05:56,428
and I don't know
what I would have done

112
00:05:56,462 --> 00:05:57,895
if it wasn't for Issei...

113
00:05:57,928 --> 00:05:59,895
He took care of me,
and now, if it's okay,

114
00:05:59,928 --> 00:06:02,428
I'd like to have the
chance to take care of him.

115
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:02,862
Wow...

116
00:06:02,895 --> 00:06:04,128
That's so nice.

117
00:06:04,162 --> 00:06:06,695
But if it puts you out in any
way, I can go somewhere else.

118
00:06:06,728 --> 00:06:07,728
Ohh!

119
00:06:07,762 --> 00:06:08,928
Darling, we're not
saying you can't stay here,

120
00:06:08,962 --> 00:06:11,595
and Lord knows we have the room,
it's just the thing is...

121
00:06:11,628 --> 00:06:12,428
Issei...

122
00:06:12,462 --> 00:06:14,428
Issei is an abnormally
horny child.

123
00:06:14,462 --> 00:06:16,728
He's a pervert and
he's not to be trusted.

124
00:06:16,762 --> 00:06:17,928
Well put.

125
00:06:17,962 --> 00:06:20,895
Come on, Dad, how can you
say that about your own son?!

126
00:06:20,928 --> 00:06:22,995
In addition to room and board,
there's something else

127
00:06:23,028 --> 00:06:25,095
she can get out of
living here with you...

128
00:06:25,128 --> 00:06:26,828
She can learn to be a good wife.

129
00:06:26,862 --> 00:06:28,595
She can learn what?

130
00:06:28,628 --> 00:06:30,862
All these years, I never thought
we'd actually find someone

131
00:06:30,895 --> 00:06:32,528
willing to sleep
with this big lunk

132
00:06:32,562 --> 00:06:34,395
and give us some grandchildren!

133
00:06:34,428 --> 00:06:35,095
Dad!

134
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:36,095
Maybe a marriage will get rid of

135
00:06:36,128 --> 00:06:38,728
his unhealthy obsession
with the pornography!

136
00:06:38,762 --> 00:06:40,428
Mom, you're killing me!

137
00:06:40,462 --> 00:06:41,928
I'm sure you both know this...

138
00:06:41,962 --> 00:06:45,095
But I wanted to say that
your son is a great guy.

139
00:06:45,128 --> 00:06:47,462
Well, isn't she
cute as a button?!

140
00:06:47,495 --> 00:06:48,428
Sure is...!

141
00:06:48,462 --> 00:06:49,795
Miss Rias, we would
love to take in Asia,

142
00:06:49,828 --> 00:06:51,162
and let her live
with our pervert son.

143
00:06:51,195 --> 00:06:53,495
This may be his only chance!

144
00:06:53,528 --> 00:06:55,095
Thank you very much
for your kindness

145
00:06:55,128 --> 00:06:56,862
mister and misses Hyodo...

146
00:06:56,895 --> 00:06:58,695
I guess that settles it.

147
00:06:59,795 --> 00:07:01,728
Uh, just cuz everyone's
talking about marriage,

148
00:07:01,762 --> 00:07:03,428
doesn't mean we're
really doing it.

149
00:07:03,462 --> 00:07:04,528
Right?

150
00:07:08,028 --> 00:07:09,462
If you're lucky.

151
00:07:09,495 --> 00:07:10,762
You okay?

152
00:07:17,162 --> 00:07:19,895
My name is Asia Argento.

153
00:07:19,928 --> 00:07:22,795
I'm feeling a bit like
a fish out of water...

154
00:07:22,828 --> 00:07:24,695
But I'm excited to be here.

155
00:07:25,828 --> 00:07:26,995
Shorty's hot!

156
00:07:27,028 --> 00:07:29,495
Bust: thirty four, waist:
twenty six, hips: thirty five.

157
00:07:29,528 --> 00:07:31,728
And look at all that hair!

158
00:07:31,762 --> 00:07:32,828
Awesome.

159
00:07:32,862 --> 00:07:34,495
She's gonna be in my class.

160
00:07:34,528 --> 00:07:36,162
Rias must have
pulled some strings.

161
00:07:36,195 --> 00:07:38,062
Being in a new school
in a strange town

162
00:07:38,095 --> 00:07:41,428
can be overwhelming, but
luckily I'm staying with Issei!

163
00:07:41,462 --> 00:07:42,695
Bastard!

164
00:07:42,728 --> 00:07:43,828
Yo, what the eff, you tellin'
me that hottie lives with you

165
00:07:43,862 --> 00:07:46,095
and you ain't dropped a
dime to your homies bout it?!

166
00:07:46,128 --> 00:07:48,395
Come on dude, don't
hold out, tell us your secret,

167
00:07:48,428 --> 00:07:50,062
have you sworn off
porn or something?!

168
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:51,962
Look, I didn't have
anything to do with this!

169
00:07:51,995 --> 00:07:53,228
Yo, seriously though dawg,
what's her situation?

170
00:07:53,262 --> 00:07:55,962
This is great, I think people
are really gonna like her here.

171
00:07:55,995 --> 00:07:56,995
Hey, Asia...?

172
00:07:57,028 --> 00:07:57,662
Listen.

173
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:59,562
Your room has a lock, right?

174
00:07:59,595 --> 00:08:01,162
Yeah.

175
00:08:01,195 --> 00:08:02,762
I bet he like masturbates
in the bathroom,

176
00:08:02,795 --> 00:08:04,128
so watch out for pubes.

177
00:08:04,162 --> 00:08:06,062
I'll have to keep that in mind.

178
00:08:06,095 --> 00:08:07,728
Also, there could be
hidden cameras planted

179
00:08:07,762 --> 00:08:09,662
all over the house,
so check everything.

180
00:08:09,695 --> 00:08:10,728
Oh, okay.

181
00:08:10,762 --> 00:08:12,762
All right everyone,
that's enough!

182
00:08:21,028 --> 00:08:22,128
You must be exhausted.

183
00:08:22,162 --> 00:08:23,328
No, I'm wide awake,

184
00:08:23,362 --> 00:08:26,428
I'm still excited about how
nice everyone was today...!

185
00:08:26,462 --> 00:08:29,962
Especially your two best
friends, Matsuda and Motohama!

186
00:08:29,995 --> 00:08:32,628
Hey, they didn't do
anything creepy, did they?

187
00:08:32,662 --> 00:08:34,495
No, but they said they
wanted to invite me

188
00:08:34,528 --> 00:08:36,395
to something called
a 'devil's three-way'?

189
00:08:36,428 --> 00:08:38,528
Whatever you do, promise
me you won't go to that.

190
00:08:38,562 --> 00:08:39,728
Okay.

191
00:08:42,662 --> 00:08:43,495
You okay?

192
00:08:43,528 --> 00:08:45,795
Yeah, I'm fine,
don't worry about me.

193
00:08:55,062 --> 00:08:56,595
You all right?

194
00:08:56,628 --> 00:08:58,828
Heck yeah, I'm fine.

195
00:08:58,862 --> 00:08:59,962
Kay.

196
00:09:06,728 --> 00:09:07,328
Hey...

197
00:09:07,362 --> 00:09:09,128
Asia and I just got back!

198
00:09:09,728 --> 00:09:11,695
Earth to Rias?

199
00:09:11,728 --> 00:09:12,728
Oh, I'm sorry.

200
00:09:12,762 --> 00:09:14,695
I guess I spaced out
there for a little bit...

201
00:09:14,728 --> 00:09:16,928
It's been one of those days.

202
00:09:16,962 --> 00:09:17,928
Asia?

203
00:09:17,962 --> 00:09:19,828
Yes ma'am?

204
00:09:20,862 --> 00:09:22,495
If you don't have
any problems with it,

205
00:09:22,528 --> 00:09:24,562
I was thinking you could
make your big debut tonight.

206
00:09:24,595 --> 00:09:26,395
Debut?

207
00:09:26,428 --> 00:09:27,862
Basically, you jump
to a potential client

208
00:09:27,895 --> 00:09:30,695
using a magic circle and try
to make a pact with them...

209
00:09:30,728 --> 00:09:32,828
But don't you think it
might be too early for that?

210
00:09:32,862 --> 00:09:33,762
I mean, Asia's brand new;

211
00:09:33,795 --> 00:09:36,062
she hasn't even been
a devil for a week.

212
00:09:36,095 --> 00:09:37,762
You need to relax.

213
00:09:37,795 --> 00:09:39,928
Don't you worry your precious
pumpkin head about her,

214
00:09:39,962 --> 00:09:42,628
she'll be totally awesome;
when it comes to magical powers,

215
00:09:42,662 --> 00:09:44,895
that girl's got almost
as much game as I do.

216
00:09:44,928 --> 00:09:46,728
Are you serious?

217
00:09:47,728 --> 00:09:49,428
I couldn't agree
with you guys more.

218
00:09:49,462 --> 00:09:51,062
Didn't make her my
bishop for nothing.

219
00:09:51,095 --> 00:09:53,595
Congrats on that, too:
bishop's impressive.

220
00:09:53,628 --> 00:09:54,095
Uh...

221
00:09:54,128 --> 00:09:55,028
Thanks a lot.

222
00:09:55,062 --> 00:09:55,895
I should be happy for her,

223
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:57,562
but I kind of want
to kill myself...

224
00:09:57,595 --> 00:09:58,795
Wait...

225
00:09:58,828 --> 00:10:01,695
I may be a shitty pawn, but
at least I know my way around!

226
00:10:01,728 --> 00:10:05,728
Asia's not ready
to go out there alone!

227
00:10:05,762 --> 00:10:07,428
Asia, what's wrong, you okay?

228
00:10:07,462 --> 00:10:08,695
Oh, I'm fine...

229
00:10:08,728 --> 00:10:10,895
I'm just nervous, that's all...

230
00:10:10,928 --> 00:10:12,695
Rias!

231
00:10:12,728 --> 00:10:13,762
Yeah?

232
00:10:13,795 --> 00:10:15,795
I think it'd be better
if I went in Asia's place.

233
00:10:15,828 --> 00:10:16,695
Really??

234
00:10:16,728 --> 00:10:17,162
Yeah...

235
00:10:17,195 --> 00:10:18,095
Of course...

236
00:10:18,128 --> 00:10:19,528
You haven't been in
the area long enough

237
00:10:19,562 --> 00:10:20,528
to know your way around yet...

238
00:10:20,562 --> 00:10:22,495
We'll send you out
after you've had a chance

239
00:10:22,528 --> 00:10:24,628
to get a better
feel for the place.

240
00:10:27,128 --> 00:10:29,162
I'm glad I volunteered
to go on her behalf.

241
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:30,795
These summon requests
can be dangerous;

242
00:10:30,828 --> 00:10:32,428
there's no telling what
could be waiting for you

243
00:10:32,462 --> 00:10:33,828
on the other side.

244
00:10:33,862 --> 00:10:35,028
Don't be scared.

245
00:10:35,062 --> 00:10:36,495
I'm gonna make a pact with you

246
00:10:36,528 --> 00:10:38,795
and then you're gonna
do whatever I say...

247
00:10:38,828 --> 00:10:39,495
Please don't!

248
00:10:39,528 --> 00:10:41,462
Isn't that right, little girl?!

249
00:10:44,662 --> 00:10:45,462
Really, Issei?

250
00:10:45,495 --> 00:10:47,395
The monster rips
her clothes off too?

251
00:10:50,528 --> 00:10:53,595
Door's open,
come on in sweet tits.

252
00:10:54,062 --> 00:10:55,528
Sweet tits...?

253
00:10:55,562 --> 00:10:56,828
I'm leaving...

254
00:10:56,862 --> 00:10:58,095
Yep.

255
00:11:01,028 --> 00:11:02,762
What's the 411, girl...?

256
00:11:02,795 --> 00:11:04,362
I'm Miltan!

257
00:11:21,877 --> 00:11:22,844
Nice to meet you...

258
00:11:22,877 --> 00:11:24,711
You didn't by any chance
happen to summon a devil

259
00:11:24,744 --> 00:11:27,777
from the house of
Gremory, did you?

260
00:11:28,711 --> 00:11:30,044
You know it, bitch...

261
00:11:30,077 --> 00:11:31,677
This tall drink of
chardonnay has a wish

262
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:33,644
she wants your ass to fulfill.

263
00:11:35,177 --> 00:11:36,811
Look here, Tiny Tim,
Miltan wants you

264
00:11:36,844 --> 00:11:39,077
to turn her into a
magical fairy princess!

265
00:11:39,111 --> 00:11:41,044
Yeah and I wish I looked
like an underwear model.

266
00:11:41,077 --> 00:11:42,944
Let's be real here, sweetie.

267
00:11:42,977 --> 00:11:44,277
Dude, you're missing the point!

268
00:11:44,311 --> 00:11:45,644
Come on, devil man!

269
00:11:45,677 --> 00:11:46,744
There's nothing I can do!

270
00:11:46,777 --> 00:11:48,144
Please just give
me fabulous powers;

271
00:11:48,177 --> 00:11:50,211
I'll let you lick my lollipop.

272
00:11:50,244 --> 00:11:53,244
Trust me on this, bro,
you're fabulous enough already.

273
00:11:54,744 --> 00:11:58,011
But I want to be super-magical
like a fairy in a pink tutu!

274
00:11:58,044 --> 00:11:58,744
Quiet...!

275
00:11:58,777 --> 00:11:59,711
You need to take
it down a notch,

276
00:11:59,744 --> 00:12:01,677
you don't wanna wake
the neighbors, do you?!

277
00:12:01,711 --> 00:12:03,077
All right, we can talk about it.

278
00:12:03,111 --> 00:12:04,177
Perfect.

279
00:12:04,211 --> 00:12:05,844
While we talk we should
paint our nails and gossip!

280
00:12:05,877 --> 00:12:08,111
Yeah, whatever,
let's just go inside!

281
00:12:12,011 --> 00:12:13,244
I've got a dazzling idea...

282
00:12:13,277 --> 00:12:14,377
To get us in the mood,

283
00:12:14,411 --> 00:12:17,011
let's watch this amazing
episode of Magical Milky Girl,

284
00:12:17,044 --> 00:12:18,544
she's only the
most fabulous hooker

285
00:12:18,577 --> 00:12:21,044
our side of the
pacific, b'okay?!

286
00:12:21,077 --> 00:12:22,111
Kill me now...

287
00:12:22,144 --> 00:12:24,811
Take me outside and
shoot me in my stupid face.

288
00:12:27,744 --> 00:12:30,777
I'm starting to think
I'm some sorta creepster magnet.

289
00:12:34,744 --> 00:12:35,644
Crap, it's Rias.

290
00:12:35,677 --> 00:12:36,577
Congratulations!

291
00:12:36,611 --> 00:12:39,011
I just got word you
finished the job...

292
00:12:39,044 --> 00:12:40,011
So how'd it go?

293
00:12:40,044 --> 00:12:42,944
Uh... Weird?

294
00:12:50,011 --> 00:12:50,877
Dude...!

295
00:12:50,911 --> 00:12:51,677
Check it out!

296
00:12:51,711 --> 00:12:52,944
Those gym shorts
are so scandalous

297
00:12:52,977 --> 00:12:56,244
if you catch the right angle,
you'll get a full on panty shot!

298
00:12:56,277 --> 00:12:57,177
Aww, snap!

299
00:12:57,211 --> 00:12:58,377
I think I see it, homie!

300
00:12:58,411 --> 00:13:02,311
There's def some lacy bits
comin' out them booty shorts!

301
00:13:02,344 --> 00:13:04,677
So, once again,
you didn't get a pact.

302
00:13:04,711 --> 00:13:07,077
He, or she, or whatever made
me watch a bunch of anime

303
00:13:07,111 --> 00:13:09,211
which actually turned out
to be pretty good stuff.

304
00:13:09,244 --> 00:13:11,177
But that was it.

305
00:13:11,211 --> 00:13:12,144
Well...

306
00:13:12,177 --> 00:13:14,111
I'm disappointed to
hear it didn't work out.

307
00:13:15,344 --> 00:13:18,577
Surprise, surprise, I screwed
the pooch yet again...!

308
00:13:18,611 --> 00:13:20,677
Ah, I'm such a freakin' idiot!

309
00:13:21,211 --> 00:13:22,377
Oh who cares...?

310
00:13:22,411 --> 00:13:25,177
This day sucks, I'm gonna
skip class and go take a nap.

311
00:13:43,077 --> 00:13:45,677
Holy crap!

312
00:13:45,711 --> 00:13:48,044
Oh no, my hand's
moving on its own!

313
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:48,744
No...!

314
00:13:48,777 --> 00:13:51,777
Stop it right hand, don't do it!

315
00:13:52,277 --> 00:13:54,544
Okay, go ahead and do it.

316
00:13:55,144 --> 00:13:57,711
Hi there, Issei.

317
00:13:57,744 --> 00:13:59,977
I totally wasn't about
to grab your dink-dinks!

318
00:14:00,011 --> 00:14:01,577
I'm sorry, I felt
a little sleepy,

319
00:14:01,611 --> 00:14:03,244
so I thought
I'd grab a quick nap.

320
00:14:03,277 --> 00:14:06,177
You were already here,
so I had to join you...

321
00:14:06,211 --> 00:14:08,177
Oh, my wings.

322
00:14:08,711 --> 00:14:09,744
Hey... You okay?

323
00:14:09,777 --> 00:14:10,711
Yeah, it's just...

324
00:14:10,744 --> 00:14:12,111
...most people don't
take naps in the nude,

325
00:14:12,144 --> 00:14:13,911
that's not exactly
normal, you know?

326
00:14:13,944 --> 00:14:16,611
I'm sorry, but I can't
sleep unless I'm naked.

327
00:14:17,344 --> 00:14:20,244
So, Issei, would you say
you're a big admirer of breasts?

328
00:14:20,277 --> 00:14:21,644
Boobs're good.

329
00:14:21,677 --> 00:14:23,111
Do you wanna touch mine...?

330
00:14:23,144 --> 00:14:25,044
You can if you want.

331
00:14:26,877 --> 00:14:28,744
Wanna touch my boobs...?

332
00:14:28,777 --> 00:14:30,811
You can if you want.

333
00:14:32,811 --> 00:14:33,711
I'm sorry.

334
00:14:33,744 --> 00:14:35,544
Did I just die and
go to fun bag heaven?

335
00:14:35,577 --> 00:14:36,777
If you promise to do what I ask;

336
00:14:36,811 --> 00:14:38,777
I promise I'll let
you touch them.

337
00:14:38,811 --> 00:14:39,177
Yes...!

338
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:40,744
Anything!

339
00:14:41,611 --> 00:14:42,711
Okay...

340
00:14:42,744 --> 00:14:45,177
I want you to go out there
right now and get a pact.

341
00:14:48,877 --> 00:14:51,177
Do you really think it's
necessary for us to go together?

342
00:14:51,211 --> 00:14:53,911
Absolutely, it's never a bad
thing to have a seasoned pro

343
00:14:53,944 --> 00:14:57,511
by your side when
you're out on a big job.

344
00:14:57,811 --> 00:15:00,544
That's true, there's no way
I can fail if she's with me.

345
00:15:00,577 --> 00:15:02,244
Titty twisting time!

346
00:15:02,977 --> 00:15:03,844
Good luck, Issei!

347
00:15:03,877 --> 00:15:04,944
You'll do great!

348
00:15:04,977 --> 00:15:06,944
Thanks, I'm feeling
good about this!

349
00:15:07,244 --> 00:15:08,244
Get ready you guys!

350
00:15:08,277 --> 00:15:09,877
I'm sending you now!

351
00:15:16,911 --> 00:15:18,977
This place is cool.

352
00:15:19,011 --> 00:15:22,544
If your definition of cool is a
nerd who collects samurai stuff.

353
00:15:25,177 --> 00:15:25,777
Umm...

354
00:15:25,811 --> 00:15:28,077
You're the devils, right?

355
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:30,644
Wow, definitely didn't
see that one coming...

356
00:15:30,677 --> 00:15:31,777
So you're a girl?

357
00:15:31,811 --> 00:15:33,077
Yep.

358
00:15:33,111 --> 00:15:36,077
I'm Susan-san and I'm a
foreign exchange student.

359
00:15:36,111 --> 00:15:38,844
I love Japanese culture;
it's totally Kkru.

360
00:15:38,877 --> 00:15:40,977
Guess that explains your outfit.

361
00:15:41,011 --> 00:15:42,611
This area's really
scary at night,

362
00:15:42,644 --> 00:15:44,277
so I wear this samurai 'yofuku'

363
00:15:44,311 --> 00:15:46,777
to scare all the
bad people away.

364
00:15:46,811 --> 00:15:48,644
Well, it's creepy;
I'll give you that much.

365
00:15:48,677 --> 00:15:49,477
ArigatM!

366
00:15:49,511 --> 00:15:51,044
I'm so glad
you're a nice devil...

367
00:15:51,077 --> 00:15:52,544
If you'd been kowai
I'd have no choice

368
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:55,011
but to grab my samurai
blade, draw on you

369
00:15:55,044 --> 00:15:56,311
and slice you up like sushi!

370
00:15:56,344 --> 00:15:57,877
Take it easy!

371
00:15:57,911 --> 00:16:00,677
So, Susan, tell me...
what can we do for you today?

372
00:16:01,844 --> 00:16:02,777
Well...

373
00:16:02,811 --> 00:16:04,211
The thing is, I left
my notebook at school

374
00:16:04,244 --> 00:16:07,077
and I'm too scared to go
and get it by my jiko.

375
00:16:07,111 --> 00:16:07,744
Wait...

376
00:16:07,777 --> 00:16:08,844
Is that it?

377
00:16:08,877 --> 00:16:12,011
You don't understand,
it's super scary out there!

378
00:16:13,011 --> 00:16:15,544
Not nearly as scary as you are.

379
00:16:16,311 --> 00:16:17,111
Yep, it's official.

380
00:16:17,144 --> 00:16:19,011
I am absolutely,
one hundred percent,

381
00:16:19,044 --> 00:16:21,077
a full blown creepster magnet.

382
00:16:23,344 --> 00:16:24,244
Hey, what is it?!

383
00:16:24,277 --> 00:16:25,177
Sorry.

384
00:16:25,211 --> 00:16:27,011
Like I said, it's
really scary out here.

385
00:16:27,044 --> 00:16:29,744
And like I said,
you're the scary one!

386
00:16:30,344 --> 00:16:32,077
ArigatM gozaimashita!

387
00:16:32,111 --> 00:16:34,511
I have no idea what
the hell you just said.

388
00:16:36,744 --> 00:16:38,744
This is about to be
the best day of my life!

389
00:16:38,777 --> 00:16:40,611
I got one free ticket
on the tits train

390
00:16:40,644 --> 00:16:43,711
to tig ol bitty city and
it's about to leave the station!

391
00:16:43,744 --> 00:16:46,211
First, I'm gonna bang those bean
bags like they're bongo drums!

392
00:16:46,244 --> 00:16:49,711
Then I'm gonna put my
face in 'em and ppbbbbtttt.

393
00:16:49,744 --> 00:16:51,244
Sumimasen?

394
00:16:51,277 --> 00:16:53,011
You're really starting
to freak me out!

395
00:16:53,044 --> 00:16:53,977
I hate to be a bother,

396
00:16:54,011 --> 00:16:57,544
but there's one more
sansei I need you to do.

397
00:16:57,577 --> 00:16:59,711
And I hate to be a
bummer, but no way.

398
00:16:59,744 --> 00:17:01,311
Only one request per visit.

399
00:17:01,344 --> 00:17:03,077
Nonsense, we'd be glad to help.

400
00:17:03,111 --> 00:17:04,811
Are you kidding me?!

401
00:17:06,144 --> 00:17:07,811
Tell me about this guy.

402
00:17:07,844 --> 00:17:10,844
I really like him, but
I'm kind of a shy Shouju...

403
00:17:10,877 --> 00:17:13,111
I don't know how
to talk to hitobito.

404
00:17:13,144 --> 00:17:14,577
I bet he's a total samurai nerd,

405
00:17:14,611 --> 00:17:16,977
complete with armor,
a sword and his virginity.

406
00:17:17,011 --> 00:17:19,677
You want us to make him fall
in love with you, is that it?

407
00:17:19,711 --> 00:17:20,511
Oh, no.

408
00:17:20,544 --> 00:17:22,577
I don't want to
force him to Koi me.

409
00:17:22,611 --> 00:17:25,011
I want him to Koi me on his own.

410
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,177
I'd like to Koi you
right in the face!

411
00:17:29,777 --> 00:17:31,011
So...

412
00:17:31,044 --> 00:17:32,911
Have you tried opening up to him
and telling him how you feel?

413
00:17:32,944 --> 00:17:33,411
Oh...

414
00:17:33,444 --> 00:17:34,244
No, I couldn't...

415
00:17:34,277 --> 00:17:36,544
I wouldn't even
know where to begin!

416
00:17:38,111 --> 00:17:40,077
What about a letter?

417
00:17:40,111 --> 00:17:41,277
A rabureta?

418
00:17:41,311 --> 00:17:42,277
Not bad...

419
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:44,111
A love letter might just work.

420
00:17:44,144 --> 00:17:45,744
You think so?

421
00:17:45,777 --> 00:17:47,611
Writing down what you
feel can be a great way

422
00:17:47,644 --> 00:17:49,044
to express yourself.

423
00:17:49,077 --> 00:17:50,177
Daijobu...

424
00:17:50,211 --> 00:17:52,077
I'll give it a try!

425
00:17:57,047 --> 00:17:59,547
"Shall I compare thee
to a summer's day?"

426
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,347
This is gonna be pafekuto.

427
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,647
Isn't the whole point to write
something that's original?

428
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,413
I think it's great.

429
00:18:05,447 --> 00:18:06,413
The only thing that matters

430
00:18:06,447 --> 00:18:08,780
is the feeling you
communicate, not the form.

431
00:18:08,813 --> 00:18:10,280
Well, using someone
else's feelings

432
00:18:10,313 --> 00:18:11,813
seems like a copout to me.

433
00:18:11,847 --> 00:18:13,013
It's hard...

434
00:18:13,047 --> 00:18:15,313
To say the way you feel.

435
00:18:15,347 --> 00:18:17,380
It's so hard...

436
00:18:17,413 --> 00:18:18,647
But it's good.

437
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,547
Okay?

438
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:20,913
Sore de kimatta!

439
00:18:20,947 --> 00:18:22,480
Oh for crying out loud.

440
00:18:22,513 --> 00:18:24,480
That's how you're
gonna send the letter?!

441
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:27,747
Mommy, mommy, look, what's that?

442
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:28,713
Just keep walking...

443
00:18:28,747 --> 00:18:29,813
Come on!

444
00:18:32,747 --> 00:18:33,513
Oh man...

445
00:18:33,547 --> 00:18:34,980
No way this ends good.

446
00:18:35,013 --> 00:18:36,713
It looks like he's here.

447
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,647
The arrow!

448
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,547
This is bad.

449
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:43,980
You shot him right
in the fucking head!

450
00:18:44,013 --> 00:18:44,613
Yeah...

451
00:18:44,647 --> 00:18:46,480
Sorry, I have good aim...

452
00:18:46,513 --> 00:18:47,613
I tried to think of other ways,

453
00:18:47,647 --> 00:18:50,580
but shooting the arrow at
him seemed to be the best.

454
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:54,447
Oh shit, that guy
looks really pissed off.

455
00:19:07,347 --> 00:19:08,947
I've perused your
letter, my lady,

456
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,613
and I'm shot through the heart!

457
00:19:10,647 --> 00:19:12,613
Not the head!

458
00:19:12,647 --> 00:19:14,347
To think that I, of all people,

459
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:16,013
would be caught
off guard like this...

460
00:19:16,047 --> 00:19:17,847
I'm truly overwhelmed.

461
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,613
I'm so head over bearskin boot

462
00:19:19,647 --> 00:19:22,980
in Koi, You were all
I could think of, Horii.

463
00:19:23,013 --> 00:19:24,147
My Samurai!

464
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:26,280
Am I the only one who feels
like they're going crazy?

465
00:19:26,313 --> 00:19:27,347
If you'll have me,

466
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:30,880
I'd be honored to be your
knight in shining yoroi.

467
00:19:30,913 --> 00:19:34,380
Oh, Horii-san!

468
00:19:34,413 --> 00:19:35,547
Ai shi teru!

469
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:36,913
Susan-san!

470
00:19:36,947 --> 00:19:38,713
Your helmet's magnificent!

471
00:19:38,747 --> 00:19:39,813
No.

472
00:19:39,847 --> 00:19:42,947
Your helmet's so hard,
and your nihonto is so long!

473
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:45,047
Those two sure were
a match made in armor.

474
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:48,047
More like a match made
in the insane asylum.

475
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,547
So what do you think?

476
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:51,480
About what?

477
00:19:51,513 --> 00:19:53,047
About being together
with the person you love

478
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,947
more than anything in the world.

479
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:56,280
Well, I don't know...

480
00:19:56,313 --> 00:19:57,747
I guess it sounds kinda nice.

481
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,347
Yes, it does...

482
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:00,613
Very nice.

483
00:20:00,647 --> 00:20:02,747
Plus.

484
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:04,047
It's way better than hanging out

485
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,147
with someone
you don't even like,

486
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:09,447
and making them like you
and then screwing them over!

487
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:12,813
Now that would be super shitty.

488
00:20:12,847 --> 00:20:15,847
Someone like-Never mind.

489
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:18,680
Don't listen to me, I'm
emotionally damaged I think.

490
00:20:18,713 --> 00:20:19,947
No, please...

491
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:22,447
I'm glad you gave
me a real answer.

492
00:20:25,647 --> 00:20:26,713
But never mind that...

493
00:20:26,747 --> 00:20:28,780
You said you wanted to
talk to me about something.

494
00:20:28,813 --> 00:20:30,280
Yeah, that's right!

495
00:20:30,313 --> 00:20:31,313
No one else is around!

496
00:20:31,347 --> 00:20:32,580
It's time for Issei Hyodo

497
00:20:32,613 --> 00:20:35,580
to play a tiddy-ditty
on her dueling banjos!

498
00:20:35,613 --> 00:20:36,480
Your gazongas!

499
00:20:36,513 --> 00:20:37,747
It's about your gazongas!

500
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:39,347
What are you saying, Issei...?

501
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:42,047
I've no idea to
what you're referring.

502
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,880
No fair, you said if I got
a pact I could touch them!!!

503
00:20:45,913 --> 00:20:47,980
I never said that.

504
00:20:48,013 --> 00:20:50,713
I'm just teasing you,
I'll make good on my promise...

505
00:20:50,747 --> 00:20:51,813
Now then...

506
00:20:51,847 --> 00:20:54,047
From this moment until
I finish counting to five...

507
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,880
They're all yours...

508
00:20:55,913 --> 00:20:57,880
You can squeeze away.

509
00:20:57,913 --> 00:20:59,413
Score!

510
00:20:59,447 --> 00:20:59,980
One.

511
00:21:00,013 --> 00:21:00,880
Wait a second...!

512
00:21:00,913 --> 00:21:02,480
You've gotta give me
some warning here!

513
00:21:02,513 --> 00:21:04,913
Two.

514
00:21:04,947 --> 00:21:07,047
We're at two and I haven't
even formulated a plan yet.

515
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,513
Three.

516
00:21:08,547 --> 00:21:10,347
All right, Issei, get
your shit together...!

517
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:10,980
Should I go for the right...?

518
00:21:11,013 --> 00:21:12,547
Or feel up the left?

519
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:13,513
Four.

520
00:21:13,547 --> 00:21:14,480
Dude, moment of truth.

521
00:21:14,513 --> 00:21:17,847
Gotta be the double
pinch nipple twist!!!

522
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:18,747
Oh hey there, Issei...

523
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:21,313
I didn't know you
were gonna be here!

524
00:21:21,347 --> 00:21:22,280
Are we too late?

525
00:21:22,313 --> 00:21:22,913
What it do.

526
00:21:22,947 --> 00:21:23,980
Five.

527
00:21:24,013 --> 00:21:27,413
Aww, sorry Issei, it looks
like you're outta time.

528
00:21:27,447 --> 00:21:30,313
You look like somebody just
kicked you in the balls, honey!

529
00:21:30,347 --> 00:21:32,647
It sure feels like it.

530
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,980
Issei, you're so ridiculous,
do you know that...?

531
00:21:35,013 --> 00:21:39,313
You cannot possibly be
that hard up to cop a feel.

532
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:41,747
All right...

533
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:42,313
Fine...

534
00:21:42,347 --> 00:21:54,313
But this is all you get.

535
00:21:54,347 --> 00:21:57,013
Uh... You do realize everyone's
staring at us, right?

536
00:21:57,047 --> 00:22:00,880
Next time, do your job well,
whether there's a reward or not.

537
00:22:05,047 --> 00:22:07,513
Yeah... cool.

538
00:22:09,047 --> 00:22:10,513
No way...

539
00:22:10,547 --> 00:22:13,347
Rias is totally into him...

540
00:23:48,713 --> 00:23:49,847
Sorry to interrupt

541
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:52,313
Whoa, what the heck
is she doing here?!

542
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:54,813
I'd like to see them play a
little two on two on my junk!

543
00:23:54,847 --> 00:23:57,013
I'm so slimy and wet!

544
00:23:58,647 --> 00:23:59,713
No!

545
00:23:59,747 --> 00:24:02,780
Dude, this is the best thing
that has ever happened!
