1
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:16,866
Damn it!

2
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:18,366
Ain't no way, bro!

3
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,133
This has to be
some kind of mistake.

4
00:00:21,166 --> 00:00:22,633
Guys?

5
00:00:22,666 --> 00:00:24,100
Why're you crying?

6
00:00:24,133 --> 00:00:25,300
What the... huh?

7
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:27,066
It's your wedding, day!

8
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:29,066
I told myself
I wouldn't cry this time!

9
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:29,533
What?

10
00:00:29,566 --> 00:00:30,400
Wedding?

11
00:00:30,433 --> 00:00:33,133
I hope our first
grandchild is a girl.

12
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:34,633
Most of your life,
you've been an idiot...

13
00:00:34,666 --> 00:00:36,433
We never imagined
we'd actually get

14
00:00:36,466 --> 00:00:38,166
the chance to one
day be proud of you.

15
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:38,966
Hey, come on!

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,366
No more looking
at other girls...

17
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,366
Issei...

18
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,466
It's you?!

19
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,566
Rias...

20
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,233
You're like, so fetch!

21
00:00:45,266 --> 00:00:46,200
Totes gorgeous.

22
00:00:46,233 --> 00:00:47,166
I still can't believe

23
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,400
you're marrying that
twisted, sicko loser.

24
00:00:49,433 --> 00:00:50,600
Are they serious...?

25
00:00:50,633 --> 00:00:52,633
I'm marrying her?

26
00:00:52,666 --> 00:00:54,166
Do you promise
to have and to hold...

27
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,733
When the hell did
all this get decided?

28
00:00:55,766 --> 00:00:57,400
Although, I gotta say,

29
00:00:57,433 --> 00:01:01,100
if I'm gonna marry anyone,
I could definitely do worse.

30
00:01:01,133 --> 00:01:02,566
Plus... if we're
getting hitched,

31
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,333
that means we'll
be making babies.

32
00:01:04,366 --> 00:01:07,000
And normally that starts
on the wedding night!

33
00:01:08,633 --> 00:01:10,133
You ready, Issei...?

34
00:01:10,166 --> 00:01:11,666
Come and get me.

35
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,400
You may now kiss the bride.

36
00:01:17,666 --> 00:01:19,333
I get to kiss her?!

37
00:01:19,366 --> 00:01:22,500
This is where your wet dream
ends, you little pervert.

38
00:01:22,533 --> 00:01:25,666
Hey, I've heard
that voice before.

39
00:01:26,133 --> 00:01:27,266
You have.

40
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,733
After all, I am inside you.

41
00:01:29,766 --> 00:01:30,733
You, what?

42
00:01:30,766 --> 00:01:33,400
Why ask a question when
you know the answer...?

43
00:01:33,433 --> 00:01:36,366
I've been speaking
to you for a long time...

44
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,166
Perhaps my voice
never reached you

45
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,666
because you've been
too weak to hear me.

46
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,600
You're not making any
sense, voice in my head!

47
00:01:43,633 --> 00:01:46,333
I merely wanted to
say hello to my partner,

48
00:01:46,366 --> 00:01:47,766
the one I shall be
fighting alongside

49
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,466
from this moment forward.

50
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,166
Partner?

51
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,433
I still don't know who you are.

52
00:01:52,466 --> 00:01:53,733
Quit being dramatic...

53
00:01:53,766 --> 00:01:58,266
You know exactly who I am.

54
00:03:48,354 --> 00:03:49,887
What's wrong with
you, man; you tired?

55
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,720
Yeah...

56
00:03:50,754 --> 00:03:52,420
I had a weird dream
that kept me up

57
00:03:52,454 --> 00:03:53,920
like almost the whole night.

58
00:03:53,954 --> 00:03:54,987
If you're talking
about a wet dream,

59
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:56,720
start spilling right now!

60
00:03:56,754 --> 00:03:57,754
Well, it wasn't.

61
00:03:57,787 --> 00:03:58,720
Oh, no.

62
00:03:58,754 --> 00:03:59,954
I'm sorry; I would've
helped had I known.

63
00:03:59,987 --> 00:04:03,454
Although, now it makes more
sense why you slept in so late.

64
00:04:03,487 --> 00:04:04,687
Oh yeah, hey,
I meant to thank you

65
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,520
for coming in to
wake me up this morning.

66
00:04:06,554 --> 00:04:07,454
What?

67
00:04:07,487 --> 00:04:09,420
Wait your morning
wake up call is Asia?!

68
00:04:09,454 --> 00:04:10,320
Whoa.

69
00:04:10,354 --> 00:04:11,887
We live together,
so it's no biggie...

70
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:12,854
I mean, dude...

71
00:04:12,887 --> 00:04:14,487
We're in each other's
rooms all the time.

72
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,620
Issei's so funny!

73
00:04:15,654 --> 00:04:17,920
He's always wandering in
accidentally while I'm changing!

74
00:04:17,954 --> 00:04:18,854
Shit.

75
00:04:18,887 --> 00:04:20,387
Probl'y serves you
breakfast in bed, too!

76
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:21,887
What am I supposed to do, huh?

77
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,720
Her French toast rules!

78
00:04:23,754 --> 00:04:24,620
Oh, stop...!

79
00:04:24,654 --> 00:04:26,754
You're making me blush.

80
00:04:26,787 --> 00:04:27,587
Why are all these hot girls

81
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:29,420
throwing themselves
at this guy?!

82
00:04:29,454 --> 00:04:30,520
It doesn't make any sense;

83
00:04:30,554 --> 00:04:32,620
it's like they haven't
seen his face.

84
00:04:32,654 --> 00:04:33,487
My good man...

85
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,320
I don't think
it would hurt anything

86
00:04:34,354 --> 00:04:35,320
if you spread
the wealth a little

87
00:04:35,354 --> 00:04:38,020
and introduced us to one
or two of your ladies...

88
00:04:38,054 --> 00:04:38,954
Oh, great one!

89
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:40,020
Do this for us!.

90
00:04:40,054 --> 00:04:41,887
Only you have the power!

91
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,754
I don't know what
to tell you, man.

92
00:04:43,787 --> 00:04:45,854
It's not like I can
say they're all devils.

93
00:04:45,887 --> 00:04:47,554
If you set me up
with an introduction,

94
00:04:47,587 --> 00:04:50,654
I swear you will be
rewarded accordingly.

95
00:04:50,687 --> 00:04:52,787
Uh... Accordingly
like what exactly?

96
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:53,654
Well...

97
00:04:53,687 --> 00:04:54,620
Tell me...

98
00:04:54,654 --> 00:04:56,620
How does a VIP room sound?

99
00:04:56,654 --> 00:04:57,620
We can work something out!

100
00:04:57,654 --> 00:05:00,887
I do know someone who's
pretty... interesting.

101
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,854
You mean it?!

102
00:05:01,887 --> 00:05:03,754
And we did talk about
meeting up today...

103
00:05:03,787 --> 00:05:04,754
Oh shit!

104
00:05:04,787 --> 00:05:06,620
And possibly having some
of my friends join us.

105
00:05:06,654 --> 00:05:07,520
You the man!

106
00:05:07,554 --> 00:05:08,420
So what's she like?

107
00:05:08,454 --> 00:05:09,120
Well...

108
00:05:09,154 --> 00:05:10,620
I'd definitely say a virgin...

109
00:05:10,654 --> 00:05:11,920
...no doubt about that.

110
00:05:11,954 --> 00:05:12,887
A virgin...?!

111
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,887
That's right, son!

112
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,687
Awesome.

113
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,687
Tell us her name.

114
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,487
Miltan.

115
00:05:22,387 --> 00:05:23,320
Oh, hell yeah.

116
00:05:23,354 --> 00:05:24,687
We've had lots of nip action,

117
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,854
but today might be the beev day.

118
00:05:26,887 --> 00:05:28,354
So, tell me, how do you like

119
00:05:28,387 --> 00:05:31,554
the ultra-VIP lounge
I discovered, Mister Hyodo?

120
00:05:31,587 --> 00:05:33,287
It's literally the tits...

121
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,520
Whoa... Koneko?

122
00:05:35,554 --> 00:05:36,920
Is she gonna strip, too...?

123
00:05:36,954 --> 00:05:37,920
Oh, please turn around.

124
00:05:37,954 --> 00:05:39,587
Please turn around.

125
00:05:40,954 --> 00:05:43,287
Saving to cranial memory.

126
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,720
HD boobie backup complete!

127
00:05:49,687 --> 00:05:50,887
She knows we're here...

128
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:58,687
This could be bad.

129
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,520
Hey guys... Are you all right?

130
00:06:01,587 --> 00:06:03,420
What's up, Koneko...?

131
00:06:03,454 --> 00:06:06,520
Fancy seeing you here.

132
00:06:06,554 --> 00:06:08,320
Bout to wish you hadn't.

133
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:13,554
Owie.

134
00:06:13,587 --> 00:06:14,520
This looks bad...

135
00:06:14,554 --> 00:06:15,854
...just gimmie a second.

136
00:06:15,887 --> 00:06:17,520
No need to rush, Asia.

137
00:06:17,554 --> 00:06:20,054
I don't understand how
you can be such a boy.

138
00:06:20,087 --> 00:06:21,220
What?

139
00:06:21,254 --> 00:06:22,720
My friends invited me to go;
I didn't want to be rude.

140
00:06:22,754 --> 00:06:23,720
I can help out...!

141
00:06:23,754 --> 00:06:25,620
If it's that important
for you to see nudity...

142
00:06:25,654 --> 00:06:26,820
Look at me!

143
00:06:26,854 --> 00:06:27,820
No!!! Stop, Asia.

144
00:06:27,854 --> 00:06:29,420
You've got me all wrong!

145
00:06:29,454 --> 00:06:31,287
She's just trying to help...

146
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,854
You know all you have to do is
ask, and I'll show you anything.

147
00:06:33,887 --> 00:06:34,787
What? Seriously?

148
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:37,554
Of course, you've
already seen me naked...

149
00:06:37,587 --> 00:06:38,454
A lot.

150
00:06:38,487 --> 00:06:39,254
Yeah...

151
00:06:39,287 --> 00:06:41,554
But it's not like
it gets boring.

152
00:06:41,587 --> 00:06:44,420
Oh! Issei!

153
00:06:44,454 --> 00:06:45,787
I mean! No! I was just saying!

154
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:48,487
But... I'd rather see you naked!

155
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,654
I'm sorry, but
I really don't like it

156
00:06:49,687 --> 00:06:51,720
when you're face
gets flirty like that.

157
00:06:51,754 --> 00:06:52,954
Flirty like what?

158
00:06:52,987 --> 00:06:54,854
This is just how my face looks.

159
00:06:55,787 --> 00:06:58,520
Don't you think it's funny...

160
00:06:58,554 --> 00:06:59,954
You know, the
reviews our clients give

161
00:06:59,987 --> 00:07:01,720
about Issei are pretty positive.

162
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:03,820
They say stuff like,
"It was so fun"...

163
00:07:03,854 --> 00:07:05,687
Or "I had a great
time with this guy!

164
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,287
Thanks for sending him to me!"

165
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,587
Yet, out of all of them,

166
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:11,420
he still hasn't gotten
a single pact signed.

167
00:07:11,454 --> 00:07:12,920
Heh. Oh well.

168
00:07:12,954 --> 00:07:16,420
At least he's really good
at hanging out, right?

169
00:07:16,454 --> 00:07:17,987
As a devil, he's
a massive failure...

170
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:21,354
But, at the same time, the
clients seem to adore him...

171
00:07:21,387 --> 00:07:23,920
No idea what to make
of it, but there ya go.

172
00:07:23,954 --> 00:07:25,654
Interesting.

173
00:07:25,687 --> 00:07:27,787
Still though, in his
own way, he's trying.

174
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:30,320
But that's not enough.

175
00:07:30,354 --> 00:07:32,287
Considering what
happened with the familiars,

176
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:35,487
I'm afraid his inability to get
a pact might make him stumble

177
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,554
and lose confidence...

178
00:07:37,587 --> 00:07:39,620
I must focus on him...

179
00:07:39,654 --> 00:07:42,520
He needs me more
now than ever before.

180
00:07:42,554 --> 00:07:45,787
Well, that is certainly
assertive of you, isn't it?

181
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,887
Is there a point
you're trying to make?

182
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:52,287
Just remarking that your style
is normally more laissez faire.

183
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:56,287
I find this commitment you have
to him fascinating, that's all.

184
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,420
Do you think there...
might be more to it?

185
00:07:59,454 --> 00:08:01,687
Akeno, it's not a bad thing
to have my best friend

186
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:05,354
worry about me, but this
is my own problem.

187
00:08:05,387 --> 00:08:09,287
And I am still the president
of this club... am I not?

188
00:08:09,854 --> 00:08:11,854
Yes, President...

189
00:08:16,054 --> 00:08:18,020
If you don't mind,
I'd like to head home now.

190
00:08:18,054 --> 00:08:18,987
That's fine...

191
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:20,887
I'll just see you tomorrow then.

192
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:45,287
Well, I guess Koneko
officially hates me.

193
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,887
Oh man, why do I have
to be such an asshole?

194
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,887
Hold on, I can't beat myself up!

195
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,687
I mean, I'm gonna be
king of the harems one day!

196
00:08:53,454 --> 00:08:55,587
I bet a quick bath'll
make me feel better.

197
00:08:58,954 --> 00:09:00,687
Doh!

198
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:04,454
Crap! Why am I
screaming like a girl?

199
00:09:04,487 --> 00:09:05,354
'Scuse me...

200
00:09:05,387 --> 00:09:06,887
Sorry about my penis.

201
00:09:10,054 --> 00:09:10,820
Um...

202
00:09:10,854 --> 00:09:12,720
I'm so sorry...

203
00:09:12,754 --> 00:09:16,787
I've... never seen...
a mans, um...

204
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:19,820
you know... thing before...

205
00:09:19,854 --> 00:09:21,487
I'm all aflutter now...

206
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,354
I'm sorry.

207
00:09:22,387 --> 00:09:23,854
No; it's my fault...

208
00:09:23,887 --> 00:09:25,654
I wasn't paying attention
to what I was doing,

209
00:09:25,687 --> 00:09:28,020
and I didn't realize
you were in here...

210
00:09:28,054 --> 00:09:29,720
I'm the one's who's sorry.

211
00:09:30,887 --> 00:09:33,854
Well... should we
make the most of it?

212
00:09:33,887 --> 00:09:35,820
I'm not sure what
you mean by that...

213
00:09:35,854 --> 00:09:36,887
I should stay?

214
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,820
I'm sure you've
heard it before...

215
00:09:38,854 --> 00:09:40,020
They say taking a
bath together

216
00:09:40,054 --> 00:09:42,320
can bring people
like a lot closer.

217
00:09:42,354 --> 00:09:43,020
They do?

218
00:09:43,054 --> 00:09:44,554
They do...

219
00:09:44,587 --> 00:09:47,454
Yeah, by interacting during
a bath, you're supposed

220
00:09:47,487 --> 00:09:50,354
to like, understand each
other or something.

221
00:09:50,387 --> 00:09:51,487
What does she want
to understand?

222
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,587
Whether I'm a
shower or a grower?

223
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:55,887
I just want...

224
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,420
to understand you...

225
00:09:57,454 --> 00:09:58,954
on a deeper level.

226
00:09:58,987 --> 00:10:01,454
Besides, you like
seeing people naked,

227
00:10:01,487 --> 00:10:03,420
and I could be one
of those people.

228
00:10:03,454 --> 00:10:04,287
Oh no...!

229
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,620
Keep it together Issei...

230
00:10:05,654 --> 00:10:07,754
Keep your crap together!

231
00:10:12,654 --> 00:10:13,787
Listen, Asia...

232
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:16,054
Being naked together
is complicated...

233
00:10:16,087 --> 00:10:17,654
I mean, if a dude gets
in the tub with you,

234
00:10:17,687 --> 00:10:20,420
that might not be the best
time to get to know him.

235
00:10:20,454 --> 00:10:22,287
Hey, Asia, I've got your towels;

236
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,820
I'm just gonna leave
them right here.

237
00:10:26,854 --> 00:10:29,287
I am not a sex fiend;
I am not a perv...

238
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:32,287
That being said, I still need
to protect Asia from myself.

239
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,454
I might be living with her,

240
00:10:33,487 --> 00:10:35,987
but dear Lord, keep me from
thinking about her naked.

241
00:10:37,054 --> 00:10:38,254
Ow...!

242
00:10:38,287 --> 00:10:39,520
What the hell was that for,
it wasn't even a real prayer!

243
00:10:39,554 --> 00:10:43,020
I swear I was doing the whole
taking your name in vain thing.

244
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,887
A magic circle?

245
00:10:50,387 --> 00:10:51,520
Rias?

246
00:10:51,554 --> 00:10:52,387
It was an accident,

247
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:54,854
I kept my eyes
closed the whole time.

248
00:10:54,887 --> 00:10:56,887
Wait. Is everything okay?

249
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,287
Issei...

250
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,020
Please...

251
00:10:59,054 --> 00:11:00,887
You have to take me.

252
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:03,487
Pardon?

253
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,554
I need you to
take my virginity...

254
00:11:05,587 --> 00:11:07,987
And I need you to do it now.

255
00:11:22,955 --> 00:11:23,822
Okay...

256
00:11:23,855 --> 00:11:25,189
This is happening...

257
00:11:25,222 --> 00:11:28,122
She really wants her
first time to be with me...?

258
00:11:28,155 --> 00:11:30,155
Pro'lly cuz I'm such a stud...!

259
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:32,722
Wait! Is this one of those
times I'm supposed to say no?

260
00:11:32,755 --> 00:11:33,889
Am I not good enough...?

261
00:11:33,922 --> 00:11:35,022
Do you not want to?

262
00:11:35,055 --> 00:11:35,689
No, you're great!

263
00:11:35,722 --> 00:11:36,489
You're amazing!

264
00:11:36,522 --> 00:11:38,022
I've given this
a lot of thought,

265
00:11:38,055 --> 00:11:40,189
and there's just no other way.

266
00:11:40,222 --> 00:11:42,622
Whaddaya mean no other way?

267
00:11:42,655 --> 00:11:46,089
Once it becomes known that I
am ruined, I'll finally be free.

268
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:48,455
You're seriously
lacking in most areas...

269
00:11:48,489 --> 00:11:50,422
so I'm trusting
in your potential.

270
00:11:50,455 --> 00:11:51,089
Uh...

271
00:11:51,122 --> 00:11:52,255
Thank you for that, I guess.

272
00:11:52,289 --> 00:11:57,422
Besides, what I want won't
take a lot of skill anyway.

273
00:12:00,689 --> 00:12:02,555
Uh... this is kinda
sudden, yeah?

274
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:03,755
You, too...?

275
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:05,689
I mean, you're a virgin, right?

276
00:12:05,722 --> 00:12:06,689
Uh huh.

277
00:12:06,722 --> 00:12:09,189
Neither of us may have
much experience with it,

278
00:12:09,222 --> 00:12:13,422
but I'm sure we'll figure
something out that works .

279
00:12:13,822 --> 00:12:14,989
It's okay...

280
00:12:15,022 --> 00:12:21,522
All you have to do is put
yours into mine, right there.

281
00:12:21,555 --> 00:12:23,589
Let's start here...

282
00:12:23,622 --> 00:12:26,589
I'm a little nervous
about it myself.

283
00:12:26,622 --> 00:12:27,155
Yeah.

284
00:12:27,189 --> 00:12:29,022
I guess I'm kinda, yeah.

285
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:31,422
I know I gave you
a time limit before,

286
00:12:31,455 --> 00:12:33,422
but take as much
time as you want now.

287
00:12:33,455 --> 00:12:34,489
Uhh...

288
00:12:34,522 --> 00:12:36,789
I'm not sure if this
is a good idea.

289
00:12:36,822 --> 00:12:40,122
Does that mean you're
choosing to deny me?

290
00:12:40,155 --> 00:12:52,589
No, I... Rias!

291
00:12:52,622 --> 00:12:57,922
I had a feeling
I'd get here too late.

292
00:12:57,955 --> 00:13:00,555
Really, Rias, you're
here with this lowborn...?

293
00:13:00,589 --> 00:13:01,922
You realize Sir Zechs is going

294
00:13:01,955 --> 00:13:03,889
to be terribly
disappointed in you.

295
00:13:03,922 --> 00:13:05,589
Um, who's Sir Zechs?

296
00:13:05,622 --> 00:13:07,655
She means my older brother.

297
00:13:07,689 --> 00:13:09,155
You have an older brother?

298
00:13:09,189 --> 00:13:11,989
My virtue is mine
to do with as I please...

299
00:13:12,022 --> 00:13:14,822
How is it wrong for me to
give it to whomever I want...?

300
00:13:14,855 --> 00:13:17,655
And another thing!

301
00:13:17,689 --> 00:13:19,155
I will not allow anyone

302
00:13:19,189 --> 00:13:21,589
to call one of my honored
servants a lowborn...

303
00:13:21,622 --> 00:13:24,122
I don't care if you're
my brother's queen or not.

304
00:13:27,655 --> 00:13:29,622
Noted.

305
00:13:29,655 --> 00:13:31,055
But... think...

306
00:13:31,089 --> 00:13:34,655
You... are the
next head of Gremory.

307
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:37,155
Have some respect for yourself.

308
00:13:39,889 --> 00:13:41,689
Pardon the interruption...

309
00:13:41,722 --> 00:13:42,789
My name is Grayfia

310
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:45,722
and I am also in the service
of the Gremory family...

311
00:13:45,755 --> 00:13:46,889
We'll get out of your way...

312
00:13:46,922 --> 00:13:47,589
Now.

313
00:13:47,622 --> 00:13:48,289
Yeah, okay.

314
00:13:48,322 --> 00:13:50,622
Is every devil chick stupid hot?

315
00:13:54,022 --> 00:13:55,722
I'm so sorry, Issei...

316
00:13:55,755 --> 00:13:58,122
I haven't been in my
right mind tonight...

317
00:13:58,155 --> 00:14:00,689
Let's just forget about this?

318
00:14:00,722 --> 00:14:02,455
Sure thing.

319
00:14:02,489 --> 00:14:03,122
Issei...?

320
00:14:03,155 --> 00:14:04,922
You mean this is him?

321
00:14:04,955 --> 00:14:07,755
Yes; he is my pawn.

322
00:14:07,789 --> 00:14:10,155
The one who's bearing
the Boosted Gear

323
00:14:10,189 --> 00:14:12,589
and is possessed by
the Dragon emperor...

324
00:14:12,622 --> 00:14:13,722
...is this small boy?

325
00:14:13,755 --> 00:14:15,422
Yeah, uh... tada.

326
00:14:15,455 --> 00:14:18,189
I will listen to what you have
to say at my headquarters...

327
00:14:18,222 --> 00:14:20,755
You won't mind
if Akeno joins us?

328
00:14:20,789 --> 00:14:22,089
The Priestess of Thunder?

329
00:14:22,122 --> 00:14:23,622
Of course I don't mind...

330
00:14:23,655 --> 00:14:25,622
In fact, it's only
proper for a noble devil

331
00:14:25,655 --> 00:14:29,455
to have her queen by her
side in times like these.

332
00:14:31,522 --> 00:14:33,589
Forgive me for
putting you out... please.

333
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:34,522
Yeah, no problem...

334
00:14:34,555 --> 00:14:36,155
Don't worry.

335
00:14:39,222 --> 00:14:41,855
Then I suppose
I should excuse myself.

336
00:14:49,689 --> 00:14:51,022
I still can't
get over last night

337
00:14:51,055 --> 00:14:53,122
with Rias and
that Grayfia lady...

338
00:14:53,155 --> 00:14:55,989
I wonder what
that was all about.

339
00:14:57,189 --> 00:14:58,789
Rot in hell, traitor!

340
00:14:58,822 --> 00:14:59,889
Sorry?

341
00:14:59,922 --> 00:15:01,722
Isn't it a little early for
you guys to be so mad?

342
00:15:01,755 --> 00:15:03,022
Imma kill you, bitch!

343
00:15:03,055 --> 00:15:04,889
Miltan a girl like hell, son!.

344
00:15:04,922 --> 00:15:07,455
I know Andre the Giant
when I see that shit dangle!

345
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:09,622
Not to mention he was
dressed up like a princess...!

346
00:15:09,655 --> 00:15:11,422
He asked if we were magical!

347
00:15:11,455 --> 00:15:12,522
Come on...

348
00:15:12,555 --> 00:15:14,055
It's not my fault you
didn't want a piece'a that.

349
00:15:14,089 --> 00:15:15,322
How you gonna try and
hook us up with a dude?!

350
00:15:15,355 --> 00:15:18,822
He was having a party for guys
who dress like little girls...

351
00:15:18,855 --> 00:15:21,622
Have you ever been in a room
full of magical princess tanks?

352
00:15:21,655 --> 00:15:22,422
It's not pretty!

353
00:15:22,455 --> 00:15:24,122
I never been so
scared in my life!

354
00:15:24,155 --> 00:15:25,622
That was cold, jack...

355
00:15:25,655 --> 00:15:26,989
We thought we were dead.

356
00:15:27,022 --> 00:15:27,989
Why you gotta play us?

357
00:15:28,022 --> 00:15:29,689
You threw us into some
twisted ass shit, man!!

358
00:15:29,722 --> 00:15:30,989
Ain't right!

359
00:15:32,689 --> 00:15:35,422
You're right; I think
something is bugging her.

360
00:15:35,455 --> 00:15:38,689
If I had to guess, I'd say
it's House of Gremory drama.

361
00:15:38,722 --> 00:15:41,422
You think Akeno might know
what's going on there?

362
00:15:41,455 --> 00:15:44,455
She is her right hand lady, so
if anyone would, it's her.

363
00:15:46,089 --> 00:15:46,955
What is it?

364
00:15:46,989 --> 00:15:48,189
Well... There is one thing

365
00:15:48,222 --> 00:15:50,022
I can think of that
would upset her...

366
00:15:50,055 --> 00:15:51,855
And it's pretty bad news.

367
00:15:52,989 --> 00:15:54,889
Sup?

368
00:15:54,922 --> 00:15:55,922
Miss Grayfia.

369
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,722
Well, everyone's here...

370
00:15:57,755 --> 00:15:58,355
Good...

371
00:15:58,389 --> 00:15:59,789
My lady if you don't mind,

372
00:15:59,822 --> 00:16:02,922
may I have your
permission to speak openly?

373
00:16:02,955 --> 00:16:04,922
Let's hear her out...

374
00:16:11,622 --> 00:16:13,389
Phoenix.

375
00:16:16,022 --> 00:16:19,822
And Riser has arrived
in the human realm.

376
00:16:19,855 --> 00:16:21,455
I've come all this
way to see you...

377
00:16:21,489 --> 00:16:23,989
My beloved Rias.

378
00:16:24,022 --> 00:16:25,489
Okay, who's this douche?

379
00:16:25,522 --> 00:16:27,822
This gentleman is
Lord Riser Phoenix...

380
00:16:27,855 --> 00:16:29,989
He is a pureblooded
devil of noble birth...

381
00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:32,189
third heir in line to
the House of Phoenix.

382
00:16:32,222 --> 00:16:33,455
And that means... what?

383
00:16:33,489 --> 00:16:37,089
He is also fiancé to the next
head of the House of Gremory...

384
00:16:37,122 --> 00:16:38,455
Fiancé to what...?

385
00:16:38,489 --> 00:16:39,855
You're joking, right?

386
00:16:39,889 --> 00:16:40,755
I am not...

387
00:16:40,789 --> 00:16:41,655
Lady Rias has been engaged

388
00:16:41,689 --> 00:16:43,922
to Lord Riser for
quite some time now.

389
00:16:43,955 --> 00:16:47,022
They're getting married?!

390
00:16:50,141 --> 00:16:51,241
Lovely...

391
00:16:51,275 --> 00:16:55,075
the tea prepared by my
Rias' queen is most delicious.

392
00:16:55,108 --> 00:16:57,008
Thank you for
the compliment, sir.

393
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:58,475
What a fucking asshole...!

394
00:16:58,508 --> 00:17:01,241
No way twat face
is gonna marry Rias.

395
00:17:05,175 --> 00:17:07,075
That's enough, Riser.

396
00:17:07,108 --> 00:17:07,741
Let it go...

397
00:17:07,775 --> 00:17:09,408
Why don't you understand...?

398
00:17:09,441 --> 00:17:12,208
I have no intention
of ever marrying you.

399
00:17:12,241 --> 00:17:13,575
But, my darling...

400
00:17:13,608 --> 00:17:16,041
Riser believes your
family's circumstances

401
00:17:16,075 --> 00:17:19,241
are still such that you
cannot afford to be so selfish.

402
00:17:19,275 --> 00:17:21,475
I will not bring
my family to ruin...

403
00:17:21,508 --> 00:17:24,341
I have no intention of denying
you your right to our name...

404
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:27,275
However, let me be clear,
my husband will be my choice.

405
00:17:27,308 --> 00:17:31,175
Remember, it's imperative for
devils to remain pureblood...

406
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:34,641
We're still recovering our
numbers from the last war.

407
00:17:34,675 --> 00:17:37,075
Both your father and
Sir Zechs decided on

408
00:17:37,108 --> 00:17:39,708
this arrangement with
the future of devils in mind.

409
00:17:39,741 --> 00:17:41,675
My father, my brother,
and my whole clan

410
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:44,675
made this decision because
they are in too great a rush.

411
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:46,141
For the final time...

412
00:17:46,175 --> 00:17:48,008
Riser...

413
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:50,541
I will not marry you.

414
00:17:50,575 --> 00:17:52,475
For the final time, Rias...

415
00:17:52,508 --> 00:17:55,708
Riser bears the reputation
of the House of Phoenix...

416
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:59,275
Besmirching our good
name is unacceptable.

417
00:18:00,241 --> 00:18:01,408
Hey!

418
00:18:01,441 --> 00:18:02,608
Riser doesn't care if he has

419
00:18:02,641 --> 00:18:05,108
to incinerate
everyone in this room...

420
00:18:05,141 --> 00:18:08,108
You will return to
the underworld with me.

421
00:18:08,141 --> 00:18:11,075
There's no need
for incineration.

422
00:18:11,108 --> 00:18:13,641
My lady Rias, Lord Riser...

423
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:16,208
As you know, I am here
by order of Sir Zechs...

424
00:18:16,241 --> 00:18:17,075
Which means...

425
00:18:17,108 --> 00:18:20,208
There will be
no disruption of peace.

426
00:18:20,608 --> 00:18:22,175
When told such an ominous thing

427
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:24,541
by one who is known
as the ultimate queen...

428
00:18:24,575 --> 00:18:27,275
Even Riser can
become somewhat fearful.

429
00:18:27,308 --> 00:18:29,075
My master anticipated
there would be

430
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:31,041
a conflict of some sort...

431
00:18:31,075 --> 00:18:33,375
As such, he has
assigned me a last resort,

432
00:18:33,408 --> 00:18:35,275
should communication break down.

433
00:18:35,308 --> 00:18:36,741
Yes, of course he did...

434
00:18:36,775 --> 00:18:38,541
Would you care to be
a little more specific?

435
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:40,208
If my lady insists on putting

436
00:18:40,241 --> 00:18:43,208
her personal preferences
above those of her family...

437
00:18:43,241 --> 00:18:47,075
She is to settle this via a
Rating Game with Lord Riser.

438
00:18:47,108 --> 00:18:48,641
Wait, what's a rating game...?

439
00:18:48,675 --> 00:18:50,608
That sounds familiar.

440
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:52,308
Oh yeah...

441
00:18:52,341 --> 00:18:54,675
Sona mentioned something
like that before, didn't she?

442
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:57,075
It's a game noble devils
play with each other...

443
00:18:57,108 --> 00:18:59,008
Long story short, they
and their servants compete

444
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:00,675
in battle to determine who wins.

445
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:01,741
Like the chess thing?

446
00:19:01,775 --> 00:19:04,575
Exactly, it's the reason
we have individual powers

447
00:19:04,608 --> 00:19:07,441
that are inspired by
what we call evil pieces...

448
00:19:07,475 --> 00:19:09,375
In order to play
the Rating Game.

449
00:19:09,408 --> 00:19:11,575
Okay, that's good to know.

450
00:19:12,075 --> 00:19:14,275
Riser has played through
numerous Rating games,

451
00:19:14,308 --> 00:19:16,575
and has scored
several wins for himself...

452
00:19:16,608 --> 00:19:18,708
Unfortunately,
my inexperienced bride

453
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:22,175
has never even qualified
for an official game.

454
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:24,708
He knows only mature devils
are allowed to participate,

455
00:19:24,741 --> 00:19:26,575
so it's not as if she's
had much opportunity.

456
00:19:26,608 --> 00:19:28,541
So... you're saying
we're at a disadvantage?

457
00:19:28,575 --> 00:19:31,241
We've got more to
worry about than that.

458
00:19:31,275 --> 00:19:33,041
Rias, I have to ask...

459
00:19:33,075 --> 00:19:36,041
is this adorable group the
extent of your servants?

460
00:19:36,075 --> 00:19:37,508
They're all you have?

461
00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:39,341
And so what if they are?

462
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:50,608
Riser has fifteen pieces...

463
00:19:50,641 --> 00:19:52,208
In other words...

464
00:19:52,241 --> 00:19:55,241
I have a complete set.

465
00:19:58,175 --> 00:19:59,141
Fifteen...

466
00:19:59,175 --> 00:20:00,341
And they're all hot as hell...

467
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:01,275
Damn it!

468
00:20:01,308 --> 00:20:03,575
Issei hates him so much.

469
00:20:04,408 --> 00:20:07,241
Why can't I be this guy!

470
00:20:07,275 --> 00:20:10,208
My dear, why is your
servant looking at me

471
00:20:10,241 --> 00:20:13,208
and weeping uncontrollably?

472
00:20:13,241 --> 00:20:15,175
Because his dream
is to have a harem.

473
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:17,641
Ew, what a total barbarian.

474
00:20:17,675 --> 00:20:19,375
Oh, is that so...?

475
00:20:19,408 --> 00:20:20,641
Yubelluna...

476
00:20:20,675 --> 00:20:22,441
Yes... my lord?

477
00:20:32,608 --> 00:20:34,375
Damn!

478
00:20:36,408 --> 00:20:39,308
No matter how long you live,
you'll never have what I do...

479
00:20:39,341 --> 00:20:41,241
You're just a lower-class devil.

480
00:20:41,275 --> 00:20:42,175
Shut up!.

481
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:44,041
Once I stop sucking
at this devil shit,

482
00:20:44,075 --> 00:20:46,608
I'll get all the ladies I want,
you stupid Phoenix breath!

483
00:20:46,641 --> 00:20:49,141
Or should I say Pee-nix breath!

484
00:20:49,175 --> 00:20:50,108
How dare you...

485
00:20:50,141 --> 00:20:51,675
It would be best if
you remember your place

486
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,375
when you speak to me.

487
00:20:53,408 --> 00:20:54,541
Screw you!

488
00:20:54,575 --> 00:20:55,675
The only person in this room
I need to impress is Rias!

489
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:57,675
Calm down, that's enough.

490
00:20:57,708 --> 00:21:00,108
I don't give a shit
what you think of me!

491
00:21:00,608 --> 00:21:01,441
Issei...?

492
00:21:01,475 --> 00:21:03,541
We don't need to play
some damn game!.

493
00:21:03,575 --> 00:21:05,708
I'll kick your ass
right here, right now!

494
00:21:05,741 --> 00:21:06,641
Issei, no!

495
00:21:06,675 --> 00:21:07,741
Mira.

496
00:21:09,808 --> 00:21:11,508
What's she supposed to do?

497
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:13,008
She's tiny.

498
00:21:19,608 --> 00:21:20,641
Oh no, he's hurt!

499
00:21:20,675 --> 00:21:22,341
Issei!

500
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:23,475
I'm here.

501
00:21:23,508 --> 00:21:25,408
Please talk to me,
are you all right?

502
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:28,341
I'm good...

503
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:29,141
Yeah...

504
00:21:29,175 --> 00:21:31,475
Don't worry about me.

505
00:21:34,308 --> 00:21:35,275
Ha...!

506
00:21:35,308 --> 00:21:37,608
Imagine, the bearer of
the brutal Boosted Gear

507
00:21:37,641 --> 00:21:40,175
being so unbelievably worthless.

508
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:42,641
What a tragedy for you, darling.

509
00:21:42,675 --> 00:21:43,608
Grayfia...

510
00:21:43,641 --> 00:21:47,275
Tell my brother I agree
to the Rating Game.

511
00:21:49,408 --> 00:21:51,608
I will inform him immediately.

512
00:21:53,108 --> 00:21:55,275
Riser...?

513
00:21:56,508 --> 00:21:59,141
Believe me when I say
we will annihilate you!

514
00:21:59,175 --> 00:22:02,375
I look forward to it, dear.

515
00:22:02,408 --> 00:22:04,508
Riser will see you at the game.

516
00:22:15,175 --> 00:22:16,641
Issei...

517
00:23:48,641 --> 00:23:50,341
Now, Lesson Four!

518
00:23:50,375 --> 00:23:51,608
Because you're a devil.

519
00:23:51,641 --> 00:23:53,375
You're one of us now, Asia.

520
00:23:53,408 --> 00:23:55,475
You should write it down.

521
00:23:55,708 --> 00:23:58,375
Probably not a good idea.

522
00:23:58,408 --> 00:24:00,608
I'm like a Sacred
Gear Super Freak!

523
00:24:00,641 --> 00:24:02,508
You're a pervert.
