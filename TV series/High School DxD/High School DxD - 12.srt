1
00:00:18,266 --> 00:00:19,433
Who's there?

2
00:00:19,466 --> 00:00:22,533
The power you currently possess
is not of your own making.

3
00:00:22,566 --> 00:00:23,433
Wait a minute.

4
00:00:23,466 --> 00:00:24,800
I know that voice.

5
00:00:24,833 --> 00:00:25,933
No measure of hard work

6
00:00:25,966 --> 00:00:29,400
and training could give
someone that amount of strength.

7
00:00:29,433 --> 00:00:32,133
Oh yeah, I remember,
you were in my dream before.

8
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:33,433
What makes you extraordinary

9
00:00:33,466 --> 00:00:36,100
is the dragon
inside your soul...

10
00:00:36,133 --> 00:00:37,066
Do not humble yourself

11
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:39,700
with weakness or the
White One will laugh.

12
00:00:39,733 --> 00:00:41,100
The White One?

13
00:00:41,133 --> 00:00:42,800
In time, he will appear...

14
00:00:42,833 --> 00:00:46,700
It is your destiny to stand on
that field of battle and fight.

15
00:00:46,733 --> 00:00:48,633
But you must get stronger...

16
00:00:48,666 --> 00:00:52,566
If a sacrifice is made, a
boon will be given in return.

17
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,500
A gift of shared strength
in your moment of need...

18
00:00:55,533 --> 00:00:58,700
But first, show them
what a dragon is.

19
00:00:58,733 --> 00:01:00,333
What does that mean?

20
00:01:02,433 --> 00:01:04,266
I am the Welsh Dragon...

21
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:06,700
The Red Dragon Emperor, Ddraig.

22
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:07,500
Ddraig?

23
00:01:07,533 --> 00:01:10,366
I am what lives
in your left hand.

24
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,466
Rias.

25
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,500
I'm surprised you're awake.

26
00:01:21,533 --> 00:01:22,666
Miss Grayfia...

27
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:23,633
Hey...

28
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:26,166
What the hell happened,
how did I get here?

29
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,133
The battle ended shortly
after Lady Rias surrendered.

30
00:01:29,166 --> 00:01:30,133
We lost?

31
00:01:30,166 --> 00:01:31,366
I'm afraid so.

32
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,233
Lord Riser was
declared the victor.

33
00:01:33,266 --> 00:01:34,266
No way.

34
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,433
Are you sure?

35
00:01:35,466 --> 00:01:37,066
Yes.

36
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,200
But how...?

37
00:01:38,233 --> 00:01:40,066
There's no way Rias would
just give up like that...

38
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,300
She'd keep fighting
no matter what!

39
00:01:42,333 --> 00:01:43,633
Lord Riser was
going to kill you;

40
00:01:43,666 --> 00:01:46,133
she surrendered
to save your life.

41
00:01:46,166 --> 00:01:47,433
The game...

42
00:01:47,466 --> 00:01:49,633
The whole thing's one big blur.

43
00:01:49,666 --> 00:01:51,466
You didn't give up.

44
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:55,033
Every time he knocked you
down, you got right back up.

45
00:01:55,066 --> 00:01:56,166
It's fine...

46
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,233
Don't worry...

47
00:01:57,266 --> 00:01:58,333
I'm okay...

48
00:01:58,366 --> 00:02:00,200
You did your best.

49
00:02:00,233 --> 00:02:01,800
You made me proud...

50
00:02:01,833 --> 00:02:03,666
Thanks, Issei.

51
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,773
It's me...

52
00:02:06,806 --> 00:02:09,273
She did it because of me.

53
00:02:09,306 --> 00:02:10,506
This whole thing is my fault...

54
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:13,506
I tried so hard to beat him,
but I wasn't strong enough...

55
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:17,240
I failed and now Rias
might be Riser's forever.

56
00:02:17,273 --> 00:02:17,940
Wait...

57
00:02:17,973 --> 00:02:19,473
Where is everyone from my team?

58
00:02:19,506 --> 00:02:21,306
Lady Rias instructed Miss Asia

59
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:23,306
to stay here and
take care of you.

60
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,540
After all, you were
hurt pretty badly.

61
00:02:25,573 --> 00:02:27,440
The rest of them are
in the Underworld...

62
00:02:27,473 --> 00:02:29,873
Lady Rias wanted them with
her for what comes next.

63
00:02:29,906 --> 00:02:30,806
Underworld?

64
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,773
Yes.

65
00:02:31,806 --> 00:02:35,540
The engagement party
will be starting soon.

66
00:02:35,573 --> 00:02:36,573
Oh no.

67
00:02:36,606 --> 00:02:38,940
I understand that history
is not in my favor,

68
00:02:38,973 --> 00:02:41,440
and the idea of love
may just remain a dream...

69
00:02:41,473 --> 00:02:43,540
But it's a dream that
I'd like to try to keep.

70
00:02:43,573 --> 00:02:44,673
I'm sorry, Rias...

71
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:45,540
I failed.

72
00:02:45,573 --> 00:02:47,640
Strive to become
the mightiest pawn...

73
00:02:47,673 --> 00:02:49,840
I have complete
faith in your ability.

74
00:02:49,873 --> 00:02:52,873
Consider it an order,
my dear servant.

75
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:54,740
Now go get stronger, Issei...

76
00:02:54,773 --> 00:02:56,440
You can do it.

77
00:02:56,473 --> 00:02:59,606
I could've worked
harder, but it's too late.

78
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,706
I'm weak...

79
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:01,640
I'm so pathetic.

80
00:03:01,673 --> 00:03:03,540
She deserved better than me.

81
00:03:03,573 --> 00:03:04,606
Listen, Issei...

82
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,840
It's not your fault.

83
00:03:05,873 --> 00:03:09,406
Rias is abiding by the decisions
of the Gremory household...

84
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,673
Sadly...

85
00:03:10,706 --> 00:03:13,173
The outcome of the battle is the
way it was always meant to be.

86
00:03:13,206 --> 00:03:14,340
Even so...

87
00:03:14,373 --> 00:03:15,473
The thought of it...

88
00:03:15,506 --> 00:03:17,273
It makes me sick...

89
00:03:17,306 --> 00:03:19,640
I can't just sit here
and watch Rias suffer...

90
00:03:19,673 --> 00:03:20,773
She shouldn't be forced

91
00:03:20,806 --> 00:03:23,340
to accept a horrible life
she doesn't wanna live...!

92
00:03:23,373 --> 00:03:25,573
It's wrong!

93
00:03:26,273 --> 00:03:29,873
I can't let that
bastard take her!

94
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:33,906
You really are a
fascinating boy, Issei.

95
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:36,706
You're an open book and
a gentle soul, to be sure...

96
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:38,206
I've met a lot of
devils over the years,

97
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,873
but never one quite like you...

98
00:03:39,906 --> 00:03:40,773
When your mind's made up,

99
00:03:40,806 --> 00:03:42,840
there's nothing that
can slow you down.

100
00:03:42,873 --> 00:03:45,240
And I'm not the only
one who thinks so.

101
00:03:45,273 --> 00:03:47,573
Sir Zechs feels
the exact same way.

102
00:03:47,606 --> 00:03:48,806
What's that?

103
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:52,840
If you want, this can transport
you to the engagement party.

104
00:03:52,873 --> 00:03:55,273
Are you saying I should
go there and stop them?

105
00:03:55,306 --> 00:03:58,873
Sir Zechs gave me an
important message for you.

106
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:00,640
'If you want my
sister back, Issei,

107
00:04:00,673 --> 00:04:02,373
you'd better be
prepared to fight.'

108
00:04:02,406 --> 00:04:03,673
Yeah?

109
00:04:06,773 --> 00:04:08,206
Remember his warning.

110
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,173
If you decide to
stage a rescue attempt,

111
00:04:10,206 --> 00:04:13,640
it's your only option.

112
00:04:17,373 --> 00:04:20,140
I guess there's only
one thing to do then.

113
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:26,806
Issei, you're up!

114
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,173
Asia... What's the
matter you okay?

115
00:04:29,206 --> 00:04:30,040
Sorry...!

116
00:04:30,073 --> 00:04:31,840
I was just so
worried about you...!

117
00:04:31,873 --> 00:04:33,440
You were out so long...

118
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:36,340
I didn't know if you'd
ever open your eyes again!

119
00:04:36,373 --> 00:04:38,273
I was scared, Issei!

120
00:04:38,306 --> 00:04:39,406
I'm sorry...

121
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,206
I never meant to make you
worry about me like that.

122
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,473
No... Don't apologize.

123
00:04:43,506 --> 00:04:46,506
You're safe, and that's the only
thing that matters to me now.

124
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:47,873
Asia, listen to me.

125
00:04:47,906 --> 00:04:49,506
Okay.

126
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:52,673
I have to try and rescue Rias.

127
00:04:52,706 --> 00:04:53,473
Are you sure...?

128
00:04:53,506 --> 00:04:55,573
You think that's
that a good idea?

129
00:04:55,606 --> 00:04:56,573
Well...

130
00:04:56,606 --> 00:04:58,540
I know she'd try to rescue me.

131
00:04:58,573 --> 00:05:00,173
Then I'll come with you.

132
00:05:00,206 --> 00:05:01,340
You can't do that...

133
00:05:01,373 --> 00:05:03,873
Please... I need you
to stay here for me.

134
00:05:03,906 --> 00:05:05,106
No, I won't...

135
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:07,873
Let me come with you, I can
help you out if you get injured!

136
00:05:07,906 --> 00:05:10,173
I've gotten much better
at using my magic...!

137
00:05:10,206 --> 00:05:11,740
Don't make me
stay behind, Issei!

138
00:05:11,773 --> 00:05:12,406
Don't worry.

139
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,306
I won't do anything stupid.

140
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:15,306
Trust me, everything
will be all right.

141
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:17,406
Don't make a promise
you can't keep!

142
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,740
If something horrible
happens to you

143
00:05:18,773 --> 00:05:21,406
while you're away,
what am I supposed to do...?

144
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,373
I can't stand to
see you hurt again...

145
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:24,740
Oh, Issei, I don't know how

146
00:05:24,773 --> 00:05:27,506
I could bear it if
I wasn't there to help!

147
00:05:29,206 --> 00:05:30,506
I'm gonna be alright...

148
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:31,806
This is no big deal...

149
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,873
I mean hey.

150
00:05:32,906 --> 00:05:34,340
After everything
I've been through,

151
00:05:34,373 --> 00:05:36,406
I'm still in one
piece, aren't I?

152
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,840
If I let you go, you have
to promise me something.

153
00:05:38,873 --> 00:05:40,240
Anything.

154
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:41,240
No matter what...

155
00:05:41,273 --> 00:05:43,606
Promise me you'll bring
Rias back home with you.

156
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,273
You know I will...

157
00:05:45,306 --> 00:05:46,406
But first...

158
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,240
I need you to do me the
favor we talked about before.

159
00:05:51,573 --> 00:05:55,273
It's something no one else can
help me with but you... 'member?

160
00:05:55,306 --> 00:05:56,706
Yes, I remember...

161
00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:00,173
If it's important to you,
I'm happy to do it.

162
00:06:01,306 --> 00:06:03,273
Thanks, Asia.

163
00:06:03,306 --> 00:06:03,840
Hey...

164
00:06:03,873 --> 00:06:05,473
You can hear me right?

165
00:06:05,506 --> 00:06:06,406
Are you there...?

166
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,506
I need a word with you.

167
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:09,340
Come on...

168
00:06:09,373 --> 00:06:11,740
Show yourself, Dragon!

169
00:06:11,773 --> 00:06:13,306
I am here...

170
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,406
What is it you ask of me?

171
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,540
You and me...?

172
00:06:16,573 --> 00:06:18,206
Need to make a deal.

173
00:06:19,306 --> 00:06:20,506
This is an engagement party...?

174
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:22,940
So then why the hell
am I in a wedding dress?

175
00:06:22,973 --> 00:06:27,206
Because Riser wanted it.

176
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,506
No, Lord Riser, you mustn't...

177
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:29,706
Men aren't allowed in here.

178
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,240
Just a word with his lady

179
00:06:31,273 --> 00:06:33,306
and Riser will
be out momentarily.

180
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:34,473
Look at that dress.

181
00:06:34,506 --> 00:06:37,173
You really are a
beautiful bride, my love.

182
00:06:37,206 --> 00:06:39,540
I'm not a bride yet;
sorry to disappoint you.

183
00:06:39,573 --> 00:06:40,906
So what's with the dress?

184
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,373
'What's with the dress?'...

185
00:06:42,406 --> 00:06:43,873
I just want you to
make a good impression

186
00:06:43,906 --> 00:06:45,840
on our esteemed
guests, my dear...

187
00:06:45,873 --> 00:06:46,906
After all...

188
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,540
We need to
demonstrate to the world

189
00:06:48,573 --> 00:06:50,706
that our two houses
have joined together...

190
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:52,640
Right?

191
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:54,840
And don't worry,
you'll have a dress

192
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:57,806
even more stunning than that
one when the time comes...

193
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,540
Lord Riser's bride
will be adorned

194
00:06:59,573 --> 00:07:01,640
in a gown made
of flaming feathers.

195
00:07:01,673 --> 00:07:05,273
It's only fitting for a
lady of the House of Phoenix

196
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,873
A dress made of
flaming feathers...?

197
00:07:07,906 --> 00:07:10,473
I think I'd be better
off killing myself.

198
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:20,573
Issei. Issei!

199
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,273
Rias...

200
00:07:22,306 --> 00:07:25,373
Please... Will you forgive me?

201
00:07:25,406 --> 00:07:26,373
If it's the last thing I do,

202
00:07:26,406 --> 00:07:29,506
I swear I'm gonna make
sure Rias Gremory wins!

203
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:32,206
You haven't learned how
to use your magic correctly...

204
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,806
And you have virtually
no combat experience at all.

205
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,740
And yet you still risk
your life to rescue me...

206
00:07:39,773 --> 00:07:40,640
Issei...

207
00:07:40,673 --> 00:07:42,673
Such a silly boy.

208
00:07:43,706 --> 00:07:46,373
I'm so sorry...

209
00:07:46,406 --> 00:07:47,640
It's my fault...

210
00:07:47,673 --> 00:07:50,273
How could I let things
end up this way?

211
00:07:50,306 --> 00:07:51,740
You're so brave...

212
00:07:51,773 --> 00:07:53,340
So strong...

213
00:07:53,373 --> 00:07:54,606
And sweet...

214
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,906
Thank you for everything.

215
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:57,906
Issei.

216
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:58,740
Lady Rias...

217
00:07:58,773 --> 00:08:00,506
It's time.

218
00:08:04,606 --> 00:08:06,440
My incredibly
talented brother won

219
00:08:06,473 --> 00:08:08,806
himself a bride by
demolishing the Gremorys.

220
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,473
Of course I had
no doubt he was going

221
00:08:10,506 --> 00:08:11,473
to win from the beginning.

222
00:08:11,506 --> 00:08:12,773
But he had to keep it close

223
00:08:12,806 --> 00:08:14,673
so it wasn't a complete bore.

224
00:08:14,706 --> 00:08:15,840
She's delightful.

225
00:08:15,873 --> 00:08:18,773
Yes, the girl's got quite
a mouth on her, doesn't she?

226
00:08:18,806 --> 00:08:19,840
Sona, what's up?

227
00:08:19,873 --> 00:08:20,873
The outcome not withstanding,

228
00:08:20,906 --> 00:08:22,373
I thought it was a good match.

229
00:08:22,406 --> 00:08:23,240
Though...

230
00:08:23,273 --> 00:08:24,506
I wouldn't have complained

231
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:26,440
if the end result had
been a bit different.

232
00:08:26,473 --> 00:08:27,573
Thanks for the support,

233
00:08:27,606 --> 00:08:30,606
but I promise this thing
isn't even close to being over.

234
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:33,273
We'll get another shot
at them, I'm sure...

235
00:08:33,306 --> 00:08:35,506
Only next time, we'll
be ready for their tricks.

236
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:37,706
Yeah screw those d-bags.

237
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:42,673
Greetings renowned
devils of the underworld!

238
00:08:42,706 --> 00:08:44,406
On behalf of the
House of Phoenix...

239
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,506
Riser would like

240
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:48,506
to thank each and every
one of you for coming today!

241
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:51,306
This is an historic moment
for the world of devils...

242
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:53,906
And I want our dear guests
to be the first to know.

243
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:56,806
Two great dynasties
are about to become one...

244
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,373
Lord Riser of the distinguished
House of Phoenix,

245
00:08:59,406 --> 00:09:03,206
shall wed Lady Rias of the
illustrious House of Gremory!

246
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,173
And now...

247
00:09:04,206 --> 00:09:05,540
I present to you.

248
00:09:05,573 --> 00:09:06,906
My bride.

249
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:08,606
Rias Gremory!

250
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:16,840
Issei!

251
00:09:16,873 --> 00:09:18,373
Rias!

252
00:09:18,406 --> 00:09:19,873
Who do you think you are, boy?

253
00:09:19,906 --> 00:09:20,940
I'm Issei Hyodo, and I'm here

254
00:09:20,973 --> 00:09:23,673
to bring Rias Gremory
back where she belongs...!

255
00:09:23,706 --> 00:09:24,840
No one is going to take anything

256
00:09:24,873 --> 00:09:27,240
from her that she
doesn't want to give.

257
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:28,706
How dare you?!

258
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,640
Seriously is this guy mental?!

259
00:09:30,673 --> 00:09:32,840
Seize him!

260
00:09:32,873 --> 00:09:35,573
Guess that's our cue to get
involved, so whaddaya say guys?

261
00:09:35,606 --> 00:09:36,006
Yeah.

262
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,706
Let's do this.

263
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:39,506
We're here, Issei...

264
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,340
And we got your
back all the way!

265
00:09:41,373 --> 00:09:43,240
Suck on that, douche.

266
00:09:43,273 --> 00:09:43,873
Thanks you guys!

267
00:09:43,906 --> 00:09:45,373
You're awesome.

268
00:09:45,406 --> 00:09:46,206
Mmmm!

269
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,573
That was like super hot.

270
00:09:47,606 --> 00:09:48,906
Akeno?

271
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,506
Go save Rias, Issei.

272
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:51,373
All right!

273
00:09:51,406 --> 00:09:52,306
Is this your doing?

274
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:54,573
Lord Riser, what is
the meaning of this?

275
00:09:54,606 --> 00:09:56,873
It's just a little
entertainment I prepared.

276
00:09:56,906 --> 00:09:58,173
Who's that?

277
00:09:58,206 --> 00:09:59,573
My brother's here?

278
00:09:59,606 --> 00:10:01,306
That guy's your brother?!

279
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:03,206
It's the Great Devil, Lucifer!

280
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,740
Whoa, he looks hard-core!

281
00:10:05,773 --> 00:10:08,340
What exactly do you
mean by entertainment?

282
00:10:08,373 --> 00:10:09,773
I watched the Game, Riser.

283
00:10:09,806 --> 00:10:12,673
And honestly, I was
underwhelmed by you.

284
00:10:12,706 --> 00:10:15,373
My sister lacks your
gaming experience and yet,

285
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:17,340
against your considerably
larger forces,

286
00:10:17,373 --> 00:10:19,406
she nearly had you beat.

287
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,906
It's the final result
that counts, my Lord.

288
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:22,940
In the past...

289
00:10:22,973 --> 00:10:25,406
But the Games don't
mean what they used to...

290
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,240
Besides, Riser, you
were nearly brought

291
00:10:27,273 --> 00:10:30,473
to your knees by a
first time competitor...

292
00:10:30,506 --> 00:10:31,940
I can't imagine
your family's proud

293
00:10:31,973 --> 00:10:33,606
of the way you performed...

294
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:36,506
I think you should be
given another chance.

295
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:38,206
Besides, we don't
have a celebration

296
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,173
like this every day...

297
00:10:39,206 --> 00:10:42,373
This party could use
some flair I think...

298
00:10:42,406 --> 00:10:43,406
You there.

299
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,506
They say you possess
the power of the Dragon...

300
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:49,173
And I, for one, would like
to see what you're made of,

301
00:10:49,206 --> 00:10:52,173
which is why I had Grayfia
bring you here this evening.

302
00:10:52,206 --> 00:10:52,840
I see...

303
00:10:52,873 --> 00:10:54,240
You want a fight.

304
00:10:54,273 --> 00:10:56,206
Dragon versus Phoenix, yes...

305
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,706
I believe your guests
would quite enjoy

306
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:02,240
a head to head match between
two powers such as yours.

307
00:11:21,069 --> 00:11:21,802
No...

308
00:11:21,835 --> 00:11:23,002
Please don't!

309
00:11:23,035 --> 00:11:25,269
An excellent idea, my Lord...

310
00:11:25,302 --> 00:11:27,835
I'd be more than
happy to oblige you.

311
00:11:27,869 --> 00:11:29,102
And you... Dragon?

312
00:11:29,135 --> 00:11:30,135
Sorry, what?

313
00:11:30,169 --> 00:11:31,302
There are many here

314
00:11:31,335 --> 00:11:33,435
who have quite an interest
in seeing your abilities...

315
00:11:33,469 --> 00:11:34,302
Would you be kind enough

316
00:11:34,335 --> 00:11:36,102
to show them what
you're capable of?

317
00:11:36,135 --> 00:11:37,069
Hell yes.

318
00:11:37,102 --> 00:11:38,335
Issei, don't do it.

319
00:11:38,369 --> 00:11:39,802
Relax, Rias.

320
00:11:39,835 --> 00:11:41,835
Mister Hyodo is a big boy...

321
00:11:41,869 --> 00:11:44,869
Riser is certain
he can handle himself.

322
00:11:44,902 --> 00:11:46,835
So tell me, Dragon,
if you're the victor,

323
00:11:46,869 --> 00:11:49,135
what would you like
to have as your reward?

324
00:11:49,169 --> 00:11:50,735
You can't be serious!

325
00:11:50,769 --> 00:11:52,969
A reward for a
lower-class devil?

326
00:11:53,002 --> 00:11:54,202
Your king has spoken.

327
00:11:54,235 --> 00:11:56,835
Lower-class or not,
he'll get his prize.

328
00:11:56,869 --> 00:11:58,835
I'm the one that's
requested this of him...

329
00:11:58,869 --> 00:12:01,402
I must give him compensation
for his trouble...

330
00:12:01,435 --> 00:12:02,769
What would you
like to receive...?

331
00:12:02,802 --> 00:12:03,669
A title...?

332
00:12:03,702 --> 00:12:05,302
Or perhaps a woman
of great beauty...?

333
00:12:05,335 --> 00:12:08,135
Ask, and if you win,
you shall receive.

334
00:12:08,169 --> 00:12:09,435
Here goes.

335
00:12:09,469 --> 00:12:10,135
Fine...

336
00:12:10,169 --> 00:12:12,969
There's only one thing I want.

337
00:12:13,002 --> 00:12:14,835
Rias Gremory!

338
00:12:14,869 --> 00:12:15,469
All right.

339
00:12:15,502 --> 00:12:18,102
It's time to get started.

340
00:12:18,135 --> 00:12:18,769
Good...

341
00:12:18,802 --> 00:12:20,369
I'm ready if you are, Riser!

342
00:12:20,402 --> 00:12:23,135
You messed with the wrong
family this time, Hyodo!

343
00:12:23,169 --> 00:12:25,135
My brother's about
to tear you a new one!

344
00:12:25,169 --> 00:12:25,835
Yes...

345
00:12:25,869 --> 00:12:27,169
He's quite the confident one,

346
00:12:27,202 --> 00:12:29,302
but I'll take him
down a few pegs...!

347
00:12:29,335 --> 00:12:30,335
Come, boy...

348
00:12:30,369 --> 00:12:32,402
Fight me!

349
00:12:32,435 --> 00:12:34,002
Alright, it's time
to upgrade...!

350
00:12:34,035 --> 00:12:36,002
Only one more chance!

351
00:12:36,035 --> 00:12:37,002
Issei...

352
00:12:37,035 --> 00:12:39,235
Please be careful out there.

353
00:12:40,402 --> 00:12:42,369
Promotion...

354
00:12:42,402 --> 00:12:43,469
Queen!

355
00:12:43,502 --> 00:12:45,235
It's no use!

356
00:12:45,269 --> 00:12:46,869
Die!

357
00:12:48,035 --> 00:12:50,335
I don't have any talent
with swords like Kiba...

358
00:12:50,369 --> 00:12:52,802
And I don't have
Akeno's gift with magic...

359
00:12:52,835 --> 00:12:55,135
I'm nowhere near
as strong as Koneko...

360
00:12:55,169 --> 00:12:59,135
And I don't know the first thing
about being a healer like Asia.

361
00:12:59,169 --> 00:13:00,269
I may not be like them

362
00:13:00,302 --> 00:13:02,769
but there's one thing
I've got plenty of... heart...!

363
00:13:02,802 --> 00:13:04,402
And I promise you this much...

364
00:13:04,435 --> 00:13:06,469
Nothing will stop
me from saving her...!

365
00:13:06,502 --> 00:13:08,369
Shine forth...!

366
00:13:08,402 --> 00:13:10,269
Over Booster!

367
00:13:10,902 --> 00:13:12,035
Welsh Dragon...

368
00:13:12,069 --> 00:13:14,169
Over Booster!

369
00:13:28,202 --> 00:13:30,702
This is the Dragon
Emperor's power...!

370
00:13:30,735 --> 00:13:32,069
Balance breaker...!

371
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:33,235
Boosted Gear...

372
00:13:33,269 --> 00:13:34,802
Scale Mail!

373
00:13:34,835 --> 00:13:35,835
The balance breaker...?

374
00:13:35,869 --> 00:13:37,269
Where did that come from?

375
00:13:37,302 --> 00:13:39,702
Fascinating.

376
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:42,135
The forbidden, infernal form.

377
00:13:42,169 --> 00:13:43,469
I want you to make
a deal with me.

378
00:13:43,502 --> 00:13:45,169
Sounds interesting.

379
00:13:45,202 --> 00:13:47,135
You sure you're ready for this?

380
00:13:47,169 --> 00:13:48,902
Are you in or are you out?

381
00:13:48,935 --> 00:13:50,269
Like I said...

382
00:13:50,302 --> 00:13:53,269
I will grant you a power
worthy of your sacrifice...

383
00:13:53,302 --> 00:13:56,369
But you have only
to the count of ten...

384
00:13:56,402 --> 00:14:00,202
Anything beyond and
your body will not survive.

385
00:14:00,235 --> 00:14:01,235
Fine by me...

386
00:14:01,269 --> 00:14:03,202
That's plenty of time.

387
00:14:03,235 --> 00:14:06,202
Rias doesn't
belong to you, jerk!

388
00:14:06,235 --> 00:14:07,302
Ten!

389
00:14:13,002 --> 00:14:15,335
Over here!

390
00:14:15,369 --> 00:14:17,802
Nine!

391
00:14:19,069 --> 00:14:21,235
I've never seen speed
and power like this...!

392
00:14:21,269 --> 00:14:23,235
Who do you think
you are, Hyodo?!

393
00:14:23,269 --> 00:14:25,802
You're nothing compared
to Riser, you understand?

394
00:14:25,835 --> 00:14:26,835
Nothing!

395
00:14:26,869 --> 00:14:28,702
I am a Phoenix nobleman...!

396
00:14:28,735 --> 00:14:31,335
The flame of the immortal
bird burns within me...

397
00:14:31,369 --> 00:14:35,302
The hellfire of my clan will
scorch you to dust!

398
00:14:35,335 --> 00:14:37,235
You think I'm scared
of you, Riser...?!

399
00:14:37,269 --> 00:14:39,969
I'm gonna make you sorry
you ever messed with us!

400
00:14:46,335 --> 00:14:48,269
I'm glad I've got
this Scale Mail on.

401
00:14:48,302 --> 00:14:51,402
Riser's hellfire
attack is no joke.

402
00:14:51,435 --> 00:14:52,469
Seven!

403
00:14:52,502 --> 00:14:55,135
If you weren't hiding
behind that armor, pawn...

404
00:14:55,169 --> 00:14:59,202
There'd be nothing left of you
but a pile of smoking ashes!

405
00:15:06,302 --> 00:15:08,402
Six!

406
00:15:09,869 --> 00:15:11,735
You're done...

407
00:15:12,302 --> 00:15:13,202
This pain...

408
00:15:13,235 --> 00:15:14,735
It burns!

409
00:15:14,769 --> 00:15:16,002
What have you done?!

410
00:15:16,035 --> 00:15:18,702
Is that a cross?!

411
00:15:22,135 --> 00:15:24,035
Five!

412
00:15:24,069 --> 00:15:26,469
Where'd you get that?

413
00:15:26,502 --> 00:15:29,169
Our bishop used to be
a member of the Church...

414
00:15:29,202 --> 00:15:31,069
I borrowed this from her
and added a boost

415
00:15:31,102 --> 00:15:32,869
from my Sacred Gear.

416
00:15:32,902 --> 00:15:34,269
No matter how powerful
you think you are,

417
00:15:34,302 --> 00:15:35,202
you're nothing compared

418
00:15:35,235 --> 00:15:37,369
to the cross I'm holding
in my hand, Riser!

419
00:15:37,402 --> 00:15:38,135
Four!

420
00:15:38,169 --> 00:15:39,135
Impossible...!

421
00:15:39,169 --> 00:15:41,035
A devil can't hold a cross!

422
00:15:41,069 --> 00:15:43,402
Even wearing your
dragon armor shouldn't stop

423
00:15:43,435 --> 00:15:46,135
that thing from destroying you!

424
00:15:47,069 --> 00:15:48,035
It can't be...

425
00:15:48,069 --> 00:15:49,102
Wait...

426
00:15:49,135 --> 00:15:51,769
You offered that dragon
your own arm, didn't you?!

427
00:15:51,802 --> 00:15:52,335
Three!

428
00:15:52,369 --> 00:15:53,469
You're damn right I did,

429
00:15:53,502 --> 00:15:56,002
and now I'm gonna take
you down, you son of a bitch!

430
00:15:56,035 --> 00:15:57,769
This arm is no longer mine.

431
00:15:57,802 --> 00:15:58,702
Understand?

432
00:15:58,735 --> 00:16:00,802
What?

433
00:16:01,369 --> 00:16:03,469
Just watch.

434
00:16:03,502 --> 00:16:04,935
See, it doesn't hurt me...

435
00:16:04,969 --> 00:16:06,269
I'm okay.

436
00:16:08,402 --> 00:16:09,502
Have you lost your mind?!

437
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:12,169
After what you've done,
you'll never be the same again!

438
00:16:12,202 --> 00:16:13,102
Two!

439
00:16:13,135 --> 00:16:14,235
You think I care?!

440
00:16:14,269 --> 00:16:16,235
He gave up his
own arm for this...

441
00:16:16,269 --> 00:16:19,135
Issei's going to win,
I just know it!

442
00:16:19,169 --> 00:16:20,935
He'll defeat Riser...

443
00:16:20,969 --> 00:16:23,135
And he'll bring
Rias back home to us.

444
00:16:23,169 --> 00:16:24,035
One!

445
00:16:24,069 --> 00:16:25,369
It doesn't matter
what happens to me!

446
00:16:25,402 --> 00:16:27,935
If it saves Rias
that's all I care about!

447
00:16:27,969 --> 00:16:29,402
Because she's worth it!

448
00:16:31,835 --> 00:16:33,102
Count is up!

449
00:16:36,435 --> 00:16:38,702
Unfortunately,
you are out of time.

450
00:16:38,735 --> 00:16:39,902
Come on, you gotta
be kidding me?!

451
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:41,202
I was so close!

452
00:16:41,235 --> 00:16:42,869
What am I gonna have
to pay you this time?

453
00:16:42,902 --> 00:16:44,335
An eye...? A leg?

454
00:16:44,369 --> 00:16:45,969
I'll give you whatever you want!

455
00:16:46,002 --> 00:16:47,902
Sorry, but with
your current abilities,

456
00:16:47,935 --> 00:16:49,969
there's nothing else I can do.

457
00:16:50,002 --> 00:16:51,169
Of course...

458
00:16:51,202 --> 00:16:53,769
I'm not strong enough, it always
ends this way, doesn't it?

459
00:16:53,802 --> 00:16:54,902
When I took back the armor,

460
00:16:54,935 --> 00:16:58,035
I released a very small
amount of power to the gem...

461
00:16:58,069 --> 00:16:59,869
You'll only have
it temporarily...

462
00:16:59,902 --> 00:17:02,835
However, I'm not
sure it will be enough

463
00:17:02,869 --> 00:17:05,202
to counter Phoenix's
regenerative capabilities.

464
00:17:05,235 --> 00:17:06,769
I still have to try...

465
00:17:06,802 --> 00:17:07,702
I'll fight.

466
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:08,435
I won't...

467
00:17:08,469 --> 00:17:10,069
Give up.

468
00:17:13,269 --> 00:17:14,102
That's too bad.

469
00:17:14,135 --> 00:17:16,269
Looks like someone
lost their armor.

470
00:17:16,302 --> 00:17:19,135
Riser believes it's time
to end this pathetic charade.

471
00:17:19,169 --> 00:17:20,369
I'm not done.

472
00:17:20,402 --> 00:17:21,835
If you're gonna
put out a fire...

473
00:17:21,869 --> 00:17:22,802
Well...

474
00:17:22,835 --> 00:17:24,735
You're gonna need water.

475
00:17:24,769 --> 00:17:25,535
Holy Water?

476
00:17:25,569 --> 00:17:26,702
Will Holy Water
even work against

477
00:17:26,735 --> 00:17:28,769
a devil as strong as Riser?

478
00:17:30,335 --> 00:17:33,135
Try this on for size, asshole!

479
00:17:33,169 --> 00:17:34,835
Transfer!

480
00:17:40,502 --> 00:17:41,735
Look at Riser!

481
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:44,935
The holy water is draining his
mental and physical strength.

482
00:17:44,969 --> 00:17:46,902
It's preventing him
from regenerating!

483
00:17:46,935 --> 00:17:48,735
Not even the Lord of the
House of Phoenix can rise

484
00:17:48,769 --> 00:17:52,735
from the ashes when his mind's
under this kind of attack.

485
00:17:52,769 --> 00:17:53,335
His mind?

486
00:17:53,369 --> 00:17:54,335
Indeed...

487
00:17:54,369 --> 00:17:57,802
His body's immortal but
his mind is far from it.

488
00:17:57,835 --> 00:17:59,402
How's that feel, Riser...?

489
00:17:59,435 --> 00:18:01,169
Asia taught me that
devils are vulnerable

490
00:18:01,202 --> 00:18:03,069
to crosses and Holy Water.

491
00:18:03,102 --> 00:18:04,102
Use both in tandem

492
00:18:04,135 --> 00:18:08,169
and not even a devil
like you stands a chance!

493
00:18:08,202 --> 00:18:09,869
Kiba taught me to
widen my field of vision

494
00:18:09,902 --> 00:18:11,802
whenever I'm
battling an opponent!

495
00:18:14,869 --> 00:18:16,002
Transfer!

496
00:18:16,035 --> 00:18:17,735
Akeno taught me to use magic...!

497
00:18:17,769 --> 00:18:19,102
To take the power
of my body's aura

498
00:18:19,135 --> 00:18:21,069
and release it on
a single point...!

499
00:18:21,102 --> 00:18:25,235
And to amplify my attack by
increasing my mental focus!

500
00:18:25,269 --> 00:18:28,735
And Koneko taught me to aim
for the center of the body...

501
00:18:28,769 --> 00:18:32,102
To strike with precision,
right at the heart of my enemy!

502
00:18:32,135 --> 00:18:32,469
No...

503
00:18:32,502 --> 00:18:33,169
Stop it...

504
00:18:33,202 --> 00:18:34,402
Don't...

505
00:18:34,435 --> 00:18:37,135
This engagement's important
to the future of all devils...

506
00:18:37,169 --> 00:18:38,069
You fool!

507
00:18:38,102 --> 00:18:39,169
A mere servant like
you has no business

508
00:18:39,202 --> 00:18:42,402
getting involved with
the affairs of your betters!

509
00:18:42,435 --> 00:18:42,835
Don't you understand?

510
00:18:42,869 --> 00:18:45,002
I don't care!

511
00:18:45,035 --> 00:18:45,935
Rias...

512
00:18:45,969 --> 00:18:48,735
She's the only thing
that matters to me!

513
00:18:48,769 --> 00:18:51,702
And the fact that you'd
force her to be with you...

514
00:18:51,735 --> 00:18:53,335
...when she
obviously hates you...

515
00:18:53,369 --> 00:18:56,369
Well that's reason enough
for me to take you out!

516
00:18:56,402 --> 00:18:58,735
Suck on this, scum-bag!

517
00:19:03,169 --> 00:19:04,835
Bastard.

518
00:19:06,502 --> 00:19:08,335
Don't hurt him!

519
00:19:10,969 --> 00:19:12,769
If I were you, I would
step aside little girl.

520
00:19:12,802 --> 00:19:15,735
Unless you want to be next!

521
00:19:17,169 --> 00:19:18,135
Issei...

522
00:19:18,169 --> 00:19:19,735
You did it.

523
00:19:19,769 --> 00:19:21,969
You really did it.

524
00:19:26,388 --> 00:19:28,222
This battle is done.

525
00:19:38,688 --> 00:19:40,122
Whoa, good catch, dude.

526
00:19:40,155 --> 00:19:41,188
Way to rock the house.

527
00:19:41,222 --> 00:19:44,455
You... Totally nailed it!

528
00:19:44,488 --> 00:19:45,255
Yep.

529
00:19:45,288 --> 00:19:46,055
Hey, wait.

530
00:19:46,088 --> 00:19:47,355
See ya.

531
00:19:51,588 --> 00:19:52,722
Hey there, Rias.

532
00:19:52,755 --> 00:19:54,222
Issei...

533
00:19:54,255 --> 00:19:56,422
You just saved my life.

534
00:19:57,188 --> 00:19:59,055
Thank you.

535
00:20:06,155 --> 00:20:07,455
Jeez, what's that?

536
00:20:07,488 --> 00:20:08,522
He's a griffon.

537
00:20:08,555 --> 00:20:10,355
Isn't he cute?

538
00:20:10,388 --> 00:20:12,255
Well, Issei, since
you saved the day,

539
00:20:12,288 --> 00:20:14,622
I think it's only fair
you ride back with Rias.

540
00:20:14,655 --> 00:20:16,155
Uh. On that?

541
00:20:16,188 --> 00:20:17,655
Yes, please...

542
00:20:17,688 --> 00:20:19,355
Unless you don't want to.

543
00:20:19,388 --> 00:20:22,488
Are you kidding me,
of course I do!

544
00:20:24,488 --> 00:20:27,322
If I don't die on this thing,
I'll see ya at the club!

545
00:20:34,255 --> 00:20:35,488
Beautiful, isn't it?

546
00:20:35,522 --> 00:20:37,422
I had that griffon ready
in case they needed

547
00:20:37,455 --> 00:20:39,388
to make a last minute escape.

548
00:20:39,422 --> 00:20:41,522
Thank goodness
it didn't come to that...

549
00:20:41,555 --> 00:20:43,655
We would've had quite
a mess to clean up.

550
00:20:43,688 --> 00:20:44,855
I wouldn't worry too much;

551
00:20:44,888 --> 00:20:48,422
my father and Sir Phoenix
have found some common ground...

552
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:49,688
Such a shame though...

553
00:20:49,722 --> 00:20:51,788
For an engagement
to fall apart like this.

554
00:20:51,822 --> 00:20:53,388
Yes, you're right...

555
00:20:53,422 --> 00:20:54,622
It's very sad.

556
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:56,722
You look devastated.

557
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:58,422
It's truly a miracle...

558
00:20:58,455 --> 00:20:59,488
I never dreamed it was possible

559
00:20:59,522 --> 00:21:02,755
the great red dragon
would come over to our side.

560
00:21:02,788 --> 00:21:04,388
It seems likely
that the encounter

561
00:21:04,422 --> 00:21:05,622
with the Vanishing One...

562
00:21:05,655 --> 00:21:09,088
the White Dragon...
could be upon us soon.

563
00:21:13,622 --> 00:21:14,622
You okay?

564
00:21:14,655 --> 00:21:16,088
Silly boy.

565
00:21:16,122 --> 00:21:18,822
To give up your arm just for me.

566
00:21:18,855 --> 00:21:20,188
Hey, it was worth it...

567
00:21:20,222 --> 00:21:21,255
Totally...

568
00:21:21,288 --> 00:21:23,455
I would have done anything
to get you back safely.

569
00:21:23,488 --> 00:21:24,255
Issei, look...

570
00:21:24,288 --> 00:21:26,488
The engagement
may be over now...

571
00:21:26,522 --> 00:21:28,055
But I promise you
this isn't the last

572
00:21:28,088 --> 00:21:29,755
we'll hear of it,
not by any means.

573
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:31,288
Then I'll give up
my other arm...

574
00:21:31,322 --> 00:21:32,588
And then my eyes if I have to.

575
00:21:32,622 --> 00:21:34,088
Issei.

576
00:21:34,122 --> 00:21:35,655
I'll do whatever it takes...

577
00:21:35,688 --> 00:21:37,322
Nothing is gonna stop me.

578
00:21:37,355 --> 00:21:39,555
I'll always save you.

579
00:21:39,588 --> 00:21:41,088
I'm your pawn, after all...

580
00:21:41,122 --> 00:21:43,322
It's my job, right?

581
00:21:56,255 --> 00:21:57,055
Hey...!

582
00:21:57,088 --> 00:21:58,822
It's time to wake up,
sleepy head!

583
00:21:58,855 --> 00:22:00,088
Pinky's here!

584
00:22:00,122 --> 00:22:01,422
Is that morning wood?

585
00:22:01,455 --> 00:22:04,722
Oh my, you're a
naughty boy, aren't you?!

586
00:22:06,322 --> 00:22:07,788
That was my first kiss.

587
00:22:07,822 --> 00:22:09,422
It's a bit of a
monumental moment

588
00:22:09,455 --> 00:22:11,155
for a young woman, isn't it?

589
00:22:11,188 --> 00:22:12,755
Uh, I guess it kinda is, huh...?

590
00:22:12,788 --> 00:22:14,388
Wait, that was
your first kiss...!

591
00:22:14,422 --> 00:22:16,322
Man, I hope
I didn't screw it up!

592
00:22:16,355 --> 00:22:17,555
Well, since it is my first,

593
00:22:17,588 --> 00:22:20,255
I guess I have no way
of knowing, do I...?

594
00:22:20,288 --> 00:22:21,588
I liked it, though.

595
00:22:22,422 --> 00:22:24,388
She liked it!

596
00:22:24,422 --> 00:22:25,255
Oh, Issei?

597
00:22:25,288 --> 00:22:26,522
Uh huh?

598
00:22:26,555 --> 00:22:29,355
I almost forgot, I've decided
I'm going to live at your place.

599
00:22:29,388 --> 00:22:30,622
What?!

600
00:22:30,655 --> 00:22:33,322
Unless you have an
objection, of course.

601
00:22:47,555 --> 00:22:48,588
Come on, you stupid arm, heal!

602
00:22:48,622 --> 00:22:50,355
Please heal...!

603
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:56,355
Guys run!

604
00:22:56,388 --> 00:22:57,422
"Get back here right
now, you perverts!

605
00:22:57,455 --> 00:23:00,322
I'll teach you to spy on
helpless, innocent girls!

606
00:23:00,355 --> 00:23:02,388
You guys are a
bunch of jack wagons!

607
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:04,455
You're never gonna get laid,
you understand me?

608
00:23:04,488 --> 00:23:06,055
Never!"

609
00:23:08,355 --> 00:23:10,155
Dude, I saw some tit,
I swear I did!

610
00:23:10,188 --> 00:23:11,255
Yeah, tig' o' biddies!

611
00:23:11,288 --> 00:23:12,788
That was awesome!

612
00:23:22,322 --> 00:23:23,655
More than anything...

613
00:23:23,688 --> 00:23:25,622
I wanted to protect her.

614
00:23:27,755 --> 00:23:30,388
Not cause it's my duty or
cause it's expected of me,

615
00:23:30,422 --> 00:23:32,222
or anything like that...

616
00:23:32,255 --> 00:23:35,355
I wanted to protect her
because of how amazing she is...

617
00:23:35,388 --> 00:23:39,255
Because I believe
she's totally worth it.

618
00:23:39,288 --> 00:23:41,755
It's always been her.

619
00:23:41,788 --> 00:23:44,055
And it always will be.

620
00:23:51,822 --> 00:23:53,288
Forever.
