1
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,900
Issei!

2
00:00:17,933 --> 00:00:20,100
It's not National Go To
School Whenever You Want Day!

3
00:00:20,133 --> 00:00:21,233
I know! I'm awake!

4
00:00:21,266 --> 00:00:22,600
I'll be down in just a second!

5
00:00:22,633 --> 00:00:24,700
I'm just, um, stretching!

6
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:26,466
Who needs a treadmill
when you've got a daily trek

7
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,033
up some stairs to yank
a grown boy outta bed?

8
00:00:29,066 --> 00:00:29,533
Quick...!

9
00:00:29,566 --> 00:00:30,666
Put this over you!

10
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,233
Good morning,
how are you today?

11
00:00:35,266 --> 00:00:36,500
I'm... fine.

12
00:00:36,533 --> 00:00:40,533
Issei, you're late... and naked.

13
00:00:40,566 --> 00:00:42,500
Do you know what
he's doing up there?!

14
00:00:42,533 --> 00:00:43,733
Why are you yelling at me?!

15
00:00:43,766 --> 00:00:45,700
What--is he gripping the
girlie magazines again?

16
00:00:45,733 --> 00:00:47,333
Let the boy have his time!

17
00:00:47,366 --> 00:00:48,400
No! She was real!

18
00:00:48,433 --> 00:00:51,766
She was alive and she was
naked in our son's bed!

19
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,066
All right, stop the car!

20
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,533
You mean he has
a girl up there?!

21
00:00:54,566 --> 00:00:56,300
Dear God, make me
a bird, so I can fly,

22
00:00:56,333 --> 00:00:58,700
far far away from here.

23
00:01:00,233 --> 00:01:01,133
Wait a minute.

24
00:01:01,166 --> 00:01:02,466
I was just in bed with Rias.

25
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:03,333
I'm naked.

26
00:01:03,366 --> 00:01:04,333
She's naked.

27
00:01:04,366 --> 00:01:06,066
I have no idea how it happened.

28
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:06,966
This is bullshit.

29
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,133
I could have had the
most amazing night

30
00:01:08,166 --> 00:01:10,766
of my life last night and
I don't remember any of it.

31
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,633
What kind of doucher blacks
out on his first time?!

32
00:01:13,666 --> 00:01:14,700
Son of a--

33
00:01:14,733 --> 00:01:16,333
It's quite a party here
in the morning, isn't it?

34
00:01:16,366 --> 00:01:19,300
Um... you're not
covered up anymore.

35
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:20,233
Yes, I know.

36
00:01:20,266 --> 00:01:20,800
But...

37
00:01:20,833 --> 00:01:21,866
I can see your stuff.

38
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:25,133
Want me to stand up so
you can get a better view?

39
00:01:25,166 --> 00:01:26,166
She didn't just say that.

40
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,133
Girls don't say that.

41
00:01:27,166 --> 00:01:28,466
I must still be asleep.

42
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,366
Please don't wake me up--Amen.

43
00:01:38,266 --> 00:01:39,400
Better?

44
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:41,333
How's your tummy feel?

45
00:01:41,366 --> 00:01:42,533
Where you were stabbed.

46
00:01:42,566 --> 00:01:45,500
I was stabbed?

47
00:01:45,533 --> 00:01:46,700
Was I talking in my sleep?

48
00:01:46,733 --> 00:01:49,133
How does she know
about my dream?

49
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,000
It wasn't a dream, Love.

50
00:01:54,433 --> 00:01:55,566
Your body is amazing.

51
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,600
I didn't expect that.

52
00:01:58,633 --> 00:02:00,333
You took quite a
lethal blow and somehow

53
00:02:00,366 --> 00:02:05,033
were able to recover
in just one night.

54
00:02:05,066 --> 00:02:06,033
Recover from what?

55
00:02:06,066 --> 00:02:07,300
It left you weak.

56
00:02:07,333 --> 00:02:10,300
But all you needed was a little
magic touch to bring you back...

57
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:13,400
...and I need you.

58
00:02:14,533 --> 00:02:16,300
Would you do this for me?

59
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:17,100
Oh god...!

60
00:02:17,133 --> 00:02:18,266
Yes!

61
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:21,166
So, uh, how come
I'm all, like, naked?

62
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,100
I just told you, your wound
couldn't heal on its own.

63
00:02:24,133 --> 00:02:26,333
So I held you close
and used my magic...

64
00:02:26,366 --> 00:02:28,366
It only works if
we are undressed.

65
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,633
Her parts touched
mine... naked!

66
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:33,300
And you don't have to worry.

67
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:36,100
We didn't do it;
I'm still a virgin.

68
00:02:36,133 --> 00:02:37,200
Great...

69
00:02:37,233 --> 00:02:40,166
Me too--isn't it awesome?

70
00:02:40,533 --> 00:02:43,300
No! It's not fucking
'awesome', damn it!

71
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:46,033
Now what's with that face?

72
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,233
You should be smiling;
this world is magical.

73
00:02:49,266 --> 00:02:50,566
I'm smiling inside.

74
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,366
So I just remembered...
something weird.

75
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,333
What is it?

76
00:02:54,366 --> 00:02:56,800
Did you say something
about being a devil?

77
00:02:56,833 --> 00:02:57,700
Yes I did...

78
00:02:57,733 --> 00:03:00,333
That's because I am one.

79
00:03:00,366 --> 00:03:02,733
I also told you I'm your master.

80
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:06,266
I like the name 'Issei.'
I'll let you keep it.

81
00:04:42,219 --> 00:04:43,386
There's no frikkin' way!

82
00:04:43,419 --> 00:04:45,753
He had to have done her homework
or paid her or something!

83
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:46,753
What is happening here?

84
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,319
Is he supposed to be cool now?

85
00:04:48,353 --> 00:04:48,953
Yes!

86
00:04:48,986 --> 00:04:50,986
And I think it's working!

87
00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:53,119
Let the gossip games begin...!

88
00:04:53,153 --> 00:04:54,253
Whatever.

89
00:04:54,286 --> 00:04:56,186
Guess that's what happens
when you start hanging out

90
00:04:56,219 --> 00:04:58,553
with the hottest
pair of jugs at school.

91
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:05,086
I'll send someone
to fetch you later.

92
00:05:05,119 --> 00:05:05,753
Fetch me?

93
00:05:05,786 --> 00:05:06,453
That's right.

94
00:05:06,486 --> 00:05:08,219
I'll talk to you after school.

95
00:05:08,253 --> 00:05:09,119
Wait! Rias!

96
00:05:09,153 --> 00:05:11,019
Hold on a second,
I don't understand!

97
00:05:11,053 --> 00:05:12,286
Shouldn't I walk you to class?

98
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,219
What the fuck?!

99
00:05:13,253 --> 00:05:14,086
Is that how it is?

100
00:05:14,119 --> 00:05:15,053
How we s'post to be bros

101
00:05:15,086 --> 00:05:17,486
when you're pimpin'
Big Red on the DL, man?!

102
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:19,453
Matsuda, there's
no need for that.

103
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:20,286
But he's frontin'!

104
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:21,519
Issei is our buddy.

105
00:05:21,553 --> 00:05:23,386
Let's give him a
chance to explain...

106
00:05:23,419 --> 00:05:24,419
Where did you go

107
00:05:24,453 --> 00:05:26,686
and what did you do
after you left yesterday?!

108
00:05:26,719 --> 00:05:28,892
I'll be happy to
explain, gentlemen.

109
00:05:28,892 --> 00:05:29,519
Yeah, yeah.

110
00:05:29,553 --> 00:05:30,653
Spill it!

111
00:05:30,686 --> 00:05:32,386
See... yesterday...

112
00:05:32,419 --> 00:05:34,486
I was rollin' in some Double Ds.

113
00:05:38,486 --> 00:05:41,453
You seem very certain about him.

114
00:05:44,186 --> 00:05:45,253
Hello again, Rias...

115
00:05:45,286 --> 00:05:46,553
Good to see you.

116
00:05:46,586 --> 00:05:49,119
It's good to see you, too, Sona.

117
00:05:49,719 --> 00:05:52,353
Never seen you take on
anyone so impulsively...

118
00:05:52,386 --> 00:05:54,186
What's so special
about that one?

119
00:05:54,219 --> 00:05:56,253
I don't know exactly.

120
00:05:56,286 --> 00:05:57,386
But... I will say

121
00:05:57,419 --> 00:05:59,986
it kinda feels as though
I've adopted a little brother.

122
00:06:03,386 --> 00:06:04,319
Paper rock scissors!

123
00:06:04,353 --> 00:06:05,986
I see.

124
00:06:10,486 --> 00:06:12,753
I don't know who she's
sending to fetch me...

125
00:06:12,786 --> 00:06:15,319
but they're sure taking
their sweet ass time.

126
00:06:17,253 --> 00:06:18,186
Hey.

127
00:06:18,219 --> 00:06:19,153
Look, it's Kiba!

128
00:06:19,186 --> 00:06:21,186
"Like... Omigod, it's
Prince Golden Nuts!"

129
00:06:21,219 --> 00:06:22,119
Shut up.

130
00:06:22,153 --> 00:06:23,553
You're all looking lovely today.

131
00:06:23,586 --> 00:06:24,753
You look better!

132
00:06:24,786 --> 00:06:26,986
I'm sorry the
room's not cleaner!

133
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:28,753
Ah! There you are!

134
00:06:28,786 --> 00:06:29,653
Huh?

135
00:06:29,686 --> 00:06:30,386
Uh, yeah.

136
00:06:30,419 --> 00:06:31,319
This is my desk.

137
00:06:31,353 --> 00:06:32,253
Excellent!

138
00:06:32,286 --> 00:06:33,986
I'm here on an errand
from Rias Gremory.

139
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:34,686
What?

140
00:06:34,719 --> 00:06:35,719
Wait, is this the 'fetching?'

141
00:06:35,753 --> 00:06:37,986
Would you mind coming with me?

142
00:06:38,019 --> 00:06:39,253
Omigod...!

143
00:06:39,286 --> 00:06:41,553
Is Kiba Kakes about to walk out
of this room with weasel boy?!

144
00:06:41,586 --> 00:06:42,453
Kiba don't do it!

145
00:06:42,486 --> 00:06:43,619
You'll catch 'Pervert!'

146
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:45,519
You'll lose all your friends
and smell like moldy meat!

147
00:06:45,553 --> 00:06:46,386
Everybody just simmer down.

148
00:06:46,419 --> 00:06:48,419
I promise not to
drain his pimp juice.

149
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:00,519
What's happening?

150
00:07:00,553 --> 00:07:01,686
Where are we?

151
00:07:01,719 --> 00:07:02,219
Wait!

152
00:07:02,253 --> 00:07:03,419
I think I know her!

153
00:07:03,453 --> 00:07:05,453
Oh?

154
00:07:06,653 --> 00:07:07,686
Koneko Toujou is a first year.

155
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:11,153
And a valued member of
the Occult Research Club.

156
00:07:11,186 --> 00:07:13,119
My friend Issei here
thinks he might know you.

157
00:07:13,153 --> 00:07:15,386
Uh, I could be wrong!

158
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:17,319
I'm gonna kill him.

159
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:19,286
Who doesn't know that
perfect spinner bod?!

160
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:21,586
All the girls hate her cuz
all the guys wanna do her.

161
00:07:21,619 --> 00:07:23,019
Speaking of which...

162
00:07:23,053 --> 00:07:26,186
Damn, I wish I was that
chocolate bar right now!

163
00:07:27,119 --> 00:07:29,486
I had no idea she was
down with the ORC...!

164
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:32,386
This changes everything!

165
00:07:32,419 --> 00:07:33,353
A shower...?

166
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:34,586
Inside the club...?

167
00:07:34,619 --> 00:07:36,119
Shut up!

168
00:07:36,153 --> 00:07:37,686
Someone's in there!

169
00:07:37,719 --> 00:07:39,619
Oh great googly moogly,

170
00:07:39,653 --> 00:07:42,453
how did I get so
mother effing lucky?

171
00:07:42,486 --> 00:07:43,653
Your clothes are laid out

172
00:07:43,686 --> 00:07:45,686
when you're ready,
Miss President.

173
00:07:45,719 --> 00:07:47,019
Thank you, Akeno.

174
00:07:47,053 --> 00:07:49,619
I just heard Rias take a shower!

175
00:07:49,653 --> 00:07:51,453
I love this club, uh...

176
00:07:51,486 --> 00:07:53,286
It's not polite to spy.

177
00:07:56,053 --> 00:07:57,686
Who is that?

178
00:07:57,719 --> 00:07:59,386
I didn't see you.

179
00:08:03,453 --> 00:08:05,119
It's okay, I won't bite.

180
00:08:05,153 --> 00:08:06,186
You're the new guy, huh...?

181
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:09,053
It's nice to meet you.

182
00:08:09,086 --> 00:08:10,419
There's nothing to
be nervous about.

183
00:08:10,453 --> 00:08:12,286
Everyone here is super nice...

184
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:12,853
I'm Akeno.

185
00:08:12,886 --> 00:08:15,753
I'm the vice-president.

186
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:16,319
Uh...

187
00:08:16,353 --> 00:08:17,753
I'm Issei Hyodo and...

188
00:08:17,786 --> 00:08:20,619
I promise I'm not
always this awkward.

189
00:08:20,653 --> 00:08:21,519
'Cause I'm not always this close

190
00:08:21,553 --> 00:08:24,686
to a girl about to
bust out of her top!

191
00:08:24,719 --> 00:08:25,719
Also thinking of her

192
00:08:25,753 --> 00:08:28,119
and Rias working so
closely together is hawt!

193
00:08:28,153 --> 00:08:29,419
I bet they just hang
out together naked

194
00:08:29,453 --> 00:08:30,553
when no one's around.

195
00:08:30,586 --> 00:08:31,786
And when it's cold out,

196
00:08:31,819 --> 00:08:33,753
they cuddle in bed and have
pillow fights in the morning!

197
00:08:33,786 --> 00:08:35,719
This is the greatest club ever!

198
00:08:35,753 --> 00:08:37,219
I'm so glad I'm me!

199
00:08:37,253 --> 00:08:39,586
Sorry to keep you waiting.

200
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:40,853
I know it's terribly rude,

201
00:08:40,886 --> 00:08:43,453
but I didn't have a chance to
wash after leaving your place.

202
00:08:43,486 --> 00:08:46,386
Oh no, you're hot--uh,
fine--I mean... all good.

203
00:08:46,419 --> 00:08:49,453
Well now that you've arrived,
I think everyone is here.

204
00:08:49,486 --> 00:08:50,719
We'd like to
officially welcome you

205
00:08:50,753 --> 00:08:53,386
into the Occult Research Club.

206
00:08:53,419 --> 00:08:54,586
Uh... thanks.

207
00:08:54,619 --> 00:08:56,719
But you should know the name
of the club is just a front.

208
00:08:56,753 --> 00:08:59,153
It's supposed to look like
this is some sort of hobby.

209
00:08:59,186 --> 00:08:59,719
Okay.

210
00:08:59,753 --> 00:09:00,719
So what is it really?

211
00:09:00,753 --> 00:09:03,086
Well, since you asked
I'll be frank with you.

212
00:09:03,119 --> 00:09:05,453
I'm not the only
devil here, Issei.

213
00:09:06,719 --> 00:09:09,486
Wait... are you saying
that's what all of you are?

214
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:10,986
And the winged man
from yesterday

215
00:09:11,019 --> 00:09:12,286
was something else.

216
00:09:12,319 --> 00:09:14,453
A fallen angel.

217
00:09:14,486 --> 00:09:16,619
Some think we're the same,
which isn't true...

218
00:09:16,653 --> 00:09:17,586
They want to serve God.

219
00:09:17,619 --> 00:09:18,786
But it's too late for them...

220
00:09:18,819 --> 00:09:22,086
Their dark emotions, have
forced them into the underworld.

221
00:09:22,119 --> 00:09:23,453
The confusion is understandable

222
00:09:23,486 --> 00:09:26,353
because they, too, walk
the earth misguiding humans.

223
00:09:26,386 --> 00:09:27,586
But they wish to please God;

224
00:09:27,619 --> 00:09:29,253
so their goal is
to wipe us devils out

225
00:09:29,286 --> 00:09:31,253
and gain supremacy
over our realm.

226
00:09:31,286 --> 00:09:32,353
You call it Hell.

227
00:09:32,386 --> 00:09:35,219
And of course there're
the more recognizable angels

228
00:09:35,253 --> 00:09:38,153
who are clearly sent down by
God to defeat us as well...

229
00:09:38,186 --> 00:09:41,953
So we're constantly defending
ourselves from both sides.

230
00:09:43,153 --> 00:09:43,786
Something the matter?

231
00:09:43,819 --> 00:09:45,486
You look a bit overwhelmed.

232
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,686
Well, probably because I am.

233
00:09:47,719 --> 00:09:51,986
I mean, you're talking about
some freaky-deaky stuff here.

234
00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:54,286
Remember Yuma Amano?

235
00:09:54,319 --> 00:09:55,186
Of course you do.

236
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:56,219
How could you forget...?

237
00:09:56,253 --> 00:09:58,953
You two dated for a
little while, didn't you?

238
00:10:02,219 --> 00:10:04,253
Where did you hear that name?

239
00:10:04,286 --> 00:10:06,453
Never mind,
I don't want to know.

240
00:10:06,486 --> 00:10:08,719
Look, I'm not sure how you
know so much about my life,

241
00:10:08,753 --> 00:10:10,686
but I'm starting to feel a
little uncomfortable here,

242
00:10:10,719 --> 00:10:13,386
so maybe we should just...

243
00:10:17,619 --> 00:10:19,319
Yuma!

244
00:10:19,353 --> 00:10:21,719
That's right.
It wasn't a dream, Issei...

245
00:10:21,753 --> 00:10:23,486
She's real.

246
00:10:41,606 --> 00:10:43,273
I love this picture of you two.

247
00:10:43,306 --> 00:10:44,573
You remember it, don't you?

248
00:10:44,606 --> 00:10:45,939
Of course I do but...

249
00:10:45,973 --> 00:10:47,073
how is this possible?

250
00:10:47,106 --> 00:10:50,706
The girl you went out with
is also a fallen angel...

251
00:10:50,739 --> 00:10:52,106
She is made up of
the same elements

252
00:10:52,139 --> 00:10:54,539
as the being who
attacked you last night.

253
00:10:54,573 --> 00:10:56,239
But that's the
thing--Did I meet her?

254
00:10:56,273 --> 00:10:58,939
Matsuda and Motohama don't
remember anything about her!

255
00:10:58,973 --> 00:11:00,973
And why isn't her number
in my phone anymore?

256
00:11:01,006 --> 00:11:02,539
We can erase human memory.

257
00:11:02,573 --> 00:11:03,439
What?

258
00:11:03,473 --> 00:11:04,306
It usually ends up
being the best thing

259
00:11:04,339 --> 00:11:07,106
for everyone--including
your parents.

260
00:11:07,139 --> 00:11:10,106
Well, I suppose it's nice
that Issei has a friend.

261
00:11:10,139 --> 00:11:13,139
So when you say nekkid--you
mean not even skivvies?

262
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:14,106
Of course!

263
00:11:14,139 --> 00:11:15,939
It's more comfortable,
so we sleep better.

264
00:11:15,973 --> 00:11:17,873
And then naturally,
we get better grades!

265
00:11:17,906 --> 00:11:18,573
What are you saying?

266
00:11:18,606 --> 00:11:19,239
They're not gonna fall for that!

267
00:11:19,273 --> 00:11:21,106
That certainly is important.

268
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:21,906
Good job, son...

269
00:11:21,939 --> 00:11:24,106
Glad to see you're
working so hard.

270
00:11:24,139 --> 00:11:24,906
No way...!

271
00:11:24,939 --> 00:11:27,606
What, did she slip
them something?

272
00:11:28,839 --> 00:11:30,773
She messed with their memories!

273
00:11:30,806 --> 00:11:32,806
After a fallen angel
accomplishes her goal,

274
00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:34,906
she erases all memories
and records of herself

275
00:11:34,939 --> 00:11:36,739
from everyone around the target.

276
00:11:36,773 --> 00:11:38,173
Wait. What goal?

277
00:11:38,206 --> 00:11:39,539
You mean Yuma's...?

278
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:40,939
She needed to kill you.

279
00:11:40,973 --> 00:11:42,873
But only after she figured
out whether or not there was

280
00:11:42,906 --> 00:11:46,573
something within you that
was dangerous or threatening.

281
00:11:46,606 --> 00:11:48,006
Once that was verified,

282
00:11:48,039 --> 00:11:49,106
you were stabbed
through the middle

283
00:11:49,139 --> 00:11:51,473
with a spear of light.

284
00:11:52,806 --> 00:11:54,039
If you're looking
for someone to blame,

285
00:11:54,073 --> 00:11:58,539
why not blame Him, he gave
you the Sacred Gear.

286
00:11:58,573 --> 00:12:00,606
That explains the freaky
shit she was saying...

287
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,239
about God and something sacred.

288
00:12:02,273 --> 00:12:04,539
Yes, you have the Sacred Gear.

289
00:12:04,573 --> 00:12:06,839
It's basically a very
intense and unique power

290
00:12:06,873 --> 00:12:08,839
that's found in a rare few.

291
00:12:08,873 --> 00:12:10,206
In fact, the only
people I know of

292
00:12:10,239 --> 00:12:12,506
who have possessed it
are historical figures,

293
00:12:12,539 --> 00:12:15,039
so you're kind of a
big deal around here!

294
00:12:15,073 --> 00:12:16,039
The thing is...

295
00:12:16,073 --> 00:12:18,239
...this power can be so
uncontrollable that some

296
00:12:18,273 --> 00:12:21,106
who have it become a threat
to those in the underworld.

297
00:12:21,139 --> 00:12:24,039
Issei... please hold
up your left hand.

298
00:12:24,073 --> 00:12:25,939
Okay, but I'm not
very good at 'catch.'

299
00:12:25,973 --> 00:12:27,706
Close your eyes and think
of the part of your body

300
00:12:27,739 --> 00:12:29,173
you feel is the strongest.

301
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:30,839
Then focus hard
on that strength.

302
00:12:30,873 --> 00:12:32,039
Wait... So we're doing this now?

303
00:12:32,073 --> 00:12:33,106
That's a lot of pressure.

304
00:12:33,139 --> 00:12:35,073
It will get easier if you focus.

305
00:12:35,106 --> 00:12:36,139
All right!

306
00:12:36,173 --> 00:12:38,797
Focus, focus, foc--

307
00:12:38,797 --> 00:12:39,239
Very good.

308
00:12:39,273 --> 00:12:40,139
Concentrate...

309
00:12:40,173 --> 00:12:42,039
You can do this.

310
00:12:42,073 --> 00:12:44,106
I think, I can.

311
00:12:45,673 --> 00:12:47,573
I'm trying!

312
00:12:47,606 --> 00:12:49,539
Focus...

313
00:12:49,573 --> 00:12:50,006
I can't!

314
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:51,039
I'm a weak soul!

315
00:12:51,073 --> 00:12:52,106
You are not weak at all.

316
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:53,773
It's just a little
hard right now.

317
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:54,939
Um, yeah it's hard...!

318
00:12:54,973 --> 00:12:55,939
The only thing I can focus on

319
00:12:55,973 --> 00:12:57,973
is the fact that your
thong is see-through!

320
00:12:58,006 --> 00:12:59,806
Are you sure this
isn't some mistake?

321
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:01,006
I mean, I'm not that cool.

322
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:03,606
A fallen angel found you threat
enough to try to kill you.

323
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:04,506
It's not a mistake.

324
00:13:04,539 --> 00:13:05,373
Yeah...!

325
00:13:05,406 --> 00:13:06,039
And then she put a
glowing rod in me

326
00:13:06,073 --> 00:13:07,506
and somehow I'm still here.

327
00:13:07,539 --> 00:13:10,039
How does that work?

328
00:13:10,073 --> 00:13:11,173
Do you remember this?

329
00:13:11,206 --> 00:13:12,173
Yeah...

330
00:13:12,206 --> 00:13:14,039
Just before your life
ended you summoned me

331
00:13:14,073 --> 00:13:17,039
with your thoughts
through this flyer.

332
00:13:17,073 --> 00:13:18,306
Summoned?

333
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:21,773
I remember thinking about her
hair and how red it is, but...?

334
00:13:21,806 --> 00:13:23,773
And so, that day
you were revived

335
00:13:23,806 --> 00:13:25,239
and reborn as an
honored member

336
00:13:25,273 --> 00:13:27,806
of the House of Rias Gremory,
daughter of the great

337
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:32,139
and powerful devil,
the Marquis of Gremory.

338
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:35,873
Which means you are
now my devil servant.

339
00:13:39,306 --> 00:13:40,773
I can see better at night ...

340
00:13:40,806 --> 00:13:44,239
I guess that's a plus.

341
00:13:45,306 --> 00:13:47,239
"You're my devil
servant," she says ...

342
00:13:47,273 --> 00:13:48,706
You can't tell me
that doesn't sound like

343
00:13:48,739 --> 00:13:51,006
a skeezy come-on,
in a bondage club.

344
00:13:52,806 --> 00:13:53,906
Isn't this so exciting?

345
00:13:53,939 --> 00:13:56,239
You're really one of us now!

346
00:14:00,906 --> 00:14:02,039
We're glad to have you here...

347
00:14:02,073 --> 00:14:03,506
Welcome, Issei.

348
00:14:03,539 --> 00:14:05,073
Are they for real?

349
00:14:05,106 --> 00:14:06,973
I'm a frikkin devil...?

350
00:14:07,006 --> 00:14:10,173
So my life as a normal
human guy is over?

351
00:14:10,206 --> 00:14:12,006
The way this works
is we grant power

352
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:14,073
to humans for a
price we both agree on

353
00:14:14,106 --> 00:14:15,873
and then seal with a pact.

354
00:14:15,906 --> 00:14:18,806
It used to be that people would
draw magic circles to summon us.

355
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:21,539
But that became too complicated.

356
00:14:21,573 --> 00:14:24,273
Nowadays, we make house calls
and personal deliveries.

357
00:14:24,306 --> 00:14:24,973
Ah...

358
00:14:25,006 --> 00:14:26,106
Makes sense.

359
00:14:26,139 --> 00:14:28,506
Ordinarily we'd have a
messenger demon make the run...

360
00:14:28,539 --> 00:14:30,173
but as a new servant,
I think it'll benefit you

361
00:14:30,206 --> 00:14:33,006
to learn what all
goes into this job.

362
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:34,006
If you do well...

363
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:36,573
...you may get to have a
few servants of your own

364
00:14:36,606 --> 00:14:37,906
to help you in any way you like.

365
00:14:37,939 --> 00:14:38,706
I'm into that!

366
00:14:38,739 --> 00:14:39,706
I want some servants!

367
00:14:39,739 --> 00:14:41,939
Like I said, that all
depends on your efforts.

368
00:14:41,973 --> 00:14:43,739
Let's say my efforts
are awesome...

369
00:14:43,773 --> 00:14:44,606
Does that mean my servants

370
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,573
have to do everything
I tell them to?

371
00:14:46,606 --> 00:14:47,739
That's right.

372
00:14:47,773 --> 00:14:49,606
And they're mine, so I can
do whatever I want to them.

373
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:50,573
Yes.

374
00:14:50,606 --> 00:14:52,773
You know where I'm goin'
with this right...?

375
00:14:52,806 --> 00:14:55,639
It's gonna be sexy time!

376
00:14:55,673 --> 00:14:56,439
The great thing about servants

377
00:14:56,473 --> 00:14:58,639
is you can use
them for anything.

378
00:15:00,573 --> 00:15:03,139
Why would I ever want to
go back to being human?!

379
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:07,173
I'm gonna have a harem!

380
00:15:07,206 --> 00:15:09,239
They'll be naked all the time!

381
00:15:09,273 --> 00:15:12,473
I'm the king of the world!

382
00:15:15,606 --> 00:15:17,739
I finished my delivery!

383
00:15:17,773 --> 00:15:18,739
Nicely done...!

384
00:15:18,773 --> 00:15:20,806
I just have one more job
for you to do today...

385
00:15:20,839 --> 00:15:23,906
Looks like Koneko is double
booked with two summon requests.

386
00:15:23,939 --> 00:15:24,773
Oh.

387
00:15:24,806 --> 00:15:26,806
Take one of them
and get some practice.

388
00:15:26,839 --> 00:15:28,173
That'd be super rad.

389
00:15:28,206 --> 00:15:29,597
Uh, sure.

390
00:15:29,597 --> 00:15:30,039
No problem.

391
00:15:30,073 --> 00:15:31,139
Ma'am.

392
00:15:31,173 --> 00:15:32,706
So does this mean I'm legit?

393
00:15:32,739 --> 00:15:34,739
Am I making a pact?

394
00:15:37,773 --> 00:15:39,806
We call that a
transportation circle...

395
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:41,906
Hold out your left hand
for me, if you would.

396
00:15:41,939 --> 00:15:45,606
Uh... Is it gonna hurt?

397
00:15:47,173 --> 00:15:48,173
This is a seal.

398
00:15:48,206 --> 00:15:49,106
It serves as proof

399
00:15:49,139 --> 00:15:50,873
you're a member of
the House of Gremory...

400
00:15:50,906 --> 00:15:52,206
When you get to
the client's location,

401
00:15:52,239 --> 00:15:54,773
don't panic--just do
exactly as I told you...

402
00:15:54,806 --> 00:15:56,106
You think you're ready for this?

403
00:15:56,139 --> 00:15:56,873
Hell yeah!

404
00:15:56,906 --> 00:15:58,573
Very cute.

405
00:15:58,606 --> 00:16:00,006
All right, make me proud!

406
00:16:00,039 --> 00:16:01,206
I will!

407
00:16:01,239 --> 00:16:04,206
Get this done and I'm one step
closer to having my harem!

408
00:16:14,206 --> 00:16:15,573
The fuck?

409
00:16:15,606 --> 00:16:16,839
Whoopsie!

410
00:16:18,239 --> 00:16:19,639
No, it's okay.

411
00:16:19,673 --> 00:16:20,473
What is?

412
00:16:20,506 --> 00:16:21,506
Looks like you can't
make the jump,

413
00:16:21,539 --> 00:16:22,839
but there's another way.

414
00:16:22,873 --> 00:16:23,839
This sucks balls!

415
00:16:23,873 --> 00:16:26,373
What kind of devil is
summoned on a bicycle?!

416
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:30,839
Okay...

417
00:16:30,873 --> 00:16:32,573
This looks like the place.

418
00:16:33,906 --> 00:16:35,006
Mister Morisawa...!

419
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:36,539
Devil's knockin'
at your door...!

420
00:16:36,573 --> 00:16:37,806
Open up!

421
00:16:39,731 --> 00:16:40,173
Hey!

422
00:16:40,206 --> 00:16:40,939
How's it goin'?!

423
00:16:40,973 --> 00:16:41,739
Get outta here.

424
00:16:41,773 --> 00:16:42,806
No! Come back!
I wasn't kidding!

425
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:45,206
You summoned a devil
and I'm here to hook you up!

426
00:16:45,239 --> 00:16:46,973
Since when does a demon
come to your front door?!

427
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,506
Tonight's your lucky night?

428
00:16:48,539 --> 00:16:49,373
Screw you!

429
00:16:49,406 --> 00:16:50,606
I'm not an idiot--I know
how this works.

430
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:53,873
Koneko always appears out of
the magic circle on this flyer.

431
00:16:53,906 --> 00:16:55,239
She's the one I called for.

432
00:16:55,273 --> 00:16:56,773
Now get off my porch!

433
00:16:56,806 --> 00:16:57,839
Look, I tried, okay?!

434
00:16:57,873 --> 00:16:58,773
And I couldn't do it!

435
00:16:58,806 --> 00:16:59,939
I don't know what happened!

436
00:16:59,973 --> 00:17:01,506
All I know is they
said I had to get here

437
00:17:01,539 --> 00:17:03,073
and then they put me on a bike!

438
00:17:03,106 --> 00:17:05,906
A bike!

439
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:08,039
Okay... fine.

440
00:17:08,939 --> 00:17:10,939
Thank you.

441
00:17:10,973 --> 00:17:12,573
All right, if you're
gonna be the stand-in,

442
00:17:12,606 --> 00:17:13,806
you need to prove yourself.

443
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,839
Show me what cool
devil tricks you got.

444
00:17:15,873 --> 00:17:16,639
Tricks...?

445
00:17:16,673 --> 00:17:17,606
Uh, I dunno.

446
00:17:17,639 --> 00:17:20,939
What kind of tricks
does Koneko usually do?

447
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:22,839
Cosplay...? 'Save the Princess?'

448
00:17:22,873 --> 00:17:23,539
Are you kidding me?!

449
00:17:23,573 --> 00:17:25,139
You summoned a demon for that?

450
00:17:25,173 --> 00:17:26,206
Damn straight...

451
00:17:26,239 --> 00:17:27,139
I've looked everywhere for
another cute young thing

452
00:17:27,173 --> 00:17:29,806
to sweep me off my
feet on a weekly basis,

453
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:31,573
but unless I wanna
grab one off the street...

454
00:17:31,606 --> 00:17:33,539
Yeah, I see your point there.

455
00:17:33,573 --> 00:17:37,839
Uh... she rescues you?

456
00:17:37,873 --> 00:17:38,473
Yeah...

457
00:17:38,506 --> 00:17:39,839
So what can you do for me?

458
00:17:39,873 --> 00:17:42,039
Oh, uh, let's see...

459
00:17:42,073 --> 00:17:45,073
Kame Kame...

460
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:48,073
Ho!

461
00:17:48,106 --> 00:17:48,773
I'm sorry.

462
00:17:48,806 --> 00:17:51,273
I really can't do anything cool.

463
00:17:51,306 --> 00:17:53,573
But you are a fan of the Z?

464
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,839
Or so you think, but all you've
ever seen are the reruns.

465
00:17:56,873 --> 00:17:59,239
My generation caught it all
first look.

466
00:17:59,273 --> 00:18:00,139
Observe.

467
00:18:00,173 --> 00:18:01,939
All first-editions!

468
00:18:03,239 --> 00:18:04,273
Who cares if you saw it first?

469
00:18:04,306 --> 00:18:05,539
That doesn't mean anything!

470
00:18:05,573 --> 00:18:06,739
What?!

471
00:18:06,773 --> 00:18:09,139
I have all the special edition
ones, so you can suck it!

472
00:18:10,173 --> 00:18:11,639
Of course you
don't understand...

473
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:13,773
I remember it came on every
Wednesday night...

474
00:18:13,806 --> 00:18:15,873
I'd have my buddies over and
we'd watch it live-

475
00:18:15,906 --> 00:18:17,006
no DVRing this shit,

476
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:19,739
we caught the first fresh hit
of fusion awesomeness.

477
00:18:19,773 --> 00:18:21,039
Well when my friends
and I played in the park,

478
00:18:21,073 --> 00:18:22,806
we'd call each other the
names of the characters

479
00:18:22,839 --> 00:18:24,606
and turn it into a battleground!

480
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:25,806
And if you don't believe me,

481
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:28,706
I can still pull a Kogu and go
Super Dragon on your ass!

482
00:18:28,739 --> 00:18:31,506
I'd like to see you try,
you PC-Using Pansy!

483
00:18:31,539 --> 00:18:32,173
Okay, that was harsh.

484
00:18:32,206 --> 00:18:33,573
You didn't have to go there.

485
00:18:33,606 --> 00:18:34,739
Slam!

486
00:18:34,773 --> 00:18:36,106
You have to admit that was
a good Dragon yell, though.

487
00:18:36,139 --> 00:18:37,973
Kame Ho!

488
00:18:40,306 --> 00:18:42,273
Do you want to hang out?

489
00:18:42,306 --> 00:18:43,006
Sure.

490
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,539
Why not?

491
00:18:47,006 --> 00:18:47,839
I suck so hard.

492
00:18:47,873 --> 00:18:49,673
I didn't even
end up getting a pact,

493
00:18:49,706 --> 00:18:52,039
just a heated debate
about Dragon Boy Z.

494
00:18:52,073 --> 00:18:54,239
What the hell was
I thinking back there?

495
00:18:57,173 --> 00:18:58,106
Someone's there...

496
00:18:58,139 --> 00:18:59,073
Is it that guy...?

497
00:18:59,106 --> 00:19:00,173
It feels familiar.

498
00:19:00,206 --> 00:19:01,939
What a surprise.

499
00:19:01,973 --> 00:19:03,039
You're not what I thought,

500
00:19:03,073 --> 00:19:05,139
but I'm certain you're
the one I was sent to find.

501
00:19:05,173 --> 00:19:09,539
My name is Karawarner and
I have orders to destroy you.

502
00:19:09,573 --> 00:19:12,106
This is truly unusual.

503
00:19:12,139 --> 00:19:12,939
What's going on?

504
00:19:12,973 --> 00:19:15,506
Why are you still alive?

505
00:19:15,539 --> 00:19:16,873
A fallen angel!

506
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:19,873
She was supposed to have
taken care of this already!

507
00:19:22,539 --> 00:19:24,806
Is that the Gremory
family crest?!

508
00:19:29,239 --> 00:19:31,706
Does this mean I'm
about to be killed again?!

509
00:19:31,739 --> 00:19:34,139
So you're the one Dohnaseek
mistook for a stray.

510
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,073
My, my, isn't that interesting.

511
00:19:36,106 --> 00:19:38,673
The fact that you're a member of
the Gremory household just makes

512
00:19:38,706 --> 00:19:41,873
it all the more important
that you are destroyed!

513
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:44,906
This bitch is
actually gonna kill me!

514
00:19:44,939 --> 00:19:45,573
No!

515
00:19:45,606 --> 00:19:46,373
That power they said I have!

516
00:19:46,406 --> 00:19:48,206
I need to figure
out how to use it!

517
00:19:48,239 --> 00:19:51,039
Think of the part of you
that you feel is strongest.

518
00:19:51,073 --> 00:19:52,539
And if you don't believe me...

519
00:19:52,573 --> 00:19:55,806
I can pull a Kogu and go
Super Dragon on your ass!

520
00:19:55,839 --> 00:19:57,806
You just have to focus.

521
00:19:57,839 --> 00:20:00,206
I can do the Dragon yell!

522
00:20:00,973 --> 00:20:03,106
Focus!

523
00:20:15,606 --> 00:20:18,673
Is that... the Sacred Gear?

524
00:20:18,706 --> 00:20:20,139
I've got better things to do...

525
00:20:20,173 --> 00:20:23,173
I'm going to let someone
else deal with this crap.

526
00:20:25,606 --> 00:20:28,239
So what's the
Sacred Gear... this?

527
00:20:28,273 --> 00:20:29,506
Yes.

528
00:20:29,539 --> 00:20:31,673
Congratulations,
you've found it.

529
00:20:31,706 --> 00:20:34,639
Now that it's been activated,
all you have to do is decide

530
00:20:34,673 --> 00:20:37,206
when you want to
turn it on or off.

531
00:20:37,239 --> 00:20:38,339
Thank goodness.

532
00:20:38,373 --> 00:20:40,239
That was really gonna slow
me down in my alone time.

533
00:20:40,273 --> 00:20:41,873
I'm so proud of you, Issei!

534
00:20:41,906 --> 00:20:42,806
You are?

535
00:20:42,839 --> 00:20:43,673
Thanks!

536
00:20:43,706 --> 00:20:45,539
This does put me
in a strange position.

537
00:20:45,573 --> 00:20:46,773
The fallen angels now know...

538
00:20:46,806 --> 00:20:48,573
Not only are you still alive,

539
00:20:48,606 --> 00:20:50,073
but you've been
reborn as one of us;

540
00:20:50,106 --> 00:20:52,973
which is bound to make things
more complicated around here.

541
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,019
Yeah...

542
00:20:54,052 --> 00:20:55,452
I'm so sorry.

543
00:20:55,485 --> 00:20:57,952
I know it was just an
accident that you ran into her.

544
00:20:57,985 --> 00:20:58,885
But remember...

545
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:00,119
Don't get carried away now

546
00:21:00,152 --> 00:21:01,285
that you've unlocked
the Sacred Gear

547
00:21:01,319 --> 00:21:02,519
and try to fight them alone.

548
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:04,285
That's disrespectful
to the rest of us.

549
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:06,077
I understand.

550
00:21:06,077 --> 00:21:06,519
Thank you...

551
00:21:06,552 --> 00:21:07,519
I'm tired.

552
00:21:07,552 --> 00:21:09,052
I'm gonna go home.

553
00:21:15,285 --> 00:21:17,419
Exaggeration much?

554
00:21:17,452 --> 00:21:18,119
He's still new.

555
00:21:18,152 --> 00:21:19,452
Why do you have to scare him?

556
00:21:19,485 --> 00:21:21,185
I'm not trying to scare him...

557
00:21:21,219 --> 00:21:23,952
I just don't want him
to overestimate himself.

558
00:21:25,219 --> 00:21:26,119
Plus...

559
00:21:26,152 --> 00:21:28,119
I will not let any
of those angel rejects

560
00:21:28,152 --> 00:21:30,852
take my new favorite
servant from me.

561
00:21:33,952 --> 00:21:34,885
Wake up...!

562
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:36,419
It's time to get out of bed...!

563
00:21:36,452 --> 00:21:38,119
If you don't, I'll kill you!

564
00:21:38,152 --> 00:21:39,785
Because I'm the Tickle Monster

565
00:21:39,819 --> 00:21:40,952
and I'm coming to get you...!

566
00:21:40,985 --> 00:21:42,752
Tickle tickle tickle!

567
00:21:44,252 --> 00:21:46,452
I messed everything up!

568
00:21:49,785 --> 00:21:53,085
What am I supposed to do if
she's still pissed off at me...?

569
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:55,885
Why am I an idiot?

570
00:22:00,185 --> 00:22:00,852
Oh no.

571
00:22:00,885 --> 00:22:02,485
It looks like I fell down again.

572
00:22:02,519 --> 00:22:04,185
I'm such a klutz.

573
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:14,586
Whoa...

574
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:15,920
Who's that?

575
00:23:48,354 --> 00:23:51,775
I'm a little bit lost, do you
think you could help me out?

576
00:23:52,815 --> 00:23:54,049
Just watch and learn...

577
00:23:54,082 --> 00:23:57,249
Pay close attention to my devils
as they do battle here tonight.

578
00:23:57,282 --> 00:23:59,282
Freed Sellzen here,
at your service.

579
00:23:59,315 --> 00:24:00,249
Kerblam!

580
00:24:00,282 --> 00:24:02,682
Whatever you do, please
don't disappoint me.
