1
00:00:18,533 --> 00:00:20,433
Red.

2
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,466
The same color as her hair...

3
00:00:25,733 --> 00:00:28,733
Darker than any
red hair I've ever seen...

4
00:00:28,766 --> 00:00:31,733
Just like the color
running down my hand.

5
00:00:34,166 --> 00:00:36,600
Long, beautiful crimson hair...

6
00:00:36,633 --> 00:00:39,466
Just... like this.

7
00:00:40,566 --> 00:00:42,133
Not today...

8
00:00:42,166 --> 00:00:44,100
I will not let you die.

9
00:00:47,854 --> 00:00:51,121
I gotta say, boobs
are the best thing ever.

10
00:00:51,154 --> 00:00:54,054
Trust me, my man, you
and I are on the same page!

11
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:55,187
Me too...

12
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:57,054
But it's all pointless.

13
00:00:58,121 --> 00:01:00,221
Matsuda...? Motohama?

14
00:01:00,254 --> 00:01:01,587
Can you guys
tell me why the hell

15
00:01:01,621 --> 00:01:04,021
we enrolled in
this school again?

16
00:01:04,054 --> 00:01:05,454
Like you don't know...

17
00:01:05,487 --> 00:01:06,521
We're in a place that

18
00:01:06,554 --> 00:01:09,821
up until a few years ago
was nuthin' but chicks...

19
00:01:10,587 --> 00:01:13,754
We had to take advantage
of this male to female ratio.

20
00:01:13,787 --> 00:01:16,587
Also, the foreign exchange
students here are ridiculous.

21
00:01:16,621 --> 00:01:18,721
Poon as far as
the eye could see!

22
00:01:18,754 --> 00:01:21,221
We figured hos'd be linin'
up to get on our jocks,

23
00:01:21,254 --> 00:01:23,154
and we wouldn't have
to do a damn thing!

24
00:01:23,187 --> 00:01:25,187
We'd be drowning in that stank!

25
00:01:25,221 --> 00:01:27,854
Like our very own harem!

26
00:01:28,754 --> 00:01:30,454
Hell yeah! We were
gonna have casual,

27
00:01:30,487 --> 00:01:33,554
unprotected sex with hot chicks
and then never call them again!

28
00:01:33,587 --> 00:01:35,954
One, two! One, two! One, two!

29
00:01:35,987 --> 00:01:37,021
That was the plan anyway.

30
00:01:37,054 --> 00:01:38,121
But here we are,

31
00:01:38,154 --> 00:01:39,387
up against the spring
semester of our second year,

32
00:01:39,421 --> 00:01:43,554
and between the three of us, we
don't even have one girlfriend.

33
00:01:43,587 --> 00:01:44,621
What's the point?

34
00:01:44,654 --> 00:01:45,921
It'll never happen.

35
00:01:45,954 --> 00:01:47,121
No, we can't give up now!

36
00:01:47,154 --> 00:01:49,421
It's not too late for us!

37
00:01:52,587 --> 00:01:53,554
Kiba, wait up...!

38
00:01:53,587 --> 00:01:54,921
What are you doing right now?

39
00:01:54,954 --> 00:01:57,754
Yeah... you maybe wanna
go sing karaoke with us?

40
00:01:57,787 --> 00:01:58,621
Thanks...

41
00:01:58,654 --> 00:01:59,787
But I've gotta
meeting with my club.

42
00:01:59,821 --> 00:02:00,821
Aww...

43
00:02:00,854 --> 00:02:01,654
That sucks.

44
00:02:01,687 --> 00:02:03,154
I really do wish
I could go, though;

45
00:02:03,187 --> 00:02:05,987
it's very cool of you
ladies to invite me.

46
00:02:07,754 --> 00:02:09,987
Kiba Yuto. Class 2-C...

47
00:02:10,021 --> 00:02:12,654
Basically every girl in this
school wants to sex him up.

48
00:02:12,687 --> 00:02:14,654
And every guy wants
to mess him up!

49
00:02:14,687 --> 00:02:15,587
That tool...!

50
00:02:15,621 --> 00:02:16,521
I don't get it...

51
00:02:16,554 --> 00:02:17,787
Just cause he's hot,
sexy, really smart,

52
00:02:17,821 --> 00:02:20,854
and the coolest guy in school,
they all wanna rub up on Kiba?!

53
00:02:20,887 --> 00:02:23,121
He sucks so much
less than we do.

54
00:02:23,154 --> 00:02:24,854
Life really does blow sometimes.

55
00:02:24,887 --> 00:02:25,354
Oh shit...

56
00:02:25,387 --> 00:02:26,621
I'm gonna be late!

57
00:02:26,654 --> 00:02:30,154
Huh...? Gonna be late for what?

58
00:02:32,954 --> 00:02:33,987
Murayama's jugs.

59
00:02:34,021 --> 00:02:35,521
They're frickin' huge!

60
00:02:35,554 --> 00:02:37,487
36... 22... 34.

61
00:02:37,521 --> 00:02:39,887
And Katase's
legs are crazy sexy!

62
00:02:39,921 --> 00:02:42,521
34... 22... 36.

63
00:02:42,554 --> 00:02:43,754
Found this yesterday.

64
00:02:43,787 --> 00:02:45,021
I call it the 'tit hole.'

65
00:02:45,054 --> 00:02:46,654
Good job, Matsuda!

66
00:02:46,687 --> 00:02:47,521
I have to admit,
your scouting...

67
00:02:47,554 --> 00:02:48,954
Guys, my turn...!

68
00:02:48,987 --> 00:02:50,487
Come on, no fair!

69
00:02:50,521 --> 00:02:51,654
Ooo, check that out!

70
00:02:51,687 --> 00:02:53,654
She's so hot!

71
00:02:55,087 --> 00:02:56,221
What was that?

72
00:02:56,254 --> 00:02:58,187
Dude, run!

73
00:03:01,921 --> 00:03:04,021
Can't believe those
two idiots left me here!

74
00:03:04,054 --> 00:03:05,521
Guys!

75
00:03:07,587 --> 00:03:09,621
Well, well, what a surprise.

76
00:03:09,654 --> 00:03:10,521
No...

77
00:03:10,554 --> 00:03:11,487
Wait.

78
00:03:11,521 --> 00:03:13,787
Please... Don't hurt me.

79
00:03:13,821 --> 00:03:15,487
Issei, you perv!

80
00:03:16,987 --> 00:03:17,887
I still think attacking me

81
00:03:17,921 --> 00:03:20,487
with bamboo swords
was a little extreme.

82
00:03:20,521 --> 00:03:22,521
Did you at least
get to see some nip?

83
00:03:22,554 --> 00:03:24,021
No, I didn't get
to see any nip...!

84
00:03:24,054 --> 00:03:25,621
I was too busy getting
my ass handed to me

85
00:03:25,654 --> 00:03:26,821
for looking through a tit hole

86
00:03:26,854 --> 00:03:29,721
I didn't even get to look
through cause of you a-holes!

87
00:03:42,654 --> 00:03:44,454
Did you guys see that honey...?

88
00:03:44,487 --> 00:03:46,621
Her sugar has got to be sweet.

89
00:03:46,654 --> 00:03:47,887
True that...

90
00:03:47,921 --> 00:03:50,021
What is it about red hair...?

91
00:03:50,054 --> 00:03:52,521
Her name's Rias Gremory.

92
00:03:52,554 --> 00:03:55,687
36... 24... 36...

93
00:03:55,721 --> 00:03:58,154
She's President of the
Occult Research Club...

94
00:03:58,187 --> 00:04:00,921
Word around the school is
she's from Northern Europe.

95
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:07,021
Who was that boy?

96
00:04:07,054 --> 00:04:08,121
What boy?

97
00:04:08,154 --> 00:04:10,454
The kid who was
sitting in the middle.

98
00:04:10,487 --> 00:04:12,887
Well... I think
he's in Class 2-B...

99
00:04:12,921 --> 00:04:16,021
If I remember right,
his name's Issei Hyodo...

100
00:04:16,054 --> 00:04:17,987
Why, what makes
you ask about him?

101
00:04:18,021 --> 00:04:19,154
Oh, nothing...

102
00:04:19,187 --> 00:04:21,621
I just wondered if you knew
who he was, that's all...

103
00:04:21,654 --> 00:04:24,421
Ah. Checkmate.

104
00:04:28,921 --> 00:04:32,187
Your trap was very
easy to see through.

105
00:04:37,787 --> 00:04:40,787
Sorry, I did my best
to make it harder on you.

106
00:04:40,821 --> 00:04:42,554
Thanks.

107
00:04:42,587 --> 00:04:44,487
I look forward to next time.

108
00:05:25,154 --> 00:05:26,887
Being a teenager's the worst...

109
00:05:26,921 --> 00:05:28,954
At this rate, jerking off
to porn is the closest

110
00:05:28,987 --> 00:05:31,454
I'll ever get to 'doing it'
before I go off to college,

111
00:05:31,487 --> 00:05:34,821
which means I'll be a
virgin forever and die alone.

112
00:05:36,021 --> 00:05:37,787
Excuse me?

113
00:05:37,821 --> 00:05:40,921
You're Issei Hyodo
from Kuo Academy, right?

114
00:05:40,954 --> 00:05:43,121
Or am I wrong?

115
00:05:44,654 --> 00:05:46,154
Yeah.

116
00:05:47,587 --> 00:05:49,021
I don't recognize that uniform.

117
00:05:49,054 --> 00:05:50,687
What school's she from...?

118
00:05:50,721 --> 00:05:52,554
Who cares?! She's fine!

119
00:05:52,587 --> 00:05:54,054
Hi! I uh--

120
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:55,054
Um...

121
00:05:55,087 --> 00:05:56,921
Hey, if there's anything
I can help you with...

122
00:05:56,954 --> 00:05:58,921
Sort of.

123
00:06:00,154 --> 00:06:02,787
I just wanted to ask
you a quick question:

124
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:04,987
Are you seeing anyone right now?

125
00:06:05,021 --> 00:06:06,587
Now? No...

126
00:06:06,621 --> 00:06:08,021
That's wonderful!

127
00:06:08,054 --> 00:06:09,021
It is?

128
00:06:09,054 --> 00:06:11,987
Uh... In that case...
Since you're single...

129
00:06:12,021 --> 00:06:14,721
Do you think you'd
like to go out with me?

130
00:06:14,754 --> 00:06:17,821
Go out with you...? Um, I...

131
00:06:17,854 --> 00:06:19,087
I've been watching...

132
00:06:19,121 --> 00:06:21,987
You pass by here a lot
and you seem so...

133
00:06:22,021 --> 00:06:23,454
I don't know...

134
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:24,487
Gentle...

135
00:06:24,521 --> 00:06:26,687
And very handsome and I--

136
00:06:26,721 --> 00:06:29,087
This cannot be
happening to me right now.

137
00:06:29,121 --> 00:06:30,187
See...

138
00:06:30,221 --> 00:06:32,454
The thing is--

139
00:06:34,654 --> 00:06:37,554
I'd like for you
to be my boyfriend!

140
00:06:38,754 --> 00:06:41,087
I...

141
00:06:41,121 --> 00:06:41,887
Whoa!

142
00:06:41,921 --> 00:06:44,687
Is this for real?!

143
00:06:47,938 --> 00:06:50,405
Wake up, please, would
you please wake up now?

144
00:06:50,438 --> 00:06:52,038
Or...

145
00:06:52,071 --> 00:06:53,371
You could just stay in bed...

146
00:06:53,405 --> 00:06:54,338
But...

147
00:06:54,371 --> 00:06:56,105
I'm not going down on you.

148
00:06:56,138 --> 00:06:57,838
Wake up, mister!
Wake up, mister!

149
00:06:57,871 --> 00:06:59,271
Wake up, mister!

150
00:07:04,338 --> 00:07:05,705
No... Please God...

151
00:07:05,738 --> 00:07:07,738
But--

152
00:07:07,771 --> 00:07:10,838
Guys, this is Yumo
Amano my girlfriend...

153
00:07:10,871 --> 00:07:13,738
And these are my good buds
Matsuda and Motohama.

154
00:07:13,771 --> 00:07:15,138
It's nice to meet you.

155
00:07:15,738 --> 00:07:17,271
And here's the best part, dudes.

156
00:07:17,305 --> 00:07:20,171
She... Asked... Me.

157
00:07:20,205 --> 00:07:23,171
Hey... Stop whackin' it,
and you'll find one, too!

158
00:07:23,205 --> 00:07:24,305
Come on... Let's go, Yuma!

159
00:07:24,338 --> 00:07:25,871
Kay!

160
00:07:29,138 --> 00:07:31,605
Dude... He betrayed us!

161
00:07:33,838 --> 00:07:34,838
Go out?

162
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:35,405
Yeah...

163
00:07:35,438 --> 00:07:37,305
Next Sunday afternoon...

164
00:07:37,338 --> 00:07:38,305
Can you do it?!

165
00:07:38,338 --> 00:07:39,171
Sure...!

166
00:07:39,205 --> 00:07:40,271
That sounds great...!

167
00:07:40,305 --> 00:07:41,971
I can do it anytime you want!

168
00:07:42,005 --> 00:07:44,405
It's a date then... Night.

169
00:07:44,438 --> 00:07:46,705
Yeah... You too!

170
00:07:48,771 --> 00:07:52,871
I really am happy
you're my boyfriend!

171
00:07:52,905 --> 00:07:53,638
Ditto...

172
00:07:53,671 --> 00:07:55,338
Bye, bye.

173
00:07:58,305 --> 00:07:59,671
A date, a date!

174
00:07:59,705 --> 00:08:01,005
This is bad ass!

175
00:08:01,038 --> 00:08:02,938
I am so gonna see lady parts!

176
00:08:02,971 --> 00:08:04,638
I am the man!

177
00:08:13,738 --> 00:08:15,205
I see.

178
00:08:15,238 --> 00:08:17,405
You were right,
one hundred percent.

179
00:08:17,438 --> 00:08:19,838
Yeah, you totally called it.

180
00:08:19,871 --> 00:08:22,805
I'm just glad I asked you two
to keep a close eye on him.

181
00:08:22,838 --> 00:08:23,805
Yep.

182
00:08:23,838 --> 00:08:24,705
What's next...?

183
00:08:24,738 --> 00:08:26,071
What do we do with him now?

184
00:08:26,105 --> 00:08:28,938
We need to make our
preparations immediately...

185
00:08:28,971 --> 00:08:30,638
That's all we can do...

186
00:08:30,671 --> 00:08:32,805
Everything else depends on him.

187
00:08:38,705 --> 00:08:40,705
She should have gotten here
by now. Shouldn't she?

188
00:08:40,738 --> 00:08:42,671
Here, take a flyer.

189
00:08:47,271 --> 00:08:49,338
Oh goody, wonder
what this about?

190
00:08:49,371 --> 00:08:51,971
'Your wish will be granted', eh?

191
00:08:52,005 --> 00:08:52,938
Yeah right...

192
00:08:52,971 --> 00:08:54,671
If only that were true.

193
00:08:54,705 --> 00:08:56,638
Issei... Hey!

194
00:08:56,671 --> 00:08:58,005
Oh, cool! You made it!

195
00:08:58,038 --> 00:08:59,405
Sorry to keep you waiting.

196
00:08:59,438 --> 00:09:00,271
No... Please.

197
00:09:00,305 --> 00:09:02,738
I'm just glad you came.

198
00:09:02,938 --> 00:09:06,205
I've always wanted
to say that to a chick!

199
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:42,071
Are you all right?

200
00:09:46,205 --> 00:09:47,638
Take this!

201
00:09:48,938 --> 00:09:50,205
I sure had fun today.

202
00:09:50,238 --> 00:09:50,871
Yeah...

203
00:09:50,905 --> 00:09:52,738
This was the best date ever!

204
00:09:56,438 --> 00:09:57,338
Dude...

205
00:09:57,371 --> 00:09:59,938
I think this is my
chance to make a move!

206
00:10:03,038 --> 00:10:05,005
I'm touching her!

207
00:10:11,338 --> 00:10:14,038
Can I ask you a question?

208
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:16,105
In honor of our first
date there's something

209
00:10:16,138 --> 00:10:20,205
I'd like you to do... to
commemorate this special moment.

210
00:10:20,238 --> 00:10:21,371
I'm gonna get to kiss her.

211
00:10:21,405 --> 00:10:23,105
I'm totally gonna
get to kiss her.

212
00:10:23,138 --> 00:10:24,671
This rocks!

213
00:10:24,705 --> 00:10:25,505
Sure...

214
00:10:25,538 --> 00:10:28,038
You can ask me
for anything at all.

215
00:10:29,938 --> 00:10:32,005
Would you die for me?

216
00:10:33,771 --> 00:10:34,671
What'd you say...?

217
00:10:34,705 --> 00:10:35,571
Sorry...

218
00:10:35,605 --> 00:10:37,005
Something must be
wrong with my ears;

219
00:10:37,038 --> 00:10:38,338
I don't think
I heard you correctly.

220
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:42,271
Could you maybe say
that one more time please?

221
00:10:42,871 --> 00:10:45,105
I want you to die for me.

222
00:10:48,205 --> 00:10:49,405
Breasticles!

223
00:10:49,438 --> 00:10:50,705
Those are boobs...

224
00:10:50,738 --> 00:10:52,205
I am looking at boobs.

225
00:10:52,238 --> 00:10:54,838
My little boy eyes have
finally grown into manhood!

226
00:10:54,871 --> 00:10:57,105
And she's a super
hot chick too...!

227
00:10:57,138 --> 00:10:58,138
What's that old saying?

228
00:10:58,171 --> 00:10:59,938
'This is a sight
for sore eyes'...

229
00:10:59,971 --> 00:11:03,905
This is totally a sight
for--wait, no it's not...

230
00:11:03,938 --> 00:11:06,305
She looks like a demon.

231
00:11:06,338 --> 00:11:07,838
Are those wings?

232
00:11:07,871 --> 00:11:09,238
Well, I have to admit...

233
00:11:09,271 --> 00:11:11,205
I did have some fun today...

234
00:11:11,238 --> 00:11:13,638
Considering how naive
and childish you are,

235
00:11:13,671 --> 00:11:15,771
things could have
been much, much worse...

236
00:11:15,805 --> 00:11:17,738
Thanks a lot for the gift too...

237
00:11:17,771 --> 00:11:19,038
Very sweet...

238
00:11:19,071 --> 00:11:20,938
But... even so.

239
00:11:25,405 --> 00:11:26,205
Yuma, wait...

240
00:11:26,238 --> 00:11:26,705
Please--

241
00:11:26,738 --> 00:11:28,905
It's time to die.

242
00:11:34,705 --> 00:11:35,871
I'm sorry.

243
00:11:35,905 --> 00:11:38,838
But the fact is, you were
far too great a risk to us...

244
00:11:38,871 --> 00:11:41,805
I had no choice
but to dispose of you.

245
00:11:41,838 --> 00:11:43,171
If you're looking
for someone to blame,

246
00:11:43,205 --> 00:11:44,371
why not blame Him?

247
00:11:44,405 --> 00:11:47,338
He gave you the Sacred Gear.

248
00:11:47,371 --> 00:11:50,071
What in the hell
is she talking about?

249
00:11:51,971 --> 00:11:54,638
Oh... Thanks again
for the lovely date...

250
00:11:54,671 --> 00:11:56,638
It was fun.

251
00:11:58,738 --> 00:12:00,705
What a bitch.

252
00:12:01,271 --> 00:12:04,238
Am I really about
to die like this?.

253
00:12:04,271 --> 00:12:06,305
Alone and pathetic...

254
00:12:06,338 --> 00:12:08,305
And a giant virgin...?

255
00:12:09,405 --> 00:12:11,738
If you were gonna kill me...

256
00:12:11,771 --> 00:12:15,738
Couldn't you have let me squeeze
your jiggle-y jugs first?

257
00:12:17,138 --> 00:12:19,838
I only got to look at
them for a second...

258
00:12:19,871 --> 00:12:22,771
But I could see how
bouncy they were...

259
00:12:22,805 --> 00:12:25,638
Oh, Yuma...

260
00:12:25,671 --> 00:12:26,771
Red.

261
00:12:26,805 --> 00:12:29,205
The same color as her hair.

262
00:12:29,238 --> 00:12:32,171
Darker than any red
hair I've ever seen...

263
00:12:32,205 --> 00:12:35,038
Just like the color
running down my hand.

264
00:12:35,071 --> 00:12:37,905
Long, beautiful crimson hair...

265
00:12:37,938 --> 00:12:41,105
Just... like this.

266
00:12:42,238 --> 00:12:44,838
Wait, why the crap am
I talking like this...?

267
00:12:44,871 --> 00:12:47,105
I'm about to freakin' die.

268
00:12:48,738 --> 00:12:50,871
It's over... Damn...

269
00:12:50,905 --> 00:12:52,805
I can't even move anymore...

270
00:12:52,838 --> 00:12:54,705
Trying to touch
a pair of orbs...

271
00:12:54,738 --> 00:12:57,605
What a stupid way
for a person to die .

272
00:12:58,971 --> 00:13:02,105
To be honest, I know
I've lived a shallow life...

273
00:13:02,138 --> 00:13:05,371
Next time around I'm gonna try
real hard to be a better person.

274
00:13:05,405 --> 00:13:08,605
The only thing
I can think about is Rias.

275
00:13:09,671 --> 00:13:11,271
With her pretty red hair...

276
00:13:11,305 --> 00:13:13,638
And huge kazongas...

277
00:13:13,671 --> 00:13:15,671
If I'm going to die,
then why can't

278
00:13:15,705 --> 00:13:19,138
I do it motor-boating
those glorious fun bags.

279
00:13:33,805 --> 00:13:35,071
I have come...

280
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:37,805
You're the one who
summoned me, are you not?

281
00:13:37,838 --> 00:13:39,638
Wh-Who is that?

282
00:13:41,305 --> 00:13:43,005
Since death is upon you...

283
00:13:43,038 --> 00:13:45,271
I will gladly take you in.

284
00:13:46,271 --> 00:13:49,338
Whoa, she has wings too.

285
00:13:49,371 --> 00:13:51,805
From this moment forward...

286
00:13:51,838 --> 00:13:54,938
You will live your
life for my sake.

287
00:14:07,516 --> 00:14:10,183
Wake up or
I shall kill you dead.

288
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:11,149
Wake up, bitch...

289
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:13,216
Or I'll chop off your balls.

290
00:14:14,283 --> 00:14:16,049
I'm so tired...

291
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:16,816
Man...

292
00:14:16,849 --> 00:14:18,016
This stupid thing...

293
00:14:18,049 --> 00:14:20,283
Gives me the weirdest dreams.

294
00:14:22,049 --> 00:14:23,316
Hold on.

295
00:14:23,349 --> 00:14:24,583
Stop screwing with me, guys;

296
00:14:24,616 --> 00:14:26,583
you seriously don't
remember meeting Yuma?

297
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:29,149
Naw dude name's
not ringin' any bells.

298
00:14:29,183 --> 00:14:31,316
I'll say it again:
you never introduced us

299
00:14:31,349 --> 00:14:34,116
to a chick and it's impossible
that you have a girlfriend.

300
00:14:34,149 --> 00:14:35,316
But that doesn't
make any sense...

301
00:14:35,349 --> 00:14:37,883
Her email address
is right here--

302
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:38,883
No way...

303
00:14:38,916 --> 00:14:42,849
Yuma's contact
information's not in my phone.

304
00:14:42,883 --> 00:14:44,416
What in the hell...?

305
00:14:50,316 --> 00:14:51,883
Big boobies, twelve o'clock.

306
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:53,849
Rias?

307
00:14:53,883 --> 00:14:55,116
She's so awesome!

308
00:14:55,149 --> 00:14:57,916
Like, totally gorgeous!

309
00:15:11,316 --> 00:15:13,416
Filing that image
away for later.

310
00:15:13,449 --> 00:15:14,549
There's just
something about her,

311
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:17,949
she's like a naughty,
red-headed princess you know?

312
00:15:19,183 --> 00:15:21,116
Hey, maybe you've been
watching too much porn

313
00:15:21,149 --> 00:15:22,183
and it's making you cray-cray!

314
00:15:22,216 --> 00:15:24,149
Look, I'm not crazy;
I know what happened, okay?!

315
00:15:24,183 --> 00:15:25,383
Relax.

316
00:15:25,416 --> 00:15:27,116
Just come by my place after
school today and we'll hang out

317
00:15:27,149 --> 00:15:33,383
and watch my treasured
collection-Of DVD porn!

318
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:34,349
They're so gross.

319
00:15:34,383 --> 00:15:36,116
Losers.

320
00:15:36,149 --> 00:15:37,549
Anyway, I just got
a new disc called

321
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:39,349
'Double Ds and the
Nerds who love them'

322
00:15:39,383 --> 00:15:40,616
That sounds awesome!

323
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:42,849
Didn't you say you also got the
latest Gentlemen's Disc release?

324
00:15:42,883 --> 00:15:44,216
So weird...

325
00:15:44,249 --> 00:15:46,016
Transform!

326
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:51,216
Ooo...! This is Momo's latest
video Kaben Rider Pinky!

327
00:15:51,249 --> 00:15:52,049
Sure is...

328
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:54,316
I had to pull
some major strings.

329
00:15:54,349 --> 00:15:56,383
Man, this is so weird...

330
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:59,349
How could it have been a dream
when the memories feel so real,

331
00:15:59,383 --> 00:16:01,416
like they just
happened yesterday?

332
00:16:01,449 --> 00:16:02,416
Plus, if it never happened,

333
00:16:02,449 --> 00:16:05,083
where did my memories
of the real two days go?

334
00:16:05,116 --> 00:16:06,049
Yo!

335
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:07,516
What the hell's wrong
with you, Issei...?

336
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:09,949
You are a Momozono
Momo fan, aren't you?!

337
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:10,416
Uh.

338
00:16:10,449 --> 00:16:11,883
Heeeey, uhh...

339
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:13,283
Let's turn off the lights,

340
00:16:13,316 --> 00:16:15,583
it's way too bright in
here, I can't concentrate!

341
00:16:15,616 --> 00:16:17,116
Yeah, that's way better!

342
00:16:17,149 --> 00:16:18,416
I know!

343
00:16:18,449 --> 00:16:19,883
Dude, look at that mount!

344
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:21,916
Guys, the lights are still on.

345
00:16:21,949 --> 00:16:22,449
Wait.

346
00:16:22,483 --> 00:16:23,516
What'd you just say?

347
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:24,416
The lights in the room,

348
00:16:24,449 --> 00:16:25,883
I thought you were
gonna turn 'em off.

349
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:26,716
Huh?

350
00:16:26,749 --> 00:16:28,549
What are you talking
about, broseph?!

351
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:29,983
No, I'm wrong...

352
00:16:30,016 --> 00:16:31,916
They are off.

353
00:16:32,349 --> 00:16:33,883
I don't see any light...

354
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:35,249
But I know I sense it...

355
00:16:35,283 --> 00:16:36,916
I do.

356
00:16:38,616 --> 00:16:41,416
Sorry.

357
00:16:41,449 --> 00:16:42,516
I'm going home.

358
00:16:42,549 --> 00:16:43,216
Hey!

359
00:16:43,249 --> 00:16:45,783
What's wrong, are you all right?

360
00:16:52,983 --> 00:16:54,183
I'm not nuts...

361
00:16:54,216 --> 00:16:56,383
My eyes are freaking out on me.

362
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:57,883
This is weird...

363
00:16:57,916 --> 00:16:59,583
I feel so different...

364
00:16:59,616 --> 00:17:02,083
Like there's something
inside me that's changing.

365
00:17:02,116 --> 00:17:04,016
No, Mommy, buy it!

366
00:17:04,049 --> 00:17:06,416
If you don't stop acting like a
spoiled brat, you're grounded!

367
00:17:06,449 --> 00:17:08,583
No! No!

368
00:17:08,616 --> 00:17:09,483
It doesn't make sense,

369
00:17:09,516 --> 00:17:12,016
how can I hear them
from so far away?!

370
00:17:13,216 --> 00:17:14,416
What's happening to me...?

371
00:17:14,449 --> 00:17:17,416
Why is my body doing this?!

372
00:17:19,183 --> 00:17:21,149
I've been here before.

373
00:17:24,249 --> 00:17:25,049
Yes...

374
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:26,349
This is it.

375
00:17:26,383 --> 00:17:27,849
This is the park
where I took Yuma

376
00:17:27,883 --> 00:17:30,049
when we went on our first date.

377
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:32,216
It was real...

378
00:17:32,249 --> 00:17:34,449
It couldn't have been a dream...

379
00:17:34,483 --> 00:17:37,283
I remember every
single thing about it.

380
00:17:39,616 --> 00:17:42,783
What the hell was that?

381
00:17:43,549 --> 00:17:46,383
Well, this really
is unfortunate.

382
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:48,016
Me running into you, that is...

383
00:17:48,049 --> 00:17:49,183
Oh man...

384
00:17:49,216 --> 00:17:53,083
Why won't my body stop shaking?

385
00:18:02,249 --> 00:18:05,016
I meant to back up
a little, not jump!

386
00:18:05,049 --> 00:18:07,249
Looking for a way out?

387
00:18:07,283 --> 00:18:09,549
I don't understand
what's happening to me?!

388
00:18:11,616 --> 00:18:13,083
Feathers?

389
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:14,849
Yuma?!

390
00:18:20,916 --> 00:18:21,716
Such cowardice.

391
00:18:21,749 --> 00:18:23,916
I can't abide
lower-class beings.

392
00:18:23,949 --> 00:18:24,516
No...

393
00:18:24,549 --> 00:18:27,049
How can this be real!

394
00:18:27,516 --> 00:18:28,816
So let's see...

395
00:18:28,849 --> 00:18:30,016
It appears as
though your friends

396
00:18:30,049 --> 00:18:32,049
and master are
nowhere to be found...

397
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:33,949
You show no signs
of disappearing,

398
00:18:33,983 --> 00:18:36,116
nor are any magic
circles being deployed...

399
00:18:36,149 --> 00:18:38,083
Therefore I will assume
that you are nothing

400
00:18:38,116 --> 00:18:40,216
but a 'stray,' is that correct?

401
00:18:41,883 --> 00:18:44,883
And that would mean...
Killing you won't be a problem!

402
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:45,883
If I'm gonna die in a dream,

403
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:48,216
I'd rather be killed by
a hot chick than a dude!

404
00:18:48,249 --> 00:18:52,049
Not cool!

405
00:18:53,449 --> 00:18:54,816
Man, this blows...!

406
00:18:54,849 --> 00:18:55,749
Big time...!

407
00:18:55,783 --> 00:18:57,416
This is the worst
pain I've ever felt!.

408
00:18:57,449 --> 00:18:58,316
It didn't hurt near this bad

409
00:18:58,349 --> 00:19:02,016
when Yuma murdered
me in my last dream.

410
00:19:03,049 --> 00:19:04,283
Hurts, doesn't it...?

411
00:19:04,316 --> 00:19:06,583
Light is a deadly
poison to your kind;

412
00:19:06,616 --> 00:19:08,149
it burns you from within...

413
00:19:08,183 --> 00:19:09,383
I thought I'd finished you off,

414
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:12,183
but it seems you're
quite the tough one.

415
00:19:12,216 --> 00:19:13,349
Don't worry though...

416
00:19:13,383 --> 00:19:16,116
I'll put you out of
your misery shortly.

417
00:19:16,149 --> 00:19:17,283
I'm done for...

418
00:19:17,316 --> 00:19:18,216
Someone...

419
00:19:18,249 --> 00:19:19,883
Help me, please!

420
00:19:21,849 --> 00:19:24,016
What did you just do,
you little shit...?!

421
00:19:24,049 --> 00:19:25,849
and what the hell is that?

422
00:19:27,949 --> 00:19:30,183
Keep your hands off of him.

423
00:19:30,516 --> 00:19:32,183
That red hair.

424
00:19:32,216 --> 00:19:33,083
Did...

425
00:19:33,116 --> 00:19:36,183
Rias... come to save me.

426
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:39,216
I'll teach you not to meddle
where you don't belong.

427
00:19:45,383 --> 00:19:47,049
I'm done with you!

428
00:19:53,883 --> 00:19:55,983
That hair...

429
00:19:56,016 --> 00:19:58,316
You're from the
house of Gremory.

430
00:19:58,349 --> 00:20:00,216
My name's Rias Gremory...

431
00:20:00,249 --> 00:20:01,483
And who are you...

432
00:20:01,516 --> 00:20:04,183
...other than a fallen angel?

433
00:20:04,216 --> 00:20:05,816
Well, well, who knew...?

434
00:20:05,849 --> 00:20:07,516
This town is currently
under the control

435
00:20:07,549 --> 00:20:10,116
of the next head of
the great Gremory Family.

436
00:20:10,149 --> 00:20:12,383
So he's a part of your
household, I take it.

437
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:16,083
If you bring any harm to him,
you will get no mercy from me.

438
00:20:16,116 --> 00:20:18,416
I apologize for the
misunderstanding.

439
00:20:18,449 --> 00:20:21,416
Though it's unwise to let your
servants run loose like this...

440
00:20:21,449 --> 00:20:23,149
The next time he's
out for a stroll,

441
00:20:23,183 --> 00:20:26,116
he might run into someone
less cordial than myself.

442
00:20:26,149 --> 00:20:28,449
I appreciate the
friendly advice...

443
00:20:28,483 --> 00:20:30,483
Bear in mind, if anything
like this happens again...

444
00:20:30,516 --> 00:20:32,483
I'll make you regret
the day you crossed paths

445
00:20:32,516 --> 00:20:35,516
with the house of
Gremory, my friend.

446
00:20:36,116 --> 00:20:38,349
No offense to your noble
household, but you should

447
00:20:38,383 --> 00:20:41,783
bear in mind that the same
thing could be said to you.

448
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:44,016
My name is Dohnaseek.

449
00:20:44,049 --> 00:20:47,349
I pray that you and
I never again cross paths.

450
00:20:52,283 --> 00:20:53,583
That was a close call...

451
00:20:53,616 --> 00:20:56,849
I can't believe he actually
ran into a fallen one!

452
00:20:56,883 --> 00:20:59,083
If we don't do
something, he'll die.

453
00:20:59,116 --> 00:21:01,283
That won't happen.

454
00:21:01,916 --> 00:21:02,816
He'll live...

455
00:21:02,849 --> 00:21:04,516
I'll see to that myself.

456
00:21:09,687 --> 00:21:10,887
Master, wake up, won't you...

457
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:13,020
Master, wake up, won't you.

458
00:21:13,054 --> 00:21:15,687
Master, wake up,
won't you please.

459
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:19,220
So tired...

460
00:21:19,254 --> 00:21:21,120
That was the
weirdest dream yet...

461
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:24,287
Why does this keep
happening every night?

462
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,087
Hold on a sec, what happened
to all my clothes...?

463
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:29,620
Why the hell am I naked?

464
00:21:33,254 --> 00:21:34,020
No way...

465
00:21:34,054 --> 00:21:35,720
No way!

466
00:21:35,754 --> 00:21:37,920
This is awesome!

467
00:21:39,787 --> 00:21:41,554
Issei?

468
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,254
Hey.

469
00:21:47,354 --> 00:21:49,087
Whoa, I can see your tits!

470
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:51,420
Good morning.

471
00:21:51,454 --> 00:21:53,354
Uh, what are you
doing in my bed...?

472
00:21:53,387 --> 00:21:54,854
Is this really happening?

473
00:21:54,887 --> 00:21:56,620
Cause this feels like
it could be a porno,

474
00:21:56,654 --> 00:21:58,187
or some kind of a wet dream.

475
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:59,687
No, this is real.

476
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,320
And so is everything
else you've experienced,

477
00:22:01,354 --> 00:22:03,887
as a matter of fact.

478
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,020
My name is Rias Gremory...

479
00:22:06,054 --> 00:22:08,320
And I'm a devil.

480
00:22:08,354 --> 00:22:10,020
A devil?

481
00:22:10,054 --> 00:22:13,087
Not only that, but
I'm your Master, too...

482
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,354
You're mine now...

483
00:22:14,387 --> 00:22:17,154
Nice to meet you, Issei Hyodo.

484
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,187
Close your eyes and think
of the part of your body

485
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,620
you feel is strongest.

486
00:23:51,654 --> 00:23:52,887
Then focus on it.

487
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,187
I'm gonna have a harem!

488
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:56,220
They'll be naked all the time!

489
00:23:56,254 --> 00:23:57,920
I rule!

490
00:23:57,954 --> 00:23:58,754
But...

491
00:23:58,787 --> 00:24:00,254
I will say it kinda
feels as though

492
00:24:00,287 --> 00:24:02,120
I've adopted a little brother.
