1
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:18,400
Okey-dokie, I'm all set!

2
00:00:18,433 --> 00:00:20,766
Asia and I are gonna go
hand out some flyers...!

3
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,133
How bout it?
You ready to go?

4
00:00:22,166 --> 00:00:24,233
Hold on.

5
00:00:24,266 --> 00:00:27,533
I think you'll be glad to
know your flyer days are over.

6
00:00:27,566 --> 00:00:29,666
They are?

7
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:31,233
Relax, it's not a punishment.

8
00:00:31,266 --> 00:00:32,466
You've both done great work,

9
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,766
but normally the hassle
of running around,

10
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,366
handing out flyers is
the job of a familiar.

11
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,300
Hell yeah!

12
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:39,533
So what, is this sorta
like a promotion?

13
00:00:39,566 --> 00:00:41,700
Yeah, I guess you could
look at it that way,

14
00:00:41,733 --> 00:00:45,266
but first thing's first: we need
to find you two familiars.

15
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:25,769
This is my familiar, Issei...

16
00:02:25,802 --> 00:02:31,736
I believe you two
have met each other?

17
00:02:34,702 --> 00:02:37,436
Hot flyer girl's your familiar?

18
00:02:38,502 --> 00:02:41,169
And I've got one too, of course.

19
00:02:43,802 --> 00:02:45,236
Whoa, is that an imp?

20
00:02:45,269 --> 00:02:47,036
This is Shiro.

21
00:02:49,436 --> 00:02:50,502
Mine's badass.

22
00:02:50,536 --> 00:02:52,469
I don't care about
your tiny dancer.

23
00:02:52,502 --> 00:02:53,736
Why you gotta hate, man?

24
00:02:53,769 --> 00:02:56,102
Don't be jealous,
Issei, you'll get one...

25
00:02:56,136 --> 00:02:58,169
Familiars are a major
part of being a devil;

26
00:02:58,202 --> 00:03:00,236
when you're in need, they're
always there to back you up.

27
00:03:00,269 --> 00:03:01,502
That's great...

28
00:03:01,536 --> 00:03:04,136
only problem is, we have no idea
how we're supposed to get one.

29
00:03:04,169 --> 00:03:06,202
That's the next step.

30
00:03:06,236 --> 00:03:07,602
Yeah?

31
00:03:11,836 --> 00:03:13,269
Sorry to interrupt.

32
00:03:13,302 --> 00:03:16,069
Whoa, what the heck
is she doing here?!

33
00:03:16,102 --> 00:03:16,636
Issei...

34
00:03:16,669 --> 00:03:17,802
Who are these people?

35
00:03:17,836 --> 00:03:18,836
The one in the middle

36
00:03:18,869 --> 00:03:21,202
is Sona Shitori, the student
body president...

37
00:03:21,236 --> 00:03:22,436
And the girl with the glasses

38
00:03:22,469 --> 00:03:24,569
right behind her
is Tsubaki Shira.

39
00:03:24,602 --> 00:03:27,169
It looks like they brought the
rest of the council with them.

40
00:03:27,202 --> 00:03:28,836
Hello, Sona, what
can I do for you?

41
00:03:28,869 --> 00:03:30,636
Nothing, I just wanted
to congratulate you

42
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:32,669
on increasing the
number of your servants.

43
00:03:32,702 --> 00:03:34,336
Hold on, how does
she know about that?

44
00:03:34,369 --> 00:03:35,402
Her real name's Sona Sitri,

45
00:03:35,436 --> 00:03:37,669
and she's not just the
student council president,

46
00:03:37,702 --> 00:03:40,836
she's the next head of the House
of Sitri, a big devil family.

47
00:03:40,869 --> 00:03:43,602
Are you saying there are
other devils at our school?

48
00:03:43,636 --> 00:03:45,369
Rias, I'm hurt to
find out you didn't

49
00:03:45,402 --> 00:03:47,102
tell your little
boyfriend about us,

50
00:03:47,136 --> 00:03:49,302
but I suppose if you don't
trust him with inside info,

51
00:03:49,336 --> 00:03:51,502
then he must not be
worth much to you huh?

52
00:03:51,536 --> 00:03:52,736
It's considered bad form

53
00:03:52,769 --> 00:03:55,536
to get involved in the affairs
of other households, Saji...

54
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:57,769
It's only natural that
Rias held this back.

55
00:03:57,802 --> 00:03:58,336
I know you.

56
00:03:58,369 --> 00:03:59,436
You're the guy from 2-C

57
00:03:59,469 --> 00:04:01,736
who was just elected student
council clerk, right...?

58
00:04:01,769 --> 00:04:03,236
I think I mighta
voted for this guy.

59
00:04:03,269 --> 00:04:04,369
Saji Genshiro...

60
00:04:04,402 --> 00:04:05,502
My pawn.

61
00:04:05,536 --> 00:04:07,536
This is my pawn Issei Hyodo...

62
00:04:07,569 --> 00:04:09,569
And my bishop Asia Argento.

63
00:04:09,602 --> 00:04:11,336
Whoa, so you're
a pawn too, dude...?

64
00:04:11,369 --> 00:04:14,236
Then that totally
means we're twinsies!

65
00:04:14,269 --> 00:04:15,536
Can it d-bag...

66
00:04:15,569 --> 00:04:17,769
You and your gaggle of
slutty-sluts don't deserve

67
00:04:17,802 --> 00:04:19,069
to be in the same
room as a group

68
00:04:19,102 --> 00:04:21,369
of distinguished
devils like the Sitri's.

69
00:04:21,402 --> 00:04:22,802
You take that back!

70
00:04:22,836 --> 00:04:24,236
Aww... He's mad...

71
00:04:24,269 --> 00:04:25,736
Not even gay prince
charming over there

72
00:04:25,769 --> 00:04:27,102
could protect you from me,

73
00:04:27,136 --> 00:04:28,802
I took up four pawn pieces, bro.

74
00:04:28,836 --> 00:04:30,402
He took up eight pieces...

75
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:31,736
It's always better
to check your facts

76
00:04:31,769 --> 00:04:33,702
before you make a
complete fool of yourself.

77
00:04:33,736 --> 00:04:34,569
Wait... what...

78
00:04:34,602 --> 00:04:36,336
You're freaking
kidding me, right...?!

79
00:04:36,369 --> 00:04:38,636
How did this lame-ass,
butt-munch manage that?

80
00:04:38,669 --> 00:04:39,836
Shut up!

81
00:04:39,869 --> 00:04:41,136
My apologies...

82
00:04:41,169 --> 00:04:42,202
He's young...

83
00:04:42,236 --> 00:04:44,402
I hope you'll forgive him
his youthful naiveté...

84
00:04:44,436 --> 00:04:47,436
Newbies don't always appreciate
the finer points of civility...

85
00:04:47,469 --> 00:04:48,669
Do they?

86
00:04:48,702 --> 00:04:50,769
Oh... Right.

87
00:04:50,802 --> 00:04:52,502
My pleasure.

88
00:04:52,536 --> 00:04:54,702
No, the pleasure is all mine.

89
00:04:54,736 --> 00:04:55,402
Hey...

90
00:04:55,436 --> 00:04:56,569
You sure you're not an angel,

91
00:04:56,602 --> 00:04:58,636
cause I'm pretty sure you
just fell down from Heaven?

92
00:05:01,569 --> 00:05:03,102
Saji, I just want you
to know if you even think

93
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:04,336
of putting the moves on Asia,

94
00:05:04,369 --> 00:05:08,569
I'll slice off your nuts and
feed them to you through a tube!

95
00:05:08,602 --> 00:05:11,236
Oh, you think you've got that
shit on lock-down, well...!

96
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:13,536
You ain't the only bull in
this rodeo anymore, dick face!

97
00:05:13,569 --> 00:05:14,502
This is embarrassing.

98
00:05:14,536 --> 00:05:16,169
I know, isn't it?

99
00:05:16,202 --> 00:05:18,336
How's flyer duty treating
you, Captain Whack-it?

100
00:05:18,369 --> 00:05:19,536
I don't do lame shit like that,

101
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:21,269
cause I'm an actual
member of the team!

102
00:05:21,302 --> 00:05:22,802
Getting' a familiar
and everything, bitch.

103
00:05:22,836 --> 00:05:25,302
Guess what, tool?
I just got promoted from flyers

104
00:05:25,336 --> 00:05:27,402
and I'm getting a
familiar too, so suck it!

105
00:05:27,436 --> 00:05:27,969
Oh...!

106
00:05:28,002 --> 00:05:29,269
Is that your plan, Rias?

107
00:05:29,302 --> 00:05:30,236
Yes...

108
00:05:30,269 --> 00:05:32,502
I was thinking of going
next week, actually.

109
00:05:32,536 --> 00:05:34,169
Well, that's a bit of
a problem for us

110
00:05:34,202 --> 00:05:36,136
as he only takes
people once a month.

111
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,336
In that case, why don't we have

112
00:05:37,369 --> 00:05:39,569
a friendly little contest
to sort this whole thing out.

113
00:05:39,602 --> 00:05:40,769
A contest?

114
00:05:40,802 --> 00:05:43,602
Whoever wins earns the right
to make their request first.

115
00:05:43,636 --> 00:05:46,802
Surely you're not talking
about a Rating Game.

116
00:05:46,836 --> 00:05:47,936
Oh, no.

117
00:05:47,969 --> 00:05:49,836
We'd never get permission
to do something like that.

118
00:05:49,869 --> 00:05:51,136
Yes, you're right.

119
00:05:51,169 --> 00:05:52,302
Besides, this isn't the time

120
00:05:52,336 --> 00:05:55,202
to call attention to
yourself, now is it?

121
00:05:55,236 --> 00:05:56,769
Don't go there.

122
00:05:57,536 --> 00:05:58,336
I know!

123
00:05:58,369 --> 00:05:59,469
We should settle this

124
00:05:59,502 --> 00:06:02,369
the good ole' fashioned
high school way: with sports!

125
00:06:05,369 --> 00:06:06,236
Damn!

126
00:06:06,269 --> 00:06:07,102
Let's go, Rias...!

127
00:06:07,136 --> 00:06:09,536
Show these uptight
losers who's boss!

128
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:10,669
Come on, Sona...!

129
00:06:10,702 --> 00:06:12,836
Stick it to those jackwagons!

130
00:06:12,869 --> 00:06:13,702
Akeno...

131
00:06:13,736 --> 00:06:15,336
We're in it to win it.

132
00:06:15,369 --> 00:06:15,769
Got it.

133
00:06:15,802 --> 00:06:16,702
No mercy!

134
00:06:16,736 --> 00:06:17,636
Everyone ready...?

135
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:18,336
Good.

136
00:06:18,369 --> 00:06:20,669
Heh... May the best devil win.

137
00:06:28,669 --> 00:06:31,336
Oh man, tennis balls ain't the
only things bouncin' today...

138
00:06:31,369 --> 00:06:32,636
This game freakin' rules!

139
00:06:32,669 --> 00:06:34,802
I'd let her smack
my tennis balls.

140
00:06:37,102 --> 00:06:37,602
Why're you here?

141
00:06:37,636 --> 00:06:38,569
This is the bomb!

142
00:06:38,602 --> 00:06:40,769
I'm beefin' up my spank
bank material, dawg,

143
00:06:40,802 --> 00:06:42,702
I'll be whackin' it
for weeks offa this!

144
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:43,902
I wish I had a camera

145
00:06:43,936 --> 00:06:46,302
so I could preserve those
jiggily jugglies for posterity!

146
00:06:46,336 --> 00:06:47,569
They're so athletic,
can you imagine

147
00:06:47,602 --> 00:06:49,436
the moves they could
pull off in the sack?!

148
00:06:49,469 --> 00:06:52,236
I'd like to see them play a
little two on two on my junk!

149
00:06:52,269 --> 00:06:53,802
Camel toe!

150
00:06:55,569 --> 00:06:56,502
I don't think I've ever seen

151
00:06:56,536 --> 00:06:58,602
this many people at
a tennis match before.

152
00:07:00,402 --> 00:07:02,436
Give 'em hell, Sona!

153
00:07:02,802 --> 00:07:05,636
Whoa! Akeno, you are the tits!

154
00:07:05,669 --> 00:07:08,436
Is it just me or is this
getting a little out of control?

155
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:13,136
Let's see how you like a magic
attack, Sona Sitri-style?!

156
00:07:14,102 --> 00:07:15,169
Oh really...?

157
00:07:15,202 --> 00:07:20,069
Let's see how you handle
the Gremory counter strike!

158
00:07:20,102 --> 00:07:21,602
One point... to Sitri.

159
00:07:21,636 --> 00:07:23,536
Aww, man!

160
00:07:24,236 --> 00:07:26,302
Suck on that, Issei!

161
00:07:26,336 --> 00:07:28,069
Hey, we did agree to no magic...

162
00:07:28,102 --> 00:07:29,136
Didn't we?

163
00:07:29,169 --> 00:07:31,636
Yep, but that doesn't
seem to be stopping them.

164
00:07:31,669 --> 00:07:35,069
Did you see the curve on that!

165
00:07:35,736 --> 00:07:37,102
Well I guess we've pretty much

166
00:07:37,136 --> 00:07:38,536
kissed the rulebook
goodbye, huh?

167
00:07:38,569 --> 00:07:41,102
It's cool, Rias is about
to lay the smack down.

168
00:07:41,136 --> 00:07:42,102
Look, Sitri...

169
00:07:42,136 --> 00:07:43,102
You can cheat all you want to,

170
00:07:43,136 --> 00:07:44,369
but in the end it's not going

171
00:07:44,402 --> 00:07:46,302
to make a bit of
difference in this game...!

172
00:07:46,336 --> 00:07:47,769
You want a magic show...?

173
00:07:47,802 --> 00:07:49,536
Well, I've got a few tricks!

174
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:51,136
Do your worst Gremory...!

175
00:07:51,169 --> 00:07:52,602
You think I'm afraid of you?

176
00:07:52,636 --> 00:07:54,702
Bring it on!

177
00:07:56,302 --> 00:07:58,269
Too bad it was a draw.

178
00:07:58,302 --> 00:07:59,336
Since nobody won,

179
00:07:59,369 --> 00:08:01,536
they're suggesting we all
compete in a team match.

180
00:08:01,569 --> 00:08:02,402
Are you serious?

181
00:08:02,436 --> 00:08:03,669
Serious as a heart
attack, my friend,

182
00:08:03,702 --> 00:08:08,336
they're all out there right now,
deciding what we should play.

183
00:08:09,736 --> 00:08:12,602
We've chosen dodge ball
as the game to play.

184
00:08:12,636 --> 00:08:15,069
We meet the Sitri's
tomorrow night in the gym...

185
00:08:15,102 --> 00:08:17,369
So... Let's win this.

186
00:08:17,402 --> 00:08:18,736
Right!

187
00:08:18,769 --> 00:08:20,536
Thanks for playing for us, guys.

188
00:08:20,569 --> 00:08:22,369
Yeah, for real.

189
00:08:32,869 --> 00:08:35,802
Hey, Asia, are you still awake?

190
00:08:37,302 --> 00:08:38,069
Issei...

191
00:08:38,102 --> 00:08:40,469
Hi. Come on in.

192
00:08:40,502 --> 00:08:44,136
Oh... I can't...
It's really late!

193
00:08:44,169 --> 00:08:45,136
I'm... sorry to bother you,

194
00:08:45,169 --> 00:08:47,602
but do you have a needle
and thread I can borrow?

195
00:08:47,636 --> 00:08:49,269
Yeah...?

196
00:08:51,569 --> 00:08:53,236
They outnumber us by two people

197
00:08:53,269 --> 00:08:55,269
so we've asked the
extras to be referees.

198
00:08:55,302 --> 00:08:56,502
I'm like the worst at sports;

199
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,836
I don't even know if
I remember how to play.

200
00:08:58,869 --> 00:09:00,702
Oh... You'll be fine,
just grab a ball,

201
00:09:00,736 --> 00:09:04,102
aim it at the Sitri team,
and hit 'em right in the face!

202
00:09:04,136 --> 00:09:05,169
Asia picked it up in no time;

203
00:09:05,202 --> 00:09:07,036
I'm sure you can do it too!

204
00:09:07,269 --> 00:09:09,069
My legs are on fire!

205
00:09:09,102 --> 00:09:11,669
Stretch it a little bit farther;
come on, you can do it.

206
00:09:11,702 --> 00:09:13,469
I'll... Try...

207
00:09:17,436 --> 00:09:20,402
I've had wet dreams that
started exactly like this!

208
00:09:20,436 --> 00:09:22,602
Only there were
way less clothes.

209
00:09:22,636 --> 00:09:26,136
Join us, Issei.

210
00:09:31,302 --> 00:09:32,269
Team headbands?

211
00:09:32,302 --> 00:09:33,169
Nice.

212
00:09:33,202 --> 00:09:34,802
Yeah, we're gonna
look totally badass.

213
00:09:34,836 --> 00:09:36,636
Thanks, I stayed up all night
making em.

214
00:09:36,669 --> 00:09:37,469
You didn't sleep?

215
00:09:37,502 --> 00:09:39,069
I just wanted to
make something cool

216
00:09:39,102 --> 00:09:40,002
as a way of saying thank you

217
00:09:40,036 --> 00:09:42,102
for everything you
guys are doing for us...

218
00:09:42,136 --> 00:09:44,236
I'm lucky to have friends
as awesome as you...

219
00:09:44,269 --> 00:09:45,502
Plus, I suck at sports,

220
00:09:45,536 --> 00:09:49,269
so this way I'll remember not to
throw the ball at my own team.

221
00:09:49,302 --> 00:09:49,836
What's wrong...?

222
00:09:49,869 --> 00:09:50,836
Are they lame?

223
00:09:50,869 --> 00:09:52,536
Maybe I should've gone
with t-shirts instead.

224
00:09:52,569 --> 00:09:54,769
Oh, no, I think
they're perfect, Issei...

225
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:56,802
It was nice of you to do that.

226
00:09:56,836 --> 00:09:59,136
I don't know, it's not
a big deal or anything.

227
00:09:59,169 --> 00:10:00,836
You're a pervert,
but you're sweet.

228
00:10:00,869 --> 00:10:02,302
Let's put these on,
go out there,

229
00:10:02,336 --> 00:10:04,636
and do our best to
kick some Sitri butt!

230
00:10:04,669 --> 00:10:05,436
Yeah!

231
00:10:05,469 --> 00:10:07,602
Ready to rock and roll?!

232
00:10:29,832 --> 00:10:31,065
That's a point!

233
00:10:31,865 --> 00:10:32,865
Aw, right in the tit.

234
00:10:32,898 --> 00:10:35,665
I need a drink anyway.

235
00:10:36,198 --> 00:10:39,965
Ready or not here I come!

236
00:10:41,765 --> 00:10:44,865
Well, catching Tsubaki's spike
head-on is pretty impressive.

237
00:10:44,898 --> 00:10:46,398
Don't forget Sona,
I'm a Gremory,

238
00:10:46,432 --> 00:10:48,032
that's just how we roll!

239
00:10:57,765 --> 00:11:00,232
Behind you!

240
00:11:00,265 --> 00:11:01,298
Got it!

241
00:11:01,332 --> 00:11:03,198
You need to keep your
head in the game, sweetie!

242
00:11:03,232 --> 00:11:03,732
Whoa...

243
00:11:03,765 --> 00:11:05,398
I just saw your bra!

244
00:11:13,232 --> 00:11:15,065
Let's see how you handle this!

245
00:11:15,798 --> 00:11:18,232
I had no idea that dodge ball
was so terrifying!

246
00:11:18,265 --> 00:11:21,098
This isn't dodge ball anymore,
it's like a fight to the death!

247
00:11:21,132 --> 00:11:23,998
Want me to go ahead and
take out that sissy ass pawn?!

248
00:11:24,032 --> 00:11:25,032
No, I got it!

249
00:11:25,065 --> 00:11:27,298
Here comes the pain!

250
00:11:28,132 --> 00:11:29,832
Shit!

251
00:11:29,865 --> 00:11:30,998
Oh, whoa! What the
hell's up with this thing?

252
00:11:31,032 --> 00:11:32,332
Issei! Look out!

253
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:41,398
My... Frank and Beans...

254
00:11:41,432 --> 00:11:43,798
I think they're squished.

255
00:11:44,232 --> 00:11:46,298
I can use my twilight
healing to make you better,

256
00:11:46,332 --> 00:11:49,298
but first you have to show
me where it hurts, Issei.

257
00:11:49,332 --> 00:11:50,098
Oh, no...

258
00:11:50,132 --> 00:11:51,365
I'm fine, thanks!

259
00:11:51,398 --> 00:11:54,398
You're in pain, I think it'd be
best if I took a quick look--

260
00:11:54,432 --> 00:11:55,532
Uh, I don't want you using

261
00:11:55,565 --> 00:11:58,065
your weird other worldly
twilight thingie on my junk...

262
00:11:58,098 --> 00:12:00,432
My twig and
berries are off limits!

263
00:12:00,465 --> 00:12:01,765
If it'll make you
more comfortable...

264
00:12:01,798 --> 00:12:04,765
I can just do it over the pants.

265
00:12:08,165 --> 00:12:09,432
Tell me, how does that feel?

266
00:12:09,465 --> 00:12:10,865
Tingly.

267
00:12:10,898 --> 00:12:12,832
You better not be
getting a chub right now.

268
00:12:12,865 --> 00:12:14,032
It's got a mind of its own.

269
00:12:14,065 --> 00:12:16,765
Take good care of him, Asia,
we've got a game to finish!

270
00:12:16,798 --> 00:12:18,165
Will do.

271
00:12:18,198 --> 00:12:20,998
Come on, you guys,
let's win this one for Issei!

272
00:12:21,032 --> 00:12:21,498
Yeah...!

273
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:22,932
For his man-bits!

274
00:12:22,965 --> 00:12:24,032
For his one-eyed snake!

275
00:12:24,065 --> 00:12:25,832
For his sack.

276
00:12:25,865 --> 00:12:26,432
Does that feel good...?

277
00:12:26,465 --> 00:12:27,298
Oh, boy...

278
00:12:27,332 --> 00:12:29,965
Thank you for the
support everybody.

279
00:12:32,032 --> 00:12:37,832
Bring it!

280
00:12:37,865 --> 00:12:39,265
Come on, let's
end this thing, Sitri.

281
00:12:39,298 --> 00:12:40,765
Right here, right now!

282
00:12:40,798 --> 00:12:43,032
Oh, I'm just getting
warmed up, Rias!

283
00:12:43,065 --> 00:12:45,032
Game over!

284
00:12:45,998 --> 00:12:46,532
All right...!

285
00:12:46,565 --> 00:12:48,098
We did it...! We won!

286
00:12:48,132 --> 00:12:49,265
A deal's a deal, Sona...

287
00:12:49,298 --> 00:12:52,232
Since we beat you, we get
first pick of the familiars.

288
00:12:52,265 --> 00:12:54,065
As much as I hate to
lose, I have to admit:

289
00:12:54,098 --> 00:12:56,132
that was still a
whole lotta fun.

290
00:12:56,165 --> 00:12:58,065
Although, if this had
been a Rating Game,

291
00:12:58,098 --> 00:12:59,665
and not just us fooling around,

292
00:12:59,698 --> 00:13:01,065
there's no way you
could've beat me.

293
00:13:01,098 --> 00:13:02,165
You really think so...?

294
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:03,165
Well, I guess we won't know

295
00:13:03,198 --> 00:13:05,432
for sure until we
actually play the Game...

296
00:13:05,465 --> 00:13:08,898
But it'll be a while 'til we
have to worry about that.

297
00:13:08,932 --> 00:13:11,998
Don't be so sure, Rias, you
never know what's coming up.

298
00:13:13,465 --> 00:13:13,998
Huh...?

299
00:13:14,032 --> 00:13:16,432
What's a Rating Game?

300
00:13:16,465 --> 00:13:18,098
Victory!

301
00:13:18,132 --> 00:13:19,765
I want you to know,
I'm thankful to each

302
00:13:19,798 --> 00:13:21,232
and every one of
you for going out there

303
00:13:21,265 --> 00:13:23,832
and doing what needed to be
done to beat those devils...

304
00:13:23,865 --> 00:13:25,765
I hope you guys feel very proud.

305
00:13:25,798 --> 00:13:28,065
Hell, all I did was get
knocked in the love spuds.

306
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:29,665
Sure, you got
nailed in the nads,

307
00:13:29,698 --> 00:13:31,332
but you also made
these headbands...

308
00:13:31,365 --> 00:13:32,765
They're pretty rad, man.

309
00:13:32,798 --> 00:13:33,732
Totes.

310
00:13:33,765 --> 00:13:34,632
Yeah...!

311
00:13:34,665 --> 00:13:36,065
They really brought
our team together!

312
00:13:37,998 --> 00:13:38,798
Thanks, bro...

313
00:13:38,832 --> 00:13:39,965
I don't wanna sound
gay or anything,

314
00:13:39,998 --> 00:13:40,898
but if you were a hot chick,

315
00:13:40,932 --> 00:13:42,765
I'd totally make out
with you right now!

316
00:13:42,798 --> 00:13:44,032
Okay...?

317
00:13:44,065 --> 00:13:45,798
I hate to break up
the celebration,

318
00:13:45,832 --> 00:13:48,765
but I think it's time we go get
these two a couple of familiars.

319
00:13:49,732 --> 00:13:51,898
Wait, you mean we're
getting them right now?

320
00:13:51,932 --> 00:13:54,298
Full moon tonight, this
is our best shot to see him.

321
00:13:54,332 --> 00:13:56,132
See who?

322
00:13:56,165 --> 00:13:58,765
The Familiar Master.

323
00:14:01,765 --> 00:14:02,865
Uh, where are we?

324
00:14:02,898 --> 00:14:05,198
Duh, a magical forest
where all the familiars live.

325
00:14:05,232 --> 00:14:06,065
Don't be scared;

326
00:14:06,098 --> 00:14:08,198
this is where we
came to get ours too.

327
00:14:09,298 --> 00:14:10,332
Oh, I'm cool...

328
00:14:10,365 --> 00:14:12,265
I mean, besides the fact
that I just pissed myself.

329
00:14:12,298 --> 00:14:14,098
Yeah... It's really freaky.

330
00:14:14,132 --> 00:14:16,265
Who wants me?!

331
00:14:16,298 --> 00:14:18,165
Hey! Who's there?!

332
00:14:18,198 --> 00:14:21,432
The master of the
familiar, aka 'The Towji!'

333
00:14:21,465 --> 00:14:22,432
That's the guy?

334
00:14:22,465 --> 00:14:23,398
Oh, wow.

335
00:14:23,432 --> 00:14:25,165
If you're goal is to
find familiars galore,

336
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:27,698
you've come at the
right time, that's for sure!

337
00:14:27,732 --> 00:14:29,432
The full moon is out
to help you decide,

338
00:14:29,465 --> 00:14:31,965
and I'll be the one
to act as your guide.

339
00:14:31,998 --> 00:14:33,032
If you can't tell,

340
00:14:33,065 --> 00:14:35,265
The Towji's way obsessed
with making things rhyme.

341
00:14:35,298 --> 00:14:36,165
Uh-huh.

342
00:14:36,198 --> 00:14:37,665
Now, how can I help you?

343
00:14:37,698 --> 00:14:39,665
Tell me all your
wants and desires...

344
00:14:39,698 --> 00:14:40,598
A strong one?

345
00:14:40,632 --> 00:14:42,898
A fast one, one that
likes to set fires?

346
00:14:42,932 --> 00:14:43,998
Yeah... Cool...

347
00:14:44,032 --> 00:14:46,265
Do you have any hot
familiars with big tig-o's...?

348
00:14:46,298 --> 00:14:47,865
Who really like
nerdy white guys?!

349
00:14:48,465 --> 00:14:51,165
This is why amateurs
always annoy...

350
00:14:51,198 --> 00:14:53,032
If you're seeking
something more than a toy,

351
00:14:53,065 --> 00:14:54,965
utilize your other head, my boy.

352
00:14:54,998 --> 00:14:57,032
To find the familiar
who will be the best fit,

353
00:14:57,065 --> 00:15:00,065
look for best personality,
don't look for best tit.

354
00:15:00,098 --> 00:15:01,265
Makes sense,

355
00:15:01,298 --> 00:15:03,698
but I'd like one that's really
cute and fun to be around.

356
00:15:03,732 --> 00:15:04,232
Fun...?

357
00:15:04,265 --> 00:15:05,165
Done and done!

358
00:15:05,198 --> 00:15:06,865
Oh! Thank you so much!

359
00:15:06,898 --> 00:15:08,665
Hey, no fair, dude!

360
00:15:10,832 --> 00:15:12,765
This lake is awesome,
righteous and right,

361
00:15:12,798 --> 00:15:15,232
at the bottom, you'll
find magical sprites.

362
00:15:15,265 --> 00:15:15,765
Yeah...!

363
00:15:15,798 --> 00:15:17,332
Sprites are sexy...!

364
00:15:17,365 --> 00:15:19,432
We just hit the
familiar jackpot!

365
00:15:19,465 --> 00:15:21,232
She'll emerge from the
water wearing nothing

366
00:15:21,265 --> 00:15:22,898
but a soaking wet
see-through dress

367
00:15:22,932 --> 00:15:24,432
with hair long
enough to tie me up.

368
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:26,065
Then she'll pull me below

369
00:15:26,098 --> 00:15:30,232
and we'll make sweet,
sweet, soggy love.

370
00:15:30,265 --> 00:15:32,732
Whoa! Check out the lake!

371
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:33,965
Here we go...

372
00:15:33,998 --> 00:15:36,732
Looks like a sprite
is about to show.

373
00:15:48,765 --> 00:15:49,265
Take a look.

374
00:15:49,298 --> 00:15:50,265
That's off the hook!

375
00:15:50,298 --> 00:15:51,998
But clearly not off the 'roids!

376
00:15:52,032 --> 00:15:53,865
What is it, a
competitive body builder?!

377
00:15:53,898 --> 00:15:57,165
Undine are rare water sprites
with mega watt power...

378
00:15:57,198 --> 00:15:59,732
A familiar like that would
make your enemies cower.

379
00:15:59,765 --> 00:16:00,865
Screw that...!

380
00:16:00,898 --> 00:16:02,865
He looks like he could pick me
up and break me in half!

381
00:16:02,898 --> 00:16:03,765
Not he...

382
00:16:03,798 --> 00:16:05,398
Sorry, but this he's a she.

383
00:16:05,432 --> 00:16:06,232
A she...?

384
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:08,332
I think I just threw
up in my mouth.

385
00:16:09,332 --> 00:16:11,998
That sprite back there,
she had really kind eyes...

386
00:16:12,032 --> 00:16:13,932
Even though she's
tough on the outside,

387
00:16:13,965 --> 00:16:15,365
I could tell she
has a good heart.

388
00:16:15,398 --> 00:16:16,065
Oh yeah...

389
00:16:16,098 --> 00:16:18,398
And pecs the size of my head.

390
00:16:19,198 --> 00:16:22,798
Oh my... Look, high!

391
00:16:26,265 --> 00:16:27,698
Okay. What is that?

392
00:16:27,732 --> 00:16:29,198
Aw...! It's really cute!

393
00:16:29,232 --> 00:16:30,765
Cute but dangerous, too...

394
00:16:30,798 --> 00:16:31,898
When they get angry,

395
00:16:31,932 --> 00:16:33,832
they have the power to
shoot a lightning that's blue.

396
00:16:33,865 --> 00:16:36,032
Hey, that type of dragon
is pretty rare, isn't it?

397
00:16:36,065 --> 00:16:38,232
I think this is the first
time I've ever seen one.

398
00:16:38,265 --> 00:16:40,232
Do it now, if you
want this one claimed...

399
00:16:40,265 --> 00:16:41,765
Once these dragons grow up,

400
00:16:41,798 --> 00:16:42,998
they can no longer be tamed.

401
00:16:43,032 --> 00:16:45,798
Issei, since you possess the
power of the Red Dragon Emperor,

402
00:16:45,832 --> 00:16:47,865
that sprite might turn out
to be a pretty good fit.

403
00:16:47,898 --> 00:16:49,065
Yeah, that makes sense...

404
00:16:49,098 --> 00:16:54,198
Right...! Dragon...!
I choose y--!

405
00:16:54,232 --> 00:16:55,665
Asia!

406
00:17:01,165 --> 00:17:02,698
Oh my!

407
00:17:04,932 --> 00:17:07,032
Its green slime!

408
00:17:07,065 --> 00:17:08,998
It's burning my clothes!

409
00:17:09,032 --> 00:17:10,898
How naughty!

410
00:17:10,932 --> 00:17:15,665
I'm so slimy and wet!

411
00:17:17,032 --> 00:17:18,732
No!

412
00:17:24,698 --> 00:17:25,432
Oh...

413
00:17:25,465 --> 00:17:27,165
My skirt!

414
00:17:31,165 --> 00:17:33,098
It's so grody...

415
00:17:33,132 --> 00:17:34,965
Vomit town.

416
00:17:35,065 --> 00:17:37,332
Damn!

417
00:17:37,365 --> 00:17:38,332
Dude...

418
00:17:38,365 --> 00:17:40,332
This is the best thing
that has ever happened!

419
00:17:41,332 --> 00:17:42,865
Suck on that, perv-pants.

420
00:17:42,898 --> 00:17:43,932
It's not my fault

421
00:17:43,965 --> 00:17:47,098
you guys got slimed outta
your skivvies by goo!

422
00:17:52,132 --> 00:17:55,298
My hands are tied, I can't
use my magic like this!

423
00:17:55,332 --> 00:17:57,998
Me neither, how are we
gonna get out of this mess?

424
00:17:58,032 --> 00:17:59,232
I'll save you... but...

425
00:17:59,265 --> 00:18:02,698
First I have to save this image
to the spank bank for later.

426
00:18:02,732 --> 00:18:05,698
Eating off clothes is the random
power of this weird slime...

427
00:18:05,732 --> 00:18:06,765
Fun for a while,

428
00:18:06,798 --> 00:18:08,832
but in the end, a complete
and utter waste of time.

429
00:18:08,865 --> 00:18:09,765
Hey...!

430
00:18:09,798 --> 00:18:10,998
That's really the
only thing it does...?!

431
00:18:11,032 --> 00:18:11,998
I found mine...!

432
00:18:12,032 --> 00:18:14,698
I want the slime to be
my familiar right now!

433
00:18:14,732 --> 00:18:15,832
The pain hurts so good,

434
00:18:15,865 --> 00:18:17,932
I might just have
to fight you for it!

435
00:18:17,965 --> 00:18:19,365
Yes!

436
00:18:19,398 --> 00:18:21,065
Every hot girl
I meet will instantly

437
00:18:21,098 --> 00:18:22,798
be naked with this by my side!

438
00:18:22,832 --> 00:18:24,098
No, Issei you can't!

439
00:18:24,132 --> 00:18:25,698
Picking a familiar is one of

440
00:18:25,732 --> 00:18:27,432
the most important
decisions you'll ever make...

441
00:18:27,465 --> 00:18:30,198
Please! You have to
think it through first!

442
00:18:33,165 --> 00:18:34,065
I've thought about it enough!

443
00:18:34,098 --> 00:18:36,232
This is the one I want for sure!

444
00:18:41,932 --> 00:18:42,965
Sorry, slime...

445
00:18:42,998 --> 00:18:44,798
We coulda had some fun!

446
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:54,498
Just back away, Issei...

447
00:18:54,532 --> 00:18:57,698
The only thing to do with a
monster like that is burn it.

448
00:18:57,732 --> 00:18:58,632
No, don't!

449
00:18:58,665 --> 00:18:59,832
I won't have to
undress every single girl

450
00:18:59,865 --> 00:19:03,398
I meet with my eyes anymore
if I have slimey by my side!

451
00:19:03,432 --> 00:19:05,198
Meeting this thing
was my destiny...!

452
00:19:05,232 --> 00:19:07,098
Don't take that
away from me, please!

453
00:19:07,132 --> 00:19:09,232
I can't believe Issei's
actually hugging me!

454
00:19:09,265 --> 00:19:10,398
It's perfect!

455
00:19:10,432 --> 00:19:11,765
Oh, yucky slime...!

456
00:19:11,798 --> 00:19:13,798
We were meant to be!

457
00:19:13,832 --> 00:19:15,265
Seriously too into this stuff.

458
00:19:15,298 --> 00:19:17,098
I've never seen a
devil come to the forest

459
00:19:17,132 --> 00:19:19,165
for one of its biggest pests...

460
00:19:19,198 --> 00:19:20,732
I don't think this one
knows there's more

461
00:19:20,765 --> 00:19:21,765
to life than breasts!

462
00:19:21,798 --> 00:19:23,398
He's usually such a good boy...

463
00:19:23,432 --> 00:19:24,398
But I guess in the end,

464
00:19:24,432 --> 00:19:26,898
the pervert inside of
him finally took over.

465
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:27,432
Come on...!

466
00:19:27,465 --> 00:19:28,532
You really blame me

467
00:19:28,565 --> 00:19:30,232
for wanting something
that makes chicks naked...?

468
00:19:30,265 --> 00:19:31,698
How am I supposed

469
00:19:31,732 --> 00:19:33,932
to turn down pure
unadulterated jubbly action?

470
00:19:37,365 --> 00:19:39,032
That sucked.

471
00:19:39,065 --> 00:19:41,432
Aw, the sprite dragon
used his blue lightning.

472
00:19:41,465 --> 00:19:43,298
Yucky slime, no...!

473
00:19:43,332 --> 00:19:44,798
This is your fault!

474
00:19:47,832 --> 00:19:49,332
Are you all right?!

475
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:53,098
That was dope.

476
00:19:53,132 --> 00:19:54,932
Sprite dragons
don't attack unless

477
00:19:54,965 --> 00:19:56,965
they believe their loved
ones are in trouble...

478
00:19:56,998 --> 00:19:59,132
Which, in the familiar
world means that dragon

479
00:19:59,165 --> 00:20:01,798
and lovely lady should
be together on the double!

480
00:20:01,832 --> 00:20:03,965
You mean Asia and that
thing are bonded now?

481
00:20:03,998 --> 00:20:05,365
He's so cute!

482
00:20:08,098 --> 00:20:10,065
Well, isn't that sweet.

483
00:20:10,098 --> 00:20:12,898
Now, I gotta take a shit,
so you guys need to beat feet.

484
00:20:12,932 --> 00:20:16,298
In the name of Asia Argento
and devils everywhere.

485
00:20:16,332 --> 00:20:20,298
I command you to accept this
pact to be my familiar forever.

486
00:20:23,865 --> 00:20:25,332
Well... Looks to me
like you got a friend...!

487
00:20:25,365 --> 00:20:28,198
I think you two will
be very happy together!

488
00:20:30,365 --> 00:20:31,998
Hey! That tickles...

489
00:20:32,032 --> 00:20:32,332
Rassei...

490
00:20:32,365 --> 00:20:33,132
Stop it.

491
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:34,165
Rassei?

492
00:20:34,198 --> 00:20:36,365
For some reason that
name popped in my head...

493
00:20:36,398 --> 00:20:37,365
I love him!

494
00:20:37,398 --> 00:20:39,698
And every time I hold him,
I'll think of you.

495
00:20:39,732 --> 00:20:41,665
That's a really sweet
thing to say, Asia...

496
00:20:41,698 --> 00:20:44,298
I'm glad to meet
you Mister Rassei.

497
00:20:48,432 --> 00:20:50,665
Oh, something you should
know about these creatures.

498
00:20:50,698 --> 00:20:53,098
They hate other males--that's
just one of their features.

499
00:20:53,132 --> 00:20:55,198
What a naughty boy Rassei is.

500
00:20:56,132 --> 00:20:57,198
Oh, yucky slime...!

501
00:20:57,232 --> 00:20:59,398
Why did you have to leave me?!

502
00:20:59,432 --> 00:21:03,298
I wanted your gazonga exposing
powers to be mine forever!

503
00:21:03,332 --> 00:21:05,632
Quit your whining, lech balls.

504
00:21:10,461 --> 00:21:12,327
They say sprite dragons
only give themselves

505
00:21:12,361 --> 00:21:14,794
to the most worthy and
pure-hearted of masters...

506
00:21:14,827 --> 00:21:17,894
And normally, they would
never choose to serve a devil.

507
00:21:17,927 --> 00:21:19,661
Asia used to be a holy sister,

508
00:21:19,694 --> 00:21:21,527
so who knows, maybe
that had some sway

509
00:21:21,561 --> 00:21:24,294
over the little guy?

510
00:21:26,561 --> 00:21:27,461
Hey! Bad Dragon!

511
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:30,761
That chest isn't yours
to nuzzle in, bud!

512
00:21:32,927 --> 00:21:36,294
Now, Rassei, you have to be
nice to Uncle Issei, okay?

513
00:21:37,727 --> 00:21:38,794
All right then, sweet boy,

514
00:21:38,827 --> 00:21:41,361
it's time to say goodnight.

515
00:21:44,427 --> 00:21:45,627
I know I should
be happy for her,

516
00:21:45,661 --> 00:21:47,294
but now that Asia
has a leg up on me...

517
00:21:47,327 --> 00:21:49,294
I guess I'm kinda jealous!

518
00:21:49,327 --> 00:21:50,261
You know what, though,

519
00:21:50,294 --> 00:21:52,027
soon I'll get a kick
ass familiar of my own,

520
00:21:52,061 --> 00:21:54,761
and I'll be right back
on top again, bitches!

521
00:21:55,394 --> 00:21:56,594
I can't wait, man...

522
00:21:56,627 --> 00:21:57,261
Well...

523
00:21:57,294 --> 00:21:58,594
See you tomorrow, everyone.

524
00:21:58,627 --> 00:21:59,527
Good night guys!

525
00:21:59,561 --> 00:22:00,661
Night.

526
00:22:03,494 --> 00:22:04,961
Issei's got a long way to go.

527
00:22:04,994 --> 00:22:06,427
He's a newbie, give him time.

528
00:22:06,461 --> 00:22:07,561
You're right.

529
00:22:12,461 --> 00:22:14,427
That he is.

530
00:23:48,494 --> 00:23:49,427
She gonna strip, too...?

531
00:23:49,461 --> 00:23:51,594
Oh please turn around,
please turn around.

532
00:23:51,627 --> 00:23:52,894
You like seeing people naked,

533
00:23:52,927 --> 00:23:54,927
and I could be
one of those people.

534
00:23:55,661 --> 00:23:58,394
He's fiancé to the next
head of the House of Gremory.

535
00:23:58,427 --> 00:24:00,427
I need you to
take my virginity...

536
00:24:00,461 --> 00:24:01,961
And I need you to do it now.
