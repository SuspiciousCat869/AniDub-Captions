1
00:00:21,733 --> 00:00:23,733
Last time when I almost died...

2
00:00:23,766 --> 00:00:26,733
This must be what
she did to bring me back.

3
00:00:26,766 --> 00:00:27,666
All set.

4
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:30,233
Thanks a lot.

5
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,733
You need to relax, at least till
you get your full strength back.

6
00:00:36,766 --> 00:00:39,733
The light power that stray
exorcist used on you was strong,

7
00:00:39,766 --> 00:00:41,433
you're lucky we
showed up when we did.

8
00:00:41,466 --> 00:00:43,033
A stray exorcist?

9
00:00:43,066 --> 00:00:45,333
I'm not even sure I know
what that term means.

10
00:00:45,366 --> 00:00:47,233
A ton of them got the
boot from the Church,

11
00:00:47,266 --> 00:00:48,366
and for lack of options,

12
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,400
many became servants
of fallen angels.

13
00:00:50,433 --> 00:00:51,300
Wait...!

14
00:00:51,333 --> 00:00:52,800
You can't actually
be saying Asia's in

15
00:00:52,833 --> 00:00:55,733
the same camp
as that Freed dick?

16
00:00:55,766 --> 00:00:58,366
We're not saying anything,
other than you're a devil.

17
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:01,800
And for whatever reason, she's
the servant of a fallen one.

18
00:01:01,833 --> 00:01:03,500
Those are the facts, Issei.

19
00:01:03,533 --> 00:01:06,133
But...

20
00:01:07,133 --> 00:01:08,733
Asia.

21
00:01:08,766 --> 00:01:11,233
I'm nothing but a big loser...

22
00:01:11,266 --> 00:01:13,100
A stupid pawn...

23
00:01:13,133 --> 00:01:14,600
I can't save my friend...

24
00:01:14,633 --> 00:01:16,433
Can't protect myself.

25
00:01:16,466 --> 00:01:18,366
Trust me, Issei.

26
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,700
No, to hell with all that!

27
00:01:19,733 --> 00:01:21,333
I'm weak right now...!

28
00:01:21,366 --> 00:01:24,766
But I won't be after I pump
some iron and get jacked!

29
00:01:33,833 --> 00:01:35,133
That blew.

30
00:01:35,166 --> 00:01:37,400
I'm a sissy boy.

31
00:01:39,066 --> 00:01:40,100
No...

32
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:41,800
I'm not gonna bitch out
and throw in the towel...

33
00:01:41,833 --> 00:01:44,366
I've gotta save Asia
from that angel douche!

34
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:48,633
Issei, it's you.

35
00:01:52,233 --> 00:01:54,000
Asia?

36
00:03:29,294 --> 00:03:29,960
Trust me...

37
00:03:29,994 --> 00:03:31,260
There's no other way.

38
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:32,927
There isn't?

39
00:03:34,527 --> 00:03:37,294
This is how you're
supposed to eat a hamburger.

40
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,794
Well if that's the way
you're supposed to do it...

41
00:03:42,827 --> 00:03:44,527
Here goes!

42
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,360
Oh my.

43
00:03:54,394 --> 00:03:56,194
It's so yummy!

44
00:03:57,894 --> 00:04:00,560
Hey, Asia, what made you
decide to go to the park?

45
00:04:00,594 --> 00:04:03,794
Oh well...

46
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:05,060
The weather was perfect,

47
00:04:05,094 --> 00:04:08,794
and I thought it might be nice
to get out and enjoy the day.

48
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:10,294
But then...

49
00:04:10,327 --> 00:04:12,727
I saw you there and my
fun day got even better...

50
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,527
So yay.

51
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,594
You know what?

52
00:04:14,627 --> 00:04:15,160
Huh uh.

53
00:04:15,194 --> 00:04:15,860
Since you're free...!

54
00:04:15,894 --> 00:04:17,960
Why don't we hang out together?

55
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:22,327
Yeah, sure!

56
00:04:35,827 --> 00:04:36,727
You all right?

57
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:39,760
Oh... Yeah, I'm
totally fine, no big deal.

58
00:04:40,994 --> 00:04:42,760
So, you dig stuffed animals.

59
00:04:42,794 --> 00:04:43,460
Oh...!

60
00:04:43,494 --> 00:04:46,327
Not at all... Well, sort of...

61
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,594
Yes.

62
00:04:47,627 --> 00:04:49,527
I'm kinda outing myself
as a big nerd here,

63
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,794
but I've spent hundreds
of hours in arcades...

64
00:04:51,827 --> 00:04:52,927
Yeah!

65
00:04:54,527 --> 00:04:56,527
Thanks for winning
this little guy for me...!

66
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,827
From now on,
every time I look at it,

67
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:59,394
I'll remember how
much of a blessing

68
00:04:59,427 --> 00:05:01,860
it's been to get to know you.

69
00:05:01,894 --> 00:05:04,894
Come on, there's plenty
of stuff left to see.

70
00:05:04,927 --> 00:05:05,960
Thank you...

71
00:05:05,994 --> 00:05:07,594
This is special...

72
00:05:07,627 --> 00:05:10,494
Even if it is only for today.

73
00:05:11,027 --> 00:05:12,127
You know what?

74
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,560
I can't remember the last
time I had this much fun!

75
00:05:14,594 --> 00:05:17,594
Yeah? Good, I'm glad;
I had a pretty great time, too.

76
00:05:18,894 --> 00:05:19,694
Oww, that hurt!

77
00:05:19,727 --> 00:05:21,627
It's your wound
from the other day.

78
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:22,494
Yeah...

79
00:05:22,527 --> 00:05:24,194
It stings.

80
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,960
Man, she sure is pretty.

81
00:05:36,827 --> 00:05:37,994
Does your leg hurt too?

82
00:05:38,027 --> 00:05:38,827
Oh.

83
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:40,494
Yeah.

84
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:47,427
Is that good?

85
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:48,227
Uh...

86
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,394
Yeah...

87
00:05:49,427 --> 00:05:51,727
That already feels like a
thousand times better.Wow...

88
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,327
And check out these
bad ass moves I got now!

89
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:54,994
Awesome...

90
00:05:55,027 --> 00:05:56,927
Thank you so much, Asia.

91
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,760
When I was a baby,

92
00:06:01,794 --> 00:06:05,260
I was abandoned
by my real parents.

93
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,994
They left me in
front of a church

94
00:06:07,027 --> 00:06:08,727
in a small town in Europe...

95
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,660
I was told when they found
me I wouldn't stop crying...

96
00:06:11,694 --> 00:06:14,394
The sweet nuns
there brought me up.

97
00:06:14,427 --> 00:06:15,994
One day, when
I was about eight...

98
00:06:16,027 --> 00:06:17,994
A sad little puppy
who was hurt real bad,

99
00:06:18,027 --> 00:06:20,560
found its way into the
church where I lived...

100
00:06:20,594 --> 00:06:23,760
I prayed as hard as I could
that God would spare him...

101
00:06:23,794 --> 00:06:24,860
And when I did...

102
00:06:24,894 --> 00:06:26,960
A miracle happened.

103
00:06:26,994 --> 00:06:28,527
Because of my power...

104
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,860
I was immediately taken
to a larger church...

105
00:06:30,894 --> 00:06:32,694
Men and women
from all over the world

106
00:06:32,727 --> 00:06:34,427
would visit when they
were injured or sick

107
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,760
and I was told to
heal all of them...

108
00:06:36,794 --> 00:06:38,394
The idea that
I possessed this thing

109
00:06:38,427 --> 00:06:41,594
that could actually help
other people made me so happy.

110
00:06:41,627 --> 00:06:43,827
I finally felt
like I had purpose.

111
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,060
But then one day...

112
00:06:45,094 --> 00:06:48,827
I came across someone who had
fallen and was in bad shape.

113
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:52,694
I was able to heal him,
but he wasn't a man.

114
00:06:52,727 --> 00:06:54,960
This girl has the
power to heal devils!

115
00:06:54,994 --> 00:06:55,860
Demon!

116
00:06:55,894 --> 00:06:56,794
She's a witch!

117
00:06:56,827 --> 00:06:58,927
Burn her!

118
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,960
They said anyone who had
my kind of power was a heretic,

119
00:07:01,994 --> 00:07:04,260
so I had no choice
but to run away.

120
00:07:04,294 --> 00:07:04,994
That's awful...

121
00:07:05,027 --> 00:07:05,994
So after you took off,

122
00:07:06,027 --> 00:07:08,560
is that when you decided
to join the fallen ones?

123
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:09,627
Yes...

124
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,660
But I'll never
forget who I am...

125
00:07:11,694 --> 00:07:14,727
I say my prayers and try
my best to live a good life.

126
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,560
They're awful...

127
00:07:15,594 --> 00:07:17,727
They do such
horrible, evil things

128
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,794
and all in the name of God.

129
00:07:22,727 --> 00:07:25,894
This suffering has to
be a test of my faith.

130
00:07:27,294 --> 00:07:29,360
But If I can
overcome these trials...

131
00:07:29,394 --> 00:07:30,660
Someday, I know...

132
00:07:30,694 --> 00:07:33,394
My hopes and dreams
will come true...

133
00:07:33,427 --> 00:07:35,560
That's what I believe anyway.

134
00:07:35,594 --> 00:07:36,794
What are your dreams?

135
00:07:36,827 --> 00:07:39,627
To make lots of
life-long friends...

136
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:42,394
To get to know them well,
and do cool things...

137
00:07:42,427 --> 00:07:44,260
To be able to
have fun together...

138
00:07:44,294 --> 00:07:46,327
And care for each other.

139
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,760
It's kinda silly.

140
00:07:48,794 --> 00:07:49,827
Honestly...

141
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:52,694
I'd be happy to
have any friends.

142
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,560
Hey, is something wrong?

143
00:08:00,594 --> 00:08:03,760
I don't care what other
people say; I'm your friend.

144
00:08:03,794 --> 00:08:05,227
I mean, after what
we've been through,

145
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:07,360
how could we not be?

146
00:08:08,027 --> 00:08:08,894
It's true...!

147
00:08:08,927 --> 00:08:10,427
I'd say we've gotten
to know each other

148
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:12,460
pretty well, wouldn't you...?

149
00:08:12,494 --> 00:08:15,627
And... I won you that stuffed
animal so that happened.

150
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:19,660
And I definitely care about you.

151
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,227
We can't...

152
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:25,294
I care about you,
too, but we can't...

153
00:08:25,327 --> 00:08:26,527
Issei... No...

154
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,527
It's forbidden, and I don't
want to cause you any trouble!

155
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:32,227
I'm sick and tired of people
telling me what I can't do...

156
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:34,660
We're friends and
that's the way it is!

157
00:08:34,694 --> 00:08:36,494
Really?

158
00:08:36,527 --> 00:08:38,227
Alright.

159
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:41,194
Thank you, Issei.

160
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,760
Isn't that sweet?

161
00:08:44,794 --> 00:08:45,460
Crap...

162
00:08:45,494 --> 00:08:46,794
It's Yuma.

163
00:08:46,827 --> 00:08:49,394
Lady Raynare.

164
00:08:50,994 --> 00:08:51,760
Right.

165
00:08:51,794 --> 00:08:53,527
She's a fallen angel.

166
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,694
So the rumors about
your downward spiral

167
00:08:55,727 --> 00:08:58,294
into the wickedness
of devildom are true...

168
00:08:58,327 --> 00:09:00,527
And I had such high hopes.

169
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,827
Don't even try to run, Asia.

170
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:03,860
Be gone...

171
00:09:03,894 --> 00:09:05,360
I want no part of the evil you

172
00:09:05,394 --> 00:09:07,360
and the other
angels are up to...!

173
00:09:07,394 --> 00:09:08,560
I ran away...

174
00:09:08,594 --> 00:09:10,760
I'm sorry, but I couldn't stand
to be around them anymore!

175
00:09:10,794 --> 00:09:12,727
Don't apologize; I'm glad!

176
00:09:13,694 --> 00:09:14,927
You're too good for them...

177
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,060
You don't belong
around that bunch of

178
00:09:16,094 --> 00:09:19,794
good-for-nothing-has-been-
wanna-be bastards anyway!

179
00:09:19,827 --> 00:09:21,727
Whaddaya want from me, Yuma?!

180
00:09:22,727 --> 00:09:24,394
Oh, don't worry,
my business here

181
00:09:24,427 --> 00:09:26,627
has nothing to do
with you, little boy,

182
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:30,460
though, I guess we could finish
what we started, couldn't we?

183
00:09:30,494 --> 00:09:33,260
Let's... have... fun.

184
00:09:34,427 --> 00:09:35,727
A spear of light...

185
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,194
Oh shit.

186
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,727
I always hate to see
someone die a virgin.

187
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:43,860
Sacred Gear!

188
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,527
It worked!

189
00:09:49,694 --> 00:09:51,560
Is that really
all you've got...?!

190
00:09:51,594 --> 00:09:53,394
It's nothing but
a 'twice critical'...

191
00:09:53,427 --> 00:09:55,294
Coming up short, as usual!

192
00:09:55,327 --> 00:09:56,794
Wait. A twice what?!

193
00:09:56,827 --> 00:09:58,960
It's also called
a 'dragon's hand'...

194
00:09:58,994 --> 00:10:01,594
That thing only doubles
your power temporarily.

195
00:10:01,627 --> 00:10:04,460
You might as well be fighting
me with sticks and stones.

196
00:10:04,494 --> 00:10:05,760
Man, that's all it does?

197
00:10:05,794 --> 00:10:09,427
Word upstairs is you're
a devil to watch out for.

198
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:12,294
They said your Sacred Gear was
a force to be reckoned with,

199
00:10:12,327 --> 00:10:14,594
that's why I put on
that dumb little girl act.

200
00:10:14,627 --> 00:10:17,527
'Please, Issei...
Be my boyfriend'...

201
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,960
Ridiculous...

202
00:10:18,994 --> 00:10:20,360
You sure bought it though.

203
00:10:20,394 --> 00:10:23,394
Hook, line, and sinker!

204
00:10:23,427 --> 00:10:25,427
Shut your face... and fight!

205
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:27,260
You're an idiot if you
think you can take me on

206
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:28,860
with that tiny thing!

207
00:10:28,894 --> 00:10:31,927
Give me the girl, take what's
left of your dignity, and go.

208
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:32,827
Not happening!

209
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,460
Please be careful!

210
00:10:34,494 --> 00:10:37,694
If I can't take care of my
friends, then what good am I?!

211
00:10:37,727 --> 00:10:38,727
Double my power...!

212
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,494
Come on now, show me
what you're made of Gear!

213
00:10:41,527 --> 00:10:42,927
Boost!

214
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,760
It's working!.

215
00:10:43,794 --> 00:10:47,227
I feel the power!

216
00:10:48,894 --> 00:10:50,394
Issei, no!

217
00:10:50,427 --> 00:10:51,794
You're hurt!

218
00:10:51,827 --> 00:10:52,860
Nice catch.

219
00:10:52,894 --> 00:10:55,660
Looks like your equipment
can't get the job done.

220
00:10:55,694 --> 00:10:58,660
If I were you
I'd get used to that.

221
00:10:58,694 --> 00:11:00,560
Damn.

222
00:11:00,594 --> 00:11:02,827
What are you doing?

223
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,427
I'm healing you, silly.

224
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:04,860
Wow...

225
00:11:04,894 --> 00:11:06,527
That's handy.

226
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,727
This is awesome...

227
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,827
The pain's almost
gone away completely.

228
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,960
Now, Asia, be a good little
girl and come with me...

229
00:11:17,994 --> 00:11:20,894
Your healing power is far
more rare and infinitely

230
00:11:20,927 --> 00:11:25,360
more valuable to our kind than
his Sacred Gear ever could be.

231
00:11:25,394 --> 00:11:26,427
I knew it...

232
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:29,760
You're only interested in
me because of my power!

233
00:11:29,794 --> 00:11:32,227
How about you and
I make a deal...?

234
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:35,927
If you agree to come with me
then I won't murder your friend.

235
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,627
Screw you, lady...!

236
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:39,527
No way she's going with you!

237
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,460
Look out!

238
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:50,660
Issei, no!

239
00:11:50,694 --> 00:11:51,494
That sucked.

240
00:11:51,527 --> 00:11:54,327
I've never seen
a spear that strong.

241
00:11:55,594 --> 00:11:57,594
I spared his life on purpose.

242
00:11:57,627 --> 00:12:00,527
If I had wanted to, I could've
delivered a fatal blow...

243
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,227
Your friend would've shattered
into a million pieces.

244
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,794
I'll go with you.

245
00:12:12,527 --> 00:12:13,494
Good girl...

246
00:12:13,527 --> 00:12:15,694
No need to fret--after
the big ritual tonight,

247
00:12:15,727 --> 00:12:18,927
all your worries and troubles
will be gone forever...

248
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,527
I'll see you soon, Issei.

249
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,494
No, stop!

250
00:12:21,527 --> 00:12:22,494
Asia!

251
00:12:22,527 --> 00:12:23,827
Goodbye, friend.

252
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:25,927
I'll miss you.

253
00:12:31,494 --> 00:12:33,360
No.

254
00:12:33,394 --> 00:12:35,394
Why couldn't I save her?

255
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:53,424
Let me try one more time:
if I say 'don't,' you don't!

256
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:55,324
You have to forget
about, Asia...

257
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:58,124
You are a member of
the Gremory Family now!

258
00:12:58,158 --> 00:12:58,958
Fine...

259
00:12:58,991 --> 00:13:00,358
Then maybe it's
time you released me

260
00:13:00,391 --> 00:13:01,991
from your household...

261
00:13:02,024 --> 00:13:03,924
Cause I refuse to
just let her go!

262
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:05,791
I'm sorry, but I can't do that.

263
00:13:05,824 --> 00:13:07,791
Of course not,
I'm your precious pawn...

264
00:13:07,824 --> 00:13:10,324
Can't do without your most
important piece, can you?!

265
00:13:10,358 --> 00:13:13,024
That's enough, Issei!

266
00:13:13,991 --> 00:13:15,424
Pawns are important...

267
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:18,924
They're not the weakest piece
in the game by any means.

268
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:23,291
Do you remember when
I told you my 'evil pieces'

269
00:13:23,324 --> 00:13:26,824
have the same attributes
as their chess characters?

270
00:13:26,858 --> 00:13:30,524
Yeah, but so what,
what can a stupid pawn do?

271
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:35,824
In this chess game...

272
00:13:35,858 --> 00:13:37,058
Quite a bit...

273
00:13:37,091 --> 00:13:39,324
If a pawn advances deep enough
into the enemy's territory,

274
00:13:39,358 --> 00:13:43,258
it can be promoted to any
other piece besides the King.

275
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:44,524
So does that mean
eventually I can have

276
00:13:44,558 --> 00:13:46,558
all the same powers
as everyone else?

277
00:13:46,591 --> 00:13:48,491
Yes, but only if
the master declares

278
00:13:48,524 --> 00:13:50,191
the place enemy territory...

279
00:13:50,224 --> 00:13:53,558
Say, for example,
the fallen one's church.

280
00:13:53,591 --> 00:13:56,824
Now let's talk about
your Sacred Gear.

281
00:13:56,858 --> 00:13:58,991
Oh yeah, it doubles my
power, is that right...?!

282
00:13:59,024 --> 00:14:00,858
Yuma said, uh...

283
00:14:00,891 --> 00:14:03,491
I mean the fallen angel told me.

284
00:14:03,524 --> 00:14:05,324
Just feel.

285
00:14:07,858 --> 00:14:09,824
Any Sacred Gear works
in direct correlation

286
00:14:09,858 --> 00:14:11,891
to the current
feelings of its owner...

287
00:14:11,924 --> 00:14:14,224
Or, to put it another way,
the stronger those feelings are,

288
00:14:14,258 --> 00:14:16,891
the more powerful
your Sacred Gear will be.

289
00:14:16,924 --> 00:14:18,058
I didn't know...

290
00:14:18,091 --> 00:14:19,824
That's cool.

291
00:14:25,891 --> 00:14:26,824
Something has come up...

292
00:14:26,858 --> 00:14:29,458
Akeno and I have to
step out for a moment.

293
00:14:29,491 --> 00:14:31,258
Wait a minute, I have
more questions for you!

294
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:33,524
Remember, even
if you're promoted...

295
00:14:33,558 --> 00:14:35,291
no matter their rank,

296
00:14:35,324 --> 00:14:37,524
a single devil cannot
stand up to a fallen one.

297
00:14:40,391 --> 00:14:42,858
I guess we'll have to
see about that, won't we?

298
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:44,458
You going?

299
00:14:44,491 --> 00:14:45,358
Yep...

300
00:14:45,391 --> 00:14:47,324
And there's no point
trying to stop me.

301
00:14:47,358 --> 00:14:49,024
You're gonna get killed.

302
00:14:49,058 --> 00:14:49,891
Well I can deal with that,

303
00:14:49,924 --> 00:14:52,091
as long as I can
get her out of there.

304
00:14:52,124 --> 00:14:53,358
That's very brave...

305
00:14:53,391 --> 00:14:54,958
Very stupid, too...

306
00:14:54,991 --> 00:14:56,124
This is suicide.

307
00:14:56,158 --> 00:14:57,424
It's none of your business!

308
00:14:58,324 --> 00:14:59,491
I'm coming with you.

309
00:14:59,524 --> 00:15:00,791
Wait, what?

310
00:15:00,824 --> 00:15:01,891
Weren't you listening...?

311
00:15:01,924 --> 00:15:03,791
The President basically
said you get in that church

312
00:15:03,824 --> 00:15:05,791
and you're promoted.

313
00:15:05,824 --> 00:15:08,791
But she also said you wouldn't
be able to do it on your own.

314
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:10,191
Yeah...

315
00:15:10,224 --> 00:15:11,858
So we're gonna back you up,

316
00:15:11,891 --> 00:15:13,524
and there's no way in hell
we're gonna let you go in there

317
00:15:13,558 --> 00:15:15,991
without us so you might as
well save your breath, dude.

318
00:15:16,024 --> 00:15:16,958
Koneko too?

319
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:19,191
There's nothing else goin' on.

320
00:15:20,891 --> 00:15:22,291
Ugh, this is the worst!

321
00:15:22,324 --> 00:15:25,191
Standing guard is the
most boring thing ever!

322
00:15:27,124 --> 00:15:27,891
Oooooh...

323
00:15:27,924 --> 00:15:30,258
Ask and ye shall
freakin' receive.

324
00:15:30,291 --> 00:15:31,491
Hi, there...

325
00:15:31,524 --> 00:15:33,458
I'm Mittelt, and I'm totally
the most awesome fallen angel

326
00:15:33,491 --> 00:15:35,191
in the history of ever!

327
00:15:35,224 --> 00:15:37,524
This little girl's really
into herself, isn't she?

328
00:15:37,558 --> 00:15:39,524
My servant sensed
that you were nearby...

329
00:15:39,558 --> 00:15:40,958
Since you're out
here standing guard,

330
00:15:40,991 --> 00:15:43,158
your people must be
worried about an attack.

331
00:15:43,191 --> 00:15:44,424
Worried...?

332
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:47,191
No, we're just in the middle of
a super-duper-top-secret ritual

333
00:15:47,224 --> 00:15:48,958
and we don't want
you devils interfering.

334
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:50,291
Not to burst your bubble...

335
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:52,324
But unfortunately, a couple
of the younger members

336
00:15:52,358 --> 00:15:54,324
of our team are on
their way there right now.

337
00:15:54,358 --> 00:15:55,258
They're what...?!

338
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:57,191
Are you flippin' kidding me?

339
00:15:57,224 --> 00:15:58,058
Nope...

340
00:15:58,091 --> 00:15:59,891
And they're not
being discreet about it.

341
00:15:59,924 --> 00:16:01,458
Ooooh! I hate devils...!

342
00:16:01,491 --> 00:16:04,391
I just wanna squish their
ugly, stupid, devil faces...!

343
00:16:04,424 --> 00:16:05,791
Ugh, whatever!

344
00:16:05,824 --> 00:16:07,224
Let them do their worst...

345
00:16:07,258 --> 00:16:08,224
Not like they can stop us.

346
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:10,891
There are way more of us
than there are of them!

347
00:16:10,924 --> 00:16:12,224
So why are you here...?

348
00:16:12,258 --> 00:16:14,558
I hope it's not for some
sort of rescue operation,

349
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:16,958
cause if so, you'll have
to deal with me first...

350
00:16:16,991 --> 00:16:19,058
I may be little, but
I promise you this much:

351
00:16:19,091 --> 00:16:21,158
I can pack a mean punch!

352
00:16:21,191 --> 00:16:22,491
They're on their own.

353
00:16:23,391 --> 00:16:26,091
We won't be making
any attempt to rescue them.

354
00:16:26,124 --> 00:16:26,991
So what?

355
00:16:27,024 --> 00:16:29,291
You're just gonna
sit back and watch?

356
00:16:30,124 --> 00:16:31,291
Oh, man, can you feel that?

357
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:34,224
No kidding, there must be
a ton of priests inside there.

358
00:16:34,258 --> 00:16:35,024
Seriously...

359
00:16:35,058 --> 00:16:36,858
I think I'm glad
you guys are here.

360
00:16:36,891 --> 00:16:39,158
Well, hey, you and
I are buddies, right?

361
00:16:39,191 --> 00:16:40,424
Besides...

362
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:43,458
Fallen angels aren't exactly my
favorite things in the world...

363
00:16:43,491 --> 00:16:45,824
The truth is, I hate them.

364
00:16:45,858 --> 00:16:47,391
Oh yeah?

365
00:16:48,324 --> 00:16:49,024
Hold on...!

366
00:16:49,058 --> 00:16:50,358
Don't just go in!

367
00:16:50,391 --> 00:16:53,424
No need to be sneaky;
they know we're here.

368
00:17:01,924 --> 00:17:03,458
This place is creepy.

369
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:07,291
So we meet again!

370
00:17:07,324 --> 00:17:08,824
Glad you could make it...

371
00:17:08,858 --> 00:17:10,791
I bet I'm a sight
for sore eyes, huh?

372
00:17:10,824 --> 00:17:12,058
Yeah, right!

373
00:17:12,091 --> 00:17:14,058
Here's the thing,
I pride myself on the fact

374
00:17:14,091 --> 00:17:17,024
that I never have to battle
any devil more than once...

375
00:17:17,058 --> 00:17:18,124
And yet here you are...

376
00:17:18,158 --> 00:17:19,424
Just rubbing it in...!

377
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:21,258
If there's one thing
I won't abide,

378
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:24,091
its being mocked by maggot
devils in the house of God...

379
00:17:24,124 --> 00:17:25,358
So, whaddaya say...?

380
00:17:25,391 --> 00:17:27,524
Let's finish this!

381
00:17:27,558 --> 00:17:29,291
The thought of
tearing away your flesh

382
00:17:29,324 --> 00:17:33,458
and eating it piece by piece
makes my mouth water!

383
00:17:33,491 --> 00:17:34,991
Tell me where she is!

384
00:17:35,024 --> 00:17:36,091
Oh right...

385
00:17:36,124 --> 00:17:38,791
You mean that dirty devil-loving
whore of a Sister...

386
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:40,424
All you have to do is
go down to the basement;

387
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:43,458
she's right beneath the altar
we're currently standing on.

388
00:17:43,491 --> 00:17:44,458
Downstairs.

389
00:17:44,491 --> 00:17:45,324
Right...

390
00:17:45,358 --> 00:17:47,191
But first you have
to go through me.

391
00:17:47,224 --> 00:17:49,424
Sacred Gear!

392
00:17:50,558 --> 00:17:53,324
Here.

393
00:17:53,358 --> 00:17:55,491
You're pretty strong
for a runt, aren't you?!

394
00:17:55,524 --> 00:17:57,258
Suck it.

395
00:18:03,424 --> 00:18:04,458
Come on...!

396
00:18:04,491 --> 00:18:05,558
That all you've got...?!

397
00:18:05,591 --> 00:18:08,324
Show me something interesting!

398
00:18:08,358 --> 00:18:09,124
You're quick.

399
00:18:09,158 --> 00:18:10,291
Well you're not
so bad yourself...

400
00:18:10,324 --> 00:18:13,991
Of course that only makes
me wanna kill you even more.

401
00:18:16,558 --> 00:18:18,924
Whoa! Kiba's like
a total bad ass, huh?

402
00:18:18,958 --> 00:18:19,924
Alright...

403
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:22,358
If you wanna get serious
about this, I can too.

404
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:30,424
Hey, what the hell is this?!

405
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:31,824
The 'Holy Eraser'...

406
00:18:31,858 --> 00:18:34,258
It's a sword of darkness
that devours light.

407
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:34,958
Please!

408
00:18:34,991 --> 00:18:36,391
You think I'm afraid of you?!

409
00:18:36,424 --> 00:18:38,258
I didn't know he
had a Sacred Gear!

410
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:39,358
Issei!

411
00:18:40,858 --> 00:18:41,224
Boost!

412
00:18:41,258 --> 00:18:41,858
All right...

413
00:18:41,891 --> 00:18:43,458
No more of this bullshit!

414
00:18:44,224 --> 00:18:46,291
Rescue or not,
I can't let you go.

415
00:18:46,324 --> 00:18:48,524
You're like, totally the
captain of your loser squad,

416
00:18:48,558 --> 00:18:51,391
and if we take you out they're
on a trip to useless town.

417
00:18:51,424 --> 00:18:52,324
Sorry...

418
00:18:52,358 --> 00:18:55,258
But I'm bringing
friends to this tea party!

419
00:18:57,558 --> 00:18:59,058
Good work, Mittelt.

420
00:18:59,091 --> 00:19:01,558
Sad to say we meet
again, Lady Gremory.

421
00:19:01,591 --> 00:19:03,924
You should've kept
your servant in line.

422
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:06,791
He stuck his nose where
it doesn't belong again.

423
00:19:06,824 --> 00:19:09,058
Well, well, the gang's all here.

424
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:12,958
Time for a promotion!

425
00:19:14,024 --> 00:19:15,058
The rook is a tank...

426
00:19:15,091 --> 00:19:17,958
Its power is an unparalleled
defensive strength.

427
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:19,424
Yeah, I'm fucked.

428
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:24,458
Did I mention it kicks
some serious ass?!

429
00:19:31,358 --> 00:19:31,991
That's for Asia...

430
00:19:32,024 --> 00:19:33,791
For what you did to her...!

431
00:19:33,824 --> 00:19:36,191
Hey, that felt
pretty good actually!

432
00:19:36,224 --> 00:19:37,958
You bastard!

433
00:19:39,858 --> 00:19:41,991
Ouchie!

434
00:19:42,024 --> 00:19:43,424
I'll be damned if
a bunch of devils

435
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:45,291
are gonna get the best
of Freed Sellzen...!

436
00:19:45,324 --> 00:19:46,391
You won the battle...

437
00:19:46,424 --> 00:19:47,891
But not the war, scum!

438
00:19:47,924 --> 00:19:49,458
Ha!

439
00:19:50,158 --> 00:19:51,258
Damn, he got away.

440
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:53,324
Forget him, let's keep moving!

441
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:54,858
Guys!

442
00:19:56,424 --> 00:19:58,891
It seems very clear to us
that your intention here

443
00:19:58,924 --> 00:20:00,358
is to obstruct our ritual.

444
00:20:00,391 --> 00:20:01,791
And that we can't allow.

445
00:20:01,824 --> 00:20:03,791
You'll pay for
it with your lives!

446
00:20:03,824 --> 00:20:04,358
Akeno.

447
00:20:04,391 --> 00:20:05,824
Already on it.

448
00:20:25,824 --> 00:20:26,891
No fair...!

449
00:20:26,924 --> 00:20:29,191
I wasn't told we could
wear costumes to this fight!

450
00:20:35,124 --> 00:20:36,791
It's a barrier!

451
00:20:36,824 --> 00:20:37,424
Uh-oh...

452
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:39,791
We're totes screwed!

453
00:20:40,524 --> 00:20:44,458
Catching my prey in
a cage gets me so hot!

454
00:20:44,491 --> 00:20:46,058
This was your
plan the whole time!

455
00:20:46,091 --> 00:20:47,258
Yep...

456
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:49,058
And I'm gonna take
a whole lot of pleasure

457
00:20:49,091 --> 00:20:50,991
out of watching
you three in pain...

458
00:20:51,024 --> 00:20:52,358
Hope you're into S and M.

459
00:20:52,391 --> 00:20:54,158
That's totally gross!

460
00:20:54,191 --> 00:20:56,058
End of the line for you.

461
00:20:56,858 --> 00:20:58,958
Go ahead and act as
confident as you want.

462
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:01,124
The ritual's almost done...

463
00:21:01,158 --> 00:21:02,291
And once it's over...

464
00:21:02,324 --> 00:21:03,824
Not even you will have the power

465
00:21:03,858 --> 00:21:06,424
to stand against
us, Lady Gremory.

466
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:07,924
Come on in, devils.

467
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:09,358
Welcome to the party...

468
00:21:09,391 --> 00:21:11,391
Though I'm afraid
you're too late.

469
00:21:14,324 --> 00:21:16,791
Asia!

470
00:21:18,458 --> 00:21:19,858
Issei...

471
00:21:19,891 --> 00:21:20,924
You came.

472
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:21,491
I'm here...

473
00:21:21,524 --> 00:21:22,224
Hold on!

474
00:21:22,258 --> 00:21:23,424
No, wait!

475
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:24,458
Asia!

476
00:21:26,058 --> 00:21:28,458
This really is an incredibly
touching reunion...

477
00:21:28,491 --> 00:21:31,224
Unfortunately,
the ritual's over.

478
00:21:32,491 --> 00:21:33,524
What are you doing to her...?

479
00:21:33,558 --> 00:21:35,191
You let Asia go right now!

480
00:21:35,224 --> 00:21:35,891
That's it...

481
00:21:35,924 --> 00:21:38,491
They're after her Sacred Gear.

482
00:21:40,558 --> 00:21:41,491
I see now.

483
00:21:41,524 --> 00:21:43,858
You're out to steal the
Sister's Sacred Gear

484
00:21:43,891 --> 00:21:45,991
and use it for your
own evil purposes.

485
00:21:46,024 --> 00:21:48,024
Hold on a second,
I don't understand...

486
00:21:48,058 --> 00:21:50,224
What's going to happen to her?!

487
00:21:50,258 --> 00:21:51,158
I'm sorry.

488
00:21:51,191 --> 00:21:54,758
Taking that from her
is taking her life.

489
00:22:02,991 --> 00:22:03,924
Wait.

490
00:22:03,958 --> 00:22:05,424
She's dying?

491
00:22:07,058 --> 00:22:08,491
Twilight healing...

492
00:22:08,524 --> 00:22:11,458
At last it's in my hands.

493
00:23:49,185 --> 00:23:51,885
You deserve a reward
for making it this far.

494
00:23:51,918 --> 00:23:53,718
You won't get away, bitch!

495
00:23:53,751 --> 00:23:56,285
If I were you I wouldn't
underestimate him.

496
00:23:56,318 --> 00:23:57,251
Let's just say...

497
00:23:57,285 --> 00:23:59,718
He's the most powerful
pawn I've ever seen.
