1
00:00:18,733 --> 00:00:21,566
Only one more hour before
the Rating game starts.

2
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,266
The House of Phoenix
has no respect for us...

3
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,266
Let's give 'em a taste

4
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:28,266
of how strong the
House of Gremory truly is.

5
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:31,133
They will receive
no mercy from us!

6
00:00:31,166 --> 00:00:33,700
I've been training for this
like my life depended on it...

7
00:00:33,733 --> 00:00:35,700
There's no way in
hell I'll let them win!

8
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:38,766
Issei, are you there?

9
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,100
Do you mind if I come in?

10
00:00:40,133 --> 00:00:42,433
No, please do.

11
00:00:42,466 --> 00:00:43,266
Wow.

12
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:44,133
Uh...

13
00:00:44,166 --> 00:00:46,133
Haven't seen you
wear that in a while.

14
00:00:46,166 --> 00:00:49,633
I thought my habit might make
me feel more confident...

15
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:51,200
Rias said she was okay with it,

16
00:00:51,233 --> 00:00:53,066
as long as I felt comfortable...

17
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,166
So I just wanted to
know what you thought.

18
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,066
I think you look pretty
incredible, actually;

19
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,666
but then I've always
liked you in that outfit.

20
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:00,700
You're sweet...

21
00:01:00,733 --> 00:01:02,366
I'd like to stay
here with you...

22
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,400
Do you mind?

23
00:01:03,433 --> 00:01:04,100
No...

24
00:01:04,133 --> 00:01:06,400
Not at all.

25
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:15,933
What's wrong?

26
00:01:15,966 --> 00:01:20,366
Oh, nothing, I'm just a little
bit nervous about the battle.

27
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,733
Still, as long I have
you here next to me...

28
00:01:22,766 --> 00:01:24,366
I know everything'll be fine.

29
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,200
Yeah.

30
00:01:25,233 --> 00:01:27,166
Is it all right
with you, Issei...?

31
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,466
If I just stay here
like this for a while?

32
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:30,033
You kidding...?

33
00:01:30,066 --> 00:01:31,766
I think it's perfect.

34
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,300
Rise and shine and
go kick some ass!

35
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,000
Let's go... It's time.

36
00:03:23,448 --> 00:03:25,315
Unbelievable!

37
00:03:25,348 --> 00:03:26,382
Our fearless leader doesn't

38
00:03:26,415 --> 00:03:28,948
even look worried about
the game today, does she?

39
00:03:30,115 --> 00:03:31,615
Sorry if I'm interrupting.

40
00:03:31,648 --> 00:03:33,448
No, please, come on in, Sona.

41
00:03:33,482 --> 00:03:34,815
I'm glad you could make it.

42
00:03:34,848 --> 00:03:38,015
Wow, I sure didn't expect
to see those two here...

43
00:03:38,048 --> 00:03:40,082
What gives?

44
00:03:40,115 --> 00:03:41,915
There's a live broadcast
of the competition

45
00:03:41,948 --> 00:03:43,782
so family members can watch...

46
00:03:43,815 --> 00:03:46,315
Sona and Tsubaki are here
to help out with that.

47
00:03:46,348 --> 00:03:47,782
Awesome.

48
00:03:47,815 --> 00:03:50,582
And besides, it's her
first Rating Game...

49
00:03:50,615 --> 00:03:52,782
I wouldn't miss an event
like this for anything.

50
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:54,782
Well, I promise to do
everything in my power

51
00:03:54,815 --> 00:03:56,782
to make it interesting for you.

52
00:04:03,382 --> 00:04:04,248
It's almost time...

53
00:04:04,282 --> 00:04:06,048
I hope you're ready
for this, my lady.

54
00:04:06,082 --> 00:04:07,015
Yes...

55
00:04:07,048 --> 00:04:08,648
We're ready whenever you are.

56
00:04:08,682 --> 00:04:10,848
In a few moments,
we'll use this magic circle

57
00:04:10,882 --> 00:04:14,482
to transport you and the rest of
your team to the battlefield.

58
00:04:14,515 --> 00:04:16,448
And where exactly
is the battlefield?

59
00:04:16,482 --> 00:04:19,348
In a neutral alternate space,
created just for the game...

60
00:04:19,382 --> 00:04:21,015
Because it's not real,
we have full license

61
00:04:21,048 --> 00:04:24,615
to do some damage, even burn
it to the ground if we want.

62
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:27,382
Great, that doesn't
sound scary at all.

63
00:04:27,415 --> 00:04:29,582
I'll be in the Student
Council broadcast

64
00:04:29,615 --> 00:04:30,848
booth calling the game...

65
00:04:30,882 --> 00:04:32,515
We'll be cheering you on...

66
00:04:32,548 --> 00:04:33,748
Good luck.

67
00:04:33,782 --> 00:04:34,648
Thanks a lot...

68
00:04:34,682 --> 00:04:36,782
Just try to keep the
play-by-play fair.

69
00:04:36,815 --> 00:04:38,482
Oh, I'll keep it clean.

70
00:04:38,515 --> 00:04:40,782
Though if I was
a betting girl...

71
00:04:40,815 --> 00:04:41,748
I'd say you're going

72
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:44,548
to beat that scumbag
seven ways from Sunday.

73
00:04:47,015 --> 00:04:48,815
There's something
I forgot to tell you.

74
00:04:48,848 --> 00:04:50,915
I thought you'd like to
know the Great Devil Lucifer,

75
00:04:50,948 --> 00:04:54,015
will be watching the Game.

76
00:04:54,582 --> 00:04:56,848
Oh... brother dearest.

77
00:04:56,882 --> 00:04:58,282
Whoa...

78
00:04:58,315 --> 00:05:00,082
Are you telling me that your
older brother is <i>The</i> Devil...?

79
00:05:00,115 --> 00:05:02,015
Or am I just hearing
things wrong?

80
00:05:02,048 --> 00:05:05,582
No, Rias's brother is Lucifer,
the King of the Devils.

81
00:05:05,615 --> 00:05:06,982
<i>The</i> Lucifer...?

82
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:10,382
The King of the entire
underworld is your big bro?!

83
00:05:10,415 --> 00:05:11,548
That's right.

84
00:05:11,582 --> 00:05:13,015
His name is Sir Zechs...

85
00:05:13,048 --> 00:05:15,848
Although historically he has
been known by many names...

86
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:17,982
During the great war,
our leader died...

87
00:05:18,015 --> 00:05:19,548
Sir Zechs took over the throne

88
00:05:19,582 --> 00:05:21,348
and lead us
through a dark time...

89
00:05:21,382 --> 00:05:23,515
He saved the devil
kingdom from ruin.

90
00:05:23,548 --> 00:05:25,448
Well, that explains
why Rias is the next heir

91
00:05:25,482 --> 00:05:27,348
to the house of Gremory.

92
00:05:27,382 --> 00:05:28,848
I had no idea.

93
00:05:28,882 --> 00:05:31,948
The House of Gremory will
always come before me...

94
00:05:31,982 --> 00:05:33,482
I've learned to adjust to it;

95
00:05:33,515 --> 00:05:35,915
and make personal
decisions accordingly.

96
00:05:38,982 --> 00:05:40,782
It's time, everyone.

97
00:05:40,815 --> 00:05:42,448
Then let's go.

98
00:05:58,582 --> 00:05:59,348
That's weird!

99
00:05:59,382 --> 00:06:01,715
I think our magic
circle's broken.

100
00:06:01,748 --> 00:06:02,915
Yeah, we're still here...

101
00:06:02,948 --> 00:06:04,615
Did I screw it up again?

102
00:06:04,648 --> 00:06:07,382
Your attention, please.

103
00:06:07,415 --> 00:06:09,548
Welcome everyone,
my name is Grayfia...

104
00:06:09,582 --> 00:06:11,682
I am a servant of
the house of Gremory.

105
00:06:11,715 --> 00:06:14,915
I will be your referee
during today's match.

106
00:06:14,948 --> 00:06:17,415
To create the battlefield you'll
be competing in,

107
00:06:17,448 --> 00:06:20,582
I took suggestions from both
Lady Rias and Lord Riser...

108
00:06:20,615 --> 00:06:21,982
You may recognize this place,

109
00:06:22,015 --> 00:06:24,748
as it's an exact replica
of Kuo Academy,

110
00:06:24,782 --> 00:06:26,982
an educational institution
in the human world.

111
00:06:27,015 --> 00:06:27,982
What does that mean?

112
00:06:28,015 --> 00:06:29,748
Just take a look outside.

113
00:06:33,415 --> 00:06:34,415
The sky!

114
00:06:34,448 --> 00:06:36,348
This is an alternate space.

115
00:06:36,382 --> 00:06:37,315
It might look like it,

116
00:06:37,348 --> 00:06:39,648
but trust me, we're
not at school anymore.

117
00:06:39,682 --> 00:06:40,582
Okay, I'm totally
having one of those

118
00:06:40,615 --> 00:06:43,048
'I just peed my pants'
moments right now.

119
00:06:43,082 --> 00:06:44,782
Each team has been given an area

120
00:06:44,815 --> 00:06:46,848
that will serve
as its home base.

121
00:06:46,882 --> 00:06:49,848
Lady Rias, your crew will be
in the Occult Research Club

122
00:06:49,882 --> 00:06:51,915
headquarters in
the old schoolhouse.

123
00:06:51,948 --> 00:06:52,982
Show me Phoenix.

124
00:06:53,015 --> 00:06:53,882
Yes, ma'am.

125
00:06:53,915 --> 00:06:55,815
Lord Riser's home
base will be located

126
00:06:55,848 --> 00:06:58,682
in the principal's office in the
new schoolhouse.

127
00:06:58,715 --> 00:07:00,382
Pawns will be promoted if they
can make

128
00:07:00,415 --> 00:07:03,315
their way to the home base of
the opposing team.

129
00:07:03,348 --> 00:07:04,815
Good luck to all.

130
00:07:04,848 --> 00:07:05,748
I'm gonna fight my way

131
00:07:05,782 --> 00:07:07,015
to their home base
right out of the gate,

132
00:07:07,048 --> 00:07:08,015
get promoted to
something awesome,

133
00:07:08,048 --> 00:07:10,548
and beat the crap out
of Lord Douche-nozzle!

134
00:07:10,582 --> 00:07:11,515
I wouldn't do that...

135
00:07:11,548 --> 00:07:14,348
Unless you wanna get
your ass handed to you.

136
00:07:14,382 --> 00:07:15,682
Be smart, dude...

137
00:07:15,715 --> 00:07:18,315
Odds are Riser's gonna
want to move his pawns

138
00:07:18,348 --> 00:07:20,082
into our territory right away...

139
00:07:20,115 --> 00:07:21,982
We need to keep
enough players nearby

140
00:07:22,015 --> 00:07:23,815
to make sure
that doesn't happen.

141
00:07:23,848 --> 00:07:26,448
So not as badass as my plan.

142
00:07:27,448 --> 00:07:29,415
Uh... Thanks?

143
00:07:30,348 --> 00:07:32,782
These'll help us
communicate during the battle.

144
00:07:32,815 --> 00:07:35,848
Alright, that's some
secret agent shit.

145
00:07:37,648 --> 00:07:38,715
All right devils...

146
00:07:38,748 --> 00:07:41,948
Let the game begin!

147
00:07:43,948 --> 00:07:48,015
Those failures don't deserve to
stand on the same field as us...

148
00:07:48,048 --> 00:07:49,982
Show no mercy!

149
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:52,582
Break their spirits,
shatter their pride,

150
00:07:52,615 --> 00:07:54,515
and force them
into submission...

151
00:07:54,548 --> 00:07:57,548
If I don't crush her,
this is meaningless.

152
00:07:58,048 --> 00:08:00,082
The enemy base is
just across the way.

153
00:08:00,115 --> 00:08:01,815
Cutting through the school
grounds might be quick,

154
00:08:01,848 --> 00:08:03,415
but it's not an option.

155
00:08:03,448 --> 00:08:05,315
They'll see us
coming a mile away.

156
00:08:05,348 --> 00:08:06,448
Correct...

157
00:08:06,482 --> 00:08:08,348
And we might as
well be sitting ducks.

158
00:08:08,382 --> 00:08:10,382
If we go through the track field
and sneak in the back,

159
00:08:10,415 --> 00:08:12,782
then we might have the
element of surprise on our side.

160
00:08:12,815 --> 00:08:15,048
That's the most obvious
entry-point available...

161
00:08:15,082 --> 00:08:16,848
And Riser knows it.

162
00:08:16,882 --> 00:08:19,448
My guess is he'll station
a group of knights or rooks

163
00:08:19,482 --> 00:08:22,682
with strong mobility right
behind the athletic clubhouse.

164
00:08:22,715 --> 00:08:25,782
That doesn't leave us with
very many options then, does it?

165
00:08:25,815 --> 00:08:27,048
First things first.

166
00:08:27,082 --> 00:08:28,648
I think we should
secure the gymnasium

167
00:08:28,682 --> 00:08:30,382
before we do anything else.

168
00:08:30,415 --> 00:08:31,648
Its adjacent to their home base

169
00:08:31,682 --> 00:08:33,348
and not too far from us...

170
00:08:33,382 --> 00:08:34,382
but most importantly,

171
00:08:34,415 --> 00:08:37,382
it will serve as a
diversion to the other side.

172
00:08:37,415 --> 00:08:40,415
The gymnasium's basically in
the center of the battlefield...

173
00:08:40,448 --> 00:08:43,715
Whoever gets to it first is
gonna have a leg up for sure.

174
00:08:43,748 --> 00:08:44,848
Good call...

175
00:08:44,882 --> 00:08:47,615
Given the options we have,
that's our best chance...

176
00:08:47,648 --> 00:08:48,882
Koneko, do you
think you can handle

177
00:08:48,915 --> 00:08:51,548
getting in the gym
and locking it down?

178
00:08:52,082 --> 00:08:54,515
All this talk of fighting
is starting to scare me.

179
00:08:54,548 --> 00:08:55,948
Relax, we've got
Rias, all we have

180
00:08:55,982 --> 00:08:58,315
to do is trust her
and we'll be just fine.

181
00:08:58,348 --> 00:08:59,782
Yeah, I guess you're right.

182
00:08:59,815 --> 00:09:02,782
To do that, we need to secure
a defensive perimeter...

183
00:09:02,815 --> 00:09:03,915
Kiba and Koneko...

184
00:09:03,948 --> 00:09:06,748
Get out there and set some
traps in the woods, a-sap.

185
00:09:06,782 --> 00:09:07,548
Got it.

186
00:09:07,582 --> 00:09:08,615
Cool.

187
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:10,048
Let's do this, Shiro.

188
00:09:14,815 --> 00:09:16,682
Well, wish us luck, you guys!

189
00:09:17,915 --> 00:09:18,682
Akeno...

190
00:09:18,715 --> 00:09:20,715
Next we'll need
your expertise...

191
00:09:20,748 --> 00:09:21,982
When they're done
setting the traps,

192
00:09:22,015 --> 00:09:24,882
your illusion magic is going to
come in handy, so be prepared.

193
00:09:24,915 --> 00:09:27,548
I'll be waiting.

194
00:09:29,715 --> 00:09:30,648
What about me and Asia;

195
00:09:30,682 --> 00:09:32,682
is there anything we
can do to help you out?

196
00:09:32,715 --> 00:09:34,782
Asia, you're my healing
support, so in order

197
00:09:34,815 --> 00:09:36,915
to keep you safe, you need
to stay close to base...

198
00:09:36,948 --> 00:09:38,315
Because if we lose you,

199
00:09:38,348 --> 00:09:39,982
we're going to be in
big trouble out there.

200
00:09:40,015 --> 00:09:41,848
Okay!

201
00:09:41,882 --> 00:09:43,082
Issei, come here.

202
00:09:43,115 --> 00:09:46,482
For what?

203
00:09:46,515 --> 00:09:49,582
I want you to put
your head in my lap.

204
00:09:52,515 --> 00:09:53,415
Really?

205
00:09:53,448 --> 00:09:54,648
I'm trying to focus
on this game thing,

206
00:09:54,682 --> 00:09:56,448
and I'm pretty sure that if
I do that I'll be focusing on--

207
00:09:56,482 --> 00:09:58,715
Will you get over here?

208
00:09:58,748 --> 00:10:00,848
Your wish is my command.

209
00:10:03,982 --> 00:10:06,748
It's like I'm floating on a
cloud made of juicy thighs

210
00:10:06,782 --> 00:10:08,715
and the scent of a woman.

211
00:10:11,348 --> 00:10:12,382
Rias...

212
00:10:12,415 --> 00:10:14,415
I want you to know
I could die happy right now...

213
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:16,882
This is one of the top
ten moments of my life.

214
00:10:16,915 --> 00:10:18,882
Why in the world are you crying?

215
00:10:18,915 --> 00:10:20,048
Cause...

216
00:10:20,082 --> 00:10:21,748
I'm just so overwhelmed that
you're actually letting me

217
00:10:21,782 --> 00:10:23,915
lie with my head
buried in your business,

218
00:10:23,948 --> 00:10:27,015
this is, hands down, the nicest
thing anyone's ever done for me!

219
00:10:27,048 --> 00:10:28,215
You are such a drama queen...

220
00:10:28,248 --> 00:10:31,648
If you like it that much,
you can do it again sometime.

221
00:10:31,682 --> 00:10:33,348
Are you serious?

222
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:36,315
Wipe your nose,
you're snotting on me.

223
00:10:37,648 --> 00:10:38,648
Issei...

224
00:10:38,682 --> 00:10:40,548
I cast a little spell on you...

225
00:10:40,582 --> 00:10:43,015
It's time to unlock it.

226
00:11:02,534 --> 00:11:03,067
Nice...

227
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,634
Onto the next one.

228
00:11:08,634 --> 00:11:10,100
All right, off you go.

229
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:20,134
What is this...?

230
00:11:20,167 --> 00:11:21,867
What's happening to me?

231
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,034
When you became a foot soldier,

232
00:11:23,067 --> 00:11:25,634
I told you it used
eight of my pawn pieces,

233
00:11:25,667 --> 00:11:28,800
but what I didn't tell you was
how much power you'd received.

234
00:11:28,834 --> 00:11:29,734
Wait, what?

235
00:11:29,767 --> 00:11:31,800
If I had unleashed
everything all at once,

236
00:11:31,834 --> 00:11:33,867
your body wouldn't have
been able to take it...

237
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:36,767
So I cast a spell to
keep your power at bay...

238
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,000
Because of the spell,

239
00:11:38,034 --> 00:11:40,600
your abilities come to you in
small, manageable stages...

240
00:11:40,634 --> 00:11:43,767
What I just did was release
another portion of your power.

241
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,134
Uh, okay, so does that explain

242
00:11:45,167 --> 00:11:47,200
the weird feeling
I'm having right now?

243
00:11:47,234 --> 00:11:50,234
This is just the beginning
of what you can do, Issei...

244
00:11:50,267 --> 00:11:52,534
But in order for
your body to be able

245
00:11:52,567 --> 00:11:53,467
to handle your Boosted Gear

246
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,534
on top of the full
extent of your power,

247
00:11:55,567 --> 00:11:56,467
we had to get you in shape,

248
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,667
and make sure you
were strong enough...

249
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:59,734
There's a good portion in there

250
00:11:59,767 --> 00:12:01,600
that you're just
not ready for yet.

251
00:12:01,634 --> 00:12:03,600
So this whole time you
were running me ragged

252
00:12:03,634 --> 00:12:06,534
and busting my balls,
it was for my own good?

253
00:12:06,567 --> 00:12:09,134
And I thought I was being
punished for sucking so hard!

254
00:12:09,167 --> 00:12:10,067
This is awesome!

255
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,234
She doesn't hate me!

256
00:12:11,267 --> 00:12:12,767
Yaaaay!

257
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,534
There I was being jealous,

258
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,867
when all along Rias was
just trying to help him...

259
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:17,767
Dear God...

260
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,567
Please forgive me
for being so stupid

261
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,834
and letting my awful
jealousy get the best of me.

262
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,800
Do your best out there...

263
00:12:24,834 --> 00:12:28,167
Don't go easy on them just cause
your opponents are girls...

264
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,167
Take those pawns out...

265
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,967
Given the opportunity, they'll
do the same thing to you.

266
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,234
I won't let you down...

267
00:12:34,267 --> 00:12:37,234
Those devil hotties'll be sorry
they messed with Team Gremory!

268
00:12:37,267 --> 00:12:39,167
I can't wait to see
what you do out there...

269
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,067
I just know you're
going to make me proud.

270
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,634
Rias... Do you copy?

271
00:12:43,667 --> 00:12:45,567
I hear you loud and clear.

272
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,034
We're ready when you are,
just say the word.

273
00:12:51,867 --> 00:12:54,734
All right you guys,
here's the game plan.

274
00:12:54,767 --> 00:12:57,500
Gremory might be about
to make her first move.

275
00:12:57,534 --> 00:12:59,100
With as many pieces
as she's missing,

276
00:12:59,134 --> 00:13:01,200
Rias won't be able
to protect her home base

277
00:13:01,234 --> 00:13:02,900
and launch a full assault.

278
00:13:02,934 --> 00:13:04,067
Because of that...

279
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:08,067
She'll have to force her way
in with tertiary attacks.

280
00:13:08,867 --> 00:13:09,734
Okay...

281
00:13:09,767 --> 00:13:10,734
Once you're in the gym,

282
00:13:10,767 --> 00:13:12,934
there's no way you can
avoid a confrontation...

283
00:13:12,967 --> 00:13:14,600
Be sure to follow our plan.

284
00:13:14,634 --> 00:13:15,867
Got it.

285
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:16,534
Kiba...

286
00:13:16,567 --> 00:13:17,467
You all set?

287
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,200
Yep. I'm in position now.

288
00:13:19,234 --> 00:13:20,967
Akeno, stand by to move.

289
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,100
I'm counting on you.

290
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:23,567
We totally got this!

291
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,500
Let's go, team...

292
00:13:25,534 --> 00:13:28,100
Commence operation
'Phoenix Ashes!'

293
00:13:28,134 --> 00:13:29,734
Your opponent is Lord Riser,

294
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:32,667
a gifted warrior even among
the house of the Phoenix.

295
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:35,767
Show no mercy, because
none will be shown to you!

296
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,734
Good luck, guys...

297
00:13:39,767 --> 00:13:43,067
I'll be praying for each
and every one of you.

298
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:49,900
I can't believe how good
of a copy this place is.

299
00:13:49,934 --> 00:13:52,167
They're here.

300
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,834
Smells like Gremory filth...

301
00:13:53,867 --> 00:13:56,100
Come out, come out
wherever you are!

302
00:13:56,134 --> 00:13:57,467
Well, I guess the
stealth approach

303
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,800
isn't gonna work, is it?

304
00:14:01,067 --> 00:14:02,534
Look what we have here...

305
00:14:02,567 --> 00:14:04,567
She sent us a pawn and a rook...

306
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,467
Lil' Issei needed some help.

307
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,867
Who're they?

308
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:08,700
I'm Mira...

309
00:14:08,734 --> 00:14:10,067
And I'm a Phoenix pawn.

310
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,200
I'm Shueran, a Phoenix Rook.

311
00:14:12,234 --> 00:14:14,100
I'm Ile, and I'm a pawn!

312
00:14:14,134 --> 00:14:16,600
My name is Nel,
and I'm a also a pawn!

313
00:14:16,634 --> 00:14:17,734
The rook chick...

314
00:14:17,767 --> 00:14:19,934
She could be a
big problem for us.

315
00:14:19,967 --> 00:14:21,134
You really think so?

316
00:14:21,167 --> 00:14:24,034
Based on her power level,
she's got the skills of a Queen.

317
00:14:24,067 --> 00:14:25,467
That's no good.

318
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,534
Oh, what the hell,

319
00:14:26,567 --> 00:14:28,500
we knew we were underdogs
from the beginning...

320
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:29,867
Let's just do this.

321
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,167
Power-up... boost!

322
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,000
Boost!

323
00:14:33,034 --> 00:14:34,734
Those pawns are all you...

324
00:14:34,767 --> 00:14:36,534
I'll try my luck
with the rook...

325
00:14:36,567 --> 00:14:38,467
Watch my back out there...

326
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,667
At least keep those
chicken heads off me.

327
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:42,067
Don't worry, I'm not
gonna go easy on 'em

328
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:44,134
cause they're girls.

329
00:14:44,167 --> 00:14:46,100
I'll choke a chicken.

330
00:14:47,267 --> 00:14:48,967
Let's rock this!

331
00:14:49,767 --> 00:14:52,734
So she decided to attack
from the center, after all...

332
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:54,800
How are things on
the other front?

333
00:14:54,834 --> 00:14:55,734
My Lord.

334
00:14:55,767 --> 00:14:58,067
Your pawns Shulyer,
Marion, and Byurent

335
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,867
are moving in on
the enemy as we speak.

336
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:02,900
Damn, this fog is so thick;

337
00:15:02,934 --> 00:15:04,700
we won't be able
to see anything.

338
00:15:06,567 --> 00:15:07,667
A trap...?

339
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,867
Did they really think something
that lame would work?

340
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,800
The Gremorys are
dumber than I thought.

341
00:15:11,834 --> 00:15:14,634
A cute trick from a
Rating Game virgin.

342
00:15:26,034 --> 00:15:28,534
Hey, are you okay?!

343
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,000
Nice one.

344
00:15:58,034 --> 00:15:59,534
Who the hell are you...?

345
00:15:59,567 --> 00:16:01,000
Tell me!

346
00:16:02,734 --> 00:16:03,934
I'm Koneko...

347
00:16:03,967 --> 00:16:05,600
Suck it.

348
00:16:08,834 --> 00:16:10,567
Why are you running, pansy boy?!

349
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,700
What's the matter, you
not a fan of chainsaws?!

350
00:16:12,734 --> 00:16:14,934
I love chainsaws, almost
as much as I love twins,

351
00:16:14,967 --> 00:16:16,700
but you're ruining em both.

352
00:16:16,734 --> 00:16:17,734
Psychos!

353
00:16:19,634 --> 00:16:20,500
No way!

354
00:16:20,534 --> 00:16:23,100
Those girls are bat-shit!

355
00:16:23,134 --> 00:16:25,467
Slice him up, slice
him up, slice him up!

356
00:16:29,834 --> 00:16:31,534
Hey... I got this!

357
00:16:31,567 --> 00:16:31,967
You bastard...

358
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:32,700
Quit running!

359
00:16:32,734 --> 00:16:35,034
Come on, we just
wanna slice you!

360
00:16:35,934 --> 00:16:38,567
I've been working my butt off
to try and get stronger...!

361
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,467
All so when a moment
like one this came along,

362
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,700
I'd be ready to kick some ass!

363
00:16:42,734 --> 00:16:43,600
Boost!

364
00:16:43,634 --> 00:16:45,834
I'm gonna make Rias
proud of me today!

365
00:16:45,867 --> 00:16:47,934
Explosion!

366
00:16:47,967 --> 00:16:49,000
Guess what...?

367
00:16:49,034 --> 00:16:50,734
You're first!

368
00:16:50,767 --> 00:16:53,000
One!

369
00:16:53,034 --> 00:16:54,534
And two!

370
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,967
And here's three!

371
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,200
My staff... It's broken.

372
00:17:10,234 --> 00:17:10,900
Oww...

373
00:17:10,934 --> 00:17:12,534
Stupid hand...!

374
00:17:12,567 --> 00:17:13,234
That was awesome!

375
00:17:13,267 --> 00:17:15,034
I'm so freakin' hard core!

376
00:17:17,913 --> 00:17:19,613
We can't lose to this dweeb!

377
00:17:19,646 --> 00:17:23,313
If we do, Lord Riser's
gonna be pissed off!

378
00:17:23,346 --> 00:17:24,446
It's time to die!

379
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,046
Let's slice off his balls!

380
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,680
Want some?

381
00:17:30,613 --> 00:17:31,946
Bring it on!

382
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,913
Here's my special move!

383
00:17:35,446 --> 00:17:37,546
Time to geeeeeeeet...!

384
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:39,280
Naked.

385
00:17:52,546 --> 00:17:53,880
You ladies like that...?

386
00:17:53,913 --> 00:17:56,413
Since the first moment my tiny,
baby man-balls dropped,

387
00:17:56,446 --> 00:17:58,680
all I ever did was
undress girls with my eyes.

388
00:17:58,713 --> 00:18:00,080
But now, thanks
to lots of hard-work

389
00:18:00,113 --> 00:18:01,313
and my perverted powers,

390
00:18:01,346 --> 00:18:04,646
I just have to imagine you naked
and my vision comes true...!

391
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,780
Try and mess with me...?

392
00:18:05,813 --> 00:18:07,880
Tops are comin' off!

393
00:18:07,913 --> 00:18:08,913
What a freak.

394
00:18:08,946 --> 00:18:11,580
Who knows, maybe his
special move will work...

395
00:18:11,613 --> 00:18:12,880
Nothing will stop
a girl in her tracks

396
00:18:12,913 --> 00:18:15,046
like having her clothes
magically ripped off.

397
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,980
But you're right,
it's a little rapey.

398
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:17,713
Dirt-bag!

399
00:18:17,746 --> 00:18:18,580
Slime-bucket!

400
00:18:18,613 --> 00:18:20,680
You make me sick!

401
00:18:20,713 --> 00:18:23,380
Thanks, Asia!

402
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:27,980
Yes...!

403
00:18:28,013 --> 00:18:28,913
It's working!

404
00:18:28,946 --> 00:18:31,313
Oh, Issei.

405
00:18:31,346 --> 00:18:32,480
Try again.

406
00:18:37,013 --> 00:18:38,046
I did it!

407
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:38,946
Once more?

408
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:42,980
Sure...! Let me go
put some clothes on!

409
00:18:45,046 --> 00:18:47,613
You're doing so well!

410
00:18:47,646 --> 00:18:48,446
Crap...!

411
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,080
You've still got
your underwear on...

412
00:18:50,113 --> 00:18:51,846
It's all gotta come off!

413
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,980
Don't worry...

414
00:18:53,013 --> 00:18:55,046
I've got plenty of clothes
for you to strip away...!

415
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,580
Don't give up...!

416
00:18:56,613 --> 00:18:58,946
Make me naked!

417
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:00,746
This is all thanks to you, Asia!

418
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:02,380
Dude, you're such a loser.

419
00:19:02,413 --> 00:19:05,780
I thought you'd be proud!

420
00:19:05,813 --> 00:19:08,446
Nice job, you totally
took out the rook chick!

421
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,313
Koneko, Issei,
what's your status?

422
00:19:10,346 --> 00:19:11,446
We're good...

423
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,280
No great...

424
00:19:12,313 --> 00:19:13,780
The gym is now
under our control...

425
00:19:13,813 --> 00:19:14,680
And...

426
00:19:14,713 --> 00:19:15,646
The girls.

427
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,913
I made their clothes rip off.

428
00:19:17,946 --> 00:19:18,880
Good work, Issei...

429
00:19:18,913 --> 00:19:21,480
Akeno is in position
and she's ready to go...

430
00:19:21,513 --> 00:19:23,613
You need to get out
of there immediately.

431
00:19:25,746 --> 00:19:26,680
Hey, come back here!

432
00:19:26,713 --> 00:19:28,046
This fight isn't over yet!

433
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,613
Who runs away in
the middle of a battle?

434
00:19:37,046 --> 00:19:38,246
Boom.

435
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:42,013
Three of Lord Riser's pawns
and one of Lord Riser's rooks...

436
00:19:42,046 --> 00:19:42,846
Retired.

437
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,746
That was badass.

438
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:46,046
Yeah, 'badass' is
one way to put it...

439
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,613
She's the real deal.

440
00:19:47,646 --> 00:19:49,980
It's why her nickname's
The Priestess of Thunder.

441
00:19:50,013 --> 00:19:51,413
She knows how to
bring the boom...

442
00:19:51,446 --> 00:19:53,346
And she likes it.

443
00:19:54,413 --> 00:19:56,446
If she's the Priestess
of anything it's pain.

444
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,780
I'm just glad the
hardcore dominatrix

445
00:19:57,813 --> 00:20:00,380
isn't on the other team!

446
00:20:00,413 --> 00:20:01,946
I must say, I'm impressed...

447
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:04,046
Rias used an important
strategic position

448
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:07,546
to lure them into a trap,
and then blew it sky-high...

449
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:08,680
That was a bold move.

450
00:20:08,713 --> 00:20:09,546
You're right...

451
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:10,980
Although, now
Lord Riser has no choice

452
00:20:11,013 --> 00:20:12,813
but to unleash everything.

453
00:20:12,846 --> 00:20:13,946
True.

454
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:16,446
This battle's just begun.

455
00:20:16,913 --> 00:20:19,046
The Phoenixes still
have us outnumbered...

456
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,813
We'll need to buy Akeno
a little bit of time

457
00:20:20,846 --> 00:20:23,846
so she can be fully ready
for her second attack...

458
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:24,946
Once her power is replenished,

459
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:27,813
we'll start to make
preparations for our next move.

460
00:20:27,846 --> 00:20:30,313
Until then, stick to the
plan and I promise you,

461
00:20:30,346 --> 00:20:31,813
we will win this thing.

462
00:20:31,846 --> 00:20:33,013
So?

463
00:20:33,046 --> 00:20:35,513
We need to get to the athletic
field as soon as we can...

464
00:20:35,546 --> 00:20:37,313
Kiba's waiting for us there...

465
00:20:37,346 --> 00:20:39,380
If we see any
bad guys, we own them...

466
00:20:39,413 --> 00:20:40,580
Sound good?

467
00:20:40,613 --> 00:20:42,346
I just hope Kiba's doing okay.

468
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:43,780
He's all alone.

469
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,880
Do you think the
Gremorys really believe

470
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:50,913
these stupid traps are
going to slow us down at all?

471
00:20:50,946 --> 00:20:52,846
That's their
home base, isn't it?

472
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:57,813
What is this?

473
00:20:57,846 --> 00:20:59,780
Hello, ladies.

474
00:21:02,446 --> 00:21:04,013
You gals looking
for some company?

475
00:21:04,046 --> 00:21:06,013
Cause if you're feeling
lonely this evening,

476
00:21:06,046 --> 00:21:08,780
I might be the man for you.

477
00:21:08,813 --> 00:21:09,713
Damn...!

478
00:21:09,746 --> 00:21:11,613
We walked right into
that one, didn't we?

479
00:21:11,646 --> 00:21:12,980
What we lack in
man-power, girls,

480
00:21:13,013 --> 00:21:14,546
we make up for in brains.

481
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:15,446
I hate to burst your bubble,

482
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,546
cause you're kinda
my type, blondie...

483
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:18,713
But as cute as you are,

484
00:21:18,746 --> 00:21:21,013
do you think you can take
all three of us on at once?

485
00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:23,746
Why don't we find out?

486
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,646
Eh, knowing him,
he's probably taking on

487
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,913
their whole team without
even messing up his hair...

488
00:21:27,946 --> 00:21:28,646
But hey...

489
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:31,546
We might as well
give him a hand.

490
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:33,780
Touch me and I puke.

491
00:21:33,813 --> 00:21:34,713
Oh, come on, relax...

492
00:21:34,746 --> 00:21:37,013
I'm not gonna make
your clothes disappear.

493
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:38,913
I wish I could
make you disappear.

494
00:21:38,946 --> 00:21:40,046
She hates me...

495
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,513
But then again, I guess
that's nothing new, is it...?

496
00:21:42,546 --> 00:21:44,480
Hey, Koneko,
wait up just a second!

497
00:21:49,113 --> 00:21:50,713
Koneko!

498
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:56,680
Issei...!

499
00:21:56,713 --> 00:21:58,646
What happened to Koneko?!

500
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:03,546
Issei, talk to me!

501
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:06,580
Koneko!

502
00:22:06,613 --> 00:22:07,746
Give up, Rias...

503
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:09,946
No matter what you try.

504
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:12,680
Victory will be Riser's.

505
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,480
That's one.

506
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:50,346
The Princess of Ruin...

507
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:51,846
Twilight Healing...

508
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,580
Priestess of Thunder...

509
00:23:53,613 --> 00:23:54,980
Sword Birth...

510
00:23:55,013 --> 00:23:56,613
And Booster Gear...

511
00:23:56,646 --> 00:23:59,380
Such grand sounding names
when they're all together.

512
00:23:59,413 --> 00:24:00,980
But we are Phoenixes!

513
00:24:01,013 --> 00:24:04,513
And you cannot defeat us!
