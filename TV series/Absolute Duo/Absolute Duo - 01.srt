because he or she
will be your partner.

It looks like you and me
are teaming up, Imari.

that if your battle
isn't over in ten minutes,

Yes, you there.

Isn't it a bit extreme
to kick us out just because

we lost a battle?

This test's purpose,

is to teach you how to survive

only our first day!

I suppose souls are the
only things they can hurt,

power of my Blaze

[IMARI] It doesn't matter
what your power is, or how

164
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,958
strong or weak your
opponent may be.

165
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:23,500
If you lose once,
then that's it.

That's the kind of world that's
out there waiting for us.

And once you lose,
there are no do-overs.

Huh?

You know, Tor, I never thought
we'd meet again here

Tora? It is you!

[TORA]
Hmm. So you made it through the

178
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:03,333
I guess that makes
you and me both

179
00:12:03,416 --> 00:12:06,500
two more guinea pigs for
Sakuya Tsukumo, doesn't it?

180
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:09,166
Wow, that's a real negative
way of looking at things.

C'mon, think about it, man.

182
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:13,166
We got our Blaze powers
from those Lukifer things

183

she gave us.

184
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,750
There's gotta be an ulterior
motive for giving us those,

185
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:18,791
don't you think?

186
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:20,916
If you ask me, this whole
school is nothing but a big

and we're just lab rats

in her experiment.

Oh, hey, look, there's the
first-year classroom, Tora.

190
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:30,750
We should probably
get a move on.

the big hurry, "lab rat"?

Remember, your student ID can
also be used as a credit card.

You'll be paired up
with a partner

do everything together

to sharing a room.

Yes, dear?

Can you tell us why the
Academy has such a system?

258
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:42,833
Well, the answer to that
is once you graduate,

259
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:44,166
all of you will be placed

260
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:46,208
in the Dorn Agency's
peacekeeping corps.

261
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:48,458
And when you're there, you'll
be working in teams.

262
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:50,583
Primarily in teams of two!

263
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:52,041
So then I guess we're
getting used to what

264
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:53,916
life in the corps will be like.

doubling up as roommates!

While these Duos are temporary,

they are pre-assigned.

00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:29,125
And by "pre-assigned"
I mean that

00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:06,375
Maybe she wasn't too thrilled to
have me for a roommate, either,

323
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:07,958
and crashed someplace else.

324
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:10,166
[TOR]
Hmm?

325
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:11,333
[gasps]

326
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:21,083
I'm sorry.

327
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:23,250
I hope you don't mind
that I showered first.

328
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:26,791
Ah, wait, what the hell
are you wearing?

329
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:31,291
My pajamas.

330
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:34,500
Oh, no, no, no, those
are definitely not pajamas!

331
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:37,041
If I sleep in it,
that makes it pajamas.

332
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:38,833
What else would it be?

333
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:40,666
[screaming]

334
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:44,625
[clears throat]

335
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:47,250
Um. Why don't I just
reintroduce myself, okay?

336
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:48,333
Hi, I'm--

337
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:49,333
Tor, right?

338
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:50,791
[TOR]
Oh, so you remembered.

339
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:54,125
Your name's hard to forget.

340
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:56,208
It sounds a lot like the word
"Thor" that's used

341
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:58,000
in my homeland, Gimle.

342
00:18:58,083 --> 00:18:59,166
Gimle, huh?

343
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:01,500
And where exactly
in the world is that?

344
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:02,916
Scandinavia.

345
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,041
And Thor, of course, is
a thunder god and one of the

346
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:07,000
mightiest in all of
Norse mythology.

347
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:10,666
[JULIE]
It's a good name.

348
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:13,125
So cool, that's one of
the mightiest gods.

349
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:14,500
Hey, Tor?

350
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:15,958
Hey, Tor?

351
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:17,416
Is something wrong?

352
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,833
Um, no, it's just that--

353
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:21,250
Well, to be honest, I noticed
you were staring at me

354
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:22,666
all through class today,

355
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:23,958
kinda like you are now.

356
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:27,083
Do you mind explaining
to me why?

357
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:31,250
It's because I'm
interested in you, Tor.

358
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:32,250
Huh?

359
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:33,583
You heard me.

360
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:36,208
Really interested, in fact.

361
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:38,083
You're the only thing
I've thought about.

362
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:39,833
So by "interested,"

363
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:40,916
do you mean--?

364
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,791
Huh? Wait, hold on!

365
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:46,666
Aren't you taking
this a little too fast?

366
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,208
We just met this morning!

367
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:52,625
[gasps]

368
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:55,666
I saw you use this exact move
back at the Screening Rite.

369
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,875
And it's interested me
ever since.

370
00:19:57,958 --> 00:19:59,750
Oh. So...

371
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:01,625
--The move, huh?
--Yeah, Tor.

372
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:04,041
Do you think you could
teach it to me?

373
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:05,750
Um. I'm sorry.

374
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:09,875
But I can't 'cause it puts way
too much strain on the body.

375
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:12,416
If a girl your size tried it,
it might destroy her.

376
00:20:13,666 --> 00:20:15,250
So, I'm sorry, but I can't.

377
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:16,875
Are you sure, Tor?

378
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,875
That's too bad.

379
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:23,750
[TOR]
Hmm?

380
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:25,208
Are you okay?

381
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:27,166
My apologies.

382
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:29,000
It must be
the time difference.

383
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:31,250
I'm so tired,
I could fall asleep.

384
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:34,916
No problem. I'm sorry
I acted so spazzy tonight.

385
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,291
Now go get some sleep,
Miss Sigtuna.

386
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:40,541
Ja, Tor.
I think I will go do that.

387
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:44,250
So good night,
and sweet dreams.

388
00:20:47,416 --> 00:20:49,500
Hey, wait! I didn't
mean on the floor!

389
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:52,500
Where's your bed at? You're
gonna catch a cold out here!

390
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:53,708
[breathing softly]

391
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:56,208
Ahhh!

392
00:20:56,291 --> 00:20:58,000
Crap!

393
00:20:58,083 --> 00:20:58,916
[TOR grunts]

394
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:13,750
And it's still only
the first day.

395
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:17,041
I better turn in as well.

396
00:22:59,958 --> 00:23:02,375
[liquid pouring]

397
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,750
As if I could even sleep!

398
00:23:05,833 --> 00:23:07,708
[sighs]

399
00:23:07,791 --> 00:23:09,375
[JULIE]
What was that you just said?

400
00:23:10,666 --> 00:23:11,541
[groans sleepily]

401
00:23:12,666 --> 00:23:14,625
[TOR]
I'm sorry, did I wake you?

402
00:23:14,708 --> 00:23:16,500
Oh, nej.
What is that?

403
00:23:16,583 --> 00:23:18,916
It's just some instant
apple tea I made.

404
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,166
That's all.

405
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:23,291
It smells so good.

406
00:23:23,375 --> 00:23:25,083
Yeah, it does.

407
00:23:25,166 --> 00:23:26,791
Do you want some?

408
00:23:26,875 --> 00:23:27,708
Ja.

409
00:23:31,041 --> 00:23:32,958
Well, here you go.

410
00:23:33,041 --> 00:23:35,750
Thank you very much, Tor.

411
00:23:35,833 --> 00:23:37,291
Ah!

412
00:23:37,375 --> 00:23:41,083
Delicious.

413
00:23:41,166 --> 00:23:43,291
Hey, I've been
thinking, Miss Sigtuna.

414
00:23:44,416 --> 00:23:47,625
Nej, Tor.
"Julie" is fine, okay?

415
00:23:47,708 --> 00:23:49,291
Oh, all right then.

416
00:23:49,375 --> 00:23:50,750
Anyway, I'd like to
make this work

417
00:23:50,833 --> 00:23:52,333
till the real duos
are announced.

418
00:23:52,416 --> 00:23:54,708
--That okay, Julie?
--Ja, Tor.

419
00:23:54,791 --> 00:23:57,250
I'd very much like to
make this work as well,

420
00:23:57,333 --> 00:23:58,500
my new "partner."

421
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:06,125
[TOR] What exactly
does "Ja" mean anyway?

422
00:24:06,208 --> 00:24:08,666
[JULIE] It means "yes."
It's always "yes."

423
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:09,625
[TOR]
Ja!

424
00:24:09,708 --> 00:24:10,500
[JULIE]
Ja, "ja."

425
00:24:10,583 --> 00:24:11,416
[TOR]
Ja?

426
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,333
[JULIE]
Ja, "ja."

427
00:24:12,416 --> 00:24:13,333
[TOR]
Ja?

428
00:24:13,416 --> 00:24:14,791
[JULIE]
Next time, "Duo."

429
00:24:14,875 --> 00:24:16,833
[TOR]
Ja. That's deep.
