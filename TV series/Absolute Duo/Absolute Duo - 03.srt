Good morning!

00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:43,708
I'm so very excited that all of
you have worked out your Duos.

3
00:00:43,791 --> 00:00:46,041
From now on, you'll be
sitting in your Duos, too.

4
00:00:46,125 --> 00:00:48,958
You could even think of it
as sort of a new beginning.

5
00:00:49,041 --> 00:00:51,333
Although, I can already see that
some of you have decided

6
00:00:51,416 --> 00:00:53,291
to stay in the exact
same seats as before.

7
00:00:53,375 --> 00:00:56,208
Yeah. The two of us
fit together nicely.

Well, now that all of your Duos
have been officially decided,

it's just about time for us

how all of this will work.

the way you move is
a little bit awkward.

Right now, there's no way
I'll be up to snuff.

Hmm?

42
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:38,083
It's about how to use
your shield.

43
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:39,916
I want you to try to punch me.

44

That's too close for it to work!

That was one step
too close, huh?

Try it from here then.

49
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:55,375
On "I," step forward while
blocking your opponent's attack.

50
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:57,708
And on "two,"
strike with Mjolnir.

51
00:03:57,791 --> 00:03:59,166
What is "Mjolnir"?

52
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:00,958
I hope it doesn't bother
you, but that's the name

53
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:02,666
I've given to your right fist.

54
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,750
Mjolnir is the most
powerful weapon

55
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:07,916
wielded by
the thunder god, Thor.

coming up with pet names?

57

So, what do you think?

58
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:15,000
I think you've got a
pretty excellent idea there.

59
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:23,458
Haaaaaah!

60
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,333
The thing is, this
attack isn't a Blaze,

61
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:30,000
so if it connects with anyone,
it'll hurt 'em for real.

62
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:32,208
That's why I don't want
to use it unless I have to.

63
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:38,625
Oh, I see.

64

All of that stuff aside,

65
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,875
I think this new way of using
my shield will totally work.

with me for a little while?

that I'm not particularly
good at anything.

is the most important part
of getting stronger.

120
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:55,791
So running's not
a bad idea at all.

Wha? Really?

122
00:06:58,416 --> 00:07:00,375
Talent doesn't mean
anything unless you've spent

123
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:02,583
enough time
working on the basics.

124
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:04,375
So if you don't give up
on the running,

you're sure to get stronger.

00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:15,708
Yeah.

167
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,541
[BOTH giggling]

Uh...

[BOTH shrieking]

170
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:38,208
Sneak attacks, mimicry,
and old-fashioned seduction.

171
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:40,166
I guess everyone has
their own tactics.

172
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:41,333
Yeah.

[TOR]
One hour left.

174
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,583
With so many Duos
out of the competition,

175
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:50,875
it'll be harder to find
who we fight next.

176
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:53,125
Why don't we go somewhere
we haven't been yet?

177
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:55,166
Ah. Do you mean?

178
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:04,125
Yah!

179
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:05,458
We've got to be careful.

180
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:07,458
It's clear that we're
now in striking distance.

[bells jingling]

[chuckles]

185
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:20,291
I figured that you were too
good for such a simple attack.

186
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:22,291
I've gotta say, I've really
been looking forward

187
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:23,916
to taking you two on.

188
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,333
And we feel
the same way about you.

189

What else is up her sleeve?

195

The Tachibana School covers
a variety of martial arts.

196
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:50,000
You should know,

197
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:52,916
this and judo
are my specialties.

198
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000

You've got me to deal with, too!

Tor, you cover
the back. Got it?

00:11:27,291 --> 00:11:29,208
Yeah, no problem, partner!

Come on!

[grunts]

216
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:51,958
I knew it.

217

I'm just not strong enough.

218

[TOR]
I'm impressed.

219
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:56,250
Huh?

220
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:57,958
Pushing me back
the way that you did.

221
00:11:58,041 --> 00:11:59,625
That's pretty incredible.

222
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:00,791
Nice job.

223
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:02,750
Yeah? You really think so?

224
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:04,083
I do.

225
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:06,291
There's no letting my
guard down around you now.

226
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:08,625
And I'll have to train harder.

227
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:10,458
I will, too!

228
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:12,416
Just you wait, you'll see!

stronger till I can--

That's right.

We'll both work hard.

233
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:20,166
Sound good?

234
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:21,833
Huh? Mm.

235
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:30,250
So this is you
with your gloves off.

236
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:33,250
You're good, but I refuse
to lose this fight!

It's not over!

And that's checkmate.

239
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,166
Did you actually see
that last attack

240
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:47,833
that came from behind you?

241
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:48,958
Yeah.

00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:50,666
I know that you're
very powerful,

243
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:53,083
so I have to stay
as alert as I can.

244
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:57,333
You win this round, Julie.

245
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:01,333
We both did our best.

00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:03,291
Yeah. We sure did!

The Novgladius isn't
quite over yet.

Looks like we have enough
time for one more match.

I'd like a go at Tora
and his partner.

00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:32,083
What in the world
happened to these two guys?

257
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:34,708
I don't know. We just
got here ourselves.

258
00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:36,958
They need medical
attention immediately.

Tora! Can you hear me?

260
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:39,916
Tora!

261
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,500
It's a trap,
you have get out of here.

262
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:42,708
A trap?

263
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:45,625
It was her,

264
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:47,291
behind you.

265
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:51,041
[evil laughter]

00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:53,416
Yaaaaah!

267
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,250
You know, it's a good thing
you guys are so quick,

268
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:57,125
because if you'd been
a split-second slower,

269
00:13:57,208 --> 00:13:59,250
my Blaze would have
chopped you right in half!

270
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:01,041
Why are you doing this?

271
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:02,500
I don't get it!

272
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:04,208
You haven't figured it out yet?

273
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:06,000
I attacked you
because I'm the one

274
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:08,166
who took out these
two cretins here.

275
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:09,541
No way.

276
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:11,666
Tor, do you have any injuries?
You should check.

277
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,541
Right. [grunts]

278
00:14:15,541 --> 00:14:16,791
You cut me.

279
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:18,375
How's this possible?

280
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:19,625
[chuckles]

281
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:21,708
You know what doesn't
make any sense to me?

282
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:24,125
These weapons could
smash through a brick wall

283
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:27,458
and yet, they don't seem
to do any harm to humans.

284
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:30,958
Blaze power is just the physical
manifestation of one's soul,

285
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:32,416
and, as we all know,

286
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:35,625
one's mental attitude can
shift in a variety of ways!

287
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:40,083
Your reactions are
truly impressive.

288
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:43,000
So you're saying if you wield
a Blaze with deadly intent,

289
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:45,583
that it can actually be used
to injure your opponent?

290
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:46,750
Looks like you're finally

291
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:48,583

Lesson one! 'Kay?

294

You can in fact use your Blaze
to hurt or even kill someone.

295
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:58,041
But this information
is super classified,

296
00:14:58,125 --> 00:14:59,916
so you're gonna have
to keep it to yourselves!

297
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:03,416
And now for tonight's
second lesson.

298
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:07,750
We'll find out what happens when
someone's Blaze is destroyed!

Tora!

302
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:14,750
As you can see here,

303
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:16,333
His psyche takes enough damage

304
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,541
to keep him knocked out
for at least a day.

305
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:19,958
But if you stop
and think about it,

306
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:21,541
things could be
a whole lot worse

307
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:24,375
considering his spirit has been
pretty much annihilated.

308
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:25,625
You monster.

309
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:27,125
Why would you do that to him?

310
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:28,875
This is all in a day's work.

311
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:31,125
I guess you could think of it
as my own special way of

312
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:34,000
dealing with some of our
most promising newcomers.

313
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:37,250
Enough talk. I say we get
back to the business at hand.

314
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:38,666
[laughs]

315
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,166
It's time for you to die.

316
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:45,333
Above us! Tor!

Too bad, so sad!

323
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:56,208
Come on, put your back into it

324
00:15:56,291 --> 00:15:58,166
since you're fighting
for your life and all!

325

[groans]

326
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,666
Pathetic.

327
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:04,875
This was even easier than
I thought it was going to be!

[screams]

329
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:13,416
Looks like it's
game over for you!

00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:17,000
Are you all right?

332
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:18,083
Yeah.

333
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:20,125
Do you think now is
really the time

334
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:22,125
to worry about anyone
but yourself?

335
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:24,833
[groaning]

336
00:16:24,916 --> 00:16:27,833
You're trying your best,
but it's not good enough.

337
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:29,791
You're going to die
because you're weak!

338
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:34,416
She only died
because she was too weak.

339
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,125
[growling]

340
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:38,666
Shut up!

341
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:39,541
Yah!

342
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:40,625
[gasps]

343
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:46,416
Oh, goodness!

344
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,250
If only that had
connected, am I right?

345
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:52,166
It's the time between attacks
that's really killing you!

346
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:54,000
[laughs maniacally]

347
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:55,458
[growls]

[TOR groans]

349
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:06,750
Are you okay, Tor?

350
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:08,666
[TOR grunts]

351
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:11,500
But she's definitely a
whole lot stronger than me.

352
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:13,916
And she's also a whole
lot faster than me.

353
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:18,916
All we need is one opportunity.

354
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,750
We could take her down if we
just landed a single solid hit.

355
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:24,000
I don't think there's any way
we're gonna get that lucky.

356
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:30,833
What, Tor?

357
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:33,375
So!

358
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:36,666
Have you decided which
one of you will die first?

359
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:39,375
Nej. I'll protect Tor
no matter what!

360
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:43,458
Ha! You two make
such an adorable young Duo.

361
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:47,250
It's hard-working students like
you who make your teacher proud!

362
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:50,333
Tor!

363
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:52,000
If you want to get to her,

364
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:53,416
you're gonna have
to go through me!

365
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,625
Ha! Fine with me,
you irregular freak!

366
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:59,083
If you want to be the first
to die, then so be it!

367
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:01,083
[grunting]

368
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:04,583
Take that!

369
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,625
And that! And that!

370
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:08,125
You can't do this alone!

371
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:09,166
Stay back!

372
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:10,833
I can handle this!

373
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:12,291
Let me help!

374
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:14,958
Guess what? You can swing
that sword of yours all day,

375
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:16,708
but it's never going
to dent my shield!

376
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:19,125
Bluffing isn't going to do
you any good here!

377
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:25,416
You were tenacious,
I gotta give you that,

378
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:28,250
but I'm afraid this is where
you bid your life farewell.

379
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:29,833
If you've got
any witty last words,

380
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:31,625
then now is the time
to say them.

381
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:33,583
[laughs maniacally]

382
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:34,916
All right.

383
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,916
I think there's only
one thing left to say and...

384
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:39,625
It's Julie, I...

385
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:41,958
[laughs]
Hang on!

386
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:44,708
You're confessing
your love for her now?

387
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:46,791
You guys are a barrel of laughs.

388
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:49,208
But the real fun will be
cutting you into ribbons!

389
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:52,583
Hiyaaah!

390
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:55,416
What?

391
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,958
Okay, Tor, take two!

392
00:18:57,041 --> 00:18:58,291
[yelling]

393
00:18:58,375 --> 00:19:00,291
You're still far too slow!

394
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:05,041
My Blaze? You can't!

395
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:06,833
Thanks for
all the lessons, Professor!

396
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:08,416
Now it's time to smash it.

397
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,791

[RITO screaming]

399

Let's toast to our
Novgladius victory.

400
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:27,833
Yeah.

401
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:29,083
Ow, ow, ow.

402
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:32,625
Julie,

403
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:35,125
you did a heck of a job jumping
in for that last combination.

404
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:36,916
Thanks to you,
I could focus long enough

405
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,291
to make that attack count.

406
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:39,875
I really appreciate it.

407
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:43,750
We did practice the "I, two"
combo over and over again.

408
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:45,125
Thing is,

409
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:47,250
Only you would realize
in all that craziness

410
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:49,875
that you had the power to
destroy Miss Tsukimi's Blaze.

411
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:52,625
Well. With Tora
and Tatsu both safe,

412
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:54,250
and Tsukimi apprehended,

413
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:56,125
I think we're all right for now.

414
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:57,708
Except.

415
00:19:57,791 --> 00:20:00,250
Why would she say that
it's "all in a day's work"?

416
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:02,458
What do you think
she meant by that?

417
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:03,541
Mm.

418
00:20:04,916 --> 00:20:06,875
Not that you'd know
anything about it.

419
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:08,666
The best thing
we can do right now

420
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,208
is focus on tending
to your wounds.

421
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:11,875
Yeah. Right.

you out a little?

any better today, Tor?

This isn't what it
looks like, I swear!

a bad dream, that's all.

and get some fresh air.

back to sleep, okay?

Is that the real reason
you're doing all of this?

took the Lukifer?
