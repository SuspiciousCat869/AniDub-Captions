Uh...

00:01:04,333 --> 00:01:05,541
Um, Julie.

00:01:05,625 --> 00:01:06,500
Listen.

12
00:01:06,583 --> 00:01:07,583
Did you--

13
00:01:07,666 --> 00:01:08,583
Sleep well?

14
00:01:08,666 --> 00:01:09,875
Ja. Good morning.

00:01:09,958 --> 00:01:12,291
Oh. Morning.

00:01:12,375 --> 00:01:14,750
No, wait! Did you
sleep up here last night?

[FEMALE STUDENT]
Hey, isn't that--

18
00:02:53,458 --> 00:02:55,416
[MALE STUDENT] That's them,
and I heard he's an Irregular.

00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,208
[FEMALE STUDENT] I didn't know
coed Duos were even allowed.

are already flying.

Is something wrong, Tor?

Huh? No. It's fine.

23
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:06,416
Hey, why don't we
sit right here?

24
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,375
Ja.

00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:14,041
Please bless this food.

00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:15,833

Good morning, Tor.

28
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:20,708
Hmm?

29
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:22,750
Yes. Morning.

30
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:24,583
Do you guys mind
if we join you?

31
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:26,458
Oh no, go right ahead.

32
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:29,083
Um, your names are
Tomoe and Miyabi, right?

33
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:31,625
Mhmm. That's us
and thanks so much.

34
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:38,333
Whoa, what are you eating,

35
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:40,333
the carnivore's delight
breakfast or something?

36
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:42,375
I guess I just
really like meat.

37
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:45,333
[sighs]
That's not too healthy.

38
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:47,166
A meal should be
balanced with items from

39
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,416
each food group, you know.

40

[giggles awkwardly]

42
00:03:52,416 --> 00:03:55,041
Sorry 'bout her. I guess you
could say that Miyabi's still

43
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:56,583
a little awkward around guys.

44
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:57,541
Oh, yeah?

[TOMOE]
Let's get down to brass tacks.

48
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:11,083
The reason we chose to sit
here today should be obvious.

49
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:13,875
We are quite concerned
about the two of you.

50
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:14,833
Concerned?

51
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:16,708
Well, rules notwithstanding.

52
00:04:16,791 --> 00:04:20,041
You're a guy and girl.
Both living in the same room.

53
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:22,666
Tell me. Isn't that awkward?

54
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,458
I mean, aren't you guys

55
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:26,375
a little weirded-out about it?

56
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:29,583
Nej. Tor is a
wonderful roommate.

57
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:31,083
Oh. How so?

58
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:32,833
He not only
carried me to bed,

59
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:34,458
but he also slept
with me last night.

60
00:04:35,416 --> 00:04:36,916
[BOTH whimper awkwardly]

61
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,333
No, wait, listen, you're
taking it the wrong way.

62
00:04:39,416 --> 00:04:41,791
This is just a big
misunderstanding, I swear!

63
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:43,833
I thought you
were a nice guy!

64
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:46,166
But you're a perv!

65
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:48,250
And a dog!

66
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:49,916
[RITO] It's said that
one person in a thousand

67
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,458
is suited for a Lukifer.

68
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,375
Now those people who've
been given Lukifers

69
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:55,208
not only get physically
stronger, class,

70
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:57,750
but mentally as well,
as the spirit-like entity

71
00:04:57,833 --> 00:04:59,583
inside them gains power!

72
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:01,750
There's a name for that
soul-power once it takes shape,

73
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:03,583
so what is it,
you with the glasses?

74
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:06,083
Torasaki! And to
answer your question,

75
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:08,750
the embodiment of soul-power
is known as a Blaze, ma'am.

76
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:09,916
Bingo!

77
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,083
Next question,
what is the proper term

78
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:14,291
for those chosen people
suited for Lukifers

79
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:15,875
who can use a Blaze, class?

80
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:17,666
Mmmm, you,
with the boobs!

81
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:22,916
Um. Those people
are called Exceeds.

82
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,708
Bingo once again!

83
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:26,875
As for Blazes, they're
normally traditional

84
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:28,875
weapons of simple construction.

85
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:31,666
They can be swords or spears,
and in the case of Irregulars,

86
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,208
even stranger things, right?

87
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,166
You, the cohabitator!

88
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,791
We're not "cohabitators,"
we're roommates.

89
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:39,208
[STUDENTS laugh]

90
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:40,166
Huh?

91
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:42,000
[laughs awkwardly]

[growling]

94
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:48,541
All right, let's move on, class!

95
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:50,000
[sighs]

96
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:53,250
So yesterday it was you
and today it's Tomoe, huh?

97
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:55,750
I don't understand
why she's so upset.

98
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:57,916
It's because of what
you said this morning.

99
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,541
Y'know, about us
"sleeping together."

100
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:01,625
Hmm?

101
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:02,791
In our language...

102
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:06,625
it can also mean
something else.

103
00:06:06,708 --> 00:06:07,916
[whispering]

104
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,041
Uh, I'll clarify what
really happened for her.

105
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:15,500
Please do.

106
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:18,583
Aside from that, you speak
our language really well.

107
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:21,041
Thank you.
My mama is an interpreter.

108
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:22,250
She taught me.

109
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:24,500
Oh. That's really neat.

110
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:26,291
Hmm?

111
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:28,041
But not the written
language, I see.

112
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:31,750
Nej, I'm still trying
to get the hang of it.

113
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:34,083
And since the Lukifer's
physical enhancement

114
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:36,666
serves as a multiplier, who
can tell me what that means?

115
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,791
You, Muscles!

116
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:40,375
[grunts]

117
00:06:40,458 --> 00:06:41,875
Right!

118
00:06:41,958 --> 00:06:43,791
The more you train your body,
the stronger you'll get--

119
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:46,166
exactly like he just said!

120
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:47,333
[grunts]

121
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:49,500
[STUDENTS]
What? How'd she understand that?

122
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:51,041
So therefore,

123
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:52,958
our curriculum
includes lots and lots

124
00:06:53,041 --> 00:06:54,666
of battle training you'll
need to get stronger.

125
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:57,666
By the time it's done,
all of you will be muy macho!

126
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,166
[STUDENTS]
But we don't want to be macho!

127
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:01,625
Now class,

128
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:03,666
listen up, because Lukifers
have levels you can raise

129
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,083
in the Rite of Sublimation.

130
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:06,791
It's always held
at the end of term

131
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:08,583
and it requires
everything you've got.

132
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:10,166
Without training
both body and mind,

133
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,166
your Lukifer levels
will never rise!

134
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:14,791
Plus, if you don't raise them
by a single level all year,

135
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:17,208
then I'm afraid
you'll be expelled.

136
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:18,291
[STUDENTS]
Expelled?

137
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:21,000
You don't want that to happen,

138
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:22,541
which is why the next
thing we're diving into

139
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:23,833
is battle training!

140
00:07:23,916 --> 00:07:25,666
Hooray! [giggles]

141
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,041
[drum roll]

142
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:28,791
[TOMOE] I bow down
and beg your forgiveness!

143
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:30,583
Wait, where did that come from?

144
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:33,208
I jumped to conclusions this
morning in the dining hall

145
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:35,708
but Julie explained everything
to me and I'm sorry.

146
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:38,083
I'm glad we got that cleared up,
but would you please

147
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,166
stop bowing down
in front of me like this?

148
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,750
But I feel this is the only
way I can make things right!

149
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:44,583
Come on,
knock it off, please!

150
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:46,208
It'll keep hanging
over me though!

151
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:47,166
Um...

152
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:48,875
Look, you already apologized

153
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:51,208
so you don't have to
do anything else, okay?

154
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:53,333
People are already
getting the wrong idea.

155
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:54,416
[gasps]

156
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:57,625
That guy's got game.

157
00:07:57,708 --> 00:07:59,500
Ew, in the gym?

158
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:00,958
Oh, Tor!

159
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:02,250
I'm sorry for that, too!

160
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:03,791
I'll keep bowing down
till you forgive me!

161
00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:05,916
No, stop, you're making
things even worse!

162
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,833
Oh. Yeah, you're right.

163
00:08:07,916 --> 00:08:09,750
Sorry!

164
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:11,125

329
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:58,625
[GIRLS giggling]

330
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:01,083
OMG, that was so embarrassing!

331
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:02,291
I know!

332
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:04,458
I wonder why Professor
Bunbun never told us

333
00:16:04,541 --> 00:16:05,875
we'd have to do that.

334
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:08,000
Tell me about it--
my heart is still pounding!

335
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:09,833
--What the--?
--What that was about?

336
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:11,375
[FEMALE RECEPTIONIST]
Applying for a Duo?

337
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:13,166
I'll need your student IDs,
please.

338
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:19,291
Okay, since these are in order,
I'll just need you two

339
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:20,708
to pledge your Duo-hood.

340
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:21,958
Hold on, pledge?

341
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:23,583
Our Duo-hood?

342
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:25,750
You put one Blaze
over the other.

343
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:27,500
And then to make
your Duo official,

344
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:30,166
all you have to do is recite
this pledge and it will be.

345
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:33,708
Well, go ahead.

346
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,500
Do we have to read this stuff?

347
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:38,041
[FEMALE RECEPTIONIST]
Yup, that's the rule.

348
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:39,708
You're taking
the plunge, too, huh?

349
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,458
Hi, Tomoe.

350
00:16:42,541 --> 00:16:43,583
Miyabi.

351
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:45,208
Why are you two here?

352
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:47,791
[TOMOE] Just turning in our
application like you guys.

353
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:49,041
Right?

354
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:51,125
Yes. Even though
I'm still a little worried

355
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:53,333
that my lack of ability
might hold you back.

356
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:55,416
Well, you shouldn't be
and it won't!

357
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,958
Out of all the students
here at Koryo Academy,

358
00:16:58,041 --> 00:17:00,000
only one could be
my Duo partner.

359
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:03,000
And I know without a doubt
that person is definitely you.

360
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:04,875
Wait, hold on just a second!

361
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:08,041
I thought... you were
teaming up with Julie.

362
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:10,916
Well, she did ask me
about becoming a Duo.

363
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,625
But by that time, I already
decided on Miyabi.

364
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:15,916
I'm afraid I had to
turn her down.

365
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,166
What?

366
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,875
Then Julie...

367
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:22,583
Um, guys?

368
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:25,666
If your Duo's to be official,
you have to say the pledge.

369
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:28,250
Tora, I'm sorry!

370
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:30,125
I understand.
Now go!

371
00:17:57,916 --> 00:17:59,208
[TOR]
One hour left.

372
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:08,791
[bells jingling]

373
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:10,000
Was that...?

374
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:28,041
[TOR]
Julie!

375
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:35,166
Tor.
What is it?

376
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:40,666
I've been looking
everywhere for you.

377
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,750
Why are you here?

378
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:43,833
Mm.

379
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,375
Because I thought,

380
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,708
maybe I could see
Gimle from this spot.

381
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:51,875
Well, can you?

382
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:57,166
[TOR]
I heard Tomoe turned you down.

383
00:18:58,250 --> 00:18:59,333
Why didn't you tell me?

384
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:03,708
Because talking about it
wouldn't change anything

385
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:05,375
for one reason,

386
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:08,583
and another was that I
didn't want to bother you.

387
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:11,166
But we're a Duo. You can
always be honest with me.

388
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:18,541
Look, temporary or not,
we're still a Duo.

389
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:20,791
Partners are supposed
to rely on each other.

390
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:28,291
Julie.

391
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:31,583
Let's make
our Duo official.

392
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:33,833
[gasps]

393
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:36,958
But what about Tora?

394
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:39,750
Don't worry about him.
He understands.

395
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:42,791
And what if Tomoe gets
the wrong idea about us again?

396
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:46,125
You can straighten
things out with her again.

397
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:48,458
I don't have a grasp
of the written language.

398
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:50,583
I'll teach it to you then.

399
00:19:50,666 --> 00:19:52,708
Um. Okay.

400
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:56,333
But if I say yes,
what happens if

401
00:19:56,416 --> 00:19:57,958
I drink all of your apple tea?

402
00:19:58,041 --> 00:20:00,166
I'll just buy some more,
it's not a big deal.

403
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:05,875
I want to protect you, Julie.

404
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:08,416
I want to be the one
you can rely on.

405
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,375
So please,

406
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:11,750
be a Duo with me.

407
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:13,791
[gasps]

408
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:22,375
You don't mind
pairing up with me?

409
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:28,666
Of course I don't.
I want to.

410
00:20:37,708 --> 00:20:39,125
Ja.

411
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:45,625
[BOTH] We two shall remain
bound together always.

412
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:48,916
And do everything as a Duo
to the best of our ability.

413
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,583
In joy and sorrow.

414
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,291
In sickness and in health.

415
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:54,000
Until death do us part.

416
00:22:37,791 --> 00:22:39,208
[TOR]
You're falling asleep.

417
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:40,875
You should get to bed.

418
00:22:40,958 --> 00:22:42,083
Ja.

419
00:22:50,291 --> 00:22:51,666
I didn't mean my bed.

420
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:54,291
Nej. A Duo is
always together.

421
00:22:54,375 --> 00:22:56,250
That doesn't mean
they have to share a bed!

422
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:58,708
Nej. We swore it, Tor.

423
00:22:58,791 --> 00:23:01,875
"To do everything as a Duo
to the best of our ability."

424
00:23:01,958 --> 00:23:04,166
Look, we can't keep
sleeping in the same bed

425
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:05,625
because it's really weird!

426
00:23:05,708 --> 00:23:06,833
But,

427
00:23:06,916 --> 00:23:09,041
I sleep with my mama
every night back home.

428
00:23:09,125 --> 00:23:11,333
That's sweet.
I'm like your mama?

429
00:23:11,416 --> 00:23:12,791
No, wait, that's creepy!

430
00:23:12,875 --> 00:23:15,416
Whoever you think I am,
I'm not your mama!

431
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,958
You are very special,
though, Tor.

432
00:23:18,041 --> 00:23:19,250
Uh.

433
00:23:19,333 --> 00:23:20,916
"Special" how?

434
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,625
Well, you feel kind of
like a papa to me.

435
00:23:23,708 --> 00:23:25,833
Oh. Really?

436
00:23:25,916 --> 00:23:28,250
Yes, so can I please
sleep up here with you?

437
00:23:28,333 --> 00:23:29,958
Mm.

438
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:32,208
Sure, but only this once.

439
00:23:32,291 --> 00:23:33,583
Ja.

440
00:23:33,666 --> 00:23:36,083
[groans] It's gonna be
another long night.

441
00:23:36,166 --> 00:23:37,958
What's that?

442
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:40,333
Ah, it's nothing.

443
00:23:40,416 --> 00:23:42,083
Oh, well then. Good night.

444
00:23:47,166 --> 00:23:48,541
And to you too, Tor.

445
00:23:48,625 --> 00:23:50,666
Good night.

446
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:53,083
[RITO] So we'll hop and skip
and jump and prance,

447
00:23:53,166 --> 00:23:55,166
and do the bunny dance!

448
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:59,333
La-la-la-la-la-la-
la-la-la-la-la-la!

449
00:24:02,333 --> 00:24:03,666
[TOMOE]
Now that Duos are decided,

450
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:05,125
it's time for our first battle.

451
00:24:06,541 --> 00:24:07,875
[MIYABI]
I hope we'll do okay!

452
00:24:07,958 --> 00:24:09,708
[TOMOE] Don't worry.
No matter how strong they are,

453
00:24:09,791 --> 00:24:12,458
no one can stand up
to the two of us, Miyabi!

454
00:24:12,541 --> 00:24:13,958
[JULIE]
Next time, "Avenger."

455
00:24:14,041 --> 00:24:16,000
[MIYABI] But I've got
a bad feeling about this.
