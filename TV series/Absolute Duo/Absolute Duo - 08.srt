Uh, hi, there yourself,
"Mi-boobie,"

168
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:23,875
no, wait, I mean Miyabi!

169
00:08:23,958 --> 00:08:25,500
You look nice.

170
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:27,416
Yeah. Great, in fact.

171
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,125
Oh! You think so, Tor?

172
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:31,958
Why thank you.

173
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:33,166
[LILITH giggles]

174
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:34,958
Well, Tor, I have to say
you're a pretty good

175
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:36,666
beauty contest judge.

176
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,708
[TOMOE] Yep. Now
let's get going, 'kay?

177
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:40,791
[IMARI] Right, the ocean
awaits, so come on!

178
00:08:42,083 --> 00:08:43,708
[ALL giggling]

179
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:46,208
[IMARI] Yahoo!

180
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:49,208
Actually, a dip right
now sounds like fun.

181
00:08:49,291 --> 00:08:50,458
Kick!

182
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:52,041
Hey, what was that for?

183
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:54,375
For neglecting me the way that
you did, you insensitive ape,

184
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:56,291
since you told all those
other girls how they looked

185
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:57,666
but not me!

186
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,625
So how do you like
me in beach mode?

187
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:02,458
Tell me what you
really think, okay?

188
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:05,458
Your beach mode seems to be
the same as your bitch mode.

189
00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:06,458
Oh, yeah?

190
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:07,750
So then tell me.

191
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:09,166
Do you think I'm
any more violent in

192
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:10,416
beach mode, you
rotten little brat?

193
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,500
[TOR]
You're cutting off my air!

194
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:12,791
[RITO]
Well? Huh?

195
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:14,958
[laughing]

196
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:16,958
Wow, those two sure
are close, huh?

197
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:19,083
I guess.

198
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:20,541
It must be nice.

199
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:26,125
Miyabi.

200
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:12,625
[TOR] Yep, the beach
was definitely

201
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:13,750
a good place to have fun.

202
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:17,375
Um.

203
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:18,750
Hi there, Tor.

204
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:20,666
Hey, do you think

205
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:21,875
you'd want to

206
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:22,958
swim with me?

207
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:23,875
Oh no!

208
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:25,083
Julie!

209
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,375
I told you not to go out alone!

210
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:32,833
Hey, look at this, Tor!

211
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:36,125
Thanks to you, I can swim
forward all by myself now.

212
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:37,291
I see.

213
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:38,333
Nice job, Juli--

214
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:43,458
Are you okay?

215
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:44,708
[JULIE coughing]

216
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:47,500
--Ja, I'm fine, thanks.
--[TOR screaming]

217
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:49,791
Julie? Up top! Look!

218
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:51,208
Hmm?

219
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:52,666
Looks nice and sunny.

220
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,875
No, your swimsuit!

221
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:57,625
Did you see anything?

222
00:10:57,708 --> 00:11:00,708
I did, but just barely.

223
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:02,791
Well, I guess "just barely"
is okay then.

224
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:05,625
But let's go get my
top back, all right?

225
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:07,583
Ah!

226
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:09,083
Wait.

227
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:10,916
Julie. Let go, would ya?

228
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:11,875
Nej, Tor.

229
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:13,416
I can't do that right now.

230
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,875
If I let go, then you
might get a peek.

231
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:16,833
Look.

232
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:18,375
My top's right there.

233
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:21,666
And what goes in it
is right against my back.

234
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,708
Oh, help me, Tor!
Look, I'm drowning!

235
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:25,000
Hey, come on now!

236
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:26,791
I know that you
know how to swim!

237
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:29,041
Yes, but not when I'm
drowning in your love!

238
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:30,500
[TOR]
Oh. You are not!

239
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:33,000
Knock it off, 'kay, and would
you please let go of me?

240
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:34,166
Hah!

241
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:35,875
If you're getting
cold feet, Irregular,

242
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:38,000
put some more
backbone into it, would ya?

243
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:40,250
Are these guys always like this?

244
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:42,666
Yes, they usually
are, unfortunately.

245
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,000
Good grief.

246
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:45,291
By the way,

247
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:48,250
have you noticed anything
about Miyabi lately?

248
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,833
[TOMOE]
Yeah. I sure have.

249
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:52,750
She'd been down on
herself for a while.

250
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:55,166
But now it seems like
she's recovered.

251
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,958
I'm glad. Is that what you mean?

252
00:11:58,041 --> 00:11:59,291
Yeah.

253
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:02,750
We'll be saying
goodbye tomorrow.

254
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:04,416
I guess a little
meddling can't hurt.

255
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,750
[TOR sighs]

256
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:12,833
Mmm, this is so nice.

257
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:14,625
Talk about relaxing.

258
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:16,000
The branch school
is lucky to have

259
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:18,375
a hidden gem like this place.

260
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:20,041
[MIYABI]
Wait, Miss Tsukimi!

261
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:21,333
No, don't!

262
00:12:21,416 --> 00:12:24,000
Stop! Please don't
grab them like that!

263
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:25,583
[RITO]
Oh, wow!

264
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:27,333
One touch is all it takes!

265
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:29,375
Look at how these
bazongas bounce!

266
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:30,958
[laughing]
[MIYABI] No!

267
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:33,208
[LILITH] I must admit you have
two amazing attributes there.

268
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:34,875
[MIYABI protesting]

269
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:37,000
[LILITH] In terms of bust size,
I know when I've been defeated,

270
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:38,375
therefore I concede to you.

271
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:40,458
[RITO] What's your
bra size, Miyabi?

272
00:12:40,541 --> 00:12:41,458
[gasps]

273
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:42,625
[MIYABI]
I'm not telling you that!

274
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:44,000
[RITO]
You better tell me!

275
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:45,375
[MIYABI]
Ah! Hey, no pinching!

276
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:46,750
"Pinching"?

277
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:48,708
[RITO] Or this'll keep
happening until you do!

278
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:49,833
Pinchy-pinch!

279
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:51,250
Pinchy-pinch!

[MIYABI screaming]

281
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:54,583
[MIYABI] I'll tell, I'll tell,
just please stop!

282
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:56,041
It's an F!

283
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:57,208
I wear an F!

284
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:02,125
Miyabi's an "F" for
"Fantasy Size?"

285
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:03,875
[MIYABI]
Ah! Stop!

286
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:05,041
They're not cantaloupes--

287
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:06,916
[LILITH] It's rare
I'm ever intimidated.

288
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,041
But now I guess I'll have to
consider her a real rival.

289
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:12,083
Oh, my, what a
strange phenomenon!

290
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,666
These are so soft
and supple, but these

291

little bits here
just got real hard!

That's enough!

If you really insist on
groping somebody's bosom,

then let it be mine
instead, Miss Tsukimi!

Ooh, this pair is worthy, too!

We're both about
the same size I'd say.

No, not you, too!

You like Tor, don't you?

[MIYABI]
Yeah.

Hey, wait a minute, you mean
that you can actually tell?

319
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:08,625
But how did you know?

320
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:10,125
Well, that's easy.

take your eyes off of him

since you got here.

[whimpers]

324
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:17,083
You've got some serious
competition for him.

325
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:19,250
That's true.

326

Professor Bunbun.

329
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:28,291
Then of course there's Tor's
Duo partner and roommate,

330
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:29,833
the exotic Julie.

331
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:31,791
I'd say she's your
biggest foe of all.

332
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:33,208
[MIYABI]
I know.

333
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:36,708
She's genuine, cute,
and incredibly strong.

334
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:39,916
So I don't stand a
chance against her.

335
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,125
[IMARI]
To be honest,

336
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:43,125
I really can't see
those two as a couple.

337
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:45,958
They seem to be more
like parent and child.

338
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:48,666
Or maybe even a
master and his dog.

339
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:49,875
C'mon.

340
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:52,125
Then again- you have
got a point there.

341
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:54,708
You know, I've seen you
looking at Tor a lot yourself.

342
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:57,083
Hmm?

343
00:14:57,166 --> 00:14:58,916
Um, You okay?

344
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,041
[laughs]

345
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:01,625
We both clicked
when we first met.

346
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:04,208
It was right before
the opening ceremony.

347
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:06,166
I figured that we'd end up
seeing a lot of each other.

348
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:10,833
And maybe even become
more than just good friends.

349
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:12,416
Except that

350
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,666
I failed the Screening Rite and
ended up here far away from him.

351
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:18,875
And that's the reason why I
want you to go for it, Miyabi.

352
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:21,541
So that you won't
have any regrets. 'Kay?

353
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:23,750
You're really sure?

354
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:25,083
[IMARI]
Go for it!

355
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,875
[MIYABI]
I will!

356
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:33,208
[violin playing]

357
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:38,958
[MIYABI] So how
exactly do I do this?

358
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:40,875
How do I get Tor to notice me?

359
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:42,458
[screams]

360
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:43,333
Huh?

361
00:15:43,416 --> 00:15:45,625
[MIYABI]
Ow!

362
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:47,000
[TOMOE]
Are you all right, Miyabi?

363
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:48,208
Uh-huh.

364
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:49,666
I think I just twisted it.

365
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,583
I wouldn't be so
sure about that!

366
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:53,250
In fact, you better
not walk on it until

367
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:54,875
you've gotten it checked out!

368
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:57,458
In the meantime, why don't
you just let Tor carry you?

369
00:15:57,541 --> 00:15:59,041
But I'm not that hurt!

370
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:00,916
No, Imari's right.

371
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,541
Well, then, hop on.

372
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:03,458
[giggles]

373
00:16:03,541 --> 00:16:05,083
Uh, okay.

374
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:06,625
Thanks so much, Tor.

375
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,291
[IMARI] Wow, will you
look at the time!

376
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:12,958
We better hurry back
because we're on

377
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:14,708
chow duty tonight, guys!

378
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:16,625
We are? This is the
first I've heard of it.

379
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:19,333
Oh, I must have forgot to tell
you they asked if we'd help out!

380
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:21,000
Well, it's almost dinner time,

381
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:23,208
so we better get a
move on and quickly, too.

382
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:26,333
[IMARI]
Tor, Miyabi,

383
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:28,458
we're gonna go on ahead, okay?

384
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:30,166
Oh, Lilith, Professor Bunbun,

385
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,625
you're both on kitchen
duty as well.

386
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:33,875
Hah!

387
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:35,916
Seeing those brats all
buddy-buddy the way they

388
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,375
really chafes my cheeks!

389
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:40,916
Wouldn't you agree, Miss Priss?

390
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,083
No, because everybody
gets a chance, I guess.

391
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:46,333
Not that anyone
else will win, though.

392
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:49,750
What was that about?

393
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:01,750
[TOR]
Hey, you know what?

394
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:04,791
This isn't the first time
you and I have done this.

395
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:06,291
I also carried you
after you collapsed

396
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:08,083
on the track, remember?

397
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:09,500
[MIYABI]
That's right, you did.

398
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:11,458
You even said some
words of encouragement

399
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:14,791
to me that day, and I can't tell
you how much I appreciated them.

400
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:16,375
They really brightened my day.

401
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:18,916
[TOR laughing] If that's all it
takes to cheer you up

402
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,708
I'll say anything you like.

403
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:23,750
Oh, you would?

404
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:27,000
Well, there is something I'd
like to hear you say to me.

405
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:29,250
And that's my name.

406
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:31,208
I know, that sounds weird but,

407
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:33,041
I'd like to hear you say it.

408
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:35,791
I'm sure Julie and Lilith
like hearing theirs.

409
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:38,416
So, will you, please, Tor?

410
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:41,208
Sure, of course.

411
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:44,416
I'd be happy to do
that for you, Miyabi.

412
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,041
[MIYABI]
Wow.

413
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:47,958
Thanks, Tor.

414
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:50,250
That means so much to me.

415
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:52,958
[TOR]
Oh, sure. Um, you're welcome.

416
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:57,083
[distant waves crashing]

417
00:17:57,166 --> 00:17:58,791
[BOTH gasp]

418
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:00,625
[MIYABI]
How beautiful.

419
00:18:00,708 --> 00:18:01,750
[TOR]
Yeah.

420
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:03,625
It's breathtaking.

421
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:06,541
Tor, I think I'd like to
walk on my own now.

422
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:08,208
You sure your foot can take it?

423
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:11,125
It seems to have gotten
a whole lot better.

424
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:12,583
Well, all right then.

425
00:18:12,666 --> 00:18:14,750
Just don't overdo it, 'kay?

426
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:31,041
[MIYABI]
Tor. Wait.

427
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:33,833
[TOR]
What's up?

428
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:35,333
[MIYABI]
I want to thank you,

429
00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:36,666
for everything.

430
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,750
'Cause, you know. If it
wasn't for your help.

431
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:40,833
I wouldn't be here now.

432
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:43,708
You've really made an
impression on me.

433
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:44,833
I have?

434
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:46,541
That's right.

435
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,166
So much.

436
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:50,625
That, I also...

437
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:53,958
Well, you see
the thing is, Tor...

438
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:01,541
I like you.

439
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:03,250
I really like you.

440
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:07,666
I have to admit
those outdoor baths

441
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:10,125
are quite relaxing and
aren't bad at all.

442
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:12,500
So you mean you're actually
enjoying student life.

443
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:15,500
What strange turn
of events led to this?

444
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:18,666
If my time at school leads to
me achieving Absolute Duo,

445
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:21,666
then I don't see any reason why
I shouldn't enjoy the ride.

446
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,958
Correct?
[ping]

447
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:27,166
Seven people brought together
with Absolute Duo at their core.

448
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:29,083
You're a member of Reign.

449
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:30,666
You don't need me
to explain that.

450
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,708
Do you, Blaze Diabolica?

451
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:34,541
Don't bandy that name about.

452
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:37,250
Or I'll make you
regret it if you do.

453
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:39,083
[LILITH] You're rather cold
to somebody who's

454
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:41,000
currently in Reign's sights.

455
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:42,208
[sighs]

456
00:19:42,291 --> 00:19:44,583
That older gentleman
must be in quite a bind.

457
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:46,333
I'm sure that he is.

458
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:47,583
And in fact,

459
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:49,500
he'll probably try
something tonight.

460
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:51,291
Well, if you're mistaken,

461
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:52,708
then it appears that
my coming here

462
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:55,000
will have all been for nothing.

463
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:57,291
I see, so then you're the bait?

464
00:19:57,375 --> 00:19:58,833
[SAKUYA]
Yes.

465
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:00,750
Just like these branch school
students that I've prepared

466
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:03,000
to serve as
sacrifices if need be.

467
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:04,583
Tor Kokonoe.

468
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:07,583
He even thanked me for giving
all those students another shot.

469
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:10,125
Not knowing my true
intentions for them, of course.

470
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:12,750
Hmph.

471
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:16,750
Miyabi.

472
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:19,541
I'm sure it seems kinda sudden.

473
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:21,791
You and I haven't known
each other for very long,

474
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:25,583
but you've always cheered me on
in the short time that we have.

475
00:20:25,666 --> 00:20:27,333
Your kind words have
given me so much

476
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:29,208
support and encouragement
that actually--

477
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:32,875
I love you!

478
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:35,083
Do you feel the same way?

479
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:36,958
If you do,

480
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:39,375
then would you please
be my boyfriend, Tor?

481
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:43,666
[TOR thinking]
Miyabi,

482
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:46,750
is in love with me?

483
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:49,125
But...

484
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:50,625
these hands of mine.

485
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:55,541
[gasps]

486
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:07,125
[breath quivering]

487
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:09,916
[YOUNG BOY]
Oh, Tor.

488
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,416
Another one dead
because you're too weak.

[TOR gasps]

490
00:21:18,416 --> 00:21:20,083
[TOR]
I'm sorry.

491
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:21,791
But I can't do that, Miyabi.

492
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:23,000
[gasps]

493
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:24,333
[TOR]
You see.

494
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:25,916
I'm weak.

495
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,375
That's why I can't.

496
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:33,291
Oh okay.

497
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:37,583
Um. Yeah sure,
that's no problem.

498
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:40,666
I understand, and I'm also

499
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:41,916
stupid.

500
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:46,500
I should have just kept quiet!

501
00:21:46,583 --> 00:21:47,666
[cries]

502
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:49,083
I'm sorry!

503
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:50,500
[TOR]
No, wait.

504
00:23:32,041 --> 00:23:33,291
[explosion]

505
00:23:33,375 --> 00:23:34,333
[gasps]

506
00:23:36,708 --> 00:23:38,958
What the?

508

[K]
Now, then, shall we begin?

509
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,875
The Rebels, our
god-slaying corps

510
00:23:50,958 --> 00:23:52,500
and the Exceeds.

511
00:23:52,583 --> 00:23:55,083
It's time to judge and
be judged in the Selection!

512
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:05,125
It's those armored guys
who butted in on our Survive.

513
00:24:05,208 --> 00:24:07,041
I never thought
we'd see them again.

514
00:24:07,125 --> 00:24:09,583
Tomoe. They seem tougher
than they were before.

515
00:24:09,666 --> 00:24:11,583
That's not a problem
'cause so are we!

516
00:24:11,666 --> 00:24:12,666
Let's go!

517
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:14,500
[JULIE]
Next time: "Rebels."

518
00:24:14,583 --> 00:24:16,541
Miyabi. Please be all right!
