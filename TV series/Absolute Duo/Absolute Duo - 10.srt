That is how things occurred.

329
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:21,791
Unless perhaps
I'm somehow mistaken?

330
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:29,750
It appears you still
wish to fulfill your ambitions

331
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:31,166
of days gone by.

332
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:33,500
Count me out since I have
no interest in the desires

333
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:35,000
of a pitiful old man.

334
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:44,083
[MASTER ARMORER laughs]

335
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:46,208
That's quite harsh!

336
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:49,541
It's been said your words are
steeped in poison, witch,

337
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:52,291
but I didn't know
they'd be so toxic.

338
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:53,333
And,

339
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:55,208
I won't stand for such rudeness,

340
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:57,958
or take petty insults such
as yours lightly, so.

341
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:01,333
How about we settle this?

342
00:19:01,416 --> 00:19:03,416
I suggest we do so
with a little game,

343
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,750
Miss Sakuya.

344
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:06,875
A game?

345
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:08,083
What kind?

346
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:09,666
One that's easy as pie.

347
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,000
The rules are very simple.

348
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:13,541
My Rebels will attack
this academy.

349
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:16,500
And in response, your
Exceeds will try to stop them.

350
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:20,750
And then, whoever wipes out
the other side first wins.

351
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:23,208
Why don't we call it
a killing game, yes?

352
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:32,791
I accept. Let's play.

353
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:34,958
Then it's decided.

354
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:35,916
[laughs]

355
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:39,208
Tor, um.

356
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:40,666
Absolute Duo.

357
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:43,375
To be honest with you,
I'm still not entirely certain

358
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:44,958
I understand
what it's all about.

359
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:49,583
But so many people, they end up
getting hurt in its pursuit.

360
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:51,833
[TOR thinking] It's true that I
did come to the Academy seeking

361
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:53,125
to get stronger.

362
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,583
But now,

363
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:57,958
I wonder,

364
00:19:58,041 --> 00:19:59,000
if I should.

365
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:00,666
Huh?

366
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,083
I guess,

367
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:05,208
it's like gaining one thing
while losing another.

368
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:07,291
But this is reality.
Get used to it.

369
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:11,958
Doesn't make it any less sad.

370
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,708
[TOR]
You and Sakuya may be right.

371
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:16,041
What?

372
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:17,458
What you've said.

373
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:20,291
I've actually been thinking
that you two may be right.

374
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:22,333
But I just

375
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:24,125
didn't want to admit it.

376
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,458
You silly man.

377
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:29,166
No, of course you wouldn't.

[ETHNARCH]
Wait, what?

381
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,166
A Rebel attack?

382
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:41,250
An attack?

383
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:42,833
It's happening in 10 minutes?

384
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:45,666
With all due respect, how do
you even know this, sir?

385
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,333
Did you say a killing game?

386
00:20:47,416 --> 00:20:49,291
Oh no, they're here!

387
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:59,666
Now it's time for
today's feast to begin!

388
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:02,958
Bring on the bacchanalia
of bloodshed!

389
00:22:44,541 --> 00:22:46,041
Thanks for the invitation.

390
00:22:46,125 --> 00:22:47,875
This should be a lot of fun.

391
00:22:47,958 --> 00:22:49,458
So this is a killing game?

You ready, Julie?

Ja.

I'm a whole lot stronger now.

What do you think, Tor?

[MIYABI]
I wanted to be stronger,

407
00:24:04,791 --> 00:24:07,208
so I could catch up to the rest.

408

So I could stand
before him, too.

409

And so I could
be true to myself.
