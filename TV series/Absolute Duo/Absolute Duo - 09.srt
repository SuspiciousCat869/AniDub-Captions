There's something different
about these guys now.

[TOMOE thinking]
Please be all right, Miyabi.

00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:52,000
I can say with
absolute certainty

15
00:02:52,083 --> 00:02:53,625
that this is Equipment
Smith's team.

These new Units,

they're not the same
as they were last time.

They're Rebels.

The so-called
"god-destroying corps".

20
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:04,250
It seems that they have
lived up to their name.

00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:07,916
[laughing] Well, if you ask me,
the name is super dramatic.

22
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,125
But that doesn't change
the fact that as we speak,

23
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,458
they're giving
our little Level 2's

24
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:13,000
a pretty serious spanking.

25

Luckily, there hasn't been
a single casualty reported.

He must not want any.

27

And in fact, knowing
what I do about him,

28
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,458
this is what that older
gentleman would

29
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:25,208
call a first-round Selection.

30

Only a barbarian

Well, Miss,
about that.

34
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:48,333
So the campus is being
attacked by another squadron?

Damn.

36
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:52,000
They want the underground
research facility.

Or so I assume.

38

I'm sorry.

This isn't your fault.

I will find Miyabi

She jumped in the way,
trying to protect us.

My mind was made up.

Wait, help who?

00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:55,375
Sakuya.

191
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:57,625
I'm ashamed to admit it, but,

192
00:10:57,708 --> 00:10:59,958
I failed and they took her.

193
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:02,416
Please find her
and bring her back.

194

Will you promise me
that you'll do that?

195
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:06,500
Yeah.

Ja.

You can admit it now.

Even so,
we made it.

[K] Why I do what
I do is my business.

It's of no concern to you.

208
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:57,541
[TOR] When you opened fire on my
friends, you made it my concern.

[K] You won't be concerned
with anything if I kill you.

Listen up.

Despite all appearances,
I can assure you

212
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:07,541
I'm a truly merciful man.

213
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:08,958
As such, I'll forgive
your interruption

if you jump off this boat
in the next five seconds.

I don't need five seconds.

I told Lilith I'd bring Sakuya
back and I'm a man of my word.

Sort of.

251

It might have been fatal
to someone else.

Such an attack has
no effect on me.

So that's the new Unit Equipment
Smith has been developing?

It appears to be quite powerful.

Just as you Exceeds

00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:02,541
[K]
Incredible.

335
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:04,791
You've been hiding all
that power this whole time?

336
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,208
[TOR]
You!

337
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:08,333
Do you actually expect me
to believe that you could

338
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:10,666
protect this girl considering
the shape you're in?

339
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,208
I do.

340
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:14,041
Because I'll do
whatever it takes

341
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:15,416
to keep all my friends safe!

342
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,375
Hearing you spout
nonsense like that,

343
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:20,250
it makes me sick.

344
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:22,791
Do you really think you're
good enough to protect her?

345
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:25,958
How could a broken-down runt
like you protect anybody?

346
00:18:26,041 --> 00:18:26,958
[gasps]

347
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:29,041
[growls]

348
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:31,041
[beeping]

349
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:32,833
Stand by a little longer.

350
00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:35,666
I have in my possession
the Blaze Diabolica, sir.

351
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,500
[MAN]
That won't be necessary.

352
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:39,583
As luck would have it,

353
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:41,958
we already have
what we came here for.

354
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:43,166
But.

355
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:45,833
[MAN] We must prepare
for another banquet.

356
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:48,875
I'm ordering you to
return immediately, K.

357
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:51,875
Understood, sir.

358
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:55,625
I never did catch your name.

359
00:18:58,333 --> 00:18:59,750
I'm Tor Kokonoe.

360
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:03,791
Nice to formally meet
you, Tor Kokonoe.

361
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:06,125
I'll kill you the next
time we cross paths.

362
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:08,583
I give you my word as a Rebel.

363
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:10,333
You can call me K.

364
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:13,666
Wait!

365
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:18,791
I'm going to remember that name.

366
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,166
You made it!

367
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:39,708
So Tor was able to
keep his promise, eh?

368
00:19:39,791 --> 00:19:41,750
Yes.

369
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:43,875
We must find a way to thank him.

370
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:46,625
Tell me.

371
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:49,958
Why would your captors
give you up so easily?

372
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:52,416
The answer to that
is elementary, my dear.

373
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:56,333
Obviously I was never the older
gentleman's intended target.

374
00:19:56,416 --> 00:19:57,916
Do you mean--

375
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,875
[phone ringing]

376
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:01,166
Yes, hello?

377
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:02,875
Fine, go ahead.

378
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:03,958
[gasps]

379
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:07,625
It's an invitation
to the Reign Conference.

380
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:09,125
Isn't it?

381
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:43,625
[JULIE]
Papa.

382
00:21:43,708 --> 00:21:46,708
He was the hero of Gimle.

383
00:21:46,791 --> 00:21:48,833
One winter night,

384
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:51,291
Papa went into battle,

385
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:52,875
and lost.

386
00:21:54,541 --> 00:21:55,833
To him.

387
00:21:58,458 --> 00:22:01,166
Papa was kind
and loving to the very end.

388
00:22:02,625 --> 00:22:05,541
He patted my head and smiled.

389
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:07,041
As if to say,

390
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:08,375
"I'm sorry."

391
00:22:11,625 --> 00:22:14,916
And then, the same man
who murdered my father,

392
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,666
he gave me the scar
that runs down my back.

393
00:22:20,208 --> 00:22:22,500
That's why I want to be strong.

394
00:22:22,583 --> 00:22:25,541
Strong enough to kill
that man for what he did.

395
00:22:25,625 --> 00:22:29,916
And strong enough to
avenge the death of my father.

396
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,208
That's the whole reason why I
came to study at Koryo Academy.

397
00:22:33,291 --> 00:22:36,708
That's why you said you're
an avenger like me?

398
00:22:36,791 --> 00:22:38,625
Ja.

399
00:22:38,708 --> 00:22:39,708
But Tor,

400
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:41,583
even so,

401
00:22:41,666 --> 00:22:44,333
you've still had to
protect me a lot.

402
00:22:44,416 --> 00:22:45,916
I'm so weak.

403
00:22:47,291 --> 00:22:49,166
No, you're not.

404
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:52,000
You've protected me.

405
00:22:52,083 --> 00:22:55,333
But you're the one who's always
working so hard to protect me.

406
00:22:55,416 --> 00:22:57,250
Well, yeah, of course.

407
00:22:57,333 --> 00:22:59,458
I am your partner after all.

408
00:22:59,541 --> 00:23:00,666
Ja.

409
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:02,916
That's right,
and I'm your partner.

410
00:23:04,291 --> 00:23:05,541
Mm.

411
00:23:07,916 --> 00:23:10,166
[TOR thinking] All I want
is to keep Julie safe,

412
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:12,291
so she'll never get
hurt like this again.

413
00:23:13,958 --> 00:23:15,791
And that's why

414
00:23:15,875 --> 00:23:17,666
I've got to get stronger.

415
00:23:25,583 --> 00:23:27,500
Will this thing really
make me stronger?

416
00:23:28,583 --> 00:23:29,916
Yes.

417
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,666
I think you'll find that
it's incredibly effective.

418
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:35,208
Especially for those who
know their own weaknesses.

419
00:23:36,625 --> 00:23:37,958
I guarantee it.

420
00:23:43,708 --> 00:23:44,833
[gasps]

421
00:23:44,916 --> 00:23:46,375
So what do you say?

422
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:49,416
Remember this is a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

423
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:54,166
A chance for you to grow
stronger in every possible way.

424
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:56,875
[MIYABI thinking]
If I were stronger,

425
00:23:56,958 --> 00:23:59,708
maybe Tor would...

426
00:24:02,291 --> 00:24:04,958
[TOR] I didn't have
the slightest idea.

427
00:24:05,041 --> 00:24:07,208
Not about why this
Academy was made,

428
00:24:07,291 --> 00:24:10,250
or about what this Academy
was actually making.

429
00:24:10,333 --> 00:24:11,708
None of it.

430
00:24:11,791 --> 00:24:14,000
[JULIE]
Next time: "Reign Conference."

431
00:24:15,041 --> 00:24:16,625
This is reality.
Get used to it.
