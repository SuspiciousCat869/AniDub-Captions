Tor.

332
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:09,083
Huh?

333
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:10,666
Here you go.

334
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,000
Is this all for me?

335
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:13,083
Don't be daft.

336
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:14,666
I'm asking you to
feed me because

337
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:17,458
both of my hands are occupied.

338
00:18:17,541 --> 00:18:18,666
Ahhhh.

339
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,041
That's right, say "ah."

340
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:23,333
This is actually pretty tasty.

341
00:18:23,416 --> 00:18:24,958
Wait, was there some
misunderstanding

342
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:26,666
because I remember
asking Tor to feed me.

343
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:27,791
Open up.

344
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:29,208
Say, "ah."

345
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:30,250
Ahh--

346
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:33,208
So good!

347
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:34,375
Stop doing that!

348
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:35,958
Are you even
listening to me?

349
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:38,375
[BOTH laughing]

350
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:45,583
Headmistress.

351
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:48,000
Look, I was wrong about you.

352
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:51,166
At first I thought you
were so coldhearted.

353
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:52,958
But I had no idea that
you planned to give

354
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:54,958
Imari and the others
another chance.

355
00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:56,916
I'm really grateful
to you for that.

356
00:18:58,416 --> 00:19:00,666
I just wanted to say thank you.

357
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:03,541
Then you still have some
misapprehension about me.

358
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:04,958
What?

359
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:06,791
I can assure you that
everything I do is in service of

360
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:09,833
finding the talent that
the Dorn Agency requires.

361
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:12,041
I have done nothing
to merit any thanks.

362
00:19:14,541 --> 00:19:16,291
Well, then, good evening.

363
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:17,750
Tor Kokonoe.

364
00:19:19,916 --> 00:19:23,250
I desire one thing
and one thing only.

365
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:24,958
That this path I'm on,

366
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:27,458
will one day lead me
to Absolute Duo.

367
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:35,125
[FEMALE STUDENT] The way you
fought back there was amazing!

368
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:36,416
[FEMALE STUDENT 2]
It's no wonder you

369
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,000
got into the main school!

370
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:40,000
I'm not that impressive.

371
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:41,625
You most certainly are!

372
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:44,375
Every day I find something
new to admire in you.

373
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:47,083
Um, Thanks a lot, Tomoe.

374
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:48,916
I'm going to go get some food!

375
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,083
[MIYABI gasps]
Huh?

376
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:56,583
Sorry 'bout that!

377
00:19:56,666 --> 00:19:58,583
No, please go ahead.

378
00:19:58,666 --> 00:20:00,416
So, you're the talk of
the training camp.

379
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,958
I heard about how bravely you
fought to save Tomoe earlier.

380
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:05,500
Well.

381
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:08,625
There was a point where my
instincts just took over.

382
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,750
And that was
mostly because you--

383
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,250
[gasps]

384
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:14,416
Huh?

385
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,666
What was that you
just said about me?

386
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,416
Uh.

387
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,333
It's nothing.

388
00:20:21,416 --> 00:20:23,166
Of course.

389
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:26,083
It's because Tor has been
there for me so many times...

390
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:29,125
that I feel...

391
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:32,208
I feel like...

392
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:33,875
Hey, Miyabi!

393
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:36,541
Tor, what are you
doing over there?

394
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:37,708
Coming!

395
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:39,291
Let's go!

396
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:40,458
'Kay!

397
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:45,750
[MIYABI thinking]
Now I know.

398
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:49,000
That what I'm
feeling for Tor is love.

399
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:50,583
True Love.

400
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:55,083
[MAN] The Unit is now
completely calibrated.

401
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:58,083
All that's left is to
move onto the final stage.

402
00:20:58,166 --> 00:21:00,125
But, of course,
in order to do that

403
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:02,166
I require one last component.

404
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:03,833
[loud chewing]

405
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,625
And you'd like me to obtain it.

406
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:13,666
Is that right?

407
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,250
[MAN]
Yes.

408
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:18,208
And there's no reason for you to
report this to the higher-ups.

409
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:19,875
They are just as
curious as we are

410
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:23,250
to find out how
powerful this thing is.

411
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:25,833
The test results should be more
than enough to satisfy them.

412
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:29,541
The test.

413
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:31,458
Assess and be assessed, is it?

414
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:35,416
And what will the
codename be this time?

415
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,500
[chuckles]

416
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:38,291
A competition.

417
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:40,125
Let's call it Selection.

418
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:41,291
What do you think?

419
00:21:46,416 --> 00:21:48,125
[sinister laugh]

420
00:23:21,125 --> 00:23:23,375
[grunting]

421
00:23:23,458 --> 00:23:25,291
That should do it.

422
00:23:25,375 --> 00:23:27,291
I need a favor that
might seem strange,

423
00:23:27,375 --> 00:23:28,875
but will actually help
us bunk together

424
00:23:28,958 --> 00:23:31,000
for the rest of our time
here at summer camp.

425
00:23:31,083 --> 00:23:32,708
Oh, yeah, sure.

426
00:23:32,791 --> 00:23:34,666
I'd be happy to help.

427
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:36,000
Ja.

428
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:39,083
About what happened today.

429
00:23:39,166 --> 00:23:40,291
I now know that it taught me

430
00:23:40,375 --> 00:23:42,333
a very important
lesson about life.

431
00:23:42,416 --> 00:23:45,583
An ounce of prevention's
worth a pound of cure.

432
00:23:45,666 --> 00:23:48,250
Please hang on to these
in case I need them?

433
00:23:48,333 --> 00:23:49,625
These?

434
00:23:52,375 --> 00:23:53,333
Tor.

435
00:23:53,416 --> 00:23:55,291
Is it necessary
to look at them?

436
00:23:55,375 --> 00:23:56,916
[sputtering]

437
00:23:58,458 --> 00:23:59,708
Sorry.

438
00:23:59,791 --> 00:24:01,333
"These" were not
what I was expecting.

439
00:24:03,666 --> 00:24:04,916
[IMARI]
It's summer!

440
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,750
[ALL]
Yeah!

441
00:24:06,833 --> 00:24:08,208
[IMARI]
Time for swimsuits!

442
00:24:08,291 --> 00:24:09,916
[ALL]
Yeah!

443
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,375
[IMARI]
And hot springs!

444
00:24:11,458 --> 00:24:12,458
[ALL]
Yeah!

445
00:24:13,583 --> 00:24:15,291
Next time, "Selection."

446
00:24:15,375 --> 00:24:16,958
Plus, a wardrobe malfunction!
