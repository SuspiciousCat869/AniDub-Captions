Are you sure you didn't mistake
what you saw?

I'm sure. Her Blaze
was definitely a rifle.

But, Tor, how can that be?

A Blaze can't manifest as any

Well, I guess it actually can

--An "Exception"?

Hm-mm. No, not really.

No. It's because

To Sublimate, your physical

have to match your new level,
so stop being so humble, okay?

You should

get exhausted easily.

161

In this case, it's way more
mental than physical,

Well, I should be!
Ever since I was really little,

my favorite hobbies have been
hunting and shooting.

Whoa, hunting and shooting, huh?

Well, that's pretty uncommon

You should learn and know
everything you can

about a weapon

especially if you'd entrust
your own life to it.

As a result of this,

184
00:12:11,916 --> 00:12:13,750
guns are the weapons
I'm most familiar with.

what was it
you wanted to ask me?

207
00:13:16,416 --> 00:13:18,291
[TOR] Well, why did
you use your Blaze

208
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:20,291
in front
of all those people yesterday?

209

[LILITH] Oh, that?
It's only natural

to use your Blaze
in front of your Duo partner.

Huh?

212

[LILITH] I was so excited
when I learned there was

213
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:36,250
another wielder
of an Unrivaled Blaze out there.

214
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:38,500
I felt like I was
the only one, Tor,

but then to hear
I wasn't alone--

00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:42,666
that was when I knew it.

217
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,500
That you, the Irregular,

218
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:47,125
could be the only
Duo partner for me.

219

I've already got a Duo partner,

that I'd stand by her always.

she really hates my guts.

to be her partner before,

and do your best, okay?

318
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:12,958
I hope my words
were encouraging!

319
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:15,041
No, they were anything but that!

320
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:16,583
And we don't need you to see

321
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:18,958
that these guys are gonna
give us a run for our money.

322
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:24,875
Even so, we're not inexperienced
fighters any more.

323
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:26,500
Ja. And not only that,

324
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:28,750
but all of us are
much stronger now, as well.

325
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:31,500
[humphs] I don't care if they
are stronger than us, Tatsu.

326
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:33,750
I can't wait
to take these bozos on!

327
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:34,708
[grunts]

328
00:20:34,791 --> 00:20:36,791
Um, am I the only here

329
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:38,625
who's really scared
about this fight?

330
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:42,208
Hey, don't worry, Miyabi.
This is gonna be a group effort.

331
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:44,708
We're all gonna pull together,
rely on each other,

332
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:47,583
and win this battle
as a unified class.

333
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:49,083
--[BOY] Who are you?
--[BOTH] Huh?

334
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:51,375
[STUDENTS gasp]

335
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:53,375
It's Lilith.

336
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:56,125
I hate to interrupt,
but might we please

337
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:58,625
get this Mordraco battle
started right away?

338
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:01,083
As the first year
student representative,

339
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:03,375
I'll be taking on
all of you alone.

340
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:05,666
No one fights
in the Mordraco alone.

341
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:07,500
You must be pulling
our legs, right?

342
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:09,916
Quit joking around
and just get off the field.

343
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,833
You don't believe me?

344
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:13,416
Let me prove it to you.

345
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,625
--[gunshot]
--[grunts]

346
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:17,583
[STUDENTS gasp]

347
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,666
[TOMOE]
Her Blaze is a rifle!

348
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:25,458
[gasps]

349
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:29,208
Well, now that that's sorted,
let's get started, shall we?

350
00:23:02,541 --> 00:23:03,666
--[gunshot]
--[grunts]

351
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:10,916
Lilith took all of 'em out.

352
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,625
[SAKUYA] My, this is a problem.

353
00:23:15,791 --> 00:23:18,416
I do realize that you're
an Exception, Lilith,

354
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,791
but now you've ruined the chance

355
00:23:19,875 --> 00:23:22,208
for our first year students
to test their strength.

356
00:23:22,291 --> 00:23:24,291
Oh, they'll still get
their chance.

357
00:23:24,375 --> 00:23:26,583
In fact, to allow them
the opportunity,

358
00:23:26,666 --> 00:23:29,583
I've decided to hold
a dance party for everyone.

359
00:23:29,666 --> 00:23:32,708
It will be a very different type
of party, however.

360
00:23:32,791 --> 00:23:34,208
We'll dress up in Blazes,

361
00:23:34,291 --> 00:23:36,041
the music will be
the clash of weapons,

362
00:23:36,125 --> 00:23:38,250
and as host,
I'll dance with everybody.

363
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:39,750
Hmm.

364
00:23:39,833 --> 00:23:41,458
Wow! So then
you're gonna take on

365
00:23:41,541 --> 00:23:43,583
all these first-year
kiddos alone?

366
00:23:43,666 --> 00:23:46,750
You sure are a feisty
little thing, Miss Priss!

367
00:23:46,833 --> 00:23:50,541
Now as for the theme
of our dance, let's think.

368
00:23:54,625 --> 00:23:56,875
[BOTH gasp]

369
00:23:56,958 --> 00:23:59,791
Yes, that's apropos.
It's "Survive."

370
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:05,500
Lilith is an Unrivaled,
and she's a crack shot

371
00:24:05,583 --> 00:24:09,500
with that rifle Blaze of hers.
We can't let our guard down.

372
00:24:09,583 --> 00:24:11,791
Ja. You're right.
And we won't lose!

373
00:24:11,875 --> 00:24:12,958
Julie?

374
00:24:13,041 --> 00:24:14,625
Next time, "Survive."

375
00:24:14,708 --> 00:24:17,208
Don't worry,
I've got your back, Tor.
