[TOR]
Lilith?

495
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:30,666
What does she have?

496
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:42,375
[CROWD]
Wait, were those gunshots?

497
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:43,916
Those guys are hurt.

498
00:21:47,791 --> 00:21:48,958
Hmm!

499
00:21:51,041 --> 00:21:55,041
An Exception with...
a rifle Blaze?

500
00:21:55,125 --> 00:21:56,291
Oh, man.

501
00:21:56,375 --> 00:21:57,750
That's nuts.

502
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,458
Uh... uh...

503
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,750
You know, Julie.

504
00:23:33,833 --> 00:23:35,458
It's such a coincidence
that you're shopping

505
00:23:35,541 --> 00:23:38,125
for underwear on the
same day as me and Miyabi.

506
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:40,166
So then, what do
you think about that bra?

507
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:41,583
How does it fit?

508
00:23:41,666 --> 00:23:44,458
It seems to be a little
too big here in the front.

509
00:23:44,541 --> 00:23:46,166
In that case, you
should get the one

510
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:48,333
that's sized
a little smaller. Okay?

511
00:23:48,416 --> 00:23:49,333
Yeah.

512
00:23:49,416 --> 00:23:50,708
I'll go do that right away.

513
00:23:50,791 --> 00:23:52,166
Yeah.

514
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:53,375
[gasping]

515
00:23:53,458 --> 00:23:55,291
[MIYABI]
Oh, Tor, how could you?

516
00:23:55,375 --> 00:23:57,958
[TOMOE]
You're a perv and a dog!

517
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:01,875
This is so unfair!

518
00:24:01,958 --> 00:24:03,250
Nice to meet you!

519
00:24:03,333 --> 00:24:04,625
I'm Lilith Bristol.

520
00:24:04,708 --> 00:24:06,208
[RITO]
Do it cuter!

521
00:24:06,291 --> 00:24:07,583
Hi, I'm Lilith!

522
00:24:07,666 --> 00:24:09,291
[MIYABI]
Um, what's that girl doing?

523
00:24:09,375 --> 00:24:10,291
[TOMOE]
Good question.

524
00:24:10,375 --> 00:24:12,125
[JULIE]
Next time: "Level Up."

525
00:24:12,208 --> 00:24:13,541
[RITO]
Now kick it up a notch!

526
00:24:13,625 --> 00:24:15,166
Lilith here!

527
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:16,583
Just what are you making me do?
