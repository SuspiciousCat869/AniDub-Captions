Remember?

167
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:41,583
When it was just
the two of us on the beach?

168
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:43,416
And then you told me
you were too weak.

169
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:46,291
That's why.

170
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:49,000
I decided then and there
I was going to get stronger.

171
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:51,250
That I wouldn't let
anything hurt you.

172
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:53,750
That's the only reason
I'm doing all of this.

173
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:56,916
I thought that if I could
protect you from everything,

174
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,166
maybe you'd love me.

175
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:01,166
And then, we could
be together, forever.

against Exceeds,

184
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:33,291
you took on an Exception.

But unfortunately for me,
playtime is just about over.

But I have other
matters to attend to.

I'm afraid I must
greet the Blaze Diabolica

make an excellent test subject.

I bid you adieu.

199

Hey, guys? Listen.

I'm gonna need you to let me

Yeah, I know what
it sounds like.

Come on. Let me go!

Listen.

00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:00,041
We should trust her,

and the bonds shared by a Duo.

away with this, Tomoe.

But this time,
I'll gladly do so.

this as an ad-hoc Duo?

threatened your precious Sakuya.

I only want one thing.

More than anything,

when the person you
swore to protect is dead!

And gone!

that your wishes

You left behind

and take on the Fusion?

Miyabi,

did you tell him how,

00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:28,208
Yes, I did.

And then,

336
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:30,666
he rejected me.

337
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:33,375
Because I was so weak.

Well, in that case,

I've never once been in love.

in all of that false power!

You were brave enough
to tell Tor how you felt,

stronger without that stuff!

to face Tor again!

Impossible!

494
00:21:47,625 --> 00:21:48,833
[grunts]

495
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:51,666
How could my Units have
been defeated like this?

496
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,208
[SAKUYA] It appears
as though this evening's

497
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:54,958
soiree has come to an end.

498
00:21:57,708 --> 00:21:59,250
What a farce this
turned out to be.

499
00:21:59,333 --> 00:22:02,125
[laughing] Well, I thought it
was extremely entertaining!

500
00:22:03,291 --> 00:22:04,416
Right.

501
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,375
See you at
the next conference.

502
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:08,875
Au revoir, everyone.

503
00:22:08,958 --> 00:22:10,333
What do you think now?

504
00:22:10,416 --> 00:22:11,791
Has this changed
your mind about what

505
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:14,416
you called "antiquated"
soul power?

506
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,500
If you still don't
understand it,

507
00:22:16,583 --> 00:22:19,250
perhaps it's time to
admit that it's beyond you.

508
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:20,750
[giggles]

509
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:23,208
[grunts]

510
00:22:23,291 --> 00:22:24,833
She's just a girl!

511
00:22:24,916 --> 00:22:27,958
I can understand how I lost
to her grandfather years ago

512
00:22:28,041 --> 00:22:30,208
but losing to a giggling child?

513
00:22:31,708 --> 00:22:33,375
[SAKUYA]
Tor Kokonoe.

514
00:22:33,458 --> 00:22:36,125
Will you live up to all
my expectations?

515
00:22:36,208 --> 00:22:37,708
I hope so.

516
00:22:42,041 --> 00:22:44,041
[K thinking]
I-- I lost?

517
00:22:44,125 --> 00:22:45,875
To that weakling?

518
00:22:45,958 --> 00:22:47,708
But how?

519
00:22:47,791 --> 00:22:49,375
[grunts]

520
00:22:49,458 --> 00:22:51,791
[MASTER ARMORER]
K, you pathetic worthless stray!

521
00:22:51,875 --> 00:22:53,375
How dare you let
that brat of a girl

522
00:22:53,458 --> 00:22:54,958
make a fool out
of me like that?

523
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:58,708
This is all your fault,
imbecile, do you hear me, yours!

524
00:22:58,791 --> 00:23:00,125
[grunting]

525
00:23:00,208 --> 00:23:01,916
[MASTER ARMORER] Have
you forgotten the generosity

526
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,916
and the kindness
that I showed to you?

527
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,250
Scum like you doesn't
even deserve to live!

528
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:10,375
[laughing]

529
00:23:10,458 --> 00:23:11,375
Huh?

530
00:23:11,458 --> 00:23:14,500
You actually find this funny?

531
00:23:14,583 --> 00:23:17,041
I guess there's only one
course of action left to take.

532
00:23:17,125 --> 00:23:18,666
[laughs]

533
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:20,791
Now go forth and
destroy everything!

534
00:23:20,875 --> 00:23:22,875
Kill the girl
and burn down the school!

535
00:23:24,666 --> 00:23:26,000
[groans]

536
00:23:26,083 --> 00:23:28,750
You-- you bastard.

537
00:23:28,833 --> 00:23:30,166
I see now

538
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:32,625
that the only person you
can trust is yourself.

539
00:23:32,708 --> 00:23:34,000
[groans]

540
00:23:35,541 --> 00:23:36,583
Help me.

541
00:23:36,666 --> 00:23:38,125
No one can hear you.

542
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:40,458
No one will come to
protect you, old man.

543
00:23:40,541 --> 00:23:42,041
Ugh!

544
00:23:42,125 --> 00:23:45,541
Having a stingy old crank like
you around might ruin my plans.

545
00:23:45,625 --> 00:23:47,125
And now,

546
00:23:47,208 --> 00:23:48,833
this is mine.

547
00:23:53,583 --> 00:23:55,583
I have the ultimate armor.

548
00:23:55,666 --> 00:23:57,708
Destruction!

549
00:23:57,791 --> 00:23:59,208
And I will use it

550
00:23:59,291 --> 00:24:02,583
to destroy Kokonoe
and his friends!

551
00:24:02,666 --> 00:24:03,958
[TOR]
I've always wondered.

552
00:24:04,041 --> 00:24:06,625
Why does my soul-power
take the form of a shield?

553
00:24:06,708 --> 00:24:10,208
Well now I finally
know the answer.

554
00:24:10,291 --> 00:24:11,708
And it's because of you.

555
00:24:11,791 --> 00:24:14,625
[JULIE] Next time,
the finale: "Absolute Duo."

556
00:24:14,708 --> 00:24:17,083
[BOTH]
Head off the fang! Aegis Desire!
