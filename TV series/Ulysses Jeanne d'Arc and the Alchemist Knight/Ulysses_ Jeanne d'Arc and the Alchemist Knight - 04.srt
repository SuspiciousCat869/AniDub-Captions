[NARRATOR] The English army
continued their advance.

00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,708
In an effort to halt
their progress,

3
00:00:13,791 --> 00:00:15,625
the exiled French court
at Chinon

4
00:00:15,708 --> 00:00:17,500
attempted to enter
into peace talks

5
00:00:17,583 --> 00:00:19,500
with the leadership
of Burgundy.

6
00:00:19,583 --> 00:00:21,791
However, soon it all changed.

7
00:00:21,875 --> 00:00:24,416
Duke John I of Burgundy
was brutally murdered

8
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,208
during negotiations with one
of the more radical factions

9
00:00:27,291 --> 00:00:29,291
of the French royal family.

10
00:00:29,375 --> 00:00:32,250
With that, the relationship
between the two nations

11

became irreparable.

12
00:00:34,416 --> 00:00:36,208
Upon Duke John's death,

13
00:00:36,291 --> 00:00:39,166
Philip the Good
ascended to rule over Burgundy.

14

I may as well tell you,

I'd like you to tell me

You have to kiss him
to obtain the elixir.

It flows straight from his lips,

so there's no other way
to get it.

But you deserve this treatment,
dear cousin.

83
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:03,041
The French royal family
will not achieve supremacy

84
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:04,958
through war mongering
or strategy.

85
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:06,583
But through politics,

86
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:08,041
we shall relinquish
the French throne

87
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:09,541
and cede
Northern France to England,

88
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:11,291
as we've lost both already.

89

In exchange, we will secure
territorial rights

to the land south of the Loire.

and acquiring a new title,

"Royal Family
of Southern France."

unless we make peace
with England.

sadly no longer exists.
