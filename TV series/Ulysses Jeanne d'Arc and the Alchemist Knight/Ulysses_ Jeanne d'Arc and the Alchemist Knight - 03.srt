[NARRATOR]
As the English army advanced,

2
00:00:10,208 --> 00:00:12,750
the French royal court
escaped Paris

3
00:00:12,833 --> 00:00:16,333
and relocated their palace
to Chinon, in the southwest.

4
00:00:16,416 --> 00:00:19,708
When the king of France died,
a successor had to be crowned.

5
00:00:19,791 --> 00:00:22,666
But his male descendants
had all perished in battle.

6
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:26,208
As a result, a female heir
ascended to the throne.

7
00:00:26,291 --> 00:00:29,333
Princess Charlotte now sits
at the head of the royal court,

8
00:00:29,416 --> 00:00:31,458
frightened,
and unprepared to rule.

9
00:00:33,291 --> 00:00:34,750
With immense responsibility

10
00:00:34,833 --> 00:00:37,416
and crushing loneliness
weighing on her heart,

11
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,708
Charlotte calls out a name,
that of an old friend

12
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:43,916
with whom she'd shared
a promise years before.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,541

saved by a brave young woman."

17
00:02:31,541 --> 00:02:33,875
At least, that's the rumor
spreading throughout the land.

18
00:02:33,958 --> 00:02:37,500
It's the talk of Paris,
Reims, Rouen,

19
00:02:37,583 --> 00:02:40,958
and every other city and hamlet
from Flanders to Gascony.

20
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:42,875
Has this town heard the news?

21

just fleeting gossip.

Truth be told,
it's just a rumor.

24
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,333
But a story like that
has only caught on

25
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:54,916
because the people of
this country want to believe it.

That the only ones capable
of ending this awful war,

to the task by God himself.

Fear not.

God has not yet
abandoned France.

30
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:08,625
The Archangel Michael
descended from heaven

to save us.
