00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,875
My heart is spoken,
for it belongs to Alencon

167
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:25,708
and no one besides him
shall ever lay hands on my body!

168
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,708
[WOMAN 1] Do you dress this way
just to tempt him?

169
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:29,875
[WOMAN 2] How romantic.
That's what I call true love!

170
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:32,041
Please, ladies,
don't misunderstand!

171
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:33,458
[BATARD]
Save me, my hero!

172
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:35,125
[ALENCON yelling]

173
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:37,125
Breasts and ale!

174
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:38,875
I can't believe my luck.

175
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:40,833
Before this, we mercenaries
were thought of

176
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:42,875
as annoyances at the very best,

177
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:45,166
but now I couldn't pay women
to stay away!

178
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:47,625
Well, good for you.

179
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:48,958
You'd better get laid
while the sun shines,

180
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:50,458
or however the saying goes.

181
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:52,458
[XAINTRAILLES] Now, hold on,
woman, make no mistake!

182
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:55,750
You shall always be number one
in my heart, Etienne.

183
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:57,666
I'll even forget about
that little dalliance

184
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,416
you had with Montmorency.

185
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,500
Come on, why not spend the night
with me, my love?

186
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:04,375
Aren't you getting full?

187
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,250
[LA HIRE]
I've been ravenously hungry

188
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,916
ever since I became Ulysses.

189
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,208
I usually carry all my excess
weight in my breasts,

190
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:13,041
but even that has a limit.

191
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:15,041
This must be a side effect
of Joyeuse.

192
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:17,000
Dammit, Montmorency,
where are you?!

193
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:18,791
I need to know
what's happening to me!

194
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:21,791
Are you trying to turn me
into a gluttonous pig or what?!

195
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:25,375
[JEANNE growls]

196
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:26,916
[MONTMORENCY]
I didn't have a choice.

197
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,750
The Philosopher's Stone
would have killed La Hire

198
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:30,250
if I hadn't given her
some elixir

199
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:32,375
-at that exact moment.
-[JEANNE growls]

200
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:34,333
It was simply a replenishment
of her elixir.

201
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:36,041
It meant nothing more to me
than that.

202
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:37,708
Please try to understand.

203
00:11:39,041 --> 00:11:40,333
-[JEANNE] Oh, I get it.
-[sighs]

204
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:43,250
[JEANNE] You want La Hire
to be your second wife,

205
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:44,916
‘cause you don't think
one is enough.

206
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,291
No!

207
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:47,916
See, you don't
understand at all.

208
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,916
Like I've told you
countless times before,

209
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,083
I only married Catherine
as a political move.

210
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:54,083
It isn't a marriage
born out of love!

211
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:55,708
[whines]

212
00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:59,458
[grunts] Is that behavior
becoming of a saint?

213
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:00,750
[CHARLOTTE panting]

214
00:12:03,125 --> 00:12:04,250
[CHARLOTTE]
Jeanne!

215
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:09,500
I feared I'd seen
the last of you!

216
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:14,000
I promise,
I shall never leave you again.

217
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:16,083
[JEANNE muffled] You're hugging
the life out of me.

218
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:17,833
I can't breathe!

This feels so embarrassing!

00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:28,333
[CHARLOTTE]
Understood.

223
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:30,708
I'll just kiss you
on the belly, then.

224
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:31,791
Oh, my!

225
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:33,583
It's such an adorable belly.

I just can't help myself.

Please let me go.

[MONTMORENCY]
Whatever happens,

231
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:42,791
we mustn't let the nobles
see them like this.

[JEANNE gasps]

233

the depth of my gratitude to you

00:12:50,541 --> 00:12:52,250
for saving Jeanne
and Montmorency.

[scoffs]

I would have preferred
huge tracts of land

to a medal any day.

[MONTMORENCY]
Yes?

00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:02,041
I hereby bestow upon you
the illustrious title

241
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:03,541
of general of the French army.

242
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:05,333
[MONTMORENCY]
Huh? Me?

243
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:07,083
I'm content to stay
an alchemist,

244
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:08,416
if it's all the same to you.

245
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,250
No, it, isn't, in fact.

246
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:13,250
To tell you the truth,
the fight is far from over.

247
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:15,458
The nobles in the palace
have yet to be united,

248
00:13:15,541 --> 00:13:17,083
and I must remain vigilant.

249
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:19,916
No doubt they will continue
to conspire against Jeanne.

250
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,583
I give you this title
to protect her.

Montmorency, from today forward

00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:27,583
you are the highest ranking

[sighs]

255
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:33,583
I'll take it,
but only on one condition.

256
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:36,708
That you will do your best
to reconcile with Richemont.

257
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:39,041
Of course I will.

258
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:40,625
I've been practicing my speech

259
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:42,916
in which I beg her to forgive me
for weeks on end now!

[ASTAROTH grunting]

[grunts]

262
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:00,000
[MONTMORENCY]
What do you think you're doing?

263
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:05,000
How could you leave
without telling me?

264
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:08,000
How dare you imply I need
your permission to leave?

265
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:10,541
You're the guardian of
the Philosopher Stones.

266
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:13,000
Would you really just
abandon them like this?

267
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:15,250
I am no longer fit
to do the job.

268
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:17,625
I couldn't even foresee
a major event

269
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:20,083
like the opening
of Babylon's Hole.

270
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:22,541
I almost allowed you and Jeanne
to be killed.

271
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:24,625
I was completely helpless.

272
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:27,541
You managed to open the path
to the future on your own,

273
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:28,791
no thanks to me.

274
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:32,000
This realm
doesn't need me anymore.

275
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:35,000
I am worthless to the cause,
so why shouldn't I leave?

276
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:37,666
[MONTMORENCY] What's the matter?
This isn't like you at all.

277
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:40,875
The Astaroth I know and love
calls me useless, not herself.

278
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:42,500
[chuckles]

279
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:45,000
How do you not see how utterly
pathetic my existence is?!

280
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:46,875
You're far dumber
than I ever imagined!

281
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:49,666
I had the audacity to demand
you create a utopia

282
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,541
within moments of meeting you,

283
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:54,500
and I knew all about Enlil
and Babylon's Hole, too.

284
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:56,791
But you weren't even
a little suspicious?

285
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:58,708
Moron. You're pathetic!

286
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:01,875
[MONTMORENCY]
Listen, Astaroth.

287
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:04,375
No matter how well
I might master alchemy,

288
00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:07,916
time cannot ever be regained
once it has passed.

289
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,041
In the end, the past is nothing
but an illusion.

290
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:13,458
The present is
all that really exists.

291
00:15:13,541 --> 00:15:16,083
The future's
not real yet, either.

292
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:17,458
Montmorency.

293
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:21,041
[ASTAROTH]
I stopped time for you

294
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:22,875
when you were nothing
more than a child.

295
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:26,875
But then, Jeanne must have
done something to help you grow

296
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:28,500
in spite of lost time.

297
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:32,041
-I wonder...
-Hmm?

298
00:15:33,208 --> 00:15:35,875
Will you allow me
to stay here with you?

299
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:38,708
I wanna watch you
and Jeanne make history.

300
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:41,833
Even though I feel like
I've let you both down.

301
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:44,166
[MONTMORENCY] Of course,
and you haven't let us down.

302
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,875
You can have a front-row seat.

303
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,375
Also, I've been wondering.

304
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:50,875
Remember that illusion
you showed me

305
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:52,083
of the beautiful woman?

306
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:53,208
Who was she?

307
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:54,541
[ASTAROTH]
Oh, that's right.

308
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:57,041
That was Venus,
the goddess of love and war,

309
00:15:57,125 --> 00:15:59,166
and she's always
right beside you.

310
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:02,291
[MONTMORENCY] Hmm?
So what is she to you, then?

311
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:04,458
Oh. Is she your sister
or something?

312
00:16:04,541 --> 00:16:06,250
[ASTAROTH]
Still an idiot.

313
00:16:09,791 --> 00:16:12,250
72 demons
that came to this world

314
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:13,791
from an alternate dimension?

315
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:16,541
Well, I wonder if their
sudden incursion

316
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:18,125
could somehow be related
to the legend

317
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:20,458
of the illustrious King Solomon.

318
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:21,791
No matter.

319
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:23,708
They've all been
vanquished, right?

320
00:16:23,791 --> 00:16:25,875
I honestly have no idea.

321
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:28,416
Gods and demons are not
