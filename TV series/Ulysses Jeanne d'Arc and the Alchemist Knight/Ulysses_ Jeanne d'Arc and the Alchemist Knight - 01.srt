00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:53,833
which you hold in your hand
like some cheap trinket.

488
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:57,083
[grunts]

489
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:01,666
[ASTAROTH]
But take care, Montmorency,

490
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,500
do not act rashly.

491
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:05,333
If you swallow
the Philosopher's Stone

492
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:06,791
in its current form,

493
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:09,791
it will turn to
a lethal poison and kill you.

494
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:11,625
You must first
transmute the stone

495
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:13,250
into a singular liquid,

496
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:15,833
known to the initiated
as "Elixir."

497
00:21:15,916 --> 00:21:17,416
After you drink it,

498
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:20,041
your body will be able
to withstand the poison.

499
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:26,041
[grunting]

500
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,541
Ah! Damn it.

501
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:35,625
Nothing I do
seems to be working.

502
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:38,333
Well, you've no real talent.

503
00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:39,541
[MONTMORENCY]
Shut up.

504
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:42,250
[MONTMORENCY sighs]

505
00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:44,208
How long have I been
at this now?

506
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:45,875
Seven years.

507
00:21:45,958 --> 00:21:47,000
What?

508
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,875
Uh...

509
00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:53,916
[sighs]

510
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,500
[MAN]
Small breasts are perilous.

511
00:23:29,583 --> 00:23:31,750
Should you become entranced
by them, it's over!

512
00:23:31,833 --> 00:23:33,250
And you're not
the kind of sickos

513
00:23:33,333 --> 00:23:35,541
who would lust after
the flat chests of little girls?

514
00:23:35,625 --> 00:23:36,583
Well, are you?

515
00:23:36,666 --> 00:23:38,166
Episode two.

516
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,791
"The Girl Called Jeanne."
I needn't worry about you lot.

517
00:23:40,875 --> 00:23:41,875
Right?

518
00:23:43,875 --> 00:23:46,291
[MAN 2]
Encore en rut, tel un animal.
