1
00:00:19,666 --> 00:00:22,416
[KAHO] I didn't get very
much sleep last night.

2
00:00:26,583 --> 00:00:28,958
[KAHO]
I had my first kiss.

3
00:00:29,041 --> 00:00:31,291
No rest for the wicked, I guess.

4
00:00:31,375 --> 00:00:32,291
You're up!

5
00:00:32,375 --> 00:00:33,291
Morning, Miss Nikaido!

6
00:00:33,375 --> 00:00:34,291
[KAHO squeals]

7
00:00:34,375 --> 00:00:35,875
Good! Yes, I'm up.
Good morning!

8
00:00:35,958 --> 00:00:38,250
The other kids sleep
in when there's no school.

9
00:00:38,333 --> 00:00:40,375
Lucky for you, I made
breakfast anyway.

10
00:00:40,458 --> 00:00:41,625
Eat as much as you like.

11
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:43,375
Oh, thank you.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,875
[KAHO] I guess that means
Kanade's still sleeping, too.

13
00:00:51,458 --> 00:00:53,125
--Good morning.
--Jeez, Kanade!

14
00:00:53,208 --> 00:00:54,875
You scared me again!

15
00:00:54,958 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm sorry.

16
00:00:56,083 --> 00:00:58,000
But I just can't
take it anymore.

17
00:00:58,083 --> 00:01:01,458
Uh... Take what anymore?

18
00:01:01,541 --> 00:01:03,500
[KAHO]
No. We can't!

19
00:01:03,583 --> 00:01:06,125
This is it. I'm dead!

20
00:01:06,208 --> 00:01:09,166
He'll never find out
if we don't tell him.

21
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:11,666
[KAHO]
Oh, no! Is he serious?

22
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:13,916
You don't mind. Do you?

23
00:01:18,416 --> 00:01:20,583
Gimme your seaweed.

24
00:01:20,666 --> 00:01:21,875
All yours.

25
00:01:21,958 --> 00:01:24,000
[KANADE] Yeah, seaweed!
I love seaweed!

26
00:01:24,083 --> 00:01:26,208
[KAHO]
Yup, that's my boyfriend.

27
00:01:26,291 --> 00:01:27,458
He's a fifth grader.

28
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:03,208
Good grief.
It's too early to be this tired.

29
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:04,958
[GIN, TOM]
Hello, Jell-o!

30
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:11,333
I'm sorry to descend on
you in a group like this.

31
00:03:11,416 --> 00:03:13,583
I had planned to
come alone, but then...

32
00:03:15,291 --> 00:03:16,625
We thought it sounded fun!

33
00:03:16,708 --> 00:03:19,625
Provided you boys
don't butt in, it's fine.

34
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:20,750
Hey, you guys.

35
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:22,416
Did we have plans
today or something?

36
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,625
[KAZ] Actually, I have
some business with Kaho.

37
00:03:24,708 --> 00:03:26,333
What? With me?

38
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:28,041
Rather than loitering here,

39
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:30,625
I think it best if we
repair to Kanade's room.

40
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:32,250
Wait, why in my room?

41
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:35,375
It's unbecoming.

42
00:03:35,458 --> 00:03:37,208
Men shouldn't intrude
into the private room

43
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:38,708
of an unmarried girl.

44
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:40,041
[KAHO]
Such a gentleman!

45
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:44,375
[KAHO] I know it's
not much, but here.

46
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:50,083
[KAHO]
I'm so intimidated.

47
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:52,375
Feels like I'm dealing
with my mother-in-law.

48
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,333
So you're admitting it, then?!

49
00:03:58,416 --> 00:03:59,625
You serve bad tea!

50
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:01,500
Why, you're just a demon-in-law!

51
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:03,166
Argh! I hate you!

52
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:05,833
I'm sorry, Mother!
Please forgive me!

53
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:08,750
[KAZ]
You're too modest.

54
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:10,750
This tea is terribly delicious.

55
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:13,625
[KAHO]
A sublime gentleman!

56
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:15,125
[KAZ]
Now, then...

57
00:04:15,208 --> 00:04:17,250
Let me say this once more.

58
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:20,750
I am very much against
you and Kanade dating.

59
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:23,541
Allow me to cut
to the chase here.

60
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:26,250
Tell me what exactly
it is you like about him.

61
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:30,583
Is it his face? His style?
His immature behavior?

62
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:31,666
[KAHO]
Well, I...

63
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:32,958
[KAZ] Perhaps because
he rescued you,

64
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:35,708
you think he's your
knight in shining armor?

65
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:36,833
Oh, I know.

66
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:38,833
You believe fate
put you together.

67
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:45,916
[KAZ] There is no deeper meaning
to Kanade's words or actions.

68
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,291
Observe.

69
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:49,916
Enter! Fall into my embrace
and drift back to sleep!

70
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,500
Whoa! It's the
Futonagon monster!

71
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:54,500
It's gonna try to eat us now!

72
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:56,333
Think again!

73
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:58,916
He's a much bigger fool
than you can imagine.

74
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,291
[KAHO]
Unexpectedly persuasive.

75
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:03,250
In short, you don't
know Kanade well enough

76
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:05,000
to have feelings for him.

77
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:07,458
And that's why I'm against
the two of you dating.

78
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:13,625
[KAZ] Kanade lost his
mother two years ago.

79
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:15,291
The pain he's
enduring from that loss

80
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:18,666
has driven him to seek
solace from an older woman.

81
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:21,541
And you are that older woman.

82
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:23,041
[KAHO]
What do I say?

83
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:24,833
He's got a good point.

84
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:26,916
You know what this
sounds like to me?

85
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,958
Someone is packed
full of bologna!

86
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,208
--Kanade!
--Dude...

87
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:33,291
She doesn't look like my mom.

88
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:35,333
That's what bothers you?

89
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:37,958
[KAZ] All right, so what
do you like about Kaho?

90
00:05:39,541 --> 00:05:41,000
I dunno.

91
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:42,708
Exactly.

92
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:45,708
Because you also know nothing
about her. Therefore--

93
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:47,416
[KANADE]
What's it matter, though?

94
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,041
What does what matter?

95
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:50,375
[KANADE] You don't fall
in love with someone

96
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:52,750
because you "know them."

97
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:54,958
Love is about wanting
to know more,

98
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:56,416
and then learning more.

99
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,041
That's really sweet.

100
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:02,583
[KAZ sighs]

101
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:05,000
Gin, Tom, let's go.

102
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:06,708
What? We just got here!

103
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:09,041
I wanted to soak up the
mysterious naughtiness

104
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:11,166
of being wrapped up
in another family's futon

105
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,166
for a little longer. Gah.

106
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:18,500
[KAZ] Kaho, I'm still against
you two being together.

107
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:26,000
Thank you. That was sweet.
I mean it.

108
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:27,208
No big deal.

109
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:28,875
But it makes me wonder...

110
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:30,458
You want to know
more, don't you?

111
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:32,041
About me?

112
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:33,625
Oh. Sure.

113
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:34,833
[KANADE]
All right.

114
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:37,666
Then come here.
I'll teach you all about me.

115
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:44,625
[KANADE] I'll show you things
even my father doesn't know.

116
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:48,791
Show me things even...
and on your bed?

117
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:50,833
No! Inappropriate! We can't!

118
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:52,333
I mean, you're in
elementary school,

119
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:54,166
and beyond that I... you... we--

120
00:06:58,208 --> 00:07:00,750
[KANADE] Secrets and risk
go hand in hand.

121
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:03,750
That's what growing up
is all about, Kaho.

122
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:05,500
[KAHO]
So close...

123
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:08,250
This bad idea just
keeps getting worse!

124
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:12,833
[KANADE] Just a sec,
I hid it under my pillow.

125
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:14,208
[KAHO]
Sorry, what?

126
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:20,541
[KANADE] If I'm gonna
teach you about me,

127
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:22,208
I figured the best way
would be to show you

128
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:24,291
what I can do like
super-duper good.

129
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:25,291
[KAHO]
Oh, yeah.

130
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:26,708
Look at those math scores.

131
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:27,750
[KANADE]
Right?

132
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:28,916
[SHUGO]
Kanade!

133
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,750
How about some snacks
for your friends?

134
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,041
What do you think
you're doing?

135
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:37,250
Um... This isn't how it looks!

136
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:45,041
Have you been
hiding these from me?

137
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:46,583
What do you have
to say for yourself?

138
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:47,666
Seriously?

139
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:52,875
Okay, I'm sorry.

140
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:55,458
[KAHO] Why am I kneeling
down like this, too?

141
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:57,291
Hiding poor test
scores from me like this

142
00:07:57,375 --> 00:07:58,375
is serious business.

143
00:07:58,458 --> 00:08:00,541
You shouldn't be
hiding anything from me.

144
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:02,541
Please kill me.

145
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:05,291
[SHUGO] I'm not going to kill
you over something like this.

146
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:07,958
I know. I want to take
responsibility, though.

147
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:09,916
I should own the
mistakes I make.

148
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:14,041
That's what your
mom always said.

149
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:17,583
[SHUGO sighs]

150
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:19,833
I dunno, maybe I'll
just get you a tutor.

151
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:22,416
No way! That sucks!
I don't want a stupid tutor!

152
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,875
[KAHO] He's pouting.
Like genuinely pouting.

153
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:26,916
How do you ever expect
to face your mother in heaven

154
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,750
when you've got
grades like this?

155
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:34,541
[KANADE]
Oh, no!

156
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:36,125
[exhaling]

157
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:38,458
I can't snot 'em out! I'm gonna
have a peanut tree in my nose!

158
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:43,000
Never mind. That was
a close one, though.

159
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:44,875
[KAHO]
Um, Kanade,

160

00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:08,625
Someone, help!

318
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,500
[KOTA]
What's going on out--[gasps]

319
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:13,125
[CHIAKI]
Why is there screaming?

320
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:21,541
[growling]

321
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:22,541
[KAHO screams]

322
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:23,875
[KOTA]
I'll protect you!

323
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:27,708
[CHIAKI] She used his face
as a springboard!

324
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:29,083
[KAHO screams]

325
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:31,125
[KOTA]
Run away!

326
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:32,666
[KAHO]
Shinohara, no!

327
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:38,083
[MAFUYU]
Wait!

328
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:44,208
[KAHO crying]

329
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:46,208
[KAHO]
How did I even get here?

330
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:53,916
[laughing maniacally]

331
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,333
[MAFUYU]
Don't move a muscle!

332
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:58,291
I have so much to
teach the new girl!

333
00:16:58,375 --> 00:17:00,708
I'm fine! Thank you
for the offer, though!

334
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:03,083
[MAFUYU] Why, you're
practically quivering, Dearie.

335
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:04,416
Oh, it's all right.

336
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:08,083
You don't need
to be afraid of me!

337
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:11,125
[grunting]

338
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:36,041
[KAHO]
Surely I'll be okay in here.

339
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:37,166
[door opens]

340
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:51,750
[door closes]

341
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,750
[MAFUYU]
I found you.

342
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:08,166
[screaming]

343
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:12,875
I swear I won't say anything!
Please don't hurt me!

344
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:15,000
[MAFUYU laughing]

345
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:16,041
[ARASHI]
Heads up, Kaho!

346
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:17,750
[CHIAKI]
Hi-yah!

347
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,041
They're mine!

348
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:23,041
Almost didn't make it this time.

349
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:25,916
You're not hurt,
are you, Kaho?

350
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,416
No, I'm fine.

351
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:30,625
[MAFUYU growling]

352
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:32,041
[KAHO]
Oh, my God!

353
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:34,125
She's eating the underwear!

354
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:37,791
[music playing]

355
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:41,166
Now calm down, Mafuyu.

356
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,791
That is unless you
haven't had enough.

357
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:46,041
Done. I ate them all.

358
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:49,791
Whoo, my tummy's full.

359
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:50,875
[giggles]

360
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:54,375
What in the world...?

361
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:56,666
All right, we're out.
You're on your own now.

362
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:59,291
[ARASHI]
See you, Mafuyu. Bye, Kaho.

363
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:08,500
When you saw me before,
what did you think?

364
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:10,500
[KAHO]
I'm so, so sorry.

365
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:12,708
I don't want you to apologize.

366
00:19:12,791 --> 00:19:14,375
I want to know what you thought.

367
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:18,625
What's wrong with
smelling the musk

368
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:20,583
of someone you love?

369
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:22,583
Scent synchronicity is science.

370
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:24,416
It unequivocally proves
that you're compatible

371
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,583
with each other.

372
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:27,041
It's natural.

373
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:29,875
And yet another reason Shugo
and I should get married.

374
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:31,375
Did you say Shugo?

375
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:35,583
[MAFUYU] I told you, I'm after
Kanade's family, not him.

376
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:38,958
[KAHO]
You mean you like his father?

377
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:40,291
Wow.

378
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:43,125
Um, but isn't he a lot--
like a lot older than you?

379
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:44,333
[MAFUYU]
Why?

380
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:45,875
Don't tell me you've got
a problem with that.

381
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:47,708
You're hardly in any
position to find fault

382
00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:49,291
with someone
else's relationship.

383
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:50,916
Who's the major perv
that's dating a kid

384
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,500
in elementary school?

385
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:54,541
[MAFUYU]
Tell me, freak.

386
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:56,375
What is it about Kanade, anyway?

387
00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:57,833
His face? His body?

388
00:19:57,916 --> 00:19:59,375
C'mon, out with it!

389
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:01,875
No, it's not about that!

390
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:04,416
This all started because
Kanade was the first person

391
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,291
to ever get really mad at me.

392
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:08,083
[MAFUYU]
Who cares, idiot?

393
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:09,750
How true can that be, anyway?

394
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:11,833
Since I'm way beyond
mad at you right now,

395
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:13,750
does that mean
you're falling for me?

396
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:16,416
[KAHO] Well, I never
said it was logical.

397
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,083
No worries!

398
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:21,458
Do you mind doing a favor
for me? Your new bestie?

399
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:23,208
First, this is our secret.

400
00:20:23,291 --> 00:20:25,208
Tell no one, and...

401
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:27,750
...second, take these
back where they belong.

402
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:33,000
[KAHO]
My life is so weird right now.

403
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:39,583
But on the bright side,
at least Mafuyu's not my enemy.

404
00:20:39,666 --> 00:20:41,833
Whatcha smiling about, Kaho?

405
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:43,750
--Aren't those--
--[KAHO] Kanade?

406
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:45,458
[KAHO] He's going to think
I'm the one who stole

407
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:47,166
his dad's underwear!

408
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:49,958
I swear to you, this isn't,
um, how it looks.

409
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:52,083
[KANADE] These are the
undies I gave Mafuyu!

410
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:53,541
[KAHO]
Wait, what?

411
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:54,875
[KANADE] She asked me for
something that smelled like

412
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:56,291
the person she loves.

413
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:59,250
[KAHO] But those are your
father's dirty underwear.

414
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:03,000
In her own way, she's
making her love active.

415
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:05,166
When someone has
feelings for another,

416
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:06,750
you gotta support 'em.

417
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:09,625
[KAHO] So that's how
Kanade sees things.

418
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:11,208
It makes sense, though.

419
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:12,791
He's so innocent.

420
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:14,166
[KANADE]
Kaho.

421
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:15,541
Hey. You're flushed.

422
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:18,291
[KAHO] You're getting
too close, Kanade!

423
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:19,416
[KANADE]
I know!

424
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:24,000
Um... What are you doing?

425
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:25,583
You're clearly tired.

426
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:27,250
I'm gonna make you feel better.

427
00:21:29,541 --> 00:21:31,791
[KAHO] You don't have to.
It's the thought that counts.

428
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:34,208
Thoughts alone
aren't good enough.

429
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:36,458
That's the same thing
as doing nothing at all.

430
00:21:36,541 --> 00:21:39,583
If you don't act on your
feelings, then what's the point?

431
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:42,958
[KAHO] So, he's acting
on his feelings for me?

432
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:45,250
He's showing me
how much he cares.

433
00:21:51,583 --> 00:21:53,333
[KOTA]
Oh, no, Miss Nikaido!

434
00:21:56,708 --> 00:21:59,000
You just relax. I got this.

435
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:02,291
[KAHO]
That feels so nice.

436
00:22:02,375 --> 00:22:03,958
[KANADE]
How about here, Kaho?

437
00:22:04,041 --> 00:22:05,166
Do you like that, too?

438
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:08,666
[KAHO panting]

439
00:23:40,208 --> 00:23:41,291
[RENREN]
Renren here!

440
00:23:41,375 --> 00:23:44,000
Coming up on
<i>First Love Monster</i> .

441
00:23:44,083 --> 00:23:46,625
[RENREN]
Uh-oh. Not so tight!

442
00:23:46,708 --> 00:23:48,291
I think I'm gonna...!

443
00:23:48,375 --> 00:23:50,041
Oh, no!

444
00:23:50,125 --> 00:23:52,750
[RENREN] All on the next
<i>First Love Monster</i> !

445
00:23:52,833 --> 00:23:54,791
"I Know. To The Bath House!"
