I can't help it.

162
00:09:21,791 --> 00:09:24,125
I wanna know what's going on.

163
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:25,916
It's him! It's Kanade.

164
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:30,708
So are you, like, gonna
head back home right now?

165
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:32,833
Probably. I'm just
waiting for Tom and Gin.

166
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:34,166
They're in the bathroom.

167
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:38,208
Kanade, I heard you broke up
with your dumb girlfriend.

168
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:39,708
Well, you know those
high-school girls

169
00:09:39,791 --> 00:09:41,583
are basically grandmas.

170
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:43,250
I'm so glad to be done with her.

171
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:46,750
Jeez, they're taking forever.

172
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:48,750
Oh! Yeah, I bet they
had to go poo.

173
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:50,750
They did have seconds at lunch.

174
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:54,250
Uh, sure, what with being
growing young-men and all that.

175
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:55,583
The bottom line, babe?

176
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:57,083
You're looking at a free agent.

177
00:09:57,166 --> 00:10:00,041
That so? Then maybe I'll
put in my own bid for ya.

[GUARD 7A]
Um, excuse me, Miss?

179
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:06,583
[KAHO] What do you want?
I'm kinda busy.

180
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:09,875
"Kinda busy"
doing what, exactly?

181
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:11,125
Why are you here?

182
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:12,625
It's not what you think!

183
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:14,291
I'm not like a deviant! I...

[groans]

185

Oh! I'm just a simple
high-school girl 

186
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:20,375
who has a crush on an
elementary school boy!

[GUARD 7A] Which means
you're coming with me.

188
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:25,500
Look, you've got it all wrong!
This is perfectly innocent!

189
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:28,291
Is everything okay?

190
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:31,041
Yeah. Sometimes I
randomly hear stuff.

191
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:36,166
Thanks for waiting,

Pucker up, buttercup,
it's a setup!

00:10:38,416 --> 00:10:40,791
[KANADE] All right.
See ya later, Yuki-gator!

[MAKURAZAKI] May I have
a moment, if you please?

196
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:51,458
[MAKURAZAKI] I'm terribly
sorry for this disturbance.

197
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:52,958
Don't be! It's fine.

198
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:55,916
[KANADE]
Cool, it's Kaz's muttler.

199
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,458
His muttler? Like a pet?

200
00:10:58,541 --> 00:11:01,166
Yeah, he's pretty
much Kaz's pet.

Thank you for
your gracious words!

Master Kanade,
Master Tom, Master Gin.

204
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:15,250
I, Munemitsu Makurazaki,
need your assistance.

205
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:17,583
Master Kaz is in
a horrible crisis!

206
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:21,375
[GIN]
This is the real setup!

207
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:28,625
[MAKURAZAKI] In the ten years
since I began my service,

208
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:32,125
a mere 100 days
after his birth...

209
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:34,208
I have never,
not even once,

210
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:36,958
seen the young master in
such a state of distress.

211
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:42,916
[MAKURAZAKI] Unbelievably,
his perfection has been marred.

212
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,041
He has confused his Tuesday
and his Wednesday schedules!

213
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:48,208
He has failed to arrange
his pencils by length

214
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:49,791
in their appropriate case.

215
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:52,208
He even misbuttoned
his shirt whilst dressing.

216
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:53,500
Kaz did all that?

217
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:55,666
Doesn't sound like
a big deal to me.

218
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,041
I'm very worried, boys.

219
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:59,375
His temperature today was 97.2,

220
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:01,125
so he'll stay home
from school tomorrow.

221
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:02,291
[KANADE, GIN, TOM]
He's gonna miss school?

222
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:04,875
[YUKI]
That's a normal temperature.

223
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:06,708
It would appear my master has...

224
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:08,666
He's been stricken with
what can only be described

225
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:09,916
as "lovesickness."

226
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,958
[YUKI]
Huh?

227
00:12:12,416 --> 00:12:14,208
[MAKURAZAKI]
Please, I beg of you!

228
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:17,333
Do what you can to find
this object of his affection!

229
00:12:17,416 --> 00:12:19,916
And when she is found...

230
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,333
For the young master's sake,
I, Makurazaki,

231
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:24,666
will do what I must!

00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:27,625
It'll be tough,
but we can do it.

The Bamboo Elementary
Young Detective Squad!

And just like that,
the YDS is in business!

Hey, um...

Aren't they thieves instead
of detectives, though?

245
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:54,791
All right, now according
to witness testimony...

246
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:56,833
[KAZ]
It happened not too long ago.

247
00:12:56,916 --> 00:13:00,916
I fell in love with the soulful
owner of this poetry journal.

248
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,916
I couldn't help myself.

249
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,291
Her tears and pure heart poured
on those pages changed me.

250
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:09,208
--Poetry?
--Pure heart?

251
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:12,458
It's not them.

252
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:14,083
Which means Kasumi House
could not have been

253
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:16,375
the scene of the
love-striking crime.

254
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:19,041
So where else could
this poetry be going on?

255
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:21,583
No one writes anything
in gym class, so not there!

256
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:23,458
Wasn't in the nurse's
office, either.

257
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:25,041
Well, what about
the bathrooms?

258
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:26,708
We can't count
those out, can we?

259
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:29,750
You guys, you're heading
towards inappropriate territory.

260
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:32,708
Keep in mind, it has to
be a girl we've never met.

I just solved
the whole mystery!

00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,500
The girl is Bathroom Hanako!

[BOYS]
Yay!

00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:45,125
[YUKI] I know I kinda got
swept up in following you here,

267
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:46,583
but I'm gonna head back.

00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:50,666
[KAZ]
I can't believe it.

269
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:52,958
Hanako? That's her real name?

270
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:54,416
Swear to me you're sure of it!

271
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,583
Oh, we swear.

272
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:57,000
Our deductions are flawless,

273
00:13:57,083 --> 00:13:59,041
although she may
be nicknamed "Mary."

274
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:01,541
Yes, I see.

275
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:03,875
So the girl I love
is named Hanako.

276
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:10,291
Okay, what else?
Where does she live?

277
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:12,416
We hate to tell you this.

278
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:15,250
She lives in the bathroom!

279
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:16,791
Bathroom? What?

280
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:18,666
Our search revealed the truth.

281
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,625
Seems she's in the
bathroom all the time.

282
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:22,458
[KAZ] There is no way that
a lady would ever live

283
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:23,708
in a restroom!

284
00:14:23,791 --> 00:14:25,125
She might have a bad stomach.

285
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:27,541
Most likely, she just
has to poop a lot.

286
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:29,583
That's an extremely
rude thing to say.

287
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:30,875
[KANADE]
No, Kaz, it's not.

288
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:33,583
Women can do anything
men can do, even dookie.

289
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:37,958
[KAZ] But then, that would
mean my darling Hanako

290
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:40,041
has been left there to
suffer alone in the bathroom

291
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:41,625
for who knows how long.

292
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:45,500
I know! Why don't you
take her some medicine?

293
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:49,666
As a future OBGYN,
I have to agree with Tom.

294
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,541
But I can't simply
walk into a bathroom

295
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:53,000
with a lady present.

296
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:54,625
Not yet. It's far too early.

297
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:57,000
What are you saying, Kaz?

298
00:14:57,083 --> 00:14:59,791
The woman that you love
is suffering right now!

299
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:01,458
I couldn't ignore her pain.

300
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:04,125
Not me.

301
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:07,375
Kanade?

302
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:08,416
Hey, guess what?

303
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,250
Kanade broke up
with his girlfriend.

304
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:12,708
[KAZ] What? You really
ended it with Kaho?

305
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:15,916
[KANADE]
I did. It's over.

306
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,916
I'm so sorry, I, uh...

307
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,916
[KANADE] However,
it's not over for you yet.

308
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,666
Go give that medicine
to the one you love

309
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,625
with your own two hands!

310
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:29,791
Kanade...
You're such a wonderful guy.

311
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:32,708
Come on, Kaz, let's go!

312
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:33,958
We were prepared.

313
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:36,291
Her medication is ready.

314
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:38,666
You guys... thank you.

315
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:39,916
Sure.

Whatcha snoopin'
around again for?

317
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,291
Fess up.

00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:49,500
Me? What?

319
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:51,583
[TAGA] Just more of
your usual spying crap?

320
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:53,875
Classic you. A pretty
piece of human trash.

321
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:55,500
[KOTA]
That's not true!

322
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:58,791
Kanade came back home really
excited for some reason.

323
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:01,291
I wanted to make sure
they couldn't involve me.

324
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:02,833
Right.

325
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:05,125
You are quite the nice little
toy for those stupid brats.

326
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:06,958
Hey, who do you think
you're calling a toy?

[KANADE]
Here we go!

00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,541
[KANADE] The Young Detective
Squad is on the move!

329
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:15,541

00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:16,791
Yeah.

331
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:18,875
You didn't hear
this from us, got it?

332
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:20,791
Our sleuth work has
revealed the identity

333
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:22,541
of Kaz's mysterious lady.

334
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:24,625
Who's Kaz?

335
00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:27,208
Oh, he's the one of
you that looks normal.

336
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:29,250
Apparently, it was
love at first sight.

337
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:31,708
Then, he saw her poetry
journal here yesterday.

338
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:35,583
Love at first sight, you say?

339
00:16:35,666 --> 00:16:38,250
And we found out her
name is Bathroom Hanako!

340
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:40,208
As soon as we get the
two of them together,

342

How fascinating.

Okay! You guys ready to head
to the scene of the crime?

Job's one of my specialties!

00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:56,458
You know who I am.

349
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:59,958
Joji Takahashi, elementary
school detective of the west!

Huh? No, not me.

I know you know
what'll happen, too,

00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:26,833
Okay.

363
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:30,875
The truth is...
Kaz's mystery girl is, um...

364
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:34,125
She's me. I was dressed
up as a girl yesterday.

365
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:39,166
Hey! Why do you look like you
just got some big juicy scoop?

366
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:40,375
Because I did.

It's fine.

It's about Hanako, not me.

374
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:01,000
Why are you
doing this to me?

375

Those children need
supervision, don't they?

Let's go.

[TAGA]
What's that?

378
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:15,916
It's Hanako's poetry journal.

379
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,250
I plan to return it
when I see her next.

380
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:20,916
I've held on to it.

381
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,125
Of course you have.

00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:25,375
Well, you never know;
this girl might be a lot closer

than you think.

00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:28,375
That's true.

385
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:31,375
It's funny. I never imagined
we'd be at the same school.

What the heck?

00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,375
Why's the door locked?

388
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:36,750
[KOTA] Probably because
it's after hours.

389
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:39,208
[GIN] You mean like
a locked-room mystery?

390
00:18:39,291 --> 00:18:41,333

It's not really a room, so...

Anybody there?! Hey!

392
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:47,416
Did somebody say
somethin' 'bout a locked room?

No crime's perfect with the

about this whole thing!

are ya talkin' about?

[KANADE]
Isn't it obvious?

400
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:04,083
How could Hanako have gotten
into the school if it's locked?

401
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:05,708
[KAZ]
Kanade has a point.

402
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:08,500
Teachers are the only ones who
should have keys to the school.

403
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:10,125
[TOM] So what? You're
telling me that Hanako

404
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:12,125
couldn't even get
into the bathroom?

405
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:15,125
I feel like this conversation
just took a really strange turn.

Meh, who cares?
No one's getting hurt.

407
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,500
[KANADE] But what if...
What if Hanako could get in

408
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:20,708
without a key?

409
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:22,291
What are ya saying, Kanade?

410
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:23,833
Ya really think
she could be a...?

No, I refuse to believe it.

412
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:28,500
Nothing about that is
scientific or logical.

413
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:30,041
There's no way.

414
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:33,833
I'm surprised you didn't
already know about this, fellas.

415
00:19:33,916 --> 00:19:36,458
Bathroom Hanako
died a long time ago.

416
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:37,750
She's a ghost.

417
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:40,875
A ghost?
You can't be serious!

418

Oh no, oh no, oh no!

00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:43,625

I have to do.

Not that I'm running
away or anything.

421

Just spotted the entrance to
the continent of Mu over there.

Hanako is really a ghost?

00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:54,500
Indeed.

426
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:56,166
Which leads me to believe
that the girl you like

427
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:57,666

meant to do that.

Anyway, my point is
that it was pretty rough

for everyone back in the day.

So what did you do whenever
you had a frightened turtle?

468

You just had to hold
it in until you got home.

The worst.

is a Speed Doodie Doer, too!

475
00:23:13,666 --> 00:23:16,125
Yeah, I don't understand
why it's such a big deal.

476
00:23:16,208 --> 00:23:18,500
Everyone poops.
There's even a book about it.

477
00:23:18,583 --> 00:23:21,375
Amen. Heck, I personally
tell the girls before I'm off

478
00:23:21,458 --> 00:23:23,166
to commit a corn massacre.

479
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:25,166
Too far, Gin. That was too far.

480
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:26,625
[ARASHI laughs]

481
00:23:26,708 --> 00:23:29,541
Aw, the good old days
were certainly miserable.

482
00:23:29,625 --> 00:23:32,333
I, personally, never
go to the bathroom.

483
00:23:32,416 --> 00:23:33,666
You don't? How come?

484
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:34,833
I just don't.

485
00:23:34,916 --> 00:23:36,166
What? Come on, Taga!

486
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:38,000
I just don't.

487
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,666
Are you like a god?

488
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:43,166
[RENREN] Coming up
on <i>First Love Monster</i> .

489
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:45,291
Ken. Ken Tanaka.

490
00:23:45,375 --> 00:23:46,875
Ken Tanaka here.

491
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:48,791
All that and more.

492
00:23:48,875 --> 00:23:52,125
Next time:
"Kanade's Telephone Helpline."

493
00:23:52,208 --> 00:23:53,958
Sorry, I'm feeling off today.
