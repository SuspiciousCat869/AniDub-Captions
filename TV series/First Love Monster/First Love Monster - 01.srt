1
00:00:26,583 --> 00:00:27,625
[KAHO]
Wait.

2
00:00:28,458 --> 00:00:29,500
Do you mind, um...

3
00:00:29,583 --> 00:00:31,333
Do you mind telling
me your name?

4
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:34,500
Yeah, I do mind.

5
00:00:36,791 --> 00:00:39,208
I'm not supposed to
give my name to strangers.

6
00:00:39,291 --> 00:00:41,333
Plus, you're kinda creepy.

7
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:50,333
[KAHO]
And thus my first love ended.

8
00:00:51,375 --> 00:00:53,583
Let me go back
to when it all started--

9
00:00:53,666 --> 00:00:56,125
all the way back
to three hours ago.

10
00:00:56,208 --> 00:00:58,041
My name is Kaho Nikaido.

11
00:00:58,125 --> 00:01:00,666
My family, well,
they're kind of a big deal.

12
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,416
Basically, they're rich.

13
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:05,333
Like, super rich rich.

14
00:01:05,416 --> 00:01:08,250
My parents treated me
like their little princess.

15
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:10,583
You could say they
spoiled me rotten.

16
00:01:10,666 --> 00:01:13,791
It's probably because they
had me when they were older.

17
00:01:13,875 --> 00:01:17,375
My teachers and people in town
were intimidated by my family,

18
00:01:17,458 --> 00:01:20,208
so they made sure to
never get upset with me.

19
00:01:20,291 --> 00:01:21,625
My friends were all schoolmates

20
00:01:21,708 --> 00:01:24,750
that my parents asked
to hang out with me.

21
00:01:24,833 --> 00:01:26,750
So as a result,

22
00:01:26,833 --> 00:01:30,208
I have no idea what it's like
to have someone mad at me.

23
00:01:30,291 --> 00:01:32,625
What would you think
of a person like that?

24
00:01:32,708 --> 00:01:34,833
A total disaster, right?

25
00:01:34,916 --> 00:01:36,916
A big loser.

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,625
I wish I was never born.

27
00:01:40,458 --> 00:01:42,958
[KAHO] So this spring,
I left my hometown.

28
00:01:43,041 --> 00:01:45,541
And I decided to start
high school in the city.

29
00:01:50,125 --> 00:01:52,125
I guess this is Kasumi house.

30
00:01:53,916 --> 00:01:55,208
Ah...

31
00:01:55,291 --> 00:01:56,458
[KAHO screams]

32
00:01:56,541 --> 00:01:58,416
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to scream--

33
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:02,125
[KOTA] Excuse me,
are you Miss Nikaido?

34
00:02:02,208 --> 00:02:03,416
[KAHO]
You know my name?

35
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,250
Are you the landlord?

36
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:06,416
Well... I wouldn't say that...

37
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,458
[KAHO]
He's so young!

38
00:02:07,541 --> 00:02:09,125
Are all Tokyo
landlords like that?

39
00:02:09,208 --> 00:02:11,458
I bet he made a bunch
of money in IT or something.

40
00:02:11,541 --> 00:02:12,958
Yeah, it has to be IT.

41
00:02:13,041 --> 00:02:14,625
And now, he's managing
apartments he bought

42
00:02:14,708 --> 00:02:16,208
--with all that money!
--No, wait a sec!

43
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:18,333
I'm just a normal
high school student!

44
00:02:18,416 --> 00:02:20,250
The landlord had
other stuff to do today,

45
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:23,125
so he asked me
to help him out.

46
00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:25,750
[KAHO] Well, I guess that
was a pointless delusion.

47
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:27,083
Thank you very much.

48
00:02:27,166 --> 00:02:28,958
It's nice to meet you.

49
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:31,000
[KOTA] Yeah, same here.
Nice to meet you, too.

50
00:02:31,083 --> 00:02:33,125
Can we bring in your things,
or you just gonna keep that up?

51
00:02:33,208 --> 00:02:35,208
[KOTA]
Right. Uh, second floor, please!

52
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:37,166
[KAHO]
Oh, I don't mind helping!

53
00:02:40,583 --> 00:02:43,250
[KAHO] Wow, these are heavier
than I thought they'd be.

54
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,416
Whoa! Are you all right?

55
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,000
[WORKERS laughing]

56
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:55,791
Just stay there, little girl.
We don't need you getting hurt.

57
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:59,791
[WORKERS laughing]

58
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:03,791
[KAHO]
And here I am in the way again.

59
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:10,708
No! The <i>kokeshi</i>
my brother gave me!

60
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:12,833
Wait, <i>kokeshi</i> !

61
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:15,333
My brother will kill me
if I lose you!

62
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:21,750
[horn blares]

63
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:44,583
Do you wanna die or somethin'?!

64
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:49,208
Didn't anyone ever
tell you not to jump out

65
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:50,916
into the middle of
the street like that?

66
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,708
If a truck hit a little
bitty thing like you,

67
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:55,375
you would've been squashed flat
just like an ant or a frog

68
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:57,458
or a turtle gets squashed!

69
00:03:57,541 --> 00:04:00,375
Hello? Are you even listening?

70
00:04:00,458 --> 00:04:02,583
What is it you want from me?

71
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:04,500
Just tell me what it is. Money?

72
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:06,083
A favor from my mom and dad?

73
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:09,958
I'm not interested in money or
your parents or anything else.

74
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:12,041
[KAHO]
Liar.

75
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:14,000
You wouldn't bother
saving a loser like me

76
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:16,291
if you weren't after something.

77
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:17,708
[KANADE] Aren't you
supposed to save people

78
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,250
who are about to die?

79
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:22,083
And I heard if you call
yourself a loser too much,

80
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:24,083
you'll actually
wind up becoming one.

81
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:29,458
You're small.
But you are pretty cute.

82
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:30,791
Come on.

83
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:32,916
You're a loser, my foot.

84
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,208
[KAHO]
Cute?

85
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:36,583
Did I hear him right?

86
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:37,708
[KANADE]
Later.

87
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:41,125
[KAHO]
Wait.

88
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:42,458
Um... Do you...

89
00:04:42,541 --> 00:04:44,833
Do you mind telling me
what your name is, please?

90
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:46,083
[KANADE]
Huh?

91
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:47,833
Yeah. I do mind.

92
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:50,375
I'm not supposed to
give my name to strangers.

93
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:52,291
Plus, you're kind of creepy.

94
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:59,166
[KAHO] And that brings us
back to where we started.

95
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,500
[KOTA]
Um, are you okay?

96
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:38,083
Oh, good. I mean...

97
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:40,583
We wouldn't want you getting
hurt on your first day here.

98
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:41,458
[KAHO gasps]

99
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:43,041
He saw that? Oh my god!

100
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:44,791
The guy I just met totally saw
me fall in love at first sight,

101
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:47,083
get called creepy,
and then be rejected!

102
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,125
[KOTA] You should know
something about that boy

103
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:54,208
you were talking to.

104
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:56,541
[CHIAKI]
Hold on, Shinohara!

105
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:57,625
[KOTA]
Chiaki!

106
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:04,083
Let me cut to the
chase here, sweetheart.

107
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:06,666
Be honest. You fell in love
with that boy, didn't you?

108
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:10,791
[KOTA gasps]

109
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:12,250
[KAHO]
Wait, how did you know?

110
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:14,500
Are... are you a psychic?

111
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:16,333
No, but people like me
do have a way of just

112
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:17,541
knowing these things.

113
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:19,708
[KAHO] You mean like
city high-school girls?

114
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:21,375
Oh, it doesn't matter anyway.

115
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:23,208
I don't even know
what his name is.

116
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:25,541
And it's not like I'll
ever see him again.

117
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:29,208
[CHIAKI]
What if you did, though?

118
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:31,500
If... I saw him again?

119
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,166
Like I was trying to say...

120
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:34,750
Shut it, Shinohara!

Those who'd try and
thwart a young girl's love

00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:38,666
should go trip over a <i>kokeshi</i> !

Jeez, no wonder
you're still a virgin.

to do with anything!

Why don't you act your age?

Like you're one
to talk, old man.

assume I hadn't--

Are you saying I'm wrong?

like that all the time.

I hope I can get used to it.

So much happened today.

00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:44,291
If a guy who saves my life
can turn around and reject me,

00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:47,375
I bet no one else will
want me as long as I live.

00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:52,875
[KANADE] I heard if you call
yourself a loser too much,

00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:54,916
you'll actually wind up
becoming one.

No way I'll ever see him again.

I mean, if I do,
that has to be fate, right?

152
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:08,875
It's you.

153
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:12,041
Hey, what's up?
I didn't know you lived here.

154

00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,708

Wait! Wait up!
Today you saved me,

159
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:24,958
and I got yelled at for the
first time ever, like ever!

160
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:26,125
[KANADE]
Really?

161
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:28,500
Weird. My whole life
is being yelled at.

162
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:31,166
And... to be... to be honest...

163
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:33,208
I didn't think we'd
ever meet again.

164
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:35,541
That makes no sense.
We live in the same house.

165
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:36,750
It's bound to happen.

166
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:38,458
[KAHO]
That's true. Um...

167
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:41,416
Oh yeah, my name is
Kanade Takahashi.

168
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,333
So it's okay to
tell me your name now?

169
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:46,208
For sure. You can't be a gross
stranger if you're living here.

170
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:47,583
Okay, it's your turn.

171
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:49,250
When someone says
what their name is,

172
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:51,166
it's polite to tell
them yours in return.

173
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:53,500
You're right. I'm sorry.
It's Kaho Nikaido.

174
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:54,916
Cool. Later, Kaho.

175
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,416
No, please wait a sec!

176
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,666
Why? What else could
you have to say?

177
00:09:58,750 --> 00:09:59,791
[KAHO]
I...

178
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:02,041
Um, it looks like...

179

This is so sudden,
but I think I love you!

180
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:15,500
[KANADE]
I don't mind dating you.

181
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,916
If you still say you
love me after you find out

182
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,916
who I really am,
then yeah, we can totally date.

183
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:26,208
Think about it
until tomorrow, okay?

184
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:27,375
No way!

185
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:37,333
[KAHO] What did he mean
by "who he really is"?

186
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:39,083
Maybe he's married?

187
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:40,625
Or has kids?

188
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:42,166
What if he's into guys?

189
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:43,875
What if he's really a girl?

190
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:45,291
It could be tons of debt.

191
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,666
He could be an alien!

192
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,250
Or from the future!

193
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:49,791
Does he have ESP?

194
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,833
[KAHO]
I didn't sleep a wink.

195
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:58,750
It doesn't matter to me
what his secret is, though.

196
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:00,208
I'll deal with it.

197
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:01,416
And then...

198
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,791
I guess I'll go out with him.

199
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:12,708
I can't believe you came!

200
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:19,333
Tell me.

00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:28,166
Well, I'm still
in elementary school.

202

So what now?

203
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:42,708

And thus,

the monster known
as "first love"

assault on my heart.

206
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:56,416
[KANADE] So are we gonna
go out now, or what?

00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,041
Oh. I, um... uh...

208
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:00,250
Okay!

209
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:04,333
[KANADE]
Cool!

210
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:06,916
Then starting today,
you're my girlfriend.

"Cool." Right.

I can't date a kid his age!

Yodel-ay-hee-hoo, Kanade!

Are these your friends?

Yep. We're all
in the same class.

Four eyes over here is Gin.

00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:36,416
And this other guy with
the weird hair is Tom.

221
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:42,625
[KAHO] Do all elementary school
kids look like that nowadays?

Guys, I'd like you
to meet my girlfriend.

223
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,250
Um... Nice to meet you?

224
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:48,583
Man!

225
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:50,791
I was gonna be the one
to get a girlfriend first!

226
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:52,166
She's even older than us!

227
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:53,416
Good for you.

228
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,500
Be proud.

229
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:56,125
You're climbing stairs
to adulthood.

Stairs to adulthood?

to the new couple.

238
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,416
[KAHO]
No, I was just being nice.

239
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,625
I can't go out with Kanade.

240
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:17,875
Of course not.

241
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:20,125
We're talking about a
fifth grader here, girl.

242
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:21,583
Indecent much?

243
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:22,750
Criminal? Maybe.

00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:24,083
Perverted? Yeah.

245
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:26,291
But then again,
on the other hand...

246
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:27,958
You did tell him you'd
be his girlfriend,

247
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:30,166
so I wonder how he'd feel
if you told him "never mind"

248
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:32,625
and that you were just
"trying to be nice."

249
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:34,041
Kanade's a lonely kid.

250

Although, who wouldn't be
after losing their mother

[PRINCIPAL] What I'd like the
students of Bamboo Primary

253
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:52,125
to remember today is "sushi."

254
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:53,958
Not the food, but the letters.

255
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,375
S is for stranger danger...

Hey, Kanade!
Why are you running?

wiener away like that!

I mean, get real.
Where's it gonna go?

Oh, good. I'm happy
everything worked out.

293
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:40,708
It can only be played when

to get to higher ground in order
to avoid the player deemed "it."

Are you really climbing
those dumb poles again?

318
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:52,250
[KANADE] Of course he is.
Gin really likes those things!

319
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:53,958
If you weren't such
a dumb-butt-head,

320
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:55,583
you might be able to
understand what it is

321
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:56,666
I like about 'em.

322
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:57,958
[TOM]
Okay, fine.

323
00:16:58,041 --> 00:16:59,833
What's so great
about stupid poles?

324
00:17:04,208 --> 00:17:05,083
[TOM]
Oh, yeah.

325
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:07,083
I think I get it.

326
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:08,750
[GIN]
You're welcome.

327
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:11,416
Hey guys, whaddaya
think's taking Kaz so long?

328
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,958
Kaz?

329
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:15,750
[TOM] He's only the most
awesome kid in the whole school.

330
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:17,583
[GIN] Yeah, he's even
more awesome than we are.

331
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:19,666
[KAHO] Ah! You mean there's
another fifth-grade boy

332
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:22,125
who's decidedly
un-fifth-grade-like?

333
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:25,541
[KAZ]
Oh, yeah.

334
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:27,250
I'm in elementary school, too.

335
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:28,416
What of it?

336
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,000
Kaho, don't you go
cheating on me with him.

337
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:33,000
I would never
cheat on someone.

338
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:34,708
Well, sure, you say that now.

339
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:35,625
Watch out.

340
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:37,666
He might steal her away, Kanade.

341
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:38,708
He's a big deal.

342
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:40,125
We're talking about
our class rep.

343
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:41,708
[KANADE]
Are you trying to piss me off?

344
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:43,458
[KAZ]
Apologies for being late.

345
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:44,958
[TOM]
You finally made it!

346
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:47,416
[KAHO] I wonder if I could
just not turn around.

347
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,750
Let me introduce you.

348
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:50,583
Kaho, this is Kaz.

349
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:51,625
Nice to meet you.

350
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:53,000
I'm Kazuo Noguchi.

351
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:59,291
[KAHO] Finally, a
normal-looking fifth grader!

352
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:01,416
[GIN] Kaz's awesomeness
made her collapse.

353
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,541
[KANADE]
I know.

354
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:07,625
I'm sorry if I
disappointed you, Kaho.

355
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:08,875
Oh, no.

356
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:11,291
To be honest with you,
I'm kind of relieved.

357
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:14,250
[GIN]
Whoa.

358
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:15,958
This feels like a setup
for a girlfriend swap.

359
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:17,083
Yeah, it does.

360
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:18,541
What are you gonna do, man?

361
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:19,708
[KANADE]
Hey, shut up.

362
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:22,000
I'm not gonna
share my girlfriend.

363
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:23,416
Kanade, um...

364
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,625
It's embarrassing when
you say it out loud like that.

365
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:31,916
[KANADE]
Ready?

366
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,291
Back to the game!

367
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:35,125
[TOM]
All right! I'm still "it"!

368
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:36,541
Hey, wait a second!

369
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:38,000
No way. No time-outs!

370
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:39,416
[GIN]
But it's an emergency!

371
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:44,250
Ew! Are we timing out so
you can adjust your junk?

372
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:46,458
Gotcha. No one
wants a wiener leaner.

373
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:47,791
Wiener leaner?

374
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:55,000
You get one when you don't
find the most comfortable spot

375
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:56,333
to place your wiener.

376
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,083
[shrieks]

377
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:02,416
[KAHO]
Wow...

378
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:05,333
I've just connected some
extremely mortifying dots!

379
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:08,125
Yeah, but you can do it
from your pockets, like this.

380
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:10,458
The direct approach
is more reliable.

381
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:12,916
Fine, but don't touch
me with your wiener hands!

382
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,500
[GIN]
Heh.

383
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:16,333
Telling me not to touch you just
makes me want to touch you more.

384
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:18,666
No! He's got the wiener hands!

385
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,416
Look out!
Gin's got the wiener touch!

386
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,833
[TOM]
Run away!

387
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:24,125
If you catch it, your fingers
will turn into wieners!

388
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:26,083
No! Don't you even
think about it, Gin.

389
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:27,750
You can't touch me
with those things!

390
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:30,541
[GIN] All I heard was
"Touch me with those things."

391
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:33,166
Wiener! Wiener!

392
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:35,333
Wiener! Wiener!

393
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:36,375
[KANADE]
Olé!

394
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:39,750
[GIN]
Wiener.

395
00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:49,416
[growling]

396
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,208
[GIN]
Ding-a-ling!

397
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:52,625
--[KAHO yelps]
--[KANADE] Kaho!

398
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:58,791
[KAHO]
He saved me again.

399
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:07,750
If you see that
a girl is in trouble,

400
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:10,375
you should always
reach out to help her.

401
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:13,458
See, my mom taught me that.

402
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:15,458
Your mother did?

403
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:16,500
Don't worry.

404
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:17,875
Trust me.

405
00:20:17,958 --> 00:20:21,125
I'll protect you
no matter what happens.

406
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:22,750
[KAHO]
Thank you, Kanade.

407
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:29,041
[RADIO] Attention all
children playing outside...

408
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:30,291
Oh, crap!

409
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:32,750
I'm gonna get Namiko's
fists if I'm late again!

410
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:33,875
[GIN]
I have cram school.

411
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:35,041
[KANADE]
See you guys later!

412
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:36,083
[KAZ]
Kaho?

413
00:20:37,708 --> 00:20:40,250
[TOM] Yeah, you don't want to
end up with wieners for fingers.

414
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:41,833
I should let you know.

415
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:45,125
It's nothing personal, but I'm
against you and Kanade dating.

416
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:49,041
[laughing]

417
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:50,708
[KANADE]
You guys are so stupid.

418
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:24,916
[KAZ] All right, it's time for
our after-class homeroom.

419
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,916
--[KANADE, KOTA, TOM] Okay!
--[GIN] Bring it!

420
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,666
Today I'd like to discuss the
results you see on this board!

421
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:30,833
Wow.

422
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:32,208
You sure did give us
a lot of marks, huh?

423
00:22:32,291 --> 00:22:33,250
Cool.

424
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:34,666
I've got the second
highest number.

425
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:37,208
[GIN] And if I have the most,
that means I win, right?

426
00:22:37,291 --> 00:22:38,791
Oh, I know!

427
00:22:38,875 --> 00:22:40,958
That must be the number of good
stuff we've done for the day!

428
00:22:41,041 --> 00:22:42,750
Wrong! It's the opposite!

429
00:22:42,833 --> 00:22:44,416
The more marks,
the more you must reflect

430
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,958
on what you've done!

431
00:22:46,041 --> 00:22:47,041
[GIN]
Wait, what?

432
00:22:47,125 --> 00:22:48,458
It's a tally.

433
00:22:48,541 --> 00:22:50,708
These are how many times
certain words have been said.

434
00:22:50,791 --> 00:22:52,541
You mean like
th-the kinds of things

435
00:22:52,625 --> 00:22:54,791
you can't say like
on TV and stuff?

436
00:22:54,875 --> 00:22:56,125
Those words?

437
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:57,666
Yes. Precisely those.

438
00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:00,416
For real? What could we have
possibly said that many times?

439
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,291
Yeah, I can't think
of anything that bad.

440
00:23:02,375 --> 00:23:04,583
All we really did today was
hang out on the jungle gym

441
00:23:04,666 --> 00:23:06,000
hitting our--[toot]

442
00:23:06,083 --> 00:23:08,125
and then we climbed the poles
to rub on our--[toot]

443
00:23:08,208 --> 00:23:10,333
I mean, we did take a little
time for [toot] adjusting,

444
00:23:10,416 --> 00:23:12,416
but we didn't say
anything bad. Huh?

445
00:23:14,375 --> 00:23:16,750
[GIN]
The count's gone up!

446
00:23:16,833 --> 00:23:18,500
How come?

447
00:23:18,583 --> 00:23:19,500
[TOM]
What gives?

448
00:23:19,583 --> 00:23:20,750
All he said was
[toot] and [toot]!

449
00:23:20,833 --> 00:23:21,958
There's nothing wrong with that!

450
00:23:22,041 --> 00:23:22,708
Those are normal words!

451
00:23:22,791 --> 00:23:23,750
That's dumb!

452
00:23:23,833 --> 00:23:25,333
[KOTA]
So much noise. Please stop.

453
00:23:25,416 --> 00:23:26,583
[recorder blowing]

454
00:23:26,666 --> 00:23:28,166
[KAZ]
Enough already!

455
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:30,666
Stop it! I want you to
stop saying "wiener"!

456
00:23:34,666 --> 00:23:36,291
You let them
get to you, buddy.

457
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:38,583
[KAZ]
Oh.

458
00:23:40,041 --> 00:23:41,458
[RENREN]
Renren here!

459
00:23:41,541 --> 00:23:43,666
High-school freshman Kaho is
dating fifth-grader Kanade.

460
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:45,875
It's her first love, not to
mention her first boyfriend,

461
00:23:45,958 --> 00:23:47,666
and she's determined
to learn more about him.

462

All on the next First Love
Monster: "Ah, Kasumi House"!

463
00:23:51,458 --> 00:23:52,666
And now for a match!

464
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:54,166
Renren, paper, scissors!
