1
00:00:15,666 --> 00:00:17,708
It's simple.
The card for Kaho!

2
00:00:17,791 --> 00:00:19,708
[KANADE] Maybe we
should all date together!

3
00:00:19,791 --> 00:00:21,791
You, me, and
Kaho makes three!

4
00:00:21,875 --> 00:00:23,916
Don't worry.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,250
I'll take her with me.

6
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:26,583
[KAHO]
I just can't!

7
00:02:02,083 --> 00:02:03,708
[KANADE] Kota!
Gimme your seaweed.

8
00:02:05,916 --> 00:02:08,625
Again? But I already
opened the packet.

9
00:02:08,708 --> 00:02:11,416
That's fine. I don't care.
Gimme your seaweed.

10
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,458
Okay. I suppose
I can let you have it.

11
00:02:13,541 --> 00:02:14,958
Yay! Thank you!

12
00:02:15,041 --> 00:02:16,875
Kaho, gimme yours, too.

13
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,500
Uh-oh.

14
00:02:20,583 --> 00:02:22,833
I bet Kaho's still mad at you.

15
00:02:22,916 --> 00:02:24,083
Mad at me for what?

16
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:27,125
[CHIAKI] You made her
cry literally yesterday.

17
00:02:27,208 --> 00:02:29,125
Yeah, I know,
but it's morning.

18
00:02:29,208 --> 00:02:30,958
You wake up fine
the day after a fight.

19
00:02:31,041 --> 00:02:32,875
That only works for children,

20
00:02:32,958 --> 00:02:35,875
but I suppose it's too much
to expect a mere child

21
00:02:35,958 --> 00:02:37,583
to understand a woman's heart.

22
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:41,791
Understand a woman's heart?

23
00:02:43,958 --> 00:02:45,958
Please tell me you
delivered your letter, Yuki.

24
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:48,500
What? So you really
sent that love letter?

25
00:02:48,583 --> 00:02:49,916
Spill it!
Who'd you give it to?

26
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,250
Uh... I, um... uh...

27
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:53,333
Okay, we'll guess, then.

28
00:02:53,416 --> 00:02:55,250
First, she's got really
high standards.

29
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:57,250
And that's with an
emphasis on the visual!

30
00:02:57,333 --> 00:02:59,791
It has to be a boy
in this class, doesn't it?

31
00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:02,791
[YUI]
Is it Tom?

32
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:05,750
[LEIA] No, he gets
too much attention.

33
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:07,958
There was another TV
special on his stupid-huge

34
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:09,541
family yesterday.

35
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:11,833
I bet even dates with him
would be broadcast live.

36
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:14,250
Ew, no thank you.

37
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:17,291
[LEIA]
Ooh, could it be Gin?

38
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:18,791
I was too busy.

39
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:22,708
Last night, transmissions from
the SM78 nebula needed me.

40
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:23,625
[TOM]
Were you summoning UFOs?

41
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:25,041
No, he's so gross.

42
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:26,666
It definitely can't be him.

43
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:27,708
So gross.

44
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:29,500
[LEIA]
What about Kanade?

45
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:30,833
Oh, son of a rat.

46
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:34,291
I totally left my
backpack somewhere.

47
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:35,916
--What are ya gonna do?
--Just wait.

48
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,375
He'll find his way home.

49
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:39,583
[YUI]
Yeah. I don't think so.

50
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:41,083
Besides, she can't like him.

51
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:43,500
He's already got a girlfriend--
one that's in high school.

52
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:44,833
Crazy, right?

53
00:03:44,916 --> 00:03:46,333
From what I've been told,
they're living together

54
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:47,583
in the same house, too!

55
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:48,625
[GIRLS]
What?!

56
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:49,833
Therefore,

57
00:03:49,916 --> 00:03:51,666
she has to be after
the best guy in class,

58
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,208
and that happens to be...

59
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:57,291
Oh, Master Kaz, it's you!

60
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:59,333
Take your seats, everyone.

61
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:00,666
Since the teacher's out,

62
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,500
we can use this time
to discuss what event

63
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:04,875
we'd like to host during
the school sports festival.

64
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:07,458
[STUDENTS chattering]

65
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:08,708
Quiet, please!

66
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:10,375
Raise your hand if you
have something to say.

67
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:11,500
[KANADE]
I do!

68
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,958
[KAZ]
Kanade Takahashi. Go ahead.

69
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:18,875
I think another student
forgot something at my desk

70
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:20,416
because this isn't mine.

71
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:24,416
Wow, this writing sure is tiny.

72
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,583
"I will be waiting for you at
the equipment shed after class.

73
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:29,875
Come alone."

74
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:31,291
That was no accident.

75
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:32,916
It's a challenge, my friend.

76
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,500
One you can accept,
because I've got your back!

77
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:38,416
So, c'mon, who's the wise guy?

78
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,125
Must be from some girl.

79
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:41,458
The writing is pretty.

80
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:43,000
[FEMALE STUDENT 6A]
Is it me, or...

81
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:44,458
[FEMALE STUDENT 6B]
Its a love letter!

82
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:46,458
[FEMALE STUDENT 6D]
Totally a love letter!

83
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:49,458
[KAZ] Kanade! You are
gravely lacking in delicacy!

84
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:50,875
[KANADE]
Deli-casie?

85
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:51,750
Is that a lunchmeat?

86
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,125
No, it's not!

87
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:54,541
It means you're being
cruel to read a love letter

88
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:56,583
in front of the entire class!

89
00:04:56,666 --> 00:04:58,791
[KANADE]
Wait... This is a love letter?

90
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:01,416
That sucks. Wish it coulda
been a challenge, man.

91
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,541
Well, if it really is
a love letter...

92
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:06,083
Sorry, but I've already
got a girlfriend.

93
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:09,583
[TOM]
Hold on, Kanade.

94
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:11,791
Didn't you two have a
fight yesterday, though?

95
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:13,625
Have you already made up?

96
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:15,041
I guess not.

97
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:17,291
She ate my breakfast
seaweed this morning.

98
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:18,666
[FEMALE STUDENT 6E]
What, they're fighting?

99
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:19,750
[MALE STUDENT 6A]
Are they gonna break up?

100
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:20,875
That's enough, guys!

101
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:23,416
Kanade Takahashi
Talk Time is over.

102
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,291
We're going to move on
to the topic at hand:

103
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,250
the sports festival.

104
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:29,291
By majority decision,

105
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:31,291
for this year's sports festival,

106
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:33,250
we have elected
to play dodge ball.

107
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:37,166
I'm sick of stinkin'
dodge ball. Boo.

108
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:38,708
Well, too bad for you.

109
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:40,958
Some students in this
room have matured so fast

110
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:43,125
that their physical prowess
differs from the rest of us,

111
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:45,333
so they're just going
to have to suck it up.

112
00:05:45,416 --> 00:05:46,333
Yeah.

113
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:48,166
I guess you are
at a disadvantage.

114
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:49,291
Height-wise, I mean.

115
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:50,541
[KAZ]
How dare you?!

116
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:52,625
I'm well on my way into
my second growth period!

117
00:05:52,708 --> 00:05:54,416
There's no need to be hateful!

118
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,708
You apologize
to Kaz immediately!

119
00:05:56,791 --> 00:05:58,166
That's right, apologize!

120
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:00,458
Apologize, apologize, apologize!

121
00:06:00,541 --> 00:06:03,333
You're the worst, ever, Kanade!

122
00:06:03,416 --> 00:06:04,666
Calm down, everyone.

123
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,416
There's no reason to be angry.

124
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,250
Pardon me for
losing my composure.

125
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:10,000
It was terribly juvenile.

126
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:11,541
How embarrassing.

127
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:13,916
It appears as though I don't
only need to grow in my height.

128
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,500
My patience could use some
more development, as well.

129
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:18,208
Oh my gah, he's so cool!

130
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:20,750
Oh, Master Kaz,
you're so grown-up and cool!

131
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:23,541
[GIN] That's a five-year
class president for you.

132
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:27,125
He'll probably be our future
student council president, too.

133
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:28,541
As for me,

134
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:31,000
I am destined to take over
my family's OBGYN practice

135
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:33,166
and provide exams to
all the girls in this class,

136
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:35,250
eventually guiding
them through childbirth!

137
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:36,375
[FEMALE STUDENTS]
Gross!

138

your backpack again!

139

Got it!

140
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:43,791
[TOM] Man, those girls
were super mad at you

141
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:46,333
in today's class
meeting, weren't they?

142
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:47,666
[KANADE]
I guess,

143
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,375
but I don't care if those
girls like me or not.

144
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:51,083
[GIN] You know, lately
I've gotten so used

145
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:52,541
to being called gross

146
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:54,291
it's actually starting
to feel awesome.

147
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:55,375
Seriously?

148
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:57,375
I really want the
girls to like me!

149
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:59,000

150
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:02,250
Yeah, you should give that
up as long as Kaz is around.

What's the deal?

155
00:07:06,541 --> 00:07:07,791
Why didn't you tell us your
cousin was still in town,

156
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:08,958
Kanade?

157
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:10,541
[KANADE] So, my cousin
is still in town.

158
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:11,791

Huh?

159

for ya all day, Kanade!

spirit into ya, y'know?

161
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:19,958
Uh no, I don't know.

162
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:22,750
Well, if you're a man,
you can't go makin' Kaho darlin'

163
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:25,125
cry like that, ya hear me?

164
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:28,083
So I'mma teach you
a valuable lesson.

165
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:30,333
You ready to lose
a tennis match to me?

166
00:07:33,416 --> 00:07:35,833
[KANADE] You wanna start
a fight? 'Cuz I'll finish it!

167
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:37,583
Bring it on, Brother!

168
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:40,291
[JOJI]
Careful what ya wish for!

169
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:41,791
Hi-yah!

170
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:49,375
Hey, I have no idea how
I should be keeping score.

171
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:50,375
Neither do I.

172
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:51,875
But fear not, my friend.

173
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:53,666
This battle of theirs
has gone far beyond

174
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,791
the concept of points.

175
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:56,750
[KANADE]
Here it comes!

176
00:07:56,833 --> 00:07:58,000
My killer move!

177
00:07:58,083 --> 00:08:01,750
[recorder playing]

178
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:05,583
[KANADE]
The Tornado Serve of Destiny!

179
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:10,916
[JOJI] Nice trick droppin' my
guard by playing purty music

180
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,708
on your recorder there.

181
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:15,375
I shoulda' been prepared
for somethin' like that.

182
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:16,916
But it ain't no thang.

183
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,916
I'll just sack this here ball
back to ya faster than ever!

184
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Best get ready,

185
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:24,208
'cause my Ballsack Serve
is comin' atcha!

186
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:28,166
[KANADE groans]

187
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:33,375
Well, d'ya learn your lesson?

188
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:35,958
Y'ain't never gonna beat me,
and now ya know it.

189
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:39,000
Trust I got too good a handle
on your weaknesses, cousin!

190
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:40,833
[KANADE]
Weaknesses?

191
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:42,916
I don't have any
weaknesses, bro!

192
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Take it back!

193
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:45,375
[JOJI]
Fess up!

194
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:47,916
Ya once promised a girl
you'd marry her, didn't ya?

195
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,250
[KANADE]
That's news to me!

196
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:51,791
[JOJI] It's fact.
Ya said the words, "Marry me!"

197
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:53,708
[KANADE]
I totally didn't do that.

198
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:56,125
[JOJI]
Did, too. I heard it myself.

199
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:57,166
[KANADE]
When?

200
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:58,708
What hour, what minute,
what second,

201
00:08:58,791 --> 00:09:00,916
how many times had the
Earth turned around, huh?

202
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,291
[JOJI] I'd say it turned about
twenty thousand times or so!

203
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:04,833
--[KANADE] What hour was it?
--[JOJI] Happy hour!

204
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:06,500
This battle's kind
of impressing me.

205
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:09,416
D'you say depressing?
Because I agree.

206
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,458
[KANADE, JOJI panting]

207
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:17,958
I tell ya what, ya give
purty good, Kanade.

208
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:19,416
You, too, Brother.

209
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:26,125
[JOJI]
Still gotta say, though...

210
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:27,875
It ain't becomin' in
the least to go and forget

211
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:29,708
all about your betrothed.

212
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:31,000
You're confused.

213
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:32,541
Nothing you say makes sense.

214
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:34,125
Dude, ya proposed to Yukie!

215
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:36,291
You know, my ma!

216
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,291
Yeah, but that was
when I was a kid.

217
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:44,791
[JOJI] Well, guess I got to
know your manly spirit better

218
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,250
with that tennis match!

219
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:47,625
Not that it matters none.

220
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:48,791
You're still failing big time

221
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:50,375
when it comes to
bein' a boyfriend.

222
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:51,666
I'm failing?

223
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,083
Not your fault.
It's like ya just don't

224
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:55,333
understand a woman's heart.

225
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:56,791
Heard that before.

226
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:59,208
The girls in my class
say the same thing.

227
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:01,083
Maybe women are
just really angry people.

228
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:03,166
Namiko's always in my
face about dirty dishes

229
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:04,875
and using too much shampoo.

230
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:08,416
I don't get women at all.

231
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,541
Well, from what
I've been told,

232
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:12,083
they're all really complicated.

233
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:14,166
You know, kinda like
figuring out fractions.

234
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:16,083
[ARASHI] Are we speaking
of a woman's heart?

235
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:20,375
I can certainly help you
learn more about that, boys.

236
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:26,666
[ARASHI]
And with that...

237
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,791
Top-secret mission!

238
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:30,708
This meeting of the Women's
Heart Research team

239
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:32,625
is now in session!

240
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:34,500
[KANADE]
I can feel air on my butt!

241
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:36,416
I still don't get how
this is gonna help us

242
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,916
understand a woman's heart.

243
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,250
I reckon dressin' up like
this is the best way, though.

244
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:42,291
I mean, how ya gonna know
what women hafta go through

245
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:44,250
unless you're actually
tryna be one?

246
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:46,958
Now... It's time for you to
take your shot, young man.

247
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:48,166
Tee-hee.

248
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:49,875
[TOM]
I think Joji may be right.

249
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:53,791
Wow, I can't believe I'm already
starting to know women better!

250
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:55,958
Fair Gin's channeling
full-throttle!

251
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:58,875
The surging cosmic radio
waves are leaving a tingle

252
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:00,666
throughout my entire body!

253
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,625
[ARASHI moaning]

254
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:04,333
You guys look amazing!

255
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:07,125
Ah! Glorious! Just wonderful!

256
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,791
To think I'd have the chance to
see my secret stash of costumes

257
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:11,750
come to life like this!

258
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:13,666
[KOTA] Hold on...
If I could have a moment...

259
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:17,916
This also has absolutely
nothing to do with me, right?

260
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,791
So why... why me?

261
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:21,166
You're killing it!

262
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:23,666
Those tears in your
eyes are gold!

263
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,458
The rest of us
are here, too!

264
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:27,166
For real. What about
taking our pictures?

265
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,583
Whoa. This must be
how insecure feels.

266
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:31,875
Check out Miss Kota,
hoarding all of the praise!

267
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:32,958
[KOTA]
Don't get mad at me!

268
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:34,833
I didn't ask him
to praise anything!

269
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:36,250
[ARASHI]
It's okay.

270
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:39,041
You can't help that pretty face
or how charming you look

271
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:40,625
when you're embarrassed!

272
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:42,875
Like the boys over there,
most guys put a skirt on

273
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:45,375
and get over their nervousness
almost immediately.

274
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:47,625
They're just clothes, after all.

275
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:48,916
Oh, that's gotta hurt!

276
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,041
Kanade has grabbed
Joji's back in a cobra twist

277
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:52,875
and is, in fact, twisting.

278
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:55,708
Joji is handling it well by
staying close to the ground!

279
00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:56,833
[KANADE yells]

280
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,000
[TOM] Kanade's been flipped
in a figure-four hold!

281
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:01,291
But not for long.

282
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:03,000
No way Joji's stopping here!

283
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:05,125
It's the Tickler Grip!

284
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:08,041
Poor Kanade! That's gotta
tickle so bad it hurts!

285
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:09,958
[KANADE laughing]

286
00:12:12,375 --> 00:12:13,500
[JOJI]
You're up, kid!

287
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:18,541
And, both wrestlers have been
replaced with their teammates.

288
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:19,916
Ooh! Big move!

289
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,125
Tom catches Gin in a scissor
sweep right off the bat.

290
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:25,750
And now, he's movin'
into an electric massage!

291
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:31,333
[NARRATOR] The electric
massage is a secret,

292
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:35,458
forbidden technique
in elementary-school kung fu.

293
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:38,458
Its history dates back to
before the common era,

294
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:40,875
when, while wrestling in
an ancient Olympics,

295
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:44,458
one "Elektros Masáz" began
persistently massaging

296
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:47,541
his opponent's crotch
with his foot.

297
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:50,166
Even now, its mix
of pleasure and danger

298
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:51,875
give the move a strong following

299
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:54,916
as the ultimate
"skinship" between boys.

300
00:12:57,583 --> 00:12:59,958
[ARASHI] C'mon, your clothes
are going to get all wrinkled.

301
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:02,125
That's enough wrestling.
Please stop!

302
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:03,250
So, um...

303
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:05,833
I'm gonna go back to
my room now, okay?

304
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:07,083
What? Already?

305
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:08,333
Aw, ya can't go yet.

306
00:13:08,416 --> 00:13:10,333
Don't be such a girl.
Have some fun!

307
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:12,458
No, thanks. Just because
it's fun for you

308
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:15,875
doesn't mean that it's fun
for everyone else.

309
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:18,250
You can really hurt a person
by forcing your ideas

310
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:21,083
or plans on them.
It feels like you don't care.

311
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:23,208
[KAHO] I don't wanna be forced
to share the time we spend

312
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:24,708
together playing with Joji,

313
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:27,375
and you should have
asked me about that.

314
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:28,958
I don't like doing this.

315
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:30,875
It's not fun for me at all!

316
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:32,708
Why didn't you just say no?

317
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:34,333
Hey, in a sense,

318
00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:37,916
I feel as if he's got more of a
woman's heart than any of us do.

00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,166
[KANADE]
Of course she's mad.

320
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:40,833
I remember now.

321
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:42,708
Something else
my mom told me.

322
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:45,333
Don't ever force someone to do
what they don't want to do.

323
00:13:45,416 --> 00:13:46,208
Ever.

324
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:48,041
If Kota isn't having fun,

325
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:49,625
we shouldn't try to
make him play with us

326
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:50,791
if he doesn't like it.

[JOJI]
I get that.

328
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:55,375
Real grown up, Kanade!

00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:57,333
[ARASHI]
But he looked so adorable!

330
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:04,791
Why do those committee
meetings always run so long?

[Well then quit
being a baby about it!

much, take it off already.

I see London, I see France!

Oh, no!

336
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:22,583
I'll never get married now!

337
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:26,166
I guess they must
all be upstairs.

338
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:27,416
I wonder why.

339
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,875
Okay, where are they?

My apologies, Miss!

Kaho!

Did you see that girl?
She just ran down the stairs.

[KAHO]
No, I didn't see a girl.

I didn't see anyone.

But she was right here.

[KAHO]
What did you need with her?

I, uh... I don't exactly know.

want to see her again.

So badly. So badly, I'm shaking.

00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:50,583
I wanna know why she
was crying. Can I help?

And stupidly enough,
it's all I can think about.

363
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:55,291
What is this thing
that I'm feeling?

364
00:16:00,416 --> 00:16:04,041
You're small,
but you are pretty cute.

365
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:07,750
[KAHO] Sounds to me
like it's your first love.

366
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:09,500
My first love?

367
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:10,583
Mm-hmm.

368
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,541
I recognize what
you're describing,

369
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:15,083
because that's pretty
much how I felt

370
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:18,041
the first time
that I met Kanade.

371

I understand now.

372

That girl is my very first love.

Forgive me. I seem
to have fallen in love.

[KAZ] Yes, with the owner
of this poetry journal.

379

I do believe her tears and pure
heart have changed me forever.

Sounds good to me.

Goodness gracious, it's time
for your tutoring, Mister!

Okay!

[MAFUYU] You need to
change clothes first, though.

What are you even wearing?

Shugo will never trust
me to tutor you again

in that fashion disaster.

Ooh! Give yourself a punishment!

When she watches
you overcome it,

that should prove to
her how serious you are.

You could punish me.

Oh, yeah!
Get angry, Shugo!

He thinks we need to talk?

439

In a good way or a bad way?

440
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:30,625
Who am I kidding?
It's never in a good way.

441
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:33,541
So I've been thinking
a lot, like, about you.

442
00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:38,125
And, you know, about like what
a good man is supposed to be.

443
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:39,958
I've decided to
hula-hoop for you.

444
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:41,375
Two hundred rotations.

445
00:19:41,458 --> 00:19:43,333
Sorry, what?

446
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:45,291
[KANADE] It's to punish
myself for not being able

447
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:48,958
to understand how
the woman I love feels.

448
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:51,250
Did he say the woman he loves?

449
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:52,750
Is that me?

450
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:55,958
My current record
is 175 rotations.

451
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:58,375
If I make it to 200,
will you please forgive me

452
00:19:58,458 --> 00:19:59,875
for being stupid yesterday?

453
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:03,125
You know, because you respect
my manly spirit and all?

454
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:05,583
[KAHO]
Are you serious?

455
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:07,708
I will do this. I will.

456
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:10,375
I don't want to let you
go without trying.

457
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:22,958
[KAHO] This is so surreal,
but go for it, Kanade.

458
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:52,875
[KAHO]
You're almost at 200!

So close!

00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:55,875
You can do it, Kanade.

461
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:57,291
You can do it!

462
00:20:57,375 --> 00:21:01,291
195, 196, 197...

...it's over.

[KANADE]
My heart is a drumbeat!

I may not be able to see, but I
can still drum like a rock star!

00:23:11,916 --> 00:23:13,791
What a filthy Cinderella!

468
00:23:13,875 --> 00:23:15,625
You disgust me.

469
00:23:15,708 --> 00:23:17,958
Oh, Detective!

470
00:23:18,041 --> 00:23:21,750
I can't hear you!
Again, with feeling!

00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:23,083
Yes, Professor, sir!

00:23:23,166 --> 00:23:24,875
I am just a clumsy,
slow, and stupid
