1
00:00:18,375 --> 00:00:19,666
[KAHO]
It's morning.

2
00:00:27,291 --> 00:00:29,291
[KAHO]
No matter how dark the night,

3
00:00:29,375 --> 00:00:30,875
morning will always come.

4
00:00:30,958 --> 00:00:31,916
[alarm ringing]

5
00:00:36,583 --> 00:00:39,958
[knocking]

6
00:00:40,041 --> 00:00:41,458
[KAHO]
Just a second!

7
00:00:43,208 --> 00:00:44,291
[KANADE]
Yo!

8
00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:45,625
You down for some breakfast?

9
00:00:45,708 --> 00:00:47,500
[KAHO]
Oh, yes! I'm d--uh...

10
00:00:47,583 --> 00:00:48,500
I'll be right there.

11
00:00:48,583 --> 00:00:49,625
Cool! Hurry!

12
00:00:52,625 --> 00:00:53,708
[KAHO]
I didn't think about that.

13
00:00:53,791 --> 00:00:55,208
We live under the same roof,

14
00:00:55,291 --> 00:00:57,083
so we'll probably see each other
first thing in the morning

15
00:00:57,166 --> 00:00:58,458
all the time.

16
00:01:02,125 --> 00:01:03,625
I should let you know...

17
00:01:03,708 --> 00:01:06,750
It's nothing personal, but I'm
against you and Kanade dating.

18
00:01:09,958 --> 00:01:11,125
[KAHO]
He should be.

19
00:01:11,208 --> 00:01:14,041
I'm against me dating
a fifth grader, too.

20
00:01:14,125 --> 00:01:15,625
What am I going to do?

21
00:01:24,625 --> 00:01:25,833
[SHUGO]
Good morning!

22
00:01:25,916 --> 00:01:27,750
You must be Miss Nikaido.

23
00:01:27,833 --> 00:01:28,750
[KAHO]
Oh! Yes.

24
00:01:28,833 --> 00:01:31,000
But please call me Kaho.

25
00:01:31,083 --> 00:01:33,000
Sorry for not
greeting you earlier.

26
00:01:33,083 --> 00:01:35,083
I'm your landlord,
Shugo Takahashi.

27
00:01:36,958 --> 00:01:39,208
[KAHO]
Takahashi? Wait a minute...

28
00:01:39,291 --> 00:01:41,875
[KAHO] Are you related
to Kanade, by chance?

29
00:01:41,958 --> 00:01:43,750
Yeah. I'm his dad.

30
00:01:43,833 --> 00:01:45,541
[KAHO]
Of course he is.

31
00:01:45,625 --> 00:01:48,750
[recorder playing]

32
00:01:48,833 --> 00:01:50,583
[KOTA]
Kanade, please knock it off!

33
00:01:50,666 --> 00:01:52,833
Sorry, but he's always
loud in the morning.

34
00:01:52,916 --> 00:01:55,041
No, it's totally fine.

35
00:01:55,125 --> 00:01:56,750
He's always been
a rambunctious one.

36
00:01:56,833 --> 00:01:58,958
But after his mom died
a couple of years back,

37
00:01:59,041 --> 00:02:01,208
he started to become a
handful, to say the least.

38
00:02:01,291 --> 00:02:02,666
C'mon, Shinohara.

39
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:04,958
Just act like you're
awake so he'll quit.

40
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:05,958
[KOTA]
Look, I'm up!

41
00:02:06,041 --> 00:02:07,833
Stop! I'm getting
a headache now!

42
00:02:07,916 --> 00:02:09,916
Just try to think of him
as your little brother,

43
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,791
and play with him
every now and then.

44
00:02:11,875 --> 00:02:13,916
Yeah, of course.

45
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,125
[KAHO] Not like I can
tell you he's my boyfriend.

46
00:02:16,208 --> 00:02:18,833
So sure, he might as well
be my little brother, too.

47
00:02:18,916 --> 00:02:20,833
Why stop the weird now?

48
00:02:20,916 --> 00:02:21,875
[groans]

49
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,291
[KAHO]
Um... hello?

50
00:04:03,375 --> 00:04:05,166
You must be Kaho, right?

51
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:06,916
Oh, you're so cute!

52
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,291
Who's the cutest cutie?

53
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:10,208
You are! Yes, you are!

54
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:11,416
Such a cutie!

55
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,583
Behind you!

56
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,250
[ARASHI yells]

57
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:17,791
Except for the fact that
Chiaki's the cutiest cutie

58
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:19,250
in the whole entire world!

59
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:20,208
[KAHO]
What?

60
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:22,208
I have no idea what's going on!

61
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:24,625
FYI, that's Arashi Nagasawa.

62
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:26,375
He's a grad student
and just happens to be

63
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:27,875
Chiaki's boyfriend.

64
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:30,416
[ARASHI groaning]

65
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,083
You know there's a punishment
when your eyes stray like that.

66
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:34,625
[KAHO]
So they're together?

67
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:40,291
[KAHO]
Thank you for the food!

68
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:43,958
[KAHO]
Hey. What's up?

69
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:46,333
Can I have your seaweed?

70
00:04:46,416 --> 00:04:47,625
'Kay. Here.

71
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:49,250
[KANADE]
Thank you!

72
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:50,666
Yo, Kota, I want yours, too.

73
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,750
Well I already ate all of it!

74
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:53,916
[KANADE]
Greedy!

75
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,208
How about you, Arashi?

76
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:56,833
Yeah, sure.
I'll take your seaweed.

77
00:04:56,916 --> 00:04:58,916
[KANADE]
No, that's not what I meant.

78
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,875
Sit down and stop begging.

79
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:01,750
But I--

80
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:03,500
One seaweed packet per person.

81
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:04,583
Understand me?

82
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:05,875
[KANADE]
Fine.

83
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:07,125
[KAHO giggles]

84
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:09,875
Kanade must really love
seaweed to beg for it.

85
00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:11,333
So adorable!

86
00:05:11,416 --> 00:05:14,166
[SHUGO]
Oh, that's right, Miss Kaho...

87
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:15,291
[KAHO]
Yes?

88
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:16,875
I can't believe I forgot.

89
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:19,750
I haven't explained the ins and
outs of the House to you yet.

90
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:21,250
[KAHO]
No.

91
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:23,666
[TAGA] I can take care of that
later if you'd like me to.

92
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:26,291
[SHUGO]
Yeah, thanks. That'd be great.

93
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:28,916
[KAHO] Well, thank you
in advance, Taga.

94
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:36,500
[KAHO] Wow, he really
seems like he's a nice guy.

95
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:41,166
[KANADE] So tell me. What do
people do when they're dating?

96
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:43,125
Come on! You gotta know!

97
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:44,625
[KAHO]
I'm going to die!

98
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:46,041
How can he just
shout that out...

99
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:48,000
Whoa, where on Earth
did that come from?

100
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:49,625
Well, actually...

101
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:51,208
[KAHO]
This is the end!

102
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:52,750
I bet I know.

103
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:55,666
He's been watching a lot
of those soap operas lately.

104
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:56,625
[SHUGO]
Of course.

105
00:05:56,708 --> 00:05:58,041
The brain rotting TV again.

106
00:05:58,125 --> 00:05:59,458
[KAHO]
Oh, good.

107
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:01,000
Wait a sec...

108
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:04,750
Did Taga's covering
for us actually work?

109
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:06,291
[KANADE]
Wait, I know.

110
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:09,208
Arashi, you're dating Chiaki,
so you gotta do something.

111
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:11,333
What do you guys do?

112
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:13,500
Well, I call her
every morning, and...

113
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:14,958
Call her?

114
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,083
[ARASHI] Yeah, I call her
when I leave the house, too.

115
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:19,250
Why? Can you not just text her?

116
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:20,916
[ARASHI] Because when
you're dating someone,

117
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,791
you want to hear their voice!

118
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:26,416
However, it doesn't seem
to matter much recently

119
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,625
considering I've been on
Chiaki's rejection list.

120
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:29,750
I wonder why!

121
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:31,666
Kinda creepy to call
me 90 times a day

122
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,708
when we, uh...
live in the same building!

123
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:35,083
I can't help myself, though.

124
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:36,708
I get all of three
feet away from you

125
00:06:36,791 --> 00:06:38,750
and then immediately miss
the sound of your voice!

126
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:40,500
[CHIAKI] You get five
calls max from now on.

127
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:43,416
Okay, okay.
Five times for my baby!

128
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,208
Kanade. Arashi is not
a decent role model.

129
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:47,750
Please don't listen to him.

130
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:50,250
Okay. Then you tell me, Kota.

131
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:51,625
[KOTA gasps]
Who, me?

132
00:06:51,708 --> 00:06:54,541
Well, you... you can, uh...
hold hands, I guess?

133
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:58,291
[CHIAKI] Kanade, asking a virgin
deluxe is even more useless.

134
00:06:58,375 --> 00:06:59,000
[KANADE]
Virgin?

135
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:00,250
[KOTA]
No!

136
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:02,208
Don't make fun. That has
nothing to do with this!

137
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:04,541
But regardless,
you are a virgin, aren't you?

138
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:07,458
Hey, Kaho.

139
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:11,500
What's a virgin?

140
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:12,750
Young man!

141
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:14,750
That is not a question
you should ask a lady.

142
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:16,000
Eat your food, now!

143
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:19,000
[KANADE] Why won't you tell me?
You're so mean!

144
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:20,708
More importantly,

145
00:07:20,791 --> 00:07:22,333
I thought I heard you were
supposed to hang out

146
00:07:22,416 --> 00:07:24,250
with Gin and Tom this morning?

147
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:25,500
[KANADE]
Oh, that's right!

148
00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:36,625
[TAGA] The landlord
usually makes our meals,

149
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:38,583
so just be sure to let
him know whenever you

150
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:39,750
decide to opt out.

151
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:40,958
[KAHO]
Right.

152
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:42,208
[TAGA] We have free
reign of the kitchen,

153
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:43,666
but make sure you
don't eat anything

154
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,166
without getting
permission first.

155
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:47,458
Oh, and if you keep
anything in the fridge,

156
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:49,416
put your name on it,
or it'll be gone.

157
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,416
Snacks or whatnot.

158
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,041
Okay.

159
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:55,291
[TAGA] As for the bath,
this is the schedule.

160
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:58,791
Write your name next to
whatever bathtime you'd like.

161
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:00,791
And yes, the bathroom
door does lock.

162
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:01,875
[KAHO]
Great.

163
00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:03,500
I think that's
pretty much everything.

164
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,791
[KAHO] Thanks for doing this.
It was very kind of you.

165
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:08,750
Oh, no, it was nothing, really.

166
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:10,875
I almost forgot about
your welcome party!

167
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:12,666
What? A party?

168
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:13,875
[TAGA]
Of course.

169
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:16,041
We can have it in
my room later on today.

170
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:17,291
Yeah, okay.

171
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:18,791
That sounds great!

172
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:19,875
Wonderful!

173
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:21,583
We're all so happy
that you're here.

174
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:23,125
[KAHO]
Thank you so much.

175
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:24,416
[TAGA]
No problem. See ya later.

176
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,000
Yep. See you soon,
and thanks again!

177
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:30,291
[KAHO]
A welcome party?

178
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:33,708
It makes me a little nervous,
but it's so nice, too.

179
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:37,333
[SHUGO] Kaho, do you mind
putting those cardboard boxes

180
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:38,833
out by the trash?

181
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:40,458
No, I don't mind at all.

182
00:08:40,541 --> 00:08:41,666
[SHUGO]
I'll be back.

183
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,500
I've got a few errands to run.

184
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:45,541
'Kay. I'll see you in a while!

185
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:50,875
[KAHO] What would Kanade's
dad do if he found out

186
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:52,875
I was dating his son?

187
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:55,333
His fifth-grade son,
to be exact.

188
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:58,041
[CHIAKI]
Indecent much?

189
00:08:58,125 --> 00:08:59,291
Criminal? Maybe.

190
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:01,041
Perverted? Yeah.

191
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:04,125
[KAHO] Yeah, what he
doesn't know can't hurt me.

192
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:15,000
[KAHO squeals]

193
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:16,708
[KAHO]
What are you doing, Kanade?

194
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:18,833
Nothing! I like
upper arms, jeez!

195
00:09:18,916 --> 00:09:20,458
Did you have to
sneak up on me?

196
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:21,583
[KANADE]
Can't I?

197
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:23,208
Not if you scare me.

198
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:24,416
Not like that.

199
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,666
You're right,
'cause you're my girlfriend.

200
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,541
[KAHO]
He called me his girlfriend.

201
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:31,708
Oh my gosh.
I think I'm blushing!

202
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:34,541
I shouldn't be touching a girl
unless it's my girlfriend.

203
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:36,625
And only if it's okay with her.

204
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:38,875
That's what I was taught.

205
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:39,833
[KAHO]
By whom?

206
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:41,333
My mom, silly.

207
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:43,833
Your mom said that? Really?

208
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:44,916
[KANADE]
Yep!

209
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:49,875
[KAHO] I still can't believe
this considerate guy

210
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:52,333
is in elementary school.

211
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:53,583
[TOM]
Kanade!

212
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:56,500
We're here for some
eleph-fun! Whoo!

213
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:58,541
Mr. Elephant,
your trunk is so long!

214
00:09:58,625 --> 00:09:59,750
Long trunk!

215
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:02,416
Long trunk! Long wiener, too!

216
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,916
[ALL]
Long, long wiener, too!

217
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,750
Yay!

218
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:09,541
[KAHO] Or I totally believe
he's in elementary school.

219
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:11,583
[KANADE] Bamboo Primary's
jump rope competition

220
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:14,375
is early next week,
so we've gotta practice.

221
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:16,375
[KAHO]
Really? That sounds fun.

222
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:17,625
Uh-huh!

223
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:19,916
I'm gonna try to beat
the criss-cross record.

224
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,333
Criss-cross?

225
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:26,125
[NARRATOR] "Criss-cross"
is a highly difficult variation

226
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:27,500
on jumping rope,

227
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:29,708
wherein the jumper must
jump through the gap

228
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:32,291
formed where the
rope is crossed.

229
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:35,708
It is also called
double jump or speed jump

230
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:37,416
depending on the region.

231
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,666
Incidentally, we
have confirmed reports

232
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,750
that experiencing the
sting of a jump rope

233
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:44,875
against one's bare leg as
a child can directly lead

234
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:47,250
to increased
interest in masochism

235
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:48,958
upon reaching adulthood.

236
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,166
Trust me. I'm like
a criss-cross expert!

237
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,083
I can jump 30 times in a row!

238
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:57,166
I'll show you,
if you want me to!

239
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:59,916
[KAHO giggles]
Yeah. I'd love to see that.

240
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,625
I'm gonna practice
triple-unders until I own them!

241
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:03,958
Not me.

242
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:05,833
I'm gonna use my jump rope
to tie stuff up instead.

243
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:06,958
[KANADE]
What? Why?

244
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,333
Jumping is more fun!

245
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:12,708
Good morning, Kaho.

246
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:13,583
How're you?

247
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:14,750
[KAHO]
Fine, thanks.

248
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:16,666
Good morning.

249
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:19,291
Hey, you wanna
jump rope with us?

250
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:21,291
Well, uh...

251
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:22,625
[shrieks]

252
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:24,125
I would, but I still have
a lot of cleaning to do

253
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:26,333
after moving in and stuff, so...

254
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:27,541
Suit yourself.

255
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:29,208
But you should come
play when you're done!

256
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:30,250
[KAHO]
Yeah, I will.

257
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:31,666
For sure. When I'm done.

258
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,541
Now, off we go yodel-oh!

259
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:35,458
Now, off we godel-odel-oh.

260
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:37,250
Now, yodel-ay-pee-poo.

261
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:39,041
Later!

262
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:40,375
If you'll excuse us.

263
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:42,083
[KAHO]
Uh, yeah. Bye.

264
00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:44,375
[giggles]

265
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:47,250
[sighs]

266
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:49,375
[ARASHI]
Well, that was a big sigh.

267
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:56,333
[KAHO]
Um... is this okay?

268
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:57,416
Oh, don't worry.

269
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:00,000
I go for "pretty girls" anyway.

270
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:03,291
Yeah, to be specific,
I like boys dressed as girls.

271
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:06,375
So I guess you could
say pretty-girl boys.

272
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:07,500
Huh?

273
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:09,083
[ARASHI]
Like Li'l Renren!

274
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:10,291
You know him, right?

275
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:12,458
Come here.
This is what I'm talking about.

276
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:16,375
[ARASHI]
Oh!

277
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:19,958
This is my entire collection
of Li'l Renren merchandise!

278
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:21,375
[laughing]

279
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:23,000
Ooh!

280
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:24,583
Oh.

281
00:12:24,666 --> 00:12:26,541
It's so nice you have a hobby
you can devote yourself to.

282
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:28,083
I know, right?
I'm the luckiest ever!

283
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:29,666
OMG. I can't stand it!

284
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:32,166
Isn't Li'l Renren adorable?
I could lick them all over!

285
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:33,541
A little tee-hee right here.

286
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:35,291
A little ooh-hoo right there
where they're ticklish.

287
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:37,041
Oh, my fantasies
are in overdrive!

288
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:38,916
I'm breathless!

289
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:42,375
Oh oh oh oh!

290
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:43,416
I'm sorry.

291
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,708
Forgot myself for a sec.

292
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:46,500
You must be so scandalized.

293
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:49,083
[ARASHI]
You know what's great, though?

294
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:53,083
Chiaki still accepts me
just the way I am.

295
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:54,625
You understand, don't you?

296
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:56,500
Seems like you've got a
big enough heart to accept

297
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:59,958
your boyfriend exactly
the way he is, too.

298
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:01,666
But he's in the fifth grade.

299
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:04,083
[ARASHI] What is that,
a five-year age difference?

300
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:07,250
You know, Chiaki and I happen
to be five years apart, as well.

301
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:09,291
In the end, age has
nothing to do with it.

302
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:11,416
All you need is love.

303
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,541
That's it?

304
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,750
[ARASHI]
Yes, love! Love!

305
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:18,625
[KAHO]
I don't know.

306
00:13:18,708 --> 00:13:21,625
It seems as if a loser
like me has no excuse

307
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:23,791
for being Kanade's girlfriend.

308
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:26,291
Seriously? Look, Kaho.

309
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:28,958
I feel like calling yourself a
loser is pretty rude to Chiaki

310
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:30,416
who accepts me this way,

311
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,541
but what do you think that
statement says about Kanade?

312
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:36,083
[KANADE] I heard if you call
yourself a loser too much,

313
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:38,083
you'll actually
wind up becoming one.

314
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,958
[KAHO]
He's right.

315
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:43,416
Plus, Kanade accepted
me the way I am

316
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,041
without even flinching.

317
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:49,541
Maybe I should just accept
him the way he is, too.

318
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:53,208
[KAHO] Arashi Nagasawa.
He's so sweet.

319
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:57,125
I hope I can repay him
for this advice one day.

320
00:13:57,208 --> 00:13:59,166
I'm going to head
back to my room now.

your help with every--

Oh...!

My Li'l Renren! Squee!

324
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:08,708
You're so frikkin cute!

My live on-the-air
costume change!

326
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:13,166
That's right after
these messages!

327
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:14,291
[ARASHI screams]

328
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:19,250
Just kidding!

329
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:21,250
Aren't I the worst?

330
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:23,666
[ARASHI whining]

331
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,958
[KAHO]
Finally made it!

332
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:30,250
They're gone?

333
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:35,250
[KANADE] Maybe to you,
but it's super precious to me.

334
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:36,750
[KAHO]
What are they talking about?

335
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:39,625
I wonder what could be
so precious to Kanade.

336
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:41,083
What is that old saying?

337
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:43,208
Joined at the something. Uh... 

338
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:45,250
I know! It's joined at the nip!

339
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:48,250
Tom, what Kanade's thinking
of is "joined at the hip."

340
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:50,916
Yeah, joined at the hip!
That's what I was thinking of!

341
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,833
[KAHO]
Do I wanna know?

342
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:54,125
[GIN]
What if this precious treasure

343
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:56,000
suddenly went away tomorrow?

344
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:58,541
We need to have a
plan just in case, guys.

345
00:14:58,625 --> 00:14:59,666
Yeah, shut up, man.

346
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:02,166
Why're you trying to scare us?

347
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:03,541
Just think.

348
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:05,083
You love it so much,
it could poke you in the butt

349
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:06,250
and you won't care.

350
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:08,416
"Eye." Could poke
you in the "eye."

351
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,666
I'm pretty sure that's
what he means, so...

352
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,166
Ah!

353
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:14,125
What's wrong with you, Gin?
That would really hurt bad!

354
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:16,458
So true! Eye or butt, bad!

355
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:17,791
[KAHO]
Hey, guys!

356
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:20,333
You seem to be having a
very serious conversation.

357
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:21,916
What are you talking about?

358
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,791
We're talking about our
most precious partners!

359
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:25,875
Partners?

360
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:27,125
[KANADE]
Hold up!

361
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:28,833
We shouldn't talk about
this in front of Kaho.

362
00:15:28,916 --> 00:15:29,875
He's right.

363
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:31,250
We can discuss this
some other time.

364
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:32,833
[KAHO]
Oh.

365
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:36,000
Kanade's hiding something that
he feels like he can't tell me.

366
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:37,583
Hey, I'm really sorry.

367
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:41,291
It's just that none of us
want to be mean to you.

368
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:44,000
Because you're the only
one here without one.

369
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:45,666
A wiener, obviously.

370
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:49,250
Hey! There's a lady present.

371
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:51,208
We need to stop talking
about this right now!

372
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:54,000
What? I don't get it.
Stop talking about what?

373
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:55,291
[KAZ]
No more beep stuff.

374
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:56,875
Huh? I can't hear you.

375
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:58,958
[KAZ] Beep stuff!
Words that get beeped!

376
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,791
Nothing we're saying
should get beeped!

377
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:03,041
Come on, man, step up
and shout out "wiener"

378
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:04,375
like the rest of us do!

379
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:06,083
[KAZ]
I will do no such thing!

380
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:08,833
I'd give you one if
there was a way I could.

381
00:16:08,916 --> 00:16:10,458
I only have one, though.

382
00:16:10,541 --> 00:16:11,500
I'm sorry.

383
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:12,625
You would love it.

384
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:14,375
Wieners are the
best things ever.

385
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:15,875
[KAHO]
Nope. I'm good!

386
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:17,208
I don't want one!

387
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:18,375
Not at all!

388
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:21,583
[BOYS]
You don't want one?!

389
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:23,625
How can you say that
when our precious wieners

390
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:25,875
mean everything to us?!

391
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:27,333
So... was I wrong?

392
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:29,458
Because I really believed
that you of all people

393
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:32,041
would accept this
treasure we hold so dear.

394
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:33,916
But instead you
don't want a wiener,

395
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,583
and you didn't even have
to think about it first!

00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:37,750
[KAHO]
What on Earth?

397
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:40,000
Why does that upset
Kanade so much?

398
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:41,750
Uhh, actually...

399
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:43,750
I do want a wiener, Kanade!

400
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:45,291
I do want one!

401
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:49,458
Of course you do!

402
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:56,166
[KAHO] Did I just say what I'm
pretty sure I think I just said?

403
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:59,333
On the bright side, at least
they're all smiling again.

[KAHO]
You know what?

00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:07,875
I just realized that I never
got the chance to see you

Well, I'm finished

the park later.

Nice timing, Kanade.

A ten-spot ladybug? Cool!

her before she gets away!

Yeah. Yeah, that he is.

so much over one little ladybug!

Oh. Sure.

chip in for the party?

Oh, no.

back in my room.

I'm gonna go grab it.
I'll be right back.

00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:30,625
Are you really that stupid?

You just waltzed
right in to the room

00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:41,416
There is no welcome
party, idiot. Nothing.

442
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,625
You're a sheltered princess

who's never known
hardship before.

444
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:46,958
People like you make me sick.

445
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:49,583
And falling for Kanade
proves how stupid you are.

446
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:51,125
Don't pretend
you haven't fallen.

447
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:54,166
Getting all nervous and
flushed are a major tell.

448
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:55,791
You're strangely assertive.

449
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:57,625
And that makes me hate you more.

450

[FRIEND 2A] But Mom says I can't
come to your birthday party.

00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:02,833
I know I promised you
that I would,

00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:04,708
but I have to take it back.

453
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:08,458
Mom said our families belong
to different social classes,

454
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:11,041
and that means I
shouldn't play with you.

00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:12,291
As if anyone would welcome

This ladybug wasn't
even a little big, you jerk!

00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:40,250
And it only has
seven spots, not ten!

Ah.

Well, my bad.

Okay, then why did you hit me?

You're making my

I'm just protecting her.

Don't make your girlfriend cry.
You gotta protect her.

Well, now what do I do?

What does that mean?

479
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:12,916
[GIN, TOM]
Yeah, we wanna know, too!

480
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,875
Tell us what a virgin is!

481
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:16,375
Gah!

482
00:22:16,458 --> 00:22:19,666
Why is my virginity such a big
deal to everyone now, huh?

483
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:21,833
[TAGA]
I can tell you what it means.

484
00:22:21,916 --> 00:22:25,208
This virginity Kota possesses
is a fantastic thing.

485
00:22:25,291 --> 00:22:26,708
[BOYS]
Huh?!

486
00:22:26,791 --> 00:22:29,750
If he keeps it safe, he could
become a mage of sorts.

487
00:22:29,833 --> 00:22:31,291
He could become a mage?

488
00:22:31,375 --> 00:22:33,166
[TAGA]
Yes, and having had no attempts

489
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:36,041
on his virginity thus far,
Kota here is a pure virgin.

490
00:22:36,125 --> 00:22:37,375
The king of virgins,
if you will.

491
00:22:37,458 --> 00:22:39,083
[KANADE, GIN, TOM]
No way! Awesome!

492
00:22:39,166 --> 00:22:41,041
Calm down!
It is not awesome.

493
00:22:41,125 --> 00:22:42,916
In fact, I'd throw
it away if I could.

494
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,375
[KANADE, GIN, TOM]
You'd throw it away?

495
00:22:44,458 --> 00:22:46,125
If you don't want it,
give that thing to me.

496
00:22:46,208 --> 00:22:48,416
[KOTA] Nope.
No, I'm not gonna do that.

497
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:51,125
Hey, that's not fair!
What if I want Kota's virginity?

498
00:22:51,208 --> 00:22:53,375
[KOTA] Well, you
can't have it, Kanade!

499
00:22:53,458 --> 00:22:55,041
Cool. Does that mean
I get it, then?

500
00:22:55,125 --> 00:22:56,875
No, not you either!

501
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:58,875
Hold on. What is going on here?

502
00:22:58,958 --> 00:23:00,500
[KAZ]
It's unclear.

503
00:23:00,583 --> 00:23:03,166
Is a virginity worth getting
so worked up over?

504
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:04,416
Oh! If so,

505
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:07,416
does that mean you
want to be a virgin, Kaz?

506
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,625
Yes! Let's all be virgins!

507
00:23:09,708 --> 00:23:11,583
Virgins forever!

508
00:23:11,666 --> 00:23:13,000
Spoiler alert.

509
00:23:13,958 --> 00:23:15,375
You guys are already virgins.

510
00:23:15,458 --> 00:23:16,708
[BOYS]
Huh?!

511
00:23:16,791 --> 00:23:19,750
[BOYS chattering, laughing]

512
00:23:20,875 --> 00:23:22,041
I think I should
use this moment

513
00:23:22,125 --> 00:23:25,458
to come out of the proverbial
shadows myself.

514
00:23:25,541 --> 00:23:27,458
I'm totally a virgin, too.

515
00:23:27,541 --> 00:23:28,541
[ALL]
What?

516
00:23:28,625 --> 00:23:30,041
[KOTA]
But you have a girlfriend!

517
00:23:30,125 --> 00:23:32,541
[ARASHI] Chiaki's the
pretty girl that I love,

518
00:23:32,625 --> 00:23:36,291
but I only desire
pretty-girl boys!

519
00:23:36,375 --> 00:23:38,000
[ALL]
Awesome!

520
00:23:39,958 --> 00:23:41,541
[RENREN] Everyone's favorite
Renren here!

521
00:23:41,625 --> 00:23:43,541
Coming up on
<i>First Love Monster</i> :

522
00:23:43,625 --> 00:23:45,708
Blah blah blah blah,
primary school years,

523
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:47,750
blah blah blah,
Kasumi House, blah.

524
00:23:47,833 --> 00:23:49,083
All that and more!

525
00:23:49,166 --> 00:23:51,125
Next time: "It's My First."

526
00:23:51,208 --> 00:23:52,375
And now for a match!

527
00:23:52,458 --> 00:23:53,875
Renren, paper, scissors!
