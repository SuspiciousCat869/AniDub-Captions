[KANADE]
I'll never lose!

00:00:39,833 --> 00:00:41,041
That's impossible!

3
00:00:41,125 --> 00:00:43,541
Justice cannot die!

4
00:00:43,625 --> 00:00:45,916
[TOM]
Always so naive!

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,458
There's no justice! It's a lie!

6
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:52,916
Which one? Who will it be?

7
00:01:03,458 --> 00:01:05,208
Kanade!

8
00:01:09,958 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm done!

9
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:17,875
Tom! Tom is the winner!

10
00:01:17,958 --> 00:01:20,125
--You're wrong.
--Huh?

11
00:01:20,208 --> 00:01:22,833
The real winner... is love.

00:01:28,291 --> 00:01:30,208
[GIN]
Hey, look! A pile of poo!

13
00:01:34,291 --> 00:01:37,291
[TOM] Heck yeah!
That was awesome!

14
00:01:37,375 --> 00:01:38,291
[GIN]
So cool!

15
00:01:38,375 --> 00:01:39,958
Next time,
let's do space robots!

16
00:01:40,041 --> 00:01:41,166
[TOM]
Yeah!

17
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:43,875
[laughing]

18
00:01:43,958 --> 00:01:46,083
"Love," huh...

19
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,708
[KAHO] Thank you
so much for everything.

20
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:32,291
[GUARD 7A]
Get home safe, now.

21
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:33,625
[KAHO]
Yes, sir.

22
00:03:37,666 --> 00:03:39,083
[KAHO] Thank you,
and I'm sorry you had

23
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:41,625
to come and get me,
Mr. Takahashi.

24
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:42,916
No, it's okay.

25
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,625
Can you tell me why
you were snooping around

26
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:46,333
an elementary school, though?

27
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,625
Poor Kaho's in a tough spot.

28
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:07,625
And she can't
even talk about it.

29
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:20,458
[CHIAKI]
Ignored by her ex-boyfriend

30
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:23,625
and mistaken for a stalker?

31
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:26,291
[SHUGO]
It's complicated, huh?

32
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:31,375
Oh! I forgot. Someone
called for you from home.

33
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:33,958
They said you weren't
answering your phone.

34
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:35,541
It seemed pretty urgent, too.

35
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:40,916
Yeah, I'd definitely
call that pretty urgent.

36
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,500
You have telegrams, as well.

37
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:47,791
Who sends telegrams?

38
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:50,333
Wow, I should probably
give him a call real quick.

39
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:57,666
[screaming]

40
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:00,083
[CHIAKI]
Well, that's not disturbing!

41
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:02,833
[KAHO]
I, um... I need to go home.

42
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:16,083
[TOM]
Hey, Kanade!

43
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:18,125
What was your deal
in dodge ball earlier?

44
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:19,875
You went down
in the first round!

45
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:21,333
That's not like you at all!

46
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:25,625
I have something I
would like to add to that.

47
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:27,625
What is this crap?

48
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:30,333
You're the best when it comes
to serving fair lunch portions,

49
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:32,291
but you're way off today, man.

50
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:33,458
Two carrots?

51
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,458
How could you do that to me?

52
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:37,125
[GIN]
Are you a pod person?

53
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:42,875
You guys are right.
Something's off.

54
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:45,583
I can't say I'm
quite myself, either.

55
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:48,166
It seems to me that we're
suffering from the same thing.

56
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:53,666
[KAZ] Kanade, you're
lovesick, aren't you?

57
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:58,083
I thought he broke up
with that one girl, though!

58
00:05:58,166 --> 00:05:59,916
You mean there
might be a new girl?

59
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,875
--Well, look at the play-ball!
--For real.

60
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:03,916
[KAZ]
You're thinking "playboy"!

61
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,583
Like Hanako?

62
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:07,083
[KAZ]
Who is Hanako?

63
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:09,000
Hey! Are you listening to me?

64
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:10,250
Who's Hanako?

65
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,625
[KANADE]
Kaho...

66
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:25,250
Do you get what's going on
with him? Because I sure don't.

67
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:27,083
Not at all.
But at times like these,

68
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:28,750
there's only one thing to do!

69
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:32,541
The Ten Time Quiz!

70
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:35,333
Yum-yum eat-'em-up,
hooray!

71
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:38,833
Kanade, say the word
"rest" ten times.

72
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:41,833
[KANADE]
Rest, rest, rest, rest, rest,

73
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:43,791
rest, rest, rest...

74
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:46,791
[NARRATOR]
In the "Ten Time Quiz" game,

75
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:49,708
one person makes another say
a given word ten times

76
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:52,041
then asks a question
to provoke an incorrect,

77
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:54,458
yet amusing response.

78
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:56,625
It is said to have its
roots in ancient Rome,

79
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:59,666
where a restaurateur challenged
his customers with "Venus"

80
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,333
and would then jab
them with his elbow

81
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:04,208
when they inevitably
failed to say "wenus."

82
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:08,125
Rest and rest.

83
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:10,000
Nice. Now add a B to it.

84
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:12,166
So, rest-buh?

85
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:15,208
[GIN]
No, it's breast!

86
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:16,208
Say breast!

87
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:17,416
[TOM]
Are you kidding me?

88
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,416
Kanade just got it wrong!

00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,791

We're having your
favorite tonight:

97
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,791
batter-fried fishcake
and seaweed.

98
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:36,083
Aren't you supposed to
gargle when you get home?

99
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:43,416
Anyone know what's
going on with him?

100
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,708
Maybe. I think he
must be lovesick.

101
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:48,500
Everyone can tell
something's up.

102
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:49,750
That's not normal Kanade.

103
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:51,458
I followed him home
to see if I could help.

104
00:07:51,541 --> 00:07:53,750
But I don't know what to do.

105
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:55,208
Well, what can you do?

106
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:56,916
Love is a rough business.

"Children's Telephone Helpline"?

108
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:06,791
[KAZ] You mean a kid can
simply call this number,

109

and a grown-up will help them
answer all their questions?

No way! All of them?

Don't you have something
you'd like to ask?

115
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:23,125
What? Me?

00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:26,208
Oh! I so know what
I wanna ask a grown-up!

--You do?
--Yep.

118

[KANADE] Okay, we can
borrow my dad's phone!

119
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:31,708

Yeah!

00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:33,458
We got 'em!

121
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:35,041
This might be a good thing.

And they seem like
they're interested.

123
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:38,541
When you first
mentioned wanting us

124
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:40,666
to run a children's
telephone hotline,

125
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:43,041
I wasn't sure what to expect.

126
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:45,000
I just wanted to
help those boys out.

127

They're all so worried
about Kanade, you know.

128
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:48,750
Right, sure you did.

129
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:50,833
I wonder if that precious Kaz
will call anytime soon.

130
00:08:50,916 --> 00:08:52,583
I've got something
I'd love to ask him!

Love to ask...

What? Aren't the kids
supposed to do the asking?

133
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:58,708
There's no way
that this ends well.

You're the worst!

A rest-buh, or a real breast,

Ah, boobies.

No, I didn't take any highways!

I could even take pictures

[KAZ]
It doesn't have to be.

Just what you're thinking.
What's bothering you.

00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,333
[JOJI]
Don't worry about me!

319
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:25,833
Go! Get the girl!

320
00:18:25,916 --> 00:18:27,500
[KANADE]
I'm sorry, Brother!

321
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:32,041
[KANADE]
Third stage: the mountain!

322
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:34,250
You ready to cross it?

323
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:35,041
[GIN]
What for?

324
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:36,125
[TOM]
A shortcut?

325
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:38,166
No, we go because it's there!

326
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:41,083
Awesome! Ha!

327
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:43,750
[BOYS]
Huff, huff, huff, huff, huff...

328
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:46,416
Tom!

329
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,750
[yells]

330
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:49,000
You guys okay?

331
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:51,000
No!

332
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:52,000
[GIN]
Keep going!

333
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:53,208
[TOM]
Dog poop alert!

334
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:56,375
[KANADE yelling]

335
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:57,791
[GIN, TOM]
Kanade!

336
00:18:57,875 --> 00:19:01,750
[KANADE yelling]

337
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:18,375
[JOJI]
It's no use, huh.

338
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:19,583
[TOM]
What can you do?

339
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:21,208
We all got flats.

340
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:24,250
[GIN] Yeah, I gotta get
to cram school anyway.

341
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:26,625
Kanade, let her go, man.

342
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:29,125
I won't give up.

343
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:30,666
I'll never give up!

344
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,833
I'll walk there.
I'll even crawl!

345
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:34,041
You can't!

346
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:40,041
[TAGA] If you want to
go that badly, hop on in.

347
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:43,958
[KANADE]
Taga!

348
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:47,416
Don't worry about your bike.
I'll take care of it.

349
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,666
[KANADE]
Tom!

350
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,916
And never fear.
I'll get to cram school on time!

351
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:51,875
[KANADE]
Gin!

352
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:53,541
Show her your manly spirit!

353
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,291
[KANADE]
See you later!

354
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:17,958
[KAHO] Home is where
the heart is, right?

355
00:20:22,958 --> 00:20:24,291
[KAHO]
Anyone here?

356
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:34,125
[MAN crying]

357
00:20:44,958 --> 00:20:52,416
[MAN crying]

358
00:22:27,041 --> 00:22:29,458
I just got one of
the biggest scoops ever!

359
00:22:30,791 --> 00:22:32,541
According to my big brothers,

360
00:22:32,625 --> 00:22:34,708
if you're going 40 miles
an hour on your bike,

361
00:22:34,791 --> 00:22:36,458
and you do this,
it's supposed to feel

362
00:22:36,541 --> 00:22:38,708
exactly like touching boobies!

363
00:22:38,791 --> 00:22:39,708
--Yeah?
--Cool!

364
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:40,958
Seriously?

365
00:22:41,041 --> 00:22:42,583
[TOM] Apparently,
it's called "air-petting"!

366
00:22:42,666 --> 00:22:44,791
It's an all-you-can-touch
boobie joyride!

367
00:22:44,875 --> 00:22:46,708
If ya ask me, it's worth a try.

368
00:22:46,791 --> 00:22:49,000
Yeah, but how can
we go that fast?

369
00:22:49,083 --> 00:22:50,333
[ARASHI chuckles]

370
00:22:51,291 --> 00:22:52,666
You can sit back
and let a grown-up

371
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:53,958
show you how it's done.

372
00:22:54,041 --> 00:22:55,125
[KANADE]
Good luck, Arashi!

373
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:56,708
[TOM]
You can do it!

374
00:22:56,791 --> 00:23:01,458
[BOYS cheering]

375
00:23:01,541 --> 00:23:03,291
Talk to me, Kaz.

376
00:23:03,375 --> 00:23:04,625
Am I going 40 yet?

377
00:23:04,708 --> 00:23:06,791
Um... Why are you
asking Kaz about that?

378
00:23:06,875 --> 00:23:09,708
[KOTA] Is it because
he's good at numbers?

379
00:23:09,791 --> 00:23:10,958
Not... quite...

380
00:23:11,041 --> 00:23:13,708
I ask... because
Kaz is beautiful!

381
00:23:13,791 --> 00:23:15,166
[moaning]

382
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:16,291
[ARASHI]
Tell me, Kaz.

383
00:23:16,375 --> 00:23:18,291
Am I there yet?

384
00:23:18,375 --> 00:23:19,833
Oh, yes!

385
00:23:19,916 --> 00:23:21,958
So close! I'm almost there!

386
00:23:22,041 --> 00:23:23,958
I'm there! I'm so there!

387
00:23:24,041 --> 00:23:25,958
[TAGA]
Shut up!

388
00:23:26,041 --> 00:23:27,666
Owie. Taga...

389
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:30,916
You know you can kick
me more if you want.

390
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,250
You disgusting pathogen.

391
00:23:33,333 --> 00:23:36,416
Great. I'd like to report
a deviant, please.

392
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,375
Yes, and hurry.

393
00:23:39,666 --> 00:23:40,750
[RENREN]
Renren here!

394
00:23:40,833 --> 00:23:43,041
Coming up on
<i>First Love Monster</i> .

395
00:23:43,125 --> 00:23:44,500
[mumbling incoherently]

396
00:23:44,583 --> 00:23:46,166
[RENREN]
All that and more!

397
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:49,000
Next time: "A Hushed and
Crabby Love Song."

398
00:23:49,083 --> 00:23:50,500
And now, let's
do an impression

399
00:23:50,583 --> 00:23:52,416
of a boiled Echizen crab.

400
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,625
Ready, set, scissors!
