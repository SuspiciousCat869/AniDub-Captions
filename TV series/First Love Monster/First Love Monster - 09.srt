Please tell me.
I'm lost in worry.

Yes. He's my first love.

What's his occupation?
His pedigree?

I can only assume he must
be quite the smooth customer

No! He dumped you?!

321
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:42,625
Rich words coming from someone
who used Kaho so cruelly!

322
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:47,666
I can't handle this anymore!

323
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,583
Boy, are you an easy one.

324
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:51,875
You were dumped and depressed,
but a little "I love you"

325
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:53,625
gets you all dreamy.

326
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:57,041
Cheap as bread crusts
that are sold for a dime.

327
00:16:57,125 --> 00:16:59,541
And yet you get so full of
yourself when all the ducks

328
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:01,791
at the park start
their swarming.

329
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:03,708
Which is why I'm dying
to keep reminding you

330
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:05,458
that you're just unwanted waste.

331
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:06,875
How rude!

332
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:09,541
If Kaho were bread, she'd
be a fresh-baked baguette!

333
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:11,750
No. She'd be a fried bun!

334
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:14,541
But either way,
Kaho is still bread.

335
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:16,041
[DAIKOKU]
Pardon me?

336
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:18,583
Your attitude is the very
definition of how one teases

337
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:20,166
the girl he loves.

338
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:22,666
Perhaps the truth is that
you really do care for her.

339
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,333
Is he right, Taga?

340
00:17:24,416 --> 00:17:28,250
Is that why you offered
to drive me all the way here?

341
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:29,750
I see.

342
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:34,208
I hadn't realized it,
but maybe I like Kaho.

343
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:36,500
Maybe I bully her
because I love her!

344
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:40,875
[TAGA] Yes, I must love
this stupid, simple,

345
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:43,625
wishy-washy, moldy
breadcrumb of a girl.

346
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:45,750
Unfit to feed the ducks.

347
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:47,750
[KAHO] Except that's
not something you say

348
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:49,291
to a girl you love.

349
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:52,500
Taga's found a whole new game
to torture me, that's all.

350
00:17:54,916 --> 00:17:57,750
I want to hear
what Kaho has to say.

351
00:17:57,833 --> 00:18:00,291
I love you. Forgive me.

352
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:02,833
Can we please get back together?

353
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:04,250
[DAIKOKU]
Kaho!

354
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:05,833
Don't be taken in by his
sweet-talking nonsense!

355
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:07,375
[KAHO]
I forgive you.

356
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:09,791
But I can't go back to the way
things were before, Kanade.

357
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:10,916
A moment, please.

358
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,541
You're not being taken in?

359
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:17,500
[KAHO] Daikoku. I'd like
to speak with Kanade alone.

360
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:24,375
[KAHO] Well the truth is
that I do love you, Kanade.

361
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:27,083
I honestly do.

362
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:28,166
However...

363
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:32,125
I'm only a kid,
and still too selfish?

364
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:33,541
The way it stands now,

365
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:36,583
we'll just keep repeating
the same things.

366
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:39,541
And I... I don't
want to be hurt again.

367
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:42,458
I'm afraid I'll eventually start
to doubt your feelings for me.

368
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:45,250
Fine. Then I'll do what it
takes to turn into a grown-up

369
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:47,208
you can trust!

370
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:50,666
[KAHO] But Kanade, I like
you the way you are now.

371
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:54,041
There's really no need for
you to grow up in any hurry.

372
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:56,166
Besides, if you changed,

373
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:58,708
you wouldn't be the
person I loved anymore.

374
00:18:58,791 --> 00:19:01,666
Then, tell me,
what should I do?

375
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,291
[KAHO]
Do you remember...

376
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:05,958
That day I met you
for the first time?

377
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:13,833
[KAHO] Falling for you
made me realize something.

378
00:19:13,916 --> 00:19:16,791
I knew I couldn't stay the same.

379
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:20,750
I knew I would have to change,
and it turns out that I have.

380
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:23,208
[KANADE] That doesn't
make any sense, Kaho!

381
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:26,875
If you like me the way I am,
then I like you how you are.

382
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:29,583
Let's change together, please!

383
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:31,083
We'll boost our power!

384
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:33,625
Don't you want to
special attack with me?

385
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:35,791
[KAHO]
What is he talking about?

386
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:39,958
[KANADE] I saw this at an
arts festival in third grade.

387
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:43,250
The prince and princess,
bound together for eternity.

388
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:50,000
So you fell in love with me,
an elementary school kid.

389
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:51,416
What now?

390
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:54,250
[KAHO]
My heart's pounding so fast,

391
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:57,041
and I really do love Kanade.

392
00:19:57,125 --> 00:19:59,291
I don't care what anyone says.

393
00:19:59,375 --> 00:20:01,916
I wanna be with him.

394
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,625
Wait... Listen to this.

395
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:07,625
To Kaho, at 15.
"Love Song to Kaho."

396
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:11,916
[KAHO]
What is this?

397
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,166
I'm feeling so many
things at once.

398
00:21:23,666 --> 00:21:25,791
Kaho, let's get married!

399
00:23:39,916 --> 00:23:41,000
[RENREN]
Renren here!

400
00:23:41,083 --> 00:23:43,125
Coming up on
<i>First Love Monster</i> .

401
00:23:43,208 --> 00:23:45,500
[mumbling incoherently]

402
00:23:45,583 --> 00:23:47,416
[RENREN]
All that and more!

403
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:50,500
Next time:
"A Proper Rom-Com for Once."

404
00:23:50,583 --> 00:23:52,250
And now for a match!

405
00:23:52,333 --> 00:23:54,333
Renren, paper, scissors!
