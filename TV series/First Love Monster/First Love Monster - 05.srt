1
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:42,041
Hold on! Not there!
Please, not right there!

2
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:45,250
Come on, Kaho, I know you
can feel how hard this is.

3
00:00:45,333 --> 00:00:46,541
[gasps]

4
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:51,208
[KANADE]
Just relax!

5
00:00:51,291 --> 00:00:53,250
[KOTA] Oh, God, what are
they doing in there?

6
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:54,416
Surely not...

7
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:55,833
Oh, God, what are
they doing in there?!

8
00:00:55,916 --> 00:00:57,625
Oh, God, what are
you doing out here?

9
00:00:57,708 --> 00:00:59,291
[KOTA] What? Me?
What? Nothing!

10
00:00:59,375 --> 00:01:01,166
I'm not... Nothing!

11
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:02,458
[KANADE]
You like it, Kaho?

12
00:01:02,541 --> 00:01:05,375
What about here?
Does that feel good, too?

13
00:01:05,458 --> 00:01:06,291
[KOTA]
Chiaki, wait!

14
00:01:06,375 --> 00:01:08,625
Knock, knock! What's going on?

15
00:01:09,708 --> 00:01:11,000
[KANADE]
A massage!

16
00:01:14,125 --> 00:01:17,333
[KAHO sighs]

17
00:01:17,416 --> 00:01:18,375
[KOTA]
Huh?

18
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:20,708
[KANADE]
Kaho looked tired.

19
00:01:20,791 --> 00:01:23,875
My mom did this a lot
for me when I was tired.

20
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:26,333
Disappointed a bit there,
Obscene-ohara?

21
00:01:26,416 --> 00:01:27,916
This was all way more wholesome

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,291
than whatever you were hoping
for while you were listening in.

23
00:01:31,375 --> 00:01:33,500
Thanks, Kanade.
That was amazing!

24
00:01:33,583 --> 00:01:36,333
Yeah, you still look
real tired, though.

25
00:01:36,416 --> 00:01:40,208
Meaning... it's time
for my ultimate weapon!

26
00:01:42,333 --> 00:01:44,500
We're gonna go to
the super bathhouse!

27
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:29,458
[KAHO] I can see why this
is a super bathhouse.

28
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:34,250
[KAHO] I hope Kanade doesn't
look as good in swim trunks

29
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:36,125
as I bet he will.

30
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:37,916
[WOMAN 5A laughs]
Don't you do it!

31
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,666
I've never seen men and
women bathe together before.

32
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:44,000
Really? First time at
a place like this, huh?

33
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:45,625
--Guilty!
--[KANADE] Kaho!

34
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:57,333
[KAHO] Kanade's going all out.
And in more ways than one.

35
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:58,541
[KANADE]
Okay, Kaho.

36
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:00,208
What bath do you
wanna try first?

37
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:01,666
Nope, hold it.

38
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:05,125
This is a bath, not a pool.
So take those goggles off!

39
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:06,625
And the rest
of you children,

40
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:09,208
you gone to the bathroom?

41
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:10,791
If you haven't gone,
then go now!

42
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:13,666
We don't need you
warming up the water!

43
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,583
I didn't have to
go until you said that.

44
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:16,916
I wonder how come.

45
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,958
Because you're a
poopy-faced poop-man!

46
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:21,291
Hilarious.

47
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,375
Fifth grade boys sure
do like poop, am I right?

48
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:24,666
[KANADE]
Wrong!

49
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,541
See? I'm mature for my age,

50
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:28,333
so I don't like all
that poop stuff.

51
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:30,333
And I'd never mistake
poop for chocolate!

52
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:32,666
Like never ever ever, whatever.

53
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,208
[KAHO]
Oh, Kanade.

54
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:35,833
No one would say
something like that

55
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:38,208
unless it had actually happened.

56
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:39,250
[KAZ]
Kanade.

57
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:43,708
That's enough.
Off to the restroom. Let's go.

58
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:45,125
[KANADE, GIN, TOM]
Aww...

00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:47,458
[KAZ]
Shut up! Move it, guys.

60
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:48,625
[KANADE, GIN, TOM]
Fine.

61
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,916
[KOTA]
Uh... Miss Nikaido...

62
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,458
I'm really sorry,
for, you know...

63
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:56,250
Tagging along with you two.

64
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:57,541
B-Because I'm, uh,

65
00:04:57,625 --> 00:04:59,791
barging in on your
date, and stuff.

66
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:03,125
[KAHO]
Oh, right.

67
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:05,541
I guess that technically
this is a date.

68
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:06,875
[KOTA gasps]

69
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:09,375
[CHIAKI] You are such a
masochist, you know that?

70
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:13,083
[KAHO]
Oh, Kanade.

71
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:16,333
Wow! My junk won't
move in these!

72
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:17,500
Awesome!

73
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:19,500
I've been taking big,
giant steps, too,

74
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:20,958
and my wiener hasn't budged!

75
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:22,916
Talk about some
powerful trunks!

76
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,958
Yes. But what if
I did a cartwheel?

77
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:29,875
Nothing moved.

78
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:35,125
Beans and wiener are good!

79
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:37,083
Yeah. Junk security achieved!

[KAHO]
Wow!

00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:44,458
They have so many
different kinds of baths!

83
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:48,083
[CHIAKI] That's why elementary
school kids like it so much.

84
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:50,291
Speaking of, they
sure are taking a while.

85
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:52,875
I imagine they're
playing some stupid game.

86
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:56,125
I should probably
go check on them.

87
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:57,916
[KAHO]
This was Kanade's idea,

88
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,500
so I feel like I should spend
some of the time with him.

Bare behind!

to do it for real,

95
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:12,041
but Tom did!

96

where did you run off to?

[KAHO]
Is that Kanade?

99
00:06:29,791 --> 00:06:31,958
You're not supposed to run
around like that here.

100
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:34,625
Didn't your folks teach
ya right, Little Missy?

101
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:36,916
Uh... okay.

102
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,208
I wasn't running, but, um,
thank you for catching me.

It's you!

So you gonna
bring it, or what?

'Cause it's being
brought over here!

116
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:04,916
There comes a time
in a man's life

117
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,625
where he must fight
for his honor.

I recognized that voice.

It's Joji Takahashi!

Ah! Hey, Brother!

124
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:23,458
[KAHO] What does he
mean by brother?

125
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:25,166
[JOJI] When'd you decide
to go and get so big?

I'm having a growth
spurt, that's all!

128
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:29,916
Been there, Brother.
Been there!

129
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,708
[KAHO]
A "growth spurt" is all?

130
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:34,875
That's gotta be the biggest
understatement of the year.

131
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:36,375
Karma. Reincarnation.

132
00:07:36,458 --> 00:07:39,000
Long-lost brothers,
reunited at last!

133
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:40,666
It was guided
by the cosmos!

134
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,291
A question, Kanade!

135
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:43,958
I've known you
since kindergarten,

136
00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:45,833
but this is the first I've
heard of any brother!

137
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:47,333
Who exactly is that guy?

138
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:49,500
Wait. You mean me?

139
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:51,833
[KAHO] So he's not his
older brother after all?

140
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:53,041
Well, then, who is he?

141
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:55,000
And what's with that accent?

142
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:57,125
I'm not his brother.
I'm actually his cousin.

143
00:07:57,208 --> 00:07:58,916
The name's Joji Takahashi.

called me that before!

00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:12,583
[JOJI] Kanade's nice,
but he's still a kid.

153
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:14,041
I mean, he's in fifth grade!

154
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:15,583
What are ya datin' him for?

155
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:19,416
You should date me instead.

156

[KAHO]
What? No, wait. I, um...

157

I'm lots more grown up, darlin'!

158

The truth is that I love him!

160
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:29,541
[JOJI]
So? Who cares 'bout that?

161
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:32,875
Joji, do you, uh, mind if
I ask how old you are?

162
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:37,666
I'm in sixth grade.

163
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,916
[KAHO]
Yeah, I figured as much.

164
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,875
It also says so right there.

165
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,958
Oh, good, we found Kanade.

166
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:46,875
Jeez, are there
more of them, now?

167
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:49,291
She's my girlfriend. Stop that.

168
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:51,041
I don't want to have
to say it again, Brother!

169
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:53,625
Well, I'll be.
It's one woman and two men.

170
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:54,833
You know what that means, right?

171
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:55,833
[KANADE]
Say what?

172
00:08:55,916 --> 00:08:56,708
Say who?

173
00:08:56,791 --> 00:08:57,583
Say where?

174
00:08:57,666 --> 00:08:59,125
Say why me?

175
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:01,416
It's time for battle!

176
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:07,625
[KANADE]
You ready for this, Brother?

177
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:09,041
Ready!

178
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:11,625
Whoever gets the other's
swim cap first is the winner!

179
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:14,958
Hey, Arashi, this has nothing
to do with us two, so...

180
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:16,500
...why are we horses?

181
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:19,625
I dunno. Just figured it was
the path of least resistance.

182
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:21,125
Let's do this, fellas!

183
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:23,000
[yelling]

184
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:24,750
Maybe I should stop this.

185
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:26,166
[KAZ]
No, leave them alone.

186
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:35,458
[KAHO] What the--that seems a
little elegant for a bathhouse.

187
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,041
Yes, sir, as you wish.

188
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:39,333
[KAHO] Are you kidding me?
He has a butler?

189
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,208
Believe me. In my experience,

190
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:46,416
when you hang out with fools,
you get caught in the crossfire.

191
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,333
Yeah, well, in my experience,
when you hang out with fools,

192
00:09:49,416 --> 00:09:51,416
you should just pretend
you don't know them.

193
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,416
Tom! Gin! Make a right turn!

194
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,333
[KAHO] Kanade seems
so much more excited

195
00:09:58,416 --> 00:10:00,333
now that he's seeing Joji.

196
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:02,708
For I guess the
first time in a while.

197
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:04,291
This should be fun!

198
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:06,250
It's about to get real now!

199
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:09,166
Here comes my killer move,
the head grab!

200
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:14,208
Success, boys!
I'm holding the prize!

201
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:15,666
What? No, you're not!

202
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:21,875
Whose swim trucks are those?
They're not mine.

203
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:26,791
They're his!
They're Kota Shinohara's trunks!

204
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:28,375
No pants! No pants!

205
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:29,875
No-pants Kota!

206
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:31,791
Bare butt! Bare butt!

207
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:33,500
[whistle blowing]

208
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:35,708
What is this?
Are you guys in high school?

209
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:36,958
[KANADE]
No way, dude.

210
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:38,541
Okay, so you're in college.

211
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:40,166
Either way, quit fooling around.

212
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:41,541
You all should be
ashamed of yourselves.

213
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:43,500
You're too old and
grown up for this crap.

214
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:46,583
We are not too old or
grown up for this crap!

215
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:47,750
Ah!

216
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:49,250
[KOTA, ARASHI]
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry...

217
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:50,833
[apologizing]

218
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:52,583
So, why are you here, Brother?

219
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:55,083
You're a really long
way from home.

220
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:56,875
I'm a traveler, now, man.

221
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:58,375
I've forsaken my land.

222
00:10:58,458 --> 00:10:59,416
Huh?

223
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:03,000
[JOJI]
Truth is, Mom betrayed me.

224
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:05,958
She went and tossed out
all of my Pachimon cards.

225
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:06,916
[ALL gasp]

226
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,458
No, how could she?

227
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:11,916
[KANADE] I... I didn't
even know that was a thing.

228
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
[TOM] Mothers are fearsome
creatures who can,

229
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:16,083
on occasion,
perform such atrocities

230
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:19,041
without the batting
of a single eye.

231
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:20,416
[JOJI gasps]

232
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,500
My brothers!

233
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:25,666
That's Kanade's cousin for you--
a man of discriminating taste!

234
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:28,666
That's Kanade's pals for ya!
Let's take a bath, guys!

235
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:31,416
Indeed. It shall be a sign
of our reconciliation.

236
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,750
Yeah!

237
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:35,000
So does this mean
they've made up now?

238
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:36,083
[KANADE]
Kaho!

239
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:40,833
Hey, Kaho! Come over here!

240
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:42,625
Oh... okay!

[laughing]

242
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:00,333
This is so nice.

Barista, the usual, please.

00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:03,666
Chomolungma, sir?

Mount Everest, duh!

[KANADE]
Kilimanjaro!

247

The Kilimanjaro jar, yo!

00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:12,500
The Kilimanjaro jar, yo!

Jar, yo! Jar, yo!

[CHIAKI]
It's starting to get dark out,

253
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:22,333
so you kids be careful.

254
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:24,208
Thanks, but we're fine.

255
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:25,583
Makurazaki's on it.

256
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:27,500
Kanade! Bye-bye-banana!

[KANADE]
Banana-nana buttface!

Whoa!

259
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,625
[GIN, TOM]

[laughing]

263
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:40,083
[KANADE] The dinosaur
bath really did it for me.

264
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:41,333
What about you?

265
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:43,041
[KAHO]
Let's see...

266
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:45,083
The diet cola
bath was different.

267
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:46,541
D'you feel a little better now?

268
00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:47,625
[KAHO]
Mm-hmm!

269
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:51,500
Kanade. Kaho, darlin'.

270
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,500
May I have a word
with y'all in private?

271
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:07,625
Um, we're spying on them.

272
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:09,083
Are you sure that's all right?

273
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:10,250
Of course!

274
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:12,083
You should always
prioritize good drama.

275
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,416
Yeah, and besides,

276
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,625
since when does an inveterate
eavesdropper care?

277
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:24,291
So what's this
all about, Brother?

278
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:26,500
[JOJI] Remember how I said I
came here because my mom

279
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:28,791
threw out all my Pachimon cards?

280
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:30,416
--Sure do.
--[JOJI] Well...

281
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:33,458
Ha!

282
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:35,458
The whole truth is that I
been holdin' this ultra-rare

283
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:38,041
3S card on my person
the whole time!

284
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:39,875
What? No way!

285
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:41,708
That's the "Gaia
Whispers 'Shine'" card,

286
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:43,041
and it's gorgeous!

287
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:45,958
Ew! Did he just pull that
out of his underwear?

288
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:47,708
[JOJI] I been holdin'
it this whole time!

00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:48,958
[KANADE]
No way! It's gorgeous!

290
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:50,875
[TAGA] What are you guys
spying on this time?

[KOTA]
Oh! Hi, Taga!

Shh!

[JOJI]
I'd like it to be yours.

Seriously? Thanks, man!

00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:00,958

I ain't givin' it away for free.

296
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:03,291
Okay, so what?
You want money or something?

297
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:05,583
I can't even afford a
basic pack of boosters!

298
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:07,750
[JOJI]
It's a tradin' card, remember?

299
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:09,625
Well, then, what do
you wanna trade for it?

300
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:12,166
It's simple. The card for Kaho!

301
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:13,833
[KAHO wailing]

302
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:15,958
[JOJI] Come on.
Pretty sweet deal, isn't it?

303
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:19,250
[KAHO]
No! Surely he wouldn't...!

304
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:20,791
Don't do it, Kanade!

305
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:22,916
No deal.

306
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,625
Kaho isn't a thing.

307
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:28,666
You can't do that. You can't
treat girls like they're things.

308
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:34,375
[KAHO] I actually thought
he might go for it.

309
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:35,916
I'm sorry.

310

He's so sweet.
Thank you, Kanade.

311

Oh my gosh! Why am I so happy?

312
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,083
Yeah, you're right.

313
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:46,041
I dunno what I was
thinkin', Kanade.

314
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:47,666
I apologize, Brother.

00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:54,625
My accent ain't catchin'!

319
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:57,541
[laughing]

320
00:14:57,625 --> 00:14:59,875
[KAHO] It's like they're
even closer now.

321
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:02,541
They must be such good friends.

322
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:03,625
Hey, you know what?

323
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:04,875
How can I help ya, Brother?

324
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:06,875
With the trading card
off the table now,

325
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:08,666
I've been thinking that, uh...

326
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:11,416
Maybe we should
all date together!

327
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,458
[KAHO]
Eh?

328
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:15,250
Wait, you mean the three of us?

329
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:17,500
You, me, and Kaho makes three!

330
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,125
[KAHO]
What? He can't be serious!

331
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:20,625
"You, me, and Kaho makes three"

332
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:22,541
sounds like some
stupid romance novel.

333
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:23,833
This is crazy.

334
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:25,500
Just because they're
getting along doesn't mean

335
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:27,375
I have to get along with them!

336
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:30,250
Listen, you and Kaho are
both really important to me,

337
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:32,416
so I figured what could be
better than all three of us

338
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,416
being able to hang
out with each other?

339
00:15:36,625 --> 00:15:38,541
[KAHO]
Why does it hurt?

340
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:41,916
I know this kind of thing
happens all the time, but...

341
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,083
And I know it's not
the first time Kanade's

342
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:45,958
gotten things mixed up, either.

343
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:48,250
[ARASHI]
Uh-oh.

344
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:50,291
[KOTA whimpering]

345
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:53,500
From here on,
we'll be the best trio ever!

346
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:54,375
Yeah!

347
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:56,250
[KAHO]
Oh, no.

348
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:58,875
My heart... it's hurting.

349
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,583
[KANADE laughing]

350
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:01,958
[KAHO]
This isn't right.

351
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:04,708
[KANADE]
Huh?

352
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:06,708
[KAHO]
I wanted to be in a couple,

353
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:08,875
nd that's only two people,
not three.

354
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:10,666
[KANADE] I get that,
but I was just trying to think

355
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,041
about Joji's feelings.

356
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:15,875
[KAHO] But what about
my feelings, Kanade?

357
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:19,625
Not to mention
how you really feel.

358
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:21,416
What do you mean,
your feelings?

359
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,083
You love me, don't you?

360
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:25,458
[KAHO]
Yes, Kanade, I suppose I do.

361
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:27,875
But I love you, only you.

362
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:29,708
I don't want to be
forced to share the time

363
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:31,958
we spend together
playing with Joji,

364
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:34,791
and you should have
asked me about that.

365
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:36,000
You don't wanna play?

366
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:38,083
Well, then,
what do you wanna do?

367
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:41,375
[KAHO] Kanade, it's not
about what I wanna do.

368
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:44,125
The point I'm trying to make
is that I want to be special

369
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:45,541
for you alone.

370
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:49,333
And I want you to be
special for me alone, too.

371
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:52,000
I don't care about whatever
immature things you do

372
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:54,541
or whatever kiddy
stuff you say.

373
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:57,958
None of that matters as
long as I'm special to you.

374
00:16:58,041 --> 00:17:01,291
But I'm starting to
get the feeling that...

375
00:17:01,375 --> 00:17:05,000
I don't know, it's like you...

376
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:06,916
...it's like you don't love me.

377
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,875
Not at all.

378
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:11,916
[KAHO crying]

379
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:16,000
Wait, Kaho, are you crying?

380
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:17,541
Tell me where it hurts!

381
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:19,041
[TAGA]
It's her heart.

382
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:20,666
You hurt her heart.

383
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,208
[KANADE]
Taga?

384
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,708
Now before, when you
said I made her cry,

385
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:26,416
you hit me for doing it.

386
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,750
Remember?

387
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:31,750
But this time you're
the one who made her cry.

388
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:34,208
And you did it in a
much crueler way, too.

389
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:39,541
What are you talking about?
I wasn't being a bully!

390
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:42,666
[TAGA] No, but you don't
really love her and never did.

391
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:45,333
That's why she's crying.

392
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:49,333
[TAGA] In which case, I,
the actual adult around here...

393
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:51,083
...will take her with me.

394
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:58,500
[KAHO]
What is Taga trying to do?

395
00:17:58,583 --> 00:17:59,833
Hey!

396
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:01,875
What's the big idea,
buttin' in on us?

397
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:03,041
Who the heck are you?

398
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:04,583
[TAGA] I could ask
you the same thing.

399
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:07,583
[KANADE]
This guy is my cousin, Taga.

400
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:08,500
How old?

401
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:10,208
[JOJI]
I'm in the sixth grade!

402
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:12,125
Of course you are.

403
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:13,541
What do you think
you're laughin' at?

404
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:15,000
Age don't matter none!

405
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:17,583
Besides, you can't
just take her!

406
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:20,583
It's like Kanade said,
Kaho ain't a thing!

407
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,625
She's not just something
that you can give and take!

408
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:26,666
[Don't worry, I don't intend
on taking her as a thing.

409
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:29,375
Oh, I'll be taking
her heart, as well.

410
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:32,125
In a way that a
little kid never could.

411
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:33,666
[KAHO]
Um...

412
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,500
[JOJI] What the heck do you
mean, "a way we never could"?

413
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:37,583
[KANADE] Because I can
do anything if I try!

414
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:40,666
[JOJI] And I'm a push comes
to shove kinda man, myself!

415
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:43,250
Big talk for kids who don't
know anything about women.

416
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:46,250
Will you stop it with
all the "um"ing already?

417
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:49,125
If you've got something
to say, then just say it.

418
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:51,500
God, you're annoying.

419
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:54,916
If that's true, if I'm
just so annoying to you,

420
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,416
why won't you write me off,
then, and leave me alone?

421
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,833
No one here asked
for you to jump in.

422
00:18:59,916 --> 00:19:01,208
[TAGA]
Huh?

423
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:03,666
I guess you're not
taking the bait this time.

424
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:06,375
Is it possible the stupid girl
has learned something?

425
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:08,041
[KAHO]
What? Back off.

426
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:10,791
Kanade and I... we're having
an important discussion!

427
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:12,041
[TAGA chuckles]

428
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:13,916
An important discussion, is it?

429
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:16,875
Huh?

430
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:18,125
[KAHO]
Kanade?

431
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:20,041
[TAGA]
You must be so proud,

432
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:22,916
what, with elementary
kids fighting over you.

433
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,125
[laughs]
That's worth spying on. Right?

434
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:29,166
They can't tear
themselves away.

435
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:30,750
No! It's not like that!

436
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:33,250
Really? Then what
is it like, Kota?

437
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:35,166
[KAHO]
I'm getting spied on again?

438
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:37,000
What's wrong with these people?

439
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:40,208
They're all just so, so...

440
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:41,791
I do so know about women!

441
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:44,500
Me too! It's spelled W-O-Man!

442
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:46,333
[KAHO]
I can't!

443
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:47,541
I just can't!

444
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:50,041
[crying]

445
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:52,333
[KAHO] I'm not getting
through to him at all!

446
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:53,750
Taga's a jerk.

447
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:56,500
And everyone else thinks
all of this is fun.

448
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:58,875
I have no idea what
Kanade's thinking,

449
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:01,250
and I hate that I even care!

450
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:04,000
I did my best to put
my feelings into words,

451
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:05,875
but he's just not getting it.

452
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:09,458
[KAHO]
What do I do now?

453
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:10,875
What do I do?

454
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:53,708
Now, today's topic...

455
00:21:53,791 --> 00:21:56,458
[KOTA] No, first I want
my trunks back, okay?

456
00:21:56,541 --> 00:21:57,708
Who has them?

457
00:21:57,791 --> 00:21:59,958
Question! Do you know
what the difference is

458
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:01,416
between a wiener
and a pee-pee?

459
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,791
Where did that come from?

460
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:05,000
I was just thinking there's
lots of words for it.

461
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:07,583
That's right. I've heard old
men call their thing a [ding].

462
00:22:07,666 --> 00:22:10,250
Whenever my sister is changing
her little baby's dirty diapers,

463
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:11,750
she always calls it a pee-pee.

464
00:22:11,833 --> 00:22:13,750
Anyway, can I get
my trunks back please?

465
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:15,041
That's a good theory.

466
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:17,000
Newborn boys have pee-pees.

467
00:22:17,083 --> 00:22:18,333
While we have wieners!

468
00:22:18,416 --> 00:22:19,958
And old guys have [ding]!

469
00:22:20,041 --> 00:22:20,875
[KOTA]
I need my trunks!

470
00:22:20,958 --> 00:22:22,333
[JOJI]
Well, that's cool!

471
00:22:22,416 --> 00:22:24,250
So that means wieners change
names as they get bigger.

472
00:22:24,333 --> 00:22:26,458
You mean like promotion
fish change names?

473
00:22:26,541 --> 00:22:28,125

What's a promotion fish?

474
00:22:28,208 --> 00:22:29,375
Very good question.

475
00:22:29,458 --> 00:22:32,000
They're fish whose names
change as they mature.

476
00:22:32,083 --> 00:22:34,208
For example:
The <i>buri</i> yellowtail,

477
00:22:34,291 --> 00:22:37,416
it starts off as <i>wakashi</i> ,
<i>inada</i> , <i>warasa</i> .

478
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:40,708
And then, its final
ultimate form is <i>buri</i> .

479
00:22:40,791 --> 00:22:42,208
Whoa.

480
00:22:42,291 --> 00:22:43,791
What I'm gettin' outta this
is we should be calling 'em

481
00:22:43,875 --> 00:22:44,958
promotion wieners.

482
00:22:45,041 --> 00:22:46,708
--Like this?
--[JOJI, TOM, KANADE] Ooh!

483
00:22:46,791 --> 00:22:47,833
[KANADE]
Wait!

484
00:22:47,916 --> 00:22:49,208
Think first.

485
00:22:49,291 --> 00:22:50,791
I've heard people calling
wieners rods and poles

486
00:22:50,875 --> 00:22:52,625
and bats and all kinds
of other stuff.

487
00:22:52,708 --> 00:22:53,666
[TOM, JOJI, GIN]
Say what?

488
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:55,791
What about that, Kaz?
Teach us!

489
00:22:59,041 --> 00:23:01,416
Clearly, they must have
evolved independently.

490
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,541
[JOJI, TOM, KANADE]
Ah!

491
00:23:02,625 --> 00:23:04,250
Evolved independently?

492
00:23:04,333 --> 00:23:05,583
That's so cool!

493
00:23:07,083 --> 00:23:08,750
[GIN] You know,
I've heard a word, too.

494
00:23:08,833 --> 00:23:11,500
It's a special term that has
something to do with wieners.

495
00:23:13,833 --> 00:23:16,750
Let's see,
I think it's "erection."

496
00:23:16,833 --> 00:23:17,916
"Erection"?

497
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,916
We got us a whole
new one now!

498
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,541
Wait! I think I heard Mom say
her clam dish was erectable!

499
00:23:23,625 --> 00:23:25,208
[JOJI] Ooh, so it's
a kind of shellfish?

500
00:23:25,291 --> 00:23:27,208
No, you're wrong! Wrong!

501
00:23:27,291 --> 00:23:28,875
You know what that means.

502
00:23:28,958 --> 00:23:31,291
It's the final evolution
of the wiener.

503
00:23:31,375 --> 00:23:33,333
Erection!

504
00:23:33,416 --> 00:23:34,541
[laughing]

505
00:23:34,625 --> 00:23:36,500
[KOTA] Listen to me,
guys, you're so wrong!

506
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:37,833
And where are my trunks?

507
00:23:39,875 --> 00:23:40,958
[RENREN]
Renren here!

508
00:23:41,041 --> 00:23:43,166
Coming up on
<i>First Love Monster</i> .

509
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:46,666
[mumbling incoherently]

510
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:48,208
[RENREN]
All that, and more!

511
00:23:48,291 --> 00:23:50,875
Next time:
"Hula-Hoop Hullabaloo"!

512
00:23:50,958 --> 00:23:52,333
And now for a match!

513
00:23:52,416 --> 00:23:54,291
Renren, paper, scissors!
