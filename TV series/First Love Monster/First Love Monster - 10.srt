00:00:15,916 --> 00:00:17,333
[KANADE] Well, whaddya say,
Crabita baby?

2
00:00:17,416 --> 00:00:19,666
[KANADE] Will you stop it
already, Echizen Pete!

3
00:00:22,416 --> 00:00:24,166
[KANADE] You've been letting
Crabbonio get all up

4
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:26,583
inside your shell, haven't you?

5
00:00:26,666 --> 00:00:28,000
[KANADE]
That's none of your business.

6
00:00:28,083 --> 00:00:30,333
What's inside my shell
belongs to me!

7
00:00:30,416 --> 00:00:33,208
Sure, it may be stuffed full
of goo, but that's my goo!

8
00:00:33,291 --> 00:00:36,333
[KANADE]
Crabita? Crabita!

9
00:00:38,458 --> 00:00:41,666
[KANADE] Crabita, your goo
is basically poop, isn't it?

10
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,750
[KANADE] Talk about
no tact, Echizen Pete!

11
00:00:43,833 --> 00:00:45,083
How rude!

12
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,000
All right. C'mon, Kanade.

13
00:00:48,083 --> 00:00:49,458
[KANADE]
Don't be mean!

14
00:00:49,541 --> 00:00:51,666
What are you talking about?
I just bought you a crab.

15
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:54,500
Yay! I dub thee Crabita, and
you get to go home with me!

16
00:00:54,583 --> 00:00:57,541
[KAHO]
That's so cool, Kanade! Crabby!

17
00:02:34,708 --> 00:02:35,666
Hey, Taga.

18
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,208
Thanks for getting me Crabita!

19
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:38,291
[TAGA]
Don't thank me.

20
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:40,333
Echizen crabs are
expensive as hell.

21
00:02:40,416 --> 00:02:42,541
I'm gonna bill your dad
for that later.

22
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:44,000
[KANADE]
You seem mad.

23
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:45,708
Are you mad?

24
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:48,208
Is it 'cause I wanted
you to buy Crabita?

25
00:02:48,291 --> 00:02:50,708
No, I'm not mad at all.

26
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:52,208
Just, uh...

27
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:55,000
I was just thinking maybe I
shouldn't've come out here.

28
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:56,500
It was silly of me.

29
00:02:56,583 --> 00:02:58,125
Yeah, but if you hadn't come,

30
00:02:58,208 --> 00:03:00,500
I'd never would've
made it to Kaho.

31
00:03:00,583 --> 00:03:02,625
How can you say
something like that?

00:03:02,708 --> 00:03:04,291

Good question.

33
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:05,750
I don't actually know.

34
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:07,000
You're a grown-up,

35
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:09,291
and you don't
understand yourself?

36
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:11,208
Pretty much.

37
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:14,333
Kaho, Taga is
being super weird!

38
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:15,750
[KAHO]
I-Is he?

39
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:18,583
[TAGA] Kanade, the only
thing you have in life is time.

40
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:20,250
Wasting it on a
substandard woman

41
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:22,208
is the same as
wasting your life.

42
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:24,416
[KANADE]
Oh yeah! Treasure your life!

43
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,083
[TAGA]
Exactly!

44
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:29,375
[KAHO] At least he's
getting new material!

45
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:31,916
[KAHO]
Kanade...

46
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,208
He's sleeping on me!

47
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:35,541
Of course he's tired.

48
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:37,833
He already drove a while today.

49
00:03:37,916 --> 00:03:40,916
And so much has happened.

50
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,041
To be fair, I'm still
overwhelmed, too.

51
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:50,416
[KANADE]
Let's get married!

52
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,166
What did you say?

53
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:56,250
[KANADE] I said I wanna
marry you! Please?

54
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:00,416
That's so sweet...

55
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,291
[TAGA]
Actually, though...

56
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:04,666
...men have to be 18
and women have to be 16 

57
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,500
before they can
legally get married.

58
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:08,375
What? Who says I have to?

59
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:09,541
The law does.

60
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:12,000
Poop. I guess
my idea's out then.

61
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:14,291
[KAHO]
He got over that pretty quick!

62
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:16,083
[TAGA]
You've got plenty of time.

63
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:18,500
No one picks a husband
or wife in the fifth grade.

64
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:21,041
Besides, you'll be able to
find someone much better.

65
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:24,416
Better than Kaho?

66
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:29,500
[KAHO] Kanade? Are you
having second thoughts again?

67
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,416
[KANADE] I don't know what a
better woman would even be like.

68
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:39,375
Thanks, but...
I'll stick with her.

69
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:50,291
Kaho, if we can't marry now,

70
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:52,000
can we promise to do it later?

71
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,708
[KAHO]
Oh, Kanade...

72
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:55,916
Are you taking this
little proposal seriously,

73
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,625
Breadcrumb Baby?

74
00:04:57,708 --> 00:05:01,083
One day when you end up a
lonely old hag with 47 cats,

75
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:02,708
are you going to
hunt him down screaming,

76
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:05,333
"but we promised
we'd get married!"?

77
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:07,416
I'm not taking
it that seriously!

78
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,875
Why not? You should be!
I'm totally serious here!

79
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:13,125
You are?

80
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:16,958
Well, yeah.
Let's pinky swear. Okay?

81
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:19,916
Pinky swears are
forever just like marriage.

82
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,958
Now, me and Kaho are
gonna get hitched one day.

83
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:25,958
If you lie, you promise to
swallow a thousand needles,

84
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:27,791
and cut your pinky off!

85
00:05:29,541 --> 00:05:31,708
So it's a deal!

86
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:32,958
[KAHO]
Sure.

87
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,833

Um... what's wrong?

89
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,708
[TAGA]
Ugh. Yeah, that's shock.

90
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:47,708
Which isn't a huge surprise
when one considers his sister

91
00:05:47,791 --> 00:05:50,458
is dating a fifth grader
and promised to marry the kid.

92
00:05:50,541 --> 00:05:53,125
If I were him, I would've
killed myself already.

93
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:02,250
Let's go home. 'Kay?

Later, Kaho's brother!

Next time, I'll teach you
how to play hide-and-seek!

00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:14,375
Kanade, c'mon!

97
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:16,000
Can we go, already?

98
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:21,083

Still asleep.

00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:23,666
I wonder if he'll
wake up anytime soon.

100
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,791
If not, Taga will strike!

101
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:27,458
How am I going to avoid him?

102
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:29,958
Maybe I can just fake
sleep until we get there!

103
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:31,958
[TAGA]
It's funny...

104
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:34,708

backed off pretty quickly.

but, I guess we'll see.

Guess so.

107
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:46,333
[KAHO] Did he ask because
he's worried about me?

No, not Taga. Never Taga.

314
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:36,208
[KANADE] Oh, no.
You've got cake on your face!

315
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:42,416
[KAHO]
He just licked my cheek.

316
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,625
Who does that?

317
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:44,875
[KOTA screaming]

318
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:46,083
The air!

319
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:48,583
Way to put your back
into your punches, man!

320
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:51,250
[ARASHI] Kaho, you can go
ahead and have the first bath.

321
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:54,000
[KAHO]
Really? Well, if you say so.

322
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:05,625
[GIN]
When do we get to eat the crab?

323
00:16:05,708 --> 00:16:07,958
[KANADE] Never! No eating
Crabita. She's my friend!

324
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:10,583
[TOM] Um... she doesn't
seem to be anything.

325
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:12,041
[KANADE]
What's wrong, Crabita?

326
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:13,208
Hey, answer me!

327
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:15,541
Smile for me again!

328
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:17,666
[GIN] Will she recover
if you put her in water?

329
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,541
[JOJI] Only if ya got a
tank or somethin' big enough

330
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:21,541
for a crab this colossal.

331
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:22,666
[KANADE]
I do!

332
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:26,291
I'll just go put
her in the bathtub.

333
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:31,083
[KANADE]
Kaho!

334
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,041
[DAIKOKU]
You thought I was Kaho?

335
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:36,833
Too bad, fool. It's me!

336
00:16:36,916 --> 00:16:39,833
And all of her precious
bathwater shall be mine!

337
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:43,000
Hey, Kanade, did ya get
Crabita in the tub all right?

338
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:45,583
Hold up, what's with
the creepy dude?

339
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:47,708
Right? I don't even
know this old guy,

340
00:16:47,791 --> 00:16:49,333
so who knows why he's in there.

341
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:52,000
You do too know this old guy!
We just met!

342
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:54,291
Wait a second...
I'm not that old!

343
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:56,500
[KANADE] There we go, Crabita.
Rest easy, now.

344
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:57,750
[DAIKOKU]
Wait! Stop!

345
00:16:57,833 --> 00:16:59,500
What are you planning to
snip with those claws?

346
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:01,125
[screams]

347
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:06,916
[KAHO] I wonder why my
brother was in the bath.

348
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,875
And passed out naked, at that.

349
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:12,041
I bet he wanted
to take me back.

350
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:17,125
It'll be fine.
Kanade came to get me.

351
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:20,625
From now on, I can stay here
at Kasumi House with Kanade.

352
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:24,458
Kaho, did something
good happen to you?

353
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:27,125
Yep! I'm happy
that I can be with you.

354
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:28,166
It's good!

355
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:29,916
Me, too! I'm happy, too!

356
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,500
[KAHO laughs]
The feeling's mutual.

357
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:38,750
[KANADE] I'm making a
raft out of milk cartons...

358
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:41,125
[KAHO]
What's going on?

359
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:43,500
When did he come into my room?

360
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:45,875
[KANADE] I mean, it'll have
to be an underwater walk.

361
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:47,000
But then...

362
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:49,500
Then it came to me
out of like nowhere!

363
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:52,625
[KAHO] And how long have I
been standing here like this?

364
00:17:54,916 --> 00:17:57,875
In my underwear
like it's no big deal.

365
00:17:57,958 --> 00:18:00,000
[KANADE] Then, it'll be
like a real prop boat..

366
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:01,375
[KAHO]
What's wrong?

367
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:03,916
He's acting too normal.

368
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,583
And that's pretty much it.
Goodnight, sleep tight.

369
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:11,375
[KAHO]
What is this... this feeling?

370
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:15,541
Of course he'd
leave the door open.

371
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:29,958
[KAHO]
He saw me. Taga saw me!

372
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:34,333
[KAHO] Kanade saw me like
this and didn't react at all.

373
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:36,833
Now Taga's gotten
an eyeful, too.

374
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:43,875
[KAHO]
Why? I hate this!

375
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,125
[DAIKOKU] Daikoku Nikaido,
29-year-old Taurus

376
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:51,458
with blood type A.

377
00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:53,708
I still don't understand
how this strange person

378
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:55,500
ended up living in my closet.

379
00:18:59,541 --> 00:19:00,583
[KAHO]
Daikoku?

380
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:01,750
Hey, Kaho.

381
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:03,250
Good mor-Nintendo.

382
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:05,708
Hi. And good morning
to you, Kanade.

383
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:07,333
[KANADE] Hey, has
anyone seen Crabita?

384
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:09,541
She's not in the tub.

385
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:11,375
Kanade! Look, it's seaweed!

386
00:19:11,458 --> 00:19:13,708
Hooray seaweed! Yay, am I right?

387
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:15,541
Yay! Seaweed!

388
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,500
Oh, no...

389
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:31,291
[KANADE crying]

390
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:34,000
[sobbing loudly]

391
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:35,458
[KANADE]
How could you?!

392
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:37,958
Crabita's not breakfast!
She was my friend!

393
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:40,500
[DAIKOKU] Keeping a pet
crab in the bathtub?

394
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:43,208
Wait! Crabita went back
to her Kanazawa waters

395
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:45,333
but sends you her love!

396
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:47,833
Yeah, she wanted to have
her babies at home, so uh...

397
00:19:47,916 --> 00:19:49,583
[CHIAKI] All right, you two.
That's enough.

398
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:52,625
The truth is...

399
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:55,125
Humans survive by
receiving all kinds of lives.

400
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:57,083
Better to connect
our lives by eating them

401
00:19:57,166 --> 00:19:58,916
than just letting them rot.

402
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,166
Kanade.

403
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:02,583
Let this be a learning
experience for you.

404
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:04,125
You shut up!

405
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:07,000
If learning makes me fine with
what happened to my friend,

406
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:08,666
then I'd rather be dumb!

407
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,333
Adults are all the same!

408
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:12,541
You're all awful!

409
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:14,250
[KANADE]
I hate you!

410
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:15,500
Kanade, wait!

411
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:17,125
[DAIKOKU chuckles]

412
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:19,166
A man who'd cry
over a crab being eaten

413
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:21,083
isn't worth the chase.

414
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:22,666
After all, my dear,

415
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:25,083
we are talking about the same
child who saw me bathing naked

416
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:26,833
and believed I was you.

417
00:20:29,916 --> 00:20:33,083
An easy mistake to make
considering her body, though.

418
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:34,041
Right?

419
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:35,375
[KOTA]
T-T-Taga?

420
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:37,666
Y-Y-You sound like
you've seen it b-before!

421
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:40,416
[DAIKOKU] Perhaps you suffer
from low blood pressure?

422
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,000
Mornings must be rough for you.

423
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:44,208
Oh no, fellas,
I saw it, all right.

424
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:46,333
Yeah, I saw it just fine.

425
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:47,708
But with so little there,

426
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:50,583
I could hardly tell
if she was a woman.

427
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,416
Kanade saw, too, didn't he?

428
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:56,666
But sadly,
he didn't react at all.

429
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,916
Meanwhile, the disgusting
garbage girl before me

430
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,291
reacted in typical
pathetic style.

431
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:06,625
Oh, you know what
I just realized?

432
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:09,541
I bet Kanade doesn't even
think of you as a woman...

433
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:47,750
[KANADE]
Out of my way, Crabbonio!

434
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:49,750
Crabita is my girl!

435
00:22:49,833 --> 00:22:52,750
[JOJI laughs] Save the jokes
for after we molt.

436
00:22:52,833 --> 00:22:55,000
Crabita's mine!

437
00:22:55,083 --> 00:22:57,458
[TOM] Hey, don't forget
about ol' Snowcrab Smith!

438
00:22:57,541 --> 00:22:59,666
I came like a thousand
miles from the southwest

439
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:01,791
to see my honey, Crabita!

440
00:23:01,875 --> 00:23:03,416
[KANADE, JOJI]
But you're a snow crab!

441
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,166
[GIN] To be honest,
I just want to mate.

442
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:09,333
[JOJI, KANADE, TOM]
Don't be gross, Carl!

443
00:23:09,416 --> 00:23:10,791
[GIN]
A minor detail.

444
00:23:10,875 --> 00:23:14,166
But more importantly, I'm
related to the hermit crab.

445
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:16,375
[KANADE] Crabita!
Who's your one true love?

446
00:23:16,458 --> 00:23:18,125
[JOJI]
That'd be me, o' course!

447
00:23:18,208 --> 00:23:21,333
[TOM] Won't you accept
this man's pure heart?

448
00:23:21,416 --> 00:23:23,833
[KAZ] Look, you keep
calling me "Crabita,"

449
00:23:23,916 --> 00:23:25,916
but I'm actually a male.

450
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,250
[BOYS]
Huh?!

451
00:23:27,333 --> 00:23:30,333
"Echizen crab" is a brand
name for male snow crabs

Good grief.

Hey, was that my
only part? A crab?
