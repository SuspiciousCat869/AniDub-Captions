1
00:00:17,291 --> 00:00:18,333
[KAHO]
Thank you.

2
00:00:19,916 --> 00:00:22,208
[KAHO] Now that I've gotten used
to the food at Kasumi House,

3
00:00:22,291 --> 00:00:24,708
I've started to realize that
my family's breakfasts

4
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:26,166
weren't all that normal.

5
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:29,083
We haven't had snow crab
five ways even once.

6
00:00:29,166 --> 00:00:31,083
I actually prefer eating
what's served here

7
00:00:31,166 --> 00:00:32,291
in the morning.

8
00:00:32,375 --> 00:00:34,458
Well, except for one thing.

9
00:00:34,541 --> 00:00:37,458
Or several things, actually.

10
00:00:37,541 --> 00:00:40,291
There are thousands--no,
dozens of thousands of eggs

11
00:00:40,375 --> 00:00:43,666
and other organisms found
inside a female cod's belly.

12
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:47,125
Scientifically speaking,
it's a mass of cell nuclei.

13
00:00:47,208 --> 00:00:49,708
I really shouldn't be thinking
about it scientifically, though.

14
00:00:49,791 --> 00:00:52,875
It always squicks
me out when I do.

15
00:00:52,958 --> 00:00:55,958
I can't be the only one
who feels this way.

16
00:00:56,041 --> 00:00:57,833
There's enough left for seconds.

17
00:00:59,166 --> 00:01:01,458
[KAHO]
Come on. I can do this.

18
00:01:01,541 --> 00:01:03,708
All I need to do is brace
myself and gulp it down

19
00:01:03,791 --> 00:01:05,666
in one fell swoop before
I have the chance

20
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:06,916
to think about it.

21
00:01:08,791 --> 00:01:10,875
[squealing]

22
00:01:13,041 --> 00:01:14,541
[KAHO]
Done with that bite.

23
00:01:14,625 --> 00:01:17,333
On the bright side, I managed
to avoid turning into a merlion,

24
00:01:17,416 --> 00:01:18,750
so there's that.

25
00:01:18,833 --> 00:01:21,333
One more. Just one more to go.

26
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:24,958
[KANADE]
Kota! Arashi!

27
00:01:25,041 --> 00:01:26,708
Gimme your seaweed.

28
00:01:26,791 --> 00:01:28,250
Oh, sorry.

29
00:01:28,333 --> 00:01:29,875
Yeah, mine's all gone, too.

30
00:01:29,958 --> 00:01:30,875
[KANADE]
Are you kidding?

31
00:01:30,958 --> 00:01:32,750
Who eats their
seaweed that fast?

32
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:36,000
Kaho...

33
00:01:36,083 --> 00:01:37,458
Can I have yours, please?

34
00:01:37,541 --> 00:01:40,791
Kanade, I already told you
only one packet per person.

35
00:01:40,875 --> 00:01:42,625
[KANADE] Yeah, but there's
only six pieces in there!

36
00:01:42,708 --> 00:01:45,166
That's not enough for me.
I'm a growing boy!

37
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:47,333
I don't mind. Here.

38
00:01:47,416 --> 00:01:49,708
Sweet, thank you!
Oh, and this, too.

39
00:01:52,958 --> 00:01:54,375
[KANADE]
You're awesome, Kaho!

40
00:01:54,458 --> 00:01:56,625
[KAHO] I wonder if Kanade
ate that cod roe

41
00:01:56,708 --> 00:01:58,875
because he knew
I didn't like it.

42
00:01:58,958 --> 00:02:01,166
Aww, he's just so sweet.

43
00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:45,041
As if anyone would welcome a
pathetic little princess

44
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:46,333
like you.

45
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:51,291
Ignoring me?

46
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:52,458
Seriously?

47
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:54,250
You made how
you feel pretty clear.

48
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:57,125
Why do you care? Shouldn't
you be the one ignoring me?

49
00:03:57,208 --> 00:03:58,291
[TAGA chuckles]

50
00:03:58,375 --> 00:04:00,250
I'm just pointing out
how rude you are.

51
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:01,916
[CHIAKI] If you ask me,
not ignoring her

52
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,250
means you gotta
be kinda interested.

53
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:05,375
Or very.

54
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,791
Well, nobody asked you.
Mind your own business.

55
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:11,083
And let you off the hook?
Face it, man.

56
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:14,416
Your inability to leave her
alone is basically affection.

57
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,041
Don't you know the opposite
of "love" isn't "hate"?

58
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:19,833
No. The opposite
would be indifference.

59
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:23,166
Um... Chiaki, what
are you trying to say?

60
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:26,916
[CHIAKI] You want to be ignored,
but Taga can't ignore you.

61
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,041
Clearly, he's suffering
from unrequited love!

62
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:31,500
[KAHO]
Please stop it.

63
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:34,333
You're making things worse,
and now Taga is bound to--

64
00:04:34,416 --> 00:04:36,458
[TAGA]
Bound to what?

65
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:37,583
Like you?

66
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:41,416
[CHIAKI]
Shinohara and now Taga.

67
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,708
You sure are popular, Kaho.

68
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:46,250
[KAHO] Why would you
even bring up Shinohara?

69
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:47,958
But more importantly--

70
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:49,125
I don't know why
you think that,

71
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:51,208
but there's no way
Taga likes me.

72
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,333
Well, there might be.

73
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:54,125
There what?!

74
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:56,250
I found it strange myself, Kaho.

75
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:58,416
How is it I could care
for a clumsy, stupid,

76
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,500
poor little rich girl?

77
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:01,666
Yeah!

78
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,625
As if I would be
interested in pure trash!

79
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:05,666
If I was into anyone here,

80
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:08,708
It would be Kanade, not a
pathetic moron like you.

81
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:13,416
What in the world is
that supposed to mean?

82
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,958
He prefers Kanade over you.

83
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:16,416
How was that not obvious?

84
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,000
C'mon, Shinohara.

85
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:19,833
Come out of hiding
and let's hit it.

86
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:23,208
--[KOTA] Hey.
--[KAHO] Shinohara?

87
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:26,166
[CHIAKI]
Honestly...

88
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,166
[KOTA]
Good morning, Miss Nikaido.

89
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:29,333
Have a good one.

90
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:32,083
[KANADE]
Kaho!

91
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:33,541
[KAHO]
Oh, hi, Kanade!

92
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:38,416
So, today's the day we get
our first mission underway!

93
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,250
Yeah. We should do something
boyfriend and girlfriendy!

94
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:43,000
[KAHO]
Huh?

95
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:44,458
Wanna go on a date?

96
00:05:51,708 --> 00:05:53,208
[KAHO]
Of course.

97
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:54,625
[CHILDREN laughing]

98
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:56,708
Hurry! C'mon!

99
00:05:56,791 --> 00:05:59,333
[KAHO] I freeze up when I
see Kanade get rambunctious,

100
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:02,958
but I guess this is normal
for elementary school kids.

101
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:04,791
No wonder the idea
of seeing Kanade

102
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:08,291
when he's at
school terrifies me.

103
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:10,625
It's not every day you
see a high-school girl

104
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:13,750
waiting for her date...
with a fifth grader.

105
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:15,750
I must look like a total freak.

106
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:20,541
But I agreed to go
on a date with him.

107
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:22,250
If I don't show up
at our meeting spot,

108
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:26,041
Kanade's feelings might get
hurt, and I don't want that.

109
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:27,750
--[KANADE] Kaho!
--[KAHO] Kanade?

110
00:06:33,958 --> 00:06:35,291
[KANADE]
Sorry. Did you have to wait?

111
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:36,500
No!

112
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:38,291
Check it out! Me and
the other boys at school

113
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:40,583
have been all about
climbing poles lately.

114
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:42,750
Yeah, I can see that's a thing.

115
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:49,625
Wa-hoo! C'mon!

116
00:06:49,708 --> 00:06:51,625
You should climb up, too, Kaho!

117
00:06:51,708 --> 00:06:53,833
But, uh... I'm wearing a skirt.

118
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:56,166
[KANADE] You can see
Mt. Fuji from here!

119
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,708
I think I'll still pass. Thanks.

120
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:00,291
Suit yourself, then.

121
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:01,333
Now...

122
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:06,666
What do you say we get
this date officially started?

123
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,833
Um... By "date," you mean...?

124
00:07:10,666 --> 00:07:11,833
A date.

125
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:13,666
Right. But what kind?

126
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:16,166
The kind of date you'd
like to go on with me!

127
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,208
Huh?

128
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:18,250
What do a boy
and girl want to do

129
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:19,583
when they're with each other?

130
00:07:19,666 --> 00:07:21,250
'Cause honestly,
I don't have a clue.

131
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:23,500
With... each other?

132
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:24,791
[KAHO]
This is my first date.

133
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:27,833
I don't really know what
we're supposed to do.

134
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:30,625
Um... Probably... I'd say
a date would probably be

135
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:33,625
going somewhere or doing
something fun together.

136
00:07:33,708 --> 00:07:35,500
Something fun, huh?

137
00:07:35,583 --> 00:07:37,000
I got it! Let's go!

138
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:42,375
I'm gonna make sure you have the
funnest time ever today, Kaho!

139
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:44,166
Okay, thanks.

140
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:49,708
[KAHO] No one's ever put
it quite that way before.

141
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:52,583
I can't help but get
excited about our date now.

142
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,625
What do you think, Kaho?

143
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:09,583
[KAHO giggles]

144
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:12,750
These are a present from me.

145
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:20,250
That's right. Only the
finest date for you.

146
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:25,416
[KAHO]
That's ridiculously unrealistic!

147
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,583
Get out of your
fantasy world, Kaho!

148
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:32,166
Kanade's not the type to dress
like a prince and play the harp.

149
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,208
Don't forget this
beautiful, sensitive guy

150
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:37,708
is just a big, recorder-tooting
fifth grader.

151
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:40,791
[KAHO] Hey, Kanade,
where are we going?

152
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:42,291
To the park!

153
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:45,458
[BOTH laughing]

154
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:48,375
[KANADE]
What do you think, Kaho?

155
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:58,416
[KANADE] That's right.
Only the finest date for you.

156
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,250
[KAHO]
There I go again!

157
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:05,458
I know this is my first date,

158
00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:07,791
but my fantasies are
getting out of control.

159
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:09,375
I need to face reality.

160
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:12,000
[KANADE]
Hey, Kaho! Over here!

161
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:14,416
Oh! 'Kay!

162
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,625
We should do this together!

163
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:18,125
[KAHO]
Hello, reality!

164
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:20,416
It's so nice to see you again.

165
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,791
[KANADE]
Bring me a bucket of water.

166
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:26,041
--[KAHO] What?
--The spigot's over there.

167
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:27,208
Okay.

168
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:32,750
[KANADE]
Awesome. Five more!

169
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:33,875
[KAHO]
Okay.

170
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:42,791
[KANADE] Next, we gotta start
building up our mountain.

171
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:43,833
Okay.

172
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,916
Pick all the pebbles
out of the sand.

173
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
That way, our mountain
won't collapse on us.

174
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:49,083
'Kay.

175
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:50,250
[KANADE]
And once the sand is piled up,

176
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:51,958
give the surface a
good smack, you know,

177
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:53,500
to make sure it's
nice and hard.

178
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:55,583
Then, you can use that
sticky sand to reinforce

179
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:58,125
the mountain wherever it looks
like it's gonna be too weak.

180
00:09:58,208 --> 00:09:59,166
'Kay.

181
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:02,958
[MAN] There's this new
café by the station.

182
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:04,583
[WOMAN]
Let's check it out.

183
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:06,083
--Do you wanna go now?
--[MAN] Sure do!

184
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:08,000
Oh, good! I'm so excited!

185
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:10,166
[KAHO]
What am I even doing?

186
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:14,250
[KANADE] Hey, you're
really good at this, Kaho!

187
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:15,708
Thanks to you,
today's sand mountain

188
00:10:15,791 --> 00:10:18,375
is like the best balanced
one I've ever made.

189
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:21,041
Believe me. I've built a
ton of these in my life,

190
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:23,333
but none have been
this awesome before.

191
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,708
Kanade, you've got a
little sand on your face.

192
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:29,666
What? Will you get it off?

193
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,541
[KAHO]
Hang on a sec.

194
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:33,250
Ow, Kaho, that hurts.

195
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:35,458
Sorry, it's really
stuck on there.

196
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:38,375
Okay, you're set.

197
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:40,750
Thank you.

198
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:42,000
I think we're finally
done building

199
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:43,583
our awesome sand mountain.

200
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:45,333
That means time
to dig the tunnel!

201
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:46,541
The tunnel?

202
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:48,416
Don't worry.
This mountain is super sturdy.

203
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,916
There's no way a tunnel
could ever make it fall down.

204
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,208
I'll start here on this side.

205
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:55,208
You can dig from
over there if you want.

206
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:56,375
Okay!

207
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:02,833
This is a solid
mountain, all right.

208
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:05,125
Need some real elbow grease
to dig to the middle.

209
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:06,750
Oh. 'Kay.

210
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:20,875
[KANADE]
Oh, yeah, Kaho.

211
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:23,208
Try not to make the
tunnel hole too wide.

212
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:24,541
Oh!

213
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:26,375
[KANADE] See if you can
jam your hand all the way

214
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:27,583
into the center.

215
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:28,625
Okay.

216
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:35,708
We're connected!

217
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:43,250
[CHIAKI] Well, look at
you two lovebirds.

218
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:44,750
[KANADE]
We are on a date, you know.

219
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:47,291
[CHIAKI]
Oh, really? Nice.

220
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:49,041
[KANADE]
Hey, what's up, Arashi?

221
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,833
[ARASHI]
Hey, not much, kid!

222
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:52,583
[KAHO] Um, it's not
like a date date.

223
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:54,791
It's more like a... play date.

224
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,000
Seems pretty sweet to me.

225
00:11:58,083 --> 00:12:00,208
Especially compared to my date.

226
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:02,958
[ARASHI]
Oh, yeah, work it, Li'l Renren!

227
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:04,875
Fantastic! Fierce!
Give me more!

228
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:06,791
Wait. Let me move
it to a better pose.

229
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:08,083
[ARASHI] What do you
think you're doing?!

230
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:09,541
Get your sandy mitts off that!

231
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:11,208
Don't you know this
is my ultra-super-rare

232
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:13,833
limited-first-edition "Poseable
Cat-Ear Li'l Renren,

233
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:14,958
Bashful Version"?

234
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:16,625
The Bashful Version, Kanade!

235
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:17,916
[KANADE]
What about this one?

236
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,458
I see someone's panties!

237
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:23,000
Stop! No peeking under
that skirt, you monster!

238
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:26,833
These little photoshoots are a
shockingly regular thing for us.

239
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:28,708
How nice for you...

240
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:29,875
[CHIAKI]
So what's the deal?

241
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:32,958
This park not good
enough for your dates?

242
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:33,958
[KAHO]
Well...

243
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:37,000
Um, doesn't it bother you?

244
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:37,875
What do you mean?

245
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:40,875
Uh... It's just... nothing.

246
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:44,000
Oh, you mean Arashi being a big
disappointment as a boyfriend?

247
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:45,583
[KAHO]
No! I...

248
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:47,666
[CHIAKI] It's cool.
He's hot, though, isn't he?

249
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:50,875
[KAHO]
Huh? Um... I guess so.

250
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:52,416
[CHIAKI]
Well, that's all that counts.

251
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,041
[KAHO]
Is it?

252
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:56,458
[CHIAKI] I think
Kanade's cute. Don't you?

253
00:12:56,541 --> 00:12:58,208
[KAHO]
Uh, well, I...

254
00:12:58,291 --> 00:13:00,666
Yes, he's very cute.

255
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,500
Then you've got
nothing to worry about.

256
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:05,208
I know this whole Kanade only
being in elementary school thing

257
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:07,000
freaks you out,
but I honestly don't think

258
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:08,666
it's a problem at all.

259
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:11,041
[KAHO] You're right,
it does freak me out.

260
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:13,750
Although, I do have a
good time with him.

261
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:15,291
That being said,
our "date" today

262
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:17,750
is not what I'd call romantic.

263
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:19,708
It doesn't matter
if it's romantic.

264
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:21,208
There are just as
many kinds of dates

265
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:22,833
as there are couples, right?

266
00:13:22,916 --> 00:13:24,000
[KAHO]
I guess so.

267
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:25,041
Besides...

268
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:27,333
Arashi is ridiculously
sweet to me.

269
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:28,375
[KAHO]
Huh?

270
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:33,208
Nothing.

271
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:34,625
You know what?

272
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:37,125
Kanade's sweet.
They're both sweet.

273
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:38,375
[KANADE]
Laser eyes!

274
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:39,916
[ARASHI] Stop!
You're gonna pull his eyes out!

275
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,333
Seriously, stop it.
You'll knock his butt off!

276
00:13:42,416 --> 00:13:43,666
Come on, man,
what are you doing?

277
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,000
You're supposed to be on a date!

278
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:46,708
You can't just leave your
girl hanging like this!

279
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:48,125
[KANADE]
Oh, yeah. That's right!

280
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,291
Kaho. Listen.
Our mission's complete.

281
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:53,875
Now on to the next one!

282
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,375
It is? Next one?

283
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:01,416
[KANADE]
Here we are!

284
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,541
It's Kobayashi's!

285
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:05,541
A penny-candy store?

286
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:07,583
[giggles]

287
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:09,333
[TOM, GIN]
Hey, it's Kanade!

288
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:11,375
I didn't know you guys
were hanging out here!

289
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:12,708
Surprise!

290
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:15,333
Wait, aren't you supposed
to be on a date today?

291
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:18,166
We are, and we're smack
in the middle of a mission.

292
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:20,208
I brought her to one
of my favorite stores.

293
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:22,125
That way, she'll get
to know me better.

294
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:23,541
I get it.

295
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:25,041
What you're saying is you
came to pay your respects

296
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:26,791
to the counter hag.

297
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:28,125
What's a "counter rag"?

298
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:30,625
Is that a new kind
of candy or something?

299
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:32,125
They got a real
famous counter hag

300
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:33,583
who sits up at the front.

301
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:34,750
Who're you callin' a hag,

302
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:36,625
you snot-nosed
juvie nincompoops?

303
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:39,125
If you keep spittin' on my
candy without buyin' any,

304
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:41,416
I'll spank your
spoiled butts myself!

305
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,750
[TOM]
There it is!

306
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:45,083
The counter hag threatens
us with violence again!

307
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:46,416
Hello, ma'am.

308
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,583
[CLERK] Oh, Kaz! I didn't
know you were here, too!

309
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:50,875
Here, sweetheart, have
a sucker on the house.

310
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:52,541
Counter hag has
a crush on Kaz

311
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:54,791
because he's our
resident old-lady killer.

312
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:59,083
[KAHO]
Wow! These take me back!

313
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:01,208
[TOM]
Kanade!

314
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:02,416
Oh, no! Are you hurt?

315
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,958

00:23:09,875 --> 00:23:11,666
I am not lame!

474
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,750
And what does "icy meat stew"
even mean?

475
00:23:13,833 --> 00:23:15,708
Hi! Mice to neat you.
Om Nom Kaz!

476
00:23:15,791 --> 00:23:16,750
What's wrong with you?

477
00:23:16,833 --> 00:23:19,208
Hi-ho! Nice to eat you,
Om Nom Kaz!

478
00:23:19,291 --> 00:23:22,125
You guys need serious help!

479
00:23:22,208 --> 00:23:23,875
Listening score: zero.

480
00:23:23,958 --> 00:23:26,666
So now it's the
miso-paste penalty.

481
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:32,541
[KOTA] These visuals are not
what I'd call acceptable for TV!

482
00:23:32,625 --> 00:23:34,458
Poop head! Poop head!

483
00:23:34,541 --> 00:23:36,333
Till next week. See you!

484
00:23:36,416 --> 00:23:37,666
See you!

485
00:23:40,125 --> 00:23:41,208
[RENREN]
Renren here!

486
00:23:41,291 --> 00:23:43,583
Coming up on
<i>First Love Monster</i> .

487
00:23:43,666 --> 00:23:46,916
[mumbling incoherently]

488
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,500
[RENREN]
All that, and more!

489
00:23:48,583 --> 00:23:50,958
Next time:
"Sought-After Undies"!

490
00:23:51,041 --> 00:23:52,291
And now for a match!

491
00:23:52,375 --> 00:23:54,250
Renren, paper, scissors!
