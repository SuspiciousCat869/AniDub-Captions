1
00:00:26,916 --> 00:00:29,291
[KANADE] If you're not
gonna eat this, I'll take it.

2
00:00:29,375 --> 00:00:30,625
Hold on!

3
00:00:30,708 --> 00:00:33,000
I was saving mine for last
because I love it most.

4
00:00:36,916 --> 00:00:37,958
What? You okay?

5
00:00:38,041 --> 00:00:39,500
[KANADE]
Say that again, would you?

6
00:00:39,583 --> 00:00:40,750
Say what?

7
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:43,333
[KANADE] Why you haven't
eaten your seaweed yet.

8
00:00:43,416 --> 00:00:45,958
Uh... Because I love it most?

9
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,291
Okay. It's in there now.

10
00:00:50,375 --> 00:00:52,250
I just memorized the way
you looked and sounded

11
00:00:52,333 --> 00:00:55,166
when you said "love" to me.

12
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:57,500
[KAHO] You know I was talking
about the seaweed, right?

13
00:00:57,583 --> 00:00:59,583
[KANADE]
Of course I do.

14
00:00:59,666 --> 00:01:00,875
But that's not the point.

15
00:01:00,958 --> 00:01:03,625
A guy can still dream,
can't he? [laughs]

16
00:01:03,708 --> 00:01:06,208
C'mon, let's go.
We're gonna be late.

17
00:01:06,291 --> 00:01:09,875
[KAHO] I do like seaweed,
but I like something else more.

18
00:01:12,958 --> 00:01:15,291
[KAHO]
Oh, Kanade. You're so dumb.

19
00:02:56,833 --> 00:02:58,875
Jeez, this rain
came out of nowhere.

20
00:03:01,666 --> 00:03:03,708
Crazy.

21
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:05,833
[KAHO]
Our shoulders are so close.

22
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:08,500
--[thunder crashes]
--[KAHO screams]

23
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:09,541
[KANADE]
Kaho!

24
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:20,166
Have I ever mentioned...?

25
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:21,791
You have perfect skin.

26
00:03:23,583 --> 00:03:25,541
[whimpers]

27
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:27,875
[KAHO]
I think I twisted my ankle.

28
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:34,000
Well, better hang on.

29
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:43,791
[KAHO]
Kanade's heartbeat...

30
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:46,916
And his hot breath...
they're surrounding me.

31
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,083
What's next?

32
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:50,375
'Cause I want to stay
like this forever!

33
00:03:57,875 --> 00:03:58,750
[KANADE]
All right.

34
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:00,708
That ought to do the trick.

35
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:02,958
Uh, thank you
for this, Kanade.

36
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:05,250
You're really good at
first-aid stuff, huh?

37
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:06,666
Kinda.

38
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:09,583
I'm aiming for Tokyo University,
so I'm studying a lot.

39
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:14,541
[KAHO]
A rainbow!

40
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:17,375
Look, Kanade, a rainbow!

41
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:19,458
[KANADE]
You know what they say, Kaho.

42
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:22,333
You can find treasure
at the end of a rainbow.

43
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:26,916
It's funny. Ever since we met,
I've seen another rainbow--

44
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,125
the one in my heart.

45
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:30,958
And my treasure?

46
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:32,375
My treasure is you.

47
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:37,916
That's so, so sweet.

48
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,958
[KANADE] We don't want
your sprain to get worse.

49
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:41,916
Rest here in the
nurse's office, okay?

50
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,791
I'll get my teacher's
permission to leave early

51
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:44,791
and come get you.

52
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:46,833
We'll go home together.

53
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:49,166
[KAHO]
You're gonna come with me?

54
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:53,375
You gotta have a hero to keep
the treasure safe, right?

55
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:54,416
[KAHO yelps]

56
00:04:56,666 --> 00:04:58,208
Never know when a
bad guy might show up

57
00:04:58,291 --> 00:04:59,666
and try to steal it.

58
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:06,458
Speak of the devil...

59
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:08,583
Looks like a bad guy
just showed up.

60
00:05:11,416 --> 00:05:14,458
That's certainly no way to
speak to your teacher, Kanade.

61
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:17,208
[KANADE]
Hold up.

62
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:41,791
[KANADE]
I won't let you take Kaho.

63
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:43,041
[TAGA]
Oh, you won't, huh?

64
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:45,041
Because I don't remember
asking your permission.

65
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:48,041
I'm worried.

66
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:49,375
Can Kanade win this?

67
00:05:49,458 --> 00:05:52,166
Why'd he agree to a
skate-off against Mr. Taga?

68
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,375
Hey, what gives, Kaz?

69
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:55,541
Don't you have any faith
in our boy Kanade?

70
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:58,041
It's not about having faith.

71
00:05:58,125 --> 00:05:59,250
It's about him.

72
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:01,333
Mr. Taga is legendary.

73
00:06:01,416 --> 00:06:03,541
He took the world by storm.

74
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:06,000
Kanade is skating
against Rollin' Atu-see!

75
00:06:08,916 --> 00:06:10,791
[CHORUS]
Atu-see!

76
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:13,583
Seriously?

77
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:15,916
Our Taga's that
Rollin' Atu-see guy?

78
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,708
[CHORUS]
Atu-see!

79
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:23,416
Yep, aka Mr. Rolling Eternity!

80
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,708
[CHORUS]
Eternity!

81
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:26,833
For real?

82
00:06:26,916 --> 00:06:28,083
That's the same guy
who was feared as

83
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:30,166
"Pandora's Box on Wheels"?

84
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:31,875
[CHORUS]
Wheels!

85
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:33,208
Look! It's started!

86
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,750
Canelé pastries
came out of Taga's pits!

87
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,750
Cool, Kanade's pits
just made mochi cakes!

88
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:09,125
Check it out!

89
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:12,000
Kanade's mochi cakes are
engulfing Mr. Taga's canelé!

90
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,041
[JOJI]
White canelé!

91
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:22,166
This is revolutionary!

92
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:25,500
I feel so much warmth,
and it's brimming with kindness.

93
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:33,166
[KAZ] There's soft mochi
inside the canelé, too?

94
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:34,750
This is the best thing ever!

95
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:35,833
But wait...

96
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:37,416
Could this mean
Kanade has been inside

97
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,250
Taga's soul all along?

98
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:40,416
Don't be ridiculous!

99
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:42,875
Chewy, crispy, chewy.

100
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:45,083
Kanade's heat is radiating
through Taga's canelé

101
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:46,500
both inside and out!

102
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:49,041
[JOJI] It's startin' to get
real, real hot in here!

103
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:13,083
[TAGA]
The earth gone white.

104
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:17,083
You were sketching out love
across this big campus of ours.

105
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:18,708
You win, Kanade.

106
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:24,083
Kaho? I got that
early dismissal form.

107
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:33,625
You may be sleeping now,
but listen.

108
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:36,916
If one day you feel like you
can't go on loving me alone,

109
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,666
that your love is too much...

110
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:39,708
Just wake up.

111
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:41,750
I'll be right there. 'Kay?

112
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:53,166
[KAHO] I've felt like that
for a long time, now, Kanade.

113
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:54,750
But you're not here.

114
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:05,625
[ARASHI] You seem
awfully glum today, Kaho.

115
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:08,500
Don't tell me something
happened with Kanade again.

116
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:09,875
[KAHO]
No, not really.

117
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:12,375
In the setting sun,
soft cheeks flush hotly pink.

118
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:13,375
Could it be love?

119
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:15,083
[ARASHI]
Ooh, nice poem, Kota!

120
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:17,458
I see you're keeping the spirit
of everyday verse alive,

121
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:19,250
you little balladist, you!

122
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:21,708
[KOTA] Kaho stimulates
my creative heart.

123
00:09:21,791 --> 00:09:23,916
That expression
of hers was sublime.

124
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:29,375
A rather fine poem,
if I do say so myself.

125
00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:31,708
Mayhaps I'll submit it to
the poetry corner section

126
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:33,166
in our local daily rag.

127
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:36,125
No! Please, you can't!
That would be too embarrassing!

128
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:38,166
All right, as long as
you speak of the worry

129
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:41,375
hidden in your heart,
then I shan't submit it.

130
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:42,958
It's just Kanade.

131
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:45,666
He's way too dazzling.

132
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,250
Sorry! I couldn't help it.

133
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:49,583
You had the most captivating
look on your face.

134
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:50,833
You know, Kaho...

135
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:52,625
I've got an exhibition
coming up in New York.

136
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:54,458
Would you model for me? Come on!

137
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:56,083
I haven't taken my
showpiece photo yet,

138
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:57,625
and you'd be perfect.

139
00:09:57,708 --> 00:10:00,041
Here in the setting sun,
tears begin to fall.

140
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:02,250
Surely this is love.

141
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:04,625
Arashi, take a look
at Chiaki, please.

142
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:07,000
Oh, Arashi, are you saying
you're going to make Kaho

143
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:08,416
your new model for the show?

144
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,791
Because I just, um...

145
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:11,291
I don't want you to!

146
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:13,500
Can't you let me be the
only one in your viewfinder?

147
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:16,166
I want to be the only model
in your heart so bad, Arashi!

148
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,041
Finally, you've told me
how you really feel

149
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:19,666
about us, Chiaki.

150
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,166
Come on, darling,

151
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:25,208
you know my lens is always
focused on you and you alone!

152
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,416
[CHIAKI]
Oh, Arashi!

153
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,083
How sweet! I want to
be like them some day.

154
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:30,958
Don't you, Kota?

155
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:32,833
My, what a sad story.

156
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:35,875
Here I sit the
unattached "lonely-only."

157
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:38,750
What? But you're popular
with the girls, Kota!

158
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:39,833
[chuckles]

159
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:41,375
I am a poet, after all.

160
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:43,708
Poets and romance
don't really mix.

161
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:45,958
It's quite the struggle,
I must confess.

162
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:48,625
But I'll be partnered with
poetry for a while longer.

163
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:06,291
--Hey.
--Kanade, what are you doing?

164
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:07,375
Not so loud.

165
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:09,125
My manager's out
there looking for me.

166
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:11,541
Kanade? Where are you?

167
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:13,208
Hey, Kanade!

168
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:15,083
Hold on. Your what?

169
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:16,541
I'm sorry, Kaho.

170
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:20,250
I've kept it from you all
this time, but I'm an idol.

171
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:22,625
My dad runs a talent agency.

172
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:24,625
He first let me on the lot
when he needed someone

173
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:26,541
to play a background character.

174
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:28,541
and then it just
snowballed from there.

175
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:33,458
[KAHO]
An idol?

176
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:37,791
Girls squeeing at events,
squeeing at meet-and-greets,

177
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:40,083
squeeing at magazine interviews,

178
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:43,041
squeeing whenever
he says poop or wiener...

179
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:45,958
He's that kind of idol? Why?

180
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:49,250
Why does this make my
heart hurt all of a sudden?

181
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:52,791
Here, I thought he was
mine and mine alone.

182
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:53,875
Listen.

183
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:55,041
Yeah, what's up?

184
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:56,833
There's, um...
there's this preview event

185
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:59,291
for the premiere of a
drama that I'm starring in.

186
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:01,583
I'll perform there, like
reenacting key scenes

187
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:03,083
and that kind of thing.

188
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:05,750
I wanted to let you know I
have to do a kiss scene, too.

189
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:09,375
Oh, no, you will? How does
your drama's kiss scene go?

190
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:10,541
[KANADE]
Like this.

191
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:16,750
What are you doing, Kanade?
Don't kiss me there!

192
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:18,500
All right.
Where should I kiss?

193
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:20,375
Don't say that! It's not fair!

194
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:22,333
You're always winding me up.

195
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:25,125
Like earlier,
in the nurse's office.

196
00:12:25,208 --> 00:12:28,125
[KANADE]
So... you heard my confession?

197
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:34,125
I guess my secret's out.

198
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:35,833
Which way do I turn now?

199
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:37,625
Jeez. I'm so lame.

200
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:39,083
You're so not lame!

201

You're super cool, Kanade!

202
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:45,250
Whoa, Kanade, your ears
just started turning red.

203
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:47,000
Which is only because
what you're saying

204
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:48,625
makes me want to jump for joy!

205
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,416
Honestly.

206
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,083
I've been meaning to ask you.

207
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:56,875
Kaho...

208
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:58,500
Will you be my girlfriend?

hold such happiness.

00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:12,500
I smiled, looking like
I was about to cry.

Don't get too close.

So I must go on a journey.

marry Sadako one day.

[KANADE]
Sadako's a human-faced dog!

If you're bitten

you'll turn into one.

All that "poop"
and "wiener" talk!

00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:02,208
poop wiener and had
no pooping reaction!

318
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:06,041
Poop! Wiener! Poop! Wiener!
Poop! Wiener! Poop! Wiener!

319
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:07,166
I don't get it.

320
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:09,125
Why are those words so funny?!

321
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:11,291
What's so great about poop
and wieners, anyway?!

322
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:12,625
Poop!

323
00:17:12,708 --> 00:17:13,708
Wiener!

324
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:21,708
[KANADE laughing]

325
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:26,458
You're awesome, Kaho!

326
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:28,666
You just said so many
poops and wieners!

327
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:31,166
[laughing]

328
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,625
Oh, no. I'm sorry.

329
00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:36,208
Man, that was so funny.

330
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:37,750
Why did I complain like that?

331
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:40,625
I didn't mean...
I'm such a loser.

332
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:42,500
Hey, no calling
yourself a loser.

333
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:43,625
You remember?

334
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:56,625
Yes, I remember.

335
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:58,833
But hey, randomly saying
"poop" and "wiener"

336
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:00,500
is like the funniest thing ever!

337
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:02,541
I'm so lucky,
'cause I've got you!

338
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:06,166
[KAHO crying]

339
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:08,250
That girlfriend of his
is a real piece of work.

340
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:10,833
Is that what grown-up women
do to tell dirty jokes?

341
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:13,041
Well o' course. That's why
I fell for Kaho darlin'

342
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:14,166
in the first place.

343
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:15,375
Wait, Kaho baby?

344
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:18,041
No, Kaho poopie poop poop!

345
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:19,333
Kaho-poopie poop-poop!

Kaho-poopie poop-poop!
Kaho-poopie poop-poop!

349
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:27,166
[ARASHI]
Hey there, kiddos!

350
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:29,750
The afternoon events
are just about to begin.

351
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:30,791
[TAGA]
Kanade.

352
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:33,875
Relax and enjoy the festival.

353
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:35,833
Go win some stuff.

354
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:37,916
Thanks! You know I will, Taga!

355
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:33,291
[SHUGO]
Hey, everyone. The meat's ready!

356
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:34,375
[ALL]
Thank you!

357
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:38,541
Hey, I'll take
some meat, wiener!

358
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:39,875
Me, too, wiener!

359
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:41,416
Looks good, wiener!

360
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,875
It's crazy out here, wiener!

361
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:46,041
What's that?

362
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:47,500
What on Earth are
you guys saying to me?

363
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:49,083
Wiener!

364
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:51,458
[KAZ] Oh, that's just a little
game they picked up from Kaho.

365
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:54,166
What? Well I didn't
see that coming at all.

366
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:55,875
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah!

367
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:58,250
The smell of your lower half
is a feast unto itself.

368
00:19:58,333 --> 00:19:59,791
Thanks for the appetite, Shugo!

369
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:01,125
Mafuyu! Please stop!

370
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:03,041
That kind of thing could
get you in big trouble!

371
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:05,166
[KANADE]
C'mon, Sadako, sit up and beg.

372
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:06,291
Poop, wiener.

373
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:08,041
Do I understand
correctly that the dog

374
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:10,083
is coming to stay
at Kasumi House?

375
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:11,208
[KAHO]
Yep.

376
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:12,458
Taga was nice enough
to work things out

377
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:14,125
with Mr. Takahashi.

378
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:16,875
You know what?
From this distance,

379
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:19,625
Kanade kind of looks as though
he could be the ideal boyfriend.

380
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:22,541
He does, doesn't he?

381
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:26,041
But still... I don't
wanna just look at him.

382
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:27,541
I need more.

383
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:32,458
And I think Kanade can be so
much more than some hot guy.

384
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:34,041
Suit yourself.

385
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:36,083
Oops, looks like
I'm out of meat.

386
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:37,583
C'mon, Arashi, let's go.

387
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:39,333
We should grab seconds
before it's all gone.

388
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:41,208
[ARASHI]
Sure. Whatever you say, Chiaki.

389
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:46,500
[KANADE]
Hey, Kaho.

390
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:47,750
[KAHO]
Great news.

391
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:49,916
I mean, about getting
to keep Sadako.

392
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:54,083
[KANADE]
It's kinda weird.

393
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:56,166
When I saw Sadako
abandoned like that,

394
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,666
I thought she
looked just like you.

395
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:01,166
It was as if you
had been abandoned.

396
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:03,291
So I couldn't leave
her all alone.

397
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:09,333
[growling, yapping]

398
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:12,166
You really think
we're that much alike?

399
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:13,291
For sure!

400
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:17,916
[KANADE]
Sadako. Kaho.

401
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,125
Let's all stay together forever!

402
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:24,583
[KAHO] He's so cool it makes
me almost uncomfortable!

403
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:28,000
[NARRATOR] The nonsense he says
sometimes leaves me speechless.

404
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:29,875
But that's my Kanade.

405
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,500
[NARRATOR]
Thank you, Kanade.

406
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:34,750
For meeting me.

407
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:37,458
And thank you for
making me your girlfriend.

408
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:40,875
[KANADE]
Here, Kaho!

409
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:42,791
I won first place for you.

410
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:47,875
[KAHO]
Thank you!

411
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:49,541
Oh, Kanade!

412
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:51,458
[NARRATOR]
The monster called "first love"

413
00:21:51,541 --> 00:21:54,125
is still coming after me.

414
00:21:54,208 --> 00:21:58,166
But, now, I think I'm ready
for any attack it dishes out.

415
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:03,708
After all, I know I love Kanade
just the way he is right now!

416
00:22:09,208 --> 00:22:11,125
You guys, it looks like
Sadako's got a wiener!

417
00:22:11,208 --> 00:22:12,375
Definitely a wiener.

418
00:22:12,458 --> 00:22:14,333
Yeah, ain't no
mistakin' that wiener.

419
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:15,875
So then she's really a boy?

420
00:22:15,958 --> 00:22:19,333
Yup. The "ko" in "Sadako"
actually stands for "Cojones."

421
00:22:21,125 --> 00:22:22,291
[BOYS laughing]

422
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:24,625
Are you telling me
she's ugly and a boy?!

423
00:22:24,708 --> 00:22:27,416
[BOYS laughing]

424
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,916
[KANADE]
That's a good Cojones!

425
00:22:32,916 --> 00:22:34,375
[TAGA]
It's our last meeting,

426
00:22:34,458 --> 00:22:38,208
so I'll take this chance to
clarify something for everybody.

427
00:22:38,291 --> 00:22:40,416
I think of Kanade
a trillion times more

428
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:43,333
than that crappy,
gross, idiot girl does.

429
00:22:43,416 --> 00:22:46,500
When it comes to caring about
Kanade, I simply can't be beat.

430
00:22:46,583 --> 00:22:49,625
Ya can't get away with
sayin' that around me, buddy!

431
00:22:49,708 --> 00:22:50,875
With all due respect,

432
00:22:50,958 --> 00:22:52,916
I was far and away
more concerned than you.

433
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,833
In fact, no one was as concerned
for Kanade's humanity.

434
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:58,208
Ah! Stop it, silly puppy!
It tickles...

435
00:22:58,291 --> 00:23:00,375
[KAZ] Caught up in your
grown-up common sense,

436
00:23:00,458 --> 00:23:01,708
you'd made up your
mind at the start

437
00:23:01,791 --> 00:23:03,583
that Sadako wasn't human-faced.

438
00:23:03,666 --> 00:23:04,833
Not me.

439
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:07,000
I still considered the
possibility that he was.

440
00:23:07,083 --> 00:23:09,333
And if Kanade had
turned into that monster,

441
00:23:09,416 --> 00:23:11,166
I was ready to become one, too!

442
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:13,791
[RENREN] Whoops!
That's my "gyun" spot, sweetie!

443
00:23:13,875 --> 00:23:15,083
Well, I would've done it, too!

444
00:23:15,166 --> 00:23:16,708
Meanwhile, I had
decided to dedicate

445
00:23:16,791 --> 00:23:18,583
the rest of my life
to developing a drug

446
00:23:18,666 --> 00:23:20,916
that would turn you all
back to your normal selves!

447
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,875
C'mon, y'all really
are thinkin' too hard.

448
00:23:22,958 --> 00:23:25,916
Human-faced dog or no,
a Kanade is still a Kanade.

449
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,625
I, for one, could spend
the rest o' my life

450
00:23:27,708 --> 00:23:29,166
with a dog-Kanade.

451
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:32,000
He'd be my dog, and we'd live
together happily ever after!

452
00:23:32,083 --> 00:23:33,750
Kanade could never
be truly happy

453
00:23:33,833 --> 00:23:35,791
if he was stuck living
with the likes of you.

454
00:23:35,875 --> 00:23:37,791
Believe me, he would
most assuredly choose

455
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:39,125
to live as my dog.

456
00:23:39,208 --> 00:23:41,666
Ew! Not so close!
Your breath smells terrible! 

457
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:43,458
[KAZ]
No, Kanade is my dog!

458
00:23:43,541 --> 00:23:45,208
[TOM] He could be
a family dog with me!

459
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:46,416
A big family dog!

460
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,041
[GIN] He'd be way
happier as my dog!

461
00:23:48,125 --> 00:23:51,083
[overlapping chatter]
