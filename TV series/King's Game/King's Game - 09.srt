1
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:12,458
-What?
-I'm gonna teach her a lesson.

2
00:00:13,625 --> 00:00:15,291
I won't take anymore threats.

3
00:00:15,375 --> 00:00:17,791
I'm gonna prove to her
that we're stronger together.

4
00:00:17,875 --> 00:00:19,041
To do that...

5
00:00:20,875 --> 00:00:23,083
I need to have
lots of negative points.

6
00:00:23,166 --> 00:00:24,375
No stop!

7
00:00:26,125 --> 00:00:29,041
I'll give my entire
left hand to the King.

8
00:00:29,125 --> 00:00:32,166
Natsuko! What are you
gonna do now?

9
00:00:34,291 --> 00:00:35,666
No!

10
00:00:39,666 --> 00:00:42,583
[NOBUAKI]
Stop it. Please, you can't!

11
00:00:42,666 --> 00:00:44,458
Teruaki!

12
00:00:44,541 --> 00:00:46,166
One more left.

13
00:00:47,125 --> 00:00:49,000
Probably don't need
a thumb, anyway.

14
00:00:53,958 --> 00:00:55,833
All right, Natsuko.

15
00:00:55,916 --> 00:00:58,458
Give me and Nobuaki
our phones back.

16
00:00:58,541 --> 00:01:00,500
Or these are all yours.

17
00:01:00,583 --> 00:01:03,000
Five negative points
you'll have to make up somehow

18
00:01:03,083 --> 00:01:04,458
if you don't want to die.

19
00:01:04,541 --> 00:01:07,000
You talk a big game,
but can you do this?

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,625
Your entire right hand.

21
00:01:09,708 --> 00:01:12,833
You'll have to mangle every one
of your fingers to zero out.

22
00:01:14,583 --> 00:01:17,166
So, what's it gonna be?

23
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:51,458
[NATSUKO] If I do give you
your phones back,

24
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:54,041
then who are those
negative points going to?

25
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:56,458
[TERUAKI] My left hand
will never heal completely.

26
00:02:57,541 --> 00:02:59,916
I'm done.
My dream is over.

27
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:04,250
There's no point in me
living anymore.

28
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:08,000
I don't know what
I'd do with myself now.

29
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:09,458
Don't say that.

30
00:03:09,541 --> 00:03:10,916
Hurry it up!

31
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,666
Do you have the guts
to break your fingers

32
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,541
to save yourself from dying?

33
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:17,583
Fine, take the phones.
Who cares?

34
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:19,416
Will you get 'em?

35
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,041
I give one positive point
to Nobuaki,

36
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:36,000
four negatives to Natsuko,
and one negative to Aimi.

37
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:37,500
The hell?

38
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:39,708
You're up next, Natsuko.

39
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:41,750
You have to break
four fingers to live.

40
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:43,500
If I were you, I'd get crackin'.

41
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:45,166
That wasn't the deal!

42
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,833
You said you'd give
the points to yourself

43
00:03:46,916 --> 00:03:48,875
if I gave you back
your stupid phones!

44
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:52,000
No, you're very mistaken
about that.

45
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:54,708
All I said for sure was that
I wouldn't give you five.

46
00:03:57,833 --> 00:04:00,083
Or, you could always pass,
of course.

47
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:01,666
There are still
four people after you

48
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,458
who have to take turns.

49
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:06,458
Just four positive points
from them and you'll survive.

50
00:04:06,541 --> 00:04:07,875
Pretty risky move.

51
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:10,375
You'd have to trust
that each one of them

52
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,375
would be willing to sacrifice
a finger for you,

53
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:14,458
like I did for Nobuaki.

54
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:16,833
Do you think they care
about you that much?

55
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:18,041
Teruaki.

56
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:20,166
This rock did the trick for me.

57
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:22,166
Consider it a present.
[laughs]

58
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:24,791
[NATSUKO breathing shakily]

59
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:26,875
I don't need that thing.

60
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:33,500
-I pass.
-What'd you say?

61
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:34,791
A little louder, please!

62
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,541
Pass!

63
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:39,541
[TERUAKI chuckles] You're
too afraid to hurt yourself.

64
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:41,583
Even though you've
played with our lives

65
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:43,125
as if we didn't mean anything.

66
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:46,083
Do you honestly think any of us

67
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:47,916
are gonna step up
to protect you now?

68
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:52,791
Oh, yeah.
Have you figured out

69
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:55,791
why I gave one of the negative
points to Aimi and not you?

70
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:59,083
It's 'cause
she asked me to do it.

71
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:02,458
In fact, we had this whole thing
planned before you got here.

72
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:04,166
What is he talking about, Aimi?

73
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:09,083
Why are you scheming against me?

74
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:10,958
[RYOU]
That looks really bad.

75
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:13,041
Do you think you should go
to the hospital?

76
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:15,500
No. I wanna see
everything go down.

77
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:18,041
Are you sure?
I mean, I get it.

78
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:19,750
But you don't wanna
lose that hand.

79
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:22,791
Don't worry about it.
It's just some broken bones.

80
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:25,250
Besides, it's not like
I gave my left hand to Natsuko

81
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:27,166
and Aimi just to get
our phones back.

82
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:30,208
Sure, but
giving up your dream

83
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:31,875
to get some revenge
is a hell of a trade.

84
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:34,083
No, it's not like that.

85
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:36,625
Seriously.
This wasn't about revenge.

86
00:05:37,583 --> 00:05:39,750
We remember what you said
about the Game.

87
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:42,833
All of us have to come together
as a group to survive.

88
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:44,958
And to do that,
we need a real leader

89
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:47,333
who can guide us
through this nightmare.

90
00:05:47,416 --> 00:05:49,291
That's why he made this plan.

91
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:50,708
So the rest of us'll live.

92
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,625
-[MATSUOKA] I pass.
-[NOBUAKI/RYOU] Uh...

93
00:05:53,708 --> 00:05:55,750
[RIONA]
I pass as well.

94
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:57,458
[RINA]
Yeah, so do I.

95
00:05:58,541 --> 00:06:00,375
[NOBUAKI]
None of them gave fingers.

96
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:02,708
-So...
-It's my turn.

97
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:04,625
[NATSUKO]
Please, you've gotta save me!

98
00:06:04,708 --> 00:06:07,333
Unless you break the fingers
on your right hand, I'll die!

99
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:08,416
It's the only way!

100
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,000
Help me, Aimi!

101
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:13,500
Is that it?

102
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:15,541
Don't you have anything else
to say to me?

103
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,666
I don't want
to get killed this way!

104
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:20,375
Please, Aimi, I'm begging you.
Snap your fingers for me!

105
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:23,208
That's really all?

106
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:28,250
Well, I tried.

107
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:32,750
You know what?

108
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:34,625
This'll come in handy after all.

109
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:41,875
[NOBUAKI]
Aimi! Run!

110
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:45,250
[giggles]

111
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:53,708
[AIMI]
Tell me, Natsuko.

112
00:06:53,791 --> 00:06:56,291
What do you see
when you look at me right now?

113
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:57,791
What do I mean to you?

114
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,625
What Teruaki said was true.

115
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:03,125
I asked him to give me
one negative point.

116
00:07:03,208 --> 00:07:05,708
I wanted to know
if you would save me.

117
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:08,500
If you'd protect me
when my life was in danger.

118
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:12,750
I was ready to sacrifice my hand
for you no matter what.

119
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:15,916
All you had to do
was give me one positive point.

120
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,375
Simple as that. But no.

121
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:21,708
In the end, you only care
about yourself

122
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:23,166
and winning this, don't you?

123
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:27,125
I only wanted
to hear you say one thing.

124
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:29,833
That we were friends.
That's all.

125
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:34,541
Tell me, Natsuko.
Are we friends?

126
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:45,625
[screaming]

127
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:50,791
[AIMI crying]

128
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,166
You would go this far?

129
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,208
She's supposed to be
your best friend!

130
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:59,750
You won't stop me.
There's no way I can lose now!

131
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:01,875
You can't really be that stupid.

132
00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:03,541
Why would anyone
in their right mind

133
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:06,000
give you their positive points
after you did that to them?

134
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:07,708
Moron.

135
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:10,791
Shows how much you know about
how people react to extremes.

136
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:13,833
Times like this, you can push
someone to do anything.

137
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:16,791
Aimi! Think of everything
we've been through!

138
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:18,791
Hurry and give me those points!

139
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:20,833
No. Why?

140
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:22,750
Why are we hurting each other?

141
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:24,333
I thought we were supposed
to look out

142
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:27,791
for one another, Natsuko,
but you've hurt me so much.

143
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:30,291
Watch, when people
are staring into the void.

144
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:31,833
When they're at the edge,

145
00:08:31,916 --> 00:08:34,666
they don't make
rational decisions, Nobu.

146
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,583
You've seen it, too,
haven't you?

147
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,833
All the horrors
that I went through.

148
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:42,916
They taught me how easily
we can betray one another.

149
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,166
People say that they'll
help you, but it's just talk.

150
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,875
-Pretty lies.
-Shut your mouth!

151
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:52,500
But I'm different!
I can save you.

152
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:53,708
Isn't that right, Aimi?

153
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:55,791
The same way I did back then!

154
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:05,375
-Natsuko?
-Hey, Aimi.

155
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:07,208
Do you want to join
the track team?

156
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:09,791
It's a great way
to get to know new people.

157
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:12,458
Well, I'm not that
interested in sports,

158
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:14,875
plus I have asthma,
so I don't really run much.

159
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:17,708
That's why you should!
I actually did some research.

160
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:19,375
I learned that working
on breath control

161
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:21,416
and getting more
physically fit can totally help

162
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,916
with someone's asthma problems!

163
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Yeah, but I have no stamina.

164
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:29,416
No worries!
Everybody starts out that way.

165
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,208
Plus, I'll be there to cheer you
on the whole time!

166
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:35,416
I'll stay by your side.
Because we're friends!

167
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:43,458
No. Aimi, why?

168
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:46,708
I have to.
If I don't, Natsuko will die!

169
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:50,458
You can't be serious
right now, Aimi.

170
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:51,625
You still want
to protect her

171
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:53,000
even though
she ruined your hand?

172
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:55,416
She was just scared, that's all.

173
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,916
She was driven to the brink.
What else could she have done?

174
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:03,333
This is what it means
to care for someone.

175
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:05,708
This time, I'll be the one
to save Natsuko's life.

176
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:09,000
I just don't understand it.
Think, Aimi.

177
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:11,916
Can you honestly tell me
this is what friendship's about?

178
00:10:13,541 --> 00:10:15,291
To me, friendship's about...

179
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:18,000
our past.

180
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:19,083
[ALL gasp]

181
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,250
Look. You and I are always
gonna be friends, Natsuko.

182
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,916
And I'll trust you
no matter what happens.

183
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,083
I hereby give my four
positive points over to you.

184
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:35,875
Aimi, I'm sorry you had
to do that for me.

185
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:37,583
Thank you so much.

186
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:45,375
-[bones crack]
-[screaming]

187
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:47,375
Your thumb's the thickest one.

188
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:50,500
I bet that means it's pretty
hard to break on your own hand.

189
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:52,375
So I did it for you, my friend.

190
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:54,250
You're really gonna say
you did that for her

191
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:56,666
and not because you're
some kinda sick sadist?

192
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:57,833
Of course.

193
00:10:57,916 --> 00:10:59,416
After all, it was
the only way left

194
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,875
that I could save her life.

195
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:03,208
If I know her, I'm guessing
she was just going

196
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:04,750
to let herself die.

197
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:06,500
I couldn't allow that to happen.

198
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,791
[AIMI crying]

199
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:10,916
Now calm down, Aimi.

200
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,958
Give yourself the last point,

201
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:15,791
and you'll be back
at zero, perfectly safe.

202
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:18,041
Then this game will be over.

203
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:19,500
Natsuko?

204
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:24,208
Okay. I'll give one
positive point to myself.

205
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:28,708
It's over now.
We survived.

206
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:30,000
We're fine!

207
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:33,416
[crying]

208
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,083
[NOBUAKI]
This is wrong.

209
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:38,250
Natsuko, do you really think
this is what friendship is,

210
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:39,458
or is it all a ploy?

211
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:41,958
Either way, you're crazy.

212
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:45,916
-[AIMI continues crying]
-[phone beeping

213
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:51,791
[ALL murmuring]

214
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:15,916
Aimi, how bad is your hand?
Is it gonna be okay?

215
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:20,625
Natsuko, I have to ask.

216
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:22,250
Are you gonna change the way
you play the game

217
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:23,791
after what happened today?

218
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:25,791
Seeing what Aimi did for you
must have made you look

219
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:28,083
at your actions
differently, somehow.

220
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:30,500
What exactly
am I supposed to change?

221
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,208
And if I did play differently,
do you think

222
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:34,166
the King's Game
would suddenly just end?

223
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,458
We both know
what's gonna happen, Nobuaki.

224
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:39,875
Maybe my King's Game was
a little different than yours,

225
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:41,291
but, still.

226
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:43,000
The choices I had to make
in the end were clear.

227
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:45,250
Hold on. What was different
when you played?

228
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:47,708
Oh, I'll tell you that later.

229
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:49,833
First I have to make sure
to show the rest of our class

230
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:52,250
that this hope you have
of saving everyone is idiotic.

231
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:54,750
It's just gonna get them killed.

232
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:56,625
Get our class together.

233
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:59,125
We'll meet under
the Yatsuhashi Bridge real soon.

234
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:02,125
[NOBUAKI] You're still
the same twisted girl.

235
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:05,750
[grunts]

236
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:07,791
-What's that for?
-Sorry.

237
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:10,000
Just tryin' to lighten
the mood a little bit, you know.

238
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:11,416
And kicking me helps?

239
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:15,833
Whoa. Oh, man.
That's not lookin' so good.

240
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:19,291
Yeah. The doctor said
I'll never use it again.

241
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:24,000
Come on. Don't look so sad.

242
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:26,708
I don't regret a thing
I did back there.

243
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:29,291
Besides, my right hand is good.

244
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:30,958
I've still got
a lot to live for.

245
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:32,291
That's true.

246
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:35,708
We have to follow our dreams.

247
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:37,666
And I'm not giving up.

248
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,916
I'll become a stylist someday,
just with one hand.

249
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,166
Man, I'm gonna have to cut
your hair again soon, huh?

250
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:46,125
Sure.

251
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:48,000
Hey, wait.
Where's Ryou?

252
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:49,708
I figured he'd still be
out here.

253
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:52,250
Oh, actually,

254
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:54,625
he took off saying he wanted
to get you a present.

255
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:56,083
Just a little something

256
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:57,833
to celebrate you leaving
the hospital.

257
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:01,875
Wow. It's not like I even
had an overnight stay.

258
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:04,000
-But I appreciate it.
-It's nice.

259
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:05,708
And he'll be glad
to hear you're okay.

260
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:07,625
I've never seen such
a supportive friend.

261
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:08,833
[chuckles]

262
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,208
-[TERUAKI] Shall we?
-Yeah.

263
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:20,958
[MASATOSHI] Hey, man.
What'd they say about your hand?

264
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:22,833
It'll be just fine.

265
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:25,291
The doc said I should be good
as new in about two months.

266
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:26,416
[sighs]

267
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:29,416
We've got bigger things
to worry about right now,

268
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,875
like what we're gonna do next.

269
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:32,958
Even though I've played
the King's Game before,

270
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:35,791
I have no idea what
the next order's gonna be.

271
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,375
All I'm sure of
is that it's my goal

272
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:39,791
to keep any of us
from getting punished.

273
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:42,416
And since I don't know
how to end this game early,

274
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,250
right now we just gotta stick
together as long as we can.

275
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:48,916
Look, I won't ask you
to trust me.

276
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,375
But will you at least trust
each other going forward?

277
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:55,041
All you gotta do
is share your will to live.

278
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:58,000
Make sure you're always
helping each other out.

279
00:14:58,083 --> 00:15:00,083
-Please, guys.
-He's right.

280
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:02,416
I am not giving up
on my life yet.

281
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:06,333
We can survive this together.
I trust him. And all of you.

282
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:09,333
Well, if you insist.
I've got too much to live for.

283
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:11,250
Yeah, I'm not gonna let
some stupid text game

284
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:12,375
be the end of me.

285
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:14,416
-Me, neither.
-We can beat this.

286
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:19,333
-Thank you.
-Well, I think that settles it.

287
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:21,833
But we need you
to lead us Nobuaki.

288
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:23,958
Show us the best way
to get through this damn game.

289
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:25,750
-I'll try my--
-[NATSUKO] That's pointless.

290
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:28,166
[NOBUAKI]
Natsuko.

291
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:30,541
A leader just takes away
your free will.

292
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:33,208
The only one who can save you
from death is yourself.

293
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:36,291
-You really believe that?
-You're damn right.

294
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:38,791
We only have about ten minutes
before the next order

295
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:40,625
is due to come in
from the King.

296
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:43,708
So I suggest that you get ready
to play instead of whining.

297
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:45,125
What do you mean?

298
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:47,083
I'm sorry, are you gonna
run away with your tail

299
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:48,708
between your legs instead?

300
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:50,458
What kind of man are you--

301
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:55,500
It's obvious today didn't
affect you in the slightest.

302
00:15:55,583 --> 00:16:00,125
Think of what happened.
Teruaki. And Aimi, your friend.

303
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:02,375
They offered their lives
to prove a point.

304
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:04,958
I thought it would've opened
your eyes a little bit at least.

305
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:07,583
Opened my eyes?

306
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:10,541
You're the one who's walking
around blind in this game.

307
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:12,625
Do you know what I meant
when I said your insane hope

308
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:14,750
will end up
getting them all killed?

309
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:18,208
What is wrong with you?
You're just a liar.

310
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:20,500
You know only one person
can survive the game.

311
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:23,458
And even if you do survive,
it keeps going.

312
00:16:23,541 --> 00:16:25,583
So don't try to pretend
this will end happily.

313
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:27,916
We may as well start killing
to stay alive.

314
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,583
You're wrong. One day, all of
our efforts and research will--

315
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:32,291
Will you stop being so naive?

316
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:34,416
Hey, I've got
a question for you.

317
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,083
-What is it?
-If that's really how you feel,

318
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:40,166
then why'd you force Aimi
to live in the last game?

319
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,666
By your own logic, shouldn't
you have left her thumb alone

320
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,708
and simply watched her die?

321
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:47,291
I owed her a favor.
That's all that was.

322
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:49,875
I'm gonna let you in
on something.

323
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:51,875
Unlike him,
at the end of my game,

324
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:54,666
I had to kill the person
I hated the most.

325
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:57,916
Even now, just thinking about
them makes me want to vomit.

326
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,166
They toyed
with people's hearts,

327
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:02,875
ruined the lives
of everyone they crossed,

328
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:04,708
and died so easily.

329
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:09,041
There was one person
I really wanted to protect,

330
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:11,125
but they threw themselves
off of a cliff.

331
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:13,500
Without saying goodbye.

332
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:19,125
That was the hardest part.

333
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:21,333
All of a sudden,
they were just gone.

334
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:23,500
-Disappeared forever.
-Natsuko.

335
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:28,625
[phones beeping, chiming]

336
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:31,125
I win, Nobuaki.
One more down.

337
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:32,708
Uh...

338
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:38,541
But the text says
he broke the rules.

339
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:41,250
Are you telling me that you
somehow forced him to do it?

340
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:44,458
Kind of. I guess
you could say that.

341
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:46,083
No way.

342
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:49,833
[screams]

343
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:55,791
-[NOBUAKI] Teruaki!
-[gasping]

344
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:58,291
I'm sorry. Really.

345
00:17:58,375 --> 00:18:01,875
-I didn't see this coming.
-No. Why?

346
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:04,250
Why am I the one
who's being punished?

347
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,125
I did nothing wrong.

348
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:09,041
What rule did I break?

349
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:11,416
You're so dumb.
I shouldn't be surprised

350
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:14,041
that you didn't lock your phone
with some kind of security code.

351
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:16,541
While I had it, I just blocked
the King's number,

352
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:19,625
which, as you know,
is basically a death sentence.

353
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:21,708
The rules clearly say
you can't leave the game

354
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:23,041
partway through the fun.

355
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:24,916
We all know what
the goddamn rules are!

356
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
He did ask
why this happened.

357
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:28,583
And since I answered
his question,

358
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:30,250
he should be thanking me
right now.

359
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:32,333
-You murderer!
-[coughs, spits]

360
00:18:32,416 --> 00:18:33,541
Hang in there.

361
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:37,083
There's one good thing. Ryou.

362
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:39,583
At least he's not here
to see me dying.

363
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:41,666
He's too sensitive.

364
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:44,583
He couldn't handle
something like this.

365
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:46,166
So much blood.

366
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,333
It'd ruin him.

367
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:50,083
Come on, man,
save your strength.

368
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:52,166
[groans, gasps]

369
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:55,833
Sorry I couldn't do much
to help in the end.

370
00:18:55,916 --> 00:18:58,166
I guess this is it for me.
Goodbye.

371
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:01,458
You're wrong about that.

372
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:03,416
You gave me so much hope.

373
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,625
You filled all of us
with courage.

374
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:07,208
You brought us together.

375
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:10,083
You have no idea how much
you did for us, Teruaki.

376
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:14,375
Promise.
You won't give up. Ever.

377
00:19:14,458 --> 00:19:16,625
Survive. Finish this.

378
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:18,708
Take care of them.

379
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:19,750
Lead them.

380
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:22,958
One day...

381
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:24,875
I'm gonna cut...
[gasps]

382
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:26,500
...your hair again.

383
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:32,125
[body thuds]

384
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:34,333
[screaming, crying]

385
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:36,208
[BOY]
No!

386
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:46,000
What are you doing?
Stop it!

387
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:50,375
So, if you don't really
want to play,

388
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:52,083
then you should block
the King now.

389
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:54,750
It's the easiest way
to escape this hellish game.

390
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:57,708
-Simple as that.
-You did this! Not him!

391
00:19:57,791 --> 00:20:00,750
-You're a freakin' psychopath!
-Oh, am I?

392
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:02,416
Well, at least I'm still alive.

393
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,166
What the hell is wrong with you?

394
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:06,750
You killed him.

395
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:09,416
No one has the right to steal
someone else's life like that.

396
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,166
Teruaki didn't want to die.
He still had dreams

397
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:14,291
and a future
he was looking forward to.

398
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:16,916
Please, we both know
that's not true.

399
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,916
His hand was never gonna heal.

400
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,250
He just didn't want to accept
that he was finished.

401
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:23,833
In fact, he was probably
contemplating suicide.

402
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:26,291
His head's right there, Nobuaki.

403
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:27,916
Why don't you ask him for us?

404
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,416
You're a monster!

405
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:33,125
I think dying might be
easier than playing anymore.

406
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:34,291
You're right.

407
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:37,041
No. Hurry, Natsuko,
go stop her.

408
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:41,708
Stop her? I guess.
Just don't get the wrong idea.

409
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:43,208
I'm doing this for me.

410
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:47,083
Sorry, Aimi. My dear.

411
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:49,291
But I need you
to keep on living.

412
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:51,416
You're gonna have
to save me again later.

413
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:55,833
[NOBUAKI]
Is this right? Or wrong?

414
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:58,041
I can't tell
the difference anymore.

Hey, Nobuaki. What's going on?
What's that?

418
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:10,041
Why's Teru on the ground?

419
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:13,833
Look, I bought you a hat!

420
00:21:13,916 --> 00:21:16,958
It took a while, but I finally
found one that's perfect.

Isn't it cool? I hope it fits.
[chuckles]

00:21:21,833 --> 00:21:25,250
Ryou, Teruaki's gone.

424
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:27,416
What's wrong?
Don't you like it?

425
00:21:28,416 --> 00:21:32,666
Hey, Nobuaki.
Why isn't Teru smiling, huh?

426
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:36,291
I spent so much time
picking out a hat,

427
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:38,250
but he doesn't look
happy about it.

428
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:43,625
There.

429
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:46,583
Come on,
why aren't you smiling?

430
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:48,541
Your best friend got you
a great present!

431
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:50,500
Stop it.

432
00:21:50,583 --> 00:21:52,500
Please just put him down.

433
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:54,208
[RYOU]
Smile, Teru.

434
00:21:54,291 --> 00:21:56,291
Let's see those pearly whites!

435
00:21:56,375 --> 00:21:59,291
[NOBUAKI] Little by little,
everyone's starting to break.

436
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:03,708
What's wrong. Come on!
Smile! Please?

437
00:22:04,833 --> 00:22:07,041
[RYOU laughing]

438
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:09,333
[NOBUAKI]
They're losing their humanity.

439
00:22:09,416 --> 00:22:11,416
Soon there'll be nothing left.
