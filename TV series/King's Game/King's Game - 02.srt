Get your hands off of her!

316
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,250
You stay out of this!

317
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:46,416
[grunts, coughs]

318
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,333
I've begged, but you've
offered me no way out.

319
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:51,375
I guess you're telling
the truth then.

320
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:54,333
You honestly don't know how
to escape the King's Game.

321
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:57,125
And here I was hoping you'd have
some sort of good advice

322
00:17:57,208 --> 00:17:59,000
since you've played it
before and survived.

323
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:01,250
Hold on.
You're gonna do it here?

324
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:04,750
Natsuko? What's come over you
all of a sudden?

325
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,791
[NATSUKO]
I swear that I'll survive.

326
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:08,916
And I'll stop
at nothing to do so.

327
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,958
Hurry and strip, Teruaki!

328
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:14,208
What are you, crazy?
You've gotta stop this.

329
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:15,750
You can't just do it
in the open.

330
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:17,250
[NATSUKO scoffs]

331
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:19,625
Why don't you shut up
and die already, hypocrite?

332
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:22,958
Who are you?
It's like you've changed.

333
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:25,500
You think so?

334
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:27,583
I'm the same Natsuko
who sat beside you

335
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:29,291
on your first day of class,

336
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:31,625
who you ran with you
at the sports day,

337
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:34,208
who talked to you about
love and your girlfriend,

338
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:37,333
and of course, the person
who you tried to kill.

339
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:39,250
Remember, Nobu?

340
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:44,583
So, Teruaki,
you don't want to die.

341
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:46,041
We might as well get started.

342
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,041
-Wait a second!
-Ugh.

343
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:50,166
Come with me, Nobuaki.

344
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:57,375
So, what's your plan
for the game?

345
00:18:57,458 --> 00:18:59,375
We need to work
as one to stay safe.

346
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:01,375
Maybe we can avoid
the punishments.

347
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:03,500
[sighs] You still want
to protect them,

348
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:05,541
despite the fact that they beat
the crap out of you.

349
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:06,916
Grow a pair.

350
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,291
People can do or say
whatever they want to me.

351
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:10,916
As long as I save them,
I don't care.

352
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,208
[scoffs]

353
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:15,333
Could you be more annoying?
Face it.

354
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:19,083
Every animal puts its own
survival above everything else.

355
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:20,833
You can't hesitate
or be afraid

356
00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:23,083
to betray your closest friend
to save yourself.

357
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:26,000
You know that.
After all, you survived, right?

358
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:30,208
-Who'd you kill?
-Natsuko. Why are--?

359
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:32,083
If you don't get
out of my sight,

360
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:34,208
I'll murder you myself.

361
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:36,458
I hate you!

362
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:38,333
Let go!

363
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:39,791
[coughs]

364
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:42,125
What the hell's wrong with you?

365
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:44,208
-[laughs]
-Get dressed.

366
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:45,750
[NATSUKO screams]

367
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:49,208
Somebody please come quick!
Nobuaki's attacking me!

368
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:52,000
Hey, no, don't.
What are you saying?

369
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:53,208
[giggles]

370
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:54,958
I'm just teaching you
a lesson.

371
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,625
-Kanazawa!
-Natsuko!

372
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:00,541
How can you even think
about being a perv

373
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:03,375
-when our classmates are dying?
-You guys have it all wrong.

374
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:05,375
I was just trying
to talk to Natsuko.

375
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:07,500
Murazumi, you believe me,
don't you?

376
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:09,166
-[crying]
-You ass.

377
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,833
I've seen the way that you look
at her in the classroom.

378
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:16,625
Teruaki! She's lying!
Tell them she is!

379
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:24,333
[NOBUAKI]
No. No way.

380
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:29,125
-You'll regret ever moving here.
-You don't deserve to live.

381
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:30,250
Loser!

382
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:33,875
How does this feel?

383
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:36,000
Still want to touch her,
you scumbag?

384
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:38,791
It's all your fault.
You did this to us.

385
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:41,041
Mizuki, you know
what you have to do.

386
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:43,750
Send Nobuaki a text
telling him to die.

387
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:48,041
What? What are talking about?
Natsuko?

388
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:50,625
It was in the message
from the king today, remember?

389
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:53,458
If she texts someone the word
"die," then they're done.

390
00:20:53,541 --> 00:20:55,958
Finish him off, Mizuki.
This is your chance.

391
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:57,541
No. I can't do that.

392
00:20:57,625 --> 00:20:59,916
[NOBUAKI]
Natsuko, wait.

393
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,250
Go ahead.

394
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:03,625
All you have to do
is type and press send.

395
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:06,291
But if Nobuaki
really dies after,

396
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:09,500
then won't it mean
that I killed him?

397
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,291
Listen to me, Mizuki.

398
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:15,375
If you don't send that text
to someone, then you will die.

399
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:18,166
Killing Nobuaki is
the natural thing to do.

400
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:20,125
I mean, you hate him,
don't you?

401
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:21,583
He deserves it.

402
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:24,333
[NOBUAKI]
Natsuko, what's with you?

403
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:27,166
Besides, it's not like
there'll be blood on your hands.

404
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:28,458
You're only sending a text.

405
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:30,583
[NOBUAKI]
She's dangerous.

406
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:34,083
Come on, just try it out.
I bet it'll feel really good.

407
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:36,208
He'll be getting
what's coming to him.

408
00:21:36,291 --> 00:21:40,250
Hey, Teru. Is she acting weird?
Or is it just me?

409
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:43,083
Yeah. She's like
a different person.

410
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:49,833
[NOBUAKI] Someone,
even if it's only one of you.

411
00:21:49,916 --> 00:21:52,500
Listen to me, please.

412
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:57,166
I'm begging you, help me.

413
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:06,500
Where are you, Nobuaki?
I'm supposed to meet you.

414
00:22:06,583 --> 00:22:10,291
If you can hear my voice
just say something!

415
00:22:10,375 --> 00:22:12,250
[NOBUAKI]
Akamatsu...

416
00:22:12,333 --> 00:22:13,583
Kenta.
