1
00:00:17,375 --> 00:00:19,333
Just who I wanted to talk to.

2
00:00:19,416 --> 00:00:21,333
You have a lot
of explaining to do.

3
00:00:21,416 --> 00:00:24,875
Oh? Tell me, are you still
with Kenta and Mizuki?

4
00:00:26,125 --> 00:00:28,291
I bet they look so cute.

5
00:00:28,375 --> 00:00:30,916
They're cuddled up next
to each other, aren't they?

6
00:00:33,916 --> 00:00:36,875
-What did you do? Tell me now!
-[NATSUKO] This is a relief.

7
00:00:36,958 --> 00:00:39,083
I was waiting all day
to get a text from her

8
00:00:39,166 --> 00:00:41,000
telling me to die.

9
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:43,625
Let me guess.
Kenta sent it instead.

10
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:48,208
Basically, as soon as that text
came in, I screwed Teruaki.

11
00:00:48,291 --> 00:00:50,166
That way, an "obedience
confirmed" message

12
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,083
got sent out to everyone.

13
00:00:52,166 --> 00:00:53,625
[giggles]

14
00:00:53,708 --> 00:00:55,875
I figured Kenta
would totally misunderstand

15
00:00:55,958 --> 00:00:57,500
and think it was for Mizuki.

16
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:01,166
So, I was right.
That guy was an idiot.

17
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:03,666
I'm surprised
he survived this long.

18
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,833
She was doomed the second
she switched devices,

19
00:01:05,916 --> 00:01:07,666
but he still tried
to save her

20
00:01:08,916 --> 00:01:10,666
How sweet.

21
00:01:11,875 --> 00:01:13,458
It's perfect.

22
00:01:13,541 --> 00:01:16,125
This way Kenta got exactly
what he wanted from the start.

23
00:01:16,208 --> 00:01:18,541
He died with his timid
little girlfriend

24
00:01:18,625 --> 00:01:20,750
-blushing at his side.
-Shut up!

25
00:01:20,833 --> 00:01:22,333
[NATSUKO]
Ooh, are sure that you want

26
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:24,250
to talk to me like that?

27
00:01:24,333 --> 00:01:25,375
Why shouldn't I?

28
00:01:25,458 --> 00:01:26,875
You do remember
it's your phone

29
00:01:26,958 --> 00:01:28,208
I'm calling from, right?

30
00:01:29,833 --> 00:01:32,541
Well, enjoy your night.
See you soon, Nobu.

31
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:34,875
-Buh-bye.
-No, wait! Hello?

32
00:01:36,791 --> 00:01:39,750
Poor little Nobu,
your life is in my hands.

33
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:42,791
And I'm going to make sure
that you die next.

34
00:01:42,875 --> 00:01:45,625
[breathing shakily]

35
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:24,583
Crap.
Natsuko's friggin' crazy.

36
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:26,291
She's out to kill Nobuaki

37
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:28,416
and after that, she'll probably
come for the rest of us.

38
00:03:31,916 --> 00:03:34,583
I've gotta figure out
a way to stop her.

39
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:39,500
Teruaki.

-What are you doing in there?

Answer me.

42
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:45,541
I hope
you're not plotting anything.

43
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:48,166
No way! I'd never do that.

44
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:53,291
[pounding continues]

45
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:57,333
Stop it!
Just leave me alone!

[pounding stops]

My dear Teruaki.

[screams]

49
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,750
You know you can't betray me.

50
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:24,291
Because if you do,
I'll kill you.

51
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:25,666
Understand?

61
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:01,458
Those letters.
Just like Ria said.

62
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:03,041
[RIA]
I think these were likely caused

63
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:05,750
by some kind of bug
in the King's Game program.

64
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:08,083
Maybe they're something
I can exploit.

00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:09,750
[NOBUAKI] "I don't know
what these letters mean

74
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:30,625
Mutation.
So, it was a bug.

75
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:36,958
Ria's theory was correct
in some ways.

76
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:42,708
Kenta got sent one
of these messages, too.

77
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:46,958
Which means I should be
collecting all the symbols.

-[phone ringing]
-Uh...

she'd be calling Kenta.

-Uh, hello?
-[RIONA] Nobuaki? Huh.

So you really were
with the two of them.

-Riona?
-Good, you can read.

00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,833
But don't talk to me
like you know me.

You and I aren't friends.
Can you try to remember that?

Yeah, sure.
What's going on?

86
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,833
Why were you trying
to call Kenta?

87
00:06:11,916 --> 00:06:13,833
[RIONA] Yeah, we should cut
to the chase.

But I'm not gonna share
my intel over the phone.

to come to my house immediately.

Sorry, no can do.

I'm actually
a good ways outside of town.

94
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,583
It'll take me a while
to get back.

95
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:31,833
Maybe around noon?

96
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:34,208
Yeah, fine,
I guess that'll work.

97
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:35,958
But you'd better
come straight here.

But the trains were
a little behind schedule.

I don't wanna hear excuses.

Am I gonna have

Um, I don't think so?

Come on. We're going.

something to tell me.

-At least try to keep up.
-With what?

00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:10,375
I don't want my parents
to see you.

111

What if they thought I was
sneaking you into my room?

112
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:13,791
Now follow me.

113
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:16,583
Yeah. Sure.

114

[BOYS laughing]

115
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:21,875
[NOBUAKI]
This is where we're going?

116
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:23,500
Is that a problem?

117
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:25,625
[NOBUAKI] I guess not.
So, what's on your mind?

118
00:07:25,708 --> 00:07:29,291
The only thing that could be.
The game obviously.

119
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:31,916
You're not the only one who's
been trying to investigate it.

120
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,333
You likely haven't
seen this yet.

121
00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:36,000
But look.
We're not alone.

122
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:42,625
Something similar
to our game happened

123
00:07:42,708 --> 00:07:44,916
at another school
not too long ago.

124
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,250
I found several articles
about it.

125
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:51,416
That's not all.

126
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,500
There's a familiar name
in these reports.

127
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:55,708
Her. Our "darling" Natsuko.

128
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:57,125
So, it's true.

129
00:07:57,208 --> 00:07:59,791
[RIONA] She was hiding
all of this from us.

130
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:03,083
She knew about the King's Game.
I think she survived it.

131
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:04,166
Yeah.

132
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:08,958
[RIONA] You don't seem
surprised by any of this.

133
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:10,916
Okay. What about her?

134
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,416
Iwamura Ria.

135
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,666
Uh!

136
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,541
Wait, how do you know that name?

137
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:18,458
Oh. So then, you do know her.

138
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:21,750
How? Answer me now.

139
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,583
Get your filthy hands off me.

140
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:26,708
Sorry.

141
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:31,916
But... how do you know
about Ria?

142
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,208
She wasn't difficult to find.

143
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:36,916
I assure you that my research
was very thorough.

144
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,541
Eventually,
it led me to your old school

145
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:41,625
where you'd played before.

146
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:44,250
That's when I found something.
Read this.

147
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:49,250
Start talking, Nobuaki.

148
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:52,541
Who is Ria?
What do these words mean?

149
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:54,958
How is this all connected
to the King's Game?

150
00:08:57,916 --> 00:09:00,208
Ria was one of my classmates.

151
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:01,541
She was consumed by flames

152
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:03,791
after breaking one
of the King's rules.

153
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:06,208
And, as far as those
words and stuff go,

154
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:08,583
she was collecting
the one-syllable texts

155
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:10,583
that everyone who died
in the game receives.

156
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:12,708
Look.
There's more here.

157
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:14,750
According to what
I've been reading,

158
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:16,750
there was a King's Game
before the ones Natsuko

159
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:18,458
and I were part of.

160
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:21,583
This notebook was left behind
by a person who played it.

161
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:24,041
It also mentions
the short messages.

162
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:25,250
It's so strange.

163
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:27,625
But this can't just be
a coincidence.

164
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:30,666
They could be the key
that frees us.

165
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:35,250
Interesting.
I was thinking the same thing.

166
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:37,208
Here are the ones
that I collected.

167
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:40,833
I saw Natsuko messing around
with Yuuichi's phone

168
00:09:40,916 --> 00:09:42,875
at the park
right after he died.

169
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:44,791
I thought she might
have found a clue,

170
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,875
so I checked it out later.

171
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:49,166
-Good thinking!
-Yeah. I know.

172
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:54,583
Anyway, I noticed something else
once I started digging further.

173
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:56,375
What am I supposed
to be seeing here?

174
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:03,250
Wait. Are you saying
these syllables are the same?

175
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:06,666
-I think they are.
-Okay, that's good.

176
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:07,833
Between the ones I have now

177
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:09,625
and the ones
I collected last time...

178
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:11,250
We might end up
solving this.

179
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:12,208
Yeah.

180
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:15,125
We might!

181
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:17,250
Thank goodness.

182
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:21,625
Hey. Whoa.
Nobuaki, are you okay?

183
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:24,625
[NOBUAKI] All that death
wasn't for nothing.

184
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:28,541
My friends. Everyone.

185
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:31,333
Their lives mattered in the end.

186
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:32,541
I'll stop him.

187
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:36,791
[crying]
Thank you.

188
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:39,375
You've given me
a little bit of hope again.

189
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:42,958
[NATSUKO]
My, my, my.

190
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:45,666
You look like you're having
a good time, Nobu.

191
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,625
[NOBUAKI]
Natsuko!

192
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:50,291
What were you two
talking about, huh?

193
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:52,291
[RIONA] Why are you
all the way out here?

194
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:54,916
I came to track down
the two of you.

195
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,375
Everyone else is waiting
at Shibafu Field.

196
00:10:57,458 --> 00:10:58,791
[NOBUAKI]
Before we go anywhere...

197
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:02,625
I need answers.

198
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:03,875
About what?

199
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:05,625
Can we talk in private?

200
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:06,666
Fine.

201
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:09,958
Private enough for you?

202
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:12,833
Should I be worried
you'll take advantage of me?

203
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:13,916
Natsuko.

204
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:18,250
You had to play the King's Game
before just like me, didn't you?

205
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:21,208
What does that matter?

206
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:22,500
Did you get an order
saying you had

207
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:24,125
to murder someone yourself?

208
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:25,333
Did you have to kill?

209
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:26,791
Of course I did.

210
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,208
And I didn't hesitate.

211
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:33,083
And was there
someone special to you?

212
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:34,916
One of the other players,
I mean.

213
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:37,166
There was.

214
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,458
Is that who you killed?

215
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:45,458
Bingo. I killed them.

216
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:48,291
It's the only reason
I'm still alive.

217
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:50,791
Damn it.
Why're you bringing this up?

218
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:53,125
None of it has anything
to do with you.

219
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:54,416
I think it does.

220
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:58,291
Natsuko...

221
00:11:58,375 --> 00:12:00,666
when you were little,
did you have a sister?

222
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:03,208
One who you were separated from.

223
00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:05,208
A girl named Honda Chiemi?

224
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:10,000
-[NATSUKO] How do you?
-She's my special person.

225
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:16,708
Oh, really?
Is that how it is?

226
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:20,250
Natsuko. Listen. I think we--

227
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:21,666
Idiot.

228
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,750
[chuckles]
Let me guess.

229
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:26,291
You thought we could come
to some sort of understanding

230
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:28,875
just because I'm related
to your dead girlfriend.

231
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:32,166
You are such
an unbelievably naive child.

232
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:35,083
But that's what I dig
about you, Nobu, babe.

233
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:37,458
Love ya.

234
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:38,875
[NOBUAKI]
What's wrong with you.

235
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:41,125
If that's all, then let's go.

236
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:42,916
We'll be late.

237
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,875
Wait a sec.
Why're you getting us together?

238
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:47,750
What terrible thing
are you planning?

239
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:49,416
[NATSUKO]
Oh, didn't I tell you?

240
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,916
I'm going to carry out
the next order.

241
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,750
It's been fun.
But you're dead next.

242
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:12,166
[RYOU] Teruaki.
Do you really mean that?

243
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,416
I do. Help me.

244
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:18,208
[leaves rustling]

245
00:13:18,291 --> 00:13:20,750
[NATSUKO] Sorry for keeping
everyone waiting.

246
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:30,041
Teruaki. It's good to see you.

247
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:31,416
I'm so glad you're safe.

248
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,375
-Nobuaki, listen to me.
-Sure, what's up?

249
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:37,666
No. Don't worry about it.

250
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,083
Good. It looks like
we're all here.

251
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:41,916
Shall we begin the next game?

252
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,166
There's no point in waiting.

253
00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:50,625
[TERUAKI] Okay. Everyone's seen
the new order, right?

254
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:52,375
[NOBUAKI]
Oh, no. I'm still in the dark.

255
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:53,666
Of course you are.

256
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:57,625
Here.

257
00:13:57,708 --> 00:13:58,958
Give me a sec.

258
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:01,041
So, we're supposed
to do this one at a time

259
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:02,875
in the order
of our seat numbers.

260
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:04,166
Each player can cut off

261
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:06,500
any number of fingers
during their turn.

262
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:08,750
Or just breaking them
will work, too.

263
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:10,583
Each destroyed finger
has a point value

264
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:12,958
that must be assigned
to someone in the class.

265
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:18,000
Fingers on the right hand
are worth one positive point.

266
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:20,625
Fingers on the left hand,
one negative point.

267
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:25,041
We can spread the points across
multiple people if we want to.

268
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:28,250
Whoever ends the game
with a negative score

269
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:30,083
will be punished.

270
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:31,208
Oh, man.

271
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:32,708
So basically,

272
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:34,708
if someone breaks the fingers
on their left hand,

273
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,583
they can give you
negative points.

274
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:39,416
But then you could just mangle
the fingers on your right hand

275
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,833
to get yourself out of danger.

276
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:42,833
This can't be happening.

277
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:45,583
I'm cringing just thinking about
how much it's gonna hurt.

278
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:47,916
There's no reason for you
to freak everyone out like that.

279
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,291
What do you mean?

280
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:51,875
The King says you can
give points to yourself.

281
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:54,833
But he also says you can pass
when it's your turn, no problem.

282
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:56,416
Ugh!

283
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:59,625
[NOBUAKI] Including me,
there are eleven survivors here.

284
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:02,250
This is how they'd be arranged
by their seat numbers.

285
00:15:03,791 --> 00:15:06,875
The problem is that the last
person to go will be Aimi,

286
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:08,625
Natsuko's best friend.

287
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:11,375
If she breaks even one finger
and assigns it to someone else,

288
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:12,708
they're dead.

289
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:14,791
They'd have no chance
to save themselves.

290
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:17,875
Natsuko, can I say
something before we start?

291
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,541
-Have an idea?
-What is it?

292
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:21,333
I have something of a proposal.

293
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:24,208
Isn't it time for us
to stop fighting?

294
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:28,708
-So I'm the bad guy now?
-No!

295
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:31,333
But we should be thinking of
a way for all of us to survive

296
00:15:31,416 --> 00:15:33,916
instead of trying to get this
over with as fast as we can.

297
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,958
-Go to hell.
-What's your problem?

298
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:39,875
The best thing for you to do
right now is follow my orders.

299
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:41,625
So you're just as bad
as the King.

300
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:43,291
That's enough out of you.

301
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:45,958
Do you understand what will
happen if you disobey me?

302
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:51,500
-Is that your phone?
-Yeah. Afraid so.

303
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:54,416
-She stole it from me earlier.
-Of course.

304
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,375
I'm done talking.

305
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:58,166
-Let's get started.
-It'll be okay.

306
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:00,083
-You sure?
-Oh, yeah.

307
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:02,000
A bunch of us agree
with Teruaki.

308
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,208
We never forgot
what you said to us before.

309
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:07,375
At the park.
When this was first starting.

310
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:09,666
If you guys don't want to die,

311
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:12,375
if you don't wanna see
your friends murdered,

312
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:14,500
we have to work together.

313
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:16,041
I was so confused,

314
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:18,250
but I think I understand now.

315
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:19,875
We should be looking
for a way to save

316
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:22,000
our remaining classmates
from getting hurt.

317
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:23,458
Ryou.

318
00:16:23,541 --> 00:16:25,291
[NOBUAKI]
Wait. This is simple.

319
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:27,416
For this order,
as long as everyone passes,

320
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,666
no one will be punished.

321
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,333
But is that really plausible?

322
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:32,500
Do we have that much faith
in each other?

323
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:34,291
[MASATOSHI]
I'm first. I pass.

324
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,250
You're next, Kanazawa.
What you gonna do?

325
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:41,625
Wait, not so fast.
What's your deal?

326
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:44,375
Are you really sure that
passing's the smartest idea?

327
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:46,166
I made my choice.
And they're right.

328
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:49,250
This is no time for us
to be fighting with each other.

329
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:52,041
Damn it.

330
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:53,791
If even one person breaks
a finger on their left hand,

331
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:55,208
this falls apart.

332
00:16:55,291 --> 00:16:56,250
[RYOU]
Hey, Nobu.

333
00:16:57,291 --> 00:16:59,916
Please pass.
It'll be best for all of us.

334
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,041
Yeah. But what if...

335
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:02,875
You have to put
your trust in us.

336
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:05,250
Does that mean...

337
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:12,541
I'm also passing.

338
00:17:14,791 --> 00:17:16,083
You're too soft.

339
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:17,125
You won't win this.

340
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:19,958
Thank you. Nobuaki.

341
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:23,291
Watch to the end,
no matter what happens, okay.

342
00:17:24,416 --> 00:17:25,875
Things could get intense.

343
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:28,583
Okay.

344
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:34,541
I'm gonna pass as well.

345
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:36,666
Yeah, same here.

346
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,416
There's no reason
any innocent people

347
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,791
need to get hurt playing this.

348
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:42,041
[NATSUKO]
What in the hell's going on?

349
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:45,375
This can't all be because
of Teruaki's little outburst.

350
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:56,416
[NOBUAKI]
It's so peaceful today,

351
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:59,291
even though we're playing
this monstrous game.

352
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:01,958
I thought this was going to end
up being a brutal struggle,

353
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:04,041
but it's almost nice.

354
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:06,666
Yeah, I'm gonna pass, too.

355
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:10,583
[NOBUAKI]
Only six people left to go.

356
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:14,333
Teruaki Riona, Natsuko

357
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:18,583
and then Aya, Rina, and Aimi.

358
00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:20,416
That means I'm the next one up.

359
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:29,666
Nobuaki, can I borrow you
for a second first?

360
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,500
Uh, yeah, sure.

361
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:33,000
[NATSUKO]
Are you kidding me?

362
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:34,458
This won't take long.

363
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,625
So, what's this haircut
all about?

364
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:44,333
You've let yourself
get pretty shaggy.

365
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:49,166
No way you'll get a girlfriend
with all this hiding your face.

366
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:51,666
-Probably not.
-Hurry it up.

367
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,750
We're in the middle
of a game, remember?

368
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:55,750
I know. That's why I'm here.

369
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:57,791
When everything looks like
it's going to hell,

370
00:18:57,875 --> 00:18:59,916
you should do
what you can to help out.

371
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,958
Don't you think?

372
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:04,625
[scoffs]
Just get it over with fast.

373
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:06,708
That girl is just the worst.

374
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:08,416
What's really going on?

375
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,583
I feel like there's something
in front of me that I'm missing.

376
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:12,708
You'll find out.

377
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:17,958
Do you think
he's really going to be able

378
00:19:18,041 --> 00:19:19,291
to go through with this plan?

379
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:21,416
I don't know.
But, honestly, I really hope

380
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,083
he ends up
chickening out before he can.

381
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:25,416
[NOBUAKI]
You're pretty good at this.

382
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,625
[chuckles]
Thanks a lot.

383
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:30,000
I want to be
a hair stylist one day

384
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:31,333
That's awesome.

385
00:19:31,416 --> 00:19:32,958
I forgot you offered
to cut my hair for me

386
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:34,083
when I moved here.

387
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:35,500
It's good practice.

388
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:37,625
I guess you could
call this my dream.

389
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:39,000
After I graduate high school,

390
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:41,125
my plan is to go
to a cosmetology program.

391
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,416
Just you wait. I'm going to be
a celebrity hairdresser.

392
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,166
Wow, you sure are confident.

393
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:50,333
[chuckles]
My 45,000 yen shears help too.

394
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:53,916
-Holy crap.
-[laughing]

395
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,291
And these aren't
even top of the line.

396
00:19:57,583 --> 00:20:00,041
I guess I don't really know that
much about the world of hair.

397
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:02,708
Here we go.

398
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:05,708
[NATSUKO] All right, wrap it up,
would ya? I'm bored.

399
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:08,041
This joke has dragged
on long enough.

400
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,833
You almost done?

401
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:13,041
Don't worry,
it'll all be over real soon.

402
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:15,541
Just gotta trust me.

403
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:20,291
[NOBUAKI] I didn't know Teruaki
had such a big heart.

404
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:22,583
I really hope his dreams
come true one day.

405
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:27,625
I want him to live.
I want him to have a future.

406
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:30,291
There. All done.

407
00:20:31,791 --> 00:20:33,958
-Thanks, man.
-You like it?

408
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:38,291
-It's much better.
-I'm so glad.

409
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:40,083
One last cut while I can.

410
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,000
[screams]

411
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:52,250
No, what are you doing?

412
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:56,666
Wait! What's going on?
Why didn't he pass?

413
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:59,000
Teruaki! No more!

414
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:04,250
Do you really like
your hair?

415
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:08,541
Be honest with me.
What do you think?

416
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:09,666
[grunts]

417
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:12,458
It's great. S-Seriously.

418
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:14,583
The best cut I've ever had!

419
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:16,083
Thank you so much.

420
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:19,416
So you can stop.
Got it?

421
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,916
If you keep going, you won't
ever hold scissors again!

422
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,041
[TERUAKI]
Keep your cool, Nobuaki.

423
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:28,166
Broken bones will heal
over the course of time.

424
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:30,208
I'm just playing up
the pain for our audience.

425
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:33,416
What? Tell me your plan!

426
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,416
I'm getting our phones back
from Natsuko

427
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,541
before she breaks them.

428
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,458
And I got everyone else
in on it, too.

429
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:41,666
Then that means

430
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:43,666
you're the reason
everyone else has passed.

431
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:47,416
I'm not gonna
let her murder us.

432
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,458
No way!

433
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:50,500
But what are you
gonna do next?

434
00:21:50,583 --> 00:21:52,708
I'm going to teach her a lesson.

435
00:21:52,791 --> 00:21:54,916
I won't take any more threats.

436
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,458
I'm gonna prove to her that
we're stronger together.

437
00:21:57,541 --> 00:21:58,875
To do that...

438
00:22:00,541 --> 00:22:02,500
I need to have lots
of negative points.

439
00:22:02,583 --> 00:22:03,750
No! Stop!

440
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:08,750
I'll give my entire
left hand to the King.

441
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:11,833
Natsuko! What are
you gonna do now?

442
00:22:11,916 --> 00:22:14,875
Teruaki!
