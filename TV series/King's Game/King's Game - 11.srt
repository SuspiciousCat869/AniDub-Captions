00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:34,916
You have to kill me now!
I know you don't want to,

158
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,208
but it's the only way
for you to survive the game.

-Are you crazy? I can't do that!
-Maybe you're forgetting.

160
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:43,958
You made me a promise that
you wouldn't die before I did.

161
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:45,958
No, that's not fair.

162
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:48,500
Both of us are going to survive,
do you hear me?

163
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:50,541
Of course I wanna live,

164
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:52,583
but I only want to see
tomorrow if you're there.

165
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:57,541
I want the same thing, Nobuaki.

-Put that down now!

And then, one final message
came in from the king.

Yeah, so what did it say?

can't believe you fell for that.

What? Natsuko! Did you do this?

199
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:43,458
Yep. I was kind of worried that
I set this trap for nothing,

200
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:44,750
so I flipped the sign

201
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:46,625
to make sure someone
would come this way.

202

I should probably thank you
for being my first catch.

I'm afraid that you won't reach

if you go that way.

Take this path over here.

It's a little tough,
but much faster.

You go on ahead, I'll find

I've begged,

but you've offered me
no way out.

I guess you're telling
the truth then.

You think so?

And of course, the person
who you tried to kill.

of getting to the summit

Look. She said it goes
all the way up to the summit.

Then why the hell
aren't you on that trail?

Because it's Natsuko.

She's totally trying to kill
as many of us as possible.

Maybe. But she probably already
made it up to the finish line.

by this bastard.

Well, I hate to break it to you,

can survive this game,

wanted to be punished?

No!

Why did you let go?
Why'd you run away?

You... you basically
murdered me, Rina!

No! Stop it!
I'm sorry!

I didn't have a choice.

Forgive me. Please, stop.

00:21:06,916 --> 00:21:09,000
I murdered every one
of my classmates.

315
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:11,041
But you don't have the backbone.

Hold on. Where was that scream
coming from?

This is it!
We're almost out of time!

till the only one left is me.

Get outta the way!
You won't stop us, Natsuko!
