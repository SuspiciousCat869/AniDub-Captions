1
00:00:13,125 --> 00:00:14,791
Ria?

2
00:00:14,875 --> 00:00:17,833
Nami didn't get death
assigned as her punishment.

3
00:00:21,625 --> 00:00:24,333
She killed herself
of her own free will.

4
00:00:24,416 --> 00:00:25,416
Uh!

5
00:00:27,083 --> 00:00:29,333
Is that what you
came here to say?

6
00:00:29,416 --> 00:00:30,958
Oh, scary.

7
00:00:31,041 --> 00:00:32,500
You could use some
of that anger,

8
00:00:32,583 --> 00:00:34,458
to try and murder me.

9
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:37,458
[RIA]
Do you think you could do it?

10
00:00:37,541 --> 00:00:38,750
Remember,

11
00:00:38,833 --> 00:00:40,875
I did tell you
that I'm the King.

12
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:43,458
If you kill me,
this whole game is over.

13
00:02:14,041 --> 00:02:16,000
[NOBUAKI]
You shut up.

14
00:02:16,083 --> 00:02:17,625
We know The King
isn't in our class

15
00:02:17,708 --> 00:02:20,250
because Nami sacrificed herself
to figure that out.

16
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:21,458
Are you sure about that?

17
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:23,000
You were there,
so you saw

18
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:24,458
that she didn't touch me.

19
00:02:24,541 --> 00:02:26,875
I grabbed her hand
and was in control.

20
00:02:26,958 --> 00:02:28,541
So that means
technically speaking,

21
00:02:28,625 --> 00:02:29,958
she didn't grab me herself.

22
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:32,291
No. You're trying to confuse me.

23
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:35,166
Wasn't it you who said you were
sure the King was in our class?

24
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,000
Were you really that wrong?

25
00:02:37,083 --> 00:02:39,250
[NOBUAKI] If she really is
the King, then...

26
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:41,333
I could end her right now.

27
00:02:41,416 --> 00:02:43,208
And the game
would finally be over.

28
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:46,416
Ria!

29
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:49,875
[panting]

30
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:52,791
If I find out that
you're really behind this game,

31
00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:54,458
I swear that
I'll kill you myself.

32
00:02:55,791 --> 00:02:57,083
God, you're a joke.

33
00:02:57,166 --> 00:02:58,958
This is getting so boring.

34
00:03:04,791 --> 00:03:07,291
See? If I were the King,
then you'd be dead right now.

35
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:08,958
You can never
let your guard down.

36
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:10,750
You've gotta be more
committed than that.

37
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:12,125
Do you actually think
you can beat him

38
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:13,583
with such a weak attitude?

39
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:18,375
Yeah, okay, I get it.
You're not The King

40
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:20,291
so what the hell
are you trying to do right now?

41
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:21,750
I guess if we're being honest,

42
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:23,750
I just want to have fun
playing the game.

43
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:26,291
And a game's only enjoyable
if you win, don't you think?

44
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:28,083
How could you say
something like that?

45
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:29,750
This monster wants
to murder all of us.

46
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:32,125
Which means I'll do
whatever it takes

47
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:35,166
to make sure I'm the winner.
I'll even kill you.

48
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:36,875
As long as I live.

49
00:03:36,958 --> 00:03:38,375
What the hell?

50
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:40,458
Have you gone totally insane
or something?

51
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:42,083
There must be another way.

52
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:43,500
Somehow we can
get out of this game

53
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:46,541
without any other
classmates dying.

54
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:48,666
Maybe. I guess
there's no real harm

55
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,583
in trying to play the game
your way.

56
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:52,000
For now.

57
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:53,541
I still think you're going
to lose to the King

58
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:55,250
and end up dead, though.

59
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:59,375
But that doesn't matter, since
either way I'll come out on top.

60
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:12,041
Yousuke.

61
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:13,958
Yeah? What is it?

62
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:16,916
I'm just thinking about how long
this game has been going on.

63
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,041
Mm.

64
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:19,458
[KAORI]
If it doesn't stop,

65
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:21,041
am I going to die, too?

66
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:22,666
Kaori.

67
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:28,000
It's gonna be okay.
I'll end it.

68
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:30,375
I've been doing some research
into the game's history.

69
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:32,833
Along with all the deaths
that have occurred.

70
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:35,541
I'll find a way
to stop this curse.

71
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:38,666
Kaori.
You are not gonna to die.

72
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:39,791
I promise you.

73
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:41,583
Thanks for saying that.

74
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:47,208
Hey, there's no need to cry.
You just have to trust me, okay?

75
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:49,916
-You know what?
-Uh.

76
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,291
This kinda reminds me
of when we were kids.

77
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,625
Like when we were
in elementary school.

78
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:57,833
The older boys would pick on me,
but you had my back.

79
00:04:57,916 --> 00:04:59,208
You stood up for me,

80
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:01,500
-and made sure I was safe.
-Hm.

81
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:03,708
I guess you've always
been there for me,

82
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:05,333
-my whole life.
-Really?

83
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:07,250
You should give me
your phone number.

84
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:09,375
So we can check on each other
through all this.

85
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:12,250
Yeah, okay. Sounds good.

86
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:15,416
It's weird to admit,

87
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,333
but I probably
would have been too shy

88
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:19,041
to ask for your number
before the game.

89
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:22,208
Heh, I get that.

90
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:24,333
Thank you.
I feel better,

91
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:27,458
like things'll end up
all right. See ya.

92
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:29,166
Please be careful.

93
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:37,375
Our classmates just keep dying.
Three more last night.

94
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:39,291
Shingo and Motoki
got into a fight,

95
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:41,708
and Shingo ended up
falling down some stairs.

96
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:43,958
Motoki died from some
kind of weird seizure

97
00:05:44,041 --> 00:05:46,458
and it sounds like Maki died
from the same thing.

98
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:48,791
Akemi apparently
picked Motoki and Maki

99
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:50,625
to send her texts out to.

100
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:54,541
[NAOYA]
Are you listening?

101
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:55,916
You look spaced.

102
00:05:57,666 --> 00:05:58,666
[NAOYA]
Who's is this?

103
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,375
[NOBUAKI]
It's Nami's.

104
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:04,250
She's dead.
Everyone keeps dying.

105
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:06,416
Sometimes right in front
of their friends.

106
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:09,958
I don't think that I can
take it much longer.

107
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:11,166
Nobuaki.

108
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:12,416
-[phone ringing]
-Uh.

109
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,291
-Hello?
-[YOUSUKE] Nobuaki.

110
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:17,583
It's me.

111
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:19,708
-Yousuke?
-Listen to this.

112
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:22,791
I'm researching the King's Game
and I think I found something.

113
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:24,958
It could be a clue
as to how this is happening.

114
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:27,166
-Seriously?
-Here's the thing:

115
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:28,708
everyone who's dead
because of the game

116
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:31,000
got a text from the King
right before they died.

117
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:33,416
-He messaged the victims?
-Yeah.

118
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,791
It was just a single syllable
for each, though.

119
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:37,916
Okay, so what does that mean?

120
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,833
[YOUSUKE]
Honestly, I'm not sure yet.

121
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:42,041
But it could lead us
to something else.

122
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:43,416
A way to stop this.

123
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,833
Hey man, look here.

124
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:50,250
Wait a sec.
Nami got one, too.

125
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:52,208
It just says "R-E",
but it's from the King.

126
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:53,750
That's a big help, thanks.

127
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:56,166
We all need to work together
to end this thing.

128
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,750
If we do, we can save
as many people as possible.

129
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:00,916
You're right.
Kinda gives me hope.

130
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,291
But there is something else,

131
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:03,875
something that feels
really wrong to me.

132
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:04,916
[YOUSUKE]
What is it?

133
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:09,375
The way Ria's acting.
She called herself the King.

134
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:12,291
And she seems to know more
about the game than anyone else.

135
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:13,875
Plus,
it's practically impossible

136
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:15,291
to tell what she's thinking.

137
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:16,625
Ria, huh?

138
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:18,666
Do we even know
who she really is?

139
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,125
[YOUSUKE]
Well, I've heard some rumors.

140
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:22,916
Apparently she hasn't
always been so closed off.

141
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,708
She used to smile all the time,
and was actually friendly.

142
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:26,791
A totally different girl.

143
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:28,666
-Yeah?
-Uh huh.

144
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:31,250
[YOUSUKE]
But then her biological father,

145
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:33,583
he started abusing her,
sexually.

146
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:35,625
And after that,
she just kind of shut down

147
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:38,083
and stopped showing emotions
or opening up to anyone.

148
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,041
That's terrible.

149
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:42,458
I think she's been
acting strange, too, though.

150
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:43,958
If I find anything out,
I'll tell you.

151
00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:45,333
Thanks.

152
00:07:45,416 --> 00:07:47,583
[YOUSUKE] Also, can I ask you
to do something?

153
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:49,625
[NOBUAKI]
Sure, whatever you need.

154
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:51,791
[YOUSUKE]
It's about Kaori.

155
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:55,500
If I end up
not making it through this...

156
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:56,875
will you take care of her?

157
00:07:56,958 --> 00:07:57,958
For me?

158
00:07:58,041 --> 00:08:00,125
Course I will. Promise.

159
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:01,916
Don't worry.

160
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,958

This can't be happening.

197
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:41,833
How could he be alive
one minute and dead the next?

198
00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:45,375
I have no idea what I'm supposed
to even do right now.

00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:47,375
Hey.
What'd he say?

200
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:49,125
Did he tell you
how he broke the rules?

201
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:51,666
Is it because he blocked
the messages from the King?

202
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,375
How did you know he did that?

203
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:57,125
Oh, well, yesterday I overheard
him, Takayuki and Yuusuke.

204
00:09:57,208 --> 00:09:58,875
They were wondering
what would happen

205
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:00,083
if they blocked the King
and didn't get

206
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:01,708
any more of the texts.

207
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:03,041
Those idiots!

208
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:04,833
Like it could possibly
be that easy

209
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:06,166
to escape this nightmare.

210
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:07,791
Didn't they read--

211
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:09,416
I think I figured it out.

212
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:12,041
Huh? From the very first texts.
One of the rules was that

213
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:14,333
you can't drop out of
the game partway through.

214
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:17,500
Since Shouta, Takayuki,
and Akemi blocked the texts,

215
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:20,833
they all broke the rules.
That's why they were punished.

216
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:22,625
I don't think that's
the case with Akemi.

217
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:24,083
I just called her
and got a message

218
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:26,291
saying that her number
wasn't in service anymore.

219
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:28,791
I bet she must have canceled
her entire contract.

220
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:31,291
So even if you don't have
a phone, the King can kill.

In this case
that's a death sentence.

At this rate, none of us
are going to survive.

317
00:14:57,416 --> 00:14:59,166
I'm sorry, Yousuke.

318
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:01,750
I just don't think
I'm gonna be able to do that.

319
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:05,583
But I have faith in you.
You can work with Naoya.

320
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:07,208
The two of you can
take down the King.

321
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:08,833
[YOUSUKE]
That's not gonna happen.

322
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:10,875
It's over for me.

323
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:13,541
This is the last time
you'll hear my voice.

324
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:18,041
Yousuke? Don't tell me that...

325
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:19,541
you cried?

326
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:20,958
[YOUSUKE]
I see now.

327
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:22,500
So that's what the order meant.

328
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:23,833
The whole "unnecessary" part.

329
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:25,625
That's clever.

330
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:27,916
How could anyone
not cry in this game?

331
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:30,333
No. Yousuke.

332
00:15:30,416 --> 00:15:32,833
If I end up not
making it through this,

333
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:35,458
will you take care of her?
For me?

334
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:38,416
You've got to call Kaori now
before it's too late!

335
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,625
It could be your last chance

336
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:41,250
to tell her how
you feel about her.

337
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:44,583
Right now, I only care about you
getting to Yonaki Village.

338
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:46,541
You have to stop this game.

339
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:49,416
I can die happy as long
as I know you'll save everyone.

340
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,041
[NOBUAKI] No, maybe I was wrong,
maybe you won't die.

341
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:53,625
[YOUSUKE]
It's fine.

342
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:56,083
Just don't let anyone
make Kaori cry.

343
00:15:56,166 --> 00:15:57,583
Keep her safe.

344
00:15:57,666 --> 00:16:01,083
I promise.
I'll take care of her.

345
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:04,083
Thanks, and goodbye.

346
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:11,500
Okay. This info should be
all he needs to get there.

347
00:16:16,416 --> 00:16:17,708
[screams]

348
00:16:23,541 --> 00:16:27,291
Not yet.
You won't stop me.

349
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:29,833
There's no way
I'm gonna die...

350
00:16:29,916 --> 00:16:33,041
before I get this
research to him.

351
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:39,416
Finish this for me, please.

352
00:16:46,416 --> 00:16:48,291
[panting]

353
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:50,875
-Now the end.
-[phone ringing]

354
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:53,416
Kaori?

355
00:16:56,875 --> 00:17:00,583
I want to hear her voice
one more time.

356
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:09,666
[screams]

357
00:17:15,666 --> 00:17:16,750
Kaori.

358
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:21,583
[screams]

359
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:29,083
[phone continues ringing]

360
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:38,833
You can't cry.

361
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:41,000
No matter what,
not a single tear.

362
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:43,916
Yousuke knew he was gonna die,
but he held it together.

363
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,458
I can, too.
He trusted me to end this.

364
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:49,750
He did all the research for us.

365
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:52,125
I won't let his death
be for nothing.

366
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:55,083
He was right,
it's too soon to lose hope.

367
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:56,666
It hurts like hell right now,

368
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,625
but I'm gonna fight this
King, dammit.

369
00:17:58,708 --> 00:18:03,416
That's right.
I'm coming for you, bastard.

370
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,875
[phone ringing]

371
00:18:05,958 --> 00:18:09,166
-Hello?
-It's Nobuaki.

372
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:10,500
Oh.

373
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:12,958
What's up?

374
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:15,041
[NOBUAKI]
It's about the King's Game.

375
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:16,208
Oh, yeah,
Naoya called

376
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:17,583
and told me not to
block the King

377
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:19,791
or cancel my service
or anything like that.

378
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:21,541
[NOBUAKI]
Yeah. Good.

379
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:23,125
There's one more thing
to add, though.

380
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:24,583
Mm-hmm?

381
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:26,833
[NOBUAKI] Whatever happens
today, you can't cry.

382
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:29,041
-Like, at all.
-Don't cry?

383
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:31,125
That's what
the order meant earlier.

384
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:33,000
So you shouldn't look
at your texts,

385
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:35,583
or talk to anybody
on the phone for that matter.

386
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:38,291
[KAORI]
All right. Got it. I won't.

387
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:40,583
Promise me, will you?

388
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:43,833
Okay. Listen,
did you tell Yousuke?

389
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:45,416
I've been calling him,

390
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,500
but he's not answering
his phone and I'm kinda worried

391
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:49,458
'cause I don't think
he'd ignore me.

392
00:18:49,541 --> 00:18:51,291
[NOBUAKI]
It's okay. He's fine.

393
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:52,375
Oh, really?

394
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:53,833
I just talked to him,

395
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:55,333
as a matter of fact.

396
00:18:55,416 --> 00:18:57,583
He said we could
expose the King,

397
00:18:57,666 --> 00:19:00,291
we just have to go
to Yonaki village.

398
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:02,791
I'm heading there now,
as fast as I can.

399
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:05,416
You're what? You're not doing
anything crazy, right?

400
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,916
-Remember, you can't cry, okay?
-[line clicks]

401
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,541
Hmm.

402
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:14,708
I said I was going
to Yonaki Village,

403
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:16,375
and yet, here I am.

404
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:18,208
[sighs]

405
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:22,208
Huh?

406
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:29,208
Oh! Ow!

407
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:33,500
Someone hit me.
Where am I?

408
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:35,541
Wait, was it the King?

409
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:38,583
Is he here?
Am I gonna be killed?

410
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:42,541
Help! Someone!
Please, help me!

411
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:44,041
Anyone?

412
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:45,583
-[footsteps approaching]
-Oh.

413
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:48,666
I bet everyone cried for help
just like you are now.

414
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,541
Shouting that
they didn't want to die.

415
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:53,416
But you still killed them.
You're a murderer!

416
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,166
And now my Yousuke is dead!

417
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:58,208
You told me he was fine,
that I didn't need to worry.

418
00:19:58,291 --> 00:20:00,000
I liked him
for the longest time,

419
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:02,333
but I never got a chance
to tell him how I feel.

420
00:20:02,416 --> 00:20:04,708
We were gonna survive
this together.

421
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:06,250
And after,
I was gonna ask him

422
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:07,833
if he felt the same way

423
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:09,250
and wanted to go out with me.

424
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,250
But you lied to me,
and now he's dead.

425
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:12,541
Tell the truth!

426
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:14,208
You're the one behind this,
aren't you?

427
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:15,625
You're wrong!

428
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:17,583
I promised Yousuke
that I'd end the King's Game

429
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:19,208
before anyone else got hurt.

430
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:21,666
-Liar!
-I'm telling the truth!

431
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:23,166
We talked right before he died.

432
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:25,500
He sent me the info
he'd gathered on the King.

433
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:26,916
He trusted me,

434
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
so I have to follow through
and go there, now.

435
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:33,250
Yousuke...
gave everything for us.

436
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:34,875
I'm sure he wanted
to talk to you.

437
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:36,000
This damn game.

438
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:37,458
If it's taught us
anything at all,

439
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:38,791
it's that life isn't fair!

440
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:42,500
Listen to me.

441
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:44,791
Yousuke felt the exact
same way about you!

442
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:46,916
That's why he asked me
to look after you

443
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,583
if anything were
to happen to him.

444
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:50,375
He wanted me to make sure
that no matter what,

445
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:51,833
you didn't have to cry.

446
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:56,916
[crying]

447
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:02,375
I'm not gonna let you get away
with making Kaori cry!

448
00:21:02,458 --> 00:21:03,875
What are you doing?

449
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,958
Oh, no. Yousuke.

450
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:17,041
I won't let his hard work
and sacrifice go to waste.

451
00:21:17,125 --> 00:21:18,666
I promise you.

452
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:25,166
[footsteps approaching]

453
00:21:29,041 --> 00:21:31,083
Wait, so you're
just gonna let me go?

454
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:32,416
[phone chimes]

455
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,000
Is that a new text
from the King?

456
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:37,833
Kaori, you gotta show me
my phone, right now.

457
00:21:40,583 --> 00:21:41,583
Kaori?

458
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:44,375
[KAORI]
I'm sorry, Nobuaki.

459
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:46,416
I'll see Yousuke again.

460
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:50,791
Thank you for telling me
how he felt.

461
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:56,625
You're crying. Oh, God.

462
00:21:56,708 --> 00:21:59,958
I did it.
This is all my fault.

463
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:05,333
Please forgive me.
Please, Kaori.

464
00:22:05,416 --> 00:22:07,333
Yousuke.
