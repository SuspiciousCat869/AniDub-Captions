00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:06,458
Everybody,
you should be in your seats.

163
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:09,625
Don't be such a troll.
Got it?

164
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:19,750
[NOBUAKI]
Nobody will believe me

165
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:22,083
if I try to explain it
without any proof.

166
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:24,375
I don't blame them.

167
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:27,750
We didn't really believe it
until people started dying.

168
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:29,125
We thought it was a joke.

169
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:33,500
Oh, there you are!

170
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:37,083
[panting]

171
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:41,791
That was a pretty dumb way
of telling her you like her.

172
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:43,500
But if you really have
a thing for Natsuko,

173
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:47,000
then I can give you some help.
Just don't make me regret it.

174
00:10:48,416 --> 00:10:50,375
Because the thing is,

175
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:53,041
I happen to know that
she's interested in you too.

176
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:55,708
So, here's the deal.

177
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:58,875
I'm gonna give you her phone
number so you can call her.

178
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:01,916
-Can you please get outta here?
-Huh?

179
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,791
I'm sorry.

180
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:07,125
-I was being weird earlier.
-What's with you?

181
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,625
Is that how you treat someone
who's trying to do you a favor?

182
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:14,291
-Please, just leave me alone!
-You are such a pain.

183
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:18,916
[sighs]

184
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,125
[NOBUAKI] If I don't obey
the order, then I'm gonna die.

185
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:27,875
But I don't wanna drag
Natsuko down with me.

186
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:32,916
There's really no hope
for either of us, anyway.

187
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,375
If we're all gonna die,
it might be better to go first.

188
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:45,541
It's almost been 24 hours.

189
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:48,541
I guess that's the end
for us both.

190
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:51,458
[panting]

191
00:11:51,541 --> 00:11:55,125
Wow. The stars
are gorgeous tonight.

192
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:57,750
But you'll miss them
if you keep your head down.

193
00:11:57,833 --> 00:12:00,458
-Natsuko?
-I've been looking everywhere.

194
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:02,375
I'm so glad I found you.

195
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:03,916
Aimi said you were
acting kinda strange

196
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,541
when she talked to you today.

197
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:07,791
Are you worried about
what happened in class?

198
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:10,333
Or is it something else,
did I do something wrong?

199
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:12,458
[chiming]

200
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,291
-Please just go.
-But we've barely talked.

201
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:19,041
And what about
the King's orders?

202
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:20,208
You said it was real,

203
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:21,416
so shouldn't we think
about what--

204
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,458
I can't kiss you!

205
00:12:27,291 --> 00:12:29,291
Sorry.

206
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:31,791
Is it 'cause you've got
your eye on someone else?

207
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:36,166
Yeah. There's a girl
who I will never forget.

208
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:51,791
Oh, an old girlfriend?

209
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:54,583
Was it a bad breakup?
How'd it go down?

210
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:57,500
It might help you
to talk about it.

211
00:12:57,583 --> 00:12:59,458
I guess we're long-distance now.

212
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:03,791
She's gone far away.
This might sound kinda weird.

213
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:06,291
But have you ever thought
about what heaven is like?

214
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:08,833
Actually, I don't believe
that heaven is real.

215
00:13:08,916 --> 00:13:10,833
What matters the most
is the here and now,

216
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:13,208
the actions we perform
while we're still alive.

217
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:15,541
Hey. What are you doing?

218
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:19,083
It's cool, I'm totally fine.

219
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:24,708
Thanks for the catch.

220
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:26,458
[chiming]

221
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:31,250
A text from the king.
Sixty seconds remaining.

222
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:36,666
-No, please get away from me.
-Listen,

223
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,541
I don't know what happened
with that girl or anything,

224
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:40,750
but maybe I can help you
work your way through it.

225
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:43,500
Trust me, there's nothing
you can do to help.

226
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:48,500
You're lying. Otherwise,
you wouldn't be crying.

227
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:56,875
From day one, I liked you.

228
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:59,208
I'd really love it
if you went out with me.

229
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:02,916
Our time is almost over now.

230
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,125
So, would it be okay
if I kissed you?

231
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:06,708
No!

232
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:10,791
-You're seriously saying no?
-I am.

233
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:14,875
Your girlfriend
is really lucky, I'm jealous.

234
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:16,541
[chiming]

235
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:19,375
Must be him.

236
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:21,791
That means it's time
for our punishment.

237
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:35,500
[NOBUAKI]
Her lips are so cold.

238
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:39,125
I'm not the type
who gives up easily.

239
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:41,125
-What?
-Consider that kiss a challenge

240
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:43,208
for your long-distance
girlfriend.

241
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:45,958
[NOBUAKI]
She's so happy, and kind.

242
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:48,333
The whole class loves her.

243
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:51,250
She hasn't done
a single thing wrong.

244
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:55,791
-I'm so sorry about this.
-It's okay.

245
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:58,250
But your words and actions
don't match up at all.

246
00:14:58,333 --> 00:15:00,125
What's with you?

247
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:02,166
[chiming]

248
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:05,208
Do you feel anything weird
starting to happen to you?

249
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:08,208
Well, my heart's
definitely pounding hard.

250
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:10,708
[NOBUAKI] Why am I getting
so many texts right now?

251
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:13,333
The punishment should
have already started.

252
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:21,708
I screwed up.

253
00:15:21,791 --> 00:15:24,583
I assumed the text from Aimi
was the punishment message.

254
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:27,250
We must have kissed
before midnight.

255
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:32,875
So, that means
the other texts...

256
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:49,750
Deep rest? So does that mean?

257
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:52,291
Natsuko, you have to call
every classmate you can

258
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:54,125
and tell them
not to go to sleep!

259
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:56,625
-Why, what's going on?
-Just hurry up and do it!

260
00:15:56,708 --> 00:15:58,750
[chiming]

261
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:04,750
Damn it!
It's happening.

262
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:07,458
The two of them
must've been asleep already.

263
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:10,125
-Nobu, what's wrong?
-Natsuko.

264
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:13,041
Which of our classmates
lives closest to where we are?

265
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:16,791
I think, Furusawa Tsubasa
is around here?

266
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:19,250
He lives at the block
four intersection.

267
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:22,250
All right, then.
I'm heading to Tsubasa's house.

268
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:24,208
Remember, call every
classmate you can,

269
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:26,750
tell them they have to
stay awake no matter what.

270
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:28,500
And have everyone meet up
somewhere together.

271
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:30,291
Nobu, you're scaring me.

272
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:33,875
-I don't understand what--
-Please help.

273
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:36,583
Right now, you're the only
person I can count on.

274
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:40,541
Nobu!

275
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Come on, please, you gotta
open the door right now!

276
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:50,583
What do you want?

277
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:55,375
You get your ass back here now!

278
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:58,541
I've got you.
Hon, call the police!

279
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:02,041
Damn it! Let go!
Tsubasa!

280
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:13,916
Tsubasa, what are...?

281
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,041
What's happening?

282
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:20,041
Quick, somebody call
an ambulance!

283
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:22,416
Now, or he's not
gonna make it!

284
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,375
[FATHER]
No! Tsubasa!

285
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:35,000
[panting]

286
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:37,666
[chiming]

287
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:47,458
I was too late.

288
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:49,458
And now all of
those kids are dead.

289
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:51,666
[murmuring]

290
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:55,000
[GIRL] This is so stupid.
Why the hell are we out here?

291
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:56,458
-I'm tired.
-Yeah, me, too.

292
00:17:56,541 --> 00:17:57,833
-So lame.
-Who all are we missing?

293
00:17:57,916 --> 00:17:59,750
Couple of people.

294
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:01,791
[GIRL] I don't even know
what's going on.

295
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:03,916
[panting]

296
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:09,750
Hey! I need everyone to stay
calm and listen to me closely.

297
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:13,000
God. What the hell's been up
with you the last few days?

298
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:15,958
First the kiss, and now these
hangings, it's not funny.

299
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:19,291
-No. It's true!
-Explain something to me.

300
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:20,750
Why won't the guy who's joking

301
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:23,541
about our classmates dying
answer his damn phone?

302
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:25,666
[murmuring]

303
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:31,708
Um. I have bad news.

304

[sobbing]

305
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:38,416
When I was on my way over here,
I stopped by Nanami's house.

306
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:42,666
And she-- I found her dead.
She was hanging in her room.

307
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:47,416
-What, no! You can't be serious.
-It could be a serial killer!

308
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,041
You're wrong. It's not a person
that's doing this!

309
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:53,750
How long are you gonna keep
saying this crap, you idiot?

310
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:54,958
Our friends are dying.

311
00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:56,208
All I'm doing
is telling the truth.

312
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:58,666
And how do you know all this?

313
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:01,583
Because...
this is not the first time

314
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:03,708
that my class has played
the King's Game.

00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:08,666
Okay, so explain it to us.

318
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:11,083
What happened the last time
you played the King's Game?

319
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:13,583
-It's your fault.
-What did you get us all into?

320
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:16,291
Start talking.
Tell us everything you know.

321
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,083
My classmates died.
Only I survived.

322
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:24,125
[gasping, murmuring]

323
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:28,375
This is not the kind of thing
that I would joke about!

324
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:30,916
We didn't believe this nightmare
was real at first, either,

325
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,875
but then it started,
and we couldn't stop it.

326
00:19:33,958 --> 00:19:35,875
One by one, my friends all died.

327
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:39,291
So, if we disobey the king's
orders, we're dead, too?

328
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:41,708
But Natsuko said that
you refused to kiss her!

329
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:48,583
-You knew about the punishments.
-I did.

330
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:51,166
Then when you turned her down,
you basically tried to kill her!

331
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:52,583
[gasps]

332
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:54,750
I don't really care
if you have a death wish,

333
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:57,125
but you were going to get
her killed along with you!

334
00:19:57,208 --> 00:19:59,375
-Aimi--
-Don't you dare take his side.

335
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:01,583
If it's true, I'll never
forgive this creep.

336
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:06,041
It's true.
Murazumi's right about me.

337
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:10,916
-[MURAZUMI] You're disgusting.
-[BOY] What a piece of shit!

338
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,333
-Murderer!
-Scum!

339
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:13,541
-Hit him.
-Murderer!

340
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:16,458
-Kick his ass!
-You're sick!

341
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:19,833
-I'm so sorry!
-Shut your mouth!

342
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:21,666
Screw this King's Game!

343
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:27,375
You and whoever else
is behind this

344
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:29,208
can both go straight to hell.

345
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:31,875
-Stop, it! We have to stay calm!
-Natsuko.

346
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:34,333
You realize this guy
almost got you murdered, right?

347
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:36,458
-I don't think that.
-Hey.

348
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:39,708
Who here thinks he's the one
sending all these creepy texts?

349
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:41,333
[GIRL]
It's gotta be him!

350
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:43,291
[BOY] I'll bet he's the one
killing people.

351
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:46,666
-Wait! I don't--
-Shut up!

352
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:48,083
[screams]

353
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:49,541
No, let me go.

354
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:52,625
I'm just trying to help
everyone! Please stop--

355
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:54,333
We've heard
just about everything

356
00:20:54,416 --> 00:20:56,166
we need to from you,
you bastard.

357
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,458
You're nothing
but a damn murderer.

358
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:01,208
-Hey, look at this.
-Huh?

359
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:04,500
Yuuichi, it says
you got a punishment.

360
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:19,250
[gasps]

361
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:24,666
[retches]

362
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,375
What the hell?

363
00:21:29,541 --> 00:21:32,500
What'd you do to me?

364
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:35,208
Nothing, it wasn't me!

365
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:37,333
[grunting]

366
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:46,458
[screaming]

367
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:51,250
Help... me.

368
00:22:00,458 --> 00:22:02,541
[whimpering]

369
00:22:03,958 --> 00:22:06,000
[sobbing]

370
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:16,000
[NOBUAKI]
There's no stopping it.

371
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:18,875
A new King's Game has begun.
