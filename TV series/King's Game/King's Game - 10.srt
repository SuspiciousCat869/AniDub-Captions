[NATSUKO]
New order.

3
00:00:16,625 --> 00:00:19,375
All class members are to run
to the summit of Nuegakubi.

4
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,500
Every eight hours,
the class member farthest

5
00:00:23,583 --> 00:00:25,541
from the summit
will be punished.

6
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:29,041
You may not use means
of transport, equipment, etc.

[RYOU laughing]

9
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,208
Teru. Tell me what you think!

10
00:02:10,625 --> 00:02:13,125
Ryou, you've gotta pull
yourself together.

11
00:02:13,208 --> 00:02:16,166
But the hat.
I wanna know if he likes it.

12
00:02:17,416 --> 00:02:20,541
Why are you just sitting there?
You saw the new order, right?

13
00:02:20,625 --> 00:02:23,291
Do you have any idea
how far Nuegakubi is from here?

14
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:25,250
We have to get moving, fast.

15
00:02:28,458 --> 00:02:29,750
[NOBUAKI]
She killed him.

16
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:35,416
Ryou, listen, please.
The King's already texted again.

17
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,833
Focus on surviving right now,
that's what Teruaki would want.

18
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:41,875
I can't yet. He told me
he was gonna give me a haircut

19
00:02:41,958 --> 00:02:43,583
before the next round started.

20
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:46,833
Don't you get it?
Teruaki is dead.

21
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:48,083
He can't be.

22
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:50,541
He promised
everything would be okay.

23
00:02:50,625 --> 00:02:53,416
I know this is hard.
But think how upset he'd be

24
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,416
if you stopped fighting
for your life.

25
00:03:06,916 --> 00:03:08,250
[AIMI]
Aren't you going, too?

26
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:12,083
Natsuko started running
as fast as she could.

27
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:15,250
Of course she did.
We should go.

28
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:19,791
I'm good.
I think I'll stay right here.

29
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:20,750
Aimi.

30
00:03:21,708 --> 00:03:23,250
It's not the time to give up.

31
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:24,583
Whoever's farthest
from the summit

32
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:26,875
will be punished in eight hours.

33
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:29,125
And we both know,
that likely means death.

34
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:30,708
[AIMI]
Yeah.

35
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:32,833
[NOBUAKI] Have you really lost
the will to live?

36
00:03:32,916 --> 00:03:34,625
[AIMI]
I think so. Sorry.

37
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:36,291
Come on,
there's got to be something

38
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:37,708
you wanna say to Natsuko.

39
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:43,833
Tell her, "Good luck."

40
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:49,500
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

41
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:52,125
You're going to have
to wish her luck yourself.

42
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:55,250
[AIMI] That's enough.
Put me down!

43
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:57,916
Not until you promise me
that you'll start running.

44
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,541
You gotta find Natsuko
and give her

45
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:01,250
a piece of your mind
for leaving you.

46
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:03,458
Are you an idiot?

47
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:05,916
I must be.

48
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,916
Here I am trying
to force you to stay alive

49
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,041
when you're trying
to sacrifice yourself.

50
00:04:11,916 --> 00:04:13,666
But I can't abandon you.

51
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:16,041
I'm not gonna let any more
of my classmates die.

52
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:18,041
Too many of you
are gone already.

53
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:21,541
[AIMI]
Okay, fine. I promise I'll run.

54
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:24,291
[NOBUAKI]
Good.

55
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:26,916
The others have
a pretty big lead on us,

56
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,458
so we should hurry up.

57
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:31,625
Why are you trying so hard
to save all of us, anyway?

58
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:33,833
What, do I really need
a reason?

Oh, my bad, Masatoshi.

At least now I know
I won't be last.

65
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:10,750
Masatoshi!

66
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:12,291
Why?

67
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:14,125
It's not fair.

68
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:15,875
[MATSUOKA]
Are you okay?

69
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:17,416
Takuya!

70
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,958
How could you do
something like this?

71
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:21,416
I thought we all agreed
that we'd work together!

72
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,000
We'd keep each other safe!

73
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:25,708
After Teru's big speech,

74
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:28,291
I was almost convinced
there for a second.

75
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:30,125
But he's dead now,
and I wanna live.

76
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:36,666
Masatoshi!
Come on, say something!

77
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:39,916
It's too late.
We should get going now, Aya.

78
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,625
He's alive!
Just unconscious, that's all.

79
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:44,375
He's not gonna be
running anytime soon,

80
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:45,875
so worry about yourself.

81
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:48,041
We can at least call
an ambulance to come get him.

82
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:50,208
We just don't have
the time to do that.

83
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:52,833
Besides, it'd probably count
as a mode of transportation,

84
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:54,958
which means that
he'd be breaking the rules.

85
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:57,041
-I know, but...
-Come on.

you can do for him now.

we barely have enough time

We're cutting it
close already.

If you wait around
for Masatoshi,

92
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:10,000
there's no way you'll make it
by the end of the day.

Do you understand
what I'm saying?

Sorry, Masatoshi.

that I'm heartless.

She doesn't look so good.

Don't mind me.

00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:43,375
Keep running. I'm just
gonna rest a little bit.

104
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:47,541
Hey, Aimi.
Will you keep Riona company?

105
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:53,291
Where's he headed off to, now?

106
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:54,375
I don't know.

107
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:01,958
Hey, seeing Teruaki die
back there,

108
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:03,458
it really made me think.

109
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:07,291
It's weird.

110
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:09,041
I never imagined
my own death.

111
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:11,125
I never even thought
about dying.

112
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:13,250
That sounds pretty normal.

113
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:15,250
Yes, but not anymore.

114
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:17,333
Of course.

115
00:07:18,375 --> 00:07:21,625
You know,
I researched the King's Game.

116
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:23,583
I was sure I'd find
a way to beat it.

117
00:07:23,666 --> 00:07:25,875
There was no way
it was going to ruin my life.

118
00:07:26,916 --> 00:07:29,500
Now look at me.
I'm just so tired.

119
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:34,583
Sure, but...
Nobuaki hasn't given up yet.

120
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:37,541
He's a really fast runner,

121
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:40,375
but the whole way here
he was matching my slower pace.

122
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:43,333
He's still helping everyone out,
even though it could kill him.

123
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:48,750
I wonder how he finds
the strength to do that.

124
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:53,666
It's kinda sad.
It's his second game.

125
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,708
I'm sure he's been through more
than either of us

126
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:57,000
could even imagine.

Don't either of you have
any sense of urgency?

-Keep running.
-Yeah.

00:08:21,416 --> 00:08:23,750
It'll be fine.
We can still make it.

I think the two of you
should just go on ahead.

There's no reason
to wait for me.

If you say so.

It's Masatoshi.

Takuya threw him down
some stairs on a bridge.

He was still alive
but unconscious,

154
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:19,291
and we left him like that.

155

still passed out there.

Probably far ahead of us by now.

You can't blame us for
leaving him behind. We had to!

like I'm a monster.

We all agreed
that it was best.

161
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:34,958
We had no other choice
at the time!

162
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:36,875
You don't have to worry.
All right?

163
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:39,291
The game is brutal, so I don't
blame you for running.

164
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:42,083
But I do think Aimi should
stay with you guys for now.

165
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:47,250
Well, does that sound good?
You'll be safer in a group.

166
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:52,208
[AIMI] We might survive this
after all, thanks to you

167
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:53,958
Yeah, she can join us.

168
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:55,958
But where are you
running off to?

169
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:04,958
[RIONA]
Stupid Nobuaki.

170
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:07,458
How are you gonna hold me
to my word if I don't make it?

171
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:10,083
You'll still be alive,
but I'll be dead.

172
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:12,416
Just a corpse lying
on the side of the road.

173
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:16,000
All alone.

174
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:20,583
[groans]

175
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,333
You're back. But why?

176
00:10:30,416 --> 00:10:31,791
You okay?

177
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:34,083
I just don't understand
what you're doing here.

178
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:37,291
It's simple. Your nails.

179
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:39,458
I remembered
how long they are now.

180
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:41,583
I figured it might be hard
to open your drink.

181
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:43,583
That's why you came
all this way?

182
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:46,625
Well, you were right.
So open it up already.

183
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:49,291
Ugh. You couldn't have
realized this earlier?

184
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:51,833
Yeah, sorry.

185
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:55,791
Here you go.
It's still kinda cold.

186
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,416
Wow, I feel better already.

187
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:11,000
-[footstep approaching]
-Uh...

188
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:16,375
-Who do you think it is?
-I don't know.

189
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:24,750
[NOBUAKI]
Masatoshi!

190
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:27,583
Hey, Nobuaki.

191
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:29,333
When did you two
get ahead of me?

192
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:32,333
Well...

193
00:11:32,416 --> 00:11:34,666
We should go.
We'll stick with you.

194
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:37,416
[NOBUAKI]
Just over four hours

195
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,666
until the first punishment
comes down.

196
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,125
Who will it be?

197
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:43,375
I doubt Riona does
much exercising.

198
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:45,541
She doesn't seem to have
a lot of stamina.

199
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:48,791
And I'm not sure how long
Masatoshi can keep this up.

200
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,958
He's running
on pure adrenaline right now.

201
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:52,291
When that runs out...

202
00:11:54,333 --> 00:11:56,375
[NATSUKO] [distorted voice]
You should give up on them.

203
00:11:56,458 --> 00:11:59,500
Just run ahead and let
someone else be punished.

204
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:05,208
Why don't you abandon them?
You'll survive if you do.

205
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:07,416
Isn't that what really matters?

206
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:10,958
Do it.

207
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:13,166
Get their deaths
out of the way quickly.

208
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:15,583
Wouldn't that be better
for them anyway?

209
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:17,166
Stop talking!

210
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:20,125
You're never going
to make me lose all my hope!

211
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:22,791
I won't allow you
to have your way.

212
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:25,041
I'm not gonna let
anyone else die!

213
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:27,750
It's time for you
to give up Nobu.

214
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:30,083
-[NOBUAKI] No!
-[RIONA gasps]

215
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,791
What's the matter, Nobuaki?
Is something wrong?

216
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:36,375
There's no way that
I can give up now.

217
00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:38,583
But if I die tonight,
it'll all be over.

218
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:40,250
Nobuaki!

219
00:12:41,791 --> 00:12:42,958
Oh, sorry.

220
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:45,291
I spaced out,
but I think I'm back now.

221
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:48,500
[scoffs]

222
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:50,083
Are you really not
thinking about the game?

223
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:52,208
No, it's not like that.

224
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:56,416
I was just trying to figure out
how all of us can survive.

225
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:59,333
So it's not that you're
distracted, but too focused.

226
00:12:59,416 --> 00:13:02,916
To be honest, I have my hands
full looking out for myself.

227
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,708
But you're always worried
about everybody else.

228
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:09,083
What's the deal?
What game are you playing?

229
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:11,125
The same one you are,
I can't help it.

230
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:13,208
Just forget about it.

231
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:15,583
I don't have the time
or energy to argue.

232
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:21,500
We should get going, too.

233
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:28,000
[NOBUAKI]
Yeah.

234
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,166
-[phone ringing]
-[ALL panting]

235
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:44,666
Hey, Nobuaki, is that you?
Where are you right now?

236
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:46,083
[NOBUAKI]
Behind you guys.

237
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:47,875
[RYOU]
We just passed by the coast.

238
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:50,291
Now we're in
the industrial area.

239
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:51,625
[NOBUAKI]
Got it.

240
00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:53,916
So, how far back are you?

241
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,583
[NOBUAKI]
Just keep running, Ryou.

242
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:56,791
The whole way.

243
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:58,500
Wish everyone
with you luck for me.

244
00:13:58,583 --> 00:14:00,458
-[line disconnects]
-Nobuaki?

245
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:02,333
What did he have to say?

246
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:04,291
Is he going to rejoin us
anytime soon?

247
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:07,333
Mm-hmm. Yeah, I think so.
He says "good luck."

248
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:10,375
Geez. Just when I thought
he couldn't get any softer.

249
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:12,083
Don't talk about
him that way!

250
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:16,500
He's not soft. He's a great guy
just like Teruaki. Got it?

251
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:18,916
They're strong enough
to put other people before them!

252
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,583
And I'm going to do everything
I can to be like them.

253
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:24,166
Ryou.

254
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:26,375
Ugh. How stupid.

255
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:29,291
[RYOU]
You'll be okay, right, Nobuaki?

256
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:31,625
You can make it
to the finish line.

-[footsteps]
-[panting]

Nobuaki, did you just call Ryou?

259
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:40,375
Yeah, just to check in.

260
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:42,750
[MASATOSHI] That guy needs
to worry about himself.

261
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:44,708
It's the only way
to survive this.

It's beautiful.

It really is, isn't it?

[RIONA]
Nobuaki.

266
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:03,000
I don't want you to hold
yourself back to help us.

267
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:04,958
What?

268
00:15:05,041 --> 00:15:07,833
If you match our pace, you won't
make it to the summit in time.

269
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:10,416
You should leave us behind
and head out on your own.

270
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:14,625
Yeah, she's right.
You're faster than this.

271

Are you trying to cop a feel
at a time like this?

Uh... Oh, Riona. I'm sorry.

289

Guess I'm more tired
than I thought.

Forgive me.

to forget who you're with.

So don't let it
happen again.

What are you doing?
Start swimming! Now!

you're doing?

Think of some way to save him
besides jumping in there.

There's no time.
I have to save him.

I'm not going to let you die.
Come on.

Please, open your eyes.
Stay alive!

You ran all this way already.

You can't let it
end here like this.

Don't you want
to get back at Takuya?

how stupid I am if you want to.

00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,166
All for nothing.

318
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,375
It's happening again.

319
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:54,583
Another one I couldn't save.

320
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,583
I can't do this.

321
00:17:57,666 --> 00:18:01,000
I can't watch
all my classmates die.

322
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:02,333
Not again.

323
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,250
I'm sorry.

324
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:08,250
-I'm done.
-[KENTA] What are you doing?

325
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:13,791
You can't save people
if you're not alive.

326
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:15,583
Get back to the surface.

327
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:18,958
Kenta, I can't take it anymore.

328
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:22,083
[MIZUKI] Riona's up there
crying, you know.

329
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:24,208
[NOBUAKI]
Mizuki.

330
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:27,083
Everyone's waiting
for you to catch up with them.

331
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:28,625
It doesn't matter.

332
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:30,416
I don't deserve
their friendship.

333
00:18:34,791 --> 00:18:36,375
Whoops, my bad.

334
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:38,583
I was just trying to lighten
the mood a little bit, you know.

335
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:41,375
[NOBUAKI]
You guys.

336
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:44,208
[CHIEMI]
Nobuaki.

337
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:52,958
Don't give up. Survive!

338
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:55,875
[NOBUAKI]
I remember.

339
00:18:55,958 --> 00:18:59,208
That was my final promise.
I told you I'd live.

340
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:02,375
For the both of us.

341
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:06,375
-[water splashing]
-Uh!

342
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:13,208
Just then.
I could feel her hand.

343
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:16,541
Nobuaki! Are you okay?

344
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,833
Well, I'm alive.

345
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:20,458
But I couldn't save him.

346
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:22,583
You did everything you could.

347
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:25,041
Now get out
of the water, you idiot.

348
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:36,458
Damn it.

349
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:38,333
[sobbing softly]

350
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:44,125
No.
[crying]

351
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:45,541
[chiming]

352
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:55,708
You had me
so worried about you.

353
00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:57,791
I'm gonna have to punish you
for that, you know?

354
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:01,958
Do whatever you want.
Not like it matters anyway.

355
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:04,166
[RIONA]
Cheer up.

356
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:06,125
This gloomy mood
doesn't suit you.

357
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:17,541
-Riona.
-Don't get the wrong idea, okay.

358
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:20,333
I'm just trying to warm you up
so you don't catch a cold.

359
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:22,166
This is a one-time
sorta deal.

360
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:24,250
It's not like I'm enjoying
this or anything.

361
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:28,333
Yeah, sure. I'm not either.

362
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:30,708
[RIONA sobbing]

363
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:33,208
I'm sad, too.
It's all so much.

364
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:37,583
And I was so afraid.
Scared you'd die.

365
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:40,250
So you gotta make sure
you survive this game.

366
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:48,208
Please, keep fighting.
For me. Won't you?

367
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:54,375
[NOBUAKI]
Yeah, I promise.

368
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:59,750
[RIONA] Okay, so, this bridge
connects Honshu and Totsujima.

369
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:04,291
The big islands connected by
land are Totsujima and Ochijima.

370
00:21:04,375 --> 00:21:05,791
The small islands beyond them

371
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:08,208
are Yomotsukajima
and Kakurejima.

372
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:11,416
We have cross all four islands
to get to Nuegakubi.

373
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,750
It's a long run.

374
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:14,625
[BOTH panting]

375
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:19,416
[NOBUAKI]
It's 7:55.

376
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,208
Almost time for
the first punishment.

377
00:21:22,291 --> 00:21:25,500
The person farthest from
Nuegakubi will be punished.

378
00:21:25,583 --> 00:21:26,958
Let's see.

379
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:28,875
If Masatoshi doesn't count
because he already died,

380
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:30,750
then that means
we're at the very back.

381
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:36,250
It's going to be me or Riona.
One of us will be punished.

382
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:37,666
Which means...

383
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:45,583
-Gotta stop here.
-What's wrong?

384
00:21:45,666 --> 00:21:48,916
Sorry. I gotta tie my shoelaces.
They just came undone.

385
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,041
-You go on ahead.
-You are so hopeless.

386
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:54,625
Just hurry up, I'll wait.

387
00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:56,125
[NOBUAKI]
Chiemi,

388
00:21:56,208 --> 00:21:58,916
I know I told you I'd live,
but I have to do this.

389
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,250
There's no way I can watch
more classmates die

390
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:02,750
in front of my eyes.

391
00:22:03,708 --> 00:22:05,333
[phones ring]

392
00:22:10,833 --> 00:22:14,375
Nobuaki! Did you do this
on purpose?
