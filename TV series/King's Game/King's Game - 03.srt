1
00:00:10,916 --> 00:00:12,750
Where are you, Nobuaki?

2
00:00:12,833 --> 00:00:14,541
I'm supposed to meet you.

3
00:00:14,625 --> 00:00:18,875
Akamatsu. Kenta.

4
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,708
It's Kenta?

5
00:00:22,791 --> 00:00:26,625
Wow, is the whole class here?
Are you guys out here

6
00:00:26,708 --> 00:00:29,041
to celebrate the big sports
day win or something?

7
00:00:29,125 --> 00:00:31,583
Huh? Ah!

8
00:00:32,541 --> 00:00:35,666
What the? Is that...
a body?

9
00:00:38,291 --> 00:00:42,750
Nobuaki!
Hey. You look pretty bad.

10
00:00:42,833 --> 00:00:46,500
Who did this to you?
What the hell? Do something!

11
00:00:46,583 --> 00:00:49,416
[KENTA] He's really hurt.
You have to help him!

12
00:00:51,416 --> 00:00:53,500
Wait a sec. You did it.

13
00:00:53,583 --> 00:00:55,541
No. I mean, yeah,
but we had to.

14
00:00:55,625 --> 00:00:58,083
-He brought it on himself.
-What?

15
00:00:58,166 --> 00:01:01,083
You had to gang up on him
and beat him half to death?

16
00:01:01,166 --> 00:01:03,916
I don't care whatever you think
Nobuaki deserves.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,041
I'm not gonna let you lynch him.
Instead, you can fight me.

18
00:02:40,708 --> 00:02:41,958
[thunder rumbles]

19
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:46,916
Kenta.

20
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,041
Nobuaki?
Try to stay awake, bro.

21
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:50,458
[coughs]

22
00:02:51,958 --> 00:02:54,375
Hey. Thank you, man.

23
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:55,791
Don't thank me.

24
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:58,125
Tell me what happened.
What the hell's going on?

25
00:02:58,208 --> 00:03:00,000
And what's with
that bloody mess?

26
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:03,166
-It's Yuuichi.
-What? No way.

27
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:08,708
Uh, what are you doing? C'mon.
Put on some clothes!

28
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:11,041
Oh, shut up.
You're interrupting.

29
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:13,875
We were just getting
to the fun part.

30
00:03:13,958 --> 00:03:15,333
You think this is fun?

31
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:18,083
One of your classmates
has been killed!

32
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:19,875
You're really starting
to annoy me.

33
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:21,583
Send this.

34
00:03:23,583 --> 00:03:24,708
But...

35
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:26,750
No! Why Kenta, too?

36
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:30,375
Mizuki, if you don't send
this text to two people,

37
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:32,083
you're going to be murdered.

38
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:34,041
You don't want to die.

39
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:36,000
Well, no.

40
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:37,916
Then show us
what beautiful deaths

41
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,541
the King has planned
for those two.

42
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:41,541
Pretty please?

43
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:44,708
[MIZUKI] I don't get it.
Why are you acting so strange?

44
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:47,833
I'm not. I'm trying to help.

45
00:03:47,916 --> 00:03:49,875
I'm just looking out
for you, Mizuki.

46
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:54,000
No! I can't do this.
It's way too messed up!

47
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:58,875
Mizuki...
you gotta do it. Text me.

48
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:03,458
Send the other one to Natsuko.

49
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:05,416
There's no way I can do that!

50
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,750
I can't kill someone!
It's wrong.

51
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:11,416
I don't want to do it.
I'm not a murderer!

52
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,875
Oh, no.
What have I done?

53
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:19,416
-You dumb cow.
-But wait...

54
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,875
[MIZUKI] I can just buy
a new phone, can't I?

55
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:25,083
-It'll be okay. Right?
-It's too late.

56
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:27,083
[Mizuki cries]

57
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:29,208
[NATSUKO]
Ugh, what a buzzkill.

58
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:32,041
Teruaki, let's get out of here.

59
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:34,083
-[Mizuki cries]
-Uh, hold on.

60
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:37,166
Oh, I didn't know you wanted
to die like Yuuichi.

61
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:38,958
You're not going anywhere!

62
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:43,375
Our classmate is
on the ground over there.

63
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:45,541
You can't leave.
We gotta stop this.

64
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:49,250
I agree.
What? He has a good point.

65
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:51,416
Crap.

66
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,833
I'm taking him
to the emergency room!

67
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:54,958
Hold on, okay?

68
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:58,250
Yeah? What is it?

69
00:04:58,333 --> 00:05:00,625
I'm going to
the hospital with you.

70
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:02,458
I don't want to be here.

71
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:08,666
Yeah, that's cool.
We can go together.

72
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:12,875
In that case,
won't you let me tag along, huh?

73
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:18,458
I cannot deal with this chick.
We're going.

74
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:21,791
Um, Natsuko?

75
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:29,041
I'm scared.
What should I do now.

76
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:32,666
I don't want to die,
but there's no way out of it.

77
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:36,041
[KENTA] Don't worry.
I'll fix this, you'll see.

78
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:38,583
Fix this?
And how is that going to work?

79
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:40,375
Don't say you're gonna
make things better

80
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:42,166
when there's nothing
you can do.

81
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:46,708
You're gonna be fine.
I keep my promises.

82
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:49,708
Look at this.
It's the order I got earlier.

83
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:53,291
[MIZUKI] He made you the King?
What are you gonna do?

84
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:54,875
I'll send it to myself,

85
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:56,791
saying "Protect
Yukimura Mizuki.

86
00:05:56,875 --> 00:05:59,750
Save her. Make sure
that she survives this."

87
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:01,416
How does that sound?

88
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,833
If I don't follow the order,
I'll die, too.

89
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:06,291
So you know I'll do
everything to protect you.

90
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:10,333
Kenta, thanks.

91
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:13,958
This King's Game thing
is such a mess.

92
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:15,333
The others were talking

93
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:17,583
as if it's all Nobuaki's fault
or something.

94
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:19,833
So, is it? What's the deal?

95
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:23,541
Yeah. It's true.
It's my fault.

96
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:26,916
I got you all involved.
Yuuichi, too.

97
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I may as well have
murdered him myself.

98
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:31,000
This isn't the first time.

99
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:34,166
I did things I can't take back
in the last game, too.

100
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:39,541
Be honest with us.
What happened to you back then?

101
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:41,458
[MAMI]
Nobuaki, is it true?

102
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:44,416
[MINAKO]
No. Daisuke can't be dead!

103
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,750
If he is,
then Hideki and Satomi

104
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:48,583
weren't just
a weird coincidence.

105
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:51,458
It's the game. That's the only
thing I'm sure of.

106
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:53,250
The King's Game
is totally real.

107
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:57,250
Impossible. Like,
I didn't think he would die.

108
00:06:57,333 --> 00:07:00,333
Listen up. All of us got
the new order, right?

109
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:03,958
Wait, you can't be serious.

110
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:05,750
[NOBUAKI] I think we have to
do the poll.

111
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:07,083
Are you a lunatic?

112
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:09,500
If we do that,
the loser might be murdered!

113
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:12,833
She's right. You're basically
asking us to kill a classmate.

114
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:14,208
Don't even joke about that.

115
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:15,958
We have to do it.

116
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:18,875
If we don't vote, both of us
will be punished.

117
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:21,250
That means we have no choice.

118
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:23,708
-Then, it's settled.
-Uh, yeah.

119
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:26,625
Let's agree here and now
that we won't blame anyone.

120
00:07:26,708 --> 00:07:28,916
No matter what happens,
we chose to do this.

121
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,708
[NOBUAKI] We'll cast our votes
at noon today.

122
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:37,458
In order to win this,
you need at least 16 votes.

123
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:39,500
Chiemi and I
will talk to the girls.

124
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:41,750
I bet we can sway
a few of them.

125
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:46,666
I don't think there's any way
we can convince them all,

126
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,958
but I'm close
to Kaori and Emi.

127
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:51,125
I can get them on our side.

128
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:54,083
Naoya, you talk
to the guys, okay?

129
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:55,416
Naoya?

130
00:07:56,416 --> 00:07:58,000
Look. I'm conflicted.

131
00:07:58,083 --> 00:08:00,708
If I win, then Kana's
gonna get punished.

132
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:03,000
If she gets killed,
it'd be on me.

133
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:04,583
Don't be ridiculous.

134
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:06,875
This is no time to worry
about someone else, okay?

135
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:08,625
Yeah, but--

136
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:11,166
Listen to me, you can't
afford to think about her.

137
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,958
I don't care about
this stupid game,

138
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:14,375
I'm not going to lose you!

139
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:16,166
Nobuaki.

140
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:19,416
[NOBUAKI] Please, you have to
vote for Naoya!

141
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,875
He's my closest friend.
I am begging you.

142
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:24,583
I'll never ask
for anything else.

143
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:25,708
Sure.

144
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:27,250
[KANA]
Misaki!

145
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:31,541
Come on. I'm trusting you
to do the right thing.

146
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:34,166
That means you have to write
my name on your ballot.

147
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:37,666
I mean, you and me,
we're friends, right?

148
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:40,541
[NOBUAKI] I don't want to let
Naoya die. Please, Misaki!

149
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:42,708
[KANA] I know you're on my side!
Aren't you, Misaki?

150
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:44,333
[NOBUAKI]
I'll do anything. Please!

151
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:45,416
[KANA]
Misaki, save me!

152
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,875
Stop it!

153
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:50,083
Don't ask me to do this.

154
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:52,291
I can't choose
between the two of them.

155
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:55,208
I can't. I can't do it.

156
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,083
Daisuke was our friend,
and I couldn't save him.

157
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:04,208
And now, I just couldn't
bear to lose Naoya.

158
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:07,750
It would break me.
Please, save my best friend.

159
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:10,666
-Misaki, let Naoya live.
-Nobuaki!

160
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,791
You're using Daisuke's death
to get an extra vote?

161
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:14,833
You're a coward!

162
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:16,041
[NAOYA]
No he's not!

163
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:18,666
He has more courage
than anyone here!

164
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:21,916
He's fighting desperately
to save my life.

165
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,625
He's down on his hands
and knees.

166
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:24,875
Where the hell do you get off

167
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:27,208
calling someone
like that a coward?

168
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:29,875
Naoya, I'll vote for you.

169
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:31,541
You were Daisuke's friend,

170
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:33,833
and it's thanks to him
I didn't get punished.

171
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:35,750
It seems right that
in his memory I should--

172
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,208
You're a little traitor!

173
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:40,750
Do you even understand
what you're saying right now?

174
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:43,458
You're basically telling me
you want me dead.

175
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:46,500
-No, that's not it.
-You're truly awful, Misaki.

176
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:48,750
I thought we were friends.

177
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:50,750
[KANA]
Damn it!

178
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:53,250
This isn't a joke.

179
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:56,708
And the last thing I'm going
to do is die for Naoya.

180
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:59,458
Damn this stupid game.
I'll win.

181
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:03,000
No matter what I have to do.
I'll come out on top!

182
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:07,000
[KANA]
Akira, please.

183
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:08,583
[AKIRA]
Seriously Kana?

184
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:10,291
[KANA]
I'm just so scared.

185
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:13,833
And if I lose, I'll never be
able to talk to you again.

186
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:17,416
Oh, Akira,
your hands are so warm.

187
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,166
Well, I am a man,
so I should protect you.

188
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:22,208
I'll make sure
nothing happens to you.

189
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:24,750
-You have my word.
-Thank you!

190
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:28,166
And after I win.
I'll do whatever you want me to.

191
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,750
[KANA]
I Promise.

192
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:31,708
[AKIRA]
Really? You mean anything?

193
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:34,375
[SHOUTA]
Hey man.

194
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:37,625
About Daisuke,
I'm sorry for what happened.

195
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:39,125
I can't believe he died

196
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:41,750
over what I thought
was some stupid joke,

197
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:43,541
and I'm-- I'm scared.

198
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:45,041
[SHOUTA]
I don't know what to do about

199
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:47,541
this whole popularity vote
thing, either.

200
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:50,416
No matter whose name I put down,
I'm killing someone!

201
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:53,958
And, I don't want to feel
like a murderer again!

202
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:55,750
You know?
So, then...

203
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:57,583
what the hell
am I supposed to do?

204
00:10:57,666 --> 00:10:59,666
Well, for starters,
you could stop whining.

205
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:04,708
Daisuke's death was a tragedy,
but it wasn't all your fault.

206
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:06,333
If I'd been more careful,

207
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:09,208
then I would have been able
to save him myself.

208
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:11,791
-You don't know that.
-Sure.

209
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:13,791
Our one vote
might kill somebody,

210
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:16,416
but you have to think
of in it another way.

211
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,750
Your vote could also
save somebody.

212
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:22,000
I'm trying to save
my best friend.

213
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:24,541
That's all I want.
My only goal.

214
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:26,125
Listen to me.

215
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:28,125
I don't want to owe you
anything later,

216
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:30,333
so there's something
you should know.

217
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:33,291
Right now, the way
things are lookin',

218
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:34,458
your buddy's gonna lose.

219
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:36,458
[SHOUTA]
Kana's whoring herself out

220
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:38,375
to all the guys for their votes.

221
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:40,000
Like, legitimately.

222
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:42,041
She's already done it
with a bunch of them.

223
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:44,125
She's doing whatever it takes.

224
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:46,708
-Doing whatever they want.
-No way.

225
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:48,375
But there are lives
riding on this.

226
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:51,083
[SHOUTA]
No shit, hers is one of 'em.

227
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:52,458
Shingo,

228
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:54,458
you're going to vote
for Naoya, aren't you?

229
00:11:54,541 --> 00:11:56,666
Yeah, obviously I'm going to.

230
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,666
Good to hear. I trust you.

231
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:01,125
Sure. I bet
he's got this in the bag.

232
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:03,208
You can definitely
count on my vote.

233
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:09,250
Can we?

234
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:12,666
Yeah, I've got your backs man,
we're friends after all.

235
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:17,708
Do you get it now?
He's in real trouble.

236
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:20,458
Well, I don't think
it'll make a difference,

237
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:23,541
but after what happened
with Daisuke, he's got my vote.

238
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,291
All right, now I'm going
to count the votes.

239
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:53,416
Naoya, Kana,
are you two ready?

240
00:12:55,833 --> 00:13:01,375
For Kana. Kana.
Kana. Naoya! Kana.

241
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:04,666
-[NOBUAKI] Kana. Naoya. Naoya.
-[KANA] What a loser.

242
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,750
There's no point
in even counting.

243
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:10,333
[NOBUAKI]
Kana. Naoya.

244
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,333
[KANA]
No, no, that can't be right.

245
00:13:13,416 --> 00:13:15,416
How are the numbers
so close together?

246
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,208
After all I did for this.

247
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:19,541
What the hell are you people
trying to pull?

248
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:22,375
If I lose, I die,
do they not get that?

249
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:24,416
-No. I'm going to win this.
-[NOBUAKI] Naoya.

250
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,958
I'll survive, I swear.

251
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:27,750
[NOBUAKI]
Naoya.

252
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:31,208
This is the last vote.

253
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:33,375
The name on this
decides who wins.

254
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:36,625
You ass.

255
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:38,000
I bet you're planning to cheat.

256
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:39,041
Give me that!

257
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:40,708
There's no way I'll lose.

258
00:13:40,791 --> 00:13:42,833
My name has to be
written on this slip.

259
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:44,458
My name.

260
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:58,125
Ah! I win. [laughs]
I didn't need to worry.

261
00:13:58,208 --> 00:14:01,416
There was no way he'd beat me
in a popularity contest.

262
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:07,166
Not so fast.
You didn't read all of it.

263
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:08,291
Huh?

264
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:12,541
This vote is for Naoya.

265
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:19,500
[KANA] You messed with the vote,
didn't you?

266
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:21,291
You cheated somehow!

267

[phones ringing]

268
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:30,125
No! I don't want to be
punished and killed.

00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:32,250
I don't want to hang to death!

00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,500

[Nobuaki cries]

279
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:15,625
[NAOYA]
Do you think

280
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:17,083
she's gonna make it?

281
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:19,625
[NOBUAKI]
Obviously it's really bad.

282

The doctors aren't sure
she's live through the night.

283
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:24,916
Man, I feel awful,

284
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,958
but I'd be dead
if it weren't for your help.

285
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:28,750
I don't even know
how to begin to thank you

286
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:30,125
for everything you've done.

287
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:31,791
Seriously man,
you're like my hero right now.

288
00:15:31,875 --> 00:15:33,916
-No, I'm not a hero.
-Why?

289
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,041
Earlier,
I did something horrible

290
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:37,458
to make sure
that you would win the vote,

291
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:38,958
I pulled an evil trick.

292
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:40,500
[NAOYA]
What do you mean?

293
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,958
I sent this to people
who might vote for Kana

294
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:46,000
and fooled them
into putting your name.

295
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:48,208
[NAOYA] You said you had a way
to escape the King's Game?

296
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:50,166
I tricked them
into voting for you.

297
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:53,708
Dude, if they ever find out,
they're gonna go insane.

298
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:57,958
Yeah, they'll beat me up,
if not something even worse.

299
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:00,000
No. I won't let them.

300
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:01,750
You don't need
to worry about it.

301
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:03,500
The way I planned things,

302
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,458
I don't think there's that much
of a chance they'll attack me.

303
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:06,500
And why's that?

304
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:07,958
[NOBUAKI]
Like I said,

305
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:10,500
the trick I pulled
was especially bad.

306
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:13,250
Everyone who got
that message thinks

307
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:16,125
they were the only person
I was offering an escape to.

308
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:18,708
Plus, they had to respond
within five minutes.

309
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:20,625
Without any time
to think it through,

310
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:22,083
I knew they'd eventually
end up choosing

311
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:23,708
to betray Kana
in the end.

312
00:16:23,791 --> 00:16:25,375
If they tell anyone,

313
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:27,708
they'll be accused of stabbing
their friend in the back,

314
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:30,541
not to mention abandoning
the rest of their classmates.

315
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:32,791
So there's no way
they can say anything.

316
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:34,500
That's why
the trick is so evil.

317
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:37,625
I made them drive
their friend to death

318
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:40,375
with a fake promise that
they'd be able to survive this.

319
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:42,708
-I'm nothing but a monster.
-No way!

320
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:44,875
You're not the one
to blame for this, Nobuaki.

321
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:46,583
The King is
the only monster.

322
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:47,958
-[gasps]
-You put yourself through

323
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:50,500
absolute hell to save
your best friend's life.

324
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:52,916
Do you really think
a monster would do that?

325
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:55,250
I don't know.

326
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:02,083
It's almost time for an order.

327
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:05,125
Maybe we'll luck out.
Maybe no message will come.

328
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:07,875
I don't think we're that lucky,
but whatever the King wants,

329
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:10,208
I promise that I'll protect
the both of you.

330
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:11,500
Nobuaki.

331
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:14,708
You guys are so cute together.
For real.

332
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:18,000
I'm kinda jealous, actually.

333
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:20,333
I feel like I'm never gonna
get a girl to like me.

334
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:21,666
[NOBUAKI]
What?

335
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,041
Where's all of this
suddenly coming from?

336
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,958
Don't worry.
You're such a good guy, Naoya.

337
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:28,625
I bet you'll get a girlfriend
better than me in no time.

338
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:30,041
Please, he wishes.

339
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:32,416
Naoya's not exactly good
at understanding girls.

340
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,208
[CHIEMI] I bet I know someone
who's even more clueless.

341
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:37,250
[NOBUAKI]
Who's that?

342
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:41,125
[beeping]

343
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:42,958
[flatline]

344
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:45,458
[phones ringing]

345
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:50,708
[NOBUAKI]
But why Naoya?

346
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:53,625
I get that Kana
couldn't obey her order,

347
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:56,166
but he shouldn't
have to do it.

348
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:06,458
Damn it! But it's ten
minutes to midnight!

349
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:08,208
What do we do?

350
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:11,000
Yeah, there's no way
I can complete the order.

351
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:16,208
[screams]

352
00:18:19,541 --> 00:18:21,291
Do you have a plan?

353
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:24,916
[CHIEMI]
Wait. Nobuaki?

354
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,583
[NAOYA]
Where are you taking us?

355
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:33,541
Hey, what are you doing?
Open up!

356
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:34,833
Naoya!

357
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:36,708
Hurry up and carry out
the damn order!

358
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:40,208
I want you to survive.

359
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:43,000
No. You can't be serious.

360
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:46,250
Chiemi!
Please, do it.

361
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,583
You're the only one
who can save him now!

362
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:52,500
You're talking crazy!
I love both of you guys,

363
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:54,666
so I couldn't sleep
with her, ever!

364
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,875
I can't.
I'd be betraying both of you.

365
00:18:56,958 --> 00:18:59,916
Please do it!
If you don't obey, you'll die.

366
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,500
Maybe I don't care
if I die, you idiot!

367
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:05,250
It'd be better than
hurting either of you.

368
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:08,916
Naoya, come on.
We don't have a choice here.

369
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,208
[CHIEMI]
If this is what it takes

370
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:12,875
to save your life,
so be it.

371
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:15,208
I'll be honest,
I don't wanna burn to death.

372
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:16,458
But, still--

373
00:19:16,541 --> 00:19:18,166
I don't think I could
live with myself

374
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:20,000
if I betrayed the two of you!

375
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:24,375
You're betraying us now.

376
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:25,791
[NAOYA]
No. I'm not!

377
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:28,333
I'm begging you, dammit,
sleep with Chiemi!

378
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:30,875
I can't. There's no way!

379
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:33,250
[screams]

380
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:34,708
No. I won't.

381
00:19:34,791 --> 00:19:36,708
Will you just let me die
with some honor?

382
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:44,416
But, why?

383
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:48,416
Please, hurry.
Do it while he's unconscious.

384
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:07,250
[cries]

385
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:09,833
[phone rings]

386
00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:24,000
I'm sorry.
I'm the worst man alive.

387
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:26,083
No. I love you,

388
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:28,416
more than anything else
in this world.

389
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,750
That's why it hurt to do this.

390
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:33,375
I love you so much
that I could die right now!

391
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:36,375
[CHIEMI]
Please, promise me something.

392
00:20:36,458 --> 00:20:38,250
No matter what,

393
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:41,708
promise me that there's no way
you'll die before I do.

394
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:45,458
Chiemi.

395
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:52,125
That's so sad.

396
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:53,250
Yeah.

397
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:54,708
Sure.

398
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:56,833
Maybe you did some
unforgivable things,

399
00:20:56,916 --> 00:20:58,416
things you wish
you could take back.

400
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,416
That said,
you know what?

401
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:04,791
I still just can't see you
as a bad guy, not deep down.

402
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:07,875
Yeah, but I made
my best friend...

403
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:10,208
Most people couldn't
go that far.

404
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:12,750
Like you said,
you did it to save his life.

405
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:15,916
The King.
He's the one who's unforgivable.

406
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,750
You sound like...

407
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:21,208
You are not the one
to blame for this.

408
00:21:21,291 --> 00:21:23,000
The King is the monster!

409
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:25,541
[KENTA]
Nobuaki,

410
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:28,208
you've lost a lot of people
who were important to you.

411
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:30,583
You've been through
so much intense pain.

412
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:32,458
I bet you can't even
put it into words,

413
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:36,291
But you are not alone.
You can lean on us.

414
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:42,625
I-- All I wanted to do
was to save everyone.

415
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:48,208
It's all gonna be okay.

416
00:21:48,291 --> 00:21:50,916
When this is over, you'll be
crying tears of relief.

417
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,291
[NOBUAKI]
Sure. [cries]

00:21:57,958 --> 00:21:59,458
[AIMI]
Natsuko.

419
00:21:59,541 --> 00:22:00,833
What do you think
will happen now?

420
00:22:00,916 --> 00:22:02,208
[NATSUKO]
If you don't want to die,

421
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:03,458
then all of you will do

422
00:22:03,541 --> 00:22:05,166
exactly as I say, understand?
