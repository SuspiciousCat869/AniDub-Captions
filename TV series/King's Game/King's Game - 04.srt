Sorry. No one's answering.

3
00:00:16,291 --> 00:00:19,125
Do you think it might've fallen
out of your pocket at the park?

4
00:00:19,208 --> 00:00:20,333
Don't worry about it.

5
00:00:20,416 --> 00:00:22,125
You still need to get
to the hospital.

6
00:00:22,208 --> 00:00:24,333
I'll head back to the park
and look for your phone.

7
00:00:24,416 --> 00:00:27,208
No. There's somewhere else
I have to go,

gets any more insane.

A ghost town.

The key to ending
the King's Game could be there.

[NOBUAKI]
Happened about 40 years ago.

15
00:00:43,583 --> 00:00:46,291
A King's Game,
likely the first one,

16
00:00:46,375 --> 00:00:48,541
started in a little
farming village.

17
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:51,916
It was a completely
ordinary place.

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,208
Peaceful. Boring, even.
Until one day,

19
00:00:55,291 --> 00:00:57,708
a single scrap of paper
changed everything.

20
00:00:57,791 --> 00:01:01,583
A note in a black envelope,
an order from the King.

21
00:01:02,625 --> 00:01:03,750
Because of the game,

22
00:01:03,833 --> 00:01:05,708
the villagers
started to disappear.

23
00:01:05,791 --> 00:01:08,250
By the end of it,
the entire town was abandoned.

24
00:01:09,208 --> 00:01:10,791
Still, there must be
some records

25
00:01:10,875 --> 00:01:12,458
of what happened
that survived out there,

26
00:01:12,541 --> 00:01:13,708
waiting for someone
to find them.

27
00:01:13,791 --> 00:01:15,291
So, you're saying

28
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:17,083
if we went to this village
and looked around,

29
00:01:17,166 --> 00:01:19,416
we might find some way to end
the King's Game for good?

30
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,416
Yeah.

31
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,000
Well, sounds like a plan,

32
00:01:22,083 --> 00:01:23,166
let's get going then.

33
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:24,375
What?

34
00:01:24,458 --> 00:01:25,625
What? I'm not gonna let you

35

go alone and get hurt.

36
00:01:26,958 --> 00:01:28,666
You could definitely use
a little muscle

Um, if Kenta's going,
then I am, too!

40

I'm scared and don't want
to be alone right now.

41

Please, can I come, too?

Mm. Yeah, of course you can.

-Is that cool with you?
-Sure, I guess.

44
00:01:46,833 --> 00:01:48,250
We'll have to wait
for the morning trains

45
00:01:48,333 --> 00:01:49,500
before we can leave, though.

I've been meaning
to ask you all morning.

Are you really
gonna wear that?

You do realize we're going
to be hiking a mountain path.

Of course. That's why
I'm wearing these sneakers.

Did you find your old phone
to replace the broken one?

-I did, yeah.
-When we get better service,

if I switched to another phone,

You'll be just fine

that I'm not as brave
as the two of you.

I don't do anything,

I might die today.

I can't even stop shaking.

Tell me something.

Who do you think
is behind the King's Game,

During the last game,

was someone from my school.

You're pretty sure that the king
is someone in our class,

We can figure out who it is.

I'll find the King, and then
we'll put an end to all of this.

Do you really think
something like that might work?

everyone in class, one by one.

Eventually, I'll find him.

As soon as I put
my finger on the King,

we'll get the group text
saying that I obeyed the order.

Yeah, you make it sound
like you can't fail,

but aren't you forgetting
something really important?

the King's in our class, Nami,

before you thought the King

was in our class
and it makes total sense to me.

She has to touch the King
or she'll be punished.

145

She's gonna go
through the class list

-Mm.
-Hm.

159
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:56,666
Right, let's start
with the boys.

160
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:57,958
We'll go by the seating order.

161
00:07:58,041 --> 00:07:58,875
Shingo?

162
00:07:58,958 --> 00:08:00,583
I swear I'm not the King,

163
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:03,166
you can touch me all you want
to make sure, that's fine!

164
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:08,583
I don't want to believe
that someone in this room

165
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:10,125
is killing us.

166
00:08:10,208 --> 00:08:12,875
I can't imagine any of them
would be so cruel, but--

167
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:14,916
Well, here goes nothing.

168
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,875
Okay. Ready.

169
00:08:16,958 --> 00:08:18,666
[NOBUAKI]
We have to try to discover

170
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,666
the King's true identity.

171
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,708
It could be the only way
to survive.

172
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:34,416
Okay, Shingo's all clear.
We can mark his name off now.

173
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:38,291
-Just breathe, man.
-Hey, Nami. Still good?

174
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:41,041
Oh, yeah. Totally fine.
Only the girls are left?

175
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:43,916
[KEITA]
Told ya!

176
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
[NOBUAKI]
Only the girls are left?

177
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:48,125
Could the King
actually be a Queen?

178
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:51,458
No, more like a demon
wearing human skin.

179
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:53,958
Who are you?

180
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:55,958
Next is...

181
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:57,166
uh--

182
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,041
Ria. You're up next.

183
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:03,333
Will you put that down
and pay attention?

184
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:10,416
She's right, Ria.
Will you come up to the front?

185
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:14,625
I'm sorry. But you're definitely
the most suspicious girl.

186
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:16,250
You barely talk,
and you don't seem

187
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:18,708
to have any interest
in the rest of us.

188
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:20,958
But could you really
be behind this?

189
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:22,625
You couldn't be, right?

190
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:26,166
Otherwise you wouldn't be
so calm right now.

191
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:29,041
So, I'll try
and make it quick, okay?

192
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:40,125
[RIA]
Don't bother touching me,

193
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:42,333
I already know exactly
who the King is.

194
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,250
Because... I'm the person

195
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:47,416
who's been giving out
the orders.

196
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:01,458
You've betrayed your friends

197
00:10:01,541 --> 00:10:03,458
and did whatever it took
to stay alive

198
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:05,916
because that's exactly
what I asked of you.

199
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,791
The hell?
Are you being serious right now?

200
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:16,666
If I was the King,
what would all of you do?

201
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,875
Would everyone gang up on me?
Or maybe...

202
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:22,250
you'd try to convince me
to stop.

203
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:24,166
What's the point of all this?

204
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:25,958
You don't know
that finding the King

205
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:28,583
will actually end the game.

206
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:30,208
You're not even
one-hundred-percent certain

207
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:32,416
that the King
is someone in this classroom,

208
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,125
standing before you right now.

209
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:35,666
If the King's not
part of this class,

210
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,583
somebody else is gonna die.

211
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:39,083
Right, Nami?

212
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:41,541
I'm just saying what each
of you must've realized.

213
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:44,375
It's obvious that the only
guaranteed way to stop this game

214
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:46,541
is to kill the King
before he kills us.

215
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,791
You don't mean,
murdering him?

216
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:53,291
Yes. That's the fastest way
this game comes to an end.

217
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:55,791
We could never actually
murder someone.

218
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:57,708
So you started this
without ever thinking

219
00:10:57,791 --> 00:10:59,416
what you'd do
if you found him?

220
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,000
I'll tell you right now that
unless you take responsibility

221
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:04,958
and destroy him,
more people will end up dying.

222
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:07,125
Uh, we have to kill the King?

223
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:11,416
So, let's see
if I'm going to die.

224
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:18,750
Are you okay?
You're looking pretty pale, man.

225
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:19,916
Can you hear me?

226
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,458
Uh, I'm fine.

227
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:23,125
We didn't get
a new message.

228
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:25,666
Ria was just screwing with us,
she isn't the King.

229
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:32,458
[NOBUAKI]
Only five girls left to test.

230
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:36,166
Could one of them really be
the person behind this?

231
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:37,458
I'm scared.

232
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:39,375
Don't worry,
things are gonna work out.

233
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:41,166
We have to keep going.

234
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:43,708
We have to put a stop to this
before it's too late.

235
00:11:44,666 --> 00:11:47,000
-I'm up next on the class list.
-[gasps]

236
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:49,125
What's wrong?
Is everything okay?

237
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:52,125
Oh, yeah, of course,
I was just feeling lightheaded.

238
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:53,958
But if it turns out
the King isn't here,

239
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:55,333
then what will you do next?

240
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:57,458
I said I was fine, didn't I?

241
00:11:57,541 --> 00:11:59,875
One of you has to be
behind this horrible game.

242
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:01,375
Nobuaki thinks so, too!

243
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:03,583
[NOBUAKI]
I hope to God I'm right.

244
00:12:03,666 --> 00:12:07,208
I have absolutely no regrets
for the order I gave myself.

245
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:08,833
I'm saving us.

246
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:11,416
One of the five girls left
definitely has to be the King,

247
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,833
and I'll find her.

248
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:15,083
As far as I know,
it could even be you, Chiemi.

It's Chiemi? That can't be true!

252

Sorry.

253
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:31,708
This text was from someone else.

254
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:32,916
[sighs]

255
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,875
No. This can't be happening.

256
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:38,250
Why's there
no confirmation message?

257
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:43,625
Nobuaki. The King has to be
someone in our class, right?

258
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:45,125
[NAMI]
Come on, it's someone

259
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:46,833
in the room, isn't it?

260
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:51,083
She touched
every last one of us,

261
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:53,500
but no text from the King
ever came in.

262
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:54,875
So that must mean

263
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:56,833
the King was never
one of your classmates,

264
00:12:56,916 --> 00:12:58,833
but someone who was
on the outside.

265
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:01,125
Maybe. Or the King tricked us.

266
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:04,000
Crap, what do we do now?

267
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:05,541
She touched everyone, but--

268
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:07,916
No! She's going to be punished!

Don't worry about me, she
shouldn't be alone right now.

Just think a second,
where would she go?

If it were me,
I'd want to be alone.

Nobuaki,

292
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,708
I'm gonna die at midnight

293
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:17,875
and there's nothing
I can do to stop it.

294
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:19,750
There's no way
that's happening!

I bet the punishment
won't even be something bad.

I am not going to let you die.
I can promise you that.

That stupid order of mine
didn't even help anybody.

I'm sorry I ever started this.

You have nothing
to be sorry for.

You believed in my theory
when you didn't have to,

302
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,750
and you fought the King

to try to save
the rest of our classmates.

[phones ringing]

316
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:31,708
I've got less than
a minute left to live.

317
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:34,000
I'm going to die
without ever telling Nobuaki

318
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:35,500
how I feel about him.

319
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:39,333
Listen, the truth is,
I've been hiding something.

320
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:41,041
I-- I, um--

00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:42,708
Yeah?

322
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:46,916
You know what?
I still don't regret this.

the King's not in our class!

00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:56,791
Nobuaki?

327
00:15:56,875 --> 00:15:59,625
Is something happening to you?
Is anything hurting?

328
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:03,458
Where did you go?
No. No! I can't see anything.

329
00:16:03,541 --> 00:16:06,458
What's happening?
Everything just went black!

330
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:11,666
You really can't see me?
I'm sitting right next to you.

331
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:16,041
No! This is eternal darkness?

332
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,375
I've gone blind!

333
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:21,083
I couldn't find the King,
so he took away my eyes.

334
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:24,708
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

335
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:27,125
I'm the one to blame.

336
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:29,833
No you're not.
I'm only alive right now

337
00:16:29,916 --> 00:16:32,666
because I believed you when you
said I wouldn't die tonight.

-Nami. [gasps]

What more does this bastard
want me to lose?

341

[NAMI]
What is it?

342
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,333
Is it another order
from the King?

343
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:47,208
What does it say this time?

344
00:16:47,291 --> 00:16:49,791
Oh, this is nothing bad,
don't worry.

345
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:51,750
Please tell me it's not for you.

346
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:53,958
No not me. It's someone else.

[phone rings]

348
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,458
[NAMI] Who's calling?
Do you need to answer?

349
00:16:58,541 --> 00:17:00,416
It's probably Chiemi, right?

350
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,375
It's all good, I swear.

351
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:04,583
We have nothing to be afraid of.

352
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:09,583
[AKEMI]
Oh, thank goodness you answered.

353
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:10,583
Are you okay?

354
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:12,500
Yeah, I'm perfectly fine,

355
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:15,250
but I need a favor from you.
Will you please tell me

356
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:17,291
what the order that came in
for Nobuaki is?

357
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:18,333
[AKEMI]
Huh?

358
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,166
Nami!
Where is she?

359
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:27,375
Why the hell would she
just wander off right now?

360
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:29,333
She can't even see
where she's going!

361
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,250
[NOBUAKI]
Naoya! Have you seen Nami?

362
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:34,000
Not since earlier.

363
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:35,750
But, dude, what are you going to
do about this new King's order?

364
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:38,000
No one should be worried
about me right now!

365
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:40,000
Please help.
We have to find her!

366
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:41,791
What's going on?

367
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:46,375
She believed in what I thought.
Because of that she went blind.

368
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:48,791
Now she's all alone
out there somewhere.

369
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:52,458
[NAOYA] Okay. Don't panic.
I'll start looking for her now.

370
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:55,083
She couldn't have gone
all that far, right?

371
00:17:57,125 --> 00:18:01,583
Nami! Where are you?
Nami!

372
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:09,291
Please. You have to trust me.
Just one more time.

373
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:11,083
I'm begging you!

Uh, hello?

00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:17,791
Thank God. Where are you?
I've been freaking out.

377
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:20,791
Yeah. Sorry for disappearing
like that.

378
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:22,958
I didn't want to worry you

379
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:25,166
after everything
that you'd done for me.

380
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:27,041
[NOBUAKI] I've been looking
all over the place.

381
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:28,416
Where are you right now?

382
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:31,291
Will you answer something?

383
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:34,125
Please tell me the truth.
Am I someone important to you?

384
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:35,583
You have to ask?

385
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:37,958
Do you have any idea
how worried I've been today?

386
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:40,625
I asked Akemi about
the order that came in.

387
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:43,166
It really was for you.

388
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:45,333
I guess you didn't want me
to be concerned about it.

389
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:46,833
Oh.

390
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:50,166
I've been trying to figure out
what it might mean.

391
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:52,833
Do you think my life
would maybe count

392
00:18:52,916 --> 00:18:54,333
as something important to you?

393
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:56,750
What?
Don't you even joke about that!

394
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:58,916
I'm just going to break
something I like at my house,

395
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,500
and I'm sure it'll count.

396
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:03,500
Being blind is so hard.

397
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:05,958
I had no idea
it'd be so dark.

398
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:09,125
And I'm too scared to go
any further in the King's Game.

399
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:10,958
I can't do it.

400
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:13,083
Then let me be
your new eyes, Nami.

401
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:14,583
We can get through
this together,

402
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:16,916
I promise I'll protect you
from this stupid game!

403
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Trust me!

404
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:19,875
I wanted to tell you,

405
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:22,791
but then I got too shy
before the words came out.

406
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:25,000
It's probably best
if you don't know.

407

saying I did it?

You don't need
to worry about me.

417
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:01,958
I was smashing everything I had,
and suddenly the King texted

418
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:04,958
and said that I'd obeyed him,
so it's all good.

We made out and I touched her
