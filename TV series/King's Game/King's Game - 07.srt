1
00:00:15,208 --> 00:00:16,208
You think that's it?

2
00:00:17,375 --> 00:00:20,875
[bird shrieking]

3
00:00:26,875 --> 00:00:29,958
[NOBUAKI] After all this time,
I'm finally here.

4
00:00:30,958 --> 00:00:32,208
Yonaki Village.

5
00:00:35,083 --> 00:00:36,625
We can squeeze
through that hole.

6
00:00:40,416 --> 00:00:42,208
[footsteps]

7
00:00:47,458 --> 00:00:48,416
[KENTA]
No signal.

8
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:52,791
That's so loud. What is it?

9
00:00:52,875 --> 00:00:53,916
Nothing, just the wind.

10
00:00:54,875 --> 00:00:56,083
This isn't good.

11
00:00:56,166 --> 00:00:57,166
What's wrong?

12
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:59,291
Mizuki still has
to send two texts

13
00:00:59,375 --> 00:01:00,583
telling people to die tonight.

14
00:01:00,666 --> 00:01:02,083
So what are we gonna do?

15
00:01:03,208 --> 00:01:05,583
We should have her send
the texts to Natsuko and Haruka.

16
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:06,708
Uh?

17
00:01:09,166 --> 00:01:10,666
[NOBUAKI]
Natsuko's been acting crazy,

18
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:12,791
so she's bound
to become a problem.

19
00:01:12,875 --> 00:01:15,458
Haruka's order was to let
Tsubasa touch her chest,

20
00:01:15,541 --> 00:01:16,583
but...

21
00:01:17,708 --> 00:01:20,875
Well, he's already dead,
so that's impossible.

22
00:01:20,958 --> 00:01:22,541
Haruka can't be saved.

23
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:25,708
It makes the most sense
to choose those two.

24
00:01:25,791 --> 00:01:27,458
At least that way
we can save Mizuki.

25
00:01:29,166 --> 00:01:30,708
I know things have gone crazy.

26
00:01:30,791 --> 00:01:33,125
But who are we to say
whose life matters most?

27
00:01:33,208 --> 00:01:35,041
So you don't think
a baby deserves

28
00:01:35,125 --> 00:01:36,666
to live more
than a dying old person?

29
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,500
A life is a life, Nobuaki.

30
00:01:38,583 --> 00:01:41,458
If you keep thinking that way,
you won't make it out of this.

31
00:01:42,791 --> 00:01:45,000
-[MIZUKI] Hey, guys.
-[BOTH] Uh?

32
00:01:45,083 --> 00:01:46,583
[MIZUKI]
I think we're here.

33
00:01:46,666 --> 00:01:49,083
I can see something
on the other side of the tunnel.

34
00:01:50,083 --> 00:01:52,000
This is it.
I wonder how long it's been

35
00:01:52,083 --> 00:01:54,500
since anyone set foot
in this place.

36
00:01:54,583 --> 00:01:57,000
The locals must know
this village is cursed.

37
00:01:57,083 --> 00:01:58,541
[wind howling]

38
00:03:29,666 --> 00:03:33,041
[cawing]

39
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:40,250
Wait. Why is it
so dark out here?

40
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:43,125
I mean, the sun
should still be out.

41
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:57,125
Whoa.

42
00:03:57,208 --> 00:03:59,458
[KENTA]
This is the place, right?

43
00:03:59,541 --> 00:04:00,416
[NOBUAKI]
Yeah.

44
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:02,666
It's Yonaki Village

45
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:07,375
[cawing]

46
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:15,541
Okay. So, uh,
what should we check out first?

47
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:17,625
I don't know,
but there must be a clue

48
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:19,583
about the King's Game
here somewhere.

49
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:23,166
Honda?

50
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:28,458
Hey, wait, Nobuaki!

51
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:31,375
You sure it's okay to go in?

52
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:35,541
I have to look.

53
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:37,875
If anything weird happens,
just yell.

54
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:39,833
Mizuki and I'll watch
things out here.

55
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:47,916
Uh?

56
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:03,583
Is that Chiemi and her father?

57
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:05,458
What in the hell is this place?

58
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:17,416
This looks just like them,
but how can that be?

59
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:25,250
[NOBUAKI] "I'm coming
to apologize to you, Chiemi."

60
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:28,416
What the hell does that mean?

61
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,375
Is her dad connected
to the game?

62
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:32,875
[KENTA]
Mizuki? Where'd you go?

63
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:37,333
Hey, Mizuki!

64
00:05:37,416 --> 00:05:40,000
Where are you? Can you hear me?

65
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:43,750
[KENTA]
I'm such an idiot.

66
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:45,416
I was too distracted
by that house.

67
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,625
[phone beeps]

68
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:47,583
Hold on.

69
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:49,833
A text?

70
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:51,791
But I shouldn't have
a signal way out here.

71
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:09,041
No. The King killed
seven people all at once?

72
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:12,750
You bastard!
Screw your punishments!

73
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:15,458
You won't get away with it!
Do you hear me!

74
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:21,000
What do I do?

75
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:23,291
Go back and regroup
with Nobuaki?

76
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:25,000
But what if Mizuki needs me?

77
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:27,625
Think. Come on!

78
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:30,125
Who's there?

79
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:34,000
Mizuki.

80
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:38,916
I just came back
to say goodbye.

81
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:43,500
Hey, guys.
Where'd you go?

82
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:03,000
What is this?

83
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:18,291
[flies buzzing]

84
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:28,333
Oh, my god!

85
00:07:36,416 --> 00:07:37,916
The man looks
a lot younger here,

86
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,125
but I think this is
Chiemi's dad.

87
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:42,416
Okay.

88
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,041
So did he kill himself
or what?

89
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:50,375
But why?
What was he apologizing for?

90
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:54,500
Is it because he dragged
Chiemi into the game?

91
00:07:58,083 --> 00:07:59,875
Or maybe he was part
of the very first one

92
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:02,041
that ended up
destroying this village.

93
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:04,250
And then when it started
happening to Chiemi.

94
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:05,958
He might have thought
it was his fault,

95
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:07,125
and then committed suicide

96
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:08,666
because of his guilt
or something.

97
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:14,958
Wait. "Daughters"?
Chiemi had a sister?

98
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:19,333
Natsuko?

99
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,500
Wait, what? They're related?

100
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,708
-No way.
-Welcome to the back.

101
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:27,125
My name's Honda Natsuko.
Nice to meet you.

102
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:31,166
And here I was hoping you'd have
some sort of good advice

103
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:34,041
since you played this
stupid game before and survived.

104
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:37,291
[NOBUAKI] If Chiemi
and Natusko are sisters, then...

105
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,458
Ugh!

106
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:40,833
Could you be more annoying?
Face it.

107
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:44,916
Every animal puts its own
survival above everything else.

108
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
You can't hesitate or be afraid
to betray your closest friend

109
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:50,041
to save yourself.
You know that.

110
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:52,791
After all, you survived, right?
Who'd you kill?

111
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:58,333
Does that mean...

112
00:08:58,416 --> 00:09:00,833
Natsuko survived
a King's Game before, too?

113
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,208
What in the world
are you talking about?

114
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:20,041
There's no need for you
to say goodbye.

115
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:22,250
I hear that love found
during a tragedy

116
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:23,833
won't lead to anything.

117
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:26,083
It just disappears,
like a dream.

118
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:28,500
I figured out what to do
with my order.

119
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:31,958
Did you know that it's possible
to send a text to yourself?

120
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:34,500
I really want
to protect you, Kenta.

121
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:36,666
I don't want to hurt anyone,

122
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,291
so I'll message myself

123
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:40,500
and send the other text
to Natsuko.

124
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:42,166
I really don't trust her.

125
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,333
She was acting suspicious
back at the park.

126
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:46,125
And then she...
She tried to force me

127
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:47,291
to murder you!

128
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:50,500
[KENTA]
Mizuki. Please, don't.

129
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:51,625
Listen, Kenta.

130
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:53,208
I know it's not for real.

131
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:56,416
But, um, will you call me cute?

132
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,875
Or tell me you think
I'm beautiful?

133
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:00,333
It'd mean a lot to me.

134
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,125
What are you talking about?

135
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:05,833
You can't just ask me
to say that.

136
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:08,750
And you probably don't wanna
lie to me, do you?

137
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:09,750
Never mind.

138
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,916
I always did like
your honesty, Kenta.

139
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:17,958
And... Well, actually,
I like everything about you.

140
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:20,666
Is it possible that you might
feel the same way about me?

141
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:26,125
Uh, well, I... I guess.

142
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:28,625
I can't say it!

143
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:31,041
[sobbing]

144
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:32,375
Stupid me.

145
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:35,208
I just had to go
and make things awkward.

146
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:37,791
I'm sorry. Goodbye!

147
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:39,916
-Wait!
-[MIZUKI crying]

148
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:43,291
[KENTA] You didn't give me
a chance to answer you!

149
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:45,000
[MIZUKI]
You didn't have to say anything.

150
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:48,666
I've said what I wanted.
Let's just leave it at that.

151
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:51,500
Please forgive me
for being so selfish!

152
00:10:56,833 --> 00:11:00,166
Don't. You can't stop me.
It's late.

153
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:02,916
I have to find a signal
so I can send these texts.

154
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,125
Let me go!

155
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:06,000
Not yet. Stay.

156
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:13,041
[MIZUKI] It's not fair
to hold me like that.

157
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:15,041
You're stronger than me.

158
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:17,083
Don't make me scream for help.

159
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:20,208
[KENTA] But what if the love
found in this tragedy

160
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:21,666
could actually last?

161
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:24,500
What do you mean by that?

162
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:26,166
You better not be
playing around with me,

163
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,666
or I'll take it the wrong way.

164

Let me show you.

165
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:47,333
I'm so happy.

166
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:49,250
Kenta. I love you.

167
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:54,250
And now I can tell you
what I really want to happen.

168
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:56,125
Okay?

169
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:57,958
Yeah, of course.

170
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:01,375
I want you to die
with me, Kenta.

171
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:07,125
This game has nothing
but pain ahead for us.

172
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:08,958
But I can make sure
that you and I

173
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:10,583
never have to suffer again.

174
00:12:11,541 --> 00:12:12,708
You don't mean...

175

[MIZUKI]
You have to remember.

176
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:16,333
If I die, then you die, too.

177
00:12:16,416 --> 00:12:19,166
No matter what,
you'll follow me in death.

178
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,083
We'll go together hand-in-hand.

179
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:22,416
No. Hold on.

180
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,125
I can't think of anything
more romantic.

181

Right?
It's just so perfect!

182

What you're saying is crazy.
Snap out of it!

183
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,708
If we die together,
then our love will be eternal

184
00:12:32,791 --> 00:12:34,333
and nothing will break us apart.

185
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:38,666
You're wrong, Mizuki.
I won't let either of us die.

186
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,041
You're not yourself.

00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:46,041
If you feel the same way
I do about you,

189
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:47,250
then show me.

190
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:51,166
[KENTA] That isn't the way
to prove my feelings.

191
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:53,166
If you die, then everything
we've gone through

192
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:54,250
will have been for nothing.

193
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:56,541
No, that's not true.

194
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:58,125
[KENTA]
This would all be over.

195
00:12:58,208 --> 00:12:59,500
No more happiness.

196
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:01,291
You only get to have
the lasting love

197
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:02,958
if you're alive,
don't you get that?

198
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:04,250
Open your eyes!

199
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:08,458
[MIZUKI] I'd hoped my feelings
would get through to you.

But you don't understand.

I have to go.

202
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:14,458
I'll find a place
with a signal.

203
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:17,375
Then I'll send the "die" texts
to myself and Natsuko.

204
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:19,041
-No.
-I love you.

But it's for the best.

A few minutes to spare.

209
00:13:56,375 --> 00:13:59,416
[KENTA] There, that should count
as Mizuki sending the text.

210
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,541
You've gotta live
for the both of us now.

Two new messages.

The one from Mizuki.

215

And one from the King.
Obedience confirmed.

216
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:24,208
Maybe that means
I followed through

217
00:14:24,291 --> 00:14:26,208
on the order I gave myself
to protect Mizuki.

218
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:30,125
All right then.
You're going to be okay.

219

Nobuaki will be upset.

220

But I hope he'll understand
why I did this.

It's all up to him now.

I have to find them

and get out of this village
before midnight.

Is that a cell tower?

[KENTA]
No signal.

226
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:54,666
I bet they went there
so Mizuki could get a signal

227

for her phone.

228
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,625
So she could text Natsuko--

00:21:15,916 --> 00:21:17,208
You gave me hope.

324
00:21:19,791 --> 00:21:22,375
I learned so much from you both.
Seriously.

325
00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:25,416
But I still want
to know one thing.

326
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:29,333
Tell me, Kenta.

327
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:34,916
Was the sacrifice
you made worth it?

328
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:45,416

329
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,083
Who has my phone?

Hi there, Nobu, babe!

331
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:05,541
So, are Kenta and Mizuki
still alive?

332
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:07,708
Or did they die in front of you?

333
00:22:09,708 --> 00:22:10,958
Natsuko!
