1
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,375
[RIA] I'm honestly impressed
you didn't cry.

2
00:00:22,958 --> 00:00:24,333
Ria.

3
00:00:24,416 --> 00:00:28,041
I mean, not that I'd care
if you were murdered.

4
00:00:28,125 --> 00:00:32,333
But since you're still alive,
you can tell me something.

5
00:00:32,416 --> 00:00:34,333
I don't have anything
to say to you.

6
00:00:34,416 --> 00:00:36,416
Yousuke was
researching the game.

7
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,416
I want to know
what he found out.

8
00:02:17,916 --> 00:02:21,708
I switched my number over.
Do you think it'll be okay?

9
00:02:21,791 --> 00:02:24,541
Yeah, as long as you can still
get texts from the King,

10
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:26,500
he has no reason to punish you.

11
00:02:26,583 --> 00:02:28,291
Well now that
that's out of the way.

12
00:02:28,375 --> 00:02:30,458
We should probably head out
to Yonaki Village.

13
00:02:30,541 --> 00:02:32,375
Right.

14
00:02:35,875 --> 00:02:38,208
[KENTA] This story's so crazy
and hard to believe.

15
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:39,375
But it's all true?

16
00:02:39,458 --> 00:02:41,000
Yeah.

17
00:02:41,083 --> 00:02:43,375
I can't imagine
how painful that was.

18
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:47,083
I only made it through
because Chiemi was there.

19
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:49,333
She meant
the entire world to me.

20
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:52,125
She was your rock
through it all, huh?

21
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:57,916
Things probably got even worse
in your last game,

22
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,625
but will you tell us about it?

23
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:01,500
If it's something
that could happen to us,

24
00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:03,333
we need to be prepared for it.

25
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:07,416
Yeah, sure. You should know
how bad this could get.

26
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:16,750
[OPERATOR]
The phone you have dialed

27
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:17,875
is out of the service area

28
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:19,416
or is no longer in service.

29
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,333
Please make sure
you have the correct number,

30
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:22,583
and then try again later.

31
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:23,958
Damn!

32
00:03:24,958 --> 00:03:28,291
Come on, man.
You better be okay.

33
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,791
-[phone ringing]
-Huh?

34
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:32,791
Hey, Nobuaki, is that you?

35
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:33,916
[ABE]
Huh?

36
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,750
No stupid. It's me, Toshiyuki.

37
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:38,750
[NAOYA]
Uh, what is it?

38
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:41,291
We need to figure out what we
should do about today's order.

39
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:45,666
[NAOYA]
Uh, well... I don't know.

40
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,041
If we screw this up,

41
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:49,291
every single one of us
is gonna end up dead!

42
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:50,666
I know it's called a game,

43
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,708
but this new command
is freakin' ridiculous.

44
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:55,541
You saw it right?
One of us has to roll a die,

45
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:57,333
and then name
that amount of people.

46
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:58,958
Then everyone
who gets called out

47
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:01,625
is punished along with the
poor bastard that has to roll!

48
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:03,208
I mean, what the hell?

49
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:06,208
And if we don't play along,
we're still screwed! Argh!

50
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:08,708
I wanna kill this psycho!

51
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:11,083
So, what's the plan, smart guy?

52
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:12,791
Who the hell is gonna roll?

53
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:14,666
[NAOYA]
Um, maybe--

54
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,791
If Nobuaki were here,

55
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:18,833
I bet he'd know what to do.

56
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:20,708
Just give me some time to think.

57
00:04:20,791 --> 00:04:22,583
[line clicks]

58
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:24,166
Huh?

59
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:29,541
I don't care what we have to do.
You and I are gonna survive.

60
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:30,916
Yeah, definitely.

61
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,083
There are only ten
of us left alive.

62
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:35,666
Worst case scenario,
someone rolls a six,

63
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:38,583
which means only three of us end
up making it through the night.

64
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:41,500
Those are some
really crappy odds.

65
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:43,958
And whoever rolls,
picks who dies.

66
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:45,666
I can't let Chia do it.

67
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:48,791
Not only is she a real bitch,
she totally hates me, too.

68
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:52,166
I bet she'd pull every dirty
trick imaginable to win this.

69
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,833
I'm not able to talk
to Nobuaki right now,

70
00:04:57,916 --> 00:05:00,041
but I know he'd want me
to protect Chiemi.

71
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:04,833
[phone chimes]

72
00:05:12,541 --> 00:05:14,416
The park?

73
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:25,708
Yeah, of course.
Sure. I understand.

74
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:28,708
Thanks for letting me know.

75
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:32,083
Please send her my best.

00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:36,500
Masami.
She's in the hospital.

Tried to kill herself
and slit her wrists.

78
00:05:38,916 --> 00:05:39,916
Huh?

[ALL gasp]

80
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:42,375
Hey!

81
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:45,250
Why the hell haven't
Nobuaki and Ria shown up?

82
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:49,416
We have a decision
to make here, dammit.

83
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,541
Come on, which of you guys
is gonna roll the die?

84
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:54,333
It's like Nobuaki said,

85
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:56,291
we need to trust each other
and work together

86
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:58,416
if we really want
to take down the King.

87
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:02,250
I agree with her.

88
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:03,333
Huh?

89
00:06:03,416 --> 00:06:05,083
If we put our brains together,

90
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:06,458
maybe we can end this.

91
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:08,625
But we all have to believe
in each other.

92
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:12,875
Sure, great idea, Keita,
That's what we'll do. No sweat.

93
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:15,916
So, then.
Why don't you go ahead and roll?

94
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,500
Come on, I believe in you.

95
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:24,333
I don't know why
you're in such a hurry.

96
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:26,791
You know everybody in class
hates you, right?

97
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:29,375
I mean, your little pet over
there might save you.

98
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:32,125
Not because he likes you,
because he's terrified of you,

99
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:33,625
But the rest of us

100
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:35,541
are sure to name you first
if we're the one to roll.

101
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:37,041
Say what?

102
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:38,583
No one cares what you think!

103
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:41,541
'Cause you're the one everyone
hates, you ugly whore.

What? I'm the ugly one?

You look like a boxer that's
taken too many to the face.

Sorry, I hope
you weren't worried.

I was fine.
I promise.

114
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:16,041
I knew you were out there
trying to help us.

115
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:24,333
All right, Ria, what gives?
You called us out here,

116
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:26,458
so where do you get off
being the late one?

117

The more people who are here,

the less likely I am
to have to roll this damn thing

121

or get my name called.

You know deep down inside
you're just as relieved as I am.

Don't be an idiot!

-Quit it!
-Ha! Hey, don't blame me,

127
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:51,041
your buddy here is the one
who threw the first punch.

I wanna do in my life
to die right now.

I am not gonna let
this game kill me!

But if we work together,
then maybe we can--

We're best friends, aren't we?

If you roll the die right now,
you can save me.

call my name first.

me from being punished here.

a chance to win this.

161
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:22,166
-What are you doing? Hold still.
-Please!

162
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:24,083
If you don't shut up and stop
struggling, I'll stab you.

163
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:25,666
-[MINAKO] Stop it!
-No, don't!

164
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,791
No one move
or I swear I'll kill her!

165
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:30,000
Oh, please, don't be stupid.

166
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:31,916
We all know you're way
too much of a coward

167
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,666
to actually
go through with this.

168
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,125
You just watch me!

169
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:38,958
[screams]

170
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:40,208
[laughs]

171
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:41,750
Chiemi!

172
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:44,000
I told you
not to move, loverboy!

173
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:46,500
Listen up,

174
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:48,083
I'm the one who's giving
the orders from now on,

175
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:49,333
not the King.

176
00:09:49,416 --> 00:09:51,583
So. If you try anything
I'll kill her.

177
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:54,125
I am not playing
around here! Got it?

178
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:58,125
Now let's get started.
Nobuaki, Naoya.

179
00:09:58,208 --> 00:10:00,583
I want one of you
to roll the die.

180
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:04,250
If I'm the one who does this,
I'll be punished.

181
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:06,666
But if I don't,
he's gonna hurt Chiemi.

182
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,750
[NOBUAKI]
I'll do it.

183
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:10,500
Just get your hands off her!

184
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:11,916
You don't have to!

185
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,791
Ha! I'm not letting her go
until this is over.

186
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:17,166
So hurry up
and get on with it.

187
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:20,375
It's all right.
Give the die to me.

188
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:30,750
-What are you doing?
-We need you to stay alive.

189
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:32,208
To protect Chiemi.

190
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:34,458
And I know you can
take down the King.

191
00:10:34,541 --> 00:10:36,750
You two are the reason
I'm still here.

192
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:38,416
So if this means
you'll both survive,

193
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,750
then I'm happy
to roll the die, really.

194
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,666
Don't do it, Naoya!

195
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:50,750
[laughs]

196
00:10:57,916 --> 00:11:00,541
[phone beeping]

197
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:03,625
It says I have ten minutes

198
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:05,833
to pick the number
of classmates that I rolled.

199
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:07,375
So that's six of them.

200
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:10,958
If I say their name,
they'll be punished.

201
00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:30,125
Hurry up. Pick anyone,
just as long as it's not me.

202
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:32,541
I'd recommend Chia or Minako.

203
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:35,625
Hell, you could even say
Chiemi's name for all I care.

204
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:39,750
Naoya, um, name Masami.
She isn't here

205
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:41,416
and she tried to kill herself.

206
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,375
Dammit, it's not that simple.

207
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:45,750
People's lives are
in my hands, Keita!

208
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:48,250
-[phones ringing]
-[ALL gasp]

209
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:54,666
No. Me?

210
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,583
Oh, my God.

211
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:58,416
I can't say any names at all.

212
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,750
But I was just trying to help.

213
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:02,500
Not me. [crying]

214
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:04,166
I'm sorry!

215
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:07,041
I didn't mean to, I promise,
it was an accident, I swear.

216
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:08,750
You idiot!

217
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:13,541
My neck hurts.

218
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:17,583
[groaning]

219
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:29,166
I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!

220
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:34,208
Hey. It's fixed.
Right?

221
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:43,916
Oh no!

Oh, my god.

225
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:04,416
Things had
gotten so extreme.

226
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,333
So many of us had died.

227
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:08,708
Our friendships had all been
pushed to the limits.

228
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:10,375
But still,

229
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:13,208
whatever was behind it
all wasn't satisfied.

230
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:19,791
[gasps]

231

[coughs]

232
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:33,291
Masami, the girl
in the hospital,

233
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:34,791
was the next to be named.

234
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:38,208
Naoya eventually gave in
to Toshiyuki's threats.

235
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:42,541
He called out Chia and Minako.
They died in front of us.

236
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:45,916
And Naoya still had to name
two more people.

237
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,583
Otherwise, we'd all be punished.

238
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:53,083
We're running out of time.

239
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,916
-Say Nobuaki next!
-Naoya!

240
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,791
Please, you have to say
my name instead, not his.

241
00:13:58,875 --> 00:14:01,875
Punish me. It's okay.

242
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:04,125
Don't listen to her.

243
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:06,750
Say my name.
Save Chiemi no matter what.

244
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:08,791
I can't kill you.

Open your eyes already, moron!

Do you even understand
what you're doing to us?

250
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:26,333
I don't think you get it.

251
00:14:26,416 --> 00:14:28,583
We have to look out
for ourselves in this.

252
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:30,750
I can't take it anymore.

253
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:33,916
Naoya, you have to call
my name next and then his.

254
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,083
Do it. End this right now!

255
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:39,166
Naoya! Name us!

256
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:42,875
Are you sure?

257
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:44,333
Don't you dare!

Chiemi. Are you okay?

263
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:13,000
Nobuaki, I hate this!

264
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:22,666
He needs you right now
so go be with him.

265
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:28,125
Tell me what can I do.

266
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:31,416
It's too late for me.
I'm gonna die next.

267
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:38,750
But, you know what?
At least if I have to die,

268
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:40,666
I got to do it saving
the two of you.

269
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,500
I'm honestly glad.

270
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:49,916
What's happening?

271
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,291
My arm, it-- it hurts.

272
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:54,500
It hurts!

being there for me.

I love you both so much.

277
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I want you to survive.

278
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:16,583
Destroy the king.

279
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:18,166
You have to.

280
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:21,666
I know you can.
I believe in you.

No! No, Naoya.
Talk to me! Naoya!

Hey, Nobuaki.

285
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:44,333
Let me ask you something.
What do you think heaven's like?

286
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:51,083
Must be an amazing place, yeah?

287
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:55,375
[NAOYA]
Because everyone stays there.

288
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:57,208
Nobody ever comes back.

289
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:05,958
Naoya? Don't go.

00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:09,500

[phone chimes]

292
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,791
Stop it.
What do you think you're doing?

293
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:25,250
I thought that'd be obvious.

294
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:27,916
I'm going to take down
the King right now.

295
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,791
There won't be any more orders.

296
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:32,291
Mm. Is that really possible?

297
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:41,750
Since the first text,

298
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:43,708
I've been looking
into the King's Game,

299
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:46,375
but I couldn't find out
everything on my own.

300
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:49,250
Luckily, I was able to get
closer to what's behind this,

301
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:52,041
--by adding what Yousuke
sent you to my own research.

302
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:55,458
It started over
30 years ago.

303
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,583
There was a series
of unexplainable deaths

304
00:17:57,666 --> 00:17:59,333
in a place called
Yonaki Village.

305
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:02,541
I think that was
the very first King's Game.

306
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:04,333
It was before cell phones,
obviously,

307
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,708
so the orders were delivered
to the players on paper,

308
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:08,458
all signed by the King.

309
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:12,291
Pretty soon the villagers
started dropping like flies.

310
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:14,208
No one could understand why.

311
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:16,416
You can imagine
this caused an uproar.

312
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,166
But the police
and the public officials

313
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:19,791
couldn't figure out
how to stop it.

314
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:23,416
Afterwards, though,
some scientists theorized

315
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:26,000
that the game might not have
been started by a person,

316
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:27,166
but a virus.

317
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:28,666
A virus?

318
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,791
Yes, they believed
the mysterious deaths

319
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:32,500
were actually caused
by a virus

320
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:35,208
that sent powerful suggestions
to people's brains.

321
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:38,208
I don't understand.
What are you saying?

322
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:41,666
Hypnotized people can injure
themselves with just a thought.

323
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,458
They can make lesions
appear on their skin

324
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:45,291
without ever being touched.

325
00:18:47,541 --> 00:18:49,333
You see,
when the human body receives

326
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:51,750
a powerful enough cue
or suggestion,

327
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:54,125
it can actually
destroy its own cells.

328
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:55,375
It's likely the King's Game

329
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:57,333
takes this phenomenon
to the extreme.

330
00:18:58,416 --> 00:19:00,125
Hold on a second.

331
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:03,416
If that's true, how did we get
this "virus" in the first place?

332
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,000
It's not like it came
from a text message?

333
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:08,208
According to at least
one theory,

334
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:10,750
the suggestions are like
a type of infectious disease

335
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:12,291
that can spread.

336
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:15,458
The virus born in Yonaki Village
was never eradicated.

337
00:19:15,541 --> 00:19:18,500
As communication networks
and the internet evolved,

338
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:20,333
it began to move
through them freely.

339
00:19:20,416 --> 00:19:23,291
It, too, grew and changed.
To this day,

340
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:26,125
the virus continues to spread
through our cell phones.

341
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:27,958
Wait, is that even possible?

342
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:29,791
Another thing,

343
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:31,791
everyone who's killed
in the game receives

344
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:33,583
a one-syllable
text from the King

345
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:35,583
right before they get punished.

346
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,791
Unfortunately, I wasn't able
to form any kind of sentence

347
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:41,458
that made sense
based on the texts

348
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:43,250
that Yousuke and I compiled.

349
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:46,000
But I was able to complete
an anti-virus

350
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:48,041
that should eradicate
the King's Game.

351
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:50,875
I found a fatal bug
hidden in its programming.

352
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:52,416
With a few keystrokes,

353
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,958
I can get rid of every trace
of it on the network.

354
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:58,166
Ria, who are you, exactly?

355
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:02,375
My father was smart.

356
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:04,791
A genius when it came
to computer programming.

357
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:07,458
But...

358
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:09,083
that doesn't matter, really.

359
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,541
I'm starting the program.

360
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:45,958
The King's Game virus
has been deleted.

361
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:48,375
Feels kind of anticlimactic.

362
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:50,791
Is it really over?

363
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:53,041
-[computer beeps]
-[ALL gasp]

364
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:02,416
[NOBUAKI]
Oh god. No!

365
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,791
I see.

366
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:07,000
So the bug itself
was a trap set by the King.

367
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:10,208
Ria!

368
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:13,958
Well, I hate to admit it,
but it looks like

369
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:16,541
I'm not gonna be the winner
of the King's Game after all.

370
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:29,041
Ria.

371
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:31,958
I'm sure you've heard
the rumors about me, right?

372
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:34,291
That I was abused
by the father I once

373
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:37,291
looked up to more than anything.

374
00:21:37,375 --> 00:21:40,375
Practically every day of my life
was a living hell.

375
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:43,250
At least until
he finally killed himself.

376
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:45,958
For a while, I was sure
I'd lost the will to live.

377
00:21:46,916 --> 00:21:49,125
But this game made me
feel something again.

378
00:21:51,916 --> 00:21:54,250
I'd been drifting
through life aimlessly.

379
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:55,958
But then, suddenly,

380
00:21:56,041 --> 00:21:58,125
the King's Game
gave me a purpose.

381
00:21:59,083 --> 00:22:00,291
Ria!

382
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:01,791
It's not that I wanted

383
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:03,875
to keep living,
not entirely.

384
00:22:03,958 --> 00:22:07,750
I just wanted to win is all.

385
00:22:07,833 --> 00:22:11,125
Because there's no point in
playing a game unless you win.

386
00:22:16,708 --> 00:22:20,291
Nobuaki, you were my insurance.

387
00:22:20,375 --> 00:22:21,583
Understand?

388
00:22:23,791 --> 00:22:26,125
Just in case I didn't
manage to survive.

389
00:22:28,458 --> 00:22:33,791
Nobuaki, Chiemi, the two of you
have to finish off

390
00:22:33,875 --> 00:22:35,625
this bastard King in my place.

391
00:22:43,791 --> 00:22:45,125
[BOTH]
Ria!

392
00:23:27,958 --> 00:23:30,958
I see something,
you think that's it?

393
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:44,625
After all this time,
I'm finally here.

394
00:23:44,708 --> 00:23:47,041
Yonaki Village.
