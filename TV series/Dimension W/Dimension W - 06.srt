Well, this is a

I never expected you would
bring someone with you.

Now, ladies,
don't just stand there.

Uh, what kind of store is this?

It's a clothing store.
We mainly sell kimonos.

Do you have samurai
outfits, too?

Thank you, Tsubaki.

it's better than nothing.

[TSUBAKI]
Here. Give it a try.

228
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,625
The fabric is heavy,
but I tried

229
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:34,500
to lighten the lining a bit.
So, what do you think?

230
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,541
It's well made. Sturdy,
but lighter than it looks,

231
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:43,958
which'll be good for fighting.

232
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:45,333
I'm glad to hear it!

233
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:47,666
If you died in a fight
because of something I made,

234
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:50,166
I don't know how I would
ever sleep at night!

my best not to die

never take it off.

I refuse to let you die before
I do, Kyoma, and that's final.

Isn't it time for you
to forgive yourself?

I've been using
the loss of my memories

250
00:13:26,416 --> 00:13:29,666
as an excuse to run away
or bury my head.

251
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:34,250
The truth is, I don't even
know what I left behind.

And, well,

253
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:38,375
that makes forgiveness and
acceptance difficult to find.

wrong with this outfit.

really wear this?

00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:23,041
I'm Tsubaki Azumaya and
I am the owner of this shop,

318
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:24,250
My name is Hirose!

319
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:25,625
I'm Ayukawa.

320
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:28,458
[MIRA] Oh, hello!
Nice to meet you both!

321
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:30,791
Now, then, it's time
for you to tell me

322
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:32,375
how you know this young woman,

323
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:35,958
I'm dying to hear this, Kyoma,
and don't leave anything out.

324
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:37,041
[KYOMA grunts]

325
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:40,958
[KYOMA] Did you have
to show up like that?

326
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:42,000
[MIRA]
What else could I do?

327
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:43,875
Mary wanted to know
where you were.

328
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:45,083
[KYOMA groans]

329
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:47,750
I like Tsubaki.
She seems really nice.

330
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:50,625
It was very kind of her
to give me this yukata.

331
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:52,708
I just wish she
wasn't so persistent.

332
00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:53,541
[boom]

333
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:54,791
[gasps]

334
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:57,291
--[CROWD gasping]
--[MIRA] Fireworks!

335
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:03,083
[SALVA]
Did you enjoy Japan, Lwai?

336
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:06,333
[LWAI]
Yes, very much.

337
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:10,208
[SALVA] Well, that's good,
because the fun is over now.

338
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:13,375
We have fireworks of
our own to set off.

339
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:17,083
[doorbell ringing]

340
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:20,875
What the hell? Visitors? Now?

341
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,833
Stop there! Identify yourself!

342
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:37,166
[LWAI exhales]

343
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:02,583
[LOSER] This isn't one
of the Numbers, either.

344
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:06,875
Just one more! That's all I
need, and it will be complete!

345
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:10,208
[sighs] I hate to say it,
but maybe we should've

346
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:13,208
tried a little harder to get
the one from Yasogami.

347
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:15,750
[LOSER] Don't blame me.
Blame the Beasts of Grendel.

348
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:18,791
Are they really that strong?
Or is it just hype?

349
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:20,750
[LOSER]
No. They're strong.

350
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:23,708
Their actions in the last
war made them legendary.

351
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:25,000
[ELIZABETH]
Couldn't we just modify

352
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:27,166
an illegal coil
for what we need?

353
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:29,791
[LOSER] Not with the current
equipment, we can't.

354
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:31,833
Yeah, I thought you
were gonna say that.

355
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:32,875
[gasps]

356
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:35,833
Hey, Papa.

357
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:38,958
It looks like something's
just happened in Central 47.

358
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:40,458
[KOOROGI] How dare they!
How dare they!

359
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:42,166
How dare they! How dare
they! How dare they!

360
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:45,083
How dare they! How dare
they! How dare they!

361
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,958
And all it took was one hit.

362
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:49,916
[MIRA gasps]

363
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,125
[KYOMA]
Four's body is military grade.

364
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:53,791
Did they have an illegal coil?

365
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:56,166
Illegal coil or not,
I don't care.

366
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:58,541
He's broken something
that belongs to me.

367
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:02,208
and for that, I'm going
to make him pay!

368
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:03,833
So, what was he after?

369
00:19:03,916 --> 00:19:05,833
It would seem that he's
screening candidates.

370
00:19:05,916 --> 00:19:07,291
What do you mean?

371
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:11,958
[KYOMA] It's addressed
to all Collectors.

372
00:19:12,041 --> 00:19:15,250
Well, all those who haven't
been scared off, anyway.

373
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:17,958
Four is well known for having
skills as a bodyguard.

374
00:19:18,041 --> 00:19:21,875
This guy took him on as a
demonstration. The bastard.

375
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:24,541
[KYOMA gasps]
What did he look like?

376
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:27,958
Uh... He was awfully
young-looking.

377
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:30,833
And about the same size as Mira.

378
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:33,875
He had a darker
complexion, though.

379
00:19:33,958 --> 00:19:35,500
[KYOMA]
Just as I thought.

380
00:19:40,791 --> 00:19:43,583
[SALVA]
It's been a long time, Claire.

381
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:46,541
I selected it
specifically for today.

382
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:49,041
Seventy-two years old, is it?

383
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:51,125
Château l'Artaud Millennium.

384
00:19:51,208 --> 00:19:53,666
As the name implies, this
particular wine is intended

385
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:56,208
to commemorate the year 2000.

386
00:19:57,666 --> 00:19:59,625
And what are
you insinuating?

387
00:19:59,708 --> 00:20:01,958
I'm not quite as old
as that, Your Highness.

388
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:04,708
[laughs] No, of course not!

389
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:06,875
Beauty is knowledge
and discipline.

390
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:09,833
Without knowledge, beauty is
hollow, and without discipline,

391
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:11,583
there can be no knowledge.

392
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:14,708
The world can only be at peace
when both are in harmony.

393
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:19,333
Something you understand well.
It's what makes you beautiful.

394
00:20:19,416 --> 00:20:21,416
[CLAIRE] I am truly
honored, Your Highness.

395
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,458
But both you and I
know that is not

396
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:26,958
what you came here
to speak to me about.

397
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:28,833
Shall we get to the point?

398
00:20:28,916 --> 00:20:30,791
[chuckles]

399
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:37,500
[SALVA] I wish to discuss the
legacy left by Dr. Yurizaki.

400
00:20:37,583 --> 00:20:40,500
Surely not. You must be joking.

401
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:43,000
I'm really not known
for my sense of humor.

402
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:45,291
[CLAIRE] This is dangerous
thinking, Your Highness.

403
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:47,625
Predicting the actions of
cowards is an endeavor

404
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:49,291
easier said than done.

405
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:51,791
If things don't go well,
we could be facing the breakout

406
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,125
of another war.

407
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:56,291
[SALVA] But fortunately,
wars are my specialty.

408
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:01,625
Am I not, after all,
Salva-Enna-Tebesti?

409
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:05,250
Better known to many as
the Wind that controls Africa.

410
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:08,083
I will not falter.
I will not fail.

411
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:11,208
With that said, however,
you have no reason to worry.

412
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:14,083
Whatever you fear,
I'm not a fool, Claire.

413
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:16,666
[CLAIRE] Then you're saying
you won't start a war?

414
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:19,125
[SALVA] Actually, that's
exactly why I came here.

415
00:21:19,208 --> 00:21:21,666
To inform you that I
intend to start a war

416
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,791
in order to avoid a war.

417
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:26,958
Well, that's enigmatic.

418
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:29,250
[SALVA]
I propose a simple contest.

419
00:21:29,333 --> 00:21:31,458
One in which anyone
can participate.

420
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:33,291
A race, so to speak.

421
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:37,000
Now, then. As to the location.

422
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:39,916
I'd thought some isolated
ruins would be appropriate.

423
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,583
Easter Island.

424
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:45,583
[CLAIRE]
Easter Island...

425
00:21:45,666 --> 00:21:49,666
Of all places...
it will be there?

426
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:53,250
I wonder what the Beast
is going to make of that.

427
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:54,625
[footsteps tapping]

428
00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:55,958
[KYOMA]
Come on. Time to go.

429
00:21:56,041 --> 00:21:58,250
[MIRA]
Uh--! Hey, wait a second!

430
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:05,333
[MIRA] So, Kyoma?
Why are you still here?

431
00:22:05,416 --> 00:22:07,833
Shouldn't you be going
to Easter Island?

432
00:22:07,916 --> 00:22:09,291
[KYOMA]
When I finish this.

433
00:22:09,375 --> 00:22:11,416
[MIRA gasps]
Then I'll help you!

434
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,875
[KYOMA]
Go away.

435
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,250
Okay, I will.

436
00:22:21,166 --> 00:22:23,916
[MIRA]
Hey, Kyoma! It's raining!

437
00:22:29,458 --> 00:22:31,375
[KYOMA]
I met her by chance.

438
00:22:31,458 --> 00:22:33,541
It could easily
never have happened.

439
00:22:34,708 --> 00:22:36,166
[KYOMA]
Stupid rain!

440
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,875
[MIYABI]
Excuse me.

441
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:41,166
[KYOMA]
What was that?

442
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:42,666
[MIYABI]
Over here!

443
00:22:43,791 --> 00:22:47,041
I'm sorry, but do you think
you could help me please?
