Are you kidding me?

I send you out for illegal coils

and you bring me back
this crazy thing?

362
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:49,833
[KYOMA] What? It's just
a little souvenir.

363
00:19:49,916 --> 00:19:52,083
Have you figured
anything out, Koorogi?

364
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:54,625
To be honest with you
Mary, I'm surprised.

365
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:56,041
At what, you ask?

366
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:58,166
The fact that our friend here
could be stupid enough

367
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:00,083
to think that this
magnificent specimen

368
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:03,375
is the property of
an ordinary Collector.

369
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:04,583
Tch.

370
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:06,583
First off, Collectors
aren't exactly known

371
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:08,083
for their spectacular wealth.

372
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:10,083
There's no way one could
make or buy something

373
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:11,875
this expensive
and sophisticated.

374
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:13,875
This kind of specialty
work would easily cost

375
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:16,791
as much as a satellite.

376
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:20,416
The basic body construction
is the same as Four over there.

377
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,166
But underneath
the artificial skin

378
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:24,083
is a layer of subtle
silicone foam,

379
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:26,583
and high-polymer artificial
muscles laid over

380
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:30,375
a skeletal frame filled with
nanomachines for self-repair.

381
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:32,500
Then there's the
coil on her chest.

382
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:34,208
It controls all the actuators

383
00:20:34,291 --> 00:20:37,416
with a wireless
local energy network.

384
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,583
Not that there aren't
plenty of this type of

385
00:20:39,666 --> 00:20:41,083
maintenance-free robot,

386
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:43,250
but they're all copies
of the original.

387
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:47,250
They usually contain traces
of compromise or streamlining.

388
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:49,375
But this baby doesn't
have any of that.

389
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:51,833
It's so complete it's annoying.

390
00:20:51,916 --> 00:20:53,333
Is it really
that big a deal?

391
00:20:53,416 --> 00:20:54,750
Well here's the thing.

392
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:56,458
As far as I know,
the only one who could make

393
00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:58,666
something like this
is Dr. Yurizaki.

396
00:21:02,458 --> 00:21:04,208
[MARY] Who said you
could turn it on?

397
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:07,083
Won't it send
information to New Tesla?

398
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:09,916
Not if it's an official
coil used in a legal way.

399
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,708
No specific information will
be transmitted from the unit

400
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:14,708
if it meets those requirements.

401
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:21,000
Hey. You sure about this?

402
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:23,333
Maybe we should just
turn it back off.

And while you're at it,
be a good little robot

413
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:42,333
and switch off the attitude.

414
00:21:42,416 --> 00:21:44,666
Would you please stop
referring to me as a robot?

415
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:46,500
I'm a girl, thank you very much!

416

[KYOMA grunts]

417
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:50,583
You weren't kidding.
This is an incredible machine.

418
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:51,708
It almost makes you wonder

419
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:53,708
if there's a real
person inside there.

420
00:21:53,791 --> 00:21:56,875
If you want I can open up
the head and check it out.

421
00:21:56,958 --> 00:21:58,458
Though I have no
idea where to start

422
00:21:58,541 --> 00:22:00,208
making sense of these protocols.

423
00:22:00,291 --> 00:22:02,000
Between that and
the organic structure,

424
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:04,250
I probably couldn't put it
back the way I found it.

425
00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:06,708
Heh, heh. Honestly,
the easiest way to learn more

426
00:22:06,791 --> 00:22:08,416
would be to ask the
one who made her.

427
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:11,625
[MARY] Dr. Yurizaki?
That I would like to do.
