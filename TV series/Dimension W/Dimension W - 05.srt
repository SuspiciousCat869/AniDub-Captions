My name is Shiro Kamiki.

That's what I'm called

Now, answer my question.

You came here from
a different place.

There's no sign of Mira

Not yet.

the ghosts and coil.

That's why he was able to
prevent them from appearing.

Which means, he probably
kept something nearby

will that really be "me"?

They can only take form

121
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:19,208
To disperse them,
you have to use water

from a different source.

00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:46,000
Those guys had
Professor Kuroda's notes.

163
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:49,375
Good news, Papa.
I know where it is.

164
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:50,916
[LOSER] Doesn't matter.
I'm calling it off.

165
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:51,916
We're retreating.

166
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,750
Why? It's almost ours.

167
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:55,541
[LOSER]
Because of the second Grendel.

168
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:58,250
He's far too interested in us.

169
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,916
Huh. Who cares about him?

170
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:10,916
[LOSER] I'm afraid going up
against two of the Beasts

171
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,875
could prove to be
exceptionally challenging.

172
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:14,500
Even for us.

173
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:16,250
[ALBERT]
How unpleasant.

174
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:18,333
When I came here I didn't
think I'd end up working

175
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:21,333
with Loser's little sidekick.

176
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:24,625
Mabuchi, you'd better
make this worth it.

177
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:30,875
[MIRA] Shiro Kamiki is Shijuro
Sakaki from 21 years ago.

178
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:33,166
But he only exists now in
the world that was stored

179
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:35,291
in Dimension W by the Numbers.

180
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:36,958
[KYOMA]
What a damn hopeless mess.

181
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:38,708
You're tellin' me
this guy's past self

182
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:41,208
killed his present self...

183
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:43,791
People wonder why I
hate coils? This is why.

184
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:47,083
[MIRA] What was stored wasn't
simply an event from the past.

185
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:48,875
It was another
possibility in which

186
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:50,625
Kamiki's friends didn't die.

187
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:53,375
Because in that world,
he was able to save them.

188
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:11,041
[KAMIKI] This is the perfect
way to show people

189
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:12,750
what coils can do.

190
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:14,000
It's so important.

191
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:15,958
They're the solution to
all our energy problems,

192
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:18,375
and it's time for people
to realize that.

193
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:20,833
With technology like this,
there's no need for a dam.

194
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:22,583
And the village will be saved!

195
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:23,541

[MITANI chuckles]

Why's your arm bandaged?

198
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:29,000
This? I just got a little cut.

199
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:30,500
You should be more careful.

200
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:33,166
You've always been such a klutz,
ever since we were little.

201
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:34,916
And you've always
been a crybaby,

202
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,250
ever since we were little.

203
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:37,291
Oh, shut up.

204
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:38,500
You know, we're gonna
have to work

Stop that, Mr. Mitani.

208
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:45,458
You're supposed to be
covering the coils, not us.

209

[MITANI laughs]

210
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:49,291
Who's that guy?

211
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,791
Just some journalist.

212
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:53,416
He says he's filming a report
on the coil or something.

213
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,291
I figured a little
publicity can't hurt.

[ENAMORI] What's wrong?
Concerned about interference?

00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:09,250
I'm more worried about
what the weather's gonna do.

00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:10,625
I'm gonna go take a look.

There wasn't anything
in the forecast, though.

I can't believe you'd think

00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:00,791
we'd broadcast
a report on coils.

Don't you get it?

An infinite energy supply

a lotta problems.

That is incorrect.

321
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:42,750
[gasps]

322
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:45,458
[MIRA] Your world is
not what you think.

323
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:48,791
It is not made up of Enamori's
thoughts or memories.

324
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:52,750
Don't touch her!

325
00:18:00,958 --> 00:18:04,583
What the hell is
going on? Where is she?

326
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:07,583
[MIRA]
The world you exist in

327
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:10,083
is your other
possibility, Kamiki.

328
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:12,458
My other... possibility?

329
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:13,833
[MIRA]
That's right.

330
00:18:13,916 --> 00:18:15,791
An alternate world in which
you saved your friends

331
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:18,000
and grieved Enamori's death.

332
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:20,875
A world that could have been.

333
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:22,500
What're you--?

334
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:24,583
[MIRA]
You believed she was dead,

335
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:27,375
but Enamori was
actually still alive.

336
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:28,541
You're lying.

337
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:30,333
You don't see it, do you?

338
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:33,833
That's not Marisa.
That's Enamori.

339
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:36,708
No, that's Marisa.
That's my sister, it has to be!

340
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:38,083
No, it isn't.

341
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:40,875
You spent so long believing
Enamori was dead,

342
00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:43,750
that you can't see what's
right before your eyes.

343
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:47,041
[SAKAKI] That's right.
The real Marisa is dead.

344
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:49,916
There was a car accident
14 years ago.

345
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:54,375
This isn't possible.

346
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:55,791
[SAKAKI]
I abandoned my friends

347
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:57,875
and went after Enamori instead.

348
00:18:57,958 --> 00:19:01,458
I was able to save
her from drowning.

349
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:03,750
She lived, but she
forgot everything

350
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:06,208
from before the accident.

351
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:08,625
I left Yasogami Village
and changed my name

352
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:11,291
in order to lead a quiet,
private life.

353
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:15,500
I hoped that we could somehow
leave the tragedy behind us.

354
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:18,250
But Enamori was
tortured by nightmares.

355
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:21,083
In her dreams, she could see
that those who died in the flood

356
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:24,166
had become ghosts and
were attacking people.

357
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:27,875
[SAKAKI] Professor Kuroda
helped me understand

358
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:30,291
what was happening.
Three threads tied

359
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:32,458
the real world to the
world of the ghosts:

360
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:37,875
the coil, the water from Lake
Yasogami, and Enamori's dreams.

361
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:40,166
In order to be free
of her nightmares,

362
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,291
she had to be separated
from the coil

363
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:44,416
and the water of Lake Yasogami.

364
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,166
[KAMIKI]
I don't understand!

365
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:49,208
You could have just destroyed
the coil, couldn't you?

366
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:51,750
Why did you have to trick us
and hide it in the dam?

367
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:56,083
That's why we did it.
That's why we killed you!

368
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:57,416
It's not that simple.

369
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,000
Think about what
would have happened

370
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:00,416
if I'd stopped the coil.

371
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,625
[KAMIKI grunts]

372
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:03,750
My dead friends lived
on in another world.

373
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:07,166
I wanted to protect it.
I wanted to protect them.

374
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:09,541
[KAMIKI gasping]

375
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:13,333
Look, Kamiki. You should
be able to see Enamori now.

376
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:15,583
Your perception of her
death had to be changed,

377
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:17,875
that's why you couldn't
see it before.

378
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:26,750
[KAMIKI]
Enamori?

379
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:32,208
I can't believe it!
I've waited for so long.

380
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:34,541
And now, here you are.

381
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:35,958
[sobs]

382
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:39,291
[KAMIKI]
It's true? You really survived?

383
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:42,333
I did! But it was
all so horrible!

384
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:44,333
I couldn't do anything!

385
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:48,666
I just watched while everyone
suffered. I felt so lost!

386
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:51,916
I could never help anyone,
but I was always,

387
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,125
always watching.

388
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:57,833
[KAMIKI] I'm so sorry. I thought
I was doing it for your sake,

389
00:20:57,916 --> 00:20:59,666
but all I did was hurt you more.

390
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:02,333
[ENAMORI]
No, that isn't true!

391
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:04,291
I'm not hurting, now.

392
00:21:04,375 --> 00:21:08,541
I'm happy because I'm
finally with you again.

393
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:14,833
[KAMIKI] I've caused so much
pain. It's time. Let's end this.

394
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:18,833
[rumbling]

395
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:21,666
[KYOMA]
What's that sound?

396
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:24,083
[MIRA] The alternate world
created in Dimension W

397
00:21:24,166 --> 00:21:26,125
is converging with reality.

398
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:28,208
When the Numbers go wild,
they create cracks

399
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:33,250
in Dimension W. Each crack, in
turn, creates a copy of reality.

400
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:36,791
And every world created
holds a different possibility.

401
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:38,250
That's confusing.

402
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:41,833
Copies usually disappear almost
as soon as they're made.

403
00:21:41,916 --> 00:21:44,125
But in this case, the coil
continued to function,

404
00:21:44,208 --> 00:21:46,625
so this world was
able to remain.

405
00:21:46,708 --> 00:21:48,375
[KYOMA]
Hm.

406
00:21:49,916 --> 00:21:52,500
[KAMIKI] It looks
like our time is up.

407
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:54,416
This is goodbye.

408
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:57,833
Yes. I have to go back, too.

409
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:00,833
Can I ask you something?

410
00:22:00,916 --> 00:22:02,708
[KYOMA]
What?

411
00:22:02,791 --> 00:22:04,916
If I told you
I could see Heaven,

412
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,458
would you believe me?

413
00:22:06,541 --> 00:22:08,041
Not a chance.

414
00:22:08,125 --> 00:22:11,208
I've always heard that people
who kill themselves go to Hell.

415
00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:15,708
Huh. Is that so? I guess
we'll see, won't we?

416
00:22:27,208 --> 00:22:28,083
[KYOMA]
Hey.

417
00:22:28,166 --> 00:22:29,083
[MIRA]
Yes?

418
00:22:29,166 --> 00:22:30,375
What are you doing
with your tail?

419
00:22:30,458 --> 00:22:32,583
[MIRA gasps]
Oh, well,

420
00:22:32,666 --> 00:22:35,208
there could be serious
consequences if the coil stops

421
00:22:35,291 --> 00:22:37,458
before the convergence
is complete.

422
00:22:37,541 --> 00:22:39,875
To prevent that,
I'm controlling it.

423
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:42,958
It's embarrassing. I would
prefer it if you didn't watch.

424
00:22:43,041 --> 00:22:45,208
Since when do robots
get embarrassed?

425
00:22:45,291 --> 00:22:47,541
--You stupid piece of junk.
--[MIRA grunts]

426
00:23:07,583 --> 00:23:09,583
There was no sign
of Albert or Ellie.

427
00:23:09,666 --> 00:23:11,875
Guess they both
must've left already.

428
00:23:11,958 --> 00:23:13,458
[KYOMA]
I guess so.

429
00:23:13,541 --> 00:23:15,166
I still don't understand
why we're going

430
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:17,208
when the case hasn't
been completely solved.

431
00:23:17,291 --> 00:23:20,583
Uh-- The police are
the ones who solve cases.

432
00:23:20,666 --> 00:23:24,375
All we do is
collect coils. Got it?

433
00:23:24,458 --> 00:23:26,208
[MIRA]
Right. Of course.

434
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:35,666
[MIRA]
Kyoma is still such a mystery.

435
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:37,958
What kind of person is he?

436
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:41,500
What happened to make
him hate coils so much?

437
00:23:41,583 --> 00:23:42,791
And another thing:

438
00:23:42,875 --> 00:23:45,250
Why would someone who
hates coils choose a job

439
00:23:45,333 --> 00:23:47,166
that revolves around them?

440
00:23:54,333 --> 00:23:57,625
[KATO] Yes, I did what
the voices told me to.

441
00:23:57,708 --> 00:24:00,166
I emptied the water dispenser,
then I replaced it

442
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:02,458
with water from Lake Yasogami.

443
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:06,458
I had to. For my father.

444
00:24:06,541 --> 00:24:08,791
He was on duty at the dam
administrative building

445
00:24:08,875 --> 00:24:11,458
21 years ago when it happened.

446
00:24:12,958 --> 00:24:16,791
[KATO] All this time,
he's been out there.
