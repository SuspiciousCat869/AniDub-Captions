She was wearing a

Wait! There should
be an image in my log.

What? There's nothing there.

That doesn't make sense!

Maybe it really was a ghost,
like I was saying.

of ghosts. Now get in.

Have a seat.

00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:03,500
I'm here in an
official capacity.

27
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:05,583
New Tesla has a job
it needs done.

28
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:07,708
Here, take a look at this.

29
00:03:07,791 --> 00:03:09,416
A report about an
incident that happened

30
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,833
at Lake Yasogami last week.

31
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:14,000
The man who died
was Shijuro Sakaki,

32
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:16,125
known for his grotesque
mystery novels.

33
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:18,250
The incident occurred
in the study of his home,

34
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:20,500
which serves as the local hotel.

35
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:22,750
The cause of death was drowning.

36
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:24,666
There was no sign of
anyone coming or going

37
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,916
from the room.
The novelist was alone

38
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,625
save for the housekeeping robot.

39
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:31,208
The room contained
a water dispenser,

40
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:33,875
which was empty at the time
the body was discovered.

41
00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:35,125
So, what happened, then?

42
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:37,041
The robot forced the
water from the dispenser

43
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:37,916
down his throat?

44
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,083
[ALBERT]
For a robot to kill,

45
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:40,958
it would have to run
on an illegal coil.

46
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:42,583
An official coil would
submit a report

47
00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:44,625
to New Tesla and shut down.

48
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:47,333
Of course, the case gets a bit
more complicated than that.

49
00:03:47,416 --> 00:03:49,375
If this was simply a matter
of an illegal coil,

50
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:51,416
I wouldn't have
bothered you with it.

[KYOMA sighs]

52

[ALBERT] Here's the video
recorded by the robot's camera.

53
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:59,500
[SAKAKI] I'd like some water,
Keebo. Get it for me.

54
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:01,916
[KEEBO]
Yes, sir. Right away.

55
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:10,916

Here you are, sir. Your water.

00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:14,083

59
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:19,791

60
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:22,500
Very. And it doesn't return
until two minutes later.

[door creaks]

63
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:26,458
[KATO] Pardon me, sir.
Mind if I come in?

64
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:28,083
I brought your...

65
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:30,125
[gasps]

66
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:31,166
[KATO screams]

67
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:33,166
We inspected
the coil, of course,

68
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:36,166
but, like the robot,
we found no problem with it.

69
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:39,041
No trace of an illegal
coil being used, either.

70
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:41,250
Which means that whoever
killed Sakaki may have

71
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:44,416
some way of circumventing
New Tesla's security.

72
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,833
That's where you come in.

73
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:47,958
I want you to find whatever
was used to interfere

74
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:50,583
with the robot and
collect it, if possible.

75
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:53,083
Why not do it yourselves?

76
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:55,958
We'd rather outsource.
It's the ghosts, you see.

77

[KYOMA]
Hm?

78
00:04:57,916 --> 00:05:00,333
[ALBERT] Lake Yasogami
is a manmade lake created

79
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:02,666
when a dam was built
21 years ago.

80
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:05,500
Its rushed construction and
bad weather led to an accident

81
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:07,416
that claimed a large
number of lives.

82
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,166
Ever since that tragedy,
the area has become famous

83
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:12,166
for sightings of the paranormal.

84
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,875
Spooky, don't you think?

85
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:15,708
[KYOMA]
Tch. Ghost stories, Al?

86
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:19,208
Anyway, we're taking
this job. You on board?

87
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:22,208
You ask that like I
actually have a choice.

88
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:34,125
Listen up, ya heap of metal.

89
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:35,291
Yes?

90
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:36,875
[KYOMA]
There'll be other guests here.

91
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:39,583
So you need to act
like a normal robot.

92
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:41,708
Don't cry or laugh
or get scared

93
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:44,291
of stuff like ghosts, okay?

94
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:46,916
Right. I'll do my best not to.

This is Ms. Marisa Sakaki.

you'll meet the same fate

I had planned an island getaway,
but at the last minute,

I decided that coming here
would be much more interesting.

So, I made a few changes
to my itinerary.

Is this the partner you've
recently acquired, Mabuchi?

After what happened,
you were practically a shut-in

until she helped you return
to society as a Collector.

153

And you repay her by
running off to Dendendo

and keeping her out of the loop?

Get the hell outta here!

What are you doing?
This is the third floor!

168
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:50,708
Sadly, that's not high enough.

169

Tomorrow at 9pm. The lounge.

170

We'll have a drink
and chat a little.

171

I'll see ya there.

172

Wow. He's amazing.

173
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:05,458
[KYOMA]
Of course he is.

174

That goes without saying
for a beast of Grendel.

175

[MIRA] Sorry, what's
a beast of Grendel?

176

Just a name, that's all.

Huh.

So, sleeping arrangements...

181
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:28,625
[KYOMA]
I'll take the bed in the back.

182
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:31,166
You can help yourself
to the sofa.

183
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:33,458
Right. That's what
I was thinking.

Oh, good morning!
Is it time to get up now?

191
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:22,166
How much sleep can
a robot possibly need?

192
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:23,000
Piece of junk.

193
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:26,041
P-P-P-Piece of junk?

Y'see all these books?

196

I want you to scan through them.

197
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:33,750
[MIRA] Wouldn't it be easier
if we just downloaded them

198

from the internet?

199

Don't be stupid.

[screams]

00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,666
Jeez! Don't sneak up
on me like that!

208
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:37,166
What did I tell you about
being scared of everything?

209
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:38,708
I know, I'm sorry!

210
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:41,333
But I store information
in images, and that makes

211
00:11:41,416 --> 00:11:43,916
reading books a very
immersive experience.

212
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,208
[KYOMA] Yeah, whatever.
Just hurry up and finish.

213
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:48,291
[MIRA]
Okay, but--

214
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:53,875
Mira. It is not enough

215
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:56,166
for you to store
data in your memory.

216
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,125
As you process a
piece of information,

217
00:11:58,208 --> 00:12:00,041
use it to create an image.

218
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:02,000
If the information
seems incomplete,

219
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:05,500
fill it in using memories
you've already stored.

220
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:07,500
When you're given
new information,

221
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:10,000
you must access all the images
that are related to it

222
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:13,625
and rebuild them accordingly.

223
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:14,916
I miss you, Father.

226
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,666
I'll pick up the pace a bit.

[KYOMA] Bastard. You knew
one of the Numbers was here

234
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,958
the whole time, didn't you?
Why didn't you say so earlier?

235
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:32,958
What, and talk about
Numbers in front of Mary

236
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:35,666
when you'd already
avoided doing just that?

237
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:38,041
Heh. Look, just have a drink.

238
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:41,916
Here you are.
Thanks for waiting.

239
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:45,666
The accident you mentioned.

240
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:48,583
Only one of the dead was part
of the construction crew.

241
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:51,375
The rest were students,
and there was a coil involved.

242
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:53,750
This wasn't a
simple accident, was it?

243
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,250
[ALBERT]
Why do ya say that?

244
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:57,875
[KYOMA] Twenty-one years ago,
there weren't any towers.

245
00:13:57,958 --> 00:14:00,375
Which means the coil must have
been one of the Numbers.

246
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:02,250
Unstable and unpredictable.

247
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:04,291
The Numbers caused
a horrific accident,

248
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:06,625
and the students
were its victims.

249
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:09,125
Obviously, New Tesla
covered the incident up.

250
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:11,625
But they still haven't
managed to retrieve the thing.

251
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:15,500
[laughs] Glad to see you
haven't lost your edge.

252
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:18,291
You're only half-right, though.
The accident was just that.

253
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:20,625
A tragic, but otherwise
unremarkable event.

254
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:21,875
Seriously?

255
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:24,333
But, around the same time,
one of the Numbers

256
00:14:24,416 --> 00:14:27,250
was activated in this area.
That's the part of this

257
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:29,833
unfortunate story that
you've got correct.

258
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:34,333
[ALBERT] This is Kenjiro Kuroda,
professor of physics,

259
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:38,291
and his student Haruna Enamori,
a native of Yasogami.

260
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:41,041
At the time, Numbers
coil 189 was on loan

261
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:45,916
to Kuroda's laboratory. Enamori
used her access to borrow it.

262
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,041
[KYOMA] So, she was probably
the one who activated it.

263
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:51,583
And hers was the
only body not found.

264
00:14:51,666 --> 00:14:53,500
The Bureau sent out
search parties twice

265
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:55,000
in the years that followed.

266
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:57,750
But both times, the teams
apparently encountered ghosts.

267
00:14:57,833 --> 00:14:59,916
Their bodies were
found later, drowned.

268
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,833
All of which was the result
of the Numbers going crazy.

269
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:05,416
[ALBERT] That does seem like
the obvious conclusion.

270
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,416
As you guessed,
they never found the coil.

271
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,750
But the ghosts stopped
appearing ten years ago.

272
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:11,458
So, no more teams were sent out.

273
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:13,500
But when Shijuro Sakaki
was murdered,

274
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:16,250
you assumed that the
ghosts had reappeared.

275
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:19,208
And wasn't it ten years back
that he came to Yasogami?

276
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:21,583
That's just too much
to be a coincidence.

277
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:24,375
You think he knew something
even the Bureau didn't?

278
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:26,208
Something about the Numbers?

279
00:15:26,291 --> 00:15:29,708
That seems likely, but
unfortunately, I have no proof.

280
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,666
[KYOMA]
Hmph.

281
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:38,083
[KYOMA]
'S pretty good.

282
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:40,750
[ALBERT] Yeah, it was the
chef's recommendation.

283
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:46,916
[MIRA] I can't take it.
His novels are too gruesome!

284
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,500
He describes pain
and suffering

285
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:51,375
with so much detail,
it's sickening.

286
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:53,291
It all felt so real.

287
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:56,208
I could almost smell
his characters' fear.

288
00:15:56,291 --> 00:15:59,916
Still, despite all that,
I did notice something.

289
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,083
His books' settings are
reminiscent of Yasogami Village

290
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:05,833
as it looked in the past.

291

[MIRA grunts]

292
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:20,625

I've created of Yasogami

293
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:23,083
as it appeared 21 years ago.

294
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:27,041
There's a clue here somewhere.
I'm sure there is.

295
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:28,083

so hard on the image

I was for a second.

00:17:42,916 --> 00:17:45,500
[MORINAGA] Would you like
an arm that matches mine?

317
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:49,291
[ALBERT] You and I know
first-hand the tragedy

318
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:51,666
that Numbers can cause.

319
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,791
The inexplicable horrors.

320
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:57,375
You were the only one there
that day who survived.

321
00:17:57,458 --> 00:17:59,875
That's why I chose
you for this job.

322
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:03,125
Not only because of your
strength, but because you know.

323
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:06,958
[phone rings]

324
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:08,125
[KYOMA]
Find anything?

325
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:09,708
[KOOROGI laughs]
Do you really need to ask?

326
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:11,541
This is me we're talking about.

327
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:14,166
Of course I found
something. It was easy.

328
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:15,916
[KYOMA]
Spit it out. Al's here, too.

329
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,250
Okay, cool.

330
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:19,125
Put your phone next to his,
we're gonna need it.

331
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:20,708
I'll project what I've got.

332
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:23,916
It'll drain that old-school
battery of yours in no time.

333
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,750
All right, here we go.

334
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,083
[ALBERT, KYOMA grunt]

335
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:31,041
This is the more complete
version of the video

336
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:33,125
taken by the housekeeping robot.

337
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:36,583
I restored it as
much as I could.

338
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:39,416
This is what happened during
the missing two minutes?

339
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,541
[KOOROGI] That blackout out in
the original occurred because

340
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:44,291
the memory was
overwritten in real time.

341
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:46,541
The original data stream
was so large that the robot

342
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,833
could only record
bits and pieces of it.

343
00:18:48,916 --> 00:18:50,666
Whoever those people are,
their appearance

344
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,708
has something to do with a coil.

345
00:18:52,791 --> 00:18:53,916
[ALBERT]
Are they real?

346
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,708
[KOOROGI]
They have no mass.

347
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:57,833
If they did, we'd be in trouble.

348
00:18:57,916 --> 00:19:00,708
The materialization
of Dimension W.

349
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:03,375
Wait. There should be
an image in my log.

350
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:05,958
Hold on. It's not there.

351
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:08,250
So she really did see something.

352
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:10,375
Koorogi, can you
compare these people

353
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:12,416
to the ones who
died 21 years ago?

354
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,208
[KOOROGI]
Huh? Sure, gimme a sec.

355
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:17,458
[KYOMA] From what we know so
far, I wouldn't be surprised

356
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:21,250
to find a connection between the
victims and Sakaki's killers.

357
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:22,500
I see where you're going.

358
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:24,333
You think the Numbers
sealed up the tragedy

359
00:19:24,416 --> 00:19:27,291
and everyone who was
involved within Dimension W.

360
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:28,333
Huh.

361
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:30,500
[MIRA] Somehow I've been
dragged into memories

362
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:32,500
from 21 years ago!

363
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:34,291
[MORINAGA laughing]

364
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:36,625
[MIRA] When did it first
happen? In the bathroom?

365
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:41,208
No, before that. It's been
happening since I got here.

366
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:45,375
The world of the past is layered
on top of the real world.

367
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:48,125
And now... I can't get out!

368
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:50,041
[gasps]

369

[GHOSTS screaming, moaning]

370
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:53,125
[MIRA] This isn't truly
a memory, though.

371
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:54,541
Nothing as simple as that.

372
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:56,583
[GHOST screams]

373
00:19:56,666 --> 00:20:00,416
[MIRA] It's like something
out of one of Sakaki's novels.

374
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,208
[MIRA screams]

375
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:06,500
[laughs] You entered
my darling's room

376
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:09,583
without permission, and now
I'll watch you suffer for it.

377
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,375
[MIRA] I can't do anything
as long as I'm bound

378
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:14,541
by the logic of
this world. I'm helpless!

379
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:18,708
Please, Kyoma!
I need you! Help me!

380
00:20:18,791 --> 00:20:20,083
[KOOROGI]
Bingo, Kyoma. That's it!

[KYOMA grunts]

382

[KOOROGI] Other than that
Kamiki guy in the middle,

383
00:20:22,958 --> 00:20:25,208
they're all students who
died years ago in the flood.

384
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:26,958
Shiro Kamiki?

385
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:29,541
[KOOROGI laughs]
Yep. The plot thickens.

386
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:31,666
Seems Sakaki was a pen name.

387
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:34,125
Please, Mr. Mabuchi,
you're needed at once!

388
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:36,125
It's Mr. Hageyama!

Why are you here?
Are you a Collector?

You've called the police?

reach them for some time now,

of junk when I need her?

be sleeping again.

I see you've woken up.

I'm afraid that doesn't
work for us, Miss Sakaki.

We'll need you to
go back to sleep.

No...

a little reading, you see.

dreams are necessary

to connect to the other side.

You'll be safer under
our supervision.

you're our hostage.
