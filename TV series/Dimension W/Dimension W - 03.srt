[NARRATOR] In the year 2036,
a fourth dimensional axis

proved to exist. Dimension W.

Inter-dimensional

as "coils," were developed

Sixty giant towers
spread across the globe

Although to be honest, I would
really appreciate a bed

someplace private to change.

[KYOMA]
You don't need that stuff.

I need the same basic living
conditions everyone does

so I can keep my parts clean
and in good working order.

My body is full of
nano-machines that circulate

64
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:52,791
through it like blood circulates
through your veins and arteries.

In order to keep me
at peak condition,

66
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:57,583
those machines are
continually making repairs.

67
00:04:57,666 --> 00:04:59,291
Of course, the
nano-machines themselves

68
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:02,083
are also continually
detaching and reconfiguring.

You might not realize it,

70

but repairs can only
be made so quickly.

71

That's why it's recommended that
I take regular breaks for sleep,

though the amount I need
varies according to my activity.

sleep just like you.

sleep in a bed, not standing up.

me, though? I'm his partner,

00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,333
They'd take me and Mary, too.

317
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:37,166
Mary warned me
very clearly not to,

318
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:40,041
but I still let myself
get complacent.

319
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:43,625
I've never had much contact
with humans outside of Father.

320
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:45,916
It was such an incredible
feeling to interact

321
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,458
with people and feel accepted.

322
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:49,958
I should thank them.

323
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:52,083
If I see them again, I'll thank
those kids for treating me

324
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:55,500
like a person and
keeping my secret.

325
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:02,208
[door clicks]

326
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:06,125
[KYOMA]
It's Kyoma.

327
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:07,625
[MARY]
You're calling me?

328
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:10,958
It's usually the other way
around. I assume it's about her?

329
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:12,750
[KYOMA]
What do you know so far?

330
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:14,208
[MARY]
Well, I know I'm still alive

331
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:18,625
and not in New Tesla custody,
but that's about it.

332
00:17:18,708 --> 00:17:21,416
We've got repairs to make.
I'll need Koorogi.

333
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,916
[MARY]
He's all yours.

334
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,416
All right, good deal.

335
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,708
And thank you for sorting
things out earlier, by the way.

336
00:17:26,791 --> 00:17:28,208
[MARY]
For sorting what out?

337
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:30,041
[KYOMA] Weren't you the one
who got me released?

338
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:31,208
[MARY]
No.

339
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:33,041
As much as I like doing
business with you,

340
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:34,333
I'm afraid I can't
claim the credit

341
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:36,250
for springing you from jail.

342
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:38,541
Well, who was it, then?

343
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:39,916
[MARY]
Believe it or not,

344
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,750
the COO of New Tesla
Central 47: Claire Skyheart.

345
00:17:58,666 --> 00:18:01,125
If you'll come this way, please.

346
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:02,958
[KYOMA grunts]

347
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,958
[CLAIRE] I don't believe
we've ever met before.

348
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:18,125
Have we, Mr. Mabuchi?

349
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,208
[KYOMA]
So you're her?

350
00:18:21,291 --> 00:18:23,166
COO Claire Skyheart.

351
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:26,000
I hope I didn't keep you waiting
long, but I'm a busy woman.

352
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:28,041
You're looking well,
after recent events.

353
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:30,000
What business do
you have with me?

354
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:32,083
Why'd you get me
released from custody?

355
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:33,875
Because it seemed
to me that the fault

356
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:35,875
did not lie entirely with you.

357
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:38,583
Even if that's true,
you're a New Tesla exec.

358
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:40,458
Is a minor civilian
incident like this

359
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:43,083
--really in your purview?
--[SHIORA] Granma!

360
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:43,833
[SHIORA giggles]

361
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:45,958
[CLAIRE chuckles]

362
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:47,458
So that's it.

363
00:18:47,541 --> 00:18:49,500
[CLAIRE]
This is Shiora Skyheart.

364
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:51,750
She happens to be
my granddaughter.

365
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:54,375
I only found out about this
"minor civilian incident,"

366
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:56,958
as you called it,
because of her.

367
00:18:57,041 --> 00:18:59,791
It would be an exaggeration
to say I had you released,

368
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:02,416
but Shiora and the others
told me about you.

369
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,041
They said you'd warned
them many times

370
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:06,958
to stay away from those cars.
I asked the police

371
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:09,958
to make a fair decision
based on that information.

372
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:11,416
And, to be honest,

373
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,791
I did think it might afford me
the chance to look upon

374
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:15,583
a beast of Grendel in the flesh.

375
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:17,958
Well, you've seen me.
Are we all done here now?

376
00:19:18,041 --> 00:19:19,833
[SHIORA]
Hey! Hold on!

377
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:24,083
[whispering] I didn't think
Granma needed to know about

378
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:25,666
everything that happened.

379
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:28,583
So tell Mira not to worry an'
just hurry up an' get better!

380
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:31,500
I don't think I'll be able
to play anymore, though.

381
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:33,750
[SHIORA giggles]

382
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:45,750
I read your final report
about the Yurizaki incident.

383
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:48,541
The results were as we
had expected them to be?

384
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:49,958
Yes.

385
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:52,208
More disturbing than any
destruction is what is absent.

386
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:54,541
Dr. Yurizaki's remains
have simply vanished,

387
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:58,291
along with everything
that was near him.

388
00:19:58,375 --> 00:20:00,500
We're currently considering
the possibility

389
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:03,083
that the strange coil he had
with him on that balcony

390
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:05,708
was capable of creating
a small black hole.

391
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:07,416
[CLAIRE] You're speaking
of the double coil

392
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,750
mentioned in the report?

393
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:11,208
[ALBERT] Yes. I've never
heard of a coil like that,

394
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:13,000
not even in academic papers.

395
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:15,708
Who knows what it
may be capable of?

396
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:18,375
What I am most
interested to know is

397
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:20,250
what was the
doctor's end-game?

398
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:22,416
He despised us as
the soulless monsters

399
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,083
who took everything
he had from him.

400
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:27,666
I would not be surprised
if he continued his research

401
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:30,708
for the sole purpose
of getting revenge.

402
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:34,958
With him gone for good now,
I suppose we'll never know.

403
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:36,791
I believe I have
everything I need now

404
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:39,041
to make my report to the board.

405
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:41,625
You've done good work,
thank you.

406
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:43,958
Oh, and I've had an
interesting encounter.

407
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:45,500
I thought you'd like to know.

408
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:47,125
I met the other
beast of Grendel.

409
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:48,375
And what did you think?

410
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:50,250
I'd heard that
he'd been damaged.

411
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:53,000
That he was unable to return
to society for quite some time

412
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:55,750
after the incident occurred.
But nothing he did today

413
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:57,833
suggested he has
any lingering issue.

414
00:20:57,916 --> 00:21:00,000
In that case,
I take it you approve?

415
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:02,625
[CLAIRE] I'm comfortable
leaving it to your discretion.

416
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:04,708
That's excellent.
Thank you very much.

[CLAIRE]
This world we've built;

419
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:16,125
it could so easily be destroyed.

420
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:19,333
[NEWSCASTER 1A] At last,
we may have some answers

421
00:21:19,416 --> 00:21:20,958
about the recent explosion.

422
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:24,541
New Tesla Energy has issued a
statement regarding the cause.

423
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:26,625
It seems there were
chemicals illegally dumped

424
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:28,708
at the site of
an abandoned plant.

425
00:21:28,791 --> 00:21:30,416
Those chemicals
reacted with the ones

426
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,916
already present at the plant,
leading to an explosion

427
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,958
and the appearance of a
strange pillar of light.
