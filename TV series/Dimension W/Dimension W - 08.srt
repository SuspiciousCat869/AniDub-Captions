1
00:00:12,625 --> 00:00:16,250
[MIRA] This is so strange:
like we're on another planet.

2
00:00:16,333 --> 00:00:18,708
[MIRA gasps]
Even the microorganisms

3
00:00:18,791 --> 00:00:20,291
must have been wiped out.

4
00:00:20,375 --> 00:00:23,291
That would explain how corpses
like this haven't rotted away.

5
00:00:23,375 --> 00:00:26,000
Take a good, long look
around you, piece of junk.


6
00:00:26,083 --> 00:00:29,833
This mess is what lies beyond
the culture of coils.


7
00:00:32,458 --> 00:00:33,708
[KYOMA]
Well, how'd it go?

8
00:00:33,791 --> 00:00:36,125
I tried, but I can't
make contact with them.

9
00:00:36,208 --> 00:00:38,291
[MIRA] There was a big storm
over the ocean that died down

10
00:00:38,375 --> 00:00:39,583
a few minutes ago.

11
00:00:39,666 --> 00:00:41,500
Is it possible they
decided it would be safer

12
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:43,083
to turn back around?

13
00:00:43,166 --> 00:00:45,083
Something tells me that prince
wouldn't let a storm stop him.

14
00:00:45,166 --> 00:00:47,625
What do we do if we
can't get a signal?

15
00:00:47,708 --> 00:00:50,041
Radar's not gonna do
us any good, either.

16
00:00:50,125 --> 00:00:52,208
Let's forget technology
and rely on our eyes.

17
00:00:52,291 --> 00:00:54,541
If it's a set of eyes you're
looking for, leave it to me.

18
00:00:54,625 --> 00:00:55,791
My vision's excellent, you know.

19
00:00:55,875 --> 00:00:58,375
I can see almost as
far as a satellite.

20
00:00:58,458 --> 00:00:59,958
--[MIRA] Hey!
--How well do think you'll see

--if your coil's not working?

22
00:01:02,375 --> 00:01:04,583
[ALBERT] Modern AIs are
pretty incredible, huh?

23
00:01:04,666 --> 00:01:07,166
They seem more and more
human all the time.

24
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:10,750
Ha. Whatever may have
happened to the rest of 'em,

25
00:01:10,833 --> 00:01:12,666
I'm still going.

26
00:01:14,208 --> 00:01:15,958
[car doors click]

27
00:01:16,041 --> 00:01:19,208
You better be careful. I can't
come save you this time.

28
00:01:19,291 --> 00:01:20,708
[chuckles] I think I'll be fine.

--[engine revs]
--[KYOMA] See ya!

31
00:01:27,791 --> 00:01:32,500
Ah, the sound of a V10 engine.
Just listen to that roar.

32
00:01:32,583 --> 00:01:35,000
Try not to die
out there, Mabuchi.

33
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:08,333
[WORKER 8A]
Your Majesty!

34
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:10,291
We are so honored that you came!

35
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:11,875
[MAURA]
Mm.

36
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:14,333
[WORKER 8A]
Salva! Come over here, please.

37
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:17,041
His Majesty the king
has arrived.

38
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:19,541
The king? And he
wants to see me?

39
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:21,416
So, you're young Salva, are you?

40
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,916
Yes, Your Majesty.
It's an honor to meet you.

41
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,916
As they told me,
you are a promising boy,

42
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,333
with a good look to your face.

43
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:30,791
I do not have a son
of my own, you see.

44
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:33,750
I would have you
become my child, Salva.

45
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:35,625
From this day forward,
you will be known to all

46
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:37,666
as Salva-Enna-Tibesti.

47
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:40,750
Will I be... a prince?

48
00:03:41,416 --> 00:03:42,958
[MAURA] Do you see
what they're building?

49
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:45,791
That's New Tesla Energy's
60th tower.

50
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:49,125
It's a symbol of the future
that awaits our country.

51
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:51,416
Metal essential to the
manufacture of coils

52
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,708
can only be found here in Isla.

53
00:03:53,791 --> 00:03:56,000
That metal is the reason
our country has developed

54
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:58,500
so swiftly in recent years.

55
00:03:58,583 --> 00:04:01,041
As long as we can
continue to supply it,

56
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:03,500
our future will be secure.

57
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:05,208
[SALVA]
But for how long, Father?

58
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:07,208
Our mines will
run out eventually.

59
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:09,583
Our neighbors are already
jealous of our prosperity

60
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,583
and the wealth of our resources.

61
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:14,791
Shouldn't we try to find a more
reliable base for our power?

62
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:18,291
So that we aren't so completely
dependent on one export?

63
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:20,000
[MAURA]
You really are clever, Salva.

64
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:22,375
Far wiser than your years.

65
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:23,791
But remember this:

66
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:28,208
if you hunger for power,
you invite your own destruction.

67
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:30,833
That's one reason I host
banquets for our neighbors:

68
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:34,125
to promote good will and show
that we are not a threat.

69
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:37,250
At times you may see me
acting docile or foolish.

70
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:40,291
It is because, if I do not,
I cannot protect this country.

71
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:42,625
[SERVANT 8A]
Your Majesty, it is time.

72
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:48,166
You' re showing
your weakness, Father.

73
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:49,333
That isn't right.

74
00:04:49,416 --> 00:04:51,125
[SERVANT 8B]

[MAURA]
Now, Salva, you must look after

85
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:19,041
your younger brother and
support him in all ways.

86
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:22,708
because someday, this child
will be king of Isla.

87
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:25,875
Yes. I will look after him.

88
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:27,875
I promise you, Father.

89
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,708
[LWAI] Why are you always
staring outside?

90
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:32,166
Are you looking at the clouds?

91
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:35,375
[SALVA] No. I'm looking
at New Tesla's tower.

92
00:05:35,458 --> 00:05:37,750
The tower? Why?

93
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:41,333
Can I tell you something?
It's about a dream I have.

94
00:05:41,416 --> 00:05:43,708
[LWAI]
Yes, please! Tell me about it.

95
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:48,583
[SALVA] I'll make the throne,
and you'll sit in it.

96
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:51,125
I'll shape the world,
then hand it over to you.

97
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:54,125
What are you talking about?
I don't understand.

98
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:56,291
That will be best.
I'm sure of it.

99
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:58,000
Become king of Isla, Lwai.

100
00:05:58,083 --> 00:06:01,541
It sounds scary! Being the king.

101

[CHRYSLER] I would never have
imagined that Grodia would fall.

Where are the others?

00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:16,916
Are we the only ones
who made it?

106
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,208
I don't see anyone.

107
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:20,125
They must have been
left behind on the bridge.

That sphere touched him.

[K.K.]
He's practically dead.

117

There's no point in

Where did an Islero
robot come from?

And you see who's operating it?

Something's wrong with them.

[CHRYSLER] It's understandable
that he's distraught.

This is his brother.
What do we do?

Go home. What else
can we do now?

that after comin' this far?

Their body temperatures
are scary-low.

Until my brother recovers,

I will be in charge here.
Does everyone understand?

From now on, I speak
with Salva's voice.

139
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:43,083
What he would want, is for
the contest to continue.

140
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:45,291
That's exactly what
I was waitin' to hear.

141
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:47,083
Well that's it, then.

[K.K. grunts]

143
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:51,250
[LWAI] First, we will cross to
Easter Island and find a place

144
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:53,291
for Salva and
the others to rest.

145

Honestly! My poor hair.
What was that sphere-thing?

146
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,250
[LOSER] There are actually
three possibilities.

147
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:07,125
One of them is that
which we desire most,

148
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:08,541
but I can't be certain yet.

149
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:09,875
Hold on a second, Papa.

150
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:12,083
You know what that creepy
thing back there was?

151
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:14,458
[LOSER] I might. But much
is still unclear.

152
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:16,416
The truth is sleeping
at ground zero.

153
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,041
So, is that what
we do now, then?

154
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:19,541
Go to ground zero?

155
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:21,458
[LOSER]
Easier said than done.

Hm?

157
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:30,000
It just turned off!

158
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:32,958
[LOSER] Beyond that is
the void, coils stop working,

159
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:35,666
life itself comes
to a standstill.

160
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:38,625
We have to choose our
route very carefully.

161
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:41,125
[ELIZABETH] But our
destination is right there!

162
00:08:42,541 --> 00:08:45,416
[ELIZABETH] Hm? What? Why are
you looking at me like that?

163
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:48,791
Papa?

164
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:50,791
[LOSER]
Come, Ellie. Let's go.

165
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:51,958
I will do what I must.

166
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:55,000
I have no choice
but to continue.

167
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:09,333
[door creaks]

168
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,791
How is it?

169
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:16,416
I don't see anybody.
And it's still in good shape.

170
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,250
It doesn't look like it got
caught in a protrusion.

171
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,833
Not a sign of life anywhere.

172
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:33,625
[K.K.]
Hm...

173
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:42,916
[K.K.] Well, now that we're here
what's our next step gonna be?

174
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,708
[YURI] First things first.
Let's talk about the reward.

175
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:47,833
No offense, but if your brother
doesn't snap out of it,

176
00:09:47,916 --> 00:09:49,000
who's gonna pay the winner?

177
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:51,125
[LWAI]
I won't answer that question.

178
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:53,291
I'll let Salva do it himself.

179
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:55,791
He took steps to ensure
the contest could continue

180
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:57,583
even in his absence.

181
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:02,125
Greetings, intrepid Collectors,
and welcome to Easter Island.

182
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:04,000
I made this recording
in case unforeseen

183
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:06,166
circumstances should arise.

184
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:08,541
Because on this island,
it's only natural

185
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:10,708
to assume that they will.

186
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:12,458
This is the only
place in the world

187
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:15,000
that has ever fallen
completely into the void.

188
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:18,291
So we have no concept of what
it means to recover from that.

189
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:21,500
Nor do we know how such a thing
could even be made possible.

190
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:28,916
[grunting]

191
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,166
Damn rocks.

192
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:31,750
We might have been better off

193
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:34,083
with a four-wheel drive vehicle
that had a higher suspension.

194
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:35,416
[KYOMA]
Shut up.

195
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,708
Huh?

196
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:39,708
Quick, Kyoma, I think
you'll wanna see this!

197
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:41,333
Even Dr. Yurizaki himself

198
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:44,250
had difficulty theorizing about
the return from the void.

199
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:46,833
So anything we now learn
will be well worth the price

200
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:47,708
we have to pay.

201
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:50,125
Wait, is this broadcasting live?

202
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:58,708
Whew. Getting here sure
wasn't the easiest thing

203
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:02,583
we've ever done, was it,
Brother? Huh? Prince Salva?

204
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:04,458
By this point,
I've already told you

205
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:07,666
what I want you to collect as
well as the reward I'm offering.

206
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,875
That reward remains valid,
even in the event of my death.

207
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:13,333
I'll be monitoring
all of you very closely.

208
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:15,000
So do not attempt
to either run away

209
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:16,625
with the coil or destroy it.

210
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:18,375
[CASSIDY] Come on, Sanchos,
wake up already!

211
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:19,875
We don't have time for sleep!

212
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:24,000
The reward was 50 million.
Even if you split it five ways,

213
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:26,041
that's still ten million
dollars for each of us.

214
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:27,041
You mean work together?

215
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:28,375
I don't think so.

216
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:30,958
I can collect that coil
all on my own, no problem.

217
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:33,083
And I'll save Sanchos,
too, while I'm at it.

218
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:36,375
[CHRYSLER] Good answers.
I was hoping you would say that.

219
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:38,916
There's one more matter
to warn you about.

220
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,083
Dr. Yurizaki speculated that,
once freed from the void,

221
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:44,125
that which was frozen
will regain motion

222
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:46,625
as new possibilities
assert themselves.

223
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:49,791
This applies to living
and non-living entities.

224
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,208
Living beings will
have sustained

225
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:54,166
extensive damage to their cells,
which will likely result

226
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,750
in the significant impairment
of both body and spirit.

227
00:11:56,833 --> 00:11:58,458
Impairment? What's that
supposed to mean?

228
00:11:58,541 --> 00:12:00,208
[MAN moaning]

229
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:01,208
[CHRYSLER]
It's in the basement!

230
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:05,083
[MAN moaning]

231
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:07,500
[CASSIDY]
Is that a zombie?

232
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:10,708
[LWAI]
No, he's just become unfrozen.

233
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:12,708
[CHRYSLER] So, the island
started moving again?

234
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:14,916
Did we trigger it
just by coming here?

235
00:12:16,125 --> 00:12:18,166
[K.K., YURI gasp]

236
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:20,416
[OCTOPUS ROBOT 8A]
Eliminate. Eliminate.

237
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,541
[YURI]
What is that?

238
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:22,791
A robot?

239
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:25,791
We've got another thing
that came back to life?

240
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:26,833
[LWAI]
Hm.

241
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:35,416
[CASSIDY]
Good defense!

242
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,000
[CHRYSLER]
An energy shield.

243
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:39,916
It must've diverted the energy
from impact into Dimension W.

244
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:45,208
The rest of you, go.
Get out of here!

245
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:56,166
[LWAI, CASSIDY panting]

246
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,000
You'll take care of
things here, right?

247
00:12:58,083 --> 00:12:59,958
[CASSIDY]
What? Hey!

248
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,333
Wait a second.
What's he talkin' about?

249
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:05,208
Looks like it's
decided, Cassidy.

250
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:06,250
Huh?

251
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:07,708
We leave this place
in your hands.

252
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:09,291
What the hell're you sayin'?
Where are the other guys?

253
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:12,083
[CHRYSLER] Yuri and K.K. took
off on their own a while ago.

254
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,208
Those cowards,
sneakin' away like that.

255
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:15,666
I'll stay a little longer

256
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:18,166
to watch the prince fight,
but then I'll be going, too.

257
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:18,833
Good luck!

258
00:13:18,916 --> 00:13:20,791
Come back here! You!

00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:27,375
[CASSIDY gasps]

00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:31,666
[LASITHI]
Leave it.

262
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,666
Physical attacks like
that aren't going to

263
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:34,916
do you any good.

264
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,791
It will only cause it
to strike back at you.

265
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:38,333
Just try to stay still.

266
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:41,291
As far as I can tell, it only
seems interested in men.

267
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:47,416
It looks like you
were right. Good call.

268

[MAN moans]

269
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,458
What the hell is that thing?

270
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:04,291
Well, that was unexpected.

271
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:06,333
[LWAI]
All right then.

272
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:11,916
[LWAI]
The sphere again!

273
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:19,583
[LWAI] Good. It seems
no one was harmed.

274
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:21,125
Lasithi, it's me.

275
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:22,375
Yes, Prince Lwai.

00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:24,958
[LWAI] I'm so glad
you're awake! How's Salva?

277
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:28,416
[LASITHI] I'm sorry, Prince
Lwai. He is still insensible.

278
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,208
We were rendered unconscious
by different means.

279
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:33,000
It wasn't the sphere
that knocked me out,

280
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:34,250
but a physical attack.

281
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:36,375
I may be wrong, but it
seemed like the sphere

282
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:38,041
was looking for something.

283
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:39,250
Go now, my prince.

284
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:40,916
You must find out
what that thing is,

285
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,291
and do whatever you can
to save your brother.

Please fight for him.

Okay, I'll do it.

And not just for Salva,
but for Isla and Africa.

you were going to do that!

00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:53,875
Huh?

314
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:55,750
You know, just forget it!

315
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:58,208
[gasps] Be careful.
There's a disturbance.

316
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,958

Too slow! I'm over here now.

[HARRY] Aha! Let's see how it
does with a hole in its head!

327
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,208
Uh?

328
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:36,666
[yelps]

329
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,166
Hey, look out! Above you!

00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:41,208
Gotcha!

[HARRY]
Whoa!

333
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:48,125
That was close.
Are you all right?

334
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:50,000
Phew!

335
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:52,625
[KYOMA] Taking on an armored
robot with a shovel.

336
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:55,000
I don't think I've
seen that one before.

337
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:57,750
Thanks for all the help and
all, sir, but who are you?

338
00:16:57,833 --> 00:17:01,125
Just a Collector who
happened to be in the area.

339
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:03,791
Wow! Not too bad
looking, are you?

340
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:06,916
[MIRA] Oh, I'm Mira, by
the way. Nice to meet you.

341
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,375
Looks like it's getting
ready to attack!

342
00:17:12,541 --> 00:17:13,708
[MIRA]
Take that!

343
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:17,583
Huh. Not too bad, I guess.

344
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:22,166
That won't work. It's shielded!

345
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,166
Yeah, I noticed that.

346
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:37,375
What's he doing?
Are those wires?

347
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:41,500
The shield deflects my
skewers but doesn't detect

348
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:43,041
the wires attached.

349
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:46,166
This robot isn't dexterous
enough to untangle itself.

350
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:48,750
It's not even smart enough
to know it should.

351
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,666
There, I think
that oughta do it.

352
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:09,000
Handsome and smart. Yeah,
I'm in love. He's amazing!

00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:10,458
[KYOMA]
I haven't lost my touch.

354
00:18:10,541 --> 00:18:12,625
That's something, at least.

355
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:14,166
[KYOMA]
Hey, piece of junk.

356
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:15,541
Right!

357
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:19,041
Just give me one second.

358
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,125
I've retrieved the coil.
What do you want me to do now?

359
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:28,291
[KYOMA]
What kind is it?

360
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:29,916
Well, it's pretty old,
but it looks like

361
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,291
a normal coil to me.

362
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:32,458
[KYOMA]
Toss it.

363
00:18:32,541 --> 00:18:34,291
Uh--! But it still
seems to work just fine.

364
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:35,458
You heard me.

365
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:38,708
[MIRA]
Aw. Okay.

366
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:41,791
[KYOMA] There'll be more
where that came from.

367
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:44,000
Assuming we make it
over this protrusion.

368
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:45,333
[MIRA] It doesn't look
like we'll be able

369
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:46,958
to go by car this time.

370
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:49,708
Sure we can. We just have to
find an underground tunnel.

371
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:52,333
And you think there's
one around here?

372
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:53,916
There was five
years ago, at least.

373
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,041
The route we used
on the mission.

374
00:18:57,083 --> 00:18:58,958
[DEBBIE]
Sorry for interrupting.

375
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:00,541
But if it's a tunnel
you're looking for,

376
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:01,916
then maybe we can help.

377
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
See, we're pretty good
at digging holes.

378
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:05,750

Mm-hm! Mm-hm!

and I'll blow you to pieces!

What'd you do to me?

384
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:27,791
[K.K.] I've been waiting
this whole time

385
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:30,875
to get one of you alone.
It took longer than I thought.

386
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:33,166
Wait, stop.

387
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:36,916
Don't worry.
It's a simple operation.

388
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:42,375
[DEBBIE]
Ha, ha!

389

Whoa!

390
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:49,958
[KYOMA] Damn it. This is
wrong. Just plain wrong.

391
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:51,083
Well, what else
could we do?

392
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:52,625
There are only two seats.

393
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:54,000
They did find the tunnel for us,

394
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:55,375
so I think we
owe them, don't you?

395
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:56,625
[KYOMA grunts]

396
00:19:56,708 --> 00:19:58,250
Personally, I like the
way things turned out.

397
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:00,125
We're all in this together now!

398
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:02,625
Tch. When I find that
coil, I'm not planning

399
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:06,458
to hand it over to anyone, and I
won't let it go without a fight.

400
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:09,000
I will destroy it. It will
never function again.

401
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:11,000
You have any idea where it is?

402
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:15,166
If I did, I'd be a lot
more relaxed right now.

403
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:17,583
Kyoma, in 600 meters
we'll reach an area

404
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:22,125
of total darkness and it will
continue for roughly 800 meters.

405
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:23,041
The void.

406
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:25,125
Yes, that does seem likely.

407
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:27,625
The car will be fine,
but we humans won't.

408
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:30,458
We've got ten or 20
seconds at the most.

409
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:32,750
You'll wanna hang on
tight up there.

Whoa!

Four hundred... Two hundred...

Very soon, all coils will
stop working. Including mine.

413
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:43,375
I'm frightened.

414
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:45,958
I'll enter a death state inside
the void, and that scares me.

415
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:49,916
I mean it, Kyoma.
I'm very anxious. I--

416
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:54,041
[KYOMA] Robots shouldn't
have anxiety issues.

417

You're over-programmed.

418
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:02,250
[KYOMA] It's like all the blood
is draining from my body.

419
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:06,916
My arms and legs are numb.
Very soon. I'll be unconscious.

Uh. I'll try to.
Do I still have legs?

I'm scared of dying,
just like everybody else,

so this will be
difficult for me, too!

00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:38,125
Um, Kyoma.
You're not in the car.

431
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:39,916
So, everyone made it then.

You were worried about me?

Why would I be?

So many robots destroyed.

435

[KYOMA] It's proof that
Grendel came through here.

436

Just a little farther now.

And then we'll be
at ground zero.

That's right.

439

We're about to
visit the birthplace

440

of Easter Island's destruction.

441
00:21:55,708 --> 00:21:57,375
What kind of a facility was it?

442
00:21:57,458 --> 00:21:59,250
Honestly, there isn't
much I can remember

443
00:21:59,333 --> 00:22:01,250
about the place.

444
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:03,541
Except for one thing:
It was called Adrastea.

445
00:22:03,625 --> 00:22:06,041
That's an unusual name.

446
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:08,875
[KYOMA] That's what the
commander called it, anyway.

447
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:14,125
Well, none of the
robots are operational,

448
