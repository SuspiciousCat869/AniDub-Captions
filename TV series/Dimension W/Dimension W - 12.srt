1
00:00:12,125 --> 00:00:15,083
[LWAI]
Salva! What is that thing?

2
00:00:15,166 --> 00:00:16,541
[LOSER]
This is Sophia?

3
00:00:16,625 --> 00:00:18,125
[SEAMEYER] Technically,
it's a monster created

4
00:00:18,208 --> 00:00:22,541
from a bunch of corpses,
using Sophia as its foundation.

5
00:00:22,625 --> 00:00:23,791
He's lying...

6
00:00:23,875 --> 00:00:24,666
[SEAMEYER] If it's any
consolation, some parts

7
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:26,916
of her body are still alive.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,125
Her heart, for example.
And her hands.

9
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:31,291
The transporter requires

10
00:00:31,375 --> 00:00:33,375
biometric authentication
for it to work,

11
00:00:33,458 --> 00:00:35,708
so I hung onto
the necessary bits.

12
00:00:35,791 --> 00:00:38,041
You're in quite a
predicament now, Julian.

13
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:39,750
If only you had Genesis.

14
00:00:39,833 --> 00:00:43,083
You could fully rematerialize
her with memories intact.

15
00:00:43,166 --> 00:00:44,583
So, you have a choice.

16
00:00:44,666 --> 00:00:47,541
Work with me, or join your
wife in the other world.

17
00:00:47,625 --> 00:00:50,208
Which one will you choose?

18
00:00:50,291 --> 00:00:52,041
[LOSER] You think those
are my only options?

19
00:00:52,125 --> 00:00:55,041
That's where you're wrong.
First I'll defeat you.

20
00:00:55,125 --> 00:00:57,666
And then I'll take
Genesis for myself.

21
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,875
Ha! Oh, really?

22
00:00:59,958 --> 00:01:01,500
[LOSER]
I will save Sophia.

23
00:01:01,583 --> 00:01:03,250
And restore the
honor of Adrastea,

24
00:01:03,333 --> 00:01:06,000
which was blamed for
the war that you started!

25
00:01:06,083 --> 00:01:08,416
I can't wait to see you try!

26
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,875
[LOSER] I know your weakness
and how to exploit it.

27
00:01:10,958 --> 00:01:12,750
There are limits to
what you can do.

28
00:01:12,833 --> 00:01:15,500
You can't close
that gate, or move it.

29
00:01:15,583 --> 00:01:17,458
Do that, and you'll
really be lost.

30
00:01:17,541 --> 00:01:19,375
The transporter will
disappear from your side

31
00:01:19,458 --> 00:01:20,541
and you'll be stuck for good.

32
00:01:20,625 --> 00:01:22,250
Hurry up and get to the point!

33
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:24,041
[LOSER]
I have all five Numbers now.

34
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:25,666
Do you know what that means?

35
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:28,250
It means I can open up
a gate of my own.

36
00:01:28,333 --> 00:01:29,583
Go on, Papa, do it!

37
00:01:29,666 --> 00:01:30,583
[gasps]

38
00:01:30,666 --> 00:01:33,958
[gate static]

39
00:01:34,041 --> 00:01:36,291
[SEAMEYER]
He's opening a gate here?

40
00:01:36,375 --> 00:01:37,708
It won't do any good.

41
00:01:37,791 --> 00:01:40,416
Neither you nor Sophia's heart
will be able to return.

42
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,125
[LOSER]
That's why...

43
00:01:42,208 --> 00:01:44,291
[grunts]

44
00:01:44,375 --> 00:01:45,791
[LOSER] ...I'll settle
for bringing you through

45
00:01:45,875 --> 00:01:47,541
to this side instead.

46
00:01:47,625 --> 00:01:50,083
Have a taste of the pain
you inflicted on the people

47
00:01:50,166 --> 00:01:53,125
whose lives you
gleefully sacrificed!

48
00:01:57,666 --> 00:02:00,125
Julian.

49
00:02:00,208 --> 00:02:03,041
[LOSER]
Sophia...

50
00:02:03,125 --> 00:02:05,166
[LOSER groans]

51
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,541
[LOSER groans]

52
00:02:08,833 --> 00:02:11,416
[SEAMEYER cackles]
You let yourself be distracted

53
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,416
by such an obvious fake?
How pathetic!

54
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,583
Papa! Say something!

55
00:02:16,666 --> 00:02:18,333
You made the wrong
choice, Julian.

56
00:02:18,416 --> 00:02:21,583
You could've cooperated with me,
but now, it's too late.

57
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,541
Onto the next
order of business.

58
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:28,833
I'm coming for you,
Kyoma Mabuchi!

59
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,541
[MIRA]
Can you get up?


60
00:02:32,625 --> 00:02:34,083
[KYOMA]
Why bother? It's over.


61
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:37,250
I had no right to any of
this in the first place.


62
00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:39,375
I didn't deserve to
come home again.

63
00:02:39,458 --> 00:02:42,750
I wasn't worthy to return and
stand before Miyabi's grave.

64
00:02:42,833 --> 00:02:46,625
I couldn't save anybody.
Except my own sorry self.

65
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,583
I don't understand why
you're acting like this.

66
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:51,375
Wallowing in self-pity
isn't like you, Kyoma.

67
00:02:51,458 --> 00:02:52,541
You should stop talking.

68
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:54,250
[MIRA] You should
pull yourself together!

69
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:57,208
The Kyoma I know is violent,
rash, and blunt.

70
00:02:57,291 --> 00:02:58,541
He acts without thinking.

71
00:02:58,625 --> 00:03:00,125
He makes no apologies to anyone.

72
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:02,375
And he is always
true to himself.

73
00:03:02,458 --> 00:03:06,041
Even though he hates coils,
he saved a robot from the void.

74
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:08,750
It hasn't even been six
months since we first met.

75
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:10,166
I may not know
everything about you,

76
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:11,541
but some things I do.

77
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:14,791
And one is that you're a
person who never gives up!

78
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:16,750
Not as long as there
is a possibility!

79
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:17,916
Be quiet!

80
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,416
All this is the result
of me holding onto

81
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,250
a possibility that's not real!

82
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:23,875
[MIRA] What happened here
wasn't your fault.

83
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:26,208
[KYOMA] You don't get it.
I remember now.

84
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:27,958
I know what happened.

85
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:33,125
[KYOMA] With this coil,
anything could be possible.

86
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:34,833
That's what I thought
to myself when I held

87
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:38,291
Genesis in my hand
that day. With it,

88
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:42,375
Miyabi could truly be saved.
She could be made whole again.

89
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:44,083
That's when I made my decision.

90
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:46,416
I would bring Genesis
with me through the gate.

91
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,291
For Miyabi's sake.

92
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:51,083
Even if I died and my
body was torn to pieces.

93
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:52,375
There was still a
chance that the coil

94
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:54,458
could be used to help her.

95
00:03:54,541 --> 00:03:56,541
That's what I believed,
the reason I jumped.

96
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:59,625
We know how well
that turned out!

97
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:02,375
Next thing I knew,
I was in the hospital.

98
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:05,125
Miyabi was dead, and my
comrades had been annihilated.

99
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:06,291
Couldn't remember what happened,

100
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:08,541
but I was certain
coils were to blame.

101
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:10,375
They'd taken everything from me.

102
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,625
That's the lie I kept
telling myself.

103
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:14,416
That's awful. I'm sorry.

104
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,416
[KYOMA] I don't know what
it is you want me to do,

105
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,500
but I can't do it. I don't
have power over possibility.

106
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:22,208
So save your pep talks
for someone else.

107
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,125
[MIRA] What now? You're just
going to run away?

108
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:26,500
[KYOMA]
Why should I stay?

109
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:28,375
There's nothing on this
island for me to fight for.

110
00:04:28,458 --> 00:04:31,208
That's not what I mean.
I'm talking about Miyabi.

111
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:32,458
[KYOMA]
Huh?

112
00:04:32,541 --> 00:04:34,000
[MIRA] The accident during
Miyabi's operation

113
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:35,250
happened at the same time

114
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:37,625
as the destruction
of Easter Island.

115
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:40,666
That's always bothered
you. Hasn't it?

116
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,291
[KYOMA] That doesn't have
anything to do with you!

117
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:43,791
[MIRA]
Yes it does!

118
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:45,083
Will you please listen to me?

119
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:47,416
My body was originally
created for Miyabi.

120
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,791
Which means if she were
still alive, I wouldn't be here,

121
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:51,458
not in the form that I am now.

122
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,750
If it weren't for you,
I would never have been made.

123
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:56,041
I was born because you and
she chose the possibility

124
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:57,625
of giving her a new body.

125
00:04:57,708 --> 00:05:00,041
So I would say this has
a lot to do with me!

126
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:00,916
Wouldn't you?

127
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,250
[grunts] What do you want?

128
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:04,958
You still don't
remember everything.

129
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:07,166
Let me help. Let me honor Miyabi

130
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,416
and the possibility
that she believed in.

131
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,916
What would she want you to do?

132
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,125
Are you going to give up
or keep fighting?

133
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:14,916
[grunting]

134
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,458
[MIYABI]
Don't worry, it'll be okay.

135
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:19,291
Whatever happens, I'm on your
side and I always will be.

136
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:21,083
Hey, Kyo. Thanks for waiting.

137
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:23,916
Before you go, my name
is Miyabi Azumaya.

138
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,083
[pants]

139
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:29,416
[MIRA grunts]

140
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,541
[MIRA]
Uh? Hey. What are you doing?

141
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:33,500
That's my hand. Kyoma!

142
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:34,833
Damn. You're identical.

143
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:37,041
Right down to the
lines on your palm.

144
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:39,291
[gasps]

145
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:40,375
[KYOMA]
All right.

146
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:42,541
How do you plan to
help me remember?

147
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:44,166
I suspect your
memory was damaged

148
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:46,625
as a result of your
interaction with Genesis.

149
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:48,791
Something broke in the
memory center of your brain.

150
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:49,875
There was just
too much happening

151
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:51,125
that it couldn't process.

152
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:53,375
So I should just need
to fix what was broken.

153
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:55,666
Hey, I'm not a robot.
I can't just be "fixed."

154
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,000
[MIRA]
There must be a way to do it,

155
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:59,791
otherwise, why would
Seameyer be targeting you?

156
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:02,083
What's broken is the link
between your memories.

157
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:04,083
If I can successfully
repair that connection,

158
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:06,333
you should remember everything.

159
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:07,916
[KYOMA]
How will you do it?

160
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,666
By simply tracing your memories
and knitting them back together.

161
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,750
I analyzed the device
that Seameyer teleported

162
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:15,291
into your ear, so I can
use that as a reference.

163
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,375
I learned some things

164
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:18,083
from my experience
in Yasogami, too.

165
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:20,833
Don't worry. I feel very
confident I can do this.

166
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:23,875
[sighs] All right.
How do we get started?

167
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:25,416
Well, about that...

168
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,958
I'll have to put you into a
deep sleep, which may require--

169
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:29,583
[KYOMA]
You can stop right there.

170
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:30,958
I know what to expect.

171
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:33,583
You've put me to sleep before.
Don't you remember?

172
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:34,916
Yes, I do.

173
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,500
How could I forget the
first time we met, Kyoma?

174
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:39,125
This will be a little like that.

175
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:40,750
[cracking]

176
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:42,083
[snaps]

177
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:44,125
[MIRA]
All right. Begin tracing.

178
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:49,750
[KYOMA]
What is all this?

179
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:52,500
[MIRA] Oh, so you can see
what's going on, too?

180
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:54,333
[KYOMA]
These fragments are my memories?

181
00:06:54,416 --> 00:06:56,750
[MIRA] Yes, but they've been
scattered, as you can see.

182
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,666
If I can reestablish
the links between them,

183
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,250
they should be restored.

184
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:03,125
Are you going to
continue hiding?

185
00:07:03,208 --> 00:07:06,708
Then I'll just have to find
you by tracing your memories.

186
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:12,625
One way or another,
I'll get what I came for.

187
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:14,458
Now, where are you?

188
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:18,875
[cackles]

189
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:21,333
[MIRA] Dimension W lies
beyond the third dimension.

190
00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:23,125
It's difficult to access.

191
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:25,208
In order for this to work,
I have to be very aware

192
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:26,375
of Kyoma's memories.

193
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:27,416
[grunts]

194
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,041
[KYOMA]
What's wrong, piece of junk.

195
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:30,375
Don't worry. It's nothing.

196
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:32,458
There was just some strain
on the coil, that's all.

197
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:33,666
[KYOMA]
Are you sure?

198
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,500
The lines on your body
are turning red.

199
00:07:35,583 --> 00:07:38,208
[MIRA] It'll be all right.
We're almost there now.

200
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:42,583
[MIRA] The preparations
to connect are complete.

201
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:43,916
[KYOMA]
All right. Do it!

202
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,083
Okay!

203
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:50,666
Go on, Mabuchi, do it.

204
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,500
[SOPHIA] It's too powerful!
No one can have it!

205
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:53,791
Kyoma!

206
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:55,583
[KYOMA] These are memories
from that day.

207
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:59,666
Images of people in different
places, all overlapping.

208
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:02,250
[KYOMA yelling]

209
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:06,208
[KYOMA] The island.
It's being swallowed up.

210
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:09,166
[MIYABI]
Kyo?

211
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:10,708
[gasps]

212
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:13,000
[KYOMA]
The hospital?

213
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:14,958
[SEIRA] Impossible!
The transplant operation

214
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:17,958
went perfectly. Why is she
on the verge of death?

215
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:19,083
[KYOMA]
On the verge of death?

216
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:20,333
[DOCTOR 12A]
Doctor!

217
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:22,291
We're getting abnormal
readings from the coil.

218
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:23,958
Her consciousness
is dissipating.

219
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:25,750
It's flowing away from the coil.

220
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:27,125
Does this mean that
the brain alone

221
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:29,666
isn't enough to
hold onto the soul?

222
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,166
[DOCTOR 12D] Hurry,
Dr. Seira. We need to run!

223
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,166
[KYOMA] Damn it! Why can't
I get any closer?

224
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:35,583
[DOCTOR 12A]
The coil's at its limit!

225
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:37,708
We can't hold it back.

226
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:38,916
[KYOMA]
I know!

227
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,583
I have to find a way to
get Genesis to them.

228
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:44,958
With this, they could do it.

229
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:46,708
They could save her!

230
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:50,000
[gasps]

231
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:55,500
Is it really you?

232
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:56,750
[inaudible]

233
00:08:56,833 --> 00:09:01,750
[KYOMA] It's too much.
The world is breaking?

234
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:05,083
So. You want me to...?

235
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:13,541
It's the right thing
to do. Isn't it?

236
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:19,875
All right.

237
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:22,916
[inaudible]

238
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,500
[KYOMA grunts]

239
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:35,208
[KYOMA gasps]

240
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,125
Miyabi, I...

241
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:47,375
This is how it should be.

242
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:53,500
Thank you. I'm glad it
was you. Goodbye, Kyoma.

243
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:58,333
[KYOMA] Yes. That's right.
That's what happened.

244
00:09:58,416 --> 00:10:00,791
It wasn't just me.

245
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:03,208
We made the decision together.

246
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,458
[KYOMA]
I can remember all of it now.

247
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:11,000
And I'm glad I can remember.

248
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:13,458
[KYOMA]
That's enough.

249
00:10:13,541 --> 00:10:16,041
You can wake me
up now, I'm ready.

250
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:19,916
Where'd you go?
Hey. Piece of junk?

251
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:24,333
[KYOMA grunts]
Damn it.

252
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:26,333
Gotta stop punching
myself in my dreams.

253
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:28,375
Doesn't feel too good.

254
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:32,958
[KYOMA]
She's gone and I think know why.

255
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:41,333
Hey, Kyoma! Doin' okay?

256
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:44,666
--Fine. You guys all right?
--[DEBBIE] And up we go!

257
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:47,166
[KYOMA] Your Highness.
I'm glad you made it.

258
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:48,916
I very nearly didn't.

259
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,708
Fortunately, these two
were there to save me.

260
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:53,916
Loo, everyone's all right here.

261
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,833
[LWAI sighs]
What a relief!

262
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:57,333
[SALVA] We're alive,
but we're not any closer

263
00:10:57,416 --> 00:10:58,833
to solving our problem.

264
00:10:58,916 --> 00:11:01,791
That monster of his is enormous.
How can we defeat it?

265
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:04,125
[KYOMA] I've got an
idea that might work.

266
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:09,541
[LOSER]
You think we should tie it up.

267
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:11,666
Yes, that would be effective.

268
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,500
Provided we're able to
pull it off, of course.

269
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:15,125
[SALVA]
You're still alive.

270
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:17,541
[LOSER] There should be the
cable of a particle accelerator

271
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:20,416
buried around the outer
circumference of Adrastea.

272
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,291
I think that would
suit our purpose.

273
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:24,000
Well, if digging
is what you need,

274
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:25,291
we're here to help!

275
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:28,166
[LWAI] Then I can use my
Ras Dashen to carry it.

276
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:29,625
[LOSER]
All right.

277
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:32,208
But how do we get Seameyer
to stand still long enough?

278
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:33,958
He wants to know where
Genesis is, right?

279
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:35,708
Let's give him what he wants.

280
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:41,083
[MIRA panting]
This coil is about to go wild.

281
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:43,625
I have to get as far
from Kyoma as I can.

282
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:46,791
Or he'll be caught up in the
materialization of Dimension W.

283
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:49,750
[yelps]

284
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:52,666
[SEAMEYER cackles]
I finally caught one of them!

285
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,833
Now, let's see my prize.

286
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:56,625
Huh?

287
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:57,500
[yelps]

288
00:11:57,583 --> 00:12:00,041
It's not human. This is a robot.

289
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:01,541
They've made a lot
of advancements

290
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:04,166
since I've been gone.

291
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:05,291
Right, I remember now.

292
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:07,250
Yurizaki's wife
was into robotics.

293
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:10,750
That explains it. Hello, robot.
I'm going to take you apart

294
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:12,708
and use you to make
my arms and legs.

295
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:14,208
Since you're not alive,

296
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:17,166
you can move in and
out through the gate.

297
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:18,625
[MIRA] He hasn't noticed
how close my coil

298
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:21,125
is to going out of control.
I could get closer

299
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:24,041
to the center of the system
and let it go wild.

300
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:26,125
If I did that,
I could save everyone.

301
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:28,250
No one else would
have to get hurt.

302
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:30,958
[KYOMA] Easy, now.
Don't do anything stupid.

303
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:36,541
Well. Hello again, Seameyer.

304
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:38,791
Mabuchi! You're here!

305
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:40,041
So, what are you waiting for?

306
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:42,333
I've got what you want.
Just come and get it.

307
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:45,250
What are you doing here?
No, never mind. Just leave, now!

308
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:45,958
My coil's going--

309
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:47,416
[KYOMA]
Be quiet.

310
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,541
Nobody's expecting you
to sacrifice yourself.

311
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:51,083
Just let me take care of this.

312
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:52,666
[MIRA]
But what about the coil?

313
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:55,833
Gonna need you to deal with it

me caught up in it.

I'm sick of running.
I don't wanna do it anymore.

316
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:03,541
If you wanna see my memory,
I'll show it to you.

317

You're planning
something. What is it?

[KYOMA]
Aw, what's wrong, Seameyer?

319
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:08,666
Are you scared?

320
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:11,083
Are you afraid to learn where
your prized possession is?

321
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:12,875
I thought you were dying
to know what happened.

322

Who I gave Genesis to.

323

[SEAMEYER] You gave my
coil to somebody else?

324

Show me! Let me
into your memory!

325
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:23,958
All right, He took the bait!

326
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:27,041
[SEAMEYER pants]
Where is it? Where's Genesis?

[KYOMA] Take a look.
It's been me the whole time.

have it, though.

[screams]

333
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:48,541
I considered using it,
but I didn't.

334
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:51,000
Miyabi and I decided
that nobody should.

335
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:54,291
Not ever. That's why
I destroyed it.

336
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,125
The shock from the
destruction of Genesis

337
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:57,875
must have sent me
back to the island.

338
00:13:57,958 --> 00:13:59,375
That moment is lost
forever, though.

339
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:02,041
I don't think anybody
could restore it.

340
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:03,500
You created something amazing.

341
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:06,500
There's no denying that.
Truly amazing.

342
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:08,458
But it will never be used again.

343
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:10,500
It's gone, and
that's the reality.

344
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:13,500
You have to accept it.
And so do I.

[SEAMEYER screaming]
There was no reason!

350

My whole life was pointless!

00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,250
This is the end of everything!

352
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:37,208
I have no need for a planet
I can't return to.

353
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:38,375
I'll destroy it!

354
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:40,791
I'll trigger
materialization so massive,

355
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:43,750
it will swallow up the Earth
and kill everything on it!

356
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:46,791
The whole planet will be a void!

Was this your plan Julian?

There's still one thing
I wanna say to you

before this is over.

371
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:38,750
[KYOMA] Why do you like those
things so much, anyway?

What's so great about 'em?

373
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:44,125
[MIYABI] Mm... I just think
there's something special

374
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:47,000
about stuff people leave behind.

375
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:48,708
It's proof of the
lives they've lived.

376
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:52,166
Like parts of them remain
even after they're gone.

377
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:53,541
It might sound silly to you,

378
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:55,625
but by treasuring the past,
we can make the present

379
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:57,875
shine even brighter.

380
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:00,250
Our lives are full of
failures and tragedies.

381
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:02,750
But each one is the source
of a new possibility.

382
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:04,541
What you did was truly horrible.

383
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:07,208
And I lost everything in the
world that was dear to me.

384
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:09,041
But do you know what?

385
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:11,625
If that hadn't happened,
there are possibilities

386
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:14,500
that wouldn't have
been realized.

387
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:19,083
So I don't have any regrets.
And I'm not giving up.

[MIYABI]
You know what I hope?

I hope that someday
I get to be somebody's

precious memory. I like that.

Because it means that I'll
help create the future!

Nothing that either of
us did was pointless.

We'll have a funeral
for the dead.

472
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:54,666
And good wine for the living.

473
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:59,166
[CASSIDY gasps] That was close!
I thought I was a goner!

474
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:00,583
[SANCHOS grunts]

475
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:07,666
[zipping]

476
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:08,875
That was it, wasn't it?

477
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:11,208
The last battle of our
war has been fought.

478
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:12,541
[KYOMA]
Yeah.

479
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:29,208
[KYOMA]
Thanks for your help, Mira.

480
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:30,958
[gasps]

481
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:36,416
Sure.

482
00:21:37,791 --> 00:21:38,833
[KYOMA]
Let's go home.

483
00:21:38,916 --> 00:21:41,250
[MIRA]
Okay. Oh. Kyoma, wait.

484
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:43,625
Look up there.
On top of that hill!

485
00:21:43,708 --> 00:21:45,666
At the bottom right
of the Moai statue.

486
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:48,125
There's a flower blooming. See?

487
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:49,916
[KYOMA]
I don't have robot eyes.

488
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,833
[MIRA]
Ah!

489
00:21:51,916 --> 00:21:54,166
The void's gone now, remember?

490
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:57,041
No surprise that flowers
have started to bloom.

491
00:22:03,291 --> 00:22:05,166
[KYOMA]
Thank you, Miyabi.

492
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:44,875
[KYOMA] This is how I am,
how I've always been.

493
00:23:44,958 --> 00:23:47,125
Trouble and danger
come looking for me.

494
00:23:47,208 --> 00:23:48,166
Like I'm some kinda magnet.

495
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:49,708
[MAN 12A]
Yee-ha, ha, ha!

496
00:23:49,791 --> 00:23:51,291
[MARY]
Don't screw up, you two.

497
00:23:51,375 --> 00:23:52,916
This guy is bad news.

498
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,791
He's already killed
three people.

499
00:23:54,875 --> 00:23:56,666
[KOOROGI] His left arm
is completely mechanized,

500
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:59,291
and his bottom half has
a reinforced exoskeleton.

501
00:23:59,375 --> 00:24:01,166
Won't be easy to take him down.

502
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:02,625
[chuckles]

503
00:24:02,708 --> 00:24:04,708
[KYOMA] Probably would've
turned out even worse,

504
00:24:04,791 --> 00:24:07,708
if Miyabi hadn't come along
to give me a new path.

505
00:24:07,791 --> 00:24:10,708
Get ready! He's headed your way.

506
00:24:10,791 --> 00:24:13,250
[KYOMA] That's why I'm
gonna keep doing this job.

507
00:24:13,333 --> 00:24:15,708
New paths. New possibilities.

508
00:24:15,791 --> 00:24:19,291
Besides, this is what
I am: a Collector.
