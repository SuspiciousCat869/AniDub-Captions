[KYOMA] Aw, man. Didn't even
get to drink half of it.

00:00:26,125 --> 00:00:28,125
[KYOMA]
I met her by chance.

00:00:28,208 --> 00:00:30,333
It could easily
never have happened.

Stupid rain!

[MIYABI]
Excuse me.

7
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:38,166
[KYOMA]
What was that?

8
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:40,750
[MIYABI]
Over here!

9
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:43,958
I'm sorry, but do you think
you could help me, please?

10
00:00:44,833 --> 00:00:47,958
[SHIDO] Dimension W contains
infinite nothingness

11
00:00:48,041 --> 00:00:51,791
and infinite energy,
simultaneously both and neither

12
00:00:51,875 --> 00:00:55,041
until it comes into
contact with our world.

13
00:00:55,125 --> 00:00:57,125
It exists in a state
of pure potential,

14
00:00:57,208 --> 00:00:59,875
what we call a
"wave of possibility."

15
00:00:59,958 --> 00:01:03,166
But why do coils only
draw out electric energy?

16
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:05,500
I say it's not that
they can't do more,

17
00:01:05,583 --> 00:01:07,958
but that we've not
yet asked them.

18
00:01:08,041 --> 00:01:10,666
The coils we use have
been specifically designed

19
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:14,125
to extract electric energy
from Dimension W.

20
00:01:14,208 --> 00:01:18,208
But in truth, coil technology
and Dimension W itself

21
00:01:18,291 --> 00:01:20,458
contain infinite possibilities.

22
00:01:20,541 --> 00:01:24,000
Possibilities beyond
our wildest imagination!

23
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:57,166
What're you doing in there?
Are you stuck?


24
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:00,541
[MIYABI] Yeah. I can't climb
out. I can barely even move.


25
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:02,708
How did you wind
up there, anyway?

26
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:04,041
I was clumsy.

27
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:05,916
There was this cat I wanted
to get a picture of,

28
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,833
so I climbed the wall.
But I kinda fell.

29
00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:12,791
[KYOMA]
Hold on. I'll get you out.

30
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:16,500
[pants] Thank you so
much for helping me.

31
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:18,791
Who knows how long I
could've been stuck there?

32
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:20,708
You should try to
be more careful.

33
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:22,458
So you really use that camera?

34
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:23,541
Uh-huh!

35
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:24,833
It looks like it's
seen better days.

36
00:03:24,916 --> 00:03:26,458
It belonged to my grandfather.

37
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:29,458
He left it to me because
I like old things.

40
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:37,208
See ya.

41
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:39,125
Hey! Wait a sec!

42
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:42,041
Before you go, my name
is Miyabi Azumaya.

And what about you?
What's yours?

44

My name? It's Kyoma.

45
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:51,166
[MIYABI]
Hey, Kyo. Thanks for waiting.

46
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:55,041
[KYOMA] Sure. That beat-up
old thing again?

47
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:57,000
Yeah, but you shouldn't
say it like that.

48
00:03:57,083 --> 00:03:59,958
This "beat-up old thing"
brought us together.

49
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:01,625
So I don't care if
it's falling apart

50
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:03,375
and doesn't take good pictures,

51
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:06,458
or if it's practically
impossible to find film for it.

52

This camera is
my good luck charm!

It's so outdated, though.

You know, she only gets so angry

because she's worried about you.

one she's worried about,

spending all your time
with somebody like me.

66

She worries about both of us.
But she approves of you.

Despite the fact that you're
always getting in trouble.

Big trouble this time.

[KYOMA] She was diagnosed
with an incurable disease

the muscles in her body

00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:54,625
From what I've learned, I would
say you've qualified to join.

Don't say anything yet.
Let me finish.

143
00:07:57,666 --> 00:08:00,166
Do you know who proposed
the formation of Grendel?

144
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:03,125
His name is Dr. Shido Yurizaki,
and he happens to be

Dr. Seira's husband.

146
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:06,916
If you join, I'm sure
the doctor would be willing

147
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,875
to speak to his wife
on your behalf

148

and explain your
situation to her.

I bet you could even get
your girlfriend priority

I have found a possibility.

Easter Island was cut off

00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:39,541
Because I don't know
who can be trusted,

281
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:42,791
considering that the ones
responsible for the last war

282
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:45,250
and the assassination
of the Yurizaki family

283
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:46,833
came from within the company.

[SALVA]
I understand.

The real goal of my strategy
is to promote unity.

everything that happens

[PRESIDENT 7A] I see. I believe
I understand your intentions.

00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:12,750
It is somewhat unorthodox,
but I'm willing to concede

294
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:16,708
that you have the

thank you for coming.

315
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:08,833
The fact that you've
received an invitation,

316
00:16:08,916 --> 00:16:11,083
understood its import,
and were courageous enough

317
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:14,333
to come here proves that you
are the crème de la crème.

318
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:15,875
[HARRY, DEBBIE munching]

319
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:18,375
[DEBBIE] Just the kinda grub
I'd expect at a swanky hotel!

320
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:24,458
We done talking?

321
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:30,083
Ha. I don't know what
kinda job we're here for,

322
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:33,583
but I'm sure I could handle
it just fine on my own.

323
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:37,208
[K.K.]
Hmph.

324
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:40,958
[CASSIDY] Wouldja hurry up and
get to the good stuff, already?

325
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:43,208
We all know this
ain't a regular job.

326
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:45,750
So tell us what you're after.

327
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:48,125
As you are all aware,
five years ago,

328
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:51,041
Easter Island fell into
the void of possibility.

329
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:53,000
No doubt you're also
aware that coils

330
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:54,791
do not work in the void.

331
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:57,500
And yet, in that wasteland,
a coil began working.

332
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:58,916
[DEBBIE]
Well, okay.

333
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,416
[SALVA] Ever since that first
coil came back to life,

334
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:04,208
the dimensional energy of the
island has begun to recover.

335
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:05,916
That particular
coil is the reason

336
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,875
I have summoned you here today.

337
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:12,000
I am challenging you all to
enter the void and collect it.

338
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:15,125
I believe you will be able to
tell which one it is on sight.

339
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:17,875
I'm offering a reward
of 50 million dollars.

340
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:19,000
Fifty million? No way!

341
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:20,416
[SALVA]
First to the coil gets paid.

342
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,666
That's five times the
underground price for Numbers.

343
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,833
For 50 million dollars,
I have no problem

344
00:17:24,916 --> 00:17:26,208
risking life and limb.

345
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:28,500
There is one more thing
you should know.

346
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:33,958
[SALVA] May I present our
transport to Easter Island?

347
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:35,583
That's the air
command ship Grodia

348
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:38,583
from South America's Qi-4.

349
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:40,333
[CHRYSLER]
And the commanding officer.

350
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:43,416
Cedric Morgan.
As brave as they come.

351
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,333
We will be departing tomorrow.

352
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:48,750
Until then, get your rest.
I think you'll need it.

353
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,041
[sighs]

354
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:53,458
I like this disguise.

355
00:17:53,541 --> 00:17:56,458
I'm already getting used to it.

356
00:17:56,541 --> 00:17:58,500
Papa, is there
something the matter?

357
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:01,250
[LOSER]
No, It's nothing.

358
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:04,291
I just can't believe
that Beast isn't here.

359
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:09,000
[ALBERT] Took you long enough,
but I'm glad you decided to go.

360
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:10,583
Yeah, thanks for
givin' us a lift.

361
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:12,833
We'll add it to the growing
list of favors you owe me.

362
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:16,000
I'll pay my tab in full
at some point, don't worry.

363
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:17,625
If it weren't outside
my jurisdiction,

364
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:20,541
I'd be doing more than
just flying you out there.

365
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:22,875
You'll give me a report
when it's over, though?

366
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:24,500
A full report.

367
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:26,208
Yeah.

368
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:27,541
[ALBERT] I still don't
get why you didn't just

369
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:29,458
go with Prince Salva
and the others.

370
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:31,416
It would've been faster, right?

371
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,583
[KYOMA] But I wouldn't've
been able to bring my car.

372
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:34,875
[ALBERT]
So you're seriously planning to

373
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:37,083
drive around the
island in that car?

374
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:40,166
[KYOMA] Heh. It's all
about speed this time.

375
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:41,916
You don't think you
move fast enough?

376
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,083
There's a price to pay
for not using coils.

377
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:46,291
It means I'll just be slower
than other Collectors.

378
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,833
That's just a fact.

379
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:50,916
No matter what the prince is
after, if it's on Easter Island,

380
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,041
there's only one place
we'd be heading.

381
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:55,041
The site of the former
New Tesla Energy

382
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:58,541
experiment facilities.
Also known as ground zero.

383
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:00,500
What do you mean
ground zero?

384
00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:02,458
[KYOMA]
Show the map.

385
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:04,833
[ALBERT] The place where the
biggest dimensional malfunction

386
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:08,666
in history occurred. There's one
runway on Easter Island.

387
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:11,875
It's 12 kilometers away from
that as the crow flies.

388
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:14,125
[KYOMA] But it's 12 kilometers
of rough terrain,

389
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:16,625
thanks to protrusions
caused by the malfunction.

390
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:19,625
I'll take a route that
goes around the island.

391
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:22,541
The drive oughtta take me
less than 30 minutes.

392
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:24,625
[ALBERT] You still need
to be careful, though.

393
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:27,458
That car of yours will be
able to function in the void,

394
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,625
but of course, your
partner will shut down.

395
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:33,458
And it's not likely you'll
be unaffected, either.

396
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:35,083
It's not gonna be a cakewalk.

397
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:36,708
I'm aware of that.

398
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:43,791
[TROOPER 7A] Wind speed 22
meters per second, altitude 700.

399
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:45,500
We'll be entering the
automated defense line

400
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:47,000
before much longer.

401
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:50,541
We're getting close now.

402
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:52,458
That's excellent, Commander.

403
00:19:57,250 --> 00:20:00,041
What a huge storm!
It's raining cats and dogs.

404
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:01,333
[HARRY]
Yup.

405
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:03,166
You see that giant?

406
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:06,333
The island's automated
artillery system.

407
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:08,000
If we stray from
the designated route,

408
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:11,333
that thing's what
we'll be answering to.

409
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:12,916
[ELIZABETH]
There's another one.

410
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,416
New Tesla really doesn't
want anybody visiting.

411
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,041
That's major firepower.

What's got you
riled, Sanchos?

415
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,208
A number of coils appear
to have stopped working.

416
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:28,833
The energy from Dimension W
is extremely weak in this area.

417
00:20:28,916 --> 00:20:30,708
It isn't zero, though?

418
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:33,333
[LOSER] If it were zero,
everyone would be affected.

419

In the void, life cannot
continue for long.

420
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:39,625
[TROOPER 7B]
Easter Island on the port side.

421
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:42,250
We'll prepare for

Ah, we're finally here!

The epitome of a

Mankind's insatiable
spirit of discovery

devoured a small
Pacific island in seconds,

426
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,416
changing it from a lush
land to a barren waste

427
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:06,000
devoid of any vegetation.

428
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:07,750
I didn't know
dimensional malfunction

429
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:09,416
could do this much damage.

430
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,583
[LOSER]
The world has an infinite

431
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:12,208
number of possibilities.

432
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:16,083
However, only one
is ever realized.

433
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:17,916
The possibilities that
do not come to pass

434
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,625
are folded into
layers in Dimension W

435
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:23,041
and changed into energy.

436
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:24,375
It's the materialization

437
00:21:24,458 --> 00:21:26,791
of those possibilities
that makes coils go wild.

438
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:30,083
And it causes those
haphazard protrusions.

Absolutely incredible.

Is it not a spectacular
sight, Commander Morgan?

It certainly is a shocking one.

A waterspout in back,
