Let's try to remain calm.

00:00:21,416 --> 00:00:23,291
[LOSER]
I had a feeling you would come,

00:00:23,375 --> 00:00:25,666
as a surviving
member of Grendel.

00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:27,458
You know, funny story.

I had a feeling that you'd
be here, too. You loser.

8

[KYOMA] There's a part
of me that's certain

you aren't a stranger.


10
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:07,458
The first time we talked
at that art gallery...


11

You knew me much better
than you should have.

12
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:13,416
You must've been here
back then. I know you were.

13
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,791
I have no memory of you
before the accident,

14
00:02:15,875 --> 00:02:17,791
so you must be an enemy.

15
00:02:17,875 --> 00:02:20,000
You were here at the
facilities five years ago,

16
00:02:20,083 --> 00:02:22,666
during our mission, am I right?

17
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,583

You're making educated guesses.

You really have
forgotten everything

20
00:02:28,833 --> 00:02:33,000
about that time, haven't you?
That is inexcusable.

21
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:34,666
How can you not
remember the reason

22
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,500
the void was born, the reason
the accident happened?

23
00:02:37,583 --> 00:02:39,333
How is that possible?

[LOSER] To return here
ignorant of everything?

28
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,541
Inexcusable! Unforgivable!

[KYOMA growls]

[LOSER] You should know,
I invented the energy shield.

32
00:02:56,833 --> 00:03:00,500
Mine is far superior to those
of the robots lying around.

It's not just his hands.

Why the hell are you doing this?

[LOSER] You have no right

39
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:19,000
You lost your memory,
and with it,

40
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:20,750
the knowledge of your crime.

41
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:23,958
That lapse is an insult to
my wife, and to all the people

42

who lost their lives here.

43

[KYOMA] Fine, I forgot.
So why don't you remind me?

Come on, tell me
everything you know!

45

[LOSER]
Me, tell you? Well, that's rich.

Have you observed

But the person closest
to the answer...

It's that sphere again, Debbie!

Oh, great. I wonder
what it wants this time!

Hurry! You need to get
out of there, Kyoma!

It's moving with purpose.

It knows what it wants.
He's there, isn't he?

Hold on. I recognize this.

59

I've seen it before.

Kyoma, no!

Hey, open your eyes!
You have to wake up.

62
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:18,625
If you know what's
going on, please tell me!

63
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:20,625
What's that sphere?
Where did it come from?

64
00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:22,916
Are you the one controlling it?

65
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
[LOSER]
No, the sphere is not mine.

66
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:28,333
However, I believe
I know what he's after.

67
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:32,125
Whether or not Kyoma returns
will be up to one man alone.

68

Papa, did it go how you wanted?

69

[LOSER]
The picture is becoming clearer.

70
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:45,416
I know this much: that sphere
is searching for the key again.

71
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,000
And as for the one
who holds the key...

72
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:51,500
It can only be him.
The man who knows everything.

out for longer.

How'd everything go?
How is she?

94
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:44,833
Not too good.

95
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:46,625
She was so weak she couldn't
even open her eyes.

96
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:48,291
I still talked to her
for a while, though.

I know she can hear me.

And how are you doing?

00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,750
It's gotta be hard
not being by her side.

That was the deal
I made with them.

How else could I pay for the
operation and the new body?

103

I could sell my kidneys
1,000 times over

and still not have enough
to cover the cost of it.

That's pretty incredible.

It had all been
carefully planned.

142

00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:38,625
until it self-destructs.

317
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:42,083
Theoretically, it could
reach third cosmic velocity.

318
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:46,000
Sixty thousand kilometers
per hour? Impressive.

319
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:48,000
[LOSER] As far as I know,
there's only one person

320
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:51,333
in the world who can
handle it. Kyoma Mabuchi.

321
00:14:51,416 --> 00:14:53,541
[ELIZABETH]
The guy in the ratty old coat?

322
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:55,083
[LOSER]
Yes, him.

323
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:57,541
He's also probably the one who
ripped a hole in this door.

324
00:14:57,625 --> 00:14:59,666
[ELIZABETH] He had a weapon
that was this incredible,

325
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:02,333
and he didn't use it?
Sounds like a real idiot.

326
00:15:02,416 --> 00:15:04,333
[LOSER] Beyond this door is
the center of the explosion

327
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:05,916
that created the void.

328
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,708
Not even I know what will
happen when we open it.

329
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:10,250
It's okay. I'm not scared.

330
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:12,625
And don't try telling
me to leave either.

331
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:16,333
You know as well as I do that
you would die without me, Papa.

332
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,750
[LOSER]
All right, then. Let's go.

333
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:25,750
[ELIZABETH gasps]

334
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:28,541
[ELIZABETH] I don't understand.
There's nothing here!

335
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:33,125
Is this really what we're
looking for? Is it ground zero?

336
00:15:33,208 --> 00:15:35,125
[LOSER]
What did you do, Sophia?

337
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:37,625
Did you send the
transporter out of control?

338
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:40,375
But... what about the gate?

339
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:42,916
[LOSER]
It looks like I'm going to need

340
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,541
another of the
Numbers, after all.

341
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:48,166
Our target, Haruka Seameyer,
moved around the world,

342
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:50,958
leaving a trail across
16 different countries.

343
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:53,916
Based upon his recent movements,
we believe he is here,

344
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,166
on Easter Island.

345
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:58,958
So what's on Easter Island?
Why would Seameyer go there?

346
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,541
[COLIN]
It's the home of Adrastea,

347
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:02,375
which some of you may
know as New Tesla's

348
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:04,166
top secret research facility.

349
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:05,708
Going to ground
there makes sense.

350
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:08,541
He'll be hard to reach if he
stays holed up in a secure site.

351
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:11,333
Remember, Seameyer is
a prominent scientist.

352
00:16:11,416 --> 00:16:13,625
There are many people in
his field who support him.

353
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:16,500
As much as I hate to say it,
what the doctor always feared

354
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:18,291
has indeed come to pass.

355
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:20,458
The scientists are revolting
against the executives

356
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:24,958
at New Tesla Energy. Meaning
this is going to get ugly.

357
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:28,625
Huh?

358
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:30,291
It appears there has
been a sudden change

359
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:32,250
in Miss Azumaya's condition.

360
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:35,041
She will be undergoing
emergency surgery shortly.

361
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:38,333
You may go to her now,
but you have only six hours.

362
00:16:38,416 --> 00:16:40,791
--Hurry. There's not much time.
--[helicopter whirring]

363
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:42,916
[footsteps tapping]

364
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,666
[KYOMA]
This again? It's like déjà vu.

365
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:47,833
Like I'm being forced
to dream the same dream

366
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:49,500
over and over.

367
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:52,250
Like someone's poking
around inside my head,

368
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:54,291
laughing at me as they
watch because they know

369
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:56,583
how it's all going to end.

370
00:16:58,458 --> 00:17:01,666
[KYOMA] That's a good
look for you. Really.

371
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,458
I'm glad you came.

372
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:07,041
I knew you would, of course.
I didn't doubt it for a second.

373
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:09,291
Unfortunately, I can't
stay very long,

374
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,500
but I'll be back before
the operation's over,

375
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:13,166
I promise you that.

376
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:16,208
Then I have something
to look forward to

377
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:18,250
when I wake up,
so please don't worry.

378
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:21,583
I know you'll keep your promise,
like you always do.

379
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:23,500
[KYOMA]
Now's no different.

380
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:27,125
[MIYABI] Yeah. Will you
do something for me?

381
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:31,250
Look at my palm for
a second. See that?

382
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:34,041
Check out my life line.
It's in two parts.

383
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:37,750
There's a break, but then it
goes on for a long time.

384
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:40,083
This is the end
of the first part,

385
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:41,666
but on the other side

386
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:44,458
is the new life
that you've given me.

387
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:46,125
I'll get through this.

388
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:48,000
There's nothing
to be worried about.

389
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:49,250
[KYOMA gasps]

390
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:51,875
[KYOMA] What the hell?
Where did she come from?

391
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,750
You've always been good
at running from the truth.

392
00:17:57,833 --> 00:18:00,500
So, how long ago
did you notice it?

393
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:01,750
[KYOMA]
What?

394
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:02,541
[SHADOW KYOMA]
Why do you do this to yourself?

395
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:04,000
What do you mean?

396
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,208
You've watched this little
scene play out in your head

397
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:07,166
a million times, and
nothing's ever changed.

398
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:09,583
So I'm dreaming? Is that
what you're telling me?

399
00:18:09,666 --> 00:18:11,416
[SHADOW KYOMA]
Dreaming? [chuckles]

400
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,958
That would be nice, wouldn't it?

401
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:16,375
If it were all just a dream.
If losing Miyabi and your squad

402
00:18:16,458 --> 00:18:19,458
was just a figment of
an overactive imagination.

403
00:18:19,541 --> 00:18:22,041
It's time to wake up and
face the facts, you idiot!

404
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:24,333
[KYOMA grunts]

405
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:25,791
[KYOMA]
Aw, man.

406
00:18:25,875 --> 00:18:28,333
What am I doing?
Have I totally lost it?

407
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:31,791
Sorry, I wish I
could stay longer.

408
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:33,916
I have to go.
Duty calls, and all that.

409
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,458
[MIYABI]
Okay.

410
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:37,083
[KYOMA]
I'm glad I got to see you.

411
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:39,791
Even for just a little bit.

412
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:41,250
It'll be different next time.

413
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:43,875
I swear, I won't ever
let you go again.

414
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:46,666
So, it's a promise?

415
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,666
It's a promise, Miyabi.

416
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:53,208
[KYOMA]
What's going on?

417
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:55,625
Wasn't I supposed to
wake up after that?

418
00:19:01,416 --> 00:19:03,500
Prince Salva? Why are you here?

419
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:05,125
Me? Why are you--?

420
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:08,166
[KYOMA] Loo! What's wrong?
What happened to him?

421
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:10,583
[SALVA] I don't understand.
This makes no sense.

422
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:13,708
What are you doing here?
You shouldn't be in this memory.

423
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:15,041
You don't belong in it.

424
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:16,958
Were you taken? Did it get you?

425
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:18,958
What? You mean by the sphere?

426
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:20,208
Then you al--

427
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:24,416
[SALVA gasps]
Where are you? Where did you go?

428
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:27,625
[KYOMA] I get it now.
That's what I'm seeing.

429
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:30,541
Memories. These are
all memories.

430
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:31,750
[SEAMEYER]
That's right.

431
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:33,458
Every memory that
has been created

432
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:36,833
since the beginning of the
universe. Dazzling, isn't it?

433
00:19:36,916 --> 00:19:39,166
We are one step away
from the void.

434
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:43,958
Right now, you are looking at
the very essence of Dimension W.

435
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:46,166
Haruka Seameyer!

436
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:48,083
[SEAMEYER] Memories are
the key to the connection

437
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:51,166
between Dimension W and
the material universe.

438
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:52,583
[KYOMA]
The key?

439
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:54,666
[SEAMEYER] Future possibilities
are based upon memories

440
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,458
of that which came before.

441
00:19:56,541 --> 00:19:59,291
Without memories,
the universe could not exist.

442
00:19:59,375 --> 00:20:01,083
Do you understand,
Kyoma Mabuchi?

443
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:02,916
How do you know my name?

444
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,416
I've been waiting.

445
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:10,625
Waiting for you to appear,
and at long last, here you are.

446
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:13,250
Now I'm dying to see
what you have to show me.

447
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:16,958
Starting with the moment at
which you escaped from the void.

448
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:18,750
You're sending me back there?

449
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:21,291
[MIRA]
Kyoma!

450
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,750
[KYOMA gasps]

451
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:28,416
[MIYABI] Believe in them.
Believe in your memories.

452
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,083
Believe that you made
the right choice.

453
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:32,000
[KYOMA]
Miyabi.

454
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:40,083
[MIYABI]
I believe in you, Kyo.

455
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:42,958
I believe in your possibilities.

456
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:47,250
[SEAMEYER gasps]
What's going on? What happened?

457
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:52,625
[DEBBIE] This isn't good.
He's still not waking up?

458
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:53,875
No.

459
00:20:53,958 --> 00:20:55,625
His heart rate is just
six beats per minute,

460
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:57,666
and his body temperature
is falling.

461
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:00,791
He's still breathing for
the moment. But barely.

462
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:02,458
Uh...

463
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:08,875
He carries her picture.

464
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:12,208
Who's the girl?
She a friend of yours?

465
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:13,666
No, actually.

466
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:16,208
I could tell you her name,
but I've never met her.

467
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:18,166
[DEBBIE]
Oh. 'Kay.

468
00:21:19,791 --> 00:21:22,333
[MIRA]
Miyabi Azumaya.

469
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:23,500
[MARY]
Kyoma's wife.

470
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:25,666
Or she would be if
she were still alive.

471
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:28,250
What? She passed away?
What happened?

472
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:30,500
There was an accident
involving a coil.

473
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:32,583
I didn't know. He never said.

474
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:34,500
[MARY] He probably didn't
want you of all people

475
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:35,875
to know about it.

476
00:21:35,958 --> 00:21:38,541
Because I'm a robot and
therefore powered by a coil?

477
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:42,041
[MARY] Look at her profile
again. Notice anything?

478
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:46,041
[gasps] Our bodies
are exactly alike.

479
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:47,541
From height and weight
down to measurements

480
00:21:47,625 --> 00:21:49,000
and even shoe size.

481
00:21:49,083 --> 00:21:51,166
There's a reason you
and Miyabi Azumaya

482
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:52,583
are so physically similar.

483
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:54,333
It's because your body
was made to fit her.

484
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:55,375
Huh?

485
00:21:55,458 --> 00:21:57,041
Not just yours, for that matter.

486
00:21:57,125 --> 00:22:00,083
All of the original bodies
crafted by Dr. Seira Yurizaki

487
00:22:00,166 --> 00:22:01,916
were made to
those specifications.

488
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
They were created for
the purpose of saving her,

489
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:05,250
the test subject
for the doctor's

490
00:22:05,333 --> 00:22:07,541
body transplant experiment.

491
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:09,666
My body could've
belonged to her, then.

492
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:11,416
[MARY] It's crazy when
you think about it.

493
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,666
Easter Island is thousands
of kilometers away

494
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:16,625
from the hospital where Miyabi
was having her surgery,

495
00:22:16,708 --> 00:22:20,125
yet the accidents occurred at
almost exactly the same time.

496
00:22:20,208 --> 00:22:24,416
The incidents aren't connected,
according to the authorities.

497
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,708
But, of course,
Kyoma isn't as convinced

498
00:22:26,791 --> 00:22:28,541
about that as they are.

499
00:22:28,625 --> 00:22:30,333
[MIRA]
It must be so difficult.

500
00:22:30,416 --> 00:22:31,750
What does he think
when I'm around?

501
00:22:31,833 --> 00:22:34,791
How can he look at me
and not see her?

502
00:22:34,875 --> 00:22:36,125
[gasps] Look!

503
00:22:36,208 --> 00:22:37,458
What is it?

504
00:22:37,541 --> 00:22:39,958
[MIRA]
Another of the enemy's weapons.

505
00:22:41,833 --> 00:22:43,625
[DEBBIE] You know we've got
nowhere to run, right?

506
00:22:43,708 --> 00:22:45,125
Then we'll have to fight.

507
00:22:45,208 --> 00:22:46,958
Because I will protect Kyoma!
