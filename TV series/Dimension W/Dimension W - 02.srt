[NARRATOR]
In the year 2036,

17
00:01:22,458 --> 00:01:25,333
a fourth dimensional axis
beyond X, Y, and Z

18
00:01:25,416 --> 00:01:28,958
was proved to exist:
Dimension W.

19
00:01:29,041 --> 00:01:31,125
Inter-dimensional
electromagnetic

20
00:01:31,208 --> 00:01:33,375
induction devices,
known as "coils,"

21
00:01:33,458 --> 00:01:35,291
were developed to
tap the inexhaustible

22
00:01:35,375 --> 00:01:39,041
energy supply that
exists in Dimension W.

23
00:01:39,125 --> 00:01:41,625
Sixty giant towers
spread across the globe

24
00:01:41,708 --> 00:01:45,083
are used to stabilize the energy
drawn from Dimension W.

25
00:01:45,166 --> 00:01:47,166
They are responsible
for supplying power

the "world system."
It has altered the very core

He broadcasts his

Really? I get it now.

43
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:13,541
That must be why
they call him "Loser."

44
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:15,500
"Due to this fact,
some believe that the victims

are working with Loser to
stage these so-called heists

as a means of advertising."

47
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:21,625
If that's true,
it would explain why

48
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:24,291
he goes to the trouble
of broadcasting everything.

49
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:27,750
Still. If he doesn't actually
steal anything or hurt anybody,

50
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:30,875
he isn't much of
a criminal, is he?

to broadcast his heists.

However he manages it,
you can bet

54
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:41,000
that illegal coils are involved.

It's not Loser I care about.

Why would you wanna do that?

65

my father said.

"When I die, follow the illegal
coils." That's what he told me.

Yes.

The range for this

Somewhere in that area, there'll
be jammers with illegal coils.

None at all. It's crazy.

It's like he's a relic from
another age or something.

184

[LOSER] I've heard of a

I know plenty of things.

For example, I know that
a legendary special ops unit

known as Grendel
fought in the last war.

We live in an age of

Eventually.

I've been using illegal coils!

I've got to get them out
and hide them somewhere.

them, that's it! Ah!

Maybe that would help. Hold on.

Oh, no! I'm not a robot.

340

I, uh... I'm really a Collector.

00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:38,250
Yeah! That's me. Ha, ha.

342
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:39,333
[ELIZABETH]
You have antennae.

343
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:41,625
You mean these?
They're not antennae.

344
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:44,041
No, these are just hairpins.

345
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:45,541
They're on the big side, I know.

346
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,125
[ELIZABETH]
Hairpins?

347
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:50,333
Anyway, I'm really impressed.
You did a good job with these.

348
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:53,291
There are pigeons everywhere,
so you could plant your devices

349
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:55,791
into a real flock
without anyone noticing.

350
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:57,291
But how did you figure it out?

351
00:18:57,375 --> 00:18:59,541
Those birds look exactly
like the real thing!

352
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:01,916
Not to sound immodest,
but I have a little talent

353
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,125
with manipulating coils.

354
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:06,541
I admit, I didn't
see them at first.

355
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:09,125
But as I kept watching,
I noticed that there were some

356
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:11,458
that kept flying back
to the same positions.

357
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:14,833
Impossible. Nobody in
the world could do that!

358
00:19:14,916 --> 00:19:16,625
Not impossible. Just difficult.

359
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:18,625
Anyway, once I
pinpointed the pigeons,

360
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:20,750
I used surveillance
camera logs to determine

361
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:22,041
where they were flying from

362
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:24,041
and that's what led
me to this place.

363
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:26,666
Amazing. Are you
sure you're a human?

364
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,375
Yes. Of course I am.

How many times
do I have to say it?
