1
00:00:12,375 --> 00:00:15,875
[LOSER pants] That light
is so bright. Is it...?

2
00:00:15,958 --> 00:00:19,250
Yes. Yes, it is.

3
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:23,958
I thought that staying
out of your range

4
00:00:24,041 --> 00:00:26,625
would be an effective strategy.

5
00:00:26,708 --> 00:00:28,375
[CHRYSLER groans]

6
00:00:29,458 --> 00:00:31,500
But it looks like
my suit broke first.

7
00:00:31,583 --> 00:00:33,750
I'm the loser this time.

8
00:00:36,208 --> 00:00:37,875
[LOSER] That's what
happens when you rely

9
00:00:37,958 --> 00:00:40,208
too much on coils.

10
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:43,208
[LOSER groans]

11
00:00:43,291 --> 00:00:45,458
[LOSER]
No time for weakness.

12
00:00:53,125 --> 00:00:55,333
[LOSER]
Finally, the fifth Numbers.

13
00:00:55,416 --> 00:00:58,625
I have all the key
coils now. I'm ready.

14
00:00:59,916 --> 00:01:03,750
[LOSER screams]

15
00:01:03,833 --> 00:01:05,041
[ELIZABETH]
Papa!

16
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:09,208
Are you okay? Papa!

17
00:01:09,291 --> 00:01:13,083
[LOSER] Yes. I'm fine.
Everything's fine.

18
00:01:13,166 --> 00:01:15,083
[ELIZABETH gasps]

19
00:01:15,166 --> 00:01:17,000
[LOSER]
Let's go.

20
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:48,625
I have more than one body.

21
00:02:48,708 --> 00:02:50,833
That makes me
pretty hard to kill.

22
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:56,333
Hold on. Are you saying
that you're a robot?


23
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:58,375
[LWAI]
Mm-mm. No, I'm not.


24
00:02:58,458 --> 00:02:59,875
There was an accident,
but because of it,

25
00:02:59,958 --> 00:03:03,875
I lost use of my entire body.
But I am still human.

26
00:03:03,958 --> 00:03:06,541
My original body is
back home, safe in Isla.

27
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:09,250
So you control
this one remotely?

28
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:12,166
[LWAI] It's a system that Salva
designed especially for me.

29
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:13,583
There's no lag
because the connection

30
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:15,541
goes through Dimension W.

31
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:17,416
It's plugged directly
into my consciousness,

32
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:21,125
so I can control this body
as if it were truly my own.

33
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:23,541
I'm amazed Salva was
able to create this.

34
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:26,000
And for the most part,
it works flawlessly.

35
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:28,000
The only catch is, if my
consciousness becomes

36
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:29,916
too deeply linked
to the body I'm using,

37
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,958
I have a hard time
separating from it.

38
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:33,291
So if you're not
paying attention,

39
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:34,875
you could get stuck
there permanently?

40
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:37,000
--[LWAI] Yeah.
--[DEBBIE, HARRY gasp]

41
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:38,708
[LWAI] When Yuri attacked
me, I lost awareness

42
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:41,125
of what was going on
outside my body.

43
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:45,250
I was distracted, so I became
unable to operate objectively.

44
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:47,500
I tried to get things
running properly again,

45
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:49,166
but nothing seemed to work.

46
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:51,583
As a last resort,
I killed that body.

47
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:52,833
[KYOMA]
So, that's what happened.

48
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:55,458
You coulda warned me first.

49
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:58,666
[LWAI] I wasn't sure whether
or not it would even work.

50
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,208
Technically, Salva's
the only one

51
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:02,708
who is authorized to do a
forced termination like that.

52
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:04,458
But he's asleep,
and I don't know when,

53
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:05,666
or if, that'll change.

54
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,541
We should have said
something sooner!

55
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:09,791
We know how to wake him up.

56
00:04:10,916 --> 00:04:14,416
[CASSIDY] You were right.
Here it is. Damn, that's creepy.

57
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,958
Prince Salva! Can you hear me?

58
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:19,791
[grunts] Lasithi, what happened?

59
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:21,791
You came back to us!

60
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,083
Removing it worked!
My brother is awake!

61
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:28,625
Good!

62
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:31,083
[LWAI] So, now that
you know, do you hate me?

63
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:32,375
[gasps]

64
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:33,875
Do you think you can
be friends with someone

65
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:35,916
who's part-robot, Kyoma?

66
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,291
[KYOMA] Don't worry, kid. I
don't care what body you're in.

67
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:43,708
As far I'm concerned,
you're you. You got that?

68
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:46,958
Well, let's go.

69
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:48,291
[DEBBIE]
What about those two?

70
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:49,958
Should we bring 'em with us?

71
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:51,958
They can stay here. Who knows?

72
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:55,125
Yuri may still wake up.
It's up to him.

73
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:12,333
I think you and I
have done this before.

74
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:14,041
This feels very familiar.

75
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:16,375
We've met. Well, sort of.

76
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:18,791
[SALVA] Yes, that's right.
I remember now.

77
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:20,791
You wandered into my dream.

78
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:23,416
[KYOMA] I can't say whether
it was your dream or mine.

79
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,333
Can you, your Highness?

80
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:26,458
Just Salva.

81
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:27,833
There's no need for
titles or ceremony

82
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:31,333
between us, my friend.
I owe you a great debt.

83
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:34,000
[KYOMA] Loo is a good kid. And
you seem like a good brother.

84
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:36,208
I thought you were only using
him for your own ends,

85
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:38,250
trying to gain power
by controlling the boy

86
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:40,291
who's in line for Isla's throne.

87
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:42,333
I'm glad to know I was wrong.

88
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:44,208
You don't owe me anything.

89
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:46,750
Now then, let's keep moving.

90
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:48,458
I don't know about you,
but I'm ready

91
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:50,291
to put an end to this.

92
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:58,375
So, that's it. That's where
the light's coming from.

93
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:01,000
[MIRA]
It's Adrastea.

94
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:03,625
[DEBBIE]
Whoa, look at that. So many!

95
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:05,750
It's that same door
over and over.

96
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:08,000
The materialization
of Dimension W.

97
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:09,041
[SALVA]
Hm.

98
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:10,875
How do things look, Loo?

99
00:06:10,958 --> 00:06:14,083
My radar doesn't show anything
to indicate functioning robots.

100
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:16,708
And the energy from
Dimension W is stable, too.

101
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:19,000
I think we're all clear, Salva.

102
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:21,250
[SALVA]
It's decided. We'll go inside.

103
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:24,125
Once Dr. Yurizaki knew
the capabilities of Genesis

104
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:25,541
and the consequences of its use,

105
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:28,000
he sealed off his own research,
but what we'll find

106
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:30,625
beyond that door
is anyone's guess.

107
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:32,625
I had a feeling you
knew more about this.

108
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:34,000
Um, what's Genesis?

109
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:35,666
It's an incredibly
powerful coil

110
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,791
with the ability to make
something from nothing.

111
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:41,750
That coil is the reason I came.
I must find it for Lwai's sake.

112
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:43,750
And to continue
the royal bloodline.

113
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:46,250
[MIRA] The term Genesis
doesn't sound familiar to me.

114
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:47,833
I don't think that's
the name Father gave

115
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:49,791
to the project
he was working on.

116
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:51,333
Are you sure about this?

117
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:54,000
I'm not finding a single mention
of that coil in my database.

118
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:55,333
No, you wouldn't.

119
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:58,000
Its existence is classified
as top secret intel.

120
00:06:58,083 --> 00:06:59,291
Knowledge of it is forbidden.

121
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:00,708
If you're using
an official coil,

122
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:03,750
it will immediately delete
any reference to Genesis.

123
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:05,291
I'm only able to
talk about it here

124
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:07,291
since we're outside
tower control.

125
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:09,625
I would recommend not speaking
of it to anyone else.

126
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:11,916
[CASSIDY] I don't care what the
coil does or how secret it is.

127
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,125
I'm just in this for
the reward. The offer stands

128
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:16,958
after everything
that's happened, right?

129
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:19,291
First Collector to the coil
gets 50 million dollars,

130
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:20,500
that's what you said.

131
00:07:20,583 --> 00:07:22,500
That was before. Now I'm
offering twice that.

132
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:24,000
One hundred million
to the person

133
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:26,166
who gets me the real Genesis.

134
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:30,541
See ya later, guys.
I've got a date with a coil.

135
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:34,041
That hundred million belongs
to Scorpion Cat Cassidy.

00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:47,875
Shouldn't we stay
and help, though?

159
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:50,000
I'd be better than them
at holding off those robots.

160
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:52,125
Don't worry about
those guys. They're pros.

161
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:54,166
[MIRA screams]

162
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:02,291
I'm not sure how
it's connected,

163
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:05,500
but I think all this has
something to do with you.

164
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:09,291
Genesis. The term that's
deleted if it's observed.

165
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:12,083
Probably has something to do
with the gaps in your memory.

166
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:14,000
Especially where the
doctor is concerned.

167
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:15,583
Many of your memories
would have been erased

168
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:18,125
when you began using
an official coil.

169
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:19,791
The only thing that
remained totally clear

170
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:21,000
was the message from the doctor

171
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:23,000
about following
the illegal coils.

172
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:24,375
Yes.

173
00:09:24,458 --> 00:09:25,500
[KYOMA]
When he created the message,

174
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:27,625
why did he choose
that specific word?

175
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:30,541
He didn't say "find."
He said "follow."

176
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:32,750
That's been bothering me
ever since you told us.

177
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:34,208
[MIRA]
Is that why you brought me here?

178
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:36,625
So we could figure out what
Father's message meant?

179
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:38,541
[KYOMA]
The doctor wasn't a stupid man.

180
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:40,541
Don't you think he assumed
that the word "Genesis"

181
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:41,333
would be deleted?

182
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:43,250
[gasps] Yes, you're right.

183
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:44,958
Is it possible this
was Father's method

184
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:47,666
of implicitly commanding me
to come to Easter Island?

185
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,916
Seems probable to me.
He wanted you someplace

186
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,208
free from New Tesla's
surveillance.

187
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:55,250
And now you've gotta
figure out why.

188
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:57,625
I came here to confront
the truth of that day,

189
00:09:57,708 --> 00:09:59,500
whatever it might
turn out to be.

190
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:01,416
Once I've done that,
settled this,

191
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,291
I'll finally be able to
stand in front of her.

192
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,000
[MIRA grunts]

193
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:13,458
[SALVA] This is it. The entrance
to the main chamber.

194
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:17,208
Right. This guy.

195
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:20,125
There's a few things I need
to settle with him, too.

196
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:24,333
[gasps]

197
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:26,333
[LOSER] You came.
I can't say I'm surprised.

198
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:27,750
[KYOMA]
Of course you're not.

199
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:29,708
You knew everything, didn't you?

200
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:31,291
[LOSER]
Yes, all of it.

201
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:34,666
The accident occurred because
the transporter went wild.

202
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:37,291
There were two people
operating it at the time.

203
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:39,333
One was my wife Sophia.

204
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:41,500
The other was Haruka Seameyer.

205
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:44,375
So your true identity
is Julian Tyler.

206
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:47,208
But how is that possible?
How could you have survived?

207
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:50,041
[LOSER] Yes, I was on this
island the day of the accident

208
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:52,250
and, through an
ugly twist of fate,

209
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:55,500
I was allowed to live. Look.

210
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:03,750
A space-time distortion.

211
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:06,833
[LOSER] Yes. And do you
know what that means?

212
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:09,958
A gate made by the
transporter is open.

213
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:12,500
Five years ago,
the wild transporter

214
00:11:12,583 --> 00:11:15,333
teleported Adrastea and
everything around it.

215
00:11:15,416 --> 00:11:17,541
In doing so, it depleted
the surrounding area

216
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:21,125
of all Dimension W energy,
dropping it into the void.

217
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:22,541
And the transporter?

218
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:24,958
Did it disappear into the void
with everything else?

219
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:27,875
[LOSER] No. The transporter
itself was not teleported.

220
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:30,750
[SALVA] Well, then, what
happened to it? Where did it go?

221
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:33,208
There are a lot of blanks
that still need filling in.

222
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:34,666
Something was restored
from the void.

223
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:37,000
What was it? Genesis?

224
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:38,916
[KYOMA]
I'm running out of patience

225
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,125
with this game of yours, Loser.

226
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:42,833
I want you to tell us
everything you know

227
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:45,166
about what happened.

228
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:47,916
[LOSER]
Very well, then. I'll tell you.

229
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,125
If you really think you're
ready to witness the truth.

230
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:52,583
[KYOMA, MIRA gasp]

231
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:53,833
[ELIZABETH grunts]

232
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:00,958
[gasps]

233
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:04,291
[SOPHIA]
Julian.

234
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:08,166
[MIRA gasps] Wow, so we're
inside Loser's memory?

235
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:10,416
Looks like it.
This should be fun.

236
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,625
[SOPHIA] This is perhaps our
most fundamental equation.

237
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:16,666
It shows that Dimension W energy
is equal to possibility

238
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:19,750
times mass times the
speed of light squared.

239
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:22,208
Essentially, the energy
from Dimension W

240
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:26,708
expresses itself in our universe
in the form of possibility.

241
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:28,750
Using this theory,
we can also solve

242
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:30,583
for the speed of light
and see that it equals

243
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:33,041
the rate of renewal
for possibility.

244
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:37,333
[JULIAN] That was a really
good lecture. You're a natural.

245
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:38,708
[SOPHIA]
Oh, thanks.

246
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:41,000
[SHIDO] Hello, Sophia.
It's good to see you again.

247
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:42,958
[SOPHIA]
Oh! Dr. Yurizaki!

248
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:45,166
--Father's here!
--It's good to see you too, sir!

249
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:46,458
[SOPHIA]
I'm so honored that you came.

250
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:47,833
Of course I came.

251
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:50,041
I heard there was a big
discovery made at Adrastea.

252
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:51,291
Yes.

253
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:52,708
Let me introduce you.

254
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:53,458
[growls]

255
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:55,208
This is Haruka Seameyer.

256
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:58,291
He's an exceptionally
promising student of mine.

257
00:12:58,375 --> 00:12:59,958
I think of him as my protégé.

258
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:02,041
I've taught him
everything I know.

259
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:05,375
Hello. I'm so glad
Dr. Yurizaki brought me.

260
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:07,541
It's a pleasure to
meet all of you.

261
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:08,666
Nice to meet you.

262
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,250
We're glad to have
you here, Seameyer.

263
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:12,541
I'm Julian Tyler. It'll be
good to work with you.

264
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:16,916
[SEAMEYER] Oh, thank you.
Thank you so much.

265
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
[JULIAN] As you can see,
we have three boxes here.

266
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:21,791
One contains a live mouse,
one contains a dead mouse,

267
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:24,041
and one contains a toy mouse.

268
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:27,291
[JULIAN]
This teleportation experiment

269
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:28,916
doesn't involve relocation.

270
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,125
They're supposed to
rematerialize in the same place.

271
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:32,916
And in two of
the cases, it works.

272
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Yes, I see.

273
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:35,708
The dead mouse and
toy mouse remain,

274
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:37,916
but it can't rematerialize life.

275
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,541
Imperfect as it is,
there'd be many

276
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:41,083
practical uses for the device.

277
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:43,500
but I'm hesitant to continue
when there's a major flaw

278
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:45,833
we can't explain.

279
00:13:45,916 --> 00:13:49,083
If you want an explanation,
I can offer one.

280
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:50,666
Even though the
energy of the mouse

281
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:55,458
is drawn out with the coil, the
possibility of the mouse is not.

282
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:57,583
I believe, if we could
better understand that,

283
00:13:57,666 --> 00:13:58,708
we'd be one step closer

284
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:00,958
to comprehending
the mystery of life.

285
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:03,166
You think it's that
significant? Honestly?

286
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:04,458
[SHIDO]
Absolutely.

287
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:06,833
After years of research
and experimentation,

288
00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:08,708
I'm certain that
life and Dimension W

289
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:10,541
are deeply connected.

290
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:12,875
Possibility cannot be observed.

291
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:15,250
Sophia, can you
tell me why that is?

292
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:16,958
[SOPHIA] Because when a
possibility is observed,

293
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:18,583
it becomes a reality.

294
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:20,750
It's along the lines
of Schrödinger's cat.

295
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:22,083
[SHIDO]
Exactly.

296
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:24,291
Even if we can
predict a possibility,

297
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:25,625
we can't observe it

298
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:28,666
because in doing so,
we alter its very nature.

299
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,875
And although possibility
can never be seen,

300
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:33,083
we are, nevertheless,
certain it exists.

301
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:34,625
Tell me why that is.

302
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:35,958
As intelligent beings,

303
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:38,166
we ourselves are
creatures of possibility.

304
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,000
[SHIDO]
That's precisely right.

305
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:41,708
It's hard to pinpoint
what it is exactly

306
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:43,375
that makes up our intelligence.

307
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:45,541
However, we do know that
all life is capable

308
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:48,083
of perceiving possibility
and reflecting it.

309
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:51,458
So, whether we can see it or
not, it is part of our being.

310
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:54,041
The coils we have
now are incomplete.

311
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:56,791
They're inadequate in the
face of life's profundity.

312
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:59,666
Of course, a coil that could

Genesis.

318
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:12,541
[LOSER] That's right. Genesis.
The ultimate coil.

319
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:15,708
The one that could
control everything.

320
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:17,458
We threw ourselves
at the problem

321
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:19,791
and quickly became consumed.

322
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:23,958
In our effort to complete
Genesis, we made five Numbers.

323

Seameyer devoted
himself entirely

324
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:28,375
to formulating the theory.

325
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:31,083
But then, the inspectors came.

That's my laboratory! My work!
You can't just barge in there!

close to completing it!

I believe that was the moment

00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:20,666
when Seameyer snapped. His
curiosity twisted into madness.

Whoa! Where's the floor?

It's there. I just can't see it.

The completed transporter.
Is that what we're seeing?

Let us out of here!
What are you doing?

351
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:33,250
I thought you were going
to use the transporter

352
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:34,958
to take back the
documents they stole.

And you believed me?

00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,958
How very gullible of you.

358
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:45,291
I formulated my own
working theory for Genesis

359
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:46,875
a long time ago.

360
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:50,041
I don't need help from that
traitor, Shido Yurizaki,

361
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:52,000
All that remains is
to verify my theory

362
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:54,666
and make some final adjustments.

363
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:55,958
But in order to proceed,

364
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:58,250
I required access
to this transporter,

365
00:16:58,333 --> 00:17:01,500
which necessitated some
deception on my part.

366
00:17:01,583 --> 00:17:04,833
There is nothing I wouldn't do
to see Genesis complete.

367
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:08,083
No matter how many
lives it might cost.

Kyoma, is that Genesis?

369
00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:12,750
That's it. The reason
for all of this.

370
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:15,291
[SEAMEYER laughs]
We have reached

371
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:16,916
the final phase of testing.

372
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,208
Genesis will be complete when I
can successfully teleport life.

How many people it will take?

one way to find out, eh?

You're evil. How can
you do this?

00:21:34,458 --> 00:21:36,625
if Kyoma had Genesis with him?

471
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:38,208
[SEAMEYER]
If anyone wants my opinion,

472
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:42,125
I'd say he left it on the
lost fragment of Adrastea.

473
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:43,333
But that's just a guess.

474
00:21:43,416 --> 00:21:45,375
He's the only one
who knows for sure.

475
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:49,500
With access to his memory,
I can finally locate Genesis.

476
00:21:49,583 --> 00:21:52,708
I don't understand any of this.
Why would I leave like that?

477
00:21:52,791 --> 00:21:56,125
Abandon my commander,
my friends. How could I?

478
00:21:56,208 --> 00:21:58,625
You've got to pull
yourself together, Kyoma!

479
00:21:58,708 --> 00:22:00,250
[laughs] I'll get what I need.

480
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:02,791
There are many ways to
follow somebody's memories.

481

[LOSER]
Seameyer!

482
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:08,916
Sophia, my wife. Where is she?

483
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,250
Be realistic.

484
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:11,958
Do you really think I'd
let her go unpunished

485
00:22:12,041 --> 00:22:13,708
after what she did to me?

486
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:16,833
[LOSER]
Tell me where my wife is.

487
00:22:16,916 --> 00:22:18,166
[SEAMEYER] If you wanna
see her that badly,

488
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:20,291
I can arrange it for you.

489
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:27,208
[MIRA]
Kyoma!

490
00:22:37,333 --> 00:22:38,458
[SEAMEYER]
There.

491
00:22:38,541 --> 00:22:41,916
May I present to you,
your darling Sopia!

492
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:42,958
