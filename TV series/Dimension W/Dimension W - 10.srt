1
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,333
We can defeat it. I have a plan.

2
00:00:17,416 --> 00:00:19,333
But I'll need a
favor from you two.

3
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:28,541
[MIRA] It only defends
against collision energy

4
00:00:28,625 --> 00:00:30,458
that will cause it damage.

5
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:31,833
[MIRA gasps]

6
00:00:34,375 --> 00:00:36,125
[MIRA grunts]

7
00:00:42,291 --> 00:00:44,958
Whatever I do,
I will protect Kyoma.

8
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:23,166
Hey! Over here!

9
00:02:28,833 --> 00:02:31,458
[MIRA] Excuse me, but I
need to borrow your body.

10
00:02:35,083 --> 00:02:37,625
[MIRA] I have to keep its
focus away from Kyoma.

11
00:02:37,708 --> 00:02:39,625
I'll make myself the
more tempting target.

12
00:02:39,708 --> 00:02:41,708
and draw its fire this way.

13
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:43,208
Here it comes!

14
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:46,166
[DEBBIE]
Good job luring it!

15
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:50,750
Your turn, Harry!

16
00:02:56,625 --> 00:02:57,541
All right! We did it!

17
00:02:57,625 --> 00:02:59,166
Squashed it like a bug!

18
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:02,666
I'm sorry for the intrusion,

19
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:05,083
but I'll need to
stop your coil now.

20
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:12,000
[gasps]

21
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:16,125
Is it only after Kyoma?

22
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:17,750
I won't let it get him!

23
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,041
[MIRA]
There's no time,

24
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:22,000
I'll have to remove
the coil directly.

25
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:24,833
Got it!

26
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:28,875
[gasps]

27
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:30,708
[MIRA]
I can't arrest my momentum.

28
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:33,166
That's the void up ahead.

29
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:35,000
A stupid, careless mistake.

30
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:38,250
It's my fault for not including
this in my calculations.

31
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:40,041
But I guess it's okay.

32
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:42,250
All that matters is
keeping Kyoma safe.

33
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:45,541
If I've done that then I've
performed my duty as a robot.

34
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:57,166
[yelps]

35
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:58,333
[MIRA groans]

36
00:03:58,416 --> 00:04:00,208
[KYOMA]
Man, it's always somethin'.

37
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:02,708
Can't a guy nap in peace?

38
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:05,500
[MIRA] Kyoma, you're awake!
I'm so glad you're okay!

39
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:08,291
Enough with the waterworks.
What'd I tell you about crying?

40
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:09,291
I can't help it.

41
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:10,625
Do you know how
worried I've been?

42
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:12,041
[KYOMA] Think we can turn
the volume down a notch?

43
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:13,750
My head's about to explode.

44
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:16,416
Aw, man. It felt like
that dream lasted forever.

45
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,875
A dream?

46
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:21,250
That's what it felt like.
A dream. Or maybe a memory.

47
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:28,041
[KYOMA]
Anyway. You did a good job.

48
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:30,625
[MIRA] That was strange. It felt
different than the other times

49
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:32,625
he's touched me somehow.

50
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:33,916
[MIRA]
Wait, come back!

51
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,416
Do you think you could
do that again, please?

52
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,333
[KYOMA] Don't get carried
away, piece of junk.

53
00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:40,625
Aw, back to that nickname again?

54
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:43,916
[KYOMA] Damn it. Looks like
the car's not an option.

55
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,500
[DEBBIE] Oh, hey! You woke up.
Feelin' all right?

56
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:48,916
Yeah, and thanks for all
the help. I appreciate it.

57
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,916
The way I see it,
now we're even.

58
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,291
Guess so.

59
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:55,291
[MIRA gasps] Your ear!
It's all torn up and bloody!

60
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:58,375
[KYOMA] Oh. Yeah it's
all right, I did it myself.

61
00:04:58,458 --> 00:04:59,875
[MIRA]
Huh?

62
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:01,958
[KYOMA] It was the only way
I could get this off of it.

63
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:04,041
--So gross.
--What is that thing anyway?

64
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:06,708
[KYOMA] I'm guessing it's what
caused me to have that dream.

65
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:09,583
I bet it works by manipulating
the unconscious mind somehow.

66
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:11,583
I can't believe I didn't
notice it was there.

67
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:13,500
Don't be too quick
to beat yourself up.

68
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:15,041
There's no coil in it
and it was stuck

69
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:16,583
directly on the
back of my earlobe.

70
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:18,208
Without you noticing?

71
00:05:18,291 --> 00:05:20,583
That's the crazy thing.
It was warped there.

72
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:22,166
[HARRY, DEBBIE, MIRA]
What? Warped?

73
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:24,583
[KYOMA] A lot of things
are coming back to me now.

74
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:26,166
That sphere we saw.

75
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:29,333
I've actually seen it before,
the last time I was in Adrastea.

76
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:32,958
And this facility was used
for research. Space development.

77
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,791
[HARRY, DEBBIE, MIRA]
Space development? Really?

78
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:37,583
[KYOMA] That's right.
Real high-level stuff, too.

79
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:40,625
Top secret, cutting-edge
Dimension W research.

80
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:42,833
That's why they picked
such a remote location.

81
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:44,666
So, they built
rockets and satellites,

82
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:45,750
that kinda thing?

83
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:47,291
Actually, their approach
to space travel

84
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:48,541
was a little different.

85
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:51,250
It involved something
beyond defying gravity.

86
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:53,333
They were developing a way
to bring an entire base,

87
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:54,875
and all the people inside it,

88
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:58,333
into space using a
giant transporter.

89
00:05:58,416 --> 00:06:01,625
Like I said, seriously
cutting-edge stuff.

90
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:03,958
Anyway, that sphere was
a gate that appeared

91
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:06,875
when objects were transported.

92
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:09,500
Haruka Seameyer...

93
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:12,375
He's responsible for all this.
If it weren't for him,

94
00:06:12,458 --> 00:06:14,375
I'm sure the accident
wouldn't have happened.

95
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:16,375
And if the gate's open,
it tells me something.

96
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:19,833
The psycho-bastard didn't
die like he deserved to.

97
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:23,125
[DEBBIE] So why would this guy
put that weird thing on you?

98
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:24,291
[KYOMA]
I'm not sure.

99
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:26,083
He was in my dream,
or whatever it was,

100
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:28,041
talking about how my
memories were the key

101
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:31,041
[MIRA]
Your dream... The key...

102
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:32,791
Think about it.
Dreams were the trigger

103
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:35,500
in the Lake Yasogami
incident, too, weren't they?

104
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:38,125
Dreams connected the present
to the memories of the past

105
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:40,125
that were preserved
by the Numbers.

106
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:42,750
Yeah, you're right,
that is how it worked.

107
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:45,750
It's all about
dreams and memories.

108
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:47,625
[SEAMEYER] Memories are
the key to the connection

109
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:51,041
between Dimension W and
the material universe.

110
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:54,958
[footsteps tapping]

111
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:56,916
[gasps] Kyoma,
something's coming!

112
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,166
Is it a person?

113
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,083
Yes, from what I can tell,
it appears to be.

114
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:03,958
[MIRA] Although, something
seems a little off.

115
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:08,083
[gasps] What in the hell? Loo?

116
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:09,583
Loo?

117
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:13,000
Hello, Kyoma. I'm glad you came.

118
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:16,125
I mean it. Ever since
we met that time.

119
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:18,083
I've been looking
forward to seeing you...

120
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:19,166
[KYOMA]
Hey!

121

--[gears whirring]

122

Are you okay?

123
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:26,083
[gasps]

124
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:28,708
An artificial body.

125
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:30,291
So I was right.

126
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:34,208
Who is he? He has the same
Dr. Seira-style body I have.

127
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:37,125
You need to hurry.
Get out of here.

128
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:38,833
They're coming now.

129
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:43,000
[LWAI] It's my own fault
for letting my guard down.

130
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:45,291
Salva would've expected this.

131
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:48,166
He would have known there
might be assassins here.

132
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:50,416
I'm so useless.

133
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,333
All I've ever done
is hold Salva back.

134
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:55,000
[KYOMA] It doesn't matter
if most of his body

135
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:56,500
has been mechanized.

136
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:59,416
He's strong, but inside,
he's still just a kid.

137
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,833
He can't be expected
to face a pro.

138
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:03,875
[DEBBIE] Whoa, look at that!
His arm came off!

139
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:06,166
What happened, Prince?
Are you okay?

140

Let's get outta here quick.

gimme a hand with him.

Right. Please excuse me.

143

Greedy bastards.

144
00:08:13,416 --> 00:08:15,875
They're willing to go
this far for one coil?

there's dust everywhere.

multiple people.

Looks like our prey found
some friends to help him.

This hunt isn't over yet.

[LWAI]
We have to move faster.

159
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:03,666
They're going to
catch up with us.

160
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,625
You don't look so good, Papa.

161
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:08,000
It's like I've said before:
the Numbers are a problem.

162
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:10,833
They draw too much power from
your life-support system.

163
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:12,583
[LOSER]
It's fine, don't worry.

164
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:14,208
That coil is the
most important thing

165
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:16,458
for us to focus on
right now. [gasps]

166
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:26,541
Jason Chrysler!
What are you doing here?

167
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:29,166
Are you the inept
thief they call Loser?

168
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,416
[LOSER]
That is correct. I am.

169
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,125
I've been looking for you.

170
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:33,958
[LOSER] It's time for you
to get out of here, Ellie.

171
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:35,500
Do I have to?

172
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:43,166
You'd better beat him.
Good luck.

173
00:09:48,791 --> 00:09:52,500
[LOSER] You're too strong.
Those are no ordinary coils.

174
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:56,291
You're not the only
one with Numbers.

175
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:57,416
But then...

176
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,041
...you probably knew that.

177
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:01,375
You have four Numbers total--

178
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:03,208
one in each of your
arms and legs.

179
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:06,000
You call them key coils, and
your objective is to bring back

180
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:09,083
Adrastea by collecting
five of them.

181
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:11,625
[LOSER] How is it you
are so well informed?

182
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:14,125
[CHRYSLER] Well, let's just say
not everyone at New Tesla

183
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:17,458
is pleased with the recent
actions of Prince Salva.

184
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:22,166
He knew about the coil
that surpasses all Numbers.

185
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:23,750
So the real reason
he brought us here

186
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:26,875
is to locate that coil,
the same one you're after.

187
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:29,208
[LOSER] If there was one coil
that could reverse the void,

188
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:31,750
it would be that one.
It must be found.

189
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:33,875
The coil that
Dr. Yurizaki himself

190
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:36,583
deemed so dangerous
he sealed it away.

191
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:38,875
The one that Haruka Seameyer
was willing to sacrifice

192
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:40,291
everything to make.

193
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:43,166
Indeed. The one he
succeeded in making.

194
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:44,666
The ultimate coil.

195
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:48,958
Yes! And it will be found.
But you will never possess it!

196
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:53,166
[LOSER] Too much pressure.
I can't hold it back!

197
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:56,083
I have you beat, Loser.
Now disappear!

198
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:57,916
[ELIZABETH gasps]
Papa!

199
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:03,083
[ELIZABETH]
He won't last much longer!

200
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:05,208
I have to end this soon.

201
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:12,166
[LASITHI]
Prince Salva.

202
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:14,833
He's fighting even now,
I'm sure of it.

203
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:16,458
We came to this
island for a reason,

204
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:20,041
and I will continue to believe
in that possibility.

205
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:23,416
The possibility only
that coil can make real.

206
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,625
I must not lose faith.

207
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:32,208
[DEBBIE]
Another void survivor.

208
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:36,541
[MIRA]
We're being trapped!

209
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:38,666
This way, quickly!

210
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,791
[DEBBIE] That route's
being sealed off, too!

211
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:51,916
I don't like any of this.

212
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,250
Someone's controlling them.

213
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:55,125
Is it the same guy who's
after the prince?

214
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:56,958
The coils on the survivors'
heads looked like

215
00:11:57,041 --> 00:11:59,125
they reached all the way
down into their brains.

216
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:00,250
[KYOMA]
How'd they get there?

217
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:02,333
It's K.K. He's controlling them.

218
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:05,041
Yuri had the same thing
buried in his head.

219
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:06,583
Salva told me this.

220
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:08,791
People who are trapped in the
void will begin moving again

221
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:11,291
when they come in
contact with somebody.

222
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:14,583
They move, but they have
no memories and no souls.

223
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:16,916
They may look human,
but they're not.

224
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,958
[KYOMA] And what does it matter
if they have memories or souls

225
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:21,041
when somebody else
is controlling them?

226
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:22,875
[LWAI] Their bodies have
to be in good shape, though.

227
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:24,708
Otherwise they die immediately.

228
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:26,291
[K.K.]
An important point.

229
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:28,833
Fortunately, I was able to find
some in good enough condition

230
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:30,083

K.K. He's here!

232
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,916
[K.K.] Of course, I had the
help of an excellent source.

233
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,666

That's confidential information.

Ah. So you're the one, then?

That's the reason I said
this was interesting.

It looks like you're in for
a little reunion, Mabuchi.

264

Though your old comrade
may be a bit changed

survivors I found on the base

268
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:12,416
were fully functional,
but I think this one

269
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,916
should perform well enough.

270
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,625
You're not doing this just
for fun. Who hired you?

[K.K.]
I can't tell you that.

00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:21,208
But I can let you in on
the orders I was given.

273
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:22,916
They were very simple.

274
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,375
My job is to eliminate everybody

315
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:42,916
Their soul is gone.

316
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,875
What are they, then?
Empty shells?

317
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:48,750
[K.K.] It is a fact acknowledged
by Dr. Yurizaki himself.

318
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:50,166
Just as you said,
Your Highness.

319
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:51,916
The man in front of you
is an empty shell.

320
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,625
Little more than a giant doll.

321
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:54,875
No! There's no way.

322
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:56,666
He's stronger than that.
Just shut the hell up!

323
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,166
You don't know what
you're talking about.

324
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,208
[K.K.]
You're wrong.

325
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,208
Do you know how many
people I've seen

326
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:01,750
who have fallen into the void?

327
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:02,916
What?

328
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,625
I was a member of the
team put in charge

329
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:07,708
of investigating Easter Island
following the accident.

330
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:09,458
There were bodies
littering the ground.

331
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:11,541
Former humans fallen
into the void.

332
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:12,875
Most of them were collected,

333
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:16,833
though that's a fact
New Tesla chose to hide.

334
00:16:16,916 --> 00:16:18,833
When all possibilities
have been taken away,

335
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:21,333
the souls of the living
vanish with them,

336
00:16:21,416 --> 00:16:23,583
and nothing can restore them.

337
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:27,833
That was the conclusion
our team came to.

338
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:30,166
Stop it, Doug!

339
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,666
Yuri didn't fall into the void,
so he still has a soul.

340
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,750
You can return him
to his normal state!

341
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:37,250
Huh? Who's this loudmouth girl?

342
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:39,250
What you're doing
is awful! It's wrong!

343
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:42,416
[K.K.] Not a girl. A robot.
Let's get rid of it.

344
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:48,166
[MIRA gasps]

345
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,166
[DEBBIE]
We're getting sucked in!

346
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:57,375
[KYOMA]
Quick, Doug, grab hold! Come on!

347
00:16:57,458 --> 00:16:59,333
Honestly, you still
haven't figured it out?

348
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:00,541
You really are slow.

349
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:02,583
Fine, I'll tell you
one more time.

350
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:06,291
That walking pile of bones
is not your friend!

351
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:09,208
--[KYOMA grunts]
--[DOUG groans]

352
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:12,000
And I'll tell you one
more time: shut the hell up!

353
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:13,000
He was tough enough

354
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:14,333
to come back from
the void alive.

355
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:16,416
If he doesn't have
any possibilities now,

356
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,541
I'll just have to make some!

357
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:22,583
[K.K.]
Stubborn fool.

358
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:25,416
[HARRY] Whew, I thought we
were all gonna die for sure.

359
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,625
[DEBBIE]
Doesn't look like anyone else

360
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:28,208
is comin' out here to join us.

361
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:30,125
[MIRA]
We need to get back in there!

362
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:34,375
Whoa, hold on just a sec!
What's that over there?

363
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:37,500
[gasps] Some kind of light?

364
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:41,916
[KYOMA]
Doug! Hey, Doug! Wake up!

365
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,041
--[groans]
--[KYOMA] It's me! Hey!

366
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:45,083
Orders, Boss?

367
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:46,958
Good! I knew you
were alive in there!

368
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:49,958
[K.K.] I hate to ruin a touching
moment, but that's just an echo.

369
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:52,125
The events from right before
he fell into the void

370
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:55,791
were burned into his brain.
He's reacting to that stimulus.

371
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:57,458
And you just
destroyed the device

372
00:17:57,541 --> 00:18:00,541
that was allowing the
afterimage to remain.

373
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:03,375
You killed him. Or what
was left of him anyway.

374
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:04,875
No, you lie!

375
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,416
[groaning]

376
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,416
Wait! Doug!

377
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,708
[K.K.]
It's poetic, really.

378
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:10,750
You were so eager to
save him that you wound up

379
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:12,625
putting the final
nail in his coffin.

380
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:14,333
You're a dead man!

381
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:15,875
[K.K.]
Don't be too hard on yourself.

382
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:17,458
He was never coming back.

383
00:18:17,541 --> 00:18:20,166
Why did you think he would?
Because you did?

384
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:23,083
The truth is, you never
fell into the void.

385
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:24,833
Did I mention I took the
liberty of looking over

386
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:26,500
your medical records?

387
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:28,166
When you were found,
there was nothing to indicate

388
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:29,875
you'd fallen into the void.

389
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:31,625
And what's more, the place
where you were rescued

390
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:33,791
was outside the affected area.

391
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:36,166
But why does this come
as a surprise to you?

392
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:37,833
Was your memory erased?

393
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:40,541
Is that possible? My memory.

394
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:42,916
[gasps]

395
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,125
[KYOMA] There is a gaping
hole I can't fill in.

396
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:46,833
I can remember the
beginning of the mission

397
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:50,791
and bits and pieces after,
but how it all ended is lost.

398
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:53,083
I know there was
a giant transporter.

399
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:54,583
A dangerously powerful device

400
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:57,375
that Seameyer had
gained control of.

401
00:18:57,458 --> 00:19:00,625
The transporter...
Was it used on me?

402
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:02,250
Could it have sent me somewhere?

403
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:04,666
No, that's not possible.

404
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,833
The transporter wasn't
fully functional.

405
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:08,500
It could send
machines or robots,

406
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:12,291
but it wouldn't
work with humans.

407
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:14,500
Seameyer himself said
the device wasn't ready

408
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:17,583
to transport living things yet.

409
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:20,083
What was it the
commander told us?

410
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:25,500
Suppress and seize. We were
supposed to take something.

411
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:30,166
Genesis. That's it!
Genesis! Only--

412
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:32,291
What did I do with it?

413
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:35,333
Damn it. I can't remember.

414
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:39,000
[gasps]

415
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:43,458
[KYOMA]
I'm sorry.

416
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:46,125
But there's something
I need to do right now.

417
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:49,375
This island's taken
enough from me.

418
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:50,666
I'll be back for you, Doug.

419
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:53,625
I'm not leaving my comrades
behind here again.

420
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:01,791
I want you to stay here
and do what you must

421
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:05,041
to subdue our friend.
Don't kill him, though.

422
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:07,291
I believe I can find
a use for him.

423
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:09,625
[LWAI]
Call off your attack dog, K.K!

[LWAI, K.K. grunt]

425
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:12,250
I almost had you!

426
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:14,166
But almost isn't good
enough, Your Highness.

427
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:17,625
It's my turn now.
Go on, Yuri. Take him out.

428
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:27,125
[LWAI grunting]

429
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:28,333
[K.K.]
All that and you're still going?

430
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:30,208
Just how much of you is robot?

431
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:32,875
Probably everything
but your brain.

432
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:35,916
[K.K.]
You will die here.

433
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,458
And like I said before,
if you want someone to blame,

434
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:39,250
look to your brother.

435
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:40,750
[LWAI]
Blame? Never.

436
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:42,875
I feel nothing but
gratitude toward him.

437
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:46,000
Salva is my light, my beacon.
Next time I'll make him proud.

438
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:47,625
Next time?

439
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:55,583
[LWAI] I will never
forgive Salva's enemies.

440
00:20:55,666 --> 00:20:59,458
They will be punished.
That includes you.

441
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:04,291
Wha-- He did it
himself, but why?

442
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,166
No. Yuri, protect me--!

body. It's a machine!

There was almost
nothing human left.

450
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:43,250
He was modified illegally.

451

He wasn't even a person anymore!

452

Shut up and die. Bastard.

Please, stop! Just trust me!

You don't have to do this!

What?

down. It'll be okay.

you talking about?

Nothing is okay here!

466
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,666
I couldn't protect Loo,
and now look at him!

467
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:20,583
I know, but, well, Kyoma.

468
00:22:20,666 --> 00:22:22,791
You're not seeing what
you think you're seeing.

469
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:24,291
I know that you
wanted to protect him,

470
00:22:24,375 --> 00:22:26,041
