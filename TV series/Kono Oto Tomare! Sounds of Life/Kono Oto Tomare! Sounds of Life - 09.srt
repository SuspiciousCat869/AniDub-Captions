00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:44,381
But that doesn't mean we're
gonna stop trying our hardest!

165
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:45,423
[MITTSU, SANE, KOTA]
Hozuki.

166
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,425
We'll keep doing our best!

167
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,010
I can't keep up with you.

168
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:51,304
Just play by yourself.

169
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:57,185
Thanks.

170
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:05,110
[TAKEZO]
Catch up?

171
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:07,821
How do we do that?

172
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,077
[OUSUKE]
So, that's the Tokise Koto Club?

173
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:15,870
They're pretty entertaining.

174
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:18,581
It is kind of a shame they
didn't get here sooner, though.

175
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:20,333
I wanted them to hear us play.

176
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:22,293
Oh, well, one day.

177
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,421
We're not just a
group that fits together,

178
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:26,381
but an actual ensemble.

179

[SANE] Man, wasn't Himesaka's
performance amazing?

180

[TSUDA]
It goes on sale tomorrow.

181
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:33,179
[NAKAYAMA] Sounds cool,
we should check it out.

182

[TSUDA]
Kurata?

[gasps]

00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:36,641
I thought so!

How's it goin', man?

186
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:38,977
Whoa, no way!

187
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:41,229
We haven't seen you
since middle school!

[TSUDA]
Where've you been?

00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,569
You've been MIA
ever since graduation!

192
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:48,945
We were worried.

193
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:50,488
Sorry.

194
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:53,283
Of all people here,
why'd we have to run into them?

195
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:55,493
[TSUDA] Anyway, what
brings you to Meiryo High?

196
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:56,369
Oh.

197
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:58,204
It's just club stuff.

198
00:08:58,246 --> 00:08:59,539
A joint practice session.

199
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:01,875
[NAKAYAMA]
Cool! Which club?

200
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,126
It's the koto club.

201
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:04,878
[TSUDA]
Huh? What was that?

202
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:06,880
[TAKEZO]
I said the koto club.

203
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:09,883
Koto? Like the
traditional instrument?

204
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:11,760
[laughter]

205
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:13,720
[NAKAYAMA]
Are you kidding me? The koto?

206
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:16,264
That's so crazy, man!

00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:19,642
I know!

00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:25,148
What're you hyenas laughin' at?

209
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:27,192
Do you think playing
the koto is funny?

210
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:28,860
Hey, calm down, Kudo!

211
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:30,487
Kurata, who is this guy?

212
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:31,404
Shuddup!

213
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:33,073
I'll have you know this
guy's actually serious‐‐

Stop, Kudo! It's okay!

215
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:36,910
What? No, it's really not!

216
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:38,787
They made fun of you
for playin' the koto!

You can't put up with that crap!

Bye, it was good
to see you guys!

What's your problem, Specs?

00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:45,126
None of this is fine!

stupid things they're saying?

No.

00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:54,177
If anything, I'm used to it.

227
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:57,430
[CHIKA] Well, you shouldn't get
used to people laughing at you!

228
00:09:57,472 --> 00:09:59,557
Look, that's not
what I meant, Kudo.

229
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,059
It just doesn't bother me, okay?

230
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:02,185
[CHIKA]
Then act like it!

231
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:03,561
Be more confident about it!

00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:07,065
And stop laughing it off!

Jeez.

234
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:10,819
[TAKEZO]
Be more confident? How, though?

235
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:11,986
If there's something
you're holding back

236
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:14,239
or wanna talk about,
then say it.

237
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,575
Shut up already.
You wouldn't understand.

238
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:21,371
Okay, that's enough of that.

00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:24,290
There will be no fighting while
we're visiting another school.

[TAKINAMI]
Uh‐oh.

243
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:39,639
It seems you've upset one
of your underclassmen.

244
00:10:40,515 --> 00:10:42,767
Would you get off my back?

245
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:45,311
Hey. Tell me something.

246
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:48,439
Are you and the club really
aiming for nationals, Kurata?

247
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:53,987
Yeah, of course.

248
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:55,321
Something wrong with that?

249
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:58,575
[laughs]
What's with that response?

250
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:01,494
You laugh off the koto
with your old classmates,

251
00:11:01,536 --> 00:11:04,122
and you can't even
look me in the eye.

252
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:05,623
The club president
is responsible

253
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,834
for leading
everybody around him.

254
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:11,004
But here you lack even the
most basic self‐confidence.

255
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:13,590
You'll never get
to nationals like that.

256
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:15,258
[TAKINAMI]
Well,

257
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,719
it's no skin off my back
if you don't succeed.

258
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,262
Do whatever you want.

259
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:29,355
Oh. Takezo.

260
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:30,648
Were you at Meiryo?

261
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,150
What on earth
were you doing there?

262
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:34,152
Uh, I was there with my club.

263
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:36,196
[TAKERU]
Huh? You can't be serious.

264
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:39,449
You're still going on
about that stuff?

265
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:42,827
[TAKERU]
So lame.

266
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:50,835
[TAKEZO]
What should I do?

267
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:53,254
How do I become confident?

268
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:01,804
[TAKEZO] Let's try it
once more from the top.

269
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:04,807
The duet still isn't
really meshing together.

270
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:07,644
So let's try it slower.

271
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:09,562
Three, four.

272
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:13,274
[CHIKA]
Damn it.

273
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:15,235
It's no use even at this speed?

274
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:17,654
Then maybe we should try
practicing on our own.

275
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:18,363
[CHIKA]
What?

276
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,949
Well, I was thinking
it might be best

277
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,659
if we learned how to
play it better individually

278
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,869
before we try to do
the song together again.

279
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:26,079
Are you serious?

280
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:29,290
[TAKEZO] Shut up already.
You wouldn't understand.

281
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:33,211
Hey, now, hold on a second,
where are you going?

282
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:34,504
[CHIKA]
To practice alone.

283
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:35,672
I'll visualize it.

284
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,258
Should we say something?

285
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:39,133
[TAKEZO]
Sorry.

286
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:41,386
But I have to leave, too.

287
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:49,269
[TAKEZO] Even at a critical time
like this, I'm still wavering.

288
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:51,646
Tetsuki! Feed me!

289
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:52,855
Cheese Hamburg steak!

290
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:54,607
We're having pork
cutlet bowls tonight.

291
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:56,192
Boo!

292
00:12:56,234 --> 00:12:58,528
[TETSUKI]
I talked to Sane earlier.

293
00:12:58,569 --> 00:12:59,529
He's upset.

294
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:01,781
Something about how you
haven't made up with Kurata yet.

295
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:02,949
There's nothing to make up,

296
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:04,742
Four‐Eyes and I aren't
even really fighting!

297
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:07,537
He's just being his weird,
usual, glasses wearing, self.

298
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:09,330
Ah. I see.

299
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:11,207
Look, I don't know
all the details.

300
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:14,043
But he's an
upperclassman, right?

301
00:13:14,085 --> 00:13:15,336
[CHIKA]
Yeah? So?

302
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:16,754
Well, if he has a problem,

303
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:19,048
it's probably tough
for him to talk about it,

304
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:20,925
especially with
an underclassman.

305
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:23,469
Try to keep that in mind.

306
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:25,179
[CHIKA]
Sounds stupid.

307
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:26,597
You know my older brother?

308
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,892
He never tells me anything,
and he rarely confides in me.

309
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:31,477
What's with that?

310
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,147
And does that mean
there's nothing I can do?

311
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:39,402
[TAKEZO]
How do we catch up to her?

312
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:41,362
Think.

313
00:13:41,404 --> 00:13:42,405
[HIRO]
Sorry to bother you.

314
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:46,743
I'm Kurusu, Takezo's classmate
and a member of the koto club.

315
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:47,702
If you don't mind,

316
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:50,788
I have something important to
discuss with the club president.

317
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,291
Huh? Takezo's
the club president?

318
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:54,751
Uh. Kurusu?

319
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,879
Good evening! Am I intruding?

320
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:01,966
Wow, your room's
so neat and tidy.

321
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:03,968
[TAKEZO] So, is there
a reason why you're here?

322
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:06,012
Jeez, you're so uptight.

323
00:14:06,054 --> 00:14:07,180
Oh, what's this?

324
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:09,140
A DVD of koto performances?

325
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:10,099
That's right.

326
00:14:10,141 --> 00:14:12,518
I thought I'd listen to
some national performances.

327
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,811
Whoa!

328
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,772
You're serious about
this stuff, aren't you?

329
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:17,565
You're gonna go bald, Kurata!

330
00:14:17,607 --> 00:14:18,608
[TAKEZO]
Uh.

331
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:19,984
Thanks, I guess?

332
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:21,527
[HIRO]
But, you know what?

333
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:23,112
Being the club president
doesn't mean

334
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:25,740
you have to handle
everything by yourself.

335
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:28,910
So, I had a nice chat
with Suzu about it!

336
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:29,869
Starting tomorrow,

337
00:14:29,911 --> 00:14:32,663
I'll be taking over as the
koto club's vice‐president!

338
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:33,456
[TAKEZO]
Huh?

339
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:34,457
Are you serious?

340
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:35,291
That's right!

341
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:36,626
The position is available,

342
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:39,087
and it must be tough doing
everything on your own.

343
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:40,254
So if you need help
with anything,

344
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:42,340
just let me know, okay?

345
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:43,466
Sorry.

346
00:14:43,508 --> 00:14:46,386
Because I'm so unreliable,
I've made you worry.

347
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:48,971
But I don't wanna be
a burden to you‐‐

348
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,307
Cut that out, Kurata!

349
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:53,601
Listen to me. The only
burden is watching you

350
00:14:53,643 --> 00:14:55,103
try to do everything
by yourself,

351
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:57,730
and then moping around the club,
acting all sad about it!

352
00:14:57,772 --> 00:14:59,941
We can all feel that,
do you understand?

353
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:01,067
It really sucks!

354
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:03,111
Oh. I, uh...

355
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:04,362
Don't you get it?

356
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:06,739
The reason why
I wanted to join this club?

357
00:15:07,532 --> 00:15:10,159
It's because I saw kids
who had nothing in common.

358
00:15:10,201 --> 00:15:13,162
But, despite that,
they all supported each other.

359
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:14,455
And I thought...

360
00:15:14,497 --> 00:15:18,501
It was really awesome, and I
wanted to be a part of that.

361
00:15:18,543 --> 00:15:19,293
What?

362
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:20,128
But I thought you joined

363
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:22,422
because you were jealous
and wanted to mess with us.

364
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:23,339
[HIRO groans]

365
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:25,049
Um. Look, it doesn't matter!

366
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:26,259
I'm saying you don't
have to carry everything

367
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,427
on your own, okay?

368
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:28,678
Just try to have
a little more faith

369
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:30,638
in the people around
you sometimes!

370
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,974
You said, that if I was serious,

371
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:35,017
you'd be willing
to listen to me.

372
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:36,269
So I'm saying,

373
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:38,229
I'll listen to you!

374
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:42,316
Well! That concludes
my business here. Bye!

375
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:43,901
[TAKEZO]
Hey, wait! Kurusu!

376
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,361
[HIRO]
Thanks for having me!

377
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:46,988
[TAKERU]
Who was that?

378
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:48,781
Jeez, so loud.

379
00:15:48,823 --> 00:15:49,991
[TAKEZO'S MOM]
Apparently, she's a friend

380
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:52,160
from Takezo's koto club.

381
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:53,744
The koto club?

382
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:54,579
Makes sense.

383
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:57,331
Everyone in that club
seems pretty uncivilized.

384
00:15:58,332 --> 00:15:59,250
[TAKERU]
Takezo.

385
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:01,377
You should really choose
your friends better.

386
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:02,920
That's enough, young man.

387
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,714
[TAKEZO]
Takeru.

388
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:07,717
Don't ever talk about
my friends like that again.

389
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:18,811
[TAKEZO'S DAD]
Takezo.

390
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:22,064
Your mother said your
girlfriend came over today.

391
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:23,441
Uh. My what now?

392
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:24,650
[TAKEZO'S DAD]
She also told me

393
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:27,195
that you're the president
of the koto club.

394
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:28,362
Is that true?

395
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:30,907
Yeah, it is.
But I only got the position

396
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:33,784
because I was the only person
there, so it doesn't count.

397
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,036
Takezo.

398
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:37,788
Don't you dare ever
lessen your worth like that.

399
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:38,748
Weren't you the one

400
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:41,167
who worked hard on
your own to continue the club?

401
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:42,502
To get new members?

402
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:45,087
That alone is admirable.

403
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:46,339
It made me so happy

404
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:49,217
when I saw you stand up for
your friends against Takeru.

405
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:51,302
It's strange,
but you never got that upset

406
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:53,638
when he picks on you,
no matter what.

407
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,598
The moment he went
after your friends though,

408
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,350
you refused to take it anymore.

409
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:58,434
That's when I realized,

410
00:16:58,476 --> 00:17:00,770
they must be a
wonderful group of people,

411
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:03,272
I'm so glad you have them.

412
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:07,360
[TAKEZO]
Huh?

413
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:08,819
Where's Kudo?

414
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:11,280
Uh. Well, he said he's gonna do

415
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:13,783
visualization training
alone today.

416
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:15,117
[TAKEZO]
Oh.

417
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,037
Look, we're
really sorry, Takezo.

418
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:18,704
We're just not sure

419
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:21,123
what we're supposed
to do in this situation.

420
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:22,625
And if I were being
completely honest,

421
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:25,169
I think that's probably
how Chika feels too.

422
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,091
[inaudible]

423
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,720
Hey, where are you going?

424
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:36,305
[TAKEZO]
I'm such an idiot!

425
00:17:36,347 --> 00:17:37,932
I've been so focused on myself

426
00:17:37,974 --> 00:17:40,643
that I haven't been seeing
what's going on around me!

427
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:44,772
I should have known I'm not
the only person struggling.

428
00:17:44,814 --> 00:17:46,023
Up until the club,

429
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:48,276
Chika never really
bothered with other people.

430
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:50,069
And if he did get
involved with them,

431
00:17:50,111 --> 00:17:52,863
it was usually because
they were hitting one another.

432
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:55,658
So him getting angry
on someone else's behalf,

433
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,703
or even trying to understand
where they might be coming from.

434
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:01,872
Those are all feelings
he's rarely experienced.

435
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:04,417
I think Chika's
just really frustrated.

436
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,919
Because he doesn't
know how to help you.

437
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,255
[TAKEZO]
Kudo!

438
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:12,133
Listen.

439
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:15,011
[CHIKA] Not right now, I'm
doing visualization training.

440
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:18,222
It's just I'm sorry.

441
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:21,892
Meiryo was actually the school
I failed the entrance exam to.

442
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:22,810
So, the truth is,

443
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:26,063
I didn't want to go to
the joint practice session.

444
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:29,650
But then, I ignored my own
feelings and went anyway.

445
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:32,320
I was overwhelmed by
Himesaka's performance,

446
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:34,322
and I didn't know what to do.

447
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:36,407
So I ended up lashing out.

448
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:39,076
I don't possess that
much self‐confidence.

449
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,036
It was hard.

450
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:40,786
Seeing you act

451
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:44,081
so confidently in front of
everyone made me feel inferior.

452
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:46,334
And I let the club down.

453
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,627
Sorry.

454
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:50,546
I didn't say anything because
I didn't want to be a burden.

455
00:18:50,588 --> 00:18:53,007
But now I realize that you
deserve to know the truth.

456
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:54,008
It's okay.

457
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:56,594
Honestly, I don't have
a lot of faith in myself.

458
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:57,386
Still.

459
00:18:57,428 --> 00:18:58,220
I know.

460
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:00,765
There are others
who do have faith in me.

461
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:03,476
My grandpa did, anyway.

462
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:05,895
And you believed in me, too.

463
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:06,729
Huh?

464
00:19:06,771 --> 00:19:09,231
The day you got beat up
by those dumb jerks.

465
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:11,567
You believed in me.

466
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:12,652
You stood up for me

467
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:15,404
and told everyone I was
a member of the club.

468
00:19:15,446 --> 00:19:16,614
Because of that day.

469
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:19,659
Well, we're here now, aren't we?

470
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:21,911
Aren't we?

471
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:23,287
Uh, aren't we, what?

472
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:24,705
Shuddup!
Besides, the only person

473
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:26,749
who doesn't see you
as the president is you!

474
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:28,751
You can't let yourself be
bothered by something stupid

475
00:19:28,793 --> 00:19:31,253
that you can't see, like
self‐confidence, okay?

476
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:34,298
It's invisible, and if you say
you have it, you have it!

477
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:38,594
[HIRO] But, despite that,
they all supported each other.

478
00:19:38,636 --> 00:19:41,013
[TAKEZO laughs]

479
00:19:41,055 --> 00:19:41,847
I see.

480
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:42,890
Yeah.

481
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:44,558
I already had something much

482
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,894
more important
than self‐confidence.

483
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:48,604
You're right, Kudo.

484
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:56,904
Look! It's Takezo and Chika!

485
00:19:56,946 --> 00:19:59,615
See? I told you guys
they would come back.

486
00:19:59,657 --> 00:20:00,533
What's wrong?

487
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:01,200
[KOTA]
Nothing!

488
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:03,035
Does this mean you
two have made up?

489
00:20:03,077 --> 00:20:05,246
What? But we weren't
even fighting.

490
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:06,580
[SANE]
Whatever you say, man.

491
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:08,541
Well, thanks to your
little friendship spat,

492
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:10,751
now everyone's behind
on our schedule.

493
00:20:10,793 --> 00:20:11,502
Right?

494
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:12,086
[SATOWA]
Indeed.

495
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:14,255
Looks like we'll have to
reinstate morning practice.

496
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:15,381
[MITTSU]
Aw, really?

497
00:20:15,423 --> 00:20:16,424
[SATOWA]
Really.

498
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:17,925
[HIRO]
What time should we be here?

499
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:19,719
[SATOWA]
Let's shoot for seven AM.

500
00:20:23,264 --> 00:20:24,432
[TAKEZO]
Hey, guys?

501
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:26,559
Listen, I think it
may be impossible

502
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,478
for us to get to Nationals.

503
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:33,816
Himesaka, Kanagawa's number one,
is clearly better than us.

504
00:20:33,858 --> 00:20:36,235
And I doubt we can
ever surpass them...

505
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:38,821
...at least, at this rate.

506
00:20:38,863 --> 00:20:41,949
Even if we put in the same
amount of effort as Himesaka,

507
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:43,951
we'll never catch up to them.

508
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:45,995
No matter how much
we want it.

509
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:48,414
We might still be left crying.

510
00:20:48,456 --> 00:20:49,248
Still though,

511
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:50,958
I'd like to aim for Nationals.

512
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,501
With everyone in this room!

513
00:20:52,543 --> 00:20:54,545
More than anything else.

514
00:20:58,257 --> 00:20:59,175
[CHIKA]
Hey, Specs.

515
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:00,468
I'm taking this down.

516
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:01,969
[TAKEZO]
Why?

517
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:05,139
Okay. We all write
one word each.

518
00:21:05,181 --> 00:21:06,682
Huh? What's this gonna do?

519
00:21:06,724 --> 00:21:07,850
Don't worry about it.

520
00:21:07,892 --> 00:21:10,019
Just have a little faith.

521
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,938
Here, I think the
president should go first.

522
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:17,985
[TAKEZO]
I'm done hiding.

523
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:19,820
No more laughing it off.

524
00:21:21,155 --> 00:21:23,240
Battles you know you're
gonna win aren't much fun.

525
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:25,075
I like a challenge.

526
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:27,828
It might feel impossible
if we were all working alone,

527
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:29,246
but we're in this together.

528
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:33,292
Hard work's not really my forte,
but I promise to do my best!

529
00:21:33,334 --> 00:21:34,210
Here you go, Hiro!

530
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:35,294
[HIRO]
Thanks!

531
00:21:35,336 --> 00:21:37,379
Oh, I might have forgotten
to mention this fact,

532
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:39,548
but I'm gonna be the
club's vice‐president.

533
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:40,508
Let's do this!

534
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:41,675
[SANE, KOTA, MITTSU]
Huh?

535
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:42,551
[HIRO]
Here Hozuki.

536
00:21:42,593 --> 00:21:45,262
It's your turn to add
a word to the poster next.

537
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:46,764
You know it's funny,

538
00:21:46,806 --> 00:21:48,974
but this used to be
what I was working towards.

539
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:51,727
Doing it alone though
would have been impossible.

540
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:53,646
But now I've got you guys.

541
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:55,147
Right?

542
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:56,816
Personally, if you ask me,

543
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:59,568
having a goal that seems
out of reach is more fun.

544
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:04,240
[CHIKA]
Okay, tell me if it's crooked.

545
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:05,699
[SANE]
Move it to the right a little.

546
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:07,618
[MITTSU]
There! That's perfect.

547
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,997
[CHIKA]
'Kay! It's finished!

548
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:59,855
[SATOWA]
Next time: "Near Yet Far."
