1
00:01:51,858 --> 00:01:54,442
We don't even have practice.

2
00:01:54,525 --> 00:01:57,358
We lost yesterday.

3
00:01:57,442 --> 00:01:58,650
And what's worse,

4
00:01:58,733 --> 00:02:01,567
to a school whose
performance we didn't hear.

5
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:04,567
And now I know that
you can become even better.

6
00:02:11,067 --> 00:02:12,567
[CHIKA]
It isn't locked?

7
00:02:15,317 --> 00:02:16,775
[CHIKA]
Why are you here?

8
00:02:16,858 --> 00:02:18,108
Isn't that my line?

9
00:02:18,192 --> 00:02:20,025
There isn't any practice today.

10
00:02:20,108 --> 00:02:20,733
[SANE]
Yeah.

11
00:02:20,817 --> 00:02:22,650
But here's the thing.

12
00:02:22,733 --> 00:02:25,317
We've been practicing
the koto day in and day out.

13
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,400
Yeah, I guess we
don't really know

14
00:02:26,483 --> 00:02:28,233
what to do with ourselves now.

15
00:02:28,317 --> 00:02:29,775
You guys.

16
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:33,025
All right, so I guess it's back
to business as usual, then.

17
00:02:33,108 --> 00:02:36,150
Our next competition is
the national qualifier, right?

18
00:02:36,233 --> 00:02:37,400
What are we gonna play?

19
00:02:37,483 --> 00:02:39,567
[TAKEZO] We could always
practice "Kuon" more.

20
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:41,442
Or maybe even learn a new song.

21
00:02:41,525 --> 00:02:42,525
[TAKINAMI]
Wow.

22
00:02:42,608 --> 00:02:44,233
What are all of you doing here?

23
00:02:44,317 --> 00:02:46,358
Don't you have
lives outside of koto?

24
00:02:46,442 --> 00:02:47,775
[TAKEZO]
Mister Takinami.

25
00:02:47,858 --> 00:02:48,733
What's up?

26
00:02:48,817 --> 00:02:49,983
[TAKINAMI]
Not much.

27
00:02:50,067 --> 00:02:51,317
Oh. Here.

28
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,150
[TAKEZO]
Hm?

29
00:02:53,233 --> 00:02:54,567
Sheet music?

30
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:56,442
[TAKINAMI] It's a medley
of a few different pieces

31
00:02:56,525 --> 00:02:59,067
that have been popular lately.

32
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:02,192
Your next performance is the
school festival in September.

33
00:03:02,275 --> 00:03:03,400
I want you to play this piece.

34
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:04,025
Huh?

35
00:03:04,108 --> 00:03:05,442
The truth is,

36
00:03:05,525 --> 00:03:07,775
you guys lack any real
experience performing in public,

37
00:03:07,858 --> 00:03:10,775
so you need to take every
opportunity to perform.

38
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:14,192
Why the silence?

39
00:03:14,275 --> 00:03:16,900
You sound like
an actual club advisor.

40
00:03:16,983 --> 00:03:19,067
I am a club advisor.

41
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:20,483
I can't believe it!

42
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:23,150
Hold on, so this is an
arrangement of popular songs?

43
00:03:23,233 --> 00:03:25,608
I don't get it, where'd you
find sheet music for this?

44
00:03:25,692 --> 00:03:27,608
[TAKINAMI]
I had to write it.

45
00:03:27,692 --> 00:03:29,525
Oh that's nice of you.

46
00:03:29,608 --> 00:03:32,067
[SATOWA]
It even has koto notations.

47
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:32,942
[ALL 3]
What?

48
00:03:33,025 --> 00:03:34,067
You wrote it?

49
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:35,983
Wait, like you you
or a different you?

50
00:03:36,067 --> 00:03:37,983
Yeah, that doesn't
make sense, Kurata.

51
00:03:38,067 --> 00:03:41,150
But this is a music piece with
a koto notation and everything!

52
00:03:41,233 --> 00:03:43,067
And you said that you
didn't know the koto!

53
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:45,442
Look, I've been the club
advisor for a good two years,

54
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:48,483
even I should be able to read
and write a koto score by now.

55
00:03:49,733 --> 00:03:51,358
Okay. That's kinda cool.

56
00:03:51,442 --> 00:03:52,858
I agree.

57
00:03:52,942 --> 00:03:55,525
Hey, if a non-koto player
can do it, maybe we can, too!

58
00:03:55,608 --> 00:03:56,858
You definitely cannot!

59
00:03:56,942 --> 00:03:58,233
Yeah, that's not normal!

60
00:03:58,317 --> 00:04:00,067
[TAKEZO]
Mr. Takinami, I...

61
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:02,067
Please don't make this
about me, okay?

62
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:03,442
Focus.

63
00:04:03,525 --> 00:04:05,483
This score has three parts:
a first and second koto,

64
00:04:05,567 --> 00:04:07,650
and a part for the 17-string.

65
00:04:07,733 --> 00:04:10,733
I've written the part for the
17-string so it's simpler.

66
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:12,983
This time I would like
for Adachi to play it.

67
00:04:13,067 --> 00:04:13,983
Sound good?

68
00:04:14,067 --> 00:04:15,525
Really? Why me?

69
00:04:15,608 --> 00:04:17,358
[TAKINAMI] You have a pretty
good sense of rhythm and power,

70
00:04:17,442 --> 00:04:19,733
so you're suited for it.

71
00:04:21,608 --> 00:04:23,525
The school festival's
in a month.

72
00:04:23,608 --> 00:04:24,942
We still have lots of time.

73
00:04:25,025 --> 00:04:28,025
You can use it to pick
a piece for the qualifier.

74
00:04:28,108 --> 00:04:30,150
I'll keep my eye out
for something.

75
00:04:30,233 --> 00:04:32,108
But seeing as you have
a keen ear for music,

76
00:04:32,192 --> 00:04:34,108
you should look
around too, Hozuki.

77
00:04:34,192 --> 00:04:35,483
Right.

78
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:37,150
Make sure to practice.

79
00:04:39,317 --> 00:04:41,483
Wow, okay that was super weird.

80
00:04:41,567 --> 00:04:43,733
What the heck's
going on with Suzu?

81
00:04:43,817 --> 00:04:47,233
Um. I don't know.

82
00:04:47,317 --> 00:04:48,858
But...

83
00:04:50,108 --> 00:04:51,692
[TAKINAMI]
Oh, one more thing,

84
00:04:51,775 --> 00:04:55,067
make sure you guys finish up
all of your summer assignments.

85
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:56,942
If you get in trouble with
the vice principal again,

86
00:04:57,025 --> 00:04:59,983
he might not let you participate
in the school festival.

87
00:05:00,483 --> 00:05:01,775
What summer assignments?

88
00:05:01,858 --> 00:05:03,567
Wait, we had homework?

89
00:05:06,317 --> 00:05:08,608
I can understand
your nervous reaction.

90
00:05:08,692 --> 00:05:10,025
But don't you worry.

91
00:05:10,108 --> 00:05:11,775
When it comes to
emergencies like this one,

92
00:05:11,858 --> 00:05:14,025
we've got the
ultimate secret weapon!

93
00:05:14,108 --> 00:05:15,442
Huh?

94
00:05:15,525 --> 00:05:18,233
[KOTA, MITTSU, SANE]
Thank you for helping us again!

95
00:05:18,317 --> 00:05:21,442
[TAKEZO] Uh, I'm sorry for
tagging along too, Takaoka.

96
00:05:21,525 --> 00:05:22,942
[TETSUKI]
Actually, I appreciate it.

97
00:05:23,025 --> 00:05:24,942
These guys can be
a lot to handle alone,

98
00:05:25,025 --> 00:05:27,983
so I could use
your help tutoring them.

99
00:05:28,067 --> 00:05:29,733
[TAKEZO]
It's kinda weird,

100
00:05:29,817 --> 00:05:32,983
but I didn't expect him
to be their secret weapon.

101
00:05:33,067 --> 00:05:35,275
Our friend Tetsuki
is practically a genius.

102
00:05:35,358 --> 00:05:36,400
He's the reason we were able

103
00:05:36,483 --> 00:05:38,233
to get into Tokise
in the first place.

104
00:05:38,317 --> 00:05:40,650
Yep, he got the highest score
on the entrance exam.

105
00:05:40,733 --> 00:05:42,233
[TAKEZO]
What?

106
00:05:42,317 --> 00:05:44,608
Okay then, we should probably
knock out the math stuff first.

107
00:05:44,692 --> 00:05:46,650
[KOTA, MITTSU, SANE]
Yes, sir!

108
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:53,650
Yeah, here's the thing, Tetsuki.

109
00:05:53,733 --> 00:05:56,108
I don't think my math textbook
is feeling so hot at the moment,

110
00:05:56,192 --> 00:05:57,733
so maybe we should focus
on a different subject

111
00:05:57,817 --> 00:05:59,067
for the time being.

112
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,858
Uh, I think you're the one
who's not feeling well.

113
00:06:06,275 --> 00:06:08,067
I'm not gonna make it;
go on without me.

114
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:09,358
Math makes me hungry.

115
00:06:09,442 --> 00:06:10,483
Jeez, already?

116
00:06:10,567 --> 00:06:12,150
I mean, what's
the deal with X and Y?

117
00:06:12,233 --> 00:06:13,483
Why are they
hiding their identities

118
00:06:13,567 --> 00:06:15,275
instead of just living
more confidently?

119
00:06:15,358 --> 00:06:16,442
Stop being so shy!

120
00:06:16,525 --> 00:06:17,775
Listen up you two,

121
00:06:17,858 --> 00:06:19,442
you aren't fooling us
with that dumb act, okay?

122
00:06:19,525 --> 00:06:20,775
[TAKEZO]
Wow.

123
00:06:20,858 --> 00:06:23,317
They certainly are a
challenging group to teach.

124
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,317
I wonder how Takaoka does it.

125
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,525
[TETSUKI]
So that's it then,

126
00:06:27,608 --> 00:06:28,942
you're just gonna turn
your backs on them?

127
00:06:29,025 --> 00:06:30,942
I feel bad for X amd Y.

128
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:34,358
Hold on.

129
00:06:34,442 --> 00:06:35,692
What do you mean?

130
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:37,525
They've been forced
to conceal their identities

131
00:06:37,608 --> 00:06:39,858
since birth and
live in solitude.

132
00:06:39,942 --> 00:06:41,233
The poor things are unable

133
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:44,233
to reveal their true selves
to anyone or anything.

134
00:06:44,317 --> 00:06:45,483
And to make matters worse,

135
00:06:45,567 --> 00:06:47,692
now you guys are turning
your backs on them, too.

136
00:06:47,775 --> 00:06:48,900
How pitiful.

137
00:06:50,775 --> 00:06:52,733
They're outcasts, like us.

138
00:06:52,817 --> 00:06:55,067
Living alone.

139
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:57,358
[KOTA, MITTSU, SANE]
Aw, poor X! Poor Y!

140
00:06:57,442 --> 00:06:59,192
Please forgive us.
No matter what happens,

141
00:06:59,275 --> 00:07:01,192
we won't ever turn
our backs on you guys!

142
00:07:01,275 --> 00:07:03,525
Yeah, that's right, we're
gonna stick to you like glue!

143
00:07:05,108 --> 00:07:06,525
Hey, Mister Tetsuki,

144
00:07:06,608 --> 00:07:09,442
you gotta tell me how to save
X from its solitude, okay?

145
00:07:09,525 --> 00:07:12,067
Mister Takezo,
teach me how to help Y!

146
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:24,733
[TAKEZO] It's kinda nice to
spend time with them like this.

147
00:07:26,608 --> 00:07:28,150
[ALL sigh]

148
00:07:28,233 --> 00:07:31,150
[SANE] And that
wraps up the English part!

149
00:07:31,233 --> 00:07:32,150
Tetsuki.

150
00:07:32,233 --> 00:07:33,900
Yeah, what?

151
00:07:33,983 --> 00:07:35,108
I'm getting hungry!

152
00:07:35,192 --> 00:07:36,858
Feed me.

153
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:40,108
[TAKEZO]
You need some help?

154
00:07:40,192 --> 00:07:42,358
Sure, that'd be nice.

155
00:07:42,442 --> 00:07:43,692
Let's see.

156
00:07:43,775 --> 00:07:45,317
You think you can handle
washing those vegetables?

157
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,358
[TAKEZO]
Yeah, you got it.

158
00:07:50,067 --> 00:07:51,483
You know what?

159
00:07:51,567 --> 00:07:53,525
I think you've got a real knack
for teaching other people.

160
00:07:53,608 --> 00:07:55,650
Man, you're so good at it.

161
00:07:55,733 --> 00:07:57,108
You think so?

162
00:07:57,192 --> 00:07:59,650
What made you wanna
go to Tokise, anyway?

163
00:07:59,733 --> 00:08:02,442
Couldn't you have
gone somewhere better?

164
00:08:02,525 --> 00:08:04,817
Uh...

165
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,400
I don't really have a reason.

166
00:08:06,483 --> 00:08:09,233
It's just close to where I live
and seemed like a fun school.

167
00:08:09,317 --> 00:08:11,233
That's all.

168
00:08:11,317 --> 00:08:12,233
I see.

169
00:08:12,317 --> 00:08:14,442
[CHIKA]
Hey, Four-Eyes!

170
00:08:14,525 --> 00:08:15,650
Why are you in the kitchen?

171
00:08:15,733 --> 00:08:18,025
We need someone
to come help teach us.

172
00:08:18,108 --> 00:08:18,608
[TAKEZO]
Oh.

173
00:08:18,692 --> 00:08:20,192
Right, sorry.

174
00:08:20,275 --> 00:08:22,858
[TETSUKI] You shouldn't call an
upperclassman names, it's rude.

175
00:08:22,942 --> 00:08:24,150
Shut up.

176
00:08:24,233 --> 00:08:24,942
[TAKEZO]
Well.

177
00:08:25,025 --> 00:08:26,483
He's respectful sometimes.

178
00:08:26,567 --> 00:08:28,358
Once he even called me "sir."

179
00:08:28,442 --> 00:08:29,067
Still though.

180
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:30,192
That was a while ago.

181
00:08:30,275 --> 00:08:32,025
That's enough, ya twerp!

182
00:08:33,442 --> 00:08:34,483
But you know what.

183
00:08:34,567 --> 00:08:35,858
The truth is...

184
00:08:35,942 --> 00:08:37,692
But if there's a problem
you can't solve,

185
00:08:37,775 --> 00:08:39,900
then we'll work it out together.

186
00:08:39,983 --> 00:08:41,025
Mizuhara.

187
00:08:41,108 --> 00:08:43,150
You don't have
to rush yourself, okay?

188
00:08:43,233 --> 00:08:45,775
You're actually a
pretty good club president.

189
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:46,692
Me?

190
00:08:46,775 --> 00:08:49,067
Yeah, just think about it.

191
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:52,150
Like when Hozuki told us
about her home life.

192
00:08:52,233 --> 00:08:53,275
You see.

193
00:08:53,358 --> 00:08:55,733
I was excommunicated
from the school.

194
00:08:55,817 --> 00:08:57,400
In that case,

195
00:08:57,483 --> 00:08:58,525
thanks for sharing!

196
00:08:58,608 --> 00:09:00,108
Really.

197
00:09:00,192 --> 00:09:02,275
[CHIKA] In that moment, I feel
like that's probably the thing

198
00:09:02,358 --> 00:09:04,525
she needed
to hear the most.

199
00:09:04,608 --> 00:09:08,567
And you said it without
any hesitation whatsoever.

200
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:11,358
I've never been good
with stuff like that.

201
00:09:15,483 --> 00:09:17,608
I'm not really sure
why you're cryin' right now.

202
00:09:17,692 --> 00:09:20,608
I'm not, the onion is just
making my eyes water!

203
00:09:20,692 --> 00:09:22,067
[TETSUKI]
You haven't even cut it yet.

204
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,442
[CHIKA] Whatever,
let's get back to studyin'.

205
00:09:25,525 --> 00:09:26,733
Dumbass.

206
00:09:26,817 --> 00:09:28,483
I can handle the cooking.

207
00:09:28,567 --> 00:09:29,525
Go help 'em.

208
00:09:29,608 --> 00:09:31,733
Okay, if you're sure.

209
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,025
[TETSUKI]
Kurata.

210
00:09:34,108 --> 00:09:35,692
Thank you.

211
00:09:37,692 --> 00:09:38,983
When Chika first told me

212
00:09:39,067 --> 00:09:41,317
that he'd decided to join
the koto club at school,

213
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,608
I thought it would be
a big challenge for him.

214
00:09:43,692 --> 00:09:48,275
I thought he might be rejected
by the other club members.

215
00:09:48,358 --> 00:09:50,442
But it looks like I was wrong.

216
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,817
I guess.

217
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:56,650
I'm thanking you for
preserving the koto club.

218
00:09:56,733 --> 00:09:59,942
That place has helped
Chika find himself again.

219
00:10:05,275 --> 00:10:07,692
[TAKEZO]
If anything, he's helped me.

220
00:10:10,317 --> 00:10:14,400
He was there because he's
a new member of the koto club.

221
00:10:14,483 --> 00:10:16,317
Of course he'd
be in the club room!

222
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,900
We are members of
the same club, after all.

223
00:10:18,983 --> 00:10:21,608
I refuse to lose the friends
who are precious to me,

224
00:10:21,692 --> 00:10:23,400
or the place where I belong.

225
00:10:23,483 --> 00:10:24,817
So we're going to play now.

226
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,983
But now I realize that
you deserve to know the truth.

227
00:10:27,067 --> 00:10:28,483
Then what?

228
00:10:28,567 --> 00:10:29,692
Would you rather quit?

229
00:10:29,775 --> 00:10:32,775
Let's make this our
best performance ever!

230
00:10:36,567 --> 00:10:39,692
[KOTA, MITTSU, SANE]
Whoa! It looks great!

231
00:10:41,108 --> 00:10:42,942
So good!

232
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,108
[CHIKA] Tetsuki's curry is
the best curry in the world.

233
00:10:47,192 --> 00:10:48,775
I appreciate that.

234
00:10:48,858 --> 00:10:50,942
Though I wish I could
have let it stand for a day.

235
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:52,317
[CHIKA]
So make it again tomorrow!

236
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,900
Wait, are you guys staying over?

237
00:10:53,983 --> 00:10:55,817
That's not a problem, is it?

238
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:58,067
Well, you could have
at least asked me first.

239
00:10:58,150 --> 00:10:59,567
[MITTSU, CHIKA, SANE]
Seconds, please!

240
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:01,025
Already?

241
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,775
The son of Kaoru Takinami
and Tsukasa Yukimori?

242
00:11:06,858 --> 00:11:07,942
That's what I heard.

243
00:11:08,025 --> 00:11:09,817
Are they like a big deal
or something?

244
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,317
[TAKEZO]
What? You didn't know?

245
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:14,483
He's a world-renowned conductor,
and she's a piano prodigy!

246
00:11:14,567 --> 00:11:15,692
They're famous?

247
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:17,067
That's right.

248
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:18,733
Even I know about them.

249
00:11:18,817 --> 00:11:20,733
But it explains Mister Takinami,

250
00:11:20,817 --> 00:11:22,817
and why he has
a good ear for music.

251
00:11:24,275 --> 00:11:25,400
So when he told us

252
00:11:25,483 --> 00:11:27,108
that our performance
was good the other day,

253
00:11:27,192 --> 00:11:28,483
he must have really meant it,

254
00:11:28,567 --> 00:11:30,692
seeing as he knows so
much about music and stuff.

255
00:11:30,775 --> 00:11:32,817
Now I feel super proud of us.

256
00:11:35,858 --> 00:11:36,650
[TETSUKI]
Heh.

257
00:11:36,733 --> 00:11:38,317
Good for you.

I'm more excited than ever!

Let's hurry and get
caught up on our homework!

260
00:11:45,567 --> 00:11:47,692
[CHIKA] Tetsuki, you said we
could trade assignments, right?

261
00:11:47,775 --> 00:11:49,358
[TETSUKI]
Yeah, hard pass.

Are you serious?

It's only been like two weeks.

Don't underestimate my skills.

267
00:12:07,983 --> 00:12:10,775
You shouldn't rush it, or
you might hurt it even worse.

00:12:10,858 --> 00:12:12,358
What's this?

269
00:12:12,442 --> 00:12:14,067
It's been a long time since I've
seen you wear your hair down.

270
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,067
[SATOWA]
So? Is that weird or something?

271
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:18,358
[CHIKA] Nah, it doesn't
matter either way.

272
00:12:19,358 --> 00:12:20,608
Oh. I see.

273
00:12:20,692 --> 00:12:21,942
Why are you upset?

00:12:22,025 --> 00:12:24,858
This is just
my resting expression.

[2-A CLASS REP]
And thanks to a majority vote,

it's decided that
we'll do a waffle booth

00:12:29,983 --> 00:12:31,817
at the school festival!

278

Next we'll assign

I'm really sorry.

Why? It's not
like you planned it.

No fair, why do I have
to be stuck on this team

with all these boring people?

Wow, rude.

Excuse you?

Admit it, you've become
super boring lately.

Remember when you
used to make fun of Kurata

by calling him all
those girly nicknames?

00:14:08,067 --> 00:14:09,025
They couldn't
believe a delinquent

321
00:14:09,108 --> 00:14:10,942
would suggest such a thing.

322
00:14:11,025 --> 00:14:12,692
They weren't sure how to react.

323
00:14:12,775 --> 00:14:13,858
What's your class doing?

324
00:14:13,942 --> 00:14:16,525
A good ol'
classic haunted house!

325
00:14:16,608 --> 00:14:18,858
I'd expect you three to be
excited about participating

326
00:14:18,942 --> 00:14:21,942
in the school festival,
but Chika's a surprise.

327
00:14:22,025 --> 00:14:23,358
And you're performing?

328
00:14:23,442 --> 00:14:24,942
That's right.

329
00:14:25,025 --> 00:14:26,942
Before I played it, I thought
it was probably a lame medley,

330
00:14:27,025 --> 00:14:29,275
but it actually turned out
to be a pretty cool piece.

331
00:14:29,358 --> 00:14:32,150
For sure, Mister Takinami's
parents may be amazing,

332
00:14:32,233 --> 00:14:35,233
but I gotta give the
guy credit where it's due.

333
00:14:35,317 --> 00:14:36,775
Like the other day.

334
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:39,483
[TAKINAMI]
These are music CDs and DVDs

335
00:14:39,567 --> 00:14:41,442
that I don't think
you'd normally listen to.

336
00:14:41,525 --> 00:14:43,567
I want you to
listen to all of them.

337
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:44,567
[KOTA, MITTSU, SANE]
What?

338
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,400
But this is a mountain of music.

339
00:14:46,483 --> 00:14:48,525
[TAKINAMI] It's a fraction
of my initial picks.

340
00:14:48,608 --> 00:14:50,733
Fact of the matter is,
the amount of music you guys

341
00:14:50,817 --> 00:14:54,150
come in contact with
is overwhelmingly small.

342
00:14:54,233 --> 00:14:56,150
You need to listen to
a large variety of music

343
00:14:56,233 --> 00:14:57,692
as often as possible.

344
00:14:57,775 --> 00:15:00,192
Learn the different
sounds and expressions.

345
00:15:00,275 --> 00:15:01,817
Absorb them into yourselves.

346
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,858
It'll help develop
your musicality.

347
00:15:03,942 --> 00:15:05,942
I guarantee that
when you do those things,

348
00:15:06,025 --> 00:15:08,733
playing the koto
will be a lot more fun.

349
00:15:08,817 --> 00:15:10,483
Well, then, make sure
you listen to them.

350

Wait, Mister Takinami!

Aren't you going
to help us prepare?

[TAKINAMI] After you listen
to my recommendations.

And ever since that fateful day,

we've been listening to
the giant mountain of music.

Since the two of you

Oh, hey, aren't there more guys

I'm seeing a guy

[HIRO laughs]
That's hilarious.

383
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,233
It's pretty normal

to increase after summer,

something wrong with me?

00:20:00,358 --> 00:20:00,983
Right.

478
00:20:01,067 --> 00:20:02,525
Let's go shopping.

479
00:20:02,608 --> 00:20:04,233
Come on.

480
00:20:06,567 --> 00:20:08,483
[HIRO]
Crap.

481
00:20:08,567 --> 00:20:10,358
It's so loud.

482
00:20:10,442 --> 00:20:14,317
Why is my heart... pounding?

483
00:20:17,025 --> 00:20:19,400
So, uh, what are you making?

484
00:20:19,483 --> 00:20:21,025
Huh? You can't tell?

485
00:20:21,108 --> 00:20:23,108
It should be fairly obvious.

486
00:20:23,192 --> 00:20:26,692
It's the café menu to
put outside our classroom.

487
00:20:26,775 --> 00:20:29,317
[CHIKA]
Hmm... And what's that?

488
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,358
[SATOWA]
A teacup drawing.

489
00:20:31,442 --> 00:20:32,525
[CHIKA]
And this?

490
00:20:32,608 --> 00:20:35,900
[SATOWA]
A strawberry <i>daifuku</i> .

491
00:20:35,983 --> 00:20:38,733
[laughs]

492
00:20:38,817 --> 00:20:39,858
I see.

493
00:20:39,942 --> 00:20:41,817
Who knew you were
such an artist, huh?

494
00:20:43,358 --> 00:20:45,733
Whoa. Did Kudo just laugh?

495
00:20:48,483 --> 00:20:50,858
Do I even wanna know
what you're doing?

496
00:20:50,942 --> 00:20:51,692
[SATOWA]
Uh...

497
00:20:51,775 --> 00:20:53,608
Uh... Well...

498
00:20:53,692 --> 00:20:55,275
Nothing!

499
00:20:55,358 --> 00:20:56,525
Seriously?

500
00:20:56,608 --> 00:20:58,733
What am I doing?

501
00:20:58,817 --> 00:21:01,400
[CHIKA] I feel like this base
board is way too distorted.

502
00:21:01,483 --> 00:21:04,525
It's the only extra
wood I could find!

503
00:21:04,608 --> 00:21:05,983
I'll fix it for you.

504
00:21:06,067 --> 00:21:07,525
Hand me that tool.

505
00:21:07,608 --> 00:21:08,358
[SATOWA]
Watch out!

506
00:21:08,442 --> 00:21:10,025
There's a nail right there!

507
00:21:17,733 --> 00:21:20,525
[screams] I'm sorry,
that was my bad!

508
00:21:20,608 --> 00:21:22,067
Don't get the
wrong idea or anything!

509
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:23,900
It was just an accident, okay?

510
00:21:23,983 --> 00:21:25,483
No harm, no foul!

511
00:21:25,567 --> 00:21:28,983
But... I was the one who
moved forward so suddenly.

512
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:32,942
Huh?

513
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:33,942
What the...?

514
00:21:34,025 --> 00:21:36,108
Am I...?

515
00:21:36,192 --> 00:21:37,275
Sorry!

516
00:21:37,358 --> 00:21:40,275
Wait. Hozuki, stop!

517
00:21:40,358 --> 00:21:42,275
I made her cry.

518
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:49,025
[SATOWA]
My face feels hot.

519
00:21:49,108 --> 00:21:51,025
What should I do?

520
00:21:53,775 --> 00:21:55,900
[SATOWA]
Why is it so hot?

521
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:06,733
[laughs]
Look how scary my mask is!

522
00:22:06,817 --> 00:22:08,608
Let's put some
more fake blood on it!

523
00:22:08,692 --> 00:22:10,900
[laughter]

524
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:54,400
[TAKEZO]
Next time: "Their Time."
