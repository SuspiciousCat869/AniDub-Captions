We're standing on this stage

because you chose to
challenge us as a club.

[SHIZU] This is the very
last koto that Gen made

before he passed.

86
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:01,301
Back when your grandfather's
house was broken into,

87
00:05:01,343 --> 00:05:04,429
I took over the repairs and
care of his instruments.

88
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:07,849
This koto was the only one
that survived the incident.

Isn't it beautiful?

90
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:11,686
This is what we call a
straight‐grained koto,

91
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:13,647
crafted from well‐aged wood.

92
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:16,316
It's a real work of art,
made from high‐quality wood

93
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:19,027
by the most talented koto
maker I've ever known.

94
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:22,656
It's sound is gentle, but deep,
with long‐lingering tones.

95
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:26,076
The koto is actually what we
might call a consumable good.

96
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:28,954
Over time, it's sound changes
the more it's played,

97
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:31,331
and when it passes
it's peak, it withers.

98
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:33,583
In my opinion,
there's nothing more tragic

99
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:36,586
than an instrument withering
before it's ever been played.

100
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:38,463
That's why I'm glad
to pass it on to you

00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:40,048
before that can happen.

102
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:42,592
Play it to your heart's content.

103
00:05:42,634 --> 00:05:44,719
[CHIKA]
If it's such an incredible koto,

104
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:47,973

someone more reliable than me.

Oh? What kind of
person would that be?

Y'know, someone who really
gets the koto or whatever!

Someone who's good at playing!

108
00:05:57,816 --> 00:05:59,776
Your playing is at
a beginner's level

109
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:02,654
and I wouldn't dare say it's
at the point of being "good."

110
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:05,615
But your sound is far
gentler than anyone else's.

I'm sure that it was
able to reach Gen.

159
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:02,107
What's his deal?

160
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:04,985
Yeah, he's...
kind of our advisor.

161
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:07,237
[ALL]
Uhh, that guy?

162
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:09,030
The club was never
too much work.

163
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:11,074
I could always take it easy.

164
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:12,742
I'd thought it'd just fold.

165
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:15,662
But the vice principal's
all excited now.

166
00:08:15,704 --> 00:08:16,913
What a pain.

167
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:17,914
"A pain"?

168
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:20,208
Look, Nationals are
nothing but a pipe dream.

169
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,002
It's time to be more realistic.

170
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:23,378
Give it up.

171
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,839
[CHIKA] Bastard!
You tryin' to pick a fight?

172
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,382
That's more like it, Kudo.

173
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:29,843
This suits you better than
that goody‐two‐shoes act.

174
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:30,760
Huh?!

175
00:08:30,802 --> 00:08:31,720
[TAKINAMI]
While we're at it,

176
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:34,180
what's a girl like
you even doing here?

177
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:36,016
You're on a different level.

178
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:39,602
If you stay in this pathetic
club, you'll only get worse.

179
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:42,522
That's enough, Mister Takinami!

180
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:45,316
Well, I'll be checking in
on you every so often.

181
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,444
Try not to cause me any trouble.

182
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,572
What is his problem?

183
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:53,783
[KOTA, SANE, MITTSU]
Whoa! Calm down, Chika!

184
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:56,244
[TAKINAMI] How long are
you guys gonna cry for?

185
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:58,204
[ALL crying]

186
00:08:58,246 --> 00:08:59,789
Don't tell me that
you actually thought

187
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:02,709
a weak performance like that
would get you all to Nationals.

188
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:03,501
Hold on!

189
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,462
You don't have to be
so cruel about it.

190
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:07,756
All I'm saying is it
wasn't the sound of people

191
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:09,549
truly aiming for Nationals.

192
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:11,009
That's why you failed.

193
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:13,303
It's as simple as that.

194
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:15,096
[TAKEZO] We were finally
on the same page

195
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:16,639
and the club was going well.

196
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:18,391
[sighs]

197
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:20,727
What? Are you serious, Hiro?

198
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:22,062
[HIRO]
Yep, sure am.

199
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:24,731
To be honest, I've gotten
kinda excited about the idea of

200
00:09:24,773 --> 00:09:26,691
"friends" and
"a place to belong."

201
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:28,276
You're only young once, right?

202
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:29,652
I'd like to give it a chance.

203
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:32,322
Besides, I've been
super bored lately.

204
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:34,365
Sure, whatever, I guess.

205
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,743
Hiro's bad habits have
found a new target.

206
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:38,119
Another way to kill time.

207
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:39,579
Hey, Kurata!

208
00:09:39,621 --> 00:09:41,581
Oh, hello, Kurusu. What's up?

209
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:45,001
The koto club's performance
was so moving the other day.

210
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:46,294
Here.

211
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:48,338
[TAKEZO gasps]
Huh?

212
00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:53,676
[HIRO] So... I was hoping that
you'd let me join the club.

213
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:01,851
[TAKEZO]
And there you have it.

214
00:10:01,893 --> 00:10:04,270
This is our new member,
Hiro Kurusu!

215
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:06,231
She's also a
second‐year student.

216
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:07,774
Nice to meet ya!

217
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:09,859
Whoa! A girl club member?!

218
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:12,403
And she's an older girl.
This is awesome!

219
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:13,738
Show me the ropes, okay?

220
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,532
[MITTSU, KOTA, SANE]
Sure thing, whatever you want!

221
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:17,033
[HIRO gasps, giggles]

222
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:18,493
Your name is Hozuki, right?

223
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:19,327
Yeah.

224
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:21,329
Your performance the
other day was so cool!

225
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:23,665
I heard you're the
daughter of a grand master.

226
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:25,375
That's incredible!

227
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:28,253
Uh, I guess so. [gasps]

228
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,673
Let's introduce ourselves.
My name is Sane.

229
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:32,674
Hi, I'm Kota!

230
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:34,425
And you can call me Mittsu!

231
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:35,927
Well, aren't you guys sweet?

232
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:37,345
[SANE]
And that guy is Chika.

233
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:38,513
Huh? [groans]

234
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:40,640
Don't look so angry,
you're gonna scare her off!

235
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:42,142
[CHIKA]
Knock it off!

236
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:45,645
I think it's amazing that
you guys get along so well.

237
00:10:45,687 --> 00:10:47,147
[TAKEZO]
I haven't had the opportunity

238
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:48,940
to talk to Kurusu much,

239
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:51,526
but it seems like
she'll fit right in.

240
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:54,070
So, now that the
performance is over with,

241
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:55,780
what's our next move?

242
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:58,324
Well, we have qualifiers
in December.

243
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:01,244
But, before that, I thought
it'd be good for us to play

244
00:11:01,286 --> 00:11:03,204
at as many places as possible.

245
00:11:03,246 --> 00:11:05,123
I was thinking we should
sign up for this.

246
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:08,084
[CHIKA] A traditional
Japanese music festival?

247
00:11:08,126 --> 00:11:11,129
Yeah. It's an event
held in August.

248
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:12,422
They pick the best high schools

249
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:14,507
from the seven prefectures
in the Kanto region

250
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:15,800
and then from those seven,

251
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:18,469
they narrow it down to
one grand prize winner.

252
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,597
Does that mean we get to fight
against other high schools

253
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:22,098
using the power of music?

254
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,725
We'll crush those guys!

255
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:26,102
[TAKEZO] Whoa. It seems
everyone's fired up.

256
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:27,020
Well then,

257
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:29,147
all that's left is to pick a
song and start practicing‐‐

258
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:32,066
[SATOWA] Actually,
can I make a suggestion?

259
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:33,776
I think it would be
best if we at least

260
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:36,529
learned a classical piece
before a newer song.

261
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:37,447
Why's that?

262
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:39,282
[SATOWA]
It's hard to explain, but...

263
00:11:39,324 --> 00:11:40,700
...there's a difference
in the sound

264
00:11:40,742 --> 00:11:42,660
between people who've
played classical songs

265
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,078
versus those who haven't.

266
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,122
Their sound has
more depth to it.

267
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:48,583
So what? We've got no depth?

268
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:51,294
It might be more difficult
for the beginners in the club.

269
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:52,921
Kurusu just joined.

270
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:54,464
You don't have to
worry about me.

271
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:56,090
The truth is,
I'm not a beginner.

272
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:56,925
[SANE, TAKEZO, KOTA]
Huh?

273
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:59,677
Wait, are you saying you're
an experienced koto player?

274
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,262
I don't have a
ton of experience,

275
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:03,640
but my grandma
taught me some things.

276
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:05,266
A classical piece
sounds like fun,

277
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:06,309
and if it's simple enough,

278
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:08,978
then I can probably
play it with no problem.

279
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,605
[SANE]
That's awesome!

280
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:13,274
Oh. Well then, I guess
it's all been decided.

281
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:14,609
What song should we pick?

282
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:15,777
Let me think.

283
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:17,195
Maybe "Rokudan"?

284
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:20,073
Wasn't that the piece you played
at the club presentation?

285
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:22,575
[CHIKA] Oh, that weird
song I didn't understand.

286
00:12:22,617 --> 00:12:23,868
[TAKEZO whimpers]

287
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,453
[SATOWA]
"Rokudan no Shirabe."

288
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:27,080
It's a piece that's
representative

289
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:29,499
of the classical works
of the Edo period.

290
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,960
Oh? Guess it looks
simple enough.

291
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:33,836
At least easier
than "Ryuuseigun."

292
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:34,963
It might seem that way,

293
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:37,799
but classical pieces are more
difficult than you might think.

294
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,592
The notations are marked
completely different

295
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:41,094
from most current pieces.

296
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:42,762
It may be too hard for you.

297
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:44,138
What did you just say?

298
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:47,392
Um, I'm sure we'll
all be great. Right?

299
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:50,395
Not to be a downer,
but aren't we short two kotos?

300
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:52,021
[TAKEZO gasps]
You're right.

301
00:12:52,063 --> 00:12:53,147
What should we do?

302
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:54,941
[SANE]
The school won't buy 'em for us?

303
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:58,069
[TAKEZO] It would be a
pretty expensive purchase.

304
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:00,697
It's fine, I can
bring in my own koto.

305
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:01,531
[TAKEZO]
What?

306
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:03,574
You never mentioned
that you had one before.

307
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:05,159
Yeah, Granny gave it to me.

308
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:06,703
[TAKEZO]
She gave you one?!

309
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:08,579
[SANE]
No fair! Why just you?

310
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:11,624
[CHIKA] Thing is, my grandfather
actually made me one

311
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:13,167
before he passed away.

312
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:15,169
So that's why.

313
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:16,546
Seriously?

314
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:18,006
Wow, Kudo.

315

It's weird. You almost

It's pretty obvious she's
still got a wall up.

Huh? You mean earlier?

It makes sense.

When you think about it,

350
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:29,494
the world Hozuki lives in

‐‐[KOTA] Huh?
‐‐Oh, come on.

She's the daughter
of a grand master!

353
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:35,458
And it could just be a rumor,
but I heard she's a prodigy

Ah, well that's cool.

To be honest, we don't really
think about that stuff.

357
00:14:42,757 --> 00:14:44,801
I think Hozuki's just
downplaying her talent

358
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:46,469
because she doesn't
want you to feel bad.

Get this.

360
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:49,430
When she and I were
alone, she said,

00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:50,973
"It's hard sometimes
because I have to

362

You have no business

376
00:15:24,132 --> 00:15:26,342
bringing a koto that
expensive to school, Kudo!

377
00:15:26,384 --> 00:15:28,719
It's worth over one million yen!

I have another koto
that I can bring for us,

waste not to play it, though?

[SATOWA] Then play it at
home or at a performance!

382
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:39,313
What would you do if
someone were to steal it,

Calm down, Hozuki.

385
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:44,569
Chika only brought it in

386
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,112
because he wanted to
help out the club,

387
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:48,614
so it's not very fair
to get angry with him.

388
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:50,450
You have to remember
not everyone has

Maybe his place doesn't
allow loud noises.

Plus, why would
anyone even wanna

steal or damage a koto
in the first place?

00:19:19,367 --> 00:19:21,661
she feels like she
can confide in me.

471
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:24,997
She also said something weird
concerning Chika the other day.

472
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:27,958
Uhh, I think it was about how
she couldn't play with someone

473
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,045
with a different sense of
the koto's worth, maybe?

474
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:32,380
But I doubt it was important.

475
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:35,383
After all, Hozuki lives in
a different world than us.

476
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:39,637
[HIRO gasps]

477
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,973
Well, I don't believe anything
unless I hear it firsthand.

478
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,725
[HIRO gasping]

479
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:48,938
[CHIKA] And what's up with all
this "different world" stuff?

480
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:52,483
We all play the koto in the
same club room every day.

481
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:56,570
Chika! I'm worried that I
might have said something

482
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:58,280
that hurt Hozuki's feelings!

483
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:01,534
What? So go apologize, then.

484
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:03,577
I know Hozuki would
give you a break.

485
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:05,788
She knows you aren't
that kinda guy.

486
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:06,997
Really?

487
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:10,501
[HIRO]
How stupid.

488
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:11,627
[TAKEZO gasps]

489
00:20:14,797 --> 00:20:17,007
Uh‐‐hey, Kurusu?

490
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:19,009
What's up? Is something wrong?

491
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:20,261
[TAKEZO]
Um, no.

492
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:23,305
Wow, I didn't realize everyone
in the club was so buddy‐buddy.

493
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:24,807
I'm a little jealous.

494
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:26,642
Well, let's practice!

495
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:31,897
[HIRO'S GRANDMOTHER]
What brings you by today, Hiro?

496
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:33,816
[HIRO] I came to return
the plectrums I borrowed.

497
00:20:33,858 --> 00:20:35,651
Oh? You don't need them?

498
00:20:35,693 --> 00:20:37,737
I thought you joined
the school's koto club.

499
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:39,613
Yeah, I did, but I'm quitting.

500
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:42,074
It's not even that interesting.

501
00:20:42,116 --> 00:20:44,827
Wasn't even that much
of a time killer.

502
00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:45,995
Now that I think about it,

503
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:48,247
didn't you tell me the daughter
from the Hozuki school

504
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:49,290
was in that club?

505
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:51,959
I heard that she's really going
through a lot at the moment.

506
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:53,210
I feel bad for her.

507
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,044
[HIRO]
Huh?

508
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:54,962
[HIRO'S GRANDMOTHER]
At least's that's what

509
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:56,672
everyone's been saying.

510
00:20:56,714 --> 00:21:00,426
[inaudible]

511
00:21:00,468 --> 00:21:03,053
Seriously? Is that true?

512
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:06,557
Well, I don't believe anything
unless I hear it firsthand.

513
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:08,267
That's so interesting.

514
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:09,727
I wonder if his tune will change

515
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:12,396
once he finds out she's just
a wolf in sheep's clothing.

516
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:13,981
What a little liar.

517
00:21:14,023 --> 00:21:15,775
Huh? Did you say something?

518
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:17,610
[HIRO]
Nope! Actually, can I hold onto

519
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:19,653
those plectrums for a bit?

520
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:22,406
[HIRO] I think it's time
I teach that girl a lesson.

521
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:26,285
Soon she'll realize how
worthless "friends" really are.

522
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:29,330
[CHIKA] I don't see a house that
looks like it could be hers.

523
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:31,665
Am I on the wrong
street or something?

524
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:34,043
Uh, "201 Tsukimotosou"?

525
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:36,253
Wonder if the house is
even around this area.

526
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:39,340
I mean, doesn't Princess
Koto live in a castle?

527
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:43,552
[CHIKA grunts]
Oh, I guess this is it.

528
00:21:43,594 --> 00:21:46,931
Wait. This is where she lives?

529
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:50,726
Okay, now I'm positive
that he must have

530
00:21:50,768 --> 00:21:52,645
given me the wrong address.

531
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,732
[CHIKA]
No nameplate, huh?

532
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:03,030
[doorbell ringing]

533
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:05,699
[CHIKA sighs]

534
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:09,119
Yes. I'm here.

535
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,623
[gasps]

536
00:23:57,061 --> 00:24:00,189
[SATOWA]
Next time, "Unknown Sounds."
