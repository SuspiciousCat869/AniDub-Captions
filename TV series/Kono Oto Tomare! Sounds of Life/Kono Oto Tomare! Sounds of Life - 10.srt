00:14:28,326 --> 00:14:30,495
But now, it's different.

324
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,830
There's no one
beside me anymore.

325
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:35,625
Chika and the others
are too far ahead.

326
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:39,379
They're trying to aim higher,
and I'm holding them back.

327
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:46,511
Wait, what'd you just say?

328
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:48,221
Kota's gone missing?

329
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:51,099
He wasn't in his bed when
I got up to go to the bathroom.

330
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,935
I guess I figured he just
needed to take a leak too.

331
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:56,479
But then when I checked,
he wasn't there.

332
00:14:56,521 --> 00:14:58,189
His stuff is gone.

333
00:14:58,231 --> 00:14:59,232
He won't answer his phone,

334
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:02,276
what if he got fed up
and decided to leave?

335
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:03,486
I'm worried.

336
00:15:03,528 --> 00:15:04,612
He's been kind of down lately

337
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:07,323
because he's been messing
up a lot during practice.

338
00:15:07,365 --> 00:15:08,074
[CHIKA]
Sane.

339
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:09,075
It's my fault.

340
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:11,327
I knew Kota was
struggling with everything.

341
00:15:11,369 --> 00:15:13,704
But... I was so
focused on myself

342
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,415
that I couldn't be bothered
to check in on him.

343
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:17,250
[CHIKA]
Saneyasu!

344
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,252
That's enough.

345
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:21,295
Chika.

346
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:24,841
[CHIKA]
Okay. I'm gonna go look for him.

347
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:26,092
I'll go with you.

348
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:27,510
And me!

349
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:28,469
[TAKEZO]
Kudo!

350
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:30,930
I'll join you after I
wake up Mister Takinami.

351
00:15:30,972 --> 00:15:32,807
Let me know if anything changes.

352
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:34,350
You got it.

353
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:40,022
Why are the boys so noisy?

354
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:44,110
[HIRO]
What? Kota's gone?

355
00:15:44,152 --> 00:15:45,903
You think he got
fed up and left?

356
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,405
[HIRO]
Oh no.

357
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:50,199
Is it because
I was too hard on him?

358
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:51,742
I wanna look for him, too!

359
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,536
Yeah, same here.

360
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:54,537
[TAKEZO]
Kurusu!

361
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:55,329
Uh, hey!

362
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:56,497
Please don't go alone!

363
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:59,542
A few people should stay here
in case he comes back!

364
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:01,252
We'll all meet up later!

365
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,255
[TAKINAMI]
Hey, Kurata!

366
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:05,423
[CHIKA]
That idiot!

367
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:07,508
When I find him, I'll punch him!

368
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:10,219
[SANE] What if he got fed up
and decided to leave?

369
00:16:10,261 --> 00:16:11,471
[CHIKA]
Shit.

370
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:13,598
Well? Anything?

371
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:14,307
[SANE]
You're here!

372
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:15,892
No, not yet.

373
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:18,478
Okay, I'll go down the road
and check around there.

374
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:19,395
Wait, hold on.

375
00:16:19,437 --> 00:16:20,354
Uh.

376
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:21,147
If you go that way,

377
00:16:21,189 --> 00:16:23,274
there's nothing but
a train station, right?

378
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:25,776
[TAKEZO]
Uh. Yeah?

379
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:27,403
What is it?

380
00:16:27,445 --> 00:16:30,406
[SANE]
Takezo. Listen, about Kota.

381
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:33,242
Aw, crap.

382
00:16:33,284 --> 00:16:34,368
Where do I go?

383
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,496
[ticking sounds]

384
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:37,955
[CHIKA]
That sound.

385
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:47,965
Whoa. Chika?

386
00:16:50,468 --> 00:16:52,011
[KOTA]
What's wrong?

387
00:16:54,222 --> 00:16:56,015
[KOTA]
Why are you here?

388
00:16:58,351 --> 00:16:59,560
Ouchie!

389
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:02,855
[CHIKA] Idiot, half the club
is out here looking for you.

390
00:17:02,897 --> 00:17:04,398
What? They are?

391
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,274
Sorry.

392
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:07,735
I didn't think anyone
would notice I was missing.

393
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:08,694
And you weren't
answering your phone,

394
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:11,072
so naturally we all
started panicking.

395
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:12,031
[chuckles]

396
00:17:12,073 --> 00:17:14,408
Come on, I've only
been out here for a little bit.

397
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:15,785
We still panicked.

398
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:16,994
Huh?

399
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:19,455
Sorry.

400
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:25,336
I feel like I'm kind of holding
everybody back right now.

401
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:26,212
What?

402
00:17:26,254 --> 00:17:29,006
I'm the reason we aren't
making progress in practice.

403
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,341
My timing's terrible.

404
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:32,593
All I do is cause
everyone trouble.

405
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:33,177
That's no‐‐

406
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:36,222
I promise. I won't give up!

407
00:17:36,264 --> 00:17:37,723
I'll practice more!

408
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:39,892
I'll work hard to catch up
to everyone else.

409
00:17:39,934 --> 00:17:41,435
I won't give up until I'm there,

410
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:43,896
and once I am,
I'll work even harder!

411
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:45,064
So please...

412
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:48,526
Please don't give up
on me just yet, okay?

413
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:53,030
Because... I wanna be able
to stand beside you all.

414
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:53,864
Ouch!

415
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,784
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, Chika!

416
00:17:56,826 --> 00:18:00,121
It's not fair for you to go off
and practice on your own, dummy.

417
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:00,788
Huh?

418
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:01,956
I'll practice, too.

419
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:04,000
Uh, doesn't that ruin
the point, though?

420
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:05,543
I'm trying to
catch up to you guys.

421
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:06,502
Aw, shuddup!

422
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:09,130
[SANE]
Chika.

423
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:09,880
Bastard.

424
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:12,800
Was a phone call to let us know
you found Kota too much work?

425
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:13,801
Sane.

426
00:18:13,843 --> 00:18:14,510
Mittsu!

427
00:18:14,552 --> 00:18:15,803
[CHIKA]
When did you get here?

428
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:16,762
[TAKEZO]
Sorry.

429
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:18,723
We got here back
when Mizuhara was talking,

430
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:20,808
but we didn't want
to interrupt anything.

431
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,435
[KOTA]
Takezo's here, too?

432
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:24,061
You're such a jerk! Jeez!

433
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,813
Next time answer
your stupid phone!

434
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:27,773
I'm sorry, it was
on silent mode!

435
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:29,650
At least leave us
a note or something.

436
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:30,359
Man!

437
00:18:30,401 --> 00:18:32,486
I'm sorta surprised you guys
knew where to look.

438
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:34,947
Oh, it was because of Adachi.

439
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:37,491
If he went all the way
to the train station,

440
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:38,868
it would mean
he's going home.

441
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:41,329
But that isn't like him.

442
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:44,957
The Kota I know would
never give up like that!

443
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:47,501
And that's why we
decided to come here.

444
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:50,004
[HIRO] I hear voices,
come on, hurry up!

445
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:52,465
[TAKEZO]
Kurusu! Hozuki!

446
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:53,507
[HIRO]
Kota.

447
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:54,133
You're here.

448
00:18:54,175 --> 00:18:56,510
Oh. Uh. Sorry.

449
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:59,513
You and Hozuki
were searching, too?

450
00:19:04,602 --> 00:19:08,064
[HIRO sobs]
Were you out here practicing?

451
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:10,149
[TAKEZO] Kurusu? What's wrong?
Why are you crying?

452
00:19:10,191 --> 00:19:12,735
[KOTA] Please don't cry,
Hiro. I'm sorry!

453
00:19:12,777 --> 00:19:14,528
Sorry. But I thought...

454
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,530
Well, I thought
I had run you off.

455
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:19,950
Since I was so hard on
you during our practice.

456
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:21,619
Sorry, Kota.

457
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:22,745
I am, too.

458
00:19:22,787 --> 00:19:25,081
Because I really shouldn't
have rushed ahead

459
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:26,332
during our practice.

460
00:19:26,374 --> 00:19:27,667
I'm so sorry.

461
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:28,793
Please don't apologize.

462
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:29,752
You're both fine.

463
00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:32,963
I never once thought those
things about either of you.

464
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:35,925
The only person
I was upset with was myself.

465
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:37,134
Still though.

466
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,969
I'd never abandon the club.

467
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:41,347
That's not who I am.

468
00:19:41,389 --> 00:19:42,223
Dummy!

469
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:44,225
This isn't the time
to be acting all cool!

470
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:45,309
Ah. Yeah.

471
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:47,937
[TAKEZO] I thought you two
were gonna wait at the inn.

472
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:51,065
You said not to go out alone,
so we brought an escort.

473
00:19:51,107 --> 00:19:52,441
[CHIKA]
An escort?

474
00:19:52,483 --> 00:19:53,484
Well, well.

475
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:56,153
Must be nice to be
so young and care‐free.

476
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,154
I guess you kids don't care

477
00:19:57,196 --> 00:20:00,449
if you rob adults of their
much‐needed sleep.

478
00:20:00,491 --> 00:20:01,283
Jeez.

479
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:03,953
If you found Mizuhara, why
are you still out in the woods?

480
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:06,580
You'd better hurry up
and get back to the inn.

481
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:08,791
Uh. We're coming.

482
00:20:10,251 --> 00:20:11,502
Thank you, everyone.

483
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:12,545
And I'm sorry.

484
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:13,963
Damn right, jerk!

485
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:16,632
[CHIKA]
Kota.

486
00:20:16,674 --> 00:20:18,467
About what you
were saying earlier.

487
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:19,468
Huh?

488
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:21,429
You said not to give up on you.

489
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,264
I'd hate it if you weren't here.

490
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:24,432
Got it?

491
00:20:43,284 --> 00:20:45,536
G'Morning.

492
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:47,163
Whoa, you guys look terrible!

493
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:48,622
Didn't you sleep at all?

494
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:49,415
[TAKEZO]
No.

495
00:20:49,457 --> 00:20:50,708
After what happened last night,

496
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,793
we figured out what
Mizuhara was struggling with

497
00:20:52,835 --> 00:20:55,171
and tried a few
different things.

498
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:58,007
And it turns out that what he's
having the most problems with

499
00:20:58,048 --> 00:21:00,342
is trying to find
the upbeat in a piece.

500
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:02,887
We haven't figured a
way to overcome it, yet.

501
00:21:03,554 --> 00:21:05,431
[TAKINAMI]
Mizuhara.

502
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:08,058
[KOTA]
Mister Takinami?

503
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,393
Okay?

504
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:12,938
[TAKINAMI]
Try and take the sticky note.

505
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,274
If you can't do it,
you don't get breakfast.

506
00:21:15,316 --> 00:21:17,109
[KOTA]
What?

507
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,404
Focus.

508
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:24,033
Get the sticky note.

509
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:26,577
Got it! Yay, now
I get to eat breakfast.

510
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:27,703
[TAKINAMI]
Mizuhara.

511
00:21:27,745 --> 00:21:30,164
That was the upbeat just now.

512
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:34,835
Next time, try touching
the sticky note five times.

513
00:21:34,877 --> 00:21:37,963
Once you can do that, you can
start changing up the tempo.

514
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:40,674
Sound and rhythm
are things you can't see.

515
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:42,426
So they're hard to understand.

516
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:44,678
All you need to do is burn
the image of what we just did

517
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,013
into your mind.

518
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:48,432
Hammer it into your head.

519
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:50,392
Once the sound and
rhythm are in your body,

520
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:52,394
they're yours to keep.

521
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:54,980
All right then,
you can take over.

522
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:55,898
Here, Kurusu.

523
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:57,441
Uh, Okay!

524
00:21:58,234 --> 00:22:00,736
[KOTA]
Oh. Thanks, Mister Takinami!

525
00:22:00,778 --> 00:22:03,364
[TAKINAMI] You can thank me
when you can actually do it.

526
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:07,493
All right then, Kota.

527
00:22:07,535 --> 00:22:09,078
Are you ready for some training?

528
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:11,038
I don't intend to hold back.

529
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:13,791
[KOTA]
Right!

530
00:23:57,144 --> 00:24:00,147

We Were Searching For."
