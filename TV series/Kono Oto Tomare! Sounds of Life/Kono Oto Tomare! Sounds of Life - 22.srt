1
00:00:24,692 --> 00:00:26,608
[MASHIRO]
I'm sorry, Takezo,

2
00:00:26,692 --> 00:00:29,692
for not being able to get
us a ticket to nationals.

3
00:00:35,608 --> 00:00:37,525
I know my grandson.

4
00:00:40,025 --> 00:00:42,358
[TAKEZO]
It's been a whole year...

5
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:44,733
[CHIKA]
...since that day.

6
00:02:15,942 --> 00:02:17,067
Good morning!

7
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:18,817
Oh, good morning!

8
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,358
[TAKEZO] Wow, breakfast looks
like quite the feast today.

9
00:02:21,442 --> 00:02:23,983
[TAKEZO'S MOM] Well, today's the
national qualifier, isn't it?

10
00:02:24,067 --> 00:02:25,567
You need your energy!

11
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:28,067
Oh, and I'm coming to
hear your performance.

12
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:29,150
What?

13
00:02:29,233 --> 00:02:30,692
[TAKEZO'S MOM]
Do you not want me to?

14
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:32,692
No, it's not like that, but...

15
00:02:32,775 --> 00:02:35,192
Well, I know you've been
working hard every day

16
00:02:35,275 --> 00:02:37,483
from early in the morning
until late at night,

17
00:02:37,567 --> 00:02:41,192
and I haven't heard even a
single one of your performances.

18
00:02:41,275 --> 00:02:43,567
Your dad and I will
come root for you.

19
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:44,983
[TAKEZO]
Dad, too?

20
00:02:45,067 --> 00:02:47,483
[TAKEZO'S MOM] Good thing the
qualifier's on a Sunday!

21
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:50,400
I don't have any plans today,
but I'm not coming.

22
00:02:50,483 --> 00:02:51,900
[TAKEZO'S MOM]
Hey, Takeru!

23
00:02:51,983 --> 00:02:54,733
But if by some chance
you make it to nationals,

24
00:02:54,817 --> 00:02:57,733
then I guess I might
consider going.

25
00:02:57,817 --> 00:03:00,692
[sighs]
That'd be great, thank you.

26
00:03:02,942 --> 00:03:06,650
[TAKEZO]
Hm? Kurusu?

27
00:03:06,733 --> 00:03:09,983
Uh. What's wrong?
Did something happen?

28
00:03:10,067 --> 00:03:12,775
I thought we were all meeting up
by the station near the venue.

29
00:03:12,858 --> 00:03:14,400
[HIRO]
Um. Well...

30
00:03:14,483 --> 00:03:18,817
If you don't mind, do you think
we could go together?

31
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:22,025
I'm so nervous I'm afraid I
might get on the wrong train.

32
00:03:22,108 --> 00:03:25,108
[gasps]
Hold on a sec.

33
00:03:27,192 --> 00:03:29,942
Take this. Hey, your hands!

34
00:03:30,025 --> 00:03:32,567
Jeez, they're like ice!
Were you waiting long?

35
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:35,150
Oh, no, it wasn't
that long, not really!

36
00:03:35,233 --> 00:03:38,900
I mean, your hands are
pretty cold, too, aren't they?

37
00:03:38,983 --> 00:03:41,817
Ah well, to tell
you the truth,

38
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,983
I've been a little
nervous since yesterday.

39
00:03:44,067 --> 00:03:46,317
I'm actually pretty
relieved you're here.

40
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,150
It makes me feel better.

41
00:03:49,317 --> 00:03:51,608
Let's go.

42
00:03:51,692 --> 00:03:55,358
Chika. Do you have everything?
Have you got your plectrums?

43
00:03:55,442 --> 00:03:57,108
Of course I do,
who would forget their

44
00:03:57,192 --> 00:03:59,233
plectrums when they're
going to perform?

45
00:03:59,317 --> 00:04:01,150
[ISAKI] More people
than you might think.

46
00:04:01,233 --> 00:04:03,858
Oh, I'm coming to watch
with Takaoka today.

47
00:04:03,942 --> 00:04:06,025
What? With Tetsuki? How come?

48
00:04:06,108 --> 00:04:08,233
You know, I just heard
he was coming, too,

49
00:04:08,317 --> 00:04:10,233
so I thought I'd be
extra nice and friendly

50
00:04:10,317 --> 00:04:12,775
and give him a ride.
Possibly by force.

51
00:04:12,858 --> 00:04:16,275
Listen, are you trying
to kill him, or what?

52
00:04:16,358 --> 00:04:17,775
See you later.

53
00:04:17,858 --> 00:04:19,025
Chika?

54
00:04:20,317 --> 00:04:23,108
Nationals, snatch that ticket!

55
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:28,733
[CHIKA chuckles] Hey, don't
worry about us. We will!

56
00:04:30,483 --> 00:04:31,983
[chuckles]

57
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:41,900
[MALE JUDGE]
The award goes to...

58
00:04:41,983 --> 00:04:46,275
Kanagawa Prefectural.
Hakuto High School.

59
00:04:54,233 --> 00:04:57,900
[FUMI] Kazusa seems
unusually nervous to me.

60
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:58,942
[NENE giggles]

61
00:04:59,025 --> 00:05:01,025
[KAZUSA gasps]
What's wrong, Nene?

62
00:05:01,108 --> 00:05:04,275
Listen! I just know you're
gonna be number one!

63
00:05:04,358 --> 00:05:05,275
What?

64
00:05:05,358 --> 00:05:07,150
[NENE]
Come on, ask me "why?"!

65
00:05:07,233 --> 00:05:08,942
Okay, then, why?

66
00:05:09,025 --> 00:05:11,525
You'll win 'cause
I'm rooting for you!

67
00:05:11,608 --> 00:05:13,858
[gasps]

68
00:05:13,942 --> 00:05:16,775
You're such an angel!
Thank you, Nene!

69
00:05:18,692 --> 00:05:21,692
You're right. There's no
way I'm gonna lose.

70
00:05:21,775 --> 00:05:23,192
I'm going to take
you to nationals

71
00:05:23,275 --> 00:05:25,108
if it's the last thing I do!

72
00:05:25,192 --> 00:05:26,567
[FUMI]
Don't worry, Kazusa.

73
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:30,900
Himesaka is never going to
lose again. I'm sure of it.

74
00:05:32,942 --> 00:05:37,525
[UTA] Jeez, Mio! Hurry up,
the bus is already at school!

75
00:05:37,608 --> 00:05:38,483
[MIO]
I can't.

76
00:05:38,567 --> 00:05:39,858
What?

77
00:05:39,942 --> 00:05:43,650
I don't have enough... power.
I need to charge it.

78
00:05:43,733 --> 00:05:45,233
[UTA]
Mio!

79
00:05:45,317 --> 00:05:48,650
Hey! Suzumori! Looks to me
like you found Kanzaki, huh?

80
00:05:48,733 --> 00:05:50,150
I'm glad you did!

81
00:05:50,233 --> 00:05:53,317
I suppose so! But Mio was saying
he still isn't coming yet.

82
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,608
[YAMAMOTO]
Aw, and why's that?

83
00:05:55,692 --> 00:05:57,358
Photosynthesis.

84
00:05:57,442 --> 00:06:01,442
Oh, I see! Photosynthesis!
Do you mind if I join?

85
00:06:02,567 --> 00:06:06,858
[YAMAMOTO] Hm. Wow, this feels
good, doesn't it, Kanzaki?

86
00:06:06,942 --> 00:06:10,150
You look... like you're
having fun again.

87
00:06:10,233 --> 00:06:12,025
Yep! I sure am!

88
00:06:12,108 --> 00:06:14,983
Because the national
qualifier is finally here!

89
00:06:15,067 --> 00:06:16,317
I've been waiting so long,

90
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,858
I almost can't believe
today is the day!

91
00:06:19,942 --> 00:06:21,358
I see.

92
00:06:21,442 --> 00:06:23,608
[YAMAMOTO laughs]
I couldn't go

93
00:06:23,692 --> 00:06:26,608
to the traditional music
festival because I got the flu.

94
00:06:26,692 --> 00:06:27,817
[MIO]
Oh yeah?

95
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,775
[YAMAMOTO]
You don't remember?

96
00:06:29,858 --> 00:06:36,608
Seriously. Thank you for
following me all this way.

97
00:06:36,692 --> 00:06:40,192
[MIO] You're welcome, but I
didn't really follow you, so...

98
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:42,775
[YAMAMOTO] What?!
Oh, right, yeah, of course!

99
00:06:42,858 --> 00:06:44,442
That sounded stupid, didn't it?

100
00:06:44,525 --> 00:06:46,442
Wow, I feel pretty
embarrassed now.

101
00:06:46,525 --> 00:06:47,650
Forget I said it!

102
00:06:47,733 --> 00:06:49,983
[UTA] Hey, come on,
you guys, we'll be late!

103
00:06:50,067 --> 00:06:55,233
Oh. Sorry, Suzumori! Time to
get up, Kanzaki. Let's go!

104
00:06:58,525 --> 00:07:02,442
Hey, listen, Mio.
About Mister Yamamoto.

105
00:07:03,442 --> 00:07:05,025
[YAMAMOTO]
Kanzaki!

106
00:07:05,108 --> 00:07:06,358
If you don't hurry it up,

107
00:07:06,442 --> 00:07:09,108
I'm gonna be forced to
come carry you to the bus!

108
00:07:11,525 --> 00:07:14,233
[MIO] That's fine.
Carry me on your back.

109
00:07:14,317 --> 00:07:15,567
[YAMAMOTO]
Huh?

110
00:07:17,817 --> 00:07:21,442
Okay, guys, take deep breaths.
I heard exhaling is important.

111
00:07:21,525 --> 00:07:27,400
[ALL inhale, exhales]

112
00:07:27,483 --> 00:07:28,858
It's not working!

113
00:07:28,942 --> 00:07:30,692
I swear, my heart is about
to pop right out of my ear!

114
00:07:30,775 --> 00:07:31,900
[KOTA]
Quick! Plug it up!

115
00:07:31,983 --> 00:07:33,775
[MITTSU] Calm down!
We'll try acupressure!

116
00:07:33,858 --> 00:07:36,317
My mom said pressing here on
our hands relieves tension.

117
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,983
[KOTA] I read on the internet
that it helps if we

118
00:07:38,067 --> 00:07:40,025
admit we're nervous!

119
00:07:40,108 --> 00:07:41,108

Okay, we're doing both!

We're so nervous!
We're so nervous!

you guys doing?

Hozuki! Don't scare
us like that!

00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:51,900
Why are you already
so nervous, anyway?

126
00:07:51,983 --> 00:07:54,442
It's not like this is
our first competition.

127
00:07:54,525 --> 00:07:55,567
No, you're exactly right!

128
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:57,525
And that's why we're
even more nervous!

129
00:07:57,608 --> 00:08:02,025
And on top of that, today,
you know, um... It's just...

00:08:02,108 --> 00:08:04,733
We can't fail today, for sure.

that, you'll definitely mess up.

[ALL yell]

Shouldn't you maybe say
something inspiring or hopeful?

It's shock therapy.

today's competition, but she
didn't write back or call me.

But... It's okay.

My personal performance and
my performance with you.

Yeah. Let's go.

[SANE, MITTSU gasp]

157
00:09:11,483 --> 00:09:12,942
What? What is it?

158
00:09:13,025 --> 00:09:14,900
[SATOWA gasps]
Actually, it's nothing.

159
00:09:14,983 --> 00:09:16,817
I'm so sorry. Never min--

160
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,817
Okay, will you stop
being so hesitant?

161
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:19,692
Hey!

162
00:09:19,775 --> 00:09:20,775
[CHIKA]
Can I open it? Cool.

163
00:09:20,858 --> 00:09:22,025
[SATOWA]
Wait!

164
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,150
[TAKEZO]
Are they charms?

165
00:09:29,233 --> 00:09:30,733
They're in the
shape of a bridge!

166
00:09:30,817 --> 00:09:32,483
And they have our names on them!

167
00:09:32,567 --> 00:09:35,233
Did you make these
all by yourself, Hozuki?

168
00:09:35,317 --> 00:09:38,442
Um. Yeah, but I'm sorry that
they aren't very well made,

169
00:09:38,525 --> 00:09:40,483
and they're tacky.

170
00:09:40,567 --> 00:09:44,108
I-I caused you trouble
because of my family stuff.

171
00:09:44,192 --> 00:09:46,442
So I made these for us
in hopes that we'll

172
00:09:46,525 --> 00:09:48,025
still do our best today.

173
00:09:48,108 --> 00:09:50,483
[HIRO]
Hozuki. They're great!

174
00:09:50,567 --> 00:09:52,233
Thank you so much
for making them!

175
00:09:52,317 --> 00:09:54,775
They're filled with love,
and that makes them precious!

176
00:09:54,858 --> 00:09:57,275
We'll definitely be all
right now, thanks to these!

177
00:09:57,358 --> 00:09:58,858
Thank you!

178

[KOTA]
Here, Mister Takinami!

179
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,317
[TAKINAMI]
What? I've got one, too? Thanks.

180
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:06,483
[TAKEZO] Hozuki. Did you poke
your fingers with the needle?

181
00:10:06,567 --> 00:10:08,067
[SATOWA]
I did, but my fingertips

182
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,942
are really hard now, so...

183
00:10:10,025 --> 00:10:13,442
[SANE] Uh, Chika? We need to
get going or we'll be late.

184
00:10:13,525 --> 00:10:16,317
Hey, what's the deal with him?
He didn't even say "thank you."

185
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,275
[TAKINAMI] Kudo, that's the
wrong direction.

186
00:10:19,358 --> 00:10:21,817
Oh, wow. He must
be really happy.

187
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:24,108
Yeah, looks like it.

188
00:10:24,192 --> 00:10:28,067
Maybe this is the first time
anyone's given him a charm.

189
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:31,608
[CHIKA] This is crazy.
I mean, it's just a charm.

190
00:10:31,692 --> 00:10:34,192
Do me a favor and never
show your face here again.

191
00:10:34,275 --> 00:10:35,442
[MALE DELINQUENT]
Probably best to just use him

192
00:10:35,525 --> 00:10:37,275
when we need to win a fight.

193
00:10:39,192 --> 00:10:40,275
[gasps]

194
00:10:40,358 --> 00:10:42,608
I guess we should
get going, too.

195
00:10:42,692 --> 00:10:44,192
[CHIKA]
Hey, Granddad.

196
00:10:44,275 --> 00:10:48,525
The koto club you created really
is amazing! You'd be proud!

197
00:10:48,608 --> 00:10:51,567
I wish these days
could go on forever.

198

[TSUKAJI]
Komaki! Hurry up!

199
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:57,025
We're gonna head out
to the venue now!

200
00:10:57,108 --> 00:11:00,233
[KOMAKI] Mister Tsukaji!
Please, wait for me!

201
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,983
[KOMAKI]
I don't understand, sir.

202
00:11:04,067 --> 00:11:07,192
Is there some particular reason
I have to come today, too?

203
00:11:07,275 --> 00:11:08,692
Whenever I go to concerts,

204
00:11:08,775 --> 00:11:11,233
I always fall asleep right in
the middle, without fail.

205
00:11:11,317 --> 00:11:12,858
So I really think
it might be better

206
00:11:12,942 --> 00:11:14,608
if you just watch it alone.

207
00:11:14,692 --> 00:11:18,567
[TSUKAJI] Komaki! Can you
please take your job seriously?

208
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:21,025
We publish a magazine
on traditional music!

209
00:11:21,108 --> 00:11:23,858
You're one of the editors,
for god's sake. Act like it!

210
00:11:23,942 --> 00:11:26,942
[chuckles] I was hired
through personal connections.

211
00:11:27,025 --> 00:11:29,483
Traditional Japanese music
just isn't my thing!

212
00:11:29,567 --> 00:11:31,108
That's enough!

213
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:35,150
Okay, tell me something,
honestly,

214
00:11:35,233 --> 00:11:37,733
don't you think koto is
kind of a tough subject?

215
00:11:37,817 --> 00:11:38,942
If that's how you feel,

216
00:11:39,025 --> 00:11:41,192
then today's work will
suit you very well.

217
00:11:41,275 --> 00:11:42,983
Huh?

218
00:11:43,067 --> 00:11:45,858
[TSUKAJI] It's Kanagawa's
qualifier for nationals.

219
00:11:45,942 --> 00:11:49,150
You think the koto is tough?
Difficult to approach?

220
00:11:49,233 --> 00:11:51,900
This is way beyond that.
Today a bunch of

221
00:11:51,983 --> 00:11:54,983
high school students in
their prime battle it out.

222
00:11:59,983 --> 00:12:04,400
[MITTSU gasps] So, all of
them are our rivals, huh?

223
00:12:04,483 --> 00:12:06,900
Tons of girls, as expected.

224
00:12:06,983 --> 00:12:09,275
A total of 14 schools, was it?

225
00:12:09,358 --> 00:12:11,775
Right. And the number
that goes to nationals...

226
00:12:11,858 --> 00:12:13,108
...is just one.

227
00:12:13,192 --> 00:12:14,358
Yeah.

It's me! Remember?

232
00:12:25,817 --> 00:12:28,775
I made friends with you guys
during the music festival.

233
00:12:28,858 --> 00:12:32,442
Yeah, I don't remember us
becoming buddies! Although...

He was the one.

235
00:12:34,775 --> 00:12:37,192
You told me that my tones were
unrefined that one time!

236
00:12:37,275 --> 00:12:40,567
I found out later that you were
saying I sucked, you bastard!

Don't agree with me!

we're not the same as
we were back then!

seem to disappear on me

244
00:12:50,817 --> 00:12:52,400
when I look away for a second!

245
00:12:52,483 --> 00:12:54,650
Everyone's looking
for you over--

246

Whoa! It's Tokise High School!

247

Yeah, that's us, what about it?

248
00:12:58,858 --> 00:13:00,858
Er. Forgive me! Sorry!

249

Are you their
advisor or something?

250

I'm Taishin Yamamoto. I'm the
advisor for Hakuto's koto club.

251
00:13:07,525 --> 00:13:09,483
I'm delighted to meet you!

252
00:13:09,567 --> 00:13:13,608
Well, thanks a lot.
I'm Takinami, Tokise's advisor.

253
00:13:13,692 --> 00:13:16,233
Man, oh, man. I heard your
school's performance.

254
00:13:16,317 --> 00:13:18,192
The festival put out a DVD.

255
00:13:18,275 --> 00:13:20,567
I can't even tell you
how moved I was!

256
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:23,442
So, what kind of guidance
do you give them?

257
00:13:23,525 --> 00:13:25,942
[TAKINAMI] Nothing really.
It's all my students' doing.

258
00:13:26,025 --> 00:13:28,733
[YAMAMOTO]
Wow! What a cool answer!

259
00:13:28,817 --> 00:13:30,067
Unlike the music festival,

260
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:33,317
Tokise performs right after
Hakuto today, right?

261
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,983
I'll be rushing to
hear your performance

262
00:13:35,067 --> 00:13:36,858
as soon as ours is over!

263
00:13:36,942 --> 00:13:38,358
Okay...

264
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:40,858
What? We're playing
right after Hakuto?

265
00:13:40,942 --> 00:13:42,275
Yeah.

266
00:13:42,358 --> 00:13:44,400
[CHIKA] Huh? For real?
How come we didn't know that?

267

you tell us that, Suzu?

the second to last performance,

not who we
were following!

270
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:53,400
What? Did you need to know?

271
00:13:53,483 --> 00:13:56,442
Does the order affect your
performance somehow?

272
00:13:56,525 --> 00:14:00,483
You scared? Oh. I guess
maybe you are, huh?

273
00:14:00,567 --> 00:14:03,900
No, we're not scared!

what wonderful leadership!

I gotta say, my students give a
very good performance, too.

00:16:13,108 --> 00:16:14,775
Is there anything
I can help with?

311
00:16:14,858 --> 00:16:18,692
[KAZUSA] Ah, no, I'm okay.
Thank you, though.

312
00:16:18,775 --> 00:16:21,358
It's just that I'm kinda
more nervous than usual.

313
00:16:21,442 --> 00:16:24,067
Since we're playing early,
the third in line.

314
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:28,150
I see. But that's natural.
Just know that when you perform,

315
00:16:28,233 --> 00:16:30,275
all of us support members
are rooting for you!

316

[whimpers]

319
00:16:41,733 --> 00:16:44,650
Well, if you need anything,
just let me know.

320
00:16:44,733 --> 00:16:46,775
[KAZUSA]
Hozumi!

321
00:16:46,858 --> 00:16:51,150
We'll get there. We'll play
together at nationals!

322
00:16:51,233 --> 00:16:53,233
[chuckles]
Yeah, of course!

323
00:16:57,358 --> 00:16:58,525
[KAZUSA gasps]

324
00:17:01,233 --> 00:17:04,025
Whoa, it's been a while since
we were in a hall like this!

325
00:17:04,108 --> 00:17:06,442
This one's smaller than
the music festival, though.

326
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:09,358
Well, only about half the number
of schools are performing.

327
00:17:09,442 --> 00:17:10,733
[buzzer]

328
00:17:10,817 --> 00:17:12,692
[CHIKA]
It's starting.

329
00:17:14,567 --> 00:17:16,025
[FEMALE STUDENT A]
We are now commencing...

330
00:17:16,108 --> 00:17:18,775
...the Kanagawa Qualifier.

331
00:17:18,858 --> 00:17:24,775
The thirty-second annual Japan
High School Music Competition.

332
00:17:24,858 --> 00:17:28,525
Oh, wow! They're all high school
students down there! So young!

333
00:17:28,608 --> 00:17:29,900
But just as I thought,

334
00:17:29,983 --> 00:17:33,275
it seems there are very few
boys competing. Bummer.

335
00:17:33,358 --> 00:17:36,358
And only one school can
make it to nationals, right?

336
00:17:36,442 --> 00:17:39,275
I wonder which school
I wanna root for.

337
00:17:39,358 --> 00:17:42,025
What do you think,
which school is going to win?

338
00:17:42,108 --> 00:17:43,692
You're oversimplifying it.

339
00:17:43,775 --> 00:17:45,858
I really would prefer to think
that the one who worked

340
00:17:45,942 --> 00:17:48,275
the hardest will win,
but who knows?

341
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:51,067
Because even if they worked
as hard as they can,

342
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:53,442
the pressure of performing
in a competition like this

343
00:17:53,525 --> 00:17:56,150
will cause some of them
to make mistakes.

344
00:17:56,233 --> 00:17:59,400
Chemistry with the judges is
a significant factor, too.

345
00:17:59,483 --> 00:18:00,900
[KOMAKI]
Really?

346
00:18:00,983 --> 00:18:03,317
[TSUKAJI] It can't be helped.
The judges are only human.

347
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:06,025
Let's see, today's judges are...

348
00:18:06,108 --> 00:18:08,067
[TSUKAJI]
One of them is pretty strict.

349
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:10,483
Well. As usual,
it's reasonable to think

350
00:18:10,567 --> 00:18:13,400
that Himesaka will
take first place.

351
00:18:13,483 --> 00:18:17,275
But I couldn't go to the Kanto
Japanese Music Festival.

352
00:18:17,358 --> 00:18:18,608
I'm curious about Hakuto,

353
00:18:18,692 --> 00:18:21,358
seeing as they beat out
Himesaka for first there.

354
00:18:21,442 --> 00:18:23,733
I would have watched the DVD,

355
00:18:23,817 --> 00:18:27,192
But somebody spilled coffee on
it before I had the chance!

356
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:32,067
[AKIRA] That lesson took longer
than I thought it would.

357
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:34,025
I'll have to hurry to the venue.

358
00:18:38,775 --> 00:18:40,775
[AKIRA]
Guess she's still angry with me.

359
00:18:40,858 --> 00:18:42,692
Not a huge surprise,
but still...

360
00:18:42,775 --> 00:18:43,817
[gasps]

361
00:18:50,067 --> 00:18:53,775
[AKIRA]
Excuse me. Grand Master?

362
00:18:53,858 --> 00:18:54,942
What is it?

363
00:18:55,025 --> 00:18:56,775
Oh, well. I'm getting
ready to head out

364
00:18:56,858 --> 00:18:58,692
to the National Qualifier.

365
00:18:58,775 --> 00:19:02,775
I know that I've already told
you, but Satowa's performing.

366
00:19:02,858 --> 00:19:05,317
I'm driving myself there.
I could give you a ride--

367
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:09,150
I said I that can't go.
Satowa's been excommunicated.

368
00:19:09,233 --> 00:19:10,900
As the grand master
of this school,

369
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:13,317
it would be improper to
watch her performance.

370
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,108
But it's not improper.

371
00:19:15,192 --> 00:19:18,900
You're more than just a teacher,
you're also her mother.

372
00:19:18,983 --> 00:19:20,317
[CHIHARU]
After everything I've done,

373
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,817
I'm not even sure I
can claim that much.

374
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,900
I had my own problems
to deal with,

375
00:19:24,983 --> 00:19:27,525
so I turned my eyes
away from her feelings.

376
00:19:27,608 --> 00:19:29,733
And when she was screaming
for help on that stage,

377
00:19:29,817 --> 00:19:33,150
I responded to her with
nothing but contempt.

378
00:19:33,233 --> 00:19:35,358
I don't have the right
to call myself her mother,

379
00:19:35,442 --> 00:19:36,983
let alone hear her perform.

380
00:19:37,067 --> 00:19:40,733
Okay. That's it!

381
00:19:40,817 --> 00:19:43,650
Hey. Let go! What do
you think you're doing?

382
00:19:43,733 --> 00:19:44,983
I don't have to time
to argue with you,

383
00:19:45,067 --> 00:19:46,858
so I'm sorry, but you're going!

384
00:19:46,942 --> 00:19:48,358
[CHIHARU gasps]

385
00:19:48,442 --> 00:19:51,233
I know this is none of my
business and I'm being selfish,

386
00:19:51,317 --> 00:19:53,567
But too bad! Enough is enough!

387
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,608
I refuse to let the
shackles of this school

388
00:19:55,692 --> 00:19:58,317
and the hardships of the
past bind everybody!

389
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,192
Not anymore, I'm so tired of it!

390
00:20:01,275 --> 00:20:04,650
What is all the commotion?
My goodness, Akira.

391
00:20:04,733 --> 00:20:05,983
What sort of stunt
are you pulling--

392
00:20:06,067 --> 00:20:08,608
Perfect timing.
I'll take you with us, too.

393
00:20:08,692 --> 00:20:09,983

You heard me, come on.
You need to hear them play!

down, you're being too rough!

Sorry, but I'm not sure
what you're trying to say.

399
00:20:29,067 --> 00:20:31,192
To be honest, I don't understand
the name of the piece

400
00:20:31,275 --> 00:20:32,650
that Hakuto's playing.

401
00:20:32,733 --> 00:20:35,483
[TAKEZO]
What does that say? "Katagashi"?

402
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:38,192
"Katakago".
It's a type of flower.

403
00:20:38,275 --> 00:20:39,983
An archaic word for katakuri.

404
00:20:40,067 --> 00:20:41,358
That's stupid.

405
00:20:41,442 --> 00:20:43,233
I don't know why they picked
such a difficult name.

406
00:20:43,317 --> 00:20:45,650
Do you think it's
another original piece?

407
00:20:45,733 --> 00:20:48,650
Most likely. It has the same
composer as last time.

408
00:20:48,733 --> 00:20:49,900
[CHIKA, TAKEZO gasp]

409
00:20:49,983 --> 00:20:53,942
It does? Looks like the
composer is Miyabi Tojo.

410
00:20:54,025 --> 00:20:55,650
Have you heard of this person?

411
00:20:55,733 --> 00:20:57,067
Well, no.

412
00:20:57,150 --> 00:20:59,983
I checked around, but I
couldn't find any info on them.

413
00:21:00,067 --> 00:21:02,317
[TAKINAMI] It would appear that
Hakuto has a very talented

414
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,525
composer in their club.

415
00:21:04,608 --> 00:21:07,150
Are you doing okay?
You're awfully quiet.

416
00:21:07,233 --> 00:21:08,900
It's about Himesaka.

00:21:08,983 --> 00:21:10,108
What about them?

418
00:21:10,192 --> 00:21:11,650
Well, I thought for
sure they would

419
00:21:11,733 --> 00:21:14,358
play another difficult piece.

We worked exceptionally hard
to get to these qualifiers.

I know we've had our fair
share of disagreements.

in the best of moods.
