Yes, Wakaba.

[WAKABA]
To be honest, I don't believe

that we're inferior to Hakuto.

18

I think their piece turned out
to be more popular

Yeah.

kind of feel like a fluke.

Yae?

It wasn't some
freak accident that we lost.

We let our reputation
get to our heads.

there's no way we'll lose,"

Mm-hmm. I think so as well.

But we retire after
next week's Tokyo performance.

And so, we must
leave it in your hands.

Yes!

[KAZUSA] I didn't even hear
Hakuto's performance.

Right after Tokise
finished playing,

I went to see that guy
to complain about him.

In one fell swoop,

42
00:03:29,733 --> 00:03:32,733
I looked down on both
Tokise and Hakuto.

That's a lot of string-pressing!

Then, I'd like to
make a suggestion.

All these years, every member
has played in the qualifier.

But you can't win
like that anymore.

The era of Himesaka always
being number one is over.

75
00:04:53,983 --> 00:04:56,942
So we should approach this the
way we usually do for nationals

76
00:04:57,025 --> 00:04:59,567

it's gonna be tough to perform,

She's not even a big deal.

like she's something special.

harsher than intended.

315
00:15:54,358 --> 00:15:56,067
You shouldn't casually
praise our rival!

316
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:57,733
Do that and we're gonna lose!

317
00:15:57,817 --> 00:16:00,067
Shut up! What's good is good!

318
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:02,942
But it's okay because our
performance will be better!

319
00:16:03,025 --> 00:16:04,317
[TAKINAMI laughs]

320
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,733
[CHIKA]
Hey, Takinami.

321
00:16:05,817 --> 00:16:06,983
What're you laughin' about?

322
00:16:07,067 --> 00:16:08,108
[TAKINAMI]
Oh, nothing.

323
00:16:08,192 --> 00:16:09,858
I just like this
side of you, is all.

324
00:16:09,942 --> 00:16:11,108
[CHIKA]
Heh.

325
00:16:12,942 --> 00:16:15,858
[YAMAMOTO]
Ah! It's Mr. Takinami!

326
00:16:15,942 --> 00:16:17,567
You. From Hakuto.

327
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:19,358
I'm Taishin Yamamoto!

328
00:16:19,442 --> 00:16:20,775
So, Mr. Yamamoto.

329
00:16:20,858 --> 00:16:22,775
Are you guys on your way
to the tuning room now?

330
00:16:22,858 --> 00:16:24,108
Uh-huh!

331
00:16:24,192 --> 00:16:26,150
I'm already so nervous
that my heart's pounding!

332
00:16:26,233 --> 00:16:27,483
By the way,

333
00:16:27,567 --> 00:16:29,567
you're not just their advisor,
you also instruct

334
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:31,567
the Hakuto students, right?

335
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:33,567
Uh. Yeah. More or less.

336
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:35,733
[TAKINAMI] Is it safe to assume
you're a music teacher?

337
00:16:35,817 --> 00:16:37,358
Oh, no. That's flattering,

338
00:16:37,442 --> 00:16:39,192
but I'm normally
just a math teacher.

339
00:16:39,275 --> 00:16:41,108
Though I really love music, too!

340
00:16:41,192 --> 00:16:43,525
Wow. That's something.

341
00:16:43,608 --> 00:16:45,608
I'm surprised. You give
great instruction

342
00:16:45,692 --> 00:16:47,483
despite your lack
of a background.

343
00:16:47,567 --> 00:16:48,567
Huh?

344
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:50,400
I saw the DVD
of the music festival.

345
00:16:50,483 --> 00:16:52,692
I was impressed by
Hakuto's performance.

346
00:16:52,775 --> 00:16:55,525
It was so high level,
it kinda blew me away.

347
00:16:55,608 --> 00:16:58,733
The piece, and how it was
played, was perfectly calculated

348
00:16:58,817 --> 00:17:01,400
so the music would resonate
with the listeners' hearts.

349
00:17:01,483 --> 00:17:03,525
Oh. And while
we're on the topic,

350
00:17:03,608 --> 00:17:07,067
who's Miyabi Tojo, the one
who composes your pieces?

351
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:08,983
They create such
fantastic songs,

352
00:17:09,067 --> 00:17:11,108
and yet no matter
how hard I searched-- Uh?

353
00:17:11,192 --> 00:17:14,900
[YAMAMOTO groaning]

354
00:17:14,983 --> 00:17:17,775
Uh. I'm gonna guess
I shouldn't have said that.

355
00:17:17,858 --> 00:17:19,567
Oh! No, you're fine!

356
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:20,983
It's not that at all!

357
00:17:21,067 --> 00:17:23,317
I-- Well, no one's ever
said that to me before, so...

358
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,942
Y'know! It made me so happy,
I didn't know what to do!

359
00:17:26,025 --> 00:17:28,150
That's all.

360
00:17:28,233 --> 00:17:29,233
Uh...

361
00:17:29,317 --> 00:17:30,608
Um, excuse me!

362
00:17:30,692 --> 00:17:32,567
We have to hurry up or
we're gonna run out of time!

363
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:33,692
[YAMAMOTO]
Oh, sorry!

364
00:17:33,775 --> 00:17:35,275
[ARAGAKI]
Let's go!

365
00:17:35,358 --> 00:17:37,317
Gotta run, Mr. Takinami!

366
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,817
If you don't mind, I'd love
to talk sometime soon!

367
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:43,858
Sure thing. See ya then.

368
00:17:43,942 --> 00:17:46,275
Huh. A math teacher, huh?

369
00:17:46,358 --> 00:17:49,317
That explains some things.

370
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,567
No wonder I couldn't find him.

371
00:17:53,442 --> 00:17:55,942
[TAKINAMI]
Kurata. It's time for us to head

372
00:17:56,025 --> 00:17:57,233
to the tuning room.

373

Hey, it's Chika and the others.

377
00:18:04,858 --> 00:18:06,858
I wonder if they're
getting ready now.

378
00:18:06,942 --> 00:18:09,275
--Wanna talk to them?
--Nah, I think I'll pass.

379
00:18:09,358 --> 00:18:12,650
I wouldn't want to accidentally
disturb their concentration.

380
00:18:12,733 --> 00:18:15,525
Sorry, but is that
seat next to you taken?

381

No. Go ahead.

"The Heavens Cry"...?

00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:30,442
I wonder what
this piece is like.

would be nervous.

I can't take much more
of this--I'm at my limit.

Yes, Himesaka's
performance was great,

433

I'll give you that, but all
the schools after them

just kinda sound
alike to my ear.

I can't necessarily say

that she's wrong.

439

So far, Himesaka is clearly
the top contender,

440
00:20:31,275 --> 00:20:33,733
and there's little
difference among the rest.

Will Himesaka
continue their streak

and go to nationals
again this year?

00:21:44,442 --> 00:21:46,442
I've never seen him
smile like that before.

473
00:21:47,567 --> 00:21:48,900
What? The Advisor?

474
00:21:48,983 --> 00:21:51,025

And today is the last day.

477
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:02,317

music festival...

480
00:22:07,775 --> 00:22:09,900
...was the real deal.

481
00:23:51,608 --> 00:23:54,483
[CHIKA] Next time:
