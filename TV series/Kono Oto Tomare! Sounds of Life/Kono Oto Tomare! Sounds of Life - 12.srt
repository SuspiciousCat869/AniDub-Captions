1
00:01:47,983 --> 00:01:50,777
[applause]

2
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:54,239
[SATOWA]
So, this... is a Meiryo concert.

3
00:01:56,742 --> 00:01:59,411
Somehow it's like,
I saw all the seasons.

4
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:00,579
Yeah, same.

5
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:02,664
It feels like a
year just passed.

6
00:02:02,706 --> 00:02:05,584
[KAZUSA] I can't believe someone
like him is this skilled.

7
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:07,294
Disgusting.

8
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:10,672
Good work, everyone!

9
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:12,758
You were amazing out there!

10
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,970
Hey, Ousuke,
are you feeling okay?

11
00:02:17,012 --> 00:02:18,639
Huh? Yeah, why?

12
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,389
It's just...

13
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:21,266
You used to get
so sick after performing,

14
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:23,477
and I was wondering if
it was happening again.

15
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:26,688
Nah. I'm not as
weak as I was back then.

16
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:29,274
I mean, if you gave me a kiss,

17
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:32,486
maybe I'd feel
a little better, Asa.

18
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:33,695
Will you shut up?

19
00:02:33,737 --> 00:02:36,156
[OUSUKE chuckles]
I'm just kidding.

20
00:02:38,033 --> 00:02:40,118
[YOSHIKI]
Asano! Ousuke! Nice work!

21
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,912
That was a great performance!

22
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:43,413
[ASANO]
Yoshi!

23
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:54,716
[JUDGE A] About what
I expected from Meiryo.

24
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:57,719
It's obvious why they got
second place at nationals.

25
00:02:57,761 --> 00:02:59,930
I'm surprised someone beat them.

26
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:01,598
Are we sure it was
smart to let them perform

27
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,266
before every other school?

28
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:04,142
The rest of the students

29
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:07,020
are going to have a
hard time following that up.

30
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:11,608
Why do you guys
look so depressed?

31
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:12,567
How could we not be

32
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:14,486
after watching a
performance like that?

33
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:17,364
It's just hitting me that we may
never be able to defeat them.

34
00:03:17,406 --> 00:03:20,492
Chika, do you honestly think we
have a chance of surpassing them

35
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:22,327
with our performance?

36
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:26,206
What nonsense are
you guys on about?

37
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:29,084
Comparing yourselves
to them is ridiculous.

38
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:30,585
[CHIKA]
What did you just say?

39
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:32,671
Think about it. Imagine if Kudo,

40
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:35,090
on his first day learning
the koto, heard me play

41
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:37,134
and thought
"I can't beat that."

42
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:39,094
It's nothing short of laughable.

43
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,721
Well, when you
put it that way,

44
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:42,556
it does sound kinda ridiculous.

45
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:43,598
Come on!

46
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,935
You know, to reach the goal
we hung on the clubroom wall,

47
00:03:46,977 --> 00:03:50,355
we have no choice but
to surpass their performance.

48
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:51,481
If seeing how good they are

49
00:03:51,523 --> 00:03:55,110
with your own two eyes makes you
think that goal is impossible,

50
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:56,862
then what?

51
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,864
Would you rather quit?

52
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,369
[SANE]
Chika?

53
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:05,704
Are you kidding me?

54
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:07,372
What do you mean,
"would you rather quit?"

55
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:09,166
I oughtta kick
your ass for that, Specs!

56
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:12,043
Any guy who quits before
he even starts has no balls!

57
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:15,088
Can you not say "balls"?
And what's with the head trauma?

58
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,215
[CHIKA]
It's self‐punishment!

59
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:23,388
Consider this an apology
for getting discouraged!

60
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,347
Sane, punch me too!

61
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:25,348
I wanna say sorry!

62
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,934
Yeah, me three,
but gently please?

63
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,312
[chuckles]

64
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:32,230
It looks like somebody's
gotten better at dealing

65
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,607
with everyone, haven't they?

66
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:35,192
Oh, yeah? Think so?

67
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:35,942
[CHIKA]
All right!

68
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:39,196
If you really want it,
I'll hit you all right now!

69
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:40,989
[SATOWA]
They bounce back quickly.

70
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:43,283
[HIRO]
Oh, by the way, where's Suzu?

71
00:04:43,325 --> 00:04:44,826
[TAKEZO] He said
the hall was suffocating,

72
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:47,287
so he's at the café upstairs.

73
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:49,956
[HIRO] Jeez,
why'd he even bother coming?

74
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:51,792
[TAKEZO] I expected
a little more from him

75
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:54,377
after he helped Mizuhara
out the other day.

76
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:55,086
Hey, guys.

77
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,714
Are there any other powerhouses
like Meiryo and Himesaka

78
00:04:57,756 --> 00:05:00,217
within Kanagawa?

79
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:02,761
[TAKEZO] Himesaka is always
at the very top in Kanagawa

80
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:04,221
so not really.

81
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:06,389
Wavy‐head just had
to be at the top.

82
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,475
What about the school
going after us, then?

83
00:05:08,517 --> 00:05:10,894
Says it right here!

84
00:05:10,936 --> 00:05:12,771
[TAKEZO]
Hakuto High School?

85
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:14,105
That doesn't ring a bell.

86
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:17,108
Ahh. Well. Doesn't matter, then.

87
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,151
They're right after us,

88
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:20,987
so we'll be too busy cleaning
up to hear them anyway.

89
00:05:29,538 --> 00:05:32,958
What are you doing
on the ground, mister?

90
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,626
Listening to the wind.

91
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:37,087
It's beautiful.

92
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:42,384
The break'll be over soon,
so let's get going.

93
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:45,679
I don't remember any of the
performances after Meiryo's.

94
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,681
Me neither. That guy
said all they had to do

95
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:50,225
was outshine everyone
who played after them,

96
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:52,269
and I guess they did.

97
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:55,313
Sure, maybe, but that's
just until we perform.

98
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:56,606
We're gonna destroy them.

99
00:05:56,648 --> 00:05:59,359
Then everyone'll
forget about them and‐‐

100
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:00,777
Oh, sorry.

101
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:03,905
[SENTAROU]
Where are you looking, idiot?

102
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:06,074
[CHIKA]
Hmm? Uh...

103
00:06:06,116 --> 00:06:07,075
My bad, man.

104
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:08,660
I didn't see you there.

105
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:10,579
What the hell.

106
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,663
Are you kidding me?

107
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:14,165
Are you trying to pick a
fight with me, you bastard?

108
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:17,002
Do yourself a favor and
revaluate who you're talking to.

109
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:18,545
I don't have the time
to get into fights

110
00:06:18,587 --> 00:06:19,796
with middle schoolers.

111
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:21,381
Take your own advice.

112
00:06:21,423 --> 00:06:22,340
You sonnuva‐‐!

113
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:24,926
Whoa, whoa! Sen, what
are you doing? Calm down!

114
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:25,802
Let me go, Haru!

115
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:27,929
This guy insulted me
and now he's gonna pay!

116
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:28,680
[CHIKA]
What?

117
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:30,473
When did I insult you?
Don't lie!

118
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:31,975
[TAKEZO]
Hey! Kudo!

119
00:06:32,017 --> 00:06:35,937
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry!
He means no ill‐will, I promise!

120
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:38,356
It's okay! Please accept
our apologies as well.

121
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:40,775
Don't apologize,
I didn't do anything!

122
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:43,028
I take it you guys will
be playing today, too?

123
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:44,404
Oh, uh, yeah!

124
00:06:44,446 --> 00:06:47,532
We're the koto club from Eidai
Fuzoku High School in Ibaraki.

125
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:48,533
Sorry again.

126
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,243
[CHIKA]
You're high school students?

127
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:52,370
I'm, uh, sorry.

128
00:06:53,622 --> 00:06:55,040
[SENTAROU]
Don't screw with me!

129
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:57,417
[CHIKA]
What? I just said I'm sorry!

130
00:06:57,459 --> 00:07:00,629
That guy can't get along
with Chika at all, huh?

131
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:01,963
[SATOWA]
Honestly.

132
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:05,425
I'm very sorry that my fellow
club member caused such trouble.

133
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:07,427
I'll give him
a talking to later.

134
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:08,720
So just this once,

135
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:11,765
could you find it in
yourself to let this slide?

136
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:16,811
Whoa! Sen, are you okay, buddy?

137
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:17,646
I'm so sorry!

138
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:18,813
We go to an all‐boys school,

139
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:20,649
so we're not used to
seeing girls our own age!

140
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:23,401
Haru! Shut it
or I'll shut it for you!

141
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:24,527
[laughs]

142
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:26,821
No way, did he actually
just get a nosebleed?

143
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:29,199
He must have seen Hozuki
and let his thoughts run wild!

144
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,994
Hey, you should go push his
buttons a little, Hozu... ki...

145
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,246
Disgusting.

146
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:36,915
You have zero tact,
you know that, Chika?

147
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:38,750
Who's laughing now, ya jerk?

148
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:39,876
That's what ya get!

149
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:40,877
All right.

150
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:43,880
I'm Chika Kudo, a first year
from Tokise High School.

151
00:07:43,922 --> 00:07:45,298
What's your name?

152
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:48,593
Sentarou Miya, a first year
from Eidai Fuzoku High.

153
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:51,846
I'll never lose to the
likes of you, yah hear me?

154
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:53,181
[CHIKA]
Let's go, Specs!

155
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:54,099
[SENTAROU]
Let's go, Haru!

156
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,809
We gotta prep!

157
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,519
[ISAKI] So this is
where they're playing?

158
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,979
Nice place.

159
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,438
Thanks for showing me

00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,300
I didn't think the
last school was bad.

318
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:47,053
It's not that
they're bad, honestly.

319
00:14:47,095 --> 00:14:48,971
They just put on a
boring performance.

320
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:51,557
It's probably a problem
with their coach.

321
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:54,685
Isn't the daughter of a grand
master teaching Chika

322
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,229
and the members of his club?

323
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,814
That's gotta be pretty rough.

324
00:14:57,855 --> 00:14:58,648
I wonder if there's anyone

325
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:00,608
who's not a student
who could teach them.

326
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:03,111
Actually, now that
I think about it,

327
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:05,530
they do have an
advisor, Mr. Takinami.

328
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:06,739
Takinami?

329
00:15:06,781 --> 00:15:07,532
[TETSUKI]
Yeah.

330
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:09,117
What, has Chika mentioned him?

331
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:12,078
Well, no, I was just thinking
about how back in high school,

332
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:15,748
I had an upperclassman
with the same last name.

333
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:16,958
Have you ever heard of them?

334
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:20,711
That power couple, the world‐
famous conductor Kaoru Takinami

335
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:23,464
and the genius pianist,
Tsukasa Yukimori?

336
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:26,217
Their son went to my school
and was two grades above me.

337
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:28,469
[TETSUKI] I hadn't,
but the son must be talented.

338
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:30,346
You'd think so, but
actually he was considered

339
00:15:30,388 --> 00:15:33,099
a disappointment
to their elite family.

340
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:36,310
Apparently,
he didn't play music at all.

341
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:40,523
But I distinctly remember
one day when I did see him.

342
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:42,733
[STUDENT]
Hey, Takinami!

343
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,528
So, rumor has it
that you're the son

344
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:48,281
of that famous conductor,
Kaoru Takinami.

345
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:50,116
Our usual club advisor
isn't here today.

346
00:15:50,158 --> 00:15:52,618
Think you could
conduct us a little?

347
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,495
[TAKINAMI]
That's presumptuous.

348
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:55,163
To be frank,

349
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:58,499
I'm not interested in your sound
enough to want to conduct you.

350
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:00,209
Try again when you're better.

351
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:01,043
[STUDENT]
Huh?

352
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:02,962
What's your problem?

353
00:16:03,004 --> 00:16:06,257
I'm not sure why, but I've
never forgotten that incident.

354
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:09,385
It still makes me wonder if he
really was a "disappointment."

355
00:16:09,427 --> 00:16:10,470
Interesting.

356
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:12,388
See, the thing is,
there was also a rumor

357
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:15,641
that he was a prodigy that just
decided not to play music.

358
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:17,852
But I don't know whether
it was true or not.

359
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:18,561
Oh man.

360
00:16:18,603 --> 00:16:20,855
His first name's on
the tip of my tongue.

361
00:16:20,897 --> 00:16:22,523
Happen to be Suzuka?

362
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:24,066
Yeah, that was it!

363
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:25,443
Suzuka!

364
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:38,164
[MUSICIAN C]
Kaoru.

365
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:39,874
Is Suzuka still not
showing any interest

366
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:41,709
in learning an instrument?

367
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:43,628
Nah. Every day, all
he does is lie there

368
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,963
listening to music
from morning until night.

369
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:48,508
But his older sister
Kiyoka plays the piano.

370
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:50,092
Can't you just make
him play an instrument?

371
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:51,427
He'd probably love it.

372
00:16:51,469 --> 00:16:52,762
It's okay.

373
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:54,931
You can't force someone to play.

374
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:57,391
If he really wants to get
involved with creating music,

375
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:58,476
he will.

376
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:06,567
Hey, buddy.

377
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:08,569
Whatcha yah up to, there?

378
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:10,071
I just finished a piece.

379
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:10,863
Wow.

380
00:17:10,905 --> 00:17:12,698
Composing at such a young age.

381
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:13,950
That's amazing!

382
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:15,660
Let me see!

383
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:18,663
I knew Suzuka wanted to do
more than just listen to music.

384
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:20,122
Okay.

385
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:21,249
Seriously?

386
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:24,043
This is a score for
a whole orchestra!

387
00:17:24,085 --> 00:17:25,336
Suzuka, please tell me,

388
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:27,630
where and when did you learn
to write a score like this?

389
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:29,715
I've been writing them for
as long as I can remember,

390
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:31,801
so I guess I don't know.

391
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:33,970
Not that I have any
interest in playing myself,

392
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:35,638
but I love to listen to music.

393
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,516
Though I've listened to most
of the stuff we have at home.

394
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:39,809
So sometimes I'll think

395
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:43,187
"I'd love to listen to this kind
of piece!" but never find it.

396
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:45,773
When that happens,
I just write it myself.

397
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:46,983
He's a genius!

398
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:49,068
I knew he'd be like
his mother and father!

399
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:51,487
Most college students
couldn't compose this,

400
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:53,030
yet he's done it at seven?

401
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,157
We don't have to make
such a big fuss about it.

402
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:57,535
Why don't we just
let him do his thing?

403
00:17:57,577 --> 00:17:59,120
Don't be like that,
you've got a prodigy!

404
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:00,997
You have to nurture his talent!

405
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:01,664
That's it!

406
00:18:01,706 --> 00:18:03,874
Let's play this song
at our next concert!

407
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,251
I bet he it would
be a great fit

408
00:18:05,293 --> 00:18:07,295
for our next television
appearance!

409
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:09,463
[TAKINAMI]
At first, I was happy about it.

410
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:10,631
Getting to hear what I wrote

411
00:18:10,673 --> 00:18:13,843
played by professionals
was exciting.

412
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:15,261
But, day by day,

413
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:18,598
as they continued to make
such a big deal about it,

414
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:20,975
the beautiful and endlessly
free world of music

415
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:24,604
suddenly became
rigid and boring.

416
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:29,358
Finally, I couldn't
take it anymore.

[KIYOKA]
I just heard.

418

So you're going to stay
with our uncle in Japan?

You know why,

422
00:18:40,328 --> 00:18:43,080
it's cus everyone here wants
to suck me into the music world.

423
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,915
Why not get sucked into it?

424
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:47,126
You like music, don't you?

00:18:47,168 --> 00:18:48,294
'Course I do.

426
00:18:48,336 --> 00:18:50,630
That's why I don't
want to get involved.

427
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:54,592
Music is at its best when it's
just being genuinely enjoyed.

428
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:55,718
It makes no sense.

429
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,595
Why would I want to live
in the world of music

430
00:18:57,637 --> 00:18:58,763
when there are
people like you

who look like they're suffering?

432

[KIYOKA]
Well, sorry for "suffering."

433
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:05,144
Unfortunately, I'm not
a genius like some people.

434
00:19:05,186 --> 00:19:07,271
But I also won't quit.

I've been nervous
this whole time,

but the closer we
get the sicker I feel.

starting to ache.

Just like how I felt before
we did "Ryuuseigun."

to be so jittery now.

00:20:26,517 --> 00:20:28,519
This one's yours,
safe and sound.

476
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:30,438
Cool, you brought
your grandpa's koto?

477
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:31,188
Good idea!

478
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,107
What better time
to break it out?

479
00:20:33,149 --> 00:20:35,651
Well, I have been using
it at home this whole time.

480
00:20:35,693 --> 00:20:38,195
But this is your first time
using it on a stage, right?

481
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:41,574
That means Gen's koto is finally
going to see the light of day.

482
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:44,452
I'm sure that makes
him very happy.

483
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:46,120
I guess so.

484
00:20:46,162 --> 00:20:48,539
Oh. Hozuki.

485
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:51,375
You take my koto inside instead.

486
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:53,502
I'll bring in the 17‐string.

487
00:20:53,544 --> 00:20:54,920
Uh...

488
00:20:56,464 --> 00:20:58,174
Leave it to me.

489
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:02,386
Kurusu, could you
do me a huge favor

490
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:03,512
and head to
the drop‐off spot

491
00:21:03,554 --> 00:21:05,514
and tell everyone
there what to do?

492
00:21:05,556 --> 00:21:07,141
I was gonna go register us.

493
00:21:07,183 --> 00:21:08,601
Oh!

494
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:10,728
Mr. Takinami!

495
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:11,979
Perfect timing!

496
00:21:12,021 --> 00:21:14,857
Could you carry this koto
the rest of the way for me?

497
00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:16,400
I wanted to go
get us registered‐‐

498
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:18,319
I already registered you.

499
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,112
Wait, what? You did?

500
00:21:20,154 --> 00:21:21,489
What's that supposed to mean?

501
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:24,700
The advisor is supposed
to be registering you guys.

502
00:21:24,742 --> 00:21:26,994
[TAKEZO] I just thought
you must've forgotten.

503
00:21:27,036 --> 00:21:29,121
Well, I didn't forget.

504
00:21:30,623 --> 00:21:32,333
Oh. There's fine, Hiro.

505
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:34,752
I'm going to place the bridges
and quickly tune that one.

506
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:37,963
So you can just
leave it where it is.

507
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:39,840
Okay, gotcha.
Sorry about that.

508
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:44,845
[SATOWA]
The kotos!

509
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:47,306
[CHIKA]
Hozuki!

510
00:21:52,228 --> 00:21:54,146
[SANE]
Hey, are you okay?

511
00:21:54,188 --> 00:21:56,357
The two of you didn't
get hurt, did you?

512
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:57,733
I'm fine, don't worry about me.

513
00:21:57,775 --> 00:21:59,485
Just worry about the kotos!

514
00:21:59,527 --> 00:22:01,612
They both look good to me.

515
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:02,404
Oh, no.

516
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:04,281
That was all
my fault, wasn't it?

517
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:05,533
I'm so sorry!

518
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:06,242
It's okay.

519
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:08,077
Nothing was damaged.

520
00:23:57,019 --> 00:23:59,980
[SATOWA]
Next time, "Kuon."
