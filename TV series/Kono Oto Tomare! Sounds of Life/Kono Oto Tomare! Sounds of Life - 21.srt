00:08:57,817 --> 00:09:00,567
Oh shut up! How am I supposed
to get better without playing!

157
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:02,442
[TAKEZO] I'm just saying,
be a little more mindful!

158
00:09:02,525 --> 00:09:04,358
[CHIKA]
I don't need your advice!

159
00:09:04,442 --> 00:09:06,442
--[TAKEZO] Hey! I said no!
--[CHIKA] Get off of me!

160
00:09:06,525 --> 00:09:08,483
[BOTH panting]

161
00:09:08,567 --> 00:09:11,025
Dammit! What are we even doing?

162
00:09:11,108 --> 00:09:13,317
We wasted all that time
I coulda been working!

163
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,733
It was a good diversion,
don't you think?

164
00:09:17,358 --> 00:09:18,650
You know what?

165
00:09:18,733 --> 00:09:21,775
There's something I've been
wondering about lately.

166
00:09:21,858 --> 00:09:23,817
And it has to do
with your sound.

167
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,025
What is it?

168
00:09:25,108 --> 00:09:28,775
Well, to put it bluntly,
it sometimes shines.

169
00:09:28,858 --> 00:09:30,525
Uh. Like a light?

170
00:09:30,608 --> 00:09:36,567
[TAKEZO] Yeah. Sometimes.
Very gently. And warmly.

171
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:37,900
But it shines.

172
00:09:39,983 --> 00:09:43,858
I've been curious why your sound
feels that way for a while now.

173
00:09:43,942 --> 00:09:46,400
But I think I finally
know what it is.

174
00:09:48,733 --> 00:09:50,317
[TAKEZO]
When it comes down to it,

175
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,608
that sound is your soul itself.

176
00:09:53,775 --> 00:09:55,317
[gasps]

177
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,400
[GEN]
The song is their soul.

178
00:09:58,733 --> 00:10:03,150
[TAKEZO gasps] Shoot! I just
spoke my mind without thinking!

179
00:10:03,233 --> 00:10:04,733
[CHIKA]
What's up with you, man?

180
00:10:04,817 --> 00:10:07,733
You must've hit your
head or something.

181
00:10:07,817 --> 00:10:10,525
Yeah, I shouldn't
have said that.

182
00:10:10,608 --> 00:10:14,108
[GEN] Listen up, Chika.
Sound is special.

183
00:10:14,192 --> 00:10:16,567
It touches people's souls.

184
00:10:17,942 --> 00:10:20,233
[GEN] And pieces of music
are basically the souls

185
00:10:20,317 --> 00:10:23,525
of their composers
in physical form.

186
00:10:23,608 --> 00:10:25,608
[CHIKA] I don't know what
this piece means to you,

187
00:10:25,692 --> 00:10:27,567
but maybe we could
face it together.

188
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:31,150
[SATOWA] Well, um. Honestly,
when I played this piece,

189
00:10:31,233 --> 00:10:32,983
I was hoping the people
who listened to it

190
00:10:33,067 --> 00:10:34,233
would want to smile.

191
00:10:34,317 --> 00:10:35,358
[TAKINAMI] Look at the
piece in its entirety.

192
00:10:35,442 --> 00:10:36,650
Understand its flow.

193
00:10:36,733 --> 00:10:38,733
[gasps]

194
00:10:38,817 --> 00:10:40,817
[DOJIMA]
Akira. We have guests.

195
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:43,483
Do me a favor and go
prepare some tea for them.

196
00:10:43,567 --> 00:10:44,817
Why do we have--?

197
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,358
[gasps]

198
00:10:46,442 --> 00:10:49,483
[AKIRA] Mr. Takagi. The others
are all senior members

199
00:10:49,567 --> 00:10:52,150
of the Hozuki School, too.

200
00:10:52,233 --> 00:10:54,025
[DOJIMA] Don't miss your
chance to say hello

201
00:10:54,108 --> 00:10:55,733
before they're gone.

202
00:10:55,817 --> 00:10:59,275
Oh, and make enough tea
for the grand master.

203
00:10:59,358 --> 00:11:00,775
[AKIRA]
Grandmother.

204
00:11:00,858 --> 00:11:04,900
Excuse me, but is it okay if I
sit in on the meeting?

205
00:11:06,567 --> 00:11:11,483
[DOJIMA] Hm! Certainly.
Come with me.

206
00:11:11,567 --> 00:11:14,192
[DOJIMA] I don't like
the look in her eyes.

207
00:11:14,275 --> 00:11:17,858
Not that she could do
anything to mess this up.

208
00:11:17,942 --> 00:11:22,775
It'll be fine. She can just
sit there and watch quietly.

209
00:11:22,858 --> 00:11:25,067
And since she's been taking
her time shutting down

210
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:29,650
that club, I'll be the one
to end it for good.

211
00:11:29,733 --> 00:11:32,525
Let's begin.
What's this meeting about?

212
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,108
[DOJIMA] I have gathered
you all here today

213
00:11:39,192 --> 00:11:42,483
in order to discuss the
grand master's daughter.

214
00:11:42,567 --> 00:11:44,608
As you're aware,
she was excommunicated

215
00:11:44,692 --> 00:11:47,192
after causing trouble for
the school in the past.

216
00:11:47,275 --> 00:11:49,733
But what you don't know is she
is about to put the school

217
00:11:49,817 --> 00:11:51,817
in jeopardy yet again.

218
00:11:53,317 --> 00:11:55,483
And how is she going to do that?

219
00:11:55,567 --> 00:11:58,192
Satowa now belongs to a
koto club at the high school

220
00:11:58,275 --> 00:11:59,525
she's attending.

221
00:11:59,608 --> 00:12:02,108
But I assure you, it is a
koto club in name only.

222
00:12:02,192 --> 00:12:04,067
In reality, the members
are nothing but

223
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:05,483
a group of delinquents.

224
00:12:05,567 --> 00:12:06,900
[AKIRA gasps]

225
00:12:06,983 --> 00:12:09,608
[TAKAGI'S SON laughs]
Oh, you'll have to forgive me.

226
00:12:09,692 --> 00:12:11,650
I was expecting something worse.

227
00:12:11,733 --> 00:12:13,900
[AKIRA]
That's Mr. Takagi's son.

228
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:15,692
I was curious why
you called us.

229
00:12:15,775 --> 00:12:17,275
But I didn't think
we'd be discussing

230
00:12:17,358 --> 00:12:18,900
this girl's club activities.

231
00:12:18,983 --> 00:12:20,900
This isn't exactly
something that we adults

232
00:12:20,983 --> 00:12:22,442
have to meet and talk about.

233
00:12:22,525 --> 00:12:24,650
Even if one of the delinquents
she's spending her time with

234
00:12:24,733 --> 00:12:26,567
has gotten in trouble
with the police?

235
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:28,108
[ALL gasp]

236
00:12:29,817 --> 00:12:31,233
[TETSUKI]
What? Chika?

237
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:33,192
You're not practicing
through lunch?

238
00:12:33,275 --> 00:12:35,192
Specs is forcing me
to lay off playing

239
00:12:35,275 --> 00:12:36,942
until my fingertips heal up.

240
00:12:37,025 --> 00:12:40,650
Huh? Oh, I see you practiced
so much you hurt yourself?

241
00:12:40,733 --> 00:12:42,650
Use your head
a little, ya idiot.

242
00:12:42,733 --> 00:12:44,067
[CHIKA]
Shut up.

243
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:45,858
[FEMALE STUDENT A] You're gonna
go practice now, Satowa?

244
00:12:45,942 --> 00:12:49,358
[SATOWA]
Yeah. I'll see you later, 'kay?

245
00:12:49,442 --> 00:12:51,192
[SATOWA gasps]
Oh, Kudo.

246
00:12:51,275 --> 00:12:53,442
Got a minute? I wanna talk.

247
00:12:53,525 --> 00:12:55,567
[MIYOSHI yelps]
What does that mean?

248
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:57,150
[DOJIMA]
I was worried about Satowa,

249
00:12:57,233 --> 00:12:59,192
so I investigated the club.

250
00:12:59,275 --> 00:13:01,775
And I found out that one of
its members named Kudo

251
00:13:01,858 --> 00:13:04,067
is something of a
famous criminal.

252
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:06,942
He's had several run-ins with
the police in recent years

253
00:13:07,025 --> 00:13:08,983
because of his
violent tendencies.

254
00:13:09,067 --> 00:13:10,567
He's dangerous?

255
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:12,317
[DOJIMA]
His grandfather builds kotos,

256
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,567
which explains his connection
to the instrument.

257
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:17,858
But last year, he had another
outrageous episode.

258
00:13:17,942 --> 00:13:19,150
He and his delinquent friends

259
00:13:19,233 --> 00:13:21,025
attacked his
grandfather's property.

260
00:13:21,108 --> 00:13:23,858
He has no respect for
authority or the koto.

261
00:13:23,942 --> 00:13:25,483
What do you mean
they "attacked?"

262
00:13:25,567 --> 00:13:27,608
This guy sounds more
like an actual criminal

263
00:13:27,692 --> 00:13:29,150
than a delinquent.

264
00:13:29,233 --> 00:13:30,525
[AKIRA gasps]

265
00:13:30,608 --> 00:13:32,858
[AKIRA]
Kudo did that?

266
00:13:32,942 --> 00:13:36,108
I really wanna know what
kind of piece "Tenkyu" is.

267
00:13:36,192 --> 00:13:38,733
"What kind of piece?"

268
00:13:38,817 --> 00:13:40,775
Exactly.

269
00:13:40,858 --> 00:13:44,025
I wanna know what was going
on in your life at the time,

270
00:13:44,108 --> 00:13:45,650
what you were thinking about,

271
00:13:45,733 --> 00:13:47,817
and who you created
the piece for.

272
00:13:49,858 --> 00:13:54,525
My grandpa once said
pieces of music are

273
00:13:54,608 --> 00:13:57,358
"the souls of their composers
in physical form."

274
00:14:00,275 --> 00:14:01,983
[CHIKA] So, I don't
wanna play it without

275
00:14:02,067 --> 00:14:03,983
knowing those things anymore.

276
00:14:04,067 --> 00:14:05,983
I have been so far,
and looking back,

277
00:14:06,067 --> 00:14:08,775
it feels like
something's missing.

278
00:14:08,858 --> 00:14:12,233
It would only be a story about
my family and its issues.

279
00:14:12,317 --> 00:14:14,108
Do you really think that
will help your performance

280
00:14:14,192 --> 00:14:15,525
the slightest bit?

281
00:14:15,608 --> 00:14:17,442
It would help like crazy!

282
00:14:17,525 --> 00:14:21,525
[gasps]

283
00:14:21,608 --> 00:14:22,900
[SATOWA]
Okay.

284
00:14:22,983 --> 00:14:25,400
So your point is that Satowa
is hanging out with

285
00:14:25,483 --> 00:14:26,650
this dangerous boy?

286
00:14:26,733 --> 00:14:29,108
That's right. I believe
she's harbored ill will

287
00:14:29,192 --> 00:14:31,692
towards the school since
her excommunication.

288
00:14:31,775 --> 00:14:35,317
So she and the boy sharing the
same club had me thinking.

289
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,900
There's a possibility that
they're plotting some sort of

290
00:14:37,983 --> 00:14:41,025
sanctimonious revenge
against the school.

291

Play it one more time.

294
00:14:45,608 --> 00:14:47,650
Don't worry, we're not
neglecting anything.

295
00:14:47,733 --> 00:14:51,067
[SATOWA] And so, I used the
performance to throw a tantrum.

296
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:54,858
[SATOWA] I think it'd be fun
to play the koto. Together.

297
00:14:54,942 --> 00:14:57,192
Satowa's behavior at
her final competition

298
00:14:57,275 --> 00:15:00,733
under our roof irreparably
damaged the Hozuki name.

299
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:03,400
We all must all do everything
possible to prevent any

300
00:15:03,483 --> 00:15:05,775
further damage to the
school's reputation.

301
00:15:05,858 --> 00:15:07,858
We must ask that they
disband the club,

302
00:15:07,942 --> 00:15:10,817
and have Satowa transfer
to another high school!

hear me? I'll speak up.

This is stupid.

307
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,442
My word, Akira.
What are you on about?

308
00:15:23,525 --> 00:15:24,900
[AKIRA]
I was holding my tongue.

But "revenge"?
That's ridiculous.

How do you feel justified
saying things like that

311
00:15:29,942 --> 00:15:32,567
when you don't know
anything about Kudo?

312
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:36,025
If anyone's plotting something,
it's you, Grandmother!

313
00:15:36,108 --> 00:15:38,358
You're snooping into
high school students' lives.

314
00:15:38,442 --> 00:15:41,525
And now you're just making
things up about them!

315
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:44,692
You're the only one
who's outrageous!

316
00:15:44,775 --> 00:15:46,108
So then,

317
00:15:46,192 --> 00:15:48,567
I take it you're familiar with
this student named Kudo?

318
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:51,942
[AKIRA] Yes. I've been giving
lessons to that koto club.

319
00:15:52,025 --> 00:15:55,483
The idea they're plotting
"revenge" is absolute nonsense.

320
00:15:55,567 --> 00:15:57,233
Oh, good. In that case--

321
00:15:57,317 --> 00:15:59,400
[DOJIMA]
Akira! Poor thing,

322
00:15:59,483 --> 00:16:02,067
you must be feeling under
the weather or something!

323
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:04,400
You clearly don't know
what you're saying.

324
00:16:04,483 --> 00:16:06,358
Why don't you go
lie down for a while?

325
00:16:06,442 --> 00:16:09,233
No thanks. I know exactly
what I'm saying.

326
00:16:09,317 --> 00:16:10,525
But what about you?

327
00:16:10,608 --> 00:16:12,858
Maybe you should take a
second look at yourself.

328
00:16:12,942 --> 00:16:14,233
[DOJIMA gasps]

329
00:16:14,317 --> 00:16:17,150
If I'm being honest,
because of preconceptions I had,

330
00:16:17,233 --> 00:16:19,650
I assumed the students of
this club were not serious

331
00:16:19,733 --> 00:16:21,983
about the koto myself.

332
00:16:22,067 --> 00:16:24,192
But I was mistaken.

333
00:16:24,275 --> 00:16:28,067
Kudo and Satowa, and of course
the other members too,

334
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:31,233
face the koto with
such sincerity.

335
00:16:31,317 --> 00:16:36,067
They just love the instrument
and want to become better at it.

336
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:37,608
Grandmother!

337
00:16:37,692 --> 00:16:40,900
You've always been the one who
can't face the koto head-on.

338
00:16:40,983 --> 00:16:42,442
[gasps]

339
00:16:42,525 --> 00:16:45,358
You just think of the
school's and your reputation.

340
00:16:45,442 --> 00:16:48,442
You drag other people down
to look better by comparison.

341
00:16:48,525 --> 00:16:52,067
Why don't you stop all that and
face the koto for a change?

342
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:55,317
[DOJIMA gasps] How can you
say that? Such disrespect!

343
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,108
Who do you think
you're talking to?

344
00:16:57,192 --> 00:16:59,983
[TAKAGI] Ms. Dojima.
I believe that's enough.

345
00:17:00,067 --> 00:17:03,567
You've put your granddaughter
in a very awkward position here.

346
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:05,317
[DOJIMA]
Mr. Takagi.

347
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,650
Now then, Akira.

348
00:17:06,733 --> 00:17:08,858
I'd like to hear your thoughts,
having taught him.

349
00:17:08,942 --> 00:17:10,942
Is the student Kudo really
someone who's going to be

350
00:17:11,025 --> 00:17:13,442
harmful to Satowa or the school?

351
00:17:13,525 --> 00:17:17,525
I don't know him well, or how
he may have acted in the past.

352
00:17:17,608 --> 00:17:22,317
But now, his attitude
towards the koto

353
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,858
is deeply earnest and sincere.

354
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:29,067
[TAKAGI]
Hm. So that's how it is.

355
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:30,650
Well, how do you all feel?

356
00:17:30,733 --> 00:17:33,233
In my opinion, we don't need to
be concerned as of right now.

357
00:17:33,317 --> 00:17:34,483
Please, hold on a second!

358
00:17:34,567 --> 00:17:36,525
Even if he's not
causing problems now,

359
00:17:36,608 --> 00:17:38,025
people don't change
so quickly!

360
00:17:38,108 --> 00:17:39,233
He's sure to cause trouble--

361
00:17:39,317 --> 00:17:41,317
[CHIHARU]
Stop it.

362
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,233
No further discussion of
this subject is needed.

363
00:17:44,317 --> 00:17:46,567
Ms. Dojima, please show
them out so we don't waste

364
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:47,733
more of their time.

365
00:17:47,817 --> 00:17:48,608
You agree with them?

366
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:50,150
Furthermore.

367
00:17:50,233 --> 00:17:52,650
I won't allow you to investigate
my daughter and her friends,

368
00:17:52,733 --> 00:17:55,400
and spout ridiculous
accusations at your leisure.

369
00:17:55,483 --> 00:17:56,817
It's deplorable!

370
00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:00,108
It's true that I have
excommunicated her,

371
00:18:00,192 --> 00:18:02,400
but she is still my daughter.

372
00:18:03,608 --> 00:18:05,942

[AKIRA]
Grand Master.

374
00:18:08,817 --> 00:18:11,317
[CHIHARU] For that club, she was
willing to get down on her

375
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,733
hands and knees to
ask a favor of me.

376
00:18:13,817 --> 00:18:16,358
For her friends.
It was worth it?

377
00:18:16,442 --> 00:18:18,233
Yes, I believe so.

378
00:18:18,317 --> 00:18:19,733
[CHIHARU]
Then, that's good.

Grand Master, why don't
you come see it?

382
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:31,692
[CHIHARU]
I'm sorry, but...

383
00:18:31,775 --> 00:18:34,483
...I no longer have
the right to do that.

384

385

[AKIRA]
Mr. Takagi.

386
00:18:40,275 --> 00:18:43,025
I'm sorry for behaving like that
in front of you and the others.

387
00:18:43,108 --> 00:18:44,608
Don't be.

388
00:18:44,692 --> 00:18:47,067
Truthfully, I was relieved to
find out that Hozuki still has

389
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:49,733
a young prospect with as
much backbone as you.

390
00:18:49,817 --> 00:18:52,900
I look forward to hearing
of your future successes.

Thank you very much.

[DOJIMA]
"Backbone" he says?

393
00:18:57,442 --> 00:18:59,233
That club is still
full of troublemakers!

394
00:18:59,317 --> 00:19:02,150
Someday they're gonna cause
problems and then you'll see!

395
00:19:02,233 --> 00:19:05,358
And when they do,
don't come crying to me!

396

[AKIRA exhales]

397
00:19:12,483 --> 00:19:15,150
[SATOWA]
That about covers it, I think.

398
00:19:15,233 --> 00:19:18,150
And not long after,
I composed "Tenkyu".

399
00:19:19,858 --> 00:19:22,858
I understand. Got it. Thanks.

400
00:19:26,483 --> 00:19:28,983
Do you think it'd be
possible to tell the others

401
00:19:29,067 --> 00:19:30,900
what you just told me?

402
00:19:30,983 --> 00:19:32,608
I finally feel like I
can figure out

403
00:19:32,692 --> 00:19:34,900
how to approach that
piece now, y'know?

404
00:19:34,983 --> 00:19:37,650
I doubt they would want to
hear about my family history!

405
00:19:37,733 --> 00:19:39,442
I mean, sure, it might
be boring if it were

406
00:19:39,525 --> 00:19:41,567
coming from someone
we don't care about.

407
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:42,900
But this is different.

408
00:19:42,983 --> 00:19:45,108
[gasps]
Different?

00:19:48,983 --> 00:19:50,858
We care about you.

[CHIKA] Well, it's not
like I'm gonna force you.

411

[SATOWA] Why? Why is Kudo
always like this? Every time.

[SATOWA gasps] Kudo. I'm
treating you to some ice cream.

413
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:11,150
What? Why would you do that?

414
00:20:11,233 --> 00:20:13,108
[SATOWA]
I just feel like it.

415
00:20:13,192 --> 00:20:18,025
[SATOWA] I wonder...
if someday, I could return it.

416
00:20:18,108 --> 00:20:23,567
The same amount of warmth...
that you gave me.

417
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:26,567
[SATOWA]
Someday.

418
00:20:27,692 --> 00:20:31,192
[TAKINAMI]
There... Did you hear that?

419
00:20:31,275 --> 00:20:33,483
It's the spot where the parts
change and we enter the main

420
00:20:33,567 --> 00:20:34,608
segment of the piece.

421
00:20:34,692 --> 00:20:36,442
The handoffs are
a little sloppy,

422
00:20:36,525 --> 00:20:37,942
can we make them smoother?

423
00:20:38,025 --> 00:20:39,317
[TAKEZO]
Smoother?

424
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,025
So smooth the listener can't
tell when they happened.

425
00:20:42,108 --> 00:20:44,150
From then on, you each
gradually build up

426
00:20:44,233 --> 00:20:46,025
and show off the color
of your sounds.

427
00:20:46,108 --> 00:20:48,067
So you're free to go wild.

428
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:50,358
Just make sure you
keep the tempo.

429
00:20:50,442 --> 00:20:51,817
[AKIRA]
That makes sense.

430
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,567
[TAKINAMI] That's the
best part of the piece,

431
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:56,775
so use your own sound to play
it to your heart's content.

432
00:20:56,858 --> 00:21:01,317
Oh, and Hozuki. You play the
start of the song quite softly.

433
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,358
But do you think you could
make it a little more tense?

434
00:21:03,442 --> 00:21:05,317
Why do you want me
to make it tense?

435
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,567
[TAKINAMI] You're probably
doing it unconsciously,

436
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:10,358
but your sound is
pretty gentle overall.

437
00:21:10,442 --> 00:21:14,442
And to me, that says you deny
your previous performance.

438
00:21:14,525 --> 00:21:17,108
But that sound of yours
had incredible power.

439
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:19,942
You shouldn't throw
that away. Use it.

440
00:21:20,025 --> 00:21:21,692
By putting that sound
into the piece,

441
00:21:21,775 --> 00:21:24,858
the other parts will shine more.

442
00:21:24,942 --> 00:21:26,108
[gasps]

443
00:21:29,483 --> 00:21:30,858
Then I'll do it.

444
00:21:33,233 --> 00:21:36,358
[AKIRA] It sounds like this
will be an amazing performance.

445
00:21:38,275 --> 00:21:41,650
[AKIRA] I wonder when
the last time was.

446
00:21:41,733 --> 00:21:43,942
That I felt excited like this.

447
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:48,442
[TAKEZO]
And so...

448
00:21:48,525 --> 00:21:51,525
...with each of us showing our
emotions through our sound...

449
00:22:05,525 --> 00:22:09,817
[TAKEZO] The qualifier for
nationals was about to begin.
