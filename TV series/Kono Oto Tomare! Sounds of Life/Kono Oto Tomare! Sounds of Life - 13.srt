1
00:00:19,858 --> 00:00:21,275
[CHIKA]
Hozuki!

2
00:00:24,233 --> 00:00:26,317
The two of you didn't
get hurt, did you?

3
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,275
Oh no, that was all
my fault, wasn't it?

4
00:00:28,358 --> 00:00:29,525
I am so sorry!

5
00:00:29,608 --> 00:00:31,442
It's okay, nothing was damaged.

6
00:00:31,525 --> 00:00:32,358
[HIRO]
What should I do?

7
00:00:32,442 --> 00:00:34,025
How could I be so careless?

8
00:00:34,108 --> 00:00:35,733
Not only could I have
damaged the kotos,

9
00:00:35,817 --> 00:00:38,233
I almost hurt both
Chika and Hozuki!

10
00:00:38,317 --> 00:00:39,442
I can't believe
I messed up like that

11
00:00:39,525 --> 00:00:41,192
right before our performance!

12
00:00:41,275 --> 00:00:43,275
What's wrong with me?

13
00:00:43,358 --> 00:00:44,608
[TAKEZO]
Kurusu.

14
00:00:44,692 --> 00:00:47,567
Everything's fine.

15
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:48,775
You see.

16
00:00:48,858 --> 00:00:50,900
There's something my
upperclassman said once.

17
00:00:50,983 --> 00:00:52,442
She told me,

18
00:00:52,525 --> 00:00:55,567
the stage is a reward for all
the hard work you've put in.

19
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:59,025
That's why you have to
enjoy it as much as you can.

20
00:00:59,108 --> 00:01:01,483
We've worked really
hard for this moment.

21
00:01:01,567 --> 00:01:03,650
Now all that's left is not
to worry about messing up

22
00:01:03,733 --> 00:01:05,442
and just enjoy playing.

23
00:01:05,525 --> 00:01:07,525
I guess what
I'm trying to say is

24
00:01:07,608 --> 00:01:09,775
we all need a
pep talk sometime.

25
00:01:09,858 --> 00:01:10,775
[HIRO]
Hmph.

26
00:01:10,858 --> 00:01:12,942
You're so lame.

27
00:01:13,025 --> 00:01:14,858
[KOTA chuckles]

28
00:01:14,942 --> 00:01:16,192
Well, if it's any consolation,

29
00:01:16,275 --> 00:01:18,275
your speech made me
feel better, Takezo!

30
00:01:18,358 --> 00:01:19,900
[MITTSU]
Yeah, me too!

31
00:01:19,983 --> 00:01:22,442
Hey. Let's hurry
and set up the bridges.

32
00:01:22,525 --> 00:01:24,275
[CHIKA]
Sure.

33
00:01:36,608 --> 00:01:38,400
Kudo. Let's have a chat.

34
00:01:38,483 --> 00:01:40,483
Just what the hell do
you think you're doing, Teach?

35
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:42,483
Let go of me!

36
00:03:16,775 --> 00:03:18,275
[CHIKA]
Uh.

37
00:03:18,358 --> 00:03:20,650
You know boys don't do the whole
bathroom in pairs thing, right?

38
00:03:20,733 --> 00:03:23,442
[TAKINAMI] That's not
why we're here, idiot.

39
00:03:23,525 --> 00:03:24,108
Ah!

40
00:03:24,192 --> 00:03:25,192
Ugh, pathetic.

41
00:03:25,275 --> 00:03:27,192
Shut up, get off me!

42
00:03:27,275 --> 00:03:29,400
Listen. You're not
performing today.

43
00:03:29,483 --> 00:03:32,233
Go find first-aid station and
have them look at your hand.

44
00:03:32,317 --> 00:03:33,483
[CHIKA]
What?

45
00:03:33,567 --> 00:03:35,400
Cut the crap, besides
it's not even that bad!

46
00:03:35,483 --> 00:03:37,483
Seriously? Look,
this has nothing to do

47
00:03:37,567 --> 00:03:39,067
with whether you're okay or not,

48
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:40,650
but if something happens to
you out on stage,

49
00:03:40,733 --> 00:03:43,067
then I become responsible
as your advisor.

50
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,608
Nothing you say
can change my mind.

51
00:03:44,692 --> 00:03:46,442
I'm going to perform!

52
00:03:46,525 --> 00:03:48,358
And you don't need
to worry about me.

53
00:03:48,442 --> 00:03:50,192
It's not like I'm gonna
blame you or anything.

54
00:03:50,275 --> 00:03:52,025
Especially since
it's my decision.

55
00:03:52,108 --> 00:03:53,275
That'd be dumb.

56
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:54,900
No, dumb would be
hurting your playing hand

57
00:03:54,983 --> 00:03:57,358
right before a big
performance, don't you think?

58
00:03:57,442 --> 00:03:58,900
Ugh, shuddup!

59
00:03:58,983 --> 00:03:59,983
[TAKINAMI] It's not
like this performance

60
00:04:00,067 --> 00:04:01,942
is a preliminary
for the nationals.

61
00:04:02,025 --> 00:04:03,858
It's no big deal
if you skip out on it.

62
00:04:03,942 --> 00:04:06,317
Kurata's playing
first koto, too.

63
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,192
We can just have him
do the duet part alone

64
00:04:08,275 --> 00:04:09,942
and cut your
solo entirely.

65
00:04:10,025 --> 00:04:11,817
Problem solved.

66
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,442
Face the facts, Kudo.

67
00:04:13,525 --> 00:04:15,983
We don't need you
for this performance.

68
00:04:17,067 --> 00:04:18,483
Since we've got that settled.

69
00:04:18,567 --> 00:04:20,858
You should probably head
to the first-aid station.

70
00:04:20,942 --> 00:04:23,900
I'll let the club know
what we've decided.

71
00:04:25,567 --> 00:04:27,025
[CHIKA]
Like I said.

72
00:04:27,108 --> 00:04:30,317
My hand's perfectly fine,
so I'm going to perform.

73
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,900
I never expected you to be
so passionate about this club.

74
00:04:33,983 --> 00:04:35,942
Is that what's driving
you right now?

75
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:37,233
Or maybe it's adrenaline?

76
00:04:37,317 --> 00:04:40,150
[CHIKA] I love playing
with everyone, okay?

77
00:04:40,233 --> 00:04:42,275
I don't wanna just watch
from the sidelines.

78
00:04:42,358 --> 00:04:44,567
I'm part of that group.

79
00:04:49,567 --> 00:04:50,733
[CHIKA]
I'm doing it.

80
00:04:50,817 --> 00:04:53,858
So, don't you dare tell
anyone about my hand.

81
00:04:58,442 --> 00:04:59,900
[TAKINAMI]
Face the facts, Kudo.

82
00:04:59,983 --> 00:05:02,567
We don't need you
for this performance.

83
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:04,400
We don't need you.

84
00:05:08,358 --> 00:05:09,817
[CHIKA]
Damn it.

85
00:05:12,733 --> 00:05:14,483
[TAKINAMI]
What's up, Kurata?

86
00:05:14,567 --> 00:05:17,275
It's weird to wait for people
outside the bathroom.

87
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:19,108
Can you be serious?

88
00:05:19,192 --> 00:05:21,483
[sighs]
I take it you heard?

89
00:05:21,567 --> 00:05:24,692
Fine, in that case you can
handle all this nonsense.

90
00:05:24,775 --> 00:05:26,358
It's a pain in the ass.

91
00:05:26,442 --> 00:05:27,400
I don't get you.

92
00:05:27,483 --> 00:05:29,692
Do you enjoy
testing us all the time?

93
00:05:29,775 --> 00:05:31,983
You say things that
rub people the wrong way,

94
00:05:32,067 --> 00:05:33,775
and it seems intentional.

95
00:05:33,858 --> 00:05:34,900
Is that how you see it?

96
00:05:34,983 --> 00:05:36,858
I don't put that
much thought into it,

97
00:05:36,942 --> 00:05:39,067
only say what's on my mind.

98
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:41,567
If this were really
about taking responsibility,

99
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:42,983
then why bring him here?

100
00:05:43,067 --> 00:05:44,192
You could have just taken him

101
00:05:44,275 --> 00:05:47,275
straight to the first-aid
station instead.

102
00:05:47,358 --> 00:05:48,817
[TAKINAMI]
I didn't think of that way.

103
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,983
There's always
next time, though.

104
00:05:56,858 --> 00:05:58,067
[TAKEZO sighs]

105
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:01,733
I never know what
Mister Takinami's thinking.

106
00:06:01,817 --> 00:06:03,442
And Kudo's hand.

107
00:06:03,525 --> 00:06:05,233
What should I do?

108
00:06:05,317 --> 00:06:06,567
What's the right decision?

109
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:09,692
[CHIKA] I love playing
with everyone, okay?

110
00:06:09,775 --> 00:06:11,858
I don't wanna just watch
from the sidelines.

111
00:06:11,942 --> 00:06:13,650
I'm part of that group.

112
00:06:22,358 --> 00:06:23,483
This sucks.

113
00:06:23,567 --> 00:06:25,942
It looks worse
than it did before.

114
00:06:26,025 --> 00:06:29,608
Ugh, and it hurts
a lot more too.

115
00:06:30,817 --> 00:06:34,067
[CHIKA] Oh. I might
actually be an idiot.

116
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:35,567
Also,

117
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:38,817
I can't believe I said all that
mushy crap about the club!

118
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,233
I'm acting like a child.

119
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:41,942
What's wrong with me?

120
00:06:44,775 --> 00:06:45,900
Yo, Sane. What's up?

121
00:06:45,983 --> 00:06:47,775
Man, you've got some
nerve acting all casual,

122
00:06:47,858 --> 00:06:49,317
where the heck are
you even at right now?

123
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,733
I mean, we've already
moved the instruments

124
00:06:50,817 --> 00:06:52,692
into the tuning room!

125
00:06:52,775 --> 00:06:55,358
We're gonna play the piece once
and then tune off of that.

126
00:06:55,442 --> 00:06:57,275
So you'd better hurry
and get your butt back here,

127
00:06:57,358 --> 00:07:00,317
because we've only got
the room for 30 minutes.

128
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,900
[CHIKA]
Play it once.

129
00:07:01,983 --> 00:07:04,775
Uh, I'm so sorry,
Sane, but the thing is,

130
00:07:04,858 --> 00:07:05,858
I'm kinda busy.

131
00:07:05,942 --> 00:07:08,400
Isaki's breakfast
upset my stomach.

132
00:07:08,483 --> 00:07:09,525
What?

133
00:07:09,608 --> 00:07:10,442
But I'll be there
for the performance.

134
00:07:10,525 --> 00:07:12,525
Are you for real?

135
00:07:12,608 --> 00:07:13,400
He hung up.

136
00:07:13,483 --> 00:07:15,400
So what did Chika say?

137
00:07:15,483 --> 00:07:18,150
[SANE] I think the poor guy has
a case of the nervous poops.

138
00:07:18,942 --> 00:07:20,608
How disgusting.

139
00:07:20,692 --> 00:07:22,525
[SANE] I guess breakfast
didn't agree with him.

140
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:23,483
What?

141
00:07:23,567 --> 00:07:25,650
[MIITSU]
Man, I've been there.

142
00:07:27,608 --> 00:07:28,525
[TAKINAMI]
Fine, in that case,

143
00:07:28,608 --> 00:07:30,567
you can handle all
this nonsense.

144
00:07:32,358 --> 00:07:34,567
Ugh, it's too swollen.

145
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:37,733
I can't put any
strength into it.

146
00:07:41,692 --> 00:07:44,900
That means Gen's koto is finally
going to see the light of day.

147
00:07:44,983 --> 00:07:48,650
I'm sure that makes
him very happy.

148
00:07:48,733 --> 00:07:51,525
[CHIKA sighs]

149
00:07:51,608 --> 00:07:54,025
I really wanna do this right.

150
00:07:56,108 --> 00:07:57,483
[SANE]
Come on, man.

151
00:07:57,567 --> 00:07:58,983
How long does it take
to go to the bathroom?

152
00:07:59,067 --> 00:08:01,150
It's almost our turn
to go on stage!

153
00:08:01,233 --> 00:08:02,817
Yeah, I'm starting
to get worried.

154
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,192
Do you think one of us
should go and check on him?

155
00:08:05,275 --> 00:08:06,733
I don't wanna rush the guy.

156
00:08:06,817 --> 00:08:08,942
I really hope that Chika's okay.

157
00:08:09,025 --> 00:08:11,692
He's been gone for so long,
I can't help but worry.

158
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:13,025
What do you think, Hozuki?

159
00:08:13,108 --> 00:08:15,275
If he's going to get sick
