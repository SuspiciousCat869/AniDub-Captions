1
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:26,067
[TAKEZO]
Strange.

2
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:28,567
The atmosphere seems
really tense today.

3
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:30,233
Please don't worry.

4
00:00:30,317 --> 00:00:31,400
Unlike you,

5
00:00:31,483 --> 00:00:33,900
I'm a good judge of character.

6
00:00:33,983 --> 00:00:34,983
Kurusu?

7
00:00:35,067 --> 00:00:36,400
[HIRO]
Yeah, what?

8
00:00:36,483 --> 00:00:39,775
[TAKEZO] I'm a little worried
about today's practice.

9
00:00:39,858 --> 00:00:42,400
Are you feeling
sick by any chance?

10
00:00:43,483 --> 00:00:44,650
Kurusu?

11
00:00:44,733 --> 00:00:46,108
What's the matter?

12
00:00:46,192 --> 00:00:49,025
[HIRO] Oh. It's nothing,
everything is hunky dory!

13
00:00:49,108 --> 00:00:49,858
Come on, then!

14
00:00:49,942 --> 00:00:51,233
We should start practicing!

15
00:00:51,317 --> 00:00:52,525
Uh. Okay.

16
00:00:57,025 --> 00:00:58,275
[CHIKA]
Crap.

17
00:00:58,358 --> 00:01:01,108
I didn't think things were
gonna be this awkward.

18
00:01:01,192 --> 00:01:02,900
Even though it was an accident,

19
00:01:02,983 --> 00:01:05,733
it was bad enough
to make her cry.

20
00:01:05,817 --> 00:01:08,317
I'm sure she'll forgive
me if I apologize.

21
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,900
Hozuki!

22
00:01:11,317 --> 00:01:13,858
[SATOWA] Why the heck am I
avoiding him all of the sudden?

23
00:01:13,942 --> 00:01:15,525
I should have
said something like:

24
00:01:15,608 --> 00:01:17,483
"Oh please, it's not
that big of a deal."

25
00:01:17,567 --> 00:01:19,942
Then things could have
gone back to normal!

26
00:01:20,025 --> 00:01:23,067
[MITTSU] Rawr!
Are there any naughty kids?

27
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:24,900
[KOTA]
We're gonna eat you!

28
00:01:24,983 --> 00:01:26,317
Just kidding, got ya!

29
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,817
Did you guys get scared?

30
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,942
You like the costumes that
we made for the haunted house?

31
00:01:31,025 --> 00:01:32,650
[MITTSU] Man, we must
have done a really good job

32
00:01:32,733 --> 00:01:34,650
because Chika and
Hozuki are speechless!

33
00:01:34,733 --> 00:01:35,358
[KOTA]
Hooray!

34
00:01:35,442 --> 00:01:36,900
It was a huge success!

35
00:03:10,192 --> 00:03:11,400
[HIRO]
Uh! Shoot!

36
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:13,192
I made another mistake!

37
00:03:13,275 --> 00:03:15,608
[CHIKA]
None of us are together.

38
00:03:15,692 --> 00:03:17,067
Yeah. That's it.

39
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:19,025
Let's call it quits for today.

40
00:03:19,108 --> 00:03:20,567
Wait, what for?

41
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:22,775
Nothing good is going to come
from poor quality practice.

42
00:03:22,858 --> 00:03:24,025
If you really wanna continue,

43
00:03:24,108 --> 00:03:27,150
then do it individually
and not as a group.

44
00:03:28,608 --> 00:03:30,942
[HIRO] It's my fault;
I couldn't focus at all.

45
00:03:31,025 --> 00:03:32,358
[SANE]
I'm sorry!

46
00:03:32,442 --> 00:03:35,400
I just need to practice more
with the 17-string.

47
00:03:35,483 --> 00:03:38,275
We're lacking unity because I
can't lead you like Hozuki can.

48
00:03:38,358 --> 00:03:40,817
So, I'll have
to try even harder!

49
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,275
[HIRO] I have no
business being distracted

50
00:03:42,358 --> 00:03:44,775
when everyone else
is working so hard.

51
00:03:44,858 --> 00:03:47,775
Even Suzu has been
more motivated lately.

52
00:03:47,858 --> 00:03:50,525
What's my problem?

53
00:03:50,608 --> 00:03:51,150
Come on!

54
00:03:51,233 --> 00:03:52,025
Go, again!

55
00:03:52,108 --> 00:03:53,358
But he just said.

56
00:03:53,442 --> 00:03:55,525
It's my fault because
I wasn't focused earlier.

57
00:03:55,608 --> 00:03:56,525
Sorry!

58
00:03:56,608 --> 00:03:57,900
I know Suzu told us to stop,

59
00:03:57,983 --> 00:03:59,942
but we don't have much
time left til the festival,

60
00:04:00,025 --> 00:04:02,233
so let's keep going!

61
00:04:02,317 --> 00:04:03,358
Yes, I agree.

62
00:04:03,442 --> 00:04:04,358
Hiro's right.

63
00:04:04,442 --> 00:04:05,233
Yay!

64
00:04:05,317 --> 00:04:06,317
Let's do this!

65
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,608
Right.

66
00:04:07,692 --> 00:04:09,108
[SATOWA] There's no
room for error right now.

67
00:04:09,192 --> 00:04:11,858
What's important is
preparing for the festival.

68
00:04:11,942 --> 00:04:13,775
[HIRO, SATOWA]
For the sake of the koto club.

69
00:04:13,858 --> 00:04:16,025
I need to rein
in these feelings.

70
00:04:18,525 --> 00:04:20,525
Hey. Are you all right?

71
00:04:20,608 --> 00:04:21,400
[HIRO]
Huh?

72
00:04:21,483 --> 00:04:22,400
Why wouldn't I be?

73
00:04:22,483 --> 00:04:24,650
Oh. You seemed
kinda out of it.

74
00:04:24,733 --> 00:04:26,358
Y'know, back at
practice earlier.

75
00:04:26,442 --> 00:04:27,650
Yeah, I'm okay.

76
00:04:27,733 --> 00:04:29,108
With the school
festival coming up,

77
00:04:29,192 --> 00:04:31,900
I've just been a little
more distracted than usual.

78
00:04:31,983 --> 00:04:32,733
[TAKEZO]
Ah.

79
00:04:32,817 --> 00:04:33,858
That makes sense.

80
00:04:33,942 --> 00:04:36,150
Sorry, I didn't mean
to make you worry.

81
00:04:36,233 --> 00:04:38,483
I'm sorry, Kudo.

82
00:04:38,567 --> 00:04:41,817
It was an accident, I should
haven't reacted like that.

83
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:44,442
You couldn't have known
that I was going to move.

84
00:04:44,525 --> 00:04:47,942
It's all my fault things felt
so weird during practice today.

85
00:04:48,025 --> 00:04:49,150
That's not true.

86
00:04:49,233 --> 00:04:52,483
Okay then, that should
clear everything up.

87
00:04:52,567 --> 00:04:54,358
Goodnight, see you tomorrow.

88
00:04:54,442 --> 00:04:56,358
Yeah. Bye.

89
00:04:58,858 --> 00:04:59,650
[TETSUKI]
Oh?

90
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:01,692
Sounds like it's all good, then.

91
00:05:01,775 --> 00:05:06,358
I dunno man, I have a weird
feeling about the whole thing.

92
00:05:06,442 --> 00:05:09,025
We should be back
to normal, right?

93
00:05:09,108 --> 00:05:09,942
Uh.

94
00:05:10,025 --> 00:05:11,358
Hey.

95
00:05:11,442 --> 00:05:12,442
Morning.

96
00:05:12,525 --> 00:05:13,858
Huh?

97
00:05:13,942 --> 00:05:15,192
Oh, so I was wondering.

98
00:05:15,275 --> 00:05:17,858
Sorry, I don't want to be late.

99
00:05:23,608 --> 00:05:25,608
[TETSUKI]
It's not her fault.

100
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:26,858
Yeah, it may have
been an accident,

101
00:05:26,942 --> 00:05:28,817
but it still made
her cry, right?

102
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,400
Her head wants
things to be normal.

103
00:05:30,483 --> 00:05:32,567
But the heart's more tricky.

104
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:34,025
[CHIKA]
Dammit!

105
00:05:34,108 --> 00:05:36,150
This wouldn't have happened
if I had quicker reflexes.

106
00:05:36,233 --> 00:05:37,775
[TETSUKI]
I doubt it.

107
00:05:37,858 --> 00:05:39,983
Anyway, try to give
her some space for now.

108
00:05:40,067 --> 00:05:42,692
Things will probably
go back to normal with time.

109
00:05:45,358 --> 00:05:46,858
[TAKEZO]
Hozuki?

110
00:05:46,942 --> 00:05:48,942
Do you have a shortlist ready
for the national qualifier yet?

111
00:05:49,025 --> 00:05:52,067
[SATOWA] Yes, I brought
a few pieces with me.

112
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:53,442
So cool!

113
00:05:53,525 --> 00:05:55,358
There are a lot of different
songs to choose from.

114
00:05:55,442 --> 00:05:57,025
[MITTSU]
This one is interesting.

115
00:05:57,108 --> 00:06:00,150
Hey, Chika, come look
at these CDs with us.

116
00:06:00,233 --> 00:06:01,525
Okay.

117
00:06:01,608 --> 00:06:03,442
So, what are they?

118
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,983
Let me see what you have, Sane.

119
00:06:09,525 --> 00:06:13,358
I just have to give
her time and space.

120
00:06:13,442 --> 00:06:15,733
Things will go back to normal.

121
00:06:21,525 --> 00:06:22,942
Haunted house!

122
00:06:23,025 --> 00:06:26,067
Please come check
out our haunted house!

123
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:27,400
Hi, Hiro!

124
00:06:27,483 --> 00:06:28,358
[HIRO]
Kota!

125
00:06:28,442 --> 00:06:30,233
[KOTA]
Aaww, cute costume!

126
00:06:30,317 --> 00:06:31,275
You look great!

127
00:06:31,358 --> 00:06:32,775
[HIRO giggles]
Thank you!

128
00:06:32,858 --> 00:06:33,942
But weren't you guys

129
00:06:34,025 --> 00:06:35,650
wearing different
costumes the other day?

130
00:06:35,733 --> 00:06:38,275
The girls in our class
didn't like them very much.

131
00:06:38,358 --> 00:06:39,858
We had to change.

132
00:06:39,942 --> 00:06:41,692
Well, they look nice!

133
00:06:44,317 --> 00:06:45,900
I'm so sorry I'm late!

134
00:06:47,942 --> 00:06:48,983
[TAKEZO]
Huh? No!

135
00:06:49,067 --> 00:06:50,150
It's fine.

136
00:06:50,233 --> 00:06:52,483
I'm sorry that you
had to shop by yourself.

137
00:06:52,567 --> 00:06:54,775
[HIRO]
Wow! He's so cute!

138
00:06:54,858 --> 00:06:55,567
No!

139
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:56,650
Is something wrong?

140
00:06:56,733 --> 00:06:58,067
[HIRO] A school festival
may seem safe,

141
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:00,567
but I can't let my guard down!

142
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:02,275
By the way, I like your costume.

143
00:07:02,358 --> 00:07:03,150
You look cute!

144
00:07:03,233 --> 00:07:04,317
Shut up before I hurt you!

145
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,692
Sorry, ma'am!

146
00:07:11,067 --> 00:07:13,317
[SATOWA] Thank you for waiting,
here's your matcha latte.

147
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,275
[STUDENT D]
Whoa, babe alert!

148
00:07:15,358 --> 00:07:17,108
Let's ditch the festival.

149
00:07:17,192 --> 00:07:18,817
You wanna go somewhere with me?

150
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,317
Sorry, but I still
have work to do.

151
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,525
[STUDENT C] Hold on,
we're not done talking yet.

152
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:23,650
[SATOWA]
Please let go of me.

153
00:07:23,733 --> 00:07:25,400
I will, right after you tell me

154
00:07:25,483 --> 00:07:27,442
a little bit more
about yourself.

155
00:07:27,525 --> 00:07:28,900
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

156
00:07:28,983 --> 00:07:30,483
Fine, my name is Chika Kudo,

157
00:07:30,567 --> 00:07:33,650
I'm a Virgo born on September
second and my blood type is O.

158
00:07:33,733 --> 00:07:35,983
Anything else you wanna know?

159
00:07:36,067 --> 00:07:38,233
Nope. That'll do it.

160
00:07:41,442 --> 00:07:42,983
[SATOWA]
What's wrong with me?

161
00:07:43,067 --> 00:07:45,358
Why can't I look
him in the eyes?

162
00:07:46,442 --> 00:07:48,567
My face feels so hot.

163
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:49,942

Were you able to get
permission to use the stage?

200
00:09:08,817 --> 00:09:09,900
As I recall,

you need at least
five people to get it.

202

Actually, the koto club
has seven members now.

Yes, you did.

I'll see you at the performance.

I'm really sorry, I should have
thought to introduce you to her.

That was really mean of me.

I can't get rid of
my feelings for him,

I'm the worst!

When we were first years,

232
00:10:12,108 --> 00:10:13,525
I was too busy tricking

233
00:10:13,608 --> 00:10:15,983
and hurting people
to get to know Kurata.

234

I just remember that he was
very involved with his club.

235
00:10:19,233 --> 00:10:21,775
Everyone made fun
of him, including me.

been through together,

their conversation.

00:13:50,817 --> 00:13:52,567
And really sudden.

327
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:59,400
I was super surprised
by how good you guys are

328
00:13:59,483 --> 00:14:01,608
and how many
members you have now!

329
00:14:01,692 --> 00:14:03,150
I appreciate that.

330
00:14:03,233 --> 00:14:05,900
I'm really glad our
hard work has paid off.

331
00:14:05,983 --> 00:14:07,275
Initially, I was
a little worried

332
00:14:07,358 --> 00:14:09,692
because I didn't want
to break my promise to you.

333
00:14:09,775 --> 00:14:11,483
About protecting the club.

334
00:14:11,567 --> 00:14:14,525
But then I made all
of these new friends.

335
00:14:14,608 --> 00:14:17,025
Luckily I remembered
everything you told me.

336
00:14:17,108 --> 00:14:20,275
And that's what I relied on
when things got tough.

337
00:14:20,358 --> 00:14:22,317
You mean it?

338
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,733
To be honest, Takezo,
I was actually kinda worried.

339
00:14:25,817 --> 00:14:28,108
I was afraid I'd put
too much pressure on you.

340
00:14:28,192 --> 00:14:30,858
Leaving the fate of the club
in your hands and everything.

341
00:14:30,942 --> 00:14:31,525
What?

342
00:14:31,608 --> 00:14:33,108
I guess in my eyes,

343
00:14:33,192 --> 00:14:36,275
laying those expectations on you
seemed pretty selfish, y'know?

344
00:14:36,358 --> 00:14:37,525
When I saw you standing alone

345
00:14:37,608 --> 00:14:39,983
at the clubroom on
our graduation day,

346
00:14:40,067 --> 00:14:42,067
I couldn't help but think about
how you'd have to recruit

347
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:45,442
more club members and perform
all the activities by yourself.

348
00:14:45,525 --> 00:14:46,983
I was worried
how you'd handle it

349
00:14:47,067 --> 00:14:49,525
and how much work it
was for one person.

350
00:14:49,608 --> 00:14:52,317
I was afraid that maybe I'd
burdened you with my words.

351
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,733
Backed you into a corner
that you couldn't get out of.

352
00:14:54,817 --> 00:14:56,608
What if I'd made the
club your responsibility

353
00:14:56,692 --> 00:14:59,733
only to have
it fall apart around you?

354
00:14:59,817 --> 00:15:01,442
Isn't that terrible?

355
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:03,942
It means I didn't have
complete faith in you.

356
00:15:04,025 --> 00:15:05,358
I'm really sorry.

357
00:15:05,442 --> 00:15:07,025
It's fine, no big deal.

358
00:15:07,108 --> 00:15:08,442
Are you serious?

359
00:15:08,525 --> 00:15:09,567
Of course I am.

360
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:11,067
It's okay.

361
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:13,983
Listen, I know you feel like
you didn't have faith in me.

362
00:15:14,067 --> 00:15:15,317
What you said.

363
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:18,025
Those words gave me power
when I needed it most.

364
00:15:21,942 --> 00:15:24,733
[MASHIRO] Y'know, you're acting
like a real club president.

365
00:15:24,817 --> 00:15:26,942
[TAKEZO]
Hey, who said it's acting?

366
00:15:29,983 --> 00:15:31,567
Look. Just be honest.

367
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:32,275
You...

368
00:15:32,358 --> 00:15:33,608
You know about me.

369
00:15:33,692 --> 00:15:34,608
Right?

370
00:15:34,692 --> 00:15:36,692
Huh? What do I know?

371
00:15:36,775 --> 00:15:38,858
[HIRO]
Come on, you have to know!

372
00:15:38,942 --> 00:15:41,650
Isn't that why you said
that thing earlier?

373
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:43,275
Did I say something?

374
00:15:43,358 --> 00:15:45,233
[HIRO]
Stop messing with me!

375
00:15:45,317 --> 00:15:47,483
I'll get rid of these
stupid feelings, okay?

376
00:15:47,567 --> 00:15:48,817
I'll make sure that
I won't cause trouble

377
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,275
for the rest of the club.

378
00:15:50,358 --> 00:15:51,942
So, please.

379
00:15:52,025 --> 00:15:54,192
Is there a reason why you
have to get rid of them?

380
00:15:54,275 --> 00:15:55,025
Well, yeah.

381
00:15:55,108 --> 00:15:56,567
It's because... You know...

382
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:58,733
Everybody in the club
is working so hard.

383
00:15:58,817 --> 00:16:01,067
I can't afford to be distracted.

384
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:03,567
It's not fair to the others
and it's selfish.

385
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:06,317
Look, you can't control what
you feel and more importantly.

386
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,983
There's nothing selfish
about liking someone.

387
00:16:10,275 --> 00:16:11,358
I also don't understand why

388
00:16:11,442 --> 00:16:13,483
you're so worried
about causing trouble.

389
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,733
Thing is,

390
00:16:14,817 --> 00:16:16,233
we're always gonna
cause problems for others,

391
00:16:16,317 --> 00:16:17,817
and they'll cause
problems for us.

392
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,525
There's no getting around that.

393
00:16:19,608 --> 00:16:20,358
[HIRO]
So...

394
00:16:20,442 --> 00:16:21,942
What exactly are you saying?

395
00:16:22,025 --> 00:16:25,317
Nothing special, you know me,
I just say what's on my mind.

396
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,942
If a club up and fails
because another member

397
00:16:27,025 --> 00:16:28,775
has a crush on someone else,

398
00:16:28,858 --> 00:16:32,150
then it only speaks
to the level of that club.

399
00:16:32,233 --> 00:16:33,608
If you ask me,

400
00:16:33,692 --> 00:16:36,358
you should turn your
feelings into power.

401
00:16:38,317 --> 00:16:40,108
[HIRO]
Turn them into power?

402
00:16:40,192 --> 00:16:42,567
Is it really okay to do that?

403
00:16:57,525 --> 00:16:59,608
[SANE]
Done putting the kotos away!

404
00:16:59,692 --> 00:17:02,358
[KOTA] Do you think Hiro and
Mister Takinami are coming back?

405
00:17:02,442 --> 00:17:03,692
Maybe.

406
00:17:03,775 --> 00:17:05,067
He said he wanted to talk to us

407
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:07,067
about the piece
for the qualifier.

408
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:08,900
[MITTSU] Well then, we should
go check out the food stalls

409
00:17:08,983 --> 00:17:10,650
while we still have the chance.

410
00:17:10,733 --> 00:17:12,025
All right!

411
00:17:12,108 --> 00:17:14,233
You guys go, I'll wait here
for them to get back.

412
00:17:14,317 --> 00:17:17,192
[SANE] Don't worry, we'll bring
you back something delicious!

413
00:17:17,275 --> 00:17:18,608
[SATOWA]
Thanks a lot.

414
00:17:18,692 --> 00:17:20,025
[SANE]
Come on, Chika!

415
00:17:20,108 --> 00:17:23,150
I'm not super hungry,
so I'll wait here with Hozuki.

416
00:17:24,233 --> 00:17:26,317
[SANE] You gotta eat,
you're a growing boy!

417
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,733
[CHIKA]
What are you, my mom?

418
00:17:27,817 --> 00:17:28,650
Just go.

419
00:17:28,733 --> 00:17:30,567
[SATOWA]
Oh no. What should I do?

420
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:32,525
Actually, I think
I'll go with them.

421
00:17:32,608 --> 00:17:34,275
Hozuki.

422
00:17:34,358 --> 00:17:35,650
Wait.

423
00:17:35,733 --> 00:17:37,358
Yes?

424
00:17:37,442 --> 00:17:39,233
Um...

425
00:17:44,525 --> 00:17:46,150
Tell me.

426
00:17:46,233 --> 00:17:49,442
I want to make things right
again, just tell me what to do.

427
00:17:50,358 --> 00:17:52,233
Look Hozuki, the last thing
I'd ever wanna do

428
00:17:52,317 --> 00:17:53,817
is make you uncomfortable!

429
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:56,108
Agh! I've wanted to apologize,
but you keep avoiding me.

430
00:17:56,192 --> 00:17:58,025
I don't know what to say!

431
00:17:58,108 --> 00:17:59,275
So, um...

432
00:17:59,358 --> 00:18:00,650
For what it's worth to ya,

433
00:18:00,733 --> 00:18:02,775
I'm truly sorry.

434
00:18:02,858 --> 00:18:04,567
Oh. I...

435
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:05,692
Yo, Chika!

436
00:18:05,775 --> 00:18:08,400
We ran into Mister Takinami!

437
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:12,817
Wait, wait, wait!

438
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,192
Why'd you close the door?

439
00:18:14,275 --> 00:18:15,233
'Cause.

440
00:18:15,317 --> 00:18:17,483
I didn't want to
interrupt your talk.

441
00:18:17,567 --> 00:18:21,150
It's too late, bcause you're
here about the piece, right?

442
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:23,025
About the shortlist you gave me.

443
00:18:23,108 --> 00:18:25,067
Oh, did you listen to them?

444
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:27,192
I was thinking about
choosing one of those.

445
00:18:27,275 --> 00:18:30,150
[TAKINAMI] None of them sounded
right, so that's a hard no.

446
00:18:30,233 --> 00:18:31,358
Hozuki.

447
00:18:31,442 --> 00:18:33,192
Bring in all the koto
recordings you have.

448
00:18:33,275 --> 00:18:34,942
We need more options.

449
00:18:35,025 --> 00:18:36,025
[SATOWA]
Okay.

450
00:18:36,108 --> 00:18:38,567
But what specifically
was the problem?

451
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:41,400
None of those pieces
will take you to nationals.

452
00:18:41,483 --> 00:18:42,483
That was all.

453
00:18:42,567 --> 00:18:44,025
[SATOWA]
But, as far as difficulty goes,

454
00:18:44,108 --> 00:18:45,817
any of them would be more
than good enough.

455
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:48,150
Well, it's not a
matter of difficulty.

456
00:18:48,233 --> 00:18:50,192
Play this song
for the time being.

457
00:18:50,275 --> 00:18:52,608
We'll just have to keep
looking for another piece.

458
00:18:52,692 --> 00:18:54,025
It's for hand movements.

459
00:18:54,108 --> 00:18:54,900
Sorry.

460
00:18:54,983 --> 00:18:56,692
I'm sure it'll be really boring.

461
00:18:56,775 --> 00:18:59,025
Tell Kurata and Kurusu about it.

462
00:18:59,108 --> 00:19:01,233
The next qualifier
will be the last chance

463
00:19:01,317 --> 00:19:05,192
for them to make
it to nationals.

464
00:19:05,275 --> 00:19:06,525
[ALL]
Huh?

465
00:19:06,608 --> 00:19:07,858
[CHIKA]
What're you talking about?

466
00:19:07,942 --> 00:19:08,942
They're second years.

467
00:19:09,025 --> 00:19:10,858
Why is it gonna be
their last chance?

468
00:19:10,942 --> 00:19:11,983
Hold on.

469
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:14,150
So you guys don't
know how that works?

470
00:19:14,233 --> 00:19:16,858
The qualifier takes place
either in the fall or winter,

471
00:19:16,942 --> 00:19:18,317
and the actual
nationals take place

472
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,608
in the summer of
the following year.

473
00:19:20,692 --> 00:19:23,567
Even if they get past
the qualifier as third years,

474
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:25,317
they can't go to nationals
because the two of them

475
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,442
will have already
graduated by then.

476
00:19:28,525 --> 00:19:30,233
If you lose in
the next qualifier,

477
00:19:30,317 --> 00:19:33,483
then Kurusu and Kurata won't
ever make it to nationals.

478
00:19:33,567 --> 00:19:36,650
To them, this is
their last opportunity.

479
00:19:37,733 --> 00:19:40,483
[TAKEZO] I'm really glad
you came today, thank you.

480
00:19:40,567 --> 00:19:42,650
[MASHIRO] Whatever,
the pleasure was all mine!

481
00:19:42,733 --> 00:19:44,733
So, are you guys
entering the qualifiers?

482
00:19:44,817 --> 00:19:45,858
We are.

483
00:19:45,942 --> 00:19:47,817
You've got a really
strong koto club.

484
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:50,358
The nationals don't feel
like such a pipe dream.

485
00:19:50,442 --> 00:19:53,358
You're closer than
we were, that's for sure.

486
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:54,442
Maybe.

487
00:19:54,525 --> 00:19:56,025
Even though you
were all third years,

488
00:19:56,108 --> 00:19:59,567
you aimed for nationals for my
sake, and that made me happy.

489
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:01,108
If we had passed that round,

490
00:20:01,192 --> 00:20:02,608
it's not like any of you
could have gone over

491
00:20:02,692 --> 00:20:06,025
to nationals with me,
but you tried anyway.

492
00:20:06,108 --> 00:20:07,858
I think it would have been
cooler if we'd actually managed

493
00:20:07,942 --> 00:20:11,150
to get the tickets to the
competition before we left.

494
00:20:11,233 --> 00:20:12,400
Well, for what it's worth,

495
00:20:12,483 --> 00:20:15,108
the fact that you tried
was still pretty cool.

496
00:20:17,108 --> 00:20:18,775
[CHIKA]
Their last chance?

497
00:20:18,858 --> 00:20:20,775
Then if we fail, it's over.

498
00:20:20,858 --> 00:20:22,942
They're done competing.

499
00:20:23,025 --> 00:20:23,983
No way!

500
00:20:25,525 --> 00:20:26,900
[TAKEZO] Oh yeah,
one of the first years is

501
00:20:26,983 --> 00:20:29,108
an exceptionally skilled player.

502
00:20:29,192 --> 00:20:31,067
Then you need to practice.

503
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:33,025
All the first years
practice really hard,

504
00:20:33,108 --> 00:20:35,900
and Kurusu improves
more and more every day.

505
00:20:35,983 --> 00:20:37,900
Everybody's doing their best.

506
00:20:37,983 --> 00:20:40,025
[TAKINAMI] If you don't want it
to be the last one for them,

507
00:20:40,108 --> 00:20:43,192
then you'd better practice like
crazy for the next two months.

508
00:20:43,275 --> 00:20:46,233
[TAKEZO] So I don't want the
next competition to be our last.

509
00:20:46,317 --> 00:20:48,317
Be efficient and work hard.

510
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,400
Push yourselves.

511
00:20:49,483 --> 00:20:51,192
Practice so much
that you know for a fact

512
00:20:51,275 --> 00:20:53,192
no one tried harder than you.

513
00:20:53,275 --> 00:20:55,942
Even with all that,
it will still be difficult.

514
00:20:56,025 --> 00:20:58,317
[TAKEZO]
Together.

515
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,400
We'll fight!

516
00:20:59,483 --> 00:21:01,317
Until the very end.

517
00:21:03,233 --> 00:21:04,608
[MASHIRO]
Good luck!

518
00:21:04,692 --> 00:21:05,692
Hey!

519
00:21:06,317 --> 00:21:08,858
[KOTA]
Chika.

520
00:21:15,317 --> 00:21:18,192
[sighs]
Hozuki.

521
00:21:18,275 --> 00:21:20,233
Actually, don't bring in
the pieces you have.

522
00:21:20,317 --> 00:21:22,108
Huh? Why not?

523
00:21:22,192 --> 00:21:23,108
I'll drive.

524
00:21:23,192 --> 00:21:25,067
I'd prefer to get
them right now.

525
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:27,567
It's a festival, missing
a few hours won't hurt.

526
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:29,442
If you say so,
and I would like to know

527
00:21:29,525 --> 00:21:32,483
which piece we're going
to play as soon as possible.

528
00:21:32,567 --> 00:21:35,525
Here, Kudo, this practice piece
uses the hirajoshi scale,

529
00:21:35,608 --> 00:21:37,317
so you'll need the tuner.

530
00:21:40,025 --> 00:21:41,400
[CHIKA]
Thanks.

531
00:21:46,525 --> 00:21:48,233
[SATOWA, CHIKA]
Their last chance.

532
00:23:22,233 --> 00:23:23,025
Damn.

533
00:23:23,108 --> 00:23:24,817
None of these really stand out.

534
00:23:33,192 --> 00:23:34,858
[TAKANAMI]
I found it.

535
00:23:51,858 --> 00:23:53,983
[SATOWA]
Next time: "Reunion."
