1
00:01:49,151 --> 00:01:52,362
Yeah. I had a pretty hard
time facing Chika back then.

2
00:01:52,404 --> 00:01:54,990
At least he was able
to pick himself up.

3
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:57,284
I think it's kind of awesome
that he's so focused

4
00:01:57,326 --> 00:01:59,870
on understanding the koto
and protecting the club

5
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:01,955
that his grandfather started.

6
00:02:01,997 --> 00:02:04,916
And while I'm sure we're not
all that much help to Chika,

7
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:07,461
we want to at least try
and be there for him.

8
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:08,045
Oops.

9
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:10,380
Uh. Sorry if I was rambling.

10
00:02:10,422 --> 00:02:13,091
Can you please keep
this just between us?

11
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:15,636
Hey. Wait! Hozuki!

12
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:17,012
[SATOWA]
No way.

13
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:18,722
[KOTA] The group of
guys he used to hang with

14
00:02:18,764 --> 00:02:20,307
smashed up his
grandfather's house

15
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:21,975
and the instruments he made,

16
00:02:22,017 --> 00:02:24,394
and then they pinned
it all on Chika.

17
00:02:24,436 --> 00:02:27,105
Everyone pretty much
hated him after that,

18
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,816
and then his grandpa
died a few days later.

19
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:31,902
And even though none
of it was his fault,

20
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:36,198
Chika still decided to take
responsibility for everything.

21
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,658
[SATOWA] Anyone who
would damage the instruments

22
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:40,744
doesn't have what it
takes to play the koto.

23
00:02:40,786 --> 00:02:42,496
What should I do?

24
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:43,789
If we are forced to disband

25
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,541
because we can't get new
members, it'll be your fault!

26
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,335
What should I do?

27
00:02:48,377 --> 00:02:49,920
Back off, a Neanderthal like you

28
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:52,464
would probably just
end up damaging it!

29
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:54,758
What should I do?

30
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,552
And who's fault is it that
we have to perform at all?

31
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:02,265
Hey, watch where you're going!

32
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:03,225
[gasps]

33
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:04,976
Whoa. Why are you crying?

34
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:07,437
I'm not; it's just
seasonal allergies!

35
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:09,481
Whatever makes you feel better.

36
00:03:16,655 --> 00:03:19,950
If you want, I'll tell Specs
that you're runnin' a bit late.

37
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:25,122
[NISHINA] He wanted
to "earn what it takes."

38
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:26,832
[CHIKA]
I'll use them well.

39
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:29,292
Look, if you can't do it,
then you should just say so.

40
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:32,796
And if you don't know something,
then you should tell us, okay?

41
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:39,970
[SATOWA]
Sorry!

42
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:41,888
Um.

43
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,433
I heard all about
your grandfather.

44
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:46,935
About his shop and everything.

45
00:03:46,977 --> 00:03:49,604
I said so many horrible things

46
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:53,817
and without even knowing
why you joined the koto club.

47
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:55,819
I'm sorry.

48
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:00,532
You're kinda scary
when you're nice, you know?

49
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:01,199
What?

50
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,660
I'm trying to be serious!

51
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,083
Oh, now, I get it.

52
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:11,960
Is that what you've been
out here crying about?

53
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:15,380
I guess even mean little
Satowa can be cute sometimes!

54
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:17,966
[SATOWA]
You're so annoying!

55
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:20,510
Don't be late to club, Kudo!

56
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:23,472
And sounds never lie.

57
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:26,933
They always reveal
a person's true nature.

58
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:28,351
His sound.

59
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:29,853
It's...

60
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:33,482
The koto club
will be performing?

61
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:34,274
Really?

62
00:04:34,316 --> 00:04:37,652
Yes, at the school's morning
assembly, the week after next.

63
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:41,114
We must ascertain whether or not
these kids are actually serious.

64
00:04:41,156 --> 00:04:42,908
We'll see their true colors.

65
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,242
And, if that's not the case,

66
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:46,203
we can drive Kudo
out of this school,

67
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:48,830
along with his fellow
delinquent club members.

68
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:51,500
Takinami, you're the
koto club advisor.

69
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:54,044
Are you opposed to any of this?

70
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:56,797
I'm not.
So feel free to proceed.

71
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:58,840
[SATOWA]
Stop!

72
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:01,676
Try playing that part with
a more focused sound.

73
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:02,427
What?

74
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:05,639
Would it sound focused if my
fingers had tougher callouses?

75
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,891
[SATOWA]
That's not what I meant.

76
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:11,478
Is there any way you can play
it like you did the other day?

77
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,729
[CHIKA]
What are you talking about?

78
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:14,397
Don't you remember
the other day,

79
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:16,775
when you were practicing by
yourself at the music store?

80
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:18,568
[CHIKA]
No, of course not!

81
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:19,861
You're so useless!

82
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:20,529
What?

83
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:21,279
Whoa!

84
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,114
I definitely understand
what you're trying to say.

85
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,533
Maybe a little gentler though?

86
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:27,160
Playing a focused sound at will
can be difficult for a beginner.

87
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:28,119
I suppose.

88
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:28,954
I should have known better

89
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,914
than to expect great
things from Kudo.

90
00:05:30,956 --> 00:05:32,165
[CHIKA growls]
That's it!

91
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:33,834
Girl or not, you're dead!

92
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:36,086
Uh. That might have
been a little too far.

93
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:52,269
Ah! We made it to the
end without stopping

94
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,520
for the first time!

95
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:54,980
[SANE, MITTSU]
All right!

96
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:55,856
We got it.

97
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:57,274
I think we can do this!

98
00:05:57,315 --> 00:06:00,569
Well, unfortunately, this is
the bare minimum of standards.

99
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:01,987
Can't you ever just be happy?

100
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,947
We've worked hard for this.

101
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:05,156
The audience expects for us

102
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:06,867
to be able to play the
song without stopping,

103
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:08,535
so it's not an accomplishment.

104
00:06:08,577 --> 00:06:09,411
Come on, now.

105
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:11,037
This is a really big deal.

106
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,289
For us, anyway.

107
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,582
[SHIZU]
I've made some tea.

108
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:15,625
Why don't you kids take a break?

109
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:21,339
So, how bout it, Granny?

110
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,508
What did you think
of our performance?

111
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:24,843
Ah well, if it were a test,

112
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:26,803
I suppose you would
have squeaked by.

113
00:06:26,845 --> 00:06:28,638
Uh, what the heck
does that even mean?

114
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,181
It's not meant to be an insult,

115
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,058
but you want to
satisfy your whole school

116
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,019
with this performance, right?

117
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,730
Moving people's hearts through
music is not something

118
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:38,356
that's easy to accomplish.

119
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:40,442
You're all practicing very well.

120
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:42,652
And you have
the technique down.

121
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:44,070
Your sound is strong.

122
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:46,573
So, the next step is learning
how to put your feelings

123
00:06:46,615 --> 00:06:47,616
into your playing.

124
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:48,533
Our feelings?

125
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,618
How do you mean?

126
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:50,577
[SHIZU]
Well.

127
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:52,454
Why are you playing the koto?

128
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:54,956
Who do you want
your music to reach?

129
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:56,499
Just being conscious
of those thoughts

130
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,919
can change your tone completely.

131
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,671
Try playing your song as if
you're letting out the words

132
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:04,132
that you want to
tell your loved ones.

133
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:07,260
After all, sound is just
another language for those

134
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:10,180
who can't communicate
their feelings very well.

135
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:12,515
And that's why it's
perfect for a group of kids

136
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:15,268
who are as misunderstood as you.

137
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:31,034
[SANE]
Yo, Chika!

standing out here for?

It's too early
for all your nonsense!

set up our instruments for us?

That's enough, dude.

You can't go around hugging
whoever ya want, got it?

147
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:50,470
I don't see why
it's such a problem.

148
00:07:50,512 --> 00:07:53,348
We're all friends in the
same club, aren't we?

149
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:54,724
Oh?

00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,144
[SATOWA]
Good morning.

153
00:07:58,186 --> 00:07:59,813
We just got here
a few minutes ago.

154
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:01,731
Look! Everything's
already set up!

155

[SANE]
Hozuki actually did it for us.

156
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,027
[CHIKA]
Let's start practicing.

157
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,906
[TAKEZO] All these
people in the koto club

158
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:13,368
probably joined
for different reasons.

159
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:17,580
But I'm sure we all play
for the same reason.

160
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:19,457
All right, it's that time.

161
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:20,125
