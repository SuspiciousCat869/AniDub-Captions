1
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,268
[TAKEZO] We're almost
done with all the repairs.

2
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:21,188
Soon we can get back
to normal club stuff!

3
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:22,606
[SATOWA] Even with
the instruments back,

4
00:00:22,648 --> 00:00:24,316
if we don't get two more
members within the month,

5
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:26,527
we'll be disbanded, and
thanks to a certain someone,

6
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:28,820
whose name starts with a
"K" and ends with an "Udo,"

7
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:30,572
we haven't had any prospects.

8
00:00:30,614 --> 00:00:31,949
[CHIKA]
How is that my fault?

9
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:33,075
Well, for starters,

10
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:35,744
you have a reputation for
being a no‐good delinquent.

11
00:00:35,786 --> 00:00:38,664
If there were any potential
members interested in the club.

12
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:40,707
You probably scared
them all away.

13
00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:42,376
If that's the case,
Miss Holier Than Thou,

14
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:44,461
why don't you invite some
of your girlfriends to join?

15
00:00:44,503 --> 00:00:46,171
Oh, wait a sec,
that's not an option, is it?

16
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:47,714
'Cuz ya got no friends!

17
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:48,632
Very funny.

18
00:00:48,674 --> 00:00:50,676
I don't have any friends because
I've yet to meet someone

19
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:53,512
my age who's on my level,
so get off my back.

20
00:00:53,554 --> 00:00:55,347
Regardless!
If we're forced to disband

21
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:57,891
because we can't get new
members, it'll be your fault.

22
00:00:57,933 --> 00:00:59,226
Huh?

23
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:34,863
Man. If people are afraid
to join 'cause of me,

24
00:02:34,905 --> 00:02:37,658
then we're better off
without 'em, in my opinion.

25
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:40,035
Chika! Hey, buddy!

26
00:02:40,077 --> 00:02:42,621
[CHIKA yells]
Get off, Kota!

27
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:44,331
What's up, Testuki? Chika?

28
00:02:44,373 --> 00:02:45,707
[TETSUKI]
Sane! Mittsu!

29
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:47,042
It's been a while, Chika.

30
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:49,461
We heard a rumor that
you joined the Koto Club.

31
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:51,546
Following in your
late grandpa's footsteps.

32
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:53,298
That's fairy tale stuff, man!

33
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,510
Stop it, you guys
are so annoying!

34
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:57,386
Crap.

35
00:02:57,427 --> 00:03:01,139
Whoa! Gorgeous! Who's she?

36
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,016
Good afternoon, Kudo!

37
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:06,812
Are these handsome boys
friends of yours, perhaps?

38
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:09,106
[ALL 3] Yes! We are
Kudo's handsome friends!

39
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:10,107
Well, hello!

40
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:13,151
My name's Satowa Hozuki;
I'm in the Koto Club, too.

41
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:13,860
[MITTSU]
Hi there!

42
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:15,153
Hey! Watch out, guys!

43
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,905
That's actually a wolf
in sheep's clothing,

44
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:18,532
and she'll eat you!

45
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:21,535
You shouldn't say mean things
about such a delicate flower.

46
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:22,953
It's rude, man.

47
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:26,415
I'm so jealous you get to be in
the same club as this cute girl.

48
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:29,084
Heck, maybe I should
join the Koto Club too.

49
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:30,502
[SATOWA]
Oh! You should!

50
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:31,169
Huh?

51
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,296
We're actually short
a few members.

52
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:36,675
If nothing changes soon, I'm
afraid we'll have to disband.

53
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:37,592
Plus,

54
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:40,595
it'd be great to have a couple
more handsome guys in the club.

55
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:42,889
It would make me so happy.

56
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:44,391
We'll all join!

57
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:45,517
You guys are crazy!

58
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:48,270
Please refer to us as
the Koto Club's saviors!

59
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:49,396
What the hell is your problem?

60
00:03:49,438 --> 00:03:51,940
Those idiots are actually
considering joining us!

61
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:52,691
Now what?

62
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:55,068
Relax, they don't even
have to play the koto.

63
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:57,821
All I need from those
three morons are their names.

64
00:03:57,863 --> 00:03:59,322
Once they're listed
on our club roster,

65
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:01,408
we lose the risk
of being disbanded.

66
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:03,076
[CHIKA]
Evil.

67
00:04:03,118 --> 00:04:03,952
You know,

68
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:06,705
these stunts are the reason
why you don't have any friends.

69
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:09,166
It doesn't really matter.

70
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:12,169
After all, I'm used
to being by myself.

71
00:04:14,296 --> 00:04:15,756
[SANE]
And there you have it!

72
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:17,632
We are the Koto club's Saviors:.

73
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:18,925
Saneyasu Adachi.

00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:20,135
Michitaka Sakai.

75
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:22,262
And Kota Mizuhara!

76
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:25,390
[TAKEZO]
Our saviors?

77
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:27,392
Someone want to
tell me what's going on?

78
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:30,562
[CHIKA] Don't worry, I'm sure
they'll get bored and leave.

79
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,401
Damn those reprobates.

80
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:38,320
[SANE]
Whoa, awesome!

81
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:39,821
There're so many!

82
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:42,491
Perfect, the noisy
one multiplied.

83
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:44,326
Here, plectrums and their bands.

84
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:45,869
Find some that fit.

85
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:47,078
[TAKEZO]
Hozuki?

86
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,332
Would you mind picking
some plectrums out for Kudo?

87
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:51,833
Why can't you do it?

88
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:54,503
Because I should
help with damage control...

89
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:56,379
...for their sake.

90
00:04:57,589 --> 00:04:59,424
Give me your hand.

91
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:07,808
[CHIKA]
So, hey,

92
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:10,268
I don't really know
much about koto schools.

93
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,355
But I guess that would mean your
folks probably play, too, huh?

94
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:14,815
Yes, what of it?

95
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:16,316
Nothing really.

96
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:17,442
I was just wondering

97
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:19,903
if you learned how to
play from your parents.

98
00:05:19,945 --> 00:05:22,072
That's not something
you need to know.

99
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:23,657
Huh?!

100
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,535
[CHIKA] What's with
this girl's finger tips?

101
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:28,787
They're hard as rocks.

102
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:30,747
Whoa.

103
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:32,582
My own plectrums.

104
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:35,460
Are you sure we only need three
of these plectrum thingies?

105
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:36,127
[TAKEZO]
Yep.

106
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,838
You use your
fingers for the rest.

107
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,339
[SHIZU]
Is everyone finished?

108
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:40,215
Oh, yes, ma'am.

109
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:43,093
In that case,
that's 5,000 yen each.

110
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:44,219
What? For real?

111
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:45,720
We have to pay for this crap?

112
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:49,224
[TAKEZO] Shoot. I didn't
think about this part.

113
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:51,560
[CHIKA]
Look, I can bring more tomorrow.

114
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:52,686
But for right now,

115
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:54,521
will this do?

116
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,899
And do you have a way
of getting more money?

117
00:05:57,941 --> 00:05:59,442
[CHIKA]
I'll figure it out.

118
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:01,820
Good 'cuz it's not like I have
a money tree out back.

119
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:03,238
You gotta pay.

120
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,906
[CHIKA]
Then...

121
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:07,576
Once I've saved up enough,
I'll come back for them.

122
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:08,743
[TAKEZO]
I'm sorry, Kudo.

123
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:10,036
I didn't really think ahead.

124
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:11,872
[CHIKA]
Yeah, obviously!

125
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:13,582
Huh?

126
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:16,126
I suppose you did
help us repair the kotos.

127
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:17,752
Since it was a
fair amount of work,

128
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:20,505
I'll consider that your payment.

129
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:23,174
So then, uh, what about us?

130
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:24,968
[SHIZU] You think I'm dumb
enough to give away equipment

131
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:27,220
to freeloaders who
don't even want to play?

132
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:28,889
Probably not.

133
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:36,187
I'll use them well.

134
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,732
[SHIZU]
Hmm...

135
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:41,985
I know, that's why
I'm giving them to you.

136
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:46,740
[TETSUKI]
So, how were the guys yesterday?

137
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:47,949
Useless, of course.

138
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:49,326
And they bailed early.

139
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:50,785
Ah, so the usual?

140
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:53,872
There's no way they're gonna
stick with the club, y'know?

141
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:57,167
Plus, those guys never
commit to any... thing...

142
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:59,127
Hey, man! Why're ya late?

143
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:00,879
Do you know how
to play the koto?

144
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:02,213
Why are you guys even here?

145
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:04,382
Nah. Old instruments
aren't really our thing.

146
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:07,093
But hey, you can still enter
competitions without us, right?

147
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:09,387
Now that our names on the
roster, your club is safe!

148
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,723
Yay! We're such geniuses!

149
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:12,891
Yeah, sure.

150
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:16,686
I can't believe they actually
fell for that banshee's trap!

151
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:19,105
I got ya! Hah! I win again!

152
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:20,732
[CHIKA]
Cut it out, idiots!

153
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:23,234
If you're gonna roughhouse,
do it somewhere else!

154
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:29,449
[VICE‐PRINCIPAL]
Well, just as I thought.

155
00:07:29,491 --> 00:07:31,826
I suspected this
might be a ruse.

156
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:33,536
Uh, Vice‐Principal, sir!

157
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:34,287
[CHIKA]
Crap.

158
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:35,413
Much like this card,

159
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,123
this club is nothing

I told you guys!

266
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:56,507
[SATOWA] Let's start with a
basic explanation of the koto.

267
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:59,177
A typical koto has 13 strings.

268
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:02,430
When played, there are moveable
bridges underneath the strings.

269
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:04,933
Which are tuned to the
sounds needed for each piece.

270
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:07,769
Music is written in
traditional koto notation,

271
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:10,688
or in staff notation, like you
might see with the piano.

272
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:11,606
That's it.

273
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:14,400
Here, now play this simple
piece called, "Sakura, Sakura."

I disagree.

277
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:20,448
Actually playing a song
will help you learn faster

278
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:21,866
than if I just lectured you,

279
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:24,452
Or maybe you're
afraid you can't do it?

00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:59,323
But not Kudo.

475
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:01,117
He's another story all together.

476
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:02,284
He won't quit.

477
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:08,207
Anyone would want to quit
after the way I acted yesterday.

478
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:13,963
[BOY] Why the heck are you so
serious all the time, Satowa?

479
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:16,173
All we wanna do is have fun.

480
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:19,009
But you act like
playing is life or death.

481
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:20,845
[GIRL]
I can't keep up with you.

482
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,763
Just play by yourself.

483
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:26,434
[SANE]
What's up, Chika?

484
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:27,935
What'd you wanna see us about?

485
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:29,228
[CHIKA]
Took you long enough.

486
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,479
I have something to give you.

487
00:20:30,521 --> 00:20:33,190
I made 'em myself,
so you'd better use 'em!

488
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:33,899
Got it?

489
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:35,609
[ALL 3 laugh]

490
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:36,986
What the hell are
you laughing at?

491
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:38,946
For real?
You actually made these?

492
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:39,655
Why, Chika?

493
00:20:39,697 --> 00:20:40,990
Huh? It's because I wanna make

494
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:44,660
that bossy snob speechless
for once, obviously!

495
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:45,411
[SATOWA]
What's this?

496
00:20:45,453 --> 00:20:48,080
Is he planning some kind
of mean‐spirited prank?

497
00:20:48,122 --> 00:20:49,498
Typical delinquent.

498
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,751
Okay, buddy.
Don't worry, we got you.

499
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:53,419
For sure,
by the time we're done,

500
00:20:53,461 --> 00:20:54,795
she won't even know what to say!

501
00:20:54,837 --> 00:20:55,838
See ya!

502
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,716
[CHIKA growls]

503
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:01,761
[SATOWA] Just as I thought,
he's pathetic.

504
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:03,596
[gasps]

505
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:13,147
[SATOWA]
Wait. What was that?

506
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:16,025
It looked like a
koto made of cardboard?

507
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:17,610
[CHIKA]
Let's see.

508
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:19,111
Five.

509
00:21:19,153 --> 00:21:20,571
Five, and...

510
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:24,492
[SATOWA chuckles lightly]

511
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:29,497
[TAKEZO]
Not Kudo.

512
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:31,248
He's another story all together.

513
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,042
He won't quit.

514
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:35,419
The next one.
Let's see now. Six?

515
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:36,670
You know, It's better

516
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:39,089
if you don't write the names
of the strings on the side.

517
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:40,299
You saw?

518
00:21:40,341 --> 00:21:41,383
[SATOWA]
If you have them there,

519
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:44,970
then you'll get into the
habit of relying on them.

520
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:47,765
Then again, in your case, you'll
probably need the whole month

521
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:49,892
just to memorize
which strings are which.

522
00:21:49,934 --> 00:21:51,435
Hey!

523
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:53,270
[SATOWA]
Although,

524
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:55,147
I'll give you this much.

525
00:21:55,189 --> 00:21:59,151
The form on the hand that you
use to play is actually perfect.

526
00:21:59,193 --> 00:22:02,029
You must have had
an excellent teacher.

527
00:22:02,071 --> 00:22:03,614
[gasps]

528
00:23:57,102 --> 00:24:00,189
[SATOWA] Next time:
"The First Resounding Note."
