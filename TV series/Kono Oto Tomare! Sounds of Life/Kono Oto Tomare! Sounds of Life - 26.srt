[CHIHARU]
Thank goodness.

6
00:00:36,983 --> 00:00:41,275
I was looking for you,
hoping you might still be here.

7
00:00:43,775 --> 00:00:46,233
[CHIHARU]
I heard your performance.

8
00:00:46,317 --> 00:00:48,775
[gasps]

9
00:00:48,858 --> 00:00:50,858
I am so sorry.

10
00:00:50,942 --> 00:00:53,692
When I think about all
the things I've done,

11
00:00:53,775 --> 00:00:56,567
and how those things
can never be undone,

12
00:00:56,650 --> 00:01:00,650
I can only assume that it left
a deep scar on your heart.

13
00:01:00,733 --> 00:01:04,067
You don't have to forgive me.
I don't deserve that.

14
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:05,442
But I want to ask.

15
00:01:05,525 --> 00:01:09,942
If you can maybe see it
in your heart, would you...?

16
00:01:10,025 --> 00:01:12,317
Would you give me
one more chance?

17
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,983
Another chance to
face you? Properly?

18
00:01:17,608 --> 00:01:24,192
So, does that mean my
feelings... finally reached you?

19
00:01:24,275 --> 00:01:29,942
For once. I managed
to get through to you?

20
00:01:30,025 --> 00:01:32,358
You understood me?

you'd do something like that!

My goodness.

31
00:04:08,983 --> 00:04:10,442
I'm so sorry, Hozuki.

32
00:04:10,525 --> 00:04:13,150
We didn't mean to ruin your
reunion with your mom.

33
00:04:13,233 --> 00:04:16,983
[SATOWA] It wasn't ruined.
I guess I'm just embarrassed.

34
00:04:17,067 --> 00:04:18,525
You had to help me look for her.

35
00:04:18,608 --> 00:04:22,400
And then you guys had to
see me crying, so I'm sorry.

36
00:04:22,483 --> 00:04:24,025
Don't apologize!

37
00:04:24,108 --> 00:04:27,608
A beautiful reunion is nothing
to be embarrassed about!

38
00:04:27,692 --> 00:04:31,650
[CHIKA] Hm? You two really
resemble each other.

39
00:04:31,733 --> 00:04:33,025
D'You know that?

40
00:04:33,108 --> 00:04:35,650
Were you one of the boys
playing the bass koto?

41
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:37,650
[CHIKA]
Mm! Yes, I'm Kudo.

42
00:04:37,733 --> 00:04:40,983
Ah. I see. So you're Kudo.

43
00:04:41,067 --> 00:04:42,525
[CHIKA]
Huh?

44
00:04:42,608 --> 00:04:45,233
Well, you and the other boy
played the 17-string quite well.

45
00:04:45,317 --> 00:04:47,067
It was a great performance.

46
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:50,900
I want to thank you... for being
supportive of my daughter.

47
00:04:50,983 --> 00:04:54,483
[gasps]
Oh. I, uh...

48
00:04:54,567 --> 00:04:58,483
But if anything, Hozuki's been
the one leading us, you know?

49
00:04:58,567 --> 00:05:01,775
Leading people and supporting
someone are different things.

50
00:05:01,858 --> 00:05:04,567
I can see why this
club is so important.

51
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:08,983
Why she likes it,
and why she cherishes it.

Yeah, me too!

All this happy reunion
stuff made me thirsty!

to see who buys drinks!

Thank you. I'm glad that
you brought me here today.

63
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:37,400
Oh? Well, I'm sorry that
I was so forceful.

64
00:05:37,483 --> 00:05:39,275

Alright, get ready!

of kids. Just like you said.

00:05:45,817 --> 00:05:47,400
[AKIRA]
They are.

68
00:05:48,442 --> 00:05:52,025
[CHIKA] Man, why do I suck so
hard at rock-paper-scissors?

[CHIKA gasps]

[KAZUSA gasps] What?
Why don't you take a picture?

71
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:00,025
Do you have a problem?

72
00:06:00,108 --> 00:06:01,733
What's with that dumb
look on your face?

73
00:06:01,817 --> 00:06:03,942
[CHIKA] The hell?
Stop yelling at me.

74
00:06:04,025 --> 00:06:06,108
I just came here to get
some drinks, ya nut.

75
00:06:06,192 --> 00:06:07,358
[KAZUSA grunts]

76
00:06:11,192 --> 00:06:14,150
[KAZUSA] Whatever, I bet you
think you were better than us.

77
00:06:14,233 --> 00:06:15,608
[CHIKA]
Huh?

78
00:06:15,692 --> 00:06:18,650
[KAZUSA] Look at you, over here
buying drinks and stuff.

79
00:06:18,733 --> 00:06:22,067
If you're that relaxed you must
think you got first place.

80
00:06:23,525 --> 00:06:26,275
[CHIKA]
You don't think you took first?

81
00:06:26,358 --> 00:06:28,233
[KAZUSA]
I don't know.

82
00:06:28,317 --> 00:06:31,983
I used to believe being in sync
was all that really mattered.

83
00:06:32,067 --> 00:06:35,650
I thought it sounded so
beautiful and perfect.

84
00:06:35,733 --> 00:06:39,692
It's what making music has
always meant to us as a club.

85
00:06:39,775 --> 00:06:45,192
But then... I heard your
group perform together.

86
00:06:45,275 --> 00:06:48,775
So now, all the focus we
spent on just being in sync,

87
00:06:48,858 --> 00:06:51,192
feels kinda dumb.

88
00:06:52,567 --> 00:06:55,108
[CHIKA exhales]
What're you saying?

89
00:06:55,192 --> 00:06:59,317
"Just being in sync"?
Don't belittle it like that.

90
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,567
[KAZUSA gasps]

91
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:01,900
[CHIKA] You guys played
perfectly at that speed,

92
00:07:01,983 --> 00:07:04,525
even with so many
people up there.

93
00:07:04,608 --> 00:07:06,525
It doesn't mean much
coming from me,

94
00:07:06,608 --> 00:07:08,400
but I thought it was awesome.

95
00:07:08,483 --> 00:07:10,983
[gasps]

96
00:07:11,067 --> 00:07:13,650
[CHIKA] You're right, though.
We will take first place.

97
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:14,983
[KAZUSA gasps]

98
00:07:18,942 --> 00:07:22,400
[KAZUSA]
Hey! Hold on just a second!

99
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:24,442
Do you remember when I
said that you weren't worthy

100
00:07:24,525 --> 00:07:26,483
to play the koto with Satowa?

101
00:07:26,567 --> 00:07:30,108
I take it back.
I hate to say it.

102
00:07:30,192 --> 00:07:32,650
I don't even want to admit it.

103
00:07:35,567 --> 00:07:39,567
Your performance today...
was actually really good!

104
00:07:40,567 --> 00:07:43,858

Stupid jerk.

108
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:52,358

say thank you or whatever.

[ANNOUNCER A]
Attention participants:

111
00:07:55,525 --> 00:07:58,942
We will now announce the results
and hold the closing ceremony.

112
00:07:59,025 --> 00:08:00,442
[CHIKA grunts]

113
00:08:00,525 --> 00:08:02,275
[ANNOUNCER A] We request that
the participating schools

114
00:08:02,358 --> 00:08:04,275
return to the hall.

115
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:10,192
[ASAHINA] Now then. Thank you
for your performances today.

116
00:08:10,275 --> 00:08:13,608
To be honest, everyone sounded
amazing this year.

117
00:08:13,692 --> 00:08:15,858
It felt like we were
already at Nationals.

118
00:08:15,942 --> 00:08:18,733
We were all
quite impressed. Truly.

119
00:08:18,817 --> 00:08:20,817
Unfortunately, it left us judges

120
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:23,358
with a rather
difficult decision.

121
00:08:23,442 --> 00:08:25,567
[WADA] Oh, my. We can
only send one of these

122
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:27,817
high schools
to Nationals, right?

123
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:30,025
Himesaka, Hakuto and Tokise.

124
00:08:30,108 --> 00:08:33,233
They're all good enough to
have a shot going forward.

125
00:08:33,317 --> 00:08:35,650
[ASAHINA] I agree, but we
can only choose one.

126
00:08:35,733 --> 00:08:36,858
[gasps]

127
00:08:36,942 --> 00:08:40,358
So in my opinion, it's Tokise.

128
00:08:40,442 --> 00:08:44,108
Their skill level is above
satisfactory, and what's more,

129
00:08:44,192 --> 00:08:46,150
I've never been so
moved by a performance

130
00:08:46,233 --> 00:08:50,817
from high school kids before.
It's very impressive.

131
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:53,025
When I heard those
kids playing,

132
00:08:53,108 --> 00:08:57,067
it made me really remember
how wonderful music can be.

133
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:59,150
I disagree.

134
00:08:59,233 --> 00:09:02,442
A lot of musicians these days
only play modern pieces.

135
00:09:02,525 --> 00:09:04,775
They have beautiful
melodies and simple motifs,

136
00:09:04,858 --> 00:09:07,608
so the music resonates more
easily with the audience.

137
00:09:07,692 --> 00:09:10,442
But, that also means that the
piece isn't that difficult

138
00:09:10,525 --> 00:09:13,358
to play in the grand
scheme of things.

139
00:09:13,442 --> 00:09:15,983
So I would like to
recommend Hakuto.

140
00:09:16,067 --> 00:09:18,608
They should get high marks for
both their selection of piece

141
00:09:18,692 --> 00:09:20,400
and performance.

142
00:09:20,483 --> 00:09:22,358
What do you think,
Mister Wada?

143
00:09:22,442 --> 00:09:25,317
Well, it's a tough choice.
To be honest with you,

144
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,983
I had found Tokise's
performance quite moving.

145
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:30,567
But if I considered all
of the competition,

146
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:32,608
I'd have to say Himesaka.

147
00:09:32,692 --> 00:09:34,650
I think their ability to be
perfectly in sync

148
00:09:34,733 --> 00:09:37,733
is worthy of first place.

149
00:09:37,817 --> 00:09:42,317
[ASAHINA grunts] Do you have
an opinion, Mister Matsunaga?

150
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:45,192
[ASAHINA]
If it were possible,

151
00:09:45,275 --> 00:09:48,150
we would send every single
participant to Nationals.

152
00:09:48,233 --> 00:09:50,733
We sincerely mean that.

153
00:09:50,817 --> 00:09:52,150
However.

154
00:09:52,233 --> 00:09:54,817
If that happened, it would no
longer be a competition.

155
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:57,817
We still had to assign a rank
to all of your performances.

156
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,567
Which was hard.

157
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:02,150
Because no matter what
our personal feelings are,

158
00:10:02,233 --> 00:10:03,442
at the end of the day

159
00:10:03,525 --> 00:10:06,983
we can only send one
school here to Nationals.

160
00:10:07,067 --> 00:10:10,358
Now then, without further ado...

161
00:10:10,442 --> 00:10:14,108
[MATSUNAGA] There is only
one school that qualifies.

162
00:10:14,192 --> 00:10:15,817
They were obviously
in a different league

163
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,858
than the others.

164
00:10:17,942 --> 00:10:20,442
In music and technique.

[ASAHINA gasps]

166
00:10:22,067 --> 00:10:23,150
[MATSUNAGA]
Don't get me wrong,

167
00:10:23,233 --> 00:10:25,608
I understand what
Miss Midoriyama means.

168
00:10:25,692 --> 00:10:27,983
But their excellent performance
didn't come from the fact

169
00:10:28,067 --> 00:10:31,900
that it was simply the kind of
piece that people like to hear.

170
00:10:31,983 --> 00:10:36,150
When a piece is wonderful,
it goes beyond experts.

171
00:10:36,233 --> 00:10:38,483
It's able to reach those who
don't know that much about

172
00:10:38,567 --> 00:10:41,525
the koto and what kind
of music it can make.

173
00:10:41,608 --> 00:10:44,650
Music like that can reach those
who speak a different language

174
00:10:44,733 --> 00:10:48,525
and live in a different culture.
So I think it's only proper

175
00:10:48,608 --> 00:10:51,942
that we shine a light on such
a brilliant performance.

The school that

First! He said first! Right?

Is it true? Did we really win?

We did!

Duh. Of course we were awesome.

00:12:33,608 --> 00:12:36,483
We snatched up that ticket to
Nationals just like you said.

Way to go.

Way to go, tiger.

00:12:49,275 --> 00:12:51,317
I didn't know you were gonna
be here today, Mashiro.

215

I wouldn't miss it!

I just happened to
sit next to Isaki,

217
00:12:54,483 --> 00:12:56,192
so we got to know
each other a bit.

You're actually going
to Nationals.

That's so cool.

That was such an incredible
performance. Congratulations!

Thank you, that means a lot.

223

At least now we can
relax a little.

224
00:13:11,525 --> 00:13:12,942
What do you mean,

225

you've been composed this
entire time, Mister Takinami.

Are you kidding me?

If anything, I've been
a nervous wreck all day.

[AKIRA gasps]

230

[TAKINAMI] If for some reason
they couldn't get to Nationals

231
00:13:24,483 --> 00:13:26,608
with a performance like that,

232
00:13:26,692 --> 00:13:28,858
it would be because of my
arrangement of the piece.

233
00:13:28,942 --> 00:13:31,192
[AKIRA]
What? No.

234
00:13:31,275 --> 00:13:32,900
It's quite possible.

235
00:13:32,983 --> 00:13:34,483
When a piece is
easy to listen to,

236
00:13:34,567 --> 00:13:37,067
then it becomes easy for
people to dismiss it.

it worked out.

I already knew it,

There's not a single reason
for you to be sorry.

Not when you gave such a
wonderful performance up there.

315
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:15,858
[YAMAMOTO]
So, hey, uh, I'm sorry.

316
00:17:15,942 --> 00:17:19,192
Especially since everyone has
been practicing so hard.

317
00:17:19,275 --> 00:17:21,942
But I wasn't good enough.
I let you all down.

318
00:17:22,025 --> 00:17:24,400
Hold on just a sec!
That's enough.

319
00:17:24,483 --> 00:17:26,692
You don't have to
apologize to us.

320
00:17:26,775 --> 00:17:30,400
[gasps] If anything,
we should apologize to you.

321
00:17:30,483 --> 00:17:33,608
We wanted to take you to
Nationals as a farewell gift,

322
00:17:33,692 --> 00:17:35,650
but we couldn't
make that happen.

323
00:17:35,733 --> 00:17:38,150
[YAMAMOTO]
What're you saying? Come on.

324
00:17:38,233 --> 00:17:40,733
You guys played my
piece so wonderfully.

325
00:17:40,817 --> 00:17:44,442
That by itself made
me really happy.

326
00:17:44,525 --> 00:17:47,858
That's why I feel
like I let you down,

327
00:17:47,942 --> 00:17:52,317
because if I was just more of an
expert in music, then maybe--

328
00:17:55,233 --> 00:17:58,442
Hey. Mio?
Wait, why are you crying?

329
00:17:58,525 --> 00:18:03,233
Because... I just
wanted to win today.

330
00:18:03,317 --> 00:18:07,525
I had to win. Because for
Mister Yamamoto, the president,

331
00:18:07,608 --> 00:18:11,108
and the others,
this was their last chance.

332
00:18:11,192 --> 00:18:14,400
If I were better earlier
in the year...

333
00:18:14,483 --> 00:18:16,525
...if I'd improved faster...

334
00:18:16,608 --> 00:18:20,025
...then maybe things
would be different.

335
00:18:20,108 --> 00:18:23,775
Maybe... we'd be
celebrating right now.

336
00:18:26,775 --> 00:18:29,192
[MIO]
I'm sorry.

337
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:31,525
That's not fair of you say.

338
00:18:31,608 --> 00:18:34,233
We're the ones to blame here,
you're only a first year,

339
00:18:34,317 --> 00:18:37,025
it's not your responsibility
to carry us.

340
00:18:37,108 --> 00:18:40,358
How can we apologize to you?

341
00:18:40,442 --> 00:18:42,858
[gasps, grunts]

342
00:18:42,942 --> 00:18:47,150
Stop! No more apologizing!
I need to stop as well!

343
00:18:47,233 --> 00:18:49,567
There's nothing for you
guys to apologize for!

344
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:53,358
It's true! Your performance
today was the best one yet!

345
00:18:53,442 --> 00:18:55,275
I'll be proud of what
I heard up there today

346
00:18:55,358 --> 00:18:57,483
for the rest of my life!

347
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:03,067
Um, the first time I saw
your sheet music...

348
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:07,692
...it looked like a starry sky,
and I thought it was so pretty.

349
00:19:07,775 --> 00:19:09,400
I love the pieces you make.

350
00:19:09,483 --> 00:19:14,900
And... playing them
made me really happy.

351
00:19:14,983 --> 00:19:19,817
[whimpers]

352
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,692
[MIO]
Thank you.

353
00:19:24,858 --> 00:19:26,442
[TAKINAMI]
Time for us to gotta get going.

354
00:19:26,525 --> 00:19:27,567
You guys got everything?

355
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:29,317
[SANE]
Let's roll!

356
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,692
[KAZUSA grunts]

357
00:19:41,108 --> 00:19:43,692
[exhales]
Tokise High School!

358
00:19:43,775 --> 00:19:45,067
[ALL gasp]

359
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:47,108
[FUMI]
Hey. Kazusa?

360
00:19:47,192 --> 00:19:49,608
You guys better win
at Nationals.

361
00:19:49,692 --> 00:19:52,608
I expect nothing less
after beating us.

362
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:55,150
So do whatever you have
to in order to win!

363
00:19:55,233 --> 00:19:57,192
Or I won't forgive you!

364
00:19:57,275 --> 00:19:59,858
Yeah. That's the plan.

365
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:11,275
[CHIKA]
Hmph.

366
00:20:11,358 --> 00:20:13,650
That was a weird way
to root for you guys.

367
00:20:13,733 --> 00:20:15,150
[CHIKA yells]

368
00:20:15,233 --> 00:20:18,525
Congrats on winning. I'm still
upset that we lost, but...

369
00:20:18,608 --> 00:20:21,317
...I wish you luck
at the Nationals.

370
00:20:23,608 --> 00:20:27,483
[TAKEZO] And so, it was with
much joy and heartbreak,

371
00:20:27,567 --> 00:20:31,567
that the Kanagawa Qualifier
finally came to an end.

372
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,483
[gasps]

373
00:21:12,192 --> 00:21:13,858
Hm...

374
00:22:51,442 --> 00:22:54,858
[CHIKA] Aw, dammit!
I messed up again!

375
00:22:54,942 --> 00:22:57,442
Hey. This is a pretty
difficult piece, huh?

376
00:22:57,525 --> 00:22:58,983
Hope we don't screw it up.

377
00:22:59,067 --> 00:23:01,233
Yeah, I know, I'm having trouble
trying to figure out how

378
00:23:01,317 --> 00:23:03,067
my part is supposed to sound.

379
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:05,900
Jeez. You were the ones who
wanted a tougher piece to play.

380
00:23:05,983 --> 00:23:07,317
Do you even remember that?

381
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:11,733
Mister Suzu is such a meanie,
a meanie! I hate him.

382
00:23:11,817 --> 00:23:14,025
Should I ask him to
change the piece, then?

383
00:23:14,108 --> 00:23:15,608
Tell him it's too hard?

384
00:23:15,692 --> 00:23:16,942
[BOYS]
No way!

385
00:23:17,025 --> 00:23:19,983
This is easy! It's a piece
of cake, you hear me?

386
00:23:20,067 --> 00:23:21,442
Good. Well...

387
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:23,983
In the meantime, we can just
practice the other piece.

388
00:23:24,067 --> 00:23:26,983
For the club presentation day.

389
00:23:27,067 --> 00:23:30,733
Yep, I'm super stoked for it!
Are you guys ready?

390
00:23:30,817 --> 00:23:32,275
[ALL]
Yeah!

391
00:23:32,358 --> 00:23:35,942
[TAKEZO] On my count.
One, two...!
