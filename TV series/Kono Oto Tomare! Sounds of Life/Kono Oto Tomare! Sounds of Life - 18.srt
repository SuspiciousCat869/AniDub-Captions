1
00:00:17,608 --> 00:00:20,900
[SATOWA] Mister Takinami?
About the title of the piece.

2
00:00:20,983 --> 00:00:24,317
[TAKINAMI] "A bow in
the heavens". So, "Tenkyu"?

3
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,317
That's right. I originally
thought of the title "Rainbow",

4
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,817
but I was afraid it
was too obvious.

5
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:31,900
Why "Rainbow" specifically?

6
00:00:31,983 --> 00:00:34,483
Well. It often comes
right after the rain stops.

7
00:00:34,567 --> 00:00:36,608
I thought it was kind
of like our smiles.

8
00:00:36,692 --> 00:00:39,233
And of course,
there's seven of us.

9
00:00:40,483 --> 00:00:44,733
[TAKINAMI laughs] A rainbow
with seven colors, huh?

10
00:00:44,817 --> 00:00:46,608
Yeah, real original.

11
00:00:46,692 --> 00:00:48,108
You don't have to laugh at me!

12
00:00:48,192 --> 00:00:51,192
Right, sorry. Look, I think
it's a great title.

13
00:00:51,275 --> 00:00:53,275
It just needs a little tweak.

14
00:00:53,358 --> 00:00:55,275
All I did was change
the character here,

15
00:00:55,358 --> 00:00:57,817
but it still reads as "Tenkyu".

16
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,733
I see. With that change,

17
00:00:59,817 --> 00:01:01,900
"The Heaven's Cry"
would be the new title.

18
00:01:01,983 --> 00:01:03,192
Which sounds sad.

19
00:01:03,275 --> 00:01:06,108
I can see that,
but hear me out.

20
00:01:06,192 --> 00:01:08,817
Tenkyu with "cry" is like
the rain that falls

21
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,733
even when there're no clouds.

22
00:01:10,817 --> 00:01:12,442
It's just my impression,
but to me,

23
00:01:12,525 --> 00:01:15,900
it portrays the rain that
falls from a clear blue sky.

24
00:01:15,983 --> 00:01:17,983
People cry for
different reasons,

25
00:01:18,067 --> 00:01:20,858
it doesn't have to be
limited to sadness.

26
00:01:20,942 --> 00:01:24,108
Alright. It's strange, but in
a way I think you might

27
00:01:24,192 --> 00:01:25,983
understand this piece
better than I do.

28
00:01:26,067 --> 00:01:30,108
Yeah. Maybe. After all,
if I don't understand it,

29
00:01:30,192 --> 00:01:32,400
then I wouldn't be able
to give you guidance.

30
00:01:32,483 --> 00:01:34,233
[chuckles]

31
00:01:36,358 --> 00:01:38,150
[TAKINAMI]
I'm glad the piece has a title.

32
00:01:38,233 --> 00:01:41,525
But, there's still something
else they really need.

33
00:01:41,608 --> 00:01:45,275
Oh, Mister Takinami. Excuse me.
Do you have a minute?

34
00:01:45,358 --> 00:01:46,525
[gasps]

35
00:03:20,108 --> 00:03:22,650
What's this? Oh, are you
sitting behind me now?

36
00:03:22,733 --> 00:03:25,108
Huh? Wait, are you in
front of me, Kurata?

37
00:03:25,192 --> 00:03:27,442
[TAKEZO] I feel bad that
they moved us together.

38
00:03:27,525 --> 00:03:29,067
Counting the club it doesn't
give you much time

39
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:30,067
away from me, huh?

40
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:32,317
It's okay!
If anything, I'm happy!

41
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,317
[TAKEZO]
Uh... um...

42
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,108
[HIRO gasps]
'Cause. You know...!

43
00:03:35,192 --> 00:03:37,650
Uh, this makes it easier
to talk about club stuff!

44
00:03:37,733 --> 00:03:39,692
Yeah. You're right.
That's a good point.

45
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:45,650
[HIRO] Man, that was close.
Good thing he's so dense.

46
00:03:45,733 --> 00:03:47,150
[HIRO gasps]

47
00:03:49,775 --> 00:03:53,567
[HIRO] Wow. Thank you, God!
I'll work hard on club stuff!

48
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,483
I'll work super hard!

49
00:03:56,692 --> 00:04:00,067
[DOJIMA] I'm from Iktah Style;
Koto Hozuki School.

50
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:02,067
Nice to meet you,
I'm Ms. Dojima.

51
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:05,067
Recently it came to my
attention that Satowa Hozuki,

52
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:06,692
the daughter of our grandmaster,

53
00:04:06,775 --> 00:04:09,067
attends the koto club
at this school.

54
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:11,358
Naturally, we would love
to show you our support.

55
00:04:11,442 --> 00:04:13,317
If there's anything at
all we can do to help,

56
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,900
please don't hesitate to ask.

57
00:04:15,983 --> 00:04:19,983
[HIRO] "Tenkyu"? Wow.
That title sounds kinda pretty.

58
00:04:20,067 --> 00:04:23,150
The imagery of it is amazing.

59
00:04:23,233 --> 00:04:24,192
[TAKEZO]
Hello there.

60
00:04:24,275 --> 00:04:25,400
Well, it seems like
we're missing

61
00:04:25,483 --> 00:04:26,858
a couple of club members.

62
00:04:26,942 --> 00:04:30,942
Yeah. Kudo and the others
have cleaning duty... today.

63
00:04:33,233 --> 00:04:35,942
Hello again, Satowa.
Good to see you.

64
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:41,692
Oh. Miss Dojima. It's you.

65
00:04:41,775 --> 00:04:43,442
Do you two know each other?

66
00:04:43,525 --> 00:04:44,775
Yes, you could say that.

67
00:04:44,858 --> 00:04:47,442
I'm Akira Dojima from
the Hozuki school.

68
00:04:47,525 --> 00:04:49,400
It's a pleasure to
meet all of you.

69
00:04:49,483 --> 00:04:50,775
[HIRO, TAKEZO gasp]

70
00:04:50,858 --> 00:04:53,192
Starting today. I'll be giving
you all koto lessons

71
00:04:53,275 --> 00:04:57,275
as your new instructor. I look
forward to working with you.

72
00:04:58,567 --> 00:05:00,525
Huh? Koto lessons?

73
00:05:00,608 --> 00:05:02,233
[HIRO] And she's from
the Hozuki School?

74
00:05:02,317 --> 00:05:03,817
[SATOWA gasps]

75
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,233
[HIRO] Okay spill it,
what's the meaning of all this?

76
00:05:06,317 --> 00:05:08,733
She literally just told you,
what don't you understand?

77
00:05:08,817 --> 00:05:10,567
It's not the what,
it's the why!

78
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:13,650
Move aside, buddy! Today I'll
be the first one there!

79
00:05:13,733 --> 00:05:15,108
Yeah, right!

80
00:05:15,192 --> 00:05:16,358
[CHIKA gasps]

81
00:05:20,983 --> 00:05:24,400
[TAKINAMI grunts]
You total idiots.

82
00:05:24,483 --> 00:05:26,983
So awesome,
we were like dominoes.

83
00:05:27,067 --> 00:05:28,608
What the...?

84
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,358
So, Mister Takinami.

85
00:05:33,442 --> 00:05:35,567
Why are these boys
interrupting the club?

86
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:38,942
[TAKINAMI] Sorry, they can
definitely get a bit rowdy.

87
00:05:39,025 --> 00:05:41,983
They're the other
koto club members.

88
00:05:42,067 --> 00:05:43,733
You're teasing me, aren't you?

89
00:05:43,817 --> 00:05:45,442
Afraid not.

90
00:05:45,525 --> 00:05:47,692
[KOTA] Mister Takinami,
who is this lady?

91
00:05:47,775 --> 00:05:48,900
Starting immediately,

92
00:05:48,983 --> 00:05:51,317
she's going to be your
new koto instructor.

93
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,692
[CHIKA]
Huh?

94
00:05:52,775 --> 00:05:54,400
[HIRO] And get this,
she's from the Hozuki School.

95
00:05:54,483 --> 00:05:55,192
[CHIKA gasps]

96
00:05:55,275 --> 00:05:56,650
I don't understand,

97
00:05:56,733 --> 00:05:59,067
I thought you were going to
guide us, Mister Takinami.

98
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,275
Yes, that's right.
I can guide you.

99
00:06:01,358 --> 00:06:03,317
Well, at least on the
piece as a whole.

100
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,900
But right now the koto club
needs something I can't give,

101
00:06:05,983 --> 00:06:08,150
to improve your technique.

102
00:06:08,233 --> 00:06:10,900
No matter how outstanding
one's musicality is

103
00:06:10,983 --> 00:06:12,900
or how deeply it
can touch people,

104
00:06:12,983 --> 00:06:16,358
if their technique is inferior,
they can't win in a competition.

105
00:06:16,442 --> 00:06:17,983
And while I understand music,

106
00:06:18,067 --> 00:06:20,483
I don't have the ability
to teach you the koto.

107
00:06:20,567 --> 00:06:22,442
Yeah, that's why
we've got Hozuki.

108
00:06:22,525 --> 00:06:24,525
Why can't we keep everything
the way it is?

109
00:06:24,608 --> 00:06:28,650
Hozuki's busy. She needs to
focus on her own practice.

110
00:06:28,733 --> 00:06:30,233
[SATOWA gasps]

111
00:06:30,317 --> 00:06:32,150
[TAKINAMI] Have you ever thought
about how hard it is to teach

112
00:06:32,233 --> 00:06:34,275
others while you're playing?

113
00:06:34,358 --> 00:06:37,192
You lose a lot of your own
practice time that way.

114
00:06:37,275 --> 00:06:40,733
Or maybe you think Hozuki
doesn't need to practice.

115
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,692
Is that it?

116
00:06:42,775 --> 00:06:44,650
Hopefully that
answers everything.

117
00:06:44,733 --> 00:06:46,400
I'll let you practice.

118
00:06:46,483 --> 00:06:49,192
For today I'd like to get to
know your playing abilities,

119
00:06:49,275 --> 00:06:51,983
so I'll just observe you.

120
00:06:52,067 --> 00:06:54,317
[SATOWA] I don't disagree that
it would be better if we had a

121
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,650
koto teacher, but why does
it have to be Miss Dojima?

122
00:06:58,733 --> 00:07:02,067
What do I do if she's trying
to pull something on the club?

123
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:04,358
What if something bad
happens because of me?

124
00:07:04,442 --> 00:07:05,858
[TAKINAMI]
Hozuki.

125
00:07:05,942 --> 00:07:08,275
Look, I don't want you to
worry about anything.

126
00:07:08,358 --> 00:07:12,192
It'll be fine.
Just focus on practicing.

127
00:07:12,275 --> 00:07:13,983
Okay, then.

128
00:07:17,608 --> 00:07:19,775
[TAKINAMI]
Right. Get to it.

129
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:25,567
Okay. Here's the sheet music
for the piece they're doing.

130
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:27,192
Let's take a quick look.

131
00:07:27,275 --> 00:07:29,442
Strange, I've never
heard of this song.

132
00:07:29,525 --> 00:07:31,317
Because it's an
original piece.

133
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,858
Oh, I see. In that case,

134
00:07:33,942 --> 00:07:37,900
I'll need to take the time to
familiarize myself with it.

135
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:39,150
[gasps]

136
00:08:01,567 --> 00:08:02,692
So, what do you think?

137
00:08:02,775 --> 00:08:04,483
Now that you've
watched their practice?

138
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:06,317
Well, to be honest...

139
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,233
...I'm disappointed to
see their skill level

140
00:08:08,317 --> 00:08:09,775
is lower than I expected.

141
00:08:09,858 --> 00:08:11,275
[gasps]

142
00:08:11,358 --> 00:08:13,233
[AKIRA] I'm guessing that
Satowa has been the one

143
00:08:13,317 --> 00:08:15,858
teaching everyone,
but unfortunately her teaching

144
00:08:15,942 --> 00:08:17,358
must have been quite sloppy.

145
00:08:17,442 --> 00:08:18,567
[CHIKA, SATOWA grunt]

146
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:20,150
Those are some pretty
arrogant statements.

147
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:22,025
Do you have the skills
to back them up?

148
00:08:22,108 --> 00:08:23,775
I'm sorry, but what
do you mean, exactly?

149
00:08:23,858 --> 00:08:26,025
Like, are you a better
player than Hozuki?

150
00:08:26,108 --> 00:08:27,900
Teaching the koto and
playing the koto

151
00:08:27,983 --> 00:08:30,400
aren't mutually
exclusive skillsets.

152
00:08:30,483 --> 00:08:33,775
However, Satowa did play
this piece once before

153
00:08:33,858 --> 00:08:35,608
in the National
Koto Competition,

154
00:08:35,692 --> 00:08:38,650
but she was
ultimately disqualified.

155
00:08:38,733 --> 00:08:42,525
And I was the one who won first
place in that same competition.

156
