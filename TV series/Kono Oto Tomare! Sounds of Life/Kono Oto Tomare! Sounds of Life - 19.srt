00:18:12,025 --> 00:18:14,608
[grunts]

311
00:18:14,692 --> 00:18:18,358
Oh, Satowa. Is there
something wrong?

312
00:18:18,442 --> 00:18:20,900
[SATOWA] I listened to it,
your performance of

313
00:18:20,983 --> 00:18:22,817
"Mizu no Hentai."

314
00:18:24,942 --> 00:18:26,567
[SATOWA]
I need to tell you I'm sorry.

315
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:29,817
[AKIRA gasps]
You are? For what?

316
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,233
[SATOWA] Honestly, when you
first came here,

317
00:18:32,317 --> 00:18:33,983
there was a part of me
that was afraid you might

318
00:18:34,067 --> 00:18:35,692
be up to something.

319
00:18:35,775 --> 00:18:38,108
But then, I listened
to your performance,

320
00:18:38,192 --> 00:18:41,400
and after that I couldn't help
but feel ashamed of myself.

321
00:18:41,483 --> 00:18:43,858
[SATOWA] I've never heard
a performance so sincere

322
00:18:43,942 --> 00:18:46,775
towards a piece,
or towards the koto.

323
00:18:46,858 --> 00:18:49,442
So I'm sorry that I
ever doubted you.

324
00:18:49,525 --> 00:18:52,108
[AKIRA]
Please, stop. It's too much.

325
00:18:52,192 --> 00:18:55,150
Stop bowing, already.

326
00:18:55,233 --> 00:18:57,400
And please don't make me
feel any more miserable

327
00:18:57,483 --> 00:18:58,650
than I already do.

328
00:18:58,733 --> 00:19:00,150
[gasps]

329
00:19:02,483 --> 00:19:04,483
H-Hey, wait. Hold on!

330
00:19:04,567 --> 00:19:07,358
[AKIRA] Back then.
Why did you decide to do it?

331
00:19:07,442 --> 00:19:08,525
[SATOWA gasps]

332
00:19:08,608 --> 00:19:10,650
You were good enough
to win first place,

333
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:12,233
but got disqualified.

334
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:15,067
Did you play a different
song on purpose to stand out?

335
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:16,733
--No, I--
--After that competition,

336
00:19:16,817 --> 00:19:19,358
do you know what I
had to deal with?

337
00:19:19,442 --> 00:19:20,983
All I heard was,

338
00:19:21,067 --> 00:19:26,733
"The poor thing, she only won
by default. "Over and over.

339
00:19:26,817 --> 00:19:29,108
I don't want to hear another
word about it from you.

340
00:19:29,192 --> 00:19:31,067
Not ever again.

341
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:41,025
[SATOWA] My mother...
I was trying to get her back.

342
00:19:41,108 --> 00:19:43,733
See, she was under
all kinds of pressure,

343
00:19:43,817 --> 00:19:46,025
and it felt like she was a
different person somehow.

344
00:19:46,108 --> 00:19:47,567
The time around the competition,

345
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:49,608
I felt like I was
invisible to her.

346
00:19:49,692 --> 00:19:52,650
She just couldn't hear me.

347
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:56,525
[SATOWA] And so, I used the
performance to throw a tantrum.

348
00:19:56,608 --> 00:19:58,817
That song was my way
of screaming--no--

349
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:01,025
begging for her attention.

350
00:20:01,108 --> 00:20:03,692
Kinda like... a child.

351
00:20:03,775 --> 00:20:05,900
[gasps]

352
00:20:05,983 --> 00:20:09,233
[SATOWA gasps]
But it didn't work.

353
00:20:09,317 --> 00:20:13,067
In the end, all I did was hurt
her more and mess up the school.

354
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:16,192
You told me that you didn't
think I needed any lessons.

355
00:20:16,275 --> 00:20:17,650
But the fact is,

356
00:20:17,733 --> 00:20:20,692
there are a lot of things
I'd like to learn from you.

357
00:20:20,775 --> 00:20:25,650
That's why I'm here. I came
to ask for your guidance.

358
00:20:25,733 --> 00:20:29,317
[AKIRA] I knew the truth
before she ever told me.

359
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:34,733
That performance was never a
game to her, I knew that much.

360
00:20:34,817 --> 00:20:36,567
Ah, that's right.

361
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:39,442
She's only a first-year
student in high school.

362
00:20:40,817 --> 00:20:44,400
[AKIRA] She's about the same age
as me when our parents died,

363
00:20:44,483 --> 00:20:47,442
and I could do nothing
but lean on Keishi.

364
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,525
[gasps]

365
00:20:55,567 --> 00:20:56,942
[gasps]

366
00:21:00,233 --> 00:21:01,608
[FEMALE VOICE A]
Oh, her long-sought-after

367
00:21:01,692 --> 00:21:03,150
first place has been eclipsed.

368
00:21:03,233 --> 00:21:05,608
Even after all that
time she spent.

369
00:21:05,692 --> 00:21:08,650
She doesn't compare to
her brother. That's for sure.

370
00:21:08,733 --> 00:21:10,400
Poor little thing.

371
00:21:10,483 --> 00:21:14,567
[AKIRA] Where are you going?
Do you want to escape from here?

372
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:17,400
You might be able to
overcome the darkness.

373
00:21:17,483 --> 00:21:20,650
But there's always...

374
00:21:20,733 --> 00:21:22,567
...the endless series of walls

375
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:25,483
that will continue to
stand in your way.

376
00:21:31,775 --> 00:21:33,233
Are you okay?

377
00:21:33,317 --> 00:21:34,775
[AKIRA]
For two years,

378
00:21:34,858 --> 00:21:38,817
I studied "Mizu no Hentai."
But all that work was instantly

379
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:42,067
for nothing the moment you
played your first note.

380
00:21:45,275 --> 00:21:48,358
What could you ever
expect me to teach you?

381
00:21:49,775 --> 00:21:53,733
[AKIRA] It's time... I put
an end to my struggling.

382
00:23:27,483 --> 00:23:30,775
[TAKINAMI]
Mm. Oh, Miss Dojima.

383
00:23:30,858 --> 00:23:33,275
I'm sorry if this seems sudden.

384
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,608
[AKIRA]
But effective immediately,

385
00:23:37,692 --> 00:23:40,275
I can no longer teach
your koto club.

386
00:23:51,567 --> 00:23:54,650
[SATOWA]
Next time: "Another Chance."
