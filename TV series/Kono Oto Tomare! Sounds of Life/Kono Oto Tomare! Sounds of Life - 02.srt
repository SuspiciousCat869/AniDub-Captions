00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:17,667
[PRINCIPAL]
Of course!

316
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:20,044
It's not your fault
that they were broken.

317
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:23,214
Although, that means your club
has only one instrument left.

318
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:25,216
Will that make
practice difficult?

319
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:26,259
[TAKEZO]
Well...

320
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,552
We'll be okay.

321
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:29,804
As it turns out, I have
my own koto at home.

322
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:32,640
So while we wait for them to be
repaired I can practice there.

323
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:33,558
That's fortunate.

324
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:34,392
Yes.

325
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:35,059
Well then,

326
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:37,437
if you run into any problems,
please let me know.

327
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,063
Thank you so much, sir!

328
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:41,107
[TAKEZO]
Back to the nice girl act?

329
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:43,901
[chuckles]

330
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,611
I guess that's the situation.

331
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:47,989
So, do me a favor and let me
know when they're all fixed.

332
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,699
Bye.

333
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:52,952
I wonder if she's mad at me?

334
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:55,037
And Kudo's not here either.

335
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:04,005
[TAKEZO] What do you
mean he's out today?

336
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:05,047
Does he have a cold?

337
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:07,216
Yeah, that's giving
him way too much credit,

338
00:16:07,258 --> 00:16:08,885
he's probably
just skipping school.

339
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:09,760
[TAKEZO]
Oh.

340
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:10,970
I see.

341
00:16:11,012 --> 00:16:12,513
Thanks, anyway.

342
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:14,557
[TETSUKI]
Get it together, Chika.

343
00:16:15,016 --> 00:16:16,726
[TAKEZO]
I wonder if something happened.

344
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:18,478
Did Hozuki make him mad?

345
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:20,521
Is that it?

346
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:23,024
Do you think I'd stay here
after she said all that crap?

347
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:24,358
I quit, four‐eyes!

348
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,360
Nah, he'd never do that!

349
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:27,778
To be fair, though.

350
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:31,782
It's not like I know Kudo
exceptionally well or anything.

351
00:16:35,286 --> 00:16:36,162
[TAKEZO]
It'll be fine!

352
00:16:36,204 --> 00:16:37,997
He'll come tomorrow,
I'm sure of it!

353
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:38,581
Huh?

354
00:16:38,623 --> 00:16:39,832
He went home already?

355
00:16:39,874 --> 00:16:40,708
Why though?

356
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,418
What exactly is he sick with?

357
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:43,085
Uh.

358
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:44,420
I don't know the details.

359
00:16:44,462 --> 00:16:45,963
Sorry 'bout that.

360
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:47,548
[TAKEZO]
Kudo?

361
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:55,139
Wait! We're on the third floor!

362
00:16:58,893 --> 00:17:01,312
[SATOWA] I knew he was
nothing but a delinquent.

363
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:04,982
[TAKEZO] And just like that,
a whole week had passed.

364
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:07,693
Yeah. I'm sorry, I guess he
had some things to go do,

365
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:10,655
so he bailed early again today.

366
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:11,906
Hey, Takaoka?

367
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:13,491
Yes?

368
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:16,536
Are you hiding
something from me?

369
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:17,995
[TETSUKI]
Please don't be mad, Kurata.

370
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:20,831
Chika made me swear that
I wouldn't tell you anything.

371
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:21,916
But you should know.

372
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:23,459
[TAKEZO]
Hozuki!

373
00:17:26,504 --> 00:17:29,090
[STUDENT F] Why don't you watch
where the heck you're going?

374
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:31,092
[TAKEZO] It's those guys
from the light music club.

375
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:32,677
Oh. I'm so sorry!

376
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:35,304
[STUDENT G] Hey, he's the guy
who gave that lame presentation.

377
00:17:35,346 --> 00:17:36,264
[STUDENT F]
Wait, for real?

378
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:37,640
[STUDENT G]
Yeah, from the koto club!

379
00:17:37,682 --> 00:17:40,685
[STUDENT F] Oh right, man, that
performance was super pathetic.

380
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:42,979
Totally, he probably
scared everyone away!

381
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,355
Is that sad or what?

382
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:46,566
Leave him alone, idiot.

383
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:48,776
[STUDENT F]
Well, good luck, loser!

384
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:52,780
[SATOWA] If anything, you're
the ones who will need the luck.

385
00:17:52,822 --> 00:17:55,241
You have some nerve belittling
another person's performance

386
00:17:55,283 --> 00:17:57,535
when your own show
was completely out of tune.

387
00:17:57,577 --> 00:18:00,621
Perhaps that free time would be
better suited for practice.

388
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:02,623
[gasps]

389
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:04,250
Wow, that was amazing.

390
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:05,376
Hozuki!

391
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:07,420
I need you to
please come with me!

392
00:18:11,382 --> 00:18:12,592
That's the place.

393
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:13,301
Hold on.

394
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:15,970
This is the music store
where we sent the instruments.

395
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:17,013
Oh, hello there.

396
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:20,474
I'm guessing you guys
are Kudo's friends?

397
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:21,934
[TAKEZO]
Do you know him? Is he here?

398
00:18:21,976 --> 00:18:23,853
Yeah, he's inside. Go on in.

399
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:25,980
[CHIKA]
Ow!

400
00:18:26,022 --> 00:18:28,774
[SHIZU] Idiot! That's why
I say to do it carefully!

401
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:30,276
Yeah. Got it, okay?

402
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:32,570
[SHIZU] Don't you dare raise
your voice at an old lady!

403
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:33,946
I'm only letting you
help because you're

404
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:38,409
so annoyingly stubborn,
so show some gratitude!

405
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:40,369
Learn to respect your elders,
you punk.

406
00:18:40,411 --> 00:18:42,663
Yeah, well that punch didn't
feel very elderly like,

407
00:18:42,705 --> 00:18:43,497
ya old hag!

408
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:45,499
[SHIZU]
Who are you calling a hag?

409
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:46,334
[CHIKA]
That hurt!

410
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,668
Um. Okay.

411
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:48,753
Uh?

412
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:50,838
I should probably explain.

413
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:51,631
A week ago,

414
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:54,008
when we got the repair
request for the instruments.

415
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:56,510
Kudo showed up here
without warning.

416
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:57,386
Um.

417
00:18:57,428 --> 00:19:00,139
It's actually my fault
all the kotos got broken.

418
00:19:00,181 --> 00:19:02,266
So please let me help fix them.

419
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:03,559
[NISHINA]
Man.

420
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:05,311
He sure took me by surprise.

421
00:19:05,353 --> 00:19:08,522
But as you can see,
granny is no pushover.

422
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:10,191
[SHIZU] Tell me exactly
how you broke them.

423
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:11,567
Like I'd really let
someone who did this

424
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:13,319
to the kotos touch them again!

425
00:19:13,361 --> 00:19:14,779
Get lost!

426
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,239
[NISHINA] But he kept
coming back day after day.

427
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:19,033
He sat outside
the store for hours

428
00:19:19,075 --> 00:19:20,910
without eating or drinking.

429
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:22,870
So I kinda gave in.

430
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:25,373
Then, Granny
finally gave in, too.

431
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:26,832
But said she'd only let him help

432
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:28,793
if he told her how
the koto got broken

433
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:31,087
and why he wanted to fix them.

434
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:32,880
[TAKEZO]
So then, you know about Kudo?

435
00:19:32,922 --> 00:19:33,881
Yeah, I do.

436
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:35,675
We know about everything.

437
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:37,343
I'm sure it's probably
a pretty difficult thing

438
00:19:37,385 --> 00:19:41,305
for Kudo to talk about,
but he told us his whole past.

439
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:43,265
Why's he doing this?

440
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:46,060
Because he wanted
to "earn what it takes."

441
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:48,854
[NISHINA]
He said, "I may be an idiot,

442
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:49,939
and I don't know if it's okay

443
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:52,024
for a guy who
damaged one to play.

444
00:19:52,066 --> 00:19:53,567
But if I'm at least
acknowledged by someone

445
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:55,611
who can make
and repair the koto,

446
00:19:55,653 --> 00:19:58,155
then I can earn what it takes.

447
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:01,283
"And maybe I'd be able
to proudly face the koto."

448
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:05,371
Is something wrong?

449
00:20:05,413 --> 00:20:06,288
That idiot.

450
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:08,499
Just how simple‐minded
can he be?

451
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,376
I'm honestly amazed.

452
00:20:10,418 --> 00:20:12,920
As for the sound he produces,

453
00:20:12,962 --> 00:20:15,423
I'm sure it's just
as brash as he is.

454
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:17,299
I'm not sure.

455
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:18,342
Um, hey.

456
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:22,388
I'm really sorry,
and about earlier, thank you.

457
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:24,181
You were right
about what I wanted.

458
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,725
About nationals.

459
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:28,352
It was just a dream,
but I wanted to make it.

460
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:31,063
But after failing
so miserably last year.

461
00:20:31,105 --> 00:20:33,941
Well, I guess I was afraid of
trying to aim higher than that.

462
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:36,444
Because I couldn't
face losing again.

463
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:37,319
Well,

464
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:40,197
I suppose I did come off
as a bit arrogant at first.

465
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,615
It's my first time
being in a club,

466
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:44,535
so I'm not entirely sure
what attitude to have.

467
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:47,455
It's going to be a bit of
an adjustment for me.

468
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:50,624
But I'll do my best to learn,
so let's start over.

469
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:54,253
May I please have permission
to join the koto club?

470
00:20:54,295 --> 00:20:55,963
Of course!

471
00:20:58,174 --> 00:20:59,216
Excellent!

472
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:00,634
So then, now
we can officially aim

473
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:02,261
for first place
at nationals, right?

474
00:21:02,303 --> 00:21:03,220
[TAKEZO]
Ugh.

475
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:05,473
I guess some things
aren't gonna change.

476
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:06,849
However, I'll have you know.

477
00:21:06,891 --> 00:21:08,934
Even though I'm
aiming for first place,

478
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:11,562
I didn't pick just
any old school.

479
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:12,688
Huh?

480
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:14,607
I don't understand.

481
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:17,568
Hold up, what are
you guys doing here?

482
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:19,945
[SHIZU] Hey! Be more
careful with those tools!

483
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:21,989
I swear, you're a lost cause!

484
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:22,782
Oh?

485
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:24,742
These your friends from school?

486
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:26,827
Yes. We're members
of the koto club.

487
00:21:26,869 --> 00:21:29,413
Ah. I suppose you must
having a hard time of it,

488
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:32,500
especially with this
moron for a member.

489
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,168
Might you be...?

490
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:38,714
So, uh...

491
00:21:38,756 --> 00:21:40,132
Can we help with anything?

492
00:21:40,174 --> 00:21:42,551
Like maybe with
repairing the instruments?

493
00:21:43,594 --> 00:21:46,680
We are members of
the same club, after all.

494
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:49,391
Yes, it would our
pleasure to assist you.

495
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:50,726
[gasps]

496
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:53,437
Hey!

497
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:54,730
Are you guys kidding?

498
00:21:54,772 --> 00:21:56,357
I don't need any
of your stupid help!

499
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:57,983
Besides, you can't
barge in here.

500
00:21:58,025 --> 00:21:59,777
It took forever to get
her to approve of me!

501
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:01,987
[SHIZU]
Sure, the help would be nice.

502
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:03,531
Thank you so much.

503
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:06,075
You mean, wishy‐washy
old hag, why do they get in

504
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:08,118
so easy after I had
to work so freakin' hard?

505
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,120
And while I'm at it, remind
me to kick Tetsuki's ass

506
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:11,831
the next time I see
that stupid blabbermouth!

507
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:13,123
[SATOWA] Can you hear
how annoying you are?

508
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:13,707
Well sorry!

509
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:16,836
Didn't mean to offend little
Miss Koto Queen, just shut up!

510
00:23:56,977 --> 00:24:00,064
[TAKEZO] Next time:
"The Koto Club Reborn."
