162
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:39,227
but I heard that dragons can
bring together heaven and earth.

163
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:42,397
They can connect the worlds
of the living and the dead,

164
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:44,149
isn't that interesting?

165
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:47,027
Oh, so if I play the koto,
does that mean my sound

166
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:49,738
will reach Daddy all
the way up in heaven?

167
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:52,240
Of course!

168
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:53,992
I'm sure that you
could reach him.

169
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:55,869
It'll connect you two.

170
00:08:57,704 --> 00:08:59,122
[SATOWA]
Tell her!

171
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:00,707
Tell her!

172
00:09:00,749 --> 00:09:02,167
All I want...

173
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:05,462
All I want is for it to be
like it was before!

174
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:12,594
[pants]

175
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:14,846
To think that girl's only 15.

176
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:17,932
[AUDIENCE cheers]

177
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:19,100
Mother.

178
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:21,561
How dare you.
What were even you thinking?

179
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:23,229
How could you do this?

180
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:24,981
[SATOWA]
Listen.

181
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:26,775
Don't touch me!

182
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:30,361
You can't possibly understand.

183
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,030
How heavy a burden
it is for someone

184
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:35,575
who isn't talented to
shoulder someone who is.

185
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:39,746
Your koto playing feels
like a weapon to me.

186
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:47,504
[SATOWA]
It didn't reach her.

187
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:51,591
[SATOWA]
It didn't reach her!

188
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:00,225
Am I crying?

189
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,601
This girl...

190
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:04,979
Wow, the Hozuki heir sure
messed up big time, didn't she?

191
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:06,064
[DOJIMA]
My goodness!

192
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:09,400
The Hozuki School's
reputation will be ruined!

193
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:15,031
[SATOWA]
I'm such an idiot.

194
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:17,367
You've skipped out
on koto practice

195
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:18,535
the last two days in a row.

196
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:21,037
What exactly has gotten
into you, young lady?

197
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:22,080
[SATOWA]
Nothing.

198
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:23,706
I just thought that maybe
it would be easier

199
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:27,127
for you this way.

200
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:29,879
Now you don't have
to shoulder me anymore.

201
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:35,343
[SATOWA] All that practicing,
but nothing changed.

202
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:37,262
Things only got worse.

203
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:40,431
There's no reason
for me to play anymore.

204
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:41,683
[DOJIMA]
What is Satowa doing?

205
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:44,227
She's missed all
of her lessons lately!

206
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:49,065
You skipped your
lessons again, didn't you?

207
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:52,527
I'm starting to think you
don't have any motivation.

208
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:54,487
Does it matter?

209
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:01,578
Wait.

210
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:04,205
Didn't Kudo come
to my place yesterday?

211
00:11:04,247 --> 00:11:06,166
A dream?

212
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:07,167
[shrieks]

213
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,877
It wasn't a dream? Oh!

214
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:10,044
Oh, you're awake?

215
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:11,129
Can you tone down the shouting?

216
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:12,672
It's too early
for all that crap.

217
00:11:12,714 --> 00:11:15,508
First tell me why
you're in my apartment!

218
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,135
Because you can't leave
a sick person at home

219
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:19,304
by themselves, obviously.

220
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:22,098
So you just decided to
stay the night uninvited?

221
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,641
[CHIKA] If you have
enough energy to protest,

222
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,768
you must be okay.

223
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:28,521
And your fever...

224
00:11:28,563 --> 00:11:30,231
...is gone.

225
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:31,566
Well, I'm going to school.

226
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:32,525
Catch ya later.

227
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:33,985
Get back here, Kudo!

228
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:34,611
Um.

229
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:36,863
Why aren't you saying anything?

230
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:38,323
About where I live?

231
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:39,532
Huh? Oh.

232
00:11:39,574 --> 00:11:43,077
I figure your school isn't
making that much money, right?

233
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:44,871
[SATOWA]
Uh... Listen.

234
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:46,998
[CHIKA] Look, if you ever
feel like talking about it,

235
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,249
just talk.

236
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:50,543
And restock your fridge
every once in a while.

237
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:52,086
It's like a barren
wasteland in there.

238
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:53,129
Kinda pathetic.

239
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:56,341
Uh, what were you
doing in my fridge?

240
00:11:57,842 --> 00:12:00,345
What was that?

241
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:02,597
That's odd.

242
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,724
I don't remember
cooking yesterday.

243
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:06,517
[gasps]

244
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,020
Egg and rice porridge?

245
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:26,996
[TAKEZO] I wonder what
was up with Kurusu yesterday.

246
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:29,207
She was acting really strange.

247
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:30,208
Kurata!

248
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:30,917
Hey!

249
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,877
[shrieks]
Good morning!

250
00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:37,257
So, uh, about yesterday.

251
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:38,675
Yeah, I was wondering.

252
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:40,718
You said that you thought
everyone in the koto club

253
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,512
were pretty close
friends, right?

254
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:45,723
But what if you found out one
of them was deceiving everyone?

255
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,684
Would you think differently?

256
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:49,060
Huh? Hold on.

257
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:50,395
What's that mean?

258
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:51,938
Oh, you'll find out.

259
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,148
I'll see you at club.

260
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:05,702
Hozuki!

261
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:07,287
I'm so happy you're here today!

262
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:08,538
[SANE]
Bad Kota, stop it!

263
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:10,081
Down boy!

264
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:11,582
Sorry, we're just
glad you're back,

265
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,251
you were out sick
yesterday right?

266
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:14,210
How do you feel now?

267
00:13:14,252 --> 00:13:15,545
[SATOWA]
Uh, better.

268
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:17,797
Here's some food to help
you regain your strength.

269
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,009
[SATOWA]
Thank you.

270
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,218
The thing is...

271
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:26,723
I'm so sorry, you got sick
because of all of us, huh?

272
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:29,517
Come on, are you still going
on about that nonsense?

273
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:30,643
It's so stupid.

274
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:32,186
These guys actually
think you stayed home

275
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:34,564
'cause you got tired
of how bad we are.

276
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:37,108
What? But that's
just ridiculous.

277
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,986
I enjoy this club,
because it's fun.

278
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:40,945
[sobbing]

279
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:41,612
Really?

280
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:44,449
If that's the case, then why
won't you tell us the truth?

281
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,451
[SANE]
Huh? What do you mean?

282
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:48,286
I'm sorry, Hozuki.

283
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:51,372
My grandmother told me all
about your recent troubles.

284
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:54,167
Seeing as you don't have
anywhere else to play the koto.

285
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:56,878
You had no choice
but to join the club.

286
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:59,505
Meaning this place is nothing
more than an escape.

287
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:02,216
Somewhere to hide from
your shame, is that correct?

288
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:05,803
I'm guessing that's why you
haven't told anyone about it.

289
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:07,430
Hey, Kurusu.

290
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:10,224
Does this have anything to do
with what you said this morning?

291
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:12,518
Ah, sorry to be so mysterious.

292
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,063
It seemed like Hozuki was too
embarrassed to tell anyone,

293
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:16,439
which is why I spoke up.

294
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:17,857
[SATOWA]
Enough.

295
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:20,693
I will be the one to
tell people about myself.

296
00:14:20,735 --> 00:14:22,111
[gasps]

297
00:14:22,153 --> 00:14:25,031
And what's more, while I did
hide the truth from them,

298
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:25,698
it's only because

299
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:29,285
I wasn't quite ready to
acknowledge it myself yet.

300
00:14:29,327 --> 00:14:34,665
But I think I'm ready
to face it now.

301
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:37,460
I'm sorry.

302
00:14:37,502 --> 00:14:39,921
I should have
told you this sooner.

303
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:44,926
That's fine, then starting
today you are excommunicated.

304
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:45,968
You see.

305
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:48,888
I was excommunicated
from the school.

306
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:52,809
[HIRO]
Oh my, they look angry.

307
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,435
But that's to be expected.

308
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:56,646
She was keeping
a pretty big secret.

309
00:14:56,687 --> 00:15:01,150
Honestly, relationships between
people fall apart so easily.

310
00:15:01,192 --> 00:15:03,069
Words like "trust"
and "friendship"

311
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:04,695
are just lip service.

312
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,030
What's that word mean?

313
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:06,906
Big word.

314
00:15:06,948 --> 00:15:07,698
Ah...!

315
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,951
I'm saying that I've been
cut off from the school.

316
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:11,744
I've been dismissed
as the next heir.

317
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:13,287
Now do you get it?

318
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:15,623
[CHIKA]
I was just wondering

319
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:17,667
if you learned how
to play from your parents.

320
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:19,669
[SATOWA] That's not
something you need to know.

321
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:22,755
[TAKEZO] Does that mean
her mother disowned her?

322
00:15:22,797 --> 00:15:25,425
Um, well.

323
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:27,051
In that case,

324
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:28,094
thanks for sharing!

325
00:15:28,136 --> 00:15:29,220
Really.

326
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:33,307
So that's how it is?

327
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:35,435
Things must have
been so hard for you!

328
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:36,936
You can have all my bread!

329
00:15:36,978 --> 00:15:39,355
In the meantime, start
taking better care of yourself,

331
00:15:40,982 --> 00:15:42,733
[TAKEZO] Is that really the
nicest way you could think

332
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:46,487
to phrase that sentence?

333
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:49,073
Hold on. You're serious?

334
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:50,992
She lies and you thank her?

335
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:53,995
This is the most hilarious
train wreck I've ever witnessed.

336
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:55,455
Isn't that great?

337
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:58,416
You're all such good friends.

338
00:15:58,458 --> 00:15:59,792
Ridiculous!

339
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:03,171
Huh? Whoa! Kurusu!

340
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:04,046
Hold on!

341
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:06,007
Please, I just
wanna talk to you!

342
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:07,800
[HIRO]
Jeez, you're so annoying!

343
00:16:07,842 --> 00:16:09,760
You guys managed
to ruin my whole plan.

344
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,262
In fact, instead of
breaking you apart,

345
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:12,722
I've only made you stronger.

346
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:15,349
It pisses me off!

347
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:17,643
Did you actually think
I joined the koto club

348
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:20,646
because I was moved by
your dumb performance?

349
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:22,440
Seeing you stand on that
stage and talk about how

350
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:24,066
you weren't going to lose
your precious friends

351
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:27,528
or the place you belong only
made me want to tease you.

352
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:28,404
Know what?

353
00:16:28,446 --> 00:16:30,448
I hate even looking at you.

354
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,658
You disgust me!

355
00:16:35,036 --> 00:16:37,205
Is that all you wanted to say?

356
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:39,665
I feel kinda bad.

357
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:42,376
You must have
a lot of free time.

358
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:49,258
[HIRO]
It's not fair.

359
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,052
I hate them all!

360
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:51,844
So hey.

361
00:16:51,886 --> 00:16:52,512
Hiro.

362
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:53,888
I heard that you've
been talking about me

363
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:57,099
behind my back to
all of your friends.

364
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:58,518
Huh? What do you mean?

365
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:00,144
I haven't done
anything like that.

366
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:00,895
[HIRO'S FRIEND A]
Liar!

367
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:02,855
Minami told us how
you've been harassing her

368
00:17:02,897 --> 00:17:04,941
because you're afraid
she'll steal your boyfriend!

369
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:05,983
[HIRO'S EX‐BOYFRIEND]
Unbelievable.

370
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,109
That's so low.

371
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:09,195
[HIRO'S FRIEND B]
You're the worst.

372
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:11,113
[HIRO]
Wait!

373
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:12,865
I never did those things!

374
00:17:12,907 --> 00:17:15,535
I haven't been harassing her!

375
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:17,912
Please listen to me!

376
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:18,913
They didn't.

377
00:17:18,955 --> 00:17:21,040
It was huge lie she'd made up.

378
00:17:21,082 --> 00:17:24,293
All so she could go and
steal my boyfriend from me,

379
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:27,296
and everyone just believed her.

380
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:29,298
She had transferred to
my class in the second year

381
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:32,301
of middle school, so naturally
I'd already known my friends

382
00:17:32,343 --> 00:17:35,346
and boyfriend for much
longer than she had.

383
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:38,891
And yet, for some reason
they didn't believe me.

384
00:17:38,933 --> 00:17:41,686
Was I that untrustworthy?

385
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:42,937
I thought.

386
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:45,773
Maybe all relationships
were like that.

387
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:46,941
Excuse me.

388
00:17:46,983 --> 00:17:50,903
After that, whenever I'd see
people who seemed close,

389
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:54,574
I'd find a way to befriend
them before making up a lie.

390
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:58,953
And then, as expected,
everyone would fall apart.

391
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:03,874
[HIRO] That's why I thought
this time would be the same!

392
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,501
I was positive everything
would crumble

393
00:18:05,543 --> 00:18:08,254
once I gave them a little nudge!

394
00:18:08,296 --> 00:18:09,088
[CHIKA]
Well.

395
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:12,091
I don't believe anything
unless I hear it firsthand.

396
00:18:12,133 --> 00:18:13,259
[TAKEZO]
Thanks for sharing!

397
00:18:13,301 --> 00:18:15,678
Really.

398
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:18,431
[HIRO]
Those idiots!

399
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:21,684
They were supposed to react
to everything differently!

400
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:25,938
[HIRO]
This is the worst.

401
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:31,027
Man!

402
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:33,321
I really hate it when
people don't make sense!

403
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:38,701
Forget about that, Specs.
Hurry up and teach me "Rokudan."

404
00:18:38,743 --> 00:18:39,619
What?

405
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,620
I'm sorry.

406
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:42,330
[SANE]
Chika apologized?

407
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:44,165
How far did you get yesterday?

408
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:46,959
I only got through the first
column before I got lost.

409
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,294
I didn't understand the goal.

410
00:18:48,336 --> 00:18:50,546
Because there is no goal.

411
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:53,049
Classical pieces are fluid.

412
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:53,966
So what school.

413
00:18:54,008 --> 00:18:56,010
Who decides to perform it.

414
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:58,763
The sound always changes due
to different interpretations

415
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:01,223
and thoughts that
pile up over time.

416
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:04,602
It becomes quite complicated.

417
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:06,228
Just like people.

418
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:09,690
You have to face it head on
to understand it, right?

419
00:19:09,732 --> 00:19:13,027
Until the sound
finally comes to you.

420
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:18,032
[TAKEZO]
Hold on.

421
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:19,617
After what you said yesterday,

422
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:21,911
I was the one who
wanted to cry, but...

423
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:24,580
...why were you crying, Kurusu?

424
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:27,708
[HIRO]
Why do you care?

425
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:31,545
Do you wanna play the hero that
comforts me when I tell you?

426
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,172
No, I really don't.

427
00:19:33,214 --> 00:19:34,256
Still, though.

428
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:35,716
I don't know your reason.

429
00:19:35,758 --> 00:19:38,010
Hence the question.

430
00:19:38,052 --> 00:19:40,137
If you'll talk to me seriously,

431
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,806
then I'll listen.

432

00:19:54,652 --> 00:19:56,404
Huh?

What now?

436
00:19:57,822 --> 00:20:00,616
Look. About yesterday.

437
00:20:00,658 --> 00:20:02,618
You told everyone that
I joined the koto club

438
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:04,120
because I had
nowhere else to play,

439
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:06,872
and that I was using it
as an escape, right?

440
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:08,541
But you were wrong about me.

441
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:12,169
The truth is I joined the
koto club because I wanted to.

442
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,671
Why are you telling me that?

443
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:15,548
Are you trying to
rub it in my face?

444
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:16,966
[SATOWA]
No, it's because

445
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:19,927
I just thought maybe
we were the same.

446

If you want to know the real
reason why I joined the club,

then I'll tell you why.

448

[SATOWA]
A music performance?

449

A koto club.

they're not all that great,

they're having a lot of fun.

I'm jealous.

Like always, the club
will meet after school.

455
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:09,685
You won't make a good impression

made a really bad impression.

If you stand there blocking
the door, nobody can get in.
