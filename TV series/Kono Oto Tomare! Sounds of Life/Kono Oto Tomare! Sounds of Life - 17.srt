1
00:00:17,317 --> 00:00:20,400
[SATOWA] All I wanted,
was to get it back.

2
00:00:20,483 --> 00:00:22,192
That precious time.

3
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,192
[SATOWA]
I swore to myself

4
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:28,025
that I'd protect that place
with everything I had.

5
00:00:28,108 --> 00:00:29,817
Nothing else mattered.

6
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:31,483
I didn't care what
people thought of me

7
00:00:31,567 --> 00:00:33,775
or if they shunned me.

8
00:00:33,858 --> 00:00:35,150
Mother!

9
00:00:35,233 --> 00:00:37,400
I don't want to be alone!

10
00:00:37,483 --> 00:00:39,400
Don't isolate yourself.

11
00:00:39,483 --> 00:00:41,233
Don't push me away!

12
00:00:41,317 --> 00:00:43,858
I promise that
I'll work hard with you!

13
00:00:46,567 --> 00:00:49,775
[SATOWA] But, in the end,
playing the koto was all I had.

14
00:00:49,858 --> 00:00:51,900
So, I staked everything.

15
00:00:51,983 --> 00:00:54,150
All of it on my sound.

16
00:00:54,233 --> 00:00:56,025
I wanted to fight for us,

17
00:00:56,108 --> 00:00:58,983
and I thought that if
I just tried hard enough,

18
00:00:59,067 --> 00:01:02,025
then my feelings would
finally get through to her.

19
00:01:02,108 --> 00:01:05,108
Because I truly
believed in my sound.

20
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:12,900
[CHIHARU] Your koto playing
feels like a weapon to me.

21
00:01:12,983 --> 00:01:15,400
A weapon?

22
00:01:23,358 --> 00:01:25,608
[SATOWA] I haven't had
that dream in a while.

23
00:01:25,692 --> 00:01:27,692
So, I don't understand.

24
00:01:27,775 --> 00:01:28,942
Why now?

25
00:01:29,025 --> 00:01:32,442
But, for them, this is
their last opportunity.

26
00:01:32,525 --> 00:01:35,025
[SATOWA] What he said
reminded me of something.

27
00:01:35,108 --> 00:01:36,608
I've avoided thinking about it,

28
00:01:36,692 --> 00:01:39,483
but this life
can't last forever.

29
00:01:39,567 --> 00:01:43,900
My time with the club
will eventually end.

30
00:01:43,983 --> 00:01:46,650
What will I do
when that happens?

31
00:01:46,733 --> 00:01:47,858
I see.

32
00:01:47,942 --> 00:01:50,775
I suppose I'm still
afraid of being alone.

33
00:01:50,858 --> 00:01:52,192
Pathetic.

34
00:01:54,233 --> 00:01:55,442
[SATOWA]
For right now,

35
00:01:55,525 --> 00:01:58,483
I just have to focus
on getting to nationals.

36
00:01:58,567 --> 00:02:00,900
We have to make it
there together.

37
00:03:32,067 --> 00:03:33,108
[HIRO]
Kurata?

38
00:03:33,192 --> 00:03:34,150
Oh. Morning!

39
00:03:34,233 --> 00:03:35,692
Here for some solo practice?

40
00:03:35,775 --> 00:03:37,442
Kind of.

41
00:03:37,525 --> 00:03:39,442
Yeah, that's why I'm here.

42
00:03:42,192 --> 00:03:43,358
[HIRO]
I am such an idiot!

43
00:03:43,442 --> 00:03:46,192
C'mon brain, we talked
about this yesterday!

44
00:03:46,275 --> 00:03:47,817
Um. Are you okay?

45
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,483
[HIRO] It's all right
to have feelings for him,

46
00:03:49,567 --> 00:03:52,483
but I won't tell him about them
until we're done with the club!

47
00:03:52,567 --> 00:03:54,025
I can't let him figure it out.

48
00:03:54,108 --> 00:03:56,692
I refuse to cause problems
for the club or our performance!

49
00:03:56,775 --> 00:03:58,442
Those were our rules,
brain, remember?

50
00:03:58,525 --> 00:04:01,358
And yet, there is one thing
I really wanna ask him.

51
00:04:01,442 --> 00:04:02,525
Uh. Kurusu?

52
00:04:02,608 --> 00:04:03,733
[HIRO]
Tell me something.

53
00:04:03,817 --> 00:04:05,817
Do you like the old club
president, Mashiro?

54
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:06,900
[TAKEZO gasps]

55
00:04:06,983 --> 00:04:09,025
What? You wanna know that, huh?

56
00:04:09,108 --> 00:04:11,108
[HIRO]
Whoa. He's super rattled.

57
00:04:11,192 --> 00:04:12,900
Does that mean?

58
00:04:12,983 --> 00:04:14,025
I guess.

59
00:04:14,108 --> 00:04:15,733
Yeah, I would say
that I do like her.

60
00:04:17,025 --> 00:04:19,067
Okay. Good to know.

61
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:20,650
It's fine, don't panic.

62
00:04:20,733 --> 00:04:22,900
I'll just focus on club stuff
and working hard.

63
00:04:22,983 --> 00:04:24,275
I mean I like her as a person,

64
00:04:24,358 --> 00:04:26,317
and I have a lot
of respect for her.

65
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,150
I'd say it's more admiration
than anything romantic.

66
00:04:30,233 --> 00:04:32,275
I'm kinda curious
why you'd ask that, though.

67
00:04:32,358 --> 00:04:34,150
Oh, I see!

68
00:04:34,233 --> 00:04:35,150
[TAKEZO]
Huh?

69
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:37,567
Wait, aren't you
gonna tell me why?

70
00:04:37,983 --> 00:04:38,692
[HIRO]
Huh?

71
00:04:38,775 --> 00:04:40,900
You're here early, today!

72
00:04:40,983 --> 00:04:43,233
[SATOWA]
Hiro. Takezo.

73
00:04:43,317 --> 00:04:44,858
[CHIKA groans]
Dammit!

74
00:04:44,942 --> 00:04:46,317
You guys all beat me?

75
00:04:48,025 --> 00:04:51,692
[CHIKA] I was positive I'd
be the first one here, too!

76
00:04:51,775 --> 00:04:52,983
What's up?

77
00:04:53,067 --> 00:04:54,650
Besides your bed head?

78
00:04:54,733 --> 00:04:57,025
Nothing much past that
wild mane you call hair.

79
00:04:57,108 --> 00:04:59,650
Don't you make fun
of my hair, it's in style!

80
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:01,233
[SATOWA]
Huh?

81
00:05:01,317 --> 00:05:02,942
I didn't know looking like a bum
was such a fashion statement.

82
00:05:03,025 --> 00:05:05,483
Well, better to be a bum
than a stuck up princess!

83
00:05:05,567 --> 00:05:06,358
Jeez!

84
00:05:06,442 --> 00:05:09,108
Guess we're back to normal.

85
00:05:09,192 --> 00:05:11,233
Oh nice, looks
like everyone's here.

86
00:05:11,317 --> 00:05:12,275
[HIRO]
Good morning!

87
00:05:12,358 --> 00:05:14,275
About the piece
for the qualifier.

88
00:05:14,358 --> 00:05:15,525
Do "Yaegoromo."

89
00:05:15,608 --> 00:05:16,400
Hold on.

90
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:17,733
Why "Yaegoromo"?

91
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,400
That's like a classical piece.

92
00:05:19,483 --> 00:05:20,733
Is that suited for us?

93
00:05:20,817 --> 00:05:21,733
Really now?

94
00:05:21,817 --> 00:05:23,983
What I heard
sounded more modern.

95
00:05:24,067 --> 00:05:27,192
You played it in
this performance.

96
00:05:27,275 --> 00:05:28,483
[CHIKA]
No way!

97
00:05:28,567 --> 00:05:31,317
I know that one,
I've actually seen it before!

98
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,150
You seriously think
we can play that piece?

99
00:05:33,233 --> 00:05:34,567
[KOTA]
Wait, so you know this song?

100
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:36,483
[SANE]
Cool! Tell us all about it!

101
00:05:36,567 --> 00:05:37,650
[SATOWA gasps]

102
00:05:37,733 --> 00:05:38,733
But...

103
00:05:38,817 --> 00:05:40,358
...this isn't the
real "Yaegoromo."

104
00:05:40,442 --> 00:05:42,483
You'll have to pick
a different song.

105
00:05:42,567 --> 00:05:43,650
[TAKINAMI]
Why?

106
00:05:43,733 --> 00:05:45,317
[SATOWA]
This is a solo.

107
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,775
That's not a problem, I'll
change it to be an ensemble.

108
00:05:47,858 --> 00:05:49,108
Listen.

109
00:05:49,192 --> 00:05:51,192
A piece like this can't
reach the heart of anyone!

110
00:05:51,275 --> 00:05:53,025
It won't take us to nationals.

111
00:05:53,108 --> 00:05:54,650
So we can't play it!

112
00:05:55,442 --> 00:05:56,775
Tell me.

113
00:05:56,858 --> 00:05:59,567
Have you taken the time to
hear your own performance?

114
00:06:00,692 --> 00:06:02,108
Fine, whatever.

115
00:06:02,192 --> 00:06:03,400
Anyway, I'd like for all of you

116
00:06:03,483 --> 00:06:06,358
to head on to the
audiovisual room.

117
00:06:06,442 --> 00:06:09,275
We just got the video
for the last music festival.

118
00:06:09,358 --> 00:06:11,067
We're going to listen to both
your performance

119
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:14,025
and to Hakuto's,
the school that won.

120
00:06:16,608 --> 00:06:18,525
First, I'll play Hakuto's.

121
00:06:19,983 --> 00:06:21,692
[MITTSU]
Whoa, what a weird formation.

122
00:06:21,775 --> 00:06:24,900
[SANE] Why's he sitting up front
like he's the star of the show?

123
00:06:24,983 --> 00:06:28,275
[TAKINAMI] Well, because
he is the star of the show.

124
00:06:28,358 --> 00:06:29,817
[CHIKA]
That's him.

125
00:06:32,233 --> 00:06:34,025
[CHIKA]
Wait, what is this?

126
00:06:34,108 --> 00:06:35,358
Why?

127
00:06:35,442 --> 00:06:37,775
It's not that flashy
by any means,

128
00:06:37,858 --> 00:06:41,400
and yet his sound flows
right into my head.

129
00:06:41,483 --> 00:06:44,733
[TAKINAMI] That's what
Hakuto's performance is like.

130
00:06:44,817 --> 00:06:46,317
How interesting.

131
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,608
Yeah, to be honest,

132
00:06:47,692 --> 00:06:49,942
classical music has
never really been my jam,

133
00:06:50,025 --> 00:06:51,942
but this feels
different somehow.

134
00:06:52,025 --> 00:06:53,650
[CHIKA] Of all the
performances I've ever heard,

135
00:06:53,733 --> 00:06:55,983
this one is probably
the least showy.

136
00:06:56,067 --> 00:06:58,275
But I can't seem to look away.

137
00:06:58,358 --> 00:07:00,067
[SATOWA]
Their pauses and tempo.

138
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:02,400
It's like their sounds
build up quietly,

139
00:07:02,483 --> 00:07:05,525
with just the right splash
of color at the perfect time,

140
00:07:05,608 --> 00:07:07,608
as if it were all calculated.

141
00:07:07,692 --> 00:07:09,650
[TAKINAMI] Hakuto may not have
the impressive togetherness

142
00:07:09,733 --> 00:07:14,650
that Himesaka does, or the
flamboyant impact of Meiryo.

143
00:07:14,733 --> 00:07:16,025
But their performance

144
00:07:16,108 --> 00:07:18,942
basically serves as "the
right answer" to this piece.

145
00:07:19,025 --> 00:07:20,108
"Right answer"?

146
00:07:20,192 --> 00:07:22,108
I don't like using
that term for music,

147
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:23,817
but I do understand
what you mean.

148
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,567
To make a classical song
that entrancing

149
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:27,275
is quite the accomplishment.

150
00:07:27,358 --> 00:07:28,108
You're wrong.

151
00:07:28,192 --> 00:07:29,608
This isn't a classic piece.

152
00:07:29,692 --> 00:07:31,858
The song that they
played was an original.

153
00:07:31,942 --> 00:07:32,942
[SATOWA]
An original?

154
00:07:33,025 --> 00:07:33,900
[TAKINAMI]
Furthermore,

155
00:07:33,983 --> 00:07:35,400
I believe it was composed

156
00:07:35,483 --> 00:07:37,900
in order to emphasize the
sound of the boy in the middle.

157
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:40,775
It was written so he could
be the core of this song.

158
00:07:40,858 --> 00:07:42,442
Look at the structure
of the piece

159
00:07:42,525 --> 00:07:44,233
and the sounds
of the other parts.

160
00:07:44,317 --> 00:07:46,650
They're all carefully calculated
and arranged in a way

161
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:48,483
to make his sound
really stand out

162
00:07:48,567 --> 00:07:50,608
and shine during
the performance.

163
00:07:50,692 --> 00:07:51,817
It would appear that Hakuto

164
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,775
has a very talented
composer in their club.

165
00:07:54,858 --> 00:07:57,025
[TAKEZO]
A composer.

166
00:07:57,108 --> 00:07:59,442
If you guys are set
on going to nationals,

167
00:07:59,525 --> 00:08:02,275
then you need to be able
to beat schools like Hakuto.

168
00:08:04,858 --> 00:08:06,733
But you said that they
were the right answer.

169
00:08:06,817 --> 00:08:08,900
How are we supposed
to beat that?

170
00:08:08,983 --> 00:08:11,108
Easy, you have to
surpass the right answer.

171
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:15,483
Just because something is right
doesn't mean it's the best.

172
00:08:16,442 --> 00:08:19,025
Next up is your performance.

173
00:08:19,108 --> 00:08:20,483
At a glance,

174
00:08:20,567 --> 00:08:22,525
it's pretty rough and relies
way too much on momentum.

175
00:08:22,608 --> 00:08:24,317
You lack a lot of skills.

176
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,525
But you're capable of putting
your emotions into the music.

177
00:08:27,608 --> 00:08:30,525
And that's your
biggest weapon right now.

178
00:08:30,608 --> 00:08:32,275
So... if you ask me,

179
00:08:32,358 --> 00:08:34,275
I think this piece
has the best potential

180
00:08:34,358 --> 00:08:36,108
of bringing out that ability.

181
00:08:36,192 --> 00:08:37,442
Even if it was a solo.

182
00:08:37,525 --> 00:08:39,192
I can consider the
balance of your power,

183
00:08:39,275 --> 00:08:40,650
as well as your sound quality,

184
00:08:40,733 --> 00:08:44,025
and change the composition
to best suit each of you.

185
00:08:44,108 --> 00:08:48,567
This is the piece I recommend,
but ultimately, it's up to you.

186
00:08:49,483 --> 00:08:51,192
That's a tough decision.

[SATOWA] Of all the pieces, why
did Mr. Takinami pick this one?

189
00:09:04,608 --> 00:09:05,775

Hm? Kudo?

I just feel like eating
my lunch over here today.

You've heard
this performance before?

[CHIKA]
Yeah.

196
00:09:22,775 --> 00:09:24,317
When I was at
your place that one time.

197
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,900
Without asking me?

198
00:09:25,983 --> 00:09:27,150
I did ask you.

199
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:28,733
You were kind of asleep.

200
00:09:28,817 --> 00:09:32,192
And if I had to choose between
her tones from then and now.

201
00:09:32,275 --> 00:09:34,317
I'd pick her current,
gentler sound.

202
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,692
In a damn heartbeat.

203
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:41,900
[SATOWA] What did you
think about this piece?

204
00:09:41,983 --> 00:09:43,567
When you heard it?

205
00:09:44,942 --> 00:09:46,317
Well, it hurt.

206
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,317
I mean.

207
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,275
It felt stressful.

[SATOWA]
No.

209

But why?

210
00:09:51,983 --> 00:09:56,567
All I wanted was to be able to
make my mother smile again.

211
00:09:56,650 --> 00:09:58,650
When I first heard your tone,

212
00:09:58,733 --> 00:10:01,067
I thought it sounded
like screaming.

213

Hey.

214

Kudo?

215
00:10:07,233 --> 00:10:10,733
I asked Takinami to export
the audio file from the DVD.

216
00:10:10,817 --> 00:10:13,150
You still haven't listened
to your playing, have you?

217
00:10:13,233 --> 00:10:15,067
No. I haven't had the chance.

218
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:16,608
I don't know what this
piece means to you,

219
00:10:16,692 --> 00:10:19,442
or why you haven't had
the courage to face it yet.

220
00:10:19,525 --> 00:10:22,150
But maybe we could
face it together.

This is what I sounded like?

223
00:10:31,983 --> 00:10:33,608
Instead of making her smile,

224
00:10:33,692 --> 00:10:35,525
all I managed to do
was express the pain

225

going through at the time.

convey aren't in this piece,

can take us to nationals?

When I played this piece,

252
00:11:50,317 --> 00:11:51,358
I was hoping the people

253
00:11:51,442 --> 00:11:53,358
who listened to it
would want to smile.

No, I didn't mean

you have to force
yourselves to smile either.

257
00:11:59,108 --> 00:12:01,275
I ended up putting the wrong
emotions into the piece

when I performed it.

259

But since we're going
to play it together,

260
00:12:04,817 --> 00:12:06,442
I thought that maybe...

261
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:09,525
...we could make it
more positive this time.

262

[TAKINAMI]
Hmm...

263
00:12:10,983 --> 00:12:12,775
I definitely think
that's possible.

264
00:12:12,858 --> 00:12:14,650
So don't play like
what you just saw.

the motif big time.

Yeah, that sound's engraved
into my very heart and soul!

It was necessary.

In order to be positive,

271
00:12:25,317 --> 00:12:27,192
you had to hear what
it sounded like before

272
00:12:27,275 --> 00:12:28,775
because the only way
to express yang is

if you can also express yin.

I meant to ask you before, but
what's the title of this piece?

00:14:51,317 --> 00:14:51,942
Um.

00:14:52,025 --> 00:14:53,525
I never chose one.

Well, at least now I know why
you lost sight of the emotions.

Hurry up and pick a title.

Okay.

What do I do?

339
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:06,442
I'm really bad at
coming up with names.

340

[SANE]
Listen closely.

341
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:11,317
These are the strings
of the bass koto.

342
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,900
In my opinion, it's better
to sit closer to the middle

343
00:15:13,983 --> 00:15:15,900
than you would
with a normal koto.

344
00:15:15,983 --> 00:15:17,692
The sounds reverberate more.

It sounds somber!

I love the bass,
it resonates with my soul!

352

She made it look so easy
when she played it.

I'm not gonna let
her increase her lead.

[CHIKA]
Hey.

356
00:15:49,442 --> 00:15:50,483
Startin' today I think
we should go back

Hold on.

If you're planning to go to
Ms. Nishina's to practice more,

360
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:57,608
you two will have to take turns.

361
00:15:57,692 --> 00:15:58,275
Huh?

362
00:15:58,358 --> 00:15:59,650
Why should we?

363
00:15:59,733 --> 00:16:02,025
[TAKINAMI] Well, we borrowed
one of her 17-strings.

364
00:16:02,108 --> 00:16:04,733
Because of that, now she
only has one other bass koto

365
00:16:04,817 --> 00:16:06,400
there that she can let us use.

366
00:16:06,483 --> 00:16:08,733
So you can't practice
at the same time.

367
00:16:08,817 --> 00:16:10,108
No problem.

368
00:16:10,192 --> 00:16:12,483
We can just take this
one back and forth with us.

369
00:16:12,567 --> 00:16:15,442
[TAKINAMI] I can't let you carry
around a borrowed instrument.

370
00:16:15,525 --> 00:16:17,442
Look, it's sucks,
but you'll have to make do

371
00:16:17,525 --> 00:16:19,275
with what we have
in the time we have it.

372

Tch! There's no choice.

373
00:16:21,108 --> 00:16:23,108
Since we can't practice
together at Granny's place,

374
00:16:23,192 --> 00:16:25,317
we'll just need to find
the time somewhere else.

375

Ms. Dojima, and...

My granddaughter Akira.

You've actually met her before,

but it seems that
you've forgotten her.

Right, please forgive me.

So is there a reason
why you came back?

395
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:14,900
Did you also forget you
shamed the Hozuki name

396
00:17:14,983 --> 00:17:16,317
and were driven out?

397
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,942
No, sorry, I came here
to talk to my mother.

And what about you, Ms. Dojima,

are you practicing
at this late hour?

You don't know?

401
00:17:23,817 --> 00:17:25,317
After you left, Akira and I

402
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,567

live-in apprentices

not only did poor Chiharu
lose her husband,

407
00:17:34,775 --> 00:17:36,858
but she also lost her only heir.

408
00:17:36,942 --> 00:17:41,483
What your mother needs right now
is someone who will support her.

And, of course,

410
00:17:43,067 --> 00:17:44,483
there's the matter of finding
a new heir for the school,

411
00:17:44,567 --> 00:17:47,442
which must be
weighing on her terribly.

412

But never mind that for now,

But, in return, promise me that
you'll never come back here.

483
00:20:31,317 --> 00:20:33,067
[SATOWA]
Thank you very much.

484
00:20:37,942 --> 00:20:39,525
[SATOWA]
No matter what I'm told,

485
00:20:39,608 --> 00:20:42,900
I won't ever give up on
trying to reach Mother.

486
00:20:42,983 --> 00:20:46,108
I won't stop until my
true sound reaches her.

487
00:20:46,192 --> 00:20:47,400
Never.

488
00:20:48,567 --> 00:20:49,942
[DOJIMA]
I never imagined that Satowa

489
00:20:50,025 --> 00:20:51,733
would still be playing the koto.

490
00:20:51,817 --> 00:20:54,525
We have to ensure that there
isn't the slightest possibility

491
00:20:54,608 --> 00:20:57,150
that she can come back
to the Hozuki school.

492
00:20:57,233 --> 00:20:57,900
Right.

493
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:59,358
Akira?

494
00:20:59,442 --> 00:21:00,567
[AKIRA]
Yes.

495
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:01,983
Grandmother.

496
00:21:09,567 --> 00:21:11,692
No way!

497
00:21:11,775 --> 00:21:12,983
[SANE]
A 17-string?

498
00:21:13,067 --> 00:21:14,525
[CHIKA]
All right!

499
00:21:14,608 --> 00:21:15,358
Hey, Hozuki!

500
00:21:15,442 --> 00:21:16,692
Where'd you get this koto?

501
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:18,608
I borrowed it from
my mother's school.

502
00:21:18,692 --> 00:21:20,692
Huh? Wait. Your mom?

503
00:21:20,775 --> 00:21:22,358
[TAKEZO]
Is that okay, Hozuki?

504
00:21:22,442 --> 00:21:25,192
[HIRO]
That must've been difficult.

505
00:21:25,275 --> 00:21:27,067
It wasn't anything special.

506
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:29,067
I just borrowed an instrument.

507
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:31,067
I get it, but are you sure?

508
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:32,442
Look, that's enough about me,

509
00:21:32,525 --> 00:21:34,317
you two need
to practice together.

510
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,733
I don't want you guys
holding us back.

511
00:21:36,817 --> 00:21:38,400
Don't worry;
we'll make you proud.

512
00:21:38,483 --> 00:21:40,108
Thanks a lot, Hozuki!

513
00:21:40,192 --> 00:21:42,067
[HIRO]
Not anything special, huh?

514
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:43,650
There's no way that's true.

515
00:21:43,733 --> 00:21:46,733
Especially since that's where
she was excommunicated from.

516
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,400
[CHIKA]
Let's start practicing!

517
00:21:48,483 --> 00:21:49,483
[SANE]
Yeah!

518
00:21:51,817 --> 00:21:53,858
[SATOWA] Uh, can I help you
with something, Hiro?

519
00:21:53,942 --> 00:21:54,525
[HIRO]
Nope!

520
00:21:54,608 --> 00:21:55,983
Let's get to work!

521
00:23:28,358 --> 00:23:31,900
[AKIRA] I won't forget...
about that day.

522
00:23:31,983 --> 00:23:36,317
I'll never forget...
that performance.

523
00:23:39,317 --> 00:23:40,317
[AKIRA]
Never.

524
00:23:51,775 --> 00:23:53,942
[CHIKA] Next time:
"Their Determination."
