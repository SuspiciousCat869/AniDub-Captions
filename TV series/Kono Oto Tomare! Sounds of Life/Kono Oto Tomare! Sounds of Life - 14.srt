164
00:07:06,442 --> 00:07:08,525
You aren't worthy enough
to play the koto with Satowa,

165
00:07:08,608 --> 00:07:10,108
and you proved it out there.

166
00:07:11,525 --> 00:07:13,567
[sighs]
Same old speech, huh?

167
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:15,900
Yeah, all of our problems
today were my fault.

168
00:07:15,983 --> 00:07:17,775
And I've said this
to you several times,

169
00:07:17,858 --> 00:07:21,358
but Hozuki plays the koto
with us because she wants to.

170
00:07:21,442 --> 00:07:24,858
It's not your decision to make.

171
00:07:24,942 --> 00:07:26,192
If you're done now,

172
00:07:26,275 --> 00:07:27,775
I'm going.

173
00:07:27,858 --> 00:07:30,483
[KAZUSA]
It's your whole club's fault!

174
00:07:30,567 --> 00:07:31,900
Your performance.

175
00:07:31,983 --> 00:07:34,192
Satowa's performance.

176
00:07:34,275 --> 00:07:36,358
It...

177
00:07:36,442 --> 00:07:40,650
It wasn't how the Satowa
I know would have played!

178
00:07:40,733 --> 00:07:42,067
Huh?

179
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:43,942
[KAZUSA] Those tones, that
sound, they weren't hers!

180
00:07:44,025 --> 00:07:45,275
They used to be sharper.

181
00:07:45,358 --> 00:07:47,608
They used to be
so refined before!

182
00:07:47,692 --> 00:07:50,608
They were powerful, noble,
and definitively resonant!

183
00:07:50,692 --> 00:07:54,567
I admired her tones so much, but
you amateurs have defiled them!

184
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:56,233
You've all ruined her sound!

185
00:07:56,317 --> 00:07:59,358
Now every note she plays is
just halfhearted and shallow!

186
00:07:59,442 --> 00:08:01,317
Because she plays
with all of you.

187
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:04,442
She's not as good
as she was before!

188
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:06,192
[TAKINAMI] If you stay
in this pathetic club,

189
00:08:06,275 --> 00:08:08,525
you'll only get worse.

190
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:10,650
[SATOWA]
Why?

191
00:08:10,733 --> 00:08:14,317
Does this mean that I should be
facing the koto like I used to?

192
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,067
By screaming all by myself?

193
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:21,817
[CHIHARU] Your koto playing
feels like a weapon to me.

194
00:08:23,608 --> 00:08:25,608
[CHIKA]
They've become gentle.

195
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:31,275
It's not that they
became halfhearted

196
00:08:31,358 --> 00:08:33,733
or that she became a bad player.

197
00:08:33,817 --> 00:08:37,233
It's just that her tones
have become gentler.

198
00:08:37,317 --> 00:08:40,650
And if I had to choose between
her tones from then and now.

199
00:08:40,733 --> 00:08:42,817
I'd pick her current,
gentler sound

200
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:45,525
in a damn heartbeat.

201
00:08:59,275 --> 00:09:00,483
What do you mean?

202
00:09:00,567 --> 00:09:03,108
I'm not asking which
sound you prefer!

203
00:09:03,192 --> 00:09:04,608
You don't know
anything about tones,

204
00:09:04,692 --> 00:09:07,317
so your opinion doesn't matter!

205
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,858
[CHIKA]
They've become gentle.

206
00:09:11,733 --> 00:09:13,775
[KAZUSA]
I know. Obviously!

207
00:09:13,858 --> 00:09:18,192
You don't have to tell me,
I can hear it for myself!

208
00:09:18,275 --> 00:09:19,733
Since she was a child,

209
00:09:19,817 --> 00:09:23,358
Satowa's tones were wrapped
in a sense of solitude in a way.

210
00:09:23,442 --> 00:09:25,733
They were
irresistibly beautiful.

211
00:09:25,817 --> 00:09:28,858
So much so that
she felt unapproachable.

212
00:09:28,942 --> 00:09:33,858
To me, they were transcendent.

213
00:09:33,942 --> 00:09:35,733
But I was wrong.

214
00:09:35,817 --> 00:09:37,108
I've never heard her tones sound

215
00:09:37,192 --> 00:09:41,317
so gentle, brilliant,
fun, and happy before.

216
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:46,317
[KAZUSA]
Tones like that.

217
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:50,108
Would never have been born
had she been playing with me!

218
00:09:51,817 --> 00:09:54,567
I swear, that girl's
got zero filter.

219
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:55,358
What the--?

220
00:09:55,442 --> 00:09:56,900
You were right over here?

221
00:09:56,983 --> 00:09:58,192
For how long?

222
00:09:58,275 --> 00:10:00,983
Since the beginning
of your conversation.

223
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:02,150
So tell me.

224
00:10:02,233 --> 00:10:04,775
What exactly do you
know about my tones?

225
00:10:04,858 --> 00:10:07,108
You weren't kidding;
you heard everything, huh?

226
00:10:07,192 --> 00:10:08,358
Well, sorry, I guess.

227
00:10:08,442 --> 00:10:10,817
I was only speakin'
my damn mind.

228
00:10:17,358 --> 00:10:21,942
Tha... Thank you.

229
00:10:25,858 --> 00:10:27,608
[SATOWA]
Thank you.

230
00:10:36,442 --> 00:10:37,942
[KOTA]
Chika!

231
00:10:38,483 --> 00:10:40,233
[SANE]
There you are!

232
00:10:40,317 --> 00:10:42,817
They're for you!

233
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:43,525
Huh?

234
00:10:43,608 --> 00:10:44,650
Wha--?

235
00:10:46,067 --> 00:10:47,608
[SANE]
So how's your hand?

236
00:10:47,692 --> 00:10:49,275
Good news? Or bad?

237
00:10:49,358 --> 00:10:50,150
Wait.

238
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:51,817
I swear Hozuki was just here.

239
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:52,525
Hey!

240
00:10:52,608 --> 00:10:53,817
You already went off

241
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,650
and bought snacks
without even consulting me?

242
00:10:55,733 --> 00:10:56,567
That's not fair!

243
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:57,942
Gimme some!

244
00:10:58,025 --> 00:10:59,067
No.

245
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:00,317
Oh come on!

246
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,650
Since when did you turn
into such a greedy guy?

247
00:11:02,733 --> 00:11:04,317
[CHIKA]
Shut up.

248
00:11:14,775 --> 00:11:16,733
[ANNOUNCER]
That concludes the final piece.

249
00:11:16,817 --> 00:11:19,900
All participating high schools
have now performed.

250
00:11:19,983 --> 00:11:21,900
We've got our
work cut out for us.

251
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,483
My goodness.

252
00:11:23,567 --> 00:11:25,858
Never would've expected to see
so many high-level performances.

253
00:11:25,942 --> 00:11:27,817
[JUDGE B] I'm glad
I was here to listen to them.

254
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:28,817
I am too.

255
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,067
To the point that
partway through,

256
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:31,858
I had to ask myself if
it was really our place

257
00:11:31,942 --> 00:11:33,858
to decide who had
the best showing.

258
00:11:33,942 --> 00:11:35,983
Well, like it or not,
we're the judges.

259
00:11:36,067 --> 00:11:37,733
And there are hundreds
of children out there,

260
00:11:37,817 --> 00:11:40,817
eager to know what
decisions we'll make.

261
00:11:45,733 --> 00:11:47,900
[TAKEZO]
Kudo?

262
00:11:47,983 --> 00:11:48,942
[CHIKA]
Yeah?

263
00:11:50,442 --> 00:11:52,275
Is this guy a friend of yours?

264
00:11:52,358 --> 00:11:53,733
Never seen him before.

265
00:11:53,817 --> 00:11:54,525
Hey you.

266
00:11:54,608 --> 00:11:55,608
Tell me your name.

267
00:11:55,692 --> 00:11:57,192
Yeah, I don't think so.

268
00:11:57,275 --> 00:11:58,775
[MIO]
Then, give me your contact info.

269
00:11:58,858 --> 00:12:00,025
[CHIKA]
No thanks!

270
00:12:00,108 --> 00:12:01,358
Well, all right.

271
00:12:01,442 --> 00:12:04,025
Can I come to your
place and hang out?

272
00:12:04,108 --> 00:12:05,525
Specs, protect me!

273
00:12:05,608 --> 00:12:07,150
I'll try!

274
00:12:07,233 --> 00:12:10,608
Your tones are
quite interesting.

275
00:12:10,692 --> 00:12:11,733
Huh?

276
00:12:11,817 --> 00:12:15,150
[MIO]
Your tones, I can understand.

277
00:12:15,233 --> 00:12:16,483
It's just.

278
00:12:16,567 --> 00:12:19,317
I can see the years
of training behind them.

279
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:23,525
They're polished
and very beautiful.

280
00:12:23,608 --> 00:12:26,150
But your tones are mysterious.

281
00:12:26,233 --> 00:12:28,442
They're unrefined,
but for some reason--

282
00:12:28,525 --> 00:12:29,775
[UTA]
There you are, Mio!

283
00:12:29,858 --> 00:12:30,442
Hey.

284
00:12:30,525 --> 00:12:31,733
Stop wandering off!

285
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:34,233
Everyone's over there, let's go.

286
00:12:34,317 --> 00:12:35,400
[MIO]
No thanks.

287
00:12:35,483 --> 00:12:37,483
But you can sit here, too, Uta.

288
00:12:37,567 --> 00:12:39,358
Come on.

289
00:12:39,442 --> 00:12:41,650
[CHIKA]
What does "unrefined" mean?

290
00:12:41,733 --> 00:12:42,817
[JUDGE A]
All right.

291
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,442
Thank you all very much
for your patience.

292
00:12:44,525 --> 00:12:47,358
We will now announce the
results of today's competition.

293
00:12:47,442 --> 00:12:49,067
[KOTA]
I'm so nervous.

294
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:50,858
Can't I just,
not hear the results?

295
00:12:50,942 --> 00:12:51,900
Stop it, Kota.

296
00:12:51,983 --> 00:12:52,983
I don't wanna catch your nerves!

297
00:12:53,067 --> 00:12:54,442
You're unbelievably pathetic.

298
00:12:54,525 --> 00:12:57,858
Real men remain calm
in the face of uncertainty!

299
00:12:57,942 --> 00:12:58,692
Yo pup.

300
00:12:58,775 --> 00:12:59,900
Someone rubbin' your belly?

301
00:12:59,983 --> 00:13:00,733
Shut your mouth!

302
00:13:00,817 --> 00:13:02,400
You pickin' a fight with me?

303
00:13:02,483 --> 00:13:04,317
[JUDGE A] We've
heard several high-level,

304
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,150
memorable performances
here today.

305
00:13:07,233 --> 00:13:10,192
It has truly been
an incredible competition.

306
00:13:10,275 --> 00:13:11,900
Judging was not an easy task,

307
00:13:11,983 --> 00:13:14,817
especially the best
performance award.

308
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:17,900
But I'm sure you'd all like
to hear the winners now.

309
00:13:17,983 --> 00:13:20,067
So without further ado.

310
00:13:25,192 --> 00:13:28,525
First, I'll announce the
seven schools out of all 33.

311
00:13:28,608 --> 00:13:29,733
One from each prefecture,

312
00:13:29,817 --> 00:13:32,358
to win the outstanding
performance award.

313
00:13:32,442 --> 00:13:34,317
Then I'll announce the
school that won first place,

314
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:37,983
the best performance award,
out of those seven.

315
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:41,067
The first outstanding
performance award is for Tokyo,

316
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:44,942
which goes to
Meiryo High School.

317
00:13:46,275 --> 00:13:48,317
[OUSUKE]
That's a relief.

318
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,483
[ASANO]
Ousuke.

319
00:13:49,567 --> 00:13:50,942
We did it!

320
00:13:53,858 --> 00:13:57,608
[JUDGE A] Next up is Ibaraki
prefecture, which goes to

321
00:13:57,692 --> 00:13:59,650
Eidai Fuzoku High School.

322
00:13:59,733 --> 00:14:01,733
All right!

323
00:14:01,817 --> 00:14:05,233
Aww! Sen, we actually did it!

324
00:14:05,317 --> 00:14:06,442
Did you hear that?

325
00:14:06,525 --> 00:14:08,192
We're the best
in our prefecture!

326
00:14:08,275 --> 00:14:11,317
Don't get cocky just
'cause your club's got girls!

327
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,775
[HARU]
Hey, Sen...

328
00:14:14,317 --> 00:14:17,608
Man, how embarrassing
can you get?

329
00:14:17,692 --> 00:14:19,650
Oh man, my heart
is pounding so hard.

330
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:22,275
It's giving me a case
of the trembly wiggles!

331
00:14:22,358 --> 00:14:23,525
I can't breathe.

332
00:14:25,358 --> 00:14:27,525
[KOTA]
I hope we get chosen.

333
00:14:29,525 --> 00:14:30,817
[HIRO]
I'm so anxious.

334
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,275
[JUDGE A]
For Saitama, the award...

335
00:14:32,358 --> 00:14:34,233
This is so nerve-racking, Mio!

336
00:14:34,317 --> 00:14:35,775
Not for me.

337
00:14:35,858 --> 00:14:37,192
[KAZUSA]
We won't lose.

338
00:14:37,275 --> 00:14:38,900
I don't want to lose.

339
00:14:38,983 --> 00:14:40,400
Not to Tokise.

340
00:14:40,483 --> 00:14:42,317
[FUMI]
It'll be fine.

341
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,983
We're gonna win this.

342
00:14:44,067 --> 00:14:45,983
[KAZUSA]
You think so, Fumi?

343
00:14:47,525 --> 00:14:49,150
Yeah, you're right.

344
00:14:49,233 --> 00:14:52,817
[JUDGE A] And last
but not least is Kanagawa.

345
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:55,608
[SATOWA] I'm more nervous
than when I'm by myself.

346
00:14:55,692 --> 00:14:59,233
[TAKEZO]
We did everything we could do!

347
00:15:00,692 --> 00:15:02,692
[JUDGE A]
The award goes to...

348
00:15:06,108 --> 00:15:08,317
[JUDGE A]
...Kanagawa Prefectural...

349
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,983
[JUDGE A]
...Hakuto High School.

350
00:15:16,567 --> 00:15:17,650
Wha...?

351
00:15:20,567 --> 00:15:23,067
[TAKEZO]
Haku... to?

352
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:25,108
[CHIKA] What about the
school going after us, then?

353
00:15:25,192 --> 00:15:26,692
Says it right here!

354
00:15:26,775 --> 00:15:30,817
[TAKEZO] They're the school
that played right after we did!

355
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:34,817
We did it, Mio! We're the
best in our prefecture!

356
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,317
How about now?

357
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:40,483
Do you feel like
telling me your name yet?

358
00:15:45,442 --> 00:15:46,775
We didn't win.

359
00:15:46,858 --> 00:15:47,983
What's that?

360
00:15:48,067 --> 00:15:49,233
You guys didn't place?
That's pretty lame!

361
00:15:49,317 --> 00:15:50,858
Sen! Now's not the time!

362
00:15:50,942 --> 00:15:53,817
Huh? Uh, sorry.

363
00:15:56,817 --> 00:15:59,275
[TAKINAMI] Well.
What else could you expect?

364
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:02,317
You can't win a competition
after a mistake like that.

365
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,025
[OUSUKE]
Hakuto High School.

366
00:16:04,108 --> 00:16:07,483
It's the school that
performed right after Tokise.

367
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:10,525
Well, I shouldn't be surprised.

368
00:16:10,608 --> 00:16:14,317
With the kind of
performance they gave.

369
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,608
[KAZUSA]
What?

370
00:16:15,692 --> 00:16:17,442
What just happened?

371
00:16:17,525 --> 00:16:19,733
Hakuto?

372
00:16:19,817 --> 00:16:21,400
Who's that?

373
00:16:21,483 --> 00:16:24,650
How could we lose
to an unknown school?

374
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:26,942
[JUDGE A] And as for the
best performance award,

375
00:16:27,025 --> 00:16:30,275
we'll be giving it
to two schools.

376
00:16:30,358 --> 00:16:33,900
Tokyo's winner,
Meiryo High School.

377
00:16:33,983 --> 00:16:37,817
And Kanagawa's winner,
Hakuto High School.

378
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,233
I know this is unusual,

379
00:16:39,317 --> 00:16:42,817
but both schools were
equally excellent today,

380
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,900
so we'd like to give the
best performance award

381
00:16:44,983 --> 00:16:47,358
to both of them.

382
00:16:47,442 --> 00:16:49,942
No way! We got first?

383
00:16:50,775 --> 00:16:53,567
[OUSUKE]
Tied with us, huh?

384
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:55,858
[JUDGE A] We'll now
start the award ceremony.

385
00:16:55,942 --> 00:16:57,108
Those who are
receiving the award...

386
00:16:57,192 --> 00:17:00,150
[KAZUSA]
No. This can't be happening.

387
00:17:00,233 --> 00:17:04,150
Himesaka has been the best
in Kanagawa for so long.

388
00:17:07,442 --> 00:17:09,442
It's okay.

389
00:17:09,942 --> 00:17:13,067
Yeah?

390
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:18,108
[sobs]

391
00:17:28,692 --> 00:17:30,608
[CHIKA]
What's going on?

392
00:17:30,692 --> 00:17:37,442
The back of my throat kinda
hurts, and it's hard to breathe.

393
00:17:37,525 --> 00:17:40,900
My body feels so damn hot.

394
00:17:40,983 --> 00:17:43,067
Like it's burning.

395
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,983
[ISAKI] Takaoka, do you
wanna talk to the crew

396
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:49,067
before you leave?

397
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:51,192
No, I think I'm
just gonna head home.

398
00:17:51,275 --> 00:17:53,692
They probably wouldn't
wanna talk right now anyway.

399
00:17:53,775 --> 00:17:56,233
You're being dramatic;
they wouldn't mind.

400
00:17:56,317 --> 00:17:57,942
But that's fine, let's go.

401
00:17:58,025 --> 00:17:59,067
I'll drive you.

402
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:01,108
Appreciate the offer,
but I'm good.

403
00:18:01,192 --> 00:18:02,317
[ISAKI]
Really, it's no trouble.

404
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,733
[TETSUKI]
I said I'm good.

405
00:18:03,817 --> 00:18:05,192
What are you doin', Haru?

406
00:18:05,275 --> 00:18:06,775
Let's get goin'.

407
00:18:06,858 --> 00:18:09,317
Sorry, I was just trying to see
if I could find that one club.

408
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,025
You mean the guys from Tokise?

409
00:18:11,108 --> 00:18:12,317
Yeah, those guys.

410
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,692
I thought it might
be nice for us

411
00:18:13,775 --> 00:18:15,483
to try and make
friends with them.

412
00:18:15,567 --> 00:18:16,275
Come on!

413
00:18:16,358 --> 00:18:18,233
Don't be ridiculous, man!

414
00:18:18,317 --> 00:18:20,983
We'll see them again anyway.

415
00:18:21,067 --> 00:18:22,900
As long as we all keep playing.

416
00:18:22,983 --> 00:18:24,192
Guess you're right.

417
00:18:24,275 --> 00:18:26,442
Enough about that,
let's get home and practice!

418
00:18:26,525 --> 00:18:28,817
We don't have the luxury
of taking any breaks.

419
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:29,900
Dammit!

420
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:31,233
We couldn't even
get first place in Kanto

421
00:18:31,317 --> 00:18:33,483
when we're aiming to be
number one in the country!

422
00:18:33,567 --> 00:18:35,983
We'll definitely
win first next time!

423
00:18:37,067 --> 00:18:39,942
[FUMI]
Do you feel any calmer now?

424
00:18:40,025 --> 00:18:41,775
Yeah, I'm okay.

425
00:18:47,233 --> 00:18:48,275
'Cause the truth is,

426
00:18:48,358 --> 00:18:50,692
this will only make us stronger.

427
00:18:57,108 --> 00:18:58,108
Hey, Mio!

428
00:18:58,192 --> 00:19:00,150
Where do you think
you're going, huh?

429
00:19:03,233 --> 00:19:04,275
[OUSUKE]
Looks like things

430
00:19:04,358 --> 00:19:06,025
are getting more and
more interesting.

431
00:19:14,442 --> 00:19:15,733
Hey, guys?

432
00:19:15,817 --> 00:19:18,358
Heh. We all knew it wouldn't
be that easy to place,

433
00:19:18,442 --> 00:19:19,525
so I'm not surprised.

434
00:19:19,608 --> 00:19:20,983
Yeah, you said it, man.

435
00:19:21,067 --> 00:19:22,650
I do think we worked
pretty dang hard,

436
00:19:22,733 --> 00:19:25,025
but in the end,
we were too optimistic.

437
00:19:25,108 --> 00:19:27,025
Sure, but I know
I could have practiced

438
00:19:27,108 --> 00:19:28,733
a lot harder than I did.

439
00:19:28,817 --> 00:19:32,442
Funny to think we had been
talking about nationals before.

440
00:19:32,525 --> 00:19:33,817
I feel pretty damn embarrassed--

441
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,317
It's not embarrassing!

442
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,858
Nothing about this
is embarrassing!

443
00:19:39,983 --> 00:19:42,692
[TAKEZO] Obviously today
didn't go the way we wanted.

444
00:19:42,775 --> 00:19:44,358
But we still performed
the best that we could

445
00:19:44,442 --> 00:19:45,900
at this point in time.

446
00:19:45,983 --> 00:19:47,608
I can't think of a
single reason for us

447
00:19:47,692 --> 00:19:50,608
to be so hard on
ourselves, can you?

448
00:19:50,692 --> 00:19:53,442
I dunno, Takezo.

449
00:19:54,275 --> 00:19:55,567
[TAKEZO]
It's not working.

450
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:57,442
My words aren't enough.

451
00:19:57,525 --> 00:19:59,983
I mean everything
I've said, but...

452
00:20:00,067 --> 00:20:01,400
...I lost too.

453
00:20:01,483 --> 00:20:03,983
So they probably think
I'm just trying to fool myself.

454
00:20:04,067 --> 00:20:07,692
[TAKINAMI] Stop looking
so miserable already.

455
00:20:07,775 --> 00:20:08,817
Mr. Takinami.

456
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,317
What did you expect?

457
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,692
You guys messed up
during your one performance.

458
00:20:12,775 --> 00:20:14,775
You can't win like that.

459
00:20:14,858 --> 00:20:16,150
[TAKEZO] Why do you
always have to do this?!

460
00:20:16,233 --> 00:20:19,025
But, honestly, I never
thought that Mizuhara

461
00:20:19,108 --> 00:20:22,442
would be the trigger to
you guys making a comeback.

462
00:20:22,525 --> 00:20:25,150
Didn't expect Kudo
to play injured either.

463
00:20:25,233 --> 00:20:27,192
Or, that you guys
could rebound together

464
00:20:27,275 --> 00:20:30,233
so well in the first place.

465
00:20:30,317 --> 00:20:32,067
But it makes sense.

466
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:35,108
You didn't give your
best performance today.

467
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:38,483
It was better than your best.

468
00:20:38,567 --> 00:20:39,900
[TAKEZO]
What?

469
00:20:39,983 --> 00:20:41,483
[TAKINAMI]
Hmph.

470
00:20:41,567 --> 00:20:42,692
You did well, guys.

471
00:20:42,775 --> 00:20:44,275
I really liked your performance.

472
00:20:44,358 --> 00:20:46,983
It was actually a
pretty damn good one.

473
00:20:47,067 --> 00:20:50,358
And now I know that
you can become even better.

474
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:53,733
Is that how you see it?

475
00:20:53,817 --> 00:20:55,525
I don't put that
much thought into it,

476
00:20:55,608 --> 00:20:58,192
only say what's on my mind.

477
00:20:58,275 --> 00:21:05,275
[sobbing]

478
00:21:05,358 --> 00:21:08,942
[cries]
Aw, man! Everything sucks!

479
00:21:09,025 --> 00:21:09,900
We'll win.

480
00:21:09,983 --> 00:21:11,817
Next time, for sure!

481
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:12,900
I'll be better.

482
00:21:12,983 --> 00:21:14,692
I'll practice a
hundred times harder!

483
00:21:14,775 --> 00:21:16,525
And I'll get so much better!

484
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:17,900
And I swear,

485
00:21:17,983 --> 00:21:20,192
I'll start putting my heart
into practice even more!

486
00:21:20,275 --> 00:21:23,442
[CHIKA] The next competition is
the national qualifier, right?

487
00:21:25,817 --> 00:21:28,358
We're gonna qualify.

488
00:21:28,442 --> 00:21:30,608
Hear me?

489
00:21:37,483 --> 00:21:39,067
Let's go to nationals.

490
00:21:43,567 --> 00:21:44,567
Agreed.

491
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:45,650
Same here.

492
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:48,483
[SANE] All right!
Let's make it happen!

493
00:21:48,567 --> 00:21:52,150
Yeah yeah, we get it.
Good luck. Let's go already.

494
00:21:52,233 --> 00:21:53,525
Well, this is new.

495
00:21:53,608 --> 00:21:56,483
So nationals aren't a
"pipe dream" anymore, then?

496
00:21:56,567 --> 00:21:59,442
I don't say things
that I don't believe.

497
00:23:51,525 --> 00:23:53,817
[CHIKA]
Next time, "Becoming Aware."
