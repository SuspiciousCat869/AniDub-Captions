[DETECTIVE A sighs]
What a nightmare.

3
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:25,192
And they think
the grandson did it?

00:00:25,234 --> 00:00:25,943
[DETECTIVE B]
Yes.

5
00:00:25,984 --> 00:00:27,569
So we were told.

00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:30,906
[TAKEZO]
That place...

7
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:36,703
[TAKEZO]
...was invaluable and precious.

[COP C]
Hey, there he is!

9
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,128
It's been fun, Takezo.

00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:46,129
The club's yours.

11
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:47,589
You've got this.

You'll be fine!

Whoa.

Check it out, isn't
that guy over there Kudo?

16
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:35,405
Like Chika Kudo
from Nishi Middle School?

17
00:02:35,447 --> 00:02:37,491
That dude's bad news.

All right. Looks good! Next up‐‐

00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:50,337

Huh? Principal!

22
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,174
What're you up to?

00:02:54,216 --> 00:02:55,050
Recruitment?

24
00:02:55,092 --> 00:02:56,677
[TAKEZO]
Uh, yeah.

25
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:58,804
You see, since the
upperclassmen have graduated,

26
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:00,347
I'm all that's left.

27
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:03,975
And if I can't find some new
members, we'll have to disband.

00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,477
[PRINCIPAL]
Is that so?

29
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,771
This club's been around a while.

30
00:03:07,813 --> 00:03:11,108
In fact, it was actually founded
by an old friend of mine.

31
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:13,652
I would hate
to see it get shut down.

Good luck in your endeavors.

Right. I'll do my best, sir.

be good enough.

[TAKEZO] But it's reserved
for the koto club.

48
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:52,858
I'm going to have
to ask you to please leave.

49
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:55,277
We have new students that
might be coming to look around.

Jeez, learn how to
pick your battles, bro.

56
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:11,293
Not even the teachers
care about this stupid club.

Yeah, no one gives a damn

That's why.

Shut up.

sure you never play again.

I'm actually the

Get it? I'm joining
the club, specs.

Uh. Um, I'm sorry.

I think you're confused.

107
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:51,393
We're the koto club.

108
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:53,728
What the hell?
This room is a disaster!

109
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,230
It looks like a dumpster!

00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:57,399
I'll have you know
I clean it up every day!

00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,734
Yeah, right!
I'm firing you as president!

112
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:01,319
From now on, I'm the president!

113
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,280
You can't just vote yourself in!

114
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:12,414
Look, I don't know
what your problem is.

115
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:14,708
But I can't accept this.

116
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:15,959
Please leave!

117
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:18,628
This room isn't a hangout
for punks like you!

118
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,548
Like he'd really
want to join up.

119
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:23,091
I'm not stupid!

120
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:25,385
Huh?

121
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:27,262
What is this crap?

122
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:33,393
He...

123
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:35,478
He took my sign?!

124
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:41,610
[TAKEZO]
What should I do?

125
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:44,237
I don't want to let
the upperclassmen down.

126
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:45,822
This is terrible.

127
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:47,282
[TAKERU]
Why was Takezo late?

128
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:48,992
[TAKEZO'S MOM]
He had club things.

129
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:50,493
Oh, the koto club?

130
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:52,787
So he still does that stuff.

131
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:54,414
I thought it was just
a desperate cry for help

132
00:06:54,456 --> 00:06:56,499
after he bombed his exams.

133
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,210
[TAKEZO'S RELATIVE]
Takezo didn't get into

134
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,795
Meiryo High School?

135
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:02,005
[TAKEZO'S MOM]
I'm afraid not.

136
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:04,215
His stomach was
upset during the test.

137
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,468
[TAKEZO'S RELATIVE]
But he had the grades to pass!

138
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:07,385
[TAKERU]
No surprise,

139
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,971
Takezo always screws up
when it matters.

140
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:10,972
[TAKEZO]
He was right.

141
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:13,058
I hated myself for failing.

142
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:15,435
I was feeling pretty lost.

143
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:16,436
But then...

144
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:17,854
[STUDENT F]
Okay, next up.

145
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:19,606
We have the koto club.

146
00:07:19,648 --> 00:07:21,107
[TAKEZO]
The koto?

147
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:22,400
I hate to say it,

148
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,986
but that sounds
boring even to me.

149
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:27,364
I feel bad for them.

150
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:33,620
[TAKEZO] Watching this club is
kind of like watching myself.

151
00:07:33,662 --> 00:07:35,246
They probably wish they
could stop the performance

152
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:36,998
and run away.

153
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:42,712
Hello?

00:07:42,754 --> 00:07:44,089
Hey! Wanna join?

155
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,674
Not exactly.

00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:47,550
I mean...

157
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:50,428
[TAKEZO]
Yes.

158
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:53,682
I ended up joining
without even thinking.

159
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:54,933
Why?

160
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:57,394
[MASHIRO]
Thanks for signing up, Takezo.

161
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:00,271
[TAKEZO]
You wanna teach me a new song?

162
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:01,064
Really?

163
00:08:01,106 --> 00:08:03,358
But it's so late in the year.

164
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,901
[MASHIRO] It's a song
that's been taught here

165
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:06,861
for generations.

166
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:08,196
I'm relieved.

167
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:12,200
If you know the song, you'll be
able to continue the tradition.

168
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:14,411
It's a good thing you joined.

169

I'm really glad you're here.

170
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:22,669
Hey. About the club sign,
please give it back!

171
00:08:22,711 --> 00:08:24,212
Denied.

172
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:25,380
Just hear me out!

173
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:28,008
It's for the club, that sign
is very important to me!

174
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:31,177
Look, dude, I ain't
givin' shit back to you.

175
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:33,555
It didn't look like
you cared about it.

176
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:35,265
What a joke.

177
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:39,853
[TAKEZO]
What's his problem?

178
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:42,355
And what's the point
of even taking the sign?

179
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:44,691
He has no idea
what I care about!

180
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:49,863
[CHIKA]
What the hell, you again?

181
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:50,905
Get lost.

182
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:52,490
Where'd all their stuff go?

183
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:53,199
Dumpster.

184
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:54,159
You threw it out?

185
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,785
Yeah, it's trash.

186
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:57,620
Wait. Did you throw
out the instruments too?

187
00:08:57,662 --> 00:09:00,999
Why do you even wear glasses
if you don't use 'em for seein'?

188
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,792
Ahh! My neck!

189
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:05,503
[CHIKA] Idiot, I told you
I'm joinin' the koto club.

190
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:08,381
Why would I throw out
the instruments?

191
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:09,507
Heads up.

192
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:12,260
Be a dear and
take out the trash.

193
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:13,428
Hey, why should I?

194
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:15,430
The sign!

195
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:18,516
[TAKEZO]
That jerk.

196
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,810
He sure likes
bossing people around.

197
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:23,605
[CHIKA] Idiot, I told you
I'm joining the koto club.

198
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:24,564
[TAKEZO]
Yeah, right.

199
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:27,275
Why would a creep like him
want to play the koto anyway?

200
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:29,319
[DELINQUENT A]
Oh look, it's the wuss!

[gasps]

202
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:30,987
[DELINQUENT A]
What?

203
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:33,031
I guess you're
Kudo's errand boy now?

204
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:33,990
What? No!

205
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:35,658
He stood up for you yesterday.

206
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,243
I guess you got a protector?

207
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:39,537
No. That's crazy.
I don't even really know him!

208
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:42,165
Don't talk back to me!

209
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:44,417
[CHIKA] I thought I told you
to take out the trash.

210
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:45,460
Not play with it.

211
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:47,045
[DELINQUENT A]
Kudo!

212
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:50,006
Hey. Did this loser
throw the first punch?

213
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:50,840
Um, yeah.

214
00:09:50,882 --> 00:09:51,883
That's perfect.

215
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:53,718
Because now it's self‐defense!

216
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,844
[TAKEZO]
Don't do it!

What?! I'm just tryin' to
help you out, four‐eyes!

Well, it doesn't concern you!

219
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:00,850
[CHIKA]
That's bullshit.

220
00:10:00,892 --> 00:10:02,852
It concerns everybody.

221
00:10:02,894 --> 00:10:04,479
If nobody stops guys like that,

222
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:06,356
then they just do
whatever they want.

223
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:08,399
What's the difference
between you and them?

224
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,652
The only thing I want
is to protect the club!

225
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:12,862
That's rich.
You're not protecting anything!

226
00:10:12,904 --> 00:10:15,198
Maybe protect is code
for do nothing.

227
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,325
That's why you get
beaten up so much.

It's not like you're any better!

You go around doing
whatever you please!

Why are you doing this?

231
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:25,667
To ruin the koto club?

232
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:26,835
[CHIKA]
You serious?

233
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:29,838
I already said I wanted to join.

00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:35,176
I'm sorry, but I just
don't believe you.

00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:43,518
Of course.

236
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:58,700
[TAKEZO] I don't get it.
He just did a 180.

237
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:00,785
Now I feel like the bad guy.

[TAKEZO gasps]

sloppiness is this?

00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:10,336
It's not like you're any better!

241

[TETSUKI]
Chika?

00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:17,051
Sorry, but I don't
think he's here yet.

00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:18,178
I see.

244
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:20,555
[TETSUKI] Let me guess,
he did something stupid again?

245
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:21,514
Uh, no.

246
00:11:21,556 --> 00:11:22,765
It wasn't Kudo.

247
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:24,475
It was me.

248
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:25,727
[TETSUKI]
Hmm...

249
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:28,396
Listen. Can we talk
for a second?

250
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:32,150
Dammit. That Kudo's
a real piece of work.

251
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:33,943
[DELINQUENT A]
So, let's get rid of 'im.

252
00:11:33,985 --> 00:11:36,613
I've got a great idea
that just might work.

253
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:38,740
Heh, sounds good.
What's the plan?

254
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:41,701
He's already
been in trouble once.

255
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:44,913
It won't be hard to make him
look like the bad guy again.

256
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:49,250
Oh no. That troublesome
boy is back again.

257
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:51,461
He always comes on the same day.

258
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:54,380
Maybe he's trying to repent.

259
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,550
[TETSUKI]
Let's see, where do I start?

260
00:11:57,592 --> 00:11:59,344
I guess you should know
it was his grandpa

261
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:01,638
who introduced him to the koto.

262
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:02,555
You see.

263
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:03,890
In his third year
of middle school,

264
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:05,892
Chika started living
with his grandpa,

265
00:12:05,934 --> 00:12:09,520
and his grandfather was
a professional koto maker.

266
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:12,815
[TAKEZO gasps]
Wow, really?

267
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:14,150
[TETSUKI]
To be honest,

268
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:16,736
the Chika you know now
is actually pretty chill.

269
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:19,239
But in middle school
he was a loose cannon,

270
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:22,575
and he fought with
his grandpa constantly.

271
00:12:22,617 --> 00:12:25,787
And, while I don't
know all the details,

272
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:28,248

had a lot goin' on.

That performance will
absolutely change your world.

Okay, then.

Put this on your finger.

332
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:48,930
[TETSUKI] I think that was
the moment that changed them,

333

and they stopped
fighting so much.

334
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:53,393
Chika quit spending time
with those punks.

335
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:56,354
But then, I guess they
thought he'd gotten boring.

336
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:58,856
Maybe that he thought
he was better than they were.

337
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:02,944
That's when they attacked
his grandpa's place.

338
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,613
They dressed up like Chika

339
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:08,825
and waited for
his grandfather to leave.

Everything was destroyed.

[TAKEZO] Wait, is that...
why he got arrested?

[TETSUKI] Naturally,
he was the prime suspect.

343
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,797
His grandpa collapsed
that same night

344
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:25,258
and then passed away
a few days later.

Oh. Sorry to hear that.

It was rough.

I think the old guy might
have been sick for a while.

Listen.

349
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:37,353
The reason he's set
on joining the koto club.

350
00:15:37,395 --> 00:15:41,816
Is because his grandfather
was the one who founded it.

[TAKEZO]
Kudo was being honest.

00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:14,231
Uh, I just wanted
to say thank you.

483
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:18,235
That was so polite!

484
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:19,612
Shut up! No, it wasn't!

485
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:22,448
[TAKEZO shrieks]
Still though,

486
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:24,408
I don't understand
why the attackers

487
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:25,868
would give themselves up.

488
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:28,412
Who the hell knows. Huh.

489
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:30,247
Maybe an annoying guy who
doesn't know how to mind

490
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,666
his own business talked to 'em.

491
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:36,420
Where are you going?

492
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:38,798
The gate's that way.

493
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:40,299
[CHIKA]
To the club room.

494
00:21:40,341 --> 00:21:41,801
It's still trashed.

495
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:44,220
So it's gotta be cleaned again.

496
00:21:46,347 --> 00:21:48,057
[chuckles]

497
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:49,809
[MASHIRO]
You'll be fine!

498
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,560
It's you after all!

499
00:21:51,602 --> 00:21:54,772
It'll be the best
koto club ever.

500
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:56,774
I believe in you!

501
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:58,067
[TAKEZO]
Everyone,

502
00:21:58,108 --> 00:21:59,944
he's a lot to deal with.

503
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:03,489
But somehow we just gained
our strongest recruit yet.

504
00:22:03,531 --> 00:22:04,949
Uh. Hey, Kudo?

505
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,242
Thanks for the sign.

506
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:06,951
It's great.

507
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:08,494
Huh? Whaddaya mean?

508
00:22:08,536 --> 00:22:09,203
What sign?

509
00:22:09,245 --> 00:22:10,287
[TAKEZO]
What are you denying it?

510
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:11,831
Wait, are you blushing?

511
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:12,832
[CHIKA]
Shut up!

512
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:15,584
I don't need your
dumb compliments, nerd!

513
00:23:57,186 --> 00:23:59,855
[CHIKA] Next time,
"Havin' What it Takes."
