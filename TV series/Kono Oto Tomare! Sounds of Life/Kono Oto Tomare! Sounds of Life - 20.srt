Let's practice separately.

123
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:39,775
We can start by pairing the
solo and the 17 string.

124
00:07:39,858 --> 00:07:42,108
In this piece,
the 17 string serves

125
00:07:42,192 --> 00:07:44,817
as the foundation and
the solo is the key.

126
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:47,358
For this to work, we must
first form a consistent

127

core with these
two parts together.

17 string and the solo as the

131

"root" and the
"trunk" of a tree.

132
00:07:57,775 --> 00:07:59,567
Then the first and
second kotos are leaves

133
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:02,067
and blossoms that
lend color to it.

Depending on how the
first and second kotos

are played together,

piece changes quite a bit.

137

The first and second koto
parts chase each other

138
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:10,775
and have a lot of interplay,

139

practice together.

But it's fun. We enjoy it.

314
00:17:13,025 --> 00:17:16,067
You must love the koto to
dedicate yourself like that.

315
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:20,567
[TAKEZO] Hm. Sure, but you
love it too, right?

316
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:22,942
[AKIRA gasps]

317
00:17:23,025 --> 00:17:27,358
[DOJIMA] Welcome home, Akira.
How are things at the club?

318
00:17:27,442 --> 00:17:28,983
Do you think those
little brats are ready

319
00:17:29,067 --> 00:17:31,108
to throw in the towel, yet?

320
00:17:31,192 --> 00:17:32,942
I researched that
club a bit today,

321
00:17:33,025 --> 00:17:35,192
and I discovered that they're
pretty low-ranked in the big

322
00:17:35,275 --> 00:17:39,733
scheme of things. It's nothing
but delinquents. Shameful.

323
00:17:39,817 --> 00:17:41,442
I doubt that any of
the kids in the club

324
00:17:41,525 --> 00:17:43,692
are truly serious
about the koto.

325
00:17:43,775 --> 00:17:44,900
[AKIRA gasps]

326
00:17:44,983 --> 00:17:46,317
[DOJIMA] That Hozuki
girl hanging out with

327
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,275
a shady crowd like that!
She sure has hit rock bottom.

328
00:17:50,358 --> 00:17:52,442
Wouldn't you agree?

329
00:17:52,525 --> 00:17:53,608
Akira!

330
00:17:56,692 --> 00:17:58,525
Please forgive
my weariness, Grandmother.

331
00:17:58,608 --> 00:18:00,400
This day has been rather
long and exhausting,

332
00:18:00,483 --> 00:18:02,775
may I please excuse
myself for the night?

333
00:18:02,858 --> 00:18:04,317
Of course you may.

334
00:18:11,233 --> 00:18:12,358
[DOJIMA]
Huh...

335
00:18:13,817 --> 00:18:15,650
[ISAKI]
Jeez, Chika!

336
00:18:15,733 --> 00:18:18,233
What have I said about
sleeping on the couch?

337
00:18:18,317 --> 00:18:19,608
Can you hear me?

338
00:18:19,692 --> 00:18:21,900
You're gonna get sick--

339
00:18:21,983 --> 00:18:24,608
Oh, you're awake.
What are you listening to?

340
00:18:24,692 --> 00:18:26,692
My own performance.

341
00:18:26,775 --> 00:18:30,358
Hey, Isaki. Is there something
you think that I lack?

342
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:34,233
What? I think the bigger
question is what don't you lack?

343
00:18:34,317 --> 00:18:35,608
Oh. Besides sugar,

344
00:18:35,692 --> 00:18:37,400
you definitely eat
of plenty of that.

345
00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:38,650
[CHIKA]
You're such a jerk.

346
00:18:38,733 --> 00:18:41,317
[ISAKI laughs]
Come on, I'm teasing.

347
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,525
[CHIKA]
Okay, hag.

348
00:18:42,608 --> 00:18:43,942
[ISAKI gasps]
How dare you call me a hag!

349
00:18:44,025 --> 00:18:45,733
[CHIKA] So when Hozuki
plays with someone

350
00:18:45,817 --> 00:18:49,900
on the same skill level as her,
it sounds like that, huh?

351
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:53,692
It was really good. It seemed
like she was having an easy time

352
00:18:53,775 --> 00:18:56,858
playing and her performance
was better than usual.

353
00:18:57,983 --> 00:19:00,733
[TAKINAMI] Think about what your
sound means and its role.

354
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:15,192
[AKIRA] You must love the koto
to dedicate yourself like that.

355
00:19:17,067 --> 00:19:19,400
[TAKEZO] Sure, but you
love it too, right?

356
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,317
[AKIRA]
Excuse me.

357
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,983
[TAKINAMI]
Miss Dojima?

358
00:19:24,067 --> 00:19:26,192
I thought you didn't
have a lesson today.

359
00:19:26,275 --> 00:19:28,942
Oh, I don't, I just
wanted to talk to you.

360
00:19:29,025 --> 00:19:30,108
What about?

361
00:19:30,192 --> 00:19:31,942
Actually, before we
get into that part,

362
00:19:32,025 --> 00:19:34,442
I'd like to ask you an
important question first.

363
00:19:34,525 --> 00:19:36,192
Oh, and what's that?

364
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:37,983
Well, I was wondering.

365
00:19:38,067 --> 00:19:41,358
Just how serious are you about
aiming for nationals this year?

366
00:19:41,442 --> 00:19:42,900
[gasps]

367
00:19:42,983 --> 00:19:46,358
[AKIRA] When you and I first
met, I thought you were serious.

368
00:19:46,442 --> 00:19:49,358
But you don't come to
see the practices at all.

369
00:19:49,442 --> 00:19:53,358
Then yesterday, you show up
and start giving them advice.

370
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:55,567
Is this all just a game to you?

371
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:56,858
Well, for the record,

372
00:19:56,942 --> 00:19:59,067
I couldn't care less what
you think about me.

373
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:01,233
But I'm very serious.

374
00:20:01,317 --> 00:20:03,900
There's not much I can do when
you guys are just practicing.

375
00:20:03,983 --> 00:20:06,817
That's why I decided to
let you handle the basics.

376
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,400
[AKIRA]
Let me handle it?

377
00:20:08,483 --> 00:20:10,067
Did you have any
problems teaching them

378
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:13,108
without me in the room?
Or do you need my supervision?

379
00:20:13,192 --> 00:20:15,067
[AKIRA]
That's not what I meant,

380
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:16,775
but you're entrusting
your students

381
00:20:16,858 --> 00:20:19,650
with a complete stranger.
And that's why I'm asking!

382
00:20:19,733 --> 00:20:21,108
Two years.

383
00:20:21,192 --> 00:20:21,983
[AKIRA gasps]

384
00:20:22,067 --> 00:20:23,525
[TAKINAMI]
For two years,

385
00:20:23,608 --> 00:20:27,608
you've seriously faced a single
piece and produced a result.

386
00:20:27,692 --> 00:20:29,817
You even told me I had
permission to fire you

387
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:32,358
if I decided you
weren't good enough.

388
00:20:32,442 --> 00:20:34,358
With that kind of resolution,

389
00:20:34,442 --> 00:20:37,608
I felt like you
were trustworthy.

390
00:20:37,692 --> 00:20:40,358
[gasps]

391
00:20:40,442 --> 00:20:42,025
[TAKINAMI]
Does that answer your question?

392
00:20:42,108 --> 00:20:44,942
Excuse me, I have
a class to teach.

393
00:20:45,025 --> 00:20:47,525
[AKIRA] Hold on!
I want to keep helping!

394
00:20:48,983 --> 00:20:50,358
[TAKINAMI grunts]

395
00:20:50,442 --> 00:20:52,358
[AKIRA]
I'm sorry.

396
00:20:52,442 --> 00:20:55,233
I know yesterday I said
I was going to quit,

397
00:20:55,317 --> 00:20:58,233
and I don't want to cause
you any more trouble.

398
00:20:58,317 --> 00:21:01,525
I'm worried I won't be good
enough to teach them.

399
00:21:01,608 --> 00:21:04,025
But I promise you,
I'll do my best.

400
00:21:04,108 --> 00:21:06,358
So please let me
continue to help!

401
00:21:14,067 --> 00:21:16,400
[gasps]

402
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:17,608
[TAKINAMI]
Hm.

403
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:26,942
We would be honored
to have you.

404
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,608
[AKIRA]
It wasn't a waste of time.

405
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:39,275
[AKIRA] I spent two years
facing that piece,

406
00:21:39,358 --> 00:21:42,317
and it's giving me the power
to stand here right now.

407
00:21:43,567 --> 00:21:45,858
[AKIRA]
It was never a waste of time.

408
00:21:47,317 --> 00:21:50,442
Oh, excuse me. Have you
seen my granddaughter?

409
00:21:50,525 --> 00:21:51,817
Yes ma'am,

410
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:54,192
I saw her earlier as she was
heading out for the day.

411
00:21:54,275 --> 00:21:55,525
[DOJIMA]
Oh.

412
00:21:56,942 --> 00:21:58,442
[DOJIMA] What could
she possibly be doing

413
00:21:58,525 --> 00:22:00,358
so early in the morning?

414
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,775
I suppose then,

415
00:22:04,858 --> 00:22:08,817
I really must take action
before things go even further.

416
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:54,525
[CHIKA]
Next time, "Meaning and Role"
