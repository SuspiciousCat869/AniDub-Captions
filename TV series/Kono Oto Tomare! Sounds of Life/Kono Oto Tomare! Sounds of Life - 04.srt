00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:17,664
Right.

163
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:19,040
Once more, from the top.

164
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:21,167
[TAKEZO]
We can't, it's closing time.

165
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:22,669
We have to clean up.

166
00:08:22,711 --> 00:08:24,295
[CHIKA]
I just don't understand it.

167
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:27,007
Why is playing in sync so hard?

168
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:29,843
Here's a fun fact,
did you know that I'm the one

169
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:32,262
who started Tokise
High School's koto club?

170
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:34,514
Why would I care
about all that crap?

171
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:36,558
I'd rather play by myself.

172
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,601
As usual, you don't get it.

173
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:40,437
It's just different, y'know?

174
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:41,855
The sound you make when you play

175
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:44,524
with other people you've
spent a lot of time with.

176
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:48,153
Well, that's not something
you can produce by yourself.

177
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:49,738
It's nice.

178
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:57,162
[TAKEZO]
I feel bad for Hozuki.

179
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:59,247
She probably doesn't
know what to do.

180
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:03,334
[TAKEZO] What was it
like when I first started?

181
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:06,379
[MASHIRO] After this,
we should all hang out!

182
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:07,464
[TAKEZO]
Huh?

183
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:09,549
Uh. Hey, guys?

184
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:10,717
When we're done cleaning up,

185
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:12,927
do you wanna go
get something to eat?

186
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:15,680
Um. Together?

187
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:17,182
Yeah, that sounds fun.

188
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,100
I'm so there;
what should we eat?

189
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:22,395
[SATOWA]
Sorry, but I'll have to pass.

190
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:27,609
You should join us
every once in a while.

191
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:29,402
Come on, everybody.

192
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:30,528
Uh. Hey!

193
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,404
Let go of me!

194
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:34,866
[KOTA, SANE, MITTSU]
Aw yeah, time for food!

195
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:38,369
So, is this your
first time eating monja?

196
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:40,538
What do you mean?
Of course, it's not!

197
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,207
[TAKEZO]
Which is code for "it is."

198
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:43,124
[SERVER]
Here you go!

199
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:46,086
Cheesy mochi and
stamina monja for strength!

200
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:47,420
[KOTA, MITTSU, SANE]
All right!

201
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:50,423
Oh cool, are you gonna
cook it for us, Hozuki?

202
00:09:50,465 --> 00:09:51,091
Nice!

203
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:51,925
For real!

204
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:53,760
Thanks so much!

205
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:56,679
Uh, hey.

206
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:58,556
It's okay if you
don't feel like cooking.

207
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,642
Yeah, we don't mind doing it.

208
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:07,732
Look, if you can't do it,
then you should just say so.

209
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:12,028
And if you don't know something,
then you should tell us, okay?

210
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:14,030
No one's gonna get mad at you.

211
00:10:14,656 --> 00:10:17,283
[TAKEZO]
Right, and what's more.

212
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:19,702
That also applies to the club.

213
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:20,787
You've got talent.

214
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:22,956
That's great, and it helps.

215
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:25,416
But that doesn't mean
you have to be perfect.

216
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:28,253
And yeah, I don't always
know what to do either.

217
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,213
But if there's a
problem you can't solve,

218
00:10:30,255 --> 00:10:32,674
then we'll work it out together.

219
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,762
Hey, looks like the monja
is about ready to eat.

220
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:40,682
Oh, I thought it might
take longer to cook.

221
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:52,026
[KOTA]
You eat it like this.

222
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:00,660
It's delicious.

223
00:11:00,702 --> 00:11:02,120
Of course it is!

224
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:05,248
I'm the one who
cooked it, after all.

225
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:10,545
[SATOWA]
Look, the truth is...

226
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:14,591
I'm struggling because I don't
know how to teach you properly.

227
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:18,303
Learning how to play together
isn't something I can explain.

228
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:20,346
I've always been
naturally gifted.

229
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:22,432
Playing the koto
is just easy for me.

230
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:23,892
You know, you really
should have quit talking

231
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:25,518
while you were ahead!

232
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,144
Okay now.

233
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:27,812
Take a deep breath.

234
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:29,230
We can figure it out.

235
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:31,065
As a team.

236
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:34,861
Well, let's think about it.

237
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:37,780
So, I play the guitar in a band,
but we also have a drummer

238
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:39,657
so gauging the
tempo's pretty easy.

239
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,117
Maybe that's the answer.

240
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:44,329
Instead of matching everyone,
we match someone.

241
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:45,872
[KOTA]
Yeah, that makes sense.

242
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:48,041
Well, you guys should
try syncing to me!

243
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:49,167
[SANE]
Why you?

244
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:51,502
[MITTSU] If we're clapping,
I could probably do it.

245
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:52,545
[TAKEZO]
Oh, then to start,

246
00:11:52,587 --> 00:11:56,132
why don't we practice
clapping to the same rhythm?

247
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:57,800
[SERVER]
Sounds like you're having fun!

248
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:59,177
Here, this one's on the house.

249
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:00,595
[MITTSU]
Meal's not done yet!

250
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:02,222
[KOTA, SANE]
Yay, free food!

251
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:11,105
[SATOWA]
One, two, three, four.

252
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:13,399
Fourth and fifth koto rest.

253
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:14,567
All together now.

254
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:20,949
[SATOWA]
Okay.

255
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,367
Let's take a little break.

256
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:22,951
Aw, man!

257
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:25,328
It's so fast that
I can't keep up!

258
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:26,496
But you know what.

259
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:29,666
Hozuki clapping out the cues
is making a huge difference.

260
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:31,292
We're staying together!

261
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:32,502
[CHIKA]
True.

262
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:35,129
But we shouldn't get in
the habit of relying on it.

263
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:37,131
Let's try playing
without the clapping.

264
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:37,757
Wait.

265
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:39,926
So, have you already
memorized when to come in?

266
00:12:39,968 --> 00:12:41,469
Uh, yeah. Kind of.

267
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:43,763
[MITTSU] I actually think
I've figured it out, too.

268
00:12:43,805 --> 00:12:46,307
I'm probably ready
to give it a whirl.

269
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,226
Mizuhara.

270
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:50,353
You don't have
to rush yourself, okay?

271
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:51,271
I'll try to play,

272
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:53,982
so that it's easier for
the other parts to come in.

273
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:55,733
[KOTA]
Yeah. Okay.

274
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,110
Hey. You'll be fine.

275
00:12:57,151 --> 00:12:58,945
[KOTA]
Mm‐hmm.

276
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:00,280
[TAKEZO]
Everyone, ready?

277
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:01,739
Let's start.

278
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:02,949
Three and...

279
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:04,951
[ALL]
One, two, three, four.

280
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:09,622
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.

281
00:13:09,664 --> 00:13:11,874
One, two, three, four.

282
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:14,752
One, two, three!

283
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:16,754
[ALL]
Now!

284
00:13:23,386 --> 00:13:24,512
Whoa, we did it!

285
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:25,346
[SANE, MITTSU]
Yeah!

286
00:13:25,388 --> 00:13:26,264
[CHIKA]
What the hell?

287
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:29,350
We were finally together,
and you just stopped.

288
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:30,643
[CHIKA]
Still though.

289
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:33,730
I gotta admit it sounded good.

290
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:35,940
[KOTA]
Praise me, Chika!

291
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:38,151
[TAKEZO] Shouldn't
we get back to practicing?

292
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:39,777
[SANE]
I can't believe we did it!

293
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:42,238
[excited chatter]

294
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,282
Let's just try and do
the next part, already.

295
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:46,034
[ALL 3]
Okay.

296
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:49,620
[SHIZU] Your practice
group seems larger.

297
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:51,247
Oh, uh, you noticed?

298
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:52,790
[SHIZU]
My goodness.

299
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,334
Well, do as you please,

300
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:57,170
I guess I don't mind
a little more noise.

301
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:57,837
[TAKEZO]
I didn't know

302
00:13:57,879 --> 00:14:00,798
that they were putting in
extra practice hours here.

303
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:04,052
The club president should
know these kinds of things.

304
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,348
[SHIZU]
Hmm?

305
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:14,312
Granny.
He's trying to thank you.

306
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:16,314
He really is grateful.

307
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:20,818
[SATOWA]
Stop.

308
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,528
We're off again.

309
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:23,613
[SANE]
We've got the beginning down,

310
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:25,281
but we can't nail the rest.

311
00:14:25,323 --> 00:14:26,032
[CHIKA]
Crap.

312
00:14:26,074 --> 00:14:27,116
[TAKEZO]
This isn't good.

313
00:14:27,158 --> 00:14:29,160
The atmosphere is
becoming tense again.

314
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:30,161
Hey, Hozuki?

315
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:31,454
Why don't we take
a little break?

316
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:34,165
Sakai, you can rest your legs.

317
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:36,501
Thanks so much,
President Four‐Eyes!

318
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:38,252
[KOTA]
I'm so sorry!

319
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:40,046

[TAKEZO] I think the variation

[SATOWA] A motif is
a piece's image or theme.

You have to consider what
the piece is trying to convey,

I'm not sure yet.

361
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:13,848

the title replaces "ryuu"

Why are kotos
associated with dragons?

Well, it's a
little hard to explain,

So, kotos, which are created to
resemble those same dragons,

00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:22,615
[SATOWA]
This is unusual.

477
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:24,033
You're the first one here.

478
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:24,909
I know.

479
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,911
But I kinda feel like I'm
holding everyone back,

480
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:30,664
so I thought I'd get here
early and practice.

481
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:33,876
It seems like you're
trying really hard, but why?

482
00:21:33,918 --> 00:21:37,254
[KOTA]
Because Chika is trying so hard.

483
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:39,381
The three of us decided
to put in our best effort

484
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:40,966
for Chika's sake.

485
00:21:42,593 --> 00:21:43,636
[SATOWA]
It's odd.

486
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:44,720
I never gave much thought

487
00:21:44,762 --> 00:21:48,390
to why he's playing
the koto, but now...

488
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:52,228
Is he playing the koto because
of his grandfather's influence?

489
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:55,147
[KOTA] Oh wow, I didn't
realize you knew about all that.

490
00:21:55,189 --> 00:21:57,107
Oh, well, I don't.

491
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:58,192
I think we were all surprised

492
00:21:58,234 --> 00:22:00,611
when Chika began
playing the koto.

493
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:02,530
I thought the incident
with his grandfather

494
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:05,366
and the instruments would have
been too traumatic, y'know?

495
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:06,784
What do you mean by that?

496
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:08,661
[KOTA]
I mean...

497
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:16,460
[SATOWA]
Huh?

498
00:23:56,727 --> 00:23:57,686
[CHIKA]
Next time:

499
00:23:57,728 --> 00:24:00,230
"Let Our Sound Resound
and Reach Them."
