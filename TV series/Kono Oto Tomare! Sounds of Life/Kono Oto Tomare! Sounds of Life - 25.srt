by how long it took them

to clap for us?

173

[HIRO] Yeah, why wait
'til they cut the lights?

174
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:14,817
I wonder if our performance
was actually just that bad.

175
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,192
Stop it, it was fine!

176
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:18,192
Honestly, I think
our performance

177
00:16:18,275 --> 00:16:19,692
up there was our best one ever.

178
00:16:19,775 --> 00:16:22,192
Do you really mean that, Takezo?

179
00:16:22,275 --> 00:16:24,858
There you are. Good thing
we came straight here.

180

I'm so glad to see you!
I'm freakin' out over here!

Miss Aki! You have to
tell us how we sounded!

00:16:31,317 --> 00:16:33,067
Were we terrible?

What's with those faces?

You guys don't have
to look so worried.

00:16:43,067 --> 00:16:44,817
[chuckles]
Just relax.

188
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:47,233
That was a wonderful

[ALL sigh]

You think so, don't you,
Mr. Takinami?

191
00:16:52,067 --> 00:16:54,900
Kinda. They did
so-so, I guess.

192
00:16:54,983 --> 00:16:56,817
C'mon. Let's get going.

193
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:59,942
Well that settles it! We didn't
do that good after all!

194
00:17:00,025 --> 00:17:02,025
Why are you such a jerk?

195
00:17:02,108 --> 00:17:04,275
Hey. Wait Mr. Takinami.

196
00:17:04,358 --> 00:17:06,108
You really shouldn't
be so stubborn.

197
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:07,650
Be honest and say what you feel.

198
00:17:07,733 --> 00:17:10,942
See, the thing about me
is that I'm always honest.

199
00:17:11,025 --> 00:17:13,733
Having watched them
grow all this time.

200
00:17:13,817 --> 00:17:15,817
That was nothing
special for them.

201
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,483
[gasps]

202
00:17:23,942 --> 00:17:27,108
Uh. Hey, Hozuki.
Is something wrong?

203
00:17:27,192 --> 00:17:30,733
[SATOWA] Oh. no. I just feel
tired now that it's over.

204
00:17:30,817 --> 00:17:33,900
Oh yeah. I understand.
I feel the same.

205
00:17:33,983 --> 00:17:38,233
But now, all that's left is to
wait for the results, and hope.

206
00:17:38,317 --> 00:17:41,608
[gasps]
Uh-huh.

207
00:17:44,608 --> 00:17:48,150
Ugh. Damn it! Tokise High
School was so damn good!

208
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:51,692
[KOMAKI] It made me cry too,
I don't get it! I'm scared.

209
00:17:51,775 --> 00:17:54,400
What's going on? Why?

210
00:17:56,983 --> 00:18:00,358
[YAMAMOTO] Wow. It was
a very good performance.

211
00:18:00,442 --> 00:18:03,900
Not only that, but the
piece was incredible.

212
00:18:03,983 --> 00:18:06,650
I composed mine to allow
Kanzaki to stand out

213
00:18:06,733 --> 00:18:09,692
and balanced his role
with the others.

214
00:18:09,775 --> 00:18:12,442
In contrast, Tokise's piece
was made to bring

215
00:18:12,525 --> 00:18:15,025
out the characteristics
of each part.

216
00:18:16,108 --> 00:18:18,108
[YAMAMOTO]
Ah, dammit.

Today's my last day doing this,

to write the next piece.

are all gone, too.

all right over there?

[MASHIRO] Uh! I'm sorry.
I'm just so deeply moved.

some tissues!

All right you kids,
I've gotta get going.

You performed well,
you should be proud.

Hey, thanks again, Granny!

Yeah, thank you very much!

Okay, then.

All the performances are
finished now, and there's still

233
00:18:59,608 --> 00:19:02,525
some time before the results
are set to be announced.

think it would it be a problem

came today, and um,

home already, but maybe not.

this before, you dummy!

please still be around!
