1
00:00:18,067 --> 00:00:22,525
[MIO] When I open sheet music,
sounds glow, and rise up,

2
00:00:22,608 --> 00:00:25,275
creating a path in the darkness.

3
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:29,192
All I do is move forward,
following that light.

4
00:00:29,275 --> 00:00:32,775
So I don't go off course and
get swallowed by the darkness.

5
00:00:32,858 --> 00:00:35,692
I follow the path faithfully.

6
00:00:35,775 --> 00:00:39,733
That's the only way I know
to play the koto right now.

7
00:02:11,525 --> 00:02:15,567
What? The Advisor? Me?
For the school's koto club?

8
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:18,400
Ten years ago.
One year out of college.

9
00:02:18,483 --> 00:02:21,150
After landing my dream
job of math teacher.

10
00:02:21,233 --> 00:02:24,192
I was made the advisor of
a club I'd never heard of.

11
00:02:24,275 --> 00:02:26,858
The world of music was
completely unknown to me,

12
00:02:26,942 --> 00:02:29,317
not to mention the koto.

13
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,192
Oh wow, interesting!

14
00:02:31,275 --> 00:02:33,400
I think I'm starting to come
around on the koto.

15
00:02:33,483 --> 00:02:34,858
[FEMALE MEMBER A]
What? You haven't even heard

16
00:02:34,942 --> 00:02:36,317
a performance yet.

17
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,150
I know. But look at this!
It's so familiar!

18
00:02:39,233 --> 00:02:41,025
It's a combination
of 13 numbers,

19
00:02:41,108 --> 00:02:42,608
one through <i>kin</i> , right?

20
00:02:42,692 --> 00:02:45,150
It looks like a math problem,
so I'm drawn to it!

21
00:02:45,233 --> 00:02:46,442
[KOTO CLUB MEMBERS]
Huh?

22
00:02:46,525 --> 00:02:48,025
[YAMAMOTO] I casually
started learning about

23
00:02:48,108 --> 00:02:49,692
the world of the koto.

24
00:02:49,775 --> 00:02:52,650
[YAMAMOTO] All right! First I'll
listen to the "classics".

25
00:02:52,733 --> 00:02:54,983
There's a lot to learn!

26
00:02:55,067 --> 00:02:56,692
[gasps]

27
00:02:56,775 --> 00:02:59,442
[YAMAMOTO] What I found
there... was a delicate,

28
00:02:59,525 --> 00:03:02,775
meticulous world that seemed
to be perfectly calculated.

29
00:03:02,858 --> 00:03:05,733
It was indeed a world
of math, which I loved.

30
00:03:05,817 --> 00:03:07,233
With infinite potential,

31
00:03:07,317 --> 00:03:11,108
contained within
only 13 strings.

32
00:03:11,192 --> 00:03:15,400
Unbelievable. I'm listening
to math right now!

33
00:03:15,483 --> 00:03:16,692
[YAMAMOTO]
After that,

34
00:03:16,775 --> 00:03:19,025
I was rapidly sucked into
the world of music,

35
00:03:19,108 --> 00:03:22,192
and eventually started
creating pieces.

36
00:03:22,275 --> 00:03:24,733
Though they weren't popular
among the students,

37
00:03:24,817 --> 00:03:26,775
so no one played them.

38
00:03:26,858 --> 00:03:30,608
[YAMAMOTO] I guess teenagers
prefer modern music after all.

39
00:03:30,692 --> 00:03:33,483
But, I like the
classics the most.

40
00:03:33,567 --> 00:03:35,983
The number of sounds,
how they're assembled,

41
00:03:36,067 --> 00:03:39,775
and their timing.
They're beautiful and efficient.

42
00:03:39,858 --> 00:03:42,233
Even after I was transferred
to a different school,

43
00:03:42,317 --> 00:03:44,025
I kept creating pieces.

44
00:03:44,108 --> 00:03:48,192
And then... I ended up
in Hakuto's koto club.

45
00:03:48,275 --> 00:03:51,525
[YAMAMOTO] We got so many new
first-year members this year!

46
00:03:51,608 --> 00:03:55,275
Maybe if I'm lucky, one of them
will play a song or two of mine!

47
00:03:55,358 --> 00:03:57,192
Eh, but probably not.

48
00:03:59,692 --> 00:04:03,733
[YAMAMOTO]
Wait. This is my piece!

49
00:04:09,025 --> 00:04:13,067
[YAMAMOTO] My song.
My world, is coming to life?

50
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:16,025
Yes! This is just how
I wanted it played!

51
00:04:16,108 --> 00:04:19,942
This is the perfected
version of my piece!

52
00:04:20,025 --> 00:04:21,233
You are?

53
00:04:21,317 --> 00:04:24,525
Oh! Um, hi, I'm Yamamoto,
the koto club advisor!

54
00:04:24,608 --> 00:04:27,817
[YAMAMOTO] I think this is that
new member named Kanzaki.

55
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,442
I don't know if you
knew this or not,

56
00:04:29,525 --> 00:04:31,317
but I'm actually the one
who wrote the piece

57
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,942
you were just playing.

58
00:04:33,025 --> 00:04:34,733
Oh. I didn't.

59
00:04:34,817 --> 00:04:37,150
I just found it on
the shelf there.

60
00:04:37,233 --> 00:04:38,817
Should I have not played it?

61
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,275
No! That's not what I meant!

62
00:04:40,358 --> 00:04:42,650
Truth be told, I'm really
happy you performed it!

63
00:04:42,733 --> 00:04:45,025
Thank you for that.
It was great.

64
00:04:45,108 --> 00:04:46,442
[gasps]

65
00:04:46,525 --> 00:04:48,317
I've composed lots of other
songs if you'd like to--

66
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:48,983
[MIO]
No thanks.

67
00:04:49,067 --> 00:04:52,317
[gasps]
What? Why?

68
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,192
My sound it's...
it's boring. So...

69
00:04:56,275 --> 00:04:57,900
[gasps]

70
00:05:01,525 --> 00:05:02,775
[YAMAMOTO]
Suzumori!

71
00:05:02,858 --> 00:05:05,775
Am I right in remembering
Kanzaki is your cousin?

72
00:05:05,858 --> 00:05:08,817
I wanted to ask you something.

73
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,817
[UTA] Both of Mio's
parents work a lot,

74
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:13,192
so he often spent
time at my place.

75
00:05:13,275 --> 00:05:15,650
My mom was starting to learn
the koto at the time,

76
00:05:15,733 --> 00:05:18,275
so we both picked it up
and learned along with her.

77
00:05:18,358 --> 00:05:20,233
I think we were around
six back then.

78
00:05:20,317 --> 00:05:22,442
Wow. So you two have
been playing the koto

79
00:05:22,525 --> 00:05:25,233
for a long time.
No wonder you're so good.

80
00:05:25,317 --> 00:05:28,858
Well I'm okay. But Mio's
really something special.

81
00:05:28,942 --> 00:05:31,275
Apparently, he can "see" sounds.

82
00:05:31,358 --> 00:05:32,608
[YAMAMOTO]
What?

83
00:05:32,692 --> 00:05:34,275
[UTA] It's like he somehow
knows the "right answer"

84
00:05:34,358 --> 00:05:38,275
for how he should play
or express any given piece.

85
00:05:38,358 --> 00:05:40,275
Well that's an
incredible talent!

86
00:05:40,358 --> 00:05:43,858
Uh-huh. I think so to,
but Mio seems to hate it.

87
00:05:43,942 --> 00:05:46,108
He says that the "right"
sounds are boring.

88
00:05:46,192 --> 00:05:48,567
That set-in-stone
music is no fun,

89
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:51,983
so he hates his own sound.

90
00:05:52,067 --> 00:05:55,525
He's been searching for the
"sound beyond the right answer."

91
00:05:57,608 --> 00:06:03,108
Kanzaki! I heard that you can
see sounds. Is that true?

92
00:06:03,192 --> 00:06:04,608
It is. So what?

93
00:06:04,692 --> 00:06:07,317
I want you to play
the pieces I compose!

94
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,150
When I found you playing
one the other day,

95
00:06:09,233 --> 00:06:14,067
I was really impressed,
and I was very very moved.

96
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:15,983
It was like the world
I pictured started moving

97
00:06:16,067 --> 00:06:20,775
exactly the way I wanted.
It was an amazing feeling!

98
00:06:20,858 --> 00:06:23,108
I don't want to play exactly
the way you meant it.

99
00:06:23,192 --> 00:06:26,775
That's not enough.
I want to go "beyond" that.

100
00:06:26,858 --> 00:06:31,025
Or else I'll never be able...
to be moved by my own sound.

101
00:06:31,108 --> 00:06:33,567
[gasps]
Okay.

102
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:37,567
Then I'll make a piece that'll
allow you to go "beyond that."

103
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:38,775
Because I want to hear your

104
00:06:38,858 --> 00:06:41,942
"sound beyond the
right answer," too!

105
00:06:42,025 --> 00:06:44,650
Will you trust me,
with your talent?

106
00:06:44,733 --> 00:06:46,692
I can help you!

107
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:49,150
[MIO]
No.

108
00:06:49,233 --> 00:06:50,358
Why?

109
00:06:50,442 --> 00:06:50,900
[MIO]
You're scary.

110
00:06:50,983 --> 00:06:53,358
Kanzaki!

111
00:06:53,442 --> 00:06:55,483
[YAMAMOTO]
And so, here we are.

112
00:06:55,567 --> 00:06:58,108
Oh, no. I'm all tingly
and nervous.

113
00:06:58,192 --> 00:07:01,317
You're our advisor, why don't
you try acting like it?

114
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,900
By the way, I meant to ask.

115
00:07:02,983 --> 00:07:05,900
You're quitting teaching
after the qualifier, right?

116
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:08,108
H-Hold on a second,
how'd you know that?

117
00:07:08,192 --> 00:07:09,650
I mean, everyone knows it.

118
00:07:09,733 --> 00:07:12,192
You're the only one who thinks
that it's some big secret.

119
00:07:12,275 --> 00:07:13,400
Huh?

120
00:07:13,483 --> 00:07:15,775
You're taking over your
family's inn right?

121
00:07:15,858 --> 00:07:17,275
And we know you weren't sick.

122
00:07:17,358 --> 00:07:19,483
You made that up when you
couldn't come to the traditional

123
00:07:19,567 --> 00:07:22,067
music festival because
your dad collapsed.

124
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:25,567
Are you really going
to quit after this?

125
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:28,275
[sighs]

126
00:07:28,358 --> 00:07:30,733
I thought it over for a while.

127
00:07:32,233 --> 00:07:33,650
Right.

128
00:07:37,858 --> 00:07:40,442
Grand Master.
Let's go back home.

129
00:07:40,525 --> 00:07:43,358
No performance so far
has been that good.

130
00:07:43,442 --> 00:07:45,483
If the competition's
anything to go by,

131
00:07:45,567 --> 00:07:48,775
we can't expect much from
Satowa's school, either.

132
00:07:53,108 --> 00:07:56,192
I think I'll step outside
to get some fresh air.

133
00:07:58,108 --> 00:08:01,400
[DOJIMA grunts] I don't want to
even be here a minute longer.

134
00:08:01,483 --> 00:08:04,108
I'm leaving too.

135
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:06,858
[AKIRA] You heard me, come on.
You need to hear them play!

136
00:08:06,942 --> 00:08:08,400
Grandmother!

137
00:08:08,483 --> 00:08:11,442
You've always been the one who
can't face the koto head-on.

138
00:08:11,525 --> 00:08:14,567
[DOJIMA] I know what she said,
but I can no longer do that.

139
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:16,567
It's too late for me.

140
00:08:19,608 --> 00:08:22,483
[KEISHI]
Oh. Grandma, you came too?

141
00:08:22,567 --> 00:08:24,233
[DOJIMA]
Keishi!

142
00:08:26,525 --> 00:08:29,942
Hey. We need to leave
in five. Get ready.

143
00:08:30,025 --> 00:08:31,775
Guess it's time to go!
Gotta pull it together!

144
00:08:31,858 --> 00:08:32,650
I'm calm, are you?

145
00:08:32,733 --> 00:08:34,317
What do I do? I can't breathe.

146
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,942
You're gonna be fine, Kota.
Deep breaths! Calm down.

147
00:08:37,025 --> 00:08:37,942
I'm not Kota.

148
00:08:38,025 --> 00:08:39,942
Hozuki save me!

149
00:08:40,025 --> 00:08:41,817
Uh. Hey, you guys?

150
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:44,108
After leaving this room,
we gotta be quiet.

151
00:08:44,192 --> 00:08:45,442
Wanna form a circle?

152
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,317
One good cuddle-puddle
for the road!

153
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,150
I'm in!

154
00:08:48,233 --> 00:08:49,775
That'll totally pump me up!

155
00:08:49,858 --> 00:08:51,358
[TAKEZO] You two could
join if you'd like.

156
00:08:51,442 --> 00:08:52,817
