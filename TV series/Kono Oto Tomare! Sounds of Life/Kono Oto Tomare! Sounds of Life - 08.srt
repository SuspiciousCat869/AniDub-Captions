00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:20,917
Isaki, you little‐‐!

164
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:26,172
I'm Chika's aunt, Isaki Kudo.

165
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:27,674
His father's little sister.

166
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:30,135
It's nice to meet you;
make yourselves at home.

167
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,344
I've asked you a thousand times:

168
00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:33,555
can you not leave
your clothes everywhere?

169
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:35,598
Just gonna ignore that.

170
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,599
Where's your room, Chika?

171
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:37,308
Yeah, man!

172
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,394
You gotta show us!

173
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:41,479
My room's over there.

174
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:42,981
Huh?

175
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:47,068
What a nice room.

176
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:47,777
[KOTA]
Mm‐hmm.

177
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:50,030
Looks like fun!

178
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:50,655
Hey!

179
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:52,741
It's your grandfather's koto!

180
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:54,492
Wait. But there's two of them.

181
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:55,452
[CHIKA]
Yeah.

182
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:57,370
I borrowed the
other one from Granny.

183
00:08:57,412 --> 00:08:58,496
[MITTSU]
Huh? Why?

184
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,540
Gotta practice with something.

185
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:01,833
And I don't know if it's okay

186
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:04,544
for me to play
my grandpa's koto yet.

187
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:06,755
What would you do if
someone were to steal it,

188
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:08,465
or if it got damaged?

189
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:11,092
[CHIKA] A bunch of kotos
got destroyed 'cause of me,

190
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:12,761
but I didn't learn my lesson.

191
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:16,556
I shoulda shown more respect
for this one from the start.

192
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:19,684
Granny, could you hold
on to this for a bit for me?

193
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:22,520
I really don't think I have
the right to play it yet.

194
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,105
What are you on about?

195
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:27,901
Gen made this koto for you,
and I saw your potential.

196
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:31,529
That's why I gave it
to you in the first place.

197
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,448
Though you seem sure.

198
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:35,992
In the meantime,
I'll lend you a different one.

199
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:36,951
When the day comes,

200
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:39,329
and you feel like you can
allow yourself to play it,

201
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:40,997
please don't hesitate.

202
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:44,000
But don't make
Gen's koto wait too long.

203
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:45,460
Understand?

204
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:46,419
[CHIKA]
And I still don't know

205
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:49,255
whether it's okay for
me to play it or not, so...

206
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:51,508
What do you mean
"you still don't know"?

207
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:53,802
Of course it's
okay for you to play it!

208
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:54,677
Huh?

209
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:56,846
There's no reason
for it not to be!

210
00:09:56,888 --> 00:09:59,265
I know just how much
you care about the koto.

211
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:02,060
And how much you
care about your grandpa!

212
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:05,063
I've watched you face the koto
over and over so head‐on

213
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:08,066
that you're
practically too head‐on!

214
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:09,025
All of us.

215
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:10,985
We've all watched you!

00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:12,654
[CHIKA gasps]

217
00:10:14,823 --> 00:10:16,199
[CHIKA]
The hell.

218
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:20,078
Why do you guys look like you're
the ones who're about to cry?

219
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:23,665
[ISAKI] "Stop yappin'
and just play it already!"

220
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:25,250
You know your grandad.

221
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,752
That's what he would have said.

222
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:34,342
[SANE]
What are you gonna play first?

223
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:35,552
"Rokudan"?

224
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:36,886
No, if I'm gonna play it,

225
00:10:36,928 --> 00:10:39,347
then I wanna play the piece
my grandpa taught me.

226
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:41,474
But I have no idea what the
right tuning for it is‐‐

227
00:10:41,516 --> 00:10:42,642
[ISAKI]
Step aside.

228
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:43,726
[CHIKA]
What are you doing?

229
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:44,769
[ISAKI]
Be quiet.

230
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:47,772
The great Isaki
will do the tuning for you.

231
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:51,359
You probably didn't know it,
but my father wrote that piece.

232
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:51,985
What?

233
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:53,027
Grandpa did?

234
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:54,612
[ISAKI]
There. All done.

00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:56,781
[GEN]
Okay, then.

236
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:58,867
Put this on your finger.

237
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:12,172
[GEN]
Listen up, Chika.

238
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:13,965
Sound is special.

239
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:16,968
It touches people's souls.

240
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,178
And pieces of music

241
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:22,432
are basically the souls of their
composers in physical form.

242
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:25,602
The song is their soul.

243
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:28,396
[CHIKA] I wonder why
grandpa wrote this piece.

244
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:29,480
When?

245
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,274
What was he thinking about?

246
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:34,319
And what was he feeling
when he taught it to me?

247
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,489
[CHIKA]
I get it now.

248
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:42,327
So this is what it
means to "face" a piece.

249
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:43,745
Aw, man.

250
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:45,371
I can't help but cry a little.

Warm and heartbreaking
at the same time!

Hey, Isaki.

If something ever were
to happen to me,

259
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:09,979
do you think you could
you look after Chika for me?

00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:12,690
Don't say that kinda stuff.

262
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,776
[GEN] Can't you think
about it for your dad?

263
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:17,528
That boy's eyes have
become gentler recently.

264
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:21,282
He showed me his smile for the
first time, just the other day.

265
00:12:21,324 --> 00:12:24,827
I feel like he's this close
to living a more positive life.

266
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:26,871
But if I were to suddenly
be out of the picture,

267
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:30,375
he'd lose the one
place he has to return to.

268
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:34,254
Not to mention, he'd have no
adult to tell him off anymore.

269
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:37,799
Honestly, I just want him
to always be smiling.

Even after I'm gone.

Don't worry.

lively today, don't they?

stop getting your nails done?

283
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:11,749
Well, you can't play the
koto with fake nails anyway.

Nothing.

And now they're facing
the koto, head‐on.

I think I get it now.

00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:51,391
[KAZUSA FUMI]
Another boy?

322
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:52,975
What's the deal
with all the shouting?

323
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:54,435
[KAZUSA, FUMI]
More boys!

324
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:56,187
There's nothing but boys here.

325
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:57,855
Is this hell?

326
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,607
[SATOWA]
What are you guys up to?

327
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:10,201
[KAZUSA]
It's... Satowa!

328
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:11,828
[SATOWA]
Huh?

329
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:13,704
Successor of the Kao school.

330
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,081
Kazusa Otori.

331
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:16,290
That right?

332
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:17,625
Yes, ma'am!

333
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:18,793
The "Kao school"?

334
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:20,002
Never heard of it.

335
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:21,754
[TAKEZO]
It rivals the Hozuki school.

336
00:15:21,796 --> 00:15:22,839
It's pretty big.

337
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,174
Okay, so then Hozuki knows her?

338
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:27,051
Well, I know her name, but...

339
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:28,177
[FUMI]
What did you just say?

340
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:29,887
Do you know how much
Kazusa thinks about you‐‐?

341
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,681
Thank you, Fumi, but it's okay.

342
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:34,934
I remember the first time I saw
Satowa like it was yesterday!

343
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:35,768
It was at the recital

344
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:39,522
for the Kao and Hozuki schools
held once every two years.

345
00:15:39,564 --> 00:15:42,525
Every performer played
amazing pieces for their ages,

346
00:15:42,567 --> 00:15:45,069
but Satowa's performance
was so fantastic,

347
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:47,447
I couldn't stop my
tears from flowing!

348
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:49,115
At at the time
I was so embarrassed,

349
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:50,324
I couldn't even say hello!

350
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:52,160
Are you saying you
don't actually know her?

351
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:54,328
All I said was it was my dream
to be able to play the koto

352
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:56,456
with her one day!

353
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:59,125
However, after her
legendary performance

354
00:15:59,167 --> 00:16:00,960
on the grand stage at nationals,

355
00:16:01,002 --> 00:16:03,588
Satowa suddenly disappeared
from the koto scene.

356
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:04,714
But then the other day.

357
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:07,884
I heard a rumor that Satowa was
here, so I came to check it out!

358
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:11,095
I had never heard of Tokise High
School's koto club before.

359
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:11,888
Now that I've come,

360
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:13,806
I see that it's just a hangout
for these barbaric boys,

361
00:16:13,848 --> 00:16:15,933
with a dirty club room.

362
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,768
I know what happened
to you after the competition,

363
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,270
but this is excessive!

364
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:22,190
To think you've ended up in
a rickety old place like this!

365
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:25,276
I'm begging you, come to
the Himesaka girls' academy!

366
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:28,529
Let's play the koto together,
at a better school!

367
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:31,657
Um. No, thank you.

368
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:32,742
[gasps]

369
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:34,035
What? But why?

370
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:35,745
Could it be that these
unruly delinquents

371
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:38,164
have threatened
you to stay here?

372
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:39,123
That must be it!

373
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:39,790
Right?

374
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:40,708
How cruel!

375
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:41,751
What terrible boys!

376
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:43,461
No, that's not the reason!

377
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:46,130
I just happen
to like it here, okay?]

378
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:52,845
Kazusa!

379
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:54,347
No way, no way!

380
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:56,265
I won't accept this!

381
00:16:56,307 --> 00:16:57,475
If you hear our club perform,

382
00:16:57,517 --> 00:16:59,894
I guarantee you'll want
to come play with us!

383
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:00,978
Club President.

384
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,897
Are you and the
club free next Saturday?

385
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:04,357
[TAKEZO]
Uh, yeah.

386
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:06,567
We're having a joint
practice session that day.

387
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:08,110
It's with the club from Meiryo,

388
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:11,906
the elite Tokyo school, and
our own Himesaka koto club.

389
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:14,992
Bring Satowa and
come watch all of us perform!

390
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,244
Wait, Meiryo?

391
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:16,911
[KAZUSA]
Yes!

392
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:18,746
Meiryo is hosting the practice.

393
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:21,624
It's kind of late notice,
don't you think?

394
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:22,959
Whatever, bring it on!

395
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,585
I wanna hear if you
two can actually play

396
00:17:24,627 --> 00:17:25,962
or if you're all talk!

397
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:28,089
Are you part of this club, too?

398
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:30,800
I thought you were some felon
who forced his way in here.

399
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:31,717
Well, that's okay.

400
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:34,262
If you want to come too,
I won't stop you.

401
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:37,640
Because you'll realize just how
much better we are than you.

402
00:17:37,682 --> 00:17:40,184
And then you'll understand.

403
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:44,021
You aren't a
good match for Satowa!

404
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:44,814
Bye!

405
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:47,608
See you next Saturday, Satowa!

406
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:49,277
What the hell's
the matter with those girls?

407
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:51,571
Is Himesaka really that good?

408
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:53,281
I mean,
at this year's nationals,

409
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:55,616
they did represent Kanagawa.

410
00:17:55,658 --> 00:17:58,703
I've only ever heard them once,
but they were really good.

411
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:00,454
So what you're sayin' is,
if we crush 'em,

412
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:02,498
we'll be number one in Kanagawa!

413
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,000
We must study our enemy!

414
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:04,959
[TAKEZO]
Wait!

415
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:06,669
You actually want to go?

416
00:18:06,711 --> 00:18:08,838
We don't have to
if you're not interested.

417
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:10,089
[HIRO]
Why? Don't you want to?

418
00:18:10,131 --> 00:18:12,508
Uh, well, I...

419
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:17,471
[NAKAYAMA] You're first
place again, Kurata?

420
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:19,974
[TSUDA] If you keep this up,
you're bound to get into Meiryo!

421
00:18:20,016 --> 00:18:21,726
[NAKAYAMA]
We'll try our best to match you.

422
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,436
[TSUDA] Then we can hang
in high school, too!

423
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:24,937
[NAKAYAMA]
Yes! I got in!

424
00:18:24,979 --> 00:18:26,522
[TSUDA]
Whoa, me, too!

425
00:18:26,564 --> 00:18:28,774
[TSUDA, NAKAYAMA]
Now we can all go together!

426
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:34,822
[CHIKA]
You decide.

427
00:18:34,864 --> 00:18:35,448
Huh?

428
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:36,741
You're the club president, man.

429
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,242
If you say you don't
want to waste our time

430
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:40,369
going to see them play,
then we won't go.

431
00:18:40,411 --> 00:18:42,872
It's not a big deal.

432
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:43,873
Thanks, but...

433
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:47,209
It's a good
opportunity, so let's.

434
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:48,336
Oh, I forgot!

435
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:51,964
I brought in some song
options for the festival.

436
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:53,299
Oh, sweet!

437
00:18:53,341 --> 00:18:55,301
[SATOWA] I'm not familiar
with this one on the left.

438
00:18:55,343 --> 00:18:56,302
It's called "Kuon"?

439
00:18:56,344 --> 00:18:58,596
[CHIKA] It has the same
kanji as my name does!

440
00:18:58,638 --> 00:19:00,723
Was this piece made
for me or something?

441
00:19:00,765 --> 00:19:02,683
Yeah, I noticed that
when I was picking it out.

442
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:04,143
Kinda feels like fate, huh?

443
00:19:04,185 --> 00:19:05,436
You bet it does!

444
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:07,271
Let's do this piece
for the festival!

445
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:07,980
[SATOWA]
Hold on!

446
00:19:08,022 --> 00:19:11,025
We haven't taken one look at the
actual music yet; give it here.

447
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:14,362
We don't need to look at it when
it was clearly destined to be!

448
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:15,780
[SATOWA]
The parts for first koto

449
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,948
and the 17‐string
look difficult.

450
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,784
And the part where the
first koto splits into two

451
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:22,119
and becomes a duet
will be especially hard.

452
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,496
[CHIKA]
We can handle a challenge!

453
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:25,456
You play first koto
if you're so sure!

454
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:28,668
But... if we refine
the theme enough.

455
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:30,920
I think we could make
it sound beautiful.

456
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:31,879
Then it's settled.

457
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:33,631
We'll go with
"Kuon" for the festival!

458
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:35,132
[SANE]
Nice, that was easy!

459
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,218
[HIRO] Kurata should play
the other first koto part,

460
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:38,094
since it seems hard.

461
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:38,678
[TAKEZO]
Huh?

462
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:40,805
[CHIKA] Let's just
hurry up and practice!

463
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:42,348
[TAKINAMI]
A joint practice?

464
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:43,349
If other schools are going,

465
00:19:43,391 --> 00:19:45,601
that means I have to go,
too, doesn't it?

466
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:46,769
[TAKEZO]
Yeah, sorry.

467
00:19:46,811 --> 00:19:47,978
Well, it's fine.

468
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,523
Himesaka and Meiryo
are elite schools.

469
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:53,984
It might be a good opportunity
for your club to face reality.

470
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:54,902
[TAKEZO]
Reality?

471
00:19:54,944 --> 00:19:58,531
That very same reality you
witnessed yourself, last year.

472
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,205
You don't have to
make such a scary face.

473
00:20:06,247 --> 00:20:09,792
Surely you agree it's important
to see your superiors play.

474
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:12,420
Especially if you
wish to aim higher.

475
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:14,088
[gasps]

476
00:20:15,506 --> 00:20:17,591
[CHIKA]
Ugh, once more from the top.

477
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:20,094
Tak‐tak‐tak‐tak‐tak.

478
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:21,470
I messed up again!

479
00:20:21,512 --> 00:20:23,097
Can we stop this already?

480
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:24,765
It's honestly kind
of embarrassing.

481
00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:25,474
Shuddup!

482
00:20:25,516 --> 00:20:26,267
I can't stay together

483
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:28,894
with Four‐Eyes in this
part of the duet at all!

484
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:29,729
By the way,

485
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:32,356
you told those Himesaka girls
you liked it here, yeah?

486
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:33,566
Uh! Yes?

487
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:35,234
Why do you bring that up?

488
00:20:35,276 --> 00:20:36,527
I dunno, it just made me think,

489
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:39,196
"Man, this girl's really
aiming to be pro, isn't she"?

490
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,239
[SATOWA]
Huh?

491
00:20:40,281 --> 00:20:41,574
Well, didn't you
decide to join our club

492
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:44,368
so that you'd have a compelling
story to tell when you go pro?

493
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:46,078
Uh. I was.

494
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,288
What's the problem?

495
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:49,874
Am I wrong?

496
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,792
No, in fact,
you're exactly right!

497
00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:54,420
I'm using you guys
for a good pro backstory!

498
00:20:54,462 --> 00:20:55,963
Is that a problem?

499
00:20:56,005 --> 00:20:57,006
[CHIKA]
Not really.

500
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:57,590
[SATOWA]
What?

501
00:20:57,631 --> 00:20:58,632
You're telling me
that you're fine

502
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:00,968
with me being in the club
for a reason like that?

503
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:02,470
[CHIKA]
"A reason like that"?

504
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:04,930
It just means that your future
is riding on our performances,

505
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:05,931
doesn't it?

506
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:08,684
It's actually a pretty
big responsibility.

507
00:21:11,896 --> 00:21:16,442
[SATOWA] Look, the reason
I said I liked the club

508
00:21:16,484 --> 00:21:21,906
was because I like playing
with all of you guys, okay?

509
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:26,827
Huuuuh?

510
00:21:26,869 --> 00:21:28,496
There something wrong with that?

511
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:30,206
[CHIKA laughs] What,
are you getting embarrassed

512
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:31,457
by your own words?

513
00:21:31,499 --> 00:21:33,042
Talk about the
definition of lame!

514
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:34,043
[SATOWA]
What?! I can't believe you!

515
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:35,961
You are the worst!

516
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:36,796
Idiot!

517
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:37,630
Brat!

518
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:44,011
[laughs]

519
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:49,350
[CHIKA]
Who do you think you are, huh?

520
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:50,976
You've got some nerve!

521
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:52,645
You wanna go?!

522
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,275
[TAKINAMI]
You guys are late!

523
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,652
Twenty minutes to be exact.

524
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:00,945
[TAKEZO]
I'm so sorry!

525
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:03,155
Our train was running behind.

526
00:22:03,197 --> 00:22:03,781
[TAKINAMI]
Come on.

527
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:05,866
Let's hurry up and get in there.

528
00:23:57,394 --> 00:23:58,604
[TAKEZO]
Next time,

529
00:23:58,646 --> 00:24:00,356
"A Piercing Sound."
