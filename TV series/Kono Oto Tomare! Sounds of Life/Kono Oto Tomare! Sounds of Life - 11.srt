our training camp.

161
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:55,201
[GEN] The sound you make when
you play with your friends,

162
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:59,039
it's not something you can
produce by yourself.

163
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,708
[CHIKA] I think I understand
what you meant now.

164
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:06,546
[CHIKA]
At least a little.

165
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:12,677
[SHIZU] The festival's just
around the corner, huh?

166
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:14,804
Oh, and some of the
other high schools

167
00:09:14,846 --> 00:09:16,848
have nationals right before it.

168
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,349
Weird, but weren't
the preliminaries

169
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:19,684
all the way back in December?

170
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:21,561
It seems like a really huge gap.

171
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:23,354
Yes, it certainly is.

172
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:27,150
I do wish they'd consider the
timing of it all a little more.

173
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:28,193
[CHIKA]
Hm?

174
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,073
[CHIKA] Hey, do you remember
at training camp,

175
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:36,076
when you asked us what kind of
piece we thought "Kuon" was?

176
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:37,994
Did you ever figure it out?

177
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:40,246
I'm pretty sure Mizuhara did.

178
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:42,624
He really hit the mark
with what he said.

179
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:44,084
Kota did?

180
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,044
Yeah, he talked about
how amazing moments

181
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:49,130
like these are quick to
sometimes fly away from us.

182
00:09:49,172 --> 00:09:51,925
And that makes us wish
that it would never end.

183
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:55,970
[SATOWA] It was the same
with "Ryuuseigun."

184
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:58,181
If we can just identify
with the song somehow,

185
00:09:58,223 --> 00:10:01,392
then we can put emotion
into it that way.

186
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:04,479
[SATOWA]
What is it?

187
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:06,523
[CHIKA] Nothin'. I was
thinking it looks like you're

188
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:08,399
havin' a lot of fun, is all.

189
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:09,526
[gasps]

190
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:12,612
Do you like playing the
koto with us that much?

191
00:10:12,654 --> 00:10:15,323
[SATOWA] I just happen
to like it here, okay?

192
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:18,284
[gasps] Hey!

193
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:19,410
[SATOWA gasps]

194
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:20,703
[gasps]

195
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:24,958
Man, that was close.

196
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:26,501
You really need to
be more careful.

197
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:29,587
I don't know what we'd do if
you'd gotten hurt or somethin'.

198
00:10:41,516 --> 00:10:43,810
[SANE]
Chika.

199
00:10:43,852 --> 00:10:46,187
I can't trust you alone with
Hozuki for a minute, you dog!

200
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:47,564
I didn't do anything!

201
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:49,482
‐‐[SANE, CHIKA yelling]
‐‐Good morning! Uh, hey.

202
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:51,693
What's up with all
the shouting, guys?

203
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:54,028
[SANE yelling]

204
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,822
[CHIKA] I won't mention the
part where I accidentally

205
00:10:55,864 --> 00:10:57,240
touched her chest
when I caught her.

206
00:10:57,282 --> 00:10:59,117
[TAKEZO] Listen. I have
the performance order

207
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:00,118
for the festival.

208
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,120
Oh, what's our number?

209
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:05,331
It looks like we're
number 24 out of 33 groups.

210
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:08,793
At a tournament, all the
schools play one after another.

211
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:11,212
After that, the judges
give us scores,

212
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:12,881
which determine our rank.

213
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:14,674
[TAKEZO]
For right now,

214
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:17,468
we just need to focus
on what's ahead.

215
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,929
Let's give these last
few practices our all.

216
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:21,472
[MITTSU, SANE, KOTA]
Yeah!

217
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:28,271
[TAKEZO] Before we knew it,
it was time for the big event.

218
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:30,481
No way.

219
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,483
There's a crap ton of people!

220
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:33,693
[SANE]
It kind of feels like we're

221
00:11:33,735 --> 00:11:35,612
the only guys here, though.

222
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:38,990
[TAKEZO] Well, koto clubs are
80 to 90 percent female.

223
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:40,366
What? Are you serious?

224
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:41,826
Isn't that obvious?

225
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:43,036
Where have you been?

226
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:45,121
[OUSUKE]
If it isn't the Tokise gang!

227
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:46,122
[MITTSU, SANE, KOTA, CHIKA gasp]

228
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:48,374
Hey, it's that dude
from Meiryo High!

229
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:52,503
Known as the koto club prince,
My name's Ousuke Kiryu!

230
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:55,340
[SANE] Hold up. You guys
are in this festival, too?

231
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:56,299
Yep, that's right!

232
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:57,300
[CHIKA]
Wait.

233
00:11:57,342 --> 00:12:00,428
I thought you guys were also
participating in nationals.

234
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:01,888
How'd you do?

235
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:04,474
We lost big time!

236
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:06,768
But at least we placed
in the top four.

237
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:09,437
The club in first place
was really good.

238
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:10,939
By the way, Himesaka's also‐‐

239
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,066
You're here!

240
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:16,194
Satowa! Guess what,
we placed in the top four!

241
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:17,528
Isn't that impressive?

242
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:18,613
But I know if we had you,

243
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:20,573
then we could take
first place next time!

244
00:12:20,615 --> 00:12:21,866
[CHIKA]
Denied.

245
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:25,495
Ew, gross, barbarian alert!

246
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:27,705
I suppose you'll be
playing today as well?

247
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,332
Yeah, but why do you care?

248
00:12:29,374 --> 00:12:30,458
Oh, I don't.

249
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,418
I was only wondering
how much you suck.

250
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,254
As I recall at the
joint practice,

251
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:35,546
you said all you had to do was

252
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:37,465
catch up to the
mega talented Satowa.

253
00:12:37,507 --> 00:12:38,675
An ape said that.

254
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:40,134
An ape said that!

255
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:42,845
Your insults are as
stupid as your hair.

256
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:48,017
Bye, Satowa! Good luck!

257
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:49,394
[CHIKA growling]

258
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:50,645
[KOU]
Ousuke.

259
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:52,772
You need to hurry.

260
00:12:52,814 --> 00:12:55,483
Asano and Yoshiki
are asking for you.

261
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:57,277
Asa and Yoshi need me?

262
00:12:58,278 --> 00:12:59,946
[OUSUKE]
Well, I should go.

263
00:12:59,988 --> 00:13:01,990
Our group is first up
to perform, anyway.

264
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:03,449
Whoa, seriously?

265
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:05,034
[OUSUKE]
I heard going first isn't great

266
00:13:05,076 --> 00:13:06,869
because you become the
standard for the judges,

267
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:09,747
so I was initially
pretty bummed about it.

268
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:10,915
But then I thought,

269
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:12,208
there's no problem as long as we

270
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,127
outshine everyone
who comes after us!

271
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:16,004
Ta‐dah, problem solved!

272
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:19,215
Later!

273
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:24,595
[SANE] So he says, as he
nonchalantly skips away.

274
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:29,934
[ASANO sighs] Honestly,
what is that Ousuke up to now?

275
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:32,061
Maybe he was chatting
up a cute girl?

276
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:33,229
Who knows?

277
00:13:33,271 --> 00:13:36,357
I kind of miss the days
when he young and innocent.

278
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:39,485
Still, he has an amazing talent.

279
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:41,696
The way he changes
the atmosphere‐‐

280
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:43,531
A piece can shift.

281
00:13:43,573 --> 00:13:46,743
And Ousuke's solos have
always been spectacular.

282
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:48,578
But I don't know
anyone more capable

283
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:51,914
of bringing out another person's
strengths in an ensemble.

284
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:56,377
[SANE]
Is this the concert hall?

285
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:58,463
[MITTSU]
Makes me kinda nervous.

286
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:05,595
[CHIKA]
No way.

287
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:08,848
Do all the people in here
really play the koto?

288
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:11,768
[TAKEZO]
Mm. It's pretty cool, isn't it?

289
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,522
[ANNOUNCER] Now starting:
the High School Students'

290
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:20,526
Kanto Region Traditional
Japanese Music Festival.

291
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:21,569
Hey, Hozuki.

292
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:24,530
Does the program say
what song they're playing?

293
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:25,907
"Hyakkafu."

294
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:27,533
Is it difficult?

295
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:30,536
It is. Both the rhythm
and technique are tough.

296
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:33,456
It's a piece that is supposed
to describe the four seasons,

297
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:36,000
and Winter is
especially challenging.

298
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:39,170
[SATOWA] The nationals
weren't that long ago,

299
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:42,382
which means they made it into
the top four with this song.

300
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:46,094
[SATOWA] Just what kind
of performance is it?

301
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:49,180
[MEMBER]
Is everyone ready? Here we go!

302
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:55,019
[ANNOUNCER]
First on the program.

303
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:57,814
I present Meiryo High School.

304
00:14:57,855 --> 00:15:00,942
They'll be performing
"Hyakkafu."

305
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:09,826
[koto playing]

306
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:18,126
[TAKEZO]
Whoa.

307
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:20,002
What on earth?

308
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:22,547
[HIRO]
Unbelievable. These guys...

309
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:25,883
[SANE]
So this is an ensemble.

310
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,427
[SATOWA]
Amazing.

311
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:29,679
Even with this many
people and this rhythm,

312
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,973
it doesn't feel like
they're "fitting together."

313
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:34,267
They're just naturally together.

314
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:36,018
The more people in an ensemble,

315
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:39,188
the more differences you get
in tone quality and rhythm.

316
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:40,648
That's why, in order
to sound together,

317
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:44,902
most groups tend to play at a
fixed tempo with set dynamics.

318
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,905
They manage to sing,
even with a large group.

00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:51,826
[SATOWA]
No. That's not it.

320
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:54,704
[SATOWA]
It's that boy.

321
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:58,040
He's leading them in a way
that allows them all to sing.

322
00:16:02,003 --> 00:16:04,338
[SANE] Hozuki's notes
are close to perfect.

323
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,799
And ours make 'em
sound like trash.

324
00:16:06,841 --> 00:16:08,676
[SATOWA]
As of a right now,

325
00:16:08,718 --> 00:16:11,345
that's a skill that
I'm incapable of.

326
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:19,061
[SATOWA]
Summer. That's the first solo.

327

[CHIKA]
What the hell?

328
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:32,658
Is it just me, or is this
guy's sound kind of...

329
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,118
[TAKEZO]
At first, I thought the melody

330
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,121
was really beautiful,
but now it's...

331
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:42,335
[SATOWA] At this point
the sound is...

332
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:43,920
[ALL]
...piercing.

333
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,304
And when my mom found
out what happened,

334
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:54,514

Um...

Good morning.

Huh? Who are you again?

Oh, you're the kid who's been

hospitalized this whole time.

What do you want to do
after we get done?

Let's go outside!

soccer, you wanna come, too?

Ugh, we got yelled
at by the teacher

because you couldn't keep up.

[OUSUKE]
I hate this.

Nobody's ever gonna want
to play with me again.

[ASANO'S MOM]
Hello there.

358
00:18:08,004 --> 00:18:10,923
We're the Izumi family,
we just moved in next door.

359
00:18:10,965 --> 00:18:12,675
This is my daughter, Asano.

360
00:18:12,717 --> 00:18:15,177
Hi, Ousuke! Wanna be friends?

361
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:18,514
[OUSUKE'S MOM]
I'm sorry, Asano, dear,

362
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:21,642
but Ousuke's been in poor
health his whole life.

363
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:26,022
[ASANO]
Ousuke, you there?

Come and play!

365
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:31,611
Guess what? I was
trying to figure out

366
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:33,696
a new place for us to
hang out and have fun,

367
00:18:33,738 --> 00:18:36,782
and I found a really cool
spot not far from here!

368
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:39,160
Uh, okay, but...

Ta‐dah!

00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:41,954
It's a koto school!

If we do this, it'll be
safe for you to play, too!

boyfriend and girlfriend?

[BOY D]
That's so gross!

378
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,194
Well, you're stupid.

379
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:15,988
It's okay, Ousuke, don't even
worry about those dumb jerks.

380
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,365
Let's go!

381
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:23,663
I don't understand those
guys. What's the point...

382
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:25,289
[OUSUKE]
This isn't right.

383
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:28,376
She had to put up with
that, all because of me!

384
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:32,171
[OUSUKE]
I should leave her alone.

[ASANO]
Ousuke. It'll be fine.

387
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:42,014
[OUSUKE]
I don't... want to leave.

388
00:19:42,056 --> 00:19:44,975
But if I'm gonna be with
Asa without hurting her,

389
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:47,728
then I need to really
think things through.

390
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:50,147
I need to watch and
understand people.

391
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:51,190
But don't get too close,

392
00:19:51,232 --> 00:19:53,275
so they can't get
the best of me.

393
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:55,736
I'll come off as somebody
they shouldn't mess with,

394
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:58,948
and learn how to figure out
their thoughts and weaknesses.

395
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:00,408
Before I knew it,

396
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:03,035
I was able to read people
more than others could,

397
00:20:03,077 --> 00:20:06,497
and I started to hear
all their sounds.

Ousuke.

403
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:32,314
You really do know how to
bring out people's strengths.

404
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:34,191
I see that clearly now.

405
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:36,610
[YOSHIKI]
When someone plays with you,

406
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:38,946
you have this way of
making them better.

407
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:41,991
Even though I'm the coach,
I can't compare to that.

How do you do it?

409
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:46,370
[OUSUKE] I'm not really
doing anything special.

410

I guess I just understand
the person I'm playing with.

411
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:50,541
I listen to their sound,

412
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,251
and if there's something
I can do to help them,

413
00:20:52,293 --> 00:20:54,086
then I'll do that.

You're wrong, Yoshi.

The reason's not
as pure as that.

The truth is...

ending up alone again
