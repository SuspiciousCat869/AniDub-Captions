00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,222
-FLAWLESS.
SHE'S THE WINNER.

318
00:17:38,222 --> 00:17:39,522
-YES!

319
00:17:39,522 --> 00:17:41,322
-CONGRATULATIONS, FREYA.

320
00:17:41,322 --> 00:17:42,788
MY LOVE BELONGS TO YOU.

321
00:17:46,955 --> 00:17:49,622
-SO, SHE REALLY DID WIN.

322
00:17:49,622 --> 00:17:52,922
WHICH MEANS THE RUNNER-UP --
AAH!

323
00:17:55,122 --> 00:17:56,622
-OKAY.

324
00:17:56,622 --> 00:17:59,155
-UNFORTUNATELY, THIS YEAR,
NO ONE QUALIFIED FOR RUNNER-UP,

325
00:17:59,155 --> 00:18:01,422
AND, WITH THAT,
I DECLARE THE COMPETITION OVER.

326
00:18:04,788 --> 00:18:05,822
-IT'S OVER.

327
00:18:05,822 --> 00:18:07,222
-OH, THAT'S RIGHT!

00:18:09,055 --> 00:18:11,655
-LOVE ONLY ME, FREYA.

330
00:18:11,655 --> 00:18:14,722
I WANT YOU TO HATE
EVERYBODY ELSE.

331
00:18:14,722 --> 00:18:16,855
YOUR HEART IS YOUNG
AND BEAUTIFUL.

332
00:18:16,855 --> 00:18:21,388
DYED BLACK,
IT GIVES OFF A STRONG FRAGRANCE.

333
00:18:21,388 --> 00:18:23,422
YOU'LL GIVE IT TO ME, WON'T YOU?

334
00:18:23,422 --> 00:18:25,822
-I WILL.

335
00:18:25,822 --> 00:18:27,255
-DANCE, FREYA.

336
00:18:27,255 --> 00:18:29,255
DANCE AS PROOF
OF YOUR LOVE FOR ME

337
00:18:29,255 --> 00:18:32,122
AND GIVE ME YOUR HEART.
-GIVE ME YOUR HEART.

BETWEEN MYTHO AND ME?

00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:18,088
I WON'T HAVE IT!

347
00:19:20,755 --> 00:19:21,988
-MS. FREYA!

348
00:19:21,988 --> 00:19:24,555
-YES, THAT'S IT,
MY LITTLE FLOWER.

349
00:19:24,555 --> 00:19:27,255
COME INTO MY ARMS, FREYA.

350
00:19:28,122 --> 00:19:31,055
-PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER, MYTHO!

351
00:19:31,055 --> 00:19:35,222
-MS. FREYA, IS THAT LOVE REAL?

352
00:19:35,222 --> 00:19:40,155
WEREN'T FLOWERS YOUR HOPE,
YOUR PRAYER, YOUR WISH?

353
00:19:40,155 --> 00:19:41,255
-YOU'RE RIGHT.

354
00:19:41,255 --> 00:19:44,422
THAT IS WHAT I DESIRE,
WHAT I PRAY FOR.

355
00:19:44,422 --> 00:19:45,555
NOW LOOK AROUND.

356
00:19:45,555 --> 00:19:47,522
SEE HOW MANY HAVE BLOOMED?

357
00:19:47,522 --> 00:19:50,322
-IS THIS REALLY WHAT YOU
WANTED THEM TO LOOK LIKE?

358
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:53,688
LISTEN CLOSELY TO THE VOICES
OF THE FLOWERS YOU LOVE.

359
00:19:53,688 --> 00:19:57,288
-THE FLOWERS' VOICES?
I CAN'T.

360
00:19:57,288 --> 00:19:59,355
I CAN'T HEAR THEM.

361
00:19:59,355 --> 00:20:00,988
-WATCH.
WATCH TUTU'S DANCE.

-I CAN'T HEAR THEM.

I CAN'T HEAR
THE FLOWERS' VOICES.

364
00:20:04,888 --> 00:20:06,422
-DON'T GIVE UP.

365
00:20:07,188 --> 00:20:08,188
REMEMBER.

366
00:20:08,188 --> 00:20:11,588
REMEMBER YOUR PRAYER.

367
00:20:19,855 --> 00:20:21,422
-MY PRAYER.

368
00:20:21,422 --> 00:20:25,322
-YES, YOUR PRAYER
FOR EVERYBODY TO BE HAPPY.

369
00:20:25,322 --> 00:20:29,855
THAT WAS WHAT YOU WISHED FOR,
WASN'T IT, MS. FREYA?

370
00:20:33,722 --> 00:20:37,288
-OH, I HEAR THEM,
THE FLOWERS' VOICES.

371
00:20:41,455 --> 00:20:42,588
-MYTHO, REMEMBER!

372
00:20:42,588 --> 00:20:45,988
-WHY WON'T YOU LOVE ME?
WHY?

373
00:20:45,988 --> 00:20:49,955
-MYTHO, REMEMBER YOUR REAL SELF!

-THE WAY YOU ARE NOW
IS THE REAL MYTHO.

379
00:21:01,188 --> 00:21:04,288
-KRAEHE,
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO MYTHO?

380
00:21:04,288 --> 00:21:08,388
-THE ONE WHO MADE THE PRINCE
LIKE THIS IS YOU, TUTU.

381
00:21:08,388 --> 00:21:09,688
-STOP IT.
-AFTER ALL,

382
00:21:09,688 --> 00:21:12,622
YOU RETURNED THE FEELING OF LOVE
TO THE PRINCE

383
00:21:12,622 --> 00:21:16,722
IGNORANT OF THE FACT THAT IT WAS
DYED IN THE RAVEN'S BLOOD.

384
00:21:16,722 --> 00:21:19,222
YOU DIDN'T TELL HER, FAKIR?

385
00:21:21,955 --> 00:21:24,288
I'M FOREVER IN YOUR DEBT, TUTU.

386
00:21:30,555 --> 00:21:32,355
-MYTHO.

387

-HEY.

00:21:33,855 --> 00:21:37,022
ARE YOU ANGRY WITH ME
BECAUSE I KEPT IT FROM YOU?

-A LITTLE.
-I'M SORRY, DUCK.
