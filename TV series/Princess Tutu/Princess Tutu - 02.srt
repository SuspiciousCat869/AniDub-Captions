1
00:00:02,803 --> 00:00:04,204
‐ [Narrator] Once upon a time,

2
00:00:04,204 --> 00:00:06,907
there was man who died.

3
00:00:06,907 --> 00:00:08,075
(gentle, eerie music)

4
00:00:08,075 --> 00:00:09,376
The last story the
man was writing

5
00:00:09,376 --> 00:00:12,246
was about a brave
and handsome prince

6
00:00:12,246 --> 00:00:14,982
who vanquishes a crafty raven.

7
00:00:16,817 --> 00:00:20,153
When the man died, the
raven and the prince

8
00:00:20,153 --> 00:00:22,956
escaped from within the story.

9
00:00:22,956 --> 00:00:28,662
The prince took out his own
heart to seal away the raven.

10
00:00:28,662 --> 00:00:32,432
But this power, which had
been granted solely to him,

11
00:00:32,432 --> 00:00:36,136
was nevertheless forbidden.

12
00:00:36,136 --> 00:00:40,340
Thus sealed, the raven
troubled them no more.

13
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:43,010
But the prince's
heart was shattered,

14
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:46,213
and the shards
scattered all over town.

15
00:00:47,581 --> 00:00:51,285
Ever since then, stories
and reality have intermingled

16
00:00:51,285 --> 00:00:52,619
in the town,

17
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:55,055
making it a world
where the fantastical

18
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:57,324
was no longer fantastical.

19
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:05,399
(sweet, melodic music)

20
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:20,714
(singing in foreign language)

21
00:02:29,383 --> 00:02:32,819
(classical dance music)

22
00:02:51,071 --> 00:02:52,205
<i>‐ A dream?</i>

23
00:02:52,205 --> 00:02:54,141
<i>Where am I?</i>

24
00:02:54,141 --> 00:02:55,842
<i>What am I doing here?</i>

25
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:00,313
<i>(squawks)</i>

26
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:01,848
<i>(fearful exclaiming)</i>

27
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:05,952
<i>No way, no way, no way,</i>
<i>no way, no way, no way.</i>

28
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,059
<i>I'm just a duck.</i>

29
00:03:12,059 --> 00:03:14,628
<i>And I thought I was a girl.</i>

30
00:03:14,628 --> 00:03:18,331
<i>When I saved</i>
<i>Senor Mytho, was that a dream?</i>

31
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:20,200
<i>Could this be</i>
<i>a dream right now?</i>

32
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,735
(evil laughter)

33
00:03:21,735 --> 00:03:23,270
‐ [Drosselmeyer]
If you must know,

34
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:26,306
neither is a dream, little duck.
(cackles evilly)

35
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:28,375
(duck screams)

36
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,177
(splashing)
(duck wails)

37
00:03:30,177 --> 00:03:31,511
‐ Who are you?

38
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:34,281
‐ [Man] You may address
me as Drossermeyer.

39
00:03:34,281 --> 00:03:36,550
(laughs evilly)

40
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:40,821
Do you want to save the poor
prince who's lost his heart?

41
00:03:40,821 --> 00:03:43,457
‐ The person I want
to save is Senor Mytho.

42
00:03:43,457 --> 00:03:45,292
‐ The prince was
a wholehearted hero

43
00:03:45,292 --> 00:03:46,993
who fought the demonic raven.

44
00:03:46,993 --> 00:03:50,397
Well, he was when they were
still inside the story.

45
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:51,932
‐ Inside the story?

46
00:03:51,932 --> 00:03:54,768
‐ Yes, he came out
of the story I wrote

47
00:03:54,768 --> 00:03:58,705
and ended up losing his
heart to seal the raven away.

48
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:01,274
Shattered to pieces,
his lost heart now wanders

49
00:04:01,274 --> 00:04:02,976
as a handful of shards.

50
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:07,180
And Princess Tutu's the only
one who can restore his heart.

51
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,282
‐ Princess Tutu?

52
00:04:09,282 --> 00:04:10,951
‐ If you have the
necessary resolve,

53
00:04:10,951 --> 00:04:13,754
I will turn you into
a girl once more.

54
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:14,921
‐ A girl?

55
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:17,491
I'll really get
to see Senor Mytho again?

56
00:04:17,491 --> 00:04:20,393
‐ If you have
the resolve, that is.

57
00:04:20,393 --> 00:04:22,095
‐ I do, I do!

58
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:26,133
If I could be a girl again,
and stay by Senor Mytho's side,

59
00:04:26,133 --> 00:04:29,803
maybe someday, someday I
might be able to put a smile

60
00:04:29,803 --> 00:04:31,404
back on his face.

61
00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:33,740
And if that's the
one thing I can do,

62
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:36,810
then there's nothing more
that I could wish for.

63
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:38,311
‐ Congratulations.

64
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:41,481
Dream and your wish is granted.

65
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:44,217
That's the great
thing about stories.

66
00:04:44,217 --> 00:04:45,452
The duck will become a girl

67
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:46,787
(bell tinkling)

68
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:50,056
and the girl will
become Princess Tutu.

69
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:51,258
(dramatically rising music)

70
00:04:51,258 --> 00:04:54,427
Stories are such
wonderful creatures.

71
00:04:54,427 --> 00:04:57,864
But remember this:
if you say or do anything

72
00:04:57,864 --> 00:04:59,332
resembling a duck

73
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:02,269
(duck whimpers)

74
00:05:02,269 --> 00:05:05,105
you'll just remember that.

75
00:05:05,105 --> 00:05:07,774
(laughs evilly)

76
00:05:16,383 --> 00:05:19,953
(bells ringing)

77
00:05:19,953 --> 00:05:22,589
‐ This is Gulgron Town.

78
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:26,026
And I'm‐‐

79
00:05:26,026 --> 00:05:27,027
(screams)

80
00:05:27,027 --> 00:05:28,094
a duck?

81
00:05:28,094 --> 00:05:31,198
(quacks excitedly)

82
00:05:31,198 --> 00:05:32,866
I am a duck.

83
00:05:32,866 --> 00:05:33,967
(sighs)

84
00:05:33,967 --> 00:05:37,904
So, Senor Mytho and the
prince were all a dream.

85
00:05:37,904 --> 00:05:39,606
Of course.

86
00:05:39,606 --> 00:05:41,041
(splashes and sighs)

87
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:45,045
It's so calming
to be on the water.

88
00:05:45,045 --> 00:05:47,480
(splashes and squawks)

89
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,016
(loud splashing)

90
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:51,484
(gasps)

91
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:55,121
‐ [Man] If you say or do
anything resembling a duck.

92
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:57,090
‐ Oh, this is.

93
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:58,625
It wasn't a dream.

94
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:07,734
(sprightly music)

95
00:06:13,273 --> 00:06:17,110
‐ May those who accept their
fate be granted happiness.

96
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:20,513
May those who defy
it be granted glory.

97
00:06:20,513 --> 00:06:21,882
‐ Who's that?

98
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:23,583
‐ I am Ederu.

99
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,218
You are Duck.

100
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:26,820
‐ [Girl] You know about me?

101
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,823
‐ Even as girl, you still
have some duck‐like qualities

102
00:06:29,823 --> 00:06:31,491
about you, don't you.

103
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:32,492
‐ [Girl] What?

104
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:33,493
‐ The way you look.

105
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:35,128
‐ [Girl] The way I look?

106
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:39,099
‐ Think of it as having all
of your feathers plucked out.

107
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:40,400
(screams)

108
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,469
(splashing)

109
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:44,004
These are for you.

110
00:06:45,438 --> 00:06:48,875
‐ So, if I'm a
duck, as in a bird,

111
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:51,978
since when was the girl
me, the me that I am?

112
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:54,648
Or rather, yesterday
me and two days ago me,

113
00:06:54,648 --> 00:06:56,483
and the me before
that are all me's, so.

114
00:06:56,483 --> 00:06:58,118
Wait.

115
00:06:58,118 --> 00:06:59,252
Now, I'm really lost.

116
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:02,355
‐ A story's birth
is a sudden event

117
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:04,758
to start a happy accident.

118
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:07,193
The end, the fate
for which it's meant.

119
00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:10,263
A story that never
ends is a cruel thing.

120
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:11,698
(girl sighs)

121
00:07:11,698 --> 00:07:15,635
‐ I'm afraid you lost
me too, Miss Ederu.

122
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:18,238
‐ Let us meet again.

123
00:07:18,238 --> 00:07:19,539
‐ Yes.

124
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:22,242
(bells tolling)

125
00:07:22,242 --> 00:07:24,911
(clock chiming)

126
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:34,154
(chattering gibberish)

127
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:43,063
‐ Senor Mytho.

128
00:07:45,098 --> 00:07:49,669
<i>I turned into Princess Tutu</i>
<i>and saved Senor Mytho, right?</i>

129
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:52,572
<i>I wonder if he remembers.</i>

130
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:54,874
Even if he did,
he wouldn't know it was me.

131
00:07:54,874 --> 00:07:56,343
(sighs)

132
00:07:56,343 --> 00:07:59,713
Oh, what if he found out I was
a duck, like the actual bird.

133
00:07:59,713 --> 00:08:01,081
Duck, you're the worst.

134
00:08:01,081 --> 00:08:03,950
No wonder you talk like
a duck, shoo, shoo.

135
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:06,653
Or, man, you stink like a bird.

136
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:09,189
Or, my favorite, let's dig in.

137
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:11,591
(whimpers)

138
00:08:11,591 --> 00:08:13,259
I'll keep it secret.

139
00:08:15,729 --> 00:08:16,730
(bird singing)

140
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:18,164
Senor Mytho.

141
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:20,266
That thing about the
prince who lost his heart.

142
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:24,037
Oh, I haven't made him an
apology for his leg yet.

143
00:08:24,037 --> 00:08:25,238
I must go.

144
00:08:31,311 --> 00:08:32,545
(sprightly music)

145
00:08:32,545 --> 00:08:35,315
Well, you see, um, I'm so sorry.

146
00:08:35,315 --> 00:08:37,350
‐ [Prince] What?
‐ Your leg.

147
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,451
Is your leg still hurting you?

148
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:39,486
‐ [Prince] Not really.

149
00:08:39,486 --> 00:08:41,121
‐ So it's all better now?

150
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:42,288
Thank goodness!

151
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:45,025
(shaky laugh)

152
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:46,159
‐ [Duck Voiceover]
<i>I have to say something.</i>

153
00:08:50,163 --> 00:08:51,898
You reading a book?

154
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:52,899
‐ [Duck Voiceover]
<i>Of course he is.</i>

155
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:53,900
<i>Look, what am I saying?</i>

156
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,835
‐ You like books, then?

157
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:57,370
‐ [Duck Voiceover]
<i>Oh, great, I'm a snob.</i>

158
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,671
Is the book interesting?

159
00:08:58,671 --> 00:09:00,073
‐ [Duck Voiceover]
<i>Of course it is.</i>

160
00:09:00,073 --> 00:09:01,941
<i>He wouldn't read</i>
<i>it if it wasn't.</i>

161
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:04,110
‐ [Prince] Not really.
‐ Huh?

162
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:07,680
‐ I don't know if I particularly
like or dislike books.

163
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,416
‐ [Girl Voiceover]
<i>There they are again.</i>

164
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:10,884
<i>Those lonely eyes.</i>

165
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:12,619
‐ [Rue] Good day, Mytho.

166
00:09:12,619 --> 00:09:14,354
‐ Oh, hi, Rue!

167
00:09:14,354 --> 00:09:16,022
(strange sounds)

168
00:09:16,022 --> 00:09:19,092
(dramatic music)

169
00:09:19,092 --> 00:09:22,162
[Duck Voiceover] <i>Anteater?</i>
<i>An animal that eats ants?</i>

170
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:25,465
<i>Why an anteater?</i>

171
00:09:25,465 --> 00:09:26,466
<i>Okay, I'm a duck, but‐‐</i>

172
00:09:26,466 --> 00:09:29,569
‐ May I take a seat next to you?

173
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,671
‐ Sure.

174
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:34,374
‐ What exactly are your
thoughts on Miss Rue?

175
00:09:34,374 --> 00:09:35,675
‐ I don't know.

176
00:09:35,675 --> 00:09:37,677
‐ You do love her, don't you?

177
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:39,179
‐ [Prince] Not really.

178
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:41,915
‐ And, might I ask you
to be with me instead?

179
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:44,284
Would you be averse to it?

180
00:09:44,284 --> 00:09:45,819
‐ [Prince] Not really.

181
00:09:45,819 --> 00:09:47,153
‐ [Duck Voiceover] <i>No way.</i>

182
00:09:47,153 --> 00:09:49,656
‐ Mytho.

183
00:09:49,656 --> 00:09:51,558
‐ [Duck Voiceover]
<i>Eugh, she licked him.</i>

184
00:09:51,558 --> 00:09:53,259
Ah! Excuse me.

185
00:09:55,829 --> 00:09:58,431
(stirring music)

186
00:09:58,431 --> 00:09:59,365
Quack!

187
00:10:02,402 --> 00:10:05,338
Quack quack!

188
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:06,873
‐ [Girl Voiceover]
<i>You can't come this way!</i>

189
00:10:10,577 --> 00:10:12,011
<i>I can't do this as a duck.</i>

190
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:13,847
<i>How do I go back</i>
<i>to being a girl?</i>

191
00:10:13,847 --> 00:10:15,048
<i>Oh, what'd I do last time.</i>

192
00:10:15,048 --> 00:10:16,916
<i>That's right, water.</i>

193
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,358
I did it, woo.

194
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:27,594
Whoa! I can't go
out naked like this.

195
00:10:27,594 --> 00:10:29,262
Now what? Oh, quack!

196
00:10:30,497 --> 00:10:33,233
(stirring music)

197
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:43,143
Hey, um, um.

198
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:45,945
‐ Oh look, if it isn't Ms. Rue.

199
00:10:47,447 --> 00:10:50,283
Please allow me the
pleasure of informing you

200
00:10:50,283 --> 00:10:53,286
that Mytho is going
to accompany me now.

201
00:10:53,286 --> 00:10:54,454
‐ What?

202
00:10:54,454 --> 00:10:57,724
‐ It seems quite clear
who the winner is here.

203
00:10:57,724 --> 00:10:59,759
Excuse us.

204
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:01,661
‐ No, no.
Don't listen to her.

205
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:02,795
I'm pretty sure it's not true.

206
00:11:02,795 --> 00:11:03,897
That wasn't for real, so it's‐‐

207
00:11:03,897 --> 00:11:05,098
‐ Doesn't bother me.

208
00:11:05,098 --> 00:11:05,899
‐ What?

209
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:06,933
‐ Thank you, though.

210
00:11:06,933 --> 00:11:08,301
You're so sweet.

211
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,271
‐ I...

212
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:17,277
(women talking)

213
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:22,348
‐ What, need you ask?

214
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,250
Dumping Rue like that?

215
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,552
You're terrible.

216
00:11:25,552 --> 00:11:27,086
‐ Am I really?

217
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:29,389
‐ Because you don't
understand how people feel.

218
00:11:29,389 --> 00:11:32,258
It's why you do things like
that, without a thought.

219
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:33,293
‐ I'm sorry.

220
00:11:33,293 --> 00:11:36,296
‐ Idiot, that's
how it should be.

221
00:11:36,296 --> 00:11:39,098
‐ With ballet, take a day
off, and you will know.

222
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:41,067
Take three days off,
and your peers will know.

223
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:43,970
Take a week off, and
the audience will know.

224
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:46,039
As this adage
aptly demonstrates,

225
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:48,174
daily practice is
of the utmost importance,

226
00:11:48,174 --> 00:11:50,376
and so, we will have
a test once a month

227
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:53,046
from now on to assign
you to a class.

228
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:54,847
In the worst case,
you'll be dropped

229
00:11:54,847 --> 00:11:56,950
to the probationary class.

230
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,718
‐ What? Probation?

231
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:02,188
‐ That or I will
have you marry me.

232
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:03,323
‐ What? No way!

233
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:07,093
‐ No, no way?

234
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:11,097
‐ Mr. Cat.

235
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:13,233
‐ [Cat] What, Ms. Anteater Ena?

236
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:15,668
‐ This special class is
strictly capped at five.

237
00:12:15,668 --> 00:12:17,337
‐ [Cat] Yes? So?

238
00:12:17,337 --> 00:12:19,572
‐ Then I suppose someone
will have to be dropped

239
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,241
to make room for me.

240
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,945
‐ A declaration of war.

241
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:28,948
‐ Taking not just a
lover, but a status, too.

242
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:30,550
‐ [Both] How exciting.

243
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:33,353
‐ To prove my worthiness,
I shall dance a pas de deux

244
00:12:33,353 --> 00:12:34,354
with my partner.

245
00:12:34,354 --> 00:12:36,856
Come, Mytho.

246
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:39,292
‐ What?

247
00:12:39,292 --> 00:12:41,995
‐ [Both] Wow, an even more
exciting turn of events.

248
00:12:41,995 --> 00:12:43,296
‐ This can't be.

249
00:12:43,296 --> 00:12:46,199
(orchestra music)

250
00:12:52,038 --> 00:12:54,240
(orchestra music)

251
00:13:00,246 --> 00:13:02,849
(ballet music)

252
00:13:13,059 --> 00:13:15,094
‐ Guess it wasn't all talk, huh?

253
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:17,297
‐ A woman's battle.

254
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:19,899
(ballet music)

255
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:34,881
‐ [Duck Voiceover] She's
definitely good, but somehow,

256
00:13:34,881 --> 00:13:37,517
there's no joy in it.

257
00:13:37,517 --> 00:13:40,119
(ballet music)

258
00:13:49,796 --> 00:13:52,131
‐ [All Together] Wow.

259
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:54,067
‐ Miss Rue, I would
very much like to see

260
00:13:54,067 --> 00:13:57,136
your pas de deux,
but whether or not

261
00:13:57,136 --> 00:14:00,273
there is an actual
partner for you...

262
00:14:01,641 --> 00:14:02,675
‐ That was mean.

263
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:03,776
‐ Rue is in a pinch.

264
00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:06,913
‐ A pinch.

265
00:14:06,913 --> 00:14:08,548
‐ Would you dance with me?

266
00:14:08,548 --> 00:14:10,049
‐ What?

267
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:12,385
Huh? Huh? Me?

268
00:14:12,385 --> 00:14:13,186
‐ That's right.

269
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:14,387
‐ [Both] Dance with her.

270
00:14:14,387 --> 00:14:16,756
‐ What?

271
00:14:16,756 --> 00:14:19,625
(children talking)

272
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,928
‐ Rue, you know,
I'm really terrible at this.

273
00:14:21,928 --> 00:14:24,097
I don't think I'm gonna
be any good to you at all.

274
00:14:24,097 --> 00:14:25,365
‐ Don't worry.

275
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:28,468
Just follow my
directions, all right?

276
00:14:31,237 --> 00:14:32,672
Don't be nervous.

277
00:14:32,672 --> 00:14:33,840
‐ Oh, okay.

278
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,508
‐ Wait 'till she messes up.

279
00:14:35,508 --> 00:14:36,509
‐ Yeah.

280
00:14:36,509 --> 00:14:37,510
‐ A storm's brewing.

281
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:38,945
‐ Yeah.

282
00:14:38,945 --> 00:14:41,547
(ballet music)

283
00:15:02,969 --> 00:15:05,004
‐ Now jump.
‐ Huh?

284
00:15:41,741 --> 00:15:44,076
(clapping)

285
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:49,549
(applause)

286
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:52,952
‐ You were wonderful.

287
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,320
‐ Really?

288
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,988
‐ It's almost like
she wasn't Duck?

289
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:56,989
‐ You're right.

290
00:15:56,989 --> 00:15:59,425
That wasn't Duck at all.

291
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:01,527
(applause)

292
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:09,001
‐ You think nothing of
the humiliation that I,

293
00:16:09,001 --> 00:16:10,803
your girlfriend,
just went through?

294
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,038
‐ Not really.

295
00:16:12,038 --> 00:16:14,207
‐ Did you not do
your best on purpose?

296
00:16:14,207 --> 00:16:15,241
‐ I don't know.

297
00:16:15,241 --> 00:16:16,976
‐ Do not mock me.

298
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:20,346
Just so you are aware, if you
had not been Rue's boyfriend,

299
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:23,449
I would not have asked
you out the first place.

300
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:25,251
Goodbye.

301
00:16:25,251 --> 00:16:26,919
Have you come to laugh at me?

302
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:28,387
‐ No, I wouldn't.

303
00:16:30,923 --> 00:16:32,225
Wait.

304
00:16:32,225 --> 00:16:34,327
‐ Leave me alone!

305
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:35,695
‐ What's going on?

306
00:16:35,695 --> 00:16:37,597
Anteater Ena!

307
00:16:37,597 --> 00:16:38,664
‐ It's not fair.

308
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,233
Not fair, not fair.

309
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:43,836
It's not fair.

310
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:44,837
‐ I know.

311
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:47,940
Go on and cry.

312
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:50,643
It is unfair.

313
00:16:50,643 --> 00:16:51,777
‐ Senior Mytho?

314
00:16:51,777 --> 00:16:53,446
‐ It is unfair.

315
00:16:53,446 --> 00:16:55,848
‐ [Anteater] It's
so unfair, it hurts.

316
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:57,116
Please stay with me.

317
00:16:57,116 --> 00:16:58,117
‐ Of course.

318
00:16:58,117 --> 00:16:59,118
‐ Wait.

319
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:00,219
What is that?

320
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:02,522
‐ I need you two, Anteater Ena.

321
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:06,125
I need your poor, broken heart.

322
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:07,760
‐ That's...

323
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,129
(bell ringing)

324
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:13,099
‐ [Drosselmeyer] Looks like
you found one of the shards

325
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:15,134
of the prince's lost heart.

326
00:17:15,134 --> 00:17:19,138
Now, reveal the mystery
for me, Princess Tutu.

327
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:24,443
(dramatic orchestra music)

328
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:41,527
‐ Who are you?

329
00:17:42,328 --> 00:17:44,330
Have you come
to laugh at me as well?

330
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:47,133
‐ No, Anteater Ena,
but the one next to you

331
00:17:47,133 --> 00:17:48,734
is not your partner.

332
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,269
‐ Don't be absurd!

333
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:53,673
‐ Please come dance with me.

334
00:17:53,673 --> 00:17:54,740
Anteater Ena.

335
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,008
‐ I refuse.

336
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:59,812
You couldn't possibly
understand how I feel.

337
00:18:05,818 --> 00:18:08,287
(explosions)

338
00:18:09,689 --> 00:18:10,690
Go away!

339
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:12,592
‐ Anteater Ena,

340
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:14,493
is that your way of dancing?

341
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:17,096
‐ Yes, to make your
audience surrender.

342
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:19,198
That is art.

343
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:20,900
‐ But that isn't
how you really feel.

344
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:25,338
‐ Oh no, I believe it from
the bottom of my heart.

345
00:18:26,339 --> 00:18:29,208
This is my way of dancing.

346
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:30,409
‐ Then why,

347
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:32,845
why do you seem
to be in such pain?

348
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:36,048
There's no joy
in your dancing, at all.

349
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:38,050
What are you so bitter about?

350
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:41,487
(dramatic orchestra music)

351
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:42,622
‐ That.

352
00:18:51,998 --> 00:18:53,799
How wonderful.

353
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:57,303
Please tell me, what must I
do to dance so wonderfully?

354
00:18:57,303 --> 00:18:58,871
‐ [Rue Voiceover] I
don't know, practice.

355
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:00,506
‐ [Anteater Voiceover]
I'll work hard.

356
00:19:00,506 --> 00:19:02,441
I'll work hard till I
can dance that well.

357
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:04,310
Just like you, Ms. Rou.

358
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:07,113
‐ You can't. It's not possible.

359
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:12,818
(dramatic orchestra music)

360
00:19:15,588 --> 00:19:18,157
‐ I want to beat Miss Rou,

361
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:21,227
to win by any means necessary.

362
00:19:21,227 --> 00:19:22,695
‐ Those feelings,

363
00:19:22,695 --> 00:19:27,366
those feeling are not
truly yours, Anteater Ena.

364
00:19:27,366 --> 00:19:31,137
(dramatic orchestra music)

365
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:36,275
Forget your
bitterness and hatred.

366
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:38,411
I want to see how
you truly dance.

367
00:19:38,411 --> 00:19:40,446
It will be much more beautiful.

368
00:19:40,446 --> 00:19:42,448
Let us dance together.

369
00:19:46,652 --> 00:19:51,090
To your heart's content,
be honest,

370
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:52,992
be free.

371
00:19:52,992 --> 00:19:59,298
Yes, this is truly
your way of dancing.

372
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:02,401
‐ I feel such joy.

373
00:20:10,242 --> 00:20:11,711
‐ You must be.

374
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:13,946
‐ I'm the feeling
of bitter disappointment,

375
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:15,748
shattered and forgotten.

376
00:20:15,748 --> 00:20:19,085
‐ But this is not the
place to which you belong.

377
00:20:19,085 --> 00:20:20,519
‐ Must I wander again?

378
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:22,354
‐ You need to go back.

379
00:20:22,354 --> 00:20:23,656
‐ Can I go back?

380
00:20:23,656 --> 00:20:26,192
‐ Mm‐hmm.

381
00:20:26,192 --> 00:20:27,793
‐ I'm so glad.

382
00:20:37,803 --> 00:20:38,971
Huh?

383
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:40,372
Huh?

384
00:20:48,948 --> 00:20:51,283
(groaning)

385
00:20:56,188 --> 00:21:01,026
I really and truly have been
able to become Princess Tutu.

386
00:21:01,026 --> 00:21:02,361
‐ Mytho!

387
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:05,397
Mytho.

388
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:08,367
What's wrong, Mytho?

389
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:10,035
‐ What is this feeling?

390
00:21:10,035 --> 00:21:12,071
I don't understand.

391
00:21:12,071 --> 00:21:13,672
‐ A feeling?

392
00:21:17,743 --> 00:21:19,178
‐ Now, then.

393
00:21:19,178 --> 00:21:22,281
The special class will be the
same five people as before.

394
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,516
(applause)

395
00:21:23,516 --> 00:21:25,351
And Ms. Anteater Ena.

396
00:21:25,351 --> 00:21:26,952
‐ Yes.

397
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:29,021
‐ Your performance was good,
but the decision is to wait

398
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:30,556
and see this time around.

399
00:21:30,556 --> 00:21:32,625
‐ Yes, understood.

400
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:35,027
I have decided
to stop copying Ms. Rue

401
00:21:35,027 --> 00:21:37,263
and find my own way of dancing.

402
00:21:37,263 --> 00:21:40,966
‐ I look forward to seeing
it, and as for Ms. Duck...

403
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:42,034
‐ Yes.

404
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:44,170
‐ Your performance
was also quite good.

405
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:45,538
‐ Yes.

406
00:21:45,538 --> 00:21:47,973
‐ However, you owe it
entirely to Ms. Rue.

407
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:52,278
Thus you're assigned
to the probationary class.

408
00:21:53,512 --> 00:21:55,581
‐ [Both] I knew it.

409
00:21:55,581 --> 00:21:57,583
‐ [Drosselmeyer]
<i>You must never forget</i>

410
00:21:57,583 --> 00:22:00,886
<i>that Duck is,</i>
<i>after all, a duck.</i>

411
00:22:00,886 --> 00:22:02,988
(laughing)

412
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:07,493
(uplifting music)

413
00:22:18,304 --> 00:22:22,308
(singing in foreign language)

414
00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:36,048
‐ [Duck] Senior Mytho
is actually a prince

415
00:23:36,048 --> 00:23:37,116
out of a story.

416
00:23:37,116 --> 00:23:39,385
That must be why
he's so handsome.

417
00:23:39,385 --> 00:23:41,453
‐ [Mytho] Rue, I love you.
‐ [Duck] It's Rue.

418
00:23:41,453 --> 00:23:43,689
I wonder if she knows.

419
00:23:43,689 --> 00:23:45,124
‐ [Mytho] Princess Tutu.

420
00:23:45,124 --> 00:23:46,125
‐ This is ridiculous.

421
00:23:46,125 --> 00:23:47,493
That's just a story.

422
00:23:47,493 --> 00:23:49,461
Though blessed with beauty,
cleverness, and strength,

423
00:23:49,461 --> 00:23:52,865
she's still a princess fated
never to be with her prince.

424
00:23:52,865 --> 00:23:54,266
When she confesses her love,

425
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:56,902
she turns into a speck
of light and vanishes.

426
00:23:56,902 --> 00:24:00,005
‐ [Drosselmeyer] All who
love stories gather round.

427
00:24:00,005 --> 00:24:02,408
(laughing)
