1
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:07,474
‐ [Narrator] Once upon
a time there was a sad love

2
00:00:07,474 --> 00:00:10,143
that would never be requited.

3
00:00:10,143 --> 00:00:15,482
But that alone does not
give birth to a story.

4
00:00:15,482 --> 00:00:19,686
The man charged with a task
of spinning this tale of love

5
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:22,923
was no longer of this world.

6
00:00:22,923 --> 00:00:28,328
The story lives on with the
love forever immersed in sorrow.

7
00:00:28,395 --> 00:00:32,232
Having lost its storyteller,
the story is nowZ

8
00:00:32,232 --> 00:00:35,302
wandering in search of its
conclusion.

9
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:45,846
(soft piano music)

10
00:00:54,955 --> 00:00:58,425
(soft singing in Japanese)

11
00:02:09,196 --> 00:02:12,532
(lively classical music)

12
00:02:31,051 --> 00:02:34,955
(lively classical ballet music)

13
00:02:42,062 --> 00:02:43,730
(gasping in awe)

14
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:45,132
(girls sighing)

15
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:54,508
‐ Impressive!
‐ Truly a prodigy!

16
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:57,778
‐ Will a day come when
I can dance like that too?

17
00:02:57,778 --> 00:03:00,080
‐ Whoa, you finally
got your head straight!

18
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,449
‐ What a wildly whimsical dream!

19
00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:04,785
That's the spirit, Duck!

20
00:03:04,785 --> 00:03:06,353
Ballet is your strong suit!

21
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:08,522
Better to dream big right?

22
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:10,223
Then you'll have bigger
failures!

23
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:12,192
‐ Work hard and things work out!

24
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,660
‐ For normal people!

25
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,195
‐ [Both] Yeah well, for now you
gotta get

26
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,698
out of that probationary class!

27
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:24,604
‐ [Duck] <i>That's right,</i>
<i>when I'm Princess Tutu</i>

28
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:27,340
<i>I can dance any dance I want.</i>

29
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:30,644
<i>But is that me</i>
<i>or someone else?</i>

30
00:03:30,644 --> 00:03:33,847
<i>I'm just a girl in the</i>
<i>probationary class.</i>

31
00:03:33,847 --> 00:03:38,118
<i>Or rather, when you get</i>
<i>down to it, I'm just a duck.</i>

32
00:03:38,118 --> 00:03:41,388
<i>Maybe there's no point in me</i>
<i>practicing.</i>

33
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:55,202
(panting in effort)

34
00:04:05,145 --> 00:04:06,313
Watch out!

35
00:04:11,852 --> 00:04:14,087
(gasping in horror)

36
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:16,757
(chimes ringing)

37
00:04:21,328 --> 00:04:22,729
‐ Who are you?

38
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:24,464
Are you calling to me?

39
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:28,401
Fakir‐‐
‐ What's with that look?

40
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:29,336
‐ What look?

41
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,405
‐ What were you thinking?

42
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:33,740
‐ What?

43
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:36,877
‐ Just now, what were you
thinking?

44
00:04:36,877 --> 00:04:39,813
‐ Someone, someone's calling me.

45
00:04:39,813 --> 00:04:42,649
I don't know who it is, but
I feel like I can understand

46
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:46,820
what that person's feeling,
the heartache deep down,

47
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:50,190
a desire to see someone and talk
to them,

48
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:53,126
feelings that I have too.

49
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:57,197
Could this possibly be what
it feels like to be lonely?

50
00:04:57,197 --> 00:04:59,933
‐ [Fakir Voiceover] <i>What</i>
<i>it feels like to be lonely?</i>

51
00:04:59,933 --> 00:05:01,434
<i>Mytho is regaining his heart.</i>

52
00:05:01,434 --> 00:05:03,069
Look at this face!

53
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:05,705
I hate this face and its
feelings.

54
00:05:05,705 --> 00:05:09,109
This wretched face
wallowing in its loneliness.

55
00:05:09,109 --> 00:05:11,411
Is it fun recalling such
emotions?

56
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:13,346
Does it feel good, Mytho?

57
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:14,915
‐ [Mytho] No.

58
00:05:14,915 --> 00:05:17,918
‐ Right, you have no
need of a heart, Mytho.

59
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:19,653
None whatsoever.

60
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:21,354
If you were to regain such
a thing‐‐

61
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:23,223
‐ If I were?

62
00:05:23,223 --> 00:05:25,826
‐ Don't fall for such
a fool's hope, got that?

63
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:27,994
‐ Yes.
‐ Speak louder!

64
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:30,630
‐ Understood, I will do as you
say, Fakir.

65
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,766
‐ [Fakir] Good, as it should be.

66
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:37,971
‐ [Mr. Cat] Miss Duck,
as punishment for disturbing

67
00:05:37,971 --> 00:05:40,173
the advanced class, you will
practice the develope,

68
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:42,609
am I understood?
‐ [Duck] Yes, sir.

69
00:05:42,609 --> 00:05:44,377
‐ [Mr. Cat] If you practice
earnestly I'll put you

70
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:45,445
back with the beginners.

71
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:46,446
‐ [Duck] Oh, yes sir!

72
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:48,148
‐ Practice poorly though,

73
00:05:48,148 --> 00:05:49,950
and I'll have you marry me
forthwith!

74
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:51,051
(Duck screeches in terror)

75
00:05:54,421 --> 00:05:57,624
‐ I'm a bird on probation,
plus I have to stay late.

76
00:05:57,624 --> 00:06:00,827
At this rate I may never
get to be like Rue!

77
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:03,430
Oh, it's Mytho!

78
00:06:04,598 --> 00:06:06,099
(sighing)

79
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:09,536
‐ Princess Tutu?

80
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:11,605
‐ That's just a story!

81
00:06:11,605 --> 00:06:15,141
She's still a princess fated
never to be with her prince.

82
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:17,444
When she confesses her
love, she turns into a speck

83
00:06:17,444 --> 00:06:19,145
of light and vanishes.

84
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:21,982
‐ That's just what happens
to Tutu in the story.

85
00:06:21,982 --> 00:06:24,751
The story isn't reality.

86
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:26,653
Though it is true that
Mytho is a prince from

87
00:06:26,653 --> 00:06:28,555
inside a story.

88
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:30,123
Oh, who cares?

89
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:32,392
It doesn't matter if the
story is real or not.

90
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,294
All I wanna do is find the
pieces of Mytho's heart

91
00:06:34,294 --> 00:06:36,363
and give them back to him.

92
00:06:36,363 --> 00:06:39,099
<i>That's right, I'm not</i>
<i>thinking about being with him</i>

93
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:41,034
<i>or confessing to him</i>
<i>or anything.</i>

94
00:06:41,034 --> 00:06:43,236
I'm not thinking about
any of that!

95
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:46,406
(soft classical music)

96
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:49,676
Oh!

97
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:01,621
‐ [Mytho] I don't really
understand.

98
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:05,158
‐ It's okay, you can be a dummy,
Mytho.

99
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:07,060
Now and forever.

100
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,562
Trust me, Mytho, you do love me.

101
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:13,066
‐ Oh, okay, then I do love you.

102
00:07:13,066 --> 00:07:15,268
‐ Yes, yes, remember that.

103
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,203
You don't need to understand,

104
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:19,539
and you don't need a heart
either.

105
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:21,341
What?

106
00:07:21,341 --> 00:07:24,377
‐ This feeling of wanting
to see someone and talk to them,

107
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:26,913
it stays even when I'm with you.

108
00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:31,384
Could this possibly be
the feeling of loneliness?

109
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:33,887
I don't know, these emotions
I'm feeling‐‐

110
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,722
‐ Rue!

111
00:07:35,722 --> 00:07:39,426
Would you please stop making
him recall stupid things?

112
00:07:39,426 --> 00:07:41,361
Mytho, go back to your room.

113
00:07:41,361 --> 00:07:43,863
‐ [Mytho] Okay.

114
00:07:43,863 --> 00:07:45,665
‐ You'd better not be the
person who's helping him

115
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:47,500
dredge up these weird things.

116
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,035
‐ Oh please!

117
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:51,738
‐ Who else are you saying
could have done it?

118
00:07:51,738 --> 00:07:55,075
‐ Maybe it was Princess Tutu
from the fairy tale.

119
00:07:55,075 --> 00:07:56,609
Maybe she appeared in real life.

120
00:07:56,609 --> 00:07:58,078
‐ Quiet!

121
00:07:58,078 --> 00:08:00,947
Try to stay away from Mytho
from now on.

122
00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:03,683
‐ Stop trying to order me
around!

123
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:10,223
‐ [Blonde Girl] Huh, Piano?

124
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:12,058
‐ Where's Duck?

125
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:13,526
‐ Ah!

126
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:19,165
‐ [Both] Is that Duck?

127
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:21,434
‐ Oh, why are you two here?

128
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:23,269
‐ Hey hey, that's our line.

129
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:24,938
‐ That's right, we came
here thinking you would be

130
00:08:24,938 --> 00:08:28,341
really depressed because
you had to stay behind.

131
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,110
‐ Why are you so chipper?

132
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:31,978
‐ Thank you both,
but I'm really having

133
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:34,881
a lot of fun right now,
because the more you practice

134
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:37,350
dancing the more fun it becomes!

135
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:40,120
‐ Oh Duck!
(Duck screams)

136
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,789
Don't force it,
you can exhale when you're sad

137
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:45,792
or like you're in pain
when you're suffering.

138
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:48,194
Oh, you were suffering then!

139
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:49,863
‐ Well it was your fault!

140
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:50,897
‐ No.

141
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:51,931
‐ Are you okay?

142
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:54,200
‐ Yeah, I'm okay.

143
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,536
‐ Say, why don't
we keep her company?

144
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,104
‐ Yeah, good idea!

145
00:08:58,104 --> 00:09:00,273
‐ What? Thank you!

146
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:02,976
‐ It's fine, after all,
this is for you!

147
00:09:02,976 --> 00:09:06,646
Okay, let's all drop the
probationary class with Duck.

148
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:09,983
(soft classical music)

149
00:09:09,983 --> 00:09:13,086
You still have a long way to go,
Duck.

150
00:09:16,256 --> 00:09:18,825
‐ [Mr. Cat] Miss Duck!
(girls gasp)

151
00:09:18,825 --> 00:09:19,859
‐ Mr. Cat!

152
00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:22,195
‐ I have some unfortunate news.

153
00:09:22,195 --> 00:09:24,197
(growls)

154
00:09:28,168 --> 00:09:30,036
‐ Uh, unfortunate news?

155
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:33,673
‐ Yes, Miss Duck, you
have worked much too hard.

156
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:38,178
Therefore unfortunately, I must
put off having you marry me!

157
00:09:38,178 --> 00:09:41,514
‐ Uh, oh, I see then!

158
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:46,252
‐ And, I will let you return
to the beginner class.

159
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:48,254
‐ What? Oh!

160
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:50,457
Oh thank you so much!

161
00:09:50,457 --> 00:09:52,392
‐ You did it,
I'm so happy for you!

162
00:09:52,392 --> 00:09:54,294
Good job, all right Duck!

163
00:09:54,294 --> 00:09:56,963
(wind whistling)

164
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,503
‐ The wind's picking up.

165
00:10:03,503 --> 00:10:05,338
Oh, Mytho!

166
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:11,578
‐ [Mytho] What is it
you want me to do?

167
00:10:11,578 --> 00:10:13,580
‐ Who are you talking to?

168
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:19,486
(Duck gasps)

169
00:10:21,821 --> 00:10:23,656
What, what was?

170
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:26,025
Uh, Mytho?

171
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:28,128
Huh, where?

172
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:29,829
Mytho!

173
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:31,598
He's gone!

174
00:10:31,598 --> 00:10:33,600
Mytho ahh!

175
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,301
‐ What are you doing?

176
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,270
‐ I'm sorry.

177
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:41,141
Huh, he's not there!

178
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:43,343
‐ Were you just calling
for Mytho?

179
00:10:43,343 --> 00:10:45,879
‐ Uh, yeah.
‐ You need something?

180
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:49,349
‐ No, not need but, I just
saw him come out this way.

181
00:10:49,349 --> 00:10:50,350
‐ What?

182
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:52,085
There was no one coming out.

183
00:10:52,085 --> 00:10:54,587
‐ Bu, but I'm sure I saw Mytho!

184
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:57,223
‐ No way, I didn't see anyone
out here.

185
00:10:57,223 --> 00:10:59,225
‐ So, that way then?

186
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:00,226
‐ It was you!

187
00:11:00,226 --> 00:11:01,628
‐ [Duck] Huh, what?

188
00:11:01,628 --> 00:11:03,530
‐ You cried out rudely when I
was dancing

189
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:04,531
and interrupted me!

190
00:11:04,531 --> 00:11:06,199
‐ [Duck] Oh, well that was‐‐

191
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:08,334
‐ You don't seem to have
the slightest comprehension

192
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:11,137
as to how much focus is
required when dancing!

193
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:13,339
‐ Oh, if it's about that, sorry!

194
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:16,209
But more importantly, Mytho
was acting weird just now.

195
00:11:16,209 --> 00:11:17,944
Or rather, acting strange.

196
00:11:17,944 --> 00:11:20,914
That's the same, but anyway,
I gotta find him now.

197
00:11:20,914 --> 00:11:22,382
See ya!

198
00:11:22,382 --> 00:11:25,084
‐ Hold on, we aren't done
talking yet!

199
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:26,553
Wait just a minute!

200
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:30,623
(Nutcracker theme)

201
00:11:37,497 --> 00:11:38,965
(Nutcracker theme)

202
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:45,104
‐ Mytho, you need to stay away
from Rue!

203
00:11:45,104 --> 00:11:46,005
Mytho?

204
00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:55,081
‐ [Duck Voiceover] <i>It's</i>
<i>strange, definitely strange.</i>

205
00:11:55,081 --> 00:11:57,283
<i>After talking to someone</i>
<i>invisible it's like</i>

206
00:11:57,283 --> 00:11:59,652
<i>time skipped forward and Mytho,</i>

207
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:01,888
I wonder which way he went?

208
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:05,491
Uh, Rue?

209
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:09,596
‐ Your, your name,
it's Duck right?

210
00:12:09,596 --> 00:12:11,798
You run pretty, pretty fast!

211
00:12:11,798 --> 00:12:13,566
‐ Oh, yeah, I know!

212
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,001
‐ Don't mock me!

213
00:12:15,001 --> 00:12:17,837
I'm just a little out of breath,
okay?

214
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:19,839
So just cut it out!

215
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,942
‐ Okay, sor‐‐
(groans)

216
00:12:30,617 --> 00:12:32,652
Um‐‐
‐ What is it?

217
00:12:32,652 --> 00:12:34,587
‐ Since there are two of us
here,

218
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:35,989
I was thinking maybe
it would be faster

219
00:12:35,989 --> 00:12:38,691
if we split up and searched
separately.

220
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:41,294
‐ That, that's true,
you're quite right.

221
00:12:41,294 --> 00:12:43,329
It's rather odd that
someone like you and I

222
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:45,898
should be walking shoulder
to shoulder to begin with.

223
00:12:45,898 --> 00:12:46,899
‐ Odd?

224
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:48,101
<i>Yeah, she's right.</i>

225
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:50,703
Oh, well I'll go look over here.

226
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:53,873
We can decide on a time or
something and meet up somewhere.

227
00:12:53,873 --> 00:12:55,375
‐ I changed my mind.
‐ What?

228
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:57,243
Why is that?

229
00:12:57,243 --> 00:13:00,079
‐ It's much more reliable with
two pairs of eyes looking.

230
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:01,714
‐ Hmm, ya think?

231
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:04,217
(quirky music)

232
00:13:08,054 --> 00:13:10,056
Um‐‐
‐ [Rue] What is it now?

233
00:13:10,056 --> 00:13:11,991
‐ [Duck] Have you been friends
with Mytho

234
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:13,626
for a long time now?

235
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:15,094
‐ [Rue] You keep calling him
Mytho,

236
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:16,796
that's awfully forward of you!

237
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:19,098
‐ But Mytho told me that
I could.

238
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:21,434
‐ And another thing,
we're not exactly friends,

239
00:13:21,434 --> 00:13:24,037
so I'd appreciate it if
you didn't call me Rue.

240
00:13:24,037 --> 00:13:26,406
‐ Then what am I supposed to
call you?

241
00:13:26,406 --> 00:13:27,440
‐ Lady Rue.

242
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,010
‐ Hmm, Lady...

243
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,412
Rue?

244
00:13:32,412 --> 00:13:34,280
‐ What, what's so hard about
that?

245
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,849
‐ [Duck] It's just
weird, I'll call you Rue,

246
00:13:36,849 --> 00:13:37,984
it's cuter that way.

247
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:39,752
‐ Cuter?

248
00:13:39,752 --> 00:13:42,655
‐ Besides, we've walked together
and talked all this time,

249
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,691
so we're already friends now.

250
00:13:44,691 --> 00:13:46,159
Thus, it's Rue.

251
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:48,227
Still no Mytho, huh Rue?

252
00:13:48,227 --> 00:13:49,329
‐ [Rue] Hmmph!

253
00:13:59,472 --> 00:14:02,408
‐ Oh!

254
00:14:02,408 --> 00:14:03,810
What's that?

255
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:06,646
(ghostly sobbing)

256
00:14:06,646 --> 00:14:08,614
They're all, all crying!

257
00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:12,118
‐ It's a funeral, so naturally!

258
00:14:12,118 --> 00:14:13,353
‐ [Both] Mytho!

259
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:18,024
‐ (panting) Huh?

260
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:20,159
‐ What?
‐ What's this?

261
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:22,095
(thunder booming)
A dead end?

262
00:14:28,835 --> 00:14:30,103
(bright music)

263
00:14:30,103 --> 00:14:31,771
What can this be now?

264
00:14:35,308 --> 00:14:36,676
‐ [Duck] Miss Edel!

265
00:14:36,676 --> 00:14:39,011
‐ Good evening Duck, good
evening Rue.

266
00:14:39,011 --> 00:14:40,947
‐ How is it that you know my‐‐

267
00:14:40,947 --> 00:14:44,951
‐ Oh, she knows everything,
even the fact that I'm a bir‐‐

268
00:14:44,951 --> 00:14:45,952
Oh.

269
00:14:45,952 --> 00:14:47,320
‐ Say what?

270
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,455
‐ Anyway, she's nobody
suspicious.

271
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:50,823
‐ She is too!

272
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:52,859
‐ Miss Edel,
we were looking for Mytho,

273
00:14:52,859 --> 00:14:54,794
and we saw him here,
but something really weird

274
00:14:54,794 --> 00:14:56,529
happened just now.

275
00:14:56,529 --> 00:14:59,365
He walked into that dead end
with a funeral procession

276
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:00,700
and vanished!

277
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,502
‐ A story in a story.

278
00:15:02,502 --> 00:15:04,303
‐ Huh, a story?

279
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:07,673
‐ There once was a beautiful
maiden with a beautiful heart,

280
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:09,942
and maidens fall in love.

281
00:15:09,942 --> 00:15:12,645
‐ Your story has nothing
to do with finding Mytho!

282
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:14,347
‐ [Miss Edel] But unlike her
beloved,

283
00:15:14,347 --> 00:15:16,883
this maiden was not noble born.

284
00:15:16,883 --> 00:15:19,185
It was a love never to be
requited.

285
00:15:19,185 --> 00:15:21,287
‐ I just said‐‐
‐ Wait, Rue!

286
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:24,023
So what happened to the maiden,
Miss Edel?

287
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:26,659
‐ Devastated,
she took her own life.

288
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:28,594
‐ Oh!

289
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:31,264
‐ If her love wouldn't be
requited in this world,

290
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:34,233
she'd be reborn and see it
fulfilled then.

291
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:37,336
However, her fiancÃ© never came,

292
00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:38,838
and the maiden took another man

293
00:15:38,838 --> 00:15:41,441
to the world of the dead
in his stead.

294
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:45,044
This is the maiden's melancholy
story within the story.

295
00:15:45,044 --> 00:15:47,013
Here in this town,
there was a maiden

296
00:15:47,013 --> 00:15:49,148
who met the exact same fate.

297
00:15:49,148 --> 00:15:51,551
As in the story,
she fell in love.

298
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:54,353
And just as in the story,
she lost hope.

299
00:15:54,353 --> 00:15:58,391
And just as in the story, she
took her own life, and then‐‐

300
00:15:58,391 --> 00:16:00,960
‐ Is the story going to become
real?

301
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,430
‐ [Miss Edel] The story will
become real in this town,

302
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:07,400
where reality and stories
intermingle.

303
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,402
(bells tolling)

304
00:16:09,402 --> 00:16:11,404
(somber music)

305
00:16:11,404 --> 00:16:13,573
‐ Just as in the story,
Mytho will be taken

306
00:16:13,573 --> 00:16:15,274
in that man's stead.

307
00:16:15,274 --> 00:16:16,542
‐ I won't let that happen!

308
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:17,910
‐ [Miss Edel] It's starting.

309
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,078
‐ [Girls] Huh?

310
00:16:23,883 --> 00:16:26,219
‐ [Duck] The dead end!
‐ [Rue] A mansion?

311
00:16:26,219 --> 00:16:27,920
‐ [Miss Edel] The maiden's
soul has settled in

312
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,355
that mansion's courtyard.

313
00:16:29,355 --> 00:16:30,756
She has been waiting.

314
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:31,891
‐ Let's go, Rue!

315
00:16:31,891 --> 00:16:32,959
‐ Yes!

316
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,443
‐ [Duck] Mytho!
‐ I'm that man?

317
00:16:50,443 --> 00:16:54,447
If you say it is true,
then perhaps I am.

318
00:16:54,447 --> 00:16:57,049
‐ Mytho, who are you talking to?

319
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:01,220
(female giggling)

320
00:17:03,456 --> 00:17:04,724
What's going on?

321
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,099
(soft music)

322
00:17:13,165 --> 00:17:16,502
(rock crunching)

323
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:19,205
(chimes ringing)

324
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:24,310
‐ Is she the maiden then?

325
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:25,845
(chime ringing)

326
00:17:25,845 --> 00:17:26,913
The pendant!

327
00:17:26,913 --> 00:17:30,650
(suspenseful classical music)

328
00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:39,258
‐ So it was you that was
calling to me all of this time.

329
00:17:48,301 --> 00:17:50,469
‐ The rosemary from Giselle?

330
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:52,505
You mustn't take it!
‐ [Duck] No, Rue!

331
00:17:52,505 --> 00:17:55,675
‐ You'll be taken away
to the world of the dead!

332
00:17:55,675 --> 00:17:56,842
Come over here!

333
00:18:02,148 --> 00:18:03,616
‐ Oh, Rue!

334
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:25,371
(gasping in effort)

335
00:18:34,714 --> 00:18:39,218
(gasping in effort)

336
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:41,053
‐ [Rue Voiceover] I don't
have the stamina to dance

337
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:45,157
Giselle to the end, if only I
had done more basic training.

338
00:18:46,425 --> 00:18:49,595
(gasps in defeat)

339
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:52,098
‐ Rue!

340
00:18:52,098 --> 00:18:53,833
(female giggling)

341
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:54,767
‐ No, don't!

342
00:18:56,068 --> 00:18:57,803
‐ Oh no!

343
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:00,473
‐ Well well, at this rate
the prince will be entering

344
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:02,575
an eternal slumber.

345
00:19:02,575 --> 00:19:04,844
Is that okay, Princess Tutu?

346
00:19:04,844 --> 00:19:07,413
(laughter)

347
00:19:07,413 --> 00:19:10,049
(chimes ringing)

348
00:19:23,796 --> 00:19:27,533
‐ [Duck] My prince, stop,
you mustn't take it!

349
00:19:34,407 --> 00:19:36,308
‐ Why, why do you interfere?

350
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:37,610
Who are you?

351
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:39,645
‐ I am Princess Tutu.

352
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:41,947
Just like you,
I am fated never to be

353
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:43,949
with the one whom I love.

354
00:19:45,251 --> 00:19:47,753
Please, come and dance with me.

355
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:53,693
(lively classical music)

356
00:20:17,983 --> 00:20:20,986
‐ Amazing, she's still
keeping up with her!

357
00:20:20,986 --> 00:20:23,489
‐ If you share
the same fate as I,

358
00:20:23,489 --> 00:20:26,692
then why is your dancing
not laden with sorrow?

359
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:29,628
‐ Because of the many
other emotions in my heart

360
00:20:29,628 --> 00:20:31,731
that won't give in
to the sorrow.

361
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:34,366
Even if you take Mytho,

362
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:37,303
it won't dispel the sorrow,
will it?

363
00:20:37,303 --> 00:20:39,572
Because the sorrow that resides
within you

364
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:41,674
is not how you truly feel.

365
00:20:45,311 --> 00:20:49,148
I cannot know how much, nor
how long you have suffered.

366
00:20:49,148 --> 00:20:51,150
But I know
whatever your story is,

367
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:53,753
you have grieved enough
in your heart,

368
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:56,789
and so you can sleep
in peace now.

369
00:20:56,789 --> 00:20:59,892
Yes, you needn't grieve anymore.

370
00:20:59,892 --> 00:21:01,961
(sighing)

371
00:21:05,498 --> 00:21:07,600
(sighing)

372
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:15,407
(soft classical music)

373
00:21:22,081 --> 00:21:24,717
This is the shard
of your heart called sorrow,

374
00:21:24,717 --> 00:21:28,053
and it makes people suffer.

375
00:21:28,053 --> 00:21:31,190
But it still is an
important emotion to have.

376
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:33,793
(chime ringing)

377
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:42,067
‐ Princess Tutu!

378
00:21:48,741 --> 00:21:50,676
‐ The emotions returning
to the prince

379
00:21:50,676 --> 00:21:52,511
are loneliness and sorrow,

380
00:21:52,511 --> 00:21:55,047
feelings people have
no desire for.

381
00:21:55,047 --> 00:21:58,050
My dear princess,
do you think this will

382
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:02,054
bring your prince happiness?
(laughs)

383
00:22:05,724 --> 00:22:08,093
(soft music)

384
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:21,106
(soft singing in Japanese)

385
00:23:35,848 --> 00:23:37,082
‐ [Duck] Mytho, he's a prince,

386
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:38,384
is this the real you, Mytho?

387
00:23:38,384 --> 00:23:39,985
‐ [Mytho] Will you be going
today, Duck?

388
00:23:39,985 --> 00:23:42,154
‐ [Rue] I was a fool for
believing what Duck said.

389
00:23:42,154 --> 00:23:43,522
‐ [Fakir] When you were
wandering,

390
00:23:43,522 --> 00:23:45,024
completely stripped
of your memories,

391
00:23:45,024 --> 00:23:46,592
I was the one who gave
you the name of Mytho.

392
00:23:46,592 --> 00:23:47,593
‐ [Ghost] My only wish is
to keep on

393
00:23:47,593 --> 00:23:49,295
shining for someone.

394
00:23:49,295 --> 00:23:52,998
Somewhere along the way I
had simply become forgotten.

395
00:23:52,998 --> 00:23:54,867
‐ [Duck] It's sad that
they no longer need you,

396
00:23:54,867 --> 00:23:57,503
but it's something
that can't be helped.

397
00:23:57,503 --> 00:24:00,272
‐ [Drosselmeyer] All who
love stories gather round.

398
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:02,541
(laughter)
