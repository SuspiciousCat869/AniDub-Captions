1
00:00:02,569 --> 00:00:06,974
‐ [Narrator] Once upon a time,
there was a man who died.

2
00:00:06,974 --> 00:00:09,343
The story was interrupted.

3
00:00:09,343 --> 00:00:11,778
Along with his heart,
the prince lost

4
00:00:11,778 --> 00:00:14,014
his kindness towards
other people,

5
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:18,252
and even him memories of
having fought bravely.

6
00:00:19,186 --> 00:00:23,357
Meanwhile, scattered
throughout the town,

7
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:27,027
the shards of the prince's
heart sought places to settle,

8
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:29,897
and found their way
into people's hearts,

9
00:00:29,897 --> 00:00:31,732
which had a void in them.

10
00:00:31,732 --> 00:00:34,134
Among those possessed
by the shards

11
00:00:34,134 --> 00:00:38,705
were some that ended up making
their own tales go awry.

12
00:00:41,008 --> 00:00:43,877
(gentle piano music)

13
00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:32,185
‐ [Duck] I really and
truly have been able

14
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:34,388
to become Princess Tutu.

15
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:38,825
‐ Tuck your chin in!

16
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,360
(laughing)

17
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,262
It's no laughing matter!

18
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:43,497
If you can't even do that,

19
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:45,332
then you'll never
get off probation!

20
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:46,400
‐ Stop it!

21
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,135
Now be reasonable!

22
00:02:48,135 --> 00:02:51,271
Duck simply isn't capable
of doing two things at once!

23
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:53,440
‐ All she has to do is walk
with a book on her head!

24
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,408
‐ But something so simple,

25
00:02:54,408 --> 00:02:56,109
she can't do it,
she simply can't!

26
00:02:56,109 --> 00:02:57,811
‐ Then she'll never
be a prima ballerina!

27
00:02:57,811 --> 00:03:00,681
‐ No she won't, she couldn't
possibly become one.

28
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:02,749
Stop saying such awful things!

29
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:06,319
Oh, look how hurt she is.
(whimpering)

30
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,387
Come on, smile.

31
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:08,689
‐ Hey, it's your fault.

32
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:09,623
‐ No way.

33
00:03:09,623 --> 00:03:10,891
‐ But for someone on probation,

34
00:03:10,891 --> 00:03:12,325
Duck sure has been acting weird,

35
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:14,027
and goofy smiley all day.

36
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,562
‐ She's always been weird.

37
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:17,230
‐ I mean more than usual.

38
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,331
‐ Now that you say it.

39
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:19,466
‐ What?

40
00:03:19,466 --> 00:03:22,202
‐ [Both] Did
something happen, huh?

41
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:23,470
‐ [Duck] No, not really.

42
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,671
‐ [Both] Liar!

43
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:26,306
‐ [Duck] Not that there
was anything, but.

44
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:27,507
‐ [Both] So there was!

45
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:28,809
‐ [Duck] Uh, well.

46
00:03:28,809 --> 00:03:32,179
‐ [Both] Come on
Duck, spit it out!

47
00:03:32,179 --> 00:03:34,281
‐ Um, so yeah, this dream,

48
00:03:34,281 --> 00:03:36,216
it's about this one
dream that I had.

49
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:39,352
See, there's this really strong
and handsome prince in it.

50
00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:42,122
And this prince is fighting
against and evil raven.

51
00:03:42,122 --> 00:03:45,525
He conceals the raven away
as he shatters his own heart.

52
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:48,829
But when he loses his heart,
he also loses his feelings.

53
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:52,432
And the prince's eyes
always look so lonely.

54
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:53,600
‐ Is that all?

55
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,203
Hey, I've heard a
story like that before.

56
00:03:56,203 --> 00:03:57,404
‐ Story?

57
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:59,473
‐ It's from the
Prince and the Raven.

58
00:03:59,473 --> 00:04:00,407
‐ Huh?

59
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:03,643
‐ Here, this book, right?

60
00:04:03,643 --> 00:04:07,347
‐ The prince was a hero who
fought the demonic raven.

61
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:09,683
Well, he was when they were
still inside the story.

62
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:11,418
‐ [Duck] And, what's
the name of the guy

63
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:12,619
who wrote the story?

64
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:14,020
‐ His name?

65
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,889
It's Drosselmeyer,
don't you know?

66
00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:18,091
‐ No, I had no idea!

67
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:20,794
‐ This is no time for silly
books and stupid grins.

68
00:04:20,794 --> 00:04:23,096
‐ Two books are too
much for you, Duck.

69
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:25,899
‐ Make sure you can do
it by the end of the day!

70
00:04:25,899 --> 00:04:28,201
‐ Good luck, you've
got nothing to lose!

71
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:29,536
‐ And don't you dare slack off!

72
00:04:29,536 --> 00:04:32,706
‐ Oh, so this
Drosselmeyer person,

73
00:04:32,706 --> 00:04:35,208
does he lives
somewhere in this town?

74
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:36,109
‐ Huh?

75
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:38,178
No way, he died ages ago.

76
00:04:38,178 --> 00:04:39,446
‐ What?

77
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:42,449
‐ The story ends part
of the way through, too.

78
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:44,284
‐ Oh yeah, didn't he like,

79
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:46,653
die while he was writing
the book or something?

80
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:47,954
‐ What?

81
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:49,723
‐ Yes, he came out
of the story I wrote

82
00:04:49,723 --> 00:04:53,794
and ended up losing his
heart to seal the raven away.

83
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:56,930
‐ That means the person
writing the story died

84
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:59,633
and the characters in
the story came out?

85
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:01,535
Something that strange.

86
00:05:01,535 --> 00:05:03,370
But I guess it isn't as strange

87
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:06,373
as a duck turning into a person.

88
00:05:06,373 --> 00:05:08,475
So that would mean
that senior Mytho

89
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:11,111
is actually a prince
out of a story.

90
00:05:11,111 --> 00:05:14,447
That must be why he's
so handsome then.

91
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:16,950
It's Rue.

92
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:20,420
I wonder if she
knows about this.

93
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,455
Oh, it's senior Mytho!

94
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:26,359
So, he's going on
a picnic with Rue.

95
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:27,694
Lucky her.

96
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:30,130
But you know, when you
get right down to it,

97
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:32,265
I'm just a duck.

98
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:34,267
Maybe I'll practice
or something.

99
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:35,068
‐ Hey!

100
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:35,969
(gasps)

101
00:05:35,969 --> 00:05:37,470
Have you seen Mytho around?

102
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:39,306
‐ Is something the
matter with senior Mytho?

103
00:05:39,306 --> 00:05:42,642
‐ He went out, without
even telling me about it.

104
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:44,311
‐ Gee, who cares about that?

105
00:05:44,311 --> 00:05:46,313
He's Rue's boyfriend, after all.

106
00:05:46,313 --> 00:05:47,347
‐ (gasps) What?

107
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:48,381
So he's with Rue?

108
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:50,650
Were did they go?

109
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:51,451
Tell me!

110
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:52,352
‐ I don't know!

111
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:53,620
‐ Don't lie to me!

112
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,188
‐ It's the truth!

113
00:05:57,657 --> 00:06:01,027
Oh, I wonder if he knows
about senior Mytho.

114
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:03,396
Say, do you happen
to know the story

115
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:05,398
of the Prince and the Raven?

116
00:06:05,398 --> 00:06:06,566
‐ What about it?

117
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:09,669
‐ [Duck] Oh, um,
nothing really about it.

118
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:13,039
‐ A tale for children
and nothing more.

119
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:19,346
‐ Hm, acting so high and mighty.

120
00:06:19,346 --> 00:06:22,349
He doesn't even have a clue.

121
00:06:22,349 --> 00:06:25,518
So senior Mytho is a
prince from inside a story,

122
00:06:25,518 --> 00:06:28,255
and I'm the only one
who knows about it.

123
00:06:28,255 --> 00:06:31,524
It's up to me to
protect my prince.

124
00:06:31,524 --> 00:06:33,093
(bells chiming)

125
00:06:33,093 --> 00:06:35,929
I'm not playing hooky,
I'm just taking a break.

126
00:06:35,929 --> 00:06:37,264
I'm allowed to do that.

127
00:06:37,264 --> 00:06:38,999
Besides, if I see
senior Mytho and Rue,

128
00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:42,202
I can tell them that nasty
guy was looking for them.

129
00:06:42,202 --> 00:06:45,138
I wonder if it's
okay to tell them.

130
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:47,207
‐ [Edel] Truth is
a shy little thing.

131
00:06:47,207 --> 00:06:49,242
If you approach, it will hide.

132
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:50,410
‐ Miss Edel?

133
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,145
‐ Truth is a lonesome
little thing.

134
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:55,181
If you run away,
it will give chase.

135
00:06:56,216 --> 00:06:58,585
Having doubts, are you?

136
00:06:58,585 --> 00:06:59,920
‐ Well, um, I am.

137
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:02,522
So you see, there's this person,

138
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:03,757
and then there's another person

139
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:05,025
who's really good
friends with that person,

140
00:07:05,025 --> 00:07:06,693
and that person also
has another good friend,

141
00:07:06,693 --> 00:07:08,628
but that person's friends
aren't exactly friends

142
00:07:08,628 --> 00:07:09,629
with one another.

143
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:11,598
Do you understand what
I'm trying to say?

144
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:15,335
‐ A mighty wind can fan
flames and make treetops sway,

145
00:07:15,335 --> 00:07:17,570
but flames burn
trees to the ground.

146
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:20,907
‐ So, wind and flames
and trees, huh?

147
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:22,609
Does that mean
that they can never

148
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:23,610
get along with each other?

149
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:24,778
‐ Who's to say?

150
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:25,712
‐ Huh.

151
00:07:25,712 --> 00:07:27,781
But if the wind was too strong,

152
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:30,550
it would put out the fire
and topple all the trees.

153
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:33,453
So that means, I don't get it.

154
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,855
Well, thanks anyway Miss Edel!

155
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:52,372
Hm, if it's a picnic,
maybe they're at this park.

156
00:07:52,372 --> 00:07:53,974
Hey, there they are!

157
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:56,209
‐ Mytho.

158
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:57,477
‐ [Mytho] What?

159
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,479
‐ I want to hear you
say that you love me.

160
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:00,580
(yelps)

161
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,549
‐ Oh, what should I do?

162
00:08:02,549 --> 00:08:03,450
Should I go back?

163
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:04,484
I should go back, shouldn't I?

164
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:05,518
I'm going back now.

165
00:08:05,518 --> 00:08:07,253
‐ Yes Rue, I love you.

166
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:08,688
‐ [Rue] Really?

167
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:10,890
‐ [Mytho] I really love you.

168
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:14,928
‐ I'm feeling thirsty.

169
00:08:14,928 --> 00:08:18,932
(classical piano music)

170
00:08:18,932 --> 00:08:19,733
‐ Huh?

171
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:25,505
‐ I think I would like
to drink some water.

172
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,374
Get it for me?

173
00:08:27,374 --> 00:08:28,208
‐ Yes.

174
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:32,278
‐ (whimpering) He's
coming this way.

175
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:33,079
What do I do?

176
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:34,514
He might see me!

177
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:39,786
Man, they really are
perfect for each other.

178
00:08:39,786 --> 00:08:41,888
But they didn't look
like they were having

179
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:43,690
very much fun out there.

180
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:46,860
If he said something
like that to me.

181
00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:49,262
Like that.

182
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:50,363
‐ Hello, Duck.

183
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,332
(Duck giggles)

184
00:08:52,332 --> 00:08:54,334
You know I love you, don't you?

185
00:08:54,334 --> 00:08:56,603
(Duck giggles)

186
00:08:56,603 --> 00:08:57,537
I really do.

187
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:00,874
(Duck giggles)

188
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:01,708
‐ Ow!

189
00:09:02,976 --> 00:09:03,810
Excuse.

190
00:09:06,012 --> 00:09:08,014
Oh, senior Mytho.

191
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:09,382
Hello!

192
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,151
Um, the weather's
pretty nice today, huh?

193
00:09:11,151 --> 00:09:12,485
So it may be bright
during the day

194
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:14,687
but I'm sure it'll
be dark at night.

195
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:16,723
Stupid me, what am I
stating the obvious for,

196
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:18,224
I gotta say something funny!

197
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:19,559
Uh, you know what?

198
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:22,328
I really love taking walks,
and you really love Rue, right?

199
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:25,498
Oh man, what the
heck am I saying?

200
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:26,866
‐ [Mytho] Probably.

201
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:28,168
‐ Probably?

202
00:09:28,168 --> 00:09:29,803
‐ I guess I don't really
understand what love is.

203
00:09:29,803 --> 00:09:31,704
But Rue and Fakir
are the only ones

204
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:34,541
who will tell me
what to do, so I...

205
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:36,676
‐ You don't understand love?

206
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:37,777
Senior Mytho?

207
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:40,680
‐ Mytho's fine.

208
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,682
‐ (screaming) Oh, senior Mytho!

209
00:09:42,682 --> 00:09:44,751
I mean Mytho, your hand!

210
00:09:46,453 --> 00:09:48,254
Does it hurt?

211
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:49,189
‐ No.

212
00:09:49,189 --> 00:09:50,723
So then why the weird face?

213
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:53,226
‐ Is it really a weird face?

214
00:09:53,226 --> 00:09:56,262
(whimpers) But
you're hurt, Mytho!

215
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:59,766
‐ Fakir and Rue don't
say things like that.

216
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,702
‐ It's the prince's eyes.

217
00:10:02,702 --> 00:10:05,105
The poor prince
who lost his heart.

218
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:07,674
That's why he doesn't
know his own feelings,

219
00:10:07,674 --> 00:10:09,709
not even about
loving or hurting.

220
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:11,811
Then I'll do my best!

221
00:10:13,246 --> 00:10:14,414
‐ At what?

222
00:10:14,414 --> 00:10:16,349
‐ Um, that is,
nothing in particular,

223
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:19,285
but rather, I wanna work super
hard at all sorts of things!

224
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,154
Right, that injury!

225
00:10:21,154 --> 00:10:23,490
It'll get worse if you
don't wash it properly.

226
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:26,759
Thank goodness it's
nothing too bad.

227
00:10:28,328 --> 00:10:31,397
(screams) The water
that you went and got.

228
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:36,269
I'm sorry, I'm really sorry,
I'll go get some more.

229
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:39,739
That being said, river
water just wouldn't cut it.

230
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:42,408
Rue deserves good‐tasting
water, after all.

231
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:45,979
Water from these houses
wouldn't work either, right?

232
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:48,448
Where should I get it from?

233
00:10:48,448 --> 00:10:49,949
Oh, am I not in town?

234
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:52,752
Guess I must have
walked too far.

235
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:54,087
Oh, Mytho!

236
00:10:54,087 --> 00:10:55,688
I'll just go get the water,
so you just stay here

237
00:10:55,688 --> 00:10:57,223
and I'll be right back!

238
00:10:57,223 --> 00:10:59,392
Wait, I mean, where
can I find water?

239
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:01,494
‐ Oh, right there.

240
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,796
‐ Oh, that's a restaurant!

241
00:11:03,796 --> 00:11:07,066
Some restaurant water
would be perfect, huh?

242
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:07,901
‐ Maybe.

243
00:11:09,469 --> 00:11:12,972
‐ Open, Ebine.

244
00:11:12,972 --> 00:11:15,542
I wonder if that's
the restaurant's name.

245
00:11:16,743 --> 00:11:17,577
(knocking)

246
00:11:17,577 --> 00:11:18,611
Excuse me!

247
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:19,445
‐ Yes?

248
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:22,649
‐ Uh, this is a
restaurant, right?

249
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:24,951
‐ Yes, yes it is!

250
00:11:24,951 --> 00:11:26,286
(screaming)

251
00:11:26,286 --> 00:11:27,854
One moment, please!

252
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:30,790
(crashing)

253
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,158
Thank you for waiting.

254
00:11:32,158 --> 00:11:33,459
Welcome!

255
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:35,562
I am the owner and
chef here at Ebine!

256
00:11:35,562 --> 00:11:37,730
How did you find out
about this place?

257
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:38,731
Did a friend tell you?

258
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:40,033
‐ [Duck] No.

259
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:41,834
‐ Then did you go out
of your way to find it?

260
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:42,769
‐ No, not at all.

261
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:45,171
‐ It wasn't pure
chance now, huh?

262
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:45,972
‐ Oh, yeah.

263
00:11:45,972 --> 00:11:47,774
‐ How very splendid!

264
00:11:47,774 --> 00:11:50,510
I've never had a customer
like that before.

265
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:52,178
Now please, sit down.

266
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:54,447
‐ Ma'am, I'm not a customer.

267
00:11:54,981 --> 00:11:56,482
‐ Not a customer?

268
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:58,051
‐ I came for water.

269
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:00,620
‐ Just for some water?

270
00:12:01,321 --> 00:12:03,823
‐ That is, I'm so sorry!

271
00:12:05,358 --> 00:12:06,726
‐ You're hungry, aren't you?

272
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:09,729
Then why not have a nice
meal while you're here?

273
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:10,496
‐ What?

274
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:11,764
I don't have any money!

275
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:13,933
‐ That's fine, it
doesn't matter!

276
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:16,869
Oh yes, I just made
some shrimp pate.

277
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:19,572
‐ The pendant glowed just now.

278
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:22,442
Does that mean she has one
of the shards with her?

279
00:12:22,442 --> 00:12:27,180
(Nutcracker Theme music)

280
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:44,564
‐ Where did Mytho go?

281
00:12:44,564 --> 00:12:45,832
‐ I don't know.

282
00:12:45,832 --> 00:12:48,434
‐ Don't ever take him
out without telling me.

283
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:50,803
‐ Mytho doesn't belong to you.

284
00:12:50,803 --> 00:12:51,938
‐ Nor to you.

285
00:12:53,906 --> 00:12:56,609
Mytho made mention of a feeling.

286
00:12:58,077 --> 00:12:59,045
‐ What's that?

287
00:12:59,045 --> 00:13:00,880
‐ Where is Mytho?

288
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,883
‐ He went for some water,
and hasn't come back yet.

289
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:05,218
‐ By himself?

290
00:13:05,218 --> 00:13:07,787
‐ Who else would
he be going with?

291
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:09,822
This isn't like you at all.

292
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:12,258
What are you so frantic about?

293
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:14,994
Wait!

294
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:16,663
It you're going
to look for Mytho,

295
00:13:16,663 --> 00:13:18,498
then I'm coming with you.

296
00:13:18,498 --> 00:13:19,365
‐ Now!

297
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:20,967
Please help yourselves to it!

298
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:22,769
‐ Ma'am, if you could get us‐

299
00:13:22,769 --> 00:13:24,103
‐ Some more?

300
00:13:24,103 --> 00:13:25,905
You're right, this
is hardly enough!

301
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:27,140
‐ Wait, that's not it!

302
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,275
I have to check and see whether

303
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:31,377
she has a heart chart or not.

304
00:13:31,377 --> 00:13:32,445
Hm?

305
00:13:32,445 --> 00:13:33,413
It's cold.

306
00:13:33,413 --> 00:13:35,214
So's this, and this and this!

307
00:13:35,214 --> 00:13:36,783
Why are they all cold?

308
00:13:36,783 --> 00:13:39,085
There's not much
taste to them either.

309
00:13:39,085 --> 00:13:41,554
But they look so good.

310
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:43,022
‐ Rainbow trout!

311
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:45,892
‐ This one looks warm.

312
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:47,994
Cold!

313
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:49,295
‐ And now, rabbit cream stew,

314
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:50,997
piping hot dumpling salad,

315
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:52,632
grilled pork shanks.

316
00:13:53,466 --> 00:13:57,170
‐ (whimpers) They're cold, why?

317
00:13:57,170 --> 00:14:00,273
Hey, don't you think
something's strange here?

318
00:14:00,273 --> 00:14:01,574
‐ Like?

319
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:04,010
‐ Like, all the dishes
she brings out are cold.

320
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:06,446
Or why she's
feeding us for free!

321
00:14:06,446 --> 00:14:07,447
‐ Who knows?

322
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:10,550
‐ I see.

323
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:12,919
Mytho can't even tell
when something's strange.

324
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:14,053
‐ Here's dessert!

325
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:14,987
(whimpering)

326
00:14:14,987 --> 00:14:16,489
And that concludes course A.

327
00:14:16,489 --> 00:14:18,224
Next up, course B!

328
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:19,192
‐ What?

329
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,728
Okay, listen.

330
00:14:21,728 --> 00:14:24,030
I'm going to the restroom.

331
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:24,764
‐ Sure.

332
00:14:27,834 --> 00:14:30,036
‐ All right, I better
hurry up and check.

333
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:32,372
‐ (laughing) Yes, that's right.

334
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:35,842
It's been so long since
we had a customer.

335
00:14:35,842 --> 00:14:39,879
They're eating so much, but
I have to have them eat more!

336
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:43,316
Who will taste
better, you or you?

337
00:14:43,316 --> 00:14:45,351
‐ Who will taste better?

338
00:14:47,153 --> 00:14:51,758
(whimpering) Grave.

339
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:54,694
What should I do?

340
00:14:54,694 --> 00:14:56,129
At this rate I'll be...

341
00:14:56,129 --> 00:14:58,097
(dinging)

342
00:14:58,097 --> 00:14:59,899
I don't care what happens to me!

343
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,602
But Mytho, I gotta save him!

344
00:15:02,602 --> 00:15:05,037
I know a story that
goes like this.

345
00:15:05,037 --> 00:15:07,340
A brother and sister
lost in the forest

346
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,808
find a gingerbread house.

347
00:15:08,808 --> 00:15:10,643
Then a kind old woman appears

348
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:12,412
and serves them
all sorts of food.

349
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:13,646
But she was really planning

350
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:16,249
to fatten up the two
and eat them afterwards.

351
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:17,884
‐ Really.

352
00:15:17,884 --> 00:15:21,120
‐ It's no good, Mytho doesn't
understand he's in danger.

353
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,256
We gotta get out!

354
00:15:28,461 --> 00:15:29,729
Recipes?

355
00:15:29,729 --> 00:15:31,063
And a photograph?

356
00:15:31,063 --> 00:15:32,532
What are these?

357
00:15:32,532 --> 00:15:33,800
‐ What are you doing?

358
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,969
‐ Oh, well, I was
thinking of going soon.

359
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:39,939
‐ No, you can't!

360
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:42,008
I've still got my
dishes to cook!

361
00:15:42,008 --> 00:15:43,109
‐ Your dishes?

362
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:44,710
‐ More must be eaten!

363
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:45,878
Much more!

364
00:15:45,878 --> 00:15:47,447
‐ Eating more for what?

365
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:49,649
‐ You'll stay 'til you're done!

366
00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:52,618
‐ Why should I stay
when I'm already full?

367
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:55,588
‐ I see.

368
00:15:56,389 --> 00:15:58,324
Well then, how about you?

369
00:15:58,324 --> 00:16:00,059
You'll eat more, right?

370
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:00,960
‐ Probably.

371
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,663
(screaming)

372
00:16:03,663 --> 00:16:04,597
(knocking)

373
00:16:04,597 --> 00:16:06,165
‐ Open up, please open up!

374
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:08,935
‐ [Ebine] If you won't
eat, you can go home!

375
00:16:08,935 --> 00:16:09,735
‐ Locked.

376
00:16:09,735 --> 00:16:10,870
Oh Mytho!

377
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:13,072
‐ Come now, it's going awry.

378
00:16:13,072 --> 00:16:15,041
The story's going awry.

379
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:17,109
Heart shards make their homes

380
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:18,978
in the holes in people's hearts,

381
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,113
and convolute their stories.

382
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:23,583
It seems a heart
that is too pure

383
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:25,418
is an awfully heavy burden.

384
00:16:25,418 --> 00:16:27,220
Now, do tell me,

385
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:31,624
how will you handle this
story, Princess Tutu?

386
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:37,330
(magical classical music)

387
00:16:46,239 --> 00:16:48,274
‐ That little
nuisance is gone now.

388
00:16:48,274 --> 00:16:50,810
You just keep eating.

389
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:52,211
Who could that be?

390
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:54,780
Who's there?

391
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:02,655
‐ Meal time has now ended.

392
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:09,228
Please, my prince,
you must rest a while.

393
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:12,265
‐ My customer!

394
00:17:12,265 --> 00:17:15,101
Give me back my customer!

395
00:17:15,101 --> 00:17:18,337
‐ Please come dance
with me, Miss Ebine.

396
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:20,506
‐ I am not a dancer.

397
00:17:20,506 --> 00:17:22,608
My job is not to dance.

398
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:27,046
My job is to cook, and have
my customers eat my cooking.

399
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:30,149
‐ What do you hope to gain
by forcing him to eat?

400
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:32,652
‐ I want him to keep
eating more and more!

401
00:17:32,652 --> 00:17:34,153
‐ Yes, but why?

402
00:17:34,153 --> 00:17:35,388
‐ What do you mean, why?

403
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:37,557
I want him to eat lots and lots!

404
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:40,092
I want my dear customer
to have his fill.

405
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:43,563
Because having your fill of
every kind of delicious food

406
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:45,231
is pure happiness.

407
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:46,465
‐ I found you.

408
00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:49,535
This person's heart is
not where you belong.

409
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:51,203
Let's go back.

410
00:17:51,203 --> 00:17:53,072
‐ I'm not letting
him go anywhere!

411
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:53,873
Stay away!

412
00:17:53,873 --> 00:17:55,575
‐ Miss Ebine!

413
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:57,910
What feeling is that shard?

414
00:18:03,049 --> 00:18:05,284
‐ I just want him
to enjoy my cooking!

415
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:08,187
That's what a restaurant is for!

416
00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:12,425
‐ Then why has your cooking
become so bland and cold?

417
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:14,894
(gasps)

418
00:18:14,894 --> 00:18:17,163
Why would you force your
customer to eat such a meal?

419
00:18:17,163 --> 00:18:19,265
Why would you lock him up?

420
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:21,767
I want you to tell me

421
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:25,404
what it is you're
feeling, Miss Ebine.

422
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:27,440
‐ What I'm feeling.

423
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,209
‐ Come dance with
me, Miss Ebine.

424
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:35,948
‐ Yes.

425
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:39,218
Back then, I felt a little
uncertainty, but mostly bliss.

426
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:41,187
I could have burst
with happiness.

427
00:18:41,187 --> 00:18:43,923
The warm atmosphere,
happy conversations,

428
00:18:43,923 --> 00:18:45,257
delicious food.

429
00:18:45,257 --> 00:18:47,259
‐ [Tutu] What a
wonderful restaurant.

430
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:49,128
A wonderful couple.

431
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:52,264
‐ I'd set my dish next
to his and point, saying,

432
00:18:52,264 --> 00:18:54,734
who will taste
better, you or you.

433
00:18:54,734 --> 00:18:56,636
He'd tease me and point at mine.

434
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:58,604
You still have a long way to go.

435
00:18:58,604 --> 00:19:01,273
But that was happiness for me.

436
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:04,410
Who will taste
better, you or you?

437
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:06,278
‐ [Tutu] That's what
those words meant.

438
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:10,149
‐ There's no one left to
tease me when I ask about it.

439
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:13,185
I have recipes, but the
person who cooked them

440
00:19:13,185 --> 00:19:14,920
is no longer here.

441
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,656
I'm so lonely.

442
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:20,559
So I wanted to have my customers
stay as long as possible.

443
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,895
I could at least have that.

444
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:29,869
‐ You're the feeling of
loneliness, aren't you?

445
00:19:29,869 --> 00:19:31,470
‐ The feeling of loneliness.

446
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:34,940
‐ Yes, but this is
not where you belong.

447
00:19:39,078 --> 00:19:41,247
‐ I'm sorry, but I must go.

448
00:19:41,247 --> 00:19:42,314
‐ Wait, don't go!

449
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:44,316
Please, I'll be alone again.

450
00:19:44,316 --> 00:19:48,721
‐ Don't worry, you won't
be left alone, Miss Ebine.

451
00:19:48,721 --> 00:19:50,690
Because you have the
recipes left behind

452
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:53,325
by the one you love, right here.

453
00:19:55,895 --> 00:19:59,298
Lots of dishes are waiting,
wanting to be made.

454
00:19:59,298 --> 00:20:02,635
A gift left to you by
the one who loved you.

455
00:20:02,635 --> 00:20:06,372
The power to turn
loneliness into strength.

456
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:12,878
(weeping)

457
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:13,713
‐ My dear.

458
00:20:15,281 --> 00:20:18,918
I feel like I can cook
warm dishes again.

459
00:20:18,918 --> 00:20:21,253
Warm, just like your heart.

460
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:25,224
I'll make this a wonderful
restaurant again.

461
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,626
Please help me, my dear.

462
00:20:35,668 --> 00:20:37,036
‐ My prince.

463
00:20:37,036 --> 00:20:39,705
Your feelings belong
inside of you.

464
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:42,742
Your life belongs
within your heart.

465
00:20:46,545 --> 00:20:49,882
‐ I'd like to thank
you, Princess Tutu.

466
00:21:03,829 --> 00:21:05,064
‐ Oh Mytho.

467
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:08,033
(sighs)

468
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:09,368
All right.

469
00:21:09,368 --> 00:21:12,071
‐ Mytho, what are
you doing here?

470
00:21:12,071 --> 00:21:12,872
Hey!

471
00:21:12,872 --> 00:21:14,306
‐ Well, nothing.

472
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,376
‐ So what happened, Mytho?

473
00:21:17,376 --> 00:21:18,911
‐ Princess Tutu.

474
00:21:19,979 --> 00:21:22,281
‐ [Duck] Don't tell
me he knows it's me!

475
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,150
‐ She appeared and touched me.

476
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:26,352
‐ Princess Tutu?

477
00:21:26,352 --> 00:21:28,754
‐ This is ridiculous,
that's just a story.

478
00:21:28,754 --> 00:21:31,757
‐ Huh? Tutu is part
of the story, too?

479
00:21:31,757 --> 00:21:33,993
But I'm a duck!

480
00:21:33,993 --> 00:21:38,030
‐ Though blessed with beauty,
cleverness and strength,

481
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:42,701
she's still a princess faded
never to be with her prince.

482
00:21:42,701 --> 00:21:44,603
When she confesses her love,

483
00:21:44,603 --> 00:21:47,306
she turns into a speck
of light and vanishes.

484
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:48,274
(screaming)

485
00:21:48,274 --> 00:21:49,441
‐ What's part of the story?

486
00:21:49,441 --> 00:21:50,576
What's real?

487
00:21:50,576 --> 00:21:52,545
Tutu is me and I'm a duck,

488
00:21:52,545 --> 00:21:54,947
but Tutu is, Tutu is...

489
00:21:54,947 --> 00:21:55,815
‐ [Narrator] That's right,

490
00:21:55,815 --> 00:21:58,450
Princess Tutu is
a tragic princess.

491
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:02,354
Stories aren't always
guaranteed a happily ever after.

492
00:22:02,354 --> 00:22:04,323
(cackles)

493
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:07,827
(gentle music)

494
00:23:34,813 --> 00:23:37,216
‐ [Duck] All I wanna do is find
the pieces of Mytho's heart

495
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:38,417
and give them back to him!

496
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:40,119
I'm not thinking
about being with him

497
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:41,553
or confessing to
him or anything.

498
00:23:41,553 --> 00:23:43,722
‐ [Mytho] I don't know,
these emotions I'm feeling.

499
00:23:43,722 --> 00:23:45,524
‐ [Fakir] You'd better
not be the one helping him

500
00:23:45,524 --> 00:23:46,725
dredge up these weird things.

501
00:23:46,725 --> 00:23:49,295
‐ [Rue] Maybe it was Princess
Tutu from the fairy tale.

502
00:23:49,295 --> 00:23:50,729
‐ [Narrator] The story
will become real,

503
00:23:50,729 --> 00:23:53,966
in this town where reality
and stories intermingle.

504
00:23:53,966 --> 00:23:55,267
‐ I am Princess Tutu.

505
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:57,436
Just like you, I am
fated never to be

506
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:59,104
with the one whom I love.

507
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:04,276
‐ All who love stories,
gather 'round. (cackling)
