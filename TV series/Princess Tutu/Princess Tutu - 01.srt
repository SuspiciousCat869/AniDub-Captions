00:00:02,903 --> 00:00:07,808
‐ [Narrator] Once upon a time
there was a man who died.

2
00:00:07,808 --> 00:00:12,412
The man's work was the writing
and telling of stories.

3
00:00:12,412 --> 00:00:15,549
But he could not defy death.

4
00:00:15,549 --> 00:00:18,018
The last story he was
working on was about a

5
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:22,189
brave and handsome prince who
vanquishes a crafty raven.

6
00:00:23,557 --> 00:00:27,261
But now, it seems their battle
will go on for eternity.

7
00:00:28,629 --> 00:00:31,498
I'm sick and tired of
this, cried the raven.

8
00:00:31,498 --> 00:00:36,370
I'm sick and tired of this,
cried the prince as well.

9
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:39,206
The raven escaped from
the pages of the story,

10
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:43,143
and the prince pursued
the fell creature.

11
00:00:43,143 --> 00:00:47,014
In the end, the prince
took out his own heart,

12
00:00:47,014 --> 00:00:51,218
and sealed the raven away
by using a forbidden power.

13
00:00:52,452 --> 00:00:55,622
Just then, a murmur
came from somewhere.

14
00:00:55,622 --> 00:00:57,424
This is great, said the old man

15
00:00:57,424 --> 00:00:59,927
who was supposed to have died.

16
00:01:01,194 --> 00:01:04,464
(soft classical music)

17
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:20,647
(soft singing in Japanese)

18
00:02:49,536 --> 00:02:52,205

19
00:02:56,109 --> 00:02:58,845

(soft classical ballet music)

23
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:20,967
‐ [Duck Voiceover] I want, I
want to dance with him too.

24
00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:22,269
With the prince.

25
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:32,045
But I'm a duck, in voice
and looks, just a duck!

26
00:03:33,513 --> 00:03:37,684
I can't dance with him, I
can't even hold his hand.

27
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:43,724
And the prince's eyes
always look so lonely.

28
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:45,292
Won't you laugh?

29
00:03:45,292 --> 00:03:48,995
Please show me your
smile, my prince!

30
00:03:48,995 --> 00:03:49,830
Quack?

you care for him don't you?

Huh?

38
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:23,997
Whoa!

even just once!

Please excuse me I'm
leaving right away!

drawing me in!

I'm sorry I'm so sorry
I'm bothering you,

scatterbrain and I'm just so

bad at things, like everything,
and then on top of that

104
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:31,778
I'm always too hasty,
like Pike and Lillie say I

105
00:08:31,778 --> 00:08:33,446
talk like a Duck so I'm weird,

106
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:35,248
I mean, don't you
think I'm weird?

107
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:36,850
Shoot, even I think I'm weird.

108
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:37,884
‐ I don't.

109
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:39,652
‐ Huh, you don't
think I'm weird?

110
00:08:39,652 --> 00:08:40,854
‐ I don't.

111
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:41,688
‐ Ah!

112
00:08:43,056 --> 00:08:46,259
I can't believe it, no
one's ever said that to me.

113
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:48,928
(door creaking)

115
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:52,899
‐ Fakir.

116
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:54,367
‐ Senior Fakir!

117
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:57,437
‐ Did I not tell you to
inform me when you go out?

118
00:08:57,437 --> 00:08:58,538
‐ [Mytho] Yes.

119
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,206
‐ [Fakir] We're going, stand up.

120
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,207
What's wrong?

121
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,442
‐ My foot.

122
00:09:02,442 --> 00:09:03,543
‐ [Fakir] Foot,
did you twist it?

123
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:04,644
‐ [Mytho] Hmm.

124
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:05,779

126
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:07,480
What?

127
00:09:09,082 --> 00:09:13,119
Um, um, it was my fault, he
saved me when I tripped and‐‐

128
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:15,555
‐ What were you thinking
doing such a pointless thing?

129
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,524
‐ [Duck] So like I said,
he was protecting me!

130
00:09:17,524 --> 00:09:19,859
‐ That's why I said pointless!

131
00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:21,494
Stand up, we're going back.

132
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:23,730
‐ [Duck] You don't have
to be so rough with him!

133
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:24,631
‐ [Fakir] Quiet!

134
00:09:24,631 --> 00:09:25,865
‐ Pointless, huh?

135
00:09:25,865 --> 00:09:27,934
Well sure, maybe, but
you don't have to say it

136
00:09:27,934 --> 00:09:30,003
quite so bluntly you know!

137
00:09:30,003 --> 00:09:31,604
(bells tolling)

138
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:33,840
Huh, the bell again?

139
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,308
What?

140
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:36,576
‐ [Girls] What?

141
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,011
‐ Right but if you'd
just taken the time

142
00:09:38,011 --> 00:09:39,245
to look at the clock!

143
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:40,513
‐ I was panicked, okay?

144
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:42,649
‐ And that's what
makes you so cute!

145
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:45,685
Always be our clumsy
scatterbrained Duck!

146

honor of talking with Fakir,

so it's okay!

149
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:51,925
‐ What'd you say?

150
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:53,159
You know Fakir's the best!

151
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:55,095
‐ No the best is Senior Mytho!

152
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:58,798
‐ Oh Duck, the wonderful
Mytho has already got Rue!

153
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:02,435
‐ [Both] A doomed love, a
Duck destined for heartbreak.

154
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:03,336
‐ How cute!

155
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:06,005
(ominous music)

156
00:10:11,744 --> 00:10:12,979
‐ The teacher's here!

157
00:10:12,979 --> 00:10:13,813
‐ Yes!

158
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:15,615
Cat?

159
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,585
‐ That's Mr. Cat!

160
00:10:18,585 --> 00:10:19,886
‐ [Duck] Mr. Cat?

161
00:10:19,886 --> 00:10:21,588
‐ Is something wrong?

162
00:10:21,588 --> 00:10:23,323
‐ [Duck] A cat for a teacher?

163
00:10:23,323 --> 00:10:25,859
‐ All right, quiet
down, if you don't,

164
00:10:25,859 --> 00:10:29,028
rest assured I will
have you marry me!

165
00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:32,866
(wedding march off key music)

166
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:39,506
Start in first
position, now releve,

167
00:10:39,506 --> 00:10:41,741
and move your arms
to second position.

168
00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:44,944
Remember, straight legs,
and now third position,

169
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:47,080
arms are low, that's it!

170
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,682
Don't stick your bottoms out!

171
00:10:49,682 --> 00:10:52,552
(chimes tinkling)

172
00:10:54,287 --> 00:10:56,956
‐ [Duck Voiceover] Senior Mytho!

173
00:10:56,956 --> 00:10:59,626
Why did his eyes look so lonely?

174
00:11:02,362 --> 00:11:03,663
Uh!
‐ Bottom!

175
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,031
‐ Sir!

176
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:07,267
‐ Your mind was somewhere
else, wasn't it?

177
00:11:07,267 --> 00:11:09,102
If you do not focus then,

178
00:11:09,102 --> 00:11:11,404
I will have you marry me!

179
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:13,239
(wedding march music)
‐ Yes sir!

180
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:14,073
I'm sorry!

181
00:11:17,911 --> 00:11:20,146
‐ All right, we will now
observe a performance

182
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:21,915
by the special class.

183
00:11:21,915 --> 00:11:25,451
Members of the special
class are to enter!

184
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:29,222
(harp music)

185
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:32,158
‐ [Girls] Wow!

186
00:11:33,126 --> 00:11:33,960
Rue!

187
00:11:39,332 --> 00:11:41,901
(gasps in awe)

188
00:11:43,303 --> 00:11:46,539
(elegant ballet music)

189
00:12:03,156 --> 00:12:04,457
‐ Wow so pretty!

190
00:12:04,457 --> 00:12:05,892
‐ Yes, unlike duck!

191
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:06,726
‐ Aw!

192
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:07,894
‐ Now she's depressed!

193
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:09,662
‐ Oh no, she really
got depressed?

194
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:11,364
Oh how cute!

195
00:12:11,364 --> 00:12:14,701
(dramatic ballet music)

196
00:12:19,973 --> 00:12:22,475
(sighs dejectedly)

197
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:25,245
‐ [Duck Voiceover] For
Senior Mytho it'd have to be

198
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:28,248
someone like Rue to
make a good match.

199
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:29,082
So sad.

200
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:33,453
What to do?

201
00:12:33,453 --> 00:12:34,821
‐ I won't indulge you anymore,

202
00:12:34,821 --> 00:12:36,656
this time I will
have you marry me!

203
00:12:36,656 --> 00:12:38,324
‐ I'm sorry, Duck
was just so moved she

204
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:39,792
couldn't help but cry out!

205
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:42,228
‐ She's taxing but cute,
so please forgive her!

206
00:12:42,228 --> 00:12:44,831
(ominous music)

207
00:12:44,831 --> 00:12:46,666
‐ [Duck Voiceover] I still
haven't made a proper

208
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:51,037
apology to Senior Mytho
for getting him hurt!

209
00:12:51,037 --> 00:12:53,273
I have to apologize.

210
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:56,175
(Nutcracker theme)

211
00:13:01,414 --> 00:13:04,350
(Nutcracker theme)

212
00:13:08,187 --> 00:13:10,223
‐ You should be grateful to us!

213
00:13:10,223 --> 00:13:11,724
‐ [Lillie] You were
this close to being

214
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:13,326
forced to marry Mr. Cat!

215
00:13:13,326 --> 00:13:14,794
‐ Thanks.

216
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:15,795
‐ [Pike] What's wrong
Duck, you're acting weird!

217
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,096
‐ Weird!

218
00:13:17,096 --> 00:13:19,899
‐ You think it's weird
to suddenly show up?

219
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:21,134
‐ Show up?

220
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:22,869
‐ Well, I say suddenly,
but if there's no choice

221
00:13:22,869 --> 00:13:24,937
but suddenly it's
not weird, right?

222
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:25,905
‐ Where's this?

223
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:27,006
‐ Even if it is weird!

224
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:28,041
‐ Not for you!

225
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:29,208
‐ I just gotta go!

226
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:30,176
‐ Gotta go where?

227
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:31,177
‐ Okay I'm going!

228
00:13:31,177 --> 00:13:32,612
‐ Let's go!

229
00:13:32,612 --> 00:13:33,646
‐ See ya later!

230
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,415
‐ Where are you going?

231
00:13:35,415 --> 00:13:36,249
‐ So cute!

232
00:13:42,622 --> 00:13:44,857
(groaning)

233
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:49,962
‐ [Duck Voiceover] I'm not
supposed to go into the

234
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:52,899
boys dormitory but I'm
just going to apologize so

235
00:13:52,899 --> 00:13:55,501
I have to apologize so,

236
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:58,938
and I can't apologize
unless I go inside!

237
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:02,842
(sighing)

238
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:05,745
Oh you stupid stupid
stupid coward!

239
00:14:06,646 --> 00:14:08,014
‐ [Fakir] You're in my way.

240
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:10,550
(Duck grunts in surprise)

241
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:12,318
‐ Oh, um, is Senior Mytho‐‐

242
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:13,886
‐ He's not here.

243
00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:15,822
‐ Yeah so where‐‐

244
00:14:15,822 --> 00:14:17,323
‐ [Fakir] Go home!

245
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:19,826
‐ [Duck] Ouch!

246
00:14:19,826 --> 00:14:21,327
How is his injury?

247
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:23,930
‐ [Fakir] It's not serious.

248
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:25,832
‐ I'd like to apologize!

249
00:14:25,832 --> 00:14:27,967
‐ [Fakir] There's no need.

250
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:33,406
‐ Are you like this to
everyone you talk to?

251
00:14:33,406 --> 00:14:37,577
(groans) Oh that guy
really ticks me off!

252
00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:43,850
‐ Mytho.

253
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:46,519
‐ Fakir.

254
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:48,688
‐ [Fakir] I told
you to stay in bed.

255
00:14:48,688 --> 00:14:50,223
‐ Sorry.

256
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:52,658
‐ Is your foot hurting?

257
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:54,160
‐ [Mytho] I don't know.

258
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,362
‐ (sighs) What a wretch you are.

259
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:59,132
You're far too slow
and utterly useless.

260
00:14:59,132 --> 00:15:00,933
As for helping others,
you would do best

261
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:03,202
to forget such notions.

262
00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:04,036
‐ Yes.

263
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:08,541
‐ [Fakir] All you need to do
is listen to what I tell you.

264
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:09,742
‐ [Mytho] Yes.

265
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:25,491
‐ Man, after all that I
didn't get to make my apology!

266
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:29,495
I suck, I wonder if
his injury is okay?

267
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:32,465
Those eyes that
always look so lonely,

268
00:15:32,465 --> 00:15:35,635
there's gotta be some kind
of reason for it, right?

269
00:15:35,635 --> 00:15:38,504
Not that I can do
anything about it but,

270
00:15:38,504 --> 00:15:41,908
but if there were only
some way I could help him!

271
00:15:41,908 --> 00:15:45,211
If I were able to do something.

272
00:15:45,211 --> 00:15:47,380
I'd give my life for that.

273
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:50,783
(evil laughter)

274
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,453
(clock ticking)

275
00:15:58,691 --> 00:15:59,525
Huh?

276
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:01,661
What's that?

277
00:16:06,032 --> 00:16:06,866
That man!

278
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:18,110
He's not here!

279
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:20,413
‐ [Drosselmeyer] Yes I am!

280
00:16:20,413 --> 00:16:22,148
‐ [Duck] I wonder who he was?

281
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:26,385
‐ You haven't forgotten
about me already, have you?

282
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:29,622
‐ It feels strange out here.

283
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:34,160
‐ (Laughs) Do you want to know?

284
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,762
Well, do you, honestly now?

285
00:16:36,762 --> 00:16:40,366
(laughter) Little Duck?

286
00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:43,302
(evil laughter)

287
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:45,705
(Duck gasps)

288
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:50,643
The water has begun to flow,
the tide has begun to pass.

289
00:16:50,643 --> 00:16:52,311
Now tell me a story.

290
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:01,821
‐ I'm going.

291
00:17:01,821 --> 00:17:03,155
On my way back I'll borrow some

292
00:17:03,155 --> 00:17:05,057
books for you from the library.

293
00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:08,628
Don't read any except
for the ones I bring.

294
00:17:08,628 --> 00:17:11,030
‐ [Mytho] Okay, thank you.

295
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:14,534
‐ Don't give me cause
to worry, you idiot.

296
00:17:21,307 --> 00:17:25,311
(children laughing and talking)

297
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:35,922
‐ [Duck] Okay.

298
00:17:35,922 --> 00:17:37,590
‐ So what's okay now?

299
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:39,692
‐ You're going to
do something, right?

300
00:17:39,692 --> 00:17:40,893
I wonder what!

301
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,161
‐ [Duck] Nothing really.

302
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:44,063
‐ Maybe sneaking in
to see Senior Mytho?

303
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,331
‐ Oh my!

304
00:17:45,331 --> 00:17:46,999
‐ And if things go well,
strike up a friendship?

305
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:48,668
Was I right?

306
00:17:48,668 --> 00:17:50,102
‐ I hadn't thought that far.

307
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:51,837
‐ Oh no, that's the
spirit, you have to go in!

308
00:17:51,837 --> 00:17:53,306
‐ Somehow we'll make
sure to find a way

309
00:17:53,306 --> 00:17:54,807
to cover you being late!

310
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:56,008
‐ Uh, okay.

311
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:59,579
‐ [Both] Bye, bye, bye,
bye, bye, bye, bye!

312
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:01,847
‐ I wonder if it'll work out.

313
00:18:01,847 --> 00:18:02,915
‐ Oh, it'll be fine.

314
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,183
‐ You think?

315
00:18:04,183 --> 00:18:06,586
‐ Because even if she
fails, I'll comfort her.

316
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:09,355
‐ I have to do it
for real this time!

317
00:18:09,355 --> 00:18:10,222
Oh?

318
00:18:10,222 --> 00:18:12,992
(birds chirping)

319
00:18:16,295 --> 00:18:19,765
Canary mom's kids
leave the nest today!

320
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:22,568
(canary chirping)

321
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:32,178
(Duck gasps)

322
00:18:33,913 --> 00:18:34,747
Huh?

323
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,719
Be careful!

324
00:18:39,719 --> 00:18:43,055
(dramatic ballet music)

325
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,961
(canary chirping)

326
00:18:57,069 --> 00:18:59,472
(Duck gasps)

327
00:19:06,112 --> 00:19:06,946
No!

328
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:13,386
Oh no!

329
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:16,889
‐ Oh dear, the prince
is going to die.

330
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:18,791
The hero meets his death.

331
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:21,027
What's going to
happen in this story?

332
00:19:21,027 --> 00:19:24,230
Please, you have to tell
me what happens next!

333
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:26,265
Is the young prince
going to make it?

334
00:19:26,265 --> 00:19:28,467
Who in the world is
going to save him?

335
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:29,568
‐ But who?

336
00:19:29,568 --> 00:19:31,237
‐ Yes, I wonder who?

337
00:19:32,438 --> 00:19:33,272
‐ I'll!

338
00:19:34,707 --> 00:19:36,442
‐ [Drosselmeyer] Do you
care for him, little Duck?

339
00:19:36,442 --> 00:19:37,943
‐ [Duck] What?

340
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:40,212
‐ Do you want to be of help
to the poor young prince?

341
00:19:40,212 --> 00:19:41,747
‐ [Duck] What?

342
00:19:41,747 --> 00:19:44,450
‐ Are you saying that you're
going to tell me this story?

343
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:45,418
‐ [Duck] What?

344
00:19:45,418 --> 00:19:47,186
‐ Very well!

345
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,522
‐ That's right, I
will save the prince!

346
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:51,891
‐ Now you remember who you are?

347
00:19:51,891 --> 00:19:54,493
‐ Yes I do, I am Princess Tutu!

348
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:58,264
(chimes ringing)

349
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:07,106
(dramatic ballet music)

350
00:20:17,983 --> 00:20:19,085
Flower waltz!

351
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:47,413
(canary chirping)

352
00:20:50,783 --> 00:20:53,619
(canary chirping)

353
00:20:54,787 --> 00:20:57,623
And to think I was able
to save you, Mytho.

354
00:20:57,623 --> 00:20:59,191
It's like a dream!

355
00:20:59,191 --> 00:21:01,694
‐ How do you know my name?

356
00:21:01,694 --> 00:21:03,429
And you, who are you?

357
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:04,764
‐ I am‐‐

358
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:07,366
‐ [Drosselmeyer] Who indeed?

359
00:21:07,366 --> 00:21:08,167
‐ I am uh.

360
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:11,303
‐ You remember now, little Duck?

361
00:21:11,303 --> 00:21:12,972
Yes, you are a Duck.

362
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:16,442
Just a bird called a Duck.

363
00:21:17,576 --> 00:21:18,410
‐ Quack!

364
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:27,353
(Duck sobbing)

365
00:21:32,091 --> 00:21:33,192
‐ [Duck] I...

366
00:21:39,198 --> 00:21:41,467
(quacking)

367
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:46,806
So I was a duck.

368
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:50,543
‐ [Drosselmeyer] Well well,
Princess Tutu has gone

369
00:21:50,543 --> 00:21:52,678
back to being a duck!

370
00:21:52,678 --> 00:21:56,115
The story has just
begun, what to do now?

371
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:59,785
(laughter)

372
00:22:02,054 --> 00:22:04,490
(soft music)

373
00:22:15,134 --> 00:22:18,704
(soft singing in Japanese)

374
00:23:31,977 --> 00:23:33,812
(quacking)

375
00:23:33,812 --> 00:23:36,815
‐ [Duck] I'm just a duck,
and I thought I was a girl!

376
00:23:36,815 --> 00:23:38,851
‐ [Anteater] Oh my,
if it isn't Miss Rue!

377
00:23:38,851 --> 00:23:40,853
Mytho is going to
accompany me now.

378
00:23:40,853 --> 00:23:41,887
‐ [Duck] Anteater?

379
00:23:41,887 --> 00:23:43,389
‐ [Rue] Would you dance with me?

380
00:23:43,389 --> 00:23:45,024
‐ [Duck] Ru, Ru, Rue, you know
I'm really terrible at this,

381
00:23:45,024 --> 00:23:46,959
so I don't think I'm gonna
be any good to you at all!

382
00:23:46,959 --> 00:23:48,994
‐ [Rue] Don't worry, just
follow my directions.

383
00:23:48,994 --> 00:23:51,263
‐ [Mytho] I have the feeling
of bitter disappointment,

384
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:52,731
shattered and forgotten!

385
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:54,733
‐ [Duck] I really and
truly have been able

386
00:23:54,733 --> 00:23:56,068
to become Princess Tutu!

387
00:23:56,068 --> 00:23:58,170
‐ [Drosselmeyer] All you
children love stories,

388
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:02,007
come, gather round! (laughing)
