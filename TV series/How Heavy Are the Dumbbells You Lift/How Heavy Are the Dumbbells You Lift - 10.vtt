[HIBIKI] This place always goes

I'm gonna find him

00:03:07.228 --> 00:03:08.646 position:50% align:center
[TACHIBANA] Well, at least
you know what you want

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.565 position:50% align:center

Oh, that reminds me.

What the hell's that
supposed to mean?

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:26.141 position:50% align:center
[AYAKA]
It means you eat too much.

00:04:26.224 --> 00:04:27.392 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI] What am I
supposed to do when

00:04:27.475 --> 00:04:30.061 position:50% align:center
all the winter foods
are out in front of me?

00:04:30.145 --> 00:04:32.439 position:50% align:center
Crap! This is all
because of winter!

00:04:32.522 --> 00:04:34.691 position:50% align:center
[AYAKA]
Nope. It's all you.

00:04:34.774 --> 00:04:38.862 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI] Ah... Yeah, I guess
my pooch is a little squishier.

00:04:38.945 --> 00:04:40.947 position:50% align:center
And that's not even
the worst of it.

00:04:41.031 --> 00:04:43.074 position:50% align:center
I've got mad arm dingleberry.

00:04:43.158 --> 00:04:45.827 position:50% align:center

not easy to lose.

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:47.495 position:50% align:center
I know, Ayaka!

00:04:47.579 --> 00:04:50.415 position:50% align:center
Feels like no matter how much
I lift, it won't go away!

00:04:50.498 --> 00:04:52.292 position:50% align:center
Maybe I could just buy
a long-sleeved dress

00:04:52.375 --> 00:04:53.543 position:50% align:center
for the party.

00:04:53.626 --> 00:04:54.836 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I guess.

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:55.712 position:50% align:center
[MACHIO]
That's enough!

00:04:55.795 --> 00:04:56.546 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:58.048 position:50% align:center
Put those weights down.

00:04:58.131 --> 00:05:01.009 position:50% align:center
You've already done an excellent
job training your biceps.

00:05:01.092 --> 00:05:02.886 position:50% align:center
For balance, you should
focus a little more

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:04.512 position:50% align:center
on building your triceps.

00:05:04.596 --> 00:05:06.639 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
This time with clothes on?

00:05:06.723 --> 00:05:08.224 position:50% align:center
No way!

00:05:08.308 --> 00:05:10.393 position:50% align:center
When you're trying to build that
classic, strong, sculpted arm,

00:05:10.477 --> 00:05:11.728 position:50% align:center
you gotta make sure
you're targeting

00:05:11.811 --> 00:05:13.396 position:50% align:center
those triceps on the reg!

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.273 position:50% align:center
A lot of people assume
biceps are the key

00:05:15.357 --> 00:05:17.650 position:50% align:center
to really shaping your
guns, but the triceps

00:05:17.734 --> 00:05:20.236 position:50% align:center
are actually bigger and
offer more room to build.

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:21.780 position:50% align:center
Yes, I'm convinced!

00:05:21.863 --> 00:05:23.948 position:50% align:center
Gimme all the triceps
exercises you know!

00:05:24.032 --> 00:05:26.493 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna spend the rest of
the day just working on those!

00:05:26.576 --> 00:05:28.745 position:50% align:center
[AYAKA] Are you <i>trying</i>
to injure yourself?

00:05:28.828 --> 00:05:30.080 position:50% align:center
That's overkill.

00:05:30.163 --> 00:05:33.291 position:50% align:center
But, uh, we could do one.

00:05:33.375 --> 00:05:35.669 position:50% align:center
I think Skull Crushers
would be perfect!

00:05:35.752 --> 00:05:37.504 position:50% align:center
Why would someone name it that?

00:05:37.587 --> 00:05:42.509 position:50% align:center
[MACHIO] ♪ Machio-oh's
Muscle Lesson of the day! ♪

00:05:42.592 --> 00:05:44.969 position:50% align:center
Today we're gonna learn
how to do Skull Crushers.

00:05:45.053 --> 00:05:46.638 position:50% align:center
You may have also heard
these referred to

00:05:46.721 --> 00:05:48.390 position:50% align:center
as Triceps Extensions.

00:05:48.473 --> 00:05:50.308 position:50% align:center
Grab the bar above
your shoulders.

00:05:50.392 --> 00:05:53.019 position:50% align:center
Wrap your thumb around your
fingers for a safe grip.

00:05:53.103 --> 00:05:56.106 position:50% align:center
Position the bar directly above
the center of your chest.

00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:58.274 position:50% align:center
Now bend at the elbows
so that it comes down

00:05:58.358 --> 00:06:01.403 position:50% align:center
just below the hairline.
Keep your triceps flexed and

00:06:01.486 --> 00:06:05.156 position:50% align:center
your elbows in place as you push
the bar back up to position.

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.367 position:50% align:center
Now you see why they're
called Skull Crushers.

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:10.036 position:50% align:center
Not moving your elbows is
essential to this movement.

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:11.121 position:50% align:center
See?

00:06:11.204 --> 00:06:12.330 position:50% align:center
When they're locked into place,

00:06:12.414 --> 00:06:14.541 position:50% align:center
the bar stops right
where it's supposed to.

00:06:14.624 --> 00:06:17.460 position:50% align:center
When your elbows are loose,
the bar moves in a semicircle.

00:06:17.544 --> 00:06:20.547 position:50% align:center
This reduces resistance
and could cause injury.

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:23.341 position:50% align:center
I recommend the EZ Bar
when doing these at the gym.

00:06:23.425 --> 00:06:25.885 position:50% align:center
It promotes a less supinated
and more natural grip--

00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:27.971 position:50% align:center
which automatically takes
weight off your wrists

00:06:28.054 --> 00:06:30.015 position:50% align:center
and releases pressure
from your elbows,

00:06:30.098 --> 00:06:32.100 position:50% align:center
making it easier
to keep them steady.

00:06:32.183 --> 00:06:33.852 position:50% align:center
And that's one less
thing to think about

00:06:33.935 --> 00:06:37.647 position:50% align:center
so you can focus on getting
the slim physique you crave.

00:06:37.731 --> 00:06:39.733 position:50% align:center
I guess that must be the EZ bar.

00:06:39.816 --> 00:06:41.985 position:50% align:center
I don't think I've used
this one before.

00:06:42.068 --> 00:06:44.279 position:50% align:center
You can use it for any arm
exercise when you need

00:06:44.362 --> 00:06:47.115 position:50% align:center
to take pressure off your wrists
and elbows. Try it with bicep

00:06:47.198 --> 00:06:49.826 position:50% align:center
curls or hook it to a cable
for triceps presses.

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:52.203 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI] It's a perfect way to
keep your joints protected!

00:06:52.287 --> 00:06:54.164 position:50% align:center
Oh, man. Phew!

00:06:54.247 --> 00:06:56.124 position:50% align:center
That was harder than I thought!

00:06:56.207 --> 00:06:58.251 position:50% align:center
I wanna try it!

00:06:58.335 --> 00:07:02.047 position:50% align:center
Let's see, reach, and
get a grip with my thumb

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:03.214 position:50% align:center
around my fingers.

00:07:03.298 --> 00:07:05.967 position:50% align:center
Just be careful.
It feels lighter at first.

00:07:11.556 --> 00:07:12.891 position:50% align:center
I guess that depends!

00:07:12.974 --> 00:07:15.393 position:50% align:center
Does the EZ bar hurt less
than the straight bar?

00:07:15.477 --> 00:07:17.395 position:50% align:center
[MACHIO] Nope. They're
both made of steel.

00:07:17.479 --> 00:07:20.357 position:50% align:center

My head is trying to murder me!

00:07:25.904 --> 00:07:27.947 position:50% align:center

She's right.

00:07:29.616 --> 00:07:31.326 position:50% align:center
I'm glad it's just a bump and

get whatever they want.

00:13:54.334 --> 00:13:55.669 position:50% align:center
This sucks.

00:13:55.752 --> 00:13:57.962 position:50% align:center
I was really hoping I'd be
able to use these tickets.

00:13:58.046 --> 00:14:00.507 position:50% align:center
You don't need a
boyfriend to visit Destinyland.

00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:02.842 position:50% align:center
You might have a friend
who'd like to go with you.

00:14:02.926 --> 00:14:04.135 position:50% align:center
[TACHIBANA]
Yeah, that would be great.

00:14:04.219 --> 00:14:05.512 position:50% align:center
I'd like to use them, too.

00:14:05.595 --> 00:14:07.764 position:50% align:center
But these tickets expire
at the end of the year.

00:14:07.847 --> 00:14:10.225 position:50% align:center
And I have so much crap
to do before then.

00:14:10.308 --> 00:14:12.644 position:50% align:center
I don't think there's any
way I'll be able to go.

00:14:12.727 --> 00:14:15.271 position:50% align:center
Winter break is coming up.
Why don't you try going then?

00:14:15.355 --> 00:14:16.856 position:50% align:center
I can't.

00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:19.025 position:50% align:center
That's the only time off I have
to prepare for the winter cons.

00:14:19.109 --> 00:14:20.360 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
The what?

00:14:20.443 --> 00:14:21.236 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI, AYAKA]
Which con?

00:14:21.319 --> 00:14:22.779 position:50% align:center
You didn't let me finish!

00:14:22.862 --> 00:14:24.656 position:50% align:center
I have to complete my winter
concept for my walk-in closet!

00:14:24.739 --> 00:14:25.740 position:50% align:center
I want it to look like an igloo!

00:14:25.824 --> 00:14:26.825 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI]
Ms. Tachibana?

00:14:26.908 --> 00:14:28.243 position:50% align:center
Could I buy those
tickets from you?

00:14:28.326 --> 00:14:30.495 position:50% align:center
I'd love to go, and might
have someone I could take.

00:14:30.578 --> 00:14:32.539 position:50% align:center
You can have them.
I can't go anyway.

00:14:32.622 --> 00:14:34.624 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Thank you so much!

00:14:34.708 --> 00:14:36.167 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
What have you done with Akemi?

00:14:36.251 --> 00:14:37.460 position:50% align:center
You're actually
gonna do something

00:14:37.544 --> 00:14:39.087 position:50% align:center
other than work out
over the break?

00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:40.964 position:50% align:center
Who are you taking?

00:14:42.048 --> 00:14:43.591 position:50% align:center
Do you have a crush on somebody?

00:14:43.675 --> 00:14:45.635 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
Girl, you better spill that tea!

00:14:45.719 --> 00:14:50.640 position:50% align:center
I don't know what he'd say,
but the person I wanna ask is

00:14:50.724 --> 00:14:52.392 position:50% align:center
Mister Machio.

00:14:52.475 --> 00:14:55.145 position:50% align:center
[GINA]
What?!

00:14:55.228 --> 00:14:58.273 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] Hey, the heart
wants what the heart wants.

00:14:58.356 --> 00:15:00.108 position:50% align:center
Who knows?
Maybe they're...

00:15:00.191 --> 00:15:02.027 position:50% align:center
..."swole-mates."

00:15:02.819 --> 00:15:05.238 position:50% align:center
[CROWD cheering]

00:15:05.321 --> 00:15:07.490 position:50% align:center
So this is Destinyland, huh?

00:15:07.574 --> 00:15:09.242 position:50% align:center
Can't believe I've
never been here.

00:15:09.325 --> 00:15:11.453 position:50% align:center
It is so beautiful and exciting.

00:15:11.536 --> 00:15:12.620 position:50% align:center
[TACHIBANA]
What am I thinking?

00:15:12.704 --> 00:15:15.373 position:50% align:center
I've got Midwinter
Comiket to prepare for!

00:15:15.457 --> 00:15:17.459 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI] There she is.
So far, she's alone.

00:15:17.542 --> 00:15:18.752 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
Wait, wait, wait!

00:15:18.835 --> 00:15:20.003 position:50% align:center
I forgot to mention Ayaka's
at a training camp

00:15:20.086 --> 00:15:22.630 position:50% align:center
with her family's gym!
Ah, crap. Don't 'at' me.

00:15:22.714 --> 00:15:23.757 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:27.093 position:50% align:center
Hey, Akemi! Sorry
I'm late! [laughing]

00:15:27.177 --> 00:15:28.261 position:50% align:center
Thanks for inviting me!

00:15:28.345 --> 00:15:29.137 position:50% align:center
Sure!

00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:30.305 position:50% align:center
Ready to do this?

00:15:30.388 --> 00:15:32.015 position:50% align:center
--Yeah!
--Great!

00:15:32.098 --> 00:15:34.809 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI] What?
He's got regular clothes on.

00:15:34.893 --> 00:15:36.478 position:50% align:center
And he's not threatening
to take them off!

00:15:36.561 --> 00:15:38.980 position:50% align:center
[TACHIBANA] He shouldn't be here
with her in the first place!

00:15:41.149 --> 00:15:42.650 position:50% align:center
Well, so far it looks
like all they're doing

00:15:42.734 --> 00:15:44.527 position:50% align:center
is walking around the park.

00:15:44.611 --> 00:15:47.906 position:50% align:center
All right. I did a little
research on Destinyland.

00:15:47.989 --> 00:15:50.283 position:50% align:center
The first park was
created here in Japan.

00:15:50.367 --> 00:15:53.328 position:50% align:center
The ones in Florida, California,
Hong Kong, Shanghai,

00:15:53.411 --> 00:15:55.997 position:50% align:center
and Paris were designed after
the success of the original.

00:15:56.081 --> 00:15:57.999 position:50% align:center
Shut the front door,
are you for real?

00:15:58.083 --> 00:15:59.876 position:50% align:center
It's a Japanese franchise?

00:15:59.959 --> 00:16:02.253 position:50% align:center
America borrowed
from our culture?

00:16:02.337 --> 00:16:03.421 position:50% align:center
This is Mockey!

00:16:03.505 --> 00:16:05.840 position:50% align:center
The official mascot
of every theme park!

00:16:05.924 --> 00:16:07.384 position:50% align:center
[TACHIBANA] I'm gonna assume
they didn't mean for him

00:16:07.467 --> 00:16:08.885 position:50% align:center
to look like Creepy
Uncle Tickles.

00:16:08.968 --> 00:16:10.470 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
Not okay!

00:16:10.553 --> 00:16:12.806 position:50% align:center
I didn't notice you were wearing
our school uniform until now.

00:16:12.889 --> 00:16:14.349 position:50% align:center
Don't you judge me!

00:16:14.432 --> 00:16:17.060 position:50% align:center
If you want to hide a tree,
you throw it in a forest, right?

00:16:17.143 --> 00:16:18.853 position:50% align:center
Since there's a special for
students who wear their

00:16:18.937 --> 00:16:21.606 position:50% align:center
uniforms to the park, there will
be several of you here, right?

00:16:21.690 --> 00:16:23.316 position:50% align:center
So if I wanna be a
successful stalker,

00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:24.693 position:50% align:center
then I need to blend
in with the crowd

00:16:24.776 --> 00:16:26.695 position:50% align:center
and that means looking
like a high-school student!

00:16:26.778 --> 00:16:28.697 position:50% align:center
Uh, except, you just look like

00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:30.824 position:50% align:center
a lost member of a
vintage 90's girl band.

00:16:30.907 --> 00:16:33.535 position:50% align:center
I've seen this look many times
in social media selfies

00:16:33.618 --> 00:16:34.577 position:50% align:center
and music videos.

00:16:34.661 --> 00:16:36.204 position:50% align:center
[MOCKEY]
I'd bite into that cheese.

00:16:36.287 --> 00:16:37.455 position:50% align:center
[TACHIBANA] Listen,
ya pervy grandpa rodent!

00:16:37.539 --> 00:16:38.707 position:50% align:center
I'm pretty sure you're
not allowed to speak

00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:39.708 position:50% align:center
and no one asked you!

00:16:39.791 --> 00:16:41.626 position:50% align:center
[MACHIO, AKEMI laughing]

00:16:46.756 --> 00:16:48.383 position:50% align:center
[laughing]

00:16:49.718 --> 00:16:51.553 position:50% align:center
[GINA]
That's definitely a date.

00:16:51.636 --> 00:16:54.097 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
Yup.

00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:55.015 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI]
Oh, wow.

00:16:55.098 --> 00:16:56.516 position:50% align:center
What?

00:16:56.599 --> 00:16:59.144 position:50% align:center
I just looked at the clock
and noticed what time it was.

00:16:59.227 --> 00:17:02.313 position:50% align:center
Oh, right. We should go if
you still want to do it.

00:17:02.397 --> 00:17:05.400 position:50% align:center
I do. I'm so ready.

00:17:05.483 --> 00:17:08.403 position:50% align:center
[MACHIO, AKEMI laughing]

00:17:08.486 --> 00:17:09.821 position:50% align:center
Uh!

00:17:13.199 --> 00:17:14.576 position:50% align:center
[GINA]
Oh, no! They're gone!

00:17:14.659 --> 00:17:16.286 position:50% align:center
He took her inside a dark tent!

00:17:16.369 --> 00:17:18.038 position:50% align:center
Are they about to bang it out?

00:17:18.121 --> 00:17:20.582 position:50% align:center
Never heard you use
that expression before.

00:17:20.665 --> 00:17:22.375 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
But wait, are they?

00:17:22.459 --> 00:17:24.836 position:50% align:center
No way! Akemi wouldn't do that!

00:17:24.919 --> 00:17:26.588 position:50% align:center
Especially not at
an amusement park?

00:17:26.671 --> 00:17:28.923 position:50% align:center
She's bougie as hell!

00:17:29.007 --> 00:17:30.383 position:50% align:center
Unless she got
hormone-jacked.

00:17:30.467 --> 00:17:32.594 position:50% align:center
But Mr. Machio would never
do that with a minor!

00:17:32.677 --> 00:17:34.179 position:50% align:center
I mean, we shouldn't
assume the worst...

00:17:34.262 --> 00:17:37.307 position:50% align:center
Hibiki! It's time
to peep on Tom!

00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:39.309 position:50% align:center
Gina, wait! That's not cool!

00:17:39.392 --> 00:17:41.269 position:50% align:center
This is the stuff
crazy is made of.

00:17:41.353 --> 00:17:42.937 position:50% align:center
[GINA]
Aw, you feel guilty, I know.

00:17:43.021 --> 00:17:44.439 position:50% align:center
But this too, shall pass.

00:17:44.522 --> 00:17:47.025 position:50% align:center
It's not guilt, it's a
conscience, you criminal!

00:17:47.108 --> 00:17:47.901 position:50% align:center
Uh, wha--?

00:17:47.984 --> 00:17:49.402 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:49.486 --> 00:17:51.571 position:50% align:center
[MACHIO]
What are you two doing here?

00:17:51.654 --> 00:17:53.740 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI] Uh, just lookin' for
amusement in this park!

00:17:53.823 --> 00:17:56.117 position:50% align:center
Well what a coincidence!
So are we!

00:17:56.201 --> 00:17:59.162 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI] But apparently we
missed the Roman garb memo.

00:17:59.245 --> 00:18:01.748 position:50% align:center
It's for one of the events
going on at TDL today.

00:18:01.831 --> 00:18:03.166 position:50% align:center
Oh, which event?

00:18:03.249 --> 00:18:05.210 position:50% align:center
Every year they have a day
where you can come dressed

00:18:05.293 --> 00:18:06.795 position:50% align:center
as any character you want.

00:18:06.878 --> 00:18:08.296 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
Oh!

00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:10.465 position:50% align:center
So you ducked into this tent
to change into your cosplay!

00:18:10.548 --> 00:18:13.426 position:50% align:center
Well, yeah. I started
after Midsummer Comiket.

00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:16.304 position:50% align:center
And there's really not that many
other opportunities to dress up.

00:18:16.388 --> 00:18:18.848 position:50% align:center
That's why I wanted
to ask him to join me.

00:18:18.932 --> 00:18:22.185 position:50% align:center
I heard that Destinyland offered
different cosplay events.

00:18:22.268 --> 00:18:25.814 position:50% align:center
And, wow.
I'm so glad he said yes!

00:18:25.897 --> 00:18:27.315 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
Seriously?

00:18:27.399 --> 00:18:29.401 position:50% align:center
She invited him here just so
she could stare at his pecs?

00:18:29.484 --> 00:18:31.361 position:50% align:center
[GINA]
Why else would she invite him?

00:18:31.444 --> 00:18:32.445 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
So the whole time he thought

00:18:32.529 --> 00:18:34.030 position:50% align:center
they were bonding or whatever

00:18:34.114 --> 00:18:37.826 position:50% align:center
she's just been mentally groping
his freshly waxed man mounds?

00:18:37.909 --> 00:18:40.078 position:50% align:center
That's ridiculous!
You wasted a ticket!

00:18:40.161 --> 00:18:42.831 position:50% align:center
Why come all the way out to
Destinyland, when you can just

00:18:42.914 --> 00:18:45.667 position:50% align:center
go to the gym and wait for
him to sneeze or something?

00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:48.670 position:50% align:center
[sighs] I didn't expect
you to understand it.

00:18:48.753 --> 00:18:50.005 position:50% align:center
If you're somehow
bored looking at

00:18:50.088 --> 00:18:51.297 position:50% align:center
the most beautiful muscles
in the world every day,

00:18:51.381 --> 00:18:52.757 position:50% align:center
they will become
like fresh, new muscles

00:18:52.841 --> 00:18:54.092 position:50% align:center
with a change of scenery.

00:18:54.175 --> 00:18:55.677 position:50% align:center
Not many have pecs as
sumptuous as Mr. Machio's

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:57.220 position:50% align:center
which leads me to believe
his are infused with

00:18:57.303 --> 00:18:58.346 position:50% align:center
magical angel leather

00:18:58.430 --> 00:18:59.681 position:50% align:center
only bestowed upon
the earth's finest.

00:18:59.764 --> 00:19:01.391 position:50% align:center
Even looking at him in his
precious blue track suit

00:19:01.474 --> 00:19:02.767 position:50% align:center
you can still see how
they curve and bulge

00:19:02.851 --> 00:19:04.102 position:50% align:center
with a perfect cherry on top...

00:19:04.185 --> 00:19:05.645 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI] You're creeping
me out! I'm sorry I asked!

00:19:05.729 --> 00:19:08.064 position:50% align:center
What's wrong with your
eyes? Get off me!

00:19:08.148 --> 00:19:09.357 position:50% align:center
My pecs are jumping with joy

00:19:09.441 --> 00:19:11.568 position:50% align:center
about how great of
shape they're in now!

00:19:11.651 --> 00:19:13.570 position:50% align:center
Thanks to all those incline
bench presses I did!

00:19:13.653 --> 00:19:15.447 position:50% align:center
Wow! So shredded!

00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:17.240 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI] Thanks for getting
me out of that, bro!

00:19:17.323 --> 00:19:19.200 position:50% align:center
But what's an incline
bench press?

It's a certain type

00:19:28.835 --> 00:19:31.087 position:50% align:center
that requires this specific
piece of equipment.

00:19:31.171 --> 00:19:32.964 position:50% align:center
Oh yeah, I've seen
those at the gym!

00:19:33.048 --> 00:19:35.342 position:50% align:center
I didn't realize they were
used for bench presses!

00:19:35.425 --> 00:19:37.719 position:50% align:center
[MACHIO] They target a different
part of your chest area.

00:19:37.802 --> 00:19:39.137 position:50% align:center
The presses you're used to work

00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:42.265 position:50% align:center
the central part of
your chest the most.

00:19:42.349 --> 00:19:45.143 position:50% align:center
Whereas an incline press helps
to build the center portion

00:19:45.226 --> 00:19:46.853 position:50% align:center
of your upper chest area.

00:19:46.936 --> 00:19:50.273 position:50% align:center
Yes, it will help to
increase your bust size!

00:19:50.357 --> 00:19:52.734 position:50% align:center
First step, adjust
the bench to an incline

00:19:52.817 --> 00:19:55.987 position:50% align:center
of a 30-to45 degree angle.

00:19:56.071 --> 00:19:58.948 position:50% align:center
Next, place your hands wider
than shoulder width apart,

00:19:59.032 --> 00:20:01.993 position:50% align:center
but not full "goal-post" arms
like regular bench presses.

00:20:02.077 --> 00:20:03.787 position:50% align:center
Now, lower the bar
slowly and squeeze

00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:06.081 position:50% align:center
your shoulder blades
together as you come down.

00:20:06.164 --> 00:20:08.708 position:50% align:center
Keep 'em squeezed
as you come up.

00:20:08.792 --> 00:20:12.504 position:50% align:center
Make sure to keep your feet
planted firmly on the ground.

00:20:12.587 --> 00:20:14.673 position:50% align:center
[JASON] I suggest choosing a
lighter weight than you would

00:20:14.756 --> 00:20:18.176 position:50% align:center
normally use with a
regular bench press.

00:20:18.259 --> 00:20:20.303 position:50% align:center
This is what brings
those pecs to life!

00:20:20.387 --> 00:20:23.014 position:50% align:center
Someday, you'll be able
to do this. Yeah!

00:20:23.098 --> 00:20:25.016 position:50% align:center
What are you even doing
here, Jason?!

00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:26.351 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
Good times.

00:20:26.434 --> 00:20:28.144 position:50% align:center
So, here's what our
Teacher-friend's been up to.

00:20:28.228 --> 00:20:30.271 position:50% align:center
They have to be somewhere
around here.

00:20:30.355 --> 00:20:32.399 position:50% align:center
Unless they intentionally
ditched me.

00:20:32.482 --> 00:20:34.109 position:50% align:center
I must've missed them
while I was recovering

00:20:34.192 --> 00:20:36.736 position:50% align:center
from motion sickness--
or they snuck off.

00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:38.446 position:50% align:center
[sighs] Oh, well!

00:20:38.530 --> 00:20:40.699 position:50% align:center
Since I'm disguised as a
high-school kid at Destinyland,

00:20:40.782 --> 00:20:42.409 position:50% align:center
and I may as well
make the most of it!

00:20:42.492 --> 00:20:44.494 position:50% align:center
Not like I could get away
with this anywhere else!

00:20:44.577 --> 00:20:46.246 position:50% align:center
Thank goodness no one
I know would ever be

00:20:46.329 --> 00:20:48.331 position:50% align:center
hanging around this place
because if I ran into them,

00:20:48.415 --> 00:20:51.084 position:50% align:center
I'd probably die! [laughs]

00:20:51.167 --> 00:20:53.878 position:50% align:center
[gasps, yelps]

00:20:53.962 --> 00:20:56.881 position:50% align:center
[TACHIBANA]
Oh, hi, Ms. Aina.

00:21:00.468 --> 00:21:04.973 position:50% align:center
[TACHIBANA] If I ran into
them, I'd probably die!

00:21:07.726 --> 00:21:08.727 position:50% align:center
[TACHIBANA]
How are you?

00:21:08.810 --> 00:21:11.062 position:50% align:center
[AINA]
Good. Good. About this, um...

00:21:11.146 --> 00:21:13.940 position:50% align:center
[TACHIBANA] It's fine!
We were never here! Cool?

00:21:14.024 --> 00:21:15.817 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] Hi! Remember
me and the audience?

00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:17.068 position:50% align:center
We're still here.

00:22:47.534 --> 00:22:49.703 position:50% align:center
Let's change things
up a bit for today!

00:22:49.786 --> 00:22:52.080 position:50% align:center
Who wants to learn some
bodybuilding poses?

00:22:52.163 --> 00:22:55.625 position:50% align:center
Don't be fooled, these kinds of
poses can be a light workout.

00:22:55.709 --> 00:22:57.877 position:50% align:center
Move your body
and flexes like ours!

00:22:57.961 --> 00:23:00.588 position:50% align:center
It might be easier to do
if you have a mirror nearby.

00:23:00.672 --> 00:23:03.508 position:50% align:center
First things first!
Relax your muscles!

00:23:03.591 --> 00:23:06.428 position:50% align:center
I'm ready! Let's start
with Front Double Biceps.

00:23:06.511 --> 00:23:07.846 position:50% align:center
Show me what you've got!

00:23:07.929 --> 00:23:10.473 position:50% align:center
Great! We're going to hold
it for five seconds!

00:23:10.557 --> 00:23:12.517 position:50% align:center
Biceps refers to
your upper arms.

00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:14.060 position:50% align:center
When you flex both
of them like this,

00:23:14.144 --> 00:23:16.688 position:50% align:center
you've got--say it with
me--double biceps!

00:23:16.771 --> 00:23:18.356 position:50% align:center
Now let's turn to the side.

00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:19.899 position:50% align:center
This is 'Side Chest.'

00:23:19.983 --> 00:23:22.068 position:50% align:center
[MACHIO]
Nice! Hold it for five seconds!

00:23:22.152 --> 00:23:23.695 position:50% align:center
This pose is a great
way to show off

00:23:23.778 --> 00:23:25.238 position:50% align:center
the definition in your chest,

00:23:25.321 --> 00:23:27.949 position:50% align:center
arms, shoulders, and the full
length of your leg muscles!

00:23:28.033 --> 00:23:30.410 position:50% align:center
For the last one, we're
going to stretch our arms

00:23:30.493 --> 00:23:32.287 position:50% align:center
all the way up and
then bend them back

00:23:32.370 --> 00:23:33.371 position:50% align:center
for 'Abs and Thigh!'

00:23:33.455 --> 00:23:35.206 position:50% align:center
[MACHIO] Fierce!
Give me five seconds!

00:23:35.290 --> 00:23:36.958 position:50% align:center
This one really makes
both the eight-pack

00:23:37.042 --> 00:23:38.460 position:50% align:center
and those thigh mountains pop,

00:23:38.543 --> 00:23:40.587 position:50% align:center
so flex from deep
below the muscle!

00:23:40.670 --> 00:23:42.672 position:50% align:center
If you don't have a full-length
mirror available,

00:23:42.756 --> 00:23:45.383 position:50% align:center
try setting up a camera and
learning from your play-back.

00:23:45.467 --> 00:23:47.010 position:50% align:center
And even Mockey knows...

00:23:47.093 --> 00:23:49.220 position:50% align:center
[ALL] ...true strength
comes from within!
