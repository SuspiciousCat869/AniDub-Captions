One...

00:07:51.554 --> 00:07:53.056 position:50% align:center
Two...

00:07:53.139 --> 00:07:54.557 position:50% align:center
Three...

00:07:54.641 --> 00:07:56.267 position:50% align:center
That's four.

00:07:56.351 --> 00:07:57.894 position:50% align:center
Five...

00:07:57.977 --> 00:07:59.187 position:50% align:center
Six...

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:02.649 position:50% align:center
This is hard.
Even with light weights.

00:08:02.732 --> 00:08:04.234 position:50% align:center
How many more are left?

00:08:04.317 --> 00:08:06.486 position:50% align:center
[MACHIO] Best part is, you don't
even need to buy a dumbbell set

00:08:06.569 --> 00:08:07.904 position:50% align:center
for that amount of weight!

00:08:07.987 --> 00:08:10.448 position:50% align:center
An average sized bottle of water
would work just as well!

00:08:10.532 --> 00:08:11.825 position:50% align:center
[TACHIBANA]
How 'bout a small one?

00:08:11.908 --> 00:08:14.452 position:50% align:center
Yeah! Ms. Tachibana
bein' a boss!

00:08:14.536 --> 00:08:16.079 position:50% align:center
Are you two finished already?

00:08:16.162 --> 00:08:17.288 position:50% align:center
Hell yeah!

00:08:17.372 --> 00:08:19.124 position:50% align:center
We nailed those sets
like hammerhead sharks!

00:08:19.207 --> 00:08:20.709 position:50% align:center
Wow, that's impressive!

00:08:20.792 --> 00:08:22.836 position:50% align:center
Look how much your stamina's
already increased!

00:08:22.919 --> 00:08:24.546 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:08:24.629 --> 00:08:25.714 position:50% align:center
What the--?

00:08:25.797 --> 00:08:28.174 position:50% align:center
Um. Ms. Tachibana?
I don't wanna interrupt

00:08:28.258 --> 00:08:29.217 position:50% align:center
your training session, but--

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:31.845 position:50% align:center
Too late.
What's up, Ms. Soryuin?

00:08:31.928 --> 00:08:33.722 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI] I just noticed
the diamond tan line

00:08:33.805 --> 00:08:34.931 position:50% align:center
on your stomach.

00:08:35.015 --> 00:08:36.933 position:50% align:center
What's it from?
I've never seen that before.

00:08:37.017 --> 00:08:40.395 position:50% align:center
[gasps] No!

00:08:41.312 --> 00:08:44.399 position:50% align:center
Whoa, that's weird. You must
have a freaky swimsuit.

00:08:44.482 --> 00:08:46.192 position:50% align:center
No. I... um...

00:08:46.276 --> 00:08:49.279 position:50% align:center
I was experimenting with a few
to see which one looked best.

00:08:49.362 --> 00:08:50.822 position:50% align:center
Oh. Nice.

00:08:50.905 --> 00:08:53.158 position:50% align:center
You got one of those guys who
likes "variety," don't you?

00:08:53.241 --> 00:08:55.368 position:50% align:center
Sure. Can we change
the subject, please?

00:08:55.452 --> 00:08:57.829 position:50% align:center
[MACHIO] Come on, you two, let
her get back to her workout.

00:08:57.912 --> 00:08:58.705 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:08:58.788 --> 00:09:00.498 position:50% align:center
Ms. Tachibana is a grown woman,

00:09:00.582 --> 00:09:01.916 position:50% align:center
and what she does
in her private time

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.710 position:50% align:center
is none of our business, okay?

00:09:03.793 --> 00:09:04.753 position:50% align:center
Uh!

00:09:04.836 --> 00:09:06.755 position:50% align:center
To each their own.
Even teachers!

00:09:06.838 --> 00:09:08.673 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI, AKEMI]
'Kay!

00:09:08.757 --> 00:09:10.425 position:50% align:center
[TACHIBANA] I appreciate
him coming to my rescue

00:09:10.508 --> 00:09:11.760 position:50% align:center
like that, but...

00:09:11.843 --> 00:09:14.679 position:50% align:center
They could not be more wrong
about what I'm into.

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:20.935 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI groans]
I need a nap!

00:09:21.019 --> 00:09:22.896 position:50% align:center
Ms. Tachibana, high five!

00:09:22.979 --> 00:09:25.940 position:50% align:center
Yeah, good work today.
Be safe getting home, 'kay?

00:09:26.024 --> 00:09:28.943 position:50% align:center
PS. All secrets shared in
the gym stay in the gym!

00:09:29.027 --> 00:09:31.237 position:50% align:center
There's been a misunderstanding!
It's not what you think!

00:09:31.321 --> 00:09:32.947 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
Ugh! I'm starving!

00:09:33.031 --> 00:09:35.075 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI] Yeah, you pushed
really hard today!

00:09:35.158 --> 00:09:36.451 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
Cool, so can we eat?

00:09:36.534 --> 00:09:37.994 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI]
I've got some protein bars?

00:09:38.078 --> 00:09:39.954 position:50% align:center
--[HIBIKI] I mean like, food!
--[AKEMI] That is food!

00:09:40.038 --> 00:09:41.748 position:50% align:center
[TACHIBANA]
Why did I panic like that?

00:09:41.831 --> 00:09:44.501 position:50% align:center
It's not like my real
secret was revealed.

00:09:46.628 --> 00:09:49.839 position:50% align:center
[TACHIBANA] No student would
ever take me seriously again.

00:09:49.923 --> 00:09:53.259 position:50% align:center
A cosplayer teacher?
They'd lose their minds.

00:09:53.343 --> 00:09:54.928 position:50% align:center
Seems like a lot of
my looks were feeling

00:09:55.011 --> 00:09:57.389 position:50% align:center
a little bit tighter
after the last event.

00:09:57.472 --> 00:09:58.890 position:50% align:center
The gym was a good idea.

00:09:58.973 --> 00:10:01.518 position:50% align:center
I've gotta get back in shape
before the next one.

00:10:01.601 --> 00:10:03.144 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR 1A]
Little amendment from earlier:

00:10:03.228 --> 00:10:05.522 position:50% align:center
Although she's known by many
as their history teacher,

00:10:05.605 --> 00:10:07.524 position:50% align:center
there are also those
who know Ms. Tachibana

00:10:07.607 --> 00:10:10.193 position:50% align:center
as the famous cosplayer,
Yulia Riko.

00:10:10.276 --> 00:10:12.862 position:50% align:center
Her motivation on this
fitness journey?

00:10:12.946 --> 00:10:15.990 position:50% align:center
She's preparing
for a major event.

00:10:19.327 --> 00:10:21.913 position:50% align:center
[AYAKA] Oh, so you two
are going to the same gym!

00:10:21.996 --> 00:10:24.708 position:50% align:center
That makes way more sense!
You're way too good for Hibiki.

00:10:24.791 --> 00:10:27.252 position:50% align:center
Thanks Miss Uehara,
that's nice of you to say.

00:10:27.335 --> 00:10:28.878 position:50% align:center
Do you see my grandma here?

00:10:28.962 --> 00:10:30.588 position:50% align:center
Girl, just call me Ayaka.

00:10:30.672 --> 00:10:31.840 position:50% align:center
You guys, I'm starving.

00:10:31.923 --> 00:10:33.758 position:50% align:center
Can you continue to bond
while we eat, please?

00:10:33.842 --> 00:10:35.635 position:50% align:center
You're not "starving,"
you're just hangry,

00:10:35.719 --> 00:10:39.222 position:50% align:center
and you need to tell that
tummy monster to chill.

00:10:39.305 --> 00:10:40.724 position:50% align:center
Thanks for letting me
eat with you.

00:10:40.807 --> 00:10:42.726 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
Woo-hoo! Lunch time rules!

00:10:42.809 --> 00:10:46.813 position:50% align:center
[AYAKA] No way. Did she pack
lunches for all of us, or...?

00:10:46.896 --> 00:10:49.190 position:50% align:center
[AYAKA] Is it just me,
or does your bento box

00:10:49.274 --> 00:10:50.900 position:50% align:center
look a little different today?

00:10:50.984 --> 00:10:52.235 position:50% align:center
It's larger.

00:10:52.318 --> 00:10:54.487 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I found a bigger one
at home, so I thought,

00:10:54.571 --> 00:10:58.324 position:50% align:center
"why not?" But I packed the
same things as I always do.

00:10:58.408 --> 00:10:59.993 position:50% align:center
See? Same ol' stuff!

00:11:00.076 --> 00:11:01.703 position:50% align:center
[AYAKA] What, are you
feeding a sports team?

00:11:01.786 --> 00:11:04.039 position:50% align:center
Is all this supposed
to be one meal for you?

00:11:04.122 --> 00:11:06.166 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
No. It's my breakfast, too!

00:11:06.249 --> 00:11:07.917 position:50% align:center
I like to sleep as
late as possible.

00:11:08.001 --> 00:11:10.962 position:50% align:center
So I don't always have time
to eat before I leave!

00:11:11.046 --> 00:11:12.922 position:50% align:center
There're reality shows
about people like you!

00:11:13.006 --> 00:11:15.008 position:50% align:center
I'm trying not to eat
until lunch time.

00:11:15.091 --> 00:11:16.426 position:50% align:center
Aren't you proud of me
for cutting back

00:11:16.509 --> 00:11:18.011 position:50% align:center
on some of my meals?

00:11:18.094 --> 00:11:20.430 position:50% align:center
Everyone was giving me attitude
about snacks, so they're gone.

00:11:20.513 --> 00:11:23.308 position:50% align:center
Now I'm on this diet where
I only eat once a day!

00:11:23.391 --> 00:11:26.478 position:50% align:center
Uh, except you weren't
created with will power.

00:11:26.561 --> 00:11:28.772 position:50% align:center
Yeah-huh! I just haven't
used it, yet!

00:11:28.855 --> 00:11:30.732 position:50% align:center
My body's gonna be so
bangin' this summer--

00:11:30.815 --> 00:11:31.941 position:50% align:center
you don't even know!

00:11:32.025 --> 00:11:35.028 position:50% align:center
Okay, hold on.
That's not a diet.

00:11:35.111 --> 00:11:37.238 position:50% align:center
It actually has
the opposite effect.

00:11:37.322 --> 00:11:40.116 position:50% align:center
I mean, Sumo wrestlers eat
like that to gain weight

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:41.910 position:50% align:center
for their matches.

00:11:42.619 --> 00:11:43.995 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI gasping]

00:11:45.663 --> 00:11:48.083 position:50% align:center
Time for Akemi's Diet Lesson!

00:11:48.166 --> 00:11:51.127 position:50% align:center
When your body's been deprived
of food for several hours,

00:11:51.211 --> 00:11:52.837 position:50% align:center
and then you decide to binge,

00:11:52.921 --> 00:11:55.632 position:50% align:center
your blood sugar levels
increase drastically.

00:11:55.715 --> 00:11:58.635 position:50% align:center
This causes the pancreas to
secrete tons of insulin--

00:11:58.718 --> 00:12:01.137 position:50% align:center
a hormone that distributes
energy--or calories--

00:12:01.221 --> 00:12:02.430 position:50% align:center
to cells where it is needed,

00:12:02.514 --> 00:12:04.808 position:50% align:center
overeating provokes
excess insulin.

00:12:04.891 --> 00:12:06.518 position:50% align:center
With nowhere else to go,
this "energy"

00:12:06.601 --> 00:12:09.020 position:50% align:center
is distributed to the
muscles and fat cells.

00:12:09.104 --> 00:12:11.898 position:50% align:center
Your body reads this as a need
to survive and stores fat

00:12:11.981 --> 00:12:13.692 position:50% align:center
to protect you from starvation.

00:12:13.775 --> 00:12:16.778 position:50% align:center
In other words, skipping
important meals isn't helping.

00:12:16.861 --> 00:12:18.363 position:50% align:center
When you eat a huge
lunch instead of

00:12:18.446 --> 00:12:19.614 position:50% align:center
eating breakfast or dinner,

00:12:19.698 --> 00:12:21.991 position:50% align:center
you'll probably notice
you gain weight faster.

00:12:22.075 --> 00:12:24.077 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that makes sense to me.

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:27.706 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI] Uh! I'm doing
everything the wrong way!

00:12:27.789 --> 00:12:29.916 position:50% align:center
There's no chance I'll be
skinny by summer now!

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.418 position:50% align:center
Hibiki, you're fine.

00:12:31.501 --> 00:12:33.420 position:50% align:center
There's plenty of
time before summer!

00:12:33.503 --> 00:12:36.548 position:50% align:center
Have you ever considered trying
a basic bodybuilder's diet?

00:12:36.631 --> 00:12:39.259 position:50% align:center
What? They have their
own specific diet?

00:12:39.342 --> 00:12:42.053 position:50% align:center
[BODYBUILDER 3A grunting]

00:12:43.638 --> 00:12:44.931 position:50% align:center
Is that what it is?

00:12:45.015 --> 00:12:46.766 position:50% align:center
This is what you're imagining?

00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:48.810 position:50% align:center
Why do you have him screaming
while he's eating?

00:12:48.893 --> 00:12:50.395 position:50% align:center
It's not what you're thinking.

00:12:50.478 --> 00:12:53.273 position:50% align:center
It's more than just lifting
the most amount of weight.

00:12:53.356 --> 00:12:56.401 position:50% align:center
It's like an artform. They also
focus on cutting and shaping

00:12:56.484 --> 00:12:58.028 position:50% align:center
for aesthetics and try to be

00:12:58.111 --> 00:13:00.530 position:50% align:center
under 3% body fat
before competitions.

00:13:00.613 --> 00:13:02.449 position:50% align:center
Whoa! Under 3%?

00:13:02.532 --> 00:13:04.159 position:50% align:center
That's also what boxers aim for

00:13:04.242 --> 00:13:05.827 position:50% align:center
before they're
scheduled to fight.

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:07.454 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI] When it comes
to precise dieting,

00:13:07.537 --> 00:13:09.247 position:50% align:center
bodybuilders are the experts.

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:11.499 position:50% align:center
Here, let's take a look
at my bento box.

00:13:11.583 --> 00:13:13.084 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI gasps]

00:13:13.168 --> 00:13:16.546 position:50% align:center
Wow! Look how colorful it its!
Hibiki, are you taking notes?

00:13:16.629 --> 00:13:19.591 position:50% align:center
I always make sure my meal
is nutritionally balanced.

00:13:19.674 --> 00:13:23.386 position:50% align:center
[AYAKA] Yeah, Hibiki loves
herself a hot fried mess.

00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:27.223 position:50% align:center
Yours is grilled, and steamed,
and whole. That's frikkin sexy!

00:13:27.307 --> 00:13:28.641 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
I get it!

00:13:28.725 --> 00:13:31.311 position:50% align:center
It's not the food. I bet we're
eating the same things.

00:13:31.394 --> 00:13:34.105 position:50% align:center
It's how you prepare it that
can add or subtract calories.

00:13:34.189 --> 00:13:35.440 position:50% align:center
What are you saying?

00:13:35.523 --> 00:13:37.150 position:50% align:center
When the amount of
nutrients is the same,

00:13:37.233 --> 00:13:40.445 position:50% align:center
try to choose the
lower calorie option.

00:13:40.528 --> 00:13:42.781 position:50% align:center
I know that grilled
stuff is good for me.

00:13:42.864 --> 00:13:44.657 position:50% align:center
But even if I ate it
for all three meals,

00:13:44.741 --> 00:13:47.035 position:50% align:center
I'd still be hungry!
I need more!

00:13:47.118 --> 00:13:49.371 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI] That's why I eat a few
snacks throughout the day.

00:13:49.454 --> 00:13:51.623 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI] Seriously? How do
you snack and stay skinty?

00:13:51.706 --> 00:13:54.793 position:50% align:center
Because I only snack twice a day
and my meals are much smaller.

00:13:54.876 --> 00:13:56.419 position:50% align:center
Plus, you just started.

00:13:56.503 --> 00:13:58.421 position:50% align:center
This is how a bodybuilder's
diet works.

00:13:58.505 --> 00:14:00.382 position:50% align:center
You never want
to stuff yourself.

00:14:00.465 --> 00:14:02.217 position:50% align:center
You decrease the amount
of food you eat,

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:04.761 position:50% align:center
but you eat smaller
meals more often.

00:14:04.844 --> 00:14:07.180 position:50% align:center
This prevents your blood
sugar from spiking out,

00:14:07.263 --> 00:14:09.140 position:50% align:center
because you're never
actually taking in calories

00:14:09.224 --> 00:14:10.642 position:50% align:center
on an empty stomach.

00:14:10.725 --> 00:14:13.978 position:50% align:center
Examples of some good-sized
snacks include protein bars.

00:14:14.062 --> 00:14:15.814 position:50% align:center
Or maybe a can of mackerel.

00:14:15.897 --> 00:14:17.982 position:50% align:center
There's also protein
drinks, of course!

00:14:18.066 --> 00:14:21.486 position:50% align:center
Just choose meals that are high
in protein and low in calories.

00:14:21.569 --> 00:14:24.364 position:50% align:center
That's why Mr. Machio said
we should keep eating.

00:14:24.447 --> 00:14:25.782 position:50% align:center
That's what I'm gonna do!

00:14:25.865 --> 00:14:28.702 position:50% align:center
I'm switching to a bodybuilder's
diet starting now!

00:14:28.785 --> 00:14:31.329 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna be hot AF this summer!

I don't know if I can!

00:14:39.921 --> 00:14:43.091 position:50% align:center
[AYAKA] Are you kidding me? She
gave up before she even started!

00:14:43.174 --> 00:14:45.218 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI]
Cheer up, it'll all be okay!

00:14:45.301 --> 00:14:47.721 position:50% align:center
You never have to cut those
high calorie comfort foods

00:14:47.804 --> 00:14:49.347 position:50% align:center
from your diet completely!

00:14:49.431 --> 00:14:52.308 position:50% align:center
Take a cheat day.
Eat whatever you want.

00:14:52.392 --> 00:14:55.020 position:50% align:center
It actually makes your
diet more effective!

00:14:55.103 --> 00:14:56.604 position:50% align:center
When you're on a
low-calorie diet,

00:14:56.688 --> 00:14:58.481 position:50% align:center
your body will eventually think.

00:14:58.565 --> 00:15:00.900 position:50% align:center
[FIGURE 3A]
I haven't eaten enough today.

00:15:00.984 --> 00:15:04.279 position:50% align:center
That's when it enters
energy-saving mode.

00:15:04.362 --> 00:15:06.281 position:50% align:center
The cheat day can
counteract this.

Strategically indulging tricks
your body into thinking

00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:10.493 position:50% align:center
it's got enough
calories to expend

00:15:10.577 --> 00:15:12.370 position:50% align:center
and gives your
metabolism a boost.

00:15:12.454 --> 00:15:14.247 position:50% align:center
[FIGURE 3A]
Mm! I have lots of calories!

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:16.499 position:50% align:center
Cool, so I can lose weight
by eating junk food?

00:15:16.583 --> 00:15:17.917 position:50% align:center
While we're here, can I just say

00:15:18.001 --> 00:15:20.587 position:50% align:center
it's great for stress release,
too? Or is that just me?

00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:21.921 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI]
Different subject!

00:15:22.005 --> 00:15:23.590 position:50% align:center
Having one cheat day
a week can be good

00:15:23.673 --> 00:15:25.008 position:50% align:center
when starting a new diet.

00:15:25.091 --> 00:15:28.094 position:50% align:center
Yes! I can do this now!
Thank you!

No, wait, you're doing it wrong!

00:15:48.239 --> 00:15:50.450 position:50% align:center
Your body has to get used
to low calories first,

00:15:50.533 --> 00:15:52.202 position:50% align:center
otherwise it's not gonna work!

00:15:52.285 --> 00:15:53.244 position:50% align:center

Thank goodness.

00:16:11.262 --> 00:16:13.556 position:50% align:center
Joining that gym
definitely paid off.

00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:17.477 position:50% align:center
I lost exactly what I needed to,
and just in time for the show.

00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:21.356 position:50% align:center
My body still isn't where I want
it to be, but I'm getting there.

00:16:21.439 --> 00:16:23.400 position:50% align:center
Mr. Machio's a great trainer.

00:16:23.483 --> 00:16:26.403 position:50% align:center
He made hitting the gym five
days a week after work bearable.

00:16:26.486 --> 00:16:29.030 position:50% align:center
I actually enjoyed
working out with him.

00:16:29.114 --> 00:16:31.449 position:50% align:center
I don't think I'll ever get used
to going to the same gym

00:16:31.533 --> 00:16:33.159 position:50% align:center
as my students, though.

At least they never figured out
the real reason I was there.

been into cosplay?

No, a friend of mine
just invited me out here

then he got a cold...

I recognize your costume.

I would hope so.

00:17:24.294 --> 00:17:25.795 position:50% align:center
It's from the very
first muscle manga.

00:17:25.879 --> 00:17:27.964 position:50% align:center
It was called <i>Lifts</i>
<i>With a Straight Bar</i> .

remember that series!

to collect it growing up!

it was serialized

Position it just above
your collar bone.

Lift the bar, being careful not
to fully extend your elbows.

00:20:09.125 --> 00:20:11.044 position:50% align:center
That could've been really bad.

00:20:11.127 --> 00:20:13.421 position:50% align:center
I just didn't think I'd
ever run into students here.

00:20:13.505 --> 00:20:15.757 position:50% align:center
But I'm safe.
They didn't see me.

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:17.926 position:50% align:center
Wait, Is that Ms. Tachibana?

00:20:18.009 --> 00:20:18.927 position:50% align:center
Yeah, you're right!

00:20:19.010 --> 00:20:20.720 position:50% align:center
Hey! How's it goin'?

00:20:20.804 --> 00:20:22.889 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
I didn't know you were here!

00:20:22.972 --> 00:20:25.892 position:50% align:center
[TACHIBANA]
I need to die. Right now.

00:20:25.975 --> 00:20:28.812 position:50% align:center
Huh? What's with the luggage?

00:20:29.604 --> 00:20:32.440 position:50% align:center
[laughs] I think I know.

00:20:32.524 --> 00:20:33.775 position:50% align:center
But you don't have to worry.

00:20:33.858 --> 00:20:37.070 position:50% align:center
Your secret's safe with me.
You're into BL, too?

00:20:37.153 --> 00:20:40.490 position:50% align:center
They had some good bulk
deals here. Stockin' up?

00:20:40.573 --> 00:20:43.159 position:50% align:center
Don't tell anyone
at school, okay?

00:20:43.243 --> 00:20:46.287 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR 1A] And so, a new
misunderstanding was born.

00:20:46.371 --> 00:20:47.706 position:50% align:center
Ms. Tachibana was relieved

00:20:47.789 --> 00:20:50.542 position:50% align:center
because it meant that her
real secret remained safe.

00:20:50.625 --> 00:20:53.753 position:50% align:center
Meanwhile, online
Mr. Machio was trending hard.

00:20:53.837 --> 00:20:57.132 position:50% align:center
Several nearly nude photos of
him were suddenly everywhere.

00:20:57.215 --> 00:21:00.135 position:50% align:center
I don't get it. What the heck
is a Muscle King?

00:22:30.517 --> 00:22:32.185 position:50% align:center
Hey, there!
Are you ready to review

00:22:32.268 --> 00:22:33.687 position:50% align:center
those dumbbell curls we learned?

00:22:33.770 --> 00:22:36.064 position:50% align:center
Grab anything you can
comfortably hold as a weight!

00:22:36.147 --> 00:22:38.566 position:50% align:center
About two kilograms
would be just right.

00:22:38.650 --> 00:22:40.568 position:50% align:center
Whatever you're using
should feel about as heavy

00:22:40.652 --> 00:22:42.320 position:50% align:center
as a large bottle of water.

00:22:42.404 --> 00:22:44.823 position:50% align:center
You can also use a bag with a
handle and fill it with books,

00:22:44.906 --> 00:22:46.032 position:50% align:center
or whatever you like.

00:22:46.116 --> 00:22:47.826 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
Sounds good. Are you ready?

00:22:47.909 --> 00:22:49.786 position:50% align:center
[MACHIO] Stand with your feet
shoulder width apart.

00:22:49.869 --> 00:22:51.538 position:50% align:center
Completely relax your shoulders,

00:22:51.621 --> 00:22:54.374 position:50% align:center
keep elbows to the side and
bend them slowly as you lift.

00:22:54.457 --> 00:22:56.626 position:50% align:center
[AYAKA] It looks easy,
but it is a challenge.

00:22:56.710 --> 00:22:58.461 position:50% align:center
[TACHIBANA]
Let's start with the right arm.

00:22:58.545 --> 00:23:01.589 position:50% align:center
And whenever you're ready, go!

00:23:01.673 --> 00:23:03.717 position:50% align:center
And one.

00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:05.343 position:50% align:center
Two...

00:23:05.427 --> 00:23:09.597 position:50% align:center
Lift and rotate your
palms facing up.

00:23:09.681 --> 00:23:13.977 position:50% align:center
Keep your elbows pressed to your
sides so you don't use momentum.

00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:15.437 position:50% align:center
Oh, man. Do you feel that?

00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:18.356 position:50% align:center
Feels like your
muscles are growing.

00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:19.858 position:50% align:center
Make sure you keep the rhythm.

00:23:19.941 --> 00:23:22.736 position:50% align:center
Now's when you're
gonna have to push.

00:23:22.819 --> 00:23:24.487 position:50% align:center
My arms are about to fall off.

00:23:24.571 --> 00:23:27.407 position:50% align:center
No they're not! The Muscle
King will give you strength!

00:23:27.490 --> 00:23:30.118 position:50% align:center
[AYAKA]
Careful not to overextend.

00:23:30.201 --> 00:23:31.369 position:50% align:center
[MACHIO]
...14...

00:23:31.453 --> 00:23:32.370 position:50% align:center
Last one!

00:23:32.454 --> 00:23:33.455 position:50% align:center
[MACHIO]
15!

00:23:33.538 --> 00:23:35.290 position:50% align:center
Dumbbell Superstar!

00:23:35.373 --> 00:23:36.499 position:50% align:center
Add this to your regular workout

00:23:36.583 --> 00:23:38.585 position:50% align:center
and those arms will
be strong and firm!

00:23:38.668 --> 00:23:40.128 position:50% align:center
And always remember, fam:

00:23:40.211 --> 00:23:41.880 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
True strength comes from within!

00:23:41.963 --> 00:23:43.590 position:50% align:center
Don't forget about
your left arm!

00:23:43.673 --> 00:23:45.633 position:50% align:center
Rock it out during
the commercial break!

00:23:45.717 --> 00:23:47.719 position:50% align:center
Switching to the other hand.

00:23:47.802 --> 00:23:50.013 position:50% align:center
And... here we go!
