[NARRATOR] It's the day
before spring break,

00:00:12.595 --> 00:00:15.015 position:50% align:center
and you know what that means!

00:00:15.098 --> 00:00:17.517 position:50% align:center
[MACHIO] We're organizing
an actual vacation this time!

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.561 position:50% align:center
There've been a lot
of events here lately.

00:00:19.644 --> 00:00:21.229 position:50% align:center
The only thing I
can see is the model

00:00:21.312 --> 00:00:23.231 position:50% align:center
so you can't really tell
what the event is.

00:00:23.314 --> 00:00:25.316 position:50% align:center
It's being held at Nikunoshima!

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.901 position:50% align:center
Do you mean Muscle Island?

00:00:26.985 --> 00:00:28.486 position:50% align:center
[MACHIO]
That's right!

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.156 position:50% align:center
It's in the Tokyo area, but has
tropical climate all year long

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:33.116 position:50% align:center
which makes it a popular
spring break spot

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:35.160 position:50% align:center
for all you crazy youngsters.

00:00:35.243 --> 00:00:37.078 position:50% align:center
I can't wait! I'm going, too!

00:00:37.162 --> 00:00:39.330 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI] You're taking all
that with you to the ocean?

00:00:39.414 --> 00:00:41.541 position:50% align:center
Quit worrying about what
he's packing and sign up.

00:00:41.624 --> 00:00:43.877 position:50% align:center
We're buying snazzy new
swimsuits for the occasion.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.130 position:50% align:center
Ayaka's bringing her sister,
your teachers are also on board,

00:00:47.213 --> 00:00:50.300 position:50% align:center
Ms. Kure, Ms. Aina, and Ms.
Tachibana have all signed up,

00:00:50.383 --> 00:00:52.010 position:50% align:center
so it's lookin' like
a great time so far!

00:00:52.093 --> 00:00:54.137 position:50% align:center
I get it now!
Aside from Ms. Kure,

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.806 position:50% align:center
everyone going is clawing the
walls for some beach bae action!

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:57.974 position:50% align:center
Keep it down!

00:00:58.058 --> 00:00:59.893 position:50% align:center
Jason's got other
plans so unfortunately

00:00:59.976 --> 00:01:01.478 position:50% align:center
he won't be joining us.

00:01:01.561 --> 00:01:04.606 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI] Seriously? How does he
expect to ever build his harem?

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:07.233 position:50% align:center
Honestly, I wish I could go.
But I've already promised

00:01:07.317 --> 00:01:09.235 position:50% align:center
to work on student council
projects this spring.

00:01:09.319 --> 00:01:11.363 position:50% align:center
Oh, that's right.
I forgot I made plans

00:01:11.446 --> 00:01:13.365 position:50% align:center
with my movie collection
over this break.

00:01:13.448 --> 00:01:16.201 position:50% align:center
All those new ones piling up
aren't gonna watch themselves.

00:01:16.284 --> 00:01:19.037 position:50% align:center
That's too bad.
You will be sorely missed.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.206 position:50% align:center
There are several events
I thought you'd like.

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:23.792 position:50% align:center
The Mr. Nikunoshima
contest, for example.

00:01:23.875 --> 00:01:25.377 position:50% align:center
We'll send you pics!

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.048 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI] A contest on the beach.
That means pecs on pecs on pecs.

00:01:30.131 --> 00:01:31.549 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
Hot boyfriend odds stacked.

00:01:31.633 --> 00:01:34.344 position:50% align:center
All right, now that I know
who's not lame and likes fun,

00:01:34.427 --> 00:01:35.679 position:50% align:center
I'll go ahead and
make the reservation!

00:01:35.762 --> 00:01:36.930 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI, HIBIKI]
I'm going, too!

00:01:37.013 --> 00:01:39.599 position:50% align:center
[MACHIO] I don't wanna
interrupt your plans!

00:01:39.683 --> 00:01:40.934 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI] Just a little
time-budgeting!

00:01:41.017 --> 00:01:42.602 position:50% align:center
I can get everything done
before the break starts!

00:01:42.686 --> 00:01:43.853 position:50% align:center
[MACHIO]
Are you guys sure?

00:01:43.937 --> 00:01:46.231 position:50% align:center
Hell yeah! The only thing
we need to do now

00:01:46.314 --> 00:01:47.982 position:50% align:center
is buy some smokin'
new swimsuits!

00:01:48.066 --> 00:01:48.942 position:50% align:center
Yep, yep!

00:01:49.025 --> 00:01:50.360 position:50% align:center
Let's go try some on together!

00:01:50.443 --> 00:01:52.779 position:50% align:center
Why does there have to be
guys for them to join?

00:01:52.862 --> 00:01:54.280 position:50% align:center
[AYAKA] Are you kidding?
Have you met them?

00:01:54.364 --> 00:01:55.990 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI] Hibiki, you can't go
for every guy on the beach!

00:01:56.074 --> 00:01:57.283 position:50% align:center
There's someone for everyone!

00:01:57.367 --> 00:01:58.618 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI] Then let's decide
which guys are yours

00:01:58.702 --> 00:01:59.494 position:50% align:center
and which ones are mine.

00:01:59.577 --> 00:02:00.912 position:50% align:center
[JASON]
There they are!

00:02:00.995 --> 00:02:03.289 position:50% align:center
Don't they make
the perfect cast?

00:02:03.373 --> 00:02:05.834 position:50% align:center
They're just the most
beautiful ladies.

00:02:05.917 --> 00:02:07.711 position:50% align:center
This is so exciting!
You were right!

00:02:07.794 --> 00:02:09.295 position:50% align:center
[BOTH laughing]

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:11.506 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] If you're wondering
"when did this become a thing?"

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:13.091 position:50% align:center
You're not alone.

00:02:13.174 --> 00:02:14.968 position:50% align:center
Only one way to find out!

00:03:49.562 --> 00:03:50.689 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
Guess where we are now?

00:03:50.772 --> 00:03:52.941 position:50% align:center
That's Nikunoshima.

00:03:53.024 --> 00:03:54.609 position:50% align:center
It's spring break and our

00:03:54.693 --> 00:03:57.070 position:50% align:center
Silverman Gym buddies
have arrived!

00:03:57.153 --> 00:03:59.989 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI]
Wow! It looks just like a photo!

00:04:00.073 --> 00:04:02.242 position:50% align:center
This ocean is giving me life!

00:04:02.325 --> 00:04:04.452 position:50% align:center
I had no idea this island
was smack dab in the middle

00:04:04.536 --> 00:04:07.497 position:50% align:center
of the ocean. Uh!
Gina, are you drunk?

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:09.624 position:50% align:center
[GINA groaning]
So hot.

00:04:09.708 --> 00:04:12.252 position:50% align:center
Looks like the Russian ice
queen can't handle the heat!

00:04:12.335 --> 00:04:13.795 position:50% align:center
If she's not used
to this climate,

00:04:13.878 --> 00:04:15.755 position:50% align:center
she could probably get sick.

00:04:15.839 --> 00:04:18.925 position:50% align:center
You're right. We bad guys
all have cold hearts.

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:20.677 position:50% align:center
My evil blood is melting away.

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.721 position:50% align:center
If you can work in that
sorry excuse for a joke,

00:04:22.804 --> 00:04:24.264 position:50% align:center
you must be fine.

00:04:24.347 --> 00:04:26.433 position:50% align:center
[GINA] You know what they say,
if you can't take the heat.

00:04:26.516 --> 00:04:28.059 position:50% align:center
Get out of the clothes!

00:04:28.143 --> 00:04:29.394 position:50% align:center
"Get out of the kitchen!"

00:04:29.477 --> 00:04:30.770 position:50% align:center
Which sounds nothing like
"take off your clothes!"

00:04:30.854 --> 00:04:32.897 position:50% align:center
She's overheated, go get
her something to drink!

00:04:32.981 --> 00:04:34.899 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Cheers!

00:04:34.983 --> 00:04:36.484 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] I heard "drink"
and remembered to check in

00:04:36.568 --> 00:04:39.988 position:50% align:center
on the grown-ups.
Looks like all's well!

00:04:40.071 --> 00:04:42.949 position:50% align:center
Yeah, there ya go. Take a swim.
It'll cool you off.

00:04:43.033 --> 00:04:45.076 position:50% align:center
[GINA]
Thanks for the advice, jerk.

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.245 position:50% align:center
[MACHIO] Hey, fam!
Sorry to keep you waiting!

00:04:47.328 --> 00:04:48.621 position:50% align:center
Check this out!

00:04:48.705 --> 00:04:51.291 position:50% align:center
I saw a bunch of giant melons
and had to grab one!

00:04:51.374 --> 00:04:52.751 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI] Maybe it's because
you're holding it

00:04:52.834 --> 00:04:55.378 position:50% align:center
while you're huge,
but that looks tiny.

00:04:55.462 --> 00:04:56.421 position:50% align:center
[gasping]

00:04:56.504 --> 00:04:58.048 position:50% align:center
Why's that melon so big?

00:04:58.131 --> 00:04:59.924 position:50% align:center
And how is Mr. Machio
so garganch

00:05:00.008 --> 00:05:01.593 position:50% align:center
that he made it look so tiny?

00:05:01.676 --> 00:05:04.262 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI] We can buy a wooden
sword here and slice it open.

00:05:04.346 --> 00:05:05.263 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
Ocean.

00:05:05.347 --> 00:05:06.348 position:50% align:center
A melon.

00:05:06.431 --> 00:05:07.849 position:50% align:center
Wooden sword.

00:05:07.932 --> 00:05:09.684 position:50% align:center
Put 'em together
and what do you got?

00:05:09.768 --> 00:05:11.227 position:50% align:center
A sad attempt at a haiku?

00:05:11.311 --> 00:05:13.521 position:50% align:center
There's only one thing we could
possibly do with all three

00:05:13.605 --> 00:05:16.191 position:50% align:center
of these items! A pose-off
with the melon and sword!

00:05:16.274 --> 00:05:18.651 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS]
A melon bash, duh!

00:05:18.735 --> 00:05:19.736 position:50% align:center
I haven't done a...

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:20.987 position:50% align:center
[MACHIO]
Oh, right.

00:05:21.071 --> 00:05:23.323 position:50% align:center
Guess there's always that.
My bad.

00:05:23.406 --> 00:05:24.866 position:50% align:center
Why don't you cry over it?

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:28.161 position:50% align:center
Oh, I have a great idea!
Let's do trainee-style rules!

00:05:28.244 --> 00:05:29.871 position:50% align:center
[AYAKA, HIBIKI]
Trainee? What?

00:05:29.954 --> 00:05:31.498 position:50% align:center
Have you never heard
of that before?

00:05:31.581 --> 00:05:34.250 position:50% align:center
The person swinging at the melon
has to do it blindfolded.

00:05:34.334 --> 00:05:35.251 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
Uh-huh.

00:05:35.335 --> 00:05:36.836 position:50% align:center
[AYAKA]
That's how it usually is.

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:38.088 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI]
Yeah, but then you put the melon

00:05:38.171 --> 00:05:39.714 position:50% align:center
on Mr. Machio's Trap muscles!

00:05:39.798 --> 00:05:41.883 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI] That's ridiculous!
Just put it on the ground!

00:05:41.966 --> 00:05:43.468 position:50% align:center
Why would I do that?

00:05:43.551 --> 00:05:46.012 position:50% align:center
Putting it on the ground is how
everyone else always plays it!

00:05:46.096 --> 00:05:47.597 position:50% align:center
[AYAKA]
There's a reason for that!

00:05:47.681 --> 00:05:49.974 position:50% align:center
I don't get why you're trying to
invent a whole new game, here!

00:05:50.058 --> 00:05:51.476 position:50% align:center
[MACHIO] You know,
it might be more interesting

00:05:51.559 --> 00:05:52.894 position:50% align:center
if I try to squeeze
it between two abs.

00:05:52.977 --> 00:05:54.688 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI] That doesn't help,
it's still weird!

00:05:54.771 --> 00:05:56.940 position:50% align:center
Fun fact. Your traps
play an important part

00:05:57.023 --> 00:05:58.650 position:50% align:center
in the way your body is shaped.

00:05:58.733 --> 00:06:00.735 position:50% align:center
For instance, if they're
weak, you'll end up

00:06:00.819 --> 00:06:02.737 position:50% align:center
involuntarily slouching
without that shoulder support.

00:06:02.821 --> 00:06:04.656 position:50% align:center
Great! And you don't have
to explain beyond that!

00:06:04.739 --> 00:06:05.865 position:50% align:center
Enjoy your vacay!

00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:07.325 position:50% align:center
Make them a part of
your regular routine!

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:09.703 position:50% align:center
It'll help reduce a lot of
stiffness in your shoulders!

00:06:09.786 --> 00:06:12.372 position:50% align:center
Oh wait, I do need to hear this!
Please feel free to continue!

00:06:12.455 --> 00:06:13.873 position:50% align:center
All right! Let's take a look

00:06:13.957 --> 00:06:16.459 position:50% align:center
at an exercise that's perfect
for building the traps!

00:06:16.543 --> 00:06:19.129 position:50% align:center
But wait. I wanna smash this.

00:06:19.212 --> 00:06:24.384 position:50% align:center
[MACHIO] ♪ Machi-oh-ohs
Muscle Lesson of the day! ♪

00:06:24.467 --> 00:06:25.969 position:50% align:center
When you're looking for
a quick and easy way

00:06:26.052 --> 00:06:28.638 position:50% align:center
to bulk up those traps,
I recommend shoulder shrugs!

00:06:28.722 --> 00:06:31.099 position:50% align:center
This movement is simple
enough to do at home.

00:06:31.182 --> 00:06:33.977 position:50% align:center
And should be a staple if you
experience shoulder pain!

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:35.979 position:50% align:center
First, make sure you're
standing with your feet

00:06:36.062 --> 00:06:37.313 position:50% align:center
shoulder width apart.

00:06:37.397 --> 00:06:39.232 position:50% align:center
Face the back of your
hand away from your body.

00:06:39.315 --> 00:06:41.526 position:50% align:center
Shrug and hold and then
lower your shoulders.

00:06:41.609 --> 00:06:44.529 position:50% align:center
Repeat this motion in a steady
rhythm. Take notice of how

00:06:44.612 --> 00:06:47.449 position:50% align:center
your traps are contracting
with every shrug.

00:06:47.532 --> 00:06:50.243 position:50% align:center
You can also do this exercise
with a barbell if you prefer.

00:06:50.326 --> 00:06:52.328 position:50% align:center
Use it the same way
as a dumbbell.

00:06:52.412 --> 00:06:53.997 position:50% align:center
Regardless of which
one you choose,

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:56.624 position:50% align:center
it's important to use proper
form and tighten that core

00:06:56.708 --> 00:06:58.251 position:50% align:center
for maximum support.

00:06:58.335 --> 00:07:01.838 position:50% align:center
Many people find that their grip
wears out before their traps do.

00:07:01.921 --> 00:07:05.592 position:50% align:center
If this happens to you, I
recommend trying a wrist strap.

00:07:05.675 --> 00:07:07.761 position:50% align:center
If you're experiencing
regular shoulder pain,

00:07:07.844 --> 00:07:10.263 position:50% align:center
add these shrugs to your back
and shoulder day workouts.

00:07:10.347 --> 00:07:13.975 position:50% align:center
If you can follow that with
a massage, you're golden!

00:07:14.059 --> 00:07:16.269 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI gasps]
An exercise for pain!

00:07:16.353 --> 00:07:18.563 position:50% align:center
I'm doing these as
soon as we get back!

00:07:18.646 --> 00:07:21.399 position:50% align:center
So, I'm still carrying
this melon around.

00:07:21.483 --> 00:07:23.443 position:50% align:center
[MACHIO] People with desk
jobs need these the most.

00:07:23.526 --> 00:07:25.403 position:50% align:center
They're way more
susceptible to stiffness.

00:07:25.487 --> 00:07:27.781 position:50% align:center
Plus, look how much fun
working your traps can be!

00:07:27.864 --> 00:07:29.699 position:50% align:center
[AYAKA] He's juggling it
with his neck trunk!

00:07:29.783 --> 00:07:30.700 position:50% align:center
That's so awesome!

00:07:30.784 --> 00:07:32.994 position:50% align:center
[CROWD cheering]

00:07:33.078 --> 00:07:34.329 position:50% align:center
[RECEPTIONIST]
Thank you for your patience!

00:07:34.412 --> 00:07:36.122 position:50% align:center
If you're ready,
we'll go ahead and start

00:07:36.206 --> 00:07:38.166 position:50% align:center
our Mr. Nikunoshima contest!

00:07:38.249 --> 00:07:41.211 position:50% align:center
Heh! Let's go get a good seat
and watch this pec parade!

00:07:41.294 --> 00:07:42.212 position:50% align:center
Big muscles!

00:07:42.295 --> 00:07:44.089 position:50% align:center
Well, that was
the original plan.

00:07:44.172 --> 00:07:46.299 position:50% align:center
But since we didn't have
enough qualified applicants,

00:07:46.383 --> 00:07:50.970 position:50% align:center
we had no choice but to cancel
this portion of the competition.

00:07:51.054 --> 00:07:53.431 position:50% align:center
However, the Miss
Nikunoshima contest

00:07:53.515 --> 00:07:55.016 position:50% align:center
isn't lacking in participants.

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:57.352 position:50% align:center
And we're currently still
accepting walk-ins!

00:07:57.435 --> 00:07:59.104 position:50% align:center
But... man... pecs.

00:07:59.187 --> 00:08:00.605 position:50% align:center
Where they at?

00:08:00.689 --> 00:08:02.315 position:50% align:center
Not even gonna try
to play it cool?

00:08:02.399 --> 00:08:05.360 position:50% align:center
[GINA] What's kind of contest
is it? Might be fun to enter!

00:08:05.443 --> 00:08:06.945 position:50% align:center
First prize is really special.

00:08:07.028 --> 00:08:10.073 position:50% align:center
A Nikunoshima protein set!
Isn't that awesome?

00:08:10.156 --> 00:08:11.241 position:50% align:center
And guess what else?

00:08:11.324 --> 00:08:13.827 position:50% align:center
A bonus prize of a
40-hour Blu-ray box set

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:16.538 position:50% align:center
featuring footage from the last
ten years of the competition!

00:08:16.621 --> 00:08:18.456 position:50% align:center
History in the palm
of your hand!

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:20.625 position:50% align:center
Who'd wanna compete
for that heap of crap?

00:08:20.709 --> 00:08:22.127 position:50% align:center
Protein.

00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:26.131 position:50% align:center
Forty hours of Mr. Nikunoshima
on my DVD player.

00:08:26.214 --> 00:08:28.717 position:50% align:center
Heh! It seems I have no choice

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:30.635 position:50% align:center
but to enter this
competition myself.

00:08:30.719 --> 00:08:33.096 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI, AYAKA] Who took over
your character design?

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:35.432 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
Here we are at our final climax!

00:08:35.515 --> 00:08:39.394 position:50% align:center
We've grown so much together,
don't you think?

00:08:39.978 --> 00:08:44.357 position:50% align:center
[PARTICIPANT] I'm number 13!
And this is my I-balance pose!

00:08:44.441 --> 00:08:46.401 position:50% align:center
[CROWD chattering]

00:08:46.484 --> 00:08:48.319 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
Time for the talent section.

00:08:48.403 --> 00:08:50.071 position:50% align:center
[AYAKA]
Mad skills happening there.

00:08:50.155 --> 00:08:52.991 position:50% align:center
Hey Hibiki, I got your prop
ready and prepped for ya.

00:08:53.074 --> 00:08:54.200 position:50% align:center
Thanks, bro!

00:08:54.284 --> 00:08:56.286 position:50% align:center
[MACHIO] Are you sure
you want to do that?

00:08:56.369 --> 00:08:58.121 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI] The key is to show
what you're best at,

00:08:58.204 --> 00:08:59.873 position:50% align:center
and since you're an
arm-wrestling champ,

00:08:59.956 --> 00:09:01.833 position:50% align:center
seems like you'd
want to show off that?

00:09:01.916 --> 00:09:05.128 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but I can't exactly
wrestle myself, can I?

00:09:05.211 --> 00:09:06.588 position:50% align:center
I'd trust her this time.

00:09:06.671 --> 00:09:08.340 position:50% align:center
I actually think it's
the right move.

00:09:08.423 --> 00:09:11.176 position:50% align:center
[chuckles] Wait till
they see me.

00:09:11.259 --> 00:09:13.386 position:50% align:center
You sure are confident
about this one.

00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:16.765 position:50% align:center
Why wouldn't I be? I'm already
certain I'm going to win.

00:09:16.848 --> 00:09:18.725 position:50% align:center
Are you using a secret strategy?

00:09:18.808 --> 00:09:20.018 position:50% align:center
Secret strategy?

00:09:20.101 --> 00:09:21.519 position:50% align:center
I guess.

00:09:21.603 --> 00:09:23.438 position:50% align:center
But it's not really a secret if
I'm performing a technique

00:09:23.521 --> 00:09:25.065 position:50% align:center
only I know how to do, right?

00:09:25.148 --> 00:09:27.609 position:50% align:center
So there's no way I could
lose if I wanted to!

00:09:27.692 --> 00:09:30.362 position:50% align:center
Welcome our next
contestant, number 19.

00:09:30.445 --> 00:09:33.323 position:50% align:center
Lovely! She's an exchange
student here from Russia!

00:09:33.406 --> 00:09:34.949 position:50% align:center
This is Crystal Garson!

00:09:35.033 --> 00:09:37.118 position:50% align:center
I'll perform the Cossacks
Dance for you!

00:09:37.202 --> 00:09:39.788 position:50% align:center
Oh, no! She stole my entry!

00:09:40.789 --> 00:09:42.624 position:50% align:center
[RECEPTIONIST] Let's give her
a round of applause!

00:09:42.707 --> 00:09:46.127 position:50% align:center
That was contestant number
26, Miss Gina Boyd!

00:09:46.211 --> 00:09:47.629 position:50% align:center
Nice work!

00:09:47.712 --> 00:09:48.880 position:50% align:center
[TACHIBANA]
Oh...

00:09:48.963 --> 00:09:51.007 position:50% align:center
Doesn't look like that
went very well for her.

00:09:51.091 --> 00:09:53.385 position:50% align:center
Only 'cause the other
Russian chick did it better.

00:09:53.468 --> 00:09:55.762 position:50% align:center
Man, that's gotta
be a rough burn.

00:09:55.845 --> 00:09:59.015 position:50% align:center
I feel for her.
She has so much potential.

00:09:59.099 --> 00:10:01.559 position:50% align:center
I honestly thought Gina would
become the first foreigner

00:10:01.643 --> 00:10:03.103 position:50% align:center
to win the entire competition.

00:10:03.186 --> 00:10:04.604 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
I didn't realize this contest

00:10:04.688 --> 00:10:06.272 position:50% align:center
had such a hardcore following.

00:10:06.356 --> 00:10:08.608 position:50% align:center
Now, let's see who's up next.

00:10:08.692 --> 00:10:11.444 position:50% align:center
According to this,
it's contestant number 27.

00:10:11.528 --> 00:10:14.447 position:50% align:center
She's here from Tokyo,
Ayaka Uehara!

00:10:14.531 --> 00:10:16.241 position:50% align:center
Yeah! That's right!

00:10:16.324 --> 00:10:19.077 position:50% align:center
You show those losers what
Glory Gym girls are made of!

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:20.245 position:50% align:center
What's she gonna do?

00:10:20.328 --> 00:10:21.871 position:50% align:center
She's got so many talents
to choose from!

00:10:21.955 --> 00:10:24.582 position:50% align:center
[NANA] I think she said she was
gonna bust out her Dragon Flags.

00:10:24.666 --> 00:10:25.834 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Wow!

00:10:25.917 --> 00:10:27.502 position:50% align:center
The crowd is gonna lose
their minds over that!

00:10:27.585 --> 00:10:29.379 position:50% align:center
You're gonna crush it, Ayaka!

00:10:29.462 --> 00:10:31.589 position:50% align:center
[laughs] Oh, I have no doubt.

00:10:31.673 --> 00:10:33.675 position:50% align:center
I have a secret
strategy of my own.

00:10:33.758 --> 00:10:34.884 position:50% align:center
Eh?

00:10:34.968 --> 00:10:37.178 position:50% align:center
Seriously? You mean
besides the Dragon Flag?

00:10:37.262 --> 00:10:40.223 position:50% align:center
Right! I'll give
them Dragon Flags.

00:10:40.306 --> 00:10:41.391 position:50% align:center
And the fire!

00:10:41.474 --> 00:10:42.809 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
Have you lost your mind?!

00:10:42.892 --> 00:10:45.729 position:50% align:center
You'll probably get disqualified
if you go out like that!

00:10:45.812 --> 00:10:48.106 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] Oh, there was
no 'probably' about it.

00:10:48.189 --> 00:10:50.900 position:50% align:center
Up next, welcome to
the stage, number 28.

00:10:50.984 --> 00:10:54.487 position:50% align:center
This is Miss Akemi Soryuin,
also from Tokyo!

00:10:54.571 --> 00:10:57.365 position:50% align:center
Go Akemi! We love you!

00:10:57.449 --> 00:11:01.244 position:50% align:center
All right. Now's your
chance to shine.

00:11:01.327 --> 00:11:02.829 position:50% align:center
[RECEPTIONIST]
I'm excited about this one!

00:11:02.912 --> 00:11:06.541 position:50% align:center
Everyone's been whispering about
that amazing talent of yours!

00:11:06.624 --> 00:11:07.625 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:11:07.709 --> 00:11:08.710 position:50% align:center
[CROWD murmuring]

00:11:08.793 --> 00:11:09.627 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:09.711 --> 00:11:11.087 position:50% align:center
I can't believe what I'm seeing!

00:11:11.171 --> 00:11:12.756 position:50% align:center
That handstand is incredible!

00:11:12.839 --> 00:11:15.216 position:50% align:center
Omigosh, she's not
even swaying at all!

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:18.970 position:50% align:center
Keep watching. You haven't
even seen the best part.

00:11:19.054 --> 00:11:21.598 position:50% align:center
Oh, wait, there's more!

00:11:21.681 --> 00:11:22.849 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:11:22.932 --> 00:11:25.727 position:50% align:center
[RECEPTIONIST]
She's doing handstand pushups!

00:11:27.479 --> 00:11:28.897 position:50% align:center
No frikkin way!

00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:31.232 position:50% align:center
I've only ever seen that done
in sports movies before!

00:11:31.316 --> 00:11:32.901 position:50% align:center
Akemi has always
had a phenomenal

00:11:32.984 --> 00:11:34.944 position:50% align:center
amount of physical
strength for her size.

00:11:35.028 --> 00:11:36.905 position:50% align:center
So, while we're on the subject,

00:11:36.988 --> 00:11:39.491 position:50% align:center
let's discuss how to
do a proper pushup!

00:11:39.574 --> 00:11:40.909 position:50% align:center
The pushup is classic.

00:11:40.992 --> 00:11:43.119 position:50% align:center
It utilizes your own body
weight for resistance.

00:11:43.203 --> 00:11:44.371 position:50% align:center
Even if you've never done it,

00:11:44.454 --> 00:11:46.122 position:50% align:center
most everyone has
at least seen one.

00:11:46.206 --> 00:11:48.083 position:50% align:center
How'd Ayaka get change so fast?

00:11:48.166 --> 00:11:50.627 position:50% align:center
[MACHIO] The target areas for
pushups are the chest area,

00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:53.463 position:50% align:center
and primarily the triceps
section of the arm.

00:11:53.546 --> 00:11:54.839 position:50% align:center
Keep your hands closer together

00:11:54.923 --> 00:11:56.966 position:50% align:center
if you want to target
your triceps more.

00:11:57.050 --> 00:11:59.135 position:50% align:center
Spread them further apart
if you want the focus

00:11:59.219 --> 00:12:00.887 position:50% align:center
to go toward your chest.

00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:04.599 position:50% align:center
You can adjust the distance as
you get closer to your goals.

00:12:04.683 --> 00:12:06.059 position:50% align:center
Slowly bend your elbows

00:12:06.142 --> 00:12:08.603 position:50% align:center
and lower your body down to
a hover above the ground.

00:12:08.687 --> 00:12:11.564 position:50% align:center
Be careful not to lift or lower
your hips as you drop.

00:12:11.648 --> 00:12:13.108 position:50% align:center
Keep your body
in a straight line

00:12:13.191 --> 00:12:15.360 position:50% align:center
and straighten your
elbows to lift you up.

00:12:15.443 --> 00:12:17.696 position:50% align:center
Start with three sets
of 20, if you can.

00:12:17.779 --> 00:12:20.323 position:50% align:center
But remember, the number
of these particular style

00:12:20.407 --> 00:12:21.574 position:50% align:center
of pushups is not as important

00:12:21.658 --> 00:12:24.160 position:50% align:center
as doing them
with precise form.

00:12:24.244 --> 00:12:26.287 position:50% align:center
If you've ever seen someone
doing speed pushups,

00:12:26.371 --> 00:12:29.374 position:50% align:center
these are half as effective,
so I wouldn't recommend them.

00:12:29.457 --> 00:12:31.584 position:50% align:center
You can complete more reps,
but chances of injury

00:12:31.668 --> 00:12:33.628 position:50% align:center
are higher with the
jerking movement.

00:12:33.712 --> 00:12:36.631 position:50% align:center
As for the handstand pushups
Akemi is slaying right now,

00:12:36.715 --> 00:12:39.759 position:50% align:center
those will stimulate your traps
as well as your chest and arms.

00:12:39.843 --> 00:12:42.262 position:50% align:center
Of course, these are a lot more
challenging and you should wait

00:12:42.345 --> 00:12:44.639 position:50% align:center
until you've built up your
strength doing standard pushups

00:12:44.723 --> 00:12:48.601 position:50% align:center
and other traps exercises before
giving this one a whirl.

00:12:48.685 --> 00:12:50.812 position:50% align:center
There are several varieties
of pushups to accommodate

00:12:50.895 --> 00:12:52.230 position:50% align:center
any fitness level and give you

00:12:52.313 --> 00:12:54.858 position:50% align:center
the sculpted upper
body you desire!

00:12:54.941 --> 00:12:58.028 position:50% align:center
[CROWD cheers]

00:12:58.111 --> 00:12:59.487 position:50% align:center
Yes she did!

00:12:59.571 --> 00:13:02.782 position:50% align:center
[AINA] Oh, she's got this
in the bag. Easy!

00:13:02.866 --> 00:13:06.286 position:50% align:center
We still haven't seen what
Miss Sakura's been preparing.

00:13:06.369 --> 00:13:07.704 position:50% align:center
Are you kidding?

00:13:07.787 --> 00:13:09.789 position:50% align:center
You may as well grab that
protein set and the DVDs.

00:13:09.873 --> 00:13:12.542 position:50% align:center
<i>Horosho!</i> I had no idea
you were so strong!

00:13:12.625 --> 00:13:14.127 position:50% align:center
You're all so sweet!

00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:16.421 position:50% align:center
[RECEPTIONIST] All right, and
now for our final participant!

00:13:16.504 --> 00:13:18.465 position:50% align:center
Welcome contestant number 29!

00:13:18.548 --> 00:13:21.509 position:50% align:center
Another from Tokyo,
Hibiki Sakura!

00:13:21.593 --> 00:13:22.385 position:50% align:center
Right!

00:13:22.469 --> 00:13:24.262 position:50% align:center
Go girl! You got this!

00:13:24.346 --> 00:13:26.639 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
Ugh. I'm so nervous!

00:13:26.723 --> 00:13:28.224 position:50% align:center
[GINA]
<i>Davai,</i> Hibiki!

00:13:28.308 --> 00:13:29.684 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI]
Come on, Heebs.

00:13:29.768 --> 00:13:32.854 position:50% align:center
Time for you to show us
all what you've got.

00:13:34.105 --> 00:13:36.149 position:50% align:center
--[gasps]
--A punching bag?

00:13:36.232 --> 00:13:38.818 position:50% align:center
I mean she does watch
a lot of boxing movies.

00:13:38.902 --> 00:13:40.195 position:50% align:center
[KURE gasps]

00:13:40.278 --> 00:13:42.322 position:50% align:center
I'm number 29, Hibiki Sakura.

00:13:42.405 --> 00:13:44.783 position:50% align:center
And I'm gonna hit
this bag. Hard.

00:14:01.299 --> 00:14:03.259 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:14:03.343 --> 00:14:05.387 position:50% align:center
[CROWD cheers]

00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:08.306 position:50% align:center
I freakin' knew it! You've got
natural fighting strength

00:14:08.390 --> 00:14:10.558 position:50% align:center
which pisses me off and
makes me so proud of you!

00:14:10.642 --> 00:14:13.395 position:50% align:center
I knew she had that in her from
the second I saw her swing!

00:14:13.478 --> 00:14:14.938 position:50% align:center
Congrats, Heebs.

00:14:15.021 --> 00:14:17.273 position:50% align:center
I can't wait to introduce you
as our gym's next champion!

00:14:17.357 --> 00:14:19.901 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI laughs] I thought
the chunks were gonna fly!

00:14:19.984 --> 00:14:21.653 position:50% align:center
[MACHIO] You absolutely
killed it out there!

00:14:21.736 --> 00:14:23.822 position:50% align:center
[GINA]
<i>Horosho! Ochen horosho!</i>

00:14:23.905 --> 00:14:26.574 position:50% align:center
But I expect nothing
less from my true rival!

00:14:26.658 --> 00:14:28.201 position:50% align:center
You blew everyone away!

00:14:28.284 --> 00:14:30.286 position:50% align:center
What an amazing
hidden talent you have!

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:32.706 position:50% align:center
Well, I wasn't exactly
hiding it, ya know?

00:14:32.789 --> 00:14:34.791 position:50% align:center
I just never had
a chance to use it.

00:14:34.874 --> 00:14:36.376 position:50% align:center
All right, the judges
have placed their votes

00:14:36.459 --> 00:14:37.711 position:50% align:center
and results are in!

00:14:37.794 --> 00:14:38.795 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS]
Huh?

00:14:38.878 --> 00:14:41.047 position:50% align:center
And, well, looks like
we've got a tie!

00:14:41.131 --> 00:14:44.718 position:50% align:center
Our winners are Akemi Soryuin
and Hibiki Sakura!

00:14:44.801 --> 00:14:46.136 position:50% align:center
According to the official rules,

00:14:46.219 --> 00:14:48.430 position:50% align:center
these two ladies will now
face off in a final round.

00:14:48.513 --> 00:14:49.347 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
What?

00:14:49.431 --> 00:14:50.932 position:50% align:center
--Another round?
--Heck yeah, go!

00:14:51.016 --> 00:14:52.308 position:50% align:center
How so exciting!

00:14:52.392 --> 00:14:53.935 position:50% align:center
Well, this sucks.

00:14:54.019 --> 00:14:55.186 position:50% align:center
I didn't think that
was possible,

00:14:55.270 --> 00:14:56.813 position:50% align:center
so I don't have anything
else prepared.

00:14:56.896 --> 00:14:58.148 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I know.

00:14:58.231 --> 00:15:00.233 position:50% align:center
I wish they would just
pick one and call it day.

00:15:00.316 --> 00:15:01.943 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Perfect, Hibiki!

00:15:02.027 --> 00:15:03.653 position:50% align:center
We'll force them
to do just that!

00:15:03.737 --> 00:15:06.072 position:50% align:center
"That" what?
And how do we do it?

00:15:06.156 --> 00:15:08.158 position:50% align:center
[RECEPTIONIST] Are you ready
to start the final round?

00:15:08.241 --> 00:15:09.743 position:50% align:center
In honor of your request,

00:15:09.826 --> 00:15:12.954 position:50% align:center
you'll both compete in a bench
press battle for the title win!

00:15:13.038 --> 00:15:16.124 position:50% align:center
[MACHIO] First you'll do one
set of 10 reps at 40 kilos,

00:15:16.207 --> 00:15:18.877 position:50% align:center
then we'll add 5 kilos
at a time after each set

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:20.545 position:50% align:center
until someone is maxed out.

00:15:20.628 --> 00:15:22.339 position:50% align:center
Are you both okay
with these parameters?

00:15:22.422 --> 00:15:23.965 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Yes!

00:15:26.885 --> 00:15:28.636 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI]
Let's do the bench press!

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:30.221 position:50% align:center
It was our first
workout together

00:15:30.305 --> 00:15:32.849 position:50% align:center
when we joined
the gym, remember?

00:15:32.932 --> 00:15:34.893 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
Duh! How could I forget?

00:15:34.976 --> 00:15:36.895 position:50% align:center
You're a genius, Akemi.

00:15:36.978 --> 00:15:40.857 position:50% align:center
And yes, this is the perfect
way to determine the winner!

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:42.108 position:50% align:center
Back when we first met,

00:15:42.192 --> 00:15:44.402 position:50% align:center
I was dying trying
to lift just 20 kilos.

00:15:44.486 --> 00:15:45.820 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI]
And look at you now.

00:15:45.904 --> 00:15:49.074 position:50% align:center
You're starting with 40.
Just like I did at that time.

00:15:49.157 --> 00:15:51.409 position:50% align:center
You've grown into such
a strong competitor.

00:15:51.493 --> 00:15:53.703 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI] And that's the strength
I'm fighting with today!

00:15:53.787 --> 00:15:55.997 position:50% align:center
Don't expect me
to go easy on you!

00:15:56.081 --> 00:15:58.291 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI] You are beyond
worthy as my opponent!

00:15:58.375 --> 00:16:00.001 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
I'm gonna take you down, girl!

00:16:00.085 --> 00:16:01.127 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI]
I'm ready!

00:16:01.211 --> 00:16:02.253 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
So am I!

00:16:02.337 --> 00:16:05.674 position:50% align:center
Let's do this!
Ready, set, and go!

00:16:22.816 --> 00:16:24.651 position:50% align:center
One... Two...

00:16:24.734 --> 00:16:27.487 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI] It's finally
happened for us, Hibiki.

00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:30.699 position:50% align:center
There's no way we would've been
able to do this in the past,

00:16:30.782 --> 00:16:34.119 position:50% align:center
not with the relay
or even arm wrestling.

00:16:34.202 --> 00:16:36.621 position:50% align:center
But because of all
your hard work,

00:16:36.705 --> 00:16:40.291 position:50% align:center
I can finally compete
against you one-on-one!

00:16:40.375 --> 00:16:44.295 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI]
Seven... Eight...

00:16:44.379 --> 00:16:46.339 position:50% align:center
Nine...

00:16:46.423 --> 00:16:48.049 position:50% align:center
Ten!

00:16:48.133 --> 00:16:51.261 position:50% align:center
[panting]

00:16:51.344 --> 00:16:53.680 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI sighs]

00:16:53.763 --> 00:16:55.390 position:50% align:center
It's been a while
since I've eaten

00:16:55.473 --> 00:16:57.684 position:50% align:center
and my body's on
a hunger strike.

00:16:57.767 --> 00:16:59.602 position:50% align:center
We end it with Akemi at ten,

00:16:59.686 --> 00:17:03.648 position:50% align:center
Hibiki zero! The winner
is Akemi Soryuin!

00:17:07.819 --> 00:17:09.320 position:50% align:center
[stomach growling]

00:17:09.404 --> 00:17:13.616 position:50% align:center
I'm starving. So hungry.

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:17.120 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI]
What the crap?!

00:17:19.914 --> 00:17:23.710 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile, in the
middle of... elsewhere...

00:17:27.172 --> 00:17:30.800 position:50% align:center
Jason. I, uh... I'm sorry.

00:17:30.884 --> 00:17:33.970 position:50% align:center
[laughs] Foolish friend,

00:17:34.054 --> 00:17:36.306 position:50% align:center
there is no reason
for you to apologize.

00:17:36.389 --> 00:17:38.641 position:50% align:center
[KUTARO] I ruined the
plan to beat our cast

00:17:38.725 --> 00:17:41.394 position:50% align:center
to Nikunoshima and
set up a camera.

00:17:41.478 --> 00:17:46.024 position:50% align:center
And then our boat broke down,
adrift, so lost and so cold.

00:17:46.107 --> 00:17:48.234 position:50% align:center
You'd agreed to be my partner.

00:17:48.318 --> 00:17:52.447 position:50% align:center
And I repay you by turning
our dreams to pond scum.

00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:56.117 position:50% align:center
What you need to know,
is that I...

00:17:56.201 --> 00:17:59.829 position:50% align:center
I've enjoyed this time with you.

00:17:59.913 --> 00:18:02.665 position:50% align:center
[KUTARO]
Huh?

00:18:02.749 --> 00:18:04.376 position:50% align:center
Jason...?

00:18:09.214 --> 00:18:11.174 position:50% align:center
Jason?

00:18:14.803 --> 00:18:18.556 position:50% align:center
[KUTARO]
I'll never let go...

00:19:56.404 --> 00:19:58.031 position:50% align:center
So disappointing.

00:19:58.114 --> 00:20:02.452 position:50% align:center
I thought we were finally going
to have a fair fight together.

00:20:02.535 --> 00:20:04.412 position:50% align:center
We're still talking about that?

00:20:04.496 --> 00:20:06.748 position:50% align:center
That was like totally fair.

00:20:06.831 --> 00:20:08.458 position:50% align:center
And you won, so be happy!

00:20:08.541 --> 00:20:10.835 position:50% align:center
I can't. If you
weren't so hungry,

00:20:10.919 --> 00:20:13.713 position:50% align:center
you would've had the strength
to compete and beat me.

00:20:13.797 --> 00:20:16.132 position:50% align:center
Doesn't that bother you at all?

00:20:17.884 --> 00:20:21.054 position:50% align:center
Sure don't! I had such a
great time with you today!

00:20:31.731 --> 00:20:33.566 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:20:34.859 --> 00:20:36.027 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
If you hadn't pressured me

00:20:36.111 --> 00:20:37.570 position:50% align:center
into joining the gym last year,

00:20:37.654 --> 00:20:40.699 position:50% align:center
I never would've known I had
anything worthy of that contest,

00:20:40.782 --> 00:20:42.534 position:50% align:center
or that lifting could be fun!

00:20:42.617 --> 00:20:43.702 position:50% align:center
And I wouldn't be here with you

00:20:43.785 --> 00:20:46.413 position:50% align:center
checking out these
magical stars.

00:20:46.496 --> 00:20:48.039 position:50% align:center
So when I think
about it like that,

00:20:48.123 --> 00:20:52.419 position:50% align:center
losing doesn't cross my mind.
Because I've won so much more.

00:20:52.502 --> 00:20:54.129 position:50% align:center
Do you mean that?

00:20:54.212 --> 00:20:55.463 position:50% align:center
Yeah, kinda?

00:20:55.547 --> 00:20:58.633 position:50% align:center
But I didn't mean to bust
out the awkward cheese!

00:20:58.717 --> 00:21:00.093 position:50% align:center
Oh, stop it.

00:21:00.176 --> 00:21:02.846 position:50% align:center
If I hadn't joined, I wouldn't
have made friends.

00:21:02.929 --> 00:21:05.140 position:50% align:center
Not real friends like you,
Ayaka, and Gina.

00:21:05.223 --> 00:21:08.476 position:50% align:center
You're all like family to me.

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:11.187 position:50% align:center
My life changed
the moment I met you.

00:21:11.271 --> 00:21:13.314 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:13.398 --> 00:21:16.443 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI] Please say we'll
stay friends, Hibiki. Always?

00:21:16.526 --> 00:21:19.154 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
Well, duh! Right back atcha!

00:21:19.237 --> 00:21:22.240 position:50% align:center
[BOTH laugh]

00:21:22.323 --> 00:21:23.783 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Uh?

00:21:23.867 --> 00:21:24.701 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI]
Huh?!

00:21:24.784 --> 00:21:26.578 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI grunts]
What's that?

00:21:29.122 --> 00:21:31.249 position:50% align:center
--Huh?!
--Whoa!

00:21:31.332 --> 00:21:34.127 position:50% align:center
[BARNOLD] I said I'll be back,
and here I am.

00:21:34.210 --> 00:21:36.546 position:50% align:center
For you, Japanese geisha girls.

00:21:36.629 --> 00:21:37.630 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
Barnie?

00:21:37.714 --> 00:21:39.549 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI]
It's the director and Jason!

00:21:39.632 --> 00:21:40.967 position:50% align:center
What happened to them?

00:21:41.051 --> 00:21:42.677 position:50% align:center
It was around a week ago.

00:21:42.761 --> 00:21:45.472 position:50% align:center
I received an SOS from an
app on Jason's smart phone.

00:21:45.555 --> 00:21:47.640 position:50% align:center
So, I came to rescue
them, naturally.

00:21:47.724 --> 00:21:49.934 position:50% align:center
Someone should call a medic.

00:21:50.018 --> 00:21:52.979 position:50% align:center
I thought I sensed muscle
power! It was you!

00:21:53.063 --> 00:21:54.689 position:50% align:center
Uh! It's Barnie!

00:21:54.773 --> 00:21:56.691 position:50% align:center
[TACHIBANA]
Hibiki! What's going on?

00:21:56.775 --> 00:21:58.526 position:50% align:center
Well, it's a long story.

00:21:58.610 --> 00:22:01.029 position:50% align:center
First they did this and
that and yadda yadda.

00:22:01.112 --> 00:22:02.113 position:50% align:center
[GINA]
There was an accident?

00:22:02.197 --> 00:22:03.782 position:50% align:center
[NANA]
And Barnie came to rescue them?

00:22:03.865 --> 00:22:05.658 position:50% align:center
[AINA] Whoa, how'd you get
that from yadda yadda?

00:22:05.742 --> 00:22:07.911 position:50% align:center
[KURE] If you continue
with your strength training,

00:22:07.994 --> 00:22:09.954 position:50% align:center
you'll understand
everything in time.

00:22:10.038 --> 00:22:11.915 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI] You see that
constellation, Hibiki?

00:22:11.998 --> 00:22:13.500 position:50% align:center
It's the Pectoralis Major!

00:22:13.583 --> 00:22:16.044 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI] Why are you
ruining stars for me?!

00:22:17.337 --> 00:22:19.381 position:50% align:center
It's our last session!
You ready?

00:22:19.464 --> 00:22:22.050 position:50% align:center
Today we're going to focus
on the most basic exercise

00:22:22.133 --> 00:22:24.511 position:50% align:center
in bodyweight training,
the pushup!

00:22:24.594 --> 00:22:26.096 position:50% align:center
Like we mentioned earlier,

00:22:26.179 --> 00:22:28.932 position:50% align:center
choose the variation that
best aligns with your goals!

00:22:29.015 --> 00:22:30.350 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI] When you want
to target your arms,

00:22:30.433 --> 00:22:32.060 position:50% align:center
move your hands closer together.

00:22:32.143 --> 00:22:35.188 position:50% align:center
And spread them wider apart
to focus on your chest.

00:22:35.271 --> 00:22:36.981 position:50% align:center
Do these for 20
complete seconds.

00:22:37.065 --> 00:22:38.733 position:50% align:center
You can drop to your
knees at any time

00:22:38.817 --> 00:22:40.110 position:50% align:center
if this becomes too difficult.

00:22:40.193 --> 00:22:42.362 position:50% align:center
If you're trying to increase
your number of reps,

00:22:42.445 --> 00:22:44.447 position:50% align:center
you can speed up your tempo.

00:22:44.531 --> 00:22:46.741 position:50% align:center
But don't go too fast
and jerk yourself around.

00:22:46.825 --> 00:22:49.703 position:50% align:center
The most important thing is
to maintain posture and form.

00:22:49.786 --> 00:22:51.788 position:50% align:center
No man on this
earth is an island!

00:22:51.871 --> 00:22:54.124 position:50% align:center
And no one can live
without healthy muscles!

00:22:54.207 --> 00:22:55.375 position:50% align:center
Whenever you work out,

00:22:55.458 --> 00:22:57.794 position:50% align:center
thank your muscles for
getting you through it!

00:22:57.877 --> 00:22:59.004 position:50% align:center
Are we all set?

00:22:59.087 --> 00:23:01.589 position:50% align:center
Twenty seconds on
the clock. And go!

00:23:01.673 --> 00:23:03.842 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
Inhale as you drop down, and...

00:23:03.925 --> 00:23:05.635 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI]
...exhale as you push up.

00:23:05.719 --> 00:23:08.013 position:50% align:center
This should give you
a little boost.

00:23:08.096 --> 00:23:11.599 position:50% align:center
[GINA] Be sure not to overdo it!
You don't want to tear anything!

00:23:11.683 --> 00:23:13.601 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI]
Appreciate your chest muscles!

00:23:13.685 --> 00:23:15.812 position:50% align:center
Lower your head and
body all the way down!

00:23:15.895 --> 00:23:18.106 position:50% align:center
[AYAKA] Don't forget, you can
drop to your knees at any time!

00:23:18.189 --> 00:23:19.858 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI] Be grateful for
your body and muscles

00:23:19.941 --> 00:23:22.485 position:50% align:center
[GINA]
Keep going! <i>Spasibo!</i>

00:23:22.569 --> 00:23:23.695 position:50% align:center
[TACHIBANA]
You're done!

00:23:23.778 --> 00:23:26.072 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Nice bulk, you crushed it!

00:23:26.156 --> 00:23:27.991 position:50% align:center
Eating clean and
exercising regularly

00:23:28.074 --> 00:23:30.410 position:50% align:center
are the best ways to show
your body gratitude!

00:23:30.493 --> 00:23:32.078 position:50% align:center
We did it, you guys!

00:23:32.162 --> 00:23:35.248 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Okay, bye!

00:23:42.172 --> 00:23:43.923 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:23:44.007 --> 00:23:47.218 position:50% align:center
[laughs, squeals]
