Summer is already half over,

00:00:15.473 --> 00:00:19.519 position:50% align:center
and Hibiki, as single as ever,
is back at the gym.

00:00:19.602 --> 00:00:21.396 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI] Since I crushed
my back yesterday,

00:00:21.479 --> 00:00:23.398 position:50% align:center
I'll work on my chest today.

00:00:23.481 --> 00:00:26.109 position:50% align:center
'Cause I'm a hardcore
gym rat now, baby!

00:00:26.192 --> 00:00:28.862 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] Keep in mind, when
you're doing dynamic stretches,

00:00:28.945 --> 00:00:32.157 position:50% align:center
it's important to be aware
of your surroundings.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:33.241 position:50% align:center

It's Akemi.

[screaming]

00:00:41.291 --> 00:00:43.960 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI] What are all these
people doing here?!

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:27.188 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] Gyms have what
are known as "peak hours."

00:02:27.272 --> 00:02:31.276 position:50% align:center
Here's a handy little example,
if you like charts.

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:34.154 position:50% align:center
But what you're seeing now
is another beast entirely.

00:02:34.237 --> 00:02:36.531 position:50% align:center
The phenomenon known
as "summer vacation."

00:02:36.614 --> 00:02:39.242 position:50% align:center
Some people think, "I'm gonna
get ripped over summer break

00:02:39.325 --> 00:02:42.579 position:50% align:center
for sure!" Others pretend
they're going to exercise,

00:02:42.662 --> 00:02:44.914 position:50% align:center
but just hang out
for the cool AC.

00:02:44.998 --> 00:02:46.958 position:50% align:center
And of course there are
those who're scouting

00:02:47.042 --> 00:02:49.419 position:50% align:center
for a sweet summer fling.

00:02:49.502 --> 00:02:51.421 position:50% align:center
For whatever reason,
all of these people

00:02:51.504 --> 00:02:53.882 position:50% align:center
with unrealistic expectations
pile into the gym

00:02:53.965 --> 00:02:55.383 position:50% align:center
at exactly the same time,

00:02:55.467 --> 00:02:56.968 position:50% align:center
transforming the early afternoon

00:02:57.052 --> 00:02:59.721 position:50% align:center
with the power of their
sweaty hivemind.

00:02:59.804 --> 00:03:01.514 position:50% align:center
Surpassing the peakest
of peak hours,

00:03:01.598 --> 00:03:03.933 position:50% align:center
this is known as "Prime Time."

00:03:04.017 --> 00:03:05.518 position:50% align:center
So that's what's up.

00:03:05.602 --> 00:03:08.188 position:50% align:center
It's crazy that you two haven't
been in during primetime before.

00:03:08.271 --> 00:03:11.566 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI] I mean, this is
just crazy in general.

00:03:11.649 --> 00:03:13.651 position:50% align:center
What are we
supposed to do now?

00:03:13.735 --> 00:03:16.071 position:50% align:center
There's a line for the bench
presses and dumbbells,

00:03:16.154 --> 00:03:17.489 position:50% align:center
so that's out.

00:03:17.572 --> 00:03:19.991 position:50% align:center
And we can't do cardio either,
since every single bike

00:03:20.075 --> 00:03:22.118 position:50% align:center
and treadmill is being
used at the moment.

00:03:22.202 --> 00:03:24.537 position:50% align:center
[MACHIO]
Mm... Sorry, ladies.

00:03:24.621 --> 00:03:25.872 position:50% align:center
Not much I can do.

00:03:25.955 --> 00:03:28.625 position:50% align:center
Everyone's here to work out,
just like you are.

00:03:28.708 --> 00:03:31.878 position:50% align:center
And those stations are popular
with vets and newbies alike.

00:03:31.961 --> 00:03:33.463 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI] I'm not about
to fight for a spot

00:03:33.546 --> 00:03:36.091 position:50% align:center
on the power racks, either.

00:03:36.174 --> 00:03:37.634 position:50% align:center
[ALL grunting]

00:03:37.717 --> 00:03:40.679 position:50% align:center
It'd be one thing if the new
members stayed motivated,

00:03:40.762 --> 00:03:43.056 position:50% align:center
but once summer's over,
they'll quit,

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:45.475 position:50% align:center
just like all the cowards
before them.

00:03:45.558 --> 00:03:48.228 position:50% align:center
Makes sense, but what's up
with the lighting?

00:03:48.311 --> 00:03:50.730 position:50% align:center
I was really hoping I could
work on my chest today.

00:03:50.814 --> 00:03:53.692 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that sucks. Do you
wanna go eat our feelings?

00:03:53.775 --> 00:03:54.859 position:50% align:center
[MACHIO]
We have options!

00:03:54.943 --> 00:03:56.444 position:50% align:center
Why don't you give this a try?

00:03:56.528 --> 00:03:57.862 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
Hm?

00:03:57.946 --> 00:04:00.573 position:50% align:center
[MACHIO] There're still plenty
of chest machines open!

00:04:00.657 --> 00:04:04.411 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI] Huh? So it's like
a robo bench press?

00:04:04.494 --> 00:04:07.247 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh! And it'll make
a fine replacement.

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.916 position:50% align:center
I don't know--I've never
used one of these before.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.336 position:50% align:center
Wow. I've been looking up
to a fraud this entire time.

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:14.754 position:50% align:center
It's not like that!

00:04:14.838 --> 00:04:16.506 position:50% align:center
The proper way to
train your chest

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:19.175 position:50% align:center
is with free weights
and free weights only!

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:21.177 position:50% align:center
Machines are a cheater's tool!

00:04:21.261 --> 00:04:22.679 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
Wow, dramatic much?

00:04:22.762 --> 00:04:25.598 position:50% align:center
[laughs] It sounds harsh
when you put it like that,

00:04:25.682 --> 00:04:27.726 position:50% align:center
but a lot of people
do feel that way.

00:04:27.809 --> 00:04:29.394 position:50% align:center
I admit, free weights do offer

00:04:29.477 --> 00:04:31.521 position:50% align:center
more muscle stimulation
than machines.

00:04:31.604 --> 00:04:34.983 position:50% align:center
But you know, machines and
free weights aren't enemies,

00:04:35.066 --> 00:04:36.443 position:50% align:center
they're good friends!

00:04:36.526 --> 00:04:37.777 position:50% align:center

Wait, what?

00:04:37.861 --> 00:04:38.611 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:04:38.695 --> 00:04:40.071 position:50% align:center
Sometimes you do one.

00:04:40.155 --> 00:04:41.656 position:50% align:center
Sometimes the other.

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.743 position:50% align:center
Free weights are your foundation
and machines are your support!

00:04:44.826 --> 00:04:47.454 position:50% align:center
Use both, get ripped.

00:04:47.537 --> 00:04:50.832 position:50% align:center

00:05:05.013 --> 00:05:06.431 position:50% align:center
Let's get our swole on.

00:05:06.514 --> 00:05:09.392 position:50% align:center
First, let me explain some
advantages of the chest machine.

00:05:09.476 --> 00:05:12.479 position:50% align:center
Its proper name is the chest
press machine, by the way.

00:05:12.562 --> 00:05:14.939 position:50% align:center
Even if you're just visiting
a gym to check things out,

00:05:15.023 --> 00:05:17.400 position:50% align:center
be sure to give it a whirl!

00:05:17.484 --> 00:05:20.153 position:50% align:center
While bench presses certainly
work out your chest muscles,

00:05:20.236 --> 00:05:23.281 position:50% align:center
you also end up using a number
of other muscles in the process.

00:05:23.365 --> 00:05:25.867 position:50% align:center
You're putting pressure
on the pectoralis major,

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:28.411 position:50% align:center
the deltoids, and the triceps.

00:05:28.495 --> 00:05:31.247 position:50% align:center
That's a big portion of your
shoulders and upper arms.

00:05:31.331 --> 00:05:34.417 position:50% align:center
In contrast, a chest machine's
fixed path eliminates

00:05:34.501 --> 00:05:36.753 position:50% align:center
the need to keep your balance
during the workout,

00:05:36.836 --> 00:05:39.589 position:50% align:center
freeing up several muscles that
are used in bench presses.

00:05:39.673 --> 00:05:40.924 position:50% align:center
Since you're locked in place,

00:05:41.007 --> 00:05:43.760 position:50% align:center
you're also less likely to
make any errors in form.

00:05:43.843 --> 00:05:45.929 position:50% align:center
The machine is designed
to apply direct pressure

00:05:46.012 --> 00:05:49.015 position:50% align:center
to the chest itself, so it makes
for a laser-focused workout,

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:51.601 position:50% align:center
without any unwanted
strain elsewhere.

00:05:51.685 --> 00:05:53.144 position:50% align:center
Some days you'll want
to use free weights

00:05:53.228 --> 00:05:54.979 position:50% align:center
and other days you'll
want to use machines,

00:05:55.063 --> 00:05:56.606 position:50% align:center

with you two for a while.

00:07:58.144 --> 00:07:58.895 position:50% align:center
Is that cool?

00:07:58.978 --> 00:08:00.230 position:50% align:center
Yes, of course it is!

00:08:00.313 --> 00:08:02.232 position:50% align:center
We got a whole squad now!

00:08:02.315 --> 00:08:03.942 position:50% align:center
This is gonna kick-a!

00:08:04.025 --> 00:08:05.318 position:50% align:center
Dude, you suck.

00:08:05.402 --> 00:08:07.696 position:50% align:center
You didn't tell me your trainer
was such a hottie.

00:08:07.779 --> 00:08:10.365 position:50% align:center
I'd like to curl his dumbbell
if you know what I mean.

00:08:10.448 --> 00:08:13.451 position:50% align:center
Give it like a day.
It gets old fast.

00:08:13.535 --> 00:08:16.121 position:50% align:center
She's kidding.
Don't be rude, Hibiki.

00:08:16.204 --> 00:08:18.123 position:50% align:center
[AYAKA] What, is there
something I'm missing?

00:08:18.206 --> 00:08:19.457 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
You'll have to wait and see!

00:08:19.541 --> 00:08:22.002 position:50% align:center
Great, another student
and she's super fit, too!

00:08:22.085 --> 00:08:23.086 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:08:26.881 --> 00:08:33.013 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI panting]

00:08:33.096 --> 00:08:34.723 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI]
Sorry I kept you waiting!

00:08:34.806 --> 00:08:36.349 position:50% align:center
My bad!

00:08:36.433 --> 00:08:39.644 position:50% align:center
No prob! C'mon, let's go!

00:08:39.728 --> 00:08:41.563 position:50% align:center
This is the first time
we've gone to the gym

00:08:41.646 --> 00:08:42.772 position:50% align:center
with our new squad!

00:08:42.856 --> 00:08:44.733 position:50% align:center
We're all gonna get
swole together!

00:08:44.816 --> 00:08:46.818 position:50% align:center
Still no interest in
looking like a dude.

00:08:46.901 --> 00:08:48.737 position:50% align:center
I say today is
bench press day!

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:51.072 position:50% align:center
And what about you, Hibiki?

00:08:51.156 --> 00:08:53.533 position:50% align:center
I'm workin' them flyes, girl.

00:08:59.914 --> 00:09:01.875 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasping]

00:09:05.295 --> 00:09:06.463 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI]
What are the odds?

00:09:06.546 --> 00:09:09.382 position:50% align:center
Silverman Gym is closed,
the city pool is closed,

00:09:09.466 --> 00:09:11.885 position:50% align:center
and all the local training
centers are shuttered, too.

00:09:11.968 --> 00:09:13.678 position:50% align:center
[AYAKA]
It's a total dumbbell lockdown.

00:09:13.762 --> 00:09:16.264 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
This is literally the worst.

00:09:16.348 --> 00:09:17.807 position:50% align:center
Okay, think.

00:09:17.891 --> 00:09:20.310 position:50% align:center
There's gotta be somewhere we
can still hang out together.

00:09:20.393 --> 00:09:21.561 position:50% align:center
The mall, maybe?

00:09:21.644 --> 00:09:23.313 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Or at my place!

00:09:23.396 --> 00:09:24.856 position:50% align:center
If you'd like!

00:09:24.939 --> 00:09:26.149 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Huh?

00:09:26.983 --> 00:09:29.736 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI, AYAKA
gasping, laughing]

00:09:29.819 --> 00:09:31.654 position:50% align:center
[AYAKA]
Are you, like, Marie Antoinette

00:09:31.738 --> 00:09:33.406 position:50% align:center
and just never told us?

00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:36.326 position:50% align:center
'Cause this is definitely
the palace of Versailles.

00:09:36.409 --> 00:09:37.869 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI]
Is it that fancy?

00:09:37.952 --> 00:09:40.497 position:50% align:center
I've lived here my whole life,
so I never noticed.

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:42.374 position:50% align:center
Just seems normal to me.

00:09:42.457 --> 00:09:45.794 position:50% align:center
[BOTH] "I never even noticed
I lived in a palace!"

00:09:47.212 --> 00:09:49.839 position:50% align:center
My parents retired early,
but they're not home.

00:09:49.923 --> 00:09:52.092 position:50% align:center
They took off, traveling
the whole world!

00:09:52.175 --> 00:09:55.845 position:50% align:center
So, it's only me and my big
sister living here right now.

00:09:55.929 --> 00:09:57.097 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
No way!

00:09:57.180 --> 00:10:00.016 position:50% align:center
So what, do you have,
like, 15 bedrooms each?

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:02.060 position:50% align:center
Is the rest of your family
into weightlifting

00:10:02.143 --> 00:10:05.021 position:50% align:center
as much as you are?
'Cause with a place this huge,

00:10:05.105 --> 00:10:07.524 position:50% align:center
you could have your own
home training center, easy!

00:10:07.607 --> 00:10:09.150 position:50% align:center
That does sound nice.

00:10:09.234 --> 00:10:11.611 position:50% align:center
But I doubt my sister
would approve of that.

00:10:11.695 --> 00:10:13.154 position:50% align:center
She's real picky.

00:10:13.238 --> 00:10:15.865 position:50% align:center
She says if you want to train,
you should do it at the gym.

00:10:15.949 --> 00:10:18.368 position:50% align:center
If you love movies,
you still go to the theater,

00:10:18.451 --> 00:10:20.453 position:50% align:center
even if you could watch
them at home, right?

00:10:20.537 --> 00:10:21.913 position:50% align:center
Sure. I guess so.

00:10:21.996 --> 00:10:24.249 position:50% align:center
That's a solid analogy, yeah.

00:10:24.332 --> 00:10:26.084 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI] There has to be
some kind of workout

00:10:26.167 --> 00:10:27.502 position:50% align:center
we can do here, though.

00:10:27.585 --> 00:10:28.920 position:50% align:center
[AYAKA] If you don't
have any equipment,

00:10:29.004 --> 00:10:31.631 position:50% align:center
we're kind of stuck doing
pushups and squats, right?

00:10:31.715 --> 00:10:33.466 position:50% align:center
I'm always game for
some dragon flags.

00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:35.135 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI] Would you get out
of here with that crap?

00:10:35.218 --> 00:10:37.762 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Oh, I know!

00:10:37.846 --> 00:10:40.682 position:50% align:center
Be right back!

00:10:40.765 --> 00:10:42.892 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Huh?

00:10:42.976 --> 00:10:44.477 position:50% align:center
I found just the thing!

00:10:44.561 --> 00:10:46.563 position:50% align:center
My sister had it hidden!

00:10:46.646 --> 00:10:49.232 position:50% align:center
Here. I haven't been
able to look at it yet,

00:10:49.315 --> 00:10:51.860 position:50% align:center
but it should be full
of stuff we can try!

00:10:51.943 --> 00:10:54.612 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI] You sure?
Looks kind of hardcore.

00:10:54.696 --> 00:10:56.406 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
Let's see...

00:10:56.489 --> 00:11:00.035 position:50% align:center
Says it "targets all exercise
levels from beginner to pro."

00:11:00.118 --> 00:11:02.037 position:50% align:center
So... cool?

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:03.705 position:50% align:center
Okay, I take it back! Not cool!

00:11:03.788 --> 00:11:06.082 position:50% align:center
What is with this creepy dude?

00:11:06.166 --> 00:11:08.543 position:50% align:center
Toshio Ozu. He's a big deal!

00:11:08.626 --> 00:11:12.047 position:50% align:center
Trainers love him!
Let's watch the DVD!

00:11:29.647 --> 00:11:31.524 position:50% align:center
I'm professor of
English Literature

00:11:31.608 --> 00:11:35.320 position:50% align:center
at Koto Women's University.
Toshio Ozu.

00:11:35.403 --> 00:11:37.489 position:50% align:center
I know why you're here.

00:11:37.572 --> 00:11:39.282 position:50% align:center
You don't live close
enough to a gym,

00:11:39.366 --> 00:11:42.786 position:50% align:center
or perhaps you'd rather
not go. Well, worry not.

00:11:42.869 --> 00:11:46.706 position:50% align:center
Fitness need not elude you, even
in the comfort of your own home.

00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:48.917 position:50% align:center
Because I am here
with you always.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.462 position:50% align:center
To gently show you the path to
the body that you so desire.

00:11:52.545 --> 00:11:54.756 position:50% align:center
So let's get to it! Ha!

00:11:54.839 --> 00:11:56.299 position:50% align:center
Oh my gosh, I love it.

00:11:56.383 --> 00:11:58.927 position:50% align:center
You nailed it Akemi, this is
just what we were looking for!

00:11:59.010 --> 00:12:01.304 position:50% align:center
I mean, I guess
this guy is legit.

00:12:01.388 --> 00:12:03.682 position:50% align:center
He's intense, at least.

00:12:08.853 --> 00:12:10.188 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
Eh...

00:12:10.271 --> 00:12:14.275 position:50% align:center
All that buildup, but this
stuff is like super basic.

00:12:14.359 --> 00:12:15.944 position:50% align:center
Looks like there's
no replacement

00:12:16.027 --> 00:12:17.779 position:50% align:center
for a proper gym, huh?

00:12:17.862 --> 00:12:21.241 position:50% align:center
He's a professor, and he still
can't teach us anything cool?

00:12:21.324 --> 00:12:24.411 position:50% align:center
Oh! This one looks kinda fun!

00:12:24.494 --> 00:12:28.373 position:50% align:center
Fine choice! This lesson's
exercise is called a dip!

00:12:28.456 --> 00:12:32.127 position:50% align:center
Okay. Line up two chairs,
just like so.

00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:35.046 position:50% align:center
Then groove your way
right between them.

00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:38.758 position:50% align:center
[grunts] Grab here and lift!

00:12:38.842 --> 00:12:41.261 position:50% align:center
Hold tight and suspend
yourself in the air,

00:12:41.344 --> 00:12:44.723 position:50% align:center
bending your body forward
slightly, like my assistants.

00:12:44.806 --> 00:12:46.725 position:50% align:center
He's got a whole posse now!

00:12:46.808 --> 00:12:50.270 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI] Not only that, one of
them looks awfully familiar!

00:12:50.353 --> 00:12:52.981 position:50% align:center
[OZU] Bend your elbows,
and slowly lower your body

00:12:53.064 --> 00:12:54.607 position:50% align:center
without touching the ground.

00:12:54.691 --> 00:12:57.360 position:50% align:center
This is what's referred to
as a "negative" movement.

00:12:57.444 --> 00:12:59.195 position:50% align:center
Now aim for ten dips.

00:12:59.279 --> 00:13:00.071 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:13:00.155 --> 00:13:04.200 position:50% align:center
[TRAINERS grunting]

00:13:06.411 --> 00:13:08.288 position:50% align:center
I think those guys're clones!

00:13:08.371 --> 00:13:12.542 position:50% align:center
This is like... a bad
trip or something.

00:13:12.625 --> 00:13:14.544 position:50% align:center
[OZU] Be careful not
to rely on momentum

00:13:14.627 --> 00:13:16.504 position:50% align:center
as you raise and
lower your body.

00:13:16.588 --> 00:13:19.299 position:50% align:center
Swinging too much not
only upsets your stability,

00:13:19.382 --> 00:13:22.969 position:50% align:center
it also decreases your
resistance by as much as half.

00:13:23.053 --> 00:13:24.888 position:50% align:center
[OZU grunts]

00:13:24.971 --> 00:13:27.515 position:50% align:center
[OZU] If you can't do
regular dips, never fear.

00:13:27.599 --> 00:13:30.393 position:50% align:center
Simply position your feet
on the floor like so and

00:13:30.477 --> 00:13:32.729 position:50% align:center
place your hands on
the seat of a chair.

00:13:32.812 --> 00:13:35.023 position:50% align:center
This exercise is called
a reverse push-up

00:13:35.106 --> 00:13:37.817 position:50% align:center
and it works out the same areas.

00:13:37.901 --> 00:13:39.986 position:50% align:center
Like the dip, the
negative movement

00:13:40.070 --> 00:13:41.780 position:50% align:center
is especially important.

00:13:41.863 --> 00:13:44.449 position:50% align:center
Focus on lowering your body
as slowly as possible

00:13:44.532 --> 00:13:45.617 position:50% align:center
without easing up.

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:47.911 position:50% align:center
And once again,
don't use your momentum.

00:13:47.994 --> 00:13:50.705 position:50% align:center
Dips are perfect when you
want to work out your chest

00:13:50.789 --> 00:13:52.207 position:50% align:center
and your triceps.

00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:55.543 position:50% align:center
You can do bench presses and
dumbbell presses at the gym,

00:13:55.627 --> 00:13:57.962 position:50% align:center
but if you would rather spend
the day at home for a change,

00:13:58.046 --> 00:14:00.465 position:50% align:center
doing dips or pushups
can be nice.

00:14:00.548 --> 00:14:03.343 position:50% align:center
Ahh... Very nice.

00:14:03.426 --> 00:14:05.929 position:50% align:center
It's important to work out
your body, but don't forget

00:14:06.012 --> 00:14:07.681 position:50% align:center
to work out your mind as well!

00:14:07.764 --> 00:14:11.101 position:50% align:center
A true champion possesses
both brain and brawn!

00:14:11.184 --> 00:14:13.812 position:50% align:center
So aim for the top!
I know you can do it!

00:14:13.895 --> 00:14:16.773 position:50% align:center
Mwah!

00:14:16.856 --> 00:14:20.235 position:50% align:center
Okay. I think I've seen enough
of that face for a lifetime.

00:14:20.318 --> 00:14:22.320 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I've seen
all I need as well.

00:14:22.404 --> 00:14:23.988 position:50% align:center
Now I'm ready to try it!

00:14:24.072 --> 00:14:25.865 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Uh.

00:14:25.949 --> 00:14:26.991 position:50% align:center
[OZU]
Ooh!

00:14:34.499 --> 00:14:35.959 position:50% align:center
Ha! And that's ten!

00:14:36.042 --> 00:14:38.586 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI] You make it look easy,
Ayaka! Your form is so good!

00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:40.505 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI] You learn those
moves at the dojo?

00:14:40.588 --> 00:14:42.048 position:50% align:center
What are you guys
talking about?

00:14:42.132 --> 00:14:45.176 position:50% align:center
You two finished off your
sets just as easily as I did.

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:46.553 position:50% align:center
No surprise from Akemi,

00:14:46.636 --> 00:14:48.847 position:50% align:center
but you've made some
serious gains in no time!

00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:50.682 position:50% align:center
Whoa, you really think so?

00:14:50.765 --> 00:14:53.393 position:50% align:center
Let's do something
tougher than normal dips.

00:14:53.476 --> 00:14:55.562 position:50% align:center
Oh! And this should
be just perfect!

00:14:55.645 --> 00:14:56.813 position:50% align:center
--[HIBIKI gaps]
--[AKEMI laughs]

00:14:58.481 --> 00:15:01.860 position:50% align:center
[AYAKA] It's the same as before,
only with weights.

00:15:01.943 --> 00:15:05.238 position:50% align:center
This guy's creepy, but he
does know some solid tricks!

00:15:05.321 --> 00:15:07.741 position:50% align:center
Sorry, dude, I shouldn't
have doubted you!

00:15:07.824 --> 00:15:10.326 position:50% align:center
Ready? We can use this!

00:15:12.704 --> 00:15:13.580 position:50% align:center
Let's go!

00:15:13.663 --> 00:15:16.332 position:50% align:center
It's time to dunk on gravity!

00:15:18.376 --> 00:15:20.003 position:50% align:center
''Kay! I'm ready!

00:15:20.086 --> 00:15:21.838 position:50% align:center
One.

00:15:22.505 --> 00:15:24.382 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] Before doing dips,
please make sure

00:15:24.466 --> 00:15:27.844 position:50% align:center
your chairs are strong enough
to, um, handle the weight.

00:15:27.927 --> 00:15:30.055 position:50% align:center
Sorry! To you and the chairs!

00:15:30.138 --> 00:15:32.015 position:50% align:center
As soon as I get paid,
I'll pay for it!

00:15:32.098 --> 00:15:35.852 position:50% align:center
No! I'm just glad you're okay!
They're only chairs!

00:15:39.773 --> 00:15:42.901 position:50% align:center
[HOST] My goodness, this is
truly a priceless treasure!

00:15:42.984 --> 00:15:44.736 position:50% align:center
Very few of these still exist.

00:15:44.819 --> 00:15:48.531 position:50% align:center
Even if you paid hundreds of
millions, it would be a steal!

00:15:48.615 --> 00:15:50.408 position:50% align:center
No, it can't be.

00:15:50.492 --> 00:15:52.035 position:50% align:center
Unless those chairs I destroyed

00:15:52.118 --> 00:15:55.455 position:50% align:center
are haunting me from
beyond the grave.

00:15:59.209 --> 00:16:01.461 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
Ah! I can see it!

00:16:02.587 --> 00:16:03.755 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
The ocean!

00:16:04.881 --> 00:16:06.716 position:50% align:center
[ALL laughing]

00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:09.260 position:50% align:center
Look, Miss Tachibana!
We're almost there!

00:16:09.344 --> 00:16:12.138 position:50% align:center
Wow, what do you know.

00:16:12.222 --> 00:16:13.682 position:50% align:center
[TACHIBANA] Just what every
teacher wants on their

00:16:13.765 --> 00:16:16.893 position:50% align:center
summer vacation, hanging out
with their students, again.

00:16:16.976 --> 00:16:18.436 position:50% align:center
I thought going somewhere
further away

00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:21.231 position:50% align:center
would be a safe place to
meet a special someone.

00:16:21.314 --> 00:16:23.358 position:50% align:center
But so far, nope, not so much.

00:16:23.441 --> 00:16:24.693 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
Don't mind if I do!

00:16:24.776 --> 00:16:26.194 position:50% align:center
Me, too!

00:16:26.277 --> 00:16:28.363 position:50% align:center
[TACHIBANA] It's fine,
they'll go do their own thing

00:16:28.446 --> 00:16:30.740 position:50% align:center
once we get to the beach.

00:16:30.824 --> 00:16:32.909 position:50% align:center
What's eatin' you, Akemi?

00:16:32.992 --> 00:16:36.454 position:50% align:center
Well, something's been
bugging me for a while now.

00:16:36.538 --> 00:16:38.707 position:50% align:center
This is supposed to be the
height of swimming season,

00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:41.543 position:50% align:center
right? So why are we the
only people on the bus?

00:16:41.626 --> 00:16:43.128 position:50% align:center
It's kind of weird.

00:16:51.428 --> 00:16:52.804 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasping]

00:16:57.934 --> 00:17:01.021 position:50% align:center
[BOY A] Oh, you didn't hear?
It was on the news.

00:17:01.104 --> 00:17:03.189 position:50% align:center
They saw a whole buttload
of sharks in the water,

00:17:03.273 --> 00:17:06.067 position:50% align:center
so the beach is shut
down till next year.

00:17:14.451 --> 00:17:16.578 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Well, this is balls.

00:17:16.661 --> 00:17:19.789 position:50% align:center
I wanted all the guys to tell me
how hot I am now that I'm fit.

00:17:19.873 --> 00:17:21.708 position:50% align:center
Well, that's a stupid plan.

00:17:21.791 --> 00:17:24.627 position:50% align:center
[TACHIBANA] I mean, it was my
plan, but who's keeping tabs?

00:17:24.711 --> 00:17:26.171 position:50% align:center
[AYAKA]
Look at this ocean.

00:17:26.254 --> 00:17:29.090 position:50% align:center
Omigod, those waves are
singing me to sleep.

00:17:29.174 --> 00:17:31.676 position:50% align:center
But what's the point if we can't
even get close to them?

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:32.802 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
Yay!

00:17:32.886 --> 00:17:34.304 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI laughs]

00:17:34.387 --> 00:17:36.556 position:50% align:center
[AYAKA laughs]

00:17:36.639 --> 00:17:39.309 position:50% align:center
[TACHIBANA]
Why hello, Mr. Abs!

00:17:39.392 --> 00:17:40.935 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI grunts]

00:17:41.978 --> 00:17:43.813 position:50% align:center
[ALL sigh]

00:17:43.897 --> 00:17:47.817 position:50% align:center
It's such a waste. Swimming in
the ocean is a great workout.

00:17:47.901 --> 00:17:49.277 position:50% align:center
[AYAKA, TACHIBANA]
Wow, there it is.

00:17:49.361 --> 00:17:51.488 position:50% align:center
Not even subtle about it either.

00:17:51.571 --> 00:17:55.158 position:50% align:center
[gasps] I know!

00:17:55.241 --> 00:17:57.035 position:50% align:center
If we can't use the ocean,

00:17:57.118 --> 00:17:59.704 position:50% align:center
then we'll just have
to use the beach!

00:18:01.539 --> 00:18:02.999 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI] You've come all
the way to the beach,

00:18:03.083 --> 00:18:05.377 position:50% align:center
but can't set foot in
the water? Don't worry!

00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:07.087 position:50% align:center
I've got the answer for you!

00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:08.421 position:50% align:center
Even if you can't go swimming,

00:18:08.505 --> 00:18:10.382 position:50% align:center
you can still get
a killer workout!

00:18:10.465 --> 00:18:12.050 position:50% align:center
I didn't want to work out.

00:18:12.133 --> 00:18:14.052 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI] The exercise we're
learning today is called

00:18:14.135 --> 00:18:16.513 position:50% align:center
a burpee. It works
out your whole body

00:18:16.596 --> 00:18:18.515 position:50% align:center
and it doesn't even
require equipment.

00:18:18.598 --> 00:18:21.226 position:50% align:center
It's a high-intensity
aerobic exercise,

00:18:21.309 --> 00:18:24.062 position:50% align:center
so it's a great way to burn
fat and improve your cardio

00:18:24.145 --> 00:18:25.397 position:50% align:center
at the same time.

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:28.358 position:50% align:center
First, crouch, placing
both hands on the ground.

00:18:28.441 --> 00:18:30.694 position:50% align:center
Then, stretch your legs
backwards, like so.

00:18:30.777 --> 00:18:33.071 position:50% align:center
And assume a push-up position.

00:18:33.154 --> 00:18:36.241 position:50% align:center
While you're down there, you
can do a pushup if you like.

00:18:36.324 --> 00:18:37.534 position:50% align:center
Then, jump to a crouch

00:18:37.617 --> 00:18:40.286 position:50% align:center
and return to your original
standing position.

00:18:41.663 --> 00:18:44.374 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI] It's more effective
if you jump at this part.

00:18:44.457 --> 00:18:46.418 position:50% align:center
Repeat these movements
as fast as you can

00:18:46.501 --> 00:18:47.961 position:50% align:center
while maintaining control.

00:18:48.044 --> 00:18:50.672 position:50% align:center
It's pretty intense,
especially for beginners,

00:18:50.755 --> 00:18:53.299 position:50% align:center
but aim for three sets of
however many you can manage

00:18:53.383 --> 00:18:54.801 position:50% align:center
and work up from there.

00:18:54.884 --> 00:18:57.303 position:50% align:center
Warning: Burpees require
a lot of movement,

00:18:57.387 --> 00:19:00.223 position:50% align:center
so if you're at home instead of
on the beach, be sure to check

00:19:00.306 --> 00:19:03.059 position:50% align:center
your surroundings carefully
before you let loose.

00:19:03.143 --> 00:19:06.354 position:50% align:center
Burpees are good for your
body, from head to toe.

00:19:06.438 --> 00:19:09.733 position:50% align:center
Now let's get swole
on the beach together!

00:19:09.816 --> 00:19:11.443 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI grunting]

00:19:13.653 --> 00:19:15.697 position:50% align:center

00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:17.449 position:50% align:center
[AYAKA grunts]

00:19:20.994 --> 00:19:23.246 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI grunting]

00:19:24.539 --> 00:19:27.334 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI] So what d'you think?
Are burpees the best, or what?

00:19:27.417 --> 00:19:30.128 position:50% align:center
[AYAKA] Doing them at
the beach was a great idea!

00:19:30.211 --> 00:19:32.213 position:50% align:center
They're super effective
in the sand!

00:19:32.297 --> 00:19:34.341 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
I hate it!

00:19:40.513 --> 00:19:43.391 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI, TACHIBANA]
She's trying to kill me.

00:19:45.810 --> 00:19:48.938 position:50% align:center
[TACHIBANA] Actually,
that was kinda fun, huh?

00:19:49.022 --> 00:19:51.066 position:50% align:center
[AYAKA] I know right? See,
you're tougher than you think.

00:19:51.149 --> 00:19:53.860 position:50% align:center
I gotta say, this seemed
kinda crazy at first,

00:19:53.943 --> 00:19:56.488 position:50% align:center
but it's really fun to
work out someplace new.

00:19:56.571 --> 00:19:57.739 position:50% align:center
Break's over!

00:19:57.822 --> 00:20:00.158 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna do some sprints next.
Who's with me?

00:20:00.241 --> 00:20:01.534 position:50% align:center
--[HIBIKI, AKEMI] Me!
--[TACHIBANA] I guess.

00:20:01.618 --> 00:20:02.994 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS panting]

00:20:04.871 --> 00:20:06.289 position:50% align:center
[MAN A] Did they come
all the way out here

00:20:06.373 --> 00:20:07.749 position:50% align:center
just to do strength training?

00:20:07.832 --> 00:20:10.001 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN A]
What hardcore young ladies!

00:20:10.085 --> 00:20:12.462 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] Although the trip
didn't go as planned,

00:20:12.545 --> 00:20:14.923 position:50% align:center
the locals would be talking
about the only tourists

00:20:15.006 --> 00:20:18.051 position:50% align:center
of the season for
quite some time.

00:20:18.134 --> 00:20:22.555 position:50% align:center
And so, before they knew it,
summer came to an end.

00:20:27.394 --> 00:20:28.645 position:50% align:center
[yawns]

00:20:28.728 --> 00:20:30.397 position:50% align:center
Ugh, it's hard to move.

00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:31.981 position:50% align:center
Wow. That's a nice tan!

00:20:32.065 --> 00:20:33.233 position:50% align:center
Don't mock me.

00:20:33.316 --> 00:20:35.360 position:50% align:center
I got it doing strength
training on the beach.

00:20:35.443 --> 00:20:37.278 position:50% align:center
Huh? Is that a thing?

00:20:37.362 --> 00:20:39.406 position:50% align:center
[TACHIBANA]
Second semester starts today.

00:20:39.489 --> 00:20:40.657 position:50% align:center
I'm a little worried.

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:43.201 position:50% align:center
I hope those girls aren't
as tired as I am.

00:20:43.284 --> 00:20:44.911 position:50% align:center
I wanna go back to the beach!

00:20:44.994 --> 00:20:45.829 position:50% align:center
Me, too!

00:20:45.912 --> 00:20:46.913 position:50% align:center
Why aren't we
there right now?

00:20:46.996 --> 00:20:48.039 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS laugh]

00:20:48.123 --> 00:20:51.167 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
This is the power of youth.

00:20:51.251 --> 00:20:52.961 position:50% align:center
Terrifying, isn't it?

00:22:23.343 --> 00:22:27.263 position:50% align:center
Today, we are going to
review reverse pushups!

00:22:27.347 --> 00:22:29.599 position:50% align:center
If you've got a chair that
can stay firmly in place,

00:22:29.683 --> 00:22:31.434 position:50% align:center
you've got your own private gym!

00:22:31.518 --> 00:22:33.645 position:50% align:center
Place your hands on the chair
behind you at shoulder-width

00:22:33.728 --> 00:22:35.605 position:50% align:center
and extend your
legs out in front.

00:22:35.689 --> 00:22:37.607 position:50% align:center
Be sure to support your
weight with your arms,

00:22:37.691 --> 00:22:40.443 position:50% align:center
keep your shoulders down
and back, and abs tight.

00:22:40.527 --> 00:22:42.779 position:50% align:center
If you're crazy tall,
you can use a bed.

00:22:42.862 --> 00:22:45.782 position:50% align:center
Now lower yourself slowly
with the strength of your arms.

00:22:45.865 --> 00:22:47.701 position:50% align:center
You've got 20 of these!

00:22:47.784 --> 00:22:49.619 position:50% align:center
Keep your head neutral, okay?

00:22:49.703 --> 00:22:51.413 position:50% align:center
Are you in position, yet?

00:22:51.496 --> 00:22:54.165 position:50% align:center
All right. Let's... go!

00:22:54.249 --> 00:22:56.167 position:50% align:center
That's one.

00:22:56.251 --> 00:22:58.211 position:50% align:center
Two.

00:22:58.294 --> 00:23:00.797 position:50% align:center
Three.

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:01.881 position:50% align:center
Four...

00:23:01.965 --> 00:23:03.633 position:50% align:center
Make sure you keep
breathing!

00:23:03.717 --> 00:23:05.218 position:50% align:center
Don't hold your breath!

00:23:05.301 --> 00:23:06.761 position:50% align:center
...six...

00:23:06.845 --> 00:23:09.472 position:50% align:center
Your delts and triceps
are loving you right now!

00:23:09.556 --> 00:23:11.516 position:50% align:center
Trust me on this!

00:23:11.599 --> 00:23:14.144 position:50% align:center
This is so hard!

00:23:14.227 --> 00:23:17.772 position:50% align:center
You can't rely on
momentum, remember?

00:23:17.856 --> 00:23:18.898 position:50% align:center
That's 12.

00:23:18.982 --> 00:23:22.444 position:50% align:center
You're smoking that
chest, believe me!

00:23:22.527 --> 00:23:23.820 position:50% align:center
14...

00:23:23.903 --> 00:23:26.906 position:50% align:center
If you do them slower,
then they're super intense.

00:23:26.990 --> 00:23:29.993 position:50% align:center
Fight through the pain!
Almost there!

00:23:30.076 --> 00:23:34.497 position:50% align:center

take a breather if you need to.

Last one!

Great job, guys.

00:23:38.835 --> 00:23:39.836 position:50% align:center
You killed it!

Pat yourself on the back!

00:23:41.296 --> 00:23:42.589 position:50% align:center
Keep up the good work,
