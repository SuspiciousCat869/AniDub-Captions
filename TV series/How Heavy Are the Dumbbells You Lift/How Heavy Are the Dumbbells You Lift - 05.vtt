run with batons.

The plus side about
being seen as a thick girl

00:00:44.669 --> 00:00:46.338 position:50% align:center
is no one wants you
on their team.

Oh. One more thing.

00:00:48.631 --> 00:00:51.092 position:50% align:center

00:03:12.108 --> 00:03:15.195 position:50% align:center

If Ayaka and Akemi
have runner bods.

00:03:21.493 --> 00:03:23.828 position:50% align:center
Then two of these things
are not like the others.

just generalize me?

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:45.058 position:50% align:center
You can't change your height
or bone structure, of course.

00:03:45.141 --> 00:03:46.851 position:50% align:center
But you can improve your speed.

00:03:46.935 --> 00:03:49.354 position:50% align:center
By training the muscles in
your legs, you're adding power

00:03:49.437 --> 00:03:51.314 position:50% align:center
to the vehicle that carries
your entire body.

00:03:51.398 --> 00:03:52.899 position:50% align:center
Cool, so what do we do?

00:03:52.982 --> 00:03:55.068 position:50% align:center
Hold on, so does that
mean the lower muscles

00:03:55.151 --> 00:03:56.403 position:50% align:center
are the most important?

00:03:56.486 --> 00:03:59.155 position:50% align:center
In a way. They're the ones
that provide movement.

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:01.491 position:50% align:center
Not to mention back
and knee support.

00:04:01.574 --> 00:04:04.285 position:50% align:center

00:04:11.668 --> 00:04:13.628 position:50% align:center
Today, let's talk hamstrings.

00:04:13.712 --> 00:04:15.213 position:50% align:center
They're the most important
muscles to train

00:04:15.296 --> 00:04:16.673 position:50% align:center
to improve your speed.

00:04:16.756 --> 00:04:18.508 position:50% align:center
They're also known
as your accelerators

00:04:18.591 --> 00:04:20.135 position:50% align:center
because they're the
muscles that are engaged

00:04:20.218 --> 00:04:21.678 position:50% align:center
when stepping or
running forward.

00:04:21.761 --> 00:04:24.764 position:50% align:center
They allow you to push off with
a jump and take wide steps.

[TACHIBANA]
Oh, that's great news.

00:04:26.433 --> 00:04:27.892 position:50% align:center
So I can do a few
squats as my workout

00:04:27.976 --> 00:04:29.894 position:50% align:center

00:04:29.978 --> 00:04:30.770 position:50% align:center
[MACHIO]
Nope.

00:04:30.854 --> 00:04:32.397 position:50% align:center
Not when trying to build speed.

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.232 position:50% align:center
Squats work out the whole leg,

00:04:34.315 --> 00:04:36.568 position:50% align:center
and that includes your
opposing quadricep muscles,

00:04:36.651 --> 00:04:38.570 position:50% align:center
which are also called
the "break" muscles.

00:04:38.653 --> 00:04:40.155 position:50% align:center
I don't know what that means.

00:04:40.238 --> 00:04:41.781 position:50% align:center
[MACHIO]
I haven't explained it yet.

00:04:41.865 --> 00:04:45.160 position:50% align:center
It means their primary function
is to help you move backwards.

00:04:45.243 --> 00:04:47.495 position:50% align:center
This is important, but
to increase acceleration,

00:04:47.579 --> 00:04:50.040 position:50% align:center
your hamstrings require
a more targeted exercise,

00:04:50.123 --> 00:04:51.833 position:50% align:center
which brings us
to our first lesson!

00:04:51.916 --> 00:04:53.251 position:50% align:center
This is called a leg curl.

00:04:53.335 --> 00:04:54.586 position:50% align:center
Well, not this.

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:56.087 position:50% align:center

Here we go.

00:05:02.218 --> 00:05:04.012 position:50% align:center
Position your body
to stabilize the hips

00:05:04.095 --> 00:05:05.597 position:50% align:center
and balance with the arms.

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.308 position:50% align:center
Slowly curl your legs up until
the pad nearly touches your rear

00:05:08.391 --> 00:05:10.727 position:50% align:center
and hold it for a few seconds
before dropping back down.

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:12.062 position:50% align:center
That counts as one.

00:05:12.145 --> 00:05:14.230 position:50% align:center
A set of 15 reps with
a manageable weight

00:05:14.314 --> 00:05:16.441 position:50% align:center
that provides resistance
is all you need.

Give yourself room to grow
and don't go too heavy.

00:05:19.444 --> 00:05:22.113 position:50% align:center
The top of the hamstring muscle
connects to the lower buttocks,

00:05:22.197 --> 00:05:23.990 position:50% align:center
which means any curl
or deadlift will create

00:08:22.711 --> 00:08:24.379 position:50% align:center
That's totally fine by me.

00:08:24.462 --> 00:08:25.630 position:50% align:center
I would much rather compete

00:08:25.714 --> 00:08:27.340 position:50% align:center
without having to
worry about scores.

00:08:27.424 --> 00:08:28.925 position:50% align:center
[AINA]
Miss Sakura, let's go!

00:08:29.009 --> 00:08:31.386 position:50% align:center
I need you to hurry and
put your relay pants on.

00:08:31.469 --> 00:08:34.431 position:50% align:center
And good news, the relay's
about five trillion points now.

00:08:34.514 --> 00:08:36.683 position:50% align:center
So we still have a chance
to make a comeback.

00:08:36.766 --> 00:08:39.602 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI] Who got drunk
and made up these rules?!

00:08:39.686 --> 00:08:41.354 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
This is the final event.

00:08:41.438 --> 00:08:43.732 position:50% align:center
The 400-meter relay.

00:08:43.815 --> 00:08:45.900 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
How'd I end up running last?

00:08:45.984 --> 00:08:48.445 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah.
Stupid Rock-Paper-scissors.

00:08:48.528 --> 00:08:50.947 position:50% align:center
Which means I have
to go up against her.

00:08:51.031 --> 00:08:52.949 position:50% align:center
Abeno from Class C.

00:08:53.033 --> 00:08:55.118 position:50% align:center
Oh, and Minato
from Class E, cool.

00:08:55.201 --> 00:08:57.162 position:50% align:center
She's on the track team
and does this on the reg.

00:08:57.245 --> 00:08:58.371 position:50% align:center
Real fair.

00:08:58.455 --> 00:09:00.457 position:50% align:center
But they're nowhere near
as bad as that one.

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:03.001 position:50% align:center
What am I supposed to
do with frikkin' Akemi?

00:09:03.084 --> 00:09:05.420 position:50% align:center
Hey Heebs, don't feel like
you have to go easy on me.

00:09:05.503 --> 00:09:06.671 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI laughs]

00:09:06.755 --> 00:09:09.049 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] Side note:
Class A is consistently

00:09:09.132 --> 00:09:12.010 position:50% align:center
in the lead thanks to
our good friend Akemi.

00:09:12.093 --> 00:09:13.261 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
It's like she's part machine

00:09:13.345 --> 00:09:15.221 position:50% align:center
and can predict
anyone's next move.

00:09:15.305 --> 00:09:18.224 position:50% align:center
Not to mention she's freakishly
fast and impossible to pass.

00:09:18.308 --> 00:09:20.018 position:50% align:center
During last year's
relay she flew past

00:09:20.101 --> 00:09:22.479 position:50% align:center
the entire track team
and won first place.

00:09:22.562 --> 00:09:25.273 position:50% align:center
Everyone started calling her
"The Joyner of Koyo."

00:09:25.357 --> 00:09:27.859 position:50% align:center
Not gonna lie, I had
to look that one up.

00:09:27.942 --> 00:09:29.569 position:50% align:center
But what is she even
talking about?

00:09:29.652 --> 00:09:31.404 position:50% align:center
I haven't been
going easy on her!

00:09:31.488 --> 00:09:33.239 position:50% align:center
[STUDENTS cheering]

00:09:33.323 --> 00:09:34.532 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
What she doesn't know

00:09:34.616 --> 00:09:36.993 position:50% align:center
is that I've secretly been
training for this!

00:09:37.077 --> 00:09:39.079 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] Right. That.
Now where'd I put my flashback?

00:09:39.162 --> 00:09:42.040 position:50% align:center
What? So you're saying
I can run even faster?

00:09:42.123 --> 00:09:43.291 position:50% align:center
Always!

00:09:43.375 --> 00:09:45.710 position:50% align:center
You can train your body
to do almost anything.

00:09:45.794 --> 00:09:48.338 position:50% align:center
Remember when we talked about
training hamstrings for speed?

00:09:48.421 --> 00:09:51.174 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI] Yeah, and we did all
those painful leg curls.

00:09:51.257 --> 00:09:52.842 position:50% align:center
[MACHIO] Hamstrings are
accelerator muscles

00:09:52.926 --> 00:09:55.845 position:50% align:center
that help you sprint forward,
but there's another one.

00:09:55.929 --> 00:09:58.598 position:50% align:center
We can train them both together
for better control of speed.

00:09:58.682 --> 00:10:00.016 position:50% align:center
I don't wanna be greedy!

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:02.811 position:50% align:center
We call it...

00:10:02.894 --> 00:10:03.645 position:50% align:center
[MACHIO grunts]

00:10:03.728 --> 00:10:05.271 position:50% align:center
[MACHIO]
...the iliopsoas!

00:10:05.355 --> 00:10:07.607 position:50% align:center
I really didn't need a
close-up visual, thanks!

00:10:07.691 --> 00:10:10.068 position:50% align:center
[MACHIO] The Iliopsoas braces
your spine from the sides

00:10:10.151 --> 00:10:11.903 position:50% align:center
and keeps it supported
as you run.

00:10:11.986 --> 00:10:14.030 position:50% align:center
It also stabilizes your core.

00:10:14.114 --> 00:10:16.825 position:50% align:center
But most importantly, it
controls your hip movements.

00:10:16.908 --> 00:10:18.034 position:50% align:center
Meaning?

00:10:18.118 --> 00:10:19.369 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI] It can also
make my legs go faster

00:10:19.452 --> 00:10:20.412 position:50% align:center
since they're attached!

00:10:20.495 --> 00:10:21.746 position:50% align:center
Exactly!

00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:24.290 position:50% align:center
Sprinters train their
iliopsoas muscles.

00:10:24.374 --> 00:10:27.210 position:50% align:center
And they really focus in
on the psoas muscle.

00:10:27.293 --> 00:10:29.921 position:50% align:center
We haven't had a real reason
to target that area until now,

00:10:30.005 --> 00:10:31.131 position:50% align:center
but let's work on that today.

00:10:31.214 --> 00:10:33.216 position:50% align:center
And you can do this
exercise from home, too!

00:10:33.299 --> 00:10:34.884 position:50% align:center
Just follow along
wherever you are

00:10:34.968 --> 00:10:36.469 position:50% align:center
and you're sure to
see improvement!

00:10:36.553 --> 00:10:37.554 position:50% align:center
Quick question.

00:10:37.637 --> 00:10:39.305 position:50% align:center
Who the hell are you talking to?

00:10:39.389 --> 00:10:41.182 position:50% align:center
This is called a
bicycle crunch.

00:10:41.266 --> 00:10:44.227 position:50% align:center
It's a two-for-one, because
it also works your core.

00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:46.354 position:50% align:center
Start by laying on your
back, shoulder blades

00:10:46.438 --> 00:10:48.314 position:50% align:center
down and hands folded
behind your head.

00:10:48.398 --> 00:10:50.233 position:50% align:center
Lift at least your shoulder
blades off the floor

00:10:50.316 --> 00:10:52.318 position:50% align:center
and the legs to a
slightly bent position.

00:10:52.402 --> 00:10:54.571 position:50% align:center
Keep your abs tight as
you bring one knee up,

00:10:54.654 --> 00:10:56.031 position:50% align:center
touch it to the
opposite elbow,

00:10:56.114 --> 00:10:57.991 position:50% align:center
pause and squeeze the abs.

00:10:58.074 --> 00:11:00.201 position:50% align:center
Use your core to alternate
right leg to left elbow

00:11:00.285 --> 00:11:01.286 position:50% align:center
and vice versa.

00:11:01.369 --> 00:11:03.455 position:50% align:center
Keep alternating
legs until failure.

00:11:03.538 --> 00:11:06.583 position:50% align:center
You can also vary the speed
to increase intensity.

00:11:06.666 --> 00:11:09.210 position:50% align:center
Bicycle crunches are great
for the rectus abdominis,

00:11:09.294 --> 00:11:12.797 position:50% align:center
the oblique abdominals, and of
course the iliopsoas muscles.

00:11:12.881 --> 00:11:14.007 position:50% align:center
You guys ready to go?

00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:16.468 position:50% align:center
Let's start with three
sets of 20! Heh!

00:11:16.551 --> 00:11:17.719 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
Sweet!

00:11:17.802 --> 00:11:19.596 position:50% align:center
I can do those at home
before bed or something.

00:11:19.679 --> 00:11:20.805 position:50% align:center
And you should!

00:11:20.889 --> 00:11:22.307 position:50% align:center
There's another benefit.

00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:25.852 position:50% align:center
Lots of clients love the results
they see in their figure!

00:11:25.935 --> 00:11:27.687 position:50% align:center
Since these muscles
all taper down,

00:11:27.771 --> 00:11:29.356 position:50% align:center
strong obliques add
length to the core

00:11:29.439 --> 00:11:30.940 position:50% align:center
and a create a very
slender waist.

00:11:31.024 --> 00:11:34.778 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI gasping]
Let's do this!

00:11:36.863 --> 00:11:38.281 position:50% align:center
[STUDENTS cheer]

00:11:38.365 --> 00:11:40.116 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI] I crushed those,
then the next day I was so sore

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:42.202 position:50% align:center
I couldn't move and had
to stay home from school.

00:11:42.285 --> 00:11:44.329 position:50% align:center
I may have overdone it a little.

00:11:50.293 --> 00:11:51.544 position:50% align:center
You're almost there!

00:11:51.628 --> 00:11:53.880 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI] She has no idea
what's comin' for her.

00:11:53.963 --> 00:11:57.258 position:50% align:center
I've been working on operation
iliopsoas at home hardcore.

00:11:57.342 --> 00:11:59.636 position:50% align:center
I've got "runs"
like she's never seen.

00:11:59.719 --> 00:12:00.804 position:50% align:center
Wait, that didn't sound right.

00:12:00.887 --> 00:12:02.222 position:50% align:center
Go! Go!

00:12:02.305 --> 00:12:04.641 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI] Wow, she's fast.
But I got this. I think.

00:12:04.724 --> 00:12:07.185 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER A] Our third runners
have just rounded the corner!

00:12:07.268 --> 00:12:09.562 position:50% align:center
Classes A and B are
currently neck and neck!

00:12:09.646 --> 00:12:11.314 position:50% align:center
It's all up to
our final runners!

00:12:11.398 --> 00:12:12.816 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI] You've been
training hard, Hibiki.

00:12:12.899 --> 00:12:14.734 position:50% align:center
Let's see what you've got!
I'm ready.

00:12:14.818 --> 00:12:17.153 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI] The only goal I had
today was not to lose.

00:12:17.237 --> 00:12:19.906 position:50% align:center
But now I'm determined to
take her all the way out!

00:12:19.989 --> 00:12:21.825 position:50% align:center
You're goin' down, ho!

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:24.994 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:29.457 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
Crap, crap, crap, crap!

00:12:29.541 --> 00:12:31.334 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT B] Give it to me.
Where are you going?

00:12:31.418 --> 00:12:32.961 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
I know I've lost at this point,

00:12:33.044 --> 00:12:34.421 position:50% align:center
but I'm not done yet!

00:12:34.504 --> 00:12:36.006 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI]
She's gotten so fast!

00:12:36.089 --> 00:12:37.757 position:50% align:center
I knew you had
it in you, Hibiki.

00:12:37.841 --> 00:12:41.052 position:50% align:center
Nice work, but there's
no way I'm going to lose!

00:12:42.053 --> 00:12:43.847 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
Nothing's working!

00:12:51.438 --> 00:12:53.273 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
Why is this happening?!

00:12:53.356 --> 00:12:55.191 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI grunts, gasps]

00:12:55.942 --> 00:12:58.236 position:50% align:center
[STUDENTS cheer]

00:12:58.319 --> 00:13:00.780 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI panting]

00:13:06.828 --> 00:13:10.749 position:50% align:center
You gotta be kidding me. After
all that, I came in second?

00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:16.629 position:50% align:center
What a killer sprint
you have! Wow!

00:13:16.713 --> 00:13:19.132 position:50% align:center
[laughs] Thank you.

00:13:20.383 --> 00:13:21.301 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI giggles]

00:13:21.384 --> 00:13:22.385 position:50% align:center
[whistle blows]

00:13:22.469 --> 00:13:24.220 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:13:24.304 --> 00:13:25.430 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
What the...?

00:13:25.513 --> 00:13:27.015 position:50% align:center
What are you doing out
here, Ms. Tachibana?

00:13:27.098 --> 00:13:29.059 position:50% align:center
I asked myself
that same question.

00:13:29.142 --> 00:13:30.643 position:50% align:center
I'm the referee.

00:13:30.727 --> 00:13:31.853 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Huh?

00:13:33.104 --> 00:13:34.564 position:50% align:center
[TACHIBANA]
What that means is...

00:13:34.647 --> 00:13:36.691 position:50% align:center
Since you weren't the one who
dropped the baton initially,

00:13:36.775 --> 00:13:38.318 position:50% align:center
you shouldn't have been
the one to pick it up.

00:13:38.401 --> 00:13:41.154 position:50% align:center
It's against one of the many
"helpful" rules of relay racing.

00:13:41.237 --> 00:13:43.656 position:50% align:center
What? Since when? Why?

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:46.159 position:50% align:center
Uh, I dunno, that's just
what I was told.

00:13:46.242 --> 00:13:48.870 position:50% align:center
So, Class B's disqualified.

00:13:48.953 --> 00:13:50.830 position:50% align:center
--[STUDENTS groaning]
--[AYAKA chuckling]

00:13:50.914 --> 00:13:53.375 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] Everyone learned
a valuable lesson that day,

00:13:53.458 --> 00:13:54.959 position:50% align:center
about paying attention
to the rules,

00:13:55.043 --> 00:13:57.420 position:50% align:center
and of course, friendship.

00:13:57.504 --> 00:14:01.841 position:50% align:center
Hibiki was inconsolable
for 48 hours.

00:14:02.342 --> 00:14:04.344 position:50% align:center
[MACHIO] All right team,
I think we've all done enough

00:14:04.427 --> 00:14:07.305 position:50% align:center
for one day, don't you?
Great work everyone!

00:14:07.389 --> 00:14:09.140 position:50% align:center
--[TACHIBANA] Thank you!
--[AYAKA] Aww!

00:14:09.224 --> 00:14:10.308 position:50% align:center
Heh!

00:14:10.392 --> 00:14:12.310 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI sighs]
I'm beat!

00:14:12.394 --> 00:14:14.854 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI] Today's exercises were
really challenging!

00:14:14.938 --> 00:14:16.106 position:50% align:center
Hey, hold on a sec!

00:14:16.189 --> 00:14:18.483 position:50% align:center
I almost forgot, I have
something for you guys!

00:14:18.566 --> 00:14:20.443 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS]
Huh?

00:14:20.527 --> 00:14:22.737 position:50% align:center
[MACHIO] It's been almost half
a year since the gym opened.

00:14:22.821 --> 00:14:25.490 position:50% align:center
So we're celebrating
with a raffle!

00:14:25.573 --> 00:14:28.284 position:50% align:center
And we're giving every member
one ticket as a free gift!

00:14:28.368 --> 00:14:29.994 position:50% align:center
Happy six-month anniversary!

00:14:30.078 --> 00:14:32.497 position:50% align:center
Cool, but what are
you raffling off?

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:35.083 position:50% align:center
Great question! The prizes
are actually pretty awesome!

00:14:35.166 --> 00:14:37.335 position:50% align:center
Sweet! But that
wasn't an answer.

00:14:37.419 --> 00:14:39.713 position:50% align:center
It's way more fun not
to know until you win!

00:14:39.796 --> 00:14:42.799 position:50% align:center
I promise you'll love it, so
hurry and give it a try! Okay?

00:14:42.882 --> 00:14:44.718 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
'Kay!

00:14:44.801 --> 00:14:45.677 position:50% align:center
[MACHIO]
Try...

00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:48.304 position:50% align:center
Try... Tri...

00:14:48.388 --> 00:14:49.347 position:50% align:center
...ceps!

00:14:49.431 --> 00:14:51.808 position:50% align:center
[grunting]

00:14:51.891 --> 00:14:53.226 position:50% align:center
Triceps flex-town, yeah!

00:14:53.309 --> 00:14:54.561 position:50% align:center
[AYAKA]
This better be good, Machio.

00:14:54.644 --> 00:14:56.062 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI] Let's do it
after we get dressed!

00:14:56.146 --> 00:14:58.565 position:50% align:center
I'm so muscular!

00:14:59.566 --> 00:15:03.069 position:50% align:center
Ah... Man, why'd I have
to eat a crap sandwich?

00:15:03.153 --> 00:15:04.487 position:50% align:center
Field day frikkin' sucks.

00:15:04.571 --> 00:15:06.239 position:50% align:center
Omigod, get over it.

00:15:06.322 --> 00:15:08.158 position:50% align:center
For what it's worth,
I didn't think you deserved

00:15:08.241 --> 00:15:09.242 position:50% align:center
to be disqualified.

00:15:09.325 --> 00:15:10.368 position:50% align:center
You're right, I didn't.

00:15:10.452 --> 00:15:11.911 position:50% align:center
Not after I've been
training so hard.

00:15:11.995 --> 00:15:15.123 position:50% align:center
Ugh. Ms. Tachibana, you
should've pretended not to see.

00:15:15.206 --> 00:15:16.750 position:50% align:center
I thought we were bros.

00:15:16.833 --> 00:15:18.501 position:50% align:center
There's no way I
could've done that.

00:15:18.585 --> 00:15:21.171 position:50% align:center
Every single student and teacher
was watching me out there.

00:15:21.254 --> 00:15:22.756 position:50% align:center
[AYAKA] I don't know why
you're wasting your energy

00:15:22.839 --> 00:15:24.341 position:50% align:center
talking about things
you can't change.

00:15:24.424 --> 00:15:26.926 position:50% align:center
Either let it go or
plan your revenge.

00:15:27.010 --> 00:15:28.470 position:50% align:center
Ooh, revenge.

00:15:28.553 --> 00:15:31.056 position:50% align:center
Hey, since we have some time
before we have to leave,

00:15:31.139 --> 00:15:32.515 position:50% align:center
do you guys wanna
hang out in the sauna

00:15:32.599 --> 00:15:33.850 position:50% align:center
after we all take showers?

00:15:33.933 --> 00:15:34.684 position:50% align:center
--[AYAKA] Sounds dope.
--[TACHIBANA] Yeah, sure.

00:15:34.768 --> 00:15:35.685 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
Oh, hell yeah!

00:15:37.729 --> 00:15:40.106 position:50% align:center
Hi! Today I'm going to
teach you some benefits

00:15:40.190 --> 00:15:42.275 position:50% align:center
of using the sauna and
how not to be an animal!

00:15:42.359 --> 00:15:44.319 position:50% align:center
You can hang out in
any position you want.

00:15:44.402 --> 00:15:46.154 position:50% align:center
That doesn't mean
start doing yoga poses.

00:15:46.237 --> 00:15:48.198 position:50% align:center
Just relax and
don't annoy anyone.

00:15:48.281 --> 00:15:51.076 position:50% align:center
Oh! And here's a fact
that's not so fun.

00:15:51.159 --> 00:15:53.703 position:50% align:center
If you think you'll burn fat by
sitting in here, you're wrong,

00:15:53.787 --> 00:15:55.330 position:50% align:center
but it's not your fault!

00:15:55.413 --> 00:15:56.748 position:50% align:center
Your body's actually a liar

00:15:56.831 --> 00:15:58.249 position:50% align:center
and will sweat out
a bunch of water,

00:15:58.333 --> 00:16:01.670 position:50% align:center
making your weight temporarily
go down and tricking you.

00:16:01.753 --> 00:16:03.421 position:50% align:center
So, here are some benefits.

00:16:03.505 --> 00:16:05.006 position:50% align:center
None of which are
about your weight.

00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:08.009 position:50% align:center
First of all, saunas
improve blood circulation.

00:16:08.093 --> 00:16:09.803 position:50% align:center
When you've got
blood flowing freely

00:16:09.886 --> 00:16:11.721 position:50% align:center
through your muscles,
you won't have that stiff

00:16:11.805 --> 00:16:13.807 position:50% align:center
"I slept like crap"
feeling in your body.

00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:16.476 position:50% align:center
B of all, the sauna gets all
that gunk out of your pores

00:16:16.559 --> 00:16:18.728 position:50% align:center
and makes your skin
glow like a moonbeam!

00:16:18.812 --> 00:16:21.481 position:50% align:center
Three, getting rid of excess
water makes you less puffy.

00:16:21.564 --> 00:16:23.108 position:50% align:center
If you get fatty
fingers or cankles,

00:16:23.191 --> 00:16:24.693 position:50% align:center
get in here and make it stop!

00:16:24.776 --> 00:16:26.277 position:50% align:center
Don't use the sauna
when you're sick.

00:16:26.361 --> 00:16:28.822 position:50% align:center
It's gross. Your body can
fight its own battles.

00:16:28.905 --> 00:16:31.491 position:50% align:center
And guys, don't get in the
sauna when you're drunk.

00:16:31.574 --> 00:16:34.494 position:50% align:center
I'm not talking to everyone,
but you know who you are.

00:16:34.577 --> 00:16:36.162 position:50% align:center
And hey, the sauna
is kinda like

00:16:36.246 --> 00:16:39.666 position:50% align:center
a giant fragrance diffuser,
so please take a shower before.

00:16:39.749 --> 00:16:41.960 position:50% align:center
No one can relax when your
'eau de sweat 'n stank'

00:16:42.043 --> 00:16:43.753 position:50% align:center
is filling the atmosphere.

00:16:43.837 --> 00:16:47.257 position:50% align:center
Basically, have manners,
don't be grody, and enjoy!

00:16:50.927 --> 00:16:52.804 position:50% align:center
[ALL sigh]

00:16:54.597 --> 00:16:57.851 position:50% align:center
The sauna is my
bestest friend ever!

00:16:57.934 --> 00:17:00.437 position:50% align:center
It's the greatest thing
Japan's ever created.

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:03.314 position:50% align:center
Actually, they were
invented in Finland.

00:17:03.398 --> 00:17:07.736 position:50% align:center
Great call. This was exactly
what I needed today.

00:17:07.819 --> 00:17:10.071 position:50% align:center
I'm impressed that you
guys can handle this heat!

00:17:10.155 --> 00:17:11.489 position:50% align:center
Uh, duh!

00:17:11.573 --> 00:17:13.283 position:50% align:center
You think this is the first time
I've ever been in one?

00:17:13.366 --> 00:17:15.410 position:50% align:center
Oh, Well, it's new for me,

00:17:15.493 --> 00:17:16.870 position:50% align:center
but I'm feeling pretty
good about it.

00:17:16.953 --> 00:17:18.788 position:50% align:center
It's actually very relaxing.

00:17:18.872 --> 00:17:20.165 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah?

00:17:20.248 --> 00:17:22.834 position:50% align:center
Then I've got a little
proposition for each of you.

00:17:22.917 --> 00:17:26.004 position:50% align:center
I know what the first prize is.
For the raffle, I mean.

00:17:26.087 --> 00:17:27.714 position:50% align:center
It's a round trip to America!

00:17:27.797 --> 00:17:28.965 position:50% align:center
[AYAKA, TACHIBANA]
Shut up!

00:17:29.049 --> 00:17:31.426 position:50% align:center
Here's what.
We all hang out in here.

00:17:31.509 --> 00:17:32.969 position:50% align:center
Whoever can last
the longest wins

00:17:33.053 --> 00:17:34.763 position:50% align:center
and gets everyone
else's raffle tickets.

00:17:34.846 --> 00:17:36.806 position:50% align:center
I mean. I'm in,
of course, but...

00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:39.142 position:50% align:center
Are you doing what I think
you're doing, Hibiki?

00:17:39.225 --> 00:17:41.061 position:50% align:center
Yay! Count me in, please!

00:17:41.144 --> 00:17:43.480 position:50% align:center
Awesome! I'm winning that trip!

00:17:43.563 --> 00:17:45.148 position:50% align:center
You sure? I mean,

00:17:45.231 --> 00:17:47.400 position:50% align:center
should you really be gambling
with under age students?

00:17:47.484 --> 00:17:49.152 position:50% align:center
[TACHIBANA] I wasn't
planning on telling anyone!

00:17:49.235 --> 00:17:51.613 position:50% align:center
And if you try to get me
in trouble, I'll deny it!

00:17:51.696 --> 00:17:53.156 position:50% align:center
That's dark.

00:17:53.239 --> 00:17:55.784 position:50% align:center
You know what's weird, I've
always wanted to go to America!

00:17:55.867 --> 00:17:57.619 position:50% align:center
But the prize I want
the most is the official

00:17:57.702 --> 00:17:59.871 position:50% align:center
Silverman Gym T-shirt
for my workouts!

00:17:59.954 --> 00:18:02.332 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
We get it. You love exercise.

00:18:02.415 --> 00:18:03.917 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] Warning: the
following scene is played

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.169 position:50% align:center
by anime characters and
would be extremely dangerous

00:18:06.252 --> 00:18:08.254 position:50% align:center
if attempted by actual humans.

00:18:08.338 --> 00:18:11.007 position:50% align:center
And... Go!

00:18:11.091 --> 00:18:12.759 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI humming]

00:18:23.144 --> 00:18:23.978 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI sighs]

00:18:24.062 --> 00:18:25.313 position:50% align:center
[AYAKA grunts]

00:18:36.783 --> 00:18:39.411 position:50% align:center
[panting]

00:18:52.257 --> 00:18:54.676 position:50% align:center
Oh damn, you're all still here.

00:18:58.930 --> 00:19:02.058 position:50% align:center
I'm out! You guys're crazy!

00:19:02.392 --> 00:19:05.478 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] First woman down,
Ayaka Uehara!

00:19:09.107 --> 00:19:11.776 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI groans]
I can't take this anymore!

00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:15.613 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
Oh, Akemi Soryuin. Soryou-out!

00:19:15.697 --> 00:19:17.407 position:50% align:center
[panting]

00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:19.576 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
There. Now we're even.

00:19:19.659 --> 00:19:23.204 position:50% align:center
Miss "I'm gonna win the relay
even though I don't deserve it."

00:19:23.288 --> 00:19:24.998 position:50% align:center
Crap, I'm getting dizzy.

00:19:25.081 --> 00:19:29.044 position:50% align:center
I can't think. What time is it?

00:19:32.505 --> 00:19:34.591 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
How long have I been in here?

00:19:34.674 --> 00:19:36.593 position:50% align:center
Thirty minutes? An hour?

00:19:36.676 --> 00:19:40.388 position:50% align:center
Damn it! I'm usually
so much better at this!

00:19:40.472 --> 00:19:41.639 position:50% align:center
Oh, come on.

00:19:41.723 --> 00:19:43.933 position:50% align:center
Ms. Tachibana is
still in the game?

00:19:44.017 --> 00:19:47.854 position:50% align:center
Against me?
That's... That's stupid!

00:19:47.937 --> 00:19:51.441 position:50% align:center
Am I about to lose again,
to a teacher?

00:19:51.524 --> 00:19:53.151 position:50% align:center
But she's old!

00:19:53.234 --> 00:19:56.237 position:50% align:center
Am I hallucinating?
Is she actually that chill?

00:19:56.321 --> 00:19:58.406 position:50% align:center
She doesn't even look
like she's breathing!

00:19:58.490 --> 00:20:02.869 position:50% align:center
I can't do it.
I'm gonna pass out.

00:20:02.952 --> 00:20:05.413 position:50% align:center
I guess this means
she's the winner.

00:20:05.497 --> 00:20:06.623 position:50% align:center
Uh?!

00:20:07.582 --> 00:20:09.417 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
Ms. Tachibana?

00:20:13.588 --> 00:20:16.091 position:50% align:center
She's completely burned!

00:20:16.174 --> 00:20:17.842 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] In the battle
of the most competitive,

00:20:17.926 --> 00:20:20.845 position:50% align:center
Hibiki and Ms. Tachibana
are tied for best...

00:20:20.929 --> 00:20:22.263 position:50% align:center
...and worst.

00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:26.476 position:50% align:center
Congrats!

00:20:26.559 --> 00:20:28.937 position:50% align:center
You won an official
Silverman Gym T-shirt!

00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:31.398 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
What?!

00:20:31.481 --> 00:20:33.942 position:50% align:center
Wow. I didn't just win one.

00:20:34.025 --> 00:20:36.528 position:50% align:center
I got four of these
fugly gray t-shirts. Yay.

00:20:36.611 --> 00:20:38.488 position:50% align:center
Why can't I be you?!

00:20:38.571 --> 00:20:40.699 position:50% align:center
The official Silverman
Gym t-shirt.

00:20:40.782 --> 00:20:43.326 position:50% align:center
Coveted by dedicated trainees
all across the country.

00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:45.412 position:50% align:center
You can't buy the classic
silver and black design

00:20:45.495 --> 00:20:47.789 position:50% align:center
anywhere anymore! It's vintage!

00:20:47.872 --> 00:20:49.207 position:50% align:center
A rare find.

00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:51.418 position:50% align:center
It even has the original owner's
calligraphy as a logo

00:20:51.501 --> 00:20:53.545 position:50% align:center
so it's like he's
always touching it!

00:20:53.628 --> 00:20:56.047 position:50% align:center
Yup, and I won it for you.

00:20:56.131 --> 00:20:58.758 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] Four.
She won four of them.

00:22:29.265 --> 00:22:30.392 position:50% align:center
Hey, there!

00:22:30.475 --> 00:22:32.352 position:50% align:center
Today we're going to
do the bicycle crunch!

00:22:32.435 --> 00:22:34.562 position:50% align:center
You can do these
anywhere, even in secret.

00:22:34.646 --> 00:22:37.065 position:50% align:center
Then whip it out on them
when they least expect it!

00:22:37.148 --> 00:22:39.109 position:50% align:center
Do you remember
how to do them?

00:22:39.192 --> 00:22:41.695 position:50% align:center
First lie on your back,
hands behind your head.

00:22:41.778 --> 00:22:44.114 position:50% align:center
Touch your bent knee
to the opposite elbow.

00:22:44.197 --> 00:22:46.700 position:50% align:center
Your goal is to complete
20 on each side.

00:22:46.783 --> 00:22:48.660 position:50% align:center
No slacking.
Make every rep count!

00:22:48.743 --> 00:22:50.495 position:50% align:center
Everyone ready?

00:22:50.578 --> 00:22:52.789 position:50% align:center
Let's go!

00:22:52.872 --> 00:22:56.251 position:50% align:center
[AYAKA] Make sure your elbow
connects with your knee.

00:22:56.334 --> 00:22:58.420 position:50% align:center
[AYAKA] Careful not to pull
your neck with your hands.

00:22:58.503 --> 00:23:00.630 position:50% align:center
Keep them light for
balance and form.

00:23:00.714 --> 00:23:01.673 position:50% align:center
Nine...

00:23:01.756 --> 00:23:02.757 position:50% align:center
Ten...
