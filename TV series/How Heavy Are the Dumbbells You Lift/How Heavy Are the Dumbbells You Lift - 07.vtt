[HIBIKI] I'm surprised I didn't
die of shock yesterday!

00:00:13.138 --> 00:00:14.014 position:50% align:center
You freaked me out!

00:00:14.097 --> 00:00:15.265 position:50% align:center
It's bizarre that no one told me

00:00:15.348 --> 00:00:16.975 position:50% align:center
you were doing your
homestay at my place!

00:00:17.058 --> 00:00:19.686 position:50% align:center
From now on, you and I will be
eating out of the same pot!

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:22.105 position:50% align:center
Did you just say that like
it's an actual expression?

00:00:22.188 --> 00:00:24.816 position:50% align:center
You speak our language super
well for having just moved here.

00:00:24.899 --> 00:00:26.317 position:50% align:center
How are you so fluent?

00:00:26.401 --> 00:00:28.653 position:50% align:center
I watch the little cartoons
that come from your country.

00:00:28.737 --> 00:00:31.072 position:50% align:center
Keep at it, 'cause I
understand you perfectly!

00:00:31.156 --> 00:00:32.407 position:50% align:center
Yeah, makes sense.

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:33.616 position:50% align:center
I know things are
different here,

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.410 position:50% align:center
so let me know if you
need help adjusting.

00:00:35.493 --> 00:00:36.828 position:50% align:center
You're very kind.

00:00:36.911 --> 00:00:38.663 position:50% align:center
But no thanks! I got this!

00:00:38.747 --> 00:00:40.206 position:50% align:center
I have already learned
all there is to know

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.209 position:50% align:center
about your culture by witching
Jackie Chan movies!

00:00:43.293 --> 00:00:45.670 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI] Man, your home school
really let you down.

00:02:21.016 --> 00:02:24.394 position:50% align:center
Don't joke vis me!
Is the gym really closed today?

00:02:24.477 --> 00:02:26.771 position:50% align:center
Yup. Every third
Monday of the month.

00:02:26.855 --> 00:02:28.398 position:50% align:center
Oh, But why?

00:02:28.481 --> 00:02:31.776 position:50% align:center
I know how you feel. It's so
lame when the gym's closed.

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.361 position:50% align:center
Aw! <i>Blyat</i> !

00:02:33.445 --> 00:02:36.197 position:50% align:center
I suppose I'll have to wait for
another time to get my revenge!

00:02:36.281 --> 00:02:38.992 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS] She's not gonna
let that one go, is she?

00:02:39.075 --> 00:02:40.577 position:50% align:center
I know!

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.370 position:50% align:center
We could all go somewhere else
and have a little welcome party?

00:02:42.454 --> 00:02:43.872 position:50% align:center
That would be great!

00:02:43.955 --> 00:02:45.915 position:50% align:center
Maybe we could go chick out Hong
Kong and do some shopping?

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:47.292 position:50% align:center
I've always wanted to see it!

00:02:47.375 --> 00:02:49.210 position:50% align:center
Considering that it's in China,
that would be a no.

00:02:49.294 --> 00:02:50.628 position:50% align:center
My bad.

00:02:50.712 --> 00:02:53.173 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI] I have to work.
You guys have fun without me.

00:02:53.256 --> 00:02:56.843 position:50% align:center
Or, you could come hang with me
and eat at the restaurant?

00:02:59.554 --> 00:03:00.930 position:50% align:center
Are you ready?

00:03:01.014 --> 00:03:03.224 position:50% align:center
Your first round of <i>galbi</i>
should be done by now!

00:03:04.642 --> 00:03:06.269 position:50% align:center
Wow! It smells so good!

00:03:06.353 --> 00:03:07.395 position:50% align:center
[AYAKA]
Put it in me!

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:09.397 position:50% align:center
Those look done to me.

00:03:09.481 --> 00:03:10.648 position:50% align:center
Let's do it!

00:03:10.732 --> 00:03:12.567 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Thank you, Hibiki!

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:19.032 position:50% align:center
Dope!

00:03:19.115 --> 00:03:20.533 position:50% align:center
This is the first time
I've had Japanese barbeque!

00:03:20.617 --> 00:03:21.993 position:50% align:center
Why didn't you ever say
your family owned

00:03:22.077 --> 00:03:23.495 position:50% align:center
a restaurant before?

00:03:23.578 --> 00:03:26.373 position:50% align:center
Because it's not 'that story.'
My big bro decided one day

00:03:26.456 --> 00:03:28.208 position:50% align:center
he was done workin' for
the man and quit.

00:03:28.291 --> 00:03:29.501 position:50% align:center
Now he owns his own business.

00:03:29.584 --> 00:03:31.378 position:50% align:center
I come in when
he's low on staff.

00:03:31.461 --> 00:03:33.505 position:50% align:center
Yeah, what a lovely story.

00:03:33.588 --> 00:03:35.131 position:50% align:center
You keep being you, Hibiki!

00:03:35.215 --> 00:03:36.883 position:50% align:center
I'm so glad you
shared that with us!

00:03:36.966 --> 00:03:38.385 position:50% align:center
Right. You don't care.

00:03:38.468 --> 00:03:40.136 position:50% align:center
I know those lusty beef eyes.

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:41.721 position:50% align:center
Rejoice, my girl-dudes!

Heh, heh. I get it now.

00:03:50.563 --> 00:03:53.316 position:50% align:center
The secret of Hibiki's power
is right under our noses.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.360 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI laughs]

00:03:55.443 --> 00:03:58.029 position:50% align:center
[GINA] She found a way to get
an unlimited supply of nutrients

00:03:58.113 --> 00:04:01.366 position:50% align:center
to fuel her muscles.
Her primary weapon is pure

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:05.745 position:50% align:center
animal protein with the most
powerful of all sources being...

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:08.498 position:50% align:center
...flesh and blood of cow!

00:04:08.581 --> 00:04:10.667 position:50% align:center
She is much smarter
than she looks.

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.293 position:50% align:center
Surrounding herself
with power-meat

00:04:12.377 --> 00:04:14.212 position:50% align:center
and getting paid
at the same time.

00:04:14.295 --> 00:04:16.548 position:50% align:center
That is like throwing
two rocks at one bird.

00:04:16.631 --> 00:04:18.425 position:50% align:center

and I'll keep it comin'!

Awesome!

00:04:20.135 --> 00:04:21.511 position:50% align:center
This looks like the perfect
time to talk about

00:04:21.594 --> 00:04:22.971 position:50% align:center
everyone's favorite
protein source!

00:04:23.054 --> 00:04:24.514 position:50% align:center
Beef of course!

00:04:24.597 --> 00:04:26.224 position:50% align:center

take it from us,

00:04:28.101 --> 00:04:30.687 position:50% align:center
the flesh of a cow is a friend
your mouth needs to know!

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:32.772 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI] Here ya go friends,
try some tenderloin!

00:04:32.856 --> 00:04:34.232 position:50% align:center
Did someone say "tenderloin?"

00:04:34.315 --> 00:04:36.776 position:50% align:center
I bet you had no idea that
different parts of the cow

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.487 position:50% align:center
vary greatly in terms
of nutritional value!

00:04:40.572 --> 00:04:42.532 position:50% align:center
For example,
here's a tenderloin.

00:04:42.615 --> 00:04:46.578 position:50% align:center
It's very low in calories,
but high in protein!

00:04:46.661 --> 00:04:49.372 position:50% align:center
Hey! Who wants some liver?

00:04:50.665 --> 00:04:52.500 position:50% align:center
Liver is very low in calories!

00:04:52.584 --> 00:04:55.962 position:50% align:center
It also helps prevent
that pesky anemia!

00:04:56.046 --> 00:05:00.091 position:50% align:center
'Kay, who's ready
for more <i>galbi,</i> huh?

00:05:00.175 --> 00:05:01.676 position:50% align:center
This is one that'll
sneak up on you.

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.804 position:50% align:center
Galbi is high in nutrients but
also high in sugar and calories.

00:05:04.888 --> 00:05:06.890 position:50% align:center
Be careful not to eat too much.

00:05:06.973 --> 00:05:10.101 position:50% align:center
Also, be aware that local cuts
are much higher in calories

00:05:10.185 --> 00:05:12.729 position:50% align:center
than imported beef, so keep that
in mind when planning meals.

00:05:12.812 --> 00:05:14.397 position:50% align:center
For an easy way
to cut those cals,

00:05:14.481 --> 00:05:16.900 position:50% align:center
try shopping for imported
beef cuts at specialty

00:05:16.983 --> 00:05:18.985 position:50% align:center
grocery stores, or cooking
with white meat or fish.

00:05:19.069 --> 00:05:20.653 position:50% align:center

If you wanna get
that body right,

00:05:37.837 --> 00:05:39.547 position:50% align:center
it's going to require more
than working out.

Secretly. What will she eat?

00:05:56.022 --> 00:05:57.190 position:50% align:center
And how much?

00:05:57.273 --> 00:05:59.567 position:50% align:center

I don't see any beef!

00:06:08.201 --> 00:06:10.161 position:50% align:center
But besides that,
look at these portions!

00:06:10.245 --> 00:06:12.372 position:50% align:center
Is this supposed to be
one person's meal?

Wait...

00:06:15.083 --> 00:06:17.127 position:50% align:center
I've herd of this, but
I don't remember where.

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:19.587 position:50% align:center
Pretty sure it was about
a Japanese pro wrestler.

00:06:19.671 --> 00:06:21.423 position:50% align:center
He said the worst thing
was never the training

00:06:21.506 --> 00:06:22.674 position:50% align:center
or even the injuries.

00:06:22.757 --> 00:06:25.510 position:50% align:center
No, there was something
even more challenging.

00:06:25.593 --> 00:06:28.263 position:50% align:center
It was learning how to eat.

00:06:28.346 --> 00:06:32.934 position:50% align:center
Every day he trained like a
mad man from dawn until dusk.

00:06:33.018 --> 00:06:34.686 position:50% align:center
He only took a break for meals,

00:06:34.769 --> 00:06:37.105 position:50% align:center
and even though his body was
feeling sick from exhaustion,

00:06:37.188 --> 00:06:38.815 position:50% align:center
he was forced to eat
more than he wanted

00:06:38.898 --> 00:06:41.484 position:50% align:center
to in order to
build up his muscles.

00:06:41.568 --> 00:06:43.570 position:50% align:center
When he couldn't take it
anymore, he'd blend up

00:06:43.653 --> 00:06:48.575 position:50% align:center
the rest of his food and drink
it as a disgusting smoothie!

00:06:48.658 --> 00:06:50.118 position:50% align:center
So good!

00:06:50.201 --> 00:06:52.579 position:50% align:center
[GINA] And yet, this diet that
makes professional wrestlers

00:06:52.662 --> 00:06:55.665 position:50% align:center

her success! But how?

00:06:55.749 --> 00:06:57.584 position:50% align:center

comfort for strength

don't apply to you?

Well, it's not what
you'd call easy.

00:07:29.574 --> 00:07:32.577 position:50% align:center
It's even worse on gym days when
I work out before or after.

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:34.746 position:50% align:center
I mean, Silverman Gym's
fancy fees alone

00:07:34.829 --> 00:07:36.373 position:50% align:center
are pretty much wiping me out.

00:07:36.456 --> 00:07:37.957 position:50% align:center
And I can't even think
about what I'm spending

00:07:38.041 --> 00:07:39.626 position:50% align:center
on food without throwing up.

00:07:39.709 --> 00:07:42.962 position:50% align:center

00:07:50.512 --> 00:07:52.305 position:50% align:center
All you have to do is let
the school know you joined

00:07:52.389 --> 00:07:53.598 position:50% align:center
and they'll cover it.

00:07:53.682 --> 00:07:55.225 position:50% align:center
They'll take care of your
training fees, too!

00:07:55.308 --> 00:07:57.018 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Are you messin' with me?

00:07:57.102 --> 00:07:59.104 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI] My sister's chairman
of the board and she believes

00:07:59.187 --> 00:08:00.939 position:50% align:center
students should keep
learning off campus!

00:08:01.022 --> 00:08:02.607 position:50% align:center
So the school will
fund anything you do

00:08:02.691 --> 00:08:04.317 position:50% align:center
to increase your knowledge,
like weight training.

00:08:04.401 --> 00:08:07.112 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI] She got her sister to
fund her obsession. Respect.

00:08:07.195 --> 00:08:08.363 position:50% align:center
You don't have to pay.

00:08:08.446 --> 00:08:10.156 position:50% align:center
That qualifies as
extended education

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:11.783 position:50% align:center
and my sister will
take care of it!

00:08:11.866 --> 00:08:13.368 position:50% align:center
She must be loaded.

00:08:13.451 --> 00:08:16.204 position:50% align:center
It's not my business but how may
memberships are they paying for?

00:08:16.287 --> 00:08:20.000 position:50% align:center
Shut up, Hibiki.
It means... I'm free.

00:08:20.083 --> 00:08:21.960 position:50% align:center
Yes!

00:08:22.043 --> 00:08:24.879 position:50% align:center
I'm no longer a prisoner to
my own financial obligations!

00:08:24.963 --> 00:08:26.756 position:50% align:center
You'll still have to pay for
your own food, though.

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:28.883 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS] That's probably more
expensive than the gym!

00:08:28.967 --> 00:08:30.927 position:50% align:center
[AYAKA] But she'll see it
as a good cause.

00:08:31.011 --> 00:08:34.055 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] Suddenly,
all two of Hibiki's money woes

00:08:34.139 --> 00:08:36.182 position:50% align:center
came to an end.

00:08:38.059 --> 00:08:41.354 position:50% align:center
Now, please open your
textbooks to page ten.

00:08:41.438 --> 00:08:44.983 position:50% align:center
Today we'll study the rich and
fascinating cultures of Oceania.

00:08:45.066 --> 00:08:46.192 position:50% align:center
Oceania refers to...

00:08:46.276 --> 00:08:47.402 position:50% align:center
[GINA] This is the one
that goes to the gym

00:08:47.485 --> 00:08:49.863 position:50% align:center
with Hibiki and the other girls.

00:08:49.946 --> 00:08:51.948 position:50% align:center
[GINA] Strange. I've
never heard of a teacher

00:08:52.032 --> 00:08:53.992 position:50% align:center
hanging out with
students before.

00:08:54.075 --> 00:08:55.326 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:56.327 position:50% align:center
...Micronesia, as well
as the non-continental...

00:08:56.411 --> 00:08:58.121 position:50% align:center
[GINA]
That mole looks familiar.

00:08:58.204 --> 00:08:59.247 position:50% align:center
But I don't know why.

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:00.957 position:50% align:center
[TACHIBANA]
Before European contact...

00:09:01.041 --> 00:09:02.876 position:50% align:center
[GINA]
It can't be.

00:09:02.959 --> 00:09:04.210 position:50% align:center
[GINA gasping]

00:09:04.294 --> 00:09:07.005 position:50% align:center
[GINA] My stomach is
in knots. Is that her?

00:09:07.088 --> 00:09:09.257 position:50% align:center
[gasping]

00:09:09.341 --> 00:09:11.217 position:50% align:center
[TACHIBANA] All right,
who'd like to volunteer

00:09:11.301 --> 00:09:12.886 position:50% align:center
to read the first page for us?

00:09:12.969 --> 00:09:15.305 position:50% align:center
If no one raises their hand,
I'm gonna have to call on you.

00:09:15.388 --> 00:09:16.431 position:50% align:center
[GINA gasping]

00:09:16.514 --> 00:09:19.017 position:50% align:center
[GINA]
I knew it! I did recognize her!

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:21.019 position:50% align:center
She's Yulia Riko!

00:09:21.102 --> 00:09:24.230 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
Boom! I smell a scandal!

00:09:25.357 --> 00:09:26.399 position:50% align:center
[MACHIO]
There they are!

00:09:26.483 --> 00:09:27.817 position:50% align:center
You guys ready to
pump some iron today

00:09:27.901 --> 00:09:30.737 position:50% align:center
and feed those muscles so
you can be buff like me?

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:32.906 position:50% align:center
Hold on. Where's
Gina and Tachibana?

00:09:32.989 --> 00:09:34.032 position:50% align:center
They off today?

00:09:34.115 --> 00:09:35.825 position:50% align:center
Ms. Tachibana said
she had an important

00:09:35.909 --> 00:09:37.660 position:50% align:center
work meeting during
our gym time.

00:09:37.744 --> 00:09:38.995 position:50% align:center
That's weird.

00:09:39.079 --> 00:09:40.663 position:50% align:center
Gina said she had somewhere
to be this morning.

00:09:40.747 --> 00:09:42.916 position:50% align:center
I don't get how--
she's still new here.

00:09:42.999 --> 00:09:44.334 position:50% align:center
Oh, man. Guys.

00:09:44.417 --> 00:09:46.127 position:50% align:center
Do you think they made it
up so they could ditch us?

00:09:46.211 --> 00:09:48.463 position:50% align:center
Uh. Ms. Tachibana's, like, 40.

00:09:48.546 --> 00:09:51.716 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI] Age gap aside, what
would they even do together?

00:09:57.138 --> 00:09:58.390 position:50% align:center
[GINA]
Oh, yeah! That's great!

00:09:58.473 --> 00:09:59.974 position:50% align:center
Super <i>horosho</i> !

00:10:00.058 --> 00:10:03.103 position:50% align:center
Could you try another one with a
more somber expression, please?

00:10:03.186 --> 00:10:04.062 position:50% align:center
<i>Da</i> !

00:10:04.145 --> 00:10:05.772 position:50% align:center
[TACHIBANA]
Hurry. This hurts.

00:10:05.855 --> 00:10:07.941 position:50% align:center
Wow! So cool!

00:10:08.024 --> 00:10:10.235 position:50% align:center
Breathing the same air
as the real Yulia Riko

00:10:10.318 --> 00:10:11.653 position:50% align:center
makes my heart
bottom so grateful!

00:10:11.736 --> 00:10:12.862 position:50% align:center
[TACHIBANA]
Okay, that's enough.

00:10:12.946 --> 00:10:14.906 position:50% align:center
You need to keep
your voice down!

00:10:14.989 --> 00:10:18.618 position:50% align:center
[TACHIBANA]
Ugh. How did I let this happen?

00:10:18.702 --> 00:10:22.539 position:50% align:center
Ms. Tachibana, I know of
your secret identity.

00:10:22.622 --> 00:10:24.165 position:50% align:center
[TACHIBANA]
Huh? What? Hold on.

00:10:24.249 --> 00:10:25.375 position:50% align:center
Are you talking to me?

00:10:25.458 --> 00:10:26.710 position:50% align:center
[GINA]
Don't play dumb.

00:10:26.793 --> 00:10:28.795 position:50% align:center
You see that mole under her eye?

00:10:28.878 --> 00:10:30.839 position:50% align:center
It matches yours, doesn't it?

00:10:30.922 --> 00:10:32.298 position:50% align:center
And do you want to know why?

00:10:32.382 --> 00:10:34.009 position:50% align:center
Because you're the
real Yulia Riko,

00:10:34.092 --> 00:10:35.468 position:50% align:center
aren't you, Ms. Tachibana?

00:10:35.552 --> 00:10:37.971 position:50% align:center
[screams]

00:10:38.054 --> 00:10:41.016 position:50% align:center
[TACHIBANA] I'm gonna puke.
How did she find out?

00:10:41.099 --> 00:10:43.518 position:50% align:center
If she spreads my quasi-porno
cosplay pics around,

00:10:43.601 --> 00:10:45.353 position:50% align:center
my teaching career is over!

00:10:45.437 --> 00:10:48.940 position:50% align:center
I'll have to sell
cosplay prints!

00:10:49.024 --> 00:10:50.984 position:50% align:center
I'm begging you!
Please don't tell anyone!

00:10:51.067 --> 00:10:54.070 position:50% align:center
Promise you'll keep my secret!
I'll be your slave for life!

00:10:54.154 --> 00:10:56.698 position:50% align:center
I was never planning on
telling anybody anything,

00:10:56.781 --> 00:10:58.533 position:50% align:center
and that's kind of
an awkward offer.

00:10:58.616 --> 00:11:00.994 position:50% align:center
Anime and cosplayers are
my favorite subjects.

00:11:01.077 --> 00:11:02.454 position:50% align:center
I'm a big fan.

00:11:02.537 --> 00:11:04.497 position:50% align:center
I would never do something
to destroy your reputation.

00:11:04.581 --> 00:11:06.499 position:50% align:center
This isn't my first
stalker-rodeo!

00:11:06.583 --> 00:11:07.667 position:50% align:center
I'm not falling for that!

00:11:07.751 --> 00:11:09.461 position:50% align:center
Tell me your terms
and get it over with!

00:11:09.544 --> 00:11:11.212 position:50% align:center
I don't know how you had
to suffer to develop

00:11:11.296 --> 00:11:13.673 position:50% align:center
such a warped way of thinking,
but it's not my fault!

00:11:13.757 --> 00:11:16.593 position:50% align:center
But... Fine, if that's
that you need.

00:11:16.676 --> 00:11:19.804 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] And this is what
we call making your own bed

00:11:19.888 --> 00:11:23.058 position:50% align:center
and just... just rubbin' your
face and whatnots all over it!

00:11:23.141 --> 00:11:25.435 position:50% align:center
The next thing I think we
should do is go to Akihabara.

00:11:25.518 --> 00:11:27.354 position:50% align:center
And then we can go
to Macao tonight!

00:11:27.437 --> 00:11:29.314 position:50% align:center
We probably won't
have time for Macao.

00:11:29.397 --> 00:11:31.274 position:50% align:center
You know, since it's in China.

00:11:33.068 --> 00:11:34.569 position:50% align:center
[TACHIBANA]
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

00:11:34.652 --> 00:11:36.071 position:50% align:center
What's the matter?
Are you hurt?

00:11:36.154 --> 00:11:38.156 position:50% align:center
Huh? No, I'll be all right.

00:11:38.239 --> 00:11:39.866 position:50% align:center
Just a little sore, I guess

00:11:39.949 --> 00:11:41.409 position:50% align:center
I must've pushed myself too hard

00:11:41.493 --> 00:11:42.869 position:50% align:center
at the gym last time I was in,

00:11:42.952 --> 00:11:44.662 position:50% align:center
which was actually
three days ago now.

00:11:44.746 --> 00:11:46.331 position:50% align:center
Can't believe it still hurts.

00:11:46.414 --> 00:11:47.832 position:50% align:center
Spoilers!

00:11:47.916 --> 00:11:49.959 position:50% align:center
It takes your body a lot longer
to heal when you're older.

00:11:50.043 --> 00:11:51.294 position:50% align:center
Noted.

00:11:51.378 --> 00:11:53.588 position:50% align:center
So uh, is Akihabara very far?

00:11:53.672 --> 00:11:54.964 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't say so.

00:11:55.048 --> 00:11:56.716 position:50% align:center
You can get there
pretty quickly by train,

00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:57.967 position:50% align:center
or you could even walk.

00:11:58.051 --> 00:12:00.345 position:50% align:center
Great! Such a perfect
circumstance!

00:12:00.428 --> 00:12:02.972 position:50% align:center
We won't take the train then.
We can recover our strength

00:12:03.056 --> 00:12:06.685 position:50% align:center
by jogging there instead,
like active rest!

00:12:06.768 --> 00:12:09.896 position:50% align:center
Huh? How are we supposed
to recover by jogging?

00:12:09.979 --> 00:12:11.981 position:50% align:center
Wouldn't that just make
you more exhausted?

00:12:12.065 --> 00:12:14.901 position:50% align:center
After workouts,
how long do you recover?

00:12:14.984 --> 00:12:17.987 position:50% align:center
Do you tend to take many
days off complete with naps?

00:12:18.071 --> 00:12:18.822 position:50% align:center
Like this?

00:12:18.905 --> 00:12:19.823 position:50% align:center
[TACHIBANA]
It's true.

00:12:19.906 --> 00:12:22.242 position:50% align:center
I may take longer
naps than most.

00:12:22.325 --> 00:12:25.078 position:50% align:center
And yes, I'll forgive you for
the inaccuracy of this image.

00:12:25.161 --> 00:12:27.080 position:50% align:center
The point is that your
age doesn't matter.

00:12:27.163 --> 00:12:30.709 position:50% align:center
The longer you laze around, the
harder it is to fully recharge.

00:12:30.792 --> 00:12:32.127 position:50% align:center
I like peanut butter!

00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:33.753 position:50% align:center
[GINA]
Improving your blood circulation

00:12:33.837 --> 00:12:35.964 position:50% align:center
is an important part
of reducing fatigue.

00:12:36.047 --> 00:12:39.509 position:50% align:center
Blood is what spreads oxygen
throughout your body.

00:12:39.592 --> 00:12:41.219 position:50% align:center
Just doing light
exercise is enough

00:12:41.302 --> 00:12:43.471 position:50% align:center
to stimulate your
blood circulation,

00:12:43.555 --> 00:12:45.974 position:50% align:center
which is what I mean
when I say 'active rest.'

00:12:46.057 --> 00:12:48.101 position:50% align:center
You essentially
stimulate recovery.

00:12:48.184 --> 00:12:49.436 position:50% align:center
I get it.

00:12:49.519 --> 00:12:51.146 position:50% align:center
So that's what the whole
"jogging" thing was about?

00:12:51.229 --> 00:12:53.648 position:50% align:center
It doesn't have to be
jogging specifically.

00:12:53.732 --> 00:12:56.276 position:50% align:center
Walking, stretching, and even
some lightweight training

00:12:56.359 --> 00:12:58.486 position:50% align:center
will all give you
the same result!

00:12:58.570 --> 00:13:00.613 position:50% align:center
If you should decide
to do an active rest,

00:13:00.697 --> 00:13:02.532 position:50% align:center
here are two things to consider.

00:13:02.615 --> 00:13:04.534 position:50% align:center
First of all.

00:13:04.617 --> 00:13:08.329 position:50% align:center
Pace yourself and be careful
not to increase intensity.

00:13:08.413 --> 00:13:11.332 position:50% align:center
If you do too much,
it won't actually be rest.

00:13:13.543 --> 00:13:15.587 position:50% align:center
[GINA] The second thing is,
if you're sick or hurt,

00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:17.255 position:50% align:center
you need to do a passive rest.

00:13:17.339 --> 00:13:18.423 position:50% align:center
Relax completely.

00:13:18.506 --> 00:13:20.050 position:50% align:center
Don't push yourself
and allow your body

00:13:20.133 --> 00:13:22.010 position:50% align:center
to recover during sleep

00:13:22.093 --> 00:13:24.596 position:50% align:center
So that's how it all works.
What do you think?

00:13:24.679 --> 00:13:26.389 position:50% align:center
You ready to jog to Akihabara?

00:13:26.473 --> 00:13:28.016 position:50% align:center
[TACHIBANA]
Sounds good!

00:13:41.613 --> 00:13:42.614 position:50% align:center
[MACHIO grunts]

00:13:42.697 --> 00:13:44.824 position:50% align:center
[MACHIO]
Active rest and passive rest!

00:13:44.908 --> 00:13:47.827 position:50% align:center
Both have their benefits.
It all depends on how you feel!

00:13:47.911 --> 00:13:50.538 position:50% align:center
Seems like you're doing this
a lot more often lately!

00:13:50.622 --> 00:13:53.416 position:50% align:center
[TACHIBANA]
Okay, so this is active rest.

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:55.251 position:50% align:center
Make sure you don't
bounce too much.

00:13:55.335 --> 00:13:56.628 position:50% align:center
Just keep it light.

00:13:56.711 --> 00:13:59.255 position:50% align:center
Isn't it kinda pointless to
be jogging at this pace?

00:13:59.339 --> 00:14:01.591 position:50% align:center
I feel like I may as
well be walking here.

00:14:01.675 --> 00:14:04.469 position:50% align:center
[GINA] Of course not!
Actually, slower is better.

00:14:04.552 --> 00:14:07.347 position:50% align:center
Our goal right now is to feel
refreshed, not challenged.

00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:10.642 position:50% align:center
For a rough speed guideline, a
good pace to start with is one

00:14:10.725 --> 00:14:12.686 position:50% align:center
where you can still
have a conversation.

00:14:12.769 --> 00:14:14.479 position:50% align:center
[TACHIBANA]
I see!

00:14:14.562 --> 00:14:16.231 position:50% align:center
Well, here's a
conversation for you.

00:14:16.314 --> 00:14:18.483 position:50% align:center
Why do you want to go
to Akihabara so badly?

00:14:18.566 --> 00:14:20.568 position:50% align:center
You need some new electronics?

00:14:22.445 --> 00:14:24.197 position:50% align:center
[GINA]
Isn't it obvious?

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:28.284 position:50% align:center
Akihabara is known
for... famous idols.

00:14:28.368 --> 00:14:30.286 position:50% align:center
You mean, like, the singers?

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:33.456 position:50% align:center
[GINA] After I discovered anime,
I became obsessed with

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:35.709 position:50% align:center
cosplayers, bonsai trees,
kung-fu movies,

00:14:35.792 --> 00:14:37.168 position:50% align:center
yoga, and sushi.

00:14:37.252 --> 00:14:40.005 position:50% align:center
I fell in love with all the
things about your culture.

00:14:40.088 --> 00:14:42.882 position:50% align:center
Not everything you just listed
is from here, but that's cool.

00:14:42.966 --> 00:14:45.051 position:50% align:center
So, what I want to see
more than anything

00:14:45.135 --> 00:14:47.137 position:50% align:center
up close is an idol concert.

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:49.347 position:50% align:center
You don't actually have
to travel for that.

00:14:49.431 --> 00:14:51.975 position:50% align:center
I hear a lot of fans are using
the internet these days.

00:14:52.058 --> 00:14:54.102 position:50% align:center
But one of my favorites
is doing a show today

00:14:54.185 --> 00:14:55.437 position:50% align:center
at one of those stores.

00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:57.772 position:50% align:center
I really want to
see her perform,

00:14:57.856 --> 00:15:00.066 position:50% align:center
since I am her future rival.

00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:01.860 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, what?

00:15:01.943 --> 00:15:03.361 position:50% align:center
[GINA]
Ms. Tachibana?

00:15:03.445 --> 00:15:04.779 position:50% align:center
Are you listening?

00:15:04.863 --> 00:15:07.949 position:50% align:center
I came here with a specific
goal I intend to meet.

00:15:08.033 --> 00:15:10.827 position:50% align:center
It's not enough for me to
just watch them anymore.

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:13.371 position:50% align:center
I've decided I want
to be an idol myself.

00:15:13.455 --> 00:15:16.708 position:50% align:center
And I'll create a unit!
The strongest unit!

00:15:16.791 --> 00:15:18.585 position:50% align:center
And the best act there ever was!

00:15:18.668 --> 00:15:21.129 position:50% align:center
Why am I in your fantasy
group? That's not okay!

00:15:21.212 --> 00:15:23.006 position:50% align:center
Teachers suddenly forming
girl bands with students

00:15:23.089 --> 00:15:25.592 position:50% align:center
is a very bad idea! Surely
you can understand that?

00:15:25.675 --> 00:15:27.844 position:50% align:center
Don't worry about logistics,
we'll figure something out!

00:15:27.927 --> 00:15:29.304 position:50% align:center
[TACHIBANA]
No, we won't!

00:15:29.387 --> 00:15:32.057 position:50% align:center
Surprise! I actually signed
us all up for an audition

00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:33.892 position:50% align:center
next week, so it's
already in the works.

00:15:33.975 --> 00:15:35.477 position:50% align:center
No, I can't do it!

00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:39.272 position:50% align:center
This twist is way too abrupt
and no one else agreed to it!

00:15:39.356 --> 00:15:41.775 position:50% align:center
Believe me, I understand
how difficult this is.

00:15:41.858 --> 00:15:45.236 position:50% align:center
That's why you're going to
help me, right, Yulia Riko?

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:46.821 position:50% align:center
[TACHIBANA]
Huh...?

00:15:46.905 --> 00:15:47.697 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI]
Good job!

00:15:47.781 --> 00:15:48.990 position:50% align:center
Interesting...

00:15:49.074 --> 00:15:51.284 position:50% align:center
Things are getting
good around here.

00:15:51.368 --> 00:15:52.744 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI grunting]

00:16:02.212 --> 00:16:04.339 position:50% align:center
[KUTARO]
Another mediocre audition.

00:16:04.422 --> 00:16:05.965 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
This is the Director of the

00:16:06.049 --> 00:16:08.134 position:50% align:center
So Cool! Idol Auditions.

00:16:08.218 --> 00:16:10.261 position:50% align:center
His name: Kutaro Deire.

00:16:10.345 --> 00:16:12.305 position:50% align:center
[KUTARO] We've had nothing
but average-looking girls

00:16:12.389 --> 00:16:14.432 position:50% align:center
who sing and dance
on an average level,

00:16:14.516 --> 00:16:17.143 position:50% align:center
who'll likely achieve
mediocre popularity.

00:16:17.227 --> 00:16:19.062 position:50% align:center
They're forgettable,
a dime a dozen.

00:16:19.145 --> 00:16:20.730 position:50% align:center
And a waste of my time.

00:16:20.814 --> 00:16:24.818 position:50% align:center
I can't make a castle outta
crap, or an idol outta crap.

00:16:24.901 --> 00:16:27.362 position:50% align:center
Next please. Hurry up.

00:16:27.654 --> 00:16:30.198 position:50% align:center
[KUTARO] I'm tired of seeing
the same twin ding-a-ling act.

00:16:30.281 --> 00:16:32.534 position:50% align:center
I wanna see something
out of the damn box.

00:16:32.617 --> 00:16:33.660 position:50% align:center
Heh.

00:16:33.743 --> 00:16:35.453 position:50% align:center
[KUTARO]
Yeah right. Who am I kiddin'.

00:16:35.537 --> 00:16:38.039 position:50% align:center
Talent like that doesn't need
these cheeseball shows.

00:16:38.123 --> 00:16:39.416 position:50% align:center
Thanks, that was horrific!

00:16:39.499 --> 00:16:42.168 position:50% align:center
Let's get the next group
in here as soon as possible!

00:16:45.005 --> 00:16:47.841 position:50% align:center
Hello there! My name's
Gina, what's yours?

00:16:47.924 --> 00:16:48.967 position:50% align:center
[KUTARO]
Then again, there's such a thing

00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:50.343 position:50% align:center
as too unconventional!

00:16:50.427 --> 00:16:51.803 position:50% align:center
Thank you for having us!

00:16:51.886 --> 00:16:54.389 position:50% align:center
We're a group of friends who
work out at Silverman Gym!

00:16:54.472 --> 00:16:56.766 position:50% align:center
That's not all!
We brought assistants!

00:16:56.850 --> 00:16:57.851 position:50% align:center
Don't just sit there.

00:16:57.934 --> 00:17:00.562 position:50% align:center
Let's give these boys a hand!

00:17:00.645 --> 00:17:02.188 position:50% align:center
Even though we don't
really know them,

00:17:02.272 --> 00:17:04.107 position:50% align:center
they agreed to help
us out with this!

00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:05.233 position:50% align:center
[KUTARO]
For the love--!

00:17:05.316 --> 00:17:06.651 position:50% align:center
You couldn't bring
in dudes you know?!

00:17:06.735 --> 00:17:09.821 position:50% align:center
We are your next idol sensation!

00:17:09.904 --> 00:17:11.531 position:50% align:center
People call us The Muscle Girls!

00:17:11.614 --> 00:17:12.741 position:50% align:center
That's a dreadful name!

00:17:12.824 --> 00:17:15.368 position:50% align:center
Quit pelting me
with bad choices!

00:17:16.995 --> 00:17:18.371 position:50% align:center
[KUTARO]
Cheese and rice.

00:17:18.455 --> 00:17:20.874 position:50% align:center
I thought this audition day
was gonna be a wash.

00:17:20.957 --> 00:17:23.376 position:50% align:center
Then I got hit with
this strange talent bomb!

00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:25.378 position:50% align:center
[CROWD cheering]

00:17:25.462 --> 00:17:26.755 position:50% align:center
[KUTARO]
Who are they?

00:17:26.838 --> 00:17:29.174 position:50% align:center
And could they be the
bizarre and unexpected act

00:17:29.257 --> 00:17:30.842 position:50% align:center
I've been craving?

00:17:33.345 --> 00:17:36.306 position:50% align:center
[KUTARO] Yeah, hi, before
you show us your specialties,

00:17:36.389 --> 00:17:38.808 position:50% align:center
I just have a quick
question. Tell me.

00:17:38.892 --> 00:17:41.603 position:50% align:center
What's the symbolism of the
mask and why do you wear it?

00:17:41.686 --> 00:17:43.772 position:50% align:center
[TACHIBANA gasps]
Oh, hello.

00:17:43.855 --> 00:17:46.024 position:50% align:center
My name is Nunya
[bleep] Business.

00:17:46.107 --> 00:17:48.151 position:50% align:center
I keep my face hidden and
swing from chandeliers.

00:17:48.234 --> 00:17:49.486 position:50% align:center
These are the most
horrible names

00:17:49.569 --> 00:17:51.071 position:50% align:center
I've ever heard in my life!

00:17:51.154 --> 00:17:53.656 position:50% align:center
Why would someone who wants to
be famous not show their face?

00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:56.326 position:50% align:center
[TACHIBANA] Believe me, I'm not
out here because I want to be!

00:17:56.409 --> 00:17:58.036 position:50% align:center
I honestly didn't think
anyone would let us

00:17:58.119 --> 00:17:59.162 position:50% align:center
past the first round!

00:17:59.245 --> 00:18:00.789 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI] No way?
We gon' be famous!

00:18:00.872 --> 00:18:02.165 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI]
Sounds like fun!

00:18:02.248 --> 00:18:03.583 position:50% align:center
[AYAKA] It'll be a good
experience if nothing else!

00:18:03.667 --> 00:18:04.668 position:50% align:center
Were you even listening?!

00:18:04.751 --> 00:18:06.920 position:50% align:center
How are you all
on board with this?

00:18:07.003 --> 00:18:09.547 position:50% align:center
Whatever. I held up
my end of this deal.

00:18:09.631 --> 00:18:11.007 position:50% align:center
Hopefully I can fade
into the background

00:18:11.091 --> 00:18:12.967 position:50% align:center
and they'll just carry it.

00:18:13.051 --> 00:18:14.386 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS giggling]

00:18:14.469 --> 00:18:16.262 position:50% align:center
[KUTARO]
What the hell is wrong with me?

00:18:16.346 --> 00:18:18.098 position:50% align:center
Can't believe I'm
about to do this.

00:18:18.181 --> 00:18:21.726 position:50% align:center
Right. I might regret this
later, but for some sick reason

00:18:21.810 --> 00:18:23.687 position:50% align:center
I want to know what each
of your talents are.

00:18:23.770 --> 00:18:26.064 position:50% align:center
Ayaka and I both do
hand-to-hand combat!

00:18:26.147 --> 00:18:27.691 position:50% align:center
We're going to spar for you!

00:18:27.774 --> 00:18:30.402 position:50% align:center
We'll do the best bench
presses you've ever seen!

00:18:30.485 --> 00:18:31.736 position:50% align:center
[KUTARO]
That's great!

00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:34.155 position:50% align:center
And at what point were you
planning on singing?!

00:18:34.239 --> 00:18:35.573 position:50% align:center
[KUTARO]
Aw, forget it.

00:18:35.657 --> 00:18:37.784 position:50% align:center
The things kids do these days
to distract an audience

00:18:37.867 --> 00:18:40.662 position:50% align:center
from their lack of talent.
If it works, it works.

00:18:40.745 --> 00:18:43.081 position:50% align:center
I've seen some bizarre
acts on this stage.

00:18:49.546 --> 00:18:51.673 position:50% align:center

This is some brutal content!

00:18:54.259 --> 00:18:56.845 position:50% align:center

you take her down!

My frikkin nose is bleeding.

[panting]

00:19:01.808 --> 00:19:03.309 position:50% align:center
[KUTARO] That was the worst
idol act I've ever seen

00:19:03.393 --> 00:19:05.895 position:50% align:center
and this crowd is eating it up!

00:19:05.979 --> 00:19:09.733 position:50% align:center
And now, for our final act--
we give you, the deadlift!

00:19:09.816 --> 00:19:12.027 position:50% align:center
[TACHIBANA]
Oh, I'm the closing act? Great.

00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:13.403 position:50% align:center
A dead what...?

00:19:13.486 --> 00:19:15.155 position:50% align:center
What's happening with this show?

00:19:15.238 --> 00:19:17.282 position:50% align:center
[MACHIO]
It's called a deadlift.

00:19:19.242 --> 00:19:21.327 position:50% align:center
[MACHIO] One of the Big
Three in body building

00:19:21.411 --> 00:19:24.247 position:50% align:center
along with squats
and bench presses.

00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:26.124 position:50% align:center
Have you done your
deadlift today?

00:19:26.207 --> 00:19:28.710 position:50% align:center
[KUTARO]
This act is out of control.

00:19:28.793 --> 00:19:31.671 position:50% align:center
Take note. Deadlifts are
the hardest of those three.

00:19:31.755 --> 00:19:34.215 position:50% align:center
Do not attempt without
proper instruction.

00:19:34.299 --> 00:19:35.925 position:50% align:center
Correct form is essential.

00:19:36.009 --> 00:19:39.137 position:50% align:center
Without it, the spine and
lower back risk injury.

00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:41.890 position:50% align:center
And now you will witness this
dangerous move performed

00:19:41.973 --> 00:19:44.100 position:50% align:center
on this stage before
your very eyes.

00:19:44.184 --> 00:19:46.186 position:50% align:center
[KUTARO]
Can't you do that at the gym?

00:19:46.269 --> 00:19:48.855 position:50% align:center
[KUTARO] Who is this guy and
where did he come from?

00:19:48.938 --> 00:19:50.982 position:50% align:center
And where the hell
are his clothes?

00:19:54.944 --> 00:19:57.197 position:50% align:center
[TACHIBANA] Take a deep
breath and tighten your core

00:19:57.280 --> 00:20:01.701 position:50% align:center
for support. My grip of
choice is the mixed grip.

00:20:01.785 --> 00:20:03.119 position:50% align:center
[TACHIBANA grunts]

00:20:05.246 --> 00:20:06.873 position:50% align:center
[TACHIBANA]
Do not pull with your arms!

00:20:06.956 --> 00:20:08.708 position:50% align:center
Do not lift with your knees!

00:20:08.792 --> 00:20:13.421 position:50% align:center
Engage your back, your hips,
and hamstrings.

00:20:13.505 --> 00:20:16.549 position:50% align:center
Time to roast that lower back!

00:20:18.218 --> 00:20:20.136 position:50% align:center
[TACHIBANA grunts]

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:23.056 position:50% align:center
[TACHIBANA]
Deadlift, complete!

00:20:23.139 --> 00:20:25.809 position:50% align:center
[CROWD cheers]

00:20:26.476 --> 00:20:29.437 position:50% align:center
[gasping]

00:20:29.521 --> 00:20:32.524 position:50% align:center
Now that's a deadlift.
Nice job, Tachibana!

00:20:32.607 --> 00:20:35.902 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS]
Thank you so much, everybody!

00:20:35.985 --> 00:20:37.570 position:50% align:center
[TACHIBANA laughs]

00:20:37.654 --> 00:20:39.572 position:50% align:center
[AYAKA laughing]

00:20:39.656 --> 00:20:41.366 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI laughs]

00:20:41.449 --> 00:20:43.576 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI laughing]

00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:46.204 position:50% align:center
[GINA laughs]

00:20:52.961 --> 00:20:53.878 position:50% align:center
[KUTARO]
Heh...

00:20:54.963 --> 00:20:56.756 position:50% align:center
[KUTARO]
I don't know what just happened.

00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:58.174 position:50% align:center
Did they sing?

00:20:58.967 --> 00:21:01.386 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
They didn't make the cut.

00:21:01.469 --> 00:21:03.471 position:50% align:center
What a strange journey.

00:22:33.269 --> 00:22:35.188 position:50% align:center
Hey, guys! You shredded yet?

00:22:35.271 --> 00:22:37.023 position:50% align:center
Today we're doing
the lateral raise.

00:22:37.107 --> 00:22:38.191 position:50% align:center
Shred those shoulders!

00:22:38.274 --> 00:22:39.401 position:50% align:center
You can do these at home!

00:22:39.484 --> 00:22:41.611 position:50% align:center
Take a manageable
weight in each hand.

00:22:41.695 --> 00:22:43.279 position:50% align:center
Two one-liter bottles
filled with water

00:22:43.363 --> 00:22:45.532 position:50% align:center
should give you the perfect
amount of resistance.

00:22:45.615 --> 00:22:48.535 position:50% align:center
First, spread your feet
shoulder-width apart.

00:22:48.618 --> 00:22:50.995 position:50% align:center
Bend forward at the hips making
your back slant a bit.

00:22:51.079 --> 00:22:52.580 position:50% align:center
Nice form!

00:22:52.664 --> 00:22:55.041 position:50% align:center
Now keep your arms straight and
raise them slowly up and down.

00:22:55.125 --> 00:22:57.168 position:50% align:center
[TACHIBANA] Make sure you avoid
movement in your shoulder blades

00:22:57.252 --> 00:22:58.962 position:50% align:center
by keeping them
flexed and tight.

00:22:59.045 --> 00:23:00.755 position:50% align:center
You can also do this
one while seated.

00:23:00.839 --> 00:23:02.465 position:50% align:center
So get ready to lift with us.

00:23:02.549 --> 00:23:04.426 position:50% align:center
Today we're goin' for 20 reps!

00:23:04.509 --> 00:23:06.845 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
All right, let's get started!

00:23:06.928 --> 00:23:07.929 position:50% align:center
[MACHIO]
Here's One...

00:23:08.013 --> 00:23:09.347 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
Always be mindful of your form!

00:23:09.431 --> 00:23:12.392 position:50% align:center
Keep your breathing
consistent with your movement!

00:23:12.475 --> 00:23:15.228 position:50% align:center
You should start to feel a burn
in your shoulders about now.

00:23:15.311 --> 00:23:18.356 position:50% align:center
Lift just below the top of
the shoulder, then come down.

00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:22.277 position:50% align:center
Squeeze those shoulder blades to
avoid dislocation and tearing.

00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:26.990 position:50% align:center
Visualize the muscles you're
targeting. It helps isolation!

00:23:27.073 --> 00:23:28.658 position:50% align:center
Keep a consistent tempo!

00:23:28.742 --> 00:23:29.993 position:50% align:center
Almost there!

00:23:30.076 --> 00:23:31.953 position:50% align:center
Are you feelin' that burn, yet?

00:23:32.037 --> 00:23:33.997 position:50% align:center
Just a little bit more!

00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:36.583 position:50% align:center
...almost there! Twenty!

00:23:36.666 --> 00:23:38.001 position:50% align:center
We did it!

00:23:38.084 --> 00:23:39.836 position:50% align:center
Add this to your routine,
and your shoulders will be

00:23:39.919 --> 00:23:41.171 position:50% align:center
as cut as mine!

00:23:41.254 --> 00:23:42.589 position:50% align:center
And always remember, fam...

00:23:42.672 --> 00:23:44.758 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
True strength comes from within!

00:23:44.841 --> 00:23:47.635 position:50% align:center
If you want a bonus challenge,
continue doing this exercise

00:23:47.719 --> 00:23:49.429 position:50% align:center
for 15 more minutes
on your own.
