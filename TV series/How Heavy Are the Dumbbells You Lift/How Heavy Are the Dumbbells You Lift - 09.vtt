00:00:20.145 --> 00:00:22.188 position:50% align:center
What is going on?

00:00:24.065 --> 00:00:25.900 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] This is Narita
International Airport,

00:00:25.984 --> 00:00:28.820 position:50% align:center
and this is Immigration
Officer Sasurutaro Shin.

00:00:28.903 --> 00:00:30.405 position:50% align:center
You remember him.

00:00:30.488 --> 00:00:33.366 position:50% align:center
Well, today he's feeling a tad
nervous--shaken up, if you will.

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:34.617 position:50% align:center
Will you?

00:00:34.701 --> 00:00:36.578 position:50% align:center
[BARNOLD] I'm only staying
through tomorrow.

00:00:36.661 --> 00:00:38.830 position:50% align:center
Two days is long enough.

00:00:38.913 --> 00:00:41.374 position:50% align:center
Competition prep is
up to you, Jason.

00:00:41.458 --> 00:00:43.335 position:50% align:center
I've got someone to see.

00:00:43.418 --> 00:00:44.878 position:50% align:center
[JASON]
Yes, sir!

00:02:21.641 --> 00:02:23.727 position:50% align:center
Today we're going to work one
of the largest muscle groups

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.437 position:50% align:center
in your body... The back!

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.439 position:50% align:center
[ALL] I've been
looking forward to this!

00:02:27.522 --> 00:02:29.482 position:50% align:center
Hey. Is it just me
or does it feel like

00:02:29.566 --> 00:02:31.192 position:50% align:center
we're just skipping right
through the plot today?

00:02:31.276 --> 00:02:33.528 position:50% align:center

[MACHIO] ♪ Machi-oh-ohs
Muscle Lesson of the day! ♪

00:02:38.867 --> 00:02:41.494 position:50% align:center
It's me. Muscle Bro, Machio!

00:02:41.578 --> 00:02:42.871 position:50% align:center
When you look at your back,

00:02:42.954 --> 00:02:44.664 position:50% align:center
you'll notice three
different sections.

00:02:44.748 --> 00:02:46.833 position:50% align:center
The top portion is your
traps, next is lats,

00:02:46.916 --> 00:02:49.294 position:50% align:center
and the lower center
is the erector spinae.

00:02:49.377 --> 00:02:51.004 position:50% align:center
When you want to work
all three at once,

00:02:51.087 --> 00:02:53.506 position:50% align:center
the seated row machine
is an excellent option!

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.175 position:50% align:center
The push and pull
movement targets all

00:02:55.258 --> 00:02:56.676 position:50% align:center
three muscle groups
simultaneously,

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.262 position:50% align:center
resulting in a well-balanced
workout. This can also be

00:02:59.346 --> 00:03:01.765 position:50% align:center
a great warm-up exercise
by choosing a lighter weight.

00:03:01.848 --> 00:03:03.350 position:50% align:center
Squeeze your shoulder
blades together

00:03:03.433 --> 00:03:05.185 position:50% align:center
and pull the handle straight
toward your naval.

00:03:05.268 --> 00:03:06.311 position:50% align:center
Slowly return the handle

00:03:06.394 --> 00:03:08.355 position:50% align:center
and feel your blades
open up naturally.

00:03:08.438 --> 00:03:10.482 position:50% align:center
Avoid letting your body
sway in any direction

00:03:10.565 --> 00:03:12.192 position:50% align:center
so that you don't waste energy.

00:03:12.275 --> 00:03:15.028 position:50% align:center
Keep your core sturdy and
your back straight and strong.

00:03:15.111 --> 00:03:17.947 position:50% align:center
Use controlled movements
for a set of fifteen reps.

00:03:18.031 --> 00:03:19.074 position:50% align:center
If you're training at home,

00:03:19.157 --> 00:03:21.034 position:50% align:center
or if the machine's
in use at the gym,

00:03:21.117 --> 00:03:23.578 position:50% align:center
you can do back
extensions on a mat.

00:03:23.661 --> 00:03:24.996 position:50% align:center
Lie on your stomach
with your palms

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.498 position:50% align:center
on either side of your head.

00:03:26.581 --> 00:03:28.875 position:50% align:center
Gently lift your shoulders and
your legs up off the floor

00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:32.003 position:50% align:center
and then come back down slowly.

00:03:32.087 --> 00:03:34.631 position:50% align:center
Building strong back muscles
helps prevent stiff shoulders,

00:03:34.714 --> 00:03:37.842 position:50% align:center
headaches, bad posture
and even osteoporosis.

00:03:37.926 --> 00:03:39.886 position:50% align:center
Superset these moves
with ab exercises

00:03:39.969 --> 00:03:42.222 position:50% align:center
for a complete and
balanced workout.

00:03:42.305 --> 00:03:45.308 position:50% align:center
Like back extensions, there're
other moves you can do at home.

00:03:45.392 --> 00:03:46.768 position:50% align:center
Even if you can't
make it to the gym,

00:03:46.851 --> 00:03:48.311 position:50% align:center
you can still get
a good workout.

00:03:48.395 --> 00:03:49.562 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS]
Yeah!

00:03:49.646 --> 00:03:51.147 position:50% align:center
He's really good.

00:03:51.231 --> 00:03:53.483 position:50% align:center
It's like he knows exactly what
to say to make it make sense.

00:03:53.566 --> 00:03:54.818 position:50% align:center
I guess that's to be expected

00:03:54.901 --> 00:03:56.361 position:50% align:center
since he's been
doing it a while.

00:03:56.444 --> 00:03:59.614 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I think someone else here
told me the reason for that.

00:03:59.698 --> 00:04:01.408 position:50% align:center
Mr. Machio's apparently
more advanced

00:04:01.491 --> 00:04:03.326 position:50% align:center
because he went
to school overseas.

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:05.370 position:50% align:center
[TACHIBANA]
Really? Where exactly?

00:04:05.453 --> 00:04:07.372 position:50% align:center
[AYAKA] I heard he went to
an American university,

00:04:07.455 --> 00:04:08.957 position:50% align:center
so I guess that's where?

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.501 position:50% align:center
I think he was studying sports
theory or something like that.

00:04:11.584 --> 00:04:12.961 position:50% align:center
[MACHIO]
...and freestyle!

00:04:13.044 --> 00:04:14.713 position:50% align:center

But I get it.

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:20.135 position:50% align:center
He's gotta have some extensive
knowledge if he didn't

00:04:20.218 --> 00:04:22.387 position:50% align:center
sell his soul to create
a body like that.

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:23.805 position:50% align:center
[AYAKA]
Right?

00:04:23.888 --> 00:04:25.390 position:50% align:center
That means we must be getting
some top-shelf training.

00:05:36.336 --> 00:05:39.214 position:50% align:center
Kind of. He's in the

[GINA, AKEMI, TACHIBANA] Am I
supposed to know who that is?

00:05:51.059 --> 00:05:53.061 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI] He's an American
actor. But more than that...

00:05:53.144 --> 00:05:55.146 position:50% align:center
He was like a mascot
for action films in his day

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:56.398 position:50% align:center
and I've seen almost
all of 'em!

00:05:56.481 --> 00:05:57.774 position:50% align:center
[AYAKA]
He had a killer beast body

00:05:57.857 --> 00:05:59.484 position:50% align:center
and did some
clutch-A action movies,

00:05:59.567 --> 00:06:01.069 position:50% align:center
but he played good guys
most of the time.

00:06:01.152 --> 00:06:02.696 position:50% align:center
America was obsessed
with him first,

00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:04.197 position:50% align:center
and then the rest
of us caught on!

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:06.825 position:50% align:center
He's the star of some of
the best action movies ever!

What's wrong with you?

00:06:19.295 --> 00:06:21.506 position:50% align:center

00:06:21.589 --> 00:06:22.966 position:50% align:center
What about <i>Conan the Red Bull</i> ?

00:06:23.049 --> 00:06:24.551 position:50% align:center
Or <i>Twin Cops</i> , maybe?

Is this a prank?

00:06:26.386 --> 00:06:28.722 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI] So you're saying
he's a famous movie star,

00:06:28.805 --> 00:06:31.725 position:50% align:center
but only in America?
Why would he be in Japan?

00:06:31.808 --> 00:06:34.686 position:50% align:center
[GINA] No time for movies.
Only chess and ice skating.

See, I knew you'd remember!

00:06:40.692 --> 00:06:43.611 position:50% align:center
[TACHIBANA] It was the one where
you play a robot from the future

00:06:43.695 --> 00:06:46.489 position:50% align:center
and you fight and destroy
things to rescue a boy?

00:06:46.573 --> 00:06:48.450 position:50% align:center
And then you leave and say,
"I'll be back!"

[BOTH scream]

00:06:49.993 --> 00:06:53.288 position:50% align:center

I'm so frikkin sorry!

So, uh, were you and
Barnold friends in school?

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:04.924 position:50% align:center
How do you know each other?

00:07:05.008 --> 00:07:08.428 position:50% align:center
Right after high-school, I
went to college in America.

00:07:08.511 --> 00:07:10.847 position:50% align:center
I was studying
sports theory there.

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:13.558 position:50% align:center
That's when I was first
introduced to bodybuilding.

00:07:13.641 --> 00:07:16.269 position:50% align:center
Eventually, Mr. Shortsinator
here became

00:07:16.353 --> 00:07:18.563 position:50% align:center
my personal coach and
weight training mentor.

00:07:18.646 --> 00:07:21.024 position:50% align:center
Conan the Villain
was your mentor?

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:26.029 position:50% align:center
Why are you visiting me now?

00:07:26.112 --> 00:07:28.114 position:50% align:center
You never called me
once to say hello

00:07:28.198 --> 00:07:30.992 position:50% align:center
or ask how I was doing
after I graduated.

00:07:31.076 --> 00:07:33.745 position:50% align:center
Did you even care that
I went back to Japan?

00:07:33.828 --> 00:07:36.081 position:50% align:center
I am sorry you are
hurting, Naruzo.

00:07:36.164 --> 00:07:38.833 position:50% align:center
But believe me, there was
a reason for my absence.

00:07:38.917 --> 00:07:41.044 position:50% align:center
What reason could that be?

00:07:41.127 --> 00:07:44.422 position:50% align:center
[BARNOLD] I stored all your
information in my smart phone.

00:07:44.506 --> 00:07:46.966 position:50% align:center
And I dropped that
phone into a pool.

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:48.760 position:50% align:center

No!

00:07:48.843 --> 00:07:51.012 position:50% align:center

Aw, that sucks. Poor Barnie.

00:07:53.014 --> 00:07:54.307 position:50% align:center
But he didn't mean to ghost you!

00:07:54.391 --> 00:07:55.975 position:50% align:center
Why didn't you try
to contact Barnie

00:07:56.059 --> 00:07:57.435 position:50% align:center
after you hadn't heard from him?

00:07:57.519 --> 00:07:58.812 position:50% align:center
Yeah, good question.

00:07:58.895 --> 00:08:01.022 position:50% align:center
I was taking a mirror
selfie--like ya do--

00:08:01.106 --> 00:08:03.608 position:50% align:center
and I accidentally
crushed my phone.

00:08:03.692 --> 00:08:04.693 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
Wow!

00:08:04.776 --> 00:08:06.778 position:50% align:center
I can relate, man.
No worries at all.

00:08:06.861 --> 00:08:08.113 position:50% align:center
[TACHIBANA]
But can you, though?

00:08:08.196 --> 00:08:09.781 position:50% align:center
How common is it to accidentally
destroy your phone

00:08:09.864 --> 00:08:11.658 position:50% align:center
while taking flex shots?

00:08:11.741 --> 00:08:14.911 position:50% align:center
[BARNOLD] I only recently
figured out how to find you.

00:08:14.994 --> 00:08:17.580 position:50% align:center
I came across your photo
while checking out gyms

00:08:17.664 --> 00:08:19.541 position:50% align:center
with multiple branches.

00:08:19.624 --> 00:08:22.961 position:50% align:center
And you came all the way
out here just to see me?

00:08:23.044 --> 00:08:24.671 position:50% align:center
I'm honored, sir.

00:08:24.754 --> 00:08:26.464 position:50% align:center
No problemo.

00:08:26.548 --> 00:08:29.426 position:50% align:center
It's not a coincidence
that we've been reunited.

00:08:29.509 --> 00:08:31.302 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:08:31.386 --> 00:08:34.639 position:50% align:center
[BARNOLD] I believe this was
the work of the muscle gods.

00:08:34.723 --> 00:08:37.308 position:50% align:center
[gasps] It couldn't be!

00:08:37.392 --> 00:08:39.602 position:50% align:center
[TACHIBANA] Wait I want to know
more about the muscle gods!

00:08:39.686 --> 00:08:41.938 position:50% align:center
Should I ask? It'd probably
be rude to interrupt.

00:08:42.022 --> 00:08:44.190 position:50% align:center
Show me how you did it, Naruzo.

00:08:44.274 --> 00:08:46.359 position:50% align:center
After graduation,
what was your plan?

00:08:46.443 --> 00:08:48.486 position:50% align:center
I want to know all the ways
you managed to master

00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:50.697 position:50% align:center
the Art of the Muscles.

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:52.741 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:08:52.824 --> 00:08:54.576 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS gasp]

00:08:54.659 --> 00:08:57.454 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
Is that a frikkin hand grip?

00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:03.376 position:50% align:center
Does this look familiar?

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:04.711 position:50% align:center
Today we're going
to show you how

00:09:04.794 --> 00:09:06.588 position:50% align:center
to use handgrips
in your workouts.

00:09:06.671 --> 00:09:08.882 position:50% align:center
Lots of men like to use
them to increase the size

00:09:08.965 --> 00:09:11.092 position:50% align:center
of their forearms.
But as most women know,

00:09:11.176 --> 00:09:12.677 position:50% align:center
this tool helps to
strengthen your grip

00:09:12.761 --> 00:09:14.929 position:50% align:center
which comes in handy
for many reasons.

00:09:15.013 --> 00:09:17.015 position:50% align:center
[AYAKA] You can buy handgrips
at most sporting good stores

00:09:17.098 --> 00:09:19.559 position:50% align:center
or home improvement warehouses
in the tools section.

00:09:19.642 --> 00:09:20.852 position:50% align:center
The amount of
resistance varies,

00:09:20.935 --> 00:09:22.312 position:50% align:center
so if you're squeezing
on a level one,

00:09:22.395 --> 00:09:24.105 position:50% align:center
that's not gonna give you
much of a workout--

00:09:24.189 --> 00:09:26.066 position:50% align:center
unless you're like, a toddler.

00:09:26.149 --> 00:09:28.151 position:50% align:center
[GINA] Of course,
if the weight is too strong,

00:09:28.234 --> 00:09:31.654 position:50% align:center
and you can't even close
it once, there is no point.

00:09:31.738 --> 00:09:36.868 position:50% align:center
Also, the average grip strength
for 20-something men is 46--

00:09:36.951 --> 00:09:38.620 position:50% align:center
and that is in kilograms.

00:09:38.703 --> 00:09:41.873 position:50% align:center
The average for women
is 28 kilograms.

00:09:41.956 --> 00:09:43.249 position:50% align:center
[AYAKA]
Don't be a show off.

00:09:43.333 --> 00:09:44.793 position:50% align:center
Start with a weight
that you can close

00:09:44.876 --> 00:09:47.003 position:50% align:center
for a set of 10-to-15 reps.

00:09:47.087 --> 00:09:48.672 position:50% align:center
A manageable weight is a must

00:09:48.755 --> 00:09:52.133 position:50% align:center
when you're trying to
use up any excess energy.

00:09:52.217 --> 00:09:54.260 position:50% align:center
[GINA]
Using a grip is not hard.

00:09:54.344 --> 00:09:56.846 position:50% align:center
You squeeze it,
and then you let it go.

00:09:56.930 --> 00:09:59.140 position:50% align:center
Do it slowly or else
that's cheating.

00:09:59.224 --> 00:10:01.184 position:50% align:center
And that's the workout.

00:10:01.267 --> 00:10:05.146 position:50% align:center
Try to do three sets
of 15-to-20 repetitions.

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:07.065 position:50% align:center
[AYAKA] If you want a more
challenging variation

00:10:07.148 --> 00:10:08.483 position:50% align:center
of this exercise, choose a grip

00:10:08.566 --> 00:10:11.027 position:50% align:center
that you can only close
by using both hands.

00:10:11.111 --> 00:10:15.073 position:50% align:center
Once it's closed, hold it in one
hand and open the grip slowly.

00:10:15.156 --> 00:10:18.076 position:50% align:center
The muscles are targeted by
keeping the movement controlled.

00:10:18.159 --> 00:10:20.662 position:50% align:center
[GINA] Most people know that
grips help to train your forearm

00:10:20.745 --> 00:10:23.665 position:50% align:center
muscles and that stronger
forearms mean a stronger grip.

00:10:23.748 --> 00:10:26.084 position:50% align:center
If your grip is tight and
controlled, you can increase

00:10:26.167 --> 00:10:28.712 position:50% align:center
your overall training
performance in the gym!

00:10:28.795 --> 00:10:31.047 position:50% align:center
But did you know that using
a hand grip regularly

00:10:31.131 --> 00:10:33.383 position:50% align:center
also has benefits for
your everyday life--

00:10:33.466 --> 00:10:35.135 position:50% align:center
many of which will surprise you.

00:10:35.218 --> 00:10:37.220 position:50% align:center
It feels so good to watch
your strength come through

00:10:37.303 --> 00:10:39.139 position:50% align:center
right when you need it the most!

00:10:39.222 --> 00:10:41.641 position:50% align:center
[AYAKA] Treat that handgrip
like the squeezy miracle it is.

00:10:41.725 --> 00:10:44.519 position:50% align:center
[GINA] Your grip will
soon be strong as ox!

00:10:48.314 --> 00:10:51.359 position:50% align:center
The gripper you're holding has
the third strongest resistance

00:10:51.443 --> 00:10:54.904 position:50% align:center
in the world. Only about a
hundred people on the planet

00:10:54.988 --> 00:10:57.824 position:50% align:center
have been able to close
it using one hand.

00:11:00.452 --> 00:11:02.328 position:50% align:center
This is the perfect
opportunity for us

00:11:02.412 --> 00:11:04.080 position:50% align:center
to see your true strength.

00:11:04.164 --> 00:11:06.249 position:50% align:center
It's up to you
to decide, though.

00:11:06.332 --> 00:11:08.585 position:50% align:center
You gonna crush it or not?

00:11:08.668 --> 00:11:11.212 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir.

00:11:13.131 --> 00:11:15.383 position:50% align:center

met all the requirements!

00:11:34.569 --> 00:11:37.614 position:50% align:center
I'm sponsoring a bodybuilding
competition here in Japan.

00:11:37.697 --> 00:11:39.032 position:50% align:center
It starts tomorrow.

00:11:39.115 --> 00:11:41.368 position:50% align:center
Powerhouse men from all around
the world will compete,

00:11:41.451 --> 00:11:43.328 position:50% align:center
break records,
and shape history.

00:11:43.411 --> 00:11:44.996 position:50% align:center
Isn't that kinda short notice?

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:47.290 position:50% align:center
[BARNOLD] I want you to
compete as well, Naruzo.

00:11:47.374 --> 00:11:49.125 position:50% align:center
The time has finally come!

00:11:49.209 --> 00:11:54.005 position:50% align:center
The world must be made aware
of your shiny muscle power!

00:11:54.089 --> 00:11:56.758 position:50% align:center
Mr. Machio might be
a world champion!

00:11:56.841 --> 00:11:59.094 position:50% align:center
He's got no time to prepare!

00:11:59.177 --> 00:12:01.012 position:50% align:center
[TACHIBANA] I get that there's
a huge win up for grabs

00:12:01.096 --> 00:12:04.265 position:50% align:center
and that this is a big deal.
I still have to wonder...

00:12:04.349 --> 00:12:07.060 position:50% align:center
What does this have to
do with a hand gripper?

What's up?

00:12:46.558 --> 00:12:48.601 position:50% align:center
I've got this peaceful
feeling for some reason--

00:12:48.685 --> 00:12:50.895 position:50% align:center
like I've just come home.

00:12:50.979 --> 00:12:53.690 position:50% align:center
I mean, your house is in
this neighborhood, so...

00:12:53.773 --> 00:12:56.860 position:50% align:center

classes according to height.

Do you know how they
decide who the winner is?

00:14:18.692 --> 00:14:20.944 position:50% align:center
I thought "physique" and
bodybuilding competitions

00:14:21.027 --> 00:14:22.612 position:50% align:center
were one and the same.

00:14:22.696 --> 00:14:24.239 position:50% align:center
I'll explain everything.

00:14:24.322 --> 00:14:27.117 position:50% align:center
I know it's a lot to
take in so last-minute.

But I've got you, little
Japanese-Russian geisha girls.

00:14:30.537 --> 00:14:31.746 position:50% align:center
I could be wrong.

But I have a feeling he's
misusing that word.

knows we're not in China.

00:14:40.046 --> 00:14:42.048 position:50% align:center
[BARNOLD] Physique and
Bodybuilding competitions have

00:14:42.132 --> 00:14:44.843 position:50% align:center
very different judging criteria.

00:14:44.926 --> 00:14:47.554 position:50% align:center
A physique contestant builds
a slender V-shaped body

00:14:47.637 --> 00:14:52.726 position:50% align:center
and gains points on face, hair,
and wardrobe choice and design.

00:14:52.809 --> 00:14:54.936 position:50% align:center
One major difference
is that the lower body

00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:58.148 position:50% align:center
is hardly ever judged
in a physique show.

00:14:58.231 --> 00:15:00.650 position:50% align:center
Bodybuilders score points
for specific poses

00:15:00.734 --> 00:15:03.486 position:50% align:center
for the whole body
at every competition.

00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:06.865 position:50% align:center
Go ahead and look
close at the stage.

00:15:06.948 --> 00:15:08.742 position:50% align:center
This is called the relaxed pose.

00:15:08.825 --> 00:15:11.828 position:50% align:center
From there, they'll do
their mandatory poses.

00:15:13.371 --> 00:15:16.082 position:50% align:center
[BARNOLD]
We've got front double biceps.

00:15:17.625 --> 00:15:19.461 position:50% align:center
[BARNOLD]
That's a front lat spread.

00:15:21.504 --> 00:15:25.425 position:50% align:center
[BARNOLD]
This is the side chest.

00:15:25.508 --> 00:15:27.552 position:50% align:center
Back double biceps.

00:15:30.305 --> 00:15:32.307 position:50% align:center
[BARNOLD]
Here's a back lat spread.

00:15:34.893 --> 00:15:36.770 position:50% align:center
[BARNOLD]
Triceps pose!

00:15:38.855 --> 00:15:41.524 position:50% align:center
[BARNOLD]
And abdominal and thigh pose.

00:15:42.692 --> 00:15:44.736 position:50% align:center
Those are the standard poses.

00:15:44.819 --> 00:15:47.822 position:50% align:center
In addition to these, some
organizations will also include

00:15:47.906 --> 00:15:49.616 position:50% align:center
the "Most Muscular" pose.

00:15:49.699 --> 00:15:52.202 position:50% align:center
Mr. Machio does these
poses all the time!

00:15:52.285 --> 00:15:53.661 position:50% align:center
That's it?

00:15:53.745 --> 00:15:55.830 position:50% align:center
I thought there was going
to be music and more poses.

00:15:55.914 --> 00:15:58.166 position:50% align:center
Like he said, these are
just the standard ones.

00:15:58.249 --> 00:16:00.460 position:50% align:center
[BARNOLD] You're thinking
of the final rounds.

00:16:00.543 --> 00:16:03.254 position:50% align:center
Each finalist performs
a freestyle routine

00:16:03.338 --> 00:16:05.340 position:50% align:center
of their most impressive poses

00:16:05.423 --> 00:16:07.759 position:50% align:center
in time with the musical
piece of their choice.

00:16:07.842 --> 00:16:08.968 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI]
You get to learn a little about

00:16:09.052 --> 00:16:10.345 position:50% align:center
their personalities!

00:16:10.428 --> 00:16:12.972 position:50% align:center
After the freestyle
comes the Pose Down.

00:16:13.056 --> 00:16:14.849 position:50% align:center
This is the final round.

00:16:14.933 --> 00:16:17.644 position:50% align:center
The finalists will all be
asked to do the same pose

00:16:17.727 --> 00:16:20.021 position:50% align:center
and be compared until
a winner is decided.

00:16:20.105 --> 00:16:22.357 position:50% align:center
[JASON]
Front double biceps!

00:16:24.109 --> 00:16:29.989 position:50% align:center
[JASON] Okay, and relax.
Front lat spread!

00:16:30.073 --> 00:16:31.157 position:50% align:center
Shred it hard, guys!

00:16:31.241 --> 00:16:32.033 position:50% align:center
You're huge!

00:16:32.117 --> 00:16:33.243 position:50% align:center
Look at those abs!

00:16:33.326 --> 00:16:34.494 position:50% align:center
Don't forget to smile!

00:16:34.577 --> 00:16:36.162 position:50% align:center
My daddy's so cool!

00:16:36.246 --> 00:16:37.455 position:50% align:center
Go, Number 11!

00:16:37.539 --> 00:16:38.581 position:50% align:center
Go, 15!

00:16:38.665 --> 00:16:40.625 position:50% align:center
Show me those pecs, 18!

00:16:40.709 --> 00:16:42.669 position:50% align:center
That crowd! Omigosh!

00:16:42.752 --> 00:16:44.963 position:50% align:center
That old dude loves some pecs!

00:16:45.046 --> 00:16:46.840 position:50% align:center
The pose down is
the most exciting part

00:16:46.923 --> 00:16:48.883 position:50% align:center
of the competition
for most viewers.

00:16:48.967 --> 00:16:52.012 position:50% align:center
Wow! I get it!

00:16:52.095 --> 00:16:54.180 position:50% align:center
[ATTENDEES gasping]

00:16:55.724 --> 00:17:00.061 position:50% align:center
[BARNOLD] Oh, watch this.
It's the 180-plus class.

00:17:00.145 --> 00:17:02.230 position:50% align:center
Man, those are gigan-tor!

00:17:02.313 --> 00:17:04.899 position:50% align:center
Hang on! Why are those
guys at the front?

00:17:04.983 --> 00:17:07.444 position:50% align:center
[BARNOLD] There're a lot of
contestants in this class.

00:17:07.527 --> 00:17:09.946 position:50% align:center
They've been divided into groups
so that they can all be seen

00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:11.573 position:50% align:center
and judged equally.

00:17:11.656 --> 00:17:13.241 position:50% align:center
[AUDIENCE 09E]
Those abs are grenades!

00:17:13.324 --> 00:17:14.784 position:50% align:center
[AUDIENCE 09F]
I'm gonna hike up those biceps!

00:17:14.868 --> 00:17:16.286 position:50% align:center
[AUDIENCE 09G]
Melons for shoulders!

00:17:16.369 --> 00:17:17.996 position:50% align:center
--They all look amazing!
--[AKEMI] Big muscle.

00:17:18.079 --> 00:17:19.956 position:50% align:center
--Like real-life works of art!
--Must bite it. Must chew arm.

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:21.916 position:50% align:center
[AYAKA] I guess I didn't expect
there to be this many men

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.460 position:50% align:center
in the audience!

00:17:23.543 --> 00:17:26.379 position:50% align:center
But like, how do you decide
whose huge muscles are better?

00:17:26.463 --> 00:17:29.841 position:50% align:center
[BARNOLD grunts] I can
see how it's hard to tell.

00:17:29.924 --> 00:17:32.969 position:50% align:center
It's not just about
the muscle size.

00:17:33.053 --> 00:17:35.305 position:50% align:center
They look at overall
muscle balance,

00:17:35.388 --> 00:17:38.725 position:50% align:center
how well the body oil is
applied, and of course,

00:17:38.808 --> 00:17:41.019 position:50% align:center
how beautiful the poses are.

00:17:41.102 --> 00:17:44.481 position:50% align:center
That's the basic recipe
for body building victory!

00:17:44.564 --> 00:17:45.940 position:50% align:center
Yeah!

00:17:46.024 --> 00:17:48.568 position:50% align:center
Cool! So there's more to it
than just building muscle!

00:17:48.651 --> 00:17:50.570 position:50% align:center
Look! There's Mr. Machio!

00:17:50.653 --> 00:17:54.449 position:50% align:center
[JASON] Will the next group
please step forward for viewing?

00:17:54.532 --> 00:17:56.242 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
Huh? Oh, hi!

00:17:56.326 --> 00:17:57.452 position:50% align:center
It's getting real.

00:17:57.535 --> 00:17:59.454 position:50% align:center
Every person in that
audience would later say

00:17:59.537 --> 00:18:03.166 position:50% align:center
that they felt the presence
of an actual god.

00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:11.257 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] Oh. And now,
that makes total sense!

00:18:18.348 --> 00:18:20.016 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS gasping]

00:18:21.643 --> 00:18:22.852 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:18:22.936 --> 00:18:24.145 position:50% align:center
What's happening?

00:18:24.229 --> 00:18:25.772 position:50% align:center
Something's going on
with my clothes!

00:18:25.855 --> 00:18:27.857 position:50% align:center
[gasping]

00:18:27.941 --> 00:18:30.527 position:50% align:center
[BARNOLD] He's using
the force of his muscles.

00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:35.865 position:50% align:center
So, Naruzo, this is what you've
been up to over the years?

00:18:35.949 --> 00:18:37.158 position:50% align:center
No more muscle.

00:18:37.242 --> 00:18:38.410 position:50% align:center
No more muscle!

00:18:38.493 --> 00:18:40.161 position:50% align:center
No more muscle...

00:18:40.245 --> 00:18:41.705 position:50% align:center
Are they scared?

00:18:46.251 --> 00:18:47.669 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI]
Look at the contestants!

00:18:47.752 --> 00:18:50.255 position:50% align:center
They're kneeling down
before Mr. Machio!

00:18:50.338 --> 00:18:52.841 position:50% align:center
That must mean he won!

00:18:52.924 --> 00:18:54.926 position:50% align:center
[TACHIBANA] I can't imagine what
that last scene looked like

00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:57.387 position:50% align:center
for someone watching
out of context.

00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:02.684 position:50% align:center
Congrats on your
victory, Naruzo.

00:19:02.767 --> 00:19:05.687 position:50% align:center
To think you defeated so
many veterans, last minute,

00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:07.647 position:50% align:center
without ever breaking a sweat.

00:19:07.731 --> 00:19:10.483 position:50% align:center
The young samurai I knew
really has grown up.

00:19:10.567 --> 00:19:12.777 position:50% align:center
Thanks, that means a lot to me.

00:19:12.861 --> 00:19:14.571 position:50% align:center
I had a really great time today.

00:19:14.654 --> 00:19:16.740 position:50% align:center
Those guys were the
best of the best.

00:19:16.823 --> 00:19:21.077 position:50% align:center
Although... I'm only measuring
that on a very small ruler.

00:19:21.161 --> 00:19:23.663 position:50% align:center
You didn't think I would notice
that none of the international

00:19:23.747 --> 00:19:26.082 position:50% align:center
champs I know were
on that stage tonight?

00:19:26.166 --> 00:19:27.542 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:19:27.625 --> 00:19:29.502 position:50% align:center
[MACHIO] That means
the competition itself

00:19:29.586 --> 00:19:32.922 position:50% align:center
was yet another test.
Tell me I'm wrong.

00:19:33.006 --> 00:19:34.758 position:50% align:center
You're right!

00:19:34.841 --> 00:19:38.303 position:50% align:center
Congratulations, you
passed your second test!

00:19:38.386 --> 00:19:41.306 position:50% align:center
[grunting]

00:19:41.389 --> 00:19:43.808 position:50% align:center
[BARNOLD] Why do you think I've
been training so many students

00:19:43.892 --> 00:19:47.145 position:50% align:center
up until this point? I wanted
to create a bodybuilder

00:19:47.228 --> 00:19:50.482 position:50% align:center
who was capable of competing
with me as an equal!

00:19:50.565 --> 00:19:55.153 position:50% align:center
Our final showdown will be
nowhere else but Las Vegas!

00:19:55.236 --> 00:19:57.864 position:50% align:center
I'll be ready for you, Naruzo!

00:19:57.947 --> 00:19:59.491 position:50% align:center
Ah, sorry, I can't.

00:19:59.574 --> 00:20:02.327 position:50% align:center
I've gotta work, so I can't
just fly to America.

00:20:02.410 --> 00:20:05.288 position:50% align:center
I've got clients who depend
on me as their trainer.

00:20:05.372 --> 00:20:08.333 position:50% align:center
[BARNOLD]
Oh, never mind then.

00:20:08.416 --> 00:20:09.626 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
Work ethic, kids!

00:20:09.709 --> 00:20:11.920 position:50% align:center
That's how you grow
big and strong!

00:20:14.214 --> 00:20:15.382 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
You did it!

00:20:15.465 --> 00:20:17.050 position:50% align:center
Congrats, Mr. Machio!

00:20:17.133 --> 00:20:19.052 position:50% align:center
Thank you very muscle!

00:20:19.135 --> 00:20:23.056 position:50% align:center
Hey, Machio, what do you say
we hustle some muscle today?

00:20:23.139 --> 00:20:24.724 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Let's hustle some muscle!

00:20:24.808 --> 00:20:26.893 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI] What the--
Who's that guy with him?

00:20:26.976 --> 00:20:29.437 position:50% align:center
[JASON] I haven't properly
introduced myself yet.

00:20:29.521 --> 00:20:32.774 position:50% align:center
I work as Sir Shortsinator's
private secretary.

00:20:32.857 --> 00:20:35.068 position:50% align:center
My full name is Jason Sgatham.

00:20:35.151 --> 00:20:37.821 position:50% align:center
Dude you're in your underwear,
you don't have to be so formal.

00:20:37.904 --> 00:20:40.824 position:50% align:center
Actually, I didn't know
that about you, man.

00:20:40.907 --> 00:20:43.243 position:50% align:center
I stayed in Japan under
his direct order.

00:20:43.326 --> 00:20:47.288 position:50% align:center
And one of my major assignments
was to support young Naruzo's

00:20:47.372 --> 00:20:50.083 position:50% align:center
training program
with my assistance.

00:20:50.166 --> 00:20:52.377 position:50% align:center
[GROUP gasps]

00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:53.837 position:50% align:center
Please don't worry about me!

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:56.214 position:50% align:center
I'm content to blend in
with the rest of the extras

00:20:56.297 --> 00:20:57.549 position:50% align:center
when I'm not needed!

00:20:57.632 --> 00:20:59.467 position:50% align:center
Oh, so you're not even
gonna make an effort?

00:20:59.551 --> 00:21:01.636 position:50% align:center
Naruzo and friends! Listen up!

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:03.847 position:50% align:center
Get out there and
hustle those muscles!

00:21:03.930 --> 00:21:05.724 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI] Quit trying to make
"hustle muscle" happen!

00:21:05.807 --> 00:21:08.768 position:50% align:center
It sucks! If you're gonna be
an extra, you can't talk!

00:21:08.852 --> 00:21:10.186 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
And just like that,

00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:12.981 position:50% align:center
the gym got a
strange new member.

00:22:43.405 --> 00:22:45.323 position:50% align:center
Today we've been
working on our backs.

00:22:45.407 --> 00:22:48.118 position:50% align:center
So let's start with...
back extensions!

00:22:48.201 --> 00:22:50.829 position:50% align:center
Lie on your stomach and
bend your body upwards.

00:22:50.912 --> 00:22:52.956 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI] Squeeze your rear
to support your spine

00:22:53.039 --> 00:22:55.458 position:50% align:center
as you raise and lower
your arms and legs.

00:22:55.542 --> 00:22:58.253 position:50% align:center
When you come up, only aim to
get your chest off the ground.

00:22:58.336 --> 00:23:01.214 position:50% align:center
Pushing too hard
can cause injury.

00:23:01.297 --> 00:23:03.591 position:50% align:center
This exercise is great
when you do it right.

00:23:03.675 --> 00:23:06.511 position:50% align:center
You'll work out your thighs
and glutes with your back.

00:23:06.594 --> 00:23:07.762 position:50% align:center
[TACHIBANA]
When you lift up,

00:23:07.846 --> 00:23:10.890 position:50% align:center
hold for a few seconds
before coming back down.

00:23:10.974 --> 00:23:12.267 position:50% align:center
Your goal is ten reps!

00:23:12.350 --> 00:23:15.520 position:50% align:center
If you're ready... Let's do it!

00:23:15.603 --> 00:23:19.858 position:50% align:center
Here's one, and two...

00:23:19.941 --> 00:23:24.279 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI] Inhale up, and
exhale coming down.

00:23:24.362 --> 00:23:26.448 position:50% align:center
Make sure you're not
holding your breath!

00:23:26.531 --> 00:23:28.783 position:50% align:center
...now six, and seven...

00:23:28.867 --> 00:23:32.662 position:50% align:center
[AYAKA] This is a great rhythm!
Don't change the pace!

00:23:32.746 --> 00:23:36.207 position:50% align:center
Stay controlled so you
don't lose your balance.
