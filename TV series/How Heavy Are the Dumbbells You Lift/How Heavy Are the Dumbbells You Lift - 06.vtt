for your visit?

00:00:34.868 --> 00:00:36.619 position:50% align:center

Man. Now that is a sweet rig.

00:00:47.213 --> 00:00:48.631 position:50% align:center
Why couldn't I have
been born rich?

00:00:48.715 --> 00:00:51.593 position:50% align:center
Then I could turn my entire
place into a movie theatre!

00:00:51.676 --> 00:00:53.928 position:50% align:center
And I would be so popular!

00:00:54.012 --> 00:00:56.598 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI sighs]
It's crazy expensive.

00:00:56.681 --> 00:00:58.850 position:50% align:center
Wish I didn't already spend
my entire paycheck on food

00:00:58.933 --> 00:01:00.560 position:50% align:center
and a gym membership.

00:01:00.643 --> 00:01:01.770 position:50% align:center
Oh, well.

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.817 position:50% align:center
That's kinda random.

Mr. Machio!

00:02:53.757 --> 00:02:54.632 position:50% align:center
Hey!

00:02:54.716 --> 00:02:56.134 position:50% align:center
Question about arm wrestling.

00:02:56.217 --> 00:02:57.927 position:50% align:center
Is it the same rules
as Arm Sumo?

00:02:58.011 --> 00:03:00.263 position:50% align:center
[MACHIO] Are you interested in
signing up for the tournament?

00:03:00.347 --> 00:03:02.557 position:50% align:center
As for the exact rules,
those were defined by

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:03.850 position:50% align:center
the World Arm
Wrestling Federation.

00:03:03.933 --> 00:03:05.185 position:50% align:center
You can look 'em up online.

00:03:05.268 --> 00:03:07.604 position:50% align:center
They also host the world
championships every year.

00:03:07.687 --> 00:03:09.731 position:50% align:center
The biggest difference between
the two is the tables

00:03:09.814 --> 00:03:12.650 position:50% align:center
they're played on. The rules
vary slightly as well.

00:03:12.734 --> 00:03:14.194 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
Huh?

00:03:14.277 --> 00:03:15.236 position:50% align:center
[MACHIO]
Even though this tournament

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:16.863 position:50% align:center
is just for Silverman
Gym members,

00:03:16.946 --> 00:03:18.615 position:50% align:center
we will be playing by
the official rules used

00:03:18.698 --> 00:03:20.700 position:50% align:center
in the world-wide competitions.

00:03:20.784 --> 00:03:22.869 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI] Does that mean
you're gonna be competing?

00:03:22.952 --> 00:03:24.537 position:50% align:center
[MACHIO]
Nah, trainers are much better

00:03:24.621 --> 00:03:25.830 position:50% align:center
cheerleaders than players.

00:03:25.914 --> 00:03:27.624 position:50% align:center
I can still see you,
don't quit yet!

00:03:27.707 --> 00:03:29.501 position:50% align:center
You can rest if you need to,
but finish it out!

00:03:29.584 --> 00:03:30.669 position:50% align:center
[TACHIBANA]
Can you please get distracted

00:03:30.752 --> 00:03:32.545 position:50% align:center
by the cute young blonde
and forget I exist

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:34.547 position:50% align:center
for a minute like
a normal guy?

00:03:34.631 --> 00:03:36.424 position:50% align:center
Anyway, why don't
you guys enter?

00:03:36.508 --> 00:03:37.676 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:38.385 position:50% align:center
[MACHIO] We don't have
enough people signed up

00:03:38.468 --> 00:03:39.469 position:50% align:center
in the women's division.

00:03:39.552 --> 00:03:40.762 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:03:40.845 --> 00:03:42.347 position:50% align:center
Don't you think that sounds fun?

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.100 position:50% align:center
I mean. I think prize
money sounds fun.

00:03:45.183 --> 00:03:46.518 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
That's right. If I win,

00:03:46.601 --> 00:03:48.728 position:50% align:center
I could give that home
theatre set a better life.

00:03:48.812 --> 00:03:51.690 position:50% align:center
Umm. I don't even know
the basic rules, though.

00:03:51.773 --> 00:03:52.774 position:50% align:center
What she said.

00:03:52.857 --> 00:03:54.609 position:50% align:center
I've watched it before,
but that's all.

00:03:54.693 --> 00:03:55.860 position:50% align:center
No problem!

00:03:55.944 --> 00:03:59.489 position:50% align:center
I've got everything I
need to teach you here.

00:03:59.572 --> 00:04:00.865 position:50% align:center
I figured you'd be curious.

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:03.535 position:50% align:center
So I already set up a table
for us to practice on!

00:04:03.618 --> 00:04:04.869 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
How convenient.

00:04:04.953 --> 00:04:07.163 position:50% align:center
Did he accidentally already
sign us up as well?

[MACHIO] ♪ Machi-oh-ohs
Muscle Lesson of the day! ♪

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:15.005 position:50% align:center
It's me, Muscle Bro, Machio!

00:04:15.088 --> 00:04:16.798 position:50% align:center
Today I'm going to show
you the correct way

00:04:16.881 --> 00:04:18.842 position:50% align:center
to arm wrestle like
a professional!

00:04:18.925 --> 00:04:21.177 position:50% align:center
First of all, do you know
which muscles we use

00:04:21.261 --> 00:04:22.721 position:50% align:center
for arm wrestling?

00:04:22.804 --> 00:04:24.973 position:50% align:center
Most assume it's just
the biceps and triceps,

00:04:25.056 --> 00:04:28.101 position:50% align:center
and we do use those,
but not exclusively.

00:04:28.184 --> 00:04:30.103 position:50% align:center
You also use your forearms,

00:04:30.186 --> 00:04:33.565 position:50% align:center
a group of shoulder muscles
called the rotator cuff,

00:04:33.648 --> 00:04:37.527 position:50% align:center
your back muscles,
and even your entire lower body.

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:39.070 position:50% align:center
In other words...

00:04:39.154 --> 00:04:41.990 position:50% align:center
Arm wrestling is a sport that
requires full-body strength!

00:04:42.073 --> 00:04:44.617 position:50% align:center
Start by gripping the peg
with your non-dominant hand.

00:04:44.701 --> 00:04:47.495 position:50% align:center
Place your elbow on the pad,
keep your shoulders parallel

00:04:47.579 --> 00:04:49.956 position:50% align:center
making sure your elbow
centered with your body.

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.332 position:50% align:center
Press your stomach to the table,

00:04:51.416 --> 00:04:53.126 position:50% align:center
and lean into the leg
that's on the same side

00:04:53.209 --> 00:04:54.336 position:50% align:center
as the arm you're
competing with!

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:56.463 position:50% align:center
Using proper form
allows you to access all

00:04:56.546 --> 00:04:58.631 position:50% align:center
your body's strength
more effectively.

00:04:58.715 --> 00:05:00.884 position:50% align:center
It also gives you an immediate
advantage over someone

00:05:00.967 --> 00:05:03.386 position:50% align:center
who is relying solely
on their arm muscles.

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:05.263 position:50% align:center
Even after your body
is in position,

00:05:05.347 --> 00:05:08.391 position:50% align:center
you don't use your arm
strength alone to compete.

00:05:08.475 --> 00:05:09.642 position:50% align:center
Use your back and core

00:05:09.726 --> 00:05:12.145 position:50% align:center
to support your arm
as you win your fight!

00:05:12.228 --> 00:05:14.022 position:50% align:center
Also, don't take your
eyes off your hand

00:05:14.105 --> 00:05:16.441 position:50% align:center
until the ref has declared
the match officially over.

00:05:16.524 --> 00:05:19.069 position:50% align:center
You could lose your balance
and become injured.

00:05:19.152 --> 00:05:21.237 position:50% align:center
As you can see, the simple
sport of arm wrestling

00:05:21.321 --> 00:05:22.989 position:50% align:center
is actually very complex.

00:05:23.073 --> 00:05:25.075 position:50% align:center
Do you think you're up
for the challenge?

00:05:25.158 --> 00:05:26.618 position:50% align:center
If you're interested at all,

00:05:26.701 --> 00:05:29.162 position:50% align:center
there are several different
exercises to train and build up

00:05:29.245 --> 00:05:31.373 position:50% align:center
those specific muscles
here at the gym.

00:05:31.456 --> 00:05:34.250 position:50% align:center
But the best way to improve
overall is by practicing.

00:05:34.334 --> 00:05:35.585 position:50% align:center
There are some arm wrestlers

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:37.504 position:50% align:center
who don't ever do
any strength training.

00:05:37.587 --> 00:05:39.631 position:50% align:center
How about it Miss Sakura
and Miss Uehara.

00:05:39.714 --> 00:05:42.008 position:50% align:center
--[AYAKA] What?
--Give it a shot?

00:05:42.092 --> 00:05:43.343 position:50% align:center
So, yeah.

00:05:43.426 --> 00:05:45.929 position:50% align:center
I've never arm sumo'd or
anything, so go easy.

00:05:46.012 --> 00:05:48.765 position:50% align:center
[AYAKA] Heebs. C'mon.
You know me better than that.

00:05:48.848 --> 00:05:50.934 position:50% align:center
Make sure you get
a firm grip on her.

00:05:51.017 --> 00:05:52.686 position:50% align:center
Positioning is important.

00:05:52.769 --> 00:05:54.437 position:50% align:center
Your thumb's first knuckle
should be between

00:05:54.521 --> 00:05:56.523 position:50% align:center
their index and middle finger.

00:05:56.606 --> 00:05:58.858 position:50% align:center

Hell nah. Why would I wrestle
a bunch of meatheads

00:08:26.006 --> 00:08:27.716 position:50% align:center
when I can't even beat you?

00:08:27.799 --> 00:08:29.509 position:50% align:center
Sorry, I'm too busy being old.

00:08:29.592 --> 00:08:30.844 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
You guys're traitors!

00:08:30.927 --> 00:08:32.846 position:50% align:center
And what's Akemi's problem?

00:08:32.929 --> 00:08:35.015 position:50% align:center
She picked the worst possible
time to get sick!

00:08:35.098 --> 00:08:36.433 position:50% align:center
[coughs]

00:08:36.516 --> 00:08:38.893 position:50% align:center
This sucks.
I'd rather be wrestling.

00:08:38.977 --> 00:08:41.021 position:50% align:center
[MACHIO]
We might have a tiny problem.

00:08:41.104 --> 00:08:42.397 position:50% align:center
There aren't as many
people signed up

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:44.566 position:50% align:center
for the women's division
as I'd expected.

00:08:44.649 --> 00:08:46.276 position:50% align:center
We're supposed to sort
you all by rank,

00:08:46.359 --> 00:08:48.987 position:50% align:center
but there's probably only one
per group at the most.

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:50.572 position:50% align:center
Are there really that
few of us here?

00:08:50.655 --> 00:08:54.034 position:50% align:center
Including you, we have exactly
two females signed up.

00:08:54.117 --> 00:08:55.618 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI] So the first round
will be the final?!

00:08:55.702 --> 00:08:58.121 position:50% align:center
I originally planned for
a three-person round-robin,

00:08:58.204 --> 00:09:00.582 position:50% align:center
but then Akemi got sick, so the
whole thing kinda fell apart.

00:09:00.665 --> 00:09:02.417 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI] You only had three
people sign up?

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:04.252 position:50% align:center
You should fire your
entire marketing team!

00:09:04.336 --> 00:09:06.379 position:50% align:center
[TACHIBANA] Are you seriously
complaining about this?

00:09:06.463 --> 00:09:07.839 position:50% align:center
Don't freak out just yet.

00:09:07.922 --> 00:09:09.382 position:50% align:center
Your goal is to win
this thing, right?

00:09:09.466 --> 00:09:11.843 position:50% align:center
So if there's only one person to
defeat, you're almost there!

00:09:11.926 --> 00:09:13.636 position:50% align:center
Oh! Yeah, that's true!

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:16.139 position:50% align:center
And I'm that much closer to
building a home of dreams!

00:09:16.222 --> 00:09:18.725 position:50% align:center
They'd pretty much have to be
a mutant to beat you anyway,

00:09:18.808 --> 00:09:20.226 position:50% align:center
so it doesn't matter
who shows up.

00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:21.186 position:50% align:center
Good luck, Hibiki!

00:09:21.269 --> 00:09:22.437 position:50% align:center
This is gonna be good.

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:24.022 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
Thanks! Lemme at 'em!

00:09:24.105 --> 00:09:27.067 position:50% align:center
[ATTENDEES chattering]

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:29.235 position:50% align:center
Okay! We're sorry for the delay.

00:09:29.319 --> 00:09:32.280 position:50% align:center
Make some noise if you're ready
for the women's division match.

00:09:32.364 --> 00:09:34.074 position:50% align:center
[ATTENDEES cheer]

00:09:34.157 --> 00:09:35.825 position:50% align:center
They're really hardcore
about this.

00:09:35.909 --> 00:09:36.659 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:09:36.743 --> 00:09:37.952 position:50% align:center
Crazy.

00:09:38.036 --> 00:09:39.287 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS]
Uh?

00:09:47.379 --> 00:09:50.256 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI] She's got murder in her
eyes and the "I'm serious" bob!

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:52.467 position:50% align:center
[MACHIO]
That is Gina Boyd.

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:53.843 position:50% align:center
She's Russian.

00:09:53.927 --> 00:09:55.929 position:50% align:center
From Kremlin West High School.

00:09:56.012 --> 00:09:58.473 position:50% align:center
She took fifth place
in a tournament in Mosco.

00:09:58.556 --> 00:10:01.059 position:50% align:center
She's what we would call
an orthodox arm wrestler.

00:10:01.142 --> 00:10:02.227 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
Cool, cool, cool, cool.

00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:03.645 position:50% align:center
What does that mean?

00:10:03.728 --> 00:10:05.063 position:50% align:center
[TACHIBANA] Sounds like
she's got a lot of experience

00:10:05.146 --> 00:10:06.439 position:50% align:center
in this sport, huh?

00:10:06.523 --> 00:10:08.316 position:50% align:center
[AYAKA]
She's gonna plow you.

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:09.651 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:10:09.734 --> 00:10:10.485 position:50% align:center
Heh.

00:10:10.568 --> 00:10:11.778 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI growls]

00:10:11.861 --> 00:10:14.114 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI] I don't care how
experienced she is!

00:10:14.197 --> 00:10:16.449 position:50% align:center
She's going down! Hard!

00:10:16.533 --> 00:10:19.327 position:50% align:center
Nothing's gonna keep me
from gettin' that bread!

00:10:19.411 --> 00:10:22.122 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] Who says money
can't buy motivation?

00:10:22.205 --> 00:10:24.207 position:50% align:center
Not this girl. Mm-mm!

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:25.625 position:50% align:center
[ATTENDEES chattering, cheering]

00:10:25.709 --> 00:10:27.043 position:50% align:center
[RECEPTIONIST 1A]
From the Silverman Gym,

00:10:27.127 --> 00:10:30.672 position:50% align:center
Kibikukuri-cho branch,
Hibiki Sakura!

00:10:30.755 --> 00:10:35.385 position:50% align:center
And from the Silverman Gym,
Moscow branch, Gina Boyd!

00:10:35.468 --> 00:10:36.886 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
I remember Mr. Machio saying

00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:39.431 position:50% align:center
Russia is a superpower in
the arm-wrestling world.

00:10:39.514 --> 00:10:40.724 position:50% align:center
This won't be easy.

00:10:40.807 --> 00:10:42.350 position:50% align:center
And hopefully not
too humiliating.

00:10:42.434 --> 00:10:44.310 position:50% align:center
You're not going to win.

00:10:44.394 --> 00:10:47.313 position:50% align:center
I need this money and I'm not
leaving here without it.

00:10:47.397 --> 00:10:50.275 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI] Come on! What could
possibly be that important?

00:10:50.358 --> 00:10:52.152 position:50% align:center
Traveling here from
Russia is not cheap.

00:10:52.235 --> 00:10:54.195 position:50% align:center
I've racked up quite
the bill already.

00:10:54.279 --> 00:10:55.822 position:50% align:center
It's more expensive
here than I thought.

00:10:55.905 --> 00:10:58.408 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI] That's it? Girl, we're
talkin' surround sound here.

00:10:58.491 --> 00:11:00.952 position:50% align:center
Are you ready?
This is the final round!

00:11:01.036 --> 00:11:04.414 position:50% align:center
Women's championship starts now!

00:11:11.421 --> 00:11:13.548 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR 6A]
Gina Boyd is 17 years old

00:11:13.631 --> 00:11:15.842 position:50% align:center
and currently
searching for love.

00:11:15.925 --> 00:11:18.470 position:50% align:center
So what's the secret behind
her winning strength?

00:11:18.553 --> 00:11:20.305 position:50% align:center
We caught up with her
at a local café

00:11:20.388 --> 00:11:22.557 position:50% align:center
and asked her this
very question.

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:24.184 position:50% align:center
I am so glad you asked.

00:11:24.267 --> 00:11:26.978 position:50% align:center
Arm wrestling is basically
made up of two moves.

00:11:27.062 --> 00:11:28.730 position:50% align:center
The hook and the top roll.

00:11:28.813 --> 00:11:30.857 position:50% align:center
Of course, there are several
other moves you can use,

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:32.817 position:50% align:center
but they all have elements
of these two.

00:11:32.901 --> 00:11:35.278 position:50% align:center
I guess I should explain
how each one works.

00:11:35.362 --> 00:11:36.780 position:50% align:center
Let's start with the hook.

00:11:36.863 --> 00:11:38.406 position:50% align:center
Hook your arm around
your opponent's

00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:41.326 position:50% align:center
and then lean into your
grip from above.

00:11:41.409 --> 00:11:43.453 position:50% align:center
This technique is used
by those who like to win

00:11:43.536 --> 00:11:46.581 position:50% align:center
with brute force and
minimum strategy.

00:11:46.664 --> 00:11:51.086 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Well this took a turn,
didn't it? All right.

00:11:51.169 --> 00:11:53.963 position:50% align:center
I love how beautiful
it is all year-round.

00:11:54.047 --> 00:11:55.965 position:50% align:center
Was that a trick question?

00:11:56.049 --> 00:12:00.095 position:50% align:center
Almost forgot what I was saying.
Second move is the top roll.

00:12:00.178 --> 00:12:02.138 position:50% align:center
You use your whole body
to pull, then bend

00:12:02.222 --> 00:12:05.308 position:50% align:center
their wrist down by yanking the
thumb away from their hand.

00:12:05.392 --> 00:12:07.644 position:50% align:center
Imagine their arm is
supported by a triangle.

00:12:07.727 --> 00:12:10.146 position:50% align:center
It's formed with their shoulder,
elbow, and forearm.

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:12.482 position:50% align:center
If you break that triangle,
it throws them off balance

00:12:12.565 --> 00:12:15.485 position:50% align:center
and makes it difficult
for them to fight back.

00:12:15.568 --> 00:12:17.570 position:50% align:center
You basically force them
into a weak position

00:12:17.654 --> 00:12:20.281 position:50% align:center
so you can crush them and
you gotta be quick about it.

00:12:20.365 --> 00:12:23.201 position:50% align:center
The top roll is also
my signature move.

00:12:23.284 --> 00:12:24.994 position:50% align:center
The most common
mistake is assuming

00:12:25.078 --> 00:12:26.663 position:50% align:center
that one can win an
arm-wrestling match

00:12:26.746 --> 00:12:28.415 position:50% align:center
with arms alone.

00:12:28.498 --> 00:12:29.624 position:50% align:center
Sorry, what?

00:12:29.708 --> 00:12:31.459 position:50% align:center
You want to know my
favorite Japanese food?

00:12:31.543 --> 00:12:32.752 position:50% align:center
Uh, <i>takoyaki</i> ?

00:12:32.836 --> 00:12:35.255 position:50% align:center
Anyway, a successful
arm wrestler has more

00:12:35.338 --> 00:12:36.589 position:50% align:center
than just arm strength.

00:12:36.673 --> 00:12:38.633 position:50% align:center
They're also required to
have excellent technique!

00:12:38.717 --> 00:12:39.968 position:50% align:center
What is up with this interview?!

00:12:40.051 --> 00:12:41.386 position:50% align:center
Is she trying to put
us all to sleep?

00:12:41.469 --> 00:12:43.430 position:50% align:center
You don't have to
Russia-splain everything!

00:12:43.513 --> 00:12:46.182 position:50% align:center
[GINA] You can apply these
techniques to arm sumo as well,

00:12:46.266 --> 00:12:47.726 position:50% align:center
try them next time
you're training,

00:12:47.809 --> 00:12:50.478 position:50% align:center
but always remember to
use safety precautions.

00:12:50.562 --> 00:12:52.522 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR 6A] And so, she
continues on her journey

00:12:52.605 --> 00:12:55.775 position:50% align:center
to find a worthy opponent.
Good luck, Gina.

00:12:55.859 --> 00:12:58.361 position:50% align:center
[GINA chuckles]

00:12:58.445 --> 00:13:00.905 position:50% align:center
[GINA]
She seems to be around my age.

00:13:00.989 --> 00:13:04.034 position:50% align:center
If so, she won't be nearly
as experienced as I am.

00:13:04.117 --> 00:13:07.078 position:50% align:center
They should just hand me the
money and save some time.

00:13:07.162 --> 00:13:09.247 position:50% align:center
You look like you're
ready to begin?

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:11.082 position:50% align:center
[GINA] Why is the
referee standing here

00:13:11.166 --> 00:13:15.462 position:50% align:center
in his under-thong?
Must be a weird Japanese thing.

00:13:15.545 --> 00:13:17.088 position:50% align:center

All right, ladies.

00:13:17.172 --> 00:13:19.341 position:50% align:center

you buy some new clothes

00:14:01.049 --> 00:14:02.050 position:50% align:center
with that prize money first.

00:14:02.133 --> 00:14:03.259 position:50% align:center

00:14:10.892 --> 00:14:13.269 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] Hibiki was
becoming more like Machio

00:14:13.353 --> 00:14:16.064 position:50% align:center
than she ever knew was possible.

[HIBIKI groans]
I'm finally not sore!

00:14:20.902 --> 00:14:22.320 position:50% align:center
Is the world about to end?

00:14:22.404 --> 00:14:24.447 position:50% align:center
I'm still processing that
you're a wrestling champ.

00:14:24.531 --> 00:14:26.449 position:50% align:center
She frikkin
steamrolled that moose!

00:14:26.533 --> 00:14:29.828 position:50% align:center
It wasn't that easy, and I think
she may be holding a grudge.

00:14:29.911 --> 00:14:31.955 position:50% align:center
Before she left, she said...

00:14:32.038 --> 00:14:34.708 position:50% align:center
I'm sure we'll battle again
sooner than you think.

00:14:34.791 --> 00:14:37.502 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI] Which sounds like the
bad guys in sports manga.

00:14:37.585 --> 00:14:40.088 position:50% align:center
[AYAKA] So you're like official
rivals now. Weird.

00:14:40.171 --> 00:14:42.215 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI] I really wish
I could've met her.

00:14:42.298 --> 00:14:44.300 position:50% align:center
You could always take a
trip to Russia, I guess.

00:14:44.384 --> 00:14:46.845 position:50% align:center
But I wouldn't if I were you.
They think vodka is water.

00:14:46.928 --> 00:14:48.805 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS]
Uh?

00:14:48.888 --> 00:14:51.433 position:50% align:center
Privetik! Good to see you again!

00:14:51.516 --> 00:14:53.268 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS gasping]

00:14:53.351 --> 00:14:56.813 position:50% align:center
By the way, I decided I should
study abroad at your school.

00:14:56.896 --> 00:14:58.606 position:50% align:center
I won't lose a second time.

00:14:58.690 --> 00:15:00.775 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI] Wait, wait, wait, wait.
You moved here to get me back?

00:15:00.859 --> 00:15:02.318 position:50% align:center
Couldn't you just prank call me?

00:15:02.402 --> 00:15:04.404 position:50% align:center
It must be so fun
to have a rival!

00:15:04.487 --> 00:15:08.158 position:50% align:center
Not sure this counts as a rival.
I'm getting mad stalker vibes.

00:15:08.241 --> 00:15:09.743 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
Whether they liked it or not,

00:15:09.826 --> 00:15:13.913 position:50% align:center
Gina Boyd became the new member
of the strength-training crew.

00:15:13.997 --> 00:15:15.540 position:50% align:center
[KURE]
Good morning, everyone.

00:15:15.623 --> 00:15:16.791 position:50% align:center
May I have your attention?

00:15:16.875 --> 00:15:19.085 position:50% align:center
We have a new transfer
student in class today.

00:15:19.169 --> 00:15:22.213 position:50% align:center
Introduce yourself to your
new classmates, my dear.

00:15:22.297 --> 00:15:24.799 position:50% align:center
Hello and greetings,
Japanese student friends.

00:15:24.883 --> 00:15:26.551 position:50% align:center
I just transferred
here from Russia.

00:15:26.634 --> 00:15:28.386 position:50% align:center
My name's Gina Boyd.

00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:29.929 position:50% align:center
I'll be honest with you.

00:15:30.013 --> 00:15:31.556 position:50% align:center
I'm here for Hibiki Sakura!

00:15:31.639 --> 00:15:33.641 position:50% align:center
I challenge you, to an
arm-wrestling rematch!

00:15:33.725 --> 00:15:36.519 position:50% align:center
Right here, right now!

00:15:36.603 --> 00:15:39.814 position:50% align:center
Oh my. You're a lively one,
aren't you?

00:15:39.898 --> 00:15:42.776 position:50% align:center
Excuse me.
Hibiki's in Class B.

00:15:42.859 --> 00:15:44.778 position:50% align:center
She's actually next door.

00:15:46.446 --> 00:15:49.115 position:50% align:center
Aw, Bliat! How dare you?!

00:15:49.199 --> 00:15:51.284 position:50% align:center
What were you doing
in the other class?

00:15:51.368 --> 00:15:53.411 position:50% align:center
You're plotting against me,
aren't you, Hibiki!

00:15:53.495 --> 00:15:55.330 position:50% align:center
Look who's talking
"plotting," Russia.

00:15:55.413 --> 00:15:56.915 position:50% align:center
What the hell?

00:15:56.998 --> 00:15:59.376 position:50% align:center
It's like you flipped a switch
and became a different person!

00:15:59.459 --> 00:16:03.171 position:50% align:center
Of course I did! I can
create any persona I want!

00:16:03.254 --> 00:16:05.548 position:50% align:center
Haven't you noticed that Russian
characters in the media

00:16:05.632 --> 00:16:07.676 position:50% align:center
often fall into three
different categories?

00:16:07.759 --> 00:16:10.136 position:50% align:center
[GINA laughs]

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:11.888 position:50% align:center
[GINA grunts]

00:16:11.971 --> 00:16:15.058 position:50% align:center
Harasho! Russia!

00:16:15.141 --> 00:16:16.601 position:50% align:center
I've been working very
hard to maintain

00:16:16.685 --> 00:16:18.645 position:50% align:center
our beloved national
stereotypes.

00:16:18.728 --> 00:16:20.230 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
That girl's broken inside.

00:16:20.313 --> 00:16:21.690 position:50% align:center
[GINA] Just as the motto
of our country--

00:16:21.773 --> 00:16:23.817 position:50% align:center
coined by the great
Comrade Poutine--says,

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:25.652 position:50% align:center
"always do your best,
no matter what."

00:16:25.735 --> 00:16:27.195 position:50% align:center
That's not an original saying!

00:16:27.278 --> 00:16:29.698 position:50% align:center
And why disrespect bears
with this screen shot?

00:16:29.781 --> 00:16:31.866 position:50% align:center
Um Gina. Did you
used to work out

00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:34.411 position:50% align:center
at the Silverman Gym in Moscow
when you lived in Russia?

00:16:34.494 --> 00:16:35.912 position:50% align:center
Da.

00:16:35.995 --> 00:16:37.580 position:50% align:center
What was your training routine
typically like out there?

00:16:37.664 --> 00:16:39.666 position:50% align:center
Are you asking about
weight training?

00:16:39.749 --> 00:16:41.418 position:50% align:center
We never did any of that stuff.

00:16:41.501 --> 00:16:42.335 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:42.419 --> 00:16:44.129 position:50% align:center
I promise you'll be all right.

00:16:44.212 --> 00:16:45.964 position:50% align:center
How could you? And why not?

00:16:46.047 --> 00:16:48.091 position:50% align:center
How and why would you not
do any weight training

00:16:48.174 --> 00:16:49.259 position:50% align:center
at Silverman Gym?

00:16:49.342 --> 00:16:51.428 position:50% align:center
That's a waste of a
fantastic facility!

00:16:51.511 --> 00:16:54.055 position:50% align:center
[GINA]
What is wrong with her?

00:16:54.139 --> 00:16:55.640 position:50% align:center
[GINA] I'll tell you
what I did at the gym,

00:16:55.724 --> 00:16:58.268 position:50% align:center
but you have to stop
shaking me, now!

00:16:58.351 --> 00:17:02.022 position:50% align:center
They offered a lot of classes
there, and I would take Sambo.

00:17:02.105 --> 00:17:04.983 position:50% align:center
[AYAKA] Sambo! So you're
into martial arts, too?

00:17:05.066 --> 00:17:07.152 position:50% align:center
I immediately feel
so much closer to you.

00:17:07.235 --> 00:17:08.862 position:50% align:center
Then what's with
the arm wrestling?

00:17:08.945 --> 00:17:10.321 position:50% align:center
[GINA]
Are you judging me?

00:17:10.405 --> 00:17:13.450 position:50% align:center
My Sambo buddies and I just
started doing it for fun.

00:17:13.533 --> 00:17:15.118 position:50% align:center
And until I met you,

00:17:15.201 --> 00:17:18.621 position:50% align:center
I'd never lost a battle to
anyone close to my age.

00:17:18.705 --> 00:17:20.874 position:50% align:center
So what do you think we should
do about that, Hibiki?

00:17:20.957 --> 00:17:22.917 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI] I would say let
it go and move on?

00:17:23.001 --> 00:17:25.253 position:50% align:center
[AYAKA] She's really committing
to this whole revenge thing.

00:17:25.337 --> 00:17:26.713 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI]
I'm so confused.

00:17:26.796 --> 00:17:29.049 position:50% align:center
How can you study martial
arts but then not do any

00:17:29.132 --> 00:17:32.385 position:50% align:center
strength training?
All you do is cardio?

00:17:32.469 --> 00:17:34.429 position:50% align:center
Well no, but what the big deal?

00:17:34.512 --> 00:17:36.514 position:50% align:center
I mean. You can still
train for strength

00:17:36.598 --> 00:17:38.725 position:50% align:center
without using a
bunch of equipment.

00:17:38.808 --> 00:17:41.394 position:50% align:center
The Moscow branch didn't
have much available.

00:17:41.478 --> 00:17:43.021 position:50% align:center
We mainly did
bodyweight training

00:17:43.104 --> 00:17:45.357 position:50% align:center
with pushups, pull-ups,
squats, and deeps.

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:46.858 position:50% align:center
Because of our
lack of equipment,

00:17:46.941 --> 00:17:48.526 position:50% align:center
we used the kipping method.

00:17:48.610 --> 00:17:50.028 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS]
What's that?

00:17:50.111 --> 00:17:52.197 position:50% align:center
It's a method that utilizes
the strength of your muscles

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:54.282 position:50% align:center
to train them evenly.
We use momentum

00:17:54.366 --> 00:17:56.951 position:50% align:center
to increase the reps we
complete with each exercise.

00:17:57.035 --> 00:17:58.411 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:58.495 --> 00:18:00.163 position:50% align:center
That's actually a lot like
the way we train for boxing.

00:18:00.246 --> 00:18:01.790 position:50% align:center
It sounds cool,
can you teach us?

00:18:01.873 --> 00:18:04.417 position:50% align:center
Sure. I think we have enough
time before class starts.

00:18:04.501 --> 00:18:10.048 position:50% align:center
This high bar is a
perfect place for it.

00:18:10.131 --> 00:18:11.549 position:50% align:center
[GINA]
Ah!

00:18:13.176 --> 00:18:15.136 position:50% align:center
<i>Zdravstvuyte</i> ! Hello!

00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:17.472 position:50% align:center
I'm Gina Boyd, and today
I'm going to help you

00:18:17.555 --> 00:18:19.182 position:50% align:center
understand the kipping method!

00:18:19.265 --> 00:18:21.184 position:50% align:center
To my right is a chinning stand.

00:18:21.267 --> 00:18:23.186 position:50% align:center
We use it for chin-ups
and pull ups!

00:18:23.269 --> 00:18:24.646 position:50% align:center
Depending on the exercise,

00:18:24.729 --> 00:18:27.524 position:50% align:center
use either an overhand or
underhand grip on the bar.

00:18:27.607 --> 00:18:28.983 position:50% align:center
As long as you have
enough space,

00:18:29.067 --> 00:18:31.194 position:50% align:center
this is great for chin-ups
and pullups.

00:18:31.277 --> 00:18:32.862 position:50% align:center
Slowly pull your body to the top

00:18:32.946 --> 00:18:34.906 position:50% align:center
and then lower
yourself back down.

00:18:34.989 --> 00:18:37.617 position:50% align:center
Now you just did
your first chin-up.

00:18:37.701 --> 00:18:40.286 position:50% align:center
So what's the difference
between doing these exercises

00:18:40.370 --> 00:18:42.455 position:50% align:center
with and without momentum?

00:18:42.539 --> 00:18:45.125 position:50% align:center
The keyword here
is coordination!

00:18:45.208 --> 00:18:47.544 position:50% align:center
Martial artists can struggle
to build their strength

00:18:47.627 --> 00:18:50.130 position:50% align:center
with the isolated movements
of weight training.

00:18:50.213 --> 00:18:52.257 position:50% align:center
Their strength is instead
improved by practicing

00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:53.758 position:50% align:center
their techniques regularly.

00:18:53.842 --> 00:18:56.553 position:50% align:center
This also builds muscle memory
to create fluid movements.

00:18:56.636 --> 00:18:59.264 position:50% align:center
Kipping exercises are unique in
that they require momentum

00:18:59.347 --> 00:19:01.891 position:50% align:center
to work properly.
Use momentum to raise and lower

00:19:01.975 --> 00:19:04.519 position:50% align:center
your body quickly without ever
fully extending your arms.

00:19:04.602 --> 00:19:07.188 position:50% align:center
Keep the rhythm for
sets of 30 to 50.

00:19:07.272 --> 00:19:09.315 position:50% align:center
It's important to note
that this kind of training

00:19:09.399 --> 00:19:11.651 position:50% align:center
will develop your nerves
and endurance much faster

00:19:11.735 --> 00:19:12.819 position:50% align:center
than your muscle strength.

00:19:12.902 --> 00:19:14.821 position:50% align:center
But learning to coordinate
your entire body

00:19:14.904 --> 00:19:16.531 position:50% align:center
and develop controlled,
fluid movements

00:19:16.614 --> 00:19:18.908 position:50% align:center
will help you train more
efficiently overall.

00:19:18.992 --> 00:19:20.660 position:50% align:center
Traditional strength training.

00:19:20.744 --> 00:19:22.537 position:50% align:center
And exercising with momentum.

00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:24.289 position:50% align:center
They each have their benefits.

00:19:24.372 --> 00:19:26.833 position:50% align:center
Use both for maximum efficiency.

00:19:28.835 --> 00:19:30.545 position:50% align:center
That sounds stupid intense.

00:19:30.628 --> 00:19:34.007 position:50% align:center
Crazy momentum aside, sets
of thirty to 50 is intimidating.

00:19:34.090 --> 00:19:36.760 position:50% align:center
It's really not
that bad, Hibiki!

00:19:36.843 --> 00:19:39.763 position:50% align:center
Like our great leader
Comrade Poutine always says,

00:19:39.846 --> 00:19:42.015 position:50% align:center
"all you have to do
is your very best."

00:19:42.098 --> 00:19:44.059 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI] Can you please stop
talking about that dude?

00:19:44.142 --> 00:19:45.560 position:50% align:center
Why didn't I change
into my gym clothes

00:19:45.643 --> 00:19:47.395 position:50% align:center
if we were gonna do this?

00:19:47.479 --> 00:19:48.646 position:50% align:center
[GINA laughs]

00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:50.982 position:50% align:center
[GINA] Show me what you've got,
Miss Champion.

00:19:51.066 --> 00:19:54.569 position:50% align:center
What is this strange dark
strength you used to defeat me?

00:19:54.652 --> 00:19:59.491 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI] Ahh! What's wrong
with me? Why can't I do it?

00:19:59.574 --> 00:20:01.076 position:50% align:center
--It's okay, Hibiki!
--What's wrong with me?

00:20:01.159 --> 00:20:03.620 position:50% align:center
I'm not surprised you couldn't
do it, ya little butter ball.

00:20:03.703 --> 00:20:05.038 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI] Who're you
callin' a butter ball?

00:20:05.121 --> 00:20:07.499 position:50% align:center
[GINA] I'm not falling for
that. Though I get why

00:20:07.582 --> 00:20:09.876 position:50% align:center
she wouldn't want to
reveal her hand just yet.

00:20:09.959 --> 00:20:12.379 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] What Gina didn't get
was that she was wrong.

00:20:12.462 --> 00:20:13.922 position:50% align:center
So wrong.

00:20:14.005 --> 00:20:15.965 position:50% align:center
If you can't do full
chin-ups on the bar yet,

00:20:16.049 --> 00:20:18.176 position:50% align:center
you can try incline
chin-ups like this.

00:20:18.259 --> 00:20:19.386 position:50% align:center
That's right.

00:20:19.469 --> 00:20:23.640 position:50% align:center
Find a good tempo to use
with your momentum!

00:20:23.723 --> 00:20:26.184 position:50% align:center
[sighs] Today was
a long one, huh?

00:20:26.267 --> 00:20:28.812 position:50% align:center
We usually go to the gym after
school, you wanna come?

00:20:28.895 --> 00:20:30.563 position:50% align:center
Did you switch your
membership over, yet?

00:20:30.647 --> 00:20:32.607 position:50% align:center
Da, but I don't think
I can train today.

00:20:32.691 --> 00:20:35.735 position:50% align:center
I need to go home and spend some
time with my host family.

00:20:35.819 --> 00:20:38.905 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI] Sounds good! Guess
we'll see you tomorrow, then!

00:20:38.988 --> 00:20:42.200 position:50% align:center
--[AKEMI] Have a good night!
--[AYAKA] See ya later!

00:20:42.283 --> 00:20:45.286 position:50% align:center
<i>Da svidanya,</i> Hibiki.

00:20:47.414 --> 00:20:51.418 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI] I'm home!
Today was so exhausting!

00:20:51.501 --> 00:20:56.172 position:50% align:center
Wha--? Why would we have
a guest this late?

00:20:56.256 --> 00:20:59.384 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] Everything suddenly
became uncomfortably clear.

00:20:59.467 --> 00:21:01.469 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI panting]

00:21:02.512 --> 00:21:04.556 position:50% align:center
Welcome home, host <i>sestra</i> !

00:21:04.639 --> 00:21:06.266 position:50% align:center
I'm glad to be staying with you!

00:21:06.349 --> 00:21:07.851 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI groans]

00:21:07.934 --> 00:21:11.104 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI] I guess we were due
for some sort of twist.

00:21:11.187 --> 00:21:14.983 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] I don't know how
to respond to all that?

00:22:45.407 --> 00:22:48.952 position:50% align:center
Hey there, guys! Today let's
try momentum-based training!

00:22:49.035 --> 00:22:51.287 position:50% align:center
We already worked on
chin-ups earlier today.

00:22:51.371 --> 00:22:53.164 position:50% align:center
Now we're going to work
on some jump-pushups

00:22:53.248 --> 00:22:54.499 position:50% align:center
that you can do anywhere!

00:22:54.582 --> 00:22:57.210 position:50% align:center
It's just a normal pushup
with a jump added in.

00:22:57.293 --> 00:22:58.503 position:50% align:center
=Does this look familiar?

00:22:58.586 --> 00:23:02.590 position:50% align:center
You'll use the same form
as a normal pushup.

00:23:02.674 --> 00:23:04.050 position:50% align:center
If you have an apartment,

00:23:04.134 --> 00:23:06.678 position:50% align:center
then choose an appropriate
time and place to do these.

00:23:06.761 --> 00:23:09.973 position:50% align:center
Watch your shoulders. Your
form is very important here.

00:23:10.056 --> 00:23:12.809 position:50% align:center
Careful! Always keep your elbows
slightly bent when you land.

00:23:12.892 --> 00:23:14.602 position:50% align:center
This will relieve
a lot of pressure.

00:23:14.686 --> 00:23:16.104 position:50% align:center
Don't push yourself too hard.

00:23:16.187 --> 00:23:18.064 position:50% align:center
You can start on your
knees if you need to.

00:23:18.148 --> 00:23:21.818 position:50% align:center
Your goal is ten reps.
Ready? Go!

00:23:21.901 --> 00:23:24.863 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI] If it's too hard, you
can modify on your knees!

00:23:24.946 --> 00:23:28.283 position:50% align:center
[AYAKA] Find a safe tempo,
and keep that rhythm!

00:23:28.366 --> 00:23:30.577 position:50% align:center
[MACHIO]
Five! Six!

00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:33.955 position:50% align:center
Harasho! Don't give up!

00:23:34.039 --> 00:23:36.833 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
This is... the last one!

00:23:36.916 --> 00:23:39.836 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS cheering, laughing]

00:23:39.919 --> 00:23:41.296 position:50% align:center
Be consistent with this.

00:23:41.379 --> 00:23:43.256 position:50% align:center
And I guarantee you'll see
more results than you would

00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:44.758 position:50% align:center
with regular pushups!

00:23:44.841 --> 00:23:46.593 position:50% align:center
And always remember kids...

00:23:46.676 --> 00:23:49.679 position:50% align:center
[ALL] ...true strength
comes from within!
