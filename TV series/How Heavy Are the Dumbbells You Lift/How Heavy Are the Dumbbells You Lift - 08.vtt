If you guessed "abs,"
you're right!

00:04:52.208 --> 00:04:54.711 position:50% align:center
Your abs are divided
into four major sections.

00:04:54.794 --> 00:04:57.255 position:50% align:center
The rectus abdominis
muscle is right in front.

00:04:57.339 --> 00:04:59.758 position:50% align:center

abdominal deep inside.

00:04:59.841 --> 00:05:02.302 position:50% align:center

These are the muscles
you need to target

00:05:05.388 --> 00:05:08.224 position:50% align:center

Bicycle crunches like

If you have hand

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:23.615 position:50% align:center
as the dumbbell, then return
to your original position.

00:05:23.698 --> 00:05:25.575 position:50% align:center
Keep the obliques flexed
throughout the motion.

00:05:25.658 --> 00:05:28.328 position:50% align:center
Aim for 15 to 20 reps
on each side.

00:05:28.411 --> 00:05:30.372 position:50% align:center
Keep your active arm
controlled as you bend--

00:05:30.455 --> 00:05:31.873 position:50% align:center
a swinging arm
creates momentum,

00:05:31.956 --> 00:05:34.042 position:50% align:center
which can throw
off your balance.

will give you a
low-intensity workout.

I am glad to be climbing
the mountains with you.

00:08:09.989 --> 00:08:12.075 position:50% align:center
I've never done hardcore
hiking before.

00:08:13.451 --> 00:08:15.870 position:50% align:center
[AINA] Hey! Can we have
everyone's attention?

00:08:15.954 --> 00:08:17.330 position:50% align:center
Before we get started,

00:08:17.414 --> 00:08:19.833 position:50% align:center
we need to tell you about
some hiking dos and don'ts.

00:08:19.916 --> 00:08:22.085 position:50% align:center
But first, let's learn a
little about the mountain

00:08:22.168 --> 00:08:24.212 position:50% align:center
we're climbing today.

00:08:24.671 --> 00:08:26.715 position:50% align:center
[STUDENTS murmuring]

00:08:28.008 --> 00:08:31.386 position:50% align:center
[KURE]
This is called Mount Kuji.

00:08:31.469 --> 00:08:33.847 position:50% align:center
It overlooks Gakigahara,
or the Ghost Forest,

00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:35.849 position:50% align:center
and is referred to as the
"Mountain of the Dead."

00:08:35.932 --> 00:08:37.726 position:50% align:center
Why would you associate
a mountain people climb

00:08:37.809 --> 00:08:38.560 position:50% align:center
with the dead?!

00:08:38.643 --> 00:08:39.644 position:50% align:center
Don't you worry!

00:08:39.728 --> 00:08:41.312 position:50% align:center
Luckily, we're prepared
and scoped out

00:08:41.396 --> 00:08:42.647 position:50% align:center
a safe route beforehand!

00:08:42.731 --> 00:08:44.190 position:50% align:center
Everything'll be fine.

00:08:44.274 --> 00:08:47.610 position:50% align:center
Maybe. Only if we're careful.
Then we'll probably be fine.

00:08:47.694 --> 00:08:49.821 position:50% align:center
Was that supposed
to be reassuring?

00:08:49.904 --> 00:08:51.031 position:50% align:center
Be real.

00:08:51.114 --> 00:08:52.615 position:50% align:center
Are we gonna die out
here on this mountain?

00:08:52.699 --> 00:08:54.409 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't worry about it.

00:08:54.492 --> 00:08:57.203 position:50% align:center
I wasn't assigned to this trip
so I don't know what they know.

00:08:57.287 --> 00:08:59.414 position:50% align:center
But I'm pretty sure
they're exaggerating.

00:08:59.497 --> 00:09:01.124 position:50% align:center
It keeps you guys in line.

00:09:01.207 --> 00:09:02.167 position:50% align:center

All right, let's head out!

00:09:16.222 --> 00:09:18.933 position:50% align:center

up in someone's freezer.

Stay close behind!

00:09:21.561 --> 00:09:24.439 position:50% align:center

you think we'll be okay?

00:09:24.522 --> 00:09:26.191 position:50% align:center

Man, SMH.

00:09:40.538 --> 00:09:43.166 position:50% align:center
I was so worried about dying and
being consumed by termites,

00:09:43.249 --> 00:09:47.379 position:50% align:center
but this trail is gorge and
the climb isn't even that hard.

What happened to you guys?

00:09:52.092 --> 00:09:54.511 position:50% align:center
Great question. What happened?

00:09:54.594 --> 00:09:56.680 position:50% align:center
How did I get so
grossly out of shape?

00:09:56.763 --> 00:09:59.724 position:50% align:center
My legs... falling off me.

00:10:00.809 --> 00:10:04.562 position:50% align:center
[TACHIBANA] I'm so done
with the aging thing.

00:10:04.646 --> 00:10:07.399 position:50% align:center

Hey. Are you okay?

00:10:11.611 --> 00:10:14.114 position:50% align:center
It's not like you to fall
behind, so I was worried.

00:10:14.197 --> 00:10:16.491 position:50% align:center
I'm not falling behind,
I'm waiting on the elderly.

00:10:16.574 --> 00:10:17.951 position:50% align:center
Oh, that makes sense.

00:10:18.034 --> 00:10:20.537 position:50% align:center
Yeah, they don't look like
they're doing so well.

00:10:22.622 --> 00:10:24.582 position:50% align:center
Yeah! Food!

00:10:24.666 --> 00:10:26.543 position:50% align:center
Come on, Teach-Squad,
it's not that bad!

00:10:26.626 --> 00:10:29.170 position:50% align:center
Look! One of yours
is leading the pack!

00:10:29.254 --> 00:10:31.881 position:50% align:center
Ms. Kure's been leading
all of us since we got here,

00:10:31.965 --> 00:10:35.719 position:50% align:center
and she's way older
than both of you!

00:10:35.802 --> 00:10:37.971 position:50% align:center
If she can do it, then
there's hope for us all!

00:10:38.054 --> 00:10:40.306 position:50% align:center
An icon for 30-somethings!

00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:42.767 position:50% align:center
[KURE] Ms. Tachibana
has nothing to fear.

00:10:42.851 --> 00:10:45.895 position:50% align:center
But Ms. Aina should keep
an eye on her surroundings.

00:10:45.979 --> 00:10:47.397 position:50% align:center
Ms. Kure's not a newb.

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:49.232 position:50% align:center
Seems like she's always
been pretty fit.

00:10:49.315 --> 00:10:52.569 position:50% align:center
And she sure got hot Machio's
seal of approval, didn't she?

00:10:52.652 --> 00:10:54.821 position:50% align:center
I agree that having more
stamina could make this climb

00:10:54.904 --> 00:10:58.074 position:50% align:center
a lot easier, but it's
not just about that.

00:10:58.158 --> 00:11:00.368 position:50% align:center
I mean, for one thing, you both
could make some changes

00:11:00.452 --> 00:11:01.911 position:50% align:center
in the way you're walking.

00:11:01.995 --> 00:11:03.913 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
How are we walking?

[koto plays]

00:11:09.669 --> 00:11:12.630 position:50% align:center
Hi, I'm Yakusha Kure,
homeroom teacher for class 2-A.

00:11:12.714 --> 00:11:15.633 position:50% align:center
Please come on in.
Get comfortable.

00:11:15.717 --> 00:11:17.510 position:50% align:center
Today I'm going to explain
the proper way

00:11:17.594 --> 00:11:19.721 position:50% align:center
to walk when mountain hiking.

00:11:19.804 --> 00:11:21.222 position:50% align:center
When you're looking
for a change of pace,

00:11:21.306 --> 00:11:24.142 position:50% align:center
exercising outdoors
is a great option.

00:11:24.225 --> 00:11:26.311 position:50% align:center
You won't just be physically
training your body,

00:11:26.394 --> 00:11:29.898 position:50% align:center
you'll be doing wonderful
things for your mind as well.

00:11:29.981 --> 00:11:31.191 position:50% align:center
But be careful.

00:11:31.274 --> 00:11:32.942 position:50% align:center
Mountain trails aren't
as predictable

00:11:33.026 --> 00:11:34.903 position:50% align:center
as well-maintained urban roads.

00:11:34.986 --> 00:11:37.155 position:50% align:center
If you walk the same way
on a trail as you would

00:11:37.238 --> 00:11:41.117 position:50% align:center
on a sidewalk, you'll waste your
energy and wear yourself out.

00:11:41.201 --> 00:11:42.577 position:50% align:center
When hiking, you should...

00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:45.622 position:50% align:center
One: walk straight and tall.

00:11:45.705 --> 00:11:48.333 position:50% align:center
Two: always keep
your knees bent.

00:11:48.416 --> 00:11:51.336 position:50% align:center
Three: be sure to step
with your whole foot.

00:11:51.419 --> 00:11:53.588 position:50% align:center
Four: take shorter steps.

00:11:53.672 --> 00:11:56.174 position:50% align:center
And five: maintain
a steady pace.

00:11:56.257 --> 00:11:59.010 position:50% align:center
These tips are important
to keep in mind.

00:11:59.094 --> 00:12:01.471 position:50% align:center
You can also get a similar
workout at home.

00:12:01.554 --> 00:12:04.391 position:50% align:center
Use a platform to do
intervals of step-ups.

00:12:04.474 --> 00:12:08.269 position:50% align:center
If you don't have one, you can
use a stack of large books.

00:12:08.353 --> 00:12:10.772 position:50% align:center
Face forward and step up
and down off the platform in

00:12:10.855 --> 00:12:13.608 position:50% align:center
the same way you would if you
were on a flight of stairs.

00:12:13.692 --> 00:12:16.736 position:50% align:center
Do these for 20
minutes to start.

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:19.823 position:50% align:center
Watching TV, movies, or
listening to music can make

00:12:19.906 --> 00:12:22.158 position:50% align:center
longer sessions a
lot more bearable.

00:12:22.242 --> 00:12:26.162 position:50% align:center
Just don't forget what you're
doing and lose your balance.

00:12:26.246 --> 00:12:29.124 position:50% align:center
Step-ups are great for training
your lower body in a safe

00:12:29.207 --> 00:12:31.793 position:50% align:center
and well-balanced way.

00:12:31.876 --> 00:12:34.546 position:50% align:center
This exercise helps train
for proper hiking form.

00:12:34.629 --> 00:12:38.049 position:50% align:center
It will also help increase the
strength in your leg muscles.

00:12:38.133 --> 00:12:40.844 position:50% align:center
Remember that while hiking
is fun and exciting,

00:12:40.927 --> 00:12:44.305 position:50% align:center
your safety should
always be your priority!

00:12:44.389 --> 00:12:46.266 position:50% align:center
Whoa! Ms. Kure was right!

00:12:46.349 --> 00:12:47.934 position:50% align:center
This is already so much easier!

about how powerless we are.

00:15:12.954 --> 00:15:14.581 position:50% align:center

00:15:14.664 --> 00:15:16.416 position:50% align:center

All right, Ms. Sakura,
are you ready for this?

00:15:20.503 --> 00:15:22.088 position:50% align:center
I was born ready.

00:15:22.172 --> 00:15:23.631 position:50% align:center
[BOTH grunt]

00:15:23.715 --> 00:15:24.799 position:50% align:center

00:15:50.116 --> 00:15:52.577 position:50% align:center
I'm sure there are plenty of
things we can do about this!

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:54.162 position:50% align:center

That's right!

Huh?

00:15:57.791 --> 00:15:59.584 position:50% align:center
I need to make sure they
can identify my body

00:15:59.668 --> 00:16:00.752 position:50% align:center
when they find me.

00:16:00.835 --> 00:16:02.796 position:50% align:center
Ha. I was gonna make
it like a crossword

00:16:02.879 --> 00:16:03.672 position:50% align:center

Goodbye, license!

00:16:05.757 --> 00:16:07.676 position:50% align:center

00:16:25.777 --> 00:16:26.736 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI] Guess we should
finish our wills.

00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:29.322 position:50% align:center
[gasps] That's it!

00:16:29.406 --> 00:16:31.282 position:50% align:center
We need to climb a tree!

00:16:32.784 --> 00:16:35.203 position:50% align:center
Hello there! Today I'm
gonna teach you all about

00:16:35.286 --> 00:16:37.914 position:50% align:center
tree-climbing as an alternative
to your regular gym workout!

00:16:37.997 --> 00:16:39.624 position:50% align:center
So, let's go.

00:16:39.708 --> 00:16:42.836 position:50% align:center
Tree-climbing is a unique
form of strength training.

00:16:42.919 --> 00:16:45.839 position:50% align:center
It utilizes every muscle
in the body efficiently,

00:16:45.922 --> 00:16:47.966 position:50% align:center
and trains you to carry
your own body weight

00:16:48.049 --> 00:16:50.677 position:50% align:center
and move naturally in a
way gym equipment can't.

00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:51.886 position:50% align:center
If you live in the city,

00:16:51.970 --> 00:16:53.638 position:50% align:center
it's probably hard to
find a tree to climb

00:16:53.722 --> 00:16:55.348 position:50% align:center
whenever you feel the need.

00:16:55.432 --> 00:16:57.559 position:50% align:center
So I'll show you a way to
get those tree-like benefits

00:16:57.642 --> 00:16:58.935 position:50% align:center
without an actual tree.

00:16:59.019 --> 00:17:01.646 position:50% align:center
Here's some information
on rope climbing.

00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:04.107 position:50% align:center
It's easy when you
get the hang of it.

00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:06.693 position:50% align:center
Grab the rope and
pull your body up.

00:17:06.776 --> 00:17:09.320 position:50% align:center
And that's it. Rinse and repeat.

00:17:09.404 --> 00:17:11.197 position:50% align:center
When you're pulling
up on the rope,

00:17:11.281 --> 00:17:15.577 position:50% align:center
you're training the biceps
brachii and teres major.

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:18.121 position:50% align:center
Once you've mastered
that, try climbing again

00:17:18.204 --> 00:17:21.207 position:50% align:center
without using your lower body
for a more intense challenge.

00:17:21.291 --> 00:17:23.460 position:50% align:center
Be very careful
and try not to fall.

00:17:23.543 --> 00:17:25.420 position:50% align:center
You can find rope climbing
equipment at your gym

00:17:25.503 --> 00:17:27.922 position:50% align:center
or health spa. Just ask your
trainer or any management

00:17:28.006 --> 00:17:30.008 position:50% align:center
available if you're interested
in trying it out.

00:17:30.091 --> 00:17:32.052 position:50% align:center
You can also use a rope
climbing machine available

00:17:32.135 --> 00:17:34.554 position:50% align:center
at most gyms called
the viper rope climber.

00:17:34.637 --> 00:17:36.014 position:50% align:center
Sometimes it's easier to learn

00:17:36.097 --> 00:17:38.266 position:50% align:center
when you're not afraid
of slipping and falling.

00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:41.394 position:50% align:center
There it is. One rope
and infinite possibilities!

00:17:41.478 --> 00:17:42.604 position:50% align:center
Climb on up to muscle heaven

00:17:42.687 --> 00:17:45.607 position:50% align:center
and reach your swole
goals the jungle way!

00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:48.735 position:50% align:center
I'm glad you know that you can't
go tree-climbing in the city.

00:17:48.818 --> 00:17:50.362 position:50% align:center
But it's also banned in parks.

00:17:50.445 --> 00:17:52.238 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI] Kinda weird you're
talking about training,

00:17:52.322 --> 00:17:53.907 position:50% align:center
when really, we just
need to not die.

00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:55.867 position:50% align:center
I'm not trying to
climb it to train!

00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:58.328 position:50% align:center
This tree's tall. Probably
the tallest one out here.

00:17:58.411 --> 00:17:59.996 position:50% align:center
Which means, if we climb it,

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:01.623 position:50% align:center
we could figure out
exactly where we are

00:18:01.706 --> 00:18:03.249 position:50% align:center
and in which direction
we need to go.

00:18:03.333 --> 00:18:04.918 position:50% align:center
--Oh.
--Great call!

00:18:05.001 --> 00:18:07.545 position:50% align:center
It'll also make it easier for
a search party to find us

00:18:07.629 --> 00:18:09.631 position:50% align:center
if we climb to where
they can see us.

00:18:09.714 --> 00:18:11.049 position:50% align:center
[AINA] That's better
than the "just wait till

00:18:11.132 --> 00:18:12.967 position:50% align:center
someone finds you" strategy.

00:18:15.679 --> 00:18:17.430 position:50% align:center
And we don't have
any other options.

00:18:17.514 --> 00:18:19.307 position:50% align:center
So! Let's get climbing!

have to be so hard?

00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:34.072 position:50% align:center
It's weird. This was
easy when I was a kid!

00:18:45.041 --> 00:18:47.377 position:50% align:center

If you live in an apartment,

00:22:25.303 --> 00:22:27.514 position:50% align:center
don't do these at home
if you live upstairs.

00:22:27.597 --> 00:22:29.557 position:50% align:center
They can be super loud!

[MACHIO] Besides working your
quads, glutes, and hamstrings,

00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:35.355 position:50% align:center
lunges are also good
for strengthening

00:22:35.438 --> 00:22:37.691 position:50% align:center
your hips and calves.

00:22:37.774 --> 00:22:39.943 position:50% align:center

[AYAKA]
This is such a simple exercise,

00:22:46.157 --> 00:22:48.535 position:50% align:center
but it's much harder
than it looks!

00:22:48.618 --> 00:22:51.663 position:50% align:center
[GINA] You can work one leg at a
time or alternate between both.

00:22:51.746 --> 00:22:53.790 position:50% align:center

00:23:04.259 --> 00:23:07.554 position:50% align:center

00:23:15.937 --> 00:23:18.940 position:50% align:center
...and six!

00:23:19.024 --> 00:23:21.985 position:50% align:center
Seven...

00:23:22.068 --> 00:23:24.654 position:50% align:center
Now eight...

00:23:24.738 --> 00:23:27.866 position:50% align:center
[GINA] This movement is also a
great way to stretch your hips!

00:23:27.949 --> 00:23:30.535 position:50% align:center

00:23:30.618 --> 00:23:32.912 position:50% align:center

One more thing!

It's important to have
a balanced workout--

00:23:42.297 --> 00:23:45.216 position:50% align:center
so finish out your lunges on
the left side after we're done.

00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:46.843 position:50% align:center
And you know what comes next...
