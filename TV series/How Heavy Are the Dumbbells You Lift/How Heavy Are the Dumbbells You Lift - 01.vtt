[HIBIKI]
So good!

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.525 position:50% align:center
I'm living for this
after-school snack sesh!

00:00:25.608 --> 00:00:27.694 position:50% align:center
Get in my tummy!

00:00:33.408 --> 00:00:34.868 position:50% align:center
Trying a new look, Hibiki?

00:00:34.951 --> 00:00:36.453 position:50% align:center
Some people like thick girls.

00:00:36.536 --> 00:00:38.038 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
Uh!

00:00:38.121 --> 00:00:40.707 position:50% align:center
What? Are you calling me fat?

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:42.459 position:50% align:center
[AYAKA]
No, I didn't say that.

00:00:42.542 --> 00:00:44.377 position:50% align:center
Just that you look different.

00:00:44.461 --> 00:00:45.962 position:50% align:center
Different's good, right?

00:00:46.046 --> 00:00:49.007 position:50% align:center
I mean, yeah, you're a little
curvier than you were last year!

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:50.008 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI gasps]

00:00:50.091 --> 00:00:52.010 position:50% align:center
So? Not like it's my fault.

00:00:52.093 --> 00:00:54.387 position:50% align:center
I haven't been doing
anything out of my norm.

00:00:54.471 --> 00:00:56.389 position:50% align:center
Hey, look at that,
mystery solved!

00:00:56.473 --> 00:00:58.725 position:50% align:center
Also, your diet
is out of control!

00:00:58.808 --> 00:01:00.101 position:50% align:center
If you want to make
a statement that says

00:01:00.185 --> 00:01:01.853 position:50% align:center
you don't need a
boyfriend, great.

00:01:01.936 --> 00:01:04.022 position:50% align:center
But don't blame me or
anyone else for noticing.

00:01:04.105 --> 00:01:05.607 position:50% align:center
Text me later.

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:07.442 position:50% align:center
Crap. Maybe I gained some.

00:01:07.525 --> 00:01:10.779 position:50% align:center
But I don't get why everyone's
so concerned about a number.

00:01:15.492 --> 00:01:16.743 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
Shut up, scale,

00:01:16.826 --> 00:01:19.829 position:50% align:center
you don't have to be
so rude about it.

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:26.586 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI] Enough is enough!
I'm going on a diet!

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.672 position:50% align:center
Starting tomorrow.

00:01:28.755 --> 00:01:30.840 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
This is Hibiki Sakura.

00:01:30.924 --> 00:01:33.551 position:50% align:center
Like many girls her age,
she turns to her refrigerator

00:01:33.635 --> 00:01:35.679 position:50% align:center
in times of stress and anxiety.

00:01:35.762 --> 00:01:38.848 position:50% align:center
But how will her life change
now that she's on a diet?

00:01:38.932 --> 00:01:41.017 position:50% align:center
She has no idea.

00:03:15.862 --> 00:03:17.197 position:50% align:center
[RECEPTIONIST]
Welcome, Miss Sakura!

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.324 position:50% align:center
Congratulations on your
decision to change your life!

00:03:19.407 --> 00:03:20.700 position:50% align:center
Ready for your tour?

00:03:20.784 --> 00:03:22.952 position:50% align:center
Yup. Let's do it.

00:03:23.036 --> 00:03:24.996 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI] I was really hoping I
wouldn't have to spend money

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.249 position:50% align:center
on something so basic.
But I'm out of options.

00:03:28.333 --> 00:03:29.918 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
She's not exaggerating.

00:03:30.001 --> 00:03:32.504 position:50% align:center
This past week she jogged
around her neighborhood

00:03:32.587 --> 00:03:36.466 position:50% align:center
and promptly quit
after two days.

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:40.428 position:50% align:center
She then tried a few days of
at-home strength training.

00:03:40.512 --> 00:03:43.973 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI] I just get bored and
can't stay motivated on my own.

00:03:44.057 --> 00:03:46.518 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] Her failures made her
the perfect marketing target

00:03:46.601 --> 00:03:48.728 position:50% align:center
for the newly built
Silverman sports gym

00:03:48.812 --> 00:03:51.981 position:50% align:center
offering free enrollment
for first-time visitors.

00:03:54.651 --> 00:03:55.902 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
All I know is this place better

00:03:55.985 --> 00:03:57.654 position:50% align:center
not smell like
dirty sweat socks.

00:03:57.737 --> 00:04:00.031 position:50% align:center
And if there's a bunch of shiny
dudes grunting like pigs,

00:04:00.115 --> 00:04:01.282 position:50% align:center
I'm out.

00:04:01.366 --> 00:04:02.784 position:50% align:center
[RECEPTIONIST] Oh, that's right!
I almost forgot!

00:04:02.867 --> 00:04:04.869 position:50% align:center
There's another girl here.
I think she's from your school.

00:04:04.953 --> 00:04:06.746 position:50% align:center
You're at Koyo Women's
Academy, right?

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:08.373 position:50% align:center
Yeah, who is it?

00:04:08.456 --> 00:04:09.416 position:50% align:center
Over there.

00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:10.834 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
Please be someone I know

00:04:10.917 --> 00:04:12.836 position:50% align:center
who's just as nervous and
awkward about this as me.

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:15.380 position:50% align:center
It would be so great to
not have to do this alone.

00:04:15.463 --> 00:04:16.798 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI gasps]

00:04:16.881 --> 00:04:18.550 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
Perfect shiny black hair.

00:04:18.633 --> 00:04:20.719 position:50% align:center
Stunning, freakishly blue eyes.

00:04:20.802 --> 00:04:23.930 position:50% align:center
Get outta here with
that perfect runway body!

00:04:26.683 --> 00:04:27.684 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
Seriously.

00:04:27.767 --> 00:04:29.519 position:50% align:center
What's <i>she</i> doing here?

00:04:32.063 --> 00:04:33.565 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
Akemi Soryuin.

00:04:33.648 --> 00:04:36.234 position:50% align:center
Perfect at everything: School,
sports, being hot, being nice,

00:04:36.317 --> 00:04:38.028 position:50% align:center
getting elected student council
president every year,

00:04:38.111 --> 00:04:39.696 position:50% align:center
voted Miss Koyo twice!

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:43.408 position:50% align:center
Plus everyone knows her parents
are offensively loaded!

00:04:43.491 --> 00:04:45.201 position:50% align:center
Yeah, we're prob'ly
not on the same journey

00:04:45.285 --> 00:04:46.995 position:50% align:center
to becoming our best selves.

00:04:47.078 --> 00:04:49.414 position:50% align:center
I can actually feel self-esteem
sweating out of me

00:04:49.497 --> 00:04:52.792 position:50% align:center
just standing here. Why couldn't
it have been anyone else?

00:04:52.876 --> 00:04:53.918 position:50% align:center
Hey, there!

00:04:54.002 --> 00:04:55.420 position:50% align:center
You're Hibiki from
Class B, aren't you?

00:04:55.503 --> 00:04:57.505 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI yelps]
That's me!

00:04:57.589 --> 00:04:58.715 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI]
Thank goodness!

00:04:58.798 --> 00:05:00.592 position:50% align:center
I was hoping I would
know someone else here!

00:05:00.675 --> 00:05:02.052 position:50% align:center
Is this your first day?

00:05:02.135 --> 00:05:03.636 position:50% align:center
Uh, for what? Oh!

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.138 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I guess so!

00:05:05.221 --> 00:05:06.431 position:50% align:center
Well, for here...

00:05:06.514 --> 00:05:08.433 position:50% align:center
I exercise other
places all the time.

00:05:08.516 --> 00:05:10.268 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI]
What? Please work out with me!

00:05:10.352 --> 00:05:12.020 position:50% align:center
It's so hard to make
friends who get it!

00:05:12.103 --> 00:05:14.773 position:50% align:center
Exercise is the key to our
entire life's happiness!

00:05:14.856 --> 00:05:17.442 position:50% align:center
Did you know that less
than 30% of all women

00:05:17.525 --> 00:05:19.402 position:50% align:center
can commit to exercising
just twice a week

00:05:19.486 --> 00:05:21.780 position:50% align:center
for at least 30 minutes
a day each year?

00:05:21.863 --> 00:05:23.490 position:50% align:center
Wow, that's so sad?

00:05:23.573 --> 00:05:24.699 position:50% align:center
I know, right?

00:05:24.783 --> 00:05:26.993 position:50% align:center
I can't imagine my world
without endorphins!

00:05:27.077 --> 00:05:30.580 position:50% align:center
Your body is yours for life,
so you must respect it.

00:05:30.663 --> 00:05:31.998 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
And I'm over it.

00:05:32.082 --> 00:05:34.626 position:50% align:center
I don't need friends.
I don't need this gym.

00:05:34.709 --> 00:05:36.252 position:50% align:center
I love my cellulite.

00:05:36.336 --> 00:05:37.587 position:50% align:center
All right, ladies, you ready?

00:05:37.671 --> 00:05:39.714 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna introduce you
to some of our trainers!

00:05:39.798 --> 00:05:40.715 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI]
We're so ready!

00:05:40.799 --> 00:05:41.633 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:05:41.716 --> 00:05:43.134 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
Trainers?

00:05:43.218 --> 00:05:47.806 position:50% align:center
I thought this was just supposed
to be a super chill tour!

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:50.725 position:50% align:center
Hope they don't expect us
to be on the same skill level.

00:05:50.809 --> 00:05:53.144 position:50% align:center
Whatever. I'm overthinking.

00:05:53.228 --> 00:05:56.022 position:50% align:center
[RECEPTIONIST] This is where
the training room is.

00:05:56.106 --> 00:05:59.484 position:50% align:center

The hell is going on in here?

Isn't this supposed
to be one of those

00:06:23.466 --> 00:06:26.136 position:50% align:center
pumpkin spice health clubs
for pretty people?

to what I wanted to sign up for!

00:06:45.905 --> 00:06:47.198 position:50% align:center
I thought I might shed a few,

00:06:47.282 --> 00:06:49.117 position:50% align:center
not transform into a
blonde muscle head!

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:50.785 position:50% align:center
This was a mistake!

00:06:50.869 --> 00:06:52.454 position:50% align:center
Hey, Akemi.

00:06:52.537 --> 00:06:55.874 position:50% align:center

I wanna sign up now!

[HIBIKI]
That was fast!

00:07:22.317 --> 00:07:24.486 position:50% align:center
Just so she can look
at their back-abs?

00:07:24.569 --> 00:07:26.488 position:50% align:center
Have fun with that.
I gotta get out of here

00:07:26.571 --> 00:07:28.907 position:50% align:center
before one of 'em flexes
and breaks my nose.

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:30.367 position:50% align:center

That's all it takes.

00:07:55.975 --> 00:07:59.020 position:50% align:center
Good hair, clean track suit,

00:08:01.773 --> 00:08:04.442 position:50% align:center
Hibiki, you wanna hang
out after school?

00:08:04.526 --> 00:08:06.945 position:50% align:center
I can't. I kinda got plans.

00:08:07.028 --> 00:08:09.114 position:50% align:center
Since when?
Are you dating someone?

00:08:09.197 --> 00:08:10.198 position:50% align:center
Not today.

00:08:10.281 --> 00:08:11.783 position:50% align:center
You got a part time job,
then? Tell me!

A job? Ew, no!

00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:18.665 position:50% align:center

What am I doing here?

00:08:33.346 --> 00:08:34.931 position:50% align:center
Maybe I should wear
a shirt that says,

00:08:35.015 --> 00:08:36.725 position:50% align:center
"I know how it looks,
but I'm not lost."

00:08:36.808 --> 00:08:39.394 position:50% align:center
Hello, Hibiki!
How was your day today?

00:08:39.477 --> 00:08:41.855 position:50% align:center
"How was your day?"
You sound like my mom.

00:08:41.938 --> 00:08:43.606 position:50% align:center
Oh my gosh, I didn't mean to!

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:45.233 position:50% align:center

There she is. Much better.

[AKEMI laughs]

00:08:46.818 --> 00:08:49.112 position:50% align:center
So, what gym were
you going to before

00:08:49.195 --> 00:08:50.488 position:50% align:center
you stumbled across this one?

00:08:50.572 --> 00:08:52.240 position:50% align:center
Just one my sister went to.

00:08:52.323 --> 00:08:54.075 position:50% align:center
But I'd heard great
things about Silverman

00:08:54.159 --> 00:08:56.119 position:50% align:center
so I was stoked when
they built one by me.

00:08:56.202 --> 00:08:58.288 position:50% align:center
Wow, your sister's a lifter?

00:08:58.371 --> 00:08:59.622 position:50% align:center
I bet it's easier to stick to

00:08:59.706 --> 00:09:01.041 position:50% align:center
when you have that
kind of support.

00:09:01.124 --> 00:09:03.585 position:50% align:center
She's always given me
the best advice.

00:09:03.668 --> 00:09:05.754 position:50% align:center
She said, "men won't
judge you by your face,

00:09:05.837 --> 00:09:08.548 position:50% align:center
but by the strength and size
of your boxer muscle."

00:09:08.631 --> 00:09:10.675 position:50% align:center
Then muscle fever
runs in your family?

00:09:10.759 --> 00:09:13.011 position:50% align:center
Oh my god, stop blushing!

00:09:13.094 --> 00:09:14.596 position:50% align:center

How do I let her down gently?

00:09:14.679 --> 00:09:17.724 position:50% align:center
We are just not gonna work out.
But that doesn't mean

00:09:17.807 --> 00:09:20.894 position:50% align:center

enjoy coming here!

both of you today! You ready?

00:09:27.484 --> 00:09:29.611 position:50% align:center

So ready Mr. Machio.

[HIBIKI gasps]
Hey girl, I see you.

00:09:32.489 --> 00:09:35.325 position:50% align:center
That is a look of lust
if I ever saw one.

00:09:35.408 --> 00:09:36.868 position:50% align:center
Busted!

00:09:36.951 --> 00:09:39.371 position:50% align:center
You're here for that Machio
meat, too, and I ain't even mad!

you to want to climb him.

Great, then let's get started!

00:09:45.835 --> 00:09:47.629 position:50% align:center
I think we should do some
bench presses first!

Me again! Muscle-bro Machio!

00:09:55.178 --> 00:09:57.013 position:50% align:center
And today I'm going to
show you the correct way

00:09:57.097 --> 00:09:59.391 position:50% align:center
to do a few different exercises
with the bench press!

00:09:59.474 --> 00:10:01.685 position:50% align:center
No one told me this was
an infotainment anime!

00:10:01.768 --> 00:10:04.020 position:50% align:center
[MACHIO] First, let's make sure
you're using the correct form.

00:10:04.104 --> 00:10:05.313 position:50% align:center
Eyes should be
level with the bar,

00:10:05.397 --> 00:10:06.690 position:50% align:center
and no fingers pointing out.

00:10:06.773 --> 00:10:08.108 position:50% align:center
Squeeze your shoulder
blades together

00:10:08.191 --> 00:10:10.151 position:50% align:center
to support the spine
and isolate the chest.

00:10:10.235 --> 00:10:12.696 position:50% align:center
Straighten your arms to lift
the bar over the safety rack.

00:10:12.779 --> 00:10:14.406 position:50% align:center
Keep your wrists straight
as you lower the bar

00:10:14.489 --> 00:10:16.032 position:50% align:center
over your mid-chest
on an inhale.

00:10:16.116 --> 00:10:17.534 position:50% align:center
Exhale and push the bar up,

00:10:17.617 --> 00:10:19.577 position:50% align:center
keeping it directly over
that mid-chest line.

00:10:19.661 --> 00:10:22.163 position:50% align:center
This complete movement
equals one repetition.

00:10:22.247 --> 00:10:23.957 position:50% align:center
Keep your abs tight,
even on the exhale,

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:25.500 position:50% align:center
to support that lower spine.

00:10:25.583 --> 00:10:28.253 position:50% align:center
Give them a poke to make sure
you're not just sucking in.

00:10:28.336 --> 00:10:30.505 position:50% align:center
Bench presses work out
your entire upper body,

00:10:30.588 --> 00:10:32.882 position:50% align:center
building strength and
inches in your arms,

00:10:32.966 --> 00:10:35.135 position:50% align:center
cutting up those deltoids,

00:10:35.218 --> 00:10:38.388 position:50% align:center
and strengthening and
defining your pectorals.

00:10:38.471 --> 00:10:41.641 position:50% align:center
They're also great for creating
a natural lift for your ladies!

00:10:41.725 --> 00:10:44.019 position:50% align:center
You're clearly more interested
in entertaining horn-dog viewers

00:10:44.102 --> 00:10:45.186 position:50% align:center
than helping us succeed!

00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:47.063 position:50% align:center
All right, Miss Sakura,
step on over here.

00:10:47.147 --> 00:10:48.314 position:50% align:center
You can do the first set.

00:10:48.398 --> 00:10:49.315 position:50% align:center

Go on, it'll be fun!

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:53.737 position:50% align:center
We'll start light
then go up in weight.

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:56.448 position:50% align:center
Let's do three sets of
ten using just the bar.

00:10:56.531 --> 00:10:59.117 position:50% align:center
Why? Does it weigh,
like, hardly anything?

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:00.243 position:50% align:center
Twenty kilos.

00:11:00.326 --> 00:11:01.703 position:50% align:center

For just the bar?!

00:11:01.786 --> 00:11:03.788 position:50% align:center

you when you feel fatigued.

00:11:03.872 --> 00:11:05.331 position:50% align:center

00:11:31.983 --> 00:11:34.611 position:50% align:center
[MACHIO] Look at that!
You survived your first go!

00:11:34.694 --> 00:11:38.073 position:50% align:center
You just lifted 20 kilograms in
sets of seven, five, and three!

00:11:38.156 --> 00:11:40.200 position:50% align:center
You were lifting
junk food yesterday!

00:11:40.283 --> 00:11:42.077 position:50% align:center

weights on top of that?

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:43.244 position:50% align:center
There's no reason any human

00:11:43.328 --> 00:11:44.621 position:50% align:center

I'm letting it win!

All right Miss thing,
you've done this before.

00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:50.710 position:50% align:center

00:11:50.794 --> 00:11:53.088 position:50% align:center

with 40 kilograms.

as much as me!

00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:38.169 position:50% align:center
I'm kinda freaked out.
That was just the first session.

00:14:38.253 --> 00:14:40.296 position:50% align:center
I can't do much
more beyond that.

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:42.507 position:50% align:center
What? Please don't quit, Hibiki.

00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:44.050 position:50% align:center
I promise it gets easier.

00:14:44.134 --> 00:14:46.469 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that's what you
all keep saying.

00:14:46.553 --> 00:14:48.680 position:50% align:center
I paid the membership fee,
so I hope you're right!

00:14:48.763 --> 00:14:51.641 position:50% align:center
Oh good, you'll see soon.

00:14:55.645 --> 00:14:57.439 position:50% align:center
I love how this worked out.

00:14:57.522 --> 00:15:00.150 position:50% align:center
The last gym I went to
was so far away.

00:15:00.233 --> 00:15:01.651 position:50% align:center
No members my age.

00:15:01.735 --> 00:15:05.280 position:50% align:center
I would never expect to run into
anyone I knew from school.

00:15:07.657 --> 00:15:09.034 position:50% align:center
Thank you!

00:15:09.117 --> 00:15:11.453 position:50% align:center
It's been so long since I
had an accountability buddy!

00:15:11.536 --> 00:15:13.163 position:50% align:center
We won't compare the
amount of weight lifted

00:15:13.246 --> 00:15:14.456 position:50% align:center
since I've been doing it longer.

00:15:14.539 --> 00:15:15.749 position:50% align:center
Maybe just reps or something?

00:15:15.832 --> 00:15:16.833 position:50% align:center
Twice a week?

00:15:16.916 --> 00:15:18.376 position:50% align:center
Whoa! Twice a week?

00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:20.879 position:50% align:center
I'm still processing that I paid
money to go to a gym at all.

00:15:20.962 --> 00:15:22.839 position:50% align:center
I just wanna lose some weight,
not "get swole."

00:15:22.922 --> 00:15:25.342 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI] Come on, it's too early
for you to say that.

00:15:25.425 --> 00:15:27.510 position:50% align:center
Here, have some protein shake
and feed your muscles.

00:15:27.594 --> 00:15:30.138 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI] I'm good with
actual food, thanks!

00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:33.558 position:50% align:center
[TACHIBANA] Thus Julianus set
about revoking Christianity's

00:15:33.641 --> 00:15:36.436 position:50% align:center
special status, and that
earned him the name

00:15:36.519 --> 00:15:38.563 position:50% align:center
"the Apostate,"
that we use today.

00:15:38.646 --> 00:15:41.024 position:50% align:center
Can I get a volunteer
to read the next part?

00:15:41.107 --> 00:15:42.025 position:50% align:center
Hibiki Sakura?

00:15:42.108 --> 00:15:44.611 position:50% align:center
Uh! Sure thing!

00:15:44.694 --> 00:15:46.654 position:50% align:center
[TACHIBANA]
Miss Sakura? Are you okay?

00:15:46.738 --> 00:15:49.491 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
Uh, I dunno. I hope so!

00:15:49.574 --> 00:15:51.993 position:50% align:center
Seriously? You look like
you're about to drop.

00:15:52.077 --> 00:15:55.080 position:50% align:center
Yeah, guess I went a little
bit overboard yesterday.

00:15:55.163 --> 00:15:56.790 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
Common newbie mistake.

00:15:56.873 --> 00:15:59.501 position:50% align:center
They push too hard to impress
a trainer and then end up

00:15:59.584 --> 00:16:01.378 position:50% align:center
in recovery for the
majority of the week.

00:16:01.461 --> 00:16:05.090 position:50% align:center
What was I thinking? I can't
hang with these gym cats.

00:16:09.135 --> 00:16:11.846 position:50% align:center
Ugh. Man, why's it so
frikkin hot this year?

00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:15.350 position:50% align:center
Uh, who knows?

00:16:15.433 --> 00:16:17.727 position:50% align:center
Whoa! Hibiki, what's
with your zipper?

00:16:17.811 --> 00:16:19.604 position:50% align:center
You're literally
spilling out all over!

00:16:19.688 --> 00:16:20.855 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:16:20.939 --> 00:16:22.649 position:50% align:center
Dude, look at your ass
cheeks--and your thighs.

00:16:22.732 --> 00:16:23.775 position:50% align:center
What's going on?

00:16:23.858 --> 00:16:25.360 position:50% align:center
You look like you're
about to explode?

00:16:25.443 --> 00:16:27.987 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI] Stop freaking out like
I'm covered in strips of TNT!

00:16:28.071 --> 00:16:29.823 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI] This sucks!
I thought my clothes

00:16:29.906 --> 00:16:32.033 position:50% align:center
were feeling a little
more snug than usual!

00:16:32.117 --> 00:16:33.993 position:50% align:center
I figured it was this summer
uniform being made

00:16:34.077 --> 00:16:37.038 position:50% align:center
with lighter fabrics and
shrinking or something!

00:16:37.122 --> 00:16:38.164 position:50% align:center
That does it.

00:16:38.248 --> 00:16:40.166 position:50% align:center
I'm getting skinty
by summer vacation!

00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:42.669 position:50% align:center
All the boys at the beach
will be stanning me hard!

00:16:42.752 --> 00:16:46.006 position:50% align:center
After this popsicle,
I'm going to the gym!

00:16:46.089 --> 00:16:48.383 position:50% align:center
Ready? I think we're gonna
do some squats today.

00:16:48.466 --> 00:16:50.301 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI] Can you please
put some clothes on?

00:16:50.385 --> 00:16:51.511 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
Squats, huh?

00:16:51.594 --> 00:16:53.346 position:50% align:center
Sounds frightening and familiar.

00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:56.224 position:50% align:center
Like wrestling move-ish-thing?

00:16:56.307 --> 00:16:57.767 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
Hey, Mr. Machio?

00:16:57.851 --> 00:16:59.144 position:50% align:center
Did Akemi ever show up?

00:16:59.227 --> 00:17:00.729 position:50% align:center
Of course.

00:17:00.812 --> 00:17:02.856 position:50% align:center
She got here a little early so
I started with her before you.

00:17:02.939 --> 00:17:04.315 position:50% align:center
See? Squatsville!

00:17:04.399 --> 00:17:07.944 position:50% align:center
[grunting]

00:17:08.028 --> 00:17:10.155 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI] Again with the
pornographic grunting sounds.

00:17:10.238 --> 00:17:11.698 position:50% align:center
Why?

00:17:11.781 --> 00:17:13.533 position:50% align:center
I'm sure she was anxious to get
these squats out of the way.

00:17:13.616 --> 00:17:15.076 position:50% align:center
That's a squat?

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:17.328 position:50% align:center
Totally different from what I
imagined it would look like.

00:17:17.412 --> 00:17:19.039 position:50% align:center
[MACHIO] Squat form is one
of the hardest to learn

00:17:19.122 --> 00:17:22.167 position:50% align:center
because it doesn't feel natural,
and she nails it every time.

00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:24.711 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
Yeah, that looks painful.

00:17:24.794 --> 00:17:26.504 position:50% align:center
[MACHIO] We're going to
be doing half-squats.

00:17:26.588 --> 00:17:28.757 position:50% align:center
See how she's leading with
her glutes and sinking down

00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:30.884 position:50% align:center
until her thighs are
parallel with the floor?

00:17:30.967 --> 00:17:32.677 position:50% align:center
She's keeping the knees
above the ankles

00:17:32.761 --> 00:17:35.388 position:50% align:center
by placing her weight
on the heel of the foot.

00:17:35.472 --> 00:17:37.349 position:50% align:center
Be sure to exhale as you
come up until the knees

00:17:37.432 --> 00:17:39.976 position:50% align:center
are just slightly bent and then
immediately drop back down.

00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:41.478 position:50% align:center
That counts as "one."

00:17:41.561 --> 00:17:43.980 position:50% align:center
Squats work several large
muscles in a single movement.

00:17:44.064 --> 00:17:45.982 position:50% align:center
You can hit the quads,
hamstrings and buttocks

00:17:46.066 --> 00:17:48.026 position:50% align:center
all at the same time.
You can also target

00:17:48.109 --> 00:17:50.320 position:50% align:center
the inner thigh by taking
a narrower stance.

00:17:50.403 --> 00:17:51.780 position:50% align:center
Sounds to me like you
just wanna talk about

00:17:51.863 --> 00:17:53.573 position:50% align:center
thigh gaps and dipping it low.

00:17:53.656 --> 00:17:55.241 position:50% align:center
[MACHIO]
Ready, Miss Sakura? You're up!

00:17:55.325 --> 00:17:56.993 position:50% align:center
Yeah! Sure!

00:17:57.077 --> 00:17:59.371 position:50% align:center
Feels great. Get it!

00:17:59.454 --> 00:18:01.539 position:50% align:center
[MACHIO] Remember, correct
form is essential for squats

00:18:01.623 --> 00:18:03.500 position:50% align:center
to avoid injuries, so do
some in the mirror first

00:18:03.583 --> 00:18:06.419 position:50% align:center
and only add the bar once
you've memorized how it feels.

00:18:06.503 --> 00:18:08.797 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
Mm... 'Kay?

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:11.174 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI] So basically I'm just
sitting back, no weights,

00:18:11.257 --> 00:18:13.134 position:50% align:center
making faces in a mirror. Cool.

00:18:13.218 --> 00:18:15.011 position:50% align:center
Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.
I can handle that.

00:18:15.095 --> 00:18:17.097 position:50% align:center
You got this! Just breathe!

00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:18.807 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
Mock me, moans-a-lot.

00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:21.393 position:50% align:center
At least I'll be able to
walk properly tomorrow!

00:18:21.476 --> 00:18:22.936 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
Here we go, guys!

00:18:23.019 --> 00:18:24.896 position:50% align:center
One...

00:18:24.979 --> 00:18:26.648 position:50% align:center
Two...

00:18:26.731 --> 00:18:29.442 position:50% align:center
[MACHIO] Keep your thighs
parallel to the floor!

00:18:29.526 --> 00:18:33.488 position:50% align:center
Almost there! Drop it
down a little further!

00:18:33.571 --> 00:18:34.989 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
Eight...

00:18:35.073 --> 00:18:38.159 position:50% align:center
N-Nine...

00:18:38.243 --> 00:18:41.413 position:50% align:center
T-T-Ten!

00:18:43.498 --> 00:18:44.833 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI groans]

00:18:44.916 --> 00:18:46.876 position:50% align:center
Excellent! You feel that burn?

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:48.753 position:50% align:center
Yes. Make it stop! Please!

00:18:48.837 --> 00:18:51.214 position:50% align:center
Why is this so much harder
than lifting the heavy bar?

00:18:51.297 --> 00:18:53.717 position:50% align:center
Because it's squats!
They can be hella hard.

00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:55.552 position:50% align:center
They work several large
muscles all at once,

00:18:55.635 --> 00:18:56.970 position:50% align:center
and burn lots of calories!

00:18:57.053 --> 00:18:59.139 position:50% align:center
You gave me that exercise
without warning?

00:18:59.222 --> 00:19:01.725 position:50% align:center
Squats can be intense.
That's why so many people

00:19:01.808 --> 00:19:04.144 position:50% align:center
skip leg day and only
work their upper bodies.

00:19:04.227 --> 00:19:06.354 position:50% align:center
Those physiques are
very unbalanced.

00:19:06.438 --> 00:19:07.731 position:50% align:center
Where are you gonna
stack those gains

00:19:07.814 --> 00:19:09.315 position:50% align:center
without a strong foundation?

00:19:09.399 --> 00:19:11.526 position:50% align:center
That's the fastest way
to get chicken legs.

00:19:11.609 --> 00:19:13.486 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
I regret imagining this.

00:19:13.570 --> 00:19:15.947 position:50% align:center
Anyway, your body now knows
what the correct form

00:19:16.031 --> 00:19:17.323 position:50% align:center
for squats feels like.

00:19:17.407 --> 00:19:19.242 position:50% align:center
We'll try a few with the bar
after you've recovered.

00:19:19.325 --> 00:19:20.243 position:50% align:center
[yelps]

00:19:20.326 --> 00:19:21.578 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
Who is this monster?

00:19:21.661 --> 00:19:23.288 position:50% align:center
I'm already dead after
just ten of those

00:19:23.371 --> 00:19:25.582 position:50% align:center
and he's gonna scrape me off
the floor for more abuse?

00:19:25.665 --> 00:19:28.126 position:50% align:center
Just think of how sexy our
butt and thighs are gonna be

00:19:28.209 --> 00:19:29.711 position:50% align:center
in a couple of
months after this.

00:19:29.794 --> 00:19:31.212 position:50% align:center
I'm right here with you.

00:19:31.296 --> 00:19:32.839 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI gasps]

00:19:32.922 --> 00:19:35.050 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI] I almost forgot
this stuff is lethal!

00:19:35.133 --> 00:19:38.219 position:50% align:center
It'll make me slimmer.
And sexier!

00:19:38.303 --> 00:19:41.514 position:50% align:center
Let's do it!

00:19:41.598 --> 00:19:43.308 position:50% align:center
And one!

00:19:43.391 --> 00:19:44.559 position:50% align:center
That's two!

00:19:44.642 --> 00:19:46.269 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI] I always knew
that girl was fierce.

00:19:46.353 --> 00:19:48.688 position:50% align:center
[MACHIO]
That's youth for ya, am I right?

00:19:49.564 --> 00:19:52.734 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI] Is it over yet?
Today totally wore me out.

00:19:52.817 --> 00:19:54.986 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI laughs]
You were nailing it!

00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:57.113 position:50% align:center
I hope you're proud of
what you did in there!

00:19:57.197 --> 00:19:59.657 position:50% align:center
That's kinda weird
coming from you.

00:19:59.741 --> 00:20:01.534 position:50% align:center
I cry trying to
lift just the bar

00:20:01.618 --> 00:20:03.703 position:50% align:center
while you're stackin' on
the weights left and right.

00:20:03.787 --> 00:20:05.205 position:50% align:center
It takes time.

00:20:05.288 --> 00:20:07.457 position:50% align:center
Also, you're not working this
hard to make me stronger,

00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:09.167 position:50% align:center
are you? Who cares what I do?

00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:10.877 position:50% align:center
You're the one who's
trying to top yourself.

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:13.088 position:50% align:center
We just have to focus on
improving who we were yesterday!

00:20:13.171 --> 00:20:16.925 position:50% align:center
Okay, stop spitting up
memes. Oh my gosh!

00:20:17.008 --> 00:20:19.344 position:50% align:center
I think we're really close
to this great ramen place!

00:20:19.427 --> 00:20:20.595 position:50% align:center
Are you hungry?

00:20:20.679 --> 00:20:21.971 position:50% align:center
Not really.

00:20:22.055 --> 00:20:24.224 position:50% align:center
But there is something I've
been meaning to ask you.

00:20:24.307 --> 00:20:26.851 position:50% align:center
Have you been keeping track of
how many times a day you eat?

00:20:26.935 --> 00:20:29.229 position:50% align:center
Huh? Well, let's see, uh...

00:20:29.312 --> 00:20:31.356 position:50% align:center
Breakfast, lunch, and dinner
are the main players.

00:20:31.439 --> 00:20:33.441 position:50% align:center
And the rest of them would
be snacks, I guess.

00:20:33.525 --> 00:20:35.610 position:50% align:center
'Bout three or four
of those guys.

00:20:35.694 --> 00:20:36.861 position:50% align:center
Hold on.

00:20:36.945 --> 00:20:38.988 position:50% align:center
You're eating five or
six full meals a day?

00:20:39.072 --> 00:20:41.783 position:50% align:center
Don't you judge me!
I do what I want!

00:20:41.866 --> 00:20:44.494 position:50% align:center
And if I get hungry,
I'm gonna eat something!

00:20:44.577 --> 00:20:46.746 position:50% align:center
Look, you're right, and that's
why I'm working out, okay?

00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:48.164 position:50% align:center
I have to feed my muscles, yeah?

00:20:48.248 --> 00:20:49.874 position:50% align:center
You are amazing!

00:20:49.958 --> 00:20:52.419 position:50% align:center
I never thought I'd actually
meet someone like you in person!

00:20:52.502 --> 00:20:54.587 position:50% align:center
Your appetite is real,
it's raw, it's powerful!

00:20:54.671 --> 00:20:57.132 position:50% align:center
And you've used that power
for good! You're true a hero!

00:20:57.215 --> 00:20:57.966 position:50% align:center
Do you hear me?

00:20:58.049 --> 00:20:59.384 position:50% align:center
I sure do.

00:20:59.467 --> 00:21:01.219 position:50% align:center
Can't say I really get it,
but believe me, I hear ya.

00:21:01.302 --> 00:21:02.804 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI]
No matter how hard you work out,

00:21:02.887 --> 00:21:04.222 position:50% align:center
you still eat whatever you want

00:21:04.305 --> 00:21:05.640 position:50% align:center
and you don't let
it get you down.

00:21:05.724 --> 00:21:07.726 position:50% align:center
Food is the most important
element when you're trying

00:21:07.809 --> 00:21:10.311 position:50% align:center
to build muscle, and many
girls shy away from it.

00:21:10.395 --> 00:21:11.521 position:50% align:center
But not you!

00:21:11.604 --> 00:21:13.648 position:50% align:center
You're so full of
unharnessed potential!

00:21:13.732 --> 00:21:15.984 position:50% align:center
If you could teach me to master
the art of body building

00:21:16.067 --> 00:21:17.527 position:50% align:center
the way that you have,
I know we could become

00:21:17.610 --> 00:21:19.946 position:50% align:center
the strongest and bulkiest
female duo ever!

00:21:20.030 --> 00:21:21.531 position:50% align:center
Aw, hell no!

00:21:21.614 --> 00:21:25.243 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] And in that moment,
it become very clear to Hibiki

00:21:25.326 --> 00:21:26.953 position:50% align:center
that she'd joined
the wrong gym.

00:22:57.419 --> 00:22:58.420 position:50% align:center
Hey, guys!

00:22:58.503 --> 00:23:00.255 position:50% align:center
You ready to challenge
those muscles?

00:23:00.338 --> 00:23:02.173 position:50% align:center
How cool is this?
You can still get a workout

00:23:02.257 --> 00:23:04.009 position:50% align:center
without all that
distracting "story" stuff!

00:23:04.092 --> 00:23:05.719 position:50% align:center
I've got a "story" for ya.

00:23:05.802 --> 00:23:08.805 position:50% align:center
On today's episode, Hibiki
learned how to do squats.

00:23:08.888 --> 00:23:10.390 position:50% align:center
Keep an eye on your
knees and make sure

00:23:10.473 --> 00:23:12.559 position:50% align:center
they never stick out
past your toes.

00:23:12.642 --> 00:23:15.895 position:50% align:center
You're all set! Let's see
what else you've learned!

00:23:15.979 --> 00:23:16.938 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
One...

00:23:17.022 --> 00:23:19.274 position:50% align:center
Drop to a 90 degree
angle and hold.

00:23:19.357 --> 00:23:21.026 position:50% align:center
Thighs should be
parallel to the floor.

00:23:21.109 --> 00:23:22.736 position:50% align:center
Keep the weight on
your heels and come up

00:23:22.819 --> 00:23:24.946 position:50% align:center
until knees are just
slightly bent.

00:23:25.030 --> 00:23:26.448 position:50% align:center
Use a consistent rhythm.

00:23:26.531 --> 00:23:27.782 position:50% align:center
You've got ten of these.

00:23:27.866 --> 00:23:29.784 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI] This is the part
where it starts to suck.

00:23:29.868 --> 00:23:31.202 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI]
Just breath through it, Hibiki!

00:23:31.286 --> 00:23:33.121 position:50% align:center
You got this!

00:23:33.204 --> 00:23:34.998 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
Seven...

00:23:35.081 --> 00:23:37.250 position:50% align:center
Eight...

00:23:37.334 --> 00:23:39.711 position:50% align:center
Nine... Ow.

00:23:39.794 --> 00:23:41.212 position:50% align:center
Ten!

00:23:41.296 --> 00:23:43.214 position:50% align:center
Squats can be modified
for any level!

00:23:43.298 --> 00:23:45.258 position:50% align:center
Three sets of ten each leg day!

00:23:45.342 --> 00:23:46.760 position:50% align:center
And always remember...

00:23:46.843 --> 00:23:48.928 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
True strength comes from within!
