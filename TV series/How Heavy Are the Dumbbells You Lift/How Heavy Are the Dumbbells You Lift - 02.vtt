I'm going full beast-mode today
no matter what happens!

00:00:21.813 --> 00:00:23.106 position:50% align:center
I wonder....

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.608 position:50% align:center
Couldn't hurt to just look.

00:00:25.692 --> 00:00:29.195 position:50% align:center
It's been a while since I've
actually weighed myself.

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.156 position:50% align:center
Bet I've dropped it
like it's hot.

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:33.783 position:50% align:center
Ya know, now that I'm
a hardcore gym rat.

00:00:33.867 --> 00:00:35.035 position:50% align:center
And?

00:00:36.745 --> 00:00:38.163 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
Seriously?

00:00:38.246 --> 00:00:40.248 position:50% align:center
How'd I gain weight?!

00:02:15.552 --> 00:02:18.054 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] Despite exercising
more than ever before,

00:02:18.138 --> 00:02:19.848 position:50% align:center
Hibiki managed to gain weight--

00:02:19.931 --> 00:02:22.183 position:50% align:center
which hit her like
a train to the face.

00:02:22.267 --> 00:02:23.643 position:50% align:center

00:02:23.727 --> 00:02:24.978 position:50% align:center
What's going on?

00:02:25.061 --> 00:02:27.147 position:50% align:center
I've noticed that my body
feels a bit more solid.

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.318 position:50% align:center
All I wanted was to slim down,
not become Gorilla McGirlGuns.

00:02:32.402 --> 00:02:33.737 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
This is not okay!

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:37.240 position:50% align:center
I need to talk to
Mr. Machio like, now!

00:02:37.323 --> 00:02:38.450 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI]
You scared me.

00:02:38.533 --> 00:02:40.744 position:50% align:center
I thought this was about
some kind of injury.

00:02:40.827 --> 00:02:42.537 position:50% align:center
So you've noticed a
change in your physique,

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.539 position:50% align:center
but the scale pulled a
fast one on you, huh?

00:02:44.622 --> 00:02:45.665 position:50% align:center
That's actually a good sign

00:02:45.749 --> 00:02:47.042 position:50% align:center
that your muscles
are getting stronger

00:02:47.125 --> 00:02:49.210 position:50% align:center
and your fat percentage
is going down.

00:02:49.294 --> 00:02:50.712 position:50% align:center
Oh.

00:02:50.795 --> 00:02:52.589 position:50% align:center
[MACHIO] It's possible to weigh
more being fit and strong

00:02:52.672 --> 00:02:54.174 position:50% align:center
than when you have
excess body fat.

00:02:54.257 --> 00:02:56.009 position:50% align:center
What? Is this a joke?

00:02:56.092 --> 00:02:57.093 position:50% align:center
[MACHIO]
Of course not.

00:02:57.177 --> 00:02:58.428 position:50% align:center
As your muscles get stronger,

00:02:58.511 --> 00:03:00.055 position:50% align:center
you're naturally
going to weigh more.

00:03:00.138 --> 00:03:01.306 position:50% align:center
Fat's big, but light.

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:03.391 position:50% align:center
When you see it next to
equal amounts of muscle,

00:03:03.475 --> 00:03:06.436 position:50% align:center
muscle takes up less volume,
so it looks smaller.

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:08.730 position:50% align:center
Both of these guys
weigh the exact same,

00:03:08.813 --> 00:03:11.858 position:50% align:center
but the one on the left is
bigger and has less muscle mass.

00:03:11.941 --> 00:03:13.276 position:50% align:center
There are many programs and ads

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.445 position:50% align:center
claiming to help you lose
X amount of pant sizes

00:03:15.528 --> 00:03:17.155 position:50% align:center
in less than two months.

00:03:17.238 --> 00:03:18.740 position:50% align:center
Generally, those plans
are based around

00:03:18.823 --> 00:03:20.992 position:50% align:center
extreme dietary restrictions.

00:03:21.076 --> 00:03:22.911 position:50% align:center
Proper dieting and portion
control on its own

00:03:22.994 --> 00:03:24.454 position:50% align:center
isn't terrible.

00:03:24.537 --> 00:03:25.789 position:50% align:center
But?

00:03:25.872 --> 00:03:27.957 position:50% align:center
Be careful. Make sure you're
not extreme-dieting.

00:03:28.041 --> 00:03:30.460 position:50% align:center
You'll lose weight because
of the lack of nutrients.

00:03:30.543 --> 00:03:32.128 position:50% align:center
Since your muscles
need food to grow,

00:03:32.212 --> 00:03:34.381 position:50% align:center
if you're not eating
enough, they'll shrink.

00:03:34.464 --> 00:03:36.925 position:50% align:center
And that will result in
a slower metabolism.

00:03:37.008 --> 00:03:39.177 position:50% align:center
Usually, people return
to their regular diet

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.097 position:50% align:center
after they've met their goal,
and then gain the weight back.

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.973 position:50% align:center
But now with their
slower metabolism,

00:03:44.057 --> 00:03:46.393 position:50% align:center
it's even harder to lose it
the next time around.

00:03:46.476 --> 00:03:48.978 position:50% align:center
That's so unfair!
This whole thing is a trap!

00:03:49.062 --> 00:03:51.398 position:50% align:center
Just know there's no fast
way to reach your goals.

00:03:51.481 --> 00:03:53.066 position:50% align:center
Regular exercise
and a balanced diet

00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:55.443 position:50% align:center
are the keys that unlock
that dream bod.

00:03:55.527 --> 00:03:57.904 position:50% align:center
If you get into the habit
of working out regularly,

00:03:57.987 --> 00:03:59.614 position:50% align:center
your body will change
at a healthy pace

00:03:59.698 --> 00:04:02.200 position:50% align:center
without the need
for extreme dieting.

00:04:02.283 --> 00:04:04.369 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I guess that makes sense.

00:04:04.452 --> 00:04:05.578 position:50% align:center
There are many different diets

00:04:05.662 --> 00:04:07.497 position:50% align:center
that can be effective
without exercise,

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:09.416 position:50% align:center
but I personally think it
should be incorporated

00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:12.085 position:50% align:center
into your lifestyle for
reasons beyond your size.

00:04:12.168 --> 00:04:13.420 position:50% align:center
You're both still growing,

00:04:13.503 --> 00:04:15.463 position:50% align:center
and weight training
stimulates the bone density

00:04:15.547 --> 00:04:17.465 position:50% align:center
and joint support
needed later in life.

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:20.051 position:50% align:center
So just keep lifting and
eat loads of good things!

to use the lat pulldown machine.

00:04:54.502 --> 00:04:56.379 position:50% align:center
Let's start with
front pulldowns.

00:04:56.463 --> 00:04:59.799 position:50% align:center
Make a goal post with your arms,
reach up and grab the bar,

00:04:59.883 --> 00:05:01.760 position:50% align:center
and pull it down to
your mid-chest line,

00:05:01.843 --> 00:05:03.636 position:50% align:center
while leaning back slightly.

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.348 position:50% align:center
Slowly return the bar
to its original position

00:05:06.431 --> 00:05:07.891 position:50% align:center
without relaxing your grip.

00:05:07.974 --> 00:05:09.934 position:50% align:center
Intensify the isolation
by squeezing

00:05:10.018 --> 00:05:11.978 position:50% align:center
the shoulder blades together
as you pulldown,

00:05:12.062 --> 00:05:14.481 position:50% align:center
and keeping them engaged
as you return the bar.

00:05:14.564 --> 00:05:17.275 position:50% align:center
Lat pulldowns are great for
working central back muscles

00:05:17.359 --> 00:05:20.403 position:50% align:center
like the latissimus dorsi

Most people who start
training close to summer

00:05:55.939 --> 00:05:57.315 position:50% align:center
are afraid to lift heavy weights

00:05:57.399 --> 00:05:59.984 position:50% align:center
because they don't want it
to make them look too bulky.

00:06:00.068 --> 00:06:01.903 position:50% align:center
But the thing is,
that's impossible.

00:06:01.986 --> 00:06:03.780 position:50% align:center

why not try working
on muscular endurance?

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:19.212 position:50% align:center
Instead of stacking the
weight for larger muscles,

00:06:19.295 --> 00:06:21.881 position:50% align:center
do several reps with lighter
weights to increase stamina.

00:06:21.965 --> 00:06:23.508 position:50% align:center

Oh, cool!

00:06:25.844 --> 00:06:27.804 position:50% align:center

00:06:30.015 --> 00:06:31.725 position:50% align:center
Make sure to start out
with a weight light enough

00:06:31.808 --> 00:06:34.144 position:50% align:center

By the way, there's another
exercise for your back.

After your workout, you need
to eat something with protein

00:07:48.927 --> 00:07:50.095 position:50% align:center
to heal your muscles.

00:07:50.178 --> 00:07:52.681 position:50% align:center
But make sure that you
do it within 30 minutes.

00:07:52.764 --> 00:07:55.266 position:50% align:center
What? Only 30 minutes?

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:57.394 position:50% align:center
I guess it's possible
if you don't shower off

00:07:57.477 --> 00:07:58.395 position:50% align:center
or wanna look cute.

00:07:58.478 --> 00:08:00.355 position:50% align:center
[chuckles] It cuts it close!

00:08:00.438 --> 00:08:03.274 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI] My muscles are
about to get wasted.

00:08:03.358 --> 00:08:04.859 position:50% align:center
Oh my gosh!

00:08:04.943 --> 00:08:07.445 position:50% align:center
I know where we can go to get
some real protein after this!

00:08:07.529 --> 00:08:08.947 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI]
Uh-huh.

00:08:13.743 --> 00:08:15.912 position:50% align:center
Yas! That's what
I'm talkin' about!

00:08:15.995 --> 00:08:18.415 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI]
This is a little extreme.

00:08:18.498 --> 00:08:20.792 position:50% align:center
[WAITER A] I wonder if she's one
of those competitive eaters.

00:08:20.875 --> 00:08:22.919 position:50% align:center
If so, she's good.

00:08:24.421 --> 00:08:25.839 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
Hibiki hasn't realized

00:08:25.922 --> 00:08:28.925 position:50% align:center
that there are other reasons
she hasn't lost weight yet.

00:08:29.009 --> 00:08:30.635 position:50% align:center
[laughing]

00:08:32.429 --> 00:08:33.888 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI]
Hey, Hibiki! How are you?

00:08:33.972 --> 00:08:35.390 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
No complaints!

00:08:35.473 --> 00:08:37.058 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI] Cool. What time are
you going to the gym today?

00:08:37.142 --> 00:08:38.685 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
I dunno, I mean,

00:08:38.768 --> 00:08:41.855 position:50% align:center
I wanna go, but my body's
pretty pissed about yesterday.

00:08:41.938 --> 00:08:44.024 position:50% align:center
I think I overdid it.

00:08:44.107 --> 00:08:45.942 position:50% align:center
I'm surprised I was able
to hear the phone ring

00:08:46.026 --> 00:08:47.527 position:50% align:center
over my screaming muscles.

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:50.155 position:50% align:center
Oh. Yeah, that doesn't
sound very fun.

00:08:50.238 --> 00:08:51.906 position:50% align:center
You have to be careful
not to push too hard

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:53.491 position:50% align:center
or you're gonna burn out.

00:08:53.575 --> 00:08:56.619 position:50% align:center
If your body is telling you to
rest, you should listen to it.

00:08:56.703 --> 00:08:57.871 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
Hmm...

00:08:57.954 --> 00:08:59.581 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I guess so.

00:08:59.664 --> 00:09:03.168 position:50% align:center
Just sucks to have to spend an
entire Sunday laying around.

00:09:03.251 --> 00:09:05.170 position:50% align:center
I'm off work today, too.

00:09:05.253 --> 00:09:06.671 position:50% align:center
You can still do things.

00:09:06.755 --> 00:09:09.299 position:50% align:center
What did you do on Sundays
before you started working out?

00:09:09.382 --> 00:09:10.842 position:50% align:center
It's been so long.

00:09:10.925 --> 00:09:13.803 position:50% align:center
My bestie and I usually just go
to the movies or something.

00:09:13.887 --> 00:09:15.055 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI]
That sounds fun.

00:09:15.138 --> 00:09:16.348 position:50% align:center
But today she was like, "no,"

00:09:16.431 --> 00:09:18.516 position:50% align:center
'cause she has to do chores
at home or whatev.

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:20.060 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI]
Well, if you want,

00:09:20.143 --> 00:09:22.020 position:50% align:center
we could do a lighter
workout today.

00:09:22.103 --> 00:09:23.229 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:09:24.731 --> 00:09:26.191 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
Oh, man!

00:09:26.274 --> 00:09:29.110 position:50% align:center
I forgot we could hang at the
pool and call it "exercise"!

00:09:29.194 --> 00:09:31.112 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI] Swimming is
a low impact exercise

00:09:31.196 --> 00:09:33.239 position:50% align:center
that works every muscle
in your body.

00:09:33.323 --> 00:09:35.950 position:50% align:center
It's easy to adjust the amount
of resistance you use,

00:09:36.034 --> 00:09:37.369 position:50% align:center
and lots of people
who weight train

00:09:37.452 --> 00:09:39.621 position:50% align:center
like to use it as their
active rest activity.

00:09:39.704 --> 00:09:42.082 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I can see why.

00:09:42.165 --> 00:09:43.249 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
I wanna die.

00:09:43.333 --> 00:09:45.377 position:50% align:center
Can she tell I wanna die?
Because I do.

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:47.921 position:50% align:center
My stupid swimsuit's too tight!

00:09:48.004 --> 00:09:50.632 position:50% align:center
I'm so glad we got here
before the swim class started.

00:09:50.715 --> 00:09:53.343 position:50% align:center
Note to self--
get a new suit ASAP.

00:09:53.426 --> 00:09:55.720 position:50% align:center
Ugh, it's so unfair.

00:09:58.390 --> 00:10:01.935 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI] Your bod is so sick
it makes me, well, sick.

00:10:02.018 --> 00:10:04.020 position:50% align:center
How are we the same age?
It doesn't make sense.

00:10:04.104 --> 00:10:04.896 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI gasps]

00:10:04.979 --> 00:10:06.481 position:50% align:center
Don't look at my arms! I know!

00:10:06.564 --> 00:10:08.608 position:50% align:center
Some parts are tight
and some are flabby!

00:10:08.692 --> 00:10:10.777 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI] Do I look like
a microscope to you?

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:13.530 position:50% align:center
Sorry for making it awkward.
I didn't mean to stare.

00:10:13.613 --> 00:10:15.615 position:50% align:center
I was just wondering if
after all this training,

00:10:15.699 --> 00:10:17.200 position:50% align:center
I'll get to look more like you.

00:10:17.283 --> 00:10:19.494 position:50% align:center
What? My muscles are
still developing!

00:10:19.577 --> 00:10:21.371 position:50% align:center
I feel like I look
kinda stringy.

00:10:21.454 --> 00:10:22.747 position:50% align:center
So let's keep training!

00:10:22.831 --> 00:10:25.083 position:50% align:center
Soon we'll both be
macho muscle babes!

00:10:25.166 --> 00:10:27.627 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI] I don't wanna
be "macho" anything.

00:10:27.711 --> 00:10:29.254 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI]
I have an idea!

00:10:29.337 --> 00:10:30.588 position:50% align:center
Choose someone out here.

00:10:30.672 --> 00:10:32.465 position:50% align:center
I bet we can tell their
preferred activity

00:10:32.549 --> 00:10:33.633 position:50% align:center
by their body type.

00:10:33.717 --> 00:10:35.343 position:50% align:center
How does that work?

00:10:35.427 --> 00:10:37.554 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI] Take that girl
over there, for example.

00:10:37.637 --> 00:10:41.016 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna say... she's
a competitive cyclist.

00:10:41.099 --> 00:10:42.308 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
Really? Why?

00:10:42.392 --> 00:10:43.727 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI] Her leg muscles
are more developed

00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:45.645 position:50% align:center
than any other part of her body.

00:10:45.729 --> 00:10:47.605 position:50% align:center
That's pretty typical
of cyclists.

00:10:47.689 --> 00:10:48.773 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
I can see that.

00:10:48.857 --> 00:10:50.650 position:50% align:center
It's just her legs, though.

00:10:50.734 --> 00:10:52.694 position:50% align:center
Ah! What if it's not that?

00:10:52.777 --> 00:10:55.488 position:50% align:center
Ya ever seen the thigh mountains
attached to a skier's legs?

00:10:55.572 --> 00:10:56.197 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI chuckles]

00:10:56.281 --> 00:10:57.699 position:50% align:center
How perceptive.

00:10:57.782 --> 00:11:00.076 position:50% align:center
I wasn't exactly 100% sure.

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:03.038 position:50% align:center
But look! She's definitely
got a biker's tan.

00:11:03.121 --> 00:11:04.080 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
Oh, snap!

00:11:04.164 --> 00:11:06.082 position:50% align:center
That also means
she trains outside.

00:11:06.166 --> 00:11:08.043 position:50% align:center
Some of them train
with spin class.

00:11:08.126 --> 00:11:11.129 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI] That's impressive.
And kinda creepy.

00:11:11.212 --> 00:11:13.715 position:50% align:center
You can tell all that just
by looking at her body?

00:11:13.798 --> 00:11:15.925 position:50% align:center
It's fun! Let's
try another one.

00:11:16.009 --> 00:11:17.719 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
How about her over there?

00:11:17.802 --> 00:11:19.387 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI] Her all-over
definition indicates

00:11:19.471 --> 00:11:21.931 position:50% align:center
some kind of active
body-weight class.

00:11:22.015 --> 00:11:23.600 position:50% align:center
Her knuckles are
raw and callused,

00:11:23.683 --> 00:11:26.644 position:50% align:center
which make me think it's karate
as opposed to boxing.

00:11:26.728 --> 00:11:28.188 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
All right, what about that girl

00:11:28.271 --> 00:11:29.814 position:50% align:center
chillin' in the sun over there?

00:11:29.898 --> 00:11:32.025 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI]
Her muscle mass is impressive.

00:11:32.108 --> 00:11:34.402 position:50% align:center
Especially her back
and upper arms.

00:11:34.486 --> 00:11:35.820 position:50% align:center
So maybe she does something with

00:11:35.904 --> 00:11:37.447 position:50% align:center
a lot of pulling and
throwing techniques

00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:39.282 position:50% align:center
like Judo or wrestling?

00:11:39.366 --> 00:11:41.284 position:50% align:center
You're like a body psychic!

00:11:41.368 --> 00:11:43.286 position:50% align:center
Hey, maybe you should
become a detective!

00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:46.790 position:50% align:center
Come on, they're just guesses.
I could totally be wrong.

00:11:46.873 --> 00:11:49.709 position:50% align:center
Aw, man, I'm inspired
by these fit bodies.

00:11:49.793 --> 00:11:51.753 position:50% align:center
Now I really wanna go work out!

00:11:51.836 --> 00:11:54.255 position:50% align:center
They better watch it
'cause I'm coming for 'em!

00:11:54.339 --> 00:11:56.466 position:50% align:center
So ready to get my swim on!

00:11:56.549 --> 00:11:57.967 position:50% align:center
First a little stretchy-stretch.

00:11:58.051 --> 00:11:59.052 position:50% align:center
Hibiki, no!

00:11:59.135 --> 00:12:00.595 position:50% align:center
Stop stretching immediately!

00:12:00.679 --> 00:12:01.846 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
Why? What's gonna happen?

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:03.390 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI]
You're not warmed up.

00:12:03.473 --> 00:12:05.892 position:50% align:center
Do you understand why we stretch
and when we need to stretch?

00:12:05.975 --> 00:12:07.727 position:50% align:center
Um, like, right now?

00:12:07.811 --> 00:12:09.479 position:50% align:center
Aren't we supposed to
stretch out our muscles

00:12:09.562 --> 00:12:12.190 position:50% align:center
before we exercise so that
we don't tear anything?

00:12:12.273 --> 00:12:14.609 position:50% align:center
A bunch of PE teachers
can't be wrong, can they?

00:12:14.693 --> 00:12:17.278 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI] I'm afraid, like many,
they were misinformed.

00:12:17.362 --> 00:12:18.279 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
Huh?

00:12:18.363 --> 00:12:19.155 position:50% align:center
Deep stretching
before you've done

00:12:19.239 --> 00:12:21.157 position:50% align:center
any other movement is pointless.

00:12:21.241 --> 00:12:24.327 position:50% align:center
It's more than that.
It can actually be harmful!

00:12:24.411 --> 00:12:25.829 position:50% align:center
What?!

00:12:25.912 --> 00:12:27.747 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI] Making your body stretch
before it's had the chance

00:12:27.831 --> 00:12:30.041 position:50% align:center
to warm up can lead to
painful snapped tendons

00:12:30.125 --> 00:12:31.584 position:50% align:center
and weakened joints.

00:12:31.668 --> 00:12:33.169 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
Holy crap!

00:12:33.253 --> 00:12:36.798 position:50% align:center
Aside from injuries, it can also
lower your performance level.

00:12:36.881 --> 00:12:39.968 position:50% align:center
According to research done by
the University of Zagreb,

00:12:40.051 --> 00:12:41.553 position:50% align:center
stretching for more
than 45 seconds

00:12:41.636 --> 00:12:43.847 position:50% align:center
before exercising
decreases strength.

00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:47.183 position:50% align:center
Your muscles weaken
by an average of 5.5%.

00:12:47.267 --> 00:12:49.686 position:50% align:center
Both explosive muscular
performance and jumping power

00:12:49.769 --> 00:12:51.813 position:50% align:center
are lowered by 3%.

00:12:51.896 --> 00:12:53.064 position:50% align:center
It was all lies!

00:12:53.148 --> 00:12:55.108 position:50% align:center
It doesn't loosen muscles,
it tightens them?

00:12:55.191 --> 00:12:56.609 position:50% align:center
How is that possible?

00:12:56.693 --> 00:12:58.737 position:50% align:center
Almost everyone at the gym
stretches before they work out!

00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:00.572 position:50% align:center
I know. Believe me.

00:13:00.655 --> 00:13:01.823 position:50% align:center
I see it all the time, too,

00:13:01.906 --> 00:13:03.700 position:50% align:center
because they still don't
know it's bad for you.

00:13:03.783 --> 00:13:05.410 position:50% align:center
It's a relatively new study.

00:13:05.493 --> 00:13:07.370 position:50% align:center
Well, that sucks, doesn't it?

00:13:07.454 --> 00:13:08.538 position:50% align:center
So does this new movement

00:13:08.621 --> 00:13:10.498 position:50% align:center
mean we don't do anything
before exercise?

00:13:10.582 --> 00:13:11.833 position:50% align:center
We just jump right in?

00:13:11.916 --> 00:13:13.293 position:50% align:center
No, not at all!

00:13:13.376 --> 00:13:16.588 position:50% align:center
We can now exchange it for
dynamic stretching instead!

00:13:16.671 --> 00:13:18.590 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
What does that even mean?

00:13:20.842 --> 00:13:23.219 position:50% align:center
'Kay, here's how
this works. Just watch.

00:13:23.303 --> 00:13:24.971 position:50% align:center
Combine smaller movements

00:13:25.055 --> 00:13:27.724 position:50% align:center
along with stretching
to warm up your body.

00:13:27.807 --> 00:13:29.476 position:50% align:center
This boosts muscle flexibility.

00:13:29.559 --> 00:13:30.727 position:50% align:center
Warming up like this is linked

00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:32.896 position:50% align:center
to improved performance
and injury prevention.

00:13:32.979 --> 00:13:34.522 position:50% align:center
Oh.

00:13:34.606 --> 00:13:37.108 position:50% align:center
Here's my recommended
warmup for any level.

00:13:37.192 --> 00:13:40.695 position:50% align:center
Shoulder circles front
and back, twice each way.

00:13:40.779 --> 00:13:43.573 position:50% align:center
Doing side bends will
stretch out your abs.

00:13:43.656 --> 00:13:46.201 position:50% align:center
Go back to shoulder
circles with elbows bent.

00:13:46.284 --> 00:13:48.953 position:50% align:center
This helps to stretch and loosen
up your shoulder blades.

00:13:49.037 --> 00:13:50.330 position:50% align:center
Toe touches.

00:13:50.413 --> 00:13:54.626 position:50% align:center
Alternate left and right to
stretch your hamstrings.

00:13:54.709 --> 00:13:55.752 position:50% align:center
What do you think?

00:13:55.835 --> 00:13:57.045 position:50% align:center
Does it feel
completely different

00:13:57.128 --> 00:13:58.546 position:50% align:center
from normal static stretches?

00:13:58.630 --> 00:14:00.382 position:50% align:center
Yeah! For sure!

00:14:00.465 --> 00:14:02.008 position:50% align:center
There's definitely
something to this.

00:14:02.092 --> 00:14:03.718 position:50% align:center
I'm feeling pretty
loose already.

00:14:03.802 --> 00:14:05.929 position:50% align:center
I'm so glad you can
tell the difference!

00:14:06.012 --> 00:14:09.224 position:50% align:center
Another thing. Have you ever
done any radio calisthenics?

00:14:09.307 --> 00:14:10.892 position:50% align:center
All of that is
dynamic stretching!

00:14:10.975 --> 00:14:13.895 position:50% align:center
Oh! I thought these
movements looked familiar!

00:14:13.978 --> 00:14:16.898 position:50% align:center
Fun, huh? So has your
heartrate increased enough?

00:14:16.981 --> 00:14:20.026 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah! I feel totally
warmed up now.

00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:22.904 position:50% align:center
Yeah, dynamic stretching
is where it's at!

00:14:22.987 --> 00:14:25.699 position:50% align:center
I feel like I've done a full
workout with just these guys.

00:14:25.782 --> 00:14:27.283 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna do it at
the gym next time.

00:14:33.456 --> 00:14:37.043 position:50% align:center
Gotta go. There's a
rip in my swimsuit.

00:14:37.127 --> 00:14:39.671 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI] I'll take you to
buy a new one. Let's go.

00:14:39.754 --> 00:14:40.964 position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:14:41.047 --> 00:14:43.216 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] One more thing,
when you stretch,

00:14:43.299 --> 00:14:46.136 position:50% align:center
make sure you're
wearing loose clothing.

00:14:51.599 --> 00:14:54.060 position:50% align:center
Ex-Special Forces, is it?

00:14:55.270 --> 00:14:57.397 position:50% align:center
The perfect appetizer.

A film starring

00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:17.584 position:50% align:center
This is part four
of an action series

00:15:17.667 --> 00:15:20.962 position:50% align:center
about an ex-elite mercenary
thrown into the past

00:15:21.046 --> 00:15:24.382 position:50% align:center
and forced to battle against
an evil guerilla army,

00:15:24.466 --> 00:15:26.384 position:50% align:center
all on his own.

00:15:26.468 --> 00:15:28.345 position:50% align:center

Hell yas!

00:15:33.892 --> 00:15:35.852 position:50% align:center
They answered every question,
blew up everyone I hate,

00:15:35.935 --> 00:15:38.396 position:50% align:center
made sense of every random side
plot, and I'm living for it!

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:40.899 position:50% align:center
Why the crap was this only
privately screened in Japan?

00:15:40.982 --> 00:15:42.359 position:50% align:center
"To be continued" means
they're definitely

00:15:42.442 --> 00:15:43.526 position:50% align:center
making a sequel, right?

00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:45.070 position:50% align:center
They're not just doing
it to be a-holes?

00:15:45.153 --> 00:15:47.197 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI] I dunno, I mean, the
one before turned out to be

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:48.490 position:50% align:center
just a dream in the end, right?

00:15:48.573 --> 00:15:49.866 position:50% align:center
[AYAKA]
We don't know that for sure!

00:15:49.949 --> 00:15:51.451 position:50% align:center
Wait, now that we
know what happens,

00:15:51.534 --> 00:15:52.827 position:50% align:center
let's watch all of them
from the beginning

00:15:52.911 --> 00:15:55.080 position:50% align:center
and see if we can catch
the clues this time!

00:15:55.163 --> 00:15:57.832 position:50% align:center
It's gonna be a long night!

This is Ayaka Uehara.

[HIBIKI]
No frikkin' way.

00:16:11.304 --> 00:16:14.641 position:50% align:center
Someone who actually
knows good movies?

00:16:14.724 --> 00:16:16.017 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
Now that I think about it,

00:16:16.101 --> 00:16:18.520 position:50% align:center
this is the first time I've
ever been to her house.

00:16:18.603 --> 00:16:21.856 position:50% align:center
Usually when we hang out,
we go see movies in the theater.

00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:23.650 position:50% align:center
[AYAKA]
Sweet! Found all of them.

00:16:23.733 --> 00:16:27.070 position:50% align:center
Cool! So, what order do
we want to watch 'em in?

00:16:27.153 --> 00:16:29.698 position:50% align:center
[AYAKA] We can go by release
date, or chronologically,

00:16:29.781 --> 00:16:33.451 position:50% align:center
which would be three,
four, two, then one.

00:16:33.535 --> 00:16:35.954 position:50% align:center
Sorry to bug you, but I need
your help real quick.

00:16:36.037 --> 00:16:37.872 position:50% align:center
[AYAKA]
What the crap, sis? Now?

00:16:37.956 --> 00:16:40.458 position:50% align:center
Oh. I guess you were
about to watch movies?

00:16:40.542 --> 00:16:42.085 position:50% align:center
[AYAKA] Yeah, I have a
friend over, so can you--?

00:16:42.168 --> 00:16:43.169 position:50% align:center
Nice to meet you.

00:16:43.253 --> 00:16:44.963 position:50% align:center
Yeah! Likewise.

00:16:45.046 --> 00:16:46.715 position:50% align:center
Why don't you bring her
and she can watch you?

00:16:46.798 --> 00:16:48.049 position:50% align:center
No.

00:16:48.133 --> 00:16:50.010 position:50% align:center
I was gonna pay you extra,
but whatever. Your loss.

00:16:50.093 --> 00:16:51.511 position:50% align:center
[AYAKA]
Wait! Hold on!

00:16:51.594 --> 00:16:53.013 position:50% align:center
Damn it.

00:16:53.096 --> 00:16:55.348 position:50% align:center
It's like she knows when I
wanna have a binge watch day.

00:16:55.432 --> 00:16:58.101 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, Hibiki. I gotta
go help her out for a bit.

00:16:58.184 --> 00:16:59.519 position:50% align:center
But I promise it
won't take long.

00:16:59.602 --> 00:17:01.563 position:50% align:center
Oh my gosh, it's totally fine!

00:17:01.646 --> 00:17:04.649 position:50% align:center
Wait, I don't think you ever
told me what your family does.

00:17:04.733 --> 00:17:05.984 position:50% align:center
Does the business have a name?

00:17:06.067 --> 00:17:07.152 position:50% align:center
[AYAKA]
Hm?

00:17:07.235 --> 00:17:08.403 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah! Weird.

00:17:08.486 --> 00:17:10.655 position:50% align:center
I can't believe we never
really talked about it.

00:17:10.739 --> 00:17:11.906 position:50% align:center
Why don't you come check it out?

00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:13.700 position:50% align:center
It's right behind my house.

00:17:18.413 --> 00:17:21.291 position:50% align:center
Almost! Wind up a little more!

00:17:21.374 --> 00:17:24.294 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI] This is not
what I expected at all.

00:17:24.377 --> 00:17:25.795 position:50% align:center
[NANA]
Hey there!

00:17:25.879 --> 00:17:28.381 position:50% align:center
Ayaka said she never talked
to you about all this, huh?

00:17:28.465 --> 00:17:29.799 position:50% align:center
Uh, no.

00:17:29.883 --> 00:17:32.469 position:50% align:center
[NANA] Our dad was a pro
boxer back in his day.

00:17:32.552 --> 00:17:35.347 position:50% align:center
After he retired,
he opened up this gym.

00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:38.600 position:50% align:center
He immediately made everyone
in the family learn how to box.

00:17:38.683 --> 00:17:40.477 position:50% align:center
So now, whenever
he's on vacation,

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:42.103 position:50% align:center
we step in as the coaches.

00:17:42.187 --> 00:17:43.521 position:50% align:center
That's pretty smart.

00:17:43.605 --> 00:17:45.273 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI] I remember Ayaka
saying she was part

00:17:45.357 --> 00:17:46.608 position:50% align:center
of a family business.

00:17:46.691 --> 00:17:49.319 position:50% align:center
I even remember her saying
she helps out sometimes.

00:17:49.402 --> 00:17:50.737 position:50% align:center
But she never,
ever once mentioned

00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:52.697 position:50% align:center
it was anything so hardcore.

00:17:52.781 --> 00:17:55.283 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI] You can feel how
passionate everyone is here.

00:17:55.367 --> 00:17:57.702 position:50% align:center
Are there a lotta
crazy-strong members?

00:17:57.786 --> 00:18:00.288 position:50% align:center
[NANA] Uh, I'm not
sure what that means.

00:18:00.372 --> 00:18:03.333 position:50% align:center
We do have a few world champions
who train here sometimes.

00:18:03.416 --> 00:18:07.045 position:50% align:center
Those are like the best
of the best. OMG.

00:18:07.128 --> 00:18:08.046 position:50% align:center

00:18:21.267 --> 00:18:23.186 position:50% align:center
You never told me you
were a boxer-boss!

00:18:23.269 --> 00:18:25.105 position:50% align:center
Is that the reason you like
all those action movies?

00:18:25.188 --> 00:18:26.981 position:50% align:center
Oh, no, that's so backwards.

00:18:27.065 --> 00:18:29.859 position:50% align:center
Movies in general came first.
That's my passion.

00:18:29.943 --> 00:18:32.112 position:50% align:center
My dad just made me
learn boxing for work.

00:18:32.195 --> 00:18:35.073 position:50% align:center
It's a gigantic pain in my ass.

00:18:35.156 --> 00:18:36.282 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
You say that, yet,

00:18:36.366 --> 00:18:38.284 position:50% align:center
here you are shuffle-jabbing
involuntarily

00:18:38.368 --> 00:18:40.787 position:50% align:center
like a prize fighter on deck.

00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:41.955 position:50% align:center
Shut up.

00:18:42.038 --> 00:18:45.750 position:50% align:center
Ayaka! Your abs
are frikkin' insane!

00:18:45.834 --> 00:18:48.044 position:50% align:center
What? They are?

00:18:48.128 --> 00:18:50.380 position:50% align:center
I'm not doing anything
extra in my workouts.

00:18:50.463 --> 00:18:52.007 position:50% align:center
You're not doing
millions of sit-ups?

00:18:52.090 --> 00:18:53.508 position:50% align:center
No, not even close.

00:18:53.591 --> 00:18:55.301 position:50% align:center
Let's see, if you wanna
work out your abs,

00:18:55.385 --> 00:18:57.429 position:50% align:center
do a few rounds of dragon flags!

00:18:57.512 --> 00:19:00.056 position:50% align:center
What's a dragon
flag? C'mon, spill!

00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:02.058 position:50% align:center
[AYAKA] Start by lying
on the floor like this,

00:19:02.142 --> 00:19:05.645 position:50% align:center
then reach behind you and grab
onto a pole or something sturdy.

00:19:05.729 --> 00:19:08.815 position:50% align:center
Then, bend both knees
slightly and lift up.

00:19:08.898 --> 00:19:11.818 position:50% align:center
And slowly lower yourself
back down and hover.

00:19:11.901 --> 00:19:14.446 position:50% align:center
Then back up keeping
your abs tight, hold,

00:19:14.529 --> 00:19:18.283 position:50% align:center
and back down and
hover above the floor.

00:19:18.366 --> 00:19:22.078 position:50% align:center
Try to keep a straight line,
back and legs aligned.

00:19:22.162 --> 00:19:23.621 position:50% align:center
Knees soft.

00:19:26.291 --> 00:19:28.752 position:50% align:center
I'd recommend starting
with three sets of ten of these.

00:19:28.835 --> 00:19:30.712 position:50% align:center
I can't even do one set
of one of those things!

00:19:30.795 --> 00:19:32.380 position:50% align:center
I'm just a mere
mortal over here!

00:19:32.464 --> 00:19:34.215 position:50% align:center
[AYAKA] Huh? I never
thought of dragon flags

00:19:34.299 --> 00:19:35.717 position:50% align:center
as some advanced move!

00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:38.011 position:50% align:center
That's because they're just
a regular sit-up at our gym.

00:19:38.094 --> 00:19:40.305 position:50% align:center
I thought everyone knew
how to do dragon flags.

00:19:40.388 --> 00:19:41.806 position:50% align:center
You mean there are some
people who don't?

00:19:41.890 --> 00:19:43.183 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI] I don't know where
you guys came from,

00:19:43.266 --> 00:19:44.642 position:50% align:center
but no one asked
for your opinion!

00:19:44.726 --> 00:19:46.811 position:50% align:center
And that's because none of
you can relate to "normal."

00:19:46.895 --> 00:19:48.229 position:50% align:center
[AYAKA]
Hm.

00:19:48.313 --> 00:19:50.231 position:50% align:center
I'm sure I know some other
exercises that will work.

00:19:50.315 --> 00:19:52.525 position:50% align:center
Just something simple and
straightforward, please.

00:19:52.609 --> 00:19:54.194 position:50% align:center
[AYAKA]
Oh! Duh.

00:19:54.277 --> 00:19:56.279 position:50% align:center
You can do planks. Done.

00:19:56.363 --> 00:19:57.572 position:50% align:center
What's that?

00:19:57.655 --> 00:19:59.324 position:50% align:center
[AYAKA]
Literally nothing to it.

00:19:59.407 --> 00:20:01.201 position:50% align:center
Create a straight line
with your body,

00:20:01.284 --> 00:20:02.744 position:50% align:center
supporting yourself
with your forearms

00:20:02.827 --> 00:20:05.955 position:50% align:center
and the balls of your feet,
and you just hold this posture.

00:20:06.039 --> 00:20:07.791 position:50% align:center
Keep your abs tight
the whole time.

00:20:07.874 --> 00:20:10.293 position:50% align:center
Arms at right angles.
Chin is neutral.

00:20:10.377 --> 00:20:12.462 position:50% align:center
Now hold the pose
for 30 seconds.

00:20:12.545 --> 00:20:13.630 position:50% align:center
Wanna try?

00:20:13.713 --> 00:20:15.882 position:50% align:center
What the--? Did you trick me?

00:20:15.965 --> 00:20:18.051 position:50% align:center
This is harder than
it looks. It hurts.

00:20:18.134 --> 00:20:20.845 position:50% align:center
You're fine. There's no pressure
anywhere on your back.

00:20:20.929 --> 00:20:22.555 position:50% align:center
Okay, that's 30 seconds!

00:20:22.639 --> 00:20:23.264 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI cries]

00:20:23.348 --> 00:20:24.391 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:24.474 --> 00:20:26.017 position:50% align:center
Hey, Hibiki, do you
wanna try hitting

00:20:26.101 --> 00:20:27.143 position:50% align:center
one of our punching bags?

00:20:27.227 --> 00:20:28.520 position:50% align:center
No thanks!

00:20:28.603 --> 00:20:30.230 position:50% align:center
[NANA] If your goal
is to burn body fat,

00:20:30.313 --> 00:20:32.357 position:50% align:center
then you gotta get
your cardio in, too.

00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:34.275 position:50% align:center
Don't make her do it
if she doesn't want to.

00:20:34.359 --> 00:20:35.527 position:50% align:center
[NANA]
She's fine!

00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:36.861 position:50% align:center
I'll guide you through it, okay?

00:20:36.945 --> 00:20:38.947 position:50% align:center
Uh. All right.

00:20:39.030 --> 00:20:40.699 position:50% align:center
It might be fun. Never know.

00:20:40.782 --> 00:20:42.867 position:50% align:center
That's what we like to hear!

00:20:54.379 --> 00:20:56.089 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:21:02.012 --> 00:21:04.723 position:50% align:center
Ah! Oh, no! I broke it!

00:21:04.806 --> 00:21:06.850 position:50% align:center
It's okay.

00:21:06.933 --> 00:21:09.561 position:50% align:center
Looks like I've got a
new champion to train.

00:21:09.644 --> 00:21:11.354 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI] What the heck
are you talking about?!

00:21:11.438 --> 00:21:12.772 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
And with one punch,

00:21:12.856 --> 00:21:15.942 position:50% align:center
Hibiki's hidden talent
came to light.

00:22:46.408 --> 00:22:48.535 position:50% align:center
Today we'll review
the plank exercise.

00:22:48.618 --> 00:22:50.620 position:50% align:center
Thanks to Miss Uehara
for showing it to us!

00:22:50.704 --> 00:22:52.455 position:50% align:center
This exercise is
so simple to do,

00:22:52.539 --> 00:22:54.541 position:50% align:center
so those of you at home
can do it with us.

00:22:54.624 --> 00:22:55.875 position:50% align:center
You guys ready?

00:22:55.959 --> 00:22:58.086 position:50% align:center
First, we'll review
the basic posture.

00:22:58.169 --> 00:23:00.588 position:50% align:center
Be sure to keep these points
in mind when doing a plank.

00:23:00.672 --> 00:23:03.258 position:50% align:center
Hold it for at least 30
seconds, like I did today.

00:23:03.341 --> 00:23:04.551 position:50% align:center
Let's hit those mats!

00:23:04.634 --> 00:23:07.345 position:50% align:center
Thirty seconds begins now.

00:23:07.429 --> 00:23:08.596 position:50% align:center
You don't want your
back to wobble,

00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:10.473 position:50% align:center
so be sure to engage your core.

00:23:10.557 --> 00:23:12.726 position:50% align:center
Focus on keeping your
body in a perfect line.

00:23:12.809 --> 00:23:14.269 position:50% align:center
Keep those abs nice and tight!

00:23:14.352 --> 00:23:15.770 position:50% align:center
Stay mindful of your form.

00:23:15.854 --> 00:23:18.273 position:50% align:center
Hold strong--still got
20 seconds to go!

00:23:18.356 --> 00:23:20.650 position:50% align:center
Don't let your back
compensate by arching up.

00:23:20.734 --> 00:23:22.152 position:50% align:center
[AYAKA] Straight line
from head to heels!

00:23:22.235 --> 00:23:23.194 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI grunts]

00:23:23.278 --> 00:23:24.654 position:50% align:center
It's starting to get
really hard now!

00:23:24.738 --> 00:23:26.740 position:50% align:center
That serves as proof
that it's working!

00:23:26.823 --> 00:23:28.116 position:50% align:center
Ten seconds!

00:23:28.199 --> 00:23:30.201 position:50% align:center
Just keep pulling your
abs in tighter! This sucks!

00:23:30.285 --> 00:23:31.494 position:50% align:center
Lookin' good! Breathe!

00:23:31.578 --> 00:23:33.496 position:50% align:center
[AYAKA] This is the time
when you have to fight!

00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:37.375 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Three, two, one, zero!

00:23:37.459 --> 00:23:39.669 position:50% align:center
And done!

00:23:39.753 --> 00:23:40.879 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI sighs]

00:23:40.962 --> 00:23:42.547 position:50% align:center
My entire core feels
completely destroyed!

00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:45.425 position:50% align:center
Planks are also excellent for
strength and balance training.

00:23:45.508 --> 00:23:47.010 position:50% align:center
And always remember:

00:23:47.093 --> 00:23:49.137 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
True strength comes from within!
