Oh, look! It's New Year's Eve!

00:00:26.026 --> 00:00:28.611 position:50% align:center

is fully complete.

The Battle song sung by
Sayu made it official.

Hey there, you guys ready to go?

00:00:38.997 --> 00:00:40.874 position:50% align:center
If not, we're leavin'
here without ya.

00:00:40.957 --> 00:00:42.834 position:50% align:center
Oh please, we were
waiting on you.

00:00:42.917 --> 00:00:44.252 position:50% align:center
Happy New Year's Day, friends!

00:00:44.336 --> 00:00:45.670 position:50% align:center
It's not time yet!

00:00:45.754 --> 00:00:47.881 position:50% align:center
And it's just "Happy
New Year!" No 'Day.'

00:00:47.964 --> 00:00:51.259 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] Mmm-kay. Let's go
see what the adults are doing!

[AINA, TACHIBANA]
Cheers!

Here's to another year with
the hotties in the mirror!

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:57.599 position:50% align:center
Yeah!

How no one has snatched up

00:01:03.688 --> 00:01:07.692 position:50% align:center
all this grace and
beauty is... beyond me.

00:02:43.455 --> 00:02:45.498 position:50% align:center
Guys! Where are you taking us?

00:02:45.582 --> 00:02:47.459 position:50% align:center
I don't think there's
a shrine around here.

00:02:47.542 --> 00:02:49.336 position:50% align:center
That's because you
didn't do your research,

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:51.588 position:50% align:center
so you don't know where
the perfect one is located.

00:02:51.671 --> 00:02:53.631 position:50% align:center
Ayaka and I went
scouting earlier.

00:02:53.715 --> 00:02:55.842 position:50% align:center
We found some lovely
shrines near here.

00:02:55.925 --> 00:02:58.970 position:50% align:center
You two are gonna love
the one we finally picked!

00:02:59.054 --> 00:03:00.805 position:50% align:center
I can't wait.

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.687 position:50% align:center
This is it! The shrine's
all the way up there!

00:03:09.105 --> 00:03:11.191 position:50% align:center
[BOTH] What's the point
of all of the stairs?

00:03:11.274 --> 00:03:12.817 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI]
This is Masura Shrine.

00:03:12.901 --> 00:03:15.070 position:50% align:center
It's supposed to have
a long history.

00:03:15.153 --> 00:03:17.072 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI] Did they add
a step for every year?

00:03:17.155 --> 00:03:18.615 position:50% align:center
Because that would
actually make sense.

00:03:18.698 --> 00:03:21.493 position:50% align:center
You can't even see the summit--
it's covered in clouds!

00:03:21.576 --> 00:03:24.579 position:50% align:center
Uh... Hey.

00:03:24.662 --> 00:03:27.082 position:50% align:center
What are those
dude-bros doing here?

00:03:27.165 --> 00:03:29.542 position:50% align:center
Are they gonna "flex"
in the new year?

00:03:29.626 --> 00:03:32.003 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI] No, silly. This
is where the muscle god

00:03:32.087 --> 00:03:35.006 position:50% align:center
Takemasukuru no Kami
is worshiped!

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:36.883 position:50% align:center
Any prayers you send
up regarding fitness

00:03:36.966 --> 00:03:38.134 position:50% align:center
can be answered here!

00:03:38.218 --> 00:03:40.762 position:50% align:center
You gotta love a god who
understands its niche.

00:03:40.845 --> 00:03:43.264 position:50% align:center
See! What did I tell ya?
It's perfect, right?

00:03:43.348 --> 00:03:45.100 position:50% align:center
In what way?

00:03:45.183 --> 00:03:47.602 position:50% align:center
Like, does it spark joy for you?

00:03:47.686 --> 00:03:49.020 position:50% align:center
Oh! I looked it up!

00:03:49.104 --> 00:03:51.690 position:50% align:center
It's also supposed
to be for romance!

00:03:51.773 --> 00:03:53.316 position:50% align:center
It says that even
if you're single,

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.610 position:50% align:center
you'll leave here and find
a partner right away!

00:03:55.694 --> 00:03:59.322 position:50% align:center
All right! Let's hike up
to that shrine!

00:03:59.406 --> 00:04:01.866 position:50% align:center
Man, it looks like even
more stairs from this angle.

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.743 position:50% align:center
Those gods want us
to work for it!

00:04:03.827 --> 00:04:07.330 position:50% align:center
Well, yeah. It makes sense
if you think about it.

00:04:07.414 --> 00:04:08.498 position:50% align:center
"God of exercise"?

00:04:08.581 --> 00:04:11.292 position:50% align:center
Climbing stairs is
a great workout!

00:04:12.335 --> 00:04:13.795 position:50% align:center
Hey, there!

00:04:13.878 --> 00:04:15.588 position:50% align:center
Today we're going to talk to
you all about stair climbing!

00:04:15.672 --> 00:04:17.382 position:50% align:center
Do you find yourself
constantly rushing toward

00:04:17.465 --> 00:04:19.551 position:50% align:center
the elevator or escalator?

00:04:19.634 --> 00:04:20.802 position:50% align:center
Well stop, now!

00:04:20.885 --> 00:04:23.054 position:50% align:center
Before you take the easy
way out, ask yourself,

00:04:23.138 --> 00:04:24.889 position:50% align:center
"am I working my legs today?"

00:04:24.973 --> 00:04:27.058 position:50% align:center
If you're not, and you've
got the time and energy,

00:04:27.142 --> 00:04:28.768 position:50% align:center
burn some calories
and use the stairs!

00:04:28.852 --> 00:04:30.603 position:50% align:center
And we're talkin'
some major calories!

00:04:30.687 --> 00:04:32.188 position:50% align:center
Here's how to calculate 'em.

00:04:32.272 --> 00:04:35.734 position:50% align:center
Climbing stairs burns about as
many calories as a light jog.

00:04:35.817 --> 00:04:39.487 position:50% align:center
But descending stairs can burn
about as many as riding a bike.

00:04:39.571 --> 00:04:42.657 position:50% align:center
If you climb about 400 steps,
that's basically the same as

00:04:42.741 --> 00:04:45.326 position:50% align:center
jogging for around
15 minutes.

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:47.454 position:50% align:center
So if jogging's not
really your jam,

00:04:47.537 --> 00:04:50.582 position:50% align:center
I'd recommend creating
a stair-climbing workout.

00:04:50.665 --> 00:04:53.335 position:50% align:center
Oh, but don't do the thing where
you use momentum to skip steps.

00:04:53.418 --> 00:04:55.754 position:50% align:center
That burns fewer calories.

00:04:55.837 --> 00:04:57.922 position:50% align:center
Keep your core tight
and your back straight.

00:04:58.006 --> 00:05:00.175 position:50% align:center
Take one step at a
time with confidence.

00:05:00.258 --> 00:05:01.885 position:50% align:center
If you try this
in a public area,

00:05:01.968 --> 00:05:03.970 position:50% align:center
keep your eye out
for creeps and weirdos.

00:05:04.054 --> 00:05:05.889 position:50% align:center
And make sure there's
plenty of light.

00:05:05.972 --> 00:05:07.974 position:50% align:center
A nearby staircase
could easily become

00:05:08.058 --> 00:05:10.352 position:50% align:center
your free, outdoor
workout studio.

00:05:10.435 --> 00:05:13.730 position:50% align:center
There's no excuse for you
not to get in shape!

00:05:13.813 --> 00:05:18.276 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI groaning]

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.652 position:50% align:center
What the crap?

00:05:19.736 --> 00:05:23.365 position:50% align:center
How many stairs do they
expect us to climb for this?

00:05:24.866 --> 00:05:28.328 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI] Ayaka's so fast.
Must be all that boxer training.

00:05:28.411 --> 00:05:30.789 position:50% align:center
It's her Roadwork
Running Routine.

00:05:30.872 --> 00:05:33.833 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
Uh! There's the shrine!

00:05:33.917 --> 00:05:38.213 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI grunting]
Made it. Finally!

00:05:38.296 --> 00:05:39.214 position:50% align:center
What?

00:05:39.297 --> 00:05:42.258 position:50% align:center
[MACHOMEN]
Rama! Lama! Ding-dong!

00:05:42.342 --> 00:05:44.427 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
I spy one dude with pants.

00:05:44.511 --> 00:05:45.637 position:50% align:center
When you can't come to the gym,

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:47.180 position:50% align:center
I guess the gym
will come to you.

00:05:47.263 --> 00:05:48.348 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI]
I have a feeling

00:05:48.431 --> 00:05:50.100 position:50% align:center
we're not getting up
there any time soon.

00:05:50.183 --> 00:05:53.103 position:50% align:center
[GINA] We could always camp
out in the herd of muscles.

00:05:53.186 --> 00:05:54.062 position:50% align:center
Oh, my pecs!

00:05:54.145 --> 00:05:54.979 position:50% align:center
Oh, my tris!

00:05:55.063 --> 00:05:56.064 position:50% align:center
There he is!

00:05:56.147 --> 00:05:58.108 position:50% align:center
The smell of fresh muscles!

00:05:58.191 --> 00:05:59.150 position:50% align:center
What now?

00:05:59.234 --> 00:06:01.361 position:50% align:center
[MACHOMEN chattering]

00:06:01.444 --> 00:06:03.029 position:50% align:center
Here comes the priest! Quiet!

00:06:03.113 --> 00:06:04.489 position:50% align:center
Where?

00:06:05.198 --> 00:06:07.450 position:50% align:center
[MACHOMAN 11K]
Such muscle!

All hail the muscle!

00:06:15.834 --> 00:06:18.211 position:50% align:center
Hi! Is this your
first time visiting?

00:06:18.294 --> 00:06:20.171 position:50% align:center
It's a shrine!
Put your pants on!

00:06:20.255 --> 00:06:22.340 position:50% align:center
You're gonna make
the shrine owners mad!

00:06:22.424 --> 00:06:24.342 position:50% align:center
This is not the time
or place for your undies!

00:06:24.426 --> 00:06:25.885 position:50% align:center
I think you've got
the wrong idea.

00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:27.971 position:50% align:center
This shrine belongs
to my family.

00:06:28.054 --> 00:06:30.390 position:50% align:center
I help them out around
New Year's. It's tradition.

00:06:30.473 --> 00:06:31.891 position:50% align:center
I don't believe you!

00:06:31.975 --> 00:06:33.893 position:50% align:center
[JASON] How did you not
know this about him?

00:06:33.977 --> 00:06:36.646 position:50% align:center
Uh? Freakin' Jason!

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:38.314 position:50% align:center
In the world of fitness,

00:06:38.398 --> 00:06:41.735 position:50% align:center
Mr. Machio is known as the
Great Muscle God we look up to.

00:06:41.818 --> 00:06:44.154 position:50% align:center
He's actually known as
the Muscle Priest as well.

00:06:44.237 --> 00:06:45.530 position:50% align:center
Isn't that cool?

00:06:45.613 --> 00:06:48.366 position:50% align:center
What's more, he's also
a licensed priest.

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:50.660 position:50% align:center
Bet it's kinda cool to be
part of the priesthood

00:06:50.744 --> 00:06:52.829 position:50% align:center
and slay the musclehood
at the same time.

00:06:52.912 --> 00:06:54.873 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI] That's not how this
sort of thing works, Jason!

00:06:54.956 --> 00:06:57.876 position:50% align:center
But thanks a heap for your
time and man-splainations!

00:06:57.959 --> 00:07:00.378 position:50% align:center
Do you really think our
prayers will be answered?

00:07:00.462 --> 00:07:02.797 position:50% align:center
I've decided I want to go all
in and wish for a boyfriend

00:07:02.881 --> 00:07:05.008 position:50% align:center
this year! I think
I'm finally ready!

00:07:05.091 --> 00:07:06.426 position:50% align:center
That's funny, me too.

00:07:06.509 --> 00:07:07.886 position:50% align:center
I had the same idea.

00:07:07.969 --> 00:07:09.179 position:50% align:center
I want one, too.

00:07:09.262 --> 00:07:11.139 position:50% align:center
[MACHIO]
Don't worry!

00:07:11.222 --> 00:07:13.099 position:50% align:center
If you wish with your heart,

00:07:13.183 --> 00:07:16.353 position:50% align:center
you'll receive
everything you want.

00:07:16.436 --> 00:07:18.438 position:50% align:center
We must go wishing
with our hearts!

00:07:18.521 --> 00:07:20.398 position:50% align:center
All our prayers
will be answered!

00:07:20.482 --> 00:07:22.025 position:50% align:center
If you want them to come true,

00:07:22.108 --> 00:07:24.444 position:50% align:center
wish from deep within
your pectoralis minor!

00:07:24.527 --> 00:07:26.279 position:50% align:center
Not everything has
to be about muscles!

00:07:26.363 --> 00:07:27.572 position:50% align:center
Boys?

00:07:27.655 --> 00:07:29.491 position:50% align:center
[MACHOMEN] Praise be to all
who are muscular!

00:07:29.574 --> 00:07:31.785 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI] Are you trying to be
as obnoxious as possible?

00:07:31.868 --> 00:07:33.870 position:50% align:center
[MACHOMEN]
Macho! Macho...

00:07:33.953 --> 00:07:36.081 position:50% align:center
[JASON] Hibiki and friends,
won't you join us in fellowship?

00:07:36.164 --> 00:07:37.999 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
Absolutely not!

00:07:40.251 --> 00:07:41.670 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS gasping]

00:07:41.753 --> 00:07:44.297 position:50% align:center
It's so beautiful!

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:53.515 position:50% align:center
<i>Vkusno</i> ! I love the First
Squid of the Year!

00:07:53.598 --> 00:07:55.850 position:50% align:center
It's called first Shrine of
the Year, not First Squid.

00:07:55.934 --> 00:07:56.976 position:50% align:center
But that's adorbs.

00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:58.353 position:50% align:center
The best part about Ikayaki

00:07:58.436 --> 00:08:00.855 position:50% align:center
is that it's rich in taurine
which helps reduce fat.

00:08:00.939 --> 00:08:05.110 position:50% align:center
The best part is that
it tastes good!

00:08:05.193 --> 00:08:07.821 position:50% align:center
You should only eat like
this in moderation Heebs.

00:08:07.904 --> 00:08:09.906 position:50% align:center
Do you want to whale-out
again during break?

00:08:09.989 --> 00:08:12.409 position:50% align:center
Uh. Ouch! Way harsh.

00:08:12.492 --> 00:08:13.827 position:50% align:center
Look, I'm not saying
you're wrong,

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:14.994 position:50% align:center
but what am I supposed to do

00:08:15.078 --> 00:08:16.913 position:50% align:center
when I can't get to
the gym to work out?

00:08:16.996 --> 00:08:19.749 position:50% align:center
That's right, I forgot
it's closed over break.

00:08:19.833 --> 00:08:22.168 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI] I'd say we should ask
Mr. Machio for an alternative,

00:08:22.252 --> 00:08:26.423 position:50% align:center
but he seems pretty busy with,
uh, all his shrine stuff.

00:08:26.506 --> 00:08:29.592 position:50% align:center
Just curious. What part
of this is a holy ritual?

00:08:29.676 --> 00:08:31.052 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI groans]

00:08:31.136 --> 00:08:33.471 position:50% align:center
Guess there's no point
in going jogging now.

00:08:33.555 --> 00:08:36.182 position:50% align:center
I mean, since we have a huge
tower of stairs we can climb.

00:08:36.266 --> 00:08:39.060 position:50% align:center
Crap, the pool is also
shut down for the holidays.

00:08:39.144 --> 00:08:41.312 position:50% align:center
I don't understand what
you're worried about.

00:08:41.396 --> 00:08:43.606 position:50% align:center
We don't need those
places to exercise.

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:46.192 position:50% align:center
In fact, I'm pretty sure
there's a park around here.

00:08:46.276 --> 00:08:48.069 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS]
A park?

00:08:48.153 --> 00:08:50.238 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI]
Did you say, "street workout"?

00:08:50.321 --> 00:08:53.575 position:50% align:center
<i>Da</i> ! It's all the rage in Europe
and the United States right now.

00:08:53.658 --> 00:08:55.910 position:50% align:center
It's also called a
freestyle workout.

00:08:55.994 --> 00:08:58.496 position:50% align:center
Basically, you just use whatever
equipment is available

00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:01.124 position:50% align:center
in the park to workout.
Dips, presses, chin-ups.

00:09:01.207 --> 00:09:03.877 position:50% align:center
It's simple and popular because
all you need is your own body.

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:06.129 position:50% align:center
[AYAKA] So it's basically
circuit training?

00:09:06.212 --> 00:09:07.797 position:50% align:center
Oh, yes and I miss it.

00:09:07.881 --> 00:09:10.258 position:50% align:center
I did it all the time
back in Russia.

00:09:10.342 --> 00:09:11.384 position:50% align:center
[AYAKA]
About that...

00:09:11.468 --> 00:09:12.761 position:50% align:center
Wh-What?

00:09:12.844 --> 00:09:15.013 position:50% align:center
It might be hard for
us to do that here.

00:09:15.096 --> 00:09:17.182 position:50% align:center
What's the problem?

00:09:19.351 --> 00:09:20.935 position:50% align:center
--[AKEMI laughs]
--[HIBIKI] Uh...

00:09:21.019 --> 00:09:23.730 position:50% align:center
Yeah, our parks are
different here.

00:09:25.273 --> 00:09:27.025 position:50% align:center
[BOYS laughing]

00:09:29.319 --> 00:09:30.487 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN 11A]
And then what?

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:31.529 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN 11B] I don't know,
that's all I saw.

00:09:31.613 --> 00:09:32.530 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN 11A]
That poor weasel.

00:09:32.614 --> 00:09:34.282 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN 11B]
Mm-hmm

00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:37.952 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI]
So, um. What do you think?

00:09:38.036 --> 00:09:40.955 position:50% align:center
This... This is an abomination.

00:09:41.039 --> 00:09:43.041 position:50% align:center
It's not a park,
it's an empty lot.

00:09:43.124 --> 00:09:45.043 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI] Why are you reacting
like it's the end times?

00:09:45.126 --> 00:09:46.836 position:50% align:center
Are you on world park patrol?

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:48.380 position:50% align:center
The thing is,

00:09:48.463 --> 00:09:50.840 position:50% align:center
Japan's parks have gradually
eliminated playground equipment.

00:09:50.924 --> 00:09:54.260 position:50% align:center
And more and more of them
don't allow exercising.

00:09:54.344 --> 00:09:56.638 position:50% align:center
[GINA]
This is awful. Why am I here?

00:09:56.721 --> 00:09:58.723 position:50% align:center
I had no idea the parks
in Japan were in

00:09:58.807 --> 00:10:01.601 position:50% align:center
such a sorry state of existence!

00:10:01.685 --> 00:10:03.269 position:50% align:center
[AYAKA] I mean, there's
a lone horizontal bar,

00:10:03.353 --> 00:10:04.813 position:50% align:center
so that's better than nothing.

00:10:04.896 --> 00:10:07.148 position:50% align:center
We can do some chin-ups
out here, at least.

00:10:07.232 --> 00:10:09.818 position:50% align:center
Well, I guess you guys can.
I can only do inclines.

00:10:09.901 --> 00:10:11.986 position:50% align:center
So we're gonna do chin-ups
and run around the park?

00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:13.863 position:50% align:center
That's not very balanced, is it?

00:10:13.947 --> 00:10:15.448 position:50% align:center
Oh! I have an idea!

00:10:15.532 --> 00:10:16.950 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI, AYAKA]
'Kay?

00:10:17.033 --> 00:10:18.493 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI] I forgot I brought this
just in case we needed it!

00:10:18.576 --> 00:10:20.745 position:50% align:center
This book has a lot
of great suggestions!

00:10:20.829 --> 00:10:23.456 position:50% align:center
[OTHERS] Why would you
bring that to a shrine?

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:27.419 position:50% align:center
<i>Exercises by body region.</i>
Designed by Toshio Ozu.

00:10:27.502 --> 00:10:29.337 position:50% align:center
[AYAKA] This kind of
reminds me of the last time

00:10:29.421 --> 00:10:31.423 position:50% align:center
we had to train without
equipment, amiright?

00:10:31.506 --> 00:10:33.967 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI] Months later,
we still don't have any.

00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:35.719 position:50% align:center
Uh! I found it!

00:10:35.802 --> 00:10:37.262 position:50% align:center
What?

00:10:37.345 --> 00:10:40.807 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI] No equipment needed.
It's all about training at home.

00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:43.476 position:50% align:center
[AYAKA] All those poses
are triggering me.

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:46.396 position:50% align:center
[OZU] In this chapter,
I will explain how to train

00:10:46.479 --> 00:10:48.189 position:50% align:center
without any equipment at all.

00:10:48.273 --> 00:10:50.567 position:50% align:center
Even if your environment
is lacking,

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:53.528 position:50% align:center
you can train so long as
you set your mind to it.

00:10:53.611 --> 00:10:56.031 position:50% align:center
The important thing
is not to give up!

00:10:56.114 --> 00:10:57.741 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI] I'll admit
that's some solid advice

00:10:57.824 --> 00:10:59.534 position:50% align:center
but what's with
the illustrations?

00:10:59.617 --> 00:11:01.870 position:50% align:center
Is he about to beat up
that girl, or what?

00:11:01.953 --> 00:11:03.913 position:50% align:center
[AYAKA] So it's basically
bodyweight training?

00:11:03.997 --> 00:11:07.917 position:50% align:center
Pushups, sit-ups,
back bends, and whatnots?

00:11:08.001 --> 00:11:09.961 position:50% align:center
[gasps] What is this?

00:11:10.045 --> 00:11:12.422 position:50% align:center
[AYAKA] A sealed Toshio Ozu
centerfold, obvi!

00:11:12.505 --> 00:11:13.882 position:50% align:center
[GINA]
I can't look! But I want to!

00:11:13.965 --> 00:11:16.134 position:50% align:center
But I can't! But I want to!

00:11:22.098 --> 00:11:24.309 position:50% align:center
Peek-a-boo! If you're
at home wondering,

00:11:24.392 --> 00:11:26.770 position:50% align:center
"how can I work out when I
don't have any equipment,"

00:11:26.853 --> 00:11:30.190 position:50% align:center
I've got an answer just for you!

00:11:30.273 --> 00:11:33.109 position:50% align:center
First! Let's try some
chest isometrics!

00:11:33.193 --> 00:11:35.445 position:50% align:center
Slap your hands together
in front of your chest

00:11:35.528 --> 00:11:38.156 position:50% align:center
and press hard using
70% of your strength!

00:11:38.239 --> 00:11:39.866 position:50% align:center
Hold it just like that
for seven seconds

00:11:39.949 --> 00:11:42.035 position:50% align:center
and don't you dare
stop breathing!

00:11:42.118 --> 00:11:44.662 position:50% align:center
Stop! Now let's do
some back isometrics!

00:11:44.746 --> 00:11:47.415 position:50% align:center
Weave your fingers together in a
little bird's nest and pull them

00:11:47.499 --> 00:11:50.126 position:50% align:center
in opposite directions!
You better be using 70%

00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:53.505 position:50% align:center
of your strength here, too,
and keep breathing!

00:11:53.588 --> 00:11:56.383 position:50% align:center
That's it! Let's move on to
the pike shoulder press!

00:11:56.466 --> 00:11:58.259 position:50% align:center
Get down to the ground
on all fours!

00:11:58.343 --> 00:12:00.553 position:50% align:center
Lift your bottom to the top!
Keep your legs razor straight!

00:12:00.637 --> 00:12:02.430 position:50% align:center
Bend your arms!
Just your arms!

00:12:02.514 --> 00:12:04.933 position:50% align:center
Bend them again! Yeah!

00:12:05.016 --> 00:12:08.019 position:50% align:center
Don't it make you feel like
doing bodyweight arm curls!

00:12:08.103 --> 00:12:09.771 position:50% align:center
Yeah! Relax your shoulders!

00:12:09.854 --> 00:12:11.690 position:50% align:center
Now, push down on the
wrist you're training

00:12:11.773 --> 00:12:13.024 position:50% align:center
with the opposite arm,

00:12:13.108 --> 00:12:15.735 position:50% align:center
and do those arm curls
like your mama taught ya!

00:12:15.819 --> 00:12:17.612 position:50% align:center
Wow! My mind is blown!

00:12:17.696 --> 00:12:20.365 position:50% align:center
There's so much more we can
do at home than just pushups!

00:12:20.448 --> 00:12:23.952 position:50% align:center
Right! You can now train anytime
and anywhere you want!

00:12:24.035 --> 00:12:25.870 position:50% align:center
Always stay aware
of your surroundings.

00:12:25.954 --> 00:12:28.373 position:50% align:center
Even though you're not
in a gym. Work hard!

00:12:28.456 --> 00:12:30.083 position:50% align:center
[OZU, JASON]
Yes.

00:12:31.042 --> 00:12:34.504 position:50% align:center
[GINA] I get it. So it's an
entire isometrics workout.

00:12:34.587 --> 00:12:36.756 position:50% align:center
You can easily adjust
the resistance for these.

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:38.299 position:50% align:center
So they're pretty safe.

00:12:38.383 --> 00:12:42.679 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI grunts] Bodyweight
shoulder presses are no joke!

00:12:42.762 --> 00:12:45.765 position:50% align:center
I can challenge myself
even without weights!

00:12:45.849 --> 00:12:48.351 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI] Bodyweight shoulder
curls are double effective.

00:12:48.435 --> 00:12:49.894 position:50% align:center
Be sure to apply
plenty of pressure

00:12:49.978 --> 00:12:51.479 position:50% align:center
with your triceps for these.

00:12:51.563 --> 00:12:54.649 position:50% align:center
You'll be working two body parts
at once without equipment.

00:12:54.733 --> 00:12:55.984 position:50% align:center
Combined with
chin-ups and running,

00:12:56.067 --> 00:12:57.485 position:50% align:center
that's a full body workout.

00:12:57.569 --> 00:12:59.404 position:50% align:center
And now the park
doesn't suck anymore.

00:12:59.487 --> 00:13:01.865 position:50% align:center
Still more of a street
workout than park day.

00:13:01.948 --> 00:13:02.741 position:50% align:center
True.

00:13:02.824 --> 00:13:05.410 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS laughing]

00:13:05.493 --> 00:13:06.286 position:50% align:center
What's up?

00:13:06.369 --> 00:13:08.204 position:50% align:center
[HOUSEWIVES whispering]

00:13:08.288 --> 00:13:09.748 position:50% align:center
[HOUSEWIFE 11D] This area's been
pretty shady lately.

00:13:09.831 --> 00:13:10.832 position:50% align:center
[AYAKA]
Looks like we're freakin'

00:13:10.915 --> 00:13:12.208 position:50% align:center
the neighbors out, guys.

00:13:12.292 --> 00:13:13.960 position:50% align:center
We should finish
this up and go.

00:13:14.044 --> 00:13:15.337 position:50% align:center
--[AKEMI] Yeah, okay.
--[HIBIKI] Ugh, fine.

00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:16.838 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] If you're pressing
your palms together

00:13:16.921 --> 00:13:19.507 position:50% align:center
and vibrating in a park,
they've got the right to stare.

00:13:19.591 --> 00:13:20.759 position:50% align:center
Just sayin'.

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:25.096 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
Ugh! What was that all about?

00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:28.308 position:50% align:center
I might have to call "meh' on
the whole park-training thing.

00:13:28.391 --> 00:13:30.769 position:50% align:center
We should try a different park
like the one closer to us.

00:13:30.852 --> 00:13:33.188 position:50% align:center
It's for athletes,
so we won't stand out.

00:13:33.271 --> 00:13:34.856 position:50% align:center
It gives us more options.

00:13:34.939 --> 00:13:37.525 position:50% align:center
And, look, we trained after
our New Year's all-nighter,

00:13:37.609 --> 00:13:39.694 position:50% align:center
now we've got a ton
of free time today!

00:13:39.778 --> 00:13:41.029 position:50% align:center
That's awesome!

00:13:41.112 --> 00:13:45.825 position:50% align:center
Aw man, I wish there was
something fun we could do.

00:13:45.909 --> 00:13:46.951 position:50% align:center
[GINA]
There is!

00:13:47.035 --> 00:13:49.412 position:50% align:center
Eh? I'm afraid to ask.

00:13:49.496 --> 00:13:53.792 position:50% align:center
[laughs] Don't be.
It's time for a do-over.

00:13:53.875 --> 00:13:55.543 position:50% align:center
Remember the other day?

00:13:55.627 --> 00:13:57.754 position:50% align:center
When we bombed
our idol audition?

00:13:57.837 --> 00:14:00.548 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI]
Oh, yeah. How could we forget?

00:14:00.632 --> 00:14:02.175 position:50% align:center
[GINA]
It was so humiliating!

00:14:02.258 --> 00:14:04.719 position:50% align:center
That memory haunts me
every single hour!

00:14:04.803 --> 00:14:06.554 position:50% align:center
And now, like a light
in the dark,

00:14:06.638 --> 00:14:09.599 position:50% align:center
we've been granted the
perfect chance for revenge!

00:14:09.683 --> 00:14:10.892 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI]
A hidden talent show?

00:14:10.975 --> 00:14:12.811 position:50% align:center
[AYAKA]
Televised live?!

00:14:15.146 --> 00:14:16.189 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:16.272 --> 00:14:17.649 position:50% align:center
Why do I have this feeling

00:14:17.732 --> 00:14:20.819 position:50% align:center
that the new year is already
off to a horrible start?

00:14:20.902 --> 00:14:24.030 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
Ah, because it is.

00:14:25.365 --> 00:14:26.866 position:50% align:center
[MAN 11A]
All right, we're back, crew!

00:14:26.950 --> 00:14:28.201 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
Look where we are!

00:14:28.284 --> 00:14:30.328 position:50% align:center
It's the live broadcast of
the New Year's Amateur

00:14:30.412 --> 00:14:31.705 position:50% align:center
Hidden Talent Show!

00:14:31.788 --> 00:14:35.125 position:50% align:center
Coming up next, our magical
contestant number 68!

00:14:35.208 --> 00:14:36.918 position:50% align:center
We've got Mystical Goro
in the house!

00:14:37.002 --> 00:14:38.628 position:50% align:center
Is it real or is it magic?

00:14:38.712 --> 00:14:40.338 position:50% align:center
[KUTARO]
Why do I do this?

00:14:40.422 --> 00:14:42.590 position:50% align:center
Just when I thought
I'd seen it all.

00:14:42.674 --> 00:14:44.843 position:50% align:center
[AUDIENCE]
Ohhh!

00:14:44.926 --> 00:14:47.887 position:50% align:center
[KUTARO] There's no end
to their mediocrity!

00:14:47.971 --> 00:14:50.140 position:50% align:center
We're doing an amateur talent
show for the New Year's

00:14:50.223 --> 00:14:53.059 position:50% align:center
broadcast? How tight
is our budget?

00:14:53.143 --> 00:14:56.604 position:50% align:center
Mihon TV's got a bikini
model swimsuit competition.

00:14:56.688 --> 00:15:00.483 position:50% align:center
MHK's doing a historical drama
with a star-studded cast.

00:15:00.567 --> 00:15:03.361 position:50% align:center
And we're putting on a benefit
to bury our ratings.

00:15:03.445 --> 00:15:05.530 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER 11A] Thank you for
that dazzling performance!

00:15:05.613 --> 00:15:09.743 position:50% align:center
[KUTARO] What is wrong with us?
Can't we catch a break?

00:15:09.826 --> 00:15:14.581 position:50% align:center
And now, please give a hand for
our group contestant number 69!

00:15:14.664 --> 00:15:18.209 position:50% align:center
These young ladies are
self-styled local idols.

00:15:18.293 --> 00:15:23.048 position:50% align:center
They're here representing
Koyo Women's Academy!

00:15:23.131 --> 00:15:28.136 position:50% align:center
No way! It's them!
The non-singing idols!

00:15:28.219 --> 00:15:30.388 position:50% align:center
I just noticed you're
wearing a school uniform?

00:15:30.472 --> 00:15:33.016 position:50% align:center
[TACHIBANA] Yeah.
I'm undercover as a student!

00:15:33.099 --> 00:15:35.935 position:50% align:center
So let's chat. You all go to
the same high school, right?

00:15:36.019 --> 00:15:39.147 position:50% align:center
What inspired you girls to enter
the competition tonight?

00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:40.732 position:50% align:center
Just something to do.

00:15:40.815 --> 00:15:43.401 position:50% align:center
We never tried something like
this, and it seemed like fun.

00:15:43.485 --> 00:15:45.487 position:50% align:center
And that sweet cash
prize is pretty dope!

00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:47.572 position:50% align:center
There are times when
sugar-coating is acceptable!

00:15:47.655 --> 00:15:48.698 position:50% align:center
This might be one of them!

00:15:48.782 --> 00:15:49.824 position:50% align:center
[KUTARO gasps]

00:15:49.908 --> 00:15:51.201 position:50% align:center
[KUTARO] No, wait!
What am I thinking?

00:15:51.284 --> 00:15:52.952 position:50% align:center
This might be my chance.

00:15:53.036 --> 00:15:56.581 position:50% align:center
The one thing they can do well
is make an impact.

00:15:56.664 --> 00:16:00.293 position:50% align:center
That's it! These kids are my
chance to turn this around!

00:16:00.377 --> 00:16:02.962 position:50% align:center
If they're as tragic and
dramatic as last time,

00:16:03.046 --> 00:16:06.132 position:50% align:center
we'll be able to go toe-to-toe
with the competition!

00:16:06.216 --> 00:16:08.176 position:50% align:center
All right, let's see
what else you got!

00:16:08.259 --> 00:16:09.594 position:50% align:center
Don't hold back!

00:16:09.678 --> 00:16:11.596 position:50% align:center
Awesome! Can you tell
me what hidden talent

00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:13.223 position:50% align:center
you girls will be
sharing with us?

00:16:13.306 --> 00:16:14.599 position:50% align:center
<i>Da</i> !

00:16:14.683 --> 00:16:16.643 position:50% align:center
We're here to break the air
chair world record live!

00:16:16.726 --> 00:16:17.977 position:50% align:center
That's boring as hell!

00:16:18.061 --> 00:16:20.146 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER 11A]
An air chair, huh?

00:16:22.607 --> 00:16:25.026 position:50% align:center
I see. That sounds thrilling,
but do you have

00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:26.945 position:50% align:center
anything else you
might want to share?

00:16:27.028 --> 00:16:29.197 position:50% align:center
Why? What's wrong
with air chairs?

00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:30.740 position:50% align:center
We wanted to break
a world record

00:16:30.824 --> 00:16:32.742 position:50% align:center
of over 11 hours and 5 minutes.

00:16:32.826 --> 00:16:34.744 position:50% align:center
And we're just gonna camp
out while you do that?

00:16:34.828 --> 00:16:36.746 position:50% align:center
Like this show isn't already
tedious enough?

00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:39.124 position:50% align:center
So they're making us
find something else to do?

00:16:39.207 --> 00:16:41.668 position:50% align:center
I can't come up with
anything good that fast.

00:16:41.751 --> 00:16:43.086 position:50% align:center
All right!

00:16:43.169 --> 00:16:44.963 position:50% align:center
We're gonna have to improvise
but we can make it work.

00:16:45.046 --> 00:16:47.590 position:50% align:center
Ms. Tachibana, wake up,
you and I are going first!

00:16:47.674 --> 00:16:49.551 position:50% align:center
[TACHIBANA gasps]
Me? Why? What'd I do? Whoa!

00:16:49.634 --> 00:16:52.554 position:50% align:center
Let's go! Ready? Let's start
with a wrestler's bridge!

00:16:52.637 --> 00:16:53.638 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah!

00:16:53.722 --> 00:16:55.932 position:50% align:center
[AUDIENCE cheers]

00:16:56.016 --> 00:16:57.434 position:50% align:center
[TACHIBANA]
Ayaka! I have no idea

00:16:57.517 --> 00:16:58.768 position:50% align:center
what it is you're
wanting me to do!

00:16:58.852 --> 00:17:00.895 position:50% align:center
[AYAKA] Just do what
we always do, duh!

00:17:00.979 --> 00:17:05.608 position:50% align:center
I hate my job. Better boring
than disastrous, I guess.

00:17:05.692 --> 00:17:07.068 position:50% align:center
Just a darn minute!

00:17:07.152 --> 00:17:08.903 position:50% align:center
What the hell's
a wrestler's bridge?

00:17:08.987 --> 00:17:11.823 position:50% align:center
I'm glad you asked. I've been
waiting to hit this pose.

00:17:11.906 --> 00:17:14.034 position:50% align:center
Who're you? Aren't you cold?

00:17:14.117 --> 00:17:16.703 position:50% align:center
The one thing that
wrestlers fear most is...

00:17:16.786 --> 00:17:19.414 position:50% align:center
...neck injury. Because
of that, they all do

00:17:19.497 --> 00:17:21.708 position:50% align:center
intense neck training
to protect it from harm.

00:17:21.791 --> 00:17:23.001 position:50% align:center
[KUTARO]
You're a neck trainer?

00:17:23.084 --> 00:17:25.420 position:50% align:center
No. But I support their work.

00:17:25.503 --> 00:17:28.006 position:50% align:center
The wrestler's bridge
is a neck exercise!

00:17:28.089 --> 00:17:29.591 position:50% align:center
Take a look at that girl!

00:17:29.674 --> 00:17:32.927 position:50% align:center
What? Okay?

00:17:33.011 --> 00:17:36.181 position:50% align:center
I'm already uncomfortable.
What's happening?

00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:42.729 position:50% align:center
[KUTARO]
Uh! Oh! Ouch!

00:17:42.812 --> 00:17:45.690 position:50% align:center
I see the bridge but she's
gonna break her neck!

00:17:45.774 --> 00:17:47.692 position:50% align:center
That, buddy, is a
wrestler's bridge,

00:17:47.776 --> 00:17:50.153 position:50% align:center
and she is exhibiting
perfect form.

00:17:50.236 --> 00:17:52.405 position:50% align:center
Her body creates
a beautiful arch.

00:17:52.489 --> 00:17:54.949 position:50% align:center
And this strengthens
her neck and her traps.

00:17:55.033 --> 00:17:57.911 position:50% align:center
She's gotta be careful not
to bend the neck too far.

00:17:57.994 --> 00:17:59.454 position:50% align:center
Once your body is used to it,

00:17:59.537 --> 00:18:02.290 position:50% align:center
you can bend the neck left and
right, or even move yourself

00:18:02.374 --> 00:18:04.292 position:50% align:center
back and forth applying
more resistance

00:18:04.376 --> 00:18:05.835 position:50% align:center
for those who are advanced.

00:18:05.919 --> 00:18:06.878 position:50% align:center
Whoa...

00:18:06.961 --> 00:18:08.505 position:50% align:center
Since it engages
your neck and traps,

00:18:08.588 --> 00:18:12.175 position:50% align:center
it helps to prevent stiffness in
these areas slowly but surely.

00:18:12.258 --> 00:18:14.010 position:50% align:center
If you're wanting to try
it for the first time

00:18:14.094 --> 00:18:15.845 position:50% align:center
you have to start very slowly.

00:18:15.929 --> 00:18:19.349 position:50% align:center
Don't hold the position for
too long. Take baby steps.

00:18:19.432 --> 00:18:21.685 position:50% align:center
[KUTARO] Thanks guy, I'll
remember that and use it

00:18:21.768 --> 00:18:23.687 position:50% align:center
the next time I'm standing
on my head.

00:18:23.770 --> 00:18:26.398 position:50% align:center
It makes no sense, but I'm
getting a strange feeling

00:18:26.481 --> 00:18:29.442 position:50% align:center
I've met this guy before.

00:18:29.526 --> 00:18:30.777 position:50% align:center
Ready for me?

00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:31.945 position:50% align:center
[TACHIBANA]
Oh, yeah!

00:18:32.028 --> 00:18:32.779 position:50% align:center
[AUDIENCE cheering]

00:18:32.862 --> 00:18:34.489 position:50% align:center
What? What'd I miss?

00:18:34.572 --> 00:18:35.740 position:50% align:center
Uh?!

00:18:37.117 --> 00:18:38.660 position:50% align:center
[TACHIBANA groaning]

00:18:38.743 --> 00:18:39.828 position:50% align:center
[KUTARO]
Holy effin' S,

00:18:39.911 --> 00:18:42.706 position:50% align:center
that girl's gonna snap
her neck in half!

00:18:42.789 --> 00:18:45.583 position:50% align:center
How the heck is she not
collapsing on herself?

00:18:45.667 --> 00:18:48.712 position:50% align:center
[MACHIO] Now that's a bridge.
Good job, Ms. Tachibana.

00:18:48.795 --> 00:18:50.755 position:50% align:center
[KUTARO]
Hey. Where'd he go?

00:18:50.839 --> 00:18:52.674 position:50% align:center
[MACHIO]
That's some fierce training.

00:18:52.757 --> 00:18:54.175 position:50% align:center
I'm impressed that
you're starting

00:18:54.259 --> 00:18:56.219 position:50% align:center
the new year out strong.

00:18:56.302 --> 00:18:58.471 position:50% align:center
[AUDIENCE cheers]

00:18:58.555 --> 00:19:00.390 position:50% align:center
[KUTARO]
Heh.

00:19:00.473 --> 00:19:04.519 position:50% align:center
Okay, I get it. They've
got some good stuff.

00:19:04.602 --> 00:19:10.275 position:50% align:center
I've been exposed to the
wrestler's bridge. But still...

00:19:12.277 --> 00:19:13.945 position:50% align:center
[KUTARO]
I'm so bored I could spit!

00:19:14.029 --> 00:19:15.989 position:50% align:center
That's just a girl
sitting on a bench!

00:19:16.072 --> 00:19:17.574 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] Quick reality check
for those who need it.

00:19:17.657 --> 00:19:19.617 position:50% align:center
Use extreme caution when
doing neck exercises

00:19:19.701 --> 00:19:21.161 position:50% align:center
if you aren't an
animated figure!

00:19:21.244 --> 00:19:24.205 position:50% align:center
If you have real bones and real
nerves, they can be injured.

00:19:24.289 --> 00:19:26.124 position:50% align:center
Be cool.

00:19:26.207 --> 00:19:27.375 position:50% align:center
Fast forward!

00:19:27.459 --> 00:19:30.295 position:50% align:center
Mr. Money Maker! Cha-ching!

00:19:30.378 --> 00:19:32.547 position:50% align:center
We had the second highest
ratings in a competitive

00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:35.133 position:50% align:center
time slot! All F1
viewers! [laughs]

00:19:35.216 --> 00:19:39.137 position:50% align:center
Our demographics show almost
100% retention, little buddy!

00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:42.265 position:50% align:center
[KUTARO] What is it that they
were finding so entertaining?

00:19:42.349 --> 00:19:44.976 position:50% align:center
The president said he's super
pleased with our results, too.

00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:48.271 position:50% align:center
Which means we need to feature
those girls again very soon.

00:19:48.355 --> 00:19:49.606 position:50% align:center
They're angels, I tell ya.

00:19:49.689 --> 00:19:51.316 position:50% align:center
They're at the top of
their game and we need to

00:19:51.399 --> 00:19:52.984 position:50% align:center
lock 'em down before
someone else does!

00:19:53.068 --> 00:19:55.028 position:50% align:center
Before they make
it big without us!

00:19:55.111 --> 00:19:56.696 position:50% align:center
[KUTARO] How am I supposed
to react to that?

00:19:56.780 --> 00:19:58.198 position:50% align:center
We're second?

00:19:58.281 --> 00:20:00.575 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
It was a tough one to beat.

00:20:00.658 --> 00:20:03.370 position:50% align:center
The highest rated moment
that night was a nippy-slip

00:20:03.453 --> 00:20:06.081 position:50% align:center
during the swimsuit competition.

00:20:06.164 --> 00:20:07.707 position:50% align:center
[KUTARO]
The president and that producer

00:20:07.791 --> 00:20:09.834 position:50% align:center
have seriously lost their minds.

00:20:09.918 --> 00:20:11.795 position:50% align:center
How am I supposed
to book them again?

00:20:11.878 --> 00:20:13.755 position:50% align:center
A new plan doesn't
develop overnight.

00:20:13.838 --> 00:20:16.257 position:50% align:center
[JASON] I believe I have
a solution for you,

00:20:16.341 --> 00:20:18.176 position:50% align:center
Mr. Deire Kutaro.

00:20:18.259 --> 00:20:20.428 position:50% align:center
[KUTARO]
What? Who's there?

00:20:20.512 --> 00:20:22.681 position:50% align:center
[JASON] Please forgive me
for disturbing you tonight.

00:20:22.764 --> 00:20:26.142 position:50% align:center
My name is Jason Sgatham,
I know the ladies you seek.

00:20:26.226 --> 00:20:27.811 position:50% align:center
That is to say we
are acquainted,

00:20:27.894 --> 00:20:31.356 position:50% align:center
or rather, I'm like
their guardian, at times.

00:20:31.439 --> 00:20:33.608 position:50% align:center
Yeah, sure.

00:20:33.692 --> 00:20:36.611 position:50% align:center
Actually, I have some good news
for you if you have a minute.

00:20:36.695 --> 00:20:39.114 position:50% align:center
Now check out this baby, huh?

00:20:39.197 --> 00:20:40.699 position:50% align:center
Ahh! What?

00:20:40.782 --> 00:20:42.367 position:50% align:center
This event exists?!

00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:44.911 position:50% align:center
[JASON] If Miss Hibiki and her
little friends become famous,

00:20:44.994 --> 00:20:48.790 position:50% align:center
it would greatly serve you,
me, and Sir Naruzo.

00:20:48.873 --> 00:20:52.127 position:50% align:center
Not to mention a few other
major players as well.

00:20:52.210 --> 00:20:56.506 position:50% align:center
So what do you say? Do you want
to work with us, Mr. Director?

[KUTARO]
This is crazy.

00:20:59.009 --> 00:21:00.510 position:50% align:center
It'll work!

00:21:00.593 --> 00:21:02.971 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] What exactly
is the Nikunoshima Tour?

00:21:03.054 --> 00:21:06.224 position:50% align:center
And what kind of adventures
await our lat-loving ladies?

00:21:06.307 --> 00:21:10.061 position:50% align:center
Find out on the next, and
final episode of this show!

00:22:40.318 --> 00:22:41.444 position:50% align:center
You knew it was comin'!

00:22:41.528 --> 00:22:43.154 position:50% align:center
We're all gonna
practice the bridge!

00:22:43.238 --> 00:22:45.532 position:50% align:center
Doing a full bridge right
away could lead to injury,

00:22:45.615 --> 00:22:47.534 position:50% align:center
so we're gonna try
an easier version

00:22:47.617 --> 00:22:48.827 position:50% align:center
that's still beneficial.

00:22:48.910 --> 00:22:51.079 position:50% align:center
Prepare to master
the glute bridge!

00:22:51.162 --> 00:22:52.997 position:50% align:center
Let's start with the basic form.

00:22:53.081 --> 00:22:55.041 position:50% align:center
Keep your shoulders
pinned to the floor.

00:22:55.125 --> 00:22:57.794 position:50% align:center
Knees stay bent as you lift
and lower your hips.

00:22:57.877 --> 00:22:59.254 position:50% align:center
When your hips are raised,

00:22:59.337 --> 00:23:01.172 position:50% align:center
there should be a straight
line from shoulder to knee.

00:23:01.256 --> 00:23:02.757 position:50% align:center
Hold that for a full second.

00:23:02.841 --> 00:23:05.969 position:50% align:center
Be sure to squish your knees and
thighs together the whole time.

00:23:06.052 --> 00:23:08.972 position:50% align:center
And your goal is ten reps!
All set?

00:23:09.055 --> 00:23:11.433 position:50% align:center
Ready? Let's go!

00:23:11.516 --> 00:23:13.393 position:50% align:center
[TACHIBANA]
Continue breathing regularly.

00:23:13.476 --> 00:23:15.937 position:50% align:center
Don't push yourself too hard.

00:23:16.021 --> 00:23:17.772 position:50% align:center
[AKEMI] Make sure you're not
putting too much pressure

00:23:17.856 --> 00:23:19.107 position:50% align:center
on your neck.

00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:21.067 position:50% align:center
[MACHIO]
...four...

00:23:21.151 --> 00:23:22.402 position:50% align:center
[AYAKA]
Feel that?

00:23:22.485 --> 00:23:25.947 position:50% align:center
Your glutes and abs
should be starting to burn.

00:23:26.031 --> 00:23:29.325 position:50% align:center
Keep going!
We're almost there, team!

00:23:29.409 --> 00:23:31.077 position:50% align:center
[MACHIO]
...here's eight!

00:23:31.161 --> 00:23:34.330 position:50% align:center
[HIBIKI] Just a one more!
Here's the last one!

00:23:34.414 --> 00:23:37.542 position:50% align:center
[MACHIO]
...ten! You did it!

00:23:37.625 --> 00:23:39.377 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS panting]

00:23:39.461 --> 00:23:40.712 position:50% align:center
No equipment needed!

00:23:40.795 --> 00:23:42.672 position:50% align:center
Lift your way to firmer
thighs and glutes.

00:23:42.756 --> 00:23:45.091 position:50% align:center
This is also a great move
to tighten the core.

00:23:45.175 --> 00:23:46.676 position:50% align:center
Shout it out and pose!

00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:48.762 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
True strength comes from within!
