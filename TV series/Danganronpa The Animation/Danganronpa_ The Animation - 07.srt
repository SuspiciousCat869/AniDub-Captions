00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:41,208
meaning Hagakure couldn't
have operated the cart

161
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:42,750
while wearing it.

162
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:44,291
[TOGAMI] I see...

163
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:46,666
So, Hagakure was indeed subdued
and stuffed into the outfit

164
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,750
as he maintains,
ergo not our culprit.

165
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:50,375
[HAGAKURE]
Naegi! Bro! Thanks!

166
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:52,375
--I owe you big time!
--Kid's a regular Sam Spade!

167
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:53,375
Hold on a sec...

168
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:55,166
What about the pic Celestia has

169
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:56,916
of Justice Robo
attacking Yamada?

170
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,500
[OHGAMI] Exactly.

171
00:07:58,583 --> 00:08:00,500
Hagakure couldn't very well have
accomplished that unconscious.

172
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:02,250
You both raise a fine point.

173
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:03,750
With photographic evidence,

174
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:05,625
he's still our only
plausible suspect.

175
00:08:05,708 --> 00:08:07,416
Wait! Don't shrug him off!

176
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,541
Yes, we're jumping
the proverbial gun here.

177
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:12,750
It behooves us to weigh all
possibilities carefully.

178
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:14,625
Too much is still in question.

179
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:16,000
[CELESTIA sighs]

180
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:18,333
If Hagakure's innocent,
we've but one other choice.

181
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:20,791
The only person
who lacks an alibi

182
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,041
for the time of the murders.

183
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:24,083
And I'm afraid
that's you, Kirigiri.

184
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:25,916
You must be the perpetrator.

185
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,250
[NAEGI gasps]

186
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:28,666
[KIRIGIRI] A fair assumption...

187
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:31,125
But ask yourself whether,
even with a flatbed cart,

188
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:33,791
a girl of my size would be
capable of moving Yamada.

189
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:36,458
Well, a gal the size
of an ogre would be!

190
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:38,416
Yeah, but the ogre
was on the second floor

191
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,000
at the time, wasn't she?

192
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:42,791
Only one person could
have managed it.

193
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:46,083
Consider the possibility that
Yamada simply moved himself.

194
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:47,666
[ALL gasp]

195
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:50,791
[KIRIGIRI] As in: he walked up
the stairs of his own volition.

196
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:52,333
[OHGAMI] But that
would mean he...

197
00:08:52,416 --> 00:08:54,000
would've been alive
the entire time!

198
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:55,250
[CELESTIA] No...

199
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:56,666
I'm afraid that doesn't
make a lick of sense.

200
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,958
[KIRIGIRI] What precisely
contradicts my theory?

201
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:01,750
The timing of the corpse
announcement, for one.

202
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:04,791
It was played at exactly
the moment Yamada's body

203
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:07,250
was found the first time
in the nurse's office.

204
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:09,875
[KIRIGIRI] Correct me if I'm
wrong, but weren't Yamada

205
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:12,166
and Ishimaru found within
moments of each other?

206
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:14,958
So Monokuma cut corners
by making an announcement

207
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:16,708
that covered both discoveries.

208
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:18,916
[MONOKUMA] I do not
cut corners, young lady.

209
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,958
One, count 'em, one
announcement per corpse,

210
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:23,416
according to protocol.

211
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,708
[CELESTIA] Fine...

212
00:09:24,791 --> 00:09:26,625
Discounting their obvious
change of position,

213
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:28,625
nothing on either body
indicated movement.

214
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:30,833
Nor is Yamada a
good enough actor

215
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:32,750
to have played possum
so convincingly.

216
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:34,208
You're leaving something out!

217
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:38,833
By all means, what
detail have I missed?

218
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:40,708
[NAEGI] When we first
found Yamada's body,

219
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:42,291
his glasses were
dripping with blood.

220
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:44,166
It's an image that's
stayed with me.

221
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,416
But when he turned up later
in the art supply room,

222
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,208
his glasses were clean.

223
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:50,708
He must've wiped them off
to see where he was going.

224
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:52,666
That's the only explanation.

225
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,958
[ASAHINA] Where'd the blood come
from in the first place, then?

226
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:57,291
It's simple.

227
00:09:57,375 --> 00:09:59,458
There's an emergency stash
in the nurse's office,

228
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:01,333
presumably for transfusions.

229
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:03,333
He'd have certainly had access.

230
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:06,333
Sounds like Tubby McFatass
got kinda overzealous

231
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:10,291
applying the Realism
Rouge. Ha! What a rube.

232
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:13,416
[CELESTIA] And no one saw him
while he was on the move?

233
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,083
[OHGAMI] Now that
I consider it...

234
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:16,916
While tracking down the bodies,

235
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,083
Asahina and I noticed the
art supply room was locked.

236
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:22,541
That door can only be
locked from the inside,

237
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:24,250
so somebody had to be in there.

238
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:27,166
All else being as you say,
it must have been Yamada.

239
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:29,375
He had probably
just moved Ishimaru.

240
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:30,833
That's so creepy.

241
00:10:30,916 --> 00:10:33,416
Indeed, and as it happens
I have hard evidence

242
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,166
to back up
Ohgami's assumption.

243
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:38,000
This scrap of paper was
found in Ishimaru's hand.

244
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:40,958
The rest however,
was stuffed into Yamada's...

245
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:42,500
...unmentionables.

246
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:44,875
--What were you doing in there?!
--You went trouser fishing?!

247
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:46,333
Yes, yes. Whatever.

248
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:48,625
Thankfully I didn't
have to dig very deep.

249
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:50,791
[HAGAKURE] Ah! That's
just like the one I got

250
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:52,500
telling me to go
to the game room!

251
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:55,250
Almost. But not quite.

252
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:57,416
Because this cryptic
note led Ishimaru

253
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,708
to an untimely demise.

254
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:01,166
Knowing it'd be used as
evidence against him,

255
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:03,541
Yamada hid it where he
assumed no one would find it.

256
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:05,208
[FUKAWA (SHO)]
In his tighty-whities!

257
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:06,958
Wait. The hammers, though.

258
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:10,125
If we go by the order,
Celestia and Yamada got konked,

259
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:13,125
then Yamada got killed,
followed by Ishimaru, right?

260
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:15,208
[NAEGI] I'm starting to think
the murderer numbered

261
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:17,125
the hammers to mislead us.

262
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:19,708
We now know Yamada
wasn't actually killed

263
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:21,500
until after Ishimaru.

264
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:24,791
So the numbers don't really have
anything to do with the order

265
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:26,083
in which they were used.

266
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:27,833
Sure! That makes sense.

267
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:30,250
All right. Then which
hammer had the honor

268
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:32,083
of dealing the fatal
blow to Yamada?

269
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:34,000
The one hanging on the wall.

270
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:36,000
It looked like somebody
had washed it.

271
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:38,083
I'm bettin' that's
our final weapon.

272
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:40,291
Call it "Justice Hammer Five."

273
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:43,750
Clearly, Yamada wasn't just an
unfortunate victim in all this.

274
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:45,541
He moved Ishimaru's body,

275
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:47,791
so at the very least
he was an accomplice.

276
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:50,208
But accomplices don't
graduate, do they?

277
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:51,625
No.

278
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:54,000
I think the real murderer
conned Yamada into helping

279
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:55,458
and then double-crossed him.

280
00:11:57,791 --> 00:12:00,041
[MONOKUMA] Okay!
Time's up, jurors!

281
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:03,458
Justice be damned, the
fat lady's in full voice!

282
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:06,291
Who's da doity double dealer
what persuaded our favorite

283
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:08,708
basement dweller to help
moidah the ex-hall monitor?

284
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:10,958
only to moicilessly
ice the blubber-butt

285
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:13,000
once he'd outlived
his usefulness?

286
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:21,000
[ASAHINA] Dang it,
this was so straightforward

287
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:23,833
when we came in here. How're we
supposed to figure it out now?

288
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:26,291
Yep. Sucks when you
got nothin' else to go on!

289
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:29,250
Come, now; the murderer
must've slipped up somewhere.

290
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:31,708
We're dealing with a
formidable strategist.

291
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:33,750
Something tells me
they dotted every "I."

292
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:35,666
Then maybe it's not Hagakure.

293
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:38,416
So let's not forget
she without an alibi.

294
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,750
So, what? Our gooses're cooked?

295
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:42,000
It's just game over
for all of us?

296
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:43,916
All but one of us,
if we're wrong.

297
00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:51,250
[NAEGI] I've gotta think...

298
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:53,416
There has to be something.

299
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,291
Go back...

300
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:55,708
Look at every detail...

301
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:57,291
Consider every angle...

302
00:12:57,375 --> 00:12:59,208
Remember.

303
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:00,958
[CELESTIA] We're going to die...

304
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:03,291
Picked off one-by-one
'til there's...

305
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:05,000
'til there's no one...

306
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:07,125
Exactly like they were.

307
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:09,458
Wait, Celestia.

308
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:11,708
You said something
in the nurse's office

309
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,958
earlier this afternoon
when we found Yamada's body.

310
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:16,583
Can you please repeat it?

311
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:18,166
Well, let me think...

312
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:19,666
What was it?

313
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:23,291
I believe something like "we'll
be picked off one-by-one?

314
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:26,250
Exactly like they were,"

00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:56,208
Best of luck.

474
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:58,708
Though I know it's
hollow coming from me.

475
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:07,375
[CELESTIA] Maybe dreams
aren't so merciless...

476
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:08,666
But no...

477
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:11,458
Now is a cruel time
for epiphanies.

478
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:19,625
Farewell, everyone. Heh.

479
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:22,000
In another life,
perhaps we'll meet again.

480
00:22:11,833 --> 00:22:14,541
[KIRIGIRI] She hid it
right under our noses.

481
00:22:21,458 --> 00:22:23,458
[NAEGI] I'm just glad it's okay.

482
00:22:23,541 --> 00:22:26,208
[KIRIGIRI]
That's one problem solved.

483
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:27,750
So, um...

484
00:22:27,833 --> 00:22:30,125
When you were off by yourself,
what were you investigating?

485
00:22:30,208 --> 00:22:32,541
[KIRIGIRI] I told you
not to worry about it.

486
00:22:32,625 --> 00:22:34,250
[NAEGI] Yeah, well,
for your information,

487
00:22:34,333 --> 00:22:36,125
I was worried about you!

488
00:22:36,208 --> 00:22:37,416
Like I was sayin'...

489
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,500
You practically vanished.

490
00:22:38,583 --> 00:22:40,083
[KIRIGIRI] I get it.

491
00:22:40,166 --> 00:22:43,625
It's okay. Frankly in your shoes
I'd think I was the mole, too.

492
00:22:43,708 --> 00:22:45,791
You're perfectly right
to be suspicious.

493
00:22:45,875 --> 00:22:46,458
[NAEGI] What?

494
00:22:46,541 --> 00:22:47,791
But I'm not! I...

495
00:22:47,875 --> 00:22:50,083
I'd follow you into battle
I trust you so much!

496
00:22:50,166 --> 00:22:51,750
[KIRIGIRI] Not a very
wise thing to say.

497
00:22:51,833 --> 00:22:52,875
[NAEGI] So what?!

498
00:22:52,958 --> 00:22:54,375
We're friends aren't we?

499
00:22:54,458 --> 00:22:55,541
I trust you...

500
00:22:55,625 --> 00:22:57,750
I'm just hoping you'll
return the favor.

501
00:22:58,833 --> 00:22:59,833
Trust, huh...?

502
00:22:59,916 --> 00:23:01,333
Very well, then.

503
00:23:01,416 --> 00:23:04,125
Perhaps it's not unwise to see
where this will lead us...

504
00:23:04,208 --> 00:23:07,000
Listen to me carefully.

505
00:23:07,083 --> 00:23:10,125
When off on my own,
I came across a room.

506
00:23:10,208 --> 00:23:13,291
Specifically the boy's restroom
on the second floor.

507
00:23:13,375 --> 00:23:14,125
No cameras.

508
00:23:14,208 --> 00:23:16,666
No monitors.

509
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:19,166
Look for the storage closet.

510
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:20,666
And check the back wall.

511
00:23:23,375 --> 00:23:24,750
Holy crap she was right.

512
00:23:35,208 --> 00:23:38,500
[NAEGI] "You must not
leave this place."

513
00:23:43,958 --> 00:23:46,500
[NAEGI groans]

514
00:23:53,041 --> 00:23:54,375
[NAEGI] What...?

515
00:23:54,458 --> 00:23:55,791
It can't be...

516
00:23:55,875 --> 00:23:57,750
Tell me I'm dreaming...

517
00:23:57,833 --> 00:23:59,208
It's all gone?!

518
00:24:02,083 --> 00:24:04,541
[blows landing]

519
00:24:04,625 --> 00:24:05,875
[NAEGI] Whatever's happening...

520
00:24:05,958 --> 00:24:07,416
Please...

521
00:24:08,791 --> 00:24:10,166
[NAEGI gasps]

522
00:24:13,625 --> 00:24:15,791
[NAEGI] What the hell?!

523
00:24:15,875 --> 00:24:17,291
What's going on?!
