00:00:16,458 --> 00:00:18,750
[NAEGI] This is the
elite private academy

2
00:00:18,833 --> 00:00:20,583
known as Hope's
Peak High School.

3
00:00:20,666 --> 00:00:22,875
And, yes, the name is ironic.

4
00:00:22,958 --> 00:00:25,166
More of a cruel joke, actually.

5
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:29,083
Because this is a
high school of despair.

6
00:00:29,166 --> 00:00:31,250
There's only one way
to graduate here.

7
00:00:31,333 --> 00:00:33,916
Kill one of your classmates,
without getting caught.

8
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:24,791
[MONOKUMA] Attention students!

9
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:26,333
Please be advised:

10
00:02:26,416 --> 00:02:29,166
As per the notices posted
on your respective doors,

11
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,416
while all dorm rooms

12
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,333
are equipped with
fully-functioning showers,

13
00:02:32,416 --> 00:02:34,250
the water will be
shut off at curfew.

14
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:35,708
No exceptions.

15
00:02:35,791 --> 00:02:37,791
So if I wanna take a shower
at night, I'm outta luck?

16
00:02:37,875 --> 00:02:40,958
[MONOKUMA] Additionally,
bear in mind only the showers

17
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:43,750
located in the girls' rooms
have locks installed.

18
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:45,125
Oh!

19
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:47,333
And you'll find I've left a
small token of welcome

20
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:49,000
for each and every one of you.

21
00:02:49,083 --> 00:02:53,250
I encourage you to let
your imaginations run wild!

22
00:02:58,791 --> 00:03:00,666
[NAEGI] Yeah, right.

23
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,791
I'd rather not if
it's all the same.

24
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:08,458
[NAEGI sighs]

25
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:10,583
[NAEGI] Might as well clean
up while there's time.

26
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:14,041
Really?

27
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:14,791
Ugh.

28
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:16,541
Son of a--! Aw c'mon!

29
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:18,500
I thought the guys'
showers didn't lock.

30
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:19,541
[MONOKUMA] Bingo!

31
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:22,125
Give that man a prize!

32
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:22,916
[NAEGI screams]

33
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,416
Where did you come from?!

34
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,125
[MONOKUMA] On the subject of
locks, some friendly advice:

35
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:29,791
I wouldn't leave my bedroom door
unsecured if I were you.

36
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:31,708
Why are you here?
What do you want?

37
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:34,250
[MONOKUMA] Ooh,
you're in a fix, Naegi!

38
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:37,000
Yeah, apologies for the
wonky doorknob there.

39
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:39,125
I'll put in a work-order
first chance I get.

40
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:40,500
Embarrassing, I know.

41
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:41,333
[NAEGI gasps]

42
00:03:41,416 --> 00:03:42,541
[MONOKUMA] Meantime,

43
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:44,250
the trick is to lift and
turn simultaneously.

44
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:47,083
Takes a li'l left-brain
right-brain coordination, but...

45
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:48,208
Oh, hey, there we go.

46
00:03:48,291 --> 00:03:50,083
[MONOKUMA laughs]

47
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:51,500
[MONOKUMA] Seriously, though...

48
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:53,541
What are the odds of you
gettin' the one bathroom door

49
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:54,708
that plays hard to get?

50
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:55,541
Hilarious!

51
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:57,166
[NAEGI] No big deal.

52
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,916
[MONOKUMA] But you're supposed
to lead a charmed life, right?

53
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,250
Frankly, kiddo,

54
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:04,041
Dame Fortune just doesn't
seem all that into you.

55
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:05,041
[NAEGI growls]

56
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:06,708
[MONOKUMA] Well,
that's it for me.

57
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:09,000
A thankless job,
but at the end of the day,

58
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:10,416
it's all about the kids.

59
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,041
And remember what I said:
lock this door.

60
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:14,500
Better safe than sorry!

61
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:19,708
[NAEGI sighs]

62
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:22,375
Yeah. Not that into me, huh?

63
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:26,083
Guess if she was I wouldn't've
wound up in this place.

64
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:26,833
[doorbell rings]

65
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:29,125
[NAEGI gasps]

66
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:29,916
[NAEGI] Yeah?

67
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,416
[MAIZONO] Um, hi...

68
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,666
It's me...

69
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,125
[NAEGI] Maizono?

70
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:38,458
Mind if I come in?

71
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:41,375
So, um..

72
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:42,666
It's getting kinda late.

73
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,666
Something happen?

74
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:47,000
I have a bad feeling
about my room...

75
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:48,250
[NAEGI gasps]

76
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:49,416
[MAIZONO] While I was
getting ready for bed,

77
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,083
my doorknob started to rattle.

78
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:53,041
Softly.

79
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:56,333
Somebody wanted in and they were
trying to be stealthy about it.

80
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:59,000
Well, it might've
been Monokuma.

81
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:00,833
When I flung the door open.

82
00:05:00,916 --> 00:05:02,875
There was no one in the hallway.

83
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:05,375
He must've moved quickly.

84
00:05:05,458 --> 00:05:07,375
Though it could've
been one of them.

85
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:08,833
The others...

86
00:05:08,916 --> 00:05:10,583
Look, we don't
have to go there.

87
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:13,666
I just... I'm just
kinda freaked out.

88
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,666
Hey, it's fine, don't worry.

89
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:18,458
We all agreed not to leave
our rooms after dark, right?

90
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:21,500
[MAIZONO] Yeah, but, it wasn't
a hard and fast rule.

91
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:24,125
Sure we all promised,
but what if someone lied?

92
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:26,541
Sorta paranoid,
but here's an idea.

93
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:28,333
You could stay in
my room tonight.

94
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:29,208
I mean, you know,

95
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:30,791
if you'll feel any safer.

96
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:32,208
[MAIZONO] Huh?

97
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:34,416
[NAEGI] The rules don't say who
has to be in which room,

98
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,000
only that it's smart
to be in one after curfew.

99
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:38,750
So, there you go. Loophole.

100
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:40,500
Problem solved.

101
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:42,041
But, you might--

102
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:45,791
W-Wouldn't it be kind of awkward
with us both in one bed?

103
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:46,875
Whoa!

104
00:05:46,958 --> 00:05:48,208
Th-That's not what
I meant! I, uh...

105
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:50,083
I mean, you said you
were freaked out, so,

106
00:05:50,166 --> 00:05:52,375
--I wanted to give you options.
--[MAIZONO] That's not it.

107
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:54,458
I know you didn't have
anything pervy on the brain.

108
00:05:54,541 --> 00:05:57,000
You're not that kind of guy.
I trust you, believe me.

109
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:59,041
I just wonder whether it
might be easier for us

110
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:00,625
to swap rooms for the night.

111
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:02,333
[NAEGI] Swap rooms?

112
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:03,791
Yeah, sure.

113
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:06,333
Like I said, all about
giving you options.

114
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:08,291
Whatever makes you feel safer.

115
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:09,833
But...

116
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:12,166
It doesn't weird you out to have
a guy sleeping in your bed?

117
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:13,375
[MAIZONO giggles]

118
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:14,500
Like I said,

119
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:16,458
I trust you. It'll be fine.

120
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:17,875
Well, okay...

121
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:20,041
We're good, then.

122
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:21,125
Just be warned,

123
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:23,125
my shower door has
a mind of its own.

124
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:24,416
I'm sure I'll
figure it out.

125
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:29,250
[school bells chime]

126
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:32,750
[MONOKUMA] Evenin' Rugrats!
Announcement time! At the tone

127
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:34,416
--the time was exactly 10pm.
--[NAEGI] Whatever you do,

128
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,500
don't open the door.

00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:36,833
--Promise me.
--[MAIZONO] You got it.

130
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:38,166
That door's staying locked
even if I know it's you

131
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:39,291
on the other side.

132
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:40,750
Would sorta defeat the purpose

133
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:42,458
of swapping rooms
otherwise, right?

134
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:45,000
[MONOKUMA] ...best hustle
your butt outta there!

135

Sweet dreams,
my little cherubs!

136
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:51,125
Flights of angels,
blah blah blah.

137
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:53,708
[NAEGI] Wow, so this
is Maizono's room.

138
00:06:53,791 --> 00:06:57,250
Seems like they're all
more or less identical.

139
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:59,333
[NAEGI sighs]

140
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:00,583
Don't be nervous.

141
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:02,125
Nothing to worry about.

142
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:10,875
Remember, you're only doing
this to keep Maizono safe.

Oh, that's right.

151
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:41,000
Maizono and I switched rooms
last night, didn't we?

152
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:43,083
[NAEGI] We all agreed to
eat breakfast together

153
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:44,333
every morning.

154
00:07:44,416 --> 00:07:46,625
Kinda like a roll call
to settle our nerves.

155
00:07:46,708 --> 00:07:48,333
[ASAHINA] Ah! Hey, Naegi!

156
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:50,583
[ISHIMARU] Hello. A
very fine morning to you.

157
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:51,958
[NAEGI] Hi, guys.

158
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:53,916
[NAEGI] The first ones
there, without fail,

159
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
were the ones you'd classify as
the rule-abiding "good kids."

160
00:07:58,083 --> 00:07:58,875
Ladies.

161
00:07:58,958 --> 00:08:00,083
[NAEGI] Followed by the crowd

162
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:01,833
whose sense of time
is a bit more flexible.

163
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:03,333
[ENOSHIMA] Sorry I'm late...

164
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:04,666
[NAEGI] Most kids our age fall
into the second category,

165
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:05,750
I think.

166
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:07,375
Excuse me for gawking.

167
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:08,625
What's the haps?

168
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:10,583
Well, you look so different.

169
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:12,125
In person, that is.

170
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:13,750
Forgive me.

171
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:15,125
[ENOSHIMA laughs]

172
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:17,541
Yeah, they sorta gussy me up
for the magazine shoots.

173
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:20,333
Heh. That's the magic
of touchin' up for you.

174
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:21,750
Hmm. You don't say.

175
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:24,291
Aww, c'mon, how different
can I really look?

176
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:26,375
You're gonna hurt my feelings.

177
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:29,583
[NAEGI] Last but not least are
the ones who come in pretty much

178
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:31,250
whenever they feel like it.

179
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:34,375
You might say they march--
if you can call it that--

180
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:36,333
to the beat of their own drum.

181
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:38,000
[HAGAKURE] Yeah see,
but that's the thing.

182
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:38,833
I didn't oversleep.

183
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:40,125
I got lost.

184
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:41,291
I'm tellin' ya.

185
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:44,000
This place is like
a freakin' labyrinth.

186
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:46,208
[ISHIMARU] This still
isn't everyone, though.

187
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:47,041
Hey, yeah.

188
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:49,625
Where're Togami and Maizono?

189
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,208
Well, okay, here's one of 'em.

190
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:55,458
[OHWADA] Dude, Maizono
behind you or what?

191
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:56,458
I'm starving.

192
00:08:56,541 --> 00:08:58,208
[TOGAMI] Do I look
like her keeper?

193
00:08:58,291 --> 00:09:01,166
I came here directly from
my room, thank you very much.

194
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:03,333
Little out of character
for her to be late,

195
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:04,916
she's usually here 'fore I am.

196
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,208
Uh-oh, think
maybe she's sick?

197
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:10,291
[HAGAKURE] Somethin'
wrong, brah?

198
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:11,416
'scuse me.

199
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,000
I should prob'ly
go check on her!

200
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,125
Maizono!

201
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:18,583
[NAEGI gasps]

202
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:19,708
What the heck?

203
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:21,375
It should be locked!

204
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:33,791
[NAEGI] Please tell me this
isn't what I think it is...

205
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:44,250
[NAEGI gasps]

206
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:57,125
[NAEGI screams]

207
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:08,625
[BOTH gasp]

208
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:09,750
What the...?

209
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:11,416
Where am I?

210
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,625
[FUJISAKI] The gym.

211
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:13,958
[ASAHINA] Sorry.

212
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:15,666
We carried you here after
we found you passed out.

213
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:18,875
Well, Ohgami did the
heavy lifting, actually.

214
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:21,250
So what I saw... was real?

215
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:21,958
[NAEGI gasps]

216
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:23,416
How's Maizono?!

217
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,250
I'm afraid
she's deceased.

218
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:28,500
Homicide.

219
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:34,833
[ISHIMARU] Where are you going?!

220
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:36,291
[NAEGI] Where do you
think I'm going?!

221
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:38,375
I can't just leave
her there, can I?!

222
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:39,958
Naegi! We need you

223
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:41,875
--to get a hold of yourse--
--Let go! I hafta--!

224
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:43,333
Waste of time,
my friend.

225
00:10:43,416 --> 00:10:46,000
I can assure you the girl
is well and truly departed.

226
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:47,791
[NAEGI] Then why are
we all standing around

227
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:49,583
with our thumbs up our butts?

228
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:50,833
Someone's been murdered!

229
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:53,375
We can't just treat this
like it's any other day!

230
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:56,583
Understand, Naegi, it isn't as
though we chose to stand around.

231
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:58,333
So then what the
hell's goin' on?

232
00:10:58,416 --> 00:11:00,250
Ugh. It was the damn bear.

233
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:03,208
The "principal." He ordered
us to meet in the gym.

234
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:04,541
Somethin' bout a "pep rally".

235
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:07,291
Believe me, man, we are
all against the idea.

236
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:10,166
"How on earth can you be so
disrespectful," we said.

237
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:11,666
But then--

238
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,458
[KIRIGIRI] Because they took
my suggestion and complied.

239
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:16,833
It's best if we just do
as the bear says for now.

240
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:18,583
[NAEGI] Kirigiri...

241
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:20,833
We're his prisoners,
plain and simple.

242
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:24,125
Nothing good can come of
us defying him on impulse.

243
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:27,666
Unless we want more causalities,
we have to play by his rules.

244
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:29,958
He killed her...

245
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:31,916
She was vulnerable
and he killed her...

246
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,541
I know it!

247
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:34,916
[MONOKUMA] BAAAH!

248
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,958
As if little ol' me would
do something like that!

249
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:40,166
Scouts honor! It wasn't me!

250
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:41,625
You monster!

251
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:44,166
[MONOKUMA] Use your head,
Mr. Jumps-To-Conclusions.

252
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:46,583
Why would I do something that
goes against the whole point

253
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:48,125
of this fine institution?

254
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,708
You're supposed to do
the killing, not me.

255
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:52,041
Rules are rules.

256
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:54,083
You shoulda seen me at
the zoo when folks ignored

257
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:56,083
the "do not feed
the bears" sign!

258
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:58,583
[FUJISAKI] But then,
who else? I mean, 'cause...

259
00:11:58,666 --> 00:12:00,000
[MONOKUMA] Like we don't know.

260
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:02,875
Wake up and smell
the formaldehyde!

261
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:05,416
The killer is one of you!

262
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,000
[ALL gasp]

263
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:09,416
[MONOKUMA] Ugh. Really?

264
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,666
THAT pulled the rug out
from under all of you?

265
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:14,333
I thought you were supposed
to be "gifted" students!

266
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:15,708
It's obvious!

267
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:18,416
One of you sent poor Maizono
to the sweet hereafter

268
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,125
so you could breathe
free air again.

269
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:21,291
And that's okay!

270
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,541
It's what you're s'posed to do!

271
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:24,583
[FUJISAKI] This is horrible.

272
00:12:24,666 --> 00:12:25,708
[ASAHINA] He's lying!

273
00:12:25,791 --> 00:12:27,583
Of course he's lying!

274
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:28,708
[MONOKUMA] Sorry, Charlie!

275
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:30,166
I'm tellin' the truth.

276
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,625
It was definitely one of you.

277
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:37,000
And right now, someone standing
here knows that all too well.

278
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:38,541
Is he telling the truth?

279
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:42,208
I demand whoever did it
come forward immediately!

280
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:44,291
Huh. Sure, that'll
work like a charm.

281
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:46,333
Do you ever listen to yourself? 

282
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:49,291
Look, whoever it is,
I won't judge.

283
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:51,375
I-It wasn't me, I swear!

284
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:54,041
Nuh-uh! I know you're
not lookin' at me!

285
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:55,916
Silence, all of you.

286
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,333
Right, then.

287
00:12:57,416 --> 00:13:00,083
Let us assume the perpetrator
is in fact one of us.

288
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:02,958
By your own rules, shouldn't
they have "graduated" by now?

289
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:06,291
[MONOKUMA laughs]

290
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:08,583
[MONOKUMA] Well aren't we a
Glass-Half-Full kind of guy?

291
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:10,333
I like your reckless optimism!

292
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:13,166
Having said that, though, the
main attraction's still to come.

293
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,250
What's that mean?

294
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:15,750
[MONOKUMA] Listen up, me droogs!

295
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:17,458
Freedom isn't straightforward;

296
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:20,791
there are a few
"supplemental" rules.

297
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:23,166
[CELESTIA] Ah, the article
in our digital notebooks

298
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:25,875
which states "Whoever kills
a classmate may graduate,

299
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:28,166
but he or she must not get
caught by the other students"?

300
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:31,208
[MONOKUMA] Exactamundo!
Someone studied!

301
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:33,250
Murder alone won't
cut the mustard;

302
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:35,708
the killer has to
get away with it.

303
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:39,125
In other words, to go free we
must commit the perfect crime.

304
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:41,791
[MONOKUMA] After each homicide,
you'll have time to investigate

305
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:44,041
before convening to debate
the guilt or innocence

306
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:45,291
of those who remain.

307
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:49,208
We call these debates--
Wait for it-- "Trials"!

308
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:51,625
You... can't be
serious about this.

309
00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:53,875
[MONOKUMA] The trial
format is loosely modeled

310
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,500
on parliamentary procedure;

311
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:58,375
fierce back and forth
being the order of the day.

312
00:13:58,458 --> 00:14:01,000
If the guilty party
is correctly identified,

313
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:04,250
they will be summarily punished,
and the rest of you allowed

314
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:07,000
to carry on under normal
school conditions.

315
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:10,583
Accuse someone wrongly, however,
and the defendant goes free

316
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:12,083
while the rest
of you are punished.

317
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:14,875
So point the finger
at your own peril!

318
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:15,750
There you have it!

319
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:17,583
High stakes trial by jury!

320
00:14:17,666 --> 00:14:18,875
Beautiful system, really.

321
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:19,750
Uh, sir...

322
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:20,791
These punishments...

323
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:22,250
What do they consist of?

324
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:24,541
[MONOKUMA] Ah, I suppose
another name for them

325
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:26,166
would be "executions."

326
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:29,666
But surely you...
You don't mean that?

327
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:30,708
[MONOKUMA] Oh-ho!

328
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:32,833
I mean exactly that, sweetheart!

329
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:35,166
We're talkin' electrocution.

330
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,083
Gas chamber.

331
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:41,250
Death by hurricane, which,
yes, we CAN make happen.

332
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:44,375
[ALL gasp]

333
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:46,791
Wait. I want to be
sure I understand.

334
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:49,500
Decide incorrectly
and the jury gets killed?

335
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:51,916
[MONOKUMA] Let no one say
you aren't the smartest chimp

336
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,458
in the tree.

337
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:55,708
Oh, and way to imply you're
not the culprit in this case,

338
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:57,833
by the by. Well done.

339
00:14:57,916 --> 00:14:59,375
[ISHIMARU growls]

340
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:02,583
[MONOKUMA] You all get to play
judge, jury and executioner

341
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:06,250
quite possibly of yourselves,
so proceed with caution!

342
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:07,666
Nuh-uh.

343
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,958
You're a nut-job and I refuse
to be part of this crap!

344
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:11,041
[MONOKUMA] Beg pardon?

345
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:12,708
You heard me,
you psycho hair ball.

346
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:15,375
Far as I'm concerned, the
whole trial thing can get bent!

347
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:16,208
[MONOKUMA] Aw, but why?

348
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:17,750
Is that even a question?!

349
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:20,333
I'm not playing juror if it
means risking my damn life

350
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:21,208
and that's that!

351
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:22,708
[MONOKUMA] Oh, be reasonable!

352
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:25,041
Don't even try to talk to me
about being reasonable,

353
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:26,125
you sadistic freakazoid.

354
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:27,708
I'm out of the game.

355
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:29,083
[MONOKUMA] Ooh-hoo-hoo!

356
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:31,708
The presence of evil before me
is so overpowering,

357
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:32,958
whatever shall I do?

358
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:34,166
I shan't succumb!

359
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:35,458
Perish the thought!

360
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:37,791
No, ma'am. I'm
stronger than that!

361
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:40,875
When Monokuma fights,
he fights to the last breath.

362
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:42,583
I will not be defeated!

363
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:46,416
I'll nip this budding rebellion
and reign victorious over--

364
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,416
I'm sorry.

365
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,500
You were tryin'
to say something?

366
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:49,916
[MONOKUMA] Big mistake...

367
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,250
Huh?

368
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:52,791
[MONOKUMA] Man-handling
the principal in any way,

369
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:54,791
shape or form is
strictly forbidden.

370
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:56,250
The rules, remember?

371
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:58,875
I know I warned you
about breakin' 'em.

Okay...

376
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:09,750
Not gonna lie, kinda weird...

377
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:11,791
It's, uh, I dunno really...

378
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,000

[gasping, screaming]

380
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:23,291
[FUJISAKI] Oh no... Oh no!

381
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:25,166
That is seriously
messed up.

382
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,916
[MONOKUMA] Honestly, I'd wanted
to avoid messy situations

383
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,875
like that as much
as humanly possible.

384
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:32,416
But, when an example's
begging to be made,

385
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,625
you can't let a
bad attitude slide.

386
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:36,875
Let's hope the gravity
of your situation

387
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:38,875
is beginning
to sink in.

388
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:41,000
High stakes are high.

389
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:45,583
[MONOKUMA] Best of luck
playing junior detectives!

390
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:47,750
The trial will be
gettin' under way soon,

391
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:51,625
so put on those thinkin' caps
and start a-case crackin'!

392
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:55,000
This is insanity...

393
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:56,375
What do we do?

394
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:58,125
If that was an example...

395
00:16:58,208 --> 00:17:00,375
[TOGAMI] At the very least
we can rule out Enoshima

396
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:02,541
as a suspect in Maizono's death.

397
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:05,500
I propose that we move forward
with the investigation.

398
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:08,333
Not to sound unduly harsh,
but mourning for lives lost

399
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:11,333
can only hamper chances
of saving our own.

400
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:12,750
Sorry, but that is harsh.

401
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:15,166
The girl was warned;
not least of all by me.

402
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:17,541
Those who cannot adapt
are quickly swept away

403
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:19,833
on the tide of their
own obsolescence.

404
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:21,458
In short, good riddance.

405
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,958
That is a terrible
thing to say!

406
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:25,875
Our personal feelings
on the matter

407
00:17:25,958 --> 00:17:27,291
are neither here nor there.

408
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:29,250
The situation we've
been tasked with

409
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:32,291
is to unmask the culprit or die.

410
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:34,166
Aw, crap. Heads up, guys!

411
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:35,916

[YAMADA] Whoa.

415
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:45,583
It gives a complete run-down
of Maizono's cause-of-death.

416
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:47,625
Ah, this could prove useful.

417
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:50,916
Apparently the room she was
found in wasn't her own.

418
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,333
But, quite tellingly,
it was Naegi's.

You greased the
poor girl, didn't ya?

422

Hold on just a minute.

It's not what it looks like!

00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:01,875
I think you'd better explain.

[NAEGI] She came to me wanting
to switch rooms for the night

426
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:07,291
and I said okay. She was
scared; she needed my help.

Oh, sure. We'll
believe that line.

Oh, come on.

[TOGAMI] Naegi, put yourself in
our shoes, what would you think?

432
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:20,583
I'm sorry, but if
you're innocent,

433
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:23,083
the burden of proof is on you.

434
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:25,500
--Guys, listen--
--Everyone. Come.

435

00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:29,416
Pray that it goes well.

438
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,583
It's as good a place
to start as any.

[NAEGI] I'm not a murderer.

441
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:38,750
But only two people
besides me know that.

442
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:41,875
One of 'em is the killer,
and the other one's dead.

443
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:44,500
I gotta do something
before it's too late!

"Victim is one Sayaka Maizono.

Time of death,
approximately 1:30am.

in the dormitory wing,

from a large
butcher's knife.

[NAEGI] I agreed to

was the toast of her generation!

her chart-topping girl

phenomenally successful

476
00:20:53,958 --> 00:20:56,083
vocal group disband?

477
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:03,666
Oh no. He is a monster.

478
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,166
Is there nothing he won't do

479
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:07,958
to make sure we play
his psychotic game?

480
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:11,833
How far is his reach that he can
bring down a chart-topping band?

481
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:16,125
[school bells chimes]

482
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:17,291
[MONOKUMA] All right, kiddos.

483
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:19,166
Your principal's bored
out of his gourd,

484
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:21,708
so whadaya say we get
this show on the road?

485
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:26,166
Time for the highly
anticipated trial phase!

486
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:28,375
Kindly march your butts
over to the red door

487
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:30,083
located on the first
floor at the end of the

488
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:32,708
academics wing and
mosey on through.

489
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:43,916
[ISHIMARU] Nice one. Don't
you know how to tell time?

490
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,041
We've been waiting,
I'll have you know.

491
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:48,458
Hah. I suppose you
can hardly blame him.

492
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:50,000
Right?

493
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:51,833
He knows it's only a matter
of time before he's executed.

494
00:21:51,916 --> 00:21:53,625
We haven't proved
anything yet.

495
00:21:53,708 --> 00:21:55,708
I'll remind you the
man's owed a fair trial.

496
00:21:55,791 --> 00:21:56,708
Whatever, man.

497
00:21:56,791 --> 00:21:59,416
Look at him,
he's totally guilty.

498
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,333
[NAEGI] I don't stand a chance.

499
00:22:01,416 --> 00:22:03,791
They all think I did it.

500
00:22:03,875 --> 00:22:06,791
Maizono's the only one
who'd know I'm innocent.

501
00:22:06,875 --> 00:22:09,125
She and whoever
actually killed her.

502
00:22:09,208 --> 00:22:10,500
[MONOKUMA laughs]

503
00:22:10,583 --> 00:22:12,375
[MONOKUMA] Is everybody in?

504
00:22:12,458 --> 00:22:15,958
Hop aboard and be conveyed,
as if by magic,

505
00:22:16,041 --> 00:22:17,791
to the student courtroom.

506
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:20,750
Otherwise known as the
Moment of Truth Room,

507
00:22:20,833 --> 00:22:21,875
for all of you.

508
00:22:21,958 --> 00:22:23,083
[NAEGI whimpers]

509
00:22:23,166 --> 00:22:25,041
[KIRIGIRI] Nervous?

510
00:22:25,125 --> 00:22:27,000
You have two options here:

511
00:22:27,083 --> 00:22:29,625
Bring Maizono's killer to light.

512
00:22:29,708 --> 00:22:32,958
Or, collectively, suffer
the fate rightfully theirs.

513
00:22:33,041 --> 00:22:34,958
The choice is up to you.

514
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:38,458
[NAEGI] And so, as they say,

515
00:22:38,541 --> 00:22:42,458
the curtain rises on a life
and death performance.

516
00:22:42,541 --> 00:22:45,291
Do we outwit one of
our own, or do we die?

517
00:22:45,375 --> 00:22:47,583
Do we risk it all to
save our own skins,

518
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:49,250
or drag the whole group down?

519
00:22:49,333 --> 00:22:52,416
Do we trust each other,
or do we destroy each other?

520
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,666
Our lives are on the line.

521
00:23:00,791 --> 00:23:02,958
[NAEGI] Time for
the first Class Trial!
