Attention student body.

00:00:19,541 --> 00:00:22,250
"School Life of Mutual
Killing" is now entering

00:00:22,333 --> 00:00:25,833
what we'll call the "True
Answer Arc." No holds barred.

4
00:00:25,916 --> 00:00:27,208
All or nothin'.

00:00:27,291 --> 00:00:29,708
Now, so you don't piss
and moan about fairness,

6
00:00:29,791 --> 00:00:33,291
I'm granting you unprecedented
access to all rooms on campus!

Go hog wild!

8
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,875
[MONOKUMA] Time's a-wastin',
so have yourselves a look-see.

Unlock the mysteries at
the heart of Hope's Peak.

[NAEGI] Wow.

11
00:00:50,708 --> 00:00:52,541
A monsoon blow through here?

12
00:00:52,625 --> 00:00:53,583
I mean, damn...

13
00:00:53,666 --> 00:00:55,041
Look at this place.

14
00:00:57,375 --> 00:00:58,833
[MONOKUMA] No loitering, now.

15
00:00:58,916 --> 00:01:02,000
The last trial's just
around the corner.

16
00:01:02,083 --> 00:01:05,000
[MONOKUMA laughs]

17
00:01:13,916 --> 00:01:15,000
[NAEGI] Here we go...

18
00:01:15,083 --> 00:01:16,958
Might as well head in.

19
00:01:20,458 --> 00:01:22,583
[NAEGI] So you actually think
this is where your old man

20
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:23,791
hung his hat?

21
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:25,250
Yes.

22
00:01:26,416 --> 00:01:27,875
Oh. That's right.

23
00:01:27,958 --> 00:01:31,583
You already cracked this puppy
open with the skeleton key.

24
00:01:31,666 --> 00:01:33,166
[KIRIGIRI] And,
I'm sorry to say,

25
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:35,041
already came up empty-handed.

26
00:01:35,125 --> 00:01:39,416
Every last file on the hard
drive led me down a blind alley.

27
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,500
Not a scrap about
the "incident."

28
00:01:41,583 --> 00:01:43,791
[NAEGI] Figures the bear'd
give us access to a room

29
00:01:43,875 --> 00:01:45,125
where there's diddly squat.

30
00:01:45,208 --> 00:01:47,916
[KIRIGIRI] Well, there is
one small ray of hope.

31
00:01:49,833 --> 00:01:51,583
[NAEGI] Ah-ha.

32
00:01:51,666 --> 00:01:53,333
It's clearly
shielding something,

33
00:01:53,416 --> 00:01:55,166
but your guess is
as good as mine.

34
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:56,875
Wish I was a hacker.

35
00:01:56,958 --> 00:01:59,500
I've tried all the obvious
choices, but no luck...

36
00:01:59,583 --> 00:02:01,500
Unfortunately we don't
have the time to plug in

37
00:02:01,583 --> 00:02:03,041
every single possibility.

38
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:06,750
Hey... D'you think that...

39
00:02:06,833 --> 00:02:09,125
I mean, you don't mind
if I have a go at it?

40
00:02:21,791 --> 00:02:23,500
Didn't see that comin'...

41
00:02:28,125 --> 00:02:29,625
Check out the party box.

42
00:02:29,708 --> 00:02:31,958
I don't believe I'd be
so quick to open it...

43
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:35,041
Whatever's in there, you can
be certain it's not a party.

44
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:39,541
Huh?!

45
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:41,000
[NAEGI screams]

46
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:44,833
Naegi, meet my dad.

47
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:46,291
I'm so sorry!

48
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:49,500
Wait, back up a sec!

49
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:52,000
How could you possibly
know that's your dad?!

50
00:02:52,083 --> 00:02:53,958
Look at the information
we've been given,

51
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:55,083
I mean really look at it...

52
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:56,958
That's the only
conceivable answer.

53
00:02:57,041 --> 00:02:58,458
[ALTER EGO] Oh yeah,
one more thing...

54
00:02:58,541 --> 00:03:01,250
I've learned that he's a man
in his late thirties, and...

55
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:04,958
the odds of him still being
on-campus are rather high.

56
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:07,291
[MONOKUMA] To get you
sniffing in the right direction,

57
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:09,000
here's a pointed li'l puzzler:

58
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:11,750
Why was the number of
students inducted alive

59
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:14,416
into this facility
capped at sixteen?

60
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,791
Is there some
special significance

61
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:18,250
tied to that figure?

62
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:20,583
[KIRIGIRI] Inducted alive...

63
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:22,541
He used that word
because evidently

64
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:23,750
there were people already here

65
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:26,125
for whom that wasn't
a fair description.

66
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:27,708
I don't know what it amounts to,

67
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:31,625
but I think by the time we got
here my father was long dead.

68
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:33,791
We're down the rabbit hole.

69
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:35,666
And you were right
this entire time...

70
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,416
Whoever the
mastermind really is,

71
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,250
it sure as hell can't
be an old skeleton.

72
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:41,000
Glad we're
in agreement.

73
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:43,583
[NAEGI] Where are you going?

74
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:45,583
We can't leave him like this...

75
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:47,250
Ugh...

[digital notebook chimes]

77
00:03:57,291 --> 00:03:59,833
[NAEGI] Um, jackpot maybe?

78
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:02,708
Something tells me this'll
be useful down the road.

79
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:04,291
[KIRIGIRI] Truth be told...

80
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:06,208
I'd just as soon it wasn't.

come to this school

to solve some deep,
dark mystery...

83
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,833
I came to reconnect
with my dad...

84
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:18,666
That's what I get for
having dreams, I suppose.

85
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,958
Whatever.
Good riddance.

00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:34,000
and apparently it
can open any of them.

322
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:36,000
There was a journal
inside one...

323
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:39,791
It talked about converting this
place into some kind of shelter.

324
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:41,125
Yeah, okay...

325
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:42,958
So who'd the journal belong to?

326
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:44,208
Good question...

327
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:46,750
Kiri, does this look
familiar to you at all?

328
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:49,666
[KIRIGIRI] That is most
definitely my handwriting.

329
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:50,750
[HAGAKURE] Say what?!

330
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:53,458
But you have no
memory of writing it.

331
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:54,541
[KIRIGI gasps]

332
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:55,875
We were right...

333
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:57,333
Explain it to them.

334
00:14:58,541 --> 00:15:01,666
I know it's not a
very pleasant thought.

335
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:04,708
In fact, it's downright
terrifying...

336
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:06,875
But we have to
face the facts...

337
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:08,833
These pictures are real.

338
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:10,291
We've got...

339
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:17,500
[NAEGI] Amnesia!

340
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,083
And whether we
like it or not,

341
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:20,916
the pictures are
proof positive!

342
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,708
Well, that's a
whip and a half...

343
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:24,500
Does kinda make sense, though...

344
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:27,166
Except it's the craziest
bad sci-fi explanation

345
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:28,958
anyone's ever tried to
jumble my brains with!

346
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:30,416
Yeah... I mean, c'mon...

347
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,791
What's that called?
"Arkham's Razor?"

348
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:33,625
Look...

349
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:34,916
If they were the only thing

350
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,500
pointing in that
direction, fine...

351
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:39,500
But we stumbled
onto something else.

352
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:42,166
A video file of
everyone talking...

353
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:43,875
to the principal.

354
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:45,416
[FUKAWA] To who?!

355
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,041
[NAEGI] Yeah, I hardly believed
it myself at first, but...

356
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:49,333
We're being interviewed...

357
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:50,500
One on one...

358
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:52,125
About this school.

359
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:54,458
What do we say
specifically?

360
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:57,208
We're agreeing to spend the rest
of our lives in this place...

361
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:59,916
The principal lays
it out and we consent.

362
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,250
[gasping]

363
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:02,541
[TOGAMI] Interesting...

364
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:05,708
Do we seem hesitant,
or under duress?

365
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:07,083
[NAEGI] Not even a little.

366
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:08,083
[gasping]

367
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:09,250
[FUKAWA] That's complete crap!

368
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:11,750
Why on earth would
we agree to this?!

369
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:13,916
I wish I had an answer...

370
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:14,916
Sorry...

371
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,333
I have no idea...

372
00:16:16,416 --> 00:16:17,750
But I can tell you this:

373
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:19,583
The video is legit.

374
00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:22,416
So, you assume the pictures
and video are connected.

375
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,583
[NAEGI] Yeah.

376
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:26,208
[HAGAKURE] Ugh!
This is completely insane!

377
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:27,750
Well, insane or not...

378
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:30,750
The truth is what it is--
Denial is useless...

379
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:31,958
Isn't it?

380
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:33,541
[MONOKUMA] Pos-o-lutely!

381
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:35,125
And the boy's nailed it.

382
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:36,041
Huh?!

383
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:37,625
[gasping]

384
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:39,125
[MONOKUMA] Another name
for this place

385
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:41,166
could be the Amnesiacs Ward!

386
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,458
[MONOKUMA laughs]

387
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:46,000
But it's not typical amnesia.

388
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:47,458
Oh no.

389
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:49,958
Our memories were
stolen from us!

390
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:51,125
[MONOKUMA] Sheesh.

391
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:53,083
Now you're just splitting hairs.

392
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:54,541
But... how does...

393
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:56,541
How does that even work?
I mean...

394
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:57,875
stealing them?

395
00:16:57,958 --> 00:16:59,041
[MONOKUMA] Immaterial...

396
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:01,000
The details make
zero difference.

397
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:03,541
I could probably just
make somethin' up!

398
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:07,250
Would you believe, mesmerism
(fancy word for hypnotism)?

399
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:08,666
Or maybe a li'l
bit of the ol'

400
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:12,208
chop-chop, scramble-scramble
Penfield style?

401
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:14,416
Point is, that ain't the point.

402
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,708
You're side-stepping
the real issue.

403
00:17:17,791 --> 00:17:19,791
You know, for once I'm
inclined to believe you;

404
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:22,166
the how isn't one tenth
as crucial as the what...

405
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,708
Which memories were removed?

406
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:25,291
[MONOKUMA laughs]

407
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:28,125
[MONOKUMA] 'Eyyy, now that's how
you get to the bottom of things!

408
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:30,958
But let's not forget the
other purpose of this trial.

409
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:33,208
You little nuggets are
here to solve the murder

410
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:36,333
of one Mukuro Ikusaba, too.

411
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:39,416
Her killer and the mastermind
happen to be the same person...

412
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,708
I'm sure of it...

413
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:42,125
Kiri and I know who.

414
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:43,750
[gasping]

415
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:45,000
[MONOKUMA] Do you now?

416
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:46,583
Ha!

417
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:50,958
Well by all means, don't keep
us poor wretches in suspense!

418
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:52,541
[KIRIGIRI] You're on
record as having said

419
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:55,250
the number of students enrolled
at Hope's Peak High School

420
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:56,958
was capped at sixteen.

421
00:17:57,041 --> 00:17:58,666
Is that true?

422
00:17:58,750 --> 00:17:59,666
[MONOKUMA] Oh, yes.

423
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,625
A bear never lies!

424
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:03,083
But that...

425
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:05,333
That would mean one of us
has to be Ikusaba's killer!

426
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:06,041
Really?

427
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:07,500
'Cause I don't think so.

428
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:08,833
Huh...?

429
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:11,000
[MONOKUMA] Huh? Interesting.

430
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:12,958
But I thought you found ten--

431
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:15,333
count 'em, ten corpsicles
in the morgue...

432
00:18:15,416 --> 00:18:19,083
So y'know, wouldn't that tend
to narrow the list of suspects

433
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:20,666
down to just you six?

434
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,291
Not necessarily!

435
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:27,791
[MONOKUMA] No?
Lay it on me, Poirot!

436
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:30,375
[NAEGI] I only found
nine bodies in the morgue.

437
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:31,416
But...

438
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,291
ten people have been killed...

439
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:35,666
So why don't the numbers jive?

440
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,041
[ASAHINA] Uuuuh...

441
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:39,416
[NAEGI] There were ten
bodies in cold storage, yes,

442
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,083
but one of them was recycled...

443
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:43,958
That's the body we found
in the botanical garden.

444
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:46,375
Okay, that's all
kinds of sick...

445
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:47,833
Whose was it?!

446
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:50,166
I'll tell ya this,
whosever it was...

447
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:51,541
they'd been butchered.

448
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:54,750
A lot like Enoshima,
as a matter of fact.

449
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:58,041
[FUKAWA] Not a
lot like; exactly like!

450
00:18:58,125 --> 00:19:01,791
So, no one in this room
has to be a murderer.

451
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:03,750
Ah, that's brilliant...

452
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:04,666
So, uh...

453
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:05,625
what you mean...

454
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:06,625
is that...

455
00:19:06,708 --> 00:19:08,833
Ikusaba's alive
and the murderer?

456
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:10,583
No.

457
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:12,000
What?

458
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:14,208
The real killer...

459
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:18,250
Was my attempted attacker,
from the other night...

460
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:19,958
The mastermind.

461
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:21,250
[MONOKUMA laughs]

462
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:22,916
[MONOKUMA] I can't
fault your reasoning,

463
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,750
but it doesn't do ya
a whole lotta good

464
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:26,583
without a positive ID...

465
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:30,000
The masked marauder
was just that: masked.

466
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:31,125
If you're gonna insist
that none of you

467
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:33,083
in this room is the culprit,

468
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:36,708
then that only leaves
Mukuro Ikusaba.

469
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:38,208
That's where you're wrong!

470
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:42,958
[MONOKUMA] How in
blazes am I wrong?!

471
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:45,333
My attacker may have
been wearing a mask,

472
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:48,333
but their right hand
was clearly visible.

473
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:50,125
You know what
wasn't on that hand?

474
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:51,416
A tattoo.

475
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,333
[TOGAMI] The mark of Fenrir!

476
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:55,041
There you have it...

477
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:57,083
Not Ikusaba.

478
00:19:57,166 --> 00:19:58,458
[MONOKUMA] Hmmm...

479
00:19:58,541 --> 00:20:00,083
Wait just a minute...

480
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:02,916
There's a contradiction
there, Naegi, old bean!

481
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,333
You can't have your
cake and eat it, too.

482
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:09,000
If it's not Ikusaba,
then it has to be one of you!

483
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:13,375
When you think about it, I'd say
the evidence points to Kirigiri.

484
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:15,833
Otherwise, why the gloves?

485
00:20:15,916 --> 00:20:18,208
♪ Suspicious. ♪

486
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:20,041
No way! You're
pullin' our leg!

487
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:21,375
It was you the whole time?

488
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:22,875
No, say it's not true!

489
00:20:22,958 --> 00:20:26,500
[MONOKUMA] Now'd be a good
time to defend yourself.

490
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:27,833
Yes, I agree...

491
00:20:27,916 --> 00:20:28,583
All right...

492
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:30,541
Let me show you my hand.

493
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:33,250
As good a proof of my
innocence as I possess.

494
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:36,750
What happened to you?

495
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:39,125
I was burned, badly...

496
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:41,708
Not so very long ago, in fact...

497
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:45,166
Call it a hard life-lesson for
a burgeoning girl detective...

498
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:46,875
Wow, that...

499
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:49,041
That took a lot more
balls than I have...

500
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,666
[KIRIGIRI] If it brings
the mastermind to justice

501
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:56,666
I'm more than able
to manage, thank you.

502
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:59,666
Are you satisfied with
regard to me and tattoos?

503
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:01,250
[MONOKUMA] Well, poop...

504
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:04,791
First you accuse me, then you
subject me to hamburger hands?

505
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:07,041
This is startin' to hurt
my feelings, guys!

506
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:09,125
Like, really burn me up!

507
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:11,166
Ooop! Sorry...

508
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:12,916
Slip of the tongue there...

509
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,666
No offense, eh, hon?

510
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:15,708
None taken.

511
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:17,916
Feel free to say
whatever you please.

512
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,541
Kirigiri isn't
the murderer.

513
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:23,333
She didn't kill anyone,
nor is she the mastermind.

514
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:25,750
I'm afraid that honor goes
to Monokuma's puppet master

515
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:28,833
who feigned her own death
and took to the shadows.

516
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:30,666
Junko Enoshima!

517
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,416
[ALL] What?!

518
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,291
[MONOKUMA] Hello,
wild conjecture!

519
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:36,166
Fly by the seat
of your pants much?

520
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:37,958
You don't have a
shred of evidence!

521
00:21:38,041 --> 00:21:40,375
You're not squirming
your way out of this one!

522
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:43,041
Oh, yeah. I've taken score.

523
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:44,541
[MONOKUMA] Hmm...?

524
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:46,875
[NAEGI] You've tried to hide
Enoshima's true identity

525
00:21:46,958 --> 00:21:49,125
from us twice now,
Monokuma.

526
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:51,750
[MONOKUMA] What?!
You are makin' this up!

527
00:21:51,833 --> 00:21:53,833
[NAEGI] No, I don't think so...

528
00:21:53,916 --> 00:21:55,375
Deny it all you want...

529
00:21:55,458 --> 00:21:57,750
But there was definitely intent.

530
00:21:57,833 --> 00:22:01,000
'Cause if we saw her face,
the jig'd be up!

531
00:22:01,083 --> 00:22:03,000
[MONOKUMA] What jig, precisely?

532
00:22:03,083 --> 00:22:05,083
The girl in the video
and the pictures

533
00:22:05,166 --> 00:22:08,250
is not the Enoshima we met
when we first came here!

534
00:22:09,958 --> 00:22:13,083
[MONOKUMA] Ow!
What is wrong with you?

535
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:15,833
Who else do you think
it could have been?

536
00:22:15,916 --> 00:22:17,958
I believe we both
know the answer to that.

537
00:22:18,041 --> 00:22:19,750
The only choice left:

538
00:22:19,833 --> 00:22:21,250
They switched places...

539
00:22:21,333 --> 00:22:22,541
That Enoshima...

540
00:22:22,625 --> 00:22:24,250
was Mukuro Ikusaba!

541
00:22:26,125 --> 00:22:27,625
[MONOKUMA] Damn, double ow!

542
00:22:27,708 --> 00:22:29,708
We weren't in a position
to know the difference

543
00:22:29,791 --> 00:22:31,208
not with our memories wiped.

544
00:22:31,291 --> 00:22:33,375
An imposter
would've had it made.

545
00:22:33,458 --> 00:22:36,375
[NAEGI] By killing Ikusaba,
who'd taken your place...

546
00:22:36,458 --> 00:22:39,583
You had free reign
over everything.

547
00:22:39,666 --> 00:22:42,875
Junko Enoshima's alive,
and listening right now!

548
00:22:44,333 --> 00:22:45,708
[MONOKUMA] Son of a biscuit!

549
00:22:45,791 --> 00:22:48,083
"The School Life of
Mutual Killing?!"

550
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:49,458
This whole thing was her!

551
00:22:49,541 --> 00:22:50,541
That's right...

552
00:22:50,625 --> 00:22:52,958
Junko Enoshima,
you are the mastermind!

553
00:22:55,083 --> 00:22:57,458
[MONOKUMA] Mother trucker!

554
00:23:00,291 --> 00:23:01,250
[TOGAMI] Bravo...

555
00:23:01,333 --> 00:23:03,500
Playing dead is
your strong suit.

556
00:23:03,583 --> 00:23:04,833
[KIRIGIRI] Give up...

557
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:06,708
It's all over now...

558
00:23:06,791 --> 00:23:09,250
Admit defeat.

559
00:23:09,333 --> 00:23:11,291
[MONOKUMA] Admit defeat?

560
00:23:11,375 --> 00:23:12,750
Oh, ho-ho...

561
00:23:12,833 --> 00:23:14,208
I think not.

562
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,625
[ALL gasp]

563
00:23:21,708 --> 00:23:23,250
[ENOSHIMA] At long last...

564
00:23:23,333 --> 00:23:26,000
Oh, the oceans of
time I've crossed!

565
00:23:26,083 --> 00:23:29,958
I'd nearly tired of waiting for
minds of your caliber to come.

566
00:23:31,041 --> 00:23:32,791
[ALL gasp]

567
00:23:32,875 --> 00:23:33,958
Yes...

568
00:23:34,041 --> 00:23:36,000
A fairly common plot twist...

569
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:37,041
But...

570
00:23:37,125 --> 00:23:40,125
For what it's worth,
I'm mortified...

571
00:23:40,208 --> 00:23:44,750
Mukuro and I were two sides of
the same coin, you might say.

572
00:23:44,833 --> 00:23:46,208
[NAEGI] That's it...

573
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:48,666
The Two Despairs!

574
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:51,791
[ENOSHIMA] Fraternal twins,
invariably at odds...

575
00:23:51,875 --> 00:23:54,541
One rough-hewn,
military minded...

576
00:23:54,625 --> 00:23:55,875
The other, cunning.

577
00:23:55,958 --> 00:23:58,875
Cunning and compulsively
attractive...

578
00:23:58,958 --> 00:24:00,000
So!

579
00:24:00,083 --> 00:24:02,125
Guess which one I was!

580
00:24:06,666 --> 00:24:16,625
[ENOSHIMA cackles]

581
00:24:16,708 --> 00:24:24,458
[ENOSHIMA cackles]
