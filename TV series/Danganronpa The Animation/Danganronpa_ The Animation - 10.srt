1
00:00:18,541 --> 00:00:20,041
[NAEGI] Another trial...

2
00:00:20,125 --> 00:00:24,291
Another area of the
school open to us.

3
00:00:24,375 --> 00:00:26,958
Another circuit on
the merry-go-round.

4
00:00:27,041 --> 00:00:29,416
Wash, rinse, repeat...

5
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:32,000
None of us coulda
cared less by then...

6
00:00:32,083 --> 00:00:35,250
but there was the
fifth floor, waiting.

7
00:02:11,291 --> 00:02:12,250
[TOGAMI] Right.

8
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:14,250
All present and accounted for.

9
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:16,000
Your reports then, please.

10
00:02:16,083 --> 00:02:19,375
Well, Asahina and I checked
out the Botanic Garden.

11
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:22,458
[HAGAKURE] There was
a flower the size

12
00:02:22,541 --> 00:02:24,125
of a freakin' beach umbrella,

13
00:02:24,208 --> 00:02:26,166
but, no sign of a way out.

14
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,000
[ASAHINA] Also, no idea why,

15
00:02:28,083 --> 00:02:29,708
but they have a
chicken coop up there.

16
00:02:29,791 --> 00:02:31,500
Five chickens total.

17
00:02:31,583 --> 00:02:33,333
Other than that,
the only thing stood out

18
00:02:33,416 --> 00:02:35,000
was a storage shed
full of tools.

19
00:02:35,083 --> 00:02:35,958
[HAGAKURE] So...

20
00:02:36,041 --> 00:02:37,458
You guys have any luck?

21
00:02:37,541 --> 00:02:39,750
I noted no
stairwells leading up.

22
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:41,041
From which I conclude

23
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:43,333
this building boasts
only five stories.

24
00:02:43,416 --> 00:02:44,500
Oh, yes...

25
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:46,916
And a classroom that
piqued my interest.

26
00:02:48,583 --> 00:02:51,125
[TOGAMI] Bloodspattered
and reeking of grease,...

27
00:02:51,208 --> 00:02:54,041
it appears a lot
of people died there.

28
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:55,916
Seriously?!

29
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,083
Whaddya think happened?!

30
00:02:58,166 --> 00:03:00,333
[TOGAMI] I'd think that
would be patently obvious.

31
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:03,333
If the horrific incident
Alter Ego alluded to was real,

32
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:06,041
that room's a candidate
for where it took place.

33
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:07,416
[gasping]

34
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,625
[KIRIGIRI] The matter begs
further investigation.

35
00:03:09,708 --> 00:03:11,875
I'll look into it myself.

36
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:12,750
Of course...

37
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:14,500
Why do you insist on going solo

38
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:16,625
whenever our situation
is at its most grim?

39
00:03:16,708 --> 00:03:18,208
It's a pattern with you...

40
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:19,583
Things go akimbo,

41
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:21,875
and like that, off you scamper.

42
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,291
[TOGAMI] Anything
you'd like to share

43
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:25,458
with the rest of the class?

44
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:26,875
Such as?

45
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:28,875
Oh, I don't know, perhaps...

46
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:31,791
you could start out by telling
us all who you really are.

47
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:35,250
[TOGAMI] Take your time.

48
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:36,708
[KIRIGIRI] I'm sorry.

49
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:38,791
I fear I don't remember.

50
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:40,041
Oh, sure! I bet...

51
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:41,583
How convenient!

52
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:43,708
Do you think we
were born yesterday?!

53
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:45,291
Point made, Fukawa.

54
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:48,083
And for the love of onions
control your halitosis.

55
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:49,375
[FUKAWA gasps]

56
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:51,250
So, it's to be amnesia then?

57
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:53,791
Rather a tired device,
don't you think?

58
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:57,625
Surely you've a better
cover story than that?

59
00:03:57,708 --> 00:03:59,500
I knew you wouldn't
believe me...

60
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:02,083
Nevertheless, it is the truth.

61
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:04,250
[TOGAMI] You realize by
sticking to that line,

62
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:07,791
you leave me no choice; certain
liberties are now forfeit.

63
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:10,666
Your room key...

64
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,250
I demand you relinquish it.

65
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:13,416
--What?!
--What?!

66
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,958
Don'cha think
you're overreacting?

67
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:16,791
She has the option to talk.

68
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:17,875
Calm down...

69
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:19,125
There's no reason
to get all uppity.

70
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:20,666
[KIRIGIRI] Fine.

71
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,583
Good. We're all ears.

72
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:28,458
[TOGAMI] Damn it...

73
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:29,958
Very well...

74
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:33,041
Why you chose secrecy I cannot
surmise, but c'est la vie.

75
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:34,291
But... I mean...

76
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:35,916
If she actually has amnesia,

77
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,958
it's so not fair for us
to treat her like this.

78
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:39,125
You got a point.

79
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:41,041
Guess she could be
tellin' it like it is.

80
00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:43,250
Every other nightmare
happens in this hellhole,

81
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:45,333
why not a li'l tabula rasa?

82
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:46,250
Hmph.

83
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:48,500
Very interesting
turn of phrase.

84
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:51,250
If you're of the opinion this
school breeds only nightmares,

85
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:53,000
far be it for me
to disuade you.

86
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:54,541
[NAEGI gasps]

87
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:56,625
[KIRIGIRI] Are you satisfied
I've been adequately reined in?

88
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:58,166
I have other business
to attend to.

89
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:59,125
Kiri wait!

90
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:00,916
Let the stubborn fool go.

91
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:04,625
[FUKAWA mumbles]

92
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:05,958
Wonderful...

93
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:07,791
I presume you're eager
to offer up some comment?

94
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:09,208
[FUKAWA mumbles excitedly]

95
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:12,166
Then I suppose you'd best
subject us to your vapors.

96
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,583
[FUKAWA guffaws]

97
00:05:13,666 --> 00:05:16,500
You're so tolerant
of me, sweet Togami...

98
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:18,083
Breath's good now...

99
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:20,833
I think I spewed most of
the crud into my hand, so--

100
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:21,666
[TOGAMI] Your point?!

101
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,125
We haven't all day!

102
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:24,625
Right you are!

103
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:25,625
In, um...

104
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:27,375
a classroom on
the fifth floor...

105
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:29,750
something caught my attention...

106
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:32,583
That's a survival knife!

107
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,166
Aw, hell no!

108
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:37,125
The psychopathic serial killer
does not get to hang on to that!

109
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:39,000
I'll take it off your hands!

110
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:40,916
[TOGAMI] Not so fast.

111
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,416
After Ohgami, both
of you have a history

112
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,291
of bringing harm to others.

113
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:46,958
[ASAHINA] That does make sense.

114
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:48,041
As it stands...

115
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:50,500
Naegi's the only one
of us eligible.

116
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:51,916
Eh?! For what?!

117
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,166
To keep it...

118
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:56,291
In all other hands
the knife is a liability.

119
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:58,541
Just what I need...

120
00:05:58,625 --> 00:05:59,916
Yes, very nice.

121
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
[FUKAWA] Ah! Sorry!

122
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:02,583
I really have no
idea what I ate!

123
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:04,625
Maybe I should find a mint?!

124
00:06:04,708 --> 00:06:06,458
I wasn't trying to be glib.

125
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:08,500
I meant handing over the knife.

126
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:10,458
Wait, what did I do?

127
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:11,208
But...

128
00:06:11,291 --> 00:06:12,666
That was a compliment?

129
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,166
Oh, master...

130
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:16,333
I must be dreaming...

131
00:06:16,416 --> 00:06:18,375
[FUKAWA giggles]

132
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:19,458
Damn...

133
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:20,791
There's so much
wrong with that girl,

134
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:22,083
I don't even know
where to start.

135
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:23,833
[television pops on]

136
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:25,916
[MONOKUMA] Yo... Turd buckets...

137
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,583
Gym! Now!

I am one...

[MONOKUMA growling,
blows landing]

142
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:40,000
[ASAHINA] Uh-oh...

143
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:41,625
He's really on the warpath.

144

[MONOKUMA] You're damn
right I am, Miss Thang!

145
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:45,875
How'm I s'posed to feel

146
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:48,208
when there's a thieving
thief in our midst?!

147
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:49,791
Thief?

148
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:51,458
[MONOKUMA] Don't
play dumb with me!

149
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:55,166
One of you stole my treasure--

150
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:58,666
And to think I've been treatin'
you like honored guests...!

151
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:01,708
What kind of a
world do we live in?!

152
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:02,875
'Kay, so, um...

153
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:05,166
What kinda treasure
is missing exactly?

00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,875
[MONOKUMA] As if you don't know!

155
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:09,416
You even took out a
surveillance camera!

156
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,750
Blatant violation of
school rules right there!

157
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:13,875
Huh...?

158
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:15,166
Hold on...

159
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:16,625
You're one short!

160
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:17,958
Ah-ha!

161
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:20,541
Amnesia Girl's
the one, I knew it!

162
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:22,500
No! You know what?

163
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:24,250
You're all responsible!

164
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:26,416
Well good luck using
me as reference

when you're out there
poundin' the pavement!

166
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:30,750
[HAGAKURE] What...
the hell was that?!

167
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:33,666
A rather bold move,
stealing from the principal.

168
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,375
Typical of Kirigiri.

169
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,291
[NAEGI] Why, though?

170
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:41,416
What's she trying to accomplish?

171
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:45,791
[NAEGI] And who is she? Really?

172
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:48,291
[doorbell rings]

173
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,416
Is something up?

174
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,500
Men's dressing room,
second floor...

175
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:54,958
Meet me in five.

176
00:07:58,333 --> 00:07:59,625
[KIRIGIRI]
Sorry for the trouble.

177
00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:01,625
I know it's late...

178
00:08:01,708 --> 00:08:03,291
But you and I need to talk

179
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:06,208
and I dare not do it in view
of the surveillance cameras.

180
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:08,958
[NAEGI] Whoa.

181
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:09,916
Oh, man...

182
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,125
that's why Monokuma's so pissed?

183
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:14,541
[KIRIGIRI] It did
come from his office.

184
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:15,791
[NAEGI] Wait, what?!

185
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:18,291
That place is sealed up
tighter'n Togami's butt!

186
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:20,083
How did you get this?!

187
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,833
[KIRIGIRI] Through Ohgami...

188
00:08:21,916 --> 00:08:23,708
She unlocked the door.

189
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:26,958
[KIRIGIRI] Think back
to her note.

190
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:31,291
She fully intended to strike the
mastermind where it hurt most.

191
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:32,708
[NAEGI] Guess she
meant business.

192
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:34,708
[KIRIGIRI] Yes. Good thing.

193
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:37,208
Without her help, I never
would have gotten inside.

194
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:40,416
And Mukuro Ikusaba
would still be a cipher.

195
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,416
Not that I've
learned everything,

196
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,958
but I can tell you
she's dangerous.

197
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:49,208
As a matter of fact,
she may well be our mastermind.

198
00:08:49,291 --> 00:08:50,458
Wait. So...

199
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:51,708
So it's a girl?

200
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:54,166
I thought Alter Ego
told us the mastermind

201
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:57,000
was supposed to be
the principal, right?

202
00:08:57,083 --> 00:08:58,291
He was wrong.

203
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:00,583
The principal couldn't
be the one behind this.

204
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:01,916
I mean.

205
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,875
I'm ninety-nine percent sure.

206
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:05,208
I think...

207
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:06,541
Either way,

208
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:09,000
I'd appreciate if you
kept this from the others.

209
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:11,125
least 'til we
have more to go on.

210
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:12,916
[NAEGI] Okay.

211
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,875
Look, I'll just come
right out an say this.

212
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:17,708
Whatever it is you're on to,

213
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:19,916
I really feel like
you oughta tell me.

214
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,916
[KIRIGIRI] I'm sorry, I'm...

215
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,958
not quite...

216
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:25,250
at a point where
I can articulate it.

217
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:30,041
I suspect you think I'm
being terribly unfair.

218
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:33,541
Which will no doubt make the
favor I need harder to grant.

219
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:35,791
Just hear me out...

220
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:38,041
I need to find what
this key goes to.

221
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:39,833
So, plan:

222
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:42,375
You keep Monokuma busy
while I go digging.

223
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:43,875
[NAEGI] By yourself?

224
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:46,208
Seriously? Come on!

225
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:48,166
That's way too dangerous
and you know it!

226
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:50,750
[KIRIGIRI] If it means cracking
the lid open on this school,

227
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:53,916
I'm willing to take a few risks.

228
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,125
Surely you agree that we
can't just sit on our hands?

229
00:09:57,208 --> 00:09:58,708
We must be bold.

230
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,750
But can I even trust you?

231
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,416
I'll do what I can.

232
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,166
But I'm gonna need you
to promise me something.

233
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:11,291
What...?

234
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:14,041
[NAEGI] Find out what
that key goes to safely.

235
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:16,000
Sure, risks may be necessary,

236
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:18,083
but don't go pushin'
things too far.

237
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:32,416
Monokuma!
Are you watchin'?

238
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,958
You and I need to have a chat.

239
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,333
[MONOKUMA] Quid pro quo,
Clarice...

240
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:42,000
Tell me what you and the
snoop were up to in the sauna,

241
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:43,708
and I'll be happy to.

242
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:45,875
Though, given the lack
of cameras in there,

243
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:47,666
I bet I can guess...

244
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:50,583
You two were doin'
the deed, weren't ya?

245
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:53,208
Goin' at it like a
couple of sea otters?!

246
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:55,541
[MONOKUMA] Well, poop!

247
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:57,291
Fine, be a gentlemen.

248
00:10:57,375 --> 00:10:59,666
No kiss an' tell for you, eh?

249
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,625
It's not like I need
the juicy details.

250
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:03,750
Keep things tasteful,
that's my motto.

251
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:06,333
No TV-MA for this bear,
thank you very much!

252
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,791
Wait, that's the reason there's
no surveillance cameras

253
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:09,583
in the sauna?

254
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:11,291
[MONOKUMA] But of course!

255
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:12,416
Whatever, man.

256
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,166
You know it's the humidity.

257
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:16,583
The lenses would just
fog up all the time.

258
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:20,375
Who'd wanna hook up here?

259
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:22,625
[MONOKUMA] Is that what you
dragged me away from the office

260
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:23,958
to stuff my ear-holes with?

261
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:25,250
Out with it, emo!

262
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:26,958
The treasure you
mentioned was stolen.

263
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:27,791
What was it?

264
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:28,583
[MONOKUMA] Really?

265
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:30,291
You're killin' me, Smalls!

266
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:33,291
Of all the worthless twaddle
to waste my time with!

267
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:36,333
You're like a jolt of stupid
through a frayed wire!

268
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:38,958
This can't be why you
and me needed to chat.

269
00:11:39,041 --> 00:11:43,375
Are all pubescent boys this much
of a pain in the robo-keester?

270
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:45,083
[MONOKUMA sighs]

271
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:46,916
[MONOKUMA]
Regarding said treasure...

272
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,708
None of your damn
business, jackass!

273
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:51,625
[NAEGI] Hey, don't
walk away from me!

274
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:53,083
I'm not done talkin' to you!

275
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:59,333
Well, hope that did the trick.

276
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:01,666
Just... please be okay.

277
00:12:17,666 --> 00:12:19,708
[NAEGI] Of course...

278
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:22,291
Why didn't I see it before?

279
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:25,625
I'm not supposed to
leave Hope's Peak...

280
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:28,125
I need to stay...

281
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:31,541
That's the whole point;
for me to be here...

282
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:34,083
To help everyone...

283
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,958
[NAEGI] Is somebody there?

284
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:46,833
[NAEGI gasps]

285
00:12:57,333 --> 00:12:59,041
[NAEGI] Kiri?

286
00:12:59,125 --> 00:12:59,875
Wha...

287
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:01,458
What are you doing?

288
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:04,791
[NAEGI] What?

289
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:05,458
I...

290
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:07,541
I can't...

291
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:08,250
hear...

292
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:09,708
you...

293
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:16,791
[MONOKUMA] Good morning,
good morning-a!

294
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:19,541
Seven o'clock in
the AM, sleepy heads!

295
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:22,166
Time to greet the
rosy fingered dawn!

296
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:24,166
Let's see those
feet on the floor

297
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,416
and those eyes on the prize!

298
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,250
[NAEGI] What was
with that dream?

299
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:29,708
[NAEGI gasps]

300
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:33,333
Crap, where's the knife?!

301
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:34,750
Was I dreaming?

302
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:37,833
Or did somebody actually
try to attack me?

303
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:40,791
Do I tell the others
or keep it to myself?

304
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:42,125
I dunno...

305
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:45,166
silence is probably the
best option for right now.

306
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:48,333
[NAEGI] Huh?

307
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:50,458
Where is everybody?

308
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:53,291
C'mon guys, what's happening?

309
00:13:56,375 --> 00:13:57,791
Way to keep me in the loop.

310
00:13:57,875 --> 00:13:59,250
Wha--?!

311
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:03,500
Are you out of your minds?!

312
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:04,791
He's gonna kill you!

313
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:06,625
Ugh, don't make a scene.

314
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:09,000
Yeah, no bigs,
he was already busted.

315
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:11,291
[NAEGI] Somebody wanna
clue me in, please?

316
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:13,083
[TOGAMI] I couldn't
sleep last night.

317
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:16,500
Monokuma's "treasure" kept
rattling around in my head.

318
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:19,833
I thought "why not ask him
about it yourself," and, well,

319
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:21,833
when I came looking for him...

320
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:22,875
here he was.

321
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:25,541
Completely inert.

322
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:28,625
When it was clear he wasn't a
threat, I gathered everyone.

323
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:31,583
We've since been burning the
midnight oil disassembling him.

324
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:32,708
Yes we have!

325
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:34,750
Master Togami's a genius!

326
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:37,000
He got a chance to see what
makes the bear tick,

327
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:38,041
and he jumped at it!

328

Yeah...

329
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:41,625
I tried to come get ya, but
you wouldn't answer your door.

330
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:43,458
I was down for the count.

331
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:46,000
More power to ya;
we didn't get a wink.

332
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:51,250
[HAGAKURE] This is not
a Magic 8 Ball, guys!

333
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:52,666
Interesting.

[TOGAMI] I would suspect it is

What could go wrong?!

343
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:08,958
Calm down! You'll kill us all!

00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:10,541
Oh, dear, I'm sorry.

345
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:13,875

already deactivated the sensor?

So, uh...

350
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:23,458
Anybody know why Monokuma
just stopped working?

351
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:25,708
I've a feeling something
unforeseen befell

352
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:28,958
the mastermind pulling
Monokuma's strings.

353
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:31,458
He seems to be a mouthpiece
for the principal.

354
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:34,291
The man Alter Ego
believed to be behind this.

[NAEGI gasps]

Only problem though...

357
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:39,166
Kiri said the principal couldn't
be the mastermind, and...

358
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:40,708
She was pretty adamant about it.

359
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:44,958
Snap out of it; the woman
is mendacity personified.

Either way, our
course is clear.

361
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:49,041
The next move in this
morbid scavenger hunt

362
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:51,250
is a trip to the
principal's office.

You have one minute to fetch
a mattock and bring it here.

Why not?

371
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:09,416
With Monokuma out of commission,
we needn't fear reprisals.

00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,541
[NAEGI] Has Kiri done something?

373
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:15,791
Does she actually know
who the mastermind is?

she didn't get caught.

Now we can nail
down that other one.

mystery would that be?

I can't answer the
first question yet,

00:17:10,916 --> 00:17:12,916
but to the second,
I'd say: murder.

401

the fact the blood hasn't dried.

It's most likely Kirigiri.

[TOGAMI] I beg your pardon?

of working hypothesis

about another student
hiding here on campus.

[TOGAMI] No... No,

00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:51,708
[ASAHINA] Why...

485
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:53,833
Why are we on television?

486
00:20:53,916 --> 00:20:55,250
[NAEGI] What is this?

487
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:57,166
[ASAHINA] Uhhmm...

488
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:00,583
[MONOKUMA "School Life
of Mutual Killing!"

489
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:04,125
The highest-rated
television show in history!

490
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:05,541
Brought to you live!

491
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:07,375
Twenty-four seven!

492
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:10,083
What is the point of
something like that?

493
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:11,333
[MONOKUMA] The point?

494
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:13,916
There's a point behind
every move I've made.

495
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,500
Thick, aren't ya?

496
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:17,791
I've been spoon-feedin'
you people hints

497
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:21,541
about the real purpose behind
this school from day one.

498
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:23,208
You think you
were lured here

499
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:25,541
for my personal
satisfaction alone?

500
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:26,666
Oh, I see...

501
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:28,416
You thought dropping
this bombshell

502
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,291
would be a nice ratings-booster.

503
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:32,041
[MONOKUMA] Don't be so cynical!

504
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:33,625
This is art!

505
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:37,625
We're pushin' the envelope here,
hoisting this puppy from mundane

506
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:41,208
to meta, and the
public just eats it up!

507
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:43,958
This is the ultimate
reality show!

508
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:48,333
I call it: "Despair-o-tainment!"

509
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:49,708
You're lying!

510
00:21:49,791 --> 00:21:52,375
If this was really airing live,
the cops or whoever

511
00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:53,916
would've come for us by now!

512
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,041
[MONOKUMA] You really think so?

513
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:57,375
What does that mean?!

514
00:21:57,458 --> 00:21:59,083
[MONOKUMA] Say cops
are watching it...

515
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:00,916
Would it even be their problem?

516
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,250
Mightn't they love watching
you squirm as much

517
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:05,083
as the next bloodthirsty John Q?

518
00:22:05,166 --> 00:22:06,458
Who backs you?!

519
00:22:06,541 --> 00:22:08,583
This kind of setup requires
astronomical funding,

520
00:22:08,666 --> 00:22:11,083
the equipment alone
must run in the millions!

521
00:22:11,166 --> 00:22:11,875
Where do you--?

522
00:22:11,958 --> 00:22:13,458
[MONOKUMA laughs]

523
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:16,541
[MONOKUMA] Hard to imagine
anyone goin' to these lengths?

524
00:22:16,625 --> 00:22:18,333
I still have my secrets.

525
00:22:18,416 --> 00:22:21,083
But forget that now,
focus on the task at hand.

526
00:22:21,166 --> 00:22:23,000
[ASAHINA] Which
is what, exactly?

527
00:22:23,083 --> 00:22:24,416
[MONOKUMA] You found a body.

528
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,875
The rules haven't changed.

529
00:22:26,958 --> 00:22:28,583
[TOGAMI] You mean for
us to have a trial.

530
00:22:28,666 --> 00:22:29,583
[MONOKUMA] Bingo!

531
00:22:29,666 --> 00:22:31,291
The show must go on,
dear-hearts!

532
00:22:31,375 --> 00:22:33,000
That's how this business goes.

533
00:22:33,083 --> 00:22:36,500
And there's no business
like it; no business I know!

534
00:22:38,416 --> 00:22:41,333
[MONOKUMA] ♪ Da-da-da-duuuuum! ♪

Corpse alert, junior dicks!

536

You know the drill:
investigation, then, trial!

537
00:23:49,125 --> 00:23:52,333
[KIRIGIRI] I'd say our situation
has taken a dire turn.

538
00:23:52,416 --> 00:23:53,833
Kirigiri!

539
00:23:53,916 --> 00:23:55,083
Where've you been?!

540
00:23:55,166 --> 00:23:56,750
You were a huge help, Naegi.

541
00:23:56,833 --> 00:24:00,000
Thanks for running interference.

542
00:24:00,083 --> 00:24:01,041
[NAEGI] Whatever.

I'm just glad you're alive.

544
00:24:02,916 --> 00:24:04,875
I believe he asked
you a question.

545
00:24:04,958 --> 00:24:06,958
We totally thought
you were dead!

546
00:24:07,041 --> 00:24:09,500
[KIRIGIRI] Sorry to disappoint.

547
00:24:09,583 --> 00:24:10,708
Hold on a minute...

548
00:24:10,791 --> 00:24:13,541
If that corpse wasn't you,
then who was it?

549
00:24:13,625 --> 00:24:14,416
[KIRIGIRI] Mukuro...

550
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:17,000
Ikusaba.

551
00:24:17,083 --> 00:24:19,791
There were sixteen
of us, you see.

00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:22,458
Her Super High-School talent...

was despair.
