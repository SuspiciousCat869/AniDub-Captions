1
00:00:26,791 --> 00:00:29,791
[NAEGI] And just like that,
Maizono was gone.

00:00:29,875 --> 00:00:32,375
Almost like she'd never
been here to begin with.

3
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:37,083
[NAEGI] Damn that
little two-tone psycho!

4
00:00:37,166 --> 00:00:40,500
Thanks to his sadistic rules,
we can't even mourn her death.

5
00:00:40,583 --> 00:00:42,458
Anyone's death...

6
00:00:42,541 --> 00:00:44,125
I keep pinching myself...

7
00:00:44,208 --> 00:00:45,666
but I never wake up.

8
00:02:22,583 --> 00:02:25,000
[MONOKUMA] Every time you
sad-sacks survive a death-match

00:02:25,083 --> 00:02:27,750
with Lady Justice,
you get a shiny presie.

10
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:31,000
It's a whole new world!
Don't you dare close your eyes!

11
00:02:31,083 --> 00:02:34,291
As much as I'd love to split you
open from chins to cha-chas,

12
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:36,791
it's my principal-y duty to
stimulate that oatmeal

13
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:38,166
you call brains...

14
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:39,625
Happy hunting, chill'uns!

15
00:02:39,708 --> 00:02:42,375
And don't say I never
gave you nothin'.

[HAGAKURE]
"Whole new world"?

Dude. It's a stairwell.

18
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:50,916
[NAEGI] Looks like he
gave us the second floor.

19
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,416
[KIRIGIRI] Our data's
been updated, as well.

20
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,916
In that case...

21
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,291
Guess we'd better head up
there and check it out.

22
00:02:58,375 --> 00:03:00,416
[ASAHINA] Turn that frown
upside down, Naegi!

23
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,250
We'll get outta here if we
work together. I'm sure of it!

24
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:05,625
[TOGAMI] Please, spare us
your blandishments, woman!

25
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:08,208
One of our compatriots
butchered another...

26
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:12,000
Once that line has been crossed,
further villainy is assured.

27
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:14,625
[FUKAWA] That dead girl really
screwed us all over,

28
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:16,250
didn't she...?

29
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:17,666
[ASAHINA] O-okay...

30
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:20,291
Look, if we want to save
ourselves, we need to team up

31
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:21,416
and figure out who's
actually pulling th--

32
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,625
[TOGAMI] Quiet, you!

33
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:25,333
Lest we all drown
in your naiveté.

34
00:03:25,416 --> 00:03:26,916
[YAMADA] Care to explain that?

35
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,125
[CELESTIA] What he's
trying to say is...

36
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:31,958
whoever kidnapped us has a lot
more clout at their disposal

37
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:33,458
than we assumed at first...

38
00:03:33,541 --> 00:03:35,250
He's out of our league.

39
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:37,958
[OHGAMI] What're we supposed
to do, then? Give up?

40
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:40,208
[TOGAMI] The bear has been
very frank with us.

41
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:43,458
To graduate, one need only
deceive his classmates.

42
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:45,208
And given my classmates,

43
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:46,708
there's nothing to it.

44
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:47,750
[FUJISAKI] But...

45
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:49,541
it's deceiving them
about murder...

46
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:51,416
I don't wanna kill anyone!

47
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,875
I can't!

48
00:03:58,458 --> 00:04:02,041
[YAMADA] Hmm... read it...
read it... hated it...

49
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:06,125
[TOGAMI sighs]

50
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:07,791
It won't even turn on.

51
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:09,291
Cut-rate piece of junk.

52
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:11,708
Not that I believed we
could Google our way out

53
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:14,500
of this mess, but it
did cross my mind.

54
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:16,750
Well... any luck?

55
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:18,208
Uh?

[BOTH gasp]

59
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:25,458
According to the envelope,

60
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:27,125
it's a note from
the principal.

61
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:28,875
What do we got...?

62
00:04:28,958 --> 00:04:30,416
Huh?!

63
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,541
Going by what I see here, this
isn't even a school anymore.

"School operations
will resume...

once the issues have been
resolved." What's that about?

66
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:43,083
Apparently, this place stopped
being a legitimate school

67
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:45,541
before we ever set
foot on campus.

68
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:47,416
[NAEGI] I don't know
how it was for you,

69
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:50,583
but it looked plenty
legit when I showed up.

70
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:53,375
Apparently, the author
of our misfortune claimed it

71
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:54,875
once it was deserted,

72
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:57,791
and then he set the stage
for this twisted little play.

73
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:00,458
[TOGAMI] Look at this...

74
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:03,166
Sensationalist trash
of the lowest order.

75
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,375
But in here, it serves
as a textbook.

00:05:05,458 --> 00:05:07,416
Yeah, don't remind me.

77
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,625
[TOGAMI] It's not often that
life grants you reason

78
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:12,833
to feel such
delicious frisson.

79
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:15,666
The least we can do
is enjoy ourselves.

80
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:19,250
What the hell...?

81
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:21,500
[OHWADA] That little piss-ant's
treating it like a game!

00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:23,416
You're in danger too, y'know!

It is a game,
you philistine.

84
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:28,333
[CELESTIA] A zero-sum
game, correct?

85
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:30,458
Whatever you win,
you take from another.

86
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:33,916
Vying for spots at a good
school, promotions at work...

87
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,583
And in this scenario...

88
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:38,666
the prize is life itself,
but only for one of us.

Honestly, the thought that you
might not survive this game

92
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:47,375
has never once crossed
your mind, has it?

[CELESTIA giggles]

I would expect no less from the

like the Togami Corporation.

The world must look
different to you.

For a Super High School Level
heir such as you,

99
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:03,000
challenges simply exist
as accolades to be won.

100
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:06,333
Even with your life on
the line, you don't waver.

101
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:08,333
So you do understand me.

102

Shall I spell it out for
the rest of you plebeians?

103

You had better try
your damndest to win!

Friends aren't supposed
to kill each other!

We are not friends.

We are strangers, death-locked
in a fight for survival.

But... that's so... ruthless--

00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:12,666
[ALL exhale]

159
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,625
Soooo... Anyway...

160
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:16,708
Since more areas
have been unlocked,

161
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:18,708
how about we go check out
the pool situation?

162
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:21,166
Bet a quick dip
will do us some good.

163
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,208
[OHGAMI] Hmm...

164
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:23,583
Good idea.

165
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:25,458
What are we waiting for?

166
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:27,625
[ASAHINA] You, too.
It'll make you feel better.

167
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:29,750
Oh! I, uh...

168
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:35,000
[ASAHINA] All right.
Locker room, twelve o'clock.

169
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:39,000
Dang. I guess we'll have
to take a rain-check.

170
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:40,375
[MONOKUMA] Au contraire!

171
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:42,583
All you gotta do to
open that pesky door

172
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:44,458
is press your handy-dandy
digital notebook

173
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:45,250
up to the lock.

174
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:47,625
Ta-da! Problem solved!

175
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:49,583
Just 'cause I want y'all
to slaughter each other

176
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:51,000
doesn't mean anything goes.

177
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:53,958
So! No boys in the
girls' locker room,

178
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:55,791
and no girls in the
boys' locker room.

179
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:57,583
Capiche?

180
00:08:57,666 --> 00:09:00,333
What if a girl held the door
open and a boy snuck in?

181
00:09:00,416 --> 00:09:03,333
or what if they held their
door open for one of us?

182
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:05,000
[MONOKUMA] I think
Mr. Gatling Gun

183
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:06,708
will find the "holes"
in their logic?

184
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:08,166
Get it?! Roll tape!

185
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:12,375
[ASAHINA] Time out!
Anyone you shoot with

186
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:14,125
that thing is dead meat!

187
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:16,916
[FUJISAKI] I think...
that's the idea...

188
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,416
What happens if we borrow
a notebook from a boy

189
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,625
and try to use it?

190
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:21,500
[MONOKUMA] Hmm...

191
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:23,500
I never even thought of that!

192
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:25,041
Incoming rule change!

193
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:27,541
"Lending your digital
notebook to another student

194
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:30,541
is strictly prohibited."
Good thing you said something,

195
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:32,750
or you could've totally
gamed the system!

196
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:35,291
And that would have
been unbearable!

197
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:37,250
Toodle-loo, kids!

198
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:38,500
Yeah, you guys,

199
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:40,250
I don't really feel like
hitting the pool now.

200
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:42,875
He probably filled it
with piranhas, anyway...

201
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:55,416
[NAEGI] Huh. dark in here.

202
00:09:57,333 --> 00:09:58,583
Fukawa, hey.

203
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:01,083
[TOGAMI] Please, could
you be any more obvious?

204
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:03,083
The sight of you repulses me.

205
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:03,958
[TOGAMI sniffs]

206
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:06,125
But I can smell you from here.

207
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:07,416
Take a shower.

208
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,291
[FUKAWA gasps]

209
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:10,250
Don't make me repeat myself.

210
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:11,875
Just do as I tell you.

211
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:14,500
Your stench is an insult.

212
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:15,291
What?!

213
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:17,166
Oh... okay...

214
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:23,500
[NAEGI] Fukawa, wait!

215
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:28,625
Look, I wouldn't take all that
stuff to heart, you know?

216
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:30,083
[FUKAWA]
I can't believe him...

217
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:31,541
Togami is such...

218
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:33,458
He's such a...!

219
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:36,458
He's such an absolute
dreamboat, isn't he?!

220
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:37,666
Huh?!

221
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:40,208
He took the time to
tell me to clean myself!

222
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:42,791
Well? What do you
think of us, Naegi?

223
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:44,333
[NAEGI] Hold on... Us who?

224
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:47,500
[FUKAWA] Me and Togami, duh!
Aren't we the perfect couple?!

225
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:50,625
Heh... Maybe you think our
love is one-sided, but...

226
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:51,583
you're wrong!

227
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:54,916
Oh, Togami! I'm yours forever!

228
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,833
Oookay, then.

229
00:10:56,916 --> 00:11:01,166
[FUKAWA giggles]

230
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:03,750
They sure broke the mold
when they made that one.

231
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,791
[ISHIMARU] Ah, Naegi, perfect!

232
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:11,291
Your timing is impeccable!

233
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:12,583
What's going on?!

234
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:14,000
We need a ref,

235
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:16,125
and you're the first to show up,
so you get the job...

236
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:19,166
Goody-Goody-Two-Shoes here
keeps shooting his mouth off.

237
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:21,666
Thinks I lack self-control
or some crap!

238
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,041
Well, of course you lack it!

239
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:24,500
If you had self-control,

240
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:26,916
you wouldn't answer every
challenge with your fists!

241
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,166
Yeah?! Says the guy who
yells all the damn time?!

242
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:32,375
I got more self-control
than you, a-hole!

243
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:33,625
That'll be the day!

244
00:11:33,708 --> 00:11:35,833
You talk a big game,
Poindexter!

245
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:39,041
Let's see if you got
the balls to back it up!

246
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:40,666
Hey! Lemme go!

247
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:47,125
So... you guys?

248
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:49,125
It's been like 40 minutes.

249
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,666
You still okay in there?

250
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,791
You're lookin' pretty
pink there, Pollyanna!

251
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:54,958
How's that self-control
treating ya?!

252
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:57,125
This is my regular
complexion!

253
00:11:57,208 --> 00:11:59,041
You're sweating
like a stuck pig!

00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:00,166
[ISHIMARU laughs]

255
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:02,250
This level of heat
is child's play!

256
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:05,250
Let me know when it
actually warms up!

257
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:06,833
Why don't we
call it a tie?

258
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:08,083
--[ISHIMARU] The hell with that!
--[OHWADA] The hell with that!

259
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:10,083
Don'tcha think we'd be
better off in our rooms?

260
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:11,625
It is after ten.

261
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:14,208
[ISHIMARU] Winning this duel is
the only thing that matters!

262
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:15,875
[OHWADA] Too bad for you, then!

263

I've faced more heat
than the devil's nutsack!

Naegi, we got this!

265
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:21,833
You can go!

266
00:12:21,916 --> 00:12:23,916
All right. Be careful, guys!

267
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:32,000
[laughter]

268
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:33,208
Huh...?

269
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:35,000
[OHWADA] Aw, man!
You're such a kidder!

270
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:38,333
Maybe you just have a great
sense of humor, friend-o!

271
00:12:38,416 --> 00:12:39,958
Hey, Naegi! How's it hangin'?

272
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:42,333
Yeah, thanks for helping
out with our little duel!

273
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:44,000
They're friends now?

Who knows? But I
think it's hella creepy,

275
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:47,500
whether they're
faking it or not.

[BOTH laugh]

277
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:51,208
As if a girl could ever
understand the bond

00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:52,958
forged between two men!

279
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:55,625
Ours is a friendship
tempered in flame itself!

280
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:58,541
[OHWADA] Dude, I love it
when you get all poetic!

281
00:12:58,625 --> 00:13:01,333
So? Which one of you
left the sauna first?

282
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:03,458
That's water under
the bridge, little man!

283
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:05,125
Put our duel out
of your mind.

Huh?

The milk tea was not to
your liking, I assume?

291
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,250
Serving me this swill was
a culinary slap in the face.

slopped into a cup.

you corpulent bootlicker!

Yes! At once! Your bootlicker
is on the case, milady!

316
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:29,916
With that in mind,
today's theme is:

317
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,250
"Embarrassing Memories"

318
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:34,375
or, "The Past Secrets
You Want Kept Secret"!

319
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:35,833
YOLO!

320
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:45,833
Aaah! How'd you know?!

321
00:14:45,916 --> 00:14:47,375
If the others found out--!

322
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:49,291
[MONOKUMA]
Skeletons aren't my forte,

323
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:52,291
being a stuffed bear and all,
but every human has

324
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:53,791
at least one of 'em
swinging around

325
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:55,875
in their closet all secret-like.

326
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:58,750
[NAEGI] "Naegi wet the
bed until the fifth grade"?

327
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:00,083
Aw, jeez...

328
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:01,208
I mean...

329
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:03,500
it'd suck if they
found out, but...

330
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:04,958
[MONOKUMA laughs]

331
00:15:05,041 --> 00:15:06,625
[MONOKUMA] Time's
a-wastin', giblets!

332
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:09,583
If I don't get a corpse outta
one of you in 24 hours,

333
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:11,875
your skeletons will all
be front-page news!

334
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:15,041
And trust me, we've got
some real doozies in here!

335
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:17,083
 Well, smell ya later!

336
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:23,041
Yeah, so, no one's gonna
go on a killing spree

337
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:25,333
to keep their secret
a secret, are they?

338
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:28,750
[NAEGI]
Is there something so bad

339
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:31,500
to make it worth killing for?

340
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,791
I wouldn't have believed
it back before this place,

341
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:35,875
but now I just don't know.

342
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,083
[NAEGI] Assuming
the worst of people

343
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:41,000
isn't going to help anything.

344
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:44,500
[NAEGI] Yeah...
Suck it up, Naegi.

345
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:45,958
We'll all be fine.

346
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:00,416
[MONOKUMA]
Top o' the morning, all!

347
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:03,750
[MONOKUMA]
Hyuck-hyuck-hyuck-hyuck!

348
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:06,041
While you were busy
drooling into your pillows,

349
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:08,958
one of your classmates
dished out a little homicide!

350
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:11,375
I wonder who bit
the big one...?

351
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:16,458
Who're we missing?

352
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:18,458
Too soon to say yet, brah.

353
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:19,625
But yet again...

354
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:21,625
one of us has turned
into a killer.

355
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:23,250
But do you really
believe that?

356
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:25,500
Who'd kill someone
over a dumb secret?

357
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:27,250
[TOGAMI] Dumb to you perhaps.

358
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:31,291
But not all secrets
are created equal.

359
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:33,416
Let's look for clues.

360
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,541
Naegi...

361
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:35,750
You're with me.

362
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:37,208
Huh...?

363
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:43,416
The locker room.

364
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,583
A prime setting for
the taking of a life.

365
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:49,458
Huh? Yeah, if
you say so, Togami.

366
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:50,166
Wait!

367
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:52,125
Guys can't go in there!

368
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:56,375
Open sesame.

369
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:58,541
[MONOKUMA] I've lifted the
restrictions on these rooms

370
00:16:58,625 --> 00:16:59,750
while you investigate.

371
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:02,458
There's plenty of time
to shoot you later.

372
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,125
[TOGAMI gasps]

373
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:08,708
[NAEGI gasps]

374
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:16,416
[NAEGI screams]

375
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,875
No! It's Fujisaki!

376
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:23,208
[TOGAMI] Written in blood...

377
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:25,708
"Blood bath fever," huh?

378
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:27,333
Interesting...

379
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:30,208
There's something
primal about the scene.

380
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:32,500
Most definitely.

381
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:33,583
[ISHIMARU]
Hey, guys, what's--

382
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:36,250
[ISHIMARU screams]

383
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:38,333
[MONOKUMA] We're three
for three, sports fans!

384
00:17:38,416 --> 00:17:39,708
And you know
what that means!

385
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:42,291
A li'l free time to collect
your thoughts, and...

386
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:43,416
Boomshakalaka!

387
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,208
Trial!

388
00:17:45,291 --> 00:17:47,375
What...? I don't...

389
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:49,333
[TOGAMI] It's part of
the ritual here.

390
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:50,541
Oh, right.

391
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:52,666
When he made the
announcement for Maizono,

392
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,791
you were still asleep. I forgot.

393
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:58,083
Once three people find a corpse,
the clock starts ticking.

394
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:01,541
[TOGAMI] Ishimaru!
Go round up the rest of us!

395
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:03,625
[ISHIMARU] Uh yeah, on it!

396
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:05,375
Another killer
on the loose...

397
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:08,583
And the game is officially
afoot once again.

398
00:18:09,916 --> 00:18:11,791
[NAEGI] The others joined us
in the locker room

399
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:14,541
in what seemed
like record time.

400
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:16,333
We stared at the body;

401
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:19,333
fear and anger
clouding our faces.

402
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:22,333
One of us was looking
at their own handiwork.

403
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:23,375
But who...?

404
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:24,958
[FUKAWA] B-b-b-b-blood...!

405
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:29,458
[NAEGI]
"Victim is Chihiro Fujisaki."

406
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:32,750
"Time of death: Roughly 2 a.m."

407
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:35,416
"The corpse was found in
the 2nd floor girls' locker room

408
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,166
in the classroom area."

409
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:41,083
"The fatal injury was a blow
to the head by a blunt object."

410
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:43,708
"Death occurred instantly."

411
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:45,833
That dumbbell over
there is the weapon.

412
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:48,125
It's gotta be.

413
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:51,458
And I think they
killed her right here.

414
00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:52,916
[KIRIGI gasps]

415
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:58,458
[KIRIGIRI] That's not rope.
It's an extension cord.

416
00:18:58,541 --> 00:19:02,375
[NAEGI] Extension cord, huh?
Wasn't there one in the library?

417
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:06,583
[KIRIGIRI] Yes... I do seem
to remember seeing it there.

418
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:08,000
[NAEGI] Hey...

419
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:10,875
You don't see her digital
notebook anywhere, do you?

420
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:13,208
It's gotta be around...

421
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:15,666
[HAGAKURE] Hey, look!
Another dying message!

422
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,583
[ASAHINA]
Slow your roll, Hardy Boy.

423
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:18,833
[OHGAMI] Huh...

424
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:20,958
After I was done with
my workout last night,

425
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:23,291
I spilled my protein
coffee on this rug,

426
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:25,875
but now there's no sign
of the stain that it left.

427
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:28,958
[NAEGI] How does a
coffee stain disappear?

428
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:30,208
Wait...

429
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:32,583
that pin-up seems like
kind of an odd choice...

430
00:19:34,958 --> 00:19:37,250
[NAEGI] So, what
do we have in ours?

431
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:41,291
[NAEGI] A poster
from some boy-band?

432
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:43,500
I don't get it.

433
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:46,666
I last saw Fujisaki
back in the storage area.

434
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:50,041
She had a jersey in a duffel
bag, and she was in a rush.

435
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:55,250
Maybe she
rendezvoused with someone.

436
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:57,583
If they met up here,
then where's her bag?

437
00:19:57,666 --> 00:20:00,166
This is the work
of Genocider Sho.

438
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:02,875
Wait... How do I
know that name...?

439
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:05,791
Y'mean that serial killer
who popped up recently?

440
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:10,458
Curious yet? I'll allow you
to aid my investigation.

441
00:20:10,541 --> 00:20:11,375
Uh?

442
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:12,833
Follow me.

443
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:17,291
[NAEGI] Hey, you know,
I just thought of something.

444
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:21,041
The Genocider Sho murders have
been a pretty big deal lately.

445
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:23,125
So, maybe we're
dealing with a copycat?

446
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:24,458
Sorry.

447
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:26,416
How can you be so sure?

448
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:29,208
Easily. Now hold your
tongue and listen.

449
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:48,500
[NAEGI] Whoa.
Confidential police files?

450
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:51,666
[TOGAMI] Normally, this
information is not released

451
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,208
to the public.

452
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:55,541
What the heck are they
even doing here?!

453
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:58,125
How do we know this
stuff is for real?

454
00:20:58,208 --> 00:21:01,000
[TOGAMI] Your skepticism is
healthy, but I assure you,

455
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:02,416
these are genuine.

456
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:05,666
They match the copies
in my study at home.

457
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:07,541
Look, I get
that you're rich,

458
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:09,333
but they don't just
hand that info out.

459
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:11,416
[TOGAMI] That's one
of your weaknesses.

460
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:15,166
If something doesn't match
your ideals, you disregard it.

461
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:18,250
Here's the dossier
on Genocider Sho.

462
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:19,708
[NAEGI gasps]

463
00:21:19,791 --> 00:21:21,666
[TOGAMI] He always writes
"Blood bath fever" in blood

464
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:24,166
at the murder scene,
the victims are always male,

465
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:26,250
and scissors are
always the weapon.

466
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:31,250
[TOGAMI] Based on his profile,
Sho might suffer from

467
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:33,625
dissociative identity disorder--

468
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:37,291
what we used to call
"multiple personalities."

469
00:21:37,375 --> 00:21:40,958
Also, every one of his victims
thus far has been crucified,

470
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:44,583
although that detail is only
known to a select few officers.

471
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:46,791
You really... think that...

472
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:49,666
Genocider Sho is
in here with us?!

473
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:55,833
[ASAHINA] Thank goodness
I found you two!

474
00:21:55,916 --> 00:21:58,375
Fukawa's gone off
the deep end!

475
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,708
[ASAHINA] She's been acting off
ever since we found the body.

476
00:22:02,791 --> 00:22:05,416
Now she's locked in her room,
but yelled through the door that

477
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,375
she wants to talk to Togami.

478
00:22:07,458 --> 00:22:08,541
[doorbell rings]

479
00:22:08,625 --> 00:22:10,041
[ASAHINA] You doing
all right in there?

480
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:12,416
I brought Togami!

481
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,916
[FUKAWA] He's really here...?

482
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:21,083
I'm so sorry, Togami...

483
00:22:21,166 --> 00:22:22,875
I couldn't keep my promise...

484
00:22:22,958 --> 00:22:26,291
I thought I could,
but it was just too hard!

485
00:22:28,083 --> 00:22:29,250
[FUKAWA] But... y'know?!

486
00:22:29,333 --> 00:22:31,916
I'm okay! I've got
it under control!

487
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,208
I'm calling the shots again!

488
00:22:34,291 --> 00:22:35,625
Listen up:

489
00:22:35,708 --> 00:22:38,458
Genocider Sho is not gonna
add me to her body-count!

490
00:22:39,583 --> 00:22:41,833
--[doorbell ringing]
--Fukawa, wait! Open the door!

491
00:22:41,916 --> 00:22:43,833
--[NAEGI] What...
--None of that made any sense!

492
00:22:43,916 --> 00:22:46,958
--What is going on here...?
--Try again without the crazy?

493
00:22:47,041 --> 00:22:50,625
--[intercom chimes]
--Okay? Fukawa?!

494
00:22:50,708 --> 00:22:52,750
[MONOKUMA] I know the idea's
that I give you toddlers

495
00:22:52,833 --> 00:22:54,416
a chance to figure
out whodunit,

496
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,333
but this is like
watching paint dry!

497
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:57,916
Enough shufflin' your feet!

498
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,500
It's time to Trial!
