1
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,416
[NAEGI] We're here in
the courtroom again.

2
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,250
As much as I'd hoped
it was a one-time thing,

3
00:00:24,333 --> 00:00:26,166
we've had another murder.

4
00:00:27,375 --> 00:00:29,666
[NAEGI] And now it's on
us to find the killer,

5
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:32,166
or we'll be the next to die!

6
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:33,750
I hope we can pull this off...

7
00:00:42,875 --> 00:00:45,500
[MONOKUMA] Well then, my sweet
and tender hooligans,

8
00:00:45,583 --> 00:00:47,125
why don't we kick things off

9
00:00:47,208 --> 00:00:49,250
by talking about
the murder weapon?

10
00:00:51,333 --> 00:00:53,250
According to the
Monokuma Files,

11
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:56,041
the victim was struck in the
head with a blunt object,

12
00:00:56,125 --> 00:00:58,375
leading to what was most
likely an immediate demise.

13
00:00:58,458 --> 00:01:00,083
Yes, but what could it've been?

14
00:01:00,166 --> 00:01:02,375
Hey, I bet it was
a metal pipe!

15
00:01:02,458 --> 00:01:04,000
No, that wasn't the weapon!

16
00:01:06,083 --> 00:01:08,208
Duh, right! What
was I thinking?!

17
00:01:08,291 --> 00:01:10,791
There weren't any pipes
at the scene of the crime,

18
00:01:10,875 --> 00:01:12,291
so I don't think it was that.

19
00:01:12,375 --> 00:01:13,750
The circumference of the injury

20
00:01:13,833 --> 00:01:15,666
matched the weight at the
end of a small dumbbell.

21
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:18,291
Wait! You checked out
her crunched-in head?!

22
00:01:18,375 --> 00:01:19,875
Ahhh! I bet
there were brains!

23
00:01:19,958 --> 00:01:22,083
Given the bloodstains
we found on the carpet,

24
00:01:22,166 --> 00:01:25,291
I think it's safe to assume the
crime was committed right there,

25
00:01:25,375 --> 00:01:26,666
in the girls' locker room.

26
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:28,958
Thus, it's high time
to name the culprit.

27
00:01:29,041 --> 00:01:30,833
Would you care to
rack your brains,

28
00:01:30,916 --> 00:01:32,541
or shall I just
tell you who it is?

29
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:34,125
You know who did it?!

30
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:35,916
[TOGAMI] Obviously...

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,541
Chihiro Fujisaki's killer is...

32
00:01:38,625 --> 00:01:40,375
Genocider Sho!

33
00:01:40,458 --> 00:01:42,750
Wait a minute. That serial
killer who was in the news?

34
00:01:42,833 --> 00:01:44,083
Whatever, brah!

35
00:01:44,166 --> 00:01:46,291
But wouldn't that have to
mean that raving lunatic

36
00:01:46,375 --> 00:01:48,666
is one of us?!
That's crazy-talk!

37
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:50,958
[NAEGI] It's not as
crazy as you think.

38
00:01:51,041 --> 00:01:55,375
Togami and I found a dossier
on the killer in the library.

39
00:01:55,458 --> 00:01:58,125
[TOGAMI] It called attention to
recurring motifs throughout

40
00:01:58,208 --> 00:02:00,041
all of Genocider Sho's murders:

41
00:02:00,125 --> 00:02:02,541
Two rituals, or calling
cards, in particular...

42
00:02:02,625 --> 00:02:06,333
First, Sho always leaves a
message written in blood.

43
00:02:06,416 --> 00:02:08,958
[YAMADA] Yes, "Funbag fever,"
if I'm not mistaken.

44
00:02:09,041 --> 00:02:10,875
"Blood bath fever," y'mean?

45
00:02:10,958 --> 00:02:14,375
The second motif is important,
as it's never been disseminated

46
00:02:14,458 --> 00:02:15,750
to the public at large.

47
00:02:15,833 --> 00:02:18,250
Without fail, every one
of Sho's victims

48
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:20,458
has been found crucified.

49
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:23,750
Thus, having found her
in such a unique state,

50
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:27,041
it's only natural to assume
that Fujisaki was slain

51
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:28,500
by the selfsame villain.

52
00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:30,083
To wit...

53
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:32,791
we have an incredibly violent
serial killer within our ranks?

54
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:33,666
Indeed.

55
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,291
And she goes by the name...

56
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:36,875
Touko Fukawa!

57
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:38,541
Wha-?! I--! Uh...!

58
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:39,875
Hey, wait just a second!

59
00:02:39,958 --> 00:02:42,083
Fukawa freaks out
at the sight of blood,

60
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:45,583
and whoever's been killing
those folks is not squeamish!

61
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:49,250
I think it would be fair to say
she's a "Sho", and a "no-Sho."

62
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:50,625

[NAEGI] Yeah!
That's gotta be it!

Listen to this:

They think Sho's suffering from

70
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,583
"dissociative
identity disorder."

71

Face it. Sho has a very
specific modus operandi,

00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:30,041
It said so in the
cops' secret file!

159
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:32,958
Wasn't that why we thought
it was the real Genocider Sho,

160
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:35,083
and not some copycat?

161
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:36,625
Hold up a second...

162
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:39,416
There is one other person
who knew that detail...

163
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,208
Togami.

164
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:42,833
[ALL gasp]

165
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:45,458
[NAEGI] When we looked at that
file together in the library,

166
00:06:45,541 --> 00:06:47,333
didn't you say:

167
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:49,541
[TOGAMI] I assure you,
these are genuine.

168
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:52,583
They match the copies
in my study at home.

169
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:53,916
[NAEGI] Frankly...

170
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,208
I wouldn't be surprised
if you knew Sho's methods

171
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:58,500
before we even got here.

172
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:01,166
S-So we're locked in here
with a serial killer

173
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:02,375
and a copycat?!

174
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:04,583
You were privy to
Fukawa's secret,

175
00:07:04,666 --> 00:07:06,791
and hoped to pin your crime
to her other persona.

176
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:08,500
What have you to say
for yourself?!

177
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:10,208
Answer us!

178
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:12,541
I say, where's
your evidence?

179
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:14,666
You're not off
the hook just yet.

180
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:17,500
The extension cord used
to crucify Fujisaki

181
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:18,958
was not unknown to me.

182
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:21,166
I noticed its
presence in the library,

183
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:24,500
where you spent a fair amount
of time prior to the murder.

184
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:27,875
[TOGAMI] That's your proof?

185
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:31,166
So I killed Fujisaki in
the girls' locker room,

186
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:34,041
and then strung her up so
as to emulate the victims

187
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:36,666
of a known murderer,
throwing suspicion elsewhere

188
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,041
and covering my tracks.

189
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:39,375
Does that sum it up?

190
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:40,958
[NAEGI] We've got
him on the ropes,

191
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:42,875
so why is he so calm?

192
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:44,375
[NAEGI gasps]

193
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:45,875
[NAEGI] Wait!

194
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:49,375
Was the crime really committed
in the girls' locker room?

195
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:50,625
[OHGAMI] Huh...

196
00:07:50,708 --> 00:07:52,625
After I was done with
my workout last night,

197
00:07:52,708 --> 00:07:54,833
I spilled my protein
coffee on this rug,

198
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:57,375
but now there's no sign
of the stain that it left.

199
00:07:59,416 --> 00:08:00,916
[NAEGI] Huh?

200
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,458
[NAEGI] I gotta wonder...

201
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:05,291
What if the killer switched the
contents of the locker rooms

202
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,958
to throw us off the trail?

203
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:08,750
[YAMADA]
Great Caesar's ghost!

204
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:09,750
[OHGAMI] So...

205
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:12,125
Togami swapped out
the rooms, then?

206
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:14,041
[NAEGI] There was a
swimsuit model poster

207
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:15,708
in the girls' locker room...

208
00:08:15,791 --> 00:08:19,000
And a poster of some
boy-band over on our side.

209
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:20,500
[HAGAKURE] Man, it's backwards!

210
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,041
[NAEGI] You're right...
Which means...

211
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:24,958
Fujisaki wasn't killed in the
girls' locker room,

212
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:26,250
but in our locker room!

213
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:27,958
It's the only way it works!

214
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:29,333
What do you mean?!

215
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:31,166
[HAGAKURE] Wait...
So how did that chick get into

216
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,333
our locker room
in the first place?

217
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:36,333
Quite simple, actually.

218
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:37,750
Our Fujisaki...

219
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:38,791
was a boy.

220
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:39,458
[TOGAMI gasps]

221
00:08:39,541 --> 00:08:41,291
[ALL gasp]

222
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:43,875
[KIRIGIRI] I found out
when I checked the body.

223
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:45,125
[MONOKUMA] Righty-o!

224
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:48,291
Little Miss Fujisaki...
was a dude in a dress!

225
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:50,458
So, he was
cross-dressing, huh?

226
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:51,625
Oh, that's so hot...

227
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:53,916
I wish I HAD killed him.

228
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,375
[HAGAKURE] Yeah, but...

229
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:57,333
that doesn't really change
the fact that Togami did it.

230
00:08:57,416 --> 00:09:00,291
[NAEGI] Actually,
I think it does.

231
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:02,041
What prompted the
change of heart?

232
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:03,458
Because...

233
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:06,583
when we found out a second ago
that Fujisaki was a guy,

234
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:09,416
you were as surprised
as all the rest of us.

235
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,791
But the real killer
already knew.

236
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:15,833
Therefore, you
can't be our culprit!

237
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:18,500
Hah. I guess that works.

238
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:21,375
Your evidence is purely
circumstantial,

239
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:23,000
but it clears my name.

240
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:25,500
As theories go, it'll do.

241
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:27,708
It's exactly as Naegi claims!

242
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:29,583
I'm not the guilty party!

243
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:31,833
[gasping]

244
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:34,583
That said, I found her
in the locker room

245
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:36,708
and did tamper with
the state of the body.

246
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:38,458
You smug bastard!

247
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:40,375
You get off on this, huh?!

248
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:42,791
I was testing your
powers of deduction

249
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:45,500
and unnerving the killer
with this late revelation.

250
00:09:45,583 --> 00:09:47,500
[ISHIMARU] You...
you're still lying to us!

251
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:50,166
You're well within your
rights not to believe me.

252
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:53,041
But don't forget what happens
if you convict in error.

253
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:55,583
If you wish to see tomorrow,
help me find the killer.

254
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:57,541
--Squirrelly son of a--!
--So be it...

255
00:09:57,625 --> 00:09:59,333
Let's speak of the case further.

256
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:00,666
Excellent!

257
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:03,250
Our little guessing game's
found its second wind.

258
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:05,833
[CELESTIA] Tell me something...

259
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:10,250
How, pray tell, was the culprit
able to enter both locker rooms

260
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:12,208
without being
shot to pieces?

261
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:14,458
Easily. I found
the digital notebooks

262
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:16,250
of the deceased
students in the foyer.

263
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:18,375
Huh? What are you getting at?

264
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:19,958
[CELESTIA] If I'm
not mistaken,

265
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:21,958
it means either gender
could use them

266
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:24,083
and gain access to both rooms.

267
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:27,000
[KIRIGIRI] No... Kuwata's
digital notebook was broken.

268
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:28,500
It's useless.

269
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:30,750
[ASAHINA] So in other words,
the killer has to be a guy?

270
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:33,583
[CELESTIA] Yes, but isn't using
another student's device

271
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:35,583
in direct violation
of the school rules?

272
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:37,708
[TOGAMI] The rule in question
prohibits the lending

273
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:39,166
of our digital notebooks.

274
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:41,416
It says nothing
about taking them.

275
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,541
[MONOKUMA] Yup!
Trust Fund called it!

276
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:47,041
So all we really know about
Fujisaki's killer right now

277
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:48,958
is that he's of the
male persuasion?

278
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:50,750
[NAEGI] What am I not seeing?

279
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:54,458
There's gotta be
something, right?

280
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:56,166
Celestia, didn't you say...

281
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:58,666
that you saw Fujisaki
on the night he died?

282
00:10:58,750 --> 00:10:59,500
Indeed...

283
00:10:59,583 --> 00:11:01,208
He was headed somewhere

284
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:04,583
and had a long-sleeve jersey
stuffed into a duffel bag.

285
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:07,375
Alas, we found no such
shirt at the crime scene.

286
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:10,208
The killer must have
disposed of it earlier on.

287
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:13,333
But did he leave behind
any clues as to its fate?

288
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:15,125
[OHGAMI] If I
remember correctly,

289
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:17,458
we have a lot of jerseys
at our disposal.

290
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:19,583
[ASAHINA] Yeah, and a bunch
of different colors, right?

291
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:20,958
[YAMADA chuckles]

292
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:22,791
I don't even have a jersey.
They don't fit me right.

293
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:24,916
Yeah! Mine's white!
Looks pretty bitchin'.

294
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,791
You said Fujisaki was on
his way to meet with someone,

295
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:29,458
didn't you?
So, what if they

296
00:11:29,541 --> 00:11:30,750
picked out their
jerseys together?

297
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:32,333
Yes! That's it!

298
00:11:32,416 --> 00:11:35,666
Fujisaki's jersey must
match that of his killer!

299
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,375
You're saying,
whoever killed him

300
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:39,416
has to have a matching
blue jersey, huh?

[NAEGI gasps]

303
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:43,125
[OHWADA] Well, looks like
I'm off the hook, at least.

304
00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:44,541
I grabbed me a black one.

305
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:46,208
Shoulda kept your
mouth shut!

306

What the hell, bro?

00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:50,541
You trying to start somethin'?

308
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:52,500
Looks like Naegi
caught it, also.

309
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:54,958
Ohwada, you just
made a fatal blunder.

310
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:55,958
Mm-hmm...

311
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:57,458
The jersey...

312
00:11:57,541 --> 00:11:59,750
We talked about
him having one, but...

313
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:01,583
we never said it was blue.

315
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:04,375
Think about it, man:

316
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:07,083
Celestia never even
mentioned the color.

317
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:11,333
What're you
gettin' at, bro?!

318
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:22,250
[KIRIGIRI] It seems you've
dug your own grave, Ohwada.

319
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:23,625
I didn't dig nothing!

320
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:25,916
You poor sap,
I'm afraid you did.

321
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,083
The logic of your
feint was very sound.

322
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:30,666
You gave him just enough
rope to hang himself.

323
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:31,916
So to speak.

324
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,166
No, you're wrong!

325
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,750
My friend Mondo would
never stoop to homicide!

326
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:38,250
[ISHIMARU] Tell them
how wrong they are!

327
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:41,208
This is all a mistake!
It has to be!

328
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:43,791
I don't know how you guessed
that the shirt was blue,

329
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:46,208
but that doesn't mean
you murdered Fujisaki!

330
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:47,625
It's not true!

331
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:51,125
He's innocent! Why are you
all trying to frame him?!

332
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:52,791
[NAEGI] We have to be sure.

333
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:56,583
Let's look at the case again,
starting from the beginning.

334
00:12:56,666 --> 00:13:01,291
This will prove whether
our verdict is right or wrong!

335
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:04,458
[NAEGI] It was nighttime...

336
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:07,916
Fujisaki left the storage
room, duffel bag in tow.

337
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,916
There was a blue jersey
inside that bag.

338
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,583
Fujisaki headed off for
the boys' locker room.

339
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:16,833
But how was her digital notebook
able to get her inside?

340
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:17,916
Turns out...

341
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Fujisaki was actually a boy.

342
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:23,958
Someone was in the locker
room, waiting for him.

343
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:25,916
Whoever Fujisaki met up with

344
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,791
is the very person
who killed him.

345
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:29,583
He grabbed whatever was handy,

346
00:13:29,666 --> 00:13:30,791
in this case a dumbbell,

347
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:32,333
and attacked.

348
00:13:32,416 --> 00:13:35,416
Once the deed was done,
he needed to confuse us,

349
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:38,583
so he flip-flopped the contents
of the two locker rooms.

350
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:40,500
To get into the
girls' locker room,

351
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:43,666
he just needed to grab Maizono's
or Enoshima's notebook,

352
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,708
which were in the foyer.

353
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:49,500
That's how the killer managed
to swap out the two rooms.

354
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:52,666
I get it about right...

355
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,791
Mondo Ohwada?!

356
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:59,750
You're a clever guy, Naegi.

357
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:01,375
You got me...

358
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:03,250
Yeah, I did it.

359
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:04,875
[gasping]

360
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:06,291
[ISHIMARU] Mondo...

361
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:08,583
What are you saying...?

362
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:10,083
[OHWADA] Hey, Monokuma...

363
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:11,833
enough dickin' around...

364
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:14,250
Just let them cast
their damn votes already.

365
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:15,375
[MONOKUMA] With pleasure!

366
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:16,458
[ISHIMARU] No, wait!

367
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:18,041
Please, don't do this!

368
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:20,375
[MONOKUMA] Gimme a
break-- He confessed!

369
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:22,541
All right, twerps,
you know the drill!

370
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:23,916
Place your vote

371
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,083
--and save your necks!
--[ISHIMARU] Please, noooo!

372
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:36,250
[machine whistles]

373
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:39,125
[MONOKUMA] Votes are in!

374
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:40,333
Shock-eroo!

375
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:43,000
Ohwada in the locker room
with a dumbbell!

376
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:45,083
Eat'cher heart out,
Colonel Mustard!

377
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:48,041
Believe it or not, my ragtag
bunch of character tropes,

378
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:49,791
the vote wasn't unanimous!

379
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:54,500
Ishimaru, voting yourself
guilty was noble, but stupid.

380
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:56,500
Good thing the others
had their act together,

381
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:57,916
or you'd all be boned.

382
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,041
[ISHIMARU] I don't believe it...

383
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:02,333
I refuse to believe he's...

384
00:15:02,416 --> 00:15:03,750
a killer...

385
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:05,333
Sorry, bro...

386
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:07,791
Why?! Why are you apologizing?!

387
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:09,375
Why did you murder him, Mondo?!

388
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:12,375
Why?! Tell me!
Make me understand!

389
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:15,333
Why'd you do something
so horrible?!

390
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:17,750
[MONOKUMA] Poor guy...

391
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:20,416
Must be something too
traumatic to talk about.

392
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,416
Guess I'll have to
spill the beans for him!

393
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:26,500
A long time ago, in a
galaxy far, far away,

394
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:28,916
there lived a boy
named Chihiro Fujisaki.

395
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,458
Pretty much from day one,

396
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:32,666
Fujisaki was way too
girly for his own good.

397
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,541
I mean, look at those eyes!

398
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:38,166
Bro-ay was seriously moe!

399
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:40,958
After years of being told
he was the girliest girl

400
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:42,208
who ever girled,

401
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:44,416
Fujisaki had had enough
of everyone's crap.

402
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,583
Rather than punch everyone
in the mouth, though,

403
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:49,083
he dealt with the constant
oppression in another way.

404
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:50,333
A gentler way.

405
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:52,791
A way that involved tucking!

406
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:56,125
He decided to live life as
a girl, ladies and gents!

407
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:59,833
Sure, he kinda sucked at
being a boy, but man alive,

408
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:02,458
did he ever knock it outta
the park at being a chick!

409
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:05,541
He enjoyed his new life,
but the truth was a secret

410
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:07,500
he couldn't afford
to ever let loose.

411
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:10,375
If word got out, the
teasing from you schmucks

412
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:11,791
was bound to be ten times worse

413
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:15,125
than anything he'd ever
gotten back in the day.

414
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:17,750
I figured he'd grow a pair
and kill one of you.

415
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:21,166
Instead, he had the gall to use
the threat of exposure

416
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:23,875
as a catalyst for positive
self-improvement!

417
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:26,291
What a let-down, am I right?!

418
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:27,708
[FUJISAKI] Now's the time...

419
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:29,708
I can't hide anymore...

420
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:33,000
For better or for worse,
I need to get stronger

421
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:34,416
and be the real me!

422
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,125
[MONOKUMA] Our hero decided he'd
start hitting the iron

423
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:39,333
with testosterone-fueled gusto.

424
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:41,125
But the question remained:

425
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:44,375
Whoever to choose
as his man-mentor?

426
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:45,000
Hmmm...

427
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:46,333
Yeah, me.

428
00:16:46,416 --> 00:16:49,458
Fujisaki trusted me enough
to tell me the truth.

429
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:51,041
[MONOKUMA] Bikers are rather
known for that

430
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:52,791
"my word is my bond" spiel.

431
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:56,416
And on top of that, Ohwada
here is a manly specimen,

432
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,708
once you get past the
blundered bouffant.

433
00:16:58,791 --> 00:17:01,916
He was a goal for Fujisaki
to strive towards.

434
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,208
I feel like I'm on a roll here
with all this juicy exposition.

435
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:07,625
Let's traipse down
Memory Lane some more.

436
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:10,791
This time, we'll check out
Ohwada's big bad secret,

437
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:14,416
y'know, the one he max-repped
Fujisaki to keep hidden?

438
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,375
Check it out!

439
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:17,583
He killed his own brother!

440
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:19,041
[ALL gasp]

441
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:23,208
[OHWADA whimpers]

442
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:25,750
[OHWADA] My big bro
was like a god to me.

443
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:28,791
He created the best damn
biker gang in all of Japan.

444
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:31,666
So, of course I joined up.

445
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:35,458
My bro was top dog,
and I was his number two.

446
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:37,458
When it came time for him to
hang up his colors,

447
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:40,083
I was supposed to take
his place as the boss.

448
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:42,666
But I wasn't him, y'know?
Not even close...

449
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:47,041
I felt like such a failure
next to him, such a... fake!

450
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:49,458
On the night of his
retirement party,

451
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:53,166
I challenged him
to a street-race.

452
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:54,708
I was so
desperate to win

453
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:57,416
that I started pulling some
really reckless shit.

454
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,708
And that's when--!

455
00:17:58,791 --> 00:18:00,750

[OHWADA screams]

[OHWADA] He died that night,
saving my stupid ass...

the gang go to hell, Mondo...

00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:16,125
Promise me... as a man...

462
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:18,750
[OHWADA] I'm such a weakling!

463
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:22,958
I'm pathetic! I couldn't
man up to my own failings!

464
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:23,750
[OHWADA sobs]

465
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:25,541
[OHWADA] But Fujisaki...

466
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:27,083
[FUJISAKI] I wanna change!

467
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:29,500
It's time for me
to become a man!

468
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:32,333
[OHWADA] This little dude
with so much to lose...

469
00:18:32,416 --> 00:18:35,625
he had the balls to face
his fears and beat 'em!

470
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:37,958
I was jealous
of him, all right?

471
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:41,041
I was so... friggin' jealous!

472
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:42,625
'Cause he was stronger!

473
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:47,625
[OHWADA] You little...
bastard...

474
00:18:47,708 --> 00:18:49,583
So, you wanna be a man?

475
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:50,958
Step right up...

476
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:53,958
It's your lucky day, for real...

477
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:56,250
I'm the strongest guy
here by a country mile,

478
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:59,541
and if anyone says otherwise,
I'll beat 'em to a bloody pulp!

479
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:01,208
I'm stronger than you!

480
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:04,666
And I'm stronger
than Big Bro!

481
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:07,125
[OHWADA yells,
blow hits]

482
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:10,208
[OHWADA]
I crushed his head in...

483
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:13,333
because he was brave...

484
00:19:13,416 --> 00:19:16,125
I killed someone who
came to me for help,

485
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:18,166
someone who looked up to me!

486
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:21,000
He was more man
than I've ever been!

487
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:24,000
[KIRIGIRI] And then,
after you killed Fujisaki,

488
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:26,750
you broke his digital
notebook to hide his secret.

489
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:28,583
Isn't that so?

490
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:30,833
The other notebook
I found in the foyer,

491
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:33,166
the one that I assumed
belonged to Kuwata

492
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:35,291
was yours, I guess.

493
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:37,208
You took it into the sauna,

494
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:40,375
hoping the heat and
steam would ruin it.

495
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:43,416
You probably did the
same thing to Fujisaki's.

496
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,500
That would explain
why we weren't able

497
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:47,166
to track his notebook down.

498
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:50,291
You broke it before
disposing of it.

499
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:54,250
[OHWADA sobs]

500
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:57,125
[ISHIMARU sobs]

501
00:19:57,208 --> 00:19:59,875
[NAEGI whimpers]

502
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:03,500
[sobbing]

503
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:05,083
[MONOKUMA] Boo-hoo-hoo.

504
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:08,375
As much as I love watching men
weep like damsels in distress,

505
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:10,500
it's Punishment Time!

506
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:11,750
[ISHIMARU gasps]

507
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:13,083
[MONOKUMA] Don't look at
me like I'm singling out

508
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:14,458
Pompadour Jr. here!

509
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:16,916
This punishment is
meant for all humanity!

510
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,708
Despair is your birthright!

511
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:21,375
And what does that mean?

512
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:22,875
[MONOKUMA] Huh? What's it mean?

513
00:20:22,958 --> 00:20:24,666
It's gibberish, okay?!

514
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,666
It was the first damn
thing that came to mind!

515
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,958
What? You think I'm
goin' for a Pulitzer?!

516
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:29,833
Hmph.

517
00:20:29,916 --> 00:20:31,541
I am going to survive this...

518
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:33,791
That's all the rest
of you need to know.

519
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:35,333
[MONOKUMA laughs]

520
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:37,250
[MONOKUMA]
You're a hoot, Richie Rich!

521
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:38,875
I like the cut of your jib!

522
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:42,875
Just so that we're crystal
clear on this, Monokuma,

523
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:45,208
The moment I'm
declared the winner,

524
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:47,666
I'm going to find a way
to end you, little demon!

525
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,541
I swear on my good name!

526
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:51,083
[MONOKUMA laughs]

527
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:53,166
[MONOKUMA] Warning!
Bad-ass alert!

528
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:55,625
Look at you, with your
sweeping proclamations!

529
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:57,916
Aw, the bit part
thinks he's people!

530
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,416
That's so cute!

531
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,166
[TOGAMI] Who're you
calling a bit part?!

532
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:02,291
[MONOKUMA] Now, then...

533
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:04,125
it's time for you-know-what!

534
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:05,666
No! Not yet!

535
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:07,750
[MONOKUMA] I've prepped a li'l
special somethin'-somethin'

536
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:09,708
for our Super
High School-Level Biker.

537
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:12,458
Spoiler: I think
he's gonna dig it!

538
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:13,625
Whaddya say, Ohwada?!

539
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:15,708
Gimme five, Bro-seph!

540
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:18,416
Get ready for hell on wheels!

541
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,500
Don't do this! Take me instead!

542
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:22,666
[MONOKUMA] Well, let's
send him off with a bang!

543
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:26,416
Punishment Time, ahoy!

544
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:29,666
I'm begging you not
to kill my friend!

545
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:32,125
I hope you'll
forgive me, Big Bro.

546
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:33,625
I promised you man-to-man,

547
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:36,041
but I let you down...

548
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:40,000
[ISHIMARU screams]

549
00:23:17,958 --> 00:23:21,833
[MONOKUMA] Try not to mourn your
lost pal too deeply, Ishimaru.

550
00:23:21,916 --> 00:23:25,291
I'm sure his soul's gone
on to a "butter" place.

551
00:23:25,375 --> 00:23:30,083
[ISHIMARU sobs]

552
00:23:30,166 --> 00:23:32,666
[NAEGI] People's lives
are worth nothing to him.

553
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:33,916
Less than nothing!

554
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,458
[ASAHINA whimpers]

555
00:23:35,541 --> 00:23:38,375
[NAEGI] I dunno how much of this
I can take-- I really don't.

556
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:42,125
And now listening to Ishimaru's
heart-wrenching screams,

557
00:23:42,208 --> 00:23:46,708
I realize how
powerless we all are.

558
00:23:46,791 --> 00:23:50,833
[ISHIMARU wails]

559
00:23:51,916 --> 00:23:53,041
[MONOKUMA] Not gonna lie,

560
00:23:53,125 --> 00:23:54,958
I think we've got a
good pace going on here.

561
00:23:55,041 --> 00:23:56,375
You feel me?

562
00:23:56,458 --> 00:23:59,083
Yeah, we're hitting our
milestones, so that's a relief.

563
00:23:59,166 --> 00:24:01,333
That Maizono girl had gumption,

564
00:24:01,416 --> 00:24:02,958
trying to pull off
that first murder

565
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:05,916
before the group got all bogged
down by ethics and junk.

566
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,291
Too bad she's worm-food!

567
00:24:08,375 --> 00:24:09,833
The only thing
that bums me out

568
00:24:09,916 --> 00:24:12,208
is I went to all that
effort to plant a spy

569
00:24:12,291 --> 00:24:14,375
amongst the giblets,
and you haven't had to

570
00:24:14,458 --> 00:24:16,500
lift a bloody finger yet!

571
00:24:17,833 --> 00:24:20,250
[MONOKUMA] What? You
have a question for me?

572
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:21,750
Fire away!

573
00:24:21,833 --> 00:24:25,791
So long as it's not my bust
size, I'll tell ya anything!

574
00:24:25,875 --> 00:24:29,666
Huh? Who's the 16th
student at Hope's Peak?

575
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:30,375
Sorry!

576
00:24:30,458 --> 00:24:32,083
That's classified, too!

577
00:24:32,166 --> 00:24:34,125
[MONOKUMA laughs]
