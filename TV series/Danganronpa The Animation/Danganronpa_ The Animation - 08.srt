[MONOKUMA laughs]

3
00:00:26,416 --> 00:00:27,958
[MONOKUMA] What's with
the sudden attitude?

4
00:00:28,041 --> 00:00:30,416
Are you forgetting
I call the shots here?

5
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,000
We had ourselves a deal, chica!

6
00:00:33,083 --> 00:00:35,250
I've made my decision...

7
00:00:35,333 --> 00:00:36,791
This is over...

8
00:00:36,875 --> 00:00:38,125
I'm sick of it...

9
00:00:38,208 --> 00:00:40,291
And I'm sick of you...

10
00:00:40,375 --> 00:00:43,041
That's why you're going down.

11
00:00:43,125 --> 00:00:44,375
[MONOKUMA] Fair enough...

12
00:00:44,458 --> 00:00:46,750
"Bear" in mind though,
if anything happens to me,

13
00:00:46,833 --> 00:00:49,625
my hostages get
turned into skirt steak.

14

[OHGAMI growls]

15
00:00:50,875 --> 00:00:53,125
[NAEGI] Wait... hostages...?

16
00:00:53,208 --> 00:00:55,500
And what does he mean deal?

17
00:00:55,583 --> 00:00:56,583
Does this mean...

18
00:00:56,666 --> 00:00:58,250
Ohgami is the mole?!

19
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:23,750
[NAEGI] Three trials
into our "education,"

20
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:26,541
Monokuma unlocked the
school's fourth floor.

21
00:02:26,625 --> 00:02:29,666
So, like always,
we scoped it out.

22
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,833
Jeez, would it have
killed Togami and Fukawa

23
00:02:31,916 --> 00:02:34,291
to join us while we
look around up here?

24
00:02:36,458 --> 00:02:37,958
Is there a problem, Naegi?

25
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:41,333
No! Heh. Everything's
just fine!

26
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:48,666
[NAEGI] The new floor
included the teachers' lounge,

27
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,708
and the chemistry lab...

28
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:52,125
[ASAHINA] Check it out!

29
00:02:52,208 --> 00:02:53,291
Prodolumen X!

30
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:55,333
It's like god-tier protein!

31
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:56,458
Not over here...

32
00:02:56,541 --> 00:02:57,875
Y'see this bottle?

33
00:02:57,958 --> 00:03:00,375
It's a lethal poison.

34
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:02,458
[NAEGI] ...along
with the music room...

35
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:05,708
[NAEGI] ...the computer lab...

36
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:09,833
Wonder why it's locked?

37
00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:12,250
[NAEGI] ...and the
principal's office.

38
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:13,958
[NAEGI] It's locked, too.

39
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:15,583
[KIRIGIRI] Naegi.

40
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:17,208
[NAEGI] Kiri, hey!

41
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:19,166
Do you have a moment?

42
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:22,416
I trust you found...
what I told you about?

43
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,541
[NAEGI] Uh... Yeah...

44
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:27,041
Thing is, soon as I
started to look around,

45
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:29,458
someone knocked me out.

46
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:32,583
By the time I woke up,
they had taken everything.

47
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:34,041
Damn...

48
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:36,333
[NAEGI] Oh, right...

49
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:37,750
I almost forgot...

50
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:39,833
I found this
really weird note.

51
00:03:39,916 --> 00:03:42,791
How about we save that
topic for another time?

52
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:44,250
Huh?

53
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:49,875
[KIRIGIRI] Tell me the truth...

54
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:53,875
Are you... keeping
secrets from me?

55
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:55,583
Uh, why do you ask?

56
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:59,666
[NAEGI] Yeah, it looks
like Ohgami's a mole...

57
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,000
But...

58
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:05,208
I can't spread that around
'til I know for sure...

59
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:07,916
I'm sorry. I am.

60
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,416
You're the one who said we
should pool our knowledge!

61
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,708
What happened to doing
this as friends, Naegi?

62
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:16,291
[KIRIGIRI] Forget it...

63
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:20,083
Sorry...

64
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:27,291
[HAGAKURE sighs]

65
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:29,875
That floor gave us
a whole lotta nothin'.

66
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:31,375
[KIRIGIRI] Patience.

67
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:33,791
There may still be some leads
in the principal's office.

68
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:36,458
Or perhaps lurking
in the computer lab.

69
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:39,125
If only we could get in.

70
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:40,958
Hey yo, Hercu-Lady!

71
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:42,500
You wanna do us a solid

72
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:44,708
and break down
those doors, maybe?

73
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:48,125
[MONOKUMA]
Nice try, Brat Brigade!

74
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:49,500
So that's the plan?

75
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:52,041
Bust into my
sanctum sanctorum?!

76

so gosh-darn violent!

77
00:04:56,375 --> 00:05:00,166
Not to harsh your mellow by
movin' the goalposts, but...

[digital notebooks chime]

79
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:07,083
[NAEGI] He just tacked
on a new rule for us.

80
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:08,333
[MONOKUMA laughs]

81

I know I'll sleep easier!

Ta-ta!

00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:15,000
He sure added that one
in a hurry, didn't he?

84
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:18,333
I mean, one of those rooms
must be hiding something

85
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:20,375
or why would he even bother?

86
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:24,250
Wait! Of course!

87
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:26,541
We're not dead in the
water yet, you guys!

88
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:27,708
We're not?

00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:30,208
We've still got a
friend in cyberspace!

[ALTER EGO]
You came to see me! Great!

00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:38,125
I just bypassed the

Well...

94
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:46,416
it seems as though the
school was in the process

95
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,750
of enacting a certain
plan when it shut down.

96
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:52,666
[ALTER EGO] It involved
the isolation of students

97
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,958
within the Hope's Peak
High School campus

98
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:57,708
who are then never allowed
off school grounds.

99
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:01,833
That's not even the most
shocking aspect of the plan.

100
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:03,208
In some cases,

101
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:05,708
they'd be forced to live out
their entire lives here.

102
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:06,500
Wait...

103
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:07,916
That sounds like...

104
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,125
[OHGAMI] ...the very thing
we're being subjected to.

105
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:13,625
[ALTER EGO] And this wasn't
some idea dictated to them

106
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:14,625
from outside...

107
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,750
The school itself
came up with it.

108
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:18,541
But to what end?

109
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:19,875
[ALTER EGO]
The plan was created

110
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:22,916
because of something that
happened one year ago:

111
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,916

despair-inducing incident

00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:33,666
Because of what happened...

116
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:36,833
Hope's Peak High was forced
to shut its doors forever.

117
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:39,791
The isolation plan
was put into effect.

118
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:41,416
The architect of the plan

119
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,166
was none other than...

120
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:44,375
the principal.

121
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:45,958
[ALL gasp]

122
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:47,083
I've learned...

123
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:49,125
that he's a man in
his late thirties...

124
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:52,416
And the odds of him still
being on-campus are rather high.

125
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,625
So he's the brains
behind the bear!

126
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:56,458
We gotta track this guy down!

127
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,916
I'll find the principal...

128
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,500
I have to be the one.

129
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:02,916
And then...

130
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,291
I'll make him answer for this...

131
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:07,208

I saw the two of 'em earlier...

Ohgami was attacking Monokuma,
and not pulling any punches.

But then he mentioned
something about hostages,

You witnessed all of that?

because hostages

[OHGAMI growls]

328
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:45,125
To think Asahina...

329
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:48,916
was hurt because of my
treacherous deeds...

330
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,541
This degree of villainy...

331
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:53,666
is unacceptaaaaaable!

[OHGAMI growls]

No longer!

337
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:03,250
I will not allow
this to continuuue!

338
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:04,916
[NAEGI] Just calm down! Ohgami!

[ASAHINA] Sakura!

[KIRIGIRI] Is there a problem?

[NAEGI] Kiri! Help us!

342
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,791
We have to hold her back!

343
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:17,208
[OHGAMI] That won't
be necessary.

344
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:18,833
I'm not going to hurt her.

345
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:23,416
I'll tell her to just
leave Asahina out of this.

346
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,708
No, wait! Come back!

347
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:31,208
[KIRIGIRI sighs]

348
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:34,708
So, uh...

349
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:36,375
are you still angry?

350
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:39,875
Take that as a yes...

351
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:40,833
'Cause, um...

352
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:42,916
I've earned it...

00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,375
I'm not.

354
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:47,708
That thing you were
keeping from me...

355
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:50,458
it was the truth
about Ohgami, wasn't it?

356
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:53,708
You didn't want to drop that
bombshell on us without proof,

357
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:55,166
so you waited.

358
00:15:56,791 --> 00:15:58,416
I see your logic.

359
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,666
But your discretion
is still insulting.

360
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:01,750
[NAEGI] Huh?

361
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:04,041
At heart, doesn't
it just go to show

362
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:06,375
you're not entirely
sure I can be trusted?

363
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:07,333
I...

364
00:16:07,416 --> 00:16:08,958
guess it does...

365
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:09,958
Sorry...

366
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:11,041
[KIRIGIRI] No need...

Water under the
bridge at this point.

Besides...

369
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:16,875
There's a chance I might've...

370
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:19,583
"overreacted" a bit.

371
00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:21,041
Well, yes.

372
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:25,000
Enough about that. I'm here
because Fujisaki's avatar

373
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:27,541
would like a word with us.

You came to
visit me, great!

375
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:31,291
Can't imagine he'd
ask us down here

376
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:32,875
unless it was something big.

377
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:37,000
[ALTER EGO] Well...

378
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:38,625
I'd like you to take
this laptop somewhere

379
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:41,208
that I can interface with
the school's network.

380
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:44,875
'Cause I...

381
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:47,875
I don't want
anybody else to die!

help you get out of here.

[NAEGI gasps]

384
00:16:51,916 --> 00:16:53,083
But I can't...

385
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:55,458
Not while I'm stuck on
this puny hard drive.

386
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:58,625
Without network access,
I can't help you at all!

387
00:16:58,708 --> 00:17:01,166
[NAEGI] Huh... Seems risky...

388
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:06,333
I'm aware of the
dangers involved.

389
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:07,750
Even so...

390
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:10,083
I want to do my part!

391
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:11,666
I'll be fine!

392
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:15,375
Whenever I think of how brave
you've been, I feel brave, too!

393
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:18,083
I guess that's a silly
thing for an AI to say,

394
00:17:18,166 --> 00:17:19,500
but I really do mean it!

395
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:20,958
It's 'cause of you!

396
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,000
So be it.

Let's get him hooked up
to the school's network.

398
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:28,083
But... what if he...?

399
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:31,458
I want to honor
the choice he's made.

400
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:33,083
Yeah, you're right...

401
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:35,041
If we're smart about this...

402
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:36,166
and get lucky...

403
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:39,000
maybe our foe won't
even notice him.

404
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:40,833
That hidden chamber
beyond the bathroom

405
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:43,791
has no surveillance
cameras in it.

406
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:47,083
And I remember there being
a network access port.

407
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:48,458
However...

408
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:51,166
we have no clue how close of
an eye he's been keeping

on the system.

410
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,125
That said...

411
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:56,416
it's still a gamble
worth taking.

412
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,833
Yeah it is...

413
00:17:57,916 --> 00:17:59,958
And I'd like to be the one to
take him to the room,

414
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:01,416
if that's okay.

416
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:13,000

down some useful clues!

and hang tight!

So you...

423
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:41,583
think of me as a friend?

424
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:42,833
That means a lot!

425
00:18:42,916 --> 00:18:44,291
Thank you!

A Locked-Room Murder (lol)!

428
00:18:56,708 --> 00:18:58,416
I don't know if you
guys realized this,

429
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,041
but parentheses are
freakin' amaze-balls!

430
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:03,333
No matter what horrible thing
you put out there,

431
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:06,000
so long as you slap a
parenthetical "lol"

432
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:08,541
afterwards, it's all gravy!

433
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:09,791
Back on topic!

434
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:12,625
We got seven students
still alive and kickin'.

435
00:19:12,708 --> 00:19:14,541
Think it's gonna stay there?

436
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:17,000
Or are we heading
down to six?

437
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:23,666
[NAEGI] Everyone's handling
this differently...

438
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,041
[NAEGI] All I can do
is believe in them.

439
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:31,041
And hope they do
the right thing.

440
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:32,500
[KIRIGIRI] Naegi...!

441
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:40,916
[NAEGI] Did something happen?

442
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:41,666
[ASAHINA] It...

443
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,375
it's Sakura, she...

444
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:46,916
[NAEGI] What's she doing?!

445
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:49,666
[NAEGI] It's no good!

446
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:50,833
[NAEGI grunts]

447
00:19:50,916 --> 00:19:52,875
Ohgami! Open the door!

448
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:54,250
I tried that...

449
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:55,791
Why doesn't she answer?

450
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:57,041
Oh, man...

451
00:19:57,125 --> 00:19:59,541
Either the door has been
locked from the inside,

452
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:02,166
or something in there
is actively preventing

453
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:03,500
the knob from turning.

454
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:04,750
[ASAHINA] We have
to get in there!

455
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:06,458
Do something!

456
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:18,958
[NAEGI] Ohgami!

457
00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:21,333
[NAEGI gasps]

458
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:34,583
[MONOKUMA] And behind door
number one-- that's right,

459
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:36,666
a big beefy dead chick!

460
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,625
Scramble around
awhile for clues,

461
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:41,583
and then we'll get down
to the judge-mo-fyin'!

462
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:42,708
Not again...

463
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:45,375
Sadly... this was inevitable.

464
00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:46,583
[ASAHINA] Of course...

465
00:20:46,666 --> 00:20:48,250
They killed Sakura...

466
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:50,125
Of course they killed her.

467
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:51,541
I'm gonna...

468
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,708
I'm gonna get the others now...

469
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:55,833
[NAEGI] Asahina...

470
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:57,125
[ASAHINA] I'm fine...

471
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:58,625
Couldn't be better...

472
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:12,083
[KIRIGIRI] I see two separate
instances of head trauma.

473
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:17,000
[KIRIGIRI] Seems to
have vomited blood.

474
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:21,791
[KIRIGIRI] Powder spilled
on the top of her trainers.

475
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:26,708
That's pretty
amazing... seriously.

476
00:21:26,791 --> 00:21:29,750
Still freaks me out to
look at a body up close.

477
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:31,458
All I can figure is...

478
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:33,875
I must've worked with
corpses sometime before.

479
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:34,458
Huh?

480
00:21:34,541 --> 00:21:35,375
Nothing.

481
00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:37,000
Just thinking out loud.

482
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:38,541
Sorry.

483
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:41,958
The sole door to the crime scene
was barred from within.

484
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:47,208
It seems we have a locked-room
murder on our hands.

485
00:21:47,291 --> 00:21:49,708
A "locked-room" murder?

486
00:21:52,708 --> 00:21:55,375
[NAEGI] That door was
definitely jammed shut.

487
00:21:55,458 --> 00:21:57,250
So how did the
killer escape

488
00:21:57,333 --> 00:21:59,708
after they
barricaded the room?

489
00:22:03,166 --> 00:22:04,291
[HAGAKURE] Dude!

490
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:05,833
What if... she's fakin'...?!

491
00:22:05,916 --> 00:22:08,958
We-hell... Ain't
this a kick in the dick?

492
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:12,166
She's dead; you heard the
corpse announcement, didn't you?

493
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:14,166
[ASAHINA] Togami...

494
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:15,458
Hagakure...

495
00:22:15,541 --> 00:22:16,708
Fukawa...

496
00:22:16,791 --> 00:22:19,458
I know one of you
bastards did this...

497
00:22:19,541 --> 00:22:21,833
One of you killed Sakura Ohgami!

498
00:22:23,291 --> 00:22:24,583
Wait a sec...

499
00:22:24,666 --> 00:22:25,958
How do you know?

500
00:22:26,041 --> 00:22:27,708
She told me herself...

501
00:22:27,791 --> 00:22:31,166
she asked for the three of them
to come and meet her here!

502
00:22:32,541 --> 00:22:34,291
[NAEGI] Is that true?

503
00:22:34,375 --> 00:22:35,458
[ASAHINA] Those three...

504
00:22:35,541 --> 00:22:38,666
were the last people
to see her alive!

505
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:41,083
Whoever killed her,
I'm gonna make you pay!

506
00:22:42,166 --> 00:22:50,166
[MONOKUMA laughs]
