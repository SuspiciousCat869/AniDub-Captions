And besides, wherever

I will follow like a lamb!

[ENOSHIMA] What about you,
Miss Marple?

641
00:22:58,625 --> 00:23:01,291
Does the smartest gal in the
room have a death wish, too?

642
00:23:01,375 --> 00:23:03,375
Is the thought of all that
trouble daddy went through

643
00:23:03,458 --> 00:23:05,000
enough to keep
you in the game?

Or are you gonna drink
Naegi's "unkool-aid?"

[NAEGI] Don't listen to her!

Kiri, please...

647
00:23:11,208 --> 00:23:14,416
I know how important your
father was to you; believe me...

648

This is what he wanted.

You say that...

But how could we really
know what he wanted?

have that luxury...

[NAEGI] Read between
the lines...

654
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,583
He had a vision...

655
00:23:27,666 --> 00:23:29,208
He had hope for us all...

656
00:23:29,291 --> 00:23:31,250
He wanted us to have a future!

[KIRIGIRI gasps]

[NAEGI] If hope
really has left us...

659
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:38,041
Then in his name we have to do
whatever it takes

660
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:39,500
to get it back!

661
00:23:43,291 --> 00:23:44,791
That we do...

662
00:23:44,875 --> 00:23:45,958
You're right...

663
00:23:46,041 --> 00:23:48,041
My father did it all for us...

664
00:23:48,125 --> 00:23:49,375
For tomorrow...

665
00:23:49,458 --> 00:23:51,416
He sacrificed everything...

666
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:54,291
And decidedly not to have
his charges bend like reeds

667
00:23:54,375 --> 00:23:56,000
under a current of misery!

668
00:23:56,083 --> 00:23:57,291
Knew I could
count on you!

669
00:23:57,375 --> 00:23:59,333
Thanks for the
reality check, Naegi.

670
00:23:59,416 --> 00:24:01,375
I may not have ever
really known the man,

671
00:24:01,458 --> 00:24:03,708
but somehow or other
I feel close to him.

672
00:24:03,791 --> 00:24:06,000
Although, I suppose knowing
and understanding

673
00:24:06,083 --> 00:24:07,583
are not the same thing.

674
00:24:08,625 --> 00:24:11,375
[KIRIGIRI] Speaking of which...

675
00:24:11,458 --> 00:24:13,791
You may look at yourself
as a lightning rod...

676
00:24:13,875 --> 00:24:16,541
But I don't believe that's
a reflection of reality.

677
00:24:16,625 --> 00:24:19,500
I think you fill an
entirely different role.

678
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:21,791
You stay positive for us.

679
00:24:21,875 --> 00:24:24,083
Even when your luck
is at its lowest ebb,

680
00:24:24,166 --> 00:24:25,625
when all seems lost...

681
00:24:25,708 --> 00:24:27,666
You fight for hope.

682
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:31,000
When the rest of us would
give in, you persist.

683
00:24:31,083 --> 00:24:33,166
Lady Luck doesn't snub you.

684
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:34,625
She depends on you.

Looks like that's
all she wrote.

So much for Despair.

You are an imbecile.

00:30:15,541 --> 00:30:17,333
I suppose we have
to do this eventually.

800
00:30:25,208 --> 00:30:26,208
[FUKAWA (SHO) sneezes]

801
00:30:26,291 --> 00:30:27,791
[FUKAWA] Huh...? Uh...

802
00:30:27,875 --> 00:30:29,208
What the...? Oh...

803
00:30:29,291 --> 00:30:31,541
Weren't we just like, facing off
against the mastermind?

804
00:30:31,625 --> 00:30:33,125
It's okay. We won actually.

805
00:30:33,208 --> 00:30:35,291
So... we... can leave
this nightmare?

806
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:36,958
Mm-hmm! Of course,

807
00:30:37,041 --> 00:30:39,583
there's no telling what's
waiting for us out there.

808
00:30:39,666 --> 00:30:40,291
Well...

809
00:30:40,375 --> 00:30:41,833
Look at it like this:

810
00:30:41,916 --> 00:30:44,833
There are more possibilities
out there than there are here.

811
00:30:44,916 --> 00:30:47,541
Sure, there'll be
despair, but hey...

812
00:30:47,625 --> 00:30:48,416
Buck up!

813
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,916
Hope's waitin' patiently, too.

814
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,125
And if it's not, hell,
we'll bring our own.

815
00:30:55,208 --> 00:30:57,000
Not a bad way of
putting it...

816
00:30:57,083 --> 00:30:59,250
Not a bad way of
putting it at all.

817
00:30:59,333 --> 00:31:01,208
Thank you for
showing us the way.

818
00:31:01,291 --> 00:31:02,708
Mm-hmm!

819
00:31:02,791 --> 00:31:04,958
First thing I'm gonna do is
find a donut shop and binge!

820
00:31:05,041 --> 00:31:07,208
After that, life can hit
me with whatever it wants!

821
00:31:07,291 --> 00:31:08,875
That's your big plan
for out there?

822
00:31:08,958 --> 00:31:09,708
Donuts?

823
00:31:09,791 --> 00:31:11,333
Yeah, I can
make my own!

824
00:31:11,416 --> 00:31:12,875
That'd be awesome!

825
00:31:12,958 --> 00:31:14,333
Unless there's no flour...

826
00:31:14,416 --> 00:31:16,125
Then I'll jus' start
plantin' wheat!

827
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:18,500
Let's go. We're not
getting any younger.

828
00:31:18,583 --> 00:31:20,875
And I gotta say, Naegi,
with you leading the charge,

829
00:31:20,958 --> 00:31:23,458
I'm excited about our prospects.

830
00:31:23,541 --> 00:31:26,416
For the first time in a long
time, the sky's the limit.

831
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:28,958
Thank you, Kiri.

832
00:31:29,041 --> 00:31:31,291
[NAEGI] With me leading
the charge, huh?

833
00:31:31,375 --> 00:31:32,708
That's a good one...

834
00:31:32,791 --> 00:31:34,625
No pressure...

835
00:31:34,708 --> 00:31:36,291
Not sure what'll we do...

836
00:31:36,375 --> 00:31:37,250
But...

837
00:31:37,333 --> 00:31:39,875
I have feeling it'll be big.

838
00:31:42,291 --> 00:31:43,250
[NAEGI] All right...

839
00:31:43,333 --> 00:31:44,500
Let's do this.

840
00:31:44,583 --> 00:31:46,791
I can't say I'll miss
this place much.

841
00:31:46,875 --> 00:31:49,125
But it does feel
kinda strange to leave.

842
00:31:49,208 --> 00:31:50,583
Before we go,

843
00:31:50,666 --> 00:31:53,666
I just wanna say
congratulations.

844
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:56,333
It's kind of our graduation
ceremony, isn't it?

845
00:31:57,750 --> 00:32:00,083
[NAEGI] Hope never dies...

846
00:32:00,166 --> 00:32:02,791
Not if we refuse to let it.

847
00:32:02,875 --> 00:32:05,000
However scared you are...

848
00:32:05,083 --> 00:32:06,958
You gotta push forward...

849
00:32:07,041 --> 00:32:09,375
Always.

850
00:32:09,458 --> 00:32:11,166
Yes, it takes courage...

851
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:12,833
But remember...

852
00:32:12,916 --> 00:32:15,625
Courage isn't about
not being scared.

853
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:19,708
[NAEGI] It's about
being scared...

854
00:32:19,791 --> 00:32:23,708
and finding the
strength to continue.

855
00:32:23,791 --> 00:32:25,291
In the end...

856
00:32:25,375 --> 00:32:28,291
hope opens doors...

857
00:32:28,375 --> 00:32:31,541
Hope opens doors, and we...

858
00:32:31,625 --> 00:32:33,000
walk through them.

859
00:33:46,916 --> 00:33:48,291
[MONOKUMA laughs]

860
00:33:48,375 --> 00:33:50,125
[MONOKUMA] Interesting...

861
00:33:50,208 --> 00:33:52,583
You thought that was it?

862
00:33:52,666 --> 00:33:54,750
[MONOKUMA cackles]

863
00:33:54,833 --> 00:33:57,000
[MONOKUMA] Bet all o' you
thought I was a puppet,

864
00:33:57,083 --> 00:33:59,291
didn't ya?! Honest mistake...

865
00:33:59,375 --> 00:34:01,333
Lots of people do...

866
00:34:01,416 --> 00:34:02,791
But ohhh...

867
00:34:02,875 --> 00:34:06,500
I am so much more than that!

868
00:34:06,583 --> 00:34:09,083
I'm your damn Principal!

869
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:15,625
[MONOMI] Don't be late for
your first day of school,

870
00:34:15,708 --> 00:34:17,500
boys and girls!
