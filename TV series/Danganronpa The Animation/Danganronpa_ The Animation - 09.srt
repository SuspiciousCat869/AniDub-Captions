1
00:00:19,416 --> 00:00:20,625
Sadly...

2
00:00:20,708 --> 00:00:22,833
inevitable.

3
00:00:22,916 --> 00:00:25,291
[NAEGI] The room had been
barricaded from within.

4
00:00:25,375 --> 00:00:27,208
Dead inside was Ohgami,

5
00:00:27,291 --> 00:00:30,750
who'd just been unmasked as
our kidnapper's inside woman.

6
00:00:30,833 --> 00:00:34,208
This was the fourth murder,
and the most puzzling one yet.

7
00:00:39,583 --> 00:00:40,458
Footprints...

8
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:41,916
Take a look.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,416
[NAEGI] Can't get much
clearer prints than these.

10
00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:53,458
[NAEGI] And now, having
barely seen the evidence

11
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:55,208
the trial's about to begin.

12
00:02:18,666 --> 00:02:20,625
[MONOKUMA] So...
whaddya think, sleuths?

13
00:02:20,708 --> 00:02:22,791
Do you send another
guilty classmate

14
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:25,000
to their awesomely
high-concept death?

15
00:02:25,083 --> 00:02:28,166
Or do you blow it and
get snuffed out en masse?

16
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:31,500
Well, only one way to
find out, am I right?!

17
00:02:31,583 --> 00:02:35,791
Let the wild accusations
and finger-pointing begin!

18
00:02:41,833 --> 00:02:45,125
The killer is Fukawa,
Togami, or Hagakure!

19
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:46,916
They were at the scene!

20
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,083
Sakura asked all three of 'em
to meet her in the game room!

21
00:02:50,166 --> 00:02:51,333
Hah.

22
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:53,833
While it's true enough
that she summoned me,

23
00:02:53,916 --> 00:02:56,416
I wasn't foolish enough to go.

24
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,250
Y-Yeah! I skipped out, too!

25
00:02:58,333 --> 00:02:59,458
Hah! Really...?

26
00:02:59,541 --> 00:03:01,375
Then I must've seen your clone!

27
00:03:01,458 --> 00:03:03,708
Hagakure here is guilty as hell!

28
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:04,416
[HAGAKURE] Y-You...

29
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,500
you saw all o' that?!

30
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:06,333
Oh yeah!

31
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:07,750
So what happened?

32
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:08,958
Okay, sooo...

33
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:11,083
Ohgami wanted to
talk to me alone.

34
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:12,208
But...

35
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:13,875
I chickened out when
I got to the room,

36
00:03:13,958 --> 00:03:15,875
and I hid in a
locker instead.

37
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:18,750
[FUKAWA] And then...!

38
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:23,166
[OHGAMI] I had hoped it
wouldn't have to come to this.

39
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:25,291
[HAGAKURE] Uh... yeah...

40
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:28,250
[OHGAMI] You distrust me,
and we cannot afford that.

41
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:35,041
[HAGAKURE grunts]

42
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:37,041
I have no idea what
she's talking about!

43
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:39,875
So... you killed my friend!

44
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:41,208
Huh?! No way!

45
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:44,125
[ASAHINA] You bastard! I
hope you go out screaming!

46
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:46,333
What're we waiting for?!
Let's put it to a vote!

47
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:47,541
I agree!

48
00:03:47,625 --> 00:03:49,208
I gave you
eyewitness testimony

49
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:52,250
telling you how he murdered
her with a blow to the head!

50
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:53,750
No, that isn't right!

51
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:58,916
You said he only hit her once...

52
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,958
But check it:

53
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:02,291
Ohgami's head didn't
have one injury.

54
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:03,458
It had two.

55
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:05,250
Yeah! Dude's got a point!

56
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:07,083
He does not! 'Cause I...

57
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:08,666
I meant to say he hit her twice.

58
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,250
Aw! You lying sack o' crap!

59
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:11,583
I only hit her the once!

60
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:14,000
[KIRIGIRI] So you admit
you attacked her.

61
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:15,541
Kinda, yeah...

62
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:18,291
I was afraid she was gonna
break me like a breadstick!

63
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:20,083
I panicked and clocked her.

64
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:21,083
Fukawa!

65
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:22,208
Y-Yessir...?!

66
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:24,416
After Hagakure made
good his retreat,

67
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,333
what did you do then?

68
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:28,833
Spare us your stalling!

69
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:29,416
[FUKAWA screams]

70
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,500
Stop!

71
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:33,000
I don't remember
what happened, okay?!

72
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:35,625
Once I was sure Hagakure
wasn't coming back,

73
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:37,166
I crept out of the locker.

74
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:38,375
[FUKAWA whimpers]

75
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:39,541
[OHGAMI groans]

76
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:40,416
Huh...?

77
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,916
[FUKAWA screams]

78
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,250
[FUKAWA] And There
she was, glaring at me,

79
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:45,958
blood streaming
down her face!

80
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:47,500
I couldn't handle it!

81
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:50,416
That's when I passed out,
next to the magazines.

82
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,000
Try asking her...

83
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:54,791
Ah... choo!

84
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:55,833
Ah-ha!

85
00:04:55,916 --> 00:04:57,875
Miss me, bitches?!

86
00:04:57,958 --> 00:05:00,500
You weren't summoned
for a casual chat.

87
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:02,875
Are you the one who
killed Sakura Ohgami?

88
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:05,125
So... this might come
as a shock to you...

89
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:08,250
but I don't know jack about
what Fukawa did or didn't do!

90
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:11,125
Even if I gave a damn,
I ain't got access.

91
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:12,875
I'm catching up
on my beauty sleep

92
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:15,291
when suddenly, someone's
shaking me awake!

93
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:17,541
"Maybe it's Prince
Charming!" I think,

94
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:19,125
so I am ready for action!

95
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:21,208
Instead, I get nightmare-fuel,

96
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:24,000
straight out of an
Italian slasher flick!

97
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,708
[FUKAWA (SHO)] Madam Roid Rage
freaked the crap outta me!

98
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:30,333
I hit her with a
bottle and GTFO'd!

99
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:32,250
Hey, she finally
got hit on!

100
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:34,458
[FUKAWA (SHO) cackles]

101
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:36,125
Man, what a relief...

102
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:39,208
So glad I'm not
Hagakure the Giant-Killer.

103
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:40,666
[NAEGI] Dude,
show some respect

104
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:41,875
--for the dead!
-- [ASAHINA] Enough stalling!

105
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:43,708
Let's put it to a vote already!

106
00:05:43,791 --> 00:05:44,750
[NAEGI] Huh?

107
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:47,291
Well? Come on!
Let's do this thing!

108
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:49,125
[NAEGI] What's going on...?

109
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:51,625
This isn't like her...

110
00:05:51,708 --> 00:05:52,750
Hmph...

111
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:54,208
[ASAHINA] Monokuma!
Start the voting!

112
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:56,291
[NAEGI] Not yet!

113
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:57,666
[ASAHINA] Why not?

114
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:00,208
I'm hung up on
something Sho said.

115
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:02,833
When you hit Ohgami,
where in the room were you?

116
00:06:02,916 --> 00:06:03,958
Tell us.

117
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:05,958
The same place where
Fukawa tagged out!

118
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:08,500
I dropped that beast
at the magazine rack!

119
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:10,083
That's not what happened!

120
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:14,000
Think about it:

121
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:16,708
We found her sitting in a chair.

122
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:18,916
If that second hit
at the magazine rack

123
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,583
is what killed her, then
the body being in the chair

124
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:23,000
doesn't make any sense.

125
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:24,000
Hmph.

126
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:26,250
Why, that's rather
astute of you.

127
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:28,583
However, there were
bloodstains on the floor

128
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:30,458
at the base of the rack.

129
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:31,791
Put simply...

130
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:34,916
Sho's testimony is corroborated
by the evidence...

131
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,166
That is where she
attacked Ohgami.

132
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:38,541
[HAGAKURE] I'm lost.

133
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:40,000
"Jeannie Simmons" here
still did it though, right?

134
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:41,500
No, you schmuck!

135
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:43,833
Where I whacked her and where
she landed don't match up!

136
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:45,250
How dumb are you?!

137
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:47,208
[TOGAMI] Then two
questions remain...

138
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:49,000
Who really killed Ohgami?

139
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:51,833
And how did they dispatch
such a fierce target?

140
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:53,875
Here's the answer to the latter.

141
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:55,000
[NAEGI] What's that?

142
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:57,125
A little souvenir
from the chem lab.

143
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:58,833
Deadly poison.

144
00:06:58,916 --> 00:07:00,916
The cabinets hold
three things:

145
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,250
health supplements...

146
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:03,083
re-agents...

147
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:05,375
and poisonous compounds.

148
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:06,958
Oddly enough,

149
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:09,958
this bottle of poison was tucked
in with the vitamins and such.

150
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:12,708
Now why would this bottle

151
00:07:12,791 --> 00:07:15,833
be sitting among the
health supplements?

152
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:17,041
[ASAHINA swallows]

153
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:18,500
Hmph.

154
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:24,583
[gasping]

155
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:25,916
[MONOKUMA snores]

156
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,791
[MONOKUMA] Wha--?!

157
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:28,583
The hell're
you thinkin'?!

158
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:31,375
Holy crap! I've hit the jackpot!
You're crazier than I am!

159
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:32,750
Now barf it up!

160
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:33,708
Be quiet!

161
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:35,541
Togami...

162
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:37,708
I'd like to look at that,
if you don't mind.

163
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:38,708
Well, then...

164
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,166
Have a ball.

165
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:51,291
Protein.

166
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:52,375
As I thought.

167
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:53,083
Huh?!

168
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:54,416
Correct.

169
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,875
The poison in that
bottle has been replaced

170
00:07:56,958 --> 00:07:58,916
with a mere supplement powder.

171
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,833
And wasn't there an empty cup
meant for supplement drinks

172
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:04,416
on the crime scene floor?

173
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:08,041
I can't possibly imagine what
these two facts might imply.

174
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:08,833
[NAEGI gasps]

175
00:08:08,916 --> 00:08:10,291
I get it!

176
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:14,833
[NAEGI] The protein's
in the poison bottle

177
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:17,500
and the poison
went into the cup!

178
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:22,500
[NAEGI] It could've been
handed to her with a smile

179
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:25,041
and she'd be none the wiser!

180
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,750
Clever sleuthing.

181
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:41,750
And seeing as how it's the
conclusion I've come to,

182
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:43,750
I'm inclined to say
you're right.

183
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:45,791
That's great an' all,
but dude...

184
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:47,833
If there was still
poison in that bottle,

185
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:49,875
outlook not so good!

186
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:52,416
Your concern has been noted.

187
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,958
Now, about those
prints in the chem lab.

188
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:58,125
If I had to hypothesize,
I'd say the killer spilled

189
00:08:58,208 --> 00:09:00,208
some of the protein while
he was swapping it out

190
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:02,833
for the poison, hence the mess.

191
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:04,208
Looking at them...

192
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:07,041
it's safe to assume they
were made with sneakers.

193
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:10,083
To find our murderer, all we
have to do is take a jaunt

194
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:12,958
up to the lab for a
quick baring of soles.

195
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:22,541
It was me.

196
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:23,875
The poison...

197
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:25,875
in the protein drink...

198
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:27,958
I did it...

199
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:31,125
I killed Sakura Ohgami
in cold blood!

200
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:39,291
D'you hear me?

201
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:42,416
I killed Sakura Ohgami
in cold blood!

202
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,833
No! You eighty-sixed her?!

203
00:09:44,916 --> 00:09:45,875
Unreal...

204
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:47,625
That's impossible!

205
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:50,416
You an' she... have been
so close this whole time!

206
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,750
Don't be naïve.

207
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:54,541
Dear Asahina played
her like a fiddle.

208
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:56,666
Ohgami didn't suspect a thing

209
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:59,916
when her bosom friend brought
the fateful protein drink.

210
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,291
No... she didn't...

211
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:05,166
We were in the game room.

212
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:08,291
And Sakura... asked me if...

213
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:10,708
if I could get her
supplement for her.

214
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:12,791
You could hear
opportunity knocking.

215
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:14,666
And so you switched the bottles.

216
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:15,625
Heh.

217
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:17,583
The devious trap was set.

218
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:19,500
All you had to do
was hand her the cup...

219
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:22,750
[NAEGI] It makes sense
but it doesn't...

220
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:24,125
And it worked...

221
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:26,875
[NAEGI] Was she faking
their friendship?

222
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:29,750
I thought Ohgami
meant the world to her!

223
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:32,125
[ASAHINA] What the hell?

224
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:35,458
Do you really not know Sakura
any better than that?!

225
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:36,583
Sho was saying...

226
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:39,333
such despicable things...

227
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:42,166
Things about my best friend!

228
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,041
[NAEGI] When she
said those things,

229
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:46,208
it felt so sincere...

230
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:47,583
And then...

231
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:50,333
after Sakura drank
all of the poison

232
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:52,125
I headed out of the game room.

233
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:53,083
[NAEGI gasps]

234
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:54,708
It didn't go down like that!

235
00:10:57,541 --> 00:11:00,500
Asahina, you forgot something...

236
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:01,791
The barricaded door!

237
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:02,583
[ASAHINA] Huh?

238
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:04,083
[TOGAMI] Explain...

239
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:06,958
[NAEGI] We couldn't even
get to the body at first;

240
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:10,041
the door was jammed
from the inside!

241
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:12,750
That chair was wedged
in there pretty tight.

242
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:15,625
So how did you brace the door
with it from out in the hall?

243
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:16,666
[ASAHINA stammers]

244
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:19,125
If you can't tell us
how you did it,

245
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:21,416
then you're not the guilty one!

246
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,875
But I am...

247
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:26,500
Don't be a fool!

248
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:28,500
Asahina confessed to the deed!

249
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:30,750
You would acquit her
over an errant chair?!

250
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:32,125
[KIRIGIRI] I have some evidence

251
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:34,125
I think you'll find
hard to ignore.

252
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:35,250
[ALL gasp]

253
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:36,291
[KIRIGIRI] In fact...

254
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:38,583
you're the one
who gave it to me.

255
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:40,041
[TOGAMI]
Am I now?

256
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:43,666
[TOGAMI] What's
that in the powder?

257
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,541
[NAEGI] Wait, is that...

258
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:48,708
a piece of glass from
when I broke the window?

259
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,208
[KIRIGIRI] Yes...

260
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:52,625
Glass from that window somehow
made its way into a bottle

261
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:54,833
over in the chemistry lab.

262
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:55,875
Bizarre...

263
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:57,666
But the mystery
doesn't end there.

264
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,666
When we entered the game room,

265
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:02,541
did you notice the arrangement
of the broken glass?

266
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:07,208
It should have been on top of
the cup, not pinned beneath it.

267
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:09,250
There's something about
the bottle of poison

268
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:10,958
and the cup we don't yet know.

269
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:12,250
[NAEGI gasps]

270
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:14,166
[NAEGI] That's it!
I've figured it out!

271
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:16,291
[TOGAMI gasps]

272
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:18,250
[NAEGI] The glass
got into the bottle...

273
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:20,583
'cause it was in the game
room to begin with!

274
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,916
[NAEGI] Ohgami!

275
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
[NAEGI] You see...

276
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:27,833
while we were all
looking at Ohgami,

277
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:29,791
someone grabbed the
bottle off the floor

278
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:32,166
and took it back to the lab.

279
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:35,166
And then later, slipped
back into the game room,

280
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:38,000
and planted that cup like it
had been there the whole time;

281
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:40,500
Never even thinking
about the glass...

282
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:43,416
All that just to
throw us off the trail!

283
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:47,125
[KIRIGIRI] Don't forget:
the yellow powder

284
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:49,250
spilled all over the
floor of the lab

285
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:51,750
was on top of Ohgami's feet.

286
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:53,750
She didn't merely
walk through the powder

287
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:55,333
once it was on the floor.

288
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:58,083
No, she was there when it fell.

289
00:12:58,166 --> 00:13:02,375
Perhaps she was rummaging
about for the poison...

290
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:05,958
and knocked over the other
bottle in the process.

291
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:07,583
Which, of course...

292
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:10,541
means that Ohgami
grabbed the poison herself.

293
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:12,458
This murder...

294
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:14,083
was a suicide...

295
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:18,583
[NAEGI] The room was locked...

296
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:20,958
'cause the killer never left.

297
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:25,875
[NAEGI] That's why
she jammed the door.

298
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:27,833
She meant to kill herself...

299
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:30,750
and she wasn't about
to let us interfere...

300
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:41,666
[NAEGI] Here's how
things might've gone:

301
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:45,041
Ohgami asks Hagakure,
Fukawa, and Togami

302
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:47,250
to come see her in
the game room.

303
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:51,208
[ASAHINA] You want those
three to meet up with you?!

304
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:53,041
What are you
thinking, Sakura?!

305
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:54,958
Why're you putting
yourself at risk?!

306
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:56,875
No one's going
to try anything.

307
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:58,625
Don't you forget:

308
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:00,666
These aren't foes to be beat.

309
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:03,000
We're friends here, all of us.

310
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:05,750
[NAEGI] She was right to
be afraid for Ohgami...

311
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:08,458
Hagakure and Fukawa
both attacked her...

312
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:10,250
Sakura!

313
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:12,166
We need to get you stitched up!

314
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:14,333
If you insist...

315
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:15,333
But first...

316
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:17,583
could you get me
my protein powder?

317
00:14:17,666 --> 00:14:19,208
You... want a
supplement?

318
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:20,416
Right now?

319
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,791
It'll help...

320
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:25,166
Oh, okay then! Sit tight!
I'll be back in a jiff!

321
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:32,875
[NAEGI] But when Asahina
saw the powder scattered

322
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:34,958
in front of the
poison cabinet...

323
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:39,000

486
00:22:32,458 --> 00:22:34,541
I'm sorry I tried to kill you.

487
00:22:34,625 --> 00:22:35,625
[NAEGI] It's okay.

488
00:22:35,708 --> 00:22:37,500
You were mad,
and with good reason.

489
00:22:37,583 --> 00:22:39,333
No worries.

490
00:22:39,416 --> 00:22:42,333
[ASAHINA] But I...
please forgive me.

491
00:22:42,416 --> 00:22:44,666
Do stop apologizing...

492
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:48,000
Your actions were hideous,
but evidently understandable.

493
00:22:48,083 --> 00:22:50,333
Uh...

494
00:22:50,416 --> 00:22:51,750
Thanks, Togami.

495
00:22:51,833 --> 00:22:55,500
O-ho! You better not be
making eyes at my man, Funbags!

496
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:56,875
What?!

497
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:59,916
I am not interested in
that douchey four-eyed fop!

498
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,875
[TOGAMI] I just accepted
your apology!

499
00:23:01,958 --> 00:23:03,416
[FUKAWA (SHO)] So now
you insult him?!

500
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:04,666
[ASAHINA] It's not my fault

501
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:05,750
--[NAEGI] And just like that,
--he's a douche!

502
00:23:05,833 --> 00:23:07,041
the trials came to an end.

503
00:23:07,125 --> 00:23:09,291
[TOGAMI] Why are you
baiting a serial killer?!

504
00:23:09,375 --> 00:23:10,416
[NAEGI] However...

505
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,458
our story isn't over.

506
00:23:13,833 --> 00:23:15,083
[KIRIGIRI] Naegi...

507
00:23:15,166 --> 00:23:16,541
Wake up!

508
00:23:18,625 --> 00:23:19,666
[NAEGI] Kiri?

509
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:20,958
What're you...?

510
00:23:21,041 --> 00:23:22,416
[KIRIGIRI] I'll be waiting
in the computer lab

511
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,875
on the fourth floor.

512
00:23:23,958 --> 00:23:25,333
[NAEGI] Huh?

513
00:23:30,708 --> 00:23:32,166
[NAEGI] The door's locked...

514
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:34,625
and no sign of
Kirigiri anywhere.

515
00:23:34,708 --> 00:23:36,291
Why am I up here?

516
00:23:36,375 --> 00:23:39,333
[MONOKUMA] If it isn't
Mr. Kumbaya himself!

517
00:23:39,416 --> 00:23:41,333
It's three in the
damn morning, kid!

518
00:23:41,416 --> 00:23:43,458
--Jeebus, go to bed!
--[KIRIGIRI] Am I interrupting

519
00:23:43,541 --> 00:23:44,208
something?

520
00:23:44,291 --> 00:23:45,166
--Huh?
--Hm?!

521
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:46,291
[NAEGI] Oh, hey!

522
00:23:46,375 --> 00:23:47,750
[MONOKUMA] You're up, too?!

523
00:23:47,833 --> 00:23:49,541
Go the eff to sleep!

524
00:23:49,625 --> 00:23:50,625
Very well.

525
00:23:50,708 --> 00:23:52,750
Naegi. Walk me back.

526
00:23:52,833 --> 00:23:53,333
Huh?

527
00:23:53,416 --> 00:23:54,791
Ohhh yeah.

528
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:58,208
[NAEGI] So, uh...

529
00:23:58,291 --> 00:23:59,666
what's going on?

530
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:05,416
There's another student...

531
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,916
Lurking in the shadows

532
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
somewhere within this building.

533
00:24:09,083 --> 00:24:10,208
[NAEGI gasps]

534
00:24:10,291 --> 00:24:12,458
There's a Super High
School-Level Despair.

535
00:24:12,541 --> 00:24:15,375
Named Mukuro Ikusaba.

536
00:24:15,458 --> 00:24:17,041
There's another one of us...

537
00:24:17,125 --> 00:24:19,208
in the building?
