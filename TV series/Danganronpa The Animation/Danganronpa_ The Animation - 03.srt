1
00:00:17,625 --> 00:00:19,458
[NAEGI]
Hope's Peak High School...

2
00:00:19,541 --> 00:00:22,291
A hell on earth where the
only way to graduate

3
00:00:22,375 --> 00:00:23,750
is murder.

4
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:28,083
[NAEGI] As long as you don't
get caught, you go free.

5
00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:32,416
[NAEGI] And now
Maizono's dead...

6
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,333
Butchered.

7
00:00:34,416 --> 00:00:36,250
The prime suspect is me...

8
00:00:36,333 --> 00:00:38,000
Thing is, I'm innocent.

9
00:00:38,083 --> 00:00:41,333
She would tell you herself:
I couldn't hurt a fly.

10
00:00:45,875 --> 00:00:47,375
[NAEGI] Here we go...

11
00:00:47,458 --> 00:00:49,291
Good luck, everybody.

12
00:00:51,541 --> 00:00:52,916
[NAEGI] We're gonna need it.

13
00:00:59,833 --> 00:01:00,791
Holy crap...

14
00:01:00,875 --> 00:01:02,416
Swank for a courtroom.

15
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:03,916
[MONOKUMA] Goodie gumdrop!

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,791
Took your time, I see.

17
00:01:07,375 --> 00:01:08,791
[MONOKUMA] Be honest, now:

18
00:01:08,875 --> 00:01:11,458
you were expecting something
considerably less tasteful.

19
00:01:11,541 --> 00:01:13,583
Screwed up either way,
if you ask me.

20
00:01:13,666 --> 00:01:14,750
Before we start...

21
00:01:14,833 --> 00:01:15,916
[ALL] Huh?

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,458
I have a question
relevant to our task.

23
00:01:18,541 --> 00:01:19,833
Why the portraits?

24
00:01:19,916 --> 00:01:20,958
[MONOKUMA] Why not?

25
00:01:21,041 --> 00:01:22,166
Just 'cause they're dead,

26
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:23,958
I'd hate for them to
miss the proceedings.

27
00:01:24,041 --> 00:01:26,500
[CELESTIA] And the extra
podium belongs to whom?

28
00:01:26,583 --> 00:01:29,250
Counting our departed
classmates, we number fifteen.

29
00:01:29,333 --> 00:01:30,958
Why sixteen places?

30
00:01:31,041 --> 00:01:32,791
[MONOKUMA] You're readin'
too much into it, darlin'.

31
00:01:32,875 --> 00:01:35,375
The extra podium just means
this courtroom is tricked out

32
00:01:35,458 --> 00:01:37,625
for a maximum of sixteen jurors.

33
00:01:37,708 --> 00:01:38,958
Speaking of which:

34
00:01:39,041 --> 00:01:41,208
that's all the time we've
got for pleasantries.

35
00:01:41,291 --> 00:01:45,083
Ladies and germs,
time to get judicial!

36
00:01:45,166 --> 00:01:46,416
This is jacked up...

37
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,666
Nobody here really thinks
one of us killed her?

38
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:49,750
Hmph.

39
00:01:49,833 --> 00:01:51,333
[MONOKUMA] They'd
be correct, m'boy!

40
00:01:51,416 --> 00:01:52,750
No room for doubt, I'm afraid.

41
00:01:52,833 --> 00:01:54,583
Right. Everybody
close your eyes!

42
00:01:54,666 --> 00:01:56,708
If you're the murderer
raise your hand!

43
00:01:56,791 --> 00:01:59,208
Yeah, that'll float
like an old lady's fart.

44
00:01:59,291 --> 00:02:00,875
[MONOKUMA laughs]

45
00:02:00,958 --> 00:02:02,125
[MONOKUMA] Enough chit chat...

46
00:02:02,208 --> 00:02:04,625
Commence debating
for your lives!

47
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:06,875
[NAEGI] I've got to
stay focused...

48
00:02:06,958 --> 00:02:09,250
Unless I can convince them I
didn't do it,

49
00:02:09,333 --> 00:02:10,750
we're all done for.

50
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,333
So, uh...

51
00:02:24,416 --> 00:02:25,750
How does debating work?

52
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:27,666
Knowing where to start's
half the battle.

53
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,333
Well, I suggest we begin by
considering the murder weapon

54
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:32,166
itself, see where
that takes us.

55
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:34,291
We can be sure it was
the weapon because of

56
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:35,458
where it was found...

57
00:02:35,541 --> 00:02:37,208
Sticking out of the
victim's mid-section

58
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:38,833
is not generally
where a knife is kept!

59
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:40,041
[OHWADA] Congratulations.

60
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:41,291
You're good.

61
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:43,000
[NAEGI] Don't blow him off;
it's important.

62
00:02:43,083 --> 00:02:44,166
[OHWADA] What?

63
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,000
Just stop and think
about it for a sec.

64
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:47,583
The knife had to come
from the kitchen.

65
00:02:47,666 --> 00:02:49,166
So does...

66
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:51,291
that mean anyone who was in the
kitchen last night is a suspect?

67
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:53,708
He's just tryin' to
get us to split hairs.

68
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:55,541
He's the killer, remember?

69
00:02:55,625 --> 00:02:56,958
[ASAHINA] Wait, you know what?

70
00:02:57,041 --> 00:03:00,166
I think I can prove Naegi
isn't the one who took it!

71
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,208
[gasping]

72
00:03:01,291 --> 00:03:02,791
I would know, 'cause
Sakura and me

73
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:05,041
spent most of the day yesterday
hangin' out in the cafeteria.

74
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:08,000
[CELESTIA] I'm sorry...
Sakura is who, exactly?

75
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:09,333
No offense.

76
00:03:09,416 --> 00:03:10,791
None taken.

77
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:14,583
[OHGAMI] We were
there until late...

78
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:16,958
Enjoying a lovely evening
tea, as it happens.

79
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:18,250
[ASAHINA] I was on edge...

80
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:20,541
Sakura was sweet enough
to keep me company

81
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:21,791
and try and calm my nerves.

82
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:23,666
[FUKAWA] Phugh, well...!
What if you both did it?

83
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,000
If you teamed up...

84
00:03:25,083 --> 00:03:27,291
you'd just have to keep
your stories straight.

85
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:30,083
[MONOKUMA] Oh, please note:
if two or more people team up

86
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:32,166
to commit murder,
only the actual killer

87
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:33,375
is eligible for graduation.

88
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:34,875
No exceptions.

89
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:37,000
Yes. It's clearly
stated in the rules.

90
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:38,250
I see...

91
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:40,416
In other words, no one
stands to gain anything

92
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,500
from opting to team up.

93
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:42,583
[FUKAWA] Yeah, fine...

94
00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:44,250
Then stop beating
around the bush

95
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:46,000
and tell us who took
the knife already!

96
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:46,875
Swim-hussy!

97
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:48,375
You take that back!

98
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:50,541
[OHGAMI] As Asahina said,
we were there for some time...

99
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:51,916
We know who took the knife

100
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,541
because we witnessed
its removal.

101
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:55,375
[TOGAMI] Why did you
not mention this sooner?

102
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:56,666
I guess...

103
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,791
'Cause it's... rude to
speak ill of the dead.

104
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:00,208
Wait, what?

105
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:01,958
[ASAHINA] It was Maizono...

106
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:05,291
I don't know why,
but it was definitely her.

107
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:06,916
But that doesn't
make sense...

108
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,833
Why would she take the knife?

109
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:10,958
[OHGAMI] I'm afraid
there can be no doubt.

110
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,000
How does royal
milk tea sound?

111
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:15,708
You're nice enough to stay
here; I should go all out.

112
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:17,916
[door opens]

113
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,208
Oh. Hi...

114
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:21,666
Just thought I'd get
myself something to drink.

115
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:24,666
[ASAHINA] At the time, it didn't
strike me as weird or anything.

116
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:25,916
[OHGAMI] Nor I.

117
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,958
[ISHIMARU] I see...

118
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:28,666
So the victim
procured the weapon

119
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,625
that would then end her life!

120
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:32,083
[MAIZONO] Good night.
Sweet dreams.

121
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:34,791
--Yes. Good night.
--Huh? Sure! Same to you.

122
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,250
[OHGAMI] Hm...?

123
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:40,041
Of course. Yeah...

124
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:42,250
She must've wanted it
to protect herself!

125
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:43,750
That being the case...

126
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:46,333
The very thing she thought to
fend off her attacker with

127
00:04:46,416 --> 00:04:47,708
proved her undoing...

128
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:50,125
Simple, tragic irony
at its finest.

129
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:51,125
Yeah, no kidding.

130
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:52,833
All the same, Naegi...

131
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:55,125
You're still rather far
from clearing your name

132
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:56,791
in this bloody business.

133
00:04:56,875 --> 00:04:58,625
[FUKAWA] Ah-ha! See?!

134
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:00,875
There's murder written
all over his face!

135
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:02,791
Damn it, I told you
it wasn't me!

136
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:04,750
Ooh! En garde, everyone!

137
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:08,041
He's attempting to steer
the debate in his favor!

138
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:10,500
What a skilled
manipulator you are!

139
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:13,708
[NAEGI] C'mon; why aren't
you getting it?!

140
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:17,333
If you pin this on me,
we all get executed!

141
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:20,333
[KIRIGIRI] Careful.

142
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:22,541
I'm of the opinion
it's still too early

143
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:24,166
to point the finger at Naegi.

144
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:25,541
[ALL gasp]

145
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:27,916
[KIRIGIRI] There's evidence
we're not considering.

146
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,041
[NAEGI gasps]

147
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:30,458
You believe me...?

148
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:31,833
[OHGAMI] What "evidence?"

149
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:34,958
I submit to you all the
state of the crime scene.

150
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:37,708
Did the culprit appear to
have easy access to the shower?

151
00:05:37,791 --> 00:05:38,750
I think not.

152
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:40,416
[CELESTIA] What
are you driving at? 

153
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,625
[NAEGI] The doorknob to
my shower was thrashed.

154
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:43,625
I saw it.

155
00:05:43,708 --> 00:05:44,791
[YAMADA] In point of fact,

156
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:46,708
it did look like it'd
seen better days.

157
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:48,750
So?! What is that
supposed to prove

158
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:50,333
except he broke it
to get at his prey?!

159
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:51,750
Animal!

160
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:53,958
[KIRIGIRI] That one
small detail convinces me

161
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:55,500
that Naegi couldn't have
been the murderer.

162
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,791
What're you, nuts?
He needed in: Boom...

163
00:05:57,875 --> 00:05:59,458
He broke it; end of story...

164
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:02,416
He didn't have any choice 'cause
she locked the door on him.

165
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,000
I can prove you wrong!

166
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,791
The shower doors don't
lock in the boys' rooms...

167
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:10,458
Only the girls' showers do.

168
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:12,583
Yeah? And how do you know that?

169
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:14,291
[NAEGI]
Monokuma said so himself.

170
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:16,083
Our showers don't have
locks installed...

171
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:17,583
Go on sir, tell them!

172
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:19,875
[MONOKUMA] Huh? Yeah,
sure. Whatever.

173
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:22,000
But, then why'd the killer
have to go to the trouble

174
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:24,375
of breaking the doorknob
to get at Maizono?

175
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:27,375
[NAEGI] Because my door's wonky.
There's a trick to opening it.

176
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:28,750
[FUJISAKI gasps]

177
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:30,833
They didn't know...
figured the door was locked...

178
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:34,083
For all intents and purposes,
to them it was a girl's room...

179
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:36,958
They'd have thought the only
option was to bust the doorknob.

180
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:39,416
[KIRIGIRI] If Naegi were the
murderer, he'd've been aware

181
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,666
the door doesn't lock and,
knowing the trick to opening it,

182
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:42,791
simply walked in.

183
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:45,166
[FUKAWA] Makes sense...
I suppose. Ugh.

184
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,083
[murmuring]

185
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:48,458
Whoa, thank you.

186
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:50,166
Don't get too
comfortable...

187
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:51,750
We're not done yet.

188
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:54,666
[CELESTIA] Let us assume the
murderer is someone else...

189
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:57,083
Where would they get the
idea the door was locked?

190
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:59,166
Were they not aware that
the two had switched rooms?

191
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:00,833
And why be there if they didn't?

192
00:07:00,916 --> 00:07:02,125
That's the point...

193
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:04,000
From the evidence, I think
we can safely assume

194
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:07,375
the killer believed he or she
was actually in Maizono's room.

195
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:08,958
[FUJISAKI] Let me
get this straight...

196
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:11,750
You're saying the culprit was
in the dark about the room swap?

197
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:14,333
[FUKAWA] Please... We were
all in the dark about it!

198
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:16,958
This ain't exactly narrowing
our list of suspects!

199
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:19,625
So? Then we put it
to a majority vote...

200
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:21,333
That could work... Yeah.

201
00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:23,875
I mean... we are in
a bit of a pinch, right?

202
00:07:23,958 --> 00:07:26,041
Either we put someone
on the chopping block

203
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:27,375
or we all get the axe.

204
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:30,333
No need to throw our hands
in the air, Yasuhiro...

205
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:32,083
The devil is in the details...

206
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:33,750
I urge you all to focus.

207
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:35,291
[ASAHINA] Now that
I think about it...

208
00:07:35,375 --> 00:07:37,791
If Maizono was freaked out
like Naegi says,

209
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:39,625
how'd the killer get into
the room to begin with?

210
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:41,041
She wouldn't have let 'em in.

211
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:42,708
[FUJISAKI] Was the lock picked?

212
00:07:42,791 --> 00:07:44,000
[ISHIMARU] Not possible.

213
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:46,000
The tumblers are all
reinforced electronically.

214
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:46,916
Heh-heh!

215
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,166
Prepare yourselves

216
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,083
for an ingenious bit of
sleuthing, friends!

217
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:52,708
Contrary to the assumption
we've been laboring under,

218
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:54,708
I put it to you
that Maizono indeed

219
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:55,791
let the killer in herself!

220
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:56,916
C'mon, man.

221
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,458
[YAMADA] Hmm...?

222
00:07:58,541 --> 00:08:00,541
We've been over this; she was
too scared to open the door.

223
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:03,708
Ah... You certainly have the
right to your opinion, but...

224
00:08:03,791 --> 00:08:05,000
Logic!

225
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:07,375
I'd agree with you,
except we'd both be wrong!

226
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:09,625
I know what I saw.

227
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:13,833
When she came to me...
she was practically in tears.

228
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:16,041
[NAEGI] Whatever you do,
don't open the door.

229
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:17,041
Promise me.

230
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:18,375
[MAIZONO] You got it.

231
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:20,125
That door's staying locked
even if I know it's you

232
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:21,000
on the other side.

233
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:22,333
Would sorta defeat the purpose

234
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:24,000
of swapping rooms
otherwise, right?

235
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:26,333
[NAEGI] I don't know about you,
but I have a pretty hard time

236
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:27,583
believing she'd
answer the door

237
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:29,083
after saying
something like that.

238
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:30,958
[KIRIGIRI]
Perhaps that was the idea...

239
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:33,458
Her terror could
have been a ruse.

240
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:35,458
[ALL gasp]

241
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:36,333
[NAEGI] No...

242
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:38,083
She wouldn't lie to me!

243
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:40,166
Maizono and I were friends!

244
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:41,583
Yes, I will grant you,

245
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:44,125
it is an unpleasant
possibility to consider...

246
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:46,333
But, I'm afraid, necessary.

247
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:49,291
[MAIZONO] "There's something I
want to talk about in private.

248
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:52,541
Please come to my room. Make
sure to check the nameplate

249
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:54,958
so you don't go to the
wrong room by mistake.

250
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:56,416
Sayaka Maizono"

251
00:08:57,833 --> 00:08:59,791
What's that s'posed to be...?

252
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:02,125
The impression of a
letter she wrote.

253
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,875
I found it on the
notepad in your room...

254
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:06,208
I'm sorry.

255
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:09,250
Are you trying to say
it was you who wrote this?

256
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:11,458
No... It wasn't.

257
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:14,166
Of course not...
I thought as much.

258
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:17,708
As you can see, the
signature is quite legible.

259
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:20,166
[NAEGI] I don't get it.
Why would she...?

260
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:22,083
[KIRIGIRI] I think
she wrote this letter

261
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:25,000
with the intent of luring
someone to their death.

262
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:26,250
[NAEGI gasps]

263
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:27,625
[YAMADA] Someone would
have to be dead inside

264
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:29,875
to overlook a personal
invitation from a teen idol

265
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:32,250
of Maizono's caliber...
That is...

266
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:34,541
unless they were already
perfectly satisfied

267
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:36,083
with those of the 2-D variety.

268
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:37,333
Yes, but...

269
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:40,208
The note clearly says
to come to her room...

270
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:42,250
So there we have
it then, don't we?

271
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:44,125
She wasn't in her room.

272
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:45,666
[FUJISAKI] Right.

273
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:48,625
Whoever it was would've gone to
where Naegi was by mistake.

274
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:50,958
[KIRIGIRI] Ah... but they
wouldn't have, you see.

275
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:52,375
Maizono was clever.

276
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:54,125
[CELESTIA] Really? How so?

277
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:56,291
[KIRIGIRI] After she
and Naegi switched rooms,

278
00:09:56,375 --> 00:10:00,000
she slipped out and
swapped their nameplates.

279
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:03,333
My notebook missed
this detail entirely.

280
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:06,375
[FUJISAKI] Then she was luring
someone into Naegi's room...

281
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:08,000
[TOGAMI] Well,
if memory serves...

282
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:10,333
I believe the phrase
tossed out a little earlier

283
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:12,083
was "luring someone
to their death."

284
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:13,708
Yes... Seems so...

285
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:16,250
And it's the only logical
conclusion left...

286
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:18,750
Of course, that points the
finger away from Naegi.

287
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:19,875
Finally...

288
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:22,916
Fine. Whatever...
So who killed her?

289
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,625
Isn't it obvious?

290
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:29,958
Whoever she invited to my room
turned the tables on her...

291
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:31,375
Got to her first.

292
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:32,541
[gasping]

293
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:34,500
We're actually going
with this idea

294
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:37,416
that she swapped rooms with
Naegi to try and off someone?

295
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,416
[TOGAMI] Far from
the worst of gambits...

296
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,000
Once the deed was done,
she'd have an out...

297
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:44,041
She had but to switch
the nameplates back

298
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:45,125
to pin it on you.

299
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:46,416
She'd never do tha--!

300
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,041
[TOGAMI] Oh please... Wake up!

301
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:51,583
What could she have possibly
been up to if not that?

302
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:54,583
Her fatal misstep, of course,
was inadvertently giving

303
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:58,625
her prospective victim the
opportunity to fight back.

304
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:00,875
They got the first strike
in with that katana!

305
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:04,000
[CELESTIA] No. That was
used in self-defense.

306
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:06,916
[TOGAMI] Yes, the damage to
the sheath implies as much...

307
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,833
Had things gone
according to plan...

308
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:10,750
Maizono would be
standing here now,

309
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:12,875
pointing the finger at Naegi.

310
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:15,291
I trusted her...
Why would she...

311
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:17,041
[CELESTIA] Why wouldn't she?

312
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:19,000
It was an ironclad
way out of here

313
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:20,541
was it not?

314
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:23,541
If we omit the fact that it
was a spectacular failure, yes.

315
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:24,458
Poor fool.

316
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:25,875
Don't talk about
her like that!

317
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:28,833
Oh, I'm sorry. You have
a reason to defend her?

318
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:29,916
No! But still--!

319
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,333
[KIRIGIRI] Calm down.

320
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:33,708
This isn't the time
to argue. Focus.

321
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:35,083
Yes, quite right.

322
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:37,958
The murderer is still at large,
and time is short.

323
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:40,916
Let's get to it, then.
It's one of us.

324
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,500
[HAGAKURE] Well, duh! But
how the hell do we pick?!

325
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:46,708
Ugh! We're all goners! I know
it! I'm too young to die!

326
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:48,375
It's not fair!

327
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:49,750
[NAEGI] I gotta think!

328
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:51,625
If we don't figure out
who killed her,

329
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:53,833
it's the end for all of us!

330
00:11:53,916 --> 00:11:56,541
There's got to be something
we've missed...

331
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:59,125
[LEON] Well... Guess that's
pretty much it for us...

332
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:02,708
Damn... If only there
was more to go on, right?

333
00:12:02,791 --> 00:12:04,750
We're outta clues.

334
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:06,208
That's where you're wrong!

335
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:10,083
The hell am I missin' then?

336
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:13,000
Something pretty big, actually.

337
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:16,541
She left us a message...
Not the one on the notepad.

338
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:18,625
Wha... What are you drivin' at?

339
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:20,875
She left a dying message.

340
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:23,416
One scrawled in blood
on the wall behind her.

341
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,333
[HAGAKURE] That's right!
What did it say?

342
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:27,833
[ASAHINA] You mean that
random string of numbers?

343
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:30,166
Hey, you're supposed to
be some kinda crazy genius

344
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,666
with numbers, ain'tcha?

345
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,250
The one's she left behind mean
anything special or what?

346
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:36,500
I tried every decryption
trick in the book...

347
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:39,791
but whatever they're supposed
to mean, it's not code I know.

348
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:41,291
I'm sorry...

349
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:43,208
[NAEGI] Break it down...

350
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:46,291
When things took a turn,
Maizono ran for the shower

351
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:48,375
but the killer
forced his way in...

352
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:50,916
Did he already have the knife?

353
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,083
[NAEGI gasps]

354
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:53,958
[NAEGI] That's it! I've got it!

355
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:55,958
[ALL gasp]

356
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:58,916
The message wasn't
a string of numbers!

357
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,708
She wrote out her killer's name!

358
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:02,291
[ALL gasp]

359
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:04,958
[NAEGI] If you flip those marks
around a hundred-eighty degrees,

360
00:13:05,041 --> 00:13:07,333
there you have it,
plain as day...

361
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:10,291
L-E-O-N.

362
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:11,583
Whad'ya know...

363
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:13,750
That's your name, isn't it?

364
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:15,333
Leon Kuwata.

365
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:16,791
[LEON gasps]

366
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,541
So, Leon, if you got
anything to say...

367
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:31,333
Now's the time.

368
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:32,333
[LEON whimpers]

369
00:13:32,416 --> 00:13:34,416
[OHGAMI] Disappointing, Leon.

370
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,916
[LEON] Gimme a break!

371
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,750
You're not seriously listening
to this lying little punk!

372
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:39,708
[KIRIGIRI] Maizono
identified her murderer

373
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:41,000
from beyond the grave...

374
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:43,708
A name written as
her life ebbed away.

375
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:46,208
Scrawled that way 'cause
of the angle of her head...

376
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:49,000
Poor girl probably didn't have
the energy left to hoist herself

377
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:50,666
around the right direction.

378
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:52,708
[LEON] Maybe someone's
trying to frame me!

379
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:54,000
You think of that?

380
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,416
Everything you've got
is circumstantial!

381
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,500
Let's assume you're
not the perpetrator.

382
00:13:58,583 --> 00:14:01,375
Care to explain why you
tried to destroy evidence?

383
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:02,833
[LEON gasps]

384
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:04,750
[ALL gasp]

385
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:06,541
Somebody explain!

386
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:08,125
Yeah, of course!

387
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:10,208
She means those
charred pieces of shirt

388
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:12,750
and glass ball fragments we
found in the garbage room!

389
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:15,250
[YAMADA] Right! I'd
forgotten all about those!

390
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:16,791
[HAGAKURE] Y'know,
come to think of it,

391
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:19,083
I haven't seen my
crystal ball in a while...

392
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:20,750
Think that's what
happened to it?

393
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:22,083
Well, Naegi...

394
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:24,500
Seems you and I are of
the same opinion...

395
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:25,958
Puzzle it out yet?

396
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:31,083
[NAEGI] Here's what
I believe happened...

397
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:33,458
Maizono's killer was
in over his head...

398
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:35,666
He hadn't planned on
killing anyone that night;

399
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,875
the evidence had to
be dealt with fast...

400
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:40,750
Unfortunately, the garbage
room was on lock down.

401
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:43,958
This is where Hagakure's
missing glass ball comes in.

402
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:46,333
Activating the incinerator
from the other side

403
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:49,125
of the gate would be near
impossible for almost anyone.

404
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:51,750
But our culprit had mad skills.

405
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:57,125
Specifically, Super High School
Level Baseball Player skills.

406
00:14:57,208 --> 00:14:59,833
All finished, our perp
figured he could chill,

407
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:02,625
walk back to his room like
nothing had happened...

408
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:05,541
That, as it turns out,
was his big mistake...

409
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:08,000
A scrap of the burning
bloodstained shirt sleeve

410
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:10,791
fell out... Gotcha.
Hard evidence...

411
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:13,250
He thought he'd improvised
the perfect crime,

412
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:16,375
when in fact he'd left a trail
leading us right to him.

413
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:22,166
Deny if you want,
that's how it went.

414
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,583
You stand accused.
Now'd be the time to object.

415
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:35,750
[LEON] Object? Hah. Yeah...
Let me think about that.

416
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:39,083
You're damn right I object!
This is all a buncha BS!

417
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:42,875
Oh-ho ho ho, hell to the no!
Think I'm takin' the wrap?!

418
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:45,083
You're the only one here
with the athletic chops

419
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:47,208
to throw Hagakure's
glass ball far enough

420
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:48,958
and hard enough to
hit the incinerator switch

421
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:50,166
and you know it!

422
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,416
[LEON] Yeah! Nice
try, but screw you!

423
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,875
What about Yamada?!
He's on trash detail!

424
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:56,416
He could've unlocked the gate!

425
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,958
Which is exactly why he wouldn't
have needed to use the ball;

426
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,958
he would've just used his
access key and walked off

427
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:02,458
without any of us having a clue.

428
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:05,958
Ha-ha! Yeah, big man, tryin'
to trick me into fessin' up!

429
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:08,916
Well, like I said,
it's all circumstantial!

430
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,291
Maybe. But there's still one
vital piece of evidence

431
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:13,541
that points directly at you.

432
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:15,583
What, you gonna make
somethin' up now?!

433
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:17,291
The bathroom... The doorknob...

434
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:18,708
The screws were removed.

435
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:20,750
Who gives a flyin' rat's ass?!

436
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:22,666
[NAEGI] How exactly do
you think the murderer

437
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,333
removed those screws, huh?

438
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:26,333
[LEON] Whatever you're
drivin' at, jerkwad,

439
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:28,500
you are barking up
the wrong tree!

440
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:30,916
[NAEGI] Well if what I'm
driving at is on the money...

441
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,291
There'll be proof
in your toolkit.

442
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:35,250
How 'bout you give us a look?

443
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:37,750
[LEON] Never-never-never-never
never-never-never-never!

444
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:39,708
This is a sham!
I'm warning you, dude!

445
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:41,291
Back off!

446
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:44,833
[NAEGI] You're guilty,
Leon Kuwata!

447
00:16:44,916 --> 00:16:47,666
I demand you show us
what's inside your toolkit!

448
00:16:53,291 --> 00:16:55,375
Come on. What's the big deal?

449
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:57,166
What have you got to hide?

450
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:02,500
Bear in mind, if it's been
used, prepare to explain...

451
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:05,583
In minute detail and 'til every
last one of us is satisfied.

452
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:07,250
And under the circumstances...

453
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:10,208
Not knowing is not
going to be acceptable.

454
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:14,416
[LEON stutters]

455
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:22,291
Predictable... He has nothing
to say in his defense.

456
00:17:24,416 --> 00:17:26,166
I'm sorry, man.

457
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:27,750
[MONOKUMA laughs]

458
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:30,416
[MONOKUMA] I'd say you kids have
hashed this one out nicely...

459
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,916
Major kudos! Let's
move on to Voting Time!

460
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,958
Kindly lock in your votes
by pressing the switches

461
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:39,041
there in front of you.

462
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:43,708
Who's the guilty so-and-so? Feel
good about your final choice?

463
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:45,375
And the award goes to...

464
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,125
[drum roll]

465
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:56,125
[machine whistles]

466
00:17:57,625 --> 00:17:58,958
[MONOKUMA] Correct!

467
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:00,541
Well done, peeps!

468
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:03,666
Sayaka Maizono's
murderer was indeed...

469
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,791
Leon Kuwata!

470
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:07,250
I...

471
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:10,250
[ASAHINA] Oh wow...

472
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:13,625
You dumbass! What the
hell got into you?!

473
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:15,250
[LEON] I didn't want to...

474
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:16,666
She was...

475
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:19,750
I mean, she was tryin'
to kill me, right?

476
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:20,958
I just...

477
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:23,083
I didn't know what
else to do, okay?

478
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:24,708
What if she'd gone after you?!

479
00:18:24,791 --> 00:18:27,416
You'd all'a done the
same thing in my shoes!

480
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:30,625
[LEON sobs]

481
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:32,416
[MONOKUMA] Right,
so there you have it!

482
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,916
Excellent job dispensing tough
justice; and I mean that...

483
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,416
Moving on now to
the punishment phase!

484
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,666
No! I didn't have a choice!

485
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:44,708
The crazy skank was gonna kill
me, what was I s'posed to do?!

486
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:45,458
Come on, guys...

487
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,916
I acted in self-defense!

488
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,958
Special circumstances!
I-I'm not really a murderer!

489
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:52,166
[MONOKUMA] Yes, yes.

490
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:54,291
I'm sure we're all
relieved to hear that.

491
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:56,750
But rules are rules;
too bad, so sad.

492
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:58,500
No, wait! It's not right!

493
00:18:58,583 --> 00:19:01,791
[MONOKUMA] "Right"?! Right don't
enter into it, sweetheart.

494
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:06,083
You killed and got caught.
Which means you die.

495
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:09,416
[LEON] Nuh... no...! No!

496
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,791
Get me out of this place!

497
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:12,541
[MONOKUMA] For all-star
athlete Leon Kuwata,

498
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:15,333
whose talents behind the plate
certainly held more promise

499
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:16,875
than his career as
a lady killer,

500
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:19,708
I've come up with a very
special method of execution...

501
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:22,041
Play ball!

502
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:25,625
Nooooo!

503
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:04,875
[MONOKUMA] Ha-ha!

504
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:07,625
Now that's what I call extreme!

505
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:11,458
I feel the adrenaline coursing
through me like lightning!

506
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,000
[whimpering]

507
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:16,750
[FUKAWA] What is going on here?
Someone wake me up, pleeease!

508
00:21:16,833 --> 00:21:20,166
[FUJISAKI] I-I... I just...
I can't take this.

509
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:23,250
[MONOKUMA] Now, now. It's not
so bad, once you get used to it.

510
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:25,666
Abandon all hope of seeing
the light of day again,

511
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:27,750
and you'll be fine. Promise...

512
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:30,791
'Course, now that I hear myself
say it out loud,

513
00:21:30,875 --> 00:21:32,583
it does sound pretty cruel...

514
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:38,125
[MONOKUMA] There, there, Naegi.
It's all right. I know.

515
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:40,833
[NAEGI] Know what?
What are you talking about?

516
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:44,166
[MONOKUMA] Don't be like that.
Maizono sold you up the river.

517
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:45,625
You're hurtin', it's fine.

518
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:47,916
[NAEGI] Screw you!

519
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,333
You did this...

520
00:21:49,416 --> 00:21:52,583
It was all your fault
from beginning to end!

521
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:54,916
Don't, Naegi... Don't lose it...

522
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,833
Think about this; you will never
avenge her

523
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:58,291
if you get killed too.

524
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:00,958
Damn it!

525
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:04,083
[NAEGI] Damn it all...

526
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:09,041
[doorbell rings]

527
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:16,958
[KIRIGIRI] I know now's
probably not the best time,

528
00:22:17,041 --> 00:22:18,666
but I need to talk with you.

529
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:21,625
[NAEGI] It's about her,
isn't it? Maizono...

530
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:23,083
[KIRIGIRI] Yeah.

531
00:22:25,416 --> 00:22:26,541
I'll be frank.

532
00:22:26,625 --> 00:22:29,041
It may be undeniable
that Maizono meant to

533
00:22:29,125 --> 00:22:30,583
frame you for murder...

534
00:22:30,666 --> 00:22:33,166
The facts paint too
clear a picture...

535
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:34,416
That said...

536
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:38,416
What do you imagine
her dying thoughts were?

537
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:41,166
[NAEGI] How the hell
should I know?

538
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:42,958
Naegi, I'm serious...

539
00:22:43,041 --> 00:22:45,416
You knew her well
enough to speculate...

540
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,625
Personally, I believe
her last thoughts

541
00:22:47,708 --> 00:22:49,166
were of how to save you.

542
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:52,000
I think we can surmise that's
what she wanted in the end.

543
00:22:52,083 --> 00:22:53,333
[NAEGI gasps]

544
00:22:53,416 --> 00:22:55,208
[KIRIGIRI] Why else leave
the message, correct?

545
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:57,958
She certainly didn't have to.

546
00:22:58,041 --> 00:22:59,416
Yeah, nice try...

547
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,875
I wish I could believe that,
but all she really wanted

548
00:23:01,958 --> 00:23:04,291
was to make sure Leon
paid for killing her.

549
00:23:04,375 --> 00:23:06,750
[KIRIGIRI] I beg to differ.

550
00:23:06,833 --> 00:23:08,125
In fact...

551
00:23:08,208 --> 00:23:10,416
She never meant to hurt you.

552
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,375
She wasn't a killer.

553
00:23:12,458 --> 00:23:14,916
Nor was she comfortable
with deceiving you.

554
00:23:16,791 --> 00:23:19,791
Sadly, she hesitated when
she ought to have been bold

555
00:23:19,875 --> 00:23:21,208
and wound up dead...

556
00:23:21,291 --> 00:23:23,458
Rather a high price to pay.

557
00:23:23,541 --> 00:23:26,750
[NAEGI] So... Why are
you telling me this?

558
00:23:26,833 --> 00:23:28,250
Because I think
you're strong...

559
00:23:28,333 --> 00:23:30,916
You can push through
this intact.

560
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,541
Resilience is a rare quality
in people; I sense it in you.

561
00:23:36,166 --> 00:23:37,458
[KIRIGIRI] Of course,
there's always the chance

562
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,083
I'm reading too
much into things.

563
00:23:39,166 --> 00:23:41,166
But for your sake,
I hope I'm not.

564
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:44,125
Y'expect me to just "push
through" the death of a friend?

565
00:23:44,208 --> 00:23:47,083
If that's what you're talking
about, then I'm not your guy.

566
00:23:48,291 --> 00:23:51,625
[NAEGI] When someone I care
about dies, I don't move on.

567
00:23:51,708 --> 00:23:53,875
I carry it with me...

568
00:23:53,958 --> 00:23:55,166
Forever...

569
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:57,458
It's who I am...

570
00:23:57,541 --> 00:23:59,916
Maizono and Kuwata's deaths...

571
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,333
I'm not sweepin'
'em under the rug.

572
00:24:02,416 --> 00:24:04,916
I'm not the type
who just forgets.

573
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,916
If I get out of here,
I'll still be haunted by 'em!

574
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,125
I'll always look back!

575
00:24:10,208 --> 00:24:11,500
How noble...

576
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:14,333
A difficult path, but noble...

577
00:24:14,416 --> 00:24:15,125
Still, though...

578
00:24:15,208 --> 00:24:16,833
I have hope.

579
00:24:18,416 --> 00:24:21,583
So... While I'm here, and
it may be silly to ask...

580
00:24:21,666 --> 00:24:24,416
What precisely keyed you in to
the fact that I'd popped by

581
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,500
to speak with you about Maizono?

582
00:24:26,583 --> 00:24:28,708
[NAEGI] Oh, I can
read your mind.

583
00:24:28,791 --> 00:24:30,500
[KIRIGIRI gasps]

584
00:24:30,583 --> 00:24:31,791
[NAEGI] Kidding...

585
00:24:31,875 --> 00:24:33,250
Intuition.
