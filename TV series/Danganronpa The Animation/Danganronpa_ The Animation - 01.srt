00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:21,791
I do, yes.

332
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:23,625
Considering one or more of you
might already be planning

333
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:25,791
my untimely demise.

334
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:26,958
Oh, come on.

335
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:28,958
Only a fool would deny it.

336
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:30,458
Whoa there, pal!

337
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:32,291
You can't just do
whatever you want!

338
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:33,000
Hmph.

339
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:34,750
Out of my way, narwhal.

340
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:38,041
Ooh, your paranoia's
'bout to be right-on.

341
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:39,500
[NAEGI] Hold up, guys!

342
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:41,500
The last thing we
wanna do is fight!

343
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:43,125
Say what?!

344
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:45,000
The hell d'you think
you are, punk?!

345
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:47,000
You wanna lecture me?

346
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:49,833
Gimme a lesson on teamwork?!

347
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:51,000
No, I--!

348
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:52,708
Shut up!

349
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:04,375
[NAEGI] Where am I...?

350
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,875
Maizono!

351
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:10,375
Hey, welcome back.

352
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:12,250
Wait, are we, still...?

353
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:12,958
'Fraid so.

This is your room.

355

[MAIZONO] Everybody gets
their own, apparently.

356
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:20,041
I got Ohgami and the others
to carry you in here.

357
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:21,833
Hope you don't mind.

358
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:23,041
No. No.

359
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:24,625
Are they...?

360
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:27,458
They've been tearing the school
apart for the past couple hours.

361
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:28,666
I stayed to--

362
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:31,583
I mean, I was worried
about you and all...

363
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:32,916
That's really sweet.

364
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,625
Wow. Thank you, I guess.

365
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,958
[NAEGI] Back when
life was normal,

366
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:39,458
Maizono used to be a big deal.

367
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:41,208
Big enough that you
wouldn't think she'd bother

368
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:44,083

369
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:45,875
Oh, don't be like that.

Was-Was that out loud?!

371
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:49,708
No. I can read your mind.

372
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:50,500
Huh?!

373
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:51,541
[MAIZONO giggles]

374
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:52,625
Teasing again!

375
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:53,875
Girl's intuition.

376
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:55,166
[NAEGI laughs]

377
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:56,791
[NAEGI] Sorta the
same thing, isn't it...?

378
00:15:56,875 --> 00:15:59,041
Look, I'm really
glad you're here.

379
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:01,000
Be a lot worse if
I didn't know anyone.

380
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:02,458
Y-Yeah.

381
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:05,250
[NAEGI] Here we go...

382
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:07,125
[MAIZONO] How you
feeling? Better?

383
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:08,500
[NAEGI] You bet!

384
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:10,416
'Sides, I'm not about to be
the only one lying down

385
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,000
while everyone else is
busting their humps

386
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:13,458
lookin' for an escape.

387
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:17,250
Yeah! You've got a good point.

388
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:18,750
Guess that cinches it, then.

389
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:21,083
If you're joining the search,
you'll need a Gal Friday.

390
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:22,250
Huh?

391
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:24,708
Someone who's got
your back, silly boy!

392
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:26,125
C'mon, it'll be great!

393
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:27,625
We'll be like detectives!

394
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:29,083
Uh...

395
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:34,666
Oh! Oh, hey! There's
the man of the hour!

396
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:35,541
You okay?

397
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:37,250
[NAEGI] Sure am! Never better.

398
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:39,541
So, Let's chalk the
whole thing up to stress.

399
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:41,541
Uh, yeah,
no worries Ohwada.

400
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:43,041
I mean, we're all on edge.

401
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:44,916
Tempers flare up sometimes.

402
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,708
I doubt any of us would kill
in front of witnesses.

403
00:16:47,791 --> 00:16:49,666
That is to say, under present
circumstances

404
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,833
"safety in numbers"
would seem to hold true.

405
00:16:51,916 --> 00:16:53,250
Right, listen up!

406
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:55,458
I hereby call to order the first
Hope's Peak High School

407
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:58,625
Reconnaissance Committee
Briefing on Academy Affairs.

408
00:16:58,708 --> 00:17:01,041
Let's review the
present state of our intel.

409
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:03,750
And remember,
all cards on the table!

410
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:06,166
[OHWADA] I kicked at the
stupid door for an hour.

411
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:07,041
Nothing.

412
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:08,833
Didn't leave so much as a dent.

413
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:10,166
Thing's hard as iron.

414
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:12,833
[CELESTIA] It is iron,
so that makes sense.

415
00:17:12,916 --> 00:17:14,333
[OHGAMI] At the end
of the main corridor,

416
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:17,041
we found a stairwell
leading to an upper floor.

417
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:18,291
[ASAHINA] But the
security gate was down

418
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:20,375
and we couldn't get it to budge.

419
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:21,791
I see...

420
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:23,458
It is interesting that
certain areas of the facility

421
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:26,208
are evidently out of
bounds for the time being.

422
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:28,416
[YAMADA] The dorm rooms
are actually quite nice.

423
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,333
Firm beds, good lighting,
stylish decor.

424
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:33,375
Except for the iron plates and
surveillance cameras,

425
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:36,208
I'd give 'em five stars.

426
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:37,791
[FUJISAKI] I searched
the kitchen.

427
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:40,000
They've got enough food packed
in the fridge to feed an army.

428
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:41,833
Safe to say we won't go hungry.

429
00:17:41,916 --> 00:17:44,708
[YAMADA] Surely there's not
enough to feed fifteen people

430
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:46,541
for the rest of their lives?

431
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:47,750
[FUJISAKI] No, there is.

432
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:49,625
The fridge gets
restocked every day

433
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:52,291
according to how much
we've eaten the day prior.

434
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:54,583
See, Monokuma told me so.

435
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:56,541
Wha--? You saw 'im?

436
00:17:56,625 --> 00:17:58,750
He popped up out of
nowhere while I was looking

437
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:00,500
around the kitchen,
then disappeared

438
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:02,500
before I could
see where he went.

439
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:03,500
[ISHIMARU] Ahem.

440
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,541
Anything else
to report?

441
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:07,375
[FUKAWA "Report."
We're still in the dark

442
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:09,666
about who's behind all this,
and we're still trapped.

443
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:11,750
This investigation
was a waste of time!

444
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:13,291
No...

445
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,791
Some useful information was
gleaned from our joint effort.

446
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:18,708
We now know the
boundaries of our confinement

447
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:20,583
And that we'll be
here for a while.

448
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:21,916
[FUKAWA screams]

449
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,541
Stop! I'm having a
nervous breakdown!

450
00:18:24,625 --> 00:18:26,041
Monokuma's made that
perfectly clear.

451
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:28,583
From where else should the
incentive come for us to kill?

452
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:30,375
That's not something
to joke about!

453
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:32,708
Oh, man! What are we gonna do?

454
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:34,291
Adapt, I suppose.

455
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:35,375
What?

456
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:37,291
These aren't such
bad arrangements.

457
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:40,000
So we just suck it up?
Get used to being prisoners?

458
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:41,458
In the game of survival,

459
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:44,291
neither the strongest nor
smartest have the advantage.

460
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:47,083
But rather those most
willing and able to adapt.

461

With that chestnut in mind,

464
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:54,416
I would like to offer everyone,
if I may, a modest suggestion.

465
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,375
Yeah? And what would that be?

466
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:58,833
You will note in the

Observe.

468
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:02,958
Why not make an addendum to
these so-called "night hours"?

469
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:04,708
Like what, exactly?

470
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:06,541
At night we all
stay in our rooms.

471
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:08,291
Simple as that.

472
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:09,166
What?

473
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,333
What would even be the point?

474
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:11,791
Think about it, my dears.

475
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:13,916
Given this predicament,
the dark hours

476
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,750
will be especially hard
on our nerves as it is.

477
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:20,041
The tiniest sound will persuade
us of foulness afoot.

00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:22,833
Now.

479
00:19:22,916 --> 00:19:23,791
Needless to say,
this restriction

480
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:25,583
must be
self-imposed.

481
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:28,375
Its only means of enforcement
will be peer pressure.

482

[NAEGI] The next day we picked
up where the search left off.

And the day after that...

484
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,791
But, as you've probably figured,
we didn't make a lot of headway.

We're stuck.

492
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:58,000
We're never getting out of here.

493
00:19:58,083 --> 00:19:59,666
No one's coming to help us.

494

Aw, chin up, Fujisaki!

495
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:05,708
Someone on the outside's bound
to start missin' us soon.

496
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:07,125
Yes! Of course!

497
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:08,041
You think so?

498
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:09,458
Huh?

499
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:11,500
Well, we've been gone long
enough to raise the alarm.

500
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:13,083
We're talkin' three days!

501
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:15,625
The police are bound to be
closing the net on this place!

[MONOKUMA] Dear, oh dear.

505
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:23,875
You're not hedging your
bets on law enforcement?

506
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:25,625
You know,
it's quite simple.

507
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:26,958
If you want out of here,

508
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:29,333
all I gotta see is
a little initiative.

[MONOKUMA] Hyuck.

511
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:34,916
Well, I've gotta hand
it to you Generation Z-er's,

512
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,750
you've got balls when it comes
to dealing with authority.

513
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:40,291
Frankly though, that
attitude only goes so far.

514
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:41,791
You're borin' me to tears.

515

If you think you can
trick us into killing someone,

516
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:45,208
you're crazier than I thought!

517
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:47,625
[MONOKUMA] Eureka!

518
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:49,250
That's the problem!

519
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:52,333
Granted, my setup's perfect:
the right atmosphere,

520
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:54,125
a good balance of
tension and intrigue,

521
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:56,208
the perfect amount of pressure,

522
00:20:56,291 --> 00:20:59,000
but not the vital ingredient
to bring it all together!

523
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:00,916
What are you gettin'
at, buddy bear?

524

[MONOKUMA] Motivation, son!

for a brief,
informative presentation

527
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:10,333
on just what I mean.

528
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:11,791
Multimedia Room?

529
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:26,666
Oh, my.

Where in the world do I start?

We're just so unbelievably
proud of you, Naegi darling!

You'll do great!

It's a pretty big deal,
buckaroo. Ha, ha!

You know, don't work too hard.

there little bro!

of your luck!

No!

I can't do this.

I have... I have to get out
of here before it's too late!

[MAIZONO] Why...?

549
00:22:11,541 --> 00:22:13,333
Why did this happen?

550
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:15,208
I didn't deserve this.

Yeah, who are you, really?

00:22:24,458 --> 00:22:26,625
And what are you
getting out of this?

556
00:22:26,708 --> 00:22:29,541
Is this all some kind
of sick game to you?

557
00:22:29,625 --> 00:22:32,708
[MONOKUMA] Yes, what am I
getting out of this?

558
00:22:32,791 --> 00:22:35,583
Very good question.

that happen, I swear!
