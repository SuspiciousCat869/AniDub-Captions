[NAEGI "School Life of Mutual
Killing."

00:00:17,375 --> 00:00:20,000
Reality TV's latest smash.

3
00:00:20,083 --> 00:00:21,750
Starring yours truly.

4
00:00:22,833 --> 00:00:25,250
[NAEGI] Who's behind
this, and why?

5
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:27,875
And for the record, let
me just say how bunk it is

6
00:00:27,958 --> 00:00:30,500
that we have hold another stupid
trial when none of us knows

7
00:00:30,583 --> 00:00:32,250
what the hell is going on.

8
00:00:33,541 --> 00:00:35,666
[NAEGI] Kirigiri's
okay at least.

9
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:38,875

more than likely Student X,

a.k.a. Mukuro Ikusaba.

11
00:00:44,291 --> 00:00:45,708
[NAEGI] The trick
now of course,

12
00:00:45,791 --> 00:00:47,875
is exposing the
murderer of someone

13
00:00:47,958 --> 00:00:50,166
we know absolutely
nothing about...

14

[NAEGI] Kirigiri...

16
00:01:00,583 --> 00:01:02,083
Where were you this whole time?

17
00:01:02,166 --> 00:01:03,708
The second floor dormitory.

18
00:01:03,791 --> 00:01:05,625
The key I showed you
was a skeleton key

19
00:01:05,708 --> 00:01:08,291
that opens any door on campus.

20
00:01:08,375 --> 00:01:10,041
The details will
have to wait.

21
00:01:10,125 --> 00:01:11,583
At the moment I'm hyper-focused

22
00:01:11,666 --> 00:01:13,791
on getting out of
this trial alive.

23
00:01:13,875 --> 00:01:15,541
The odds are against me.

24
00:01:15,625 --> 00:01:18,583
I apologize in advance for
anything I might say or do.

Who wants to put their
foot in their mouth first?

27
00:03:01,458 --> 00:03:04,083
Without a doubt, the
murderer is Kirigiri!

30
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,166
Can you prove it?!

31
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:12,541
[TOGAMI] Point one: the body
was discovered at 9 A.M.

32
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:14,125
[FUKAWA] I can vouch for that.

33
00:03:14,208 --> 00:03:15,666
I'm the one who found it.

34
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:18,791
I'd gone to the garden to find a
mattock for Master Togami,

35
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:20,500
and hello corpse.

36
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:22,208
[TOGAMI] This
establishes a timeline

37
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:24,416
because we know the body
wasn't there at 10 o'clock

38
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,708
the previous night.

39
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:27,125
[HAGAKURE] Seems legit.

40
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:29,375
That's when you and I
checked out the gardens last.

41
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:31,333
[KIRIGIRI] Then the
murder occurred sometime

42
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:33,125
between ten o'clock
last night

43
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:35,583
and nine o'clock
this morning, correct?

44
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:38,375
[TOGAMI] Yes. Point two:
parting ways with Hagakure

45
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:40,958
shortly after 10 P.M.,
I wandered into the gym,

46
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:43,833
where I happened upon
an inanimate Monokuma.

47
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:47,458
Within moments I'd summoned
Hagakure, Fukawa and Asahina,

48
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:49,541
and the four of us
spent the entire window

49
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:51,458
attempting to
reverse engineer him.

50
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:54,041
Meaning everyone
present has an alibi.

51
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:57,583
Everyone, that is, except
you, Kyoko Kirigiri.

52
00:03:57,666 --> 00:04:00,583
Just for clarification, I
notice no mention of Naegi

53
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:01,458
in that scenario.

54
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:02,291
[NAEGI gasps]

55
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:03,458
Hmph.

56
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:05,500
The sprinkler system
exonerates the boy.

57
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:09,125
You see, the garden is watered
at approximately 7:30 A.M.

58
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:11,000
The body, however,
was not wet.

59
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:13,125
Ergo, we may conclude
it was placed there

60
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:14,708
after the sprinklers shut off.

61
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:17,083
This gives Naegi
an ironclad alibi,

62
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:19,125
as he was with us
in the gym by then,

63
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:21,250
poring over the
inert Monokuma.

64
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:23,416
It also further
restricts the timeline

65
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,666
to between 7:30 and 9 A.M.

66
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,583
[KIRIGIRI] There's an
inconsistency in your account,

67
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:29,791
I'm afraid: The
body was in fact wet.

68
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:30,833
[TOGAMI] Ah. Yes, that.

69
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:32,416
Only the top half however,

70
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,791
and then only after
we'd discovered it.

71
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,583
The body burst
into flames.

72
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:38,250
All of us, including Naegi,

73
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:40,458
doused it in an effort to
preserve the evidence.

74
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:44,375
Before this, the carcass was,
except for the blood, bone dry.

75
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:47,000
Oh my! Wet on top,
and dry on bottom!

76
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:49,458
Internet Rule 34,
don't fail me now!

77
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:50,875
[KIRIGIRI] Ah...

78
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:52,916
So in other words, the sprinkler
system had nothing to do

79
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,166
with the body being wet.

80
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,041
Still...

81
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:56,375
That being said,

82
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:59,208
this doesn't restrict us
to between 7:30 and 9 A.M.

83
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:00,708
What are you getting at?

84
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:03,125
[KIRIGIRI] Suppose the murderer
covered his or her victim

85
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:04,000
with a vinyl tarp.

86
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:05,583
A clever misdirection.

87
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:08,583
It also reopens our timeline
to between 10 last night,

88
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:10,541
after you and
Hagakure parted ways,

89
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:13,291
and 9 A.M., when
the body was found.

90
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:14,916
In fact, we needn't suppose.

91
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,958
I'm certain this is
what the killer did.

92
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:19,291
My own investigation
uncovered such a tarp

93
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:20,416
in the garden shed.

94
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,291
Meaning...

95
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:24,500
Naegi's alibi isn't so ironclad.

96
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:25,416
[NAEGI] Wait...

97
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,541
Does...

98
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:30,041
Does she think I'm
the one who did it?!

99
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:31,125
[MONOKUMA] Woo-hoo, doggie!

100
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:33,000
Look at lavender locks go!

101
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:36,083
When it's balls to the wall,
she don't screw around, huh?

102
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:38,500
Lack of alibi isn't
the only factor.

103
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:41,333
The choice of weapon used
to kill this Mukuro Ikusaba

104
00:05:41,416 --> 00:05:43,208
points incontrovertibly
at you as well.

105
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:44,708
Wait, I'm not
following you;

106
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:45,916
it was just a knife, right?

107
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,375
Any of us could've used that.

108
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:49,666
The knife was a red herring...

109
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,416
A mere decoy.

110
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,125
Think back to the blood.

111
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:55,166
Had the stab wound
been what did her in,

112
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:57,875
surely we'd have seen some
on the ground around her.

113
00:05:57,958 --> 00:06:00,583
The murderer spattered the
lab coat prior to the deed

114
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:03,291
and dressed the body
to misdirect us.

115
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:05,958
I noted one of the chickens
missing from the coop.

116
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:09,666
Doubtless the blood was provided
care of an unfortunate fowl.

117
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,000
Dudes, check it out!

118
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:13,625
The Monokuma Files say
the body "showed signs of

119
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:15,625
blunt force trauma to
the back of the head,

120
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,666
consistent with a metal
pipe or cud-gel",

121
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,125
whatever that's
supposed to be...

122
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:21,375
There you have it: in the
garden with a lead pipe!

123
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:23,166
Kindly stop trying
to think, please.

124
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,541
I've already discovered
the weapon myself.

125

[NAEGI gasps]

126
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:28,875
It was in fact a quiver
of duralumin arrows

127
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:30,208
I found in a dojo locker.

128
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:31,708
[HAGAKURE] What? Gimme a break!

129
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:34,500
Arrows are for piercing,
not blunt force trauma!

130
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:35,500
[TOGAMI] Au contraire.

131
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:37,666
Taped together, they'd be ideal.

132
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:40,333
And it so happens, the
quiver of arrows in question

133
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:41,958
were held together
with a length

134
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:43,958
of blood-spattered
masking tape.

135
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:46,083
The easy explanation?

136
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:48,666
Kyoko Kirigiri is the killer!

137
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,458
[NAEGI gasps]

138
00:06:50,541 --> 00:06:51,916
[KIRIGIRI] Well played...

139
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,375
There's just one problem:
I've never been to the dojo.

140
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:55,875
[TOGAMI] Ah, yes.

141
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:58,416
Naturally you'd claim as much
in your position, however.

142
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:02,500
Evidence refuting that claim
was found in your room.

143
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:05,166
Specifically the
dojo locker's key.

144
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:09,166
I'm being framed...

145
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:10,375
you have to see that...

146
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:11,583
Nix the charade!

147
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:13,708
You've been painted
into a corner! Confess!

148
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:15,291
[KIRIGIRI] I think not.

149
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:18,125
You of everyone here should know
better than to pin this on me.

150
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:19,666
Hm?

151
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:22,333
Your room key.
I demand you relinquish it.

152
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,291
[KIRIGIRI] It stands
to reason, does it not?

153
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:27,625
Without the key, I don't
have access to my room.

154
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:28,500
Period.

155
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:30,708
[NAEGI] Wait. That isn't true...

156
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:32,875
She just contradicted herself...

157
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:34,208
She's lying...

158
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:36,250
I'm sure of it...

159
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:38,166
The key I showed you
was a skeleton key

160
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,083
that opens any door on campus.

161
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:42,416
[NAEGI] She did have
access to her room.

162
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,666
She all but told me outright.

163
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,416
Why lie?

164
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,166
What is she hiding?

165
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:49,833
Oh, Kiri...

166
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:52,125
[TOGAMI] I don't imagine you
care to offer us a theory

167
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:53,875
as to how Naegi
came to find the key

168
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:56,291
to the dojo locker in your room?

169
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:59,875
A reasonably vital question
to satisfy, I think.

170
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:02,166
This is ridiculous.
Can't you see?

171
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:05,250
Execute me and the school
remains a mystery.

172
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:06,625
I'm sorry...

173
00:08:06,708 --> 00:08:09,250
I cannot allow that to happen.

174
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:16,375
What is she...?

175
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:18,375
[KIRIGIRI] It's
risky... I know...

176
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:21,000
But if it means exposing
this place for what it is,

177
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:22,500
so be it.

178
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:24,958
[NAEGI] She must have her
reasons for holding out on us.

179
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:26,833
She's worked too hard...

180
00:08:26,916 --> 00:08:28,750
To hell with it, I trust her!

181
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:31,041
Kiri's not a
cold-blooded killer!

182
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:32,041
[TOGAMI] Really!

183
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:33,666
So you do nothing
in your defense

184
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,666
but stare dejectedly
at the floor!

185
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:38,791
[MONOKUMA] Ugh.

186
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:41,041
What a friggin' snooze fest;
get the lead out, people!

187
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:43,958
Kirigiri's the
clear choice, yeah?

188
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:45,500
So carpe diem!

189
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:49,625
Cast your votes and send Jessica
Fletcher Junior to her doom!

190
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:51,083
[NAEGI] Hold on!

191
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,791
[MONOKUMA] Yeah...?

192
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:58,041
I can't exactly put
my finger on it...

193
00:08:58,125 --> 00:08:59,833
but this trial seems off.

194
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:01,083
[MONOKUMA] Really?

195
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:02,166
[NAEGI] It's just...

196
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,083
Doesn't it feel weird
to anyone else

197
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:06,125
that we're forced to have one
when we don't even know

198
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:07,291
for sure who the victim was?

199
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:08,458
I mean, come on...

200
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:10,541
We oughta have more
time to investigate.

201
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:13,166
[HAGAKURE] Um, hello: the
victim was that Ikusaba chick.

202
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:15,125
Yeah, but we're just
assuming that, aren't we?

203
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:16,500
We don't really know.

204
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:19,416
There ya go bringin'
logic into this.

205
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,958
You see?

206
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:23,250
And yet here we are, expected to
make an instant decision...

207
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:24,666
What the hell, guys?

208
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,000
Monokuma!

209
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:27,791
You're trying to pull one
over on us, aren't you?

210
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:28,750
[MONOKUMA] Moi?

211
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:30,125
O-ho!

212
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:32,958
Methinks the screechy kid
doth protest too much!

213
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:36,708
You know what they say:
the guiltier, the chattier.

214
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:38,291
[NAEGI gasps]

215
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:39,000
[MONOKUMA] All right!

216
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:40,250
Enough fartin' around!

217
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:41,708
Time's officially up!

218
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:43,708
Debate and
deliberation are over.

219
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:45,625
Feel free to shut your traps.

220
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:47,458
In fact, please do.

221
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:48,166
But...

222
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,250
we're not done yet...

223
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:50,166
We still need to--

224
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:51,375
[MONOKUMA] Calling all votes!

225
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:53,916
You know how this works
by now, troopers!

226
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,416
Let your fingers do the talkin'!

227
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,750
No! Wait--

228
00:09:57,833 --> 00:09:59,416
[KIRIGIRI] It's my
understanding Naegi was the one

229
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,000
to find the locker key, yes?

230
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:04,000
Mightn't he have planted it to
deflect suspicion from himself?

231
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:06,125
Wha...

232
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:08,333
W-What are you saying...?

233
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:10,750
[KIRIGIRI] If I can't enter
my room as I please...

234
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:13,208
I'm afraid that's the only
plausible explanation.

235
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:14,458
Then... oh dear!

236
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:17,666
That means he's the murderer!

237
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:18,791
[NAEGI] That isn't true...!

238
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:20,625
[MONOKUMA] Less talkie,
more votie!

239
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:22,416
[NAEGI] Damn it, it wasn't me!

240
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:35,250
[NAEGI] This...

241
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:37,833
This isn't happening...

242
00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:39,458
This whole trial...

243
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:42,708
This whole trial is a setup!

244
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:44,791
Are you people out
of your minds?!

245
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:46,916
We didn't have enough
time to decide!

246
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,541
It's a sham!

247
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:50,000
We're being played!

248
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:52,666
[MONOKUMA] Button, button;
who's got the button?

249
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,375
Oh, yeah. I do!

250
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:56,666
Punishment time!

251
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,208
[MONOKUMA] What the...?

252
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:40,500
Excuse me?!

253
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:41,041
Wha...

254
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:42,208
What was that?

255
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:44,000
What in the hell was that?!

256
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:46,625
Did you... see
what I just saw?

257
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:50,333
I, uh... I think so, yeah.

258
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:52,958
Damn it all, I knew
Naegi wasn't guilty!

259
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:55,875
[MONOKUMA] I've been hacked...

260
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:58,541
Son of a mother,
I've been hacked!

261
00:12:58,625 --> 00:13:02,625
Digi-Fujisaki planted a virus
when it infiltrated the network!

262
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:05,708
He's made a mockery
of this fine institution!

263
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:08,583
Suppose things don't
always go according to plan.

264
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:10,833
[MONOKUMA] Huh...

265
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:13,000
Maybe they don't.

266
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:15,958
Then again maybe starving
to death in a basement

267
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:19,041
piled with rotting garbage
is precisely the punishment

268
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:21,250
I had in mind for
the snot nose punk!

269
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:27,083
[MONOKUMA cackles]

270
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:40,166
[NAEGI] Where am I?

271
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:46,916
Man that was close...

272
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,250
Alter Ego saved me...

273
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:51,916
Well, best not to waste
a new lease on life!

274
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:55,916
[NAEGI] Now how do
I get out of here?

275
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:02,166
[NAEGI sniffs]

276
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,000
Ew. No thanks.

277
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:07,375
[NAEGI] Even the
water's gone bad...

278
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:13,208
If you think I'm just
gonna sit on my ass

279
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:16,208
waitin' to die, you
are sorely mistaken!

280
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:22,375
[NAEGI] Gotta...

281
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:24,166
conserve my energy.

282
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:32,833
[crashing]

283
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:34,291
[NAEGI gasps]

284
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:36,708
[NAEGI] What... the hell...?

285
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:38,458
[KIRIGIRI grunts]

286
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:40,500
[KIRIGIRI] Yeah, don't
help me or anything.

287
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:42,541
Kiri! How'd you get here?

288
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:45,041
[KIRIGIRI] You're faring
better than anticipated.

289
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:46,708
[NAEGI] Um, what're you doing?

290
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:48,208
Call it a rescue mission.

291
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:50,791
One I thought would
be fairly obvious.

292
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:56,000
[NAEGI] You've, uh...

293
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:57,666
You got a thing on your head.

294
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:00,166
You need to eat.

295
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:01,958
We'll talk after.

296
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:08,833
You're a life saver!

297
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:11,250
And just like that,
he's back at full throttle.

298
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:13,166
Well, I don't know
about all that, but...

299
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:16,916
I guess bein' rescued does
kinda put a spring in my step.

300
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:22,458
I owed it you.

301
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:24,750
It's the least I could do after
throwing you under the bus

302
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:26,916
to further my own agenda.

303
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,041
[NAEGI] No worries.

304
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:32,166
It's not like you're the one
who got us into this nightmare.

305
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:34,333
None of this is your fault.

306
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:40,166
[KIRIGIRI] Listen...

307
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:42,833
There's something you need
to know about Ikusaba.

308
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:45,416
She was murdered in
someone else's place.

309
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,500
Yours.

310
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:48,166
Whaddya mean?!

311
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:49,875
[KIRIGIRI] Don't you remember?

312
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,875
The guy with the
mask and the knife.

313
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:53,791
That...

314
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:55,791
wasn't a dream
the other night?

315
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:58,125
Holy crap, you actually
saved my life!

316
00:15:58,208 --> 00:15:59,416
Naegi...

317
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,541
The mastermind originally
intended to frame me

318
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:03,333
for your murder...

319
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:05,625
I was getting too
close to the truth.

320
00:16:05,708 --> 00:16:06,916
Of course.

321
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,458
But since he didn't
kill me for some reason...

322
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:11,583
...he used a different body
to achieve the same ends.

323
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:14,416
I've been a thorn in his side...

324
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,458
He's been chomping at
the bit for an excuse

325
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:19,083
to get me out of the way before
I undermine the whole system.

326
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:20,583
You singled yourself out...

327
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:23,416
Defending me and questioning the
circumstances of the trial

328
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:27,208
forced the mastermind's hand:
you had to go, too.

329
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:29,083
Hence the sudden
change of plans.

330
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:32,458
Why he rushed everyone to a
decision at the last minute.

331
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:33,458
[KIRIGIRI] Indeed...

332
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:34,958
He's falling back
on cheap tricks

333
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:36,666
because we've got
him on the run.

334
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:40,666
We're on the verge of bringing
down this house of cards.

335
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,125
For now, though...

336
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:44,458
I suggest we focus on
getting out of here.

337
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:45,541
I agree...

338
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:47,708
Trouble is we're locked in.

339
00:16:47,791 --> 00:16:49,166
Are we now?

340
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:09,125
[NAEGI screams]

341
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:15,333
Watch your step.

342
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:17,125
If you fall, I won't
be able to catch you

343
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:18,166
and it's a long way down.

344
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:19,625
[NAEGI] Thanks.

345
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:36,083
[KIRIGIRI] My, uh...

346
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:38,208
My memories are coming back.

347
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:39,791
Piecemeal...

348
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:42,458
but enough to give me a decent
working conception of my past.

349
00:17:42,541 --> 00:17:43,708
[NAEGI] Yeah?

350
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:46,250
Apparently, there's a
term for my skill set.

351
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:48,625
In this school's
particular jargon

352
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:52,625
I'm called a "Super High
School-Level Detective."

353
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:56,291
"Detective"... seems obvious
now that you say it...

354
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:58,458
[KIRIGIRI] Hence, the
mastermind sees me as a threat:

355
00:17:58,541 --> 00:18:01,458
I'm uniquely
qualified to expose him.

356
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:04,916
It's why he brainwashed
me erasing my past life.

357
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,458
Yeah, makes sense.

358
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:08,750
I mean anyone who spends more
than ten minutes with you

359
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:10,375
can see you've got
sleuthing in your blood.

360
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:11,916
Thank you...

361
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,666
I pinned my hopes on recruitment
officers noticing that too.

362
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:17,458
I busted my tail to get here.

363
00:18:17,541 --> 00:18:19,875
Dad left when I was little.

364
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:23,291
I had this ridiculous fantasy
of reuniting with him...

365
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:25,583
Figured if my application
crossed his desk,

366
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:27,125
he'd simply have
to deal with me.

367
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:30,000
Wait a sec, your
father's the principal!

368
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:31,583
[KIRIGIRI] Yes.

369
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:33,791
[NAEGI] Is that the reason you
don't buy into the principal

370
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:35,833
and the mastermind
bein' the same guy?

371
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:46,750
[NAEGI grunts]

372
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:51,000
[NAEGI] The incinerator!

373
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:52,500
We made it!

374
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:53,500
[KIRIGIRI] Finally.

375
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:55,541
So, now what're
we s'posed to do?

376
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:57,375
We have a talk
with Monokuma.

377
00:18:57,458 --> 00:18:58,666
[MONOKUMA] For realsies?!

378
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:00,375
Why is he alive?!

379
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:02,500
Do executions mean nothing?!

380
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:04,375
You saved him, didn't you?

381
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:06,583
I knew this would happen!

382
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:08,541
Sorry, is that
against the rules?

383
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:10,541
[MONOKUMA] I should
say so, young lady!

384
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:12,208
Once the turkey's trussed,

385
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:14,083
there's no putting
'im back in the yard!

386
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:16,125
A death sentence
is a death sentence!

387
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:18,125
No interference
will be tolerated!

388
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:20,791
Back to the Death Chamber
with you, Naegi!

389
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:21,583
[KIRIGIRI] Huh...

390
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:22,541
Whatever floats your boat.

391
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:23,250
What?!

392
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:24,666
Except that...

393
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,208
Well, not that I'd know, but...

394
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:28,166
won't your viewers feel cheated?

395
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,750
[MONOKUMA] Beg pardon?

396
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:32,000
[KIRIGIRI] Consider the nature
of your programming...

397
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:34,625
You're catering to a
jaded audience as it is.

398
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:37,500
I imagine they want to see
you beat us fair and square.

399
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:40,166
Keep pulling a bait-and-switch
every time things look rough

400
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:41,500
for your higher-ups,

401
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:43,500
and the ratings are bound
to eventually plummet.

402
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:47,291
Sorry... Dirty tricks
will never persuade

403
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:48,958
your viewership
that hope is dead.

404
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:50,625
[MONOKUMA] Oh dear...

405
00:19:50,708 --> 00:19:52,250
[KIRIGIRI] I have
a proposal for you.

406
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:54,583
Reopen the case
of Mukuro Ikusaba.

407
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:55,958
Let us hold a re-trial.

408
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:56,958
No tricks.

409
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:58,958
No manipulating the outcome.

410
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:00,375
[MONOKUMA hyucks]

411
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:02,333
Consider it the final
battle, if you like...

412
00:20:02,416 --> 00:20:05,166
Hope against Despair.

413
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:06,250
[MONOKUMA laughs]

414
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:07,583
[KIRIGIRI] Come now...

415
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:10,458
There's no denying your
audience would eat it up.

416
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:13,541
[MONOKUMA laughs]

417
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:14,875
[MONOKUMA] Fascinating.

418
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:16,875
"Beary" fascinating...

419
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:18,208
R-Really?

420
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:19,541
[MONOKUMA] I have to admit,

421
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:21,791
it would be a great
change of pace.

422
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:23,041
Ah, what the hell!

423
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:24,666
Challenge accepted!

424
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:27,083
With the caveat that we
give your grand finale

425
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:29,291
a li'l more kick. Can't
just go with the whole

426
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:32,125
"and the murderer is"
routine, eh?

427
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:33,291
No, no!

428
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:35,458
An epic showdown of these
proportions

429
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:38,541
calls for some high
stakes razzle dazzle!

430
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:40,291
What did you have in mind?

431
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:43,500
[MONOKUMA] Disentangle the
secrets of this fine institution

432
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:45,416
and I'll concede defeat...

433
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,958
You and your surviving
cohorts walk free.

434
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:49,041
[NAEGI gasps]

435
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:50,291
And the catch?

436
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:53,208
[MONOKUMA] Fail to solve
the mystery, however...

437
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:57,041
[KIRIGIRI] ...and every last one
of us gets executed, naturally.

438
00:20:57,125 --> 00:20:58,291
[MONOKUMA] They don't call you a

439
00:20:58,375 --> 00:21:00,833
Super High School-Level
Detective for nothin'!

440
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:03,208
[MONOKUMA laughs]

441
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:05,166
[MONOKUMA] This'll
be spectacular!

442
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:08,708
Hope doesn't stand a snowball's
chance in Hades against Despair

443
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:10,750
once you rug rats
know the truth!

444
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:12,875
Don't count your chickens
before they're hatched...

445
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:15,166
We may have a few
surprises in store.

446
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:18,208
The despair you keep prattling
about might just be yours.

447
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:21,791
[MONOKUMA laughs]

448
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:25,333
[HAGAKURE] Bogus...

449
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:27,541
We know damn-well
Naegi's not a murderer.

450
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:29,291
But still we convicted him.

451
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:30,666
Which doesn't
make sense,

452
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,708
'cause according to the
rules we should all be dead.

453
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:35,166
[TOGAMI] I think it's safe to
assume the rules have changed.

454
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:37,041
To what, Heaven only knows.

455
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:40,583
[gasping]

456
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:46,416
Dude...

457
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,500
You gotta be kidding me...

458
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:51,416
Look, guys...

459
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,875
It's okay. Really.

460
00:21:53,958 --> 00:21:55,625
We condemned you to death.

461
00:21:55,708 --> 00:21:57,416
[HAGAKURE] Ugh!
You had to put it like that!

462
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,916
Like I don't already
feel like a tool!

463
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,958
We were manipulated.

464
00:22:07,958 --> 00:22:10,416
[NAEGI] The mastermind wants
us at each others throats;

465
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,708
he wants to rob us of hope.

466
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:15,291
And I'll be damned
if I let him win!

467
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:17,625
I like the sound of that!

468
00:22:17,708 --> 00:22:18,541
Nice!

469
00:22:18,625 --> 00:22:20,375
That's what I'm talkin' about!

470
00:22:22,291 --> 00:22:24,041
[TOGAMI] Cryin' out loud...

471
00:22:24,125 --> 00:22:25,416
[HAGAKURE] Brah,
ya smell kinda ripe...

472
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,916
[ASAHINA] What's
wrong with you? Be nice!

473
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,083
[KIRIGIRI] Look sharp.

474
00:22:28,166 --> 00:22:30,416
We have one final
trial on the docket.

475
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:31,500
[gasping]

476
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:33,000
[TOGAMI] What are you
talking about?

477
00:22:33,083 --> 00:22:34,541
Why only one?

478
00:22:34,625 --> 00:22:37,000
Listen: If we get to the bottom

we all go free...

No clue how we're
gonna pull it off, but...

481
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,791
Who cares?

482
00:22:42,875 --> 00:22:45,166
workin' together's gotta
improve our chances, right?

483
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:46,625
Yeah!

"School Life of Mutual Killing"
is now entering

487
00:22:59,041 --> 00:23:02,500
what we'll call the "True
Answer Arc." No holds barred.

All or nothin'.

To get you sniffing
in the right direction,

490
00:23:07,458 --> 00:23:09,125
here's a pointed li'l puzzler:

491
00:23:09,208 --> 00:23:11,541
Why was the number
of students inducted alive

492
00:23:11,625 --> 00:23:13,916
into this facility
capped at sixteen?

493
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,208
Is there some
special significance

494
00:23:16,291 --> 00:23:19,000
tied to that figure?

495
00:23:19,083 --> 00:23:21,083
No worries if you
draw a blank...

496
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:24,500
I'm sure the sweet
hereafter is a ball.
