00:00:18,333 --> 00:00:20,125
[COMM. OFFICER]
The enemy fleet is 300 kedrel

2
00:00:20,208 --> 00:00:23,125
away from the Lobnas Gate.
Estimated time of arrival

3
00:00:23,208 --> 00:00:26,625
in this system:
approximately three hours.

4
00:00:26,708 --> 00:00:29,666
[SPOOR] What's the situation
down on the planet?

5
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:31,625
[KUFADIS] From their latest
report, I'd say they need

6
00:00:31,708 --> 00:00:35,541
another five hours to complete
the evacuation into Plane Space.

7
00:00:35,625 --> 00:00:38,333
So... It seems that
my precious ships

8
00:00:38,416 --> 00:00:41,500
are going to be put in a
dangerous position after all.

9
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:46,166
All ships! Prepare to depart.

10
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,291
At the Lobnas Gate.
Passing through.

11
00:02:28,125 --> 00:02:33,083
[radio chatter]

12
00:02:41,083 --> 00:02:42,333
[KUFADIS]
All ships of the First Fleet

13
00:02:42,416 --> 00:02:44,750
have safely passed
through the Lobnas Gate.

14
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:46,791
[COMM. OFFICER] As planned,
we have 11 patrol ships

15
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:49,958
joining us from
the Altec region.

16
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:52,875
That means we only have 33 ships
if we include the flagship.

17
00:02:52,958 --> 00:02:54,916
[SPOOR] That's weak for a
reconnaissance squadron,

18
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,583
let alone a battle situation.

19
00:02:56,666 --> 00:02:59,041
Chief of Staff.
I want you to assemble

20
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:01,916
thirty of the ships into
five temporary formations.

21
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,250
I want the remaining two ships
to be under our direct control.

22
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:06,708
Roger. Understood.

23
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:08,666
[SPOOR] I find it hard to
believe that we're actually

24
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:11,000
putting so much effort
into trying to save

25
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:14,583
such an insignificant
little system.

26
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:16,791
I agree. It seems crazy.

27
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:19,583
[SPOOR] Keep transmitting
the signal to assemble.

28
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:21,375
[KUFADIS] The ships are now
assembled from numbers

29
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:24,458
one to five in a
temporary formation.

30
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:25,458
[COMM. OFFICER]
The enemy fleet are now

31
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:28,625
less than 200 kedrel away!

32
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:29,958
They're not running?

33
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:30,958
[KUFADIS]
Well, I guess they know

34
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:33,250
they've got a
huge advantage.

35
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:35,750
[SPOOR] It's so humiliating
knowing we have to fight

36
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:38,708
when the odds are
stacked against us like this.

37
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:39,958
[KUFADIS]
I know.

38
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:44,083
[SPOOR] My, my...
The enemy sure seems calm.

39
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:47,333
[KUFADIS] They probably don't
understand what's going on.

40
00:03:47,416 --> 00:03:50,375
Ya think so? I know
just how they feel.

41
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:52,666
[KUFADIS] Here we are
defending the Lobnas Gate,

42
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,875
which has virtually no
strategic importance,

43
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:58,250
with a fleet that has virtually
no chance of winning...

44
00:03:58,333 --> 00:03:59,958
[SPOOR]
I've got it!

45
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:01,250
Chief of Staff.

46
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:03,708
Send a communication
bubble to the enemy fleet!

47
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:05,416
What do you want me to say?

48
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,083
[SPOOR] That this battle is
pointless for both of us.

49
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:10,375
I don't think you need
me to tell you why.

50
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:13,291
It would be irrational for
the enemy fleet to fight.

51
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:15,708
They wouldn't run the risk of
suffering damage just so they

52
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:17,750
could arrive in normal space
a couple of hours sooner

53
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:19,750
than if they waited
for us to leave!

54
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:22,250
Besides, if they don't
understand the situation here,

55
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:24,500
they're going to think that
this Star Forces Commander

56
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:27,166
is stupid! Stupid! Do ya hear?

57
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,125
And I can't bear
the idea of that.

58
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:30,375
I see where you're going.

59
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:32,666
If we could just get the
enemy fleet to hold back

60
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,500
for a few hours,
we'd be out of here

61
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:36,500
and there wouldn't be
any need to fight at all!

62
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:39,458
[SPOOR] The letter should go...
something like this:

63
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:42,208
"I am the Supreme Commander
of Operation Hunter

64
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:46,041
First Fleet, Admiral Spoor.
Our objective is to maintain

65
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:49,291
a presence in the Lobnas Gate
region for a short time.

66
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:51,166
It would be pointless
to oppose us.

67
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,916
Therefore remain in your current
position until we have retreated

68
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,500
from the area."
What do you think about that?

69
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:58,958
It's a good start, but I
think it would be wise

70
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:01,041
to re-word it here and there.

71
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:05,000
Really? Well... I think I'll
let you deal with the details.

72
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:07,041
But we don't have much time!

73
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:08,625
I'll get onto it straight away.

74
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:11,916
This is the First Fleet of the
Star Forces Operation Hunter.

75
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,541
We do not wish to
engage in battle.

76
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:18,375
We promise that we will retreat
from the area in six hours.

77
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:21,166
Therefore we request that
you refrain from advancing

78
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,750
any further.

79
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:26,833
The enemy fleet has
stopped advancing.

80
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:29,875
They've sent back a
communication bubble.

81
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:31,916
"This is the Salai Sector Fleet

82
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,541
of the United Mankind
Peace Corps.

83
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:38,208
We will grant you a grace
period of one hour to retreat."

84
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:40,541
That's all there is.

85
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:42,291
[SPOOR] If we could
retreat that quickly,

86
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:44,708
we wouldn't have had to do
this in the first place.

87
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:48,250
Isn't that obvious to them?

88
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:50,958
Tell them an hour isn't going
to be long enough for us.

89
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:54,000
Tell them we need
at least 24 hours.

90
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:57,041
You can't ask them for 24!
We originally promised them

91
00:05:57,125 --> 00:05:59,583
it would take six hours
for us to retreat!

92
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:00,916
If everything goes
according to plan,

93
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,958
we can be out of here in five.

94
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:05,708
But I'd like 12 so I
can have some leeway.

95
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:09,208
But I thought you just said
to ask for 24 hours, not 12.

96
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:11,625
[SPOOR] You've never worked
in business, have you,

97
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:13,458
Chief of Staff?

98
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:18,041
No, My entire working life I've
been devoted to the Star Forces.

99
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:20,583
Then it's no wonder
you don't understand.

100
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:24,125
In the world of trade, no price
is fixed. Not one. Nope.

101
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:26,916
We're stuck in this situation,
so let's have some fun!

102
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,875
I say we haggle
with our opponent!

103
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:30,583
Right...

104
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:32,291
Ask them for 24 hours.

105
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:33,458
If you say so...

106
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:35,791
[COMM. OFFICER]
We have a reply. Mm...

107
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:38,791
"Your original request
was for six hours.

108
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:43,791
Now you're asking for 24.
Can you explain why?"

109
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:45,333
End of message.

110
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:47,500
[SPOOR] Tell them the original
transmission was a mistake.

111
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:51,875
Make another request for
them to refrain for 24 hours.

112
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:55,000
This might sound rude, but that
enemy commander is an amateur.

113
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:56,458
Negotiations take longer

114
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,416
if they waste time
asking dumb questions.

115
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,708
Perhaps they're not used
to doing business this way.

116
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:02,958
It is a bit unconventional.

117
00:07:03,041 --> 00:07:05,416
And what happens if
they don't give way?

118
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,416
If that happens,
then we have to fight.

119
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,791
Another reply:

120
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:10,625
"We would like an
explanation as to why

121
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:13,041
the time you need has
increased fourfold."

122
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:14,958
When the negotiations
have been finalized,

123
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:17,458
we'll let them know.
Send that to them.

124
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:19,000
Their reply:

125
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:21,875
"We demand to know why you are
being so secretive with us."

126
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:23,291
Tell them that's a secret.

127
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:25,666
[COMM. OFFICER] The reply is:
"We do not recognize you

128
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:28,541
as being a negotiator in
good faith." End of message.

129
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:31,958
So are they saying they want
to end the negotiations?

130
00:07:32,041 --> 00:07:33,416
Ask them that.

131
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,000
That's too confrontational!
If they say yes,

132
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:38,833
then we're going to have a
battle on our hands in no time!

133
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:41,333
The enemy fleet shows
no signs of movement.

134
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:44,291
I'd say that shows they probably
want to avoid a battle.

135
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:46,125
But what if worse
comes to worst?

136
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:49,583
It's sad when an agreement can't
be reached through negotiation.

137
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:52,083
But if you can overcome that
disappointment, you're well

138
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:54,791
on your way to becoming a
successful businessman.

139
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:57,916
This will be a useful
learning experience for you!

140
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,333
I'm in the Star Forces!

141
00:07:59,416 --> 00:08:02,208
I don't want to leave them to
become a businessman!

142
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:04,458
That's such a shame,
my dear Chief of Staff.

143
00:08:04,541 --> 00:08:06,541
Just think of the fun
you'll be missing out on.

144
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:09,500
All that haggling.
Ah well, it's your life,

145
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:12,125
so I suppose I don't have
the right to interfere in it.

146
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:15,083
But right now I'm the one who's
negotiating with these guys.

147
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:17,750
So hurry up and send
them my message.

148
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:19,833
[COMM. OFFICER] Reply:
"We understand your desire

149
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,541
to continue with
the negotiations.

150
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:24,375
We acknowledge your request
for twenty-four hours grace.

151
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:26,791
However, we have decided
that you must still retreat

152
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:29,541
within one hour."
End of message.

153
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:32,458
[SPOOR] Mm! This enemy
commander's very good.

154
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:33,791
[SPOOR chuckles]

155
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:35,166
[KUFADIS] She's enjoying
this little game even more

156
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:36,541
than if she was
actually fighting.

157
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:39,291
[SPOOR] This person has
definitely passed my test

158
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:43,208
as a worthy playmate,
whoever he or she is!

159
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:44,958
[KUFADIS]
How should we reply?

160
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:46,333
[SPOOR] Tell them why
we're still here

161
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:47,791
and why we want more time.

162
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:51,583
Explain it slowly. Take as
much time as possible.

163
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:54,791
You could even juice the
story up a bit, if you like.

164
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:58,416
[KUFADIS] Okay. Where do
you want me to start?

165
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,916
[SPOOR] How about from
when the universe began?

166
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,875
[KUFADIS]
I can't include all that!

167
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:06,458
[SPOOR]
Lighten up, will you?

168
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:09,375
Tell them it's impossible
for us to retreat in an hour.

169
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:11,375
And that we'd be happy to
give them an explanation

170
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:13,291
of our reasons,
if they so desire.

171
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:15,791
We've already managed to
delay them for an extra hour

172
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:17,166
with these questions.

173
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,166
[COMM. OFFICER]
Reply:

174
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:19,875
"We don't want
your explanations.

175
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:21,500
We have our own
reasons for wanting you

176
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:24,958
out of this region, and those
reasons are no concern of yours.

177
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:27,666
We will wait for two more hours,
after which we will advance

178
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,916
and attack anyone
who stands in our path,

179
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,083
with the intention
of obliteration."

180
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:33,833
End of message.

181
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:37,333
Oh well, at least
they're being honest.

182
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:40,416
The enemy commander is
obviously very dedicated.

183
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:44,375
A bit like you,
wouldn't you say, my dear?

184
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:47,583
Mm... Well, I guess we're not
going to get any more time.

185
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:50,083
Do you think they have
a problem with supplies?

186
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:53,916
Probably. That would explain
why they don't want to wait.

187
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,583
If they run out, they'd turn
into space-time particles

188
00:09:56,666 --> 00:09:58,791
scattered across the universe!

189
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:00,833
But they must have some
strength left to fight,

190
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:03,208
otherwise they wouldn't have
threatened to obliterate us.

191
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:05,708
Can't we reduce their
strength even more?

192
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:08,875
Try and extend the negotiations
for as long as possible?

193
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:11,125
Stop whining, you sound
like a sore loser!

194
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:14,833
The skill of negotiating
is knowing when to quit.

195
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:17,583
Um... what message do
you want me to send?

196
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:18,916
[SPOOR]
Let's see...

197
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,208
"Your message has been
received and understood.

198
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:23,750
We will do our utmost to
evacuate the area within

199
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:26,083
two hours but we
may not be successful.

200
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:29,500
I suggest we suspend further
contact to conserve energy."

201
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:31,250
Something like that, anyway.

202
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:32,791
[KUFADIS] How unlike
our Commander in Chief

203
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:35,166
to issue such a
moderate statement!

204
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,333
[SPOOR] We'd better get ready,
Chief of Staff.

205
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:39,625
When they attack,
there'll be no mercy.

206
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:41,166
And we're totally outnumbered.

207
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:45,416
We have to prepare ourselves
for the worst. The very worst.

208
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,916
How I hate this...

209
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,458
[ <i>LASHKAU</i> CREW A]
Fifteen minutes before the enemy

210
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:50,250
fleet advances!

211
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:52,375
[GABORT] This will be the
last trip. Everything depends

212
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:55,083
on how much time Admiral
Spoor can buy us now.

213
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,416
[LAFIEL]
True.

214
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:03,250
Commander! We have an airplane
asking for permission to land.

215
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:06,208
An airplane? Whose is it?
The territorial government's?

216
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:08,500
[ <i>DARKSES</i> OFFICER d] Yes.
The Territorial Representative

217
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:09,791
would like to talk
to Her Highness,

218
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:11,958
the Territorial Ambassador.

219
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:18,958
My name's Tomasof,
the new Representative.

220
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:20,375
It's a pleasure to
meet you in person

221
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:22,625
for the first time, Ambassador.

222
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:25,250
Are you on your own?

223
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:28,458
[TOMASOF]
You might want to see this.

224
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:30,166
Where did you get hold of that?

225
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,458
Well, the rebellion...

226
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:33,916
let's just say it's
become very disorganized.

227
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
[TOMASOF] We thought that in
the chaos, we might be able

228
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:37,916
to determine where the
Deputy Ambassador

229
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,875
was being held
and rescue him.

230
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:42,583
So, we contacted
your ship up in orbit.

231
00:11:42,666 --> 00:11:45,041
They scanned the surface of the
planet and thought they had

232
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:47,500
managed to locate him for us.

233
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,875
[LAFIEL]
No one told me.

234
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:52,708
[TOMASOF] However, it was
only his Excellency's Clyuno

235
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:56,916
that they had traced, not the
Deputy Ambassador himself.

236
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,083
So, do you know what
happened to him?

237
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:01,375
[TOMASOF]
No, I'm afraid not.

238
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:04,000
That personal communicator
was all we found.

239
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:07,500
Ma'am, I'm sorry, but we've been
unable to trace his position.

240
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:10,500
We had no more time
to try and find him.

241
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,583
I see...

242
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:19,166
You did all you could.
You have my sincere thanks.

243
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,708
[KUFADIS] 
It's time.

244
00:12:22,791 --> 00:12:24,833
The enemy fleet has
started to advance!

245
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:28,083
I love it when people make
their entrance right on cue!

246
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:30,833
Tell all ships under our
command to prepare for battle!

247
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:33,083
All ships fire
challenge signals!

248
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:34,583
You mean we're going to fight?

249
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:37,375
But of course. There are
still some Imperial ships

250
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:39,583
that haven't left the
Lobnas System yet.

251
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:41,583
We managed to buy them
quite a bit of time

252
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:43,083
with our negotiations.

253
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:44,666
Don't you think we've
done more than enough

254
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,666
to help them with
their mission already?

255
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:49,041
That's one way of
looking at it, I suppose.

256
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:51,416
But we can do more.

257
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,791
Very well, then.

258
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:56,333
[COMM. OFFICER] The enemy's
frontline squadrons will be

259
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:59,125
in range of our mobile
space-time mines in ten seconds!

260
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:01,375
[KUFADIS] The enemy squadrons
have split into two groups:

261
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:02,833
front and rear!

262
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:04,208
[SPOOR] It makes me wonder
if the squadrons at the rear

263
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:05,708
are made up of supply ships.

264
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:08,208
[KUFADIS] If so, it's a very
obvious formation to use.

265
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:09,916
[SPOOR]
That's what's worrying me.

266
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:13,333
COMM. OFFICER]
The enemy's frontline squadrons

267
00:13:13,416 --> 00:13:14,750
are now within range.

268
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:21,291
[SPOOR]
Hm... They're not firing.

269
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:24,166
Well, I guess the enemy doesn't
want to waste their mines

270
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:26,000
if they can help it.

271
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:27,000
I've got it.

272
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:28,500
What?

273
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:29,791
[SPOOR] I want the Fourth and
Fifth squadrons to remain

274
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:31,375
in their current positions
ready to shoot down

275
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:33,625
any enemies trying to
sneak through the gate.

276
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:35,875
Don't let a single ship escape!

277
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:38,041
The rest of us will attempt to
break our way through the

278
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:41,458
enemy's front line. Then we
will attack the rear.

279
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:43,041
Now wait a minute!

280
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:45,750
Our squadrons are weak enough as
it is without splitting them up!

281
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:48,750
It'll be like suicide!
What if we can't break through?

282
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:50,916
We'll be surrounded
and they'll wipe us out!

283
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,958
You listen to me,
Chief of Staff.

284
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:55,416
Back at home we're gathering
together the artists from all

285
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,958
28 provinces.

286
00:13:57,041 --> 00:14:00,416
Their task is to construct
the Letopanyu family tomb.

287
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,125
Once it is finished, we intend
to hold a great banquet

288
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:04,916
to celebrate its completion.

289
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,208
It's kind of a
tradition in our family.

290
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:09,583
[KUFADIS] I can think of
more pleasant traditions.

291
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:13,291
Okay, but what has your family
tomb got to do with any of this?

292
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:15,625
The celebration banquet
is planned to take place

293
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:19,291
in 12 years' time. I'd like
you to be on the guest list.

294
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:21,708
Uh, thank you,
that'll be a great honor.

295
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:24,916
But frankly, I can't
think that far ahead.

296
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,333
There's some important
things to sort out here first.

297
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:30,458
[SPOOR] These Kau class patrol
ships of ours are good ships.

298
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:33,333
However, they are
mass-produced and functional.

299
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:35,791
They're certainly not good
enough or beautiful enough

300
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:40,208
for me to die in. Don't worry.
We're not going to be wiped out.

301
00:14:40,291 --> 00:14:43,500
I won't let that happen.
I've got a plan.

302
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:45,583
[SPOOR grunts]
All ships, take up the eighth

303
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:49,083
dense pack formation in
individual space-time bubbles!

304
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:50,625
Can't the bubbles
at least be arranged

305

[softly grunts]

458
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:03,125
Huh?

459
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:07,375
[JINTO gasps]

460
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:09,375
Dokufu!

461
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:10,541
[gasps]

462
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:19,375
[JINTO]
Emergency take-off position?

463
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:22,208
It's the last ship... Oh, no!

464
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:29,833
[JINTO] I can't afford to die,
not in a place like this.

465
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:33,250
[DARKSES OFFICER C]
Commence countdown to take-off.

466
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:35,250
T-minus 20 seconds!

467
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:41,625
[ANGUS yells]

468
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:42,708
[ANGUS]
Damn the Abh!

469
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:44,916
I won't let you take my women!

470
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,708
Angus...

471
00:21:46,791 --> 00:21:50,458
[ <i>DARKSES</i> OFFICER C] Five...
Four... Three... Two... One...

472
00:21:50,541 --> 00:21:51,625
Lift off!

473
00:21:58,291 --> 00:22:01,916
No! What about my children?!

474
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,250
My children!

475
00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:10,208
No...! No...!

476
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:13,291
[grunts]

477
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:16,458
[LAFIEL]
If you'd died back there,

478
00:22:16,541 --> 00:22:18,625
I would have been
sorry that you'd gone.

479
00:22:18,708 --> 00:22:22,000
[JINTO]
Lafiel... I will see you again.

480
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:24,583
[GABORT]
What's the situation?

481
00:22:24,666 --> 00:22:26,208
[ <i>DARKSES</i> OFFICER D]
Checking now.

482
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:27,750
We have a response!

483
00:22:27,833 --> 00:22:28,458
[ <i>DARKSES</i> OFFICER C]
The enemy fleet's passing

484
00:22:28,541 --> 00:22:31,000
through the Lobnas Gate!

485
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:34,291
It looks like we didn't make it.
What should we do now?

486
00:22:34,375 --> 00:22:36,708
[LAFIEL] We have no other
choice but to go through.

487
00:22:36,791 --> 00:22:40,083
All ships activate their
space-time bubble generators!

488
00:22:40,166 --> 00:22:44,125
All ships prepare space-time
bubble generators... Activate!

489
00:22:44,208 --> 00:22:46,458
[ <i>DARKSES</i> OFFICER D]
Space-time bubble activated!

490
00:22:46,541 --> 00:22:47,916
[ <i>DARKSES</i> OFFICER C]
The enemy's right behind us!

491
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,291
Okay, here they come!

492
00:22:49,375 --> 00:22:50,500
Prepare for battle.

493
00:22:50,583 --> 00:22:52,625
The laser cannon is ready.

494
00:22:52,708 --> 00:22:54,333
Let's catch up with
the transport ships

495
00:22:54,416 --> 00:22:55,916
and get out of here!

496
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,458
[ <i>DARKSES</i> OFFICER C]
Enemy ships confirmed ahead!

497
00:22:57,541 --> 00:22:59,541
[LAFIEL]
Ignore them and keep moving!

498
00:24:51,375 --> 00:24:54,333
[SAMSON] Is this really all
that's left of the First Fleet?

499
00:24:54,416 --> 00:24:56,958
[LAFIEL] Perhaps I'm not fit
to be a military officer.

500
00:24:57,041 --> 00:24:58,958
I mean... I know it
was my decision

501
00:24:59,041 --> 00:25:02,125
that we got involved in this
mess in the first place.

502
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:03,250
The Vascotton Gate?

503
00:25:03,333 --> 00:25:05,541
So, now we've come full circle.

504
00:25:05,625 --> 00:25:06,916
[DUBUS] There are some
people who enjoy it.

505
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,791
And I wish you all
the best, Admiral.

506
00:25:08,875 --> 00:25:10,250
[EKURYUA]
He was the first human I met

507
00:25:10,333 --> 00:25:12,125
who was about my age.
