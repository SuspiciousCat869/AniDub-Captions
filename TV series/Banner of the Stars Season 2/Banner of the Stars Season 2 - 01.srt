[SUKAKAU CREW 2] The enemy's
front-line ships have launched

00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:58,833
a large number of smaller
space-time bubbles.

[NEREIS]
Month of Roswik, Day Seven.

21
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:11,291
The other day, we added
another star system

22
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:13,250
to the territories
of the Empire.

23
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:15,875
Our fleet has been sweeping away
anything in its path,

24
00:04:15,958 --> 00:04:20,416
and now we have apprehended yet
another retreating enemy fleet.

25
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,500
But this is hardly a battle.

26
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:24,291
It's more like a game.

27
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:28,666
Very appropriate to the
name of the Operation.

28
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,500
From the perspective
of military action,

29
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:33,375
one could say that we were on
the verge of a great success.

30
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:35,916
However, we had internal
problems to deal with.

31
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,166
Problems with the
management of the fleet.

32
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,166
Although we don't
like to admit it,

33
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:44,916
our family has a reputation
for "Spectacular Insanity."

34
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,250
My brother, the Chief of Staff,
appears to be living up to

35
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:50,916
that reputation by
continually influencing

36
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,125
and infecting the minds
of the other Chiefs--

37
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:56,500
who should be supporting
their supreme commander.

[NEREIS]
Or maybe it's just I,

40
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:08,291
who doesn't fit into
the family mold.

41
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:14,250
[NEREIS] Hmm... that's
too easy an explanation.

42
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:19,125
So, did you enjoy your bath?

43
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:21,333
Now I don't really care
whether or not you decide

44
00:05:21,416 --> 00:05:23,125
to have a bath in
the middle of a battle,

45
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:25,708
but if you do decide to do that,

46
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:27,500
at least you could
dry your hair properly

47
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:29,625
before you come up
to the bridge.

48
00:05:29,708 --> 00:05:32,083
All right. I'll be more careful.

49
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:34,083
So, what's the situation?

50
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:37,750
Foregone conclusion.
Our forces were victorious.

51
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:40,375
We've still got to confirm
how many ships we lost,

52
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:43,000
but the numbers are minimal.

53
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:45,416
[sighs] Which of course
is the result of having

54
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,541
such a good commander in charge.

55
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:50,000
[NEFEE] If you want to think
that, I'm not going to stop you.

56
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:52,500
Nor will I make any cheap
jibes about you having

57
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:54,708
a relaxing bath in the
middle of a battle.

58
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:56,541
Nor indeed about
you sitting there,

59
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:58,750
feeling smug for no reason.

60
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:01,083
But what I would like
you to tell me, Nereis,

61
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:03,291
is just how much
longer you intend

62
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:05,833
to advance aggressively
like this?

63
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,708
[NEREIS]
What's wrong with it?

64
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:11,375
Surely contributing to
the territorial expansion

65
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:14,625
of the Empire should be
seen as a great honor.

66
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:17,583
I suppose the expansion
has exceeded expectations.

67
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:19,916
However, it has its
pros and cons.

68
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,458
That's very true.

69
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:23,583
With so many territories to
govern we're starting to run out

70
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:26,083
of people to act as
administrators and ambassadors.

71
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:28,583
Hm... Oh, the
Supreme Commander

72
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:31,000
has to worry his little
head over such matters--

73
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:32,625
it's enough to make you cry!

74
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:34,708
You do realize that there
are more important things

75
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:36,166
that need to be taken care of.

76
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:38,541
Nefee, I take the responsibility

77
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:41,000
of being Commander
in Chief very seriously.

78
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:43,458
In making my decisions,
I always make a point

79
00:06:43,541 --> 00:06:45,166
of taking both the
future of the fleet

80
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:48,000
and the honor of our family
into serious consideration.

81
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:50,083
Believe it or not,
it's the honor of the family

82
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:52,208
that worries me most
about you right now.

83

A certain Admiral Bebaus?

87
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,041
Not really. The Admiral Bebaus
that I knew and loved

88
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:06,458
back then was a different
man altogether.

89
00:07:06,541 --> 00:07:08,250
Besides, he hadn't even made it

90

to the position of Admiral
at the time. [gasps]

[KENESH grunts]

would be so kind

as to let me know
exactly what he gains

97

by delving into my
past like this.

98
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:27,541
[DUSANYU] Are you sure you
know what you're saying,

99
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:30,166
Chief of Staff? If I wanted
to delve into your past,

100
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:33,583
I have plenty of more reliable
methods at my disposal.

101
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:35,208
[KENESH
I should have guessed.

102
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:37,833
Am I right in assuming that your
interest in my private life is

103
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:41,416
simply a way for you to relieve
your boredom, your Highness?

104
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:44,250
[DUSANYU] Well, that's quite
brutal of you to say that.

105
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:45,958
By the way, don't you
think that his fleet

106
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:49,000
is advancing too far,
too quickly?

107
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:50,833
[KENESH]
Whose fleet? Admiral Bebaus?

108
00:07:50,916 --> 00:07:53,958
The man I don't love?

109
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:56,500
[DUSANYU]
Yes, his fleet.

110
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:59,625
[KENESH They do seem to be
moving quite far ahead.

111
00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:02,958
But I don't think we
need to worry too much.

112
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:04,375
Even if they get into trouble

113
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:06,375
and the enemy manages
to surround them,

114
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:09,500
we have enough extra resources
to go and rescue them.

115
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:12,458
And thinking about it, if
the enemy were to do that,

116
00:08:12,541 --> 00:08:14,291
it would create an
opportunity for us

117
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:18,250
to destroy them, one that we
simply cannot afford to miss.

118
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:20,250
There's a scary side to you.

119
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:25,083
You're willing to use the
Admiral you once loved as bait?

120
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:26,750
Please don't put it like that.

121
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:29,125
You make it sound like I'm the
sort of person to think up a

122
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:32,250
whole battle plan solely to get
revenge for a personal grudge!

123
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:34,208
[DUSANYU] Of course the
advances now being made

124
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:37,125
by Nereis' fleet weren't
in your plans, either.

125
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:39,916
There are no strategically
important planetary systems

126
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,625
in the direction
they are heading.

127
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:44,041
But then surely we should
have the same concerns

128
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:46,541
for the Eighth Fleet.

129
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:48,208
I have a theory why
we should treat

130
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:50,916
the Eighth Fleet differently.

131
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,333
Their Commander in Chief
is an upstanding member

132
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:55,708
of the Star Forces who is
able to make decisions

133
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:57,833
quickly depending
on the situation.

134
00:08:57,916 --> 00:08:59,666
And I assume from
your insinuation

135
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,250
you think Nereis isn't?

136
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:03,750
Please don't forget that when
you approved of Admiral Bebaus

137
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:05,416
becoming Supreme Commander,

138
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,791
I was against the idea

139
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:09,666
and my feelings haven't
changed in the slightest.

140
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,541
[DUSANYU]
No, I haven't forgotten.

141
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:13,208
But don't you think it
would be better for us

142
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:16,166
to simply stop his advances?

143
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,208
If you're really asking
for my opinion,

144
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:20,708
then I'm afraid I'd
advise against it.

145
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:23,375
The situation isn't
serious enough yet.

146
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:24,958
[DUSANYU]
Not serious enough?

147
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:26,791
But I got the impression
you thought the Admiral

148
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:28,750
wasn't upstanding
enough for you.

149
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:30,250
I don't understand.

150
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:31,958
[KENESH] It depends on
your point of view.

151
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:33,916
After all, I am
the Chief of Staff

152
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,208
for the entire fleet
of Operation Hunter.

153
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:38,458
[DUSANYU]
I see.

154
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:41,750
So you've already
looked at the possibility.

155
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:42,958
Yes.

156
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:45,000
If the forces belonging
to his Fourth Fleet

157
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:47,916
are attacked by say, the
remnants of an enemy fleet,

158
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,750
there is an 89% chance

159
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:52,958
that the losses to Operation
Hunter overall will be minimal.

160
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:54,625
That's the prediction.

161
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:56,625
[DUSANYU] So if I
understand you correctly,

162
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:58,708
your suggestion is
that the advances

163
00:09:58,791 --> 00:10:01,000
of the Fourth Fleet
should be encouraged.

164
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:03,250
In that case, I won't
order them to stop.

165
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:06,125
However, we should be prepared
to rescue them if necessary.

166
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:08,750
I want you to organize as many
spare ships as you can

167
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:10,666
into squadrons immediately.

168
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:14,625
We want any rescue operation
to run as smoothly as possible.

169
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:15,625
[KENESH]
Understood.

170
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:17,875
Who do you want to take command?

171
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:19,250
[DUSANYU]
If there's going to be a battle

172
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:20,916
over these advancing forces,

173
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,791
then the region will
obviously become

174
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:25,750
the most strategic point
of Operation Hunter.

175
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:28,875
In which case, I...

176
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:31,583
I think we should let Admiral
Trife take command.

177
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:33,208
Daisiele!

178
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:36,541
[KENESH] But he'll rush into
things headfirst if we use him!

179
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:38,708
[DUSANYU]
Immediately assign Admiral Trife

180
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:41,125
to the appropriate star
system so that he can start

181
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:44,333
amassing his forces to
undertake this task.

182
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:46,833
I also want you to
issue orders to Beneej,

183
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:49,291
requesting that her fleet
provide a defense backup

184
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:52,083
to the ships advancing
with the Fourth Fleet.

185
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,416
I am so bored.

186
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,041
[KENESH]
Roger.

187
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,791
[DUHIEL]
Your name's Diaho, isn't it?

188
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:11,583
[DIAHO meows]

189
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:12,916
[DUHIEL]
You don't look like you miss

190
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,416
Count Hyde at all, little kitty!

191
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:21,958
[DUBUS] Saying your goodbyes
to the cats, Duhiel?

192
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:23,583
How'd you manage to find me?

193
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:25,791
How'd you know I was
out here in the garden?

194
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:27,208
[DUBUS]
Does it matter how I know?

195
00:11:27,291 --> 00:11:28,708
You were here, weren't you, Son?

196
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:31,291
Don't be so contemptuous
of your father.

197
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:33,583
[DUHIEL]
I'd never do such a thing!

198
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:35,833
[DUBUS]
That's okay then. Hm...

199
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:41,333
Isn't that cat... Isn't that the
one Lafiel gave to Count Hyde?

200
00:11:41,416 --> 00:11:43,458
His name's Diaho.

201
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:46,208
Don't think you can
impress me like that.

202
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:47,875
Even though it was
born in our house,

203
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:50,291
we're only taking care
of Diaho for Count Hyde.

204
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:52,625
I don't want you getting
too attached to the cat.

205
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:54,333
It wouldn't be nice
to be accused of stealing

206
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:55,541
someone else's pet, would it?

207
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:57,583
There's no way that
I'd want to steal him!

208
00:11:57,666 --> 00:12:01,750
It's just... It's just he's been
with Lafiel, my older sister...

209
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:04,250
He was with her? And
what does that mean?

210
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:07,000
Well, I... You see...

211
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:08,333
[DUBUS]
You might be clever,

212
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:11,541
but you still can't think
of the words to say.

213
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:15,708
From what I can see, I'd say you
were worrying about something.

214
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:17,625
You didn't want to talk
about it with anyone else,

215
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:19,375
so you ended up
trying to get advice

216
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:21,291
from cats who can't talk back!

217
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:24,750
And more interestingly, from
a cat who was near Lafiel.

218
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:28,708
No! That's not why
I'm here at all!

219
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:31,416
You know, you and Lafiel,
you always react

220
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,666
the same way when I hit
the nail on the head.

221
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,458
My hard-hearted one!

222
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:37,833
[DUHIEL]
No! It's just that I...

223
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:40,625
I wondered what Lafiel
was doing, and I thought

224
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:42,166
that if I spoke to Diaho,

225
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:45,416
it might bring back some
happy memories.

226
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,666
[DUBUS] Heh. You're
just like your sister.

227
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:50,208
You're both terrible liars!

228
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:52,666
[DUHIEL]
I'm not lying!

229
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:56,166
Come on, why don't
you admit it?

230
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,458
Huh? I'm not...

231
00:12:58,541 --> 00:13:01,250
I'm not as good as my sister...

232
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:03,958
So that's what you're
worried about, my boy.

233
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:05,333
Why didn't you just tell me?

234
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:08,791
Why are you so worried about
being compared to her?

235
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:10,500
But, Father!

236
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:16,041
[DUHIEL]
When she was my age,

237
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:19,958
Lafiel was already
training to be a pilot!

238
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:24,291
But I'm nowhere near that--I've
only just joined the Academy!

239
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:27,958
[DUBUS] So, you're worried that
you might be falling behind...?

240
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:31,416
[DUHIEL] Yes. I know I was born
a couple of years after her,

241
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,375
but she even started at the
Academy earlier than me!

242
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:36,125
[DUBUS]
You shouldn't worry about it.

243
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:38,041
That child was a special case.

244
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:41,625
I was your age when I
started at the Academy.

245
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:44,041
[DUHIEL]
But...

246
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:45,375
[DUBUS]
What's that?

247
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:47,166
I suppose you think being
the same as your father

248
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:48,625
isn't good enough for you?

249
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:50,291
You know, you're
extremely charming

250
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:52,916
as a member of
the regular royalty!

251
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,500
Listen. You and Lafiel
are different people.

252
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,916
And that's good.

253
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,208
It'd be no fun for me as a
parent if both my children

254
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:01,375
grew up to be exactly
the same kind of person.

255
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:02,833
I love you for who you are.

256
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:04,041
Understand?

257
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:06,541
But there's no way I can
compete against her.

258
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:08,500
It's not just that
we're different.

259
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:11,333
I'm no good compared
to Lafiel, Father!

260
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:15,333
You know that's isn't true,
my Hope of Abriel.

261
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:18,583
Maybe I did spend more time
playing with her than with you.

262
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:20,791
Much as I enjoyed watching
your sister grow up,

263
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:23,375
our little princess didn't
really enjoy life as a child

264
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:25,791
as much as she should have.

265
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:27,625
She wanted to grow up
far too quickly

266
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:29,625
and become an adult
as soon as possible.

267
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:32,041
Sometimes, I regret
allowing her to do that.

268
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:33,791
So when the time came
for me to raise you,

269
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:35,750
I wasn't going to make
the same mistake.

270
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,125
But that's what I want to do!

271
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:39,875
I want to become
an adult as well!

272
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:42,208
[grumbles]

273
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:44,916
So at least you admit
you're not all grown up yet,

274
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,916
my little child!
That's a good thing.

275
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,166
You don't want to have to
worry about that just yet.

276
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:52,166
There'll be plenty of time
for you to do that later!

277
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:54,291
Whether or not your family
will be proud of you

278
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:57,166
depends on what you do now.

279
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:58,041
Yes, but...

280
00:14:58,125 --> 00:14:59,041
[DUBUS]
But what?

281
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:01,375
Nothing. It was
nothing important.

282
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:03,666
I'll do my best to work
hard for you, Father.

283
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:06,333
I want to make you proud of me.

284
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:07,708
[DUBUS]
Good for you.

285
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:09,875
I'm glad we had this chance
to talk to each other.

286
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:11,791
I don't think there'll
be much opportunity

287
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:13,916
for chats from now on.

288
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,250
That's not true!

289
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:16,791
Even if I'm at the Academy,

290
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:18,625
we'll both be living
in Lakfakalle,

291
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:20,291
so we can still see each other!

292
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:22,166
You seem to have forgotten
that your father

293
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:25,250
has resumed active duty.
And it looks like my services

294
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:27,500
will be required in
the war very soon.

295
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:30,833
Are you going to the
battlefront, Father?

296
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:33,666
I don't know why you're
looking so surprised by that.

297
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,125
Did you really think your father

298
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:36,750
would stay sitting at
home doing nothing

299
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:39,708
while his two children head out
to risk their lives in battle?

300
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:41,583
No, I didn't. It's just...

301
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:43,083
Well, that's the situation.

302
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:44,958
Make the most of the
chance to say goodbye

303
00:15:45,041 --> 00:15:46,583
to the cats here tonight.

304
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:48,791
You'll be far too busy
to do it tomorrow,

305
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:51,875
what with the banquet and
packing and everything.

306
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:10,875
I wish, Father...

307
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:13,625
I wish I could believe
I'm not just a pale shadow

308
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:16,041
of my older sister, Lafiel...

309
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:19,375
[SOBAASH] Ten seconds until we
pass through the Lobnas Gate...

310
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:20,375

Roger.

342
00:17:24,416 --> 00:17:27,666
[LAFIEL] I'm the Territorial
Ambassador again?!

343
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:30,125
[JINTO]
That's better than me.

344
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:33,166
They've made me Territorial
Deputy Ambassador.

345
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:35,458
As the Aptic Empire's
Deputy Representative,

346
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:37,958
I'm always assigned the
really awkward titles.

347
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:39,875
If you really wanted me to,

348
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:41,750
maybe I could swap
positions with you.

349
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:43,916
Thank you! But you
should know by now

350
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,500
they'd never let us do
that in a million years!

351
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:48,541
When we're out here fighting
with the Star Forces,

352
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:50,250
it's obvious to see
and understand

353
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:53,500
how we're fulfilling
our duty to the Empire.

354
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:55,416
But when we keep
getting assigned

355
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,625
to these temporary
bureaucratic positions

356
00:17:57,708 --> 00:17:59,416
every time we capture
a new system,

357
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,875
it doesn't seem
to me like we're

358
00:18:00,958 --> 00:18:03,458
being much use to
the Empire at all.

359
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:05,208
[JINTO] It's a safe bet
there aren't too many

360
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:07,708
assault vessels to spare
in the Star Forces.

361
00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:10,166
You wouldn't think they'd waste
time using people like us

362
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:13,041
as Ambassadors when we
could be out there fighting!

363
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:15,250
And, I'd like to know
when it was decided

364
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:16,625
that Territorial Ambassadors

365
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:19,500
have to come from a
royal family or nobility!

366
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:21,333
Admiral Bebaus seems
to have some

367
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:24,583
pretty strange ideas
affecting his decisions.

368
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:26,041
We can't help but win.

369
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:28,250
Annexed this system
without even trying!

370
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:31,750
It would almost be fair to say
it's impossible for us to lose!

371
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:34,791
If we defeat a planetary system
and put it under our authority,

372
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:36,916
then we also have to
be able to manage it.

373
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,500
Isn't that what you told me?

374
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:41,625
We're running out of ambassadors
and administrators.

375
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:43,041
All right, all right!

376
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:46,541
I've got the perfect person
in mind for the job.

377
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:50,416
[NEREIS] Supplement to the
Memoirs, Month of Roswik,

Day 7, in the Lobnas System...

379
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:56,250
So she's going to be the
Territorial Ambassador again.

380
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:58,041
And she didn't even complain?

381
00:18:58,125 --> 00:19:01,333
Ha, ha, ha! Our captain's
growing up at last!

382
00:19:01,416 --> 00:19:03,583
Would you believe it?!

383
00:19:03,666 --> 00:19:06,208
She's not happy at all...

384
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:07,708
[JINTO]
Do you not like the appointment,

385
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:10,500
your Territorial Ambassador
Highness, Ma'am?

386
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:12,500
Whatever gives you that idea?

387
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:14,375
Just... sensed it.

388
00:19:14,458 --> 00:19:18,666
Well, it's not that I don't
like the appointment. But I...

389
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,625
I don't feel like doing it.

390
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:21,875
Oh, I see...

391
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:23,500
For the life of me
I don't understand

392
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:25,875
what the difference is between,
"I don't like the appointment"

393
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:28,208
and, "I don't feel
like doing it." Do you?

394
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:29,958
No. I have no idea,

395
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:31,708
but I don't think I really
want to get involved

396
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:35,208
in this discussion.
I value my life too much!

397
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:36,583
Okay, you two!

398
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:38,416
If you're going to have
little secret conversations,

399
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,250
kindly go elsewhere to do it.

400
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:43,625
Sorry Captain,
it won't happen again.

401
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:46,750
Does this whole situation
feel a little odd to you?

402
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:49,125
You mean about
the transport ships?

403
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:51,166
[SAMSON] Yeah. I mean, it's
normal for assault vessels

404
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:53,916
to guard transport ships in
battle, but what's all this?

405
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Accompanying them on
a routine delivery?!

406
00:19:57,083 --> 00:19:59,125
That's not a healthy attitude.

407
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:01,166
I didn't say I didn't
like doing it!

408
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:03,291
This is a mission, after all.

409
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:05,375
And how do you feel about it?

410
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:06,625
Me?

411
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:08,708
Heh. Put it this way--
it's far more enjoyable

412
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:10,833
than being in the
middle of a battlefield!

413
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:12,958
You're probably right...

414
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:19,041

Your face will
always be with me.

My heart will
always be with you.

When my earthly body has gone
and only my soul remains--

430
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:06,041
it will reach for you
in the stars.

00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:11,250
It will always, always
reach for the stars.
