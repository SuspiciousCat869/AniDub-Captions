[JINTO coughs]

3
00:00:35,958 --> 00:00:39,791
[JINTO] I've lost track of how
many days I've been down here...

4
00:00:39,875 --> 00:00:42,416
I don't know how much longer
I can remain in hiding

5
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:48,125
from the prisoners. Or even how
much longer I can stay alive.

6
00:00:48,208 --> 00:00:51,458
I ran out of things
to eat some time ago.

7
00:00:51,541 --> 00:00:55,000
I think the last time I
ate I had some Alileem.

8
00:00:55,083 --> 00:00:58,125
But it was so long ago,
I can't be sure.

9
00:00:58,208 --> 00:01:01,833
So I decided I had to
conserve my strength.

10
00:01:01,916 --> 00:01:06,041
I had to make sure I gave
my body complete rest.

11
00:01:06,125 --> 00:01:07,208
Although, to be honest,

12
00:01:07,291 --> 00:01:10,416
I didn't really have
anything else to do.

13
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,583
Unless I could gather enough
strength to steal something

14
00:01:13,666 --> 00:01:15,416
from one of the prisoners.

15
00:01:16,958 --> 00:01:20,750
This is fun! I never realized
robbery could be so exciting!

16
00:01:20,833 --> 00:01:23,458
Neither did I!
Listen up you guys!

17
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:26,833
We need you to give us all of
your money, or else I'll shoot!

18
00:01:26,916 --> 00:01:27,916
You little punk!

19
00:01:31,333 --> 00:01:33,750
That was fun! I guess you've
actually got to steal

20
00:01:33,833 --> 00:01:35,708
something to be a
successful robber.

21
00:01:35,791 --> 00:01:37,875
Who'd have thought I'd be
doing something like this?

22
00:01:37,958 --> 00:01:40,833
Have you ever stolen anything
from anyone before?!

23
00:01:40,916 --> 00:01:43,083
Oh, you've got to be kidding...

24
00:01:43,166 --> 00:01:45,291
I'm a complete amateur.

25
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:51,166
[JINTO] When I wasn't sleeping,
I tried to write poetry.

26
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:55,208
I wanted to leave behind some
evidence of my existence.

27
00:01:56,625 --> 00:02:01,291
[JINTO] Born in darkness,
Died in darkness.

28
00:02:01,375 --> 00:02:04,916
What a cliché!
Not very good, I know.

29
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,875
I don't think I'm ever
going to be remembered

30
00:02:06,958 --> 00:02:09,083
for my literary prowess.

31
00:02:15,916 --> 00:02:18,333
[JINTO gasps]
Wait a second.

32
00:02:18,416 --> 00:02:21,083
Why am I writing in
the Abh language?

33
00:02:21,166 --> 00:02:23,583
Maybe if I wrote my
poetry in Martinese,

34
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:25,583
it would sound
reasonably good.

35
00:02:27,208 --> 00:02:30,833
Hold on. There's only really one
person I'm writing this for.

36
00:02:30,916 --> 00:02:33,625
And she's not from Martine.

37
00:02:33,708 --> 00:02:35,541
What would she'd say
if my last words were

38
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:38,125
written in a language
she couldn't understand?

39
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:42,708
Would she ever know my
true feelings for her?

40
00:02:42,791 --> 00:02:46,500
What if I write some poetry in
Martinese and then translate

41
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:52,166
it into the Abh language?
No, that wouldn't work.

42
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:58,375
Besides, the only Martine
poetry I remember is a lullaby.

43
00:02:58,458 --> 00:03:03,625
A lullaby... Maybe that
isn't such a stupid idea.

44
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:08,666
[JINTO hums]

45
00:03:15,291 --> 00:03:24,583
[JINTO] I'm sorry, Lafiel.
Goodbye, Lafiel...

46
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:51,750
Captain, are you all right?

47
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:55,166
[LAFIEL] To be perfectly honest,
not really.

48
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:57,833
Is this what your world
is like all the time?

49
00:03:57,916 --> 00:04:00,333
I know Lobnas doesn't have a lot
going for it, but I've always

50
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:03,000
thought the ocean was one of
the best features on Lobnas.

51
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:05,666
Yes, the sea air is
very refreshing.

52
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:08,750
Nice weather too!

53
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:11,708
Unfortunately the Abh are more
used to traveling in space,

54
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:12,958
than on water.

55
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:14,000
[TOMASOF chuckles]

56
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:15,500
[SAMSON]
It's worse than I expected.

57
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:17,958
We've only been gone three
weeks and there's nothing left.

58
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:20,083
[TOMASOF] Yes. I expect
the rival factions of

59
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:23,125
Dokufu and Angus are
still fighting each other.

60
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:25,166
[SAMSON]
Pretty chaotic, huh?

61
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:27,166
[TOMASOF]
That's a good word to use.

62
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:30,541
[TOMASOF] I wonder what's
going to happen to Lobnas II

63
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:32,916
when all this is over?

64
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,708
[CREW A] 1st squad!
Commence the operation!

65
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:36,208
[LAFIEL grunts]

66
00:04:36,291 --> 00:04:37,666
[SAMSON]
Where are you going?!

67
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:40,125
I advise you to stay here,
Captain. It's too dangerous.

68
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:41,458
I'm here on a personal matter,

69
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:43,875
which has nothing to do
with you, so let me go!

70
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:46,125
[SAMSON] Actually it has a lot
to do with me since I took

71
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:48,166
a leave of absence to
come back here with you.

72
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:50,500
However, if you do go,
you can't go dressed like that.

73
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:51,791
You'll stand out too much.

74
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:54,041
[TOMASOF] I agree.
You'll be to easy a target.

75
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:56,166
Besides, you helped us
get back on our feet.

76
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,750
And quite frankly,

77
00:04:57,833 --> 00:05:00,125
we can't run the risk of your
Highness getting hurt out there.

78
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:02,291
If word gets out that we
allowed you to head off

79
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:03,666
without any protection,

80
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:06,125
then we'll lose any
credibility we've gained!

81
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:08,916
Don't worry about me.
I can look after myself.

82
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,791
Your job isn't to protect me.

83
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:13,166
But even so,
your Highness...

84
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,583
[SAMSON] Captain. If you think
that putting yourself in danger

85
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:17,958
like this is going to make up
for the decision you made,

86
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:19,166
you're wrong.

87
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:24,083
What do you mean by that?
I made the right decision.

88
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:26,208
I don't have to make
up for anything.

89
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:29,208
Then there's no reason for you
to risk your life unnecessarily,

90
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:30,083
is there?

91
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:33,125
[LAFIEL sighs]
Very well...

92
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:35,083
[TOMASOF sighs]
In that case,

93
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:37,791
we would like to continue with
the operation, your Highness.

94
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:39,083
Yes, go ahead.

95
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,875
It can't be easy
for them, either.

96
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:44,416
What can't be?

97
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,333
For one thing, the fact that
this used to be their home.

98
00:05:47,416 --> 00:05:49,916
All of those precious
memories destroyed.

99
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,833
I know they chose to evacuate,
but it's still probably a shock

100
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:55,916
to see devastation
on this scale.

101
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,458
I guess so.

102
00:05:57,541 --> 00:05:59,958
[SAMSON]
Well, time for me to head out.

103
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:01,458
Where are you going?

104
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:03,750
I hope you didn't stop me from
looking for him simply so

105
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:06,833
that you could give yourself
the opportunity to be forgiven.

106
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:09,541
No, we believe there
are many different ways

107
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:11,916
for you to repent of your sins.

108
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,916
[LAFIEL]
What do you mean 'we'?

109
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,708
[SAMSON] Well, our traditions
back at home, of course!

110
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:18,083
[LAFIEL]
What are you going to do?

111
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:20,750
[SAMSON] Cook! When a friend
returns after being away

112
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:23,791
for a long time, it's customary
for us to welcome them home

113
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:25,208
with a delicious meal.

114
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:27,791
And we go all out to
make it a real feast!

115
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:30,333
[LAFIEL] You actually brought
your cooking stuff with you?!

116
00:06:30,416 --> 00:06:33,125
[SAMSON] Of course! Why do you
think I wanted to come here

117
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:35,166
with you in the first place?

118
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:37,958
After what he's been through,
he deserves a meal equivalent

119
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:40,958
to someone being
away for ten years!

120
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:43,625
I just hope we find him
before it all goes cold.

121
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:45,958
I'd hate to see it go to waste.

122
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:51,208
Do you know what is one
of the worst faux pas

123
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:54,291
that you could ever make
on Midgrat? Have a guess!

124
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:56,458
Uh... Letting food
go to waste?

125
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,083
Close.

126
00:06:58,166 --> 00:07:00,625
Actually, it's to let someone
prepare a meal in your honor

127
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:02,333
and then forget to go.

128
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:05,250
Heh. I don't think the
boy would do that to me!

129
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:12,500
Do you want me to help you?
With cooking the meal, I mean.

130
00:07:12,583 --> 00:07:15,416
You, Captain?!
I... Thanks for the offer,

131
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,541
but Midgrat's style of cooking
is quite unique and requires

132
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:20,625
knowledge of
traditional methods.

133
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:22,916
Anyway, I only brought
enough stuff for me to use.

134
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I'll be fine by myself.

135
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:26,250
I wasn't forcing you.

136
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:28,583
[SAMSON] I suggest you
leave everything to me.

137
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:31,458
Besides, if I recall correctly,
you've never cooked before,

138
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:32,583
have you?

139
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:34,333
Well no, I haven't
ever cooked before!

140
00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:35,833
But I thought there
might've been something

141
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:38,833
simple I could do to
help you. Never mind.

142
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,083
I'd better get going.

143
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:41,541
--[LAFIEL] Wait a minute!
--Huh?

144
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:43,041
What is it?

145
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:45,750
Well... I was wondering if you
could tell me what sort of

146
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:48,458
reaction I should have
when I see him again?

147
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:50,041
[SAMSON]
Hm?

148
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:52,875
Of course, that all depends on
exactly who the Captain is going

149
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:54,250
to be seeing again.

150
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:55,708
What do you mean?!

151
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:58,458
I think you know precisely
who I'm talking about here.

152
00:07:58,541 --> 00:08:01,000
Well, you see,
that's a tough one.

153
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:03,958
If you're welcoming him back as
an officer who was left behind

154
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:06,875
in the line of duty, and you
still believe you made the right

155
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:09,458
decision by doing that,
then all you have to do

156
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:13,166
is give him a quick pat on
the back and say "well done".

157
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,541
What if... he wasn't
just an officer?

158
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:18,083
All I know is that I'm
cooking a meal to celebrate

159
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:20,250
the safe return
of a good friend.

160
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:21,791
As for what you should do,

161
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:25,375
I'm afraid that's a question you
need to answer for yourself.

162
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:29,666
[SAMSON] The way we do things on
Midgrat must be very different

163
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,250
from the things you're
used to as a member

164
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:32,791
of the royal family.

165
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:35,375
Royalty must have their own
traditions for you to draw on.

166
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:38,416
Please forgive me. I shouldn't
have asked the question.

167
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,041
[SAMSON]
I don't mind at all!

168
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:43,125
I'll treasure this conversation
for the rest of my life!

169
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:45,333
Not everyone has the
chance to offer an Abh

170
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:47,375
princess some advice.

171
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:49,916
Just wait till I tell the
guys back home about this.

172
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,041
They'll never believe me!

173
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:53,208
Well...!

174
00:08:57,666 --> 00:08:59,125
Jinto...

175
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:05,916
[MAD WOMAN grunts] What do
you think you're doing?!

176
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,291
It wasn't me! I didn't kill him!

177
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:12,083
What are you talking about?
Tell me who's been killed!

178
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:13,541
Ah, your Highness...

179
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:16,708
I was just about to report
this incident to you.

180
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:18,958
Y'see... she had this.

181
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:20,166
[LAFIEL gasps]

182
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:23,791
Jinto...

183
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:25,375
How did you get hold of this?

184
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:27,458
What happened to the
person you got it from?

185
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:30,000
I already told you I wasn't
the one that killed him!

186
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:31,166
You mean Jinto...

187
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:33,291
You mean Count Hyde
has been murdered?!

188
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:34,875
Look, by the time I got there,

189
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:36,375
the guy was already
dead, understand?!

190
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:38,916
What use was he gonna have
for something like that now?

191
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,208
So I took it! Yes, that's right,
I went and took it!

192
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:44,083
It might not be the
prettiest thing in the world,

193
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:45,916
but it was a shame to
let it go to waste!

194
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,125
[LAFIEL gasps]

195
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:48,541
I've ordered my men
to go to the location

196
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:50,708
where this woman says
she found the body.

197
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:52,708
If there is a body,
then we can confirm

198
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:54,291
whether or not
it's the Count.

199
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:55,708
I'm going with you.

200
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:03,708
[TOMASOF]
Is this the body?

201
00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:06,958
[MAD WOMAN] Yup. See how he's
lying all twisted on the floor?

202
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:08,708
He wasn't like that before,

203
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:11,583
he just ended up like that
when I took the headband!

204
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:15,458
Can you confirm his DNA?

205
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:17,041
[CREW C]
Checking it now.

206
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:20,541
It'll take a couple of minutes
for the results to come through.

207
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:21,958
[LAFIEL sighs]

208
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:24,375
Well, I presume that means
this isn't His Excellency?

209
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:27,541
His name's not Excellency.
I could have told you that!

210
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:31,291
I know his name's
not Excellency. His name's Jan.

211
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:33,583
[TOMASOF] You what?!
Why didn't you tell us?!

212
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:36,416
Oh dear... I must've forgotten!

213
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:40,791
[laughs]
Oh... my poor Jan!

214
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:44,250
Who'd have thought
you'd end up like this.

215
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:46,000
You were a good man at heart,

216
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:48,875
even if you were
stingy at times.

217
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:50,166
Please let me keep
the headband.

218
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,958
I want something to
remember him by.

219
00:10:52,041 --> 00:10:55,416
Some sort of little memento!
Please give me Jan's headband!

220
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,333
Please give it
back to me! Please!

221
00:10:57,416 --> 00:10:58,583
[LAFIEL grunts]

222
00:10:58,666 --> 00:11:01,833
Oh... There's no need
to be like that with me.

223
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:03,208
All right, keep it.

224
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:05,833
How did this man get ahold
of the Count's headband?

225
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:08,708
Well, what will you
give me if I tell you?

226
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:10,083
We could offer
you some food.

227
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:12,250
Or clothing, jewelry, whatever.

228
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:14,833
Gimme food! I need
some food so bad.

229
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:16,583
You see, they keep all
of it for themselves

230
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:19,291
and we hardly get anything
to eat round here!

231
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:21,875
Okay. Food. Now tell us!

232
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:24,583
[gasps]
He was singing a song...

233
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:25,708
A song?

234
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:27,875
[MAD WOMAN]
Yeah, it was kinda weird.

235
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:29,875
We heard this singing and
went to where the sound

236
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:31,208
was coming from.

237
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:34,500
That's when we saw him.
The man with the headband.

238
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:37,500
And you stole it?

239
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:39,375
[MAD WOMAN] No! But we
could have if we wanted to.

240
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:41,000
He was so weak.

241
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:44,000
The singing man wanted to trade
the headband for some food.

242
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:46,666
Jan still had a bit of food left
and because we were feeling

243
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,875
kinda mellow and
fluffy from the Alkaik

244
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,583
we'd been smoking,
he agreed to the trade.

245
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:54,000
[TOMASOF] Where was this?
Where did you find him?

246
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:55,166
You've got to tell us!

247
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,166
That information'll cost ya!

248
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,750
Very well then. As long
as you take us there.

249
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:02,875
One more question,
and this is most important.

250
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:05,708
We need to know how long ago
it was that you saw this man

251
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:07,041
and took his headband.

252
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:09,791
Well... Maybe it was yesterday,

253
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:13,583
or maybe it was even a
month ago, or even a year ago.

254
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:15,291
How am I s'posed to
remember the details?

255
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:17,208
When?! It can't have
been yesterday!

256
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:19,083
And it certainly
wasn't a year ago!

257
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:22,000
So why are you asking me?
You seem to know more than I do!

258
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:24,875
[laughs]

259
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:26,833
She's impossible!

260
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:28,541
Take us there now!

261
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:30,666
That is if you still
remember where it was...

262
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,791
[MAD WOMAN]
Of course I remember.

263
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:36,875
It's in the most important
territory here on the island.

264
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:39,708
It's near my house.
It's such a beautiful house.

265
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:41,916
Would you like to
come and see it?

266
00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:47,625
I have a request.

267
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:49,458
Why, yes of course,
your Highness.

268
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:51,250
I'd appreciate it if
you could make sure

269
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:53,250
that Jan gets a proper burial.

270
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:56,541
I'd arrange it myself, but I
don't know the local customs.

271
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:59,125
Certainly, your Highness.
But why get involved?

272
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:02,458
Is it only because he provided
the Count with some food to eat?

273
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:05,791
No. In the Abh Empire, it's
imperative that we show respect

274
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:07,625
to those with whom
we do business.

275
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:11,291
That man engaged in a business
transaction with Count Hyde.

276
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:13,791
Therefore, I would like to show
my respect by providing

277
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:15,041
a grave and some flowers.

278
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:16,500
[TOMASOF]
That's very commendable,

279
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:19,416
but are you sure you can trust
what that woman told us?

280
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,625
They might have stolen
the headband by force.

281
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:24,416
However, if she's right,
then at least we have some

282
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,583
hope that the Count
might still be alive.

283
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:29,791
I don't think it's too late to
check out that woman's story.

284
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:32,250
[sighs]
I agree...

that might be best.

--[CREW A] He's still alive!
--[TOMASOF] That's him!

309
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,375
It's the Count!

310
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:16,458
[LAFIEL]
Jinto!

311
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:19,625
Jinto... Jinto... Jinto!

312
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,458
[LAFIEL]
Jinto...! Jinto!

313
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:44,041
[JINTO grunts]
Too bright...

314
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:46,125
Turn down the lights a bit.

315
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:57,541
Hey... Lafiel...
Long time no see.

316
00:15:57,625 --> 00:15:59,750
Yes. I'm sorry...

317
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:03,916
You know what? I think
you've lost some weight.

318
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,291
[JINTO chuckles]
It's always been hard...

319
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:09,375
For you to say what
you feel inside.

320
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:11,833
[JINTO coughs]

321
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:17,333
[JINTO]
Oh...

322
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,000
[LAFIEL]
Let's go home.

323
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:26,041
Samson has been busy
preparing a meal for you.

324
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:29,250
I expect the doctor would at
least let you eat some soup.

325
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:36,166
Ah... That sounds good.
I'll look forward to it.

326
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:38,375
You know, I was dreaming again.

327
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:40,125
What were you dreaming about?

328
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:43,166
It's hard. There were
so many of them.

329
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:48,958
But I'll try to... In all
of the dreams there was...

330
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:50,375
Huh?

331
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,458
[grunts]

332
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:04,791
[LAFIEL]
What did you want to say?

333
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:11,250
I thought that Abriels...
didn't let themselves cry...

334
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:13,333
...my precious little Princess.

335
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:14,916
[LAFIEL gasps]

336
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:19,333
[LAFIEL]
Idiot...

337
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:16,458
[SAMSON] Ah! All engines
fully operational.

338
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:17,875
There we are!

339
00:20:17,958 --> 00:20:21,250
All laser cannons fully
repaired and ready for action.

340
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:23,125
Looks like we're going
to hand this ship over

341
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:26,041
in perfect condition to
whoever's taking over from us.

342
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:28,083
But of course! We've always
made a point of

343
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:31,625
taking care of this ship,
through thick and thin!

344
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:34,208
I have to admit I find
it extremely unusual

345
00:20:34,291 --> 00:20:37,250
that not a single officer
is staying on board.

346
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:39,333
Ekuryua here has
thankfully signed up

347
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:41,166
to be my navigator
on my next ship.

348
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:44,041
I don't suppose there's any way
I can persuade you to join us,

349
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:45,625
Line Wing Aviator?

350
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:48,791
I'm afraid not.
I've already fulfilled my duty.

351
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:52,250
I think the time has come for me
to retire and enjoy my pension.

352
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:53,791
[SOBAASH]
That's a shame.

353
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:55,750
[SAMSON] I was pretty surprised
to learn that the other two

354
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:57,750
decided to leave the
Star Forces, though.

355
00:20:57,833 --> 00:20:59,083
You know what, though?

356
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:01,166
I think they'll change their
minds and come back.

357
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:02,500
You could be right!

358
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,375
Well, <i>Basroil</i> , a fond farewell.

359
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:15,041
[JINTO]
Hey! Diaho!

360
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:20,958
[JINTO] I guess it must be
true that cats have no heart.

361
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:24,333
He doesn't seem to
remember me at all!

362
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:26,375
It might have something to
do with the fact that you're

363
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:28,416
handling him too roughly, Jinto.

364
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,375
You might have a point there!

365
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:32,916
[LAFIEL] You're not going to
bring him with you, are you?

366
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,125
[JINTO] Why not?
He's my cat, after all.

367
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:37,541
But don't you think he seems to
have settled down pretty well?

368
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:39,958
I mean, he might be
happier staying here.

369
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:42,625
I guess he is more of a
softie than he used to be!

370
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:46,333
I'm sure his eyes used to have
more of a wild glint about them.

371
00:21:46,416 --> 00:21:48,666
Don't be stupid. They've never
had a wild glint!

372
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:51,125
Diaho's never been anywhere
close to being wild,

373
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:52,916
even when he was a kitten!

374
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,041
Even when he was
a kitten? Really?

375
00:21:55,125 --> 00:21:59,291
And who was the one who
raised him, huh? Whoa!

376
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:03,250
Well, okay. I mean it's not like
we're leaving straight away.

377
00:22:05,333 --> 00:22:07,708
You see, doesn't he
look happy here?

378
00:22:07,791 --> 00:22:10,166
He'll forget all about it
in a couple of days.

379
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:11,666
Do you think that
white cat's become

380
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:14,916
his girlfriend or something?
It is a female...

381
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,125
Oh yes, she's quite the lady!
Selkurka, come over here!

382
00:22:22,166 --> 00:22:23,833
If Diaho's coming with us,

383
00:22:23,916 --> 00:22:26,083
then maybe I should
bring her along too.

384
00:22:26,166 --> 00:22:27,333
They seem to like each other.

385
00:22:27,416 --> 00:22:29,500
It's great how they come
when you call them!

386
00:22:29,583 --> 00:22:32,416
Hey Diaho! Come over here!
Come here, kitty!

387
00:22:34,041 --> 00:22:36,250
See? There's still
some wild cat in him!

388
00:22:36,333 --> 00:22:38,333
Maybe he just doesn't
like you very much.

389
00:22:38,416 --> 00:22:39,500
Hey, thanks a lot!

390
00:22:39,583 --> 00:22:41,541
[LAFIEL] So Selkurka,
what do you think?

391
00:22:41,625 --> 00:22:44,166
Do you want to come with me?
We're going to a place called

392
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:47,041
Martine which is far
away in the Hyde System.

393
00:22:47,125 --> 00:22:49,083
Apparently there's lots
of interesting creatures

394
00:22:49,166 --> 00:22:50,458
living on that planet.

395
00:22:50,541 --> 00:22:52,625
I'm sure there'll be
some that you can chase.

396
00:22:52,708 --> 00:22:56,125
Well, what do you say, Selkurka,
are you coming with us or not?

397
00:22:56,208 --> 00:23:00,000
Listen Lafiel... are you sure
you're doing the right thing?

398
00:23:00,083 --> 00:23:01,250
What do you mean?

399
00:23:01,333 --> 00:23:03,833
I mean leaving
the Star Forces...

400
00:23:03,916 --> 00:23:06,125
...and coming back to
my home with me.

401
00:23:06,208 --> 00:23:07,958
But I thought we'd already
been through all this.

402
00:23:08,041 --> 00:23:10,625
It's going to be fine. If you
count the time I spent training

403
00:23:10,708 --> 00:23:12,750
in the Academy, I've been
in the Star Forces

404
00:23:12,833 --> 00:23:14,541
for about ten years now.

405
00:23:14,625 --> 00:23:17,833
Taking a long vacation's
not going to affect my career.

406
00:23:17,916 --> 00:23:21,083
A vacation? Okay, so a
vacation won't affect

407
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:22,708
your career in the Star Forces,

408
00:23:22,791 --> 00:23:25,166
but what about you
becoming the next Empress?

409
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:28,000
[LAFIEL] The current Empress
is from the Cluve Royal Family.

410
00:23:28,083 --> 00:23:30,125
It could still be a couple
of generations before

411
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:33,583
a member of our family sits on
the throne. It's no big deal.

412
00:23:33,666 --> 00:23:35,291
[JINTO]
But even so...

413
00:23:35,375 --> 00:23:37,750
[LAFIEL] I'm more worried about
what's going to happen to you.

414
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:42,375
I hated not knowing whether you
were dead or alive. I really...

415
00:23:42,458 --> 00:23:44,791
I really don't want to
go through that again.

416
00:23:44,875 --> 00:23:46,375
Well, thank you
for saying that,

417
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:49,375
but I'm only going back home.
I'm sure I'm going to be fine.

418
00:23:49,458 --> 00:23:51,875
At least I'm fairly
sure I'll be fine.

419
00:23:51,958 --> 00:23:54,083
Really? I seem to
remember you telling me

420
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:56,375
you were scared of returning
to the place you were born.

421
00:23:56,458 --> 00:24:00,041
Ha. To tell you the truth,
it is a bit scary.

422
00:24:00,125 --> 00:24:02,916
Look, I know that it's something
I'm going to have to face up to

423
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,541
sooner or later, but it's
got nothing to do with you.

424
00:24:06,625 --> 00:24:08,583
I don't want to get you
involved in something

425
00:24:08,666 --> 00:24:10,416
that's my problem, Lafiel.

426
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:13,625
[LAFIEL]
Hm. Be honest with me.

427
00:24:13,708 --> 00:24:16,083
Do you want me to go back home
with you or not? Be honest!

428
00:24:16,166 --> 00:24:17,833
Give me a straight answer,

429
00:24:17,916 --> 00:24:21,000
Come on, Count Lin
Syune Locke Hyde!

430
00:24:21,083 --> 00:24:23,000
I... want you...

431
00:24:23,083 --> 00:24:24,416
I can't hear you.

432
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,208
If you agree to be by my side,
I'll be very happy, Lafiel.

433
00:24:30,291 --> 00:24:31,250
[LAFIEL sighs]

434
00:24:33,583 --> 00:24:35,291
Then it's decided!

435
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:42,708
[JINTO speaking Baronh]

436
00:25:13,208 --> 00:25:14,583
[LAFIEL speaking Baronh]
