Firstly, we can cut them off

Secondly, we can let them
through and trap them

00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:43,041
But we've got to deal with
the situation as best we can.

155
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:44,750
What about trying to
persuade the enemy

156
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:47,416
to withdraw their
offer of surrender?

157
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,458
[TRIFE] That sounds too
complicated to me.

158
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:52,625
How about I simply
refuse to accept?

159
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:54,541
Is that really what
you want to do?

160
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:59,250
[TRIFE grunts] This is
so frustrating! I can't do that!

161
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:01,250
I wish I understood what
these guys were up to.

162
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:03,291
Do you think they honestly
believed they could

163
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:05,125
escape from us?

164
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:07,875
Well, they did manage to keep
a few of our frontline forces

165
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:11,208
busy by making us tail them,
albeit temporarily.

166
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:12,708
If I were their
supreme commander,

167
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:14,666
I'd commend them
for their actions.

168
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:17,583
If they fight, their forces
will be virtually wiped out

169
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:20,500
and they'll hardly make
a dent in our firepower.

170
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:23,750
Surrender seems like the
only rational response.

171
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:27,666
Tell the enemy commander
he'll be pleased to know

172
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,208
he made the right decision.

173
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:30,833
Of course, sir.

174
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:32,916
Just say they did succeed
in taking out a few

175
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,333
of our frontline ships.

176
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:36,250
If their main fleet isn't around
to take advantage of our

177
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:38,458
weakened position, then what
would be the point?

178
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:40,041
That's not really the
responsibility of the

179
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:41,375
enemy ships we're dealing with.

180
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:42,916
All right.

181
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,750
But if that's true, then what's
the point of us being here?

182
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:46,666
They're gonna make us look
like a bunch of idiots!

183
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:49,333
Argh. We've spent all this
time and energy following them

184
00:09:49,416 --> 00:09:50,958
and they don't even
want to fight with us!

185
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:53,208
You don't have to be
so hard on yourself.

186
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:55,250
I'm not being hard on myself,
it's the truth!

187
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:57,708
You know, we were only
following orders.

188
00:09:57,791 --> 00:10:00,208
If you want to blame anyone,
you should blame those back

189
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:02,125
at Operation
Hunter Headquarters.

190
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:04,708
They're the ones who made us
come out here on this mission.

191
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:06,541
I already know that, okay?!

192
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:09,041
Just for once, I'd appreciate
it if you'd stop telling me

193
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:11,208
what I already know.
It's very annoying!

194
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:12,833
[KAHYUL]
I'm sorry.

195
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:15,916
Tell all squadrons to stop
preparations for battle.

196
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,416
Put all the mines
back into storage

197
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,625
and turn off power
to the laser cannons.

198
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:22,000
We might as well cancel
the victory celebrations,

199
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:23,541
while we're at it!

200
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:25,458
[TRIFE] Step down from battle
stations and get some rest!

201
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:26,875
I'm going to lie down.

202
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:30,125
I'll leave all the other
details for you to deal with.

203
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:32,041
By the way, don't forget
to congratulate

204
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:33,666
the enemy commander
on his decision.

205
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,666
Yes, Sir. I'll get right on it.

206
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:38,166
But if you don't mind, I think
it might be a good idea if we

207
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:40,333
kept the victory
celebrations as planned.

208
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:41,833
I mean, we did still win,

209
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:44,000
even though we didn't
actually fight a battle.

210
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:46,916
Do you mean you'd actually
planned to celebrate in advance?

211
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,916
No, but if your Highness had
wanted to celebrate victory

212
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,041
with a banquet,
we needed to be prepared.

213
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:54,458
The enemy would not
appreciate your presumption!

214
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:56,458
In that case what do you want
us to do with everything

215
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:58,333
we've planned for
the celebration?

216
00:10:58,416 --> 00:11:00,000
[TRIFE]
Well then, prepare the banquet.

217
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:02,958
But I will not authorize
anything above the bare minimum.

218
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:05,000
We still have to justify
all our expenses

219
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:06,583
to the Fleet Accountant,
you know.

220
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,833
But what about if
everybody chips in?

221
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:11,083
I appreciate the loyalty
and goodwill of our men,

222
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:12,833
but we don't want
to appear stingy.

223
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:14,833
Why should they have to
dip into their own pockets

224
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:16,750
to celebrate a victory
for the Empire?

225
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:19,583
There's no way I could possibly
allow our men to do that.

226
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:20,791
[KAHYUL]
Understood.

227
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,583
[NEREIS]
Tenth day of the Month of Keefu.

228
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:28,000
Operation Hunter is
now in its final stages.

229
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:30,291
Three weeks ago, the enemy
forces who had tried

230
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:32,291
to escape through our
weakened front line,

231
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:34,166
or at least what
was left of them,

232
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:37,416
were hunted down by Admiral
Trife and the 21st Fleet.

233
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,875
Surrender was their only option.

234
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:42,333
Of the other enemy fleets
fighting on various fronts,

235
00:11:42,416 --> 00:11:44,166
many soon followed suit.

236
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:48,208
Those who foolishly tried to
resist didn't live to regret it.

237
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:57,041
And now we, the Fourth Fleet
of the Imperial Star Forces,

238
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:58,916
are about to return
to the Star System

239
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,500
where our journey started.

240
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:02,541
Commander in Chief!
We're going to arrive at the

241
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:04,208
Vascotton Gate any moment now.

242
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:07,500
The area appears to be
clear of any enemy ships.

243
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:09,000
The Vascotton Gate?

244
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:11,625
So, we've come full circle.
Back to where it all began.

245
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:14,541
Yes, this was the System
that the Allied forces used

246
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:16,625
to launch the first
attack on the Empire.

247
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:19,958
I guess you could say that this
was where the war was born.

248
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:27,166
In which case,
we've returned to its cradle.

249
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:30,541
Now... I want you to issue an
order to our front line ships

250
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:32,250
to fire their reserve mines.

251
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:34,833
Are you sure that's
going to be necessary?

252
00:12:34,916 --> 00:12:37,250
I mean, the enemy's
nowhere in sight.

253
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:39,583
A bit of scouting
should be sufficient.

254
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:42,125
[NEREIS] We can't discount the
possibility that they might have

255
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:43,875
created an orbital fortress.

256
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:45,708
[NEFEE]
But, Nereis, don't you remember?

257
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:48,916
Our reserve mines are virtually
useless on orbital fortresses.

258
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,666
[NEREIS] I just want to
be careful, that's all.

259
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,333
[NEFEE]
Why are you doing this now?

260
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:56,875
You're usually the last
one to be cautious.

261
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:58,583
[NEREIS] You've never
been very good at judging

262
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:00,416
people's character, have you?

263
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:04,541
[NEFEE] You certainly
can't judge your own.

264
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:06,166
[NEREIS]
I don't care what you think.

265
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:07,708
Fire the reserve mines!

266
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:09,958
[NEFEE] Couldn't you at least
do it on a smaller scale?

267
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:11,291
[NEREIS]
What's wrong with you?

268
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:13,208
Why are you being
such a cheapskate?

269
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:16,625
It's not like we've got to pay
for the mines ourselves!

270
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:22,541
[NEFEE] It doesn't matter
whose money it is.

271
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:25,083
I don't like to
see things wasted.

272
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:27,041
[NEREIS] This Operation's
been a long one.

273
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:30,166
Why can't we finish it off with
a bang? With a bit of color?

274
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:32,833
What I'd really love to do is
have all the ships fire their

275
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:36,291
mines into Plane Space, not just
those in the front line!

276
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:38,416
[NEFEE] But you won't even
see the explosions in there!

277
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:41,041
If you want color, why don't
you let off a few fusion bombs

278
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:43,166
in regular space?
It's also cheaper.

279
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:45,250
That may well be true.
However...

280
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:47,083
That's really not
the point here.

281
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:49,125
 I want you to fire the mines.

282
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:52,125
If you insist. Just remember
I advised you it was

283
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:54,333
a complete waste
of time and effort...

284
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:09,333
You see? We're not
getting any response.

285
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:10,791
[NEREIS]
Reconnaissance squadron!

286
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:13,000
You may enter the
Vascotton Gate.

287
00:14:24,416 --> 00:14:25,916
Transmission coming through!

288
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,916
No sign of enemy ships
in the Vascotton System!

289
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,541
[NEFEE chuckles]

290
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:34,000
As far as I remember, I don't
think I actually said we'd find

291
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:35,416
any enemies in there, did I?

292
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,166
I was simply preparing
for the worst,

293
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:39,916
taking my responsibility
as commander seriously.

294
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Oh, did you hear
me say anything?

295
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:45,416
You didn't need to with that
annoyingly smug look of triumph

296
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,583
written all over your face.

297
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:48,541
Me? Smug? I don't think so.

298
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:50,583
[ <i>SUKAKAU</i> COMM. CHIEF]
Hold on, the message continues.

299
00:14:50,666 --> 00:14:52,291
It confirms that there's
a large number

300
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:54,166
of Allied ships in the System!

301
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:57,041
Allied ships? Where the
hell did they come from?

302
00:14:57,125 --> 00:15:00,916
Isn't it obvious? They must have
come via the Iryuush Kingdom.

303
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,166
Damn it! Why didn't anybody
tell me about this earlier?

304
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:06,833
If I remember, you were
somewhat obsessed about us

305
00:15:06,916 --> 00:15:08,208
arriving here first.

306
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:09,708
[NEREIS] Yes, but only
because I wanted the moment

307
00:15:09,791 --> 00:15:12,416
we conquered the Vascotton
System to be the pinnacle,

308
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,541
the climax of the story!
Our efforts have been wasted!

309
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:17,166
The climax of what story?

310
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,458
The second installment
of my memoirs, of course.

311
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:22,458
Of course, how silly of me!
How could I possibly not have

312
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:24,166
realized that that
was what you meant?!

313
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,625
Wandering into the System after
it has already been conquered

314
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:29,625
by another squadron is hardly
blockbuster material, is it?

315
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:32,166
This fixation on your memoirs
and your quest for fame

316
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:34,500
is completely childish!
I'd be so embarrassed

317
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:37,125
if word got out that the Bebaus
family only finds honor

318
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:38,958
in being the first
to do something.

319
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:41,541
I don't want my reputation
tarred with that brush!

320
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:43,416
[NEREIS]
What's childish about it?

321
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,333
And another thing. If people
start to assume it's a family

322
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:49,208
tradition to enter into battle
for the sole purpose of making

323
00:15:49,291 --> 00:15:51,250
our memoirs more
dramatically interesting,

324
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:54,375
then I'm afraid I'll have
to disown the Bebaus name!

325
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:57,250
It's one thing for the Bebaus
family to have a reputation for

326
00:15:57,333 --> 00:16:00,208
"Spectacular Insanity",
but this isn't spectacular,

327
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:01,625
it's just insane!

328
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:04,000
You mean to say you're actually
embarrassed by all this?

329
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:06,125
That must be a novel
feeling for you!

330
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:08,333
I would prefer to go
back a few generations

331
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:11,708
and try to stop the embarrassing
behavior at its source.

332
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:13,583
But I can't, so I'm
stuck with you.

333
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:16,125
How wise of you to
realize that, brother.

334
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:19,333
Enough talk. Now you finally
know what the situation here.

335
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:21,000
Shouldn't you be giving
us some orders?

336
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:22,291
Yes, you're right.

337
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:24,625
All ships! We will now
make a formal entrance

338
00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:26,333
to the Vascotton Gate!

339
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:32,875
[NEREIS]
Transmit a message to the enemy!

340
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:35,208
Uh, sorry, I mean to
the Allied flagship.

341
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:36,416
Roger that.

342
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,750
I wonder who's in
charge of that squadron.

343
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:41,000
[BOTH gasp]

344
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,875
This is Admiral Abriel,
Commander in Chief

345
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:45,666
of the Second Fleet, known as
the Light Snow Fleet.

346
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:48,083
I am Admiral Bebaus,
Commander in Chief

347
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:49,958
of the Fourth Fleet
of Operation Hunter.

348
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:52,583
It's truly a great honor
to meet you at last,

349
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:53,833
your Royal Highness.

350
00:16:53,916 --> 00:16:56,083
However unexpected this
meeting between us is

351
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:58,541
I assure you the sentiment
is reciprocated.

352
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:00,541
I would like to ask
a question, sir.

353
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:03,416
As you've obviously already
gained control of this system,

354
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,916
why didn't you send a patrol
ship into Plane Space

355
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,875
to keep guard? We could
have saved ourselves

356
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:10,166
a lot of mines if we'd
known you were here.

357
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:13,250
[NEFEE chuckles] In other words,
firing those mines was really

358
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:14,833
a waste of time, wasn't it?

359
00:17:14,916 --> 00:17:18,291
We havee only just arrived in
the System ourselves, Admiral.

360
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:20,916
We were about to send a patrol
ship out into Plane Space

361
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,708
as you suggest, but suddenly
there was this large storm

362
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:25,291
of mine explosions.

363
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:27,291
We owe a great debt of
gratitude to the person

364
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:29,916
who invented the friend or
foe identification system.

365
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,125
Without that, there would have
been no way we could have

366
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:35,500
escaped serious casualties
from your mines.

367
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:38,416
By the way, I gather that
my daughter is currently

368
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,458
under your command,
Admiral Bebaus.

369
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:43,083
Please accept my apologies
for the mine attack.

370
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:46,625
As for your daughter, well, she
is no longer under my command.

371
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:48,958
Why? Has she done
something wrong?

372
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:50,375
[NEREIS]
Not at all.

373
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:52,791
She's the Territorial Ambassador
for the Lobnas System.

374
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:54,458
This appears to be of
more interest to her

375
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:55,666
than active military service

376
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:58,458
and I think she intends
to continue with it.

377
00:17:58,541 --> 00:18:01,041
That doesn't seem like her.
Are you sure that's right?

378
00:18:01,125 --> 00:18:04,708
Yes. About three weeks ago we
withdrew our military presence

379
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:08,083
from the area, but then she
requested a leave of absence

380
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:10,125
with the intention of
heading back there again.

381
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:13,291
A leave of absence?
Oh, nobody told me.

382
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,791
[NEREIS] We're uploading the
information to your ship now.

383
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:17,000
Once that has been completed,

384
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:19,333
you'll be able to find
out all the details.

385
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:22,166
Thank you, I will. But I think
that's enough about my daughter

386
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:25,000
for now. I'd be interested to
hear what your next movements

387
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:26,041
are going to be.

388
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:27,375
We're awaiting
further orders from

389
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:28,958
Operation Hunter Headquarters.

390
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:32,041
I see. Well, until you actually
receive those orders,

391
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:33,583
I know what you can do.

392
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:36,500
I suggest your fleet stays and
monitors this System for us.

393
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:39,291
That will enable our fleet to
head for the Voorash System

394
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:40,541
without delay.

395
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:42,041
But sir, wait a moment!

396
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:43,750
What about the
Territorial Ambassador?

397
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:45,291
Who's going to supply that?

398
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,291
[DUBUS] I'll leave that
entirely up to you.

399
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:49,916
With respect, your Highness
gained control of this system

400
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,541
first and therefore it would
make sense for you to provide

401
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:54,166
the Ambassador from your fleet!

402
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:55,750
Well, as far as I can see,

403
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:58,291
I think that you have a number
of suitable candidates, Admiral.

404
00:18:58,375 --> 00:19:01,166
In fact, why don't you take
up the position yourself

405
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:02,750
while you wait for
your next orders?

406
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:05,375
I was forced to undertake the
role myself when I was younger,

407
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:08,166
and I have to admit I found
it exceedingly boring.

408
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:10,000
I think it might be a
good experience for you

409
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:13,291
to find out for yourself exactly
how dull a job it can be.

410
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:14,791
Oh, do you really?

411
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:16,666
There are some
people who enjoy it.

412
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:19,208
I wish you all
the best, Admiral!

413
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:21,875
[NEREIS] But I won't
have anyone to fight.

414
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:24,708
Oh, you'll have a fierce
opponent waiting for you.

415
00:19:24,791 --> 00:19:27,291
Called boredom. Now if
you'll excuse me...

416
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:30,333
[NEREIS]
Take care, sir.

417
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:32,541
[DUBUS] As soon as our fleet
has finished regrouping,

418
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:35,666
we'll head back through
Keishu Gate 193.

419
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:39,000
Our next destination will
be the Voorash System.

420
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:41,666
And after Voorash,
we'll finally be in a position

421
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:44,000
to recapture the Hyde System.

422
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:48,416
[DUBUS] And at last I may
be able to repay the debt

423
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,416
I owe to that young man.

424
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:02,583
[EKURYUA]
I don't like cats. They get old.

425
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:05,083
They may not look
any different day by day,

426
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:08,166
but before you know it,
old age creeps up on them

427
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,458
and they don't want to
play with you anymore.

428
00:20:10,541 --> 00:20:13,500
They just want to lay
around sleeping all day.

429
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:22,291
[EKURYUA]
Yuluvia! Yuluvia!

430
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:23,791
[EKURYUA]
Then one day,

431
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:26,833
you discover they've
gone to sleep forever.

432
00:20:31,916 --> 00:20:33,625
[whimpers]

433
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:38,333
[EKURYUA] We had many
cats at our home,

434
00:20:38,416 --> 00:20:41,250
but he was the only one
who belonged to me.

435
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:44,375
And he was the one who died.

436
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:48,250
After that, I swore I'd
never have a cat again.

437
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:02,458
So, in the end, he didn't
come back to us. did he?

438
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:07,458
[EKURYUA]
I wonder if he's still alive?

439
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:10,083
Or if he's gone
to sleep forever.

440
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:13,875
The Abh grow old in a very
different way from cats.

441
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:16,666
Our bodies don't look as
though they age at all.

442
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:21,125
But gradually, we sleep longer
and longer each night.

443
00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:24,208
Until finally we
never wake up again.

444
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:31,041
[EKURYUA] I've always wondered
how human beings grow old.

445
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:34,750
Like a cat? Or more like an Abh?

446
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:36,541
I wanted to ask him about it.

447
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:39,708
About exactly what it
felt like to grow old.

448
00:21:39,791 --> 00:21:42,541
But how could he possibly
know anything about it?

449
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:45,833
He's still too young
to give me an answer.

450
00:21:45,916 --> 00:21:49,291
He was the first human I
met who was about my age.

451
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:52,333
I've always wondered which was
the more peaceful way to go.

452
00:21:52,416 --> 00:21:56,291
Like Yuluvia, my cat,
or like an Abh...

453
00:21:56,375 --> 00:21:59,625
Like my grandfather.

454
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:03,291
Jinto... are you still alive?

455
00:22:03,375 --> 00:22:07,541
Or have we lost you already?
And if you have gone,

456
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:11,791
will I feel the same grief I
felt when my grandfather died?

457
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:17,583
[footsteps]

458
00:22:17,666 --> 00:22:20,125
[JINTO]
I must keep going...

459
00:22:20,208 --> 00:22:23,666
I must... keep going.

460
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:29,125
I have to survive. I want things
to be like they were before.

461
00:22:29,208 --> 00:22:32,458
When we were children,
able to play.

462
00:22:32,541 --> 00:22:36,166
When you didn't have to bear
the burden of responsibility.

463
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:40,500
When... I didn't even
really know who I was.

464
00:22:40,583 --> 00:22:43,708
Those were precious times.

465
00:22:43,791 --> 00:22:46,791
I know we can't turn
back the clock,

466
00:22:46,875 --> 00:22:51,666
but you and I, we can be
like that together again.

467
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:53,458
I can do it.

468
00:22:53,541 --> 00:22:57,333
So... I have to keep going...

469
00:22:57,416 --> 00:23:00,375
As long as I live,
I'll keep going.

470
00:23:00,458 --> 00:23:06,125
Somewhere out there...
You're somewhere out there.

471
00:23:06,208 --> 00:23:08,708
I must keep going...

472
00:24:41,708 --> 00:24:46,125
[JINTO]
I must keep going... Lafiel...

473
00:24:47,916 --> 00:24:52,208
[JINTO] In my sleep, I kept
having these dreams.

474
00:24:52,291 --> 00:24:56,625
I always dreamed I was on the
ground looking up at the stars.

475
00:24:56,708 --> 00:25:02,416
I saw Martine...
I saw Dirkoto... I saw Clasbul.

476
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:05,458
although some images were
familiar to me from pictures

477
00:25:05,541 --> 00:25:08,708
I'd seen, others were
completely new to me.

478
00:25:08,791 --> 00:25:10,875
And every time I
dreamed this dream,

479
00:25:10,958 --> 00:25:13,041
standing beside me was...
