00:00:18,208 --> 00:00:23,166
[NARRATOR speaking Baronh]

2
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,916
We're under attack!
We need help!

3
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,916
So you thought you were
gonna leave without us?!

4
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,375
Your leaving the
women behind for us!

5
00:01:36,958 --> 00:01:38,666
Take that, suckers!

6
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:46,791
Administrative Director,

7
00:01:46,875 --> 00:01:48,583
do you mean to say
that the leader is...

8
00:01:48,666 --> 00:01:51,583
You're right. I don't
need to tell you.

9
00:01:51,666 --> 00:01:54,250
[JINTO] The representative of
the Eastern Detention Sector:

10
00:01:54,333 --> 00:01:55,916
Mikay Angus.

11
00:01:57,333 --> 00:01:59,208
[MEIDEEN] Some of the staff
who wanted to stay behind

12
00:01:59,291 --> 00:02:02,375
have given up their weapons
to Angus and his men.

13
00:02:02,458 --> 00:02:04,583
And what's worse, is that
some of the prison guards

14
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:06,083
have joined the rebellion.

15
00:02:06,166 --> 00:02:08,208
They're actually fighting
against their former colleagues!

16
00:02:08,291 --> 00:02:09,750
[JINTO]
How many of them?

17
00:02:09,833 --> 00:02:12,166
[MEIDEEN]
I've no idea.

18
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:14,791
But there's gotta be
at least 500 of them.

19
00:02:16,375 --> 00:02:17,833
[JINTO] What do you think
made so many of them

20
00:02:17,916 --> 00:02:19,500
join in the rebellion?

21
00:02:19,583 --> 00:02:21,125
Probably...

22
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:23,583
Well probably because they've
maintained their loyalty

23
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:25,250
to the United Mankind.

24
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:27,375
Don't you think that's strange?

25
00:02:27,458 --> 00:02:29,166
But does that loyalty doesn't
mean they have to fight

26
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:32,375
alongside criminals and
against their own comrades?

27
00:02:34,291 --> 00:02:37,291
How the hell am I
supposed to know?

28
00:02:37,375 --> 00:02:38,708
Director?!

29
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:22,291
[SHANGAL] Hey! What the
hell's going on?

30
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:23,208
We don't know.

31
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:25,375
[SHANGAL]
Huh?

32
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:27,041
[MEIDEEN]
Perhaps you can explain to me

33
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:29,666
what they're doing. I just
don't understand the logic

34
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,916
that these prisoners are
using in this situation!

35
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,416
Don't treat me like
I'm one of Angus's men!

36
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,000
--[JINTO] Uh...
--[SHANGAL] Huh?

37
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:38,625
If there's anything we can do to
help you resolve this situation,

38
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:40,125
we're ready to help.

39
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:43,166
You speak like it's
nothing to do with you--

40
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,541
It doesn't, does it?

41
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:46,791
Well, no. Basically it's
an internal problem

42
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:48,833
for the territorial government.

43
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:51,416
But like I said,
if there's request for help,

44
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,041
we'll try and do what we can.

45
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:57,041
Here's a request! Put a stop to
this rebellion immediately!

46
00:04:57,125 --> 00:05:00,250
But that's impossible!
As I've told you before,

47
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:02,291
the ships we have available
to us aren't equipped

48
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:04,791
for fighting ground battles!

49
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:07,625
Some use you're gonna
be to us, anyway.

50
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:10,250
Have you managed to make contact
with the orbital station?

51
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:11,416
No, not yet.

52
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:13,041
[JINTO]
Calling the <i>Basroil</i> !

53
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:15,333
This is the Territorial
Deputy Ambassador.

54
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:16,833
[EKURYUA]
This is the <i>Basroil</i> .

55
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:19,750
[JINTO] Second Aviator Ekuryua,
where's the Captain?

56
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:21,291
[EKURYUA]
Do you want me to wake her?

57
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:23,250
[JINTO]
I'm afraid so. Sorry.

58
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:25,416
There's been a big
rebellion on the island.

59
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,708
I can upload the
situation report to you.

60
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:29,416
Can you prepare to receive it?

61
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,625
[EKURYUA]
Right away.

62
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:32,500
[JINTO]
I'll be in touch again later.

63
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:35,166
I think this is becoming
too interesting.

64
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:36,375
--[beeping]
--[JINTO, MEIDEEN] Huh?

65
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:38,416
Administrative Director,
this is Chief Kenny,

66
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,875
Head Guard at the 28th Gate.
May I speak with you please?

67
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:42,750
[MEIDEEN]
Go ahead.

68
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:44,166
Mr. Dokufu would like permission

69
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:46,166
to enter the
Administrative Sector.

70
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:47,500
He doesn't need permission.

71
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:49,291
We've agreed that he's
free to come and go from

72
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:51,458
the Administrative Sector
whenever he wants.

73
00:05:51,541 --> 00:05:54,375
I know. But it's not
just Mr. Dokufu.

74
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:57,333
All the prisoners from the
Central Detention Sector

75
00:05:57,416 --> 00:05:59,000
are asking if they can
be moved permanently

76
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:00,541
to the Administrative Sector!

77
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:03,750
You've got to be joking.
You can't allow that to happen!

78
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:05,208
There'll be nothing
to stop Angus

79
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:06,708
and his men from attacking!

80
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:09,125
They'll be able to move straight
from the East to the West!

81
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:11,833
We know that. That's why
my men are working to try

82
00:06:11,916 --> 00:06:14,208
and prevent that
situation from occurring.

83
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:16,541
However, considering the size
of the Administrative Sector,

84
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:18,125
that's virtually impossible.

85
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:20,083
Tell Dokufu he
doesn't need to worry.

86
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:22,000
We'll protect the walls.

87
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:24,375
Actually, no.
Let me talk to him.

88
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:26,166
I understand your concerns
about the size of the

89
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:28,416
Administrative Sector,
but this is an emergency!

90
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,666
We need protection
as soon as possible!

91
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,208
That's not necessary.

92
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:34,375
As the battle progresses against
the rebels from the Eastern

93
00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:38,166
Detention Sector, it's obvious
that we've got the upper hand.

94
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:39,750
[DOKUFU] But the battle
is spilling over into

95
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:41,083
the housing districts!

96
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:44,291
Stray bullets have already
caused several deaths!

97
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:45,750
Oh... by the way,

98
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:48,041
you need to make sure you
watch out for stray bullets.

99
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:50,333
[DOKUFU]
And how bad is it gonna get?

100
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:52,416
All we want is permission
to take shelter

101
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,000
in the Administrative District.

102
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:56,583
It's not like we want to
move there permanently!

103
00:06:58,333 --> 00:07:01,125
No, it's not possible.
Besides, the Central Detention

104
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:03,333
Sector covers an
extremely large area.

105
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:05,125
You should be able to find
somewhere in there

106
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:06,833
to shelter from the bullets.

107
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:09,500
Looks like we don't
have a choice.

108
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:10,541
[LAFIEL]
Commander Gabort.

109
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:12,958
This is the
Territorial Ambassador.

110
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:14,000
[GABORT]
Your Highness.

111
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:16,916
We already know
about the rebellion.

112
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,625
Good. That'll speed
things along.

113
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:20,541
I want you to take the
<i>Darkses</i> and land

114
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:23,833
at the Administrative Sector
Seaport on Lobnas II.

115
00:07:23,916 --> 00:07:26,625
Are there any other transport
ships that are able to help out?

116
00:07:26,708 --> 00:07:29,208
Yes. The <i>Trekses</i> and the
<i>Lweyses</i> are available.

117
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:31,583
Do you want the three of us to
land on the planet together?

118
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:33,833
[LAFIEL] No. I'll give
them separate instructions

119
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:35,500
about where to land.

120
00:07:35,583 --> 00:07:36,666
[GABORT]
Roger.

121
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,666
[KENNY] Now you get yourself
back to the detention sector!

122
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:41,708
[DOKUFU grunts]

123
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,166
[DOKUFU]
You know,

124
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:46,208
you might want to treat
me a little more kindly.

125
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:48,958
I intend to remember this
when I become Prime Minister

126
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:50,541
of the Lobnas System.

127
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:54,333
[KENNY] What?! Don't make
me laugh, you clown!

128
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:55,500
Huh?

129
00:07:57,708 --> 00:07:59,791
[PRISON GUARD H] What happened?
I thought I heard a shot!

130
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:01,875
[PRISON GUARD H groans]

131
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,625
[PRISON GUARDS]
Huh?

132
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:06,875
[grunts]

133
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:07,541
[JINTO]
Huh?

134
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:08,958
I don't believe it!

135
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:11,041
How did the rebels manage
to break through Gate 28?!

136
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:12,791
This administration
room is the only place

137
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:15,750
left that's still secured. But I
don't know how much longer--

138
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:17,083
Huh?

139
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,291
It's Dokufu!

140
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:22,791
He was involved in the
rebellion from the start!

141
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:25,875
Ha! All right boys! Let's give
them a little surprise!

142
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:26,958
[PRISONER B]
Yessir!

143
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,333
Tomasof! What's the situation
like down there now?

144
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:34,333
[TOMASOF grunts]
They've started an attack

145
00:08:34,416 --> 00:08:36,416
from the Central
Detention Sector!

146
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,958
So now the second wall is being
attacked from two sides:

147
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:41,041
the Eastern and
the Central Sectors!

148
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:42,458
What are we going to do?

149
00:08:42,541 --> 00:08:43,958
Okay Tomasof.

150
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:45,750
Because the Administrative
Sector has already been taken

151
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:48,500
over by the mob, it's pointless
to continue defending

152
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:51,541
the second wall. I want you
to use your men to drive

153
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:53,125
the mob out of the
Administrative Sector

154
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:56,500
and then put all your strength
into defending the third wall.

155
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:58,666
Yes sir, understood.

156
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:01,208
Excuse me, Your Excellency.
Is it possible for us to board

157
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:03,041
the ship from the
Western Detention Sector?

158
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:04,583
[gasps]

159
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:07,666
Is there a port or some
sort of ferry there?

160
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:10,041
Our transport ships should
be able to land anywhere

161
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:12,333
on the surface of the ocean.

162
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:14,125
Sure thing.
We don't have any docks,

163
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:16,166
but we can send a
marine patrol ship.

164
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,666
Tell your transport ship that
we need it to land as close

165
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:21,375
as possible to the beach
for this to succeed.

166
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:25,000
I'll let them know. But don't
we also have that seaport

167
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:26,500
in the Administrative Sector?

168
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:30,208
Can't we make use of that
as well? Send one ship there?

169
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:31,875
Good idea. Okay, go ahead.

170
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:34,125
Um... if we're
actually leaving,

171
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:35,958
are you going to let
us get on board first?

172
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:38,541
It appears the rebels' main
goal right now is to go after

173
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:40,375
the women for
breeding purposes.

174
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:42,500
I can't think of any other
reasons for them to attack

175
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:44,166
the Western Sector
at this time.

176
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,708
Therefore, we'll make
you a priority.

177
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:48,625
But what about all the
women on your staff?

178
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:50,166
They're in danger too.

179
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,916
They all still have their jobs
to do. Of course, we'll try

180
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,541
and get them out of here to
safety as soon as we can.

181
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:57,250
[SHANGAL] What about
our emigration papers?

182
00:09:57,333 --> 00:09:58,875
We don't have permission
to leave yet!

183
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:02,333
[MEIDEEN] I know. We don't have
time to do all the paperwork.

184
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:05,208
However, all the prisoners
have distribution numbers.

185
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:07,708
We could use those numbers
instead of the official

186
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:09,750
emigration documents for
the inhabitants of the

187
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:13,708
Western Detention Sector.
Do you have any objections?

188
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:15,291
[JINTO]
None at all.

189
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,125
Mr. Administrative Director?

190
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:20,916
You're a much nicer man
than I thought you were.

191
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,458
Seeing as how I live on
this side of the wall,

192
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:25,458
of course I'm a nice man.

193
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:27,083
Thank you so much.

194
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:30,458
[LAFIEL]
Territorial Deputy Ambassador?

195
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:32,791
Yes, Territorial Ambassador?

196
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:34,625
[LAFIEL] We've been assessing
the situation and

197
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:38,916
we've decided to send Line Wing
Aviator Samson to assist you.

198
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,291
Thanks, that's great.

199
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:43,208
And when will the transport
ships be ready for us?

200
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:45,583
[LAFIEL] I've already given
orders for them to leave.

201
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:48,333
The <i>Darkses</i> will land in the
original location and the other

202
00:10:48,416 --> 00:10:49,833
two ships will land
off the coast of the

203
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:52,958
Western Detention Sector.
How does that sound to you?

204
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:55,750
Just what you'd expect from
the Territorial Ambassador!

205
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:57,166
Great leadership!

206
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:59,083
[LAFIEL] Don't talk
to me like I'm a fool.

207
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:01,750
A child could make
these decisions.

208
00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:03,375
One thing you should know:

209
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:05,500
the ships can't get too close to
the shore because the water's

210
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:06,375
too shallow.

211
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:07,541
[JINTO]
Got it.

212
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,541
[SKIPPER A]
Hurry up!

213
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:11,625
We have to return to the
administrative sector soon!

214
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:12,875
[PRISON GUARD M]
One more trip!

215
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:16,750
[PRISON GUARD N]
Leave the rest behind!

216
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:19,250
[PRISON GUARDS]
Yes sir!

217
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:22,000
[PRISONER C laughs]
You think you can get off

218
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:25,625
this miserable planet so easily?
You got another thing coming!

219
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,500
Skipper! We've finished
getting everyone on board.

220
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:32,916
All right, cast off.

221
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:33,958
Yes sir!

222
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:38,958
What do you mean they've
destroyed the ship?!

223
00:11:39,041 --> 00:11:40,750
Damn!

224
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:42,166
[JINTO] How did the
rebels attack one of your

225
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:43,791
marine patrol ships?

226
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:45,625
[MEIDEEN] They must have been
waiting for them when the guards

227
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:46,875
went back to pick up
their colleagues

228
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:49,375
who were stranded
behind the second wall.

229
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:51,791
We'll have to make do
with the other two ships.

230
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:53,333
The other two?

231
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:56,416
Do you mean to say you only
ever had three patrol ships?!

232
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,291
Uh, yeah. I'm afraid so.

233
00:11:58,375 --> 00:11:59,875
[JINTO] Then we we're
not going to make it!

234
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:02,666
Remember there aren't any docks.
We need to get everyone out to

235
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:05,958
our transport ship off the coast
of the Western Detention Sector.

236
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:07,125
With only got two ships,

237
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:08,916
it'll take ten days to
move everyone out!

238
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,166
Ten whole days?!

239
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:12,125
We're going to have to
secure the harbor area

240
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:13,708
in the Administrative Sector.

241
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:16,208
If we can board most people
there, we won't have to rely

242
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:19,208
on your marine patrol ships.
If you can't do it,

243
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:21,750
we won't make it by
the evacuation date!

244
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:23,125
We'll do our best.

245
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:25,333
You have no choice!
Otherwise some of your people

246
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:27,458
are going to have
to be left behind.

247
00:12:27,541 --> 00:12:29,333
But you can't let
that happen to us!

248
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,375
Can't you use your influence
with the Star Forces

249
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:32,708
to do anything else?

250
00:12:32,791 --> 00:12:35,791
Please try to understand,
Administrative Director.

251
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:38,458
The internal affairs of this
territory are the responsibility

252
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:41,083
of you and your staff.
We can't interfere.

253
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:43,583
If you can get yourselves
to our Transport Ships,

254
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:46,416
you can claim refugee status
and then we can re-house you

255
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,458
in the prisoner
of war camps.

256
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:51,500
However, we cannot be seen
to be helping you to escape.

257
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:55,416
It would put us in a difficult
diplomatic position.

258
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,958
[MEIDEEN]
I see...

259
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:59,291
How ironic that in these days
when we can travel thousands

260
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:01,875
of light years through space,
we have difficulty making a

261
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:04,750
short journey across a
small stretch of water.

262
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:06,333
[JINTO]
Very poetic.

263
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:08,541
I suppose we should get on
with securing the harbor

264
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:11,541
in the Administrative Sector,
Your Excellency. Do you agree?

265
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:12,875
[JINTO]
Mm-hm.

266
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,375
Will you be honest with me?

267
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:17,041
Would I be correct in assuming
that you, Your Excellency,

268
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:20,208
is secretly want this
rebellion to succeed?

269
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:21,625
Why would I?

270
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:23,625
If they succeeded, there'd be
less people for you to

271
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:27,458
transport and take care of.
Much as I hate saying this,

272
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:30,041
I'm grateful to you. Even
though you're a representative

273
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:33,083
of an invading power,
I am truly grateful.

274
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:34,541
You're more than welcome.

275
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:37,000
If they do succeed,
I'll lose my position.

276
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:38,916
Either Dokufu or
Angus will become

277
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,708
the Territorial
Representative and it's

278
00:13:40,791 --> 00:13:44,208
a sure thing they'll retract
permission for us to emigrate.

279
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:46,000
And then you'll be free
to wash your hands

280
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:48,083
of this troubled situation.

281
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:50,791
[JINTO] Actually, even if the
representative changes,

282
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:53,250
the emigration papers
from the territorial government

283
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,250
are still valid for the
inhabitants of the

284
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:57,333
Western Detention Sector.

285
00:13:57,416 --> 00:14:00,291
If people wish to board,
we won't refuse them.

286
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:02,458
Even if the new
Territorial Representative

287
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:03,750
cancels permission?

288
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:05,833
If they don't know about
it in the first place,

289
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:07,500
they can't cancel
it can they?

290
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:09,541
[MEIDEEN]
Hm... You've got a point there.

291
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:12,166
I just conveniently
forget to tell them.

292
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:14,000
--[JINTO] Yes.
--[beeping]

293
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:16,458
[SAMSON] Sorry it's taken me a
while to get in touch, my boy.

294
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:18,375
[JINTO]
Samson! Where are you?

295
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:20,125
[SAMSON]
I feel embarrassed to admit it,

296
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:22,125
but I'm still at
the lodging area.

297
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:24,916
My men were under the impression
that they were here on leave,

298
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,125
so it took some time to
get them all together.

299
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:29,458
I'll be there as soon as I can.

300
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:31,583
[MEIDEEN] Excuse me,
Your Excellency, it seems

301
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:34,000
the situation is more
serious than we expected.

302
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:37,500
With Dokufu's help, the mob has
made significant progress.

303
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:40,458
It appears they've advanced
as far as Central Park.

304
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:44,583
[JINTO] But that's right outside
the Administrative Agency!

305
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:51,375
Close in on the armored car
on the east side of the park!

306
00:14:57,958 --> 00:15:00,250
Hmph! Took them long
enough to get here!

307
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,750
[MEIDEEN] We should get
out of here pretty soon.

308
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:07,416
[JINTO]
Where can we go? The harbor?

309
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,208
They're not leaving us
with many options.

310
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:11,166
It'll be hard to co-ordinate
things from there.

311
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:13,250
[JINTO] If you're going to
the harbor, I'll go with you.

312
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:16,083
There's no reason
for me to stay here.

313
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:17,625
[JINTO]
Did you hear that, Samson?

314
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:20,666
We're gonna head to the seaport.
We'll meet you there.

315
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:21,750
[SAMSON]
Got it.

316
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:26,291
[PRISON GUARD Q] All prisoners
with numbers up to 22F-147

317
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:27,875
are to board ship number 5.

318
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:29,916
Please do this as
quickly as possible.

319
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,375
Those of you with
numbers over 22F-148

320
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:35,333
will board ship number 6 which
will arrive in 30 minutes!

321
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:37,541
[OFFICIALA]
Ship number 4 has departed!

322
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:38,791
[OFFICER B]
This is Control.

323
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:41,541
Ship number 6 has
left for shore.

324
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:43,750
[MEIDEEN] Has the first ship
that left come back yet?

325
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:47,083
[JINTO] They've unloaded
all the passengers.

326
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:50,833
They plan to re-enter the
atmosphere in 30 minutes.

327
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:52,333
[MEIDEEN]
Really?

328
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:54,208
[JINTO] It's a miracle we've
been able to secure the area

329
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:55,791
for this long.

330
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:57,541
[MEIDEEN]
Yeah, I agree.

331
00:15:57,625 --> 00:15:59,333
There's still a long way to go.

332
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:01,166
Why don't you go and
rest for a while?

333
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:03,125
I know better than
anybody whether or not

334
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:04,958
I need a rest and I'm fine.

335
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:07,625
Don't waste your time
worrying about me.

336
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:10,750
Uh, excuse me, sir. There's a
call for you from Tomasof.

337
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:12,375
He's in Sector 14.

338
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:13,916
[MEIDEEN]
Put him through.

339
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:14,833
Meideen.

340
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:16,250
[TOMASOF]
It's all over!

341
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:19,000
We can't hold the 12th
Eastern Road for much longer!

342
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:21,291
[MEIDEEN]
The 12th Eastern...?

343
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:23,958
Damn it! I should've seen
it coming! Their intention

344
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:27,791
is to block off our route to
the Western Detention Sector!

345
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:30,083
[TOMASOF] Permission requested
to remove the back-up forces

346
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:31,583
from the third wall.

347
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:32,916
[MEIDEEN]
I can't do that!

348
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,708
The third wall is our
last line of defense!

349
00:16:35,791 --> 00:16:38,250
Your Excellency. Would you
be willing to allow the staff

350
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:42,083
to emigrate with only their
identification numbers?

351
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:44,041
Of course. That's not
a problem for us.

352
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:46,208
[MEIDEEN]
Thank you. Tomasof?

353
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:48,958
I'm heading to the Western
Detention Sector.

354
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:51,625
Give me one hour, although it
probably won't take me

355
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:53,083
that long to get there.

356
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:56,083
Until then, I need you to
continue defending the road.

357
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:58,125
Once I've arrived at the
Western Detention Sector,

358
00:16:58,208 --> 00:17:00,333
we can split the
squadrons in two.

359
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:02,750
The first will defend the third
wall and the Western section

360
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:05,500
of the first wall. I want
the second squadron to guard

361
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:07,916
the harbor area
with their lives.

362
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,833
Our priority is to get all
the women from the

363
00:17:09,916 --> 00:17:11,875
Western Detention
Sector on board.

364
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:14,500
Next to board will be the
squadron guarding the harbor.

365
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:16,375
It doesn't matter if they
want to emigrate or not.

366
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:18,333
we just need to get
them out of there.

367
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:20,458
I'll leave it up to you to
decide the exact size

368
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:23,583
of the squadrons and who should
command them. Understand?

369
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:25,666
[TOMASOF]
But, Administrative Director...!

370
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:26,916
[MEIDEEN]
Understand?

371
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,333
[TOMASOF]
Uh! Yes sir.

372
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:32,958
However, don't you think
it might be better for you

373
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:34,916
to escape using
regular planes?

374
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,250
We can temporarily disengage
from our missions

375
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:39,291
and protect your journey
to the airfield.

376
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:42,416
[MEIDEEN] No! If the prisoners
waiting to board see any planes

377
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:46,083
suddenly taking off,
they might start to panic.

378
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:48,958
And then who knows
what might happen.

379
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:50,333
[TOMASOF]
Very well.

380
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:52,083
We'll try and hold the front
line for another hour.

381
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:53,708
Until then...

382
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:55,125
[MEIDEEN]
That's the situation.

383
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:57,916
I'm going to travel with
Shangal to the Western Sector.

384
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,666
Your Excellency should make
your way straight to the harbor.

385
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,833
You will get on board with
the squadron defending

386
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:05,166
the Administrative Sector.
Once you're on board,

387
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,750
we can safely abandon the
port and get out of here.

388
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:09,541
I'm the Deputy Ambassador,

389
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:12,333
so you you have no right
to order me to do anything.

390
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:13,541
You're absolutely right.

391
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:16,000
I'm sorry if my comments
caused any offence.

392
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:18,291
[JINTO]
Samson, I want you and your crew

393
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:20,041
to return to the <i>Basroil</i> .

394
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:21,458
But, what are you
planning on doing?

395
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:23,791
I'm going to head over
to the Western Detention Sector

396
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:25,875
with the Territorial
Representative and try to

397
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:29,375
help and make this emigration
process work as best as I can.

398
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:33,208
Well, as I'm your guard,
I can't go back without you.

399
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:36,000
[JINTO] But the deadline for the
Basroil to evacuate the Lobnas

400
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:38,375
System is approaching fast!

401
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:39,750
You're the Line Wing Aviator!

402
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:41,541
They're going to need you
and your crew on board,

403
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:44,083
otherwise they won't be able
to enter Plane Space!

404
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:47,583
I suppose you've got a
point there, my boy.

405
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:49,500
Although, I have every
confidence that the crew

406
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:52,000
left on board are capable
of doing a good job,

407
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:54,250
there are still lots of
things that need to be done.

408
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:56,666
And I wouldn't want them to hold
any sort of grudge because

409
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,375
their boss and half the
crew have left them

410
00:18:58,458 --> 00:19:00,125
to do all the work!

411
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:03,125
But doesn't the <i>Basroil</i> need
its Supply Officer as well?!

412
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:05,041
[JINTO] I have three
officers still on board.

413
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:07,833
They know exactly what
they're doing. If I need to,

414
00:19:07,916 --> 00:19:11,000
I can retroactively approve
any decisions they've made.

415
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:14,333
But first I need to sort
this mess out down here.

416
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:17,833
But your Excellency!

417
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:19,750
Do you realize what you're
getting yourself into?

418
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:22,625
This is a serious situation!
We don't want you trying to

419
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:24,541
be the hero and
getting yourself hurt!

420
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:27,458
I'm not trying to be heroic and
I really don't want to get hurt.

421
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,541
I'm staying behind to see
the whole thing through.

422
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:31,000
What do you mean by that?

423
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:33,750
My original intention was
to return to the <i>Basroil</i>

424
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:36,666
once all those who wished to
leave were safely out of here,

425
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,125
but that looks impossible now.

426
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:40,000
We're not going to have
time to get everyone on board

427
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:41,958
the transport ships.

428
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:45,166
We'll have to make a decision
to stop at some point.

429
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,541
It's going to be easier to
determine the best moment

430
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:51,166
to stop if I'm down here
than if I'm up there in space.

431
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:52,750
You're staying to make
sure as many people

432
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:54,083
as possible can leave?

433
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:55,208
[JINTO]
Hm.

434
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:59,791
[MEIDEEN laughs]
Your Excellency,

435
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:01,875
you may still be young,
but let me tell you something

436
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:03,291
I think you should know.

437
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:06,166
That attitude of yours is
what heroism is all about.

438
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:07,333
Is it really?

439
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:08,750
Believe me, it is.

440
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:11,083
And it's refreshing to see
that you don't realize it.

441
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:12,916
Whether you're trying
to be a hero or not

442
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,375
doesn't matter right now.
You're helping us out here.

443
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:16,916
I'd be honored if
you came with us,

444
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,583
but we don't have
much time left.

445
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:20,250
Then let's get going!

446
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:21,791
[SAMSON]
I've been thinking.

447
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:24,458
If I leave you down here
and go back to the <i>Basroil</i> ,

448
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:26,541
won't the Captain be
annoyed with me?

449
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:29,125
I've heard enough rumors
about how angry Abriels get

450
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:30,208
and I'm a bit nervous.

451
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:31,583
[JINTO]
Don't worry about it.

452
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:33,291
I'll make sure I'm
the one to tell her.

453
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:35,458
If it comes from me,
you'll be fine.

454
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:38,208
Anyway, it's extremely
unlikely that her Highness

455
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:40,500
would publicly
display her anger.

456
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:42,875
[SAMSON] Hm. Judging by the
look on your face, I'd say

457
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:45,541
you probably know her Highness
better than any body else.

458
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:48,541
I honestly can't see her ever
taking out her anger on you

459
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:51,916
or crying in front of you.
It just wouldn't happen.

460
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,750
Ah, the innocence of youth.

461
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:57,333
You know, you've always seemed
like a young boy to me.

462
00:20:57,416 --> 00:20:59,666
How about once all this
is over you and I get together

463
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:02,166
for a drink? It's kind of
a tradition back home.

464
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:05,125
[JINTO]
Sure... I'll look forward to it.

465
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:06,541
[LAFIEL]
I see...

466
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:09,458
You've decided that you're
going to stay down there?

467
00:21:09,541 --> 00:21:12,416
[JINTO] Yes... I thought
I learned my lesson

468
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:16,958
in Aptic that being a hero
wasn't really my style...

469
00:21:17,041 --> 00:21:18,166
[LAFIEL]
I understand.

470
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:20,708
You must do whatever
you believe to be right.

471
00:21:20,791 --> 00:21:24,291
[JINTO] Thanks...
I appreciate your support.

472
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:28,291
[MEIDEEN] Your Excellency!
Hurry up! We've gotta leave!

473
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:29,333
I have to go now.

474
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:31,833
[LAFIEL]
All right... You take care.

475
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:35,666
[JINTO] I will.
So... I'll see you later.

476
00:21:39,958 --> 00:21:41,416
[JINTO]
Sorry about that.

477
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,958
[MEIDEEN]
Okay, let's go!

478
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:53,083
[PRISONERS cheering]

479
00:21:57,958 --> 00:21:59,958
Your route appears to be
secure right up to the

480
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:03,208
37th intersection.
After that, however...

481
00:22:03,291 --> 00:22:05,958
Please accept my thanks.
You've done a good job.

482
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:08,333
[TOMASOF] As far as we can tell,
the safest way to get to the

483
00:22:08,416 --> 00:22:10,958
Western Detention Sector
is via 14th Street.

484
00:22:11,041 --> 00:22:11,916
[MEIDEEN]
Thank you.

485
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,250
[TOMASOF]
Please be careful.

486
00:22:18,541 --> 00:22:20,875
We're driving pretty close
by the actual fighting.

487
00:22:25,291 --> 00:22:26,916
Hey guys, this isn't
the right road!

488
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,833
Did you input the wrong route?

489
00:22:28,916 --> 00:22:30,583
Hey, what's going on?

490
00:22:30,666 --> 00:22:32,208
Huh?!

491
00:22:32,291 --> 00:22:34,500
Damn! I can't seem to
over-ride the program!

492
00:22:34,583 --> 00:22:36,375
[PRISON GUARD U] It's useless.
I've secured the system.

493
00:22:36,458 --> 00:22:39,041
[grunts]
You son of a...!

494
00:22:39,125 --> 00:22:42,291
[chuckles]
Everything's been taken care of.

495
00:22:43,791 --> 00:22:48,291
So the rebellion...
It's happening at all levels.

496
00:22:48,375 --> 00:22:50,125
[PRISON GUARD T]
Hey! Don't be stupid!

497
00:22:50,208 --> 00:22:51,291
Give me the gun!

498
00:22:51,375 --> 00:22:53,833
[grunting]

499
00:22:53,916 --> 00:22:55,250
[gasps]

500
00:22:55,333 --> 00:22:56,125
Ha!

501
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:58,458
[JINTO gasps]
No, stop!

502
00:24:46,708 --> 00:24:48,333
A child needs a mother!

503
00:24:49,375 --> 00:24:50,666
Huh? Why me?!

504
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:52,041
[DOKUFU]
Don't worry.

505
00:24:52,125 --> 00:24:54,041
We're confident that one
day we're going to see lots

506
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:56,583
of little children
running around here!

507
00:24:56,666 --> 00:24:58,666
[gasps]

508
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:01,750
[DOKUFU laughs]
Make your mind up!

509
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:02,958
Time's up.

510
00:25:05,166 --> 00:25:07,666
[LAFIEL]
Kill you? Don't make me laugh!

511
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:10,416
Death would be far too
sympathetic a fate!
