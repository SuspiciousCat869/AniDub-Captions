1
00:00:19,208 --> 00:00:25,166
[NARRATOR speaking Baronh]

2
00:01:02,625 --> 00:01:04,666
Captain! An electromagnetic wave

3
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:07,166
is heading directly for us
from the planet below!

4
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:08,500
Hostile attack?

5
00:01:08,583 --> 00:01:10,250
[EKURYUA]
It's coming straight at us!

6
00:01:10,333 --> 00:01:11,500
Now there's another one!

7
00:01:11,583 --> 00:01:13,583
This one's from one of
the planet's satellites!

8
00:01:13,666 --> 00:01:15,208
[gasps] Another!

9
00:01:15,291 --> 00:01:18,333
The magnetic shield hasn't
reached its full power yet.

10
00:01:18,416 --> 00:01:20,791
[EKURYUA]
And now another!

11
00:01:20,875 --> 00:01:22,250
Hold on a minute...

12
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:24,875
Their power output is too
weak for it to be an attack.

13
00:01:24,958 --> 00:01:27,458
What is it? A transmission?

14
00:01:27,541 --> 00:01:28,666
[EKURYUA]
Could be.

15
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:30,250
I've just identified
the conversion format,

16
00:01:30,333 --> 00:01:31,833
so we can find out.

17
00:01:32,708 --> 00:01:34,125
[BOTH sigh]

18
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:36,083
You shouldn't scare
me like that.

19
00:01:36,166 --> 00:01:37,958
We now have four
different requests

20
00:01:38,041 --> 00:01:39,791
for communication coming in.

21
00:01:39,875 --> 00:01:42,125
Our priority is the
territorial government.

22
00:01:42,208 --> 00:01:45,791
This is odd. All the
transmissions are saying

23
00:01:45,875 --> 00:01:48,833
they're representatives of
the territorial government.

24
00:01:48,916 --> 00:01:51,250
[JINTO, LAFIEL]
Huh?

25
00:01:51,333 --> 00:01:52,875
Why not open all of them?

26
00:01:52,958 --> 00:01:55,708
We can't listen to four
people at the same time!

27
00:01:55,791 --> 00:01:58,875
If you'll let me, I don't
mind givin' it a try.

28
00:01:58,958 --> 00:02:00,083
Okay, then.

29
00:02:00,166 --> 00:02:01,541
Second Aviator!

30
00:02:01,625 --> 00:02:04,291
Open up all four of the
transmission circuits.

31
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:06,625
Stop being... so bossy.

32
00:02:06,708 --> 00:02:08,041
No, I'm not really...

33
00:02:08,125 --> 00:02:10,791
I'm just wearing my Territorial
Deputy Ambassador hat.

34
00:02:10,875 --> 00:02:11,708
[EKURYUA]
It's on.

35
00:02:11,791 --> 00:02:13,041
[JINTO]
Huh?

36
00:02:15,791 --> 00:02:20,416
[ALL chattering]

37
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,666
[EKURYUA]
This is the bridge.

38
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,083
Preparations to launch
the Calike are complete.

39
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:10,583
Roger. This is the Calike.
All systems okay to go.

40
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:12,125
Start propulsion.

41
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:15,541
Engines activated.

42
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:17,666
You are cleared for departure.

43
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:18,958
Departing.

44
00:04:32,958 --> 00:04:34,708
Jinto...

45
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,833
[PEOPLE chattering]

46
00:04:37,916 --> 00:04:39,166
[JINTO]
Excuse me, please!

47
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:40,625
Let me introduce myself.

48
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:43,791
I'm the Territorial
Deputy Ambassador, Count Hyde.

49
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:46,166
By my side is the
Territorial Ambassador,

50
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:48,500
her Highness the
Viscountess Paryunu.

51
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:50,791
I have to admit that we
find this a little confusing

52
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:52,375
and I hope you understand why.

53
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:54,041
We didn't expect
a single territory

54
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:55,375
to have four different
governments.

55
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:56,250
So therefore...

56
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:58,416
[ALL chattering]

57
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,458
Will you all please
be quiet for a second!

58
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:04,083
As you may have already
gathered, we have all four

59
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:07,250
of your transmission circuits
open at the same time.

60
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:09,333
[MEIDEEN] What made
you do such a thing?

61
00:05:09,416 --> 00:05:11,416
[JINTO] We assumed it would
be the simplest way for us

62
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,916
to get an accurate
overview of the situation.

63
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,791
I hope it was the
right decision.

64
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:17,333
[JINTO growls]

65
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:19,958
[JINTO] Now, we'd like
each of you to take turns

66
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:22,125
explaining to us
why you're here.

67
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:23,833
My name is Geol Meideen.

68
00:05:23,916 --> 00:05:26,500
I am the Administrative
Director of Lobnas II.

69
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:29,375
Now that our planetary system
has regrettably been brought

70
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:31,583
under the control of
the Empire, I believe

71
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:34,583
that my job requires me to
represent the interests of

72
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:37,000
our inhabitants in their
dealings with you.

73
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:39,708
[JINTO] What happened
to the Prime Minister?

74
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:42,416
[MEIDEEN]
Lobnas II has no Prime Minister.

75
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,500
Its constitution is unique in
that the Administrative Director

76
00:05:45,583 --> 00:05:47,458
may act as the
Executive Officer,

77
00:05:47,541 --> 00:05:50,083
when appointed directly by
the Central Government.

78
00:05:50,166 --> 00:05:52,666
This position is
currently held by me.

79
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,041
Oh, I see.

80
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:57,291
My name is Yuuri Dokufu
and I hold a rightful claim

81
00:05:57,375 --> 00:06:00,000
to the position of Prime
Minister of the Lobnas System.

82
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:03,500
Huh? But that appears to
contradict what Mr. Meideen

83
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:04,916
has just told me...

84
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,541
[DOKUFU] It's merely a
difference of interpretation.

85
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:09,833
I was elected as the
result of an impartial,

86
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:11,416
free and fair election.

87
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,583
As opposed to some "official"
who was assigned here

88
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:17,083
by the Central Government
only a year ago.

89
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:18,416
How can you say that?!

90
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,583
You only started claiming
to be Prime Minister

91
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:22,083
about three hours ago!

92
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:23,291
And another thing!

93
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:25,541
It was hardly a "free
and fair" election!

94
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:28,000
The only people who were able
to vote were your cronies!

95
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:29,750
[DOKUFU]
Anyone on the electoral register

96
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:31,250
was able to cast their vote.

97
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:33,208
[MEIDEEN]
Exactly! Only your cronies

98
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:34,791
qualified to get
on the register!

99
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:37,625
Uh, maybe... we should move
on to the next person?

100
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:40,166
[SHANGAL] I, too, am Prime
Minister of the Lobnas System

101
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:42,208
elected in an
impartial election.

102
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:43,958
My name is Lala Shangal.

103
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:47,291
But I would prefer it if you
called me Madam Prime Minister.

104
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:50,083
I see. Thank you. Hm...

105
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:52,500
And I suppose you're the
Prime Minister, as well?

106
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:55,000
[ANGUS] I don't hold
any great store by titles.

107
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:57,666
I don't need an election.

108
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,208
In any case, it's the
will of God that we

109
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:02,291
should be in charge of
this planetary system.

110
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:05,041
After all, we are the
strongest around here.

111
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:07,916
[JINTO] And, uh, what's
your name, please?

112
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,958
Mikay Angus.

113
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:11,666
If you didn't win an election,

114
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,791
how can you claim
to be in charge?

115
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:18,000
By strength, by popularity,
and by the true will of God.

116
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:19,333
Oh, I see...

117
00:07:19,416 --> 00:07:20,875
Well, I can see you all have

118
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:23,500
a very complex situation
to deal with here.

119
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:25,708
I think we'd prefer to wait

120
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:27,791
until you've sorted everything
out between yourselves.

121
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:30,083
We haven't got
any time for that!

122
00:07:33,708 --> 00:07:35,250
[JINTO]
Why not?

123
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:37,791
[MEIDEEN]
Isn't it obvious?

124
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:39,750
I want you to declare me as
the official representative

125
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:41,666
so that we can start
receiving support right away!

126
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,250
[JINTO]
What do you mean, support?

127
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:45,041
[MEIDEEN] Are you saying
it's not possible?

128
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:46,916
[JINTO] Not necessarily,
but we need to know

129
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,958
what kind of
support you require.

130
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:51,208
At the very least, we could
offer the basic things

131
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:52,916
your people need for survival.

132
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,583
[MEIDEEN] In that case,
it would be best if they were

133
00:07:54,666 --> 00:07:56,000
distributed under
the supervision

134
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:57,541
of the Administrative Agency.

135
00:07:57,625 --> 00:08:00,041
If we need to go through the
official process of surrender

136
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:02,041
for that to happen,
then let's get on with it.

137
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:04,583
Our people need food
and they need it quickly.

138
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:05,833
The only way it's going to be

139
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:07,791
distributed fairly
is through us.

140
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:09,458
If you hand the food
over to the others,

141
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:12,416
it'll just end up in the
mouths of their own people!

142
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,791
That's simply not true!

143
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:16,125
Everyone on this
planet is our friend.

144
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:18,500
All supplies will be
distributed equally.

145
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:20,750
Thereby using the
opportunity to extend

146
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:21,791
your base of power!

147
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:23,666
You can't trust men
to do anything!

148
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:27,000
My duty is to protect all the
women who live on this planet.

149
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:30,375
A bureaucrat, a man with
no balls, and a woman!

150
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:31,625
You should choose us.

151
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:33,375
We're the only ones who
can protect the food

152
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:34,833
and get it where it's needed!

153
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:36,833
[MEIDEEN] Listen to them.
You can guess what'll happen

154
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:38,125
if you hand anything
over to them...

155
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:40,166
Are you in the middle
of a civil war?

156
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:42,125
[MEIDEEN] You could say
we're on the verge of it...

157
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:44,708
Maybe you could explain
what's going on?

158
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:46,916
[MEIDEEN]
You mean you don't know?!

159
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,166
Well, the majority
of the inhabitants

[JINTO]
So, what you're saying

178
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:38,458
is that Lobnas II is nothing
more than a huge prison?

179
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:41,708
We prefer to use the term
"correctional institution."

180
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:43,750
Well, in that case,
the other three...

181
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:47,125
Uh, does that mean
they're prisoners?

182
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:49,666
[DOKUFU] I refuse to accept
such a description!

183
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:53,625
What is true is that as a result
of the law of the United Mankind

184
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:56,166
we were forcibly
immigrated to this planet.

185
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:59,208
But as time goes on,
Lobnas is drifting away

186
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:01,125
from the authority of
the United Mankind.

187
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:03,375
[LAFIEL]
Did he not know about this?

188
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:06,000
Or did he assign me to
this system on purpose?

189
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:07,125
[ANGUS]
That's right.

190
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:08,333
It doesn't matter
if we're designated

191
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:09,666
as prisoners and them
as prison guards!

192
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,583
[LAFIEL]
It must have slipped his mind.

193
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:14,833
I suggest we hold a
democratic general election,

194
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:18,291
thereby choosing the proper
representative of the people.

195
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:21,083
How will you organize
the electoral commission?

196
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:24,375
What exactly is an
electoral commission?

197
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:26,375
I can try and explain it to you,

198
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:29,083
but I don't think it's a job
you'd really want to do.

199
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:30,625
Are you making fun of me?

200
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:33,583
Holding an election is
absolutely out of the question!

201
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:36,291
It's a certainty that a prisoner
would end up being elected!

202
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:38,916
Because there are far more
prisoners than guards!

203
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,625
But you won't know that
for sure unless you try.

204
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:43,833
Those of us who
used to be prisoners

205
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:45,708
are divided in our opinions.

206
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:47,375
And some of the ex-prison guards

207
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:49,250
may have different
opinions, too.

208
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:51,083
They may not want to
vote for Meideen.

209
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:52,833
[MEIDEEN]
You are still prisoners!

210
00:10:52,916 --> 00:10:55,500
And my men are still on
active duty as prison guards

211
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:56,916
and don't you forget it!

212
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,916
I think maybe we should
shut down the transmission

213
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,750
for a minute. What do you say?

214
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:01,666
'Kay.

215
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:02,916
Cut them off?

216
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,875
I think so.

217
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:06,958
All right everyone, we need
to discuss this matter.

218
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,208
We will suspend transmission

219
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:10,500
but please wait for us
to contact you again.

220
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:13,500
Looks like this is going
to be a tougher assignment

221
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:14,458
than expected!

222
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:15,625
Got any ideas?

223
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:17,458
What do you think we should do?

224
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:19,583
Well, the most basic
rule in business

225
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:22,416
is to make sure you're dealing
with the right person.

226
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,666
It doesn't matter who
you arrange a deal with,

227
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:25,916
however big or small,

228
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,500
if that person is unable
to deliver the goods.

229
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:32,625
[LAFIEL] So who do you think
can deliver the goods here?

230
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:34,166
[SOBAASH] If anyone's got
the right credentials,

231
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:35,375
it would be Meideen.

232
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:37,500
As Administrative Director,
he has access

233
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:40,625
to information and analysis
about the local population,

234
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:41,750
as well as having

235
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:44,125
an administrative
structure in place.

236
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:45,458
So you mean

237
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:47,291
we gotta deal with the
guy who's favorite to win?

238
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:48,666
How boring!

239
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,666
Yeah. I'm with you.

240
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:53,166
I don't believe this!

241
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:55,833
I'm not going to make some crazy
decision simply to make life

242
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:57,625
more exciting for you!

243
00:11:57,708 --> 00:12:01,125
Let's get the Administrative
Director back up on the screen.

244
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:02,375
Are you sure?

245
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:04,291
Yes, I'm sure!

246
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:05,375
That didn't take long.

247
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:06,916
[LAFIEL]
I've decided to accept you

248
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,583
as the territorial
representative.

249
00:12:08,666 --> 00:12:11,166
You'll see that you have
made the correct decision.

250
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:13,708
[LAFIEL] If you in turn accept
me as your ambassador,

251
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:16,541
then we will have completed
all the necessary procedures.

252
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:17,750
[MEIDEEN]
I accept.

253
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:19,750
And I request supplies
and aid immediately.

254
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:21,000
[LAFIEL]
Understood.

255
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:23,666
Specify a delivery
location for the supplies.

256
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:26,208
[MEIDEEN] Your assistance
is greatly appreciated.

257
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:29,625
However, there is something else
I would like to mention...

258
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:31,000
Go ahead.

259
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,208
Until recently, we have relied
on the armed forces

260
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:35,625
of the Central Government to
help control the prisoners.

261
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:37,750
However, your arrival has
meant those forces

262
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:40,000
have been driven
out of the area.

263
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:42,625
I have to be honest with you
and say that I'm not confident

264
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:44,125
we can restrain the
prisoners using

265
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:46,583
only the police force down
here on the planet.

266
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:48,416
It's possible we might
be able to provide

267
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,833
some sort of military
assistance.

268
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:52,958
[MEIDEEN] I don't mean to
question your abilities, but

269
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:55,250
do you have enough resources
to fight a ground battle?

270
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:57,416
[JINTO]
A ground battle?

271
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,500
Surely the prisoners
aren't armed?

272
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:02,166
[MEIDEEN]
Of course, strictly speaking,

273
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:04,750
the prisoners aren't
allowed to own weapons.

274
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:06,666
[gunshot]

275
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:08,833
[MEIDEEN]
However, it appears the rules

276
00:13:08,916 --> 00:13:10,708
haven't always been
enforced with the attention

277
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:12,500
to detail that they
should have been.

278
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:14,416
To put it more bluntly, we know

279
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,291
that some of the
prisoners have weapons.

280
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:18,500
As far as we can tell,
they are fairly primitive,

281
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:21,208
probably using some sort
of homemade gunpowder.

282
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:23,458
But they can still be a threat
if used in the right way.

283
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:24,791
[LAFIEL]
But if there's an uprising,

284
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:26,625
then we can simply
halt the supply of food.

285
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:28,500
And if you want, we
could also blow away

286
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:29,958
a bit of the planet's
atmosphere.

287
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:31,541
Wouldn't that be enough
to stop the rebellion?

288
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:33,625
Huh?!

289
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:34,541
[JINTO clears throat]

290
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:36,000
When the Abh-- I mean

291
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:38,166
when we have to take
emergency measures

292
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,041
on a ground world,
there's often a tendency

293
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:42,541
to be quite excessive
in the use of force.

294
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:44,666
Please be assured
we bear no ill will

295
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:47,208
against you, and that,
personally, I think it's wrong

296
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:49,416
for us to impose such
drastic measures

297
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,500
from space on such delicate
ground worlds as yours.

298
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:55,208
Really, there's nothing
to be worried about!

299
00:13:55,291 --> 00:13:57,000
But how could a planet
possible recover

300
00:13:57,083 --> 00:13:58,458
from losing its atmosphere?

301
00:13:58,541 --> 00:14:00,958
No matter how justified
the motives are?

302
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:02,458
[JINTO]
You're right of course.

303
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:05,375
The only action we'll take
will be to stop food supplies.

304
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:07,416
We won't launch an attack
on the planet from space

305
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,625
unless specifically
requested by you.

306
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:11,041
[MEIDEEN]
Why would I do that?!

307
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:13,625
It would be like
requesting mass suicide!

308
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:15,083
[JINTO]
But if you let people know

309
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:17,708
that such action is an option,
won't it help to act

310
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:20,541
as a deterrent
against rebellion?

311
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:23,500
[MEIDEEN] I don't suppose
I have much choice.

312
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:25,291
I will say this to you.

313
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:27,416
While I appreciate
and am grateful for

314
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,083
the Territorial Ambassador's
efforts to assist,

315
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:32,500
I have now realized that
the problems of this planet

Thank you.

323
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:02,458
Thanks for the information.

324
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:06,416
Hey! Haven't we arrived yet?

325
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,416
No, but it won't be
too much longer.

326
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:11,041
Are you sure it's okay
for you to come with me?

327
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:12,166
Course it is.

328
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:14,416
These young guys
can handle anything.

329
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,916
With them in charge, the
ship'll be in safe hands.

330
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,416
It's you we've got
to worry about,

331
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,583
and that's why I'm comin'
to look after you.

The planet's one big hive
of vicious criminals, right?

333
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:27,083
Besides, it's been a while
since I've set foot on land.

334
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:30,666
Can't let an opportunity
like this slip away!

335
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,916
[JINTO] But there's probably
nothing down there.

Blue skies... blue seas...
Everything you could wish for!

361
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:58,666
This is great! The smell
of salt in the air!

362
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,250
The smell of salt?

363
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:02,541
Yup, this is the smell
of the seaside!

364
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:04,875
Every ocean is
made up of salt water.

365
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:06,708
Didn't you know that, my boy?

366
00:17:06,791 --> 00:17:09,291
This is the first time
I've ever been to an ocean.

367
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,666
[SAMSON] Really? Well,
this wonderful smell

368
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:14,250
is proof that this
is the real thing!

369
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:15,791
Even though

370
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:19,541
the rest of the planet
is a gloomy prison.

371
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:21,791
[MEIDEEN]
Welcome to Lobnas II.

372
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:24,916
[JINTO] It's nice to meet you,
Administrative Director.

373
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,375
If I may, I would like
to say what an honor it is

374
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:30,708
to meet you face to face,
your Excellency Count Hyde.

375
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:34,458
And now let me update you
on the current situation.

376
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:39,041
The only inhabited area on the
planet is here on Lajay Island.

377
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:41,250
The red area shows you
the detention sector

378
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:43,250
and the white one the
administrative sector.

379
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:45,166
Located within the
administrative sector

380
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:46,666
are various facilities,

381
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,833
accommodations for the prison
guards and their families,

382
00:17:48,916 --> 00:17:50,500
local markets and so on.

383
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:52,250
Obviously, the detention sector

384
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:54,166
is where the prisoners
are housed.

385
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:55,791
And what are these lines here?

386
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:57,666
[MEIDEEN]
They're actually walls.

387
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,750
On the east side is
the men's sector,

388
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:01,458
on the west, the women's.

389
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:03,208
The center sector is mixed.

390
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:05,541
We call them respectively
the Eastern, the Western,

391
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:07,250
and the Central
detention sectors.

392
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:10,083
It's fairly straightforward.

393
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:11,708
Surely everyone
would want to live

394
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:13,666
in the Central detention sector?

395
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:16,291
They first have to fulfill
a certain requirement.

396
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:18,000
What? Good behavior?

397
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:21,500
No, not that. They must
undergo sterilization.

398
00:18:21,583 --> 00:18:23,458
Sterilization?!

399
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:26,958
A bureaucrat, a man
with no balls, and a woman!

400
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:28,166
You should choose us.

401
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:30,250
The three who claim
to be Prime Minister--

402
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:33,166
do they represent each of
the three detention sectors?

403
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:34,250
That's right.

404
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:36,208
[JINTO]
So the Western sector must be

405
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:38,166
represented by Lala Shangal,

406
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:41,416
the Center by Dokufu,
and the East by Angus?

407
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,750
[MEIDEEN]
Very impressive, Ambassador.

408
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:44,541
Absolutely correct.

409
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:46,291
I was just guessing.

410
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:49,583
Why don't you just sterilize all
of the prisoners on the island?

411
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:51,291
Force them to be sterilized?

412
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:53,875
I couldn't possibly do
anything so inhumane!

413
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:55,291
But if the Empire thinks

414
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:57,916
that is the best way forward,
who am I to disagree?

415
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,500
We wouldn't do
something like that!

416
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:02,375
The Empire doesn't like to get
involved in the internal affairs

417
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:03,791
of the ground worlds.

418
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:06,208
[MEIDEEN] That's all very well,
but given our situation

419
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:09,083
we wish you would get involved.

420
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:10,875
[JINTO]
What do you mean?

421
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:12,541
[MEIDEEN] I tried the
warning you suggested,

422
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:14,875
but it didn't seem
to have had any effect.

423
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:17,541
The prisoners in the Eastern
sector are gathering together

424
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:19,666
and they are believed
to be armed.

425
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,375
Are you suggesting
that they're planning

426
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:23,250
some sort of attack on you here?

427
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:25,208
[MEIDEEN]
It seems increasingly likely.

428
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:27,333
It is possible that the
men are trying to invade

429
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:30,375
the Central sector, but
only as a means to an end.

430
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:33,458
It's becoming apparent that
their final objective is to get

431
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:36,041
to the women in the
Western detention sector.

432
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:37,625
[JINTO]
Well, that sounds terrible.

433
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:40,708
[MEIDEEN] You don't realize the
seriousness of the situation!

434
00:19:40,791 --> 00:19:42,875
Please forgive me,
your Excellency.

435
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:44,375
[JINTO]
That's okay...

436
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:46,916
Obviously the women are here
because they are criminals.

437
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,458
However, many of those women

438
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:51,791
were victims of crime before
they turned to crime themselves.

439
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:53,666
Being a victim
was often a trigger

440
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:55,916
that caused them
to change sides.

441
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,291
And for most of them, the
crimes that were committed

442
00:19:58,375 --> 00:20:01,125
against them
were related to sex.

443
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:02,500
They are here because
they have chosen

444
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:05,916
to live in a world without men.

445
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,833
You can't trust
men to do anything!

446
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:11,416
My duty is to protect all the
women who live on this planet!

447
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,666
[JINTO]
I see...

448
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:15,208
[MEIDEEN]
I want you to protect them.

449
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:17,208
But... you make it
sound as though

450
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:19,416
you're intending to relinquish
all responsibility

451
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,833
for what happens
in this situation!

452
00:20:21,916 --> 00:20:23,250
Yes, that's right.

453
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:26,250
Perhaps I should've been
clearer from the beginning.

454
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:27,708
All of us here,

455
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:30,666
the administrative staff,
the guards, their families,

456
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:33,291
the people who
run the markets.

457
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:35,541
We intend to seek refuge.

458
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,875
[JINTO]
But, why?!

459
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:43,916
[MEIDEEN]
I'm sure you can figure it out.

460
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
[JINTO] You think the prisoners
may be dangerous enough

461
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:47,416
to start an uprising?

462
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,875
[MEIDEEN]
Exactly.

463
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:51,500
[JINTO]
I acknowledge your request.

464
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,000
I'll have to discuss
the issue with

465
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:55,583
Her Royal Highness the
Territorial Ambassador,

466
00:20:55,666 --> 00:20:57,458
and then come back
to you with a decision.

467
00:20:57,541 --> 00:20:59,291
[MEIDEEN] How can you be
so relaxed about it?

468
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:01,416
The rebellion could
start at any moment!

469
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,541
Is that what the Empire
wants to happen here?

470
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:05,791
[JINTO]
I could be wrong,

471
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:07,750
but an uprising
could still take place

472
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:09,541
even if you'd
all left the island.

473
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:11,541
[SAMSON] In fact, if all
the guards have left,

474
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:14,625
it would mean the probability of
rebellion would likely increase.

475
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:17,041
[MEIDEEN] I suppose you could
look at it that way.

476
00:21:17,125 --> 00:21:19,250
[JINTO] I don't think you'll
have to wait too long.

477
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:22,000
We just need to get more of an
understanding of the situation

478
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:23,958
before we can make
any final decisions.

479
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:26,166
We'll help you
in any way we can.

480
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:29,833
[JINTO] What? I thought we
were the ones helping them!

481
00:21:29,916 --> 00:21:31,750
You didn't mention this before,

482
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:34,083
but do you have any idea
roughly how many people

483
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:36,708
would be seeking refuge
from the situation?

484
00:21:36,791 --> 00:21:38,916
We can get a detailed
list to you later,

485
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:44,666
but as far as I remember
it was about 20,000.

486
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:46,583
20,000...?!

487
00:21:47,041 --> 00:21:49,875
[SOBAASH]
He'll be all right.

488
00:21:49,958 --> 00:21:50,916
Who will be?

489
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,500
Well, it's probably
nothing, but...

490
00:21:53,583 --> 00:21:56,000
This was the time that Supply
Officer Lin was meant

491
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:58,541
to have started
the conference call.

492
00:21:58,625 --> 00:22:02,041
The Line Wing Aviator's with
him, so we don't need to worry.

493
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:04,291
[SOBAASH]
Very well...

494
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:05,833
[LAFIEL]
Isn't it...

495
00:22:05,916 --> 00:22:08,541
Isn't it time for you to go
down to the ground world now?

496
00:22:08,625 --> 00:22:10,666
[JINTO]
What? Already?

497
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:14,000
I'll be there in a minute.

498
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:17,416
Do you want me to bring
you back a souvenir?

499
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,000
Idiot.

500
00:22:20,458 --> 00:22:22,333
[JINTO]
I'm sorry, Lafiel...

501
00:22:29,583 --> 00:22:33,208
[SOBAASH]
He will be okay.

502
00:22:33,291 --> 00:22:35,083
Yes.

503
00:22:35,166 --> 00:22:37,166
[JINTO]
Isn't it strange?

504
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:40,500
That that was our
last conversation.

505
00:22:40,583 --> 00:22:43,041
Our very last...

506
00:22:43,125 --> 00:22:47,125
When what I really
wanted to say was...

507
00:22:47,208 --> 00:22:50,666
But I couldn't find the words.

508
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:53,375
I'm sorry, Lafiel...

509
00:22:53,458 --> 00:22:55,791
Goodbye, Lafiel...

510
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:59,083
I wanted to say it,
but I couldn't.

511
00:24:46,333 --> 00:24:47,791
Would you please
stop doing that!

512
00:24:47,875 --> 00:24:51,708
I hope you're not treating
me like a little kid.

513
00:24:51,791 --> 00:24:53,166
What was that you just said?

514
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:54,750
We're not the prisoners here!

515
00:24:54,833 --> 00:24:56,166
That was slanderous!

516
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:57,708
This is quite unforgivable.

517
00:24:57,791 --> 00:24:59,333
You say you want
to get out of here,

518
00:24:59,416 --> 00:25:02,208
but at the same time you're
busy making plans to stay.

519
00:25:02,291 --> 00:25:04,833
Not to mention our new society.

520
00:25:04,916 --> 00:25:06,916
--What?!
--[SHANGAL] With Angus?!

521
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:07,791
Miss Fazun!

522
00:25:07,875 --> 00:25:09,291
We're coming under attack!

523
00:25:09,375 --> 00:25:12,041
This place will soon
be worse than hell.
