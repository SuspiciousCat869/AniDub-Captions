Hey guys, this isn't
the right road!

00:02:10,875 --> 00:02:12,375
Did you input the wrong route?

[PRISON GUARD T]
Hey, what's going on?

5
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,083
Huh?

00:02:16,166 --> 00:02:18,291
Damn! I can't seem to
over-ride the program!

7
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:20,416
[PRISON GUARD U] It's useless.
I've secured the system.

How could you...?

00:02:22,625 --> 00:02:25,750
[chuckles]
Everything's been taken care of.

10
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,625
[JINTO grunts] I don't
understand why you guards

11
00:02:29,708 --> 00:02:32,000
want to aid the prisoners
with this rebellion.

12
00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:34,833
Ha! That's easy. It's for
the Alkaik of course.

13
00:02:34,916 --> 00:02:37,625
And what's that? The name
of some sort of god?

14
00:02:37,708 --> 00:02:39,208
I suppose for some
of the people here,

15
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:41,458
it really is like
a god to them.

16
00:02:41,541 --> 00:02:44,416
It's a narcotic only
found on Lobnas II.

17
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,875
They're doing this for drugs?!

18
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:49,416
Yes. We don't know who
started it, but the prisoners

19
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,333
have been manufacturing drugs
using a very primitive method

20
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:55,833
of extraction from
the Alkaik plant.

21
00:02:55,916 --> 00:02:58,250
And now the prison guards
have started to infiltrate

22
00:02:58,333 --> 00:02:59,666
the drug trade?

23
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:00,500
Yes, that's right.

Why do you have
to be so cruel?

33
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:20,291
I thought you two were friends?

34
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:22,541
Some things are more
important than friendship

35
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:23,375
in this life.

36
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:25,416
I hope you understand now...

37
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,500
...why I didn't want you to
withdraw even temporarily.

38
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:30,833
If we were to leave them alone
for two months, then this

39
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:33,666
planet would be quickly be
taken over by drug addicts.

40
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:36,583
And this place would
turn into a living hell.

41
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:39,166
Why didn't you tell
me all this earlier?

42
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:42,083
I didn't want to show
any weakness to an enemy!

Administrative Director.

Don't you want to know
what's going to happen next?

45
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,375
I mean aren't you curious to
know what I've planned?

46
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:50,833
About what I'm going to do with
you and your friend here?

47
00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:52,958
I know that you're a coward
and therefore I know

48
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:54,541
you're not going to do
anything with us that might

49
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:57,416
jeopardize your access
to the supply of Alkaik.

50
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,375
I also know that scum like you
don't work for themselves,

51
00:04:00,458 --> 00:04:03,041

orders to take us directly

[whistles]
Very clever, Director.

54
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:10,333
Absolutely right. You need
intelligence to become

Your Excellency, surely you've
got some sort of weapon?

62
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:32,625
I never thought
that I'd need it.

63
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:13,125
I still can't believe
they took over the

so quickly!

00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,541
[PRISON GUARD U] I've kidnapped
the Administrative Director.

66
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:20,250
Take me to the boss.
He's expecting me.

67

[JINTO sighs] I don't think
that they'll want me here.

Do you realize what you've done?

69
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:30,708
Why did you have to
bring him along as well?!

70
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:33,208
[PRISON GUARD U] I'm sorry sir,
but I didn't have much choice.

71
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:34,791
He was there,
so I had to bring him.

72
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:36,666
[ANGUS]
It's okay.

73
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,708
So we've got more hostages...

00:06:38,791 --> 00:06:40,750
[DOKUFU]
Are you crazy? Don't you see?

75
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:43,125
This could cause a major
incident with the Empire!

76
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:45,375
Us going and kidnapping
the Administrative Director

77
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:48,000
is one thing, but a
nobleman from the Empire

78
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:49,625
is a completely
different matter!

79
00:06:49,708 --> 00:06:50,750
If that's what you think,

80
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:52,625
then you should let
his Excellency go.

81
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:55,250
And you should let me go too,
although somehow I doubt

82
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:56,458
that's going to happen.

83
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:59,625
You're absolutely right. Ha!
Releasing a mere

84
00:06:59,708 --> 00:07:02,083
Administrative Director
will accomplish nothing.

85
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:05,083
Of course, we might change our
minds if you decide to cancel

86
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:06,791
that emigration permit of yours.

87
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:09,916
I'd never do that!
It's not negotiable!

88
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,541
[ANGUS]
Do you like children?

89
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:15,250
[MEIDEEN] Why the sudden
change of subject?

90
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:19,125
Yes, I love them. So what
exactly is your point?

91
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:20,541
[ANGUS]
I love children.

92
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:22,875
I have five of my own
scattered all around.

93
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:25,125
But I'm not allowed
to see any of them.

94
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:28,166
So that's why I
want another child.

95
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:31,541
And if all the women leave,
that's not gonna be possible.

96
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:34,250
You mean all this
is just for that?!

97
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:35,625
Whaddya mean "just for that"?!

98
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:37,708
[DOKUFU] Hey, hey, hey!
Just cool it, would you?

99
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,625
Can't you see it from
his point of view?

100
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:42,625
He simply has a dream of being
the head of a happy family!

101
00:07:42,708 --> 00:07:44,166
You won't get any
sympathy from me!

102
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:46,041
If you'd lived a decent
lifestyle, no one would've

103
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:48,166
taken your children from
you in the first place!

104
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,250
And besides, what about
the children of the people

105
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:52,791
you've killed? They'll never
see their fathers again!

106
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:55,500
We have no interest in
remembering the past.

107
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:57,958
What we're interested
in is the future.

108
00:07:58,041 --> 00:08:00,000
A future where our
children can run free

109
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:02,125
across the land on Lobnas II.

110
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:05,958
And you're taking that
opportunity away from us!

111
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:07,541
[JINTO]
Excuse me. If you remember,

112
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:10,958
we could always provide you with
artificial birth technology.

113
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:13,291
Why is it so difficult
for you to understand?

114
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:15,791
A child needs a mother!

115
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:18,958
No matter how much love a father
thinks he can give his child,

116
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:22,458
it's not enough. There's always
a barrier between them.

117
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:26,583
But the love of a mother
is unconditional,

118
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:28,833
something children
intuitively recognize.

119
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:30,708
But half the Abh race
doesn't have a mother

120
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:32,666
and they seem to
be perfectly fine!

121
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:36,041
Yeah? Well maybe that explains
why you're all so screwed up!

122
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:37,625
[DOKUFU]
I'm sorry, your Excellency.

123
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:41,000
We have no intention of using
any artificial birth technology

124
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:44,583
from you or anyone else.
Have I made myself clear to you?

125
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:46,416
[MEIDEEN] In that case you
might as well forget about

126
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,083
having children altogether.
Because you don't have a choice

127
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:51,166
between artificial means
and natural means.

128
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:54,416
Your choice is to use the
artificial birth technology,

129
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,708
or look to a future
without any children at all!

130
00:08:57,791 --> 00:08:59,708
[DOKUFU] So you have no
intention of canceling

131
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:00,791
the emigration order?

132
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:02,125
No way!

133
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,833
[DOKUFU] Well, if you're
not going to cancel it...

134
00:09:03,916 --> 00:09:06,208
I am a high-ranking official
of the United Mankind

135
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:08,333
and I refuse to give in to
such threatening behavior!

136
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:10,041
I'll just have to
kill him, then.

137
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:11,416
Huh? Why me?!

138
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,416
What do you think you would
achieve by killing him?

139
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,250
You said yourself that
you don't want to cause

140
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:17,208
a major incident
with the Empire!

141
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:21,041
Killing him will mean
huge repercussions!

142
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:23,166
[DOKUFU] No one needs to
know that I was the one

143
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:26,666
who killed him. It's easy
to get lost on Lobnas II.

144
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,791
He could just happen
to "disappear"!

145
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:31,583
Along with the Administrative
Director, of course.

146
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:33,416
[MEIDEEN]
But what good would that do?

147
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,250
You're going to end up putting
yourself in an even worse

148
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:37,125
position than
you're in right now!

149
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:39,833
[DOKUFU] So will the former
residents of Lobnas II

150
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:42,583
who've already left the planet.

151
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:44,541
I haven't the slightest
idea what'll happen,

152
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,625
but we intend to
enjoy ourselves.

153
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:49,583
The emigration process
will be cancelled.

154
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:50,708
You can't do that!

155
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:52,708
Look, whatever you
decide to do to us,

156
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:55,000
you're gonna have to
pay for it in the end!

157
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:56,375
[DOKUFU]
Don't worry.

158
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:58,500
We're confident that one day
we're going to see lots

159
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:00,458
of little children
running around here!

160
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:02,791
[gasps]

161
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:05,333
Ha! Make up your mind!

162
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:06,583
I won't do it!

163
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:08,166
[chuckles]

164
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:16,125
[DOKUFU sighs] I don't think
I can bring myself to do it.

165
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:19,500
[ANGUS] Huh? Why didn't
you kill the coward?!

166
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:22,291
Because he's part of
the nobility. The Empire

167
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:24,666
would come down like a ton
of bricks if we killed him.

168
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,791
It's far too dangerous for us.

169
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:28,250
However...

170
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:30,875
There's nothing to stop me
from killing you, is there?!

171
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:34,333
You go ahead. If you kill me,
then you've got a big problem

172
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:37,916
to deal with. You won't be able
to cancel the emigration order.

173
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,250
As the new
Territorial Representative,

174
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:41,708
I'll cancel the order.

175
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,333
[MEIDEEN] I'm afraid
that's impossible.

176
00:10:43,416 --> 00:10:45,541
I've already given the
Territorial Ambassador

177
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:48,625
a list of who should succeed
me in case of emergencies.

178
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:50,708
Everyone on that list
is due to emigrate,

179
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:52,333
but as long as they
remain on this planet,

180
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:55,208
then the position of Territorial
Representative is taken.

181
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:57,125
You don't stand a chance
until every person

182
00:10:57,208 --> 00:10:58,708
on the list has left.

183
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:02,833
Ha, ha. Would I be correct in
assuming that the first person

184
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:05,166
on the list would be
someone like Tomasof?

185
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:06,708
[MEIDEEN gasps]

186
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:09,916
I can see right through you,
Director. Well, is it Tomasof?

187
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,291
It doesn't matter whose
names are on the list.

188
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:15,541
Ah, but you see it does matter.
Surely you didn't think that

189
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:18,125
he's the only one who's
moved over to our side?

190
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:20,583
No. I'm sure there're
many more like him.

191
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:22,583
But Tomasof would never
have anything to do

192
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:24,166
with the Alkaik drug trade.

193
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:27,375
So... Tomasof's name
is on the list!

194
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:29,458
[MEIDEEN]
Suit yourself.

195
00:11:29,541 --> 00:11:32,083
[DOKUFU] That's exactly
what I intend to do.

196
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:35,458
Are you sure you won't give the
order to cancel the emigration?

197
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:36,875
Of course I won't!

198
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:39,125
Then you're not needed anymore.

199
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:40,708
Don't do it...

200
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:43,416
[DOKUFU] Cancel the order and
this trigger won't get pulled.

201
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,958
[MEIDEEN] No! There's no
way I can do that!

202
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:47,875
Huh? I should have
realized this before.

203
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:49,875
Tomasof can't
be on your side.

204
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:52,375
If he was, then you would have
known already that he could

205
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:54,375
cancel the emigration order
and you wouldn't have had

206
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:56,000
any hesitation in killing me!

207
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:58,083
[DOKUFU] You may find this
difficult to believe,

208
00:11:58,166 --> 00:12:00,375
but I really dislike
having to kill people.

209
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:02,541
That's why I'm giving
you so many chances.

210
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:03,916
That's all there is to it.

211
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,125
Frankly, your friend
Tomasof will do

212
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:09,458
whatever I tell him to do.

213
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:11,958
Of course, you could save us
all a lot of time and trouble

214
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:14,375
if you just went ahead and
canceled the order yourself.

215
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:16,750
It seems like the
simplest solution to me.

216
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:20,458
I have no intention of doing so.
Tomasof would never betray me

217
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:22,416
and you're lying if
you say otherwise.

218
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,416
You're nothing but a
third rate con man!

219
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:32,541
How about I give you five more
seconds to make up your mind.

220
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:38,416
Five... Four...
Three... Two... One...

221
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,833
Time's up.

222
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:43,541
[JINTO grunts]

223
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:52,208
[JINTO]
Huh?

224
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:02,291
[grunts]

225
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:05,125
I thought this guy was
meant to be a soldier.

226
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:06,458
[DOKUFU]
He's one of those soldiers

227
00:13:06,541 --> 00:13:07,958
drawn from the nobility.

228
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:11,958
He's probably never even
seen a dead body before.

229
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,500
Why did you do that?

230
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:16,166
I may have not
liked him very much,

231
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:19,291
but at heart he was a good,
responsible person.

232
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:22,041
Why did you have to
go and kill him?!

233
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:24,458
This rebellion is a
different kind of war,

234
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:26,541
your Imperial Highness!

235
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:29,041
Even the Empire kills
huge numbers of good

236
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:31,375
and responsible people
when they are at war.

237
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:33,875
How can you criticize
us for this?!

238
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:37,833
That may be true but...
That may be true but I...

239
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:42,041
[chuckles] Now what do we
have next on our agenda?

240
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:44,666
You should go and
contact Tomasof.

241
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:46,875
Well, well. I must have
been very convincing

242
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:48,833
if you believed what
I said about him!

243
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:50,333
[JINTO]
Huh?

244
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:51,916
[DOKUFU] A do-gooder like him
would never have anything

245
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,875
to do with drugs.
Although, we shouldn't

246
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,916
underestimate him as
one of our enemies.

247
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
You tricked me, didn't you?!

248
00:13:58,083 --> 00:13:59,416
I didn't trick you!

249
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,375
It was the Administrative
Director who got tricked!

250
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:04,416
It would've been so
boring for him to die

251
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:07,541
believing his wishes would be
carried out by his own men.

252
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:10,958
That's a despicable
thing to do, Dokufu!

253
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:12,875
[JINTO]
He's right about that!

254
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:16,500
You should show some respect
for the dead, do you hear me?

255
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:18,041
We may not have
liked him very much,

256
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:20,000
but you have to admit
that guy had guts.

257
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:21,458
[PRISONERS]
Huh?

258
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:31,125
Anyway, back to business.

259
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:32,916
We've got to decide
what we'll do next.

260
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,958
Well, now we've got ourselves
stuck with this extra hostage.

261
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,291
The little coward.

262
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:39,000
Although hostages
who are cowards

263
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:40,791
can be easier to deal with.

264
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:42,166
I've already told you:

265
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:45,375
we can't afford to incur
the wrath of the Empire.

266
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:48,791
No doubt we'll end up having
to send this "nobleman" home.

267
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:52,041
I'm sure he'll be upset at the
inconvenience we've put him to,

268
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:54,500
but he'll soon forget about
a tiny incident like this

269
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:56,750
on such an unimportant planet.

270
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:58,083
I'll never forget.

271
00:14:58,166 --> 00:14:59,666
Do you think so?

272
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:02,666
I don't think I'd ever forget
having a gun held to my head.

273
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:06,125
Imagine what an impression it
would make on a coward like him!

274
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:08,791
Whether he remembers or not,
we've gotta work out how to stop

275
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:10,333
this situation from
getting any worse.

276
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:11,958
[ANGUS]
Then do something about it.

277
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:16,000
But... That's easy
enough for you to say.

278
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:17,500
You see I...

279
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,791
You see, we really don't want
the Empire to get involved

280
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:22,833
in all this, but if we were
to actively threaten you,

281
00:15:22,916 --> 00:15:25,041
could you put a stop
to the emigration process?

282
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:27,625
I'm only the Territorial
Deputy Ambassador.

283
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:29,208
I have no authority.

284
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:31,416
But you could say a few
words to help me become

285
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,166
the new Territorial
Representative?

286
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:35,833
I'm only the Territorial
Deputy Ambassador.

287
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:37,041
I have no authority.

288
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:40,041
Oh dear... now we're
in big trouble!

289
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:42,333
So who does have the authority?

290
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:44,625
[JINTO] Her Highness
the Ambassador, of course.

291
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:47,041
But she's up in orbit right now.

292
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:49,958
In that case, we threaten her
and we use him as a hostage.

293
00:15:50,041 --> 00:15:51,625
But it's far too risky!

294
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:52,791
[ANGUS]
If you can't do it,

295
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:54,500
then you're as much
of a coward as him.

296
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:57,416
If my late mother found out I'd
joined forces with such a wimp,

297
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,583
I wouldn't dare
look her in the eye.

298
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:01,916
I'd sooner kill you first.

299
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,916
[beeping]

300
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,041
Captain! It's the next
Territorial Representative.

301
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:10,416
Don't connect it.

302
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,750
--[beeping]
--[EKURYUA] Huh?

303
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:13,958
Now Supply Officer Lin
is trying to get through.

304
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:16,375
[LAFIEL]
Hm? Okay, put him on.

305
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:18,250
[EKURYUA]
He's using his Clyuno.

306
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:22,000
[DOKUFU] Is that the
Territorial Ambassador?

307
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:23,666
Who am I talking to?

308
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,833
[DOKUFU] I am the newly
inaugurated Prime Minister

309
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:28,083
of the Lobnas System,
Yuuri Dokufu.

310
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:30,500
Please, can I talk to you
by regular transmission?

311
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:34,458
This Clyuno is difficult to use,
although it's a very handy size.

312
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:37,875
Uh, Captain, it's the next
Territorial Representative.

313
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:39,333
Go ahead then.

314
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,500
I want to hear your explanation.

315
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:45,625
If by an explanation, you mean
you want to know why I am in

316
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:49,291
possession of the Territorial
Deputy Ambassador's Clyuno...

317
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:55,041
Well, you see, to put it simply,
we've kidnapped him.

318
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:58,375
[LAFIEL] Hm? Tell me
the truth. Is he alive?

319
00:16:58,458 --> 00:16:59,666
[DOKUFU]
Well, of course.

320
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,625
See for yourself.

321
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:03,583
Hi...

322
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:06,333
[LAFIEL]
Why am I not surprised, Jinto?

323
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:07,916
Now listen to our demands.

324
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:08,916
I refuse!

325
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,416
Will you at least
listen to them?

326
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,708
After all, we do have
his Excellency,

327
00:17:12,791 --> 00:17:14,916
the Deputy Ambassador,
in our custody.

328
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,875
I demand you to return
him to us. Immediately.

329
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:21,000
Well, I suppose that may
be the best solution.

330
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:23,166
[ANGUS]
No! Keep negotiating, Dokufu.

331
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,125
Do you mean to say
you're not the leader?

332
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:28,291
I want to speak directly
to whoever is in charge.

333
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:30,875
Well, technically I'm
in charge here.

334
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:33,250
At least I try my best to be.

335
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:36,500
[ANGUS] I have never worked
under your command, Dokufu!

336
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:38,416
Captain, we've analyzed
the voiceprint and we have

337
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,000
a positive identification.

338
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:43,166
It's Angus, Representative of
the Eastern Detention Sector.

339
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:47,083
He's been in communication
with us once before.

340
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:49,000
[ANGUS] We'll never return
this coward to you!

341
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:51,875
Not as long as you continue to
take the women off this planet!

342
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:53,666
Jinto is not a coward!

343
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,083
[ANGUS]
Oh yes he is.

344
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:56,666
He was even frightened at
the sight of a dead body!

345
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:59,791
Something important has happened
here that you should know about.

346
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:01,666
These guys have gone
and murdered Meideen!

347
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:03,750
You must consult the list
and find out who the next

348
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:05,000
Representative should be!

349
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:06,291
[ANGUS]
You shut up!

350
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:08,958
[LAFIEL gasps]
You'll pay for that!

351
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:11,125
[LAFIEL] I'd like to go down
to that planet right now

352
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:14,333
and with my bare hands teach
that creep exactly how those

353
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:18,166
of us who are the kin of the
stars like to exact our revenge.

354
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:20,541
Do what you want to.
I'm not afraid of dying.

355
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:23,375
If we can't breed children,
then we might as well be dead.

356
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:25,625
So stop removing the
women from this planet.

357
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:28,916
Otherwise we're gonna kill him.
No women, no Deputy-Ambassador.

358
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,625
No matter what you do to us.
Even if you somehow manage

359
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:33,666
to kill us, you'll never
get him back alive.

360
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:36,750
Kill you? Don't make me laugh!

361
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:38,958
Death would be far too
sympathetic a fate!

362
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:41,916
What do you mean by that?

363
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,291
[SOBAASH]
Well...

364
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:47,666
Perhaps I can enlighten you,
Mr. Angus, Mr. Dokufu.

365
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:50,791
You see, we believe that the
faithful execution of revenge...

366
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:54,958
...is one of the primary reasons
that we, as Abh, exist.

367
00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:57,666
If anyone is found guilty of
unjustly causing the death

368
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:00,125
of a fellow Abh, we believe
it is critical for them

369
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:02,833
to learn through experience
that there is a fate far worse

370
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:05,250
than death in this galaxy.

371
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:06,791
I believe you Angus,

372
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:09,291
when you tell us that
you're not afraid to die.

373
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:12,333
But in what form do you
visualize that death?

374
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:14,916
If you're expecting death at our
hands to consist of a bullet

375
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,416
from a gun or some sort
of lethal laser beam,

376
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,458
I'm afraid your expectations
are sorely lacking.

377
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:23,541
I guarantee you will be given
plenty of chances to recognize

378
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:25,666
just how wrong your
expectations were.

379
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:29,416
Yes, once you have learned
exactly how the Abh exact

380
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,291
their revenge, you will be
begging and pleading with us

381
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:35,833
to give you the most painful
death imaginable to mankind.

382
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:38,875
However, we don't intend
to give you that luxury.

383
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:41,000
We may not believe
in any religion,

384
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:43,750
but we do believe in
the existence of hell.

385
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:47,000
That's because in this galaxy
hell does exist and we know

386
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:50,833
that for certain, because was
created it and we control it.

387
00:19:50,916 --> 00:19:53,166
You shall experience
first hand the wrath

388
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:55,583
of the legendary
Emperor Dougnaa.

389
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:58,375
You shall see how the darkness
of science can be used

390
00:19:58,458 --> 00:20:00,500
to create the
darkness of the soul.

391
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:03,208
[DOKUFU grunts] Now just
wait a minute, will you?!

392
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:05,708
In the end, revenge produces
nothing but hatred!

393
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:07,541
That hatred fuels more hatred,

394
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:10,166
and revenge continues
in an endless cycle!

395
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,458
[SOBAASH]
That may or may not be true,

396
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:15,666
but what I do know is that our
reputation for revenge has

397
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:18,583
been an effective deterrent
against our enemies.

398
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:21,041
When I was younger,
I traveled a great deal,

399
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:23,208
visiting strange lands
and encountering many

400
00:20:23,291 --> 00:20:26,958
dangerous situations. I believe
the reason I'm still alive

401
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:30,208
is that our notoriety kept
me safer than any armor

402
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:32,500
I could use.

403
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:34,375
I sincerely hope the
same will be true

404
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:39,083
in this situation, Dokufu.
For both our sakes...

405
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:39,916
[DOKUFU]
Huh?

406
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,750
[ANGUS]
No way!

407
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:43,083
I believe in God!

408
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:45,500
And before I get thrown
into the hell He created,

409
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:48,458
it'll be good practice for me
to experience this fake hell

410
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:50,666
you've dreamt up.

411
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,500
My mind is made up.

412
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:55,208
If you take the women,
we'll take his life.

413
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:59,250
All right then.
But promise me something.

414
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:01,416
Promise me you won't
run away and die

415
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,083
before we can get to you...

416
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:05,500
[DOKUFU] I really don't
agree with this, you know.

417
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:07,625
[ANGUS] You're a bigger
coward than any of them!

418
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:09,000
[SOBAASH]
That's too bad.

419
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:11,375
But if you change your mind,
please contact us again.

420
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:13,333
[DOKUFU] Please wait!
I'm against this!

421
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:14,875
Please listen to me!

422
00:21:14,958 --> 00:21:17,291
You've got to believe that I
wanted to send him back to you!

423
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:19,250
Oh... Jinto...

424
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:23,291
[LAFIEL] I am an Abriel
and Abriels don't cry.

425
00:21:23,375 --> 00:21:26,166
I wish I wasn't an
Abriel right now!

426
00:21:29,916 --> 00:21:31,583
[EKURYUA]
Captain!

427
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:33,041
There's a transmission coming
through from the <i>Lweyses</i> .

428
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,458
It's Line Wing Aviator Samson.

429
00:21:35,541 --> 00:21:37,666
[LAFIEL]
Put him through.

430
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:41,041
[SAMSON] I'm sorry, Captain.
I should've gone with him.

431
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:42,375
[LAFIEL]
It's not your fault.

432
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:45,000
He was the one who
made the decision.

433
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:46,458
[SAMSON]
Yes, but...

434
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:48,000
[LAFIEL]
It's all right.

435
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:50,541
It's his own fault that he was
captured, and it's my fault

436
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:52,500
that I'm leaving him down there.

437
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:55,416
[SAMSON]
You intend to abandon him?!

438
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:58,208
I wanted to speak with you
expecting to receive orders to

439
00:21:58,291 --> 00:22:03,250
head straight back down to the
planet to try and rescue him!

440
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:04,875
[LAFIEL]
Come back to the ship.

441
00:22:04,958 --> 00:22:08,000
You're not equipped
for a ground battle.

442
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:10,875
[SAMSON] But Captain! They have
no intention of waging a battle

443
00:22:10,958 --> 00:22:12,458
against the Star Forces.

444
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:16,500
It would be unthinkable for them
to launch an attack against us!

445
00:22:16,583 --> 00:22:19,208
[LAFIEL]
Return to your original duties.

446
00:22:19,291 --> 00:22:20,458
[SAMSON]
Captain, please.

447
00:22:20,541 --> 00:22:23,041
Allow me to fulfill my
responsibilities to him.

448
00:22:23,125 --> 00:22:26,000
Tell you what. I won't take
my men, I'll go on my own.

449
00:22:26,083 --> 00:22:28,041
My guess is that they
really want to avoid

450
00:22:28,125 --> 00:22:30,875
getting into a fight with us.
All we need to do is provide

451
00:22:30,958 --> 00:22:32,833
them with an opportunity
to give him back.

452
00:22:32,916 --> 00:22:34,291
They've failed and they know it.

453
00:22:34,375 --> 00:22:36,083
But the thing about people
who've failed is they

454
00:22:36,166 --> 00:22:37,458
don't like to admit it.

455
00:22:37,541 --> 00:22:39,958
That's honestly how it
is down there, Captain.

456
00:22:40,041 --> 00:22:42,208
My going there will give them
a chance to return the boy

457
00:22:42,291 --> 00:22:44,375
without losing face
about their failure.

458
00:22:44,458 --> 00:22:48,500
It's a gamble, but please
give me this one chance!

459
00:22:48,583 --> 00:22:51,708
Be silent! I don't want
to hear any more talk

460
00:22:51,791 --> 00:22:53,500
from you about rescuing him.

461
00:22:53,583 --> 00:22:56,166
You're not
responsible here, I am!

462
00:22:56,250 --> 00:23:00,583
Please be quiet,
Samson Bolge Tilsal Tiluse!

463
00:24:47,541 --> 00:24:49,375
Otherwise I'll forget about him.

464
00:24:49,458 --> 00:24:51,958
[ANGUS] Well now we have a
reason for holding him captive

465
00:24:52,041 --> 00:24:53,958
as a hostage, don't we?

466
00:24:54,041 --> 00:24:56,666
[DOKUFU] I said, "Let go of
the Deputy Ambassador!"

467
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:58,375
[ginshot]

468
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:02,875
[SPOOR]
Please explain...

469
00:25:02,958 --> 00:25:05,875
But we Spoors can
see through it all.

470
00:25:05,958 --> 00:25:08,708
Would you? Your Highness?

471
00:25:08,791 --> 00:25:10,791
[LAFIEL] That's the first
time she's ever called me

472
00:25:10,875 --> 00:25:12,291
"Your Highness".
