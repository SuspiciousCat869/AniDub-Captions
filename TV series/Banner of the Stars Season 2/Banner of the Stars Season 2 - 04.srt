[TREKSES CREW 1]
This is the Star Forces

00:00:21,541 --> 00:00:23,833
Transport Ship Trekses.
Leaving port.

3
00:00:23,916 --> 00:00:25,791
[GROUND CONTRO] The route
ahead is free of obstruction.

4
00:00:25,875 --> 00:00:27,541
You are cleared to
prepare for take off.

5
00:00:27,625 --> 00:00:30,208
Thank you. Commence preparations
for take off!

6
00:00:30,291 --> 00:00:31,875
[TREKSES CAPTAIN] This is
a message from the bridge of

7
00:00:31,958 --> 00:00:34,083
the Trekses for all those
of you who are emigrating.

8
00:00:34,166 --> 00:00:36,625
In a moment we will be taking
off and you will experience

9
00:00:36,708 --> 00:00:39,125
approximately twice the
normal level of gravity.

10
00:00:39,208 --> 00:00:41,750
Once we arrive in our satellite
orbit, you will be momentarily

11
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:44,416
weightless until we can
re-adjust our gravity control.

12
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,916
Please remain calm at all times.

Heading toward take off area.

15
00:00:52,625 --> 00:00:53,875
[GROUND CONTROL]
Trekses! You have permission

16
00:00:53,958 --> 00:00:56,458
to take off as soon as you
have passed the airship.

17
00:00:56,541 --> 00:00:57,583
[TREKSES CREW 2]
Preparations complete.

18
00:00:57,666 --> 00:00:59,041
Starting the engines!

19
00:01:00,833 --> 00:01:03,000
Twenty seconds until take off.

20
00:01:03,083 --> 00:01:05,125
[TREKSES CREW 2]
Engine output at 75 per cent.

21
00:01:05,208 --> 00:01:06,666
All systems operational.

22
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:09,708
[TREKSES CREW 1] We are now at
optimum speed for take off.

23
00:01:09,791 --> 00:01:11,500
[TREKSES CREW 3]
Ten seconds to take off.

24
00:01:11,583 --> 00:01:15,666
[TREKSES CREW 3]
Eight... Seven... Six... Five...

25
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:19,750
Four... Three... Two... One...

26
00:01:19,833 --> 00:01:21,166
And take off!

27
00:01:25,791 --> 00:01:28,958
[JINTO] So now we've managed
to move over 15,000 people.

28
00:01:29,041 --> 00:01:30,875
Everything's going
according to plan.

29
00:01:30,958 --> 00:01:31,791
[EKURYUA]
Roger.

30
00:01:31,875 --> 00:01:32,875
[JINTO]
Right, what's next...

31
00:01:32,958 --> 00:01:34,375
[JINTO yelps]

32
00:01:34,458 --> 00:01:36,416
[JINTO]
Ow!

33
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:37,750
What is it?

34
00:01:39,583 --> 00:01:40,875
I've been attacked!

35
00:01:40,958 --> 00:01:42,500
By a prisoner?

36
00:01:42,583 --> 00:01:43,666
[JINTO]
Everything's fine.

37
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:46,583
Its weapons are
fairly primitive... Ouch!

38
00:01:46,666 --> 00:01:47,958
Are you okay down there?

39
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:50,458
[JINTO] This thing's got
thorns all over its body.

40
00:01:50,541 --> 00:01:52,333
Whoa! It just spat at me!

41
00:01:52,416 --> 00:01:53,583
Have I got this right?

42
00:01:53,666 --> 00:01:56,166
It has weapons,
thorns on its body, and spits?

43
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:57,875
[JINTO]
Oh no! There's more of them!

44
00:01:57,958 --> 00:01:59,625
Ow! Ouch! Get off me!

45
00:01:59,708 --> 00:02:01,000
Is it a rebellion?

46
00:02:01,083 --> 00:02:02,541
[SAMSON laughs]

47
00:02:02,625 --> 00:02:04,958
[SAMSON] It might be more
interesting if it was!

48
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:46,458
[EKURYUA]
This is Assault Ship <i>Basroil</i> .

49
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:50,666
We are commencing coupling
with Orbital Station 10885.

50
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:54,250
The first pressurization
bay is ready to dock.

51
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:57,333
[LAFIEL] Looks like we're
here for the long haul.

52
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:59,541
I guess the fact that they've
sent an orbital station

53
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:01,125
instead of a
human administrator,

54
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:04,708
means that HQ believes this is
going to be a long-term mission.

55
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,583
[LAFIEL]
Yes, I suppose we're going to

56
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:09,291
have to be ready for anything.

57
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:11,958
[SOBAASH] It's been two months
since we arrived in this system.

58
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:14,625
I'm actually quite glad they've
sent this orbital station.

59
00:04:14,708 --> 00:04:16,791
It helps to break the monotony.

60
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:18,250
[EKURYUA]
Captain!

61
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:20,708
Transfer operations from the
Trekses are starting now.

62
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:25,541
[LAFIEL]
Deploying the transport ships

63
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:28,416
one after another really
helps speed things along.

64
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,208
You have to admit
that Fleet Command

65
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:32,541
is handling
this very nicely.

66
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:37,375
[SOBAASH] Well, yes. But don't
you think it's a bit strange?

67
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:38,541
What do you mean?

68
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:39,875
Didn't you notice?

69
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:41,250
That communication ship we
deployed the other day

70
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:43,708
hasn't returned and
has yet to report.

71
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:45,458
So do you think
something unexpected

72
00:04:45,541 --> 00:04:47,416
might have happened
to them on the way?

73
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:51,000
It's a possibility. I think
we should assume the worst.

74
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:52,125
[LAFIEL]
Hmm...

75
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:56,708
[NEFEE]
Taking a quick nap, Nereis?

76
00:04:57,916 --> 00:04:59,791
Actually I wasn't sleeping.

77
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:03,291
I was just taking time out
to appreciate some art.

78
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:06,791
You surprise me. That's the sort
of hobby normal people have.

79
00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:12,916
Interesting... I think
I've felt this before.

80
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,500
However, I'm sure I remember
it having some sort of

81
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:16,875
music as well.

82
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:19,750
[NEREIS] Can't you just
enjoy art in its pure form?

83
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:24,000
Music is an unnecessary
addition for area sensor art.

84
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:26,625
[NEFEE] What a mediocre
opinion coming from you.

85
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:30,166
It goes against my conscience
to even argue with you.

86
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:33,416
But I know what I like
and I like composite art.

87
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:39,083
[NEREIS] Yes, but I believe
that each individual thing

88
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:40,541
has a beauty of its own

89
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:44,416
which is lost when it is
combined with other things.

90
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,250
[NEFEE] That's where
I think you're wrong.

91
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:49,125
The beauty of art is exactly
how the artist chooses

92
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:51,916
to synthesize all the
various elements.

93
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,291
[NEREIS]
Enough of this.

94
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:55,000
I'm sure you didn't
come here to ruin

95
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:57,500
my relaxation with
your opinions about art.

96
00:05:57,583 --> 00:06:01,000
No. We've received a report
I think you should know about.

97
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:02,708
[NEREIS]
Good news?

98
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:05,208
[NEFEE] That depends
on how you look at it.

99
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:07,250
[NEREIS] If I said I
don't want to hear it,

100
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:08,875
would you be surprised?

101
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:09,916
[NEFEE]
Of course.

102
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,291
[NERIES]
Huh?

103
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:13,625
[NEFEE] As long as you let
us handle the situation.

104
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:15,833
No, wait! You'd better tell me!

105
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:18,541
It's funny, but I thought
you'd say that.

106
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:22,750
We've spotted an enemy fleet
passing through Ryureem Gate 13.

107
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:25,208
There appear to be 40 squadrons.

108
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:26,583
[NEREIS]
Which way are they heading?

109
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:28,750
[NEFEE] Towards the Milky
Way Gate, of course.

110
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:31,083
With the intention of escaping.

111
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:34,625
[NEREIS]
What?

112
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:36,875
You mean they aren't planning
to surround and destroy us?

113
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:39,416
[NEFEE] The enemy commander
obviously has far more

114
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,208
common sense than you.

115
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:43,583
[NEREIS] What a pity.
Ever since Aptic, I've grown

116
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:46,291
rather fond of fighting
in defense of the Empire!

117
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:48,708
Is that why you insisted
on advancing forward

118
00:06:48,791 --> 00:06:51,333
despite all our advice
and pleas to stop?

119
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:54,000
Our troops aren't
your puppets, Nereis.

120
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:56,208
Of course, there's no way I
would endanger their lives

121
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:57,583
without good reason.

122
00:06:57,666 --> 00:06:59,750
So long as our fleet is
keeping the enemy occupied,

123
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:02,833
the overall losses will
be kept to a minimum.

124
00:07:02,916 --> 00:07:05,666
I was under the impression I'd
already explained that to you.

125
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,458
[NEFEE] You're talking
about overall losses

126
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:08,708
to Operation Hunter.

127
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:11,541
But your responsibility
is to the Fourth Fleet.

128
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:13,083
[NEREIS]
I'm disappointed, Nefee.

129
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:15,958
Are you saying it's okay as
long as you're not in danger?

130
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:18,583
[NEFEE] Alright then, if I can't
persuade you to see things from

131
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:20,333
my point of view,
have you thought about

132
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:21,791
what the enemy might think?

133
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:23,416
Actually I have
thought of that.

134
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,541
Even if ultimately
they're not going to win,

135
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:27,166
if we let them surround
us for a while,

136
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:29,291
they'll feel like they've
achieved something.

137
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:32,125
In my memoirs I think I'm going
to write something along

138
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:34,375
the lines of, "We were
preparing to be annihilated

139
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:35,583
by a worthy foe."

140
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:37,666
What do you want
to write that for?

141
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,500
What do you mean?
Isn't it obvious?

142
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:41,791
I knew that suffering from
a lack of common sense

143
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:43,708
was one of your many
character flaws,

144
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:46,083
but I didn't realize
you had no insight.

145
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:48,791
The reason I want to write that
in my memoir is because--

146
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:51,375
[NEFEE] Is because you want any
enemy survivors reading your

147
00:07:51,458 --> 00:07:53,666
memoir to be filled with
pride that their battles

148
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:56,375
were not in vain.
Something along those lines?

149
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:58,708
So you did understand what
I was saying after all.

150
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:00,958
I was starting to get
worried about you.

151
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:03,666
I was vainly hoping you wouldn't
be capable of acting

152
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,208
in such an evil way

153
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:07,500
Evil? That's a very strong word.

154
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:09,625
I know deep down you're
concerned about the welfare

155
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:11,500
of your troops,
in your own way.

156
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:14,458
That's right. Although I worry
about exactly what you mean by,

157
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:15,833
"in your own way."

158
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:18,458
You're actually worried?
It's not like you at all.

159
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:20,833
But whatever you do, don't think
you have an obligation

160
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:22,541
to be considerate towards me.

161
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:24,375
Since when have I
ever made an effort

162
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:26,833
to be considerate
towards you?

163
00:08:26,916 --> 00:08:30,000
Never. At least not that
I've noticed, anyway.

164
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:31,208
[NEREIS]
Exactly.

165
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:33,625
I'll try my best to
carry on just like that.

166
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:35,250
[NEFEE]
Well that's a relief.

167
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:37,791
Shouldn't we be deciding what
to should about the enemy?

168
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:39,250
[NEREIS]
You're right.

169
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:41,041
I don't want to give them
the impression that I simply

170
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:42,708
allowed them to get away.

171
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:44,291
Then again, maybe I
shouldn't write about

172
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:46,000
this incident at all.

173
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:49,291
Let's just forget about
these stupid memoirs

174
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:50,875
for a moment, shall we?

175
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:54,041
What I was asking was: how shall
we deal with this enemy fleet?

176
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:56,083
Isn't there anything
left for us to do here?

177
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:58,000
Something we need
to take care of?

178
00:08:58,083 --> 00:08:59,958
I don't suppose there're
any other squadrons

179
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:01,708
near the enemy's current route?

180
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:04,625
[NEFEE] No. Both the supply
ships and the front line ships

181
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:07,916
are too far away. The enemy is
passing throught the huge gap

182
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
between them. But are
you sure you don't want

183
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:10,875
to go after them?

184
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:12,208
[NEREIS]
Will you just stop?

185
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:14,458
I'm sure the General Fleet
will deal with it.

186
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:16,083
The enemy knows
that their escape

187
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:18,458
is a last ditch act
of desperation.

188
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:19,875
If we were to go after them,

189
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:22,291
it would appear as though
we were bullying the weak.

190
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:24,666
[NEFEE] They aren't as
weak as you think.

191
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:27,375
[NEREIS] All the more reason
not to attack, Nefee.

192
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:29,416
Chasing after them would
be a waste of time.

193
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,083
What's the point in risking
losses to our own side?

194
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:35,166
Besides, I don't want to give my
readers the impression that

195
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,250
I staged this whole
thing as some sort of

196
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:39,625
quick fix for the situation.

197
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:43,083
Can't you be serious about
the situation for a moment?

198
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:45,208
Now you don't want
us to do anything?

199
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:47,375
Well, maybe we should let
the command in Dalmav

200
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:50,291
know about this. And we should
order all those squadrons

201
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:52,416
behind us to not try
anything stupid.

202
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,333
They should retreat if
looks like the enemy

203
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:55,666
might launch an attack.

204
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,708
As for us, we'll keep
pushing forward.

205
00:09:57,791 --> 00:09:59,958
Especially now we know there
aren't any enemy forces

206
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:01,166
ahead of us.

207
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:03,041
Besides the other fleets
will find out about

208
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:04,416
the enemy's movements soon

209
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,500
and the competition
will get even tougher.

210
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:07,833
Wait. What are you saying?

211
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:10,541
You want us to be the
first ones to arrive?

212
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:12,666
[NEREIS]
It would be a great honor.

213
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:16,000
[NEREIS]
You see, Nefee?

214
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:20,166
I have the honor of the Fourth
Fleet at heart after all.

215
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:22,375
[KUFADIS] Looking at all the
information we have gathered,

216
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:24,916
it appears the enemy forces have
slipped through the front line

217
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,416
at the Milky Way Gate

218
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,958
and are now advancing towards
the center of the system.

219
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:32,708
[KUFADIS] They are periodically
stealing fuel from the civilian

220
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:34,416
anti-matter factories
in the area,

221
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,458
which is delaying
their progress.

222
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:38,125
But even taking
that into account,

223
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:40,500
they still aren't
traveling very fast.

224
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:42,791
Their escape is probably being
hindered by the slow moving

225
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:45,000
supply squadrons
accompanying them.

226
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:45,666
In the end it all--

227
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,250
Now let me guess.

228
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:49,875
The enemy fleet would like to be
reunited with its main fleet?

229
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:52,000
It is the most likely strategy.

230
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:55,250
[SPOOR] Is that so? There was
little old me thinking

231
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:58,250
they wanted to
abandon their fleet.

232
00:10:58,333 --> 00:11:00,625
What would they do once
they'd abandoned it?

233
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:02,250
[SPOOR] They could go
down to the ground world

234
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:04,125
and do whatever they
liked down there.

235
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:06,791
Unlike us, they don't have
any particular reason

236
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,625
to carry on being in space.

237
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:10,958
In this case it looks
like they do.

238
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:13,333
[KUFADIS] They also have a need
to protect their interests.

239
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:15,208
And will instinctively
fight to the end

240
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:16,833
to achieve that goal.

241
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:19,000
Surely every soldier
thinks like that.

242
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:21,625
Of course, there are
always exceptions.

243
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:24,458
Have we finished everything
here that we need to do?

244
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:26,416
[KUFADIS] According to the
orders that we were given,

245
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:30,208
our job is to continue observing
what's left of the enemy forces.

246
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:32,333
In addition to that, we are
to continue patrolling

247
00:11:32,416 --> 00:11:33,625
the front lines and report back.

248
00:11:33,708 --> 00:11:35,125
Okay, I know, I know.

249
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:37,791
But there's nothing
really for us do!

250
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:41,208
The war in Operation Hunter
is effectively over.

251
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:42,916
[KUFADIS]
You could well be right.

252
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,833
We may not have much of the
enemy left to deal with now,

253
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:48,541
but until we are able to conquer
all of the territories within

254
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,291
the sphere of Operation Hunter;

255
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:53,000
until we are able to reclaim all
the planets conquered by the

256
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:57,750
enemy four years ago;
the war will still be going on.

257
00:11:57,833 --> 00:11:59,958
[KUFADIS] I thought she had set
her heart on fighting a battle

258
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:03,291
no matter what the circumstance,
but maybe she'll just stay

259
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:05,833
safely behind the
scenes this time.

260
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:07,958
You suddenly look
very happy, Chief.

261
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:09,333
[KUFADIS]
Huh? Oh no!

262
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:11,666
It's just the mission
seems to have settled down.

263
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,375
I'm glad it makes you so happy.

264
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:15,958
For me it's just more
boredom as usual.

265
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:17,708
Nothing to do but sit and wait.

266
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,541
[YAWNS]

267
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:21,541
[SPOOR] I suppose we should
prioritize observing

268
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:23,708
the remnants of the enemy
fleet as they escape.

269
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:26,291
When are you going to supply
the operation plans?

270
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:28,791
Would you be willing to
give authorization for us

271
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:31,625
to start moving in the same
direction as the enemy fleet?

272
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:33,416
[SPOOR]
Of course, Chief of Staff.

273
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,500
Then we'll leave in
the next six hours.

274
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:37,916
[SPOOR] But make sure that we,
here on the flagship,

275
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,458
are accompanied by as
many ships as possible.

276
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:44,125
[KUFADIS] So she is planning to
enter into battle after all.

277
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:45,333
Did you hear me?

278
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:47,250
[KUFADIS]
Uh! Yes Ma'am!

279
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,458
[TRIFE]
Why exactly did the Fourth Fleet

280
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:55,791
let the enemy slip
past them like that?

281
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:58,750
[KAHYUL] I expect they simply
didn't respond quickly enough.

282
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:00,208
[TRIFE]
Really? If that's the case,

283
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:02,125
then there's nothing we
can do about it now.

284
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:04,541
Hm. But they didn't even
try to go after them.

285
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:07,000
They made no effort whatsoever.

286
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:10,500
I don't understand. What was
Admiral Bebaus thinking?!

287
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:12,000
If they'd gone after them,

288
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:14,208
they'd have suffered heavy
losses and gained very little.

289
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:15,750
I expect they realized this

290
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:18,041
and I believe they
made a sensible choice.

291
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:19,541
It may have been sensible,

292
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:21,916
but I don't agree it
was the right choice.

293
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,458
If they had annihilated the
remainder of the enemy fleet,

294
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:27,625
Operation Hunter would
have been complete.

295
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:29,791
We could still do it...

296
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:32,083
But I only have 43
squadrons at my command.

297
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:34,916
It's possible that the main
fleet of the Triple Alliance

298
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,500
could synchronize its forces
to attempt some sort of

299
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:40,708
pincer movement against the
enemy ships that are remaining.

300
00:13:40,791 --> 00:13:43,583
But if we simply station a large
detachment on the front line,

301
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:45,875
then that will give a signal
to the enemy's command

302
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:48,583
that some of their fleet is
trying to escape from us.

303
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:50,791
[TRIFE] I see. I do understand
what you're saying.

304
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:54,875
It makes sense.
But I'm still not satisfied.

305
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:56,791
[KAHYUL]
The enemy has 40 squadrons.

306
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:58,791
That's too many for us to say
that we would have a sure

307
00:13:58,875 --> 00:14:00,916
advantage if we attacked.

308
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,875
But they likely have a large
number of supply ships

309
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:07,333
within those 40 squadrons.
The chances are good

310
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:11,708
that their actual firepower
is a lot less than ours.

311
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:13,666
I agree but we don't
know for sure.

312
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,625
It's pure conjecture
and we shouldn't make

313
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:17,333
any assumptions now.

314
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:19,541
[KAHYUL] Very well.
In that case we need to wait

315
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:22,583
for a reconnaissance
report from Admiral Spoor.

316
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:25,000
[TRIFE] It's possible we may
not get the information in time

317
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:28,791
before we have to fight. We have
no idea what may happen.

318
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:30,833
[KAHYUL] Discovering the
strength of the enemy forces

319
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:33,416
is a top priority for the
reconnaissance missions.

320
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,833
There's no way they'd allow
us to enter into battle

321
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:38,791
without the appropriate
intelligence information.

322
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:42,666
We can't rely too
heavily on that.

323
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:45,291
There's a long tradition between
the commanders in the Star

324
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:48,458
Forces of being uncooperative
toward each other.

325
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:49,708
[KAHYUL]
Come on.

326
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:53,291
Calling it a tradition
is going a bit too far.

327
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:55,458
Damn it! What do I care
if the enemy's command

328
00:14:55,541 --> 00:14:57,500
finds out that there
are survivors?

329
00:14:57,583 --> 00:15:00,333
All I'm interested in is getting
enough of our forces together

330
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:02,958
to annihilate what's left
of them! It's that simple!

331
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:05,208
If only I had double the
strength right now...

332
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:06,916
I see...

333
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,750
And what exactly do
you mean by that?

334
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:10,541
Just that I think
I'm beginning to see

335
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:11,958
what you meant
about the tradition

336
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:14,333
of being uncooperative
with each other.

337
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:16,875
That's all I meant.
Nothing more, nothing less.

338
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:19,375
That's good. I'm so
pleased you understand.

339
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:22,583
Yes, it's all becoming
crystal clear to me now.

340
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:24,708
I'm relieved to hear it.

341
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:26,500
We should plan our strategy
on the assumption that

342
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:29,458
the entire enemy fleet is
made up of elite forces.

343
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:31,041
We therefore need to
think carefully before

344
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:32,583
attacking them head on.

345
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:35,416
I hope you don't mind me asking,
but are you feeling well?

346
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,083
Yes, I've never felt better.

347
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:38,500
What's the point
of your question?

348
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:40,083
You have to admit it's
rather unusual for

349
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:42,500
your Excellency to
be so cautious.

350
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:44,833
What else do you suggest I
do? Attack our allies

351
00:15:44,916 --> 00:15:46,708
so I can commandeer
the use of their ships?!

352
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:48,250
I would strongly
advise you against

353
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:49,791
taking that course of action.

354
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:52,375
I wouldn't want to put myself
in the unfortunate position

355
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:55,458
of having to charge my
senior officer with treason.

356
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:58,375
Maybe you should simply wait
and let someone else charge me.

357
00:15:58,458 --> 00:15:59,916
Save yourself the trouble.

358
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,333
[KAHYUL]
What for?

359
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:02,916
[TRIFE]
Hmph.

360
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,375
Never mind. We'll stick with
a mobile defense pattern

361
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:08,500
and each time we inflict
damage on the enemy ships,

362
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:09,875
we'll retreat again.

363
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:12,083
I want you to plan our
strategy with that in mind.

364
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:14,000
Yes sir, right away.

365
00:16:15,916 --> 00:16:19,166
[JINTO] You want us to
suspend the emigration?

366
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:22,083
[LAFIEL] Yes, the communication
ship from the Fourth Fleet

367
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:23,500
has arrived.

368
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:26,625
We've been ordered to evacuate
the area temporarily.

369
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:28,750
[JINTO] I know that if the
enemy is in the vicinity,

370
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:32,708
we should do everything we can
to avoid any risk of attack.

371
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:34,833
[JINTO sighs] But it's going to
be hard to convince all these

372
00:16:34,916 --> 00:16:36,375
people of that...

373
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:38,958
The plan is for us to withdraw
from the area on the 17th

374
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:42,333
standard day and then to
return again on the 60th day.

375
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:45,375
Tell the people that we intend
to continue with the emigration

376
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:48,083
process as soon as we return.

377
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:52,125
Well, okay.
I'll try to do my best.

378
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:53,416
This is irresponsible!

379
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,916
You come here saying
you'll help us

380
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,583
and then leave us at
a moment's notice!

381
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:58,125
It's unacceptable!

382
00:16:58,208 --> 00:17:00,083
Absolutely! You've gone
and ruined my chances

383
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:01,416
of getting off this planet!

384
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,958
No... you see--

385
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:04,666
[MEIDEEN] What you don't realize
is that most of the staff's

386
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:05,875
families have already
been shipped

387
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,416
to your prisoner of war camps.

388
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,083
If we suspend the
emigration now,

389
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:11,208
the staff may never see
their wives, husbands,

390
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:12,625
or their children again!

391
00:17:12,708 --> 00:17:15,000
I know that the Abh don't hold
families in high regard,

392
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:16,791
but for us it's different!

393
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:19,583
For some of our people, being
separated from their family

394
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:21,208
is a fate worse than death!

395
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:24,000
This is only temporary.
We'll be back as soon as we can!

396
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:26,125
[MEIDEEN]
How do we know we can trust you?

397
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:28,125
The only information we
get on what's happening

398
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:29,750
in space is from you.

399
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:32,291
It's possible that you're
keeping something from us.

400
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:33,875
You say it's only temporary,

401
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:36,208
but maybe you're never
going to return!

402
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:38,833
Which would leave the planet
open for the United Mankind

403
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:42,125
to come back and take
control once more.

404
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:44,833
If that happens, the staff and
their families will be living

405
00:17:44,916 --> 00:17:46,208
under the control
of different nations

406
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:47,833
who are at war with each other!

407
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:49,833
Can't you understand
what that means?

408
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:55,541
[JINTO]
Huh?

409
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:58,250
Actually... I do understand.

410
00:17:58,333 --> 00:18:00,625
Given the current circumstances,
I believe the best course of

411
00:18:00,708 --> 00:18:03,208
action would be if we were
the ones who took priority

412
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:04,583
in the emigration.

413
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,625
Because once the United
Mankind comes back

414
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:08,500
and takes control,
it's almost guaranteed

415
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:10,750
we'll be treated just
like criminals again.

416
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:12,583
Treated like criminals?
What arrogance!

417
00:18:12,666 --> 00:18:14,083
You are criminals!

418
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:16,625
You have been proven guilty
beyond any reasonable doubt!

419
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:18,125
You're prisoners!

420
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:19,041
[JINTO]
Ahem.

421
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:20,291
[MEIDEEN]
Whatever happens,

422
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:22,125
we have no power to
stop you leaving.

423
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:24,791
But we ask that you finish
the emigration before you do.

424
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:26,625
Before you evacuate,
we want you to ensure

425
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:28,625
that we are all moved
off this planet.

426
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:31,083
Please don't forget
to take us as well.

427
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:33,791
I understand your concerns.
We'll do our best.

428
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:36,708
[MEIDEEN]
Do your best?! Is that all?!

429
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:38,208
[JINTO]
That's all.

430
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:40,875
Until we know what's happening
with the transport ship,

431
00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:43,250
we can't tell if we will be
able to move all the people

432
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:46,416
who wish to emigrate before
the deadline for evacuation.

433
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,166
[MEIDEEN] I insist that you
help us emigrate before then!

434
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:51,416
[JINTO] I find it hard to
understand what you,

435
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,166
as the Territorial
Representative,

436
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:54,708
are so worried about.

437
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:57,083
I know that some of your staff
have already been moved off

438
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:59,875
the planet, but you allowed all
their families and the less

439
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:02,416
important staff to
leave first, right?

440
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:05,250
As far as I can see, you still
have all the people and supplies

441
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:07,250
you need to run the island
efficiently for at least

442
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:08,625
another two months.

443
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:10,500
[MEIDEEN] But we have no
guarantee that it will only

444
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:12,541
be two months
before you return!

445
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:14,500
Shall I tell you what the
Administrative Director

446
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:17,458
is afraid of? What's really
behind all this?

447
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:19,000
What? What is it?

448
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:20,583
[MEIDEEN] Why don't you
save your breath?!

449
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:22,541
I intend to nominate
you as the next

450
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:24,125
Territorial Representative.

451
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:26,125
Think about the honor
of this planet!

452
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:28,250
[SHANGAL]
The honor of this planet?!

453
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:29,666
That's about right.

454
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:32,250
What would the Territorial
Deputy Ambassador give me

455
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:34,041
in return for my information?

456
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:37,791
Well, it's not something I think
I want to concern myself with.

457
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:39,333
That's a shame.

458
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:42,125
Now what's all this about being
Territorial Representative,

459
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:44,875
Mr. Director? I thought you
didn't like the title?

460
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:48,125
I don't mind you taking my title
of Territorial Representative

461
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:50,041
because then you won't
sully the good name

462
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:52,958
of the office of the
Administrative Director.

463
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:55,625
And it won't be
for long, anyway.

464
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:57,958
So you do believe
we'll be coming back.

465
00:19:58,041 --> 00:19:59,541
[MEIDEEN]
That's not the point.

466
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:01,958
If the Abh don't return,
then we'll be under the control

467
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:03,958
of the United Mankind
and the title of

468
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:07,083
Territorial Representative
will become redundant.

469
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:10,291
If that happens I may not
see my family again...

470
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:13,666
I see. Try to believe
we'll do our best.

471
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:16,125
That's all I can promise
for the time being.

472
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:18,416
Well, I don't suppose
we have much choice.

473
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,833
After all, you're in charge.

474
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:22,750
[JINTO]
I guess he's right...

475
00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:30,791
[LAFIEL] Three more days
until we evacuate.

476
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:42,708
[JINTO] In the end, things
didn't go according to plan.

477
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:47,750
[JINTO]
This is beautiful.

478
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:50,166
I wish she could be
here to see this view.

479
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:06,625
[LAFIEL]
It's been a long time...

480
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:09,791
...since we actually saw
each other in person.

481
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,250
--[beeping]
--[JINTO] Huh?

482
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:13,958
[MEIDEEN] Is that His
Excellency the Count?

483
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:14,875
Yes.

484
00:21:14,958 --> 00:21:15,916
[MEIDEEN]
It's a rebellion!

485
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:16,833
We need your
assistance immediately!

486
00:21:16,916 --> 00:21:19,333
[JINTO]
Hm? Yes. I'm on my way.

487
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:22,583
This is how it should be.

488
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:28,125
[shouting, grunting]

489
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:31,666
We're under attack!
We need help!

490
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,708
So you thought you were
gonna leave without us?!

491
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:36,041
Your leaving women
behind for us!

492
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:40,958
[PRISON GUARDS yell]

493
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:46,000
[PRISONERS yell]

494
00:21:48,958 --> 00:21:50,541
Take that, suckers!

495
00:21:53,958 --> 00:21:56,333
[SAMSON]
Come on everybody!

496
00:21:56,416 --> 00:21:59,583
I thought I told you guys this
was not a recreational trip!

497
00:21:59,666 --> 00:22:03,166
Oh Line Wing Aviator...
I can't drink anymore.

498
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:05,708
[SAMSON] Of all the times to
get drunk, they choose now!

499
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,833
[grunts]

500
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:16,541
The Eastern Detention
Sector has launched an attack

501
00:22:16,625 --> 00:22:18,375
against the Central
Detention Sector.

502
00:22:18,458 --> 00:22:20,541
Huh? What happened to
all the armed guards?

503
00:22:20,625 --> 00:22:22,583
What do you think?
They're fighting back!

504
00:22:26,625 --> 00:22:28,250
But if that's the case,
then we havent got

505
00:22:28,333 --> 00:22:30,083
anything to worry about.

506
00:22:30,166 --> 00:22:32,041
Their weapons must
have been home made.

507
00:22:32,125 --> 00:22:36,083
They can't be as powerful as
regular weapons, can they?

508
00:22:36,166 --> 00:22:38,500
[MEIDEEN] They have
regular weapons as well!

509
00:22:46,666 --> 00:22:47,916
But how did that happen?

510
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,708
Well, we have a traitor
in our midst.

511
00:22:49,791 --> 00:22:52,500
Someone among the staff
who wanted to stay behind.

512
00:22:52,583 --> 00:22:54,083
Administrative Director,

513
00:22:54,166 --> 00:22:56,000
do you mean to say
that the leader is...

514
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:59,625
You're right. I don't
need to tell you.

515
00:22:59,708 --> 00:23:00,958
It's him.

516
00:23:01,041 --> 00:23:02,375
[ANGUS chuckles]

517
00:24:46,458 --> 00:24:47,791
[SHANGAL]
Huh?

518
00:24:47,875 --> 00:24:49,750
[MEIDEEN] I just don't
understand the logic that these

519
00:24:49,833 --> 00:24:51,916
prisoners are using
in this situation!

520
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,333
[SHANGAL] Don't treat me like
I'm one of Angus's men.

521
00:24:54,416 --> 00:24:55,583
--[JINTO] Uh...
--[SHANGAL] Huh?

522
00:24:55,666 --> 00:24:57,041
If there's anything
we can do to help you

523
00:24:57,125 --> 00:25:00,125
resolve this situation,
we're ready to help.

524
00:25:00,208 --> 00:25:02,083
[JINTO] I thought I
learned my lesson in Aptic

525
00:25:02,166 --> 00:25:05,083
that being a hero
wasn't really my style.

526
00:25:05,166 --> 00:25:06,666
[TOMASOF] So now the
second wall is being attacked

527
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:08,958
from two sides: the Eastern
and the Central Sectors!

528
00:25:09,041 --> 00:25:11,625
I think this is becoming
too interesting...
