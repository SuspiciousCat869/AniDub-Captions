1
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,958
[NARRATOR speaking in Baronh]

2
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:18,000
[PRISON GUARD 16A] Let's move!
We're already behind schedule.

3
00:01:18,083 --> 00:01:21,416
[PRISON GUARDS chattering]

4
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,416
There!

5
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,750
[PRISON GUARD 16C]
All right! I got it!

6
00:01:25,833 --> 00:01:26,625
[PRISON GUARD 16E]
Packing complete!

7
00:01:26,708 --> 00:01:28,125
The ship is now ready!

8
00:01:28,208 --> 00:01:31,458
This is ship number three.
We've started loading.

9
00:01:31,541 --> 00:01:32,958
[OFFICER 16A]
Ship number one has finished.

10
00:01:33,041 --> 00:01:35,958
Let's prioritize ship number two
next and then in sequence.

11
00:01:36,041 --> 00:01:37,916
[FAZUN] Can't we get the
squadrons to hurry up here?

12
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,750
[OFFICER 16A] Ms. Fazun!
The Ambassador has arrived!

13
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:41,250
Okay.

14
00:01:43,666 --> 00:01:46,000
[JINTO] Considering this
is just a food delivery,

15
00:01:46,083 --> 00:01:48,500
things are pretty
heavily guarded here.

16
00:01:48,583 --> 00:01:51,333
[FAZUN] Actually, we're worried
it may not be enough.

17
00:01:51,416 --> 00:01:53,333
All ships are now
ready to depart.

18
00:01:53,416 --> 00:01:56,000
All right then,
let's get out of here.

19
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:06,708
So, all we have to do
is get 20,000 people off

20
00:02:06,791 --> 00:02:08,416
this planet, organize
their transport,

21
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,500
and decide where they're going.

22
00:02:10,583 --> 00:02:13,166
[SAMSON sighs] I'm exhausted
just thinkin' about it!

23
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:14,666
If I were the Ambassador,

24
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:16,500
I think I'd just hang around
up here on the <i>Basroil</i>

25
00:02:16,583 --> 00:02:19,083
until the proper
Administrator came along.

26
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:22,083
I must admit,
I like the sound of that!

27
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:23,166
What's down there?

28
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,333
[FAZUN]
They're watchtowers.

29
00:02:24,416 --> 00:02:26,208
Not even a piece of
wood can float past

30
00:02:26,291 --> 00:02:27,750
without us knowing about it.

31
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:29,666
[SAMSON] Even if someone
got past the watchtowers,

32
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,208
where would they escape to?!

33
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:32,833
You could get to
the other sectors.

34
00:02:32,916 --> 00:02:34,041
But if we allowed that,

35
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:35,666
why divide the sectors
in the first place?

36
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:38,125
Do you mean those great
big walls you built?

37
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:39,833
Be a shame to let
them go to waste!

38
00:02:39,916 --> 00:02:42,500
Why didn't you just split the
planet into three instead?

39
00:02:42,583 --> 00:02:44,833
Potential residential planets
are a precious commodity.

40
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:46,375
[SAMSON]
Then, like he Empire,

41
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:48,500
you should put your prisoners
in space, in orbital cities.

42
00:02:48,583 --> 00:02:50,333
Life imprisonment in space?

43
00:02:50,416 --> 00:02:52,833
But that's cruel and inhumane!

44
00:02:52,916 --> 00:02:54,083
Heh!

45
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:56,333
No wonder we ended up
going to war with them.

46
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:57,708
They think about
things completely

47
00:02:57,791 --> 00:02:58,916
differently from the Abh!

48
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,541
Come on Samson,
you wouldn't want

49
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:02,541
to spend the rest of your
life stuck out in space

50
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:04,291
never to return, would you?

51
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:05,750
Of course I wouldn't!

52
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:08,291
If someone told me I'd never
put my feet on land again,

53
00:03:08,375 --> 00:03:10,166
I'd start plotting a
rebellion of my own!

54
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:11,000
[JINTO laughs]

55
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:12,708
Huh? Look over there!

56
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:15,208
That's the Eastern
Detention Sector.

57
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,500
[PILOT 16C]
About to reach our destination!

58
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:21,208
[FAZUN] Drop the food
supplies immediately!

59
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:22,541
[PILOT 16C]
Roger.

60
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:24,375
[PILOT 16B] Ship number two
beginning the drop!

61
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:25,958
[PILOT 16A] Ship number three
beginning the drop!

62
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:27,500
[PILOT 16D] Ship number four
beginning the drop!

63
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:29,500
[PILOT 16E] Ship number five
beginning the drop!

64
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:32,458
[PILOT 16F] Ship number six
beginning the drop!

65
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:34,541
[PRISONERS gasping]

66
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:42,291
Huh?

67
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:50,291
[PRISONERS chattering]

68
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:02,416
Don't you think
this is a bit extreme?

69
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,833
There's gotta be a safer way
of making the delivery.

70
00:04:04,916 --> 00:04:06,375
Please don't worry about it.

71
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:09,125
We precisely calculated the
effect the drop would have.

72
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:11,958
Ninety percent of the food
should withstand the impact.

73
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:14,375
The remaining 10%
should be salvageable

74
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:17,875
as long as they're careful
and take their time.

75
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:20,583
They might need to pick out a
bit of shrapnel here and there.

76
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:21,625
Ms. Fazun!

77
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:23,416
It looks like we're
under attack!

78
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,583
What's that?!
What did you just say?!

79
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:31,083
Our intentions may
have been misunderstood.

80
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:32,333
Is there any damage?

81
00:04:32,416 --> 00:04:33,750
[PILOT 16C] The paint's
chipped, but that's all.

82
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:35,750
At the moment, we're okay.

83
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:37,791
Good. All right,
here's what we'll do.

84
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:40,583
Immediately order the ships
to cease dropping the food.

85
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:43,208
[JINTO] Does that mean
we're going back to base?

86
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:44,500
[FAZUN]
Heh.

87
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:48,208
[JINTO] There's no need
for her to be like that!

88
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:30,541
[LAFIEL] I respect your opinions
and understand your concerns.

89
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:32,583
[DOKUFU] In that case,
why don't you go ahead

90
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:35,750
and recognize me as the
Territorial Representative?

91
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:37,625
Because I don't feel like it.

92
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:40,208
Remember that I represent
the overwhelming majority

93
00:06:40,291 --> 00:06:41,875
of the inhabitants of Lobnas!

94
00:06:41,958 --> 00:06:43,625
If you're refuse
to recognize me

95
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:45,541
as the Territorial
Representative--

96
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:47,833
Not "if"!
There's no "if" about it.

97
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:50,250
It's a plain fact that I
refuse to recognize you.

98
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:52,208
Yes, of course, I was, uh...

99
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:54,708
It was, you know,
just a figure of speech.

100
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:56,000
Very well.

101
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:58,041
Even though you've already
made your decision,

102
00:06:58,125 --> 00:07:00,708
could you at least give us
the reason for your refusal?

103
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:01,875
Definitely not!

104
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:03,916
That's not exactly
the answer I expected.

105
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,291
[LAFIEL]
That's no concern of mine.

106
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:07,416
I have nothing more
to say to you.

107
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,791
That's a pity.

108
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:12,958
But I'm not going to give up
on this, you underst--?

109
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:14,375
This is getting nowhere.

110
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:16,333
And it's all because you're not
acting as a go-between,

111
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:19,041
negotiating with them, Jinto.

112
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:22,625
[EKURYUA]
Captain!

113
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:23,833
There's a transmission request

114
00:07:23,916 --> 00:07:25,958
from the Western
Detention Sector.

115
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:28,375
And now from the Central
Detention Sector, as well.

116
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:29,916
[LAFIEL]
I've had enough of these fools.

117
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Tell them that we're
busy and can't answer.

118
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:33,750
Now there's another
request coming through.

119
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:35,166
How many times
do I have to tell--

120
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,166
It's the Deputy Ambassador!

121
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:39,208
[LAFIEL]
Gunfire?! From where?

122
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:41,875
[JINTO] I don't know...
Nothing to worry about.

123
00:07:41,958 --> 00:07:43,708
Probably just an accident.

124
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:46,500
Anyway, there's something far
more important to tell you.

125
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:47,500
[LAFIEL]
What's that?

126
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:48,750
[JINTO]
The workers and staff are

127
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:50,791
requesting our
assistance to emigrate.

128
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:51,875
[LAFIEL]
Is that all?

129
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:53,750
[JINTO]
But there's over 20,000 of them!

130
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:54,833
[LAFIEL]
So?

131
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:56,833
What do you mean?!
Did you hear me?!

132
00:07:56,916 --> 00:07:59,041
Twenty thousand!
How can you say that's fine?!

133
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:00,958
It's not that big a deal, is it?

134
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:03,125
You can put them on board
the transport ships.

135
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:04,500
on your way back here.

136
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:06,083
[JINTO] But where are we
gonna take them?

137
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:08,166
Shouldn't we decide that first?

138
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:10,833
[LAFIEL] What's wrong with
a prisoner-of-war camp?

139
00:08:12,541 --> 00:08:14,916
Did you say a
prisoner-of-war camp?

140
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,708
[LAFIEL]
Hm? What is it?

141
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:18,583
If the Administrative
Director leaves,

142
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:20,791
then will one of the
prisoners take control?

143
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,083
[LAFIEL]
It would appear that way.

144
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:23,916
I see...

145
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:28,125
I suppose you think that
means we're in for some

146
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:30,958
interesting times, don't you?

147
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:33,041
[MEIDEEN]
A prisoner-of-war camp?!

148
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:34,958
But we are not prisoners!

149
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:36,458
Just calm down
for a moment!

150
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:38,041
It's called a
prisoner-of-war camp,

151
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:40,208
but it's more like a
staging area now.

152
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:41,875
[MEIDEEN] What exactly
do you mean by that?

153
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:43,875
[JINTO] It's mainly used
to house any soldiers

154
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:45,416
whose ships have been destroyed.

155
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,833
It's more like a temporary
housing facility,

156
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:49,750
which we are willing
to let you use until you've

157
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:52,625
decided on your final
destination for emigration.

158
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:55,708
Uh-huh. And you can guarantee
that we will be free

159
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:57,708
to emigrate wherever we choose?

160
00:08:57,791 --> 00:09:00,041
[JINTO] Yes, so long as the
government of the planet

161
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:02,541
you wish to emigrate
to will accept you.

162
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,208
[MEIDEEN]
I see.

163
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:06,083
And will we be able to
receive information

164
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:07,625
to help us decide which planet?

165
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:09,083
Yes, of course.

166
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:10,625
[MEIDEEN] Then we'll decide
once we've looked at that.

167
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:13,208
We'll try to give you an
answer as soon as we can.

168
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:15,458
[JINTO]
We're not in a hurry.

169
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:18,333
Uh. There's something
we'd like you to do for us

170
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:19,916
before we help you leave.

171
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,250
We'd like you to choose

172
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:24,083
who the next territorial
representative should be.

173
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:27,833
[SOBAASH]
Captain, aren't you tired?

174
00:09:27,916 --> 00:09:29,666
No, not particularly.

175
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,791
Look, if anything happens,
I'll call you,

176
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:33,208
so go get some rest.

177
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:34,708
It won't make any
difference whether I'm

178
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:36,333
in my room or on the bridge.

179
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:38,958
As far as my body's concerned,
it's exactly the same.

180
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:42,083
If you say so,
but I'm not so sure...

181
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:44,250
Is it bothering you
that I'm sitting up here?

182
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:45,833
[SOBAASH]
No, not at all.

183
00:09:45,916 --> 00:09:48,958
It's just that I'm reminded of
something from some time ago.

184
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:50,583
Reminded of what?

185
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:53,125
Well, many years ago
I used to be involved

186
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:54,833
in the world of commerce.

187
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:56,750
I could have worked
on board some large ship

188
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:59,500
and been second navigator
in no time at all.

189
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:02,125
But I asked if I could borrow
some money from my father,

190
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:03,333
and on a whim,

191
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:05,666
I used that money to
rent a ship for a while.

192
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:08,333
Of course, it was
only a small one.

193
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:10,000
But I was so worried
about the ship

194
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:12,333
that I couldn't bring myself
to leave the bridge.

195
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:13,791
[LAFIEL]
Even when you slept?

196
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:15,833
Yes! The members of the crew

197
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:18,375
tried to warn me that I wasn't
doing myself any good,

198
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:21,666
but I stubbornly refused to
pay any attention to them.

199
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,041
When we reached our destination,

200
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:25,833
I had to engage in some
delicate negotiations,

201
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:27,666
but I couldn't
concentrate properly.

202
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,666
Because of that, we lost
quite a bit of profit.

203
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:33,125
[LAFIEL] I guess I do sleep
better in my room than up here.

204
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:34,541
[SOBAASH] You don't need
to learn your lesson

205
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:36,208
the hard way, like I did.

206
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:39,125
[LAFIEL] It's been five years
since I was first appointed,

207
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:42,125
and I've been fighting on the
battlefield for a year now.

208
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:43,666
[SOBAASH]
I know.

209
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:46,958
And that's why you should allow
yourself a bit more leeway.

210
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:48,708
I hope you're not
treating me like a child!

211
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:49,625
I don't appreciate it.

212
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:50,958
Absolutely not!

213
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:53,416
I'm just concerned about
you because you're young.

214
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,250
Concerned about what?

215
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:58,791
To be honest, I think you get
slightly over-enthusiastic.

216
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:00,916
Slightly over-enthusiastic?

217
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:01,875
You think so?

218
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:03,458
[SOBAASH]
That's how I see it.

219
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:05,458
I don't think I do
it intentionally.

220
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:07,541
Maybe it's because
when I have a job to do,

221
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,833
I want it to go right.
But to tell you the truth,

222
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:13,125
I never really wanted to be
a Territorial Ambassador.

223
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:16,000
[SOBAASH]
Here you go. It's cold.

224
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:19,583
[LAFIEL]
So how do you spend your time

225
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:21,625
when you're on your own?

226
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:24,333
If you don't mind my saying,
that's a personal question.

227
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:26,250
I'm sorry--
I didn't mean to pry.

228
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:27,791
Please forgive me.

229
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:29,750
That's okay. I really
don't mind you asking.

230
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:31,291
I've got nothing to hide!

231
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:32,791
Let's see...
What can I tell you...?

232
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:34,458
Well, I write a lot of letters.

233
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:35,708
Do you write every day?

234
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:37,708
[SOBAASH]
Yes, I do a few every day.

235
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:40,500
I pretty much write to everyone
I've ever met and known.

236
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:42,833
Plus, I still have some business
matters to attend to,

237
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:44,750
even though I'm out here
in the battlefield.

238
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:49,125
So I also have to spend a bit
of time doing office work.

239
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,250
[LAFIEL] Don't you get bored
of writing letters?

240
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:54,250
[SOBAASH] Not really. I love
reading all the replies I get.

241
00:11:54,333 --> 00:11:57,125
I only write letters to see
what comes back in the mail.

242
00:11:57,208 --> 00:12:00,208
It's a good way to keep
relationships from suffering.

243
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:02,000
[LAFIEL]
How can they suffer?

244
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:03,750
[SOBAASH] Even when you think
you're close to someone,

245
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:05,416
you need to spend time together,

246
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,375
otherwise it's easy for
the friendship to fade.

247
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:10,041
When you can't see
people in the flesh,

248
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:12,708
writing is a way of keeping
that connection alive.

249
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:14,083
You know, when I die,

250
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:17,333
I want my funeral to
be packed with friends!

251
00:12:17,416 --> 00:12:18,916
Even though I spend
most of my time

252
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
with all of you on board,

253
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:21,541
I don't think it's going
to be possible

254
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:23,291
for you and the rest of
the crew to be there.

255
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:24,833
You could be right.

256
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:27,666
If you die in battle, it'll be
when the ship is destroyed,

257
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,083
so we'll all go with you.

258
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:30,958
Come on, don't you think
you should really go

259
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,291
and get some rest now?

260
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:34,333
You know, it's been very
relaxing just sitting here

261
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:35,958
and chatting with you.
It's been nice.

262
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:38,541
I mustn't forget I'm still on
duty for the time being!

263
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:40,666
Yes, but just for
the time being, right?

264
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,916
Absolutely. Just for
the time being.

265
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,833
[beeping]

266
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:48,500
Supply Officer Lin
wants to get through.

267
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:50,666
[LAFIEL]
Put him on screen.

268
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:53,458
Territorial Ambassador,
this is the Deputy Ambassador

269
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:55,208
on the planet surface.

270
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:56,625
What's the matter?

271
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:58,833
We have updated plans regarding
the emigration issue.

272
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:00,083
We'll send you a copy.

273
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:02,041
Very good. By the way,

274
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:04,875
I could be wrong, but you
look a little tired to me.

275
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:06,708
A little? That's an
understatement!

276
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:08,875
Do you want me to come
down there as well?

277
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:10,750
Huh? No, it's okay.

278
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:13,416
It's probably better
if you stay up there.

279
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,708
Really...?

280
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:16,791
[JINTO] Now, the first
group to board consists

281
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:18,458
of 12,000 people.

282
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:20,958
We think the <i>Darkses</i> should
handle the transportation

283
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:22,791
between the ground and
the other transport

284
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:26,166
ships orbiting the planet.
It will take a couple of trips.

285
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:27,666
Is the <i>Darkses</i> ready?

286
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,625
[LAFIEL] Well, it's a ship
designed to transport supplies,

287
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:31,500
so it's not ideal
for passengers.

288
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:33,916
The squadron commander
says that it can only safely

289
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,416
accommodate up
to 8,000 people.

290
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:39,000
[JINTO] So do you think we
should arrange for more ships?

291
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:40,166
[LAFIEL]
Possibly.

292
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:41,708
Or more trips for the <i>Darkses</i> .

293
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:44,916
However, you can go ahead
and board the first 8,000.

294
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,708
I'll try and persuade them.

295
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:49,500
Do you have documents on the
habitability of the <i>Darkses</i> ?

296
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:51,083
No problem.

297
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:53,291
I'll get the transport squadron
to send them to you right away.

298
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:54,375
[JINTO]
That'd be great.

299
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:55,958
Oh, there's one more thing.

300
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:58,500
We received a list called the
Territorial Representative Order

301
00:13:58,583 --> 00:14:00,791
of Succession.
I'll get that to you.

302
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:03,500
Not only do they want us
to keep the contents secret,

303
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:05,500
but they also want us to
ensure that the prisoners

304
00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:07,583
aren't even aware
of its existence.

305
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:09,208
[LAFIEL]
So this list identifies

306
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:11,291
who should become the
territorial representative

307
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:13,666
after the current
administration is evacuated?

308
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,500
[JINTO]
No, unfortunately not.

309
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:17,583
It tells us who will be
in charge of the whole

310
00:14:17,666 --> 00:14:19,666
emigration process if
something should happen

311
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,541
to the current representative.

312
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:23,041
Once the prison
guards have left,

313
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:25,750
the list won't be
needed anymore.

314
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:28,375
[MEIDEEN] Only 8,000
people can get on board?!

315
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:30,541
Why didn't you say
so in the first place?!

316
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:32,833
We'll have to draw
up a new list now!

317
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:34,208
[JINTO]
If you're not in a hurry,

318
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:36,500
why don't you just wait for
a proper passenger ship

319
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:38,333
to arrive and leave on that?

320
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:40,708
Although, I would say that
it's more cost effective

321
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:42,208
for us in the Star Forces

322
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:45,333
if you would be willing to
use our transport ships.

323
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:48,875
[SHANGAL] You are obviously very
conscientious, your Highness.

324
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:50,416
Am I right, or not?

325
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,958
You could easily have tricked us
and crammed everyone inside

326
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:55,083
the hold to make the
evacuation cheaper,

327
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:57,958
but instead you insisted
on more ships.

328
00:14:58,041 --> 00:15:00,916
[JINTO] You are all human beings
and should be treated as such.

329
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,750
[SHANGAL] Anyway, these 8,000
people who are due to board--

330
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:06,041
if the administrative staff
decides they don't want

331
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:09,916
to travel on a transport ship,
we would love the opportunity.

332
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,666
We never said that
we didn't want to!

333
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:14,541
And since when exactly have
you wanted to emigrate?!

334
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:16,000
[SHANGAL]
Well, just because I haven't

335
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:17,791
had the chance to say it before,

336
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:20,291
does not mean that
it isn't true now!

337
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:22,458
I hereby declare that
all the inhabitants

338
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:26,791
of the Western Detention Sector
wish to leave Lobnas II!

339
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:28,583
[MEIDEEN] What makes you
think we would allow that?!

340
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:30,000
You're all criminals!

341
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:32,041
You are here because you need
to pay for your actions!

342
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:33,583
Don't you feel any remorse

343
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:35,041
towards the victims
of your crimes?

344
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:37,041
If we were the sort of
people who felt remorse,

345
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:39,708
do you think we would have been
put here in the first place?

346
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:42,291
On this godforsaken planet?

347
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:43,708
You can't let this happen!

348
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:45,916
You can't let the
criminals go free!

349
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,500
It's possible we won't have
any choice in the matter.

350
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:50,000
After all, none of
them were sentenced

351
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:51,708
under the laws of the Empire.

352
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:53,250
It's hard to say
what will happen.

353
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:55,375
As far as emigrating
to another planet

354
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:57,500
is concerned,
the decision rests entirely

355
00:15:57,583 --> 00:15:59,750
with the government of
the planet itself, not us.

356
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:01,750
However, if I can be
honest for a moment?

357
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:04,291
Please, carry on. Don't mind us!

358
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:06,083
[JINTO] I doubt if there would
be many governments

359
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:07,375
that would accept immigrants

360
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:09,291
whose past included
a criminal record.

361
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:11,083
[SHANGAL] Compared to
this dump of a planet,

362
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:12,666
anywhere else would be heaven.

363
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:14,041
I can guarantee these people

364
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:15,625
would commit crime
wherever they lived!

365
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,791
Surely the Empire
doesn't condone that?

366
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:19,750
Or does the Empire
not care about what happens

367
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:21,666
down here on
the ground worlds?

368
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,875
[JINTO] Sometimes,
I don't think they do.

369
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:24,916
From what I've heard,

370
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,583
those planets who do
accept criminals

371
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:29,125
as immigrants have much harsher
penalties for crime.

372
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:31,416
Harsher? How much harsher?

373
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,541
[JINTO]
Let's see now...

374
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:34,041
Well, for instance,

375
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:36,583
in a standard prisoner-of-war
camp, the highest penalty

376
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:38,458
for any crime is
the death sentence.

377
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:39,708
[SHANGAL, DOKUFU gasp]

378
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:41,916
What if I stole something
for a bit of fun?

379
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,666
Or when you have to kill someone
because they're so annoying?

380
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:47,916
The sentence for theft is
minimum of 10 years hard labor.

381
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,416
25 years for murder.

382
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:52,833
And parole for good
behavior is unheard of.

383
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:54,083
[SHANGAL, DOKUFU sigh]

384
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:55,791
You want to cancel your
plans for emigration?

385
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:56,916
No way!

386
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,666
Any where's gonna be
better than here.

387
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:01,208
We've just gotta stop
doing bad things, right?

388
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:03,666
This place will soon
be worse than hell.

389
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,500
[DOKUFU]
That is unforgivable.

390
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:07,375
You can dream about
leaving this place,

391
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:10,000
but for your information,
we're all staying!

392
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:13,125
We are going to build
an ideal society here!

393
00:17:13,208 --> 00:17:15,333
With Angus?!
You've gotta be kidding!

394
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:17,208
Good luck if you think
that's gonna work.

395
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:19,625
But we really need you
to stay here with us.

396
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:20,875
Oh, yeah? Why?

397
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:22,541
At least if we leave,
you'll probably become

398
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:25,708
the Territorial Representative.
Although, I can't see Angus

399
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:27,750
giving up his claim
without a bit of a fight.

400
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:30,208
But, with us out of the way, one
of your obstacles will be gone.

401
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:32,250
Without you this planet
has no hope.

402
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:34,375
We need you to
stay here with us.

403
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:36,208
You're the only ones
who can provide us

404
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:37,541
with future generations.

405
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:39,041
[SHANGAL]
You cannot be serious!

406
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:41,750
You want us women to stay
simply so we can provide you

407
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:43,708
and your cronies with children?!

408
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:45,833
We're not cattle for
breeding, you know!

409
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:47,250
Now do you understand?

410
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:50,208
Now do you see why we
have to get out of here?!

411
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:51,916
[DOKUFU]
I apologize if what I said

412
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,166
was phrased inappropriately.

413
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:57,125
Nevertheless, the fact remains
that if all the women leave,

414
00:17:57,208 --> 00:18:00,333
how will the planet survive
beyond our own generation?

415
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:01,375
[SHANGAL]
How should I know?!

416
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:04,416
This planet had
no future anyway!

417
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,375
I, uh...

418
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:06,666
[SHANGAL, DOKUFU, MEIDEEN]
Hm?

419
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,583
I'm sure we could
provide you with

420
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:11,208
some artificial
birth technology.

421
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:13,791
[SHANGAL, DOKUFU, MEIDEEN]
Huh?!

422
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:17,333
[JINTO] I guess they didn't
appreciate that idea...

423
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:20,083
Anyway, we want to
emigrate, understand?

424
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:22,000
Got that, Mr. Director?

425
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:25,750
You've made that clear.
However, we have our priorities.

426
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:28,916
First, the non-staff.
Then, all the staff.

427
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,583
And then, maybe you.

428
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:32,250
How dare you speak
like that to me!

429
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:33,583
I will not be brushed off!

430
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:35,750
You and your people made
a choice to live here!

431
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:38,458
We were brought here by
force against our will!

432
00:18:38,541 --> 00:18:40,166
[MEIDEEN]
That logic is ridiculous!

433
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:42,041
Don't ever forget that
you are the criminal,

434
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:43,333
not the victim here!

435
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:45,000
[SHANGAL]
This is going nowhere.

436
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:46,666
Mr. Ambassador...

437
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:49,125
Perhaps we could go and
discuss this privately?

438
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:51,000
Just the two of us...

439
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:53,250
If you insist, then I, uh...

440
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:55,083
However, I think
I should point out

441
00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:56,666
that in order for you
to board our ship

442
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,208
there are two things
you require.

443
00:18:58,291 --> 00:18:59,333
Like what?

444
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:01,083
Written permission
from each person

445
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:02,333
and from the government.

446
00:19:02,416 --> 00:19:03,750
That's quite correct.

447
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:05,833
Seeing as I am still
the representative

448
00:19:05,916 --> 00:19:07,750
for this territorial government,
you can't leave

449
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:09,000
unless I give you permission.

450
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:11,750
So it's no use trying
to seduce him!

451
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:13,250
[SHANGAL]
What are you insinuating?!

452
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:15,583
Are you suggesting what I
think you're suggesting?!

453
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:17,750
For all you know, the Count
might not even like girls!

454
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:19,958
He might be homosexual!

455
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:24,250
You're not homosexual, are you?

456
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:26,333
[JINTO] Do I really
have to answer this?

457
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:27,833
He doesn't have to answer that!

458
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:29,416
It has nothing to do with this!

459
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,125
It was just a little
joke of mine

460
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:33,083
to try to ease some of
the tension around here!

461
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:34,750
You weren't trying
to ease the tension!

462
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:37,041
You were trying to seduce
him into making a deal!

463
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:38,458
[SHANGAL]
Oh, so now you're accusing me

464
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:40,958
of using underhand methods
to get what I want, huh?

465
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:43,083
No wonder everybody who
lives on this island

466
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:44,583
hates and despises you!

467
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:46,458
Like I care?! It's not my job

468
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:48,333
to be Mr. Congeniality
for the prisoners!

469
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:50,166
Is abusing your authority
part of the job?!

470
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:51,791
When did I ever
abuse my authority?!

471
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:53,333
I won't tolerate
an insult like that!

472
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:55,375
Insult? You just wait, you
good-for-nothing, slimy--

473
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:57,125
Would you guys just cut it out?!

474
00:19:57,208 --> 00:19:58,291
[SAMSON laughs]

475
00:19:58,375 --> 00:20:00,250
[JINTO] Would you both
please calm down!

476
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:03,291
There's something I want
to make absolutely clear.

477
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:05,583
Even if I did make some
sort of deal with you,

478
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:07,166
it wouldn't make a difference!

479
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:09,958
We act according to the wishes
of the Territorial Government,

480
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:12,166
and nothing we say
is gonna change that.

481
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:14,791
As the Territorial Deputy
Ambassador, my powers

482
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:16,166
are strictly limited.

483
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:18,916
[laughs] This is too hilarious!

484
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,250
Maybe while you were at it

485
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:21,750
you should have asked
her Highness the Princess

486
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:25,333
if she was homosexual,
too! [laughs]

487
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:27,500
That remark was in bad taste.

488
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:29,416
Uh. Yes, I'm sorry.

489
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,666
I, uh, guess I got a little
carried away...

490
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,291
That was slanderous!

491
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:35,541
Isn't the ambassador
part of the royal family?

492
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:37,458
For questioning the
sexual preferences

493
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:38,833
of someone in that position,

494
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:41,375
you should be executed
for slander!

495
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:45,875
There are punishments
for blasphemy, right?

496
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:48,000
Well, I... think so...

497
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:50,916
There you are, Meideen!
You're finished!

498
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,958
However, the laws of the Empire
only apply to its own citizens.

499
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:56,625
You see, you can't
threaten me.

500
00:20:56,708 --> 00:20:58,208
Anyway, you're the one
who brought up the subject

501
00:20:58,291 --> 00:20:59,750
of being gay in the first place!

502
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:02,333
The Deputy Ambassador here
is part of the nobility, too!

503
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:05,750
Therefore, if I'm to be punished
for slander, so should you!

504
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:07,708
The Count here is
part of the nobility!

505
00:21:07,791 --> 00:21:10,250
Nobility and royalty
are different things!

506
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:12,666
Uh...

507
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:14,833
They are different, right?

508
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:16,916
Yes, they're different
from each other.

509
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,458
Now I think we should
all calm down

510
00:21:18,541 --> 00:21:20,250
and get back to the
original discussion.

511
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:22,041
How can I possibly calm down?!

512
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:24,500
Once the Administrative
Director leaves the planet,

513
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:26,791
we'll going to have to grovel
to get permission to emigrate

514
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:29,166
from Dokufu here
or that fool Angus!

515
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:30,916
Do you really think
they'd let us go?!

516
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:31,750
Uh.

517
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:33,333
How disappointing!

518
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:36,500
I wish you could believe that as
the Territorial Representative,

519
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:38,541
I'm not going to impinge
on people's freedom.

520
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:40,208
Any time you want to emigrate,

521
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:42,083
you just say the word
and you can go.

522
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:44,250
Like I'm gonna take
the word of a con artist.

523
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:46,583
Forget it! I'm not that stupid.

524
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:49,208
I hadn't realized
the true situation.

525
00:21:49,291 --> 00:21:50,541
Very well then,

526
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:52,833
my plan is to leave on
the last ship out of here.

527
00:21:52,916 --> 00:21:55,291
But before I go, I shall give
you permission to emigrate.

528
00:21:55,375 --> 00:21:57,041
Really?! Are you sure?!

529
00:21:57,125 --> 00:21:59,250
You are a wonderful
Administrative Director!

530
00:21:59,333 --> 00:22:00,791
I knew you'd understand!

531
00:22:00,875 --> 00:22:03,000
Deputy Ambassador,
it appears that we are

532
00:22:03,083 --> 00:22:04,625
going to have to
adjust our plans.

533
00:22:04,708 --> 00:22:06,291
There'll be more people?

534
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:07,583
[SHANGAL]
It won't be a problem!

535
00:22:07,666 --> 00:22:08,916
The Western Detention Sector

536
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,500
has the smallest
population of them all.

537
00:22:11,583 --> 00:22:13,166
Approximately how many?

538
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:17,583
Now, let's see... About 100,000.

539
00:22:17,666 --> 00:22:19,416
[BOORUKAU CREW 1]
Current position 700 kedrel

540
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,958
from Ryureem Gate 13.

541
00:22:21,041 --> 00:22:22,291
[VICE-COMMANDER]
Commence reconnaissance action

542
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:23,583
as initially planned.

543
00:22:23,666 --> 00:22:24,583
[BOORUKAU CREW 2]
All ships prepare to launch

544
00:22:24,666 --> 00:22:26,833
high-speed
communication bubbles.

545
00:22:27,916 --> 00:22:29,000
[VICE-COMMANDER]
Hold on!

546
00:22:29,083 --> 00:22:32,416
Don't send the
communication bubbles yet.

547
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,125
Commander, I think you
should look at this.

548
00:22:34,208 --> 00:22:36,208
You see the radar screen?

549
00:22:36,291 --> 00:22:37,833
What is it? [gasps]

550
00:22:37,916 --> 00:22:39,166
[CREW 1]
Currently confirming the numbers

551
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:41,583
of space-time bubbles.
Initial estimation is that

552
00:22:41,666 --> 00:22:43,958
we're looking in the
region of over 20,000.

553
00:22:44,041 --> 00:22:46,208
[BOORUKAU CREW 2] We can now
determine the size of the enemy.

554
00:22:46,291 --> 00:22:48,250
Forty squadrons... and
they seem to be heading

555
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:50,541
towards the center of
the Milky Way Gates.

556
00:22:50,625 --> 00:22:53,166
Launch the communication
bubbles immediately!

557
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:54,875
The main fleet needs
to know about this!

558
00:22:54,958 --> 00:22:56,958
[COMM CHIEF]
Yes, sir!

559
00:22:57,041 --> 00:23:00,583
[JINTO]
So... The time has come...

560
00:24:47,208 --> 00:24:48,500
[NEFEE]
We've spotted an enemy fleet

561
00:24:48,583 --> 00:24:50,208
passing through Ryureem
Gate Thirteen.

562
00:24:50,291 --> 00:24:52,833
There appear to be 40 squadrons.

563
00:24:52,916 --> 00:24:55,291
[TRIFE] It's possible we may
not get the information in time

564
00:24:55,375 --> 00:24:58,333
before we have to fight.
We have no idea what may happen.

565
00:24:58,416 --> 00:24:59,625
[LAFIEL]
Yes, I suppose

566
00:24:59,708 --> 00:25:01,333
we're going to have to
be ready for anything.

567
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:03,958
[SOBAASH] It's been two months
since we arrived in this system.

568
00:25:04,041 --> 00:25:05,875
[MEIDEEN] Is that
His Excellency, the Count?

569
00:25:05,958 --> 00:25:06,791
[JINTO]
Yes.

570
00:25:06,875 --> 00:25:07,833
[MEIDEEN]
It's a rebellion!

571
00:25:07,916 --> 00:25:09,458
We need your
assistance immediately!

572
00:25:09,541 --> 00:25:11,458
[JINTO]
This is how it should be.
