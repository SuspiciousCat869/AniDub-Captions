1
00:00:17,708 --> 00:00:21,208
[LAFIEL] I am an Abriel.
And Abriels don't cry.

2
00:00:21,291 --> 00:00:24,250
I wish I wasn't an
Abriel right now!

3
00:00:27,375 --> 00:00:30,916
[SAMSON] I'm sorry, Captain.
I should've gone with him.

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,291
[LAFIEL]
It's not your fault.

5
00:00:32,375 --> 00:00:35,000
He was the one who
made the decision.

6
00:00:35,083 --> 00:00:35,916
[SAMSON]
Yes, but...

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,250
[LAFIEL]
It's all right.

8
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:39,250
It wass his own fault
that he was captured,

9
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:41,875
and it's my fault that I'm
leaving him down there.

10
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:43,875
You intend to abandon him?!

11
00:00:43,958 --> 00:00:45,458
Come back to the ship.

12
00:00:45,541 --> 00:00:46,708
[SAMSON]
Captain, please.

13
00:00:46,791 --> 00:00:49,166
Allow me to fulfill my
responsibilities to him.

14
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:52,333
Tell you what. I won't take
my men. I'll go on my own.

15
00:00:52,416 --> 00:00:54,541
My guess is that they really
want to avoid getting

16
00:00:54,625 --> 00:00:55,916
into a fight with us.

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,166
All we need to do is provide
them with an opportunity

18
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:00,666
to give him back. They've failed
and they know it.

19
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,625
But the thing about people
who've failed is they don't

20
00:01:02,708 --> 00:01:03,875
like to admit it.

21
00:01:03,958 --> 00:01:05,875
That's honestly how it
is down there, Captain.

22
00:01:05,958 --> 00:01:08,208
My going there will give them
a chance to return the boy

23
00:01:08,291 --> 00:01:10,416
without losing face
over their failure.

24
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,041
It's a gamble, but please
give me this one chance!

25
00:01:13,125 --> 00:01:16,166
Be silent! I don't want
to hear any more talk

26
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:18,083
from you about rescuing him.

27
00:01:18,166 --> 00:01:20,750
You're not
responsible here, I am!

28
00:01:20,833 --> 00:01:25,583
Please be quiet,
Samson Bolge Tilsal Tiluse!

29

--[LAFIEL sighs]
--[beeping]

31
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:29,708
Excuse me, Captain.
There's a transmission

32
00:01:29,791 --> 00:01:32,041
coming through from Commander
Gabort on board the <i>Melkutel</i> .

33
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:33,375
Your highness,

34
00:01:33,458 --> 00:01:36,250
I think we understand what
needs to be done here.

35
00:01:36,333 --> 00:01:38,291
We can assemble a
maximum of 50 men

36
00:01:38,375 --> 00:01:40,625
to be used as
ground battle forces.

37
00:01:40,708 --> 00:01:43,375
We believe the best strategy
is to land our transport ships

38
00:01:43,458 --> 00:01:45,916
as near as possible to the
location where His Excellency

39
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,166
is being held and then forcibly
storm the compound.

40
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:50,666
And what are our chances?

41
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:52,958
At best, the prediction is
between an eight and a

42
00:01:53,041 --> 00:01:55,333
twenty-one per cent
chance of success.

43
00:01:55,416 --> 00:01:58,125
What will happen to the ground
troops if they don't succeed?

44
00:01:58,208 --> 00:01:59,958
[GABORT] It's be unlikely that
any of them would return.

45
00:02:00,041 --> 00:02:01,791
[LAFIEL sighs]

46
00:02:08,416 --> 00:02:11,083
I want you to ensure the
emigration goes smoothly.

47
00:02:11,166 --> 00:02:12,333
[GABORT]
Is that an order?

48
00:02:12,416 --> 00:02:13,333
[LAFIEL]
Yes.

49
00:02:13,416 --> 00:02:15,833
[GABORT]
Understood.

50
00:02:15,916 --> 00:02:19,166
Who's the next
Territorial Representative?

51
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:21,791
[SOBAASH] Um... it's a
man called Tomasof.

52
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:23,291
Contact him immediately.

53
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:26,541
We can inaugurate
him informally. No delay.

54
00:02:26,625 --> 00:02:28,416
Otherwise, I'll forget
about him.

55
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,291
Would you, Your Highness?

56
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:31,458
[gasps]

57
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:12,833
[DOKUFU] What do you
think you're doing?

58
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:14,750
I don't want to experience
the hell these Abh

59
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:18,416
are talking about! Besides, you
don't even take Alkaik, do you?

60
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,208
[ANGUS] It's against
the teachings of God.

61
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:21,541
So what's your point?

62
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:23,625
[DOKUFU] So why do you
have to stay here at all?

63
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:26,416
Now obviously these guys aren't
going to let you emigrate,

64
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,166
but there'll be other
opportunities for you to leave

65
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,666
once they're out of the way.

66
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:32,083
Then you can father so many
children that you won't even

67
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:34,166
be able to remember
all their names!

68
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,125
[ANGUS] You know,
I never thought of that.

69
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:37,666
[DOKUFU]
Give me a break!

70
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:40,166
The only reason guys like us
have got to stick around this

71
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,375
dump of a planet is
because we need to get our

72
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:44,916
next fix of Alkaik!

73
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,500
I am an Abriel.
And Abriels don't cry.

74
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:50,833
I wish I wasn't an
Abriel right now!

75
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:52,416
[DOKUFU]
So it's decided.

76
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,291
When I officially become Prime
Minister of the Lobnas System,

77
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:58,250
the first thing I'll do is sign
your emigration papers.

78
00:04:58,333 --> 00:05:00,625
So stop being obstructive and
let's give the young Count

79
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:02,125
here his freedom!

80
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:03,500
[ANGUS]
No, I can't do it.

81
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:05,125
I issued a challenge
and I am determined

82
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:07,166
not to go back on my word.

83
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:10,083
Besides, there's no planet
that would have me.

84
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:11,875
Even if I did emigrate.

85
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:13,083
[DOKUFU]
But what's the point?

86
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:14,875
We have nothing to gain by this!

87
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:16,333
You heard what they said!

88
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:19,208
The Abh have no intention of
leaving any women behind.

89
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:22,000
Do you think things will be any
different if we kill the Count?

90
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:25,291
Besides, this isn't exactly
proving to be much fun.

91
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,750
So why don't we
call it quits, huh?

92
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:31,125
I'll tell them we've
changed our minds, okay?

93
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:32,041
No way!

94
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:33,958
Why not?! Huh?!

95
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:36,083
You might like the idea
of spending some time

96
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:39,458
in a man-made hell before going
to the real one, but I don't!

97
00:05:39,541 --> 00:05:40,916
Got it?!

98
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,833
I may not believe in a hell
supposedly created by God,

99
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:47,125
but a hell created by the Abh is
a different matter altogether!

100
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:49,791
And I have no doubts
they could do that!

101
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:51,333
[ANGUS]
No!

102
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:54,333
Oh come on! Whatever you say,
I'm putting an end to this!

103
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:57,000
We're gonna gain nothing
by fighting against them!

104
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:58,875
I'm not going to give in!

105
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:01,958
Using force is our only option
in situations like these.

106
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:04,041
We have to work together if
we want to stop the women

107
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:06,291
from being taken away from us.

108
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:08,416
I have no intention
of doing that!

109
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,083
[DOKUFU] If you want to carry
on with this by yourself,

110
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:13,583
that's fine with me! Just watch
your back with these guys!

111
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:15,958
Well now we have a reason
for holding him captive

112
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:18,125
as our hostage, don't we?

113
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:20,541
[grunts]

114
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:23,041
[ANGUS] If you do anything
to jeopardize this fight,

115
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:26,333
then I'll kill the boy. And I'll
make sure to tell people

116
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:27,833
that you were the
one who did it.

117
00:06:27,916 --> 00:06:30,833
Then you'll be the one visiting
the fake Abh hell, Dokufu.

118
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:32,416
You won't get away
with making these

119
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,333
false accusations against me.

120
00:06:34,416 --> 00:06:36,750
There are plenty of witnesses
I could find to tell the truth

121
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:38,625
about what really happened here!

122
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:41,541
The only one of us who's going
to experience hell is you.

123
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:43,208
If it exists.

124
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,833
[ANGUS] If I'm going to hell,
you'll only be one step behind.

125
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:53,916
It'll be such fun to see if
the Abh pay any attention

126
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,583
to your cries of mercy.

127
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:56,833
This isn't fair!

128
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,458
[ANGUS] I thought you
weren't afraid of dying,

129
00:06:58,541 --> 00:07:00,333
so what's your
problem with this?

130
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:05,000
You're the coward...
around here, Angus.

131
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:07,625
If you had any courage,
you would stay and face

132
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:10,625
the repercussions for your
crimes instead of running away.

133
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:12,916
Very impressive
speech for a coward.

134
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,208
But it's a mistake to talk
to Lord Angus like that.

And why?

00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:21,208
Because if there's one thing
I hate more than cowardice,

138
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:24,750
it's impudence! Do you
understand me?!

Distance to the enemy fleet:
approximately 2100 kedrel.

155
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:20,500
The enemy is currently heading
towards us, but we have an

156
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:23,291
estimated 24 hours
until they arrive.

157
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:27,375
A further 11 ships are due to
join our squadron before then.

158
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:29,458
You don't need me
to tell you this,

159
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:33,375
but even if the enemy starts to
attack us, we mustn't retaliate.

160
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:34,958
[KUFADIS]
Of course, Commander.

161
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:37,625
Once again our task is to
simply monitor the movements

162
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:40,083
of the enemy and
gather information.

163
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:42,125
Then just as we get in
a position to attack,

164
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:44,416
we have to run away
like frightened rabbits.

165
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:48,166
Uh, sorry, our squadron's duty
is to promptly retreat.

166
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:50,166
I suppose we could
enjoy ourselves

167
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,208
teasing these slack-jawed
mud-turtles!

168
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:53,750
[KUFADIS]
That's a relief!

169
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,625
At least she's
enjoying the mission.

170
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:58,000
As long as we can keep her
Highness in a good mood,

171
00:08:58,083 --> 00:09:00,375
we shouldn't have any problems!

172
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:02,291
We've picked up a fleet!

173
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,541
[KUFADIS]
Huh?

174
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:04,625
[COMM. OFFICER]
Looks like it could be allies.

175
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:06,083
Two Kutel class ships,

176
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:08,750
one Ses class ship and
one Roil class ship.

177
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:10,916
What do they think
they're doing here?

178
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,958
They've already received
the order to withdraw.

179
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:14,958
Who's responsible for them?

180
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:16,750
[KUFADIS] Since the fleet
seems to primarily consist

181
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:18,000
of transport ships,

182
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:20,375
I would guess it's the
Territorial Ambassador.

183
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:22,750
And who would that be,
my dear Chief of Staff?

184
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:25,458
Let's see...
The Ambassador is...

185
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:29,708
Oh... It's the
Viscountess Paryunu!

186
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:33,541
That Princess must have
crossed my path ten times now.

187
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:35,791
One of the times we came
across her, she was somewhere

188
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:37,666
she shouldn't have been.
Looks like she's gone

189
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:40,416
and done it again.
Not a one-off after all.

190
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,250
Well, Maybe it's
destiny or something.

191
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:44,708
Don't be stupid.

192
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:47,250
I want you to get me the
Territorial Ambassador.

193
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:51,666
Deca-Commander Abriel.

194
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:54,083
What are you doing in
this planetary system?

195
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:56,625
I thought you were
supposed to withdraw!

196
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:58,708
The enemy fleet is
headed this way.

197
00:09:58,791 --> 00:10:00,541
You must evacuate immediately!

198
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:02,291
No, not yet, Grand Duchess.

199
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:03,958
Not yet?

200
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:05,875
Please explain.

201
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,750
[SPOOR] So let me see
if I've got this right,

202
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:17,333
Deca-Commander Abriel.

203
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:20,125
This planet is populated by a
bunch of convicted criminals

204
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:22,708
who have requested that
you help them to emigrate?

205
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:25,708
And insist it has to be done
before you withdraw?

206
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:29,458
And being such a kind,
caring person,

207
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:31,000
you accepted their wishes?

208
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:33,041
There are guards as
well as prisoners.

209
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:35,375
Even so, the only people
involved are those

210
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:36,791
living on the ground world.

211
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:39,750
Be careful that you
don't get too attached,

212
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:41,291
Deca-Commander Abriel.

213
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:42,750
Yes, Ma'am, I know.

214
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:44,958
But I've made a promise
that I intend to keep.

215
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:48,541
Yes, I see.
Promises are important.

216
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:50,625
But from what you've told me,
there's no way you can

217
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:53,416
evacuate all the emigrants
before the enemy arrives.

218
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,208
What are you gonna about that?

219
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:57,958
I would like to request military
protection until we've finished

220
00:10:58,041 --> 00:10:59,125
boarding them all.

221
00:11:02,541 --> 00:11:06,125
[KUFADIS] Who does she think
is going to give her that?!

222
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:07,416
Surely not us?!

223
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,791
How could you be so foolish
as to ask me that?

224
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:13,750
I can't run the risk of damaging
any of my precious little ships!

225
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:15,208
[LAFIEL] But if you
don't help us out here,

226
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:17,916
many of these people might
end up dead, Grand Duchess!

227
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,583
[SPOOR]
I don't think so.

228
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:22,583
You forget the fact
that until recently,

229
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:25,916
this system was under the
command of the United Mankind.

230
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,625
The enemy ships heading
in this direction are allies

231
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:30,458
of the United Mankind.

232
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:31,958
And another thing.

233
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:34,500
If our forces get into a
battle trying to protect you,

234
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:37,458
it's possible I may
lose some of my men.

235
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:40,000
Do you really think it's worth
risking the lives of my men

236
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:41,541
to protect these people?

237
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:43,750
Especially considering the fact
that they are all convicted

238
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:46,291
criminals who should be
serving their sentences?

239
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:50,250
Hey, it's not easy for
me to say this to you

240
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:52,333
So let me put it bluntly.

241
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:54,666
If we fight, we lose.

242
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,875
The difference between us
in terms of fighting power

243
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:59,625
means that we are
likely to be annihilated.

244
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:02,708
We'd need a miracle to survive,
let alone win.

245
00:12:02,791 --> 00:12:04,541
Can you provide
us with a miracle?

246
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:06,250
Well, can you?

247
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:09,291
No. But I'm not asking
you to win the battle.

248
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:10,791
We just need more time.

249
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:14,208
[SPOOR chuckles]
That's terrible!

250
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:16,625
You're not seriously asking
me to send my troops

251
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:18,583
into such a futile battle?!

252
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:20,833
I cannot issue you with
an order, as you're not under

253
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:24,208
my jurisdiction, so I will
simply offer you a warning.

254
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:26,333
Leave this system immediately!

255
00:12:26,416 --> 00:12:29,125
[LAFIEL] I can't do it.
These people need us.

256
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:31,625
They are afraid to be
left behind, Commander.

257
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:34,875
[SPOOR] Although I don't like
admitting it, I too am afraid.

258
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:38,000
Afraid that I, the Grand
Duchess Spoor Alon Sekpat

259
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:40,833
Letopanyu Beneej, will be seen
as someone who leads her

260
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:42,875
troops to be massacred
in a worthless battle.

261
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:45,541
I couldn't face the
shame and the dishonor.

262
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:47,041
[LAFIEL]
It's not worthless!

263
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:49,083
I hope you're not saying
that keeping a promise

264
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:52,041
makes risking the lives
of my men worthwhile?

265
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:54,541
This isn't just about
my promise any more.

266
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:56,208
Then what is it about?

267
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:57,958
[LAFIEL]
The honor of the Empire.

268
00:12:58,041 --> 00:13:00,583
As the Territorial Ambassador,
I ask you to protect

269
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:03,541
the Lobnas System until
boarding is complete!

270
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:06,583
What a stubborn
little bitch you are.

271
00:13:06,666 --> 00:13:10,041
[KUFADIS] I hope no one
heard her Highness say that.

272
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:12,541
Not exactly the most
sophisticated response.

273
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,666
[SPOOR]
One thing makes me curious.

274
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:17,458
What if we hadn't been around
for you to request assistance?

275
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:19,541
What would you have done then?

276
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:21,916
[LAFIEL] The only reason you're
here is because you're tracking

277
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,833
the enemy fleet. If you
weren't here, the enemy wouldn't

278
00:13:24,916 --> 00:13:28,000
be either, and we wouldn't
need to ask for your help.

279
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:29,666
That's a very good point.

280
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:32,083
However, have you planned
what you would do if I decide

281
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:33,375
to refuse your request?

282
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:35,333
We would have to
hide on the planet.

283
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:37,958
[SPOOR]
Hide down there? How?

284
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:40,000
[LAFIEL] The assault vessel and
the main transport ship

285
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:42,416
will leave the system with you,
Because they don't have the

286
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,708
capability to
land on the planet.

287
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:46,750
The other transport ship
will land on the ocean

288
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:48,250
and hide beneath the sea.

289
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:50,750
Then we can start boarding
as many emigrants as possible,

290
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:52,000
including ourselves.

291
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:54,125
[SPOOR] Hmph! That's a
bit of a gamble.

292
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:56,083
You're assuming the enemy
won't check out what's down

293
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:58,833
on the ground once they arrive.
If they were to attack,

294
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:02,375
a Ses class ship like that
would be easily destroyed.

295
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:04,666
If they do attack, then we're
going to need more than luck

296
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:05,833
to help us.

297
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:07,708
Well, you're right about that.

298
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:12,333
This is an extremely unfortunate
position to be in. Hm...

299
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,208
[SPOOR] All right,
Territorial Ambassador.

300
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:18,083
I agree to help
with your request.

301
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:20,166
Now wait a minute,
Commander in Chief!

302
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,500
Don't you realize what
you're getting into here?

303
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:23,750
This is dangerous!

304
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:25,833
[SPOOR] However, I will
offer no grand gestures

305
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:28,291
guaranteeing success in
this effort to protect you

306
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:30,125
and this planetary system.

307
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:31,541
Be aware that I
have no intention

308
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:34,208
of allowing my forces to be
destroyed unnecessarily.

309
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:36,083
Therefore, we will
retreat from the battle

310
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:37,666
when and if we see fit.

311
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:40,583
We will offer our assistance
to you only for a short time.

312
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:42,666
Have I made myself clear,
Ambassador?

313
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:46,125
That's fine, Grand Duchess.
We'll only need a short time.

314
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:48,083
Would you also be willing
to put my assault vessel

315
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:50,250
under your command
during this operation?

316
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:52,500
I will have to
refuse that request.

317
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:54,458
It would be an inconvenience.

318
00:14:54,541 --> 00:14:56,833
Right now, you should be
concentrating all your efforts

319
00:14:56,916 --> 00:14:58,458
on this mission so
it can be completed

320
00:14:58,541 --> 00:14:59,875
as quickly as possible.

321
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:02,708
Understood. We'll be
counting on you.

322
00:15:02,791 --> 00:15:05,916
Why did you agree to help them
with such a reckless operation?!

323
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,708
[SPOOR]
Have you forgotten who I am?

324
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:11,750
I am the
Grand Duchess, Letopanyu.

325
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:15,083
I know the Princess only holds
the rank of an Ambassador,

326
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:17,750
but how can I refuse a
request from a fellow member

327
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,500
of the aristocracy?

328
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:21,958
But you are the Commander
in Chief of Operation Hunter's

329
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:24,666
First Fleet and you should
behave accordingly!

330
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:27,416
What do you mean?
Am I not behaving?

331
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,583
Part of our role as members
of the Star Forces

332
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:31,666
is to protect the
honor of the Empire!

333
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,625
I know, but surely
there's a limit?

334
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:36,291
Should we be placing our fleet
in danger simply to soothe

335
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:39,375
the persecution complexes of
ground world inhabitants?!

336
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:42,583
Well, I may not know much
about persecution complexes,

337
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:45,333
but I think I finally understand
why they want to get me involved

338
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:49,333
in all this. It's a rahter
effective method of harassment.

339
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:52,375
You think she wanted your
help just to harass you?

340
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:55,000
I'm not sure that's
what she meant.

341
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:57,500
Oh yes it was.
Just what you'd expect.

342
00:15:57,583 --> 00:16:00,375
The Abriels worked out what
sort of situations we Spoors

343
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:02,833
find annoying to deal with and
then they forced me into it

344
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:04,666
for their own amusement!

345
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,208
Oh...

346
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:07,708
[KUFADIS]  Those inhabitants
down there aren't the only ones

347
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:10,083
suffering from a
persecution complex.

348
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:12,041
[KUFADIS] The information
uplink from the <i>Basroil</i>

349
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:13,750
has been completed!

350
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:17,041
[gasps]
Commander in Chief!

351
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:19,375
The Territorial Deputy
Ambassador has been kidnapped

352
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:21,375
by rebels from the ground world!

353
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:24,291
And who is the Territorial
Deputy Ambassador?

354
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:26,208
[KUFADIS] It's his Excellency,
Count Hyde.

355
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:29,041
Oh! That's not good.

356
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:30,625
[KUFADIS] I wonder why her
Highness didn't mention

357
00:16:30,708 --> 00:16:32,208
anything about it?

358
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:34,291
[SPOOR] She probably didn't
think it was important enough

359
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:37,750
for us to know. At least
in her estimation.

360
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,291
Will he come back?

361
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:45,125
Yes, he's gonna be just fine.

362
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:47,000
[KUFADIS] We could arrange
to send down a significant

363
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:48,750
ground battle force
from our fleet.

364
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:51,583
We could try and
help them rescue him.

365
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:54,041
[SPOOR]
And minimize our forces up here?

366
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:55,916
They're small enough
to begin with!

367
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,458
I don't want any of my men
participating in a ground battle

368
00:16:58,541 --> 00:17:00,708
when they're not used to it.

369
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:03,166
[KUFADIS]
I suppose so. It'd be difficult,

370
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:06,041
especially if we have to
find them accommodations.

371
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:09,208
Of course, Count Hyde
is Abh nobility.

372
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:11,333
It's a shame, but I
guess all we can do

373
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:13,125
is keep our fingers
crossed for him.

374
00:17:13,208 --> 00:17:15,000
Yes it is a bit of a shame.

375
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:18,208
I only met him once,
but I liked the boy.

376
00:17:18,291 --> 00:17:20,833
You know, he made his little
Abriel friend wear such a

377
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:23,958
ridiculous disguise!

378
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:26,708
Her Highness was
sobbing her heart out!

379
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:29,583
[KUFADIS]
Sobbing?

380
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:32,500
[SPOOR] Abriels don't
normally cry. Do you know why?

381
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:33,875
[KUFADIS]
No.

382
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:35,541
[SPOOR]
An Emperor must be fair.

383
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:37,333
And more importantly,
they must be seen

384
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:39,250
to be fair to their subjects.

385
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:42,125
If they were to find themselves
crying over one subject,

386
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:43,791
they would have
to cry over them all

387
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:45,791
so as not to show
any favoritism.

388
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:47,333
Which is impossible.

389
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:50,625
How can you possibly shed tears
for someone you don't know?

390
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:54,041
Therefore, Abriels like the
princess, who are in line

391
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:57,791
for the throne of Emperor
learn to cry for no one.

392
00:17:57,875 --> 00:17:59,791
[KUFADIS]
I see.

393
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:02,208
The Emperor has the power
to send us to our deaths

394
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:03,750
at the click of a finger.

395
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:06,208
With that sort of authority,
you can understand how people

396
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:09,291
might get annoyed if there's
any sign of favoritism.

397
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:14,166
[SPOOR] Of course. But we
Spoors can see through it all.

398
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:17,041
I've seen Abriels crying.

399
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:21,166
I clearly remember seeing her
Highness blubbering like a baby.

400
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:22,583
[KUFADIS] She didn't look
like the sort of person

401
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:23,916
who'd do that when I saw her.

402
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,916
Now don't worry about it,
my dear Chief of Staff.

403
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,625
There's nothing wrong with it.

404
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:31,333
But if you've never had the
satisfaction of seeing the tears

405
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:33,958
of a young Abriel, you cannot
inherit the title of

406
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:36,291
Grand Duchess of Letopanyu!

407
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:37,750
Commander...

408
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:39,958
I hope you're not putting
the lives of our men at risk

409
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:42,916
simply because you're feeling
sorry for the Ambassador?

410
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Who, me?

411
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:45,666
Feel sorry for an Abriel?!

412
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,041
Whatever gave you that idea?

413
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:48,125
Huh?

414
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:49,916
[SPOOR]
If I hear any of that nonsense

415
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,708
coming out of your mouth again,
I'll see that your tongue is

416
00:18:52,791 --> 00:18:55,375
cut out, chopped into a
thousand tiny little pieces,

417
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:57,375
and fed to my precious birdies.

Another ship has now arrived!

to have to do as he says!

really going to save us?

The <i>Boreses</i> should go straight

to the furthest

also head for the camp,

now that it's in orbit.

450

00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:46,125
the people were using rafts
which barely stayed afloat.

460
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:50,208
But their initiative in using
those rafts means that we

461
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:52,458
should be able to get them
on board more quickly.

462
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:54,875
This operation might
very well succeed!

463
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:57,208
I'd like to speak with the
Territorial Representative.

464
00:20:57,291 --> 00:21:00,125
Yes. I'll get him for you.

465
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:02,041
[LAFIEL] This is the
Territorial Ambassador.

466
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:03,500
How are things going down there?

467
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:05,875
The situation has calmed
down compared to earlier,

468
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:08,166
but there are still small
skirmishes here and there.

469
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:10,541
There are also unconfirmed
reports coming in that the

470
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:13,208
prisoners have started fighting
against each other now.

471
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:15,750
But the women have all been
evacuated from the island.

472
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:18,291
If you tell them that,
won't they stop?

473
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:20,375
You should return
the harbor.

474
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:21,791
That's a good idea.

475
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:23,916
Frankly, I don't think anything
we say to them will have

476
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,291
much effect on the fighting,
but we'll do as you say.

477
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:29,666
And uh... have you heard
any news about the

478
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:32,500
Territorial Deputy Ambassador?

479
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,041
Unfortunately not.

480
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:36,958
If we do hear anything,
we'll let you know immediately.

481
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:39,000
Thanks.

482
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:41,458
[LAFIEL] I shouldn't
have asked about that.

483
00:21:42,666 --> 00:21:44,500
[TOMASOF]
And I... uh...

484
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:45,666
Yes, what is it?

485
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:48,125
If anything does happen
to his Excellency,

486
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:49,791
the Deputy Ambassador,

487
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:52,916
will we be liable for any
sort of punishment from you?

488
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,708
No of course not. None of this
was your responsibility.

489
00:21:56,791 --> 00:22:00,000
Thank you. We'll be
in contact later.

490
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:02,375
You're not thinking of doing
anything out of the ordinary?

491
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:03,583
Your Highness?

492
00:22:03,666 --> 00:22:05,041
What do you mean?

493
00:22:05,125 --> 00:22:07,208
I hope your Highness isn't
intending to leave the ship

494
00:22:07,291 --> 00:22:09,125
for any reason,
because I'll stop you,

495
00:22:09,208 --> 00:22:11,625
even if I have to
resort to using force.

496
00:22:11,708 --> 00:22:15,375
It's okay, don't worry. I'm not
going to do anything stupid.

497
00:22:15,458 --> 00:22:17,208
Besides, we don't even
know where they're keeping

498
00:22:17,291 --> 00:22:20,125
him hostage.

499
00:22:20,208 --> 00:22:21,541
[GABORT]
That's a relief.

500
00:22:26,708 --> 00:22:29,291
Would you? Your Highness?

501
00:22:29,375 --> 00:22:31,333
[LAFIEL] That's the first
time she's ever called me

502
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:33,250
"Your Highness".

503
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:34,625
[JINTO]
Bye...

504
00:22:38,916 --> 00:22:40,291
[LAFIEL]
Jinto...

505
00:22:42,458 --> 00:22:44,166
[LAFIEL]
Are you still alive?

506
00:22:48,583 --> 00:22:49,875
[LAFIEL]
Jinto!

507
00:24:46,541 --> 00:24:48,375
The enemy doesn't seem
to be firing any mines

508
00:24:48,458 --> 00:24:49,708
as a counter attack!

509
00:24:49,791 --> 00:24:50,916
So, Chief of Staff,

510
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,250
you know what you've
gotta do here, right?

511
00:24:53,333 --> 00:24:55,625
[COMM. OFFICER] The enemy
fleet has started to advance!

512
00:24:55,708 --> 00:24:57,583
[SPOOR] I love it when
people make their entrance

513
00:24:57,666 --> 00:24:59,000
right on cue!

514
00:24:59,083 --> 00:25:01,875
Tell all ships under our
command to prepare for battle!

515
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:03,833
All ships fire
challenge signals!

516
00:25:03,916 --> 00:25:05,250
[ <i>DARKSES</i> OFFICER C] The enemy
fleet's passing through

517
00:25:05,333 --> 00:25:06,500
the Lobnas Gate!

518
00:25:06,583 --> 00:25:08,458
[GABORT]
Looks like we didn't make it.

519
00:25:08,541 --> 00:25:09,916
[LAFIEL]
Jinto...
