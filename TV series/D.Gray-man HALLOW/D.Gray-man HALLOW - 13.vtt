00:00:10.051 --> 00:00:11.302 position:50% align:center
Well, we're heading out.

00:00:11.386 --> 00:00:14.931 position:50% align:center
So um, thanks
for watching after me.

00:00:15.015 --> 00:00:17.058 position:50% align:center
You take care of
yourself, Allen.

00:00:17.142 --> 00:00:18.351 position:50% align:center
[ALLEN]
Thanks, Barba.

00:00:18.435 --> 00:00:19.728 position:50% align:center
You too, okay?

00:00:19.811 --> 00:00:22.939 position:50% align:center
So long then,
little Allen Walker.

00:00:23.023 --> 00:00:24.190 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:00:24.274 --> 00:00:26.317 position:50% align:center
What's with the
sudden set of bug eyes?

00:00:26.401 --> 00:00:27.861 position:50% align:center
[ALLEN]
Uh, well,

00:00:27.944 --> 00:00:32.240 position:50% align:center
it's just that... Walker is
Mana's last name, and you know,

00:00:32.323 --> 00:00:34.451 position:50% align:center
I'm not part of his family.

00:00:34.534 --> 00:00:36.619 position:50% align:center
It doesn't seem right
to take his name.

00:00:36.703 --> 00:00:38.288 position:50% align:center
That's all.

00:00:38.371 --> 00:00:39.664 position:50% align:center
[CROSS]
Hmm...

00:00:39.748 --> 00:00:40.999 position:50% align:center
Walker.

00:00:41.082 --> 00:00:42.125 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:00:42.208 --> 00:00:44.085 position:50% align:center
Why the hell not?

00:00:44.169 --> 00:00:46.713 position:50% align:center
One who walks forward.

00:00:46.796 --> 00:00:48.048 position:50% align:center
Walker.

00:00:48.131 --> 00:00:50.425 position:50% align:center
It fits you perfectly.

00:00:50.508 --> 00:00:51.676 position:50% align:center
Yeah, It really does.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.678 position:50% align:center
Yep. That's who you are.

00:00:53.762 --> 00:00:55.472 position:50% align:center
You really think so?

00:00:55.555 --> 00:00:57.766 position:50% align:center
Allen Walker, huh?

00:00:59.225 --> 00:01:01.936 position:50% align:center
[MOTHER] Hm...
Not that I realized it then,

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.648 position:50% align:center
but it was a prophecy
as much as a name.

00:02:40.577 --> 00:02:42.245 position:50% align:center
[BARBA]
Mother!

00:02:42.328 --> 00:02:44.372 position:50% align:center
Mother, look what I found!

00:02:44.456 --> 00:02:45.081 position:50% align:center
Look!

00:02:45.165 --> 00:02:46.624 position:50% align:center
Oh, I fell asleep.

00:02:46.708 --> 00:02:48.585 position:50% align:center
I'm getting too old.

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:50.670 position:50% align:center
Ta-da!

00:02:50.754 --> 00:02:54.007 position:50% align:center
It's Allen's cute,
little clown outfit!

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.258 position:50% align:center
Well, look at that.

00:02:55.342 --> 00:02:57.302 position:50% align:center
Where in the world did
you find that old thing?

00:02:57.385 --> 00:02:59.512 position:50% align:center
[BARBA chuckles]
In the priest's room, of course.

00:02:59.596 --> 00:03:01.389 position:50% align:center
You told me to
tidy up his stuff.

00:03:01.473 --> 00:03:04.184 position:50% align:center
Really brings back some
memories, doesn't it?

00:03:04.267 --> 00:03:07.937 position:50% align:center
If there's one thing I regret
from that time, well, I mean...

00:03:08.021 --> 00:03:09.731 position:50% align:center
It was never the right moment.

00:03:09.814 --> 00:03:11.983 position:50% align:center
But I always dreamed
Allen would teach me

00:03:12.067 --> 00:03:15.612 position:50% align:center
how to do the clown
dance with him!

00:03:15.695 --> 00:03:17.697 position:50% align:center
[MOTHER]
Hmm...

00:03:17.781 --> 00:03:20.367 position:50% align:center
All those years ago.

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:21.576 position:50% align:center
[CROSS]
Mother.

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:23.036 position:50% align:center
[MOTHER] Can't say there
was much of a chance

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:25.288 position:50% align:center
for clowning around.

00:03:25.372 --> 00:03:27.207 position:50% align:center
[ALLEN screams]

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:28.375 position:50% align:center
[MOTHER]
A tortured child

00:03:28.458 --> 00:03:30.919 position:50% align:center
who turned someone
he loved into an Akuma.

00:03:31.002 --> 00:03:32.754 position:50% align:center
[screams]

00:03:32.837 --> 00:03:35.465 position:50% align:center
[MOTHER] The left side of his
face had been slashed open.

00:03:35.548 --> 00:03:37.842 position:50% align:center
It was red and swollen.

00:03:37.926 --> 00:03:40.595 position:50% align:center
He was in horrible pain
for well over a month.

00:03:40.679 --> 00:03:42.180 position:50% align:center
The poor child screamed so much

00:03:42.263 --> 00:03:44.849 position:50% align:center
that he eventually
lost his voice.

00:03:44.933 --> 00:03:49.354 position:50% align:center
But the thing that was
most injured was his mind.

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:57.987 position:50% align:center
[CROSS growls]
Dammit!

00:03:58.071 --> 00:04:00.448 position:50% align:center
The brat won't
even touch his food!

00:04:00.532 --> 00:04:02.450 position:50% align:center
He's a child who's been
through a great shock.

00:04:02.534 --> 00:04:04.285 position:50% align:center
You need to feed him yourself.

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:06.705 position:50% align:center
Uh! What?

00:04:07.747 --> 00:04:09.541 position:50% align:center
[CROSS] You mean you
want me to blow on his food

00:04:09.624 --> 00:04:11.751 position:50% align:center
and say, "Open wide,"
like a woman?

00:04:11.835 --> 00:04:15.338 position:50% align:center
I may be your patron, but
that is where I draw the line.

00:04:15.422 --> 00:04:19.467 position:50% align:center
I have no desire to personally
help the Fourteenth.

00:04:20.635 --> 00:04:22.887 position:50% align:center
You've been searching
for the host for 30 years,

00:04:22.971 --> 00:04:25.390 position:50% align:center
and you've finally
found him, right?

00:04:25.473 --> 00:04:28.977 position:50% align:center
Are ya really gonna
let him starve to death?

00:04:32.772 --> 00:04:35.316 position:50% align:center
I didn't think he'd turn
out to be a little kid.

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.526 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:04:36.609 --> 00:04:39.821 position:50% align:center
A full 30 years have
elapsed since Nea died.

00:04:39.904 --> 00:04:41.197 position:50% align:center
So how is it?

00:04:41.281 --> 00:04:44.242 position:50% align:center
How could a ten-year-old boy
turn out to be the host?

00:04:44.325 --> 00:04:46.703 position:50% align:center
It's just... I'm clueless.

00:04:46.786 --> 00:04:49.539 position:50% align:center
I don't know how to take
care of a damn child.

00:04:49.622 --> 00:04:51.624 position:50% align:center
Well, he might be a child,

00:04:51.708 --> 00:04:54.461 position:50% align:center
but he was the one who
appeared before Mana, right?

00:04:54.544 --> 00:04:56.796 position:50% align:center
Sorry he didn't turn out
to be the lowlife scumbag

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.090 position:50% align:center
you were expecting
the host to be.

00:05:04.429 --> 00:05:06.264 position:50% align:center
What do you mean by that?

00:05:06.348 --> 00:05:07.349 position:50% align:center
Forget it.

00:05:07.432 --> 00:05:09.893 position:50% align:center
Just go feed the
boy already, will you?

00:05:22.989 --> 00:05:25.283 position:50% align:center
[BARBA]
Jeez, Mr. Priest.

00:05:25.867 --> 00:05:27.285 position:50% align:center
Really, Mr. Priest!

00:05:27.369 --> 00:05:31.790 position:50% align:center
You're gonna break the tub
if you keep stomping like that!

00:05:31.873 --> 00:05:34.501 position:50% align:center
All of that booze has
burned away your taste buds.

00:05:34.584 --> 00:05:36.920 position:50% align:center
That smells just horrible.

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:55.188 position:50% align:center
[CROSS] Did you really
love Mana that much?

00:05:56.064 --> 00:05:58.024 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:05:58.108 --> 00:06:00.652 position:50% align:center
Just try to fight it, Allen.

00:06:00.735 --> 00:06:05.115 position:50% align:center
I'm sure you
remember what he said,

00:06:05.198 --> 00:06:10.537 position:50% align:center
"Never stop.
Always keep walking."

00:06:18.211 --> 00:06:20.171 position:50% align:center
[CROSS]
Allen finally spoke.

00:06:20.255 --> 00:06:22.507 position:50% align:center
Well, this is fantastic news!

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:24.092 position:50% align:center
Here! Have a drink.

00:06:24.175 --> 00:06:25.760 position:50% align:center
We should celebrate.

00:06:28.054 --> 00:06:30.598 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:06:31.266 --> 00:06:34.978 position:50% align:center
He's taken on
Mana's manner of speech.

00:06:35.061 --> 00:06:36.646 position:50% align:center
I've been keeping an eye on him

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:39.024 position:50% align:center
ever since the first
moment he met Mana.

00:06:39.107 --> 00:06:41.776 position:50% align:center
He was always
angry and rebellious.

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:43.236 position:50% align:center
A foulmouthed brat.

00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:46.406 position:50% align:center
The complete opposite of Mana.

00:06:46.489 --> 00:06:48.241 position:50% align:center
[MOTHER] I don't really see
why that's a problem

00:06:48.324 --> 00:06:50.702 position:50% align:center
if it's keeping him alive.

00:06:50.785 --> 00:06:52.203 position:50% align:center
He'll eventually be swallowed up

00:06:52.287 --> 00:06:55.206 position:50% align:center
by the Fourteenth
and disappear, won't he?

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:56.541 position:50% align:center
You might as well let him live

00:06:56.624 --> 00:06:59.336 position:50% align:center
with the memories of Mana
until that day comes.

00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:02.130 position:50% align:center
If that's what's keeping
him happy, so be it.

00:07:02.213 --> 00:07:03.840 position:50% align:center
Better than him
being a vegetable.

00:07:03.923 --> 00:07:06.009 position:50% align:center
I guess you're right.

00:07:11.723 --> 00:07:15.769 position:50% align:center
Once Nea comes back, we
won't have to worry about him.

00:07:15.852 --> 00:07:19.230 position:50% align:center
I mean, who gives a damn
what happens to the kid.

00:07:22.192 --> 00:07:26.821 position:50% align:center
[MOTHER] Cross Marian, I wonder
if you're still alive and well?

00:07:29.366 --> 00:07:31.368 position:50% align:center
But the real question
is if the Fourteenth

00:07:31.451 --> 00:07:35.080 position:50% align:center
has swallowed Allen
and replaced him yet.

00:07:35.163 --> 00:07:38.875 position:50% align:center
[CROSS] Who gives a damn
what happens to the kid?

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:43.672 position:50% align:center
[bell ringing]

00:07:43.755 --> 00:07:44.589 position:50% align:center
A visitor, huh?

00:07:44.673 --> 00:07:46.257 position:50% align:center
Now who could that be?

00:07:51.137 --> 00:07:52.389 position:50% align:center
Ahh!

00:07:52.472 --> 00:07:53.640 position:50% align:center
Mother!

00:07:53.723 --> 00:07:57.018 position:50% align:center
Speak of the devil,
and he shall appear!

00:08:00.563 --> 00:08:02.065 position:50% align:center
[MOTHER]
Yeah, right, you idiot.

00:08:02.148 --> 00:08:04.943 position:50% align:center
"Who gives a damn" my ass.

00:08:05.026 --> 00:08:08.697 position:50% align:center
I know for a fact that
you cared about Allen.

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:12.992 position:50% align:center
If you hadn't, he wouldn't
have such fine eyes.

00:08:14.119 --> 00:08:16.996 position:50% align:center
[MOTHER] I always had
a feeling you cared.

00:08:19.332 --> 00:08:21.960 position:50% align:center
[DESIRAS] You're telling me
Road protected Allen Walker,

00:08:22.043 --> 00:08:24.421 position:50% align:center
and then disappeared
into thin air?

00:08:24.504 --> 00:08:25.839 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:08:25.922 --> 00:08:28.925 position:50% align:center
Apocryphos is even more
troublesome than we expected.

00:08:29.009 --> 00:08:32.220 position:50% align:center
We held him back and helped
the boy escape, but that's all.

00:08:32.303 --> 00:08:35.181 position:50% align:center
I don't think we
inflicted any real damage.

00:08:35.265 --> 00:08:37.058 position:50% align:center
He's already following the boy.

00:08:37.142 --> 00:08:38.685 position:50% align:center
Trust me.

00:08:38.768 --> 00:08:39.894 position:50% align:center
So...

00:08:39.978 --> 00:08:41.563 position:50% align:center
Did you guys manage
to get anything useful

00:08:41.646 --> 00:08:44.566 position:50% align:center
about the Fourteenth
from Bookman?

00:08:44.649 --> 00:08:45.817 position:50% align:center
Not really.

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:48.778 position:50% align:center
As you can see,
he's not exactly cooperative.

00:08:50.947 --> 00:08:53.283 position:50% align:center
[BOOKMAN]
An autonomous form of Innocence.

00:08:53.366 --> 00:08:54.659 position:50% align:center
Apocryphos.

00:08:54.743 --> 00:08:56.494 position:50% align:center
Allen Walker's desertion.

00:08:56.578 --> 00:08:58.580 position:50% align:center
The wheels are finally moving.

00:08:58.663 --> 00:09:01.416 position:50% align:center
This is the history
we need to record!

00:09:01.499 --> 00:09:02.792 position:50% align:center
[JOYD]
What the?

00:09:02.876 --> 00:09:03.835 position:50% align:center
Hey, hey.

00:09:03.918 --> 00:09:07.005 position:50% align:center
The cyclops looks half dead.

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:10.967 position:50% align:center
[BOOKMAN]
Lavi.

00:09:11.051 --> 00:09:12.218 position:50% align:center
[JOYD]
Oh, hey, Feedra.

00:09:12.302 --> 00:09:14.471 position:50% align:center
You injected an
Exorcist named Choazii

00:09:14.554 --> 00:09:15.972 position:50% align:center
with your Poaz, didn't you?

00:09:16.056 --> 00:09:18.141 position:50% align:center
[FEEDRA]
Yeah, want me to kill him?

00:09:18.224 --> 00:09:19.559 position:50% align:center
[JOYD]
No.

00:09:19.642 --> 00:09:22.145 position:50% align:center
Let him go on living with
the Poaz inside his body.

00:09:22.228 --> 00:09:23.730 position:50% align:center
Sure, but why?

00:09:23.813 --> 00:09:25.398 position:50% align:center
C'mon, think about it.

00:09:25.482 --> 00:09:27.776 position:50% align:center
We can use it to keep
an eye out for Apocryphos

00:09:27.859 --> 00:09:30.612 position:50% align:center
from inside the Order.

00:09:30.695 --> 00:09:32.572 position:50% align:center
[DESIRAS]
Why would she?

00:09:32.655 --> 00:09:36.326 position:50% align:center
Why would Road protect
Allen Walker and disappear?

00:09:36.409 --> 00:09:38.161 position:50% align:center
My sweet Road!

00:09:38.244 --> 00:09:39.412 position:50% align:center
My dear Road!

00:09:39.496 --> 00:09:40.705 position:50% align:center
My sweet girl!

00:09:40.789 --> 00:09:42.207 position:50% align:center
My sweet Road!

00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:45.168 position:50% align:center
[growls]

00:09:45.251 --> 00:09:46.544 position:50% align:center
She disappeared?

00:09:46.628 --> 00:09:48.296 position:50% align:center
My dearest Road?

00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:50.674 position:50% align:center
Not my Road!

00:09:50.757 --> 00:09:52.092 position:50% align:center
Will you calm down?

00:09:52.175 --> 00:09:53.551 position:50% align:center
It's not like she's dead.

00:09:53.635 --> 00:09:56.221 position:50% align:center
Our Noah Memories
would sense it if she was.

00:09:56.304 --> 00:09:59.391 position:50% align:center
I'm guessing her dreams
just temporarily broke her.

00:09:59.474 --> 00:10:01.434 position:50% align:center
She'll be back.

00:10:01.518 --> 00:10:02.894 position:50% align:center
[DESIRAS]
Bookman.

00:10:02.977 --> 00:10:05.230 position:50% align:center
What kind of relationship
did Road and the Fourteenth

00:10:05.313 --> 00:10:07.482 position:50% align:center
have in the past?

00:10:07.565 --> 00:10:09.984 position:50% align:center
You know the answer, don't you?

00:10:10.068 --> 00:10:12.696 position:50% align:center
What kind of
relationship was it?

00:10:13.905 --> 00:10:17.033 position:50% align:center
What kind of
relationship did they have?

00:10:17.492 --> 00:10:18.785 position:50% align:center
[screams]

00:10:18.868 --> 00:10:19.994 position:50% align:center
Lavi! No!

00:10:20.078 --> 00:10:22.247 position:50% align:center
[screams]

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:23.623 position:50% align:center
Quiet, old man.

00:10:23.707 --> 00:10:25.166 position:50% align:center
Don't tell them anything.

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:27.877 position:50% align:center
No matter what they do to me!

00:10:27.961 --> 00:10:28.795 position:50% align:center
Well?

00:10:28.878 --> 00:10:30.922 position:50% align:center
Spit it out, Bookman.

00:10:47.105 --> 00:10:48.815 position:50% align:center
Director Lvellie.

00:10:48.898 --> 00:10:51.735 position:50% align:center
The Asian Branch Chief
has requested to see you.

00:10:52.902 --> 00:10:55.530 position:50% align:center
[LVELLIE] Inform him
that I'll join him shortly.

00:10:57.532 --> 00:10:59.451 position:50% align:center
[ORDER STAFF A]
This is HQ. Return approved.

00:10:59.534 --> 00:11:01.661 position:50% align:center
Now opening Gate 22.

00:11:03.121 --> 00:11:04.122 position:50% align:center
Ah, holy crud.

00:11:04.205 --> 00:11:06.583 position:50% align:center
I'm as worn out
as an old doormat.

00:11:06.833 --> 00:11:08.501 position:50% align:center
Hey Timothy, welcome home.

00:11:08.585 --> 00:11:09.502 position:50% align:center
You are flushed!

00:11:09.586 --> 00:11:11.004 position:50% align:center
Why is your face so red?

00:11:11.087 --> 00:11:13.048 position:50% align:center
Do you have a fever?

00:11:13.131 --> 00:11:15.258 position:50% align:center
Thanks for the lift, Master.

00:11:15.342 --> 00:11:17.344 position:50% align:center
Jeez, I told you
to wear a raincoat.

00:11:17.427 --> 00:11:19.179 position:50% align:center
This is what you get.

00:11:19.262 --> 00:11:21.556 position:50% align:center
We're leaving on assignment
in one hour, Chaozii.

00:11:21.639 --> 00:11:22.223 position:50% align:center
Got it?

00:11:22.307 --> 00:11:23.058 position:50% align:center
Got it!

00:11:23.141 --> 00:11:24.100 position:50% align:center
[DOCTOR]
What?

00:11:24.184 --> 00:11:25.518 position:50% align:center
Hey, not so fast!

00:11:25.602 --> 00:11:27.937 position:50% align:center
You literally just
returned from a mission!

00:11:28.021 --> 00:11:29.314 position:50% align:center
You'll strain your arm!

00:11:29.397 --> 00:11:31.066 position:50% align:center
I'll get some rest on the train.

00:11:31.149 --> 00:11:31.983 position:50% align:center
No way!

00:11:32.067 --> 00:11:34.194 position:50% align:center
As your doctor, I insist--

00:11:34.277 --> 00:11:35.320 position:50% align:center
[CHAOZII]
Activate!

00:11:35.403 --> 00:11:37.489 position:50% align:center
Arm of Baptisma!

00:11:41.451 --> 00:11:44.788 position:50% align:center
I'll only get depressed if
I'm not out on assignment.

00:11:44.871 --> 00:11:49.042 position:50% align:center
If I wasn't so damn worthless,
Lavi and Bookman--

00:11:49.125 --> 00:11:51.211 position:50% align:center
they never
would've been captured.

00:11:51.294 --> 00:11:54.464 position:50% align:center
And now, well,
now that Kanda is dead.

00:11:54.547 --> 00:11:57.634 position:50% align:center
We're running
short on Exorcists.

00:11:57.717 --> 00:12:00.470 position:50% align:center
There'll be plenty of time
to rest when the war is over.

00:12:00.553 --> 00:12:02.764 position:50% align:center
We've got Akuma to destroy.

00:12:08.311 --> 00:12:11.147 position:50% align:center
I'm sure Bookman
and Lavi are still alive.

00:12:11.231 --> 00:12:12.816 position:50% align:center
They'll be okay.

00:12:12.899 --> 00:12:14.401 position:50% align:center
I hope so.

00:12:14.484 --> 00:12:15.735 position:50% align:center
Also...

00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:25.286 position:50% align:center
[CHAOZII] You're thinking
about Allen Walker.

00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:27.706 position:50% align:center
Why the hell do you
care about him?

00:12:27.789 --> 00:12:30.291 position:50% align:center
Not only did that traitor
kill Inspector Link,

00:12:30.375 --> 00:12:33.420 position:50% align:center
he ran away with the Noah!

00:12:33.503 --> 00:12:37.590 position:50% align:center
If I ever see Walker again,
I will fight him to the death!

00:12:41.845 --> 00:12:43.430 position:50% align:center
Chaozii said that?

00:12:43.513 --> 00:12:44.305 position:50% align:center
[MARIE]
Yeah.

00:12:44.389 --> 00:12:45.765 position:50% align:center
It's been three months now.

00:12:45.849 --> 00:12:47.517 position:50% align:center
That's a long time, y'know?

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:50.645 position:50% align:center
Some of our comrades
have lost faith in Allen.

00:12:50.729 --> 00:12:54.399 position:50% align:center
He's still got plenty
of believers though.

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:56.317 position:50% align:center
How are you?

00:12:56.401 --> 00:12:58.570 position:50% align:center
Your wounds hurt?

00:12:58.653 --> 00:13:00.864 position:50% align:center
I'm fine.

00:13:00.947 --> 00:13:03.283 position:50% align:center
What's it like to be
a real friend?

00:13:03.366 --> 00:13:04.284 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:13:04.367 --> 00:13:07.495 position:50% align:center
I couldn't say
anything to Allen.

00:13:07.579 --> 00:13:10.290 position:50% align:center
I said that I would
always believe in him.

00:13:10.373 --> 00:13:13.626 position:50% align:center
But when I found him leaving
us without any explanation,

00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:16.546 position:50% align:center
there was nothing
I could say to him.

00:13:16.629 --> 00:13:18.506 position:50% align:center
I wanted to help him, but...

00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:19.674 position:50% align:center
...I couldn't.

00:13:19.758 --> 00:13:21.468 position:50% align:center
As much as I wanted to,

00:13:21.551 --> 00:13:23.720 position:50% align:center
I just wasn't prepared to.

00:13:27.432 --> 00:13:29.434 position:50% align:center
I claimed to be his friend,

00:13:29.517 --> 00:13:33.104 position:50% align:center
but then I chose
the Order over him.

00:13:36.024 --> 00:13:38.610 position:50% align:center
Hey, you didn't
do anything wrong.

00:13:38.693 --> 00:13:42.238 position:50% align:center
You have a bond with Komui
and everyone else at the Order.

00:13:42.322 --> 00:13:45.158 position:50% align:center
They've been a part
of your life for many years.

00:13:45.241 --> 00:13:47.035 position:50% align:center
It's the same for me.

00:13:47.118 --> 00:13:48.953 position:50% align:center
Those bonds run deep.

00:13:49.037 --> 00:13:51.581 position:50% align:center
That's exactly why I'm here.

00:13:51.664 --> 00:13:53.625 position:50% align:center
We have a bond with Allen, too.

00:13:53.708 --> 00:13:55.710 position:50% align:center
One doesn't negate the other.

00:13:55.794 --> 00:13:59.214 position:50% align:center
And with Bookman and Lavi,
Kanda as well,

00:13:59.297 --> 00:14:04.636 position:50% align:center
all of our comrades that we've
fought beside and laughed with,

00:14:04.719 --> 00:14:09.849 position:50% align:center
we may be separated now,
but we'll always be connected.

00:14:11.601 --> 00:14:13.978 position:50% align:center
[MARIE]
Well then, we should go.

00:14:14.062 --> 00:14:15.397 position:50% align:center
The gate will be opening soon.

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:16.314 position:50% align:center
[LENALEE]
Yeah.

00:14:16.398 --> 00:14:17.982 position:50% align:center
Aww!

00:14:20.402 --> 00:14:22.153 position:50% align:center
Over here!

00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:25.198 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:14:25.532 --> 00:14:26.783 position:50% align:center
[BOY A]
Thank you!

00:14:26.866 --> 00:14:28.493 position:50% align:center
[LENALEE gasps]

00:14:29.619 --> 00:14:32.163 position:50% align:center
Is there something wrong,
Leenalee?

00:14:39.462 --> 00:14:41.756 position:50% align:center
Why, you idiot?

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:43.717 position:50% align:center
Why did you come back?

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:48.221 position:50% align:center
You were supposed
to be... to be free.

00:14:48.304 --> 00:14:50.140 position:50% align:center
You damn fool.

00:14:50.223 --> 00:14:52.225 position:50% align:center
[KANDA]
Hmph.

00:14:55.103 --> 00:14:57.605 position:50% align:center
[KANDA] You could just say,
"Welcome home."

00:15:01.818 --> 00:15:05.030 position:50% align:center
[KANDA] "Whatever happens, I'll
always be an Exorcist," huh?

00:15:05.113 --> 00:15:06.698 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:15:06.781 --> 00:15:08.616 position:50% align:center
That sounds like
something he'd say.

00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:11.661 position:50% align:center
The Order is employing all of
their resources to find him,

00:15:11.745 --> 00:15:12.871 position:50% align:center
but we still haven't yet.

00:15:12.954 --> 00:15:14.414 position:50% align:center
[MARIE]
All of that aside,

00:15:14.497 --> 00:15:17.625 position:50% align:center
I'm just surprised that you
knew where to look for us.

00:15:17.709 --> 00:15:19.544 position:50% align:center
Don't go flattering yourselves.

00:15:19.627 --> 00:15:24.174 position:50% align:center
I was just watching that gate,
and you guys came along.

00:15:24.257 --> 00:15:25.884 position:50% align:center
Wait. What?

00:15:25.967 --> 00:15:26.843 position:50% align:center
Look at you.

00:15:26.926 --> 00:15:28.261 position:50% align:center
Your face looks awful.

00:15:28.345 --> 00:15:29.220 position:50% align:center
What?

00:15:29.304 --> 00:15:30.889 position:50% align:center
Hey, you stop right there Kanda!

00:15:30.972 --> 00:15:32.599 position:50% align:center
I haven't seen you in months
and that's what you say?

00:15:32.682 --> 00:15:33.433 position:50% align:center
Forget the bandages.

00:15:33.516 --> 00:15:34.893 position:50% align:center
It's all swollen and puffy.

00:15:34.976 --> 00:15:37.896 position:50% align:center
I guess you've been crying
yourself to sleep again.

00:15:37.979 --> 00:15:38.855 position:50% align:center
[LENALEE]
Come here!

00:15:38.938 --> 00:15:41.733 position:50% align:center
I'm serious, you surly jerk!

00:15:47.113 --> 00:15:49.157 position:50% align:center
What... Kanda?

00:15:49.824 --> 00:15:52.285 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:15:52.369 --> 00:15:53.411 position:50% align:center
What are you doing?

00:15:53.495 --> 00:15:54.621 position:50% align:center
Well, I... I...

00:15:54.704 --> 00:15:56.289 position:50% align:center
I can't believe you're real!

00:15:56.373 --> 00:15:59.084 position:50% align:center
I'm just making sure
I'm not hallucinating!

00:15:59.167 --> 00:16:01.711 position:50% align:center
Did you make sure
that Alma Karma is dead?

00:16:01.795 --> 00:16:04.297 position:50% align:center
I won't speak to you about him.

00:16:04.381 --> 00:16:07.801 position:50% align:center
All you need to know is
I haven't forgiven the Order.

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:10.387 position:50% align:center
[LVELLIE]
Hmph.

00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:12.972 position:50% align:center
Then why did you even
bother to come back?

00:16:14.974 --> 00:16:17.852 position:50% align:center
He's here, Master Zu.

00:16:26.027 --> 00:16:27.529 position:50% align:center
He's been bedridden awhile.

00:16:27.612 --> 00:16:30.699 position:50% align:center
He mostly sleeps these days.

00:16:30.782 --> 00:16:33.034 position:50% align:center
That's Mugen, he's holding.

00:16:33.743 --> 00:16:35.995 position:50% align:center
Why return to this place?

00:16:36.079 --> 00:16:37.747 position:50% align:center
Alma.

00:16:37.831 --> 00:16:41.668 position:50% align:center
Has your body managed to fully
heal after your fight with him?

00:16:42.711 --> 00:16:45.505 position:50% align:center
[ZU] You've figured out
the truth, haven't you?

00:16:48.008 --> 00:16:50.427 position:50% align:center
[ZU]
It was me.

00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:52.595 position:50% align:center
The Order's human
experimentation

00:16:52.679 --> 00:16:55.473 position:50% align:center
to reinforce the ranks
of their Exorcists.

00:16:55.557 --> 00:16:58.852 position:50% align:center
Atrocities committed in the
name of winning the crusade.

00:16:58.935 --> 00:17:01.438 position:50% align:center
I directed the entire operation.

00:17:01.521 --> 00:17:05.108 position:50% align:center
That shameful,
violent, tragic history.

00:17:05.191 --> 00:17:07.527 position:50% align:center
I'm responsible for all of it.

00:17:07.610 --> 00:17:09.195 position:50% align:center
I was governed by my pride.

00:17:09.279 --> 00:17:11.906 position:50% align:center
And I nourished that
pride with cruelty,

00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:15.618 position:50% align:center
while desperately clinging
to power at Central Agency.

00:17:15.702 --> 00:17:17.787 position:50% align:center
I made many people suffer.

00:17:17.871 --> 00:17:21.041 position:50% align:center
All to advance the Chang family.

00:17:21.124 --> 00:17:23.293 position:50% align:center
Tui and the others
were given no choice

00:17:23.376 --> 00:17:26.796 position:50% align:center
but to inherit the
mistakes I had created.

00:17:30.717 --> 00:17:32.677 position:50% align:center
It was all my doing.

00:17:32.761 --> 00:17:35.597 position:50% align:center
The worst demon of them all.

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:38.266 position:50% align:center
It was always me.

00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:39.893 position:50% align:center
It's me.

00:17:44.606 --> 00:17:45.940 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:17:46.024 --> 00:17:47.692 position:50% align:center
What is this?

00:17:47.776 --> 00:17:51.321 position:50% align:center
Are these Lotus flowers?

00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:54.949 position:50% align:center
I guess I'll have some
company in hell then.

00:17:55.033 --> 00:17:58.953 position:50% align:center
Ah! I suppose so.

00:17:59.037 --> 00:18:01.498 position:50% align:center
[KANDA]
Awaken, Mugen.

00:18:06.044 --> 00:18:09.297 position:50% align:center
It... Mugen
transformed into a cube.

00:18:09.381 --> 00:18:11.758 position:50% align:center
Did it become a Crystal-Type?

00:18:11.841 --> 00:18:13.802 position:50% align:center
[LENALEE]
Kanda, wait!

00:18:15.261 --> 00:18:16.137 position:50% align:center
Are you sure?

00:18:16.221 --> 00:18:17.472 position:50% align:center
Do you really want this?

00:18:17.555 --> 00:18:19.140 position:50% align:center
After everything the Order
has inflicted upon you

00:18:19.224 --> 00:18:21.101 position:50% align:center
over all these years?

00:18:21.184 --> 00:18:23.228 position:50% align:center
The Order stole your past.

00:18:23.311 --> 00:18:25.313 position:50% align:center
They even took away
the one you loved.

00:18:25.397 --> 00:18:28.274 position:50% align:center
You finally had
the chance to be free.

00:18:29.859 --> 00:18:31.236 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:18:31.319 --> 00:18:32.904 position:50% align:center
[KANDA]
Huh. Look at that.

00:18:32.987 --> 00:18:35.782 position:50% align:center
It's gone from
crystal to liquid.

00:18:35.865 --> 00:18:37.075 position:50% align:center
Don't freak out.

00:18:37.158 --> 00:18:38.243 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:42.247 position:50% align:center
What the?

00:18:43.123 --> 00:18:45.041 position:50% align:center
[KOMUI, BAK]
Hey! Kanda! You perv!

00:18:45.125 --> 00:18:46.668 position:50% align:center
Stop! Stop!

00:18:46.751 --> 00:18:49.879 position:50% align:center
And now,
I'm actually free at last.

00:18:49.963 --> 00:18:51.840 position:50% align:center
This is my decision.

00:18:51.923 --> 00:18:53.591 position:50% align:center
My name is Yu Kanda.

00:18:53.675 --> 00:18:56.886 position:50% align:center
And I have chosen
to be an Exorcist.

00:19:00.473 --> 00:19:02.934 position:50% align:center
[ZU] Years ago,
there was an Exorcist

00:19:03.018 --> 00:19:05.854 position:50% align:center
who likened herself to a flower.

00:19:05.937 --> 00:19:09.274 position:50% align:center
How could I have allowed
myself to forget those words?

00:19:09.357 --> 00:19:11.609 position:50% align:center
To forget those young soldiers

00:19:11.693 --> 00:19:14.529 position:50% align:center
and the name of that flower?

00:19:14.612 --> 00:19:16.531 position:50% align:center
Mugen, Activate.

00:19:16.614 --> 00:19:18.783 position:50% align:center
[ZU]
It was never an illusion, Kanda.

00:19:18.867 --> 00:19:20.035 position:50% align:center
I was wrong.

00:19:20.118 --> 00:19:22.746 position:50% align:center
You truly are a mighty Lotus.

00:19:22.829 --> 00:19:27.917 position:50% align:center
And you will always grow
straight towards the sky.

00:19:31.588 --> 00:19:34.758 position:50% align:center
Never thought that I'd see
you wear that uniform again.

00:19:37.385 --> 00:19:38.803 position:50% align:center
What's with the look?

00:19:38.887 --> 00:19:41.056 position:50% align:center
Are you really sure that
you want to do this?

00:19:41.139 --> 00:19:44.476 position:50% align:center
I'm the one who awakened
the Noah within him.

00:19:44.559 --> 00:19:45.560 position:50% align:center
You were played.

00:19:45.643 --> 00:19:48.021 position:50% align:center
The Earl used Alma
to manipulate you.

00:19:48.104 --> 00:19:49.564 position:50% align:center
It was all a trap.

00:19:49.647 --> 00:19:52.400 position:50% align:center
And you're not the
only one who fell for it!

00:19:52.484 --> 00:19:54.319 position:50% align:center
[KANDA]
I didn't care if he woke up

00:19:54.402 --> 00:19:57.072 position:50% align:center
or about what might
happen to the Order.

00:19:57.155 --> 00:19:59.324 position:50% align:center
I didn't even think about it.

00:19:59.407 --> 00:20:00.492 position:50% align:center
What?

00:20:00.575 --> 00:20:03.078 position:50% align:center
I was never gonna
try to save short stack.

00:20:03.161 --> 00:20:05.121 position:50% align:center
I never wanted to trust him.

00:20:05.205 --> 00:20:06.706 position:50% align:center
And so...

00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:08.792 position:50% align:center
I ignored the signs.

00:20:08.875 --> 00:20:12.671 position:50% align:center
I saw him start to turn
in Paris, and I didn't care.

00:20:12.754 --> 00:20:15.090 position:50% align:center
What? You mean,
at the orphanage?

00:20:15.173 --> 00:20:18.009 position:50% align:center
I didn't even bother
reporting it to Komui.

00:20:18.093 --> 00:20:20.261 position:50% align:center
Because... I hated the Order.

00:20:20.345 --> 00:20:22.389 position:50% align:center
Even more than the Noah.

00:20:22.472 --> 00:20:23.973 position:50% align:center
Oh, Kanda.

00:20:24.057 --> 00:20:25.266 position:50% align:center
Sorry, Lenalee.

00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:26.267 position:50% align:center
I just can't help it.

00:20:26.351 --> 00:20:28.103 position:50% align:center
I'm not like you guys.

00:20:28.186 --> 00:20:30.563 position:50% align:center
I was ready to kill Alma.

00:20:30.647 --> 00:20:34.150 position:50% align:center
But Allen didn't give up
on trying to save us.

00:20:34.234 --> 00:20:37.195 position:50% align:center
My feelings towards
the Order haven't changed.

00:20:37.278 --> 00:20:38.613 position:50% align:center
But Allen?

00:20:38.697 --> 00:20:40.657 position:50% align:center
I regret what I've done.

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:43.493 position:50% align:center
I can't die in peace
with that over my head.

00:20:43.576 --> 00:20:46.204 position:50% align:center
[LENALEE]
I see now.

00:20:46.287 --> 00:20:50.333 position:50% align:center
He's chosen to come back to
the Order and be an Exorcist...

00:20:50.417 --> 00:20:53.420 position:50% align:center
...all so he can help Allen.

00:21:08.184 --> 00:21:15.108 position:50% align:center
[ALLEN grunts]

00:21:15.191 --> 00:21:17.068 position:50% align:center
[CROSS]
So, Allen.

00:21:17.152 --> 00:21:18.236 position:50% align:center
If you think that
you've been forced

00:21:18.319 --> 00:21:22.782 position:50% align:center
to walk a certain path
by either of us...

00:21:22.866 --> 00:21:26.536 position:50% align:center
Well, you need to
know that you're mistaken.

00:21:40.884 --> 00:21:43.595 position:50% align:center
A path forms behind
you as you walk.

00:21:43.678 --> 00:21:45.680 position:50% align:center
The soil you step
on is compressed,

00:21:45.764 --> 00:21:48.516 position:50% align:center
leaving an imprint of
the course you've chosen.

00:21:51.353 --> 00:21:53.605 position:50% align:center
Now's the time
to walk on your own.

00:21:53.688 --> 00:21:57.442 position:50% align:center
If you haven't
given up, that is.

00:22:02.030 --> 00:22:04.783 position:50% align:center
Hey, Mister,
are you an angel?

00:22:12.749 --> 00:22:16.294 position:50% align:center
[CARDINAL]
You will never escape me, Allen.

00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:22.467 position:50% align:center
[AKUMA A]
I can sense him!

00:22:26.304 --> 00:22:27.472 position:50% align:center
[AKUMA C]
I sense him!

00:22:27.555 --> 00:22:30.934 position:50% align:center
I sense the Fourteenth! Ahhh!

00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:38.358 position:50% align:center
Hang in there, boy.

00:22:38.441 --> 00:22:41.152 position:50% align:center
Don't go givin' up now.

00:22:46.991 --> 00:22:49.327 position:50% align:center
[moans]

00:22:49.411 --> 00:22:52.664 position:50% align:center
You've got some suffering to do.

00:22:52.747 --> 00:22:56.001 position:50% align:center
I guess we'll see if you've got
it in you to settle things.

00:23:00.755 --> 00:23:02.007 position:50% align:center
[CROSS]
Never stop.

00:23:02.090 --> 00:23:04.092 position:50% align:center
Always keep walking.

00:23:12.267 --> 00:23:13.018 position:50% align:center
Get up now.

00:23:13.101 --> 00:23:14.227 position:50% align:center
Walk on your own.

00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:17.022 position:50% align:center
As long as
you haven't given up,

00:23:17.105 --> 00:23:19.024 position:50% align:center
Walker.

00:23:21.401 --> 00:23:23.695 position:50% align:center
Just... walk.

00:23:26.364 --> 00:23:27.824 position:50% align:center
Allen Walker.
