Thank you, Allen Walker.

Why is it...

00:13:01.156 --> 00:13:03.199 position:50% align:center
[ALMA KARMA]
...coming from the sky?

00:13:05.994 --> 00:13:08.079 position:50% align:center
[KANDA]
Alma.

00:13:08.163 --> 00:13:10.957 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Yu?

00:13:11.041 --> 00:13:13.418 position:50% align:center
Let's get out of here together.

00:13:13.501 --> 00:13:17.213 position:50% align:center
We'll go someplace away from
Innocence and the Order.

00:13:17.297 --> 00:13:20.216 position:50% align:center

[KANDA] Yeah, you dummy.
I heard everything.

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:39.611 position:50% align:center
I summon the Ark Gate!

00:13:43.406 --> 00:13:46.701 position:50% align:center
This might be kinda
rough. All right?

00:13:46.785 --> 00:13:48.036 position:50% align:center
Hey-- 

00:13:53.375 --> 00:13:56.920 position:50% align:center

Farewell, Alma, Kanda.

Ark Gate, Adara!

00:14:02.967 --> 00:14:06.513 position:50% align:center
Both the Noah and the Order

Please, Ark. Take them to Mater.

I'm a part of the
Millennium Earl.

00:15:02.569 --> 00:15:04.195 position:50% align:center
That's my curse as an Akuma.

00:15:04.279 --> 00:15:08.366 position:50% align:center
To be connected to him.
And I can feel it.

00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:12.620 position:50% align:center
That poor boy. He's a Noah.

00:15:12.704 --> 00:15:14.414 position:50% align:center
And it's even worse than that.

00:15:14.497 --> 00:15:15.498 position:50% align:center

Promise me you won't
use your Innocence.

00:15:28.678 --> 00:15:30.638 position:50% align:center
I promise.

00:15:30.722 --> 00:15:32.682 position:50% align:center
[ALMA KARMA] Even when the
Dark Matter suffocates

00:15:32.766 --> 00:15:34.851 position:50% align:center
and consumes my soul.

00:15:34.934 --> 00:15:36.227 position:50% align:center
I know.

00:15:37.312 --> 00:15:39.939 position:50% align:center
I still can't forgive the Order.

00:15:40.023 --> 00:15:43.610 position:50% align:center
I hate them. I hate them all.

00:15:44.652 --> 00:15:48.156 position:50% align:center
[ALMA KARMA] But I deserve
to sink into the mud.

00:15:50.825 --> 00:15:55.205 position:50% align:center
[ALMA KARMA] I took their
lives. I killed so many.

00:15:58.875 --> 00:16:01.169 position:50% align:center
[ALMA KARMA]
So many people!

00:16:02.796 --> 00:16:05.840 position:50% align:center
[ALMA KARMA] I even betrayed
you by helping the Earl.

00:16:05.924 --> 00:16:10.053 position:50% align:center
It's okay, Alma.
You're okay now.

00:16:14.683 --> 00:16:17.268 position:50% align:center

I'll be watching you forever.

They're no longer our friends
when they become Akuma.

00:17:50.236 --> 00:17:53.281 position:50% align:center

a fully formed Noah.

You will be left with the choice

00:18:29.275 --> 00:18:33.196 position:50% align:center
of either trusting
the Fourteenth...

00:18:33.279 --> 00:18:35.907 position:50% align:center

00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:39.160 position:50% align:center
Just as you've chosen

He is destined to
become the seed

00:18:40.954 --> 00:18:43.248 position:50% align:center

and there's nothing

00:18:43.331 --> 00:18:45.125 position:50% align:center

That's how deeply rooted
his sorrow had become.

such pain on him.
