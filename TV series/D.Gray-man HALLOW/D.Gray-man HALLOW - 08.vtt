00:18:23.311 --> 00:18:26.189 position:50% align:center
And you've made him
suffer for it!

00:18:26.272 --> 00:18:28.983 position:50% align:center
What are you running
from, Kanda?

00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:38.493 position:50% align:center
Who do you think you are, Allen?

00:18:38.576 --> 00:18:42.080 position:50% align:center
It's your fault that Alma was
transformed into an Akuma.

00:18:42.163 --> 00:18:43.623 position:50% align:center
You destroyed this
branch and turned

00:18:43.707 --> 00:18:45.417 position:50% align:center
the Thirds into monsters.

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:48.837 position:50% align:center
All because the Earl wants
his precious Noah back.

00:18:53.216 --> 00:18:54.843 position:50% align:center
Kanda!

00:18:54.926 --> 00:18:58.304 position:50% align:center
All of this happened
because of you, damn Noah!

00:19:02.017 --> 00:19:05.562 position:50% align:center
[KANDA] If it wasn't for you,
everything would be fine.

00:19:05.645 --> 00:19:07.731 position:50% align:center
What do you even know about me?

00:19:07.814 --> 00:19:09.816 position:50% align:center
Edge End attack!

00:19:09.899 --> 00:19:12.444 position:50% align:center
Gogen... Soul Slicer!

00:19:12.527 --> 00:19:14.612 position:50% align:center
[ALLEN groans]

00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:20.827 position:50% align:center
Stop it. Don't interfere.

00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:24.372 position:50% align:center
I don't have much time.

00:19:24.456 --> 00:19:28.001 position:50% align:center
[ALMA KARMA] As long as
Yu's alive, then I'll--

00:19:28.084 --> 00:19:30.253 position:50% align:center
Someday, I will--

00:19:31.296 --> 00:19:32.422 position:50% align:center
[screams]

00:19:32.505 --> 00:19:35.508 position:50% align:center
[grunts] Why, Alma?

00:19:35.592 --> 00:19:40.305 position:50% align:center
[panting]

00:19:40.388 --> 00:19:41.890 position:50% align:center
[ALLEN]
Alma...

00:19:42.932 --> 00:19:44.559 position:50% align:center
[KANDA yells]

00:19:44.642 --> 00:19:47.228 position:50% align:center
Dammit, Kanda!

00:19:48.271 --> 00:19:50.023 position:50% align:center
[ALLEN] Do you really think
that this will end?

00:19:50.106 --> 00:19:53.276 position:50% align:center
That you'll get any
closure by killing Alma?

00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:55.528 position:50% align:center
[BOTH yelling]

00:19:56.905 --> 00:19:58.823 position:50% align:center
[MILLENNIUM EARL cackles]

00:20:04.287 --> 00:20:11.169 position:50% align:center
[panting]

00:20:11.252 --> 00:20:15.006 position:50% align:center
[ALLEN] Will you just take
a look at Alma's face?

00:20:17.425 --> 00:20:19.886 position:50% align:center
[ALLEN]
Why is he making that face?

00:20:19.969 --> 00:20:22.097 position:50% align:center
I can't tell why.

00:20:23.348 --> 00:20:25.433 position:50% align:center
[coughs]

00:20:25.517 --> 00:20:27.477 position:50% align:center
I don't understand why!

00:20:31.815 --> 00:20:33.525 position:50% align:center
[KANDA]
Short Stack...

00:20:34.901 --> 00:20:36.861 position:50% align:center
Do ya see Allen's body?

00:20:36.945 --> 00:20:38.738 position:50% align:center
He looks like a Noah.

00:20:46.996 --> 00:20:49.082 position:50% align:center
Alma.

00:20:49.165 --> 00:20:52.961 position:50% align:center
This is the end, Yu.

00:20:53.044 --> 00:20:54.045 position:50% align:center
Now, die!

00:20:54.129 --> 00:20:55.839 position:50% align:center
[heartbeats]

00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:00.093 position:50% align:center
[KANDA, ALMA KARMA gasp]

00:21:06.725 --> 00:21:07.976 position:50% align:center
[KANDA]
Alma!

00:21:11.271 --> 00:21:17.610 position:50% align:center
[ALLEN laughs]

00:21:17.694 --> 00:21:20.572 position:50% align:center
Hold on. What just happened?

00:21:20.655 --> 00:21:22.032 position:50% align:center
Is that...?

00:21:22.115 --> 00:21:24.367 position:50% align:center
Is this an earthquake?

00:21:24.451 --> 00:21:27.162 position:50% align:center
[MILLENNIUM EARL]
Thank you so kindly, Yu Kanda!

00:21:27.245 --> 00:21:29.289 position:50% align:center
He's finally awake!

00:21:29.372 --> 00:21:31.374 position:50% align:center
You didn't think about
the repercussions

00:21:31.458 --> 00:21:33.376 position:50% align:center
your Innocence might
have on the dormant Noah

00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:35.003 position:50% align:center
when ya stabbed Allen with it.

00:21:35.086 --> 00:21:37.088 position:50% align:center
Well, thanks to
your carelessness,

00:21:37.172 --> 00:21:38.673 position:50% align:center
the Fourteenth has finally risen

00:21:38.757 --> 00:21:41.176 position:50% align:center
from his gestating
slumber within.

00:21:41.259 --> 00:21:43.553 position:50% align:center
The one thing a Noah
will never forget

00:21:43.636 --> 00:21:45.680 position:50% align:center
is his eternal
hatred towards God

00:21:45.764 --> 00:21:47.307 position:50% align:center
and the cursed Innocence!

00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:50.268 position:50% align:center
Every single slash of
the foul stuff only serves

00:21:50.352 --> 00:21:52.896 position:50% align:center
to further strengthen
their hate!

00:21:52.979 --> 00:21:55.648 position:50% align:center
[KANDA]
I awoke the Fourteenth.

00:21:55.732 --> 00:21:57.275 position:50% align:center
[MILLENNIUM EARL]
I can't thank you enough.

00:21:57.359 --> 00:22:00.653 position:50% align:center
You've brought about the end
of that irritating Allen Walker.

00:22:00.737 --> 00:22:03.365 position:50% align:center
This was The Earl's plan
from the beginning.

00:22:03.448 --> 00:22:06.034 position:50% align:center
He was just using
Kanda and Alma!

00:22:06.117 --> 00:22:10.455 position:50% align:center
Please, no! Make it
stop! Stop it!

00:22:17.045 --> 00:22:19.047 position:50% align:center
Where am I?

00:22:19.130 --> 00:22:23.468 position:50% align:center
[ALLEN]
Tyki? No, that's not him.

00:22:23.551 --> 00:22:25.261 position:50% align:center
Who are you?

00:23:43.798 --> 00:23:46.176 position:50% align:center
[ALLEN]
So is this man the Fourteenth?

00:23:46.259 --> 00:23:47.427 position:50% align:center
I remember the barrier over

00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:50.138 position:50% align:center
the North American
Branch dissipating.

00:23:50.221 --> 00:23:52.974 position:50% align:center
But what I saw with
my left eye was...

00:23:53.058 --> 00:23:53.850 position:50% align:center
Next time:

00:23:53.933 --> 00:23:56.311 position:50% align:center
Night 9, "Little Good-Bye."
