Can't we do something?

Please, Director,

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:14.259 position:50% align:center
[TIMOTHY] It's been a full two
years since my dad got arrested

00:02:14.342 --> 00:02:18.054 position:50% align:center
and I was brought to
the Hearst Orphanage.

00:02:18.138 --> 00:02:21.182 position:50% align:center
It can be kind of
a pain living here,

00:02:23.518 --> 00:02:26.521 position:50% align:center
So I chose to hide my
power all this time.

00:02:28.606 --> 00:02:31.818 position:50% align:center
But... when I saw the
Mother's face that day

00:02:31.901 --> 00:02:35.572 position:50% align:center
I realized my power could
be used as a weapon.

[LEVEL 4]
Are you stupid?

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:28.762 position:50% align:center
Look what you've done.

00:15:28.845 --> 00:15:30.805 position:50% align:center
You stabbed yourself, too.

00:15:30.889 --> 00:15:34.017 position:50% align:center
[ALLEN] This sword is only
capable of harming evil things.

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:36.102 position:50% align:center
It only works on
Noah and Akuma.

What...

00:15:40.982 --> 00:15:43.360 position:50% align:center
Crown... Clown...?

00:15:43.443 --> 00:15:45.987 position:50% align:center
Only works on evil
things, does it?

00:15:46.071 --> 00:15:48.948 position:50% align:center
Maybe you're not
so pure after all.

00:15:49.032 --> 00:15:51.826 position:50% align:center
How else can you explain the
blood pouring out of you?

What's happening?

00:16:00.919 --> 00:16:03.046 position:50% align:center
Crown Clown is hurting him?

[ALLEN groaning]

00:16:04.506 --> 00:16:07.133 position:50% align:center

much sense, does it?

Good... Morn... Ing...

Hey.

[KANDA]
What?

00:16:54.931 --> 00:16:58.184 position:50% align:center
Told you my name is Allen.

00:16:58.268 --> 00:16:59.728 position:50% align:center
[JIJI]
So that's how.

00:16:59.811 --> 00:17:02.522 position:50% align:center
I found one on each
corner of the building.

00:17:02.605 --> 00:17:04.774 position:50% align:center
Must be mediums
of the operator.

00:17:04.858 --> 00:17:07.527 position:50% align:center
I'll have Jiji be the
first to remove one.

00:17:07.610 --> 00:17:10.363 position:50% align:center
Let's go ahead and surround
the others with talismans.

00:17:10.447 --> 00:17:11.406 position:50% align:center
[FINDER 3A]
Roger that.

[JIJI sneezes]

[REEVER]
Don't blow snot on it.

00:17:14.451 --> 00:17:16.828 position:50% align:center
A sealing barrier, my ass!

00:17:16.911 --> 00:17:19.205 position:50% align:center
This damn mystic nonsense.

[CAPTAIN GALMAR]
Huh? What the hell?

00:17:24.919 --> 00:17:26.212 position:50% align:center
[CAPTAIN GALMAR]
H-Hey!

00:17:26.296 --> 00:17:28.006 position:50% align:center
What happened?

00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:34.637 position:50% align:center
They're okay!

00:17:34.721 --> 00:17:36.222 position:50% align:center
Hey, Reever.

00:17:36.306 --> 00:17:39.017 position:50% align:center
You said those guys were
just regular bodyguards.

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:41.478 position:50% align:center
They seem like
they're anything but.

00:17:46.024 --> 00:17:47.650 position:50% align:center
[SKULL A]
It is a fact that only Akuma

00:17:47.734 --> 00:17:50.111 position:50% align:center
can pass through
the Hekiji Barrier.

00:17:50.195 --> 00:17:52.697 position:50% align:center
[SKULL B] The Order might have
something up their sleeve.

00:17:52.781 --> 00:17:55.158 position:50% align:center
We must report it to the Earl.

00:17:58.870 --> 00:18:00.205 position:50% align:center
Are you all right?

00:18:00.288 --> 00:18:02.082 position:50% align:center
Say something, Mother!

00:18:02.165 --> 00:18:03.249 position:50% align:center
Are you hurting?

Don't you worry,

I'm a whole lot
stronger than I look.

00:18:09.756 --> 00:18:11.800 position:50% align:center
Oh, Mother! [cries]

00:18:11.883 --> 00:18:13.718 position:50% align:center
Hey, this is nothing.

00:18:13.802 --> 00:18:15.512 position:50% align:center
[TIMOTHY]
Mother, your face is so hot!

00:18:15.595 --> 00:18:16.388 position:50% align:center

What?!

[CHILDREN cry]

00:18:17.847 --> 00:18:19.974 position:50% align:center
[REEVER] It's an aftereffect
from the Dark Matter!

00:18:20.058 --> 00:18:22.102 position:50% align:center
[JIJI] Are they sick from
being made into dolls?

00:18:22.185 --> 00:18:24.521 position:50% align:center
[FINDER 3A]
Get them to a hospital now!

00:18:25.814 --> 00:18:28.692 position:50% align:center
Back when I apprehended
Timothy's father,

00:18:28.775 --> 00:18:30.443 position:50% align:center
I charged him even
though I knew

00:18:30.527 --> 00:18:33.863 position:50% align:center
he had a child to look
after and support.

00:18:33.947 --> 00:18:36.574 position:50% align:center
Emilia was adamant
that we adopt him,

00:18:36.658 --> 00:18:40.120 position:50% align:center
but I was wracked with guilt
when I looked at him.

00:18:40.203 --> 00:18:44.541 position:50% align:center
I figured he must hate me, so
I took him to this orphanage.

00:18:44.624 --> 00:18:47.585 position:50% align:center
Is there any way you
can just let him be?

00:18:47.669 --> 00:18:49.754 position:50% align:center
And not take him with you?

00:18:49.838 --> 00:18:51.506 position:50% align:center
I give you my solemn word.

00:18:51.589 --> 00:18:55.051 position:50% align:center
I'll keep him safe from
Akuma from now on!

00:18:55.135 --> 00:18:56.302 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
No way.

00:18:56.386 --> 00:18:59.889 position:50% align:center
Uh! But, why?

00:18:59.973 --> 00:19:01.349 position:50% align:center
[TIMOTHY]
Won't you have to arrest me

00:19:01.433 --> 00:19:03.059 position:50% align:center
if I stick around, Galmar?

00:19:03.143 --> 00:19:05.353 position:50% align:center
[CAPTAIN GALMAR]
It's "Captain" Galmar!

00:19:05.437 --> 00:19:08.231 position:50% align:center
I can't arrest you, you're
just a child, you idiot!

00:19:08.314 --> 00:19:10.316 position:50% align:center
I'm starting to think
I should just leave.

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:12.235 position:50% align:center
--What?!
--But... Timothy.

00:19:12.318 --> 00:19:14.654 position:50% align:center
Well, Mother's gettin'
pretty old, y'know,

00:19:14.738 --> 00:19:17.240 position:50% align:center
and the rest of the kids
are all so little.

00:19:17.323 --> 00:19:20.702 position:50% align:center
All this Akuma stuff
is too much for them.

00:19:20.785 --> 00:19:23.997 position:50% align:center
You black clad agents
have got your way, I'll join.

00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:25.498 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:26.958 --> 00:19:28.960 position:50% align:center
My name is Timothy.

00:19:29.044 --> 00:19:32.339 position:50% align:center
Uh.

00:19:32.422 --> 00:19:34.466 position:50% align:center
Timothy Hearst.

00:19:34.549 --> 00:19:37.677 position:50% align:center
My Akuma-killing Innocence
is called Tsukikami,

00:19:37.761 --> 00:19:40.847 position:50% align:center
and I'll fight hard by
your side, Exorcists.

00:19:40.930 --> 00:19:45.185 position:50% align:center
But don't you all go thinking
that I'm gonna do it for free.

00:19:45.268 --> 00:19:47.604 position:50% align:center
[KOMUI] You're telling me we
have to pay for the damage

00:19:47.687 --> 00:19:49.481 position:50% align:center
caused by Phantom Thief G?

00:19:49.564 --> 00:19:51.816 position:50% align:center
[FEY] Thirty-seven stolen
items in total,

00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:54.819 position:50% align:center
and they're all very expensive.

00:19:54.903 --> 00:19:58.031 position:50% align:center
Plus, we need to pay
reparations to the 89 people

00:19:58.114 --> 00:19:59.532 position:50% align:center
who were falsely detained,

00:19:59.616 --> 00:20:02.911 position:50% align:center
and provide funding for the
Hearst Orphanage to reopen.

00:20:02.994 --> 00:20:05.205 position:50% align:center
When we tally up
the cost of everything...

00:20:05.288 --> 00:20:06.581 position:50% align:center
That's what we're looking at.

00:20:06.664 --> 00:20:08.792 position:50% align:center
[screams]

00:20:10.377 --> 00:20:12.212 position:50% align:center
[EMILIA]
Shouldn't you be back at work?

00:20:12.295 --> 00:20:14.589 position:50% align:center
I'm worried about you,
not my work.

00:20:14.673 --> 00:20:19.010 position:50% align:center
I took a paid leave of absence
until your injuries have healed.

00:20:19.094 --> 00:20:21.680 position:50% align:center
[EMILIA] I've decided to
join the Black Order.

00:20:21.763 --> 00:20:22.722 position:50% align:center
Huh?!

00:20:22.806 --> 00:20:24.265 position:50% align:center
Well, that way neither of us

00:20:24.349 --> 00:20:26.476 position:50% align:center
will have to worry
about Timothy.

00:20:26.559 --> 00:20:28.812 position:50% align:center
I'll be there right by his side!

00:20:28.895 --> 00:20:31.398 position:50% align:center
Hold on. You what...?

00:20:32.482 --> 00:20:34.275 position:50% align:center
[DIRECTOR 2A]
Matthew and Eva's temperatures

00:20:34.359 --> 00:20:37.153 position:50% align:center
finally settled down.
According to the doctor,

00:20:37.237 --> 00:20:40.865 position:50% align:center
everyone will make a full
recovery and be just fine.

00:20:40.949 --> 00:20:43.243 position:50% align:center
[TIMOTHY] I told them flat out
I wouldn't join them unless

00:20:43.326 --> 00:20:46.538 position:50% align:center
they made sure you guys got
the best medical help around.

00:20:46.621 --> 00:20:48.540 position:50% align:center
Oh, is that what
you told them?

00:20:48.623 --> 00:20:50.291 position:50% align:center
Flat out, huh?

00:20:50.375 --> 00:20:52.419 position:50% align:center
[TIMOTHY]
Yep! Flat out!

00:20:52.502 --> 00:20:54.504 position:50% align:center
Exorcists are important, y'know.

00:20:54.587 --> 00:20:56.548 position:50% align:center
Look at the cool
uniform I got!

00:20:56.631 --> 00:20:58.925 position:50% align:center
You could tell it must've
been expensive!

00:20:59.009 --> 00:21:02.012 position:50% align:center
They sent it to me,
so I figured I'd try it on.

00:21:02.095 --> 00:21:04.681 position:50% align:center
Oh, and I also heard that
they have super fancy food

00:21:04.764 --> 00:21:07.851 position:50% align:center
and you're allowed
to eat all you want!

00:21:07.934 --> 00:21:11.146 position:50% align:center
[DIRECTOR 2A sighs] First thing
tomorrow, we're leaving Paris.

00:21:11.229 --> 00:21:13.857 position:50% align:center
We'll be staying with
Father Federico in London

00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:16.609 position:50% align:center
until a decision is made
about our new house.

00:21:16.693 --> 00:21:19.612 position:50% align:center
They said it's safe there.

00:21:19.696 --> 00:21:21.322 position:50% align:center
[TIMOTHY]
Well, yeah.

00:21:21.406 --> 00:21:23.867 position:50% align:center
I requested that flat out, too.

00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:25.994 position:50% align:center
So of course it's safe.

00:21:26.077 --> 00:21:27.162 position:50% align:center
[DIRECTOR 2A sniffles]

00:21:27.245 --> 00:21:29.873 position:50% align:center
[TIMOTHY]
Your nose is running. Mother.

00:21:29.956 --> 00:21:31.875 position:50% align:center
Is it?

00:21:31.958 --> 00:21:35.462 position:50% align:center
[TIMOTHY]
Yeah... a lot.

00:21:35.545 --> 00:21:37.547 position:50% align:center
It's gushing.

00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:41.843 position:50% align:center
[DIRECTOR 2A] It'll be just
fine once I wash my face.

00:21:41.926 --> 00:21:43.762 position:50% align:center
[TIMOTHY]
Yeah.

00:21:43.845 --> 00:21:46.139 position:50% align:center
[ALLEN]
The Director can be a bit silly.

00:21:46.222 --> 00:21:49.642 position:50% align:center
That side of her... kind
of reminds me of Mana.

00:21:49.726 --> 00:21:50.518 position:50% align:center
[LINK]
Hm?

00:21:50.602 --> 00:21:51.728 position:50% align:center
And Timothy?

00:21:51.811 --> 00:21:54.189 position:50% align:center
He's just like me
when I was a kid.

00:21:54.272 --> 00:21:55.899 position:50% align:center
So I get how he feels.

00:21:55.982 --> 00:21:57.984 position:50% align:center
What he's going through.

00:21:58.068 --> 00:22:01.112 position:50% align:center
You know, you've never spoken
to me about that before.

00:22:01.196 --> 00:22:02.906 position:50% align:center
About Mana, I mean.

00:22:02.989 --> 00:22:04.699 position:50% align:center
What?

00:22:04.783 --> 00:22:06.743 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I guess you're right.

00:22:09.913 --> 00:22:14.376 position:50% align:center
[ALLEN] So I can finally talk
about him without feeling pain.

00:22:14.459 --> 00:22:17.128 position:50% align:center
You're basically my shadow
now, I hardly notice you.

00:22:17.212 --> 00:22:18.755 position:50% align:center
Hold on, your shadow?!

00:22:18.838 --> 00:22:21.132 position:50% align:center
[ALLEN]
Ha- Ow, laughing hurts.

00:23:43.256 --> 00:23:44.591 position:50% align:center
[KANDA]
Soon after leaving Paris

00:23:44.674 --> 00:23:46.384 position:50% align:center
and returning to the
Order's Headquarters,

00:23:46.468 --> 00:23:49.596 position:50% align:center
a horde of Akuma have
appeared across the world.

00:23:49.679 --> 00:23:51.264 position:50% align:center
The Noah Clan.

00:23:51.348 --> 00:23:53.391 position:50% align:center
What the hell are
they up to now?

00:23:53.475 --> 00:23:56.936 position:50% align:center
Next time, Night 4:
"Blood Crusade."
