00:16:50.885 --> 00:16:51.678 position:50% align:center
[AKUMA'S SOUL]
He...

00:16:51.761 --> 00:16:53.054 position:50% align:center
Help...

00:16:53.138 --> 00:16:55.098 position:50% align:center
...us.

00:16:55.181 --> 00:16:56.516 position:50% align:center
[ALLEN]
They're all gone.

00:16:56.599 --> 00:16:58.560 position:50% align:center
He swallowed them, too.

00:17:00.895 --> 00:17:02.188 position:50% align:center
[TOKUSA]
Oh, no.

00:17:02.272 --> 00:17:04.733 position:50% align:center
Did those poor, sad
Akuma souls suffer?

00:17:04.816 --> 00:17:06.234 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:06.317 --> 00:17:09.195 position:50% align:center
[TOKUSA] I wish I had your
ability to see that for myself.

00:17:09.279 --> 00:17:10.196 position:50% align:center
What was that?

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:11.948 position:50% align:center
Sorry, did I upset you?

00:17:12.032 --> 00:17:13.324 position:50% align:center
This sympathy of yours.

00:17:13.408 --> 00:17:15.201 position:50% align:center
I can't help but find it annoy--

00:17:15.285 --> 00:17:17.495 position:50% align:center
I mean. Well, the thing is...

00:17:17.579 --> 00:17:20.165 position:50% align:center
I actually enjoy
destroying Akuma.

00:17:20.248 --> 00:17:21.708 position:50% align:center
[ALLEN grunts]

00:17:21.791 --> 00:17:25.337 position:50% align:center
Not only do I get to use my
powers to help save humanity,

00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:28.340 position:50% align:center
it allows me to provide
sustenance for God.

00:17:28.423 --> 00:17:31.468 position:50% align:center
And that fills my soul with
an enormous sense of joy.

00:17:31.551 --> 00:17:33.345 position:50% align:center
That must be nice for you.

00:17:33.428 --> 00:17:34.554 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:37.474 --> 00:17:38.391 position:50% align:center
[MADARAO grunts]

00:17:38.475 --> 00:17:39.934 position:50% align:center
Good to see you.

00:17:40.018 --> 00:17:41.686 position:50% align:center
Long time, huh?

00:17:45.982 --> 00:17:48.318 position:50% align:center
[MARIE]
Lavi! What's wrong?

00:17:48.401 --> 00:17:50.904 position:50% align:center
[LAVI]
Well, we've got company.

00:17:50.987 --> 00:17:52.572 position:50% align:center
They're here.

00:17:59.204 --> 00:18:00.705 position:50% align:center
Noah...

00:18:00.789 --> 00:18:03.541 position:50% align:center
[TYKI] We're not here
on serious business.

00:18:03.625 --> 00:18:06.127 position:50% align:center
Just having some fun
hunting Exorcists.

00:18:06.211 --> 00:18:09.130 position:50% align:center
[TYKI chuckles]

00:18:09.214 --> 00:18:10.548 position:50% align:center
Tyki!

00:18:12.175 --> 00:18:14.594 position:50% align:center
You evil bastards!

00:18:16.596 --> 00:18:19.683 position:50% align:center

Walker!

00:18:21.142 --> 00:18:23.395 position:50% align:center
Call out to me, Walker!

00:18:23.478 --> 00:18:26.481 position:50% align:center
Where are you? Say something!

00:18:27.774 --> 00:18:30.902 position:50% align:center
[LINK] Madarao and Tokusa
aren't responding, either.

00:18:30.985 --> 00:18:32.904 position:50% align:center
What the hell is happening?

00:18:32.987 --> 00:18:36.282 position:50% align:center
[TOKUSA whimpering]

00:18:36.366 --> 00:18:37.242 position:50% align:center
[ALLEN]
Are you okay?

00:18:37.325 --> 00:18:38.827 position:50% align:center
[TOKUSA]
Don't touch me!

00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:40.537 position:50% align:center
[groans] Dammit.

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:43.707 position:50% align:center
I can't believe we ran
with the Noah right there.

00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:46.543 position:50% align:center
[ALLEN] Tyki said that they
were hunting Exorcists.

00:18:46.626 --> 00:18:49.045 position:50% align:center
That would explain
all of the Akuma.

00:18:49.129 --> 00:18:51.047 position:50% align:center
We need to get back to the camp.

00:18:51.131 --> 00:18:52.799 position:50% align:center
He needs to be treated.

00:18:52.882 --> 00:18:54.592 position:50% align:center
[MADARAO]
Leave him be.

00:18:54.676 --> 00:18:57.053 position:50% align:center
His wounds have already closed.

00:18:57.512 --> 00:18:59.806 position:50% align:center
[ALLEN gasps]
Amazing.

00:18:59.889 --> 00:19:02.308 position:50% align:center
You have the same
healing powers as Kanda.

00:19:02.392 --> 00:19:05.103 position:50% align:center
Oh, is that a fact?

00:19:05.186 --> 00:19:08.273 position:50% align:center
Hang on just a minute.
I almost forgot.

00:19:08.356 --> 00:19:10.859 position:50% align:center
He and Alma Karma.

00:19:10.942 --> 00:19:14.070 position:50% align:center
My healing power only
closes up the wounds.

00:19:14.154 --> 00:19:17.866 position:50% align:center
It's nice and all, but it's not
as good as the Second's power.

00:19:17.949 --> 00:19:21.036 position:50% align:center
[ALLEN]
Alma? The Second?

00:19:21.119 --> 00:19:22.412 position:50% align:center
[TOKUSA]
Madarao.

00:19:22.495 --> 00:19:24.122 position:50% align:center
I'm ready now.

00:19:28.835 --> 00:19:30.503 position:50% align:center
[ALLEN]
Wait, what're you doing?

00:19:30.587 --> 00:19:32.339 position:50% align:center
I'm going to absorb his body.

00:19:32.422 --> 00:19:34.174 position:50% align:center
Absorb him?

00:19:34.257 --> 00:19:37.177 position:50% align:center
[gasps] But... He's your friend!

00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:40.430 position:50% align:center
[MADARAO] His wounds have
robbed him of his Akuma power.

00:19:40.513 --> 00:19:43.224 position:50% align:center
There's no point in
him continuing to live.

00:19:43.308 --> 00:19:44.768 position:50% align:center
So I'll absorb him.

00:19:44.851 --> 00:19:48.605 position:50% align:center
And I'll take in the
Alma cells from his body.

00:19:48.688 --> 00:19:51.107 position:50% align:center
Wait, what?! That's just insane!

00:19:51.191 --> 00:19:54.027 position:50% align:center
And what the hell is this Alma
stuff you're talking about?

00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:56.654 position:50% align:center
Alma Karma.

00:19:56.738 --> 00:19:59.324 position:50% align:center
The first human-Akuma parent.

00:19:59.407 --> 00:20:02.410 position:50% align:center
The first to merge with the
nucleus of an Akuma egg.

00:20:02.494 --> 00:20:04.579 position:50% align:center
We're created from his cells.

00:20:04.662 --> 00:20:08.625 position:50% align:center
Ever since we absorbed
the Alma cells, we accepted

00:20:08.708 --> 00:20:11.628 position:50% align:center
that we would one day become
parent bodies ourselves.

00:20:11.711 --> 00:20:14.047 position:50% align:center
Parent... bodies?

00:20:14.130 --> 00:20:15.674 position:50% align:center
[MADARAO]
The Alma cells within us

00:20:15.757 --> 00:20:19.427 position:50% align:center
continue to multiply when
they absorb Akuma.

00:20:19.511 --> 00:20:22.597 position:50% align:center
We're offered to God when
we become parent bodies.

00:20:22.681 --> 00:20:25.934 position:50% align:center
And our cells will be used
to create new thirds.

00:20:26.017 --> 00:20:28.978 position:50% align:center
Our anti-Akuma strength
grows with each generation,

00:20:29.062 --> 00:20:32.691 position:50% align:center
ensuring our odds of
helping to save the world.

00:20:32.774 --> 00:20:33.942 position:50% align:center
And that

00:20:34.025 --> 00:20:37.362 position:50% align:center
Is the purpose of the
Third Exorcist program.

00:20:37.445 --> 00:20:40.532 position:50% align:center
So they can keep turning
humans into half-Akuma?

00:20:40.615 --> 00:20:42.033 position:50% align:center
[MADARAO]
There's no way of knowing when

00:20:42.117 --> 00:20:44.661 position:50% align:center
a new Innocence
Accommodator will appear.

00:20:44.744 --> 00:20:47.580 position:50% align:center
And the Order doesn't have
time to sit around waiting.

00:20:47.664 --> 00:20:48.707 position:50% align:center
They need us.

00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:50.291 position:50% align:center
But... It's just...

00:20:50.375 --> 00:20:53.837 position:50% align:center
[TOKUSA] Look, we don't
expect you to understand.

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:56.089 position:50% align:center
You all had it so easy.

00:20:56.172 --> 00:21:00.176 position:50% align:center
The Innocence simply chose
you to become Exorcists.

00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:02.512 position:50% align:center
But our desire
to save the world--

00:21:02.595 --> 00:21:05.557 position:50% align:center
it's the only real
reason we have to live.

00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:07.934 position:50% align:center
So I'm asking you
not to interfere!

00:21:08.018 --> 00:21:08.852 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:08.935 --> 00:21:10.729 position:50% align:center
[TOKUSA]
This is my last wish.

00:21:10.812 --> 00:21:14.107 position:50% align:center
To be absorbed and to
become part of Madarao.

00:21:14.190 --> 00:21:17.819 position:50% align:center
I refuse to have my life taken
from me by the hands of a Noah!

00:21:17.902 --> 00:21:20.238 position:50% align:center
[ALLEN gasping]

00:21:20.321 --> 00:21:23.366 position:50% align:center
[SHERYL]
Don't get so worked up.

00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:26.661 position:50% align:center
Despite what you've heard,
we're not the ones to fear.

00:21:26.745 --> 00:21:28.496 position:50% align:center
We're not the real enemy.

00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:30.206 position:50% align:center
Tokusa!

00:21:30.290 --> 00:21:31.082 position:50% align:center

[MADARAO groans]

00:21:33.376 --> 00:21:35.587 position:50% align:center
I'd be happy to
tell you, though.

00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:37.339 position:50% align:center
Do you wanna know
the name of the one

00:21:37.422 --> 00:21:39.341 position:50% align:center
you should really be scared of?

00:21:39.424 --> 00:21:41.301 position:50% align:center

00:21:48.767 --> 00:21:51.644 position:50% align:center
[WISELY]
You're Yu Kanda. Correct?

00:21:51.728 --> 00:21:52.687 position:50% align:center
That's right.

00:21:52.771 --> 00:21:54.147 position:50% align:center
Who the hell're you?

00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:55.523 position:50% align:center
Tell me something.

00:21:55.607 --> 00:21:58.026 position:50% align:center
Does the name "Alma"
mean anything to you?

00:21:58.109 --> 00:21:58.943 position:50% align:center
[KANDA gasping]

00:21:59.027 --> 00:22:00.904 position:50% align:center
[WISELY]
Oh, it does.

00:22:00.987 --> 00:22:02.781 position:50% align:center
That's certainly helpful.

00:22:02.864 --> 00:22:04.032 position:50% align:center
We're throwin' a little party,

00:22:04.115 --> 00:22:06.201 position:50% align:center
y'see, and we could
use your brain.

00:22:08.661 --> 00:22:09.788 position:50% align:center

00:22:11.081 --> 00:22:14.042 position:50% align:center
[CHILD]
I have faith...

00:22:14.125 --> 00:22:18.129 position:50% align:center
When this holy
war is finally over.

00:22:18.213 --> 00:22:20.423 position:50% align:center
The world will be free.

00:22:20.507 --> 00:22:22.467 position:50% align:center
Free of evil.

00:23:43.256 --> 00:23:45.175 position:50% align:center
[WISELY] Under the guidance
of Lord Millennium,

00:23:45.258 --> 00:23:46.676 position:50% align:center
our plans to finally end

00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:49.804 position:50% align:center
the battle against Innocence
are well under way.

00:23:49.888 --> 00:23:52.098 position:50% align:center
We'll reveal the "love"
and "tragedy"

00:23:52.182 --> 00:23:53.850 position:50% align:center
the Order's hidden from you.

00:23:53.933 --> 00:23:57.395 position:50% align:center
Next time, Night 5:
"Alma Karma."
