[COMMUNICATION STAFF A] Exorcist
and CROW units, begin pursuit.

00:00:12.053 --> 00:00:13.930 position:50% align:center
We should lock down
and secure Headquarters.

00:00:14.014 --> 00:00:15.140 position:50% align:center
[MAN B]
Right.

00:00:15.223 --> 00:00:17.684 position:50% align:center
We can't be too safe
until Walker's caught.

00:00:17.767 --> 00:00:19.644 position:50% align:center
We have only one priority.

00:00:19.728 --> 00:00:22.313 position:50% align:center
And that is to
apprehend Allen Walker.

00:00:22.397 --> 00:00:23.940 position:50% align:center
Disregard the Noahs.

00:00:24.024 --> 00:00:25.608 position:50% align:center
Focus on finding Walker.

00:00:25.692 --> 00:00:27.986 position:50% align:center
Then surround him
with a barrier.

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:31.114 position:50% align:center
Do not let him
leave this island!

[JIJI]
I saw it happen!

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:34.367 position:50% align:center
There was an explosion
in the dungeon!

00:00:34.451 --> 00:00:37.120 position:50% align:center
A-And Timcanpy
flew out with a Noah!

00:00:37.203 --> 00:00:38.496 position:50% align:center
They just came blasting out!

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:39.748 position:50% align:center
And then Allen and a second Noah

00:00:39.831 --> 00:00:42.292 position:50% align:center
came crawling out
of Tim's mouth!

00:00:42.375 --> 00:00:43.084 position:50% align:center
Dammit!

00:00:43.168 --> 00:00:45.253 position:50% align:center
I'm freakin' out here!

00:00:45.337 --> 00:00:46.963 position:50% align:center
[LAB MEMBER A]
Allen left with Noahs?

00:00:47.047 --> 00:00:48.423 position:50% align:center
That can't be right.

00:00:48.506 --> 00:00:49.424 position:50% align:center
Oh, come on!

00:00:49.507 --> 00:00:50.675 position:50% align:center
I bet he's finally fed up

00:00:50.759 --> 00:00:52.552 position:50% align:center
with the crap the
Order's put him through.

You don't know Allen!

00:00:54.095 --> 00:00:55.013 position:50% align:center
He's not like that!

00:00:55.096 --> 00:00:57.557 position:50% align:center
Yeah? Why'd he
escape with Noahs?

00:01:01.853 --> 00:01:02.979 position:50% align:center
You okay, Johnny?

00:01:03.063 --> 00:01:05.732 position:50% align:center
Yeah, hey!
Why don't you back me up here?

00:01:07.942 --> 00:01:09.903 position:50% align:center
[JOHNNY]
How?

00:01:09.986 --> 00:01:12.906 position:50% align:center
How is this even happening?

hell happened down here?

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:12.484 position:50% align:center
[ORDER STAFF B] Well,
something managed to knock out

00:03:12.567 --> 00:03:13.693 position:50% align:center
all of the guards.

00:03:13.777 --> 00:03:15.612 position:50% align:center

[ORDER STAFF C] The cell
is still filled with smoke,

00:03:20.325 --> 00:03:23.286 position:50% align:center
and we're not sure if
it's safe to enter yet.

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:24.079 position:50% align:center
Director!

00:03:24.162 --> 00:03:26.039 position:50% align:center

Inspector Link!

00:03:42.138 --> 00:03:43.515 position:50% align:center
Speak to me!

00:04:00.532 --> 00:04:05.578 position:50% align:center
Defiance is a repugnant
trait in a subordinate, Lvellie.

00:04:05.662 --> 00:04:07.706 position:50% align:center
He wasted my time.

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:10.625 position:50% align:center
And now I must hurry
in order to save Allen.

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.968 position:50% align:center

What?

00:04:20.051 --> 00:04:20.802 position:50% align:center

Leave now!

That's an order.

[ORDER STAFF A]
But, Director?

00:04:23.638 --> 00:04:26.349 position:50% align:center
[LVELLIE] You'll only find the
body of Howard Link in here.

00:04:26.433 --> 00:04:30.103 position:50% align:center
You are to report his death and
seal off this area, posthaste.

Yes, Director!

It revealed itself, didn't it?

00:04:43.324 --> 00:04:45.952 position:50% align:center
[LVELLIE] I'm afraid
that it most likely did.

00:04:46.036 --> 00:04:48.329 position:50% align:center
Be careful, Renny. Please.

00:04:50.665 --> 00:04:52.125 position:50% align:center
Renny?

Malcolm.

00:04:59.549 --> 00:05:02.093 position:50% align:center
Just what exactly
are you plotting?

00:05:02.177 --> 00:05:04.304 position:50% align:center
You've been acting
strangely ever since

00:05:04.387 --> 00:05:07.390 position:50% align:center
you formally initiated
the Third Exorcist Plan.

00:05:07.474 --> 00:05:09.768 position:50% align:center
Reinforcement was
the official reason.

00:05:09.851 --> 00:05:12.062 position:50% align:center
But you had an entirely
different goal in mind,

00:05:12.145 --> 00:05:13.730 position:50% align:center
didn't you?

00:05:16.775 --> 00:05:19.527 position:50% align:center
[ZU] Just how many people
are you willing to sacrifice

00:05:19.611 --> 00:05:21.696 position:50% align:center

00:05:42.008 --> 00:05:44.302 position:50% align:center
Enough with the
macho head games!

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:51.059 position:50% align:center
So this is the Black Order.

00:05:51.142 --> 00:05:52.394 position:50% align:center
If they're not on assignments,

00:05:52.477 --> 00:05:55.105 position:50% align:center
this is where the
Exorcists spend all their time.

00:05:55.188 --> 00:05:56.356 position:50% align:center
In fact, most of them

00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:58.650 position:50% align:center
start calling our
Headquarters their home.

00:05:58.733 --> 00:05:59.901 position:50% align:center
That's nice.

00:05:59.984 --> 00:06:01.945 position:50% align:center
Just like a family.

00:06:04.572 --> 00:06:06.116 position:50% align:center
[LENALEE]

00:06:10.704 --> 00:06:12.163 position:50% align:center
All right, this is far enough.

00:06:12.247 --> 00:06:14.040 position:50% align:center
We should be safe for now.

00:06:14.124 --> 00:06:15.667 position:50% align:center
So then,

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:19.337 position:50% align:center
I guess it's time to worry
about why she's not waking up.

00:06:19.421 --> 00:06:20.588 position:50% align:center
What's going on?

00:06:20.672 --> 00:06:23.174 position:50% align:center
You said that Innocence
doesn't work on Road.

00:06:23.258 --> 00:06:25.510 position:50% align:center
Hey, I'm just as
confused as you.

00:06:25.593 --> 00:06:27.679 position:50% align:center
All I can figure is that
he might've damaged

00:06:27.762 --> 00:06:29.389 position:50% align:center
her Noah memories somehow.

00:06:29.472 --> 00:06:30.765 position:50% align:center
Huh?!

00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:32.976 position:50% align:center
Apocryphos is clearly different.

00:06:33.059 --> 00:06:36.813 position:50% align:center
He is far more powerful than the
Innocence you Accommodators use.

00:06:39.524 --> 00:06:41.776 position:50% align:center
Did you really believe
that you could harm me

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:43.653 position:50% align:center
with your Innocence?

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:47.365 position:50% align:center
Oh, Link.

00:06:47.449 --> 00:06:49.659 position:50% align:center
We can't even
use Road's door now.

00:06:49.743 --> 00:06:51.036 position:50% align:center
Damn.

00:06:51.119 --> 00:06:52.746 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:06:52.829 --> 00:06:54.664 position:50% align:center
We're being followed.

00:06:54.748 --> 00:06:56.833 position:50% align:center
I can feel it.

00:06:56.916 --> 00:06:59.878 position:50% align:center
Looks like I might've been wrong
when I said we were safe here.

00:06:59.961 --> 00:07:02.547 position:50% align:center
I got enough info on
Apocryphos for the time being,

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:05.091 position:50% align:center
so I suggest we move.

00:07:05.175 --> 00:07:07.927 position:50% align:center
Lord Millennium will
realize what's going on soon.

00:07:08.011 --> 00:07:09.429 position:50% align:center
Once he does,

00:07:09.512 --> 00:07:11.973 position:50% align:center
he'll open an Ark gate somewhere
conspicuous on the island.

00:07:12.057 --> 00:07:14.309 position:50% align:center
But until then, you take Road.

00:07:14.392 --> 00:07:16.394 position:50% align:center
Are you out of your mind?

00:07:16.478 --> 00:07:18.063 position:50% align:center
There's no way!

00:07:18.146 --> 00:07:20.023 position:50% align:center
Hey, I've been
dragging this fat Golem

00:07:20.106 --> 00:07:22.359 position:50% align:center
all over the place while
keeping your ass alive.

00:07:22.442 --> 00:07:23.818 position:50% align:center
That's not what I meant!

00:07:23.902 --> 00:07:25.653 position:50% align:center
I am still an Exorcist!

00:07:25.737 --> 00:07:27.697 position:50% align:center
Why would I escape with Noah?

00:07:27.781 --> 00:07:29.366 position:50% align:center
Ah! It's your fault.

00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:32.702 position:50% align:center
You're the ones who complicated
everything in the first place!

00:07:32.786 --> 00:07:34.621 position:50% align:center
So go ahead if you wanna run!

00:07:34.704 --> 00:07:37.374 position:50% align:center
But Tim and I are
going back to the Or--

00:07:37.457 --> 00:07:41.294 position:50% align:center

00:07:41.378 --> 00:07:42.504 position:50% align:center
Whoa, hey!

What're you doing, you idiot?

00:07:43.922 --> 00:07:44.714 position:50% align:center
Stop that!

00:07:44.798 --> 00:07:46.007 position:50% align:center

00:07:46.091 --> 00:07:47.467 position:50% align:center
Don't touch me!

00:07:51.179 --> 00:07:53.098 position:50% align:center
It activated on it's own!

00:07:53.181 --> 00:07:54.724 position:50% align:center
I can't stop it!

00:07:57.519 --> 00:08:00.814 position:50% align:center

There you are, Allen.

00:08:05.068 --> 00:08:08.238 position:50% align:center

I'm gonna cut it off for you.

00:08:16.121 --> 00:08:17.789 position:50% align:center
Stop it!

00:08:20.208 --> 00:08:21.209 position:50% align:center
Really?

00:08:21.292 --> 00:08:23.712 position:50% align:center
You're gonna try
to fight me on this one?

00:08:27.882 --> 00:08:30.427 position:50% align:center
Don't tell me you still
wanna keep that thing.

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:32.345 position:50% align:center
Just stay away from me!

00:08:32.429 --> 00:08:33.763 position:50% align:center
Are you stupid?

00:08:33.847 --> 00:08:35.390 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:08:35.473 --> 00:08:37.434 position:50% align:center
[JOYD]
Apocryphos.

00:08:37.517 --> 00:08:39.769 position:50% align:center
An autonomous form
of Innocence that exists

00:08:39.853 --> 00:08:42.522 position:50% align:center
to protect the Heart.

00:08:42.605 --> 00:08:46.151 position:50% align:center
But did that thing look like the
pure Innocence of God to you?

00:08:46.234 --> 00:08:48.069 position:50% align:center
That savage monster?

00:08:48.153 --> 00:08:49.904 position:50% align:center
And that's coming from you?

00:08:49.988 --> 00:08:52.032 position:50% align:center
He's no worse than the Noah!

00:08:52.115 --> 00:08:55.160 position:50% align:center
At least he doesn't create
Akuma and kill people!

00:08:55.243 --> 00:08:56.953 position:50% align:center
You're the real monsters!

00:08:57.037 --> 00:08:59.330 position:50% align:center
Irony is lost on you, isn't it?

00:08:59.414 --> 00:09:00.457 position:50% align:center
What's that?

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:01.708 position:50% align:center
Hate to tell you,

00:09:01.791 --> 00:09:04.127 position:50% align:center
but you've already got
two monsters inside you.

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:07.839 position:50% align:center
The oh-so-heinous Noah
Memory and your Innocence.

00:09:07.922 --> 00:09:09.924 position:50% align:center
The Millennium Earl
and the Noah.

00:09:10.008 --> 00:09:13.762 position:50% align:center
We fight to cleanse the world of
Innocence and destroy the Heart.

00:09:13.845 --> 00:09:15.764 position:50% align:center
That's who we are.

00:09:15.847 --> 00:09:19.976 position:50% align:center
But the Exorcists, their one
concern is to defeat us.

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:21.353 position:50% align:center
And then there's Apocryphos,

00:09:21.436 --> 00:09:24.230 position:50% align:center
who only lives
only to guard the Heart.

00:09:24.314 --> 00:09:26.107 position:50% align:center
All of these warring factions--

00:09:26.191 --> 00:09:28.485 position:50% align:center
you can split them
up into black or white.

00:09:28.568 --> 00:09:31.279 position:50% align:center
Dark Matter or Innocence.

00:09:32.447 --> 00:09:33.865 position:50% align:center
Except.

00:09:33.948 --> 00:09:35.408 position:50% align:center
Where do you fall, boy?

00:09:35.492 --> 00:09:37.285 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:09:37.369 --> 00:09:39.704 position:50% align:center
[JOYD] Most of the Exorcists
see you as a Noah.

Their natural enemy.

00:09:42.749 --> 00:09:46.461 position:50% align:center
But you've still managed
to keep the Fourteenth at bay.

00:09:46.544 --> 00:09:48.004 position:50% align:center
Regardless.

00:09:48.088 --> 00:09:51.591 position:50% align:center
Lord Millennium is damn near
delirious to stand by your side.

00:09:51.675 --> 00:09:54.177 position:50% align:center
And on top of that,
there's still a good chance

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:57.263 position:50% align:center
you might become one
with that Apocry-creep.

00:09:57.347 --> 00:09:59.140 position:50% align:center
So tell me, boy.

00:09:59.224 --> 00:10:02.143 position:50% align:center
Do you even know
which side you're really on?

00:10:02.227 --> 00:10:04.396 position:50% align:center
What? Th-That's...

00:10:04.479 --> 00:10:07.023 position:50% align:center
What's worse is you have
no idea what you are

00:10:07.107 --> 00:10:09.025 position:50% align:center
nor do you care.

00:10:09.109 --> 00:10:12.904 position:50% align:center
All you do is spread
confusion and conflict.

00:10:12.987 --> 00:10:16.241 position:50% align:center
It seems to me like
you're the worst of us all,

Are the Noah attacking?

00:10:51.735 --> 00:10:53.403 position:50% align:center
No. It's not that.

Tha-That kind of attack is...

00:11:07.417 --> 00:11:09.044 position:50% align:center
What? Look up there!

to help Allen Walker
escape, huh?

00:11:30.398 --> 00:11:32.150 position:50% align:center

I'm sure we can take him

just not feeling like himself.

hurting himself.

Huh?

00:18:45.166 --> 00:18:46.167 position:50% align:center
[JOYD]
You need to settle things

00:18:46.251 --> 00:18:49.379 position:50% align:center
with the monster inside
you on your own.

00:18:49.462 --> 00:18:51.339 position:50% align:center
Because the way
you are right now,

00:18:51.423 --> 00:18:54.467 position:50% align:center
you wouldn't be any
fun to play poker with.

00:19:00.682 --> 00:19:03.268 position:50% align:center
[ALLEN]
Settle things, huh?

00:19:04.477 --> 00:19:07.063 position:50% align:center
I don't even know
where I belong.

00:19:07.147 --> 00:19:09.190 position:50% align:center
Or what I am.

00:19:09.274 --> 00:19:12.986 position:50% align:center
I only spread
confusion and conflict.

00:19:13.069 --> 00:19:15.655 position:50% align:center
I'm so uncertain
about everything.

00:19:15.739 --> 00:19:18.783 position:50% align:center
He was right about all of it.

00:19:18.867 --> 00:19:20.410 position:50% align:center
Ugh.

00:19:20.493 --> 00:19:23.329 position:50% align:center
I really am the worst.

00:19:28.043 --> 00:19:31.338 position:50% align:center
[ROAD] "Never stop.
Always keep walking."

00:19:31.421 --> 00:19:33.048 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:33.131 --> 00:19:35.675 position:50% align:center
Nea left those words for Mana.

00:19:35.759 --> 00:19:36.718 position:50% align:center
[ALLEN]
Road!

00:19:36.801 --> 00:19:38.053 position:50% align:center
You're awake.

00:19:38.136 --> 00:19:39.596 position:50% align:center
Nea.

00:19:39.679 --> 00:19:43.266 position:50% align:center
He spent his life
fighting for Mana.

00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:48.313 position:50% align:center
But that's supposed
to be a secret.

00:19:48.396 --> 00:19:50.315 position:50% align:center
[ALLEN]
Road!

00:19:57.906 --> 00:19:59.616 position:50% align:center
Never stop.

00:19:59.699 --> 00:20:01.910 position:50% align:center
Always keep walking.

00:20:04.704 --> 00:20:06.247 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, Tim.

00:20:06.331 --> 00:20:09.125 position:50% align:center
But I can't take you with me.

00:20:09.209 --> 00:20:13.088 position:50% align:center
As big as you are right now,
well, you'll just stand out.

00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:16.549 position:50% align:center
What the?

00:20:16.633 --> 00:20:18.468 position:50% align:center
You're small again!

00:20:18.551 --> 00:20:20.720 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]
Y'know what?

00:20:20.804 --> 00:20:22.847 position:50% align:center
You really are a strange one.

00:20:28.353 --> 00:20:30.689 position:50% align:center
This is the last time
I'll rely on it.

00:20:30.772 --> 00:20:32.482 position:50% align:center
[ALLEN]
No more Ark.

00:20:34.401 --> 00:20:35.318 position:50% align:center
Never again.

00:20:35.402 --> 00:20:36.903 position:50% align:center
Not for the Noah.

00:20:36.986 --> 00:20:38.947 position:50% align:center
Or the Order.

00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:43.576 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:45.161 --> 00:20:48.873 position:50% align:center
[pants]

00:20:48.957 --> 00:20:50.375 position:50% align:center
Lenalee.

00:20:56.006 --> 00:20:58.425 position:50% align:center
[LENALEE]
Where are you going, Allen?

00:20:58.508 --> 00:20:59.467 position:50% align:center
You know that
you're not supposed

00:20:59.551 --> 00:21:03.304 position:50% align:center
to use the Ark
without permission.

00:21:03.388 --> 00:21:05.640 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I remember.

00:21:05.724 --> 00:21:07.475 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:21:07.559 --> 00:21:09.602 position:50% align:center
Why, Allen?

00:21:11.730 --> 00:21:13.398 position:50% align:center
If you run away like this,

00:21:13.481 --> 00:21:16.151 position:50% align:center
then we'll have to
consider you our enemy!

00:21:16.234 --> 00:21:17.152 position:50% align:center
True.

00:21:17.235 --> 00:21:18.361 position:50% align:center
But don't worry.

00:21:18.445 --> 00:21:20.321 position:50% align:center
I'm not really a match
for you in a fight.

00:21:20.405 --> 00:21:23.199 position:50% align:center
This is not a joke!

00:21:23.283 --> 00:21:25.702 position:50% align:center
I couldn't... I couldn't...

00:21:25.785 --> 00:21:28.038 position:50% align:center
I will never fight you!

00:21:31.207 --> 00:21:32.417 position:50% align:center
[ALLEN]
Whatever happens,

00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:34.502 position:50% align:center
I'll always be an Exorcist.

00:21:34.586 --> 00:21:36.713 position:50% align:center
Whichever path I wind up on,

00:21:36.796 --> 00:21:39.632 position:50% align:center
that fact will never change.

00:21:39.716 --> 00:21:41.468 position:50% align:center
Allen.

00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:45.764 position:50% align:center
[ALLEN]
I love the Order.

00:21:45.847 --> 00:21:47.807 position:50% align:center
It's where all
of my friends are.

00:21:50.393 --> 00:21:52.729 position:50% align:center
[ALLEN]
The Order is my home.

00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:02.238 position:50% align:center
And it always will be.

00:22:02.322 --> 00:22:03.490 position:50% align:center
Allen.

00:22:03.573 --> 00:22:05.825 position:50% align:center
Please.

00:22:20.799 --> 00:22:23.802 position:50% align:center
Allen!

00:23:43.506 --> 00:23:45.175 position:50% align:center
[ALLEN]
Shortly after Mana died.

00:23:45.258 --> 00:23:47.344 position:50% align:center
I was taken in by my master.

00:23:47.427 --> 00:23:48.803 position:50% align:center
That time in my life.

00:23:48.887 --> 00:23:50.638 position:50% align:center
I was lost in my own mind.

00:23:50.722 --> 00:23:52.891 position:50% align:center
And Mana's words
were all I had left.

00:23:54.017 --> 00:23:56.770 position:50% align:center
Next time,
the Final Night: "Walker."
