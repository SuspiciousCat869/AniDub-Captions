Uh?! What the hell,
we fell asleep?!

Uh! General!

General Cross.
May I come in, sir?

General Cross...?

--Wha...?

00:00:47.797 --> 00:00:49.966 position:50% align:center
Get Director Lvellie

Okay!

[ALLEN] Tim flew in
here so I... followed...

00:01:37.764 --> 00:01:41.059 position:50% align:center
Is that... blood?

00:01:42.602 --> 00:01:44.396 position:50% align:center
[ALLEN]
Whose blood...?

00:01:47.107 --> 00:01:49.109 position:50% align:center
[ALLEN gasping]

00:03:23.286 --> 00:03:26.539 position:50% align:center
[CROSS]
So, Allen,

00:03:26.623 --> 00:03:33.213 position:50% align:center
I've already told Tim to do as
he pleases while in your care.

00:03:33.296 --> 00:03:35.757 position:50% align:center
I'm sure you're reluctant to
listen to me now that you know

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.552 position:50% align:center
I've been following the wishes
of the Fourteenth all this time.

00:03:39.636 --> 00:03:40.929 position:50% align:center
But if you think that
you've been forced

00:03:41.012 --> 00:03:43.765 position:50% align:center
to walk a certain path
by either of us...

00:03:43.848 --> 00:03:46.393 position:50% align:center
Well, you need to know
that you're mistaken.

00:03:46.476 --> 00:03:49.270 position:50% align:center
A path forms behind
you as you walk.

00:03:49.354 --> 00:03:51.564 position:50% align:center
The soil you step
on is compressed,

00:03:51.648 --> 00:03:54.067 position:50% align:center
leaving an imprint of
the course you've chosen.

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.487 position:50% align:center
You are the only one who can
create your own path, Allen.

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.072 position:50% align:center
So trust me, here.

00:03:59.155 --> 00:04:02.575 position:50% align:center
You need to stop
wearing Mana's mask.

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:05.787 position:50% align:center
You must choose your own path.

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:09.541 position:50% align:center
If you haven't
given up, that is.

00:04:09.624 --> 00:04:12.377 position:50% align:center
[ALLEN] No matter how
many times I listen,

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:14.879 position:50% align:center
it sounds like it's his will.
Makes me mad.

00:04:14.963 --> 00:04:16.297 position:50% align:center
Are you sure it's not?

00:04:16.381 --> 00:04:20.927 position:50% align:center
It's just that--it's completely
unlike him to do this.

00:04:21.011 --> 00:04:25.056 position:50% align:center
[LINK]
So he is the Fourteenth. Huh.

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.308 position:50% align:center
[LVELLIE] No one has seen
or heard from Cross Marian

00:04:27.392 --> 00:04:29.185 position:50% align:center
since he disappeared.

00:04:29.936 --> 00:04:31.813 position:50% align:center
Our official stance on
the matter is that he's

00:04:31.896 --> 00:04:35.859 position:50% align:center
on extended assignment,
but the truth is classified.

00:04:35.942 --> 00:04:37.819 position:50% align:center
Let's go. Tim.

00:04:37.902 --> 00:04:39.195 position:50% align:center
[LVELLIE]
Tell me, Allen.

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:40.822 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:04:40.905 --> 00:04:44.117 position:50% align:center
Considering that you're the
current host of the Fourteenth,

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.244 position:50% align:center
did you kill your master?

00:04:46.327 --> 00:04:48.079 position:50% align:center
Didn't you have him killed,

00:04:48.163 --> 00:04:49.998 position:50% align:center
Director Lvellie?

00:04:52.667 --> 00:04:55.003 position:50% align:center
After I announce the
Order's plans for Allen,

00:04:55.086 --> 00:04:57.630 position:50% align:center
I'll be returning to
the Central Agency.

00:04:57.714 --> 00:04:59.966 position:50% align:center
There's something regarding
Marian's assassination

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:01.551 position:50% align:center
that I need to look into.

00:05:01.634 --> 00:05:03.511 position:50% align:center
Director?

00:05:03.595 --> 00:05:04.929 position:50% align:center
It wasn't me.

00:05:05.013 --> 00:05:08.433 position:50% align:center
But... it was the doing
of the Central Agency.

00:05:08.516 --> 00:05:10.101 position:50% align:center
Someone saw fit
to carry this out

00:05:10.185 --> 00:05:12.687 position:50% align:center
without bothering to inform me.

00:05:12.771 --> 00:05:15.357 position:50% align:center
It may have to do with
this other side of the war

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.400 position:50% align:center
that Marian spoke of.

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:22.989 position:50% align:center
[LVELLIE] It's been brought to
our attention that Allen Walker

00:05:23.073 --> 00:05:25.408 position:50% align:center
is the host of a Noah
known as the Fourteenth,

00:05:25.492 --> 00:05:28.328 position:50% align:center
and that he carries his
dormant memories.

00:05:28.411 --> 00:05:31.122 position:50% align:center
However, he will officially
retain his position

00:05:31.206 --> 00:05:32.791 position:50% align:center
within the Order and continue

00:05:32.874 --> 00:05:36.878 position:50% align:center
to work alongside the rest of
you, serving as an Exorcist.

00:05:36.961 --> 00:05:40.173 position:50% align:center
The Order is in great need
of his ability as the Pianist.

00:05:40.256 --> 00:05:42.384 position:50% align:center
Not to mention, we simply
cannot afford to lose

00:05:42.467 --> 00:05:44.844 position:50% align:center
any more of our forces
in this battle.

00:05:44.928 --> 00:05:47.555 position:50% align:center
Therefore, Central
Agency has decided

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:50.892 position:50% align:center
to allow a Noah in our
ranks for the time being.

00:05:50.975 --> 00:05:53.645 position:50% align:center
Brother. Is this all true?

00:05:54.688 --> 00:05:56.773 position:50% align:center
Tell them, Chief Komui.

00:05:56.856 --> 00:05:58.316 position:50% align:center
As of this moment,

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.403 position:50% align:center
all Exorcists will work
under a standing order.

00:06:01.486 --> 00:06:05.323 position:50% align:center
If... If the Fourteenth
awakens within him,

00:06:05.407 --> 00:06:07.617 position:50% align:center
and Allen Walker
becomes a threat,

00:06:07.701 --> 00:06:09.119 position:50% align:center
then your given orders are--

00:06:09.202 --> 00:06:11.538 position:50% align:center
[ALLEN] If that happens,
then you are to kill me.

00:06:11.621 --> 00:06:13.665 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:06:13.748 --> 00:06:15.917 position:50% align:center
Although, that will not happen.

00:06:16.001 --> 00:06:18.753 position:50% align:center
If the Fourteenth
turns on the Order,

00:06:18.837 --> 00:06:21.256 position:50% align:center
then I'll stop him myself.

00:06:26.344 --> 00:06:28.471 position:50% align:center
Yep. I make my own path.

00:06:28.555 --> 00:06:30.181 position:50% align:center
Not anyone else.

00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:33.643 position:50% align:center
So, hey, Link.
There's one donut left.

00:06:33.727 --> 00:06:34.686 position:50% align:center
Mind if I eat it?

00:06:34.769 --> 00:06:36.396 position:50% align:center
How many have you already had?

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:37.647 position:50% align:center
[ALLEN laughs]
What?

00:06:37.731 --> 00:06:39.190 position:50% align:center
I suppose we could split
it if you really want.

What's going on, Marie?

00:06:40.692 --> 00:06:42.360 position:50% align:center
Did you hear something
of concern?

00:06:42.444 --> 00:06:44.612 position:50% align:center
No. Nothing like that.

00:06:44.696 --> 00:06:46.114 position:50% align:center

00:06:46.197 --> 00:06:47.741 position:50% align:center
[ALLEN]
Go for Allen.

00:06:47.824 --> 00:06:48.908 position:50% align:center
Quit pigging out.

00:06:48.992 --> 00:06:50.785 position:50% align:center
It's just about go time.

00:06:50.869 --> 00:06:54.039 position:50% align:center
Try not to let the Paris
police steal our prey.

00:06:54.122 --> 00:06:57.167 position:50% align:center
[MARIE] We can't let Phantom
Thief G get away. Got it?

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:59.210 position:50% align:center
Yeah, roger that.

00:06:59.294 --> 00:07:01.755 position:50% align:center
[ALLEN]
Phantom Thief G...

00:07:01.838 --> 00:07:04.299 position:50% align:center
Getting locked up like this
proved our assumption!

00:07:04.382 --> 00:07:07.302 position:50% align:center
There's no doubt that
Innocence is involved here!

00:07:07.385 --> 00:07:09.512 position:50% align:center
Phantom Thief G
is not human!

00:07:09.596 --> 00:07:12.307 position:50% align:center
He's gotta be some
kind of ghost!

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:14.642 position:50% align:center
There are only three
things we know about him.

00:07:14.726 --> 00:07:16.811 position:50% align:center
He's got a flare for costumes.

00:07:16.895 --> 00:07:18.646 position:50% align:center
He always issues a
warning the day before

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:21.191 position:50% align:center
he commits a crime,
and the big one..

00:07:21.274 --> 00:07:23.985 position:50% align:center
He doesn't possess
a physical body!

[DIRECTOR 2A]
Not much.

00:15:41.524 --> 00:15:43.068 position:50% align:center
His father was a thief.

00:15:43.151 --> 00:15:47.989 position:50% align:center
He was actually arrested by
Emilia's father, Captain Galmar.

00:15:48.073 --> 00:15:51.785 position:50% align:center
But before that, in a desperate
attempt to avoid being arrested

00:15:51.868 --> 00:15:56.164 position:50% align:center
the brute hid a stolen jewel by
forcing Timothy to swallow it.

took Timothy

what do you plan to do with him?

00:16:26.945 --> 00:16:28.905 position:50% align:center
He can't stay here.

00:16:28.988 --> 00:16:31.491 position:50% align:center
We'll take him with us
back to the Black Order.
