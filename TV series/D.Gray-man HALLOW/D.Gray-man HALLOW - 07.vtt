[THAT PERSON]
Hey.

00:00:09.175 --> 00:00:11.511 position:50% align:center
Do you know this flower?

00:00:11.594 --> 00:00:14.556 position:50% align:center
[INCARNATION]
Reaching... towards the sky.

00:00:15.974 --> 00:00:17.934 position:50% align:center
[THAT PERSON]
It's a lotus flower.

00:00:18.018 --> 00:00:21.730 position:50% align:center
They're born from mud, yet
they reach towards the sky.

00:00:21.813 --> 00:00:24.524 position:50% align:center
And fill the world with
their sweet fragrance.

00:00:24.607 --> 00:00:26.026 position:50% align:center
Sound familiar to you?

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:27.485 position:50% align:center
They make me think of us.

00:00:27.569 --> 00:00:28.778 position:50% align:center
Of Exorcists.

00:00:28.862 --> 00:00:30.613 position:50% align:center
Born to serve the world.

00:00:32.282 --> 00:00:35.493 position:50% align:center
[INCARNATION]
I love you... forever.

00:00:36.703 --> 00:00:38.747 position:50% align:center
Well, look at that,
you're still alive.

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:41.166 position:50% align:center
Thanks for letting
me know, Exorcist.

00:00:41.249 --> 00:00:42.000 position:50% align:center
[INCARNATION gags]

00:00:42.083 --> 00:00:45.045 position:50% align:center
[KANDA laughs]

00:00:45.128 --> 00:00:46.212 position:50% align:center
[TUI]
Yu.

00:00:46.296 --> 00:00:48.757 position:50% align:center
I'm going to cast a
spell over you now.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.343 position:50% align:center
It may hurt, but it
will be over quickly.

00:00:51.426 --> 00:00:54.346 position:50% align:center
You will then fall asleep,
and you will never awaken.

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:56.556 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:00:56.639 --> 00:00:58.350 position:50% align:center
You've been lying to me.

00:00:58.433 --> 00:01:00.268 position:50% align:center
The Second Exorcist Plan?

00:01:00.352 --> 00:01:02.687 position:50% align:center
Artificial Apostles?!

00:01:02.771 --> 00:01:04.898 position:50% align:center
All lies. All of it.

00:01:04.981 --> 00:01:07.817 position:50% align:center
Everything you
told me was a lie!

00:01:07.901 --> 00:01:09.778 position:50% align:center
I was an Exorcist!

00:01:09.861 --> 00:01:12.614 position:50% align:center
I was murdered by
an Akuma, wasn't I?

00:01:12.697 --> 00:01:13.990 position:50% align:center
What year is...?

00:01:14.074 --> 00:01:18.119 position:50% align:center
How many years have
passed since I died?

00:01:18.203 --> 00:01:19.537 position:50% align:center
What did you do?!

00:01:19.621 --> 00:01:22.374 position:50% align:center
What did you bastards do to us?!

00:01:22.457 --> 00:01:24.959 position:50% align:center
Wait. Oh, god.

00:01:25.043 --> 00:01:27.629 position:50% align:center
That Innocence...

00:01:27.712 --> 00:01:30.965 position:50% align:center
...it already belonged to me.

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.259 position:50% align:center
Let's begin. Chang.

00:01:33.343 --> 00:01:36.596 position:50% align:center
[KANDA screams]

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.765 position:50% align:center
[KANDA]
Why are you doing this?

00:01:38.848 --> 00:01:41.643 position:50% align:center
Aren't we all on the same side?

00:01:41.726 --> 00:01:43.645 position:50% align:center
Innocence is our only chance.

00:01:43.728 --> 00:01:47.440 position:50% align:center
The only thing that
can win this crusade!

00:01:47.524 --> 00:01:50.860 position:50% align:center
[ALMA]
I will... save Yu!

00:01:53.571 --> 00:01:56.241 position:50% align:center
[screaming continues]

00:01:57.367 --> 00:02:00.328 position:50% align:center
[ROAD]
That poor, poor child.

00:02:00.412 --> 00:02:02.163 position:50% align:center
Such a terrible thing to see.

00:02:02.247 --> 00:02:03.873 position:50% align:center
[ALLEN]
See what?

00:02:03.957 --> 00:02:07.794 position:50% align:center
[ROAD] Well... The corpses
of their real bodies.

00:02:07.877 --> 00:02:09.629 position:50% align:center
Their original bodies.

00:02:09.713 --> 00:02:12.841 position:50% align:center
After all of those years,
and all of the Order's

00:02:12.924 --> 00:02:16.261 position:50% align:center
failed experiments on
non-Accommodators,

00:02:16.344 --> 00:02:20.056 position:50% align:center
they began to create artificial
Accommodators in order to keep

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.475 position:50% align:center
their numbers up
and win the holy war.

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:25.687 position:50% align:center
They transplanted the brains of
severely disabled Accommodators

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.773 position:50% align:center
into healthy bodies. All just
to see if the Innocence

00:02:28.857 --> 00:02:33.069 position:50% align:center
synchronization
would transfer as well.

00:02:33.153 --> 00:02:37.032 position:50% align:center
And that was the
Second Exorcist Plan.

00:02:41.911 --> 00:02:43.455 position:50% align:center
[BLACK ORDER MEMBER 7A] He's
endured severe head injuries

00:02:43.538 --> 00:02:44.789 position:50% align:center
while battling Akuma.

00:02:44.873 --> 00:02:48.251 position:50% align:center
Seems to have been critical
for the past hour.

00:02:48.335 --> 00:02:50.837 position:50% align:center
No sign of the virus though.

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:51.921 position:50% align:center
[BLACK ORDER MEMBER 7B]
I've received orders

00:02:52.005 --> 00:02:54.341 position:50% align:center
from Director Lvellie
on the matter.

00:02:54.424 --> 00:02:56.134 position:50% align:center
He's to be used
as a test subject

00:02:56.217 --> 00:03:00.597 position:50% align:center
for the Second Exorcist Plan.
Take him to Research Lab 6.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:01.973 position:50% align:center
[BLACK ORDER MEMBER 7A]
Yes, sir.

00:03:02.057 --> 00:03:04.642 position:50% align:center
The subject's name
is Noise Marie.

00:03:04.726 --> 00:03:06.978 position:50% align:center
Please inform the
lab of his arrival.

00:03:10.774 --> 00:03:13.276 position:50% align:center
[ALMA cries]

00:03:20.492 --> 00:03:24.579 position:50% align:center
[KANDA] She said that we
were like lotus flowers.

00:03:24.662 --> 00:03:29.209 position:50% align:center
They grow from the mud,
and make the world fragrant.

00:03:29.292 --> 00:03:32.754 position:50% align:center
They make it a better place.

00:03:32.837 --> 00:03:36.216 position:50% align:center
[ALMA] But... they wilt
and die in the end.

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:40.387 position:50% align:center
They die, and they sink
back into the mud.

00:03:45.266 --> 00:03:47.560 position:50% align:center
[KANDA, INCARNATION]
Complete darkness.

00:03:47.644 --> 00:03:50.939 position:50% align:center
I never knew it
would feel so good.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.610 position:50% align:center
[THAT PERSON]
Y'know what would be nice?

00:03:55.694 --> 00:03:59.280 position:50% align:center
To see a whole field
like this in full bloom.

00:04:02.242 --> 00:04:03.827 position:50% align:center
[THAT PERSON]
If only...

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.579 position:50% align:center
Maybe we could see
it together someday.

00:04:06.663 --> 00:04:09.958 position:50% align:center
[inaudible]

00:04:10.041 --> 00:04:11.584 position:50% align:center
[THAT PERSON laughs]
Really?

00:04:11.668 --> 00:04:16.756 position:50% align:center
Well, I promise that even
when we both grow old,

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.342 position:50% align:center
I'll wait for you.

00:04:19.426 --> 00:04:20.844 position:50% align:center
Forever.

00:04:22.512 --> 00:04:24.222 position:50% align:center
[THAT PERSON]
I'll be waiting.

00:04:26.766 --> 00:04:30.270 position:50% align:center
[KANDA screams]

00:04:32.731 --> 00:04:34.274 position:50% align:center
[KANDA]
Why?

00:04:37.068 --> 00:04:39.946 position:50% align:center
[KANDA]
Why am I resisting this?

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:41.990 position:50% align:center
Her face is so faint.

00:04:42.073 --> 00:04:44.284 position:50% align:center
I don't even know her name.

00:04:44.367 --> 00:04:46.202 position:50% align:center
I can't remember.

00:04:46.286 --> 00:04:48.538 position:50% align:center
They've annihilated my memories.

00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:54.210 position:50% align:center
[KANDA]
So... why?

00:04:54.294 --> 00:04:58.715 position:50% align:center
Why can't I get rid of
this urge to be with her?!

00:05:05.847 --> 00:05:07.390 position:50% align:center
[KANDA]
Innocence!

00:05:07.474 --> 00:05:08.516 position:50% align:center
Damn it!

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.269 position:50% align:center
Why is it coming to me now?

00:05:11.353 --> 00:05:12.979 position:50% align:center
Just because I was
an Accommodator

00:05:13.063 --> 00:05:17.233 position:50% align:center
in my previous life?
I can't take this anymore!

00:05:19.903 --> 00:05:21.071 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:05:21.154 --> 00:05:24.324 position:50% align:center
[INCARNATION]
But I can use this to survive.

00:05:26.743 --> 00:05:30.705 position:50% align:center
[INCARNATION]
I want... to be with her.

00:07:08.386 --> 00:07:12.557 position:50% align:center
[KANDA coughs]
Heh. I'm such an idiot.

00:07:14.476 --> 00:07:16.394 position:50% align:center
[KANDA]
I'm so stupid.

00:07:17.771 --> 00:07:21.691 position:50% align:center
[KANDA]
What am I supposed to do now?

00:07:21.775 --> 00:07:25.695 position:50% align:center
Am I supposed to just kill
every last person in this lab?

00:07:32.118 --> 00:07:33.286 position:50% align:center
[SAHLINS]
What?!

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:36.748 position:50% align:center
How?! That lab door
is solid steel!

00:07:36.831 --> 00:07:38.750 position:50% align:center
Could Yu have... synchronized?

00:07:38.833 --> 00:07:39.626 position:50% align:center

00:07:48.259 --> 00:07:51.054 position:50% align:center
[BAK] We lost all Golem
communications at once.

00:07:51.137 --> 00:07:55.725 position:50% align:center
What's happening
on the other side?

00:07:55.809 --> 00:07:59.145 position:50% align:center
That boy from the other day...

00:07:59.229 --> 00:08:01.981 position:50% align:center
What the hell could they
be using a child for?

00:08:02.065 --> 00:08:03.817 position:50% align:center
They never tell me anything.

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:06.111 position:50% align:center
I'm sick of being
kept in the dark!

00:08:07.904 --> 00:08:09.406 position:50% align:center

00:08:12.075 --> 00:08:14.160 position:50% align:center

Why, For?

00:08:24.796 --> 00:08:29.050 position:50% align:center
Please. Why aren't you
opening the door, For?

00:08:29.134 --> 00:08:30.969 position:50% align:center
Mother.

00:08:31.052 --> 00:08:32.470 position:50% align:center
Father.

Please, just open the door!

Is this the guy...?

00:08:42.856 --> 00:08:45.608 position:50% align:center
You sure you'll be okay now?

00:08:47.527 --> 00:08:51.281 position:50% align:center
[KANDA] That uniform.
So he is an Exorcist.

00:08:52.657 --> 00:08:54.284 position:50% align:center
[KANDA]
Nasty head wound.

00:08:54.367 --> 00:08:55.452 position:50% align:center
Is he dying?

00:08:55.535 --> 00:08:58.455 position:50% align:center
[KANDA gasps]
Don't tell me...

00:08:58.538 --> 00:09:02.250 position:50% align:center
Are they using him as a
test subject for the plan?

I know that voice.

Alma. Where are you hiding?

00:09:22.979 --> 00:09:25.148 position:50% align:center
[EDGAR] I can't believe
his desire to save Yu

00:09:25.231 --> 00:09:26.983 position:50% align:center
was strong enough to allow him

00:09:27.067 --> 00:09:30.403 position:50% align:center
to successfully synchronize
with the Innocence.

00:09:30.487 --> 00:09:33.531 position:50% align:center
But he immediately lost control
and killed those Crows.

00:09:33.615 --> 00:09:37.660 position:50% align:center
Poor kid must've seen the
original test subjects.

00:09:37.744 --> 00:09:40.080 position:50% align:center
I need to find him and fast.

00:09:40.163 --> 00:09:42.290 position:50% align:center
Those children are
my responsibility.

There you are, Alma!

00:09:52.175 --> 00:09:55.929 position:50% align:center
[MARIE] So, uh...
I'm sorry about this, boy.

00:09:56.012 --> 00:09:57.597 position:50% align:center
These injuries I've got--

00:09:57.681 --> 00:10:00.433 position:50% align:center
Well, if they hadn't
stripped me of my Innocence,

00:10:00.517 --> 00:10:03.061 position:50% align:center
I'd be able to carry
myself just fine.

00:10:03.144 --> 00:10:04.562 position:50% align:center
[KANDA]
Heh.

00:10:04.646 --> 00:10:06.064 position:50% align:center
But I've gotta say, boy,

00:10:06.147 --> 00:10:08.316 position:50% align:center
you're a lot stronger
than I thought you'd be.

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:10.068 position:50% align:center
Yeah, well, there's
a reason for that.

00:10:10.151 --> 00:10:14.155 position:50% align:center
Oh, and you might wanna stop
calling me boy--or you die!

00:10:14.239 --> 00:10:16.199 position:50% align:center
Fair enough, what should
I call you then?

00:10:16.282 --> 00:10:18.493 position:50% align:center
My name's Noise Marie.

00:10:18.576 --> 00:10:23.415 position:50% align:center
[KANDA growls] You know,
you're so calm about this.

00:10:23.498 --> 00:10:26.960 position:50% align:center
About getting turned into
a lab rat for the Order?

00:10:27.043 --> 00:10:28.378 position:50% align:center
I'm not calm.

00:10:28.461 --> 00:10:31.297 position:50% align:center

So, what are we waiting for?

00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:05.186 position:50% align:center
Let's get this party started!

00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:09.357 position:50% align:center
As Wisely so eloquently stated
earlier, you're all doomed

00:19:09.441 --> 00:19:12.652 position:50% align:center
to be destroyed by your
own demonic creation.

00:19:12.736 --> 00:19:16.281 position:50% align:center
Yes, the sun has risen over
the dawn of man's judgment,

00:19:16.364 --> 00:19:18.074 position:50% align:center
and Alma Karma has awakened!

00:19:18.158 --> 00:19:19.534 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:19.617 --> 00:19:23.038 position:50% align:center
[MILLENNIUM EARL] Prepare
yourselves for the new day!

00:19:23.121 --> 00:19:24.998 position:50% align:center
What the heck is that?

00:19:25.081 --> 00:19:26.082 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:29.919 position:50% align:center
[ALLEN]
Alma!

00:19:30.003 --> 00:19:31.796 position:50% align:center
Alma's starting to wake up!

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:36.301 position:50% align:center
And all of his hatred is
converting into Dark Matter!

00:19:36.384 --> 00:19:37.635 position:50% align:center
Wait, do you mean...

00:19:37.719 --> 00:19:39.512 position:50% align:center
[JOHNNY]
It's as bad as it sounds!

00:19:39.596 --> 00:19:42.515 position:50% align:center
That much Dark Matter...
He's becoming an Akuma!

00:19:42.599 --> 00:19:44.017 position:50% align:center
Don't say that.

00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:45.185 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:45.268 --> 00:19:46.519 position:50% align:center
[TOKUSA grunts]

00:19:54.819 --> 00:19:56.071 position:50% align:center
[MILLENNIUM EARL]
Kill 'em all.

00:19:56.154 --> 00:19:57.697 position:50% align:center
Allen!

00:19:57.781 --> 00:19:59.115 position:50% align:center
Johnny!

00:20:04.746 --> 00:20:06.581 position:50% align:center
[ALMA KARMA grunting]

00:20:06.664 --> 00:20:08.166 position:50% align:center
It's so... hot!

00:20:08.249 --> 00:20:09.459 position:50% align:center
Can't take it!

00:20:09.542 --> 00:20:12.629 position:50% align:center
No! We can't let this happen!

00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:16.132 position:50% align:center
Uh! This light.

00:20:16.216 --> 00:20:18.009 position:50% align:center
It's the Akuma Virus!

00:20:18.093 --> 00:20:19.135 position:50% align:center
[ALMA KARMA screaming]

00:20:19.219 --> 00:20:20.553 position:50% align:center
[ALLEN]
Stop it, Alma!

00:20:20.637 --> 00:20:22.806 position:50% align:center
Please, there are
innocent people here!

00:20:22.889 --> 00:20:25.058 position:50% align:center
[screaming]

00:20:31.690 --> 00:20:33.358 position:50% align:center
[LINK]
What the hell?

00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:35.026 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:36.277 position:50% align:center
[STAFF MEMBER 7A]
This is HQ.

00:20:36.361 --> 00:20:38.738 position:50% align:center
What happened?!
What was that sound?!

00:20:38.822 --> 00:20:40.031 position:50% align:center
[LINK]
Well, it wasn't us.

00:20:40.115 --> 00:20:42.242 position:50% align:center
But we saw a bright
flash in the distance.

00:20:42.325 --> 00:20:43.702 position:50% align:center
The North American Branch.

00:20:43.785 --> 00:20:45.829 position:50% align:center
It came from there.

00:20:45.912 --> 00:20:47.914 position:50% align:center
[TEWAKU groaning]

00:20:47.997 --> 00:20:50.333 position:50% align:center
[LINK] Isn't there another
gate closer to the branch?

00:20:50.417 --> 00:20:51.876 position:50% align:center
[panting]

00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:53.128 position:50% align:center
[STAFF MEMBER 7A]
Yes, there is,

00:20:53.211 --> 00:20:55.422 position:50% align:center
but it's inside the
Hekiji barrier.

00:20:55.505 --> 00:20:57.632 position:50% align:center
[TEWAKU]
What... What was that?

00:20:57.716 --> 00:20:59.884 position:50% align:center
[LINK]
What's wrong, Tewaku?

00:20:59.968 --> 00:21:01.761 position:50% align:center
[TEWAKU]
Nothing, I just got dizzy.

00:21:01.845 --> 00:21:03.972 position:50% align:center
It's nothing to
worry about, really.

00:21:04.055 --> 00:21:08.059 position:50% align:center
You wouldn't keep a vision
from me, would you?

00:21:08.143 --> 00:21:10.729 position:50% align:center
The Third Exorcists are
not going to turn out

00:21:10.812 --> 00:21:12.897 position:50% align:center
like the Noah said.

00:21:12.981 --> 00:21:17.068 position:50% align:center
So, then. We can't use the
closest backup gate, can we?

00:21:17.152 --> 00:21:19.904 position:50% align:center
[LINK]
No. So we better get moving.

00:21:24.367 --> 00:21:26.995 position:50% align:center
[LINK] That was definitely
an explosion earlier.

00:21:27.078 --> 00:21:29.289 position:50% align:center
What the hell is happening?

00:21:29.372 --> 00:21:32.125 position:50% align:center
I hope you're all right, Walker.

00:21:41.426 --> 00:21:42.969 position:50% align:center
[gasping]

00:21:49.517 --> 00:21:52.729 position:50% align:center
[MILLENNIUM EARL laughs]
Oh, boy.

00:21:52.812 --> 00:21:56.733 position:50% align:center
I have a feeling that we're in
for a world of entertainment.

00:21:56.816 --> 00:21:58.568 position:50% align:center
Suffer, Allen Walker.

00:21:58.651 --> 00:22:01.821 position:50% align:center
Writhe in breathtaking agony.

00:22:01.905 --> 00:22:03.490 position:50% align:center
Enough with the overture!

00:22:03.573 --> 00:22:06.534 position:50% align:center
Let the real show begin!

00:22:11.414 --> 00:22:12.999 position:50% align:center
[ALMA KARMA]
Humans?

00:22:26.179 --> 00:22:27.889 position:50% align:center
[ALMA KARMA]
Yu Kanda?

00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:46.426 position:50% align:center
[LINK] Alma Karma awakens
as an Akuma,

00:23:46.509 --> 00:23:48.511 position:50% align:center
and the cells from
his body rampage

00:23:48.595 --> 00:23:50.555 position:50% align:center
inside the Third Exorcists.

00:23:50.638 --> 00:23:53.099 position:50% align:center
What is the Millennium
Earl's true goal?

00:23:53.183 --> 00:23:56.519 position:50% align:center
Next time, Night 8:
"Awakening."
