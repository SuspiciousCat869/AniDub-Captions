00:21:43.136 --> 00:21:45.680 position:50% align:center
Although, that will not happen.

00:21:45.764 --> 00:21:48.308 position:50% align:center
If the Fourteenth
turns on the Order,

00:21:48.391 --> 00:21:51.311 position:50% align:center
then I'll stop him myself.

00:21:51.394 --> 00:21:54.564 position:50% align:center
[LENALEE]
He's still Allen.

00:21:54.647 --> 00:21:56.441 position:50% align:center
As of this moment forward,

00:21:56.524 --> 00:21:59.402 position:50% align:center
Allen Walker's Exorcist
status is suspended...

00:21:59.486 --> 00:22:00.612 position:50% align:center
[LENALEE gasps]

00:22:00.695 --> 00:22:03.031 position:50% align:center
[KOMUI] ...and he is
to be considered a Noah!

00:22:09.412 --> 00:22:12.415 position:50% align:center
I know that Allen
would never run.

00:22:12.499 --> 00:22:13.875 position:50% align:center
I have to bring him back.

00:22:13.958 --> 00:22:16.461 position:50% align:center
This has to be a trap
set by the Noah!

00:22:16.544 --> 00:22:17.712 position:50% align:center
He would never.

00:22:17.796 --> 00:22:20.674 position:50% align:center
Allen would never
betray the Order!

00:22:20.757 --> 00:22:25.470 position:50% align:center
Please don't go! Please! Allen!

00:23:43.006 --> 00:23:45.383 position:50% align:center
[LENALEE] The Order labels
Allen a deserter and a Noah,

00:23:45.467 --> 00:23:47.469 position:50% align:center
issuing an order to capture him.

00:23:47.552 --> 00:23:49.179 position:50% align:center
We try to pursue,
but we're thwarted

00:23:49.262 --> 00:23:51.014 position:50% align:center
by Akuma and the Thirds.

00:23:51.097 --> 00:23:52.807 position:50% align:center
Don't go. Allen!

00:23:52.891 --> 00:23:55.643 position:50% align:center
Next time: Night 12, "My Home."
