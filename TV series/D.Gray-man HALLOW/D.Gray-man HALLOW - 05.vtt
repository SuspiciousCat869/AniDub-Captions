00:00:10.927 --> 00:00:14.139 position:50% align:center
[RENNY] He's unconscious, so
there's nothing to worry about.

00:00:14.222 --> 00:00:15.682 position:50% align:center
Get as close as you want.

00:00:15.765 --> 00:00:16.891 position:50% align:center
You're safe.

00:00:16.975 --> 00:00:18.351 position:50% align:center
Why're you all the way
back there, Johnny?

00:00:18.435 --> 00:00:20.395 position:50% align:center
Step up here so
you can observe him.

00:00:20.478 --> 00:00:22.731 position:50% align:center
Um. Right.

00:00:24.357 --> 00:00:26.234 position:50% align:center
This is Alma Karma.

00:00:26.317 --> 00:00:28.903 position:50% align:center
He's the only successful
instance of fusion

00:00:28.987 --> 00:00:31.489 position:50% align:center
with the nucleus
of the Akuma Egg.

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:35.035 position:50% align:center
[RENNY] His extracted
cells were used to create

00:00:35.118 --> 00:00:39.456 position:50% align:center
the five Third Exorcists through
a form of mitotic parentage.

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:41.833 position:50% align:center
[BARROWS] I can't believe
he's still alive.

00:00:41.916 --> 00:00:45.045 position:50% align:center
I heard rumors they had him
stashed away somewhere.

00:00:45.128 --> 00:00:48.506 position:50% align:center
It's weird to think the Order
would hide him from us.

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.509 position:50% align:center
--Um. Section Chief Reever.
--Hm?

00:00:51.593 --> 00:00:55.305 position:50% align:center
He is... A human, isn't he?

00:00:55.388 --> 00:00:57.807 position:50% align:center
It's tough to tell
with those scars.

00:00:57.891 --> 00:01:01.353 position:50% align:center
But it looks like he's close
to the same age as Allen.

00:01:01.436 --> 00:01:02.937 position:50% align:center
So why...

00:01:03.021 --> 00:01:06.232 position:50% align:center
Why would they have used a child
to create the first parent body?

00:01:06.316 --> 00:01:08.610 position:50% align:center
[PEK]
He's a Second Exorcist.

00:01:08.693 --> 00:01:09.611 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:01:09.694 --> 00:01:11.321 position:50% align:center
He's not just some
ordinary child.

00:01:11.404 --> 00:01:14.866 position:50% align:center
He's a synthetic Apostle made
by the Order nine years ago.

00:01:14.949 --> 00:01:17.202 position:50% align:center
Well. A failed one
to be precise.

00:01:17.285 --> 00:01:18.995 position:50% align:center
Are you catching
all this, Matthew?

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:20.914 position:50% align:center
Yes, Section Chief Pek!

00:01:20.997 --> 00:01:23.208 position:50% align:center
[JOHNNY]
A synthetic Apostle?

00:01:23.291 --> 00:01:26.628 position:50% align:center
[RENNY] The nuclei renders
normal human tissue necrotic.

00:01:26.711 --> 00:01:29.381 position:50% align:center
This leads to death shortly
after the fusion.

00:01:29.464 --> 00:01:33.301 position:50% align:center
However, Seconds have
regenerative capabilities.

00:01:33.385 --> 00:01:36.388 position:50% align:center
So they can endure
the erosive energy.

00:01:36.471 --> 00:01:38.515 position:50% align:center
You section chiefs
are already familiar

00:01:38.598 --> 00:01:40.642 position:50% align:center
with the Seconds, correct?

00:01:43.395 --> 00:01:45.146 position:50% align:center
[JOHNNY]
The Second Exorcists.

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:48.525 position:50% align:center
Two test subjects scientifically
created in the lab

00:01:48.608 --> 00:01:51.611 position:50% align:center
as part of the Artificial
Apostle program.

00:01:53.071 --> 00:01:54.364 position:50% align:center
Master Zu?

00:01:54.447 --> 00:01:55.657 position:50% align:center
[ZU]
Let me through.

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.492 position:50% align:center
I need to speak with Alma.

00:01:57.575 --> 00:01:58.993 position:50% align:center
Now, wait

00:01:59.077 --> 00:02:02.789 position:50% align:center
Just give him a minute. You know
that we owe him that much.

00:02:02.872 --> 00:02:06.835 position:50% align:center
Alma. Is that really
you, my boy?

00:02:06.918 --> 00:02:09.004 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry that
this is what they've

00:02:09.087 --> 00:02:11.673 position:50% align:center
chosen to do with your life.

00:02:11.756 --> 00:02:14.134 position:50% align:center
[LVELLIE] There's really no
point in talking to him.

00:02:14.217 --> 00:02:17.762 position:50% align:center
He's been comatose
for many years now.

00:02:17.846 --> 00:02:19.305 position:50% align:center
Why, Malcolm?

00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:22.684 position:50% align:center
Why have you been hiding the
fact that he's alive from me?

00:02:22.767 --> 00:02:24.602 position:50% align:center
If things hadn't grown so dire,

00:02:24.686 --> 00:02:27.564 position:50% align:center
I would've kept it a secret
for all of eternity.

00:02:27.647 --> 00:02:28.732 position:50% align:center
[ZU]
What?

00:02:28.815 --> 00:02:29.983 position:50% align:center
[LVELLIE]
Would you have been okay with us

00:02:30.066 --> 00:02:32.360 position:50% align:center
keeping him alive
as a guinea pig?

00:02:32.444 --> 00:02:34.362 position:50% align:center
To excavate and
utilize his cells

00:02:34.446 --> 00:02:36.906 position:50% align:center
to initiate the Third
Exorcist program?

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.116 position:50% align:center
Let's be honest.

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:41.661 position:50% align:center
There's no way you would
have accepted that.

00:02:41.745 --> 00:02:45.665 position:50% align:center
Nine years ago, the experiment
was overseen by the Chang

00:02:45.749 --> 00:02:48.168 position:50% align:center
and the Epstain families.

00:02:49.961 --> 00:02:52.005 position:50% align:center
[LVELLIE] And they both
greatly suffered for it

00:02:52.088 --> 00:02:55.884 position:50% align:center
when Alma brutally murdered
the heads of their houses.

00:02:55.967 --> 00:02:58.678 position:50% align:center
I kept his survival quiet
out of consideration

00:02:58.762 --> 00:03:00.305 position:50% align:center
for their loved ones.

00:03:00.388 --> 00:03:02.223 position:50% align:center
[JOHNNY]
He murdered them?

00:03:02.307 --> 00:03:04.893 position:50% align:center
"The test subject
Alma lost control

00:03:04.976 --> 00:03:09.272 position:50% align:center
and killed all 46 members
of the research lab."

00:03:09.356 --> 00:03:12.317 position:50% align:center
[ZU] Did you at least have the
decency to share the truth

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.861 position:50% align:center
of what you've done
with Yu Kanda?

00:03:14.944 --> 00:03:17.405 position:50% align:center
Well, that strikes
me as cruelty.

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:20.492 position:50% align:center
The two were close friends
as children, were they not?

00:03:20.575 --> 00:03:22.494 position:50% align:center
If I told him the truth,

00:03:22.577 --> 00:03:25.038 position:50% align:center
it would only cause him pain.

00:03:25.121 --> 00:03:29.000 position:50% align:center
[JOHNNY] "Out of the experiment
only one subject survived.

00:03:29.084 --> 00:03:29.876 position:50% align:center
Yu."

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:31.503 position:50% align:center
It's our fault they were forced

00:03:31.586 --> 00:03:34.381 position:50% align:center
to fight each other
to the death!

00:03:34.464 --> 00:03:36.383 position:50% align:center
[JOHNNY]
"Subject Yu so thoroughly

00:03:36.466 --> 00:03:39.010 position:50% align:center

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:46.101 position:50% align:center
He just barfed on me!

00:03:46.184 --> 00:03:47.686 position:50% align:center
[MATHEW] Uh! How could you
do that to Chief Pek?!

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:51.523 position:50% align:center
[JOHNNY] "...that Alma was
no longer able to regenerate."

This is where they're storing

00:03:57.696 --> 00:04:00.448 position:50% align:center
Alma Karma, Millennium Earl.

[MILLENNIUM EARL]
We've found him at last, Road.

00:04:02.534 --> 00:04:03.910 position:50% align:center
Let's go.

00:05:35.293 --> 00:05:36.753 position:50% align:center
[PEK]
Seriously.

00:05:36.836 --> 00:05:38.588 position:50% align:center
Puking over gory pictures.

How are you part of the Order?

I... I've never seen that
kind of savagery before.

00:05:43.927 --> 00:05:45.804 position:50% align:center
[groans] I'm sorry.

00:05:45.887 --> 00:05:47.389 position:50% align:center
[PEK]
Not good enough!

00:05:47.472 --> 00:05:51.309 position:50% align:center
Director Lvellie kicked us out
because of your weak stomach!

00:05:51.393 --> 00:05:54.145 position:50% align:center
You ruined my only chance
to study Alma Karma!

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:55.313 position:50% align:center
Section Chief Pek.

00:05:55.397 --> 00:05:57.941 position:50% align:center
I apologize for my
subordinate, all right?

00:05:58.024 --> 00:05:59.484 position:50% align:center
[PEK]
Oh, do you?

00:05:59.567 --> 00:06:01.403 position:50% align:center
Why'd you bring an
inessential assistant

00:06:01.486 --> 00:06:04.614 position:50% align:center
to such a vital meeting, Reever?

00:06:04.698 --> 00:06:05.740 position:50% align:center
Leave the Order!

00:06:05.824 --> 00:06:07.117 position:50% align:center
Damn four-eyes!

[MATHEW] You wear glasses too,
Section Chief.

00:06:10.995 --> 00:06:12.997 position:50% align:center
[REEVER] What you saw
was very disturbing.

00:06:13.081 --> 00:06:17.002 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry, really.
It's just that...

00:06:17.085 --> 00:06:20.422 position:50% align:center
I'm not even sure what my
purpose here is anymore.

00:06:20.505 --> 00:06:21.881 position:50% align:center
Can I ask...

00:06:21.965 --> 00:06:25.844 position:50% align:center
Why did you choose me
to come with you today?

00:06:25.927 --> 00:06:26.970 position:50% align:center
It's because...

[alarm blares]

You're right, y'know, it is sad.

Old friends fighting each
other to the death, I mean.

00:06:42.861 --> 00:06:45.113 position:50% align:center
Just like the
Fourteenth and me.

00:06:45.196 --> 00:06:46.865 position:50% align:center
[ROAD]
Oh, I-I wasn't thinking.

00:06:46.948 --> 00:06:50.201 position:50% align:center
That was really rough
on you, wasn't it?

00:06:50.285 --> 00:06:52.454 position:50% align:center
Yeah, it was. Incredibly rough.

00:06:52.537 --> 00:06:53.705 position:50% align:center
Why'd you mention it?

00:06:53.788 --> 00:06:56.291 position:50% align:center
[ROAD] What? You're the
one who brought it up!

00:06:56.374 --> 00:06:59.419 position:50% align:center
Ah... Jeez, you can
be such a crybaby!

00:06:59.502 --> 00:07:01.713 position:50% align:center
Are you gonna fight
Allen like that?

00:07:11.014 --> 00:07:12.307 position:50% align:center
So I got emotional.

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:14.434 position:50% align:center
Don't tell the others, please.

00:07:14.517 --> 00:07:17.979 position:50% align:center
All that really matters is
that I'm the Millennium Earl.

00:07:18.063 --> 00:07:21.232 position:50% align:center
The first apostle of Adam.

00:07:21.316 --> 00:07:24.069 position:50% align:center
My emotions are wholly
irrelevant because there's

00:07:24.152 --> 00:07:27.614 position:50% align:center
only one thing the Millennium
Earl cares about.

00:07:27.697 --> 00:07:30.617 position:50% align:center
Ripping the heart from every
last Exorcist's chest,

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:33.745 position:50% align:center
and banishing God
to the outer darkness!

Get up, Johnny!

You really wanna die
in North America?

00:08:06.111 --> 00:08:08.738 position:50% align:center
What's the one thing
we need to do right now?

I don't know.

00:08:09.948 --> 00:08:11.408 position:50% align:center
Survive.

00:08:11.491 --> 00:08:15.161 position:50% align:center
We've both seen the inhumane
experiments the Order conducts.

00:08:15.245 --> 00:08:17.414 position:50% align:center
But we have to keep watching.

00:08:17.497 --> 00:08:19.833 position:50% align:center
Carefully observe their actions.

00:08:19.916 --> 00:08:21.167 position:50% align:center
We know what's right,

So live. Hold them accountable.

Survive to show
them what's right.

00:08:27.132 --> 00:08:30.051 position:50% align:center
That's the most important
thing we can do!

[JOHNNY]
Section Chief Reever...

00:08:33.388 --> 00:08:36.141 position:50% align:center
[JOHNNY] I can't forget
the vow I made that day.

00:08:36.224 --> 00:08:39.769 position:50% align:center
To do everything I can for the
Exorcists and my colleagues.

00:08:42.105 --> 00:08:43.857 position:50% align:center

Let's go, Section Chief.

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:45.150 position:50% align:center
You okay?

00:08:45.233 --> 00:08:46.901 position:50% align:center

[REEVER]
All right. Let's go catch up!

00:08:50.655 --> 00:08:51.948 position:50% align:center
Got it!

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:01.708 position:50% align:center

Wh-What's happening?

00:09:01.791 --> 00:09:05.462 position:50% align:center
[REEVER]
I can't... speak!

00:09:05.545 --> 00:09:08.465 position:50% align:center

My body's moving on its own.

00:09:08.548 --> 00:09:12.052 position:50% align:center

No. The shelter's the other way!

00:09:12.135 --> 00:09:15.597 position:50% align:center
Dammit! Where the hell
are they taking us?

00:09:17.932 --> 00:09:19.893 position:50% align:center

This must be psychokinesis.

00:09:19.976 --> 00:09:21.394 position:50% align:center
[REEVER]
It's so silent.

00:09:21.478 --> 00:09:24.814 position:50% align:center
Is the entire North American
branch under their control?

00:09:24.898 --> 00:09:26.232 position:50% align:center
[MILLENNIUM EARL]
Oh, goodie.

00:09:26.316 --> 00:09:27.942 position:50% align:center

The Millennium Earl?

00:09:32.614 --> 00:09:34.240 position:50% align:center
[PEK] This... This is
like a nightmare!

00:09:34.324 --> 00:09:36.826 position:50% align:center
They've marched us in like
lambs to the slaughter!

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:39.871 position:50% align:center
[MILLENNIUM EARL] Oh, now don't
be shy, c'mon on in and line up.

[REEVER]
Dammit!

His head's so pretty!

00:09:43.083 --> 00:09:44.918 position:50% align:center
You didn't have to smash it!

00:09:45.001 --> 00:09:47.504 position:50% align:center
[WISELY] Well, he looked like he
was strong enough to take it.

00:09:47.587 --> 00:09:48.838 position:50% align:center
And what's it matter?

00:09:48.922 --> 00:09:50.340 position:50% align:center
He's a Second, right?

00:09:50.423 --> 00:09:52.717 position:50% align:center

You are so reckless.

00:09:52.801 --> 00:09:55.804 position:50% align:center

Is that... Kanda?

00:09:55.887 --> 00:09:58.723 position:50% align:center

Why? Why do they have Kanda?

00:09:58.807 --> 00:10:01.810 position:50% align:center
Don't tell me.
Could they be trying to...

00:10:01.893 --> 00:10:03.937 position:50% align:center
Oh, that we are, old master.

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:05.855 position:50% align:center

Love and tragedy.

You should know that volatile
mix better than anyone.

00:10:10.944 --> 00:10:13.321 position:50% align:center
You play with explosive toys,

00:10:13.405 --> 00:10:15.907 position:50% align:center
you're bound to
lose a face or two.

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:19.994 position:50% align:center
Your hatred has finally
turned the tables on you.

00:10:20.078 --> 00:10:22.038 position:50% align:center
The Black Order will
be destroyed

00:10:22.122 --> 00:10:24.541 position:50% align:center
by its own demonic creation.

00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:29.004 position:50% align:center

What are they trying to do?

[LVELLIE]
They can't wake him.

00:10:30.338 --> 00:10:32.924 position:50% align:center
Alma's been in a coma
for nine years now.

00:10:33.008 --> 00:10:34.259 position:50% align:center
[WISELY]
You have a point.

00:10:34.342 --> 00:10:36.928 position:50% align:center
There's no denying that
Alma's mind is closed off.

00:10:37.012 --> 00:10:40.056 position:50% align:center
Closed so tight my Evil
Eye can't peek inside.

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:43.393 position:50% align:center

what this guy can do.

[BOY]
I'm so happy!

00:10:53.945 --> 00:10:57.282 position:50% align:center
[BOY] I was afraid
that I was the only one.

00:10:57.365 --> 00:11:01.369 position:50% align:center
They already told me
that your name is Yu.

00:11:01.453 --> 00:11:02.996 position:50% align:center
Huh? My name?

00:11:03.079 --> 00:11:03.997 position:50% align:center
Oh, well.

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:07.584 position:50% align:center
They told me that
my name is Alma.

00:11:10.879 --> 00:11:14.758 position:50% align:center
[ZU] How awful,
to be reunited like this.

00:11:14.841 --> 00:11:17.552 position:50% align:center

rouse this sleepy head!

00:11:17.635 --> 00:11:20.805 position:50% align:center
Rise and shine, Alma, it's the
dawn of man's judgment!

[SHERYL] Please, Lord
Millennium, patience.

We have a few guests
running fashionably late.

00:11:27.354 --> 00:11:29.689 position:50% align:center
Which is rude, considering
the trouble we went to

00:11:29.773 --> 00:11:31.691 position:50% align:center
using the Thirds as bait.

There he is.

Allen Walker!

00:11:58.802 --> 00:12:00.804 position:50% align:center
The Akuma virus.

00:12:06.059 --> 00:12:09.104 position:50% align:center
They completely
annihilated this camp.

00:12:09.187 --> 00:12:13.650 position:50% align:center
[TEWAKU] So that Noah. I'm the
only one he allowed to live.

What did they do to you?

00:12:19.406 --> 00:12:20.657 position:50% align:center
I was dreaming.

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:24.994 position:50% align:center
It was like these strange
images invaded my mind.

00:12:25.078 --> 00:12:27.247 position:50% align:center
Tokusa and my
brother Madarao.

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:30.834 position:50% align:center
I saw Allen Walker killing them.

00:12:30.917 --> 00:12:32.752 position:50% align:center
And I saw myself.

00:12:32.836 --> 00:12:34.337 position:50% align:center

that's what's bound to happen?

Kanda? How did you get here?

00:13:40.737 --> 00:13:42.947 position:50% align:center
You were defending

[SHERYL] Not much point
in defending a camp

00:13:44.908 --> 00:13:45.950 position:50% align:center

He's gonna do what to us?

Jeez, boy.

I what...?

00:15:05.947 --> 00:15:08.158 position:50% align:center
You are not just some
replacement Pianist

00:15:08.241 --> 00:15:09.701 position:50% align:center
as decreed by the Fourteenth.

He knows?

Is that true? Is Allen
really the Fourteenth?

00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:22.380 position:50% align:center
Now that the cat's
out of the bag--

00:15:22.464 --> 00:15:25.675 position:50% align:center
I have no intentions of letting
you return to the Order again.

00:15:25.759 --> 00:15:27.135 position:50% align:center
That's the deal.

00:15:28.303 --> 00:15:30.513 position:50% align:center
You know I manufacture Akuma,

00:15:30.597 --> 00:15:33.141 position:50% align:center
they're the bedrock
of my whole operation.

00:15:33.224 --> 00:15:34.893 position:50% align:center
They're my limbs and my eyes.

00:15:34.976 --> 00:15:37.145 position:50% align:center
What they see, I see.

00:15:37.228 --> 00:15:38.855 position:50% align:center
And you caught my attention.

00:15:38.938 --> 00:15:42.400 position:50% align:center
You spoke to me through
that Akuma, and I listened.

00:15:42.484 --> 00:15:45.528 position:50% align:center
Good morning.

00:15:47.572 --> 00:15:49.991 position:50% align:center
[MILLENNIUM EARL] It was quite
a shock, to say the least!

00:15:50.075 --> 00:15:51.493 position:50% align:center
What're you talking about?

00:15:51.576 --> 00:15:53.745 position:50% align:center
I never said-- [gasps]

00:15:56.164 --> 00:15:59.042 position:50% align:center
Ah. Okay, you got me.

00:16:00.627 --> 00:16:03.380 position:50% align:center
[THE 14TH] I just wanted
to reach out to you.

00:16:03.463 --> 00:16:06.049 position:50% align:center
And tell you that
I'm finally back.

00:16:06.132 --> 00:16:09.386 position:50% align:center
[MILLENNIUM EARL]
It's really you! The Fourteenth?

00:16:09.469 --> 00:16:12.138 position:50% align:center
[THE 14TH] I knew that you
would come for me, Brother.

00:16:12.222 --> 00:16:15.517 position:50% align:center
But this time...
I'll kill you for sure.

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:18.103 position:50% align:center
And after you're dead and
gone, I'll take your place

00:16:18.186 --> 00:16:20.105 position:50% align:center
as the Millennium Earl!

00:16:21.981 --> 00:16:23.400 position:50% align:center
So all this time,

00:16:23.483 --> 00:16:27.153 position:50% align:center
that's what your murderous
treachery has been about.

00:16:27.237 --> 00:16:30.031 position:50% align:center
[ALLEN]
Get out! No, I can't be!

00:16:30.115 --> 00:16:32.242 position:50% align:center
I am not the Fourteenth!

00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:37.539 position:50% align:center
What's happening?

00:16:37.622 --> 00:16:38.707 position:50% align:center
This feeling?

00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:41.418 position:50% align:center
It's like my insides
are revolting!

00:16:42.502 --> 00:16:43.878 position:50% align:center
[CROSS]
Over the course of time,

00:16:43.962 --> 00:16:46.131 position:50% align:center
the implanted memories
will consume you,

00:16:46.214 --> 00:16:48.425 position:50% align:center
and you will eventually
become the Fourteenth.

00:16:48.508 --> 00:16:49.926 position:50% align:center
[ALLEN gasping]

00:16:51.636 --> 00:16:54.472 position:50% align:center
[CROSS] Once you become
the Fourteenth, you'll have

00:16:54.556 --> 00:16:59.060 position:50% align:center
no choice but to kill someone
that you care about.

00:16:59.144 --> 00:17:00.437 position:50% align:center
[ALLEN grunting]

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:02.272 position:50% align:center
[screams]

00:17:02.355 --> 00:17:05.275 position:50% align:center
I refuse to accept that!

00:17:06.026 --> 00:17:08.611 position:50% align:center
[MILLENNIUM EARL]
Head butting?! Ahh!

00:17:08.695 --> 00:17:14.200 position:50% align:center
Listen up, Earl and you the
Fourteenth, you listen good!

00:17:14.284 --> 00:17:16.411 position:50% align:center
My name is Allen Walker!

00:17:16.494 --> 00:17:17.746 position:50% align:center
I'm an Exorcist!

00:17:17.829 --> 00:17:20.331 position:50% align:center
And I will not be anyone else!

00:17:20.415 --> 00:17:22.208 position:50% align:center
I'd rather die than
get dragged into

00:17:22.292 --> 00:17:26.004 position:50% align:center
your stupid, sibling quarrel!
You're just annoying!

00:17:26.087 --> 00:17:28.173 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow. Road.

00:17:28.256 --> 00:17:31.676 position:50% align:center
Gotta say, this kid's starting
to peak my interest.

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:34.679 position:50% align:center
[WISELY]
What the...? Lord Millennium!

00:17:34.763 --> 00:17:36.556 position:50% align:center
[MILLENNIUM EARL]
Oh, crap!

00:17:36.639 --> 00:17:39.100 position:50% align:center
Ah! He kidnapped my Road!

00:17:39.184 --> 00:17:41.519 position:50% align:center
How could you let him
grab her like that?!

00:17:41.603 --> 00:17:45.023 position:50% align:center
Do I need to remind you I'm
not the fighter of the bunch?

00:17:45.106 --> 00:17:46.274 position:50% align:center
[ALLEN]
Bastard!

00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:51.529 position:50% align:center
[ALLEN]
You okay, Tokusa?

00:17:51.613 --> 00:17:53.698 position:50% align:center
[SHERYL] No, no, no, no, I'm not
all right, ow, lots of pain!

00:17:53.782 --> 00:17:54.949 position:50% align:center
Wait, Kanda.

00:17:55.033 --> 00:17:56.576 position:50% align:center
You can suddenly move?

00:17:56.659 --> 00:17:57.952 position:50% align:center
[KANDA]
What of it?

00:17:58.036 --> 00:18:00.789 position:50% align:center
Well you've been frozen
motionless this entire time!

00:18:00.872 --> 00:18:04.042 position:50% align:center
[KANDA] I was strategically
assessing the situation.

00:18:04.125 --> 00:18:06.628 position:50% align:center
[ROAD screams] Quit undressing
me! You big perv!

00:18:06.711 --> 00:18:07.796 position:50% align:center
[KANDA]
Shut up, Road!

00:18:07.879 --> 00:18:09.506 position:50% align:center
I don't know where
my hair string went,

00:18:09.589 --> 00:18:11.800 position:50% align:center
so I'm taking your ribbon.

00:18:11.883 --> 00:18:14.177 position:50% align:center
[ALLEN] That's the only
reason you captured her?

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:17.389 position:50% align:center
[TOKUSA] Listen, we should
retreat and regroup.

00:18:18.515 --> 00:18:19.391 position:50% align:center
[BAK]
What's happening?

00:18:19.474 --> 00:18:20.558 position:50% align:center
[ALLEN gasps]

00:18:23.770 --> 00:18:25.438 position:50% align:center
[ALLEN]
The exit. They blocked it!

00:18:25.522 --> 00:18:27.649 position:50% align:center
[SHERYL]
Oh, you lowly worms.

00:18:27.732 --> 00:18:30.902 position:50% align:center
What is it gonna take to
make you understand?

00:18:30.985 --> 00:18:33.405 position:50% align:center
Especially, you,
the Fourteenth.

00:18:33.488 --> 00:18:36.116 position:50% align:center
[MILLENNIUM EARL] I was dead
serious about never letting you

00:18:36.199 --> 00:18:37.826 position:50% align:center
return to the Order again.

00:18:37.909 --> 00:18:39.327 position:50% align:center
Trust me, Allen Walker.

00:18:39.411 --> 00:18:42.080 position:50% align:center
By the time I'm done with you,
I'll make it so you choose

00:18:42.163 --> 00:18:44.749 position:50% align:center
to leave the Order
of your own volition.

00:18:44.833 --> 00:18:45.917 position:50% align:center
[ALLEN]
I'd never!

00:18:46.001 --> 00:18:47.252 position:50% align:center
[MILLENNIUM EARL]
Don't ya get it?

00:18:47.335 --> 00:18:50.380 position:50% align:center
This little get together
is your going away party!

00:18:52.507 --> 00:18:55.093 position:50% align:center
Whoa. Who in the
hell is that guy?

00:18:55.176 --> 00:18:57.053 position:50% align:center
Alma Karma.

00:18:57.137 --> 00:19:00.390 position:50% align:center
He's the progenitor
of us Thirds.

00:19:00.473 --> 00:19:02.475 position:50% align:center
He was once like Yu Kanda.

00:19:02.559 --> 00:19:05.228 position:50% align:center
A test subject for
Artificial Apostles.

00:19:05.311 --> 00:19:06.354 position:50% align:center
[ALLEN]
What?

00:19:06.438 --> 00:19:07.439 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:19:08.314 --> 00:19:10.025 position:50% align:center
Wait, what? Who's he?

00:19:10.108 --> 00:19:11.484 position:50% align:center
[MILLENNIUM EARL]
Uh...

00:19:11.568 --> 00:19:12.861 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Hm?

00:19:12.944 --> 00:19:15.280 position:50% align:center
[MILLENNIUM EARL] I'm sorry.
What did you just say?

00:19:15.363 --> 00:19:18.533 position:50% align:center
[KANDA]
You heard me, who is that?

00:19:18.616 --> 00:19:20.910 position:50% align:center
What, am I supposed
to know him?

00:19:20.994 --> 00:19:23.079 position:50% align:center
[MILLENNIUM EARL, SHERYL]
What's happening here, Wisely?

00:19:23.163 --> 00:19:26.166 position:50% align:center
[WISELY] Hey, don't go
trying to lay this on me.

00:19:26.249 --> 00:19:28.626 position:50% align:center
It's weird, I admit.

00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:31.504 position:50% align:center
[gasps] No, wait a minute!

00:19:31.588 --> 00:19:33.048 position:50% align:center
No, it can't be...

00:19:33.131 --> 00:19:36.343 position:50% align:center
It's like Kanda doesn't even
recognize Alma anymore?

00:19:36.426 --> 00:19:38.887 position:50% align:center
No, that can't be it.

00:19:38.970 --> 00:19:41.556 position:50% align:center
There's no way he
could forget him.

00:19:41.639 --> 00:19:43.933 position:50% align:center
[ROAD] Are you just
pretending to be stupid?

00:19:44.017 --> 00:19:45.852 position:50% align:center
That's the Alma!

00:19:45.935 --> 00:19:49.814 position:50% align:center
Y'know, the failure you failed
to kill nine years ago?

00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:55.612 position:50% align:center
I didn't fail, he died.

00:19:55.695 --> 00:19:58.740 position:50% align:center
[ROAD]
Yet here he is, still kickin'.

00:19:58.823 --> 00:20:03.995 position:50% align:center
Well, comatose and a lab rat,
and the Order hid it from you.

00:20:04.079 --> 00:20:05.997 position:50% align:center
You wanna get ripped apart?

00:20:06.081 --> 00:20:08.875 position:50% align:center
[ROAD] They led you to believe
you killed Alma Karma,

00:20:08.958 --> 00:20:11.461 position:50% align:center
and then stuffed him away.

00:20:11.544 --> 00:20:13.171 position:50% align:center
For nine whole years,

00:20:13.254 --> 00:20:16.299 position:50% align:center
all in the name of their
crusade against the Noah.

00:20:16.383 --> 00:20:18.176 position:50% align:center
If you want the gory details,

00:20:18.259 --> 00:20:21.304 position:50% align:center
they fused his body with the
nucleus of the Akuma Egg,

00:20:21.388 --> 00:20:25.350 position:50% align:center
turning him into a living doll
to be devoured by the Order!

00:20:29.604 --> 00:20:31.231 position:50% align:center
[ROAD]
I don't understand.

00:20:31.314 --> 00:20:34.442 position:50% align:center
Aren't you happy to see
that Alma's alive?

00:20:34.526 --> 00:20:36.945 position:50% align:center
Maybe it's got something to
do with the one who got

00:20:37.028 --> 00:20:40.365 position:50% align:center
between you two. Didn't you
kill him over a woman?

00:20:40.448 --> 00:20:41.533 position:50% align:center
[KANDA gasps]

00:20:43.076 --> 00:20:44.577 position:50% align:center
[ALLEN]
Calm down, Kanda.

00:20:44.661 --> 00:20:48.248 position:50% align:center
You know an attack like this
doesn't work on Road.

00:20:49.749 --> 00:20:51.710 position:50% align:center
Don't let her provoke you.

00:20:51.793 --> 00:20:55.255 position:50% align:center
They've got some plan in
mind to try to use you.

00:20:55.338 --> 00:20:56.923 position:50% align:center
Keep it together!

00:20:57.007 --> 00:20:58.508 position:50% align:center
[ROAD]
Fine, have it your way!

00:20:58.591 --> 00:21:01.011 position:50% align:center
If you can't get it through
your skull that that's Alma,

00:21:01.094 --> 00:21:04.472 position:50% align:center
I guess Alma's gonna have
to convince you himself!

00:21:05.557 --> 00:21:09.019 position:50% align:center
[WISELY] I gave you fair warning
when we met, Yu Kanda.

00:21:09.102 --> 00:21:09.978 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:21:10.061 --> 00:21:11.438 position:50% align:center
We need your brain.

00:21:11.521 --> 00:21:15.608 position:50% align:center
It's the only way that we
can awaken Alma Karma.

00:21:15.692 --> 00:21:17.944 position:50% align:center
Don't look at him! Walker!

00:21:18.028 --> 00:21:19.446 position:50% align:center
Kanda!

00:21:23.908 --> 00:21:26.953 position:50% align:center
[ALMA]
Hey. Can you hear me?

00:21:28.663 --> 00:21:31.624 position:50% align:center
Please tell me
you're finally awake.

00:21:31.708 --> 00:21:33.126 position:50% align:center
[ALLEN]
Uh...

00:21:33.209 --> 00:21:36.379 position:50% align:center
[ALMA] If you're awake,
raise up your hand.

00:21:36.463 --> 00:21:38.548 position:50% align:center
[ALLEN]
Who is he?

00:21:41.259 --> 00:21:43.595 position:50% align:center
Uh! You did it!

00:21:44.512 --> 00:21:46.222 position:50% align:center
[ALMA]
All right, all right!

00:21:46.306 --> 00:21:47.682 position:50% align:center
I'm so happy!

00:21:47.766 --> 00:21:50.101 position:50% align:center
I was afraid that I
was the only one!

00:21:50.185 --> 00:21:53.938 position:50% align:center
[ALLEN] Okay. I guess he's
not talking to me, then.

00:21:54.022 --> 00:21:57.317 position:50% align:center
Where am I?
What is this place?

00:21:57.400 --> 00:22:00.862 position:50% align:center
They already told me
that your name is Yu.

00:22:00.945 --> 00:22:02.072 position:50% align:center
[ALLEN]
Huh?

00:22:04.449 --> 00:22:05.992 position:50% align:center
Who, me?

00:22:06.076 --> 00:22:08.036 position:50% align:center
Sorry, I'm kinda shy.

00:22:08.119 --> 00:22:10.330 position:50% align:center
But, well... My name...

00:22:10.413 --> 00:22:12.290 position:50% align:center
They call me Alma.

00:22:12.374 --> 00:22:13.458 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:22:13.541 --> 00:22:15.543 position:50% align:center
[ALMA]
Happy birthday, Yu!

00:22:17.295 --> 00:22:18.922 position:50% align:center
[ALLEN]
Hold on a sec!

00:22:19.005 --> 00:22:20.840 position:50% align:center
Where am I?

00:22:22.217 --> 00:22:24.552 position:50% align:center
[ALLEN]
What? No way!

00:22:24.636 --> 00:22:26.096 position:50% align:center
Kanda?

00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:45.633 position:50% align:center
[KANDA] Alma and I
were created as part of

00:23:45.717 --> 00:23:48.261 position:50% align:center
the Second Exorcists
Plan nine years ago.

00:23:48.345 --> 00:23:51.723 position:50% align:center
We endured the cruel
daily experiments.

00:23:51.806 --> 00:23:53.767 position:50% align:center
Until I saw the illusion.

00:23:53.850 --> 00:23:57.187 position:50% align:center
Next time, Night 6: "Friend."
