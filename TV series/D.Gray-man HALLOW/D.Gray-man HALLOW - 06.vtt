[KANDA]
And there it was.

00:00:15.265 --> 00:00:17.976 position:50% align:center
Right before my eyes.

00:00:18.059 --> 00:00:21.312 position:50% align:center
The vast and beautiful blue sky.

00:00:22.355 --> 00:00:25.316 position:50% align:center
I knew. Just like I thought.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.820 position:50% align:center
[KANDA]
It was blue.

00:00:28.903 --> 00:00:31.614 position:50% align:center
As far as the eye could see.

00:00:31.698 --> 00:00:34.117 position:50% align:center
I'd never seen the sky before.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.285 position:50% align:center
And yet...

00:00:35.368 --> 00:00:39.289 position:50% align:center
[KANDA]
I'm so... sorry, Alma.

00:00:39.914 --> 00:00:43.084 position:50% align:center
[KANDA] I had known it
for my entire life.

00:00:43.168 --> 00:00:46.338 position:50% align:center
Since my very first breath.

00:02:18.054 --> 00:02:20.181 position:50% align:center
[ALMA]
Happy birthday, Yu!

00:02:20.265 --> 00:02:21.558 position:50% align:center
[ALLEN]
What's happening?

00:02:21.641 --> 00:02:23.935 position:50% align:center
Where the hell am I?

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:26.646 position:50% align:center
Tell the Branch Chief
the second one is awake!

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.064 position:50% align:center
And prepare the medication.

00:02:28.148 --> 00:02:28.940 position:50% align:center
Hurry!

00:02:29.024 --> 00:02:29.983 position:50% align:center
[LAB MEMBER 6A]
Yes, sir!

00:02:30.066 --> 00:02:32.819 position:50% align:center
Dr. Edgar! We need
to dry him off!

00:02:32.902 --> 00:02:33.945 position:50% align:center
Give him your coat!

00:02:34.029 --> 00:02:36.573 position:50% align:center
Alma. You'll freeze
in those clothes.

00:02:36.656 --> 00:02:38.033 position:50% align:center
[ALMA]
I'm fine, just hurry!

00:02:38.116 --> 00:02:39.200 position:50% align:center
[ALLEN]
What's going on...?

00:02:39.284 --> 00:02:40.535 position:50% align:center
[ALMA]
Are you cold?

00:02:40.618 --> 00:02:41.411 position:50% align:center
Yu?

00:02:41.494 --> 00:02:42.704 position:50% align:center
[ALLEN]
Wait, Yu?

00:02:42.787 --> 00:02:44.039 position:50% align:center
Is that kid...?

00:02:44.122 --> 00:02:45.915 position:50% align:center
[ROAD]
Well, this got weird.

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:49.002 position:50% align:center
Looks like we got caught in the
crossfire of Kanda's brainwaves.

00:02:49.085 --> 00:02:51.546 position:50% align:center
Why're you here, Road?!

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:54.549 position:50% align:center
[TOKUSA]
Hey, Kanda! Allen Walker!

00:02:54.632 --> 00:02:56.551 position:50% align:center
What did you monsters
do to them?

00:02:56.634 --> 00:02:58.845 position:50% align:center
[WISELY]
Jeez, stop screeching.

00:02:58.928 --> 00:03:02.307 position:50% align:center
I'm just tinkering with Yu
Kanda's brain, it's very minor.

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.559 position:50% align:center
Looks like you grabbed
Road's brain, too.

00:03:04.642 --> 00:03:06.186 position:50% align:center
Not to mention the boy.

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:09.189 position:50% align:center
Wisely doesn't concern
himself with precision.

00:03:09.272 --> 00:03:11.024 position:50% align:center
Shut up, onlookers.

00:03:11.107 --> 00:03:13.443 position:50% align:center
Two Exorcists awakened
nine years ago,

00:03:13.526 --> 00:03:17.614 position:50% align:center
and from that moment, you will
rise again, Alma Karma.

00:03:17.697 --> 00:03:19.908 position:50% align:center
The past that is lost
to you still exists

00:03:19.991 --> 00:03:22.243 position:50% align:center
within Yu Kanda's memories.

00:03:22.327 --> 00:03:25.497 position:50% align:center
And through his memories,
you will find your own.

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.667 position:50% align:center
I will give back what
was stolen from you.

00:03:30.001 --> 00:03:32.629 position:50% align:center
[ZU] My god, they're
trying to wake him up.

00:03:32.712 --> 00:03:34.297 position:50% align:center
[ZU]
No! Please, don't!

00:03:34.381 --> 00:03:35.799 position:50% align:center
Leave him alone!

00:03:35.882 --> 00:03:38.218 position:50% align:center
I'm begging you, don't wake him!

00:03:38.301 --> 00:03:39.636 position:50% align:center
They won't listen to you.

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:41.304 position:50% align:center
[ZU]
Please! Leave him be!

00:03:41.388 --> 00:03:43.807 position:50% align:center
Just let him sleep!

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.226 position:50% align:center
Save your breath, old master.

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:48.520 position:50% align:center
Have you forgotten
that we're Noah?

00:03:48.603 --> 00:03:51.356 position:50% align:center
We have no mercy to offer you.

00:03:52.691 --> 00:03:53.900 position:50% align:center
[EDGAR]
Enough!

00:03:53.983 --> 00:03:56.111 position:50% align:center
Cut it out, both of you!

[screams]

00:03:58.863 --> 00:04:00.115 position:50% align:center
Holy crap.

00:04:00.198 --> 00:04:02.617 position:50% align:center
The two of you need to
calm down, take a breath.

00:04:02.701 --> 00:04:04.369 position:50% align:center
I don't like that look.

00:04:04.452 --> 00:04:06.621 position:50% align:center
[LAB MEMBERS whimper]

00:04:06.705 --> 00:04:08.748 position:50% align:center
He's a demon!
There's a demon in him!

[EDGAR]
Yu, calm down!

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:14.170 position:50% align:center
Yu! You threw me full
force, didn't you?

C'mon, enough already!

00:04:21.344 --> 00:04:24.681 position:50% align:center
[TUI]
Seriously? Another fight?

00:04:24.764 --> 00:04:26.266 position:50% align:center
How badly are they hurt?

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:29.519 position:50% align:center
[EDGAR] Well, they're
completely healed now.

00:04:29.602 --> 00:04:31.479 position:50% align:center
[TUI] Their healing powers
shouldn't be an excuse

00:04:31.563 --> 00:04:32.564 position:50% align:center
for brawling.

00:04:32.647 --> 00:04:34.983 position:50% align:center
True. [laughs]

00:04:35.066 --> 00:04:38.069 position:50% align:center
Too bad the ones who break up
their fights can't regenerate.

00:04:38.153 --> 00:04:40.905 position:50% align:center
You're my husband, and I
love you, but you are a wimp.

00:04:40.989 --> 00:04:42.407 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, Tui.

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.242 position:50% align:center
I'm a terrible assistant,
aren't I?

00:04:44.325 --> 00:04:45.952 position:50% align:center
But you might want to
take into account

00:04:46.036 --> 00:04:48.246 position:50% align:center
how insanely
strong they are.

00:04:49.164 --> 00:04:50.790 position:50% align:center
This is a serious matter.

00:04:50.874 --> 00:04:52.250 position:50% align:center
It's not good.

00:04:52.334 --> 00:04:55.378 position:50% align:center
You seem to have no control
over your emotions lately.

00:04:55.462 --> 00:04:58.882 position:50% align:center
You must remember that you two
exist to save the human race.

00:04:58.965 --> 00:05:01.009 position:50% align:center
Act like the Apostle you are.

00:05:01.092 --> 00:05:03.345 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, Doctor Sahlins.

00:05:03.428 --> 00:05:06.264 position:50% align:center
I... just wanted to
spend time with Yu.

00:05:06.348 --> 00:05:08.224 position:50% align:center
You are so damn creepy!

00:05:08.308 --> 00:05:11.019 position:50% align:center
Quit stalking me! Do me
a favor and just die!

00:05:15.523 --> 00:05:17.484 position:50% align:center
I wonder where Kanda
even learned to use

00:05:17.567 --> 00:05:18.735 position:50% align:center
such harsh language.

I was born in a grave.

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:30.372 position:50% align:center
A world of darkness with no sky.

Asian Research Laboratory 6.

00:05:35.835 --> 00:05:39.339 position:50% align:center
A place where every action
was made in service to God,

00:05:39.422 --> 00:05:43.218 position:50% align:center
including my birth, and the
reason assigned to my existence.

00:05:43.301 --> 00:05:44.928 position:50% align:center

So all of these holes...?

00:05:45.011 --> 00:05:46.179 position:50% align:center
[EDGAR]
That's right.

00:05:46.262 --> 00:05:49.391 position:50% align:center
The other Apostles like
you are asleep in them.

00:05:49.474 --> 00:05:51.267 position:50% align:center
Are humans made this way?

00:05:51.351 --> 00:05:52.769 position:50% align:center
Born out of holes like this?

Uh! Uh, no.

00:05:55.438 --> 00:05:58.900 position:50% align:center
You see, human babies are born
from their mother's womb.

Their mothers?

00:06:00.318 --> 00:06:02.028 position:50% align:center
And what are they?

Oh. Well.

00:06:03.738 --> 00:06:07.200 position:50% align:center
A mother is a woman and
when she loves a man,

they make a human
baby together.

00:06:09.244 --> 00:06:12.038 position:50% align:center

[RENNY] I should've known
he was following Kanda.

00:06:37.939 --> 00:06:41.317 position:50% align:center
Uh. I didn't follow.

he would greet the other
