[MILLENNIUM EARL]
Why, you ask?

00:07:54.099 --> 00:07:57.560 position:50% align:center
[MILLENNIUM EARL]
Well, to be by his side.

00:07:57.644 --> 00:07:59.354 position:50% align:center
Because the only thing I want

00:07:59.437 --> 00:08:02.232 position:50% align:center
is to be by the
Fourteenth's side.

00:08:03.525 --> 00:08:05.151 position:50% align:center
He got all gooey
saying he wanted

00:08:05.235 --> 00:08:08.571 position:50% align:center
to be by the Fourteenth's side.

00:08:08.655 --> 00:08:09.989 position:50% align:center
I'm jealous, here.

You're throwing out these
sexy smiles for the Earl.

00:08:13.326 --> 00:08:16.287 position:50% align:center
But I guess you've got a pretty
good idea of how he feels.

00:08:16.371 --> 00:08:20.208 position:50% align:center
I mean, you've been by his
side for several decades.

00:08:20.291 --> 00:08:22.002 position:50% align:center
Here's the thing, Road.

00:08:22.085 --> 00:08:25.338 position:50% align:center
We've sworn our loyalty
to Lord Millennium.

00:08:25.422 --> 00:08:28.049 position:50% align:center
So we follow his orders
without question.

00:08:28.133 --> 00:08:31.302 position:50% align:center
And we never doubt
our assigned roles.

00:08:31.386 --> 00:08:32.637 position:50% align:center
But still...

00:08:32.721 --> 00:08:35.849 position:50% align:center
That doesn't mean we don't
have our own feelings.

00:08:35.932 --> 00:08:39.227 position:50% align:center
And we want to understand
what he's going through.

00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:40.895 position:50% align:center
So I take it that
the Earl didn't

00:08:40.979 --> 00:08:43.815 position:50% align:center
invite us here himself.

I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

00:08:46.067 --> 00:08:49.738 position:50% align:center

falling asleep, you see.

00:08:49.821 --> 00:08:50.947 position:50% align:center
It's been some time.

00:08:51.031 --> 00:08:53.116 position:50% align:center
That's an accurate
thing to say, right?

00:08:53.199 --> 00:08:54.534 position:50% align:center
Road filled me in.

00:08:54.617 --> 00:08:56.453 position:50% align:center
According to her, you were
friendly with the previous

00:08:56.536 --> 00:09:00.248 position:50% align:center
generation of Noah
until 35 years ago.

00:09:00.331 --> 00:09:02.625 position:50% align:center
Old... Old man.

00:09:02.709 --> 00:09:04.586 position:50% align:center
[SHERYL] She even surprised
us with the revelation

00:09:04.669 --> 00:09:07.255 position:50% align:center
that you shared a connection
with the Fourteenth.

00:09:07.339 --> 00:09:09.257 position:50% align:center
You what?

00:09:09.341 --> 00:09:11.217 position:50% align:center
[chuckles] Now I see.

00:09:11.301 --> 00:09:13.762 position:50% align:center
The Earl has ordered the lot
of you to welcome the traitor

00:09:13.845 --> 00:09:15.805 position:50% align:center
who murdered you
with wide open arms.

00:09:15.889 --> 00:09:18.683 position:50% align:center
And, understandably, you're
scared out of your wits.

00:09:18.767 --> 00:09:20.226 position:50% align:center
So let me guess.

00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:23.396 position:50% align:center
You're hoping I can tell you
whatever his weakness might be.

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:25.648 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:09:25.732 --> 00:09:28.526 position:50% align:center
As if we could ever possibly
welcome him to join us.

00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:29.778 position:50% align:center
We're going to return the favor

00:09:29.861 --> 00:09:32.530 position:50% align:center
and kill him the
first chance we get.

00:09:32.614 --> 00:09:33.948 position:50% align:center
And yet...

00:09:34.032 --> 00:09:36.034 position:50% align:center
Here is Lord Millennium,
demanding that we protect him

00:09:36.117 --> 00:09:38.745 position:50% align:center
from the Heart, even at
the cost of our own lives.

00:09:38.828 --> 00:09:40.413 position:50% align:center
But why?

00:09:40.497 --> 00:09:42.248 position:50% align:center
The Earl looked
downright lovesick,

00:09:42.332 --> 00:09:44.000 position:50% align:center
standing there in front
of him, proclaiming

00:09:44.084 --> 00:09:46.670 position:50% align:center
that he wants to be by his side!

00:09:46.753 --> 00:09:48.296 position:50% align:center
So what do I care?

00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:49.923 position:50% align:center
I want to know
everything possible

00:09:50.006 --> 00:09:51.508 position:50% align:center
about the Fourteenth.

00:09:51.591 --> 00:09:53.593 position:50% align:center
And I plan to scour
every last Bookmen's

00:09:53.677 --> 00:09:57.180 position:50% align:center
memories you have,
one by one, to find out.

00:09:59.557 --> 00:10:00.934 position:50% align:center
[SHERYL]
Oh, right.

00:10:01.017 --> 00:10:03.812 position:50% align:center
Don't forget that Feedra's
parasitic Poaz are swimming

00:10:03.895 --> 00:10:07.315 position:50% align:center
around inside your junior
there, as well as Chaozii.

Walker hasn't answered a
single one of our questions.

Perhaps a harsher
tactic is in order.

With all due respect, sir.

00:12:12.148 --> 00:12:14.109 position:50% align:center

I asked Jerry to make
this porridge for you.

00:17:59.788 --> 00:18:01.956 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:04.000 position:50% align:center
As cautious as you've
been, he specially

00:18:04.084 --> 00:18:06.961 position:50% align:center
prepared it so you'd know
that it's safe to eat.

00:18:07.045 --> 00:18:09.756 position:50% align:center
The Central Agency
had zero involvement

00:18:09.839 --> 00:18:13.093 position:50% align:center
in its preparation. So eat it!

00:18:17.138 --> 00:18:20.225 position:50% align:center
[ALLEN] "Lvellie's a shit"?
Sounds like Jerry.

00:18:20.308 --> 00:18:21.267 position:50% align:center
Wow, Link.

00:18:21.351 --> 00:18:23.228 position:50% align:center
I'm surprised you're
okay with this.

00:18:31.152 --> 00:18:32.654 position:50% align:center
[ALLEN]
Hey, Link.

00:18:32.737 --> 00:18:35.699 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry that I blamed you
for what happened to Tokusa.

00:18:38.201 --> 00:18:42.414 position:50% align:center
[LINK] You finally break your
stubborn vow of silence...

00:18:42.497 --> 00:18:44.666 position:50% align:center
...and that's what you say?!

00:18:54.634 --> 00:18:57.929 position:50% align:center

They were like my family.

[gasps]

00:19:05.729 --> 00:19:08.565 position:50% align:center
[LINK] We were all orphans,
and we got to know each other

00:19:08.648 --> 00:19:11.526 position:50% align:center
while begging at
the same churches.

00:19:11.609 --> 00:19:14.779 position:50% align:center
Tewaku and Kiredori were
the youngest of the group.

00:19:14.863 --> 00:19:17.532 position:50% align:center
So we banded together
to look after them.

00:19:19.409 --> 00:19:23.288 position:50% align:center
[LINK] In order to survive,
we let the church take us in.

00:19:23.371 --> 00:19:27.292 position:50% align:center
But it didn't take long before
we became Central's puppets.

[LINK] If anyone needs
to atone for the Thirds,

00:19:34.257 --> 00:19:35.842 position:50% align:center
it's me.

00:19:35.925 --> 00:19:37.510 position:50% align:center
I'm the one...

00:19:40.388 --> 00:19:43.683 position:50% align:center
[LINK] ...who retrieved the
Dark Matter for the Director.

00:19:53.276 --> 00:19:57.113 position:50% align:center
[sighs] Oh, man,
I am such an idiot.

00:19:59.532 --> 00:20:01.868 position:50% align:center
I wish I'd known that.

00:20:01.951 --> 00:20:05.580 position:50% align:center
Maybe I wouldn't have been
such a jerk to the Thirds.

00:20:05.663 --> 00:20:08.833 position:50% align:center
The fact that they chose
to become half-Akuma...

00:20:09.959 --> 00:20:14.047 position:50% align:center
...well, I couldn't help but
kind of hate them for that.

00:20:14.130 --> 00:20:15.965 position:50% align:center
If I had only known,

00:20:16.049 --> 00:20:18.927 position:50% align:center
I might've done
things differently.

00:20:19.010 --> 00:20:20.929 position:50% align:center
I mean, who knows,
but maybe even

00:20:21.012 --> 00:20:23.848 position:50% align:center
Kanda and Alma
would've survived.

00:20:25.183 --> 00:20:28.853 position:50% align:center
Ignorance is-- It's
really terrible, huh?

00:20:36.569 --> 00:20:38.530 position:50% align:center
[ALLEN]
I get it now.

00:20:38.613 --> 00:20:41.157 position:50% align:center
All I've done is
hate the Fourteenth.

00:20:41.241 --> 00:20:45.787 position:50% align:center
And I know nothing
about him. Nothing at all.

00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:47.747 position:50% align:center
The one thing I do know

00:20:47.831 --> 00:20:50.417 position:50% align:center
is that he was Mana's
younger brother.

00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:52.502 position:50% align:center
Why did he betray the Noah?

00:20:52.585 --> 00:20:56.673 position:50% align:center
And why does he want to
become the Millennium Earl?

00:20:56.756 --> 00:21:00.176 position:50% align:center
If I knew, could I possibly
change the direction

00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:02.220 position:50% align:center
of the course we're on?

00:21:05.223 --> 00:21:05.932 position:50% align:center

Hey, Walker!

[ALLEN gasps]

00:21:13.773 --> 00:21:15.066 position:50% align:center
I feel--

00:21:16.693 --> 00:21:19.154 position:50% align:center
[ALLEN]
What is this? Why do I...?

00:21:19.237 --> 00:21:21.698 position:50% align:center
Walker! What's happening?

00:21:21.781 --> 00:21:22.699 position:50% align:center

I feel hot.

Answer me! Walker! Walker!

00:21:28.455 --> 00:21:32.876 position:50% align:center

My consciousness is fading away.

00:21:32.959 --> 00:21:35.503 position:50% align:center
[CARDINAL 10A]
Don't let him fall asleep.

00:21:35.587 --> 00:21:38.006 position:50% align:center
It'll be the end
for him if he does.

00:21:38.089 --> 00:21:41.843 position:50% align:center
If he sinks too far, Allen
will disappear completely.

00:21:41.926 --> 00:21:43.928 position:50% align:center
What? Ca-Cardinal?

00:21:44.012 --> 00:21:45.513 position:50% align:center
What're you doing here?

00:21:47.057 --> 00:21:48.391 position:50% align:center
[CARDINAL 10A]
Don't worry.

00:21:48.475 --> 00:21:51.394 position:50% align:center
I'll heal you now, my child.

00:21:51.478 --> 00:21:53.980 position:50% align:center

happened to the guards?

You have everyone worried

00:21:56.483 --> 00:21:58.068 position:50% align:center
about you, Allen.

[wheezing]

00:22:00.779 --> 00:22:02.697 position:50% align:center
And none of them are
more worried about you

00:22:02.781 --> 00:22:04.115 position:50% align:center
than the Heart.

00:22:05.784 --> 00:22:07.494 position:50% align:center

The Cardinal attacks Allen.

00:23:45.675 --> 00:23:49.637 position:50% align:center
He's neither human, nor
an Innocence Accommodator.

00:23:49.721 --> 00:23:52.432 position:50% align:center
A clue to the Heart
has finally surfaced.

00:23:52.515 --> 00:23:55.602 position:50% align:center
Next time: Night 11,
"Hidden One."
