[CROSS]
So, Allen...

00:00:11.886 --> 00:00:13.763 position:50% align:center
I've been wondering
for some time,

00:00:13.847 --> 00:00:16.516 position:50% align:center
do you like Timcanpy?

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:19.144 position:50% align:center
I asked you to look
after him for me,

00:00:19.227 --> 00:00:23.231 position:50% align:center
but it was always my intention
to give him to you.

00:00:23.314 --> 00:00:25.066 position:50% align:center
[ALLEN]
It was so brief.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.111 position:50% align:center
Just a simple audio recording.

00:00:28.194 --> 00:00:30.113 position:50% align:center
But I discovered the
message he left for me

00:00:30.196 --> 00:00:32.449 position:50% align:center
shortly after that rainy day.

00:00:32.532 --> 00:00:35.368 position:50% align:center
[CROSS] It's time to walk
on your own, Allen.

00:00:35.452 --> 00:00:39.289 position:50% align:center
Wearing Mana's mask isn't
doing you any good.

00:00:48.465 --> 00:00:51.343 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasping]

00:00:51.426 --> 00:00:54.679 position:50% align:center
Bishop to... D-3.

00:00:54.763 --> 00:00:56.431 position:50% align:center
I'm really sorry, Miranda.

00:00:56.514 --> 00:00:58.892 position:50% align:center
We drained the barrier
device's battery.

00:00:58.975 --> 00:01:01.311 position:50% align:center
We had no idea this
would take so long.

00:01:01.394 --> 00:01:02.812 position:50% align:center
No. It's all right.

00:01:02.896 --> 00:01:05.648 position:50% align:center
You two try to take a break
while there's time.

00:01:05.732 --> 00:01:08.276 position:50% align:center
As long as I've got this
trivial power of mine,

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.945 position:50% align:center
I'll do what I can
to keep us safe!

00:01:11.029 --> 00:01:13.406 position:50% align:center
Oh, lord! Please don't
let that thing kill me!

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.785 position:50% align:center
[AKUMA 1A] Hand over
the innocence, right now!

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.246 position:50% align:center
Sorry, but that's not happening.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:21.623 position:50% align:center
Don't interfere!

00:01:21.706 --> 00:01:25.502 position:50% align:center
[AKUMA 1A] What?! You're
the ones that're in my way!

00:01:26.878 --> 00:01:28.296 position:50% align:center
[AKUMA 1A groans]

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.423 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:01:33.802 --> 00:01:35.720 position:50% align:center
She warned you.

00:01:37.222 --> 00:01:41.309 position:50% align:center
Nice. The Black Order's elite,
taking care of business.

00:01:43.603 --> 00:01:45.438 position:50% align:center
Fire Stamp!

00:01:47.357 --> 00:01:49.234 position:50% align:center
[MONSTERS groan]

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:52.362 position:50% align:center
What's the hold up?!
Just finish the game!

00:01:52.445 --> 00:01:56.449 position:50% align:center
Madam... Could you please
not distract me right now?

00:01:56.991 --> 00:01:58.451 position:50% align:center
[AKUMA 1B]
Quit scampering!

00:01:58.535 --> 00:02:01.955 position:50% align:center
Damn Exorcists are
getting on my nerves!

00:02:02.038 --> 00:02:03.873 position:50% align:center
[AKUMA 1C]
Look at that flimsy sword.

00:02:03.957 --> 00:02:05.709 position:50% align:center
I'll snap it in two!

00:02:05.792 --> 00:02:08.086 position:50% align:center
[KANDA]
Heh. You'll break Mugen?

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:10.714 position:50% align:center
It'll be fun to see you try.

00:02:10.797 --> 00:02:13.383 position:50% align:center
Nigen Swords...

00:02:13.466 --> 00:02:14.843 position:50% align:center
Eight-Flower...

00:02:14.926 --> 00:02:16.428 position:50% align:center
...Mantis Slicer!

00:02:16.511 --> 00:02:18.805 position:50% align:center
[AKUMA 1C groans]

00:02:18.888 --> 00:02:22.392 position:50% align:center
[AKUMA 1B growls]
I'm gonna kill you, you worm!

00:02:22.475 --> 00:02:23.226 position:50% align:center
[KANDA grunts]

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:25.228 position:50% align:center
[AKUMA 1B groans]

00:02:27.313 --> 00:02:29.190 position:50% align:center
Pawn, E-5.

00:02:29.274 --> 00:02:31.818 position:50% align:center
[AKUMA 1D]
Quit blockin' me out!

00:02:33.778 --> 00:02:35.113 position:50% align:center
Are we gonna be okay?

00:02:35.196 --> 00:02:37.490 position:50% align:center
Uh, my energy's low,
but I guess so?

00:02:37.574 --> 00:02:38.867 position:50% align:center
[KIE, MAOSA]
Huh?

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.662 position:50% align:center
[AKUMA 1D] Damn you!
You moth-eaten, spinster Bitch!

00:02:42.746 --> 00:02:44.831 position:50% align:center
Damn! Damn! Damn!

00:02:46.583 --> 00:02:47.625 position:50% align:center
[AKUMA 1D]
Huh?

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:49.669 position:50% align:center
The language you're
spewing forth...

00:02:49.753 --> 00:02:53.423 position:50% align:center
That is unquestionably
no way to speak to a lady.

00:02:53.506 --> 00:02:56.051 position:50% align:center
You can apologize by dying!

00:02:56.134 --> 00:02:57.969 position:50% align:center
[AKUMA 1D groans]

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:00.388 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:03:00.472 --> 00:03:04.517 position:50% align:center
[OLD LADY 1A] Oh, my heart.
I'm about to die of fright!

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:09.689 position:50% align:center
Bring forth salvation
to this Akuma's soul.

00:03:09.773 --> 00:03:11.608 position:50% align:center
You and your sympathy.

00:03:11.691 --> 00:03:14.361 position:50% align:center
You're softer
than an old pillow.

00:03:14.444 --> 00:03:17.030 position:50% align:center
Akuma are just
hijacked human souls.

00:03:17.113 --> 00:03:19.199 position:50% align:center
What's wrong with having
compassion for them?

00:03:19.282 --> 00:03:20.492 position:50% align:center
Aw, shove it!

00:03:20.575 --> 00:03:22.494 position:50% align:center
Hey! How's the game going?

00:03:22.577 --> 00:03:24.537 position:50% align:center
If you've lost, I'll kill you.

00:03:24.621 --> 00:03:28.291 position:50% align:center
[MIRANDA] Y-You don't have
to be so aggressive, Kanda.

00:03:28.375 --> 00:03:30.335 position:50% align:center
[LINK]
Checkmate!

00:03:30.418 --> 00:03:32.087 position:50% align:center
[MIRANDA, MAOSA, KIE]
He did it!

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:33.880 position:50% align:center
I can't believe you
made me do this,

00:03:33.963 --> 00:03:37.509 position:50% align:center
I'm just an Inspector!
I am not an Exorcist.

00:03:37.592 --> 00:03:39.803 position:50% align:center
You might as well pitch in.

00:03:39.886 --> 00:03:41.346 position:50% align:center
That's mate, Mr. Martin.

00:03:41.429 --> 00:03:43.098 position:50% align:center
We won the game.

00:03:43.181 --> 00:03:45.225 position:50% align:center
We'll be taking your ring now.

00:03:45.308 --> 00:03:47.727 position:50% align:center
Some champion you've
turned out to be.

00:03:47.811 --> 00:03:50.313 position:50% align:center
Haunting this graveyard
to play chess.

00:03:50.397 --> 00:03:51.523 position:50% align:center
My dumb brother.

00:03:51.606 --> 00:03:55.026 position:50% align:center
Heh. But hey, that was
a great final match.

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.154 position:50% align:center
C'mon, you've played enough now.

00:04:07.622 --> 00:04:09.874 position:50% align:center
We've got it. The innocence.

00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:11.251 position:50% align:center
[GOLEM COMMUNICATION]
Well done.

00:04:11.334 --> 00:04:13.837 position:50% align:center
You're ordered to rendezvous
at the new Headquarters.

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:14.921 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Roger!

00:05:47.555 --> 00:05:50.558 position:50% align:center
[LENALEE] Are you trying to
catch a cold out here, Allen?

00:05:50.642 --> 00:05:53.228 position:50% align:center
It's nice and cozy
inside, y'know.

00:05:53.311 --> 00:05:57.899 position:50% align:center
Well, I guess I'm excited
about our new HQ and all.

00:05:57.982 --> 00:06:00.360 position:50% align:center
[LAVI] Yeah, I know,
we finally get to see it.

00:06:00.443 --> 00:06:03.029 position:50% align:center
After an endless
series of missions.

00:06:03.113 --> 00:06:04.531 position:50% align:center
The Black Order
really doesn't mind

00:06:04.614 --> 00:06:06.324 position:50% align:center
workin' us like dogs, do they?

00:06:06.408 --> 00:06:08.326 position:50% align:center
Ha, ha. It's not their fault.

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:10.912 position:50% align:center
They just don't have enough
Exorcists right now.

00:06:10.995 --> 00:06:12.455 position:50% align:center
Who's moved in so far?

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:14.457 position:50% align:center
The top brass and
the Science Section?

00:06:14.541 --> 00:06:17.794 position:50% align:center
Yep. I heard the space is
larger and more comfortable.

00:06:17.877 --> 00:06:19.963 position:50% align:center
Yeah? Nice.

00:06:20.046 --> 00:06:22.716 position:50% align:center
Maybe the dining
hall's bigger, too.

00:06:22.799 --> 00:06:24.300 position:50% align:center
See?

00:06:24.801 --> 00:06:25.969 position:50% align:center
What?

00:06:26.052 --> 00:06:28.638 position:50% align:center
Oh, well. We were talking
about you inside.

00:06:28.722 --> 00:06:30.932 position:50% align:center
That's right. There's
something different now.

00:06:31.016 --> 00:06:33.226 position:50% align:center
You've gotten a lot more
casual around us lately.

00:06:33.309 --> 00:06:34.227 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:36.229 position:50% align:center
What, you haven't noticed?

00:06:36.312 --> 00:06:38.231 position:50% align:center
And I thought it was
intentional. [laughs]

00:06:38.314 --> 00:06:40.108 position:50% align:center
Well, nothin' slips past me.

00:06:40.191 --> 00:06:43.153 position:50% align:center
It's my job as a bookman
to record everything.

00:06:43.236 --> 00:06:46.990 position:50% align:center
And not even the trivial details
get past my trained eye.

00:06:47.073 --> 00:06:47.991 position:50% align:center
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:06:48.074 --> 00:06:50.076 position:50% align:center
What? I like it.

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:51.870 position:50% align:center
You're talking to us
like we're friends.

00:06:51.953 --> 00:06:54.164 position:50% align:center
Huh? I guess I am...

00:06:54.247 --> 00:06:56.791 position:50% align:center
Your cheeks are turnin'
as red as your hand.

00:06:56.875 --> 00:06:59.002 position:50% align:center
[ALLEN]
Oh. C'mon, don't be like that.

00:06:59.085 --> 00:07:00.712 position:50% align:center
There it is!

00:07:04.758 --> 00:07:06.092 position:50% align:center
[LAVI]
Hell yeah!

00:07:06.176 --> 00:07:09.512 position:50% align:center
Our new home!
Hurry up this boat!

00:07:09.596 --> 00:07:11.431 position:50% align:center
[LENALEE]
Don't get too excited, Lavi.

00:07:11.514 --> 00:07:12.682 position:50% align:center
[ALLEN]
No, it's great.

00:07:12.766 --> 00:07:14.893 position:50% align:center
He can use that energy
to carry all our stuff.

00:07:14.976 --> 00:07:16.603 position:50% align:center
[LAVI]
I'm not carryin' your stuff!

00:07:16.686 --> 00:07:18.355 position:50% align:center
[ALLEN] Ha, ha! Well,
you're already carrying

00:07:18.438 --> 00:07:20.523 position:50% align:center
the weight of the
world's history, so...

00:07:21.941 --> 00:07:25.362 position:50% align:center
[LENALEE] Here it is, the new
Headquarters of the Black Order.

00:07:25.445 --> 00:07:27.572 position:50% align:center
We recently moved out
of our old HQ.

00:07:27.655 --> 00:07:31.284 position:50% align:center
And this is our first
time stepping inside.

00:07:31.368 --> 00:07:34.621 position:50% align:center
For over a century now, we
Exorcists of the Black Order

00:07:34.704 --> 00:07:37.999 position:50% align:center
have been locked into a Holy War
against the malevolent Akuma.

00:07:38.083 --> 00:07:40.710 position:50% align:center
A pernicious type of
paranormal weapon created

00:07:40.794 --> 00:07:44.297 position:50% align:center
from tormented human souls
by the Millennium Earl.

00:07:45.173 --> 00:07:46.800 position:50% align:center
[LENALEE]
The Black Order recently stole

00:07:46.883 --> 00:07:49.803 position:50% align:center
two of the Millennium Earl's
most powerful instruments:

00:07:49.886 --> 00:07:54.265 position:50% align:center
the Akuma Egg and the Ark
created by the clan of Noah.

00:07:54.349 --> 00:07:58.144 position:50% align:center
This led to an all-out battle
with Noah's descendants.

00:07:58.228 --> 00:08:02.190 position:50% align:center
We were able to foil their plot
in the end, but at a great cost.

00:08:02.273 --> 00:08:03.775 position:50% align:center
The lives of our comrades

00:08:03.858 --> 00:08:06.027 position:50% align:center
and the destruction
of our Headquarters.

00:08:06.111 --> 00:08:09.155 position:50% align:center
We may have won,
but we lost plenty as well.

00:08:09.239 --> 00:08:12.450 position:50% align:center
[ALLEN] So this is
where we'll be living.

00:08:12.534 --> 00:08:13.618 position:50% align:center
[door creaks]

00:08:13.702 --> 00:08:15.412 position:50% align:center
[LENALEE]
Wow, look at this place!

00:08:15.495 --> 00:08:17.455 position:50% align:center
[LAVI]
No kidding! This is nuts!

00:08:17.539 --> 00:08:18.790 position:50% align:center
Welcome back!

00:08:18.873 --> 00:08:20.542 position:50% align:center
No, I mean, welcome home!

00:08:20.625 --> 00:08:22.836 position:50% align:center
[LAVI]
This place is a full-on mansion!

00:08:22.919 --> 00:08:23.795 position:50% align:center
It's lovely!

00:08:23.878 --> 00:08:25.672 position:50% align:center
It's got a lot more space.

00:08:25.755 --> 00:08:28.383 position:50% align:center
Pretty impressive considering
how quickly they built it.

00:08:28.466 --> 00:08:31.219 position:50% align:center
It's so magnificent.
I feel out of place.

00:08:31.302 --> 00:08:32.262 position:50% align:center
Yeah, me too.

00:08:32.345 --> 00:08:33.680 position:50% align:center
[KANDA exhales]

00:08:33.763 --> 00:08:37.642 position:50% align:center
Try not to get so worked up
over a new building.

00:08:37.726 --> 00:08:39.310 position:50% align:center
Just how are we "worked up"?

00:08:39.394 --> 00:08:42.439 position:50% align:center
Huh? Well you're loud,
for starters.

00:08:42.522 --> 00:08:43.898 position:50% align:center
You should be more considerate!

00:08:43.982 --> 00:08:45.442 position:50% align:center
Oh, really?

00:08:45.525 --> 00:08:49.070 position:50% align:center
It sounds like you're the only
one raising his voice here.

00:08:49.154 --> 00:08:50.321 position:50% align:center
[MIRANDA]
I'm the adult.

00:08:50.405 --> 00:08:52.449 position:50% align:center
I should try to
intervene somehow!

00:08:52.532 --> 00:08:55.326 position:50% align:center

completely different people,

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:58.246 position:50% align:center
how could I possibly
make them get along?

00:08:58.329 --> 00:09:01.041 position:50% align:center
Oh! Uh. That's right!

00:09:02.417 --> 00:09:05.295 position:50% align:center
Allen! You want
some candy? Kanda?

00:09:05.378 --> 00:09:06.629 position:50% align:center
Sure, thanks!

00:09:06.713 --> 00:09:07.505 position:50% align:center
No way.

[ALLEN gasping]

00:09:09.174 --> 00:09:10.633 position:50% align:center
Uh. Allen?

00:09:10.717 --> 00:09:12.927 position:50% align:center
Sorry, I know you must be tired,

00:09:13.011 --> 00:09:15.180 position:50% align:center
but could you help
us with the gates?

00:09:15.263 --> 00:09:17.557 position:50% align:center
Of course! Not a problem.

00:09:26.733 --> 00:09:29.736 position:50% align:center
Ah, great. It's cold
in this place.

00:09:31.613 --> 00:09:35.075 position:50% align:center
Heya, geezer. How's it goin'?

00:09:35.158 --> 00:09:37.327 position:50% align:center
I take it you've been
working diligently?

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:39.079 position:50% align:center
Course I have. But, hey.

00:09:39.162 --> 00:09:42.415 position:50% align:center
I thought you were
arriving tomorrow?

00:09:42.499 --> 00:09:45.752 position:50% align:center
Well, I can't neglect
my main job, can I?

00:09:47.504 --> 00:09:50.006 position:50% align:center
You're getting the hang
of connecting these gates.

00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:53.134 position:50% align:center
I mean, you can't move
the ark for noth-- Uh...

00:09:53.218 --> 00:09:54.469 position:50% align:center
It's pretty simple.

00:09:54.552 --> 00:09:56.680 position:50% align:center
I recite the lyrics in my head.

00:09:56.763 --> 00:09:59.265 position:50% align:center
It's just too bad I can't
open gates in places

00:09:59.349 --> 00:10:01.142 position:50% align:center
I've never been before.

00:10:01.226 --> 00:10:03.603 position:50% align:center
Well, I know the move
from the old Headquarters

00:10:03.687 --> 00:10:05.689 position:50% align:center
is gonna be a breeze,
thanks to you.

Allen Walker.

[ALLEN growls]

00:10:26.543 --> 00:10:28.586 position:50% align:center
[LVELLIE] Your body
probably feels a bit heavy,

00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:30.588 position:50% align:center
but it won't cause you any harm.

00:10:30.672 --> 00:10:31.715 position:50% align:center
The spell is only meant

00:10:31.798 --> 00:10:33.883 position:50% align:center
to restrain your left
arm, that's all.

00:10:33.967 --> 00:10:35.093 position:50% align:center
That's all?!

00:10:35.176 --> 00:10:37.512 position:50% align:center
You could've let me
change clothes first!

00:10:37.595 --> 00:10:40.098 position:50% align:center
You can still manage
with one arm.

00:10:41.474 --> 00:10:44.561 position:50% align:center
[ALLEN] To think that they'd go
this far when I'm one of them.

00:10:44.644 --> 00:10:46.688 position:50% align:center
But of course. They're
still suspicious

00:10:46.771 --> 00:10:49.441 position:50% align:center

actually with them or not.

[ALLEN]
Uh!

00:12:02.347 --> 00:12:04.641 position:50% align:center
[LAVI] The Central Agency's

00:12:07.519 --> 00:12:11.523 position:50% align:center

How long has it been

00:12:23.326 --> 00:12:24.744 position:50% align:center
since you've seen your master,

00:12:24.828 --> 00:12:27.956 position:50% align:center
and that's the first
thing you want to say?

00:12:28.039 --> 00:12:29.290 position:50% align:center
But, yes.

00:12:29.374 --> 00:12:32.794 position:50% align:center
The Fourteenth had a
full-blooded older brother.

00:12:32.877 --> 00:12:35.797 position:50% align:center
Only one person continued to
stand by the Fourteenth's side

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:37.757 position:50% align:center
after he betrayed the Noah Clan,

00:12:37.841 --> 00:12:40.844 position:50% align:center
up until the Millennium
Earl killed him.

00:12:40.927 --> 00:12:43.847 position:50% align:center
And that person was Mana Walker.

00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:47.892 position:50% align:center
You're saying...
Mana was his brother?

00:12:47.976 --> 00:12:50.061 position:50% align:center
And you knew?! All this time?!

00:12:50.145 --> 00:12:51.646 position:50% align:center
Of course I did.

00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:55.734 position:50% align:center
You see, I promised the
Fourteenth before he died--

00:12:55.817 --> 00:12:57.694 position:50% align:center
A mutual pact of sorts.

00:12:57.777 --> 00:13:01.823 position:50% align:center
I swore to watch over
Mana for him.

00:13:01.906 --> 00:13:04.451 position:50% align:center
I made this promise
because in exchange,

00:13:04.534 --> 00:13:06.619 position:50% align:center
you made a promise to me.

00:13:06.703 --> 00:13:09.998 position:50% align:center
That you would return to
Mana one day, Allen.

00:13:11.916 --> 00:13:15.712 position:50% align:center

you the Fourteenth?

Wow. It's still raining.

00:13:25.138 --> 00:13:28.475 position:50% align:center
Right? I know. Personally,
I don't like rain.

00:13:28.558 --> 00:13:31.686 position:50% align:center
It always makes me feel
all somber and gloomy.

00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:33.271 position:50% align:center
[LENALEE]
Yeah.

00:13:33.355 --> 00:13:35.648 position:50% align:center
I wonder if Allen's okay.

00:13:35.732 --> 00:13:38.943 position:50% align:center
Can't shake the bad feeling
I've got about this.

00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:42.947 position:50% align:center
Have you noticed it?

00:13:43.031 --> 00:13:44.741 position:50% align:center
You must have started
to feel the existence

00:13:44.824 --> 00:13:47.327 position:50% align:center
of the Fourteenth
within you. Allen?

00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:49.079 position:50% align:center
What?! What're you saying?!

00:13:49.162 --> 00:13:51.915 position:50% align:center
Don't play stupid. You knew
the pianist's song

00:13:51.998 --> 00:13:54.125 position:50% align:center
that could control
the Ark, didn't you?

00:13:54.209 --> 00:13:58.588 position:50% align:center
That knowledge belonged
to the Fourteenth.

00:13:58.672 --> 00:14:00.340 position:50% align:center
The memories of the
Fourteenth have been

00:14:00.423 --> 00:14:02.258 position:50% align:center
implanted inside you, Allen.

00:14:02.342 --> 00:14:06.721 position:50% align:center
He intends to use you to
return to this world.

00:14:06.805 --> 00:14:08.306 position:50% align:center
And he will.

00:14:08.390 --> 00:14:10.392 position:50% align:center

I'm gettin' outta this place
as soon as I'm old enough.

00:14:48.138 --> 00:14:49.556 position:50% align:center
So I don't need any friends.

00:14:49.639 --> 00:14:50.640 position:50% align:center
Really? That so?

00:14:50.724 --> 00:14:51.474 position:50% align:center
Ya mean it? Really?

00:14:51.558 --> 00:14:52.892 position:50% align:center

You telling me
that wasn't funny?

00:14:55.478 --> 00:14:56.688 position:50% align:center
It wasn't funny.

00:14:56.771 --> 00:14:58.606 position:50% align:center
Sorry, but I don't
really like clowns.

00:14:58.690 --> 00:15:00.150 position:50% align:center
In fact, I hate them.

So, what was his name?

00:15:28.303 --> 00:15:32.849 position:50% align:center
I pet him yesterday.
And he licked my hand.

I mean, I have some idea.

Probably sometime shortly

00:16:19.854 --> 00:16:23.733 position:50% align:center
[grunts] Yeah, well,
I didn't fully believe it.

00:16:23.817 --> 00:16:26.611 position:50% align:center
Not until you
showed up, that is.

00:16:26.695 --> 00:16:29.739 position:50% align:center
After the Fourteenth
tried to kill the Earl,

00:16:29.823 --> 00:16:32.200 position:50% align:center
his life was a living hell.

00:16:32.283 --> 00:16:34.577 position:50% align:center
He and Mana were
constantly on the run,

00:16:34.661 --> 00:16:37.330 position:50% align:center
all while fighting
the Noah Clan.

00:16:37.414 --> 00:16:39.624 position:50% align:center
That kind of life, well...

00:16:39.708 --> 00:16:43.169 position:50% align:center
There was no time.
He couldn't carefully decide.

00:16:43.253 --> 00:16:45.130 position:50% align:center
When he did choose
his next host,

00:16:45.213 --> 00:16:48.466 position:50% align:center
first chance he had, he picked
the person closest to him.

00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:50.427 position:50% align:center
That's how badly he
wants to kill the Earl

00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:51.803 position:50% align:center
with his own hands.

00:16:51.886 --> 00:16:54.681 position:50% align:center
So that's... me?

00:16:54.764 --> 00:16:56.891 position:50% align:center
It was nothing but bad luck.

00:16:56.975 --> 00:16:58.351 position:50% align:center
Over the course of time,

00:16:58.435 --> 00:17:00.603 position:50% align:center
the implanted memories
will consume you.

00:17:00.687 --> 00:17:04.107 position:50% align:center
You will eventually
become the Fourteenth.

00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:05.608 position:50% align:center
You must've noticed the signs.

00:17:05.692 --> 00:17:08.528 position:50% align:center
[ALLEN whimpers]

00:17:08.611 --> 00:17:11.322 position:50% align:center
So that's what... that was.

00:17:11.406 --> 00:17:14.659 position:50% align:center
That's what's going on.

00:17:14.743 --> 00:17:16.870 position:50% align:center
Mana told me that he loved me.

00:17:16.953 --> 00:17:19.998 position:50% align:center
But did he? Or was it just--

00:17:22.459 --> 00:17:26.421 position:50% align:center
Mana started to act strangely
the day the Fourteenth died.

00:17:26.504 --> 00:17:30.216 position:50% align:center
I was only observing
him as an outsider.

00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:33.845 position:50% align:center
So I don't even know if
he remembered the past.

00:17:33.928 --> 00:17:35.722 position:50% align:center
You have to believe me.

00:17:35.805 --> 00:17:37.390 position:50% align:center
I genuinely wish

00:17:37.474 --> 00:17:40.518 position:50% align:center
that the Fourteenth had
picked anyone else.

00:17:41.811 --> 00:17:44.314 position:50% align:center
[CROSS]
Once you become the Fourteenth--

00:17:44.397 --> 00:17:46.358 position:50% align:center
you'll have no choice
but to kill someone

00:17:46.441 --> 00:17:48.068 position:50% align:center
that you care about.

00:17:48.151 --> 00:17:50.695 position:50% align:center
What would you do
if I told you that?

00:17:52.322 --> 00:17:54.949 position:50% align:center
[ALLEN]
Wait. Hold on!

00:17:55.033 --> 00:17:57.243 position:50% align:center
I'll kill someone I care about?

00:17:57.327 --> 00:17:58.953 position:50% align:center
Tell me what you mean!

00:17:59.037 --> 00:18:00.705 position:50% align:center
Master!

00:18:01.581 --> 00:18:03.583 position:50% align:center
[CROSS]
Ask the Fourteenth!

00:18:03.667 --> 00:18:06.294 position:50% align:center
There's more to this war
than we can see.

00:18:06.378 --> 00:18:08.838 position:50% align:center
Don't go dying again
before it ends.

00:18:08.922 --> 00:18:10.090 position:50% align:center
[CROW]
Your time is up.

00:18:10.173 --> 00:18:11.383 position:50% align:center
Please leave the room.

00:18:11.466 --> 00:18:12.884 position:50% align:center
I'm aware of that!
Shut your mouth!

00:18:12.967 --> 00:18:14.344 position:50% align:center
[ALLEN]
Master, wait!

00:18:14.427 --> 00:18:15.512 position:50% align:center
[CROW 1A]
This meeting is over.

00:18:15.595 --> 00:18:17.972 position:50% align:center
What?! You can't just leave!

00:18:18.056 --> 00:18:19.891 position:50% align:center
Not after telling me that!

00:18:19.974 --> 00:18:22.102 position:50% align:center
Did you hear me? Hey!

00:18:22.185 --> 00:18:24.979 position:50% align:center
I said wait, you dumb jerk!

00:18:26.231 --> 00:18:27.982 position:50% align:center
[CROW]
Please leave, General!

00:18:28.066 --> 00:18:29.526 position:50% align:center
You wanna say that
again to my face?!

00:18:29.609 --> 00:18:33.071 position:50% align:center
Listen. When I joined
the Black Order,

00:18:33.154 --> 00:18:35.365 position:50% align:center
I made a pledge that
I wouldn't stop.

00:18:35.448 --> 00:18:37.826 position:50% align:center
I vowed to Mana that
I would keep walking

00:18:37.909 --> 00:18:40.120 position:50% align:center
until the day I die.

00:18:40.203 --> 00:18:42.247 position:50% align:center
I'm the one who
made that vow!

00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:45.041 position:50% align:center
And yeah, maybe... Maybe
I was being controlled

00:18:45.125 --> 00:18:48.211 position:50% align:center
by the Fourteenth's memories,
but I don't know that!

00:18:48.294 --> 00:18:50.839 position:50% align:center
And to be honest,
I also don't even know

00:18:50.922 --> 00:18:53.842 position:50% align:center
what to think of Mana right now.

00:18:53.925 --> 00:18:55.385 position:50% align:center
But I still love him!

00:18:55.468 --> 00:18:57.721 position:50% align:center
Even after what you've said!

00:18:57.804 --> 00:19:00.223 position:50% align:center
I know that these
feelings are mine!

00:19:00.306 --> 00:19:02.809 position:50% align:center
They belong to me,
and no one else!

00:19:02.892 --> 00:19:04.227 position:50% align:center
And because of that,

00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:07.188 position:50% align:center
I will fulfill my vow
by my own will!

00:19:07.272 --> 00:19:09.399 position:50% align:center
That's my decision!

00:19:09.482 --> 00:19:11.651 position:50% align:center
I don't care about
the Fourteenth!

00:19:11.735 --> 00:19:16.322 position:50% align:center
Nothing will stop me!
I will honor my vow to Mana!

00:19:25.707 --> 00:19:27.375 position:50% align:center
[LENALEE]
Allen?

00:19:27.459 --> 00:19:30.086 position:50% align:center
Uh. Where are all the others?

00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:33.840 position:50% align:center
Oh. They're still talking with
the Director and his people.

00:19:33.923 --> 00:19:36.176 position:50% align:center
Hey, your face is all swollen.

00:19:36.259 --> 00:19:39.220 position:50% align:center
[ALLEN]
Yeah. My master kinda hit me.

00:19:39.304 --> 00:19:41.097 position:50% align:center
Huh? Are you okay?

00:19:41.181 --> 00:19:42.807 position:50% align:center
[ALLEN]
Mm-hm.

00:19:42.891 --> 00:19:44.517 position:50% align:center
[LENALEE]
Is he?

00:19:46.394 --> 00:19:48.646 position:50% align:center
It was no big deal.

00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:51.858 position:50% align:center
[ALLEN]
I will honor my vow to Mana!

00:19:51.941 --> 00:19:54.569 position:50% align:center
Stupid, worthless Master!

00:19:55.904 --> 00:19:58.656 position:50% align:center
So that's how it all
played out, Chief.

00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:01.951 position:50% align:center
I can't imagine you're too
happy with the results.

00:20:02.035 --> 00:20:05.163 position:50% align:center
The Fourteenth has one
goal--to kill the Earl.

00:20:05.246 --> 00:20:07.332 position:50% align:center
We have the same target.

00:20:07.415 --> 00:20:09.167 position:50% align:center
He's not the enemy!

00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:11.419 position:50% align:center
Well, now, that rather
depends on why

00:20:11.503 --> 00:20:14.923 position:50% align:center
the Fourteenth wants
to see the Earl dead.

00:20:15.006 --> 00:20:18.510 position:50% align:center
Just because we share a common
objective, it doesn't come close

00:20:18.593 --> 00:20:21.680 position:50% align:center
to ruling out the possibility
that he's evil.

00:20:21.763 --> 00:20:23.431 position:50% align:center
There's no guarantee
that he won't

00:20:23.515 --> 00:20:25.141 position:50% align:center
turn against us in the long run.

00:20:25.225 --> 00:20:27.185 position:50% align:center
[KOMUI growls]

00:20:27.268 --> 00:20:29.437 position:50% align:center
[LAVI] There's no point
trying to defend Allen.

00:20:29.521 --> 00:20:30.563 position:50% align:center
The Central Agency

00:20:30.647 --> 00:20:33.566 position:50% align:center
has officially decided
he's dangerous.

00:20:34.567 --> 00:20:36.069 position:50% align:center
[LAVI]
Hey, Old Man.

00:20:36.152 --> 00:20:39.447 position:50% align:center
The General said there was more
to this war than we could see.

00:20:39.531 --> 00:20:42.117 position:50% align:center
What do you think
he meant by that?

00:20:42.867 --> 00:20:44.452 position:50% align:center
[LAVI]
Old Man...?

00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:47.414 position:50% align:center
Time to go. Lavi.

00:20:47.497 --> 00:20:48.540 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:20:48.623 --> 00:20:49.958 position:50% align:center
[BOOKMAN]
Until I tell you otherwise,

00:20:50.041 --> 00:20:52.293 position:50% align:center
you stash that info
deep in your head.

00:20:52.377 --> 00:20:56.131 position:50% align:center
Don't tell anyone
about it. Understand?

00:20:58.967 --> 00:21:01.761 position:50% align:center
[LVELLIE] I'll be summoning the
Order's officers and Exorcists,

00:21:01.845 --> 00:21:04.806 position:50% align:center
including Allen Walker, in
order to announce the details

00:21:04.889 --> 00:21:07.434 position:50% align:center
of how he's to be dealt with.

00:21:07.517 --> 00:21:08.476 position:50% align:center
"Dealt with"?

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:10.812 position:50% align:center
Is that decision from the Pope?

00:21:12.147 --> 00:21:14.232 position:50% align:center
You have a good night now.

00:21:14.315 --> 00:21:16.276 position:50% align:center

00:21:20.321 --> 00:21:22.365 position:50% align:center
Thank you for watching
over the meeting for me.

[CROW]
Yes, sir.

00:21:23.324 --> 00:21:25.452 position:50% align:center
You should know--Cross Marian.

00:21:25.535 --> 00:21:29.080 position:50% align:center
He appeared to pass something to
the Golem during the meeting.

00:21:29.164 --> 00:21:30.915 position:50% align:center
What would you like me to do?

00:21:30.999 --> 00:21:33.126 position:50% align:center
[LVELLIE sighs]

00:21:33.209 --> 00:21:36.963 position:50% align:center
I trust your judgment.
Continue the investigation.

00:21:37.047 --> 00:21:39.466 position:50% align:center
Understood, Inspector Link?

00:21:39.549 --> 00:21:41.092 position:50% align:center
[LINK]
Yes sir.

00:21:53.355 --> 00:21:56.191 position:50% align:center
The kid's really
grown a backbone.

00:21:56.274 --> 00:21:57.692 position:50% align:center
Nice to know.

00:21:57.776 --> 00:22:01.154 position:50% align:center
Sending him off to the Order
wasn't a bad call after all.

Just who attacked my Master?

Before I can get to
the bottom of it,

00:23:46.718 --> 00:23:49.512 position:50% align:center
I have another assignment
to deal with in Paris.

with a series of phantom thefts.
