[SCHNEIDER]
Admiral, what are fighting for?

159
00:09:46,983 --> 00:09:49,400
Tell me, for who's sake
are we fighting them?

160

Stop it.

00:09:51,692 --> 00:09:53,608
All you or I can do
at this point is defend

00:09:53,692 --> 00:09:56,108
our honor as soldiers.

164
00:09:56,192 --> 00:09:57,275
Nothing more.

[SCHNEIDER sighs]

166
00:10:01,983 --> 00:10:03,317
[MITTERMEYER]
I apologize, sir.

167
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,983
Staden was able to escape me.

168
00:10:06,067 --> 00:10:07,983
[REINHARD] No matter. Our
goal was to put a damper

169
00:10:08,067 --> 00:10:11,067
on their spirits,
and we achieved that.

170
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:12,650
We know where
they fled when they left

171
00:10:12,733 --> 00:10:14,275
the Altena Starzone.

172
00:10:14,358 --> 00:10:17,067
Staden lead his fleet to
the Rentenberg Fortress,

173
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:19,942
which is a key location
on the front lines.

174
00:10:20,025 --> 00:10:21,358
The strength of
its garrison force

175
00:10:21,442 --> 00:10:23,608
should not be ignored.

176
00:10:23,692 --> 00:10:26,358
[REINHARD]
Hmm. Then here's the plan.

177
00:10:26,442 --> 00:10:28,650
We'll take Rentenberg Fortress

178
00:10:28,733 --> 00:10:32,233
and make it our bridgehead for
taking down Geiersburg.

Reuenthal. Mittermeyer.

180
00:10:34,608 --> 00:10:36,442
Occupy Rentenberg
and take control

181
00:10:36,525 --> 00:10:38,275
without doing any damage.

182
00:10:38,358 --> 00:10:39,567
[BOTH]
Sir!

183
00:11:20,733 --> 00:11:22,817
[OBERSTEIN] Rentenberg Fortress
gets all of its energy

184
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:26,442
from a power reactor
located in its center.

185
00:11:26,525 --> 00:11:30,483
The only way to get there is
via the number six passage.

186
00:11:30,567 --> 00:11:33,275
Once this reactor
is under our control,

187
00:11:33,358 --> 00:11:36,817
we will we be able to take over
all functions of the fortress.

188
00:11:39,608 --> 00:11:42,775
Looks like we'll have to
use hand-to-hand combat.

189
00:11:42,858 --> 00:11:44,608
It's not as simple
as they think.

190
00:11:44,692 --> 00:11:46,317
You can say that again.

191
00:11:55,067 --> 00:11:56,358
I can't say I'm surprised.

192
00:11:56,442 --> 00:11:58,692
They filled it with
Seffle particles.

193
00:11:58,775 --> 00:12:00,108
He's a barbarian.

194
00:12:00,192 --> 00:12:02,650
And he wants a primitive
fight to the death.

195
00:12:08,108 --> 00:12:11,650
Of course, he's Rentenberg's
defense commander.

196
00:12:11,733 --> 00:12:13,733
If it was anyone else,
it'd be easy.

for upwards of eight hours, now.

[REUENTHAL] It appears they're
using some kind of drug.

00:13:23,192 --> 00:13:25,233
I understand the situation.

Ovlesser may be courageous,
but he is also a Neanderthal.

If we let him live,
he'll be of no use,

he wouldn't want to be

kept alive at our mercy.

It's fine.

Hello, golden-haired brat!

228
00:13:49,733 --> 00:13:51,317
Do you have the guts
to look me in the eye,

229
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,150
even through a screen?

230

You may have been

but you've achieved nothing.

Now you want the Imperial Navy?

233
00:13:58,733 --> 00:14:01,983
I will never allow a child such
as yourself to control that!

234
00:14:02,067 --> 00:14:03,733
And the idea that
you'd take advantage

235
00:14:03,817 --> 00:14:05,650
of the emperor's
favor to monopolize

is outrageous!

Despite your lowly birth,

with sex, and your good looks!

is worthy of death!

316
00:18:11,692 --> 00:18:13,442
And Marquis Lohengramm
does not wish to see

317
00:18:13,525 --> 00:18:17,317
the Empire as a whole
grow fragile and weak.

318
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,567
We'd like for you to give us
a third option in resolving

319
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:22,567
this conflict, to help
us end it quickly.

320
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:25,067
Feh! Do you really think
there's a chance our leader

321
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:27,400
will agree to make peace now?

322
00:18:27,483 --> 00:18:29,692
If it comes from such
a distinguished warrior

323
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:33,192
as yourself, perhaps
even they will consider it.

324
00:18:35,067 --> 00:18:37,025
I understand what you're saying.

325
00:18:37,108 --> 00:18:39,983
But... If I do return
to Geiersburg,

326
00:18:40,067 --> 00:18:41,692
you realize you
have no guarantee

327
00:18:41,775 --> 00:18:43,900
that I'll do what
the brat wants.

328
00:18:50,233 --> 00:18:51,400
[OVLESSER sighs]

329
00:18:51,483 --> 00:18:55,233
You must be High Admiral
Ovlesser, am I correct?

330
00:18:55,317 --> 00:18:59,233
You can't tell just
by looking at me?

331
00:18:59,317 --> 00:19:00,483
Right this way.

332
00:19:00,567 --> 00:19:02,400
Our leader awaits you.

333
00:19:04,483 --> 00:19:06,400
High Admiral Ovlesser.

334
00:19:06,483 --> 00:19:08,692
You made it back in one piece.

335
00:19:08,775 --> 00:19:10,650
Sir!

336
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:13,108
Do you know what happened
to the rest of your men?

337
00:19:13,192 --> 00:19:14,483
Because interestingly enough,

338
00:19:14,567 --> 00:19:17,608
they were all captured
and publicly put to death.

339
00:19:17,692 --> 00:19:19,775
Wait, they were executed?

340
00:19:19,858 --> 00:19:22,275
[BRAUNSCHWEIG] Why then, I
wonder, were you the only one

341
00:19:22,358 --> 00:19:25,275
who was set free and
allowed to return here?

[OVLESSER growls]
Hold on.

344
00:19:32,233 --> 00:19:34,817
This must be a trap--the
golden-haired brat set this up

345
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,650
to trick every one of us!

346
00:19:36,733 --> 00:19:38,442
Silence, you traitor!

[OVLESSER gasps]

348
00:19:39,775 --> 00:19:41,900
You were the only one
to return alive because

349
00:19:41,983 --> 00:19:44,692
you obviously sold
yourself out to the enemy!

350
00:19:44,775 --> 00:19:46,400
Tell me, what did
you promise him?!

351
00:19:46,483 --> 00:19:49,275
That you would bring him my
severed head on a stake?!

352

That's not true!

00:19:50,608 --> 00:19:52,692
I have done nothing
to betray you!

354
00:19:52,775 --> 00:19:54,442
This is simply a trap!

355

As I said, the brat must have
set this up to trick us all!

What shall we say was
the cause of his demise?

We need an
official statement.

We'll call it what
it was, an execution.

377
00:21:02,692 --> 00:21:05,233
He betrayed his comrades
and was punished.

Make sure the
whole Empire knows!

This will foster agitation and
mistrust amongst the nobles.

From their perspective,
anyone could betray them.
