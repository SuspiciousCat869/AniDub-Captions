1
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:29,942
[ANNEROSE]
Sieg.

2
00:00:30,025 --> 00:00:32,525
I hope you'll be good friends
with my brother.

3
00:02:04,608 --> 00:02:06,900
[ANNEROSE]
It has been a while, Reinhard.

4
00:02:06,983 --> 00:02:09,317
I hope you are doing well.

5
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,275
Thanks to you, I have
been enjoying my days

6
00:02:12,358 --> 00:02:15,067
in peace and quiet.

7
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:16,525
The other afternoon,

8
00:02:16,608 --> 00:02:19,400
I baked a lovely
Kelsey plum cake.

9
00:02:19,483 --> 00:02:22,150
Just like the ones I would
make when you boys were young.

10
00:02:22,233 --> 00:02:24,150
The two of you
always sang my praises

11
00:02:24,233 --> 00:02:26,483
while happily eating away.

12
00:02:26,567 --> 00:02:28,358
How nostalgic.

13
00:02:28,442 --> 00:02:32,650
It was so long ago that it
almost seems like a dream.

14
00:02:32,733 --> 00:02:38,233
Sometimes, I wonder if
it was only my imagination.

15
00:02:38,317 --> 00:02:42,150
My dearest Reinhard,
don't ever forget to hold

16
00:02:42,233 --> 00:02:44,650
and appreciate those
things dear to you.

17
00:02:44,733 --> 00:02:48,067
Never let go of what's
important in your heart.

18
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:49,900
There may be moments
where you find it both

19
00:02:49,983 --> 00:02:52,525
difficult and bothersome,
but rather than take

20
00:02:52,608 --> 00:02:55,483
those things for granted,
cherish them while you can

21
00:02:55,567 --> 00:02:59,150
so you are not filled
with regret if they vanish.

22
00:02:59,233 --> 00:03:00,567
Speaking of which,

23
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:03,067
you have a friend
to lean and rely on.

24
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:07,150
Talk everything over with Sieg,
and listen to what he tells you.

25
00:03:07,233 --> 00:03:10,525
Please be sure to take good
care of yourself out there.

26
00:03:10,608 --> 00:03:13,650
I eagerly await the day
you both return home.

27
00:03:13,733 --> 00:03:15,233
Until we meet again.

28
00:03:16,775 --> 00:03:18,067
[beep]

29
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:20,733
[KIRCHEIS] High Admiral
Kircheis, requesting entry.

30
00:03:26,192 --> 00:03:28,692
Exemplary work out there--
welcome back.

31
00:03:28,775 --> 00:03:30,108
You must be spent.

32
00:03:30,192 --> 00:03:32,817
Shall I call for coffee
or for wine?

33
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:35,358
It's a shame we don't have
any of my sister's cake.

34
00:03:35,442 --> 00:03:37,900
[KIRCHEIS]
Reinhard. We need to talk.

35
00:03:43,775 --> 00:03:44,858
Go on.

36
00:03:44,942 --> 00:03:46,317
It's about Westerland.

37
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,150
And the two million citizens
who were massacred there.

38
00:03:50,942 --> 00:03:52,358
What about them?

39
00:03:52,442 --> 00:03:55,067
I've heard rumors
that you knew about this plan.

40
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:57,108
Yet you chose to play
politics and allowed them

41
00:03:57,192 --> 00:03:58,942
to carry it out.

42
00:03:59,025 --> 00:04:00,525
Is that the truth?

43
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:06,858
[KIRCHEIS] For what reason
did you seek supremacy?

44
00:04:06,942 --> 00:04:10,358
Was it not to establish a just
regime where true impartiality

45
00:04:10,442 --> 00:04:14,317
could exist, and abolish the old
ways of the Goldenbaum Dynasty?

46
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,733
I don't need to be hearing
such things from you.

47
00:04:16,817 --> 00:04:18,900
The nobles have been
doing as they please

48
00:04:18,983 --> 00:04:20,900
for nearly five centuries.

49
00:04:20,983 --> 00:04:23,567
Their inevitable fall
was bound to be messy.

50
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:26,150
Resistance and
bloodshed was expected.

51
00:04:26,233 --> 00:04:27,567
However...

52
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:30,150
Civilians were not
part of the nobility's debt.

53
00:04:30,233 --> 00:04:32,650
There was no reason
for their blood to be spilt.

54
00:04:32,733 --> 00:04:34,608
Without a liberated public
as it's foundation,

55
00:04:34,692 --> 00:04:36,650
the new order cannot stand.

56
00:04:36,733 --> 00:04:39,567
If you sacrifice
the people for political gain,

57
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:41,317
is it not the same as
digging out the ground

58
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,025
from under your own feet?

59
00:04:43,108 --> 00:04:45,317
I told you, I realize that!

60
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,108
[KIRCHEIS] When you
sacrifice innocent lives,

61
00:04:47,192 --> 00:04:49,442
you stain your hands with blood.

62
00:04:49,525 --> 00:04:51,192
And there's no amount
of flowery rhetoric

63
00:04:51,275 --> 00:04:53,567
that can ever wash it off.

64
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:55,817
Why would you deign
to stoop so low?

65
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,358
To dishonor yourself.

66
00:04:57,442 --> 00:05:00,108
For the sake of some
momentary advantage?

67
00:05:00,192 --> 00:05:03,192
I have had enough
of your lecturing!

68
00:05:03,275 --> 00:05:04,775
First of all, Kircheis,

69
00:05:04,858 --> 00:05:08,067
at what point did I request your
opinion regarding this matter?

70
00:05:09,275 --> 00:05:12,567
[REINHARD] I'm asking you,
when did I invite your input?

71
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:15,275
Apologies. I gave it unprompted.

72
00:05:15,358 --> 00:05:16,733
[REINHARD]
That's right.

73
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:20,025
You may share your opinions
only when I ask for them.

74
00:05:20,108 --> 00:05:22,400
What's done is done.
Leave it be.

75
00:05:22,483 --> 00:05:24,442
With all due respect, Reinhard.

76
00:05:24,525 --> 00:05:27,233
What the nobles did was
certainly unforgivable.

77
00:05:27,317 --> 00:05:28,567
That much is true.

78
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:31,025
But you chose
to turn a blind eye.

79
00:05:31,108 --> 00:05:33,317
Tell me, which of those
two is the greater sin?

80
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,067
Kircheis!

81
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:36,442
Yes, sir?

82
00:05:36,525 --> 00:05:38,358
Remind me, Admiral.

83
00:05:38,442 --> 00:05:40,900
What are you to me?

84
00:05:40,983 --> 00:05:43,817
I am nothing but
your faithful subordinate,

85
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,442
Your Excellency.

86
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:06,525
[NOBLE 22A sighs]
Another suicide?

87
00:06:07,358 --> 00:06:09,608
[NOBLE 22B] Many others
have been imprisoned.

88
00:06:09,692 --> 00:06:11,983
If only they'd surrendered.

89
00:06:12,067 --> 00:06:13,400
[NOBLE 22A]
But even if they had,

90
00:06:13,483 --> 00:06:17,108
would Marquis Lohengramm
have accepted them?

91
00:06:17,192 --> 00:06:19,317
[NOBLE 22C]
How could this have happened?

92
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,900
What was the
coalition leader thinking?

93
00:06:24,192 --> 00:06:26,358
[BRAUNSCHWEIG]
Nothing to worry about.

94
00:06:29,317 --> 00:06:30,983
If they did better
in that last skirmish,

95
00:06:31,067 --> 00:06:32,775
it was only because they
happened to have luck on

96
00:06:32,858 --> 00:06:35,817
their side.
Of course, the real battle

97
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,358
has yet to begin.

98
00:06:37,442 --> 00:06:39,942
Truer words have
never been spoken, Uncle!

99
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:41,608
[LANDSBERG]
And next time,

100
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:45,442
we'll give them the greatest
fight of the century!

101
00:06:45,525 --> 00:06:46,858
Very good.

102
00:06:46,942 --> 00:06:49,650
We'll destroy that golden-haired
brat once and for all.

103
00:06:49,733 --> 00:06:52,733
And then we'll make a goblet
out of his pathetic skull!

104
00:06:52,817 --> 00:06:54,358
[ALL]
Prosit!

105
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:59,525
[HILDA]
Since the fall of Westerland,

106
00:06:59,608 --> 00:07:02,900
distrust in Duke Braunschweig
has been growing exponentially.

107
00:07:02,983 --> 00:07:06,567
Both among the nobility
and the bureaucracy.

108
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:08,150
Additionally,
I fear Duke Lichtenlade

109
00:07:08,233 --> 00:07:09,942
is scheming something,
as he has been visiting

110
00:07:10,025 --> 00:07:12,608
with nobles throughout
the imperial capital.

111
00:07:12,692 --> 00:07:14,150
Please be careful.

112
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:15,983
I'll pray for your success.

113
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,400
[OBERSTEIN]
I would advise against giving

114
00:07:21,483 --> 00:07:23,650
Admiral Kircheis
special treatment.

115
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:28,025
[OBERSTEIN] His military
accomplishments are too great.

116
00:07:28,108 --> 00:07:29,692
It's true that his work
in subjugating

117
00:07:29,775 --> 00:07:32,650
the outlying starzones
was a considerable factor

118
00:07:32,733 --> 00:07:34,233
in our victory,

119
00:07:34,317 --> 00:07:38,275
allowing you soley to focus on
fighting the Noble's Coalition--

120
00:07:38,358 --> 00:07:39,900
However.

121
00:07:39,983 --> 00:07:43,275
To make him the vanguard in
the final battle on top of that.

122
00:07:43,358 --> 00:07:46,192
[REINHARD]
It's not "special treatment."

123
00:07:46,275 --> 00:07:48,358
If the universe
turned against me,

124
00:07:48,442 --> 00:07:51,108
Kircheis would remain
standing by my side.

125
00:07:51,192 --> 00:07:53,900
His support has
always been a constant.

126
00:07:53,983 --> 00:07:56,733
I've simply been rewarding
him for his loyalty.

127
00:07:56,817 --> 00:07:58,442
What's so wrong about that?

128
00:07:58,525 --> 00:07:59,983
Excellency.

129
00:08:00,067 --> 00:08:02,775
I trust you understand that
I am by no means suggesting that

130
00:08:02,858 --> 00:08:07,275
you purge, exile, or harm High
Admiral Kircheis in any way.

131
00:08:07,358 --> 00:08:10,817
But an organization does
not need a number two.

132
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,817
Regardless of their competence.

133
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:16,233
They are a detriment to the
balance of the entire group.

134
00:08:16,317 --> 00:08:18,400
A figure that could distract
from the men's loyalty

135
00:08:18,483 --> 00:08:21,192
to the number one
should not exist.

136
00:08:22,067 --> 00:08:23,192
I've heard enough.

137
00:08:23,275 --> 00:08:24,942
Stop badgering me.

138
00:08:26,983 --> 00:08:28,775
[OBERSTEIN] The Noble's
Coalition has been successfully

139
00:08:28,858 --> 00:08:30,900
cornered and our intel
has reason to believe

140
00:08:30,983 --> 00:08:33,525
an all-out attack
against us is imminent.

141
00:08:33,608 --> 00:08:35,275
In other words,
this will most likely be

142
00:08:35,358 --> 00:08:37,067
the final battle.

143
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:39,442
Regarding our strategy,

144
00:08:39,525 --> 00:08:41,858
I will now assign each of you
your role in this operation

145
00:08:41,942 --> 00:08:44,275
against the traitors.

146
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:46,192
High Admiral Siegfried Kircheis.

147
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:47,400
[KIRCHEIS]
Sir.

148
00:08:47,483 --> 00:08:48,817
[OBERSTEIN]
You are to serve as vanguard.

149
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,108
Your role in the impeding
battle will be crucial.

150
00:08:55,483 --> 00:08:58,025
There was something off
between the two of them today.

151
00:08:58,108 --> 00:08:59,900
Kircheis and the Marquis.

152
00:08:59,983 --> 00:09:01,942
During any other meeting, the
fleet admiral would've given

153
00:09:02,025 --> 00:09:04,483
Kircheis the orders himself.

154
00:09:04,567 --> 00:09:08,067
But Oberstein stepped in
and got involved this time.

155
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:10,358
The Chief of Staff doesn't seem
too fond of the fact that

156
00:09:10,442 --> 00:09:12,775
His Excellency defers to
Kircheis in both his public

157
00:09:12,858 --> 00:09:15,192
and personal life.

158
00:09:15,275 --> 00:09:16,650
Of course,

159
00:09:16,733 --> 00:09:19,025
it's not as though I don't
understand his frustration.

[ANSBACH]
My lord.

319
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,025
Is that you, Ansbach?

320
00:17:49,108 --> 00:17:50,900
I thought you were
still imprisoned!

321
00:17:50,983 --> 00:17:53,733
Forgive me, sir,
but my soldiers rescued me.

322
00:17:53,817 --> 00:17:55,942
What has become of my family?!

323
00:17:56,025 --> 00:17:57,442
They're all right.

324
00:17:57,525 --> 00:18:00,525
I have ensured their safe
passage to a secure location.

325
00:18:00,608 --> 00:18:02,025
Ah, very good.

326
00:18:02,108 --> 00:18:04,692
--I'll join them--
--[ANSBACH] Come with us, sir.

327
00:18:14,608 --> 00:18:17,442
[alarm blaring]

328
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:23,067
[sighs]
Well, here we are.

329
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:25,317
What exactly have you arranged?

330
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,608
My sincere condolences, sir.

331
00:18:27,692 --> 00:18:29,900
But given our current
set of circumstances,

332
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:32,275
I'm afraid you're left with
a difficult decision to make,

333
00:18:32,358 --> 00:18:33,900
Your Excellency.

334
00:18:33,983 --> 00:18:37,442
[BRAUNSCHWEIG] Hm. I suppose our
only choice is to broker peace.

335
00:18:37,525 --> 00:18:39,067
[ANSBACH]
You wish to negotiate?

336
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:42,150
Offering favorable
conditions, of course.

337
00:18:42,233 --> 00:18:43,983
I will give him
my daughter Elizabeth

338
00:18:44,067 --> 00:18:47,108
as an official gesture
of recognition.

339
00:18:47,192 --> 00:18:49,858
This would make him the late
kaiser's grandson by marriage,

340
00:18:49,942 --> 00:18:52,108
thereby giving him
the proper status to succeed

341
00:18:52,192 --> 00:18:54,192
as a rightful heir.

342
00:18:54,275 --> 00:18:55,858
[ANSBACH]
A futile suggestion.

343
00:18:55,942 --> 00:18:57,025
[gasps]

344
00:18:57,108 --> 00:18:59,108
That might have
worked months ago,

345
00:18:59,192 --> 00:19:01,692
but as of this moment,
Marquis Lohengramm clearly

346
00:19:01,775 --> 00:19:04,108
has no need of your assistance.

347
00:19:04,192 --> 00:19:06,067
[BRAUNSCHWEIG gasps]

348
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:09,108
[ANSBACH] He will rise to
power through his own merits.

349
00:19:09,192 --> 00:19:11,858
It's unlikely anyone
can stop him.

350
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:14,817
[BRAUNSCHWEIG]
I am Duke Otto von Braunschweig.

351
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:17,067
I'm the head of the most
prestigious elite family

352
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:19,025
in the whole of the Empire!

353
00:19:19,108 --> 00:19:20,733
Despite all that,
are you suggesting

354
00:19:20,817 --> 00:19:23,442
that golden- haired brat
means to kill me?

355
00:19:23,525 --> 00:19:25,317
That is the exact
reason he cannot

356
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,067
allow you to live.

357
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:29,108
You're an enemy to humanity.

358
00:19:29,192 --> 00:19:31,692
[BRAUNSCHWEIG]
Humanity? How so?

359
00:19:31,775 --> 00:19:34,067
I refer to Westerland of course.

360
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:36,400
I would hope you
hadn't forgotten already.

361
00:19:36,483 --> 00:19:38,650
[BRAUNSCHWEIG] Culling away
a few low-born peasants

362
00:19:38,733 --> 00:19:40,358
is hardly a crime!

363
00:19:40,442 --> 00:19:42,067
As both an aristocrat
and their ruler,

364
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:45,442
I was merely exercising
my god-given rights!

365
00:19:45,525 --> 00:19:48,567
[ANSBACH] Yes, the Galactic
Empire may have operated

366
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:50,775
under that mode of
logic for centuries.

367
00:19:50,858 --> 00:19:52,650
However, from now on,

368
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:55,067
that thinking is
going to die out.

369
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:58,817
For him to demonstrate that,
the Marquis has no choice.

370
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:01,567
He'll make sure
you die along with it.

371
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:04,650
[BRAUNSCHWEIG whimpers]

372
00:20:07,817 --> 00:20:09,608
Therefore,
as the last living leader

373
00:20:09,692 --> 00:20:11,692
of the Braunschweig family,

374
00:20:11,775 --> 00:20:14,942
I implore you to end
your reign with dignity.

375
00:20:15,025 --> 00:20:17,067
[rumbling]

376
00:20:19,067 --> 00:20:22,525
[BRAUNSCHWEIG sighs]
Very well, then.

377
00:20:22,608 --> 00:20:24,150
I shall pass with grace.

378
00:20:24,233 --> 00:20:26,275
However, I can't
bear to permit that

379
00:20:26,358 --> 00:20:28,900
golden-haired scoundrel
to usurp the throne!

380
00:20:28,983 --> 00:20:29,983
If I'm going to Hell,

381
00:20:30,067 --> 00:20:33,108
then I'm bringing that
bastard with me!

382
00:20:33,192 --> 00:20:35,525
Listen, Ansbach,
You must do whatever you can

383
00:20:35,608 --> 00:20:37,608
to stop him from
claiming the crown!

384
00:20:37,692 --> 00:20:39,275
If you can assure me that much,

385
00:20:39,358 --> 00:20:42,275
I'll take my own life without
any lingering regrets!

386
00:20:42,358 --> 00:20:45,692
Please, promise
you'll kill him for me!

387
00:20:45,775 --> 00:20:46,942
As you command.

388
00:20:47,025 --> 00:20:48,192
I swear it.

389
00:20:48,275 --> 00:20:51,192
I'll eradicate Marquis
Lohengramm at all costs.

390
00:20:51,275 --> 00:20:52,858
Thank you.

391
00:20:54,317 --> 00:20:57,067
All right.

392
00:20:57,150 --> 00:20:58,483
Be gentle.

393
00:20:58,567 --> 00:21:00,483
I don't want to feel any pain.

[ANSBACH]
Sir.

395
00:21:07,525 --> 00:21:09,233
You'll start to grow drowsy.

396
00:21:09,317 --> 00:21:11,358
And drift off into a deep sleep.

No! I refuse!

00:21:24,983 --> 00:21:28,400
I don't want to die after all!
I'll surrender to him!

401
00:21:28,483 --> 00:21:29,942
He can have
my title or my fortune,

402
00:21:30,025 --> 00:21:31,608
but not my life!
