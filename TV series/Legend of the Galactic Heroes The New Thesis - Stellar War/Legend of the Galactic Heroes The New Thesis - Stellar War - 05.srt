1
00:00:34,233 --> 00:00:36,192
According to the agenda,

2
00:00:36,275 --> 00:00:38,525
you have a lunch meeting
scheduled with Chairman Trunicht

3
00:00:38,608 --> 00:00:40,025
at 11 o'clock.

4
00:00:40,108 --> 00:00:41,692
Duly noted.

5
00:00:41,775 --> 00:00:43,108
[FALK]
Chief Cubersly!

6
00:00:45,525 --> 00:00:47,900
Commodore Falk. Good to see you.

7
00:00:49,525 --> 00:00:52,983
It's my understanding you took
a medical leave of absence.

8
00:00:53,067 --> 00:00:56,317
I've fully recovered.
I'm back to myself.

9
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:00,775
And with your help I'd like to
make my return to active duty.

10
00:01:00,858 --> 00:01:02,567
Your reinstatement?

11
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:04,567
And your doctor
already approved this?

12
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:07,525
Well, of course he already has,
that's why I'm here.

13
00:01:07,608 --> 00:01:09,900
He endorsed me without concern.

14
00:01:09,983 --> 00:01:11,108
I see.

15
00:01:11,192 --> 00:01:13,525
Then I suggest you
follow regulations.

16
00:01:13,608 --> 00:01:16,067
Just submit a formal request
and your doctor's note

17
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:17,650
to the defense committee.

18
00:01:17,733 --> 00:01:19,567
As you know,
they need to authorize it.

19
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:21,067
Going through official
channels is the--

20
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:23,775
Yes, but doing all of
that will take far too long.

21
00:01:23,858 --> 00:01:25,900
I'm ready to start today
and be of service again

22
00:01:25,983 --> 00:01:27,775
to our great nation.

23
00:01:27,858 --> 00:01:30,067
I'd trust you to remember
that standard procedures

24
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:32,817
always take some time
to process, Commodore.

25
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:35,608
Which is exactly why I hoped
that you could help me.

26
00:01:35,692 --> 00:01:37,733
[CUBERSLY] I'm afraid
you've misunderstood me.

27
00:01:37,817 --> 00:01:38,817
[FALK]
Ah...

28
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,233
Allow me to clarify.

29
00:01:40,317 --> 00:01:42,692
My job is to see that
protocol is followed.

30
00:01:42,775 --> 00:01:45,192
Not broken,
as you wish to believe.

31
00:01:45,275 --> 00:01:46,525
You seem to think
you're entitled

32
00:01:46,608 --> 00:01:48,983
to some sort of
special treatment.

33
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:51,358
But in my opinion,
it appears you're still in need

34
00:01:51,442 --> 00:01:53,525
of more rehabilitation.

35
00:01:53,608 --> 00:01:55,650
And in your current state,

36
00:01:55,733 --> 00:01:58,900
your lack of cooperation
would only promote confusion.

37
00:01:58,983 --> 00:02:02,067
That would be bad for you,
and certainly for everyone else.

38
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:05,150
Give it some time.
That's my advice.

39
00:02:05,233 --> 00:02:07,858
Pardon, sir, but we
should get going now.

40
00:02:07,942 --> 00:02:10,192
Of course. Good day, then.

41
00:02:15,442 --> 00:02:17,025
Heh...

42
00:02:19,733 --> 00:02:20,817
[WHITTY]
Watch out!

43
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,317
[CUBERSLY gasps]

44
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,108
[screams]

45
00:02:25,192 --> 00:02:26,650
Raugh!

46
00:02:26,733 --> 00:02:28,358
[FALK grunts]

47
00:02:28,442 --> 00:02:30,483
[WHITTY]
Man down!

48
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:32,442
Call a doctor! Hurry it up!

49
00:02:35,317 --> 00:02:36,608
[chuckles]

50
00:04:12,567 --> 00:04:14,942
[NARRATOR] Reserve Commodore
Falk's assassination attempt

51
00:04:15,025 --> 00:04:17,733
against Operations
Center Chief Cubersly was

52
00:04:17,817 --> 00:04:21,608
an unprecedented incident
of internal violence

53
00:04:21,692 --> 00:04:23,692
towards a key military figure.

54
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,067
[NARRATOR] In the aftermath
of the failed invasion

55
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:30,567
of the Empire, the people's
despair deepened,

56
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:32,942
and the disorder
fueled national tensions

57
00:04:33,025 --> 00:04:35,192
to an unbearable extreme.

58
00:04:37,692 --> 00:04:39,317
They want me
to act as interim chief

59
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,942
while also serving
my current position?

60
00:04:42,025 --> 00:04:43,483
[PFEIFER]
Yes, sir.

61
00:04:43,567 --> 00:04:46,442
It was a confidential request
from the Defense Committee.

62
00:04:46,525 --> 00:04:48,442
Then you can
tell them I decline.

63
00:04:48,525 --> 00:04:50,942
That's a recklessly
problematic solution.

64
00:04:51,025 --> 00:04:53,567
Delegating both Operations
Center and Commander-in-Chief

65
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:56,067
duties to one person is foolish.

66
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:58,775
We should be avoiding
risks, not taking them.

67
00:05:00,858 --> 00:05:02,942
[NARRATOR] Given the
commotion, many had thought

68
00:05:03,025 --> 00:05:06,650
that selecting a provisional
successor would be difficult.

69
00:05:06,733 --> 00:05:09,483
But one man volunteered
himself for the role.

70
00:05:09,567 --> 00:05:12,275
An officer of meager
popularity at best,

71
00:05:12,358 --> 00:05:14,192
Admiral Dawson.

72
00:05:14,275 --> 00:05:15,692
[BEWCOCK]
On second thought,

73
00:05:15,775 --> 00:05:19,233
maybe I should've
said yes after all. [sighs]

74
00:05:19,317 --> 00:05:21,608
[NARRATOR]
Unfortunately, tragedy struck

75
00:05:21,692 --> 00:05:23,358
the very next day.

76
00:05:24,692 --> 00:05:27,067
[NARRATOR] An accidental
explosion resulted in fire

77
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:30,817
at the maintenance center
of the Air Defense Base.

78
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,942
There were 14 casualties.

79
00:05:33,025 --> 00:05:35,275
All of them young soldiers
who had yet to reach

80
00:05:35,358 --> 00:05:36,900
the age of 20.

81
00:05:36,983 --> 00:05:40,358
Naturally, this horrified
Alliance citizens.

82
00:05:42,067 --> 00:05:44,150
[JESSICA] This brutal war
with the Galactic Empire

83
00:05:44,233 --> 00:05:47,150
has dragged on for
over 150 years.

84
00:05:47,233 --> 00:05:48,525
And all for what?

85
00:05:48,608 --> 00:05:50,900
Sacrificing countless
children to fuel

86
00:05:50,983 --> 00:05:52,317
an endless conflict?

87
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,317
Do we want to live in a
society that would accept this

88
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,692
as normal?

89
00:05:55,775 --> 00:05:57,317
Now's the time
to question everything

90
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,067
we've been told was true.

91
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,650
That there was no other way
to stop this bloodshed.

92
00:06:01,733 --> 00:06:03,608
There's only one solution.

93
00:06:03,692 --> 00:06:05,067
And it is peace!

94
00:06:06,775 --> 00:06:09,192
She definitely doesn't
hold anything back.

95
00:06:09,275 --> 00:06:13,150
[BEWCOCK] She shouldn't.
Because she's absolutely right.

96
00:06:13,233 --> 00:06:15,275
There's something
very wrong with a civilization

97
00:06:15,358 --> 00:06:17,983
that would let an old soldier
such as myself live on

98
00:06:18,067 --> 00:06:19,983
while the young ones die.

99
00:06:20,067 --> 00:06:21,942
If no one calls
attention to that,

100
00:06:22,025 --> 00:06:24,942
then things will only
continue to get worse.

101
00:06:25,025 --> 00:06:27,775
We need to protect
hearts and minds like hers.

102
00:06:27,858 --> 00:06:31,358
Without them, the Alliance
would surely lose its humanity.

103
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:42,358
[DAWSON]
As I'm sure you've been aware.

104
00:06:42,442 --> 00:06:44,442
For the last two weeks
we've been seeing a series

105
00:06:44,525 --> 00:06:47,400
of violent revolutions breaking
out on the planets Neptis,

106
00:06:47,483 --> 00:06:49,817
Kaffa, Purmurend, and Shampool.

107
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,733
--[YANG] Right.
--Your orders are to lead

108
00:06:51,817 --> 00:06:53,150
the Iserlohn Garrison Fleet

109
00:06:53,233 --> 00:06:55,067
and put an end to
any resistance efforts

110
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:58,233
as quickly as possible
to restore balance.

111
00:06:58,317 --> 00:07:01,025
This is all happening
on four different planets.

112
00:07:01,108 --> 00:07:03,317
We'd be leaving the fortress
vulnerable for quite

113
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,108
a hefty length of time.

114
00:07:05,192 --> 00:07:07,317
The Empire is
currently preoccupied with

115
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,775
a vast civil war.

116
00:07:08,858 --> 00:07:11,233
There's very little chance of
them invading Iserlohn

117
00:07:11,317 --> 00:07:13,775
with anything approaching
considerable numbers.

118
00:07:13,858 --> 00:07:15,400
I'm certain
you'll be able to fulfill

119
00:07:15,483 --> 00:07:17,942
your soldierly duty
without reservations,

120
00:07:18,025 --> 00:07:19,275
Commander Yang.

121
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:23,733
[JULIAN]
What's this Dawson's deal?

122
00:07:23,817 --> 00:07:25,400
How old is he?

123
00:07:25,483 --> 00:07:27,942
[YANG]
I'd say he's in his mid 40s.

124
00:07:28,025 --> 00:07:30,525
I suppose his most immediate
goal as my superior

125
00:07:30,608 --> 00:07:33,858
is to work us as hard
as he possibly can.

126
00:07:33,942 --> 00:07:36,567
Though I haven't
the faintest clue as to why.

127
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:39,275
He has a reputation for holding
personal grudges but I've never

128
00:07:39,358 --> 00:07:42,692
met the man, so I don't see
any reason for him to resent me.

129
00:07:42,775 --> 00:07:43,900
If I'm not mistaken,

130
00:07:43,983 --> 00:07:46,400
you'll be turning 30
this year, right, sir?

131
00:07:46,483 --> 00:07:49,233
Yeah. I guess
I've hit that age, huh?

132
00:07:49,317 --> 00:07:50,358
[JULIAN]
Well, that's why.

133
00:07:50,442 --> 00:07:51,858
[YANG]
Hmm?

134
00:07:51,942 --> 00:07:53,817
[JULIAN] You're so much
younger than he is.

135
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,775
But you're already
the same rank.

136
00:07:55,858 --> 00:07:58,483
It's not like you're someone
old like Admiral Bewcock.

137
00:07:58,567 --> 00:08:00,983
Of course he's jealous.

138
00:08:01,067 --> 00:08:03,608
No kidding. That's funny.

139
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:05,983
I didn't even think of that.

140
00:08:06,067 --> 00:08:07,817
Perhaps the admiral
wasn't able to predict

141
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:10,483
the assassination attempt,
but he did catch on

142
00:08:10,567 --> 00:08:12,900
to what Lohengramm was planning.

143
00:08:12,983 --> 00:08:14,817
The Marquis intends
to meddle with the Alliance

144
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:19,692
as much as he can
while keeping his hands clean.

145
00:08:19,775 --> 00:08:21,025
He's intense.

146
00:08:21,108 --> 00:08:23,442
I wonder what's next.

147
00:08:23,525 --> 00:08:25,483
A takeover in the capital.

148
00:08:26,692 --> 00:08:29,192
[YANG] But what's after
that is beyond me.

149
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:33,567
I doubt Marquis Lohengramm
actually knows, either.

150
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:36,150
Who's the mastermind
behind the coup?

151
00:08:36,233 --> 00:08:37,817
That's the big question.

152
00:08:38,858 --> 00:08:40,692
Do you have any ideas?

153
00:08:40,775 --> 00:08:44,567
No clue. We'll
find out soon enough.

154
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:46,400
He's asking us
to stop rebellions

155
00:08:46,483 --> 00:08:49,608
on four different planets, then?
All by ourselves?

156
00:08:49,692 --> 00:08:51,900
[WALTER] So we're the ones
who have to sweat

157
00:08:51,983 --> 00:08:55,400
while they get to keep their
forces sitting at home.

158
00:08:55,483 --> 00:08:57,067
That's awfully petty.

159
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:59,150
[MURAI] Whatever the case may

A state of emergency has been
declared on planet Heinessen.

As of this current day
of April 13th, UC 797.

For the sake of this nation,

we establish the National
Salvation Military Council

as the new government.

171
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:32,233
Heinessen is
now under martial law,

172
00:09:32,317 --> 00:09:34,775
and our forces shall hereby
assume complete control

All in the name
of salvation, huh?

00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:40,483
[BRONZE] The constitution
is dead and in its place

176
00:09:40,567 --> 00:09:42,400
we implement the
following new decrees.

177
00:09:42,483 --> 00:09:44,483
Your full attention, please.

178
00:09:44,567 --> 00:09:47,275
Number one: A unified
national regime

179
00:09:47,358 --> 00:09:49,650
will be forged with the
noble goal of vanquishing

181
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:54,400
Second: Political
activity and speech

182
00:09:54,483 --> 00:09:58,067
contradicting the national
interest will be regulated.

are granted

both judicial and police powers.

185
00:10:03,108 --> 00:10:06,192
Fourth: Non-essential
social services will be cut

186
00:10:06,275 --> 00:10:09,025
as to prevent the
weakening of society.

187

190

It's no different from what
Rudolf von Goldenbaum said

00:10:17,108 --> 00:10:19,442
just over 500 years ago.

There is no need to be
frightened by our actions.

199
00:10:54,942 --> 00:10:57,400
Our goal is
to create a new world.

One in which all people may
enjoy a righteous reputation.

And live righteously
until our final days.

202
00:11:04,233 --> 00:11:06,067
As it should be.

203
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:07,858
If you examine history,

204
00:11:07,942 --> 00:11:10,525
you will see that when
government becomes fraudulent

205
00:11:10,608 --> 00:11:13,067
and society loses its way,

206
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:16,067
there will always be those
who rise above the system

207
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:18,233
to rectify order.

208

We are the ones
who will inspire.

Revolution is here.
From this moment on,

the history of the Free Planets
Alliance shall change.

211
00:11:29,067 --> 00:11:31,983
I must be going
senile in my old age.

00:11:32,067 --> 00:11:33,483
Please forgive us, sir.

213

This is for the greater good.

I see you've all
been contaminated.

Not only the Departments of
Intelligence and Inspection,

216
00:11:42,817 --> 00:11:45,650
but even the men who've been
serving directly under me.

217
00:11:47,358 --> 00:11:49,192
[BEWCOCK]
Well, look who it is.

218
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:53,192
I recognize that stench.
You're Rear Admiral Lynch.

219
00:11:53,275 --> 00:11:55,192
I'm so honored
that you remember me--

220
00:11:55,275 --> 00:11:56,942
you're making me blush.

221
00:11:59,775 --> 00:12:02,442
There was a time
I thought highly of you.

222
00:12:02,525 --> 00:12:04,775
You were one of the most
sensible, reasonable men

223
00:12:04,858 --> 00:12:06,067
in the service.

224
00:12:07,483 --> 00:12:10,483
Sadly, it appears I
overestimated your character.

225
00:12:10,567 --> 00:12:11,983
I never thought that
you would take part

226
00:12:12,067 --> 00:12:13,817
in such an ugly affair.

227
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:18,400
I can only imagine that your
morality has fallen fast asleep.

228
00:12:18,483 --> 00:12:19,650
Quite the opposite.

229
00:12:19,733 --> 00:12:21,900
It feels like
I finally woke up.

230
00:12:21,983 --> 00:12:24,275
Our government has become
crooked beyond function,

231
00:12:24,358 --> 00:12:27,358
and the progression of
society has grown stagnant.

232
00:12:27,442 --> 00:12:30,775
Mob rule is running rampant
in the guise of democracy.

233
00:12:30,858 --> 00:12:33,442
And it shows no sign
of self-control.

234
00:12:33,525 --> 00:12:36,233
How else are we supposed
to correct this behavior?

235
00:12:36,317 --> 00:12:38,650
This is the path of reform.

236
00:12:41,983 --> 00:12:43,442
So that's it.

237
00:12:43,525 --> 00:12:45,567
I can agree with you that the
present system is certainly

238
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:47,400
stifled and corrupt.

239
00:12:47,483 --> 00:12:49,858
However, I fail to
understand your solution

240
00:12:49,942 --> 00:12:52,858
to overthrow
everything by force.

241
00:12:52,942 --> 00:12:55,775
So, if I may venture to ask,

242
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:58,650
once you and your
military inevitably rot,

243
00:12:58,733 --> 00:13:01,442
who corrects you? And how?

244
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,858
We had no other choice
but to take a stand.

245
00:13:05,942 --> 00:13:08,942
And unlike those who
merely cry out for peace,

246

How very naïve.

00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:40,192
Ever since the first humans
walked upon the earth,

259
00:13:40,275 --> 00:13:42,733
governing the people with
acts of terrorism has never

260
00:13:42,817 --> 00:13:46,317
been "civilized" and
certainly not "courteous."

261
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,067
If you want
people to call it that,

262
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:50,358
why not employ this
power you've gained?

00:13:50,442 --> 00:13:52,692
You should try using it
to write a new dictionary

we can spend all day

00:14:00,233 --> 00:14:01,942
speaking to each other,
but it's unlikely

268
00:14:02,025 --> 00:14:03,983
we'll find any common ground.

00:14:04,067 --> 00:14:08,192
The only choice left is to let
history itself be our judge.

270
00:14:13,067 --> 00:14:14,817
Now take him to another room.

00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:17,150
And remember to be respectful.

History may have nothing
to say about you, Admiral.

00:16:56,733 --> 00:16:58,442
Am I wrong?

320
00:16:58,525 --> 00:17:00,525
[YANG sighs]
I appreciate the sentiment,

321
00:17:00,608 --> 00:17:02,692
but what about Reinhard
von Lohengramm?

322
00:17:02,775 --> 00:17:05,608
Watching you face off
would be fascinating.

323
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:08,275
Personally speaking, if you
both mobilized your forces

324
00:17:08,358 --> 00:17:09,942
under equal conditions,

325
00:17:10,025 --> 00:17:13,067
I'm confident that you
would defeat him.

326
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:16,358
That doesn't amount
to more than wishful thinking.

327
00:17:16,442 --> 00:17:20,608
[WALTER] Hmph. At any rate,
let's move on to the next topic.

328
00:17:23,608 --> 00:17:25,900
You possess a profoundly
intimate knowledge

329
00:17:25,983 --> 00:17:28,942
of the Free Planets Alliance's
current power structure,

330
00:17:29,025 --> 00:17:33,192
and understand too well
how corrupt it happens to be.

331
00:17:33,275 --> 00:17:34,567
Yet you persevere,

332
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:38,358
devoting all of your efforts
into trying to save it.

333
00:17:38,442 --> 00:17:41,233
Why, that's another
glaring contradiction.

334
00:17:41,317 --> 00:17:42,400
The truth is,

335
00:17:42,483 --> 00:17:45,358
"best" doesn't exist,
but "better" does.

336
00:17:45,442 --> 00:17:47,067
I recognize that
the Alliance hasn't

337
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:48,650
always played nice.

338
00:17:48,733 --> 00:17:52,233
But the National Salvation
Military Council...

339
00:17:52,317 --> 00:17:54,150
You heard their credo.

340
00:17:54,233 --> 00:17:56,400
Without a doubt,
they are infinitely worse

341
00:17:56,483 --> 00:17:58,025
than the present regime.

342
00:18:01,525 --> 00:18:04,858
[YANG grunting]

343
00:18:04,942 --> 00:18:07,150
If I might be so brazen,

344
00:18:07,233 --> 00:18:09,900
I believe we should let those
buffoons in the military council

345
00:18:09,983 --> 00:18:12,608
purge away the
prevailing officials.

346
00:18:12,692 --> 00:18:16,108
Thoroughly. And permanently.

347
00:18:16,192 --> 00:18:20,358
In due time, they'll expose
their incompetence as leaders.

348
00:18:20,442 --> 00:18:22,858
That's when you
make your entrance.

349
00:18:22,942 --> 00:18:25,067
You'll chase out
the last hypocrites.

350
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:28,567
And seize control as
the man who restored democracy.

351
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:31,900
Now that would be "better."

352
00:18:31,983 --> 00:18:33,108
How about it?

353
00:18:33,192 --> 00:18:34,942
You can have whatever
title you want.

354
00:18:35,025 --> 00:18:37,608
Become a leader with the
power to protect the people,

355
00:18:37,692 --> 00:18:41,108
however you see fit!

356
00:18:41,192 --> 00:18:43,442
[YANG]
Yang Wen-li the Dictator, huh?

357
00:18:46,483 --> 00:18:49,692
Sorry, but I don't really
think that's my style

358
00:18:49,775 --> 00:18:50,900
[WALTER sighs]

359
00:18:56,775 --> 00:18:58,067
[WALTER]
You know,

360
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:01,150
playing soldier doesn't seem
to suit you much either.

361
00:19:01,233 --> 00:19:02,192
And despite that,

362
00:19:02,275 --> 00:19:04,150
you're doing
remarkably well at it.

363
00:19:04,233 --> 00:19:05,942
If you put your mind to it,
I wager you'd make

364
00:19:06,025 --> 00:19:08,942
a pretty good dictator.

365
00:19:09,025 --> 00:19:11,025
[YANG]
Commodore Schönkopf?

366
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:12,650
[WALTER]
Yes?

367
00:19:12,733 --> 00:19:14,733
Regarding these thoughts
you've mentioned,

368
00:19:14,817 --> 00:19:17,650
have you shared your ideas
with anyone besides me?

369
00:19:17,733 --> 00:19:20,358
Ah. I would never.

370
00:19:20,442 --> 00:19:21,817
Very well, then.

371
00:19:30,608 --> 00:19:32,942
[GREENHILL] Yang Wen-li has
formally refused to participate

372
00:19:33,025 --> 00:19:34,525
in the Council's efforts.

373
00:19:36,442 --> 00:19:38,233
Admiral Legrange.

374
00:19:38,317 --> 00:19:39,775
Sir.

375
00:19:39,858 --> 00:19:41,192
[GREENHILL] You will lead the
Eleventh Fleet in the battle

376
00:19:41,275 --> 00:19:44,650
against Yang's forces.
Do not hold back.

377
00:19:44,733 --> 00:19:46,483
Mission accepted.

378
00:19:46,567 --> 00:19:49,067
Wait. But then, what
about your daughter?

379
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:51,817
Unfortunate as it may be,
for our plan to succeed,

380
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,525
I had to gave up on her.

381
00:19:53,608 --> 00:19:54,942
I understand, sir.

382
00:19:55,025 --> 00:19:57,317
You have my word that
I'll make them submit to us.

383
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:00,400
Or annihilate them
completely, if necessary.

384
00:20:06,067 --> 00:20:07,442
What a surprise.

385
00:20:07,525 --> 00:20:09,275
I never realized
your true calling was

386
00:20:09,358 --> 00:20:11,233
as a grand spokesperson.

387
00:20:11,317 --> 00:20:13,233
Maybe. But I
really wasn't bluffing

388
00:20:13,317 --> 00:20:14,650
when said those things.

389
00:20:14,733 --> 00:20:15,900
It was the truth.

390
00:20:20,483 --> 00:20:21,983
[CLERK 17A]
You there.

391
00:20:22,067 --> 00:20:25,192
You live with Admiral
Yang. Is that right?

392
00:20:25,275 --> 00:20:26,192
[JULIAN]
Yes?

393
00:20:26,275 --> 00:20:27,608
[CLERK 17A]
What's your take?

394
00:20:27,692 --> 00:20:30,275
Do you think he has any
chance of winning this thing?

395
00:20:30,358 --> 00:20:33,275
[ONLOOKERS murmuring]

396
00:20:36,317 --> 00:20:38,525
You should know Admiral
Yang Wen-li doesn't fight

397
00:20:38,608 --> 00:20:40,525
any battles he can't win.

398
00:20:40,608 --> 00:20:41,775
--[ONLOOKERS gasping]
--What the...

399
00:20:41,858 --> 00:20:45,525
--Hear that? He's right!
--Yep. That's Yang! Heh!

400
00:20:45,608 --> 00:20:46,733
We'll be fine!

401
00:20:46,817 --> 00:20:49,275
You're Miracle Yang, after all

402
00:20:55,567 --> 00:20:56,983
[YANG]
Talk to me about the boy.

403
00:20:57,067 --> 00:20:58,817
Is he ready to ship out?

404
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:01,817
How's his marksmanship
and hand-to-hand combat?

405
00:21:02,567 --> 00:21:04,858
Speaking honestly
as his instructor,

406
00:21:04,942 --> 00:21:08,150
he's more than sufficiently
prepared to stand as a soldier.

407
00:21:08,233 --> 00:21:11,608
I imagine he will be of greater
use than you in that regard.

408
00:21:11,692 --> 00:21:13,150
Heh!

409
00:21:13,233 --> 00:21:16,608
Although... you ultimately want
more for Julian, don't you?

410
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:20,567
Something far beyond
the confines of all this.

411
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:23,942
There's limits to
our abilities as humans.

412
00:21:24,025 --> 00:21:25,483
Despite that,

413
00:21:25,567 --> 00:21:29,358
we have the means to set destiny
in motion with our choices.

414
00:21:29,442 --> 00:21:33,358
My hope is that he accomplishes
that in as many ways as he can.

415
00:21:33,442 --> 00:21:35,067
And even if he doesn't,

416
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:38,983
I still want him to have the
potential and skillset to do so.

417
00:21:39,067 --> 00:21:40,692
Well? How 'bout yourself?

418
00:21:40,775 --> 00:21:42,817
I'm afraid it's too late for me.

419
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:45,483
I've got myself chin-deep
to the point of no return

420
00:21:45,567 --> 00:21:47,275
with the Alliance.

421
00:21:47,358 --> 00:21:49,067
Nothing but obligations
to meet for the people

422
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:51,692
who pay my salary.

423
00:21:51,775 --> 00:21:53,192
I understand.

424
00:21:53,275 --> 00:21:55,275
Y'know, I'm beginning to see the
reason why you won't allow

425
00:21:55,358 --> 00:21:58,192
Julian to become
official military.

426
00:21:58,275 --> 00:22:00,608
You'd like to save him from
any compulsory obedience

427
00:22:00,692 --> 00:22:03,817
to the Free Planets Alliance.

428
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:07,192
I'm not sure I'd given
it all that much thought.

429

[FREDERICA]
Admiral.

What destination
would you like us

433
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,317
to set a course for, sir?

434
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,817
Okay, let's take a look.

the future of the Free Planets
