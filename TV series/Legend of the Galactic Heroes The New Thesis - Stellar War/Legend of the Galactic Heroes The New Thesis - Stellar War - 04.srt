1
00:00:28,483 --> 00:00:30,817
[HANS] We've been awaiting
your arrival, Milady.

2
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:32,317
There you are!

3
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,150
It's quite a relief to see
that you've made back safely.

4
00:00:35,233 --> 00:00:38,567
Though. What led you to
return home in such haste?

5
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:41,192
Is everything all right, Madam?

6
00:00:41,275 --> 00:00:43,900
Do tell me, Hans,
how has my father been doing?

7
00:02:24,275 --> 00:02:26,733
[HILDA]
Hello, Father.

8
00:02:26,817 --> 00:02:28,650
[FRANZ]
Oh, Hilda, it's you.

9
00:02:28,733 --> 00:02:30,650
I thought I'd come to visit.

10
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:31,817
How nice.

11
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,858
Well then.
How are classes going?

12
00:02:33,942 --> 00:02:35,483
Good as usual.

13
00:02:35,567 --> 00:02:36,983
But I'm more interested
in learning about

14
00:02:37,067 --> 00:02:39,150
what's keeping
you in deep thought.

15
00:02:39,233 --> 00:02:41,983
Oh, nothing of
great importance, my dear.

16
00:02:42,067 --> 00:02:44,442
[HILDA]
My, that's certainly reassuring.

17
00:02:45,775 --> 00:02:47,817
So, the future
of the Mariendorf family

18
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,150
and the fate of the
Galactic Empire.

19
00:02:50,233 --> 00:02:53,192
You say they're "nothing
of great importance?"

20
00:02:55,192 --> 00:02:56,525
Whether you want to or not,

21
00:02:56,608 --> 00:02:59,025
that's all you can hear about
when you live on Odin.

22
00:02:59,108 --> 00:03:01,067
You're not the only
nobleman in a quandary

23
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:03,775
over who you'll
pledge allegiance to.

24
00:03:03,858 --> 00:03:05,983
[FRANZ]
I see.

25
00:03:06,067 --> 00:03:07,400
That being said,

26
00:03:07,483 --> 00:03:09,692
have you arrived
at a decision yet?

27
00:03:13,858 --> 00:03:16,233
[FRANZ] I would much
prefer to remain neutral.

28
00:03:16,317 --> 00:03:20,733
But, if I absolutely must
choose a faction to advocate,

29
00:03:20,817 --> 00:03:22,358
then yes.

30
00:03:22,442 --> 00:03:24,775
We shall defer to
supporting Duke Braunschweig.

31
00:03:24,858 --> 00:03:26,358
As imperial nobility,
the best option--

32
00:03:26,442 --> 00:03:28,233
[HILDA]
Oh, Father.

33
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:35,275
[HILDA] There's a truth that
nearly all of the aristocracy

34
00:03:35,358 --> 00:03:37,608
refuses to acknowledge.

35
00:03:37,692 --> 00:03:40,692
Just as all people born
will eventually die,

36
00:03:40,775 --> 00:03:44,150
all nations face
inevitable death as well.

37
00:03:44,233 --> 00:03:47,317
Since the dawn of
human civilization on Earth.

38
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,067
Without a single outlier.

39
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:52,025
Ultimate destruction
always awaits us.

40
00:03:52,108 --> 00:03:53,608
[HILDA]
So then, why?

41
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:56,400
Why should the Goldenbaum
Dynasty be the only exception

42
00:03:56,483 --> 00:03:58,567
over any other age?

43
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:00,817
Hilda. Watch your tongue!

44
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,025
The Goldenbaum Dynasty
has already survived

45
00:04:03,108 --> 00:04:05,233
for nearly 500 years now.

46
00:04:05,317 --> 00:04:07,233
What's more, they did
this while oppressing

47
00:04:07,317 --> 00:04:09,733
the population through
a depraved monopoly.

48
00:04:09,817 --> 00:04:13,233
All of it was born out of a
desire for wealth and power.

49
00:04:13,317 --> 00:04:14,608
Many people were killed.

50
00:04:14,692 --> 00:04:16,692
Countless young daughters
were stolen away.

51
00:04:16,775 --> 00:04:22,108
A multitude of manipulative laws
all made for exclusive benefit.

52
00:04:22,192 --> 00:04:25,025
Tell me. Would it
really be all that surprising

53
00:04:25,108 --> 00:04:29,067
if a nation like that were
on the verge of collapse?

54
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:31,150
Yes. Perhaps that may be.

55
00:04:31,233 --> 00:04:33,358
But there's still no reason
for us to throw in

56
00:04:33,442 --> 00:04:34,733
with Marquis Lohengramm.

57
00:04:34,817 --> 00:04:36,400
[HILDA]
Oh, there is.

58
00:04:40,942 --> 00:04:42,108
Very well.

59
00:04:42,192 --> 00:04:45,233
My dear, I shall leave
it all in your hands.

60
00:04:46,067 --> 00:04:47,442
[HILDA chuckles]

61
00:04:49,692 --> 00:04:53,233
Thank you so much, Father,
for everything you've done.

62
00:04:53,317 --> 00:04:55,400
You've given me
such a charmed life.

63
00:04:55,483 --> 00:04:58,358
Right at the verge of
this most exciting era.

64
00:05:12,692 --> 00:05:14,400
[RÜCKE]
My apologies for the wait!

65
00:05:16,108 --> 00:05:17,733
His Excellency will see you now.

66
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,317
Right this way, madam.

67
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:23,942
[REINHARD] If only Kircheis
were here. What a shame.

68
00:05:24,025 --> 00:05:27,025
He has a bit of history with
the Mariendorf household.

69
00:05:27,108 --> 00:05:28,192
Are you familiar?

70
00:05:28,275 --> 00:05:29,817
Yes, Of course.

71
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:32,275
We've never met but he
saved my father's life last year

72
00:05:32,358 --> 00:05:34,525
during the Castrop rebellion.

73
00:05:34,608 --> 00:05:38,275
So, what business
did you come to discuss?

74
00:05:38,358 --> 00:05:40,525
I'm here as
a gesture of support, sir.

75
00:05:40,608 --> 00:05:42,775
We, of the Mariendorf family,
would like to pledge

76
00:05:42,858 --> 00:05:45,692
our solidarity to you
in the coming civil war.

77
00:05:45,775 --> 00:05:47,025
What civil war?

78
00:05:47,108 --> 00:05:48,817
[HILDA] The one brewing
against Duke Braunschwieg,

79
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,858
which could start at any moment.

80
00:05:50,942 --> 00:05:52,775
[REINHARD] Hmph.
You're a bold one, aren't you?

81
00:05:52,858 --> 00:05:54,608
Suppose what you say were true.

82
00:05:54,692 --> 00:05:57,692
My victory would
hardly be guaranteed.

83
00:05:57,775 --> 00:05:59,983
You still wish to
assert an alliance?

84
00:06:00,067 --> 00:06:02,733
Yes. Because
I believe you'd win.

85
00:06:02,817 --> 00:06:06,025
[REINHARD] Oh? And what
inspires this confidence?

86
00:06:06,108 --> 00:06:08,400
[HILDA]
If you'll indulge me, sir.

87
00:06:09,858 --> 00:06:11,358
First of all,
you have the blessing

88
00:06:11,442 --> 00:06:14,150
of both the new Kaiser
and Marquis Lichtenlade.

89
00:06:14,233 --> 00:06:16,400
Therefore, you possess
the just cause of subjugating

90
00:06:16,483 --> 00:06:19,692
any opposition who
dare defy their authority.

91
00:06:19,775 --> 00:06:21,025
On the other hand,

92
00:06:21,108 --> 00:06:23,483
Duke Braunschweig
and Marquis Littenheim?

93
00:06:23,567 --> 00:06:25,817
The two of them are waging
a selfish war as a means

94
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:28,942
of achieving nothing
but wealth and glory.

95
00:06:29,025 --> 00:06:30,692
To that end,

96
00:06:30,775 --> 00:06:33,858
they may have decided
to join forces temporarily.

97
00:06:33,942 --> 00:06:36,650
But they have no the
desire to help each other.

98
00:06:36,733 --> 00:06:39,067
Unlike the forces
of Marquis Lohengramm,

99
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:43,233
they lack both a solid chain
of command and a unified will.

100
00:06:43,317 --> 00:06:45,817
Lastly, he may
not have been born

101
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,858
into a noble family
of high standing,

102
00:06:47,942 --> 00:06:49,942
but neither were the rank
and file, ordinary soldiers

103
00:06:50,025 --> 00:06:51,442
who fight for him.

104
00:06:51,525 --> 00:06:53,983
This makes the Marquis quite
popular among the commoners.

105
00:06:54,067 --> 00:06:55,608
The grassroots
support from the oppressed

106
00:06:55,692 --> 00:06:57,858
will surely bring him victory.

107
00:06:58,858 --> 00:07:00,733
I trust in you, Your Excellency.

108
00:07:00,817 --> 00:07:03,067
To do away with
antiquated values.

109
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:04,692
And to build
a magnificent future

110
00:07:04,775 --> 00:07:06,275
through this inevitable war.

111
00:07:08,108 --> 00:07:09,650
How interesting.

112
00:07:09,733 --> 00:07:12,067
I could use an insightful
and well-spoken ally

113
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:13,483
such as yourself.

114
00:07:13,567 --> 00:07:15,275
I'll be certain to ensure
that the arrangement

115
00:07:15,358 --> 00:07:17,608
is mutually beneficial.

116
00:07:17,692 --> 00:07:20,733
Your family will be held
in favorable regard, of course.

117
00:07:20,817 --> 00:07:24,525
And I shall extend that to any
other families you suggest.

118
00:07:24,608 --> 00:07:26,942
I'm touched
by your generosity, sir.

119
00:07:27,025 --> 00:07:29,067
Your words will doubtlessly
assuage my loved ones

120
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:30,817
to feel the same.

121
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,275
Please.

122
00:07:32,358 --> 00:07:34,442
You went through the trouble
of coming to meet with me.

123
00:07:34,525 --> 00:07:37,275
This is the least I can do to
compensate for your courage

124
00:07:37,358 --> 00:07:39,233
and your thoughtfulness.

125
00:07:39,317 --> 00:07:41,150
If there's anything
I can assist you with,

126
00:07:41,233 --> 00:07:44,983
don't hesitate to ask me.
Whatever the request may be.

127
00:07:45,067 --> 00:07:47,317
Well, as long
as you'll permit me,

128
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,942
then there is a favor
I'd like to invoke.

129
00:07:50,025 --> 00:07:51,483
[REINHARD]
Go ahead.

130
00:07:51,567 --> 00:07:54,525
[HILDA] If possible, I'd like to
request an official document

131
00:07:54,608 --> 00:07:57,858
recognizing our fealty,
a token of our loyalty.

132
00:07:57,942 --> 00:07:59,817
Something securing both
the house of Mariendorf's

133
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:02,233
social standings
and land rights.

134
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:06,692
Oh? Documentation?

135
00:08:06,775 --> 00:08:08,275
Yes.

136
00:08:10,233 --> 00:08:11,650
Very well.

137
00:08:11,733 --> 00:08:13,983
I'll have that in writing for
you by the end of the day.

138
00:08:15,233 --> 00:08:17,150
I'm incredibly grateful.

139
00:08:17,233 --> 00:08:18,608
From this day forward,

140
00:08:18,692 --> 00:08:21,733
I swear absolute devotion
on behalf of my family.

141
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:27,108
If I may, Fräulein Mariendorf.

142
00:08:27,192 --> 00:08:29,358
Regarding the other
households you intend

143
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:30,817
to recruit on our behalf.

144
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,358
Will they require
similar documentation?

145
00:08:33,442 --> 00:08:35,525
I would appreciate if
Your Excellency provided it

146
00:08:35,608 --> 00:08:37,233
for those who so desire.

147
00:08:37,317 --> 00:08:39,442
I'd wage those nobles
who don't request them have

148
00:08:39,525 --> 00:08:41,442
no real need for such papers.

149
00:08:41,525 --> 00:08:43,942
[REINHARD chuckles]
Yes, that's only fair.

150
00:08:44,025 --> 00:08:45,400
I believe you
possess the ability

151
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:47,442
to recognize those worthy.

152
00:08:47,525 --> 00:08:50,108
The people with the strength
to live in this coming age.

153
00:08:51,275 --> 00:08:54,025
Oh? Then that's what I shall do.

154
00:08:54,108 --> 00:08:57,733
I must say, Fräulein, you're
quite the clever young woman.

155
00:08:57,817 --> 00:09:00,858
I never knew there were
people of nobility like you.

156
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:03,900
--[HILDA chuckles]
--[knocking]

157
00:09:03,983 --> 00:09:05,650
[REINHARD]
You may enter.

158
00:09:05,733 --> 00:09:06,692
Pardon me.

159
00:09:06,775 --> 00:09:08,400
We have finally
received the report.

160
00:09:08,483 --> 00:09:09,775
It's here.

161
00:09:09,858 --> 00:09:11,608
This has been
a pleasure, Fräulein.

162
00:09:11,692 --> 00:09:15,233
Please excuse me.
I hope we meet again.

163
00:09:15,317 --> 00:09:16,817
Yes.

164
00:09:26,192 --> 00:09:27,442
[sighs]

165
00:09:33,275 --> 00:09:35,317
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile,
a gathering was held

166
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,025
on a private villa.

167
00:09:37,108 --> 00:09:39,858
The noblemen against the
Lohengramm-Lichtenlade axis

168
00:09:39,942 --> 00:09:41,692
formed an alliance.

169
00:09:41,775 --> 00:09:44,692
It would become known
as the Lippstadt Pact.

170
00:09:44,775 --> 00:09:48,525
It's leader:
Duke Otto von Braunschweig.

171
00:09:48,608 --> 00:09:52,400
His second:
Marquis Wilhelm von Littenheim.

172
00:09:52,483 --> 00:09:57,942
The number of participating
nobles totaled roughly 3,740.

173
00:09:58,025 --> 00:10:01,525
And their soldiers
outnumbered Reinhard's forces.

174
00:10:03,483 --> 00:10:06,942
[NARRATOR] They decided on a
name for their new organization.

175
00:10:07,025 --> 00:10:09,692
The Lippstadt Nobles Coalition.

176
00:10:17,108 --> 00:10:18,692
[BRAUNSCHWEIG]
Why the long face?

177
00:10:18,775 --> 00:10:19,900
[OVLESSER]
Hm.

178
00:10:19,983 --> 00:10:21,692
It doesn't suit you.

179
00:10:37,692 --> 00:10:39,275
[horse whinnies]

180
00:10:41,025 --> 00:10:43,692
[MÜCKENBERGER]
No need to salute me. Heh.

181
00:10:43,775 --> 00:10:45,900
Not when I've left my position.

182
00:10:45,983 --> 00:10:47,233
All right.

183
00:10:47,317 --> 00:10:49,108
I've come to inform you
of a gathering being held

184
00:10:49,192 --> 00:10:50,775
at Duke Braunschweig's villa.

185
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:53,317
Officially, it's billed
as a garden party.

186
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,483
Though I'm sure you can
imagine the true purpose.

187
00:10:56,567 --> 00:10:58,525
Whatever it may be, I decline.

188
00:10:58,608 --> 00:10:59,942
But Your Excellency!

189
00:11:01,692 --> 00:11:04,775
I said to drop the formalities.

190
00:11:04,858 --> 00:11:07,900
Are you still unable to
comprehend the boy's talent?

191
00:11:07,983 --> 00:11:10,400
After everything,
why do you still take his side?

192
00:11:10,483 --> 00:11:11,400
To put it simply,

193
00:11:11,483 --> 00:11:13,400
it's because I can
see the truth.

194
00:11:13,483 --> 00:11:14,483
[OVLESSER]
But, sir!

195
00:11:14,567 --> 00:11:16,775
As a free civilian
in retirement.

196
00:11:16,858 --> 00:11:20,275
Allow me to give you a piece
of important advice.

197
00:11:20,358 --> 00:11:23,650
That boy intends to
defeat anyone who doubts him.

198
00:11:23,733 --> 00:11:26,775
He will eradicate all who
are stuck in the past.

199
00:11:26,858 --> 00:11:28,317
[OVLESSER growls]

200
00:11:31,692 --> 00:11:34,525
[FLEGEL] How dare he
make a mockery of us.

201
00:11:34,608 --> 00:11:36,275
The nerve of that man!

202
00:11:36,358 --> 00:11:39,400
Muckenberger
is getting on in years.

203
00:11:39,483 --> 00:11:42,608
Let this be a reminder that
you shouldn't act on your own!

204
00:11:42,692 --> 00:11:45,858
Besides, as coalition leader,
I shall command the frontlines--

205
00:11:45,942 --> 00:11:48,192
[LITTENHEIM] Sir. I don't
believe it's strategically sound

206
00:11:48,275 --> 00:11:50,275
to deploy yourself out there.

207
00:11:50,358 --> 00:11:52,317
No, that would
expose you, Commander.

208
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:56,483
Perhaps we should designate
a tactical specialist.

209
00:11:56,567 --> 00:11:57,858
[BRAUNSCHWEIG growls]

210
00:12:13,442 --> 00:12:15,150
[BRAUNSCHWEIG]
Admiral Merkatz.

211
00:12:15,233 --> 00:12:17,608
Please, take a seat.

212
00:12:17,692 --> 00:12:19,525
[MERKATZ] You may ask
as many times as you like,

213
00:12:19,608 --> 00:12:21,567
but my answer hasn't changed.

214
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:24,192
A struggle like this will
do more harm than good.

215
00:12:24,275 --> 00:12:26,817
Please reconsider engaging
in such a venture.

216
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,108
You're mistaken.

217
00:12:28,192 --> 00:12:30,067
This endeavor is a righteous
crusade to protect

218
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:33,275
the sovereignty of the
great Goldenbaum Dynasty.

219
00:12:33,358 --> 00:12:35,942
Withholding support.
Suggesting futility.

220
00:12:36,025 --> 00:12:38,108
That's an act of treason.

221
00:12:38,192 --> 00:12:41,233
[FLEGEL] And, not only would
that make you a traitor,

222
00:12:41,317 --> 00:12:44,067
it would implicate
your family as well.

223
00:12:48,358 --> 00:12:50,275
Flegel.

224
00:12:50,358 --> 00:12:53,442
It appears even the youth are
hungry with the desire to fight.

225
00:12:53,525 --> 00:12:55,317
The fine young folks
of our Empire demand

226
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,733
that we punish such treachery.

227
00:12:58,817 --> 00:13:01,025
Fine. Although
my abilities are modest,

228
00:13:01,108 --> 00:13:03,400
I accept your request.

229
00:13:03,483 --> 00:13:04,900
However...

230
00:13:08,025 --> 00:13:09,317
[SCHNEIDER]
He did agree to your conditions

231
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:13,525
to follow military regulations.
Is that inadequate?

232
00:13:13,608 --> 00:13:16,525
[MERKATZ chuckles]
Lieutenant Commander Schneider.

233
00:13:16,608 --> 00:13:18,233
You're naïve in your age.

234
00:13:18,317 --> 00:13:20,525
The duke's response
to my request was merely

235
00:13:20,608 --> 00:13:22,442
a cheap form of lip service.

236
00:13:22,525 --> 00:13:25,358
It's only a matter of time
before he despises me

237
00:13:25,442 --> 00:13:28,733
even more than he does
Marquis Lohengramm.

238
00:13:28,817 --> 00:13:30,317
That can't be.

239
00:13:31,817 --> 00:13:33,525
Privilege is
the worst poison of all

240
00:13:33,608 --> 00:13:36,150
because it rots away
a person's spirit.

241
00:13:36,233 --> 00:13:38,650
Of course, the higher nobility
has been steeping in it

242
00:13:38,733 --> 00:13:41,275
for dozens of generations now.

243
00:13:41,358 --> 00:13:43,442
The old game
of justifying themselves

244
00:13:43,525 --> 00:13:45,358
while blaming others
for their misdeeds

245
00:13:45,442 --> 00:13:47,442
has become instinctive to them.

246
00:13:47,525 --> 00:13:49,608
In the past I was blind to it.

247
00:13:49,692 --> 00:13:52,275
However, once I encountered
our men in the lower ranks,

248
00:13:52,358 --> 00:13:54,317
I began to understand.

249
00:13:59,567 --> 00:14:01,400
[NARRATOR]
In his entire life,

250
00:14:01,483 --> 00:14:04,150
Merkatz had never struggled
to find the right words

251
00:14:04,233 --> 00:14:06,108
as much as he did that night.

252
00:14:07,358 --> 00:14:09,067
[NARRATOR] The letter
he wrote was filled with love

253
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:11,108
in every sentence.

254
00:14:11,192 --> 00:14:14,317
For it was a farewell
to his wife and children.

255
00:14:17,108 --> 00:14:18,858
[BRAUNSCHWEIG]
Assassination?!

256
00:14:18,942 --> 00:14:20,775
Don't be ridiculous!

257
00:14:20,858 --> 00:14:22,817
I have over 3,000 noblemen

258
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,858
who all answered
my call to assemble.

259
00:14:24,942 --> 00:14:26,858
They've already begun to move.

260
00:14:26,942 --> 00:14:29,025
I'm taking the
righteous initiative.

261
00:14:29,108 --> 00:14:30,858
Why would you suggest
trying to assassinate--

Your Excellency, please listen!

263
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:34,817
I intend to defeat
that golden-haired brat

in a properly-fought
head-to-head confrontation

for all to see.

266

Once I emerge triumphantly,
my success will affirm

the strengths of my virtue
and ability beyond reproach!

And yet, you two
wish to sully my honor

with such a cowardly
recommendation?

270

[STREIT]
Not at all, sir!

271

the lives of all our people.

we win," you defeatist?!

their loyalty to

So. You admit it.

And why would you
suggest such a thing?

Because I knew
this would happen.

I wanted to prevent the
chaos of a useless war.

If only my lordship were willing

If I returned to my lordship,

he would immediately suspect me
of collusion and punish me.
