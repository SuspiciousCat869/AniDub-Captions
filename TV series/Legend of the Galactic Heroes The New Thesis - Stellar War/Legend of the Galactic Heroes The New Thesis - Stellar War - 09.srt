123

[NARRATOR] Three hundred years
ago in the Galactic Empire,

124
00:08:22,275 --> 00:08:25,942
on the bitterly
cold planet Altair VII,

125
00:08:26,025 --> 00:08:28,525
there was a young republican
who was being forced to work

126
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:31,192
like a slave in the mines.

127
00:08:31,275 --> 00:08:34,025
His name was Arle Heinessen.

128
00:08:34,108 --> 00:08:37,567
His deepest desire was to
escape Altair VII and start

129
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:41,025
a new nation with
a republican government.

130
00:08:41,108 --> 00:08:43,692
His only obstacle was
acquiring the materials

131
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:47,400
to build a spacecraft
that would carry people there.

132
00:08:47,483 --> 00:08:50,608
Apparently, one day,
he saw some children playing

133
00:08:50,692 --> 00:08:54,108
with boats they made out
of ice, and it came to him.

134
00:08:54,192 --> 00:08:56,817
He built ships out of
the unlimited supply of dry ice

135
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,900
on Altair VII,
and embarked on an

136
00:08:58,983 --> 00:09:00,150
exodus which became known as

137
00:09:00,233 --> 00:09:03,150
the "Long March of Ten-
Thousand Light Years."

138
00:09:03,233 --> 00:09:05,192
We are going to be
mimicking this legend

139
00:09:05,275 --> 00:09:08,775
about Arle Heinessen,
father of our nation.

140
00:09:08,858 --> 00:09:11,942
We've carved a dozen ice
floes out of Planet Srinagar.

141
00:09:12,025 --> 00:09:14,483
Each has a volume
of one cubic kilometer

142
00:09:14,567 --> 00:09:17,692
and weighs one billion tons.

143
00:09:17,775 --> 00:09:19,233
We then equipped
each of those floes

144
00:09:19,317 --> 00:09:21,275
with strong engines,
allowing them to fly

145
00:09:21,358 --> 00:09:23,025
at near light speed.

146
00:09:23,108 --> 00:09:25,858
An object's effective
mass increases with its speed,

147
00:09:25,942 --> 00:09:28,567
and significantly at
the speed of light.

148
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:31,233
So if a billion-ton ice floe
were to crash into something

149
00:09:31,317 --> 00:09:35,858
at that speed, no military
satellite would stand a chance.

150
00:09:37,067 --> 00:09:40,900
Also... The ice floes and
satellites are both unmanned.

151
00:09:40,983 --> 00:09:43,317
If this works, we can
take out Artemis's Necklace

152
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,150
without bloodshed.

153
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,942
I know you've
prepared 12 of them,

154
00:09:48,025 --> 00:09:50,983
but should we really
destroy every satellite?

155
00:09:51,067 --> 00:09:54,317
Shouldn't we at least keep
a few operational for later use?

156
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,900
There's no need.

157
00:09:55,983 --> 00:09:57,733
The very presence of those
things is what gave

158
00:09:57,817 --> 00:09:59,817
the insurgents the illusion
that they could pull off

159
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,942
a coup d'état.

160
00:10:02,025 --> 00:10:04,192
So we'll destroy

[GATTY] Artemis's Necklace...
is destroyed...

162
00:11:18,067 --> 00:11:20,733
[GREENHILL]
This is the end of the road.

163
00:11:20,817 --> 00:11:22,275
We've lost this fight.

164
00:11:22,358 --> 00:11:24,650
Our military
revolution has failed.

165
00:11:24,733 --> 00:11:26,358
We need to accept that.

166
00:11:26,442 --> 00:11:28,483
No, it isn't over yet!

167
00:11:28,567 --> 00:11:30,608
We still have Heinessen's
billion citizens,

168
00:11:30,692 --> 00:11:33,483
as well as its key military
and political personnel!

169
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:35,150
There's a chance
we can still negotiate--

170
00:11:35,233 --> 00:11:37,358
Give it up.

171
00:11:37,442 --> 00:11:40,483
Resisting any further would not
only prove to be futile,

172
00:11:40,567 --> 00:11:41,942
it would hinder
the reunification

173
00:11:42,025 --> 00:11:44,025
of the nation and its people.

174
00:11:46,275 --> 00:11:49,942
[GATTY] In that case... What are
we all supposed to do now?

175
00:11:50,025 --> 00:11:53,275
Surrender and face
the inevitable punishment?

176
00:11:53,358 --> 00:11:56,108
[GREENHILL] Those who want to
are welcome to do so.

177
00:11:56,192 --> 00:11:57,775
I choose another path.

178
00:11:59,567 --> 00:12:04,567
But there is one final thing
I must see to before then.

179
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:06,942
We cannot leave
behind any evidence,

180
00:12:07,025 --> 00:12:10,275
any witnesses to the fact
that our noble uprising

181
00:12:10,358 --> 00:12:12,817
was secretly a scheme
by the Empire.

182
00:12:16,567 --> 00:12:19,317
Rear Admiral Lynch,
believe it or not,

183
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,817
I've always had
high hopes for you.

184
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,942
I have ever since cadet school,
when you were just

185
00:12:24,025 --> 00:12:26,442
two classes behind me.

186
00:12:26,525 --> 00:12:28,775
What transpired
at El Facil nine years ago

187
00:12:28,858 --> 00:12:31,942
was truly regrettable.

188
00:12:32,025 --> 00:12:33,525
I thought of you.

189
00:12:33,608 --> 00:12:35,733
I had hoped that what we were
doing here could help to restore

190
00:12:35,817 --> 00:12:38,775
your honor, even if
only by a small margin.

191
00:12:40,858 --> 00:12:44,775
[chuckles] Well, you never did
have very good judgement.

You realize I only
did that to save him

198
00:13:09,858 --> 00:13:12,733
from losing his honor, right?

199
00:13:12,817 --> 00:13:15,608
Couldn't even figure
out that much?

200
00:13:15,692 --> 00:13:18,192
He got to go out with a bang.

201
00:13:18,275 --> 00:13:21,108
It's better than living
and being put on trial.

"A man's honor."

203

[EVENS]
I, Alliance Navy Captain Evens,

206
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:41,525
am speaking on behalf of
the Military Council chairman.

207
00:13:41,608 --> 00:13:44,025
There's no point
in attacking us.

208
00:13:44,108 --> 00:13:45,775
We have accepted our defeat

209
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:49,025
and will no longer respond
with pointless resistance.

210
00:13:49,108 --> 00:13:51,067
Everything is over.

211
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:53,525
I'm glad to hear
of your decision.

212
00:13:53,608 --> 00:13:56,025
However, I can't help but wonder
why you're speaking on

213
00:13:56,108 --> 00:13:58,025
behalf of Admiral Greenhill.

214
00:13:58,108 --> 00:14:00,233
Where is he?
I don't see him there.

215
00:14:01,775 --> 00:14:04,317
He made the decision
to take his own life.

216
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,400
It was a perfect ending.

217
00:14:06,483 --> 00:14:08,400
[YANG gasps]

218
00:14:08,483 --> 00:14:10,317
[EVENS]
Admiral Yang.

219
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:13,692
You know our objective was to
purify our democratic republic,

220
00:14:13,775 --> 00:14:16,775
and once we had, to wipe the
Galactic Empire's autocracy

221
00:14:16,858 --> 00:14:18,733
out of existence.

222
00:14:18,817 --> 00:14:22,733
It is unfortunate that
we failed to realize this ideal.

223
00:14:22,817 --> 00:14:24,983
Do you understand, Admiral Yang?

224
00:14:25,067 --> 00:14:28,775
You have just contributed to
the survival of autocracy!

225
00:14:28,858 --> 00:14:31,525
And what exactly is autocracy?

226
00:14:31,608 --> 00:14:35,442
Is it not unelected politicians?
Zero representation?

227
00:14:35,525 --> 00:14:37,067
Taking away freedoms?

228
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:39,608
Controlling the public
through violence?

229
00:14:39,692 --> 00:14:42,358
Because right now,
that's precisely what

230
00:14:42,442 --> 00:14:44,275
you're doing on Heinessen.

231
00:14:44,358 --> 00:14:47,567
You are the autocracy.
Or am I wrong?

232
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:49,150
[EVENS]
You are!

233
00:14:49,233 --> 00:14:51,733
Our current power
is a temporary measure.

234
00:14:51,817 --> 00:14:55,233
The government was corrupt--what
other way was there to fix that?

235
00:14:55,317 --> 00:14:57,275
Corruption in government
doesn't simply come down

236
00:14:57,358 --> 00:14:59,692
to politicians taking bribes.

237
00:14:59,775 --> 00:15:01,692
That is corruption
of the individual.

238
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:04,650
Government corruption is a state
of affairs where politicians

239
00:15:04,733 --> 00:15:07,108
are above criticism
for such an act.

240
00:15:07,192 --> 00:15:10,400
Your insurgency ordered
the regulation of free speech.

241
00:15:10,483 --> 00:15:12,275
Don't you think that
by that action alone,

242
00:15:12,358 --> 00:15:15,275
you've lost the right to condemn
the Empire's autocracy,

243
00:15:15,358 --> 00:15:16,400
as well as the corruption

244
00:15:16,483 --> 00:15:19,900
of the Alliance's
current government?

245
00:15:19,983 --> 00:15:22,025
We were putting
our lives and reputations

246
00:15:22,108 --> 00:15:23,608
on the line.

247
00:15:23,692 --> 00:15:26,567
I won't allow you to drag our
names through the mud for that.

248
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:29,650
Our cause was not one
lacking in righteousness.

249
00:15:29,733 --> 00:15:32,650
The only things we did lack
were luck and capability.

250
00:15:32,733 --> 00:15:35,817
Just that. Nothing more.

251
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:38,067
Is that what you believe?

252
00:15:39,442 --> 00:15:41,733

253
00:15:46,692 --> 00:15:48,108
It's unfortunate
he couldn't admit

254
00:15:48,192 --> 00:15:51,025
to his own mistakes,
even in the bitter end.

No, two hours to myself?

259
00:16:06,483 --> 00:16:08,608
I know that I'll
be able to recover from this,

260
00:16:08,692 --> 00:16:11,692
and get back on my own
two feet, but I don't

261

believe that I can
do so immediately.

00:19:49,358 --> 00:19:51,567
[RUBINSKY]
You seem to be in a bad mood.

320
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:54,150
[KONEV]
No, I always look like this.

321
00:19:54,233 --> 00:19:55,983
It certainly isn't
because I'm with you,

322
00:19:56,067 --> 00:19:57,567
if that's what you're thinking.

323
00:19:57,650 --> 00:19:58,942
You transported members of

324
00:19:59,025 --> 00:20:01,692
the Church of Terra to Earth,
isn't that right?

325
00:20:01,775 --> 00:20:02,817
[KONEV]
Yes, sir.

326
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,608
Considering the dangers
of carrying them

327
00:20:04,692 --> 00:20:06,192
through a battlefield,
I hear the

328
00:20:06,275 --> 00:20:08,650
resulting gains
were hardly worth it.

329
00:20:08,733 --> 00:20:11,483
Is that the reason
you seem so displeased?

330
00:20:11,567 --> 00:20:14,192
[KONEV chuckles]
Maybe.

331
00:20:14,275 --> 00:20:18,400
[RUBINSKY] Incidentally, what do
you think about the Terraists?

332
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:20,192
[KONEV]
I'm not quite sure.

333
00:20:20,275 --> 00:20:22,317
But in terms of
religion in general,

334
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,567
I think poor people
believing God to be fair

335
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:27,983
and just seems like
an obvious contradiction.

336
00:20:28,067 --> 00:20:31,775
It's because God is biased that
the poverty-stricken exist.

337
00:20:31,858 --> 00:20:33,483
Interesting thought.

338
00:20:33,567 --> 00:20:35,942
I take it you don't
believe in God, then?

339
00:20:36,025 --> 00:20:39,108
Nope, not even in the slightest.

340
00:20:39,192 --> 00:20:41,942
Whoever came up with
the concept of God

341
00:20:42,025 --> 00:20:44,650
was the greatest con
artist in history.

342
00:20:44,733 --> 00:20:46,942
I only admire
that person's imagination

343
00:20:47,025 --> 00:20:48,483
and business sense.

344
00:20:48,567 --> 00:20:51,275
From ancient to current times,
the wealthiest ones

345
00:20:51,358 --> 00:20:54,108
in every nation have
always been nobles,

346
00:20:54,192 --> 00:20:57,317
landowners, and
religious organizations.

347
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:00,067
That's certainly
a fascinating viewpoint.

348
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:03,733
Is it your own original one, or
have you adopted someone else's?

349
00:21:03,817 --> 00:21:05,275
The latter.

350
00:21:05,358 --> 00:21:07,567
I heard most of it
when I was a child.

351
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:10,358
It was 16 or 17 years ago
when I was traveling

352
00:21:10,442 --> 00:21:12,733
from planet to planet
with my father.

353
00:21:12,817 --> 00:21:14,358
One day,
I met another boy who lived

354
00:21:14,442 --> 00:21:16,733
in similar circumstances.

355
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:19,858
He was two years older than me,
very smart for his age,

356
00:21:19,942 --> 00:21:21,858
and spent most of
his time thinking.

357
00:21:21,942 --> 00:21:23,983
All those were
things he said to me.

358
00:21:24,067 --> 00:21:27,442
Oh? What was
this philosopher's name?

359
00:21:27,525 --> 00:21:29,358
It was Yang Wen-li.

360
00:21:29,442 --> 00:21:31,900
I hear he's now found work
in the hopeless field

361
00:21:31,983 --> 00:21:34,192
of military service.

362
00:21:34,275 --> 00:21:36,900
A free man such
as myself can't help but pity

363
00:21:36,983 --> 00:21:39,233
the poor fellow.

364
00:21:39,317 --> 00:21:41,275
Captain Boris Konev.

365
00:21:41,358 --> 00:21:43,358
[KONEV]
Yes, sir?

366
00:21:43,442 --> 00:21:45,358
The government of
the Dominion of Fezzan

367
00:21:45,442 --> 00:21:48,400
would like to delegate
a momentous duty to you.

368
00:21:51,275 --> 00:21:52,733
[KONEV]
What?

369
00:21:56,858 --> 00:21:58,067
[MARINESK]
Hey.

370
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,358
We got a notice from
the energy agency earlier.

371
00:22:00,442 --> 00:22:02,567
They said we'd never
have to worry about fuel

372
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:04,692
for the Berezka again.

373
00:22:04,775 --> 00:22:07,567
What kind of magic
did you use to pull that off?

374
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:10,442
[KONEV] Just sold myself
to the government.

375
00:22:10,525 --> 00:22:12,525
They're sending me
to the Free Planets Alliance

376
00:22:12,608 --> 00:22:14,733
as some sort of
intelligence officer.

377
00:22:14,817 --> 00:22:16,150
[MARINESK]
Oh.

378
00:22:16,233 --> 00:22:18,775
[KONEV] You know, the one
thing the Konev family was

379
00:22:18,858 --> 00:22:20,608
most proud of was
that we've produced

380
00:22:20,692 --> 00:22:24,483
no criminals nor
bureaucrats in 200 years!

381
00:22:24,567 --> 00:22:26,858
We're free citizens! Free!

382
00:22:26,942 --> 00:22:30,192
And now they want me
to be a spy, of all things!

383
00:22:30,275 --> 00:22:31,942
That's both of those at once!

384
00:22:32,025 --> 00:22:34,067
[MARINESK] Wasn't it
"Intelligence Officer"?

385
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:35,858
Not "spy"?

386
00:22:35,942 --> 00:22:38,150
Changing the name
doesn't fix anything!

387
00:22:38,233 --> 00:22:40,025
If you just called
cancer a cold,

388
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:42,358
would that mean
that it's not cancer?

389
00:22:42,442 --> 00:22:45,358
If you got bit by
a lion and called it a mouse,

390
00:22:45,442 --> 00:22:46,900
would you bleed any less?

391
00:22:46,983 --> 00:22:49,150
They already looked into it
and knew I'd met Yang Wen-li

392
00:22:49,233 --> 00:22:52,192
before I even mentioned it.

393
00:22:52,275 --> 00:22:53,733
What a joke!

394
00:22:53,817 --> 00:22:56,858
Maybe I should just contact Yang
and tell him about all this.

395
00:22:56,942 --> 00:22:58,775
[MARINESK]
I don't think that'll work.

396
00:22:58,858 --> 00:23:01,150
They'll have eyes
on you at all times.

397
00:23:01,233 --> 00:23:05,067
They'll watch what you do
and punish you if necessary.

398
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:07,525
That damn Black Fox
probably thinks he's doing me

399
00:23:07,608 --> 00:23:10,900
a favor by giving me this
cushy government position.

400
00:23:10,983 --> 00:23:12,567
Fine, then. Let him.

401
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:14,817
He can keep on
believing that for now.

402
00:23:20,067 --> 00:23:22,067
[KONEV]
Tch! Damn that Rubinsky!

403
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:24,525
I'm going to take him
down one day!

404
00:23:24,608 --> 00:23:26,567
[MARINESK]
What are you, a child?

405
