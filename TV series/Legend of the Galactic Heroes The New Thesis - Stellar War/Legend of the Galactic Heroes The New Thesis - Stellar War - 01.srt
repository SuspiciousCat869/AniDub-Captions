Most of their surviving fleets

I won't have
Bittenfeld punished.

315
00:18:13,442 --> 00:18:16,067
Would you please
relay that to him?

316
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:18,442
I can't be the one
to do that for you.

317
00:18:20,442 --> 00:18:22,650
[REINHARD] You're right,
it's meaningless if

318
00:18:22,733 --> 00:18:24,525
it doesn't come from me.

319
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:29,650
Tell me, Kircheis.

320
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:32,192
Yes, what is it, Reinhard?

321
00:18:33,858 --> 00:18:37,067
Do you believe I can seize
this universe as my own?

322
00:18:38,483 --> 00:18:41,150
If you are not capable
of that feat, no one is.

323
00:18:41,233 --> 00:18:43,358
Go forth and make it yours.

324
00:19:02,275 --> 00:19:05,817
[footsteps approaching]

325
00:19:07,817 --> 00:19:11,025
S'all right, I'm just resting--
forgive my appearance.

326
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:14,233
Yes, sir. Would you
like some tea?

327
00:19:14,317 --> 00:19:18,442
[YANG] Sure, with plenty of
brandy in it, if you please.

328
00:19:18,525 --> 00:19:20,400
Right.

329
00:19:20,483 --> 00:19:21,608
[YANG]
Sub-lieutenant.

330
00:19:21,692 --> 00:19:22,900
Huh?

331
00:19:22,983 --> 00:19:25,692
[YANG] I've studied
a fair amount of history.

332
00:19:25,775 --> 00:19:29,150
And one thing I've learned is
that in every human society,

333
00:19:29,233 --> 00:19:32,108
there are two main
schools of thought.

334
00:19:32,192 --> 00:19:33,733
There are those who believe
there exists something

335
00:19:33,817 --> 00:19:35,900
more valuable than a life.

336
00:19:35,983 --> 00:19:39,942
And those who believe that
nothing is more important.

337
00:19:40,025 --> 00:19:41,567
When people go to war,
they use the former

338
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:45,650
as an excuse,
and when they stop fighting,

339
00:19:45,733 --> 00:19:48,442
they give the latter
as the reason.

340
00:19:48,525 --> 00:19:50,192
This has been true
for hundreds--

341
00:19:50,275 --> 00:19:53,067
no, thousands of years.

342
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,650
I wonder...

343
00:19:54,733 --> 00:19:58,317
Will that continue to be the
case for a thousand more?

344
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,067
I'm not sure...

345
00:20:01,817 --> 00:20:05,733
[YANG] No, nevermind--
humanity as a whole.

346
00:20:05,817 --> 00:20:07,650
The real question is...

347
00:20:07,733 --> 00:20:10,733
Can I do anything to justify
all the blood I've spilled?

348
00:20:10,817 --> 00:20:12,317
Was it worth it?

349
00:20:14,025 --> 00:20:17,483
[YANG] Uh. I'm sorry, that was
weird to say, d-disregard that.

350
00:20:17,567 --> 00:20:19,942
Oh, please,
it's perfectly all right.

351
00:20:20,025 --> 00:20:23,025
If you'll excuse me, I'll go get
that tea and a bit of brandy.

352
00:20:23,108 --> 00:20:24,150
Lots of it.

353
00:20:24,233 --> 00:20:26,483
[FREDERICA]
Yes. Lots of it.

354
00:20:40,358 --> 00:20:41,692
[NARRATOR]
Accepting responsibility

355
00:20:41,775 --> 00:20:43,567
for the worst defeat in history,

356
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:46,317
the entire Alliance High
Council resigned.

357
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,858
When Job Trunicht,
one of the members who voted

358
00:20:48,942 --> 00:20:51,692
in opposition to the invasion,
left his position

359
00:20:51,775 --> 00:20:54,650
as National Defense Committee
Chairman, he was immediately

360
00:20:54,733 --> 00:20:57,275
appointed as the head
of the interim government.

361
00:20:59,275 --> 00:21:00,692
[NARRATOR]
In the military division,

362
00:21:00,775 --> 00:21:03,983
Fleet Admiral Sithole, the
Integrated Tactical Operations

363
00:21:04,067 --> 00:21:06,525
Center Chief,
and Fleet Admiral Lobos,

364
00:21:06,608 --> 00:21:09,608
the Space Fleet supreme
commander both resigned.

365
00:21:09,692 --> 00:21:11,650
Admiral Dwight Greenhill
was relegated

366
00:21:11,733 --> 00:21:14,108
to inspector general of the
National Defense Committee

367
00:21:14,192 --> 00:21:16,567
General Secretariat and
was then removed from

368
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,817
the military's front line.

369
00:21:20,025 --> 00:21:21,692
[NARRATOR]
Rear Admiral Alex Caselnes,

370
00:21:21,775 --> 00:21:24,525
who took responsibility for
the supply line failure,

371
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:26,233
was sent far away
from Heinessen,

372
00:21:26,317 --> 00:21:28,067
to the frontier lands.

373
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:31,108
Unfortunately, this move took
him a great distance away

374
00:21:31,192 --> 00:21:33,108
from his family.

375
00:21:33,192 --> 00:21:36,067
Former operations staff
officer Commodore Falk

376
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:40,192
was reassigned to reserve
duty after medical treatment.

377
00:21:40,275 --> 00:21:42,275
The First Fleet
commander, Kubersly,

378
00:21:42,358 --> 00:21:45,733
became the new Operations
Center Chief, and Bewcock,

379
00:21:45,817 --> 00:21:47,608
after a promotion to Admiral,

380
00:21:47,692 --> 00:21:50,358
was named the new Space
Fleet Commander-in-Chief

381
00:21:52,358 --> 00:21:53,733
[NARRATOR] There was
much discussion as to what

382
00:21:53,817 --> 00:21:56,608
to do with Yang, and
a final decision was not made

383
00:21:56,692 --> 00:22:00,275
until he returned from his
requested three-week vacation.

384
00:22:00,358 --> 00:22:02,692
He was promoted to
Iserlohn Fortress commander

385
00:22:02,775 --> 00:22:04,317
and garrison commander.

386
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,650
On top of that, he received
a promotion to Admiral.

387
00:22:07,733 --> 00:22:09,775
His first orders were
to immediately relocate

388
00:22:09,858 --> 00:22:11,733
to Iserlohn Fortress.

389
00:22:12,817 --> 00:22:14,567
[NARRATOR] There he'd be
joined by his adjutant,

390
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:16,733
Lieutenant Frederica Greenhill,

391
00:22:16,817 --> 00:22:20,067
garrison vice commander,
Rear Admiral Edwin Fischer,

392
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:24,858
Fortress Defense Commander
Commodore Walter von Schönkopf,

393
00:22:24,942 --> 00:22:27,733
chief of staff,
Rear Admiral Murai.

394
00:22:27,817 --> 00:22:30,983
vice chief of staff,
Commodore Fyodor Patrichev,

395
00:22:31,067 --> 00:22:34,150
division commander,
Rear Admiral Dusty Attenborough,

396
00:22:34,233 --> 00:22:37,275
division commander,
Rear Admiral Nguyen Van Huu,

397
00:22:37,358 --> 00:22:39,858
staff officer, Commander Lao,

398
00:22:39,942 --> 00:22:41,817
first Fortress Space
Squadron captain,

399
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:44,192
Lieutenant Commander
Olivier Po-plin,

400
00:22:44,275 --> 00:22:46,192
second Fortress
Space Squadron captain,

401
00:22:46,275 --> 00:22:49,858
Lieutenant Commander Ivan
Konev, and Julian Mintz,

402
00:22:49,942 --> 00:22:52,358
who joined the military
as a paid civilian.

403
00:22:54,192 --> 00:22:57,233
[NARRATOR] As the new Yang fleet
came together to take control

404
00:22:57,317 --> 00:23:00,733
of Iserlohn Fortress,
the fortress commander's

405
00:23:00,817 --> 00:23:05,233
main concern was the
movement of the Imperial Navy.

406
00:23:05,317 --> 00:23:08,692
Now that the Alliance Navy
was in a weakened state,

407
00:23:08,775 --> 00:23:12,025
he feared their enemies
might go on the offensive.

408
00:23:14,483 --> 00:23:18,067
[NARRATOR] However, his
worries were unnecessary...

409
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:24,400
[NARRATOR]
...due to the unexpected death

410
00:23:24,483 --> 00:23:27,067
of Kaiser Friedrich the fourth.
