Why are you all so shocked?

Fredrich may have

[OBERSTEIN] Friedrich has
one direct male descendant.

However, the boy is

an influential noble family.

Two of the emperor's

Out of all the influential

there are any with unwed

in marrying my daughter?

of them a proposal.

to the throne and their son

That's a masterful idea.

Do tell.

You need only continue
to work as you have.

As both minister of state.

And as the Empire's
acting Prime Minister.

143
00:10:08,442 --> 00:10:11,775
You're suggesting
I adhere to convention.

144
00:10:11,858 --> 00:10:14,817
That would be
my preference, of course.

145
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:18,483
But even if I chose Master Erwin
Josef as emperor on the grounds

146
00:10:18,567 --> 00:10:20,983
that he's the only

147

I could not protect him from
Braunschweig and Littenheim.

148

There's no way they would give

00:11:07,192 --> 00:11:10,567
I guess Oberstein knew
what he was talking about.

161
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:13,900
Tell me, what are your
thoughts on that man?

162
00:11:13,983 --> 00:11:17,275
I honestly dislike him,
but he's sharp.

163
00:11:19,317 --> 00:11:20,483
[MITTERMEYER sighs]

164
00:11:20,567 --> 00:11:23,733
What's the matter?
Something's bothering you.

165
00:11:23,817 --> 00:11:25,858
It's hard for me
to put into words.

166
00:11:25,942 --> 00:11:29,067
But at times when the Admiral
is talking with Oberstein,

167
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:31,775
his energy and demeanor
seem completely changed,

168
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:34,608
and it becomes hard to
recognize him in those moments.

169
00:11:35,983 --> 00:11:39,567
[MITTERMEYER]
He becomes... a stranger.

170
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:41,233
Perhaps it's all in my head.

171
00:11:41,317 --> 00:11:42,775
He must want
the same things we do

172
00:11:42,858 --> 00:11:45,025
if he is serving alongside us.

173
00:11:45,108 --> 00:11:49,358
While our goals appear to align,
our ideologies clearly do not.

174
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:51,358
Consider the way
we view the Admiral.

175
00:11:51,442 --> 00:11:54,233
The difference is just
like night and day.

176
00:11:54,317 --> 00:11:55,775
That's true.

177
00:11:55,858 --> 00:11:59,358
I suppose we should just
focus on our own jobs, right?

178
00:11:59,442 --> 00:12:00,650
[REUENTHAL]
Hmph.

179
00:12:12,358 --> 00:12:15,067
[NARRATOR] When young Erwin
Josef's succession to the throne

180
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:20,233
was announced, the reaction from
the nobility was as expected.

181
00:12:20,317 --> 00:12:24,275
They were astonished,
disappointed,

182
00:12:24,358 --> 00:12:26,525
and maddened with rage.

183
00:12:35,442 --> 00:12:39,192
[FLEGEL] Stupid brat.
Stupid brat. Stupid brat.

184
00:12:39,275 --> 00:12:44,067
That stupid brat.
Utter humiliation.

185
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:46,942
A mockery. They'll all pay...

186
00:12:47,025 --> 00:12:48,900
Damn golden-haired brat!

187
00:13:08,108 --> 00:13:09,317
[RUBINSKY]
Grand Bishop.

188
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:12,525
I hope I find you in
good spirits this evening.

189
00:13:12,608 --> 00:13:15,983
[BISHOP] I've no reason
to be in "good spirits."

190
00:13:16,067 --> 00:13:19,025
My heart will feel no joy
until Earth is revered by

191
00:13:19,108 --> 00:13:22,483
all of mankind, just as
it was in the glorious,

192
00:13:22,567 --> 00:13:24,567
distant days of old.

193
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:25,775
[RUBINSKY]
Of course.

194
00:13:25,858 --> 00:13:28,233
[BISHOP] Terra is
the cradle of Humanity,

195
00:13:28,317 --> 00:13:30,025
the center of
the universe,

196
00:13:30,108 --> 00:13:32,567
and she shall reign
supreme over all.

197
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:35,775
Those savage ingrates, who
abandoned our mother planet,

198
00:13:35,858 --> 00:13:39,067
will soon realize the truth
within the next three years.

199
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:43,025
[gasps] Things are moving
faster than I expected.

200
00:13:43,108 --> 00:13:45,525
[BISHOP] The flow of
history is accelerating.

201
00:13:45,608 --> 00:13:48,192
The convergence of political
and military power

202
00:13:48,275 --> 00:13:51,150
in the Galactic Empire
and Free Planets Alliance

203
00:13:51,233 --> 00:13:53,442
has been inching forward.

204
00:13:53,525 --> 00:13:56,233
A surge of citizens
is on the horizon.

205
00:13:56,317 --> 00:13:59,567
The time is ripe for a mass
movement among the people.

206
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:02,067
I've left that task
with you Fezzanese.

207
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:04,025
I trust you've made no mistakes.

208
00:14:04,108 --> 00:14:06,067
[RUBINSKY]
All is done, Your Lordship.

209
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:09,358
[BISHOP] Fezzan occupies
a unique position.

210
00:14:09,442 --> 00:14:11,483
It is for this reason
our ancestors sent

211
00:14:11,567 --> 00:14:13,233
Terra's faithful there.

212
00:14:13,317 --> 00:14:15,942
Instructing them to accumulate
vast amounts of wealth

213
00:14:16,025 --> 00:14:18,400
and economic might.

214
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:19,525
Rubinsky.

215
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:21,692
Yes?

216
00:14:21,775 --> 00:14:24,025
[BISHOP]
Do not betray me.

217
00:14:24,108 --> 00:14:28,275
No. I swear to you I would never
dream of it, Your Lordship.

218
00:14:28,358 --> 00:14:30,483
After all, were it not
for your gracious support,

219
00:14:30,567 --> 00:14:33,483
I never would have become
leader of this dominion.

220
00:14:33,567 --> 00:14:35,858
I am not an ingrate.

221
00:14:35,942 --> 00:14:38,358
[BISHOP]
Good. Then all is well.

222
00:14:38,442 --> 00:14:41,442
That praiseworthiness
will surely protect you.

223
00:14:41,525 --> 00:14:42,942
[RUBINSKY]
Thank you.

224
00:14:55,775 --> 00:14:57,525
[RUBINSKY sighs]

225
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:05,150
[RUBINSKY] I wonder. Who will
be the last one standing?

226
00:15:05,233 --> 00:15:11,192
The Empire, the Alliance,
the Church of Terra?

227
00:15:11,275 --> 00:15:13,858
Or perhaps...

228
00:15:13,942 --> 00:15:16,150
...it will be me.

229
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:20,775

Your Highness.

00:15:35,233 --> 00:15:36,942
It's time to get ready.

00:15:37,275 --> 00:15:41,733
[trumpets blare]

237
00:15:41,817 --> 00:15:45,567
[NARRATOR] Out of respect for
Erwin Josef the Second's age,

238
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:49,108
his coronation as emperor was
abridged and the ceremony

239
00:15:49,192 --> 00:15:51,567
was a brief affair.

240
00:15:57,942 --> 00:16:01,317
[NARRATOR] By order of the
new regent, Duke Lichtenlade,

241
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,358
Reinhard was given a promotion.

242
00:16:03,442 --> 00:16:06,442
His rank rising from
count to marquis.

243
00:16:06,525 --> 00:16:09,442
That was also how he
came to occupy the seat

244
00:16:09,525 --> 00:16:13,275
of Commander-in-Chief of
the Imperial Space Fleet.

245
00:16:13,358 --> 00:16:16,108
Reinhard then promoted
Kircheis two ranks,

246
00:16:16,192 --> 00:16:18,358
to the position of high admiral.

247
00:16:18,442 --> 00:16:20,567
Appointing the red head
to serve alongside him

248
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:23,525
as the Imperial Space
Fleet's vice commander.

249
00:16:31,483 --> 00:16:33,983
[OBERSTEIN] It's nice you have
a long-time friend at your side,

250
00:16:34,067 --> 00:16:36,650
and a capable
second-in-command is great.

251
00:16:36,733 --> 00:16:38,942
But, the same man
serving both roles

252
00:16:39,025 --> 00:16:41,275
is dangerous and nepotistic.

253
00:16:41,358 --> 00:16:43,858
[REINHARD]
Watch your tongue, Oberstein.

254
00:16:43,942 --> 00:16:45,942
My decision has been made.

255
00:16:57,692 --> 00:17:00,692
[NARRATOR] As for Oberstein,
he was promoted to vice admiral

256
00:17:00,775 --> 00:17:03,483
and appointed to the concurrent
positions of chief of staff

257
00:17:03,567 --> 00:17:06,150
of the Imperial Space Fleet,
and chief director of

258
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:09,025
the Lohengramm Fleet
Admiral's Mansion.

259
00:17:09,108 --> 00:17:12,025
With Reinhard's rise
to commander-in-chief.

260
00:17:12,108 --> 00:17:15,108
Mückenberger left the
Imperial Space Fleet

261
00:17:15,192 --> 00:17:17,317
and retired from the military.

262
00:17:46,192 --> 00:17:48,317
I tried to resign
back during the fall

263
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,067
of Iserlohn Fortress.
I'm not a fool.

264
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:56,150
I knew it was only a matter
of time before this day came.

265
00:17:56,233 --> 00:17:59,775
I would guess that
you're not surprised, either.

266
00:18:58,192 --> 00:18:59,400
[ALL chuckle]

267
00:19:08,483 --> 00:19:10,567
[REINHARD]
Is it to your liking?

268
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:15,233
You did make it clear you wanted
the smallest mansion possible.

269
00:19:15,317 --> 00:19:17,317
Thank you so much, Reinhard.

270
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:20,817
Just as I had heard.
It's a splendid home.

271
00:19:27,442 --> 00:19:30,400
[REINHARD] The hard times and
suffering have come to an end.

272
00:19:30,483 --> 00:19:31,733
[gasps]

273
00:19:34,567 --> 00:19:36,692
From this day forth,

274
00:19:36,775 --> 00:19:38,608
I pray you will be happy.

275
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,692
[REINHARD] The coronation's
only the beginning.

276
00:19:56,775 --> 00:19:58,817
It's unlikely the nobles
will simply kneel before

277
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:02,733
their new ruler.
We can expect conflict.

278
00:20:02,817 --> 00:20:06,358
The resulting battle may
divide the Empire in two.

279
00:20:06,442 --> 00:20:08,192
I've been consulting
with both Mittermeyer

280
00:20:08,275 --> 00:20:10,983
and Reuenthal regarding
all of your concerns,

281
00:20:11,067 --> 00:20:14,275
and we've made great strides
in formulating a new strategy.

282
00:20:14,358 --> 00:20:16,483
Although, there
is another matter

283
00:20:16,567 --> 00:20:18,567
that I'm still worried about.

284
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:21,442
[REINHARD] You're wondering what
the rebels' next move might be.

285
00:20:21,525 --> 00:20:22,525
I am.

286
00:20:22,608 --> 00:20:24,525
There's nothing
for you to fret about.

287
00:20:24,608 --> 00:20:26,275
I have an something in mind.

288
00:20:26,358 --> 00:20:30,025
No matter how clever Admiral
Yang Wen-li's tactics may be,

289
00:20:30,108 --> 00:20:33,442
I came up with a plan to
ensure he can't leave Iserlohn.

290
00:20:33,525 --> 00:20:34,733
Which is?

291
00:20:36,275 --> 00:20:38,483
Essentially, an exchange

292
00:20:39,942 --> 00:20:41,983
[inaudible]

293
00:20:59,025 --> 00:21:01,108
[JULIAN humming]

294
00:21:10,067 --> 00:21:11,567
[humming continues]

295
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:15,483
[YANG] To think, a five-year old
child would sit on the throne.

296
00:21:15,567 --> 00:21:18,275
Discontent is sure to be
brewing in the Empire,

297
00:21:18,358 --> 00:21:20,275
meaning a civil war is coming.

298
00:21:26,817 --> 00:21:29,358
I can feel the temptation.

299
00:21:29,442 --> 00:21:30,442
Huh?

300
00:21:30,525 --> 00:21:33,983
[YANG]
Oh, nothing. Thinking out loud.

301
00:21:34,067 --> 00:21:35,483
It's interesting how people act

302
00:21:35,567 --> 00:21:37,233
when they only
care about winning.

303
00:21:37,317 --> 00:21:39,608
Their bottom line
completely vanishes.

304
00:21:46,858 --> 00:21:49,692
Thanks, Julian. By the way,

305
00:21:49,775 --> 00:21:52,692
I hear Schönkopf's been giving
you shooting lessons lately.

306
00:21:52,775 --> 00:21:53,942
How's that been going?

307
00:21:54,025 --> 00:21:55,817
Seems I've got a knack for it.

308
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,942
At least, that's what
the commodore says.

309
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:00,608
Yeah? Color me impressed.

310
00:22:00,692 --> 00:22:01,900
Y'know, when I think about it,

311
00:22:01,983 --> 00:22:04,233
you hardly practice
marksmanship at all.

312
00:22:04,317 --> 00:22:05,358
Is that really okay?

313
00:22:05,442 --> 00:22:06,900
[laughs]

314
00:22:06,983 --> 00:22:08,775
Well, unlike you,
apparently, I don't have

315
00:22:08,858 --> 00:22:10,192
any talent for it.

316
00:22:10,275 --> 00:22:11,692
In that case,

317
00:22:11,775 --> 00:22:13,900
how are you supposed to protect
yourself in an emergency?

318
00:22:13,983 --> 00:22:16,317
If a commanding
officer has to take up firearms

319
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,942
to defend himself, it's already
too late for them to win

320
00:22:19,025 --> 00:22:21,067
the fight, much less
an entire war.

321
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:23,442
I generally try to
avoid those situations.

322
00:22:23,525 --> 00:22:25,442
Things are easier that way

323
00:22:26,983 --> 00:22:28,192
That settles it.

324
00:22:28,275 --> 00:22:31,150
Okay, then from now on,
I'll protect you!

325
00:22:31,233 --> 00:22:32,483
I'm counting on it.

326
00:22:32,567 --> 00:22:33,483
[JULIAN]
Of course!

327
00:22:33,567 --> 00:22:36,108
[BOTH laugh]

328
00:22:36,192 --> 00:22:38,317
[NARRATOR] As the collective
thoughts of the universe's

329
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,608
people mingle, another
page turns in the history

330
00:22:41,692 --> 00:22:43,358
of the galaxy.

331
00:23:08,942 --> 00:23:14,483
[NARRATOR] In the year
UC 796, or IC 487,

332
00:23:14,567 --> 00:23:19,733
neither Marquis Reinhard
von Lohengramm, nor Yang Wen-li,

333
00:23:19,817 --> 00:23:23,233
could foresee the complicated
futures that lie ahead of them.

334
00:24:59,025 --> 00:25:02,150
