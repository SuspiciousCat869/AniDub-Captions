00:00:10,567 --> 00:00:13,317
[NARRATOR] The Iserlohn Corridor
is a long and narrow tunnel

2
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:16,483
of safety running through an
unnavigable stretch of space

3
00:00:16,567 --> 00:00:20,692
between the Galactic Empire
and the Free Planets Alliance.

4
00:00:20,775 --> 00:00:23,192
Within this pathway
lies an artificial planet

5
00:00:23,275 --> 00:00:25,692
with a diameter
of 60 kilometers--

6
00:00:25,775 --> 00:00:28,400
Iserlohn Fortress,

7
00:00:28,483 --> 00:00:30,483
built by the Empire
and since usurped

8
00:00:30,567 --> 00:00:32,025
by the Alliance.

9
00:00:32,108 --> 00:00:34,733
It possesses a prime location
squarely on the two nation's

10
00:00:34,817 --> 00:00:37,567
borders and a military
spaceport accommodating

11
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:39,567
up to 20,000 ships.

12
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:42,567
There's no question why they
fought for control over it.

13
00:00:46,025 --> 00:00:48,942
I hope you were able to
recharge a bit on the frontier.

14
00:00:49,025 --> 00:00:50,900
We've got a lot of work to do.

15
00:00:50,983 --> 00:00:52,400
[ALEX] I thought being
demoted would give me

16
00:00:52,483 --> 00:00:54,358
some time to unwind.

17
00:00:54,442 --> 00:00:56,567
I didn't expect to be
called back so soon.

18
00:00:58,858 --> 00:01:02,442
This place has got one heck of
a whip-cracking commander, huh?

19
00:01:02,525 --> 00:01:05,442
--[BOTH chuckle]
--[comm beeps]

20
00:01:05,525 --> 00:01:06,650
[YANG]
Talk to me.

21
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:07,983
[FREDERICA]
We received an urgent message

22
00:01:08,067 --> 00:01:09,442
from patrol ship Ulysses.

23
00:01:09,525 --> 00:01:11,567
They've encountered
an enemy warship.

24
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:14,108
It's apparently
carrying a special envoy.

25
00:01:14,192 --> 00:01:16,942
They'd like to
establish contact with us.

26
00:01:17,025 --> 00:01:18,567
[YANG]
Well, that was fast.

27
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:19,942
[gasps]

28
00:03:04,025 --> 00:03:05,317
[YANG]
As you all know,

29
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,317
we've just received
a rather interesting proposal

30
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,233
from our adversaries.

31
00:03:09,317 --> 00:03:12,483
Between our navy claiming
this fortress from the Empire,

32
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:15,483
and the fleets we lost to
the Imperials at Amritsar,

33
00:03:15,567 --> 00:03:19,817
many prisoners have been
claimed on both sides.

34
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:23,275
They have requested to arrange
a peaceful exchange for them.

35
00:03:23,358 --> 00:03:25,192
It's being framed
as an act of amnesty

36
00:03:25,275 --> 00:03:27,233
in honor of their
deceased emperor.

37
00:03:27,317 --> 00:03:29,733
However, feeding two million
starving captives

38
00:03:29,817 --> 00:03:31,775
starts to add up.

39
00:03:31,858 --> 00:03:33,275
[YANG]
Hmph.

40
00:03:33,358 --> 00:03:35,525
Though I imagine
that's only part of it.

41
00:03:35,608 --> 00:03:37,192
[gasping]

42
00:03:37,275 --> 00:03:38,983
I suspect that
they're facing a situation

43
00:03:39,067 --> 00:03:42,317
far more daunting then keeping
their enemy's bellies full.

44
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,025
Okay, and what is that?

45
00:03:45,108 --> 00:03:48,317
Likely, civil discontent
between the Lohengramm camp

46
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,275
and the opposing nobility.

47
00:03:50,358 --> 00:03:52,525
With his rise to Marquis,
he's making preparations for

48
00:03:52,608 --> 00:03:54,108
armed conflict with
the other faction

49
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:56,067
who vied for the throne.

50
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:58,108
That's my assumption.

51
00:03:58,192 --> 00:04:00,858
Negotiating with us over
prisoners of war would only

52
00:04:00,942 --> 00:04:03,233
be part of whatever
he's plotting.

53
00:04:03,317 --> 00:04:05,900
The return of Imperial
soldiers would inspire throngs

54
00:04:05,983 --> 00:04:08,858
of new followers
for their great savior.

55
00:04:08,942 --> 00:04:11,733
What a thorough plan indeed.

56
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,525
Well... In any case,

57
00:04:14,608 --> 00:04:16,983
our options are looking
limited at the moment.

58
00:04:17,067 --> 00:04:21,150
But getting our comrades back
safely is never a bad thing.

59
00:04:21,233 --> 00:04:23,358
Let's all do our
best to bring them home.

60
00:04:23,442 --> 00:04:24,775
[GROUP]
Yes, sir.

61
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:31,275
[NARRATOR]
The Alliance government

62
00:04:31,358 --> 00:04:33,775
accepted the arrangement.

63
00:04:33,858 --> 00:04:36,275
A convoy of transport
ships soon arrived

64
00:04:36,358 --> 00:04:40,108
carrying two million
Alliance soldiers in tow.

65
00:04:40,192 --> 00:04:44,108
The fleet approached Iserlohn
Fortress from rival territory.

66
00:04:44,192 --> 00:04:47,567
Led by the Imperial Navy
flagship Barbarossa.

67
00:04:58,942 --> 00:05:01,108
[GIRL 15A] The guy in
the middle is so handsome!

68
00:05:01,192 --> 00:05:03,233
[GIRL 15B]
Yeah!

69
00:05:03,317 --> 00:05:06,275
[POPLIN] Seriously?
That's what they're in to?

70
00:05:06,358 --> 00:05:08,192
Gotta say, he looks
like the real deal.

71
00:05:08,275 --> 00:05:11,692
Oh, yeah? All I'm seeing is
some dude up his own ass.

72
00:05:11,775 --> 00:05:13,025
Calm down there, buddy--

73
00:05:13,108 --> 00:05:15,275
your eyes are literally
green with envy right now.

74
00:05:15,358 --> 00:05:17,192
What was that?!

75
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:18,192
[ATTENBOROUGH]
You can tell he's here

76
00:05:18,275 --> 00:05:20,025
on Marquis Lohengramm's behalf.

77
00:05:20,108 --> 00:05:22,233
They've got that
same regal swagger.

78
00:05:22,317 --> 00:05:23,733
Imagine being
the Vice Commander

79
00:05:23,817 --> 00:05:26,858
of a whole armada
at such a young age.

80
00:05:26,942 --> 00:05:28,067
It's time.

81
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:29,900
We should head down
to the ceremonial hall.

82
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,525
[YANG]
Ah. Of course.

Sir?

85
00:05:39,442 --> 00:05:41,275
I've heard reports
that Admiral Kircheis

86
00:05:41,358 --> 00:05:43,317
is a man of his word.

87
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,733
This might be a good chance
to get a lesson in etiquette.

88
00:05:46,817 --> 00:05:49,567
I'd like you to attend
the proceedings with us.

[gasps]

Yes. It'd be an honor!

High Admiral of the
Galactic Imperial Navy.

94
00:06:22,775 --> 00:06:24,650
I'm Admiral Yang Wen-Li.

Of the Free Planets Alliance.

We're very grateful
for your proposal.

Likewise, sir,
and we are grateful

98
00:06:32,275 --> 00:06:34,192
for your acceptance of it.

99
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:44,067
[NARRATOR] Thus began
the exchange of prisoners.

100
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:47,233
The affair was carried out
with such an air of dignity

101
00:06:47,317 --> 00:06:48,900
that it was hard to
believe the two nations

102
00:06:48,983 --> 00:06:50,650
were currently at war.

103
00:06:50,733 --> 00:06:53,942
Just as they had been
for one 150 years.

00:07:00,483 --> 00:07:04,358
[applause]

105
00:07:04,442 --> 00:07:07,567
I suppose there's a reason
for all this formality.

106
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:11,233
But it seems rather
ridiculous. Doesn't it?

107
00:07:11,317 --> 00:07:13,192
Definitely.

108
00:07:13,275 --> 00:07:15,442
[KIRCHEIS] I feel fortunate,
both to have this sort

109
00:07:15,525 --> 00:07:18,442
of opportunity,
and such a pleasant meeting.

110
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:23,483
Civil discussion
over human life.

111
00:07:23,567 --> 00:07:27,525
It's the kind of trade
I'd welcome any day.

112
00:07:27,608 --> 00:07:29,275
I agree.

I'm turning 15 this year.

Is that so?

I was also 15 when
serving my first tour.

119
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:02,150
I may be in no position
to wish you good luck, but...

He does seem
like an upstanding

00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:17,275
sort of guy, doesn't he?

125
00:08:17,358 --> 00:08:19,275
Still can't hold
a candle to me, though.

126
00:08:19,358 --> 00:08:20,817
Huh?

127
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:23,275
You're not gonna go and defect
to the Empire on us, are ya?

00:08:23,358 --> 00:08:24,442
Huh?!

He was quite the gentleman.

00:08:40,858 --> 00:08:43,358
Uh-huh. Though it's
funny how my impression

134
00:08:43,442 --> 00:08:45,400
of an enemy commander
is better than my opinion

135
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:48,108
of one our own
nation's politicians.

136
00:08:50,442 --> 00:08:54,358
Marquis Reinhard von Lohengramm.

137
00:08:54,442 --> 00:08:56,650
I hope that we meet someday.

138
00:09:06,442 --> 00:09:08,692
Exemplary work.

139
00:09:08,775 --> 00:09:13,067
So? I'm curious, what sort of
man do you take him for?

140
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:17,192
[KIRCHEIS] Well. He seemed
a far cry from his reputation.

141
00:09:17,275 --> 00:09:20,025
At first glance, anyway.

142
00:09:20,108 --> 00:09:23,192
His very countenance
is immeasurably cautious.

143
00:09:23,275 --> 00:09:27,150
Yet it gave no clues as to
where his true intentions lie.

144
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:31,733
He's intimidating.
That was my impression.

145
00:09:31,817 --> 00:09:34,067
Oh?

146
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:36,692
At the risk of
overestimating his depth.

147
00:09:36,775 --> 00:09:40,567
It's possible he's already
seen through our operation.

Never forget.

You are all soldiers
with a united goal.

To defend our republic
and our freedom.

153

Idleness is
unacceptable if we want

to defeat the
treacherous Empire.

We need all of you to step up.

A joyful era with
our fellow countrymen.

Never forget that
steadfast mission!

00:10:23,567 --> 00:10:27,192
[CROWD cheers]

163
00:10:27,275 --> 00:10:28,775
[chanting]
Deat to the empire!

164
00:10:31,608 --> 00:10:32,817
[GREENHILL]
Admiral Yang.

165
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:35,733
Is my daughter
aptly fulfilling all

166
00:10:35,817 --> 00:10:37,692
of her professional duties?

167
00:10:39,692 --> 00:10:41,275
Yes, of course.

168
00:10:41,358 --> 00:10:43,900
She's been nothing short
of a tremendous help, Sir.

169
00:10:46,608 --> 00:10:49,150
If you've got a moment,
would you care to join us?

170
00:10:49,233 --> 00:10:51,817
[YANG] Actually, I have
some business to attend to.

171
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,525
You'll have to forgive me.

172
00:10:53,608 --> 00:10:55,233
But don't stop on my account--

173
00:10:55,317 --> 00:10:57,483
please, enjoy your
father-daughter time.

174
00:10:57,567 --> 00:11:00,025
[GREENHILL]
I see. That's too bad.

175
00:11:00,108 --> 00:11:01,233
[YANG]
Have fun.

176
00:11:03,817 --> 00:11:06,025
[FREDERICA]
Thank you. Please take care.

177
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:13,733
[YANG sighs]

178
00:11:13,817 --> 00:11:15,692
You sound pretty exhausted.

179
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:17,775
Yeah. If I had to endure

180
00:11:17,858 --> 00:11:20,817
another moment of
Trunicht blathering on,

181
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,983
I suppose it would've burned
through a whole lifetime's

182
00:11:23,067 --> 00:11:24,858
worth of my patience.

183
00:11:24,942 --> 00:11:27,775
[CULTISTS chanting]

184
00:11:27,858 --> 00:11:29,442
Terra is my mother!

185
00:11:29,525 --> 00:11:31,233
[YANG]
What's that all about?

186
00:11:31,317 --> 00:11:32,900
[JULIAN] It looks like
a gathering of people

187
00:11:32,983 --> 00:11:34,400
from the Church of Terra.

188
00:11:34,483 --> 00:11:35,692
Church of Terra?

189
00:11:35,775 --> 00:11:37,275
Yes.

190
00:11:37,358 --> 00:11:41,275
I saw them congregating earlier
by the ceremonial hall, too.

191
00:11:41,358 --> 00:11:44,775
They believe that Earth
is humanity's true homeland.

192
00:11:44,858 --> 00:11:47,150
They call for a holy
crusade to emancipate it

193
00:11:47,233 --> 00:11:49,400
from the Galactic Empire.

194
00:11:49,483 --> 00:11:51,858
Their credo says something
about building a cathedral

195
00:11:51,942 --> 00:11:54,108
to guide all of our souls.

196
00:11:54,192 --> 00:11:58,025
[YANG sighs]
Imagine that, huh.

197
00:11:58,108 --> 00:12:00,233
Earth hasn't been
the center of human society

198
00:12:00,317 --> 00:12:02,608
for something like
eight centuries now.

199
00:12:02,692 --> 00:12:04,567
[chanting continues]
Terra is my mother!

200
00:12:15,692 --> 00:12:18,067
Who would ever
imagine this situation?

201
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:20,400
An esteemed admiral of the
Alliance casually munching

202
00:12:20,483 --> 00:12:22,233
on street food in a park.

203
00:12:22,317 --> 00:12:24,900
It's a familiar
comfort food to me.

204
00:12:24,983 --> 00:12:27,233
This was the best stuff to
eat when we were breaking

205
00:12:27,317 --> 00:12:29,400
curfew back in cadet school.

206
00:12:29,483 --> 00:12:32,358
[laughter]

207
00:12:32,442 --> 00:12:34,608
[JULIAN] It's weird,
imagining how you lived

208
00:12:34,692 --> 00:12:36,400
during your school days.

209
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:54,108
Yet another thing
I'll never get back.

210
00:12:54,192 --> 00:12:55,817
Ah, nostalgia.

211
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,358
[footsteps]

212
00:13:01,942 --> 00:13:03,192
[YANG]
At ease.

213
00:13:03,275 --> 00:13:04,817
This is Admiral Bewcock.

214
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,567
[gasps]

215
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:08,442
Did I keep you waiting?

216
00:13:08,525 --> 00:13:10,233
Not much.

217
00:13:10,317 --> 00:13:13,775
Julian. Would you mind
keeping an eye out for me?

218
00:13:13,858 --> 00:13:15,150
On it!

219
00:13:20,858 --> 00:13:24,025
All right. Now let's hear
what you have to tell me.

220
00:13:24,108 --> 00:13:27,317
Well. Someday soon,

221
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:30,858
it's possible that a coup d'état
will occur in this country.

222
00:13:30,942 --> 00:13:34,317
[BEWCOCK]
Hmm. Like a revolution?

223
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,608
That's right.

224
00:13:36,692 --> 00:13:38,775
You see, I believe Lohengramm

225
00:13:38,858 --> 00:13:41,525
had ulterior motives
behind his proposal.

226
00:13:41,608 --> 00:13:43,442
The exchange of prisoners
was insurance for

227
00:13:43,525 --> 00:13:47,733
the upcoming battle for
supremacy against the nobility.

228
00:13:47,817 --> 00:13:50,983
But once the Empire
enters a state of civil war,

229
00:13:51,067 --> 00:13:53,317
they would want to take
strategic measures in order

230
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:56,942
to avoid allowing any
openings for our navy to attack.

231
00:13:57,025 --> 00:13:58,817
At that point though,
they won't have

232
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:01,150
any of their precious
military strength remaining

233
00:14:01,233 --> 00:14:03,525
to keep us in check.

234
00:14:03,608 --> 00:14:07,192
Naturally, they would
need some sort of strategy.

235
00:14:07,275 --> 00:14:10,817
[BEWCOCK] I see. And that's
where the coup comes in.

236
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:13,442
The Empire will pull the strings
of discontent to start

237
00:14:13,525 --> 00:14:16,317
an uprising within the Alliance.

238
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,567
What's more,
they'll most likely inspire

239
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:21,733
simultaneous rebellions
out on the frontier.

240
00:14:21,817 --> 00:14:24,275
And while our forces
are deployed to suppress them,

241
00:14:24,358 --> 00:14:26,192
our adversaries will
have the perfect chance

242
00:14:26,275 --> 00:14:28,317
to seize the capital.

243
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,942
That's quite
a troubling scenario

244
00:14:30,025 --> 00:14:31,192
you've thought up there.

245
00:14:31,275 --> 00:14:32,567
But could it be
possible for such

246
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:35,192
a theoretical plan to succeed?

247
00:14:35,275 --> 00:14:37,275
Doesn't matter if it succeeds.

248
00:14:37,358 --> 00:14:40,692
Not as far as Lohengramm
is concerned, anyway.

249
00:14:40,775 --> 00:14:42,858
He only needs to keep
the opposition divided

250
00:14:42,942 --> 00:14:44,900
while he's off conquering
his own nation.

251
00:14:46,275 --> 00:14:48,025
[BEWCOCK] But how does he
expect to accomplish that

252
00:14:48,108 --> 00:14:51,233
within the Alliance itself?

253
00:14:51,317 --> 00:14:53,983
Of course!
The prisoner exchange!

254
00:14:54,067 --> 00:14:57,192
Sir. Mixing secret operatives in

255
00:14:57,275 --> 00:15:00,650
among the returning soldiers
would be the simplest solution.

256
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,900
[BEWCOCK]
Two million potential suspects.

257
00:15:02,983 --> 00:15:05,025
Too many to probe.

258
00:15:05,108 --> 00:15:07,108
It'll be extremely
difficult to determine

259
00:15:07,192 --> 00:15:09,733
much of anything
before it might happen.

260
00:15:09,817 --> 00:15:10,900
[sighs]

261
00:15:10,983 --> 00:15:12,483
That's a lot of hassle
he's going through

262
00:15:12,567 --> 00:15:13,983
to cause us a headache.

263
00:15:14,067 --> 00:15:16,358
That may be true, but if
everyone else does the work,

264
00:15:16,442 --> 00:15:19,858
he just has to sit back
and watch things unfold.

265
00:15:19,942 --> 00:15:21,400
[BEWCOCK sighs]

266
00:15:21,483 --> 00:15:23,650
So. I need to prevent a mutiny

267
00:15:23,733 --> 00:15:25,692
without knowing
who's going to cause it,

268
00:15:25,775 --> 00:15:28,608
or when the incident
may potentially occur.

269
00:15:28,692 --> 00:15:31,025
You do know that's
a big request.

270
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:34,900
Also. I need one more favor.

271
00:15:34,983 --> 00:15:36,858
[BEWCOCK]
Don't tell me there's more?!

272
00:15:36,942 --> 00:15:38,275
[YANG]
I'm sorry, sir.

273
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:44,817
[JULIAN] I wonder what the
admirals are talking about.

274
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:47,358
Will the day ever come
when I get to know?

275
00:15:52,317 --> 00:15:54,358
[BEWCOCK] I'll make sure that
what you requested is delivered

276
00:15:54,442 --> 00:15:57,400
promptly to you before
you depart Heinessen.

277
00:15:57,483 --> 00:16:00,108
I appreciate it, sir.

278
00:16:00,192 --> 00:16:03,150
[BEWCOCK] I'd like you to
answer one last thing for me.

279
00:16:04,192 --> 00:16:05,900
You've somehow
predicted the strategy

280
00:16:05,983 --> 00:16:08,233
that the Marquis may employ.

281
00:16:08,317 --> 00:16:11,567
Could it be that you've already
thought of such a plan yourself?

282
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:14,733
A similar approach to
implement against the Empire?

283
00:16:16,858 --> 00:16:18,692
If I'm being truly honest,

284
00:16:18,775 --> 00:16:22,567
temptation has
presented itself. But no.

285
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:25,067
I am but a single soldier.

286
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:28,275
Whatever's possible for me to
accomplish within that position,

287
00:16:28,358 --> 00:16:30,442
that's all I can
hope to achieve.

288
00:16:31,983 --> 00:16:35,608
I see. Very well.

289
00:16:35,692 --> 00:16:37,067
Good evening.

290
00:16:38,567 --> 00:16:40,192
[YANG]
Take care of yourself.

291
00:16:44,108 --> 00:16:45,442
[sighs]

292
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:53,525
[GREENHILL] We will begin
our operations on Neptis.

293
00:16:53,608 --> 00:16:55,733
Starting sequential
military uprisings

294
00:16:55,817 --> 00:16:58,442
on these four frontier planets.

295
00:16:58,525 --> 00:17:00,067
This will leave
the capital of Heinessen

296
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:02,108
without any of its defenses.

297
00:17:02,192 --> 00:17:05,442
Our best soldiers will then take
control of all vital points.

298
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:08,067
And the political
center will be ours.

299
00:17:09,608 --> 00:17:12,442
[GREENHILL] Now then,
there is one potential threat

300
00:17:12,525 --> 00:17:16,275
standing in our way:
Admiral Yang Wen-Li,

301
00:17:16,358 --> 00:17:18,817
the commander of
Iserlohn Fortress.

302
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:21,108
We've yet to secure
him as an ally.

303
00:17:21,192 --> 00:17:24,108
I'd like to hear any opinions.

304
00:17:24,192 --> 00:17:26,358
His popularity and
tactical intelligence

305
00:17:26,442 --> 00:17:28,108
would certainly prove useful.

306
00:17:28,192 --> 00:17:31,817
We shouldn't underestimate
Iserlohn's military potential.

307
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:34,358
If we can ensure
the admiral's loyalty,

308
00:17:34,442 --> 00:17:36,733
we'll be able to occupy
the entire territory

309
00:17:36,817 --> 00:17:38,692
from the capital
to the fortress.

310
00:17:38,775 --> 00:17:40,150
There isn't much time.

311
00:17:40,233 --> 00:17:42,692
Do you think he could
still be persuaded?

312
00:17:42,775 --> 00:17:45,150
[FALK]
Who needs that man?

313
00:17:45,233 --> 00:17:48,692
I feel he's quite
unnecessary to our cause.

314
00:17:48,775 --> 00:17:51,067
Personal emotions
have no place here.

315
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:52,775
Though our time is running
short, there's only--

316
00:17:52,858 --> 00:17:54,108
[GATTY]
But, sir.

317
00:17:54,192 --> 00:17:55,817
We can't ignore the fact
that Yang's Fleet

318
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:58,983
could pose a serious threat.

319
00:17:59,067 --> 00:18:00,567
Based on our
advantage in distance,

320
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:02,775
I believe we're safe
to move forward.

321
00:18:02,858 --> 00:18:04,317
Regarding Iserlohn?

322
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,817
We can deal with them
and their commander

323
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,733
once we have the capital.

324
00:18:07,817 --> 00:18:09,775
Fortunately for us,
Artemis's Necklace

325
00:18:09,858 --> 00:18:12,067
and its defensive satellites
are stationed throughout

326
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:14,858
the planet's orbit
for protection.

327
00:18:14,942 --> 00:18:17,942
Even Miracle Yang won't be able
to break through easily.

328
00:18:18,025 --> 00:18:20,983
Not with such a system
of fortification in place.

329
00:18:21,067 --> 00:18:24,733
That alone will provide us
with room for negotiation.

330
00:18:24,817 --> 00:18:27,192
Well then, as a
preventative measure,

331
00:18:27,275 --> 00:18:30,817
I suggest that we send some of
our men out on reconnaissance.

332
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,608
If the admiral dare
to attempt anything

333
00:18:32,692 --> 00:18:34,775
that would put us
at a disadvantage,

334
00:18:34,858 --> 00:18:38,525
having eyes on him would
allow for easy elimination.

335
00:18:38,608 --> 00:18:40,775
[BRONZE] Taking the proper

[RADICAL 15C]
We risk more if we don't.

339
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:45,983
[RADICAL 15B]
I suppose that's true.

340
00:18:46,067 --> 00:18:48,150
--[RADICALS murmuring]
--[FALK chuckles]

341
00:18:49,942 --> 00:18:51,025
Very well.

342
00:18:51,108 --> 00:18:53,483
Let's move forward
with that suggestion.

343
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:56,567
We'll decide who
to send immediately.

344
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:58,400
But first, gentlemen,
I'd like to emphasize

345
00:18:58,483 --> 00:19:01,483
the following statements.

346
00:19:01,567 --> 00:19:03,067
Never forget our mission.

347
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:04,525
We must stand strong.

348
00:19:04,608 --> 00:19:07,067
Our goal is to purge this
infected political system

349
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:11,108
of corruption and return
to our long-lost ideals.

350
00:19:11,192 --> 00:19:13,233
We will restore
the freedom and democracy

351
00:19:13,317 --> 00:19:17,233
this great nation once had.
Give rise to a new government.

352
00:19:17,317 --> 00:19:19,692
This is what
drives us to action.

353
00:19:21,067 --> 00:19:24,775
Take heed. A battle
for justice cannot be avoided.

354
00:19:24,858 --> 00:19:27,275
Not if we wish to
rebuild our homeland.

355
00:19:27,358 --> 00:19:28,775
[RADICALS]
Long live the Alliance!

[GREENHILL]
Moving on,

358
00:19:32,942 --> 00:19:34,650
there's the matter of
the reconnaissance agent.

359
00:19:34,733 --> 00:19:36,817
Does anyone have
any nominations...

360
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,150
[LYNCH]
"Purge"? "Rebuild"?

361
00:19:39,233 --> 00:19:41,775
"Battle for justice"?

362
00:19:41,858 --> 00:19:44,025
What a bunch of fools.

363
00:19:44,108 --> 00:19:48,067
None of you have
any idea what's coming.

364
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:50,192
Not a clue.

Alliance Navy Rear Admiral.

Arthur Lynch.

367
00:20:02,317 --> 00:20:05,192
It's been about nine years
since we've taken you prisoner.

368
00:20:05,275 --> 00:20:06,817
It says that you're
currently undergoing

369
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,900
corrective internment.

370
00:20:08,983 --> 00:20:12,817
Your behavior and attitude
are listed as extremely poor.

371
00:20:14,608 --> 00:20:17,608
So this is what has become of
the coward of El Facil.

Commander-in-Chief,

00:20:39,817 --> 00:20:43,567
Hey. So you're
the big boss-man, huh?

379
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:45,942
Forget it.
You're much too young.

380
00:20:46,025 --> 00:20:48,733
I mean, you're
practically still a baby!

381
00:20:48,817 --> 00:20:50,233
About nine years ago,

382
00:20:50,317 --> 00:20:53,942
just before the fall of
the planet El Facil, you fled.

383
00:20:54,025 --> 00:20:55,817
Shamelessly abandoning
all the people

384
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,400
you were sworn to protect.

385
00:20:57,483 --> 00:21:00,067
You tried to escape but
ended up in our hands.

386
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:02,108
I'm telling you, I didn't run!

387
00:21:02,192 --> 00:21:05,692
I only went off to
request reinforcements.

388
00:21:05,775 --> 00:21:06,942
I swear.

389
00:21:07,025 --> 00:21:09,775
But then that damn
Yang Wen-Li got involved.

390
00:21:09,858 --> 00:21:12,858
If that sad excuse worked
in your favor even once,

391
00:21:12,942 --> 00:21:16,067
surely, your former men wouldn't
have shown you such contempt

under internment.

Could a man like this
really be useful to us?

I can make him
useful to us, Kircheis.

397
00:21:34,317 --> 00:21:36,858
Otherwise,
his life is worthless.

And he deserves death.
