The insurgents who threatened
the Free Planets Alliance

00:00:19,108 --> 00:00:21,733
have now been
brought to justice.

However, it is not the
time to rest and mourn.

00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:31,025
Our holy war to defeat the
Empire still continues on.

00:00:31,108 --> 00:00:33,650
We are only here
thanks to our brave men.

The heroes who laid down their
lives to defend the Alliance.

9
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,858
Now we must follow
in their footsteps.

10
00:00:40,942 --> 00:00:44,150
To insure even greater
freedom and prosperity

11
00:00:44,233 --> 00:00:46,067
to the Alliance of the future.

12
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:49,442
Let us pledge our
faith and our hearts!

13
00:00:49,525 --> 00:00:52,025
For that, and only that,
is the greatest honor that we,

our fallen heroes and friends!

[YANG] I'd like to hear
one good reason why

17
00:02:43,483 --> 00:02:45,733
I have to shake Trunicht's hand.

18
00:02:45,817 --> 00:02:47,983
I don't want to
touch that bastard.

19
00:02:48,067 --> 00:02:50,192
[JULIAN] Because it comes
with your position.

20
00:02:50,275 --> 00:02:51,692
Just bear with it.

21
00:02:51,775 --> 00:02:53,900
[YANG sighs]
If I knew I'd have to do this,

22
00:02:53,983 --> 00:02:56,900
I might've reconsidered
winning that battle.

23
00:02:56,983 --> 00:03:00,983
They're gonna expect me to do
stuff like this more often.

24
00:03:01,067 --> 00:03:02,192
That may be true,

25
00:03:02,275 --> 00:03:04,858
but you'd never seriously
lose on purpose.

[YANG]
Oh, yes, I would.

27
00:03:06,858 --> 00:03:11,317
I'll get my ass kicked, then my
reputation will take a nosedive,

28
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,483
and no one will stop me
from leaving this job.

29
00:03:14,567 --> 00:03:17,567
I'll be free from
the hell of these ceremonies,

30
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:19,192
and finally get to retire.

31

You really mean that?

32
00:03:21,775 --> 00:03:23,483
I sure do.

33
00:03:23,567 --> 00:03:27,942
I'll retire and live quietly in
a little house in the country.

While on rainy nights,
I'll spare a thought for

Allow me to
thank you for your service.

From the vantage
point of the stage,

79
00:06:00,025 --> 00:06:03,400
seeing how many people
showed up got me thinking.

80
00:06:03,483 --> 00:06:05,650
What am I supposed
to do about a democracy

81
00:06:05,733 --> 00:06:07,983
that gives a man like
Trunicht legal authority

82
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:10,108
and the right to rule?

83
00:06:10,192 --> 00:06:11,525
And what am I
supposed to make of

84
00:06:11,608 --> 00:06:14,275
the people who keep
supporting him?

85
00:06:14,358 --> 00:06:16,317
Were you able to find an answer?

86
00:06:18,983 --> 00:06:23,317
To be honest, what came
to mind was sort of terrifying.

87
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,983
I would bet that
Rudolf von Goldenbaum,

88
00:06:26,067 --> 00:06:29,358
and much more recently, the
group behind the coup d'état,

89
00:06:29,442 --> 00:06:31,192
thought the same thing.

90
00:06:31,275 --> 00:06:36,025
"Only I can stop this, only I
know how to save the people."

91
00:06:36,108 --> 00:06:38,692
Frankly, it's paradoxical.

92
00:06:38,775 --> 00:06:41,775
But what turned Rudolf in
to a cruel dictator was his

93
00:06:41,858 --> 00:06:45,400
sense of duty and responsibility
towards all of humanity.

94
00:06:49,233 --> 00:06:50,942
Well then, what about Trunicht?

95
00:06:51,025 --> 00:06:54,858
Do you think he feels that same
duty and responsibility?

96
00:06:54,942 --> 00:06:57,067
Not sure I could say.

97
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:59,983
It doesn't seem like it, though.

98
00:07:00,067 --> 00:07:01,942
Anyway, I'm tired.

99
00:07:02,025 --> 00:07:04,900
That's enough thinking about him
for a day, wouldn't you agree?

100
00:07:04,983 --> 00:07:06,358
Yeah, I guess so.

101

Why don't you go
to bed early tonight?

Okay, but...

You've heard of Admiral
Merkatz, haven't you?

That Imperial Navy admiral?

124
00:08:01,192 --> 00:08:04,358
He's not as grand or glamorous
as Marquis Lohengramm,

125
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:06,983
but he is quite experienced.

126
00:08:07,067 --> 00:08:09,692
Plus, I hear
he's pretty popular, too.

127
00:08:09,775 --> 00:08:11,358
So, what about him?

00:08:11,442 --> 00:08:13,650
Well, that popular
Imperial Navy admiral

129
00:08:13,733 --> 00:08:15,442
has just defected!

130
00:08:15,525 --> 00:08:18,067
And he's requested
your help specifically!

131
00:08:19,358 --> 00:08:20,442
What did you say?

132
00:08:27,817 --> 00:08:29,025
[ALEX]
Now, to begin with,

133
00:08:29,108 --> 00:08:31,400
we'll need you all to leave
your weapons here.

134
00:08:31,483 --> 00:08:33,400
What? How disrespectful!

135
00:08:33,483 --> 00:08:35,983
Admiral Merkatz
isn't a war prisoner.

136
00:08:36,067 --> 00:08:39,275
He has chosen to defect here
of his own free will!

137
00:08:39,358 --> 00:08:43,025
And despite that fact,
you demand he be disarmed?

138
00:08:43,108 --> 00:08:44,733
Is it not proper
etiquette to treat him

139
00:08:44,817 --> 00:08:47,192
as if he were simply
a guest of yours?

140
00:08:47,275 --> 00:08:49,858
Or does nothing even
resembling etiquette exist here

141
00:08:49,942 --> 00:08:51,942
in the Free Planets Alliance?

142
00:08:54,025 --> 00:08:55,608
Yes, my apologies.

143
00:08:55,692 --> 00:08:57,983
I hope you can
forgive my rudeness.

144
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:02,692
[MURAI]
I hear that after all that,

145
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:05,650
they've been treating him
like a guest of honor.

146
00:09:05,733 --> 00:09:07,525
Honestly, I find his
story somewhat hard

147
00:09:07,608 --> 00:09:09,567
to believe, myself.

148
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:11,775
Do we know whether
or not Admiral Merkatz

149
00:09:11,858 --> 00:09:13,483
brought his family with him?

150
00:09:13,567 --> 00:09:17,400
We do. His whole family
stayed behind in the Empire.

151
00:09:17,483 --> 00:09:19,983
I see. That's good.

152
00:09:20,067 --> 00:09:22,067
[MURAI]
No, it's not.

153
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:25,233
The fact that his family remains
in the Empire essentially means

154
00:09:25,317 --> 00:09:28,067
that he's left potential
hostages behind.

155
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:30,233
Considering that, it's not
unreasonable to believe

156
00:09:30,317 --> 00:09:33,483
he came here with some
unsavory goal in mind.

157
00:09:33,567 --> 00:09:35,733
I think it's a bit unreasonable.

158
00:09:35,817 --> 00:09:38,650
If he was planning to deceive
me, he wouldn't have admitted

159
00:09:38,733 --> 00:09:40,733
to leaving his family behind.

160
00:09:40,817 --> 00:09:42,567
It's much more likely
he'd have brought along

161
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:46,317
a fake family who could
act as observers, instead.

162
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,983
Am I on the right
track Commander Baghdash?

163
00:09:50,067 --> 00:09:52,483
Yeah, that sounds
like something they'd do.

164
00:09:52,567 --> 00:09:55,942
But not Admiral Merkatz, he's
too much of a true military man.

165
00:09:56,025 --> 00:09:57,775
I doubt he'd want anything
to do with such things

166
00:09:57,858 --> 00:09:59,983
as spying or sabotage.

167
00:10:00,067 --> 00:10:01,900
So I think he's reliable.

168
00:10:03,775 --> 00:10:06,942
Sounds like we'll trust him
a lot faster than we did you.

169
00:10:07,025 --> 00:10:09,150
Hey now, that was uncalled for.

170
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:11,442
Don'tcha think,
Commodore Schönkopf?

171
00:10:12,775 --> 00:10:14,358
Well, regardless.

172
00:10:14,442 --> 00:10:17,400
I'm choosing to trust
Admiral Merkatz, and his word.

173
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:20,775
Furthermore, I plan
to protect his rights to

174
00:10:20,858 --> 00:10:23,400
the best of my ability.

175
00:10:23,483 --> 00:10:25,275
A veteran admiral
of the Empire has

176
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:28,733
turned to me for help,
after all.

177
00:10:28,817 --> 00:10:31,692
I have to reciprocate his favor.

178
00:10:31,775 --> 00:10:34,442
You're absolutely
certain you want to do this?

179
00:10:34,525 --> 00:10:38,400
Yeah. You know me,
I'm weak to flattery.

180
00:10:38,483 --> 00:10:41,483
Lieutenant, put me through
to Iserlohn immediately.

181
00:10:41,567 --> 00:10:42,858
Yes, sir.

182
00:10:48,483 --> 00:10:51,108
[YANG]
You're Admiral Merkatz, correct?

183
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:52,692
That I am.

184
00:10:52,775 --> 00:10:54,650
Yang Wen-li.

185
00:10:54,733 --> 00:10:57,192
It's truly a pleasure to
make your acquaintance.

186
00:10:57,275 --> 00:10:58,858
Yes, likewise.

187
00:10:58,942 --> 00:11:01,900
This fallen admiral
is hereby in your service.

188
00:11:01,983 --> 00:11:04,900
I only ask that you show
leniency to my subordinates,

189
00:11:04,983 --> 00:11:06,692
who may have acted brashly.

190
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:09,733
A considerate request.

191
00:11:09,817 --> 00:11:12,150
Seems you have
some fine men under you.

192
00:11:12,233 --> 00:11:13,817
If they're worth sticking
out your neck,

193
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,858
then I'm happy to accept them.

194
00:11:15,942 --> 00:11:17,317
You don't need to worry.

195
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,650
I thank you for your kindness.

196
00:11:19,733 --> 00:11:21,483
[YANG]
Well, that'll be all.

197
00:11:21,567 --> 00:11:22,775
Yes, sir.

198
00:11:26,692 --> 00:11:30,483
Well, it turns out you
gave me some sound advice.

199
00:11:30,567 --> 00:11:33,525
Admiral Yang seems
to be a trustworthy man.

200
00:11:33,608 --> 00:11:34,900
Sir.

201
00:11:34,983 --> 00:11:36,942
[NARRATOR]
Yang kept his promise,

202
00:11:37,025 --> 00:11:38,817
and did all he could
to protect the rights

203
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:41,400
of Merkatz and his men.

204
00:11:41,483 --> 00:11:44,192
As a result
of this mutual trust,

205
00:11:44,275 --> 00:11:46,733
the Alliance government
gave Merkatz the status of

206
00:11:46,817 --> 00:11:50,317
"guest admiral," and appointed
him as an advisor to

207
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,525
the Iserlohn
Fortress commander.

208
00:11:54,817 --> 00:11:57,692
[DOUMEC] The matter of Admiral
Merkatz has been settled,

209
00:11:57,775 --> 00:12:00,067
but the problem is Yang Wen-li.

210
00:12:01,192 --> 00:12:02,692
[DOUMEC]
This was a civil war,

211
00:12:02,775 --> 00:12:05,775
so we can just give him a medal
and call that his recompense.

212
00:12:05,858 --> 00:12:07,900
But the next time he
does some heroic deed,

213
00:12:07,983 --> 00:12:10,233
we'll have no choice
but to promote him.

214
00:12:10,317 --> 00:12:13,192
Barely 30 and he
might become a fleet admiral?

215
00:12:13,275 --> 00:12:14,942
An undefeated hero.

216
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:17,567
Not to mention a young bachelor.

217
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:19,608
If he retired
and went into politics,

218
00:12:19,692 --> 00:12:21,650
he's almost guaranteed
to earn enough votes

219
00:12:21,733 --> 00:12:23,817
to win any election.

220
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,400
Just because he's a hero on

221
00:12:25,483 --> 00:12:27,650
the battlefield doesn't
mean he has the talent

222
00:12:27,733 --> 00:12:30,858
or know-how to
succeed in politics.

223
00:12:30,942 --> 00:12:32,942
Of course, but
that doesn't change the fact

224
00:12:33,025 --> 00:12:36,067
that many people would
be drawn to his reputation.

225
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:38,942
If that were to happen,
regardless of his capability,

226
00:12:39,025 --> 00:12:41,983
he would be a force
too potent to ignore.

227
00:12:42,067 --> 00:12:44,067
Before the Battle
of the Doria Starzone,

228
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:47,733
he made a speech to every
officer and soldier in his navy.

229
00:12:47,817 --> 00:12:50,108
He said that
the rise and fall of a nation

230
00:12:50,192 --> 00:12:54,150
was trivial in comparison to the
people's rights and freedoms.

231
00:12:54,233 --> 00:12:56,358
That's dangerous ideology.

232
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:58,025
He's basically
saying that as long

233
00:12:58,108 --> 00:13:00,483
as individual rights and
freedoms are protected,

234
00:13:00,567 --> 00:13:02,025
it wouldn't matter
if the Alliance

235
00:13:02,108 --> 00:13:05,067
was replaced by the Empire.

236
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:07,817
[IRONS sighs]
With speeches like that,

237
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:10,733
one can't help but be a bit
suspicious of his loyalty

238
00:13:10,817 --> 00:13:12,650
towards his nation.

239
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,733
[NEGROPONTE]
Thus far,

240
00:13:27,817 --> 00:13:30,858
Yang has made problematic
statements at every turn.

241
00:13:30,942 --> 00:13:33,942
If given the opportunity,
he'll make many more.

242
00:13:34,025 --> 00:13:36,192
Like it or not,
Admiral Yang's talents

243
00:13:36,275 --> 00:13:38,358
are a necessity to the Alliance.

244
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:41,317
So long as the Empire
is our enemy, that is.

245
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,150
Unless it's something
that could prove lethal,

246
00:13:43,233 --> 00:13:47,233
we may need to tolerate
some of the things he says.

247
00:13:47,317 --> 00:13:50,525
Still, there's no need
for us to start panicking.

248
00:13:50,608 --> 00:13:52,650
Let's just keep an eye
on how things progress

249
00:13:52,733 --> 00:13:54,317
for the time being.

250
00:13:55,525 --> 00:13:56,817
[KONEV]
So did you hear?

251
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:59,150
About Admiral Merkatz, I mean.

252
00:13:59,233 --> 00:14:01,775
[ATTENBOROUGH] Yeah. Admiral
Yang's really happy about it.

253
00:14:01,858 --> 00:14:04,317
They named him a
vice admiral for now...

254
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,983
...but he'll probably
be formally named

255
00:14:06,067 --> 00:14:07,650
an admiral eventually.

256
00:14:07,733 --> 00:14:10,400
Man, the Alliance's head
honchos sure are hospitable

257
00:14:10,483 --> 00:14:13,233
toward defectors,
don'tcha think?

258
00:14:13,317 --> 00:14:15,983
Meanwhile, after everything
his fleet's accomplished...

259
00:14:16,067 --> 00:14:18,733
...Yang is still stuck
at his current rank of Admiral.

260
00:14:18,817 --> 00:14:21,942
Leaving basically no chance for
his men to be promoted, either.

261
00:14:22,025 --> 00:14:24,358
Yeah, but Chief Dawson and
Commander-in-Chief Bewcock

262
00:14:24,442 --> 00:14:26,067
are both admirals, too.

263
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:28,192
Since Admiral Yang is
technically below them,

264
00:14:28,275 --> 00:14:30,483
he can't leapfrog
them to Fleet Admiral.

265
00:14:30,567 --> 00:14:32,067
I'm sure he's pissed
off that he can't get

266
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:33,858
the promotion he deserves.

267
00:14:33,942 --> 00:14:35,692
Please. He was never interested

268
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:37,650
in climbing
the ranks to begin with.

269
00:14:37,733 --> 00:14:38,858
Trust me.

270
00:14:38,942 --> 00:14:40,108
[WALTER]
Really?

271
00:14:40,192 --> 00:14:42,233
So you're a second class
petty officer now, huh?

272
00:14:42,317 --> 00:14:43,233
Nice.

273
00:14:43,317 --> 00:14:44,400
[YANG sighs]

274
00:14:44,483 --> 00:14:46,150
Congratulations on
your promotion as well,

275
00:14:46,233 --> 00:14:47,942
Rear Admiral Schönkopf.

276
00:14:48,025 --> 00:14:49,442
Thanks, kid.

277
00:14:49,525 --> 00:14:52,192
I was told it was mostly because
the people of Shampool

278
00:14:52,275 --> 00:14:55,192
had strongly requested it,
but there's a rumor going around

279
00:14:55,275 --> 00:14:57,358
that Admiral Dawson only
did it to put a crack

280
00:14:57,442 --> 00:14:59,733
in our fleet's unity.

281
00:14:59,817 --> 00:15:01,858
However, Chief Cubersly
has returned and taken his

282
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:05,317
position back from Dawson,
so it'll be fine.

283
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,900
You, too, huh?

284
00:15:06,983 --> 00:15:09,233
I heard a rumor that
my promotion only happened

285
00:15:09,317 --> 00:15:12,567
because of a direct intervention
by Chairman Trunicht.

286
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:15,608
So, it's not like
I can be too happy about it.

287
00:15:17,233 --> 00:15:19,275
Some advice, Julian.

288
00:15:19,358 --> 00:15:21,275
The military is overrun
with the agendas

289
00:15:21,358 --> 00:15:23,858
of all kinds of
different people.

290
00:15:23,942 --> 00:15:25,233
Inevitably,
those agendas will have

291
00:15:25,317 --> 00:15:26,858
a direct effect on us--

292
00:15:26,942 --> 00:15:29,150
sometimes they're good,
sometimes they're bad.

293
00:15:29,233 --> 00:15:32,317
But you can't let every little
thing like that get to you.

294
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,025
We just have to
focus on the positive

295
00:15:34,108 --> 00:15:37,900
that comes out of the situation.
You understand?

296
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:39,317
Yes, I understand.

297
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,233
I'll try to think
about it that way.

298
00:15:41,317 --> 00:15:43,108
[YANG]
Julian.

299
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:45,900
I still haven't recognized
you as a soldier, yet.

300
00:15:45,983 --> 00:15:48,025
You'd do well to remember that.

301
00:15:48,108 --> 00:15:49,483
Admiral.

302
00:15:49,567 --> 00:15:52,025
You do see what the kid is
holding in his hands, right?

303
00:15:53,733 --> 00:15:55,650
[WALTER] Don't you think
you're being a little unfair,

304
00:15:55,733 --> 00:15:57,233
to not acknowledge
a soldier who's been

305
00:15:57,317 --> 00:15:59,650
given so many medals?

306
00:15:59,733 --> 00:16:00,983
[YANG]
Listen.

307
00:16:01,067 --> 00:16:04,067
Just toss those in
your locker or wherever.

308
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:05,525
[JULIAN]
Y-Yes, sir...

309
00:16:05,608 --> 00:16:08,567
[YANG] You can use the box
as a soap dish or something.

310
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:10,733
I'm going down
to Heinessen for a bit.

311
00:16:10,817 --> 00:16:12,775
[WALTER]
Then I'll go too, as your guard.

312
00:16:12,858 --> 00:16:14,358
I'll come with you, as well.

313
00:16:14,442 --> 00:16:18,317
[YANG] No. I just want
to go by myself today.

314
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,567
Take care of the
place while I'm gone.

315
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:22,983
Okay, but be careful.

316
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:27,275
Wonder why he's going alone.

317
00:16:27,358 --> 00:16:29,067
Who knows?

318
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:55,983
[bells ringing]

319
00:16:56,067 --> 00:16:58,067
Well, we've
finally made it here.

320
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:02,358
Just like he said we would.
The old order is gone.

321
00:17:02,442 --> 00:17:06,233
And, today, a new one
will take its place.

322
00:17:06,317 --> 00:17:09,608
[MITTERMEYER] An era surely to
be welcomed by the people.

323
00:17:09,692 --> 00:17:12,733
Naturally. I welcome it, myself.

324
00:17:12,817 --> 00:17:16,525
It's exciting to be here for
the birth of this new age.

325
00:17:17,775 --> 00:17:20,025
Let's be on our way.

326
00:17:20,108 --> 00:17:21,317
[REUENTHAL]
Let's.

327
00:17:39,025 --> 00:17:43,108
[NARRATOR] In October
of the year IC 488,

328
00:17:43,192 --> 00:17:45,275
Reinhard von Lohengramm
was promoted

329
00:17:45,358 --> 00:17:48,233
to the position of duke.

330
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:50,608
In addition to the title
of Supreme Commander

331
00:17:50,692 --> 00:17:53,817
of the Imperial Navy,
he took the seat

332
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:56,608
of the Imperial
Prime Minister,

333
00:17:56,692 --> 00:18:02,650
giving him complete supremacy in
both the military and politics.

334
00:18:02,733 --> 00:18:07,900
And thus began the dictatorship
of Duke Lohengramm.

335
00:18:26,025 --> 00:18:27,317
[REINHARD]
This is far enough.

336
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,525
[OFFICER 24A]
Sir!

337
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:33,525
[NARRATOR] The late Siegfried
Kircheis was granted the title

338
00:19:33,608 --> 00:19:35,650
of Imperial Fleet Admiral.

339
00:19:35,733 --> 00:19:38,400
He also was
posthumously named:

340
00:19:38,483 --> 00:19:40,692
Minister of Military Affairs,

341
00:19:40,775 --> 00:19:43,233
Supreme Command
Headquarters Chief,

342
00:19:43,317 --> 00:19:45,358
Space Fleet Commander,

343
00:19:45,442 --> 00:19:48,650
Acting Supreme Commander
of the Imperial Navy,

344
00:19:48,733 --> 00:19:52,858
and finally, Acting
Imperial Prime Minister.

345
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:56,817
Still, no matter what
worldly glory he possessed,

346
00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:00,483
Reinhard could never repay his
red-haired friend's devotion.

347
00:20:00,567 --> 00:20:03,358
With this in mind,
the inscription Reinhard

348
00:20:03,442 --> 00:20:08,275
chose for Kircheis's gravestone
was simple and concise.

349
00:20:08,358 --> 00:20:10,442
Just two words:

350
00:20:10,525 --> 00:20:13,525
"My Friend," and nothing more.

351
00:20:33,942 --> 00:20:36,317
[NARRATOR]
The year UC 797,

352
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,192
or the 488th year of the
Imperial Calendar,

353
00:20:40,275 --> 00:20:44,317
was an unusual one for
the long-divided human society.

354
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,067
In that the two sides did not
meet each other in battle.

355
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:49,650
But whether or not the winners

356
00:20:49,733 --> 00:20:52,233
of the internal disputes that
occurred within each nation were

357
00:20:52,317 --> 00:20:56,942
satisfied with their victories
was another story.

358
00:20:57,025 --> 00:20:59,275
One of them made great strides

359
00:20:59,358 --> 00:21:03,067
but lost something
irreplaceable in the process.

360
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:07,317
The other gained new allies
but felt a looming danger

361
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,775
behind his back.

362
00:21:09,858 --> 00:21:12,733
In this year,
Reinhard von Lohengramm

363
00:21:12,817 --> 00:21:18,067
was 21 years old,
and Yang Wen-li was 30.

364
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:20,858
At this moment,
both were at an age where

365
00:21:20,942 --> 00:21:24,442
the future held more
for them than the past.

366
00:23:11,108 --> 00:23:13,942
[BISHOP] I must admit that
Rubinsky's performance

367
00:23:14,025 --> 00:23:17,233
in this battle was far
from satisfactory.

368
00:23:17,317 --> 00:23:20,067
That much, I believe
we can all agree on.

369
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:22,358
[DE VILLIE] But It's worse
than that, Your Lordship.

370
00:23:22,442 --> 00:23:26,067
In fact, I sense a lack
of enthusiasm in him.

371
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:27,525
Maybe he's abandoned our cause

372
00:23:27,608 --> 00:23:30,025
in favor of his own
self-interests.

373
00:23:30,108 --> 00:23:31,233
What then?

374
00:23:31,317 --> 00:23:33,275
If he keeps this up
for a few more years...

375
00:23:33,358 --> 00:23:36,817
[BISHOP]
Collect yourself and look.

376
00:23:39,983 --> 00:23:43,858
[BISHOP] Even now,
the sun rejoices in life.

377
00:23:43,942 --> 00:23:47,733
But what of its child,
our Earth?

378
00:23:47,817 --> 00:23:50,317
The trees have withered,
the soil has lost

379
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,067
its nutrients and the
birds and the fish have

380
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:55,983
vanished from both sky and sea.

381
00:23:56,067 --> 00:23:58,900
Humanity has abandoned
its mother planet

382
00:23:58,983 --> 00:24:01,942
to race among
the stars, like fools.

383
00:24:02,025 --> 00:24:04,775
Content with battling
itself to death.

384
00:24:04,858 --> 00:24:08,025
But understand,
this will not last much longer.

385
00:24:08,108 --> 00:24:11,025
The homeland of mankind
will return, and history

386
00:24:11,108 --> 00:24:15,608
will begin anew, here,
on our planet of Terra.

387
00:24:15,692 --> 00:24:18,858
We have already
waited for eight centuries.

388
00:24:18,942 --> 00:24:23,067
What is another two or three
years when compared to that?

389
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:27,567
For now, let us give
Rubinsky a bit more time.

390
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:30,942
If he should abandon
his mother planet, Earth,

391
00:24:31,025 --> 00:24:35,233
the next journey he takes will
be to the realm of the dead.

392
00:24:35,317 --> 00:24:36,775
Yes.

393
00:24:36,858 --> 00:24:40,233
It is not as if
no progress has been made.

394
00:24:40,317 --> 00:24:43,233
One of the men in
power has already fallen

395
00:24:43,317 --> 00:24:45,233
under our influence.

396
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:48,483
The other will surely do
the same soon enough.

397
00:24:48,567 --> 00:24:50,692
I promise you,
the Church of Terra

398
00:24:50,775 --> 00:24:52,733
will not have to wait long.

399
00:24:52,817 --> 00:24:55,942
Our ideals will
soon become reality.
