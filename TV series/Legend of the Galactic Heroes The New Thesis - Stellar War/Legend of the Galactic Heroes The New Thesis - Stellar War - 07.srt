From this point forward,

00:00:23,608 --> 00:00:25,983
our fleet will head
for Shampool.

00:00:26,067 --> 00:00:28,983
While they may be traitors,
before we engage in combat

4
00:00:29,067 --> 00:00:32,358
with fellow Alliancemen, there's
something I'd like to say.

5
00:00:33,858 --> 00:00:35,150
[YANG]
Not long ago when visiting

6
00:00:35,233 --> 00:00:37,858
the capital planet Heinessen,
I made a request

7
00:00:37,942 --> 00:00:41,275
of Space Fleet
Commander-in-Chief Bewcock.

8
00:00:41,358 --> 00:00:43,608
He then granted me a decree.

9
00:00:43,692 --> 00:00:46,733
It states that in the event of
a coup d'état such as this,

10
00:00:46,817 --> 00:00:49,400
our fleet would strike it down
and restore law and order.

[JULIAN gasps]

12
00:00:52,192 --> 00:00:53,942
[JULIAN] I don't quite
understand why we're going

13
00:00:54,025 --> 00:00:57,608
to Shampool
instead of Heinessen.

14
00:00:57,692 --> 00:00:59,150
It's simple.

15
00:00:59,233 --> 00:01:02,608
They could disrupt both our
communications and supply lines.

16
00:01:02,692 --> 00:01:05,567
To prevent that, we need to
establish new supply bases

17
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:07,275
while we still can.

18
00:01:07,358 --> 00:01:10,358
I see. But no
matter what they do,

19
00:01:10,442 --> 00:01:13,067
their commander
isn't Yang Wen-li.

20
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:16,733
That's true, but there
may be a future Yang Wen-li.

21
00:01:16,817 --> 00:01:19,067
I mean, who even knew
the name before the battle

22
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:21,317
of El Facil, right?

23
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,900
If we weren't at war,
no one would know who I am.

24
00:01:24,983 --> 00:01:29,067
I'd still just be an aspiring
historian in some library.

25
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:31,150
Yes, but instead,
you've become one

26
00:01:31,233 --> 00:01:33,608
of the subjects for
historians to study.

27
00:01:35,192 --> 00:01:36,650
You know,
I've heard that Yang Wen-li

28
00:01:36,733 --> 00:01:38,608
is apparently a pretty big deal.

29
00:01:38,692 --> 00:01:40,192
Funny that we both
share the same name

30
00:01:40,275 --> 00:01:41,983
when we're nothing alike.

31
00:01:42,067 --> 00:01:44,400
[JULIAN chuckles]
That humility is exactly what

32
00:01:44,483 --> 00:01:46,608
makes you so respectable.

33
00:01:46,692 --> 00:01:49,233
Most people'd be lost in
their own self-importance

34
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:51,983
if they were in your position.

35
00:01:52,067 --> 00:01:56,525
Julian, you shouldn't flatter
your superiors so much.

36
00:01:56,608 --> 00:01:58,733
The weak-willed will
start to believe you

37
00:01:58,817 --> 00:02:01,150
and they'll ruin
themselves in the process.

Yes. Understood, sir.

Well, as long as we're clear.

[NARRATOR] On April 26th
of the year UC 797,

42
00:03:46,692 --> 00:03:51,108
the Yang Fleet began its assault
on the planet Shampool.

43
00:03:51,192 --> 00:03:54,358
As the traitors on Shampool
had no garrison fleet,

44
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:57,817
the battle was fought
primarily on the ground.

45
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,900
With the Rosen
Ritter at the helm,

46
00:03:59,983 --> 00:04:02,275
Yang's ground forces
subjugated the traitors

47
00:04:02,358 --> 00:04:04,775
with their far
superior strength.

48
00:04:04,858 --> 00:04:07,567
Shampool was set free
within only three days.

Good work today.

52
00:04:20,483 --> 00:04:22,900
Judging by appearance,
the civilians gave you quite

53
00:04:22,983 --> 00:04:24,858
the warm welcome, didn't they?

54
00:04:24,942 --> 00:04:29,358
Ha! Well, the job's
gotta come with some perks.

55

What brings everyone up here?

57
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:34,650
It turns out someone from

58
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:36,983
the Department of Intelligence
has fled to us from Heinessen

59
00:04:37,067 --> 00:04:39,525
and is now requesting
an audience.

60
00:04:39,608 --> 00:04:41,608
We're all here
awaiting his arrival.

61
00:04:41,692 --> 00:04:44,817
Huh. From Intelligence?

62

Unrelated, I see Lieutenant

Hmm.

00:04:52,483 --> 00:04:53,775
Looks like he's here.

00:04:56,317 --> 00:04:58,442
[YANG]
Have there been any executions?

Not at the moment, no.

67
00:05:00,817 --> 00:05:03,608
However, key officials
such as Chief Cubersly,

68
00:05:03,692 --> 00:05:06,608
and Fleet Commander-in
Chief Bewcock have been detained

69
00:05:06,692 --> 00:05:09,442
and subsequently
removed from power.

00:05:09,525 --> 00:05:14,108
I see. And what's the status
of each of the fleets?

00:05:14,192 --> 00:05:15,775
I'm glad we're getting
straight to it.

72
00:05:15,858 --> 00:05:18,025
I came here specifically because
there's something I must

tell you regarding that.

Not only that,

I appreciate you
telling me about this.

If we're prepared for their
arrival, we can minimize losses.

that I could be of some help.

of the position she's in.

In my father's study.

95

He was upset with the
current political system.

openly complaining.

Oh, he's sleeping like a log.

little something special.

It'll be a while before he
regains consciousness.

was correct after all.

With the information
he obtained from Baghdash.

Yang used the enemy's
strategy against them,

focusing efforts on the main
fleet at their left flank.

It's the Yang Fleet!

How did that man know
what we were going to do?

Could Baghdash have told him?

The main fleet on the left flank
has encountered the enemy, too.

167

They believe that
it is Yang's squadron.

[FISCHER] There's no need
to defeat the enemy.

We only need to slow them down

We don't even need to
waste time picking a target!

Keep firing until
there's nothing left!

They're obviously trying
to provide backup

and there's no reason
for us to let them.

I, Legrange, have
taken the responsibility

of giving all ships in the 11th

I consider it an honor
to have fought this battle.

To think my final one would be
against such a renowned admiral.

However, though our fleet
may have been defeated

With Legrange's suicide,

00:13:17,983 --> 00:13:22,108
the Battle of the Doria
Starzone came to an end.

228
00:13:22,192 --> 00:13:26,192
The Yang fleet's goal was to
minimize losses on both sides,

229
00:13:26,275 --> 00:13:29,442
but the opposition's faith
remained steadfast,

230
00:13:29,525 --> 00:13:32,150
resulting in
a bitter conclusion.

231
00:13:38,775 --> 00:13:40,692
[PATRICHEV]
Ever since Baghdash woke up,

232
00:13:40,775 --> 00:13:43,150
he's been completely
insufferable.

233
00:13:43,233 --> 00:13:45,525
He demands wine with
his meals and insists we have

00:13:47,942 --> 00:13:49,025
[ATTENBOROUGH]
Yeah.

236
00:13:49,108 --> 00:13:51,192
But the admiral's seeing
him at the moment.

I'm sure he's setting
him straight as we speak.

Uh... Right...

Go on...

242
00:14:00,358 --> 00:14:02,358
Of course. To put it simply,

243
00:14:02,442 --> 00:14:05,400
I was hoping you would allow me
to work for you from now on.

244
00:14:05,483 --> 00:14:07,108
Is it really
that easy for a man

245
00:14:07,192 --> 00:14:09,400
to completely change
his principles?

246
00:14:09,483 --> 00:14:10,983
[BAGHDASH]
Absolutely.

247
00:14:11,067 --> 00:14:14,108
Principles are nothing, but a
man's means of staying alive.

248
00:14:14,192 --> 00:14:15,942
If they happen to
get in the way of that,

249
00:14:16,025 --> 00:14:18,067
one need only get rid of them.

250
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,567
Is that so?

251
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:22,650
Could you tell me in more
detail what you had in mind?

252
00:14:22,733 --> 00:14:24,108
First, I feel I should tell you

253
00:14:24,192 --> 00:14:26,817
what my goal was
as a covert agent.

254
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:29,400
It was to assassinate you,
Admiral Yang.

255
00:14:30,775 --> 00:14:33,108
I genuinely believed
this coup d'état had a chance

256
00:14:33,192 --> 00:14:34,650
at being successful.

257
00:14:34,733 --> 00:14:38,108
Which is why I was willing to
accept such a risky mission.

258
00:14:38,192 --> 00:14:41,983
But... It's clear now
my judgement was wrong.

259
00:14:42,067 --> 00:14:45,317
Your abilities far
surpassed my expectations,

as well as those of the National
Salvation Military Council.

261
00:14:48,817 --> 00:14:51,233
And so, I've been
left with no other choice.

262
00:14:51,317 --> 00:14:53,733
I'll accept the truth
of the situation.

263
00:14:53,817 --> 00:14:55,483
No choice, huh?

264
00:14:55,567 --> 00:14:58,483
That's the entire reason you
want to work for the opposition?

265
00:14:58,567 --> 00:15:00,067
[BAGHDASH chuckles]
That's right.

266
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:04,192
If I'm being honest, I've grown
tired of idling my life away.

00:15:04,275 --> 00:15:06,775
And I don't particularly
dislike working.

some kind of job to do?

All right, then. I'll surely
find a use for you eventually.

his loyalty to you now,

but there's no telling
what he'll do in the future!

The possibility of danger
is not a good reason

00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:59,483
of a new era for the Alliance,
Jean Robert.

315
00:18:11,067 --> 00:18:14,733
[gasping]

316
00:18:17,567 --> 00:18:19,275
[CHRISTIAN]
You...

317
00:18:19,358 --> 00:18:22,025
Citizens clinging
to your arrogant ideals.

318
00:18:22,108 --> 00:18:23,567
Have you gathered
here aware that

319
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:25,817
you are under martial law?

320
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,858
[laughs]

321
00:18:31,942 --> 00:18:34,358
Hey. Pick ten of them
out from the crowd

322
00:18:34,442 --> 00:18:36,192
and put them up on the stage.

323
00:18:36,275 --> 00:18:38,150
[SOLDIER 19A]
Yes, Sir!

324
00:18:38,233 --> 00:18:41,025
[MEN grunting]

325
00:18:41,108 --> 00:18:43,233
[CHRISTIAN]
How about some answers?

326
00:18:43,317 --> 00:18:48,025
You all must have a leader.
Is it Jessica Edwards?

327
00:18:48,108 --> 00:18:49,692
Don't know.

328
00:18:49,775 --> 00:18:51,442
Is that a fact?

329
00:18:51,525 --> 00:18:52,483
Well, then...

330
00:18:52,567 --> 00:18:54,442
Let me jog your memory!

331
00:18:54,525 --> 00:18:55,317
[MAN A yells]

332
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,858
[PROTESTERS gasping]

333
00:18:57,942 --> 00:18:59,525
[CHRISTIAN]
Goodness, what's wrong?

334
00:18:59,608 --> 00:19:01,233
Are you not feeling well?

335
00:19:03,067 --> 00:19:05,192
Perhaps you can help me.

336
00:19:06,733 --> 00:19:08,192
Is Jessica Edwards...

337
00:19:08,275 --> 00:19:09,942
--...your leader?!
--[JESSICA] Captain Christian!

338
00:19:13,608 --> 00:19:15,358
[CHRISTIAN]
Speak of the devil.

339
00:19:15,442 --> 00:19:17,900
Assemblywoman Edwards.

340
00:19:17,983 --> 00:19:20,567
[JESSICA] Why have you brought
armed soldiers to interfere

341
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:22,983
with a peaceful assembly?

342
00:19:23,067 --> 00:19:26,192
To restore order,
I would think it's obvious.

343
00:19:26,275 --> 00:19:27,525
Take a look at yourselves.

344
00:19:27,608 --> 00:19:29,483
Don't you think you're
the ones disturbing order

345
00:19:29,567 --> 00:19:32,608
with your show of violence?
You struck a man.

346
00:19:32,692 --> 00:19:36,317
Exactly what part of that
would you call "order"?

347
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,942
[CHRISTIAN chuckles]

348
00:19:38,025 --> 00:19:41,692
We're the ones who decide
the definition of that word.

349
00:19:41,775 --> 00:19:43,858
End this assembly at once.

350
00:19:43,942 --> 00:19:46,400
If you don't understand
"order," we will be happy

351
00:19:46,483 --> 00:19:49,733
to demonstrate it for you.

352
00:19:49,817 --> 00:19:51,483
That's enough, Captain!

353
00:19:51,567 --> 00:19:54,192
[CHRISTIAN grunts]
Ge-Get off!

354
00:19:55,067 --> 00:19:56,233
[JESSICA yelps, grunts]

355
00:19:59,108 --> 00:20:01,983
[CHRISTIAN] Not a single one
of you is even prepared to die,

356
00:20:02,067 --> 00:20:04,233
yet you run your mouths to me?!

357
00:20:05,692 --> 00:20:08,442
[JESSICA]
So if you're prepared to die...

358
00:20:08,525 --> 00:20:12,692
...you can just do whatever
you want, no matter how stupid?

359
00:20:12,775 --> 00:20:14,192
What?!

360
00:20:14,275 --> 00:20:17,442
[JESSICA] History has
seen people like you...

361
00:20:17,525 --> 00:20:19,275
People who used
violence to force

362
00:20:19,358 --> 00:20:22,733
their ideas of
justice on others.

363
00:20:22,817 --> 00:20:27,025
Most notably... was the
founder of the Galactic Empire:

364
00:20:27,108 --> 00:20:29,525
Rudolf von Goldenbaum.

365
00:20:29,608 --> 00:20:31,108
Then there's you...

366
00:20:31,192 --> 00:20:33,233
At the bottom of that list.

367
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:37,650
You're just an unworthy
disciple to Rudolf.

368
00:20:37,733 --> 00:20:39,150
[CHRISTIAN growls]

369
00:20:39,233 --> 00:20:42,317
[JESSICA]
Reflect on that.

370
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:48,692
You have... no right
to be here now. So...

371
00:20:48,775 --> 00:20:53,358
...take your soldiers and
leave this place immediately.

372
00:20:54,775 --> 00:20:57,858
[CHRISTIAN]
Those... eyes...

373
00:20:57,942 --> 00:21:00,733
Who the hell do
you think you are?!

374
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,483
[CHRISTIAN]
Hmph.

375
00:21:12,567 --> 00:21:13,817
[CITIZEN 19A snalrs]

[PROTESTERS yelling]

377
00:21:15,108 --> 00:21:17,192
[SOLDIER 19A]
Stop! Stop or we will shoot!

378
00:21:17,275 --> 00:21:19,233
--I swear we'll do it!
--[screaming, shouting]

379
00:21:19,317 --> 00:21:21,858
It doesn't matter! Just shoot!

--[gunshot]
--[CHRISTIAN grunts]

381
00:21:25,025 --> 00:21:26,692
[SOLDIER 19C] One of them got
hold of a weapon somehow!

382
00:21:26,775 --> 00:21:28,983
[SOLDIER 19D]
Sir... We can't handle this!

383
00:21:29,067 --> 00:21:31,358
We have no choice!
Permission to fire!

384
00:21:31,442 --> 00:21:33,192
Don't move!
Do it and I'll shoot!

385
00:21:33,275 --> 00:21:33,858
[CITIZEN 19D]
Get him!

386
00:21:33,942 --> 00:21:35,650
[CITIZENS grunting]

387
00:21:43,192 --> 00:21:46,233
[NARRATOR] In this incident
which would later be known

388
00:21:46,317 --> 00:21:50,858
as the Stadium Massacre,
20,000 civilians

389
00:21:50,942 --> 00:21:56,275
and 1,500 soldiers
lost their lives.

390
00:21:56,358 --> 00:21:58,733
All of whom
were fellow citizens

391
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:01,192
of the Free Planets Alliance.

392
00:22:07,483 --> 00:22:09,067
[gasps]

393
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:11,317
I can't believe
he was so reckless.

394
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,650
And now... he may have
just driven all the citizens

395
00:22:13,733 --> 00:22:15,525
to revolt at once.

396
00:22:15,608 --> 00:22:18,942
Which means we would
lose our people's support.

397
00:22:19,025 --> 00:22:20,692
We'd become a minority.

398
00:22:24,483 --> 00:22:25,942
How can this be...?

399
00:22:30,233 --> 00:22:31,858
[NARRATOR]
News of the Stadium Massacre

400
00:22:31,942 --> 00:22:34,733
did not reach the
Hyperion instantly.

401
00:22:34,817 --> 00:22:36,942
It was late by one month.

402
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:40,233
[YANG sighs]
Looks good.

403
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:42,858
You have permission to deliver
this notice to all ships.

404
00:22:42,942 --> 00:22:44,442
I'll get right on that.

405
00:22:46,025 --> 00:22:48,358
[NARRATOR] When he learned
of Jessica's death,

406
00:22:48,442 --> 00:22:51,692
Yang decided to wear
sunglasses for the entire day

407
00:22:51,775 --> 00:22:53,775
in order to hide his expression.

408
00:23:15,192 --> 00:23:19,525
[NARRATOR] At the end of July,
in the year UC 797,

409
00:23:19,608 --> 00:23:22,692
Yang's fleet was
approaching its destination,

410
00:23:22,775 --> 00:23:25,942
and would soon
arrive at Heinessen.
