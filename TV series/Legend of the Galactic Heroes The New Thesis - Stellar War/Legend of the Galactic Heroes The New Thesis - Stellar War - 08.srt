with their unworthy hands?

318
00:18:09,983 --> 00:18:13,192
[BRAUNSCHWEIG] Prepare to launch
a nuclear strike on Westerland.

319
00:18:13,275 --> 00:18:15,275
[gasps]
Please, Your Excellency!

320
00:18:15,358 --> 00:18:16,692
Collect yourself!

321
00:18:16,775 --> 00:18:20,025
Don't let a single one
of those peasants escape alive!

322
00:18:20,108 --> 00:18:21,858
I beg of you to reconsider this.

323
00:18:21,942 --> 00:18:24,275
Have you forgotten that
planet is your domain?

324
00:18:24,358 --> 00:18:25,900
Why not simply
punish the ringleaders?

325
00:18:25,983 --> 00:18:28,192
[BRAUNSCHWEIG]
Silence! It's my territory!

326
00:18:28,275 --> 00:18:29,775
So it's my decision!

327
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:30,942
[ANSBACH gasps]

328
00:18:31,025 --> 00:18:32,483
[BRAUNSCHWEIG]
When Emperor Rudolf purged

329
00:18:32,567 --> 00:18:35,442
hundreds of millions of the
unworthy, was he not laying

330
00:18:35,525 --> 00:18:38,817
the very foundation of
the Galactic Empire itself?

331
00:18:41,067 --> 00:18:42,525
I see.

332
00:18:42,608 --> 00:18:45,817
Then it appears the Goldenbaum
Dynasty has come to an end.

333
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,025
What?!

334
00:18:47,108 --> 00:18:49,442
After cutting off
its every last limb,

335
00:18:49,525 --> 00:18:52,692
how can a nation
continue to stand?

336
00:18:52,775 --> 00:18:53,942
Watch your tongue!

337
00:18:54,025 --> 00:18:56,150
Not only do you dare
to insult my honor,

338
00:18:56,233 --> 00:19:00,067
but you would openly sully
the name of the late Emperor?

339
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:01,567
Someone, come quickly.

340
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:03,942
This man is a traitor
to the Empire!

341
00:19:04,025 --> 00:19:06,817
Throw him in a prison
cell at once!

342
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,192
--[guns clicking]
--[ANSBACH sighs]

343
00:19:10,317 --> 00:19:12,233
[REINHARD]
You're sure that's the truth?

344
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:14,900
Yes, sir, without
a single doubt.

345
00:19:14,983 --> 00:19:16,442
We must send
a fleet to Westerland

346
00:19:16,525 --> 00:19:20,567
and stop the strike immediately.
I will lead it myself.

347
00:19:23,483 --> 00:19:25,275
Just a moment, Your Lordship.

348
00:19:27,525 --> 00:19:29,608
There's another
path for us to take.

349
00:19:29,692 --> 00:19:33,275
We should allow the mad duke to
carry out his heartless plans.

350
00:19:33,358 --> 00:19:34,775
What?!

351
00:19:35,692 --> 00:19:37,733
Once we document the genocide,

352
00:19:37,817 --> 00:19:40,525
then we'll broadcast
it to the Empire.

353
00:19:40,608 --> 00:19:42,858
By exposing their naked cruelty,

354
00:19:42,942 --> 00:19:45,525
we can demonstrate that these
evil people have no right

355
00:19:45,608 --> 00:19:47,692
to govern the universe.

356
00:19:47,775 --> 00:19:49,442
That would be far
more beneficial to us

357
00:19:49,525 --> 00:19:52,525
in the long run than
halting the attacks.

358
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:55,692
[REINHARD growls] You want to
let two million people die?!

359
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:57,775
That's including
women and children!

360
00:19:57,858 --> 00:19:59,733
And even more
lives will be lost.

361
00:19:59,817 --> 00:20:02,442
If this civil war
drags on, that is.

362
00:20:02,525 --> 00:20:06,483
This is for the 25 billion
citizens of the Empire, sir.

363
00:20:06,567 --> 00:20:08,400
And of course,
for the swift establishment

364
00:20:08,483 --> 00:20:10,817
of Your Excellency's hegemony.

[CITIZEN 20A sighs]
We've finally won our freedom.

375
00:21:04,067 --> 00:21:05,317
But we need to
think carefully about

376
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,317
what we're going to do next.

377
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,067
[CITIZEN 20B]
They say that Marquis Lohengramm

378
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:13,150
is a man of the people.
We should ask him to protect us.

379
00:21:13,233 --> 00:21:15,733
[CITIZEN 20C] You're right.
He's our only hope!

00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:18,858
Hey, Mom? What are those?

381
00:21:30,483 --> 00:21:32,400
[NARRATOR]
With a single flash,

382
00:21:32,483 --> 00:21:35,192
the image of destruction
triggered shock and outrage

383
00:21:35,275 --> 00:21:37,400
throughout the Empire.

384
00:21:37,483 --> 00:21:40,817
Any public sentiment
in favor of the old regime,

385
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,442
and the high nobility,

386
00:21:42,525 --> 00:21:44,233
was extinguished.

387
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,108
How truly heartbreaking.

388
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,942
Who could do such a thing...?

389
00:21:52,233 --> 00:21:53,692
Come to think of it,

390
00:21:53,775 --> 00:21:55,983
one of the nobles who came in
to surrender said something

391
00:21:56,067 --> 00:21:58,733
that won't stop bothering me.

392
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:00,233
They claimed it was a setup.

393
00:22:00,317 --> 00:22:01,858
That Marquis Lohengramm...

394
00:22:01,942 --> 00:22:04,858
He was told in advance
that this would happen.

[KIRCHEIS gasps]

396

Supposedly, he ignored it.

397
00:22:08,233 --> 00:22:09,858
And let those people die.

398
00:22:09,942 --> 00:22:11,983
Just to make
a political statement.

399
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:14,483
[KIRCHEIS]
He wouldn't...

400
00:22:15,567 --> 00:22:17,067
I asked him
if he had any proof,

401
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:19,192
but he said the very
existence of this footage

402
00:22:19,275 --> 00:22:21,108
was all the evidence we needed.

...I'll ask that you tell me
the truth yourself.
