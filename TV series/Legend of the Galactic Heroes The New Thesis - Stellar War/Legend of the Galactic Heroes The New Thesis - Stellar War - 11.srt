00:11:11,233 --> 00:11:13,067
we currently lack leadership.

164
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:15,275
As you might imagine,
we're at a loss.

165
00:11:15,358 --> 00:11:19,150
So I don't suppose you have
something to contribute?

166
00:11:19,233 --> 00:11:20,817
I just might.

167
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,192
Well?

168
00:11:24,067 --> 00:11:27,192
We ought to request assistance
from the Marquis' sister.

169
00:11:27,275 --> 00:11:29,983
You suggest we ask
Countess Grünewald?

170
00:11:30,067 --> 00:11:31,942
The subject was
brought up earlier, but--

171
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:35,275
[OBERSTEIN] Allow me to
assume that responsibility.

172
00:11:35,358 --> 00:11:39,233
And I have an undertaking
to assign you as well.

173
00:11:39,317 --> 00:11:41,025
I'd like you to capture
the man who killed

174
00:11:41,108 --> 00:11:43,817
High Admiral Kircheis.
Immediately.

175
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,608
What a strange thing to say.

176
00:11:45,692 --> 00:11:47,650
Didn't we all watch Ansbach die?

177
00:11:47,733 --> 00:11:49,358
[OBERSTEIN]
He played a minor part.

178
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:51,400
We'll make an official
statement that the mastermind

179
00:11:51,483 --> 00:11:55,025
was someone else.
Someone much more significant.

180
00:11:55,108 --> 00:11:56,900
Who, then?

181
00:11:56,983 --> 00:12:00,025
The Prime Minister,
Duke Lichtenlade.

182
00:12:00,108 --> 00:12:01,525
[gasping]

183
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,150
I'd surely never want to make

184
00:12:05,233 --> 00:12:09,608
an enemy out of you.
Victory would be impossible.

185
00:12:09,692 --> 00:12:12,108
Our allegiance with the man
was always temporary

186
00:12:12,192 --> 00:12:14,192
and his elimination inevitable.

187
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:16,942
Also, it's not as though he has
been conducting operations

188
00:12:17,025 --> 00:12:19,608
with the purest of intentions.

189
00:12:19,692 --> 00:12:21,192
There's no question.

190
00:12:21,275 --> 00:12:23,817
He's been concocting his own
devious plan to sabotage

191
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:26,233
Marquis Lohengramm.

192
00:12:26,317 --> 00:12:27,400
In other words,

193
00:12:27,483 --> 00:12:30,275
the charges wouldn't
be completely false.

194
00:12:30,358 --> 00:12:33,067
[OBERSTEIN] You must return
to Odin as soon as possible.

195
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:37,150
You'll arrest Duke Lichtenlade.
And take the state seal.

196
00:12:37,233 --> 00:12:42,233
After that, we can establish
his excellency as dictator.

197
00:12:42,317 --> 00:12:43,817
But whoever
obtains the seal first

198
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:46,400
could just choose to stay
in the capital, right?

199
00:12:46,483 --> 00:12:49,483
What would happen if they tried
to claim leadership themselves?

200
00:12:49,567 --> 00:12:50,942
[OBERSTEIN]
Hardly a concern.

201
00:12:52,317 --> 00:12:54,442
If anyone acted
on such an ambition,

202
00:12:54,525 --> 00:12:56,150
they would be swiftly
compromised by

203
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:58,192
the other admirals.

204
00:12:58,275 --> 00:13:00,942
None of you would
resign yourselves to submit.

205
00:13:01,025 --> 00:13:04,442
Especially not to
an officer of equal rank.

206
00:13:04,525 --> 00:13:05,900
It's exactly why
I've always thought

207
00:13:05,983 --> 00:13:08,650
having a second-in-command
was unnecessary.

208
00:13:10,608 --> 00:13:11,983
[REUENTHAL]
Well.

209
00:13:12,067 --> 00:13:14,983
Power is not justified
by how you acquire it.

210
00:13:15,067 --> 00:13:16,692
The only thing that matters
is the way in which

211
00:13:16,775 --> 00:13:18,650
you choose to wield it.

212
00:13:18,733 --> 00:13:21,650
Meaning that a bit
of scheming is unavoidable.

213
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:30,650
[REUENTHAL]
It's decided.

214
00:13:30,733 --> 00:13:32,858
We shall seize the chance to
purge Marquis Lohengramm's

215
00:13:32,942 --> 00:13:36,358
enemies and reclaim absolute
supremacy in his name.

216
00:13:40,983 --> 00:13:43,067
[MITTERMEYER]
Leave the stragglers behind.

217
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:45,358
They'll all find their way
to Odin eventually.

[NARRATOR] The fleet was
20,000 ships strong when it left

It shrank more and more

By the time it reached
the capital planet Odin,

the fleet's numbers
dwindled down to 3,000.

On what grounds?

against Marquis Reinhard

You buffoon!

What evidence could you even
possess to prove such nonsense?

236

I'm the Imperial Prime Minister!

That may be so,
but the fact remains

But Sister--!

320
00:19:24,275 --> 00:19:25,525
I think...

321
00:19:25,608 --> 00:19:28,150
...it's best if I
seclude myself from you.

322
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:31,192
The two of us live
very different lives.

323
00:19:31,275 --> 00:19:33,900
Now in my life,
there's only the past.

324
00:19:33,983 --> 00:19:35,400
But in yours...

325
00:19:35,483 --> 00:19:38,067
You have the whole future.

326
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:42,525
If you're tired,
come and visit me anytime.

327
00:19:42,608 --> 00:19:45,067
Of course, you mustn't
grow too weary just yet,

328
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:47,192
dear brother.

329
00:19:49,025 --> 00:19:50,817
I understand.

330
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,942
If that's truly what you desire,

331
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,733
then I will do as you please.

332
00:19:56,108 --> 00:19:59,900
Once I've claimed the universe,
I'll come by and see you.

333
00:19:59,983 --> 00:20:03,483
However, there's
something I wanted to ask.

334
00:20:05,983 --> 00:20:08,733
[REINHARD]
Before we part, please tell me.

335
00:20:08,817 --> 00:20:11,233
Did you... love Kircheis?

336
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:28,025
[REINHARD]
I've been briefed on our status.

337
00:20:28,108 --> 00:20:30,067
On the day that
all of you set out,

338
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:31,858
Oberstein gave me a full report.

339
00:20:31,942 --> 00:20:33,275
Sir.

340
00:20:33,358 --> 00:20:36,233
You'll be duly rewarded
for your distinguished service.

341
00:20:36,317 --> 00:20:38,692
I'm currently en route
to Odin myself.

342
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:42,733
We've apprehended
Duke Lichtenlade's family.

343
00:20:42,817 --> 00:20:45,900
They're all in confinement,
and they are now anticipating

344
00:20:45,983 --> 00:20:47,358
your judgment.

345
00:20:47,442 --> 00:20:49,275
[REINHARD]
You needn't wait for my arrival.

346
00:20:50,817 --> 00:20:52,858
I'm entrusting
all of you to punish them.

347
00:20:52,942 --> 00:20:54,192
Understood?

348
00:20:54,275 --> 00:20:55,608
[REUENTHAL]
Very well.

349
00:20:55,692 --> 00:20:58,317
And what would you have us
do with the Duke himself?

350
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,692
We can't very well execute

351
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:03,400
the Imperial Prime Minister.
Encourage his suicide.

352
00:21:03,483 --> 00:21:05,983
Via the most painless
method possible.

353
00:21:06,067 --> 00:21:07,358
[REUENTHAL]
Noted.

354
00:21:07,442 --> 00:21:10,233
Now then, how should we
proceed with the relatives?

355
00:21:10,317 --> 00:21:12,900
[REINHARD] Banish women
and children to the frontier.

356
00:21:12,983 --> 00:21:15,525
Put all men over
the age of ten to death.

357
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:18,400
Yes, sir.

358
00:21:18,483 --> 00:21:20,858
Ages nine and under
are not to be harmed, then?

359
00:21:20,942 --> 00:21:24,775
I myself was ten years old
when I first started school.

360
00:21:24,858 --> 00:21:27,817
Anybody younger than that
has yet to fully mature.

361
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,358
So they are exempt.

362
00:21:29,442 --> 00:21:32,525
Of course, they're welcome
to try and strike me down

363
00:21:32,608 --> 00:21:33,983
once they've grown up.

364
00:21:34,067 --> 00:21:35,983
It's only natural that
an incompetent leader

365
00:21:36,067 --> 00:21:37,817
should be overthrown.

366
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:40,025
[laughs]

367
00:21:40,108 --> 00:21:41,567
The same goes for you.

368
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:43,400
If you have the
confidence to defeat me,

369
00:21:43,483 --> 00:21:45,275
then by all means, attempt it.

370
00:21:45,358 --> 00:21:47,525
You can have at me
any time you like.

371
00:21:49,942 --> 00:21:51,817
Surely you're joking.

372
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,983
I'll be taking my leave, then.

373
00:21:54,067 --> 00:21:55,358
[REINHARD]
Superb work.

374
00:21:57,817 --> 00:21:59,150
[OBERSTEIN]
Your Excellency.

375
00:21:59,233 --> 00:22:00,858
Are you certain that is
what you want to do

376
00:22:00,942 --> 00:22:02,942
with the Lichtenlade family?

377
00:22:03,025 --> 00:22:04,900
I've shed a considerable
amount of blood

378
00:22:04,983 --> 00:22:08,900
in my lifetime.
And I will surely shed more.

379
00:22:08,983 --> 00:22:10,858
I don't see how
adding a few more drops

380
00:22:10,942 --> 00:22:13,442
from their family
makes any difference.

381
00:22:13,525 --> 00:22:16,150
It's negligible in the end.

382
00:22:16,233 --> 00:22:17,525
If it pleases you,

383
00:22:17,608 --> 00:22:19,150
then so be it.

384
00:22:30,525 --> 00:22:34,317
[NARRATOR] Having lost Kircheis,
and now his sister,

385
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,150
Reinhard's entire being
was starved with yearning.

386
00:22:38,233 --> 00:22:42,025
Even if he became the
absolute ruler of all humanity,

387
00:22:42,108 --> 00:22:45,525
would that satisfy
the hunger in his heart?

388
00:22:45,608 --> 00:22:47,900
The answer appeared doubtful.

389
00:22:47,983 --> 00:22:51,858
It seemed his incredible
longing could not be satisfied.

390
00:22:51,942 --> 00:22:55,233
Perhaps... it never would.

391
00:22:55,317 --> 00:23:00,067
And thus, Reinhard was left
with no other path to follow.

392
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:03,483
He could only counter his
melancholy with warfare.

393
00:23:03,567 --> 00:23:09,692
By continuing to fight, win,
and conquer in an endless cycle.

394
00:23:09,775 --> 00:23:12,775
But for that,
he would need an enemy.

395
00:23:12,858 --> 00:23:15,442
The stronger and more
competent they were,

396
00:23:15,525 --> 00:23:19,608
the more he could forget the
pain of his ravenous heartache.

397
00:23:19,692 --> 00:23:22,275
And he had the strongest,
most competent enemy

398
00:23:22,358 --> 00:23:26,900
he could ever hope for
in the Free Planets Alliance.

399
00:24:58,983 --> 00:25:02,150
