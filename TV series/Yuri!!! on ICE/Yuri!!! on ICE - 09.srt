Hey, Yuri.

stuck in his throat.

[YURI] Victor! You need
to get back to Japan.

It will just be for tomorrow.

One day only, will you
be Yuri's coach?

Ask Yakov if you need help
or don't understand something.

just hug him,

I'm sorry, Yuri.

I know I won't be here,
but I'll be with you in spirit.

the final event of
the Grand Prix Series.

Each skater came
into this competition

with his own hopes and fears,

His theme for this season:

"Cyberpunk: I've
ceased to be human."

50

Just as the theme suggests,
he plans four quads,

51
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:25,125
a superhuman feat.

52
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:27,291
That was a beautiful
quadruple Salchow.

And well done!

That was by far the best program
I've ever seen you do.

Eh, <i>si</i> ?

such mean things to you earlier.

But I'm glad I did!

Hey, Yakov.

What is it?

00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:52,583
I'm changing the

Huh?

172

I'll reduce the number of jumps

in the first half
from four to two.

174

So you'll have six
in the second half?

That's right.

That's suicide.

I can win against JJ and Yuri.

he suffered a huge loss

in the standings and has no hope

of advancing to

former prima ballerina
of the Bolshoi Ballet.

195
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:49,291
For his senior debut,

well known for its
difficulty and intensity.

197

This is the first season
he's been allowed

Yes. Dance with beauty.

Most people don't realize beauty
is a force of righteousness.

Without beauty,
strength means nothing.

You aren't a weak person, Yuri.

Hey.

Vitya designed that

take advantage of it.

This is where Victor learned it.

I can tell that much
from your free skate.

I'm the only king here.

[MOROOKA] He's planned four
quads for this program.

If he follows through

his free skate program will have
the highest technical difficulty

of all the skaters

At Skate Canada,
he held off Russia's star

Yuri Plisetsky to
claim first place.

365
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:01,333
He came in third at last
year's Grand Prix Final.

With Victor Nikiforov
absent this season,

it seems a new prince in
the figure skating world

[JEAN-JACQUES]
That's where you're wrong.

I'm no prince.
I'm already a king!

371
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:16,666
[JEAN-JACQUES]
When I designed this program,

372
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:19,875
I thought to myself, "I'll be
the one who stops Victor

373

from claiming a
sixth consecutive

375
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:26,083
Of course, I didn't
know he'd quit.

376
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:29,916
I bet he ran because he was
afraid of losing to me.

into the overall performance.

466
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:41,583
Yes, now!

467
00:21:43,791 --> 00:21:47,708
Hey, there's rice in here.
Pork and egg, too.

468
00:21:47,791 --> 00:21:48,750
Wait, is this...?

469
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:50,041
Da!

470
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:51,666
My grandpa made them himself!

471
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:52,625
Aren't they great?

472
00:21:52,708 --> 00:21:55,041
Yeah! They're <i>vkusno</i> !

473
00:21:57,208 --> 00:22:00,208
[YURI] There's so much
I wanna tell you, Victor.

474
00:22:00,291 --> 00:22:02,958
What do I say first?

475
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:04,250
[MAKKACHIN barks]

476
00:22:06,875 --> 00:22:08,333
[YURI gasps]

477
00:22:11,333 --> 00:22:13,250
[panting]

478
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:15,791
[panting]

479
00:22:20,875 --> 00:22:23,458
[panting]

480
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:27,333
[VICTOR]
Yuri.

481
00:22:27,416 --> 00:22:29,083
I've been thinking
about what I should do

482
00:22:29,166 --> 00:22:32,416
going forward as your coach.

483
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,125
[YURI]
Yeah, so have I.

484
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:41,583
Victor, will you...

485
00:22:41,666 --> 00:22:43,916
...be my coach...

486
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,791
...until I retire?

487
00:22:48,416 --> 00:22:49,666
[VICTOR sighs]

488
00:22:51,791 --> 00:22:53,041
[VICTOR kisses]

489
00:22:53,125 --> 00:22:55,458
That sounded like
a marriage proposal.

490
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:56,833
[gasps]

491
00:23:02,583 --> 00:23:05,583
[VICTOR] In that case,
I hope you never retire.

492
00:23:05,666 --> 00:23:09,625
[YURI gasps, whimpers]

493
00:23:09,708 --> 00:23:13,166
[YURI] Let's win gold together
at the Grand Prix Final.

494
00:23:16,791 --> 00:23:18,000
[VICTOR]
Finally! Vacation!

495
00:23:18,083 --> 00:23:19,375
Where's my swimsuit?

496
00:23:19,458 --> 00:23:21,125
[YURI] This may be a resort,
but it's still winter.

497
00:23:21,208 --> 00:23:22,833
[VICTOR] Oh, right.
It's almost Christmas.

498
00:23:22,916 --> 00:23:24,166
What are you going
to give me, Yuri?

499
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:25,833
[YURI]
Something round and golden.

500
00:23:25,916 --> 00:23:26,750
[VICTOR]
Wow!

501
00:23:26,833 --> 00:23:27,666
[YURI]
Next time, Tenth Skate:.

502
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:28,916
[VICTOR]
"Gotta Supercharge It!

503
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,875
[YURI, VICTOR]
Pre-Grand Prix Final Special!"
