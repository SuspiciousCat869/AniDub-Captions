I overslept! Um... are you?

I have to say, you

This whole experience
has been surreal.

a coach of my very own

here with me every day.

And not just any
coach--Victor Nikiforov!

19
00:02:28,625 --> 00:02:29,708
I guess it's good that he said

20
00:02:29,791 --> 00:02:31,375
I could pay his
coaching fees later,

how I'm gonna do that.

when there's
something on your mind.

[VICTOR]
I've been thinking.

29
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:51,333
I wonder if three quads in
your free program is too many.

30
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:52,583
Why?

31
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:54,083
Uh... If I want to win
the Grand Prix Final,

32
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:55,791
I need to keep those jumps in!

33
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:56,833
Not true.

34
00:02:56,916 --> 00:02:58,375
You can get by
with just one quad.

35
00:02:58,458 --> 00:03:00,250
Just get a perfect score
on the program components,

36
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:01,458
and you're good to go!

[photo snap]

38
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,583
[YURI] Let me pause here to
explain how scoring works

39
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:06,833
in figure skating.

40
00:03:06,916 --> 00:03:09,458
Jumps and spins count
toward a technical score.

41
00:03:09,541 --> 00:03:11,166
Choreography and
interpretation count toward

42
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:12,833
presentation score.

43
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:15,208
The skater's total score
is the sum of those two,

44
00:03:15,291 --> 00:03:17,375
minus any deductions.

45
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:18,833
When I skate,
I tend to get nervous

46
00:03:18,916 --> 00:03:21,166
and lose technical points
by missing jumps.

47
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,708
I usually make up ground
with my presentation score,

48
00:03:23,791 --> 00:03:26,625
but it's not always enough.

49
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:28,125
I need to do more.

50
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,666
I'll never win this way.

51
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,375
Something has to change.

52
00:03:31,458 --> 00:03:33,125
[VICTOR]
Yuri, you know why I'm here,

53
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:35,041
why I decided to
become your coach?

54
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:35,958
[YURI]
Huh?

55
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:37,125
[VICTOR]
I was drawn to you

56
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:39,125
because of the way
you move to the music.

57
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:40,750
Like the song's
already inside you

58
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:43,000
and you're using
your body to release it.

59
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:44,458
You need a
high-difficulty program

60
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:46,541
to maximize that potential.

61
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:49,791
I knew, I could give you that.

62
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:52,458
And the short program
confirmed that I was right!

63
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:54,833
Now we're moving on
to the free program.

64
00:03:54,916 --> 00:03:57,041
And I think you should
produce this one yourself.

65
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:59,625
Huh? But my coach has always
chosen my music for me.

66
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:00,791
I wouldn't know where to start--

67
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:02,375
[VICTOR]
It's more fun to do it yourself.

68
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:03,791
You can really personalize it!

69
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:05,625

to my coach doing it.

Hey, I was wondering.

00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:36,416
Why didn't you ever let
Yuri choose his program music?

86
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,625
[CELESTINO]
Huh?

87
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:39,708
I usually select the
music for my skaters.

88
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:42,500
But I don't mind letting them
chose if that's what they want.

89
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:45,125
Yuri only brought me a piece
once while I was coaching him.

90
00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:47,583
I think he'd had a
friend of his compose it.

91
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:50,208
It wasn't bad,
the song was okay...

92
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:52,833
So this is the music
that's going to get you a win?

93
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:54,166
[YURI]
Uh...

94
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,791
You know, maybe you should
pick something for me.

95
00:04:56,875 --> 00:04:59,000
He just never had much
confidence in himself

96
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:00,375
or his decisions.

97
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:02,666
I told him a million times
to trust himself more,

98
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,583
but I don't think
it ever helped.

99
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:06,041
That's good to know, thank you.

100
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:07,083
Um, hold on.

101
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:09,583
Celestino, one more thing.

102
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:12,291
At the next Grand Prix Final,
I'm going to make you proud.

103
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:15,500
Hmm. I'm glad to hear that.

104

say after last year's final.

older than you are.

Hello, Coach Yakov.

No. Sorry, sir.

140
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:28,333
[MIRA] Yuri seems different
since he got back.

141
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:29,666
I wonder why.

142
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,541
He used to complain
about practice.

143
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:33,958
There was no one in his
bracket who could rival him.

144
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:35,291
He knew that and

145
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:37,208
it made him arrogant
and unwilling to work hard.

146
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:39,208
I think that face-off
with Yuri Katsuki

147
00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:41,041
was a wake-up call for him.

148

We may have a very

00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:11,041
Whatever you say.

162
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:12,250
Who the hell are you?

163
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:13,250
[LILIA] The person
choreographing

164
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:15,000
your free program.

165
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:16,125
That's right.

166
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:18,208
And my expectations
for you are high.

167
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:20,833
You will be more than
a principal this season.

168
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:23,583
Yes, you will be
the prima ballerina.

169
00:07:23,666 --> 00:07:27,250
If you want to win, you must
be willing to sell your soul.

170
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:29,666
[MIRA]
Well, she's intense.

171
00:07:31,291 --> 00:07:33,958
I want victory, whatever
the cost might be.

172
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:37,416
If it means winning, then I will
sell my body and soul to you.

173
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,458
[LILIA]
Hmph.

174
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,625
I am Lilia Baranovskaya.

175
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:43,250
I want you to go home
and pack up your things.

176
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:44,625
We have a great deal
of work to do,

177
00:07:44,708 --> 00:07:46,500
so you'll be staying with me.

178
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:47,958
So will you, Yakov.

179
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:49,000
[YAKOV]
Lilia!

180
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:50,708
[LILIA]
Don't get excited, old man.

181
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:53,083
This doesn't mean we're
getting back together.

182
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:56,458
[YAKOV] No! That's not
what I was aiming for.

183
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:58,083
I don't really get why,
but for some reason

184
00:07:58,166 --> 00:08:00,625
Yurio's coach brought in his
ex-wife to help with training,

185
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:03,250
and apparently she yells
at him like 24 hours a day.

186
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:05,291
[YURI] Yeah?
That doesn't sound like fun.

187
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,541
Anyway, have you
chosen the music

188
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:07,958
for your free program yet?

189
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:10,416
[YURI] Well, I did
have Victor listen to one.

190
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,666
Oh, okay.

191
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:12,791
So this is it, huh?

192
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:14,125
[YURI]
He wasn't exactly a fan.

193
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:16,416
Let's consider some
other possibilities, huh?

194
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:20,416
[YURI] Usually, I would
just let my coach pick

195
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,750
whatever music he
thought was best.

196
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:25,833
And then I'd let him
choreograph it, too.

197
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:27,166
Not Victor.

198
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,916
He did it all himself.

199
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,500
He'd have new music written
to create the story he wanted

200
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:34,666
to tell and then choreograph
his routine to tell it.

201
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:37,500
I did dream about doing
that myself someday,

202
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:39,375
but it just never happened.

203
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:47,041
[YURI]
Hmm...

204
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:51,208
Oh... How's Phichit?

205
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:53,583
He's practicing back
home in Thailand.

206
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,541
[YURI]
Uh. Hey, Phichit.

207
00:08:57,625 --> 00:08:58,375
<i>Sawasdee krab</i> .

208
00:08:58,458 --> 00:08:59,333
What's up, Yuri?

209
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:00,291
It's been a long time.

210
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:01,333
Good to hear from you!

211
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:02,458
So I guess you
left Detroit behind

212
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:04,666
to go practice back
in Thailand, huh?

213
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,208
Sure did. What can I say?

214
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:08,708
Detroit just wasn't
the same after you left.

215
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:10,666
You should come visit me
in Bangkok sometime.

216
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,000
I'll show you around.

217
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:14,208
[YURI laughs]
<i>Khob khun</i> , <i>krap</i> .

218
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:17,416
Anyway, I was wondering,
think you could do me a favor?

219
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,291
You remember that
demo I had made?

220
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:20,333
Yeah.

221
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:21,750
By that one
conservatory student.

222
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:23,916
You asked her to compose
it for you, right?

223
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,166
[YURI]
Uh-huh.

224
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:27,458
But then I didn't
end up using it after all.

225
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:28,500
Sorry.

226
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:29,791
I know you went
to a lot of trouble.

227
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:31,000
[CONSERVATORY GIRL]
No, it's all right.

228
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:32,708
Just keep it.

229
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:34,875
Sorry again.

230
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:36,208
Anyway.

231
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:37,791
It felt kind of awkward
to talk to her after that.

232
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:38,416
[PHICHIT]
Yeah.

233
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,750
I can see why.

234
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:42,041
If you want, I could try
to track her down for you.

235
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:44,375
I'm sure she's not mad.

236
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:48,625
[YURI] The piece never
did feel quite right.

237
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:51,458
I always thought there was
something weak about it.

238
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:53,666
Though I guess that makes sense.

239
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,000
When I asked her to compose it,

240
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:57,583
I said I was looking for
something to represent me,

241
00:09:57,666 --> 00:10:01,041
something that would embody
my skating career as a whole.

242
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:05,958
[YURI] So I guess she
got it right in the end.

243
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:08,916
An underwhelming piece
for an underwhelming career.

244
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:13,083
[YURI] What should
I have done differently?

245
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:15,041
[LILIA]
No, no, no!

246
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:16,208
Forget who you were!

247
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:18,125
Your past self
is dead, understand?

248
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:20,083
The only people who succeed

249
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:21,625
are those who are
willing to be reborn

250
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:24,208
as many times as necessary!

251
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:28,208
[VICTOR] What? You still
haven't chosen the music?

252
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:29,875
Trust your intuition.

253
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:31,708
Find something
that inspires you.

254
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:33,000
It could even be a memory.

255
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:34,708
Like when a girl
said she loved you.

256
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:36,500
What?!

257
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:38,458
Huh? I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

258
00:10:38,541 --> 00:10:39,583
I didn't mean to snap at you.

259
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:41,666
I'm just really
stressed right now.

260
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,041
[VICTOR]
No. It's my fault.

261
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:45,250
I forgot you've
never had a lover.

262
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:49,000
Yuri! Why don't
we go get some food?

263
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:50,166
I'm okay, thanks.

264
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,541
Yuri! Want to soak
in the springs together?

265
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:52,750
I'm going to sleep.

266
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:55,541
[VICTOR] Yuri!
How about a slumber party?

267
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:06,333
I can't do it!
The guilt's gonna kill me!

268
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,291
Let's skip practice today.

269
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:09,958
We can go down to the ocean.

270
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:13,000
[trembles]
Yeah, okay.

271
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:22,000
[VICTOR]
Ah. Seagulls.

272
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:23,416
[YURI]
Black-tailed gulls.

273
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,250
I love the sound they make.

274
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:27,500
Whenever I hear
their calls in the morning,

275
00:11:27,583 --> 00:11:30,375
it makes me think
I'm back in St. Petersburg.

276
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:32,000
I never thought
I would leave the city,

277
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:35,625
so I didn't take the time to
appreciate the seagulls' cries.

278
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:38,000
But now I find them
strangely comforting.

279
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:41,208
Have you ever
felt like that before?

280
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:42,375
[YURI]
Back in Detroit,

281
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:44,000
there was this girl who
was really pushy,

282
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:47,125
always talking to me and
asking how I was doing.

283
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:49,666
Then one day a rink
mate had an accident.

284
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:50,541
I was worried.

285
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:51,958
Really worried.

286
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:54,875
That girl was in the hospital
waiting room with me.

287
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:58,416
She tried to give me a hug,
you know, to comfort me.

288
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,125
But I just reflexively
shoved her away.

289
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:04,250
Wow. Why would you do that?

290
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:05,750
[YURI] It felt like
she was trying to say

291
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:07,833
I was weak or something.

292
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:10,916
She was intruding on feelings
she didn't have any right to.

293
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,375
And I hated it.

294
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:15,041
That made me think
about everyone back home.

295
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:18,500
Minako, Yuko,
Nishigori, my family.

296
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:20,833
They never treated me
like I was a weakling,

297
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:23,041
someone who needed
his hand held.

298
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:25,333
They had faith that
I would continue to grow,

299
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:27,333
and they let me do it,

300
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:30,875
helping me without ever
making me feel weak.

301
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:33,541
You aren't a weak person, Yuri.

302
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:36,208
Nobody who knows you
would ever think that.

303
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:40,750
Will you tell me: What is
it you want me to be to you?

304
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:42,000
A father figure?

305
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:43,041
[YURI]
No.

306
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:45,541
A brother?
Or just a friend?

307
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:46,458
[YURI]
Hmmm...

308
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:47,666
[VICTOR]
So, then, your lover.

309
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:48,625
I can try my best.

310
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:50,500
No, no, no, no, no!

311
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:53,458
All I want is for you
to be who you are.

312
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:55,833
[YURI]
I look up to you.

313
00:12:55,916 --> 00:12:58,041
I always have.

314
00:12:58,125 --> 00:13:00,416
I was afraid to let
you see my shortcomings.

315
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:03,875
I guess that's why
I've been avoiding you.

316
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:07,750
I'll make it up to you
by skating my best.

317
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:09,083
You have a deal.

318
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:11,500
And I won't let you off easy.

319
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:13,958
That's my way of
showing my love.

320
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:20,833
[YURI] When I open up,
he meets me halfway.

321
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:25,083
[YURI] I think it's time
to open up more.

322
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:28,000
[YURI sighs]

323
00:13:29,916 --> 00:13:31,125
Huh?!

324
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:34,333
[YURI]
I heard back.

325
00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:35,708
She said she's going
to redo the music!

326
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:36,791
[VICTOR]
Sounds good.

327
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:38,166
Looking forward to hearing it.

328
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,708
[YURI]
Until it's ready, um...

329
00:13:40,791 --> 00:13:42,500
I want to learn all your jumps!

330
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:44,791
Teach me everything you can do.

331
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:00,208
Absolutely unacceptable.

332
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:02,583
Even the king crab we ate
yesterday had better control

333
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:04,375
of its legs than you!

334
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:06,333
Again, from the same place.

335
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:07,250
Well?

336
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:08,583
Ma'am!

337
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:10,041
[YAKOV]
It might be for the best

338
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:13,000
that he's not training in
Victor's shadow anymore.

339
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:15,166
He's learning that
strength isn't only

340
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:17,500
about how confident you appear.

341
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:20,166
[YURI]
That was good.

342
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:21,708
If it's all right with you, I'd
like to try it one more time.

343
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:24,583
Uh, we've done it ten
thousand times already.

344
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:26,041
[YURI]
Thirteen, actually.

345
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:27,750
[VICTOR]
I've thought this for a while,

346
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:29,541
but your stamina is
pretty impressive.

347
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:31,750
[YURI]
Yeah. I've got that, at least.

348
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:33,791
[VICTOR] Maybe your nervous
eating during competitions

349
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:35,833
helps keep you going longer.

350
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:38,625
There's also the fact that you
haven't had any major injuries,

351
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:40,083
and you're younger than me.

352
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:44,291
Uh!! I just couldn't help it!

353
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:45,833
Sorry!

354
00:14:45,916 --> 00:14:47,125
[VICTOR]
Is it getting that thin?

355
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:47,916
No, no, no, no!

356
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,458
It's very thick and shiny!

357
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:50,666
[VICTOR]
You've wounded me.

358
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,666
I don't know if
I will ever recover.

359
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,208
[YURI] I'm sorry, I don't
know what I was thinking!

360
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:55,791
I didn't mean anything by it...

361
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:57,583
[NISHIGORI] Well, those two seem
to get along pretty well, huh?

362
00:14:57,666 --> 00:14:59,083
[YUKO chuckles]

363
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:02,458
[YURI]
It's here!

364
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:04,583
Victor! Listen!

365
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:05,291
[MAKKACHIN yelps]

366
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:06,458
[YURI]
Oops, sorry!

367
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:09,041
It's the music for
the free program!

368
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:23,291
[VICTOR] Hmm... We could
go for a bit more impact.

369
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:25,708
Maybe make the last jump
a quadruple toe loop.

370
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:27,208
[YURI]
Really? The last one?

371
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:28,500
[VICTOR] I think someone
with your stamina

372
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:30,000
should be able to pull it off.

373
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:30,833
But if you'd rather not.

374
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:32,083
I'll do it!

375
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:34,625
Good. That's what I was
hoping you would say.

376
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:36,500
Oh, yeah. One more thing.

377
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:38,583
Did you change
the musical theme?

378
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:40,833
Uh, yeah, I did.

379
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:42,375
[VICTOR]
So, what is it?

380
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:46,666
I've decided--the piece's
theme is "on my love."

381
00:15:49,625 --> 00:15:51,541
I think that's a perfect choice.

382
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:53,208
Well done.

383
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:55,458
Okay. Let's finish this program!

384
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:57,333
[YURI]
Yeah!

385
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:19,291
[MINAKO]
No way!

386
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:20,541
Yes! They announced them!

387
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:22,666
This year's assignments
for the Grand Prix!

388
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,333
Oh, crap! Oh, crap! Oh, crap!

389
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:25,416
What are you doing up?

390
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,583
Do you have any
idea what time it is?

391
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:28,000
Mom, the assignments!

392
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:29,333
Oh crap! Oh crap!

393
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:30,375
[YAKOV]
Yuri!

394
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:32,416
Where is he?
The assignments are in!

395
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:36,208
[PLISETSKY] First I want
to know, the Japanese piggy:

396
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:38,083
Where is he assigned?

397
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:40,250
Congratulations, Yuri!

398
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:43,416
Hooray! Yay!

399
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,333
Thanks, everybody.

400
00:16:44,416 --> 00:16:45,541
Now we can take a closer look

401
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:47,166
at the events you'll
be competing in.

402
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:48,458
Hold on a second!

403
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:50,250
Somehow the Katsuki
family still doesn't know

404
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:51,458
how figure skating works.

405
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:53,583
[LOOP]
So how about a quick tutorial?

406
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:54,416
[HIROKO]
Thank you.

407
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,666
That would be helpful, dear.

408
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:58,916
What is the Figure
Skating Grand Prix Series?

409
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,166
Skaters with high scores
from the previous season

410
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:03,375
participate in a maximum
of two competitions

411
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:05,500
out of a total of six worldwide.

412
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:07,375
Only the top six skaters
from those meets

413
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:09,375
advance to the
Grand Prix Final,

414
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:11,291
which determines
who is number one.

415
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:12,791
They announced
who will be competing

416
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:15,500
and this year Yuri's first
assignment is the third event,

417
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:16,708
the Cup of China.

418
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:18,291
Yuri's former rink mate,
Phichit of Thailand,

419
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:20,250
will be competing too!

420
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:21,916
Ah! It'll be good to see him!

421
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
And it looks like

422
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:24,458
his second assignment
is going to be.

423
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:26,833
The sixth event,
Russia's Rostelecom Cup.

424
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:30,250
where he'll be up against his
arch nemesis, Yuri Plisetzky!

425
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:31,291
Go, Yurio, go!

426
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:32,541
[YURI]
So I'll be going against him

427
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:33,500
even before the final.

428
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:34,791
[MAKKACHIN whines]

429
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:35,958
I trust you'll
look after the house

430
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:38,291
during the season
for us, Makkachin?

431
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:39,625
[YURI]
That's right.

432
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:41,500
This will be my first time
in a Grand Prix Series

433
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:43,625
without Victor in the lineup.

434
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:44,916
I wonder how people
are gonna react

435
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,083
when they see you.

436
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:47,500
Showing up with
Victor as your coach,

437
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:49,791
they'll probably think you
stole him from the sport.

438
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:50,875
[YUKO]
You'll be hated

439
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:52,708
by millions of skating
fans worldwide!

440
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:54,291
Uh...

441
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:55,375
[YUKO]
Just kidding!

442
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:57,041
We're totally on
your side, Yuri!

443
00:17:57,125 --> 00:17:58,291
[MINAKO]
Hell yeah, we are!

444
00:17:58,375 --> 00:18:00,375
I'll be there to cheer
you on this season, too!

445
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:01,583
First stop, Cup of China.

446
00:18:01,666 --> 00:18:02,375
Here we come!

447
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:03,041
Wait a second.

448
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:03,833
Nationals last year.

449
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,500
Yeah, I forgot about that.

450
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:06,500
I wish I could forget.

451
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:08,458
I screwed up and
came in eleventh.

452
00:18:08,541 --> 00:18:09,791
Okay.

453
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:11,333
So you have to compete in
the block championships.

454
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:12,666
What are those?

455
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,916
Oh, we're talking about
domestic competitions now.

456
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,375
[photo snap]

457
00:18:16,458 --> 00:18:18,041
[YUKO] Yuri had a major loss
in last year's National's.

458
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:19,583
That means
he won't automatically

459
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:22,125
make the cut for this season's
championship and has to work

460
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:24,833
his way up from qualifying
competitions instead.

461
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:27,083
So his first event this season
is the regional competition

462
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:30,166
for Chugoku, Shikoku,
and Kyushu in September.

463
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:31,416
It'll be his big comeback!

464
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,333
Great. You'll breeze
through that, won't you?

465
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:36,250
Well, Minami from
Fukuoka will be there.

466
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:38,500
[LOOP] Yeah. He beat
Yuri in the Nationals.

467
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:41,208
[LUTZ] Minami Kenjiro of
Kyushu said to be the number one

468
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:43,708
rising star among
younger skaters.

469
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:45,875
September.

470
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,500
[YURI] Hard to believe
it's already been so long

471
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:50,208
since the day
I thought I was finished.

472
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:51,000
[TOSHIYA]
Good, good.

473
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:52,333
So exciting.

474
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:54,541
We'll be there
to cheer you on!

475
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:56,208
I'm sure you'll do great.

476
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:57,666
Thanks a lot, Dad.

477
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,958
[TOSHIYA] Plus, it'll be
great publicity for the inn!

478
00:19:00,041 --> 00:19:01,208
[YURI]
Dad.

479
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:02,875
[HIROKO] You'll autograph
a sign, won't you?

480
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:04,250
[YURI]
Until recently,

481
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:07,250
I thought I was fighting
all by myself.

482
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:12,208
But then, Victor came, and
I don't feel that way anymore.

483
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:14,458
Some things have changed.

484
00:19:14,541 --> 00:19:16,000
Some are still the same.

485
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:19,416
But now everything feels so new.

486
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:23,583
I may never be able to regain
what I've lost, but that's okay.

487
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:25,083
Because for the first time

488
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:28,708
I can remember--I can clearly
see what's in front of me.

489
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:33,750
[music plays]

490
00:19:57,291 --> 00:19:58,291
Okay, again.

491
00:19:58,375 --> 00:20:00,000
From the beginning this time.

492
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,458
[gasps]

493
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:03,708
[YAKOV]
Huh...?

494
00:20:03,791 --> 00:20:06,291
You're starting
to understand, Yuri.

495
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:09,375
Beautiful.

496
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:12,083
He was so reluctant
to begin with,

497
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:15,833
but he really is becoming
a prima ballerina.

498
00:20:15,916 --> 00:20:17,125
[PLISETSKY]
I only have a short window

499
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:19,333
before my body begins to change.

500
00:20:19,416 --> 00:20:23,000
I need to use every advantage
I have, while I still have it.

501
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:24,708
I will win.

502
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:51,750
[YURI] Figure skaters
are only competitive

503
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:53,416
for a short time.

504
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,458
[YURI]
This will probably be

505
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:56,416
my last competitive
skating season.

506
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:12,291
I don't how long
Victor will stay with me.

507
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:15,291
Or how long my
body will hold up.

508
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:19,208
So please, God,
while he <i>is</i> here,

509
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:22,875
help me make the most of
the time we have together.

510
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:23,750
One thing missing.

511
00:21:23,833 --> 00:21:24,958
You haven't named the piece.

512
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:26,625
What are you going to call it?

513
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:34,625
Yeah. I'd say that's perfect.

514
00:21:36,416 --> 00:21:39,666
[YURI]
Not long now. In September...

515
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:43,083
...my season with
Victor will finally begin.

516
00:23:17,208 --> 00:23:18,833
[YURI]
My first competition in a while.

517
00:23:18,916 --> 00:23:19,750
I'm nervous!

518
00:23:19,833 --> 00:23:21,125
[VICTOR]
It's my coaching debut!

519
00:23:21,208 --> 00:23:23,208
Yuri, what would you
like me to wear?

520
00:23:23,291 --> 00:23:25,000
[YURI]
Uh, I dunno, clothes?

521
00:23:25,083 --> 00:23:26,791
"Fifth Skate: Face Beet-Red!!

522
00:23:26,875 --> 00:23:28,291
It's the First Competition!"

523
00:23:28,375 --> 00:23:31,166
"The Chu-Shikoku-Kyushu
Regional Championship."

524
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:31,916
Stay tuned!
