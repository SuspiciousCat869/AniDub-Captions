00:00:15,708 --> 00:00:19,958
[YURI] Over the years, he has
never ceased to surprise me.

2
00:00:20,041 --> 00:00:22,541
From the first time
I saw him skate,

3
00:00:22,625 --> 00:00:26,500
till now, it's been one
surprise after another.

00:01:57,291 --> 00:01:59,875
[AUDIENCE cheering]

5
00:01:59,958 --> 00:02:01,083
[MOROOKA]
Sure enough,

6
00:02:01,166 --> 00:02:03,041
he's crushed the
free skating event, as well.

7
00:02:03,125 --> 00:02:05,833
This marks the fifth consecutive
Grand Prix Final win

8
00:02:05,916 --> 00:02:08,541
for Russian legend
Victor Nikiforov.

9
00:02:09,916 --> 00:02:12,166
[MOROOKA]
Nikiforov is now 27 years old.

10
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:14,583
Some speculate that he
might retire this season,

11
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:16,125
but his masterful
performance here

12
00:02:16,208 --> 00:02:18,041
may lay such rumors to rest.

13
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:20,125
Now let's talk
about Yuri Katsuki,

14
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:23,166
who was here competing in his
very first Grand Prix Final.

15
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,291
What are your thoughts, Honda?

16
00:02:24,375 --> 00:02:25,625
[HONDA]
I hate to say it,

17
00:02:25,708 --> 00:02:27,541
but he didn't perform
like his usual self today.

18
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:29,000
[CELESTINO]
Put that down!

19
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:30,833
Looking at the news
won't do you any good.

"Katsuki tumbles to last place.

22
00:02:35,416 --> 00:02:36,458
[CELESTINO]
Yuri.

23
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:37,750

[photo snap]

25
00:02:39,208 --> 00:02:40,875
[YURI]
My name is Yuri Katsuki.

26
00:02:40,958 --> 00:02:43,583
At 23, I'm one of the
dime-a-dozen figure skaters

27
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:45,750
certified by the JSF.

28
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:47,166
I had high hopes,

29
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,833
but I came in last at
my first Grand Prix Final.

30
00:02:49,916 --> 00:02:52,291
I'm still having a
hard time accepting that.

31
00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:54,666
I moved to Detroit to
train at a top-notch facility

32
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,458
and worked hard to qualify.

33
00:02:56,541 --> 00:02:58,416
But before the match,
the pressure got to me,

34
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,666
and I started binge-eating.

35
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,208
Then the family dog died.

36
00:03:01,291 --> 00:03:02,833
I was a complete wreck.

37
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:05,750
So my big day
became a big failure.

38
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:09,166
Man. Talk about self-sabotage.

39
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:12,000

Hey, Mom.

Were you sleeping? Sorry.

00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:17,333
Yeah. I figured
you'd seen it on TV.

42
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:19,208
What? You had a viewing party?

43

They call him
the "Russian Punk."

56

Why does he look like he's
trying to decide whether

57
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:06,666
or not to punch me?

Maybe it's time
for you to retire.

It's a little early for that.

made a decision yet.

[YURI] Hi, everyone
who cheered me on

127
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:35,458
just because I'm from Hasetsu!

128

I can't bring myself
to say this out loud,

last year's gone for me.

The figure skating competition
season generally starts

I couldn't shake off the failure
and lost again in the Nationals.

I didn't make it into
the Four Continents

or the World Championships,
so the season's over for me!

00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:57,166
I managed to graduate college,

137
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,375
but I ended things with my
coach, and my future's unclear.

00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:13,833
[MOROOKA] The song he's
chosen is "Stay Close to Me."

318
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:17,416
I wonder how many women are
watching this now and drooling.

319
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,208
About a million? I mean,
he is one fine specimen.

320
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:22,625
[HIROKO] I think you've had
enough to drink, Minako.

321

[MOROOKA]
Flawless Quad Sal!

322
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,500
[MINAKO] I don't know
if this is the best music

323
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:32,291
for a worldly man
like him, though.

324
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:36,041
It would work better for
a dewy-eyed youngster.

325
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:38,125
Ya know?

326
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:27,125
[MOROOKA]
A triple Lutz.

327
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,583
[MOROOKA]
A triple flip!

[gasps]

329
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:50,875
[MOROOKA]
Now, the last quad is coming up.

330
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:54,333
A quadruple toe loop,
followed by a triple toe loop!

331
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:57,708
That's it! He did it.
He landed all his quads!

332
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:01,958
[MOROOKA] Now all that's
left is a combination spin.

[YUKO]
You're freaking amazing!

337
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:30,291
That was a
perfect copy of Victor!

338
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:35,333
[chuckles] Honestly,
I thought you'd be depressed.

339
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:36,916
[YURI]
I was,

340
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,791
but it turns out being depressed
gets pretty old after a while.

341
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:43,458
I lost my love for skating,
and I wanted it back.

342
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:46,083
I thought if I copied Victor
like we did in the old days,

343
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:47,458
it would help.

344
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:51,208
Yuko. I've been thinking...

345
00:17:51,291 --> 00:17:52,958

With his fifth consecutive gold

[FEMALE INTERVIEWER A] What
do you think the next season

aren't they?

Uh, Yeah...

Wow, you really
did get fat, Yuri!

00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:13,041
So you're retiring?

You've never had a girlfriend?

Hey! Ignore them!
The girls are groupies, sorry!

Come by to practice any time.

got your back, you know that

You can do it, Yuri!

[YURI]
A lot happened while I was away.

373
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:37,791
For the most part, I ignored it.

374
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:40,083
I focused on skating
and nothing else.

I wish I knew what to do now.

I want to keep skating.

00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:48,833
But can I do it on my own?

in earnest to join

the world's preeminent

Look, Yuri. I'm really sorry.
