from the Grand Prix
Series' Cup of China.

5
00:01:44,041 --> 00:01:46,666
I received a personal best
score in the short program,

00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:48,416
which landed me in first place.

Well done, Yuri!

That was seriously amazing!

No, no, no! I totally did!

You didn't take
a nap, did you, Yuri?

00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:39,833
Huh? I did, I did, I did!

31
00:02:39,916 --> 00:02:42,208
You're not allowed any
jumps during warm-up.

32
00:02:42,291 --> 00:02:43,291
Huh?

33
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:45,291
That's an official order
from your coach.

34
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:47,333
[MOROOKA] We've reached
the second half of the event,

35
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:49,666
and Group 2 is taking the ice.

36
00:02:50,166 --> 00:02:51,958
[VICTOR] If he flubs
a jump during the warm-up,

37
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:53,916
it will only shake his
confidence even more

00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,958
going into the free skate.

39
00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:58,166
He gets nervous too easily.

00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:02,583
[MOROOKA] Let's hope skater
Katsuki is all right.

41
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:05,208
He doesn't look very
happy after his warm-up.

Oh, my poor Yuri.

That look on his face.

I've seen that look
a lot, and it's never good.

00:03:09,541 --> 00:03:10,750
[VICTOR] You can
land it in competition

46
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:12,375
even if you didn't
during practice.

47
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:13,750

[GUANG-HONG'S COACH]
Okay, you can do this!

We prepared this program
especially for today.

China's young ace, age 17.

00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:38,666
He's in sixth place
after the short program.

58
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,166
He will be skating to
"The Inferno,"

00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:42,041
from the movie <i>Shanghai Blade</i> .

His theme this year is
"bonds and violence."

["The Inferno" playing]

62
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:47,750
[GUANG-HONG]
I went with this music

63
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:49,333
because my coach
pushed it so hard,

64
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:52,875
but I don't see how skating as
an assassin can make me a hero.

65
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,083
[MOROOKA]
Looks like he over-rotated,

66
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:57,541
but that's another quad toe loop

67
00:03:57,625 --> 00:03:59,875
after the one in
his short program.

68

[GUANG-HONG]

but after this last job,
I'm starting a new life.

With my sword in hand,
nothing is going to stop me.

than it did in warm-up.

He landed all the jumps

of his program.

How does the story go from here?

88
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:50,625
The protagonist
infiltrates the enemy lair

89
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:55,666
and fights his way to the top,
where the enemy boss awaits.

90
00:04:57,541 --> 00:04:58,458
[GUANG-HONG]
He's surprised to run

91
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:00,166
into an old friend.

92
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,208
It's easier to skate,

93
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:03,250
now that the
pressure to win is off.

94

[MOROOKA]
Here comes the step sequence!

95
00:05:04,916 --> 00:05:07,666
Look at that speed--it's
like watching a car chase.

He's barreling
toward the finish!

[GUANG-HONG] With his
friend guarding his back,

the enemy organization's boss.

This wasn't my last stand.

just gives up without a fight.

He will be skating to

His technical score
in the short program

120
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,791
was below Guang-hong Ji's,

121
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:16,916
but his presentation
score was much higher,

122
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,041
allowing him to place fifth,
above the skater from China.

123
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:22,958
He has prepared three
quads for the first half

the high-difficulty

He's far from where he was

131

at the European Championships,
but he seems

132

even more focused
than in the short program.

Hmm. Thanks, Chris. Here.

Yuri cannot surpass you.

I'm going to win this season.

And after I do, I'll bring
you back to the ice with me.

someday, I know it.

His combined score is 283.81.

[ANNOUNCER A] Representing
Thailand, Phichit Chulanont.

182

[MOROOKA] Thailand's
Phichit Chulanont, age 20.

00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:07,416
He's skating to a

Yeah!

with Phichit since his
short program yesterday.

191

Unlike Yuri,
he has plenty of charm

and tremendous innate flair.

[MOROOKA]
The loud cheers we're hearing

from the audience tell us
they have high expectations

195
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:40,125
for skater Chulanont.

196
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:42,333
Coming up next is a triple Lutz.

197
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:44,666
[PHICHIT] Chris and
Yuri are always ahead of me,

with their two types of quads

199
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:48,375
and high scores on
performance components.

200
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:50,583
My best bet is to
skate my heart out

201
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:52,083
and put all my quads
in the second half

[MOROOKA]
This expressive footwork is

206
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:02,791
one of his unique qualities
as a Thai skater.

207
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:06,666
As we enter the second half,
he has his first quad.

208
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,208
Landed it!

209
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:12,458
[PHICHIT] Until recently,
I doubt anyone thought

210
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:15,541
a Thai skater would land a
quad at a Grand Prix event,

211
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:17,791
but I never stopped
believing in myself,

212
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:20,333
and now I've proven them wrong!

He lands his second quad!

215
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:37,625
[PHICHIT]
I'm not copying anyone else.

216
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:39,750
This is something only I can do.

217
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:41,333
[MOROOKA] All that's left
now is his combination.

218
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:44,083
He's planned a triple flip,
single loop, double flip.

219
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:50,375
[MOROOKA]
He nailed it!

in his first event,
Skate America.

230
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:27,333
Today could possibly
be his first victory.

231
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:28,875
If he wins here,

232
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:30,791
it will put him on the cusp
of being the first Thai skater

to advance to
the Grand Prix Final.

His combined score is 285.76.

That's his top
score of the season,


236
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:41,041
and gives him the
lead over Giacometti.

I'm the one who will save you!

314
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,125
No! You can't leave!

315
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:55,416
Not again!

316
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,625
I refuse to accept it!

317
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:01,166
[screams]

318
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:03,958
[MOROOKA]
Next is a quad Salchow.

319
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:08,083
He fell!

320
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:09,375
[YAKOV]
What's wrong, Georgi?

321
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:10,583
Of all my students,

322
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:12,791
you're the most willing
to let me guide you.

323
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:14,791
A strength and a weakness.

324
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:16,208
I designed this program

325
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:19,125
to realize all the things
Victor lacks as a skater,

326
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:22,250
but you have to perform
it with confidence!

327
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:32,041
[MOROOKA]
Next is a triple flip.

328
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:34,041
[MOROOKA]
Great!

329
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:36,208
He carries himself
with such dignity!

330
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:39,791
[GEORGI]
"Please wake me up!"

331
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:42,166
I can hear your voice, Anya.

332
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:45,500
No matter what happens,
I will kiss you.

333
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:47,833
I will be the one to save you.

334
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:49,791
Then we will be
together forever,

335
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:52,541
as I have always known
we were meant to be.

336
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:54,916
Don't worry, Anya, I'm coming.

337
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,333
You'll never be alone again!

338
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:04,333
Well, Victor, how does it feel,
watching from the sidelines?

339
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:06,708
It's my turn in
the limelight now!

340
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:08,208
[PLISETSKY]
Whoops.

341
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:10,250
Forgot to watch the free skate.

342
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:12,500
I wonder if Yuri
is holding up alright.

343
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:14,333
His eyes look red, don't they?

344
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:15,833
 Yeah, totally red!

345
00:16:15,916 --> 00:16:18,791
Did something happen
between him and Victor?

346
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:20,875
[VICTOR] "You don't
have to say anything."

347
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:24,208
[YURI] Just have more faith
that I'm going to win than I do.

348
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:25,750
[VICTOR] I should have
asked Yakov what to do

349
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:27,625
in situations like this.

350
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:30,750
[MOROOKA]
With a combined score of 252.44,


351
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:32,750
Georgi Popovich
is in third place.


352
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:34,500
There is some
room for improvement.


353
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:36,416
I must try to take this
program to the next level


354
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,791
before the Russian nationals.


355
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:40,250
I'd say there is <i>much</i>
room for improvement.


356
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:58,166
[MOROOKA] The last skater
is Yuri Katsuki, from Japan.

357
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,416
He finished the short
program in first place.

358
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,916
[YAKOV] If your student
is trying to console you,

359
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,625
you still have a long way
to go as a coach, Vitya.

360
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:09,208
[MOROOKA] He will be
skating to "Yuri on Ice."

361
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:10,583
["Yuri on Ice" plays]

362
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:13,416
[YURI] I feel a lot
better after crying.

363
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,458
And the look on Victor's face
when I started to tear up--

364
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:18,625
that was priceless.

365
00:17:18,708 --> 00:17:20,833
[VICTOR]
Why is he smiling?

366
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:23,208
[YURI]
I've cried after a competition,

367
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:25,875
but that's the first time
I've cried before one.

368
00:17:25,958 --> 00:17:27,625
Anyway, the first jump.

369
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:32,125
a quadruple toe loop,
double toe loop combination.

370
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:34,083
[ANNOUNCER B]
Quadruple, double.

371
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:35,958
[shrieks]

372
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:40,041
[YURI]
Better than I expected.

373
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,375
[MOROOKA]
His first quad was a success.

374
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:43,958
In this free skate program,

375
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:48,833
Yuri Katsuki plans to do three
quads of two different types.

376
00:17:48,916 --> 00:17:52,041
He's unusually relaxed today.
I wonder why.

377
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:58,666
Don't fall, don't fall,
don't fall! Don't fall!

378
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:02,666
[YURI] Victor's too
inexperienced as a coach.

379
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:06,416
It's not like it's news that I
get nervous before competitions.

380
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,875
He should have been
prepared for that.

381
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:10,583
Stupid Victor.

382
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:12,541
A quadruple Salchow.

383
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:13,708
[YURI]
Huh. I made it.

384
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:15,833
That was beautiful!

385
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:20,666
[MOROOKA] His theme
for this season is "love."

386
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:24,041
Love changed me.
I'm stronger now.

387
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:26,166
And I'll prove it
at the Grand Prix Final.

388
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:27,333
With a gold medal!

389
00:18:27,416 --> 00:18:28,625
[MOROOKA] He made
a memorable declaration

390
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:30,041
at the press conference.

391
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:35,541
[ANNOUNCER B]
A triple loop.

392
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:37,708
[MOROOKA]
Beautiful.

393
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:01,750
[MOROOKA] One of his
favorites, the triple axel.

394
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:04,750
Oh, no. Looks like
he touched down.

395
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:06,916
[YURI] I could have
controlled the speed better.

396
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,916
Not bad, though, considering
I didn't do it during warm-up.

397
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,208
Next is a triple flip.

398
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:13,791
Hmm.

399
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:16,583
What if I made the last quad
a flip instead of a toe loop?

400
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:19,625
I wonder what Victor
would think about that.

401
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:21,541
[MOROOKA] Up next is
a triple axel, single loop,

402
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:24,958
triple Salchow combination.

403
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:27,791
[AUDIENCE cheers]

404
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,541
[MOROOKA]
He over-rotated on that one.

405
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:32,458
[YURI]
Could be worse,

406
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:34,458
given how little
sleep I've gotten.

407
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:36,708
[MOROOKA] Triple Lutz,
triple toe loop combination.

408
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:38,958
He's not showing any signs
of fatigue even this late

409
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:42,625
in the program as he moves
on to the step sequence.

410
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:45,875
[YURI]
I want to become stronger.

411
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:48,333
I will become stronger.

412
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:51,958
I can surpass Victor's
wildest imagination!

413
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:06,666
[MOROOKA]
For his final jump,

414
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,625
he's planned a
quadruple toe loop.

415
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:12,083
[MOROOKA]
No!

416
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:13,791
He changed it
to a quadruple flip!

417
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:16,333
He fell, but it looked like
there were enough rotations.

418
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:19,833
[MOROOKA] The quadruple
flip was a signature move

419
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:21,666
of Victor Nikiforov, his coach.

420
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:24,125
But not even Nikiforov ever
did a jump of that difficulty

421
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:25,291
at the end of a program,

422
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:27,583
when his fatigue
would be at its peak.

423
00:20:27,666 --> 00:20:30,875
Here is one skater who
just keeps on surprising us.

424
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:34,291
Yuri Katsuki!

425
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:36,541
Huh? Huh?
Was that a quad flip?

426
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:39,583
[pants]

427
00:20:39,666 --> 00:20:43,083
[YURI]
Is he crying? Is he mad?

428
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:44,250
I need to know!

429
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:51,458
[YURI]
Victor!

430
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:54,875
See that? I did great, right?

431
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:10,458
[VICTOR] I wanted
to surprise you more

432
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:11,625
than you've surprised me.

433
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:13,625
This was the only thing
I could think of.

434
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:15,416
Well, it worked.

435
00:21:17,125 --> 00:21:18,208
[YURI]
At the Cup of China,

436
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:20,250
Phichit won his first gold.

437
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:23,791
And I kept Chris in
check by winning silver.

438
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:24,875
Yuri's already proven

439
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:26,541
he's the skater
to beat this year.

440
00:21:26,625 --> 00:21:28,458
Now, with the quad
flip in his roster,

441
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:30,166
I'm sure he'll win
the Rostelecom Cup

442
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:32,250
and advance
to the Grand Prix final.

443
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:34,708
I look forward to returning
to Russia as his coach.

444
00:21:34,791 --> 00:21:36,750
[MIRA]
Hear that, Yuri?

445
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:41,750
[PLISETSKY] In Moscow,
I'll make you into borscht.

446
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:43,875
Little piggy bastard.

447
00:23:17,291 --> 00:23:18,708
[VICTOR] Say the name
of the airport we're landing

448
00:23:18,791 --> 00:23:20,333
at ten times, Yuri.

449
00:23:20,416 --> 00:23:23,000
[YURI] Sheremetyevo,
Sheremetyevo, Sheremetyevo...

450
00:23:23,083 --> 00:23:25,125
[VICTOR] Next time, Eighth
Skate: "Yuri vs. Yuri.

451
00:23:25,208 --> 00:23:26,041
The Horror!!

452
00:23:26,125 --> 00:23:27,541
Rostelecom Cup,
Short Program."

453
00:23:27,625 --> 00:23:29,375
[YURI] One step closer
to the Grand Prix Final!

454
00:23:29,458 --> 00:23:31,291
[VICTOR]
From Russia with love.
