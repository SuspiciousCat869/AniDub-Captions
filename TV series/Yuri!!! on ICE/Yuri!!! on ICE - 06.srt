Come on, Victor!

4
00:01:44,875 --> 00:01:46,583
We'll miss the flight if
we don't get moving!

5

I'll give you a
call from Beijing.

Do your best, dear.
We'll be rooting for you!

7
00:01:50,416 --> 00:01:52,041
I won't be far behind you!

8
00:01:53,166 --> 00:01:55,541
[VICTOR] It's been a long
time since I've flown coach.

9
00:01:55,625 --> 00:01:57,125
Do you have to ask
for the champagne?

10

[YURI] Why don't we
just get some sleep?

11
00:01:58,666 --> 00:02:01,291
[VICTOR] How can I sleep
in a tiny seat like this?

14
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:07,166
one of the top competitors
in Japanese figure skating.

15
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:08,333

[NAOHIKO] Welcome to the Figure
Skating Grand Prix Series,

20
00:02:16,416 --> 00:02:18,083
where the top athletes
in the sport compete

21
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:21,000
to determine the
world's best figure skaters.

22
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:23,791
The race to the podium
has officially begun.

23
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:27,791
At Skate America, Leo de la
Iglesia won his first gold


24
00:02:27,875 --> 00:02:31,041
in his home country, while
Guang-Hong Ji placed third.


25
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:33,375
Both will now compete
in the Cup of China.


26
00:02:33,458 --> 00:02:35,166
At Skate Canada,
Jean-Jacques Leroy,


27
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,375
the bronze medalist in last
year's Grand Prix Final,


28
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:38,833
took home the gold.


29
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:40,958
Fifteen-year-old
Yuri Plisetsky took silver


30
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:43,416
with an impressive performance.


31
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:47,000
And now tomorrow, we move on to
the third event in the series,


32
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:48,416
the Cup of China.

33
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,833
At age 23,

34
00:02:49,916 --> 00:02:51,791
Japan's late bloomer Yuri
Katsuki will be competing

35
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:54,791
for his second consecutive
finals qualification.

36
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:56,250
[YURI] I struggled to
find a theme for this...

37
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:58,041
[NAOHIKO] When asked for
the theme of his program,

38
00:02:58,125 --> 00:02:59,750
he declared it to be "love."

39
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:02,666
[YURI] And I'll prove it
at the Grand Prix Final.

40
00:03:03,541 --> 00:03:06,416
[NAOHIKO] Will the power
of love keep his hopes alive?

41
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,083
Well, the power of love
is really powerful--

42
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:12,250
I'm hungry and this is boring.
Can we go get hot pot now?

43
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:14,000
I'm kinda in the middle
of an interview, here.

44
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:15,666
Oh! That's Yakov!

45
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:16,958
Hey, hey!

46
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:18,250
We're going out for hot pot,
do you wanna come?

47
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:20,125
You're not ignoring me, are you?

Go away.

50
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:25,625
Watching you play pretend coach
makes me sick to my stomach.

51
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:27,083
I don't want to talk to you,

52
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:30,083
not until you beg me to
salvage your skating career.

53
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:31,500
Is that clear enough?

54
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:34,708
[VICTOR] Hmm...
I guess Yakov's not interested.

55
00:03:34,791 --> 00:03:36,625
Let's go!

00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:37,875
Look, look!

58
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:40,041
Drunken shrimp.

59
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:41,791

Why aren't you
eating the shrimp?

63
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:49,583
No raw food for me, not
right before a competition.

64
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:51,125
[VICTOR]
But it's so good!

65
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:54,458
Man, I really ran my stupid
mouth at that press conference.

66
00:03:54,541 --> 00:03:57,416

No, thanks.

It's so yummy, though!

crazy about hot pot.

let me get a selfie with him?

little too much to drink.

00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:54,916
Let's see how he does.

161
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,333
Nailed it!

162
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:58,958
[YURI]
Phichit's been wanting to skate

163
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:01,333
to this music for a long time.

164
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:04,916
Looks like I'm not the only one
who's going all-in this season.

165
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:10,916
[PHICHIT] A lot of people
have skated to this song,

166
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,583
but when I'm finished
here, that won't matter.

167
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:16,416
I'm going to make
this music mine!

168
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,500
[MOROOKA]
More jumps on the way

169
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:19,708
as his program enters
its second half.

170
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:21,708
The first is a combination.

171
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:23,541
[MALE ANNOUNCER]
A triple lutz followed by

172
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:25,125
a triple toe loop.

173
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:26,791
[MOROOKA] Now we have a jump
that he added to the second half

174
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:28,291
to boost his score.

175
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:29,375
[MALE ANNOUNCER]
A quad toe loop.

176
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:30,625
[MOROOKA]
Ah, he fell!

177
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:32,125
[MALE ANNOUNCER]
But He got enough rotations in.

178
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:34,791
[MOROOKA] Back on his feet
continuing the program.

179
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:40,000
[MALE ANNOUNCER]
Next is a combination spin.

180
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:48,750
[CELESTINO] The whole
audience is rooting for him.

181
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:01,916
[YURI]
You did it, Phichit.

182
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,750
You made the music your own.

183
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,875
[AUDIENCE cheers and claps]

184
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:23,541
Bravo!

185
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:24,625
[MOROOKA]
An impressive performance

186
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:26,458
by Phichit Chulanont
of Thailand!

187
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:27,666
Stay cool.

188
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:30,541
[MOROOKA] His short
program score is 86.75.


189
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:34,416
That's a personal best for him
by a considerable margin.


190
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,666
Next up we have a skater

191
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,416
who distinguished himself
at Skate America,

192
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,041
finishing third in the
first event of the series.

193
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:44,000
Guang-Hong Ji of China, age 17,
competing on his home turf.

194
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:46,500
He is skating to
"Le Parfum des Fleurs."

195
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:47,875
[GUANG-HONG]
Phichit was great.

196
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:50,875
I don't know how I'll--
no, I can do this.

197
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:55,916
["Le Parfum des Fleurs" plays]

198
00:08:57,958 --> 00:09:00,291
[MOROOKA] His first planned
jump is a quadruple toe loop,

199
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:02,750
which he added to his
roster this year.

200
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:14,166
All right! He landed
his quadruple toe loop!

201
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:16,375
[YURI]
Watching Phichit perform

202
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:18,541
helped me realize some things.

203
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:20,166
The people who want
to see Victor skate

204
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:23,208
aren't going to be
satisfied with my skating.

205
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:24,666
And the people who have
cheered me on before

206
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:27,000
won't be satisfied
with the old me.

207
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:28,375
[CHRISTOPHE]
Hmm?

208
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:30,000
[YURI] If they're all
going to hate me as the man

209
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:32,791
who took Victor from
the world of skating, fine.

210
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:34,833
I'll prove that I deserve him.

211
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:36,750
Is he all right?
He seems a bit worked up.

212
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:38,750
Shh!

213
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:40,750
Yuri seems different today.

214
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:42,625
What's gotten into him?

215
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:49,916
[MIRA]
Yuri!

216
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,041
Your pal is up.

217
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:52,375
Come and watch with us.

218
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:53,333
[PLISETSKY]
I'm fine.

219
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:55,166
I can see from here.

220
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:56,291
[MOROOKA]
The last skater in Group One

221
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:59,041
is Yuri Katsuki from Japan.

222
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:00,125
[VICTOR]
The time to seduce me

223
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:03,291
picturing pork cutlet
bowls is over.

224
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:06,458
At this point you can do
it just by being yourself.

225
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:09,291
You've figured that out
by now, haven't you?

226
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:12,416
[FEMALE ANNOUNCER] The next
skater, representing Japan...

227
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:15,916
Watch me, Victor.
Don't take your eyes off me.

228
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:22,041
[VICTOR]
He's different today.

229
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:25,708
I don't know what,
but something lit a fire in him.

230
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:33,500
["On Love: Eros" plays]

231
00:10:38,916 --> 00:10:40,500
[MOROOKA]
Right. Yuri Katsuki from Japan

232
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:43,708
is skating his first program
of the Grand Prix series.

233
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:46,500
The music is "On Love: Eros."

234
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:47,583
He has said that the theme

235
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:49,875
for his programs
this year is "love."

236
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:51,375
[MALE ANNOUNCER] Well, he's
certainly a different skater

237
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:53,041
than we've seen in
previous seasons.

238
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:55,041
Maybe living with his
coach, Victor Nikiforov,

239
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:56,708
has helped to bolster
his confidence,

240
00:10:56,791 --> 00:10:58,875
something he's
always struggled with.

241
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:00,166
[MOROOKA]
He sure seems to be delivering

242
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:03,291
on the "eros" part
of the program.

243
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:05,291
[YURI]
They can laugh all they want.

244
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:08,208
They can doubt and
whisper behind their hands.

245
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:10,333
But I'm going to
show them the new me,

246
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:13,791
and when I'm done, they
won't be laughing anymore.

247
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:15,541
Oh! Perfect!

248
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:17,166
[MOROOKA]
Just look at that step sequence!

249
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,708
That was amazing!

250
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:23,208
Oh, wow.

251
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:25,000
[MOROOKA] With his eye
on a place in the final,

252
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:27,291
Katsuki's planned all his
jumps for the second half

253
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:30,750
of the program to up the
difficulty and boost the score.

254
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:33,916
[ANNOUNCER] A good strategy,
but not an easy one.

255
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:43,208
[MOROOKA]
Here we go.

256
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:45,708
His first planned jump
is a triple axel.

257
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:50,125
[MALE ANNOUNCER] Now, from a
spread eagle into a triple axel!

258
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:51,333
Nice height!

259
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:52,791
[MOROOKA]
Next up is his trickiest jump,

260
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:54,208
the quad Salchow.

261
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:55,583
He's landed it
less than 30 percent

262
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:57,375
of the time in competition.

263
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:00,708
[MALE ANNOUNCER]
A quad Sal!

264
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:02,875
[MOROOKA]
He nailed it!

265
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:05,958
[YURI]
Nobody else can satisfy Victor.

266
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:07,833
Only me.

267
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:09,958
Nobody else knows Victor's love.

268
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:12,500
I'm the only one.

269
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:16,625
Today, that's what
I'm skating to prove.

270
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:17,958
[MALE ANNOUNCER]
Quadruple toe loop followed by

271
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:18,875
a triple toe loop!

272
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:19,875
[MOROOKA]
Nicely done.

273
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:22,041
His jumps have been flawless.

274
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:23,875
[CHRISTOPHE]
He's different than last season.

275
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:25,208
What changed?

276
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:26,583
[MOROOKA] He's about
to complete a short program

277
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:29,666
with the highest technical
difficulty in history!

278
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:38,708
[MOROOKA]
We have just witnessed

279
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:40,541
the birth of a new Yuri Katsuki!

280
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:43,291
Today, love wins!

281
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:45,708
No one can deny that was
a perfect performance.

282
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:47,208
When the scores come in,

283
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:49,458
I'm sure we'll be looking at
a personal best for Katsuki.

284
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:50,958
The audience is
still on their feet,

285
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:52,958
and the applause in
the rink is deafening?

286
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:54,458
He used last season's
disappointment

287
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:57,625
as a springboard for an
outstand transformation.

288
00:12:57,708 --> 00:12:59,250
That was perfect!

289
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:00,375
Yuri!

290
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:02,416
The kiss and cry is that way.

291
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:05,291
[MOROOKA]
His coach certainly looks happy

292
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:07,125
with his performance.

293
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:09,416
You did well.

294
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,916
How did it feel when
you were out there?

295
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,250
Good. But mostly I was hoping

296
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:16,875
everyone else felt
good watching me.

297
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:18,750
[MOROOKA] And we have
the short program score...

298
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:21,291
...106.84!

299
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:24,125
A new personal best after
an amazing performance.

300
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:25,500
He is currently in first place!

301
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:27,583
Of course everyone
felt good watching you.

302
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:28,375
How could they not?

303
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:29,833
You were incredible today.

304
00:13:29,916 --> 00:13:32,875
I couldn't ask for
a better student.

305
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:35,625
Maybe you don't need Victor
to skate against, after all.

306
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:38,083
Focus, Leo, focus!

307
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:39,208
What's different?

308
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:41,125
He's never skated
like that before.

309
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:42,166
I wouldn't worry.

310
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,666
The free skate matters more.

311
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:47,666
Besides, Yuri isn't used
to being the one to beat.

312
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:50,458
Listen.

313
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:53,750
I know it was frustrating
to stand in Victor's shadow.

314
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,791
But now's the chance
to make your mark.

315
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:57,458

I swear, that make-up
cracks me up every time!

[GEORGI]
I am the evil witch Carabosse,

and I will cast
a curse upon her.

She will sleep,

and the only thing that will
awaken her is true love's kiss.

about the ice dancer, right?

The one he used to post
all those kissy photos with?

Well, she broke up with him

00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:48,791
and started hooking up
with some other guy.

No way. I think he's
actually crying.

this performance.

353
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:35,708
[MOROOKA]
An intense step sequence.

He executed it well, though.

355

[GEORGI] She will get
the punishment she deserves.

Fool, daring to
cross an evil witch!

so cool, you know?

to qualifying for
the Grand Prix Final.

There are no quads
in his program,

but he's earned high marks for

a hard time getting motivated.

434
00:19:33,916 --> 00:19:37,000
He's a solid skater, though, and
never goes into a major slump.

435

He doesn't like to
peak at the first event,

00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:41,166
so he starts slowly.

But, I will say, he doesn't seem
to be holding anything back

For the short program,
second is acceptable.

471
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:25,625
I won't lose to
a third-rate coach.

472
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:27,125
[MOROOKA] At the end
of the short program here

473
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:28,291
at the Cup of China,

474
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:30,708
Yuri Katsuki of Japan
is in first place.

475
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:33,000
[cheering]

476
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:34,291
That was lovely.

477
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:36,666
But our boy isn't used
to being in first place.

478
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:38,375
I hope he'll be okay.

479
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:40,666
I-I'll win with my coach Victor.

480
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,541
The power of love
is on our side!

481
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:44,125
Go, fight, win!

482
00:23:17,333 --> 00:23:19,750
[VICTOR] My Yuri is in first
going into the free skate!

483
00:23:19,833 --> 00:23:21,041
[YURI]
Victor!

484
00:23:21,125 --> 00:23:23,250
[VICTOR] His short
program was flawless, and--

485
00:23:23,333 --> 00:23:25,291
[YURI] Next time,
Seventh Skate: "China's On!

486
00:23:25,375 --> 00:23:26,791
The Grand Prix Series
Opening Event!!

487
00:23:26,875 --> 00:23:28,791
The Cup of China Free Skate!"

488
00:23:28,875 --> 00:23:29,375
[VICTOR]
Pressure?

489
00:23:29,458 --> 00:23:31,416
[YURI]
No!
