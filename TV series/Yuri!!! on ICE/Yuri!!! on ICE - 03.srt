1
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:41,083
[YURI]
Hey, guys! Yuri Katsuki here.

2
00:01:41,166 --> 00:01:42,750
The Russian Punk Yurio showed up

3
00:01:42,833 --> 00:01:45,416
to make a play for
my new coach Victor.

4
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,166
Now all hell's broken loose!

5
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:49,083
Victor is staging
an elaborate face-off

6
00:01:49,166 --> 00:01:52,833
between me and Yurio
called Hot Springs on Ice.

7
00:01:52,916 --> 00:01:57,083
If Yurio wins, Victor will go
back to Russia and be his coach.

8
00:01:57,166 --> 00:01:58,500
But if I win,

9
00:01:58,583 --> 00:02:01,500
Victor will stay here in
Japan and continue as my coach.

10
00:02:01,583 --> 00:02:05,666
So, I'm gonna give it all
the eros I've got in me!

11
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:11,041
"I Am Eros, and Eros Is Me?
Face-Off! Hot Springs on Ice."

12
00:02:11,125 --> 00:02:13,375
[VICTOR]
First, Yurio's program.

13
00:02:13,458 --> 00:02:16,416
This is "On Love: Agape."

14
00:02:26,625 --> 00:02:29,750
[VICTOR]
Agape. Unconditional love.

15
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:33,125
Like god's love or a parent's,

16
00:02:33,208 --> 00:02:37,833
infinite, self-sacrificing,
uncalculated.

17
00:02:38,541 --> 00:02:39,750
[YURI]
Aw, man.

18
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:41,833
This is a tough routine.

19
00:02:41,916 --> 00:02:44,833
Victor can pull
it off beautifully.

20
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:47,000
But can Yurio do it?

21
00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:53,250
Something like that.

22
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:54,291
Whatcha think?

23
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:55,875
Yeah. I got it, no problem.

24
00:02:55,958 --> 00:02:56,458
Huh?

25
00:02:56,541 --> 00:02:57,333
[clapping]

26
00:02:57,416 --> 00:02:59,833
Wow. Really! So beautiful!

27
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:01,833
Hey. Who said this
chick could watch?

28
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:05,041
Oh, this is Yuko, one of
the staff here at the ice rink.

29
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:07,208
I shouldn't have
interrupted your practice,

30
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:09,541
but it was just so wonderful.

31
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:10,416
Sorry.

32
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,500
[gasps]

33
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:14,625
This one's yours,
Yuri, so pay attention!

34
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:16,875
Yeah. Right!

35
00:03:16,958 --> 00:03:19,083
[YURI] A program
choreographed just for me

36
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:22,250
by Victor himself!

37
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:24,666
[VICTOR]
This is "On Love: Eros"

38
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,291
--[YUKO] Guh!!
--[YURI] Ahh!

39
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:33,916
[VICTOR]
Eros. Sexual love.

40
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,500
Pleasure layered upon pleasure

41
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:38,291
until you're
drowning in ecstasy.

42
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:40,791
[YURI]
He's... like sex on ice.

43
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:42,333
There's so much
eros in this routine,

44
00:03:42,416 --> 00:03:45,500
I think it might impregnate me!

45
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,583
[YURI]
No way!

46
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:50,750
I can't skate like that!

47
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:52,583
[VICTOR]
Well?

48
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:54,041
What do you think?

49
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:57,333
Oh, I... well, uh...
It was very "eros"!

50
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:58,833
I know, right?

51
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:01,666
Now, composition--which quads
do you think you can land?

52
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,125
[YURI]
Well, I can do the toe loop.

53
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:04,416
And the Salchow in practice,

54
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,666
but I've never landed
it in competition.

55
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,625
Uh... Uh!

56
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:10,375
But maybe I should
still give it a shot?

57
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,083
What do you think?

58
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:14,458
Just stick to practicing
your fundamentals for now.

59
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:15,875
I'll work with Yurio first.

60
00:04:15,958 --> 00:04:17,166
[YURI]
Huh?

61
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,375
I have no intention
of wasting the day trying

62
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,458
to teach you
something you can't do.

63
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:23,291
How many times have you choked
during a competition, Yuri?

64
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:25,583
You've shown
you have the skill to win.

65
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:27,083
Why can't you?

66
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:31,291
Probably... 'cause I don't have
a whole lot of confidence.

67
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:32,625
That's right.

68
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:34,666
What I want to do is help
you find that confidence

69
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:38,166
and embrace it.

70
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:41,750
Unleash the eros within you.

71
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:44,583
Maybe no one's seen it before,
but I know it's there.

72
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:46,166
Smoldering deep down inside you,

73
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:48,583
waiting for its
chance to come out.

74
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:50,416
Can you show it to me?

75
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,500
Can you do that?

76
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:52,625
You're supposed
to be teaching me

77
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:54,166
and not chatting with the piggy!

78
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,375
Yeah.

79
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:56,208
Well, anyway.

80
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:57,125
[YURI]
Huh?

81
00:04:57,208 --> 00:04:58,166
[VICTOR]
While you're training,

82
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:59,625
I also expect
you to be thinking.

83
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:02,166
I want to know
what eros is to you.

84
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:04,083
[YURI]
Yeah. Sure. No problem.

85
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:05,916
I can do that.

86
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,500
[AXEL]
Oh...

87
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:10,083
[LUTZ] I still can't believe we
got a show this big in Hasetsu!

88
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:11,916
[LOOP] I bet a million
people will show!

89
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,125
And we know what
they're gonna see, don't we?

90
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:15,791
Yuri kicking butt!

91
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:18,375
Go, Yuri, go!

92
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:19,625
Really?

93
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:20,875
You were stuck
with basic training

94
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:22,500
because you don't get "eros"?

95
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:23,916
[YURI]
Yeah.

96
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,416
[NISHIGORI sighs] You shoulda
just made something up.

97
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,916
I bet Victor hasn't thought
about it much either.

98
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,250
Yeah, well, he's a skating god,

99
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:33,583
so he can get away
with that sort of thing.

100
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,666
You know, thinking
about the program,

101
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:39,125
I can actually imagine
a story it might be telling.

102
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:42,291
A handsome, charming
playboy comes to town.

103
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:44,666
The women fall for
him left and right.

104
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:47,958
He decides to pursue the most
beautiful one of them all.

105
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:50,291
But she turns him away.

106
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:52,583
Undeterred, the man
continues his pursuit

107
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:55,583
with gifts and
flattery and promises.

108
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:58,041
Until finally, she gives in.

109
00:05:58,125 --> 00:06:01,166
But, having got what he wanted,
the man loses interest

110
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,875
and moves on to the next town.

111
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:06,750
Oh, how sexy! Take me now!

112
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:09,666
Sorry. Good story and all, but
it just doesn't sound like you.

113
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,208
I know!

114
00:06:11,291 --> 00:06:14,541
Anyone who sees it will wish
Victor was the one skating it.

115
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:16,833
Well, y'know,
you looked kinda sexy

116
00:06:16,916 --> 00:06:18,291
in that video
where you copied him.

117
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:20,125
[YURI]
I can't just keep copying him!

118
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:22,666
I mean, I'll never get
better than him that way.

119
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:23,875
Wait a sec.

120
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:26,375
You think you can be
better than him someday?

121
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:28,916
Huh? Oh! No! Of course not!

122
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,208
Let's get real, here.

123
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:31,708
How many dates
have you had?

124
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:34,000
You do know he's the
hottest skater in the world?

125
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:36,333
[laughs]

126
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:38,583
[VICTOR]
Stop, stop!

127
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:39,750
Hmm.

128
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:41,625
Something just doesn't
feel right, here.

129
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:43,750
But I'm doing
it like you showed me!

130
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:44,875
[VICTOR]
Hmm...

131
00:06:44,958 --> 00:06:46,208
The way you're
performing it now,

132
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:48,625
your hunger for
victory is too obvious.

133
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:49,666
You aren't projecting

134
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:52,541
the essential purity
that is "agape."

135
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:53,958
It's good to have confidence.

136
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:57,041
But in this program, it
shouldn't be front and center.

137
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,041
Yeah?

138
00:06:58,125 --> 00:06:59,375
Far as I can tell,
when you skate,

139
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:01,875
confidence is always
"front and center."

140
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:04,541
So how about you tell me
what agape means to you?

141
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:06,041
It's an emotion,

142
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:08,208
so why waste time trying to
put it into words, you know?

143
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:09,458
Right? When you skate,

144
00:07:09,541 --> 00:07:11,541
it's about what
you feel, not what you think.

145
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:14,083
Haven't you figured
that out yet?

146
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:16,291
Now, on to the temple!

147
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:17,791
[PLISETSKY]
The temple?

148
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:23,083
<i>Nyet</i> ! Ow! Ow!

149
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,041
[sighs]

150
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:28,875
[YURI]
Damn it.

151
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:31,375
I'm a man. I'm 23.

152
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:36,000
I should be able to project
some semblance of sexuality!

153
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:37,583
Quick favor?

154
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:40,708
I need a photo of myself in the
bath so I can post it online.

155
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:45,500
Sorry, we don't let people
take pictures in the bath.

156
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:47,166
[VICTOR]
Really?

157
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,791
[YURI]
It's no use.

158
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:53,291
I'm not any closer to
figuring out what eros is.

159
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:55,500
Eros, eros.

160
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:57,166
Something that makes
you lose the ability

161
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:59,208

00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:29,833
Who can win against that?

321
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:35,750
[MOROOKA]
Here come the quads

322
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:37,666
he previously wasn't
allowed to perform.

323
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:41,000
Daring to put them in the
second half of the program!

324
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:43,583
A quadruple Salchow,
followed by a triple toe loop.

325
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:46,125
That's one down and one to go!

326
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:52,208
[MOROOKA] And here comes
his final jump of the program.

327
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:54,166
a quadruple toe loop.

328
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:55,500
And he nails it!

329
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:57,125
He landed every single jump.

330
00:15:57,208 --> 00:16:00,041
It's hard to believe that
he's only 15 years old!

331
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:09,916
[PLISETSKY]
Sorry, Grandpa.

332
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,500
I'm too busy concentrating
on the program.

333
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:14,791
I cannot feel the agape.

334
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:19,333
[MOROOKA] His signature
move--the combination spin.

335
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:20,833
[PLISETSKY]
Damn it.

336

[PLISETSKY]
Just end already.

337
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:34,625
[MOROOKA]
Wow! A masterful performance!

338
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:37,208
We have a lot to look
forward to this season!

339
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:38,416
[PLISETSKY]
It wasn't enough.

340
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,416
I'm better than this.

341
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,916
[VICTOR]
Yurio!

342
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,458
That was the best performance
I've seen from you so far!

343
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:45,416
Go on, take a bow!

344
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,750

[YURI]
That was amazing.

348
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:56,458
He'll definitely rank among
the top senior division skaters.

349
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:58,000
Oh, God.

350
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:01,333
If I lose, that means Victor
will go with him back to Russia.

351
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:02,791
That can't happen.

352
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:03,958
I have to win.

353
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:05,291
I have to. I have to.

354
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:07,458
[VICTOR]
Yuri.

Ready? You're up.

356
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:15,500
[YURI]
Uh. Yes. I'm ready.

357
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:16,666
I'm going to skate
with everything

358

I have out there today.

359
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:21,958
I'll be the tastiest
pork cutlet bowl ever.

360
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,500
So watch, won't you?

361
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:28,166
Of course I will.
I love pork cutlet bowls.

362
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:29,916
Introducing our next skater.

Representing Japan.

364
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:34,208
A late bloomer who's
become a rising star.

365
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:37,500
Yuri Katsuki!

[RANDOM FEMALE FAN D]
Good luck, Yuri!

367
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:41,833
[MOROOKA] He will be
skating to "On Love: Eros."

368
00:17:41,916 --> 00:17:43,666
He struggled with
how to express eros,

369
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:46,125
but found inspiration
thinking of his favorite dish,

370
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:47,625
a pork cutlet bowl.

371
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:50,000
[AUDIENCE whispering]

372
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:52,250
[MINAKO] After all
the work we did last night,

373
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:55,625
that is no ordinary
pork cutlet bowl.

374
00:17:56,625 --> 00:17:58,666
["On Love: Eros" plays]

375
00:17:58,750 --> 00:17:59,791
[YURI]
At first I didn't know

376
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:02,166
who I was dancing for.

377
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:04,666
But now I do.

378
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:05,875
[whistles]

379
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:42,708
[MOROOKA] That step
sequence was pure seduction.

380
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:45,791
I find it hard to believe he's
imagining a pork cutlet bowl.

381
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:47,291
[MINAKO]
Good!

382
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:50,166
Step sequences and spins have
always been your strength.

383
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:53,500
I want you to teach me
how to move like a woman.

384
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:54,541
Huh?

385
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:55,875
[YURI]
I can't be the playboy.

386
00:18:55,958 --> 00:18:57,291
It's not me.

387
00:18:57,375 --> 00:19:00,375
I have to be the beautiful woman
who seduces the playboy.

388
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:02,000
I won't change any moves.

389
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:04,125
I'll just change the <i>way</i> I move.

390
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:05,583
I think that will be
a better expression

391
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:07,500
of what I really feel.

392
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:08,708
[MINAKO]
At first I didn't get why

393
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:10,250
he was so intent on that.

394
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:12,083
But I see it now.

395
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:14,708
He's never skated
like this before.

396
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:21,166
[MOROOKA] Now, we have a spread
eagle right into a triple axel.

397
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:23,000
[NISHIGORI]
Man, this program is tough.

398
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:24,458
I wonder if he's
going to regret saving

399
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:26,791
all the jumps for
the second half.

400
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:31,291
[MOROOKA]
Whoops!

401
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:32,708
He stepped out of
that quadruple Sal.

402
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:34,750
He did stay on his feet,
but his hand touched the ice.

403
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:36,375
[PLISETSKY]
Yeah, no surprise there.

404
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:37,458
[YURI]
Don't panic!

405
00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:39,166
Just stay in control.

406
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:41,916
One mistake doesn't
mean I've lost.

407
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,041
I'm better than any
other woman out there.

408
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:47,166
And now it's time
to show him why.

409
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:49,416
[MOROOKA] A quadruple toe loop
followed by a triple toe loop!

410
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,750
Absolute perfection!

411
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:53,916
[NISHIGORI] A quad-triple
combo at the very end?

Is he insane?

413
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:57,333

Welcome back, Yuri!

417

It's not "welcome back."

That was a Yuri
we've never seen before.

Nobody could look away.

will be one hell of a season.

something I want to ask you.

Okay. Sure.

427
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,458
What was with that
pathetic triple axel out of

428
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:43,083
the spread eagle? And I guess
your quad Salchow is better,

but obviously Yurio didn't

your secret practice sessions.
