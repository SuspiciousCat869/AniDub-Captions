Hey there!

00:01:40,458 --> 00:01:41,875
Yuri Katsuki here.

3
00:01:41,958 --> 00:01:44,208
I'm getting ready for my first
competition of the season,

4
00:01:44,291 --> 00:01:47,666
the Chu-Shikoku-Kyushu
Regional Championship.

5
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:49,625
There are four of us in
the senior men's division,

6
00:01:49,708 --> 00:01:52,500
and I'm the oldest...
by a lot.

00:01:52,583 --> 00:01:55,250

[EVENT STAFF A] Skater
Yuri Katsuki, you're up first.

00:01:57,166 --> 00:01:59,166
[YURI]
No, not again.

10
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:00,500
Just like the last Nationals.

11
00:02:00,583 --> 00:02:03,208
I have the worst luck
with this sort of thing.

12
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:04,625
I can't believe
I got to watch you

13
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:06,708
draw your spot two
years in a row!

14
00:02:06,791 --> 00:02:08,250
Lucky me!

15
00:02:09,916 --> 00:02:11,291
And you're?

16
00:02:11,375 --> 00:02:12,416
[KENJIRO] Wait a sec, you
mean you don't remember me?

17
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,166
My heart just broke a little!

18
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:16,833
Kenjiro Minami, right here!

19
00:02:16,916 --> 00:02:17,875
[YURI]
Who's he again?

20
00:02:17,958 --> 00:02:20,416
Woo-hoo!

No pressure.

We've timed the season, so he
peaks at the Grand Prix Final.

26
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,416
So today he can take it easy.

His focus will be on
scoring his personal best.

28

I must've told
you a million times,

29
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,708
but in last year's Nationals,
I bombed everything.

30
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:39,500
I did so incredibly bad,
they thought I was injured,

31
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:40,708
but there was nothing
physically wrong.

32
00:02:40,791 --> 00:02:41,583
Do you understand?

33
00:02:41,666 --> 00:02:42,625
Despite being a top contender,

34
00:02:42,708 --> 00:02:43,666
I lost because
I was mentally weak.

35
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:44,500
But no pressure, right?

36
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:45,750
[VICTOR]
Wow.

37
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:48,416
[YURI] I haven't been
in a single competition

38
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,125
since last year's Nationals.

Look, even Makka's
here to cheer for you!

40
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:53,666
[YURI]
I've been training with Victor

41
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:54,708
for a while now.

42
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:56,000
[VICTOR]
Such a grumpy pants!

43
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:57,125
[YURI]
But honestly,

44
00:02:57,208 --> 00:02:59,416
I'm still not all
that sure of myself.

45
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,125
This is the first test
I'll have to figure out

46
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:04,000
if I'm in good enough shape
for the Grand Prix series.

47
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:06,541
I need to concentrate on myself,
not the other skaters.

48
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:07,916
Ahhh...

49
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,666
[YURI] I can feel
somebody staring at me.

50
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:11,750
[KANAKO] Remember
how focused you were

51
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:13,541
at the Nationals last season?

52
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:16,583
Now's not the time
to get distracted!

Wow.

Quite a turn-out, huh?

56

Been like this since
the public practice earlier.

[MINAKO]
I hope Yuri's okay.

He's usually a mess
before competitions. Oh!

59
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:30,541
You have any idea
where Victor is?

60
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:32,500
It's about to start,
and I can't find him.

Sorry, were you waiting?

00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:35,583
[YURI] What did you
change your clothes for?

63
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:37,125
Today is my debut as a coach,

64
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:39,041
so I thought I should
dress for the occasion.

more than the skaters

As your coach,

70
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,083
it's my duty send you out
there feeling confident.

71

truly believe that you... Uh.

[VICTOR] Seduce me with
everything you have.

85

If your performance
can enthrall me,

86
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:41,708
then you can bring the
whole audience to their knees.

That's what I say
in practice, right?

Right.

Come on, people,

97
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:23,833
this is a pretty
lukewarm response.

98
00:05:23,916 --> 00:05:25,250

was way more into it

this step sequence.

[VICTOR]
All right!

00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:39,875
Imagine the juiciness of the
pork, the softness of the egg.

[YURI]
That's right.

eagle into a triple axel.

I was drawn to you

because of the way
you move to the music.

115
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:11,916
Like the song's
already inside you

116

and you're using your
body to release it.

117
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,041
That's perfect.

118
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:17,291
[YURI]
The last jump is a combination

119
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:19,958
and worth the most points.

120

Crap, made it a double.

122
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,375
This is the last element.

123
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:33,791
The conclusion to
the lovers' story.

Wait, how does it go, again?

Right, the temptress casts
aside the man she seduced

What does Victor think?

134
00:06:58,125 --> 00:06:59,416
The first half was great,

135
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,250
but then you became so
focused on landing the jumps

136
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:02,625
that your
performance got sloppy.

137
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:04,291
I don't really like
that sort of thing.

138
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:05,125
[YURI]
Right.

139
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:06,208
Why's he getting yelled at?

140
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:08,250
He had the audience
panting for him.

141
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:10,958
[NISHIGORI] Hm. He could be
looking at a personal best.

142
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:13,375
[ANNOUNCER] And now,
the scores for Yuri Katsuki.

143
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:16,708
Short program score: 94.36.

144
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:18,708
He is currently in first place.

145
00:07:18,791 --> 00:07:21,500
That's almost ten points higher
than his previous best! Amazing!

146
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:23,541
Well, this won't
be an official record,

147
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:27,375
but that score is among
the top ten in the world!

148
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:28,750
[VICTOR]
Hm.

149
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:30,666
I thought you might be able
to get into the hundreds

150
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,250
since you weren't
under pressure.

151
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:34,750
Right, I mean you've broken
the world record multiple times

152
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:37,750
with scores in the hundreds,
so it must be easy.

153
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:41,125
[VICTOR] Oh, by the way,
about the free skate tomorrow.

154
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:43,916
Let's lower the jump difficulty
and focus on performance.

155

Huh?

156

[VICTOR]
Now, now, you know

157
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:47,041
you've never landed
them all in practice.

158

Victor.

159
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:49,166
Early on in the season,

160
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,291
it makes sense to lower
your program's difficulty.

00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:52,875
Then you can adjust
as you go along

162
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:56,375
and time it to reach your
peak at the Grand Prix Final.

163
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:59,125
You wouldn't disobey
your coach, would you?

164
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:00,583
[MAKKACHIN barks]

165
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:03,750
[KENJIRO]
Incredible!

166
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:06,125
Yuri was obviously a
temptress who uses her wiles

167
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:09,500
to seduce and then to betray in
the most beautiful way possible!

168
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:11,041
You saw it, right, Kanako?

169
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:12,625
That triple axel!

170
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:15,083
That was a GOE of
3,000,000 points, easy!

171
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:16,166
[KANAKO]
Yeah.

172
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:17,708
I hope your triple axel
goes that well.

173
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:19,416
It's been inconsistent.

174
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,166
I want Yuri to be
impressed with my program,

175
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,625
so I have to nail it.

176
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:24,708
How do you feel looking
ahead to the free skate?

177
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:26,708
Uh, I'm hoping I'll be able to--

178
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:29,458
Yuri's focus will be on
flawless execution tomorrow.

179
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:30,458
Did you see that?

180
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:32,166
I managed to land
the triple axel.

181
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,666
I'd say that was easily
your best performance yet!

182
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,125
Hey! Did you see it?

183
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:37,958
My "Lohengrin" performance?

184
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:40,416
I was being interviewed,
so I missed it. Sorry.

185
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:44,458
[gasps, whimpers]

186
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:45,916
I even had a
special costume made.

187
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,083
It's similar to the one

188
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:49,375
from your famous
"Lohengrin" program?

189
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:51,083
A costume from my shameful past.

190
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:52,583
[KENJIRO gasps]

191
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:54,916
An amazing skater like you
doesn't have a shameful past!

192
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,250
When you make fun of yourself,
you're also making fun of me

193
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:59,000
for looking up to
you all this time.

194
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:01,958
Tomorrow, I'm gonna give
it everything I've got!

195
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,333
If you're the skater
I think you are, so will you!

196
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:06,333
If you slack off,
I won't forgive you!

197
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:07,833
Whoa!

198
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:09,583
It looks like Minami's throwing
down the gauntlet, folks!

199
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:11,208
Let's not forget,
at last year's Nationals,

200
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:13,791
he finished ahead
of skater Katsuki.

201
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:15,916
[YURI]
Oh, right. I remember now.

202
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,166
He's the guy who won last
year after I self-destructed.

203
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:21,250
Aw, crap.

204
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:32,458
The free skate program will
begin soon here in Okayama.

205
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:35,083
Everyone is eager to see
who today's champion will be.

206
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:38,916
All eyes are on Yuri Katsuki
and his coach Victor Nikiforov.

207
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,250
Hi!

208
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:41,125
[MOROOKA] Katsuki ended
yesterday's short program

209
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:42,625
in the lead by a wide margin,

210
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:46,000
scoring a personal best of
ninety-four point three six.

211
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:49,375
In his free skate today,
he will attempt three quads.

212
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:52,500
[YURI] Victor and I decided
to lower the difficulty

213
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:54,583
and only do one quad, but--

214
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:55,416
[KENJIRO]
Yuri's doing a quad.

215
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,000
I'm gonna try one too!

216
00:09:57,083 --> 00:10:00,333
Seriously? But you've never
even landed one in practice.

217
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:01,250
[HIKARU]
Maybe I'll try it.

218
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:02,625
[YUTO]
Yeah, me too!

219
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,625
[ANNOUNCER]
Ladies and gentlemen,

220
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:07,333
this is the senior men's
free skate program.

221
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:10,416
Will the competitors please
take the ice for your warm-up?

222
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,833
You have six minutes.

223
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:13,291
Thank you.

224
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:17,666
[VICTOR]
Hm...

225
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,041
[YURI]
I can't get distracted.

226
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:21,333
I need to focus
on myself right now.

227
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:22,083
Yuri.

228
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:23,125
[YURI]
Huh?

229
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:24,291
If you don't have the strength

230
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:26,083
to motivate someone
who looks up to you,

231
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:29,000
how can you find the strength
to motivate yourself?

232
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:31,041
I'm disappointed in you.

233
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:38,333
[YURI] Can we talk about
what you just did

234
00:10:38,416 --> 00:10:40,625
to my motivation for a second?

Oh, you're nervous.

Good luck out there, Minami!

doesn't have a shameful past!

When you make fun of yourself,
you're also making fun of me

for looking up
to you all this time.

[YURI]
The crowd's into it already.

251
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:39,083
He must be popular.

252
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:41,416
[KENJIRO]
First, a triple axel.

253
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:49,708
[YURI]
All right, one jump down.

254
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:54,583
[KENJIRO]
And now, a quadruple toe loop.

255
00:11:58,208 --> 00:12:01,750
[YURI] Wow. Is he going
to land all of them?

256
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:09,416
[YURI]
He's good.

257
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,166
But still really inconsistent.

258
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:15,625
It reminds me of
the skater I used to be.

259
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:18,500
It's hard to take your
eyes off him, though.

260
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:27,958
[YURI]
He's got the skill set

261
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:29,791
to be a real competitor.

262
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:31,750
There's no doubting that.

[FANGIRLS cheering]

I can tell by their cheers--

265
00:13:40,416 --> 00:13:43,166
[YURI] That you are
the star on the stage.

[ANNOUNCER] Now the
scores for Kenjiro Minami.

His free skate program
score is 152.14.

270
00:13:58,291 --> 00:13:59,083
That makes his total score...

00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:01,833
Yeah! A new personal best score!

Way to go.

Keep it up, and it'll
be a personal best.

Good. I think this
costume was the right choice.

287
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:53,166
You look absolutely stunning.

288
00:14:55,416 --> 00:14:57,333
Your lips are a little chapped.

00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:10,583
[laughs]

290
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:13,791
I heard Victor wanted
him to cut it down

291
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:14,916
to one quad this time,

292
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,375
but I wonder if that's
going to happen.

293
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:19,208
Yeah, Yuri's a stubborn ass
when he wants to be.

294
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:22,000
Go, Yuri! Good luck!

295
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:23,333
In this first public performance

296
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:25,083
of Katsuki's free program,
he will be skating

297
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:28,291
to an original composition
inspired by his skating career.

298
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:30,500
It is titled "Yuri on Ice."

299
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:33,375
The program was choreographed
by Victor Nikiforov.

300
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:41,500
["Yuri on Ice" plays]

301
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
[VICTOR] The opening of the
program expresses the time

302
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:50,708
in Yuri's career when he felt
like he was fighting alone.

303
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:54,541
The first jump is a
quad-triple combination.

304
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:55,750
It should be fine.

305
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:58,291
He's landed it consistently
during practice.

306
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:03,583
[gasps]

307
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:05,291
[KENJIRO]
He nailed it!

308
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:08,416
[VICTOR] He changed
the triple to a double.

309
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:12,083
Why is he changing
the jump elements?

310
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:16,333
Is he going to add a
triple in the second half?

311
00:16:16,416 --> 00:16:20,833
Either that, or he's going
back to attempting three quads.

312
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:23,333
Completely ignoring the
fact that I told him to focus

313
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:28,375
on refining the program instead
of getting distracted by jumps.

314
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:33,666
[VICTOR]
You look too stiff out there!

315
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:34,875
This is the part that expresses

316
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:37,500
when I showed up to
be your coach, right?

317
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:38,666
That look doesn't make it seem

318
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:41,166
like you were
very happy about it.

319
00:16:47,791 --> 00:16:49,416
[VICTOR]
A triple Salchow.

320
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:51,333
[VICTOR]
No, a quad.

321
00:16:51,416 --> 00:16:53,125
He stepped out of the landing.

322
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,000
[VICTOR] I was right--
he did revert the program

323
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:05,166
to having three quads.

324
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:07,375
Shake off that last one.

325
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:08,750
Good.

326
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:16,416
[VICTOR]
A triple loop.

327
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,458
That was perfect.

328
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:21,583
[VICTOR]
And now this is Yuri realizing

329
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:23,583
something like love.

330
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:27,833
The second half is coming up,
and he already looks tired.

331
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,750
[VICTOR]
An outside spread eagle.

332
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:34,333
[VICTOR]
Then an Ina Bauer.

333
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:35,875
That's right.

334
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:39,958
Make it so beautiful that no one
can take their eyes off you.

335
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:42,583
[VICTOR]
A triple axel.

336
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:44,250
Good, he hung in there.

337
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:52,166
[VICTOR]
Next up, a triple flip.

338
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:57,958
[VICTOR] He's not nailing
all of his jumps,

339
00:17:58,041 --> 00:18:00,291
but he's still got
the audience stirred up.

340
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:03,875
Because of the way his
body moves to the music.

341
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:08,333
[AUDIENCE claps]

342
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:10,375
So close!

343
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:13,458
[VICTOR] He's being too
impatient out there.

344
00:18:13,541 --> 00:18:18,791
But, that's why it is
impossible to look away.

345
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:54,708
[VICTOR]
Yuri!

346
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:57,166
I told you to make the last
jump a triple for the points!

347
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:59,500
[VICTOR chuckles]

348
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:01,375
[VICTOR] Most skaters
wouldn't rebel against

349
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:03,958
their coach like he has today.

350
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:06,833
I wonder who he takes after.

351
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:11,708
[AUDIENCE claps]

352
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:15,916
[VICTOR]
I guess that would be me.

00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:21,041
[AUDIENCE cheers]

354
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:23,291
[VICTOR] Yakov would have
taken his head off for that,

355
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:25,041
and I'm tempted
to do it too, but--

356
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:26,208
Beautiful!

357
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:27,625
That's a performance
he can be proud of!

358

Watch the nosebleed!

363
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,875
[ANNOUNCER]
Now the scores for Yuri Katsuki.

364
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:02,375
His free skate program
score is 165.20,

365
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:04,166
which makes his total score...

366
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:06,500
It's amazing you got such
a high score after running

367
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:08,583
your face into a wall, but
thanks for proving me right

about your ability
to get a solid PCS.

369
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:14,125
I know you'll do
better next time.

370
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:15,250
[KENJIRO]
Yuri!

371
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:17,166
You totally beat me.

372
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,791
But I won't give up, Yuri.

373
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:21,666
I want to face you in the
Grand Prix series someday.

374
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:23,833
I hope you won't quit
before I get to!

375
00:20:23,916 --> 00:20:26,333
There's one more thing.
Can I have your autograph?

376
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:27,041
Yeah, me too!

377
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:28,166
How about a photo?

378
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:31,208
Oh, Yuri! I am so proud of you!

379
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:32,583
You didn't slack off,

380
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:34,041
even though you were skating
against a bunch of kids!

381
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:35,333
Still, you scared
the crap outta me

382
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:37,458
when you slammed
your face into that wall!

383
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:39,583
Yeah. I'm sorry.

384
00:20:39,666 --> 00:20:41,458
Honestly, I began
the program pretty stiff

385
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:43,708
because I was so
desperate not to lose.

386
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:47,916
But somehow... well...
I guess I started having fun.

387
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,916
It's all kind of a blur.

388
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,291
Huh?

389
00:20:56,083 --> 00:20:57,416
[YURI]
It's crazy.

390
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:01,041
I actually had fun skating
in a competition.

391
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:05,791
I don't think...
that's ever happened before.

392

[PLISETSKY grunts]

Geh!

394
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:17,625
That's quite a temper tantrum.

395
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:20,750
You saw the photo of Victor and
the Japanese Yuri, didn't you?

396
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:22,750
Shut your mouth, you hag!

397
00:21:23,791 --> 00:21:26,333
[MOROOKA] Next, we have
recent champion, Yuri Katsuki,

398
00:21:26,416 --> 00:21:27,708
who many believe
will be the next leader

399
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:29,541
of men's singles in Japan.

400
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:31,250
Katsuki, if you will.

401
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:35,250
Um, please, if you'll show
us your theme for this year.

402
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:36,875
We're dying to know.

403
00:21:39,708 --> 00:21:41,791
I struggled to find a
theme for this Grand Prix.

404
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:43,250
It was hard, but in the end.

405
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:45,333
I chose "love."

406
00:21:45,416 --> 00:21:46,958
There have been so many
people who have helped me

407
00:21:47,041 --> 00:21:49,166
in my competitive
skating career.

408
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:52,583
Yet somehow, I'd never thought
of it as "love" until now.

409
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:54,125
I was lucky to have
people supporting me,

410
00:21:54,208 --> 00:21:56,958
but I had a hard time
accepting that support.

411
00:21:57,041 --> 00:21:59,916
So I always felt like
I was fighting alone.

412
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,083
But since Victor came into
my life and became my coach.

413
00:22:03,166 --> 00:22:05,583
I've started seeing
things differently.

414
00:22:05,666 --> 00:22:09,000
This "love" isn't something
as clear-cut as romantic love.

415
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:10,833
It's more of an abstract
feeling that encompasses

416
00:22:10,916 --> 00:22:14,500
my relationships with Victor,
my family, and my hometown.

417
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,083
It took a long time,

418
00:22:16,166 --> 00:22:19,750
but I finally realized that I'm
surrounded by love every day.

419
00:22:19,833 --> 00:22:21,333
For the first time,

420
00:22:21,416 --> 00:22:24,458
there's somebody I want to hold
on to--that person is Victor.

421
00:22:24,541 --> 00:22:26,875
I don't really have
a name for that emotion.

422
00:22:26,958 --> 00:22:29,958
But I've decided
to call it love.

423
00:22:30,041 --> 00:22:31,250
It's changed me.

424
00:22:31,333 --> 00:22:32,791
I'm stronger now.

425
00:22:32,875 --> 00:22:35,166
And I'll prove it
at the Grand Prix Final.

00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:37,208
With a gold medal!

427

that's what we get?
