Today we'll see performances

2
00:00:09,458 --> 00:00:11,541
from the six skaters
who survived the brutal

3
00:00:11,625 --> 00:00:14,333
Grand Prix Series to vie
for the coveted title.

4
00:00:14,416 --> 00:00:15,666
And here they are:

5
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,458
[NAOHIKO] In sixth place,
and the last to qualify,

6
00:00:17,541 --> 00:00:20,958
Yuri Katsuki, seeking to redeem
himself in his second Final.

7
00:00:21,041 --> 00:00:22,916
With Victor Nikiforov
as his coach,

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,791
he will try to prove
the power of love

9
00:00:24,875 --> 00:00:26,583
by bringing home the gold medal.

10
00:00:26,666 --> 00:00:28,250
Phichit Chulanont finished fifth

11
00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:29,958
in the Grand Prix
Series after becoming

12
00:00:30,041 --> 00:00:32,875
the first Thai skater to win
gold at the Cup of China.

13
00:00:32,958 --> 00:00:35,208
In his first Final,
he's hoping to rewrite history

14
00:00:35,291 --> 00:00:37,000
for Southeast Asian
figure skating.

15
00:00:37,083 --> 00:00:39,458
Yuri Plisetsky came
in fourth in the series.

16
00:00:39,541 --> 00:00:42,583
Last year's junior champion,
this is his senior debut.

17
00:00:42,666 --> 00:00:44,458
He has performed
brilliantly so far,

18
00:00:44,541 --> 00:00:46,750
placing second in both
qualifying events.

19
00:00:46,833 --> 00:00:49,208
As the youngest skater at
this Final, he seeks to defend

20
00:00:49,291 --> 00:00:52,125
Russia's prestige by
securing his first victory.

21
00:00:52,208 --> 00:00:54,625
In third is Christophe
Giacometti of Switzerland.

22
00:00:54,708 --> 00:00:57,000
His mature skating and
giant quadruple Lutz

23
00:00:57,083 --> 00:00:59,041
have enthralled
skating fans worldwide.

24
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:02,500
He'll be aiming for
his first GP Final gold.

25
00:01:02,583 --> 00:01:04,416
Coming in second
is Otabek Altin,

26
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,750
Kazakhstan's hero.

27
00:01:05,833 --> 00:01:08,000
He won bronze at the World
Championship last season

28
00:01:08,083 --> 00:01:11,000
and claimed his first GP
victory in the NHK Trophy.

29
00:01:11,083 --> 00:01:14,416
His qualification for the Final
this year is another upset.

30
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,833
Finishing first in the
series is Jean-Jacques Leroy,

31
00:01:16,916 --> 00:01:18,750
the man to beat
and the only qualifier

32
00:01:18,833 --> 00:01:20,291
to win both his events.

33
00:01:20,375 --> 00:01:23,541
In his short program and his
free skate, he jumped six quads.

34
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:26,458
JJ sets a high bar for
his fellow competitors.

35
00:01:26,541 --> 00:01:28,375
Now the moment they've
all been waiting for:

36
00:01:28,458 --> 00:01:31,958
the final round is about
to begin here in Barcelona.

And now, with the warm-up over,


40
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:15,291
Yuri Katsuki is the last
skater remaining on the ice.


41

Yuri.

42
00:03:18,416 --> 00:03:19,541
Yes?

His coach clasps his hand,

45
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:26,458
displaying the matching
rings that they wear.

46
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:28,166
Huh? What's with
the matching rings?

47
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,916
--Yuri! Good luck!
--[MICHELE] Good idea!

48
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,166
I wish you and I
had rings like that.

49
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,875
Here I go.

[ANNOUNCER 11A]
On the ice...

51
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:48,166
[MOROOKA] A roaring crowd
greets him as he takes the ice.

52
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,500
--Go, Yuri!
--[MOROOKA] Yuri Katsuki!

53
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:50,791
--Good luck out there!
--[MOROOKA] Yuri Katsuki!

54
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:52,250
You can do it, Yuri!

55
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:53,625
[MOROOKA] It's hard not to
wonder what's going through

Katsuki's head as he
begins his short program

57
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:58,916
a year after taking
last place in the Final.

58
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:04,791
["On Love: Eros" plays]

59
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:08,750
[MOROOKA] He is skating
to "On Love: Eros."

60
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:15,083
[MOROOKA] Now, Oda, we've
heard that he's changed

61
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:17,416
his jump composition
in this program.

62
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,791
[NOBUNARI] Yes, he changed
it after the Rostelecom Cup

63
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:21,541
for a higher base score.

64
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:26,208
[YURI] Even if I top my personal
best again, I can't beat JJ.

65
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:28,708
His program has 5.22
points on mine

66
00:04:28,791 --> 00:04:32,500
in the jumps' base value alone.
I have to take a risk.

67
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:34,166
You want to switch
it to a quad flip

68
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,541
in your short program?
That's chancy.

69
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:39,250
You've barely even landed that
jump cleanly in practice.

70
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:43,250
[YURI] Mm-hm. But I still have
time to improve the execution.

71
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:45,375
I can't afford complacency,
and finding out

72
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:47,583
how far I can push myself
will help motivate me

73
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:49,416
to keep fighting
through the Final.

74
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,166
Don't you wanna
see it, Victor?

75
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,958
Don't you want to see
me land a quad flip

76
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:55,041
with a plus three GOE?

77
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:55,875
I do!

78
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:56,875
Yeah?

79
00:04:58,333 --> 00:05:00,333
[YURI] Since then, I've focused
a lot of practice time

80
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:04,291
on the quad flip, but my
success rate still isn't high.

81
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:06,125
I've decided to
go for it, though.

82
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:07,250
[VICTOR]
Yuri's grown.

83
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:09,708
He doesn't doubt
his decisions anymore.

84
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:11,666
But that doesn't change
the fact that my heart

85
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,833
is about to explode.

86
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:14,666
[NOBUNARI]
A triple axel.

87
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:15,833
Ha!

88
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:17,375
[NOBUNARI]
That jump has a difficult entry,

89
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:19,250
so it will get higher marks.

90
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:23,083
[MOROOKA] Next up is a
quadruple jump combination.

91
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,708
[NOBUNARI]
Quadruple Salchow,

92
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:27,791
followed by a triple toe loop.

--[MOROOKA] Another success!

courses through the body,

95
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:35,791
down to the toes,
and is released!

96
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:38,083
[MOROOKA] Now, the highly
anticipated quad flip.

97
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:40,250
[VICTOR]
Good, just use that speed to...

98
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:44,166
[NOBUNARI] A quadruple flip,
but one hand on the ice.

99
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,916
[MOROOKA] That spin received
a level four rating

100
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,250
--again this season.
--That was so close, Yuri!

101
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:51,166
That flip had
enough rotation, right?

102
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,458
I'm sure it did.

103
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:53,916

what's the base value?

have in mind for next season?

109
00:06:26,916 --> 00:06:28,458
[VICTOR]
Hm.

110
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,458
[VICTOR] It was easy enough
to surprise everyone

111
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:34,791
when I approached each
program like a new beginning.

112
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:36,166
But constantly starting over

113
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:39,166
means never building
anything solid.

114
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:42,208
"I don't need anyone.
I'm strongest on my own."

At least, that's what I thought.

116
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:47,708
[MOROOKA] All right, here comes
the score for Yuri Katsuki.

Ninety-seven point eight three.


118
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:50,916
He didn't break
the hundred mark,


119
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,125

while he skated at a rink in
the Bangkok commercial district.

He moved by himself to Detroit
to train under Coach Celestino.
