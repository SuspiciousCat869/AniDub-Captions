[VICTOR]
Sometimes you need a vacation.

2
00:01:41,375 --> 00:01:43,333
Time away from your
hectic everyday life

3
00:01:43,416 --> 00:01:46,125
when you can relax
and be yourself.

4
00:01:46,208 --> 00:01:47,958
On the rare occasions
when I take time

5
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:50,833
away from skating,
two "L-words" come into mind.

6
00:01:50,916 --> 00:01:53,166
"Life" and "love."

7
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:57,541
I've spent the last 20 years
neglecting both of them.

11

[VICTOR]
It's not Siberia,

12
00:02:06,041 --> 00:02:08,000
but Barcelona's still
cold in December.

13
00:02:08,083 --> 00:02:10,375
[CHRISTOPHE] I figured that
a Russian would be the only one

14
00:02:10,458 --> 00:02:12,750
besides me stupid enough
to get into the pool

15
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:14,291
this time of year.

16
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:15,291
[VICTOR]
Hm?

17
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:16,541
[CHRISTOPHE]
I guess I was right.

18
00:02:16,625 --> 00:02:17,291
[VICTOR]
Chris!

19
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:20,041
Hi. How's Coach Victor?

20
00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:23,375
Here I was hoping I would
get to go skinny dipping.

21
00:02:23,458 --> 00:02:24,791
[VICTOR]
Don't let me stop you.

22
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:26,666
I'll even take
pictures if you want.

[camera shutter clicks]

24
00:02:28,083 --> 00:02:30,958
[VICTOR]
Hi! My name is Victor Nikiforov.

25
00:02:31,041 --> 00:02:33,750
I was kidding about
being on vacation.

26
00:02:33,833 --> 00:02:35,458
I just arrived
in Barcelona, Spain,

27
00:02:35,541 --> 00:02:38,666
for the Grand Prix
Figure Skating Final.

28
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:42,125
That is Christophe Giacometti
from Switzerland.

29
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:43,666
[CHRISTOPHE] I'm one of
the oldest skaters left

30
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,208
now that you're gone.

31
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:47,750
[sighs]

32
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:50,041
I'm a relic at age 25!

33
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:52,375
[VICTOR] These days,
Chris practically oozes sex

34
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:54,750
whether he's on
the ice of off of it.

35
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:57,291
But when I first met him
at the European Championships,

36
00:02:57,375 --> 00:02:58,750
he was like a pure little boy

37
00:02:58,833 --> 00:03:00,916
running through
the Swiss meadows.

38
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,250
I've shared the podium with him

39
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:05,125
at many Grand Prix Finals,
European Championships,

40
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:07,666
and World Championships
over the years.

41
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,750
We've been skating against
each other for so long,

42
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:11,875
I can't imagine
a season without him,

43
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:13,583
and he worried he'd
lose all motivation

44
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:15,875
without me to compete
against this year.

45
00:03:15,958 --> 00:03:18,541
As it turns out,
he was wrong about that.

46
00:03:18,625 --> 00:03:20,666
He made it to the
Grand Prix Final.

47
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:24,916
Yuri! Check yourself in now.

48
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,333
You check in for me.

49
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:28,416
I don't feel like
dealing with it.

Yuri Plisetsky!

55
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:35,833
We do not use such
unattractive words.

[growls]

57
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:40,166
[VICTOR] From Russia,
we have Yuri Plisetsky.

58
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:42,291
Only 15, he qualified
for the Final

59
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:44,583
in his first year
at the senior level.

60
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:48,125
He's a feisty tomcat studying
under my former coach, Yakov.

61
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:52,750
During a visit to Japan,
he earned the nickname "Yurio."

62
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:55,375
His rabid fans are
known as "Yuri's Angels"

63
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:59,416
and show up in droves to support
him at every competition.

64
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,583
[PLISETSKY groaning]

65
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:03,041
[ISABELLA]
Wow, he's a popular one, huh?

66
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:04,583
Yuri's Angels are famous.

67
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:05,750
They're quite enthusiastic.

68
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:07,000
Oh?

69
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:08,916
[ISABELLA]
JJ Girls are enthusiastic

70
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,791
but we show more restraint.
Not to mention, we're cuter.

71
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:12,916
[growls]

72
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,333
Who the hell do
you think you are,

73
00:04:14,416 --> 00:04:16,333
talking about my fans
like that? <i>Vedma</i> !

74
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:19,041
He's a scary little boy.
Protect me, JJ.

75
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:20,750
[JEAN-JACQUES] Don't pay
attention to him, darling.

76
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:24,708
He's just jealous because
my fiancée is so beautiful.

77
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:27,583
[VICTOR] And that one is
Jean-Jacques Leroy, from Canada.

78
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:29,375
He's a strong contender
for the gold,

79
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:30,708
but there's something about him

80
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:33,583
that keeps the other
competitors at arm's length.

81
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:37,666
Any guy who wears
sunglasses on his head

82
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,291
like that is a douche.

83
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:41,125
You can do better
than him, bitch.

00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:42,375
--Hey now, easy.
--[ISABELLA] Scary!

[VICTOR] Otabek Altin
from Kazakhstan, age 18.

89
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:57,958
He was one of the first
to qualify for the GP Final.

90
00:04:58,041 --> 00:05:00,541
He shared the podium with me
at World's last season,

91
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:02,833
and he had a certain
presence about him.

92
00:05:02,916 --> 00:05:05,833
People don't know much about
his personal life, though.

93
00:05:05,916 --> 00:05:07,625
[JEAN-JACQUES]
Going out to eat alone?

94
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:09,833
Still as odd
as ever, aren't you?

95
00:05:09,916 --> 00:05:12,083
You can join us
for dinner if you want.

96
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:14,083
Thanks, I'll pass.

97
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:15,291

He doesn't seem interested

Okay!

[VICTOR]
Phichit Chulanont from Thailand.

109
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:45,083
He won the Cup of China,
becoming the first skater

110
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:48,208
from Southeast Asia to qualify
for the Grand Prix Final.

111
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:52,166
He's a talented skater, but he's
also a gifted taker of selfies.

112
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,833
He was Yuri's rink
mate back in Detroit.

113
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:57,166
And Yuri says he's
the only foreign skater

114
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:58,708
that he considers a friend.

115
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:01,291
The last of the six skaters
to make it to the Final

116
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:04,083
qualified by a hair's breadth
after placing fourth

117
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:05,833
at the Rostelecom Cup.

118

That would be this
jet-lagged sleeping beauty.

119

Yuri Katsuki of Japan.

120
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:12,958
He's the reason I'm here.

121
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:15,750
I've been Yuri's
coach this season.

122
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,416
After the Rostelecom Cup,

123
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,625
Yuri spent the remaining
days until the Final

124
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:22,958
getting in as much
practice time as he could.

125
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:25,041
Hard to believe it's
already been eight months

126
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:28,583
since I came to Hasetsu.
I can't remember when I last

127
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:30,833
spent this much time
with Makkachin.

128
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:32,916
Every day, I get to
soak in a bath

129
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,500
bigger than any tub.

130
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:37,833
And I get to eat as many pork
cutlet bowls as I could want.

131
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:39,791
This is heaven on earth.

132
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:42,208
I've learned a lot over
the past eight months.

Yuri's life and love
have opened up

00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:48,000
a brand new world for me,
one I never new existed.

00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,458
[VICTOR] Yuri's planned an
aggressive jump composition,

160
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:12,500
including a quadruple flip,
which he's yet to land,

161
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:14,500
for his final free skate jump.

162
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:16,791
Even if he skates
a flawless program,

163
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:20,458
if he sticks with his old jumps,
JJ has a higher base score.

164
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:23,416
[JEAN-JACQUES]
Enough practice for today.

165
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,958
I'm off, everybody.

[growls]

167
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:28,958
Right. Let's go over it
one more time, Yuri.

168
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:31,125
What should we do
with the rest of the day?

169
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:32,666
You should probably
take it easy.

170
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:35,375
Get a good night's sleep before
the short program tomorrow.

171
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:38,333
Don't you go turning into
a model coach on me now.

172
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:40,333
This is my first time
in to Barcelona.

173
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:42,166
Take me sightseeing!

174
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:47,458
Your wish is my command.

Yay!

Perfecto!

178

[VICTOR]
Ah! I haven't shopped in ages.

179
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:56,250
This is fun!

180
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:58,625
I think I need a break.

181
00:08:58,708 --> 00:09:01,875
I only wish we could've come
when the Euro was weaker.

182
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,125
You're having fun, da?

183
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:04,833
Oh. Mm-hm!

184
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:06,583
[VICTOR] Every competitor
has a different way

185
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:07,916
of winding down.

186
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,458
Yuri doesn't normally
suggest we go sightseeing.

187
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:11,541
Maybe that's an indicator

188
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:14,000
of just how nervous
he is this time.

189

[VICTOR]
All right, then.

[VICTOR]
Come on!

191
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:21,833
I'm going to buy you
a suit for your birthday.

192
00:09:21,916 --> 00:09:23,375
And then we can burn
the suit and tie

193
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:26,083
you wore at that
press conference.

194
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:27,166
Huh?

195
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:28,708
Hold on a sec, you don't
have to do that!

196
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:31,291
And besides, I kind of
like that suit.

Yurochka, where are you?

200
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:38,500
[PLISETSKY FANGIRL 10A] I wanted
him to come to the fan meeting!

201
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:40,291
[gasps] I have his scent!

202
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:41,250
It leads that way!

00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:42,500
Ah! A piece of his hair!

204
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:44,458
He's nearby.

Yuri, get on.

What? Why would you...?

Hey, it's Yurochka!

Look!

00:09:57,875 --> 00:10:00,000
He's with Otabek Altin!

Huh? Huh?

[VICTOR] Athletes aren't
the only ones sensitive

00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:11,750
to the unexpected
tailwinds of life.

Catch the right breeze,

to worlds unknown.

219
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,833
News that the hero of
Kazakhstan had kidnapped

220
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:22,583
the fairy of Russia spread
across the world like wildfire.

221
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:25,041
[VICTOR]
However, the brooding hero

222
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,333
wasn't acting on a simple whim.

223
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:31,083
Yurio didn't think that he and
Otabek had any prior connection.

224
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:33,333
What he didn't remember
was that five years before,

225
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:36,875
they had trained together
at Yakov's summer camp.

[PLISETSKY]
Really?

Oh, yeah.

228
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:40,666
[PLISETSKY]
I don't remember that.

229
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:43,000
It was actually my first year
in the junior division.

230
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:46,708
But I wasn't skating at the same
level as the Russian juniors.

231
00:10:46,791 --> 00:10:49,125
So I was placed
in the novice class,

232
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:51,333
which is where I met you.

Yuri Plisetsky.

234
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:54,916
It was your eyes
that I noticed first.

235
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,958
The strong, piercing
eyes of a soldier.

236
00:10:57,041 --> 00:11:02,291
Me, really? A soldier?

237
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:06,166
I had moved my home rink
from Moscow to St. Petersburg.

238
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:09,083
I was desperate to
make a name for myself.

239
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:13,291
I swore I would do whatever
I had to to make that happen.

240
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:15,458
After that camp,
I moved around to train,

241
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:18,458
from Russia to the US
and then to Canada.

242
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:22,375
I only managed to return to my
home rink in Almaty last year.

Now, more than ever,

[PLISETSKY]
Otabek.

246
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:31,708
I don't get why you would
talk to me. We're rivals.

247
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:33,041
Since I met you at that camp,

248
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:35,375
I've always thought
we were alike.

249
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:37,250
That's all there is to it.

250
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:42,458
Not so complicated,
really. So, friends?

251

[VICTOR]
Nobody had ever asked Yurio

252
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:48,416
if he wanted to be friends
with them before.

where I'm shopping with Yuri.

Here, things had taken
a turn for the worse.

[YURI]
No luck. It's not here, either.

Okay, just calm down
and try to remember.

258
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:05,083
It's a bag of nuts.
Brown paper with green print.

259
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:07,000
Where did we last see it?

260
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:10,041
[YURI sighs] Sorry. I don't
know where else to look.

261
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:11,333
This was my best guess.

262
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:13,375
I'll go back to the shop
and get another bag!

[VICTOR]
Don't worry about it, Yuri.

I'm sure the shop is
probably closed by now.

265
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:20,500
Let's go. You're tired, right?

Why are you just
assuming that I'm tired?

Fine, then, I'm tired.

[VICTOR] Mm. In Russia, we don't
celebrate before the actual day.

celebrate Christmas,

No.

He gets quiet and
his eyes sparkle.

He's looking for
something right now

until he finds it.

just watch over him.

I was always on my own then,
at the banquet, too.

It was the most disgusting

I got dragged into a dance-off.
It was humiliating.

a pole and got naked.

[VICTOR] The banquet is

Last year,

Yuri suffered a crushing
defeat at the final.

365

It looked like his coach
had dragged him to the banquet.

366

At first, anyway.

367
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:33,750
Since he couldn't
bring himself to mingle,

368
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:36,875
he just kept drinking,
and drinking...
