After the Final, let's end this.

00:00:13,083 --> 00:00:14,958
What?

3
00:00:15,041 --> 00:00:16,750
You've already done
more than enough for me,

4
00:00:16,833 --> 00:00:18,708
more than I could've dreamed of.

5
00:00:18,791 --> 00:00:21,166
My final season was
my best one yet.

6
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:23,666
That's because of you.

7
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:26,208
Thank you for
everything, so much.

8
00:00:26,291 --> 00:00:29,375
Thank you for being my coach.

[VICTOR]
Damn it.

12
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:42,291
That's disappointing.

13
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:44,750
I didn't expect this
from you of all people.

14
00:00:44,833 --> 00:00:46,625
Something so selfish.

15
00:00:46,708 --> 00:00:51,541
[YURI] Selfish or not,
it's my decision. I'm retiring.

16
00:00:54,625 --> 00:00:57,291
Yes, Yuri? What are
you looking at?

17
00:00:57,375 --> 00:01:00,041
[YURI] Um, I'm just
surprised to see you cry.

18
00:01:00,125 --> 00:01:02,750
I'm mad, okay? What should I do?

19
00:01:02,833 --> 00:01:03,916
You're the one who said

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,125
it was only until
the Grand Prix Final!

21
00:01:06,208 --> 00:01:07,791
[VICTOR] I thought you'd
eventually decide

22
00:01:07,875 --> 00:01:10,125
you wanted my help
for longer than that.

23
00:01:10,208 --> 00:01:11,125
It's okay.

24
00:01:11,208 --> 00:01:13,416
You don't need
to worry about me.

25
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,666
This way you can
make your comeback--

26
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:16,333
Stop! I don't want to hear it!

27
00:01:16,416 --> 00:01:18,125
How can you tell me
to return to the ice

28
00:01:18,208 --> 00:01:20,500
when you're retiring?

29
00:01:20,583 --> 00:01:21,875
[YURI]
We decided that we would each

30
00:01:21,958 --> 00:01:25,083
make our own decision after
the free skate was over.

Tonight, we'll
have our champion.

34
00:01:41,541 --> 00:01:43,708
In first is Russia's
Yuri Plisetsky,

35
00:01:43,791 --> 00:01:46,125
with the highest ever
short program score.

36
00:01:46,208 --> 00:01:48,250
Otabek Altin,
hero of Kazakhstan,

37
00:01:48,333 --> 00:01:50,833
is ranked second in his
first Grand Prix Final.

38
00:01:50,916 --> 00:01:52,625
Christophe Giacometti
of Switzerland

39
00:01:52,708 --> 00:01:55,583
is in third after a very
distinct performance.

40
00:01:55,666 --> 00:01:57,541
Yuri Katsuki hopes
to turn fourth place

41
00:01:57,625 --> 00:01:59,750
into a spot on the podium.

42
00:01:59,833 --> 00:02:01,708
Phichit Chulanont,
the first Thai skater

43
00:02:01,791 --> 00:02:04,000
to qualify for the
Final, is in fifth.

44
00:02:04,083 --> 00:02:06,166
And, shockingly,
Jean-Jacques Leroy of Canada

45
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:07,833
enters the free skate in sixth.

46
00:02:07,916 --> 00:02:09,291
Will he make a comeback?

47
00:02:09,375 --> 00:02:11,166
The last chapter of
the Grand Prix Final

48
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:12,791
is about to begin.

This is Stéphane Lambiel
reporting from Barcelona.

Now over to Morooka.

51

Thank you, Morooka here.

52
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,375
Japan's Yuri Katsuki has
not practiced publicly

53
00:02:21,458 --> 00:02:23,291
since the day after
the short program.

54
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:25,333
His supporters have been
concerned by his sudden

55
00:02:25,416 --> 00:02:26,916
and unexplained disappearance.

56
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,333
But he did return to the ice for
this morning's public practice.

It's been a while.
Good to see you again.

60
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:37,416
We hope Yuri's supporters will
cheer loudly for him today.

61
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,833

I'm sure they will.

Thanks for speaking
with us. <i>Bon Chance</i> .

63

I have to say, neither Yuri
Katsuki nor his coach Victor

64
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:46,875
seem to have the energy we've
come to expect from them.

Jean-Jacques Leroy of Canada.

He is far behind after
a series of mistakes

he didn't enter the jump

82

His practice was
full of mistakes, too.

Still, he is the sole
skater among the final six

with four quads in his program.

my way onto the podium

out of it, but overall,

it during practice.

competition with you

469
00:21:18,416 --> 00:21:20,000
for one more year.

470
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:22,166
And this time I'll win gold!

471
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:23,583
[gasps]

472
00:21:23,666 --> 00:21:26,041
Perfect! Well, almost.

473
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:27,541
Huh?

474
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:29,750
[VICTOR chuckles] Even for me,
it's not going to be easy

475
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:30,833
to make a full comeback

476
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:33,666
while also staying
on as your coach.

477
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:36,375
In exchange, I expect
five world championships

478
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:38,708
at the very least.

479
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:42,166
[YURI sniffles]

480
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:43,791
'Kay.

481
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:54,708
[MOROOKA] The is silver
medalist, Yuri Katsuki of Japan.

482
00:21:54,791 --> 00:21:56,375
His exhibition is a free program

483
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:58,541
previously performed
by his coach.

484
00:21:58,625 --> 00:22:01,875
Victor Nikiforov has just
announced his own comeback.

485
00:22:01,958 --> 00:22:04,916
This is last year's
"Stay Close to Me."

486
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,958
["Stay Close to Me" playing]

487
00:22:16,416 --> 00:22:19,208
[AUDIENCE cheers]

488
00:22:25,958 --> 00:22:29,291
[AUDIENCE cheers]

489
00:22:32,833 --> 00:22:37,083
[AUDIENCE cheers]

490
00:23:16,541 --> 00:23:19,666
[YURI panting]

491
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:22,833
[YURI] There's a place
you just can't reach

492
00:23:22,916 --> 00:23:26,750
unless you have a dream that's
too large to bear alone.

493
00:23:26,833 --> 00:23:32,375
Win or lose, we call
everything on the ice "love."

494
00:23:33,833 --> 00:23:34,916
[VICTOR]
Yuri!
