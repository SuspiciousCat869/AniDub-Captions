Apparently, he saw the video
of you skating his routine.

00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:43,583
Remember, you're not
setting foot in this rink

159
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:46,041
until you drop
some weight, little piggy.

160
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:47,625
[YURI]
Not exactly awesome

161
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:50,375
in the pep talk department,
though, is he?

162
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:51,375
[MINAKO]
Maybe he was just looking

163
00:07:51,458 --> 00:07:53,000
for an excuse to take a break.

164
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:54,583
Come on, don't say that.

165
00:07:54,666 --> 00:07:56,875
It's what I think too,
but I don't like hearing it.

166
00:07:56,958 --> 00:07:59,625
[MINAKO] Listen. You want
to keep skating, don't you?

167
00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:00,791
Uh.

168
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:02,708
Then you need all
the help you can get!

169
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:05,333
Now, let's trim off
some fat, shall we?

170
00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:08,625
Yeah. Okay.

171
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:11,166
[YURI] These days,
Minako is a ballet instructor.

172
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,541
But when she was younger,

173
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:16,625
she used to travel all
over the world as a dancer.

174
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:19,625
When I was younger, I went
to her studio all the time.

175
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:22,791
I spent more time in
her ballet class than at home.

176
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:23,916
She's the one who suggested

177
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,041
I start skating
in the first place.

178
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:28,041
She's always
been really supportive.

179
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:29,708
But she does like to meddle.

180
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:31,500
So, do you have
feelings for Minako?

181
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:33,125
Huh? No, no way!

182
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:34,625
Do you have a lover now?

183
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:35,500
No.

184
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,666
What about ex-lovers?

185
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,125
I'd rather not talk about it.

186
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:40,333
Then let's talk about me!
Let's see, my first lover--

187
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:41,458
[YURI]
Stop!

188
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:43,500
[sighs]

189
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:44,625
[MAKKACHIN barks]

190
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:45,875
[VICTOR]
Hmm?

191
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:48,416
Hey, Yuri. What's that
building up there? 

192
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,250
People call it Hasetsu Castle,

193
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:52,166
but inside it's really
a ninja house!

194
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:55,458
Huh?! Really? No way!

195
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:57,291
Hasetsu Castle!

196
00:08:57,375 --> 00:08:58,500
I wanna see!

197
00:08:58,583 --> 00:09:00,041
[MAN A] Now there's
an enthusiastic tourist.

198
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:02,583
[VICTOR]
Ninja! Yes!

199
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:06,541
[PLISETSKY]
Hasetsu Castle?

200
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:09,041
Does he wanna be
a ninja or something?

201
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:12,625
Okay. Now I know where he is.

202
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:15,000
Just wait, Victor.
I'll see you soon.

203
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:16,791
[hums]
Oh?

204
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:18,541
[MARI]
Huh?

205
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:20,625
So Is it true that
Victor's staying at this inn?

206
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:22,875
[RANDOM WOMAN A]
Can we take a bath with him?

207
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:27,500
I don't remember the last time
we had this many customers!

208
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:29,208
[RANDOM MALE REPORTER C]
Is Victor here? Please!

209
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:30,833
Can we talk to him?

210
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:32,208
[RANDOM MALE REPORTER D] We'd
like to film a special feature!

211
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:35,166
What the hell is
going on here?

212
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,250
[RANDOM WOMAN D] I can't
believe how beautiful he is!

213
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:39,958
[WOMAN A]
Excuse me, can I get a photo?

214
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:41,166
[FEMALE STUDENT A]
Victor's at Ice Castle!

215
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:42,250
Can you freakin' believe it?

216
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:43,833
[FEMALE STUDENT B]
So hot!

217
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:55,833
[PLISETSKY]
Wow. Creepy.

218
00:09:57,666 --> 00:09:58,708
[PLISETSKY]
Oh, crap.

219
00:09:58,791 --> 00:10:00,041
If I post this,

220
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:01,958
Yakov'll know I'm here and
come to haul me back.

221
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:05,333
[PLISETSKY] This is
the city that was tagged

222
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:08,041
in all the pics
Victor's been uploading.

223
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:13,125
Hey! Victor come out!
Do you hear me?

224
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:14,416
Whoa!

225
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:17,791
That shirt. I want it now!

226
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:18,958
[YAKOV]
Yuri!

227
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:20,250
Would you like to explain to me

228
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:21,958
what the hell you're
doing in Japan?

229
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:23,666
Whoops. You found out?

230
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:26,125
[YAKOV] You're not in the junior
leagues any more, idiot!

231
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:27,291
You should be training!

232
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:29,041
Don't tell me what to do!

233
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:31,833
I'm not coming back to Russia
until Victor makes good

234
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:34,333
on his promise to me!

235
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:36,750
Man. He's such a nag.

236
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:39,833
I can handle myself without
any help from that geezer.

237
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:44,583
[PLISETSKY]
I'm supposed to do

238
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:47,083
a triple Salchow, but...

239
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:48,750
Don't even think about it, Yuri.

240
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:51,541
[PLISETSKY]
I can do it.

241
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:52,208
[AUDIENCE claps]

242
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:53,875
A Quadruple Salchow?

243
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:55,958
[PLISETSKY]
See that, Yakov?

244
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:58,666
You idiot! How many
times to I have to tell you

245
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:01,166
quads are strictly
off-limits until you're older?

246
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:04,250
If you can't follow orders,
then maybe you should quit!

247
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:06,166
[laughs]
Go easy.

248
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,000
Don't be so tough
on him all the time.

249
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:10,583
This has nothing
to do with you, Victor!

250
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:14,083
I know how you feel. I got
yelled at for doing that, too.

251
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:16,666
But you can win,
even without doing quads.

252
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,083
I'd bet money on it.

253
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:21,791
I think you can win
the Junior Worlds'.

254
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:24,000
Okay, if I win without
doing any quads,

255
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:27,583
I want you to choreograph
a program, just for me!

256
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:30,666
[VICTOR]
It's a deal.

257
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:34,000
After you win the Junior World
Championship, come see me.

258
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:37,500
I'll make sure you have
the best senior debut ever.

259
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:44,291
Huh?! Where am I?
Hey, Victor!

260
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:46,750
Oh? Are you a fan of Victor's?

261
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:48,583
He spends a lot
of time practicing

262
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,500
at the skating rink
below the castle.

263
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:52,125
I would try there.

Come on, just let us watch!

for a private practice session.

see him.

Of course, O Great One!

My weight's back to what it was
before the Grand Prix Final.

Now Victor will <i>finally</i>
give me permission to skate!

What's he doing here?

00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:40,750
And why's he standing
on my head?

286
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:43,666
[LOOP] The Japanese Yuri and the
Russian Yuri in the same place.

This is perfect!

what I'm thinking?

00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:47,791
Heee...

290
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:49,208
[PLISETSKY]
A long time ago Victor promised

291
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:51,250
he'd choreograph
a program for me.

292
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:52,333
He promise you, too?

293
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:54,250
Uh, we haven't
exactly gotten around

294
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:55,666
to talking about programs.

295
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:58,166
Huh? If you're not
working on a new program,

296
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:59,291
then what have you been doing?

297
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:01,041
Why's he wasting time on you?

298
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:02,458
If he knew about
your little sob-fest

299
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:04,041
in the bathroom
at the Grand Prix,

300
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:07,708
he'd realize there's no point in
training a big crybaby like you.

301
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:08,916
[YURI]
The Russian Punk.

302
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,083
Maybe it's time
for you to retire.

303
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:13,458
Hmph!

304
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:16,791
[YURI]
He's really underestimating me.

305
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:18,916
I don't know what history
you and Victor have.

306
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,166
You should talk to him yourself.

307
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:23,041
It's not like I made
Victor come to Hasetsu.

308
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:25,625
He came because
he wanted to be my coach.

309
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,166
[gasps]

310
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:31,166
[PLISETSKY]
I recognize those moves.

311
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,875
They're for the
short program Victor

312
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:35,166
was choreographing
for next season.

00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:36,458

314
00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:37,791
Before he decided to come here,

315
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:40,250
he was putting together
routines for next season.

316
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:42,708
But he was really torn.

317
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:44,458
Surprising the audience
has always been

318
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:46,250
what he cared most about.

319
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:48,666
For years the skating
world has worshipped him.

320
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:52,250
Now, no matter what he does,
no one's surprised anymore.

321
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:54,958
He knows that and
it really eats at him.

322
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:56,250
He doesn't feel inspired,

323
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:59,333
and without inspiration
you're as good as dead.

324
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:01,250
I wonder if he'll
let me use his program.

325
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:03,500
He doesn't need it if he's
gonna take off this season.

326
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:04,375
Huh?

327
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:05,416
If he'll give me a chance,

328
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,208
I know I can
surprise the audience.

329
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:08,875
I'm going to make
my debut as a senior

330
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:10,625
and win the Grand Prix Final.

331
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:12,583
But I need
Victor's help to do it!

332
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:13,833
[gasps]

333
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:16,000
Wow. You're confident.

334
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:18,583
Hey Victor, you got
time for a little chat?

335
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:20,958
Hey, I didn't know
you were here!

336
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:22,833
I'm surprised
Yakov let you come.

337
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:24,333
You need something?

338
00:14:24,416 --> 00:14:26,375
Uh-oh! That's not a happy face!

339
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:30,083
Let me guess: I forgot to do
something I said I would do?

340
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:32,666
[laughs]
Yeah, I remember now.

341
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,375
It totally slipped my mind!

342
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:37,291
I'm sorry, but you know
how I forget stuff sometimes.

343
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:39,500
[PLISETSKY]
Yeah. I'm painfully aware.

344
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:41,375
But I'm holding you
to your promise.

345
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:44,416
You'll choreograph my
new program like you said.

346
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,875
We're going back to Russia!

347
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:48,875
[YURI]
Eh... Huh?!

348
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,291
[VICTOR]
Hmm...

349
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:55,791
Okay, I've got it!

350
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:58,875
I'm going to choreograph
a program for both of you--

351
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:00,333
to the same music.

352
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:01,833
Huh?!

353
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:02,833
--The same music as this guy?
--Choreograph both of us?

354
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:04,250
Now, don't worry boys,

355
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:06,041
this piece has two
different arrangements.

356
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:08,583
I've just been trying
to decide which one to use.

357
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:10,916
I'll design two programs
using different portions

358
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,916
of the same song.

359
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,375
The programs will
be revealed in one week.

360
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:17,291
The two of you will
compete to see which one

361
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:18,708
can surprise
the audience more!

362
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:21,208
Whoa! A competition?
Is that really necessary?

363
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:24,166
The catch is, Victor has to
do whatever the winner wants.

364
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:25,666
What do you say?

365
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,833
Perfect! I love
this sort of thing!

366
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:29,458
[TRIPLETS]
Wait just a minute!

367
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:30,875
If you wanna use our rink,

368
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:33,791
you'd better let us in
on the action, you got me?

369
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:36,583
An epic face-off
between Russia and Japan.

370
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:37,583
It's gonna be big!

371
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:39,666
Let's get ready to rumble!

372
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:43,000
[FEMALE NEWSCASTER A]
We've got exciting news, folks!

373
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:45,708
In one week the special
exhibition "Hot Springs on Ice"

374
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:47,625
will premiere at
Ice Castle Hasetsu.

375
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:50,583
You don't want to miss a once-
in-a-lifetime event like this!

376
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:52,250
This place is a real hovel.

377
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:53,458
So, where's my room, anyway?

378
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:55,416
Wait a sec! You're staying here?

379
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,458
No way I'm letting you
have Victor to yourself

380
00:15:57,541 --> 00:15:59,000
all the time, fatso.

381
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,500
So I'm staying here, okay?

382
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:03,000
If I say no, is there any
chance you'll actually leave?

383
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:04,625
The hot spring here
is just divine.

384
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:09,000
I'm not taking a bath with
other people. Now goodnight!

385
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:11,583
[stomach grumbling]

386
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:14,125
I want food and a bath.

387
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:17,166
[sighs]

388
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:19,541
So good!

389
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:20,750
Can't beat the pork cutlet bowl.

390
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:23,208
Jeez, Yuri, you
have another visitor?

391
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:25,666
Huh? Huh?!

392
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:27,125
Aaah!

393
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:29,875
[MARI] No way! He looks
like my idol, The Blond Takao!

394
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:31,791
His name is Yuri,
too, isn't that funny?

395
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:34,000
Huh? That's just
gonna be confusing.

396
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:35,916
We'll call you Yurio.

397
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:36,958
Huh?

398
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:38,708
So, where will
Yurio be sleeping?

399
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:39,500
[YURI]
Upstairs?

400
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:40,666
What, in the storage room?

401
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,833
It's gonna need a
major cleaning first.

402
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:43,916
Yuri, come help me.

403
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,666
[YURI]
Uh?

404
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:49,958
[VICTOR] Looks like
you have a fan, Yurio.

405
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:51,958
I'm not gonna
go by that stupid name!

406
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:54,958
[laughs]

407
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:59,708
[YURI]
Oh, man. I'm an idiot.

408
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:02,625
The other Yuri is the
one with all the potential.

409
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:04,291
He's so confident.

410
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:05,833
His first year
at the senior level,

411
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:08,375
and he's sure he'll
win the Grand Prix.

412
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:10,083
And he doesn't turn
into a blubbering mess

413
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:11,750
whenever Victor talks to him.

414
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:13,916
He belongs with Victor. Not me.

415
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,875
[VICTOR]
Hey, where's Yuri?

416
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:17,708
He headed out a while ago.

417
00:17:17,791 --> 00:17:19,458
He either ran off
to Minako's place

418
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:21,625
or else down to Ice Castle.

419
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:23,708
It's what he does.

420
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:25,708
[MINAKO]
Huh? Yuri?

421
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:27,125
He's not here.

422
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:29,791
If she said my place,
she meant my ballet studio.

423
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:33,708
See, when Yuri gets anxious,
practicing chills him out.

424
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:36,750
So he goes down to the rink,
and I usually go with him.

425
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:38,458
Ice Castle lets
him skate anytime

426
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:40,333
if it's not already booked.

427
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:42,208
Yuri's always been
an anxious guy.

428
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:44,500
He only came as far as he did
because he had a safe place

429
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:46,666
where he could
practice on his own.

430
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,583
He's no genius,
but he works hard,

431
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:50,750
and he truly loves to skate.

432
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:52,083
[NISHIGORI] He's been
coming here to practice

433
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:53,500
by himself forever.

434
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:56,125
It shows you how much
he loves the sport, you know?

435
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:58,833
As a kid, he didn't even
play with his friends.

436
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:00,750
To be fair, it's not like
he was ever any good

437
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:02,500
at making friends to play with.

438
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:04,083
He's not great at
putting himself out there,

439
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,833
on or off the ice.

440
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:08,125
I don't want this
to be the end for him.

441
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:10,791
No, neither do I, the thing
you should know about Yuri is,

442
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:12,916
he's actually a
pretty sore loser.

443
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,458
I hope you can
bring out a side of him

444
00:18:14,541 --> 00:18:17,166
that we've never seen before.

445
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:19,166
[VICTOR]
Hmm...

446
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:21,000
So all I have
to do is find a way

447
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:23,041
to turn a piggy into a prince?

448
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:23,916
[NISHIGORI, YUKO]
Huh?

449
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,750
[VICTOR]
Nothing. Never mind.

450
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:29,916
Thanks. I feel like
I know Yuri a lot better know.

451
00:18:34,083 --> 00:18:35,750
[VICTOR]
Lovely day, isn't it?

452
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:36,750
Morning, Victor.

453
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:38,666
[VICTOR]
Be polite, Yurio. Say hi!

454
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:42,291
I told you I'm not
answering to that name!

455
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:43,625
[YURI]
Victor's finally going to

456
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:45,250
start coaching me today!

457
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:48,000
This'll decide whether
or not it's my last season.

458
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:51,125
If I wuss out now, I'm done.

459
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:55,250
[YURI] First, I'm going to be
the Hot Springs on Ice champion.

460
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:59,166
And then, I'll set my sights
on the Grand Prix Final!

461
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:03,250
We will start by
listening to the music.

462
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:12,000
[slow song playing]

463
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:13,791
[VICTOR] This piece
has two arrangements--

464
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:16,041
each with a different theme.

465
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:19,333
The title of it is
"On Love: Eros and Agape."

466
00:19:19,416 --> 00:19:22,291
Have you ever spent much
time thinking about love?

467
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:23,208
<i>Nyet</i> .

468
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:24,541
[VICTOR]
All right, then.

469
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:26,125
How does this
song make you feel?

470
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:28,083
What does it say to you?

471
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:30,166
It has a very pure,
innocent sound to it,

472
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:32,333
like someone who hasn't
experienced love yet.

473
00:19:32,416 --> 00:19:34,125
Whatever, I think it sucks.

474
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:37,500
This "innocence" crap
makes me wanna puke. Blurgh!

475
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:39,625
[VICTOR]
Okay.

476
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:49,333
[upbeat song plays]

477
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:51,291
Wow, this sounds like
a completely different song.

478
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:52,708
[PLISETSKY]
I call dibs!

479
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:56,708
This is the one
I want to skate to.

480
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:59,250
[VICTOR] The first arrangement
is "On Love: Agape."

481
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:01,208
The theme is unconditional love.

482
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:02,541
[YURI gulps]

483
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:05,291
This is "On Love: Eros."

484
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:07,500
And the theme of
it is sexual love.

485
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:09,875
[PLISETSKY]
Hmph!

486
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:11,583
[VICTOR] I am going to
have the two of you skate

487
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:13,500
to these opposing themes.

488
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:15,291
Here are your assignments.

489
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:16,416
You get Eros.

490
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,625
You get Agape.

491
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:22,000
We should switch!
That's so not me!

492
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:24,041
You should always try
to do the exact opposite

493
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:26,083
of what people are
expecting from you.

494
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:29,250
How else can you surprise them?
That's my motto.

495
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:30,666
The truth is:

496
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:33,083
you're actually both far more
mediocre than you think.

497
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:35,375
You need to be more self-aware.

498
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:37,458
I'm surprised you don't
realize how much work

499
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:39,375
you both need
to do on your images.

500
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:42,541
Right now to the audience you're
just a piglet and a kitten.

501
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:44,833
You had better be up to
my standards by next week.

502
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:47,875
Or I won't continue
to work with either of you.

503
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:51,250
But don't worry, as fans of
mine, I'm sure you'll manage.

504
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:54,125
[PLISETSKY]
Okay, fine.

505
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:57,875
I'll skate to "Agape." My senior
division debut depends on it.

506
00:20:57,958 --> 00:21:01,083
But you had better give me
a program that I can win with!

507
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:03,333
Whether you win
or not is up to you.

508
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:07,291
It would be a winning
program if I skated it.

509
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:10,333
If I win, you are coming
back to Russia with me. Okay?

510
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:14,208
And you'll be my coach. Well,
do you accept those terms?

511
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:16,250
Hmm. I do.

512
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:18,541
[gasps]

513
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:19,916
Hmph!

514
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,333
Well, what do you want from me?

515
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:24,916
If you win, what is your reward?

516
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,458
To eat with you--pork
cutlet bowls.

517
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:30,541
Huh?

518
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:31,708
I want to keep on winning

519
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:33,666
and keep on eating
pork cutlet bowls!

520
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,666
So I'll skate to "Eros," Victor!

521
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:38,416
And I'll give it all
the eros I've got in me!

522
00:21:39,916 --> 00:21:43,000
[VICTOR] Good!
That's what I like to hear!

523
00:23:17,333 --> 00:23:19,833
[VICTOR] I wonder which of you
will be able to satisfy me.

524
00:23:19,916 --> 00:23:21,541
[YURI]
I will! I'm sure of it!

525
00:23:21,625 --> 00:23:22,875
[PLISETSKY]
I'll believe it when I see it!

526
00:23:22,958 --> 00:23:25,375
Don't underestimate Russia!

527
00:23:25,458 --> 00:23:27,333
[YURI, PLISETSKY]
Next time, Third Skate.

528
00:23:27,416 --> 00:23:31,333
"I am Eros, and Eros is Me?
Face-Off! Hot Springs on Ice!"
