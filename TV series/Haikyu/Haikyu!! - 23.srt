1
00:00:08,093 --> 00:00:09,300
The final set.

2
00:00:10,357 --> 00:00:12,819
Listen to me... Please keep winning!

3
00:00:17,955 --> 00:00:19,285
If we screw up now...

4
00:00:20,755 --> 00:00:21,515
we're done.

5
00:01:56,634 --> 00:01:57,619
Nice receive!

6
00:01:59,132 --> 00:01:59,963
Number ten!

7
00:02:02,494 --> 00:02:05,644
I'm sure they've already changed
the signal for the crazy quick attack.

8
00:02:06,531 --> 00:02:10,393
Well, it's a simple signal... So they
can switch it out pretty easily y'know.

9
00:02:10,901 --> 00:02:13,331
But still... there must be some sorta clue.

10
00:02:13,837 --> 00:02:17,101
I guess if we see him tracking
the ball... then it's a normal one.

11
00:02:17,328 --> 00:02:20,143
But if he just dives right in... then it's the quick.

12
00:02:20,518 --> 00:02:23,329
True, we need to watch Number 10 specifically.

13
00:02:23,928 --> 00:02:24,713
Good plan.

14
00:02:25,015 --> 00:02:25,799
Number Ten is...

15
00:02:25,824 --> 00:02:28,439
At the end of the day he's still just a decoy though...

16
00:02:28,619 --> 00:02:30,822
Don't forget that... alright guys?

17
00:02:31,004 --> 00:02:31,601
Right!

18
00:02:32,035 --> 00:02:32,815
Yeah!

19
00:02:38,441 --> 00:02:39,528
Not this time!

20
00:02:39,553 --> 00:02:41,335
We keep messing things up!

21
00:02:41,843 --> 00:02:42,940
Still rallying.

22
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:46,147
On average, they've got us beat at defense and blocking.

23
00:02:47,802 --> 00:02:48,475
A feint!

24
00:02:49,534 --> 00:02:52,467
Our libero does have some outstanding skill though.

25
00:02:52,812 --> 00:02:53,743
Asahi!

26
00:02:57,381 --> 00:02:58,735
The setter received it!

27
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,111
Now he can't make the set!

28
00:03:00,278 --> 00:03:01,747
Their attack's gonna flop.

29
00:03:01,772 --> 00:03:02,984
Watch 'em go left!

30
00:03:03,904 --> 00:03:05,105
It's all yours!

31
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:06,211
Mine!

32
00:03:15,046 --> 00:03:17,320
Looks like my hunch was right after all.

33
00:03:18,097 --> 00:03:21,583
I suspected Aoba-Johsai's libero started out as a setter.

34
00:03:22,674 --> 00:03:23,707
Why do you say that?

35
00:03:25,195 --> 00:03:26,347
Well, think about it.

36
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:32,753
If a libero crosses the attack line to do an overhand
set and somebody spikes it, then that's an illegal move.

37
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:40,202
So this guy jumped just behind the attack line to redirect
the ball in midair... Which makes it a valid spike.

38
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:43,578
He's got expertise in both positions.

39
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:46,560
Aoba-Johsai really knows what they're doing!

40
00:03:46,911 --> 00:03:51,016
Oooooooolé.

41
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:52,671
Agh! Heads up!

42
00:03:52,891 --> 00:03:53,708
Nice receive, Cap'n!

43
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:54,381
Asahi!

44
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,145
It's coming back!

45
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:00,920
Gotcha!

46
00:04:05,758 --> 00:04:06,538
Take that!

47
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:14,644
That was so close to the edge.

48
00:04:17,946 --> 00:04:19,198
Awesome...

49
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,121
You boys are doing great work out there...

50
00:04:25,254 --> 00:04:26,609
Let's keep it up now!

51
00:04:26,634 --> 00:04:27,341
Sir!

52
00:04:27,554 --> 00:04:30,046
They're starting to catch on to our center attacks,

53
00:04:30,071 --> 00:04:34,138
so I want you to make sure you're using the
full width of the court every chance you get!

54
00:04:34,163 --> 00:04:34,987
Right!

55
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:38,639
How can their offense be so perfectly airtight?!

56
00:04:39,564 --> 00:04:43,783
They turn every scenario into an
advantage, as if it was planned that way!

57
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:46,188
Let's do it guys!

58
00:04:46,213 --> 00:04:47,114
Sir!

59
00:04:47,624 --> 00:04:51,416
Putting in Sugawara for a little bit
really helped us get back on our game.

60
00:04:51,936 --> 00:04:54,568
It helped us lose a lot of unnecessary tension.

61
00:04:55,258 --> 00:04:58,938
I think all of our guys are
playing at their full potential, now.

62
00:04:59,756 --> 00:05:00,536
But them...

63
00:05:01,168 --> 00:05:03,272
They've been in the zone for a long time.

64
00:05:03,629 --> 00:05:05,038
This won't be easy.

65
00:05:10,178 --> 00:05:14,398
Yeah, Tsukishima! Get dirty and bite
'em in the ass when they're not looking!

66
00:05:14,431 --> 00:05:15,411
Um whoa.

67
00:05:15,784 --> 00:05:21,018
I'm sure even with everyone playing at
100%... Seijoh is still the more capable team...

68
00:05:22,007 --> 00:05:22,604
But...

69
00:05:23,095 --> 00:05:28,507
Having your strength drop to 70%... and then
quickly powering up above a hundred and twenty...

70
00:05:28,972 --> 00:05:31,140
That's what this game's all about, right?

71
00:05:33,347 --> 00:05:38,615
Besides, Karasuno has exactly what
we need to give us that turbo boost...

72
00:05:39,056 --> 00:05:40,974
We have our greatest decoy!

73
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:44,780
This is so much fun! And our opponent is so strong!

74
00:05:44,813 --> 00:05:46,783
I want to play... I want to play...

75
00:05:46,828 --> 00:05:48,169
Now, now, now!

76
00:05:48,194 --> 00:05:48,808
Hinata?

77
00:05:49,143 --> 00:05:49,749
Yeah?

78
00:05:49,776 --> 00:05:52,165
You do remember what Coach Ukai told us, right?

79
00:05:52,595 --> 00:05:54,946
To use the full width of the court... I know.

80
00:05:55,669 --> 00:05:58,361
Yes... And we have an attack that's perfect for that.

81
00:05:59,091 --> 00:06:01,058
But we've barely used it in this game.

82
00:06:06,248 --> 00:06:07,428
Yeah!

83
00:06:08,049 --> 00:06:09,377
I don't like this.

84
00:06:09,983 --> 00:06:12,255
The rest of the team is keeping it together, but...

85
00:06:12,655 --> 00:06:16,554
I can't help it, whenever that
little guy walks onto the court...

86
00:06:17,994 --> 00:06:19,570
It makes me nervous.

87
00:06:21,301 --> 00:06:26,816
He's been sitting in the warm-up zone for a long
time, letting all his frustration build up inside.

88
00:06:27,937 --> 00:06:30,985
Wow, Karasuno's really pulled
it together in the final set...

89
00:06:31,884 --> 00:06:34,763
but Seijoh always seems to be one step ahead of us.

90
00:06:35,181 --> 00:06:39,273
Those two... If there's any chance of
us catching up, it's gonna depend on them.

91
00:06:40,686 --> 00:06:44,027
Come on you guys, we need you
to get us that extra step ahead!

92
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:46,752
Left side!

93
00:06:46,777 --> 00:06:47,728
Nice receive!

94
00:06:49,901 --> 00:06:51,539
Smooth moves, Kageyama!

95
00:06:52,073 --> 00:06:52,888
Chance ball!

96
00:06:53,942 --> 00:06:56,208
Remember to use the full width of the court!

97
00:06:58,776 --> 00:07:00,714
The little punk's actually going to do it!

98
00:07:03,821 --> 00:07:05,441
A wide broad-jump!

99
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,201
Nice kill, Hinata!

100
00:07:19,805 --> 00:07:20,612
Dammit.

101
00:07:22,613 --> 00:07:24,371
The duo's back together.

102
00:07:25,561 --> 00:07:27,877
I can't let those two stay on the court!

103
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:33,485
Nice, Makki!

104
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:34,190
Yeah!

105
00:07:34,336 --> 00:07:36,528
I wish the rotation would move faster!

106
00:07:38,897 --> 00:07:41,733
I need the shorty to move to the back as soon as possible!

107
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:44,504
Got it!

108
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:49,331
Wow, the ball never hits the floor... How cool.

109
00:07:50,414 --> 00:07:51,094
Got it...!

110
00:07:52,273 --> 00:07:52,960
Again?!

111
00:07:53,511 --> 00:07:55,196
Use the whole court!

112
00:08:02,896 --> 00:08:04,553
That little guy's awesome.

113
00:08:04,578 --> 00:08:05,682
It's volleyball...

114
00:08:05,707 --> 00:08:08,306
And this game's all about nonstop jumping...

115
00:08:08,633 --> 00:08:10,510
It's like you're fighting against gravity.

116
00:08:11,161 --> 00:08:12,396
Jump to decoy.

117
00:08:12,796 --> 00:08:13,882
Jump to block.

118
00:08:14,489 --> 00:08:15,669
Jump to spike.

119
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:18,042
Hey, nice cover!

120
00:08:18,576 --> 00:08:20,334
The longer the rally goes...

121
00:08:20,447 --> 00:08:21,609
Go to the back!

122
00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:24,243
The more frantic and uneasy the players become.

123
00:08:24,268 --> 00:08:24,764
Let's stop the next one!

124
00:08:24,789 --> 00:08:25,984
When you get tired,

125
00:08:26,361 --> 00:08:27,828
it makes you slack off.

126
00:08:28,449 --> 00:08:32,204
I remember in one match, I even
wished someone else would spike for me.

127
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:36,918
Oh yeah, there was this one rally that
went on forever and I was totally worn out.

128
00:08:37,431 --> 00:08:38,510
It got to the point

129
00:08:38,535 --> 00:08:42,040
I didn't even care where the ball
went anymore. I just wanted it to fall.

130
00:08:42,065 --> 00:08:44,710
Bring it to me!

131
00:08:46,998 --> 00:08:50,311
If I slow down for even a second, I'll never catch up!

132
00:08:51,028 --> 00:08:56,628
And with my height, if I let up on my jumping
power, that big tall wall's gonna shut me right out!

133
00:08:58,682 --> 00:09:00,342
That's why I have to keep running!

134
00:09:00,621 --> 00:09:03,964
And keep jumping! I want to stay in the court!

135
00:09:04,245 --> 00:09:08,316
You won't hit unmarked... No way!

136
00:09:10,661 --> 00:09:13,783
Now! Take advantage of the entire width of the court!

137
00:09:14,474 --> 00:09:15,214
And then...

138
00:09:18,276 --> 00:09:19,700
Break through the center!

139
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:20,348
Yeah!

140
00:09:23,849 --> 00:09:25,401
Now that's a pipe!

141
00:09:25,501 --> 00:09:27,030
That was a great kill!

142
00:09:27,055 --> 00:09:29,059
Hinataaaaaaa!

143
00:09:29,504 --> 00:09:30,265
Damn!

144
00:09:30,584 --> 00:09:33,033
Sorry... I let 'em trick me.

145
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:37,601
I knew the timing was perfect to pull off a pipe...

146
00:09:38,868 --> 00:09:43,570
And yet... I almost handed it to Hinata just now!

147
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,906
He nearly took the toss away from me!

148
00:09:49,707 --> 00:09:51,796
He is the greatest decoy.

149
00:09:52,787 --> 00:09:54,401
Karasuno caught up.

150
00:09:54,426 --> 00:09:55,219
They're tied.

151
00:09:56,056 --> 00:09:57,176
I'll get the towels.

152
00:09:57,201 --> 00:09:57,923
Thank you.

153
00:09:58,724 --> 00:09:59,394
Thanks.

154
00:10:05,628 --> 00:10:08,468
The rallies are longer than
they were in the first two sets.

155
00:10:08,842 --> 00:10:09,993
I'm sure it's tough.

156
00:10:10,386 --> 00:10:11,021
Still...

157
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:15,973
seems nice.

158
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:20,727
What's the plan? That broad jump's no joke.

159
00:10:25,665 --> 00:10:27,459
It's a simple move.

160
00:10:29,915 --> 00:10:31,508
Just shut him down.

161
00:10:50,734 --> 00:10:51,074
Boom!

162
00:10:51,099 --> 00:10:52,314
Yeah, nice kill!

163
00:10:53,242 --> 00:10:55,131
Hinata's about to be in the back row.

164
00:10:56,506 --> 00:10:58,525
Hey! You're doing okay, right?!

165
00:10:58,808 --> 00:11:00,852
Uh... Yeah, I'm good!

166
00:11:01,477 --> 00:11:04,214
Score as much as you can before you move back.

167
00:11:04,474 --> 00:11:05,419
You got it!

168
00:11:05,825 --> 00:11:06,812
Nice receive!

169
00:11:06,837 --> 00:11:07,560
Kindaichi!

170
00:11:07,591 --> 00:11:08,547
Number 12!

171
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,637
Nice job, Nishinoya!

172
00:11:12,049 --> 00:11:12,562
Now!

173
00:11:12,587 --> 00:11:14,285
Whoa! Another broad-jump?

174
00:11:15,219 --> 00:11:15,945
Is he...?

175
00:11:18,027 --> 00:11:21,099
He's unmarked! Th-they're not blocking anymore!

176
00:11:21,484 --> 00:11:23,680
There ya go! Hit it unmarked!

177
00:11:28,292 --> 00:11:29,107
Bring it.

178
00:11:30,727 --> 00:11:31,862
Nice try.

179
00:11:33,517 --> 00:11:34,808
Nice, Watari!

180
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:36,181
They planned that!

181
00:11:36,239 --> 00:11:40,055
That was quick! They just switched
up their game in no time at all!

182
00:11:45,253 --> 00:11:47,187
A setter dump, really?!

183
00:11:47,418 --> 00:11:51,278
They confused us for a second...
just so they could sneak that in!

184
00:11:52,602 --> 00:11:54,917
Let's nip that broad-jump in the bud.

185
00:11:54,942 --> 00:11:56,845
Yeah but how do we do that, Coach?

186
00:11:57,219 --> 00:12:00,144
Well, the shorty's broad-jump may be insanely fast...

187
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:03,763
But I suspect he has a tendency
to get caught up in the momentum...

188
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:06,854
which limits the accuracy of its placement, right?

189
00:12:09,237 --> 00:12:12,784
Instead of blocking, I say we
counter their broad-jump using digs.

190
00:12:12,823 --> 00:12:13,292
Right!

191
00:12:13,642 --> 00:12:17,810
Good point, but if we can't make the block work,
then it's only gonna get in the way of our receive.

192
00:12:18,089 --> 00:12:23,107
No matter how difficult it gets out there, don't ever
stop thinking or get out of tune with your teammates!

193
00:12:23,132 --> 00:12:24,253
Nice receive!

194
00:12:25,021 --> 00:12:27,894
Shouldn't his broad-jump be enough to throw them off?

195
00:12:28,823 --> 00:12:31,753
Just when we really can't afford
for them to hit their groove...

196
00:12:31,937 --> 00:12:33,670
He's up to serve again.

197
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,792
Just one point.

198
00:12:38,817 --> 00:12:39,206
Yep!

199
00:12:39,231 --> 00:12:41,682
Oooooooolé.

200
00:12:44,755 --> 00:12:47,349
Inside the net! That boy is lucky!

201
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:50,355
There was no stoppin' that! Just keep goin'!

202
00:12:51,105 --> 00:12:53,307
Damn, another 2-point buffer.

203
00:12:53,477 --> 00:12:54,439
Stay calm...

204
00:12:54,808 --> 00:12:58,917
Oooooooolé.

205
00:13:01,196 --> 00:13:01,963
Cover!

206
00:13:02,242 --> 00:13:03,621
Okay, right here!

207
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:05,554
Kageyama!

208
00:13:05,585 --> 00:13:06,954
Last hit, Asahi!

209
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:09,005
That was close!

210
00:13:09,218 --> 00:13:11,028
I can tell they're really nervous!

211
00:13:15,823 --> 00:13:18,987
Whoa... I bet that's really stressful!

212
00:13:19,241 --> 00:13:22,825
One way to gain the flow is to
control a long rally like this,

213
00:13:23,545 --> 00:13:26,239
and this one's high-stakes.. Let's watch.

214
00:13:29,118 --> 00:13:29,905
Cover it!

215
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:33,210
You won't get this point and
you will not control the flow!

216
00:13:33,235 --> 00:13:34,695
It's still in play!

217
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,514
Yeah, But who's gettin' the last hit?!

218
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:38,899
Center!

219
00:13:38,924 --> 00:13:40,818
Hinata! It's all you!

220
00:13:41,258 --> 00:13:43,023
Hinataaaaaaaa!

221
00:13:43,048 --> 00:13:44,983
Block him!

222
00:13:49,892 --> 00:13:52,023
Yeah!

223
00:13:54,196 --> 00:13:55,070
Uh-oh...

224
00:13:55,163 --> 00:13:58,045
Now Karasuno's already used up both of their time-outs.

225
00:13:58,070 --> 00:13:59,549
What choice did they have?

226
00:14:00,071 --> 00:14:04,905
If they hadn't called a time-out to physically
cut off the flow, Seijoh would've run away with it!

227
00:14:05,464 --> 00:14:08,718
There must be something we can
do to change the momentum here.

228
00:14:08,956 --> 00:14:12,342
We don't need anything fancy, I just want one good play.

229
00:14:12,599 --> 00:14:15,644
Something that'll clear the
air and get us on the right track!

230
00:14:25,766 --> 00:14:29,002
Whew, Seijoh touched the net! That was a lucky break.

231
00:14:29,027 --> 00:14:29,816
Yeah...

232
00:14:30,665 --> 00:14:31,420
Perfect.

233
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,233
The shorty's in the back row now.

234
00:14:35,072 --> 00:14:38,148
If we screw up.. They'll be over 20 points!

235
00:14:38,187 --> 00:14:42,130
And if they take the momentum, we'll
never catch up! Please make Seijoh screw up!

236
00:14:42,417 --> 00:14:44,418
Hey, man... y'seein' this?

237
00:14:47,349 --> 00:14:48,342
What the-?!

238
00:14:49,302 --> 00:14:51,523
Tadashi is their pinch server?!

239
00:14:53,602 --> 00:15:00,136
Has Keishin completely lost his mind?! That's never
gonna work! The best that kid can manage is a fluke!

240
00:15:00,397 --> 00:15:02,862
Well, maybe a fluke is what he's hoping for.

241
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:03,544
Huh?

242
00:15:04,239 --> 00:15:08,685
You never know, something as simple as that
might be all you need to shift the momentum.

243
00:15:10,405 --> 00:15:11,702
That's their guy?

244
00:15:11,727 --> 00:15:13,812
You guys think he's actually
a good server? Or did they just

245
00:15:13,837 --> 00:15:16,498
throw him in the game to shake things up a little?

246
00:15:16,678 --> 00:15:18,517
Either way, it's not gonna fly.

247
00:15:20,412 --> 00:15:24,087
I hope you do good... But not as good as I can do!

248
00:15:25,326 --> 00:15:27,888
He can't even stand being out for a second.

249
00:15:28,017 --> 00:15:30,959
Tadashi! Turn the tide for us!

250
00:15:30,992 --> 00:15:32,076
O-Okay!

251
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:34,704
This is it.

252
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,854
Beyond this line is a different world!

253
00:15:44,785 --> 00:15:47,820
Wow, it's even a different temperature!

254
00:15:51,834 --> 00:15:54,415
Hey, this is your time to shine, Tadashi!

255
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,209
Yeah!

256
00:15:55,234 --> 00:15:56,882
Just do your best, Tadashi!

257
00:15:57,146 --> 00:15:58,213
Yeah, good luck.

258
00:15:58,238 --> 00:16:01,220
Uh, don't worry, just relax and take it easy out there!

259
00:16:01,245 --> 00:16:03,160
You should take your own advice, Asahi.

260
00:16:04,015 --> 00:16:06,942
Jeez, being thrown in now would make anybody panic!

261
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:12,015
His first high school game and his first
serve, all at once?! Is Coach some sorta sick-o?!

262
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:15,907
Man, this is stressing me out!
But I can't let Tadashi see that...

263
00:16:16,321 --> 00:16:19,040
At least he won't hit me in the head like Hinata.

264
00:16:19,065 --> 00:16:22,656
This seems kinda risky... I
mean things are already so tense...

265
00:16:22,744 --> 00:16:25,680
I bet he's feeling bad being
put in before the upperclassmen.

266
00:16:26,234 --> 00:16:27,215
Yeah, you're right.

267
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:30,622
Hey, Tadashi!

268
00:16:31,762 --> 00:16:35,286
You're great! Good luck! Woo!

269
00:16:47,428 --> 00:16:49,754
Oh, boy... This isn't lookin' good.

270
00:16:49,794 --> 00:16:50,910
I don't blame him.

271
00:16:51,483 --> 00:16:56,412
In a team-orientated game like volleyball,
serving is the only time you're ever truly alone.

272
00:16:56,714 --> 00:16:59,554
All eyes are on you. The pressure's unbelievable.

273
00:17:00,528 --> 00:17:01,718
I'm scared, but...

274
00:17:04,256 --> 00:17:05,681
No matter who you are...

275
00:17:05,834 --> 00:17:10,084
the moment you step into that serve
position, you become the star of the game!

276
00:17:13,597 --> 00:17:16,389
This is your chance to prove yourself, Tadashi!

277
00:17:21,855 --> 00:17:23,169
A jump float?!

278
00:17:25,526 --> 00:17:26,888
Come on...!

279
00:17:39,909 --> 00:17:43,762
Go, go Seijoh! Go, go Seijoh! Geeeet thaaaaat point!

280
00:17:43,787 --> 00:17:45,359
Well then... that's that.

281
00:17:45,874 --> 00:17:47,453
I-I'm sorry.

282
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:48,826
Hey It's alright.

283
00:17:48,893 --> 00:17:50,184
Yeah.. Don't sweat it, bro.

284
00:17:50,209 --> 00:17:50,917
You're good.

285
00:17:53,691 --> 00:17:54,784
I'm sorry.

286
00:17:54,936 --> 00:17:55,644
Nah.

287
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:57,815
There is no need to apologize.

288
00:17:58,018 --> 00:17:59,601
Let it go... Move on.

289
00:18:01,045 --> 00:18:01,825
Tadashi!

290
00:18:03,448 --> 00:18:04,835
S-Sorry, Daichi!

291
00:18:04,975 --> 00:18:06,785
Next time... You'll get it.

292
00:18:09,952 --> 00:18:10,868
Next time...?

293
00:18:11,966 --> 00:18:12,568
Right!

294
00:18:17,561 --> 00:18:19,876
Karasuno's mood just shifted.

295
00:18:20,177 --> 00:18:23,922
That's Daichi for ya... Always knows just what to say.

296
00:18:24,515 --> 00:18:28,170
Wow... For some reason I don't
feel stressed out at all now.

297
00:18:28,372 --> 00:18:29,408
Yeah, me neither.

298
00:18:29,881 --> 00:18:34,330
Weird... They brought that guy in and then
kicked him right back out as soon as he messed up.

299
00:18:34,432 --> 00:18:36,170
I kinda feel sorry for him.

300
00:18:36,489 --> 00:18:39,116
That's the point of using a pinch server like that.

301
00:18:39,555 --> 00:18:44,141
That point was huge because it wasn't just the
flow but the whole team's pride was riding on it.

302
00:18:44,812 --> 00:18:46,505
And Tadashi couldn't cut it.

303
00:18:47,351 --> 00:18:47,991
One point!

304
00:18:48,016 --> 00:18:51,968
But this was a chance for him to develop
a frustration with his own powerlessness.

305
00:18:52,222 --> 00:18:54,247
And that's enough to make anyone stronger.

306
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:55,916
Boom!

307
00:18:57,262 --> 00:18:58,372
Get some!

308
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:01,321
The buzz cut guy's pretty fired up now.

309
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,869
Oh yeah, I was noticing that myself.

310
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:08,136
That's my point. The smallest
thing can turn the game around.

311
00:19:09,415 --> 00:19:12,880
The prize for winning this game is the chance to play...

312
00:19:13,832 --> 00:19:14,712
again!

313
00:19:14,999 --> 00:19:17,705
Yeah! Let's keep it goin', you guys!

314
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:22,498
It's like we're chasing after Seijoh,
but they're just barely out of reach.

315
00:19:22,838 --> 00:19:26,509
Unless we can use the break to
score, we're dead men walking.

316
00:19:30,376 --> 00:19:32,768
Their accuracy's dropping with their energy.

317
00:19:33,289 --> 00:19:34,083
Kunimi!

318
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:37,640
That's advanced.

319
00:19:37,665 --> 00:19:39,218
This is really dragging out...

320
00:19:42,588 --> 00:19:43,686
That was out...

321
00:19:43,711 --> 00:19:44,510
My bad!

322
00:19:44,663 --> 00:19:49,729
Seijoh! Seijoh! Geeeeet thaaaat point!

323
00:19:49,754 --> 00:19:50,411
Woo!

324
00:19:50,617 --> 00:19:53,159
Come on... Get that break!

325
00:19:58,630 --> 00:19:59,267
Leave it!

326
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:00,434
Good eye!

327
00:20:04,165 --> 00:20:05,396
Good, good!

328
00:20:05,421 --> 00:20:07,489
Give us another one! Back-to-back!

329
00:20:11,068 --> 00:20:12,835
I cannot let it hit the floor!

330
00:20:15,092 --> 00:20:17,239
Did he seriously use his foot?!

331
00:20:23,172 --> 00:20:23,847
There we go!

332
00:20:23,871 --> 00:20:24,924
Ow... Ooh.

333
00:20:25,176 --> 00:20:27,062
Nice one, Red!

334
00:20:30,787 --> 00:20:32,185
You're up, Kageyama!

335
00:20:32,426 --> 00:20:33,484
One more...

336
00:20:37,991 --> 00:20:38,936
Here you go!

337
00:20:40,849 --> 00:20:41,996
Whoa, Daichi!

338
00:20:42,384 --> 00:20:44,195
I'm not losing this game!

339
00:20:44,706 --> 00:20:46,438
I'm not losing this game!

340
00:20:46,565 --> 00:20:48,232
I'm not losin' this game!

341
00:20:48,257 --> 00:20:49,841
I'm not losing.

342
00:20:52,531 --> 00:20:53,094
But...

343
00:20:54,785 --> 00:20:55,853
Gotcha!

344
00:20:55,952 --> 00:20:57,872
I'm sure they feel the same way.

345
00:21:02,186 --> 00:21:04,015
I cannot believe this...

346
00:21:05,032 --> 00:21:06,365
They got match point!

347
00:21:07,986 --> 00:21:13,962
One more point! One more point!
One more point! One more point!

348
00:21:14,843 --> 00:21:17,495
Hey! Don't wimp out now!

349
00:21:17,802 --> 00:21:19,502
Let's give it all we got!

350
00:21:27,438 --> 00:21:30,722
Whoo! Now that's a kill, Asahi!

351
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:32,671
Let 'er rip, Tanaka!

352
00:21:32,696 --> 00:21:33,071
One point!

353
00:21:33,096 --> 00:21:33,922
Give it to 'em!

354
00:21:34,841 --> 00:21:37,144
If I flub this serve, it's game over...

355
00:21:37,887 --> 00:21:40,810
And if they receive and make a
strong attack, we're done for!

356
00:21:44,774 --> 00:21:47,293
They're gonna quick attack! Don't let it fall!

357
00:21:47,866 --> 00:21:48,766
At least...

358
00:21:50,316 --> 00:21:51,032
touch it!

359
00:21:53,543 --> 00:21:54,449
Oh, crap!

360
00:21:55,002 --> 00:21:57,795
It's going over! They're gonna go for a direct!

361
00:22:05,596 --> 00:22:07,243
A one-handed set?!

362
00:23:59,053 --> 00:24:01,715
Wow, you two really are going the extra mile!

363
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:02,394
Thanks!

364
00:24:02,419 --> 00:24:04,328
24-24. That's deuce.

365
00:24:04,353 --> 00:24:05,801
First team to score two points wins.

366
00:24:05,826 --> 00:24:07,672
And that's gonna be us, right?

367
00:24:07,697 --> 00:24:09,263
Yeah!

368
00:24:09,558 --> 00:24:12,299
Next Haikyu!! "Lonely King No More".
