1
00:00:05,773 --> 00:00:07,987
Kay! See ya later!

2
00:00:08,133 --> 00:00:09,703
Bye Shoyo...

3
00:00:19,941 --> 00:00:21,685
We play Nekoma in four days.

4
00:00:22,862 --> 00:00:24,298
And I've got new allies!

5
00:00:24,761 --> 00:00:28,212
That spiker... and that receiver are both on my side!

6
00:00:29,871 --> 00:00:31,059
This'll be great!

7
00:00:31,909 --> 00:00:34,404
I'd better hurry... It's time for training camp!

8
00:00:34,498 --> 00:00:36,478
Ah-hahaaa!

9
00:02:12,003 --> 00:02:16,265
Mister Hinata... need a bathroom break? You can go.

10
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:21,239
Everybody here?

11
00:02:21,596 --> 00:02:22,529
Yes sir!

12
00:02:22,992 --> 00:02:25,940
We've got four days until the
practice game against Nekoma,

13
00:02:25,965 --> 00:02:29,130
and after that, it'll be time
for the Inter-High preliminaries.

14
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:33,099
Time is short... but we've
got a whole lot of stuff to fix.

15
00:02:33,124 --> 00:02:36,530
If you sad sacks expect to win,
there's only one thing we can do.

16
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:40,295
Practice, practice, practice.

17
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:43,373
I want you to keep retrieving 'til you puke!

18
00:02:43,398 --> 00:02:44,496
Right!

19
00:02:44,829 --> 00:02:46,968
Well, that means Hinata's done his job.

20
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:49,767
Forward!

21
00:02:52,748 --> 00:02:57,154
Hey! How many times are you gonna
let me score on you?! Get serious!

22
00:02:57,824 --> 00:02:58,728
One more!

23
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:00,159
Get ready!

24
00:03:00,969 --> 00:03:01,436
Nice receive!

25
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:02,265
Good job!

26
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,768
That's five for him...

27
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:05,054
Time to switch out.

28
00:03:05,146 --> 00:03:05,672
Next!

29
00:03:05,697 --> 00:03:07,141
I'm ready whenever you are!

30
00:03:12,295 --> 00:03:15,133
Good. Alright now let's work on a few spikes!

31
00:03:15,158 --> 00:03:16,056
Right!

32
00:03:19,716 --> 00:03:20,522
Nice kill!

33
00:03:22,316 --> 00:03:22,592
Nice kill!

34
00:03:22,616 --> 00:03:23,873
Way to go, guys!

35
00:03:26,163 --> 00:03:27,360
Whoaaaa!

36
00:03:30,092 --> 00:03:31,802
Yeaaah!

37
00:03:32,727 --> 00:03:34,298
Those spikes are lookin' good, guys!

38
00:03:34,323 --> 00:03:34,711
Huh?

39
00:03:36,885 --> 00:03:38,532
Um... do you mind if I go next?

40
00:03:38,557 --> 00:03:39,945
Oh! Sure!

41
00:03:44,652 --> 00:03:46,650
Alright... let's pack it up guys.

42
00:03:46,798 --> 00:03:47,875
Yes sir!

43
00:03:49,758 --> 00:03:53,373
Uh? Wow! So this is training camp!

44
00:03:58,771 --> 00:04:00,462
Is it really all that exciting?

45
00:04:00,487 --> 00:04:03,081
Of course it is! I've never been to a training camp!

46
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,076
It's just a bunch of loud, disgusting
guys in your face all day every day...

47
00:04:07,101 --> 00:04:07,967
What's so fun about that?

48
00:04:07,992 --> 00:04:09,415
You take that back right now!

49
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:14,220
Yeah, any place within a quarter-mile radius of our
gorgeous Kiyoko is automatically pure and beautiful!

50
00:04:14,245 --> 00:04:16,832
This air's as fresh as a morning in spring!

51
00:04:16,857 --> 00:04:21,142
And if your senses are so dull you
can't smell it, I feel sorry for you!

52
00:04:21,167 --> 00:04:22,753
Kiyoko lives right by here...

53
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:24,891
She goes home whenever the day's over.

54
00:04:30,566 --> 00:04:32,232
Should I even ask what you're doing?

55
00:04:33,061 --> 00:04:36,755
Take... we can't go on... Goodbye sweet world!

56
00:04:36,779 --> 00:04:37,224
Ah?!

57
00:04:37,248 --> 00:04:37,803
Ah?

58
00:04:41,435 --> 00:04:42,035
Huh?

59
00:04:48,652 --> 00:04:50,718
Thanks for the fooo-oood!

60
00:04:53,611 --> 00:04:55,372
Does anybody want seconds?

61
00:04:55,473 --> 00:04:57,218
Yes please, Kiyoko!

62
00:04:57,958 --> 00:04:58,633
Wow.

63
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:05,032
Okay... the bath's open for the first-years now.

64
00:05:05,539 --> 00:05:05,968
Hm?

65
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:08,539
What's wrong, Hinata?

66
00:05:10,767 --> 00:05:11,502
Hey.

67
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:13,854
There's somebody here...

68
00:05:14,506 --> 00:05:15,721
It's a stranger.

69
00:05:18,407 --> 00:05:21,408
Whatever... don't be ridiculous.

70
00:05:22,006 --> 00:05:23,212
We're the only ones here-

71
00:05:23,428 --> 00:05:23,981
It's...

72
00:05:25,099 --> 00:05:26,097
a child.

73
00:05:29,076 --> 00:05:31,125
Nah... You're seeing things...

74
00:05:31,404 --> 00:05:34,667
I'm sure you just walked past a
mirror and saw your reflection.

75
00:05:35,749 --> 00:05:40,261
Yeah, you're right. That'd be silly... it's nothing.

76
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:45,322
Uh-huh. You've gotta be uh... Just imagining things...

77
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:57,065
Huh?

78
00:05:57,192 --> 00:06:00,830
Uh what's with all the racket?
Daichi's gonna get angry y'know.

79
00:06:02,486 --> 00:06:04,271
It's just Noya, you idiot.

80
00:06:04,818 --> 00:06:08,107
Whoa... it is him! But he shrank...

81
00:06:08,258 --> 00:06:10,046
Maybe the ghosts made him shorter!

82
00:06:13,173 --> 00:06:16,220
Is that why you have spiky
hair, so you look tall?! Bahaha!

83
00:06:16,271 --> 00:06:18,079
Dammit, Tanakaaa!

84
00:06:18,409 --> 00:06:20,399
Don't make fun of me or I swear-

85
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:23,953
You should keep your voices down. Daichi might hear you-

86
00:06:25,498 --> 00:06:27,957
Huh. Guys, it's just me, Asahi!

87
00:06:27,982 --> 00:06:31,457
All of you, shut up! Shut up!

88
00:06:34,836 --> 00:06:36,433
What are you, a windmill?

89
00:06:36,727 --> 00:06:38,697
Move your hands and your feet!

90
00:06:38,722 --> 00:06:40,435
Yes sir! One more!

91
00:06:43,515 --> 00:06:44,516
Nice, Hinata!

92
00:06:44,727 --> 00:06:45,953
That's his fifth one.

93
00:06:46,431 --> 00:06:48,057
Good, that should be everybody.

94
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,269
Time to run some laps, guys!

95
00:06:50,411 --> 00:06:51,638
Yes sir!

96
00:06:51,957 --> 00:06:52,478
Pick up the pace dude.

97
00:06:52,502 --> 00:06:53,918
They sure are full of energy.

98
00:06:54,313 --> 00:06:56,016
They even practice during lunch.

99
00:06:56,269 --> 00:06:59,957
Yeah, I noticed that too...
Kageyama gets started early doesn't he?

100
00:07:00,158 --> 00:07:02,851
Right... and Hinata's been doing the same thing...

101
00:07:02,876 --> 00:07:06,688
He said he needs to do that here since he's
not going over the mountains like he used to.

102
00:07:06,713 --> 00:07:07,832
The mountains, huh?

103
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:10,538
That would explain all that stamina.

104
00:07:12,207 --> 00:07:13,529
On a different note...

105
00:07:14,321 --> 00:07:16,695
Are you having some trouble choosing the starters?

106
00:07:17,495 --> 00:07:19,018
Well just the setter...

107
00:07:19,945 --> 00:07:20,916
I'm stuck.

108
00:07:21,586 --> 00:07:24,286
If we're talking raw power, it's gotta be Kageyama...

109
00:07:24,881 --> 00:07:30,038
Now you've got Sugawara who's built up experience from
playing alongside the ace ever since his first year...

110
00:07:31,063 --> 00:07:36,073
But still, Kageyama's got more than enough
talent right out of the gate to make up for all that.

111
00:07:37,337 --> 00:07:40,195
Then again, Sugawara's been around for a while...

112
00:07:40,872 --> 00:07:43,901
So he's probably already got the trust of his teammates.

113
00:07:44,816 --> 00:07:47,181
But that's not really the heart of the issue, is it?

114
00:07:47,324 --> 00:07:48,502
So could it be that...

115
00:07:49,111 --> 00:07:52,417
You're having trouble deciding
because Sugawara's a third-year?

116
00:07:53,779 --> 00:07:55,778
Your last year in high school is special.

117
00:07:56,486 --> 00:07:59,064
I can see why you would want to take that into account.

118
00:07:59,702 --> 00:08:02,500
Ah! I'm sorry! I think I'm overstepping...

119
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:04,835
No, you're probably right.

120
00:08:05,901 --> 00:08:12,185
You know... when I was in high school, the only time I got
to be in the starting lineup was when the official setter

121
00:08:12,257 --> 00:08:14,065
who was younger than me, got hurt.

122
00:08:15,324 --> 00:08:19,590
Back then, I was just angry that I never
got the opportunity for three whole years...

123
00:08:20,646 --> 00:08:23,852
But now... as a coach, even a temporary one...

124
00:08:24,733 --> 00:08:28,049
I shouldn't be thinking like a player. It's not right.

125
00:08:35,266 --> 00:08:39,643
Hinata! Stop yelling like a madman. You're
gonna need to save that energy for the game!

126
00:08:39,668 --> 00:08:41,357
Whoa, where are you going?!

127
00:08:45,838 --> 00:08:46,310
Huh?

128
00:08:49,082 --> 00:08:53,219
Nobody's back there. Is this path... the wrong way?

129
00:08:55,143 --> 00:08:55,678
Huh?

130
00:09:01,715 --> 00:09:04,773
A red uniform? What school is that from?

131
00:09:05,627 --> 00:09:06,576
Hey, whatcha up to?

132
00:09:08,842 --> 00:09:12,320
Well, it's just... Uh... I'm lost.

133
00:09:12,345 --> 00:09:14,496
You're lost? Are you from out of town?

134
00:09:15,111 --> 00:09:15,786
Mm-hm.

135
00:09:17,651 --> 00:09:18,865
Is that a fun game?

136
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:20,933
Uh... not really...

137
00:09:21,052 --> 00:09:23,038
I'm uh just trying to pass the time.

138
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:24,384
Oh...

139
00:09:27,281 --> 00:09:29,735
Hey! Do you play too?!

140
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,356
Huh?

141
00:09:30,425 --> 00:09:31,816
Those volleyball shoes!

142
00:09:31,841 --> 00:09:32,802
In your bag!

143
00:09:32,911 --> 00:09:34,429
Oh. Yeah.

144
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:38,292
Shoyo Hinata! So... What's your name?

145
00:09:40,097 --> 00:09:40,842
Kozume.

146
00:09:41,072 --> 00:09:43,200
Kozume? Is that your first name?

147
00:09:43,893 --> 00:09:44,781
No, it's...

148
00:09:47,532 --> 00:09:48,390
It's Kenma.

149
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,784
So are you... In high school?

150
00:09:50,808 --> 00:09:51,351
Yeah.

151
00:09:51,503 --> 00:09:53,484
What's your year? I'm a first-year!

152
00:09:53,763 --> 00:09:54,268
Second.

153
00:09:54,293 --> 00:09:57,389
Oh crap, so you're my upperclassman! I'm so sorry!

154
00:09:57,558 --> 00:10:03,414
It's okay... after all... that age-based
hierarchy stuff that comes with sports... it's lame.

155
00:10:03,439 --> 00:10:04,791
Oh... you think?

156
00:10:07,203 --> 00:10:09,540
Uh, so, do you like volleyball?

157
00:10:09,565 --> 00:10:13,176
Eh... it's fine... I can't say I really care.

158
00:10:13,725 --> 00:10:17,333
I don't mind it or anything... But
I'm not big on getting all worn out.

159
00:10:18,497 --> 00:10:21,074
But uh... my friend likes to play...

160
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:23,973
And he needs me... So I play too.

161
00:10:24,243 --> 00:10:28,827
Oh. Well once you get used to it...
I'm sure you'll like volleyball too.

162
00:10:28,891 --> 00:10:32,269
Whatever... I'm only playing it while I'm in high school.

163
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,923
Yeah, what position?

164
00:10:34,031 --> 00:10:34,752
Uh...

165
00:10:35,268 --> 00:10:35,988
I'm a setter.

166
00:10:36,013 --> 00:10:39,570
Really?! You're a lot different than the setter we've got.

167
00:10:39,754 --> 00:10:43,323
He's really growly and scary
like a saber-tooth tiger! Grr...

168
00:10:43,348 --> 00:10:43,839
Oh.

169
00:10:44,719 --> 00:10:46,904
I'm a middle blocker by the way!

170
00:10:47,321 --> 00:10:47,914
Cool.

171
00:10:49,713 --> 00:10:52,561
Oh... but you probably think that's a little weird...

172
00:10:52,965 --> 00:10:55,507
Shorter guys don't usually play that position.

173
00:10:55,858 --> 00:10:59,933
Nah, I don't think that's weird... not at all.

174
00:11:00,845 --> 00:11:03,969
People say a lot of stuff about
me whenever I go to a game, too.

175
00:11:04,171 --> 00:11:08,904
You know, things like, "I thought the setter was supposed
to be the team member with the strongest abilities...

176
00:11:09,042 --> 00:11:11,786
So why did they ever pick this guy of all people?"

177
00:11:12,163 --> 00:11:15,412
You see... I'm not all that much of an athletic person.

178
00:11:15,886 --> 00:11:19,890
Oh... so does your school have
a good volleyball team or what?

179
00:11:20,253 --> 00:11:25,347
Hmm... I don't know... Apparently it
used to be good and then it went downhill.

180
00:11:26,532 --> 00:11:27,780
But as of recently...

181
00:11:29,304 --> 00:11:31,185
I would say, it's pretty good.

182
00:11:38,511 --> 00:11:40,098
Hang on... what school is-

183
00:11:40,123 --> 00:11:41,144
Hey Kenma!

184
00:11:41,396 --> 00:11:41,841
Ah.

185
00:11:42,432 --> 00:11:43,043
Kuroo.

186
00:11:44,973 --> 00:11:45,641
Gotta go.

187
00:11:47,436 --> 00:11:49,057
Later... okay?

188
00:11:50,239 --> 00:11:51,544
You shouldn't wander off.

189
00:11:51,943 --> 00:11:52,658
Sorry.

190
00:11:52,967 --> 00:11:54,610
You don't know your way around here.

191
00:11:55,268 --> 00:11:55,929
Later?

192
00:11:59,413 --> 00:12:01,380
Ah! Hey Hinata!

193
00:12:02,038 --> 00:12:03,731
We were looking all over for you.

194
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:07,218
Sorry Suga! I didn't realize I went the wrong way.

195
00:12:08,472 --> 00:12:11,611
You always give it your all, no
matter what kind of practice we're doing.

196
00:12:12,108 --> 00:12:15,552
Yeah. But I've still got a really long way to go.

197
00:12:15,905 --> 00:12:16,412
Huh?

198
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,510
There's a lot of things I need to improve on.

199
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:25,356
I mean, yeah, it kinda gets on my nerves that no one
sees me as anything but half of a pair with Kageyama...

200
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,448
But it's better than not playing at all, right?

201
00:12:27,754 --> 00:12:30,421
I want to stay on the court the longest.

202
00:12:32,658 --> 00:12:33,263
Huh?

203
00:12:35,706 --> 00:12:39,197
So do I. All I want is to play volleyball...

204
00:12:39,433 --> 00:12:42,383
That's why... I do whatever it takes to be my best.

205
00:12:43,552 --> 00:12:46,516
C'mon... don't want to be late for lunch!

206
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:47,230
Yeah!

207
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:53,683
Wow... Nekoma's setter's not very tall.

208
00:12:54,408 --> 00:12:57,644
Oh yeah... he sure does look pretty scrawny, doesn't he?

209
00:12:57,692 --> 00:12:59,789
Maybe that's just the backup setter?

210
00:12:59,814 --> 00:13:02,071
Beats me, I don't know a thing about these guys.

211
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:07,287
That short scrawny guy you
seem to be so concerned about...

212
00:13:07,311 --> 00:13:07,735
Huh?

213
00:13:07,823 --> 00:13:11,628
He just happens to be the
spine... the brain... and heart...

214
00:13:12,178 --> 00:13:13,218
of our team.

215
00:13:36,847 --> 00:13:37,786
Uh, coach?

216
00:13:38,612 --> 00:13:40,113
Hm? What's up?

217
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:43,973
Us third-years... we don't get a next season.

218
00:13:45,121 --> 00:13:47,616
That's why I want us to win as many games as we can...

219
00:13:48,222 --> 00:13:49,877
So we get more chances to play.

220
00:13:50,432 --> 00:13:50,838
Uh?

221
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:54,271
And if Kageyama has a better
likelihood of making that happen for us...

222
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:57,648
Well then I think you shouldn't hesitate to put him in.

223
00:13:59,654 --> 00:14:02,883
Daichi and Asahi have been playing
together since their first year.

224
00:14:03,533 --> 00:14:07,490
I want to stand on the court with
them. And the more plays the better.

225
00:14:08,252 --> 00:14:13,632
It's okay if I only get to fill in, like if Kageyama gets
tired or something happens to put him out or whatever.

226
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,501
You might pity me for being set aside for a first year...

227
00:14:18,244 --> 00:14:21,989
But as long as I keep having a
chance to play... that's fine.

228
00:14:23,197 --> 00:14:27,209
Even if I don't get to be the official
setter, I'll never give up on volleyball...

229
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:30,569
I just want to be the best part of the team I can.

230
00:14:31,844 --> 00:14:32,352
Mm.

231
00:14:32,891 --> 00:14:33,489
Sorry...

232
00:14:33,737 --> 00:14:35,370
If I'm overstepping my bounds.

233
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:37,329
Sugawara.

234
00:14:37,353 --> 00:14:37,690
Huh?

235
00:14:38,877 --> 00:14:40,874
I think I might've underestimated you.

236
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:44,361
Honestly, you're kinda freaking me out right now.

237
00:14:44,602 --> 00:14:45,151
What?

238
00:14:46,104 --> 00:14:48,057
I don't have any coaching experience...

239
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:52,966
But I swear I'll do whatever I can...
to keep you guys on the winning track.

240
00:14:55,314 --> 00:14:56,280
Thank you, sir!

241
00:14:56,453 --> 00:14:57,084
Sure.

242
00:14:58,429 --> 00:15:01,175
Let's go for the win... I think we can do this.

243
00:15:01,517 --> 00:15:02,089
Yeah.

244
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,201
Time to eat!

245
00:15:06,569 --> 00:15:09,204
Jeez, slow it down... You're gonna get sick.

246
00:15:09,322 --> 00:15:09,884
Ugh...

247
00:15:10,067 --> 00:15:12,652
Don't stop eating! Force it down if you have to!

248
00:15:12,862 --> 00:15:13,958
How can you get through the summer if you don't eat?!

249
00:15:13,983 --> 00:15:16,443
You've got a big appetite today. Suga.

250
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:18,492
Yeah, maybe so...

251
00:15:19,229 --> 00:15:19,920
Are you gonna eat that? I'll take it!

252
00:15:19,944 --> 00:15:21,054
Gotta stay strong!

253
00:15:21,079 --> 00:15:23,817
No! Tadashi needs to eat his own dinner!

254
00:15:37,556 --> 00:15:38,191
Listen up.

255
00:15:38,878 --> 00:15:40,525
Here's our starting order for Nekoma.

256
00:15:47,154 --> 00:15:49,400
I know you haven't had much time to get acquainted...

257
00:15:49,665 --> 00:15:52,023
So I don't expect any of you to be perfect.

258
00:15:53,013 --> 00:15:58,252
Just because we've got a hotshot libero and our
ace just came back doesn't mean victory is a safe bet.

259
00:15:58,882 --> 00:16:00,865
The winner keeps the ball in play.

260
00:16:00,953 --> 00:16:06,361
So let's see how far this team can take it,
those damn pussycats are not gonna know what hit 'em!

261
00:16:06,529 --> 00:16:07,522
Yeah!

262
00:16:12,044 --> 00:16:12,854
Asahi!

263
00:16:16,832 --> 00:16:18,327
Just forget about Suga...

264
00:16:18,825 --> 00:16:21,770
Ennoshita's the guy you should
really be feeling sorry for here.

265
00:16:21,795 --> 00:16:22,738
What? Me?!

266
00:16:24,169 --> 00:16:27,577
He's a wing spiker just like you! It must suck to be him!

267
00:16:28,855 --> 00:16:30,539
Hey um... Asahi?

268
00:16:30,564 --> 00:16:31,024
Uh?

269
00:16:31,299 --> 00:16:34,710
It's fine... I haven't always been devoted to the sport.

270
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:38,372
I ran away from the game once... I get it.

271
00:16:38,725 --> 00:16:41,448
You just wait. He's gonna
become way stronger than you are.

272
00:16:41,473 --> 00:16:46,193
He just needs time. Then he will have the
regular position! C'mon tell him, Ennoshita!

273
00:16:46,549 --> 00:16:47,686
Please don't speak for me-uhh...

274
00:16:47,711 --> 00:16:51,350
Oh wait, nevermind, he would actually have to
take over Tanaka's position first, wouldn't he?

275
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:53,435
So you're comin' after my spot, are ya?

276
00:16:53,745 --> 00:16:55,932
I'd like to see you try, you little bastard!

277
00:16:55,957 --> 00:16:58,781
Whoa! I didn't say it, Nishinoya did!

278
00:17:03,505 --> 00:17:06,956
There we go... hey uh... Ennoshita?

279
00:17:07,528 --> 00:17:07,918
Hm?

280
00:17:07,954 --> 00:17:09,148
About what you said...

281
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:11,756
Oh... about how chose to leave the game?

282
00:17:13,502 --> 00:17:17,372
You heard about the old coach Ukai
coming out of retirement last year, right?

283
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:18,122
Yeah.

284
00:17:18,331 --> 00:17:20,348
It's a bit embarrassing for us to admit,

285
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:24,951
but a bunch of us had some trouble adjusting
to his, let's say "hardcore" training methods.

286
00:17:25,475 --> 00:17:30,785
We'd been doing volleyball club just to have fun, and
then suddenly it was all about winning and nothing else.

287
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:34,581
We felt like our space had been
invaded, and it kinda scared us away.

288
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:37,265
But then we really missed playing volleyball...

289
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:41,461
And when we came back... Well
coach Ukai had already taken off.

290
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:45,475
The thing is... we're not as cool as you are.

291
00:17:45,705 --> 00:17:51,019
But now that we're all here... We promise to
work just as hard as the rest of the team...

292
00:17:51,255 --> 00:17:53,022
So let's do our best, okay?

293
00:17:54,861 --> 00:17:55,512
Right!

294
00:18:03,555 --> 00:18:04,017
Sir?

295
00:18:04,042 --> 00:18:06,432
Hm? Oh, are they ready?

296
00:18:06,547 --> 00:18:08,816
Yes... alterations are finished...

297
00:18:08,899 --> 00:18:11,217
And they've been cleaned. Here you go.

298
00:18:11,987 --> 00:18:13,402
Whoaaa!

299
00:18:14,095 --> 00:18:15,705
Just like I saw on TV!

300
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:17,944
Oh?

301
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:21,202
Hey! Why's Noya the only one with an orange one?

302
00:18:21,227 --> 00:18:24,538
Because I'm the star! Jeez,
shouldn't that be obvious by now?

303
00:18:24,563 --> 00:18:26,773
The star? Cooooool!

304
00:18:26,798 --> 00:18:31,005
The libero wears a different color Jersey because
he goes on and off of the court during a game,

305
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:34,062
so it makes it easier to keep track of him... dumbass.

306
00:18:34,087 --> 00:18:37,642
I-I knew that! Everyone knows that! Uh?

307
00:18:42,022 --> 00:18:44,368
Hey... his is one number higher than mine!

308
00:18:44,393 --> 00:18:45,830
I knew you'd say that.

309
00:18:46,174 --> 00:18:49,406
We're only first-years. You should
be happy we get uniforms at all.

310
00:18:49,431 --> 00:18:51,001
Uh... I know that too!

311
00:18:51,096 --> 00:18:52,297
Heh, that's funny...

312
00:18:52,748 --> 00:18:54,569
I guess he doesn't remember the number.

313
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:56,805
He only saw him on TV one time.

314
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:57,325
Huh?

315
00:18:58,346 --> 00:19:01,325
When the tiny giant played in the nationals, his number...

316
00:19:01,602 --> 00:19:02,449
Was 10.

317
00:19:08,085 --> 00:19:10,182
Wow, coach, did you plan this just for me?!

318
00:19:10,229 --> 00:19:11,527
No, settle down, ginger.

319
00:19:11,552 --> 00:19:12,930
It must be destiny!

320
00:19:12,955 --> 00:19:14,240
Or a coincidence.

321
00:19:14,265 --> 00:19:16,059
Aw, don't be jealous, okay?

322
00:19:16,084 --> 00:19:18,036
Why would I be jealous of you?!

323
00:19:18,095 --> 00:19:24,957
Here's the thing. When Hinata's hero, the tiny giant,
was on the team, Karasuno was the best it's ever been.

324
00:19:25,981 --> 00:19:29,295
But in spite of that, we didn't
win against Nekoma even once.

325
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:33,162
It ended in a losing streak. So let's turn that around.

326
00:19:33,344 --> 00:19:34,226
Yeah!

327
00:19:34,662 --> 00:19:37,343
Alright! You better get your asses back to practice!

328
00:19:37,368 --> 00:19:38,247
Yes sir!

329
00:19:39,443 --> 00:19:41,527
I guess Nekoma must have a really good team.

330
00:19:42,023 --> 00:19:43,651
So what all do you know about them?

331
00:19:43,676 --> 00:19:46,135
I don't really have a clue what they're like these days...

332
00:19:46,322 --> 00:19:49,096
But that team has always had some talented receivers.

333
00:19:49,476 --> 00:19:52,522
They didn't have stand-out
players, but their defense was tight.

334
00:19:52,974 --> 00:19:54,667
The opposite of us, I guess.

335
00:19:55,324 --> 00:19:58,178
And that whole "cat" thing... It makes sense.

336
00:19:58,777 --> 00:20:00,235
They're extremely agile.

337
00:20:01,787 --> 00:20:02,708
What the heck?

338
00:20:02,756 --> 00:20:06,179
No matter how many times I hit it, I
can't get it to fall into their court!

339
00:20:15,086 --> 00:20:16,366
I don't understand...

340
00:20:16,406 --> 00:20:19,100
They don't have any superstar guys on their team...

341
00:20:19,289 --> 00:20:20,831
So what's their secret?

342
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,049
Here's the most important issue...

343
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:32,149
Do they or do they not have a female manager?

344
00:20:32,317 --> 00:20:34,889
My Yakisoba bun is saying no!

345
00:20:35,114 --> 00:20:38,823
Huh? But don't you want them to have one? I say yes.

346
00:20:38,847 --> 00:20:39,986
Yeah, I agree.

347
00:20:40,011 --> 00:20:44,722
You crazy?! We don't have a girl manager,
so I'm just gonna be pissed off if they do!

348
00:20:44,747 --> 00:20:45,559
Huh?

349
00:20:46,233 --> 00:20:50,121
Or what if it's worse? She
could be a girl and extremely hot!

350
00:20:50,146 --> 00:20:54,169
I would never forgive those stupid jerks for that! Never!

351
00:20:54,607 --> 00:20:57,472
You'll pay for having a babe for a manager, Karasuno!

352
00:20:57,511 --> 00:20:59,197
Give it a rest, Yamamoto!

353
00:20:59,543 --> 00:21:01,608
Hey! What's Kenma think?

354
00:21:03,325 --> 00:21:05,082
Does it uh... Really even matter?

355
00:21:05,107 --> 00:21:07,233
Humph... I knew you would say that.

356
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:07,934
But...

357
00:21:08,189 --> 00:21:08,638
Humph?

358
00:21:09,002 --> 00:21:11,181
I do kinda look forward to playing them...

359
00:21:11,412 --> 00:21:12,641
You know, a little bit.

360
00:21:12,892 --> 00:21:13,392
Huh?

361
00:21:14,268 --> 00:21:19,115
Huh? Whoa! Since when are you looking forward
to anything, Mr. couldn't-care-less Kenma Kozume?!

362
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:22,600
If you're that fired up, maybe I
should make you do some extra reps.

363
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,796
N-no, that's okay...

364
00:21:37,748 --> 00:21:41,153
Hey, Hinata... They said the
first-years can hit the bath now.

365
00:21:43,734 --> 00:21:46,393
Seriously? Are you about to throw up again?

366
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,277
What?! Of course I'm not!

367
00:21:49,388 --> 00:21:50,631
I was just thinking...

368
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,988
They're all preparing for the match...

369
00:21:53,147 --> 00:21:54,459
Even if they're not playing.

370
00:21:56,138 --> 00:21:59,492
The only reason the coach put me
in the game is because of your sets.

371
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:04,942
I hate to say this, but if not for
you, I probably wouldn't be in the lineup.

372
00:22:07,773 --> 00:22:09,091
I'm going in first!

373
00:22:09,531 --> 00:22:10,357
Hey!

374
00:22:10,382 --> 00:22:12,532
You got a head start, you little cheater!

375
00:22:14,195 --> 00:22:18,505
Even going to the bathroom's a
competition... Those guys're morons.

376
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:21,167
I'm getting tired just watching them.

377
00:22:22,484 --> 00:22:24,055
Hey! Quit screwing around!

378
00:24:13,726 --> 00:24:15,655
It's time for our game against Nekoma.

379
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:19,395
Great, I can't wait to play against the
school for guys with weird-shaped heads.

380
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:21,014
Haha! Did you see those clowns?

381
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:22,904
Yeah, well at least they're not very tall.

382
00:24:22,928 --> 00:24:24,341
Neither are you, short stuff.

383
00:24:24,419 --> 00:24:27,162
Next Haikyu!! "The cat and crow reunion."
