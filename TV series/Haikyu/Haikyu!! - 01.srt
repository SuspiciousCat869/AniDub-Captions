1
00:00:13,284 --> 00:00:17,250
There's an enormous wall in front of me, blocking my way.

2
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,813
I can only wonder what's on the other side?

3
00:00:26,394 --> 00:00:27,730
What does it look like?

4
00:00:30,186 --> 00:00:33,434
Is it the view from the summit?

5
00:00:34,587 --> 00:00:36,486
I'll never be able to see it on my own.

6
00:00:37,711 --> 00:00:40,959
But if I have others on my side...

7
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:45,050
Thank you!

8
00:02:18,737 --> 00:02:20,400
Good morning! Come on in!

9
00:02:24,328 --> 00:02:24,637
Eh?

10
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:46,803
Alright! He did it! That's five
points in a row for Karasuno High.

11
00:02:46,828 --> 00:02:49,450
In the spring high school
national volleyball championship.

12
00:02:49,585 --> 00:02:52,343
He might be surrounded by players as tall as 6 foot 2.

13
00:02:52,391 --> 00:02:56,684
But that does not stop Karasuno's
tiny giant from making a huge impact.

14
00:02:57,128 --> 00:03:00,548
Oh, Karasuno, the next town over... they're not half bad.

15
00:03:00,573 --> 00:03:03,492
Hmph! Hurry up, Hinata, we're gonna lose our soccer field!

16
00:03:04,087 --> 00:03:04,973
Karasuno...

17
00:03:13,608 --> 00:03:15,380
Hinata, slow down!

18
00:03:20,604 --> 00:03:22,031
It's huge.

19
00:03:24,893 --> 00:03:26,930
It smells like air salonpas.

20
00:03:27,103 --> 00:03:29,910
Don't say stuff like that, Hinata... it's dorky.

21
00:03:29,935 --> 00:03:31,455
Yeah, don't be that guy.

22
00:03:31,486 --> 00:03:34,727
But guys, this is my very first real volleyball game!

23
00:03:35,786 --> 00:03:37,587
I've waited 3 long years for this!

24
00:03:37,612 --> 00:03:40,493
That's true, I guess it is kind
of amazing that we made it this far.

25
00:03:40,518 --> 00:03:42,440
Two and three and...

26
00:03:48,988 --> 00:03:53,259
Izumin, Koji... thanks for coming to help our team out.

27
00:03:54,097 --> 00:03:55,422
Don't make it weird!

28
00:03:55,447 --> 00:03:58,490
Our game was the first one to
finish. No need to make it a big deal.

29
00:03:58,530 --> 00:03:59,927
You too, first-years!

30
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:03,836
I'm so thankful you three decided to
join the volleyball club with me this season!

31
00:04:03,861 --> 00:04:07,041
Uh, sure... we're pretty terrible
at this whole thing, but okay.

32
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,532
Spare us the tears, Shoyo.

33
00:04:08,557 --> 00:04:09,678
I'm not crying!

34
00:04:09,787 --> 00:04:11,502
You've got tears in your eyes.

35
00:04:11,527 --> 00:04:13,632
Um, I'm sorry to interrupt...

36
00:04:13,704 --> 00:04:13,886
Huh?

37
00:04:13,911 --> 00:04:15,572
But we should really warm up now.

38
00:04:15,771 --> 00:04:17,747
Come on, captain, you're in charge here.

39
00:04:17,772 --> 00:04:18,935
He's right, Shoyo!

40
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:22,959
You're the one who dragged us into this tournament thing,
and you still haven't explained what all the rules are!

41
00:04:22,984 --> 00:04:24,326
Uh! I know that!

42
00:04:24,985 --> 00:04:29,004
Even though we barely made the cut...
we're here to win this! Okay, guys?

43
00:04:29,065 --> 00:04:32,013
We can't win with a thrown together team of rookies!

44
00:04:32,182 --> 00:04:33,210
Sure we can!

45
00:04:33,443 --> 00:04:35,421
Kitagawa first might be tough though.

46
00:04:36,018 --> 00:04:38,494
Maybe... but I'll beat 'em anyway!

47
00:04:41,995 --> 00:04:44,650
Uh? Ah... gyahhh!

48
00:04:44,768 --> 00:04:45,811
Excuse us!

49
00:04:45,836 --> 00:04:46,801
Move, dude!

50
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:48,122
Uh...

51
00:04:49,887 --> 00:04:51,049
They're tall!

52
00:04:52,835 --> 00:04:53,652
Huh?!

53
00:05:01,387 --> 00:05:04,211
Kita go! Kita go!

54
00:05:05,466 --> 00:05:07,435
Hey, Kitagawa first is here.

55
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:08,753
They're huge.

56
00:05:08,778 --> 00:05:10,495
Those guys scare the hell outta me.

57
00:05:10,614 --> 00:05:12,312
They're the best team around here.

58
00:05:12,702 --> 00:05:13,838
They've got the king.

59
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:14,910
The king?

60
00:05:14,935 --> 00:05:16,034
What? You don't know?

61
00:05:16,229 --> 00:05:18,242
That's what they call Tobio Kageyama.

62
00:05:18,267 --> 00:05:20,933
He's a setter. And he's supposed to be awesome.

63
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:24,222
Tch! Dammit, we're going to going
up against these freakin' guys.

64
00:05:24,247 --> 00:05:27,802
It'll be fine! I don't care how big
they are. I'll bust right through 'em!

65
00:05:27,978 --> 00:05:30,719
Maybe you're right, Hinata. You are a really good jumper!

66
00:05:30,744 --> 00:05:31,812
You've got this!

67
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:37,001
Uh... Wonder where the... bathrooms are...

68
00:05:40,719 --> 00:05:43,386
Have you guys even heard of Yukigaoka Middle School?

69
00:05:43,522 --> 00:05:46,992
No, but the whole team looks pretty
shrimpy, and they don't even have a libero.

70
00:05:47,142 --> 00:05:50,394
This'll be a piece of cake...
I almost feel a little guilty.

71
00:05:50,435 --> 00:05:51,103
You three!

72
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:56,066
You better not get all cocky...

73
00:05:57,004 --> 00:06:01,457
Because as soon as my tummy stops being upset, I
am gonna wipe the floor with you jerks out there...

74
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:02,696
Do you hear me?

75
00:06:02,807 --> 00:06:03,475
Uhhh...

76
00:06:06,644 --> 00:06:08,105
I can't wait to see that!

77
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:09,569
He needs his mommy!

78
00:06:09,594 --> 00:06:11,482
Look, he's wearing the captain's mark too!

79
00:06:11,507 --> 00:06:13,490
Ugh, they're making fun of me!

80
00:06:14,183 --> 00:06:15,754
Hey... second-years.

81
00:06:20,686 --> 00:06:23,788
The official warm-up's about to start... get moving.

82
00:06:23,866 --> 00:06:25,438
Yes sir! On our way!

83
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:27,148
Whatever you say, Kageyama!

84
00:06:31,784 --> 00:06:33,819
Hurry up, man. We need to fill two more!

85
00:06:34,007 --> 00:06:36,600
The game won't last long enough to drink all those...

86
00:06:36,633 --> 00:06:37,669
Not against them.

87
00:06:37,694 --> 00:06:38,081
Gah!

88
00:06:38,113 --> 00:06:39,922
Hah! Yeah, good point!

89
00:06:39,995 --> 00:06:41,037
What did you say?!

90
00:06:41,062 --> 00:06:42,062
Look, you three.

91
00:06:43,217 --> 00:06:44,800
You're not even warming the bench yet.

92
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,842
You think you have the right
to look down on the competition?

93
00:06:48,961 --> 00:06:51,790
You can't hide behind our school's reputation.

94
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:53,930
W-we're sorry!

95
00:06:54,624 --> 00:06:57,218
Whoa... uh!

96
00:06:57,298 --> 00:07:00,963
Thanks, bro. I was about to tell
those losers off myself, but whatever...

97
00:07:02,575 --> 00:07:06,174
They were making fun of you because you
can't even handle a little stomachache...

98
00:07:06,207 --> 00:07:08,007
You have no right to run your mouth.

99
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,470
Huh... hey!

100
00:07:09,697 --> 00:07:11,838
Why did you come to this tournament anyway?

101
00:07:11,872 --> 00:07:13,372
Just for fun or what?

102
00:07:13,985 --> 00:07:16,183
What? No way, I came to win!

103
00:07:17,569 --> 00:07:19,685
You make winning sound so easy.

104
00:07:21,852 --> 00:07:24,866
I know I'm not very tall... but...

105
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:25,511
Huh?

106
00:07:25,974 --> 00:07:27,117
I can still jump!

107
00:07:27,933 --> 00:07:28,664
Hm...

108
00:07:29,418 --> 00:07:32,712
As long as you don't give up trying,
there's always a chance at victory!

109
00:07:32,808 --> 00:07:35,410
Yeah, well not giving up is easier said than done!

110
00:07:37,703 --> 00:07:43,107
Look, today's the day I finally get to
play volleyball on a real court with 6 players.

111
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:48,248
So I'm gonna win the first round, then
the second, and every match after that!

112
00:07:48,569 --> 00:07:51,115
And not just in this tournament, but all of them!

113
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:58,887
From the first round, to the second,
the final, all the way to nationals...

114
00:08:00,614 --> 00:08:03,399
I'm going to be the one standing
in the winner's court, got it!

115
00:08:08,377 --> 00:08:08,909
Hmph!

116
00:08:15,311 --> 00:08:16,216
What's your deal?!

117
00:08:16,241 --> 00:08:17,224
Oh, Izumin.

118
00:08:17,601 --> 00:08:20,441
I thought you went to the bathroom,
why were you picking a fight with him?

119
00:08:21,047 --> 00:08:21,785
We should get back!

120
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:23,333
Aren't you sick? Hey!

121
00:08:23,358 --> 00:08:23,950
Nope!

122
00:08:23,974 --> 00:08:24,993
Dude...

123
00:08:29,232 --> 00:08:30,945
Man, they're pretty good.

124
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:31,374
Oh?

125
00:08:31,925 --> 00:08:34,111
So that scary guy must be their setter.

126
00:08:34,777 --> 00:08:39,188
I think that's Kageyama, the one they were
calling king of the court or whatever, right?

127
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:41,084
Anyway, remind me what a setter is?

128
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:45,084
That's the position that hits the ball
up first... We just learned that yesterday!

129
00:08:45,117 --> 00:08:46,173
Oh, did we?

130
00:08:48,187 --> 00:08:49,806
Your timing is too slow...

131
00:08:50,085 --> 00:08:52,198
A quick attack should be faster than that!

132
00:08:52,394 --> 00:08:53,212
Sorry.

133
00:08:54,223 --> 00:08:55,145
Kageyama...

134
00:08:55,202 --> 00:08:55,686
Hm?

135
00:08:55,776 --> 00:08:57,778
You shouldn't be obsessing over speed...

136
00:08:57,836 --> 00:09:02,570
It isn't about your personal technique, it's about how
well you're able to set up the ball for the spiker to hit.

137
00:09:02,595 --> 00:09:03,598
You understand?

138
00:09:03,903 --> 00:09:04,728
Yes sir.

139
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:17,177
This is finally happening!

140
00:09:17,744 --> 00:09:18,894
Time to start!

141
00:09:20,374 --> 00:09:22,405
The other team's kinda scrawny, huh?

142
00:09:23,088 --> 00:09:25,734
Koji! I want you to show me your back number, okay?

143
00:09:25,828 --> 00:09:26,330
What?

144
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:30,269
Koji!

145
00:09:30,689 --> 00:09:31,184
Gah!

146
00:09:32,809 --> 00:09:33,533
I'm sorry.

147
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:35,363
Nah, don't worry about it!

148
00:09:35,727 --> 00:09:36,668
You got this!

149
00:09:39,383 --> 00:09:42,085
Man, those poor kids aren't ever gonna score a point.

150
00:09:42,131 --> 00:09:43,877
Well, at least we'll be done a little sooner.

151
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:46,295
Yeah, I've got some shows to watch. Uh?

152
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,975
There's no reason to beat yourself up!

153
00:09:48,075 --> 00:09:49,617
Just try harder next time.

154
00:09:49,903 --> 00:09:52,312
Uh.. Yeah! This time I'll nail it!

155
00:09:52,337 --> 00:09:53,812
I've worked too hard to get here...

156
00:09:54,924 --> 00:09:56,900
I'm not gonna let it end that easily!

157
00:09:59,074 --> 00:10:02,527
Huh? I'm... the only club member?

158
00:10:02,812 --> 00:10:05,510
Oh yeah, the numbers go down every year.

159
00:10:05,535 --> 00:10:09,300
And so you know, our boys' volleyball
is just a fan club. It's not a real team.

160
00:10:09,325 --> 00:10:10,266
Okay...

161
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:14,613
So what do you want to do then? You can pick a
different club, or I can put you in girls' volleyball.

162
00:10:14,638 --> 00:10:18,495
Hm? Uh.. That's not gonna work... I can do it by myself!

163
00:10:18,888 --> 00:10:19,568
If you want.

164
00:10:19,593 --> 00:10:21,262
I'll be the next tiny giant!

165
00:10:21,393 --> 00:10:22,816
Huh? Tiny what?

166
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,165
Nice serve!

167
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:33,147
Nice receive!

168
00:10:34,923 --> 00:10:35,434
Gyah!

169
00:10:38,441 --> 00:10:39,034
Got it!

170
00:10:43,477 --> 00:10:46,049
Circle up! Okay, let's go for a run.

171
00:10:46,292 --> 00:10:46,899
'Kay!

172
00:10:47,623 --> 00:10:48,326
Perfect!

173
00:10:48,702 --> 00:10:49,104
So, that happened.

174
00:10:49,129 --> 00:10:50,735
You're on a break, right, Izumin?

175
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,219
Set me up for some spikes!

176
00:10:52,496 --> 00:10:53,634
Why would I do that?

177
00:10:53,673 --> 00:10:55,764
I just wanna see if I can hit a good spike!

178
00:10:55,789 --> 00:10:57,488
No way dude, I don't even know how.

179
00:10:57,513 --> 00:10:59,694
All you have to do is throw it so I can hit it!

180
00:10:59,719 --> 00:11:01,254
I can't, okay? The upperclassmen are watching.

181
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:02,135
Over here!

182
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,104
Oh? Okay, one sec!

183
00:11:11,772 --> 00:11:15,820
'Sup, Hinata? I heard you joined the
girls' volleyball team. What's up with that?

184
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:17,506
Man, you're such a player!

185
00:11:17,932 --> 00:11:18,854
It's not like that!

186
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:20,402
So which girl you after?

187
00:11:20,427 --> 00:11:23,005
There's a lot of smokin' hot third-years on the team.

188
00:11:24,075 --> 00:11:26,086
Well, yeah some of them are cute, but...

189
00:11:26,111 --> 00:11:26,897
Awww yeah!

190
00:11:26,922 --> 00:11:29,524
Shut up, you guys! I'm on the boys' team, okay?!

191
00:11:36,689 --> 00:11:41,038
You know... you sure practice a lot for
someone who never actually gets to play.

192
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:44,109
Hey! I'll get to play one day. Just wait and see!

193
00:11:45,013 --> 00:11:48,845
Everybody turns me down now, but I'm
gonna get a whole bunch of guys to play!

194
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,332
If you say so.

195
00:11:50,719 --> 00:11:51,610
Hey, Koji!

196
00:11:51,819 --> 00:11:53,954
For the last time, not happening.

197
00:12:02,898 --> 00:12:04,229
Hey, Izumin!

198
00:12:04,409 --> 00:12:05,152
You got a second?

199
00:12:05,193 --> 00:12:07,033
Sorry, I've got an exam to cram!

200
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:13,190
Aw, man...

201
00:12:14,005 --> 00:12:14,787
It's okay!

202
00:12:20,103 --> 00:12:20,961
Hey! Heads up!

203
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,447
Hm?

204
00:12:23,821 --> 00:12:25,614
Shoyo! Are you okay?

205
00:12:25,882 --> 00:12:26,862
Ow...

206
00:12:27,564 --> 00:12:28,731
My bad, dude.

207
00:12:29,778 --> 00:12:31,534
Could you set for me real quick?

208
00:12:34,488 --> 00:12:35,428
This time, I'll...

209
00:12:35,992 --> 00:12:37,493
Koji! Izumin!

210
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:41,432
Hey, can we stop now?

211
00:12:41,805 --> 00:12:44,604
My arms hurt and I can't seem to aim the ball that well...

212
00:12:44,698 --> 00:12:45,812
This is getting old.

213
00:12:46,228 --> 00:12:48,029
Just one more try, I promise!

214
00:12:48,104 --> 00:12:50,021
I'll get some first-years to join me soon!

215
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:54,612
But you just said one more a few minutes
ago... This is the last one for real, okay?

216
00:12:54,644 --> 00:12:55,441
Thank you!

217
00:12:55,888 --> 00:12:56,497
Ready?

218
00:12:58,387 --> 00:12:59,443
Oh... oops...

219
00:13:06,462 --> 00:13:07,570
It's all you, Hina!

220
00:13:08,514 --> 00:13:12,302
I may be on the short side, but
I can jump high to make up for it.

221
00:13:12,441 --> 00:13:13,806
Higher than any wall!

222
00:13:19,868 --> 00:13:20,504
Yes!

223
00:13:20,727 --> 00:13:21,881
Shake it off, Hinata!

224
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,365
Uh?

225
00:13:22,506 --> 00:13:24,326
I'll throw you another one, okay?

226
00:13:24,597 --> 00:13:25,669
S-sorry!

227
00:13:25,982 --> 00:13:28,005
Man, that should've been my shot.

228
00:13:28,999 --> 00:13:30,166
I'll get the next one.

229
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:53,731
Sweet!

230
00:13:53,756 --> 00:13:56,610
Wow... their number 5 doesn't mess around. Does he?

231
00:13:56,900 --> 00:14:00,229
Well, at least Yukigaoka's scoring
a few points in the second set...

232
00:14:00,364 --> 00:14:01,384
That's a little better

233
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:03,499
those are all the other team's errors though.

234
00:14:03,524 --> 00:14:04,227
Here goes!

235
00:14:04,252 --> 00:14:04,751
Huh?

236
00:14:05,256 --> 00:14:05,910
Gotcha!

237
00:14:07,969 --> 00:14:10,875
The wall! I can't see the other side!

238
00:14:13,298 --> 00:14:16,264
Man... it's like they're anticipating their every move.

239
00:14:16,455 --> 00:14:18,538
And the short guy can really jump too.

240
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:20,507
Hang in there, dude. You'll get the next one.

241
00:14:20,532 --> 00:14:21,978
That's right! We got this!

242
00:14:26,588 --> 00:14:28,111
Phew! That was close!

243
00:14:28,312 --> 00:14:29,621
Pick up the pace!

244
00:14:30,712 --> 00:14:31,503
Nice.

245
00:14:31,553 --> 00:14:34,611
Yeah... the captain's doing those crazy sets again though.

246
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:39,436
What's the deal? The other team doesn't
even have any defense. Why's he going all out?

247
00:14:39,983 --> 00:14:43,390
The real question is why aren't
you guys taking this game seriously?!

248
00:14:43,423 --> 00:14:45,302
Dude, chill! It's not the time!

249
00:14:45,327 --> 00:14:46,445
Check that out...

250
00:14:46,502 --> 00:14:49,970
The setter for Kita first is really
good at what he does and all, but...

251
00:14:50,621 --> 00:14:52,719
It's almost like he's playing by himself.

252
00:14:55,406 --> 00:14:56,061
Got it!

253
00:14:56,315 --> 00:14:56,823
Huh?

254
00:14:57,178 --> 00:14:58,665
Looks like that's gonna be a service ace!

255
00:14:58,714 --> 00:14:59,292
Not yet!

256
00:14:59,501 --> 00:15:00,786
He'll never hit that.

257
00:15:00,872 --> 00:15:02,994
It's not over until the ball hits the ground...

258
00:15:07,682 --> 00:15:09,041
Ah! You okay?!

259
00:15:09,153 --> 00:15:11,067
Man, that's gotta hurt.

260
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:12,221
He's a tough one.

261
00:15:12,809 --> 00:15:15,638
If Kita gets one more point, then this thing is all over.

262
00:15:15,799 --> 00:15:16,697
Uh-huh.

263
00:15:16,764 --> 00:15:17,931
Man...

264
00:15:18,939 --> 00:15:20,998
Sorry... that was my fault.

265
00:15:21,098 --> 00:15:22,747
Nah, I'll get the next one!

266
00:15:22,817 --> 00:15:23,436
Look!

267
00:15:23,461 --> 00:15:24,009
Huh?

268
00:15:24,137 --> 00:15:27,171
Um... you almost got hurt just now.

269
00:15:27,428 --> 00:15:28,148
But we're never gonna beat these guys.

270
00:15:28,173 --> 00:15:29,408
Almost over!

271
00:15:29,769 --> 00:15:31,205
Why are you trying so hard?

272
00:15:33,101 --> 00:15:34,174
Kita go! Kita go!

273
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:35,904
Huh? Uh... I'm sorry...

274
00:15:36,344 --> 00:15:38,723
I don't really understand what you're asking me.

275
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43,233
But it's... not over.

276
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:48,044
He's right, it's simple...

277
00:15:48,592 --> 00:15:52,697
No matter how tricky the ball is,
there's still a reason to go after it.

278
00:15:54,154 --> 00:15:54,869
Koji!

279
00:15:55,227 --> 00:15:57,078
The ball hasn't hit the floor yet.

280
00:15:58,422 --> 00:16:02,766
No matter how bad the odds are,
there's always a reason to keep playing.

281
00:16:04,813 --> 00:16:07,309
Because we haven't lost yet!

282
00:16:08,285 --> 00:16:08,970
One-touch!

283
00:16:08,995 --> 00:16:10,192
Cover it, get back!

284
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:13,223
I'll never make it in time.

285
00:16:15,483 --> 00:16:17,438
Aw yeah!

286
00:16:20,796 --> 00:16:22,494
Why didn't you run for it?

287
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:27,037
Uh, sorry.

288
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:30,835
Don't ever let your guard down, don't
stop playing until the game is over.

289
00:16:30,891 --> 00:16:35,496
Yeah, I understand that but... It would take a
miracle for them to catch up to us at this point.

290
00:16:35,529 --> 00:16:39,026
The point they scored was no miracle... it was stolen.

291
00:16:40,857 --> 00:16:44,286
By that kid! Right there! He stole our point!

292
00:16:44,897 --> 00:16:45,950
Uh, okay...

293
00:16:45,975 --> 00:16:46,401
Right, let's get another one!

294
00:16:46,426 --> 00:16:48,729
I mean, you're not wrong, but come on, dude...

295
00:16:54,606 --> 00:16:56,022
Inside the net! Front, front!

296
00:16:56,094 --> 00:16:56,927
Izumi, I'm free!

297
00:16:56,952 --> 00:17:00,228
As long as you don't give up trying,
there's always a chance at victory!

298
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:05,109
A miss hit? It didn't count as a dribble...

299
00:17:05,398 --> 00:17:06,997
But nobody's covering over there.

300
00:17:13,629 --> 00:17:16,153
No, he went left!

301
00:17:16,591 --> 00:17:18,955
I swear I had my eye on him!

302
00:17:19,896 --> 00:17:20,888
So how...

303
00:17:22,699 --> 00:17:24,369
How is he over here?!

304
00:17:28,293 --> 00:17:29,110
Hinata!

305
00:17:29,907 --> 00:17:31,081
Are you okay, kid?

306
00:17:34,168 --> 00:17:35,197
It was out?

307
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:42,754
That looked like it hurt...

308
00:17:42,786 --> 00:17:44,659
I could barely keep track of him.

309
00:17:46,099 --> 00:17:47,749
That was the setter's mistake.

310
00:17:48,404 --> 00:17:50,511
There's no way he could have anticipated it.

311
00:17:51,489 --> 00:17:53,161
How did he hit that?

312
00:17:54,025 --> 00:17:58,195
Is it even possible for a person to react that quickly?

313
00:17:59,205 --> 00:18:01,437
Hinata, let's line up.

314
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:04,508
Athletic ability... reflexes...

315
00:18:04,931 --> 00:18:12,447
A sense of control over his body... And most importantly,
determination to win. He may have all that, but...

316
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:17,133
What have you been wasting all
your time on for three years?!

317
00:18:18,998 --> 00:18:20,013
What did you say?!

318
00:18:20,038 --> 00:18:21,188
Koji, calm down!

319
00:18:21,213 --> 00:18:23,570
You don't know a damn thing about what Shoyo's been doing!

320
00:18:23,595 --> 00:18:25,673
You can't pick a fight in the middle of the court!

321
00:18:25,698 --> 00:18:26,522
Watch me!

322
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:30,981
My first and last real game in middle school.

323
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:32,842
Come on, Hinata, let's go.

324
00:18:32,937 --> 00:18:34,367
We lost every set.

325
00:18:35,201 --> 00:18:39,235
Start to finish, the game lasted only 31 minutes.

326
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:48,134
So that's the king of the court, huh?

327
00:18:49,017 --> 00:18:52,693
Uh-huh, he'll be a force to be
reckoned with when he gets to high school.

328
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:54,975
The short kid seems promising too.

329
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:12,090
Hey, we never stood a chance anyway. I heard
those guys are candidates for the nationals.

330
00:19:13,418 --> 00:19:15,535
I could go for some food right about now.

331
00:19:15,689 --> 00:19:17,759
Whatever. You're always hungry.

332
00:19:19,597 --> 00:19:21,852
No matter how good or bad each team is...

333
00:19:22,817 --> 00:19:28,431
In the end, it all comes down to winning or losing...
If you lose... then you have to step off the court.

334
00:19:34,738 --> 00:19:35,834
Hey, wait up!

335
00:19:35,859 --> 00:19:36,940
Hey! What's the rush?!

336
00:19:37,186 --> 00:19:37,908
Hold it!

337
00:19:38,003 --> 00:19:38,582
Hmm?

338
00:19:41,324 --> 00:19:43,882
You might be the king who rules the court for now...

339
00:19:48,589 --> 00:19:49,824
But I'm gonna win!

340
00:19:50,876 --> 00:19:53,848
One day I'm gonna stay in the court for longer than you!

341
00:20:00,087 --> 00:20:04,717
Only those who win get to stay
in the court... only the strongest.

342
00:20:05,385 --> 00:20:08,477
So if you want to keep playing,
then you have to become stronger.

343
00:20:22,487 --> 00:20:23,975
So what am I missing?

344
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:27,513
Thanks for everything!

345
00:20:29,207 --> 00:20:31,092
Dude... don't make it awkward!

346
00:20:31,386 --> 00:20:33,119
You don't have to thank us, alright?!

347
00:20:33,626 --> 00:20:35,684
Huh? What are you crying for?

348
00:20:35,796 --> 00:20:37,790
I'm not crying, okay?

349
00:21:23,619 --> 00:21:24,690
See ya, Shoyo!

350
00:21:24,805 --> 00:21:27,813
See you later! Bye! Woo! Hah!

351
00:21:35,223 --> 00:21:37,260
30 minutes over the hills by bike!

352
00:21:38,806 --> 00:21:42,224
It's my first day at Miyagi
Prefectural Karasuno High School.

353
00:21:43,209 --> 00:21:44,637
Hey, does any one want to join the soccer club?

354
00:21:44,662 --> 00:21:47,189
We need someone to manage the
baseball club. You interested?

355
00:21:47,214 --> 00:21:47,739
Huh?

356
00:21:48,805 --> 00:21:51,143
Here... these are all the current applicants.

357
00:21:51,279 --> 00:21:55,392
Thanks. Wow, that's not very many.
Didn't we used to get more of these?

358
00:21:55,417 --> 00:21:57,151
I'm sure we'll get more, Daichi.

359
00:21:57,213 --> 00:21:58,938
You're looking radiant today, Kiyoko!

360
00:22:00,207 --> 00:22:02,231
Gah... I love when she ignores me.

361
00:22:04,316 --> 00:22:06,842
Get ready, Karasuno, 'cause I'm here!

362
00:22:07,491 --> 00:22:09,224
I'm gonna practice like crazy!

363
00:22:10,685 --> 00:22:12,810
I'll challenge that king of the court guy...

364
00:22:14,253 --> 00:22:15,794
And get revenge!

365
00:22:27,317 --> 00:22:29,809
What?! You're here too?!

366
00:22:30,178 --> 00:22:30,743
Huh...

367
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:38,529
Omph!

368
00:22:40,266 --> 00:22:40,639
Ow.

369
00:24:13,716 --> 00:24:17,626
What's the king of the court doing at
this school?! Maybe it's somebody else?

370
00:24:17,726 --> 00:24:21,229
Yeah, that's it! Someone who looks just
like him... and happens to be in the gym...

371
00:24:21,254 --> 00:24:24,292
And happens to play volleyball... no way, get real!

372
00:24:24,316 --> 00:24:25,380
Next Haikyu:

373
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:27,436
"The volleyball club of Karasuno High."
