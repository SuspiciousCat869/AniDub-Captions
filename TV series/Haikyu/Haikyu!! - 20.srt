1
00:00:02,943 --> 00:00:05,612
When I started middle school, I met a great athlete.

2
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:12,010
Seeing him play made me think
middle school must be the big leagues.

3
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,376
But it wasn't middle school that was impressive.

4
00:00:17,595 --> 00:00:18,722
No, it was him.

5
00:00:20,679 --> 00:00:21,912
If I can surpass him...

6
00:00:23,136 --> 00:00:25,729
I'll be the best setter in the prefecture!

7
00:00:38,984 --> 00:00:41,086
Wow, check out Karasuno's setter.

8
00:00:41,272 --> 00:00:44,114
Most first-years can't stand up to Oikawa can they?

9
00:00:44,267 --> 00:00:47,113
Yeah, it's like clash of the Superstar Setters.

10
00:00:47,417 --> 00:00:50,199
That was sweet! You're just as good as the Great King!

11
00:00:50,224 --> 00:00:51,896
Pow! Pow! Pow! Pow! Pow! Pow!

12
00:00:51,921 --> 00:00:55,551
I swear... Even if I face someone who's better overall...

13
00:00:56,104 --> 00:00:57,684
I'm still the best setter.

14
00:00:58,803 --> 00:01:00,642
Doesn't matter, you're up to serve now.

15
00:01:01,232 --> 00:01:02,504
You'll be in the back...

16
00:01:02,787 --> 00:01:04,572
So you can't do it again, right?

17
00:01:05,104 --> 00:01:06,920
Setter dumps are illegal from there.

18
00:01:07,146 --> 00:01:07,880
I know!

19
00:01:08,106 --> 00:01:10,439
I'll do it when I'm up front again, alright?!

20
00:02:44,409 --> 00:02:45,942
Serve it up, Kageyama!

21
00:02:52,424 --> 00:02:53,132
Dammit!

22
00:02:53,445 --> 00:02:54,492
That's out.

23
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,735
He put some real strength behind that.

24
00:02:59,277 --> 00:03:01,747
Somebody sign him up for the baseball team.

25
00:03:03,495 --> 00:03:04,468
Let it go!

26
00:03:04,556 --> 00:03:05,509
I'm sorry!

27
00:03:06,786 --> 00:03:09,895
Well then. Shall I show you boys how it's done?

28
00:03:13,825 --> 00:03:17,809
Oooooooolé.

29
00:03:18,116 --> 00:03:19,417
He hit it right to him!

30
00:03:20,405 --> 00:03:23,416
Straight on... Nope, curve.

31
00:03:26,505 --> 00:03:28,677
He just controlled an Oikawa serve!

32
00:03:28,702 --> 00:03:30,516
That libero's incredible!

33
00:03:30,805 --> 00:03:33,607
Aw... that's no fair!

34
00:03:33,632 --> 00:03:35,919
How about that? He's got some skill.

35
00:03:35,944 --> 00:03:39,251
How did he retrieve that?!
It's like it was nothing to him!

36
00:03:39,276 --> 00:03:40,427
I know, right?

37
00:03:40,671 --> 00:03:41,748
Bring it!

38
00:03:41,773 --> 00:03:43,021
Number 10!

39
00:03:48,015 --> 00:03:49,037
Yeah!

40
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:51,507
Did you see that? Over on the right?

41
00:03:51,532 --> 00:03:56,564
Uh-huh. Reminds me of how Nekoma's
setter could throw people off with a look.

42
00:03:57,377 --> 00:04:00,567
Those magical sets of his should be illegal... Am I right?

43
00:04:00,687 --> 00:04:03,895
I'm kinda surprised Nishinoya
could save that one... Wait...

44
00:04:04,042 --> 00:04:08,771
Unless you think maybe Oikawa sent the ball
that way by accident; Could that be what happened?

45
00:04:08,796 --> 00:04:11,777
Nah... He meant it to be for Nishinoya.

46
00:04:12,997 --> 00:04:17,795
If he hadn't been able to save that one, it would
have done some serious damage to our team's morale.

47
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:18,323
You got it!

48
00:04:18,646 --> 00:04:20,915
I think that's probably what he was going for.

49
00:04:22,272 --> 00:04:26,129
That was close... You really saved our asses, Nishinoya.

50
00:04:26,995 --> 00:04:30,430
Hey uh I'm sorry... It's
just... they keep confusing me.

51
00:04:30,823 --> 00:04:34,079
Well, Karasuno did a number on Date Tech, after all...

52
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:36,439
Just give it a few minutes or so.

53
00:04:36,525 --> 00:04:38,678
It's not going to be much longer now.

54
00:04:39,052 --> 00:04:40,708
Anyway, I pity you.

55
00:04:41,722 --> 00:04:46,954
You were Kageyama's partner... Now he's gone
and replaced you. And with that little neophyte.

56
00:04:47,421 --> 00:04:48,522
No, it's okay...

57
00:04:48,547 --> 00:04:49,700
You bet it is...

58
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:55,366
So what if Kageyama saw you as... "just a
subpar servant"? That was back in middle school!

59
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:58,665
So what if we don't have a
legendary quick attack like theirs?

60
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:01,938
Let's show him he never should
have driven you away, Kindaichi.

61
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:05,223
You're clear to jump.

62
00:05:05,323 --> 00:05:06,614
Um... Yes sir!

63
00:05:08,005 --> 00:05:09,314
Alright, Tanaka!

64
00:05:09,467 --> 00:05:10,367
Do your best!

65
00:05:10,929 --> 00:05:11,711
Watari!

66
00:05:11,736 --> 00:05:12,008
Okay!

67
00:05:12,033 --> 00:05:12,982
Nice receive!

68
00:05:13,031 --> 00:05:14,066
Center Ball!

69
00:05:14,592 --> 00:05:15,605
An A-Quick!

70
00:05:22,258 --> 00:05:26,160
Kin-Dai-Chi! Kin-Dai-Chi! Geeeeet thaaaaat point!

71
00:05:26,191 --> 00:05:27,339
Am I crazy?

72
00:05:27,411 --> 00:05:33,129
Because I think their Number 12 is jumping higher
than he did in the practice game. I mean, right?

73
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:35,610
Your serve, Iwa!

74
00:05:38,594 --> 00:05:39,456
Sorry, cover!

75
00:05:39,729 --> 00:05:40,347
I got it!

76
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:41,993
Give it here!

77
00:05:52,557 --> 00:05:53,357
A-ha.

78
00:05:56,577 --> 00:05:58,017
I need a time-out, sir.

79
00:06:01,085 --> 00:06:04,660
Wait why is Seijoh calling a time out? This is weird.

80
00:06:04,745 --> 00:06:07,825
Yeah, didn't seem like Karasuno
was about to take the momentum.

81
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,333
Okay... pay attention to his choice of words.

82
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:13,595
"Bring it.. And "Give me."

83
00:06:14,407 --> 00:06:17,122
Are you serious? Did they already figure it out?

84
00:06:17,349 --> 00:06:19,172
How'd they crack it so fast?

85
00:06:19,705 --> 00:06:24,341
My first thought was, "Wow, that little guy
screams something every time he goes in to hit a set."

86
00:06:24,498 --> 00:06:26,188
I just assumed he was an idiot.

87
00:06:27,697 --> 00:06:30,632
But then I noticed, when they do that insane quick,

88
00:06:30,698 --> 00:06:34,091
he'll say "bring it here" or "bring
it" something with the word "bring".

89
00:06:34,613 --> 00:06:36,012
And for a normal quick...

90
00:06:36,037 --> 00:06:37,763
He says "give it here" instead.

91
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:38,803
Yes.

92
00:06:39,598 --> 00:06:42,562
However... he is their greatest decoy.

93
00:06:43,059 --> 00:06:44,659
And this is his strength...

94
00:06:44,765 --> 00:06:46,897
They want us to lock onto him...

95
00:06:47,093 --> 00:06:49,941
So we're going to employ a strategy to counter that.

96
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:53,894
Whenever the shorty says "bring
it", we'll put one mark on him...

97
00:06:54,271 --> 00:06:58,170
If he says "give me", we'll wait to
see where the ball goes before we jump.

98
00:06:58,490 --> 00:06:59,030
Okay?

99
00:06:59,055 --> 00:06:59,770
Sir!

100
00:07:01,085 --> 00:07:06,060
One thing though... We called a time-out pretty
early in the game for seemingly no reason at all...

101
00:07:06,102 --> 00:07:08,121
Won't they realize we're onto their game plan?

102
00:07:08,153 --> 00:07:11,477
So let them realize it! That
can only benefit us in the end...

103
00:07:11,621 --> 00:07:14,481
If those Karasuno clowns think we've got their number...

104
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:17,835
it's sure to make their poor setter lose his mind.

105
00:07:18,714 --> 00:07:21,912
Hey! That dumbfounded look doesn't suit you, dude.

106
00:07:22,232 --> 00:07:23,566
Nah, that's where you're wrong...

107
00:07:23,591 --> 00:07:26,160
I see this fool make this face at school all the time.

108
00:07:26,457 --> 00:07:29,837
Mostly when he can't make a decision
on what to get from the vending machine.

109
00:07:30,847 --> 00:07:32,498
I-I don't do that!

110
00:07:33,426 --> 00:07:36,539
Anyway, Noya... I can't believe you hit that serve!

111
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:40,147
Well, I had to deal with it back
in middle school. So I'm used to it.

112
00:07:40,719 --> 00:07:43,305
It was a killer serve whenever it actually went through...

113
00:07:43,712 --> 00:07:46,832
but the success rate was pretty
low, and it wasn't as controlled.

114
00:07:47,742 --> 00:07:49,544
He must have really been working on it.

115
00:07:50,818 --> 00:07:54,760
It takes quite a lot to stay in the
top 4... more than just great setters...

116
00:07:54,987 --> 00:07:58,029
or only one player with some
above-average serving technique.

117
00:07:59,005 --> 00:08:01,391
Don't let 'em off easy... Give 'em hell!

118
00:08:01,416 --> 00:08:02,322
Yeah!

119
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:04,844
D'oh!

120
00:08:05,077 --> 00:08:06,743
Did you just say "d'oh"?!

121
00:08:06,768 --> 00:08:08,722
It happens; Just keep your head up!

122
00:08:09,629 --> 00:08:11,711
Excellent, guys, let's set the trap...

123
00:08:11,857 --> 00:08:14,399
I assume you know where you should be aiming, Kindaichi.

124
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:15,230
Yeah!

125
00:08:15,523 --> 00:08:16,285
One point!

126
00:08:16,585 --> 00:08:18,162
Behind any strong setup...

127
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:21,217
is a solid initial receive.

128
00:08:22,605 --> 00:08:24,505
Kindaichi's serve!

129
00:08:27,357 --> 00:08:28,059
That's bizarre...

130
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:31,394
It didn't seem to be a particularly
powerful serve that time, did it?

131
00:08:38,502 --> 00:08:39,489
These are tricky.

132
00:08:40,351 --> 00:08:41,224
Wait a second...

133
00:08:41,757 --> 00:08:44,703
Are they shooting for when the
setter moves up from the back row?

134
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,488
That guy's not as good at serving as Oikawa,

135
00:08:47,513 --> 00:08:50,339
so why's the other team having
such a hard time hitting the ball?

136
00:08:50,364 --> 00:08:53,365
Ahem! Yeah, well, here's the thing, ladies.

137
00:08:54,822 --> 00:08:56,515
When the setter is in the back row,

138
00:08:56,721 --> 00:09:01,111
he can't get as close to the net as the
people in the front row until the serve goes up.

139
00:09:02,018 --> 00:09:06,110
That's why he has to move very
quickly to get to the net side position

140
00:09:06,135 --> 00:09:08,600
the second the other team puts the ball in the air.

141
00:09:09,434 --> 00:09:13,030
There's a tiny delay in the
receive as the players intersect,

142
00:09:13,063 --> 00:09:15,294
which makes it easy for mistakes to happen.

143
00:09:16,112 --> 00:09:21,075
But as long as everyone knows where the
serve is headed... they can still get it done.

144
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,690
Nice receive!

145
00:09:24,867 --> 00:09:25,998
Yeah!

146
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:28,344
Who knew this game could be so complicated?

147
00:09:29,478 --> 00:09:30,980
Thanks, random old guy!

148
00:09:31,012 --> 00:09:32,646
Wait what?! Aw man...

149
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,087
Heh.

150
00:09:35,266 --> 00:09:37,199
Oikawa's in the front row now.

151
00:09:37,652 --> 00:09:39,320
Watch number 3! We'll have to
look out for that setter dump.

152
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:40,205
Just serve!

153
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:43,477
Damn, this is a lot of pressure.

154
00:09:44,119 --> 00:09:45,978
There's already a 4-point gap.

155
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:51,857
Like the coach was saying, these guys know what's
in our bag of tricks. We need to switch things up!

156
00:09:55,227 --> 00:09:56,240
Nice receive!

157
00:09:57,489 --> 00:09:58,590
Setter dump!

158
00:10:02,282 --> 00:10:06,131
You shouldn't rush a setter dump,
you know... It's too easy to shut down.

159
00:10:08,697 --> 00:10:11,582
Haaaaaaa... bam!

160
00:10:11,608 --> 00:10:13,877
Yeah!

161
00:10:13,983 --> 00:10:15,274
Woooo!

162
00:10:15,684 --> 00:10:18,035
Just 4 more points to turn this around!

163
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:18,995
Yeah, yeah!

164
00:10:19,128 --> 00:10:20,806
You are so positive!

165
00:10:21,816 --> 00:10:24,260
And it's really kinda getting on my nerves.

166
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:28,692
Give it here!

167
00:10:29,572 --> 00:10:32,104
We'll wait to see where the ball goes before we jump.

168
00:10:33,582 --> 00:10:34,288
That's it!

169
00:10:38,223 --> 00:10:38,969
Yes!

170
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,462
They figured it out...

171
00:10:41,895 --> 00:10:43,161
Kageyama's serve!

172
00:10:43,408 --> 00:10:44,496
You got this!

173
00:10:44,603 --> 00:10:46,327
This time, I won't miss!

174
00:10:50,106 --> 00:10:51,415
It's too far forward!

175
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,426
Good.. He adjusted for a softer serve!

176
00:10:58,637 --> 00:10:59,110
Damn!

177
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:01,723
You don't honestly think I'll let you get away with that?

178
00:11:03,193 --> 00:11:06,878
Kageyama made the first touch! Now he can't make the set!

179
00:11:07,621 --> 00:11:08,208
Here!

180
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,053
No way!

181
00:11:11,016 --> 00:11:13,565
He turned a tight spot into an opportunity...

182
00:11:13,872 --> 00:11:15,730
The kid sure is cool under pressure.

183
00:11:16,256 --> 00:11:18,240
He's not thinking like the other guys.

184
00:11:19,013 --> 00:11:20,408
It's okay, guys!

185
00:11:20,433 --> 00:11:21,970
Yeah, keep it up... uh-oh.

186
00:11:22,512 --> 00:11:25,316
The next serve... is Oikawa.

187
00:11:25,744 --> 00:11:30,337
Nothing shakes a team's confidence more
than when their big talker suddenly goes quiet.

188
00:11:33,876 --> 00:11:38,562
Oooooooolé.

189
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:01,792
Shake it off! Get the next one!

190
00:12:02,293 --> 00:12:06,026
The best way to build pressure is
ruining several serve-receives in a row.

191
00:12:06,937 --> 00:12:09,827
First step is silencing that loud skinhead.

192
00:12:10,567 --> 00:12:11,767
Then the ace.

193
00:12:12,061 --> 00:12:15,030
Breaking the two left players
who are crucial to the attack...

194
00:12:15,387 --> 00:12:17,650
will nullify the decoy's efforts.

195
00:12:19,946 --> 00:12:23,356
That was quick! Why is Karasuno
already calling a time out?

196
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:26,042
They probably did it because
Seijoh has all the momentum...

197
00:12:26,244 --> 00:12:29,281
And if they can't fix that soon,
they'll never be able to catch up.

198
00:12:29,359 --> 00:12:32,411
They keep going after that same guy. Sucks to be him.

199
00:12:32,712 --> 00:12:38,519
Look... Send the ball to the setter... And if
you can't do that... then at least keep it up high.

200
00:12:38,567 --> 00:12:39,250
Yes, sir!

201
00:12:39,929 --> 00:12:42,018
And you, Mr. Serious Pants.

202
00:12:42,802 --> 00:12:44,075
Yeah that setter dump...

203
00:12:44,248 --> 00:12:45,488
What the hell were you thinkin'?

204
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:48,320
I'm sorry... I snapped.

205
00:12:49,302 --> 00:12:50,968
Okay, as long as you know...

206
00:12:51,348 --> 00:12:52,799
But it's more than that, though.

207
00:12:53,985 --> 00:12:58,225
It's good to show our opponents that we
have a variety of offensive techniques.

208
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:02,576
But once they're onto you,
it's easy for them to stop a dump.

209
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,084
You have to be extremely careful about how you time those.

210
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:06,935
Sir!

211
00:13:07,459 --> 00:13:13,020
Listen, do not forget who the opponent is
here... It's Aoba-Johsai, not just Oikawa.

212
00:13:13,523 --> 00:13:17,035
And you're not the only one fighting them. It's all of us.

213
00:13:17,632 --> 00:13:18,307
Yes, sir.

214
00:13:20,306 --> 00:13:21,274
Oikawa!

215
00:13:21,299 --> 00:13:22,426
Let's go!

216
00:13:25,198 --> 00:13:29,543
Oooooooolé.

217
00:13:30,088 --> 00:13:30,824
There it goes!

218
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:41,647
You're doing fine! Just keep the ball in the air, Tanaka!

219
00:13:41,694 --> 00:13:42,233
Uh-huh.

220
00:13:45,819 --> 00:13:46,640
Tanaka!

221
00:13:47,756 --> 00:13:48,683
Hey, cover!

222
00:13:49,866 --> 00:13:50,852
Number 5!

223
00:13:50,892 --> 00:13:51,613
Tanaka!

224
00:13:55,104 --> 00:13:55,776
Time!

225
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:56,296
Right!

226
00:13:56,732 --> 00:13:59,903
It's kinda early to use up both
of our time outs, don't you think?

227
00:13:59,928 --> 00:14:03,316
Then again, we've gotta do something
to get the momentum on our side.

228
00:14:03,821 --> 00:14:05,997
Yeah, that's the thing about volleyball...

229
00:14:06,629 --> 00:14:08,975
Everything hinges on keeping the ball in play.

230
00:14:09,414 --> 00:14:12,307
Nothing's worse than the guilt
from repeatedly screwing up.

231
00:14:13,289 --> 00:14:13,930
Yeah...

232
00:14:14,046 --> 00:14:17,023
And then they add insult to
injury by going after him like that.

233
00:14:17,507 --> 00:14:19,580
Number 5 is having a rough day.

234
00:14:20,733 --> 00:14:22,326
Maybe I should say something to him?

235
00:14:23,577 --> 00:14:28,593
After all, Tanaka's always got an encouraging
word for me whenever I start to doubt myself...

236
00:14:30,105 --> 00:14:31,522
Yeah, I will.

237
00:14:31,553 --> 00:14:32,074
Hey...

238
00:14:34,428 --> 00:14:35,829
I'm so stupid!

239
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:43,217
I'm sorry!

240
00:14:43,882 --> 00:14:46,401
Tanaka! Some things you just can't help, okay?

241
00:14:46,426 --> 00:14:49,033
That last set was ridiculous, AND they triple-blocked you!

242
00:14:49,058 --> 00:14:49,962
I should've followed through...

243
00:14:49,987 --> 00:14:52,504
Shut it! I didn't call for the ball!

244
00:14:53,217 --> 00:14:55,050
I just... I lost my focus!

245
00:14:56,164 --> 00:14:58,878
And I'll be kicking myself
like hell when the game is over!

246
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,148
I'm not gonna drag you guys down!

247
00:15:01,394 --> 00:15:05,476
And I won't have you wasting your
time... crying over MY stupid mistakes!

248
00:15:05,762 --> 00:15:07,444
I'll... do better.

249
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:10,783
Ha! The fact that you can say
that is good enough for me, buddy!

250
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:12,407
Uh.. Thanks.

251
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:16,336
Make sure to use both your arms and
your feet, or it'll bounce right off you.

252
00:15:17,385 --> 00:15:20,271
You could stand to be more
like Tanaka; You know that, Asahi?

253
00:15:20,296 --> 00:15:21,940
I'm doing my best here, okay?!

254
00:15:22,246 --> 00:15:24,985
Huh... this is the second time I've noticed it.

255
00:15:25,358 --> 00:15:27,514
Oikawa is looking really off.

256
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:31,919
Yeah, well I heard it's his little ritual
to keep himself from breaking concentration.

257
00:15:32,046 --> 00:15:35,249
A lot of teams call time-outs just
to throw off their opponent's groove.

258
00:15:35,362 --> 00:15:36,486
We'll see if it works.

259
00:15:39,907 --> 00:15:40,934
Bring it on!

260
00:15:42,311 --> 00:15:43,864
It's all you, Oikawa!

261
00:15:44,301 --> 00:15:46,821
Man, he's really got his head in the game...

262
00:15:47,701 --> 00:15:49,905
It's up to you guys to take control now.

263
00:15:51,293 --> 00:15:55,929
Ooooooooolé!

264
00:15:57,515 --> 00:15:59,244
If it hits the ground, we're dead!

265
00:15:59,269 --> 00:15:59,833
Tanaka!

266
00:16:01,945 --> 00:16:02,461
Crap!

267
00:16:03,405 --> 00:16:04,645
Don't let it fall!

268
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,796
That's what I'm talking about!

269
00:16:10,821 --> 00:16:12,553
And in the best possible spot.

270
00:16:12,578 --> 00:16:13,145
Here!

271
00:16:13,816 --> 00:16:14,848
Get it, Hanamaki!

272
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:19,149
Nice receive!

273
00:16:19,216 --> 00:16:20,311
Someone cover!

274
00:16:20,678 --> 00:16:22,726
Left, now!

275
00:16:22,977 --> 00:16:23,639
Tanaka!

276
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:27,604
Tanaka makes his share of mistakes.

277
00:16:27,751 --> 00:16:30,801
And he takes the bait every
time someone pushes his buttons...

278
00:16:31,015 --> 00:16:31,437
But...

279
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:35,489
His power's second only to Asahi's...

280
00:16:36,231 --> 00:16:41,804
and he's got the mental fortitude to keep trucking and
play his best, even when he's near his breaking point.

281
00:16:43,884 --> 00:16:45,044
No doubt about it...

282
00:16:48,476 --> 00:16:49,789
He could be an ace.

283
00:16:52,204 --> 00:16:53,051
Whoa!

284
00:16:53,076 --> 00:16:55,288
Looks like the bald kid's got it goin' on, now!

285
00:16:55,413 --> 00:16:57,419
He pulled the rug right out from under 'em.

286
00:16:57,655 --> 00:16:59,792
Yeaaaaaaah!

287
00:16:59,817 --> 00:17:00,639
Not bad!

288
00:17:01,297 --> 00:17:04,799
Well, that's alright; I suppose
I can let go of a point or two.

289
00:17:05,301 --> 00:17:08,359
Whoo, that was the best look at a block I ever had!

290
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:14,813
I just mean... sometimes I can see the other team's block
in midair, clear as day, like it's in slo-mo.

291
00:17:14,986 --> 00:17:18,130
With a bright ray of light shining through it.

292
00:17:19,003 --> 00:17:20,831
That sounds so cool!

293
00:17:21,724 --> 00:17:22,703
You'll see one day!

294
00:17:22,728 --> 00:17:24,069
It's your serve, jackass!

295
00:17:24,094 --> 00:17:24,529
Right!

296
00:17:25,487 --> 00:17:27,153
Their flow's been broken.

297
00:17:28,574 --> 00:17:29,707
And there's still time...

298
00:17:31,267 --> 00:17:32,577
We can come back!

299
00:17:36,162 --> 00:17:36,792
Nice one-touch!

300
00:17:36,817 --> 00:17:38,609
Chance ball, baby! Woo!

301
00:17:38,854 --> 00:17:40,409
Bring it here!

302
00:17:43,818 --> 00:17:44,599
Gotcha!

303
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:47,231
He's too fast even when we expect him!

304
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:52,213
Look, you... Please don't tell me
you still can't beat that kid's sets.

305
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,483
Kageyama's? Of course I can't...

306
00:17:54,643 --> 00:17:57,260
You really think I can do a pinpoint set like that?

307
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,140
Please don't be mad!

308
00:17:59,826 --> 00:18:04,775
I may not have as much talent, but I'm more in tune
with my teammates' capabilities than he'll ever be.

309
00:18:06,404 --> 00:18:08,868
So, I'm just as good a setter as he is.

310
00:18:14,076 --> 00:18:15,622
It got past the block again.

311
00:18:16,116 --> 00:18:18,217
Aw, don't look so shocked, little guy.

312
00:18:18,336 --> 00:18:22,090
Striking right above the blockers is
what Kindaichi does best, after all.

313
00:18:23,601 --> 00:18:24,367
Forward!

314
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:28,192
7 points. That's way too big a gap!

315
00:18:28,217 --> 00:18:28,966
Bring it!

316
00:18:31,204 --> 00:18:35,028
Wow, they're really bringing their
A-game today, aren't they? I'm impressed!

317
00:18:37,356 --> 00:18:40,198
We do not need to deal with a double-block right now.

318
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:43,516
If we're not careful, they'll take back the momentum...

319
00:18:43,704 --> 00:18:45,900
I have to shake one of those blockers.

320
00:18:46,676 --> 00:18:51,586
During my second year of high school, I heard about
a middle schooler who was a legend in his own time.

321
00:18:52,516 --> 00:18:53,730
"The King of the Court?"

322
00:18:54,045 --> 00:18:57,125
I thought. "He must be wonderful at what he does."

323
00:18:57,861 --> 00:19:01,371
But when I saw him play, I knew
the name meant something else.

324
00:19:02,133 --> 00:19:06,940
He's got power, and talent, and he craves
victory more intensely than anyone I know.

325
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:10,837
All those qualities make up Tobio Kageyama's strengths.

326
00:19:11,709 --> 00:19:12,339
But...

327
00:19:13,484 --> 00:19:15,264
they're also his weaknesses.

328
00:19:16,566 --> 00:19:18,814
No man is an island, little Tobio...

329
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:22,113
You may have been at this for two months now, but...

330
00:19:23,175 --> 00:19:26,266
It takes longer than that to break a bad habit.

331
00:19:27,411 --> 00:19:28,774
Nice kill, Hanamaki!

332
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:29,849
Yeah! Way to go!

333
00:19:29,954 --> 00:19:30,929
Woo!

334
00:19:31,061 --> 00:19:31,928
Hey, Hinata!

335
00:19:32,782 --> 00:19:35,646
It's time to change it up... Do you remember the signals?

336
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:38,813
Remember? You mean we're gonna use
the signals that we talked about?!

337
00:19:39,995 --> 00:19:41,495
Now that's a block!

338
00:19:42,926 --> 00:19:44,016
Ah! It's mine!

339
00:19:44,794 --> 00:19:45,655
One more time!

340
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:50,474
Y'know... I've been watching Karasuno's
attacks... I think they're gradually speeding up.

341
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:54,379
I don't like how fast this is going.

342
00:19:54,858 --> 00:19:56,588
We don't have any time-outs left.

343
00:19:56,974 --> 00:19:59,866
Slow it down, fellas! Stay cool out there!

344
00:20:00,336 --> 00:20:02,011
That's not very wise of them...

345
00:20:02,386 --> 00:20:06,947
They're so desperate to outrun our
blockers... they're valuing speed above all else.

346
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:08,813
But they're losing their accuracy.

347
00:20:10,815 --> 00:20:17,124
Whether they realize it or not, as their speed
increases... the number of mistakes will increase as well.

348
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:20,296
You really are something, Tobio Kageyama.

349
00:20:21,216 --> 00:20:24,516
No one but you could pull off
that combo move with the short kid...

350
00:20:25,548 --> 00:20:27,156
But it's not all about him.

351
00:20:28,326 --> 00:20:30,958
Don't you think your Number 3
would have what he needs to overcome

352
00:20:30,989 --> 00:20:34,438
our blockers if you would only set
to him a little slower from now on?

353
00:20:35,705 --> 00:20:39,704
Wouldn't it help if Four-Eyes actually
trusted your sets when he hit them?

354
00:20:41,151 --> 00:20:43,711
Every spiker has his own unique quirks.

355
00:20:44,022 --> 00:20:47,439
The player who can take those quirks
and use them to their potential is...

356
00:20:49,009 --> 00:20:50,617
a true setter.

357
00:20:54,943 --> 00:20:57,918
This is bad! The gap isn't shrinking!

358
00:20:59,059 --> 00:21:01,124
I'll do whatever it takes to fix this!

359
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:03,196
Over the net! Push it back!

360
00:21:23,635 --> 00:21:27,002
You know, Kageyama just doesn't
seem like himself anymore, does he?

361
00:21:32,469 --> 00:21:33,534
Nice receive!

362
00:21:35,467 --> 00:21:38,203
I won't lose this game! I refuse to!

363
00:21:38,396 --> 00:21:40,685
I have to win and stay on the court!

364
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:46,856
Get ready!

365
00:21:46,881 --> 00:21:47,563
Nice follow thru!

366
00:21:47,588 --> 00:21:48,408
Chance ball!

367
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,296
Oikawa's got horse sense, and
he puts in a decent effort...

368
00:21:52,836 --> 00:21:57,377
But compared to a wiz-kid like Kageyama
who's two years younger than he is...

369
00:21:58,636 --> 00:22:01,775
He's got skill, but he's far from a genius.

370
00:22:02,706 --> 00:22:08,133
Still, with the way things are currently, I can
confidently say that the more proficient setter...

371
00:22:08,803 --> 00:22:09,822
is Oikawa.

372
00:23:59,089 --> 00:24:00,589
A swap? Right now?

373
00:24:00,842 --> 00:24:02,360
Man, that's brutal...

374
00:24:02,491 --> 00:24:05,316
It's hard to keep your head up when
you have to leave the court like that.

375
00:24:05,616 --> 00:24:08,589
How would you know, Shimada? You're a a benchwarmer.

376
00:24:09,684 --> 00:24:12,606
Next Haikyu!! "The Talented Upperclassman."
