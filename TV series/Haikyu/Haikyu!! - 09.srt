1
00:00:01,969 --> 00:00:04,040
Come on! Gimme another one!

2
00:00:04,405 --> 00:00:06,752
Alright, shut up, I get it! Ready?

3
00:00:06,856 --> 00:00:07,476
Yeah!

4
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:12,277
Ah!

5
00:00:13,405 --> 00:00:15,867
Gah! That felt so good!

6
00:00:15,986 --> 00:00:19,060
And once I reach the top of my
jump, the ball hits my hand...

7
00:00:19,243 --> 00:00:24,112
And when the weight of it... Sorta
leaves a sting in my palm... I love that!

8
00:00:27,308 --> 00:00:31,255
Sweet! Those cats won't stand a
chance against our quick-attacks!

9
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:35,784
Huh? Cats? Are they playing against Nekoma?

10
00:00:36,811 --> 00:00:39,906
We've got ourselves a practice
game... It's the last day of camp.

11
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:40,473
Aahh!

12
00:00:40,498 --> 00:00:42,952
Hey what's your problem?! Don't run away from me!

13
00:00:42,977 --> 00:00:45,618
I'm getting out of here. You scare me when you get mad!

14
00:00:45,643 --> 00:00:47,716
Well it's not like I'm mad all the time!

15
00:00:49,563 --> 00:00:52,279
We weren't expecting this... We know nothing about them...

16
00:00:52,304 --> 00:00:54,686
And the rivalry feels like an old folktale...

17
00:00:54,711 --> 00:00:59,014
I mean it was the generation before
us... so it was never really relevant to us.

18
00:00:59,666 --> 00:01:04,074
But now... it's time to face off, crows versus cats!

19
00:01:04,451 --> 00:01:09,254
It's so strange to think that we're about to
have our first rematch with Nekoma in years...

20
00:01:09,279 --> 00:01:11,275
I gotta say I'm pretty psyched about it.

21
00:01:12,898 --> 00:01:14,223
It's just Suga...

22
00:01:14,341 --> 00:01:16,326
And well of course Nishinoya, too...

23
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:17,511
I can't face them.

24
00:01:19,666 --> 00:01:21,350
You know what, Asahi...

25
00:01:21,891 --> 00:01:24,995
You really are pretty timid,
especially for such a big guy!

26
00:01:25,227 --> 00:01:27,196
And Nishinoya's the opposite of that.

27
00:01:27,563 --> 00:01:30,152
And you could stand to be a lot less blunt...

28
00:01:30,791 --> 00:01:34,746
Anyway, it'll be fine... Nobody else
on the team has a problem with it...

29
00:01:34,975 --> 00:01:37,200
Unlike you, they're pretty open-minded.

30
00:01:37,377 --> 00:01:41,131
Uh, Daichi? I thought I remembered you being nicer.

31
00:01:41,203 --> 00:01:44,223
I'll be nicer when you stop being such a wuss.

32
00:01:46,217 --> 00:01:49,506
I don't care so much about you skipping
out of club activities for a month,

33
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:52,165
and then feeling awkward about finally coming back.

34
00:01:54,297 --> 00:01:56,345
Because if you still love volleyball...

35
00:01:57,410 --> 00:01:59,267
That's reason enough to play.

36
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:02,129
Not just that...

37
00:02:03,021 --> 00:02:06,578
But we've got this new kid whose dream is to be the ace.

38
00:02:12,713 --> 00:02:13,892
Ah... hey!

39
00:03:45,695 --> 00:03:50,632
On the banks of the Hirose ri-i-ver...

40
00:03:51,046 --> 00:03:55,317
Memories afloat... On the stream...

41
00:03:56,326 --> 00:04:00,896
Dancing lights... over the rapids-

42
00:04:02,651 --> 00:04:03,672
Hey! What're you doing here?!

43
00:04:03,697 --> 00:04:07,254
Uh I'm sorry! I was just seeing
if you had any customers...

44
00:04:07,901 --> 00:04:09,978
Are you here to ask me to coach again?

45
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:10,576
Yes.

46
00:04:12,801 --> 00:04:15,017
It's not that I don't still love to play.

47
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:17,718
I even put together a neighborhood team.

48
00:04:18,618 --> 00:04:21,452
I can't be a coach 'cause I'd
drive myself crazy wanting to play.

49
00:04:21,477 --> 00:04:22,223
Oh...

50
00:04:22,298 --> 00:04:24,866
And besides... I can't go anywhere near that gym.

51
00:04:24,891 --> 00:04:28,171
Ah! Uh... Did something tragic happen there?

52
00:04:28,196 --> 00:04:31,230
Not in the least! All my best memories are there.

53
00:04:31,549 --> 00:04:32,804
Then why can't you?

54
00:04:34,953 --> 00:04:38,294
I don't care if it's totally
different or exactly the way I left it.

55
00:04:39,505 --> 00:04:42,489
I can't go into that gym or the club room ever again.

56
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:45,507
The short time I spent there was so unique...

57
00:04:46,382 --> 00:04:49,370
If I went back, it'd feel like opening a time capsule.

58
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:53,372
Oh, so it's a nostalgia thing... 'Kay I get it-

59
00:04:53,397 --> 00:04:54,532
Shut up!

60
00:04:55,396 --> 00:04:57,685
And anyway... it's still a 'no.'

61
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:01,636
Even if Nekoma High's on the schedule?

62
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:06,337
The last day of golden week. It's our
first time facing them in five years.

63
00:05:06,883 --> 00:05:08,363
You have got to be kidding me.

64
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:13,494
Coach Nekomata... the man that your
grandfather used to be such good friends with...

65
00:05:13,746 --> 00:05:18,842
He just came out of retirement. Once I
heard that... I asked them for a practice game.

66
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:21,663
Back when you were still in high school...

67
00:05:21,798 --> 00:05:25,141
That was when Karasuno had the
strongest ties with them, right?

68
00:05:25,257 --> 00:05:25,851
Yeah.

69
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:29,433
And by the way... Their current coach...

70
00:05:29,634 --> 00:05:33,398
He is the same guy who played the
setter position about 7 or 8 years ago.

71
00:05:35,675 --> 00:05:37,627
This is our last shot, Ukai.

72
00:05:38,589 --> 00:05:41,279
I want to see you at nationals this year, alright?

73
00:05:41,484 --> 00:05:42,098
Sure!

74
00:05:43,485 --> 00:05:44,415
I'll be there!

75
00:05:45,764 --> 00:05:47,625
That was back when you were active in the club...

76
00:05:48,391 --> 00:05:51,282
So I was thinking... that maybe
you two might know each other.

77
00:05:52,263 --> 00:05:52,778
Hey...

78
00:05:52,867 --> 00:05:53,317
Hm?

79
00:05:54,001 --> 00:05:55,882
Are you trying to mess with me?!

80
00:05:55,907 --> 00:05:57,806
I'm sorry! I'm really sorry!

81
00:05:57,831 --> 00:06:01,944
This is bullshit! You just came here to push my
buttons! Did you really think that would work?!

82
00:06:01,969 --> 00:06:03,025
What time is practice today?

83
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:05,026
I said I... Huh?

84
00:06:06,402 --> 00:06:07,116
You mean that...?

85
00:06:07,203 --> 00:06:11,272
I'm not letting those pathetic underclassmen
embarrass our school in front of Nekoma.

86
00:06:11,584 --> 00:06:13,309
Stay right here, I'll go get changed.

87
00:06:13,334 --> 00:06:14,449
Okay! Great!

88
00:06:15,068 --> 00:06:16,960
Hey ma, can you watch the store?

89
00:06:18,772 --> 00:06:19,557
Yes!

90
00:06:20,568 --> 00:06:22,791
Hey, uh, Tatsu? It's me.

91
00:06:23,288 --> 00:06:23,888
Huh?

92
00:06:31,967 --> 00:06:33,343
Hey... Noya?

93
00:06:33,647 --> 00:06:34,184
Yeah?

94
00:06:34,846 --> 00:06:37,592
What kinda training did you do while you were suspended?

95
00:06:38,207 --> 00:06:40,587
Hm... I focused on blocked ball retrieval.

96
00:06:41,574 --> 00:06:43,788
So the ball doesn't hit the floor after they block!

97
00:06:44,483 --> 00:06:46,283
I haven't gotten it down perfect yet...

98
00:06:46,308 --> 00:06:48,309
But if I manage to get really good at it...

99
00:06:48,755 --> 00:06:51,790
Then you spikers won't have to
worry... and you can just spike.

100
00:06:53,694 --> 00:06:57,306
Man... every time I see this guy, he's got more bruises.

101
00:06:58,581 --> 00:07:01,460
Noya! How are you such a badass all the time?!

102
00:07:01,485 --> 00:07:02,927
It's nothing to cry about!

103
00:07:04,015 --> 00:07:05,141
Um excuse me!

104
00:07:05,487 --> 00:07:06,779
Alright come over here, guys!

105
00:07:08,137 --> 00:07:09,487
This is Ukai...

106
00:07:09,577 --> 00:07:12,703
As of today, he'll be your coach! Say hello everyone!

107
00:07:12,806 --> 00:07:13,687
Huh?

108
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:21,348
Whoa, are you serious?! We have a new coach?!

109
00:07:21,613 --> 00:07:23,375
Just until after the Nekoma game.

110
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:24,306
Huh?

111
00:07:24,452 --> 00:07:28,007
Hey wait... Isn't that the grumpy
guy who runs the Sakanoshita store?

112
00:07:28,032 --> 00:07:29,294
He's coaching us?

113
00:07:29,505 --> 00:07:33,528
He's actually used to go to this
school. He's the old coach Ukai's grandson.

114
00:07:33,584 --> 00:07:34,388
Huh?!

115
00:07:34,413 --> 00:07:36,689
But your store's called Sakanoshita, right?

116
00:07:36,714 --> 00:07:39,123
You shoulda called it Ukai, dude! I mean, sir!

117
00:07:39,148 --> 00:07:41,226
It's named for my mom's side of the family.

118
00:07:41,885 --> 00:07:43,888
Anyway, let's not waste any more time!

119
00:07:44,221 --> 00:07:47,861
I set you up a game for 6:30...
So c'mon let's see what you got.

120
00:07:47,886 --> 00:07:48,432
Huh?!

121
00:07:48,456 --> 00:07:49,642
They're gonna be here soon.

122
00:07:50,158 --> 00:07:50,785
Who will?

123
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:53,851
Our friendly neighborhood association team.

124
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:05,747
Because if you still love volleyball,
that's reason enough to play.

125
00:08:11,997 --> 00:08:12,650
Going in!

126
00:08:13,153 --> 00:08:13,853
Okay!

127
00:08:14,305 --> 00:08:14,686
Hup!

128
00:08:15,751 --> 00:08:16,672
Coming your way!

129
00:08:17,352 --> 00:08:19,332
Damn... He won't pick up.

130
00:08:19,632 --> 00:08:22,757
I guess it was too short notice to
get 'em all together on a weekday.

131
00:08:22,782 --> 00:08:23,408
Heads up!

132
00:08:30,249 --> 00:08:30,750
Here.

133
00:08:31,581 --> 00:08:33,820
Um... thanks I appreciate it.

134
00:08:34,275 --> 00:08:35,037
What's up!

135
00:08:35,463 --> 00:08:35,994
Hey.

136
00:08:36,156 --> 00:08:37,121
Oh, man!

137
00:08:37,146 --> 00:08:38,212
Takes me back!

138
00:08:39,135 --> 00:08:39,944
Uh, hi?

139
00:08:42,064 --> 00:08:43,486
We're the Neighborhood Club Team.

140
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:46,689
Let's do this!

141
00:08:47,975 --> 00:08:50,350
Hey! Thanks for comin' out at the last minute!

142
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:52,336
The neighborhood association huh...

143
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:54,625
I was picturing a bunch of old guys.

144
00:08:54,888 --> 00:08:55,578
Me too.

145
00:08:57,079 --> 00:08:59,685
Alright! You boys ready to play or what?

146
00:08:59,899 --> 00:09:01,775
Yeah! Here we go!

147
00:09:02,692 --> 00:09:05,118
Hm? What's with you? You sick?

148
00:09:06,203 --> 00:09:08,814
Oh... sorry... he's not ready to play yet.

149
00:09:09,044 --> 00:09:11,326
Why not? Is he injured or something? What's wrong?

150
00:09:11,351 --> 00:09:13,834
No, it's not really as straightforward as all that.

151
00:09:14,272 --> 00:09:17,760
So he's not gonna participate then? Well whatever it is..

152
00:09:17,785 --> 00:09:22,437
You can play with us if you want to... our libero's
been pretty tied up with a buncha work stuff.

153
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,078
Do... you want to?

154
00:09:28,389 --> 00:09:31,799
Hm, we're still short a couple
guys. You have more members, don't you?

155
00:09:31,824 --> 00:09:33,315
There's Asahi! Look!

156
00:09:34,826 --> 00:09:36,282
Asahi! Hey!

157
00:09:36,307 --> 00:09:38,117
Agh! It's that short guy again!

158
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:40,163
Hey, listen, I was just here to uhhh...

159
00:09:40,188 --> 00:09:43,957
You gotta be kidding! Late on the coach's
first day?! What position do you play?!

160
00:09:44,294 --> 00:09:45,475
Uh-wing spiker?

161
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:49,094
Whatever, I don't care, we need some more
players! Get your ass in here and warm up!

162
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:50,826
Chop chop, man-bun!

163
00:10:15,787 --> 00:10:20,559
So we just need a setter... I would do it
myself, but I really should watch the game.

164
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:23,964
Hey, do me a favor and let me
borrow one of your setters, would ya?

165
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:29,526
Sugawara!

166
00:10:30,822 --> 00:10:33,004
Listen you're not doing this for me, are you?

167
00:10:33,594 --> 00:10:38,722
Because if the only way I can rise up the
ranks is at your expense... I'm not doing it.

168
00:10:40,285 --> 00:10:40,954
You know what...

169
00:10:41,977 --> 00:10:45,876
Whenever you joined the club... I knew
that I had to fight you for the setter spot...

170
00:10:46,453 --> 00:10:48,644
But it was kinda... it was a relief.

171
00:10:49,957 --> 00:10:52,210
The setter is the attack axis for the whole team.

172
00:10:52,544 --> 00:10:56,032
A setter has to be composed and steadfast... but I...

173
00:10:56,876 --> 00:10:59,321
I was too nervous to put the ball in the right spot.

174
00:11:00,717 --> 00:11:05,986
After what happened to Asahi, I was so afraid that
my tosses would cause another spiker to get blocked...

175
00:11:06,635 --> 00:11:09,401
So I was content to just hide in Kageyama's shadow.

176
00:11:10,654 --> 00:11:12,480
It was... easier.

177
00:11:14,995 --> 00:11:18,342
Just the thought of a spike getting
shut down like that terrifies me.

178
00:11:20,637 --> 00:11:25,751
But... please let me... set for you one more time... okay?

179
00:11:28,277 --> 00:11:31,080
I'm playing on their side... oh and...

180
00:11:31,262 --> 00:11:31,675
Hm?

181
00:11:33,251 --> 00:11:34,576
I am not losing.

182
00:11:35,498 --> 00:11:36,617
And me neither.

183
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,342
Now give me some of your famous receives, okay?

184
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:41,495
Oh you know it.

185
00:11:44,899 --> 00:11:47,125
Asahi decided to come... see?

186
00:11:47,693 --> 00:11:49,789
Yeah well... is he gonna stay?

187
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:51,974
Thank you!

188
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:56,232
Looks pretty threatening standing over here.

189
00:11:56,689 --> 00:11:58,988
Alright, kids... Don't poop your pants.

190
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:04,208
Let's see the ace in action!

191
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:22,334
Nice receive!

192
00:12:25,999 --> 00:12:27,867
Hey, that was a great set there, buddy!

193
00:12:28,007 --> 00:12:29,035
Really nice job!

194
00:12:29,194 --> 00:12:31,029
Wow! Thank you so much!

195
00:12:31,217 --> 00:12:33,014
Sugawara's killing it!

196
00:12:33,306 --> 00:12:36,841
Well of course he is! Suga's
our official setter, after all!

197
00:12:37,467 --> 00:12:39,074
He's so happy...

198
00:12:39,787 --> 00:12:41,409
Hey, nice going, Suga!

199
00:12:41,687 --> 00:12:43,911
Thanks... but I didn't do anything special.

200
00:12:43,936 --> 00:12:47,149
It's only because they're adjusting
their whole dynamic to suit my play style...

201
00:12:47,354 --> 00:12:49,155
These people are real vets of the game.

202
00:12:49,596 --> 00:12:50,186
Yeah!

203
00:12:50,211 --> 00:12:52,116
My setting still needs quite a bit of work.

204
00:12:53,715 --> 00:12:56,690
Still... we have to start playing hardball...

205
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:59,108
And get a good handle on those fast attacks too...

206
00:12:59,327 --> 00:13:02,442
If we don't, the game'll ride
on just one player like last time.

207
00:13:05,087 --> 00:13:07,362
You know... you're actually kinda cool.

208
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:11,405
What? Really? Wow, coming from
you, that's kind of a huge compliment.

209
00:13:12,142 --> 00:13:13,330
Huh? Why's that?

210
00:13:13,441 --> 00:13:14,189
Well uh...

211
00:13:16,428 --> 00:13:20,113
Suga, you've become much more of a leader than I remember.

212
00:13:20,869 --> 00:13:23,839
And Nishinoya is as constant as ever.

213
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:29,305
And here I am, coming out of nowhere
and just drifting back onto the team...

214
00:13:30,599 --> 00:13:31,857
I'm so pathetic...

215
00:13:33,241 --> 00:13:34,167
But even so...

216
00:13:36,474 --> 00:13:37,689
You can do it!

217
00:13:37,756 --> 00:13:38,524
One more!

218
00:13:40,095 --> 00:13:40,931
I really...

219
00:13:42,576 --> 00:13:44,654
I really do love being here.

220
00:13:48,595 --> 00:13:50,271
Whoa! That was nuts!

221
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:52,292
Haha! We did it! Hahaha!

222
00:13:52,317 --> 00:13:54,030
He really got some air!

223
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,763
And that set was scary accurate.

224
00:14:00,135 --> 00:14:01,810
That was excellent, you two!

225
00:14:02,695 --> 00:14:06,528
Thanks to Kageyama's amazing
sets I can get past anybody now!

226
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:12,103
The wall just fades away, and then the
view of the other side is totally clear!

227
00:14:14,768 --> 00:14:16,887
The view of the other side...

228
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:25,395
We're good!

229
00:14:25,722 --> 00:14:26,798
One more try!

230
00:14:30,929 --> 00:14:31,792
That's a bluff!

231
00:14:32,957 --> 00:14:34,020
Good job, Noya!

232
00:14:34,162 --> 00:14:34,844
Asahi!

233
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:45,093
Well they did flub that one...
But their libero's a superstar.

234
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:47,268
My bad! I'll get it next time!

235
00:14:48,463 --> 00:14:50,067
Too bad their attacker's no good.

236
00:14:51,485 --> 00:14:55,689
Blocked again... how many times
has that happened to me now?

237
00:14:56,703 --> 00:15:01,027
I've asked for so many chances. I
promised I would make them count.

238
00:15:01,936 --> 00:15:04,087
But then I was paralyzed by my fear...

239
00:15:04,301 --> 00:15:06,386
And I didn't want to call for them anymore.

240
00:15:07,929 --> 00:15:08,912
What's going on?

241
00:15:08,937 --> 00:15:09,588
Asahi?

242
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:10,970
Suga, aim right!

243
00:15:11,472 --> 00:15:12,195
D-Daichi!

244
00:15:12,597 --> 00:15:13,466
Uwwwaaah!

245
00:15:21,384 --> 00:15:22,126
Dammit!

246
00:15:25,177 --> 00:15:28,757
I was worthless out there... I
couldn't save a single blocked ball!

247
00:15:30,891 --> 00:15:33,691
Nishi! Why won't you blame me for this?!

248
00:15:33,929 --> 00:15:36,090
I am the one who cost us the game!

249
00:15:36,115 --> 00:15:39,793
Even if you could have saved one, it'd be
pointless because I couldn't make it count-

250
00:15:39,818 --> 00:15:40,531
Asahi!

251
00:15:44,681 --> 00:15:46,847
What exactly do you mean by pointless?

252
00:15:47,341 --> 00:15:50,476
And while we're at it, why didn't
you call for the ball at the end?

253
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:53,099
Come on you were in the perfect position.

254
00:15:53,878 --> 00:15:56,015
Hey! Just lay off him, Nishinoya!

255
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,185
It was my fault for sending him
too many sets in a row before that-

256
00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:01,590
Even if you did Suga... it wouldn't have mattered anyway.

257
00:16:02,832 --> 00:16:06,072
You never know until you hit
the damn thing! You know that!

258
00:16:06,167 --> 00:16:08,702
The next spike might be the one to break through!

259
00:16:09,825 --> 00:16:10,427
Hey!

260
00:16:11,927 --> 00:16:16,120
Don't you ever give up on a ball...
not while I'm keeping it in for you!

261
00:16:16,343 --> 00:16:17,720
Noya! Take it easy!

262
00:16:18,662 --> 00:16:19,889
I am the libero!

263
00:16:19,965 --> 00:16:22,844
I am the last defense! The team needs me!

264
00:16:23,663 --> 00:16:27,140
But... I can't score us points.

265
00:16:29,347 --> 00:16:32,186
And I can't even attack either... so...

266
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:36,754
I don't care how many spikes get
blocked... I'd never blame you for that.

267
00:16:38,093 --> 00:16:41,338
But quit... and I'll never be able to forgive you!

268
00:16:48,101 --> 00:16:48,474
A...

269
00:16:48,498 --> 00:16:48,934
Asahi!

270
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:49,672
Asahi!

271
00:16:49,696 --> 00:16:50,922
Wait, don't go!

272
00:16:59,591 --> 00:17:00,019
Ah...

273
00:17:00,867 --> 00:17:03,556
Tell me... why weren't you there yesterday?

274
00:17:04,709 --> 00:17:06,128
Did you forget or something?

275
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,012
The Inter-High Tournament's coming up.

276
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:12,190
Yeah where's the fun in hitting
spikes that don't mean anything?

277
00:17:12,728 --> 00:17:15,788
What am I saying? That's not how I feel.

278
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:20,205
You must be sick of retrieving
balls for no reason... aren't you?

279
00:17:21,002 --> 00:17:24,224
Stop it. Nishinoya doesn't think that way either!

280
00:17:25,131 --> 00:17:27,822
I know Suga feels guilty every time I get blocked-

281
00:17:27,878 --> 00:17:31,053
Oh who gives a damn what anybody else thinks about it?!

282
00:17:31,548 --> 00:17:34,410
What on earth is all the racket about out here?!

283
00:17:34,582 --> 00:17:36,862
Stop shouting in the halls!

284
00:17:37,077 --> 00:17:37,894
Asahi!

285
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:38,607
Young man-

286
00:17:38,632 --> 00:17:39,751
Don't touch me!

287
00:17:43,665 --> 00:17:45,659
Uh-oh, someone's in trouble.

288
00:17:52,492 --> 00:17:54,822
Don't you want to make a spike that matters?!

289
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:58,946
Nice one, Hinata!

290
00:17:59,315 --> 00:18:00,337
Thank you!

291
00:18:00,702 --> 00:18:02,417
Hinata... It's your serve.

292
00:18:03,752 --> 00:18:04,613
I was wrong.

293
00:18:04,891 --> 00:18:05,300
Huh?

294
00:18:06,384 --> 00:18:08,447
I know I got stopped by the wall...

295
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:12,132
But I want to... I want to
keep trying to break through it.

296
00:18:15,222 --> 00:18:16,758
And that's all that matters.

297
00:18:16,783 --> 00:18:17,171
Hm?

298
00:18:17,619 --> 00:18:19,998
That was all I needed to hear from you, Asahi.

299
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:31,907
My job... is just to keep the ball in play.

300
00:18:32,957 --> 00:18:34,499
Do your best, Hinata!

301
00:18:35,535 --> 00:18:36,136
It's in!

302
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:37,017
Agh!

303
00:18:37,531 --> 00:18:39,153
My bad! Cover me!

304
00:18:39,635 --> 00:18:41,603
Hey, bun-head! Finish it off!

305
00:18:44,122 --> 00:18:46,003
The sky belongs to the spikers.

306
00:18:46,844 --> 00:18:48,654
I can't compete in their space.

307
00:18:50,892 --> 00:18:51,680
Shut him down!

308
00:18:51,705 --> 00:18:53,502
Yeah I don't take orders from you.

309
00:18:53,698 --> 00:18:55,740
Come on, man, we're playin' for keeps!

310
00:18:56,044 --> 00:18:58,387
But if I can just keep the ball up in the air...

311
00:18:58,474 --> 00:19:02,650
I know I got stopped by the wall... But
I want to keep trying to break through it.

312
00:19:02,675 --> 00:19:04,858
I know I can trust the ace to nail it.

313
00:19:09,786 --> 00:19:10,660
Damn!

314
00:19:20,148 --> 00:19:21,368
Whoa! It's up!

315
00:19:21,621 --> 00:19:22,886
Nice follow-thru!

316
00:19:24,238 --> 00:19:28,631
I focused on blocked ball retrieval, so the
ball doesn't hit the floor after they block!

317
00:19:28,688 --> 00:19:30,079
Great job, Noya!

318
00:19:33,251 --> 00:19:35,441
Even if the ball rebounds off the wall...

319
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:37,301
I will keep it in play!

320
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:43,501
So please... You have to ask the setter
for another chance, Asahi! You're the ace!

321
00:19:45,269 --> 00:19:46,221
Cover me!

322
00:19:46,245 --> 00:19:46,851
Right here!

323
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:49,780
Who do I send the ball to?

324
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,063
The left is open, so it's probably our best bet, but...

325
00:19:54,351 --> 00:19:56,438
what if I cause Asahi to get blocked again?

326
00:19:57,546 --> 00:19:58,393
Sugawara!

327
00:19:59,066 --> 00:20:02,289
Keep throwing it to him... Until he scores!

328
00:20:02,314 --> 00:20:04,150
Oh that's just cruel, your majesty.

329
00:20:04,175 --> 00:20:05,060
Quiet!

330
00:20:06,369 --> 00:20:09,327
When the chips are down and the
receives are all over the place,

331
00:20:09,566 --> 00:20:12,100
you're supposed to trust the ace with the last ball.

332
00:20:13,011 --> 00:20:15,419
I know that... but still...

333
00:20:17,053 --> 00:20:21,576
I can't send Asahi a ball he's not
expecting and make him deal with a triple block.

334
00:20:23,928 --> 00:20:29,201
A spiker can only go for a kill...
After a setter sends him the ball.

335
00:20:30,258 --> 00:20:34,175
Please... let me set for you one more time, okay?

336
00:20:36,544 --> 00:20:41,088
And the set only exists because
the libero kept the ball in play.

337
00:20:41,113 --> 00:20:45,345
Don't ever give up on a ball...
Not while I'm keeping it in for you!

338
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:51,502
So when I go to do my job, I'm not alone.

339
00:20:53,952 --> 00:20:58,629
Everyone else was doing theirs, but I... I...

340
00:20:58,853 --> 00:21:01,191
It's impossible to win all by yourself.

341
00:21:01,456 --> 00:21:04,654
I mean, come on. That is why they call you the ace!

342
00:21:04,947 --> 00:21:06,991
Because if you still love volleyball...

343
00:21:07,205 --> 00:21:11,819
You have to ask the setter for
another chance, Asahi! You're the ace!

344
00:21:14,169 --> 00:21:15,071
I'm free!

345
00:21:16,058 --> 00:21:16,602
Shimada!

346
00:21:16,627 --> 00:21:21,569
Sugaaaaaaa!

347
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,575
Over here!

348
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:34,147
Right... our ace is waiting.
He wants me to send it his way.

349
00:21:37,003 --> 00:21:39,463
I'll set high, not too far from the net.

350
00:21:40,527 --> 00:21:44,157
Asahi's favorite toss, the one
I've given him so many times.

351
00:21:46,101 --> 00:21:49,997
It's a simple one, but I'll send
it with as much accuracy as I can.

352
00:21:50,533 --> 00:21:53,001
Why would you bother encouraging them to do that?

353
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:54,711
You know we have to block him.

354
00:21:54,797 --> 00:21:57,579
Obviously, it's meaningless if we just let him through.

355
00:22:02,819 --> 00:22:04,317
My team has my back.

356
00:22:05,016 --> 00:22:08,137
And my setter knows exactly what works best for me.

357
00:22:09,035 --> 00:22:10,204
Who could ask for more?

358
00:22:10,635 --> 00:22:12,174
Somewhere along the way...

359
00:22:12,509 --> 00:22:16,598
I let myself forget the most simple
and natural thing about this game.

360
00:22:18,138 --> 00:22:20,260
That I'll never have to fight alone!

361
00:22:22,356 --> 00:22:24,065
I will land this hit.

362
00:22:38,372 --> 00:22:40,616
Because I'm the ace!

363
00:24:14,071 --> 00:24:17,479
Tanaka, would you stop crying
and focus on blocking, please?

364
00:24:17,526 --> 00:24:20,174
What?! I-I'm not crying, stupid! This is just...

365
00:24:20,199 --> 00:24:22,516
Right, it's sweat, you've said that a thousand times.

366
00:24:22,547 --> 00:24:24,241
It's just a runny nose.

367
00:24:24,266 --> 00:24:27,098
Whatever. Next Haikyu!! "The dream".
