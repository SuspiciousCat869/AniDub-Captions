1
00:00:04,537 --> 00:00:07,246
Hey... Welcome back, Oikawa.

2
00:00:08,198 --> 00:00:09,397
How's that leg doing?

3
00:00:13,254 --> 00:00:16,477
Never been better! Glad I can come back to practice now...

4
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:18,320
It was just a tiny sprain.

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,196
Listen, son... don't ever do that again!

6
00:00:21,394 --> 00:00:25,956
They brought Kageyama like we asked them to, so
we can't just show up without our official setter...

7
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:27,856
That would make us look bad.

8
00:00:28,007 --> 00:00:29,041
I'm sorry.

9
00:00:29,142 --> 00:00:32,407
Careful, Oikawa! Please don't hurt yourself!

10
00:00:34,686 --> 00:00:37,688
Hey, it might be because he's
got all the ladies' attention...

11
00:00:37,713 --> 00:00:39,540
But I already hate this guy.

12
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:41,748
Yeah that's Seijoh's team captain.

13
00:00:43,033 --> 00:00:46,231
Oikawa. A super offensive setter.

14
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:48,860
Top of his class in attacking and team play.

15
00:00:49,895 --> 00:00:53,665
If he thinks this guy is good, then... hmm...

16
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:55,816
Yeah... and he's got a bad attitude too.

17
00:00:55,841 --> 00:00:57,527
What? Is it worse than yours?!

18
00:00:57,552 --> 00:00:59,236
Even worse than four-eyes.

19
00:00:59,261 --> 00:01:00,625
That is bad!

20
00:01:01,527 --> 00:01:04,868
Since you know him, I guess he
must've also gone to Kitagawa first, huh?

21
00:01:04,964 --> 00:01:07,683
Yeah. He was my upperclassman.

22
00:01:08,288 --> 00:01:11,464
If he's above the king, then he's...

23
00:01:12,381 --> 00:01:13,449
the great king?!

24
00:01:13,928 --> 00:01:16,746
Hey there! Long time no see, Kageyama!

25
00:02:48,833 --> 00:02:52,802
How long has it been since I saw you? You've really grown!

26
00:02:52,871 --> 00:02:54,447
How's it feel to be the king?

27
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:58,867
He's good... I learned everything I
know about serving and blocking from him.

28
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,365
Do not underestimate him.

29
00:03:01,769 --> 00:03:03,966
He must've invented that killer serve.

30
00:03:03,991 --> 00:03:06,736
Still... for now we should stay focused on the game...

31
00:03:06,761 --> 00:03:08,256
We are gonna take that last set!

32
00:03:08,281 --> 00:03:09,145
Y-yeah!

33
00:03:09,358 --> 00:03:11,293
Tanaka, stop with the faces!

34
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:16,024
Now get over there and warm up! And be extra
thorough so you don't get yourself injured again!

35
00:03:16,244 --> 00:03:17,002
Alright.

36
00:03:19,696 --> 00:03:21,127
I'm gonna kill this guy!

37
00:03:24,132 --> 00:03:27,115
Come on, when are they gonna let Oikawa play?

38
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:31,264
No he can't go in yet. If he doesn't warm
up first, he might hurt his beautiful body.

39
00:03:31,338 --> 00:03:33,584
Oh nooo, that would be awful!

40
00:03:33,638 --> 00:03:34,616
I know, right?

41
00:03:35,753 --> 00:03:37,279
Comin' atcha!

42
00:03:44,513 --> 00:03:45,930
One more point.

43
00:03:46,536 --> 00:03:47,613
That's all we need.

44
00:03:48,088 --> 00:03:50,870
We might just win against a top 4 team!

45
00:03:52,449 --> 00:03:54,209
Don't start getting cocky yet!

46
00:03:54,617 --> 00:03:55,322
Yes!

47
00:03:55,347 --> 00:03:56,545
Nice, Kindaichi!

48
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:58,061
It's alright. Shake it off!

49
00:04:00,292 --> 00:04:03,084
Uh-oh. Looks like we're in trouble.

50
00:04:03,573 --> 00:04:04,529
You warmed up?

51
00:04:05,277 --> 00:04:06,713
I'm ready anytime.

52
00:04:09,627 --> 00:04:11,513
Just leave everything to me, okay?

53
00:04:11,538 --> 00:04:12,125
Right.

54
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:15,151
Ahhh... it's the great king!

55
00:04:15,176 --> 00:04:15,776
Cut that out!

56
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,145
Bleeehhhh!

57
00:04:19,222 --> 00:04:21,061
Wait, are they swapping our setter out?

58
00:04:21,382 --> 00:04:23,652
He's not the setter. He was filling in.

59
00:04:23,677 --> 00:04:24,836
You're up, Oikawa!

60
00:04:26,395 --> 00:04:29,046
Doesn't matter how powerful their attacks are.

61
00:04:29,957 --> 00:04:33,335
If they never make a solid connection
with the ball... Then what's the point?

62
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:37,335
What?

63
00:04:45,667 --> 00:04:45,932
Huh?

64
00:04:45,957 --> 00:04:47,559
He's targeting Tsukishima!

65
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:50,412
Tsukki!

66
00:04:53,461 --> 00:04:56,351
I just started watching, but looks like I was right.

67
00:04:56,576 --> 00:04:59,083
Number 6... and number 5.

68
00:04:59,107 --> 00:04:59,975
Uwah!

69
00:05:00,192 --> 00:05:03,339
You two must be first-years. Your receives are terrible.

70
00:05:05,015 --> 00:05:07,325
His momentum's even better than Kageyama's.

71
00:05:07,467 --> 00:05:10,257
And he's got the control to
land the ball anywhere he chooses.

72
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:11,759
This guy's really good.

73
00:05:12,204 --> 00:05:13,738
So that's Seijoh's captain.

74
00:05:14,667 --> 00:05:16,177
Now... one more time.

75
00:05:21,838 --> 00:05:23,161
Poor Tsukki!

76
00:05:23,817 --> 00:05:24,592
Damn.

77
00:05:25,986 --> 00:05:27,473
Don't worry about it, guys!

78
00:05:28,272 --> 00:05:33,517
Tsukishima's a jerk and he gets on my
nerves... but for some reason... grrr...

79
00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:36,045
Ah, just one more point to tie.

80
00:05:36,747 --> 00:05:38,708
Hey, great king!

81
00:05:38,733 --> 00:05:43,497
Why don't you aim for me?! I can take it! Just aim
the ball right at my head! Unless you're too scared!

82
00:05:43,522 --> 00:05:45,597
Stop it, you're acting like a toddler!

83
00:05:45,622 --> 00:05:46,653
Excuse me?!

84
00:05:46,897 --> 00:05:51,944
This freakin' guy always knows what to
say to make me mad... but, but still...!

85
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:55,845
Listen up! The cool thing about volleyball
is... The cool thing about volleyball is...

86
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:59,952
Everybody you see on this side of
the net is your ally, okay Tsukishima?!

87
00:06:00,905 --> 00:06:03,003
Wise words from a wise guy!

88
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:07,984
Okay... let's fall back as a group...
Tsukishima, you stay close to the sideline.

89
00:06:08,246 --> 00:06:08,701
Right.

90
00:06:09,964 --> 00:06:11,307
Now... let's go!

91
00:06:12,362 --> 00:06:17,598
Oooh... the captain is the strongest
receiver, and now he's expanding his defense zone.

92
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,545
One more!

93
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:22,144
Still... it takes more than one
player to defend the whole court!

94
00:06:22,578 --> 00:06:23,111
Argh!

95
00:06:23,792 --> 00:06:26,498
How can he pinpoint someone who's so far away?!

96
00:06:26,523 --> 00:06:29,545
But he's emphasizing control,
so the momentum should be slower!

97
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:32,092
It's up!

98
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:33,791
You're awesome, Tsukki!

99
00:06:33,816 --> 00:06:35,854
Oh, you got it! Niiiiice!

100
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:38,238
I guess I made it too easy... oh well.

101
00:06:38,485 --> 00:06:40,877
You guys did just gave us a little gift though.

102
00:06:40,902 --> 00:06:41,910
Agh dammit!

103
00:06:42,419 --> 00:06:45,322
Oh my... look at that delicious chance ball...

104
00:06:45,517 --> 00:06:47,257
Don't mind if we do, thank you!

105
00:06:47,818 --> 00:06:48,533
I got it!

106
00:06:48,558 --> 00:06:51,635
Uh-oh, this rotation doesn't
give us enough blocking height...

107
00:06:53,595 --> 00:06:54,453
Kindaichi!

108
00:06:54,477 --> 00:06:56,449
Alright, I shook off all the blockers,

109
00:06:58,381 --> 00:06:59,834
where'd the shorty come from?!

110
00:07:01,622 --> 00:07:02,207
There it goes!

111
00:07:02,231 --> 00:07:03,040
Nice one-touch, pal!

112
00:07:03,073 --> 00:07:03,964
Chance ball!

113
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:07,070
Just wait, carrot-top, next time I'm gonna smack you down!

114
00:07:10,194 --> 00:07:14,538
If you miss Hinata by even the smallest
instant, he'll be impossible to catch.

115
00:07:15,118 --> 00:07:17,288
The only thing that can keep up with him...

116
00:07:17,535 --> 00:07:18,568
is the ball!

117
00:07:44,145 --> 00:07:45,100
What was that?

118
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,719
That guy moved across the court in a split second.

119
00:07:47,744 --> 00:07:50,156
The ball flew straight into his hand like a magnet.

120
00:07:52,983 --> 00:07:54,677
Aww yeah!

121
00:07:55,459 --> 00:07:56,053
Line up!

122
00:07:58,694 --> 00:07:59,682
Is there something wrong?

123
00:08:00,386 --> 00:08:01,502
Incredible...

124
00:08:01,686 --> 00:08:02,790
Oh yeah, that's right!

125
00:08:02,992 --> 00:08:06,769
I guess this is the first time you've seen
Hinata and Kageyama's special attack in action...

126
00:08:06,849 --> 00:08:10,184
It's pretty cool, huh? In fact,
it's so cool it kinda freaks me out!

127
00:08:10,384 --> 00:08:10,871
Huh?

128
00:08:11,273 --> 00:08:11,914
We're ready!

129
00:08:11,938 --> 00:08:12,521
Ready!

130
00:08:13,697 --> 00:08:15,351
You're supposed to give them some feedback.

131
00:08:15,376 --> 00:08:17,169
Oh, sorry, I didn't know.

132
00:08:17,487 --> 00:08:18,315
Lemme see...

133
00:08:18,838 --> 00:08:23,281
Like I said... I don't know that
much about volleyball... but still!

134
00:08:24,113 --> 00:08:27,522
I can tell something really
great is starting to take shape.

135
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:29,993
Huh?

136
00:08:30,481 --> 00:08:34,059
We've just had some really
gifted first-years join the team...

137
00:08:34,348 --> 00:08:38,173
And things didn't run so smoothly at first... but now...

138
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:42,787
I think I understand why! Even
if everyone doesn't always agree...

139
00:08:43,622 --> 00:08:47,432
Whenever people are brought together...
It creates a chemical reaction.

140
00:08:47,983 --> 00:08:52,857
Somewhere in the world, there's a fateful
encounter happening at this very moment.

141
00:08:53,496 --> 00:08:57,638
It could be happening somewhere far
away in a completely different country...

142
00:08:57,904 --> 00:08:59,770
Or on the other side of the globe.

143
00:09:00,579 --> 00:09:05,282
Or maybe... it's on a small eastern
island... In a tiny northern town...

144
00:09:05,687 --> 00:09:09,844
In an ordinary high school...
In a regular volleyball club.

145
00:09:11,588 --> 00:09:14,697
I believe that encounter was made at Karasuno.

146
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:19,494
I don't have any proof yet...
But I can't ignore what I believe!

147
00:09:20,089 --> 00:09:25,233
And before too long, this team
is going to become even stronger.

148
00:09:28,814 --> 00:09:29,965
Uh...

149
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:33,084
I'm sorry! That was too weird, wasn't it?! I'll stop!

150
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:35,296
No no no, that was great, Takeda!

151
00:09:35,818 --> 00:09:36,461
Thanks!

152
00:09:36,486 --> 00:09:37,247
Thank you!

153
00:09:37,892 --> 00:09:39,487
Uh... sure.

154
00:09:44,385 --> 00:09:45,106
Kindaichi.

155
00:09:55,299 --> 00:09:57,943
We cannot deal with Kageyama anymore, coach!

156
00:09:58,428 --> 00:10:00,718
I know he's got amazing attack power and everything...

157
00:10:00,758 --> 00:10:03,528
But he's obviously been holding the whole team back!

158
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:05,673
Seriously...

159
00:10:06,525 --> 00:10:07,652
Better off without him.

160
00:10:13,441 --> 00:10:14,185
Hey uh...

161
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:15,820
Don't even apologize to me!

162
00:10:17,326 --> 00:10:18,974
And I'm not going to either!

163
00:10:20,235 --> 00:10:21,056
Okay.

164
00:10:21,171 --> 00:10:24,758
To me, you're always gonna be that
self-centered, pain-in-the-ass king of the court,

165
00:10:24,783 --> 00:10:27,916
the number-one person on earth I want to defeat one day!

166
00:10:29,349 --> 00:10:30,015
Fine.

167
00:10:30,585 --> 00:10:31,703
So don't ruin that!

168
00:10:31,728 --> 00:10:32,152
Fine.

169
00:10:32,404 --> 00:10:36,252
There's no need for the two of us to make
up... I mean we were never friends to start with!

170
00:10:36,277 --> 00:10:36,673
Fine.

171
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:39,723
But next time we meet...

172
00:10:40,019 --> 00:10:41,152
I will win!

173
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:48,052
Yeah well...

174
00:10:48,242 --> 00:10:50,852
Time to go wash up, oh yeah!

175
00:10:50,877 --> 00:10:54,661
You can call me Shoyo, future ace of Karasunooo-

176
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,117
whoa, it's about to go down! Are they gonna fight?

177
00:11:00,227 --> 00:11:02,503
I should probably stay away from something like that...

178
00:11:02,528 --> 00:11:03,241
Kindaichi.

179
00:11:04,219 --> 00:11:05,672
The next time you and I meet...

180
00:11:05,848 --> 00:11:07,158
We're gonna beat you again.

181
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:16,518
Hm? Hey, what was that all about?

182
00:11:17,153 --> 00:11:20,164
He just... used the word "we".

183
00:11:20,251 --> 00:11:20,735
Huh?

184
00:11:21,072 --> 00:11:21,997
Are you crying?

185
00:11:22,225 --> 00:11:26,817
Until now, it was always "I" this "me"
that. Like he was on a team by himself.

186
00:11:27,689 --> 00:11:29,363
Agh... you idiotttt!

187
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:30,907
Have...

188
00:11:32,575 --> 00:11:34,075
Have I already lost?

189
00:11:36,993 --> 00:11:38,746
Ow! What was that for?!

190
00:11:40,365 --> 00:11:42,092
Thank you for playing with us!

191
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:45,874
Takeda's right, but...

192
00:11:46,367 --> 00:11:51,796
If we ever want to play and win a real game
against Seijoh with Oikawa in the setter position.

193
00:11:51,821 --> 00:11:54,080
We're still missing a vital ingredient.

194
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,237
Wow.. Very well said captain.

195
00:11:58,787 --> 00:12:00,556
That's surprisingly astute.

196
00:12:03,179 --> 00:12:04,966
Look out it's the great king again!

197
00:12:05,302 --> 00:12:06,069
What's your damage?

198
00:12:06,093 --> 00:12:06,849
Gotta problem?

199
00:12:06,874 --> 00:12:07,922
Wanna knuckle sandwich?!

200
00:12:07,947 --> 00:12:09,047
Yeah, let's rumble!

201
00:12:09,345 --> 00:12:12,613
Ah, come now, no need to get yourselves worked up.

202
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:14,269
But hey, short stuff.

203
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:17,752
That one-touch and broad jump
were great... you should be proud.

204
00:12:17,784 --> 00:12:19,211
Huh? Oh...

205
00:12:20,542 --> 00:12:23,610
Next time, we should try doing
things full-out from the start.

206
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:26,551
You haven't seen our real setup.

207
00:12:27,368 --> 00:12:30,896
But don't worry... we'll be working
on perfecting our serves 'til then.

208
00:12:31,567 --> 00:12:33,607
That's true, it'll be different.

209
00:12:34,477 --> 00:12:37,258
Next time we'll be dealing with his serves the whole game.

210
00:12:39,548 --> 00:12:44,044
That combination attack is pretty effective,
but you're going to run out of steam at some point.

211
00:12:44,146 --> 00:12:45,896
You need to improve your receives.

212
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:50,170
After all, I'm not the only person who does power serves.

213
00:12:51,429 --> 00:12:54,786
The Inter-High Tournaments are coming
up, and I want you to make the cut.

214
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,060
Listen carefully...

215
00:12:58,326 --> 00:13:01,792
My special protege... I want
to crush you fair and square...

216
00:13:01,897 --> 00:13:04,464
At an official game, where we both play the setter!

217
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,197
Yeah well... we can train to receive, fancy-pants!

218
00:13:07,222 --> 00:13:08,412
Hey, let me go!

219
00:13:08,708 --> 00:13:12,111
Just so you know, receives aren't
something you can master overnight.

220
00:13:13,407 --> 00:13:15,479
I'm sure your captain can attest to that.

221
00:13:16,599 --> 00:13:21,258
If we happen to meet again at the tournament...
I look forward to seeing all your improvement.

222
00:13:22,991 --> 00:13:24,887
Look.. Do not let him get to you...

223
00:13:25,006 --> 00:13:28,302
Antagonizing people is just one of
those things he likes to do, so...

224
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:34,728
He's right... we don't have a
whole lot of time until then...

225
00:13:34,938 --> 00:13:37,621
But... luckily we have someone coming back soon.

226
00:13:38,647 --> 00:13:39,784
Who's coming back?

227
00:13:41,447 --> 00:13:43,937
Karasuno's... guardian.

228
00:13:45,028 --> 00:13:47,695
Karasuno's... guardian?

229
00:14:04,489 --> 00:14:06,407
Kageyama's getting really good, huh?

230
00:14:06,954 --> 00:14:12,202
Yeah. He's a prodigy who's finally found himself
an outlet for his very specific set of abilities...

231
00:14:12,227 --> 00:14:14,486
The average player's no match for him now.

232
00:14:14,723 --> 00:14:17,153
Wait, are you saying you're not a match for him either?

233
00:14:17,415 --> 00:14:22,161
Not for his sets... When it comes to that,
no one in the prefecture can out do Kageyama.

234
00:14:22,297 --> 00:14:26,791
I'm every bit as good as him at spikes,
blocks and serves though... ow, what the-?!

235
00:14:26,996 --> 00:14:29,886
You know damn well your sets are as good as his too!

236
00:14:29,911 --> 00:14:31,672
That is why you're our setter!

237
00:14:31,728 --> 00:14:33,910
Sorry... but it's the truth, okay?

238
00:14:34,037 --> 00:14:36,746
Which is why we're going to sabotage their receiving...

239
00:14:36,814 --> 00:14:39,349
Because no matter how perfectly they can catch a serve,

240
00:14:39,373 --> 00:14:41,967
it's all for naught if it
doesn't make it back to the setter.

241
00:14:42,071 --> 00:14:44,722
If we get matched with Karasuno in a real game...

242
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:49,427
We'll have to ruin all of their receives so
Kageyama never gets to make one of those flawless sets!

243
00:14:49,452 --> 00:14:51,187
They can't just rely on just one person to win!

244
00:14:51,212 --> 00:14:54,104
Ah, I'm already looking forward
to cheering them up after they lose!

245
00:14:54,998 --> 00:14:57,809
What? Didn't you say you hated him for being a genius?

246
00:14:57,834 --> 00:15:01,062
Not as much as I hate pretty-boys
like you who get all the girls!

247
00:15:01,158 --> 00:15:04,324
Ow! Prejudice like that isn't very
becoming on you, my friend! Ow! Oww! Stop it!

248
00:15:04,369 --> 00:15:07,731
Hey, cut that out or the coach's
gonna us one of his lectures again!

249
00:15:09,339 --> 00:15:10,448
Good job, guys!

250
00:15:10,866 --> 00:15:13,685
Now let's do a little light cleaning and call it a day!

251
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:14,615
Yes sir!

252
00:15:15,356 --> 00:15:16,156
Watch it!

253
00:15:16,363 --> 00:15:18,532
Thanks a bunch for setting everything up, Takeda.

254
00:15:18,557 --> 00:15:20,705
Don't mention it. You guys did a great job!

255
00:15:20,729 --> 00:15:24,702
I still can't believe we won against
a prestigious team like Aoba Johsai!

256
00:15:25,338 --> 00:15:27,287
Yeah, but the fight is just beginning.

257
00:15:27,473 --> 00:15:27,900
Huh?

258
00:15:28,336 --> 00:15:31,234
I mean... thanks to that combo technique of ours...

259
00:15:31,436 --> 00:15:33,197
We can put up a pretty good offense.

260
00:15:33,808 --> 00:15:38,279
But if Hinata gets caught by blockers and
our receivers aren't up to par like today,

261
00:15:38,303 --> 00:15:40,326
we won't have a strong enough defense.

262
00:15:40,468 --> 00:15:44,244
And besides... we uh don't really have a coach... so uh...

263
00:15:44,477 --> 00:15:47,470
When it comes to that kind of
advice... you're not all that much help.

264
00:15:47,572 --> 00:15:48,553
You have a point.

265
00:15:48,586 --> 00:15:50,159
Oh! That came out wrong!

266
00:15:50,481 --> 00:15:52,749
I promise I wasn't saying you're not doing a good job!

267
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:55,159
I didn't take it that way...

268
00:15:55,184 --> 00:15:58,167
Leave the coach problem to me. I have someone in mind.

269
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,678
Huh? Do you really? Who is it?

270
00:16:01,235 --> 00:16:04,839
Well, it's someone I've tried and
failed to win over several times now...

271
00:16:05,477 --> 00:16:07,249
but I'm sure I'll think of something.

272
00:16:08,651 --> 00:16:10,922
Do you mind locking up when you guys are done today?

273
00:16:10,947 --> 00:16:11,652
Yeah, sure.

274
00:16:13,654 --> 00:16:15,895
Whoa, I think take's starting to take charge.

275
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:16,753
Mm-hm...

276
00:16:19,548 --> 00:16:20,774
Hm? It's broken...

277
00:16:21,093 --> 00:16:23,900
Hey, can I throw away this
mop? Someone might get a splinter.

278
00:16:24,147 --> 00:16:26,524
Huh? No, it's fine! Just leave it!

279
00:16:27,851 --> 00:16:29,606
I'm sure that it can be fixed somehow.

280
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:31,119
Huh?

281
00:16:35,908 --> 00:16:36,640
Good night!

282
00:16:37,306 --> 00:16:38,030
Night!

283
00:16:39,969 --> 00:16:40,843
Meat buns?

284
00:16:41,225 --> 00:16:44,019
Sorry boys, the soccer geeks just bought up all I had...

285
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,205
I know life is so unfair.

286
00:16:46,486 --> 00:16:47,437
I'm hungry!

287
00:16:47,462 --> 00:16:49,368
Yeah, where's your manager?!

288
00:16:49,393 --> 00:16:52,718
I am the manager! Now get your
butts home and eat some real food!

289
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,332
Build up a little muscle!

290
00:16:56,622 --> 00:16:57,145
Here.

291
00:17:00,695 --> 00:17:01,516
Wow!

292
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:02,937
Thanks!

293
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,367
Now go eat your dinners.

294
00:17:04,392 --> 00:17:06,209
Woohoo!

295
00:17:08,383 --> 00:17:08,960
Ugh...

296
00:17:11,049 --> 00:17:12,129
Sakanoshita.

297
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,165
Not givin' up, eh?

298
00:17:19,473 --> 00:17:20,607
That was nuts.

299
00:17:21,127 --> 00:17:23,387
I can't believe how good that guy's serves were...

300
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:26,127
It's a good thing he didn't show up until the final set.

301
00:17:26,357 --> 00:17:29,050
Makes sense that he came from Kageyama's middle school.

302
00:17:29,668 --> 00:17:31,388
Huh? Hang on.

303
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:34,301
Why'd you pick our school anyway, Kageyama?

304
00:17:34,654 --> 00:17:35,143
Hm?

305
00:17:35,484 --> 00:17:39,501
Shiratorizawa's got the best team in the
whole prefecture. Why didn't you just go there?

306
00:17:39,526 --> 00:17:40,612
Shira-huh?

307
00:17:40,766 --> 00:17:42,946
How have you never heard of Shiratorizawa?

308
00:17:43,029 --> 00:17:47,429
Those guys have got unbelievable skills. They
rank in the top 8 in the whole country every year!

309
00:17:47,454 --> 00:17:48,326
Whoaa!

310
00:17:49,472 --> 00:17:51,266
Oh yeah, I didn't make it in there.

311
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:52,392
No way!

312
00:17:52,417 --> 00:17:56,614
Well I didn't get a recommendation from them, so I
had to take the entrance exam and ended up failing it...

313
00:17:56,639 --> 00:17:58,526
Their test is some pure nonsense.

314
00:17:58,551 --> 00:18:00,431
Passing their exam is extremely hard...

315
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:02,118
I'd say almost impossible.

316
00:18:02,306 --> 00:18:05,922
Aww... or maybe the king
doesn't have a head for academics.

317
00:18:05,947 --> 00:18:06,342
Goodnight!

318
00:18:06,367 --> 00:18:06,781
Tch!

319
00:18:06,949 --> 00:18:08,680
Why did you pick Karasuno?

320
00:18:08,705 --> 00:18:11,651
Let me guess, you want to be
like the tiny giant too don't'cha!

321
00:18:11,866 --> 00:18:15,519
No, I picked this school because I heard
that coach Ukai might come out of retirement.

322
00:18:16,013 --> 00:18:16,873
Ukai?

323
00:18:17,239 --> 00:18:22,181
He's the best coach we've ever had! He made a
name for Karasuno by getting us to Spring Nationals!

324
00:18:22,206 --> 00:18:22,959
Really?!

325
00:18:23,663 --> 00:18:27,026
Yeah dude, some people even
call him the "crazy crow coach"...

326
00:18:27,114 --> 00:18:29,440
You know, since our school name kinda means "crow".

327
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:33,339
Yeah, the second- and third-years got a
little bit of instruction from him last year...

328
00:18:33,364 --> 00:18:35,058
But it was pretty basic and spartan.

329
00:18:36,796 --> 00:18:37,996
Why are you jealous of that?

330
00:18:39,311 --> 00:18:42,195
At one point they were planning
on formally reinstating him, but...

331
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:43,521
He collapsed?!

332
00:18:43,546 --> 00:18:46,775
Sorry, but the school's not planning
on bringing him back anytime soon.

333
00:18:47,495 --> 00:18:50,019
I don't care... no matter what school I go to...

334
00:18:50,177 --> 00:18:54,125
I'm still going up against high school
students... And I'm still gonna win.

335
00:18:54,337 --> 00:18:57,636
Look at this guy acting all
cool, you not foolin' anyone, buddy.

336
00:18:57,717 --> 00:18:58,368
Pffff!

337
00:18:58,392 --> 00:18:59,429
Don't be stupid!

338
00:18:59,454 --> 00:19:03,945
I'm not trying to act cool at all! We did
beat one of the top 4 schools today, didn't we?!

339
00:19:04,136 --> 00:19:07,159
That's true... two to one against Aoba Johsai High..

340
00:19:07,184 --> 00:19:10,488
And thanks to my boy Hinata
here... I got to score one unmarked!

341
00:19:10,513 --> 00:19:11,750
Sure thing my man!

342
00:19:12,242 --> 00:19:14,236
So, you've made your debut now.

343
00:19:14,499 --> 00:19:15,492
How did it feel?

344
00:19:27,819 --> 00:19:31,225
On the other hand, you were losin' your
shit for the whole first set, remember?

345
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:35,212
Yeah, and you lost just as many points as
you scored, so don't go getting too cocky okay.

346
00:19:35,237 --> 00:19:37,426
Come on why do you guys have to bait him like that?!

347
00:19:37,695 --> 00:19:38,672
He's got a point though.

348
00:19:38,696 --> 00:19:39,072
Huh?

349
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,859
Our team's still lacking. And in a lot of ways...

350
00:19:41,884 --> 00:19:43,814
We might've won, but only just barely.

351
00:19:43,839 --> 00:19:45,990
Okay, I'll practice myself crazy!

352
00:19:46,015 --> 00:19:48,937
Whoa, whoa! Self-improvement is really important.

353
00:19:49,228 --> 00:19:53,357
But... The main issue here is that
Karasuno still needs a few more players.

354
00:19:53,382 --> 00:19:53,829
Huh?

355
00:19:53,932 --> 00:19:55,039
Yeah, I would agree.

356
00:19:56,336 --> 00:19:58,860
We need a natural libero... And also...

357
00:19:59,203 --> 00:20:03,014
It would be really handy to have an ace
spiker who can handle a triple block too.

358
00:20:03,128 --> 00:20:04,811
Hey! I can be the ace spiker!

359
00:20:04,836 --> 00:20:07,544
You can't! You're supposed to be the decoy, remember?!

360
00:20:10,642 --> 00:20:13,178
But you said our guardian would come back soon, right?

361
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,578
Yeah. Karasuno may not be the strongest
team, but we're not the weakest either.

362
00:20:17,868 --> 00:20:20,138
Look, we used to have really skilled players..

363
00:20:20,199 --> 00:20:23,058
But we failed to make sure
they trained their replacements.

364
00:20:24,929 --> 00:20:26,750
Well now we've got players again...

365
00:20:27,213 --> 00:20:29,678
Plus we've recruited a few first-year guys.

366
00:20:30,744 --> 00:20:32,921
We just need to coordinate all our strengths.

367
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:35,541
Summer Inter-High Tourney.

368
00:20:36,626 --> 00:20:39,024
The nationals aren't some unreachable goal...

369
00:20:39,387 --> 00:20:43,283
If we work hard and play our cards
right, I'm positive we can get there!

370
00:20:43,308 --> 00:20:45,987
Right, the Summer Inter-High Tourney, I know about that!

371
00:20:46,206 --> 00:20:46,881
So...

372
00:20:47,213 --> 00:20:50,740
The libero you said should be coming
back soon, where has he been all this time?

373
00:20:50,859 --> 00:20:57,624
Uhh... yeah.. He's been serving a week of suspension,
plus he got banned from all club activities for a month.

374
00:20:57,719 --> 00:20:58,281
Hm?

375
00:20:58,566 --> 00:21:00,498
So is he some kind of troublemaker?!

376
00:21:00,523 --> 00:21:06,065
Dude, no... he just gets carried away sometimes.
He's a stand-up guy though. Trust me on that.

377
00:21:06,369 --> 00:21:09,857
If Tanaka thinks he gets carried
away, that's saying something.

378
00:21:09,881 --> 00:21:10,788
And check this out.

379
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:14,346
He's known as the resident genius of the volleyball club.

380
00:21:14,934 --> 00:21:20,298
But I guess now that we have smart-ass Kageyama on the
team, he won't get to keep that nickname anymore, will he?

381
00:21:22,019 --> 00:21:25,430
Do us a favor once he's back...
Call him your "upperclassman".

382
00:21:25,987 --> 00:21:28,552
He gets a stupid kick out of it like Tanaka does.

383
00:21:28,648 --> 00:21:30,029
Hey, it's not stupid!

384
00:21:32,619 --> 00:21:35,135
I can't wait to see what our team's guardian is like.

385
00:21:35,385 --> 00:21:36,737
Get a move on!

386
00:21:36,761 --> 00:21:38,790
Ah! Alright I'm coming!

387
00:21:54,307 --> 00:21:55,295
I'm gonna hit it!

388
00:21:58,176 --> 00:21:58,669
Agh!

389
00:21:58,784 --> 00:22:00,081
Gwah!

390
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:03,919
Can't you stay out of my way for five minutes?!

391
00:22:04,238 --> 00:22:06,187
I could've had that if not for you!

392
00:22:06,212 --> 00:22:07,401
Yeah well I got it!

393
00:22:07,426 --> 00:22:09,796
You didn't get anything! It's out of bounds!

394
00:22:10,335 --> 00:22:10,959
Whatever.

395
00:22:10,984 --> 00:22:11,800
Jeez.

396
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:18,856
This time for sure!

397
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:20,389
Huh?

398
00:22:29,705 --> 00:22:34,458
He redirected its momentum and rotation,
sending it straight to the setter position.

399
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,485
A perfect receive.

400
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:41,430
Are you shorter than me?!

401
00:24:14,949 --> 00:24:18,055
Who the heck is that?! He just swooped in out of nowhere!

402
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,271
That receive was so smooth and flawless!

403
00:24:20,295 --> 00:24:21,528
I think I'm gonna cry!

404
00:24:21,553 --> 00:24:23,608
Well, I guess I should introduce you guys.

405
00:24:24,243 --> 00:24:27,573
Next Haikyu!! "The one they call The Ace."

406
00:24:30,015 --> 00:24:31,383
I think I'm gonna cry!

407
00:24:31,483 --> 00:24:33,485
Well, I guess I should introduce you guys.

408
00:24:33,586 --> 00:24:37,823
Next Haikyu!! "The one they call the ace."
