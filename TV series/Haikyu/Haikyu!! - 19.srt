1
00:00:23,911 --> 00:00:24,817
That's rough!

2
00:00:24,842 --> 00:00:27,106
Yeah, that makes the 4th service ace in a row.

3
00:00:28,201 --> 00:00:32,904
He's obviously got quite a lot of
power... but that control is simply unreal.

4
00:00:33,043 --> 00:00:35,373
Okay... but if we can deal with that serve...

5
00:00:36,477 --> 00:00:38,693
It's true that his serve is nasty...

6
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:42,092
but the worst thing is, we don't
know anything about him as a setter.

7
00:00:42,117 --> 00:00:43,186
One more, like that!

8
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:52,312
Ooooooolé!

9
00:00:53,187 --> 00:00:53,798
Sorry!

10
00:00:53,838 --> 00:00:54,604
Chance ball!

11
00:00:54,948 --> 00:00:55,846
I got this one!

12
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:57,926
Okay!

13
00:00:58,646 --> 00:01:00,585
Yeah, the thing about setters...

14
00:01:02,643 --> 00:01:05,030
They're a lot like conductors for an orchestra.

15
00:01:06,161 --> 00:01:08,892
You can have the same song and the same musicians...

16
00:01:10,102 --> 00:01:13,368
but changing the conductor
gives you a whole different sound.

17
00:02:56,006 --> 00:02:59,483
Aoba‐Johsai... Their teamwork seems to be really polished.

18
00:03:00,281 --> 00:03:02,218
See that Number 4 on the left side?

19
00:03:02,702 --> 00:03:04,584
That is Hajime Iwaizumi.

20
00:03:06,178 --> 00:03:08,693
I heard he's played with Oikawa since elementary school.

21
00:03:09,167 --> 00:03:11,251
They have almost a psychic connection.

22
00:03:11,644 --> 00:03:14,795
I don't think the vibe's different
because the junior setter they used

23
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:18,120
during the practice game a while back
was no good or anything like that...

24
00:03:18,522 --> 00:03:19,847
I mean, he's at Seijoh.

25
00:03:20,328 --> 00:03:21,016
True.

26
00:03:21,243 --> 00:03:23,895
But... this Oikawa character here...

27
00:03:24,326 --> 00:03:29,603
He seems to know his team so well that he's
able to conduct them all at 100% of their potential.

28
00:03:29,836 --> 00:03:30,716
Impressive.

29
00:03:33,188 --> 00:03:35,190
The Great King is awesome!

30
00:03:36,421 --> 00:03:37,598
I wanna play him!

31
00:03:37,623 --> 00:03:41,569
Me too! I hope to be one of those serves at me! Oh, man...

32
00:03:41,595 --> 00:03:43,016
You're cool too, Noya!

33
00:03:43,322 --> 00:03:44,688
Someone's excited.

34
00:03:44,727 --> 00:03:47,911
Hey Hinata! Look over there! The Paparazzi!

35
00:03:48,677 --> 00:03:51,600
A TV camera! Sweet, we're gonna be famous!

36
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:53,995
Hey, you two! Middle school...

37
00:03:54,789 --> 00:03:58,375
Sorry, elementary schoolers...
Please, keep it down, alright?

38
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:00,710
Sure...

39
00:04:00,807 --> 00:04:02,067
Sorry, mister...

40
00:04:31,658 --> 00:04:33,304
Wow, it's quiet for once.

41
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:34,890
Because everyone's exhausted.

42
00:04:35,657 --> 00:04:37,294
We played two games...

43
00:04:37,401 --> 00:04:40,685
But we won both in straight sets
though, so it could be a lot worse.

44
00:04:41,046 --> 00:04:45,669
If we win tomorrow, we'll be up to two full
games a day, plus the opponents will be tougher.

45
00:04:46,205 --> 00:04:48,122
We'll have to work hard to keep the energy up.

46
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,146
Right.

47
00:04:55,828 --> 00:04:58,114
Okay, meeting time, everybody.

48
00:05:01,065 --> 00:05:03,115
You kids have got to see this!

49
00:05:03,423 --> 00:05:06,650
Get your butts in here, the
volleyball club is on television!

50
00:05:06,675 --> 00:05:08,207
What?! TV?!

51
00:05:08,738 --> 00:05:10,145
Show us!

52
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:10,713
Please?

53
00:05:12,672 --> 00:05:14,142
Duuude!

54
00:05:14,167 --> 00:05:15,347
We're on TV!

55
00:05:15,535 --> 00:05:16,698
Awesome!

56
00:05:16,805 --> 00:05:18,937
You do know that's just the local news...

57
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:19,955
Quiet!

58
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,416
It's still cool, alright?!

59
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:29,370
Champion ace Wakatoshi Ushijima from Shiratorizawa Academy
in block I set his team off to a great start today...

60
00:05:29,667 --> 00:05:35,987
These reigning champs kept the momentum going from
last year by scoring 25 to 10 against the opposing

61
00:05:36,012 --> 00:05:42,040
team from Ougi South High School during the first
set, and a devastating 25 to 6 in the second set.

62
00:05:43,222 --> 00:05:45,707
Did she say "25 to 6"?

63
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,403
They won by a landslide, never once losing the lead.

64
00:05:49,428 --> 00:05:55,308
With that kind of skill, it's easy to see why
Shiratorizawa's worthy of the Inter‐High title.

65
00:05:55,891 --> 00:05:58,970
That said... Block A seems to be the group to watch.

66
00:05:59,962 --> 00:06:02,133
That's the gym we played at today!

67
00:06:02,538 --> 00:06:08,023
And the player to watch is Toru Oikawa,
the team captain from Aoba‐Johsai High.

68
00:06:08,193 --> 00:06:14,721
Not only is he talented, but his striking good looks
and personality make him popular with female fans as well.

69
00:06:14,971 --> 00:06:20,443
The next opponent, of Aoba‐Johsai made a
strong impression today... beating Date Tech

70
00:06:20,468 --> 00:06:26,348
in straight sets despite every little
indication that Date would go on to the Best 8.

71
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:27,499
Karasuno High.

72
00:06:27,524 --> 00:06:28,657
Yeah!

73
00:06:29,903 --> 00:06:31,487
What?! It's that douche?!

74
00:06:32,644 --> 00:06:36,963
We asked the captain for his thoughts
about facing Karasuno in round three tomorrow.

75
00:06:37,872 --> 00:06:44,243
Karasuno's a decent team... I hope they do
their best... so that we can annihilate them.

76
00:06:44,607 --> 00:06:50,692
I'm sure everyone watching hopes the best team
wins! Coming up next, it's time for the local weather.

77
00:06:50,717 --> 00:06:53,400
Let's go to Komata over at the Sendai Station.

78
00:06:53,462 --> 00:06:59,447
Ah! They showed your game for a second or two at the start
of the broadcast! You all looked very impressive to me!

79
00:06:59,573 --> 00:07:00,492
Listen, sir...

80
00:07:00,672 --> 00:07:02,468
We get what you're trying to do, alright...?

81
00:07:02,493 --> 00:07:03,875
Um... sorry!

82
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,530
We should probably get going guys.

83
00:07:07,702 --> 00:07:08,387
Let's go.

84
00:07:09,255 --> 00:07:10,875
I messed everything up!

85
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,937
I‐I‐It's just a meeting! Come on!

86
00:07:14,396 --> 00:07:16,545
Alright, today's game with Date Tech...

87
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:19,511
it's sort of like... your first sip of beer!

88
00:07:21,857 --> 00:07:24,058
The first sip of a beer tastes the best...

89
00:07:24,311 --> 00:07:26,439
It's great! There's nothing like it!

90
00:07:26,464 --> 00:07:27,635
Um hey Coach...

91
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:30,395
Could you put that into terms minors can understand?

92
00:07:30,437 --> 00:07:30,821
Ah...

93
00:07:33,444 --> 00:07:38,707
Well... by using the Date Tech game to
debut that freak quick we've been working' on,

94
00:07:38,865 --> 00:07:41,453
we were able to take the enemy by surprise, you know?

95
00:07:42,332 --> 00:07:47,553
But we've played against Seijoh before, so they
already know most of what's in our bag of tricks.

96
00:07:48,742 --> 00:07:49,588
That said...

97
00:07:49,942 --> 00:07:53,614
you need to remember that you guys
still have a great deal of offensive power.

98
00:07:54,978 --> 00:07:58,095
The first step is surviving that serve Oikawa does...

99
00:07:59,308 --> 00:08:01,580
We can't let it control the flow of the game.

100
00:08:02,453 --> 00:08:06,201
Because if that happens, we're
toast. So try to be careful.

101
00:08:07,681 --> 00:08:13,182
As you know, our current formation is based on
all of you except the setter going after the serves.

102
00:08:14,188 --> 00:08:19,961
But this time, I want our two middle blockers to focus
entirely on attacks and not participate in serve‐receives.

103
00:08:19,986 --> 00:08:21,157
You got that, boys?

104
00:08:21,887 --> 00:08:22,701
Yeah...

105
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:23,807
I guess...

106
00:08:23,832 --> 00:08:27,097
Hey, it's called division of
labor. Cheer up little Ginger.

107
00:08:27,642 --> 00:08:29,019
Oh, also...

108
00:08:29,377 --> 00:08:34,306
Seijoh made you think... "Whoa... They're
tough. We're screwed." That sound about right?

109
00:08:34,394 --> 00:08:35,026
Huh?

110
00:08:35,766 --> 00:08:36,576
But think.

111
00:08:37,043 --> 00:08:42,415
What if we had been watching ourselves in that game? If
we were able to see it from the spectators' perspective?

112
00:08:43,372 --> 00:08:48,760
We'd be saying' "Check out that block, it's
terrifying! No way are we gonna win!" We'd be losing it!

113
00:08:49,866 --> 00:08:54,798
But we took those guys on...
and won. And we can do it again.

114
00:09:01,181 --> 00:09:02,989
Yeah!

115
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:07,933
Alright! Let's run through the
formation while we've still got some time!

116
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:08,812
Yes, sir!

117
00:09:10,806 --> 00:09:11,719
Hey Coach.

118
00:09:12,916 --> 00:09:13,905
Oh, Mori!

119
00:09:14,572 --> 00:09:16,700
Here you go. It's today's game.

120
00:09:16,974 --> 00:09:18,182
Ah, thank you!

121
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:22,001
Next time we go drinking... it's on me.

122
00:09:22,188 --> 00:09:25,678
Aw yeah, that's what I'm talking
about! I'm holding' you to it!

123
00:09:25,705 --> 00:09:27,777
Oh, is that the Aoba‐Johsai game?

124
00:09:27,802 --> 00:09:29,623
Yeah... Sure is.

125
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:35,477
It'll be a big help, but I don't expect us to magically
overcome Oikawa's serves just by watching it today.

126
00:09:36,568 --> 00:09:39,662
But then again, though... it's better than nothing, right?

127
00:09:39,809 --> 00:09:42,860
Wow, Coach, next time your drinks are all on me!

128
00:09:42,885 --> 00:09:46,039
Sweet talker! See you tomorrow. Don't be late!

129
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:47,213
Yes, sir!

130
00:09:53,362 --> 00:09:56,824
Listen carefully. The Inter‐High
tournaments are coming up.

131
00:09:56,964 --> 00:10:03,113
My special protégé, I'm wanna crush you fair and
square at an official game where we both play the setter.

132
00:10:10,664 --> 00:10:14,730
Is it just me... or is Kageyama
more tense than he usually is?

133
00:10:15,936 --> 00:10:16,822
Here he goes.

134
00:10:16,847 --> 00:10:18,367
Stop frowning, Kageyama!

135
00:10:18,392 --> 00:10:21,972
If you don't, you're gonna get wrinkles and
you'll end up looking like a gross old grandpa!

136
00:10:21,997 --> 00:10:22,685
Huh?!

137
00:10:23,221 --> 00:10:25,709
Tomorrow... That guy's going down.

138
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:30,279
Can we... really stop Oikawa?

139
00:10:30,617 --> 00:10:34,881
Not only that, but we're gonna be on TV so
you need to practice smiling for the camera too!

140
00:10:34,906 --> 00:10:36,191
Give me a freakin' break!

141
00:10:36,216 --> 00:10:39,548
If we're gonna win this...
We're gonna have to stay focused!

142
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:43,878
Sweet!

143
00:10:49,915 --> 00:10:50,841
Goodnight, captain!

144
00:10:51,414 --> 00:10:52,720
Uh‐huh! See ya.

145
00:11:00,374 --> 00:11:00,941
Huh?

146
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:08,205
Hey... Tomorrow's a big day; So don't stay up too late.

147
00:11:09,787 --> 00:11:12,473
Oh really, now... What are you, my mother?

148
00:11:14,523 --> 00:11:19,795
Sorry, sorry, sorry! I take it back! I'll be there,
bright‐eyed and bushy‐tailed, I promise! Don't you worry!

149
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:24,977
I don't have time for this, Loserkawa. I have to
lock up the club room, so move your ass, Lazykawa!

150
00:11:25,002 --> 00:11:26,195
I don't like these names...

151
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,452
Shittykawa then!

152
00:11:27,477 --> 00:11:28,959
Now you're just being vulgar!

153
00:11:52,429 --> 00:11:54,829
Wait a sec... Could this kid be...?

154
00:12:19,932 --> 00:12:23,867
You try to get all in our space,
we'll slam that ball back in your face!

155
00:12:46,581 --> 00:12:48,939
Go‐go‐go‐go SeiJOH!

156
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:51,453
Go, go‐go‐go‐go SeiJOH!

157
00:12:51,505 --> 00:12:53,995
Go go, Sei‐Sei‐Sei‐S‐SeiJOH!

158
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:56,089
Go go, Sei‐Sei‐Sei‐S‐SeiJOH!

159
00:12:59,783 --> 00:13:01,433
May the best team win today.

160
00:13:01,715 --> 00:13:02,911
We plan to.

161
00:13:03,895 --> 00:13:06,901
Karasuno cleared the first day... Not bad!

162
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:11,206
I had to take another day off for this.
Guess I can forget vacation for a while.

163
00:13:11,231 --> 00:13:12,006
Got that right.

164
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:14,841
You know, Date Tech had a supportive crowd...

165
00:13:15,505 --> 00:13:16,532
But this...

166
00:13:17,114 --> 00:13:18,651
Ready, go!

167
00:13:18,915 --> 00:13:22,705
Go Oikawa! You're amazing!

168
00:13:23,336 --> 00:13:24,792
This is something else.

169
00:13:25,202 --> 00:13:27,657
I'm not losing to these assholes!

170
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:30,102
Yeaaaaaah!

171
00:13:31,596 --> 00:13:34,037
Coach. Looks like we've got the opening serve.

172
00:13:34,062 --> 00:13:34,671
Alright.

173
00:13:38,392 --> 00:13:39,753
Okay! Now!

174
00:13:40,093 --> 00:13:42,742
Good luck, Oikawa! We love you.

175
00:13:42,767 --> 00:13:44,348
Karasuno High...

176
00:13:44,675 --> 00:13:45,224
Fight!

177
00:13:46,478 --> 00:13:47,003
Fight!

178
00:13:48,211 --> 00:13:48,807
Fight!

179
00:13:49,737 --> 00:13:50,288
Fight!

180
00:13:52,923 --> 00:13:53,565
Now let's do some serves!

181
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:55,339
They sure are enthusiastic.

182
00:13:55,439 --> 00:13:58,999
Oh! Hey, uh, that apprentice of
yours, how are his serves coming along?

183
00:13:59,068 --> 00:14:01,104
Well, I wouldn't say "apprentice."

184
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:05,401
The jump float serve... do you
think you could teach me how to do it?

185
00:14:05,675 --> 00:14:07,042
That was only a week ago.

186
00:14:07,067 --> 00:14:07,670
Come on!

187
00:14:09,465 --> 00:14:14,601
He might just pull off a fluke... but he's
got a long way to go before he can really do it.

188
00:14:19,222 --> 00:14:22,350
Excellent work, Makki! You are sharp as ever.

189
00:14:25,813 --> 00:14:29,676
Hey, I'm sorry, Kindaichi...
That was a bit high for my taste.

190
00:14:29,701 --> 00:14:31,398
Um... okay... Right!

191
00:14:34,004 --> 00:14:39,233
Our little Iwa seems kind of tense today! Hey, you
shouldn't worry yourself too much about looking good...

192
00:14:39,258 --> 00:14:42,421
After all, the girls are too
busy watching me to notice you.

193
00:14:43,514 --> 00:14:47,922
I really gotta hand it to him, Oikawa
pays pretty close attention to his teammates.

194
00:14:48,611 --> 00:14:54,514
I can't make an informed assessment of their technique,
but I can tell that Seijoh's got strong chemistry.

195
00:14:54,908 --> 00:14:56,007
They're so in sync.

196
00:15:01,061 --> 00:15:01,853
Really?

197
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,148
Hey, let's line up guys!

198
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:01,807
For the first time, I'm playing
against him in an official game.

199
00:16:08,145 --> 00:16:09,667
Thank you for the game!

200
00:16:10,507 --> 00:16:13,860
Alright, the game's about to start! Time for round three!

201
00:16:14,205 --> 00:16:15,851
Who's gonna make the Best 8?

202
00:16:15,876 --> 00:16:17,325
It's an interesting match-up.

203
00:16:17,365 --> 00:16:20,126
Yeah, but Aoba‐Johsai's got this one in the bag.

204
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:22,310
Oh, Tobio?

205
00:16:23,822 --> 00:16:30,806
I came here looking forward to defeating a setter
who's worthy of facing me. So at least... try to keep up.

206
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:34,345
Let me tell you somethi...

207
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:35,692
We're not gonna lose!

208
00:16:35,717 --> 00:16:38,987
Hinata, you idiot! Can't you be quiet for five minutes?!

209
00:16:40,358 --> 00:16:41,358
We'll beat you.

210
00:16:43,777 --> 00:16:45,230
Just like last time!

211
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,757
Let's go, S‐S‐S‐S‐SeiJOH,

212
00:16:48,782 --> 00:16:51,105
Go, go, S‐S‐S‐S‐SeiJOH,

213
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:53,126
You can do it, S‐S‐S‐S‐SeiJOH,

214
00:16:53,151 --> 00:16:56,357
Remember, guys! You've beaten Aoba‐Johsai before.

215
00:16:56,382 --> 00:17:00,353
They may not have been at their best
last time, guys, but I still think the fact

216
00:17:00,378 --> 00:17:04,528
that we've overpowered them once already
is good enough reason to be confident.

217
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:07,975
Not to be cocky! But confident.

218
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:08,643
Sir!

219
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:11,511
Karasunooo, fight!

220
00:17:11,671 --> 00:17:13,091
Fight!

221
00:17:13,647 --> 00:17:16,182
Well then, let's do this thing, shall we?

222
00:17:16,207 --> 00:17:17,897
Just like we did yesterday.

223
00:17:20,614 --> 00:17:23,383
Don't let me down, fellows... alrighty?

224
00:17:27,688 --> 00:17:29,561
That was... intense.

225
00:17:30,394 --> 00:17:33,485
Aoba‐Johsai's mood just did a 180.

226
00:17:34,304 --> 00:17:36,416
He says that before every game.

227
00:17:37,057 --> 00:17:42,691
Coming from him, that kind of thing can sound like a joke,
but to his teammates, it's as serious as a heart attack.

228
00:17:43,512 --> 00:17:47,980
They know that he's saying exactly what
he means, and they respect him for it.

229
00:17:48,892 --> 00:17:51,577
That's why they put all their trust in him in return.

230
00:17:53,718 --> 00:17:54,676
Here we go!

231
00:17:54,988 --> 00:17:56,115
Yeah!

232
00:18:35,579 --> 00:18:36,921
Let's see it, Tsukki!

233
00:18:38,084 --> 00:18:38,598
Kunimi!

234
00:18:38,623 --> 00:18:39,173
Right!

235
00:18:39,198 --> 00:18:39,796
Good one!

236
00:18:40,522 --> 00:18:42,557
Look, two of them are getting ready to jump!

237
00:18:42,582 --> 00:18:43,690
Interesting...

238
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:44,607
I'm open!

239
00:18:45,601 --> 00:18:48,922
It's been a while since I saw
him set a ball up from this close.

240
00:19:01,436 --> 00:19:03,462
A setter dump, right off the bat?!

241
00:19:07,242 --> 00:19:12,313
Work it Owikawa, Work it Owikawa! Get thaaat Point!

242
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:14,243
Really?!

243
00:19:14,383 --> 00:19:15,410
A setter dump...?

244
00:19:15,745 --> 00:19:18,091
That's when the setter makes an attack, right?

245
00:19:18,473 --> 00:19:21,327
I'll give you a little hint; I'm about to do that again...

246
00:19:21,352 --> 00:19:24,015
Pay attention this time and
maybe you'll be able to stop me.

247
00:19:27,013 --> 00:19:32,595
Hey... is he really serious about doing another
setter dump? People never do those moves twice in a row.

248
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:35,651
Making you think that is exactly
how they trick you into screwing up.

249
00:19:35,676 --> 00:19:38,600
Aah, so that's it! You're really smart, Tanaka!

250
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:41,968
Alright cut it out, there's no
sense in psychoanalyzing it...

251
00:19:41,993 --> 00:19:46,848
That's just like trying to predict what somebody's next
move is going to be in a game of rock‐paper‐scissors.

252
00:19:48,264 --> 00:19:49,608
Don't think too hard.

253
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:50,412
Okay!

254
00:19:51,196 --> 00:19:52,654
Matsukawa's serve!

255
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:54,562
Stay focused!

256
00:19:54,587 --> 00:19:55,700
Nice one, Cap!

257
00:19:55,935 --> 00:19:57,013
B!

258
00:19:57,038 --> 00:19:58,586
Bring it this way!

259
00:19:58,699 --> 00:20:00,192
Hey, it's Number 10!

260
00:20:00,373 --> 00:20:01,396
He's gonna do it!

261
00:20:04,295 --> 00:20:05,712
It's that quick attack!

262
00:20:06,817 --> 00:20:08,816
Crap... this one's head‐on!

263
00:20:09,034 --> 00:20:11,122
Hey! Check out the Seijoh setter!

264
00:20:11,582 --> 00:20:15,319
It's gonna be another dump...
but way more obvious, this time!

265
00:20:16,331 --> 00:20:17,592
Nice try!

266
00:20:22,402 --> 00:20:26,064
He just changed from a spike... to a set!

267
00:20:30,415 --> 00:20:32,307
Hey... that was too low.

268
00:20:32,484 --> 00:20:34,126
Oh yeah? My bad...

269
00:20:34,151 --> 00:20:37,756
But well, you know, Iwa... you do
always seem to hit them either way.

270
00:20:37,936 --> 00:20:39,027
Did you see that?!

271
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:41,561
They're so good, it kinda pisses me off!

272
00:20:41,873 --> 00:20:43,897
Oh, Oikawaaaa!

273
00:20:44,203 --> 00:20:46,183
He's so incredible!

274
00:20:47,085 --> 00:20:50,783
They're a lot tougher than I thought...
What the hell are they feeding these kids?

275
00:20:50,808 --> 00:20:55,509
Well... it may be true... that we won
a practice game against Aoba‐Johsai...

276
00:20:55,835 --> 00:21:01,374
but like you said, now that they've got their
official conductor... the tune is different.

277
00:21:03,062 --> 00:21:03,686
Crap.

278
00:21:03,711 --> 00:21:05,190
Relax, you two.

279
00:21:06,004 --> 00:21:11,672
Listen, we already knew Oikawa was good, remember?
Our setter and our attacks are impressive too...

280
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:13,417
We can win this.

281
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:15,076
Right!

282
00:21:16,842 --> 00:21:18,731
Give us another one, Matsukawa!

283
00:21:20,013 --> 00:21:21,114
Nishinoya!

284
00:21:21,139 --> 00:21:21,888
Gotcha!

285
00:21:22,181 --> 00:21:24,507
Okay! Bring it to me!

286
00:21:30,123 --> 00:21:31,330
Number 5!

287
00:21:33,491 --> 00:21:35,399
Ooh! They faked him out!

288
00:21:42,298 --> 00:21:43,032
A pipe?!

289
00:22:05,812 --> 00:22:08,341
He did a setter dump too!

290
00:22:09,034 --> 00:22:11,086
That guy must really hate losing.

291
00:22:11,191 --> 00:22:12,540
That was pretty amazing!

292
00:22:15,515 --> 00:22:16,258
Oikawa.

293
00:22:17,928 --> 00:22:21,773
That's our next play too... So
I suggest that you pay attention.

294
00:22:22,782 --> 00:22:23,678
That so?

295
00:22:25,358 --> 00:22:26,633
You little prick...

296
00:23:58,556 --> 00:24:01,131
Tobio's Kageyama's an insufferable brat.

297
00:24:01,156 --> 00:24:03,667
Look who's talking; You were the
first one to do a setter dump...

298
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,979
Luckily I have you guys! Group hug!

299
00:24:06,604 --> 00:24:08,786
Yeah, you're way more annoying than he is.

300
00:24:08,811 --> 00:24:12,326
Next Haikyu!! "Toru Oikawa is No Genius."
