1
00:00:08,205 --> 00:00:10,054
Oooh!

2
00:00:10,703 --> 00:00:11,691
We have a banner?

3
00:00:13,917 --> 00:00:14,987
You can do it.

4
00:00:23,714 --> 00:00:25,904
What the hell?! Calm down already!

5
00:00:26,913 --> 00:00:27,994
We can win!

6
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:29,877
The first round is all ours!

7
00:00:29,902 --> 00:00:31,609
Yeah!

8
00:00:52,855 --> 00:00:53,410
Huh?

9
00:00:55,596 --> 00:00:56,469
Hey.

10
00:01:08,465 --> 00:01:10,897
So... looks like it's time for-

11
00:01:10,922 --> 00:01:12,334
Uh, don't say it.

12
00:01:12,412 --> 00:01:12,736
Uh?

13
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:16,124
You were about to start talking about
something really sappy, weren't you?

14
00:01:16,149 --> 00:01:18,912
Yeah, something about this being our last tournament...

15
00:01:19,718 --> 00:01:21,167
Who wants to hear that crap?

16
00:01:21,192 --> 00:01:22,005
Ah? Eh...

17
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:26,032
I guess this shall truly be our last tournament.

18
00:01:26,492 --> 00:01:27,095
Yeah.

19
00:01:28,297 --> 00:01:29,512
It's so crazy...

20
00:01:29,852 --> 00:01:31,728
We've all been through so much together.

21
00:01:31,856 --> 00:01:32,593
Uh...

22
00:01:33,516 --> 00:01:37,033
That kind of talk makes me feel like
we're planning for it to be over. Stop it!

23
00:01:37,058 --> 00:01:39,282
Aw come on, what's so bad about it?!

24
00:01:39,346 --> 00:01:42,492
I had this whole big plan to
boost you guys' morale yesterday,

25
00:01:42,517 --> 00:01:47,038
by getting all of the third-year players together
after practice for a quiet talk under the stars,

26
00:01:47,063 --> 00:01:48,332
so we could get ready...

27
00:01:48,396 --> 00:01:50,604
But then you guys just up and left!

28
00:01:50,629 --> 00:01:54,131
That surprise from Kiyoko more
than doubled the team's morale though.

29
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:58,405
Well... Yeah... I guess that's true, but...

30
00:01:59,528 --> 00:02:03,712
All we need to worry about today is winning
the first two rounds so we can make it to day two.

31
00:02:04,191 --> 00:02:06,224
I don't want to talk like the year is finished.

32
00:02:06,878 --> 00:02:09,300
Let's just play the game... and win it!

33
00:02:09,697 --> 00:02:11,198
Don't sweat the other stuff.

34
00:02:12,168 --> 00:02:12,819
Yeah.

35
00:02:13,448 --> 00:02:15,779
We're counting on you, ace... Just... play hard.

36
00:02:15,804 --> 00:02:16,552
Morning!

37
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:19,872
Daichi being nice is freaking me out.

38
00:02:19,897 --> 00:02:21,521
Yeah, it doesn't suit him does it.

39
00:02:21,838 --> 00:02:24,410
Oh I'm sorry, I can be mean if that works better.

40
00:02:25,699 --> 00:02:26,404
Good morning!

41
00:02:26,429 --> 00:02:26,761
Morning!

42
00:02:26,786 --> 00:02:27,302
Ah?

43
00:02:27,643 --> 00:02:29,424
Hey! Awhhhhh...

44
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:31,973
Good morning! We'll unlock the room for ya.

45
00:02:33,356 --> 00:02:34,253
Time to go.

46
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:34,913
Yep!

47
00:04:11,697 --> 00:04:13,332
What do you think Karasuno's like?

48
00:04:14,035 --> 00:04:16,046
Hopefully... they're not a bunch of giants.

49
00:04:16,437 --> 00:04:20,423
Eh, don't worry about it, man. I
heard they haven't been too hot recently.

50
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:22,398
Shiratorizawa's gonna clean house.

51
00:04:22,422 --> 00:04:22,901
Hum?

52
00:04:23,045 --> 00:04:25,856
Um nah, Aoba Johsai's a bigger threat this year.

53
00:04:26,002 --> 00:04:29,456
Now that Oikawa's a third-year, they're
even tougher than they were before.

54
00:04:29,552 --> 00:04:32,404
Plus, their first-years are improving really fast.

55
00:04:32,459 --> 00:04:33,994
But, that's Seijoh for ya.

56
00:04:34,135 --> 00:04:35,806
Eh... I dunno...

57
00:04:36,012 --> 00:04:38,317
Y'think they can win the block against Date Tech?

58
00:04:38,712 --> 00:04:41,065
All I know, is I'm glad they're not in block a.

59
00:04:41,203 --> 00:04:44,122
Let's see... Who is in block a?

60
00:04:45,408 --> 00:04:46,641
What does the Kanji say?

61
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:47,965
Karasuno?

62
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:49,866
Oh, yeah! They might have a shot.

63
00:04:50,128 --> 00:04:51,336
Aren't they supposed to be tough?

64
00:04:51,361 --> 00:04:55,769
Yeah, a few years ago, maybe... Now they
suck so bad they've even got a lame nickname.

65
00:04:55,794 --> 00:04:56,918
Huh, oh really?

66
00:04:56,942 --> 00:04:58,471
So, then, what are they called?

67
00:04:58,496 --> 00:05:01,116
Uh, something about how they're fallen champions.

68
00:05:01,609 --> 00:05:03,839
Oh! "The wingless crows."

69
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:07,845
Ah!

70
00:05:08,553 --> 00:05:10,453
Eh, maybe you should keep it down.

71
00:05:10,605 --> 00:05:13,765
What did you just say?! "Wingless crows"? Well-

72
00:05:14,018 --> 00:05:15,273
Cut it out, now...

73
00:05:15,688 --> 00:05:16,514
I'm really sorry.

74
00:05:16,684 --> 00:05:17,935
Uh, it's cool.

75
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,549
Do I need to get you a leash?

76
00:05:19,574 --> 00:05:20,223
No...

77
00:05:21,181 --> 00:05:21,810
Uh er...

78
00:05:27,598 --> 00:05:28,932
They're kinda scary.

79
00:05:29,012 --> 00:05:30,663
That guy looks like a grown man.

80
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,549
Wait! Is that who I think it is?!

81
00:05:34,068 --> 00:05:35,812
Yeah, that's Asahi!

82
00:05:37,237 --> 00:05:38,718
Wait... What? Who's that?

83
00:05:38,743 --> 00:05:40,259
You mean you really don't know?!

84
00:05:40,481 --> 00:05:43,024
He made his goons beat up some guys from North High.

85
00:05:43,338 --> 00:05:45,139
Let's teach these fools a lesson.

86
00:05:45,195 --> 00:05:47,292
Oh no, a fight! Stay here!

87
00:05:47,317 --> 00:05:48,991
I'll go call the authorities!

88
00:05:49,452 --> 00:05:51,963
Then he got caught selling stuff on the street.

89
00:05:52,174 --> 00:05:53,576
Fifty thousand.

90
00:05:54,128 --> 00:05:56,007
Miss, did you drop your handkerchief?

91
00:05:56,194 --> 00:05:57,207
I'm so sorry!

92
00:05:57,864 --> 00:05:59,941
He got held back five years.

93
00:05:59,966 --> 00:06:01,798
Dude, he's old!

94
00:06:01,823 --> 00:06:03,943
Oh boy, here we go again, Daichi.

95
00:06:04,395 --> 00:06:06,264
It's hard to avoid that with your looks.

96
00:06:06,289 --> 00:06:08,592
Wh-what's the matter with the way I look?!

97
00:06:08,836 --> 00:06:12,365
I'm a taller guy, so what's wrong with
me wanting to look all tough and wild?!

98
00:06:12,462 --> 00:06:16,632
Okay, yeah, you see... Nobody who's
tough or wild would ever say that, dude.

99
00:06:19,491 --> 00:06:22,504
What's the big deal, dude? Who cares how you look?

100
00:06:22,948 --> 00:06:24,939
See, this is what wild looks like.

101
00:06:24,963 --> 00:06:25,466
Um?

102
00:06:26,738 --> 00:06:27,850
Hey, check that out.

103
00:06:28,545 --> 00:06:30,751
I guess the banner really did the trick.

104
00:06:30,847 --> 00:06:32,015
Do you really think so?

105
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,848
I mean, it did a lot more good than anything I said.

106
00:06:34,934 --> 00:06:36,011
She is smokin'...

107
00:06:36,052 --> 00:06:37,502
Hey, I dare you to talk to her.

108
00:06:37,527 --> 00:06:39,332
Oh man, you think she could handle it.

109
00:06:44,342 --> 00:06:45,354
Cut that out.

110
00:06:45,609 --> 00:06:47,920
She just hit me... That was awesome...

111
00:06:48,442 --> 00:06:50,271
Hey, see that short guy over there?

112
00:06:50,569 --> 00:06:52,679
I think that's Nishinoya from Chidoriyama.

113
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:54,792
He won "best libero" back in middle school.

114
00:06:55,662 --> 00:06:56,937
Whoa... really?

115
00:06:57,191 --> 00:06:59,187
And that's not all. Y'see that guy there?

116
00:06:59,212 --> 00:07:02,124
He's that scary-looking setter dude
that everyone's been talking about.

117
00:07:02,831 --> 00:07:05,483
The king of the court from Kitagawa First!

118
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:10,824
But why Karasuno?

119
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:11,842
Beats me...

120
00:07:12,085 --> 00:07:15,607
I heard he got a bad rep in middle
school though, so maybe that's why.

121
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:17,881
Okay, then who's the carrot top?

122
00:07:18,296 --> 00:07:19,962
Is he some kind of living legend too?

123
00:07:20,713 --> 00:07:22,029
Whoa!

124
00:07:23,884 --> 00:07:26,017
Um... I don't think so...

125
00:07:27,099 --> 00:07:27,812
He's weird.

126
00:07:28,132 --> 00:07:30,521
Wow, there's so many people!

127
00:07:32,174 --> 00:07:33,445
Hey, the summit!

128
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,717
That's exactly where I'm headed! Stay outta my way!

129
00:07:37,697 --> 00:07:41,984
What's with you?! You can't say things
like that! I'm so sorry, he's a little off!

130
00:07:42,196 --> 00:07:42,762
Okay...

131
00:07:42,786 --> 00:07:43,273
Ah!

132
00:07:44,581 --> 00:07:46,427
This place is huge!

133
00:07:49,158 --> 00:07:51,043
It smells like air salonpas!

134
00:07:51,734 --> 00:07:53,354
What are you talking about?

135
00:07:53,419 --> 00:07:55,910
That is what makes a tournament
smell like a real tournament!

136
00:07:55,935 --> 00:07:57,101
I know, right?!

137
00:07:57,204 --> 00:07:57,748
Mm-hm...

138
00:07:57,788 --> 00:07:58,355
They're here!

139
00:07:58,379 --> 00:07:59,698
Whoa, they're tall!

140
00:07:59,734 --> 00:08:00,448
Hm?

141
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:07,647
It's Date Tech!

142
00:08:09,682 --> 00:08:11,264
Where are his eyebrows?!

143
00:08:18,864 --> 00:08:20,396
Who the hell are y-, hum!

144
00:08:27,817 --> 00:08:30,362
Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, dude!

145
00:08:30,724 --> 00:08:31,895
Please don't do that!

146
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,356
I am so sorry about him, everybody!

147
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:36,487
Um, can I get a little help here!

148
00:08:36,512 --> 00:08:39,356
Yeah, yeah, please excuse our giant friend here.

149
00:08:39,381 --> 00:08:42,659
He has a way of automatically picking
out the ace on every team he sees.

150
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:44,708
Anyway...

151
00:08:45,404 --> 00:08:48,441
Hope you're ready... 'Cause
you're about to lose miserably.

152
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,979
Why do you guys always have to be so rude?

153
00:08:51,004 --> 00:08:53,015
That's not good sportsmanship at all!

154
00:08:53,804 --> 00:08:54,857
Well that was something...

155
00:08:55,112 --> 00:08:56,880
I wasn't really sure how to respond.

156
00:08:56,905 --> 00:08:57,638
Yeah.

157
00:08:57,957 --> 00:09:00,194
I'm impressed you were able to look him in the eye-

158
00:09:00,296 --> 00:09:00,791
Ah!

159
00:09:01,579 --> 00:09:03,845
Oh man... that was really scary.

160
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:06,836
How are you a badass on the
court but a wimp everywhere else?

161
00:09:06,861 --> 00:09:08,815
Damn Noya, that was cold!

162
00:09:09,339 --> 00:09:10,186
Sawamura.

163
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:10,657
Huh?

164
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,112
Been a while.

165
00:09:12,196 --> 00:09:15,869
Oh, Ikejiri! Hey, uh... I'll catch you guys later!

166
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,103
Okay, see ya!

167
00:09:18,977 --> 00:09:20,130
Long time, no see.

168
00:09:20,743 --> 00:09:23,591
Yeah... you look bigger now.

169
00:09:23,822 --> 00:09:26,086
Really? I'm the same height as before.

170
00:09:26,572 --> 00:09:27,898
Uh, that's not what I meant.

171
00:09:27,923 --> 00:09:29,279
So I'm fatter?!

172
00:09:29,304 --> 00:09:30,424
No, not that.

173
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:35,486
His build is different, and he looks more intense.

174
00:09:36,046 --> 00:09:37,758
I'm sure he's training harder too.

175
00:09:39,604 --> 00:09:41,516
I saw you at the entrance a while ago...

176
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:44,367
But I guess I was too intimidated to say something to you.

177
00:09:44,427 --> 00:09:46,045
Wait what, are you serious?

178
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,911
Well no, I understand. I guess some of our
guys don't look very approachable, do they?

179
00:09:50,101 --> 00:09:54,194
Well it's just... they all seem
really tough... and so do you.

180
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:55,561
You think so?

181
00:09:55,776 --> 00:09:59,137
The thing is, my school has kind of a small-time team.

182
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:03,086
Uh!

183
00:10:03,111 --> 00:10:03,549
Listen uh-

184
00:10:03,574 --> 00:10:04,747
Wait, forget I said that!

185
00:10:05,803 --> 00:10:07,749
Look, it doesn't matter how big we are...

186
00:10:07,915 --> 00:10:09,538
Or how big we used to be...

187
00:10:09,895 --> 00:10:11,294
'Cause we're here now, so...

188
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:13,450
Fact is, we're gonna wipe the floor with you!

189
00:10:13,533 --> 00:10:13,998
Ah uh...

190
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:21,351
I'm so nervous!

191
00:10:21,403 --> 00:10:22,641
I know. Me too.

192
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:26,528
Was it just me, or were their spikes
really on point during practice before?

193
00:10:26,608 --> 00:10:28,751
Yeah they did make the top 8 last year...

194
00:10:28,776 --> 00:10:31,111
Well, maybe hopefully we won't get matched with them!

195
00:10:31,771 --> 00:10:34,225
We should have showed up to morning practice more.

196
00:10:37,096 --> 00:10:44,607
Remember... it doesn't matter how strong or
talented your opponent is. You won't win unless you try.

197
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:48,525
If you look back now... We had more than enough time.

198
00:10:49,661 --> 00:10:51,974
We could have practiced a lot more than we did.

199
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:54,096
We didn't have our priorities straight.

200
00:10:54,575 --> 00:10:56,328
Yeah well it's too late for that, Yui-

201
00:10:56,353 --> 00:10:58,123
But none of that matters any more!

202
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,744
We've got 45 minutes 'til the starting whistle blows.

203
00:11:02,144 --> 00:11:07,806
All we can do now is make sure we're properly warmed up,
then play to the best of our ability 'til the very end!

204
00:11:08,406 --> 00:11:11,628
And maybe... we can win!

205
00:11:14,157 --> 00:11:16,722
Gather 'round, everyone... Let's huddle!

206
00:11:20,117 --> 00:11:21,435
You heard the captain, ladies!

207
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:22,284
What?

208
00:11:24,732 --> 00:11:26,923
Karasunoooo... fight!

209
00:11:26,948 --> 00:11:28,148
Yeah!

210
00:11:34,475 --> 00:11:37,490
Hinata... you better not be about to puke again.

211
00:11:37,937 --> 00:11:39,283
No! I-I'm mediating!

212
00:11:39,308 --> 00:11:41,002
What is that supposed to mean?!

213
00:11:41,154 --> 00:11:42,939
Um, I think he means "meditating".

214
00:11:42,964 --> 00:11:45,562
Nah... looks like he might pee himself.

215
00:11:45,602 --> 00:11:47,993
You must be freaked out over what happened with Date Tech.

216
00:11:48,018 --> 00:11:50,899
I-I no-I'm not freaked out, I'm just finding my chi.

217
00:11:50,924 --> 00:11:51,982
Your chi?!

218
00:11:52,255 --> 00:11:53,722
Oh great...

219
00:11:54,007 --> 00:11:55,034
He's losing it...

220
00:11:55,189 --> 00:11:57,178
We're gonna have to do something fast.

221
00:11:58,402 --> 00:12:01,507
Or else it'll be the Seijoh game all over again.

222
00:12:03,147 --> 00:12:07,110
Wow, Asahi, you're just as much of a
coward, but you don't seem to be that nervous.

223
00:12:07,135 --> 00:12:08,761
He just called me a coward?

224
00:12:09,049 --> 00:12:11,773
Well I have a trick for getting rid of pre-game jitters.

225
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:15,284
Just think about something totally
awful that happened in your past...

226
00:12:15,309 --> 00:12:16,850
The more terrifying the better.

227
00:12:17,084 --> 00:12:21,091
And then you think, "this isn't the
worst thing there is, I can handle it."

228
00:12:21,856 --> 00:12:24,248
Something in my past that was really scary.

229
00:12:25,606 --> 00:12:29,266
Hmm... hmm... hmm...

230
00:12:36,211 --> 00:12:37,204
Hm? Hinata?

231
00:12:37,368 --> 00:12:39,588
Yup... I think I'll be okay.

232
00:12:39,677 --> 00:12:41,431
Snap out of it, we need you!

233
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:46,635
If you had this amazing coping strategy, then why did you
get all bent out of shape last time we played Date Tech?

234
00:12:47,702 --> 00:12:51,355
Listen Noya, that's the kind of thing you
think but don't actually say, understand?

235
00:12:51,387 --> 00:12:55,682
Uh, well I really didn't have time to think of
anything scary that day. I couldn't concentrate,

236
00:12:55,707 --> 00:12:59,514
and it takes a lot of effort to come up
with the mental image! You guys get that, right?

237
00:12:59,539 --> 00:13:00,773
Lame excuse.

238
00:13:01,606 --> 00:13:02,585
Everybody ready?

239
00:13:03,953 --> 00:13:06,422
This is our first game... Now, let's go get warmed up.

240
00:13:06,641 --> 00:13:07,384
Right!

241
00:13:08,463 --> 00:13:10,098
It's finally happening!

242
00:13:42,578 --> 00:13:44,096
Whoaaaaa!

243
00:13:45,031 --> 00:13:47,347
This place... it's huge!

244
00:13:47,372 --> 00:13:49,753
Could you pick your jaw up off the floor, please?

245
00:13:50,197 --> 00:13:51,326
You're too serious!

246
00:13:51,351 --> 00:13:53,147
At least I'm not having a freak-out!

247
00:13:53,172 --> 00:13:55,275
H-hey, let me go, Kageyama!

248
00:14:06,438 --> 00:14:09,696
Ready, boys? 'Bout time to get in a few practice reps!

249
00:14:09,729 --> 00:14:10,815
Yes, sir!

250
00:14:14,457 --> 00:14:16,447
Let's go get a closer look at 'em.

251
00:14:16,504 --> 00:14:20,402
I want to see those two Karasuno
first-years do that quick attack of theirs.

252
00:14:20,427 --> 00:14:20,936
Yeah.

253
00:14:25,304 --> 00:14:26,840
Aoba Johsai's here.

254
00:14:26,922 --> 00:14:28,229
Man, those guys are tall...

255
00:14:28,531 --> 00:14:30,216
They look like they're pretty tough, too.

256
00:14:30,426 --> 00:14:35,578
Well it depends. A big part of how good a
team is, is their setter... Wait, where is he?

257
00:14:38,021 --> 00:14:39,383
Where'd Oikawa go?

258
00:14:40,206 --> 00:14:41,926
Uhhh... He's uh...

259
00:14:41,951 --> 00:14:43,922
Tell us. We don't have all day!

260
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:47,104
He got held up by some girls from other schools...

261
00:14:49,721 --> 00:14:50,739
Iwaizumi.

262
00:14:50,847 --> 00:14:51,542
Got it.

263
00:14:54,428 --> 00:14:57,016
These are amazing! You really made them yourself?

264
00:14:57,041 --> 00:14:59,686
Yeah, I stayed up really late last night baking!

265
00:14:59,711 --> 00:15:02,205
Well that makes me feel really special. Thank you.

266
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:03,901
Ah! I-it was nothing!

267
00:15:04,002 --> 00:15:06,658
Could I please take a quick photo with you, Oikawa?

268
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:09,718
You want a picture of me? Absolutely-ahhh!

269
00:15:13,339 --> 00:15:16,972
Unbelievable! Not even the coach has ever hit me!

270
00:15:22,177 --> 00:15:24,886
Sorry ladies, have to take a rain check on that photo.

271
00:15:24,911 --> 00:15:26,434
Aww...

272
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:32,448
It's onion head!

273
00:15:33,243 --> 00:15:34,847
What the hell's an onion head?

274
00:15:35,093 --> 00:15:36,923
You're the only one it could be.

275
00:15:36,948 --> 00:15:37,590
Huh?!

276
00:15:37,615 --> 00:15:38,308
Yoo-hoo!

277
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:38,827
Ah.

278
00:15:40,444 --> 00:15:44,603
Kageyama and small fry! How's that
cute little combo move comin' along?

279
00:15:44,723 --> 00:15:45,684
Great king!

280
00:15:46,693 --> 00:15:48,504
Would you please stop doing that?

281
00:15:49,842 --> 00:15:53,700
So you got a libero. He wasn't
with you at the practice game.

282
00:15:55,155 --> 00:15:56,933
I think that big guy's new, too.

283
00:15:57,686 --> 00:15:58,430
Hey...

284
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:02,013
That coach... I don't think
I've ever seen him around before.

285
00:16:03,445 --> 00:16:05,331
Ginger, move your ass!

286
00:16:05,359 --> 00:16:05,710
Okay!

287
00:16:05,735 --> 00:16:08,660
So they have new players and a new coach to boot...

288
00:16:09,257 --> 00:16:12,061
Wonder if that means Karasuno's improved their game, any.

289
00:16:13,829 --> 00:16:15,096
Well, today's the day.

290
00:16:15,842 --> 00:16:17,179
I can't believe it...

291
00:16:17,259 --> 00:16:20,443
Our team's about to play here... In this giant venue.

292
00:16:20,835 --> 00:16:24,280
It's making me... nervous just
watching from the sidelines.

293
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:25,631
But that's why...

294
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:30,819
It's important to do everything
we can, to the best of our ability.

295
00:16:31,055 --> 00:16:31,655
Yes.

296
00:16:32,818 --> 00:16:33,926
And... go!

297
00:16:35,807 --> 00:16:36,628
I'm ready!

298
00:16:36,861 --> 00:16:38,193
Date Tech...

299
00:16:39,254 --> 00:16:39,795
Asahi!

300
00:16:39,819 --> 00:16:40,227
Hm!

301
00:16:40,827 --> 00:16:41,405
Right here!

302
00:16:41,438 --> 00:16:43,421
Listen I'm worried about Date Tech too...

303
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:45,292
But I won't be defeated...

304
00:16:45,396 --> 00:16:48,199
Because my mind's on victory... and remember...

305
00:16:48,271 --> 00:16:48,927
Got it!

306
00:16:49,931 --> 00:16:53,104
We have to remain focused on the opponents in front of us.

307
00:16:53,383 --> 00:16:54,003
Yeah.

308
00:16:56,162 --> 00:16:57,196
Captains!

309
00:17:00,907 --> 00:17:01,352
Thank you for the game.

310
00:17:01,377 --> 00:17:02,408
Thank you for the game.

311
00:17:11,873 --> 00:17:12,991
Alright, you guys!

312
00:17:13,595 --> 00:17:14,221
Line up!

313
00:17:57,504 --> 00:17:59,031
Thank you for the game!

314
00:18:04,896 --> 00:18:08,095
Go, go, Date Tech, Date Tech, here we go!

315
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:11,527
Go, go, Date Tech, Date Tech, here we go!

316
00:18:11,552 --> 00:18:14,912
Go, go, Date Tech, Date Tech, here we go!

317
00:18:15,023 --> 00:18:16,780
It's the first game of the season.

318
00:18:16,955 --> 00:18:20,552
And that kinda pressure can make anybody
nervous enough to throw off their game.

319
00:18:20,639 --> 00:18:23,606
So our job is to shake the
nerves off quicker than they do.

320
00:18:23,699 --> 00:18:26,538
The best way to get in the
groove is to score the first point!

321
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:27,317
Sir!

322
00:18:27,592 --> 00:18:30,704
I don't say this to flatter you guys. I really mean it.

323
00:18:30,995 --> 00:18:33,096
You are all very talented.

324
00:18:33,183 --> 00:18:34,691
We've got a great team!

325
00:18:34,937 --> 00:18:38,983
Let's show this whole stadium...
These crows can still fly!

326
00:18:39,008 --> 00:18:41,804
Whoa! Take's making a big speech!

327
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:44,567
I bet those jerks still call us by that dumb nickname...

328
00:18:44,717 --> 00:18:46,675
Man, they don't know how wrong they are.

329
00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:49,653
People call them "the wingless crows".

330
00:18:50,339 --> 00:18:52,125
It's time to stand up and say...

331
00:18:52,213 --> 00:18:55,365
That's not true anymore! The old warhorse is back!

332
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:56,423
Yes, sir!

333
00:18:57,433 --> 00:19:00,150
Ah... Wait! Was that too cheesy?! I'll stop!

334
00:19:00,175 --> 00:19:01,896
No, no, no! That was great!

335
00:19:01,998 --> 00:19:03,675
Hey, what's an old warhorse?

336
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,726
I never understand what he says.

337
00:19:05,822 --> 00:19:10,113
I think what Takeda was trying to say was
that we were known for being stronger in the past.

338
00:19:10,144 --> 00:19:11,769
Can we just worry about today?!

339
00:19:12,278 --> 00:19:14,886
Karasunooo, fight!

340
00:19:14,919 --> 00:19:15,902
Fight!

341
00:19:17,796 --> 00:19:19,915
Just get that first point, boys.

342
00:19:20,357 --> 00:19:23,663
Don't lose your head... All
that practice is going to pay off.

343
00:19:23,688 --> 00:19:25,574
And don't forget to watch those receives.

344
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:26,525
Yes, sir!

345
00:19:27,605 --> 00:19:30,941
No way! That little number 10 is their middle-blocker?!

346
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:34,280
I bet he can't be any taller than 5 foot 5.

347
00:19:34,305 --> 00:19:36,640
Why do they have those taller guys on the bench?

348
00:19:36,836 --> 00:19:41,524
Hilarious... those guys look totally
confused... And well, I guess they should be.

349
00:19:41,718 --> 00:19:44,726
The middle blocker position is usually all about height.

350
00:19:45,376 --> 00:19:47,983
Is that short guy part of their starting lineup?

351
00:19:48,173 --> 00:19:49,747
He's not a libero...

352
00:19:49,787 --> 00:19:52,034
Laugh now, but you'll pay the price later.

353
00:19:53,034 --> 00:19:54,486
Well, you would know, wouldn'tcha?

354
00:19:54,511 --> 00:19:57,194
I am not letting him make a fool of me next time.

355
00:19:59,609 --> 00:20:00,982
Here we go!

356
00:20:01,699 --> 00:20:02,969
Your serve, Komaki!

357
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:04,646
Asahi!

358
00:20:04,671 --> 00:20:05,487
Got it!

359
00:20:06,232 --> 00:20:08,100
First shot... Where do I send it?

360
00:20:08,266 --> 00:20:10,809
Who can intimidate the other team and boost our morale?

361
00:20:11,142 --> 00:20:13,249
What is the best move to start the game?!

362
00:20:13,489 --> 00:20:15,370
I know... perfect!

363
00:20:15,395 --> 00:20:17,841
Awww yeahhhh!

364
00:20:23,042 --> 00:20:23,925
Nice one-

365
00:20:26,106 --> 00:20:27,477
Okay, you can stop now-

366
00:20:28,421 --> 00:20:30,719
Shut up! Now!

367
00:20:32,518 --> 00:20:34,723
Karasuno already got themselves a warning!

368
00:20:34,748 --> 00:20:36,958
Wow, these guys are a freakin' joke.

369
00:20:36,983 --> 00:20:40,174
Hey, don't sweat it! Switch gears and pay these guys back!

370
00:20:40,199 --> 00:20:41,962
Yeah, take back that point!

371
00:20:42,997 --> 00:20:44,416
Take it to 'em, Tanaka!

372
00:20:44,441 --> 00:20:46,409
Pshhh, good luck, cue-ball!

373
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:47,755
Here!

374
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:48,733
Nice receive!

375
00:20:48,806 --> 00:20:49,647
Ikejiri!

376
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,460
How did he even get to that ball?!

377
00:20:56,485 --> 00:20:58,704
That libero's got reflexes!

378
00:20:58,729 --> 00:21:00,721
Damn, it's too far from the setter!

379
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,168
Here, Asahi!

380
00:21:02,395 --> 00:21:04,361
Alright, here comes the left! Triple up!

381
00:21:04,393 --> 00:21:05,839
It's up to you, ace!

382
00:21:12,306 --> 00:21:14,427
Damn, that's a grown-ass man!

383
00:21:14,452 --> 00:21:16,616
I hear he's been held back 5 times!

384
00:21:16,641 --> 00:21:17,901
He's gotta be at least 30!

385
00:21:17,926 --> 00:21:18,862
That's crazy.

386
00:21:20,309 --> 00:21:22,354
Try not to let it get to you, Asahi!

387
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:23,518
No way...

388
00:21:24,292 --> 00:21:25,902
Did you see that momentum?

389
00:21:26,063 --> 00:21:26,770
Uh-huh.

390
00:21:26,795 --> 00:21:29,302
That's right, don't mess with our left side!

391
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,592
Oh, and... that's not the only
weapon we've got up our sleeves.

392
00:21:38,162 --> 00:21:40,304
Don't you dare wimp out on me!

393
00:21:40,988 --> 00:21:42,694
Same thing again, Tanaka!

394
00:21:43,612 --> 00:21:44,465
I'm open!

395
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:49,272
You're all very talented... We've got a great team!

396
00:21:54,892 --> 00:21:56,688
Let's show this whole stadium...

397
00:21:57,431 --> 00:21:59,632
These crows can still fly!

398
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:16,830
He's flying.

399
00:22:29,808 --> 00:22:30,630
Alright...

400
00:22:31,891 --> 00:22:33,440
Prepare yourselves...

401
00:22:39,345 --> 00:22:41,591
for the Karasuno warhorse!

402
00:24:14,204 --> 00:24:15,946
It's finally time, guys!

403
00:24:15,971 --> 00:24:17,940
Listen carefully, young one...

404
00:24:18,433 --> 00:24:20,276
In Sendai, Miyagi prefecture...

405
00:24:20,301 --> 00:24:22,990
When someone says "the old warhorse"...

406
00:24:23,015 --> 00:24:24,959
They mean Karasuno!

407
00:24:25,129 --> 00:24:27,428
Next Haikyu!! "Winner and loser."
