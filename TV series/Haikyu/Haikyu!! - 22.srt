1
00:00:23,438 --> 00:00:25,722
K-Kageyama! What are you plotting?!

2
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:27,255
Must be something evil!

3
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,305
What's your problem?!

4
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:29,805
Yeah, he's not plotting anything!

5
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:32,213
I think this is just the first
time he's ever tried to smile!

6
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:34,202
You didn't mean that the way it sounded, right?

7
00:00:34,227 --> 00:00:35,912
Oh, screw you, Hinata!

8
00:00:37,697 --> 00:00:41,004
Our little grump is finally showing his feelings!

9
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:43,050
Time to change it up...

10
00:00:43,284 --> 00:00:44,800
Do you remember the hand signals?

11
00:00:45,192 --> 00:00:45,731
You ready?

12
00:00:45,756 --> 00:00:48,520
Oh hey, did you hear about the signals from Sugawara?

13
00:00:48,731 --> 00:00:49,793
Yeah, he told me.

14
00:00:53,213 --> 00:00:54,109
All right!

15
00:00:54,682 --> 00:00:55,811
Let's go all in!

16
00:00:56,423 --> 00:00:57,444
You got it!

17
00:02:28,301 --> 00:02:30,967
Let's go, go-go-go-go SeiJOH!

18
00:02:31,027 --> 00:02:33,377
Go, go-go-go-go SeiJOH!

19
00:02:33,402 --> 00:02:34,903
It's been pretty nerve-wracking huh?

20
00:02:35,484 --> 00:02:37,590
Trust me, nobody knows that more than me.

21
00:02:37,978 --> 00:02:38,965
What do you mean?

22
00:02:39,651 --> 00:02:43,164
Up until last year's tournament, I
didn't get to play in many official games.

23
00:02:43,209 --> 00:02:46,360
You know, because the third-year players
had all the seniority and everything...

24
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:50,904
And now when I have the seniority, Kageyama
actually has more court experience than I do.

25
00:02:51,621 --> 00:02:55,373
And yet he still lets himself
get all worked up... So weird.

26
00:02:55,657 --> 00:02:58,806
Well... looks like it's already his turn to serve.

27
00:02:59,317 --> 00:03:01,220
You think he'll be able to hold his own?

28
00:03:01,342 --> 00:03:02,755
Alright, Kageyama!

29
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:04,035
You got this, bro!

30
00:03:06,207 --> 00:03:08,018
Kageyama looks happy, doesn't he?

31
00:03:08,329 --> 00:03:09,027
Sure does.

32
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:11,722
Well, hopefully that'll be good for us.

33
00:03:11,937 --> 00:03:12,671
What do you mean?

34
00:03:13,617 --> 00:03:14,916
I've just been thinking...

35
00:03:15,554 --> 00:03:19,526
every player seems to have the same sort of
pride when it comes to being put in a game.

36
00:03:20,703 --> 00:03:23,423
Great players like him and average Joes too.

37
00:03:24,429 --> 00:03:26,869
Kageyama! Don't stress, okay?

38
00:03:28,902 --> 00:03:31,621
Oh... Nevermind... He's fine.

39
00:03:38,576 --> 00:03:40,113
We just need one point!

40
00:03:40,438 --> 00:03:41,322
Yeah!

41
00:03:48,655 --> 00:03:49,523
Watari!

42
00:03:52,623 --> 00:03:53,938
A service ace!

43
00:03:53,963 --> 00:03:55,120
The libero messed it up!

44
00:03:55,913 --> 00:03:56,799
Now they're tied!

45
00:03:57,564 --> 00:03:58,299
Gotcha!

46
00:03:59,076 --> 00:03:59,854
I'm sorry.

47
00:04:00,367 --> 00:04:02,100
It's okay, just keep trying!

48
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:03,896
Up high!

49
00:04:04,729 --> 00:04:05,195
Hm?

50
00:04:05,933 --> 00:04:07,473
Up high!

51
00:04:09,889 --> 00:04:11,215
He wants a high 10!

52
00:04:11,952 --> 00:04:13,421
We did it!

53
00:04:13,794 --> 00:04:16,218
Wait, that's not the Kageyama I know.

54
00:04:16,643 --> 00:04:17,128
Nope.

55
00:04:24,071 --> 00:04:25,223
Someone cover!

56
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:27,351
They're scattered!

57
00:04:27,376 --> 00:04:28,338
It's coming back!

58
00:04:29,359 --> 00:04:30,510
It's a chance ball!

59
00:04:33,071 --> 00:04:33,618
"Bring"?

60
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:34,840
Or "give"?

61
00:04:34,872 --> 00:04:35,817
Which one?

62
00:04:37,675 --> 00:04:39,081
He didn't say anything!

63
00:04:39,365 --> 00:04:43,240
Man, I still can't believe how
crazy Karasuno's quick-attack is!

64
00:04:43,573 --> 00:04:46,114
There we go! Finally turned it around!

65
00:04:47,462 --> 00:04:48,828
Sugawara's nice...

66
00:04:49,001 --> 00:04:51,410
He always compliments me when I do good things!

67
00:04:52,698 --> 00:04:53,703
Hey, Hinata.

68
00:04:55,538 --> 00:04:56,519
Proud... of you...

69
00:04:56,544 --> 00:04:57,418
Thank you...?

70
00:04:58,928 --> 00:05:04,489
Alright, Hinata's really in his element now! And
Kageyama looks just like a fish in water out there.

71
00:05:06,147 --> 00:05:08,629
Well his name does mean flying fish...

72
00:05:08,654 --> 00:05:09,534
Oh great.

73
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:11,908
Hey... let's all relax.

74
00:05:12,301 --> 00:05:15,460
Don't panic and let yourselves
get thrown off like they did.

75
00:05:15,965 --> 00:05:18,311
Once we gain back a point, we're golden.

76
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:19,762
Right!

77
00:05:19,817 --> 00:05:24,193
Hey... you. Stop posing like that... It pisses me off.

78
00:05:24,218 --> 00:05:25,316
You're not helping!

79
00:05:28,994 --> 00:05:29,614
Got it!

80
00:05:31,182 --> 00:05:32,182
Good one, Iwa!

81
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:38,927
Looks like Kageyama's gotten his rhythm back...

82
00:05:39,593 --> 00:05:41,516
No, there's more to it than that.

83
00:05:42,007 --> 00:05:43,634
I should have lined up a bit closer to the sideline.

84
00:05:43,659 --> 00:05:49,116
Before, his focus was glued on our blockers... but
now he's paying a little more attention to his teammates.

85
00:05:56,255 --> 00:05:58,015
Don't hold back now, boys...

86
00:05:58,648 --> 00:06:00,814
If we don't take this set, we're screwed.

87
00:06:01,407 --> 00:06:03,369
Turbo-charge that freak quick.

88
00:06:04,203 --> 00:06:05,428
Have some o' this!

89
00:06:06,261 --> 00:06:07,606
Nice receive!

90
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:12,415
Kageyama told Hinata that he's only
the greatest whenever he's around.

91
00:06:17,033 --> 00:06:17,400
But...

92
00:06:18,884 --> 00:06:20,315
it goes both ways.

93
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,880
Thanks to that combo attack...

94
00:06:26,111 --> 00:06:27,612
they're both the greatest!

95
00:06:27,792 --> 00:06:30,805
Sweet! Our guys made it to 20 points first!

96
00:06:31,105 --> 00:06:32,967
This is the final stretch.

97
00:06:37,632 --> 00:06:39,518
Alright, that's 20 points.

98
00:06:40,298 --> 00:06:41,127
And now...

99
00:06:41,973 --> 00:06:44,103
the real challenge is about to begin.

100
00:06:46,546 --> 00:06:50,161
Hey, since when is this all
about Tsukishima versus Kageyama?!

101
00:06:50,477 --> 00:06:51,514
C'mon, Hinata!

102
00:06:51,539 --> 00:06:52,512
Here goes!

103
00:06:54,633 --> 00:06:55,404
Look out!

104
00:06:56,537 --> 00:06:57,377
Chance ball!

105
00:06:57,858 --> 00:06:58,678
Kageyama!

106
00:07:04,237 --> 00:07:05,617
Any thoughts Asahi?

107
00:07:05,992 --> 00:07:07,339
A little higher maybe?

108
00:07:07,646 --> 00:07:08,197
Sure!

109
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:13,031
Oh. Seijoh's finally calling time out.

110
00:07:18,257 --> 00:07:21,767
You know, whenever number 10 goes
back and number 11 goes up front,

111
00:07:21,792 --> 00:07:23,989
Karasuno doesn't do as many center attacks.

112
00:07:24,203 --> 00:07:28,506
True... Though that might just be because
Kageyama doesn't like the tall angry fella.

113
00:07:30,489 --> 00:07:34,249
They weren't communicating during
yesterday's game, and today isn't any better...

114
00:07:34,407 --> 00:07:40,365
I think of all Karasuno's spikers, the beanpole is the
one Kageyama finds the most difficult to connect with.

115
00:07:40,658 --> 00:07:43,499
Please remind me to never become friends with you, Oikawa.

116
00:07:43,524 --> 00:07:44,475
Why is that?!

117
00:07:44,539 --> 00:07:46,444
You point out people's weaknesses.

118
00:07:46,469 --> 00:07:49,358
Oh gimme a break I'm just trying to strategize here!

119
00:07:50,504 --> 00:07:54,689
I think he talks to all the spikers so he can get
a feel for their emotional state during the game...

120
00:07:54,831 --> 00:07:57,924
Helps him decide how to set. Because everyone's different.

121
00:08:01,216 --> 00:08:01,840
What?

122
00:08:03,773 --> 00:08:05,799
I can't read this guy at all.

123
00:08:05,886 --> 00:08:08,834
All I know is that looking at him pisses me off!

124
00:08:08,994 --> 00:08:09,818
Kageyama.

125
00:08:10,344 --> 00:08:12,055
Just start with a conversation...

126
00:08:12,397 --> 00:08:13,848
Try to be more direct.

127
00:08:14,253 --> 00:08:16,260
You need to communicate with him okay.

128
00:08:18,575 --> 00:08:19,237
Okay.

129
00:08:25,093 --> 00:08:25,733
Got it!

130
00:08:30,442 --> 00:08:31,109
Nice receive!

131
00:08:31,134 --> 00:08:33,303
They got it... Watch that counter!

132
00:08:33,587 --> 00:08:36,647
Tsukishima seems to be having
trouble hitting the ball now.

133
00:08:39,623 --> 00:08:40,642
They just caught up!

134
00:08:40,667 --> 00:08:42,102
Ah crap, man, we're tied!

135
00:08:42,157 --> 00:08:43,102
It's break time.

136
00:08:43,174 --> 00:08:44,230
I know I need one!

137
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:45,469
Takeda!

138
00:08:45,883 --> 00:08:46,530
Right!

139
00:08:49,282 --> 00:08:52,132
So uh... do they need more attack power or what?

140
00:08:52,299 --> 00:08:56,023
Karasuno's in kind of a tight spot
now that their number 10's not up front.

141
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:00,114
Hey, what's with you guys?! You need to relax!

142
00:09:00,954 --> 00:09:03,806
You're all doing fine! So just chill out!

143
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,113
Okay...!

144
00:09:05,902 --> 00:09:06,415
Hey.

145
00:09:08,476 --> 00:09:11,016
Was that last set decent enough for you, punk?

146
00:09:12,865 --> 00:09:15,125
Why do you sound like Tanaka all of a sudden?

147
00:09:15,225 --> 00:09:16,376
What was that, punk?!

148
00:09:18,947 --> 00:09:23,025
I hate your sets because it's like you're forcing
people to play it your way instead of their own.

149
00:09:24,056 --> 00:09:25,560
Again with this, Tsukishima?

150
00:09:26,038 --> 00:09:29,412
Come on, this isn't the time
to be bickering like little kids!

151
00:09:29,589 --> 00:09:30,610
What are you saying?

152
00:09:33,961 --> 00:09:35,765
I like to do things my way...

153
00:09:36,141 --> 00:09:37,872
So please be consistent.

154
00:09:39,485 --> 00:09:41,242
Um... what's wrong?

155
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:47,849
I think... whenever Kageyama sets an A-Quick for
Tsukishima, he's also signaling its hitting course.

156
00:09:48,901 --> 00:09:51,550
A position near the setter means cross-court.

157
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:54,110
And away is turn-swing.

158
00:09:54,975 --> 00:09:59,252
Obviously, Kageyama places the ball
wherever he thinks the spike should be going.

159
00:09:59,544 --> 00:10:03,091
But Tsukishima probably has a hard time
hitting anything like that.

160
00:10:03,997 --> 00:10:06,181
You're not the only one out there thinking, you know.

161
00:10:07,099 --> 00:10:11,007
Whether it's about defense formation
or deciding what attacks to use,

162
00:10:11,124 --> 00:10:13,612
everyone on the team is always thinking.

163
00:10:14,283 --> 00:10:17,262
Hinata was able to figure out
how to do those quick attacks.

164
00:10:17,287 --> 00:10:19,879
So even that poor dummy is out there using his brain...

165
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:21,543
Well maybe not that much.

166
00:10:21,568 --> 00:10:24,527
Did you say "not much"?! I think all the time, jerk!

167
00:10:24,552 --> 00:10:25,534
Now, now...

168
00:10:25,685 --> 00:10:26,673
That's fair.

169
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,863
Wait, what did you just say? Are you sick?

170
00:10:31,223 --> 00:10:34,264
Let's try it your way... Maybe it'll work out for us.

171
00:10:39,713 --> 00:10:44,946
Tsukishima must not be used to dealing with that
kind of directness. He doesn't know how to take it.

172
00:10:47,613 --> 00:10:48,739
Good job, Noya!

173
00:10:50,887 --> 00:10:52,721
I like to do things my way...

174
00:10:53,107 --> 00:10:54,944
So please be consistent.

175
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:02,160
Dammit!

176
00:11:03,902 --> 00:11:07,329
Y'see that?! He hit the empty zone right behind the block!

177
00:11:07,354 --> 00:11:08,824
That was kickass!

178
00:11:08,849 --> 00:11:10,624
I'm actually kinda jealous!

179
00:11:11,676 --> 00:11:14,299
I thought he was going to spike it at the last second.

180
00:11:14,412 --> 00:11:17,629
He's almost got a glow about him
when he gets past the blockers, huh?

181
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,213
A glow?

182
00:11:19,561 --> 00:11:22,490
Uh-huh, that's how Tsukki looks
when he's really into the game.

183
00:11:25,572 --> 00:11:26,746
You've got a chance ball!

184
00:11:29,338 --> 00:11:30,436
Another trick!

185
00:11:31,892 --> 00:11:32,366
That was close!

186
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:34,166
Heads up! Chance ball!

187
00:11:34,426 --> 00:11:36,194
That Number 11's got game.

188
00:11:36,323 --> 00:11:37,215
I guess so...

189
00:11:37,404 --> 00:11:40,902
But it looks like he's just trying to
avoid confrontation with Seijoh's high-block.

190
00:11:41,398 --> 00:11:44,248
You're right, Karasuno keeps creating diversions.

191
00:11:44,354 --> 00:11:47,225
Yeah well... He can't run from those blockers forever.

192
00:11:49,608 --> 00:11:51,930
Yeah!

193
00:11:54,104 --> 00:11:55,249
Nice, Matsu!

194
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:58,682
Dammit... they already took it back.

195
00:11:59,683 --> 00:12:00,923
Center, 11!

196
00:12:03,144 --> 00:12:05,075
Again? I'll get it this time!

197
00:12:06,863 --> 00:12:08,434
Nice receive, Watari!

198
00:12:08,994 --> 00:12:09,731
I've got it!

199
00:12:09,756 --> 00:12:10,433
Center!

200
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:15,732
Good work, Tanaka!

201
00:12:15,938 --> 00:12:16,856
Ah, dammit.

202
00:12:17,471 --> 00:12:19,114
They better be careful right here.

203
00:12:19,285 --> 00:12:20,942
This play will make or break it.

204
00:12:21,592 --> 00:12:22,841
It's up to the ace.

205
00:12:26,555 --> 00:12:29,030
Everyone on the team is always thinking.

206
00:12:31,486 --> 00:12:32,880
Number 11 again!

207
00:12:33,064 --> 00:12:35,842
No, wait! Don't move! Stay where you are!

208
00:12:39,283 --> 00:12:41,177
Yeah!

209
00:12:41,202 --> 00:12:42,557
AWW YEAH!

210
00:12:42,856 --> 00:12:45,662
Tsukishima, you magnificent bastard!

211
00:12:45,843 --> 00:12:46,223
Nice one!

212
00:12:46,248 --> 00:12:47,089
Get out of my face.

213
00:12:47,114 --> 00:12:52,634
We were anticipating a fakeout, so our
defense was too far forward... They got us.

214
00:12:53,608 --> 00:12:56,858
Uh.. Gugu... gugu... good job...

215
00:12:58,752 --> 00:13:00,511
Don't hurt yourself, Kageyama.

216
00:13:00,992 --> 00:13:04,069
Wow... He actually complimented Tsukishima.

217
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:08,339
Kageyama is changing, no doubt about it.

218
00:13:08,957 --> 00:13:11,422
What are you, emotionally constipated?!

219
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:15,200
Set point for Karasuno!

220
00:13:15,225 --> 00:13:16,589
This is crazy.

221
00:13:16,614 --> 00:13:17,749
One more point!

222
00:13:17,774 --> 00:13:19,064
You can do it!

223
00:13:23,843 --> 00:13:25,077
Not gonna happen!

224
00:13:25,102 --> 00:13:28,582
I-wai-zu-mi! I-wai-zu-mi! Geeet thaaaat point!

225
00:13:28,607 --> 00:13:35,149
It's alright! Look... the last point is no different
than all the others you've scored; You can win!

226
00:14:05,794 --> 00:14:06,674
Well done!

227
00:14:08,342 --> 00:14:09,486
Our last tournament.

228
00:14:11,242 --> 00:14:12,614
The end of middle school.

229
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:15,424
Hey, you have a genuine smile for once.

230
00:14:15,449 --> 00:14:18,484
What? My smiles are always honest and delightful!

231
00:14:18,695 --> 00:14:21,454
If you have to say they are,
that means they're probably not.

232
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:23,829
I've never gotten one of these before...

233
00:14:23,889 --> 00:14:25,864
so why wouldn't I be happy, huh?

234
00:14:27,657 --> 00:14:31,889
Toru Oikawa laughs everything off... but
there was a time when he couldn't do that.

235
00:14:34,264 --> 00:14:35,688
He had a sturdy build.

236
00:14:37,195 --> 00:14:39,104
Plus he was smart and swift.

237
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:43,585
And he just kept getting better and
better, especially after middle school.

238
00:14:45,159 --> 00:14:48,979
But still, there was always a
brick wall standing in his way.

239
00:14:49,792 --> 00:14:53,290
Shiratorizawa, now known as the best in the prefecture,

240
00:14:54,032 --> 00:14:56,874
had just brought in Ushiwaka, their new heavy.

241
00:14:59,432 --> 00:15:01,009
Why can't I beat them?!

242
00:15:02,149 --> 00:15:03,932
They cleaned the floor with us.

243
00:15:04,482 --> 00:15:06,090
We didn't even win a set.

244
00:15:07,397 --> 00:15:10,182
We wanted to keep climbing and reach new heights...

245
00:15:11,197 --> 00:15:13,759
but we kept getting defeated until our third year...

246
00:15:14,715 --> 00:15:15,427
And then...

247
00:15:16,109 --> 00:15:19,049
I'm Tobio Kageyama from Akiyama Elementary School...

248
00:15:19,389 --> 00:15:22,510
I've played this game for years... Nice to meet you.

249
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,869
A genius swooped in to take our place.

250
00:15:27,329 --> 00:15:29,761
There was no mistaking his overwhelming talent.

251
00:15:31,533 --> 00:15:35,487
Kageyama always looked so overjoyed
just to be playing volleyball.

252
00:15:36,379 --> 00:15:40,305
His fire and his technical expertise
put him miles ahead of the rest of us.

253
00:15:41,061 --> 00:15:44,340
He can play just about any position we need him to,

254
00:15:44,654 --> 00:15:46,507
but he'll eventually be a setter.

255
00:15:46,834 --> 00:15:47,513
Yeah.

256
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:52,309
After that, Oikawa started to
push himself harder than ever.

257
00:15:54,527 --> 00:15:56,304
You're working way too hard!

258
00:15:57,004 --> 00:15:58,906
Didn't the coach just say that yesterday?

259
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,504
You'll be useless to us if you get hurt!

260
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:06,606
Come on, it's time to call it a day!

261
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:09,117
He was completely losing his cool.

262
00:16:10,054 --> 00:16:14,947
During a practice game, his constant combo
mistakes made it clear he was lacking composure.

263
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:17,892
Which led to...

264
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:22,417
Kageyama, you're in!

265
00:16:22,442 --> 00:16:23,083
Sir!

266
00:16:23,694 --> 00:16:24,612
Okay. Go in.

267
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:27,915
Forward!

268
00:16:28,188 --> 00:16:28,772
Got it!

269
00:16:30,481 --> 00:16:31,581
Nice cover!

270
00:16:32,147 --> 00:16:33,258
Nice kill!

271
00:16:33,718 --> 00:16:34,597
Serve's up!

272
00:16:45,767 --> 00:16:46,609
Oikawa?

273
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:50,313
Can you maybe teach me how to serve?

274
00:16:57,468 --> 00:16:58,732
Get away from me...

275
00:17:00,087 --> 00:17:00,947
Go away...

276
00:17:01,592 --> 00:17:02,977
Just go away!

277
00:17:04,177 --> 00:17:05,848
Don't come any closer!

278
00:17:11,325 --> 00:17:13,505
Get a hold of yourself, you dumb-ass!

279
00:17:16,724 --> 00:17:17,651
Sorry...

280
00:17:18,107 --> 00:17:20,621
Kageyama. We're all done for today.

281
00:17:21,097 --> 00:17:22,203
O-Okay.

282
00:17:28,356 --> 00:17:31,252
We swapped you out today because
you needed to cool your head.

283
00:17:31,947 --> 00:17:33,710
Give yourself a little credit, alright?!

284
00:17:36,658 --> 00:17:38,059
I can't do that!

285
00:17:38,084 --> 00:17:40,984
Not if I'm not good enough to bring down Shiratorizawa!

286
00:17:41,022 --> 00:17:45,392
If I want to win and go to Nationals,
I need to work as hard as I can!

287
00:17:46,568 --> 00:17:49,221
All you ever say is "me, me, me"!

288
00:17:51,477 --> 00:17:53,958
What, do you think you're the only person on this team?!

289
00:17:54,289 --> 00:17:56,006
You listen to me, dumb-ass!

290
00:17:56,031 --> 00:18:01,067
You'd better stop acting like your performance is the
only thing that matters or I'll headbutt you in the face!

291
00:18:01,092 --> 00:18:02,420
You already did!

292
00:18:02,697 --> 00:18:06,310
I'm sure none of us has what it
takes to defeat Ushiwaka one-on-one...

293
00:18:07,077 --> 00:18:08,050
But still...

294
00:18:08,302 --> 00:18:11,204
That's why there's 6 people on a volleyball court!

295
00:18:12,384 --> 00:18:15,894
Who cares about that amazing first-year... or Ushiwaka?!

296
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:19,082
At the end of the day, the best team of 6 wins, dumb-ass!

297
00:18:21,936 --> 00:18:24,084
The best group of 6 wins, huh?

298
00:18:28,334 --> 00:18:30,764
Whoa... Sorry, I must have hit you too hard.

299
00:18:32,133 --> 00:18:34,855
I can't even describe how I feel right now.

300
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:37,798
It's like I'm invincible.

301
00:18:38,972 --> 00:18:42,175
Hey Iwa, is "dumb-ass" the only insult you know?

302
00:18:42,209 --> 00:18:44,414
You want another headbutt to the face?

303
00:18:47,269 --> 00:18:49,879
Perfect! One more point!

304
00:18:50,595 --> 00:18:53,669
How about that? Oikawa seems to be over his funk now.

305
00:18:54,176 --> 00:18:55,093
Good.

306
00:18:56,104 --> 00:18:58,440
Hey, Oikawa... could you teach me how to serve-toss?

307
00:18:58,465 --> 00:19:00,534
Yeah right, in your dreams, dummy!

308
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:02,889
Stop picking on the first-year, Oikawa.

309
00:19:04,983 --> 00:19:06,792
In our last middle school tournament...

310
00:19:07,167 --> 00:19:10,328
we won the first set against Shiratorizawa Middle School.

311
00:19:12,828 --> 00:19:14,700
We ended up winning 2nd place to them.

312
00:19:15,966 --> 00:19:18,135
Oikawa got the best setter award.

313
00:19:19,281 --> 00:19:23,142
Second place... That means our
spikers gave it their very best.

314
00:19:24,784 --> 00:19:27,652
Yeah, but it also means Ushiwaka's even better.

315
00:19:28,363 --> 00:19:29,054
Damn it...

316
00:19:30,253 --> 00:19:31,221
I'll beat him...

317
00:19:32,288 --> 00:19:33,495
I swear I will!

318
00:19:34,809 --> 00:19:36,867
I'll humiliate that whole team!

319
00:19:37,427 --> 00:19:38,696
Yeah, same here!

320
00:19:39,515 --> 00:19:41,164
And you too dummy!

321
00:19:41,976 --> 00:19:44,681
I don't know what high school
you'll be at in a few years...

322
00:19:44,868 --> 00:19:48,516
but I swear, as soon as I get a chance,
I'm kicking your ass, you hear me?!

323
00:19:48,864 --> 00:19:51,210
Don't talk all big with a runny nose.

324
00:19:51,447 --> 00:19:52,528
You need a tissue?

325
00:19:52,748 --> 00:19:53,608
Shut up!

326
00:19:54,209 --> 00:19:56,679
Let's go, go-go-go-go SeiJOH!

327
00:19:56,706 --> 00:19:58,834
Go, go-go-go-go SeiJOH!

328
00:19:58,859 --> 00:19:59,399
Let's go!

329
00:19:59,424 --> 00:20:00,054
Serve!

330
00:20:00,314 --> 00:20:01,058
Heads up!

331
00:20:01,573 --> 00:20:03,744
Uh-oh, time for Oikawa's serve.

332
00:20:05,228 --> 00:20:07,989
You're up against the guy who's second on your shit-list.

333
00:20:11,019 --> 00:20:12,850
So make it count, alright?

334
00:20:14,037 --> 00:20:15,400
Oh, I plan to.

335
00:20:16,218 --> 00:20:20,950
Oooooooolè.

336
00:20:22,405 --> 00:20:24,114
Yours!

337
00:20:25,895 --> 00:20:27,189
There it goes!

338
00:20:28,137 --> 00:20:30,226
Crap, it's heading right back to Seijoh!

339
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:35,211
If he'd messed up that serve, it would've
cost them the whole set! This guy's good!

340
00:20:37,259 --> 00:20:38,367
It's a chance ball!

341
00:20:40,804 --> 00:20:42,522
It came right back to the setter.

342
00:20:42,883 --> 00:20:46,058
The quick attacks from the center
give them a higher success rate.

343
00:20:48,733 --> 00:20:52,187
I knew it, that's exactly what I would do!

344
00:20:52,692 --> 00:20:56,859
Oikawa's back's against the wall,
so I'm guessing his next move is...

345
00:20:57,092 --> 00:20:58,486
send it to Iwa!

346
00:21:10,327 --> 00:21:13,335
Yeah!

347
00:21:13,435 --> 00:21:14,162
No way!

348
00:21:14,187 --> 00:21:16,190
Karasuno just took back the set!

349
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:18,601
Dammit, I'll kill that little shit!

350
00:21:18,626 --> 00:21:19,387
Chill out.

351
00:21:19,699 --> 00:21:22,703
Hey, what's so funny, jerk?!
You wanna fight or somethin'?!

352
00:21:22,751 --> 00:21:24,895
Violence doesn't look good on you, Iwa.

353
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:29,097
Relax. I only threaten you, and you know I won't hit you.

354
00:21:31,102 --> 00:21:31,916
You know...

355
00:21:32,369 --> 00:21:35,306
that last quick from the center
was one of our best attacks.

356
00:21:35,866 --> 00:21:36,472
Yeah?

357
00:21:36,934 --> 00:21:39,052
Yet Kageyama was able to stop it.

358
00:21:39,578 --> 00:21:41,670
He predicted I would send it left.

359
00:21:42,351 --> 00:21:43,773
Do you know what that means?

360
00:21:44,579 --> 00:21:47,077
He wasn't behaving robotically like usual...

361
00:21:47,644 --> 00:21:53,641
No, he noticed our weak spot near the end...
not to mention our unbreakable bond of trust.

362
00:21:53,783 --> 00:21:55,511
We don't have that and you know it.

363
00:21:55,811 --> 00:21:58,807
My point is, he just made a solid judgment call.

364
00:22:00,697 --> 00:22:01,827
That other setter...

365
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,306
What did he teach our Tobio?

366
00:22:06,597 --> 00:22:10,679
That little self-serving dictator is
on his way to becoming a real leader.

367
00:22:11,901 --> 00:22:16,393
What is this feeling? I'm incredibly irritated, and yet...

368
00:22:21,355 --> 00:22:23,730
Set 3! It's time to start!

369
00:22:24,494 --> 00:22:25,674
Let's do this.

370
00:23:59,768 --> 00:24:01,190
Time for the final set!

371
00:24:01,392 --> 00:24:04,071
I'm fired up! This isn't like me at all.

372
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:05,431
Yeah, I'll say.

373
00:24:05,551 --> 00:24:07,466
What about my icy-cool image?

374
00:24:07,491 --> 00:24:09,428
Forget about your damn image!

375
00:24:09,453 --> 00:24:12,143
Next Haikyu!! "The Play to Change The Flow."
