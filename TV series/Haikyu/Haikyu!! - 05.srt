1
00:00:07,295 --> 00:00:12,950
Be extra alert. Ball... blocker... spiker.

2
00:00:13,802 --> 00:00:15,524
Observe every single move.

3
00:00:19,225 --> 00:00:22,052
Line up your timing with the
spiker's optimum hitting height...

4
00:00:22,902 --> 00:00:23,790
And shoot!

5
00:00:27,807 --> 00:00:28,454
Wow.

6
00:00:28,482 --> 00:00:29,644
They did it again!

7
00:00:29,669 --> 00:00:30,954
They turned it around!

8
00:00:31,612 --> 00:00:33,815
One more point and they're gonna take the first set.

9
00:00:35,019 --> 00:00:36,254
His timing's better...

10
00:00:36,912 --> 00:00:38,511
It's improving by the second!

11
00:00:39,268 --> 00:00:43,526
Impressive, this must be Kageyama's
setting ability at its best!

12
00:00:43,867 --> 00:00:47,061
Yeah! Yeah! That was freakin' perfect!

13
00:00:47,086 --> 00:00:51,026
But the person who brought it out of him... was Hinata!

14
00:00:51,405 --> 00:00:52,790
We're on a roll!

15
00:02:27,442 --> 00:02:29,455
The kid does have some patience.

16
00:02:30,768 --> 00:02:31,301
Oops.

17
00:02:32,265 --> 00:02:35,564
I've never seen anybody take a
set directly to the face before...

18
00:02:36,034 --> 00:02:38,236
You're not getting past me this time, kid!

19
00:02:44,053 --> 00:02:45,139
Oh really?

20
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:50,612
Yikes... he'd better keep a close eye on Tanaka too.

21
00:02:53,656 --> 00:02:54,365
Dammit.

22
00:02:55,047 --> 00:03:00,974
Ohhh! You like that? 'Sup, Tsukishima?!
Not talkin' so big anymore, huh?!

23
00:03:00,999 --> 00:03:02,453
Yeah, what he said!

24
00:03:02,478 --> 00:03:05,093
Ooh, I wish you'd try something, boy!

25
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,030
Yeah, go ahead and try!

26
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:10,436
Why are you doing more trash talking than Hinata is?

27
00:03:10,517 --> 00:03:10,969
Huh?

28
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:13,954
Exactly! Without the first-years,
you never would have made that hit!

29
00:03:13,979 --> 00:03:15,222
Yeah, don't get all cocky!

30
00:03:15,247 --> 00:03:16,715
Keep your clothes on!

31
00:03:16,853 --> 00:03:20,090
Look, I don't need any more smart
remarks from the peanut gallery!

32
00:03:21,662 --> 00:03:25,815
You know... Tsukishima's team doesn't
have a lot of initiative on their side...

33
00:03:26,402 --> 00:03:30,230
So the best thing they can do is try
to block all those aggressive attacks.

34
00:03:33,315 --> 00:03:34,698
Time for the second set!

35
00:03:35,015 --> 00:03:36,074
Ready!

36
00:03:36,099 --> 00:03:36,740
Yeah!

37
00:03:44,694 --> 00:03:45,347
Alright!

38
00:04:04,463 --> 00:04:05,431
Not today!

39
00:04:05,632 --> 00:04:07,026
Suck it, nerds!

40
00:04:08,495 --> 00:04:09,155
Whoa...

41
00:04:09,371 --> 00:04:15,287
Kageyama's pretty amazing. And man, all those
precision sets! He's really gotta stay focused.

42
00:04:16,146 --> 00:04:19,035
Not to mention Hinata's running
around even more than usual.

43
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:21,913
Yeah... but...

44
00:04:25,997 --> 00:04:27,325
Yesss!

45
00:04:29,617 --> 00:04:30,637
They're having fun.

46
00:04:36,487 --> 00:04:37,312
Good game!

47
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:42,227
Hey... Hm? Quick question, you guys.

48
00:04:42,589 --> 00:04:46,940
After what you both said before, it's like you
already knew they were able to master that move...

49
00:04:47,225 --> 00:04:48,551
you're telepathic?!

50
00:04:48,678 --> 00:04:49,332
Huh?

51
00:04:50,488 --> 00:04:54,764
Let them work on a few combinations,
and Karasuno will have the perfect team!

52
00:04:55,438 --> 00:04:58,276
It's up to you to use his talents more effectively!

53
00:04:59,203 --> 00:05:01,095
What?! That is ridiculous!

54
00:05:01,119 --> 00:05:05,307
All I was telling Kageyama to do was start
setting Hinata up with something he could hit!

55
00:05:05,662 --> 00:05:12,053
Yeah, sorry... I'm afraid I'm not a psychic either...
I just thought Hinata could adapt to his crazy sets.

56
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:15,175
Anyway... I gotta admit I'm happy.

57
00:05:15,401 --> 00:05:15,892
What?

58
00:05:18,507 --> 00:05:22,738
Basically... I was hoping for something like this...

59
00:05:23,349 --> 00:05:25,552
Hinata turned it into this.

60
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:30,861
He may be green, but Hinata's
got raw speed and jumping power...

61
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,522
Kageyama's advanced techniques
are a perfect complement to that.

62
00:05:35,548 --> 00:05:38,662
And when you pair them up, they
bring out the best in each other.

63
00:05:40,064 --> 00:05:40,616
Just forget it out... Nobody cares.

64
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:44,443
Turns out... we got even better
results than I could ever had hoped for.

65
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:45,786
See? Look.

66
00:05:46,607 --> 00:05:47,552
Tsukishima!

67
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:48,528
Huh?

68
00:05:51,304 --> 00:05:52,120
What now?

69
00:05:52,431 --> 00:05:57,331
You're supposed to shake hands before and after a
game... I guess we sorta skipped the first one...

70
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:59,915
And even though I may not really like this at all...

71
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:02,283
You're my teammate now.

72
00:06:04,991 --> 00:06:08,762
Just do it! Hey look, I know it's awkward...

73
00:06:08,907 --> 00:06:13,385
But take it from me, if you can't play nice with your
teammates, these guys'll kick you right out of the gym!

74
00:06:13,796 --> 00:06:16,513
Look, I know I wasn't around
when it happened or anything...

75
00:06:16,761 --> 00:06:20,573
But I'm pretty sure that was because you
disobeyed the captain and picked a fight...

76
00:06:20,597 --> 00:06:22,815
And knocked the vice principal's toupee off.

77
00:06:24,205 --> 00:06:27,209
Y-you don't have to get into the details.

78
00:06:27,899 --> 00:06:28,994
Shake my hand!

79
00:06:30,939 --> 00:06:32,365
Stop that, you idiot!

80
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:35,129
So dramatic... First-years, right?

81
00:06:35,638 --> 00:06:37,661
I am so sorry that happened!

82
00:06:38,129 --> 00:06:39,124
Tsukishima?

83
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:43,594
So what'd you think? Did you have some fun?

84
00:06:44,934 --> 00:06:46,320
It wasn't a big deal?

85
00:06:46,638 --> 00:06:48,837
They've got a star from a great school...

86
00:06:49,114 --> 00:06:53,087
A bunch of lowly commoners like us
never even stood a chance and you know it.

87
00:06:53,836 --> 00:06:54,551
Really?

88
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:57,300
It seemed like a big deal to you.

89
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:00,715
You fought pretty hard out there... here.

90
00:07:06,772 --> 00:07:07,597
Captain!

91
00:07:08,238 --> 00:07:08,718
Hm?

92
00:07:08,828 --> 00:07:09,488
Yes?

93
00:07:18,894 --> 00:07:22,335
Kiyoko! They should already be here, right?

94
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:23,441
Mm-hm...

95
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,729
Huh? What?

96
00:07:31,232 --> 00:07:31,783
Hm?

97
00:07:35,595 --> 00:07:36,471
Whoaaaa!

98
00:07:39,534 --> 00:07:43,954
I'm fairly sure I got the right sizes for
you... Let me know if you need replacements.

99
00:07:44,057 --> 00:07:44,893
Thanks!

100
00:07:45,535 --> 00:07:47,268
Go ahead, why don't you try it on?

101
00:07:47,368 --> 00:07:49,032
I can just try it on later-.

102
00:07:49,057 --> 00:07:52,088
Put it on, bro! Get over yourself, would ya?

103
00:07:52,446 --> 00:07:56,119
Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it!

104
00:07:56,144 --> 00:07:57,460
Whoa!

105
00:08:02,326 --> 00:08:04,532
Whooaa lookin' good, my man!

106
00:08:05,341 --> 00:08:07,548
Yeah, I agree, it really suits you!

107
00:08:07,698 --> 00:08:10,267
On behalf of the Karasuno volleyball club...

108
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,055
Welcome...

109
00:08:12,459 --> 00:08:13,645
to the team!

110
00:08:19,623 --> 00:08:20,406
Thanks!

111
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:24,936
Hey, strike a pose!

112
00:08:24,961 --> 00:08:26,166
Well, that's the first step.

113
00:08:26,191 --> 00:08:27,216
Not bad! Now try this way! Bah!

114
00:08:27,241 --> 00:08:30,980
I take it you and Tanaka gave those
two a little extra help, didn't you?

115
00:08:31,005 --> 00:08:33,036
Huh?! No.. Why would you think that?!

116
00:08:33,678 --> 00:08:38,550
Anyway, for now, I'm just glad everything
worked out... thanks a lot, you two.

117
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:39,082
Hm?

118
00:08:41,359 --> 00:08:42,151
Good work.

119
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,740
I didn't do anything.

120
00:08:44,008 --> 00:08:47,412
Hey, Hinata! Less talking, more practicing!

121
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,857
Let's run through the quick attack
again while you're still remembering how!

122
00:08:50,889 --> 00:08:51,796
Okay!

123
00:08:51,821 --> 00:08:53,296
Throw the ball over here, Tanaka!

124
00:08:53,796 --> 00:08:56,202
Huh?! Aren't you guys tired?!

125
00:08:57,916 --> 00:09:00,993
Hey! We got it! We got something!

126
00:09:03,092 --> 00:09:08,177
A practice game! With one of the
area's top 4! Aoba Johsai High School!

127
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:09,236
Those guys?!

128
00:09:09,308 --> 00:09:10,038
Come on...

129
00:09:10,062 --> 00:09:10,720
No way.

130
00:09:11,014 --> 00:09:13,357
We get to play against one of the top 4?!

131
00:09:13,784 --> 00:09:15,415
Aoba Johsai, huh?

132
00:09:17,005 --> 00:09:21,579
Oh, it's you two! You must be Hinata and Kageyama, right?

133
00:09:21,904 --> 00:09:23,788
Uh... who's that?

134
00:09:23,917 --> 00:09:24,809
No idea.

135
00:09:25,628 --> 00:09:27,311
My name's Ittetsu Takeda...

136
00:09:27,558 --> 00:09:28,734
Your club advisor.

137
00:09:29,228 --> 00:09:29,861
Hey.

138
00:09:30,383 --> 00:09:32,076
I'm clueless about this game...

139
00:09:32,227 --> 00:09:34,277
So I can't coach you on your technique...

140
00:09:34,421 --> 00:09:38,073
But I promise I'll try to help
you guys out wherever I can.. Okay?

141
00:09:38,288 --> 00:09:39,307
Uh, sure.

142
00:09:39,972 --> 00:09:40,729
So what's up?

143
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:42,881
Oh yeah, the game...

144
00:09:43,085 --> 00:09:47,448
Aoba Johsai, or Seijoh, as some people
call it, was the only school who said yes.

145
00:09:47,591 --> 00:09:51,048
That's crazy! So how'd you get
a game with a team like them?

146
00:09:51,595 --> 00:09:53,012
Wait, did you beg again?

147
00:09:53,354 --> 00:09:54,683
No, not this time!

148
00:09:54,773 --> 00:09:56,152
I am good at begging...

149
00:09:56,401 --> 00:09:57,496
But I didn't have to.

150
00:09:58,367 --> 00:10:01,236
Although... There is one little condition.

151
00:10:01,269 --> 00:10:01,899
What's that?

152
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:05,312
Kageyama has to be the setter for the whole game.

153
00:10:05,376 --> 00:10:05,958
Huh?

154
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:09,222
What the hell is that?!

155
00:10:09,247 --> 00:10:14,668
So they're not interested in playing against Karasuno, but
they've got some kinda special beef with Kageyama, huh?

156
00:10:14,701 --> 00:10:17,986
What are we, just some kinda
joke to them? What's their deeeeal?

157
00:10:18,032 --> 00:10:21,269
Um... no... I don't think that's the case...

158
00:10:21,294 --> 00:10:23,920
Let's do it... It's an opportunity.

159
00:10:24,021 --> 00:10:28,624
You sure about this, Suga?! You're the
official setter.. Doesn't this bug you, man?!

160
00:10:29,286 --> 00:10:33,877
Well... It's a chance for us to
use Hinata's and Kageyama's attack...

161
00:10:34,071 --> 00:10:37,220
Now we can see how good it truly
measures up against a really good team.

162
00:10:42,098 --> 00:10:44,211
Okay... what are the details, then?

163
00:10:44,245 --> 00:10:49,518
Well uh... let's see... The schedule's
a little tight, but it's next Tuesday.

164
00:10:50,253 --> 00:10:52,913
There's only time for the one
game since it's after school.

165
00:10:53,836 --> 00:10:56,898
It's a real game! A real freakin' game!

166
00:10:57,254 --> 00:11:01,151
My very first one since I came to
Karasuno High and joined the team!

167
00:11:01,216 --> 00:11:02,125
Don't be late.

168
00:11:02,696 --> 00:11:03,381
Right!

169
00:11:05,444 --> 00:11:06,495
Good work, guys!

170
00:11:06,762 --> 00:11:07,639
Thanks!

171
00:11:11,274 --> 00:11:11,986
Suga!

172
00:11:12,944 --> 00:11:13,337
Huh?

173
00:11:20,689 --> 00:11:23,703
I know it's not fair... that
I'll be in the starting line-up...

174
00:11:23,885 --> 00:11:26,588
But I promise to you I'll earn my spot from now on!

175
00:11:26,651 --> 00:11:27,073
What?

176
00:11:28,447 --> 00:11:33,991
Oh.. Sorry... I guess I'm just surprised that you
care how I feel about the whole thing.. That's all.

177
00:11:34,426 --> 00:11:36,599
Hm? I don't follow.

178
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:39,695
You've got more stamina and raw talent than me anyway.

179
00:11:39,729 --> 00:11:44,716
Who cares?! That's great and all, but they're
not the same as having experience! Besides...

180
00:11:44,741 --> 00:11:45,568
Suga!

181
00:11:45,631 --> 00:11:46,838
Sugawara!

182
00:11:49,046 --> 00:11:55,235
Um... you see, the rest of the team...
um... they... Well, they trust you.

183
00:11:56,265 --> 00:12:00,352
Whoa... That one bad game in middle school
must have really screwed with his head...

184
00:12:00,753 --> 00:12:04,032
Anyway... I swear... I won't lose!

185
00:12:06,051 --> 00:12:08,244
Yeah... I'll do my best too.

186
00:12:08,593 --> 00:12:12,944
Hey Suga! Daichi said he was gonna treat us to some food!

187
00:12:13,204 --> 00:12:14,884
So uh, I was thinking...

188
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:18,942
Most players from Kitagawa first end up
going to Aoba Johsai high school, right?

189
00:12:19,343 --> 00:12:21,066
Yeah, as far as I know.

190
00:12:22,786 --> 00:12:25,729
Does that mean we'll be up
against Kageyama's old teammates?

191
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:30,401
Yeah, that's what I thought... So, uh,
you think you're gonna be okay with that.

192
00:12:30,426 --> 00:12:34,475
Huh? Well, I guess it might be
weird if we were on the same team.

193
00:12:35,061 --> 00:12:38,099
But since we're opponents, I'll
fight them with everything I've got.

194
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,048
Okay... good to hear.

195
00:12:41,392 --> 00:12:41,995
Thanks.

196
00:12:42,363 --> 00:12:48,355
Are you sure you're okay with this, Suga? I mean,
c'mon... how can you just sit here and take this?!

197
00:12:49,367 --> 00:12:52,327
I'm not thrilled about it... but...

198
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:58,503
We gotta show those guys how much Kageyama's
changed since middle school... It'll be fine.

199
00:12:59,006 --> 00:12:59,725
That's right.

200
00:12:59,788 --> 00:13:00,348
Hm?

201
00:13:01,498 --> 00:13:06,373
And Kageyama's not the only one of us that
they'll have to watch out for. Right, Hinata?

202
00:13:09,865 --> 00:13:11,264
Sorry, what was that?

203
00:13:11,289 --> 00:13:13,924
Why are you stuffing your face before the rest of us?!

204
00:13:13,949 --> 00:13:14,886
You're such a pig!

205
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:18,206
Hey, volleyball loser! No fighting in front of my store!

206
00:13:18,627 --> 00:13:19,835
Sorry, sir.

207
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:24,928
That's right... we're the volleyball club!

208
00:13:25,244 --> 00:13:28,882
Everyone here is a part of the same group. The same team.

209
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,913
Wow, thanks... any curry buns in there?

210
00:13:34,216 --> 00:13:36,082
Save some room for dinner, would ya?

211
00:13:36,526 --> 00:13:38,893
Hey! Come get your food!

212
00:13:38,927 --> 00:13:39,698
Thank you!

213
00:13:41,284 --> 00:13:43,121
We are a team!

214
00:13:45,717 --> 00:13:47,721
Kageyama, could I have a word?

215
00:13:48,526 --> 00:13:49,565
Uh, sure.

216
00:13:50,055 --> 00:13:51,396
Keep the noise down.

217
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:55,490
I've been brainstorming about what Hinata's
position should be for the practice game.

218
00:13:56,025 --> 00:13:56,898
What do you think?

219
00:13:58,347 --> 00:13:59,012
Well...

220
00:14:15,233 --> 00:14:17,166
Let's talk positions for the practice game.

221
00:14:18,393 --> 00:14:19,931
Here's the plan I came up with.

222
00:14:23,704 --> 00:14:25,801
I'd like to have you two work as a pair.

223
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:27,313
A pair?

224
00:14:27,661 --> 00:14:33,610
And Tsukishima is our tallest player, so I want to
see how much of an advantage that gives us over Seijoh.

225
00:14:33,996 --> 00:14:35,256
Fiiiiine.

226
00:14:35,898 --> 00:14:38,122
All the other first-years are special...

227
00:14:38,385 --> 00:14:41,682
Wait, why is Hinata in the one
position that needs a tall guy?!

228
00:14:41,738 --> 00:14:46,384
Huh?! He's right! Why are Tsukishima and I
both playing the middle blocker position?!

229
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:50,381
Time out... I-I think I need to do
a quick review of all the positions.

230
00:14:51,301 --> 00:14:57,431
The setter... That's the control tower, the
one who sets people up and starts the attacks.

231
00:14:58,418 --> 00:15:04,378
The wing spiker... he's the all-rounder that sort
of maintains the balance between offense and defense.

232
00:15:05,193 --> 00:15:10,589
The middle blockers... they block the other
team's attacks and score points using quick attacks.

233
00:15:10,614 --> 00:15:13,931
They also act as a decoy to
lead the opposing blockers astray.

234
00:15:14,256 --> 00:15:15,846
Does that sound about right?

235
00:15:16,032 --> 00:15:18,897
Well, there's another one that specializes in defense...

236
00:15:19,104 --> 00:15:20,701
But we'll skip that part for now.

237
00:15:21,143 --> 00:15:22,291
Listen up, Hinata.

238
00:15:23,445 --> 00:15:26,113
Let's call you... Number one decoy!

239
00:15:26,138 --> 00:15:31,382
Yeaaaahhh! I'm the number one... decoy?

240
00:15:32,754 --> 00:15:34,954
Man, that sounds lame.

241
00:15:34,979 --> 00:15:37,670
We'll use you as a distraction while we rake in points.

242
00:15:37,695 --> 00:15:41,781
We'll be using quick attacks... That
way, the other spikers can do some damage!

243
00:15:42,023 --> 00:15:42,591
Huh?!

244
00:15:43,539 --> 00:15:49,498
You take the tall Tsukishima guys... But you can
lead them right into our trap like the idiots they are.

245
00:15:50,488 --> 00:15:51,758
How cool is that?

246
00:15:53,467 --> 00:15:54,691
That sounds so awesome!

247
00:15:54,716 --> 00:15:57,894
Hey! You better not be implying Tsukki's an idiot!

248
00:15:57,919 --> 00:15:59,449
Shut up, Tadashi.

249
00:15:59,938 --> 00:16:01,270
Oh, sorry, Tsukki.

250
00:16:01,488 --> 00:16:06,949
On the other hand, if you're not at the top of
your game, then all our other attacks will fall apart.

251
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:08,841
Stop it!

252
00:16:09,676 --> 00:16:11,453
You're gonna put too much pressure on him.

253
00:16:11,877 --> 00:16:14,226
Don't fall apart... Don't fall apart...

254
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:16,395
Don't fall apart... Don't fall apart...

255
00:16:16,428 --> 00:16:17,401
You broke him!

256
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:20,382
Yeah, but blocking is the most important thing here.

257
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:24,046
No matter how high he can jump,
he's still a shorty pants...

258
00:16:24,071 --> 00:16:28,206
By the time he gets to his highest
point, the taller guys'll already be there.

259
00:16:28,231 --> 00:16:32,085
Already thought of that. Hinata
won't be focusing on blocking...

260
00:16:32,219 --> 00:16:35,645
Instead of trying to slap down a
spike, he can just give it a tap...

261
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:39,696
We'll use his ridiculously fast
reflexes to their fullest potential.

262
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:44,000
If he taps an enemy spike, it
should slow down just enough.

263
00:16:45,392 --> 00:16:47,903
Then we just collect the ball and counterattack.

264
00:16:48,689 --> 00:16:51,121
You think he can pull that off without practice?

265
00:16:51,469 --> 00:16:52,172
I doubt it.

266
00:16:52,723 --> 00:16:53,203
Huh?

267
00:16:53,371 --> 00:16:55,436
Well, not on the first try at least.

268
00:16:56,382 --> 00:17:01,479
But you know, sometimes the attempt is what
really what matters... It is a practice game, right?

269
00:17:01,972 --> 00:17:02,475
Right.

270
00:17:03,466 --> 00:17:09,519
Besides... the only ones on our team who can beat
him in airborne combat are Tsukishima and Kageyama.

271
00:17:11,143 --> 00:17:12,932
So I just want you to do your best.

272
00:17:13,046 --> 00:17:17,096
Right! I won't mess up! I'll earn
lots of points and be the perfect decoy!

273
00:17:17,121 --> 00:17:19,449
I'll serve, I'll block, I'll do quick
attacks, whatever else you want me to do!

274
00:17:19,474 --> 00:17:20,399
Calm down!

275
00:17:21,473 --> 00:17:23,253
We've lost him! I think he just short-circuited!

276
00:17:23,278 --> 00:17:25,658
Oh crap, we killed him!

277
00:17:30,011 --> 00:17:32,483
Huh?! Daichi!

278
00:17:33,325 --> 00:17:34,923
Hey, Michimiya... What's up?

279
00:17:36,015 --> 00:17:39,925
Are you guys really playing
Seijoh tomorrow? That's so weird.

280
00:17:41,022 --> 00:17:43,897
Yeah, Takeda really worked hard to get that matchup.

281
00:17:44,283 --> 00:17:45,511
Aren't you nervous?

282
00:17:45,536 --> 00:17:45,989
Huh?

283
00:17:46,014 --> 00:17:49,634
It's just that those guys were in the
top 4 in the whole prefecture last year...

284
00:17:49,793 --> 00:17:52,028
Don't you think they'll wipe the floor with you?

285
00:17:53,855 --> 00:17:57,190
You just think that because you haven't
seen these crazy first-years we've got.

286
00:17:57,362 --> 00:17:58,933
Hm? Oh, I heard!

287
00:17:59,512 --> 00:18:02,062
They're the ones who knocked the vice
principal's toupee off his head the first d-.

288
00:18:02,087 --> 00:18:04,475
Ahhh shushushushushush!

289
00:18:04,923 --> 00:18:06,774
Ssh!

290
00:18:08,915 --> 00:18:10,650
They still have a lot of work to do...

291
00:18:11,513 --> 00:18:17,273
But if they keep trying... I really believe Karasuno
High's gonna have the perfect volleyball team one day.

292
00:18:17,698 --> 00:18:18,780
Ohhh.

293
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:22,250
Are first-years allowed in the club room?

294
00:18:22,275 --> 00:18:23,862
Sure, why wouldn't they be?

295
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:26,668
Good afternoon!

296
00:18:27,383 --> 00:18:28,286
Hey-

297
00:18:28,311 --> 00:18:28,925
Dudes.

298
00:18:29,072 --> 00:18:30,337
Hey guys.

299
00:18:32,548 --> 00:18:36,535
Yeah, it's not that amazing,
Hinata... It's just a club room. Okay?

300
00:18:36,785 --> 00:18:39,926
But I've never had a chance to be in one before! Uh!

301
00:18:40,322 --> 00:18:43,051
And I bet this the same one used by the tiny giant.

302
00:18:43,909 --> 00:18:46,737
You must be excited about your debut game tomorrow.

303
00:18:47,587 --> 00:18:50,134
Well.. Practice game, but who's to judge!

304
00:18:51,061 --> 00:18:56,476
Seijoh's gym is freakin' huge! And their guys are
just as big, so don't freak out when you see 'em.

305
00:18:56,818 --> 00:18:57,377
What's up?

306
00:18:57,506 --> 00:18:58,212
Hey.

307
00:18:58,957 --> 00:18:59,998
Boss!

308
00:19:00,277 --> 00:19:00,841
No!

309
00:19:01,044 --> 00:19:01,571
No?

310
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:03,891
I am not going to freak out, okay?!

311
00:19:04,014 --> 00:19:05,854
I'm gonna play my best game ever!

312
00:19:06,267 --> 00:19:10,865
Uh, dude... You do know your jacket
doesn't belong on your legs, right?

313
00:19:13,983 --> 00:19:17,341
Kageyama... can he survive tomorrow?

314
00:19:17,507 --> 00:19:19,103
Hm? Well, what do you mean?

315
00:19:20,535 --> 00:19:24,152
The only game experience he's got is
that one tournament in middle school.

316
00:19:25,031 --> 00:19:28,229
He must be panicking and obsessing pretty bad over this.

317
00:19:28,262 --> 00:19:29,304
I did it on purpose, I swear!

318
00:19:29,329 --> 00:19:30,562
I'm kinda worried...

319
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:32,137
I hope he'll be okay.

320
00:19:33,097 --> 00:19:34,954
But everybody gets nervous once in a while.

321
00:19:34,979 --> 00:19:39,641
Shame on you! You shouldn't pick on the poor guy just
because he has a little case of the first-time jitters!

322
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:40,408
Huh?!

323
00:19:40,998 --> 00:19:43,992
Anything I say to him turns into more pressure.

324
00:19:44,709 --> 00:19:46,897
Hinata... the club room key.

325
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:48,908
Y-yeah sure, I can take it, no problem!

326
00:19:48,933 --> 00:19:51,599
No, I just wanted to show you where we keep it.

327
00:19:51,624 --> 00:19:55,087
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

328
00:19:55,112 --> 00:19:57,836
Well, what do you expect right before his big debut?

329
00:20:01,234 --> 00:20:03,186
Yeah, it's probably best to leave him alone.

330
00:20:03,824 --> 00:20:04,718
Probably.

331
00:20:07,468 --> 00:20:09,575
I have to be on top of it tomorrow!

332
00:20:09,795 --> 00:20:13,838
It's not middle school or the
3-on-3 game anymore. If I suck...

333
00:20:15,076 --> 00:20:16,591
They'll just replace me!

334
00:20:17,317 --> 00:20:20,542
Agh, no! I can't get swapped out!

335
00:20:20,952 --> 00:20:24,120
I get to stand in the court with
some big-time volleyball players!

336
00:20:24,986 --> 00:20:27,005
I want to stay in for the whole game!

337
00:20:32,135 --> 00:20:37,506
I can't mess this up.. I can't mess this up... I
can't mess this up... I can't mess this... Au!

338
00:20:37,531 --> 00:20:40,958
Oh, I'm sorry, you're just so
short, I didn't see you there.

339
00:20:42,832 --> 00:20:44,486
Oh... yeah.

340
00:20:44,874 --> 00:20:45,377
Uh?

341
00:20:45,401 --> 00:20:50,894
I can't mess this up... I can't
mess this up... I can't mess this up...

342
00:20:50,919 --> 00:20:52,005
What's with him?

343
00:20:52,153 --> 00:20:53,029
Beats me.

344
00:20:54,425 --> 00:20:59,788
By the way... could you do us all a favor and take a
break from messing with Hinata? You're pressuring him.

345
00:21:01,407 --> 00:21:02,753
Messing with him?

346
00:21:04,726 --> 00:21:06,202
When have I ever messed with him?

347
00:21:07,854 --> 00:21:09,546
I think I'd remember that.

348
00:21:12,035 --> 00:21:13,178
He doesn't know...

349
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:16,357
Hinata!

350
00:21:16,691 --> 00:21:18,893
Are you wearing my uniform pants, you little doofus?!

351
00:21:18,918 --> 00:21:19,393
Huh?

352
00:21:20,413 --> 00:21:22,920
Tanaka, you pervert, put some pants on!

353
00:21:22,945 --> 00:21:23,587
Huh?!

354
00:21:23,956 --> 00:21:25,742
God, you are such a creep!

355
00:21:26,931 --> 00:21:27,747
Hm?

356
00:21:36,487 --> 00:21:38,075
Darn iiiiiit!

357
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:42,356
I can't sleep! But I gotta get some
rest before the game tomorrowwwwww!

358
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:44,224
What do I dooo-.

359
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:45,807
Shut up, Shoyo!

360
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,063
Uh, sorry...

361
00:22:04,874 --> 00:22:05,638
Ready?

362
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,075
Ready!

363
00:22:07,691 --> 00:22:08,712
Good!

364
00:22:12,366 --> 00:22:14,422
Hey, Hinata, you should have a little snack!

365
00:22:14,531 --> 00:22:17,783
Whoa! You don't look so good, pal!

366
00:22:18,097 --> 00:22:22,224
Huh? Oh no, I'm fine, I just
didn't sleep much last night...

367
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:26,688
Sorry... do you... mind if I open the wi-.

368
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:32,711
Stop the bus! Stop the bus right now!

369
00:22:34,491 --> 00:22:35,247
Did he...

370
00:22:35,973 --> 00:22:36,496
Uh-huh...

371
00:22:36,939 --> 00:22:38,124
We're in trouble.

372
00:22:40,952 --> 00:22:42,371
Oh no...

373
00:24:14,633 --> 00:24:16,100
Is he gonna be okay, Daichi?

374
00:24:16,612 --> 00:24:17,892
Uh, yeah...

375
00:24:17,917 --> 00:24:19,345
Wow, you don't look too hot.

376
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:21,814
Yeah, I think the smell is making me sick too...

377
00:24:21,839 --> 00:24:24,071
Oh god, open all the windows, now!

378
00:24:24,427 --> 00:24:26,801
Next Haikyu! "An interesting team."

379
00:24:31,664 --> 00:24:33,666
Oh god, open all the windows, now!

380
00:24:33,767 --> 00:24:37,036
Next Haikyu! "An interesting team."
