1
00:00:02,848 --> 00:00:03,781
Chance ball!

2
00:00:10,691 --> 00:00:11,843
Aw, yeah!

3
00:00:11,857 --> 00:00:13,597
That's it, buddy! Nice job!

4
00:00:13,623 --> 00:00:15,216
Alright, nice kill!

5
00:00:15,902 --> 00:00:17,876
You're up, Tsukki! Go for it!

6
00:00:20,012 --> 00:00:24,024
You know, if they keep this back‐and‐forth
momentum going like it is for a little while longer,

7
00:00:24,049 --> 00:00:26,703
then I'm thinking Karasuno'll probably take the first set.

8
00:00:27,506 --> 00:00:29,250
But for them to get a solid lead...

9
00:00:30,687 --> 00:00:31,346
There you go!

10
00:00:31,373 --> 00:00:32,760
Oh man, nice one‐touch!

11
00:00:32,793 --> 00:00:34,303
Counter! Now!

12
00:00:34,328 --> 00:00:35,119
Chance ball!

13
00:00:35,982 --> 00:00:36,684
C quick?

14
00:00:36,962 --> 00:00:38,175
Not today!

15
00:00:39,548 --> 00:00:43,834
Whoa... That's two blockers on
Hinata's and Kageyama's attack.

16
00:00:43,859 --> 00:00:47,093
Guess this is a first for us,
isn't it? I can't say I like it.

17
00:00:51,841 --> 00:00:56,717
No way... It's come down to set
point for us against Date Tech?

18
00:02:33,438 --> 00:02:35,034
Hey! Not too bad!

19
00:02:35,059 --> 00:02:36,850
Karasuno is totally crushing it!

20
00:02:37,503 --> 00:02:38,716
Give it here!

21
00:02:49,072 --> 00:02:50,604
Yeah!

22
00:02:58,343 --> 00:03:01,181
Whoa! Karasuno just won the set.

23
00:03:01,787 --> 00:03:04,855
So Karasuno's a real threat once they get in the groove...

24
00:03:05,219 --> 00:03:08,349
You don't think they'll be able to
snap up the second set, too, do you?

25
00:03:09,517 --> 00:03:10,159
Hmm...

26
00:03:10,359 --> 00:03:14,823
I can't say for certain, but I know we won't
see the same developments that we saw in set one.

27
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:19,619
Date Tech, specifically that massive Number 7 fellow,

28
00:03:19,717 --> 00:03:23,636
is still reeling from the shock
of Karasuno's special quick attack.

29
00:03:24,089 --> 00:03:25,950
That really tall Number 7 guy...

30
00:03:26,224 --> 00:03:31,618
And their Number 6 down there at the end... both of
them were able to actually get a hand on the combo attack.

31
00:03:31,746 --> 00:03:33,393
Yeah, they're pretty tough, huh?

32
00:03:34,529 --> 00:03:38,932
The best thing we have going for us right
now is our dynamic duo and that move of theirs.

33
00:03:39,507 --> 00:03:42,249
We can't have it put in a box like when we played Nekoma.

34
00:03:44,161 --> 00:03:47,618
For the second set, we're gonna
begin the rotation two places ahead.

35
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:50,368
In set one...

36
00:03:51,396 --> 00:03:56,416
Hinata was matched up with No‐Brows Number 7,
so I think it's better to avoid that this time.

37
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:59,090
That's why we'll start two positions up.

38
00:03:59,517 --> 00:04:00,523
That makes sense.

39
00:04:00,802 --> 00:04:05,604
That way, Number 7 won't be able to mark
Hinata as closely as he did the first time.

40
00:04:06,021 --> 00:04:07,321
Smart thinking, Coach!

41
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:14,421
Obviously, he's not going to be completely unmarked.
All this will do keep the two of them separated.

42
00:04:14,696 --> 00:04:18,255
Besides... If Hinata's less marked during this game,

43
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:21,695
then it stands to reason that the rest
of you are gonna be covered even more.

44
00:04:22,498 --> 00:04:24,385
We can't always just lean on Hinata.

45
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,390
Keeping him in constant play, keeps us open.

46
00:04:29,076 --> 00:04:32,349
As ace... I promise I'll do what it takes.

47
00:04:33,984 --> 00:04:35,810
That sounded so badass!

48
00:04:35,835 --> 00:04:37,619
He's growing up before our eyes.

49
00:04:37,721 --> 00:04:39,107
Thanks, dad...

50
00:04:39,316 --> 00:04:40,110
Me too!

51
00:04:40,512 --> 00:04:41,212
Well...

52
00:04:41,817 --> 00:04:46,389
I uh... I can't really do back
attacks like you can, Asahi, so...

53
00:04:46,671 --> 00:04:49,039
I'll make as many points as I can from the front!

54
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:52,017
And I'll be the greatest decoy you've ever seen!

55
00:04:54,213 --> 00:04:55,571
Good. Thank you...

56
00:04:55,871 --> 00:04:57,544
You can definitely count on me!

57
00:04:59,010 --> 00:04:59,717
Sure!

58
00:05:00,621 --> 00:05:04,206
Go, go, Date Tech, Date Tech, here we go!

59
00:05:05,968 --> 00:05:07,643
It's time to start set two.

60
00:05:08,893 --> 00:05:10,764
I'm sorry about that, Tsukishima.

61
00:05:11,543 --> 00:05:15,825
With the new matchups, you'll be
opposite their Number 7 a whole lot.

62
00:05:16,012 --> 00:05:19,584
It's alright... I mean, c'mon let's be honest about this.

63
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:23,161
Nobody's expecting me to score the
game‐winning point on that guy, you know?

64
00:05:23,301 --> 00:05:25,725
It's Hinata's job to deal out the real damage...

65
00:05:26,485 --> 00:05:27,326
Think about it.

66
00:05:27,473 --> 00:05:32,325
From my position, all I'm supposed to be
responsible for is holding down the fort the best I can.

67
00:05:32,911 --> 00:05:35,282
It's no different than any other game, really.

68
00:05:35,995 --> 00:05:42,002
And face it, putting all that aside... it's pretty clear
that their blockers have already locked onto you, anyway.

69
00:05:44,796 --> 00:05:46,067
Alright, let's go!

70
00:05:47,682 --> 00:05:48,343
Nice receive!

71
00:05:48,368 --> 00:05:52,316
Looks like Karasuno switched up the
rotation... and I think I know why.

72
00:05:52,609 --> 00:05:55,164
It's to try and keep Aone away from their Number 10.

73
00:05:59,301 --> 00:06:04,071
Listen, no matter what the matchup is... we
need to focus on shutting that spiker down.

74
00:06:04,602 --> 00:06:08,434
Listen Aone, I know we have a tendency
to be snotty when we're out of uniform...

75
00:06:08,667 --> 00:06:11,471
But while we're on the court,
we should be good underclassmen.

76
00:06:14,156 --> 00:06:15,127
Kageyama!

77
00:06:22,592 --> 00:06:25,820
Hinata had him on the hook, but then he went left.

78
00:06:31,004 --> 00:06:32,783
Yeah, Tanaka!

79
00:06:32,808 --> 00:06:33,513
Nice one!

80
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:34,521
I'm open!

81
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:35,947
Watch Number 3!

82
00:06:39,395 --> 00:06:43,622
That only happened because was specifically
focusing on the guy with the man‐bun.

83
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:48,562
He won't be able to do that with the receives
all over the place. Leave that to short stuff.

84
00:06:48,769 --> 00:06:49,724
Nice, Aone!

85
00:06:49,848 --> 00:06:52,279
Yeah! Let's do that again next time!

86
00:06:54,493 --> 00:06:56,599
Great job, Daichi!

87
00:07:01,699 --> 00:07:04,078
Karasuno Number 10's in the front row now.

88
00:07:06,744 --> 00:07:09,118
There it goes! Cover it, Kageyama!

89
00:07:10,292 --> 00:07:11,225
Bring it here!

90
00:07:14,692 --> 00:07:18,874
I don't believe it, he's even faster when
he's right in front of you. He's a monster!

91
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,347
After they changed the rotation...

92
00:07:32,806 --> 00:07:37,497
Iit kind of seemed like it brought in new life into
that special technique of theirs somehow, didn't it?

93
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:42,306
Whatever effect it had will wear off
as time goes by... If Date wins this set.

94
00:07:42,706 --> 00:07:45,798
And manages to keep the same momentum into a third set...

95
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,100
Karasuno loses the advantage...

96
00:07:48,411 --> 00:07:51,507
It's all gonna depend on how
well they can hold their own against

97
00:07:51,532 --> 00:07:54,687
Date Tech's Number 7 without
their Number 10 on the front row.

98
00:07:55,324 --> 00:08:01,498
Whether or not they can beat the iron wall, comes
down to how much they rely on that little decoy of theirs.

99
00:08:03,624 --> 00:08:05,017
All yours, Hinata!

100
00:08:05,123 --> 00:08:08,058
Everyone's talking about that Number 10's quick attack!

101
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:08,892
Which guy?

102
00:08:08,996 --> 00:08:10,656
He's in the back row right now.

103
00:08:11,647 --> 00:08:12,646
Great work, guys!

104
00:08:12,671 --> 00:08:16,514
Tsukishima. I've been thinking about what
you were saying before the game started...

105
00:08:16,743 --> 00:08:20,388
About how it's your job to hold down
the fort while Hinata's in the front row...

106
00:08:21,048 --> 00:08:25,265
Pulling that off against a team as
tough as this... that's really impressive.

107
00:08:25,768 --> 00:08:31,180
The way things are, those two aren't just important
to our offense... they're fundamental players.

108
00:08:31,413 --> 00:08:35,637
But we have to survive the moments when
we can't use their attack... That's crucial.

109
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:41,804
It's like when you receive, to set up a
spike, even if you can't make the hit yourself.

110
00:08:42,092 --> 00:08:47,154
Right now... whether or not we hold
down the fort... that decides our fate.

111
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:53,720
Cover me, would ya?

112
00:08:53,793 --> 00:08:54,317
Got it!

113
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:57,612
When the going gets tough, the ace gets the set.

114
00:08:58,196 --> 00:08:58,796
Open!

115
00:08:58,821 --> 00:08:59,620
Asahi!

116
00:09:00,812 --> 00:09:01,638
Watch the left!

117
00:09:02,069 --> 00:09:03,948
All the walls in the world...

118
00:09:07,227 --> 00:09:08,765
won't stop me!

119
00:09:11,876 --> 00:09:15,230
AAAAAAAAH!

120
00:09:19,242 --> 00:09:21,452
I can see why they're so famous for blocking.

121
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:25,233
Number 10 is just the middle
blocker, but he seems like the ace.

122
00:09:27,512 --> 00:09:30,900
Number 7's block is the driving
force behind the iron wall.

123
00:09:31,694 --> 00:09:33,950
They need him in the front
row quick or they're in trouble.

124
00:09:33,975 --> 00:09:34,868
Let's keep it up!

125
00:09:35,979 --> 00:09:36,871
Yeah!

126
00:09:37,392 --> 00:09:40,953
How much more can you take... ace of Karasuno?

127
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,112
Nice receive, boss!

128
00:09:48,137 --> 00:09:48,720
Open!

129
00:09:48,986 --> 00:09:49,950
Number Three!

130
00:09:51,607 --> 00:09:53,694
You won't break me again!

131
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,684
One touch!

132
00:09:56,897 --> 00:09:58,074
Counter!

133
00:09:58,099 --> 00:10:00,239
Hey... don't be getting cocky!

134
00:10:02,103 --> 00:10:03,545
We've got our own wall!

135
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:08,003
Yeah! Those guys just shut down a quick attack!

136
00:10:08,517 --> 00:10:12,599
So it looks like Number 3 and Number 11
are the tallest guys on Karasuno's team.

137
00:10:12,819 --> 00:10:15,076
Yeah! That's a block point!

138
00:10:15,316 --> 00:10:20,715
Sweet! And now, if Date Tech gets the
next point... Number 7 moves back to the rear!

139
00:10:21,756 --> 00:10:22,631
Shake it off!

140
00:10:22,656 --> 00:10:23,371
You ready?

141
00:10:23,902 --> 00:10:24,753
Okay!

142
00:10:25,026 --> 00:10:26,526
Now let's widen the gap!

143
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:31,014
Booyah! Uh‐oh, Karasuno Number 10's in the front now!

144
00:10:31,325 --> 00:10:32,593
Let's go!

145
00:10:33,131 --> 00:10:34,864
Just six more points...

146
00:10:35,623 --> 00:10:38,271
Wreck 'em as much as you can
while you're up front, little man!

147
00:10:41,086 --> 00:10:42,009
Number 12!

148
00:10:43,888 --> 00:10:45,232
Kageyama! Cover it!

149
00:10:45,891 --> 00:10:46,409
Here!

150
00:10:46,473 --> 00:10:47,533
Bring it to me!

151
00:10:49,635 --> 00:10:51,135
He's really something, huh?

152
00:10:51,712 --> 00:10:56,371
He just goes running straight in for a quick
attack where you'd normally use the left side guy.

153
00:10:56,504 --> 00:10:57,164
Bam!

154
00:10:58,441 --> 00:11:01,293
Yeah! That'll cut you down to size!

155
00:11:01,318 --> 00:11:02,409
Nice, Kamacchi!

156
00:11:04,926 --> 00:11:07,699
Agh! We can't get a solid lead!

157
00:11:07,892 --> 00:11:10,738
Just be patient... We'll get there.

158
00:11:12,418 --> 00:11:13,663
Nice one, Asahi!

159
00:11:13,688 --> 00:11:14,916
That's a chance ball!

160
00:11:14,941 --> 00:11:15,985
Give it here!

161
00:11:18,757 --> 00:11:19,590
Dammit...!

162
00:11:22,003 --> 00:11:23,349
Awesome kill!

163
00:11:23,374 --> 00:11:24,649
Keep going!

164
00:11:24,987 --> 00:11:26,900
Just one more point to match point!

165
00:11:27,148 --> 00:11:28,901
You're so close, guys!

166
00:11:29,338 --> 00:11:30,198
Nice receive!

167
00:11:30,376 --> 00:11:36,405
Perfect... That giant Date Tech blocker's in the
back, now... and Shorty's still positioned in the front...

168
00:11:37,435 --> 00:11:39,469
Now they can widen the lead!

169
00:11:40,024 --> 00:11:41,128
Kamasaki...

170
00:11:42,015 --> 00:11:45,293
You hiding behind Aone to let him get all
the glory or do you want him to carry you?

171
00:11:45,318 --> 00:11:46,027
Huh?!

172
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:49,277
Screw you, dude! Takes more
than him to make the iron wall!

173
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:52,665
Got that?!

174
00:11:54,997 --> 00:11:57,464
Yeah!

175
00:11:58,982 --> 00:11:59,832
Try again.

176
00:12:00,067 --> 00:12:00,725
Yeah.

177
00:12:01,038 --> 00:12:03,638
Number 7's coming back to the front row.

178
00:12:05,531 --> 00:12:06,398
We're good.

179
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:08,711
We've still got our freak quick‐attack.

180
00:12:09,924 --> 00:12:10,445
But...

181
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:13,710
Nishinoya!

182
00:12:14,697 --> 00:12:15,854
Bring it on!

183
00:12:21,087 --> 00:12:22,964
Waterfall ball... Close one.

184
00:12:23,215 --> 00:12:24,987
Yeah, but it's still match point!

185
00:12:27,003 --> 00:12:28,577
Go for the point!

186
00:12:28,903 --> 00:12:30,449
Alright!

187
00:12:31,203 --> 00:12:34,637
Hey, Don't you sweat it, Aone,
we're just getting started...

188
00:12:34,896 --> 00:12:36,530
You can stop the next one!

189
00:12:39,343 --> 00:12:41,219
It's match point for Karasuno now.

190
00:12:41,688 --> 00:12:43,550
Their Number 10's on the back row now.

191
00:12:45,596 --> 00:12:48,424
This is gonna be their strongest turn for blocking us.

192
00:12:49,992 --> 00:12:50,979
Serve's up!

193
00:12:56,097 --> 00:12:57,904
I'm so sorry guys, I really am!

194
00:12:57,929 --> 00:12:58,409
It's fine.

195
00:12:58,902 --> 00:13:02,749
It happens to everybody, all you can do is
regret it for a second and then let it go!

196
00:13:03,302 --> 00:13:03,942
Sir!

197
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:07,400
If Date Tech gets two more points, it'll be deuce.

198
00:13:07,696 --> 00:13:10,420
And with this rotation, that could happen very easily.

199
00:13:10,743 --> 00:13:15,465
Yeah, well, Karasuno better hope that doesn't happen
right now, what with Number 10 being out and everything.

200
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:17,227
Shake it off! You're good!

201
00:13:17,603 --> 00:13:19,522
Man, their Number 7's intimidating.

202
00:13:19,857 --> 00:13:20,563
Yeah...

203
00:13:20,743 --> 00:13:22,917
I could've sworn he had that one...

204
00:13:23,433 --> 00:13:27,401
But hey... he's gonna have a real hard
time with Asahi in the front row, right?

205
00:13:28,496 --> 00:13:29,223
Asahi!

206
00:13:30,318 --> 00:13:31,198
Asahi...

207
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:34,982
Our ace is out there... It's okay!

208
00:13:53,376 --> 00:13:54,264
Right here!

209
00:13:56,212 --> 00:13:56,663
Nice recive!

210
00:13:56,687 --> 00:13:57,526
Watch for that quick!

211
00:13:57,551 --> 00:14:00,641
So this is a good arrangement,
but Date's watching extra close now.

212
00:14:03,207 --> 00:14:04,064
Asahi, here!

213
00:14:04,089 --> 00:14:04,731
Got it!

214
00:14:05,529 --> 00:14:08,203
I'm no ace if I can't make the last ball count!

215
00:14:08,364 --> 00:14:13,880
We shut this guy down once, so if we can't do it
again, then we have no right to say we're the Iron Wall!

216
00:14:14,317 --> 00:14:15,810
Nice block, Moniwa!

217
00:14:17,471 --> 00:14:19,113
Crap! The back's wide open!

218
00:14:23,969 --> 00:14:25,092
He got it!

219
00:14:25,158 --> 00:14:26,218
Hey, cover!

220
00:14:27,007 --> 00:14:30,979
Every ball is an opportunity! Left side! One more!

221
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:32,445
Asahi!

222
00:14:33,495 --> 00:14:34,909
That's a little close to the net?!

223
00:14:37,398 --> 00:14:38,496
A joust!

224
00:14:38,705 --> 00:14:40,224
Let's see who's got the strength!

225
00:14:58,478 --> 00:14:59,665
I can't make it...

226
00:15:08,692 --> 00:15:09,587
His foot?!

227
00:15:10,611 --> 00:15:11,525
No way...

228
00:15:12,164 --> 00:15:13,091
Did he just...?!

229
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:14,588
One more time!

230
00:15:14,652 --> 00:15:16,479
Yeah, nice follow‐through!

231
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:19,291
Get back... get back, now!

232
00:15:19,878 --> 00:15:22,419
Get a running start and jump as high as you can!

233
00:15:22,824 --> 00:15:26,398
Keep doing it as many times as
you have to, just make this count!

234
00:15:27,005 --> 00:15:33,318
Stay focused and don't stop moving! If you stop wanting
it for even a second, the ball's gonna hit the floor!

235
00:15:33,713 --> 00:15:35,024
Kageyama, cover!

236
00:15:35,049 --> 00:15:35,557
On it!

237
00:15:36,292 --> 00:15:37,252
One more time!

238
00:15:37,626 --> 00:15:39,134
One more time!

239
00:15:39,433 --> 00:15:41,045
Until I can score!

240
00:15:43,601 --> 00:15:46,187
Asahi's favorite toss is slightly in front of the net.

241
00:15:46,933 --> 00:15:48,273
A medium‐high set.

242
00:15:50,137 --> 00:15:50,870
Uh‐oh...

243
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,617
Why would he do that?!

244
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:54,923
It's fine.

245
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:58,393
This is the best chance we have... Trust me.

246
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,085
Yeah, do it, Asahi!

247
00:16:03,354 --> 00:16:04,509
Clear that wall!

248
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,788
GOOOO!

249
00:16:05,813 --> 00:16:07,099
GOOOO!

250
00:16:07,124 --> 00:16:08,910
GOOOO!

251
00:16:53,453 --> 00:16:55,680
YEAAAAAAAAH!

252
00:17:00,067 --> 00:17:00,640
Got 'em!

253
00:17:00,665 --> 00:17:01,763
Yeah!

254
00:17:03,091 --> 00:17:05,215
I knew you guys could win!

255
00:17:05,879 --> 00:17:07,315
Let's line up, guys.

256
00:17:09,689 --> 00:17:11,135
Thank you for the game!

257
00:17:32,286 --> 00:17:33,619
You did it, Asahi!

258
00:17:33,706 --> 00:17:35,070
That was nuts!

259
00:17:35,106 --> 00:17:41,784
First Date's block was like bam! And then, they
were all wuwuwuwu! If it was me, I'd go fwoosh!

260
00:17:41,809 --> 00:17:43,319
Use your words, Hinata.

261
00:17:45,999 --> 00:17:49,920
If I'm this team's ace, you guys are the heroes.

262
00:17:52,513 --> 00:17:53,820
Heroes!

263
00:17:54,693 --> 00:17:56,524
Oh yeah, I like the sound of that!

264
00:18:01,376 --> 00:18:05,816
Look, despite that insane quick attack of
theirs, you did really good out there today, Aone...

265
00:18:06,074 --> 00:18:06,465
They just...

266
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:07,317
Nationals!

267
00:18:07,813 --> 00:18:09,146
He is right, Moniwa!

268
00:18:09,569 --> 00:18:12,497
We are just gonna have to get our
revenge in the spring preliminaries!

269
00:18:13,064 --> 00:18:15,861
Prelims are in September, so let's head home, make a plan,

270
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:18,855
and get ready to crush Karasuno if
we get matched with them at Nationals.

271
00:18:18,935 --> 00:18:21,366
But the third‐years will be long gone by then.

272
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:26,684
Oh I get it, so you don't think
we're worth waiting around for, huh?!

273
00:18:26,962 --> 00:18:33,036
Huh?! What are you talking about?! We've discussed this
before, you two! Third‐years are done after Inter‐High!

274
00:18:34,133 --> 00:18:34,888
Yeah, but...

275
00:18:35,619 --> 00:18:37,092
You guys will be fine.

276
00:18:38,929 --> 00:18:43,550
Our school's known for being a serious
contender... but that excludes us third‐years.

277
00:18:43,686 --> 00:18:45,925
Let's face it, we're the chaff of the team.

278
00:18:46,836 --> 00:18:51,881
It's only thanks to you guys that we've been
able to keep up our reputation as the Iron Wall.

279
00:18:53,389 --> 00:18:56,420
When Nationals come next year, you have to stay!

280
00:18:57,230 --> 00:19:02,602
Start preparing for it right now with a brand new
team, and if you can't win this year, win next year!

281
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:09,413
Whether it's Seijoh or Karasuno or Shiratorizawa,
take down everyone in your path and make it to Nationals!

282
00:19:09,999 --> 00:19:10,453
But...

283
00:19:10,478 --> 00:19:11,577
Understand?!

284
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:14,661
Sir...

285
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,318
Hey, you need to speak up, Futakuchi!

286
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:21,717
Sir!

287
00:19:23,701 --> 00:19:25,516
Great work out there, you three!

288
00:19:26,865 --> 00:19:28,412
Congratulations!

289
00:19:28,884 --> 00:19:29,857
Oh, hey there...

290
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,477
I didn't know you ladies came out to support us, thanks.

291
00:19:32,502 --> 00:19:34,468
You honestly had no idea they were here?

292
00:19:34,722 --> 00:19:36,019
There's our girl!

293
00:19:36,899 --> 00:19:38,718
Glad you got your revenge.

294
00:19:44,381 --> 00:19:46,835
Right! And we'll win again!

295
00:19:47,902 --> 00:19:49,642
Um, hey Coach?

296
00:19:49,729 --> 00:19:50,101
Hm?

297
00:19:50,651 --> 00:19:51,612
That last set...

298
00:19:52,285 --> 00:19:55,029
What exactly did you mean when
you said that it was our best one?

299
00:19:56,377 --> 00:20:00,021
Well when the receives are crazy and you
can't do the kind of attack you want to do.

300
00:20:00,592 --> 00:20:05,028
The last ball ends up left... It'll always
go to the position where the ace is waiting.

301
00:20:05,879 --> 00:20:08,417
In a critical moment like that,
I wanted Asahi to see how it

302
00:20:08,441 --> 00:20:13,083
feels to rip a point out of that
Iron Wall with his own two hands.

303
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:15,630
Oh, I see.

304
00:20:16,142 --> 00:20:18,595
I'm sure it boosts his confidence for the next play.

305
00:20:19,495 --> 00:20:24,705
Well, I heard something about Asahi getting his
man‐bun in a bunch after Date Tech handed his ass to him.

306
00:20:25,296 --> 00:20:27,204
But I think this helped him get over it.

307
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:31,598
He really held his own against that
Iron Wall, with or without a decoy.

308
00:20:32,417 --> 00:20:37,820
Besides... for a spiker, there's a certain amount
of pride to be taken in having the ball sent to him.

309
00:20:39,441 --> 00:20:43,131
It's proof of how much your setter
trusts you when all the chips are down.

310
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:49,453
In his case, he's got two setters who believe
in him... so how could he not be confident?

311
00:20:51,627 --> 00:20:54,660
I've never seen a block as intimidating as Date Tech's.

312
00:20:54,685 --> 00:20:55,431
Me neither.

313
00:20:56,844 --> 00:21:00,282
So have you figured out how the two
Karasuno first‐years have been able

314
00:21:00,307 --> 00:21:03,271
to differentiate between their
normal and their super‐quick attacks?

315
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:06,190
I couldn't make out any signals during the rally.

316
00:21:06,629 --> 00:21:07,260
Yeah.

317
00:21:09,133 --> 00:21:12,115
That's good. They couldn't read our signals!

318
00:21:12,277 --> 00:21:14,697
Uh‐huh... I guess we should keep 'em then.

319
00:21:15,409 --> 00:21:19,655
Couple of lunkheads like you managed to put
it all together, I must say, I'm impressed.

320
00:21:20,188 --> 00:21:22,201
For your information, it wasn't us!

321
00:21:22,226 --> 00:21:25,418
Of course not. So who did it for you then?

322
00:21:26,417 --> 00:21:27,415
Sugawara.

323
00:21:29,882 --> 00:21:32,724
Congratulations, Captain. You got your revenge.

324
00:21:33,836 --> 00:21:34,444
Yeah.

325
00:21:34,904 --> 00:21:35,664
Even so...

326
00:21:37,609 --> 00:21:39,911
I would have preferred to beat them with my sets though.

327
00:21:43,317 --> 00:21:46,806
Ah! I‐I'm sorry! Uh... Let's just keep that between us.

328
00:21:47,677 --> 00:21:48,687
I'm glad to hear it.

329
00:21:50,532 --> 00:21:53,758
I'm glad you're still keeping yourself
involved with the game. That's good.

330
00:21:55,395 --> 00:21:57,597
Let's be ready to win again tomorrow.

331
00:21:58,816 --> 00:21:59,386
Yeah!

332
00:22:04,807 --> 00:22:09,116
Goooo, Seijoh! Go, Seijoh!

333
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:11,022
Aoba‐Johsai won.

334
00:22:11,171 --> 00:22:12,524
That's not good.

335
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:16,906
The King... and his little, dark horse.

336
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:21,387
Once we chew you up and spit you out, we can go on home.

337
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,573
We'll be at nationals.

338
00:23:58,897 --> 00:24:01,645
He thinks he's all that just 'cause he has fangirls.

339
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:03,417
Yeah, we've still got Kiyoko...

340
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:04,587
Hey Oikawa!

341
00:24:04,624 --> 00:24:06,415
What?! How could you?!

342
00:24:06,658 --> 00:24:07,312
Kidding.

343
00:24:07,337 --> 00:24:08,130
Kiyoko...

344
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:09,917
Don't scare us like that!

345
00:24:10,513 --> 00:24:12,593
Next Haikyu!! "The Conductor."
