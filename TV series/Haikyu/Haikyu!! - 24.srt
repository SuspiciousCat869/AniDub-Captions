1
00:00:10,793 --> 00:00:12,404
A one-handed set?!

2
00:00:29,197 --> 00:00:31,398
They got got it! They tied it back up!

3
00:00:32,013 --> 00:00:33,691
So what is this called again?

4
00:00:33,991 --> 00:00:34,884
It's a deuce!

5
00:00:36,903 --> 00:00:40,098
The first team to score two points... wins!

6
00:02:16,714 --> 00:02:21,892
Ohhhh-oh-OOOOOOH! Sei-joh!

7
00:02:21,917 --> 00:02:23,179
Seijoh!

8
00:02:23,204 --> 00:02:27,984
Ohhhh-oh-OOOOOOH! Sei-joh!

9
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,623
Seijoh!

10
00:02:30,074 --> 00:02:34,109
Ohhhh-oh-OOOOOOH! Sei-joh!

11
00:02:34,134 --> 00:02:36,237
Time to get out there and finish this!

12
00:02:36,262 --> 00:02:36,863
Right!

13
00:02:37,777 --> 00:02:39,440
Kunimi... you ready?

14
00:02:39,486 --> 00:02:39,927
Yep.

15
00:02:40,571 --> 00:02:44,212
Duuude, I am so proud of you badass first-years!

16
00:02:48,846 --> 00:02:52,295
Since when does Kunimi know
how to go after a ball like that?

17
00:02:55,348 --> 00:02:56,749
Don't just let it go!

18
00:03:02,191 --> 00:03:03,011
Kageyama!

19
00:03:04,686 --> 00:03:07,870
Trust me... I'll do the broad
jump as many times as it takes!

20
00:03:09,496 --> 00:03:10,147
Right.

21
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:12,828
You ready?

22
00:03:12,853 --> 00:03:14,151
Yeah!

23
00:03:16,247 --> 00:03:16,769
Tanaka!

24
00:03:16,794 --> 00:03:17,851
We've got the flow now!

25
00:03:17,876 --> 00:03:19,786
Serve up a point, Tanaka!

26
00:03:19,811 --> 00:03:21,270
Yeah you know it, bro!

27
00:03:23,793 --> 00:03:25,029
They're not in position!

28
00:03:25,054 --> 00:03:26,335
Come on, block that!

29
00:03:27,978 --> 00:03:28,915
Chance ball!

30
00:03:34,702 --> 00:03:35,922
It's a chance ball!

31
00:03:36,606 --> 00:03:38,465
Just one more ball!

32
00:03:42,188 --> 00:03:43,843
Good job, Watari!

33
00:03:44,407 --> 00:03:45,843
Number 10 recovers quick!

34
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:49,708
Nice one-touch!

35
00:03:51,474 --> 00:03:53,605
Almost there!

36
00:03:54,358 --> 00:03:55,715
I know you're getting the set.

37
00:03:56,848 --> 00:03:58,916
I'm not gonna leave you unmarked!

38
00:04:03,777 --> 00:04:06,670
He's not jumping as high now! The timing's off!

39
00:04:24,415 --> 00:04:25,716
Hinata!

40
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:27,395
See that?!

41
00:04:27,692 --> 00:04:30,163
Hinata just saved our asses big time!

42
00:04:30,587 --> 00:04:31,620
There we go!

43
00:04:31,994 --> 00:04:33,284
It's time to rush em!

44
00:04:33,309 --> 00:04:34,046
Right!

45
00:04:34,132 --> 00:04:35,659
We've got 'em in check now!

46
00:04:37,025 --> 00:04:39,193
We can still come back... Stay calm!

47
00:04:39,218 --> 00:04:39,995
Sir!

48
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:43,586
Give us another one, Tanaka!

49
00:04:43,785 --> 00:04:44,672
Hanamaki!

50
00:04:44,697 --> 00:04:45,150
Yup!

51
00:04:51,039 --> 00:04:52,674
The score's still the same...

52
00:04:52,699 --> 00:04:54,411
If Seijoh doesn't cause a break...

53
00:04:54,605 --> 00:04:57,002
Karasuno still has the advantage for right now.

54
00:04:58,001 --> 00:04:58,795
That said...

55
00:05:00,075 --> 00:05:03,162
Oikawa's up to serve at the worst possible moment!

56
00:05:08,396 --> 00:05:11,132
I will not let you have control of this game.

57
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:17,657
It's our victory. We have to get to the next round.

58
00:05:18,423 --> 00:05:24,302
I'll beat him... I swear I will!
I'll humiliate that whole team!

59
00:05:30,474 --> 00:05:34,880
This one play will put Seijoh back on top! I know it!

60
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:37,276
Nishinoya!

61
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,628
Good eye Nishi! Well done!

62
00:05:48,778 --> 00:05:49,615
Thanks, man!

63
00:05:51,447 --> 00:05:55,015
Wow, I can't believe Oikawa flubbed a serve.

64
00:05:55,315 --> 00:05:57,270
Match point Karasuno again.

65
00:05:57,484 --> 00:06:00,193
So now their hotshot is messing up his serves...

66
00:06:00,218 --> 00:06:01,849
Maybe he's starting to lose it!

67
00:06:02,396 --> 00:06:04,645
Yeah... even he's not perfect!

68
00:06:07,605 --> 00:06:08,893
The score is even now...

69
00:06:08,918 --> 00:06:11,069
At the end of the day, a point is a point.

70
00:06:11,619 --> 00:06:13,386
Iwaizumi is so cool!

71
00:06:13,526 --> 00:06:15,507
That makes me feel inferior...

72
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:19,017
Oh really? So did you think
you were better than me before?

73
00:06:19,172 --> 00:06:24,689
Depending on the situation, there can be a huge
difference between a break point and a side-out point.

74
00:06:25,078 --> 00:06:28,602
But the team places a lot of
value in what Iwaizumi thinks,

75
00:06:28,627 --> 00:06:32,534
so his words and actions have been
holding the team together since the start.

76
00:06:33,593 --> 00:06:39,744
Wait a second... Did you say Aoba-Johsai's never
been to the Nationals before? They're such a strong team!

77
00:06:39,769 --> 00:06:43,006
Yeah, but they're lagging behind
in the grand scheme of things.

78
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:45,100
Both teams are exhausted physically,

79
00:06:45,287 --> 00:06:47,715
but I bet Seijoh's the most mentally frazzled!

80
00:06:48,169 --> 00:06:49,520
Stay on top of 'em, guys!

81
00:07:21,954 --> 00:07:23,316
Wow!

82
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,775
They're past 30 points now!

83
00:07:26,175 --> 00:07:27,639
Both sides have it rough.

84
00:07:27,871 --> 00:07:28,426
Maybe...

85
00:07:28,786 --> 00:07:31,796
But it seems like Karasuno's
barely keeping the ball in play.

86
00:07:32,096 --> 00:07:34,511
Their attacks feel kind of uninspired.

87
00:07:34,891 --> 00:07:39,232
That said, the psychological pressure
must be far worse on Seijoh's side.

88
00:07:39,694 --> 00:07:42,266
Serve up a good one, Oikawa!

89
00:07:42,633 --> 00:07:44,957
Crap, the rotation's gone full circle!

90
00:07:45,057 --> 00:07:46,073
Serve's up!

91
00:07:46,098 --> 00:07:49,029
I'm sure he's still kicking
himself for the serve he flubbed.

92
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:50,503
Can he handle it?

93
00:07:50,528 --> 00:07:55,716
Oikawa... If you get distracted worrying about
Ushiwaka, you're gonna get punched in the face.

94
00:07:59,763 --> 00:08:02,315
If you're blind to the opponent
that's right in front of you...

95
00:08:02,715 --> 00:08:05,404
then that'll be the last
opponent that you get to challenge.

96
00:08:13,901 --> 00:08:15,394
I couldn't agree more.

97
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,617
One play takes it!

98
00:08:17,642 --> 00:08:18,211
Yeah!

99
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:49,537
Heads up, it's a chance ball!

100
00:08:49,562 --> 00:08:50,377
Right here!

101
00:08:51,048 --> 00:08:55,513
Considering how bad he screwed up the last one,
I think that's the best serve I've seen all day!

102
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:57,498
Sorry, guys!

103
00:08:57,819 --> 00:09:00,518
All that matters is keeping the ball in the air!

104
00:09:00,989 --> 00:09:04,626
Try to stay calm! Don't let a decoy fool you into jumping!

105
00:09:04,737 --> 00:09:08,074
A quick-attack? Or maybe a situation
like this calls for their ace!

106
00:09:08,099 --> 00:09:09,134
Over here!

107
00:09:10,975 --> 00:09:11,875
The other side?!

108
00:09:14,698 --> 00:09:15,822
Him again?!

109
00:09:18,004 --> 00:09:18,717
Kunimi!

110
00:09:19,616 --> 00:09:22,993
They may know you're a decoy...
but you still have to go in!

111
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:27,088
What for? They could obviously
tell the ball was headed left.

112
00:09:27,511 --> 00:09:28,731
Waste of energy.

113
00:09:31,573 --> 00:09:34,615
You're a good player; Why can't you take this seriously?!

114
00:09:36,907 --> 00:09:40,111
What, I'm not serious unless I'm running myself ragged?

115
00:09:44,898 --> 00:09:45,717
Chance ball!

116
00:09:45,742 --> 00:09:46,316
Got it!

117
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:48,224
He's still got energy?!

118
00:09:50,428 --> 00:09:53,020
I saw you slacking on your decoy work, Kunimi.

119
00:09:54,359 --> 00:09:54,919
Sorry, I...

120
00:09:54,944 --> 00:09:59,623
At least be sneaky when you cut corners...
or else Mizoguchi might yell at you again.

121
00:10:00,234 --> 00:10:01,620
HEY! Kunimiiii!

122
00:10:02,053 --> 00:10:06,748
The thing about you, Kunimi, is that you're
efficient, and you never do any more work than necessary.

123
00:10:07,345 --> 00:10:11,760
That said... when the rest of us are too
tired to play... you're going to make up for it.

124
00:10:14,485 --> 00:10:19,901
A good setter ensures all of his teammates are
working at full power... no matter who they are! Right?

125
00:10:21,112 --> 00:10:22,249
13 again?!

126
00:10:25,193 --> 00:10:26,113
A feint!

127
00:10:29,931 --> 00:10:31,102
Seijoh caught up!

128
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:33,761
And now they've got match point again!

129
00:10:33,897 --> 00:10:36,359
Yeah... and it's Oikawa's serve.

130
00:10:38,316 --> 00:10:40,711
We were teammates for 3 whole years.

131
00:10:42,201 --> 00:10:43,328
But until now...

132
00:10:44,994 --> 00:10:48,244
I'd never once seen Kunimi smile during a game.

133
00:10:48,904 --> 00:10:50,581
Listen, I want to tell you something.

134
00:10:51,547 --> 00:10:52,520
Who are you?

135
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,771
Now that I've seen this side of you...

136
00:10:55,004 --> 00:10:57,024
I don't know if I can compete with you.

137
00:10:57,169 --> 00:10:59,423
Kageyama? Hello?

138
00:11:00,183 --> 00:11:02,107
Kageyama! HEY!

139
00:11:03,452 --> 00:11:06,388
Jeez... You're not about to freak out on me, are you?

140
00:11:09,363 --> 00:11:13,726
Listen to me! Obviously a king is gonna be
scared of a great king! It's right there in the name!

141
00:11:13,794 --> 00:11:16,600
I mean the guy even looks way smarter than you do!

142
00:11:16,873 --> 00:11:18,047
Sorry, Kageyama.

143
00:11:19,465 --> 00:11:22,716
But hey... I promise that I'll
get it back to you next time.

144
00:11:23,862 --> 00:11:25,712
Then we'll do what we usually do...

145
00:11:26,058 --> 00:11:28,013
and follow your lead for the attack.

146
00:11:29,782 --> 00:11:34,508
Kageyama! Quit doubting yourself!
What did I tell you before?!

147
00:11:41,999 --> 00:11:43,976
Our guys... are all good.

148
00:11:46,321 --> 00:11:49,288
Sure hope His Highness didn't
get spooked by that other king.

149
00:11:52,329 --> 00:11:53,516
He's gonna be alright...

150
00:11:53,891 --> 00:11:56,992
Kageyama's not the same lonely
king-of-the-court he used to be.

151
00:12:21,334 --> 00:12:23,944
Let's go, go-go-go-go SeiJOH!

152
00:12:24,764 --> 00:12:25,864
GO!

153
00:12:26,593 --> 00:12:28,369
COME OOOOOON!

154
00:12:28,463 --> 00:12:29,729
We're gonna get this one!

155
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:30,789
Yeah!

156
00:12:33,005 --> 00:12:34,428
Ugh... Great.

157
00:12:36,302 --> 00:12:37,907
This is quite a bother...

158
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:39,921
Serve's up!

159
00:12:40,292 --> 00:12:43,902
Tobio... You're evolving so quickly.

160
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:46,875
And I think that might be my downfall.

161
00:12:51,462 --> 00:12:52,009
But...

162
00:12:53,758 --> 00:12:58,041
Oooooooolé!

163
00:12:58,471 --> 00:12:59,021
Front!

164
00:13:02,191 --> 00:13:03,068
It's back up!

165
00:13:03,093 --> 00:13:05,350
They not gonna make it! They're out of formation!

166
00:13:06,213 --> 00:13:11,397
Just when the pressure of the game gets you
on edge, a diversion slips in to trip you up.

167
00:13:12,123 --> 00:13:15,053
They are so focused on ripping the win from our grasp...

168
00:13:15,506 --> 00:13:15,883
Over here!

169
00:13:15,908 --> 00:13:16,913
Center!

170
00:13:17,566 --> 00:13:18,313
Left side!

171
00:13:18,338 --> 00:13:19,784
Asahi, go!

172
00:13:21,726 --> 00:13:22,806
Keep it in play!

173
00:13:24,952 --> 00:13:25,633
It's up...

174
00:13:26,782 --> 00:13:28,288
It's all you, Kindaichi!

175
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:31,415
This kid's got me beat in speed and reflexes... but!

176
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,575
If we're talking about sheer height... I've got 'em!

177
00:13:38,157 --> 00:13:38,918
It's up!

178
00:13:39,338 --> 00:13:40,352
Get it!

179
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:41,780
It's mine!

180
00:13:42,339 --> 00:13:43,505
You know just what to do!

181
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:44,219
Yeah!

182
00:13:45,123 --> 00:13:45,878
Left!

183
00:13:48,093 --> 00:13:48,824
Right now!

184
00:13:49,909 --> 00:13:50,608
Right here!

185
00:13:51,103 --> 00:13:53,637
This timing... at this angle!

186
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:56,764
It'll be perfect!

187
00:14:15,918 --> 00:14:17,386
Tobio Kageyama...

188
00:14:17,704 --> 00:14:19,419
You are evolving quickly...

189
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:22,600
and it might very well be my downfall.

190
00:14:23,577 --> 00:14:24,184
But...

191
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,065
not today.

192
00:14:51,544 --> 00:14:52,321
Let's go...

193
00:14:56,976 --> 00:14:59,625
Hinata, Kageyama. Let's line up.

194
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:04,928
I'm sorry, Captain...

195
00:15:05,097 --> 00:15:05,948
You didn't mess up.

196
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:08,361
And there's no need to be sorry.

197
00:15:11,398 --> 00:15:12,752
Thank you for the game.

198
00:15:39,599 --> 00:15:42,312
Listen up guys... I want to tell you something.

199
00:15:42,686 --> 00:15:45,724
The next time Karasuno gets a
chance to do a quick attack...

200
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:48,441
Kageyama's going to opt for the super version...

201
00:15:48,588 --> 00:15:49,879
I'll bet you anything.

202
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:53,798
So tell me, how did you know they'd go
for that freak quick attack at the end?

203
00:15:54,311 --> 00:15:58,092
Because Kageyama has been learning
and growing alongside his teammates.

204
00:15:59,109 --> 00:16:00,869
He's learned how to build up a rapport.

205
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:06,696
During that long rally, his physical
and mental exhaustion maxed out.

206
00:16:07,046 --> 00:16:12,650
At that moment, his back was against the wall,
and he was faced with an oh-so-vital opportunity.

207
00:16:12,836 --> 00:16:15,541
And for the new and improved Tobio Kageyama...

208
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:20,110
there was only one choice.

209
00:16:21,913 --> 00:16:22,565
Line up!

210
00:16:23,329 --> 00:16:24,540
Thank you for coming!

211
00:16:25,345 --> 00:16:26,761
Thank you for coming!

212
00:16:35,512 --> 00:16:36,520
Good game, guys!

213
00:16:36,545 --> 00:16:37,894
You did your best, guys!

214
00:16:45,344 --> 00:16:46,134
Let's go.

215
00:16:50,717 --> 00:16:52,049
Really takes me back.

216
00:16:52,885 --> 00:16:56,015
Always hated it when people told
us how great we did when we lost.

217
00:16:56,302 --> 00:16:57,952
There was nothin' I wanted to hear.

218
00:16:58,638 --> 00:17:01,258
But... now that I'm here on the other side of it...

219
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:03,373
I gotta be honest...

220
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:04,979
I don't what else to tell 'em.

221
00:17:08,347 --> 00:17:11,188
Listen... That last block was...

222
00:17:14,847 --> 00:17:18,558
We should head out... The next
team needs the court to warm up.

223
00:17:19,106 --> 00:17:21,225
We'll have to find somewhere else to cool down.

224
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,622
Senseki, fight!

225
00:17:24,905 --> 00:17:28,803
Seijoh will be going to the quarterfinal
after they take a little break.

226
00:17:36,153 --> 00:17:37,979
Senseki, fight!

227
00:17:38,025 --> 00:17:40,342
Fight, fight, fight! Fight, fight, fight!

228
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:46,768
I'm surprised you didn't tell them
it takes more than one guy to win.

229
00:17:47,095 --> 00:17:49,555
I mean... that's what you said a while back, isn't it?

230
00:17:50,703 --> 00:17:53,913
Well, Karasuno isn't a one-man show... I was wrong.

231
00:17:55,155 --> 00:17:56,470
'Cause you're a dumb-ass.

232
00:17:56,495 --> 00:17:57,410
Oh, come on!

233
00:17:58,445 --> 00:18:00,596
During that last play in the 2nd set,

234
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:05,065
Kageyama guessed that I'd send it to you...
That proved to me that he was finally changing

235
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:07,219
from a dictator into a real leader.

236
00:18:08,752 --> 00:18:12,632
At the time, I knew it was a possibility
that he'd give the ball to the shorty,

237
00:18:12,665 --> 00:18:16,296
even if he was still acting like a
dictator, but it wasn't a sure thing.

238
00:18:16,902 --> 00:18:20,305
I didn't realize the difference for
certain until later on in the game.

239
00:18:21,214 --> 00:18:23,441
As soon as he showed me that he could read my attack,

240
00:18:23,466 --> 00:18:26,803
that gave me the opportunity to
turn around and read his attack, too.

241
00:18:27,123 --> 00:18:28,365
You know what that means...

242
00:18:28,925 --> 00:18:32,066
Our little Kageyama's finally learned how to trust people.

243
00:18:34,296 --> 00:18:38,358
And... that... makes me even more annoyed.

244
00:18:50,249 --> 00:18:51,603
It's time for the meeting.

245
00:19:00,407 --> 00:19:01,109
Sorry.

246
00:19:03,697 --> 00:19:05,483
Oikawa read me like a book.

247
00:19:11,465 --> 00:19:13,196
Don't you apologize!

248
00:19:14,533 --> 00:19:15,180
Shut up!

249
00:19:15,715 --> 00:19:18,997
Stop making it sound like setting
the ball to me was a mistake!

250
00:19:22,802 --> 00:19:24,609
The meeting's about to start, you two.

251
00:19:28,491 --> 00:19:31,640
You two played an amazing game
today... You know that right?

252
00:19:34,077 --> 00:19:36,145
Yeah... but we lost.

253
00:19:36,451 --> 00:19:37,862
Yes, I know you did...

254
00:19:38,462 --> 00:19:41,077
But still... Would you call it a waste of time?

255
00:19:46,099 --> 00:19:48,028
Do you think losing means you're weak?

256
00:19:50,123 --> 00:19:53,376
If you think about it... losing is a trial by fire.

257
00:19:53,894 --> 00:19:55,564
To see if you can get back up...

258
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:57,789
after you've been knocked to the ground.

259
00:19:59,713 --> 00:20:02,364
But if you guys just stay lying down forever...

260
00:20:02,429 --> 00:20:04,898
then I'd say... that makes you weak.

261
00:21:51,954 --> 00:21:55,566
Hey... let's get some food... Don't worry I'm buyin'.

262
00:21:55,989 --> 00:21:58,539
What? You're treating us? But sir, we...

263
00:21:58,564 --> 00:22:00,089
Just do what I tell ya.

264
00:22:09,428 --> 00:22:11,064
Sorry to drop in so late.

265
00:22:11,731 --> 00:22:16,187
Not at all! You used to come
in right at close all the time.

266
00:22:23,304 --> 00:22:25,413
You kids worked really hard out there today...

267
00:22:25,781 --> 00:22:28,754
And all that strenuous activity
has worn down your muscles.

268
00:22:29,363 --> 00:22:31,815
By now, you're probably all in pretty bad shape.

269
00:22:33,697 --> 00:22:37,865
You build it back up with food.
That's how you gain muscle mass.

270
00:22:38,586 --> 00:22:40,264
This will make you stronger.

271
00:22:41,766 --> 00:22:44,794
Now dig in... You've all earned a good meal.

272
00:22:48,428 --> 00:22:49,462
Thanks for the food.

273
00:22:50,083 --> 00:22:50,681
Thank you.

274
00:22:51,585 --> 00:22:52,816
Thanks for the food.

275
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:55,200
Ah... Enjoy!

276
00:22:57,531 --> 00:22:58,840
Thank you for the food.

277
00:23:32,712 --> 00:23:33,850
Go on guys.

278
00:23:35,281 --> 00:23:35,886
Eat.

279
00:23:37,763 --> 00:23:39,303
Fill yourselves up...

280
00:23:40,954 --> 00:23:41,915
And enjoy it.

281
00:23:43,862 --> 00:23:44,837
And slowly...

282
00:23:47,534 --> 00:23:49,197
Slowly, but surely...

283
00:23:53,193 --> 00:23:54,940
You will get stronger.

284
00:23:59,492 --> 00:24:00,867
I'll pick up the check, Coach.

285
00:24:00,892 --> 00:24:03,471
Hey, don't sweat it, Specs... Check please!

286
00:24:03,496 --> 00:24:06,104
Here we are. I gave you a discount.

287
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:10,113
Thanks... Whoa! Damn, those boys can put it away!

288
00:24:10,138 --> 00:24:12,526
Next Haikyu!! "The Third Day."
