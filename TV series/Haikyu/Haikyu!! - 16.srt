1
00:00:10,824 --> 00:00:11,498
Oooh yeah!

2
00:00:11,523 --> 00:00:13,340
That's our dynamic duo!

3
00:00:13,943 --> 00:00:15,095
Well... Good try, man!

4
00:00:15,718 --> 00:00:16,739
Hang in there!

5
00:00:18,304 --> 00:00:21,108
Hm... looks like they're not doing that quick attack.

6
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:23,325
The one where he closes his eyes.

7
00:00:25,624 --> 00:00:27,011
They still need work...

8
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:31,586
But it looks to me as if they're able to
execute a normal quick attack now instead.

9
00:00:31,611 --> 00:00:32,100
Hm?

10
00:00:32,786 --> 00:00:36,409
It's sloppy, but at least they've
got control over the trajectory.

11
00:00:38,571 --> 00:00:39,913
That's a big difference...

12
00:00:40,126 --> 00:00:43,085
Those kids must have had quite a productive practice game.

13
00:00:43,902 --> 00:00:49,503
They've learned their weapons, built them up, and figured
out how to use the right attack for the right situation.

14
00:00:50,894 --> 00:00:53,143
Hmmm... well, how about that?

15
00:00:53,254 --> 00:00:56,495
They used to rely on raw power to score their points.

16
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,730
Now they're getting smart.

17
00:00:57,755 --> 00:00:58,467
One more!

18
00:01:01,348 --> 00:01:04,264
Yeah, but they still make a lot of rookie mistakes.

19
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:05,092
Can't argue with that.

20
00:01:05,117 --> 00:01:05,869
I'm sorry!

21
00:01:05,894 --> 00:01:08,840
But receives are the one thing
you can't perfect overnight.

22
00:01:08,989 --> 00:01:10,275
Your serve, Chaya!

23
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:11,153
One more!

24
00:01:13,248 --> 00:01:13,956
Noya!

25
00:01:23,315 --> 00:01:24,706
Yeah!

26
00:01:25,232 --> 00:01:27,670
Are these guys actually about to win the set?

27
00:01:27,893 --> 00:01:30,348
Yeah, that libero's not playing around, dude...

28
00:01:30,785 --> 00:01:31,738
And not just that...

29
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:36,226
I think that guy with the stubble is
really helping support Kageyama's sets.

30
00:01:38,087 --> 00:01:38,960
It's alright.

31
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:41,295
Yeah... let's just get ourselves a point.

32
00:01:41,415 --> 00:01:42,327
Okay!

33
00:01:43,235 --> 00:01:44,457
One more, guys!

34
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:48,826
Give us a good serve, Hinata!

35
00:01:50,313 --> 00:01:51,188
Yes, sir!

36
00:01:51,213 --> 00:01:52,196
We got this!

37
00:01:52,227 --> 00:01:52,909
Yeah!

38
00:03:27,273 --> 00:03:28,450
We did it!

39
00:03:29,748 --> 00:03:31,905
It was our biggest tournament in middle school.

40
00:03:32,193 --> 00:03:34,114
We won the first game by dumb luck.

41
00:03:34,837 --> 00:03:38,532
But in the second round, we were up
against a team we knew we couldn't beat.

42
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:43,022
And just as we were giving up,
do you remember what you said?

43
00:03:46,177 --> 00:03:48,519
They're middle schoolers just like we are...

44
00:03:48,722 --> 00:03:51,022
There's no reason we can't win this!

45
00:03:54,129 --> 00:03:55,868
We still have to try, okay?!

46
00:03:56,789 --> 00:03:58,919
Wow, you just never give up, do you?

47
00:03:59,955 --> 00:04:01,199
I can't give up now...

48
00:04:01,387 --> 00:04:02,876
It's my last tournament.

49
00:04:03,452 --> 00:04:05,313
They're just middle schoolers too, huh?

50
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:06,885
Yeah, good point!

51
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:09,244
And plus we just cleared our first round one!

52
00:04:10,299 --> 00:04:13,043
He's right! Let's win our first round two!

53
00:04:13,068 --> 00:04:14,360
Yeah!

54
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:18,015
Our spirits were high,

55
00:04:19,119 --> 00:04:22,377
but obviously that wasn't
enough to make us suddenly improve.

56
00:04:29,665 --> 00:04:30,838
I'm sorry...

57
00:04:33,381 --> 00:04:36,289
No. We're gonna take the next point!

58
00:04:44,499 --> 00:04:47,133
We lost that game, but we were expecting it...

59
00:04:47,985 --> 00:04:50,192
So it didn't really get us down that much.

60
00:04:51,939 --> 00:04:54,689
Actually, we were kind of relieved, because it meant,

61
00:04:54,714 --> 00:04:57,580
we wouldn't have to do any more
intense training the next day.

62
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:04,716
But you... you were the only one who was upset by it...

63
00:05:05,713 --> 00:05:10,831
I didn't understand why, but part of me was
a little jealous that you could feel that way.

64
00:05:20,394 --> 00:05:21,334
Yes!

65
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:24,258
Um... are you okay?

66
00:05:25,579 --> 00:05:26,673
Do it, Hinata!

67
00:05:27,324 --> 00:05:28,540
It's all yours.

68
00:05:28,654 --> 00:05:30,765
Hey, very nice receive, Tamagawa!

69
00:05:31,015 --> 00:05:32,387
Come to the left, here!

70
00:05:33,198 --> 00:05:34,382
Here, Ikejiri!

71
00:05:46,808 --> 00:05:48,983
So much for the "wingless crows."

72
00:05:49,008 --> 00:05:51,294
That's not what I was expecting at all.

73
00:05:51,438 --> 00:05:53,384
They're on a different level!

74
00:05:53,709 --> 00:05:54,499
Em...

75
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:04,419
Whenever there's a net between you, it
doesn't matter what anybody's ranking is anymore.

76
00:06:06,215 --> 00:06:08,719
We can't win unless... we try.

77
00:06:09,989 --> 00:06:10,513
Er...

78
00:06:14,219 --> 00:06:18,103
Well, I just mean... it's like my friend used to say...

79
00:06:19,454 --> 00:06:20,224
Time to go.

80
00:06:20,448 --> 00:06:21,017
Yeah.

81
00:06:22,321 --> 00:06:27,142
Jeez, I should've known it wouldn't
be as persuasive coming from me.

82
00:06:27,739 --> 00:06:29,015
I totally blew it...

83
00:06:30,117 --> 00:06:30,963
Man...

84
00:06:33,537 --> 00:06:34,587
Kageyama's up!

85
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,638
He got an ace!

86
00:06:40,723 --> 00:06:44,706
Looks like Karasuno's starting to get in
the groove after winning that first set, huh?

87
00:06:56,018 --> 00:06:56,835
Got it!

88
00:06:58,816 --> 00:06:59,486
Damn...

89
00:07:05,296 --> 00:07:06,192
That's high!

90
00:07:21,717 --> 00:07:22,549
We did it...

91
00:07:25,053 --> 00:07:27,882
Come on. It's one point. Is it that big a deal?

92
00:07:27,907 --> 00:07:31,330
Of course it is! This is the kind
of play that could change everything!

93
00:07:31,355 --> 00:07:32,173
Maybe you're right.

94
00:07:32,198 --> 00:07:33,062
You guys...

95
00:07:34,271 --> 00:07:36,693
Can't win unless we try... you know?

96
00:07:36,895 --> 00:07:38,228
And we're not giving up!

97
00:07:38,448 --> 00:07:41,224
Even small-time teams know they need to stick to it.

98
00:07:41,402 --> 00:07:42,621
Let's win this!

99
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,147
Yeah!

100
00:07:47,428 --> 00:07:48,090
Look out!

101
00:07:49,951 --> 00:07:50,766
Get it, Yui!

102
00:07:51,663 --> 00:07:52,203
Right!

103
00:07:54,119 --> 00:07:55,079
Let it go!

104
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:03,969
L, u, c, k, y! L, u, c, k, y, lucky!

105
00:08:09,542 --> 00:08:11,732
Even if you're not confident that you can win...

106
00:08:11,846 --> 00:08:15,180
And even if everyone around
you says that it's impossible...

107
00:08:15,603 --> 00:08:16,737
No matter what...

108
00:08:23,098 --> 00:08:25,318
"We can't allow ourselves to say 'never!'"

109
00:08:26,692 --> 00:08:27,337
Heads up!

110
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:28,940
Let's go!

111
00:08:28,965 --> 00:08:29,527
Get it!

112
00:08:31,477 --> 00:08:33,349
We did it!

113
00:08:34,235 --> 00:08:35,732
Don't let it get to you.

114
00:08:36,602 --> 00:08:38,822
It's my fault we missed that, Yui.

115
00:08:39,904 --> 00:08:41,919
Sorry! I just...

116
00:08:42,292 --> 00:08:43,908
Can't stop messing us up!

117
00:08:46,913 --> 00:08:48,765
Now's not the time for that stuff.

118
00:08:50,555 --> 00:08:53,228
On your feet... It's not over!

119
00:08:57,138 --> 00:08:58,234
Alright!

120
00:09:01,482 --> 00:09:03,534
Match point, and it's in their favor...

121
00:09:04,763 --> 00:09:07,935
It won't hurt Karasuno at all if they lose the next point.

122
00:09:10,184 --> 00:09:11,017
But for us...

123
00:09:11,767 --> 00:09:12,916
One more point.

124
00:09:13,366 --> 00:09:14,393
This isn't over!

125
00:09:16,793 --> 00:09:18,746
Bring it, Karasuno!

126
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:22,972
Sakurai!

127
00:09:24,206 --> 00:09:25,008
Ikejiri!

128
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,355
We haven't lost yet!

129
00:09:35,969 --> 00:09:37,726
This is not the end!

130
00:09:37,959 --> 00:09:39,030
Oh here!

131
00:09:58,323 --> 00:10:00,177
Yeah!

132
00:10:00,202 --> 00:10:01,901
Damn you!

133
00:10:03,726 --> 00:10:05,938
Next time... you're all mine!

134
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:08,433
Right! Take it back!

135
00:10:08,854 --> 00:10:09,594
Yeah!

136
00:10:12,183 --> 00:10:14,513
Whoa, they're taking this seriously.

137
00:10:17,703 --> 00:10:21,947
No one else in this whole gymnasium is
concerned with us or sees us as a threat.

138
00:10:24,828 --> 00:10:26,732
The only team playing us for keeps...

139
00:10:30,146 --> 00:10:30,901
is them.

140
00:10:52,149 --> 00:10:54,740
Get your head out of the clouds, dumbass! It's time to-

141
00:10:54,765 --> 00:10:55,437
We won.

142
00:10:55,462 --> 00:10:55,867
Hm?

143
00:10:56,747 --> 00:10:57,496
Uh-huh...

144
00:10:58,126 --> 00:11:00,284
So... that means we get to play again.

145
00:11:03,424 --> 00:11:05,556
Yeah... that's how it works.

146
00:11:06,652 --> 00:11:07,420
We won.

147
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:09,937
We won...

148
00:11:11,821 --> 00:11:12,972
We won!

149
00:11:14,429 --> 00:11:16,666
That means we can play some more volleyball!

150
00:11:18,354 --> 00:11:20,933
We get to stay in the court for a little while longer!

151
00:11:22,999 --> 00:11:25,247
That little guy's been dying to play a real game...

152
00:11:25,868 --> 00:11:28,463
And now he's finally getting his first taste of victory.

153
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:29,370
Yeah.

154
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,231
What're they thinking?

155
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:35,718
Don't these amateurs know they have
another game to play this afternoon?

156
00:11:35,961 --> 00:11:36,554
Hm?

157
00:11:36,634 --> 00:11:39,618
Well... they were gonna win that game either way...

158
00:11:39,895 --> 00:11:42,097
They should've saved up their energy for the next one-

159
00:11:42,128 --> 00:11:43,207
I disagree.

160
00:11:44,305 --> 00:11:45,522
They gave it their all...

161
00:11:45,702 --> 00:11:48,479
But we didn't see that special quick attack, did we?

162
00:11:49,697 --> 00:11:53,110
The other game's done too... And Date Tech dominated.

163
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:55,882
Ahhh... Karasuno versus Date Tech.

164
00:11:55,978 --> 00:11:57,447
Now that's more interesting.

165
00:11:58,592 --> 00:12:01,594
We should go... if we miss our next game, it won't matter.

166
00:12:11,627 --> 00:12:14,485
Aw, don't cry! It's fine!

167
00:12:14,578 --> 00:12:20,321
I'm sorry... they went after all my
serves. I gave them so many points...

168
00:12:24,377 --> 00:12:26,329
The point is to keep the ball in play...

169
00:12:26,354 --> 00:12:29,491
They were just better at that than us... so we lost.

170
00:12:29,599 --> 00:12:31,349
It's not anyone's fault!

171
00:12:33,439 --> 00:12:35,685
Captain... the teacher needs you.

172
00:12:35,885 --> 00:12:38,267
Okay... I'll be right back.

173
00:12:44,283 --> 00:12:46,619
Michimiya's really... strong.

174
00:12:47,003 --> 00:12:48,693
She practiced the hardest...

175
00:12:48,942 --> 00:12:50,949
But she doesn't seem all that upset.

176
00:12:51,089 --> 00:12:51,840
She is.

177
00:12:52,073 --> 00:12:52,531
Hm?

178
00:12:53,362 --> 00:12:57,232
It's true. She just puts on a brave
face whenever she's in front of us.

179
00:12:57,388 --> 00:12:58,404
It's almost time for the next game.

180
00:12:58,429 --> 00:13:01,498
But I'm sure, as soon as she has a moment to herself,

181
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:03,430
it'll all hit her.

182
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:25,398
I didn't do too bad, really...

183
00:13:25,899 --> 00:13:27,708
I didn't miss many practices.

184
00:13:29,922 --> 00:13:34,645
After I saw the game on TV, I said I'd
be playing to represent Japan one day.

185
00:13:35,361 --> 00:13:37,967
Even though I said it jokingly, part of me was serious.

186
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:42,996
But once I got into all that resistance
training, my enthusiasm fizzled out.

187
00:13:45,331 --> 00:13:46,022
Is this it?

188
00:13:47,012 --> 00:13:50,313
It's only June... How could it end so quickly?

189
00:13:50,994 --> 00:13:56,000
If only... I'd worked just a little
harder to improve while I had the chance.

190
00:13:57,011 --> 00:13:59,775
If only I'd pushed myself more during practice.

191
00:14:01,183 --> 00:14:03,501
If only I'd been a better captain...

192
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:07,745
If only I'd wanted badly enough
to make one more receive...

193
00:14:08,162 --> 00:14:12,136
If only... I'd made the time to run one more step...

194
00:14:12,916 --> 00:14:16,507
Maybe I would have gotten to play
volleyball for just a little while longer.

195
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:25,525
Sawamura!

196
00:14:28,847 --> 00:14:29,625
Ikejiri?

197
00:14:39,473 --> 00:14:43,646
Listen to me... please keep winning! For my team, too!

198
00:14:54,086 --> 00:14:56,732
Sure. We'll do our best!

199
00:15:02,723 --> 00:15:08,309
To think, tens of thousands of players around the
country are ending their seasons early, just like we are.

200
00:15:09,067 --> 00:15:13,299
To get to the nationals, you have to
win every single game in the preliminaries.

201
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,619
If this was a TV drama...

202
00:15:17,456 --> 00:15:20,193
The guys going to nationals would be the main characters,

203
00:15:20,891 --> 00:15:23,379
and our team would be extras or something.

204
00:15:24,894 --> 00:15:25,502
But hey...

205
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,197
We still got to play.

206
00:16:04,162 --> 00:16:05,734
At least we could still play...

207
00:16:08,221 --> 00:16:09,221
Volleyball.

208
00:16:54,045 --> 00:16:55,496
Karasuno was awesome.

209
00:16:55,521 --> 00:16:57,701
Yeah, that short guy really surprised me!

210
00:16:57,809 --> 00:16:58,664
No kidding.

211
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:01,997
Did you see those quick attacks he did? Impressive.

212
00:17:04,567 --> 00:17:08,249
Wh-what?! Can't I just be happy about this?!

213
00:17:08,274 --> 00:17:10,953
Nobody's ever made a big deal out of me like that before!

214
00:17:13,179 --> 00:17:14,954
I haven't said a word, Hinata...

215
00:17:14,978 --> 00:17:15,365
Ah...

216
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:18,429
In fact, I'm glad to see you getting some recognition.

217
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:22,905
The more the enemy teams pay
attention to you and feel intimidated...

218
00:17:22,953 --> 00:17:25,184
The greater the damage you'll be able to do.

219
00:17:26,218 --> 00:17:29,000
Uh... so I don't know what that means...

220
00:17:29,157 --> 00:17:31,315
But your face says it's something evil.

221
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:36,234
That's right, Kageyama.

222
00:17:36,569 --> 00:17:40,717
We're building a great reputation with everybody
out there talking about our little, red 10...

223
00:17:41,113 --> 00:17:43,372
So we need Hinata to shine out there.

224
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:48,139
So bright, the other team's blockers are
gonna be too blinded to know what's goin' on.

225
00:17:49,844 --> 00:17:54,853
Just so you know, we'll be using the same
starting lineup for round two as we did for round one.

226
00:17:59,955 --> 00:18:02,042
The next game will be starting at 1:30...

227
00:18:02,323 --> 00:18:03,615
Let's stay loose you guys.

228
00:18:03,741 --> 00:18:05,778
Now go get yourselves a light lunch.

229
00:18:06,343 --> 00:18:07,525
Don't fill up though.

230
00:18:07,785 --> 00:18:08,868
Yes, sir!

231
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:14,016
Next is that "iron wall" school with "no brows", right?

232
00:18:14,374 --> 00:18:15,232
Date Tech.

233
00:18:15,518 --> 00:18:16,885
Yeah yeah, that's the one.

234
00:18:18,421 --> 00:18:18,999
Listen...

235
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:24,565
I think the game back in March where Date
Tech beat us was the reason Asahi quit the club.

236
00:18:24,991 --> 00:18:27,267
Ah! Really? You think that was it?

237
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:32,670
In one of our games... every single one
of Asahi's spikes was completely shut down.

238
00:18:34,645 --> 00:18:35,872
They've got blockers...

239
00:18:36,469 --> 00:18:38,246
And they can stop Asahi.

240
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:40,441
Sorry to interrupt.

241
00:18:40,466 --> 00:18:40,957
Ah?

242
00:18:41,363 --> 00:18:42,427
You guys got a minute?

243
00:18:46,092 --> 00:18:46,758
Asahi.

244
00:18:49,195 --> 00:18:49,903
We should go.

245
00:18:53,539 --> 00:18:56,529
Listen to me, you guys. There's
something I want to address.

246
00:18:57,730 --> 00:18:59,699
Date Tech is a very tough opponent...

247
00:19:00,073 --> 00:19:04,546
I'm sure you know three months ago, that iron
wall block of theirs completely obliterated us.

248
00:19:06,009 --> 00:19:08,293
But now we have our special decoy!

249
00:19:08,317 --> 00:19:08,765
Ah!

250
00:19:11,501 --> 00:19:14,287
You have blazed a trail so Hinata could succeed.

251
00:19:15,576 --> 00:19:19,961
So... please blaze a trail for Asahi too!

252
00:19:28,436 --> 00:19:31,234
Okay! Time to win round two!

253
00:19:31,547 --> 00:19:33,697
Ooooh... Wuh?

254
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:43,898
Go, go, Date Tech, Date Tech, here we go!

255
00:19:43,923 --> 00:19:47,248
Go, go, Date Tech, Date Tech, here we go!

256
00:19:47,273 --> 00:19:50,635
Go, go, Date Tech, Date Tech, here we go!

257
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:53,830
Date Teeeeech... let's fight!

258
00:19:53,855 --> 00:19:55,473
Yeah!

259
00:19:55,498 --> 00:19:56,813
Run some laps!

260
00:19:58,764 --> 00:20:01,009
Well, they've got the scare tactics down, don't they?

261
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:02,597
Date Tech really scares me...

262
00:20:02,703 --> 00:20:05,460
That'd be like sharing the court with a bunch of monsters.

263
00:20:05,613 --> 00:20:11,092
Seriously, man! Did you see that team they played against
in round one? Dude, I felt really bad for their spiker.

264
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:14,890
Yeah, no matter what they did,
Date Tech shut 'em right down.

265
00:20:16,377 --> 00:20:17,394
Captains!

266
00:20:18,307 --> 00:20:19,411
Thank you for the game.

267
00:20:22,261 --> 00:20:26,750
Oh boy... I get the feeling this
entire gym wants Date Tech to win.

268
00:20:27,281 --> 00:20:29,404
Looks like we're on the receiving side...

269
00:20:29,608 --> 00:20:30,447
You ready, sir?

270
00:20:30,558 --> 00:20:31,066
Yep.

271
00:20:31,566 --> 00:20:33,109
Receiving drills! Let's go!

272
00:20:33,134 --> 00:20:33,942
Sir!

273
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:36,140
Alright! Let's do this!

274
00:20:36,165 --> 00:20:37,040
Right!

275
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:40,340
It's been three months since Date Tech destroyed us.

276
00:20:42,363 --> 00:20:44,327
Our team's definitely getting better...

277
00:20:44,985 --> 00:20:48,927
But I think the third-years might still
have the last defeat stuck in their minds.

278
00:20:49,131 --> 00:20:55,226
And we can't let that linger. Best course of action
right now is to stop 'em from obsessing over Date Tech.

279
00:20:56,992 --> 00:20:58,492
Rollinggggg...

280
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:02,305
Thundeeeeeer!

281
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:03,539
Again!

282
00:21:12,692 --> 00:21:13,653
There ya go.

283
00:21:13,876 --> 00:21:18,786
Nice! Killer receive, Noya! I mean,
that was perfect! Except for the name...

284
00:21:18,811 --> 00:21:20,367
You wanna say that to me again, baldy?!

285
00:21:20,392 --> 00:21:23,584
Ooh, teach me! Teach me the again too!

286
00:21:23,891 --> 00:21:25,346
How was that different than the last one?

287
00:21:25,371 --> 00:21:26,490
At least he got it.

288
00:21:26,727 --> 00:21:28,192
You never quit, do you?

289
00:21:28,822 --> 00:21:31,630
Tone it down, dude. Daichi might get mad again.

290
00:21:32,218 --> 00:21:36,021
Alright listen here! You guys
have nothing to be afraid of at all!

291
00:21:36,046 --> 00:21:36,711
Hm?

292
00:21:36,965 --> 00:21:38,779
Focus on what's in front of you!

293
00:21:39,717 --> 00:21:42,132
I promise I'll always have your back.

294
00:21:45,591 --> 00:21:48,320
Whoa... he's amazing!

295
00:21:51,779 --> 00:21:52,818
Pretty cool.

296
00:21:55,611 --> 00:21:59,505
That's great! Everybody's acting
like their usual selves again!

297
00:21:59,724 --> 00:22:00,325
Yeah.

298
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:04,902
He may be short, and his hair,
ridiculous... But he's reliable.

299
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:07,454
The libero's not just there for defense...

300
00:22:07,751 --> 00:22:11,212
Another big part of his job is to
support the team from behind the scenes.

301
00:22:12,202 --> 00:22:14,517
We've got ourselves a hell of a libero.

302
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:18,487
Line up!

303
00:22:24,712 --> 00:22:26,239
Thank you for the game!

304
00:23:59,556 --> 00:24:02,500
So, no-brows got in your way once before, Asahi?

305
00:24:02,525 --> 00:24:03,670
Uh, yeah...

306
00:24:03,695 --> 00:24:05,434
Shouldn't he be scared of you?

307
00:24:05,459 --> 00:24:07,764
Yeah, you look so much older than he does.

308
00:24:07,788 --> 00:24:09,051
Oh, come on!

309
00:24:09,076 --> 00:24:10,218
Great job, guys...

310
00:24:10,289 --> 00:24:12,484
Next Haikyu!! "The iron wall".
