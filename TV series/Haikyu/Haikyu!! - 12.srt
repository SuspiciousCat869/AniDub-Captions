1
00:00:07,656 --> 00:00:09,983
I'll be seeing you at nationals this year.

2
00:00:10,088 --> 00:00:13,260
Hmph! Yeah, that's what you say every year, Ukai.

3
00:00:13,365 --> 00:00:15,947
Oh be quiet! This is going to be the one.

4
00:00:16,299 --> 00:00:21,915
This oughta be good! The trashcan showdown,
cats versus crows! Can't wait to see it!

5
00:00:22,274 --> 00:00:28,139
But that June at the Inter-High preliminaries, both
schools narrowly missed earning a ticket to nationals.

6
00:00:29,022 --> 00:00:33,866
In march of the following year, Karasuno
High, representing Miyagi prefecture,

7
00:00:33,913 --> 00:00:37,766
and Nekoma high, acting as
Tokyo's second representative school,

8
00:00:37,914 --> 00:00:40,863
both appeared at the Spring
High School National Tournament.

9
00:00:41,236 --> 00:00:47,426
Karasuno was defeated in the third game, and Nekoma made
it to the quarterfinals, before they were also eliminated.

10
00:00:48,237 --> 00:00:52,485
After that, the two schools
held many, many practice games...

11
00:00:52,682 --> 00:00:57,929
But both coaches eventually retired without
ever having faced each other in an official match.

12
00:00:58,346 --> 00:01:02,586
These events led to the steady decline
of both teams over the years to come.

13
00:01:12,362 --> 00:01:13,113
But now...

14
00:01:14,668 --> 00:01:15,615
Gah!

15
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:20,094
Their fated rematch is about to start!

16
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,040
Kenma!

17
00:02:55,685 --> 00:02:56,221
Huh?

18
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:57,748
Hey.

19
00:02:57,862 --> 00:02:59,663
You're really on the Nekoma team?!

20
00:02:59,871 --> 00:03:00,695
Uh-huh.

21
00:03:01,315 --> 00:03:03,443
How come you didn't tell me that when we met?

22
00:03:03,921 --> 00:03:05,710
Well, you... Didn't ask.

23
00:03:07,786 --> 00:03:11,953
But when you left, you said "later", so
you must've known I was gonna be here, right?!

24
00:03:12,456 --> 00:03:16,321
Uh, you had "Karasuno High School"
written on your t-shirt, so...

25
00:03:16,528 --> 00:03:18,110
Well, well, well!

26
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:21,988
You know, that's our setter...
What's your business with him?

27
00:03:22,989 --> 00:03:23,967
Calm down.

28
00:03:24,098 --> 00:03:26,468
I... I'm sorry! Ah!

29
00:03:26,508 --> 00:03:32,276
And what about you? Shorty's with us... so
what's your business with him, brush head?!

30
00:03:32,301 --> 00:03:33,532
What's it to you, buddy?

31
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:36,307
You lookin' to rumble? Eh city boy?

32
00:03:36,537 --> 00:03:38,888
Hm-um yeah you guys are about to rumble...

33
00:03:38,913 --> 00:03:40,356
The game's just about to start.

34
00:03:40,534 --> 00:03:43,128
And stop saying "city boy". Nobody says that.

35
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,474
Yamamoto please...

36
00:03:45,499 --> 00:03:47,324
Could you stop picking fights all the time?

37
00:03:47,349 --> 00:03:49,162
You're making a damn fool of yourself.

38
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:52,886
Yeah.. That's our team idiot...
You'll just have to excuse him.

39
00:03:52,911 --> 00:03:54,353
Sorry about ours too...

40
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:55,547
He's embarrassing.

41
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:07,031
Girl... Hot...

42
00:04:07,465 --> 00:04:08,974
Sweet! Easy on the eyes!

43
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:10,396
Love me a girl manager!

44
00:04:10,421 --> 00:04:12,438
Yeah, Yakisoba!

45
00:04:12,908 --> 00:04:15,170
Damn you, Karasuno!

46
00:04:15,303 --> 00:04:17,077
Jeez, get it together, would you?!

47
00:04:18,338 --> 00:04:21,258
Uh Hinata... How do you already know one of those guys?

48
00:04:21,283 --> 00:04:23,424
Oh, I met him earlier while I was out...

49
00:04:23,449 --> 00:04:25,450
I guess he's Nekoma's setter, that's all.

50
00:04:25,475 --> 00:04:26,453
A setter...

51
00:04:28,593 --> 00:04:30,646
I look forward to playing with you today.

52
00:04:30,844 --> 00:04:33,680
And we're also looking forward to playing with you guys.

53
00:04:33,844 --> 00:04:36,113
Whoa! Check this out!

54
00:04:36,138 --> 00:04:37,709
What? It's just a gym.

55
00:04:37,927 --> 00:04:39,925
Ah, so he's the shrewd type.

56
00:04:40,245 --> 00:04:43,970
Man, 8 years, huh? Barely
recognized you with that haircut.

57
00:04:44,049 --> 00:04:47,138
Yeah, well maybe you oughta try
something new once in a while, Naoi.

58
00:04:50,834 --> 00:04:52,061
Ah, Keishin!

59
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:52,530
Hm?

60
00:04:52,865 --> 00:04:55,506
Coach Nekomata! It's been a while.

61
00:04:56,115 --> 00:05:00,123
I see you're still the spitting image
of your old grandfather, aren't you, boy?

62
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:05,064
I-I'm Ittetsu Takeda, sir! I spoke to you
on the phone. Thank you so much for your time.

63
00:05:05,432 --> 00:05:09,921
Well, after all those dozens of phone calls, I
started feeling like I had to respond one way or another.

64
00:05:09,946 --> 00:05:11,415
Ah, I'm sorry about that!

65
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,661
Aw, I'm just pullin' your leg, son!

66
00:05:13,761 --> 00:05:17,585
We've already had ourselves several good
practice games over the past three days...

67
00:05:17,616 --> 00:05:19,880
And I expect this one'll be interesting too.

68
00:05:19,962 --> 00:05:21,367
Yes! Thank you, sir!

69
00:05:22,407 --> 00:05:25,392
Oh, and it matters not to me that Ukai's not here...

70
00:05:25,962 --> 00:05:27,515
We'll still destroy you.

71
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:34,104
We haven't been a team for very long...

72
00:05:34,285 --> 00:05:36,407
We're still kind of finding our groove...

73
00:05:36,698 --> 00:05:38,330
So we're not very coordinated.

74
00:05:38,657 --> 00:05:42,923
On top of all that, this is our first
game using our new starting line-up...

75
00:05:43,307 --> 00:05:45,906
We don't know anything about Nekoma as a team,

76
00:05:46,044 --> 00:05:49,302
but whatever kind of wall we
find ourselves up against today...

77
00:05:49,921 --> 00:05:51,479
We can rise above it!

78
00:05:53,482 --> 00:05:54,953
We are plasma.

79
00:05:55,623 --> 00:05:57,516
Let's make our motions fluid.

80
00:05:58,304 --> 00:06:02,021
Keep the oxygen flowing so the
brain can work to its full potential!

81
00:06:03,104 --> 00:06:04,072
Here we go!

82
00:06:04,168 --> 00:06:05,186
Okay!

83
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:09,308
Kuroo... don't say that stuff... It's really embarrassing.

84
00:06:09,785 --> 00:06:12,496
Aw, don't be like that! It adds to the mood.

85
00:06:12,578 --> 00:06:14,704
It helps us get into the right mindset.

86
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:16,225
Guess you're outnumbered.

87
00:06:18,713 --> 00:06:20,084
Sweet! Just in time!

88
00:06:20,142 --> 00:06:21,918
Ah yes here we go again.

89
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:23,879
Cats versus crows!

90
00:06:25,381 --> 00:06:30,234
Let the practice game between Nekoma
High and Karasuno High officially begin!

91
00:06:31,518 --> 00:06:33,096
Thank you for the game!

92
00:06:33,831 --> 00:06:35,439
You don't seem as nervous today.

93
00:06:35,611 --> 00:06:36,385
Really?

94
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:38,615
Huh?

95
00:06:39,382 --> 00:06:40,255
You're tiny!

96
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,368
Gah! Don't you mock me!

97
00:06:42,393 --> 00:06:44,132
I'm not mocking you at all, dude!

98
00:06:44,157 --> 00:06:45,300
Huh? Really?

99
00:06:45,325 --> 00:06:45,762
Yup!

100
00:06:46,298 --> 00:06:46,841
Tch!

101
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,875
He's as paranoid as always.

102
00:06:51,303 --> 00:06:52,067
Hey Shoyo.

103
00:06:52,092 --> 00:06:52,639
Huh?

104
00:06:52,834 --> 00:06:56,365
Remember when I told you that I
think Nekoma's got a pretty good team?

105
00:06:57,209 --> 00:06:58,858
Well, it's not because I'm good...

106
00:06:59,912 --> 00:07:00,847
We all are.

107
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:03,611
Huh?

108
00:07:05,245 --> 00:07:06,433
You can do it, Kenma!

109
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:07,226
Asahi!

110
00:07:07,556 --> 00:07:08,172
I got it!

111
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:10,007
Agh, sorry, guys!

112
00:07:10,286 --> 00:07:12,479
That's what happens when you skip for a month!

113
00:07:12,504 --> 00:07:13,416
Uh, my bad!

114
00:07:14,008 --> 00:07:15,021
Kageyama cover!

115
00:07:15,046 --> 00:07:15,608
Got it!

116
00:07:27,111 --> 00:07:29,853
Whoa, that was crazy fast! But how...?!

117
00:07:29,878 --> 00:07:32,132
A quick-attack from that distance?!

118
00:07:32,157 --> 00:07:35,532
How'd he do that? I mean the
kid didn't even open his eyes!

119
00:07:35,557 --> 00:07:37,145
Heh heh!

120
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:40,079
That's amazing... You've got skill.

121
00:07:41,842 --> 00:07:43,176
Good job, Hinata!

122
00:07:43,201 --> 00:07:43,979
Thanks!

123
00:07:44,478 --> 00:07:45,799
Let's do this thing!

124
00:07:46,845 --> 00:07:47,411
Kuah!

125
00:07:47,719 --> 00:07:48,496
Comin' atcha!

126
00:07:49,175 --> 00:07:50,256
Eat this!

127
00:07:51,297 --> 00:07:52,561
Yes, nice receive!

128
00:07:53,189 --> 00:07:53,951
Another one!

129
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:57,471
Agh!

130
00:08:02,928 --> 00:08:05,088
Well, nobody could've retrieved that, right?

131
00:08:05,358 --> 00:08:06,555
You got this!

132
00:08:09,391 --> 00:08:10,176
All yours!

133
00:08:10,201 --> 00:08:10,811
Thanks!

134
00:08:11,753 --> 00:08:12,757
Hey, nice work.

135
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,204
Oh, thanks Suga...

136
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:17,577
That libero of theirs isn't playing around.

137
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:18,295
Huh?

138
00:08:18,637 --> 00:08:22,029
Even though he's never seen Asahi spike... he got to it.

139
00:08:23,092 --> 00:08:24,230
Ah! Sorry!

140
00:08:24,318 --> 00:08:25,930
Sorry, but could you hold this for me?

141
00:08:25,955 --> 00:08:26,527
Uh-huh...

142
00:08:27,019 --> 00:08:28,026
It's cool, guys!

143
00:08:28,051 --> 00:08:29,261
Go for it, Noya!

144
00:08:29,315 --> 00:08:31,967
Nishinoya sure moves around a lot, doesn't he?

145
00:08:32,128 --> 00:08:36,710
Yes sir... the libero specializes in defense so
he'll come in and out several times during a game.

146
00:08:37,172 --> 00:08:42,766
Our middle blockers, Hinata and Tsukishima, have to go
to the rear to serve, and then after the rally's done,

147
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:44,925
they switch out positions with Nishinoya.

148
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:47,277
Aw yeah, it's my turn!

149
00:08:48,109 --> 00:08:48,867
Yeah!

150
00:08:55,848 --> 00:08:57,385
'Kay guys, now bring it in.

151
00:08:57,989 --> 00:09:00,458
Wow. That's a pretty early time-out don'tcha think.

152
00:09:01,104 --> 00:09:03,884
Their spiker and libero are extremely talented.

153
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:08,125
But their setter is the most
outrageous player in the whole bunch.

154
00:09:08,789 --> 00:09:10,222
That boy's a monster.

155
00:09:10,448 --> 00:09:13,915
He's speed-setting straight to
the spiker's optimum strike point.

156
00:09:14,361 --> 00:09:16,357
He could thread a needle with that control.

157
00:09:17,037 --> 00:09:19,517
Well, not much you can do about a prodigy like that.

158
00:09:19,886 --> 00:09:23,507
But... just because they have one genius on the team...

159
00:09:23,701 --> 00:09:25,883
That doesn't necessarily mean they'll win.

160
00:09:27,851 --> 00:09:30,387
If their team's offense is hinging on Hinata...

161
00:09:30,412 --> 00:09:32,335
Then we should stop him first.

162
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,359
Who's Hinata?

163
00:09:33,462 --> 00:09:35,225
It's Karasuno's number 10.

164
00:09:35,789 --> 00:09:38,753
Right, he and number 9 make for a deadly combination.

165
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,509
A demon... and his iron club...

166
00:09:42,214 --> 00:09:45,109
So our first step is taking the club away.

167
00:09:47,955 --> 00:09:50,167
Alright! They're in top form!

168
00:09:50,363 --> 00:09:52,156
I'm getting bad vibes from these guys.

169
00:09:52,181 --> 00:09:52,635
Uh-hm?

170
00:09:53,436 --> 00:09:56,979
For some reason I get the feeling
they're scrutinizing our every move.

171
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,939
No way!

172
00:10:01,964 --> 00:10:04,764
It's okay, bro! You were pretty close!

173
00:10:04,789 --> 00:10:07,156
Their number 7's got his eye on Hinata.

174
00:10:08,067 --> 00:10:10,606
Nekoma decided to move their blockers to the side.

175
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:13,099
Mm-hm... an area block.

176
00:10:14,323 --> 00:10:15,014
What the...

177
00:10:15,394 --> 00:10:18,043
That kind of block isn't designed to track the ace.

178
00:10:18,438 --> 00:10:19,573
Don't tell me...

179
00:10:20,101 --> 00:10:21,831
They're trying to lead Hinata.

180
00:10:22,927 --> 00:10:25,907
We have to confine Hinata to a smaller area.

181
00:10:27,436 --> 00:10:29,037
From what I've seen so far...

182
00:10:29,271 --> 00:10:32,803
I think he just charges straight to
wherever we don't have any blockers.

183
00:10:33,619 --> 00:10:36,657
So if we block him on one side, he'll go the opposite way.

184
00:10:38,044 --> 00:10:39,915
And then you just have to follow him.

185
00:10:39,994 --> 00:10:41,121
You got it!

186
00:10:41,146 --> 00:10:42,645
That combo move is scary...

187
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:46,283
I think anybody would be thrown
off guard the first time they see it.

188
00:10:46,851 --> 00:10:50,171
But... just like when you can't beat a level in a game...

189
00:10:50,334 --> 00:10:51,402
The more you try...

190
00:10:53,195 --> 00:10:54,325
the better you get.

191
00:10:54,971 --> 00:10:57,515
Okay, I just gotta follow number 10!

192
00:11:01,148 --> 00:11:02,797
He got to it again?!

193
00:11:05,173 --> 00:11:06,403
It's a quick attack!

194
00:11:10,425 --> 00:11:11,018
Dammit...

195
00:11:11,043 --> 00:11:12,060
Don't let it get to you!

196
00:11:12,085 --> 00:11:13,119
A setter dump.

197
00:11:14,557 --> 00:11:16,247
Hey... don't tense up.

198
00:11:17,321 --> 00:11:19,005
They see your weaknesses.

199
00:11:21,321 --> 00:11:21,792
Front!

200
00:11:23,715 --> 00:11:25,297
Sorry Noya, can you cover it?

201
00:11:25,322 --> 00:11:26,226
Sure thing!

202
00:11:26,428 --> 00:11:27,268
Right side!

203
00:11:27,767 --> 00:11:29,977
Huh? Why's he calling for a set?

204
00:11:30,002 --> 00:11:31,319
Kageyama.. Heads up!

205
00:11:38,215 --> 00:11:40,327
Hey! That one's called a straight hit!

206
00:11:40,376 --> 00:11:43,252
It goes down the side! Be selective with your spikes!

207
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,987
His perfectionism really starting to piss me off. Heh...

208
00:11:48,012 --> 00:11:49,241
You and me both.

209
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:54,930
Nice drop, Tsuki!

210
00:11:55,546 --> 00:11:59,411
This guy thinks things through, and
he's in tune with his surroundings...

211
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:02,646
He's the complete opposite of Shoyo.

212
00:12:03,349 --> 00:12:04,164
Let's go!

213
00:12:04,189 --> 00:12:04,886
You got it?

214
00:12:04,911 --> 00:12:05,799
You bet!

215
00:12:07,037 --> 00:12:08,191
Nice receive!

216
00:12:08,566 --> 00:12:10,114
Who do I send it to?

217
00:12:10,951 --> 00:12:11,688
To the right?

218
00:12:12,581 --> 00:12:13,158
Left.

219
00:12:14,199 --> 00:12:15,859
So he was watching closely.

220
00:12:16,089 --> 00:12:17,248
He's quick too.

221
00:12:22,451 --> 00:12:24,643
That glance was just a decoy!

222
00:12:25,443 --> 00:12:28,069
Kenma is not a fan of interacting with people...

223
00:12:28,268 --> 00:12:32,765
But he eventually became so conscious of
their eyes that he turned it into an advantage.

224
00:12:33,183 --> 00:12:35,444
His skills of prediction are razor-sharp.

225
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:38,715
He can tell a lot about his
opponents just by observing them.

226
00:12:39,524 --> 00:12:43,234
But of course, that's not what makes
our team such a force to be reckoned with.

227
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:04,336
All my life... I've never had
any luck making friends for myself.

228
00:13:05,318 --> 00:13:07,339
I don't have any interest in other people.

229
00:13:08,029 --> 00:13:10,510
I'm always extremely aware of their eyes.

230
00:13:11,306 --> 00:13:13,198
I did all I could not to stand out.

231
00:13:14,735 --> 00:13:18,433
Since he was my age and lived
close by, Kuroo was my one friend.

232
00:13:19,873 --> 00:13:24,423
I don't like sports very much, but
I've always played around with volleyball.

233
00:13:25,667 --> 00:13:29,302
When we were in middle school, Kuroo
talked me into joining volleyball club...

234
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:31,932
It was okay, I guess.

235
00:13:32,501 --> 00:13:34,545
I kept playing it when I got to high school...

236
00:13:35,972 --> 00:13:38,112
Our school had a good team my first year...

237
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:42,797
But there were so many people, I
couldn't deal with being a part of it.

238
00:13:43,069 --> 00:13:46,460
Hey first-year, clean up faster so we can go home!

239
00:13:46,609 --> 00:13:48,982
There's nothing special about upperclassmen.

240
00:13:49,131 --> 00:13:51,190
They were just born a year or two sooner...

241
00:13:51,389 --> 00:13:53,915
So why do they act like they're better than everyone else?

242
00:13:56,375 --> 00:14:00,622
You can't quit... Not only do you have
greater observational skills than us...

243
00:14:00,816 --> 00:14:02,458
You're also a good strategist.

244
00:14:02,825 --> 00:14:05,966
All the first- and second-years
already know how amazing you are...

245
00:14:06,769 --> 00:14:09,232
This team's gonna go really far with your help.

246
00:14:14,149 --> 00:14:15,549
He doesn't stand out.

247
00:14:15,711 --> 00:14:16,239
Huh?

248
00:14:16,848 --> 00:14:21,474
Even an amateur can tell that Kageyama's got a
certain intense greatness about him, you know?

249
00:14:22,476 --> 00:14:26,264
I'm not saying Nekoma's setter isn't
doing amazing stuff out there, but...

250
00:14:26,652 --> 00:14:28,226
you wouldn't know just by watching him.

251
00:14:29,212 --> 00:14:32,001
Well yeah... That's because their receives are stable.

252
00:14:32,497 --> 00:14:36,515
The most important component for a
diverse arsenal of attacks is solid receiving.

253
00:14:36,601 --> 00:14:39,700
You want receives that land the
ball neatly above the setter's head.

254
00:14:40,216 --> 00:14:43,768
The better they are, the more room the
setter has to put his abilities to work.

255
00:14:45,722 --> 00:14:50,364
We've got Kageyama, holding this ragtag
group together with his overwhelming talent...

256
00:14:50,954 --> 00:14:54,786
Whereas Nekoma's setter is supported by
the receiving skills of his entire team.

257
00:14:56,985 --> 00:14:58,385
We are plasma...

258
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:01,150
Let's make our motions fluid...

259
00:15:02,105 --> 00:15:05,806
Keep the oxygen flowing... So the
brain can work to its full potential!

260
00:15:09,685 --> 00:15:10,560
One touch!

261
00:15:11,757 --> 00:15:13,174
Nice cover, Yaku!

262
00:15:13,492 --> 00:15:16,048
We don't need a superstar for the team ace.

263
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:21,524
All we have to do is keep racking up
points one by one, slowly but surely.

264
00:15:25,406 --> 00:15:28,839
I'm really going for it on the
next spike, so give me a set, okay?

265
00:15:29,025 --> 00:15:31,033
But that's really risky for us right now...

266
00:15:31,193 --> 00:15:33,210
One mistake and we lose the set.

267
00:15:34,124 --> 00:15:35,030
I know that!

268
00:15:35,502 --> 00:15:36,300
Trust me!

269
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:39,159
Nice!

270
00:15:40,153 --> 00:15:42,973
But it's just like when you
can't beat a level in a game...

271
00:15:43,459 --> 00:15:44,525
The more you try...

272
00:15:51,723 --> 00:15:52,808
the better you get.

273
00:16:00,914 --> 00:16:02,415
Finally got you that time!

274
00:16:03,124 --> 00:16:04,560
Alright!

275
00:16:06,384 --> 00:16:08,626
Look... We can't get discouraged right now...

276
00:16:08,651 --> 00:16:10,134
We can take the next set!

277
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:13,001
There's not a spike in the
world that can't be stopped, red...

278
00:16:13,073 --> 00:16:14,117
You gotta stay focused.

279
00:16:14,142 --> 00:16:15,577
We'll nail this one for sure!

280
00:16:15,602 --> 00:16:16,903
Kick its ass!

281
00:16:18,413 --> 00:16:19,082
Right!

282
00:16:22,057 --> 00:16:23,570
Aw, not again.

283
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:25,835
Nice block, Inuoka!

284
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,644
Their number 7's no joke.

285
00:16:27,669 --> 00:16:29,710
He's got Hinata's patterns figured out.

286
00:16:38,007 --> 00:16:39,329
Nice cover, Daichi!

287
00:16:39,772 --> 00:16:40,313
Left! Tanaka!

288
00:16:40,338 --> 00:16:43,696
I can smell you wondering why I'm
not taking Hinata out of the game?

289
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:45,235
Nope.

290
00:16:45,741 --> 00:16:48,514
If this was an official game, I probably would have...

291
00:16:48,983 --> 00:16:52,064
But for now I'd rather give
him a chance to find a solution.

292
00:16:52,669 --> 00:16:56,987
Of course, if this makes him lose his will
to fight, I'll take him out in a heartbeat.

293
00:17:01,668 --> 00:17:02,606
He juked him!

294
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:06,826
Damnit!

295
00:17:06,888 --> 00:17:08,013
So close!

296
00:17:12,126 --> 00:17:15,597
He was completely shut down during his
first and only game in middle school...

297
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:19,287
And now he's no match for
Tsukishima's height in high school.

298
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:24,816
So he found a way to overcome those
setbacks and face even the tallest opponents...

299
00:17:25,534 --> 00:17:28,874
But now, even when he uses his best attack...

300
00:17:29,925 --> 00:17:32,372
All it takes is a single blocker to stop him!

301
00:17:32,994 --> 00:17:35,668
He's staring straight into the "human wall".

302
00:17:36,142 --> 00:17:39,029
The more it stops you, the more your heart breaks.

303
00:17:39,254 --> 00:17:39,787
Huh?

304
00:17:49,092 --> 00:17:50,289
He's smiling.

305
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:52,323
Hinata...

306
00:17:52,491 --> 00:17:54,955
Somehow... That was different.

307
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:55,458
What?

308
00:17:56,233 --> 00:17:58,921
It wasn't the same as the confusion I felt back then.

309
00:17:59,549 --> 00:18:03,085
When I couldn't see past the blockers to
the other side and didn't know what to do.

310
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:05,276
It wasn't like that.

311
00:18:06,354 --> 00:18:09,194
I can tell my opponent's having
trouble keeping up with me.

312
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:12,587
Before, all I felt was fear
and hate whenever I got blocked.

313
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:16,177
Now when a blocker stands in my way, it's just exciting!

314
00:18:17,628 --> 00:18:20,332
With your amazing sets and a good strategy...

315
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,891
I think I can find a way to get past him.

316
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:25,681
All I want is...

317
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:28,212
One more set... How's that sound?

318
00:18:30,407 --> 00:18:31,718
Yeah we'll see.

319
00:18:33,712 --> 00:18:34,628
Let's go!

320
00:18:40,927 --> 00:18:41,380
What?

321
00:18:49,198 --> 00:18:49,791
His...

322
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:51,032
eyes were open...

323
00:18:51,527 --> 00:18:52,298
Yeah, you're right.

324
00:18:52,323 --> 00:18:53,727
Hey, what was that?

325
00:18:53,865 --> 00:18:55,934
Hinata's been leaving it up to Kageyama...

326
00:18:56,232 --> 00:18:57,549
Something must be wrong!

327
00:18:57,574 --> 00:18:59,867
Hey, time out, time out!

328
00:19:03,266 --> 00:19:07,298
I-it's not that I don't trust you
or anything, but... Uhh let's see...

329
00:19:07,323 --> 00:19:09,321
Dude. What are you freaking out about?

330
00:19:09,346 --> 00:19:14,056
Kageyama... from now on, I want you to
try sending slightly weaker sets to Hinata.

331
00:19:14,658 --> 00:19:16,068
No more direct delivery.

332
00:19:16,865 --> 00:19:18,811
So you want an indirect delivery?

333
00:19:19,088 --> 00:19:19,998
A what?

334
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:23,869
Your sets are usually powerful
with a straight trajectory...

335
00:19:24,154 --> 00:19:25,626
It needs to float a little bit.

336
00:19:26,925 --> 00:19:30,241
I know it's kinda tricky to change it
on the spot though... Can you handle it?

337
00:19:31,371 --> 00:19:32,259
I can do it.

338
00:19:33,802 --> 00:19:36,031
So what's the purpose of floating the set?

339
00:19:36,411 --> 00:19:39,008
I want to give Hinata some extra freedom in the air...

340
00:19:39,359 --> 00:19:42,554
I noticed that he was trying to
dodge that blocker mid-jump just now.

341
00:19:42,579 --> 00:19:43,342
Huh?

342
00:19:43,831 --> 00:19:47,625
There's a technique for shaking off blockers.
It looked like that's what he was after.

343
00:19:48,643 --> 00:19:50,912
Too bad it was a complete and utter failure.

344
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:00,740
Up 'til now, I could hit it without thinking at all...

345
00:20:01,227 --> 00:20:03,498
It's so weird to be the one lining up the shot!

346
00:20:03,574 --> 00:20:04,908
One more time-out!

347
00:20:05,441 --> 00:20:08,374
Whoa whoa whoa... You gotta calm down, kid.

348
00:20:08,435 --> 00:20:11,848
Yes, sir! I'm sorry, I just
keep screwing up over and over.

349
00:20:11,873 --> 00:20:13,500
Hey, don't even worry about that!

350
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:16,376
Thanks to you, I always get to hit the ball unmarked!

351
00:20:16,401 --> 00:20:20,093
There's nothin' wrong with lettin' me carry
the game every once in a while, right buddy?

352
00:20:20,198 --> 00:20:22,550
Okay, but Asahi's getting more points than you.

353
00:20:22,575 --> 00:20:26,080
Ah! That's beside the point! Who
asked you?! Ain't that right, Asahi?

354
00:20:26,105 --> 00:20:30,009
Oh, yeah, it doesn't matter... We're
gonna win all of those points back.

355
00:20:30,975 --> 00:20:34,546
But if you keep messing up, you're
probably still gonna get switched out.

356
00:20:34,991 --> 00:20:36,166
Tsukishima!

357
00:20:37,008 --> 00:20:41,605
If you're trying to learn something new, then you
should keep at it... You might jump all by yourself,

358
00:20:41,925 --> 00:20:44,118
but we're all right here to back you up.

359
00:20:45,504 --> 00:20:49,700
And besides, Mr. Ace here says he's
gonna win all of those points back for us.

360
00:20:50,112 --> 00:20:52,584
Daichi! Don't put too much pressure on him.

361
00:20:52,719 --> 00:20:54,311
What if he breaks into a million pieces?

362
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:56,227
That's right! This guy's fragile, you know!

363
00:20:56,252 --> 00:20:59,624
Uhh... can we just get back to the game? Please.

364
00:21:02,444 --> 00:21:03,306
Asahi!

365
00:21:03,989 --> 00:21:04,586
Left!

366
00:21:06,243 --> 00:21:06,806
Go!

367
00:21:07,149 --> 00:21:08,277
That was great!

368
00:21:11,578 --> 00:21:14,235
Aw, it's all he can do just to return the ball!

369
00:21:14,445 --> 00:21:16,752
Is there any way we could make this go smoother?

370
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:17,557
Go for it!

371
00:21:17,582 --> 00:21:20,933
Not even a pro can be expected
to get a play right the first time.

372
00:21:22,295 --> 00:21:25,193
But every great accomplishment
begins with baby steps, you know?

373
00:21:26,037 --> 00:21:28,525
You remember karasuno's tiny giant, don't you?

374
00:21:28,664 --> 00:21:31,343
Sure, that's the ace Hinata wants to be like.

375
00:21:31,735 --> 00:21:35,412
He lived up to the nickname... Only
stood at about five-foot-five or so...

376
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:37,883
And he kept getting blocked whenever he first started.

377
00:21:38,579 --> 00:21:43,879
But by the second half of his second year, there
was nobody who could compete with him in midair combat.

378
00:21:44,596 --> 00:21:48,345
He couldn't rise above the high blockers,
so he would aim for the gap instead.

379
00:21:48,941 --> 00:21:52,493
Sometimes he would intentionally make
the ball ricochet off their fingertips.

380
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:56,542
And that's how he developed his own
personal style as a smaller player.

381
00:21:57,446 --> 00:22:00,056
Well, that's what I understand
from what my grandpa anyway.

382
00:22:00,186 --> 00:22:02,115
Former coach Ukai said that?

383
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:06,222
Yup, the one and only. And I still
remember his advice like it was yesterday too.

384
00:22:08,637 --> 00:22:10,267
Man has no wings...

385
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:13,347
so he finds his own way to fly.

386
00:22:30,717 --> 00:22:32,837
Aagh! That's an out!

387
00:22:33,832 --> 00:22:35,095
Wow, Shoyo...

388
00:22:36,232 --> 00:22:37,446
That was amazing!

389
00:22:40,926 --> 00:22:41,941
Once more!

390
00:24:13,634 --> 00:24:15,507
The small fry... Hinata, was it?

391
00:24:15,866 --> 00:24:18,248
He was pretty good, even if that last one was out.

392
00:24:18,273 --> 00:24:23,404
Oh no, he's nothing compared to that Inuoka
guy, even though he seemed kinda impressed by us.

393
00:24:23,429 --> 00:24:25,325
Uh, you guys are creeping me out.

394
00:24:25,621 --> 00:24:27,849
Next Haikyu!! "Worthy adversaries."
