1
00:00:03,142 --> 00:00:04,047
One more time!

2
00:00:05,166 --> 00:00:07,268
As soon as he hits the peak of his jump...

3
00:00:07,983 --> 00:00:09,930
The ball needs to meet his palm!

4
00:00:11,733 --> 00:00:14,648
Now I just take aim... And swing!

5
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:51,919
Damn. I sent it a little too high!

6
00:01:53,667 --> 00:01:54,615
Thanks, captain!

7
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,538
Nice job covering Daichi!

8
00:01:57,850 --> 00:01:58,470
It's in!

9
00:01:58,494 --> 00:01:59,284
Front!

10
00:02:00,449 --> 00:02:01,151
Nice one Inuoka!

11
00:02:01,176 --> 00:02:01,838
Over here!

12
00:02:01,862 --> 00:02:02,588
Here you go!

13
00:02:02,943 --> 00:02:06,172
Ready to block, Hinata? One, two, three...

14
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:07,682
Gotcha!

15
00:02:10,197 --> 00:02:11,138
Smooth cover, Kai!

16
00:02:11,163 --> 00:02:14,943
Wow... both of these teams have got some
pretty diligent worker bees, don't they?

17
00:02:15,419 --> 00:02:18,358
They're not flashy, but they
make themselves indispensable.

18
00:02:18,535 --> 00:02:20,481
In the end, they can make or break a game.

19
00:02:21,244 --> 00:02:23,368
Kenma! One more over here!

20
00:02:25,082 --> 00:02:29,591
I don't care who says our offense is no
better than average... I'm the ace of Nekoma!

21
00:02:31,984 --> 00:02:33,582
That's our point!

22
00:02:33,607 --> 00:02:34,289
Dammit!

23
00:02:34,784 --> 00:02:37,992
Look at that! Yamamoto's especially enthusiastic today!

24
00:02:38,318 --> 00:02:42,423
I wonder if he's fired up because there's a
player on their side who reminds him of himself.

25
00:02:42,938 --> 00:02:47,025
Or maybe he's inspired by that vicious
rivalry between Inuoka and that number 10?

26
00:02:48,436 --> 00:02:50,837
What's wrong with Hinata and Kageyama?

27
00:02:51,153 --> 00:02:52,713
Their attacks aren't lining up.

28
00:02:52,969 --> 00:02:58,099
Because they're doing those crazy combo attacks
where Kageyama synchronizes with Hinata's movements...

29
00:02:58,304 --> 00:03:01,500
But now they're trying to execute
normal quick attacks instead.

30
00:03:02,677 --> 00:03:04,902
Hinata needs to work on his technique.

31
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:09,491
And the only way he can do that is
conditioning through repetition.

32
00:03:10,354 --> 00:03:14,847
But if he gets the training and he learns when
to use both kinds of attacks, then eventually...

33
00:03:15,338 --> 00:03:18,193
They won't be a demon and his iron club anymore.

34
00:03:19,225 --> 00:03:21,651
They'll be a demon and a demon!

35
00:03:23,315 --> 00:03:24,319
Serve's up!

36
00:03:28,205 --> 00:03:30,984
Aw, crap! Should I hit it over or underhanded?

37
00:03:31,046 --> 00:03:31,647
Ugh!

38
00:03:31,913 --> 00:03:32,996
Noya, cover!

39
00:03:34,494 --> 00:03:37,698
Aw yeah! The ace might come through in a pinch...

40
00:03:37,723 --> 00:03:40,286
But he's not the only one! Leave it to me!

41
00:03:40,344 --> 00:03:42,156
Hyaaaaa! Gah!

42
00:03:42,181 --> 00:03:42,917
Whoa!

43
00:03:42,942 --> 00:03:44,529
Those guys never stood a chance!

44
00:03:44,554 --> 00:03:49,318
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeahhhh!

45
00:03:52,701 --> 00:03:56,024
I'm not gonna get shut down either! I can do this!

46
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:57,352
Hinata...

47
00:03:57,674 --> 00:03:58,058
Huh?

48
00:03:58,082 --> 00:04:00,468
Kageyama said not to tense up, remember?

49
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:02,103
Keep your eyes open.

50
00:04:02,358 --> 00:04:03,392
Y-yes, sir!

51
00:04:05,647 --> 00:04:06,513
Fukunaga!

52
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:11,972
The buzzcut guy's moving this way! A quick attack!

53
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:13,624
Keep your eyes open.

54
00:04:15,899 --> 00:04:17,334
What's number 7 doing?

55
00:04:22,148 --> 00:04:23,435
Nice one-touch!

56
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:24,419
A chance ball!

57
00:04:25,722 --> 00:04:26,138
Huh?

58
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:27,543
He's quick!

59
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,741
Nekoma's number 7's fast, too!

60
00:04:31,278 --> 00:04:35,416
It's amazing to me how two opponents can
influence each other in moments like this.

61
00:04:35,668 --> 00:04:39,103
Each one continually pushes
the other to new levels of power.

62
00:04:39,803 --> 00:04:42,010
That makes them "worthy adversaries".

63
00:04:44,573 --> 00:04:45,634
He made it through!

64
00:04:45,659 --> 00:04:46,392
He did it!

65
00:04:46,626 --> 00:04:47,765
Oh, heck yeah!

66
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:50,130
Grr... that was still too high.

67
00:04:52,391 --> 00:04:53,436
One more!

68
00:04:55,633 --> 00:04:58,100
Haaaaaaa!

69
00:04:59,644 --> 00:05:00,991
Yeah!

70
00:05:02,704 --> 00:05:05,742
Uh oh... If we're not careful, they might beat us to 20.

71
00:05:06,787 --> 00:05:08,213
It's your serve, Inuoka!

72
00:05:08,589 --> 00:05:09,158
Okay!

73
00:05:10,766 --> 00:05:11,174
Huh?

74
00:05:13,887 --> 00:05:18,659
So when lanky mcspikehead goes to the back
row, then rooster top comes to the front...

75
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:21,442
I liked playing with lanky, but...

76
00:05:22,261 --> 00:05:24,055
This guy's kinda scary.

77
00:05:24,281 --> 00:05:28,512
Inuoka's about 8 inches taller than you are
and you still gave him a run for his money...

78
00:05:28,782 --> 00:05:30,316
Not too bad, small fry.

79
00:05:30,389 --> 00:05:31,094
Ack!

80
00:05:31,119 --> 00:05:31,569
Huh um.

81
00:05:31,656 --> 00:05:33,993
Who you callin' small fry, small fry?!

82
00:05:35,189 --> 00:05:35,752
C'mere.

83
00:05:35,808 --> 00:05:38,332
Ah! Hey, lemme go!

84
00:05:38,389 --> 00:05:40,484
We are going to do the usual move, now.

85
00:05:40,612 --> 00:05:43,256
What? You mean the super hard-hitting one?

86
00:05:43,311 --> 00:05:44,188
That's right.

87
00:05:44,667 --> 00:05:49,414
Aw... can't we stick with the soft one?
I was just starting to get used to it...

88
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,012
Forget it.

89
00:05:50,419 --> 00:05:52,649
We can't do that with him on the front row.

90
00:05:53,329 --> 00:05:53,945
Why can't we?

91
00:05:53,983 --> 00:05:56,998
Because I said, alright?! It's just a hunch.

92
00:05:58,578 --> 00:05:59,616
Put it over!

93
00:06:05,505 --> 00:06:08,816
Awesome! I never get tired of that feeling!

94
00:06:09,177 --> 00:06:11,062
That was a smart choice just now.

95
00:06:11,086 --> 00:06:11,788
Ha?

96
00:06:11,884 --> 00:06:13,073
Hey, that's my bad, guys...

97
00:06:13,098 --> 00:06:17,508
With that third-year middle blocker, I think
their special quick attack is more effective.

98
00:06:17,837 --> 00:06:19,998
If they'd gone with a normal quick attack,

99
00:06:20,286 --> 00:06:23,826
a skilled player like that would've
shut it down without batting an eye.

100
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:28,275
If you looked up "super", you would have a dictionary.
I bet you anything you'd see that kid's picture.

101
00:06:30,004 --> 00:06:32,624
But that doesn't matter. We can still catch up.

102
00:06:34,068 --> 00:06:35,496
Go for it, Hinata!

103
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:39,229
Nice receive!

104
00:06:40,295 --> 00:06:42,971
Wow look at that... Everyone's all jumbled up!

105
00:06:43,114 --> 00:06:44,090
Who's it gonna be?

106
00:06:44,115 --> 00:06:46,636
They should leave it to their
most powerful attacker number 4!

107
00:06:46,661 --> 00:06:48,104
Haaaaaa!

108
00:06:49,266 --> 00:06:50,376
A back row attack!

109
00:06:50,662 --> 00:06:52,552
The front three were a decoy!

110
00:06:52,799 --> 00:06:54,753
They just shook off all our blockers!

111
00:06:57,377 --> 00:06:58,424
That's a chance ball!

112
00:07:00,008 --> 00:07:00,991
Who's gonna get it?

113
00:07:03,595 --> 00:07:04,764
An a-quick!

114
00:07:05,103 --> 00:07:05,988
Wow...

115
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:07,536
That was pretty quick, alright.

116
00:07:07,713 --> 00:07:08,856
Would you look at that?

117
00:07:09,117 --> 00:07:11,586
That attack has got first-rate stability.

118
00:07:12,391 --> 00:07:15,251
Or maybe it just look stable compared to Hinata's moves.

119
00:07:16,367 --> 00:07:17,370
Make it a good one!

120
00:07:18,659 --> 00:07:19,237
Hah!

121
00:07:19,983 --> 00:07:21,423
Ah jeez... Cover!

122
00:07:21,911 --> 00:07:22,694
I'm open!

123
00:07:23,005 --> 00:07:23,829
Asahi!

124
00:07:27,733 --> 00:07:29,231
Who's gonna attack next?!

125
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:30,931
Another a-quick?!

126
00:07:32,417 --> 00:07:33,515
He's not jumping!

127
00:07:38,227 --> 00:07:39,751
What kind of move was that?

128
00:07:40,185 --> 00:07:41,889
That's called a delayed spike...

129
00:07:42,243 --> 00:07:44,512
You pretend that you're gonna jump for a quick.

130
00:07:44,834 --> 00:07:46,615
It throws off the blocker's timing.

131
00:07:47,131 --> 00:07:50,416
That kind of attack has been out of
popularity for a long time though...

132
00:07:51,225 --> 00:07:55,172
I gotta admit I'm impressed they thought to
throw that one in right after their a-quick.

133
00:07:56,078 --> 00:07:56,907
Not bad.

134
00:07:58,412 --> 00:08:00,108
Nekoma made it to 20 points.

135
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:02,950
They're just 5 points away from taking it.

136
00:08:03,407 --> 00:08:04,738
Son of a...

137
00:08:05,127 --> 00:08:07,806
I've already used up both our timeouts and everything.

138
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:13,650
Is that sneaky bastard laughing at me?!

139
00:08:13,675 --> 00:08:14,649
It's crazy.

140
00:08:15,013 --> 00:08:17,544
Ever since their number 1 rotated to the front.

141
00:08:17,568 --> 00:08:21,225
It would appear the proficiency of all
their attacks has been through the roof.

142
00:08:21,329 --> 00:08:23,743
That's true... But look at it this way...

143
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:28,316
With half of our lineup being first-years,
you might consider us a level 1 team...

144
00:08:28,736 --> 00:08:32,109
By that standard, Nekoma's a good 10 or 20 levels higher.

145
00:08:32,302 --> 00:08:33,460
In other words...

146
00:08:33,556 --> 00:08:38,345
They're a full-grown adult feline, and
we're a baby birdie fresh out of the nest.

147
00:08:38,478 --> 00:08:40,158
Exactly. Good metaphor.

148
00:08:42,133 --> 00:08:46,465
They've got a perfect balance of offense
and defense... There's no way we can compete.

149
00:08:47,323 --> 00:08:51,106
At least not today. So... Guess that means...

150
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:54,552
All we can do is persist!

151
00:08:54,768 --> 00:08:57,367
Hit 'em with our full power and don't let up!

152
00:08:57,494 --> 00:09:00,100
So you want us to beat 'em into submission, boss?!

153
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:02,420
Wow, that really makes us sound like the bad guys.

154
00:09:02,445 --> 00:09:06,081
Wahahaha! What's so bad about being the bad guys?!

155
00:09:06,154 --> 00:09:08,639
We'll be just like the crows perched on the gates to hell.

156
00:09:08,664 --> 00:09:11,000
Could you please stop that, coach, you're freaking me out!

157
00:09:11,025 --> 00:09:14,970
Our attacks and receives may be
sloppy... But we're gonna make this happen!

158
00:09:15,436 --> 00:09:19,276
Thes're the weapons we've got right
now, so use 'em the best you can!

159
00:09:19,455 --> 00:09:21,658
Hit 'em with all the artillery we've got!

160
00:09:22,011 --> 00:09:25,077
Hit 'em! Hit 'em... Hit 'em hard!

161
00:09:29,704 --> 00:09:32,165
That was great! Nice block, Tsukishima!

162
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,951
Keep it up, Tsukki!

163
00:09:34,325 --> 00:09:35,501
It's okay, Inuoka.

164
00:09:35,526 --> 00:09:36,224
Sorry...

165
00:09:37,239 --> 00:09:39,234
Karasuno catchin' up to 'em, now.

166
00:09:39,407 --> 00:09:42,649
Yeah, it's pretty close. The mood
of the game has changed entirely.

167
00:09:45,829 --> 00:09:47,324
Anybody gettin' scared, yet?

168
00:09:47,729 --> 00:09:48,396
Nope!

169
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:52,853
Good to hear it... You just keep that ball in play.

170
00:09:52,878 --> 00:09:53,831
Yes, sir!

171
00:10:00,293 --> 00:10:02,796
Okay! Just one more point to tie!

172
00:10:03,033 --> 00:10:04,873
Ah okay you guys keep it up!

173
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:07,082
Can't let 'em score any more.

174
00:10:07,211 --> 00:10:07,877
Right!

175
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:13,423
Oh no!

176
00:10:13,448 --> 00:10:15,265
This wasn't supposed to happen!

177
00:10:15,739 --> 00:10:17,276
They've got match point!

178
00:10:17,954 --> 00:10:18,833
One more point!

179
00:10:18,858 --> 00:10:19,267
Yeah!

180
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:20,080
Dammit...

181
00:10:20,685 --> 00:10:22,696
Look at 'em, they haven't even flinched!

182
00:10:23,676 --> 00:10:25,967
I guess we're not much of a threat to them are we?

183
00:10:26,411 --> 00:10:27,279
It's alright!

184
00:10:28,894 --> 00:10:29,896
We're still sharp.

185
00:10:30,649 --> 00:10:31,742
We can do this.

186
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:52,100
Aw yeah! We clawed our way up to a tie!

187
00:10:53,062 --> 00:10:55,166
Don't get too excited, pal!

188
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:06,337
Grr... Things might get a little trickier
now that their number 3's in the front row.

189
00:11:07,495 --> 00:11:10,610
Our crucial middle blockers
are working at a hundred percent.

190
00:11:11,836 --> 00:11:15,452
Hinata's got the speeding finesse to
score points around their blocker...

191
00:11:16,362 --> 00:11:19,411
And Asahi's our top player when it comes to offense.

192
00:11:21,159 --> 00:11:22,755
With the two of them in the front row...

193
00:11:23,193 --> 00:11:25,726
This is the perfect chance to turn this game around!

194
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:28,815
If we can get a point right now, then it's a deuce.

195
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,508
You're right...

196
00:11:29,774 --> 00:11:33,164
Then they'd have to score another
point, giving us time to turn the tables!

197
00:11:33,254 --> 00:11:34,967
It all depends on this ball!

198
00:11:35,772 --> 00:11:36,635
Nice receive!

199
00:11:37,911 --> 00:11:41,162
Hinata's quick attacks are still shaky. What do I do...?

200
00:11:43,146 --> 00:11:44,103
Come on!

201
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:48,466
Aw, I thought we had it for sure!

202
00:11:48,491 --> 00:11:49,108
Hold on...

203
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:51,328
Here it comes! It's a chance ball!

204
00:11:51,353 --> 00:11:53,055
Agh! My bad, you guys!

205
00:11:53,229 --> 00:11:55,171
Direct spike, Asahi!

206
00:11:55,196 --> 00:11:56,148
No way!

207
00:11:57,687 --> 00:11:58,723
Do it, Asahi!

208
00:11:58,847 --> 00:11:59,596
Yah!

209
00:12:01,173 --> 00:12:02,296
They got it again!

210
00:12:02,742 --> 00:12:05,350
Oh no! It's Karasuno's chance ball again!

211
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:06,738
That's how it goes.

212
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:07,439
Huh?

213
00:12:07,757 --> 00:12:09,312
You can make mistakes...

214
00:12:09,441 --> 00:12:11,688
In fact, you can fail to make an attack at all...

215
00:12:11,852 --> 00:12:15,063
But as long as that ball doesn't
hit the floor, you can't lose.

216
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:16,845
It's a chance ball!

217
00:12:19,663 --> 00:12:21,627
Hinata's so amped right now...

218
00:12:21,894 --> 00:12:23,600
It's just like when I first met him.

219
00:12:25,179 --> 00:12:27,595
He's intense, larger-than-life...

220
00:12:28,637 --> 00:12:32,195
There's nothing he wants more
than the ball out in front of him.

221
00:12:33,763 --> 00:12:35,136
Well, here it comes!

222
00:12:43,551 --> 00:12:44,456
That was it!

223
00:12:48,241 --> 00:12:52,176
The truth is, it's not that
whoever has the best abilities, wins.

224
00:13:00,007 --> 00:13:03,504
It's that whoever lets the ball
fall down on their side, loses.

225
00:13:10,401 --> 00:13:13,638
And that... is what it means to keep the ball in play.

226
00:13:17,103 --> 00:13:18,466
We win!

227
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,968
We didn't make any mistakes the whole time...

228
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:31,076
And we hit them with the best weapons we have.

229
00:13:32,439 --> 00:13:34,452
But still... We couldn't beat 'em.

230
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:40,494
Those Nekoma kids have trained as
a team instead of as individuals.

231
00:13:41,001 --> 00:13:42,291
They deserve this win.

232
00:13:45,005 --> 00:13:46,062
One more time!

233
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:49,258
Another game!

234
00:13:49,419 --> 00:13:50,012
Huh?

235
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,028
Please!

236
00:13:52,256 --> 00:13:54,078
Sure! I was planning on it.

237
00:13:54,901 --> 00:13:58,291
It wouldn't be a practice game if it
wasn't followed by a rematch or two.

238
00:14:00,146 --> 00:14:00,914
Nice one!

239
00:14:01,745 --> 00:14:02,535
Let's go!

240
00:14:03,405 --> 00:14:04,370
One more!

241
00:14:07,134 --> 00:14:09,892
Alright, now we've been thrashed without a doubt.

242
00:14:09,917 --> 00:14:11,987
Yeah we should probably call it a day.

243
00:14:12,453 --> 00:14:13,736
Look how tired they are.

244
00:14:14,366 --> 00:14:15,952
One more match!

245
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:20,726
Again?! You haven't stopped moving since
you got here. Where'd you get all that energy?!

246
00:14:21,187 --> 00:14:22,697
Give 'em a rest, ginger!

247
00:14:22,878 --> 00:14:25,081
If they stay, they're gonna miss the last train!

248
00:14:26,946 --> 00:14:27,808
Circle up!

249
00:14:31,486 --> 00:14:36,553
Actually... your coach Ukai's grandfather
and I have been acquainted for a very long time.

250
00:14:36,891 --> 00:14:40,368
We used to play practice games
with Karasuno every chance we got.

251
00:14:40,725 --> 00:14:43,595
And it was always a pretty close contest back then too.

252
00:14:44,024 --> 00:14:44,571
But then...

253
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,559
Retiring?

254
00:14:47,584 --> 00:14:52,288
Yeah, I'm afraid old age is starting
to catch up with me. Sorry, my friend.

255
00:14:52,697 --> 00:14:53,688
That's too bad...

256
00:14:54,926 --> 00:14:59,756
But hey... either way, I'm sure we won't be
too hard up for opponents for practice games.

257
00:15:04,454 --> 00:15:06,133
The thing about rivals is...

258
00:15:06,981 --> 00:15:08,756
A good one is hard to find.

259
00:15:09,469 --> 00:15:15,185
Poor old Ukai... after he retired, I heard that
he starting to have some serious health problems...

260
00:15:15,731 --> 00:15:18,870
And I was certain Karasuno would
never make a comeback from that.

261
00:15:20,732 --> 00:15:24,554
But you kids have got more potential
than I thought, especially with your offense.

262
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,945
That number 9 and number 10 combo is something else.

263
00:15:28,888 --> 00:15:30,933
That attack's gonna be difficult to beat.

264
00:15:32,201 --> 00:15:35,260
Those left players of yours
are a couple of powerhouses too.

265
00:15:36,578 --> 00:15:39,305
It all comes down to how long you keep the ball in play.

266
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:40,045
Right!

267
00:15:40,847 --> 00:15:46,137
You need a lot more practice working together
as a team, but you've all got outstanding promise.

268
00:15:46,347 --> 00:15:50,238
With the appropriate training, you should
be able to improve by leaps and bounds.

269
00:15:50,723 --> 00:15:53,018
Seeing that really does my old heart good.

270
00:15:54,935 --> 00:15:57,040
I'm glad to have a worthy rival.

271
00:15:58,204 --> 00:16:00,496
I'm sure we'll see you again at the nationals.

272
00:16:01,674 --> 00:16:06,336
In that shining, sprawling gymnasium
packed with thousands of cheering spectators...

273
00:16:06,361 --> 00:16:08,891
Amidst the whirl of excitement and intensity.

274
00:16:09,423 --> 00:16:11,442
The ultimate trashcan showdown...

275
00:16:11,729 --> 00:16:14,264
The real "cats versus crows" faceoff!

276
00:16:14,289 --> 00:16:15,384
Yes, sir!

277
00:16:16,088 --> 00:16:18,727
Alright! Let's get all this stuff put away!

278
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:19,809
Right!

279
00:16:19,927 --> 00:16:21,049
You little turd!

280
00:16:21,074 --> 00:16:22,248
Y-yeah, you are!

281
00:16:22,634 --> 00:16:24,632
Come on, let's pick up the pace!

282
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:26,229
Hey!

283
00:16:28,143 --> 00:16:31,020
Yeah? What the hell do you want, dirtbag?!

284
00:16:31,051 --> 00:16:34,793
You lookin' to get yourself dealt
with?! Come on at me, city boy!

285
00:16:34,907 --> 00:16:39,017
Actually... it's uh... The thing is...

286
00:16:39,124 --> 00:16:39,602
Huh?

287
00:16:40,018 --> 00:16:43,824
Your... your manager... Could you maybe, like...

288
00:16:43,849 --> 00:16:46,051
Could you tell me what your manager's name is?

289
00:16:46,076 --> 00:16:46,591
A-choo.

290
00:16:47,132 --> 00:16:50,000
Grrr... you son of aaahh!

291
00:16:50,025 --> 00:16:54,274
You stay away from her... She is
our manager! If you even look at her...

292
00:16:54,515 --> 00:16:57,318
I'll yank that ugly lint brush right out of your skull!

293
00:16:57,343 --> 00:17:00,700
Don't worry... I'm too much of a coward to talk to her.

294
00:17:01,548 --> 00:17:03,363
Fukunaga, could you mop over there?

295
00:17:03,388 --> 00:17:04,056
Got it.

296
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,423
Yaku, you mop, too.

297
00:17:06,631 --> 00:17:07,908
Okay...

298
00:17:13,189 --> 00:17:13,953
Kiyoko.

299
00:17:14,212 --> 00:17:14,647
Huh!

300
00:17:14,971 --> 00:17:17,207
Her name is Kiyoko Shimizu.

301
00:17:18,115 --> 00:17:21,479
That's perfect! Her name means "clear spring water"!

302
00:17:21,504 --> 00:17:23,617
Yeah, it really does suit her, doesn't it?

303
00:17:23,642 --> 00:17:28,735
It took me a long time to work up the guts, too,
so I know how you feel, but...! Check this out...

304
00:17:29,324 --> 00:17:31,297
You want her to flat-out ignore you...

305
00:17:31,779 --> 00:17:32,770
It's awesome.

306
00:17:33,164 --> 00:17:34,985
Hwaaaaaa!

307
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:37,636
No way, man! I don't think I can handle that!

308
00:17:40,198 --> 00:17:42,927
You know something? You're not so bad, brother!

309
00:17:43,018 --> 00:17:47,822
Huh? Yeah, same to you. I'm uh... Taketora Yamamoto.

310
00:17:48,203 --> 00:17:49,769
And I'm Ryunosuke Tanaka.

311
00:17:50,537 --> 00:17:51,089
Heh.

312
00:17:52,595 --> 00:17:55,401
How long have you been playing volleyball? Who
taught you how to play? How long have you been a setter?

313
00:17:55,426 --> 00:17:58,101
Did you come up with that feint yourself? Have
you been training? Have you ever hit a brick wall?

314
00:17:58,126 --> 00:17:59,399
If so, what did you do about it?

315
00:17:59,615 --> 00:18:02,513
He's growly and scary like a saber-tooth tiger!

316
00:18:02,937 --> 00:18:04,079
That's who he meant.

317
00:18:06,409 --> 00:18:08,297
That was incredible, Shoyo!

318
00:18:08,414 --> 00:18:12,354
"Swoosh!" "Vroom!" "Pow!" Oh, I'm Inuoka, first-year!

319
00:18:12,379 --> 00:18:15,015
And you're really tall, but you ran fast like "zoom!"

320
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,324
And then "kaboom!"

321
00:18:16,349 --> 00:18:18,251
You were so cool when you were like "blam!"

322
00:18:18,276 --> 00:18:20,336
So were you! It was like "sha-ping!"

323
00:18:20,361 --> 00:18:23,315
Thanks! And I've never seen anybody "fwop!" Like that!

324
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:25,243
It wasn't like "fwop!" It was more like a "da-dooom"!

325
00:18:25,268 --> 00:18:27,336
Do you... understand that?

326
00:18:27,507 --> 00:18:29,709
Nah, they sound like a couple of toddlers.

327
00:18:30,607 --> 00:18:35,285
But you know... maybe you should try goofing
off once in a while instead of acting all stoic.

328
00:18:35,323 --> 00:18:37,427
That's not one of my strong suits.

329
00:18:38,646 --> 00:18:39,942
You sound like an old man.

330
00:18:40,737 --> 00:18:43,468
I-I'm so sorry! I should have been moving faster!

331
00:18:43,604 --> 00:18:45,066
What are you apologizing for?

332
00:18:45,138 --> 00:18:47,266
This was all my fault. Please forgive me!

333
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:49,229
Great, he's scaring the first years...

334
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:51,336
They can't see what a softie he is.

335
00:18:51,361 --> 00:18:54,348
In a way, they uh... Kinda look
like father and son from here, huh?

336
00:18:54,544 --> 00:18:56,689
More like a scared kid and his kidnapper.

337
00:19:00,348 --> 00:19:03,495
Um... why is your libero staring at me?

338
00:19:03,792 --> 00:19:04,675
Oh, sorry...

339
00:19:05,303 --> 00:19:07,225
Maybe if you just try to avert
your eyes he'll leave you alone...

340
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:09,630
Hey! I thought your receives were really great!

341
00:19:10,117 --> 00:19:11,935
Our team's ace is pretty strong...

342
00:19:12,207 --> 00:19:15,225
And I've never seen anybody actually
retrieve spikes from him before.

343
00:19:15,417 --> 00:19:19,856
Your team has killer receiving skills and a lot of
that is because you have so much talent as a libero!

344
00:19:20,253 --> 00:19:21,215
So well done!

345
00:19:22,074 --> 00:19:24,527
But I won't lose next time! Count on it!

346
00:19:24,724 --> 00:19:27,189
Ah! Hey... Wait! Let him respond!

347
00:19:28,006 --> 00:19:30,526
Um... sorry, he's kind of intense.

348
00:19:30,872 --> 00:19:32,355
He's dangerous.

349
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:32,761
Huh?

350
00:19:33,072 --> 00:19:37,390
He's got lots of skill as a libero too,
but he doesn't let himself get any rest.

351
00:19:37,462 --> 00:19:39,845
He just keeps going, looking onward and upward.

352
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:41,792
So he's a threat.

353
00:19:43,448 --> 00:19:44,599
Coach Nekomata!

354
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:47,457
Thank you for making such a long trip to play with us.

355
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:49,608
Not at all, it was my pleasure.

356
00:19:53,028 --> 00:19:57,428
I'm sure it's hard to get someone to play
practice games with when you don't have connections.

357
00:19:58,441 --> 00:20:00,354
You had my phone ringing off the hook!

358
00:20:00,569 --> 00:20:03,815
And at one point you even threatened
to come irritate me in person!

359
00:20:05,265 --> 00:20:06,645
I-I'm sorry!

360
00:20:07,147 --> 00:20:10,251
Anyway... enthusiasm breeds more enthusiasm.

361
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:12,410
You don't have much experience, yet...

362
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:15,571
But keep your nose to the
grindstone, and the kids'll follow you.

363
00:20:16,197 --> 00:20:16,904
Good work.

364
00:20:18,519 --> 00:20:20,329
Thank you so much, sir!

365
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:25,317
I want to see you get it together, too, Keishin...

366
00:20:25,604 --> 00:20:29,216
After all, we played three games
today and you didn't take a single set.

367
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:32,984
Then next time we play, I'll
kick your ass in every set, old man.

368
00:20:33,694 --> 00:20:37,876
Ooooh? Is that so? Well, I think you're full of hot air.

369
00:20:38,464 --> 00:20:40,257
P-please don't provoke him, coach...

370
00:20:40,282 --> 00:20:42,790
It's his own fault he looks just like his gramps!

371
00:20:42,821 --> 00:20:44,312
That makes no sense!

372
00:20:45,413 --> 00:20:46,612
Ah uh hang on!

373
00:20:46,702 --> 00:20:49,753
I thought you said you'd only
stay on as coach for the Nekoma game-

374
00:20:49,792 --> 00:20:51,958
You expect me to take that lying down?!

375
00:20:51,983 --> 00:20:52,409
Ah?

376
00:20:52,797 --> 00:20:55,874
I'll get revenge in a big venue with a crowd watching!

377
00:21:00,178 --> 00:21:02,413
We'll be reunited soon, comrade!

378
00:21:03,153 --> 00:21:04,583
Okay... that's weird.

379
00:21:04,621 --> 00:21:06,659
Yeah I know... Just don't look.

380
00:21:10,827 --> 00:21:12,153
You won't win next time.

381
00:21:12,178 --> 00:21:14,494
Oh really? Because I think I will.

382
00:21:14,581 --> 00:21:16,365
Cut it out. You're being weird!

383
00:21:16,437 --> 00:21:19,124
The next practice game isn't gonna go down like that!

384
00:21:19,156 --> 00:21:22,013
Good, otherwise it's not much of a practice game, is it?!

385
00:21:22,038 --> 00:21:22,848
Not them too!

386
00:21:22,873 --> 00:21:24,286
Hey come on, really?!

387
00:21:25,081 --> 00:21:25,758
Kenma!

388
00:21:26,986 --> 00:21:27,742
Shoyo.

389
00:21:28,509 --> 00:21:30,196
When I first met you on the street...

390
00:21:30,545 --> 00:21:33,246
You said you didn't really
like volleyball that much, right?

391
00:21:33,558 --> 00:21:35,113
Oh... yeah.

392
00:21:35,664 --> 00:21:38,290
How about now? Didn't it feel good to win?

393
00:21:41,753 --> 00:21:44,329
Eh... it was the same as always.

394
00:21:47,144 --> 00:21:48,051
Next time...

395
00:21:49,026 --> 00:21:50,976
I'll make you want to win really bad...

396
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:53,116
And then we'll win!

397
00:21:54,564 --> 00:21:55,317
And then...

398
00:21:55,697 --> 00:22:00,313
you'll say "Man, that was a blast! I hate losing!"
And the way you talk about the game'll change for good.

399
00:22:00,338 --> 00:22:00,933
Huh...

400
00:22:02,519 --> 00:22:03,240
Cool...

401
00:22:04,195 --> 00:22:05,914
Well... I'll be waiting.

402
00:23:37,676 --> 00:23:39,189
If that had been a real match...

403
00:23:39,673 --> 00:23:40,141
Hum?

404
00:23:41,669 --> 00:23:42,672
We'd have been done...

405
00:23:43,286 --> 00:23:46,294
As soon as we lost that first game... that's it.

406
00:23:52,186 --> 00:23:53,178
Yeah, I know.

407
00:23:54,556 --> 00:23:56,260
It's good to know you've thought about it.

408
00:23:56,285 --> 00:23:56,953
Huh?

409
00:23:57,411 --> 00:23:59,391
We do have a real game coming up...

410
00:23:59,576 --> 00:24:01,701
The Inter-High Preliminaries, remember?

411
00:24:02,819 --> 00:24:04,135
Now let's hurry back home...

412
00:24:04,682 --> 00:24:07,619
We need to do some serious
thinking about today's practice game.

413
00:24:07,795 --> 00:24:09,447
Then we get back to work!

414
00:24:09,993 --> 00:24:10,982
Yes, sir!

415
00:24:14,428 --> 00:24:18,868
By the way, Kageyama, did you ask their setter
about that technique where he feints with his eyes?

416
00:24:18,893 --> 00:24:19,372
No.

417
00:24:19,396 --> 00:24:20,241
Awww...

418
00:24:20,437 --> 00:24:22,075
Were you too shy to talk to him or what?

419
00:24:22,099 --> 00:24:22,798
What did you say to me?!

420
00:24:22,822 --> 00:24:24,774
Awoooo. Jeez it was just a question!

421
00:24:24,798 --> 00:24:27,285
Next Haikyu!! "The tough opponents"!
