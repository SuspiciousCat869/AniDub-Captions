1
00:00:04,288 --> 00:00:05,267
Damn!

2
00:00:11,169 --> 00:00:12,257
Whoa! It's up!

3
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:13,851
Nice follow-thru!

4
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:18,633
You have to ask the setter for
another chance, Asahi! You're the ace!

5
00:00:19,986 --> 00:00:20,559
Shimada!

6
00:00:20,584 --> 00:00:25,577
Sugaaaaaaaaaaaaa!

7
00:00:25,935 --> 00:00:27,077
Over here!

8
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:28,183
Asahi!

9
00:00:48,037 --> 00:00:51,302
Did you just hear that noise?! It was like blahw!

10
00:00:51,564 --> 00:00:54,473
Nice one! You should be proud! Both of you!

11
00:00:55,292 --> 00:01:00,573
Thanks a lot... uh great ball... Suga...
and Nishinoya's receive was perfect.

12
00:01:05,979 --> 00:01:08,240
So... that's the ace.

13
00:01:09,837 --> 00:01:10,275
Hey.

14
00:01:10,363 --> 00:01:10,775
Hm?

15
00:01:11,291 --> 00:01:13,547
I know you wanted to see the ace and everything...

16
00:01:14,034 --> 00:01:15,129
But don't freak out!

17
00:01:15,154 --> 00:01:17,074
What?! I-I'm not freaking out!

18
00:01:17,532 --> 00:01:20,887
I may not be as tall or strong
as him, but I've got spirit!

19
00:01:22,576 --> 00:01:24,461
Next ace... is me!

20
00:02:57,479 --> 00:03:00,560
The average hand is approximately
3 quarters of an inch thick...

21
00:03:00,974 --> 00:03:04,006
I have slightly smaller hands
than most people in my age group...

22
00:03:05,108 --> 00:03:08,100
But that three-fourths of an inch
between the ball and the floor...

23
00:03:09,118 --> 00:03:11,083
Makes all the difference in the world...

24
00:03:13,811 --> 00:03:15,488
to keep the ace alive.

25
00:03:19,874 --> 00:03:24,187
This is what happens when you skip club
for a month! You can't jump worth a crap!

26
00:03:25,119 --> 00:03:25,951
I'm sorry.

27
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:28,183
Haha, don't you think that's a bit harsh?

28
00:03:29,434 --> 00:03:30,535
Reunited!

29
00:03:32,061 --> 00:03:37,002
So not only are we up against a veteran
team from the association but Asahi's with them?

30
00:03:37,251 --> 00:03:39,423
We've sure got our work cut out for us now.

31
00:03:41,737 --> 00:03:44,168
What are you going on about, Daichi?
You know you've got me on your side...

32
00:03:44,193 --> 00:03:45,702
You've got me on your side!

33
00:03:45,734 --> 00:03:46,577
Uh... What?

34
00:03:46,987 --> 00:03:52,865
Hinata! Mind your own business! I was just about to be
a badass and then you popped up and ruined everything!

35
00:03:53,133 --> 00:03:56,568
That was freakin' incredible! Nishinoya's like a pro!

36
00:03:56,674 --> 00:04:00,201
If we can retrieve blocked balls,
then we'll be unstoppable for sure!

37
00:04:00,447 --> 00:04:04,399
Don't bank on that... He's not
gonna be able to do it every time.

38
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:05,182
Huh?

39
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:08,790
The ball falls downward at a speed of 60 miles an hour.

40
00:04:08,901 --> 00:04:13,577
And that's from just 6 to 8 feet away.
Nobody could save all of them. It's impossible.

41
00:04:13,866 --> 00:04:15,017
Oh.

42
00:04:15,321 --> 00:04:15,848
Listen...

43
00:04:16,483 --> 00:04:21,268
The best thing we can do is get it into these boys'
heads that a blocked ball isn't the end of the world.

44
00:04:21,651 --> 00:04:24,447
Just keep getting blocked and
I'll get every single one of 'em!

45
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:24,916
Huh?

46
00:04:24,955 --> 00:04:29,189
Once you figure out that your teammates have
your back, Your frame of mind totally changes.

47
00:04:29,421 --> 00:04:30,558
Go for it!

48
00:04:31,185 --> 00:04:31,854
Ennoshita!

49
00:04:33,603 --> 00:04:34,443
Cover it!

50
00:04:34,624 --> 00:04:37,192
They could stand to work on their receives as a team.

51
00:04:37,864 --> 00:04:38,406
Got it!

52
00:04:38,753 --> 00:04:41,968
That setter's got a knack for gauging
distance from the point of impact.

53
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:44,851
If I remember right, he's a first-year.

54
00:04:45,667 --> 00:04:47,315
Wonder which setter I'll use...

55
00:04:52,737 --> 00:04:54,338
That's what I'm talkin' about!

56
00:04:54,363 --> 00:04:55,068
Thanks!

57
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:01,170
It's all thanks to Kageyama's
sets... I can get past anybody now!

58
00:05:01,552 --> 00:05:04,648
Oh wow, I guess he wasn't
kidding around when he told me that.

59
00:05:05,024 --> 00:05:09,407
Dude, that was unbelievable! How'd
you do that?! I couldn't look away!

60
00:05:12,042 --> 00:05:14,405
They didn't give each other any kind of signal...

61
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:16,126
How did they time it so well?

62
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:19,116
You!

63
00:05:20,773 --> 00:05:23,084
What made you jump over there... huh, ginger?!

64
00:05:23,109 --> 00:05:23,522
Huh?!

65
00:05:24,851 --> 00:05:28,548
Uh... 'Cause it'll come to me wherever I am... uh, sir!

66
00:05:30,138 --> 00:05:33,498
The shorty obviously jumped
without even looking for the ball.

67
00:05:34,892 --> 00:05:39,131
Does that first-year setter automatically
adapt to everything the little guy does?

68
00:05:40,472 --> 00:05:43,172
How's that kid so sure that the set is coming?

69
00:05:43,703 --> 00:05:47,926
Who in their right mind goes full-swing on
something like that without even a glance.

70
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:50,437
What are you guys, a couple of weirdos?!

71
00:05:51,754 --> 00:05:52,781
Weirdos?

72
00:05:53,539 --> 00:05:54,363
Are we?

73
00:05:54,411 --> 00:05:55,196
I dunno.

74
00:05:56,618 --> 00:05:57,166
Wipe that smirk off your face, Tsukishima!

75
00:05:57,191 --> 00:06:00,930
I have no what those two have going
on, but I'm not going to discourage it.

76
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:04,989
So... I was content to just hide in Kageyama's shadow...

77
00:06:06,194 --> 00:06:08,146
It was... easier.

78
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:12,109
Man, that first-year setter's gotta be
some kinda mutant prodigy or something.

79
00:06:12,355 --> 00:06:12,742
Okay!

80
00:06:12,767 --> 00:06:15,747
In fact, he seems like he's got superhuman abilities.

81
00:06:15,914 --> 00:06:16,600
Still...

82
00:06:19,534 --> 00:06:20,931
Ooh! Straight spike!

83
00:06:20,956 --> 00:06:24,482
And this is after he's been out
for a month, marvelous bastard!

84
00:06:24,513 --> 00:06:26,440
You are way too excited.

85
00:06:26,762 --> 00:06:29,588
That split-second timing between the toss and the spike...

86
00:06:30,209 --> 00:06:34,474
It's the kind of thing that can only be accomplished after
you've been through a whole hell of a lot of training.

87
00:06:34,836 --> 00:06:35,338
Yes!

88
00:06:35,362 --> 00:06:35,915
Yes!

89
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:38,798
A bond of trust like they have can't be built in a day.

90
00:06:39,632 --> 00:06:42,117
We have a first-year setter with amazing talent...

91
00:06:42,405 --> 00:06:46,773
And another pair with an incredible
connection with each other. We have weapons.

92
00:06:52,632 --> 00:06:53,290
I'm free!

93
00:06:54,853 --> 00:06:56,983
This ain't a bad team you've got here!

94
00:06:57,879 --> 00:06:59,582
Why didn't you tell me, specs?

95
00:07:00,482 --> 00:07:02,983
Yeah I've told you several times, actually.

96
00:07:08,215 --> 00:07:09,368
But the ginger...

97
00:07:09,538 --> 00:07:12,053
I don't understand why he's a middle blocker...

98
00:07:12,376 --> 00:07:15,932
He's got pretty good quick attacks,
but can that peewee actually block?

99
00:07:19,746 --> 00:07:21,058
He's staring at me...

100
00:07:21,535 --> 00:07:23,592
Oh... that's right, I forgot!

101
00:07:23,736 --> 00:07:26,914
This is Hinata's chance to go
head-to-head with the current ace.

102
00:07:26,939 --> 00:07:27,393
Huh?

103
00:07:27,964 --> 00:07:33,647
The thing is... Hinata enrolled at Karasuno
because he wants to be just like the tiny giant.

104
00:07:33,824 --> 00:07:37,272
Yeah. That's right. That little guy was an ace too.

105
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:41,180
That's why he's always so fired
up... he's trying to be the same thing.

106
00:07:41,987 --> 00:07:46,248
This'll be huge for him... A chance for
him to test his abilities against Asahi.

107
00:07:46,615 --> 00:07:51,286
Heh, well isn't that special? Although
it's kinda like a kid against a grown man.

108
00:07:54,127 --> 00:07:55,513
Parallel ball.

109
00:07:56,708 --> 00:07:59,407
I can't believe I'm marking the ace right now.

110
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:02,071
The ace of Karasuno High School!

111
00:08:02,943 --> 00:08:03,937
Get ready!

112
00:08:05,664 --> 00:08:06,401
Nice receive!

113
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:11,707
It only took him a split-second to catch me!

114
00:08:18,949 --> 00:08:20,791
I knew how high that kid could jump...

115
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:26,307
But it's amazing to see it at eye level. I
mean, how is something like that even possible?

116
00:08:28,787 --> 00:08:32,453
He's great... and he's been out for a whole month!

117
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:35,495
You've been holding your hands in
the wrong position when you block...

118
00:08:35,595 --> 00:08:38,395
This how you do it here! Like this!

119
00:08:39,426 --> 00:08:41,716
Are you listening? Look at me!

120
00:08:41,741 --> 00:08:43,098
Let's keep it up, you guys.

121
00:08:47,603 --> 00:08:51,067
He was always covered in sweat
and looked like he was hurting...

122
00:08:51,624 --> 00:08:54,094
But the tiny giant never stopped jumping.

123
00:08:54,683 --> 00:08:56,676
I didn't really understand it at the time...

124
00:08:57,496 --> 00:09:01,808
But I think that's what it means to be in a
position where your teammates completely depend on you.

125
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:05,829
Everybody on the team had faith
that he could score the point...

126
00:09:07,058 --> 00:09:09,683
So they did everything they
could to get the ball over to him.

127
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:13,305
That must be what it's like to be Asahi too.

128
00:09:15,352 --> 00:09:15,915
Hey.

129
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,334
The ace is awesome!

130
00:09:17,561 --> 00:09:21,948
Even if they're blocking him, it doesn't matter
'cause he's got enough power to break right through 'em!

131
00:09:23,817 --> 00:09:24,341
What?

132
00:09:25,753 --> 00:09:26,598
Nothing.

133
00:09:27,553 --> 00:09:28,211
Hm?

134
00:09:29,634 --> 00:09:30,218
Forward!

135
00:09:30,242 --> 00:09:30,943
Cover it!

136
00:09:30,968 --> 00:09:32,223
Hey, left side!

137
00:09:32,915 --> 00:09:35,682
If I was tall and powerful, I could be just like him...

138
00:09:35,707 --> 00:09:37,588
Hinata, move closer to the back!

139
00:09:37,613 --> 00:09:41,474
No! The tiny giant was amazing
without being tall! But still...

140
00:09:45,207 --> 00:09:46,016
I wish...

141
00:09:46,459 --> 00:09:47,349
Hinata!

142
00:09:50,296 --> 00:09:51,005
Gahh!

143
00:10:00,197 --> 00:10:01,142
Hinata!

144
00:10:03,167 --> 00:10:04,446
Well, he's alive.

145
00:10:04,471 --> 00:10:05,622
Are you okay?

146
00:10:06,078 --> 00:10:09,426
You shouldn't feel bad, it's his
fault for spacing out like an idiot.

147
00:10:11,105 --> 00:10:12,962
It's gonna be okay, specs.

148
00:10:13,101 --> 00:10:15,505
Uh... sorry, guys... I'm okay.

149
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:17,533
Are you sure? Maybe you'd better sit out a bit-

150
00:10:17,558 --> 00:10:22,154
I swear I'm okay! Don't worry about me. I just
didn't move out of the way fast enough, that's all.

151
00:10:22,179 --> 00:10:23,997
I get hit in the face a lot.

152
00:10:24,063 --> 00:10:25,516
Uh, that's not good...

153
00:10:28,815 --> 00:10:29,354
Huh?

154
00:10:37,113 --> 00:10:38,865
It's the middle of a game.

155
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:41,754
What could you possibly be spacing out about.

156
00:10:45,616 --> 00:10:50,478
Oh crap. Kageyama's not yelling...
which means he's really mad.

157
00:10:50,503 --> 00:10:53,195
This is just like that time I
hit him in the head with the ball.

158
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,506
I know what it is.

159
00:10:56,309 --> 00:10:58,131
You wish you were the ace, don't you...

160
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:02,070
You don't want to just be the
team decoy... you think it's lame.

161
00:11:02,356 --> 00:11:07,487
You want to be as big and as important as
Asahi so you can be the ace instead, am I right?

162
00:11:07,978 --> 00:11:09,475
That's not how I feel!

163
00:11:10,988 --> 00:11:13,440
Well... uh... maybe...

164
00:11:15,095 --> 00:11:17,048
Now that you know we have an ace...

165
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:20,519
It's not just something you dream about... you're jealous!

166
00:11:23,229 --> 00:11:26,009
Think about that garbage on your own time from now on!

167
00:11:28,536 --> 00:11:30,042
Okay, so I'm jealous...

168
00:11:30,454 --> 00:11:31,726
Is that so awful?

169
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:36,203
How could you understand how I
feel? You've always been really tall!

170
00:11:38,539 --> 00:11:39,166
Look.

171
00:11:39,442 --> 00:11:41,026
Heys, uh fellas!

172
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:45,104
It's time to close down the gym
for the night... put your stuff away.

173
00:11:45,129 --> 00:11:47,303
I'm sorry, sir! Our game's not over yet.

174
00:11:47,651 --> 00:11:49,043
Do you know what time it is?

175
00:11:49,068 --> 00:11:50,758
Yes, I'll be sure to lock up.

176
00:11:53,677 --> 00:11:58,436
It's my fault for holding up
the game. And now Kageyama's mad.

177
00:11:59,686 --> 00:12:00,486
Don't doddle.

178
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:02,216
Thanks, sorry to bother you.

179
00:12:03,285 --> 00:12:05,823
Sorry, Takeda! We'll hurry it up.

180
00:12:07,122 --> 00:12:08,404
You tell 'em, Take!

181
00:12:08,793 --> 00:12:11,124
Right... let's pick up where we left off!

182
00:12:11,149 --> 00:12:12,179
Yes sir!

183
00:12:13,011 --> 00:12:13,784
One more!

184
00:12:13,809 --> 00:12:14,720
Let's go!

185
00:12:14,887 --> 00:12:17,056
Hope you punks are ready!

186
00:12:17,693 --> 00:12:22,514
Hey... based on what we've seen so far, it looks
like the high schoolers are in their best rotation now.

187
00:12:22,937 --> 00:12:25,606
We better keep our eyes peeled
for the shorty's quick attack.

188
00:12:25,631 --> 00:12:26,176
Yeah.

189
00:12:26,335 --> 00:12:26,902
Listen.

190
00:12:26,965 --> 00:12:27,434
Hm?

191
00:12:29,793 --> 00:12:32,248
My next set... goes straight to this guy.

192
00:12:33,048 --> 00:12:34,885
Block him with all you've got.

193
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:55,122
Yeah... I'm gonna send it to him...
just thought you should know that.

194
00:12:56,372 --> 00:12:58,353
Oh yeah? You daring us?

195
00:12:58,378 --> 00:13:02,162
Sure. Call it what you want... But it's going to Hinata.

196
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:06,395
Haaaa! You're funny, kid! That's really good!

197
00:13:07,072 --> 00:13:09,242
Alright... thanks for the heads up.

198
00:13:09,655 --> 00:13:10,593
You're welcome.

199
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:21,801
Is he crazy? The whole point of a quick attack is
the fact that your opponent's not expecting it...

200
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:27,082
So there's no way ginger can get through a head-on
block now... Not with all the cards on the table!

201
00:13:27,993 --> 00:13:28,927
I agree.

202
00:13:29,347 --> 00:13:32,821
His height already gives him a
disadvantage with blockers as it is.

203
00:13:33,612 --> 00:13:35,743
What the heck is Kageyama's problem?

204
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,231
Why'd he have to give our plan away?

205
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:42,452
Those blockers are way too big for me to spike through!

206
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:49,925
All you are now... Is a clumsy little turd
who just happens to be fast and good at jumping.

207
00:13:50,229 --> 00:13:53,079
Someone like you could never be the ace of this team.

208
00:13:54,107 --> 00:13:54,684
Hey now.

209
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:55,545
That's not cool.

210
00:13:56,011 --> 00:13:56,532
But...

211
00:13:57,690 --> 00:13:59,782
With me around, you are the greatest!

212
00:13:59,807 --> 00:14:00,393
What?

213
00:14:01,736 --> 00:14:06,463
Look at Asahi. His spikes are forceful
enough to cut straight through a triple block.

214
00:14:06,488 --> 00:14:09,027
Huh?! W-well not every time, but uh...

215
00:14:09,052 --> 00:14:10,436
Whoa, calm it down, buddy!

216
00:14:10,461 --> 00:14:12,168
You might not have what he does...

217
00:14:12,193 --> 00:14:16,049
But how often do you really get
blocked? When you hit one of my sets?

218
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:16,917
Hm?

219
00:14:20,131 --> 00:14:20,836
Go for it!

220
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:22,106
I got it!

221
00:14:22,435 --> 00:14:23,385
Nice receive!

222
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:25,808
They're too tall...

223
00:14:26,024 --> 00:14:26,905
Go around!

224
00:14:27,647 --> 00:14:30,168
What other option do you have, you idiot?!

225
00:14:33,344 --> 00:14:34,600
If you can't get through...

226
00:14:35,843 --> 00:14:36,788
go around!

227
00:14:40,811 --> 00:14:42,213
I hate being blocked.

228
00:14:42,574 --> 00:14:44,025
I hate being pushed back!

229
00:14:46,312 --> 00:14:49,096
I don't have a chance of winning
with these blockers in my way.

230
00:14:50,867 --> 00:14:52,981
I can't break through them like the ace does.

231
00:14:55,216 --> 00:14:55,708
But...

232
00:14:57,992 --> 00:14:59,069
With me around...

233
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:05,635
you... are the greatest!

234
00:15:13,864 --> 00:15:15,649
You might not be the ace of this team...

235
00:15:16,026 --> 00:15:18,739
But with your speed and jumps... and my sets...

236
00:15:18,764 --> 00:15:20,456
You can take on anybody!

237
00:15:21,674 --> 00:15:25,723
The ace powers through for a
point, and you dodge for yours.

238
00:15:26,636 --> 00:15:28,178
But a point is a point!

239
00:15:28,606 --> 00:15:30,911
You don't need a crown with "ace" written on it!

240
00:15:31,062 --> 00:15:33,286
You just need you to score all you can!

241
00:15:33,827 --> 00:15:35,995
That's why our opponents will be marking you!

242
00:15:36,198 --> 00:15:41,820
Your decoy skills will free up our other
spikers to score points too... Including the ace!

243
00:15:42,593 --> 00:15:43,153
Right?!

244
00:15:43,412 --> 00:15:44,058
Uh-huh!

245
00:15:44,372 --> 00:15:46,221
Look this guy is right, you know!

246
00:15:46,308 --> 00:15:49,936
Having you as a decoy could make a major
difference in our success rate every game!

247
00:15:49,961 --> 00:15:51,098
It's an advantage.

248
00:15:51,568 --> 00:15:52,783
So tell me, Hinata...

249
00:15:53,106 --> 00:15:56,042
Do you still feel like the job of a decoy is useless?!

250
00:16:08,544 --> 00:16:09,286
No.

251
00:16:09,462 --> 00:16:10,103
Huh?!

252
00:16:11,738 --> 00:16:13,139
Of course it isn't!

253
00:16:14,617 --> 00:16:15,236
Good!

254
00:16:21,153 --> 00:16:23,237
That last hit you did... It was great.

255
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:28,025
I'm sorry for interrupting the practice game, sir!

256
00:16:28,176 --> 00:16:29,306
Oh... That's... uhh...

257
00:16:29,331 --> 00:16:30,562
Yeah, sorry!

258
00:16:30,775 --> 00:16:31,989
If it's okay with you...

259
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:33,397
Let's keep playing!

260
00:16:33,486 --> 00:16:35,854
Alright! We're gonna catch right up!

261
00:16:35,956 --> 00:16:36,696
Yeah.

262
00:16:38,652 --> 00:16:39,591
Hey, specs.

263
00:16:39,615 --> 00:16:40,017
Huh?

264
00:16:40,042 --> 00:16:40,688
Anyway, just because you happened to nail it that time-

265
00:16:40,713 --> 00:16:41,747
Those two there.

266
00:16:42,428 --> 00:16:44,479
You mean Hinata and Kageyama?

267
00:16:45,168 --> 00:16:46,879
Did they meet during middle school?

268
00:16:46,904 --> 00:16:49,273
Or were the two of 'em close in
elementary school or something?

269
00:16:49,298 --> 00:16:53,559
Huh? Oh not at all, actually the
two of them just met recently...

270
00:16:53,669 --> 00:16:56,595
We had a lot of trouble with them at
first because they didn't get along.

271
00:16:57,005 --> 00:16:57,495
Hm.

272
00:16:57,582 --> 00:16:59,170
Um, why do you ask?

273
00:17:00,838 --> 00:17:01,927
Whaddya know.

274
00:17:05,929 --> 00:17:08,155
These high schoolers really know their stuff...

275
00:17:08,413 --> 00:17:10,682
I think we're gonna have to kick it up a notch.

276
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:14,997
A jump float!

277
00:17:16,063 --> 00:17:16,889
Hinata!

278
00:17:16,914 --> 00:17:18,484
Alright, I'm open!

279
00:17:19,887 --> 00:17:20,328
Uh?!

280
00:17:22,824 --> 00:17:23,913
Face plant!

281
00:17:23,938 --> 00:17:25,524
You are kind of a jerk.

282
00:17:25,549 --> 00:17:26,434
Hmmm?

283
00:17:27,096 --> 00:17:31,367
Hey... I've never seen a serve like that.
Didn't seem to have much momentum on it.

284
00:17:31,482 --> 00:17:33,220
That's called a jump float serve.

285
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:36,317
Without any spin, it's got a shaky trajectory.

286
00:17:36,776 --> 00:17:38,892
It could swerve or drop at any second.

287
00:17:39,061 --> 00:17:42,339
Ah... It's like a knuckle ball... Interesting!

288
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:46,344
Uh Tadashi... they just got a point.

289
00:17:46,991 --> 00:17:48,609
Oh, I'm so sorry.

290
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:50,802
One more!

291
00:17:52,129 --> 00:17:52,622
Whoa!

292
00:17:59,226 --> 00:17:59,523
Excellent!

293
00:17:59,547 --> 00:18:00,634
That's four in a row.

294
00:18:00,658 --> 00:18:01,487
Sweet!

295
00:18:01,641 --> 00:18:04,445
Those two first years have a good combo worked out...

296
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:06,443
But the receivers do need some work...

297
00:18:06,793 --> 00:18:08,078
Make sure to write that down.

298
00:18:08,467 --> 00:18:10,798
Heh. You kids are all mine now!

299
00:18:14,153 --> 00:18:14,776
Nice receive!

300
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,542
You're not gonna get away with it again, short pants!

301
00:18:18,705 --> 00:18:19,754
Ha! Gotcha!

302
00:18:21,563 --> 00:18:22,271
Uh-oh!

303
00:18:23,081 --> 00:18:25,320
'Sup, scrubs?! Remember me?!

304
00:18:25,614 --> 00:18:26,325
What?!

305
00:18:27,428 --> 00:18:28,365
Nice save!

306
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,198
Suga!

307
00:18:31,175 --> 00:18:31,933
Asahi!

308
00:18:45,037 --> 00:18:49,858
Aw man! My bad, dude! They weren't
even trying to mark me either were they?!

309
00:18:49,883 --> 00:18:50,873
Oh! No!

310
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:54,958
That was awesome though... You must've had
every set of eyes on you by the end of it...

311
00:18:55,194 --> 00:18:56,934
Must say I'm a little jealous of you.

312
00:18:57,875 --> 00:18:59,012
Keep it up next game!

313
00:18:59,037 --> 00:19:01,111
Ah... um... Okay!

314
00:19:03,492 --> 00:19:06,824
Man, that game made me feel like I was in school again!

315
00:19:07,204 --> 00:19:11,305
Those were some good times right?
All the girls! All the drama...

316
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:15,475
"With me around, you're the greatest!"? You
kiddin? I wish I could say crap like that...

317
00:19:15,782 --> 00:19:17,535
Man, high school was fun.

318
00:19:19,727 --> 00:19:22,733
You kids really made us feel like some dinosaurs in there.

319
00:19:22,758 --> 00:19:24,139
Uh... Sorry, sir.

320
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:28,617
Well anyway... you might not have
everything figured out just yet...

321
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:32,399
But once you do, I think you guys
are really going places. I mean it.

322
00:19:34,832 --> 00:19:35,986
Thank you for coming!

323
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:37,368
Thank you!

324
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:44,022
Okay. Receiving... that's the biggest issue right now.

325
00:19:44,846 --> 00:19:46,836
So we'll be working on that tomorrow!

326
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:48,118
Yes sir!

327
00:19:49,038 --> 00:19:49,866
Thank you!

328
00:19:49,941 --> 00:19:50,909
Thank you!

329
00:19:50,934 --> 00:19:53,117
Now... don't forget to stretch.

330
00:19:53,142 --> 00:19:54,366
Let's stretch out guys!

331
00:19:54,391 --> 00:19:55,350
Yes sir!

332
00:19:57,552 --> 00:19:59,227
Rotations! 1, 2, 3, 4...

333
00:19:59,252 --> 00:20:01,251
Is their receiving really that awful?

334
00:20:01,869 --> 00:20:03,077
You seem stressed out.

335
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:05,923
No... that's not what I'm worried about most.

336
00:20:06,922 --> 00:20:11,712
I never really thought about it that hard when I
was up for selection during my time in high school...

337
00:20:12,659 --> 00:20:15,442
But the guy doing the selecting
has his work cut out for him.

338
00:20:18,341 --> 00:20:19,475
Let's put all this away!

339
00:20:19,499 --> 00:20:20,241
Yes sir!

340
00:20:20,988 --> 00:20:22,922
Yamaguchi, bring the balls over there...

341
00:20:22,946 --> 00:20:23,536
Coming!

342
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:24,516
Asahi?

343
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:25,191
Hm?

344
00:20:26,417 --> 00:20:28,040
Let's pick up the pace, everybody!

345
00:20:28,842 --> 00:20:30,179
I may not be the ace...

346
00:20:30,882 --> 00:20:33,674
but I am one of the guys who clears the way for the ace...

347
00:20:34,611 --> 00:20:36,930
I'm a great decoy... The best!

348
00:20:40,525 --> 00:20:44,255
Ah! But I can't really do that without Kageyama's sets...

349
00:20:45,174 --> 00:20:47,968
So... what I'm saying is...

350
00:20:48,162 --> 00:20:52,708
"I'll do my best" sounds kinda cheesy... But
"let's do our best" sounds even worse, so...

351
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:54,472
Hinata?

352
00:20:54,849 --> 00:20:55,202
Hm?

353
00:20:56,003 --> 00:20:58,340
That is... your name, right?

354
00:20:59,159 --> 00:21:05,050
Listen, "ace" is just another name for a wing
spiker in left position... you do understand that, right?

355
00:21:05,184 --> 00:21:05,893
Uh-huh.

356
00:21:06,154 --> 00:21:08,500
When it comes to breaking through a triple block...

357
00:21:08,734 --> 00:21:13,720
Or hitting the ball when the timing's tight...
those things are definitely the ace's job...

358
00:21:14,881 --> 00:21:19,563
With your speed and jumps... and
my sets... you can take on anybody!

359
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:26,008
But still, to have a setter say something like that about
you... Well, that's pretty impressive in and of itself.

360
00:21:26,043 --> 00:21:26,567
Huh?

361
00:21:27,598 --> 00:21:29,473
A-anyway... I guess...

362
00:21:29,498 --> 00:21:33,484
What I'm trying to say is... Whether
you're a decoy... Or you're the ace...

363
00:21:33,868 --> 00:21:38,102
I'd say the coolest player is the one
causes the most panic for the opposing team.

364
00:21:38,696 --> 00:21:40,989
Like, "Watch that mid-blocker, he's crazy!"

365
00:21:41,488 --> 00:21:42,165
That kinda thing.

366
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:43,323
Uh-huh, uh-huh!

367
00:21:45,794 --> 00:21:47,159
Let's do our best.

368
00:21:50,172 --> 00:21:51,023
Will do!

369
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:57,455
Oh! I guess that all depends on whether or not
they let me back into the starting lineup, huh?

370
00:21:59,804 --> 00:22:03,034
Man, for such a big guy... You really are a softy.

371
00:22:03,472 --> 00:22:06,018
It's real good to see you back in action again, Suga.

372
00:22:06,621 --> 00:22:09,492
Yeah, sorry I got all obsessive
and weird about everything.

373
00:22:09,843 --> 00:22:11,169
I didn't say you did...

374
00:22:12,485 --> 00:22:13,881
It's good to have you back too.

375
00:22:13,906 --> 00:22:15,067
Aw yeah!

376
00:22:15,142 --> 00:22:18,294
But try not to assault the vice
principal anymore... Got that?

377
00:22:19,593 --> 00:22:25,231
And finally... I'm glad our soft-spoken wing
blocker is back from his little vacation... Right, Asahi?

378
00:22:27,544 --> 00:22:30,015
Let's get everything squared away and call it a night!

379
00:22:36,916 --> 00:22:38,106
Keep it up, guys!

380
00:22:38,585 --> 00:22:39,121
Alright?

381
00:22:39,394 --> 00:22:41,216
Yeah!

382
00:24:13,637 --> 00:24:15,159
Almost time for training camp.

383
00:24:15,184 --> 00:24:19,317
Ch-yeah, I can't wait to be under
the same roof with Kiyoko-Tanaka!

384
00:24:19,342 --> 00:24:19,926
Noya!

385
00:24:19,951 --> 00:24:20,883
Tanaka!

386
00:24:20,907 --> 00:24:22,136
Noya! Noya!

387
00:24:22,161 --> 00:24:22,558
Tanaka!

388
00:24:22,582 --> 00:24:23,907
Uh, what's happening?

389
00:24:23,931 --> 00:24:25,022
Just ignore them...

390
00:24:25,138 --> 00:24:27,472
Next Haikyu!! "The decision."
