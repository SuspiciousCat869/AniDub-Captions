1
00:00:02,936 --> 00:00:05,674
I am so sorry, Tanaka! I mean it.

2
00:00:06,604 --> 00:00:11,114
I told you, it's okay... I'm worried
about you. Do you feel any better yet?

3
00:00:11,277 --> 00:00:14,872
Yeah... I do now that I'm off the
bus and I've rested a little bit.

4
00:00:14,897 --> 00:00:16,389
Sweet, I'm glad to hear that!

5
00:00:16,687 --> 00:00:19,990
After all, whether we win or
lose today totally depends on you!

6
00:00:20,015 --> 00:00:20,335
Huh?!

7
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:24,202
And let me hit everything unmarked
like you got to do in the 3-on-3, okay?

8
00:00:24,588 --> 00:00:27,473
Tanaka! Don't pressure him!

9
00:00:27,498 --> 00:00:28,923
What? I can't hear you.

10
00:00:29,107 --> 00:00:31,519
I-I'll do the best I can, I swear!

11
00:00:31,544 --> 00:00:34,400
Hurghhh, I'm going to the bathroom!

12
00:00:34,425 --> 00:00:37,525
Comin' out both ends?! You're workin' overtime!

13
00:00:38,024 --> 00:00:42,755
He's getting sick again? That is so
pathetic! I'm gonna teach him a lesson...

14
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:47,073
Hey what are you talking about?! You know
beating the little guy up isn't gonna do any good!

15
00:00:47,097 --> 00:00:48,683
Well, it's worth a try!

16
00:00:48,708 --> 00:00:50,521
Hold him back, Tanaka! Help me!

17
00:00:50,546 --> 00:00:51,171
You got it!

18
00:00:51,196 --> 00:00:52,545
Let go of me!

19
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,901
Hey, we're playing Karasuno today, right?

20
00:02:30,173 --> 00:02:31,522
Doesn't that one guy go there?

21
00:02:31,856 --> 00:02:32,342
Who?

22
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:33,921
The king of the court...

23
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:36,050
Didn't you guys go to middle school together?

24
00:02:36,242 --> 00:02:37,738
Or something like that?

25
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:39,667
Right... Kageyama...

26
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:42,208
There's nothing special about that guy.

27
00:02:42,804 --> 00:02:48,483
He had the best technique out of anybody on the team, but
the jerk couldn't act like a team player to save his life.

28
00:02:49,565 --> 00:02:50,954
Too full of himself.

29
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:57,740
Yeah... well I'm wondering why he went to Karasuno High...
I mean they haven't had a great team in a long time.

30
00:02:57,971 --> 00:03:01,918
All I know about them now is that they've
got some super hot babe for a team manager.

31
00:03:01,943 --> 00:03:03,048
They have a girl?!

32
00:03:03,076 --> 00:03:05,653
Yeah, she's got this sexy vibe about her.

33
00:03:05,725 --> 00:03:06,220
No.

34
00:03:06,716 --> 00:03:09,707
And one of their team members
looks like a juvenile delinquent...

35
00:03:10,049 --> 00:03:11,983
The guy's even got a shaved bald head.

36
00:03:12,373 --> 00:03:14,575
And it seems like he's pretty stupid too.

37
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,927
Hmmm?

38
00:03:19,193 --> 00:03:21,178
Um... hello...

39
00:03:21,203 --> 00:03:22,879
Don't mock my team, bro.

40
00:03:26,602 --> 00:03:27,913
We'll have your heads.

41
00:03:29,839 --> 00:03:33,618
Heh. Come on, Tanaka, there's no need to talk like that.

42
00:03:34,257 --> 00:03:39,239
I mean look what you've done. The hotshots from Aoba
Johsai High School are practically shaking in their shoes.

43
00:03:39,264 --> 00:03:41,532
You idiots really think we're afraid of you?!

44
00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:45,601
Who is this beanpole? I didn't
know they had a player that tall.

45
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:47,445
Oh yeah, good thinkin'...

46
00:03:48,472 --> 00:03:51,361
It'll hurt worse if we kick
your asses on the court instead.

47
00:03:51,386 --> 00:03:55,132
Hey! Knock it off! I cannot take you anywhere!

48
00:03:55,211 --> 00:03:56,480
Please excuse him!

49
00:03:56,514 --> 00:03:58,037
Uh, it's fine.

50
00:03:58,062 --> 00:03:59,902
Don't make that face at me!

51
00:04:02,349 --> 00:04:04,686
So how ya been? Your majesty...

52
00:04:05,132 --> 00:04:08,924
I bet you've already whipped your new
loyal subjects into shape. Haven'tcha?

53
00:04:14,348 --> 00:04:15,088
Uh-huh.

54
00:04:18,343 --> 00:04:19,812
Ow! What was that for?!

55
00:04:19,837 --> 00:04:23,074
Yep, that's the king... as stuck up as ever.

56
00:04:34,227 --> 00:04:38,454
Whoa... no way... this gym is huge... They're huge...

57
00:04:38,829 --> 00:04:39,708
All together!

58
00:04:40,028 --> 00:04:41,708
Thank you for having us!

59
00:04:42,589 --> 00:04:43,796
Thank you!

60
00:04:45,055 --> 00:04:50,690
Every single player on the Seijoh team has exceptional
offensive and defensive abilities individually.

61
00:04:50,804 --> 00:04:54,642
Their guys are all good enough to
be the ace no matter where they go.

62
00:04:54,768 --> 00:04:56,318
That's good, keep working on it!

63
00:04:56,343 --> 00:04:58,765
And they're also famous for their power blocking guys.

64
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:04,267
I dunno what you two are so scared of. Hinata's
gonna take those losers by surprise and blow 'em away!

65
00:05:04,897 --> 00:05:08,814
Plus... I know how much you suck so I'll
be there to cover for you the whole time!

66
00:05:11,679 --> 00:05:14,418
Oh, but you're on your own
whenever you serve the ball, remember?

67
00:05:14,443 --> 00:05:16,109
Try not to screw up Okie Dokie!

68
00:05:17,693 --> 00:05:21,216
I'm just kiddin'! Fumblin' a
serve isn't all that bad my man!

69
00:05:21,586 --> 00:05:23,967
Just let it roll off your back and keep slammin'.

70
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:26,549
Hm? Hey hang on.. Where'd he go?

71
00:05:26,896 --> 00:05:28,130
The bathroom, I think.

72
00:05:28,222 --> 00:05:29,401
Not again!

73
00:05:30,054 --> 00:05:33,515
Ugh, I'm in trouble... ggh!

74
00:05:33,608 --> 00:05:37,054
Man, those Karasuno guys sure are
arrogant. Who do they think they are?

75
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:38,610
Ugh, yeah. Huh?

76
00:05:40,013 --> 00:05:43,892
Hey... he was next to Kageyama in that game last year.

77
00:05:44,391 --> 00:05:47,078
I could never forget a guy whose head looks like an onion.

78
00:05:47,461 --> 00:05:49,957
Hey... take it you're one of their first-years.

79
00:05:50,619 --> 00:05:51,746
What's it to you?

80
00:05:51,771 --> 00:05:54,309
So... how is king Kageyama?

81
00:05:54,334 --> 00:05:57,923
Has he learned any manners? Or is
he still the same conceited jackass?

82
00:05:57,948 --> 00:06:02,423
What are you, crazy?! "Conceited"
doesn't even come close to it!

83
00:06:02,738 --> 00:06:05,050
It's like I'm a small, sad little peasant.

84
00:06:05,075 --> 00:06:08,923
Putting up with the daily torture of
living in the land without fun or happiness!

85
00:06:09,292 --> 00:06:12,905
Just 'cause he's kinda good, he
thinks he's the boss of everybody!

86
00:06:13,248 --> 00:06:14,489
See what I mean?

87
00:06:15,191 --> 00:06:16,593
He hates that guy!

88
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:20,766
I mean, I'll be the first to admit he's
good at receiving, blocking, and serving...

89
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:22,298
Oh yeah.. Real good!

90
00:06:22,429 --> 00:06:23,332
And his sets are great too...

91
00:06:23,357 --> 00:06:24,435
A pain in the ass...

92
00:06:25,101 --> 00:06:25,708
Huh?

93
00:06:26,797 --> 00:06:27,748
Are you sure?

94
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:29,004
Uh-huh.

95
00:06:31,272 --> 00:06:35,809
Let me guess, you've never had to hit one of
Kageyama's crazy sets in a real game, have you?

96
00:06:36,193 --> 00:06:39,135
They're terrible! It's literally impossible to hit one!

97
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,452
That bad, huh?

98
00:06:40,701 --> 00:06:42,287
He's a selfish dictator.

99
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:46,107
What's the point of him being a setter if
he can't put the ball where anyone can hit it?

100
00:06:46,249 --> 00:06:47,871
He doesn't belong in that position.

101
00:06:48,376 --> 00:06:52,639
To him, a "teammate" is just a mindless
slave who does whatever he tells them.

102
00:06:53,427 --> 00:06:56,547
Anyone he can't use... goes straight into the trash...

103
00:06:57,093 --> 00:06:57,907
Buh-bye!

104
00:07:01,335 --> 00:07:03,955
You wanna know if he's changed since middle school?

105
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:06,050
You just wait and see, onion-top!

106
00:07:06,107 --> 00:07:06,933
What'd you say?!

107
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:08,267
Isn't that right, shorty?

108
00:07:08,497 --> 00:07:09,053
Uh?

109
00:07:10,524 --> 00:07:13,146
Anyone he can't use goes in the trash?

110
00:07:14,314 --> 00:07:16,529
What happens if I screw up in front of him?

111
00:07:17,421 --> 00:07:19,001
I have had enough of you!

112
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:21,638
I'll get swapped out!

113
00:07:22,966 --> 00:07:24,458
I'm gonna be sick!

114
00:07:25,557 --> 00:07:27,724
Yeah, this is gonna be a good game.

115
00:07:31,393 --> 00:07:32,014
Hinata!

116
00:07:32,191 --> 00:07:35,467
Don't let your jitters get
the best of you my man... relax.

117
00:07:35,512 --> 00:07:37,916
Yes sir, I'll relax as hard as I can!

118
00:07:38,316 --> 00:07:41,984
Hey Kiyoko, do you think you could
give him a few words of inspiration?

119
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:42,639
Hm?

120
00:07:44,676 --> 00:07:45,363
Excuse me.

121
00:07:45,388 --> 00:07:45,959
Huh?

122
00:07:48,951 --> 00:07:50,312
Do your best.

123
00:07:53,927 --> 00:07:57,090
Well, I killed Hinata... Sorry, guys.

124
00:07:59,869 --> 00:08:04,595
Let the practice game between Karasuno
High and Aoba Johsai officially begin!

125
00:08:05,517 --> 00:08:06,624
Thank you!

126
00:08:07,001 --> 00:08:10,532
Is that short guy supposed to be their
middle blocker? That has to be a mistake right?

127
00:08:10,557 --> 00:08:13,718
Is that really Kageyama over
there? Why's he with these guys?

128
00:08:15,117 --> 00:08:17,221
C'mon, pull yourself together, Hinata.

129
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:19,701
Yes sir! I'll get it together right now!

130
00:08:19,946 --> 00:08:21,780
Seriously... calm down!

131
00:08:22,094 --> 00:08:27,509
Hey, Hinata! You know the plan right?
Do it exactly like the 3-on-3, okay?

132
00:08:27,534 --> 00:08:28,687
Yeah, I understand!

133
00:08:28,712 --> 00:08:29,909
You sure about that?

134
00:08:31,563 --> 00:08:32,983
Do it, Matsukawa!

135
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:35,273
I got it! Right here!

136
00:08:35,954 --> 00:08:39,364
You moron! What's with you?!
That obviously wasn't your ball!

137
00:08:39,389 --> 00:08:40,087
I'm sorry!

138
00:08:40,112 --> 00:08:41,167
Ennoshita, cover!

139
00:08:41,192 --> 00:08:41,907
Tanaka!

140
00:08:41,932 --> 00:08:42,573
On it!

141
00:08:46,122 --> 00:08:46,705
Ah...

142
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:47,811
That's one point.

143
00:08:49,288 --> 00:08:53,135
It's okay Hinata, just take a nice deep
breath and pay attention to your surroundings.

144
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,270
I'm sorry!

145
00:08:55,174 --> 00:08:57,812
He's completely cracked under the pressure.

146
00:08:58,458 --> 00:09:00,078
Oof!

147
00:09:01,944 --> 00:09:03,311
Hinataaa!

148
00:09:03,653 --> 00:09:06,010
Please stop stressing out, buddy.

149
00:09:08,737 --> 00:09:10,589
Yeah! Thanks a lot pal!

150
00:09:10,614 --> 00:09:11,637
It touched the net.

151
00:09:11,908 --> 00:09:13,865
Karasuno's finally on the scoreboard.

152
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:15,204
Come oooon!

153
00:09:15,229 --> 00:09:17,577
Quit being nervous or I will kill you!

154
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:20,783
Well... there's the great leader I
remember. That's not helping me calm down!

155
00:09:20,808 --> 00:09:22,378
He hasn't changed a bit.

156
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:25,714
Alright! We're gonna take all those points back!

157
00:09:26,142 --> 00:09:27,240
Next one to serve...

158
00:09:28,145 --> 00:09:31,416
Oh no... Hinata's up to serve.

159
00:09:31,961 --> 00:09:33,746
Talk about bad timing!

160
00:09:34,691 --> 00:09:35,254
Just breathe, Hinata!

161
00:09:35,278 --> 00:09:39,411
If I flub this serve, we automatically
lose a point and the set's over!

162
00:09:40,783 --> 00:09:44,313
Dude, call me crazy, but I think
Hinata just stopped breathing. Is he okay?

163
00:09:44,444 --> 00:09:46,642
How do you expect me to know that, huh?

164
00:09:46,943 --> 00:09:50,589
Anyone he can't use... Goes
straight into the trash... buh-bye!

165
00:09:51,042 --> 00:09:53,737
You can't mess this up. If you do, you'll get benched!

166
00:09:53,762 --> 00:09:57,453
Just calm down... everything's
fine... everything's juuust...

167
00:09:59,498 --> 00:10:01,849
Gah... crap, that was a terrible hit!

168
00:10:01,874 --> 00:10:02,432
Gah!

169
00:10:02,717 --> 00:10:03,460
Guah!

170
00:10:03,512 --> 00:10:04,317
Ach!

171
00:10:44,596 --> 00:10:46,963
Pffff... Damn, Kageyama...

172
00:10:46,988 --> 00:10:48,327
That was perfect!

173
00:10:48,352 --> 00:10:49,884
I sure hope you've got a couple
brain cells left over after all that!

174
00:10:49,909 --> 00:10:52,003
Stop, you're only making it worse!

175
00:10:52,851 --> 00:10:54,444
Knock it off, you two!

176
00:10:56,326 --> 00:10:57,488
I'm so dead...

177
00:10:58,792 --> 00:11:00,499
Ah... hold on, Kageyama...

178
00:11:01,674 --> 00:11:02,953
D-don't hurt me!

179
00:11:03,485 --> 00:11:04,986
L-let's talk about this!

180
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:06,366
W-wait a second!

181
00:11:06,889 --> 00:11:07,854
N-no!

182
00:11:23,146 --> 00:11:23,810
Look.

183
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,654
What could you possibly be freaking out about?

184
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:31,458
How tall those guys are? Your first practice game?

185
00:11:34,178 --> 00:11:38,433
There can't be anything scarier than
hitting me in the head with the ball...

186
00:11:42,064 --> 00:11:42,830
right?

187
00:11:44,886 --> 00:11:46,823
No, that's my worst nightmare.

188
00:11:47,268 --> 00:11:50,707
Well, in that case you've got
nothing left to be scared of anymore...

189
00:11:50,776 --> 00:11:54,410
I mean, you've already done the
most terrifying thing you can do.

190
00:11:55,151 --> 00:11:59,693
Which means... Might as well get over it
and get your head in the game, dumb-ass!

191
00:12:01,831 --> 00:12:03,377
So I'm not in trouble then?!

192
00:12:03,402 --> 00:12:04,944
No.. Who cares?

193
00:12:04,969 --> 00:12:09,233
Gah! Well if I can get away with that,
I guess I can get away with anything!

194
00:12:09,567 --> 00:12:11,599
Thanks for freaking me out, onionhead!

195
00:12:12,429 --> 00:12:12,964
Hm?

196
00:12:13,136 --> 00:12:16,469
Still, we did just lose the first set thanks to me.

197
00:12:16,494 --> 00:12:19,250
Kageyama's not the only teammate
I should be worried about.

198
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,713
Sidebar, Hinata.

199
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,198
Listen up.

200
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,222
Yes?

201
00:12:25,489 --> 00:12:31,001
Don't go thinkin' you have to be as good as these more
experienced guys already... That doesn't make any sense.

202
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,944
But I have to do things right... or else...

203
00:12:33,969 --> 00:12:35,297
I'll get taken out.

204
00:12:36,182 --> 00:12:38,086
And I want to play the whole game.

205
00:12:38,544 --> 00:12:42,824
Look, kid... you're stupid if you
think that crap is gonna change my mind!

206
00:12:42,849 --> 00:12:45,008
I know good and well what a klutz you are!

207
00:12:45,366 --> 00:12:47,756
Daichi knows too and he still let you play!

208
00:12:47,812 --> 00:12:48,202
Huh?

209
00:12:48,227 --> 00:12:50,203
Forget about being swapped out!

210
00:12:50,362 --> 00:12:53,825
You can worry about that when... uh...

211
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:57,279
When you do get swapped out, how about that?!

212
00:12:57,303 --> 00:12:58,235
Huh?!

213
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:00,267
Do you think we should step in?

214
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:02,288
No, I think Tanaka can handle it.

215
00:13:02,732 --> 00:13:05,210
See, here's the cool thing about volleyball.

216
00:13:05,235 --> 00:13:09,441
Everybody you see on this side
of the net... is your ally, okay?!

217
00:13:09,466 --> 00:13:11,792
So it's fine if you kinda suck.

218
00:13:11,817 --> 00:13:16,403
Just do your thing, even if it messes
us up! We're here to back you up, bro!

219
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,488
We're a team! Us and you!

220
00:13:21,429 --> 00:13:23,412
Now, who's your favorite upperclassman?!

221
00:13:23,619 --> 00:13:24,772
It's you for sure!

222
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:26,113
Haha, call me Mr.Tanaka sir!

223
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:28,864
Tanaka really wants to be treated like an upperclassman.

224
00:13:28,896 --> 00:13:31,772
Yeah... well it's still good to have him on the team.

225
00:13:32,765 --> 00:13:38,273
Crap like that always sound best coming from
someone who's honest to a fault... Like he is.

226
00:13:40,238 --> 00:13:40,940
What's up?

227
00:13:41,325 --> 00:13:43,142
Eh, just a practice game.

228
00:13:43,167 --> 00:13:44,928
Looks like they're starting the 2nd set.

229
00:13:45,134 --> 00:13:48,479
Dude, you gotta teach me how to do
that back-of-the-head serve later!

230
00:13:49,508 --> 00:13:52,149
Yeah, it's great. Could you teach it to me too?

231
00:13:53,516 --> 00:13:54,853
You're up, Ennoshita!

232
00:13:56,586 --> 00:13:58,340
It's just like the 3-on-3.

233
00:13:59,011 --> 00:14:01,471
First, go to a spot where they don't have any blockers.

234
00:14:01,496 --> 00:14:04,876
Then at your maximum speed, I want you
to jump and swing as hard as you can...

235
00:14:05,068 --> 00:14:08,265
Be careful not to bump into
our other spikers though, okay?

236
00:14:08,302 --> 00:14:09,321
Yeah I gotcha!

237
00:14:09,587 --> 00:14:10,330
Kunimi!

238
00:14:12,328 --> 00:14:13,329
You got cover?

239
00:14:13,715 --> 00:14:14,246
Yeah!

240
00:14:14,472 --> 00:14:15,780
Let's take it to the left!

241
00:14:15,805 --> 00:14:16,471
No, right!

242
00:14:16,496 --> 00:14:20,394
They can't do quick attacks. I'm sure
they'll shoot for an opening on the side.

243
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:22,990
Huh?

244
00:14:26,309 --> 00:14:27,344
What in the hell?

245
00:14:29,365 --> 00:14:31,457
Huh? I didn't touch it...

246
00:14:34,778 --> 00:14:36,503
So they can do quick attacks?

247
00:14:37,048 --> 00:14:38,074
Maybe it's a bluff.

248
00:14:38,812 --> 00:14:39,657
Either way...

249
00:14:40,544 --> 00:14:44,534
If you keep missing those, it's only a matter
of time before the king tears you a new one!

250
00:14:45,805 --> 00:14:46,523
Hinata!

251
00:14:47,311 --> 00:14:48,248
Here it comes.

252
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:52,099
Sorry 'bout that... That last
set... It was a bit too high.

253
00:14:54,072 --> 00:14:55,064
He's sorry?

254
00:14:55,824 --> 00:14:56,825
I guess so.

255
00:14:57,456 --> 00:14:59,131
That's cool, I forgive you.

256
00:14:59,705 --> 00:15:04,348
Owowowow! Stop giving me the iron claw, Kageyama!

257
00:15:05,647 --> 00:15:06,696
Service!

258
00:15:07,413 --> 00:15:07,666
Nice serve!

259
00:15:07,691 --> 00:15:08,975
Hey, comin' atcha!

260
00:15:09,243 --> 00:15:09,747
Got it!

261
00:15:11,547 --> 00:15:12,940
They go the right and center.

262
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:14,488
Left side's waiting.

263
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:16,268
Who's the king gonna pick?

264
00:15:16,935 --> 00:15:18,200
Okay, here goes!

265
00:15:22,947 --> 00:15:23,454
Huh?

266
00:15:23,677 --> 00:15:25,072
Woooo!!

267
00:15:25,097 --> 00:15:26,096
Yes!

268
00:15:26,235 --> 00:15:27,273
Nice one!

269
00:15:27,363 --> 00:15:30,949
I see... It's that weird set-and-spike routine again.

270
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:32,372
Did you see that?!

271
00:15:32,397 --> 00:15:33,468
He's fast!

272
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,106
Come over here, you two!

273
00:15:35,618 --> 00:15:36,100
Uh?

274
00:15:36,504 --> 00:15:37,674
Nice play!

275
00:15:38,081 --> 00:15:39,666
Yeah!

276
00:15:39,937 --> 00:15:43,168
Awesooome! That was so team-like!

277
00:15:43,193 --> 00:15:47,313
Huh? What do you mean "like"? We are a team.

278
00:15:49,284 --> 00:15:51,534
Yeah, you're totally right!

279
00:15:51,789 --> 00:15:53,232
Nice one, first-year.

280
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:54,038
Thank you!

281
00:15:54,271 --> 00:15:55,961
Quick-attacks? Really?

282
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:59,193
He seems a lot different since the first set ended.

283
00:15:59,257 --> 00:16:04,136
That's right, start panicking. I want
you to be totally focused on Hinata.

284
00:16:04,369 --> 00:16:08,951
Okay guys, Hinata's on track
now. Time for the counterattack.

285
00:16:09,152 --> 00:16:09,890
Heh!

286
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:12,690
A chance ball!

287
00:16:12,715 --> 00:16:13,521
I got it!

288
00:16:13,695 --> 00:16:17,142
I know what to look out for
now. You're not foolin' me kid!

289
00:16:17,338 --> 00:16:19,020
What did you say?!

290
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:23,009
You're mine now!

291
00:16:23,159 --> 00:16:25,123
Eat this! You like that?!

292
00:16:25,148 --> 00:16:27,002
Dammit, the shorty was a decoy.

293
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:29,339
Aw man I thought he was sending it to me!

294
00:16:29,882 --> 00:16:31,252
How do you like me now?!

295
00:16:31,276 --> 00:16:31,787
Huh?

296
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:33,687
Told you we'd show your asses up!

297
00:16:35,143 --> 00:16:39,695
Uwah... I acted all tough and talked
smack 'cause I thought the ball was for me.

298
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,703
I feel dumb!

299
00:16:40,728 --> 00:16:42,268
And there's nothing wrong with that...

300
00:16:42,711 --> 00:16:44,284
You were convinced you were going to hit it..

301
00:16:44,609 --> 00:16:46,413
So you convinced all of them too.

302
00:16:47,233 --> 00:16:48,275
Does that work?

303
00:16:48,676 --> 00:16:49,569
Apparently.

304
00:16:50,632 --> 00:16:51,112
Dammit.

305
00:16:51,137 --> 00:16:52,549
Relax, Kindaichi...

306
00:16:53,443 --> 00:16:57,148
We're making all our attacks count
today. There's no need to let it get to you.

307
00:16:57,284 --> 00:16:57,863
Right.

308
00:17:00,871 --> 00:17:01,717
Whoa...

309
00:17:01,769 --> 00:17:06,164
Even to the untrained eye, it's pretty obvious that
their blocks are being scattered all over the place.

310
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:09,056
Was Karasuno High ever this good before now?

311
00:17:09,807 --> 00:17:10,290
Bleh!

312
00:17:11,389 --> 00:17:12,025
Not again!

313
00:17:12,049 --> 00:17:13,854
They make a lot of mistakes, though.

314
00:17:24,056 --> 00:17:24,941
Over here!

315
00:17:25,288 --> 00:17:26,125
Yes sir!

316
00:17:27,837 --> 00:17:29,079
Something wrong, Hinata?

317
00:17:30,087 --> 00:17:30,704
No...

318
00:17:30,728 --> 00:17:35,838
It's just that the first time I played in a game, I felt
like it was up to me to carry the whole thing by myself.

319
00:17:36,174 --> 00:17:41,115
But now, I'm surrounded by a team full of
players who are a lot better at the game than me.

320
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:42,608
I can depend on them.

321
00:17:42,765 --> 00:17:44,879
All I gotta do is believe and jump!

322
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:47,620
I guess I never really had to worry about much else, huh?

323
00:17:48,934 --> 00:17:49,449
Huh...

324
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:50,693
Hurry up.

325
00:17:51,005 --> 00:17:55,150
He may not realize it yet. But that leap
of faith of his is one hell of a weapon.

326
00:17:55,615 --> 00:17:56,879
Okay what's the deal?

327
00:17:57,099 --> 00:17:59,619
That Kageyama guy isn't anything like you said he was.

328
00:17:59,659 --> 00:18:01,638
Yeah, well I've never seen him like that either!

329
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:05,190
How was I supposed to know that there would
actually be a spiker on this planet who could hit

330
00:18:05,215 --> 00:18:06,767
those ridiculous royal sets?!

331
00:18:06,792 --> 00:18:08,107
That's not quite it.

332
00:18:09,221 --> 00:18:13,096
From where I'm standing, their number 5
player hasn't been looking at the ball at all.

333
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:15,775
Wait what are you talking about, coach?

334
00:18:15,862 --> 00:18:19,138
The best I can figure out is that
Kageyama is purposely aiming the ball

335
00:18:19,162 --> 00:18:21,849
to match the downward swing of
the palm of the spiker's hand.

336
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,267
Is that even possible?

337
00:18:24,554 --> 00:18:28,056
So Kageyama... changed his playing style?

338
00:18:28,467 --> 00:18:29,555
I'll tell you one thing.

339
00:18:29,735 --> 00:18:35,519
That number 5 of theirs must be pretty darn talented if he
can get a self-centered and arrogant player like Kageyama.

340
00:18:35,544 --> 00:18:37,416
To adjust his habits like that.

341
00:18:37,912 --> 00:18:43,397
The really incredible part of it is that number 5
apparently trusts in Kageyama's sets one hundred percent.

342
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:46,847
He simply believes the ball will come.

343
00:18:47,878 --> 00:18:51,286
If they shake off your blocking, just
receive and keep the ball in the air!

344
00:18:51,552 --> 00:18:54,837
You boys are our starting lineup.
Show 'em what you're made of!

345
00:18:55,038 --> 00:18:55,826
Right!

346
00:18:58,548 --> 00:19:00,314
Let's turn this game around!

347
00:19:00,493 --> 00:19:02,055
Kageyama's really good...

348
00:19:02,492 --> 00:19:05,422
I kind of wish we could've
recruited him back at Aoba-Johsai...

349
00:19:05,712 --> 00:19:07,251
Didn't you try to get him here, sir?

350
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:08,440
Yeah...

351
00:19:08,746 --> 00:19:13,494
But even if he had come to our school, despite all of
his technical ability, would he have made plays like that?

352
00:19:13,613 --> 00:19:14,558
I don't think so.

353
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:15,266
Huh?

354
00:19:16,027 --> 00:19:21,480
I think it's Karasuno - specifically that number
5 that made him into the player we are looking at now.

355
00:19:22,412 --> 00:19:22,653
Hm?

356
00:19:22,678 --> 00:19:23,849
Hey, time to start.

357
00:19:26,509 --> 00:19:27,385
Chance ball!

358
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:29,634
Four-eyes!

359
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:32,439
Aw yeah!

360
00:19:32,676 --> 00:19:33,766
Good one, Tsukki!

361
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:35,546
Nice, Tsukishima!

362
00:19:35,939 --> 00:19:39,015
Your sets are so precise, it actually makes me nauseous.

363
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:39,893
What!

364
00:19:39,918 --> 00:19:44,642
Tsukishima is being kinda rude about it,
But I understand where he's coming from...

365
00:19:44,964 --> 00:19:49,178
Anytime he wants the ball to come his
way, it's already right there in front of him.

366
00:19:49,456 --> 00:19:52,370
It's a little scary... But... It works.

367
00:19:52,854 --> 00:19:56,299
We're in the middle of a game guys.
Can we maybe save this for later?

368
00:19:56,324 --> 00:19:57,513
Your serve, Tanaka!

369
00:19:57,538 --> 00:19:58,381
You got this!

370
00:19:58,406 --> 00:20:00,135
Ah, I get it now.

371
00:20:00,464 --> 00:20:04,669
The team rotates every time they
earn a point and get serving rights...

372
00:20:04,694 --> 00:20:10,730
Which means Kageyama, Tsukishima, and
Ennoshita should all be playing forward now.

373
00:20:10,755 --> 00:20:15,078
Right. So at this point, their positions are the
opposite of what they were when the game started.

374
00:20:15,103 --> 00:20:19,914
Thanks to Hinata's decoy tactics, the
overall success rate of our attacks increases

375
00:20:19,939 --> 00:20:24,416
whenever we have him in the front row...
Also, whenever the ball goes to Tsukishima...

376
00:20:27,651 --> 00:20:30,672
His blocks are every bit as intimidating as Seijoh's are!

377
00:20:31,749 --> 00:20:34,176
I'm sorry, is blocking your specialty too?

378
00:20:34,716 --> 00:20:36,973
Just try and stay out of my way, would ya?

379
00:20:36,998 --> 00:20:38,132
Watch your mouth...

380
00:20:38,347 --> 00:20:41,239
Get too close and your skinny ass'll get blown away.

381
00:20:41,873 --> 00:20:44,207
Uh.. Let's not fight, okay guys?

382
00:20:44,232 --> 00:20:46,969
You're s'posed to fight the guys in blue! Blue!

383
00:20:47,305 --> 00:20:48,670
Here comes the ball!

384
00:20:53,977 --> 00:20:56,812
What are you so proud of? I was
the one who blocked it, you know.

385
00:20:56,837 --> 00:20:58,753
Oh whatever, it hit my hand too!

386
00:20:58,778 --> 00:21:01,404
Knock it off! Cut that crap out!

387
00:21:01,537 --> 00:21:03,211
Heh, for once it's not me getting yelled at...

388
00:21:03,236 --> 00:21:06,047
Wipe that grin off your stupid
face or I will wipe it off for you!

389
00:21:06,072 --> 00:21:07,848
What did I just tell you?!

390
00:21:10,148 --> 00:21:10,977
Crap...

391
00:21:11,674 --> 00:21:12,972
This is too close.

392
00:21:13,607 --> 00:21:16,763
Get it together, Kunimi, that won't happen if you cover!

393
00:21:16,997 --> 00:21:20,417
I was right, that number 5 of theirs is unstoppable, huh?

394
00:21:20,777 --> 00:21:24,547
I agree... combining him with
Kageyama is even more intimidating...

395
00:21:25,084 --> 00:21:26,463
But it's not just them.

396
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:31,275
What Tanaka lacks in composure
he makes up for in power and guts.

397
00:21:31,937 --> 00:21:35,652
Tsukishima's a smart blocker,
even if he's not too ambitious.

398
00:21:36,895 --> 00:21:40,499
Their captain Sawamura neatly
covers the team's weak areas.

399
00:21:41,441 --> 00:21:41,851
Over here!

400
00:21:41,876 --> 00:21:45,846
Some of the team members are amateurs,
and their defense is full of holes...

401
00:21:46,545 --> 00:21:50,200
But the offense is flexible enough
to make use of their greener players.

402
00:21:51,237 --> 00:21:53,404
They really took us by surprise.

403
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:59,360
So this is Karasuno. A wild... disjointed...

404
00:21:59,737 --> 00:22:02,101
Yeah!

405
00:22:02,176 --> 00:22:03,328
Interesting team.

406
00:22:05,009 --> 00:22:06,076
Whoa!

407
00:22:06,101 --> 00:22:07,769
I can't believe they won the set!

408
00:22:08,546 --> 00:22:09,249
Damn.

409
00:22:09,788 --> 00:22:11,693
You lookin' good out there, Kageyama.

410
00:22:11,718 --> 00:22:12,331
Thanks.

411
00:22:12,356 --> 00:22:14,516
Time to take the final set... Right?

412
00:22:15,673 --> 00:22:19,623
None of the guys on their team can
serve like Kageyama... It's an advantage.

413
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:25,087
Totally... it's been huge for us... Because
our receiving could use some work... Thank you.

414
00:22:25,419 --> 00:22:26,505
Don't get comfortable.

415
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:26,970
Huh?

416
00:22:29,428 --> 00:22:32,818
That setter of theirs... I don't
think he's... their starter...

417
00:22:33,312 --> 00:22:33,885
Huh?

418
00:22:35,752 --> 00:22:38,554
Hey... Oikawa's back. 'Bout time.

419
00:24:13,881 --> 00:24:16,006
So that's not Seijoh's official setter?!

420
00:24:16,031 --> 00:24:19,976
Who cares? I wanna know why this
joker walked in lookin' so smug.

421
00:24:20,001 --> 00:24:21,457
Kageyama, what do you know?!

422
00:24:21,481 --> 00:24:23,418
Well, you'll just have to find out next time.

423
00:24:23,622 --> 00:24:24,338
What?

424
00:24:24,857 --> 00:24:27,698
Next Haikyu!! "Versus the great king."
