1
00:03:03,501 --> 00:03:05,895
Shiiiiiiratorizawa!

2
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,502
Go, go-go-go-go SeiJOH!

3
00:03:13,765 --> 00:03:18,805
This is going to be the day that I humiliate
you once and for all... Are you ready big guy?

4
00:03:19,325 --> 00:03:22,207
I would rather you drop the nicknames, Oikawa.

5
00:03:31,257 --> 00:03:32,295
I'm starving!

6
00:03:32,615 --> 00:03:33,675
Lunch time!

7
00:03:34,154 --> 00:03:36,624
Hey Hinata, I'm really hungry! It's time to eat.

8
00:03:36,863 --> 00:03:37,541
Mhmm.

9
00:03:39,847 --> 00:03:42,104
I heard you guys played a close game yesterday.

10
00:03:43,551 --> 00:03:46,486
Yeah, man, our team lost in
the third round last week also...

11
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:49,413
The guys who beat us made it all the way to Nationals.

12
00:03:50,825 --> 00:03:52,772
What's wrong? You okay?

13
00:03:53,387 --> 00:03:54,188
Bathroom.

14
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,107
When Hinata and Kageyama first
came to the volleyball club...

15
00:04:03,417 --> 00:04:06,228
Daichi told us that we would
be going to the Spring Nationals.

16
00:04:07,627 --> 00:04:09,100
Spring Nationals...

17
00:04:09,702 --> 00:04:11,686
First qualifier's in August, right?

18
00:04:11,785 --> 00:04:14,461
Yeah, that's right... He said we'd go back there.

19
00:04:15,401 --> 00:04:17,658
There's no time to lick our wounds, boys.

20
00:04:20,138 --> 00:04:23,909
Hey... I think this might be a good time for me to retire.

21
00:04:26,426 --> 00:04:29,577
Ever since third-years were allowed
to play in the Spring Nationals...

22
00:04:29,902 --> 00:04:34,933
I've wanted us to survive to the finals
and go to Tokyo so we could do that.

23
00:04:36,129 --> 00:04:36,532
But...

24
00:04:38,023 --> 00:04:41,250
now that I've seen those incredible
first and second-years in action,

25
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:45,099
I feel like it might be better
to give up the club to them early.

26
00:04:46,671 --> 00:04:48,997
It's better to restructure the team around them,

27
00:04:49,195 --> 00:04:51,037
since they have so much potential.

28
00:04:51,687 --> 00:04:52,967
I just think I ought to step aside and...

29
00:04:52,992 --> 00:04:55,804
Daichi. Is that really what you want to do?

30
00:04:57,856 --> 00:05:00,918
I know being the captain means you
have to make the tough decisions...

31
00:05:00,943 --> 00:05:03,811
but it doesn't do any good to remove yourself completely.

32
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:07,099
It's one thing if that was your plan from the start.

33
00:05:07,655 --> 00:05:08,665
But come on...

34
00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:11,238
you shouldn't just leave because of the new guys!

35
00:05:14,321 --> 00:05:16,260
I will stay like I said I would!

36
00:05:16,687 --> 00:05:20,102
And I'm not going anywhere unless
the younger members ask me to leave!

37
00:05:20,561 --> 00:05:22,065
Whether you two stay or not!

38
00:05:22,902 --> 00:05:24,937
I told you yesterday I'm still in!

39
00:05:25,232 --> 00:05:27,082
I'm not going to college anyway...

40
00:05:27,235 --> 00:05:32,438
I guess if the underclassmen didn't
want me to stay I'd go, but... I... I...

41
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:33,238
Look!

42
00:05:34,975 --> 00:05:38,472
I still... I still want to stay!

43
00:05:38,673 --> 00:05:41,673
I love this game... you know that, don't you?!

44
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:54,920
Mr. Takeda?

45
00:05:55,796 --> 00:05:58,510
May I have a word with you about volleyball club?

46
00:05:58,932 --> 00:05:59,910
Okay.

47
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:00,885
So, you actually got to play.

48
00:07:02,188 --> 00:07:02,918
How was it?

49
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:05,817
Did you enjoy it, Tadashi?

50
00:07:09,209 --> 00:07:09,771
No...

51
00:07:11,705 --> 00:07:12,560
No!

52
00:07:15,549 --> 00:07:16,698
I thought as much.

53
00:07:17,077 --> 00:07:20,346
In the moment, you tense up
and can't move the way you want.

54
00:07:20,468 --> 00:07:22,055
Then the ball doesn't fly right...

55
00:07:22,522 --> 00:07:23,594
That's no fun at all.

56
00:07:26,248 --> 00:07:28,565
When I was younger, I used to like playing volleyball

57
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:31,410
because it was just a fun thing I
could do with my friends, you know?

58
00:07:32,345 --> 00:07:34,124
That's all this game was to me...

59
00:07:35,254 --> 00:07:38,607
But I was wrong; It's not like that at all.

60
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,435
I can't do what those other guys do.

61
00:07:45,771 --> 00:07:49,170
I want to control my body! I want to control the ball!

62
00:07:49,486 --> 00:07:52,501
I want what it takes to stand up to my opponents!

63
00:07:55,656 --> 00:07:59,497
"If you really want to get the most out of
playing sports, then you have to be strong."

64
00:08:02,387 --> 00:08:03,213
Coach Ukai...

65
00:08:03,982 --> 00:08:04,904
The older version...

66
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:07,550
That's the advice he would always give me.

67
00:08:08,068 --> 00:08:09,690
I wasn't his star ace...

68
00:08:09,715 --> 00:08:11,791
in fact, wasn't even in the starting lineup.

69
00:08:12,018 --> 00:08:13,306
I practiced hard though,

70
00:08:13,374 --> 00:08:15,665
and sometimes I felt like throwing in the towel.

71
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:17,638
But...

72
00:08:22,576 --> 00:08:25,913
The first time I nailed a
service ace during a real game...

73
00:08:26,886 --> 00:08:32,520
I realized... wow, this is the play I
spent all those long hours practicing for.

74
00:08:33,195 --> 00:08:36,561
That day, I decided to buckle down and work even harder,

75
00:08:36,761 --> 00:08:41,638
just to see if I could experience that
game, that point, that moment, all over again.

76
00:08:45,459 --> 00:08:46,985
Well then... Let's work!

77
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:51,578
The next game will be here before you know it.

78
00:08:56,082 --> 00:08:57,959
Tsukki! Are you ready for lunch?

79
00:08:57,984 --> 00:09:00,019
Please not so loud, Tadashi.

80
00:09:01,629 --> 00:09:04,399
Sorry, Tsukki! Tsukki!

81
00:09:06,316 --> 00:09:09,773
I received statements from both Sugawara and Sawamura

82
00:09:09,798 --> 00:09:14,766
that they'd be staying in volleyball club past
the Inter-High despite their plans to attend college.

83
00:09:15,286 --> 00:09:16,808
But then, Sugawara...

84
00:09:18,586 --> 00:09:19,304
Excuse me.

85
00:09:22,349 --> 00:09:23,161
Young man.

86
00:09:24,385 --> 00:09:28,033
I understand your feelings, but you
really should prioritize your studies.

87
00:09:28,595 --> 00:09:31,990
If you ask me, you don't stand to
gain anything by staying in the club.

88
00:09:33,318 --> 00:09:35,211
Maybe not... but...

89
00:09:36,069 --> 00:09:38,423
I don't play volleyball just to get ahead, y'know?

90
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,365
If I'm not mistaken, Sugawara's not
part of your starting lineup, right?

91
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:44,768
Umm... no.

92
00:09:45,172 --> 00:09:47,725
And I doubt he can get a sports scholarship.

93
00:09:47,798 --> 00:09:53,817
As it stands right now, he and Sawamura both tend to
get excellent grades.. But can they maintain those grades?

94
00:09:54,216 --> 00:09:57,055
Therefore, I'd like you to speak to those two.

95
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:00,854
And focus on their futures rather than
their current feelings on the matter.

96
00:10:01,973 --> 00:10:05,250
I don't want an adult talking
them out of what's best for them.

97
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:10,425
Poor kids...

98
00:10:11,178 --> 00:10:12,330
Yeah what about em?

99
00:10:12,633 --> 00:10:15,783
You know... I bet they're really bummed.

100
00:10:16,177 --> 00:10:18,833
That's why I gave 'em the whole day off from practice.

101
00:10:19,191 --> 00:10:21,075
Can't believe it was just yesterday.

102
00:10:27,921 --> 00:10:30,667
Aoba-Johsai... They're pretty good, huh?

103
00:10:31,127 --> 00:10:34,295
Damn right they are... They played a great game.

104
00:10:35,068 --> 00:10:37,614
I mean, we were on fire, don't get me wrong...

105
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:42,727
But to tell you the truth, I'm not so sure we can pull
that off the next time we have to play against those guys.

106
00:10:43,022 --> 00:10:48,007
And even if we do, it's not like Seijoh's
gonna be any less killer than they were yesterday.

107
00:10:48,662 --> 00:10:50,790
Did you notice how they did their time-outs?

108
00:10:50,829 --> 00:10:54,898
Uh-huh. It was mostly just a meeting between the players.

109
00:10:55,348 --> 00:10:57,942
I mean, the coaches watched from a distance.

110
00:10:58,518 --> 00:11:00,459
Well, I'm sure they helped a little.

111
00:11:03,406 --> 00:11:08,381
Seijoh's guys are always thinking and adapting
to every situation they're faced within a game.

112
00:11:08,842 --> 00:11:13,140
No matter what kind of weapon we throw at 'em...
they've always got something to counter it with.

113
00:11:13,308 --> 00:11:16,098
Yeah, they refused to be tripped up by anything we did.

114
00:11:16,562 --> 00:11:18,708
It was pretty stressful for me to watch.

115
00:11:19,117 --> 00:11:19,875
You know...

116
00:11:20,667 --> 00:11:26,229
I think there's only one team who has what it takes to
pry the points away from a well-oiled machine like Seijoh.

117
00:11:34,199 --> 00:11:35,960
And that's Shiratorizawa.

118
00:11:39,205 --> 00:11:42,530
After all the practicing and planning and strategizing...

119
00:11:43,189 --> 00:11:46,406
all it's taking is sheer force to tear us apart.

120
00:11:47,247 --> 00:11:50,742
Oh well. It doesn't matter how the victory's won, right?

121
00:11:51,603 --> 00:11:54,944
'Cause the loser... is the one who lets the ball drop.

122
00:11:56,537 --> 00:11:57,759
That's what counts.

123
00:13:11,953 --> 00:13:12,873
Here's the thing...

124
00:13:13,728 --> 00:13:17,914
If you sustained an injury and it wasn't
given the proper amount of time to heal...

125
00:13:18,323 --> 00:13:21,715
Because you wanted to keep playing
since your time here was limited,

126
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:23,335
I'd have to stop you.

127
00:13:23,897 --> 00:13:26,979
Some things can't be done no matter how you feel.

128
00:13:27,593 --> 00:13:30,330
You four still have some time before graduation...

129
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:33,179
The good news is... you have some options.

130
00:13:33,916 --> 00:13:37,812
Now... neglecting and failing your
entrance exams is not one of them!

131
00:13:38,464 --> 00:13:44,072
To overcome your obstacles... it takes
patience and hard work... sometimes sacrifice.

132
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:47,130
Every hour you spend on your extracurriculars

133
00:13:47,155 --> 00:13:52,027
is time that other students will spend
studying and preparing for the workforce.

134
00:13:52,316 --> 00:13:54,330
That's going to cause a disparity.

135
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:58,612
It might not seem like it now,
but one day you may regret it.

136
00:14:00,931 --> 00:14:02,937
So please give this some thought.

137
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:07,570
Try to choose the option you won't
regret 5 or 10 years down the road.

138
00:14:27,212 --> 00:14:28,206
Get lower.

139
00:14:29,197 --> 00:14:30,150
Sure thing.

140
00:14:34,644 --> 00:14:37,503
Guess the finals are... almost over with.

141
00:14:39,877 --> 00:14:40,575
Yeah...

142
00:14:41,677 --> 00:14:44,677
And so whoever wins gets to go to the Nationals.

143
00:14:45,191 --> 00:14:47,297
They get to keep playing more games.

144
00:14:49,688 --> 00:14:50,406
Yeah...

145
00:14:54,188 --> 00:14:57,929
It's not FAAAAAIIIR!

146
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:17,071
Damn...

147
00:15:20,675 --> 00:15:22,164
DAMN IT!

148
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:12,455
I wanna win.

149
00:16:14,389 --> 00:16:18,077
I'm never... going to say I'm sorry again.

150
00:16:20,444 --> 00:16:22,544
And I won't make a set I regret...

151
00:16:24,018 --> 00:16:25,090
not ever!

152
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:34,675
Only the strong...

153
00:16:36,723 --> 00:16:38,108
Stay on the court.

154
00:16:42,841 --> 00:16:43,453
Yeah...

155
00:16:44,373 --> 00:16:45,086
Right.

156
00:16:47,995 --> 00:16:50,305
Let's do better... now!

157
00:16:54,557 --> 00:16:56,316
I think you should eat lunch first.

158
00:16:58,598 --> 00:17:00,853
Ki..Kiyoko!

159
00:17:01,533 --> 00:17:05,944
Also, I heard you screaming all the way
in the club room... So please quiet down.

160
00:17:05,969 --> 00:17:07,219
Oh! Right!

161
00:17:07,244 --> 00:17:09,139
Kiyokoooo!

162
00:17:10,695 --> 00:17:12,803
You're looking pretty as ever today, baby!

163
00:17:12,828 --> 00:17:14,935
I think you're prettier than he does!

164
00:17:15,258 --> 00:17:19,631
I am all yours forever, my deeeeear!

165
00:17:22,404 --> 00:17:23,970
Try not to hurt yourselves.

166
00:17:24,177 --> 00:17:26,609
We're off today. So why are you guys here?

167
00:17:27,584 --> 00:17:30,062
I could ask you two the same question y'know.

168
00:17:30,509 --> 00:17:31,109
Hi!

169
00:17:34,922 --> 00:17:35,365
Hey.

170
00:17:36,017 --> 00:17:38,578
Welp. We're all here... Almost.

171
00:17:39,247 --> 00:17:42,249
Well maybe the third-years decided not to come back.

172
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:43,577
Hey, hey, hey!

173
00:17:44,036 --> 00:17:46,669
You know they wouldn't leave us hangin' like that! Ever!

174
00:17:46,694 --> 00:17:49,926
Huh? Wait, what does that mean?! Are they...?!

175
00:17:50,179 --> 00:17:53,070
Hey, the third-years didn't quit the team, did they?!

176
00:17:53,338 --> 00:17:56,063
They're still going to Spring Nationals with us, right?!

177
00:18:02,601 --> 00:18:04,310
Hurry... we're late!

178
00:18:05,578 --> 00:18:08,563
Yes. They're staying.

179
00:18:10,612 --> 00:18:12,342
What kept ya nerds?!

180
00:18:14,804 --> 00:18:16,579
Let's do this... okay?

181
00:18:19,669 --> 00:18:21,635
Yeah!

182
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:29,648
Well, here I am. Wonder if those crazy kids showed up.

183
00:18:36,351 --> 00:18:37,356
Nice kill!

184
00:18:39,354 --> 00:18:40,443
You got that one!

185
00:18:45,935 --> 00:18:46,935
Coach!

186
00:18:48,343 --> 00:18:50,519
How 'bout that? Hard at work, huh?

187
00:18:51,842 --> 00:18:55,228
Thank you sir... We hope that
you will continue coaching us!

188
00:18:55,356 --> 00:18:56,713
Thank you!

189
00:19:01,013 --> 00:19:03,257
We did the best we could and lost.

190
00:19:04,303 --> 00:19:08,078
Seijoh beat us... That proves they're the better team.

191
00:19:08,497 --> 00:19:11,373
You can like it or not, but
that's what happened out there.

192
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:17,665
I'm sure you're all interested to know
who the winner of the Inter-High final was.

193
00:19:22,181 --> 00:19:23,694
It was Shiratorizawa.

194
00:19:26,605 --> 00:19:28,217
Are you telling me that...

195
00:19:28,451 --> 00:19:29,851
Seijoh lost?

196
00:19:35,461 --> 00:19:38,155
So Seijoh's not the best in our prefecture.

197
00:19:38,441 --> 00:19:40,020
We need to step it up!

198
00:19:40,528 --> 00:19:43,340
I'm sure you already know what our next focus is.

199
00:19:44,282 --> 00:19:45,658
Spring Nationals...

200
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:49,990
And obviously, that'll be the
last game for the third-year players.

201
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:54,252
I can't wait to play in the same place the Tiny Giant did!

202
00:19:55,412 --> 00:19:59,456
Actually, I'd like to hear some
inspiring words from the captain himself.

203
00:20:04,061 --> 00:20:06,973
The venue... is Tokyo's Orange Court.

204
00:20:07,701 --> 00:20:09,943
Karasuno's only been once.

205
00:20:11,983 --> 00:20:14,333
Let's go back... and do it again!

206
00:20:20,959 --> 00:20:22,623
ALL RIGHT!

207
00:20:40,044 --> 00:20:41,267
Take five!

208
00:20:41,419 --> 00:20:42,526
Yes sir!

209
00:21:11,703 --> 00:21:12,504
Kageyama.

210
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:17,170
We're gonna win it this time. You wait and see.

211
00:21:18,843 --> 00:21:21,458
You and me... and our team!

212
00:21:24,215 --> 00:21:24,789
Yeah.

213
00:21:26,073 --> 00:21:28,197
Break time's over, love birds!

214
00:21:28,222 --> 00:21:28,817
Sir!

215
00:21:37,494 --> 00:21:41,121
There's a big, tall wall in front of me, blocking my way.

216
00:21:41,961 --> 00:21:43,466
Practice your spikes!

217
00:21:43,504 --> 00:21:44,646
Yes sir!

218
00:21:45,431 --> 00:21:46,477
Here we go!

219
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:51,438
I'll never be able to see over that wall on my own,

220
00:21:52,106 --> 00:21:54,420
not without my teammates by my side.

221
00:22:00,371 --> 00:22:01,894
You're up next, Ginger!

222
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:03,309
Ready, sir!

223
00:22:10,241 --> 00:22:11,425
Bring it to me!

224
00:22:17,515 --> 00:22:21,993
I get it now! That's the view from the top!
