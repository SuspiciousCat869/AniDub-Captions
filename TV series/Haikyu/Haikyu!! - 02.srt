1
00:00:07,265 --> 00:00:12,317
My first and last real game in middle
school... we got our butts kicked.

2
00:00:13,419 --> 00:00:18,847
We lost to the king of the court, and I
swore I'd challenge him to a revenge match.

3
00:00:19,777 --> 00:00:23,309
After all that happened, I
enrolled at Karasuno high school.

4
00:00:23,691 --> 00:00:24,404
But now...

5
00:00:28,538 --> 00:00:30,196
No... wait...

6
00:02:08,507 --> 00:02:11,943
Why? What is this guy doing at Karasuno?

7
00:02:12,875 --> 00:02:15,194
No... it's gotta be somebody else.

8
00:02:15,695 --> 00:02:17,710
Why did you come to this tournament anyway?

9
00:02:17,735 --> 00:02:20,021
Not giving up is a lot easier said than done!

10
00:02:20,046 --> 00:02:22,017
I'm gonna be the one in the winner's court!

11
00:02:22,042 --> 00:02:24,455
What did you waste your time on for three years, huh?!

12
00:02:24,613 --> 00:02:29,748
Nope, it's him. That jerk really is here! Tobio Kageyama.

13
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:32,898
We met last year. I forgot your name.

14
00:02:33,494 --> 00:02:36,176
M-My name's Shoyo Hinata, okay?!

15
00:02:36,578 --> 00:02:39,570
But I'm sure you don't even remember who
I am. I mean, you destroyed us in one game!

16
00:02:39,595 --> 00:02:41,724
I remember exactly who you are.

17
00:02:43,123 --> 00:02:46,917
He's got amazing reflexes, he
can jump high, and he's fast.

18
00:02:47,831 --> 00:02:49,772
But he doesn't use those
abilities to their full potential.

19
00:02:49,797 --> 00:02:51,384
What's with the silent treatment?!

20
00:02:51,805 --> 00:02:53,784
What, you wanna fight or something?!

21
00:02:53,809 --> 00:02:55,379
Oh, don't be a dumbass!

22
00:02:57,198 --> 00:02:57,605
Er...

23
00:02:57,823 --> 00:02:59,208
Don't make fun of me!

24
00:02:59,335 --> 00:03:03,323
I might've lost really bad the
first time we met... but never again!

25
00:03:06,481 --> 00:03:10,818
Look! I came here to get my revenge and now I
find out you're gonna be on the same team as me?!

26
00:03:10,843 --> 00:03:12,987
How am I supposed to kick your butt that way?!

27
00:03:13,012 --> 00:03:14,942
There's tons of better schools you could have gone to!

28
00:03:14,967 --> 00:03:18,217
Why'd you have to pick this one?
Why didn't you go to one of those instead?

29
00:03:18,726 --> 00:03:21,413
I applied to the school with the best team...

30
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:23,228
But...

31
00:03:23,724 --> 00:03:24,689
Didn't make it.

32
00:03:26,746 --> 00:03:27,809
You didn't?

33
00:03:28,206 --> 00:03:30,312
They rejected the king of the court?

34
00:03:31,592 --> 00:03:34,365
Never call me that... ever!

35
00:03:36,511 --> 00:03:40,159
Who knew the setter from Kitagawa
first would end up at our school?

36
00:03:40,368 --> 00:03:42,756
He better not be too cocky. Or I'll have to pound him one.

37
00:03:42,813 --> 00:03:45,608
Give it a rest, Tanaka... you
don't have to threaten everybody.

38
00:03:45,657 --> 00:03:49,441
What are you gonna do about it,
huh? Yeah, that's what I thought.

39
00:03:49,513 --> 00:03:50,319
Uh... hello.

40
00:03:56,657 --> 00:04:00,313
Well, well, well... Now what do we have here-.

41
00:04:00,338 --> 00:04:01,368
You Kageyama?

42
00:04:01,497 --> 00:04:02,069
Yeah.

43
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:03,584
It's nice to meet you.

44
00:04:03,609 --> 00:04:04,803
Pretty tall, aren'tcha?

45
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:09,791
First impressions are everything, Suga!
You're a third-year, so you have to establish dominance!

46
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:12,332
Stop it, Tanaka... you look stupid.

47
00:04:12,676 --> 00:04:14,724
Kageyama's a little taller than them...

48
00:04:15,195 --> 00:04:17,934
But wow, these high schoolers are all pretty huge!

49
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:22,089
I can't believe I'm really here! This'll be great!

50
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:23,408
Hey guys!

51
00:04:23,433 --> 00:04:24,503
So how tall are you?

52
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:25,007
Uh..

53
00:04:25,032 --> 00:04:25,439
Six feet.

54
00:04:25,464 --> 00:04:25,832
Hey dudes?

55
00:04:26,302 --> 00:04:26,905
Six feet?

56
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:27,159
Excuse me?

57
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:28,208
That's badass.

58
00:04:28,398 --> 00:04:29,264
Hey!

59
00:04:31,086 --> 00:04:33,936
Huh? Hey.. It's you!

60
00:04:34,614 --> 00:04:35,675
You're the shorty!

61
00:04:37,297 --> 00:04:42,594
Wait a minute... So the other applicant goes by
the name of Shoyo Hinata... I guess that's you?

62
00:04:43,691 --> 00:04:46,235
It's just... kind of surprising, that's all...

63
00:04:46,507 --> 00:04:50,792
But hey! You guys both chose Kurasuno!

64
00:04:51,297 --> 00:04:52,090
Guess so...

65
00:04:52,184 --> 00:04:55,424
Didn't mean to freak you out，
it's just you made a big impression last year.

66
00:04:55,682 --> 00:04:58,970
Yeah, you were tiny and all over the
place, but you really had some spunk!

67
00:04:58,995 --> 00:05:00,559
Wow, thanks a lot!

68
00:05:00,584 --> 00:05:02,624
And not to mention that jump of yours.

69
00:05:02,665 --> 00:05:05,097
It's too bad you haven't hit a growth spurt yet though.

70
00:05:07,251 --> 00:05:12,616
I know! I may be small, but I've got talent!
I'll be karasuno's ace before you know it!

71
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:19,435
Hot damn! Already got your eyeballs on the
ace position, do ya? Somebody's got cajones.

72
00:05:19,881 --> 00:05:23,111
Well, there's nothing wrong with
shooting for the stars, is there? Right?

73
00:05:24,034 --> 00:05:25,751
Yeah! I'll do my best!

74
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:28,929
Okay then... Now that you've sworn to become the ace...

75
00:05:29,407 --> 00:05:31,557
You'd better be prepared to back it up.

76
00:05:31,896 --> 00:05:35,213
If you're not careful, you'll waste another three years.

77
00:05:35,695 --> 00:05:37,271
Excuse me?

78
00:05:40,822 --> 00:05:43,146
Was that really necessary, Kageyama?

79
00:05:43,513 --> 00:05:45,144
I did everything I could!

80
00:05:45,988 --> 00:05:46,767
I did!

81
00:05:50,461 --> 00:05:54,701
Look... I've done a lot! Stop putting me down!

82
00:05:58,136 --> 00:06:03,165
Relax, guys... you know you're not enemies anymore, right?
Volleyball supposed to bring people together-

83
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:05,001
I want you to play me right now!

84
00:06:05,026 --> 00:06:07,414
Whoa, watch it, punk, don't you
know Daichi's talking to you?!

85
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:08,526
What are we gonna play?

86
00:06:08,551 --> 00:06:10,607
Volleyball, what the heck else is there?!

87
00:06:10,981 --> 00:06:13,430
How do you plan to play volleyball one-on-one?

88
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,881
Like, passes and stuff!

89
00:06:14,923 --> 00:06:16,424
How does anybody win at that?

90
00:06:17,404 --> 00:06:18,680
The kid's got a point!

91
00:06:18,705 --> 00:06:20,356
What's all the noise in here?

92
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:24,777
Oh turds, VP...

93
00:06:24,802 --> 00:06:25,802
Be quiet!

94
00:06:25,827 --> 00:06:26,868
Why don't you be quiet!

95
00:06:26,893 --> 00:06:28,921
Are you boys fighting in here?

96
00:06:28,977 --> 00:06:32,325
No, we're just working hard as
always, vice principal, right?

97
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:36,355
We gotta watch ourselves around the vice
principal. That guy's always waiting for us to slip up!

98
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:39,245
Serve it to me! I can handle whatever you send!

99
00:06:39,385 --> 00:06:40,324
Dude!

100
00:06:40,396 --> 00:06:44,211
Listen, jerk... I only received
one serve from you last year...

101
00:06:44,514 --> 00:06:49,319
Granted it was with my face.
But since then I've practiced with everyone I could!

102
00:06:51,011 --> 00:06:53,132
I am not the same person I was!

103
00:06:53,476 --> 00:06:54,008
Hmph.

104
00:06:55,202 --> 00:06:56,643
Not the same person, huh?

105
00:07:01,756 --> 00:07:04,177
Well, I've improved a bit in the last year too.

106
00:07:04,202 --> 00:07:07,709
Alright, alright... that's enough smack-talk, you guys.

107
00:07:07,757 --> 00:07:09,736
They're both first-years, aren't they?

108
00:07:09,916 --> 00:07:14,463
Don't let him get to you. Remember everything
you learned from practicing with the ladies' team!

109
00:07:15,792 --> 00:07:16,577
Get ready.

110
00:07:18,153 --> 00:07:20,389
A jump serve?! That's new.

111
00:07:28,736 --> 00:07:29,784
Not even I could catch that!

112
00:07:29,809 --> 00:07:33,236
I never saw a serve like that from
any of the ladies I played with...

113
00:07:33,818 --> 00:07:36,488
Pathetic. How's that different than last year?

114
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:41,024
One more try.

115
00:07:41,408 --> 00:07:42,757
Okay... now cut it out.

116
00:07:42,782 --> 00:07:46,019
I see the new recruits have no respect for their captain.

117
00:07:51,202 --> 00:07:52,247
Nice reflexes!

118
00:07:52,528 --> 00:07:54,917
He got right behind it, now he can control it.

119
00:07:55,186 --> 00:07:56,091
If this keeps-.

120
00:07:58,352 --> 00:07:59,034
Or not...

121
00:08:07,012 --> 00:08:08,955
Oh man, that was a toupee?

122
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:12,664
You just now figured that out? I
noticed it at the entrance ceremony.

123
00:08:13,103 --> 00:08:15,911
Dude! Shut up! It's not even that funny!

124
00:08:16,072 --> 00:08:17,817
You shut up, Moron!

125
00:08:18,169 --> 00:08:20,629
Captain... a word please?

126
00:08:24,057 --> 00:08:27,622
Luckily, we're not in trouble.
He doesn't even want an apology.

127
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:31,609
But we have been sworn to secrecy.

128
00:08:33,872 --> 00:08:35,461
And as for if you two...

129
00:08:35,485 --> 00:08:37,943
If you'd handled the serve, it wouldn't
have happened in the first place!

130
00:08:38,104 --> 00:08:41,505
You're the same klutz you were last year. I
can't believe I thought you'd be a challenge.

131
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:42,587
You don't know when to quit, do you?

132
00:08:42,612 --> 00:08:46,404
Can it! There's something I want to tell you.

133
00:08:47,062 --> 00:08:50,268
I don't know what your reasons were for
choosing to come to this high school...

134
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:52,478
But... I assume you came to win.

135
00:08:52,503 --> 00:08:53,135
Yeah!

136
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,238
Yes, obviously.

137
00:08:54,263 --> 00:08:59,326
Up until a few years ago, Karasuno's volleyball
team could compete with the best of them...

138
00:08:59,358 --> 00:09:01,753
They even made it to nationals once.

139
00:09:01,802 --> 00:09:04,778
But these days we're 8th in the prefecture.

140
00:09:05,055 --> 00:09:10,169
Not terrible, but not good either.
And people talk. They call us...

141
00:09:10,692 --> 00:09:12,709
The wingless crows.

142
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:17,195
I remember when Karasuno played in
the Spring High National Tournament...

143
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:21,754
I was a student at a nearby school who
just happened to be in the neighborhood.

144
00:09:22,327 --> 00:09:26,448
Watching them fight those tough
opponents in that huge gym in Tokyo...

145
00:09:27,429 --> 00:09:28,653
It gave me chills.

146
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:36,456
Let's go back.. One more time!

147
00:09:47,653 --> 00:09:51,177
We're going to play on the
same court the tiny giant played!

148
00:09:52,245 --> 00:09:53,501
The nationals, huh?

149
00:09:54,354 --> 00:09:58,449
Plenty of high schools talk about making
it there one day... Doesn't mean they'll go.

150
00:09:58,489 --> 00:09:59,195
Wha-?! You little...

151
00:09:59,228 --> 00:10:02,769
I know what you mean. But I'm dead serious.

152
00:10:03,815 --> 00:10:07,155
If we want to get there, we need to be a cohesive unit.

153
00:10:07,259 --> 00:10:10,540
That means no more run-ins with the VP, for one thing.

154
00:10:12,469 --> 00:10:15,903
It's not like I'm telling you to be
best friends or anything like that.

155
00:10:16,769 --> 00:10:21,444
I know back in middle school you two might
have been adversaries on opposite sides of the net...

156
00:10:21,979 --> 00:10:27,077
But let me be clear... you're on one side
now and you need to make peace with that.

157
00:10:28,034 --> 00:10:29,180
Is that clear?

158
00:10:30,847 --> 00:10:32,915
I don't care how good you are.

159
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:35,839
Or how determined you are to play hard.

160
00:10:36,823 --> 00:10:41,561
Anyone who lets a petty rivalry get
in the way of the team's success...

161
00:10:42,442 --> 00:10:43,863
Gets the boot!

162
00:10:44,434 --> 00:10:49,661
You two are banned from participating in club activities
until you learn to think of yourselves as teammates!

163
00:11:01,347 --> 00:11:03,167
Huh?!

164
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:25,820
"L-Learn to think of ourselves
as teammates"?! What's that mean?!

165
00:11:25,982 --> 00:11:26,983
Beats me!

166
00:11:27,008 --> 00:11:30,133
Please let me in, captain! Please
let me play volleyball with you!

167
00:11:30,203 --> 00:11:32,838
I'll find a way to get along with Kageyama, I promise!

168
00:11:32,863 --> 00:11:34,579
Come on, I'm really sorry! I'll do anything!

169
00:11:34,604 --> 00:11:36,256
Are you sure this is wise?

170
00:11:36,281 --> 00:11:41,537
I mean we need players. You can't build a team
by threatening people to cooperate. It takes time.

171
00:11:41,562 --> 00:11:43,381
Yeah I know... but...

172
00:11:45,549 --> 00:11:50,839
I apologize! I won't pick any more fights with him!
Please let me be on the team!

173
00:11:55,387 --> 00:11:56,442
You mean that?

174
00:12:04,913 --> 00:12:10,654
I can do it. I'll share the court with him if I have to...
But I still want to do it all myself...

175
00:12:10,956 --> 00:12:13,093
Every spike, receive and set in the game.

176
00:12:13,118 --> 00:12:14,852
What is wrong with you?!

177
00:12:16,845 --> 00:12:22,819
I wasn't expecting you to be that honest with me...
Hey, well, it's good enough for now... but you know...

178
00:12:23,231 --> 00:12:27,989
In volleyball, it's against the rules to
drop, carry, or touch the ball twice in a row...

179
00:12:28,168 --> 00:12:31,845
In other words, this game is impossible to play alone.

180
00:12:36,221 --> 00:12:39,258
So are you mean... Or just stupid?

181
00:12:43,043 --> 00:12:43,829
Go right!

182
00:12:46,681 --> 00:12:48,420
Tanaka, follow through with your block!

183
00:12:48,454 --> 00:12:49,223
Sure thing, boss!

184
00:12:49,248 --> 00:12:53,239
There's a court and a ball right
in front of me. It's such a tease.

185
00:12:53,326 --> 00:12:58,172
Ugh! This is such a stupid waste
of time! I have to get back in there!

186
00:12:58,593 --> 00:13:00,629
But we're not teammates yet, are we?

187
00:13:00,836 --> 00:13:02,489
I have a lot of potential!

188
00:13:02,607 --> 00:13:05,574
That should be more than enough
for them to let me join the team.

189
00:13:06,277 --> 00:13:10,331
Spoken like a true ki... uh.. So what are you gonna do?

190
00:13:10,371 --> 00:13:14,346
We'll challenge them to a two-on-two and
if we win then they have to let us join...

191
00:13:14,537 --> 00:13:19,163
That way we can at least look like we're
working together as teammates... it's foolproof.

192
00:13:19,295 --> 00:13:23,073
Y-You mean we have to beat them?! What if we lose?

193
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:25,719
We won't lose... I'll make sure.

194
00:13:26,672 --> 00:13:29,794
Whoa, is he serious?! Does he even hear himself?!

195
00:13:29,984 --> 00:13:35,125
You need to do the you best you can. No screw-ups.
Do not drag me down, understand?

196
00:13:36,509 --> 00:13:41,807
Huh?! Don't talk to me like that! Who's ever
gonna listen to you if you treat them like trash?!

197
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,518
Then what's your plan?

198
00:13:44,012 --> 00:13:47,075
Just sit here and watch through the window forever?

199
00:13:49,536 --> 00:13:54,918
My first game... and my only game...
Was the time we played against you.

200
00:13:55,498 --> 00:14:00,060
We never had enough players for tournaments
before that, and I had no place to play.

201
00:14:00,266 --> 00:14:05,144
So I used to practice in the corner of the gym
or in an empty hallway, or wherever I could.

202
00:14:05,169 --> 00:14:05,882
Really?

203
00:14:07,394 --> 00:14:09,204
So when I got to play my first game...

204
00:14:09,756 --> 00:14:12,301
And I stood in the middle of that huge gymnasium...

205
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:18,812
I felt like the main character
in a movie. It was like, "whoaaaa!"

206
00:14:19,748 --> 00:14:20,636
"Whoa?"

207
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,178
I wanted to stay forever.

208
00:14:24,877 --> 00:14:26,547
But only the strongest...

209
00:14:28,717 --> 00:14:30,330
Get to stay on the court.

210
00:14:31,148 --> 00:14:34,720
Anyway... they're not gonna let
one of us in without the other.

211
00:14:35,343 --> 00:14:36,917
If I get to play volleyball...

212
00:14:39,163 --> 00:14:42,134
Then nothing's too much to deal with.. Not even you!

213
00:14:42,331 --> 00:14:45,314
If I try not to look at you.. I
don't have to see your dumb face!

214
00:14:45,339 --> 00:14:47,337
Keep talking, short stack!

215
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:48,523
Excuse me.

216
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:56,920
I... need to get through.

217
00:15:06,732 --> 00:15:09,559
Hey Kiyoko! Thanks for your hard work! Let me get that...

218
00:15:09,584 --> 00:15:11,547
No, thanks. I can carry it myself.

219
00:15:11,572 --> 00:15:14,102
Okay then... you look super gorgeous today.

220
00:15:16,316 --> 00:15:18,927
Ohhh man, she's so pretty when she ignores me!

221
00:15:25,512 --> 00:15:26,945
Good work, everybody!

222
00:15:28,451 --> 00:15:30,827
You know what I bet those two
goofballs are thinking right now.

223
00:15:30,852 --> 00:15:33,190
That if they can beat us, then
they'll make the team, right?

224
00:15:33,215 --> 00:15:38,280
Yeah sure... but all they really have to do is cool off
and prove to everybody that they've learned their lesson.

225
00:15:39,274 --> 00:15:40,040
Captain!

226
00:15:40,851 --> 00:15:41,596
Huh!

227
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:43,964
We challenge you to a match!

228
00:15:43,989 --> 00:15:46,298
If we win, you have to let us join!

229
00:15:46,371 --> 00:15:48,292
Guys, I'm psychic!

230
00:15:48,372 --> 00:15:49,238
Now!

231
00:15:49,517 --> 00:15:53,831
We want to prove that we finally
understand how to play together as teammates!

232
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:56,055
How many times did you rehearse that?

233
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:59,687
This is gold! I could get used
to having these clowns on the team!

234
00:15:59,712 --> 00:16:00,956
If you lose?

235
00:16:01,959 --> 00:16:03,967
Then you get to choose the penalty!

236
00:16:04,379 --> 00:16:05,162
Huh...

237
00:16:06,212 --> 00:16:11,390
Club application form. Here's an idea...
We have two other first-years joining the club soon.

238
00:16:11,415 --> 00:16:14,474
You'll play against them in a three-on-three match.

239
00:16:15,799 --> 00:16:20,500
We do this game every year with our new club members
so we can get an idea of how they play.

240
00:16:21,183 --> 00:16:25,170
But if it's gonna be three-on-three...
then whose going to be our third player?

241
00:16:25,195 --> 00:16:28,887
Tanaka... you're with them...
make sure they behave, alright?

242
00:16:29,038 --> 00:16:30,526
Aww man, why me?

243
00:16:30,709 --> 00:16:32,244
Well you seem to like them.

244
00:16:32,293 --> 00:16:33,872
Don't drag me into their mess!

245
00:16:34,923 --> 00:16:35,827
That's too bad.

246
00:16:36,011 --> 00:16:39,628
I was thinking you'd be the only one tough
enough to keep these delinquents in line.

247
00:16:41,027 --> 00:16:44,754
Aww well, why the heck not? When you put it like that...

248
00:16:45,853 --> 00:16:47,822
Just stick with me, little man!

249
00:16:47,847 --> 00:16:52,929
Anyway, here's the penalty if you lose. For
the remainder of my time here at Karasuno...

250
00:16:53,556 --> 00:16:55,858
Kageyama cannot be the setter.

251
00:16:56,301 --> 00:16:56,883
Huh?

252
00:16:57,399 --> 00:16:59,796
Is that the only penalty we have, sir?

253
00:16:59,986 --> 00:17:05,677
If the setter is aggressive, self-centered,
and driven by his own ego... the team can't win.

254
00:17:07,584 --> 00:17:13,914
What? I'm not saying I'll reject your application to join.
I'm sure you'll be well-suited to a different position.

255
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:16,703
No way, I'm a setter!

256
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:18,579
Then win the game.

257
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:22,280
You're the one who thought you
could win without help, right?

258
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,167
Hey, uh.. But what about me?!

259
00:17:25,192 --> 00:17:26,826
We play on Saturday.

260
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:30,054
Come on! I'm over here too, you know?

261
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:33,197
Don't worry! Your cool upperclassman's
gonna show you the ro-waahh!

262
00:17:33,757 --> 00:17:34,755
See ya!

263
00:17:38,742 --> 00:17:41,826
Daichi... are you being a little too harsh?

264
00:17:42,165 --> 00:17:44,973
He's right, boss, you're acting
a lot more strict than usual.

265
00:17:45,413 --> 00:17:47,771
Yeah, is there some special reason you're doing this?

266
00:17:49,585 --> 00:17:50,417
Dammit!

267
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:54,433
What's wrong? Are you mad because
you're the only one who gets penalized?

268
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:58,835
Even if you're not a setter, I bet you'd
figure out a different position just like that!

269
00:18:00,009 --> 00:18:04,113
Plus... spikers are cooler than setters anyway!

270
00:18:04,138 --> 00:18:06,171
They get to go up and slam the ball!

271
00:18:06,802 --> 00:18:08,610
Shut up!

272
00:18:08,888 --> 00:18:11,500
The setter is the team's control tower!

273
00:18:11,619 --> 00:18:15,214
Plus, it's the position that
gets the most contact with the ball!

274
00:18:15,239 --> 00:18:18,483
It's the greatest position there
is because you get to be the ruler!

275
00:18:18,739 --> 00:18:22,824
Without a setter to toss the ball, there
wouldn't be any spikes for you to hit!

276
00:18:22,849 --> 00:18:28,084
I know, but even though the setter has an important job,
you don't really stand out very much, do you?

277
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:33,946
I'm guessing you've never seen a major
volleyball tournament in person, have you?

278
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:34,907
No.

279
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:40,405
You can't tell by the angle they show on TV,
but pay attention to the end of the court...

280
00:18:40,855 --> 00:18:44,084
From there, you can see how
fast the setter tosses the ball.

281
00:18:44,588 --> 00:18:47,273
It flies straight across the court... woah!

282
00:18:47,305 --> 00:18:50,751
The ball passes right in front of the face of
the other team's blockers... then!

283
00:18:50,777 --> 00:18:53,962
Just when you start to think "no
way! He's never gonna hit that one!"

284
00:18:54,072 --> 00:18:59,535
There's a spiker just waiting to strike...
and he smashes the ball in just in time!

285
00:19:00,449 --> 00:19:01,882
Y-Yeah...

286
00:19:02,846 --> 00:19:06,060
The spiker's job may be flashier... but...

287
00:19:06,797 --> 00:19:11,552
The spiker can't get through without the setter
to get the opponent to block and break the wall!

288
00:19:11,862 --> 00:19:15,798
It's the most important, cool, and
challenging position on the court, okay?!

289
00:19:16,386 --> 00:19:19,032
Yeah sure, fine, I get it, you wanna be the setter.

290
00:19:19,129 --> 00:19:21,610
Kageyama cannot be the setter.

291
00:19:22,093 --> 00:19:24,644
Dammit! What's with that guy?!

292
00:19:25,347 --> 00:19:30,147
All you have to do is win. You seemed pretty
confident when you challenged them to a match earlier.

293
00:19:31,203 --> 00:19:36,654
He's right. Not that he'll be any help. I'll just
focus on setting up tosses for that creepy second-year.

294
00:19:37,297 --> 00:19:41,301
Okay! We've got until Saturday
to work on your crappy receiving!

295
00:19:41,381 --> 00:19:44,746
Crappy?! Uh, but we can't get into the gym...

296
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:45,548
Huh...

297
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:46,662
Ahem!

298
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:52,838
I forget... we start practice at 7 am tomorrow, don't we?

299
00:19:52,872 --> 00:19:55,123
Uh, yeah...? Is that a problem?

300
00:19:55,148 --> 00:20:00,007
Ah! Not at all... a-anyway, do you think the
vice principal's nappy rug made it out alive?

301
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:02,706
We're not supposed to talk about that...

302
00:20:02,731 --> 00:20:03,662
Alright then.

303
00:20:05,152 --> 00:20:06,121
5 am.

304
00:20:06,146 --> 00:20:07,215
Don't be late.

305
00:20:07,303 --> 00:20:08,183
I won't.

306
00:20:15,986 --> 00:20:18,415
Ah, wait! Hang on, I forgot my bag!

307
00:20:22,477 --> 00:20:24,206
Shoulda seen that coming.

308
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:25,479
It's locked.

309
00:20:26,009 --> 00:20:27,544
Okay, let's go through the window.

310
00:20:27,635 --> 00:20:29,768
Are you crazy?! We'd end up getting expelled!

311
00:20:29,793 --> 00:20:33,200
Man, 5 am is too early...

312
00:20:33,303 --> 00:20:34,106
Tanaka?!

313
00:20:35,578 --> 00:20:37,887
You got 2 hours... and then beat it!

314
00:20:39,677 --> 00:20:41,001
You're awesome!

315
00:20:41,026 --> 00:20:41,723
Thank you!

316
00:20:42,917 --> 00:20:46,492
Yeah, who's your hero, first-years? Call me sir Tanaka!

317
00:20:46,517 --> 00:20:47,746
Sir Tanaka!

318
00:20:49,026 --> 00:20:49,803
What was that?

319
00:20:50,188 --> 00:20:51,418
Sir Tanaka!

320
00:20:52,662 --> 00:20:54,682
Okay, punks, let's get crackin'!

321
00:20:56,812 --> 00:20:59,733
He's right, boss, you're acting
a lot more strict than usual.

322
00:21:00,747 --> 00:21:03,159
Yeah, is there some special reason you're doing this?

323
00:21:03,844 --> 00:21:08,131
Well, sort of... you saw those
two play last year... think back.

324
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:13,704
Kageyama had exceptional talent for a middle schooler,
but now he's got almost nothing to show for it...

325
00:21:13,729 --> 00:21:18,832
If nothing changes, that lone wolf personality
of his will hold him back in high school too.

326
00:21:19,169 --> 00:21:23,757
I don't want him dragging this team
down... the big difference now is...

327
00:21:24,685 --> 00:21:27,517
That he and Hinata are on the same team.

328
00:21:28,237 --> 00:21:33,299
What, Hinata? Oh yeah, I guess he's
kind of a crazy ball of energy and agility.

329
00:21:33,624 --> 00:21:36,315
Right, but he hasn't reached his potential.

330
00:21:36,842 --> 00:21:41,594
He's got incredible speed and quick
reflexes, not to mention that jumping power...

331
00:21:41,627 --> 00:21:44,373
But he never played with a real setter before.

332
00:21:44,786 --> 00:21:49,443
Kageyama, on the other hand, wants a
spiker fast enough to hit the sets he makes.

333
00:21:49,718 --> 00:21:54,091
Separately, their abilities are
limited. But put them together...

334
00:22:00,361 --> 00:22:03,011
And let them work on some combinations...

335
00:22:03,998 --> 00:22:06,833
Karasuno will have the perfect team!

336
00:22:08,378 --> 00:22:10,409
It's gonna be fantastic.

337
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,260
Outta my way! I'm gonna be the first one on that court!

338
00:22:13,285 --> 00:22:16,360
You can't be first if Tanaka's already in, dumb-ass!

339
00:22:16,385 --> 00:22:18,220
Then why don't you let me go!?

340
00:22:18,432 --> 00:22:20,156
We don't have time for this...

341
00:22:22,371 --> 00:22:25,510
Sorry, boss, we've got a long
way to go on those combinations.

342
00:22:27,568 --> 00:22:29,976
Wow, check it out!

343
00:22:30,001 --> 00:22:31,897
You were just here yesterday.

344
00:22:32,753 --> 00:22:35,978
This is the same gym where
the tiny giant used to practice.

345
00:22:37,704 --> 00:22:41,310
Alright! Let's do this!

346
00:24:13,888 --> 00:24:15,998
Leave it to you to ruin things from the start.

347
00:24:16,023 --> 00:24:18,704
What?! You're the one who
thinks you can play without a team!

348
00:24:18,729 --> 00:24:20,417
I'd rather go it alone than work with you!

349
00:24:20,442 --> 00:24:21,419
Why are you so stubborn?!

350
00:24:21,451 --> 00:24:22,506
Clock's ticking!

351
00:24:22,596 --> 00:24:24,228
Less yapping, more practicing!

352
00:24:24,253 --> 00:24:24,882
Right!

353
00:24:25,184 --> 00:24:27,611
Next Haikyu, "the most powerful ally."
