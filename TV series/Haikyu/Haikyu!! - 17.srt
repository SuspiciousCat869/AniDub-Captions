1
00:00:09,337 --> 00:00:12,187
It's been three months since they defeated us.

2
00:00:13,077 --> 00:00:17,871
The wall just fades away, and then the
view of the other side is totally clear!

3
00:00:19,492 --> 00:00:23,330
In the past, I'd been able to
see the view he was talking about...

4
00:00:24,874 --> 00:00:29,377
But when faced with that iron wall,
I couldn't picture anything beyond it.

5
00:00:31,213 --> 00:00:35,650
I still wonder... what it must look like over there.

6
00:00:36,716 --> 00:00:38,554
Rollinggggg...

7
00:00:38,645 --> 00:00:39,003
Um...

8
00:00:40,421 --> 00:00:43,152
Thundeeeeeeer!

9
00:00:43,284 --> 00:00:44,112
Again!

10
00:00:46,598 --> 00:00:50,414
Alright, listen here! You guys
have nothing to be afraid of at all!

11
00:00:50,462 --> 00:00:51,115
Um?

12
00:00:51,476 --> 00:00:53,219
Focus on what's in front of you!

13
00:00:54,205 --> 00:00:56,540
I promise I'll always have your back.

14
00:00:58,866 --> 00:01:01,554
Whoa... he's amazing!

15
00:01:05,751 --> 00:01:06,549
Line up!

16
00:01:13,152 --> 00:01:14,629
Thank you for the game!

17
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:51,671
Go, go, Date Tech, Date Tech, here we go!

18
00:02:51,696 --> 00:02:52,819
Listen to me, boys.

19
00:02:53,682 --> 00:02:56,180
So Karasuno surprised us with that quick attack...

20
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:59,364
But it was just the spiker's
height that threw us off, that's all.

21
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:04,877
Despite that incredible jumping power, at the end
of the day, all he did was a normal quick attack.

22
00:03:05,222 --> 00:03:06,396
Don't lose sight of that.

23
00:03:06,797 --> 00:03:09,383
Just don't let him or that ace
of theirs score a single point!

24
00:03:10,578 --> 00:03:12,307
They know we're the iron wall...

25
00:03:12,498 --> 00:03:15,213
So get out there... And remind them!

26
00:03:15,238 --> 00:03:16,160
Yes sir!

27
00:03:17,492 --> 00:03:19,458
From what they showed us in round one...

28
00:03:19,984 --> 00:03:22,565
I'm thinking they'll come out
strong with their first serve...

29
00:03:22,894 --> 00:03:25,957
They as notorious for their
serves as they are for their blocks.

30
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:29,634
Date Tech's strategy is to tank
their opponents' morale from the get-go.

31
00:03:30,088 --> 00:03:33,543
So let's be sure to receive high
on the first one, you guys got that?

32
00:03:33,568 --> 00:03:34,513
Right!

33
00:03:35,241 --> 00:03:37,604
Oh, and... you know what to do, Don'cha?

34
00:03:37,891 --> 00:03:38,415
Yeah.

35
00:03:39,463 --> 00:03:43,523
Perfect... make me proud, team! Let's clear that wall!

36
00:03:43,633 --> 00:03:44,462
Sir!

37
00:03:45,595 --> 00:03:47,955
Karasunoooo... fight!

38
00:03:48,486 --> 00:03:50,123
Fiiiight!

39
00:03:52,642 --> 00:03:55,678
Hey, looks like Karasuno's
starting their ace in the back row.

40
00:03:56,515 --> 00:04:00,149
Right, probably because that's the
strongest formation for receiving.

41
00:04:01,755 --> 00:04:04,232
Date's in the same position as the first round.

42
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,869
You can do it!

43
00:04:13,939 --> 00:04:14,691
Let's go!

44
00:04:14,716 --> 00:04:15,478
Bring it on!

45
00:04:15,503 --> 00:04:16,597
Do it, Kamasaki!

46
00:04:16,726 --> 00:04:17,574
Serve's up!

47
00:04:20,073 --> 00:04:20,767
Daichi!

48
00:04:21,691 --> 00:04:22,541
Nice receive!

49
00:04:24,401 --> 00:04:28,881
His form is flawless. He's able to mask
where he plans to send the set... but...

50
00:04:40,372 --> 00:04:42,896
Sweet! Nice moves, Hinata!

51
00:04:46,762 --> 00:04:51,627
Uh-oh! So they did block it! And here I
was thinking we had them a step behind.

52
00:04:52,665 --> 00:04:54,522
Jumping after seeing the set.

53
00:04:54,827 --> 00:04:56,970
That's called read-blocking, right?

54
00:04:57,042 --> 00:04:57,670
Yeah.

55
00:04:58,147 --> 00:05:00,582
The other schools we've dealt with used "commit blocks",

56
00:05:00,607 --> 00:05:04,275
meaning they make the jump as soon as they
have a vague idea of where the set is headed.

57
00:05:04,786 --> 00:05:09,781
But Date Tech prefers hardcore read-blocking, meaning
they don't jump until they can see the set in motion.

58
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,882
In other words...

59
00:05:13,172 --> 00:05:15,714
it'll be almost impossible to fake them out.

60
00:05:17,378 --> 00:05:20,002
That would put them a step behind to block it, but...

61
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:23,593
That number 7... he's so damn big and so fast...

62
00:05:23,794 --> 00:05:25,436
He could close the gap, quick.

63
00:05:25,461 --> 00:05:27,007
Wow, that's scary.

64
00:05:27,795 --> 00:05:29,955
That read-blocking is gonna be a problem...

65
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:31,858
How do you think they're going to fight it?

66
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,046
Who knows?

67
00:05:33,133 --> 00:05:37,128
After all, Karasuno hasn't even brought
out the big guns in this tournament yet.

68
00:05:40,555 --> 00:05:41,907
Go for it, Kageyama!

69
00:05:41,932 --> 00:05:43,367
Yeah, get the point!

70
00:05:47,445 --> 00:05:49,969
Damn! It went straight to the libero!

71
00:05:51,016 --> 00:05:53,306
That was a pretty impressive serve, there...

72
00:05:53,469 --> 00:05:56,554
Now if he can just learn how to
control it, he'll be in business.

73
00:05:59,684 --> 00:06:00,695
Whoa, he saved it!

74
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,798
Amazing!

75
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:03,299
Tanaka, cover it!

76
00:06:03,324 --> 00:06:04,126
Gotcha!

77
00:06:04,227 --> 00:06:05,079
Back here!

78
00:06:05,589 --> 00:06:06,670
A back attack?!

79
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:09,244
There were barely any of those in the last game.

80
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:10,904
Hey, Asahi!

81
00:06:17,624 --> 00:06:18,309
Man...

82
00:06:18,471 --> 00:06:19,556
Oh, darn.

83
00:06:19,581 --> 00:06:21,743
Don't let it get you down! Keep moving!

84
00:06:22,337 --> 00:06:24,824
I'll get it next time! I'm so sorry.

85
00:06:26,436 --> 00:06:29,129
Thanks, but I don't mind... I'll do better too.

86
00:06:29,554 --> 00:06:33,420
C'mon, this is a sports tournament...
You should be at each other's throats!

87
00:06:33,445 --> 00:06:35,716
What good do you think that would do, Futakuchi?

88
00:06:35,741 --> 00:06:36,368
Ow!

89
00:06:49,864 --> 00:06:50,976
A net touch, huh?

90
00:06:51,001 --> 00:06:52,063
That was lucky!

91
00:06:52,318 --> 00:06:54,188
I-it's fine! Don't sweat it!

92
00:06:54,774 --> 00:06:59,447
They must be really happy that Date Tech hit
the net. Karasuno would have been in a lot of trouble.

93
00:07:00,146 --> 00:07:02,022
They're not half bad, though...

94
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:05,531
Their blocks and their quick attacks
seem to work fairly well together.

95
00:07:06,419 --> 00:07:07,789
They've got potential.

96
00:07:10,819 --> 00:07:11,810
Nice receive!

97
00:07:14,978 --> 00:07:15,878
I'm open!

98
00:07:16,283 --> 00:07:17,070
Asahi!

99
00:07:23,789 --> 00:07:26,984
Wait, I'm confused. Did we get a point for it being out?

100
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,810
Asahi, it's your serve!

101
00:07:34,421 --> 00:07:37,122
Karasuno's doing a good job of keeping the lead.

102
00:07:38,352 --> 00:07:41,349
But Date Tech's not giving them
enough room to make any spikes.

103
00:07:41,469 --> 00:07:43,819
Well, not the kind of spikes they need, anyway.

104
00:07:43,993 --> 00:07:45,107
Mm-hm.

105
00:07:45,391 --> 00:07:49,790
So far, they've been able to narrowly
avoid Date's blocks, but if they slip up once,

106
00:07:49,815 --> 00:07:51,682
they'll have the rug pulled out from under them.

107
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:53,010
Futakuchi!

108
00:07:54,793 --> 00:07:55,621
Nice one, Hinata!

109
00:07:55,646 --> 00:07:56,718
Seriously?

110
00:07:56,974 --> 00:07:58,023
Chance ball!

111
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:03,132
In a fraction of a second, we take what
was almost their point and make it our own.

112
00:08:05,158 --> 00:08:08,280
We break their spirits while boosting our own morale.

113
00:08:08,883 --> 00:08:11,640
The perfect marriage of offense and defense.

114
00:08:13,747 --> 00:08:15,654
That... is the block.

115
00:08:24,426 --> 00:08:25,457
Nice block!

116
00:08:25,974 --> 00:08:27,631
That was awesome, Aone!

117
00:08:27,655 --> 00:08:28,357
Ahha!

118
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:29,865
Awggggh...

119
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:33,534
They are called the iron wall...
And he's part of the reason.

120
00:08:36,342 --> 00:08:37,310
I was right.

121
00:08:39,095 --> 00:08:40,180
This is bad.

122
00:08:44,736 --> 00:08:46,017
Dangit!

123
00:08:46,212 --> 00:08:48,328
Just shake it off and stay focused.

124
00:08:48,386 --> 00:08:48,910
Huh?

125
00:08:49,533 --> 00:08:52,016
Trust me... the next one's ours.

126
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:53,104
You think so?

127
00:08:53,796 --> 00:08:57,855
Oh! You mean... time for whoosh?! And kaboom?!

128
00:08:57,926 --> 00:08:59,753
It's been quite a while, hasn't it?

129
00:09:00,408 --> 00:09:04,220
I'm gonna need your fastest
speed and your highest jump too.

130
00:09:04,715 --> 00:09:06,714
And I'll bring the ball straight to you.

131
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,519
You can count on it.

132
00:09:28,137 --> 00:09:31,704
Karasuno's probably going to use
that number 10 for their fastest attack.

133
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,915
Still, they won't be able to get around our iron wall.

134
00:09:37,282 --> 00:09:40,149
So why aren't they acting the least bit nervous?

135
00:09:42,197 --> 00:09:43,780
When we played against Nekoma...

136
00:09:44,366 --> 00:09:47,068
Who can tell me why our special technique didn't work?

137
00:09:47,236 --> 00:09:49,628
Ooh! 'Cause Inuoka's too awesome!

138
00:09:50,121 --> 00:09:53,829
That's uh... not quite the answer I
was looking for, but you're not wrong.

139
00:09:54,339 --> 00:09:56,109
It's because of their middle blocker...

140
00:09:56,189 --> 00:09:58,015
He learned Hinata's movements.

141
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,327
Uh-huh... that's it.

142
00:10:01,057 --> 00:10:02,314
That wasn't all though.

143
00:10:02,577 --> 00:10:07,152
Nekoma had another star player that made
things complicated for us. What was his name?

144
00:10:08,091 --> 00:10:09,735
The one with the two-toned hair.

145
00:10:10,077 --> 00:10:11,022
Kenma!

146
00:10:12,128 --> 00:10:13,968
Seriously dude, what do you have a cold or something?!

147
00:10:13,993 --> 00:10:16,335
I'm fine Inuoka. Just leave me alone.

148
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:20,961
To tell you the truth, I didn't expect them
to come up with a countermeasure that quickly...

149
00:10:20,986 --> 00:10:26,275
But once the word gets around, every team is gonna learn
how to adapt to that Hinata-Kageyama combo we've got.

150
00:10:27,157 --> 00:10:33,250
Don't get me wrong... It's a deadly weapon, but
it's not invincible... The most important thing is...

151
00:10:34,685 --> 00:10:36,104
Is how we use it.

152
00:10:42,827 --> 00:10:43,621
Tanaka!

153
00:10:43,689 --> 00:10:44,248
Got it!

154
00:10:45,647 --> 00:10:50,332
Even flawless read-blocking is no
match for Hinata's breakneck speed!

155
00:11:00,556 --> 00:11:02,734
That was intense!

156
00:11:04,707 --> 00:11:06,454
Yeah!

157
00:11:06,479 --> 00:11:08,171
There's that monster quick-attack.

158
00:11:08,892 --> 00:11:10,291
That move is killer.

159
00:11:10,316 --> 00:11:12,552
It's a game-changer... That's for sure.

160
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,876
Nothing pisses me off worse than a prodigy.

161
00:11:16,561 --> 00:11:18,061
That was a crazy set...

162
00:11:18,179 --> 00:11:22,161
It's like he sent the ball extra hard
just to get Aone out of the way or something.

163
00:11:22,295 --> 00:11:25,258
It had to have been calculated.
The spiker hit it perfectly.

164
00:11:25,411 --> 00:11:28,176
There's no way they planned to
do that. It must have been a fluke!

165
00:11:28,512 --> 00:11:29,408
That kid...

166
00:11:30,132 --> 00:11:31,616
Have you ever seen him before?

167
00:11:31,866 --> 00:11:35,708
No sir... Well at least not from the
most recent middle-school tournament anyway.

168
00:11:36,349 --> 00:11:38,503
Was it a fluke... or not?

169
00:11:39,902 --> 00:11:41,381
It's all you, Tsukishima!

170
00:11:41,406 --> 00:11:41,850
Yep.

171
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:45,782
Hey, your highness... How about a
little something a further from the net...

172
00:11:45,807 --> 00:11:47,869
I'd like to stay clear of their blockers.

173
00:11:49,891 --> 00:11:51,224
Sure, asshole.

174
00:11:51,249 --> 00:11:51,934
Huh?

175
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:53,462
I said sure, okay?!

176
00:11:53,495 --> 00:11:58,764
Look, I know it's not easy for you to take orders from us
peasant commoners, but I'm here to win if you don't mind.

177
00:11:58,789 --> 00:11:59,621
What?!

178
00:12:00,099 --> 00:12:02,512
Guys, knock it off, now's not really the time!

179
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:05,921
Looks like Kageyama finally
busted out that quick attack, huh?

180
00:12:05,946 --> 00:12:08,150
Date Tech must be shaking in their shoes...

181
00:12:08,174 --> 00:12:12,717
And for good reason, you won't find another
technique like that combo attack in the whole world.

182
00:12:13,263 --> 00:12:14,901
It's something else, alright.

183
00:12:17,612 --> 00:12:18,656
Great job, dumbass!

184
00:12:18,681 --> 00:12:22,062
There's still plenty of things they
could stand to improve upon though.

185
00:12:22,876 --> 00:12:23,575
I got you!

186
00:12:25,167 --> 00:12:26,594
Show 'em what you got, man!

187
00:12:31,727 --> 00:12:33,641
You see, that was just a normal set.

188
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:36,819
He must have been really lucky...

189
00:12:36,988 --> 00:12:39,187
Or only number 10 can pull that move off.

190
00:12:39,659 --> 00:12:40,363
Good job!

191
00:12:43,517 --> 00:12:45,884
That was great, Tsukishima, keep it up!

192
00:12:45,909 --> 00:12:47,289
Go, Tsukki!

193
00:12:53,055 --> 00:12:55,480
Yeah! Time to take back what's ours!

194
00:12:55,505 --> 00:12:56,594
Nice, Kamasaki!

195
00:12:56,619 --> 00:12:58,016
Yeah, that was great!

196
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:00,225
I don't think so!

197
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,425
Yeah!

198
00:13:13,228 --> 00:13:15,033
The point gap isn't changing.

199
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:17,376
That's true, but look at the rotation.

200
00:13:17,613 --> 00:13:20,109
Karasuno number 10's back on the front row.

201
00:13:21,155 --> 00:13:22,922
Oh great... him again.

202
00:13:23,089 --> 00:13:27,332
Kageyama hasn't thrown any of those crazy
sets since his number 10 left the front...

203
00:13:27,547 --> 00:13:30,617
And come to think of it, when I
saw him play back in middle school,

204
00:13:31,002 --> 00:13:36,527
I seem to remember him repeatedly leaving Kitagawa's
spiker in the lurch with impossible balls just like that.

205
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,765
I know, and as soon as I saw him set before...

206
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:43,598
I was really afraid he had
gone back to his old bad habits.

207
00:13:43,761 --> 00:13:44,411
But then...

208
00:13:45,798 --> 00:13:47,419
Their number 10 hit it.

209
00:13:50,389 --> 00:13:52,148
Almost like it was planned out.

210
00:13:53,151 --> 00:13:54,071
Futakuchi!

211
00:13:55,813 --> 00:13:56,980
That's how it's done!

212
00:13:57,810 --> 00:13:59,832
Date Tech's pretty tenacious, aren't they?

213
00:13:59,857 --> 00:14:03,063
Yeah, now that Karasuno's number
10's moved up to the front...

214
00:14:03,195 --> 00:14:05,908
Date's best blocker number 7's up there too.

215
00:14:08,594 --> 00:14:12,247
Unstoppable force meets immovable object.

216
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:17,241
They're probably thinking that superhuman
quick attack was just happenstance.

217
00:14:17,978 --> 00:14:19,377
Let's go all in!

218
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:20,385
Right!

219
00:14:24,269 --> 00:14:25,881
It's in! Forward!

220
00:14:26,766 --> 00:14:28,893
He saved it! That's nuts!

221
00:14:28,918 --> 00:14:32,008
But there's no way they can do a quick
from there. Where's he gonna send it?

222
00:14:37,844 --> 00:14:39,007
That's right!

223
00:14:39,081 --> 00:14:39,858
Excellent work, you two!

224
00:14:39,883 --> 00:14:45,044
The kid did it again! The exact same
lightning-fast set but even farther back from the net!

225
00:14:46,421 --> 00:14:49,430
You mean that wasn't... just a fluke?

226
00:14:51,894 --> 00:14:52,887
Let's go!

227
00:14:52,912 --> 00:14:55,323
Oh, wow. Date Tech just called for a time-out.

228
00:14:55,585 --> 00:14:57,763
Dude, is that number 10 even human?

229
00:14:57,862 --> 00:15:00,010
How is he able to hit all those sets?

230
00:15:00,035 --> 00:15:02,349
Technically it's not the spiker who's so amazing.

231
00:15:02,374 --> 00:15:05,500
It's the setter who lines up the
ball for him to hit it so perfectly.

232
00:15:05,525 --> 00:15:06,243
Tch!

233
00:15:06,729 --> 00:15:09,411
It's like watching a pair of fine-tuned robots...

234
00:15:09,506 --> 00:15:11,532
We were mind-blown the first time, too.

235
00:15:12,385 --> 00:15:15,876
If that quick attack is for real,
we won't be able to read-block it.

236
00:15:16,694 --> 00:15:18,565
But if we don't counter somehow...

237
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:21,020
Then that'll be just as bad as throwing in the towel.

238
00:15:21,183 --> 00:15:24,526
If it looks like number 10
might attack, don't mark the set.

239
00:15:24,567 --> 00:15:27,599
Mark him. Stay one step ahead of his jump.

240
00:15:27,878 --> 00:15:31,388
There's still the possibility that
it was just luck, so keep that in mind.

241
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:34,637
Don't concentrate too hard on it,
just stay cool and play it by ear.

242
00:15:34,692 --> 00:15:35,394
Right!

243
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:39,621
I don't think I've ever seen anything like that before.

244
00:15:39,646 --> 00:15:42,114
Do you think he's the only one that can do that move?

245
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:46,824
If that wasn't a fluke, then
they've gotta be some kind of monsters.

246
00:15:47,141 --> 00:15:49,383
True, that quick attack was pretty terrifying...

247
00:15:49,408 --> 00:15:53,237
But if we focus too hard on that, they're
just gonna sneak past us with a normal attack.

248
00:15:53,292 --> 00:15:54,626
It's not that big a deal...

249
00:15:54,843 --> 00:15:57,073
All we really have to do is stop their number 10.

250
00:15:58,095 --> 00:15:59,814
You're way too chill, you know that?

251
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:02,875
Better than having no chill.
That's why you can't get a girlfriend.

252
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,017
What'd you say to me?!

253
00:16:04,906 --> 00:16:06,402
Aone, you know what to do!

254
00:16:09,815 --> 00:16:13,433
But still... if Date can stop
that number 10, they'll be golden.

255
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:14,007
Hm?

256
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:19,126
I mean, he's the only Karasuno guy who seems to be
untouchable when it comes to Date Tech's iron wall.

257
00:16:19,231 --> 00:16:20,442
Yeah, I guess so.

258
00:16:20,996 --> 00:16:23,483
Either way, we know we have our strategy planned out!

259
00:16:23,892 --> 00:16:24,731
Yeah!

260
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:28,734
We've gotta do something about that number 10.

261
00:16:30,456 --> 00:16:31,405
Number 10.

262
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:33,311
Number 10.

263
00:16:35,091 --> 00:16:36,314
Number 10.

264
00:16:38,814 --> 00:16:40,373
That's right, Kageyama...

265
00:16:40,938 --> 00:16:44,513
We're building a reputation with
everybody talking about our little red 10...

266
00:16:44,908 --> 00:16:47,388
So we need Hinata to shine bright out there.

267
00:16:47,595 --> 00:16:49,193
Bring it on!

268
00:16:58,134 --> 00:17:00,288
Jeez, you're slow! We almost missed the game!

269
00:17:00,313 --> 00:17:02,620
Yeah well we actually had some customers for once!

270
00:17:02,645 --> 00:17:03,842
Hurry, hurry!

271
00:17:03,867 --> 00:17:04,526
Um?

272
00:17:05,034 --> 00:17:07,838
Oh, good, we made it! The boys
are still playing round two!

273
00:17:07,863 --> 00:17:09,798
Can't believe they're beating Date Tech!

274
00:17:09,823 --> 00:17:10,677
Bring it here!

275
00:17:10,702 --> 00:17:11,312
Huh?

276
00:17:15,862 --> 00:17:17,436
Damn, that guy is really fast...

277
00:17:17,718 --> 00:17:19,320
Whatever, we at least tried, right?

278
00:17:20,379 --> 00:17:21,918
Huh? What was that?

279
00:17:22,313 --> 00:17:23,318
So quick!

280
00:17:23,576 --> 00:17:25,287
Those two are first-years, aren't they?

281
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,227
Did you guy see how high that little guy can jump?

282
00:17:29,744 --> 00:17:31,730
What are you looking so smug for?

283
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:33,518
Great work, Hinata!

284
00:17:33,589 --> 00:17:34,536
Who's that?

285
00:17:34,697 --> 00:17:37,434
Right! Now do another quick attack just like that!

286
00:17:38,244 --> 00:17:38,778
Make it count!

287
00:17:38,803 --> 00:17:40,889
So Suga's not in the lineup?

288
00:17:41,936 --> 00:17:42,853
Nishinoya!

289
00:17:44,394 --> 00:17:45,158
Go!

290
00:17:45,183 --> 00:17:46,539
Give it here!

291
00:17:46,564 --> 00:17:48,246
Which one of them will it be?

292
00:17:49,894 --> 00:17:50,534
He's jumping!

293
00:17:51,913 --> 00:17:53,526
Ah, o-or not?!

294
00:17:58,568 --> 00:18:00,104
That was a normal one.

295
00:18:00,317 --> 00:18:03,702
So I guess they're setting at
different speeds for different situations.

296
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:07,680
You just think that because you haven't
seen these crazy first-years we got.

297
00:18:08,418 --> 00:18:11,461
They still have a lot of work
to do, but if they keep trying,

298
00:18:11,485 --> 00:18:15,549
I really believe Karasuno High's gonna
have the perfect volleyball team one day.

299
00:18:16,822 --> 00:18:17,808
I get it.

300
00:18:18,946 --> 00:18:20,917
Damn it. Who is that little guy?

301
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,404
Alright, alright!

302
00:18:24,089 --> 00:18:25,468
Don't lose focus!

303
00:18:26,068 --> 00:18:28,686
Remember, you're putting in
some good work out there too...

304
00:18:29,046 --> 00:18:34,055
Their number 10 might have caught you off guard, but
you guys have outdone all kinds of spikers in the past...

305
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:36,344
Including Karasuno's ace!

306
00:18:36,614 --> 00:18:38,387
And this time is no different!

307
00:18:39,659 --> 00:18:40,350
Right!

308
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:43,710
Why do you keep saying "you guys"?
You're part of this team too, you know?!

309
00:18:44,919 --> 00:18:45,855
Futakuchi...

310
00:18:45,946 --> 00:18:49,073
And I always thought you were
just a dumb, bratty underclassman!

311
00:18:49,363 --> 00:18:51,034
Wow, thanks a lot, pal.

312
00:19:05,448 --> 00:19:08,132
Yeaaaahhh!

313
00:19:08,451 --> 00:19:10,159
Nice kill, Aone!

314
00:19:10,741 --> 00:19:13,386
Whoa, did that guy really just jump twice?!

315
00:19:13,411 --> 00:19:17,491
Well, I guess when you're that enormous, even
a little jump can put your hand over the net.

316
00:19:18,398 --> 00:19:22,696
Not only is he tall, he's got long
arms and broad shoulders to his advantage.

317
00:19:23,292 --> 00:19:24,991
But there's even more to him than that.

318
00:19:25,983 --> 00:19:31,631
He's calm enough not to get tunnel vision, plus
he's got the tenacity to stop the ball no matter what.

319
00:19:32,373 --> 00:19:35,946
Those two traits combined, are
what make his blocks so incredible.

320
00:19:37,332 --> 00:19:39,540
Check it out... Now that's a block.

321
00:19:39,565 --> 00:19:42,464
Yeah, that kind of technique
can completely turn things around.

322
00:19:42,489 --> 00:19:46,554
So if Karasuno doesn't score the next
point, then Date Tech will just ride the wave.

323
00:19:46,785 --> 00:19:48,111
We'll stop this too!

324
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:48,939
Yeah!

325
00:19:49,446 --> 00:19:51,497
Let's go! Keep your head in the game!

326
00:19:51,522 --> 00:19:53,060
Come on!

327
00:19:55,571 --> 00:19:57,503
Futakuchi! You got this!

328
00:20:00,983 --> 00:20:01,705
Cover me!

329
00:20:02,237 --> 00:20:02,528
Open!

330
00:20:02,552 --> 00:20:03,413
All you!

331
00:20:03,731 --> 00:20:04,473
Center!

332
00:20:04,498 --> 00:20:05,298
Hinata!

333
00:20:05,323 --> 00:20:06,006
Right!

334
00:20:08,343 --> 00:20:10,074
Yeah!

335
00:20:10,099 --> 00:20:11,430
Nishinoya!

336
00:20:13,297 --> 00:20:14,253
Kageyama!

337
00:20:14,278 --> 00:20:14,879
Here!

338
00:20:15,382 --> 00:20:18,072
Three attackers up front... which one?!

339
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:20,933
Bring it here!

340
00:20:26,964 --> 00:20:28,470
Number 10!

341
00:20:38,072 --> 00:20:39,722
I have to create a path...

342
00:20:40,728 --> 00:20:41,870
for the ace!

343
00:20:46,075 --> 00:20:48,821
And then the view from the other side is totally clear!

344
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:54,867
Yeah...

345
00:20:56,435 --> 00:20:57,790
I remember!

346
00:21:07,546 --> 00:21:10,550
Ooooh yeaaaaah!

347
00:21:12,582 --> 00:21:13,591
Hey, wasn't that...

348
00:21:14,521 --> 00:21:16,667
The same pipe Nekoma did?!

349
00:21:19,907 --> 00:21:20,726
Asahi!

350
00:21:21,239 --> 00:21:23,841
You guys are great... I really mean it.

351
00:21:24,876 --> 00:21:26,405
Thank you so much.

352
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:28,298
Are you kidding me? That was all you, dude!

353
00:21:28,323 --> 00:21:29,857
Good job, Asahi!

354
00:21:31,859 --> 00:21:34,168
Please blaze a trail for Asahi too!

355
00:21:38,041 --> 00:21:39,129
Yes!

356
00:21:40,177 --> 00:21:41,424
Hey, what's the matter?

357
00:21:42,573 --> 00:21:45,699
Well, I... I wasn't the one who scored that last point.

358
00:21:45,793 --> 00:21:47,160
I can't take the glory...

359
00:21:50,963 --> 00:21:52,426
Number 10!

360
00:21:54,648 --> 00:21:55,746
But still, it...

361
00:21:57,071 --> 00:21:58,640
It felt really good.

362
00:22:02,531 --> 00:22:06,044
Like I said, decoy... Your job is just as cool.

363
00:22:09,744 --> 00:22:11,343
The greatest decoy...

364
00:22:12,355 --> 00:22:13,454
I get it.

365
00:22:14,776 --> 00:22:19,020
Alright... at this point, we've showed
'em every weapon we've got in our arsenal.

366
00:22:22,244 --> 00:22:22,894
Now...

367
00:22:23,828 --> 00:22:25,715
The real work begins.

368
00:23:59,013 --> 00:23:59,785
It's changed.

369
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:01,160
What's changed, Aone?

370
00:24:01,185 --> 00:24:02,342
Karasuno.

371
00:24:02,418 --> 00:24:03,279
No kidding!

372
00:24:03,366 --> 00:24:06,644
Now that they have that setter and the short
guy, it's hard to figure out where to block-

373
00:24:06,668 --> 00:24:08,734
The manager's girly hairstyle.

374
00:24:08,759 --> 00:24:09,571
Oh, that?

375
00:24:09,854 --> 00:24:12,112
Our next Haikyu!! "Back protection".
