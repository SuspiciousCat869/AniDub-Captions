1
00:00:21,013 --> 00:00:24,018
You're not fast enough! Can't you jump any higher?!

2
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,370
More.. More.. More!

3
00:00:34,855 --> 00:00:37,808
Why? Why didn't you jump?

4
00:00:38,955 --> 00:00:42,784
'Cause we've had enough of your
crap... Mr. "king of the court."

5
00:00:43,848 --> 00:00:44,462
Gah!

6
00:00:52,173 --> 00:00:52,765
Tch!

7
00:00:56,843 --> 00:00:58,206
Good morning, everybody.

8
00:00:58,361 --> 00:00:59,182
Hello, there.

9
00:00:59,207 --> 00:01:01,094
Hey look! It's that pretty girl!

10
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:01,325
You're looking as beautiful as ever, Kiyoko!

11
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:02,927
So do you think she's the team manager or something?

12
00:01:02,952 --> 00:01:03,698
Ah yeah, ignoring me!

13
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:06,586
Alright, let's get started.

14
00:01:06,611 --> 00:01:07,016
Huh?

15
00:01:07,595 --> 00:01:10,207
I'll play on Tsukishima's team to make it three-on-three.

16
00:01:10,232 --> 00:01:12,001
Huh?! Is that fair though?!

17
00:01:13,059 --> 00:01:16,441
Don't worry, of course it is. Tanaka's
got a lot more attack power than me.

18
00:01:17,024 --> 00:01:18,722
I won't go easy on you though.

19
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:26,300
Well, ahem... the buzzcut or the shorty,
who to crush... I mean, challenge first?

20
00:01:27,458 --> 00:01:31,873
So hard to choose... But I do know
I'd like to save his highness for last.

21
00:01:31,898 --> 00:01:35,725
Uh... Tsukki? They can hear you... be careful.

22
00:01:36,007 --> 00:01:41,548
I know, genius, I want them to hear me... I
can't wait to watch the king fall apart out there.

23
00:01:41,589 --> 00:01:44,735
Well now... you've got quite
a personality there, don't you?

24
00:01:44,963 --> 00:01:50,366
It'll have to be a pretty great show to top watching
him get abandoned by all of his loyal subjects last year.

25
00:01:50,529 --> 00:01:51,672
Hm?

26
00:01:51,697 --> 00:01:52,823
Well, well!

27
00:01:53,399 --> 00:02:00,757
Didja hear that, you guys? They're talking trash
now... That jerk had better.. Just.. Stepppp oooooff!

28
00:02:03,852 --> 00:02:05,167
Or he's dead meat.

29
00:02:05,199 --> 00:02:06,516
Blegh!

30
00:03:41,847 --> 00:03:44,723
He just got it right past that giant first-year guy!

31
00:03:44,748 --> 00:03:46,360
He's even stronger than usual!

32
00:03:46,385 --> 00:03:48,791
Yyyeaaaaahhhh!

33
00:03:49,553 --> 00:03:50,323
Put your shirt on!

34
00:03:50,348 --> 00:03:51,005
Yeah, calm down!

35
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,443
Nobody wants to see that.

36
00:03:52,468 --> 00:03:55,223
This is what happens when you get Tanaka too worked up.

37
00:03:55,464 --> 00:03:55,988
Tch!

38
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:58,134
Heh, so little...

39
00:03:58,159 --> 00:03:58,713
Front!

40
00:03:58,873 --> 00:03:59,554
Got it!

41
00:04:00,068 --> 00:04:01,659
Hey, I can do that too!

42
00:04:02,088 --> 00:04:02,853
Hinata!

43
00:04:03,379 --> 00:04:06,886
That's my set! This'll be my very
first spike in a high school game!

44
00:04:09,268 --> 00:04:09,975
Hm?

45
00:04:11,636 --> 00:04:12,742
I'm gonna score!

46
00:04:18,171 --> 00:04:24,550
There's another wall in my way... a big.. Big wall.

47
00:04:25,204 --> 00:04:28,745
You took me by surprise before...
you have a really nice jump there...

48
00:04:28,928 --> 00:04:34,697
Now if only you were about a foot taller, you'd be
a real superstar. Better start taking your vitamins.

49
00:04:35,367 --> 00:04:36,691
He's only one guy!

50
00:04:37,422 --> 00:04:38,924
Whatever! One more!

51
00:04:39,576 --> 00:04:40,966
I got this one for sure!

52
00:04:43,397 --> 00:04:44,328
Blocked again.

53
00:04:44,995 --> 00:04:46,454
How many times is that?

54
00:04:46,843 --> 00:04:48,171
Tanaka's getting a lot through, though.

55
00:04:48,196 --> 00:04:48,544
Nice one, Tsukki!

56
00:04:48,569 --> 00:04:50,013
Nice block, Tsukishima!

57
00:04:50,038 --> 00:04:50,990
Ah, man.

58
00:04:52,114 --> 00:04:52,844
Thanks. Damn...

59
00:04:52,947 --> 00:04:54,312
He's better than I thought.

60
00:04:55,244 --> 00:04:58,375
You better snap out of it, buddy, or
you're going to keep getting blocked.

61
00:04:58,438 --> 00:05:02,912
Why not give him one of your royal sets...
the kind that wipes out your opponents...

62
00:05:03,082 --> 00:05:05,462
And your teammates at the same time!

63
00:05:05,891 --> 00:05:07,408
Shut your mouth.

64
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,656
Your serve, Tadashi!

65
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:11,363
Agh!

66
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:13,571
Tch!

67
00:05:13,596 --> 00:05:15,937
Uh... Oops... sorry, Tsukki.

68
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,394
Shake it off!

69
00:05:19,395 --> 00:05:21,198
We don't need quick attacks.

70
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:23,566
Time to win.

71
00:05:24,993 --> 00:05:27,333
Alright you got this! Do it!

72
00:05:27,863 --> 00:05:31,177
I remember Kageyama's jump serve, it was pretty amazing.

73
00:05:31,743 --> 00:05:33,758
I can score all the points we need!

74
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:34,770
Ha!

75
00:05:38,238 --> 00:05:38,750
Tadashi!

76
00:05:38,775 --> 00:05:39,607
Leave it to me!

77
00:05:42,004 --> 00:05:42,522
Damn.

78
00:05:42,547 --> 00:05:43,645
Nice toss, Tsukki!

79
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:43,788
You're doing great.

80
00:05:43,813 --> 00:05:46,169
Steady receives like that are Daichi's specialty.

81
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:47,990
They've got mad defense.

82
00:05:48,714 --> 00:05:50,507
Did you think I would be a weak spot?

83
00:05:51,764 --> 00:05:57,850
I may not have as much raw talent as you, but I've
been training on receives for a lot longer than you have.

84
00:05:59,053 --> 00:06:00,999
You won't break through that easily.

85
00:06:01,176 --> 00:06:03,374
Wow, he sounds cool.

86
00:06:03,526 --> 00:06:04,542
Your grace!

87
00:06:05,546 --> 00:06:07,527
Shouldn't you be taking this seriously?

88
00:06:07,552 --> 00:06:12,906
Dude, what's the matter with you?! Why do you keep
picking on the guy?! Chill out with the freakin' nickname!

89
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:17,732
What for? Do you even know why everybody
started calling him the king of the court?

90
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:20,479
I thought his enemies called him that...

91
00:06:20,926 --> 00:06:24,667
Because he's really good player...
and well everybody was so afraid of him.

92
00:06:25,557 --> 00:06:28,144
That's a commonly misunderstanding,
but it's just not true.

93
00:06:28,169 --> 00:06:28,590
Huh?

94
00:06:29,001 --> 00:06:32,841
Well, if the rumors are to be believed,
then his nickname king of the court...

95
00:06:32,866 --> 00:06:35,900
was given to him by the other players of Kitagawa first...

96
00:06:35,925 --> 00:06:40,062
Yeah, that's right, by his
own teammates... the truth is...

97
00:06:40,434 --> 00:06:43,877
They were not paying him a
compliment, but calling him a tyrant.

98
00:06:44,555 --> 00:06:49,231
I've been hearing about it for a long time...
but now that I've seen him play, I'm convinced...

99
00:06:49,349 --> 00:06:53,635
He got benched at the finals because he
was a domineering, power-tripping dictator.

100
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:54,183
Hm?

101
00:06:54,693 --> 00:07:00,433
Kita go! Kita go! Kita go! Kita go!

102
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:04,170
Alright!

103
00:07:04,544 --> 00:07:05,972
They block so high!

104
00:07:06,643 --> 00:07:09,141
I'll have to use a faster attack to shake them off.

105
00:07:09,494 --> 00:07:10,509
Something they won't be able to get to in time.

106
00:07:10,534 --> 00:07:11,462
Hey, it's okay.

107
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:12,226
I guess.

108
00:07:12,251 --> 00:07:13,083
Move faster!

109
00:07:14,147 --> 00:07:14,626
Tch!

110
00:07:14,923 --> 00:07:15,953
Our serve!

111
00:07:17,235 --> 00:07:17,924
Go right!

112
00:07:20,912 --> 00:07:21,553
Nice!

113
00:07:21,578 --> 00:07:26,588
Cut it out! Can't you set it like a normal
person? What's the point if we can't hit it?!

114
00:07:26,768 --> 00:07:27,489
One more to go, you guys!

115
00:07:27,521 --> 00:07:30,720
If I can't shake their blockers, we'll never win!

116
00:07:32,046 --> 00:07:36,321
Is this the end? Is this how we're gonna lose?

117
00:07:36,838 --> 00:07:39,546
No! I have to go to nationals!

118
00:07:40,339 --> 00:07:45,092
If your sorry asses ever expect to win anything,
you'd better learn to adapt to the way I set!

119
00:07:47,441 --> 00:07:48,017
Huh?

120
00:07:52,616 --> 00:07:53,896
End of the first set.

121
00:07:54,594 --> 00:07:57,860
Set point for the opponent. I set the ball up.

122
00:08:03,121 --> 00:08:04,804
But no one was there to hit it.

123
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:08,085
We had messed up several combinations that day...

124
00:08:09,198 --> 00:08:11,178
But that was not a mistake.

125
00:08:12,819 --> 00:08:14,021
It was a rebellion.

126
00:08:14,874 --> 00:08:18,469
They wanted to make it absolutely
clear that they were done with me.

127
00:08:20,336 --> 00:08:21,165
Kageyama.

128
00:08:21,212 --> 00:08:22,142
Huh?

129
00:08:22,642 --> 00:08:24,802
It's time for you to go back to the bench.

130
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:32,810
That's why you won't try a quick attack.
You're still shaken up over what happened that day.

131
00:08:35,192 --> 00:08:37,499
You know what, I've had enough of your smarmy ass-.

132
00:08:37,524 --> 00:08:38,065
Tanaka.

133
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:38,578
Huh?

134
00:08:42,338 --> 00:08:44,895
Well, why bother setting if
there's no one there to spike it?

135
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:45,513
You're right.

136
00:08:45,537 --> 00:08:46,070
Hm?

137
00:08:49,719 --> 00:08:52,044
The thought of nobody being there to back me up...

138
00:08:53,635 --> 00:08:55,016
It terrifies me, alright?

139
00:08:57,541 --> 00:08:59,942
Yeah, but that was back in middle school.

140
00:09:02,597 --> 00:09:06,091
Your sets are gonna reach me... no question about it.

141
00:09:08,204 --> 00:09:11,471
After that.. The only problem is
how to get it past this jerkhole!

142
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:17,596
You need to kick Tsukishima's ass, join
the volleyball club and become the setter,

143
00:09:17,621 --> 00:09:22,225
just like we planned! Then you have to
send the ball to me! It's not that complicated!

144
00:09:24,453 --> 00:09:29,385
Oh shut up... that over-the-top annoying
little attitude of yours... is disgusting.

145
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:30,896
Hm?

146
00:09:31,619 --> 00:09:37,259
And enthusiasm won't make you any taller. If
you think trying hard is all it takes to succeed...

147
00:09:37,578 --> 00:09:39,023
You're sorely mistaken.

148
00:09:40,932 --> 00:09:41,616
I got this, to you!

149
00:09:41,641 --> 00:09:42,354
Tanaka!

150
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:43,646
Give it to me now!

151
00:09:43,671 --> 00:09:44,544
Give it back, give it back, give it back!

152
00:09:44,947 --> 00:09:45,819
Who do I send it to?

153
00:09:45,844 --> 00:09:46,505
Over here! I'm open!

154
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:48,732
I don't know that Hinata can beat this guy.

155
00:09:49,116 --> 00:09:49,560
Tanaka!

156
00:09:49,585 --> 00:09:50,505
Kageyama!

157
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:56,081
No one... was there.

158
00:09:58,134 --> 00:09:59,156
I'm here!

159
00:10:04,057 --> 00:10:04,766
Gah!

160
00:10:05,014 --> 00:10:05,777
Arglgh!

161
00:10:07,761 --> 00:10:11,843
That was close... Almost jumped
at nothing... But it's out.

162
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:13,058
What the hell was that for?!

163
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:14,712
The ball came right towards me!

164
00:10:15,507 --> 00:10:20,153
I don't care about what happened in middle
school! I'm grateful for any set that comes my way!

165
00:10:20,178 --> 00:10:26,911
I just want the ball! I'll jump
anywhere! I'll hit any ball! Believe me!

166
00:10:28,844 --> 00:10:31,249
Give me a set... And I'll hit it!

167
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:52,743
Kageyama planned to send that to Tanaka, I know it.

168
00:10:53,699 --> 00:10:58,693
But when he picked up on Hinata's voice and
movement, he tossed to him with perfect accuracy.

169
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:02,910
He might have a sharp tongue and a bad attitude...

170
00:11:04,053 --> 00:11:06,042
But he really is something else.

171
00:11:06,401 --> 00:11:09,109
You guys can do quick attacks and you didn't tell me?!

172
00:11:09,738 --> 00:11:10,540
What's that?

173
00:11:10,565 --> 00:11:12,583
That crazy-fast attack you just did!

174
00:11:12,608 --> 00:11:17,780
Uh? Uh-uh... no... the only sets
I've ever hit were way up in the air.

175
00:11:17,805 --> 00:11:19,604
You literally just did it!

176
00:11:19,726 --> 00:11:25,317
Look, remember in middle school when that rookie setter
messed up that set and you hit it anyway? Like that!

177
00:11:25,342 --> 00:11:28,010
Huh? But I don't even remember how I did it.

178
00:11:29,608 --> 00:11:33,189
Whatever, I'll still hit any set
that comes at me! You just wait and see!

179
00:11:34,857 --> 00:11:37,753
You've never done combos before,
so that's impossible for you.

180
00:11:39,122 --> 00:11:42,652
Impossible?! Does he even hear himself right now?!

181
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,447
Don't be ridiculous! You don't
get to act like a wimp! Just stop it!

182
00:11:47,754 --> 00:11:48,042
Ugh.

183
00:11:48,067 --> 00:11:48,447
Uh...

184
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:52,950
Not very regal of you, sire.

185
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,309
You're gonna pay for that I promise you!

186
00:11:55,693 --> 00:11:58,533
Look at that... getting all bent out of shape again.

187
00:11:58,807 --> 00:12:02,100
You can't just bulldoze your way
through everything. You know that, right?

188
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:05,341
Not everyone's a good fit for every job, you know.

189
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:08,480
I mean, you're clearly not cut out to be a spiker.

190
00:12:11,754 --> 00:12:13,953
You're right. In middle school...

191
00:12:14,456 --> 00:12:18,356
Even now... no matter how much
I jump, I always get blocked.

192
00:12:19,685 --> 00:12:21,558
Height is important for volleyball...

193
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:25,879
You can't always just jump real high
to make up for being short like me.

194
00:12:27,743 --> 00:12:28,510
But still...

195
00:12:29,813 --> 00:12:32,187
That never stopped me from wanting to be a spiker.

196
00:12:34,161 --> 00:12:36,305
I don't care whether I'm cut out for it or not.

197
00:12:38,111 --> 00:12:41,086
I'll do the best I can with what I've got and I'll win!

198
00:12:41,915 --> 00:12:44,082
I'm on this court and I'm not going anywhere.

199
00:12:53,149 --> 00:12:53,714
No.

200
00:12:54,694 --> 00:12:56,047
I'm not leaving...

201
00:12:57,002 --> 00:12:59,448
I want to stay on the court the longest!

202
00:13:03,836 --> 00:13:08,781
Have you even listened to a word I've
said? It doesn't really work that way, shorty.

203
00:13:08,814 --> 00:13:13,249
You can't substitute spirit for height.
Unless you want to be a libero, that is.

204
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:16,212
Give a set and I'll hit it!

205
00:13:21,684 --> 00:13:23,950
I open up the wall and block the spiker.

206
00:13:27,593 --> 00:13:29,069
That's the setter's job!

207
00:13:36,515 --> 00:13:38,196
Whoa, what gives, Kageyama?!

208
00:13:38,354 --> 00:13:38,848
Gah, let go! You're hurting me!

209
00:13:38,872 --> 00:13:40,534
Hey man, could you chill?!

210
00:13:41,106 --> 00:13:42,433
What the-gah!

211
00:13:42,595 --> 00:13:45,587
Listen up. If you can't make the shot...

212
00:13:46,086 --> 00:13:50,132
Then I want you to go around them and hit my
sets with all the power and agility you've got.

213
00:13:50,157 --> 00:13:52,444
Huh?! That's how you explain quick attacks?!

214
00:13:52,469 --> 00:13:52,948
Got it.

215
00:13:52,972 --> 00:13:54,738
There is no way you got that!

216
00:13:54,763 --> 00:13:56,692
We have to at least give it a try!

217
00:13:56,733 --> 00:14:00,338
What's with you? Not 2 minutes ago
you were nothin' but doom and gloom.

218
00:14:00,652 --> 00:14:01,456
I was not.

219
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:02,595
You lie!

220
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:03,159
Okay...

221
00:14:03,183 --> 00:14:04,123
Serve it!

222
00:14:04,867 --> 00:14:06,194
Ready to go!

223
00:14:06,702 --> 00:14:10,032
He should have the speed and reflexes to hit a quick set.

224
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:15,165
Bring it on, Kageyama! Show me what you've got!

225
00:14:15,362 --> 00:14:16,458
Go, Tsukki!

226
00:14:16,482 --> 00:14:19,477
We haven't established any signals, so for now...

227
00:14:20,303 --> 00:14:22,347
Got it, so he's gonna set it that way.

228
00:14:24,878 --> 00:14:25,041
Nice!

229
00:14:25,066 --> 00:14:27,105
That's weaker than Mrs. Yoshida's serve...

230
00:14:27,493 --> 00:14:30,618
Once it comes my way, I'll just-ggh!

231
00:14:31,179 --> 00:14:31,866
Ah...

232
00:14:33,124 --> 00:14:35,546
Oh. Faster than I thought.

233
00:14:35,571 --> 00:14:37,576
How'd you miss that! You have to-

234
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:41,542
Nice ball, your highness!

235
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:44,371
Nothing ever works out on the first try!

236
00:14:44,396 --> 00:14:46,443
Hey, that's what losers say.

237
00:14:47,362 --> 00:14:48,835
Hwph! Gaaah!

238
00:14:49,238 --> 00:14:51,528
Gwah! I touched it that ti-oof!

239
00:14:53,395 --> 00:14:54,928
You look like a fish!

240
00:14:56,643 --> 00:14:58,916
I can't guess your timing at all.

241
00:14:59,142 --> 00:15:02,987
You have lightning-fast reflexes! You
just need to give it more "pow!" More "oomph!"

242
00:15:03,012 --> 00:15:05,165
Is it oomph or pow?! Make up your mind!

243
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:07,347
Don't get caught up in the terminology!

244
00:15:07,593 --> 00:15:08,406
Kageyama.

245
00:15:08,431 --> 00:15:08,986
Hm?

246
00:15:09,775 --> 00:15:12,621
You need to make sure you don't let history repeat itself.

247
00:15:13,376 --> 00:15:15,159
Uhh... what I mean is, uh...

248
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:20,862
He's got super fast reflexes and uh... He
can jump! He can learn how to quick attack!

249
00:15:21,318 --> 00:15:23,258
That's not really what I'm getting at though...

250
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,211
I think I know how you guys can be more effective.

251
00:15:26,236 --> 00:15:26,855
Hmmm?

252
00:15:27,669 --> 00:15:30,165
Hinata doesn't really know what he's doing out there.

253
00:15:30,577 --> 00:15:31,478
That's kinda harsh...

254
00:15:31,503 --> 00:15:35,895
He doesn't have technique or experience like a lot
of the people you competed against in middle school.

255
00:15:36,712 --> 00:15:38,098
But he's a rare asset.

256
00:15:38,123 --> 00:15:41,611
Huh?! Really?! Aww come on, I'm
not like a genius or anything...

257
00:15:41,636 --> 00:15:42,738
Who said that?

258
00:15:43,374 --> 00:15:46,477
If I had your skill... I mean, think about it...

259
00:15:46,502 --> 00:15:51,166
Maybe you should try adapting to more of Hinata's
characteristics instead of the other way around,

260
00:15:51,191 --> 00:15:53,098
don't you see what I'm saying? Then...

261
00:15:53,138 --> 00:15:54,575
Take it easy, Suga!

262
00:15:54,646 --> 00:15:57,488
It's up to you to use his talents more effectively!

263
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:05,065
I'm a setter like you, so I was honestly
pretty freaked out when I saw you play last year.

264
00:16:05,972 --> 00:16:08,820
You've got incredible talent and control over the ball...

265
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:15,556
But most of all, you're good at analyzing the opponent's
blocking moves and you make decisions on the fly.

266
00:16:16,112 --> 00:16:18,688
I've got... none of those things.

267
00:16:19,117 --> 00:16:20,532
Don't you say crap like that-

268
00:16:20,557 --> 00:16:22,612
Hold on... just let him talk, okay?

269
00:16:24,388 --> 00:16:27,585
You're good at what you do and
have almost too much determination...

270
00:16:28,232 --> 00:16:31,930
But your ability to assess your
surroundings is your most important skill.

271
00:16:32,314 --> 00:16:34,664
So pay closer attention to your allies!

272
00:16:34,689 --> 00:16:35,062
Hm?

273
00:16:35,194 --> 00:16:35,562
Hup!

274
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:42,856
Use his talents more effectively?!

275
00:16:43,412 --> 00:16:45,120
The ball came right towards me!

276
00:16:47,513 --> 00:16:47,943
Hm?

277
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:52,922
Listen...

278
00:16:52,947 --> 00:16:54,074
Uh! Uh-huh?!

279
00:16:54,312 --> 00:16:56,540
I'm jealous of your crazy reflexes, alright?

280
00:16:56,565 --> 00:16:57,294
Huh?!

281
00:16:57,462 --> 00:17:00,648
That's right... That's why you
piss me off. It's such a waste!

282
00:17:00,673 --> 00:17:01,361
Huh?!

283
00:17:01,386 --> 00:17:02,220
That said!

284
00:17:02,245 --> 00:17:05,416
All I can do now is use your talent to the fullest!

285
00:17:06,765 --> 00:17:07,544
What the?

286
00:17:09,225 --> 00:17:13,558
You're gonna run at full speed... And
you're gonna jump as high as you can.

287
00:17:14,517 --> 00:17:16,055
I'll deliver the ball to you!

288
00:17:17,378 --> 00:17:20,073
What do you mean by... "Deliver the ball"?

289
00:17:20,182 --> 00:17:27,048
All you have to do is jump at Max height and Max speed
wherever there's an opening.. And swing at full power.

290
00:17:27,273 --> 00:17:31,131
Forget adjusting to the ball...
you don't even need to see the ball.

291
00:17:31,285 --> 00:17:33,829
Huh?! How can I hit if I don't even see it?!

292
00:17:33,854 --> 00:17:34,519
I don't know!

293
00:17:34,544 --> 00:17:35,123
What?!

294
00:17:35,234 --> 00:17:37,403
Just... try, okay?

295
00:17:40,564 --> 00:17:41,233
Alright.

296
00:17:41,972 --> 00:17:47,637
What are those two plotting over there? I mean,
no one wants to deal his majesty's selfish ways.

297
00:17:47,662 --> 00:17:48,487
Exactly.

298
00:17:49,023 --> 00:17:50,289
Hope they've got a plan...

299
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:54,578
Hinata's not gonna be able to adjust
to those tosses without some practice.

300
00:17:55,311 --> 00:17:56,914
Let's go! One point!

301
00:18:04,617 --> 00:18:06,028
He's in the zone.

302
00:18:08,091 --> 00:18:09,134
See now.

303
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:13,361
Where are the blockers? Where's the ball?

304
00:18:13,578 --> 00:18:16,727
Where's the spiker? What's his next move?

305
00:18:17,413 --> 00:18:20,677
Where will he jump, and how high is he going to go?

306
00:18:22,024 --> 00:18:26,262
Now! This position! This angle! This moment!

307
00:18:29,059 --> 00:18:29,822
Yes!

308
00:18:29,886 --> 00:18:34,940
Ah... whoa...

309
00:18:35,069 --> 00:18:36,959
I... I touched the ball!

310
00:18:37,898 --> 00:18:39,467
It wasn't that great...

311
00:18:39,897 --> 00:18:40,549
Guys...

312
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:44,621
He just did that... With his eyes closed.

313
00:18:44,685 --> 00:18:45,483
Huh?!

314
00:18:46,047 --> 00:18:47,827
What?! No way!

315
00:18:48,454 --> 00:18:54,225
From the moment his feet left the floor to the
second he swung his arm, Hinata's eyes were closed.

316
00:18:54,480 --> 00:19:00,566
Kageyama just made a pinpoint toss into Hinata's
hand, but Hinata wasn't even looking at the ball!

317
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:04,768
I don't know how he did it, but his timing was perfect!

318
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:07,869
Huh?

319
00:19:07,894 --> 00:19:13,474
That's awesome! You guys! I dunno what happened,
but I just hit something! Did you see that?! Huh?!

320
00:19:13,499 --> 00:19:16,666
Hey! What'd you do?! Your eyes
weren't really shut, were they?!

321
00:19:16,691 --> 00:19:19,333
Um, well you're the one who
told me not to look at the ball!

322
00:19:19,564 --> 00:19:22,058
If I kept my eyes open, I knew I would look at it.

323
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:24,083
I wasn't telling you to...

324
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,321
But... but it worked, right? What's the big deal?

325
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:31,984
I know it worked... but what kind
of person acts totally on trust?!

326
00:19:32,009 --> 00:19:35,134
I can't help it! Trust is the
only way I know how to do it!

327
00:19:37,747 --> 00:19:40,899
What have you been wasting all
your time on for three years?!

328
00:19:42,487 --> 00:19:44,725
His mobility and jumping power...

329
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:45,360
That was crazy! Nice one, dude!

330
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:48,117
My sets can enhance that!

331
00:19:49,861 --> 00:19:55,037
Tanaka, if we can score with Hinata's spike, then our
marks'll scatter and make it easier for you to strike too.

332
00:19:55,213 --> 00:19:55,484
Yeah!

333
00:19:55,509 --> 00:19:56,247
Right on!

334
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:59,535
Look, I know we don't have any
special trust built up or anything...

335
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,140
Hm?

336
00:20:01,285 --> 00:20:05,622
But I'll deliver the next ball to you. So jump, okay?

337
00:20:09,999 --> 00:20:10,550
Here!

338
00:20:12,518 --> 00:20:13,192
Sorry.

339
00:20:13,724 --> 00:20:16,548
Hmm... I guess that first time was a fluke.

340
00:20:16,655 --> 00:20:19,615
Yeah, but I can tell their
precision's already starting to improve.

341
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,020
Uh? You really think so?

342
00:20:21,059 --> 00:20:21,591
Mm-hm.

343
00:20:21,874 --> 00:20:23,403
That was a nice one, Hinata.

344
00:20:23,428 --> 00:20:25,553
Man... Too far away from the net that time.

345
00:20:26,103 --> 00:20:26,551
That hurt...

346
00:20:26,576 --> 00:20:28,147
This really is tough...

347
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:33,681
Keeping up with everything that happens
on the court is exhausting... but...

348
00:20:34,715 --> 00:20:35,655
It's fun!

349
00:20:35,851 --> 00:20:40,118
What're you smiling about?! This is the
second time I've been smacked in the face!

350
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:45,938
I'm not buying it... that had to be a one-time
thing... why are they even still trying it?

351
00:20:46,533 --> 00:20:52,168
Well guess what... Hinata's probably gonna jump
without looking at the ball about a million more times.

352
00:20:52,278 --> 00:20:52,883
I'm starting to think you do this on purpose.

353
00:20:52,908 --> 00:20:54,572
You're right though, it is pretty unbelievable...

354
00:20:54,597 --> 00:20:55,469
You do know we have to win, right?

355
00:20:55,494 --> 00:20:58,158
It's difficult to trust another person 100%.

356
00:20:59,518 --> 00:21:01,451
Especially your sworn enemy.

357
00:21:02,767 --> 00:21:06,558
Aw maaaan, it's not working... but...

358
00:21:07,681 --> 00:21:09,675
I definitely felt it that one time...

359
00:21:10,428 --> 00:21:12,836
I felt the heaviness of the core of the ball.

360
00:21:13,956 --> 00:21:15,958
I really like that feeling.

361
00:21:17,946 --> 00:21:19,458
Just one more try.

362
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:25,772
More carefully this time. A set that gives
the spiker the chance to use maximum force.

363
00:21:27,572 --> 00:21:29,035
Got it! Here!

364
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:30,035
Nice receive!

365
00:21:30,292 --> 00:21:35,266
Looks like he gave it to short-stack by mistake...
Let's just keep our eyes on the skinhead fella.

366
00:21:35,891 --> 00:21:36,849
Hey Tadashi!

367
00:21:36,933 --> 00:21:37,325
Oh!

368
00:21:39,005 --> 00:21:39,765
The wall!

369
00:21:40,595 --> 00:21:43,030
Listen up... if you can't make the shot...

370
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:44,786
Go around!

371
00:21:48,651 --> 00:21:50,310
I'm shorter than the tall players.

372
00:21:51,328 --> 00:21:54,741
So I need that extra inch, that extra second...

373
00:21:56,351 --> 00:21:57,570
To reach the peak!

374
00:21:58,453 --> 00:22:00,358
For this one single moment in time...

375
00:22:01,293 --> 00:22:02,855
I'm at the highest point!

376
00:22:05,357 --> 00:22:08,683
There's a big, tall wall in front of me, blocking my way.

377
00:22:09,752 --> 00:22:14,038
I wonder what's waiting on the other
side? What's the view like over there?

378
00:22:14,893 --> 00:22:17,241
It's something I'll never be able to see on my own.

379
00:22:17,945 --> 00:22:18,905
It's the view...

380
00:22:23,436 --> 00:22:24,559
from the summit.

381
00:22:40,523 --> 00:22:41,512
Yes!

382
00:24:13,718 --> 00:24:17,537
You can't just spike with your eyes closed! Who are you?!

383
00:24:17,562 --> 00:24:18,726
I don't believe this.

384
00:24:18,751 --> 00:24:20,083
This is getting kinda crazy, huh?

385
00:24:20,108 --> 00:24:21,776
Send me the next one too, would ya?

386
00:24:22,929 --> 00:24:23,984
Calm down!

387
00:24:24,163 --> 00:24:26,618
Aww... anyway, next Haikyu:

388
00:24:26,686 --> 00:24:28,023
"The first time jitters."
