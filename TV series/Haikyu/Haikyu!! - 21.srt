1
00:00:06,865 --> 00:00:09,222
Hey, Karasuno's swapping setters.

2
00:00:21,128 --> 00:00:22,043
Don't feel bad...

3
00:00:22,237 --> 00:00:24,051
We just need to change up the rhythm.

4
00:00:24,831 --> 00:00:25,899
I'm sorry.

5
00:00:28,356 --> 00:00:29,698
I am worried about him.

6
00:00:32,395 --> 00:00:35,550
But we can't have both of them losing their grip at once.

7
00:00:36,261 --> 00:00:39,044
I already promised you that I'd be the one to beat you!

8
00:00:40,417 --> 00:00:41,605
Hey, Hinata! He's gonna get ma...

9
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:43,932
Don't you dare lose to those guys first!

10
00:00:48,875 --> 00:00:50,796
Well, I haven't lost yet, have I?

11
00:00:51,255 --> 00:00:52,542
The game is still on.

12
00:00:54,551 --> 00:00:56,577
He is gonna kill you!

13
00:00:57,441 --> 00:00:59,401
I guess there was no need to panic.

14
00:01:00,909 --> 00:01:03,351
Kageyama... I want you to stay ready.

15
00:01:03,593 --> 00:01:05,403
Just take a few minutes to cool off.

16
00:01:05,903 --> 00:01:08,117
Maybe you'll learn something from your upperclassman.

17
00:02:40,208 --> 00:02:40,839
You!

18
00:02:41,438 --> 00:02:42,012
You!

19
00:02:42,585 --> 00:02:43,037
You!

20
00:02:43,865 --> 00:02:44,596
You!

21
00:02:44,825 --> 00:02:45,512
And you!

22
00:02:45,537 --> 00:02:46,432
Aw yeah!

23
00:02:47,992 --> 00:02:50,836
I hope you're ready! We are getting this point!

24
00:02:53,778 --> 00:02:54,898
Yeah!

25
00:02:59,658 --> 00:03:00,276
What?

26
00:03:01,196 --> 00:03:03,724
Kageyama, you're making that ugly face again.

27
00:03:03,749 --> 00:03:05,672
It's my face, asshole!

28
00:03:05,865 --> 00:03:09,249
You just look so tense... And you've been so quiet.

29
00:03:10,194 --> 00:03:13,275
I'm sure you're just really deep
in thought about something, right?

30
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:16,116
But you're hard to read when you go all silent like that.

31
00:03:18,173 --> 00:03:20,499
So you're saying I'm not talking to the team?

32
00:03:20,595 --> 00:03:23,878
Yup, you've been quieter in this
game than in any game we've ever played.

33
00:03:24,338 --> 00:03:25,129
It's weird!

34
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:30,150
Damn, have I gotten so bad that
this idiot gets to lecture me?

35
00:03:30,518 --> 00:03:33,686
Hey... That setter Karasuno just put in... Number 2...?

36
00:03:34,586 --> 00:03:36,094
Looks like he's a third-year!

37
00:03:36,806 --> 00:03:37,618
What?!

38
00:03:37,729 --> 00:03:41,304
I wonder why they would replace a guy like
that with a first-year in the starting lineup?!

39
00:03:41,704 --> 00:03:44,307
Hey, Daichi! Why are you being so quiet today?

40
00:03:44,332 --> 00:03:44,779
Huh?

41
00:03:45,226 --> 00:03:47,398
We can't have our captain losin' his cool!

42
00:03:47,438 --> 00:03:48,645
Oh, uh... sorry.

43
00:03:48,924 --> 00:03:50,635
Nobody lectures Daichi!

44
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:51,519
'Cept for him.

45
00:03:51,544 --> 00:03:52,579
Tsukishima, c'mere.

46
00:03:55,171 --> 00:03:58,381
I'm not sure what Mr. Optimism is actually good at...

47
00:04:00,165 --> 00:04:05,026
But from his warmup, it's clear that he's
meticulous and serious about what he does.

48
00:04:05,785 --> 00:04:06,579
Look, Iwa...

49
00:04:07,078 --> 00:04:10,985
Number 2's got a low block, so I want
you to aim for a straight-down where he is.

50
00:04:11,033 --> 00:04:11,600
Sure.

51
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:17,507
Nice receive!

52
00:04:18,602 --> 00:04:19,126
Tanaka!

53
00:04:19,151 --> 00:04:19,866
Gotcha!

54
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:22,219
Iwa!

55
00:04:22,866 --> 00:04:25,089
Okay... Straight down at the low blocker!

56
00:04:28,044 --> 00:04:28,840
Iwa!

57
00:04:34,592 --> 00:04:38,142
Rejected! Guess they must've
seen that straight-down coming.

58
00:04:38,167 --> 00:04:40,209
Yeah! That was a really nifty trick!

59
00:04:40,597 --> 00:04:44,193
Right before Seijoh spiked it,
they swapped their blocker positions.

60
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:48,306
That was great, Tsukishima! You pulled one over on them!

61
00:04:48,484 --> 00:04:50,110
That.. Wasn't just me...

62
00:04:50,603 --> 00:04:52,450
Y'see, I'm a low blocker...

63
00:04:52,645 --> 00:04:55,485
So whenever we play a tough
team I'm always getting targeted.

64
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:58,172
And I figured they would be no exception.

65
00:04:59,147 --> 00:05:02,304
It comes in pretty handy to have
someone as tall as you next to me!

66
00:05:02,491 --> 00:05:05,015
Um... thanks, I guess...

67
00:05:05,792 --> 00:05:06,591
Yikes.

68
00:05:06,616 --> 00:05:07,761
Sorry about that.

69
00:05:09,502 --> 00:05:10,822
Here we go!

70
00:05:11,517 --> 00:05:12,577
Hinata, c'mere!

71
00:05:13,786 --> 00:05:15,177
All you, Tsukki!

72
00:05:17,813 --> 00:05:18,520
Here!

73
00:05:18,924 --> 00:05:20,057
Nice receive!

74
00:05:20,915 --> 00:05:22,854
Man, they're giving it right back to them!

75
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:24,147
Oh, a quick attack!

76
00:05:25,915 --> 00:05:26,975
And an A-Quick!

77
00:05:32,378 --> 00:05:33,838
Woohoo!

78
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:37,747
Hinata, that was freakin' great!

79
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:40,016
Yeah, well you guessed right, Sugawara!

80
00:05:40,633 --> 00:05:45,394
Next time they're able to neatly send it back to the
setter, they'll probably do a quick attack in the center.

81
00:05:45,934 --> 00:05:49,153
But I want you to move slowly
and delay your jump a little bit.

82
00:05:49,775 --> 00:05:50,517
Y'got that!

83
00:05:51,274 --> 00:05:53,436
It was frustrating to have to watch from the sidelines,

84
00:05:53,461 --> 00:05:57,716
but I think being outside the game allowed
me to assess the situation more calmly.

85
00:05:57,882 --> 00:06:00,076
I was able to see the game with new eyes.

86
00:06:00,163 --> 00:06:02,804
So the time I spent not playing was useful too.

87
00:06:03,386 --> 00:06:05,987
The energy on our side is really amping up now!

88
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:06,899
Yeah...

89
00:06:07,623 --> 00:06:08,871
You're worried, aren't you?

90
00:06:08,896 --> 00:06:09,196
Huh?

91
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,982
Because you benched Kageyama, right.

92
00:06:12,195 --> 00:06:13,557
And he's so prideful...

93
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:16,254
Are you afraid that he'll get
all bent out of shape over it?

94
00:06:18,473 --> 00:06:19,410
He'll be alright.

95
00:06:19,729 --> 00:06:23,282
I think Kageyama's pride is the
main source of his power and talent.

96
00:06:23,442 --> 00:06:28,532
That, and his undying determination to
be a better player, make him exceptional.

97
00:06:28,557 --> 00:06:30,065
Give us one more, Tsukki!

98
00:06:30,285 --> 00:06:31,691
One point to break it!

99
00:06:31,798 --> 00:06:32,775
Yeah!

100
00:06:32,815 --> 00:06:35,159
Okay, what attack are we doing next?

101
00:06:35,858 --> 00:06:40,284
My technical skill's not as good as Kageyama's
is, so I can't always toss perfect sets...

102
00:06:40,348 --> 00:06:43,823
but hand signals might help us
communicate our next move during a game.

103
00:06:49,186 --> 00:06:52,270
When an outsider looks at Suga, they only see one thing.

104
00:06:53,114 --> 00:06:56,349
A poor third-year who got replaced by a first-year.

105
00:06:57,546 --> 00:06:59,303
He didn't use his code words!

106
00:06:59,476 --> 00:07:02,668
Kageyama's out, so it can't be that insane quick attack!

107
00:07:02,782 --> 00:07:03,963
Right, duh!

108
00:07:06,543 --> 00:07:12,575
But what they don't know, is that Suga has spent
enough time on the sidelines to know exactly what to do...

109
00:07:12,837 --> 00:07:15,686
He's just as much of an asset as Kageyama!

110
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:18,569
Gotcha!

111
00:07:19,103 --> 00:07:20,662
When it comes to actual ability,

112
00:07:21,258 --> 00:07:23,159
I pale in comparison to Kageyama,

113
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:26,686
but I've been watching this team a lot longer than he has.

114
00:07:27,821 --> 00:07:29,998
I know I don't have what it takes to beat Seijoh...

115
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:34,303
but my friends are amazing at what they do!

116
00:07:36,515 --> 00:07:38,315
This point will turn the tide!

117
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:39,074
Right!

118
00:07:48,222 --> 00:07:49,375
Good effort, Hinata.

119
00:07:49,659 --> 00:07:50,388
Hey, guys.

120
00:07:51,801 --> 00:07:52,641
Serve's up!

121
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:53,621
One point!

122
00:07:54,116 --> 00:07:55,549
Oh... great.

123
00:07:59,238 --> 00:08:00,666
Oikawa's serve.

124
00:08:01,095 --> 00:08:02,496
Bring it on!

125
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:07,543
Oooooooolé.

126
00:08:07,568 --> 00:08:08,603
Leave it to me! I'll get it!

127
00:08:10,233 --> 00:08:12,080
The old hubby-wife play.

128
00:08:12,134 --> 00:08:14,352
It happens when two receivers get mixed up.

129
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:16,580
Sorry, I should've gone for it myself.

130
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,528
I was too close! It's cool!

131
00:08:20,856 --> 00:08:25,325
Oooooooolé.

132
00:08:25,852 --> 00:08:27,079
Front line!

133
00:08:30,898 --> 00:08:32,440
Set point for Seijoh.

134
00:08:32,933 --> 00:08:36,992
Damn... How many times has Oikawa
scored with that serve of his?!

135
00:08:37,532 --> 00:08:39,784
If there was an ultimate play in volleyball,

136
00:08:39,887 --> 00:08:43,417
it would be scoring all 25 points with nothing but serves.

137
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,774
The opponent never gets a chance to attack.

138
00:08:46,983 --> 00:08:49,138
That's what service aces are all about.

139
00:08:49,552 --> 00:08:51,630
I got it, it's miiine!

140
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:52,996
Okay!

141
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:00,335
Number 10 and Number 5 are after it...

142
00:09:01,191 --> 00:09:03,472
No, it's a back attack!

143
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:07,171
Yeah, nice receive!

144
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:10,247
Hinata, right now, do a direct!

145
00:09:11,044 --> 00:09:12,721
I've never done a direct attack...

146
00:09:13,614 --> 00:09:15,144
What the hell was that?!

147
00:09:15,169 --> 00:09:17,042
I-I'm sorry, okay?!

148
00:09:21,248 --> 00:09:22,015
Hey, guys.

149
00:09:23,634 --> 00:09:25,370
I think I just noticed something...

150
00:09:25,483 --> 00:09:30,551
It kinda looks like Seijoh carries out their quick
attacks a little bit slower than we do... We should...

151
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:32,713
Delay it by just a hair...

152
00:09:34,343 --> 00:09:35,304
and jump!

153
00:09:37,665 --> 00:09:38,634
Get back!

154
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:39,634
No!

155
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:47,829
It's out?!

156
00:09:47,855 --> 00:09:48,788
Son of a...

157
00:09:50,821 --> 00:09:52,478
Switch sides. Let's go!

158
00:09:53,756 --> 00:09:56,151
Come on, Hinata! We'll get it next time.

159
00:09:56,908 --> 00:09:57,628
Okay!

160
00:09:58,088 --> 00:10:01,447
Agh, that was too close! They figured out our timing!

161
00:10:02,276 --> 00:10:05,146
All their players are starting
to look before they leap now...

162
00:10:05,387 --> 00:10:09,698
including the short one, and he
tends to blindly rely on his instincts.

163
00:10:14,931 --> 00:10:15,425
Here.

164
00:10:15,685 --> 00:10:16,191
Here.

165
00:10:16,931 --> 00:10:18,515
We'll go with the current lineup.

166
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:19,613
Sir!

167
00:10:21,026 --> 00:10:25,168
Okay, our biggest obstacle is Oikawa's serve, obviously.

168
00:10:26,286 --> 00:10:28,392
So we're gonna beef up our defense!

169
00:10:29,714 --> 00:10:31,864
Karasuno's attacks are pretty wild.

170
00:10:32,211 --> 00:10:35,710
Just when we got into the right mindset
to handle that crazy quick attack...

171
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:40,293
They decided they would try to throw us
off our game by attacking us like normal.

172
00:10:40,318 --> 00:10:42,426
You're focusing way too much on Number 10.

173
00:10:42,607 --> 00:10:45,811
Iwa! Don't think too hard; You'll run out of brain cells!

174
00:10:47,427 --> 00:10:50,451
During the practice game, we were scrutinizing Kageyama.

175
00:10:51,556 --> 00:10:54,123
I didn't realize they had another solid setter.

176
00:10:54,953 --> 00:10:55,460
Listen.

177
00:10:55,507 --> 00:10:55,980
Yeah?

178
00:10:56,453 --> 00:10:59,707
Uh, Kindaichi... Um I mean... Onion Head.

179
00:11:01,547 --> 00:11:04,215
Number 12's quick attack is a
little bit on the slow side...

180
00:11:04,448 --> 00:11:05,699
I mean, don't you think?

181
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:08,184
You're right, it is!

182
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:12,318
It's like that guy watches the ball
forever before he actually goes in for the hit.

183
00:11:13,859 --> 00:11:16,828
Sugawara's a control tower they're not familiar with...

184
00:11:16,947 --> 00:11:18,993
That oughta throw these guys off.

185
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:21,097
He's different from Kageyama.

186
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:26,029
Yeah... I put him in hoping he'd bring
the other kids back to their senses...

187
00:11:26,855 --> 00:11:28,429
but this works just as well.

188
00:11:29,368 --> 00:11:32,347
We'll have to remember this
little strategy in the future too.

189
00:11:33,002 --> 00:11:33,689
Kageyama.

190
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:34,495
Uh-huh.

191
00:11:34,999 --> 00:11:37,373
Okay, so I understand since we're both setters,

192
00:11:37,398 --> 00:11:40,415
we're kinda supposed to be competing
for the same position or whatever...

193
00:11:41,568 --> 00:11:43,494
But I just want to play volleyball!

194
00:11:43,718 --> 00:11:45,238
Uh, s-same here.

195
00:11:45,889 --> 00:11:49,958
Now that I'm actually standing on the court,
I realize how tall the Aoba-Johsai guys are,

196
00:11:49,983 --> 00:11:52,483
and how that makes me a walking target for their spikes...

197
00:11:52,643 --> 00:11:53,874
It's kinda scary.

198
00:11:54,202 --> 00:11:56,720
But y'know what... I know I'm okay, because...

199
00:11:57,033 --> 00:11:59,072
Now I have you right there behind me.

200
00:12:00,023 --> 00:12:01,227
That's reassuring.

201
00:12:01,727 --> 00:12:03,615
The points we make while I'm on the court...

202
00:12:03,935 --> 00:12:05,857
and the points we make with you on the court...

203
00:12:06,497 --> 00:12:07,970
they're all points for Karasuno.

204
00:12:08,955 --> 00:12:15,405
So I will give it my absolute best... and you give
it your best too... That is how we'll beat Seijoh.

205
00:12:16,689 --> 00:12:17,156
Yeah.

206
00:12:18,162 --> 00:12:19,985
Are you crying or something, Kageyama?

207
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:21,639
No I'm not, butt-wad!

208
00:12:21,852 --> 00:12:24,817
Don't yell at me! I was just
concerned about you, that's all!

209
00:12:24,929 --> 00:12:28,037
Worry about yourself and that
lame direct you just screwed up!

210
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:30,827
Sh-shut up! I've never done it before!

211
00:12:30,974 --> 00:12:34,239
Well there's a whole lot more of those
to come when I get back in the game!

212
00:12:39,097 --> 00:12:39,697
Let's go!

213
00:12:39,804 --> 00:12:41,475
Yeah!

214
00:12:58,905 --> 00:13:02,798
Suga! You don't have to get all
introspective and overthink this.

215
00:13:02,876 --> 00:13:03,904
Uh, I won't.

216
00:13:04,598 --> 00:13:06,381
We'll make a comeback in the second set.

217
00:13:06,632 --> 00:13:08,345
The first step to achieving that...

218
00:13:08,915 --> 00:13:11,207
is breaking Oikawa's serve.

219
00:13:14,408 --> 00:13:16,910
Seijoh's rotation is the same as the first set,

220
00:13:17,736 --> 00:13:19,886
but Karasuno moved theirs up a little bit.

221
00:13:20,115 --> 00:13:22,355
Huh. Wonder why they did that?

222
00:13:26,104 --> 00:13:26,597
Yes!

223
00:13:26,622 --> 00:13:27,208
Alright!

224
00:13:27,233 --> 00:13:27,562
Ha!

225
00:13:27,777 --> 00:13:29,089
Nice, Tsukishima!

226
00:13:29,356 --> 00:13:30,250
Uh, thanks.

227
00:13:30,817 --> 00:13:32,140
Do that again, okay?

228
00:13:32,346 --> 00:13:35,957
He's really nice... He always
compliments me when I do good, too!

229
00:13:36,038 --> 00:13:36,908
That's great...

230
00:13:37,048 --> 00:13:40,352
It is, but Sugawara doesn't do that
just for the sake of being friendly...

231
00:13:40,942 --> 00:13:45,023
I think he talks to all the spikers so he can get
a feel for their emotional state during the game.

232
00:13:45,243 --> 00:13:48,351
Helps him decide how to set. Because everyone's different.

233
00:13:49,144 --> 00:13:51,816
Tsukishima, on the other hand, is a special case,

234
00:13:51,841 --> 00:13:55,622
because unlike with the older players,
Sugawara doesn't know much about him.

235
00:13:57,089 --> 00:13:58,589
Oh what's that face for?

236
00:13:58,983 --> 00:14:03,406
It looks like you're thinking "Why should I be
concerned with how a jerk like Tsukishima feels?"

237
00:14:03,431 --> 00:14:05,938
Uh-You don't know what I'm thinking about!

238
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:07,454
'Kay it's sort of like this...

239
00:14:07,752 --> 00:14:10,577
You know how you adjust your
set if Hinata isn't able to hit it?

240
00:14:10,786 --> 00:14:12,948
Yeah.. He'll just swing at nothing.

241
00:14:13,348 --> 00:14:15,834
Well, my point is, our other
spikers have enough technical

242
00:14:15,858 --> 00:14:18,711
prowess to hit the sets that
aren't tailored to their strengths.

243
00:14:19,599 --> 00:14:21,646
So maybe this sounds sort of biased...

244
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:25,834
but you know, if you ask me... we
have some pretty advanced spikers.

245
00:14:26,153 --> 00:14:28,475
Uh, yeah, I agree with that. Sure.

246
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,446
In that case...

247
00:14:30,243 --> 00:14:33,438
Don't you think if they were all hitting at 100%,

248
00:14:33,698 --> 00:14:37,199
they'd be able to compete with
most any blocker they were up against?

249
00:14:40,767 --> 00:14:41,700
One point!

250
00:14:41,977 --> 00:14:43,817
Looks like the Great King's up to serve.

251
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:50,709
Serve-receive W-Formation!

252
00:14:52,216 --> 00:14:56,325
When Oikawa serves... We'll delegate
our defense to just a select few.

253
00:14:57,635 --> 00:14:59,884
That serve of his is a serious threat...

254
00:15:00,419 --> 00:15:03,082
so a moment's hesitation could be the end of us.

255
00:15:03,895 --> 00:15:09,630
So, I say we tackle this using our two
outstanding receivers, Nishinoya and Daichi.

256
00:15:10,129 --> 00:15:12,187
We've never done this formation in a game.

257
00:15:12,659 --> 00:15:14,262
But I think you'll do fine.

258
00:15:14,667 --> 00:15:15,523
We will!

259
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:18,258
Wow!

260
00:15:18,658 --> 00:15:20,640
They have a different rotation this set...

261
00:15:20,847 --> 00:15:23,613
I wonder why they moved it
slightly forward from the first one.

262
00:15:24,344 --> 00:15:26,509
I'm assuming they lined it up like this

263
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:28,660
to match with Oikawa's serve.

264
00:15:29,402 --> 00:15:31,998
Those serves cleaned the floor with us in set 1...

265
00:15:32,892 --> 00:15:35,997
not to mention the 5 points we lost to service aces.

266
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:39,792
Until we can stand up to that
serve, we'll never beat Seijoh.

267
00:15:40,493 --> 00:15:41,462
Here goes!

268
00:15:42,568 --> 00:15:46,690
Ooooooooolé!

269
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,549
Daichi!

270
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:54,610
Yes!

271
00:15:54,974 --> 00:15:56,102
Nice receive!

272
00:15:57,097 --> 00:16:00,521
We really need to score a point to
break the cycle of Oikawa's serve.

273
00:16:01,651 --> 00:16:04,069
If we can, it'll make a huge difference.

274
00:16:05,306 --> 00:16:07,530
But it's gonna put a lot of pressure on one person.

275
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:12,942
I'll send it to the player who broke the flow in
the first set after Oikawa tried to bring him down.

276
00:16:13,024 --> 00:16:14,408
That'll get him back on his feet.

277
00:16:14,865 --> 00:16:15,599
Tanaka!

278
00:16:16,067 --> 00:16:17,074
It's all up to you!

279
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:25,062
Yeah!

280
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:26,675
YEEEEEAAAAAH!

281
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:27,998
Who-ho-hoa!

282
00:16:28,023 --> 00:16:29,471
That's the point breaker!

283
00:16:30,471 --> 00:16:32,484
That was very impressive, captain.

284
00:16:34,922 --> 00:16:35,564
Let's keep it up!

285
00:16:35,589 --> 00:16:36,616
Tsukki!

286
00:16:36,641 --> 00:16:38,215
But you know, if you ask me...

287
00:16:38,361 --> 00:16:40,357
we have some pretty advanced spikers.

288
00:16:40,494 --> 00:16:43,782
Don't you think if they were all hitting at 100%...

289
00:16:43,807 --> 00:16:47,567
they'd be able to compete with
most any blocker they were up against?

290
00:16:52,091 --> 00:16:54,479
Man, our morale is through the roof!

291
00:16:54,808 --> 00:16:58,027
Seijoh's may have us beat in
experience and technical skill.

292
00:16:58,653 --> 00:17:01,621
And it'll be a nightmare if they can pick up a solid lead.

293
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:05,247
But if we hang in there, we
should be able to take control!

294
00:17:10,103 --> 00:17:12,420
Wow, it's anybody's game right now.

295
00:17:13,787 --> 00:17:16,307
I guess... but their blockers are all over us.

296
00:17:16,748 --> 00:17:19,798
Good job, Kindaichi! You're
figuring out all their patterns!

297
00:17:19,865 --> 00:17:20,818
Uh, yes sir.

298
00:17:22,361 --> 00:17:25,509
It's not that Mr. Sunshine and Rainbows is a bad setter.

299
00:17:25,754 --> 00:17:28,502
His attacks are just so textbook and predictable...

300
00:17:28,729 --> 00:17:30,853
He never rushes a setup either.

301
00:17:32,395 --> 00:17:35,855
Listen, Karasuno may have a lot of offensive power,

302
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:39,091
but it's nothing we haven't seen before
from other teams we've played, right?

303
00:17:40,098 --> 00:17:42,494
Now let's leave these losers in the dust.

304
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:46,633
Gotcha!

305
00:17:47,432 --> 00:17:49,809
Y'know... At this point in the game...

306
00:17:50,056 --> 00:17:53,642
I think Seijoh's got a good sense
of what our setter's gonna do next.

307
00:17:54,064 --> 00:17:54,899
I think you're right.

308
00:17:54,942 --> 00:17:59,073
Ooooooooolé!

309
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:07,113
Seijoh scores back-to-back.

310
00:18:07,929 --> 00:18:10,892
Yeah, and the break is where
the flow really starts to move.

311
00:18:11,205 --> 00:18:12,499
We need to crank things up!

312
00:18:13,629 --> 00:18:18,088
Karasuno's been using their left players a lot
since they swapped out their setter, haven't they?

313
00:18:18,314 --> 00:18:22,507
Well, that's because each of their lefts
is a force to be reckoned with... Still...

314
00:18:22,771 --> 00:18:26,832
I'm sure they're easier to deal with than
that number 10's constant bobbing and weaving.

315
00:18:29,455 --> 00:18:31,759
It's like there's a noose tightening around my neck.

316
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:34,701
And yet I feel so calm.

317
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:37,524
Impatience isn't clouding my judgment.

318
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,109
I guess because I have a clear goal right in front of me.

319
00:18:42,954 --> 00:18:44,629
Yeah, let's get that point!

320
00:18:46,009 --> 00:18:48,205
I used to think that if I got benched...

321
00:18:48,425 --> 00:18:51,195
it meant I wasn't useful to the team anymore...

322
00:18:51,802 --> 00:18:54,706
Honestly, that probably was the reason back then.

323
00:18:55,685 --> 00:18:56,212
But...

324
00:18:56,798 --> 00:18:58,907
Now I have you right there behind me.

325
00:18:59,873 --> 00:19:01,019
That's reassuring.

326
00:19:02,312 --> 00:19:04,580
Sugawara and I have different strengths,

327
00:19:05,187 --> 00:19:07,188
but I think our goal is the same.

328
00:19:08,497 --> 00:19:09,506
Left side!

329
00:19:11,803 --> 00:19:12,543
Heads up!

330
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,273
Open!

331
00:19:17,601 --> 00:19:19,927
All I want is to play volleyball!

332
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,800
I want to be in this game!

333
00:19:22,637 --> 00:19:25,621
I want to stay longer... Just a little longer!

334
00:19:26,374 --> 00:19:28,112
The intensity of the court...

335
00:19:28,967 --> 00:19:31,828
Please... let me keep playing with my team!

336
00:19:32,794 --> 00:19:34,375
The rush of adrenaline...

337
00:19:34,903 --> 00:19:36,238
I don't want to leave!

338
00:19:36,692 --> 00:19:39,650
I want to be out there fighting... and winning!

339
00:19:39,763 --> 00:19:41,685
I want to make these sets myself!

340
00:19:42,094 --> 00:19:43,112
I have to!

341
00:19:44,101 --> 00:19:44,629
So...

342
00:19:45,242 --> 00:19:47,419
So I will give it my absolute best...

343
00:19:48,067 --> 00:19:49,722
and you give it your best, too...

344
00:19:50,296 --> 00:19:50,960
and that...

345
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:53,921
That is how we're going to win this game!

346
00:19:55,021 --> 00:19:56,118
Nice receive!

347
00:20:01,997 --> 00:20:02,894
YES!

348
00:20:02,919 --> 00:20:03,794
Awesome block!

349
00:20:08,658 --> 00:20:09,816
Sorry Hinata...

350
00:20:10,173 --> 00:20:12,542
That last quick attack took me longer than it should have.

351
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,713
Oh! No it's fine...

352
00:20:14,899 --> 00:20:16,820
They're calling for Karasuno's number 9.

353
00:20:17,108 --> 00:20:18,574
I guess they're switching setters.

354
00:20:22,181 --> 00:20:23,413
My time's running out.

355
00:20:24,295 --> 00:20:24,948
Suga.

356
00:20:26,899 --> 00:20:29,993
Send me the next ball, okay? I'll make it count.

357
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:34,642
Right!

358
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:36,293
Serve's up!

359
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:51,596
Amazing.

360
00:21:07,173 --> 00:21:08,497
I hate to admit it, but...

361
00:21:10,969 --> 00:21:13,067
Well, when Hinata hits your sets...

362
00:21:13,334 --> 00:21:15,229
somehow he looks completely different.

363
00:21:17,588 --> 00:21:19,472
And... I'm sure you know this...

364
00:21:21,087 --> 00:21:23,642
but everyone on our team is good at what they do.

365
00:21:24,803 --> 00:21:25,428
Yeah.

366
00:21:26,705 --> 00:21:27,802
So go wi...

367
00:21:32,438 --> 00:21:33,117
Let's win.

368
00:21:35,635 --> 00:21:36,300
Right!

369
00:21:36,956 --> 00:21:37,611
Good job.

370
00:21:37,864 --> 00:21:38,657
Well done.

371
00:21:39,092 --> 00:21:41,765
Yeah, You kept it neck and neck against those guys.

372
00:21:42,689 --> 00:21:44,124
That's because we're a great team.

373
00:21:44,417 --> 00:21:45,424
Listen here, kid...

374
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:49,885
From here on in, I think we'll be pushing
this setter route as aggressively as we can.

375
00:21:52,626 --> 00:21:54,364
Sure! Thank you, sir!

376
00:21:56,556 --> 00:21:57,578
What was that?

377
00:21:58,184 --> 00:22:00,702
Well, you are talking in his setter language.

378
00:22:01,078 --> 00:22:03,147
That's probably music to his ears.

379
00:22:04,038 --> 00:22:08,493
If everyone does their best to succeed,
then I'm confident we can beat Seijoh...

380
00:22:09,685 --> 00:22:10,183
But...

381
00:22:11,414 --> 00:22:12,778
to get the boost we need,

382
00:22:13,431 --> 00:22:18,772
the best bet for Karasuno is to have its
greatest decoy working at 100% of his potential.

383
00:22:21,093 --> 00:22:22,491
And the one to make that happen...

384
00:22:24,203 --> 00:22:26,942
will be you... Kageyama.

385
00:23:58,634 --> 00:23:59,960
Welcome back, Tobio!

386
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,318
Watch it, pretty boy.

387
00:24:01,343 --> 00:24:04,948
Now, now, settle down.
We know you're not capable of anything serious.

388
00:24:04,973 --> 00:24:08,053
Tsukishima, he's meaner than you! You gonna take that?!

389
00:24:08,078 --> 00:24:09,964
It's not a competition, Hinata...

390
00:24:10,297 --> 00:24:12,397
Next Haikyu!! "Evolution."
