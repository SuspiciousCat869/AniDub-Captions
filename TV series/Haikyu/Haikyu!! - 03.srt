1
00:00:07,402 --> 00:00:09,434
Dammit, stop dragging your feet!

2
00:00:09,869 --> 00:00:13,330
What happened to those reflexes you had? Get it together!

3
00:00:14,638 --> 00:00:16,520
All I've been doing is receives...

4
00:00:16,806 --> 00:00:20,627
Kageyama, we're running out of time! I
wanna jump around! I wanna do some spikes!

5
00:00:20,652 --> 00:00:21,404
Well that's too bad!

6
00:00:21,429 --> 00:00:22,818
That's enough!

7
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,260
A word to the wise.

8
00:00:25,709 --> 00:00:30,712
Daichi's a nice guy most of the time,
but you will not like him when he's mad. Trust me.

9
00:00:33,854 --> 00:00:35,051
Yeah, we know.

10
00:00:35,188 --> 00:00:37,416
If he were to find out we're practicing early...

11
00:00:37,582 --> 00:00:38,680
I'm so dead.

12
00:00:39,393 --> 00:00:43,911
Not that I'm afraid of him or anything! Of
course not. That would be ridiculously ridiculous!

13
00:00:43,936 --> 00:00:44,316
Hm?

14
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:50,410
Anyway, it's probably for the best if we keep this
little practice session a secret between the three of us-

15
00:00:51,104 --> 00:00:53,493
Aha! Just as I suspected!

16
00:00:53,826 --> 00:00:54,620
Suga!

17
00:00:54,993 --> 00:00:55,717
Hey.

18
00:00:56,006 --> 00:00:57,312
How'd you know?!

19
00:00:57,847 --> 00:00:59,910
Come on. Something was obviously up...

20
00:00:59,955 --> 00:01:02,221
I mean, why else would you
offer to take the key to the gym

21
00:01:02,245 --> 00:01:04,735
when you always show up to practice at the last minute?

22
00:01:06,607 --> 00:01:09,478
Don't worry, I won't tell. Your secret's safe with me.

23
00:01:09,953 --> 00:01:12,944
A clandestine crash course. That's pretty exciting.

24
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:51,749
Whoo, I'm on fire!

25
00:02:52,502 --> 00:02:54,197
Hey, you're not paying attention.

26
00:02:54,222 --> 00:02:57,716
Hey, I wanna hit too! Throw me a bone here, Kageyama!

27
00:02:59,277 --> 00:03:00,996
You're all about your sets, aren'tcha?

28
00:03:01,229 --> 00:03:03,029
Go ahead, send one over this way!

29
00:03:04,874 --> 00:03:06,091
Come on, just one!

30
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:06,587
I don't think he wants to.

31
00:03:06,612 --> 00:03:07,500
For practice!

32
00:03:07,612 --> 00:03:08,318
Please?

33
00:03:09,609 --> 00:03:10,053
No.

34
00:03:11,966 --> 00:03:13,660
Aw man, don't be like that!

35
00:03:13,691 --> 00:03:15,183
Yeah, dude, send him one!

36
00:03:15,487 --> 00:03:16,109
Mmph!

37
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:18,228
Fwup! Ah.

38
00:03:19,636 --> 00:03:23,540
I sent that one head-on...
You received to make a set and attack...

39
00:03:23,674 --> 00:03:25,916
Don't run your mouth if you can't follow through.

40
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:30,420
I'll be sending all the sets to
Tanaka during the match on Saturday.

41
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:35,695
Leave all the attacking to him... You
just do your best to not get in my way.

42
00:03:39,122 --> 00:03:44,699
Okay fine, then as soon as I get good enough at receives.
Will you at least throw a few sets to me too?

43
00:03:45,644 --> 00:03:48,035
I'll set to whoever I have to to win.

44
00:03:49,852 --> 00:03:53,683
It's just... I highly doubt
that person is going to be you.

45
00:03:55,206 --> 00:03:56,434
Watch your mouth!

46
00:03:56,459 --> 00:03:59,093
How's he ever gonna learn if you don't set to him?

47
00:03:59,169 --> 00:04:01,121
It's almost 7. We should clean up.

48
00:04:01,146 --> 00:04:03,602
Oh, crap! Hurry up! We can't leave any traces!

49
00:04:03,627 --> 00:04:04,752
We need to find a mop!

50
00:04:07,186 --> 00:04:08,241
Dammit!

51
00:04:23,623 --> 00:04:26,385
Try this... drop your hips down a little bit lower

52
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:29,508
and hit the ball like you're trying to return it
to exactly where it came from.

53
00:04:29,533 --> 00:04:30,286
Okay!

54
00:04:30,518 --> 00:04:31,278
Here we go!

55
00:04:32,769 --> 00:04:34,505
Ooh, nice one!

56
00:04:34,538 --> 00:04:38,612
Hey, Hinata. How about I start setting
for you tomorrow morning? Would you like that?

57
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:40,719
What? You mean it?! Really?!

58
00:04:41,227 --> 00:04:44,333
Well, I am Karasuno high's official setter, after all...

59
00:04:44,558 --> 00:04:46,333
And you want to practice spikes, right?

60
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:53,292
Exactly! Spikes are my favorite thing to do!
When you hit the ball just right... it feels so cool!

61
00:04:54,154 --> 00:04:56,469
I guess you really got a thing for spikes, don't you?

62
00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:00,371
Yeah... when I was in middle school,
I could barely get teammates at all...

63
00:05:00,396 --> 00:05:02,826
Much less a setter to toss practice balls with me.

64
00:05:03,194 --> 00:05:06,172
I used to get my friend in basketball club to help me out.

65
00:05:08,062 --> 00:05:11,098
Ah, oops, sorry, I hit it the wrong way again!

66
00:05:11,337 --> 00:05:16,151
After I dropped out of the club, I would ask
the first-years, the setters from the girls' team.

67
00:05:16,185 --> 00:05:19,269
And pretty much anybody who
didn't say no to practice with me.

68
00:05:19,848 --> 00:05:21,847
I made a lot of friends along the way...

69
00:05:22,711 --> 00:05:25,779
But none of those people could
ever become my real teammates.

70
00:05:28,171 --> 00:05:31,636
That's why... I was so excited
to see who the setters were here.

71
00:05:31,661 --> 00:05:32,819
You're an idiot.

72
00:05:33,362 --> 00:05:34,440
And now, uh...

73
00:05:34,764 --> 00:05:36,076
You're clumsy.

74
00:05:36,644 --> 00:05:37,811
You know the rest.

75
00:05:37,983 --> 00:05:41,688
Well like I said, I'm a setter too...
I'll toss you a few, okay?

76
00:05:44,926 --> 00:05:48,709
That'd be nice, but...
If I were to say yes after telling you all that...

77
00:05:48,881 --> 00:05:52,229
It kinda feels like... I would
be admitting that he beat me.

78
00:05:54,332 --> 00:05:57,284
So why do you get so competitive
when it comes to Kageyama?

79
00:05:58,067 --> 00:06:01,507
If you ask me, it's better to avoid
making enemies with guys like that.

80
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:07,759
That day at the tournament...
Kageyama was so good at everything he did.

81
00:06:08,013 --> 00:06:11,319
And he was way taller than me... and stronger.

82
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:16,097
It just really bothered me to see
him standing in my way like that.

83
00:06:16,122 --> 00:06:17,359
Yeah, I think I get it.

84
00:06:19,398 --> 00:06:22,760
That's why I came to Karasuno...
Because I want to beat him!

85
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:25,976
Really? If he's the reason you came here...

86
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:28,975
Then is he whole the reason you
play volleyball in the first place?

87
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,213
Ah! Um, well...

88
00:06:31,238 --> 00:06:33,224
Is he practicing during lunch?

89
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:37,155
I just think that if I can get strong
enough to finally win against Kageyama...

90
00:06:37,286 --> 00:06:41,008
Then I will be able to stand up
to all kinds of tough opponents...

91
00:06:41,243 --> 00:06:43,647
Cause I've never seen anyone play like him.

92
00:06:44,092 --> 00:06:46,007
I don't ever want to lose again!

93
00:06:47,772 --> 00:06:52,538
I see. So what you're saying is, if you had
to rank all the players in your own age group,

94
00:06:52,563 --> 00:06:55,477
you'd give Kageyama the top
spot? That's quite an endorsement.

95
00:06:57,939 --> 00:06:58,956
Well...

96
00:07:01,593 --> 00:07:03,120
He doesn't want to admit it.

97
00:07:04,086 --> 00:07:06,305
He's no longer your most powerful enemy...

98
00:07:07,081 --> 00:07:09,010
Now, he's your most powerful ally.

99
00:07:11,576 --> 00:07:13,839
I can do everything without your help.

100
00:07:16,925 --> 00:07:18,665
Anyway, let's do some receives.

101
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:19,356
Sure!

102
00:07:23,494 --> 00:07:25,188
Thanks for taking out the trash!

103
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:33,703
1, 2, 3, 4!

104
00:07:33,728 --> 00:07:36,283
5, 6, 7, 8.

105
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:39,495
2, 2, 3, 4.

106
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,313
5, 6, 7, 8.

107
00:07:42,849 --> 00:07:46,794
Legs! 1, 2, 3, 4.

108
00:07:46,819 --> 00:07:49,321
5, 6, 7, 8.

109
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:52,874
2, 2, 3, 4.

110
00:07:52,899 --> 00:07:55,351
5, 6, 7, 8.

111
00:07:56,072 --> 00:07:58,496
Arms! 1, 2, 3, 4.

112
00:07:58,570 --> 00:07:59,570
Let's go.

113
00:08:00,049 --> 00:08:02,516
What?! Sorry, where are we going now?

114
00:08:02,807 --> 00:08:07,538
Well it's not like we can play volleyball
here, can we? I found a practice spot.

115
00:08:07,563 --> 00:08:11,863
Ah? Really?! Where is it?! Wow, great job, Kageyama!

116
00:08:11,888 --> 00:08:13,688
Oh my god, you're so annoying!

117
00:08:13,715 --> 00:08:15,319
What? What do ya mean?

118
00:08:37,414 --> 00:08:39,369
You two look sleepier than usual.

119
00:08:40,694 --> 00:08:43,581
Uh, really? Maybe I've been
studying too hard or something...

120
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:44,739
I've been studying hard too!

121
00:08:44,764 --> 00:08:46,974
It doesn't sound very convincing when you say it!

122
00:08:46,999 --> 00:08:47,538
Eat it!

123
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:49,030
Excuse us.

124
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:52,794
Oh.. Hey guys. These are the other new first-years.

125
00:08:53,221 --> 00:08:58,853
Normally we'd wait 'til next week to start new
members, but since we have that match on Saturday,

126
00:08:58,878 --> 00:09:01,274
We're making an exception and bringing them in now.

127
00:09:01,299 --> 00:09:02,500
Nice to meet you!

128
00:09:05,952 --> 00:09:08,557
Be aware of your feet and your hands!

129
00:09:09,668 --> 00:09:11,735
Hey, I need you to focus!

130
00:09:12,043 --> 00:09:13,452
I know, I know!

131
00:09:14,688 --> 00:09:17,042
We're gonna win this match and get let into the gym!

132
00:09:18,204 --> 00:09:19,847
And then we'll play for real!

133
00:09:20,605 --> 00:09:24,695
Oh... right, I forgot. If we lose on
Saturday, you don't ever get to be the setter.

134
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,743
That's why I need you to focus!

135
00:09:30,101 --> 00:09:30,781
Gaah!

136
00:09:32,115 --> 00:09:36,006
I told you, you gotta ease up a
little when we're practicing outside!

137
00:09:36,071 --> 00:09:38,827
If you could receive worth a damn, I wouldn't have to!

138
00:09:39,067 --> 00:09:41,929
Pardon me... your majesty.

139
00:09:42,611 --> 00:09:43,327
What?

140
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:45,280
Ah! Uh-oh.

141
00:09:46,303 --> 00:09:46,830
Tch.

142
00:09:50,424 --> 00:09:53,716
What's with him? He doesn't like being king of the court?

143
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:55,909
I think that's a pretty cool nickname.

144
00:09:56,783 --> 00:10:01,107
Hey, I wonder if I'll get a
nickname too? Just like the tiny giant!

145
00:10:01,822 --> 00:10:06,550
The wind of the... whirlwind!
No wait, that' too much wind.

146
00:10:06,575 --> 00:10:13,509
The forest... no that's lame... The
shadowy, um... the north eastern... tornado?

147
00:10:13,534 --> 00:10:14,984
Hey! Pull your head out!

148
00:10:15,009 --> 00:10:18,953
So anyway, what do you think the
first-years we're gonna be up against are like?

149
00:10:18,978 --> 00:10:21,184
They can't be tougher than the upperclassmen.

150
00:10:21,209 --> 00:10:26,061
It makes no difference to me how skilled they
are... we'll defeat them no matter what they're like.

151
00:10:26,172 --> 00:10:28,606
You're right. That's exactly what I was gonna say!

152
00:10:29,496 --> 00:10:30,102
Tch.

153
00:10:30,127 --> 00:10:32,784
Don't you "tch" me! One more time!

154
00:10:35,508 --> 00:10:37,720
You've got to learn to stop receiving with your face!

155
00:10:39,909 --> 00:10:43,588
I can't put my finger on it, but there's
something I don't like about those rookies.

156
00:10:43,815 --> 00:10:46,807
But you never like anybody when
you first meet them, Tanaka...

157
00:10:47,158 --> 00:10:49,638
It's you... you're just a paranoid guy.

158
00:10:49,663 --> 00:10:51,376
I don't like your tone...

159
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:53,866
They're a bit further along than I expected they'd be...

160
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:56,523
You think Saturday's game will be okay?

161
00:10:56,623 --> 00:11:00,332
Are you kiddin'? Of course it will!
They've got yours truly on their side!

162
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:03,558
Well, at least Kageyama's good.

163
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:08,515
You know, I think he's actually calmed down
a bit since middle school. That's positive.

164
00:11:08,563 --> 00:11:11,731
What?! No way, he's a snotty little shit!

165
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,270
Well, he seemed to have absolute
confidence in himself back then...

166
00:11:15,302 --> 00:11:18,992
Maybe over confident. He's a lot
less brazen now, don't you think?

167
00:11:20,126 --> 00:11:22,089
Okay, but he's still a little shit.

168
00:11:22,325 --> 00:11:26,109
Oh, right, my bad... Maybe you're
not the best person to ask about that.

169
00:11:26,636 --> 00:11:29,854
Uh... hey... That's not cool...

170
00:11:37,099 --> 00:11:40,245
Okay... one more try!

171
00:11:41,779 --> 00:11:42,388
You ready?

172
00:11:42,413 --> 00:11:43,023
Yeah!

173
00:11:45,555 --> 00:11:46,352
Behind you!

174
00:11:46,377 --> 00:11:47,106
Gotcha!

175
00:11:49,657 --> 00:11:52,061
Are you guys seriously practicing out here?

176
00:11:53,898 --> 00:11:57,162
You must be the first-years who
made all that trouble on the first day.

177
00:11:57,187 --> 00:11:59,681
T-shirts, out here? Aren't you cold?

178
00:11:59,728 --> 00:12:01,605
Whoa, they're tall!

179
00:12:01,867 --> 00:12:03,562
Give it back! Hey!

180
00:12:03,587 --> 00:12:06,522
Shouldn't you elementary schoolers be home at this hour?

181
00:12:08,266 --> 00:12:09,948
Who are you supposed to be?!

182
00:12:09,973 --> 00:12:12,219
I guess you're the other new first-year players.

183
00:12:12,244 --> 00:12:12,655
Hm?

184
00:12:12,806 --> 00:12:13,608
Quiet!

185
00:12:13,633 --> 00:12:14,306
Interesting.

186
00:12:14,331 --> 00:12:15,283
I'll do the talking!

187
00:12:15,308 --> 00:12:16,679
Question.. How tall are you?

188
00:12:16,704 --> 00:12:17,378
Hey!

189
00:12:17,572 --> 00:12:20,301
Glad you asked! Tsukki here happens to be six-two!

190
00:12:20,455 --> 00:12:22,185
He's almost six foot three!

191
00:12:22,258 --> 00:12:23,396
Six foot two?!

192
00:12:23,421 --> 00:12:26,335
What's the point of you bragging
about how tall I am, Tadashi?

193
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,882
You're right, sorry, Tsukki.

194
00:12:29,597 --> 00:12:32,419
You're Kageyama from Kitagawa first, aren't you?

195
00:12:32,494 --> 00:12:32,927
Tch.

196
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:35,504
A star player like you at a school like this...

197
00:12:35,529 --> 00:12:36,233
So?

198
00:12:36,694 --> 00:12:37,820
Look, pal!

199
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:38,606
Hm?

200
00:12:38,631 --> 00:12:41,608
We're not gonna lose to you, do you understand me?!

201
00:12:48,411 --> 00:12:49,564
Isn't that cute?

202
00:12:50,861 --> 00:12:54,115
I didn't realize that little skirmish
actually meant something to you...

203
00:12:54,414 --> 00:12:55,942
We couldn't care less about it.

204
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:56,437
Huh?

205
00:12:56,462 --> 00:13:01,023
We're not concerned with winning or losing,
but if it's that important to you two...

206
00:13:02,015 --> 00:13:03,839
Maybe... we'll just throw the game.

207
00:13:03,864 --> 00:13:05,200
You mean whaaaat?!

208
00:13:05,465 --> 00:13:08,803
Fine... I don't care if you throw
it or work yourselves to death...

209
00:13:09,102 --> 00:13:10,972
Cause I'm still going to win on Saturday.

210
00:13:10,997 --> 00:13:12,615
You mean "we" right?!

211
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:16,633
So confident! Well that's the king for you!

212
00:13:17,893 --> 00:13:19,926
Hey... don't call me that.

213
00:13:19,959 --> 00:13:21,279
Ha, I knew it.

214
00:13:22,216 --> 00:13:25,817
Rumor has it you lose your cool every
time someone brings up your old nickname.

215
00:13:26,392 --> 00:13:31,297
But who wouldn't want to be king of the
court? I mean it really suits you, right? Your highness?

216
00:13:31,322 --> 00:13:32,803
Your funeral, dude.

217
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:34,726
What is your problem?

218
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:44,649
I saw you, you know? At the finals.

219
00:13:45,331 --> 00:13:45,787
Hm?

220
00:13:45,812 --> 00:13:52,174
I still can't believe your teammates put up with all those
selfish sets you used to toss up... I know I wouldn't. Oh!

221
00:13:52,673 --> 00:13:55,720
So that's why you're here! I
bet they finally got sick of you.

222
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:00,730
Tsukki!

223
00:14:06,694 --> 00:14:10,358
What the? I don't really
understand what's going on...

224
00:14:10,794 --> 00:14:14,139
But it's not like him to not just
say anything back to these jerks!

225
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:18,206
Come on, Kageyama, get the last word
as you walk away like you always do!

226
00:14:18,246 --> 00:14:19,090
We're leaving.

227
00:14:20,154 --> 00:14:21,609
What?! Wait!

228
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:25,372
Running off? Guess the king's not a threat after all.

229
00:14:26,418 --> 00:14:29,519
I hope his majesty puts up more of a fight on Saturday.

230
00:14:33,447 --> 00:14:37,506
Would you just shut up about
the stupid king?! I'm here too!

231
00:14:38,306 --> 00:14:40,740
You have no idea what I'm capable of!

232
00:14:41,095 --> 00:14:41,933
Oh yeah?

233
00:14:43,093 --> 00:14:47,214
What's that look for anyway, buddy?!
Are you trying to start something with me?!

234
00:14:49,262 --> 00:14:54,023
There's no need to argue, alright?
Let's all just enjoy playing some volleyball together.

235
00:14:54,258 --> 00:14:55,549
It's just a game, right?

236
00:14:56,776 --> 00:14:58,229
What's that supposed to mean?!

237
00:14:58,254 --> 00:15:00,994
Exactly what it sounds like. Bye.

238
00:15:01,202 --> 00:15:04,774
Hey, not so fast!
You never told me who you are!

239
00:15:05,303 --> 00:15:07,934
I'm Kei Tsukishima, Year 1 Class 4.

240
00:15:08,269 --> 00:15:09,858
I'm Tadashi Yamaguchi.

241
00:15:09,883 --> 00:15:12,824
As of today, we're officially your new teammates...

242
00:15:12,989 --> 00:15:18,293
Even if doesn't feel like it... Anyway, I'm
looking forward to his majesty's royal sets.

243
00:15:18,435 --> 00:15:19,075
See ya!

244
00:15:21,153 --> 00:15:26,646
What is their deal? Those two are some major
league butt wads. We should show those pukes who's boss!

245
00:15:27,002 --> 00:15:28,543
That goes without saying.

246
00:15:29,389 --> 00:15:30,983
Hey, where're ya going?

247
00:15:31,075 --> 00:15:31,533
Huh?

248
00:15:32,195 --> 00:15:34,163
We still got some work to do, don't we?

249
00:15:38,198 --> 00:15:40,647
Hey Tsukki, wait up! Is something wrong?

250
00:15:41,237 --> 00:15:45,025
I hate guys like that... Always
trying a little bit too hard.

251
00:15:46,077 --> 00:15:48,525
They're both a touch over-zealous for my taste.

252
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:57,498
Focus! You have to brace faster than that!

253
00:15:57,523 --> 00:15:59,452
How late are they planning to practice?

254
00:15:59,477 --> 00:16:00,049
I know!

255
00:16:00,074 --> 00:16:04,826
Eh, who even knows with these two knuckleheads...
All I know is I'm sleepy.

256
00:16:07,904 --> 00:16:09,262
Your majesty.

257
00:16:12,852 --> 00:16:16,721
Quit it, Kageyama! It's too dark to
see out here. Don't hit it so hard!

258
00:16:18,286 --> 00:16:19,107
Sorry.

259
00:16:22,817 --> 00:16:26,804
He doesn't look sorry at all.
What's gotten into him all of a sudden?

260
00:16:27,102 --> 00:16:30,100
He's been extra tense since we ran into that tall guy.

261
00:16:30,747 --> 00:16:33,723
But I can't really spike if he won't send me anymore sets.

262
00:16:34,366 --> 00:16:37,692
I guess I'll just do my best at
receiving until he decides to do one.

263
00:16:38,398 --> 00:16:40,632
Hey! Try another one of those!

264
00:18:15,729 --> 00:18:19,433
That's new. He couldn't handle
a ball at that speed before!

265
00:18:19,569 --> 00:18:21,930
Okay! Now no holding back!

266
00:18:22,409 --> 00:18:23,531
Fine by me!

267
00:18:26,182 --> 00:18:32,440
Whoops, overslept!
I'm so late, I'm so late, the boss is gonna murder me!

268
00:18:32,465 --> 00:18:35,571
Kiyoko made me breakfast, so I couldn't leave the house!

269
00:18:36,382 --> 00:18:39,427
Yeah I wish... hm, huh?

270
00:18:46,775 --> 00:18:49,905
Damn, how long have they been back and forth like that?

271
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:52,784
Well, I got here 15 minutes ago, so...

272
00:18:52,809 --> 00:18:54,387
It's been non-stop?!

273
00:18:54,944 --> 00:18:55,517
Wow.

274
00:18:57,546 --> 00:19:00,952
He makes up for his bad technique
with raw athleticism, but...

275
00:19:02,112 --> 00:19:03,812
Everybody has their limit!

276
00:19:05,354 --> 00:19:05,616
Let's take a break for-uh?

277
00:19:05,641 --> 00:19:06,743
Not yet!

278
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:09,491
No! It hasn't hit the floor!

279
00:19:10,139 --> 00:19:11,085
Okay, fine!

280
00:19:12,012 --> 00:19:13,830
That's brutal! Can he hit that?

281
00:19:13,864 --> 00:19:15,291
Damn, force of habit.

282
00:19:15,587 --> 00:19:18,588
Hinata's had amazing athletic ability since middle school.

283
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:20,541
Huh?

284
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:26,806
But... besides all of that... He's got this...
insane thirst for victory that keeps him going.

285
00:19:27,138 --> 00:19:33,162
His weapon isn't physical prowess and it's
definitely not size... It's something else...

286
00:19:33,915 --> 00:19:39,853
It's that every time the going gets tough... He has
just enough left in him to take it one step further!

287
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:50,446
He did it! Nice one, little man!

288
00:19:51,371 --> 00:19:53,680
I'll set to whoever I have to to win...

289
00:19:55,292 --> 00:19:59,158
It's just... I highly doubt
that person is going to be you.

290
00:20:02,005 --> 00:20:03,979
I don't ever want to lose again!

291
00:20:06,685 --> 00:20:08,830
But it's... not over yet.

292
00:20:11,184 --> 00:20:11,755
Huh?

293
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:15,997
Here we go!

294
00:20:16,022 --> 00:20:17,830
There it is! He finally set him one!

295
00:20:18,014 --> 00:20:18,803
Too bad.

296
00:20:19,298 --> 00:20:22,081
There's no way he's got enough
strength left to spike it down.

297
00:20:33,861 --> 00:20:36,160
I gotta hand it to him, the kid can jump.

298
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:41,330
Can't believe he managed to hit that.
Check out the stupid look on his face.

299
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,875
So I guess getting a set must be
really important to the guy, huh?

300
00:20:44,972 --> 00:20:45,560
Huh?

301
00:20:46,386 --> 00:20:52,169
I made a lot of friends along the way... But none
of those people could ever become my real teammates.

302
00:20:53,355 --> 00:20:57,389
I suppose getting tosses from the setter
was just something we've always taken for granted.

303
00:20:58,585 --> 00:20:59,067
Hey.

304
00:20:59,092 --> 00:20:59,838
Huh?

305
00:21:01,483 --> 00:21:03,970
Tomorrow... we'll win.

306
00:21:05,548 --> 00:21:07,797
But he's no longer your most powerful enemy...

307
00:21:09,167 --> 00:21:11,620
Now he's my most powerful ally.

308
00:21:14,184 --> 00:21:14,797
Hmph.

309
00:21:15,781 --> 00:21:17,950
Yeah? Tell me something I don't know!

310
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:23,535
That's sick!

311
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:28,304
Tanaka, get some water! Oh god... and a bucket!
A-and some towels...

312
00:21:44,191 --> 00:21:46,028
Quit running, you little moron!

313
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:55,123
Why are you dorks wasting precious energy right
before a game? You should take a breather, idiots.

314
00:21:55,795 --> 00:21:57,781
Man... we tied...

315
00:21:59,089 --> 00:22:02,223
I can'... let you.. Beat me...

316
00:22:02,248 --> 00:22:03,493
Back atcha...

317
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:08,734
This guy really gets on my nerves...

318
00:22:14,883 --> 00:22:19,642
He's gonna start sending the ball
my way now... Sets from a real setter!

319
00:22:20,164 --> 00:22:21,711
You ready to win this or what?

320
00:22:25,572 --> 00:22:27,063
We need to go and get set up.

321
00:22:27,373 --> 00:22:27,957
Yeah.

322
00:22:28,588 --> 00:22:29,919
Morning, my liege!

323
00:22:36,485 --> 00:22:37,386
This time...

324
00:22:38,017 --> 00:22:40,055
I'll break through any wall they put up!

325
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:17,562
Kageyama's such a whimp. He
didn't even stand up for himself.

326
00:24:17,587 --> 00:24:18,841
Shut it, Tadashi.

327
00:24:18,866 --> 00:24:19,595
Sorry.

328
00:24:19,926 --> 00:24:23,298
It's time to see what
the king's made of. And the shorty too.

329
00:24:23,396 --> 00:24:26,730
Grr! Next Haikyu! " The view from the summit!"
