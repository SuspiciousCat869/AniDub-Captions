1
00:00:11,851 --> 00:00:13,588
A perfect receive.

2
00:00:16,004 --> 00:00:17,322
Is this who they meant?

3
00:00:18,622 --> 00:00:19,039
Huh?

4
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:23,602
Uh? Are you shorter than me?

5
00:00:24,147 --> 00:00:26,600
Hey! You had better watch what you say to me!

6
00:00:26,625 --> 00:00:28,141
Whoa, I am so sorry!

7
00:00:28,849 --> 00:00:32,209
Um anyway... I just wanted to know how tall you are.

8
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:35,173
I'm 5'2, that good enough for ya?!

9
00:00:35,375 --> 00:00:37,645
He's barely in the 5-foot range!

10
00:00:38,893 --> 00:00:40,647
Wha... what's with you?

11
00:00:41,247 --> 00:00:45,102
Somebody to look down at... I haven't
had that feeling since middle school!

12
00:00:45,127 --> 00:00:48,347
You freaking kidding me! You're not looking that far down!

13
00:00:48,823 --> 00:00:51,658
Huh? Long time no see, Nishinoya!

14
00:00:51,683 --> 00:00:53,328
Heey, how's it goin', Tanaka?

15
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:54,906
Nishinoya!

16
00:00:55,147 --> 00:00:55,822
Yo!

17
00:00:56,798 --> 00:00:58,339
Oh, that's right, you haven't met yet.

18
00:00:58,902 --> 00:01:00,516
Nishinoya's a second-year.

19
00:01:00,541 --> 00:01:01,105
Hey!

20
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:03,312
Cool, nice to meet you, first-years!

21
00:01:03,559 --> 00:01:06,926
Hey, I got a question for the
angry-looking guy that just threw that serve!

22
00:01:07,128 --> 00:01:08,445
Where did you come from?

23
00:01:09,535 --> 00:01:10,685
Went to Kitagawa.

24
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:14,372
Seriously?! That's a great
school. No wonder you're so talented!

25
00:01:14,547 --> 00:01:17,691
I played against those guys in
middle school and they beat us 2 to 1!

26
00:01:18,147 --> 00:01:19,580
They had someone back then who
could serve even better than you!

27
00:01:19,614 --> 00:01:22,085
Okay, looks like he still a chatterbox.

28
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:25,280
Um... anyway, so um where did you go to middle school?

29
00:01:25,513 --> 00:01:26,672
Chidori-Yama!

30
00:01:27,661 --> 00:01:30,311
Wow, they're pretty good too! Why'd you come here?

31
00:01:31,114 --> 00:01:34,140
Is it... because you heard coach Ukai was coming back?

32
00:01:34,763 --> 00:01:38,392
Not really... I wanted to come back here because...

33
00:01:39,495 --> 00:01:40,218
Well...

34
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:45,928
Karasuno's school uniforms for
female students... are the hottest!

35
00:01:45,953 --> 00:01:47,042
Hm?

36
00:01:47,349 --> 00:01:51,018
But not just that! The girls
themselves aren't half bad either! Whoo!

37
00:01:51,043 --> 00:01:52,679
But most of all... yeow!

38
00:01:53,649 --> 00:01:56,602
Our uniforms are awesome too... And black!

39
00:01:56,627 --> 00:01:59,879
My middle school had blazers, so
I've always like military style...

40
00:01:59,935 --> 00:02:01,810
And they just have to be black!

41
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:03,426
I know what you mean brotha!

42
00:02:03,451 --> 00:02:05,416
So the uniforms are perfecto...

43
00:02:05,441 --> 00:02:06,908
All the ladies are beautiful...

44
00:02:07,096 --> 00:02:09,857
And a short commute! It was a no-brainer!

45
00:02:10,254 --> 00:02:10,659
Hm?!

46
00:02:11,288 --> 00:02:15,491
Ah! Oh my god it's Kiyoko! Come to my arms, sweet mama!

47
00:02:16,366 --> 00:02:18,923
So I guess hasn't changed all that much has he.

48
00:02:19,043 --> 00:02:21,709
I know right... he can be pretty noisy.

49
00:02:22,073 --> 00:02:23,955
But whenever he gets focused on the game...

50
00:02:25,698 --> 00:02:26,893
Not so much.

51
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,756
So... where's Asahi? Is he back yet?

52
00:02:31,186 --> 00:02:32,390
Ah...

53
00:02:32,535 --> 00:02:33,305
Well, uh...

54
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:34,502
Ah?

55
00:02:35,388 --> 00:02:35,959
Tch!

56
00:02:37,301 --> 00:02:38,446
Damn coward!

57
00:02:39,371 --> 00:02:42,234
Hey Noya! Show some respect for your upperclassman-

58
00:02:42,259 --> 00:02:45,814
Oh shut up! He's a scared little crybaby and you know it!

59
00:02:45,839 --> 00:02:48,420
If Asahi's not coming back then neither am I!

60
00:02:48,724 --> 00:02:50,366
Hey! Noya, wait!

61
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:30,085
My job... is just to keep the ball in play.

62
00:04:31,248 --> 00:04:35,416
The sky belongs to the spikers.
I can't compete in their space.

63
00:04:37,499 --> 00:04:42,057
But if I can just keep the ball up in the
air... I know I can trust the ace to nail it.

64
00:04:42,366 --> 00:04:48,662
No matter what happens, even if it bounces off
a wall of blockers, I won't let it hit the floor.

65
00:04:49,961 --> 00:04:51,387
So don't change a thing.

66
00:04:52,193 --> 00:04:55,612
Ask me for the ball just one more time... Ace!

67
00:05:00,901 --> 00:05:02,114
Uh, hey!

68
00:05:02,797 --> 00:05:03,305
Hm?

69
00:05:03,616 --> 00:05:06,122
You're a libero... Um right, Nishiya?

70
00:05:06,191 --> 00:05:07,461
You're on the defense.

71
00:05:07,852 --> 00:05:11,090
It's Nishinoya... why do you think I'm a libero...

72
00:05:11,526 --> 00:05:12,649
Because I'm short?

73
00:05:12,805 --> 00:05:13,318
Huh?

74
00:05:13,591 --> 00:05:16,035
Course not. You're good at receives.

75
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:16,345
Hm?

76
00:05:17,285 --> 00:05:22,255
That's the right fit for the libero position because
solid receives are the backbone of the defense, right?

77
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,153
Look at you... you really know your stuff, huh?

78
00:05:25,957 --> 00:05:29,013
The captain says you're the guardian
of Karasuno or something like that!

79
00:05:29,109 --> 00:05:31,462
Huh?! Guardian, where'd that come from?!

80
00:05:31,566 --> 00:05:35,345
I-It's not like I'm that big of a deal.
That's kind of embarrassing, actually...

81
00:05:37,017 --> 00:05:38,350
He really said that?

82
00:05:38,513 --> 00:05:39,747
Mm-hm, Mm-hm, Mm-hm!

83
00:05:40,002 --> 00:05:43,321
Does he think giving me a badass
nickname is enough to make me come back?!

84
00:05:43,346 --> 00:05:44,927
I mean, he's not wrong, but...

85
00:05:44,952 --> 00:05:47,278
D-dammit, Daichi, that's not fair!

86
00:05:47,337 --> 00:05:50,131
I... still really suck at receiving...

87
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:52,895
And it's kinda the most important part of the game.

88
00:05:53,342 --> 00:05:54,018
Hm?

89
00:05:54,988 --> 00:05:57,285
Could you teach me... Nishi...

90
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:59,461
I mean, mister upperclassman!

91
00:06:03,545 --> 00:06:04,665
Uhhh...

92
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:06,110
Look.

93
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:11,623
After practice I'm gonna treat you to some ice cream!

94
00:06:11,887 --> 00:06:12,433
Huh?

95
00:06:12,599 --> 00:06:14,047
I'm your upperclassman.

96
00:06:15,261 --> 00:06:17,194
And that's what upperclassmen do!

97
00:06:18,371 --> 00:06:19,379
Does that mean...?

98
00:06:19,605 --> 00:06:24,265
That doesn't mean I'm gonna come back to volleyball club.
I'm just gonna teach you how to do receives, that's all!

99
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:25,164
Thank you!

100
00:06:29,675 --> 00:06:31,329
Okay, I'll show you again.

101
00:06:31,613 --> 00:06:32,125
Hm?

102
00:06:32,951 --> 00:06:33,590
Schwoom...

103
00:06:33,658 --> 00:06:34,615
Swish...

104
00:06:34,734 --> 00:06:35,642
And bam!

105
00:06:35,955 --> 00:06:36,643
You got it?

106
00:06:38,207 --> 00:06:38,849
Huh?

107
00:06:39,311 --> 00:06:40,025
I told you...

108
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:43,681
People who act on instinct really
suck at putting stuff into words.

109
00:06:43,743 --> 00:06:44,728
Oh I don't know...

110
00:06:44,753 --> 00:06:46,705
I'm pretty sure I understood what he meant.

111
00:06:46,826 --> 00:06:48,818
Yeah, that's 'cause you're the same way...

112
00:06:48,842 --> 00:06:52,527
It's all sound effects, it's
like... "whamajam!" and "kablooey!"

113
00:06:52,552 --> 00:06:54,739
Stuff, you're like a bunch of five-year-olds.

114
00:06:55,017 --> 00:06:55,535
Huh?

115
00:06:55,806 --> 00:06:57,132
A libero, huh?

116
00:06:57,157 --> 00:06:58,680
That's an interesting position.

117
00:06:58,957 --> 00:07:03,155
It is. The libero specializes in defense... A digger.

118
00:07:03,318 --> 00:07:05,637
They're not allowed to make serves or spikes.

119
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:09,941
Instead, they maintain the rearguard position
and keep the ball from hitting the floor.

120
00:07:10,136 --> 00:07:13,937
So I guess that's why you called
him the guardian... That's impressive!

121
00:07:14,067 --> 00:07:17,851
If we can convince him to come back,
I think the team'll be in great shape.

122
00:07:18,308 --> 00:07:21,378
He may be small, but he's got
a huge presence on the court.

123
00:07:21,403 --> 00:07:22,128
Tsukki is...

124
00:07:22,152 --> 00:07:22,481
What did I tell you?

125
00:07:22,506 --> 00:07:24,663
I'd feel a lot safer with him on our side.

126
00:07:25,371 --> 00:07:28,485
It's at least good to see Nishinoya
still hasn't lost his touch, isn't it?

127
00:07:28,716 --> 00:07:31,004
I heard he trained through his entire suspension...

128
00:07:31,348 --> 00:07:33,386
He was gettin' it on with the ladies' teams.

129
00:07:33,465 --> 00:07:35,778
Hahaha! Just like Hinata!

130
00:07:36,733 --> 00:07:38,460
Um hey, Nishinoya?

131
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:38,926
Huh?

132
00:07:39,402 --> 00:07:42,072
Who's that Asahi guy you were talking about before?

133
00:07:42,117 --> 00:07:44,811
Dude! That's the one thing you shouldn't say!

134
00:07:46,807 --> 00:07:49,593
He's Karasuno's ace... Well, s'posta be.

135
00:07:49,993 --> 00:07:50,997
The ace, huh?

136
00:07:51,553 --> 00:07:52,853
So, we do have one.

137
00:07:54,655 --> 00:07:56,403
What are you all speechless for?

138
00:07:56,868 --> 00:07:59,056
That's what... I wanna become!

139
00:07:59,682 --> 00:08:00,120
Huh?

140
00:08:00,984 --> 00:08:03,460
Really? A shorty like you?

141
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:03,971
Huh?

142
00:08:06,838 --> 00:08:08,289
I like your style!

143
00:08:08,901 --> 00:08:11,388
You wanna be the ace because it's flashy and cool, right?

144
00:08:11,418 --> 00:08:14,806
Hell yeah, buddy! You can be
the ace if you set your mind to it!

145
00:08:14,831 --> 00:08:19,323
To tell the truth, you're a lot more
promising than the guy we have! Haha...

146
00:08:19,702 --> 00:08:22,747
Of course... everybody out there wishes they were the ace.

147
00:08:22,825 --> 00:08:24,891
Yeah! That's 'cause the ace is the best!

148
00:08:25,081 --> 00:08:27,451
I mean even the word "ace" is awesome, right!

149
00:08:27,509 --> 00:08:30,551
"Setter" and "libero" sound
kinda plain and boring, you know?

150
00:08:31,682 --> 00:08:32,862
Just let it go...

151
00:08:33,431 --> 00:08:35,737
But still... there's one thing...

152
00:08:35,762 --> 00:08:38,400
That the crowd loves even more than a great spike.

153
00:08:41,533 --> 00:08:45,065
Make a wicked receive and they
go crazy for you every time!

154
00:08:46,723 --> 00:08:48,545
This game is "tall beats all"...

155
00:08:48,775 --> 00:08:53,089
So if you're a bit on the short side...
libero's one of the only options you got.

156
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:57,527
But I'll tell you one thing... I don't
play the position because of how tall I am.

157
00:08:57,706 --> 00:09:02,003
Even if I was 6 feet tall... I'd
still be out there digging the ball out.

158
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,080
Not being able to spike or block doesn't mean anything...

159
00:09:06,936 --> 00:09:10,188
In volleyball, you can never lose
unless the ball touches the floor.

160
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:14,745
And the only one who keeps it in the sky...

161
00:09:15,935 --> 00:09:16,678
is me!

162
00:09:17,128 --> 00:09:19,498
Whoa... amazing!

163
00:09:19,523 --> 00:09:23,326
Ah-hey, cut it out! You're making it
all weird when you freak out like that!

164
00:09:23,577 --> 00:09:26,340
Look I'll get you two ice
creams if you just chill, alright?!

165
00:09:26,366 --> 00:09:27,229
Okay!

166
00:09:27,429 --> 00:09:29,967
So, future ace, what's your specialty?

167
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:30,534
Huh?

168
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:34,792
Well uh, you said you were bad at
receiving... So, what's your thing?

169
00:09:35,357 --> 00:09:38,832
Well, it's not... I-I'm uh...

170
00:09:38,857 --> 00:09:40,411
Huh? Speak up.

171
00:09:40,951 --> 00:09:42,739
A... decoy.

172
00:09:43,422 --> 00:09:45,472
Why do you say it like it's something bad?

173
00:09:45,823 --> 00:09:50,988
Well, next to "ace" and "guardian" and all
that stuff... Decoy sounds kinda stupid, right?

174
00:09:51,013 --> 00:09:53,067
Who gives a damn what it sounds like?

175
00:09:53,408 --> 00:09:54,443
Yeah, but...

176
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:58,327
If having you as a decoy makes
it so a spiker can score a point...

177
00:09:59,782 --> 00:10:03,368
Then your job is important...
Just as important as theirs is!

178
00:10:04,426 --> 00:10:05,394
Okay...

179
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:09,723
Now maybe all those powerful spikes
we hit'll finally earn us some points...

180
00:10:09,748 --> 00:10:11,755
Since we've gotten ourselves a good decoy.

181
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:14,609
This Hinata-Kageyama combo should come in handy.

182
00:10:14,696 --> 00:10:15,324
Mm-hm.

183
00:10:16,417 --> 00:10:18,511
You do remember what Takeda told us, right...

184
00:10:18,638 --> 00:10:21,059
I think things really are gonna be changing for us.

185
00:10:21,667 --> 00:10:23,752
Let's just hope it's a good change.

186
00:10:24,715 --> 00:10:25,509
True that.

187
00:10:29,046 --> 00:10:31,040
I realize I'm asking a lot here.

188
00:10:31,206 --> 00:10:35,706
Look, I'll be the first to admit that I
don't know what I'm doing and I need your help.

189
00:10:36,158 --> 00:10:38,275
Those guys have so much potential.

190
00:10:38,822 --> 00:10:42,153
Can't you find it in your heart to help them out? Please.

191
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:48,097
You don't know when they quit, do you, Takeda?

192
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,803
No sir... it's my only real strength.

193
00:10:50,957 --> 00:10:53,880
Ask me all you want, and I'm still gonna tell you no.

194
00:10:54,596 --> 00:10:57,638
My grandpa was the super famous coach, not me...

195
00:10:57,885 --> 00:10:59,942
I told you, I'm not the coaching type.

196
00:11:01,844 --> 00:11:05,515
Listen, specs, I understand you
need somebody, but it just ain't me.

197
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:08,953
Honestly... I think the name's all you're after.

198
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,497
There is some truth to that...

199
00:11:12,528 --> 00:11:14,698
Coach Ukai was all we ever had...

200
00:11:14,857 --> 00:11:16,860
And I don't know who else to ask...

201
00:11:17,123 --> 00:11:21,642
But I am not the coach those guys
need... I can't even run a practice game.

202
00:11:22,547 --> 00:11:26,654
And you think a brand-name coach is all it
takes to fix that little problem of yours?

203
00:11:26,679 --> 00:11:28,636
All I ask... is you try.

204
00:11:28,661 --> 00:11:29,532
Forget it.

205
00:11:30,864 --> 00:11:33,157
I feel bad for you, pal, I really do...

206
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:38,207
But the last thing I need is a bunch of
pain-in-the-ass teenage athletes to look after, okay?

207
00:11:38,749 --> 00:11:40,020
I'll try again soon.

208
00:11:41,855 --> 00:11:42,998
Try again?!

209
00:11:43,056 --> 00:11:44,874
What's it gonna take to get rid of you?!

210
00:11:45,811 --> 00:11:47,551
I'm sorry to bother you, but...

211
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:53,231
If you would just come watch them play...
Then you'd see why it's so important.

212
00:11:54,082 --> 00:11:54,488
Guh...

213
00:11:56,492 --> 00:11:59,945
Yeah right! I mean it! You're not gonna change my mind!

214
00:12:00,078 --> 00:12:04,485
Tch! Just go awaay... Agh, jeez!

215
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,736
Here goes.

216
00:12:34,477 --> 00:12:37,525
Hey, Suga. Uh... it's been a while, hasn't it?

217
00:12:37,944 --> 00:12:41,464
Asahi... we would really like
you to come back to the team.

218
00:12:44,725 --> 00:12:46,988
Nishinoya just got back from suspension y'know.

219
00:12:47,223 --> 00:12:52,662
Really? Well that's good to hear. It makes me feel a
lot better knowing you guys have him there to back you up.

220
00:12:52,687 --> 00:12:54,527
That's how we feel about you!

221
00:12:55,017 --> 00:12:57,897
When you call for the ball,
everyone knows they're in good hands!

222
00:12:58,787 --> 00:13:04,235
Look I appreciate the thought... But if I were to join
the team, I would just hold you guys back like last time.

223
00:13:04,485 --> 00:13:05,270
Hear me out.

224
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:10,625
We've got this amazing decoy, and as much as I
hate to say it, the new first-year setter's great too!

225
00:13:11,776 --> 00:13:14,382
You wouldn't have to carry the
whole team on your own anymore!

226
00:13:14,901 --> 00:13:16,432
We've got some new tactics now...

227
00:13:16,663 --> 00:13:18,602
If we just had you and Nishinoya back...

228
00:13:18,658 --> 00:13:21,307
Then maybe Karasuno could be unstoppable again!

229
00:13:21,608 --> 00:13:24,613
Look we need our ace more than ever!
Things are just starting to get better-

230
00:13:24,638 --> 00:13:25,364
Asahi!

231
00:13:25,389 --> 00:13:25,895
Huh?

232
00:13:26,391 --> 00:13:27,843
It's time for career counseling!

233
00:13:29,097 --> 00:13:30,532
Sorry, I gotta go.

234
00:13:32,449 --> 00:13:33,091
Huh...

235
00:13:34,364 --> 00:13:35,609
You go in first...

236
00:13:35,752 --> 00:13:38,519
You're the one who wanted to see the ace so bad, remember?

237
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:41,108
B... But I'm way too scared to
walk into a third-year classroom!

238
00:13:41,133 --> 00:13:42,323
Please wait, Asahi!

239
00:13:42,371 --> 00:13:43,547
Uh Asahi?

240
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:44,460
Uh? What's up?

241
00:13:45,867 --> 00:13:48,076
Hey uh... What are you first-years doing over here?

242
00:13:48,101 --> 00:13:49,893
Uh, well we uh...

243
00:13:49,918 --> 00:13:52,098
Ah yes... Yes!

244
00:13:52,482 --> 00:13:53,639
Thank you so much!

245
00:13:53,993 --> 00:13:57,260
Oh no, pleasure's all mine! Yes... thank you!

246
00:14:00,364 --> 00:14:01,449
Alright!

247
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:07,023
That'll be perfect! Finally... Things are about to change!

248
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,171
Anyway... these are the new guys, Hinata and Kageyama.

249
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,348
Ah... It's uh nice to meet you guys.

250
00:14:14,373 --> 00:14:15,130
Hello!

251
00:14:15,926 --> 00:14:18,138
Wow, is he taller than Tsukishima?

252
00:14:18,207 --> 00:14:19,607
Four. Not the numbers we
wanted, but they're all promising.

253
00:14:19,632 --> 00:14:23,468
Either way, he's huge. So this is Karasuno's ace.

254
00:14:23,718 --> 00:14:24,896
Heh... is that right?

255
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:27,205
He seems nice though.

256
00:14:28,057 --> 00:14:29,699
Good luck. Alright kid...

257
00:14:29,724 --> 00:14:31,549
Are you gonna come play with us or what?

258
00:14:32,324 --> 00:14:34,109
I want to be the ace one day.

259
00:14:34,362 --> 00:14:36,057
I was hoping to see you in action!

260
00:14:37,687 --> 00:14:40,361
Hey Asahi! The teacher's waiting for ya man!

261
00:14:40,727 --> 00:14:43,515
Sorry... but I'm not the ace anymore alright?

262
00:14:47,872 --> 00:14:50,411
So uh... did he get hurt or something?

263
00:14:50,861 --> 00:14:53,200
Oh no... it's nothing like that at all.

264
00:14:54,104 --> 00:14:55,147
To be honest with you...

265
00:14:56,403 --> 00:14:58,824
It might just be that Asahi's lost his love for the game.

266
00:14:59,852 --> 00:15:03,710
What?! But why?! He's so big
and tall and he gets to be the ace!

267
00:15:04,874 --> 00:15:09,389
See... Asahi was Karasuno's biggest and strongest player.

268
00:15:10,945 --> 00:15:14,062
Even in the trickiest situations,
he could always score a point.

269
00:15:15,054 --> 00:15:18,239
That's why we all depended on him and
considered him the ace of the team...

270
00:15:18,896 --> 00:15:19,512
But then...

271
00:15:22,745 --> 00:15:23,826
Was it a bad game?

272
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:24,425
Huh?

273
00:15:25,405 --> 00:15:29,863
In one of our games... every single one
of Asahi's spikes was completely shut down.

274
00:15:31,201 --> 00:15:35,426
It was rough... and he's the type
who feels responsibility for everything.

275
00:15:39,719 --> 00:15:40,647
What's wrong with you?

276
00:15:40,953 --> 00:15:43,697
I don't think it's a good
enough reason to hate volleyball.

277
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,732
Well, I dunno... it could've been a number of things.

278
00:15:46,973 --> 00:15:48,393
Yeah like what else?

279
00:15:48,516 --> 00:15:49,960
Beats me. But hey...

280
00:15:50,462 --> 00:15:53,454
We don't actually know for sure
that he hates volleyball, do we?

281
00:15:53,709 --> 00:15:56,520
Ah? You're totally right!

282
00:15:57,463 --> 00:16:02,208
Rolliiiing... thunder!

283
00:16:02,727 --> 00:16:03,610
Huh...?

284
00:16:05,158 --> 00:16:07,528
Uh... well okay then.

285
00:16:07,553 --> 00:16:09,714
Come on, dude, it's just a rolling receive!

286
00:16:09,739 --> 00:16:11,119
What are you yelling for?

287
00:16:11,366 --> 00:16:12,669
Are you hearing yourself?

288
00:16:12,694 --> 00:16:15,574
You better watch your mouth, you little
first-year brats, or you're gonna regret it!-

289
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:17,484
I'll make you do laps! No, push-ups!

290
00:16:17,517 --> 00:16:19,168
You know what, whatever you hate the
most, I'm gonna make you do a thousand of!

291
00:16:19,192 --> 00:16:22,423
That was awesome! Teach me the rolling thunder too!

292
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:25,890
Take five, guys! Guess what? Great news!

293
00:16:26,999 --> 00:16:29,139
So, the golden week training camp.

294
00:16:29,518 --> 00:16:31,386
We're all going this year, aren't we?

295
00:16:31,716 --> 00:16:32,776
Training camp?

296
00:16:32,933 --> 00:16:36,063
Yeah... all of us can surely benefit from the practice.

297
00:16:36,372 --> 00:16:39,956
That's excellent... cause on the
last day of said training camp...

298
00:16:40,327 --> 00:16:42,310
I've arranged us a practice gaaaame!

299
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:43,542
Whoaaa!

300
00:16:43,567 --> 00:16:45,848
Wow, Take! You're really pulling your weight!

301
00:16:45,873 --> 00:16:46,979
Who are we gonna be playing?

302
00:16:47,743 --> 00:16:50,422
It's Nekoma High School... They're in Tokyo.

303
00:16:50,605 --> 00:16:52,488
People describe them as...

304
00:16:53,617 --> 00:16:54,678
Catlike.

305
00:16:55,769 --> 00:16:56,755
Catlike?

306
00:16:56,786 --> 00:16:59,217
Yeah, we actually know who those guys are...

307
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:02,871
Our old coach was rivals with their
coach. We used to play them all the time.

308
00:17:03,172 --> 00:17:04,184
Oh...

309
00:17:04,209 --> 00:17:06,057
Oh, that's right! They called it...

310
00:17:06,455 --> 00:17:09,606
"Cats and birds!"... the famous trashcan showdown!

311
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:12,794
I can't believe people actually came to see that.

312
00:17:13,117 --> 00:17:16,786
But wait... We haven't played
that school in a while... so why now?

313
00:17:16,811 --> 00:17:19,848
It's simple... but I'll explain all the details later.

314
00:17:19,942 --> 00:17:26,051
In short, I found out they were our adversary...
and then... I just had to stage a rematch.

315
00:17:27,889 --> 00:17:32,089
If we go up against Nekoma High... he'll change his tune.

316
00:17:34,223 --> 00:17:35,078
Ugh...

317
00:17:36,494 --> 00:17:38,758
Great! Looking forward to it then!

318
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:40,935
Let's make this practice game count guys!

319
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:41,667
Right!

320
00:17:42,718 --> 00:17:47,885
Tokyo, huh? Those little city boys...
They have no clue what they're in for!

321
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:49,168
Did you say "city boys"?

322
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:50,938
What's it to you, f-four-eyes?!

323
00:17:52,084 --> 00:17:52,925
Hey Daichi.

324
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:53,631
Hm?

325
00:17:54,438 --> 00:17:57,363
I'm sorry... but I can't go to the practice game.

326
00:17:58,238 --> 00:17:59,391
What're you talking about?

327
00:17:59,644 --> 00:18:00,882
Hey! I bet Tokyo schools are tough!

328
00:18:00,906 --> 00:18:06,001
Kageyama's a great guy, and even though the other
first-years are kinda rough, they're a fun group.

329
00:18:06,569 --> 00:18:07,921
I think with a little time...

330
00:18:08,715 --> 00:18:10,472
This team'll be something special.

331
00:18:11,603 --> 00:18:13,533
I want to play with you guys... But...

332
00:18:15,415 --> 00:18:18,895
But if I played in the game...
And we were to actually win...

333
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:23,326
Then well it would be like saying that
we don't need Asahi and I... I just can't.

334
00:18:24,896 --> 00:18:26,563
We've been teammates for so long.

335
00:18:27,673 --> 00:18:29,724
I'm sorry if I'm being selfish.

336
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:33,204
Look I get it... but I still
want you to come to the camp okay.

337
00:18:33,229 --> 00:18:34,294
Hm? You mean it?

338
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:37,797
Hey Noya! That thunder thing!
Will you show me how to do it?!

339
00:18:37,921 --> 00:18:38,489
Well then?

340
00:18:39,815 --> 00:18:40,275
Huh?

341
00:18:41,372 --> 00:18:41,897
Huh?

342
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,067
Have a good night!

343
00:18:45,195 --> 00:18:46,408
See ya!

344
00:18:47,567 --> 00:18:48,474
Ahhhh...

345
00:18:48,578 --> 00:18:51,960
Do you think if Asahi came back,
everything would work out for us?

346
00:18:52,053 --> 00:18:53,646
And what about Noya, huh?

347
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:55,124
I dunno.

348
00:18:55,415 --> 00:18:56,404
I don't get it...

349
00:18:56,636 --> 00:19:00,025
Sugawara said Asahi was the kind
of guy who feels responsible...

350
00:19:00,105 --> 00:19:02,163
But I think he might feel bad too.

351
00:19:03,562 --> 00:19:05,825
They both feel like what happened was their fault...

352
00:19:07,356 --> 00:19:09,393
But it's not like they can win alone.

353
00:19:09,595 --> 00:19:11,540
No way, you don't get to say that!

354
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:15,064
What happened to Kageyama's
favorite catchphrase, anyway huh?!

355
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:20,192
"Receives... And sets... And spikes... I'd rather
do everything in the whole game all by myself."

356
00:19:20,217 --> 00:19:22,438
Would you just freakin' drop it!

357
00:19:22,463 --> 00:19:24,157
"Look at me, I'm a dumb jerk..."

358
00:19:29,511 --> 00:19:31,017
We're all on the same side...

359
00:19:31,095 --> 00:19:32,772
So we should be acting like it.

360
00:19:32,797 --> 00:19:33,321
Huh?

361
00:19:34,134 --> 00:19:36,958
I just wish we got along better... don't you?

362
00:19:38,638 --> 00:19:39,154
Em.

363
00:19:46,749 --> 00:19:49,594
Yeah it's nice of you to think of me and everything.

364
00:19:49,815 --> 00:19:53,327
And I can tell it's important to
you, but I'm not really interested okay?

365
00:19:53,504 --> 00:19:57,697
Look! If you don't come back to volleyball
club, the upperclassmen are never gonna cheer up-

366
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:00,255
Do you ever shut up?

367
00:20:01,253 --> 00:20:03,679
You two are funny. But, listen to me.

368
00:20:03,704 --> 00:20:04,369
G-guh huh?

369
00:20:05,353 --> 00:20:06,365
I'm sorry but...

370
00:20:06,941 --> 00:20:14,185
I've just forgotten what it feels like... to send the ball
through a wall of blockers. It seems impossible to me now.

371
00:20:14,802 --> 00:20:17,444
I just know I'd fail... Again.

372
00:20:17,854 --> 00:20:21,954
Just thinking about it freaks me out
and it's just too much for me right now.

373
00:20:22,089 --> 00:20:24,808
Well, this might sound cocky coming from a first-year...

374
00:20:24,918 --> 00:20:27,226
But I still think it's important for me to say it.

375
00:20:27,251 --> 00:20:29,234
Whatever it is you can tell me okay.

376
00:20:29,909 --> 00:20:31,252
I know what you mean.

377
00:20:31,912 --> 00:20:37,375
I'm short and I don't have great technique, so
the blockers used to stop me all the time... but...

378
00:20:37,595 --> 00:20:41,389
Thanks to Kageyama's amazing
sets I can get past anybody now!

379
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,717
Hmm...

380
00:20:42,794 --> 00:20:47,638
The wall just fades away... and then the
view of the other side is totally clear!

381
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:49,277
The view...

382
00:20:50,861 --> 00:20:52,709
I think I understand what he's talking about.

383
00:20:53,002 --> 00:20:56,038
And once I reach the top of my
jump, the ball hits my hand...

384
00:20:56,269 --> 00:20:59,635
And when the weight of it,
sorta leaves a sting in my palm...

385
00:20:59,802 --> 00:21:00,966
I love that!

386
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,255
I know that feeling too.

387
00:21:05,433 --> 00:21:07,461
You know... I'm really jealous of you...

388
00:21:08,138 --> 00:21:12,287
The way things are... I don't have the
height to clear a wall... Or the power...

389
00:21:12,693 --> 00:21:17,654
But you've got both! Look I know you
might've had a rough time in the past...

390
00:21:17,961 --> 00:21:21,055
But you scored a lot more times
than you got blocked, right?

391
00:21:21,443 --> 00:21:24,609
I mean c'mon... that is why they call you the ace!

392
00:21:29,214 --> 00:21:31,645
Oh? Let's head back, Hinata...

393
00:21:33,247 --> 00:21:34,958
Hey... Dude we gotta go.

394
00:21:39,164 --> 00:21:40,013
Hey uh...

395
00:21:40,194 --> 00:21:40,636
Hm?

396
00:21:41,117 --> 00:21:43,445
It's impossible to win all by yourself...

397
00:21:43,685 --> 00:21:45,670
You need the help of your teammates.

398
00:21:46,066 --> 00:21:52,254
I'm still getting used to that idea myself, so I
can't really talk, but it's true... see you around.

399
00:22:01,108 --> 00:22:01,799
Ready to go?

400
00:22:01,934 --> 00:22:03,379
Yeah, wanna get some food?

401
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:07,234
Ah? Uh...

402
00:22:10,586 --> 00:22:12,653
Come on! Gimme another one!

403
00:22:12,987 --> 00:22:15,457
Alright, shut up, I get it! Ready?

404
00:22:15,482 --> 00:22:16,118
Yeah!

405
00:22:23,795 --> 00:22:27,086
And once I reach the top of my
jump... The ball hits my hand...

406
00:22:27,598 --> 00:22:31,010
And when the weight of it...
Sorta leaves a sting in my palm...

407
00:22:31,449 --> 00:22:32,781
I love that!

408
00:22:35,021 --> 00:22:35,800
I know...

409
00:22:38,935 --> 00:22:40,534
I know what he means.

410
00:24:13,951 --> 00:24:15,812
I hope Asahi comes back soon.

411
00:24:16,061 --> 00:24:17,391
He's got chin stubble.

412
00:24:17,444 --> 00:24:17,931
What?

413
00:24:18,048 --> 00:24:20,969
Maybe if I could grow stubble
like that, I'd be more like an ace!

414
00:24:21,095 --> 00:24:22,471
Do you think hair tonic would help?

415
00:24:22,668 --> 00:24:24,510
Who cares, dumbass?!

416
00:24:24,632 --> 00:24:27,515
Next time on Haikyu!! "A toss for the ace."
