1
00:00:05,694 --> 00:00:06,519
Check it out!

2
00:00:06,996 --> 00:00:09,575
I've got the pairings for the
Inter-High preliminaries right here!

3
00:00:09,646 --> 00:00:10,480
Cool!

4
00:00:10,527 --> 00:00:11,379
Sweet!

5
00:00:11,736 --> 00:00:13,230
So, who do we play first?

6
00:00:13,515 --> 00:00:14,913
Let me see...

7
00:00:15,318 --> 00:00:16,830
Tori... Torino?

8
00:00:16,855 --> 00:00:18,000
Torino? That's in England!

9
00:00:18,025 --> 00:00:20,692
Try Italy. And you're reading the Kanji wrong.

10
00:00:20,946 --> 00:00:21,922
Whatever, dude.

11
00:00:22,231 --> 00:00:24,607
Oh! Karasuno, I've heard of that school!

12
00:00:24,877 --> 00:00:26,826
Uh... if I remember...

13
00:00:27,397 --> 00:00:30,281
A lot of people call them like, the "wingless crows."

14
00:00:30,306 --> 00:00:32,409
Wow, that's a messed-up nickname, right?

15
00:00:32,434 --> 00:00:34,085
Their team used to be pretty good though, right?

16
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:34,400
I think so.

17
00:00:34,425 --> 00:00:36,333
I think they went to nationals one time.

18
00:00:36,796 --> 00:00:40,274
Yeah, well, but apparently they're
nothing to write home about these days.

19
00:00:40,578 --> 00:00:42,754
Oh! Hey, are you thinking what I'm thinking?

20
00:00:42,779 --> 00:00:44,510
We might actually win this game!

21
00:00:44,613 --> 00:00:46,852
We'll get past the first round for once!

22
00:00:46,877 --> 00:00:49,608
Not if you don't get off your butts and start practicing.

23
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:50,514
C-captain!

24
00:00:50,715 --> 00:00:52,112
Now go run some laps!

25
00:00:52,145 --> 00:00:53,876
Yes sir...

26
00:00:56,405 --> 00:00:57,008
You know...

27
00:00:57,254 --> 00:01:01,336
This guy I played volleyball with back in
middle school, ended up going to Karasuno High.

28
00:01:01,455 --> 00:01:04,157
Oh yeah? Well, that ought to be an interesting reunion...

29
00:01:04,182 --> 00:01:06,477
You know, I don't think we've ever played them before.

30
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:07,733
Yeah, that's right...

31
00:01:08,336 --> 00:01:12,682
He said that he saw Karasuno play in the Spring Nationals
on TV and couldn't get the place out of his head...

32
00:01:13,235 --> 00:01:16,975
But I'm sure living close to the school had
something to do with his decision too, though.

33
00:01:17,485 --> 00:01:18,518
Wonder how he's doing?

34
00:01:22,038 --> 00:01:23,340
Good old Daichi.

35
00:01:29,245 --> 00:01:31,627
Don't just stand there, follow through!

36
00:01:31,818 --> 00:01:32,586
Get it together!

37
00:01:32,611 --> 00:01:33,508
I'm sorry!

38
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:35,415
Go after every ball...

39
00:01:35,504 --> 00:01:37,989
As if it's the last the last piece of meat on earth!

40
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:41,175
Don't take a play off.

41
00:01:41,223 --> 00:01:44,662
If you do, that'll be the one
you cry about after the game's done!

42
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:51,551
First of all, you guys did a great
job playing against Nekoma today.

43
00:01:51,971 --> 00:01:57,143
Next order of business... The Inter-High
preliminaries start next month, June 2nd to be exact.

44
00:01:57,326 --> 00:02:00,845
There's no regional prelim here,
so it's straight to prefectural.

45
00:02:01,134 --> 00:02:05,916
Out of 60-some teams in the prefecture,
only one gets to advance to the nationals...

46
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:08,601
Lose one match and that's all she wrote.

47
00:02:09,403 --> 00:02:12,995
If you want revenge against Nekoma,
you have to get number 1 in Miyagi.

48
00:02:13,138 --> 00:02:14,617
Second place won't do.

49
00:02:15,418 --> 00:02:19,629
Well, that's assuming they can prove themselves
as the greatest high school team in all of Tokyo.

50
00:02:20,129 --> 00:02:22,028
I guarantee you they can do it, coach!

51
00:02:22,068 --> 00:02:23,647
Yeah! They're gonna make it!

52
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:28,591
I want... to challenge Nekoma again.

53
00:02:28,861 --> 00:02:29,845
One more time!

54
00:02:35,908 --> 00:02:38,226
You're ain't done, ginger! On your feet!

55
00:02:38,391 --> 00:02:39,934
Yes sir! Keep 'em coming!

56
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,159
Front!

57
00:02:41,379 --> 00:02:41,929
Hiya!

58
00:02:42,441 --> 00:02:43,185
Cover it!

59
00:02:48,492 --> 00:02:50,057
Dude, that's nuts!

60
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:50,920
Ah?

61
00:02:51,186 --> 00:02:52,773
It's like a whole page!

62
00:02:52,798 --> 00:02:53,345
Right?!

63
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:54,252
Let me see.

64
00:02:55,772 --> 00:02:56,423
Ah!

65
00:02:56,538 --> 00:02:58,216
What are you guys so excited about?

66
00:02:58,241 --> 00:02:58,756
Look.

67
00:03:01,003 --> 00:03:03,645
That's Ushiwaka from Shiratorizawa Academy.

68
00:03:03,827 --> 00:03:07,156
They named him one of the three
players to watch in this year's nationals.

69
00:03:08,272 --> 00:03:10,406
That's the school Kageyama didn't get into!

70
00:03:10,431 --> 00:03:11,644
Would you shut it?!

71
00:03:12,601 --> 00:03:13,480
What are you two losers laughing at?!

72
00:03:13,505 --> 00:03:15,300
So, who's Ushiwaka?

73
00:03:15,325 --> 00:03:16,961
You seriously don't know who that is?

74
00:03:16,986 --> 00:03:19,645
Of course not. He only cares about the tiny giant.

75
00:03:19,727 --> 00:03:21,518
Ushiwaka is his nickname.

76
00:03:21,698 --> 00:03:26,777
His real name is Wakatoshi Ushijima, and
he's the number one ace in the prefecture.

77
00:03:26,936 --> 00:03:31,094
Yeah, just look at him. Now that is
what an ace is supposed to look like.

78
00:03:33,352 --> 00:03:35,854
Whoa! H-hey why's everyone staring at me?!

79
00:03:36,303 --> 00:03:39,721
Is Ushiwaka the reason you wanted
to go to Shiratorizawa Academy?

80
00:03:39,746 --> 00:03:43,135
Let me guess, you wanted to march
right up to that legendary ace and go...

81
00:03:43,183 --> 00:03:46,428
"Move it, you clumsy dumbass!" Like you tell Hinata!

82
00:03:46,453 --> 00:03:47,642
Of course not!

83
00:03:48,101 --> 00:03:51,917
So we can't play Nekoma... Unless we defeat them first?

84
00:03:52,157 --> 00:03:53,239
Remember, boys...

85
00:03:53,788 --> 00:03:56,091
Shiratorizawa's not the only good team.

86
00:03:56,965 --> 00:03:59,077
They're the biggest threat based on last year though.

87
00:03:59,702 --> 00:04:01,479
Thank you for stating the obvious...

88
00:04:01,702 --> 00:04:03,734
But there's a whole lot more than just them.

89
00:04:06,205 --> 00:04:09,296
Wakutani South has great defense and solidarity.

90
00:04:11,559 --> 00:04:16,547
Date Tech's been called the "iron wall" because
their team has higher blocks than anyone else around.

91
00:04:16,726 --> 00:04:17,922
They're big guys.

92
00:04:18,766 --> 00:04:23,800
From what I understand, these guys beat us two to nothing
in the public prefectural tournament back in march.

93
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:24,350
Hm?

94
00:04:25,322 --> 00:04:26,004
Wait a minute.

95
00:04:26,647 --> 00:04:28,338
Why does that sound familiar?

96
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:34,232
In one of games... every single one
of Asahi's spikes was completely shut down.

97
00:04:35,225 --> 00:04:40,173
Was that the game Sugawara was telling us about
before Asahi decided to come back to the team?

98
00:04:40,489 --> 00:04:44,210
Date Tech's team has been top-four
material for a good long while, but...

99
00:04:44,527 --> 00:04:50,416
Last year, they only ranked in the top 16 after
losing in round 3 to Shiratorizawa, who won first place.

100
00:04:51,005 --> 00:04:52,722
That's why they're not seeded this year.

101
00:04:54,487 --> 00:04:59,003
So depending on how the brackets are laid out, we
could end up having to face them in the first round.

102
00:04:59,974 --> 00:05:02,510
The next team is... Oh that's right...

103
00:05:02,908 --> 00:05:05,792
I heard you guys played a
practice game with them not long ago.

104
00:05:05,817 --> 00:05:06,201
Ah!

105
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:11,487
Their captain possesses the most offensive power
on the team on top of being an excellent setter...

106
00:05:12,502 --> 00:05:15,484
He might even be the top overall
player in the whole prefecture.

107
00:05:17,464 --> 00:05:20,376
Aoba Johsai, led by Toru Oikawa.

108
00:05:20,604 --> 00:05:22,258
Oh yeah, the great king!

109
00:05:22,569 --> 00:05:23,208
Hur...

110
00:05:23,233 --> 00:05:25,280
They ranked in last year's top four too.

111
00:05:25,305 --> 00:05:25,772
Humph!

112
00:05:26,969 --> 00:05:29,075
Now last but definitely not least...

113
00:05:30,931 --> 00:05:35,376
Shiratorizawa, headed up by that famous ace, Ushiwaka.

114
00:05:36,215 --> 00:05:37,401
That's the short version.

115
00:05:37,733 --> 00:05:39,674
I'll give you more detailed info later.

116
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:43,360
Wow, coach Ukai's got his stuff together...

117
00:05:43,553 --> 00:05:47,333
You two smartasses wanna pay attention or
you wanna share your thoughts with the class?

118
00:05:48,606 --> 00:05:51,806
Anyway, those are the four teams
I think we need to look out for.

119
00:05:52,446 --> 00:05:56,941
That said, if you spend too much time staring at
the top, you'll get the rug pulled out from under you.

120
00:05:57,591 --> 00:06:02,372
Don't let yourselves make the mistake of thinking we're
the only team who's there to take the number one spot.

121
00:06:02,601 --> 00:06:03,485
We're not.

122
00:06:04,242 --> 00:06:06,822
Sure, we're going to be training our asses off,

123
00:06:06,894 --> 00:06:10,221
but remember all those other teams
will be training their asses off too...

124
00:06:10,499 --> 00:06:14,650
No matter who won last year and who
lost, everybody's aiming to win it all...

125
00:06:15,094 --> 00:06:16,338
Never forget that.

126
00:06:17,032 --> 00:06:17,949
One more thing.

127
00:06:18,257 --> 00:06:21,935
Don't let those bastards call us
the "wingless crows" ever again!

128
00:06:22,027 --> 00:06:22,785
Right!

129
00:06:23,575 --> 00:06:25,002
You all are still in here?!

130
00:06:25,543 --> 00:06:28,653
I'm so sorry I'm late, I-I got stuck in a meeting.

131
00:06:29,371 --> 00:06:30,014
Anyway...

132
00:06:30,929 --> 00:06:32,954
I've got the bracket for the preliminaries!

133
00:06:35,932 --> 00:06:41,033
If our team and Date Tech both clear the first
round, we'll be up against them in round two.

134
00:06:42,002 --> 00:06:44,148
We shouldn't get ahead of ourselves you guys.

135
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:47,683
Aoba Johsai's seeded in our block this year.

136
00:06:48,322 --> 00:06:49,581
That's not good.

137
00:06:49,869 --> 00:06:51,409
Ugh... come on!

138
00:06:51,512 --> 00:06:53,078
I don't like those odds...

139
00:06:53,512 --> 00:06:54,040
Hey!

140
00:06:55,545 --> 00:06:57,607
Did you already forget what I told you?

141
00:06:57,796 --> 00:06:59,323
If you focus on the top-

142
00:06:59,348 --> 00:07:00,426
Yes, we know, sir.

143
00:07:07,452 --> 00:07:08,644
Which school did you pick?

144
00:07:08,889 --> 00:07:09,749
Karasuno.

145
00:07:10,028 --> 00:07:11,003
Which one is that?

146
00:07:11,391 --> 00:07:13,205
You know, the one from Sring Nationals.

147
00:07:13,397 --> 00:07:14,260
Oh, nice.

148
00:07:14,285 --> 00:07:15,792
So uh where are you headed?

149
00:07:16,374 --> 00:07:17,926
I chose to go to Tokonami...

150
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:19,693
Sorry about that.

151
00:07:19,718 --> 00:07:20,314
It's cool.

152
00:07:20,946 --> 00:07:21,863
I dunno, dude...

153
00:07:22,449 --> 00:07:24,810
I guess if I keep playing volleyball in high school...

154
00:07:25,154 --> 00:07:25,867
You should!

155
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:27,805
Maybe we'll get to play against each other.

156
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:32,335
But, hey, make sure you're ready for my
team to wipe the floor with yours, alright?

157
00:07:39,574 --> 00:07:40,969
Go on and try it.

158
00:07:44,126 --> 00:07:47,207
C'mon, pick up the pace, dude, it's gettin' late!

159
00:07:47,436 --> 00:07:48,682
We'll stay focused...

160
00:07:49,736 --> 00:07:51,147
One game at a time!

161
00:08:09,732 --> 00:08:11,226
Um, hey, Daichi!

162
00:08:11,306 --> 00:08:13,608
Oh... hey there, Michimiya.

163
00:08:13,633 --> 00:08:18,262
I just thought you might want a copy of the
program for the pep rally... Volleyball's 5th.

164
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:18,946
Thanks a lot.

165
00:08:18,971 --> 00:08:21,141
So do you have a speech prepared for it?

166
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:22,567
Eh, not really.

167
00:08:23,095 --> 00:08:25,574
I can't believe the Inter-High tourney is so close.

168
00:08:25,646 --> 00:08:29,098
Am... I hear the boys are getting super psyched for that!

169
00:08:29,155 --> 00:08:33,409
What was the name of that other school you
guys used to play practice games wi-, ooh Sorry.

170
00:08:33,434 --> 00:08:34,276
Ah, Nekoma?

171
00:08:34,301 --> 00:08:36,747
That's the one... I heard you played them again.

172
00:08:36,772 --> 00:08:41,370
Yeah... So how's the girls' team? Being in separate
gyms keeps us pretty much out of touch with each other.

173
00:08:41,705 --> 00:08:44,064
Eh... everything's about the same as always.

174
00:08:44,797 --> 00:08:47,909
I can't get a lot of the girls
to come to morning practice...

175
00:08:48,114 --> 00:08:50,753
So I guess I'm not much of a captain, huh?

176
00:08:51,378 --> 00:08:54,859
Oh well, we'll probably lose in the first round anyway.

177
00:08:55,861 --> 00:08:56,640
Oops.

178
00:08:57,353 --> 00:09:00,590
Michimiya... you told me you were
going to win for sure this time.

179
00:09:00,784 --> 00:09:01,872
Ah um...

180
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:02,822
Remember...?

181
00:09:03,496 --> 00:09:09,518
It doesn't matter how strong or talented
your opponent is. You won't win unless you try.

182
00:09:10,665 --> 00:09:14,659
O-oh, I'm sorry! I'm sure you didn't
come here for me to lecture you...

183
00:09:14,684 --> 00:09:16,086
Sorry it's what I do.

184
00:09:16,111 --> 00:09:17,456
Awhhhhh!

185
00:09:18,861 --> 00:09:23,156
It's funny, that's exactly the same
lecture you gave me back in middle school.

186
00:09:24,611 --> 00:09:27,526
I got my butt kicked in a pre-tournament practice game...

187
00:09:28,002 --> 00:09:30,610
I was starting to give up on winning for real.

188
00:09:31,263 --> 00:09:33,573
Even if you're not confident that you can win...

189
00:09:33,598 --> 00:09:36,869
And even if everyone around
you says that it's impossible...

190
00:09:37,323 --> 00:09:38,482
No matter what...

191
00:09:38,808 --> 00:09:42,154
"Never say never... don't admit defeat 'til you've tried!"

192
00:09:42,726 --> 00:09:43,568
Remember?

193
00:09:44,609 --> 00:09:48,852
Sorry! I just have a habit of
chickening out right before a tournament!

194
00:09:49,804 --> 00:09:50,678
I hate it!

195
00:09:50,703 --> 00:09:52,681
I guess I shouldn't be telling you what to do.

196
00:09:52,988 --> 00:09:53,425
Am?

197
00:09:53,782 --> 00:09:59,319
But we are both captains... So I've always got
your back... Feel free to talk to me anytime, okay?

198
00:09:59,654 --> 00:10:00,043
Oh!

199
00:10:01,874 --> 00:10:03,494
You're so weird... ha!

200
00:10:06,361 --> 00:10:07,393
Okay! I'm good!

201
00:10:09,077 --> 00:10:11,446
See ya, Daichi. Thanks a lot!

202
00:10:20,586 --> 00:10:23,649
Listen carefully... My special protégé...

203
00:10:23,809 --> 00:10:28,272
I want to crush you fair and square at an
official game, where we both play the setter!

204
00:10:30,317 --> 00:10:31,380
What's his deal?

205
00:10:31,483 --> 00:10:32,493
Hell if I know.

206
00:10:49,403 --> 00:10:50,925
Hey, Asahi!

207
00:10:51,779 --> 00:10:53,246
Club! Time to go!

208
00:10:53,425 --> 00:10:54,611
That was kinda rude.

209
00:10:54,636 --> 00:10:56,200
Yeah, he's not a dumb dog.

210
00:10:57,711 --> 00:10:59,984
You don't have to do that every time, Nishinoya...

211
00:11:00,564 --> 00:11:01,930
I'm not gonna run away.

212
00:11:03,344 --> 00:11:05,823
I understand everyone's got my back.

213
00:11:10,521 --> 00:11:12,191
I will hold my head up high...

214
00:11:12,807 --> 00:11:15,667
And show everyone that I'm Karasuno's ace!

215
00:11:18,252 --> 00:11:18,947
Hinata!

216
00:11:19,905 --> 00:11:21,076
Oh Sugawara.

217
00:11:21,311 --> 00:11:23,604
Perfect timing... I have something for you.

218
00:11:24,312 --> 00:11:26,310
I made copies for all the first-years.

219
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:28,702
Signals.

220
00:11:29,702 --> 00:11:34,177
My technical skill's not as good as Kageyama's
is, so I can't always toss perfect sets...

221
00:11:34,573 --> 00:11:37,970
but hand signals might help us
communicate our next move during a game.

222
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:43,157
It might take some time but it'll
probably help for you to memorize all these.

223
00:11:43,479 --> 00:11:44,557
Are you kidding me?!

224
00:11:44,783 --> 00:11:47,259
This is gonna be so awesome. I can't wait!

225
00:11:47,604 --> 00:11:51,462
Great... I'm sure we'll have to work out
the kinks before we can use them in a game...

226
00:11:52,221 --> 00:11:54,069
So let's practice as much as we can.

227
00:11:54,341 --> 00:11:57,143
Sure! I promise I'll learn to hit any set!

228
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:59,481
Give me some time... I can master it!

229
00:12:11,373 --> 00:12:13,429
We use a triple front decoy...

230
00:12:14,126 --> 00:12:15,440
And a back attack.

231
00:12:15,465 --> 00:12:18,286
Keishin? Did you get any more mirin in stock yet?

232
00:12:18,706 --> 00:12:20,240
Be right with you-ahh...

233
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:25,158
Well don't just throw it on the floor, dear.

234
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:30,456
So uh what's the matter with you Tanaka?

235
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:32,133
The tournament's almost here.

236
00:12:32,158 --> 00:12:32,730
Yeah?

237
00:12:32,755 --> 00:12:36,870
And tournaments are supposed to be all dramatic
like we're marching into battle, you know what I mean?

238
00:12:36,895 --> 00:12:38,386
Uhh... sure.

239
00:12:38,489 --> 00:12:41,784
And the most important part of
that is having a cute girlfriend.

240
00:12:42,069 --> 00:12:44,321
Isn't your big sports thing is tomorrow.

241
00:12:44,481 --> 00:12:46,086
Yes, darling, it is.

242
00:12:46,111 --> 00:12:48,961
Isn't this the one you've been practicing so hard for?

243
00:12:49,007 --> 00:12:51,815
Yeah, baby, I can't thank you
enough for supporting my dream.

244
00:12:51,844 --> 00:12:53,434
Oh, I don't mind at all!

245
00:12:54,296 --> 00:12:57,120
Nothing makes me happier than watching you play, baby!

246
00:12:57,698 --> 00:12:58,669
Do you mean it?

247
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:03,927
I really wanted to do something for you
before the game... So I... um... made you this.

248
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:06,263
Is that a good luck charm?

249
00:13:06,557 --> 00:13:09,599
That's right... Do your best, okay?

250
00:13:10,181 --> 00:13:12,596
See, I want to be more fired up about the game...

251
00:13:12,973 --> 00:13:15,924
But first I need a girlfriend... one that's sexy!

252
00:13:16,414 --> 00:13:19,836
Keep the crazy talk to a minimum or
I'll tell the coach to give me your spot.

253
00:13:20,058 --> 00:13:20,519
Huh?!

254
00:13:25,601 --> 00:13:26,675
Nice kill!

255
00:13:26,903 --> 00:13:27,788
Excellent!

256
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:28,869
Hey man-bun.

257
00:13:29,012 --> 00:13:29,551
Sir!

258
00:13:29,854 --> 00:13:32,096
Would you say you're pretty decent at back attacks?

259
00:13:32,128 --> 00:13:32,778
Ar...

260
00:13:33,218 --> 00:13:33,762
Over here!

261
00:13:33,787 --> 00:13:34,513
Um?

262
00:13:34,798 --> 00:13:36,048
I want to try something.

263
00:13:38,241 --> 00:13:40,165
So do boys think you can handle that?

264
00:13:40,246 --> 00:13:42,399
Well first we need to find the right hitting height.

265
00:13:42,424 --> 00:13:43,733
That looks tricky.

266
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:47,555
We'll do our best. Thank you for your advice, coach.

267
00:13:48,724 --> 00:13:51,336
Hinata, keep diving in just like before!

268
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:52,211
Yes, sir!

269
00:13:54,935 --> 00:13:55,604
Keep it up!

270
00:13:55,906 --> 00:13:56,614
Right!

271
00:13:57,354 --> 00:13:59,330
Asahi, would you mind practicing with me a little more?

272
00:13:59,355 --> 00:14:01,950
You know... you're looking really tired lately, coach.

273
00:14:01,975 --> 00:14:06,496
Come to think of it, I noticed you've been
showing up right when our practice starts every day.

274
00:14:06,521 --> 00:14:08,226
Is everything going okay at your job?

275
00:14:09,031 --> 00:14:12,230
Mhmm... up until recently the
store was all I had going on.

276
00:14:13,049 --> 00:14:17,705
But now I've started tending crops in the early
morning hours, so I've had to work night shifts instead.

277
00:14:19,187 --> 00:14:23,036
I've been thinking maybe it's about time I
stopped relying so much on my folks, you know?

278
00:14:23,504 --> 00:14:26,868
Uh thank you so much! I owe you a nice bottle of sake!

279
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:27,740
Oh yeah?!

280
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:32,277
Wow, this is a lot of different
attack patterns to practice...

281
00:14:32,842 --> 00:14:34,382
Are you planning to use all of them?

282
00:14:34,911 --> 00:14:36,099
Well... that depends.

283
00:14:36,124 --> 00:14:36,572
Hah?

284
00:14:36,715 --> 00:14:39,884
It's important to make sure these guys
stay focused on the game in front of them.

285
00:14:40,746 --> 00:14:45,008
That's not to say it's a bad idea to go ahead
and prepare ourselves for all the other games, too.

286
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:46,297
Don't tell 'em I said that.

287
00:14:47,962 --> 00:14:49,320
Great job, Hinata! You did it!

288
00:14:49,345 --> 00:14:52,234
That Hinata-Sugawara quick attack's looking good!

289
00:14:52,756 --> 00:14:54,991
The way you did it that time felt perfect!

290
00:14:56,307 --> 00:14:57,034
Sweet!

291
00:14:57,495 --> 00:15:02,850
Hey Asahi! What did you think of that last one? Too high?
Too low? How was it? C'mon you can be honest with me!

292
00:15:03,121 --> 00:15:05,313
Ew, it was fine... Mhm... Good-

293
00:15:05,338 --> 00:15:09,525
Gr don't hold back! Whatever criticism
you have, I can handle it! Just tell me!

294
00:15:09,791 --> 00:15:14,316
Uhhh, huh... Okay, then, maybe aim it a little higher?

295
00:15:14,772 --> 00:15:17,238
You could try sending it a
little further from the net too.

296
00:15:17,263 --> 00:15:19,788
Right, thank you! 10 more tries!

297
00:15:20,528 --> 00:15:21,158
Not enough?

298
00:15:21,658 --> 00:15:25,316
The tournament's almost here. There's
no time to start changing things up.

299
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:27,871
Don't forget the timing we practiced.

300
00:15:28,276 --> 00:15:28,974
Right!

301
00:15:29,844 --> 00:15:32,732
Oh, okay I get it. You want
to practice another pattern now.

302
00:15:32,757 --> 00:15:34,796
Alright, let's go, it's getting late.

303
00:15:35,004 --> 00:15:35,949
Yes, sir!

304
00:15:36,741 --> 00:15:39,800
Haaaaa!

305
00:15:41,251 --> 00:15:45,243
Hey Kiyoko. Daichi's gonna
treat us to some food after this.

306
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:49,007
I'm sorry... I have something else to do.

307
00:15:49,266 --> 00:15:50,996
Oh, okay. See you.

308
00:15:51,363 --> 00:15:51,975
Goodnight.

309
00:15:55,194 --> 00:15:56,176
One for everybody.

310
00:15:56,201 --> 00:15:56,837
Thank you.

311
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:58,233
You're the best, captain!

312
00:15:58,258 --> 00:15:59,698
Yeah, thanks Daichi!

313
00:16:00,043 --> 00:16:01,913
Everybody eat up so we can go home.

314
00:16:04,668 --> 00:16:08,013
Hey Tsukishima, the captain bought
everybody a meat bun, you want one?

315
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,389
Sure, thank you.

316
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:11,796
Hey, did Tadashi leave already?

317
00:16:11,986 --> 00:16:14,633
He said there was somewhere
he needed to go on the way home.

318
00:16:17,862 --> 00:16:18,400
Um...

319
00:16:18,425 --> 00:16:21,404
Uh sorry, we're actually closed for the day. Ah?

320
00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:24,517
I'm Yamaguchi from the volleyball club.

321
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:27,679
Right! So that's where I know you from.

322
00:16:28,731 --> 00:16:31,707
Look... the jump float serve...

323
00:16:32,281 --> 00:16:34,067
Do you think you can teach me how to do it?

324
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:37,934
Oh, yeah...

325
00:16:38,015 --> 00:16:40,064
I used it when we played each other, didn't I?

326
00:16:41,931 --> 00:16:44,824
I would, but the prelims are
right around the corner aren't they?

327
00:16:45,132 --> 00:16:48,089
If you're wanting to learn before
then, I don't think you have enough time.

328
00:16:48,743 --> 00:16:49,806
You're probably right.

329
00:16:50,515 --> 00:16:52,713
Odds are I won't get to play in the game, anyway.

330
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:57,664
First-years don't usually have a chance to
play if there are third-years on the team...

331
00:16:59,002 --> 00:16:59,726
But still...

332
00:17:00,784 --> 00:17:05,590
Despite all that... I never want to be
the only first-year on the bench again!

333
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:06,947
Hm...

334
00:18:47,386 --> 00:18:49,743
I say we call it early and get some rest.

335
00:18:49,768 --> 00:18:50,552
Right!

336
00:18:50,804 --> 00:18:51,959
Okay... let's go home-

337
00:18:51,984 --> 00:18:53,578
W-wait, don't leave yet!

338
00:18:54,015 --> 00:18:57,097
We have one more comment. It's from Kiyoko.

339
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:58,147
Huh?

340
00:19:00,002 --> 00:19:03,175
I'm not very... good with words...

341
00:19:03,511 --> 00:19:04,961
So I kinda did something.

342
00:19:07,545 --> 00:19:08,778
If you please, Takeda.

343
00:19:09,577 --> 00:19:10,311
Of course.

344
00:19:10,773 --> 00:19:14,609
Ah! Wait, sir... please, let me take that up there.

345
00:19:14,634 --> 00:19:15,395
I got it.

346
00:19:15,777 --> 00:19:16,937
What is that thing?

347
00:19:21,049 --> 00:19:22,007
And, go!

348
00:19:27,149 --> 00:19:28,711
Whoa!

349
00:19:29,591 --> 00:19:30,618
We have a banner?

350
00:19:32,119 --> 00:19:35,003
I found it while I was cleaning
up, so I thought I'd wash it.

351
00:19:35,489 --> 00:19:37,444
Yeah! I'm fired up!

352
00:19:37,469 --> 00:19:40,150
You're awesome, Kiyoko! Thanks for everything!

353
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,153
We're ready now! Let's win this thing!

354
00:19:42,178 --> 00:19:42,675
Not yet...

355
00:19:42,699 --> 00:19:43,135
Huh?

356
00:19:43,424 --> 00:19:44,433
Listen guys...

357
00:19:45,961 --> 00:19:47,160
I think there's more.

358
00:19:47,224 --> 00:19:47,733
Huh?!

359
00:19:51,258 --> 00:19:51,935
You...

360
00:19:52,404 --> 00:19:53,080
Huh?

361
00:19:57,642 --> 00:19:58,767
You can do it.

362
00:20:17,653 --> 00:20:18,268
Uh...

363
00:20:18,293 --> 00:20:23,129
Kiyoko! She's never done anything like this before!

364
00:20:23,154 --> 00:20:25,773
I don't get it. Why are they so freaked out by this?

365
00:20:25,915 --> 00:20:27,930
Most of the time, you can't shut them up.

366
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,902
What the hell?! Calm down already!

367
00:20:32,699 --> 00:20:35,640
We can win! The first round is all ours!

368
00:20:35,665 --> 00:20:37,953
Yeah!

369
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:54,329
I'm the first one here!

370
00:21:03,072 --> 00:21:04,734
Hey, get back here, Kageyama!

371
00:21:09,808 --> 00:21:12,110
You like that? I beat you this time.

372
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:16,469
Now the scores, 31 - 30 with one tie.

373
00:21:19,965 --> 00:21:20,604
That's wrong.

374
00:21:20,629 --> 00:21:23,104
Hell no, it's not! I'm ahead of you!

375
00:21:23,352 --> 00:21:26,703
Yeah, you are... But that makes it 30 - 32.

376
00:21:27,063 --> 00:21:27,747
Huh?

377
00:21:30,687 --> 00:21:32,868
I lost to you this time last year, too.

378
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:39,900
You beat me bad.

379
00:21:46,843 --> 00:21:49,289
You might be the king who rules the court for now...

380
00:21:53,414 --> 00:21:54,512
But I'm gonna win!

381
00:21:55,217 --> 00:21:57,591
One day I'll stay in the court longer than you!

382
00:22:00,679 --> 00:22:01,616
Listen to me.

383
00:22:02,606 --> 00:22:07,435
I'll beat you! If it takes 10
or even 20 more years, I will!

384
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:13,525
Wait a second... you think one
day, your dumb ass'll be on my level?

385
00:22:13,549 --> 00:22:14,007
Hm?

386
00:22:16,419 --> 00:22:18,134
Yeah... that's right!

387
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:21,403
Even the best in all of Japan? And the world?

388
00:22:21,428 --> 00:22:22,454
The world?!

389
00:22:25,236 --> 00:22:27,197
U-um... obviously!

390
00:22:29,147 --> 00:22:31,654
And I told you, not to call me the king.

391
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:35,202
Let's go.

392
00:22:35,561 --> 00:22:37,369
The real journey begins today.

393
00:22:37,394 --> 00:22:37,905
Hm...

394
00:22:39,712 --> 00:22:40,339
Yeah!

395
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:17,154
Ah... Tanaka, why are you still crying?

396
00:24:17,178 --> 00:24:19,207
Kiyoko said it's okay to cry!

397
00:24:19,232 --> 00:24:21,089
Yeah... but that was yesterday.

398
00:24:21,113 --> 00:24:23,130
Dammit, don't make me relive it!

399
00:24:23,155 --> 00:24:25,162
Ugh. You guys are pathetic.

400
00:24:25,509 --> 00:24:27,857
Next Haikyu!! "We're back."
