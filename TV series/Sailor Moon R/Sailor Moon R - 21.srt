But since that dinosaur is just
<i>so cute, he better...</i>

6
00:02:12,235 --> 00:02:15,302
Come and play with Sailor Moon!

7

So did you two finish your
summer break homework yet?

8
00:02:23,669 --> 00:02:25,002
Not yet...

9
00:02:26,202 --> 00:02:28,169
Hey, we should plan a summer get
away and go somewhere fun!

10
00:02:28,202 --> 00:02:32,035
Yeah we should. A summer
vacation somewhere else would be
great...

11
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:34,635
Somewhere where we could
cool off and relax.

12
00:02:34,669 --> 00:02:37,069
With no homework
and no stairs.

Oh look! It's Chibi-Usa!

16
00:02:51,135 --> 00:02:53,569
So did you come up here to cool
off as well?

17
00:02:54,302 --> 00:02:56,702
Yeah, but if you're looking
for Rei, she left town.

18
00:02:56,735 --> 00:02:58,035
[All] Huh!

19
00:02:58,069 --> 00:02:59,435
Well then where did she go?

20
00:03:00,835 --> 00:03:03,002
I came all the way up here to
play with her because I was
bored.

21
00:03:03,035 --> 00:03:05,469
But she's doing spiritual
training on a remote island.

22
00:03:05,669 --> 00:03:08,169
Wait! She's gone away to a
remote island?!

23
00:03:09,102 --> 00:03:14,602
So then, she's there, all alone
on a private beach, enjoying a
vacation?!

24
00:03:14,635 --> 00:03:16,402
<i>How could Rei do that to us!?</i>

25
00:03:19,535 --> 00:03:23,435
Chibi-Usa! Did Rei happen to
tell you where that remote
island is?

26
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:24,935
Uh-huh.

27
00:03:26,135 --> 00:03:28,135
Well in that case I say we all
join her there right away!

28
00:03:29,735 --> 00:03:32,302
It would be wrong to let Rei
keep all the summer fun to
herself, right girls?

29
00:03:32,335 --> 00:03:33,002

we didn't come here to relax.
We came because Chibi-Usa said
she was missing you.

Oh Chibi-Usa is that true?

She told all of us she wants
you to play with her, huh!

today, right?

[Muffled] Okay!

57
00:05:20,769 --> 00:05:24,069
I can understand Chibi-Usa
missing me, but why did all of
you have to come with her?

58
00:05:24,702 --> 00:05:28,469
You didn't come to keep me from
doing my spiritual training, did
you?

59
00:05:29,502 --> 00:05:32,402
[Both] Ohh, right. You're
spiritual training.

60
00:05:32,969 --> 00:05:37,502
I read somewhere that ocean
swimming is one of the best ways
to build one's spiritual
strength.

I just don't really like eating

worry, I'll stay here with you.

154
00:11:18,702 --> 00:11:22,469
My name's Usagi. But
everyone calls me Chibi-Usa.

155
00:11:22,702 --> 00:11:25,202
[Giggles] And you are?

156
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:30,035

so you don't have a name yet, do
<i>you?</i>

157
00:11:30,369 --> 00:11:35,369
Okay, with that long neck of
yours, I'll call you "Giraffe!"

158
00:11:35,735 --> 00:11:37,935
[Giggling] That'll be your name!

Hello Giraffe! Let's
be friends forever! [Happy

[Sigh] Could it be sharks
really did eat her after all?

161
00:11:48,569 --> 00:11:53,102
You need to quit that negative
thinking! Chibi-Usa's still very
alive.

162
00:11:53,535 --> 00:11:55,135
I sense her energy.

163
00:11:56,635 --> 00:11:59,169
We're gonna find her. Look at
Luna and Artemis, they haven't
given up.

164
00:11:59,602 --> 00:12:02,235
Look at how intensely they're
searching for her.

But now that you and I have

Could it be Chibi-Usa built a
fire to try to signal us?

179
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:23,458
No, that's volcanic smoke.

00:13:58,124 --> 00:14:00,224
Being seasick has you
hearing things, Luna.

188
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:06,458
Artemis, you saw that?

189
