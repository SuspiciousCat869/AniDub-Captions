We're really sorry,
Chibi-Usa...

00:02:35,712 --> 00:02:40,312
Oh! Uh... You
look serious.
What's wrong?

16
00:02:40,346 --> 00:02:42,746
Nothing now!
You're the solution!

That's right! Usagi
can go with you!

Hm?

19
00:02:47,679 --> 00:02:51,712
You see, tomorrow there's
a parent-child curry rice
event that Chibi-Usa's
school is hosting...

20
00:02:51,746 --> 00:02:54,512
...and we had
promised that we would
both go to it with her.

21
00:02:54,546 --> 00:02:58,046
But, now we can't.
Something urgent came up
that we must attend to.

22
00:02:58,079 --> 00:03:03,646
So you want reliable and
responsible little 'ol me to
take over and go to the event
in your place, is that it?

23
00:03:03,679 --> 00:03:05,446
No way!

Hm!?

25
00:03:07,012 --> 00:03:10,846
I'd rather have nobody
go along with me, if my
only choice is <i>you</i> !

26
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:14,412
Well, do you think I like
being stuck babysitting a
spoiled kid like you!?

27
00:03:14,446 --> 00:03:17,312
I have far better
things to do! Hmph!

don't go with me..
they're not my parents.

just fine on my

out there passing by!

laughing together now.

I'm saying you're
wrong, Usagi.

Why am <i>I</i> wrong?
She's the one who
started it by
insulting <i>me!</i>

You still don't
get it, do you?

00:04:12,712 --> 00:04:14,612
Huh?

41
00:04:14,646 --> 00:04:18,079
Chibi-Usa is a little
child, while you're a middle
schooler so it's up to you
to act more adult like.

42
00:04:18,112 --> 00:04:22,946
And, she's separated from her
parents, which probably makes
her sad, while you are with
yours all the time!

43
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:23,646
And furthermore...

44
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:25,779
I've heard enough
already!

Hm! I know..!

You're starting
to get it..?

get some crackers!

I can do plenty of

[sob] I can't do
this! I just can't!

57
00:05:06,779 --> 00:05:09,946
Chibi-Usa, what exactly
are you trying to do?

58
00:05:09,979 --> 00:05:13,912
Huh..? What does it
look like? Can't
you tell..?

59
00:05:13,946 --> 00:05:16,812
I'm practicing my
skills on how to
make curry rice!

60
00:05:16,846 --> 00:05:20,912
I know! Why don't we
go pay Mamo a visit
and ask for his help?

61
00:05:20,946 --> 00:05:22,879
Huh?

62
00:05:22,912 --> 00:05:26,979
We could invite him to
come to your class curry
party! The three of us.

63
00:05:27,012 --> 00:05:28,512
Would that be
okay with you?

64
00:05:28,546 --> 00:05:30,612
Do you think
he'll say yes?

65
00:05:30,646 --> 00:05:32,212
It's cool if you
don't wanna come...

66
00:05:32,246 --> 00:05:35,546
I'll just go to his
house by myself and
the two of us will
figure it out alone.

67
00:05:35,579 --> 00:05:38,679
I think you're just
using me as an
excuse to go there!

68
00:05:38,712 --> 00:05:41,812
Of course not! Would
I do something like that?!
Well, maybe a little bit.

69
00:05:41,846 --> 00:05:42,779
Yeah...

70
00:05:47,579 --> 00:05:49,579
Uh, hi there.

71
00:05:49,612 --> 00:05:52,079
It's too early
for unexpected
visitors.

72
00:05:52,112 --> 00:05:54,746
Wait a minute! It
won't take too long!

73
00:05:54,779 --> 00:05:56,512
I'm not really
awake yet.

74
00:05:56,546 --> 00:05:59,079
Mamo! I have
a favor to
ask of you!

75
00:05:59,112 --> 00:06:01,612
Chibi-Usa? You're
here as well?

76
00:06:01,646 --> 00:06:02,712
Come in...

77
00:06:04,679 --> 00:06:09,079
And that's why we're hoping
you can come with us to
Chibi-Usa's school class
curry party tomorrow.

78
00:06:09,112 --> 00:06:12,546
It' very short
notice. I'm supposed
to work tomorrow...

79
00:06:12,579 --> 00:06:14,512
I was sorta
counting on you.

80
00:06:14,546 --> 00:06:16,979
It's okay...
I'm really
sorry, Mamo...

81
00:06:17,012 --> 00:06:20,046
It's so last minute.
It's too much to ask.

82
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:23,379
It was just a crazy idea
that Usagi came up with.

83
00:06:23,779 --> 00:06:25,079
We never should have
bothered you....

84
00:06:25,112 --> 00:06:27,812
It's alright. I
think I can get
out of work.

85
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:30,979
But I'm warning you,
I don't know anything
about making curry rice.

86
00:06:31,012 --> 00:06:33,812
Oh, don't worry
about that! Usagi
can make it!

87
00:06:33,846 --> 00:06:37,379
[birds chirp]

88
00:06:37,412 --> 00:06:39,079
Well, I may be
wrong about that.

89
00:06:39,112 --> 00:06:43,012
Heh! Give me a little
more credit! I'll figure
out how to make an
authentic curry rice!

90
00:06:43,046 --> 00:06:46,679
Don't worry! Chef
Usagi has everything
under control!

91
00:06:46,712 --> 00:06:50,579
Now I'm starting to
worry a little bit.
Maybe we should make
a test batch...

92
00:06:50,612 --> 00:06:51,812
I'll help if
I can...

93
00:06:51,846 --> 00:06:53,779
Thanks, Mamo!

[groan]

96
00:06:56,046 --> 00:06:57,412
Then let's go!

97
00:06:57,446 --> 00:06:58,379
Huh?!

98
00:06:58,412 --> 00:06:59,646
We have to go
buy all the
ingredients!

99
00:06:59,679 --> 00:07:02,512
Ah! It's probably too
short notice for you,
right, Mamo?

100
00:07:02,546 --> 00:07:04,912
Why don't we go in
the evening? The
evening would be better.

101
00:07:04,946 --> 00:07:06,912
No, I can go now.
I don't mind.

102
00:07:06,946 --> 00:07:10,579
Actually, now's not so
good, I need a little
time for the prep work.

103
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:23,379
Calaveras, what
are you doing?

104
00:07:23,412 --> 00:07:27,879
I heard that this is how
earthlings care for their
complexion in this climate.

105
00:07:27,912 --> 00:07:29,946
Which can produce
wrinkles over time.

106
00:07:29,979 --> 00:07:34,546
You oughta try it, sister.
It'll make your skin silky
smooth and appealing.

107
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:39,779
Hmph! If you mean appealing
to a man who judges a woman
solely on her appearance,
it isn't worth it.

108
00:07:39,812 --> 00:07:43,446
In this world, it doesn't
hurt to be beautiful, and I
hate to have to tell you...

109
00:07:43,479 --> 00:07:49,412
...but it's really kind of
sad to stand here and see a
woman stuffing her face with
cake because a man dumped her

110
00:07:49,446 --> 00:07:51,446
Ugh! Why you!

111
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:53,746
Nice to see you
two getting along
so well...

[gasp] Master Rubeus!

113
00:07:56,046 --> 00:07:58,912
I have located our
next Crystal Point
target...

114
00:07:58,946 --> 00:08:01,379
Where exactly is it?

115
00:08:11,612 --> 00:08:13,279
<i>(Rubeus)</i>
<i>Right there...</i>

116
00:08:13,746 --> 00:08:14,779
I'll handle it.

117
00:08:14,812 --> 00:08:17,812
Np. Master Rubeus.
Allow me.

118
00:08:17,846 --> 00:08:20,479
[gasp]
Come back here!
That's not fair!

119
00:08:24,746 --> 00:08:29,479
It says 30 to 40 spices
have been blended together
to create the curry powder.

120
00:08:29,512 --> 00:08:33,079
...you add a hint of
cinnamon, nutmeg, clove,
ginger, and cumin...

121
00:08:33,112 --> 00:08:35,679
I don't need a list
of spices, I need a
cook book!

Here you go, Usagi.

123
00:08:37,046 --> 00:08:39,912
It's called "Hi
Curry." I highly
recommend it.

...Peel the carrots,
onions, and potatoes
ahead of time...

00:08:45,612 --> 00:08:48,679
Then dice the
vegetables.

128
00:08:48,712 --> 00:08:49,912
You're fast!

129
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:51,846
I want a turn!
Let me!

130
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:53,512
Be careful not to
cut yourself...

131
00:08:53,546 --> 00:08:55,879
I'm not so sure about
your dicing skills...

132
00:08:56,879 --> 00:08:59,079
It's fine, as long
as I'm having fun!

Ahhhhh! Call and

137
00:09:11,712 --> 00:09:14,379
Remain calm! Get
a hold of yourself!

138
00:09:14,412 --> 00:09:15,379
What happened!?

139
00:09:15,412 --> 00:09:17,312
Ami! Call an
ambulance...
an ambulance!!!

140
00:09:17,346 --> 00:09:18,846
They'll have to
re-attach it...

What? Wait a minute!
This is a carrot stub!

142

Are you bleeding?

143
00:09:24,012 --> 00:09:25,979
Maybe just a
little...

sample a rare dark
fruit that has a
very tasty flavor?

178

Are you feeling anxious
about your life? Things
aren't working out too

Then you should know, black
is for you! So, come on over

to keep your unhappiness alive

Hi! Welcome everybody
in the Juban Supermarket!

185
00:11:50,446 --> 00:11:53,846
Today I'd like to
introduce a wonderful
fruit! You see?

186
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:57,946
There's some black on the
outside just like this year's
trending color, which is
also black!

187
00:11:57,979 --> 00:12:00,812
And the flavor is
is as outstanding
as our half-price
sale!

Step up, please,
and try a free
sample!

Oh no, I don't
do this!

193
00:12:11,479 --> 00:12:16,412
Men love to submit to cute women
like me, so, I really don't have
to do anything at all, except
look pretty!

00:12:16,446 --> 00:12:19,646
Eventually, that won't
work, ya know...

and try it.

tasted Dark Power
fruit before...

Once we've finished
contaminating this store with
Dark Power, the Crystal Point
will be totally destroyed.

199
00:12:41,712 --> 00:12:45,846
Okay, those who have
tried the fruit, please
go ahead and continue
with your shopping.

200
00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:50,579
Remember, touching
everything before you
buy is what a smart
shopper does...

cats can't come in.

Yup, you're right, but that's
weird... the Juban Supermarket
has always been known for its
fresh food!

217
00:14:15,921 --> 00:14:21,055
Well it sure isn't fresh today.
We're not buying any of
Chibi-Usa's ingredients in a
place that smells this bad!

218
00:14:21,088 --> 00:14:22,888
Right! C'mon.
Let's go.

gonna wait for me!?

different cuts of
meat, I don't know
which one to choose!

Oh, hi Chibi-Usa.
Where's Usagi? I
thought you 2 were
going shopping together.

Usagi...

Usagi's trying to help..
in her own way.. so cut
her some slack!

231
00:14:49,488 --> 00:14:52,421
Hey, wait a minute!
Do you know how to
make curry, Rei?

232
00:14:52,455 --> 00:14:54,321
You name it, I
can make it in
a flash!

233
00:14:54,355 --> 00:15:00,188
There's Indian, Sri Lankan,
and all your local neighbor-
hood curry shop varieties
to choose from!

234
00:15:00,488 --> 00:15:03,955
Oh wow! You're just like
those heat-and-serve
curry commercials...

235

Can you please come
with me to my school
tomorrow!?

Hm?

party at Chibi-Usa's
school...

made plans to go, and
it was just going to
be the three of you.

Do you have something
you need to do tomorrow?

240

Well, not exactly, but
I don't know if I should.

I don't need to go.

come, too, Mamo.

are we supposed to
make the curry rice now!?
