1
00:01:57,646 --> 00:02:03,846
Under the spotlight, I
finally get to dance with
my Prince Charming! I am
the heroine of this story!

2
00:02:03,879 --> 00:02:11,113
What?! Natsumi's the
heroine?! Agh! And now
there's a Cardian running
amuck?! That's it! If anyone

3
00:02:11,146 --> 00:02:15,879
interrupts our play...
In the name of the moon,
I'll punish you!

4
00:02:21,113 --> 00:02:24,746
Well what do we have
here? You're studying
on your own?!

5
00:02:25,579 --> 00:02:28,046
Hello? Usagi?

6
00:02:28,946 --> 00:02:30,546
[snoring]

7
00:02:30,579 --> 00:02:32,646
Same as always...

8
00:02:32,679 --> 00:02:33,846
Huh?

9
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:37,046
I wonder if this story
is making her have
romantic dreams...

10
00:02:37,079 --> 00:02:43,979
You know, some day, I hope
and I dream that I will
share a passionate kiss
with a wonderful male cat!

11
00:02:44,013 --> 00:02:46,013
[kissing noises]

12
00:02:46,446 --> 00:02:47,479
[falling grunts]

13
00:02:48,846 --> 00:02:52,879
Aw! I was having this
great dream about eating
a huge meat bun! Luna!

14
00:02:52,913 --> 00:02:56,046
<i>Huh?! A meat bun?!</i>

15
00:02:56,613 --> 00:02:59,713
<i>Where did the girl with</i>
<i>romantic dreams go?!</i>

16
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:08,779
<i>"Steal a Kiss from Mamoru:</i>
<i>An's Project Snow White"</i>

17
00:03:15,713 --> 00:03:19,446
Is this necessary? Do
we really need to study
English?

18
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:23,713
If we have time for that,
shouldn't we be thinking
up ways to gather energy
instead?

19
00:03:24,446 --> 00:03:25,579
Ugh!

20
00:03:28,013 --> 00:03:29,013
[gasp]

21
00:03:29,046 --> 00:03:30,413
[giggling]

22
00:03:32,213 --> 00:03:35,946
Love is something that
you have to reach out
and take! Like kissing a
girl in a deep sleep to

23
00:03:35,979 --> 00:03:38,746
capture her love.
That's it!

24
00:03:39,279 --> 00:03:45,746
I will win Mamoru's heart
by stealing a kiss from
him.

25
00:03:47,779 --> 00:03:48,546
[sigh]

26
00:03:48,579 --> 00:03:50,379
Sorry I'm late!

27
00:03:50,913 --> 00:03:53,679
That's okay. We're
used to it by now!

28
00:03:53,713 --> 00:03:57,913
Eh... But, Rei, why did
you call this meeting
on such short notice?

29
00:03:57,946 --> 00:03:59,846
There another Cardian
running loose?

30
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:04,546
No, that's not the
reason. Actually,
Mamoru is the one
who's in trouble.

31
00:04:04,579 --> 00:04:08,746
No way! Mamoru?! Oh,
no! Is he seriously
injured?

32
00:04:08,779 --> 00:04:11,346
Poor Mamoru!
That's so awful!

33
00:04:11,379 --> 00:04:12,946
[crying]

34
00:04:12,979 --> 00:04:15,413
Agh! That's not it!

35
00:04:15,446 --> 00:04:20,813
Relax, Usagi. Mamoru is
merely supposed to appear
in a play at Juban Hall,
that's all.

36
00:04:20,846 --> 00:04:22,746
What? A play?

37
00:04:22,779 --> 00:04:26,846
Yeah, that's right. I
guess some of Mamoru's
friends were supposed to
be in the play along with

38
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:28,613
him, but they dropped
out.

39
00:04:28,646 --> 00:04:32,246
<i>They got into an argument</i>
<i>about casting, and their</i>
<i>troupe disbanded.</i>

40
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:37,346
He's having a hard time
finding new people to take
on the roles in the play.
He's really worried.

41
00:04:37,379 --> 00:04:41,813
You know how responsible
a person Mamoru is. He
doesn't want to cancel
the play.

42
00:04:41,846 --> 00:04:44,413
Earlier he left this
prayer at the shrine.

43
00:04:45,446 --> 00:04:46,346
Ahhh!

44
00:04:46,379 --> 00:04:49,246
In that case, we
better go give him
a hand!

45
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,313
Meow!

46
00:04:51,546 --> 00:04:53,413
You're telling me that
you all want to have
parts in the play?

47
00:04:53,446 --> 00:04:57,713
Yeah, that's right! Rei
came up with the idea. We
thought that all of us
could put up a performance

48
00:04:57,746 --> 00:04:58,946
of Snow White!

49
00:04:58,979 --> 00:05:00,846
Snow white, huh?

50
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:04,279
And, and, and! I think
I should get the role
of Snow White because

51
00:05:04,313 --> 00:05:06,379
it was my idea in
the first place

52
00:05:06,813 --> 00:05:09,279
What?! Get real!
That's not fair!

53
00:05:09,313 --> 00:05:12,446
I should be Snow White
because I'm just so
cute and adorable!

54
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,246
Uh...

55
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:17,813
Hold on, you don't get
to make the decision!
I should be the one who
gets to play Snow White.

56
00:05:17,846 --> 00:05:20,813
After all, I do have
the biggest boobs out
of all of you.

57
00:05:20,846 --> 00:05:22,746
Are you out of
your mind!

58
00:05:22,779 --> 00:05:25,113
Hmph! Wanna take
measurements?

59
00:05:25,413 --> 00:05:27,179
Wait a second!

60
00:05:27,213 --> 00:05:30,646
I think that I would be
the better choice for
Snow White since I'm
the most like her...

61
00:05:30,679 --> 00:05:32,413
...elegant and
graceful!

62
00:05:32,446 --> 00:05:33,979
Ugh!

63
00:05:34,013 --> 00:05:37,879
I'm busy with cram
school and homework,
but maybe I can help
out. Snow White only

64
00:05:37,913 --> 00:05:42,913
has a few lines because
she's fast asleep almost
the entire time! So I
could play her!

65
00:05:42,946 --> 00:05:44,579
[annoyed grunts]

66
00:05:44,613 --> 00:05:45,313
Hmph!

67
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:51,146
Uh, you know there are
still a lot of other
characters to play,
too. There's the prince

68
00:05:51,179 --> 00:05:53,079
and the evil queen...

69
00:05:53,113 --> 00:05:56,579
At least choosing the
prince should be pretty
easy! All of us think that
you should play him, Mamoru!

70
00:05:56,613 --> 00:05:59,379
So the only real problem
is, who's gonna play
Snow White?!

71
00:05:59,413 --> 00:06:00,813
Yeah! Me!

72
00:06:00,846 --> 00:06:03,546
I came up with the
idea, so it should
be me!

73
00:06:03,579 --> 00:06:05,646
Yes, but I have
the best figure.

74
00:06:05,679 --> 00:06:06,713
<i>I'll do it!</i>

75
00:06:06,746 --> 00:06:08,746
I have elegance!

76
00:06:08,779 --> 00:06:11,846
I'll study the part
really well! Pretty
please?

77
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:12,546
It's mine!

78
00:06:12,579 --> 00:06:13,146
No, mine!

79
00:06:13,179 --> 00:06:13,680
No, mine!

80
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,179
No, mine!

81
00:06:14,213 --> 00:06:14,813
I'll do it!

82
00:06:14,846 --> 00:06:16,146
[arguing]

83
00:06:16,179 --> 00:06:17,646
You're all acting
so conceited!

84
00:06:17,679 --> 00:06:19,713
Yes, stop being
so selfish!

85
00:06:19,746 --> 00:06:21,679
Shut up! No one
asked you anything!

86
00:06:21,713 --> 00:06:26,813
The whole reason I'm in
this spot in the first
place is that my friends
had a fight just like this.

87
00:06:27,213 --> 00:06:33,413
[arguing]

88
00:06:33,446 --> 00:06:36,779
Guys! I know how we can
decide who gets to play
Snow White!

89
00:06:37,846 --> 00:06:39,246
We'll draw straws!

90
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:41,213
Oh hey, Natusmi...

91
00:06:41,246 --> 00:06:42,679
Just what are you
talking about?

92
00:06:42,713 --> 00:06:47,246
We can decide by randomly
drawing straws, or pieces
of paper in this case.

93
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:49,546
Also, to tell you
the truth...

94
00:06:49,579 --> 00:06:52,279
I'd like to be a part
of your play, too!

95
00:06:52,313 --> 00:06:57,513
If the end of your paper
is white, then you're Snow
White. If it's red, you're
the queen. If it's blue,

96
00:06:57,546 --> 00:06:59,046
you're one of the
dwarves.

97
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:02,646
I'll let you all go
first, and I'll just
take whatever one's
left at the end!

98
00:07:02,679 --> 00:07:03,413
Here...

99
00:07:03,446 --> 00:07:04,746
[groaning]

100
00:07:06,779 --> 00:07:09,679
Okay! I'll be the
first one to draw!

101
00:07:12,379 --> 00:07:14,046
[nervous groans]

102
00:07:16,846 --> 00:07:18,413
Ooohh!

103
00:07:19,413 --> 00:07:22,413
Aw, come on! I'm
the evil queen!

104
00:07:22,446 --> 00:07:25,746
Sorry, Tsukino. That's
just the luck of the
draw.

105
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:29,279
Oh, no! No!
No! No!

106
00:07:29,313 --> 00:07:29,846
[grunts]

107
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:31,613
[whining]

108
00:07:31,646 --> 00:07:33,613
All of us got
a blue one.

109
00:07:34,213 --> 00:07:35,046
Mmm...

110
00:07:36,179 --> 00:07:38,579
Wow. You all seem to
have terrible luck
drawing straws.

111
00:07:39,479 --> 00:07:41,046
[gasping screams]

112
00:07:42,546 --> 00:07:46,279
Well, look at that! It
appears that I get to be
Snow White. I'm sorry,
girls!

113
00:07:46,313 --> 00:07:47,279
[whining]

114
00:07:52,146 --> 00:07:57,379
None of those fools
realize that I rigged
it so I'd win and get
to be Snow White!

115
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:02,213
Your play's cast is
short by one dwarf?

116
00:08:02,613 --> 00:08:05,613
No way! I won't do it!
I want to play the prince!

117
00:08:05,646 --> 00:08:08,613
Sorry, but that part is
already taken. By Mamoru.

118
00:08:08,646 --> 00:08:09,979
Just forget it, then!

119
00:08:10,013 --> 00:08:14,579
Hmph! Fine! I guess that
we'll just have to do
it with six dwarves!

120
00:08:17,513 --> 00:08:20,313
The play's going to
be at Juban Hall, huh?

121
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:27,413
Now come forth,
Cardian Bipierrot!

122
00:08:28,113 --> 00:08:38,046
[flute music]

123
00:08:38,079 --> 00:08:41,413
Bipierrot!
Ha ha ha!

124
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:47,946
Next week, a large number
of people will gather at
Juban Hall. I want you to
steal their energy!

125
00:08:54,079 --> 00:08:55,513
Bipierrot!

126
00:08:57,746 --> 00:09:00,513
<i>What?! We're going</i>
<i>to do it again?!</i>

127
00:09:00,546 --> 00:09:04,679
Yes! Now, Snow White is
still asleep and the
prince gives her a
passionate kiss.

128
00:09:04,713 --> 00:09:08,679
This is the climactic
moment of the story!
It's the biggest scene
in the whole play!

129
00:09:08,713 --> 00:09:11,179
We'll practice it as
many times as it takes!

130
00:09:12,079 --> 00:09:16,546
Now, Mamoru. Could you
go over it with me one
more time, please?

131
00:09:16,579 --> 00:09:18,913
Sure. Let's do
it once more.

132
00:09:18,946 --> 00:09:21,446
And... Action!

133
00:09:21,479 --> 00:09:22,579
[whining]

134
00:09:22,613 --> 00:09:24,446
Oh, princess!

135
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:31,579
My true love, accept
this kiss with your sweet
lips and awaken at last
from you eternal slumber!

136
00:09:32,479 --> 00:09:35,346
No, don't kiss her
for real! No!

137
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:39,379
<i>This is my chance!</i>

138
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,079
Agh!

139
00:09:43,113 --> 00:09:46,346
That's not going to work!
Snow White is supposed to
be asleep, you have to
stay still!

140
00:09:46,579 --> 00:09:47,513
Darn!

141
00:09:48,646 --> 00:09:51,279
Oh, I'm sorry! Could
we do it just one
more time?

142
00:09:51,313 --> 00:09:52,579
We've done this
scene enough!

143
00:09:52,613 --> 00:09:54,579
Yeah, I think it's
about time that we
practiced something
else.

144
00:09:54,613 --> 00:10:01,013
What are you two talking
about? This is a very
important scene. We cannot
cut any corners, you know!

145
00:10:01,046 --> 00:10:03,246
Now, stop your
selfish whining!

146
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:06,279
Give me a break!
You're the most
selfish of us all!

147
00:10:06,313 --> 00:10:08,979
This is getting
ridiculous!

148
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,179
<i>See you later!</i>

149
00:10:10,213 --> 00:10:11,279
Goodnight!

150
00:10:11,613 --> 00:10:13,879
I'm taking off!
Good work!

151
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:16,379
Okay! Thank
you so much!

152
00:10:16,413 --> 00:10:19,479
Oh, Mamoru! You mind
if I walk with you?

153
00:10:19,513 --> 00:10:22,613
Since we're playing
characters who love
each other, we should
probably spend some

154
00:10:22,646 --> 00:10:25,413
time together so we can
get to know each other
better!

155
00:10:25,446 --> 00:10:30,113
[angry growling]

156
00:10:30,513 --> 00:10:35,413
What is her problem?
If she keeps this up,
the play is going to be
a huge flop!

157
00:10:35,446 --> 00:10:40,113
I really think she should
give up the role of Snow
White if she keeps on
acting as selfishly as

158
00:10:40,146 --> 00:10:41,779
she has been!

159
00:10:41,813 --> 00:10:45,113
Yes, I agree! I mean
after all, she only got
the part in the first
place because she

160
00:10:45,146 --> 00:10:46,079
cheated to get it.

161
00:10:46,113 --> 00:10:49,146
Ahem! What's all
this about cheating,
exactly?

162
00:10:49,179 --> 00:10:49,979
Heh...

163
00:10:51,146 --> 00:10:54,213
Hey! Start talking!
What do you mean by
cheating?!

164
00:10:54,246 --> 00:10:58,946
Hmm! I can't believe
you guys knew about
it all this time and
didn't tell me!

165
00:10:58,979 --> 00:10:59,846
[crying]

166
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:00,846
All right!

167
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:01,979
We'll explain...

168
00:11:02,013 --> 00:11:03,479
Yeah, it's simple.

169
00:11:04,013 --> 00:11:06,879
Natsumi rigged the
drawing so she'd be
Snow White.

170
00:11:06,913 --> 00:11:11,113
Every single one of
these had a colored
part at the end. When
she drew hers, she

171
00:11:11,146 --> 00:11:12,313
pulled the color
off.

172
00:11:12,346 --> 00:11:13,946
So it looked like
hers was white.

173
00:11:13,979 --> 00:11:19,813
THat's not fair! If you
knew this, then why
didn't you say anything
to her, huh?!

174
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:24,213
Because, we knew we'd
all continue fighting
no matter which one
of us got the role.

175
00:11:24,246 --> 00:11:29,879
That's right. And besides,
Natsumi doesn't really have
any close friends because
she's still new here.

176
00:11:29,913 --> 00:11:32,879
She's always by
herself and seems
so lonely...

177
00:11:32,913 --> 00:11:35,413
She also wanted to be
Snow White so badly.

178
00:11:35,446 --> 00:11:38,813
And to tell you the
truth, I was impressed
by her moxie!

179
00:11:38,846 --> 00:11:41,379
Wow, guys. That
was really kind.

180
00:11:41,413 --> 00:11:45,246
But still, is it true
friendship to ignore
what she did?

181
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:50,479
Cheating is cheating!
I say we call her on
it?! You with me?!

182
00:11:50,513 --> 00:11:52,946
Anyway!
If we ignore this-

183
00:11:53,946 --> 00:11:55,813
We should talk
to her.

184
00:11:55,846 --> 00:11:56,513
Mm-hmm!

185
00:11:56,546 --> 00:11:57,979
Ugh!

186
00:11:59,113 --> 00:12:02,246
Usagi! Are you sure you
should be the one to
handle this?

187
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:05,079
Leave it to me! I'll
talk to her at school
tomorrow and-

188
00:12:05,113 --> 00:12:07,346
[gasp]
Hey, there
she is!

189
00:12:11,079 --> 00:12:13,946
But why is she going
to the Hikawa Shrine?

190
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:23,846
<i>Sailor Moon!</i>

191
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:25,346
R!

192
00:12:38,594 --> 00:12:41,360
Sailor Moon R!

193
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:53,027
Oh, please...Please,
I really want this
play to be successful!

194
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:56,260
Please allow me to
steal Mamoru's kiss.

195
00:12:58,494 --> 00:13:00,660
Natsumi looks
so serious...

196
00:13:00,694 --> 00:13:03,927
<i>She must be very</i>
<i>passionate about</i>
<i>this play.</i>

197
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:13,327
She's still selfish, but
everybody knows that most
actresses are pretty
selfish.

198
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,227
I've even heard the
more selfish the actress,
the better her acting is!

199
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:21,127
You know what? I'm
totally fine with Natsumi
getting to be Snow White!

200
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:25,894
So let's all do our
best to make this
play a success for
Natsumi's sake. 'Kay?

201
00:13:25,927 --> 00:13:31,127
Mm! Hm! I don't like
that she gets to kiss
Mamoru, but I'll let
it go.

202
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,894
What? You say
something?

203
00:13:32,927 --> 00:13:36,360
Uh...not really!
Ha ha ha ha!

204
00:13:37,327 --> 00:13:42,827
Poor Snow White...
La la la...
She took one bite...
La la la...

205
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:47,860
That poisoned apple
knocked her out like
turning out the lights.

206
00:13:47,894 --> 00:13:52,494
And now she'll sleep
for all eternity.

207
00:13:52,527 --> 00:13:53,527
La la la!

208
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:58,460
It really is about
enough to make you
weep!

209
00:13:58,494 --> 00:14:00,860
[evil laughter]

210
00:14:00,894 --> 00:14:05,427
You have got to be
kidding me! This show
is not some kind of
costume contest! Why

211
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:08,060
in the world do I
have to wear this
ridiculous thing!

212
00:14:08,094 --> 00:14:10,594
Yeah, and how come I
have to wear the gorilla
one?!

213
00:14:10,627 --> 00:14:15,360
Oh, well it's because...
They say entertainment
has to be original.

214
00:14:15,394 --> 00:14:18,227
So I got us some
adorable animal
costumes!

215
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,460
This is what you think
of when you think
adorable?

216
00:14:21,494 --> 00:14:24,094
But you all do look
very cute in them!

217
00:14:25,027 --> 00:14:25,960
Hmph!

218
00:14:27,027 --> 00:14:29,327
And Tsukino, you look
great as the witch,
as well!

219
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,160
[growling]

220
00:14:31,194 --> 00:14:34,027
Well, then? Shall we
continue rehearsing?

221
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:38,694
I wanted to wear a
pretty dress like hers
and have a romantic
scene with the prince!

222
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,527
Oh, princess! My
true love!

223
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:48,294
Accept this kiss with
your sweet lips...

224
00:14:48,327 --> 00:14:49,994
And awaken at last...

225
00:14:50,027 --> 00:14:52,127
...from your
eternal slumber.

226
00:14:53,894 --> 00:14:56,260
Just what are you
doing?! Huh?!

227
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,894
Oh! Uh... I'm
rehearsing for
the play!

228
00:14:59,927 --> 00:15:01,294
Hm?

229
00:15:06,394 --> 00:15:08,794
Ail? Ail!

230
00:15:08,827 --> 00:15:11,860
Tomorrow's the
big day. Break
a leg.

231
00:15:17,427 --> 00:15:20,327
Why couldn't I
be the prince...

232
00:15:22,794 --> 00:15:25,494
Mirror, mirror, on
the wall...

233
00:15:25,527 --> 00:15:28,894
Tell me true: who
is the fairest of
them all?

234
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:31,160
What?! I'm the
second fairest?!

235
00:15:31,194 --> 00:15:35,494
Snow White is the
most beautiful in
all the land?
How vexing!

236
00:15:35,527 --> 00:15:36,127
[chuckling]

237
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,860
You are such a
ham, Usagi!

238
00:15:37,894 --> 00:15:39,994
How dare you?!

239
00:15:40,027 --> 00:15:43,927
I'm coming to see your play
tomorrow, so try to make
your performance at least
somewhat decent, all right?

240
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:44,760
[groaning]

241
00:15:44,794 --> 00:15:47,694
You can just stay
home for all I care!

242
00:15:52,494 --> 00:15:56,060
[chattering]

243
00:15:56,094 --> 00:15:58,060
Whoa, it's packed
out there!

244
00:15:58,094 --> 00:16:00,694
You know? I'm getting
kinda nervous!

245
00:16:00,727 --> 00:16:01,260
[ringing bell]

246
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:02,127
[gasps]

247
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,160
That's the first bell.
Everyone get to your
places now.

248
00:16:05,194 --> 00:16:06,494
Right!

249
00:16:06,527 --> 00:16:10,260
Once the second bell
rings, it's show time!
And Mamoru will kiss me!

250
00:16:10,294 --> 00:16:12,894
[ringing bell]

00:16:15,494 --> 00:16:20,927

[gasps]

254
00:16:27,827 --> 00:16:29,160
What's going on?

255
00:16:29,194 --> 00:16:30,227
A clown?!

256
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:32,394
There's a clown
in this play?

257
00:16:32,427 --> 00:16:34,194
Has the script changed?

258
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,860
Bipierrot!

259
00:16:40,227 --> 00:16:41,260
Oh no!

260
00:16:42,194 --> 00:16:49,960
Bipierrot! Bipierrot!
Bipierrot! Bipierrot!

261
00:16:49,994 --> 00:16:53,727
Whoa! They're destroying
the entire set right off
the bat!

262
00:16:54,227 --> 00:16:55,160
Stop it!!

263
00:16:55,194 --> 00:16:57,827
Don't ruin our play!
We worked so hard on
it!

Get off of me!

00:17:27,694 --> 00:17:29,227
You've gotta get
off me first!

280
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:31,194
Calm down! Climb out
one at a time!

00:17:31,227 --> 00:17:32,760
Stop moving away!

282
00:17:32,794 --> 00:17:33,627

We've gotta do
something fast!

288
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:43,894
Get off of me!

try to ruin our play!
I have had enough!

00:18:58,227 --> 00:19:02,194
And now in the name of
the moon, I'll punish
you!

Agh! Bipi?

309
00:19:18,827 --> 00:19:23,027
No one knows my true
identity, but all young
girls know who I am. The
Moonlight Knight is here!

310
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:25,094
Wow, it's the
Moonlight Knight!

311
00:19:25,127 --> 00:19:29,560
What is going on? This
play was supposed to be
Snow White, but now it's
Sailor Moon?

312
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,560
Huh?

313
00:19:31,594 --> 00:19:32,527
Who's that?

314
00:19:33,627 --> 00:19:36,227
Fueled by the flames of
passion and the nine
mantras!

315
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:39,094
Destroying all evil
with spiritual power!

316
00:19:41,227 --> 00:19:45,494
All while wearing
red heels! I am
Sailor Mars!

I can handle cram
school and studying.

320
00:19:56,294 --> 00:20:00,560
I always read reference
books, and in the National
Practice exam...

321
00:20:00,594 --> 00:20:02,727
I hold the rank
of number one!

Sailor Mercury!

323
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:11,527
I was known as the
Masked Legend. My face
is quite stunning, too!

324
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:14,894
And I am also the latest
Pretty Guardian to appear!

Bipi?!

331
00:20:37,327 --> 00:20:41,660
I took all of that time
away from my studying
so I could memorize
my lines!

332
00:20:41,694 --> 00:20:45,494
I could have read three
books instead, and I want
those hours back!
