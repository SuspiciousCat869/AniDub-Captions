1
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:01,788
What a relief --
Chibi-usa's all better.
But now she's back to
hitting on Mamo! The cure

2
00:02:01,822 --> 00:02:07,461
for my jealousy? Cake, of
course! But who's this
mysterious woman in the
bakery? Ack! The

3
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:12,299
Guardians have all turned
into fattening treats! No
more sweets for me.

4
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:15,135
In the name of the Moon,
I'll punish you!

5
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:26,279
Magic of Darkness:
Esmeraude's Invasion.

6
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:31,118
See you later!

7
00:02:34,554 --> 00:02:38,025
I'm so glad you
recovered and you're
feeling better now,
Chibi-usa.

8
00:02:38,058 --> 00:02:40,127
Yeah! Thank you, Luna!

9
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,731
To celebrate, would you like
it if I took you out? My
treat. Anything you want.

10
00:02:44,798 --> 00:02:46,199
Really?!

11
00:02:46,233 --> 00:02:48,602
Well, that's what I'd
like to do, but I've
already spent my allowance.

12
00:02:48,635 --> 00:02:50,637
So, why don't we play
hide and seek in the park?

13
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:53,974
Hey! No way! You just
said you'd treat me!

14
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:56,209
[awkward chuckling]
Sorry about that!

15
00:02:59,012 --> 00:02:59,646
[grunting]

16
00:03:00,747 --> 00:03:03,684
Yay! It's Mamo! I
missed you!

17
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:06,586
Hey! It's good to
see you, too, little one.

18
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:07,721
You mean it?

19
00:03:07,754 --> 00:03:10,557
[seething]
Chibi-Usa!

20
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:13,727
I have a great idea!
Let's go somewhere
special together, Mamo!

21
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,632
I want a new notebook
and a pencil case, and an
eraser... uh, and some
donuts, too!

22
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:23,236
Okay, hold on there. I
definitely want to celebrate
your recovery, but I have
to check my wallet.

23
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:24,504
Uh?

24
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:27,507
Uh--[awkward laughing]
Yeah, that sounds like
a fantastic idea!

25
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:30,343
Chibi-usa, why don't
you spend the whole day
with Mamo?

26
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:34,181
I mean, after all,
I've got a ton of other
very important things
I need to do! Bye-bye!

27
00:03:34,181 --> 00:03:36,016
Hey! Wait
for me!

28
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:40,020
What was up with her? I
thought she was going
to come with us.
Right, Mamo?

29
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,388
Yeah, that's weird.

30
00:03:41,521 --> 00:03:43,190
[grunting]

31
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,958
Usagi...

32
00:03:45,025 --> 00:03:49,362
It's just for today.
Chibi-Usa can't go home
to her mom, so I'll let
Mamo cheer her up on a

33
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:52,232
date. It's fine! It's
fine! It's totally
fine!

34
00:03:52,265 --> 00:03:53,600
Why don't you
just go with them?

35
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:56,670
Then, while you're out
together, you can try to
make up with Mamoru?

36
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:59,673
Because it kills me to
see him spoil her and
carry her around!

37
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:01,675
They're so cute,
I hate it!

38
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:04,344
This is so frustrating!

39
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:05,345
[groaning]

40
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:07,414
[yelping in pain]

41
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:08,749
Usagi!

42
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:24,297
Prince Demande...

43
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:26,199
Hm?

44
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:30,270
Preparations are nearly
complete. I shall be departing
for the 20th century shortly,
your highness.

45
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:34,741
Esmeraude... I suggest
you to remember how your
predecessor, Rubeus, died.

46
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:36,343
You must be
extremely careful.

47
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:38,612
[laughing]

48
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:41,014
I could never humiliate
myself like that!

49
00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:43,316
I have a strong sense
of grace and dignity!

50
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:44,584
I doubt that.

51
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:45,752
Saphir.

52
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:48,755
Don't underestimate the
20th Century Sailor
Guardians.

53
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:49,623
Hmm...

54
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:53,527
Why don't you take a
good look at this one
more time?

55
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:08,642
As you can see, my brother,
the prince, is struggling
with these 30th century
Sailor Guardians.

56
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:13,747
If Rubeus had completed
our plan and filled the
20th Century Crystal
Points with Dark Energy,

57
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:17,651
they never would have
been able to wield this
much power and use it
against us.

58
00:05:19,719 --> 00:05:22,556
Thank you for the
reminder, Saphir.

59
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:24,991
Sorry!

60
00:05:25,025 --> 00:05:29,162
This display of yours is
merely proof of Rubeus's
complete incompetence!

61
00:05:29,196 --> 00:05:33,500
My plan is different.
Since I am going to be
working in the 20th
century, I intend to

62
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:37,737
permanently infuse it
with the Dark Power of
the Malefic Black
Crystal. I will plant the

63
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:43,009
seeds for our victory far
into the future.
Considering the failures
of the last strategy,

64
00:05:43,043 --> 00:05:47,414
I'm confident that this
will not only be easier,
but deadly and effective!

65
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:50,984
It's an interesting
strategy, but our current
transfer methods

66
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:55,322
cannot transmit that
much Dark Power to 20th
Century Earth.

67
00:05:55,322 --> 00:05:58,491
Furthermore, we would
need to open a remarkably
powerful Dark Gate.

68
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:02,262
You underestimate me.
I haven't overlooked
that...

69
00:06:06,633 --> 00:06:11,371
We have a unique
opportunity... in the
primitive 20th Century
world, there are sites

70
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:17,377
known as Negative Points.
Fortunately for us, these
specific locations are
already teeming with

71
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:22,782
Negative Energy, just
waiting to be tapped. If
we drive wedges filled
with the power of the

72
00:06:22,816 --> 00:06:28,421
Malefic Black Crystal
into those Points, we can
transmit Dark Power from
the future...

73
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:47,657
Once those wedges have
absorbed enough Dark
Power and fully matured,
the Dark Gate will open.

74
00:06:48,372 --> 00:06:54,364
That is our chance to
strike, and we'll send a
burst of Dark Power from
the Malefic Black Crystal.

75
00:06:54,685 --> 00:07:00,642
Then, we'll transform the
world into a beautiful
ebony planet! Victory
will be ours!

76
00:07:02,313 --> 00:07:05,149
I've already asked Saphir
to create the Dark
Henges.

77
00:07:05,149 --> 00:07:09,653
Those are the critical
wedges infused with the
power of the Malefic
Black Crystal.

78
00:07:10,688 --> 00:07:11,322
Mm.

79
00:07:17,227 --> 00:07:18,062
Mm!

80
00:07:19,964 --> 00:07:24,034
I think it's in poor taste,
but I've followed your
instructions to shape the
henges just like you.

81
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:29,573
I'm happy to create as
many as we need, but don't
make me do unnecessary work
like Rubeus did with his

82
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,142
string of failures.
Understood?

83
00:07:32,142 --> 00:07:33,677
I would never
dream of it!

84
00:07:35,512 --> 00:07:39,483
I plan to keep this
simple. I don't want to
be apart from my beloved
for that long. [giggling]

85
00:07:41,685 --> 00:07:47,391
Esmeraude, I hereby grant
you permission to carry
out your plan. Do not
fail me.

86
00:07:47,424 --> 00:07:53,230
Thank you, my dear lord.
I swear I will do my very
best to please you and make
sure this plan is a success.

87
00:07:53,297 --> 00:07:57,401
[laughing]

88
00:07:58,302 --> 00:08:04,284
[chatting]

89
00:08:12,462 --> 00:08:16,933
Check it out. The pastry
shop is having a grand
opening sale!
All-you-can-eat cakes!

90
00:08:16,967 --> 00:08:18,802
Sounds too good
to be true!

91
00:08:18,835 --> 00:08:21,738
My heart's racing, I
can't stand it!

92
00:08:21,771 --> 00:08:24,241
It's so tempting,
it's evil!

93
00:08:24,274 --> 00:08:27,911
Did you know that cakes
are remarkably high in
calories? Not only do
they exceed the

94
00:08:27,911 --> 00:08:31,681
recommended dietary
guidelines, but they also
lack healthy vitamins or
nutrients.

95
00:08:31,748 --> 00:08:33,583
Thanks, right,
okay, we got it.

96
00:08:33,617 --> 00:08:35,418
Ami...

97
00:08:35,452 --> 00:08:38,922
Don't you understand?
Cakes are nourishment for
the soul. I mean, we've
been working so hard,

98
00:08:38,955 --> 00:08:41,424
I think we deserve
a treat like this to
recharge.

99
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:42,425
You'll get fat!

100
00:08:42,459 --> 00:08:43,593
Shush you!

101
00:08:44,995 --> 00:08:47,764
Fine. But don't
complain to me when you
get on that scale
tonight.

102
00:08:47,764 --> 00:08:50,934
You know, Usagi and
Chibi-usa would love
this. Let's call them!

103
00:08:50,934 --> 00:08:52,936
I already did, but they
didn't answer the phone.

104
00:08:52,969 --> 00:08:57,440
Knowing those two, they'll
probably catch a whiff of
these cakes and follow the
smell here, anyway.

105
00:08:57,474 --> 00:09:00,410
So! Come on, let's go
in! Who's ready for
cake?!

106
00:09:00,477 --> 00:09:01,578
Me!

107
00:09:01,678 --> 00:09:02,812
You'll regret it.

108
00:09:10,553 --> 00:09:14,491
Oh, so this is an Earth
city in the 20th Century.

109
00:09:14,691 --> 00:09:15,925
How primitive.

110
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,305
But I have to admit,
these people's savage
energy is kind of
charming.

111
00:09:34,811 --> 00:09:36,646
[laughing]

112
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:39,382
Looks like I found a
Negative Point.

113
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:40,250
[chuckling]

114
00:09:43,753 --> 00:09:45,822
Excuse me! Excuse
me! Sorry!

115
00:09:45,822 --> 00:09:48,425
[gasping]
So many cakes!

116
00:09:48,491 --> 00:09:53,596
I'm just gonna stuff
my face! I'm going to eat
so much, this place won't
have any left over!

117
00:09:55,765 --> 00:09:59,502
[chatting]

118
00:09:59,536 --> 00:10:00,837
This is my fifth one.

119
00:10:00,837 --> 00:10:02,806
Yeah? I'm on my sixth!

120
00:10:02,806 --> 00:10:04,541
Ah! Bliss!

121
00:10:04,574 --> 00:10:08,478
When I think about all
the battles we fought,
it was worth it just to
get to this day!

122
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:10,313
I'm in heaven!

123
00:10:12,048 --> 00:10:16,853
How dare those girls keep
me locked up in here while
they stuff their fat faces
with cake!

124
00:10:16,986 --> 00:10:20,851
I'm goin' back
for more!

125
00:10:20,917 --> 00:10:26,530
Amazing! It's so good!
So very, very good!

126
00:10:26,563 --> 00:10:29,433
[gobbling]
Oh, this one's
good, too!

127
00:10:29,566 --> 00:10:31,802
[gobbling]
[giggling]

128
00:10:33,618 --> 00:10:39,091
How can this be so
good?! I've never tasted
anything like this! Oh!

129
00:10:39,124 --> 00:10:40,926
[laughing]

130
00:10:41,093 --> 00:10:43,694
I feel like I could eat
every cake on earth!

131
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,928
Usagi?!

132
00:10:45,028 --> 00:10:46,830
[gobbling]

133
00:10:46,863 --> 00:10:51,701
Stop eating and open
this basket!! Luna,
where is everyone?

134
00:10:52,268 --> 00:10:53,770
See for yourself.

135
00:10:53,837 --> 00:10:55,872
For crying out loud,
have some self control!

136
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:58,174
Cake fills the void
in my heart! Let go!

137
00:10:58,208 --> 00:10:59,342
Cut it out, right now!

138
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:00,777
Shut up!

139
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:01,811
Usagi!

140
00:11:01,845 --> 00:11:03,346
Must eat cake!

141
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:05,348
Oh, sorry, ma'am.

142
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:07,851
Oh! The nerve!

143
00:11:08,718 --> 00:11:11,221
[judgmental chatting]

144
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:13,757
[gasping]

145
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:16,126
[judgmental chatting]

146
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:21,618
Uh, excuse me.
[awkward laughing]

147
00:11:24,835 --> 00:11:27,471
[sighing]

148
00:11:27,771 --> 00:11:31,689
How could I lose my cool
and get so carried away
back there?

149
00:11:31,689 --> 00:11:35,693
But those cake things
were just so cute! I
couldn't help myself. Oh,
and I can't believe those

150
00:11:35,693 --> 00:11:40,364
20th Century humans were
staring at me like that!
So humiliating!

151
00:11:40,531 --> 00:11:45,502
Fine! Those girls will
pay a heavy price for
judging me! I'll make
all of them the first

152
00:11:45,536 --> 00:11:50,207
sacrifices to the Dark
Henge! [laughing]

153
00:11:53,544 --> 00:11:59,383
[laughing]

154
00:12:09,593 --> 00:12:11,495
Sailor Moon...

155
00:12:11,528 --> 00:12:12,596
... R!

156
00:12:25,576 --> 00:12:28,646
Sailor Moon! R!

157
00:12:29,613 --> 00:12:32,750
[chatting]

158
00:12:32,783 --> 00:12:35,352
Wow, cake really is
nourishment for the soul.

159
00:12:35,419 --> 00:12:40,090
Yeah, I have a feeling
that's especially true
for Usagi. I mean, her
soul must be famished

160
00:12:40,124 --> 00:12:41,925
because she's eating
everything in sight.

161
00:12:41,925 --> 00:12:46,764
... and then Mamo picked
up Chibi-Usa and they got
all cuddly! That little
girl is using her

162
00:12:46,797 --> 00:12:50,067
adorable size as an
excuse to snuggle up
to my Mamo!

163
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:54,171
I'm so angry! Make it
better, Minako!

164
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,241
Mamo!

165
00:12:57,241 --> 00:12:58,676
There, there, Usagi.

166
00:12:58,742 --> 00:13:02,146
Ugh, all those tears and
snot. I've really lost
my appetite.

167
00:13:02,146 --> 00:13:03,414
[sobbing]
Oh, Rei!

168
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,349
Ugh, Usagi...

169
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:12,690
[chuckling]
This will do.

170
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,803
The Negative Point is
right down here.

171
00:13:30,074 --> 00:13:31,475
Come, Dark Henge!

172
00:13:58,802 --> 00:14:00,471
[laughing]

173
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:07,711
Ah, the sweet sensation
of Dark Power flowing in
from the future. Come
forward, Droid!

174
00:14:15,419 --> 00:14:16,487
Maxipan!

175
00:14:16,587 --> 00:14:18,889
[laughing]

176
00:14:18,889 --> 00:14:22,593
It'll take a while for
the Dark Henge to put a
barrier on this spot,

177
00:14:22,626 --> 00:14:24,328
but in the
meantime...

178
00:14:24,395 --> 00:14:29,433
Maxipan, I command you to
dispose of the girls
outside. Be sure to do it
discreetly.

179
00:14:29,466 --> 00:14:30,601
Maxipan!

180
00:14:32,736 --> 00:14:35,706
Now then, I have
another job to do.

181
00:14:36,407 --> 00:14:39,243
[chuckling]

182
00:14:39,576 --> 00:14:44,248
I've finally calmed down.
Thanks, guys. Hey, aren't
any of you gonna eat
more?

183
00:14:44,281 --> 00:14:45,449
[laughing]

184
00:14:45,482 --> 00:14:47,384
Wow! Look at all those
cakes!

185
00:14:47,418 --> 00:14:49,086
Huh?? Chibi-Usa!?

186
00:14:49,119 --> 00:14:50,721
Hey! You're
all here!

187
00:14:50,721 --> 00:14:54,057
Whoa, is this how
much you ate?! My
gosh!

188
00:14:54,057 --> 00:14:57,428
Why should you care?! And
whose fault is it that
I'm stuffing my face,
anyway?!

189
00:14:57,461 --> 00:14:58,128
What do you mean?!

190
00:14:58,162 --> 00:14:59,630
Don't pretend you
don't know!

191
00:14:59,663 --> 00:15:04,368
[sticking tongue out]

192
00:15:04,435 --> 00:15:05,803
This was a mistake.

193
00:15:06,437 --> 00:15:08,372
[gasping]

194
00:15:08,472 --> 00:15:09,606
W-What going on?

195
00:15:09,606 --> 00:15:10,641
What's wrong?!

196
00:15:11,108 --> 00:15:12,558
[gasping]

197
00:15:12,591 --> 00:15:14,259
We've got a problem!

198
00:15:15,527 --> 00:15:16,261
Uh!

199
00:15:17,229 --> 00:15:18,230
Wait!

200
00:15:19,064 --> 00:15:20,299
[grunting]

201
00:15:21,567 --> 00:15:23,902
Who are you and what are
you trying to do?!

202
00:15:23,936 --> 00:15:26,038
[laughing]

203
00:15:26,371 --> 00:15:27,739
[grunting]

204
00:15:28,207 --> 00:15:29,107
Give me that!

205
00:15:29,141 --> 00:15:32,144
No way! This one's all
mine! I found it first!

206
00:15:32,211 --> 00:15:35,047
There's something weird
about this food! Don't
eat it, Usako!

207
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:38,283
Usako?! You hear that?!
That must mean he still
cares!

208
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:40,118
That's not
important right now!

209
00:15:40,185 --> 00:15:42,287
We've got a serious
situation, Usagi!

210
00:15:42,354 --> 00:15:43,422
Sorry about that.

211
00:15:44,022 --> 00:15:45,924
[growling]

212
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:47,426
Maxipan!

213
00:15:47,526 --> 00:15:48,527
[grunting]

214
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,062
Ahhhh!

215
00:15:50,095 --> 00:15:53,532
Get Chibi-usa out of
here! I'll handle this
monster!

216
00:15:53,565 --> 00:15:55,367
Got it! Hurry, Usagi!

217
00:15:55,367 --> 00:15:56,201
But shouldn't--

218
00:15:56,201 --> 00:15:57,269
Quickly!

219
00:15:57,302 --> 00:15:58,036
Okay!

220
00:15:58,203 --> 00:15:59,204
Maxipan!

221
00:15:59,238 --> 00:16:00,072
Look out!

222
00:16:01,473 --> 00:16:04,443
Looks like it's time
for some exercise to
work off all those cakes.

223
00:16:04,443 --> 00:16:07,613
Artemis, Luna. Make sure
you take care of
Chibi-Usa.

224
00:16:07,646 --> 00:16:08,447
Got it!

225
00:16:08,513 --> 00:16:09,982
Good luck, everyone.

226
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:15,420
Moon Crystal Power Make
Up!

227
00:16:20,359 --> 00:16:26,098
Mars Star Power Make Up!

228
00:16:33,205 --> 00:16:37,476
Mercury Star Power Make
Up!

229
00:16:42,914 --> 00:16:47,286
Jupiter Star Power Make
Up!

230
00:16:51,857 --> 00:16:55,994
Venus Star Power Make Up!

231
00:17:13,578 --> 00:17:15,247
Sailor Mars!

232
00:17:16,415 --> 00:17:18,483
Sailor Mercury!

233
00:17:19,551 --> 00:17:21,920
Sailor Jupiter!

234
00:17:23,055 --> 00:17:25,157
Sailor Venus!

235
00:17:30,562 --> 00:17:33,098
Sailor Moon!

236
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:35,834
[grunting]

237
00:17:35,867 --> 00:17:37,269
Maxipan!

238
00:17:37,502 --> 00:17:38,503
[laughing]

239
00:17:38,503 --> 00:17:39,938
Stop right there!

240
00:17:40,005 --> 00:17:40,672
Huh?

241
00:17:40,706 --> 00:17:42,541
We're the Guardians
of Justice!

242
00:17:42,574 --> 00:17:45,010
And our job is to
bring down evil!

243
00:17:45,043 --> 00:17:47,379
You ruined the dreams of
innocent girls...

244
00:17:47,412 --> 00:17:49,815
... and trampled on their
simple pleasures!

245
00:17:50,816 --> 00:17:54,186
And now, in the name
of the moon, I'll
punish you!

246
00:17:55,087 --> 00:17:58,757
[grunting]
Maxipan!

247
00:17:58,857 --> 00:17:59,424
[dodging]

248
00:18:02,561 --> 00:18:09,101
Burning Mandala!

249
00:18:09,134 --> 00:18:10,268
Maxipan!

00:18:10,302 --> 00:18:12,137
[grunting]

251
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:13,472
Mars! Ah!

252
00:18:14,072 --> 00:18:15,407
Mars! Sailor Moon!

253
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,576
I can't move!
I'm stuck!

254
00:18:17,576 --> 00:18:19,478
We've been frosted
like a cake!

255
00:18:19,945 --> 00:18:20,979
[grunting]

256
00:18:21,012 --> 00:18:22,013
Maxipan!

00:18:25,217 --> 00:18:27,419
[gasping]

258
00:18:27,552 --> 00:18:28,620
Jupiter!

259
00:18:28,653 --> 00:18:32,057
Watch out! She's too fast
with her sugary blast!

260
00:18:32,057 --> 00:18:36,294
Venus, be careful! Her
body's been transformed!
She's as delicate as sugar!

261
00:18:36,328 --> 00:18:38,430
If you bump into
her, she'll crumble
to pieces!

262
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:39,898
Are you serious?!

263
00:18:39,898 --> 00:18:42,401
The same goes for all the
other girls that are
trapped here!

264
00:18:42,434 --> 00:18:43,235
[gasping]

265
00:18:43,435 --> 00:18:44,970
Maxipan!

266
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:47,906
Venus Love Me Chain!

267
00:18:48,407 --> 00:18:50,242
[grunting]

268
00:18:50,509 --> 00:18:52,778
[gasping]

00:18:52,811 --> 00:18:53,912
Maxipan!

270
00:18:53,979 --> 00:18:54,813
Ahhh!

271
00:18:54,846 --> 00:18:55,814
Oh, great.

272
00:18:55,881 --> 00:18:57,382
I feel like a
marshmallow.

273
00:18:59,251 --> 00:19:00,118
[grunting]

274
00:19:00,385 --> 00:19:03,288
[grunting]

00:19:03,555 --> 00:19:04,389
[grunting]

276
00:19:04,456 --> 00:19:05,457
Enough already!

277
00:19:05,524 --> 00:19:06,825
Yeah, cut it out!

278
00:19:06,858 --> 00:19:09,127
[laughing]
Maxipan!

279
00:19:11,129 --> 00:19:12,063
Huh?!

280
00:19:12,464 --> 00:19:14,132
[chuckling]

281
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:15,967
Tuxedo Mask!

282
00:19:15,967 --> 00:19:19,070
Sugary delicacies are an
art that nourish a
girl's dreams.

283
00:19:19,171 --> 00:19:23,842
These young girls admire
beauty and sometimes,
their passion can melt
their delicate hearts.

284
00:19:23,975 --> 00:19:25,243
Uh, what?

285
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:27,813
While it's true that sweet
treats can melt away
one's worries,

286
00:19:27,813 --> 00:19:30,782
there are other times
where it is the sugar
that melts instead.

287
00:19:30,816 --> 00:19:33,318
Okay, you've lost me
this time around.

288
00:19:33,351 --> 00:19:37,456
I know! I've got it! The
hint is the sugar composition
of her body! Leave it to me!

289
00:19:37,456 --> 00:19:38,356
Maxipan!

290
00:19:40,158 --> 00:19:44,362
Shine Aqua Illusion!

[struggling]

292
00:19:54,573 --> 00:19:56,208
You did it!
It's melting!

293
00:19:56,241 --> 00:19:58,143
Yes! Way to go, Mercury!

294
00:19:58,143 --> 00:20:01,346
[struggling]
Max...i...pan.

295
00:20:02,948 --> 00:20:04,483
Sailor Moon!
Now's your chance!

296
00:20:04,516 --> 00:20:05,484
Okay!

297
00:20:24,569 --> 00:20:31,209
Moon Princess Halation!

298
00:20:35,146 --> 00:20:40,852
[grunting and groaning]

299
00:20:53,465 --> 00:20:55,467
Wait, what the hell
is going on here?!

300
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:59,471
[groaning]

301
00:20:59,504 --> 00:21:01,306
Time to go!

302
00:21:03,441 --> 00:21:04,543
Huh?!

303
00:21:07,145 --> 00:21:09,047
[gasping]
That's impossible!

304
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,449
Didn't you ever learn
it's not polite to spy?

305
00:21:11,516 --> 00:21:13,885
[gasping]
Who dares to--

306
00:21:15,921 --> 00:21:18,056
Oh... you're a
hottie.

307
00:21:18,089 --> 00:21:18,857
Uh--farewell!

308
00:21:20,025 --> 00:21:21,459
Cut it out! Don't you
dare look at him like
that!

309
00:21:21,526 --> 00:21:24,529
I'll bet you're the one
who was controlling that
desert droid out front.

310
00:21:24,563 --> 00:21:28,199
Ah, so you're the
Sailor Guardians
I've heard about.

311
00:21:28,199 --> 00:21:32,370
Well, you're just skinny,
pimply school girls with
flat chests and flat butts.

312
00:21:32,404 --> 00:21:34,039
Who are you
calling flat?

313
00:21:34,936 --> 00:21:38,152
We prefer to think of
ourselves as small, but
toned, old lady!

314
00:21:38,152 --> 00:21:40,555
What?! Old Lady? Is that
what you said?

315
00:21:40,588 --> 00:21:44,625
How dare you! You brat!
[growling]

316
00:21:48,296 --> 00:21:52,133
Right! Listen up,
pipsqueaks! You're
looking at a proud
member of the Black

317
00:21:52,133 --> 00:21:58,130
Moon Clan. I am formidable
and I will do whatever it
takes to make sure we
conquer the 20th century.

318
00:21:58,764 --> 00:22:03,202
Every man in this world
will kneel before me.
For I am the greatest
beauty that ever was!

319
00:22:03,235 --> 00:22:09,075
Remember my name:
Esmeraude! [laughing]

320
00:22:09,108 --> 00:22:10,009
[struggling]

321
00:22:10,042 --> 00:22:12,178
Her awful laugh is as bad
as her attitude.

322
00:22:13,212 --> 00:22:16,182
I will be the one to
defeat you once and
for all.

323
00:22:16,215 --> 00:22:21,153
Your doom awaits at
the hands of Esmeraude!
[laughing]

324
00:22:21,253 --> 00:22:22,555
Esmeraude.

325
00:22:25,858 --> 00:22:29,161
Team, I think we just met
our new mortal enemy.
Better buckle up.

326
00:24:12,164 --> 00:24:17,136
My dear Mamo, I finally
know the reason why
you've been avoiding
me lately.

327
00:24:17,169 --> 00:24:18,971
You do?

328
00:24:19,004 --> 00:24:22,241
But don't worry. I know
that love is forever and
our feelings for each
other will never change.

329
00:24:22,308 --> 00:24:25,878
Here's the proof.
Pro wrestling.

330
00:24:25,911 --> 00:24:28,714
You mean a "promise
ring"?

331
00:24:28,747 --> 00:24:33,953
Next time on Sailor
Moon R: "Shared Feelings:
Usagi and Mamoru in Love
Once Again".

332
00:24:33,953 --> 00:24:36,655
The moonlight is a
messenger of love.
