1
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:00,170
Chibi-Usa, can you
hear us?

2
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:04,010
Trust me when I tell
you this, you're not
alone.

3
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:06,050
We're all right
here with you.

4
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:09,220
Death Phantom! I
will not allow you
to turn our world
into darkness!

5
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:11,180
I am Sailor Moon!

6
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:15,170
And in the name of
the moon, I'll purge
your evil energy!

7
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:29,150
The time has come
to destroy the Earth!

8
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:36,140
[evil snickering]

9
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:43,110
I am Death Phantom, and
it would be my pleasure
to turn this world
into darkness!

10
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,060
[maniacal laughter]

11
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:04,010
The power of the
Malefic Black Crystal
is becoming much
stronger!

12
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:07,180
We're running out of
time! Do we know if
Chibi-Usa's been rescued?

13
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:09,160
There's no word yet.

14
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:11,130
But if the Dark
Gate opens..

15
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:15,150
..and allows the energy
of the Malefic Black Crystal
to be fired at us from
from Planet Nemesis...

16
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:18,030
The Earth will
be destroyed.

17
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:22,100
In that case...
We have to win!

18
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:37,160
"The Final Battle
Between Light and Dark:
Pledge of Love for
the Future!"

19
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:55,030
Release the power of
the Malefic Black
Crystal!

20
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,040
Chibi-Usa!
[gasp]

21
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:05,140
[terrified gasps]

22
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:09,040
It is time.
The Dark Gate
will open soon.

23
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:13,180
Proceed, Wiseman.
Send in the power
of the Malefic
Black Crystal.

24
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:19,110
Once you have done so,
I will channel that power
and turn this world
into dust!

25
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,190
She can't be serious!

26
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,180
I know! Even
she can't handle
that much power!

27
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:27,000
Chibi-Usa! If you
do this, you'll
die as well!

28
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:29,150
Then so be it!
I don't fear
death.

29
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,090
Darkness is all that
exists in this world.

30
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:37,090
I would rather destroy
everything than live in
a world that refuses
to love me.

31
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,120
You've been tricked
into thinking that!

32
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:40,140
Chibi-Usa!

33
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:42,160
What are you
talking about?

34
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:46,140
I know that none of you
have ever cared about
what happens to me!

35
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:48,040
That's not true,
Chibi-Usa!

36
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:49,170
All of us care!

37
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:51,120
Shut up!
Be Quiet!

38
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:53,150
[painful screaming]

39
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,200
[groaning and gasping]

40
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:59,140
I can't stand listening
to you anymore so
you'll be the
first to go.

41
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:00,140
Chibi-Usa!

42
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:01,150
Don't do it!

43
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,140
[evil chuckling]

44
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:04,150
Chibi-Usa!

45
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,110
Please, stop!

46
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:10,230
Die!

47
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,425
[stunned gasp]

48
00:05:11,425 --> 00:05:17,180
[yelling in pain]

49
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:19,040
[defeated groan]

50
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:22,030
Are you alright?
Mamo, talk to me!

51
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,060
I don't believe it...

52
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:26,180
He was willing
to sacrifice
himself just
to save her?!

53
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:28,020
Of course he was!

54
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:28,487
What?

55
00:05:28,487 --> 00:05:30,180
Our friendship
is that strong.

56
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:33,180
Yes, we would
do anything
for each other.

57
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:35,130
What sentimental
rubbish!

58
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:37,130
It's all true!

59
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:40,130
And you are one
of us! We are all
friends!

60
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:44,190
And what that means is
we would risk our lives
to protect you too,
Chibi-Usa.

61
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:47,040
I am one of
your friends?

62
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:49,040
That's right.

63
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:53,190
You've always been a
good friend to us
and we couldn't stand
to lose you.

64
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:57,230
The truth is,
we love you..more
than you know.

65
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:59,110
[shocked gasp]

66
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,110
Chibi-Usa.

67
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:03,230
We are your friends.

68
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:06,190
[sounds of struggle]

69
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:07,230
Black Lady.

70
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:08,220
[gasp]

71
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:13,220
Do not listen
to their nonsense.

72
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:17,030
The truth lies
in total
darkness.

73
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:20,000
Receive its power,
Black Lady.

74
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:30,090
I will send you the
energy of the Malefic
Black Crystal
once again.

75
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:32,200
Wiseman's right.

76
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,200
I won't allow you
to fool me.

77
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:38,020
Chibi-Usa! You
mustn't let this
evil energy
possess you!

78
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:42,220
This world will turn into
darkness and I won't let
any of you interfere!

79
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:44,120
[quick grunt]

80
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:53,200
[sounds of distress]

81
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:57,210
To win this battle,
to stand strong against
this enemy...

82
00:06:57,210 --> 00:07:01,020
You can't have a
frivolous half-hearted
love between you.

83
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:02,080
[grunt]

84
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:05,180
Unless the two of you
share an unbreakable
bond of love...

85
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:09,110
You will not be
able to overcome the
danger that you
will face.

86
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,220
I've just begun!
I'll fill this world
with darkness!

87
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:14,130
[evil laughter]

88
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:17,160
I'll find a way to
save you, no matter
what it takes!

89
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:19,190
Sailor Moon,
I'll help you.

90
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:24,010
We'll overcome this
challenge with our
love and together we
will save our daughter.

91
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:29,100
Alright!

92
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:31,180
Chibi-Usa,
we're going
to save you!

93
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:36,190
The evil energy that
possesses you...
We're going to
remove it!

94
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:39,040
I will not let
you defeat me!

95
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:40,180
Bring it on!

96
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:47,100
Moon Crystal Power!

97
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:52,110
What?!

98
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:08,220
[stunned gasp]

99
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:09,140
Ah!

100
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:10,140
She's...

101
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:13,110
...no longer Sailor Moon!

102
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:17,140
She's become
Neo Queen
Serenity!

103
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:19,030
No way!

104
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,150
Listen to me, Small Lady.
Try to remember...

105
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:26,150
...back to when you
were just a child...

106
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:27,190
[startled breath]

107
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:32,110
[sounds of discomfort]

108
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:36,180
[loud crying]

109
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:38,020
Crying won't
help you.

110
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:39,020
[small sniffle]

111
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:41,130
Oh Mommy
I hate you!

112
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:44,020
Daddy...Help
me up!

113
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:46,010
Get up by
yourself.

114
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:50,000
Chibi-Usa, do you
understand why
we didn't help you
up back then?

115
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:53,200
It's because you
needed to know
you had the strength
to stand on your own.

116
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:58,220
We held back because
we wanted to raise you to
be the kind of girl
who can meet any challenge.

117
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:07,210
No matter how
difficult it
might be.

118
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:15,030
It was out
of love?

119
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,120
What a poor
love-starved bunny
you are!

120
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:21,210
Don't be fooled
by their sweet words!

121
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:22,220
Usagi!

122
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:29,210
Mamoru!

123
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:32,020
You mustn't
trust anyone.

124
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:36,120
Humans are born alone,
and in the end, they die
alone.

125
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:39,090
The only thing
you can trust
is the darkness.

126
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:42,160
I was born alone,
and i'll die alone.

127
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:46,210
I can only trust
the darkness.

128
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:52,110
Daddy! Mommy!
Come back!
Don't leave me!

129
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:55,210
You see the truth!
You were always
alone!

130
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:59,000
Yes. I have
always been alone.

131
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:00,170
That's only
an illusion!

132
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:02,100
She's right!
Don't be tricked!

133
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:05,120
The memories are clear,
I was always alone.

134
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:07,140
And nothing you
can say can change that!

135
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:09,140
[screams of terror]

136
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,010
I can see the truth!

137
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:13,160
[groans of pain]

138
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:17,200
Small Lady! Listen to
me, please! You must
leave this place
immediately!

139
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:21,020
It's dangerous, not
just for your mind,
but for your body
as well!

140
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:22,160
The same goes for you.

141
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:25,170
If you stay here much
longer you are sure
to die.

142
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:27,190
So go ahead
and leave while
you can!

143
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,180
It's not my
life that's
important!

144
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:33,180
The only thing that
matters is that you
survive.

145
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:39,120
Remember, Small Lady...
Everybody experiences
pain and sadness within
their lives.

146
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:43,030
There are times when
you feel like
burying yourself
within your sadness.

147
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,230
But you have to find the
strength to bear
it and move forward!

148
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,210
Despite everything that
happens to us, we must
always hold tight to our
memories of love!

149
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:57,000
Please, try to
remember!

150
00:10:57,010 --> 00:10:58,110
[sweet giggling]

151
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,020
Those happy
memories you
shared with
everyone...

152
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:02,180
I know those times
were not illusions.

153
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:06,100
They were real
experiences, fueled
by real feelings!

154
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:07,210
[disgusted reaction]

155
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:10,060
Chibi-Usa!

156
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:17,050
Trust me when I
tell you you're
not alone.

157
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:18,230
So warm...

158
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:24,030
What you're feeling right
now, is the deep emotional
connection that human
beings share.

159
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:28,230
Tell me something.
Why do you care so
much about me?

160
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:37,040
Because I have always
loved you and I
always will, Chibi-Usa.

161
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:40,190
I believe you
now, and it
warms my
heart.

162
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:57,200
Chibi-Usa!

163
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,220
She's back to
her former self!

164
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:01,180
They did it!

165
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:15,230
Thank goodness.

166
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:22,230
Sailor Moon, R!

167
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:44,200
Sailor Moon, R!

168
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:48,010
Chibi-Usa...
Chibi-Usa!

169
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:48,477
[concerned gasps]

170
00:12:48,477 --> 00:12:50,000
Can you hear me?

171
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:51,100
Please wake up!

172
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:52,210
[gasp]

173
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:55,010
Sailor Moon,
is that you?

174
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:56,230
Welcome back.

175
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Thank you.
For saving me.

176
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:04,120
I understand now,
I'm not alone!

177
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:08,130
You've all been
with me the whole
time.

178
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:12,000
And knowing that,
made me feel all
warm inside.

179
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:16,230
And I hope you
realize that you'll always
be first in Neo Queen
Serenity's heart.

180
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:17,426
Yes.

181
00:13:17,426 --> 00:13:20,040
I'm so glad
that you're alright.

182
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:20,476
[small breath]

183
00:13:20,476 --> 00:13:21,150
[startled gasp]

184
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,050
Sailor Moon!

185
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:25,160
Are you okay,
Usako?

186
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:26,220
I think so.

187
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:31,020
But, Sailor Moon...
Don't forget you used
the Silver Crystal!

188
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,200
It's alright,
I'm fine.

189
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:38,020
[panicked reactions]

190
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:39,140
What's happening?

191
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:44,220
You may have stopped
Black Lady, but the
Dark Gate has
already opened!

192
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:46,010
[grunt]

193
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:47,110
[evil snickering]

194
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,120
Soon, the immense
energy of the Malefic
Black Crystal will
reach Earth!

195
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:54,150
And once it does, there
will be no stopping it!

196
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:57,000
The destruction
of this world
is at hand!

197
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:58,110
[sinister chuckling]

198
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,040
Not if we can
help it!

199
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:01,130
[satisfied chuckle]

200
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:06,030
Fools! You people
will be destroyed,
along with this cursed
planet!

201
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:12,030
[painful screaming]

202
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:24,050
What's that?!

203
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:26,030
The Dark Gate is
about to open!

204
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:29,010
It looks like
we were too late!

205
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:30,210
[evil laughter]

206
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:34,020
[screaming]

207
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:38,120
We have to do
something quickly or
Earth will become a
wasteland!

208
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:43,040
I won't let
that happen!

209
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,220
I will use all
my power to prevent it!

210
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:47,170
What?!

211
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:49,040
I love this planet...

212
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,010
...and everyone
on it.

213
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:53,140
The Earth is filled
with so many memories.

214
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:55,230
I can't let it
just disappear.

215
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,030
The people who live
here must be protected
at any cost.

216
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,110
This threat ends now!

217
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:05,000
You're in no condition
to use the Silver
Crystal!

218
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:06,020
She's right!

219
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,190
Sailor Moon!

220
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,200
You'll die!

221
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,220
Don't do it!

222
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:15,200
Your Silver Crystal is
no match for my
awesome power!

223
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:17,180
[various gasps]

224
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,170
[struggling breath]

225
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:49,220
[grunt]

226
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:54,090
[battle cry]

227
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,010
You're wasting
your time.

228
00:15:56,020 --> 00:16:02,140
Now that the Dark Gate
is open, the Silver
Crystal is powerless!

229
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:03,170
[groan]

230
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:04,140
She's too weak!

231
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:05,130
Sailor Moon!

232
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:06,180
We have to help!

233
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:07,140
But how?!

234
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:10,050
Usako!

235
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:10,517
[whimper]

236
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:18,020
I'm sorry!
It's my fault!

237
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:20,140
I'm the one who
caused all of this!

238
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:21,170
Chibi-Usa...

239
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,230
If it wasn't for
me you'd be safe!

240
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:30,160
What have I done?

241
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:33,170
What is this?

242
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:36,130
I see now...
The Silver Crystal!

243
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:38,000
It didn't disappear!

244
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:46,010
It became
a part of me!

245
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:47,110
What are you doing?

246
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:52,010
Listen, Mamo. I'm going
to use the Silver Crystal
to protect everyone.

247
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:55,120
Chibi-Usa, if you use
that Silver Crystal
you might die.

248
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:58,170
It doesn't matter. You
all risked your
lives to protect me.

249
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:02,010
Chibi-Usa...

250
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:06,030
Alright.
Then we're going
to help you
fight this thing!

251
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:08,210
Yes! It's all up
to us, we can't
afford to lose!

252
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:12,110
We made a vow to
protect this
beautiful planet!

253
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14,230
We're doing this
for all the people
who live here.

254
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,140
And to guarantee
their future!

255
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:20,010
Forget it!
You're wasting
your time!

256
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:23,110
[groaning in pain]

257
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,190
[heavy effort]

00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,180
[yelp of pain]

259
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:34,000
Please Silver Crystal,
I need the power to
protect everyone
that I love.

260
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:37,010
What?! A second
Silver Crystal?!

261
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:39,000
[gasp]
Chibi-Usa!

262
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:41,180
Give me your strength,
right now!

263
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:44,100
Mercury Star Power!

264
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:46,180
Mars Star Power!

265
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:49,100
Jupiter Star Power!

266
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:51,200
Venus Star Power!

267
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:58,210
Moon Crystal Power!

268
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:06,130
I won't succumb to
the power of the
Silver Crystal!

269
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:08,010
Evil power...

270
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:10,030
...Begone from this world!

271
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,200
[battle cry]

272
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:13,050
This can't be
happening!

273
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:18,090
I am Death Phantom!
The Ruler of Darkness!

274
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:31,160
What happened to us?

275
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:33,010
Did we die and
go to heaven?

276
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:39,130
Oh well. At least
we were able to
protect everyone,
right Chibi-Usa?

277
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:41,010
Uh-huh!

278
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:43,170
Listen to me, neither
of you are dead.

279
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:45,090
Huh?

280
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:49,190
The two Silver Crystals
answered your strong desires
of wanting to protect each
other...

281
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,160
...and brought
about a miracle.

282
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:52,190
Mommy?

283
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:57,020
Everyone is waiting for
you, it's time to go
back home.

284
00:18:57,030 --> 00:19:01,000
Usako, can you hear me?!
Talk to me!

285
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:02,160
Usako!

286
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:04,170
[soft sigh]
Mamo...

287
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:07,020
I'm right here.

288
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:08,020
Hey there.

289
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:10,020
[sounds of relief]

290
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,160
[gasp]
Chibi-Usa!

291
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:18,150
[soft breath]
Usagi?

292
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,140
I'm so relieved!

293
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:24,020
Chibi-Usa!

294
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,210
The dark power of
the Malefic Black
Crystal has vanished!

295
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:54,010
They did it!

296
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:57,110
The Sailor Guardians
saved both Earth and
Planet Nemesis!

297
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,030
Thank goodness!

298
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:08,190
[sighs of relief]

299
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:10,200
Thank you for everything!

300
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:14,100
Thank you, Chibi-Usa.
I guess it's time
for goodbye.

301
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:16,120
I'm gonna miss
you telling my
fortune.

302
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:18,100
Take good care
of yourself.

303
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:20,200
Thank you for helping
me with my homework.

304
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:23,180
Be sure and give our
best to the Sailor
Guardians in the future.

305
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:26,100
I won't forget about
all the good lunches
you made!

306
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:28,190
Will you remember
not to wet your bed?

307
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:31,000
Oh, those days are
so over!

308
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,110
But I'm gonna
miss playing
with you.

309
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:41,040
[nervous breath]

310
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:42,220
Go on, Usako.

311
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:53,010
[emotional breath]

312
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:55,110
[hesitant breath]

313
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,130
Usagi, it's
your turn
to say goodbye.

314
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:00,230
Usako...

Yahoo! Sailor Moon
is about to start
its third reason!

But before we do,
we have something
special for you.

Usagi, since it's our third
season, isn't it about
time someone else
played the lead?

What?! No way!

333

Moon...

Girls Resolve:
