doesn't understand. It's all
part of my plan.

81
00:06:48,725 --> 00:06:51,258
And just what plan
is that, hmm?

82
00:06:53,558 --> 00:06:57,125
Anyway, you'll be interested to
know that this time we're going
to go after a much younger,
fresher source of energy.

83
00:06:57,358 --> 00:07:01,092
Fresher energy? Great.

Come on! Let's help
her!

94
00:07:30,558 --> 00:07:33,325
Stop that! Didn't anyone
teach you how to be nice?

things to do, like find a
boyfriend for yourself, old

Uh-huh!

113
00:08:28,858 --> 00:08:31,392
Then you must like Sailor
Venus also, right?

114
00:08:31,425 --> 00:08:32,925
Never heard of her.

115
00:08:34,325 --> 00:08:36,558

something, Minako?

00:08:44,658 --> 00:08:46,425
Sure, go ahead.

119
00:08:46,725 --> 00:08:49,092
There is a Sailor
Moon, right?

120
00:08:49,658 --> 00:08:52,992
Hmm...That's kind of a
hard question to answer.

121
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:56,058
So she doesn't exist,
after all.

122
00:08:56,558 --> 00:08:59,992
No the opposite. You
believe she's real, don't you?

123
00:09:00,025 --> 00:09:01,392
Uh-huh!

124
00:09:02,825 --> 00:09:05,958
Then she does exist! Believing
is the most important thing you
can do.

125
00:09:06,358 --> 00:09:07,692
Then I will!

126
00:09:10,025 --> 00:09:12,692
Minako, have you ever
seen Sailor Moon?

127
00:09:13,092 --> 00:09:15,658
I've not only seen her,
I know her very well.

128

Uh-oh!

129
00:09:18,692 --> 00:09:23,258
Wow! Awesome! Can you come to
show-and-tell at my kindergarten
tomorrow and tell all the boys
that?

130
00:09:23,525 --> 00:09:25,992
Otherwise, no one will
believe me.

131
00:09:26,025 --> 00:09:27,258
Sure, I'll be there.

132
00:09:27,292 --> 00:09:28,358
Say what!

133
00:09:28,392 --> 00:09:29,425
You mean it?

134
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:33,692
I'll teach those big-mouthed
kids to believe in something
and make them be innocent again!

135
00:09:33,725 --> 00:09:35,658
Yeah! If they don't start
believing now...

136
00:09:37,392 --> 00:09:39,525
...they're going to regret it
when they grow up and yearn for
their lost innocence.

137
00:09:39,558 --> 00:09:40,292
Huh?

138
00:09:40,592 --> 00:09:41,558
Right?!

139
00:09:42,525 --> 00:09:44,558
Is it me or are
these kids very precocious?

140
00:09:45,092 --> 00:09:47,625
But they're kind of cute too.

141
00:09:53,692 --> 00:09:56,625
The situation's bad. Our
energy's run low.

142
00:09:57,425 --> 00:10:00,092
So what source are we
going to target this time?

exist.

If you believe hard enough,
then you'll meet them!

You should try to be more
realistic and rational.

experiencing some hard times?

they run off to play in their
own imaginary world.

189

Listen you brats. I'm normally a

this, I'm gonna get really

00:20:39,977 --> 00:20:42,710
Gigaros!

312
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:45,243
Finish it, Sailor Moon!

313
00:20:45,543 --> 00:20:47,010
Right!

314
00:21:04,477 --> 00:21:09,010
Moon Princess...!

315
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:12,410
Halation!

316
00:21:14,543 --> 00:21:17,443
Gigaros!

317
00:21:19,977 --> 00:21:22,343
Cleansing!

318

[Kids Cheering]

319
00:21:33,043 --> 00:21:38,210
Well done. You have discovered
the importance of believing in
yourself.

320
00:21:38,777 --> 00:21:39,910
Adieu.

321
00:21:41,043 --> 00:21:43,410
Crescent Beam Shower...

322
00:21:43,443 --> 00:21:44,443
That's right.

323
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:47,177
It's one of your
hidden powers.

324
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:49,743
That was awesome!

325
00:21:49,977 --> 00:21:52,210
I guess we have them
to thank for it.

326
00:21:53,543 --> 00:22:00,943
[Cheering]
All right! Yeah!
Sailor Moon!

327
00:22:01,877 --> 00:22:05,243
You're right. We won
because they believed in us.

328
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:08,277
Come on, let's go.
Everybody's waiting.

329
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:09,310
Hmm!

330

331
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:19,977
Minako, Sailor Moon was really
cool wasn't she?

332
00:22:20,277 --> 00:22:22,377
Yeah, she sure was!

333
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:29,043
You know what? Sailor Moon and
Sailor Venus were both cool! I
think I'm becoming a Sailor
Venus fan!

334
00:22:29,077 --> 00:22:31,443
And guess what guess what guess
what! There was also this
time...

335
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:11,243
Usagi, who's the
little cutie?!

336
00:24:11,743 --> 00:24:15,243
<i>[Giggling] It's me and</i>
<i>Mamoru's brand new</i>
<i>baby boy! Just kidding!</i>

337
00:24:15,276 --> 00:24:18,043
Wait, kidnapping is a
serious crime.

338
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:23,276
<i>We didn't steal him! The</i>
<i>baby's mom got sick so we're</i>
<i>taking care of him. Y'know, I</i>
<i>think he likes us!</i>

339
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:25,610
Because he relates to
your level of maturity.

340
00:24:25,643 --> 00:24:27,643
<i>Yup!</i>
<i>Hey, wait a minute!</i>
