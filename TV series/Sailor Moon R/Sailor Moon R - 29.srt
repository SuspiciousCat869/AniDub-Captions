Our Malefic Black Crystal
is invincible. So there's
really no point for us to

Who's that?!

57
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:31,992
I am not a threat
to any of you. I am
called Sailor Pluto.

00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:35,395
The Guardian who defends
the Door of Space and
Time.

please, you must
save Small Lady.

Small Lady?

66
00:06:51,544 --> 00:06:54,047
She must mean
Chibi-Usa...

67
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:59,219
The reason that she's
so weak is because the
Malefic Black Crystal
is attacking her mind.

68
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:03,790
If this assault on her
is allowed to continue,
her mind will fall apart.

69
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:06,226
There is only one
way to save her.

70
00:07:06,293 --> 00:07:10,230
You must enter her
subconscious mind and
stop the attack from
within.

71
00:07:10,297 --> 00:07:12,165
Doing this will
be dangerous.

72
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:15,135
But that's the only
way to help Chibi-
Usa recover?

00:13:15,495 --> 00:13:17,063
I don't wanna
hear it!

160
00:13:17,163 --> 00:13:20,066
Take it easy, we came
here because we want
to help you.

161
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:22,635
What are you talking
about? You and your
stupid friends are the

162
00:13:22,669 --> 00:13:25,104
ones who made a huge
mess of Crystal Tokyo!

163
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:26,139
What d'you mean
by that?

164
00:13:26,172 --> 00:13:29,175
You and the rest of
the Black Moon Clan
did it!

165
00:13:29,609 --> 00:13:33,179
You did this to
Crystal Tokyo
and my mommy!

166
00:13:34,047 --> 00:13:36,316
You created this
whole problem!

167
00:13:36,349 --> 00:13:39,285
That's not true.
You've got it
all wrong.

168
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:41,187
Really! We're
not your enemy.

169
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,188
You're lying!

170
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:43,556
No I'm not!

171
00:13:44,957 --> 00:13:48,294
We came here for only
one purpose, and that's
for us to protect you.

172
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:51,331
You're here to
protect me?

173
00:13:51,364 --> 00:13:56,669
That's right. Me and my
friends are the Sailor
Guardians of justice.
And we're on your side!

174
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:00,707
I know this'll be hard
to believe, but you're
going to travel back in

175
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:04,344
time to the 20th century
and become great friends
with us.

176
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:05,712
We'll be friends?

177
00:14:07,714 --> 00:14:10,683
What're you talking
about?! That's stupid!

178
00:14:11,117 --> 00:14:12,418
Trust me...

179
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,556
Since I don't have much
of a choice, I'll trust
you for now.

180
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:17,256
[gasp]

181
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:18,057
Really?!

182
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:21,194
Prove it to me,
go save my mommy.

183
00:14:21,227 --> 00:14:22,428
Your mom?

184
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:32,171
Amazing...

185
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:36,943
That is the Crystal
Palace. My mommy's
sleeping in there.

186
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:40,446
Then let's go to her!

187
00:14:41,114 --> 00:14:42,014
[gasp]

188
00:14:42,682 --> 00:14:43,516
Wait a second!

189
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:44,183
Hm?

190
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:51,023
What was that?

191
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:53,226
It's the Malefic
Black Crystal.

192
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:53,726
Huh?

193
00:14:55,595 --> 00:15:00,266
My Mommy warned me. She
said our enemies have this
evil crystal and can use
it's power against us.

194
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:02,435
But still, you
have to save her!

195
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:03,136
[gasp]

196
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:05,605
Are you too scared?

197
00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:08,775
Then you must be lying
about being my friend.

198
00:15:09,142 --> 00:15:09,742
[gasp]

199
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:13,413
What's that?

200
00:15:13,513 --> 00:15:14,447
Sailor Moon!

201
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,316
The other Guardians
are in trouble!

202
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:19,252
Alright then. I'll
be right there.

203
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:22,355
Chibi-usa, don't worry.
We'll save your mommy.

204
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:24,757
I promise you we
will find a way!

205
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:27,627
You two stay here and
keep an eye on Chibi-
Usa!

206
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:28,261
Sure!

207
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,432
Sailor Moon...

208
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:37,737
[evil chuckling]

209
00:15:41,407 --> 00:15:44,977
[growls]

210
00:15:45,011 --> 00:15:46,412
Hey! I'm back!

211
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:48,014
Sailor Moon?!

212
00:15:50,016 --> 00:15:55,087
Listen everyone, it seems
that Chibi-Usa's mother is
being held captive somewhere
in that Crystal Palace.

213
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:55,988
What?!

214
00:15:57,757 --> 00:16:00,726
If we can rescue her,
that just might be the
key to making Chibi-Usa
well again!

215
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,494
Mhm!

216
00:16:01,594 --> 00:16:03,162
Then let's get to it!

217
00:16:04,931 --> 00:16:07,400
Well it's not going to
be easy because there's
a force field around the
whole palace.

218
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:09,469
[chuckling]

219
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:10,803
Well we've gotta
do something.

220
00:16:10,837 --> 00:16:13,172
Looks like we will have
to defeat this guy first!

221
00:16:13,206 --> 00:16:16,309
[chuckling]

222
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:17,810
That won't be
easy either...

223
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:20,580
Our attacks haven't
had any affect on
this creep.

224
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:22,815
Well we've gotta beat
him but what's our
plan?

225
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:27,253
[gasp]

226
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:29,522
[growling]

227
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,992
[screaming]

228
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,302
[groaning]

229
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:44,704
I won't quit...

230
00:16:44,804 --> 00:16:47,173
Then I'll put an end
to your suffering.

231
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:49,976
[nervous breaths]

232
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:53,479
Chibi-Usa, please!
You must open your
heart to all of us!

233
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:57,717
[whimpering]

234
00:17:02,555 --> 00:17:04,056
[screaming]

235
00:17:05,725 --> 00:17:07,793
Sailor Moon!

236
00:17:08,394 --> 00:17:11,564
So there you
are, Rabbit...

237
00:17:12,732 --> 00:17:14,166
Run away, Chibi-Usa!

238
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:16,536
Now, let's go home!

239
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:18,437
Sailor Moon!

240
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:19,705
Chibi-Usa!

241
00:17:20,273 --> 00:17:22,308
Oh no! Look out!

242
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,243
[screaming]

243
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:39,959
[screaming]

244
00:17:42,762 --> 00:17:46,299
[grunting]

245
00:17:46,332 --> 00:17:48,200
Sailor Moon...

246
00:17:48,701 --> 00:17:51,537
Chibi-Usa, are
you all right?

247
00:17:52,204 --> 00:17:54,206
Why did you save me?

248
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:57,243
I told you, because
I'm your friend.

249
00:17:57,276 --> 00:17:57,944
Agh!

250
00:17:59,045 --> 00:18:01,180
[grunting]

251
00:18:01,213 --> 00:18:05,318
It's okay. You've done
enough already! You
can let go.

252
00:18:05,351 --> 00:18:07,486
No way, I could
never do that.

253
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:12,024
We all came here so
that we could save you,
and that's what I'm gonna
do.

254
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:13,626
[gasp]

255
00:18:17,363 --> 00:18:20,366
Don't cry, Small Lady.
The Sailor Guardians

256
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:23,769
will always come to
your rescue. I promise...

257
00:18:25,037 --> 00:18:29,508
Hey, Mr. Tuxedo Mask,
is Sailor Moon very
strong?

258
00:18:29,542 --> 00:18:33,045
Yes, she's invincible.

259
00:18:36,382 --> 00:18:40,686
Sailor Moon, are you
really invincible?

260
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:44,724
As long as you continue
to have faith in me,
Chibi-Usa, then I'll

261
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,326
become as strong as
you want me to be.

262
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:50,630
Come on Rabbit, let's
go home to mommy.

263
00:18:50,663 --> 00:18:53,466
Kick that guy's
butt, Sailor Moon.

264
00:18:53,566 --> 00:18:54,533
[growling]

265
00:18:54,567 --> 00:18:55,668
[grunting]

266
00:18:58,104 --> 00:18:59,438
[groaning]

267
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:03,009
[grunting]

268
00:19:03,109 --> 00:19:05,011
[screaming]

269
00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:13,019
Sailor Moon!

270
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:14,286
[giggling]

271
00:19:15,855 --> 00:19:19,725
Knock it off! I won't
let you have it your
way anymore! You're
done here!

272
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:20,626
What?!

273
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:45,518
Moon Princess Halation!

274
00:19:50,122 --> 00:19:53,359
[screaming]

275
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:00,299
[sigh]

276
00:20:01,067 --> 00:20:01,967
[chuckle]

277
00:20:24,523 --> 00:20:27,393
So that must be Chibi-
Usa's mom in there.

278
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:29,128
Sailor Moon...

279
00:20:29,195 --> 00:20:29,962
Huh?

280
00:20:30,262 --> 00:20:31,630
Thanks a lot...

281
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:39,438
Thank you for keeping
your promise. Because
of you, I'll be fine.

282
00:20:44,677 --> 00:20:48,214
Don't forget that we'll
always be there to help
you when you need it!

283
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,014
Yeah!

284
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:02,428
Looks like we
made it back home.

285
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:07,433
Thank you for all
you've done, Sailor
Moon.

286
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:08,400
Mmm?

287
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:11,270
Huh?

288
00:21:12,471 --> 00:21:14,774
Thank you,
all of you.

289
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:18,511
Sailor Pluto, will
Chibi-Usa be all
right now?

290
00:21:18,577 --> 00:21:19,779
Mm-hm.

291
00:21:26,085 --> 00:21:27,453
Whatta good nap...

292
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:31,190
We really did it!
Chibi-Usa's well
again!

293
00:21:31,423 --> 00:21:32,691
Puu?

294
00:21:36,595 --> 00:21:39,999
Puu, I wanna go
back to the future?

295
00:21:40,099 --> 00:21:42,568
In your current state,
that's still not possible.

296
00:21:42,601 --> 00:21:43,402
Huh?

297
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:47,306
Small Lady, the enemy
will soon be attacking
the 20th century once

298
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:49,108
again and you must
be ready for them.

299
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:54,013
Keep in mind that by
defending this place
and time, you're also
defending our future.

300
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:59,084
Sailor Guardians,
please protect
Small Lady...

301
00:21:59,084 --> 00:22:02,321
...and make sure you
hold onto the Silver
Crystal.

302
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:07,426
Wait! How do you know
so much about us?!

303
00:22:07,493 --> 00:22:08,594
Puu!

304
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:15,234
[whimpering]

305
00:22:15,301 --> 00:22:16,502
Chibi-Usa...

306
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:20,706
[crying]

307
00:22:23,209 --> 00:22:31,584
I will protect Chibi-Usa
and the Silver Crystal...
And the future that's yet
to come... I promise...

308
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:13,819
There's nothing like a
sweet and delicious cake
buffet to melt a young
girl's heart!

309
00:24:13,852 --> 00:24:15,321
[mocking chuckle]

310
00:24:15,354 --> 00:24:17,489
You girls spend more
time eating than taking
care of how you look!

311
00:24:17,523 --> 00:24:19,491
And who are you?!

312
00:24:19,491 --> 00:24:23,862
I am Green Esmeraude.
Perhaps you'd like to
taste a sample of my
terrifying Dark Power!

313
00:24:23,896 --> 00:24:27,466
No way! My cute body is
turning into a big chunk
of sugar!

314
00:24:27,866 --> 00:24:33,038
Next time on Sailor Moon R:
"Magic of Darkness:
Esmeraude's Invasion."

315
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:36,008
The moonlight is a
messenger of love.
