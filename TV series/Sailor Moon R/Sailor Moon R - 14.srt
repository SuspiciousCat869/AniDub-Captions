1
00:01:57,313 --> 00:02:02,213
Hey, who is this little
girl? Why does she have
the same name and
hairstyle as me?! And

2
00:02:02,246 --> 00:02:07,213
where did she come from
anyway? Wait, you're
after the Silver Crystal?
That means you're an

3
00:02:07,246 --> 00:02:12,446
enemy! Well, you can act
all cute and innocent,
but you can't fool me
because I am Sailor Moon!

4
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:15,446
And in the name of the
Moon.. I'll punish you!

5
00:02:33,313 --> 00:02:34,546
[snickering]

6
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:44,346
Master Rubeus. Is this
area the Tokyo Juban
District?

7
00:02:44,379 --> 00:02:49,279
Yes. And just as I
thought, the whole place
appears to be
under-developed.

8
00:02:49,313 --> 00:02:53,346
Great! Then let's go
find the Silver Crystal
so we can destroy it.

9
00:02:53,379 --> 00:02:55,779
There's really no need to
rush, Koan.

10
00:02:55,813 --> 00:02:56,313
But, sir...

11
00:02:56,346 --> 00:02:57,713
<i>He's right...</i>

12
00:02:57,746 --> 00:03:00,846
I think our very first
order of business is to
hunt down the Rabbit.

13
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,779
We can worry about
the Silver Crystal
later.

14
00:03:02,813 --> 00:03:05,213
[chuckling]
Good suggestion.

15
00:03:05,246 --> 00:03:09,813
All right. Let's make
finding that Rabbit and
getting rid of her our
primary goal.

Mamo, tell me.. Will we
always be together, from
now on?

18
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:43,613
Yes, we will, Usako.

19
00:03:43,646 --> 00:03:47,779
This is the happiest
moment of my life!

20
00:03:47,813 --> 00:03:51,646
[chuckling]
You're being a little
dramatic, Usako.

21
00:03:53,313 --> 00:03:55,446
Watch your step...

00:03:57,813 --> 00:03:59,746

Hm??

[gasping]

30
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:47,646
Y-You there! Just what
do you think you're
doing?! Why are you
hugging my Mamo?!

31
00:04:47,679 --> 00:04:49,179
"Mamo"?

32
00:04:50,446 --> 00:04:53,179
Hey! Back off! Get away
from my man!

33
00:04:57,246 --> 00:05:02,413
Who are you? Just where
did you come from,
anyway?

34
00:05:02,446 --> 00:05:03,846
I am Usagi.

35
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:05,246
Huh?!

36
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:06,446
"Usagi"?

37
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:07,613
Who are you supposed
to be?

38
00:05:07,646 --> 00:05:10,779
And why are you wearing
your hair in my bun-head
style?

39
00:05:10,813 --> 00:05:13,213
What do you mean your
bun-head style?!

40
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:17,713
I'm the one and only
bun-head! Me, Usagi
Tsukino, got that?!

41
00:05:19,313 --> 00:05:22,379
<i>You're Usagi Tsukino?</i>

42
00:05:24,313 --> 00:05:26,513
If you are who you say
you are...

43
00:05:27,946 --> 00:05:30,679
...then you must possess
the Silver Crystal.

44
00:05:30,713 --> 00:05:33,479
So... hand it over
right now.

45
00:05:33,513 --> 00:05:37,446
Hey, come on. That's a
toy gun and this is just
a joke, right?

46
00:05:37,479 --> 00:05:41,779
<i>Stay right where you are,</i>
<i>mister! If you move, this</i>
<i>girl dies!</i>

47
00:05:41,813 --> 00:05:44,613
Now give me.. the Silver
Crystal.

48
00:05:44,646 --> 00:05:48,546
What? What do you mean?
I don't know what you're
talking about.

49
00:05:48,579 --> 00:05:52,479
Don't try to fool with
me! I already know you
have the Silver Crystal,

50
00:05:52,513 --> 00:05:54,446
so stop pretending
that you don't.

51
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:58,579
Look.. I'm not pretending.
You can continue to threaten
me with that toy,

52
00:05:58,613 --> 00:06:00,646
but I don't know what
I don't know.

53
00:06:00,679 --> 00:06:05,279
So.. You've decided to
tough it out by playing
dumb.

54
00:06:05,313 --> 00:06:06,679
Big mistake...

It was a toy! But it
sure sounded real.

60
00:06:16,346 --> 00:06:18,713
Hey! Your joke went too
far!

61
00:06:19,813 --> 00:06:21,479
Where'd she go?

62
00:06:23,813 --> 00:06:25,646
<i>I'm home.</i>

63
00:06:27,446 --> 00:06:32,779
Who in the world was
that girl? She ruined

What's the matter,
Usagi?

00:06:45,746 --> 00:06:47,679
Shingo! Fess up!

69
00:06:50,746 --> 00:06:54,413
You trashed my room and
tore everything to
shreds, didn't you?!

70
00:06:54,446 --> 00:06:56,313
What the heck are you
talking about?

71
00:06:56,346 --> 00:06:58,846
Don't you play
dumb with me!

What are you doing in the
middle of my house?

74
00:07:08,246 --> 00:07:09,879
She came down from the
sky?

75
00:07:09,913 --> 00:07:11,846
Yeah. It's the only
explanation.

76
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:17,613
But there's another
puzzling factor. She knew
about the existence of the
Silver Crystal, as well.

77
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:19,213
Mamo...

78
00:07:19,246 --> 00:07:20,713
It'll be all right.

79
00:07:20,746 --> 00:07:21,813
You have me.

80
00:07:23,346 --> 00:07:26,446
Your little cousin Usagi
will be staying here with
us for the time being.

81
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:31,613
This girl is tricking
you! She isn't who you
think she is at all!!

82
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:36,913
Don't be silly. What are
you talking about?

83
00:07:36,946 --> 00:07:39,279
Usagi's always saying
stupid stuff!

84
00:07:39,313 --> 00:07:42,746
We don't even have
a cousin! Who's saying
stupid stuff now?!

00:07:42,779 --> 00:07:45,779
Boy, Usagi. You've really
lost it this time.

Huh?! What's this? No
way!

87
00:07:57,746 --> 00:08:00,613
She came to visit us
during the New Years.
Don't you remember?

88
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:09,313
[growling and screaming]
This is totally
ridiculous!

89

Usagi. Calm down.

90
00:08:11,946 --> 00:08:15,413
Yeah Usagi, you should
calm down.

91

Who is that manipulative
little girl, anyway?!

93
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:29,913
I don't know. By the time
I came back, everyone one
was acting like they've
known her for years.

94
00:08:29,946 --> 00:08:32,779
Those pictures were
somehow manipulated and
slipped into the album!

95
00:08:32,813 --> 00:08:37,579
You're probably right.
And she had to have used
some kind of strange
energy to alter your

96
00:08:37,613 --> 00:08:39,746
family's memories, to
accept her.

97
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:44,513
She's also after the
Silver Crystal! Luna,
what do we do?

98
00:08:44,546 --> 00:08:48,313
For now, let's wait and
see until we can learn
more about this girl.

99
00:08:48,346 --> 00:08:53,246
But that's gonna take
like, forever. I say we
need to act before things
get much worse.

be clean...

of something.

Tokyo all by herself
because her parents are
too busy to watch her.

00:10:15,579 --> 00:10:17,446
She's just frightened
and lonely.

long as that Crystal

134
00:10:54,313 --> 00:11:00,646
exists.. we will be
unable to destroy the
despicable Crystal Tokyo.

00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:05,646
Lord Wiseman, tell us.
Is the Silver Crystal
really here in the Juban

00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:10,179
Yes. You must trust my

future.

137
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:17,646
Without fail, I'll find
the Silver Crystal and

photo. Sorry, Usagi!

152
00:12:21,168 --> 00:12:24,301
<i>What? Are you sure?</i>

153
00:12:24,335 --> 00:12:29,101
So... It looks like those
girls are Usagi Tsukino's
best friends.

154
00:12:29,768 --> 00:12:33,368
Maybe she got one of them
to keep the Silver
Crystal for her.

155
00:12:33,801 --> 00:12:39,135
[humming]

156
00:12:39,168 --> 00:12:41,101
Uh-Oh!

157
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:45,868
What a surprise! Hi
there, little girl. What
brings you here?

158
00:12:45,901 --> 00:12:46,435
Uh!

159
00:12:46,468 --> 00:12:50,701
Luna P! Transform!

160
00:12:54,868 --> 00:12:58,868
Ah! That was a very
impressive trick!

161
00:12:58,901 --> 00:12:59,768
Huh?

162
00:13:01,268 --> 00:13:05,468
Agh, don't do that! It's
not coffee! You can't add
milk, it'll ruin them!

163
00:13:05,501 --> 00:13:06,935
I'm not adding
milk to them!

164
00:13:06,968 --> 00:13:07,801
Huh?

165
00:13:07,835 --> 00:13:09,835
[grunting]

166
00:13:11,568 --> 00:13:16,101
I told you it wasn't
milk. I guess when you
wake up, you'll realize
I wasn't lying.

167
00:13:18,835 --> 00:13:23,235
Ugh. This is so odd that
you didn't sense anything
at all...

168
00:13:23,268 --> 00:13:26,401
Ya sure that spiritual
power of yours is working,
Rei?

169
00:13:26,435 --> 00:13:28,801
It's solid! How dare you!

170
00:13:28,835 --> 00:13:32,301
Usagi, maybe you're
reading too much into
this situation.

171
00:13:32,335 --> 00:13:34,401
Huh?

172
00:13:34,435 --> 00:13:38,468
Yeah. We've taken care of
all the incidents that came
up and things are going well
now with you and Mamoru.

173
00:13:38,501 --> 00:13:39,435
Uh--

174
00:13:39,468 --> 00:13:40,968
There really isn't
anything keeping you
busy,

175
00:13:41,001 --> 00:13:44,701
so maybe you're
overcompensating for
boredom and looking
for some excitement.

176
00:13:44,735 --> 00:13:45,801
No, I'm not!

177
00:13:45,835 --> 00:13:47,368
Are you sure?

178
00:13:47,401 --> 00:13:51,968
Usagi... Maybe it's time
to pursue the one thing
that should really excite
us.

179
00:13:52,001 --> 00:13:53,268
Yeah? What's that?

180
00:13:53,301 --> 00:13:57,001
Well, we middle-schoolers
want to go to high
school, so...

181
00:13:57,035 --> 00:14:02,768
... that means...
we should all study!

182
00:14:02,801 --> 00:14:04,201
[groaning]

183
00:14:04,235 --> 00:14:07,735
Next time, give a warning
before hitting us over
the head with reality.

184
00:14:07,768 --> 00:14:08,868
[chuckling]

185
00:14:10,135 --> 00:14:12,401
<i>Hello! You girls are all</i>
<i>looking as cute as ever!</i>

186
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:15,135
Which one of you would
like to go out on a date
with me?

187
00:14:15,168 --> 00:14:17,435
Not that again,
grandpa, we're busy
right now!

188
00:14:17,468 --> 00:14:20,435
You don't have to be so
nasty. It can't hurt to
try.

189
00:14:20,468 --> 00:14:24,435
And I brought all of you
your favorite, Juban Hot
Spring Manju.

190
00:14:24,468 --> 00:14:28,668
Okay, okay. Just leave
them there and be on your
way. Thank you!

191
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:31,301
Throwing me out. How
inhospitable.

192
00:14:31,335 --> 00:14:35,835
I never thought my own
grand-daughter would
treat her poor, elderly
grandpa so callously. It

193
00:14:35,868 --> 00:14:38,068
makes me sad. So, so
sad...

194
00:14:38,101 --> 00:14:39,768
For crying out loud!

195
00:14:39,801 --> 00:14:44,368
If anyone's sad, it
should be me. I'm the one
whose grandpa refuses to
act his own age,

196
00:14:44,401 --> 00:14:46,301
and is always
hitting on young
girls.

197
00:14:46,335 --> 00:14:49,201
Yeah, but he's got
good Manju!

198
00:14:52,868 --> 00:14:54,135
Hm?

199
00:14:54,168 --> 00:14:58,201
What's the matter? Aren't
you all gonna have some?

200
00:14:58,235 --> 00:14:59,201
Is there enough?

201
00:14:59,235 --> 00:15:00,668
Ehh--

202
00:15:07,235 --> 00:15:09,168
[savoring]

203
00:15:09,201 --> 00:15:09,901
Hm?!

204
00:15:13,468 --> 00:15:18,001
What happened to
everyone? Rei? Huh?

205
00:15:18,035 --> 00:15:20,101
[humming]

206
00:15:21,335 --> 00:15:24,701
Ah-ha! I see the sleeping
drug took effect..

207
00:15:24,735 --> 00:15:25,835
[laughing]

208
00:15:29,835 --> 00:15:33,301
Now then... Time to start
looking for the Silver
Crystal.

209
00:15:33,335 --> 00:15:34,135
[gasping]

210
00:15:38,435 --> 00:15:41,801
Too bad for you! I didn't
drink the spiked tea!

211
00:15:41,835 --> 00:15:42,801
[gasping]

212
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:46,268
How dare you drug all
my friends! It's
unforgivable!

213
00:15:46,301 --> 00:15:47,235
[grunting]

214
00:15:47,268 --> 00:15:48,901
Exactly who are you?

215
00:15:48,935 --> 00:15:53,101
...Where did you come
from? And finally, why
are you looking for the
Silver Crystal?!

216
00:15:53,135 --> 00:15:55,435
[whimpering]

217
00:15:55,468 --> 00:15:56,035
Tell me!

218
00:15:56,068 --> 00:15:57,935
[crying]

219
00:15:57,968 --> 00:16:00,101
You can cry, but I won't
forgive you.

220
00:16:00,135 --> 00:16:04,901
[crying]

221
00:16:04,935 --> 00:16:07,001
Huh?! What's going on?

222
00:16:13,235 --> 00:16:16,401
Hmmm.

223
00:16:16,435 --> 00:16:17,935
Huh?

224
00:16:19,835 --> 00:16:21,435
It's her.

225
00:16:21,468 --> 00:16:29,201
[crying]

226
00:16:29,235 --> 00:16:31,968
What exactly are you?!

227
00:16:32,001 --> 00:16:36,735
[chuckling]
Looks like I've found
you... Little Rabbit.

228
00:16:39,235 --> 00:16:41,368
I've been looking all
over for you.

229
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:43,435
[gasping]

230
00:16:43,468 --> 00:16:46,201
Now that I've got you,
it's time to get rid of
you.

231
00:16:46,235 --> 00:16:50,201
Wait a minute. Stop right
there! Who are you?!

232
00:16:50,235 --> 00:16:51,801
Who am I?

233
00:16:51,835 --> 00:16:55,435
I'm the youngest of the
four Spectre Sisters...
Koan.

234
00:16:55,468 --> 00:16:57,401
You're like an
oversized crow!

235
00:16:57,435 --> 00:16:59,835
Well, you're
in my way.

236
00:16:59,868 --> 00:17:01,735
You'll die first!

237
00:17:03,868 --> 00:17:05,701
Ahhhh!

238
00:17:06,901 --> 00:17:09,035
Rei's manga collection!

239
00:17:09,068 --> 00:17:09,901
[chuckling]

240
00:17:09,935 --> 00:17:12,101
[gasping]

241
00:17:12,135 --> 00:17:14,101
You're not getting away!

242
00:17:14,135 --> 00:17:14,968
Hey!

243
00:17:16,401 --> 00:17:19,801
I don't know who you are,
but you seem like an evil
person. So...

244
00:17:19,835 --> 00:17:24,201
Moon Crystal
Power! Make Up!

245
00:18:04,335 --> 00:18:08,035
Ahhhh!

246
00:18:09,135 --> 00:18:11,735
You're fast. No wonder
they call you The Rabbit.

247
00:18:11,768 --> 00:18:15,701
Help me... Daddy...
Mommy... [sighing]

248
00:18:16,835 --> 00:18:18,701
Heh. Prayers won't
help you.

249
00:18:18,735 --> 00:18:19,401
<i>Stop right there!</i>

250
00:18:19,435 --> 00:18:20,268
[gasping]

251
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:24,668
Well, now. Who are you?

252
00:18:25,468 --> 00:18:29,168
I am the Pretty Guardian
who fights for love and
for justice!

253
00:18:29,201 --> 00:18:31,135
I am Sailor Moon!

254
00:18:31,168 --> 00:18:33,035
Can't say I'm impressed.

255
00:18:33,068 --> 00:18:36,668
You're an evil villainess
who has threatened to
take a young girl's life.

256
00:18:37,468 --> 00:18:41,101
So, now, in the name
of the moon, I'll
punish you!

257
00:18:41,901 --> 00:18:43,401
Yeah? Whatever.

258
00:18:48,235 --> 00:18:49,268
Ah!

259
00:18:50,835 --> 00:18:51,468
[gasping]

260
00:18:51,501 --> 00:18:54,168
Dark... Fire!

261
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:59,968
[panicking]

262
00:19:01,735 --> 00:19:02,201
[gasping]

263
00:19:06,168 --> 00:19:09,068
Get ready to roast,
Rabbit!

264
00:19:09,335 --> 00:19:10,301
[grunting]

265
00:19:10,335 --> 00:19:13,235
Sailor Body Attack!

266
00:19:13,268 --> 00:19:15,068
[grunting]

267
00:19:20,935 --> 00:19:23,901
How dare you rub my fine
face in dirt!

268
00:19:23,935 --> 00:19:24,935
Die!

269
00:19:27,235 --> 00:19:29,001
Who did that?

270
00:19:29,468 --> 00:19:32,468
The bright flames of
passion are noble and
lovely...

271
00:19:32,501 --> 00:19:36,368
But the evil
dark flames of murder are
ugly and despicable.

272
00:19:40,068 --> 00:19:41,935
Tuxedo Mask, thank
goodness!

273
00:19:42,168 --> 00:19:44,801
I'll incinerate both of
you, and the Rabbit!

274
00:19:44,835 --> 00:19:46,835
<i>I'm not going to</i>
<i>allow that!</i>

275
00:19:46,868 --> 00:19:47,768
Huh?

276
00:20:06,335 --> 00:20:10,701
Moon Princess...

277
00:20:10,735 --> 00:20:13,035
...Halation!

278
00:20:16,368 --> 00:20:17,901
Ahhh!

279
00:20:22,735 --> 00:20:24,135
I did it!

280
00:20:24,168 --> 00:20:25,567
<i>Sailor Moon!</i>

281
00:20:25,567 --> 00:20:26,735
How did you?!

282
00:20:26,768 --> 00:20:29,068
Mark my words, I'll get
you for this!

283
00:20:31,001 --> 00:20:33,468
It appears we have
a new enemy.

284
00:20:33,501 --> 00:20:36,068
Thank you, Tuxedo Mask!

285
00:20:36,101 --> 00:20:40,901
My pleasure. But what's
going on? Why would
anyone want to destroy
her?

286
00:20:40,935 --> 00:20:42,968
[sleepily moaning]

287
00:20:43,001 --> 00:20:44,101
Uh?

288
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:03,301
<i>Tuxedo Mask?!</i>

289
00:21:03,335 --> 00:21:05,901
Huh?

290
00:21:05,935 --> 00:21:07,301
Something wrong?

291
00:21:07,335 --> 00:21:09,801
No. It's nothing.

292
00:21:09,835 --> 00:21:12,235
Did I just have some sort
of vision?

293
00:21:12,835 --> 00:21:15,935
So warm... Like Daddy...

294
00:21:22,468 --> 00:21:25,368
What? Did you say Sailor
Moon?

295
00:21:25,401 --> 00:21:29,935
Yes. And a stupidly dressed
guy she referred to as
Tuxedo Mask.

296
00:21:29,968 --> 00:21:35,135
Huh. This interference
is quite unexpected...

297
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:36,601
Be that as it may...

298
00:21:36,635 --> 00:21:39,035
We know the Silver
Crystal and the Rabbit are
somewhere in this town.

299
00:21:39,068 --> 00:21:42,001
In time, both will
be in our possession.

300
00:21:42,035 --> 00:21:45,801
And then I will crush
them for you, sir.

301
00:21:45,835 --> 00:21:51,435
Sailor Moon. I'll make you
pay for messing up my face,
if it's the last thing I do.

302
00:21:58,001 --> 00:22:02,468
Hmm... Seems like she's
been through some sad,
tough times.

303
00:22:02,501 --> 00:22:04,968
Hey, little Usagi...

304
00:22:05,001 --> 00:22:08,401
If you tell us
everything, I'm sure we'll
be able to help you out.

305
00:22:13,468 --> 00:22:18,801
[sleeping sounds]

306
00:24:10,973 --> 00:24:16,439
Mamo! Just being with you
makes my life so happy.

307
00:24:16,473 --> 00:24:18,773
<i>Will you please stop</i>

00:24:25,806 --> 00:24:26,739
What?
