Is love something that
can die?

The sad voice crying
for help.

against the Dark Kingdom?

How you would always
show up just in time to

Huh?!

258
00:13:28,871 --> 00:13:33,038
Don't you get it? Love
is something that is
built together.

259
00:13:33,071 --> 00:13:34,871
By caring for
each other.

Hm?!

263

When you truly love
someone, the strength of
that love gives you the

270
00:14:00,238 --> 00:14:04,638
Our pain comes from us
wandering the entire
universe all alone
for so long,

00:14:04,671 --> 00:14:07,538
with no one ever

hadn't done that, we never
would've survived!

Nothing good comes out
of stealing. It only

strength and wits to keep

329
00:18:09,605 --> 00:18:12,538
<i>Makai Tree... You poor</i>
thing.

330
00:18:13,405 --> 00:18:18,438
<i>You kept thinking energy</i>

<i>what I need is love.</i>

331
00:18:18,671 --> 00:18:19,838
Love.

332
00:18:20,805 --> 00:18:22,805
<i>I made myself wither and</i>

333

334
00:18:28,671 --> 00:18:30,405
Forgive us.

335
00:18:30,438 --> 00:18:35,905
<i>All is well. In the</i>
<i>end, you have finally</i>
<i>learned what true love is.</i>

336
00:18:35,938 --> 00:18:40,138
<i>Love is about caring for</i>
<i>one another...</i>

337
00:18:40,171 --> 00:18:41,138
An.

338
00:18:41,171 --> 00:18:43,605
[crying]

339
00:18:43,638 --> 00:18:45,205
<i>Sailor Moon... please.</i>

340
00:18:45,238 --> 00:18:46,405
Huh?

341
00:18:48,105 --> 00:18:52,438
<i>Would you please purify</i>
<i>my body and spirit with</i>
<i>your power of love?</i>

342
00:18:52,471 --> 00:18:53,338
Yes.

343
00:19:12,938 --> 00:19:16,871
Moon Princess...

344
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:19,405
Halation!

345
00:19:23,005 --> 00:19:29,338
<i>Cleansing!</i>

346
00:19:35,305 --> 00:19:37,338
<i>The Makai Tree</i>
disappeared.

347
00:19:37,371 --> 00:19:39,338
<i>It's going to be</i>
<i>reborn.</i>

348
00:19:39,371 --> 00:19:40,405
Huh?

349
00:19:40,438 --> 00:19:42,971
Moonlight Knight, you're
all right!

350
00:19:43,005 --> 00:19:45,438
Sailor Moon... I mean,
Usagi Tsukino.

351
00:19:45,471 --> 00:19:47,371
How do you know my
name?!

352
00:19:47,405 --> 00:19:51,071
Now is the time I will
reveal my true identity
to you.

353
00:19:52,638 --> 00:19:53,938
<i>[gasping]</i>

354
00:19:53,971 --> 00:19:55,505
Mamoru?!

355
00:19:55,538 --> 00:19:57,271
But Mamoru, there are
two of you?!

356
00:19:57,305 --> 00:20:00,271
That's right. You see,
I am another Mamoru.

357
00:20:00,305 --> 00:20:02,338
I don't understand!

358
00:20:02,371 --> 00:20:05,171
After your final battle
against Queen Beryl,

359
00:20:05,205 --> 00:20:07,605
Mamoru's memories were
taken from him.

360
00:20:08,371 --> 00:20:11,338
But there was something
that couldn't be wiped
away.

361
00:20:11,371 --> 00:20:17,038
His resolve to protect
the girl he cared for,
Sailor Moon or rather
Usagi Tsukino, still

362
00:20:17,071 --> 00:20:18,871
remained quite strong.

363
00:20:18,905 --> 00:20:25,605
And that desire was so
deep that it took on a
life of its own, and
created the Moonlight Knight.

364
00:20:25,638 --> 00:20:28,338
His only mission was to
protect you.

365
00:20:28,371 --> 00:20:29,505
Oh, Mamoru!

366
00:20:31,371 --> 00:20:35,105
But my mission has come
to an end. Now that Mamoru
has fallen in love with you
once more,

367
00:20:35,138 --> 00:20:40,971
he and I will become
one again, protecting you
always, as we stay by
your side.

368
00:20:41,238 --> 00:20:43,538
<i>Huh?</i>

369
00:20:43,571 --> 00:20:44,238
Adieu.

370
00:20:44,538 --> 00:20:47,405

372
00:20:54,471 --> 00:20:59,505
Sailor Moon
Moon. Sailor Moon--

373
00:20:59,538 --> 00:21:01,071
Huh?!

374
00:21:01,105 --> 00:21:04,971
Ma-Mamoru, it's you!

375
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:06,938
Sailor Moon.

376
00:21:07,938 --> 00:21:10,971
Usagi. The little
Miss Bun-Head.

377
00:21:11,005 --> 00:21:14,938
It's really back! Your
memory! It's come back!

378
00:21:15,405 --> 00:21:23,038
You're back! I'm so
happy Mamoru! Mamoru!

379
00:21:23,071 --> 00:21:24,071
[gasping]

380
00:21:24,105 --> 00:21:27,171
Uh--

381
00:21:27,205 --> 00:21:28,071
An!

382
00:21:30,338 --> 00:21:31,638
Ail!

383
00:21:31,671 --> 00:21:33,438
You came back to
life!

384
00:21:33,971 --> 00:21:34,938
An!!!

385
00:21:34,971 --> 00:21:36,071
Ail!

386
00:21:37,371 --> 00:21:39,038
Look!

387
00:21:40,038 --> 00:21:41,438
<i>What is that?!</i>

388
00:21:41,471 --> 00:21:44,138
<i>It's a Makai Tree</i>
sapling.

389
00:21:44,171 --> 00:21:48,071
An, why don't we take
care of her on a new
planet?

390
00:21:48,105 --> 00:21:51,271
Yes, with our love
energy, she'll grow.

391
00:21:52,371 --> 00:21:53,971
Thank goodness.

392
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:55,138
Yeah.

393
00:22:11,171 --> 00:22:14,338
I know this. Those two
will be happy together.

394
00:22:14,371 --> 00:22:16,571
Yeah, they will.

395
00:22:17,205 --> 00:22:19,171
And we will, too.

396
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:21,105
You go, girl!

397
00:22:21,179 --> 00:22:21,638
[gasping]

398
00:22:21,671 --> 00:22:25,571
[chatting]

399
00:22:25,605 --> 00:22:27,471
I wanna meet someone
just like Mamoru!

400
00:22:27,505 --> 00:22:29,005
Hands off!
He's mine!

401
00:22:29,038 --> 00:22:30,305
Just kidding!

402
00:22:30,338 --> 00:22:31,538
[giggling]

403
00:24:12,614 --> 00:24:15,714
<i>Wow! A girl just fell</i>
from the sky!

404
00:24:15,748 --> 00:24:18,614
<i>Hmm-I feel a strange</i>
<i>energy from that girl.</i>

405
00:24:18,648 --> 00:24:19,548
<i>Hey, little girl!</i>

406
00:24:19,581 --> 00:24:21,681
<i>Stop flirting with my</i>
Mamoru or else!

407
00:24:21,714 --> 00:24:24,881
<i>Be careful, Usagi. She's</i>
<i>after your Silver Crystal.</i>

408
00:24:24,914 --> 00:24:26,714
<i>Who are you anyway?</i>

409
00:24:26,748 --> 00:24:28,281
<i>Are you an enemy?</i>

410
00:24:28,314 --> 00:24:33,681
Next time on Sailor Moon
R: "Angel or Devil? The
Mysterious Girl from the
Sky."

411
00:24:33,714 --> 00:24:36,576
The moonlight is a
messenger of love.
