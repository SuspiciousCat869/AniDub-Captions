...to tomorrow's big test!

Listen, Usagi!

I knew I could count on you!

the right answers Usagi...

it would only end up hurting
you later in life.

way too big a favor...

18
00:03:08,767 --> 00:03:11,734
So then explain why you're
here too, Mako?

19
00:03:11,967 --> 00:03:14,834
Oh well-I figured if I asked
Ami some questions...

20
00:03:14,867 --> 00:03:17,034
...then acing tomorrow's test
would be a total cinch!

21

Just listen to both of you!
We're going to be third-year
students next year!

You're so right...

...he always cared when I really
needed it...

<i>feels better soon...</i>

109
00:10:05,934 --> 00:10:10,201
Well here's what we know. This
enemy is after the life energy
of humans.

110
00:10:10,467 --> 00:10:13,701
The Dark Kingdom's been
destroyed so it can't be them.

111

But these recent events prove
without a doubt there's another
evil presence on the loose out
there.

00:10:18,434 --> 00:10:21,901
I agree...
And their aura's really
different.

113
00:10:21,934 --> 00:10:24,801
I'm thinking maybe all this has
something to do with that...

...strange meteor people saw
falling out of the sky two weeks
ago.

Whoever hurt my friend-I'll tear
them apart!

116
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:36,301
That sounds good-but please
don't destroy my place...!

117
00:10:36,334 --> 00:10:38,401
So how's Kenji doing?

118
00:10:39,101 --> 00:10:41,801
He's still confined to his
hospital bed...

119
00:10:41,834 --> 00:10:42,834
Ohh...

120
00:10:43,867 --> 00:10:46,067
Where's Usagi? I told her
she had to be here!

121
00:10:46,101 --> 00:10:49,901
There's this test she might be
studying for-Uhh...

122
00:10:50,201 --> 00:10:52,801
She's not doing that...
Uh-Uh

123
00:10:53,201 --> 00:10:55,267
Oh! I'm so late!

124
00:10:55,301 --> 00:10:58,367
I knew I should've written
myself a reminder on my hand!

125
00:10:58,401 --> 00:10:59,901
Uh-oh! It's her...!

126
00:10:59,934 --> 00:11:01,234
And she's at it again!

127
00:11:01,701 --> 00:11:05,067
Mamoru, I know a great disco
that's near here.

128
00:11:05,101 --> 00:11:07,234
Would you like to go there
with me?

129
00:11:07,267 --> 00:11:10,701
Um! That's an odd offer-Disco
died decades ago...

130
00:11:10,934 --> 00:11:14,034
Well then let's go do karaoke!
I'm a pretty good singer!

131

That's enough! You sound like a

Maybe this will help!

139

143
00:11:47,134 --> 00:11:52,401
<i>...which made Serenity</i>
<i>sad...Then Endymion disguised</i>
himself as Tuxedo Mask and he...

144
00:11:52,434 --> 00:11:56,734
<i>...protected Serenity from all</i>
<i>the evil forces! And then the</i>
<i>two of them...</i>

145
00:11:56,767 --> 00:11:58,301
What a ridiculous story.

146
00:11:58,334 --> 00:11:59,834
I wasn't finished!

147
00:12:01,301 --> 00:12:03,934

Don't you agree Mamoru?

149
00:12:05,967 --> 00:12:07,267
Where'd Mamoru go...?

150
00:12:08,367 --> 00:12:11,334
<i>Oh hey there Mamoru!</i>
Wait up!

151
