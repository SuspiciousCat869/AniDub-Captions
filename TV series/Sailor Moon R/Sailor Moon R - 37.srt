1
00:01:58,218 --> 00:02:00,487
No, you stay away!

2
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:05,559
The only person I love
is Mamo. I will never
share a kiss with anyone
else!

3
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:07,594
Especially not
you, Demande!

4
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:10,731
You really think you
can just force yourself
on an innocent girl?

5
00:02:10,764 --> 00:02:12,633
Well here's what
I say to that!

6
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:15,669
In the name of the
Moon, I'll punish you!

7
00:02:24,678 --> 00:02:28,348
Wait, is that supposed
to be Crystal Tokyo.

8
00:02:29,082 --> 00:02:30,651
What is all that?

9
00:02:31,051 --> 00:02:31,985
[gasp]

10
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,054
[gasps]

11
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:44,164
Almost all the city
seems to be covered
in ice.

12
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:46,600
So where are
the people?

13
00:02:49,036 --> 00:02:51,304
Is there even anyone
alive out there?

14
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,608
Mommy!

15
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:55,642
Mommy!

16
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:57,310
Wait! Chibi-Usa!

17
00:02:57,444 --> 00:02:59,646
Where are you
going?! Come back!

18
00:03:00,414 --> 00:03:02,582
Hey! Stop! It's
too dangerous here!

19
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:04,317
We must find
her quickly!

20
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:06,019
Chibi-Usa! Wait up!

21
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:16,730
"The Shocking Future:
Demande's Dark Ambition."

22
00:03:18,765 --> 00:03:23,036
Chibi-Usa!

23
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:28,608
Where could she
have gone?

24
00:03:28,642 --> 00:03:30,043
Wish I knew!

25
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:39,019
Hey! Who's there?

26
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:43,290
Stop! Just hold on!

27
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:46,460
[gasp]

28
00:03:47,027 --> 00:03:48,628
Tuxedo Mask?!

29
00:03:49,663 --> 00:03:52,999
But-! It can't be!
Tuxedo Mask is here
with us!

30
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:07,581
I welcome all of you to
the Crystal Tokyo of the
30th century.

31
00:04:08,315 --> 00:04:10,016
I know that voice!

32
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:18,425
[cheering]

33
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:23,530
Mamo, we're finally
able to marry, at
long last.

34
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:26,767
Usako, I'll never
let you go again...

35
00:04:26,967 --> 00:04:28,168
Mamo...

36
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:32,539
Mamoru Chiba, Usagi
Tsukino. You must stay
away from each other.

37
00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:34,107
[screaming]

38
00:04:34,141 --> 00:04:36,710
The moment that the two
of you are wed, the world
will come to an end and

39
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:40,714
tragedy will befall
Usagi Tsukino, Princess
Serenity.

40
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:46,987
So you're that person
who made that doomsday
prediction.

41
00:04:47,654 --> 00:04:49,289
Who are you?!

42
00:04:50,724 --> 00:04:51,591
[growling]

43
00:04:52,359 --> 00:04:52,993
Ah!

44
00:04:53,994 --> 00:04:54,628
[gasp]

45
00:04:57,063 --> 00:04:58,765
What just happened?!

46
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:02,402
I have no intention
of fighting with you.

47
00:05:03,537 --> 00:05:05,672
I am King Endymion.

48
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:12,312
That's right. I am
actually you in the
future.

49
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:14,347
Wait, you're what?!

50
00:05:15,015 --> 00:05:17,584
Tuxedo Mask is
gonna become you?

51
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:21,388
Hold on a sec! Why
does the Mamo of the
future keep on showing

52
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:24,558
up in our dreams and
telling us we have to
end our relationship?!

53
00:05:24,591 --> 00:05:27,694
I'm sensing something,
Sailor Moon, he's not
really here.

54
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:36,303
You are correct, Sailor
Mercury. My true physical
body is actually somewhere
else.

55
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:38,572
So, you're a
hologram?!

56
00:05:39,306 --> 00:05:41,708
The time has come to
explain everything...

57
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,443
I want you to
follow me.

58
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:47,013
Please wait! Before
that we have to find
Chibi-Usa!

59
00:05:47,047 --> 00:05:51,218
Don't worry. I have
her in a safe place.
Come now...

60
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,721
But, shouldn't we...

61
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:57,757
Let's go! This is
not time to be
indecisive.

62
00:05:57,991 --> 00:05:59,492
She's right! C'mon!

63
00:06:00,727 --> 00:06:01,761
[affirmative grunt]

64
00:06:12,339 --> 00:06:15,442
Dammit! They made it
to Crystal Tokyo!

65
00:06:15,609 --> 00:06:17,477
She looks just
like her...

66
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:22,649
Neo Queen Serenity, the
all-powerful goddess who
rules over Crystal Tokyo.

67
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:26,653
She's the exact woman
I've wanted, from the
moment I laid eyes on
her.

68
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,288
They are identical...

69
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:33,493
She is the same in every
way, as the one who sleeps
in the Crystal Palace...

70
00:06:38,465 --> 00:06:40,133
Look at him...

71
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:44,404
As I suspected, Prince
Demande is keenly
interested in Sailor
Moon!

72
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:45,305
Esmeraude!

73
00:06:47,007 --> 00:06:50,176
Your assignment was to
make sure the Sailor
Guardians never reached
Crystal Tokyo!

74
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:52,312
But now, because of
you, they're here!

75
00:06:52,312 --> 00:06:55,582
Uh... I will go
and crush them all!

76
00:06:55,615 --> 00:06:57,150
That won't be
necessary.

77
00:06:58,518 --> 00:06:59,653
I will go...

78
00:06:59,686 --> 00:07:01,021
But brother!

79
00:07:01,054 --> 00:07:04,691
Saphir. Esmeraude.
I want you to go
find the Rabbit.

80
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:06,660
Uh... Yes, sir.

81
00:07:09,296 --> 00:07:10,463
[growling]

82
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:22,309
I will make her pay
dearly for captivating
my Prince Demande!

83
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:27,480
What is this place?

84
00:07:27,514 --> 00:07:32,385
It is all that remains of
our former base. The enemy's
powers cannot reach us here.

85
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:33,453
Where's Chibi-Usa?!

86
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:36,589
Do not worry. You will
get to see her shortly.

87
00:07:37,157 --> 00:07:41,161
First, all of you need
to listen closely to what
I have to say.

88
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:47,267
[gasps]

89
00:07:48,702 --> 00:07:53,073
It all started centuries
ago, when a great calamity
fell upon this world.

90
00:07:53,106 --> 00:07:56,643
As a result, the Earth
fell into a state of
cold sleep.

91
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:00,580
And it remained that
way for a very long time.

92
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:07,253
Then in the 30th century,
the Earth awakened once
again. Thanks to Neo Queen

93
00:08:07,287 --> 00:08:10,190
Serenity and the power
of her Silver Crystal.

94
00:08:14,194 --> 00:08:20,433
With Neo Queen Serenity
as its monarch, the world
sparkled with life once
again, and the city of

95
00:08:20,467 --> 00:08:23,136
the future, Crystal
Tokyo, prospered.

96
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:25,638
But then, a new
evil appeared...

97
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:30,010
All they wanted was
to conquer this
peaceful world.

98
00:08:30,577 --> 00:08:35,315
After many fierce battles,
we finally succeeded in
suppressing this threat.

99
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:41,054
But, rather than choosing
to be cleansed by the
Silver Crystal and change
their ways, many of these

100
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:45,191
malcontents chose instead
to flee, journeying deep
into space.

101
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:50,463
After that, the citizens
of Crystal Tokyo continued
living in peace until planet

102
00:08:50,497 --> 00:08:53,233
Nemesis interfered with
our happy existence.

103
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:55,001
Planet Nemesis?

104
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:58,004
The tenth planet in
the solar system.

105
00:08:58,438 --> 00:09:00,140
Never heard of it...

106
00:09:01,441 --> 00:09:04,611
You wouldn't have. This
strange planet's orbit's
very unpredictable.

107
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:07,480
It's only recently that
we were able to prove
its existence.

108
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:11,251
How did you find it?

109
00:09:13,253 --> 00:09:18,091
By confirming a massive
outpour of negative energy
from its suspected location.
But we found out too late.

110
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:21,594
So then, is that where
the evil people who fled
from Earth ended up?

111
00:09:21,628 --> 00:09:23,329
That's correct.

112
00:09:24,998 --> 00:09:30,270
Regrettably, unbeknownst
to us, Nemesis' inhabitants
had evolved into beings who

113
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:32,572
possessed unusual
super powers...

114
00:09:36,109 --> 00:09:41,347
They now call themselves
the Black Moon Clan. And
they returned here seeking
revenge!

115
00:09:43,216 --> 00:09:48,021
Without warning, they
launched a full-scale
attack, unleashing their
planet's massive negative

116
00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:52,292
energy on Crystal Tokyo,
which completely neutralized
our forces.

117
00:09:58,131 --> 00:10:01,301
Many Guardians fell
during this vicious
onslaught.

118
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:04,504
Leaving only the
Crystal Palace
intact.

119
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:10,009
And a death-like quiet
came over the planet.

120
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:19,152
Even as we stand here,
the Four Guardian Deities:
Sailor Mars, Mercury,
Jupiter and Venus are

121
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:23,189
projecting their life
energy to continue
protecting the palace
from the enemy.

122
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:25,558
So those Guardians
share our names?

123
00:10:25,592 --> 00:10:27,327
How can that be?

124
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:30,530
Those four Guardians
are your future selves.

125
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:31,364
What?!

126
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:38,138
Because of the Black
Moon Clan's evil power,
many people remain in a
deep sleep and our city

127
00:10:38,171 --> 00:10:40,039
seems doomed to
destruction.

128
00:10:40,173 --> 00:10:44,410
I have also been severely
wounded, and am no longer
able to move.

129
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:50,150
Only one thing can
restore this planet to
greatness. The Legendary
Silver Crystal!

130
00:10:50,183 --> 00:10:55,221
But only Neo Queen Serenity
can activate that crystal
and she is in a deep sleep.

131
00:10:55,255 --> 00:10:59,759
Unless she is awakened,
there is not much hope
left for our world.

132
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:06,199
Did you just say she's
the only one who can...
Use the Silver Crystal?

133
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:09,169
But then...
That means...

134
00:11:10,537 --> 00:11:14,541
Yes. She is you in the
future, Sailor Moon.

135
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:21,314
What?! No way! How is
it possible for me to
be Neo Queen Serenity
of the 30th century?!

136
00:11:24,117 --> 00:11:26,352
[groaning]

137
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:33,326
Sailor Moon R!

138
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:49,275
Sailor Moon R!

139
00:11:52,933 --> 00:11:58,138
Neo Queen Serenity,
Crystal Tokyo's queen
in the 30th century.

140
00:11:58,204 --> 00:12:02,809
This is what I'm going
to be in the future?
That can't be.

141
00:12:08,014 --> 00:12:12,285
Tell me, what is this
crystal we see surrounding
the queen's body?

142
00:12:12,319 --> 00:12:13,486
It can't be!

143
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,155
The Silver Crystal?!

144
00:12:15,188 --> 00:12:17,157
No. It's not.

145
00:12:17,891 --> 00:12:21,161
Just before the enemy's
attack was about to strike
the queen...

146
00:12:21,194 --> 00:12:26,800
The Sailor Guardians used
their powers to envelope the
queen's body in a protective
crystal shell.

147
00:12:27,767 --> 00:12:31,738
Ever since that day,
the queen has been
secluded in a deep
sleep.

148
00:12:32,806 --> 00:12:34,007
And so...

149
00:12:35,308 --> 00:12:39,746
For our only daughter,
Small Lady, this would
mean losing her mother.

150
00:12:46,486 --> 00:12:49,956
[gasps]

151
00:12:52,025 --> 00:12:53,693
Chibi-Usa!

152
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:59,399
So this is where
you were...

153
00:12:59,766 --> 00:13:02,769
Sailor Moon...
Tuxedo Mask...

154
00:13:02,802 --> 00:13:05,438
That girl you're
holding is your
daughter.

155
00:13:05,739 --> 00:13:09,476
Wha-?! Chibi-Usa is
really my daughter?!

156
00:13:09,709 --> 00:13:10,410
[gasp]

157
00:13:10,443 --> 00:13:14,047
So that means...
You and I...

158
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:18,818
So Chibi-Usa is...

159
00:13:18,852 --> 00:13:20,453
...Sailor Moon's
child?

160
00:13:20,854 --> 00:13:23,390
Then Tuxedo Mask
is her father?

161
00:13:24,157 --> 00:13:27,694
So then what year, month,
and day did that happen
exactly?!

162
00:13:27,994 --> 00:13:29,095
Uh...

163
00:13:30,864 --> 00:13:35,402
I hope that you'll
forgive her for those
times she was so rude.
She was just desperate.

164
00:13:37,037 --> 00:13:38,938
I've always shared
with her...

165
00:13:38,972 --> 00:13:41,775
...many stories about
Sailor Moon...

166
00:13:44,844 --> 00:13:48,782
The legendary,
invincible Guardian,
Sailor Moon...

167
00:13:50,183 --> 00:13:55,355
That was probably where
she got the idea to go
back into the past to
seek out your help.

168
00:13:56,790 --> 00:14:01,895
The Black Moon Clan's
objective was to defeat
us here, and then steal
the Legendary Silver

169
00:14:01,895 --> 00:14:04,898
Crystal so they could
take over the entire
world.

170
00:14:05,832 --> 00:14:09,402
Once they knew they
could not bring down
our Crystal Palace...

171
00:14:09,436 --> 00:14:12,906
They tried to destroy
the world of the past,
your world.

172
00:14:12,939 --> 00:14:15,041
If the world of the
past is destroyed...

173
00:14:15,075 --> 00:14:17,010
This world would be
destroyed, as well!

174
00:14:17,043 --> 00:14:21,347
Exactly. Which is why
you must protect your
world at all costs!

175
00:14:21,381 --> 00:14:21,848
Right!

176
00:14:21,881 --> 00:14:22,816
We will!

177
00:14:24,017 --> 00:14:28,755
Sailor Moon, Tuxedo
Mask, I know that I
exposed you both to

178
00:14:28,788 --> 00:14:30,990
nightmares and
ominous images.

179
00:14:31,057 --> 00:14:32,459
So you may be angry...

180
00:14:34,094 --> 00:14:36,996
But to win this battle,
to stand strong against
this enemy, you can't

181
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:39,766
have a frivolous, half-
hearted love between
you...

182
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:43,703
Unless the two of you
share an unbreakable bond
of love, you will not be

183
00:14:43,736 --> 00:14:46,439
able to overcome the
danger you will face.

184
00:14:46,439 --> 00:14:48,942
That is why I
tested your love.

185
00:14:49,909 --> 00:14:51,845
A strong bond
of love...

186
00:14:51,878 --> 00:14:58,118
Yes. An unwavering,
faithful love. A love
that remains strong and
constant, no matter what

187
00:14:58,151 --> 00:14:59,786
the enemy throws
at you.

188
00:15:02,722 --> 00:15:09,362
Sailor Moon, Tuxedo
Mask, please, I want
you both to keep Small
Lady safe.

189
00:15:10,363 --> 00:15:14,467
In my current condition,
I am unable to stay with
her, or protect her.

190
00:15:15,802 --> 00:15:19,038
I swear! I will
protect this child
with my life!

191
00:15:22,842 --> 00:15:26,946
It's strange. Here I
am speaking to myself
in the past.

192
00:15:27,747 --> 00:15:29,349
Look after her...

193
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:31,918
[gasps]

194
00:15:32,318 --> 00:15:33,953
[grunting]

195
00:15:33,987 --> 00:15:35,455
What's happening?!

196
00:15:36,756 --> 00:15:39,292
So this is where
you've been hiding!

197
00:15:39,692 --> 00:15:41,694
Well it won't do
you any good.

198
00:15:41,961 --> 00:15:43,997
[chuckling]

199
00:15:44,063 --> 00:15:45,331
Who are you?

200
00:15:46,966 --> 00:15:50,703
Those eyes of hers.
They're the same ones
that looked at me way
back then...

201
00:15:51,437 --> 00:15:53,306
Those beautiful eyes...

202
00:15:55,074 --> 00:15:56,009
[growl]

203
00:15:57,477 --> 00:15:58,444
Ah!

204
00:15:58,912 --> 00:16:02,048
You will come with
me young lady!

205
00:16:02,982 --> 00:16:03,850
[gasp]

206
00:16:06,052 --> 00:16:08,421
[groaning]

207
00:16:08,454 --> 00:16:09,889
Burning-

208
00:16:09,889 --> 00:16:11,291
Shine Aqua-

209
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:14,994
It's no use! He's
draining all of
our power!

210
00:16:15,361 --> 00:16:17,297
[laughing]

211
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:18,198
Come!

212
00:16:18,798 --> 00:16:20,366
Uh... Ah...

213
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,434
Usako!

214
00:16:22,902 --> 00:16:23,836
Hnnh!

215
00:16:25,271 --> 00:16:25,939
No!

216
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:30,777
[screaming]

217
00:16:32,045 --> 00:16:33,046
Aah!

218
00:16:33,046 --> 00:16:35,448
I was hoping to
capture both of
you at once.

219
00:16:35,448 --> 00:16:38,451
But at least I have
my real prize in hand.

220
00:16:38,751 --> 00:16:39,352
[gasp]

221
00:16:41,754 --> 00:16:46,159
Oh no! I can't take my
eyes off him! I can't
move my body!

222
00:16:48,328 --> 00:16:49,762
Sailor Moon!

223
00:16:49,796 --> 00:16:50,363
Usako!

224
00:16:50,396 --> 00:16:52,932
Please take care
of Small Lady!

225
00:16:54,234 --> 00:16:55,902
Don't panic,
Tuxedo Mask!

226
00:16:56,703 --> 00:16:59,305
I have a good idea
of where he's headed.

227
00:17:07,981 --> 00:17:11,251
My head hurts.
What happened
to me?

228
00:17:11,718 --> 00:17:12,418
[gasp]

229
00:17:12,452 --> 00:17:14,254
Why am I dressed
like this?

230
00:17:14,787 --> 00:17:15,888
My brooch!

231
00:17:19,892 --> 00:17:22,295
I feel like I have
no strength at all...

232
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:25,164
Where am I?

233
00:17:25,465 --> 00:17:27,200
[gasp]

234
00:17:27,233 --> 00:17:31,137
You are all that I
thought you'd be. You
took the full force of
the power of the Malefic

235
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:34,774
Black Crystal in my
attack, yet you're
already awake.

236
00:17:34,774 --> 00:17:39,178
But, you may find this
castle a bit unpleasant.

237
00:17:39,212 --> 00:17:41,180
Just who are you?

238
00:17:41,281 --> 00:17:43,316
I am Prince Demande.

239
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:48,454
I welcome you to our
forward operating
base, Sailor Moon.
Or...

240
00:17:48,454 --> 00:17:53,359
It might be more appropriate
for me to call you the future
Neo Queen Serenity.

241
00:17:53,393 --> 00:17:57,130
Now, let's have a
nice relaxing talk.

242
00:17:57,196 --> 00:17:58,298
Aah!

243
00:18:01,768 --> 00:18:06,372
Moon Crystal Power
Make Up!

244
00:18:07,173 --> 00:18:08,875
I can't transform!

245
00:18:09,742 --> 00:18:13,813
Your Legendary Silver
Crystal's power is
rendered useless against

246
00:18:13,846 --> 00:18:15,848
the Malefic Black
Crystal.

247
00:18:17,317 --> 00:18:19,085
Malefic Black Crystal?!

248
00:18:19,786 --> 00:18:25,124
This entire chamber is
filled with the power-
absorbing strength of the
Malefic Black Crystal.

249
00:18:25,158 --> 00:18:28,461
Even your Silver
Crystal's power
will be absorbed.

250
00:18:29,262 --> 00:18:30,730
Aah! No!

251
00:18:33,299 --> 00:18:37,203
Those eyes. The eyes
of Neo Queen Serenity.

252
00:18:38,204 --> 00:18:39,305
Aah!

253
00:18:41,174 --> 00:18:44,811
I made this room
just for you, Sailor
Moon.

254
00:18:45,178 --> 00:18:48,881
It will be your
resting place for
all eternity.

255
00:18:50,183 --> 00:18:55,855
Ah! Tell me why!
Why have you chosen to
single our Earth and
try to ruin it!

256
00:18:55,888 --> 00:19:00,860
Since I have the Malefic
Black Crystal, I can
control all space,
energy and time...

257
00:19:00,893 --> 00:19:04,297
And I plan to rule
you and Earth forever!

258
00:19:04,764 --> 00:19:05,431
[gasp]

259
00:19:08,267 --> 00:19:09,435
Usako!

260
00:19:14,207 --> 00:19:20,079
Whoever possesses true
absolute power will lay
claim to this planet.
And rightfully so.

261
00:19:20,313 --> 00:19:23,082
Your thinking is
twisted and wrong!

262
00:19:23,383 --> 00:19:25,084
[chuckling]

263
00:19:25,118 --> 00:19:26,452
[grunting]

264
00:19:26,452 --> 00:19:29,989
Yes, my Queen. I
would do anything
to have you.

265
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:33,459
[gasp]

266
00:19:34,394 --> 00:19:38,431
Neo Queen Serenity,
at last you are mine!

267
00:19:39,432 --> 00:19:41,033
Usako!

268
00:19:41,067 --> 00:19:45,037
Mamo?! Was that
my imagination?

269
00:19:45,338 --> 00:19:47,473
You sounded
so far way!

270
00:19:48,141 --> 00:19:52,445
I'm so afraid! I'm
all alone and I
can't transform!

271
00:19:55,214 --> 00:19:56,215
[gasp]

272
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:58,317
Help me!

273
00:20:01,287 --> 00:20:03,189
Someone other
than you...

274
00:20:03,356 --> 00:20:05,792
...is about
to kiss me!

275
00:20:07,226 --> 00:20:08,094
Agh!

276
00:20:09,762 --> 00:20:11,998
[screaming]

277
00:20:12,064 --> 00:20:13,166
Who did that?!

278
00:20:15,101 --> 00:20:16,369
Tuxedo Mask!

279
00:20:17,904 --> 00:20:20,773
How dare you use your evil
depravity and demented
power to try and force

280
00:20:20,773 --> 00:20:22,241
yourself on an
innocent woman!

281
00:20:22,275 --> 00:20:23,443
You coward!

282
00:20:23,709 --> 00:20:26,145
Silence! You self-
righteous prick!

283
00:20:28,781 --> 00:20:30,349
[chuckling]

284
00:20:30,383 --> 00:20:31,751
Agh!

285
00:20:32,285 --> 00:20:33,252
Wha-?!

286
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,155
Usako! Quickly!

287
00:20:38,357 --> 00:20:41,027
[grunting]

288
00:20:43,262 --> 00:20:44,997
[groaning]

289
00:20:45,064 --> 00:20:46,232
Come back here!

290
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:48,734
[groaning]

291
00:20:58,277 --> 00:20:59,045
Hmph!

292
00:21:01,414 --> 00:21:02,482
Esmeraude!

293
00:21:02,715 --> 00:21:03,249
Hm?

294
00:21:05,084 --> 00:21:09,155
I hope you are not the
reason those two were
able to undermine my
brother's plans and escape!

295
00:21:09,789 --> 00:21:15,228
Me helping those two
escape? And what makes
you think I would do
such a thing?

296
00:21:15,261 --> 00:21:18,731
Women are capable of
anything and when their
is jealousy involved,

297
00:21:18,764 --> 00:21:20,433
there's no telling
what they'll do.

298
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,836
Maybe in that strange
mind of yours, you
actually feel good

299
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:26,005
about Sailor Moon
getting away from
my brother.

300
00:21:26,038 --> 00:21:28,441
[ridiculous laugh]

301
00:21:29,175 --> 00:21:35,281
I have pledged my undying
loyalty to Prince Demande!
And I'm not switching
sides, Saphir.

302
00:21:35,481 --> 00:21:37,383
[chuckling]

303
00:21:37,817 --> 00:21:43,422
Hm. I know you. And I
know exactly how you
feel about Sailor Moon.

304
00:21:43,422 --> 00:21:44,757
Huh?

305
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:49,028
Listen Esmeraude, I
despise Sailor Moon
as much as you do!

306
00:21:49,061 --> 00:21:50,029
[chuckling]

307
00:21:50,062 --> 00:21:53,165
Well then, we're birds
of a feather, aren't we?

308
00:22:02,308 --> 00:22:04,310
Oh, Tuxedo Mask.

309
00:22:05,378 --> 00:22:11,951
Remember what King
Endymion told us. We
must conquer this
battle with our love.

310
00:22:12,752 --> 00:22:15,454
No matter what
happens, we are
one...

311
00:24:10,723 --> 00:24:13,025
Why isn't the Silver
Crystal here in the
future?

312
00:24:13,025 --> 00:24:14,193
Who could've taken it?

313
00:24:14,427 --> 00:24:16,729
Uh... No, I...

314
00:24:16,763 --> 00:24:18,631
What's the matter,
Chibi-Usa?

315
00:24:18,631 --> 00:24:22,135
No, that's not true!
I didn't mean to do it!

316
00:24:22,168 --> 00:24:26,739
All I did was touch
the Silver Crystal.
Really! It's not
my fault!

317
00:24:26,773 --> 00:24:27,907
Chibi-Usa, wait!

318
00:24:29,642 --> 00:24:34,080
Next time on Sailor Moon R:
"Wiseman's Evil Hand:
Chibi-Usa Disappears"

319
00:24:34,113 --> 00:24:37,049
The moonlight is a
messenger of love.
