1
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:03,557
Look Natsumi, I know life can be
tough sometimes, but that's no
reason to stop coming to class.

2
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:07,657
You're my friend, so if there's
anyway I can help you, just let
me know!

3
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:10,123
Huh? There's a Makai
Tree in your house?

4
00:02:10,157 --> 00:02:12,623
Well if that's
the case...

5
00:02:12,657 --> 00:02:16,557
I am Sailor Moon.
And in the name of
the Moon...
I'll punish you.

6
00:02:23,557 --> 00:02:31,323
"Disconnecting Love:
The Raging Makai Tree."

7
00:02:31,357 --> 00:02:37,323
[sigh] Here I am looking
perfect on my day off and
yet the boys don't seem
to notice.

8
00:02:37,357 --> 00:02:39,623
Seriously, what is
wrong with them?!

9
00:02:41,657 --> 00:02:45,057
Today for sure,
I'm going to steal
Usagi's heart!

10
00:02:53,990 --> 00:03:01,357
Today's the day.
I'm determined to find
a way to steal Mamoru's
heart.

11
00:03:02,257 --> 00:03:05,090
What a surprise
to see you,
Mamoru!

12
00:03:05,123 --> 00:03:06,690
Hey there,
Natsumi.

13
00:03:06,723 --> 00:03:10,223
Isn't it a wonderful
coincidence, running
into you here?
[giggle]

14
00:03:10,257 --> 00:03:12,657
[startled]
Yeah. Sure is.

15
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:19,990
What a surprise, Usagi.
I never expected to bump
into you here.

16
00:03:20,023 --> 00:03:21,590
Me, neither.

17
00:03:21,623 --> 00:03:26,057
Just being able to spot you
here among all these people
is almost a true miracle.

18
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:27,423
It sure is.

19
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:29,323
(Mamoru)
C'mon, now.
Let go already!

20
00:03:29,357 --> 00:03:30,423
Huh?

21
00:03:30,457 --> 00:03:32,457
[giggles]
You're so cute when
you get upset with me!

22
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:33,523
Mamoru...

23
00:03:33,557 --> 00:03:35,257
And Natsumi!

24
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:37,557
Why look who's here.
If it isn't little
Bun-Head.

25
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:41,390
Hello, Brother.
Here on a date
with Tsukino?

26
00:03:41,423 --> 00:03:44,057
You told me you
were going off
to the library!

27
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:47,457
And you said you were
going to a friend's
place to study!

28
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:49,057
[groan]

29
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:53,357
(Ail)
Natsumi, Wait!

30
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:55,123
What is it about him
that's so special?

31
00:03:55,157 --> 00:03:56,390
What about
her, Ail?

32
00:03:56,423 --> 00:03:58,090
[gasp]

33
00:04:07,557 --> 00:04:09,990
Why is this
happening
so suddenly?

34
00:04:10,023 --> 00:04:12,057
It really
is bizarre.

35
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:15,123
It must be reacting
to you chasing after
Tsukino.

36
00:04:15,157 --> 00:04:18,223
Oh, look who's talking
you've done quite a bit
of chasing, too!

37
00:04:18,257 --> 00:04:20,957
You know what happens
if it wilts and dies.

38
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:24,623
We won't have an energy source.
How will we be able to go on?

39
00:04:24,657 --> 00:04:27,590
I'm well aware.
But we have no
choice, we must
feed it.

40
00:04:27,623 --> 00:04:32,290
Even if it now
needs a larger
amount of energy.

41
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:40,357
How exciting! They're
doing a Sailor Moon Show!
[giggles]
I'm a superstar!

42
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:43,957
Hope they were able
to find a good lazy
goof ball to play
the part.

43
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:46,357
Luna!

44
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:52,157
I am the Pretty Guardian who
fights for love and for justice.
I am Sailor Moon!

45
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:54,557
And in the name
of the moon...

46
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:56,523
I will punish you!

47
00:04:56,557 --> 00:04:59,423
Sailor Moon has
sure become famous,
hasn't she?

48
00:04:59,457 --> 00:05:03,590
She sure has. I never
imagined she'd become
this popular.

49
00:05:03,623 --> 00:05:05,390
We should feel proud
to have met her.

50
00:05:05,423 --> 00:05:07,290
I know!

51
00:05:07,323 --> 00:05:08,357
[startled]

52
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:11,157
Yamandakka!

53
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:13,457
Whatever it is,
it's sure weird
looking.

54
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:18,457
Ya..Man..
Dak..Ka!

55
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:23,257
W-What is that?

56
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:26,457
Yamandakka!

57
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:29,257
[confused screams]

58
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:30,490
[fearful screams]

59
00:05:30,523 --> 00:05:32,357
[pained moan]

60
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:41,123
Yamandakka, Yamandakka,
Yamandakka, Yamandakka.

61
00:05:44,123 --> 00:05:50,090
[gasp]
What is this?
What happened?

62
00:05:50,123 --> 00:05:52,357
All of them have had
their energy stolen!

63
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:55,223
And this time every bit
of it's been drained from
their bodies!

64
00:05:55,257 --> 00:05:56,357
That's never
happened before.

65
00:05:56,390 --> 00:06:01,157
[gasp]
Not these two
again!

66
00:06:01,623 --> 00:06:06,923
Yamandakka, Yamandakka,
Yamandakka.

67
00:06:06,957 --> 00:06:09,257
That's strange.
There's no reaction.

68
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:12,923
Something's definitely
different this time.
That can only mean.

69
00:06:12,957 --> 00:06:14,357
What?

70
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:17,623
It means the Makai Tree
is unable to adapt to
this planet's environment.

71
00:06:17,657 --> 00:06:18,723
That can't be!

72
00:06:18,757 --> 00:06:21,957
What if it is?
What are we going
to do about it?

73
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:24,623
Yaman..
..dakka.

74
00:06:25,157 --> 00:06:28,623
(Haruna)
So it looks like Umino
and Miss Osaka are out
sick.

75
00:06:28,657 --> 00:06:30,490
And Miss Ginga
is also absent.

76
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:33,990
Most likely her brother,
Seijuro Ginga, won't be
here, either!

77
00:06:34,023 --> 00:06:36,190
And how did you know
that, Miss Tsukino?

78
00:06:36,223 --> 00:06:40,623
[chuckles]
I can't reveal my sources
but it's a pretty safe bet!

79
00:06:40,657 --> 00:06:44,390
I don't understand why
we have to go along with
you to check up on them.

80
00:06:44,423 --> 00:06:47,490
C'mon. I asked you
because I wanted to
walk with my friends.

81
00:06:47,523 --> 00:06:50,323
Do you know if Umino
and Naru are going to
be okay?

82
00:06:50,357 --> 00:06:54,990
Yeah, but they're completely
drained of energy, so I figure
they're gonna need a lot of
time to recuperate.

83
00:06:55,023 --> 00:06:58,657
It looks like the enemy
has started attacking
in a different way now.

84
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:01,023
Oh I guess so.

85
00:07:06,057 --> 00:07:07,219
Is anybody home?

86
00:07:08,531 --> 00:07:08,990
Mm?

87
00:07:09,023 --> 00:07:09,723
[small gasp]

88
00:07:09,757 --> 00:07:12,557
Usagi! What a
pleasant surprise!

89
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:13,923
[fake cough]

90
00:07:13,957 --> 00:07:17,190
You have matching outfits?!
Sort of weird for a brother
and sister.

91
00:07:17,223 --> 00:07:20,557
Yeah, that's more of a
boyfriend, girlfriend
kind of thing to do.

92
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:24,590
You think so? Well, we lost
both of our parents when we
were very young children,

93
00:07:24,623 --> 00:07:29,490
so I guess you could say we're
probably a whole lot closer
than most of the siblings
you've come across before now.

94
00:07:29,523 --> 00:07:31,390
That makes sense.

95
00:07:31,423 --> 00:07:32,690
Why are you
here, anyway?

96
00:07:32,723 --> 00:07:36,190
It's rude to just drop
by without letting us
know you're coming.

97
00:07:36,223 --> 00:07:37,523
Lighten up on the
attitude missy.

98
00:07:37,557 --> 00:07:40,423
Usagi wanted to come by
because she was worried
about both of you.

99
00:07:40,457 --> 00:07:41,457
Hey, Mako!

100
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:43,357
It's just annoying!

101
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:45,690
Usagi's only trying
to do a good deed.

102
00:07:45,723 --> 00:07:47,423
Mm-hm.

103
00:07:47,457 --> 00:07:50,423
Since you've come all
this way, why don't you
come in and have some
tea with us?

104
00:07:50,457 --> 00:07:51,490
Hold on, Brother.

105
00:07:51,523 --> 00:07:53,257
Please,
I insist.

106
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:54,957
Hmph!

107
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:59,223
[humming]

108
00:07:59,257 --> 00:08:02,257
What is this
sensation that
I'm feeling?

109
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:04,590
Natsumi, why did
you stay home
from school?

110
00:08:04,623 --> 00:08:07,190
My personal life is
really none of your
business.

111
00:08:07,223 --> 00:08:10,223
I get that but we're
asking because we
were worried about you.

112
00:08:10,257 --> 00:08:13,390
Worried about me?
Why would you be?

113
00:08:13,423 --> 00:08:16,390
Why was I worried?
Well because I started
thinking,

114
00:08:16,423 --> 00:08:20,023
maybe she's had an accident,
or hurt herself? Or maybe she's
sick?

115
00:08:20,057 --> 00:08:22,123
Those are the kind of
things I worry about.

116
00:08:22,157 --> 00:08:23,723
That's what
friends do.

117
00:08:23,757 --> 00:08:27,257
And we're also worried,
if you miss school, you'll
fall way behind in your studies.

118
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:28,690
Oh yeah,
so what
if I do?

119
00:08:28,723 --> 00:08:33,190
What happens to me is not
really any of your concern.
It's my business.

120
00:08:33,223 --> 00:08:35,457
I've had enough of this!
Let's get out of here!

121
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:37,623
(Sailor Moon)
Hey, what's behind
this door- your study?

122
00:08:37,657 --> 00:08:39,557
Cool!
It's automatic!

123
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:40,023
[gasp]

124
00:08:40,057 --> 00:08:41,157
Don't touch that!

125
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:42,457
[startled]

126
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:45,590
You can't go in there.
I don't want you to see
how messy we are.

127
00:08:45,623 --> 00:08:47,523
Then you should
ask Mako to help
you clean it.

128
00:08:47,557 --> 00:08:50,090
She's an absolute
whiz at cleaning
up messes!

129
00:08:50,123 --> 00:08:51,457
Isn't that
right, Mako?

130
00:08:54,123 --> 00:08:59,190
[scoffs]
I can't take anymore of you
trying to butt into our lives,
so would you please leave!

131
00:08:59,223 --> 00:09:02,423
[sigh]

132
00:09:02,457 --> 00:09:03,590
Now.
Out you go.

133
00:09:03,623 --> 00:09:07,357
Usagi, it's pretty clear
we're not wanted here...
Come on.

134
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:09,057
Okay, see you later.

135
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,923
Ah.. What about
your tea, Usagi?

136
00:09:10,957 --> 00:09:13,657
Uh, maybe next time.
[small giggle]

137
00:09:18,457 --> 00:09:22,423
How kind of you to keep
an eye out to make sure
they get home safely.

138
00:09:22,457 --> 00:09:28,690
An..Do you feel what I can
only describe as a warm,
glowing sensation inside,
around your heart?

139
00:09:28,723 --> 00:09:30,290
What are you
talking about?

140
00:09:30,323 --> 00:09:32,490
I'm not
really sure.

141
00:09:32,523 --> 00:09:35,657
I've never experienced
this before now.

142
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:43,690
Time to
wake up,
Usagi!

143
00:09:43,723 --> 00:09:45,257
C'mon,
get up!

144
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:47,257
Well that's
strange...

145
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:50,023
Where'd
she go?

146
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:53,023
C'mon!
Let's go!

147
00:09:53,057 --> 00:09:55,490
What are you doing
at my house this
early?!

148
00:09:55,523 --> 00:09:59,657
Look I'm totally against
getting up early and I'd
love to skip school...

149
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:01,290
But we can't,
we have to go!

150
00:10:01,323 --> 00:10:04,457
Oh! I didn't expect
you to be back here
so soon to see me!

151
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:07,323
Oh, uh actually,
I came over here
to get Natsumi.

152
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:09,590
Brother, tell her
that she needs to
leave right now!

153
00:10:09,623 --> 00:10:14,390
Well, she did come all this way,
so why don't we invite her in
for some cake and meat buns?

154
00:10:14,423 --> 00:10:17,523
Thanks!
I love those!
[giggles]

155
00:10:17,557 --> 00:10:20,323
Yeah, thanks a lot.

156
00:10:20,357 --> 00:10:22,490
(An)
Why did you
do that?

157
00:10:22,523 --> 00:10:24,990
I'm not really
sure why I did
it.

158
00:10:25,023 --> 00:10:27,290
It just seemed
right at the time.

159
00:10:27,323 --> 00:10:29,490
You've been acting
strange lately.

160
00:10:29,523 --> 00:10:32,957
Yesterday, he said not
to go inside, but now
I'm even more curious.

161
00:10:35,523 --> 00:10:38,190
Sometimes I'm
just a bad girl.

162
00:10:41,357 --> 00:10:43,323
It's pitch black.

163
00:10:43,357 --> 00:10:46,323
So bright!

164
00:10:46,357 --> 00:10:47,490
[struggling]

165
00:10:50,223 --> 00:10:52,257
[fearful scream]

166
00:10:53,223 --> 00:10:55,457
[struggling]

167
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:56,890
[small yell]

168
00:10:58,557 --> 00:11:00,457
Usagi, are
you all right?

169
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:02,090
You weren't hurt
or anything, were
you?

170
00:11:02,123 --> 00:11:04,990
W-What's with that room?!

171
00:11:05,023 --> 00:11:09,257
Ah, nothing really.
I was conducting an
experiment.

172
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:11,523
What kind of
experiment?

173
00:11:11,557 --> 00:11:15,190
Well, all I can tell you is
astro-botany is involved.

174
00:11:15,223 --> 00:11:17,323
Wow...
Space plants.

175
00:11:17,357 --> 00:11:18,390
(An)
What were you
thinking?!

176
00:11:18,423 --> 00:11:19,523
Huh?

177
00:11:19,557 --> 00:11:22,123
You had no right to
go into our room!
You're so rude!

178
00:11:22,157 --> 00:11:24,523
I'm sorry.

179
00:11:24,557 --> 00:11:28,057
Anyway, I'm not going
to school. You can go
on without me.

180
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:30,657
Oh. All right.

181
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:37,957
[happy giggles]

182
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:39,390
[small chuckle]

183
00:11:39,423 --> 00:11:43,657
Be sure you both
come to school
tomorrow, okay?

184
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:45,490
[startled gasp]

185
00:11:45,523 --> 00:11:47,290
There it is again..

186
00:11:47,323 --> 00:11:50,190
This warm sensation
around my heart..

187
00:11:50,223 --> 00:11:53,557
What could it be?

188
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:59,423
Sailor Moon...

189
00:11:59,457 --> 00:12:00,799
R!

190
00:12:12,748 --> 00:12:17,682
Sailor Moon! R!

191
00:12:22,048 --> 00:12:24,048
What do you make
of this, Ail?

192
00:12:24,082 --> 00:12:28,715
Maybe the energy
is finally having
an effect.

193
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:33,148
But it hadn't been
growing at all until
now.

194
00:12:33,182 --> 00:12:34,582
What do you
mean, An?

195
00:12:34,615 --> 00:12:37,048
Until it
grabbed
Tsukino.

196
00:12:37,082 --> 00:12:38,615
[struggling yell]

197
00:12:38,648 --> 00:12:41,582
Taking Tsukino's
energy caused it
to grow!

198
00:12:41,615 --> 00:12:43,682
It can't be!

199
00:12:43,715 --> 00:12:50,015
If we squeeze every drop of
energy from her, that actually
might be enough to rejuvenate
the entire Makai Tree.

200
00:12:50,048 --> 00:12:50,715
Wait!

201
00:12:50,748 --> 00:12:52,148
You're against it?

202
00:12:52,182 --> 00:12:54,348
No, of course not,
not at all if it works.

203
00:12:54,382 --> 00:12:57,315
But there's something
I'd like to try, first.

204
00:12:57,348 --> 00:12:58,315
Huh?

205
00:12:58,348 --> 00:13:00,448
Yamandakka!

206
00:13:00,482 --> 00:13:02,948
Dakka.

207
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:05,615
Give all your energy
to that sapling!

208
00:13:05,648 --> 00:13:07,682
Yamandakka!

209
00:13:07,715 --> 00:13:09,548
Why are you telling
it to do that?

210
00:13:09,582 --> 00:13:16,148
If we can get this sapling
to grow, then we'll have a
brand new Makai Tree with
lush green leaves.

211
00:13:16,182 --> 00:13:18,682
I don't think this
is the best idea...

212
00:13:22,115 --> 00:13:23,215
[gasp]

213
00:13:23,248 --> 00:13:25,948
Yamandakka.

214
00:13:25,982 --> 00:13:29,682
There goes our
one good sapling.

215
00:13:29,715 --> 00:13:32,148
[Pain wailing]

216
00:13:32,182 --> 00:13:33,015
[gasps]

217
00:13:33,048 --> 00:13:35,582
Did the Makai Tree
just make that sound?

218
00:13:40,715 --> 00:13:44,115
You must have been
hearing things.

219
00:13:44,148 --> 00:13:47,648
Ail, what exactly
is the Makai Tree?

220
00:13:47,682 --> 00:13:49,015
You should
know that!

221
00:13:49,048 --> 00:13:51,282
The tree is our
precious life source.

222
00:13:51,315 --> 00:13:53,415
Something passed
down from our
ancestors.

223
00:13:53,448 --> 00:13:55,615
Yes, but is
that all?

224
00:13:55,648 --> 00:14:02,415
It also has the ability to
extract and filter the prime
energy best suited for our
bodies.

225
00:14:02,448 --> 00:14:03,515
So that's it?

226
00:14:03,548 --> 00:14:07,448
Yes, I believe
that's everything.

227
00:14:09,448 --> 00:14:12,482
Wow! You went back
there again alone?

228
00:14:12,515 --> 00:14:14,715
That took a lot
of courage, Usagi.

229
00:14:14,748 --> 00:14:16,648
[giggles]

230
00:14:16,682 --> 00:14:18,215
[gasp]
Usagi, there's
something on
your head!

231
00:14:18,248 --> 00:14:19,182
Huh?

232
00:14:19,215 --> 00:14:20,715
[pained yelp]

233
00:14:20,748 --> 00:14:22,682
Hmm...

234
00:14:22,715 --> 00:14:23,915
Huh?

235
00:14:25,348 --> 00:14:26,448
[scream]

236
00:14:26,482 --> 00:14:31,248
What is
that thing?

237
00:14:31,282 --> 00:14:35,048
It's really creepy.

238
00:14:37,148 --> 00:14:39,215
Luna, did you find
out anything?

239
00:14:39,248 --> 00:14:41,582
Yes, this plant has
a terrible secret.

240
00:14:41,615 --> 00:14:43,448
It's quite dangerous.
Show them, Artemis.

241
00:14:43,482 --> 00:14:45,682
Huh?
I don't
want to!

242
00:14:45,715 --> 00:14:47,082
Artemis!

243
00:14:47,115 --> 00:14:50,215
All right I'll do it.

244
00:14:50,248 --> 00:14:53,382
[small whimper]

245
00:14:54,682 --> 00:14:55,682
[scream]

246
00:14:55,715 --> 00:14:56,448
[scared yells]

247
00:14:56,482 --> 00:14:59,248
[pained yell]

248
00:15:03,548 --> 00:15:04,715
Do you understand?

249
00:15:04,748 --> 00:15:06,215
Not at all!

250
00:15:06,248 --> 00:15:07,115
[groan]

251
00:15:07,148 --> 00:15:09,048
Looks like it
steals energy,
doesn't it?

252
00:15:09,082 --> 00:15:10,415
Exactly!

253
00:15:10,448 --> 00:15:14,015
How did you ever manage to get
that thing stuck on you anyway,
Usagi?

254
00:15:14,048 --> 00:15:15,048
Uh...

255
00:15:15,082 --> 00:15:18,115
What Luna and I discovered
is almost unbelievable.

256
00:15:18,148 --> 00:15:20,648
Huh?

257
00:15:20,682 --> 00:15:22,415
Wait for it?

258
00:15:22,448 --> 00:15:25,215
Stop with the suspense
and just tell us.

259
00:15:25,248 --> 00:15:29,482
This is a small branch
from the Makai Tree.

260
00:15:29,515 --> 00:15:31,548
Makai Tree?!

261
00:15:31,582 --> 00:15:35,082
Oh...
I get it.

262
00:15:35,115 --> 00:15:36,115
So what's a
Makai Tree?

263
00:15:36,148 --> 00:15:37,715
[groan]

264
00:15:37,748 --> 00:15:41,415
A mysterious energy-sucking
tree that grows in outer
space.

265
00:15:41,448 --> 00:15:46,448
That's all we really know.
And it's anyone's guess as
to what its true purpose is.

266
00:15:46,482 --> 00:15:50,415
But why was such a dangerous
branch in Natsumi's apartment
in the first place?

267
00:15:50,448 --> 00:15:55,082
Seijuro said he was doing
some kind of special
experimental botany project.

268
00:15:55,115 --> 00:15:56,115
Which means...

269
00:15:56,148 --> 00:15:57,948
Which means
what Usagi?

270
00:15:57,982 --> 00:16:00,048
This thing must be
some kind of plant.

271
00:16:00,082 --> 00:16:02,982
You still don't get it?
How can you be so dense?

272
00:16:03,015 --> 00:16:08,215
It means that this branch
came from a Makai Tree that
might be in their apartment.

273
00:16:08,248 --> 00:16:11,982
A normal person wouldn't
keep a tree like that
in their collection.

274
00:16:12,015 --> 00:16:12,948
What're you
trying to say?

275
00:16:12,982 --> 00:16:15,582
We're saying,
that those two
are suspicious.

276
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:17,348
Huh?

277
00:16:17,382 --> 00:16:21,015
If this is true, then they may
be the ones behind the series
of recent unexplained incidents.

278
00:16:21,048 --> 00:16:26,115
In other words, Seijuro
and Natsumi are actually...
Ail and An!

279
00:16:26,148 --> 00:16:29,215
C'mon.
No way!

280
00:16:34,448 --> 00:16:37,382
Usagi, it's too
risky to go there
by yourself.

281
00:16:37,415 --> 00:16:44,982
But, thing is I gotta tell
you, I'm still having a hard
time believing that Seijuro and
Natsumi are actually Ail and An.

282
00:16:45,015 --> 00:16:47,148
I understand how you
feel Usagi, but...

283
00:16:47,182 --> 00:16:50,348
No, no you don't.
I'm going there
again to look around.

284
00:16:50,382 --> 00:16:53,115
It's dangerous!

285
00:16:53,148 --> 00:16:56,182
Well, maybe I'll
go there some
other time.

286
00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:59,115
[sign]
She just makes
me crazy!

287
00:16:59,148 --> 00:17:01,348
Hey! What's up,
Bun-Head!

288
00:17:01,382 --> 00:17:05,115
Hi! Mamoru!
Where are you
going?

289
00:17:05,148 --> 00:17:06,982
Right there.

290
00:17:07,015 --> 00:17:08,448
Huh?

291
00:17:08,482 --> 00:17:12,682
I heard Natsumi isn't
feeling well and has been
staying home from school.

292
00:17:12,715 --> 00:17:16,448
That's not true!
I don't know where you
heard that, but she's
faking it!

293
00:17:16,482 --> 00:17:17,915
Mm?

294
00:17:17,948 --> 00:17:23,682
[small cry]
Why would you even be
thinking about her in
the first place?

295
00:17:23,715 --> 00:17:29,182
Well, she did help us in
putting together that Snow White
play, so I thought this would be
a chance to thank her.

296
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:33,315
Ah-h! Wait! She has a
Makai Tree inside her
apartment!

297
00:17:33,348 --> 00:17:35,482
It'll take away your
energy if you're not
careful!

298
00:17:35,515 --> 00:17:40,482
Wow, an evil tree?
Now I've heard everything.
[chuckles]

299
00:17:40,515 --> 00:17:44,648
I'm serious!
Mamaru!

300
00:17:44,682 --> 00:17:45,682
Wait, Usagi!

301
00:17:49,148 --> 00:17:53,482
Oh you came all this
way to check up on me?
Why would you do that?

302
00:17:53,515 --> 00:17:57,282
Friends worry when friends
get sick, and just wanted to
see if you were all right.

303
00:17:57,315 --> 00:18:03,082
I don't know what it is, but I
have this warm feeling around
my heart.

304
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:05,448
You should go back
home now, while you
still can.

305
00:18:05,482 --> 00:18:08,415
Oh, how nice to see
you back again so soon.

306
00:18:08,448 --> 00:18:11,148
And since you're here,
won't you please come
in and stay awhile?

307
00:18:11,182 --> 00:18:12,248
Huh!?

308
00:18:12,282 --> 00:18:15,382
(Ail)
Oh, Usagi,
you're here
again!

309
00:18:15,415 --> 00:18:19,648
Please stay for tea.
I saved the meat buns
and cake for you from
last time.

310
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:20,648
Great!

311
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:23,715
All right! I hope
I get to eat
them this time!

312
00:18:23,748 --> 00:18:28,582
[chewing]

313
00:18:28,615 --> 00:18:34,215
I need to find a way to
get her alone with the
Makai Tree. But how?

314
00:18:34,248 --> 00:18:38,248
[chewing]
Wow! What a
great view.

315
00:18:38,282 --> 00:18:41,182
You can get an even better
view standing on the balcony.

316
00:18:41,215 --> 00:18:45,215
Why don't you show him
the view from outside,
brother?

317
00:18:45,248 --> 00:18:48,082
Hm?
Right.

318
00:18:48,115 --> 00:18:51,415
Hmm, That'll do.

319
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:55,115
Ah-h!
Tsukino.

320
00:18:55,148 --> 00:18:56,215
Huh?

321
00:18:56,248 --> 00:18:58,615
There's something
interesting that
I want you to see.

322
00:18:58,648 --> 00:18:59,915
Oh?

323
00:18:59,948 --> 00:19:04,315
It's there, just inside
that room you were curious
about before.

324
00:19:07,348 --> 00:19:14,182
What should I do?
I want to go inside,
but it's probably
dangerous.

325
00:19:14,215 --> 00:19:18,682
The truth is.. We're being
threatened by something
behind that door that's
very frightening.

326
00:19:18,715 --> 00:19:20,148
Something
frightening?

327
00:19:20,182 --> 00:19:22,282
Yes, it's been
living in that
room.

328
00:19:22,315 --> 00:19:23,615
[scared groan]

329
00:19:23,648 --> 00:19:27,315
But it's asleep now,
so it's safe to go in.
C'mon.

330
00:19:27,348 --> 00:19:28,548
Uhh..

331
00:19:31,115 --> 00:19:33,715
Maybe we should do
this another time.
[scared chuckle]

332
00:19:33,748 --> 00:19:35,415
Now is the
best time.

333
00:19:37,082 --> 00:19:39,248
[yells]

334
00:19:39,282 --> 00:19:42,582
Yamandakka,
make sure this girl
doesn't get away!

335
00:19:42,615 --> 00:19:44,648
What?!

336
00:19:44,682 --> 00:19:47,115
Dakka!

337
00:19:47,148 --> 00:19:51,115
[scream]

338
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:56,548
(Makai Tree)
I can't take it anymore!
Enough! Enough! Enough!

339
00:19:56,582 --> 00:19:59,348
Dak.. Ka?

340
00:19:59,382 --> 00:20:03,915
(Makai Tree)
Enough of this!
[screams]

341
00:20:09,348 --> 00:20:10,115
[gasp]

342
00:20:10,148 --> 00:20:10,848
[gasp]
What's
wrong?!

343
00:20:10,882 --> 00:20:13,348
Hey! What's going
on in there?!

344
00:20:13,382 --> 00:20:14,315
[yells]

345
00:20:14,348 --> 00:20:17,448
This wasn't
supposed to
happen!
[screams]

346
00:20:17,482 --> 00:20:20,582
Help me!
[yells]

347
00:20:20,615 --> 00:20:22,282
[groan]
Bun-Head?!

348
00:20:22,315 --> 00:20:23,515
Usagi!

349
00:20:23,548 --> 00:20:25,315
[struggling yell]

350
00:20:25,348 --> 00:20:28,215
Yamandakka!

351
00:20:28,248 --> 00:20:30,482
[screams]

352
00:20:30,515 --> 00:20:33,548
Dak.. ka.

353
00:20:40,515 --> 00:20:42,048
What's going on?

354
00:20:42,082 --> 00:20:43,948
It's huge!

355
00:20:43,982 --> 00:20:46,415
We can't get inside
with this thing
blocking us!

356
00:20:46,448 --> 00:20:48,482
Everyone
transform!

357
00:20:48,515 --> 00:20:49,348
Got it!

358
00:20:49,382 --> 00:20:51,448
Mars Power!

359
00:20:51,482 --> 00:20:53,282
Mercury Power!

360
00:20:53,315 --> 00:20:55,015
Venus Power!

361
00:20:55,048 --> 00:20:57,015
Jupiter Power!

362
00:20:57,048 --> 00:20:59,582
Make up!

363
00:21:13,315 --> 00:21:15,515
Sailor Mars!

364
00:21:23,982 --> 00:21:27,515
Sailor Mercury!

365
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:45,482
Sailor Venus!

366
00:21:55,115 --> 00:21:59,415
Sailor Jupiter!

367
00:22:03,482 --> 00:22:05,548
Let me handle this one.

368
00:22:06,982 --> 00:22:09,615
Supreme...

369
00:22:14,315 --> 00:22:16,282
...Thunder!

370
00:22:21,148 --> 00:22:22,548
It didn't work!

371
00:22:22,582 --> 00:22:23,715
(Usagi)
[screaming]

372
00:22:23,748 --> 00:22:25,015
[gasp]

373
00:22:25,048 --> 00:22:30,950
(Usagi)
[continued screaming]

374
00:24:11,525 --> 00:24:13,659
Seijuro is Ail...

375
00:24:13,692 --> 00:24:15,392
...And Natsumi is An.

376
00:24:15,425 --> 00:24:19,825
You two, please stop the
Makai Tree! Don't hurt
anyone anymore!

377
00:24:19,859 --> 00:24:21,159
Usagi...

378
00:24:21,192 --> 00:24:25,525
I don't care what happens
to me. Just spare everyone
else! Please!

379
00:24:25,559 --> 00:24:32,459
Next time on Sailor Moon R:
"True Love Awakens: The Makai
Tree's Secret."

380
00:24:32,492 --> 00:24:34,973
The moonlight is a
messenger of love.
