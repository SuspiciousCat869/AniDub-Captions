1
00:01:57,931 --> 00:02:02,497
<i>I finally got a chance to be</i>
alone with Mamoru at the virtual
<i>reality theatre.</i>

2
00:02:02,531 --> 00:02:04,697
<i>So why did all of you have to</i>
<i>show up and spoil it?</i>

3
00:02:04,731 --> 00:02:12,464
It was just the two of us until
Dad, Shingo, Natsumi, and even a
Cardian butted in. I can't take
<i>it anymore!</i>

4
00:02:12,497 --> 00:02:15,497
So in the name of the Moon,
I'll punish you!

5
00:02:18,731 --> 00:02:20,131
Usagi!!

6
00:02:21,397 --> 00:02:24,764
You have been snoozing
long enough! It's time to
get up!

7
00:02:25,197 --> 00:02:26,864
Whoa!
[Cat Hiss]

8
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:29,731
Aw but there's no
school today!

9
00:02:29,764 --> 00:02:33,531
What kind of excuse is that?
It's a lovely day and you should
be up enjoying it.

10
00:02:33,564 --> 00:02:35,697
Your father and Shingo
are already out. C'mon!

11
00:02:35,731 --> 00:02:40,197
But I'm still sleepy! You
are so mean! Give
me back my blanket!

12
00:02:40,831 --> 00:02:42,364
[Sigh]

13
00:02:42,597 --> 00:02:44,097
[Sigh]

14
00:02:50,231 --> 00:02:53,564
"Usagi's Crisis: The Tiara
Stops Working."

15
00:03:03,364 --> 00:03:09,531
We haven't collected as much
energy for the Makai Tree as I
had hoped because of those
Sailor Guardians interfering.

16
00:03:10,264 --> 00:03:15,097
We both well know the Makai Tree
is the source of our life energy
and if it withers...

17
00:03:15,131 --> 00:03:17,697
...then we too will
slowly wither and die.

18
00:03:28,264 --> 00:03:29,531
What are you doing?

19
00:03:30,531 --> 00:03:31,264
Huh?

20
00:03:32,564 --> 00:03:36,664
<i>"Virtual Reality Theatre Now</i>
<i>Open In Juban District."</i>

21
00:03:36,697 --> 00:03:42,231
Doesn't that sound like a
perfectly charming spot for a
Cardian to bare its
energy-zapping fangs?

22
00:03:42,497 --> 00:03:45,497
Hm! Well why don't we take a
little trip into town Ail...

23
00:03:45,531 --> 00:03:48,264
...and seek out some
new energy from this place?

24
00:03:53,164 --> 00:03:56,831
Oh, so this is that new thingy
where the games are supposed to
be like real...

25
00:03:56,864 --> 00:03:58,831
...but they aren't <i>really</i>
real or something?

26
00:03:58,864 --> 00:04:01,697
It's called a 'Virtual
Reality Theater.'

27
00:04:01,731 --> 00:04:03,264
Yeah I know that!

28
00:04:03,297 --> 00:04:05,197
It's basically an
oversized arcade!

29
00:04:05,231 --> 00:04:10,664
Well, it's time I showed you
the gaming skills that earned
me the title, <i>"Demon of the</i>
Arcade!"

30
00:04:10,864 --> 00:04:14,197
I invited Rei and
the others but I guess
they're not here yet.

31
00:04:20,631 --> 00:04:23,331
[Sigh]
All I see are couples.

32
00:04:23,364 --> 00:04:26,764
Let's skip it Luna. It's
just pretend war anyway.

33
00:04:26,797 --> 00:04:31,531
But that's the whole point of
being here, you still haven't
regained your sense of duty as a
Guardian.

34
00:04:31,564 --> 00:04:34,131
And maybe this will help you
build up your fighting skills.

35
00:04:34,164 --> 00:04:36,497
But I don't want to
work on my fighting skills!

36
00:04:36,531 --> 00:04:39,731
Although I might consider it
if I were here on a date
with Mamoru.

37
00:04:40,597 --> 00:04:42,164
Come on!

38
00:04:43,831 --> 00:04:46,764
You actually know how to restore
every single one of Mamoru's
memories, don't you Luna?

39
00:04:47,331 --> 00:04:48,564
<i>Tell me the truth!</i>

40
00:04:48,597 --> 00:04:51,197
<i>Out with it!</i>
<i>C'mon, c'mon! Fess up!</i>

41
00:04:51,231 --> 00:04:54,164
Don't take out your
frustrations on that poor
little cat.

42
00:04:54,197 --> 00:04:55,331
[Gasp]

43
00:04:56,397 --> 00:04:58,431
It's not the cat's fault
that you can't get a date.

44
00:05:00,464 --> 00:05:02,731
Don't you have anything better
to do with your free time like
go to the library and study,
Bun-head?

45
00:05:03,464 --> 00:05:05,131
It's none of your
business!

46
00:05:05,164 --> 00:05:07,164
I could get a date
if I wanted to!

47
00:05:07,197 --> 00:05:09,397
Sure!
Of course you could.

48
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:13,597
Huh?

49
00:05:14,997 --> 00:05:18,797
Wait a minute!
From the looks of it he plans
to go in alone, too!

50
00:05:19,397 --> 00:05:21,531
I wonder if I
should take a chance?

51
00:05:21,564 --> 00:05:24,364
Oh, why not?!

52
00:05:24,397 --> 00:05:27,831
I won't stop trying
until I succeed!
Here I go!

53
00:05:27,864 --> 00:05:32,797
<i>Why can't she show that</i>
<i>kind of initiative during</i>
<i>battle? [Sigh]</i>

54
00:05:33,397 --> 00:05:36,564
Hold on, Sir. You have
to wait in line like
everyone else.

55
00:05:38,197 --> 00:05:40,331
Woah!

56
00:05:42,331 --> 00:05:46,131
What do you think you're doing?
I have no intention of going in
there with you. You are not my
date!

57
00:05:46,164 --> 00:05:48,697
Yeah?
You should be so lucky!

58
00:05:49,231 --> 00:05:52,131
<i>Quit trying to pick</i>
<i>up girls who don't want</i>
<i>to go out with you.</i>

59
00:05:54,131 --> 00:05:55,797
It's really pitiful.

60
00:05:56,197 --> 00:05:57,764
What did you
say to me?

61
00:06:02,531 --> 00:06:04,464
[Grunts]

62
00:06:10,364 --> 00:06:13,097
Ahh!
You have stupid-pants!

63
00:06:13,297 --> 00:06:14,464
Mamoru!

64
00:06:15,864 --> 00:06:18,431
I owe you such a big debt of
gratitude! You really came to my
rescue!

65
00:06:18,864 --> 00:06:22,264
And as my way of saying thank
you, I'll be your date today!

66
00:06:22,297 --> 00:06:23,131
Huh?

67
00:06:23,164 --> 00:06:24,564
Hold on a minute!

68
00:06:24,597 --> 00:06:25,597
He's with me!

69
00:06:25,631 --> 00:06:29,164
Natsumi? What is
going on here?

70
00:06:29,197 --> 00:06:32,464
[Giggling]
Meet my brother, guys.

71
00:06:32,764 --> 00:06:34,564
I've met Usagi.

72
00:06:34,597 --> 00:06:37,097
I don't believe you know
Mamoru Chiba, though.

73
00:06:37,131 --> 00:06:39,731
He really would like to come
join us for this event.

74
00:06:39,764 --> 00:06:41,097
I'm actually busy, so...

75
00:06:41,297 --> 00:06:42,531
I'm gonna join you two...

76
00:06:42,564 --> 00:06:44,531
...then we can have a triple
date together!

77
00:06:44,564 --> 00:06:45,831
[Laughing]

78
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:47,097
Tsukino!

79
00:06:47,131 --> 00:06:48,464
Natsumi!

80
00:06:49,231 --> 00:06:50,764
This isn't a game.

81
00:06:51,231 --> 00:06:53,797
Yeah but this way
we'll attract less attention!

82
00:06:54,364 --> 00:06:56,197
I'm not too sure
about that.

83
00:06:56,231 --> 00:06:58,664
Let's go!
Come on! [Giggling]

84
00:07:01,231 --> 00:07:04,597
Well, maybe this arrangement
isn't so bad after all.

85
00:07:04,831 --> 00:07:06,431
<i>Hey, where are you guys</i>
<i>going!?</i>

86
00:07:06,464 --> 00:07:08,597
<i>Back of the line like the rest</i>
<i>of us!</i>

87
00:07:08,631 --> 00:07:11,364
Special VIP guests follow
me. Right this way.

88
00:07:11,397 --> 00:07:14,297
We're sure lucky!
Let's go Mamoru. Thanks!

89
00:07:15,397 --> 00:07:17,497
Hey, what about me?

90
00:07:17,531 --> 00:07:18,664
Luna!

91
00:07:18,697 --> 00:07:19,297
Huh?

92
00:07:21,564 --> 00:07:23,197
Oh good!
They're all here!

93
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:28,831
[Screams]

94
00:07:28,864 --> 00:07:30,731
Fire!
Get 'em, Dad!

95
00:07:32,331 --> 00:07:34,531
It's so bright!
What's happening now?

96
00:07:34,564 --> 00:07:36,664
[Scream]
Mamoru, I'm scared!

97
00:07:36,697 --> 00:07:38,297
<i>Hey get your hands</i>
<i>off of him!</i>

98
00:07:38,331 --> 00:07:39,097
Huh?

99
00:07:39,131 --> 00:07:40,731
He was just comforting me,
calm down!

100
00:07:40,764 --> 00:07:42,397
Usagi?!

101
00:07:42,431 --> 00:07:44,397
Dad?!
Is that you?

102
00:07:46,131 --> 00:07:49,697
Shingo? Did you talk Dad into
bringing you here? This place
isn't for little kids Shingo!

103
00:07:49,731 --> 00:07:53,664
Cut it out, I'm doing fine.
But aren't these high-tech games
over your head?

104
00:07:53,697 --> 00:07:55,697
Don't be such a
wise guy!

105
00:07:57,631 --> 00:07:59,631
[Screaming]

106

[Gasp]

108
00:08:01,897 --> 00:08:03,564
What are you doing,
brother?

109
00:08:03,597 --> 00:08:05,564
It, it was an
accident.

110
00:08:05,597 --> 00:08:08,731
[Giggling]
It just sort of
happened, sorry.

111
00:08:09,631 --> 00:08:13,631
Usagi! I don't know what
you're doing with those boys...

112
00:08:13,664 --> 00:08:16,264
...but Dad trusts you,
you hear me?

113
00:08:16,297 --> 00:08:17,831
It's not like that.

114
00:08:20,897 --> 00:08:23,431
How long are we gonna
have to wait to get in?

115
00:08:23,464 --> 00:08:25,797
They say "Good things come
to those who stay!"

116
00:08:25,831 --> 00:08:28,497
I think you mean good
things come to those who wait.

117
00:08:28,531 --> 00:08:29,464
[Sigh]

118
00:08:35,197 --> 00:08:39,664
I'm the <i>cool</i> Grade School Boy,
Sneaker Shingo, who fights for
justice...

00:08:39,864 --> 00:08:43,331
...In the name of the Moon,
I'll punish you!

120
00:08:58,264 --> 00:08:59,864
Nice shot Dad.
You got 'em!

121
00:08:59,897 --> 00:09:01,264
Yeah! Cool!

122
00:09:01,697 --> 00:09:03,397
Where'd Usagi go?

123
00:09:07,197 --> 00:09:10,864
[Excited Giggles]
I got the monster!
[Singing] Na-na-na-na-na

124
00:09:10,897 --> 00:09:11,797
[Grunts]

125
00:09:12,664 --> 00:09:15,464
Dad!!
[Giggling] So, so shall we move
on?

126
00:09:17,197 --> 00:09:20,664
He made a big deal of saying he
would trust me but he really
doesn't.

127
00:09:20,697 --> 00:09:26,797
Don't worry Ail! It's an act so
we look like we're only here to
have fun like everybody else.

128
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:02,197
Awesome!

129
00:10:03,497 --> 00:10:05,331
They are both so way cool!
Just as I expected, my guy's a
natural.

130
00:10:05,364 --> 00:10:06,497
Well!
<i>I'm</i> a natural too!

131
00:10:09,164 --> 00:10:10,531
[Screams]

132
00:10:10,564 --> 00:10:12,697
Nice try, Tsukino.
Too bad you missed!

133
00:10:13,331 --> 00:10:17,364
I just need a little practice, I
don't go shooting for fun it's
so barbaric.

134
00:10:17,564 --> 00:10:21,564
Ah, what a shame! Of course in
all things, what really counts
is winning.

135
00:10:21,597 --> 00:10:25,097
So you might as well admit
defeat right now because you're
clearly not a winner.

136
00:10:25,364 --> 00:10:26,597
What?!

137
00:10:27,397 --> 00:10:29,597
[Grunting]

138
00:10:29,631 --> 00:10:30,664
[Screaming]
Ow!

139
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:35,264
Oh, this is so nice.
I'd love to stay like this a
little bit longer.

140
00:10:35,497 --> 00:10:38,231
Not gonna happen.
Now go on.

141
00:10:38,264 --> 00:10:39,231
[Sigh]

142
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:43,364
You can't make people like you
by forcing yourself upon them
every chance you get.

143
00:10:43,764 --> 00:10:47,064
Well said. Good
for you Mamoru.

[Screams]

145
00:10:49,731 --> 00:10:51,597
Come back Bun-head!
You're gonna get lost in
that maze!

146
00:10:57,564 --> 00:11:01,597
[Exhales] Love is just a game.
I play to win. Right?

147
00:11:02,297 --> 00:11:03,331
[Grunt]

148
00:11:04,797 --> 00:11:08,731
My body seeks energy. I'm
getting pretty close to
being totally depleted.

149
00:11:08,764 --> 00:11:11,564
You think everything has to
be a game, but this isn't!

150
00:11:11,764 --> 00:11:15,831

315
00:24:16,009 --> 00:24:18,809
<i>Yup! And couples sharing a</i>
<i>romantic moment together!</i>

00:24:18,842 --> 00:24:21,275

<i>Even if they do, I can</i>
<i>handle them!</i>

318
00:24:23,275 --> 00:24:25,209
<i>Oh no, my transformation</i>

00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:31,742
<i>Next time on Sailor Moon R:"A</i>
<i>New Transformation: Usagi's</i>
<i>Power Up."</i>

00:24:32,909 --> 00:24:35,250
The moonlight is a
messenger of love.
