154
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:08,741
We're only willing to
do that if you promise
to stop your mission to
eliminate them!

155
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:09,642
No way!

156
00:10:09,676 --> 00:10:12,445
Why are you even
suggesting such
a thing?!

157
00:10:13,513 --> 00:10:18,184
We have come to realize
the true nature of that
man, Rubeus, and the
Black Moon Clan!

158
00:10:18,251 --> 00:10:22,155
It's frightening!
The clan is willing
to destroy everything!

159
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:25,091
As long as it can
achieve its own
ends!

160
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:29,696
That, my dear sister,
is merely the nature
of battle, where the
victor is always right...

161
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:32,132
...And love and
friendship mean
nothing!

162
00:10:32,165 --> 00:10:33,466
Now die!

163
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:35,235
Not so fast!

164
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:38,404
Hate to tell you,
but you've got it
all wrong!

165
00:10:38,438 --> 00:10:39,572
Sailor Moon!

166
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:42,742
We fight for the sake
of protecting this
lovely planet!

167
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:45,311
For all kind-
hearted people!

168
00:10:45,345 --> 00:10:48,281
For trees, flowers,
and all of nature's
creations!

169
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:51,084
For love, happiness,
and a beautiful future.

170
00:10:51,251 --> 00:10:52,986
You wanna trample
all that?

171
00:10:55,288 --> 00:10:56,956
Not while I'm around!

172
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:00,493
Now, in the name
of the Moon...

173
00:11:00,527 --> 00:11:02,095
...We'll punish you!

174
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:05,365
Hmph! You're so
predictable! We
prepared for you

175
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:06,566
to come looking
for these two.

176
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:08,501
Didn't you know
this was a trap?

177
00:11:08,535 --> 00:11:10,537
We knew, but we
followed you here
anyway!

178
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:13,506
We want our friends
back! Please return
them to us!

179
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,475
Sailor Mercury...

180
00:11:15,475 --> 00:11:17,810
Your so-called friends
are our traitor sisters!

181
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:19,812
I'm tired of all
this nonsense!

182
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:22,649
Dark Thunder!

183
00:11:22,815 --> 00:11:23,583
Hnnh!

184
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,486
Oh! Wow!

185
00:11:26,586 --> 00:11:28,588
Let me try! I wanna
know what it feels
like!

186
00:11:28,655 --> 00:11:30,223
It's mine!
Back off!

187
00:11:30,256 --> 00:11:32,325
Dark Thunder!

188
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:34,327
[screaming]

189
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,094
Hah!

190
00:11:35,328 --> 00:11:36,596
[screaming]

191
00:11:37,664 --> 00:11:39,165
[chuckling]

192
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:40,567
Petz and Calaveras...

193
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,703
When you aren't able
to finish the job,
I will.

194
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:45,405
[chuckling]

195
00:11:49,309 --> 00:11:52,312
Sailor Moon R!

196
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:08,394
Sailor Moon R!

197
00:12:10,463 --> 00:12:12,332
Dark Thunder!

198
00:12:12,432 --> 00:12:13,733
[screaming]

199
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:16,469
[groaning]

200
00:12:16,536 --> 00:12:17,737
Is everyone
all right?

201
00:12:18,271 --> 00:12:19,706
What incredible power!

202
00:12:19,706 --> 00:12:22,208
Let's fight thunder
with thunder!

203
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:25,945
Sparkling Wide
Pressure!

204
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:27,714
Dark Thunder!

205
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:30,717
[screaming]

206
00:12:31,451 --> 00:12:32,719
Are you all right?

207
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:36,256
Been better. She's
several degrees more
powerful than last time.

208
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:37,724
Wait a minute...

209
00:12:39,292 --> 00:12:43,630
I've found the source
of that power. Her stick
is radiating an immense
energy!

210
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:46,232
So if we're able to
get it away from her...

211
00:12:46,232 --> 00:12:48,568
...Her power should
return to normal.

212
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,236
Leave it to me!

213
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:57,977
Venus Love Me Chain!

214
00:12:59,712 --> 00:13:00,713
I missed her!

215
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,215
She's moving too fast!

216
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:05,218
Burning...

217
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:10,456
...Mandala!

218
00:13:10,556 --> 00:13:11,624
[grunting]

219
00:13:11,658 --> 00:13:12,392
Whoa!

220
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:14,694
[gasps]

221
00:13:14,827 --> 00:13:16,462
Dark Thunder!

222
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,031
[screaming]

223
00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:24,103
[chuckling]

224
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:26,105
I'll put you out of
your misery now.

225
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:28,708
Stop, Sister!
Enough already!

226
00:13:28,775 --> 00:13:32,278
Forget what Rubeus
told you! Don't do
this anymore!

227
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:35,515
Once you've done what
he asks, he won't give
you a second thought!

228
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:38,151
He'll try to get rid
of both of you, like
he did with us!

229
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:39,485
You can't trust him!

230
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:42,055
Please believe us!
We are telling you
the truth!

231
00:13:42,121 --> 00:13:43,122
Just listen!

232
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,692
You two always think
you know more than us.

233
00:13:45,725 --> 00:13:49,195
Are you trying to mess
with our heads so we
fail in our mission?

234
00:13:49,462 --> 00:13:50,463
That's not it!

235
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:53,032
We're only telling you
all this for your own
good!

236
00:13:53,366 --> 00:13:56,169
Now I'm telling you.
You've outlived your
usefulness.

237
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:59,706
And I really don't care
to listen to your stupid
nonsense anymore.

238
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:05,178
Sister, these two are
really annoying. Don't
you think it's time you
got rid of these irritants?

239
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:08,081
Hmph! Why not?!

240
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:11,050
Dark Thunder!

241
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:12,051
[gasp]

242
00:14:12,452 --> 00:14:13,219
[screaming]

243
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:15,254
Sister, stop!
What are you
doing?!

244
00:14:15,288 --> 00:14:18,758
You have ridiculed and
laughed at me for as
long as I can remember,

245
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:20,793
but it doesn't look
like you're laughing
now.

246
00:14:20,893 --> 00:14:23,062
Ah! Forgive me!

247
00:14:23,396 --> 00:14:26,966
With this stick, my
powers are strong
beyond compare!

248
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:31,938
Soon, I will surpass
Master Rubeus. I may
even become clan
leader!

249
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:36,275
You've always tried to
put me down. This time
I'm putting you down
permanently!

250
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:37,577
[laughing]

251
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:39,512
What's gotten
into you?

252
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:42,949
Go to hell with
the others! Traitor!

253
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:45,351
[screaming]

254
00:14:46,452 --> 00:14:47,053
Koan!

255
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:47,687
Berthier!

256
00:14:51,758 --> 00:14:53,192
Are you all right?

257
00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:54,127
Koan!

258
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:55,061
Yes...

259
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:57,230
Thank you,
Sailor Mars.

260
00:14:59,532 --> 00:15:02,502
I can't believe my
sister tried to kill me.

261
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:04,003
Are you all right?

262
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:08,141
Just moments ago we
were trying to kill
you. Why do you care?

263
00:15:08,174 --> 00:15:11,310
Being concerned when
someone's hurt feels
like the right thing
to do.

264
00:15:11,778 --> 00:15:14,747
It is common that
people do this sort of
thing in this world?

265
00:15:16,449 --> 00:15:20,353
That's right, you're
receiving the kind of
love that is part of
the human experience.

266
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:23,523
It's what we had
forgotten in the
Black Moon Clan.

267
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:27,126
But the Sailor
Guardians are here
to remind us of it.

268
00:15:29,462 --> 00:15:32,331
I've been so wrong
in how I've treated
my sisters.

269
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:37,970
What a mess! Earth
trash and Clan trash
all blending together.

270
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:39,772
What?!

271
00:15:39,806 --> 00:15:42,575
That's enough! You're
out of control and
we're gonna stop you!

272
00:15:42,642 --> 00:15:46,746
Trying to kill your
very own sisters? How
could you be so utterly
heartless?

273
00:15:46,746 --> 00:15:51,117
Hmph! They're useless
garbage! Never been
able to complete a
mission.

274
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:53,085
Just waste I need
to get rid of!

275
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:53,920
[growling]

276
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:56,456
No use trying to
talk sense into
her.

277
00:15:56,489 --> 00:15:59,091
Wait! Don't give
up on her just yet!

278
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:00,660
[gasp]

279
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:03,663
She's been completely
taken over by the
immense evil power
of that stick!

280
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:04,363
I knew it!

281
00:16:04,397 --> 00:16:06,699
What can we do
to change that?

282
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:09,402
I might know a way.
What we'll do is...

283
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:10,570
Go to hell!

284
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:12,538
...combine powers!

285
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:17,210
Bubble Spray!

286
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:19,212
Now!

287
00:16:19,245 --> 00:16:22,515
Okay! Venus Love
Me Chain!

288
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:23,416
Agh!

289
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:24,717
Jupiter!

290
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:25,318
Right!

291
00:16:25,885 --> 00:16:29,555
Sparkling Wide Pressure!

292
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:32,391
[painful grunts]

293
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:35,194
[laughing]

294
00:16:40,433 --> 00:16:41,334
[groaning]

295
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:42,702
Are you all
right, sister?

296
00:16:42,735 --> 00:16:44,504
Keep your hands
off me!

297
00:16:44,537 --> 00:16:47,974
I don't want your pity
now that my life has
been ruined!

298
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:49,509
Don't say that!

299
00:16:51,644 --> 00:16:53,379
Well done, Petz!

300
00:16:53,412 --> 00:16:55,081
Master Rubeus!
I can explain...

301
00:16:55,147 --> 00:17:00,386
You gathered the Sailor
Guardians and the traitors
together. Just as I hoped
you would.

302
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:03,823
In case you're wondering,
I always intended to take
the glory myself.

303
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:05,491
Huh?!

304
00:17:05,558 --> 00:17:09,462
Once the Sailor Guardians
are finally out of the
picture, I can do all the
rest.

305
00:17:09,495 --> 00:17:11,397
What about me?
Where do I fit in?

306
00:17:11,497 --> 00:17:13,633
You don't. People
like you are
expendable.

307
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:15,301
And replacements
are easy to get.

308
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:16,068
[gasp]

309
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:20,439
Go to hell with the
Sailor Guardians!

310
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:34,086
They're about to
experience the true
power of the stick.

311
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:36,956
Sucked into the tear
between dimensions.

312
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,062
[screaming]

313
00:17:49,302 --> 00:17:50,236
Ahh!

314
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:52,705
If this force keeps
up, we'll be sucked
in!

315
00:17:52,705 --> 00:17:54,106
What's causing this?!

316
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:57,610
When Petz was using
that stick, it was
giving off forward
motion power.

317
00:17:57,643 --> 00:18:00,279
He must have now
switch it into
reverse!

318
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:02,315
It's generating
a black hole?!

319
00:18:02,348 --> 00:18:04,283
Is there any way
to stop it?

320
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:06,185
Luna?!

321
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:09,522
He's created a
dimensional tear!
There's no way to
fix that!

322
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:12,024
Hold on, maybe
there is a way!

323
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:15,828
If I direct every ounce
of my remaining power
toward that stick, I

324
00:18:15,861 --> 00:18:20,499
might be able to destroy
it. T hen it's possible
that the black hole will
disappear!

325
00:18:20,533 --> 00:18:24,203
But that's extremely
risky! You could be
killed in the process!

326
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:27,039
Better to try, than
to lose your world
without a fight!

327
00:18:28,307 --> 00:18:30,443
Dark Power!

328
00:18:32,345 --> 00:18:33,145
[gasp]

329
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:34,647
[screaming]

330
00:18:36,682 --> 00:18:37,950
Calaveras!

331
00:18:39,185 --> 00:18:42,121
You know me, I just
can't bear to see you
get all the glory.

332
00:18:44,724 --> 00:18:46,058
Don't let go!

333
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:47,460
But why are you-?

334
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:52,031
I know in the past all
we did was fight with
one another, but we
were always together.

335
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:55,501
We wouldn't be the
Four Spectre Sisters
if one of us was
missing.

336
00:18:55,534 --> 00:18:56,369
[gasp]

337
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:05,444
[grunting]

338
00:19:06,512 --> 00:19:07,346
[screaming]

339
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:08,614
We're done for!

340
00:19:08,681 --> 00:19:10,516
Don't give up,
Sailor Moon!

341
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,618
Tuxedo Mask!

342
00:19:14,186 --> 00:19:17,189
If you put all your
powers together, I'm
sure you'll be able
to seal the tear

343
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:18,391
between the
dimensions.

344
00:19:19,191 --> 00:19:20,092
But how?!

345
00:19:20,126 --> 00:19:21,527
He's right! I get
what he's saying!

346
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,062
Huh?

347
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:26,032
We know that stick is
creating a funnel similar
to a black hole, and is

348
00:19:26,032 --> 00:19:28,267
trying to pull us
into another dimension.

349
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:34,273
...But if you surround it
and project your combined
energies to break it up,
that funnel should disappear!

350
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,342
To do that we'll
have to jump in
there!

351
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:40,346
I'm afraid that's the
only way to get the
job done! Let's go!

352
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:43,215
Everyone jump together
on the count of three!

353
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:45,518
One, two...

354
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:46,585
Three!

355
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,695
Where's the stick?!

356
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:59,231
If we don't find it
quickly, we'll be
thrown into another
dimension.

357
00:19:59,265 --> 00:19:59,965
There!

358
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,435
Hurry! Grab each
others hands!

359
00:20:03,736 --> 00:20:07,173
Now focus on that
stick and power up
everyone!

360
00:20:07,173 --> 00:20:09,408
Moon Crystal Power!

361
00:20:09,442 --> 00:20:11,043
Mars Star Power!

[screaming]

00:20:48,347 --> 00:20:49,348
Did it work?

368
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:52,251
Yes! The tear between
dimensions is gone!

369
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:54,220
[sighs of relief]

370
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:55,020
Huh?

371
00:20:55,688 --> 00:20:57,356
Thank you,
Tuxedo Mask.

372
00:20:59,225 --> 00:21:00,526
Sailor Moon!

373
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:03,763
I want all of us to
be together. Can
you help?

374
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:05,364
Mm-hm...

375
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:10,503
Moon Crystal Power!

376
00:21:16,509 --> 00:21:18,577
Refresh!

377
00:21:22,748 --> 00:21:27,319
Usagi has the Silver
Crystal and is Sailor
Moon.

378
00:21:28,187 --> 00:21:33,993
All this time... Sailor
Moon's had the Silver
Crystal!

379
00:21:35,261 --> 00:21:36,996
Agh! Curses!

380
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:43,502
Oh? The sisters
started their
own business?

381
00:21:43,569 --> 00:21:46,238
Yeah, they sell products
that are supposed to make
everyone beautiful.

382
00:21:46,272 --> 00:21:51,243
Hi! Would you like to
try a product that will
make you beautiful with
a money-back guarantee?

383
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:54,513
Berthier, if you don't
stop, you'll use up
all the products!

384
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:57,650
It's maintenance. I have
to use everything, so
my complexion is

385
00:21:57,683 --> 00:22:00,319
flawless, otherwise
our customers won't
believe us.

386
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,521
Well, believe this!

[arguing]

388
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:06,659
This is why I prefer
door-to-door sales!

389
00:22:07,393 --> 00:22:10,229
They say the more you
quarrel, the closer
you are.

390
00:22:10,262 --> 00:22:11,664
They're kinda
like us!

391
00:22:11,697 --> 00:22:14,333
Except they don't have
to put up with a certain
someone who's in her own

392
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,569
little world, and is
always competing with
me.

393
00:22:16,635 --> 00:22:18,704
Oh really? Who
would that be?

394
00:22:18,737 --> 00:22:22,074
Gee. I haven't got
a clue. Does it ring
a bell with anyone?

395
00:22:22,141 --> 00:22:22,808
Why you!

Why are you
being so mean?

400
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,315
I'm not! I'm
being honest!

401
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:30,649
Could you two just
cut it out!

402
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:32,151
She started it!

What am I going to do?
Chibi-Usa took my
transformation brooch!

00:24:15,688 --> 00:24:17,790
Get it back! It'll
put her life in danger!

Why? How come?

407
00:24:19,358 --> 00:24:22,795
The brooch contains the
Silver Crystal! What
if the enemy finds out?!

408
00:24:22,828 --> 00:24:28,233
Chibi-Usa! Give me back
my brooch now! I need
the Silver Crystal to
save everyone!
