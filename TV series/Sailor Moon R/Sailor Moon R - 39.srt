1
00:01:57,063 --> 00:02:00,800
Oh no! This just can't be!

2
00:02:00,867 --> 00:02:03,436
Chibi-Usa, is that really you?

3
00:02:04,571 --> 00:02:07,507
What are you doing?! Don't you
recognize us?

4
00:02:07,874 --> 00:02:11,044
Please stop it! I don't want to
fight you!

5
00:02:11,111 --> 00:02:12,912
We love you Chibi-Usa!

6
00:02:12,979 --> 00:02:16,516
In the name of the Moon, I don't
want to punish you!

7
00:02:29,929 --> 00:02:31,131
Chibi-Usa!

8
00:02:31,431 --> 00:02:33,733
Chibi-Usa, where'd you go?

9
00:02:33,833 --> 00:02:34,701
Where are you?

10
00:02:35,035 --> 00:02:36,002
Any luck?

11
00:02:36,102 --> 00:02:37,971
No. We can't find
her anywhere!

12
00:02:38,038 --> 00:02:39,472
Think the enemy's
got her?

13
00:02:39,572 --> 00:02:40,073
[Gasps]

14
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:46,746
It's best if we don't jump
to conclusions just yet.

15
00:02:46,913 --> 00:02:48,448
We've got to keep looking!

16
00:02:48,548 --> 00:02:49,949
All right then,
let's split up.

17
00:02:50,016 --> 00:02:50,850
Mhmm.

18
00:02:57,824 --> 00:03:02,762
"The Dark Queen: Birth of
Black Lady"

19
00:03:09,969 --> 00:03:15,742
The horrible memories you have
from your past, have left you
with deep, painful scars.

20
00:03:15,842 --> 00:03:22,082
Small Lady, you remember
how your mean mother and your
cruel father always mistreated
you, don't you?

21
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:36,396
[Giggling]

22
00:03:36,996 --> 00:03:39,099
[Croaking]

23
00:03:39,499 --> 00:03:45,705
Oh wow! Look at that cute green
froggie! [Giggling]

24
00:03:45,805 --> 00:03:47,740
Don't run, or you
might trip and fall!

25
00:03:47,841 --> 00:03:49,843
[Giggling]
[Screams]

26
00:03:50,443 --> 00:03:51,144
[Gasps]

27
00:03:56,983 --> 00:03:57,851
Hmm?

28
00:03:58,985 --> 00:04:00,086
[Sigh]

29
00:04:01,354 --> 00:04:04,991
[Whimpering]

30
00:04:05,091 --> 00:04:06,926
[Crying]

31
00:04:07,494 --> 00:04:10,830
See? That is what can happen
when you don't listen to Mommy.

32
00:04:11,097 --> 00:04:15,435
[Crying]

33
00:04:15,869 --> 00:04:17,370
Crying won't help you.

34
00:04:17,437 --> 00:04:19,105
[Gasps]

35
00:04:20,373 --> 00:04:22,842
Oh Mommy I hate you!

36
00:04:22,909 --> 00:04:25,645
Daddy, help me up?

37
00:04:26,946 --> 00:04:28,081
Get up by yourself.

38
00:04:28,148 --> 00:04:29,549
[Gasps]

39
00:04:31,484 --> 00:04:37,090
Your parents never gave you a
helping hand. That act alone
proves that they never loved
you.

40
00:04:45,798 --> 00:04:47,967
It's your fault
for tripping.

41
00:04:48,067 --> 00:04:49,702
Now, get up!

42
00:04:50,937 --> 00:04:52,105
[Sigh]

43
00:04:54,941 --> 00:05:00,713
Think back and remember all the
many examples of those who have
hated you.

44
00:05:12,659 --> 00:05:15,695
What's wrong, Small Lady?
Why do you look so sad?

45
00:05:17,063 --> 00:05:20,700
Well, you see, today is my
birthday.

46
00:05:21,034 --> 00:05:22,101
Your birthday?

47
00:05:22,835 --> 00:05:23,870
Oh yeah, that's right.

48
00:05:24,971 --> 00:05:28,541
But Mommy and Daddy are doing
something very far away.

49
00:05:28,942 --> 00:05:34,781
These things happen. Both of
them must have just had
important official business
matters to attend to.

50
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:37,050
Otherwise, they would be
here to celebrate with you.

51
00:05:38,585 --> 00:05:43,022
[Crying]

52
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:44,958
[Sighs]

53
00:05:46,359 --> 00:05:48,761
Hey wait! Why don't we help her
celebrate.

54
00:05:48,828 --> 00:05:49,963
No!

55
00:05:50,029 --> 00:05:50,964
Huh?

56
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:52,632
We just can't.

57
00:05:52,832 --> 00:05:55,068
Oh that's right. Sorry,
Chibi-Usa.

58
00:05:55,134 --> 00:05:56,769
Yeah, we have to go.

59
00:05:56,836 --> 00:05:57,837
Bye, Small Lady.

60
00:06:01,774 --> 00:06:06,579
Everyone, they all, they all
just left me alone.

61
00:06:06,913 --> 00:06:10,617
Nobody celebrated with me. My
birthday was ignored.

62
00:06:11,618 --> 00:06:17,624
Yes, your memories are coming
back to you. You're right. No
one loves you.

63
00:06:21,961 --> 00:06:23,129
That's right.

64
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,868
No one cares about me.

65
00:06:32,739 --> 00:06:34,540
No one loves me.

66
00:06:37,977 --> 00:06:39,912
I'm all alone.

67
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,483
So, you hate them, don't you?

68
00:06:47,887 --> 00:06:49,088
[Grunts]

69
00:06:51,924 --> 00:06:55,828
Then set free that hatred on the
world that has rejected you.

70
00:06:55,928 --> 00:06:58,798
Shroud them in the gloom of
darkness forever!

71
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:05,071
Now, fill your heart with
darkness, and accept the power
of the Malefic Black Crystal.

72
00:07:05,138 --> 00:07:10,476
And use that awesome power to
destroy this world that refused
to love you!

73
00:07:57,957 --> 00:07:59,826
The time has come.

74
00:07:59,926 --> 00:08:01,027
Wiseman!

75
00:08:02,795 --> 00:08:05,898
Our Malefic Black Crystal now
has a faithful and formidable
servant in the Rabbit.

76
00:08:05,965 --> 00:08:12,438
As the recipient of unrivaled
power, the Rabbit has
transformed, and become
the queen of darkness.

77
00:08:12,672 --> 00:08:15,675
What? It can't be, you're the
Rabbit?

78
00:08:16,075 --> 00:08:16,843
Huh?

79
00:08:18,845 --> 00:08:21,614
[Gasp] She's wearing our clan
symbol!

80
00:08:22,115 --> 00:08:23,816
[Laughing]

81
00:08:24,417 --> 00:08:26,586
I am Black Lady!

82
00:08:27,487 --> 00:08:31,591
Demande! You must leave
immediately for 20th century
Earth.

83
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:38,831
Once you are there, Black Lady
will manifest her Dark Power.
With her darkness, you will be
able to conquer the world!

84
00:08:38,965 --> 00:08:40,833
[Laughing]

85
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:44,771
Hmph!

86
00:08:46,406 --> 00:08:51,711
Finally, Earth will feel the
full force of my anger. I will
have my revenge!

87
00:08:53,646 --> 00:08:54,680
Brother.

88
00:08:55,715 --> 00:08:58,584
You would do well to be
very cautious of Wiseman.

89
00:08:58,684 --> 00:08:59,652
Hmm.

90
00:09:00,853 --> 00:09:04,424
I believe that he was
responsible for Esmeraude's
death.

91
00:09:04,824 --> 00:09:06,526
Wiseman used her.

92
00:09:06,793 --> 00:09:09,562
Used her? Absurd.

93
00:09:10,663 --> 00:09:15,401
We were exiled, forced to live
on this distant planet because
of the people of Earth!

94
00:09:15,635 --> 00:09:19,939
I would trade the lives of
thousands to have my revenge on
those damn humans!

95
00:09:21,507 --> 00:09:25,845
But don't you see it? Wiseman's
actions have shown that he just
can't be trusted!

96
00:09:25,945 --> 00:09:27,380
You're wrong!

97
00:09:28,548 --> 00:09:30,616
Wiseman has supported us by
sharing important information...

98
00:09:30,683 --> 00:09:33,653
...and providing us with the
energy of the Malefic Black
Crystal.

99
00:09:33,953 --> 00:09:37,457
With everything that's at stake
in this, who else would you have
me trust?

100
00:09:37,857 --> 00:09:39,792
We are so close now.

101
00:09:42,662 --> 00:09:45,097
Those four Sailor Guardians are
the problem.

102
00:09:45,398 --> 00:09:48,568
They are the only ones keeping
us from winning this war!

103
00:09:48,801 --> 00:09:50,903
We must defeat them to succeed.

104
00:09:51,704 --> 00:09:56,709
I believe the best way to
conquer Crystal Tokyo is by
destroying their world in the
past.

105
00:09:57,977 --> 00:10:04,717
Now that the Rabbit has become
Black Lady and truly serves the
Malefic Black Crystal, we must
seize this chance!

106
00:10:04,817 --> 00:10:09,822
So I will now leave for the past
to join her in building a Dark
Gate on their precious Earth.

107
00:10:12,692 --> 00:10:17,363
As for you my dear brother,
you will assist our efforts by
protecting the reactor...

108
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:21,567
...and amplifying the Malefic
Black Crystal's energy until the
Dark Gate opens.

109
00:10:21,834 --> 00:10:22,935
I will.

110
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:25,605
Then onward.

111
00:10:25,805 --> 00:10:27,473
Yes!

112
00:10:29,575 --> 00:10:32,111
What?! Chibi-Usa went back into
the past?!

113
00:10:32,578 --> 00:10:36,649
Yes she did. And it also appears
that Demande followed her there,
as well.

114
00:10:37,383 --> 00:10:38,484
Demande?!

115
00:10:38,551 --> 00:10:39,619
That can't be good.

116
00:10:39,819 --> 00:10:42,688
Small Lady was not acting like
herself.

117
00:10:42,922 --> 00:10:44,557
What do you mean?!

118
00:10:45,758 --> 00:10:48,094
Something must have happened to
her, something that changed her!

119
00:10:48,761 --> 00:10:51,631
You must return to the past
immediately!

120
00:10:52,965 --> 00:10:54,433
[All] Huh?

121
00:11:05,778 --> 00:11:10,816
[Quite Gasps]

122
00:11:14,687 --> 00:11:18,591
Sailor Pluto, what was the
cataclysmic event that
occurred on Earth?

123
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:23,396
What happened during the time
before we became kings and
queens and built Crystal
Tokyo?

124
00:11:23,563 --> 00:11:26,666
Is there any way for us to
prevent this disaster from
happening?

125
00:11:26,732 --> 00:11:33,105
All of you have seen a glimpse
of the future. But it is best
that you not know exactly what
the future holds.

126
00:11:33,573 --> 00:11:38,077
What is important is that you
continue to believe that good
things will come your way...

127
00:11:38,144 --> 00:11:44,584
...and live your lives to the
fullest in your own time,
unburdened by what the future
may bring.

128
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:54,060
Sailor Moon R!

129
00:12:07,867 --> 00:12:10,737
Sailor Moon R!

130
00:12:22,237 --> 00:12:23,238
Where are we?

131
00:12:23,305 --> 00:12:25,140
We're back in the
Juban District.

132
00:12:25,741 --> 00:12:26,675
Oh.

133
00:12:27,709 --> 00:12:29,945
You're right! Look how
lovely the moon is!

134
00:12:34,116 --> 00:12:38,854
[Sigh] Thank goodness, how nice
to be in a peaceful place.

135
00:12:38,921 --> 00:12:40,823
Let's keep it a
peaceful place.

136
00:12:40,889 --> 00:12:41,790
Hmm.

137
00:12:43,725 --> 00:12:46,728
First things first. We've gotta
figure out what Demande's
planning to do here in the
present.

138
00:12:46,995 --> 00:12:49,231
And we have to find
Chibi-Usa as well!

139
00:12:53,902 --> 00:12:58,740
Chibi-Usa, wherever you are, I
hope you're okay.

140
00:13:10,986 --> 00:13:16,892
Now to fulfill my dream and
wreak my vengeance on Earth.
[Chuckling]

141
00:13:48,924 --> 00:13:50,659
Look at all that evil energy!

142
00:13:50,792 --> 00:13:53,996
It appears as if Demande is
trying to create a new Dark
Gate.

143
00:13:54,062 --> 00:13:55,697
We gotta stop him!

144
00:13:56,031 --> 00:13:58,667
[Heavy Breathing]

145
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:03,038
[Grunts]

146
00:14:03,872 --> 00:14:05,707
[Gasp] What's that?

147
00:14:11,647 --> 00:14:13,982
Sailor Guardians, stop
where you are!

148
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:16,218
What?! Wait, who are you?

149
00:14:18,153 --> 00:14:23,659
Who am I? I am the Queen of
Darkness, created by the great
Wiseman. I am known as Black
Lady.

150
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:24,993
Black Lady?

151
00:14:25,994 --> 00:14:27,129
Huh?

152
00:14:28,931 --> 00:14:32,968
Using the Malefic Black Crystal,
I will turn the Earth into a
world of permanent darkness.

153
00:14:33,735 --> 00:14:34,970
[Gasps]

154
00:14:40,609 --> 00:14:45,580
Ahh, Luna P! So at least you
still recognize me!

155
00:14:48,984 --> 00:14:51,954
You were the only one I could
ever call a true friend.

156
00:14:52,087 --> 00:14:53,021
[Gasp]

157
00:14:56,658 --> 00:14:58,093
Is it possible? Are you?

158
00:14:58,727 --> 00:15:00,028
Are you Chibi-Usa?

159
00:15:01,663 --> 00:15:05,133
[Laughing] I guess I may have
been called by that name at an
earlier time.

160
00:15:05,634 --> 00:15:06,868
This can't be!

161
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:11,139
There's no way! Our Chibi-Usa
would never grow up to be like
you!

162
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:15,677
Since you don't believe me, I'll
use Luna P to prove just who I
am!

163
00:15:21,717 --> 00:15:22,818
Huh?

164
00:15:28,623 --> 00:15:30,759
[All Scream]

00:15:32,894 --> 00:15:36,999
[Moaning]

166
00:15:37,065 --> 00:15:38,700
She's powerful.

167
00:15:39,001 --> 00:15:41,703
Chibi-Usa, what has
happened to you?

168
00:15:42,004 --> 00:15:43,905
I can't forgive you people!

169
00:15:44,539 --> 00:15:48,977
Something's wrong. Her eyes,
somehow someone has brainwashed
her!

170
00:15:49,644 --> 00:15:50,612
Brainwashed?

171
00:15:51,613 --> 00:15:53,582
Her mind is being controlled by
an evil force!

172
00:15:53,648 --> 00:15:55,650
So what should we do?

173
00:15:57,119 --> 00:16:00,622
[Grunts]
[Screams]

174
00:16:01,056 --> 00:16:03,658
Chibi-Usa! Why are
you hurting us?!

175
00:16:03,859 --> 00:16:06,762
I despise all of the people who
ignored me.

176
00:16:07,629 --> 00:16:09,998
In fact, I despise everyone in
this world!

177
00:16:10,098 --> 00:16:13,802
What do you mean people ignored
you? Like who?!

178
00:16:14,002 --> 00:16:15,604
Everyone that I knew!

179
00:16:15,837 --> 00:16:17,606
How can you even say that?!

180
00:16:19,107 --> 00:16:23,311
Chibi-Usa, your dad, your mom,
everyone around you, all of us
loved and cared for you!

181
00:16:24,579 --> 00:16:26,748
Your stupid love was fake!

182
00:16:26,948 --> 00:16:27,916
[Gasp]

[Grunt]

185
00:16:32,143 --> 00:16:34,012
Sailor Moon! You can't keep
running away!

186
00:16:34,112 --> 00:16:36,848
But I can't bring myself to
fight against her!

187
00:16:37,115 --> 00:16:39,150
She's still Chibi-Usa!

188
00:16:40,051 --> 00:16:42,754
[Grunting]

189
00:16:44,055 --> 00:16:45,390

190
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:47,125
Go to hell!

[Gasps]

196
00:17:04,142 --> 00:17:08,880
Even the prettiest of flowers
will wither away when infected
with poisonous energy.

197
00:17:09,013 --> 00:17:13,051
Chibi-Usa, an evil energy is in
possession of you right now!

198
00:17:13,718 --> 00:17:15,853
Don't be a fool, shake it off!

199
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:20,758
So you think all of you can gang
up on me and beat me down?
[Screams]

200
00:17:20,858 --> 00:17:21,859
[Gasps]

201
00:17:24,095 --> 00:17:28,733
Quick! Sailor Moon! You must use
the power of the Silver Crystal
to erase the evil energy that's
possessing Chibi-Usa!

202
00:17:29,834 --> 00:17:30,735
Understood.

203
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:36,908
Chibi-Usa, your mind is infected
with evil energy! So it's time
for you to refresh!

204
00:17:37,408 --> 00:17:41,879
Moon Crystal Power!

205
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:48,419
[Grunting]

206
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,422
Chibi-Usa! You are not thinking
clearly!

207
00:17:51,723 --> 00:17:57,895
You need to remember your
childhood again! Your mother and
father were always kind to you!

208
00:18:04,669 --> 00:18:08,439
Mommy, Daddy, where are you?

209
00:18:08,773 --> 00:18:13,344
How can both of you be so mean?
I don't want to be left here all
alone by you!

210
00:18:13,878 --> 00:18:16,347
[Heavy Breathing]

211
00:18:20,918 --> 00:18:21,986

00:18:29,027 --> 00:18:30,995
[Sigh]

213
00:18:31,796 --> 00:18:33,398
Small Lady.

214
00:18:33,665 --> 00:18:35,266
Happy birthday
sweetheart!

215
00:18:35,366 --> 00:18:36,868
Mommy! Daddy!

216
00:18:36,934 --> 00:18:39,804
[All] Small Lady! Happy
Birthday to you!

217
00:18:39,871 --> 00:18:41,339
You're all here!

218
00:18:43,207 --> 00:18:45,977
We're really sorry that you
had to wait an extra day to
celebrate your birthday with us.

219
00:18:46,311 --> 00:18:50,748
They rushed right back here as
soon as they could, so they
could have this party for you.

220
00:18:50,815 --> 00:18:55,053
Yeah and they decided they
wanted to make it a big
surprise for your special day!

221
00:18:55,153 --> 00:18:56,888
So we kept it a secret.

222
00:18:56,988 --> 00:18:58,956
Sorry that we
couldn't tell you.

223
00:18:59,324 --> 00:19:04,395
[Sigh] Thank you! Mommy, Daddy,
all of you!

224
00:19:05,129 --> 00:19:07,265
[Sigh]

225
00:19:08,399 --> 00:19:11,336
You all were, happy for me.

226
00:19:17,408 --> 00:19:19,377
[Gasp] Chibi-Usa!

227
00:19:19,444 --> 00:19:21,779
It's working, she's
changing back!

228
00:19:26,751 --> 00:19:28,252
She's finally
seeing the truth!

229
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:30,722
She's breaking free from
being brainwashed!

230
00:19:30,822 --> 00:19:32,290
Thank goodness!

231
00:19:32,724 --> 00:19:33,858
Chibi-Usa!

232
00:19:36,327 --> 00:19:39,731
Black Lady, don't allow them to
deceive you!

233
00:19:39,831 --> 00:19:41,265
Huh.

234
00:19:42,734 --> 00:19:45,436
Remember how mean your mother
was, and your cruel heartless
father!

235
00:19:45,837 --> 00:19:46,437
[Gasp]

236
00:19:47,705 --> 00:19:50,842
You were a pitiful rabbit who
was starved for love.

237
00:19:50,908 --> 00:19:56,447
Nothing but a lonely soul who
wanted to be remembered on her
birthday, but who never was.

238
00:19:56,748 --> 00:19:59,450
No Chibi-Usa! Don't listen to
that evil man!

239
00:19:59,951 --> 00:20:05,423
You wanted so badly to believe
you were loved, that you
concocted this foolish illusion.

240
00:20:05,723 --> 00:20:06,991
An illusion?

241
00:20:08,025 --> 00:20:11,429
You mean all of my wonderful
memories weren't even real?

242
00:20:11,729 --> 00:20:14,432
Chibi-Usa, you mustn't
let him trick you!

243
00:20:14,732 --> 00:20:19,437
What you saw wasn't something
you dreamed up! It really did
happen to you!

244
00:20:19,871 --> 00:20:23,374
I don't know, I don't know
anymore.

245
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:33,785
They are lying. No one loves
you! You must harden your heart,
it's time you became more
hateful.

246
00:20:34,051 --> 00:20:36,788
[Screaming]

247
00:20:42,727 --> 00:20:44,395
[Sigh]

248
00:20:44,996 --> 00:20:51,769
No one loves you. It's all lies!
No one will ever love you! No
one!

249
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:57,975
The truth is, none of you
celebrated my birthday with me!
No one loved me after all!

250
00:20:58,409 --> 00:21:02,413
He's right! You all hate me and
I hate all of you as well!

251
00:21:07,852 --> 00:21:09,253
No! Chibi-Usa!

252
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,254
Come back to us!

253
00:21:11,689 --> 00:21:15,293
Wiseman has given me a new name
and a better life as Black Lady.

254
00:21:15,393 --> 00:21:17,228
I'm not Chibi-Usa!

255
00:21:17,428 --> 00:21:19,730
You're wrong, you
are Chibi-Usa!

256
00:21:19,797 --> 00:21:20,998
That's who you are!

257
00:21:21,332 --> 00:21:23,668
You're not from
the Black Moon Clan!

258
00:21:23,734 --> 00:21:25,002
Remember your true self!

259
00:21:25,102 --> 00:21:27,939
Don't allow that evil
energy to posses you!

260
00:21:28,005 --> 00:21:30,274
[Laughing]

261
00:21:32,677 --> 00:21:38,749
Soon the power of the Malefic
Black Crystal will be unleashed
from Planet Nemesis, and fired
toward Earth.

262
00:21:38,816 --> 00:21:41,819
Then this entire world will be
destroyed.

263
00:21:43,855 --> 00:21:50,194
And every one of you heartless
people will be disintegrated.
Along with your soon to be dark
world!

264
00:21:50,261 --> 00:21:53,130
[Laughing]

265
00:21:53,231 --> 00:21:53,798
[Gasps]

266
00:21:53,865 --> 00:21:54,899
Chibi-Usa!

267
00:22:01,439 --> 00:22:06,310
[Whimpering]

268
00:22:09,247 --> 00:22:10,748
Chibi-Usa.

269
00:22:13,251 --> 00:22:16,854
What do we have to do to turn
you back into yourself again?

270
00:24:13,918 --> 00:24:18,723
Sailor Moon, I must go warn my
brother, Demande! He must know
the truth!

271
00:24:18,723 --> 00:24:21,192
No, don't Saphir!
You're too injured!

272
00:24:21,726 --> 00:24:25,730
He needs to know what Wiseman's
really up to, before it's too
late!

273
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:27,198
Saphir, look out!

274
00:24:27,465 --> 00:24:28,666
[Screams]

275
00:24:29,834 --> 00:24:34,505
Next time on Sailor Moon R:
"Saphir Dies: Wiseman's Trap."

276
00:24:34,872 --> 00:24:37,542
The moonlight is a
messenger of love.
