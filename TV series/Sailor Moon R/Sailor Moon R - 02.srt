1
00:01:56,955 --> 00:02:02,722
C'mon! It's just not fair
that I'm the only one who
has to be a Sailor Guardian
again! Hurry up and bring...

2
00:02:02,755 --> 00:02:09,022
...back the others! And exactly
who are Ail and An? Are they
connected to these evil
monsters? Oh, I feel like...

3
00:02:09,055 --> 00:02:10,888
...my brain's gonna
explode!

4
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:12,388
I am Sailor Moon!

5
00:02:12,422 --> 00:02:15,722
In the name of the
moon, I'll punish you!

<i>Sailor Guardians Once</i>
<i>Again."</i>

7
00:02:35,422 --> 00:02:38,022
Hey there, Mamoru?

8
00:02:38,288 --> 00:02:40,755
Whoa! Let go!
What's going on?!

9
00:02:40,788 --> 00:02:44,688
You know perfectly well
what's going on. Don't
act so surprised.

10
00:02:44,722 --> 00:02:48,422
But-But I am surprised.
How is it you even know
my name, Bun-head?

11
00:02:48,455 --> 00:02:52,655
C'mon! There's nothing
endearing about the
name Bun-head.

12
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:56,388
When we're out in public
together, why don't you
just call me Usagi?

13
00:02:56,422 --> 00:02:57,222
[Chuckle]

14
00:02:57,255 --> 00:02:59,322
Your name is Usagi?
Good to know!

15
00:02:59,355 --> 00:03:03,822
What?! I can't believe
it! How could you ever
forget my name, Mamoru?

16
00:03:04,055 --> 00:03:08,888
I get it now. Mamoru
doesn't remember our
former life together,
like I do...

17
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:13,455
Which means...he's
forgotten how much we
loved each other back
then, too!

18
00:03:13,488 --> 00:03:14,955
[Whimpering]

19
00:03:14,988 --> 00:03:18,988
Hey, do you have a
fever or something?
What's the matter
with you?

20
00:03:19,022 --> 00:03:20,155
[Gasp]

21
00:03:20,188 --> 00:03:23,288
Oh! There's that cool
guy. I wonder if he
remembers me?

22
00:03:24,755 --> 00:03:28,388
Hey, Tsukino! Hold onto
that guy! Don't let him
get away, okay?!

23
00:03:28,422 --> 00:03:29,788
Natsumi?

24
00:03:29,822 --> 00:03:32,388
What? Not another
weirdo! Oh, man!

25
00:03:32,422 --> 00:03:35,322
Let go of me! I'm
gonna be late for
work!

26
00:03:35,355 --> 00:03:38,955
You got a job?! What
kind of work do you do?
Where do you have to go?

27
00:03:38,988 --> 00:03:40,455
That's really none
of your business!

28
00:03:40,488 --> 00:03:42,155
Hey, I was just askin'!

29
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:48,022
You're such a klutz!
How could you not hold
on to him? How difficult
could that really be?

30
00:03:48,055 --> 00:03:50,755
Let go of me!
Mamoru's getting
away!

31
00:03:50,788 --> 00:03:54,022
Oh really, his name is
Mamoru? I didn't know
that.

32
00:03:54,055 --> 00:03:57,855
Mamoru! I'm
Natsumi Ginga!

33
00:03:59,222 --> 00:04:03,355
Back off! What do you
think you're doing?!
Mamoru's mine!

34
00:04:03,388 --> 00:04:05,755
I don't think he feels
the same way about you.

35
00:04:05,788 --> 00:04:07,922
Well maybe not at
the moment...

36
00:04:07,955 --> 00:04:11,055
Then that means Mamoru
if fair game for both
of us!

37
00:04:11,088 --> 00:04:17,422
Mamoru...I, Natsumi Ginga,
will pierce your heart and
all your passion receptor
points with arrows of...

38
00:04:17,455 --> 00:04:18,955
...adoring love!

39

[Giggle]

40
00:04:22,122 --> 00:04:24,322
Crazy stalker!

41
00:04:26,422 --> 00:04:32,188
We have no idea if we're
up against a new enemy at
this point, but we do know
something bad is happening.

42
00:04:32,222 --> 00:04:35,722
But Minako and the other
Guardians are finally
leading peaceful lives.

43
00:04:35,755 --> 00:04:38,822
I don't want to spoil all
of that for them by
bringing them back!

44
00:04:39,322 --> 00:04:41,655
Mm. Yeah, I know
what you mean...

45
00:04:43,522 --> 00:04:47,255
But then how should we deal
with this? I'm very worried
about Usagi handling it all
on her own.

46
00:04:47,288 --> 00:04:52,255
It's just awful! Mamoru
doesn't even know who
I am, and without his
memories...

47
00:04:52,288 --> 00:04:55,255
...He refuses to pay
any attention to me!

48
00:04:55,288 --> 00:04:59,122
Usagi! There's no time
to be concerned about
that now!

49
00:04:59,155 --> 00:05:00,422
[Whining]

50

[Groaning]

51
00:05:02,422 --> 00:05:06,022
We really should consider
bringing back the memories
of all the others.

52
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:09,922
What?! You mean you can
restore Mamoru's memories
of me?!

53
00:05:11,722 --> 00:05:14,922
We're only thinking about
restoring the other girls'
memories right now...

54
00:05:14,955 --> 00:05:17,388
...so you'll be able to
fight together as Guardians
again.

55
00:05:17,922 --> 00:05:20,188
Huh?! What are you
talking about?

56
00:05:20,222 --> 00:05:23,455
I'm quite able to protect
the Earth by myself! See?

57
00:05:23,488 --> 00:05:24,955
<i>It'll be fine!</i>

58
00:05:26,188 --> 00:05:29,122
There's really no need
to get any of the others
involved.

59
00:05:29,155 --> 00:05:30,288
Yeah?

60
00:05:31,922 --> 00:05:35,788
Is sounds like you've
matured quite a bit from
your battles with the
Dark Kingdom.

61
00:05:35,822 --> 00:05:38,422
You seem serious about
your responsibilities.

62
00:05:38,455 --> 00:05:43,722
That's right. A couple of
bad guys are no problem.
I can stand on my own
two feet!

63
00:05:48,388 --> 00:05:51,688
Uh...Looks to me
like she's gonna
need everybody.

64
00:05:51,722 --> 00:05:53,022
I agree.

65
00:05:53,055 --> 00:05:54,055
[Sighs]

66
00:06:08,388 --> 00:06:12,088
The Makai Tree, the
very source of our
life...

67
00:06:14,088 --> 00:06:17,922
...is getting very weak.
Its accumulated energy
is running out.

68
00:06:17,955 --> 00:06:22,155
So! That effort was a
waste, and depleted
my resources.

69
00:06:24,755 --> 00:06:27,222
Ail, I'm gonna
need more energy.

70
00:06:27,255 --> 00:06:30,955
An, there isn't
much left. The Makai
Tree is depleted.

71
00:06:30,988 --> 00:06:33,255
What?! Are you
absolutely sure?

72
00:06:33,288 --> 00:06:38,788
Yes. To replenish it,
we'll need to steal
some life energy from
the humans on this planet.

73
00:06:40,422 --> 00:06:43,022
I'd say we'll need
to steal a lot...

74
00:06:43,055 --> 00:06:44,288
[Chuckling]

75
00:06:45,888 --> 00:06:47,588
Go ahead, An...

76
00:06:47,622 --> 00:06:51,855
It's up to you to pick
the right Cardian who is
best suited for this
energy-gathering task.

77
00:06:51,888 --> 00:06:53,055
Okay...

78
00:07:00,755 --> 00:07:03,322
Cardian Minotauron...

79
00:07:17,355 --> 00:07:22,455
We've narrowed the search
for the role of Mikan
Shiratori's younger sister
to these final candidates.

80
00:07:22,488 --> 00:07:26,322
Forget her. The others
are good choices,
especially this one.

81
00:07:26,355 --> 00:07:28,722
<i>I like her, too. Very</i>
<i>natural looking.</i>

82
00:07:28,755 --> 00:07:31,122
<i>Any of those five would</i>
<i>be perfect for this series.</i>

83
00:07:31,155 --> 00:07:33,188
It wasn't easy
to find them.

84
00:07:33,222 --> 00:07:36,888
<i>Well, now that you have,</i>
<i>we need to bring them in</i>
<i>to audition and go from</i>
<i>there.</i>

85
00:07:36,922 --> 00:07:39,888
<i>Let's get started.</i>
<i>Set up the appointments</i>
<i>as soon as possible.</i>

86
00:07:39,922 --> 00:07:41,022
Yes, sir.

87
00:07:41,422 --> 00:07:43,922
What do you think
of these girls?

88
00:07:43,955 --> 00:07:45,688
I think they'll
do nicely.

89
00:07:46,322 --> 00:07:49,022
They'll give us
both a lot of
energy.

90
00:07:50,322 --> 00:07:54,055
Hey! How did you two
get in here?! This
screening room is for
executives only.

91
00:07:54,088 --> 00:07:55,788
Extras casting is down
the hall.

92
00:07:56,188 --> 00:08:00,922
My mistake. I didn't
know that. I apologize.

93
00:08:03,455 --> 00:08:07,755
[Screaming]

94
00:08:08,922 --> 00:08:10,055
[Chuckling]

95
00:08:10,088 --> 00:08:12,822
It would be so easy to
steal energy from these
humans.

96
00:08:12,855 --> 00:08:16,088
But let's wait. There's
no need to stuff ourselves
with a lesser grade.

97
00:08:16,122 --> 00:08:19,822
We'll get a much higher
quality of energy from
those young girls.

98
00:08:20,155 --> 00:08:24,388
I agree, but for now,
these guys can help by
turning over their staff
to us.

99
00:08:24,422 --> 00:08:25,822
[Chuckling]

100
00:08:26,855 --> 00:08:30,188
What?! Are you really
gonna be on TV?!

101
00:08:30,222 --> 00:08:32,988
Shh...Keep your
voice down, Usagi!

102
00:08:33,022 --> 00:08:34,055
Oh...

103
00:08:34,088 --> 00:08:35,888
It might happen.
I don't know.

104
00:08:35,922 --> 00:08:41,255
The talent scout who
spotted me, now wants me
to go to some big audition
down at the TV station.

105
00:08:41,288 --> 00:08:43,688
Mmm... That's cool!

106
00:08:44,055 --> 00:08:45,355
So, Usagi...

107
00:08:45,388 --> 00:08:46,755
What is it?

108
00:08:48,322 --> 00:08:50,988
You know how I seem to
have a knack for getting
involved in strange
situations?

109
00:08:51,022 --> 00:08:54,122
I'm worried this might
be another one of those.

110
00:08:54,155 --> 00:08:57,355
Stop worrying! And
besides, they don't
happen to you all <i>that</i>
often.

111
00:08:57,388 --> 00:08:59,088
I'm sure you're
gonna be just fine!

112
00:08:59,722 --> 00:09:01,122
You really think so?

113
00:09:01,155 --> 00:09:03,722
Of course! I could go
with you if that would
make you feel better.

114
00:09:03,755 --> 00:09:04,855
[Gasp]

115
00:09:04,888 --> 00:09:07,722
You would do that?
You really are my
very best friend!

116
00:09:08,388 --> 00:09:09,955
[Chuckling]

117
00:09:09,988 --> 00:09:14,122
Once I'm there, I bet
I'll be able to wrangle
my way in to get an
audition, too!

118
00:09:14,155 --> 00:09:20,255
That's all it'll take.
I'm a shoo-in for the
role! Next thing you know,
I'm on my way to stardom!

119
00:09:20,288 --> 00:09:23,055
[Laughing]

120
00:09:25,188 --> 00:09:26,955
Oh! Miss Kino!

121
00:09:26,988 --> 00:09:31,988
Well, it looks like the
rumors are true. Class
Five's girl genius is
going to audition for...

122
00:09:32,022 --> 00:09:33,022
...this TV show, as well.

123
00:09:34,855 --> 00:09:38,255
Yes, some person from
the TV station called
and insisted that I
come and try my luck.

124
00:09:38,288 --> 00:09:41,188
But I don't know if I
can take the time away
from my studies.

125
00:09:41,222 --> 00:09:43,755
Well, I'm sure
you'll find a way
to do both.

126
00:09:43,788 --> 00:09:47,355
Excuse me. Are you two,
by any chance, here for
the TV show audition?

127
00:09:47,388 --> 00:09:48,369
Yeah.

128
00:09:48,369 --> 00:09:49,688
We sure are.

129
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:54,055
Well, then, why don't
we all go in together?
I heard that these TV
stations are pretty big...

130
00:09:54,088 --> 00:10:00,755
...and it's easy to get
lost in them. But first,
we should introduce
ourselves. I'm Rei Hino.

131
00:10:00,788 --> 00:10:03,755
Oh, and I'm
Makoto Kino.

132
00:10:03,788 --> 00:10:06,055
I'm Ami Mizuno.

133
00:10:06,088 --> 00:10:08,922
Nice to meet you! My
name is Minako Aino.

134
00:10:08,955 --> 00:10:11,355
Hi there.
Good to meet you!

135
00:10:12,422 --> 00:10:13,422

[Gasp]

139
00:10:19,088 --> 00:10:22,388
Is it possible that the
four of us have met
somewhere before?

140
00:10:22,422 --> 00:10:25,355
No. This is a
first. I think.

141
00:10:25,388 --> 00:10:29,922
But it is sort of
odd. I feel like
we're not strangers.

142
00:10:29,955 --> 00:10:33,855
That's weird. I'm
picking up the exact
same vibe.

143
00:10:35,088 --> 00:10:39,188
<i>Huh?! What do you mean</i>
<i>I can't go in! That's</i>
<i>so not fair!</i>

<i>Usagi...</i>
<i>No...Sailor Moon!</i>

00:19:58,518 --> 00:20:01,051
<i>I remember everything now!</i>

301
00:20:01,085 --> 00:20:04,618
<i>We're guardians...The four</i>
<i>Guardians that protect the</i>
<i>Princess!</i>

302
00:20:05,218 --> 00:20:08,485
That's right! How could we have
<i>just forgotten all this?</i>

303
00:20:09,551 --> 00:20:11,318
Mercury Power!

304
00:20:11,351 --> 00:20:12,785
Mars Power!

305
00:20:13,285 --> 00:20:14,785
Jupiter Power!

306
00:20:15,285 --> 00:20:17,218
Venus Power!

307
00:20:17,618 --> 00:20:19,651
Make...up!

308
00:20:32,151 --> 00:20:36,651
[Laughing]

309
00:20:36,685 --> 00:20:39,285
Bubble...!

310
00:20:43,551 --> 00:20:44,785
Spray!

[Grunt]

312

Supreme...!

Thunder!

00:20:58,351 --> 00:20:59,818
[Screaming]

315
00:20:59,851 --> 00:21:01,751
Fire...!

316
00:21:06,451 --> 00:21:08,351
Crescent...!

317
00:21:08,618 --> 00:21:09,651
Soul...!

318
00:21:10,418 --> 00:21:12,151
Beam!

[Screaming]
Cleansing!

00:21:23,685 --> 00:21:25,285
[Giggling]

321
00:21:26,818 --> 00:21:30,251
Curses! We didn't know there
were five Sailor Guardians!

322
00:21:30,285 --> 00:21:31,485
We'll get you for this!

323
00:21:34,385 --> 00:21:36,185
You're back!

324
00:21:37,918 --> 00:21:41,551
Oh, boy. You really do need
our help. You never could
defeat bad guys by yourself.

325
00:21:41,585 --> 00:21:43,318
That's why we're here!

326
00:21:46,218 --> 00:21:47,985
Guess what?

327
00:21:48,018 --> 00:21:52,151
I heard that Mikan Shiratori
collapsed from total exhaustion,
so the TV drama was cancelled.

328
00:21:52,185 --> 00:21:54,318
Oh no. That's really
too bad.

329
00:21:54,351 --> 00:21:57,451
But it's a relief to only
have to focus on my studies
again.

330
00:21:57,685 --> 00:22:01,551
Yeah, but it sucks that we've
gotta put up with fighting
alongside Usagi again.

331
00:22:01,585 --> 00:22:03,451
I'd much rather do
that TV drama.

332
00:22:03,485 --> 00:22:07,285
Sorry everyone. If Usagi
had been more competent
on her own...

333
00:22:07,318 --> 00:22:09,551
...you could have
continued living peaceful
lives.

334
00:22:09,585 --> 00:22:11,551
Yeah but, it couldn't be
helped.

335
00:22:11,585 --> 00:22:14,551
A new enemy has appeared on the
scene, and we have a mission.

336
00:22:14,585 --> 00:22:17,418
It's our duty to defend
the earth from them, right?

337
00:22:17,451 --> 00:22:18,151
Mhm.

338
00:22:19,451 --> 00:22:20,551
[Laughing]
That's right! But
I'd rather play!

339
00:22:20,751 --> 00:22:23,485
Well, she didn't forget
how to be a dork.

340
00:22:24,151 --> 00:22:28,151
Now, all we have to do
is bring back Mamoru's
memories!

341
00:22:28,185 --> 00:22:31,385
[Giggling]

342
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:12,849
<i>You saved me,</i>
<i>but who are you?</i>

343
00:24:12,882 --> 00:24:15,282
<i>Those gentle eyes...that</i>
<i>heroic face...</i>

344
00:24:15,315 --> 00:24:17,982
She's falling into the
same bad habits again.

345
00:24:18,315 --> 00:24:21,282
<i>Yes, it's all because</i>
<i>I'm so beautiful!</i>

346
00:24:21,315 --> 00:24:23,182
<i>Oh I'm such a</i>
<i>bad girl!</i>

347
00:24:23,215 --> 00:24:26,115
[Sigh]
You're such a silly
girl Usagi.

348
00:24:26,682 --> 00:24:28,815
<i>Next time on 'Sailor Moon R:'</i>

349
00:24:28,849 --> 00:24:32,749
"For Whom Is The White Rose? The
<i>Moonlight Knight Appears."</i>

350
00:24:33,015 --> 00:24:35,882
<i>The moonlight is a</i>
<i>messenger of love.</i>
