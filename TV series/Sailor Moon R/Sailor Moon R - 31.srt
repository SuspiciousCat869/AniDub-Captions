1
00:01:57,164 --> 00:02:03,107
Mamo, look at me. I
braided hope into every
strand of this promise
bracelet. The hope that

2
00:02:03,141 --> 00:02:07,747
we could be together
again. But then you,
droid, came along to
crush that hope and the

3
00:02:07,781 --> 00:02:10,752
hopes of all young girls.
I can't forgive you for
that!

4
00:02:10,786 --> 00:02:15,693
I am Sailor Moon! And
in the name of the moon,
I'll punish you!

5
00:02:19,766 --> 00:02:23,606
[panting]
I'm late for class again!

6
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:28,881
[panting]

7
00:02:28,881 --> 00:02:30,584
Look out!

8
00:02:30,617 --> 00:02:31,552
Hm?

9
00:02:31,585 --> 00:02:33,656
Ahhhh!

10
00:02:33,756 --> 00:02:35,725
My goodness! Are
you all right?

11
00:02:35,792 --> 00:02:38,730
[groaning]
I think you
broke my head.

12
00:02:38,764 --> 00:02:41,434
Oh. Sorry.

13
00:02:41,468 --> 00:02:43,237
So, did they
take roll?

14
00:02:43,237 --> 00:02:47,911
Oh, Miss Haruda isn't
here today. So first
period has been turned
into a study hall.

15
00:02:47,945 --> 00:02:52,819
Oh, I wish I'd had
known that! I could've
slept in and had
second breakfast.

16
00:02:52,886 --> 00:02:55,123
Umino. Give it back.

17
00:02:55,156 --> 00:02:56,725
Huh? Do I
have to?

18
00:02:56,758 --> 00:02:59,830
It's not done. You'll get
it when I'm finished, okay?

19
00:02:59,897 --> 00:03:02,000
Whatever you say, but I
hope you finish soon.

20
00:03:03,035 --> 00:03:04,037
What is that thing?

21
00:03:04,071 --> 00:03:05,639
A promise bracelet.

22
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:06,975
Huh?

23
00:03:07,008 --> 00:03:09,813
It's bracelet for two
people who just can't
wait to get it on!

24
00:03:09,846 --> 00:03:11,549
To get it on?

25
00:03:13,752 --> 00:03:15,822
[grunting]

26
00:03:16,257 --> 00:03:17,659
Sounds painful.

27
00:03:17,659 --> 00:03:18,693
Just forget it.

28
00:03:23,568 --> 00:03:27,641
"Shared Feelings: Usagi
and Mamoru in Love Once
Again."

29
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:33,684
These are what Umino and
I were talking about,and
everyone's making them
now.

30
00:03:33,717 --> 00:03:37,089
Oh! They're really
lovely, but what do you
do with them?

31
00:03:37,156 --> 00:03:41,697
You put your hopes and
wishes into every braid
and fasten it to your
wrist or ankle.

32
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:44,902
It's meant to
symbolize friendship
or everlasting love.

33
00:03:44,936 --> 00:03:47,573
It's becoming quite
popular all over Japan.

34
00:03:47,606 --> 00:03:48,241
Yeah!

35
00:03:48,274 --> 00:03:55,185
[chatting]

36
00:03:55,219 --> 00:04:00,560
You're not kidding! It
looks like everyone's
making them and
wearing them!

37
00:04:00,727 --> 00:04:03,097
I wonder if I can learn
to make one, too?

38
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:06,804
Different kinds of
materials and colors
stand for different
wishes!

39
00:04:06,837 --> 00:04:10,743
Why don't we go to
this new specialty store
that just opened up in the
Juban District?

40
00:04:10,776 --> 00:04:12,646
Cool!

41
00:04:12,679 --> 00:04:16,685
Yeah, I'm pretty sure they
carry everything you're
gonna need to make a
bracelet! Embroidery floss,

42
00:04:16,752 --> 00:04:21,760
leather laces, beads,
patterns, special tape,
instruction books. And
they even have classes

43
00:04:21,793 --> 00:04:23,764
for anyone who buys their
materials there.

44
00:04:23,797 --> 00:04:27,837
And it's said that if you
braid one of these for
your boyfriend and give
it to him, that the two

45
00:04:27,903 --> 00:04:29,573
of you will be together
forever.

46
00:04:29,606 --> 00:04:31,476
That's why Naru's making
one.

47
00:04:31,509 --> 00:04:34,748
Hey! I should
make Mamo one! Uh!

48
00:04:36,017 --> 00:04:38,820
Stop being so damn
affectionate all the
time!

49
00:04:38,854 --> 00:04:42,861
I just don't feel that
way about you anymore. So
please cut it out!

50
00:04:42,927 --> 00:04:44,864
It's over between you and
me!

51
00:04:45,298 --> 00:04:47,802
Go home, now! Go on!

52
00:04:48,269 --> 00:04:49,037
Uh...

53
00:04:51,641 --> 00:04:57,216
But you said... we loved
each other... and we were
going to be together
forever and ever.

54
00:05:00,288 --> 00:05:01,924
Mamo...

55
00:05:12,841 --> 00:05:13,843
[sighing]

56
00:05:13,943 --> 00:05:16,080
Usagi? Usagi!

57
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,115
Huh?

58
00:05:17,182 --> 00:05:18,718
What's the matter? You
look a little sad.

59
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:20,721
Did something happen at
school today?

60
00:05:20,754 --> 00:05:23,625
Oh, no. That's not it.
I'm fine.

61
00:05:23,692 --> 00:05:25,028
You sure don't look your
happy self.

62
00:05:25,061 --> 00:05:28,867
If you have a problem,
you know you can always
count on us to help out.

63
00:05:28,867 --> 00:05:32,639
Thanks a lot, guys. But
it's really nothing that
you should be worrying
about.

64
00:05:32,706 --> 00:05:37,214
I heard that a promise
bracelet shop opened up
in the Juban District!

65
00:05:38,683 --> 00:05:39,751
Mamo!

66
00:05:41,286 --> 00:05:45,193
He's looking at me! My
wish is answered! I may
not need that bracelet.

67
00:05:45,193 --> 00:05:46,728
Hey, wait!

68
00:05:46,762 --> 00:05:47,697
Uh!

69
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:49,700
[whimpering]

70
00:05:53,607 --> 00:05:55,142
M-Mamo...

71
00:05:56,611 --> 00:05:59,649
I've been thinking about
us for quite some time,
now.

72
00:05:59,716 --> 00:06:02,287
I don't understand.
Please tell me...

73
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:07,829
What did I do that was so
awful, to cause you not
to like me anymore?

74
00:06:07,862 --> 00:06:11,334
If I knew what it was, it
would help me get over
the feelings I have for
you.

75
00:06:11,368 --> 00:06:13,638
[sobbing]

76
00:06:13,671 --> 00:06:17,177
Please! Could you just
tell me what it was I
did?

77
00:06:19,714 --> 00:06:22,686
You didn't do anything,
Usako. It's my fault.

78
00:06:23,654 --> 00:06:24,789
Mamo!

79
00:06:27,627 --> 00:06:31,300
No. Don't go.
[crying]

80
00:06:39,713 --> 00:06:42,550
[chuckling]

81
00:06:45,021 --> 00:06:46,791
Prince Demande...

82
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:54,002
...cleansed the beautiful
Crystal Tokyo. The
streets were awash in red
as millions fell...

83
00:06:54,035 --> 00:06:59,845
I shall do my own
cleansing of this filthy
Tokyo... with a wash of
Dark Power everywhere!

84
00:07:00,913 --> 00:07:03,751
Now our new negative
point is...

85
00:07:10,061 --> 00:07:11,129
...right there.

86
00:07:22,881 --> 00:07:23,616
[grunting]

87
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:29,725
Come out, Droid Udering!

88
00:07:36,069 --> 00:07:37,738
Udering!

89
00:07:39,575 --> 00:07:45,016
This Tokyo is cramped and
stifling. You must grow a
Dark Henge, so the Clan
has a gate to pass

90
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:46,252
through to take
it over.

91
00:07:46,252 --> 00:07:47,654
Understood!

92
00:07:50,091 --> 00:07:54,098
I miss him already. I
want to go back to him as
soon as possible.

93
00:07:54,799 --> 00:07:57,804
I long to bury my head in
Prince Demande's arms.

94
00:08:01,142 --> 00:08:03,813
This is that shop where
you get the materials for
braiding.

95
00:08:03,813 --> 00:08:08,387
These bracelets are great
at promoting happiness
because they make your
wishes come true!

96
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:10,156
Oh, nice.

97
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:13,929
And do you know the
best way to make sure these
bracelets are working to
make you happy?

98
00:08:13,996 --> 00:08:15,498
Uh?

99
00:08:15,498 --> 00:08:18,436
From what I understand,
the trick is to absolutely
believe that they're working

100
00:08:18,503 --> 00:08:20,840
and that in itself
will bring you lots
of happiness.

101
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,411
I'm repeating what I read
somewhere.

102
00:08:23,478 --> 00:08:29,020
But don't you think that
being a believer really does
give you the power to make
yourself feel better?

103
00:08:29,053 --> 00:08:31,658
Yeah. Thanks for
cheering me up, Mako.

104
00:08:32,091 --> 00:08:37,667
Okay, here are the items
you need to make a promise
bracelet for mending
broken relationships.

105
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:38,602
Thanks, Ami!

106
00:08:38,669 --> 00:08:40,672
The braiding class is
right down there.

107
00:08:40,672 --> 00:08:41,607
Oh, yeah?

108
00:08:42,775 --> 00:08:44,077
Looks busy.

109
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:46,948
We're going out front to
see if there's anything
else we need.

110
00:08:47,015 --> 00:08:47,949
Have fun,
Usagi.

111
00:08:48,016 --> 00:08:48,851
Okay.

112
00:08:54,193 --> 00:08:55,896
Someone new is joining
us?

113
00:08:55,929 --> 00:08:56,931
Usagi...

114
00:08:56,998 --> 00:08:58,701
You're taking
the class, too?

115
00:08:58,734 --> 00:09:01,171
Hi, Umino. Yeah,
I am!

116
00:09:01,237 --> 00:09:04,176
Since you're friends..
why not sit right here at
their table?

117
00:09:05,077 --> 00:09:08,415
I'm glad you decided to
come. You looked so down
today, I was getting
worried.

118
00:09:08,449 --> 00:09:10,085
First cut the embroidery.

119
00:09:10,085 --> 00:09:14,158
You'll need to measure
out and cut ten
ninety-centimeter lengths
of floss...

120
00:09:14,192 --> 00:09:16,095
Okay.

121
00:09:16,095 --> 00:09:19,834
Once the floss is secured
with the tape, you begin
braiding by using the
middle pieces and forming

122
00:09:19,867 --> 00:09:22,003
a figure four. Repeat
this twice.

123
00:09:22,037 --> 00:09:24,108
If I do that,I'll
lose my place.

124
00:09:28,114 --> 00:09:29,316
[groaning]

125
00:09:29,349 --> 00:09:32,755
Then how about we try
starting with a simpler
pattern instead?

126
00:09:32,788 --> 00:09:34,591
Mmm.

127
00:09:34,624 --> 00:09:38,997
Take six strands and
start braiding them in the
same figure-four shape,
starting from the left.

128
00:09:39,097 --> 00:09:41,268
It's actually quite
simple, once you get
the hang of it.

129
00:09:41,301 --> 00:09:44,172
[groaning]
Oopsie.

130
00:09:44,273 --> 00:09:45,341
Uh...

131
00:09:45,374 --> 00:09:48,780
Every beginner
struggles... just
not as much as you.

132
00:09:48,813 --> 00:09:54,021
Ah, closing time. That's
it for today! Now, I want
all of you to read your
instruction book and

133
00:09:54,054 --> 00:09:56,159
finish your
bracelets at
home.

134
00:09:56,192 --> 00:09:59,363
Awww, I don't wanna
have to read a book.

135
00:09:59,396 --> 00:10:01,367
That means everybody!

136
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,768
Got it!

137
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:03,470
Bye!

138
00:10:03,503 --> 00:10:04,437
Thanks for the lesson.

139
00:10:05,273 --> 00:10:07,709
Everyone be careful. Get
home safe.

140
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:16,290
Ole, ole, ole! Udering!

141
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:20,463
Udering, update me on
your progress.

142
00:10:20,463 --> 00:10:24,002
Those who wear the
bracelets home tonight,
will be contaminated.

143
00:10:24,036 --> 00:10:28,810
The Dark Power that I put
in all of the braiding
materials will quickly
intensify and the Dark

144
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:29,978
Henges will grow.

145
00:10:30,011 --> 00:10:32,249
Excellent. Good
work, Udering.

146
00:10:32,482 --> 00:10:34,152
[chuckling]

147
00:10:38,826 --> 00:10:41,296
I wonder if she finished
her promise bracelet?

148
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:45,303
Oh, she dozed off. Darn,
I was going to ask her
to make me one!

149
00:10:45,337 --> 00:10:50,177
Trying something
new must have tired her
out. Why don't we let her
rest for awhile?

150
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:51,846
Yeah. Good idea.

151
00:10:52,046 --> 00:10:55,185
Uh... why, Mamo?
I don't get it.

152
00:11:08,273 --> 00:11:14,549
Mamo... We're finally
able to marry, at long
last.

153
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:17,888
Usako, I'll never let
you go again.

154
00:11:19,257 --> 00:11:20,292
Mamo...

155
00:11:21,928 --> 00:11:23,096
Usako...

156
00:11:25,233 --> 00:11:27,269
I'm so happy...

157
00:11:32,577 --> 00:11:33,613
[screaming]

158
00:11:33,646 --> 00:11:36,985
Mamoru Chiba, you must
stay away from Usagi
Tsukino.

159
00:11:37,018 --> 00:11:39,121
Who said that?

160
00:11:39,155 --> 00:11:43,996
The moment that the two
of you are wed, the world
will come to an end and
tragedy will befall Usagi

161
00:11:44,063 --> 00:11:46,801
Tsukino, Princess
Serenity...!

162
00:11:46,934 --> 00:11:48,503
No! That's a lie!

163
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:50,907
A lie!

164
00:11:52,076 --> 00:11:53,244
[gasping]

165
00:11:54,579 --> 00:11:56,182
A lie?

166
00:11:56,248 --> 00:11:58,151
Why did I dream that?

167
00:12:03,928 --> 00:12:05,530
M- Mamo...

168
00:12:08,267 --> 00:12:09,336
[gasping]

169
00:12:17,149 --> 00:12:18,250
Sailor Moon...

170
00:12:18,317 --> 00:12:19,986
...'R'!

171
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:35,177
Sailor Moon! R!

172
00:12:37,248 --> 00:12:39,918
Mamo! It's me!
Open the door!

173
00:12:39,951 --> 00:12:42,221
Be quiet! Do you realize
what time it is?

174
00:12:42,255 --> 00:12:43,690
I'm sorry!

175
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:46,929
But I need you to listen
to me. There's something
that I have to ask you!

176
00:12:46,962 --> 00:12:50,268
I'm not listening, and
I'm not answering any
questions! Now go!

177
00:12:50,334 --> 00:12:53,873
Wait, Mamo! Did you
have a strange dream
about us getting married?

178
00:12:53,907 --> 00:12:55,176
How did you know that?

179
00:12:56,611 --> 00:13:00,350
I wonder why Usagi
suddenly went out to
see Mamoru at this time
of night.

180
00:13:01,019 --> 00:13:03,589
She shouldn't see him
'til she's done with
his bracelet.

181
00:13:03,622 --> 00:13:07,495
From what you're
saying, it sounds like we
had the same dream.

182
00:13:07,528 --> 00:13:09,164
That's just what I
thought...

183
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,938
But maybe the dream has
no meaning, other than
just being a dream.

184
00:13:12,938 --> 00:13:15,942
But what if you're wrong?
You could die, Usako!

185
00:13:15,942 --> 00:13:19,949
Wait a sec. You broke
up with me for what
you think is my own good.

186
00:13:19,949 --> 00:13:22,152
I'm not believing that
dream, and you shouldn't,
either.

187
00:13:22,185 --> 00:13:27,427
Well, at first I didn't
believe it, but then, I
kept having the same
vision every night.

188
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:32,435
Which makes me think this
isn't any ordinary dream
and that its purpose is
to show us the future.

189
00:13:32,435 --> 00:13:35,974
But even if the dream's
true... as long as we're
together...

190
00:13:36,007 --> 00:13:38,043
I would be okay
dying, Mamo.

191
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:38,879
Uh!

192
00:13:40,381 --> 00:13:43,953
Usako... I
think...

193
00:13:43,987 --> 00:13:46,524
No, wait!
...we shouldn't be
together at all! Just go!

194
00:13:48,895 --> 00:13:52,901
Mamo, don't push me
away! No matter what
happens, I wanna be
with you!

195
00:13:53,001 --> 00:13:56,106
Even if the world is
destroyed, I want to be
with you, Mamo!

196
00:13:56,106 --> 00:13:58,543
Even if I die, I want to
be with you!

197
00:13:58,609 --> 00:14:02,216
Don't you get it! I want
us to be together forever!

198
00:14:02,249 --> 00:14:03,350
I know, but we can't.

199
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:05,253
Mamo, please!

200
00:14:05,353 --> 00:14:09,627
[sobbing]
Mamo!

201
00:14:09,694 --> 00:14:11,630
Usagi's sure taking a
long time.

202
00:14:11,697 --> 00:14:12,566
Uh-huh.

203
00:14:15,036 --> 00:14:17,640
Ah! Here she comes now.

204
00:14:17,707 --> 00:14:18,908
Usagi!

205
00:14:19,043 --> 00:14:20,211
[gasping]

206
00:14:20,277 --> 00:14:21,213
Chibi-Usa!

207
00:14:21,213 --> 00:14:23,583
It won't let go! I can't
get it off of me!

208
00:14:23,616 --> 00:14:30,962
[screaming]

209
00:14:31,028 --> 00:14:32,430
[gasping]
What is it?!

210
00:14:32,463 --> 00:14:32,931
[screaming]

211
00:14:32,965 --> 00:14:34,867
Just hold still!

212
00:14:39,241 --> 00:14:41,245
Chibi-Usa, are
you all right?

213
00:14:41,278 --> 00:14:41,979
I think so.

214
00:14:42,045 --> 00:14:43,915
Luna, what just happened
here?

215
00:14:43,948 --> 00:14:46,453
Your promise bracelet
attacked her!

216
00:14:46,486 --> 00:14:48,422
But... why
would it?

217
00:14:49,323 --> 00:14:50,492
Wait a minute...

218
00:14:50,892 --> 00:14:52,161
That store...

219
00:14:53,297 --> 00:14:54,899
What's the matter?

220
00:14:54,933 --> 00:14:57,003
We gotta get to
the store. Let's go!

221
00:14:57,103 --> 00:14:57,937
We're coming!!

222
00:14:58,071 --> 00:15:03,613
[panicking]

223
00:15:03,613 --> 00:15:05,116
I can't get it off!

224
00:15:06,117 --> 00:15:06,618
[gasping]

225
00:15:06,618 --> 00:15:08,955
[screaming]

226
00:15:08,955 --> 00:15:10,124
Umino!

227
00:15:10,691 --> 00:15:12,694
Everyone! We have a
situation!

228
00:15:12,727 --> 00:15:13,963
What's going on?

229
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:17,135
It involves the new
promise bracelet shop
that just opened up.

230
00:15:17,135 --> 00:15:20,507
We'll head there right
now! Let's go, Artemis.
C'mon!

231
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:21,541
All right!

232
00:15:23,578 --> 00:15:24,513
Look, Usagi!

233
00:15:24,546 --> 00:15:27,217
Just as I thought. This
place is the source!

234
00:15:28,352 --> 00:15:32,859
Moon Crystal
Power! Make up!

235
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:18,599
Ahhh! Dark Power Intensify!

236
00:16:21,103 --> 00:16:23,473
Hey, you! Stop what
you're doing!!

237
00:16:23,507 --> 00:16:25,243
Oh yeah, who are you?!

238
00:16:26,979 --> 00:16:28,982
Girls put their wishes
into those braids and
were waiting for them
to come true!

239
00:16:29,015 --> 00:16:30,951
You put evil power in
them...

240
00:16:30,985 --> 00:16:34,524
...so their wishes
were denied. That's
unforgivable!

241
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:37,662
I'm the Pretty Guardian
who fights for love and
for justice.

242
00:16:37,695 --> 00:16:39,331
I am Sailor Moon!

243
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:44,173
And now, in the name
of the moon, I'll
punish you!

244
00:16:44,573 --> 00:16:46,409
You mouthy little twit!

245
00:16:46,443 --> 00:16:49,347
Here's what we do to
those who get in the way
of our plans!

246
00:16:49,414 --> 00:16:50,616
I'm going to ring you!

247
00:16:51,017 --> 00:16:52,419
One ring!

248
00:16:53,086 --> 00:16:56,091
A diagonal pattern to
make my wish come true!

249
00:16:57,093 --> 00:16:58,930
[chuckling]

250
00:16:58,963 --> 00:17:04,271
Refusing to give up after
one try is my secret to
my success. I just have
to change my pattern.

251
00:17:04,338 --> 00:17:06,274
Two rings!

252
00:17:06,374 --> 00:17:10,180
Normally I'd use a heart
pattern, but since you
have no boyfriend,
why bother?!

253
00:17:10,214 --> 00:17:13,687
How dare you! I may look
single, but I have a
boyfriend!

254
00:17:13,687 --> 00:17:15,255
Look out, Sailor Moon!

255
00:17:15,288 --> 00:17:16,157
Get back!

256
00:17:16,157 --> 00:17:17,326
Ahhhh!

257
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:19,729
[groaning]

258
00:17:20,498 --> 00:17:22,501
That was only the
warm-up. More to come!

259
00:17:22,534 --> 00:17:23,502
[growling]

260
00:17:25,004 --> 00:17:30,680
Ringa, ringa, ringa,
ringa, ringa, ringa,
ringa, ringa, ringa,
ring! [gasping]

261
00:17:31,581 --> 00:17:33,251
Who's the wise guy?

262
00:17:39,728 --> 00:17:45,036
Promise bracelets are
strands of hope. Young
girls put their faith in
them, but you, with your

263
00:17:45,069 --> 00:17:48,208
ugly heart, shatter their
faith.

264
00:17:48,241 --> 00:17:52,014
I, Tuxedo Mask...
won't forgive you!

265
00:17:52,381 --> 00:17:54,685
[chuckling]

266
00:17:55,219 --> 00:17:58,224
Don't make me laugh.
Faith is meaningless...

267
00:17:58,357 --> 00:18:00,060
So... wake up.

268
00:18:00,227 --> 00:18:02,196
Three Ring Thunder!

269
00:18:03,265 --> 00:18:04,868
[grunting]

270
00:18:04,935 --> 00:18:09,174
You're pretty agile for a
guy in a tux! Let's see
how you do with my zigzag
design!

271
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:10,766
Uh!

272
00:18:14,572 --> 00:18:18,646
Shine Aqua Illusion!

273
00:18:22,485 --> 00:18:23,587
Sailor Mercury!

274
00:18:24,455 --> 00:18:26,224
I got here just in time!

275
00:18:26,257 --> 00:18:28,762
Just for you!
Four Ring Drive!

276
00:18:29,229 --> 00:18:34,504
This design gets a lot of
traction! And pretty
soon, without it, you're
gonna spin out!

277
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:39,245
Burning....

278
00:18:40,447 --> 00:18:43,753
...Mandala!

279
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,289
Sorry I'm late.

280
00:18:46,456 --> 00:18:47,859
Boy, we're glad
to see you!

281
00:18:47,925 --> 00:18:51,131
I've got one
design left!

282
00:18:51,164 --> 00:18:54,469
Five Ring... Spin out!

283
00:18:54,669 --> 00:18:58,509
Sparkling Wide Pressure!

284
00:18:58,575 --> 00:19:01,180
Venus Love Me Chain!

285
00:19:06,255 --> 00:19:07,724
Better late than never!

286
00:19:07,757 --> 00:19:09,860
I'm all out of rings!
[panicking]

287
00:19:09,894 --> 00:19:12,197
You know what to do,
Sailor Moon!

288
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:13,199
You bet!

289
00:19:32,196 --> 00:19:38,673
Moon Princess Halation!

290
00:19:42,278 --> 00:19:44,850
Ri-i-i-i-i-i-ng!

291
00:19:49,223 --> 00:19:50,258
[groaning]

292
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:51,894
Huh?

293
00:19:51,927 --> 00:19:52,695
Umino!

294
00:19:52,728 --> 00:19:53,530
Naru!

295
00:19:59,472 --> 00:20:02,310
[laughing]

296
00:20:02,377 --> 00:20:03,178
We know that laugh.

297
00:20:03,211 --> 00:20:04,547
It's Esmeraude.

298
00:20:05,849 --> 00:20:08,888
I guess you Guardians are
feeling pretty cocky! But
listen...

299
00:20:08,921 --> 00:20:14,763
It'll be only a matter of
time before a Dark Gate
opens in Tokyo. And then,
the power of the Malefic

300
00:20:14,796 --> 00:20:20,406
Black Crystal will come
gushing in, changing your
Silver Crystal into a
Malefic Black...

301
00:20:20,439 --> 00:20:24,379
...that will envelop and
destroy the entire world
with Dark Power.

302
00:20:24,412 --> 00:20:31,290
[laughing]

303
00:20:33,961 --> 00:20:35,296
Sailor Moon...

304
00:20:35,597 --> 00:20:37,300
Uh! What is it?

305
00:20:39,069 --> 00:20:42,374
As you know, we have been
entrusted with the
mission of protecting our
beloved city and the

306
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:44,644
future city of Crystal
Tokyo.

307
00:20:45,378 --> 00:20:49,786
No matter what hardships
we may encounter, we must
endure them and move
forward.

308
00:20:50,753 --> 00:20:52,791
I understand what
you're saying.

309
00:20:54,827 --> 00:20:59,835
Sailor Guardians... Let's
continue to fight
together!

310
00:21:02,639 --> 00:21:03,741
Farewell!

311
00:21:06,044 --> 00:21:08,649
So we can only be
together when we fight.

312
00:21:08,649 --> 00:21:11,387
Sailor Moon, you can't
just let him walk away.

313
00:21:11,454 --> 00:21:12,321
Huh?

314
00:21:12,355 --> 00:21:14,124
Put on your running shoes
and go after him!

315
00:21:14,157 --> 00:21:18,999
I don't know what
happened previously, but
there is no misunderstanding
between you two, now.

316
00:21:19,032 --> 00:21:21,002
How can you be so
certain?

317
00:21:21,035 --> 00:21:23,806
We can see the love
shining in your eyes.

318
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,642
It's really a
no-brainer.

319
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:29,515
Live the moment. Put away
all your worries for the
future.

320
00:21:29,548 --> 00:21:30,751
Go get him!

321
00:21:31,686 --> 00:21:33,522
Okay. Thank you,
everybody.

322
00:21:34,356 --> 00:21:36,761
You can do this,
Usagi! Just go for it!

323
00:21:36,994 --> 00:21:38,997
I hope your wish
comes true!

324
00:21:38,997 --> 00:21:40,500
Good luck, Usagi.

325
00:21:48,245 --> 00:21:48,980
Mamo!

326
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:50,315
Usako?

327
00:21:52,218 --> 00:21:57,894
Perhaps in the future, we
won't be together. But
for now, it suddenly feels
all right. And I know in

328
00:21:57,927 --> 00:22:03,069
my heart that Mamo, at
this very moment, feels
the same way.

329
00:22:03,436 --> 00:22:04,071
Mamo!

330
00:22:04,071 --> 00:22:04,905
Usako.

331
00:22:07,843 --> 00:22:08,844
Ah!

332
00:22:11,449 --> 00:22:12,751
Mamo...

333
00:22:15,923 --> 00:22:17,459
Usako...

334
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:16,114
A wave of influenza is
sweeping through the
Juban District. One after
another, the Sailor

335
00:24:16,147 --> 00:24:18,484
Guardians are falling
victim. Achoo!

336
00:24:18,517 --> 00:24:20,287
Just leave the
healing to me!

337
00:24:20,287 --> 00:24:24,387
I, Sailor Venus,
goddess of love, will
lovingly nurse everyone
back to health!

338
00:24:24,387 --> 00:24:26,255
Thanks, Minako.

339
00:24:26,322 --> 00:24:30,059
Hey, flu bug that's
making everybody sick...
In the name of the Moon,
I'll punish you!

340
00:24:30,092 --> 00:24:34,664
Next time on
Sailor Moon R:
"Venus: Minako's
Nurse Mayhem".

341
00:24:34,697 --> 00:24:36,966
The moonlight is a
messenger of love.
