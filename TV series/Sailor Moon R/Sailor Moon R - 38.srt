1
00:01:57,872 --> 00:01:59,311
Chibi-Usa where are you?

2
00:01:59,311 --> 00:02:04,249
Why did you leave the Crystal
Palace? Running away from your
problems won't solve anything!

3
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:08,820
Come back here immediately! If
Wiseman ever finds out about
your secret he'll...No, I won't
let that happen!

4
00:02:11,472 --> 00:02:15,576
I am Sailor Moon! In the name of
the Moon, I'll find you!

5
00:02:26,821 --> 00:02:30,491
Saphir, set the Malefic Black
Crystal Reactor to full power.

6
00:02:30,558 --> 00:02:33,394
Direct all its energy towards
the barrier at the Crystal
Palace.

7
00:02:33,594 --> 00:02:37,465
Once the barrier has been
eliminated, I will go get the
Queen myself.

8
00:02:37,531 --> 00:02:38,599
No you mustn't!

9
00:02:39,433 --> 00:02:41,469
Brother, get over it.

10
00:02:41,535 --> 00:02:45,406
She rejected you in the past as
Sailor Moon, and now as Neo
Queen Serenity.

11
00:02:46,474 --> 00:02:47,541
Enough!

12
00:02:49,643 --> 00:02:53,481
I fear you have lost sight of
the ultimate objective of our
Black Moon Clan, all because of
your obsession with her.

13
00:02:54,615 --> 00:03:00,321
Our ancestors resented having to
leave the fine planet of Earth,
and being forced to live here
on Nemesis.

14
00:03:00,521 --> 00:03:05,659
And I for one have not forgotten
our plan to rewrite Earth's
history so that we may reap
our revenge!

15
00:03:06,627 --> 00:03:07,394
Hmph!

16
00:03:07,461 --> 00:03:08,429
[Screams]

17
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:10,464
Sir, what are you doing?!

18
00:03:10,531 --> 00:03:13,434
Instead of wasting so much time
lecturing me...

19
00:03:13,534 --> 00:03:17,404
...why don't you make yourself
useful and start working on
powering up the reactor.

20
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:20,441
[Grunting] As you command, sir.

21
00:03:23,377 --> 00:03:25,279
Neo Queen Serenity...

22
00:03:26,514 --> 00:03:28,516
One day, you'll be mine.

23
00:03:28,716 --> 00:03:30,718
[Grunting]

24
00:03:36,323 --> 00:03:40,694
"Wiseman's Evil Hand: Chibi-Usa
Disappears."

25
00:03:47,535 --> 00:03:50,704
So this is the Crystal Palace.

26
00:03:51,438 --> 00:03:53,707
It's so quite it feels
like a ghost palace.

27
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:59,380
It's hard to believe that people
actually lived here once, and
that the Black Moon Clan killed
all of them.

28
00:03:59,513 --> 00:04:02,750
If this place had been protected
by the Legendary Silver
Crystal...

29
00:04:02,817 --> 00:04:06,687
...there wouldn't have been such
extensive loss of life and this
much destruction.

30
00:04:06,787 --> 00:04:10,724
So what happened to that Silver
Crystal? Why wasn't it secured
safely in the palace?

31
00:04:14,695 --> 00:04:17,298
Are you okay, Chibi-Usa?

32
00:04:17,398 --> 00:04:18,098
[Gasp]

33
00:04:18,165 --> 00:04:19,300
[Sigh]

34
00:04:20,801 --> 00:04:23,671
It's been a while since Tuxedo
Mask went to find Sailor Moon.
Hope they're okay.

35
00:04:24,405 --> 00:04:25,673
I'm gonna go look for them!

36
00:04:26,373 --> 00:04:26,815
Wait.

37
00:04:26,882 --> 00:04:27,549
Huh?

38
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,485
King Endymion!

39
00:04:33,655 --> 00:04:35,323
That will not be necessary.

40
00:04:35,423 --> 00:04:36,424
Observe.

41
00:04:38,593 --> 00:04:40,428
[All] Sailor Moon!

42
00:04:44,633 --> 00:04:46,768
Sailor Moon! You're okay!

43
00:04:46,868 --> 00:04:49,537
[All Giggling]
Hey, girls!

44
00:04:50,305 --> 00:04:55,543
Glad to see you! Jupiter! Venus!
Mercury! Mars! [Crying]

45
00:04:55,777 --> 00:04:59,748
Now stop crying. Pull it
together, we're not out of the
woods yet, you know.

46
00:04:59,881 --> 00:05:02,350
Why are you so angry at me?

47
00:05:02,417 --> 00:05:04,819
[Giggling] Here we go again!

48
00:05:05,086 --> 00:05:08,423
I'm not mad at you, Usagi, I'm
just trying to cheer you up.

49
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:09,824
That's not how it sounded!

50
00:05:25,307 --> 00:05:26,708
[Gasp] Is that?

51
00:05:26,808 --> 00:05:32,814
She is the monarch of Crystal
Tokyo, Neo Queen Serenity. And
she is also my wife.

52
00:05:33,581 --> 00:05:35,283
Mommy!

53
00:05:36,751 --> 00:05:40,288
I brought Sailor Moon and the
other Sailor Guardians from the
past to help.

54
00:05:40,555 --> 00:05:43,325
Mommy, please open your eyes.

55
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,563
King Endymion, what's causing
her to remain in this state?

56
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:51,333
I hate to ask, but will she ever
wake up?

57
00:05:51,466 --> 00:05:52,567
I don't know.

58
00:05:54,769 --> 00:05:58,306
But if the Legendary Silver
Crystal hadn't been lost, we
would still have hope that
perhaps she could be revived.

59
00:05:58,473 --> 00:05:59,474
[Gasps]

60
00:06:00,742 --> 00:06:03,211
But how could something as
powerful as that be lost?

61
00:06:05,213 --> 00:06:09,351
I wish I knew. The only possible
explanation I can think of is
somehow it was removed from the
palace...

62
00:06:09,417 --> 00:06:12,620
...just before the Black Moon
Clan's all out attack began.

63
00:06:13,388 --> 00:06:16,658
Sailor Moon, why don't we see if
your Silver Crystal will work.

64
00:06:17,559 --> 00:06:22,664
But she's been like this for
such a long time. Does my
Crystal really have enough
power to wake her up?

65
00:06:22,731 --> 00:06:24,199
You have to try!

66
00:06:24,299 --> 00:06:25,500
Yeah, give it a shot!

67
00:06:26,234 --> 00:06:28,503
Have faith in yourself,
Sailor Moon.

68
00:06:29,371 --> 00:06:30,372
All right.

69
00:06:31,706 --> 00:06:36,177
Moon Crystal Power!

70
00:06:46,187 --> 00:06:47,322
[Sighing]

71
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,168
[Grunting]

72
00:07:00,268 --> 00:07:01,469
[Sighs]

73
00:07:01,569 --> 00:07:02,837
It looks like nothing's
happening.

74
00:07:03,471 --> 00:07:08,209
It's no use. Even Sailor Moon
isn't strong enough to save
Mommy.

75
00:07:08,676 --> 00:07:10,311
[Crying]

76
00:07:10,378 --> 00:07:11,579
[Gasps]

77
00:07:12,514 --> 00:07:13,615
Chibi-Usa!

78
00:07:15,316 --> 00:07:18,186
Let's leave her alone for now.
She'll be safe as long as she
remains inside the palace.

79
00:07:26,561 --> 00:07:30,098
[Crying]

80
00:07:30,165 --> 00:07:31,633
Mommy.

81
00:07:44,646 --> 00:07:48,149
Mommy, what should I do now?

82
00:07:48,216 --> 00:07:49,417
[Laughing]

83
00:07:49,517 --> 00:07:51,453
[Gasp] Who is that?

84
00:07:52,253 --> 00:07:57,459
I foresee our stars are aligned
with one another at this very
moment.

85
00:07:57,559 --> 00:08:02,230
Thus fate has brought me the
Rabbit's capture.

86
00:08:02,297 --> 00:08:04,165
[Gasps] I can't move!

87
00:08:04,265 --> 00:08:10,572
[Laughing] It's useless. You are
now inside my domain.

88
00:08:12,207 --> 00:08:15,310
I see fear preying on you.

89
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:23,351
Memories of the Legendary Silver
Crystal remain hidden in the far
corners of your mind, under a
clouded veil of sadness.

90
00:08:24,185 --> 00:08:26,154
No! No!

91
00:08:29,591 --> 00:08:34,262
Mommy is so elegant. A wonderful
queen loved by all!

92
00:08:35,096 --> 00:08:37,565
Small Lady, you've been very
naughty again!

93
00:08:37,699 --> 00:08:40,502
You won't become an elegant
lady acting like that!

94
00:08:40,568 --> 00:08:43,271
I will too! Just watch me!

95
00:08:43,338 --> 00:08:44,272
Small Lady!

96
00:08:45,707 --> 00:08:49,444
I want to become a lady soon. A
real lady, and elegant, just
like Mommy!

97
00:08:57,619 --> 00:09:00,355
I'm only going to borrow it.

98
00:09:00,421 --> 00:09:02,624
For a little while. That's all.

99
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:08,263
If I hold the Legendary Silver
Crystal for a moment, I can
become as wonderful as her!

100
00:09:08,563 --> 00:09:10,298
[Sighs]

101
00:09:11,699 --> 00:09:15,637
[Screams]

102
00:09:15,703 --> 00:09:19,541
What's happening?
Where did it go?

103
00:09:26,447 --> 00:09:27,815
Small Lady!

104
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:30,118
Mommy!

105
00:09:35,423 --> 00:09:36,424
Daddy!

106
00:09:36,524 --> 00:09:37,392
[Grunts]

107
00:09:38,626 --> 00:09:42,197
No!

108
00:09:42,463 --> 00:09:45,166
Mommy! Daddy!

109
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,304
So, the Legendary Silver Crystal
vanished.

110
00:09:49,404 --> 00:09:55,210
And because you were traumatized
by what you had done, you hid
that memory deep in your mind.

111
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:59,180
You're wrong! I didn't do
anything! It's not my fault!

112
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:02,517
I wonder what your Sailor
Guardian friends would say?

113
00:10:02,584 --> 00:10:04,285
Huh?

114
00:10:06,187 --> 00:10:08,356
It's all your fault, Small Lady.

115
00:10:08,423 --> 00:10:11,292
This happened because you lost
the Silver Crystal.

116
00:10:11,359 --> 00:10:14,862
Neo Queen Serenity left the
safety of the Crystal Palace to
search for you!

117
00:10:15,163 --> 00:10:17,365
And now she's in a
coma because of you.

118
00:10:17,432 --> 00:10:18,800
You're the one to blame!

119
00:10:18,866 --> 00:10:20,401
No! No!

120
00:10:20,468 --> 00:10:23,338
[All] You're the one to blame!
It's all your fault!

121
00:10:23,571 --> 00:10:27,308
I didn't do anything wrong! I
didn't make it disappear!

122
00:10:27,408 --> 00:10:30,378
All I did was touch the Silver
Crystal! It's not my fault!

123
00:10:30,445 --> 00:10:32,213
[All] It is your fault!

124
00:10:33,214 --> 00:10:34,382
Small Lady.

125
00:10:36,818 --> 00:10:40,588
Stop it! Stop it! I
didn't do anything!

126
00:10:40,688 --> 00:10:44,425
That's true, Rabbit. Don't let
those so-called friends blame
you.

127
00:10:44,492 --> 00:10:48,496
It's not your fault. Use your
power to prove to them that you
are right.

128
00:10:48,563 --> 00:10:52,500
You really think I can do that?
But what if no one believes me?

129
00:10:53,201 --> 00:10:58,606
You will make them understand.
Now, come and take my hand.

130
00:11:13,421 --> 00:11:18,860
My, I have never seen the
Malefic Black Crystal Reactor
brimming with so much energy.

131
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,429
It's like a ticking time bomb,
waiting to explode.

132
00:11:21,829 --> 00:11:22,797
Huh?

133
00:11:24,699 --> 00:11:27,735
My brother doesn't realize how
dangerous the full power of the
Malefic Black Crystal can be.

134
00:11:27,869 --> 00:11:31,873
He blindly does whatever that
dubious sorcerer, Wiseman,
wants.

135
00:11:32,173 --> 00:11:35,510
I fear we may be taking the
wrong path by using this
reactor.

136
00:11:35,576 --> 00:11:40,848
[Laughing] Oh please! What makes
you think any of us trust
Wiseman?

137
00:11:41,115 --> 00:11:44,452
I'm sure Prince Demande is fully
aware of the man's tricky
nature.

138
00:11:45,119 --> 00:11:47,722
Saphir. Is the reactor ready?

139
00:11:49,157 --> 00:11:54,262
[Inhales] Prince Demande,
there's no need to waste the
Malefic Black Crystal on this
mission.

140
00:11:54,329 --> 00:11:56,497
Allow me to handle it
for you instead.

141
00:11:56,564 --> 00:11:59,167
[Gasp] Prince Demande!

142
00:11:59,233 --> 00:12:01,836
My brother has clearly
become too emotional.

143
00:12:02,437 --> 00:12:07,442
If he hadn't fallen in love with
Neo Queen Serenity, this new
mission wouldn't be necessary...

144
00:12:07,508 --> 00:12:10,178
...and we would already have
killed Sailor Moon by now.

145
00:12:10,244 --> 00:12:11,312
Enough of this!

146
00:12:13,147 --> 00:12:17,518
That damn queen is always in
my way! I'll do Wiseman's
bidding as long as I get rid
of her!

147
00:12:18,419 --> 00:12:21,556
I'm not sure what Wiseman's
after, but when all is said and
done...

148
00:12:21,622 --> 00:12:26,127
...I'll be the one using him to
grant Prince Demande's wish for
a new future.

149
00:12:26,728 --> 00:12:35,169
However, Neo Queen Serenity
won't be the one who builds the
future with Prince Demande! It
will be me! [Laughing]

150
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,478
Sailor Moon R!

151
00:12:56,678 --> 00:12:59,514
Sailor Moon R!

152
00:13:15,631 --> 00:13:19,001
Wiseman! Where are you? Show
yourself!

153
00:13:20,669 --> 00:13:24,039
[Giggling]

154
00:13:24,306 --> 00:13:27,509
Who is that? There shouldn't be
any droids left at this base.

155
00:13:27,609 --> 00:13:29,378
Show yourself!

156
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:31,847
Wiseman.

157
00:13:33,448 --> 00:13:36,418
In the words of the ancients,
anger emerges from within to
give power.

158
00:13:36,518 --> 00:13:41,523
But it is a double-edged sword,
it confuses the mind and the
ears at the same time.

159
00:13:41,923 --> 00:13:45,527
Are you trying to tell me that
I'm hearing things? Whatever.

160
00:13:45,627 --> 00:13:47,863
Wiseman I want to make
a deal with you.

161
00:13:47,929 --> 00:13:51,867
I will attack the Crystal Palace
myself and destroy it, once and
for all.

162
00:13:51,933 --> 00:13:55,537
But to do that I will need
strength unlike any seen before.

163
00:13:56,405 --> 00:13:59,441
I'm sure you are capable of
giving me plenty of power.

164
00:13:59,641 --> 00:14:02,077
You're doing this on the
Prince's orders?

165
00:14:04,513 --> 00:14:08,917
Mm, no. But if the outcome of
this battle is to your liking,
then it's a pretty good deal for
you, wouldn't you say?

166
00:14:09,384 --> 00:14:14,389
I foresee another queen reigning
over the future with Prince
Demande.

167
00:14:14,456 --> 00:14:18,927
And that queen is, Queen
Esmeraude.

168
00:14:19,361 --> 00:14:20,395
Queen?!

169
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:28,403
Right now, Neo Queen Serenity
possesses more power than you
because of her position.

170
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:35,877
But if you take in the
full energy of the Malefic Black
Crystal, you can become a queen
with even greater power.

171
00:14:35,944 --> 00:14:38,313
Me, become a queen?

172
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:53,595
Don't assume I'm buying into
this idea of yours, but I'll do
whatever it takes to win Prince
Demand's heart.

173
00:14:54,429 --> 00:14:57,365
Even if I have to make a deal
with the Devil.

174
00:14:58,533 --> 00:14:59,901
[Gasps]

175
00:15:01,436 --> 00:15:03,872
[Screaming]

176
00:15:08,343 --> 00:15:11,980
[Laughing]

177
00:15:12,047 --> 00:15:14,483
My body's overflowing with
power!

178
00:15:14,549 --> 00:15:20,388
I am the true future Queen.
Prince Demande will be mine, and
we shall rule the world
together!

179
00:15:20,455 --> 00:15:21,890
[Laughing]

180
00:15:21,957 --> 00:15:23,859
I wouldn't be so sure.

181
00:15:24,359 --> 00:15:24,960
What?

182
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:26,828
What is this?

183
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:32,801
Did you really think a woman
like you could control the
Malefic Black Crystal's true
power?

184
00:15:33,068 --> 00:15:36,838
Now, surrender your body and
soul to do my bidding!

185
00:15:36,938 --> 00:15:40,509
Damn you, Wiseman. [Grunting]

186
00:15:40,942 --> 00:15:41,910
[Grunts]

187
00:15:43,512 --> 00:15:48,383
Prince Demande, I wish you were
here right now so I could die in
your arms.

188
00:15:50,018 --> 00:15:51,753
Such a pathetic fool.

189
00:16:03,632 --> 00:16:05,567
[Screech]

190
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:10,338
[Screech]

191
00:16:17,579 --> 00:16:20,048
[Heavy Breathing]
What's going on?!

192
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:23,752
[Screech]

193
00:16:23,819 --> 00:16:25,921
[Gasps] You've got to be kidding
me.

194
00:16:25,987 --> 00:16:28,023
How are we supposed to
fight that huge thing?

195
00:16:28,089 --> 00:16:29,858
Hold on. Something's
not right.

196
00:16:32,394 --> 00:16:33,328
What's this?

197
00:16:34,062 --> 00:16:36,398
Wow! This future technology
is just amazing!

198
00:16:36,832 --> 00:16:37,799
Observe.

199
00:16:39,601 --> 00:16:43,805
If these energy readings are
correct, to fight this creature,
you must see its actual form.

200
00:16:44,906 --> 00:16:49,778
That giant dragon we're seeing
was created by enormously
amplified life energy.

201
00:16:50,011 --> 00:16:52,814
Energy initiated by
a human mind.

202
00:16:52,914 --> 00:16:53,915
Are you serious?

203
00:16:55,584 --> 00:16:57,919
What kind of sick mind would
even think of making a huge ugly
monster like that?

204
00:16:58,019 --> 00:16:58,453
[Gasp]

205
00:16:59,087 --> 00:17:00,956
It's trying to destroy
the barrier!

206
00:17:02,557 --> 00:17:04,392
We'll have to go outside and
distract it, before it's able to
break through.

207
00:17:04,826 --> 00:17:05,927
Oh, darn it.

208
00:17:06,528 --> 00:17:08,496
We have to do
whatever we can.

209
00:17:10,365 --> 00:17:12,934
The main reason we came to the
future was to help, and that's
what we need to do right now.

210
00:17:13,034 --> 00:17:13,935
Mhmm.

211
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:17,105
Please look after Chibi-Usa,
I mean, Small Lady.

212
00:17:19,507 --> 00:17:21,877
Good luck, Sailor Guardians.

213
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:36,091
[Screech]

214
00:17:36,758 --> 00:17:40,662
[Nervous Breathing] It's really
humungous up close!

215
00:17:40,729 --> 00:17:42,430
You can do this, Sailor Moon!

216
00:17:42,898 --> 00:17:44,666
[Screech]

217
00:17:44,866 --> 00:17:46,067
[Gasps]

218
00:17:46,334 --> 00:17:46,968
[Screams]

219
00:17:47,068 --> 00:17:47,702
[Grunts]

220
00:17:48,837 --> 00:17:50,739
Any bright ideas on
how to fight that thing?

221
00:17:50,906 --> 00:17:52,641
[Screech]

222
00:17:52,774 --> 00:17:55,076
I say we just go for it!

223
00:17:55,677 --> 00:17:58,046
Venus Love Me Chain!

224
00:18:00,048 --> 00:18:01,383
[Screeches]

225
00:18:01,783 --> 00:18:03,051
[Screams]
[Grunts]

226
00:18:03,385 --> 00:18:04,352
Venus!

227
00:18:04,419 --> 00:18:05,787
Did it work?

228
00:18:05,887 --> 00:18:07,389
Damn, guess not.

229
00:18:09,758 --> 00:18:12,861
Wait! The scan shows that it
clearly did some damage!

230
00:18:13,728 --> 00:18:14,896
[Both] Everyone, hang in there!

231
00:18:17,766 --> 00:18:18,900
Serenity.

232
00:18:20,101 --> 00:18:22,704
If you can hear me, please give
those Sailor Guardians strength.

233
00:18:24,906 --> 00:18:26,007
[Gasps]

234
00:18:26,908 --> 00:18:28,677
Small Lady.

235
00:18:29,444 --> 00:18:30,645
[Screech]

236
00:18:34,049 --> 00:18:34,983
[Groaning]

237
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:35,784
It's coming!

238
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:39,387
[Screams]

239
00:18:39,454 --> 00:18:40,722
[Grunts]

240
00:18:40,789 --> 00:18:42,057
Are you okay, Sailor Moon?

241
00:18:42,324 --> 00:18:43,058
Mhmm.

242
00:18:43,325 --> 00:18:44,059
My turn.

243
00:18:44,359 --> 00:18:47,796
Sparkling Wide Pressure!

244
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:50,098
[Screech]

245
00:18:54,669 --> 00:18:55,837
I think I got it.

246
00:18:55,937 --> 00:18:58,039
Yay! I knew you could do it!

247
00:18:58,373 --> 00:18:59,774
[Gasps]

248
00:18:59,975 --> 00:19:01,810
Take that you ugly monster!

249
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:04,346
Wait! Don't go near it! It's
still dangerous!

250
00:19:04,646 --> 00:19:06,047
Don't worry, I'll be fine.

251
00:19:06,314 --> 00:19:06,848
[Roars]

252
00:19:06,915 --> 00:19:07,716
[Gasps]

253
00:19:07,849 --> 00:19:09,050
[Screams]

254
00:19:09,417 --> 00:19:10,719
[Screeches]

255
00:19:11,386 --> 00:19:11,987
[Gasps]

256
00:19:12,754 --> 00:19:13,788
Hmph!

257
00:19:14,789 --> 00:19:16,791
Sorry, I guess you were right.

258
00:19:16,891 --> 00:19:18,059
Let's double up!

259
00:19:18,326 --> 00:19:18,927
All right.

260
00:19:19,094 --> 00:19:20,829
[Screech]

261
00:19:21,863 --> 00:19:24,599
Burning!

262
00:19:26,001 --> 00:19:28,903
Mandala!

263
00:19:32,907 --> 00:19:37,012
Shine Aqua Illusion!

264
00:19:39,381 --> 00:19:40,782
[Roars]

265
00:19:42,017 --> 00:19:42,817
[Roars]

266
00:19:42,917 --> 00:19:43,918
[Gasps]

267
00:19:44,686 --> 00:19:46,654
This'll take forever,
it's useless!

268
00:19:46,721 --> 00:19:49,090
I'm afraid we're incapable
of stopping it!

269
00:19:49,391 --> 00:19:50,625
Don't give up now!

270
00:19:51,726 --> 00:19:54,662
Believe that the power of
justice will always prevail.

271
00:19:54,763 --> 00:19:57,799
Remember King Endymion's words,
see its true form!

272
00:19:57,899 --> 00:19:59,801
That's right I almost forgot.

273
00:19:59,901 --> 00:20:01,803
That thing is made
up of energy.

274
00:20:02,804 --> 00:20:04,773
From a human.

275
00:20:04,939 --> 00:20:08,777
[Screech]

276
00:20:08,943 --> 00:20:09,944
[Gasps] Look out!

277
00:20:11,012 --> 00:20:12,747
Follow me, Sailor Moon!

278
00:20:12,981 --> 00:20:13,948
Okay.

279
00:20:14,382 --> 00:20:15,884
[Roaring]

280
00:20:17,052 --> 00:20:18,787
[Grunting]

00:20:20,688 --> 00:20:21,689
[Screeching]

282
00:20:23,391 --> 00:20:25,660
Okay, do it now Sailor Moon!

283
00:20:26,061 --> 00:20:27,662
Yeah, all right.

284
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:33,968
I'm counting on you, Moon Rod.

285
00:20:54,022 --> 00:21:01,796
Moon Princess Halation!

286
00:21:20,615 --> 00:21:22,650
[Gasps] Esmeraude?

287
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:37,098
[Screams]

288
00:21:40,635 --> 00:21:42,537
Prince Demande.

289
00:21:44,539 --> 00:21:46,040
Esmeraude.

290
00:21:46,641 --> 00:21:48,710
They did it! They won, Luna!

291
00:21:50,545 --> 00:21:51,646
Your Majesty?

292
00:21:53,414 --> 00:21:56,518
It seems Small Lady has
disappeared. She's nowhere to be
found within the Crystal Palace.

293
00:21:56,618 --> 00:21:57,785
What?!

294
00:22:04,792 --> 00:22:11,766
So, Esmeraude has fallen to her
demise into a dark void. Well,
it was inevitable.

295
00:22:11,833 --> 00:22:17,472
After all, my true objective is
not to help the Black Moon Clan
get their revenge.

296
00:22:17,539 --> 00:22:24,946
And eventually, Prince Demande
and Saphir will be persuaded to
give up their lives for my great
cause, as well.

297
00:22:25,313 --> 00:22:29,584
The true power that I seek is
already in my possession.

298
00:22:29,651 --> 00:22:31,920
[Evil Giggles]

299
00:24:10,413 --> 00:24:17,353
Small Lady, you poor thing, no
one will ever love you for who
you are. But don't concern
yourself with that.

300
00:24:17,353 --> 00:24:23,954
Embrace this Dark Power, and I
assure you that everything
you've ever wished for will be
yours!

301
00:24:23,954 --> 00:24:28,155
Don't listen to him,
Chibi-Usa! We do love you!
Try to remember!

302
00:24:28,155 --> 00:24:33,093
Next time on Sailor Moon R: "The
Dark Queen: Birth of Black
Lady."

303
00:24:33,093 --> 00:24:35,962
The moonlight is a
messenger of love.
