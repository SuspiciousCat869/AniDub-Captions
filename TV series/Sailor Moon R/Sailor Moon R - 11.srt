00:12:48,322 --> 00:12:49,489
Where is it now?

156
00:12:51,489 --> 00:12:53,456
<i>Near the cram school I go to,</i>
<i>but it ran off toward the</i>
<i>northwest and disappeared.</i>

157
00:12:54,256 --> 00:12:57,122
Understood. All of us will meet
you near there!

158
00:12:57,156 --> 00:12:58,456
C'mon, we gotta go Rei.

159
00:12:58,922 --> 00:13:00,956
But the movie's just
getting good!

160
00:13:01,189 --> 00:13:03,556
Come on! Hurry it up
and get moving!

161
00:13:03,956 --> 00:13:05,822
Okay, okay I get it!

162
00:13:06,256 --> 00:13:08,189
He looks just like Alan...

163
00:13:08,456 --> 00:13:10,089
Minako, let's go!

164
00:13:17,622 --> 00:13:20,822
No! I can't figure it out!
[Sigh]

165
00:13:21,422 --> 00:13:22,456
Hmph!

166
00:13:24,189 --> 00:13:24,856
Oh...

167
00:13:25,056 --> 00:13:25,789
[Heavy Breathing]

168
00:13:26,089 --> 00:13:27,089
[Screams]

169
00:13:27,589 --> 00:13:29,256
What are you doing, Natsumi?

170
00:13:29,456 --> 00:13:31,456
Oh, I...[Laughing]

171
00:13:31,489 --> 00:13:34,456
I'm just getting some exercise
to keep up my mood!

172
00:13:37,556 --> 00:13:39,356
Aman!

173
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:45,289
Stop Amanju! I told you,
your target is...

174
00:13:45,322 --> 00:13:46,256
Aman!

175
00:13:47,089 --> 00:13:49,356
What is the matter with you
Amanju?!

176
00:13:49,389 --> 00:13:53,456
It isn't possible for a Cardian
to disobey my orders! What is
happening here?!

177
00:14:05,456 --> 00:14:07,356
<i>I'm not going to give up.</i>

178
00:14:12,422 --> 00:14:14,456
[Yawns]

179
00:14:14,856 --> 00:14:16,222
Ow!

180
00:14:16,256 --> 00:14:16,878
Huh?

181
00:14:16,878 --> 00:14:18,489
Oh, sorry!

182
00:14:18,856 --> 00:14:20,822
But that was kinda your own
fault.

183
00:14:20,856 --> 00:14:23,089
You shouldn't sneak up
behind me like that!

184
00:14:23,589 --> 00:14:27,856
[Sigh] Why does everything seem
to be going wrong for me today?

185
00:14:28,156 --> 00:14:32,422
[Sigh] I wonder what could be
keeping Ms. Haruna. We've been
here forever!

186
00:14:38,022 --> 00:14:42,856
[Sigh] I feel like I've
forgotten something, but I
don't know what it could be...

187
00:14:43,889 --> 00:14:46,422
Oh well! I guess it couldn't
be all that important!

188
00:14:48,389 --> 00:14:49,156
Aman!

189
00:14:49,189 --> 00:14:50,089
Aman!
Huh?

190
00:14:50,122 --> 00:14:51,189
[Screams]

191
00:14:51,622 --> 00:14:53,056
[Gasp]

192
00:14:54,489 --> 00:14:59,889
All right! Just steal human
energy from someone, anyone.

193
00:14:59,922 --> 00:15:01,356
Understand, Amanju?

194
00:15:01,389 --> 00:15:03,422
Aman!

195
00:15:04,122 --> 00:15:06,156
[Struggling]

196
00:15:06,189 --> 00:15:10,089
What are you doing?! I don't
want energy from those birds!

197
00:15:10,122 --> 00:15:11,256
Humans! Humans!

198
00:15:11,289 --> 00:15:12,389
<i>That's enough!</i>

199
00:15:12,422 --> 00:15:12,922
Huh?

200
00:15:13,789 --> 00:15:15,789
Ah ha! Sneaking up on victims
again?!

201
00:15:16,189 --> 00:15:19,222
You've got guts to try that
trick a second time, that's
for sure!

202
00:15:19,956 --> 00:15:23,456
It's a serious crime to
disturb the peaceful lives of
those birds!

203
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:25,456
We won't let you
get away with this!

204
00:15:26,156 --> 00:15:29,222
Now, in the name of Sailor Moon,
we'll punish you!

205
00:15:29,256 --> 00:15:32,122
[Laughing] So you've come,
Sailor Guardians!

206
00:15:32,156 --> 00:15:35,256
But this time, things will be
quite different, I assure you!

207
00:15:35,289 --> 00:15:36,622
Get them, Amanju!

208
00:15:36,656 --> 00:15:39,056
Aman!

209
00:15:39,522 --> 00:15:41,122
Huh?
[Grunts]

210
00:15:41,422 --> 00:15:41,856
Huh?

211
00:15:41,889 --> 00:15:43,789
[Grunts] Again?

212
00:15:44,889 --> 00:15:46,022
It ran away...

213
00:15:46,322 --> 00:15:48,089
Does that mean we won?

214
00:15:49,922 --> 00:15:53,822
I can't believe it! Just one
more problem to go and I'm
finished!

215
00:15:54,056 --> 00:15:56,789
Natsumi! How are you doing? You
almost done?

216
00:15:57,189 --> 00:15:59,556
Uh...yeah I'll manage somehow...

217
00:15:59,922 --> 00:16:02,222
Okay! But I'm not gonna lose!

218
00:16:03,389 --> 00:16:06,289
You are a worthy opponent,
Usagi Tsukino...

219
00:16:06,589 --> 00:16:09,889
<i>You've left me no</i>
<i>openings. Well done.</i>

220
00:16:10,256 --> 00:16:13,289
Natsumi, are you okay? You
don't look good.

221
00:16:13,489 --> 00:16:16,489
And you haven't done a single
problem either!

222
00:16:16,522 --> 00:16:21,156
It's nothing. I'm just a bit
tired, and I can't get my
thoughts together, that's all.

223
00:16:21,189 --> 00:16:24,489
[Chuckles] Is there anything I
can do to help you?

224
00:16:24,522 --> 00:16:25,356
What's that?

225
00:16:26,422 --> 00:16:28,922
You can just call it the
compassion of the victor!

226
00:16:28,956 --> 00:16:31,422
But if there's anything I can
do, you just name it, okay?

227
00:16:32,522 --> 00:16:37,056
I once heard an Earth legend
about a race between a rabbit
and a tortoise...

228
00:16:37,089 --> 00:16:40,056
...that story went very much
like this one.

229
00:16:41,389 --> 00:16:42,289
Something wrong?

230
00:16:43,356 --> 00:16:46,422
All right, then. I do have a
favor to ask of you.

231
00:16:46,456 --> 00:16:51,889
Okay. But wait, you can't ask me
for the answers or tell me to
give up on Mamoru, you got it?

232
00:16:51,922 --> 00:16:53,989
Don't worry, it's
nothing like that.

233
00:16:55,789 --> 00:16:58,956
All I want you to do is
close your eyes and remain
completely still for just ten
seconds.

234
00:16:58,989 --> 00:17:01,022
What? Really, that's it?

235
00:17:01,056 --> 00:17:02,489
Just ten seconds?

236
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:04,089
All right, here it goes!

237
00:17:04,122 --> 00:17:05,189
Thank you.

238
00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:10,056
Now sleep for all
eternity, Usagi Tsukino!

239
00:17:12,422 --> 00:17:14,556
Oh, woah, I feel weird...

240
00:17:15,156 --> 00:17:16,989
[Chuckles]

241
00:17:17,256 --> 00:17:17,956
Aman!

242
00:17:17,989 --> 00:17:18,407
Huh?

243
00:17:18,589 --> 00:17:19,289
Huh! What?

244
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:21,522
Aman!

245
00:17:21,989 --> 00:17:23,256
<i>Was that a Cardian?</i>

246
00:17:24,356 --> 00:17:25,289
Ail!

247
00:17:26,889 --> 00:17:29,889
<i>Something is very odd. The</i>
<i>Cardian won't listen to my</i>
<i>orders.</i>

248
00:17:30,456 --> 00:17:32,789
<i>What?! But that's impossible!</i>

249
00:17:33,156 --> 00:17:34,422
Just come with me...

250
00:17:35,922 --> 00:17:36,822
[Gasp]

251
00:17:38,122 --> 00:17:39,889
We got you now, Cardian!

252
00:17:39,922 --> 00:17:41,856
Fire...!

253
00:17:44,889 --> 00:17:46,356
Soul!

254
00:17:50,189 --> 00:17:52,122
Supreme...!

255
00:17:57,322 --> 00:17:58,822
Thunder!

256
00:17:59,356 --> 00:18:01,256
Crescent...!

257
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:03,956
Beam!

258
00:18:03,989 --> 00:18:05,522
Shower!

259
00:18:06,422 --> 00:18:09,322
Bubble Spray...!

260
00:18:11,489 --> 00:18:13,189
Freezing!

261
00:18:19,956 --> 00:18:22,189
[Heavy Breathing]

262
00:18:22,222 --> 00:18:24,056
Aman!

263
00:18:24,089 --> 00:18:25,989
[Screams]

264
00:18:26,022 --> 00:18:29,556
The Cardian is strong! They
won't last long without help!

265
00:18:30,889 --> 00:18:32,422
Oh, there's Usagi!

266
00:18:32,889 --> 00:18:35,289
Hey! I'll go get her
to come down here!

267
00:18:38,389 --> 00:18:41,189
You see? That Cardian isn't
listening to me.

268
00:18:41,856 --> 00:18:46,022
But how can this be? It
shouldn't be possible for a
Cardian to ignore your orders!

269
00:18:46,056 --> 00:18:47,522
Still, that's what
happened...

270
00:18:47,889 --> 00:18:49,456
[Screams]

271
00:18:49,889 --> 00:18:51,289
Hang in there, guys!

272
00:18:51,622 --> 00:18:55,056
Usagi! Stop being so
laid back and transform!

273
00:18:55,089 --> 00:18:57,322
Luna? Hey wait, where's
Natsumi?

274
00:18:57,356 --> 00:18:59,422
I don't know! Just hurry!

275
00:18:59,456 --> 00:19:01,189
K! Leave it to me!

276
00:19:01,222 --> 00:19:04,056
Moon Crystal Power!

277
00:19:04,089 --> 00:19:06,189
Make up!

278
00:19:47,056 --> 00:19:48,489
Yeah!

279
00:19:48,522 --> 00:19:49,956
Sorry I'm late!

280
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:51,789
No kidding.

281
00:19:53,289 --> 00:19:55,522
Now, now. Give me a break. I
always manage to finish these
things off!

282
00:19:56,356 --> 00:19:58,289
Aman!

283
00:19:58,856 --> 00:20:02,056
Woah, that's weird I have no
energy left...

284
00:20:02,089 --> 00:20:03,589
What's wrong with
you Sailor Moon?

285
00:20:03,622 --> 00:20:06,122
Maybe I studied too hard or
something...

286
00:20:06,322 --> 00:20:07,522
Aman!

287
00:20:07,922 --> 00:20:09,122
[Struggled Screams]

288
00:20:10,322 --> 00:20:10,989
[Screams]

289
00:20:13,889 --> 00:20:16,922
A wicked world is where the
wicked like you belong.

290
00:20:17,322 --> 00:20:21,122
Now, begone at once from the
light of this lovely moon!

291
00:20:21,422 --> 00:20:24,356
Moonlight Knight! What great
timing!

292
00:20:24,856 --> 00:20:26,789
Now, Sailor Moon...Finish her!

293
00:20:27,089 --> 00:20:28,122
Right!

294
00:20:47,289 --> 00:20:53,956
Moon Princess Halation!

295
00:20:57,389 --> 00:21:00,222
Cleansing!

296
00:21:06,456 --> 00:21:08,022
We did it!

297
00:21:09,489 --> 00:21:14,522
The crescent moon itself is no
match for a Pretty Guardian!
Adieu...!

298
00:21:15,122 --> 00:21:18,922
Well all right then! With that
done I better get back to the
classroom!

299
00:21:18,956 --> 00:21:21,322
Natsumi will be wondering what
happened to me! [Giggling]

300
00:21:21,356 --> 00:21:23,222
All of the sudden,
she's full of energy!

301
00:21:23,256 --> 00:21:25,856
There's nobody who can
bounce back like she can...

302
00:21:25,889 --> 00:21:27,322
Yep, that's Sailor Moon
for you!

303
00:21:27,356 --> 00:21:30,222
Okay, we ought to get out of
here as well!

304
00:21:30,256 --> 00:21:30,889
Mhmm.

305
00:21:31,589 --> 00:21:33,156
We failed yet another time...

306
00:21:33,189 --> 00:21:36,222
[Grunts] Curse those Sailor
Guardians!

307
00:21:36,256 --> 00:21:39,022
Well, I better get back to the
classroom now.

308
00:21:39,056 --> 00:21:42,156
If I don't, Tsukino will start
to get suspicious of me.

309
00:21:43,056 --> 00:21:46,156
[Grunts] Something's up.

310
00:21:46,189 --> 00:21:51,022
It feels like something big's
going to happen. Or that
something already has...

311
00:21:51,056 --> 00:21:53,256
All right I'm finished!

312
00:21:53,289 --> 00:21:54,289
Oh, yeah?

313
00:21:54,522 --> 00:21:55,122
Huh?

314
00:21:55,156 --> 00:21:56,822
Natsumi, when did you...?

315
00:21:58,689 --> 00:22:02,789
I only finished a moment ago
myself. Once I put my mind
to it, these took me no time at
all.

316
00:22:03,122 --> 00:22:05,156
Hey! Let's go home Usagi.

317
00:22:05,456 --> 00:22:07,022
It looks like you
worked hard!

318
00:22:07,322 --> 00:22:08,289
I did!

319
00:22:09,456 --> 00:22:11,556
Well, Natsumi, I think that
today's match was a draw!

320
00:22:13,156 --> 00:22:15,956
Yeah, guess so. Looks like we'll
just have to settle this by
letting Mamoru decide.

321
00:22:16,222 --> 00:22:20,022
Okay! But there's no way I'm
gonna lose! See ya!

322
00:22:22,589 --> 00:22:25,122
<i>Oh we'll see about that...</i>

323
00:24:11,613 --> 00:24:16,646
Hey, Luna! Have you noticed that
Seijuro and Natsumi haven't come
to school in a while?

324
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,346
Maybe we should go
check on them!

325
00:24:18,546 --> 00:24:21,046
<i>They probably caught</i>
<i>laziness from you!</i>

326
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,113
Luna!

327
00:24:23,446 --> 00:24:27,113
Wow, Seijuro's apartment sure is
nice! Hey, what's with this
room?!

328
00:24:27,146 --> 00:24:28,080
[Screams]

329
00:24:28,113 --> 00:24:29,446
<i>That's the Makai Tree!</i>

330
00:24:31,146 --> 00:24:34,913
<i>Next time on Sailor Moon R:</i>
"Disconnecting Love: The Raging
<i>Makai Tree"</i>

331
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,278
<i>The moonlight is a</i>
<i>messenger of love.</i>
