1
00:01:58,408 --> 00:02:05,075
Ami, thank you for everything
you've done for us and please
don't forget us while you're
in Germany...

2
00:02:05,108 --> 00:02:13,242
And as for you, monster...
Anyone who tries to prevent Ami
from pursing her dreams will
have to answer me, Sailor Moon!

3
00:02:13,275 --> 00:02:16,608
Douse yourself in
water and repent!

4
00:02:23,442 --> 00:02:29,008
"A Guardian's Friendship:
Goodbye, Ami."

5
00:02:35,708 --> 00:02:39,042
Huh?
Whoa...

6
00:02:46,608 --> 00:02:49,742
Whaa!

7
00:02:49,775 --> 00:02:53,075
Oh, wow!
Chocolate chip
mint! Mm!

8
00:02:53,108 --> 00:03:00,575
What's the matter with me?
Ice cream is kid's stuff.
Right now I need to focus on
finding the Silver Crystal.

9
00:03:00,608 --> 00:03:02,075
(Ami)
Chibi-Usa!

10
00:03:02,108 --> 00:03:04,075
You going home?

11
00:03:04,108 --> 00:03:05,508
Uh yeah.

12
00:03:05,542 --> 00:03:07,442
What were you
staring at
down there?

13
00:03:07,475 --> 00:03:08,575
Nothing.

14
00:03:08,608 --> 00:03:12,075
Oh, I see.
You were looking
at the new
ice-cream shop.

15
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:14,042
I don't have any
interest in that.

16
00:03:14,075 --> 00:03:16,608
Really? I hear
their ice-cream
is quite good.

17
00:03:16,642 --> 00:03:20,175
I'd like to try it,
so I'm actually thinking
of going there right now.

18
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:22,675
Want to come with
me, Chibi-Usa?
I'll treat you.

19
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:26,742
You will?! Well, if
you insist, I guess
I'llcome with you.
[giggles]

20
00:03:26,775 --> 00:03:29,442
Hey Ami,
hurry up!

21
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:31,075
[small giggle]

22
00:03:31,108 --> 00:03:33,008
(Usagi)
What?! No way!

23
00:03:33,042 --> 00:03:34,742
I'm afraid it's
true Usagi.

24
00:03:34,775 --> 00:03:38,175
Ami's been invited
to go to Germany to
pursue her studies.

25
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:42,275
She did have the
top score on the
national mock exams
several times.

26
00:03:42,308 --> 00:03:46,208
I'm surprised this never
came up before and we're
just hearing about it for
the first time.

27
00:03:46,242 --> 00:03:47,342
So, did she
say yes?

28
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:49,342
(Rei)
She hasn't given
her response yet.

29
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:51,708
But I imagine
she'll want
to go.

30
00:03:51,742 --> 00:03:56,208
Ami's dream has always
been to study medicine,
to become a doctor just
like her Mom.

31
00:03:56,242 --> 00:03:59,075
(Makoto)
And Germany is one
of the best places
to go for that.

32
00:03:59,108 --> 00:04:03,042
(Usagi)
But-but-but..
I don't want to have
to say goodbye to Ami!

33
00:04:03,075 --> 00:04:07,608
And also, we rely on Ami
to figure things out for us.
We need her here to be our
brain!

34
00:04:07,642 --> 00:04:10,442
We can't just call
Germany every time
an enemy appears!

35
00:04:10,475 --> 00:04:14,642
Usagi! That may be true,
but we have to take Ami's
feelings into consideration.

36
00:04:14,675 --> 00:04:18,142
Yeah, it's gonna be
really tough without
Ami around, that's
for sure.

37
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:22,142
But we'll manage. We just
have to work a lot harder
to figure everything out.

38
00:04:22,175 --> 00:04:26,108
So you're all saying you're
okay with her leaving us
even though we might never
see her again?!

39
00:04:26,142 --> 00:04:30,475
Ami has been a loyal guardian
even when fighting took her
away from her studies.

40
00:04:30,508 --> 00:04:34,175
She never complained.
But now her hard work
is about to pay off.

41
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:40,175
(Rei)
We can't be childish and hold
her back just because it would
be easier for us if she stays.

42
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:45,442
I want her to fulfill her
dream. It's not every day
that an opportunity like
this comes along.

43
00:04:45,475 --> 00:04:51,108
You even said it yourself,
Usagi.. That you want everyone
to live normal lives of their
own choosing.

44
00:04:51,142 --> 00:04:55,308
Y-You're right.
Let's make sure Ami
goes to Germany to
live her dream!

45
00:04:55,342 --> 00:04:57,342
Good. I knew you
would come around.

46
00:04:57,375 --> 00:05:01,142
Now that we're on the same
page, why don't we plan a
farewell party for Ami?

47
00:05:01,175 --> 00:05:02,542
Let's do it!

48
00:05:02,575 --> 00:05:05,075
It's almost time
for my cram school.

49
00:05:05,108 --> 00:05:08,242
I better go now.
I'll see you later,
Chibi-Usa.

50
00:05:08,275 --> 00:05:10,175
Bye! Thanks for
the ice cream.

51
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:12,108
Ami sure is
responsible.

52
00:05:12,142 --> 00:05:18,608
I think that she would be
more likely to have the
Silver Crystal, than someone
as immature as Usagi.

53
00:05:18,642 --> 00:05:24,242
(Atemis)
These are your new
transformation sticks and
communicator wrist bands.

54
00:05:24,275 --> 00:05:28,342
(Luna)
Now you'll have access
to even more power than
before.

55
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:32,042
(Usagi)
Looks like Ami won't
get to use hers.

56
00:05:32,075 --> 00:05:34,242
[sign]

57
00:05:41,775 --> 00:05:44,275
(Rubeus)
Berthier.

58
00:05:44,308 --> 00:05:46,642
Yes, sir.

59
00:05:46,675 --> 00:05:50,708
I've found another
Crystal Point barrier
protecting Crystal Tokyo.

60
00:05:50,742 --> 00:05:54,008
(Rubeus)
And it's
right there.

61
00:05:59,475 --> 00:06:04,342
So all we have to do now
is to go down there and
replace its Crystal Power
with our Dark Power.

62
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:05,442
That's the
plan, right?

63
00:06:05,475 --> 00:06:06,475
(Rubeus)
Yes...

64
00:06:06,508 --> 00:06:08,542
Are you going to
be able to handle
it this time?

65
00:06:08,575 --> 00:06:12,642
You might as well
kiss it good-bye
right now.
[blows kiss]

66
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:16,808
Yeah...

67
00:06:16,842 --> 00:06:18,375
I'm pretty sure
you're right.

68
00:06:18,408 --> 00:06:19,308
Ami!

69
00:06:19,342 --> 00:06:22,408
Chibi-Usa?!
You shouldn't
be out so late!

70
00:06:22,442 --> 00:06:24,442
I've been waiting
here to ask you
something.

71
00:06:24,475 --> 00:06:26,008
(Ami)
Huh?

72
00:06:26,042 --> 00:06:28,375
I want to stay at
your place for a
little while, if that's
all right with you.

73
00:06:28,408 --> 00:06:31,642
What happened?
Did you and Usagi get
into another big fight?

74
00:06:31,675 --> 00:06:33,475
No, it's
nothing
like that.

75
00:06:33,508 --> 00:06:37,542
Just that I like to study,
but it's hard to concentrate
with her around.

76
00:06:37,575 --> 00:06:40,442
[laughing]

77
00:06:40,475 --> 00:06:44,575
I get it. No need to
explain. You're welcome
to stay at my place.

78
00:06:44,608 --> 00:06:47,508
I'll give Usagi a call
and let her know where
you are. Let's go.

79
00:06:47,542 --> 00:06:51,575
[giggles]
Oh thank you!

80
00:06:57,075 --> 00:06:59,442
[nodding off]

81
00:06:59,475 --> 00:07:01,208
Chibi-Usa?

82
00:07:01,242 --> 00:07:05,342
[gasp]
I wanna go
to sleep.

83
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:08,708
[small chuckle]
It's only a little
past ten. We have
at least another hour.

84
00:07:08,742 --> 00:07:14,775
Ten o'clock?! Oh no, I have
to go to bed. My teacher said
I have to rest my eyes by ten
o'clock every night!

85
00:07:14,808 --> 00:07:19,508
Well, it's not good to use your
eyes to watch TV at night, but
studying is a whole different
matter.

86
00:07:19,542 --> 00:07:22,342
So, take a big breath
and hang in there a
little longer.

87
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:26,042
[sign]
What's her deal anyway?
She never takes a break.

88
00:07:26,075 --> 00:07:28,742
I can't even begin to
look for the Silver
Crystal.

89
00:07:28,775 --> 00:07:30,242
Huh?!
What is it?

90
00:07:30,275 --> 00:07:33,642
Chibi-Usa, where did
you actually come from?

91
00:07:33,675 --> 00:07:34,575
Huh?

92
00:07:34,608 --> 00:07:38,442
You're not really
Usagi's cousin,
are you?

93
00:07:38,475 --> 00:07:40,342
Uhh..

94
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:47,442
If you don't want to talk
about it, that's all right.
But, if you have nowhere
to go permanently...

95
00:07:47,475 --> 00:07:49,108
(Ami)
You could
stay here.

96
00:07:49,142 --> 00:07:50,708
Huh?

97
00:07:50,742 --> 00:07:53,642
You'd have this room to
yourself, since I might not
be living here much longer...

98
00:07:53,675 --> 00:07:56,475
...and you could keep
my mom company while
I'm away.

99
00:07:56,508 --> 00:07:59,108
Oh, are you going
somewhere, Ami?

100
00:07:59,142 --> 00:08:03,408
Mm.. Yes, I have an
opportunity to fulfill
one of my biggest dreams.

101
00:08:03,442 --> 00:08:05,375
Your leaving
for your dreams?

102
00:08:05,408 --> 00:08:12,608
Hmm.. But, I can't go.
I can't leave Usagi and the
others on their own. I'm sorry.
Forget what I said.

103
00:08:12,642 --> 00:08:15,642
Ahh..

104
00:08:15,675 --> 00:08:19,075
Ami, Ami!

105
00:08:19,108 --> 00:08:20,742
Usagi..

106
00:08:20,775 --> 00:08:25,042
[giggles]
Come on Ami,
let's go!

107
00:08:25,075 --> 00:08:27,175
No. I can't.

108
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:29,142
(Usagi)
Why?!

109
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:32,508
Sorry, but I can't
be with you anymore,
Usagi.

110
00:08:32,542 --> 00:08:34,708
What?-Why not?

111
00:08:34,742 --> 00:08:37,375
I'm going
somewhere
far away.

112
00:08:37,408 --> 00:08:38,475
[gasp]

113
00:08:38,508 --> 00:08:39,342
(Ami)
Good-Bye.

114
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:41,675
(Ami and Mamoru)
We'll never meet
again.

115
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:44,375
M-Mamo...

116
00:08:44,408 --> 00:08:47,375
I don't have
feelings for
you anymore.

117
00:08:47,408 --> 00:08:48,542
[gasp]

118
00:08:48,575 --> 00:08:50,175
Goodbye, Usagi

119
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:52,142
Goodbye, Bun-head.

120
00:08:52,175 --> 00:08:54,575
No! Please, wait!

121
00:08:54,608 --> 00:08:57,175
Ami! Mamo...

122
00:09:04,242 --> 00:09:05,175
(Berthier)
Hmm...

123
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:07,642
Niphas!
Are you
there?

124
00:09:07,675 --> 00:09:12,508
Yes, master.

125
00:09:12,542 --> 00:09:14,042
(Berthier)
Let's get
started.

126
00:09:14,075 --> 00:09:17,408
Operation;
"Some like
it cold."

127
00:09:17,442 --> 00:09:23,042
[exhaile]

128
00:09:23,075 --> 00:09:28,008
[giggles]
Very well done.
Now its time
for phase two.

129
00:09:28,042 --> 00:09:30,508
(Niphas)
Yes, master!

130
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:32,475
(Usagi)
Good morning Ami!

131
00:09:32,508 --> 00:09:33,608
(Ami)
'Morning!

132
00:09:33,642 --> 00:09:36,575
Thanks for looking
after Chibi-Usa
last night.
[yawn]

133
00:09:36,608 --> 00:09:39,675
It was my pleasure.
Come over again,
any time.

134
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:41,142
Thanks!

135
00:09:41,175 --> 00:09:45,342
I'll keep going over there
again and again until I
find the Silver Crystal!

136
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:47,375
(Ami)
What?! A farewell
party for me?

137
00:09:47,408 --> 00:09:50,175
But why? I haven't
made my decision yet.

138
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:54,408
What are you talking about?
I heard you were good to go
and your departure date was
set.

139
00:09:54,442 --> 00:09:55,675
I still have
ten days.

140
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:56,642
What? That's it?

141
00:09:56,675 --> 00:09:59,508
I've already made
all the arrangements
but...

142
00:09:59,542 --> 00:10:02,608
...I'm just not sure.
Maybe I should stay.

143
00:10:02,642 --> 00:10:06,208
Ami forget about staying
here. You have to go.
It's important.

144
00:10:06,242 --> 00:10:12,408
I want you to learn a whole lot
of medical stuff so that you can
become a great doctor who is
able to save a ton of lives!

145
00:10:12,442 --> 00:10:13,808
Usagi...

146
00:10:13,842 --> 00:10:17,042
(Usagi)
All of us feel the same
way! We just want the
best for you!

147
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:18,842
[giggles]

148
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:21,608
(Rei)
What do you mean she doesn't
want us to throw her a farewell
party or see her off? Why?

149
00:10:21,642 --> 00:10:25,375
Are you trying to tell us that
Ami's decided not to go?

150
00:10:25,408 --> 00:10:31,108
No she's made
up her mind.
It's just...

151
00:10:31,142 --> 00:10:35,242
I can't... I've never really
been good with saying
goodbye to people I love.

152
00:10:35,275 --> 00:10:41,475
And if you were to throw me a
farewell party or go to see me
off, it would make it even more
difficult for me to leave.

153
00:10:41,508 --> 00:10:46,175
I know it sounds
selfish, but try
to understand.

154
00:10:48,242 --> 00:10:50,708
Well, that's our
Ami all right.

155
00:10:50,742 --> 00:10:54,542
Even if that's what
she said, we should
still say goodbye
somehow!

156
00:10:54,575 --> 00:10:59,375
Maybe the best way to do
it is to go to the airport
and see her off just as
she boards the plane?

157
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:00,675
That's a
good idea!

158
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:02,108
Sounds like
a plan.

159
00:11:02,142 --> 00:11:04,008
Then we're all
in agreement.

160
00:11:04,042 --> 00:11:09,175
Yeah, let's do it!

161
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:15,475
Sailor Moon

162
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:16,530
R!

163
00:11:28,727 --> 00:11:33,894
Sailor Moon R!

164
00:11:35,227 --> 00:11:40,527
Delicious ice cream!
Get your ice cream
here!

165
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,060
Here you go.

166
00:11:42,094 --> 00:11:45,360
Thanks sweetie. I heard
the ice cream here is
supposed to be
super-delicious.

167
00:11:45,394 --> 00:11:46,327
[small chuckle]

168
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,894
You're way
too clingy!

169
00:11:48,927 --> 00:11:50,560
I've had enough
of you, too.

170
00:11:50,594 --> 00:11:51,135
Fine!
Fine!

171
00:11:51,135 --> 00:11:51,994
I'm out of here!

172
00:11:52,027 --> 00:11:52,927
Good ridden!

173
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,294
Hmm?

174
00:11:54,327 --> 00:11:59,194
Beat the heat! Have some
tasty ice cream! Ma'am,
would you like some?

175
00:11:59,227 --> 00:12:02,760
[giggles]
Seems like business
is going well.

176
00:12:02,794 --> 00:12:04,660
Yes.

177
00:12:04,694 --> 00:12:08,894
[giggles]
One lick of my special homemade
ice cream will make even the
slightest sensation of heat

178
00:12:08,927 --> 00:12:11,760
completely unbearable for
these people.

179
00:12:11,794 --> 00:12:14,227
(Niphas)
And those who can't
stand the heat will
come back for more.

180
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:17,360
(Niphas)
This site will be
totally contaminated
with Dark Power...

181
00:12:17,394 --> 00:12:21,394
(Berthier)
...Which will make it
impossible to put a new
barrier here in the future.

182
00:12:21,427 --> 00:12:22,927
(Niphas)
A flawless
plan, master.

183
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:26,927
[chuckles]
Of course
it is.

184
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,194
Who's there!

185
00:12:28,227 --> 00:12:28,927
[Meow]

186
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:32,427
Oh, it's a kitty.
Can I pet you?

187
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,594
Hmm.

188
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:35,360
Oh Niphas...

189
00:12:35,394 --> 00:12:36,627
Right!

190
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,394
[sceam]

191
00:12:38,427 --> 00:12:42,894
[giggles]

192
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,294
Sleep tight,
kitty.

193
00:12:54,960 --> 00:13:04,460
On kili kili ha-la ha-da ru-tsu
sa-daka on kili kili ha-daka on
kili kili ha-la ha-da ru-tsu sa-
daka on

194
00:13:04,494 --> 00:13:06,860
[gasp]

195
00:13:06,894 --> 00:13:12,194
It's no good! No matter
how hard I try, I can't
find any trace of Artemis
at all!

196
00:13:12,227 --> 00:13:13,027
Oh, no!

197
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:15,727
This is serious.
He never wanders
off.

198
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:21,694
Maybe the enemy has him.
Tell Ami to track his
whereabouts with her
computer and.. oh.

199
00:13:21,727 --> 00:13:22,694
Usagi!

200
00:13:22,727 --> 00:13:23,927
I know.

201
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:26,894
We can't distract Ami
now that she's made
up her mind to go.

202
00:13:26,927 --> 00:13:30,294
So we'll just have to
figure out a way to
find him ourselves.

203
00:13:30,327 --> 00:13:31,894
So let's get
to work.

204
00:13:31,927 --> 00:13:33,594
Mm-hm.

205
00:13:37,894 --> 00:13:41,794
So today's the day.
You're really going
to Germany, huh?

206
00:13:41,827 --> 00:13:42,927
Yes.

207
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,727
Thank you for helping
me study better.
I learned a lot.

208
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:49,727
Good luck over there.
I know you'll do great.
Ami?

209
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:54,594
Thank you, do something
for me Chibi-Usa. Jus
try to get along with
everybody.

210
00:13:54,627 --> 00:13:56,027
Sure.

211
00:13:56,060 --> 00:14:00,627
Well, now I know that Ami
doesn't have the Silver
Crystal. So who does?

212
00:14:05,394 --> 00:14:10,894
Minako, you should start
getting ready. It's almost
time to see Ami off.

213
00:14:10,927 --> 00:14:11,894
Yeah.
Right.

214
00:14:11,927 --> 00:14:13,427
What's wrong?

215
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:17,794
(Luna)
Oh Isn't that the ice
cream shop that Artemis
said looked suspicious?

216
00:14:17,827 --> 00:14:19,594
Yes.

217
00:14:27,727 --> 00:14:29,360
(Berthier)
Yoo-hoo!

218
00:14:29,394 --> 00:14:32,927
Ah, Master Berthier,
your plan is going
very smoothly.

219
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,527
That's good, but haven't
you forgotten to do
something?

220
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:39,260
Like dispose of those
frozen people that
you've placed in the
back storage room?

221
00:14:39,294 --> 00:14:41,560
(Niphas)
[gasp]
Oh, you're right!
I'm so sorry!

222
00:14:41,594 --> 00:14:46,294
I hope your sloppiness
doesn't persist, otherwise,
I'll have to get rid of you.

223
00:14:46,327 --> 00:14:49,160
It won't. I'll tend
to them immediately.

224
00:14:49,194 --> 00:14:54,427
All right. But just know,
if you're overwhelmed,
I can make arrangements
to relieve you.

225
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,794
That won't be necessary.
I can handle this.

226
00:14:56,827 --> 00:14:59,127
I'm counting
on you.

227
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:04,427
Who's there?!

228
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:07,160
Seems my suspicions
were correct.

229
00:15:07,194 --> 00:15:10,294
Who are you and what
are you gonna do with
all these frozen people?

230
00:15:10,327 --> 00:15:13,527
[chuckles]
Well then since
you've found them..

231
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:16,460
...you won't ever be
allowed to leave this
place alive!

232
00:15:16,494 --> 00:15:17,594
[transforming groan]

233
00:15:17,627 --> 00:15:20,560
Niphas!

234
00:15:20,594 --> 00:15:21,527
[exhaling]

235
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,127
[scream]

236
00:15:23,727 --> 00:15:25,794
Luna!

237
00:15:25,827 --> 00:15:27,260
[grunt]

238
00:15:29,427 --> 00:15:32,160
(Usagi)
[groan]
That was like the eighth
bus we had to skip.

239
00:15:32,194 --> 00:15:33,727
What's taking
Minako so long?

240
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,827
I'm getting a
bad feeling...

241
00:15:37,427 --> 00:15:38,827
I need
help, girls!

242
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:41,627
A monster has appeared
at the Bob-Floy ice-cream
shop!

243
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:42,994
Let's go.
C'mon!

244
00:15:43,027 --> 00:15:46,927
Yeah, but what about Ami?
We wanted to give her this
going-away gift.

245
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,927
I can take care
of that for you.

246
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,060
Chibi-Usa?!

247
00:15:50,094 --> 00:15:53,194
I'll go out to the
airport and make
sure she get's it.

248
00:15:53,227 --> 00:15:55,194
That's great.
Huh?

249
00:15:55,227 --> 00:15:57,560
I'll drive you out
there Chibi-Usa.

250
00:15:57,594 --> 00:15:58,794
M--Mamo?

251
00:15:58,827 --> 00:16:00,894
Get in,
let's go.

252
00:16:00,927 --> 00:16:03,294
Uh-huh.

253
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,360
We'd better
hurry up!

254
00:16:08,394 --> 00:16:09,927
Hm.

255
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:14,394
(Niphas)
Where did
that girl go?

256
00:16:14,427 --> 00:16:15,560
There!

257
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,427
[chuckles]

258
00:16:20,627 --> 00:16:21,160
[gasp]

259
00:16:21,194 --> 00:16:22,760
(Usagi)
Hey over here!

260
00:16:22,794 --> 00:16:24,194
[grunt]

261
00:16:29,794 --> 00:16:33,660
How dare you use ice cream,
in your evil plans, it's a
treat that girls love!

262
00:16:33,694 --> 00:16:36,827
But we're here to make
sure that you don't get
away with that any longer!

263
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:42,260
Now in the name
of the moon.
I'll punish you!

264
00:16:44,894 --> 00:16:46,494
Damn brats!

265
00:16:46,527 --> 00:16:48,594
[exhaling icy-snow]

266
00:17:16,794 --> 00:17:18,527
It's freezing!

267
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:21,727
This is ridiculous,
it's even colder
than the Arctic!

268
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,294
We've gotta
do something!

269
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:31,660
(Chibi-Usa)
Ami!

270
00:17:31,694 --> 00:17:33,294
(Ami)
Chibi-Usa, Mamoru.

271
00:17:33,327 --> 00:17:34,427
[giggles]

272
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:37,160
Luna P!
Transform!

273
00:17:39,594 --> 00:17:41,194
This is for you.

274
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:43,627
Thank you.

275
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:45,627
This one is
from your friends.

276
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:49,627
Usagi and
the others?

277
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:53,394
(Ami)
They didn't
have to do
this.

278
00:17:53,427 --> 00:17:58,494
Is getting a going-away
gift from your friends
how you measure your
friendship?

279
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:00,394
Huh?!

280
00:18:04,427 --> 00:18:06,160
I hope that's
not true.

281
00:18:06,194 --> 00:18:08,494
I can't believe
they're not here
to say goodbye.

282
00:18:08,527 --> 00:18:11,627
But I told them
I didn't want them
to come.

283
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:16,194
Does that really even matter?
I can't believe you call those
girls your friends.

284
00:18:16,227 --> 00:18:20,260
Usagi and the others
are wonderful friends.

285
00:18:20,294 --> 00:18:21,660
That's just
a lie.

286
00:18:25,294 --> 00:18:31,860
They don't care about you.
All they care about is
themselves. Trust me,
I know.

287
00:18:33,927 --> 00:18:37,594
(Ami)
I'm sure there's a
good reason for them
not being here.

288
00:18:44,527 --> 00:18:50,827
Something..
important.
[gasp]

289
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:56,427
Oh no.
It can't be!

290
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:59,127
It's not good,
it is?

291
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:07,827
Chibi-Usa, you're
so right about
friendship.

292
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:12,394
I was so busy thinking
about myself and forgot
what's really important.

293
00:19:12,427 --> 00:19:14,660
Mamoru, I need
a favor from you.

294
00:19:14,694 --> 00:19:18,527
I can't move.
I'm too cold to
use my powers.

295
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,294
She's gonna
wipe us out.

296
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:33,294
[fearful gasp]

297
00:19:33,327 --> 00:19:37,227
(Niphas)
Well, well..
what are you
going to do now?

298
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,327
There's no escape.

299
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:44,594
[fearful groan]

300
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:54,494
It's over!
[exhaling icy-snow]

301
00:19:54,527 --> 00:20:00,760
[screams]

302
00:20:00,794 --> 00:20:06,460
I know exactly what to do.
After all, I'm one of the
Sailor Guardians!

303
00:20:06,494 --> 00:20:09,427
I'm Sailor Mercury!

304
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:21,594
Mercury Star Power
Make Up!

305
00:20:34,294 --> 00:20:35,594
(Niphas)
[evil laughing]

306
00:20:35,627 --> 00:20:37,360
Hold it
right there!

307
00:20:37,394 --> 00:20:38,160
Hm?

308
00:20:40,327 --> 00:20:42,394
Sailor Mercury!

309
00:20:46,394 --> 00:20:50,394
Shine Aqua llusion!

310
00:20:50,427 --> 00:20:53,627
[pained scream]

311
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,227
I can't believe
you're here?

312
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:56,794
Now's your chance
Sailor Moon!

313
00:20:56,827 --> 00:20:57,727
[chuckles]

314
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,394
Hm!

315
00:21:17,594 --> 00:21:26,827
Moon Princess
Halation!

316
00:21:29,194 --> 00:21:34,394
[pained scream]

317
00:21:40,827 --> 00:21:42,194
[groans]

318
00:21:42,227 --> 00:21:43,827
[groans]
Luna!

319
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:44,927
You're okay!

320
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,427
Mercury!
Thank you!
You saved us.
You came back!

321
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:48,760
How come?

322
00:21:48,794 --> 00:21:52,127
Friendship is just
way more important.

323
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:58,560
[chuckles]

324
00:21:58,594 --> 00:22:01,427
[giggles]

325
00:22:03,494 --> 00:22:06,860
It's thanks to me that
the girls are going to
stay together, right?

326
00:22:06,894 --> 00:22:07,727
Sure.

327
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,860
[chuckles]

328
00:22:10,894 --> 00:22:14,260
(Usagi)
Ami are you sure you
won't regret not going
to Germany?

329
00:22:14,294 --> 00:22:17,494
It doesn't matter
where I take my
required courses.

330
00:22:17,527 --> 00:22:21,727
If I study hard, I'll learn
all I need to know to become
a great doctor right here.

331
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,694
I'm sure that won't
be a problem for you.

332
00:22:23,727 --> 00:22:26,194
But it would be mission
impossible for you!

333
00:22:26,227 --> 00:22:26,694
Luna!

334
00:22:26,727 --> 00:22:31,993
[laughing]

335
00:24:10,931 --> 00:24:14,631
(Usagi)
Oh boy! I'm getting
a lot done! How's
it going for you Rei?!

336
00:24:14,664 --> 00:24:17,064
(Rei)
Keep it down,
you're giving
me a headache.

337
00:24:17,097 --> 00:24:19,464
(Usagi)
Wow, you're in a
really bad mood.
What happened?

338
00:24:19,497 --> 00:24:23,631
(Rei)
My girl crazy grandpa, that's
what! I mean, just look at
this! It's unbelievable.

339
00:24:23,664 --> 00:24:27,397
(Usagi)
Huh? Whoa! Why is he
dressed in an aerobics
outfit with knee pads?!

340
00:24:27,431 --> 00:24:29,231
(Rei)
Oh, I'm so
embarrassed!

341
00:24:29,264 --> 00:24:34,131
Next time on Sailor Moon R:
"Women Must Be Strong and
Beautiful: Rei's New Special
Technique."

342
00:24:34,164 --> 00:24:36,726
The moonlight is a
messenger of love.
