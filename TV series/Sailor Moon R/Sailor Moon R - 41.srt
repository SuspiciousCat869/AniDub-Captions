1
00:01:57,658 --> 00:02:03,574
Saphir lost his life
trying to tell his brother
Demande the truth behind
Wiseman's betrayal.

2
00:02:03,741 --> 00:02:07,251
And now, Demande
is about to share
the same fate!

3
00:02:07,351 --> 00:02:10,694
Wiseman, you are
nothing but pure
evil!

4
00:02:10,827 --> 00:02:15,875
To protect love and
justice, in the name of
the moon, i'll punish you!

5
00:02:21,925 --> 00:02:27,807
Believing in Love
and the Future: Usagi's
Decision.

6
00:02:35,495 --> 00:02:36,933
[heavy panting]

7
00:02:38,737 --> 00:02:41,745
Sailor Moon, you and
the Sailor Guardians
must fallback to prepare
for the battle to come.

8
00:02:41,846 --> 00:02:45,556
I'll stay here and
try to learn more
about our enemy's plans.

9
00:02:46,826 --> 00:02:48,799
[heavy panting]

10
00:02:49,835 --> 00:02:52,275
Okay, but please
be careful.

11
00:02:56,988 --> 00:03:00,565
Alright everyone,
let's regroup
tomorrow at Hikawa
Shrine.

12
00:03:00,665 --> 00:03:04,809
The Malefic Black
Crystal's growing so
fast. I have to hurry!

13
00:03:04,876 --> 00:03:06,013
Usagi?

14
00:03:06,347 --> 00:03:08,553
[soft gasp]
Oh, hi Naru.

15
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:10,658
What is it?
Is something
wrong?

16
00:03:10,692 --> 00:03:13,667
[puzzled gasp]
Lately you've been
acting strange.

17
00:03:13,801 --> 00:03:18,347
Could it have something
to do with that bizarre
phenomenon going
on over there?

18
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:19,885
[surprised gasp]

19
00:03:21,088 --> 00:03:23,694
I knew it! You
totally know what
that's all about,
don't you?

20
00:03:23,761 --> 00:03:27,739
Usagi, if there's
anything I can do to
help out, just ask.

21
00:03:28,575 --> 00:03:29,878
Naru, I...

22
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:35,962
[small chuckle]
Oh come on, Naru!
What makes you think
that I'd know anything?

23
00:03:38,569 --> 00:03:42,948
Of course you wouldn't!
And you wouldn't be
able to talk about
it even if you did.

24
00:03:43,649 --> 00:03:45,054
Huh?
What was that?

25
00:03:46,057 --> 00:03:46,992
Usagi...

26
00:03:47,059 --> 00:03:47,895
[confused reaction]

27
00:03:49,398 --> 00:03:52,708
Please just try to
be careful. I'll see
you at school tomorrow,
okay?

28
00:03:53,677 --> 00:03:55,917
Thanks, Naru.
See you then.

29
00:03:58,658 --> 00:04:00,596
Don't be late
again, ya hear?!

30
00:04:05,042 --> 00:04:10,624
[concerned sigh]
Please God, I really
need you to hear
my prayer right now.

31
00:04:10,691 --> 00:04:14,134
Help Usagi,
and please protect
our world.

32
00:04:14,835 --> 00:04:18,111
I'm sorry Naru,
for not being able
to tell you the truth.

33
00:04:18,646 --> 00:04:22,724
But i'll do
everything I can
to protect the Earth,
I promise.

34
00:04:31,716 --> 00:04:34,657
The time has come.

35
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:38,801
Wiseman, you
have a lot of nerve
coming here after
ignoring my orders.

36
00:04:38,969 --> 00:04:41,777
Not to mention
killing Saphir for
no reason at all!

37
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:45,721
We have toiled for
years to be able to
rewrite Earth's history.

38
00:04:45,788 --> 00:04:51,570
Those not true to our
vision...Those who betray
our ideals, must
be cast off!

39
00:04:52,907 --> 00:04:55,848
What made you
think you had the
right to kill him?

40
00:04:56,718 --> 00:05:01,564
Gaze upon the beauty
of this magnificent
Malefic Black Crystal.

41
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:08,183
Now that the crystal
has been nurtured and
further strengthened by
Black Lady's dark power.

42
00:05:08,283 --> 00:05:14,935
We have the opportunity
to fulfill our long held
dream of taking revenge
upon the Earth and its people.

43
00:05:15,068 --> 00:05:17,876
For their
transgressions
against us.

44
00:05:18,812 --> 00:05:21,820
Our long
held dream...

45
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:25,731
Wiseman!
Your words will
not distract me.

46
00:05:25,831 --> 00:05:29,942
Why did you
defy my orders
and kill Saphir?
I need an answer now!

47
00:05:30,077 --> 00:05:35,793
Saphir's passing was
a minor occurence
compared to the great
things about to come.

48
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:39,134
So are those
your true
feelings?

49
00:05:39,702 --> 00:05:41,675
Prince Demande...

50
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:46,021
..Have you forgotten why
our Black Moon Clan was
forced to come to planet
Nemesis in the first place?

51
00:05:46,722 --> 00:05:51,235
For ages we have hoped
for this unique set of
circumstances to present
themselves.

52
00:05:51,703 --> 00:05:55,814
You're not seriously
thinking of allowing this
this chance at revenge to
slip away..

53
00:05:55,848 --> 00:05:58,755
..because of
an inconsequential
casualty?

54
00:05:58,789 --> 00:06:04,806
You're right. Occupying
Earth and finally getting
our vengeance has been our
clan's dream for a long time.

55
00:06:05,206 --> 00:06:08,249
So go ahead
and proceed
with our plans.

56
00:06:08,315 --> 00:06:13,831
But do not think
I have forgotten, or that
I have forgiven you for
what you have done.

57
00:06:13,898 --> 00:06:18,175
Once we have crushed
the Earth completely
I intend to re-examine
your actions.

58
00:06:18,777 --> 00:06:20,215
Consider yourself
warned.

59
00:06:20,315 --> 00:06:22,721
Of course,
as you wish.

60
00:06:22,989 --> 00:06:28,672
You are free to carry
out any investigation...
If you are still alive,
my prince.

61
00:06:28,738 --> 00:06:31,947
[evil chuckling]

62
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:41,741
The Malefic Black
Crystal's evil energy
continues to
get stronger!

63
00:06:41,808 --> 00:06:43,144
Yeah, if this
keeps up...

64
00:06:43,244 --> 00:06:44,916
It'll destroy
us all.

65
00:06:44,983 --> 00:06:46,855
We need to
do something,
quick.

66
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:51,701
I'm also worried about
Tuxedo Mask. After all,
he's still inside of
that thing!

67
00:06:51,768 --> 00:06:54,242
The only way to
help out is for
us to go in there.

68
00:06:54,342 --> 00:06:55,947
[agreeeing reaction]

69
00:06:56,114 --> 00:06:59,857
[painful screaming]

70
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:01,929
Luna! Oh no...

71
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:02,832
Artemis...

72
00:07:02,866 --> 00:07:04,971
We just have
to get past
that barrier!

73
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:07,210
I bet if we
transform
we can do it!

74
00:07:08,047 --> 00:07:09,918
Kay, let's
do it!

75
00:07:10,386 --> 00:07:12,124
Moon Crystal Power!

76
00:07:12,224 --> 00:07:13,762
Wait!
[surprised reactions]

77
00:07:13,796 --> 00:07:15,802
What?

78
00:07:17,405 --> 00:07:22,119
I just wanna say
thanks, and that I was
really looking forward to
going out for cakes again.

79
00:07:27,165 --> 00:07:33,216
I'm sorry girls...I don't
mean to be pessimistic
but I had to tell you,
just in case.

80
00:07:33,316 --> 00:07:34,185
[soft nervous giggle]

81
00:07:34,285 --> 00:07:35,790
Ami...

82
00:07:37,127 --> 00:07:40,803
Oh, come on now!
We'll be scarfing down
cakes again before
you know it!

83
00:07:40,971 --> 00:07:43,812
How about we get
the all-you-can-eat
deal the next time?

84
00:07:43,912 --> 00:07:44,447
[excited giggle]

85
00:07:44,514 --> 00:07:47,221
Last time,
you did eat
it all.

86
00:07:47,288 --> 00:07:49,226
Hey, I didn't
eat that much!

87
00:07:49,326 --> 00:07:50,564
[soft giggle]

88
00:07:51,801 --> 00:07:54,542
Okay! First we
protect the Earth,
then we celebrate.

89
00:07:54,809 --> 00:07:57,583
Let's go
do this!
For our
future!

90
00:07:57,951 --> 00:08:02,998
We'll do our best to
save Chibi-Usa and
the people of the future
city of Crystal Tokyo!

91
00:08:04,368 --> 00:08:06,875
Let's all
put our hearts
together...

92
00:08:07,043 --> 00:08:10,586
...To protect
our beloved
Earth!
[soft giggle]

93
00:08:11,087 --> 00:08:12,123
Right!

94
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:14,062
Please, be
careful everyone!

95
00:08:14,128 --> 00:08:15,298
We're counting
on you.

96
00:08:15,398 --> 00:08:17,906
Okay! Time
to transform!

97
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:22,017
Moon Crystal Power!

98
00:08:27,365 --> 00:08:31,242
Mercury Star Power!

99
00:08:32,947 --> 00:08:38,329
Mars Star Power!

100
00:08:38,897 --> 00:08:42,373
Jupiter Star Power!

101
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:49,159
Venus Star Power!

102
00:08:50,629 --> 00:08:54,072
Make Up!

103
00:09:58,182 --> 00:09:59,185
Let's go!

104
00:09:59,252 --> 00:10:02,728
[heavy panting]

105
00:10:03,029 --> 00:10:04,332
[surprised reaction]

106
00:10:04,366 --> 00:10:06,037
[painful screaming]

107
00:10:06,037 --> 00:10:07,708
Sailor Moon!

108
00:10:08,042 --> 00:10:08,484
Oh no!

109
00:10:08,544 --> 00:10:10,048
Are you alright?

110
00:10:11,285 --> 00:10:14,427
[painful gasp]
Don't worry,
I'm fine.

111
00:10:14,527 --> 00:10:17,100
Come on!
One more
time!

112
00:10:17,202 --> 00:10:18,672
Let's do it!

113
00:10:21,313 --> 00:10:23,752
[painful reaction]

114
00:10:24,354 --> 00:10:26,159
Sailor Moon,
stay strong!

115
00:10:26,226 --> 00:10:28,733
We've gotta
get inside there
and find Chibi-Usa!

116
00:10:28,866 --> 00:10:30,738
We can't let
this barrier
stop us!

117
00:10:30,805 --> 00:10:34,515
You're the only
one who can save
Chibi-Usa, Sailor
Moon. Don't give in!

118
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:38,360
We're coming
for you, Chibi-Usa!

119
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:39,195
[wince of pain]

120
00:10:40,298 --> 00:10:41,802
I'll turn you
back into the
cute girl you
once were!

121
00:10:42,103 --> 00:10:45,145
And put an end
to this evil energy
forever!

122
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:48,220
Please everyone!
Give me your
strength!

123
00:10:48,287 --> 00:10:51,763
Mercury Star Power!

124
00:10:51,796 --> 00:10:55,239
Mars Star Power!

125
00:10:55,273 --> 00:10:58,515
Jupiter Star Power!

126
00:10:58,548 --> 00:11:04,197
Venus Star Power!

127
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:08,843
Moon Crystal Power!

128
00:11:16,398 --> 00:11:17,835
Think they'll
be okay?

129
00:11:19,439 --> 00:11:28,966
I'm sure they're gonna
come back to us in one
piece, Luna. They'll
be alright.

130
00:11:29,199 --> 00:11:31,205
It looks like
we've made
it inside.

131
00:11:31,272 --> 00:11:33,378
This place is
like a maze of
mirrors.

132
00:11:33,478 --> 00:11:35,283
Well let's
get moving.

133
00:11:35,483 --> 00:11:37,991
Wait, Sailor Moon!
We really should
be cautious!

134
00:11:38,626 --> 00:11:41,867
[startled scream]
Sailor Moon!

135
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:43,572
[panting]

136
00:11:44,275 --> 00:11:45,344
She disappeared.

137
00:11:45,511 --> 00:11:46,815
Where do
you think
she'll end up?

138
00:11:46,981 --> 00:11:48,486
We'd better
go find her!

139
00:11:49,924 --> 00:11:51,795
[startled gasp]

140
00:11:51,895 --> 00:11:52,898
Where am I?

141
00:11:52,965 --> 00:11:54,403
Sailor Moon.

142
00:11:57,511 --> 00:11:58,982
[nervous breath]

143
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:04,396
Let me welcome
you inside our
Malefic Black Crystal.

144
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:06,937
[startled gasp]
Demande!

145
00:12:07,506 --> 00:12:09,979
It's a pleasure
to see you again.

146
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:15,561
[surprised gasp]

147
00:12:15,694 --> 00:12:16,964
[soft quivering]

148
00:12:16,998 --> 00:12:22,547
How lovely...Today
both you and the
Silver Crystal
will be mine.

149
00:12:25,555 --> 00:12:30,602
[small whimpering]

150
00:12:30,903 --> 00:12:35,583
Now, Sailor Moon.
You will show your
total allegiance to
me with a kiss.

151
00:12:36,986 --> 00:12:41,465
I must give a
kiss of allegiance
to Prince Demande.

152
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:50,599
Sailor Moon, R!

153
00:13:03,526 --> 00:13:07,637
Sailor Moon, R!

154
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:14,156
Now, Sailor Moon...

155
00:13:14,489 --> 00:13:18,935
You will show your
allegiance to me, Prince
Demande, with a kiss.

156
00:13:25,052 --> 00:13:26,590
Oh, Mamo...

157
00:13:26,623 --> 00:13:31,603
You will obey me
now Sailor Moon!
Obey me and be mine!

158
00:13:31,904 --> 00:13:34,846
[soft gasp]

159
00:13:34,979 --> 00:13:39,960
Demande...You may have
found a way to me capture
me but there is no way
you'll capture my love.

160
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,498
Hmph! Your love?

161
00:13:41,564 --> 00:13:44,439
As long as I have
you I can take
your love!

162
00:13:44,506 --> 00:13:47,113
I know what you're
doing now so it
won't work anymore!

163
00:13:47,213 --> 00:13:50,021
Sailor Moon...
Look into my eye!

164
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:52,929
Demande, what you're
doing is absolutely
wrong!

165
00:13:52,996 --> 00:13:55,737
Don't you know
you can't use
tricks to win
someone's heart?

166
00:13:55,737 --> 00:13:58,143
You'll never find
true love that way!

167
00:13:58,177 --> 00:14:02,957
There is no such thing
as true or false love.
It's all about power.

168
00:14:03,124 --> 00:14:07,469
Sailor Moon, pledge
your love and
allegiance to me!

169
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:11,112
Pledge to me.

170
00:14:12,617 --> 00:14:15,123
I pledge to you.

171
00:14:16,493 --> 00:14:18,733
Sailor Moon!

172
00:14:19,168 --> 00:14:21,207
Sailor Moon!

173
00:14:22,042 --> 00:14:25,518
I'll see you
at school
tomorrow, okay?

174
00:14:28,527 --> 00:14:30,967
Be strong,
Sailor Moon.

175
00:14:31,502 --> 00:14:33,909
Right!

176
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:38,923
[shocked reaction]
Impossible! How come
my spell isn't
working on you?!

177
00:14:39,524 --> 00:14:41,062
Stop this foolishness!

178
00:14:41,129 --> 00:14:44,672
Power alone never
solves anything!
Can't you see that?

179
00:14:44,772 --> 00:14:47,546
Our power will
destroy all
humanity on
Earth.

180
00:14:47,646 --> 00:14:49,284
Otherwise we
will have
no future!

181
00:14:49,318 --> 00:14:52,125
Why would you use
your power only
for destruction?

182
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:55,133
Wouldn't it be
better if we could
all live together
in peace?

183
00:14:55,167 --> 00:14:57,774
But you are the
ones who shunned
us first.

184
00:14:57,808 --> 00:15:01,017
Your people could
never coexist with
the Black Moon Clan!

185
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:02,855
That isn't true!

186
00:15:02,888 --> 00:15:07,301
The Four Spectre Sisters
were able to find a way,
and are now living happily
right here on Earth!

187
00:15:07,334 --> 00:15:11,145
But Wiseman said...
[gasp of realization]

188
00:15:11,178 --> 00:15:14,988
I wonder...
Could it be Wiseman
was lying to us?

189
00:15:15,256 --> 00:15:16,359
[agreeing reaction]

190
00:15:17,796 --> 00:15:19,300
That was probably
the real reason
Wiseman killed your
brother.

191
00:15:20,637 --> 00:15:24,681
Saphir was trying
to warn you about
Wiseman's betrayal.

192
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:27,657
[groan]
Listen to me...
Wiseman is...

193
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:30,632
[gasp]
Wiseman is...

194
00:15:30,665 --> 00:15:34,108
I just can't
believe this, but...

195
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:40,292
Those eyes of yours,
they can only belong
to someone who tells
the truth.

196
00:15:40,292 --> 00:15:44,236
Sailor Moon...

197
00:15:44,269 --> 00:15:46,041
Prince Demande.

198
00:15:46,108 --> 00:15:47,377
Wiseman!

199
00:15:48,915 --> 00:15:52,191
Sailor Moon is
in our way. She's
keeping us from
achieving our goals.

200
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:54,130
She must be
disposed of!

201
00:15:54,196 --> 00:15:56,136
I don't take
orders from you!

202
00:15:56,202 --> 00:15:57,071
Stay out of
this!

203
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:01,416
I have no use for
a fool who believes
the words of
some silly girl.

204
00:16:01,718 --> 00:16:03,021
What's that?!

205
00:16:03,188 --> 00:16:06,096
I have Black
Lady to do my
bidding now.

206
00:16:06,196 --> 00:16:09,172
And the dark
power is growing
with every moment!

207
00:16:09,205 --> 00:16:11,444
You're no
longer needed.

208
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:14,151
Be gone!

209
00:16:16,859 --> 00:16:18,697
Finally I see
your true colors!

210
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:24,346
If you think you can
kill the leader of the
Black Moon Clan so easily..
Give it your best shot!

211
00:16:24,413 --> 00:16:26,084
[grunt]

212
00:16:31,065 --> 00:16:34,441
Destroying the Earth
and turning it into a
dark world...

213
00:16:34,474 --> 00:16:39,288
That is what the
Ruler of Darkness,
Death Phantom, desires!

214
00:16:39,889 --> 00:16:41,527
Death Phantom?

215
00:16:41,894 --> 00:16:43,766
Turning the Earth
into a dark world?

216
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,739
Is that what you
intend?
[evil laughter]

217
00:16:45,739 --> 00:16:49,015
I won't let
you do it!

218
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:50,786
Sailor Moon...

219
00:16:50,819 --> 00:16:51,254
[fearful gasp]

220
00:16:51,254 --> 00:16:53,393
You must die
as well!

221
00:16:53,426 --> 00:16:55,165
[cry of fear]

222
00:16:58,206 --> 00:17:02,117
[evil laughter]

223
00:17:02,318 --> 00:17:03,822
Demande!

224
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:06,195
[grunts of pain]

225
00:17:06,262 --> 00:17:08,936
So you still have
enough strength
to stand?

226
00:17:08,936 --> 00:17:12,245
Then you will die
with Sailor Moon!

227
00:17:12,279 --> 00:17:16,858
Don't underestimate
me!
[outburst]

228
00:17:17,393 --> 00:17:22,841
[painful screaming]

229
00:17:29,493 --> 00:17:32,099
[painful groans]

230
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,105
Demande!
Hold on!

231
00:17:34,305 --> 00:17:35,442
Sailor Moon...

232
00:17:35,509 --> 00:17:38,618
It appears..I was
wrong about some things.

233
00:17:38,885 --> 00:17:42,930
I truly believed
moving our clan to Earth
was the only way
forward.

234
00:17:42,963 --> 00:17:46,640
And I was willing
to give me life, to
make that happen.

235
00:17:46,873 --> 00:17:51,854
I became so totally
obsessed with my
mission, I couldn't see
through Wiseman's deception.

236
00:17:51,954 --> 00:17:55,397
So I allowed
countless lives
to be sacrificed.

237
00:17:55,631 --> 00:17:59,442
I guess I've simply
forgotten what it
means to be human.

238
00:17:59,542 --> 00:18:03,285
You haven't forgotten.
After all you just
saved my life.

239
00:18:06,328 --> 00:18:09,603
Now that you know what
the truth is, you won't
make those mistakes again.

240
00:18:09,904 --> 00:18:13,447
You're right.
But it's too
late for me.

241
00:18:13,614 --> 00:18:15,118
Don't say that!

242
00:18:15,151 --> 00:18:19,531
I'm glad to hear the
Spectre Sisters are
living so happily
on Earth.

243
00:18:19,564 --> 00:18:22,705
And the fact that
you and your friends
tried to save Saphir...

244
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:27,586
Makes me think we
might actually
have been able
to all live in peace.

245
00:18:27,586 --> 00:18:29,057
[small breath]

246
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:31,530
We can do it!
With your help we
can make anything
happen!

247
00:18:31,564 --> 00:18:37,446
[touched exhale]
These tears of
sadness, are
for me?

248
00:18:37,479 --> 00:18:40,622
You are the ones
who will create
the future.

249
00:18:40,722 --> 00:18:43,530
Please promise
to look after
my people..

250
00:18:43,563 --> 00:18:47,174
The Black Moon Clan
back on planet Nemesis.

251
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,346
[quiet sob]

252
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:52,153
I thank you...

253
00:18:52,388 --> 00:18:56,265
Sailor Moon,
I love...

254
00:18:56,466 --> 00:18:59,307
Demande!
Prince Demande!

255
00:19:01,446 --> 00:19:02,348
Huh?

256
00:19:02,382 --> 00:19:04,521
[painful yelp]

257
00:19:04,554 --> 00:19:08,699
The Legendary Silver
Crystal that possesses
the power to change
the world!

258
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:09,702
Give it to me!

259
00:19:09,735 --> 00:19:12,008
But I saw you die!

260
00:19:12,042 --> 00:19:14,248
I am an
immortal being.

261
00:19:14,281 --> 00:19:18,259
I would rather die,
than give you the
Crystal!

262
00:19:18,593 --> 00:19:20,733
You will hand
it over to me!

263
00:19:21,033 --> 00:19:23,674
Tuxedo Mask, help!

264
00:19:24,342 --> 00:19:25,579
[evil snickering]

265
00:19:26,749 --> 00:19:30,426
Help? Would you
care to see where your
Tuxedo Mask is now?

266
00:19:30,526 --> 00:19:35,239
Your precious Tuxedo Mask,
also known as Mamoru Chiba,
and Chibi-Usa, or should I say
Black Lady...

267
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:40,621
Have fallen in love.

268
00:19:41,389 --> 00:19:43,462
You've been abandoned.

269
00:19:43,763 --> 00:19:46,303
They have forgotten
you.

270
00:19:46,704 --> 00:19:48,710
[soft crying]

271
00:19:48,777 --> 00:19:51,584
[sinister laughter]

272
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:55,695
You're lying.

273
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:00,609
Wiseman, I know all about
your illusions and
I won't fall for your
tricks!

274
00:20:00,676 --> 00:20:03,551
This isn't a lie.

275
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:06,425
[evil chuckling]

276
00:20:06,525 --> 00:20:10,670
In this world,
there is nothing that
you can truly trust.

277
00:20:10,703 --> 00:20:15,249
You must loathe
everyone and everything,
Sailor Moon!

278
00:20:15,317 --> 00:20:20,464
Go on, instill
the Legendary Silver
Crystal with the
power of hatred!

279
00:20:20,497 --> 00:20:24,341
Destroy this world!
Turn it into
eternal darkness!

280
00:20:24,675 --> 00:20:28,720
It's not true...
Mamo and Chibi-Usa
would never betray me.

281
00:20:28,753 --> 00:20:29,856
[evil laughter]

282
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:32,464
How could they?!

283
00:20:32,497 --> 00:20:34,569
Answer me,
Chibi-Usa!

284
00:20:34,703 --> 00:20:38,748
Please help me
Sailor Moon!
You must believe
in me!

285
00:20:39,851 --> 00:20:43,694
Chibi-Usa...

286
00:20:43,728 --> 00:20:46,569
Wait, why aren't
you under my spell?!

287
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:49,678
Chibi-Usa and Mamo
are very dear people
to me.

288
00:20:49,711 --> 00:20:51,784
I know that they
would never betray me!

289
00:20:51,817 --> 00:20:55,560
Well, in that
case...die!

290
00:20:55,593 --> 00:20:56,463
[fearful gasp]

291
00:21:02,446 --> 00:21:08,496
Using evil lies to
toy with the heart of a
pure, young innocent girl
is the work of a true coward.

292
00:21:08,596 --> 00:21:11,939
I Tuxedo Mask,
will never...
forgive you!

293
00:21:12,207 --> 00:21:13,878
Tuxedo Mask,
you're here!

294
00:21:13,911 --> 00:21:15,683
Don't forget about us!

295
00:21:15,716 --> 00:21:17,388
Sailor Mars!

296
00:21:17,421 --> 00:21:18,691
Sailor Jupiter!

297
00:21:18,724 --> 00:21:19,961
Sailor Mercury!

298
00:21:19,994 --> 00:21:22,835
Sailor Venus!

299
00:21:22,869 --> 00:21:25,410
The Guardians
have arrived!

300
00:21:25,443 --> 00:21:26,780
[sinister chuckling]

301
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,322
You are too late,
the time has come!

302
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:33,800
Black Lady's
dark power has
reached its full
force!

303
00:21:34,468 --> 00:21:38,679
The Malefic Black
Crystal's Power,
has now opened
the Dark Gate!

304
00:21:38,679 --> 00:21:40,885
That will turn
your world to dust!

305
00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:42,958
We won't let
that happen!

306
00:21:42,958 --> 00:21:47,637
Watch as the entire
Earth plunges into
darkness forever!

307
00:21:47,671 --> 00:21:51,648
[evil laughter]

308
00:21:51,682 --> 00:21:54,590
Guardians, I have
discovered the
Dark Gate's very center.

309
00:21:54,623 --> 00:21:56,629
We must hurry!

310
00:21:56,662 --> 00:22:01,007
Right!

311
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,983
This is it, the Dark
Gate's center.

312
00:22:04,016 --> 00:22:07,024
Ah, the
Sailor Guardians.

313
00:22:07,057 --> 00:22:08,462
Look up there!

314
00:22:08,462 --> 00:22:09,798
It's Chibi-Usa!

315
00:22:16,684 --> 00:22:21,731
I am known as Black Lady,
messenger of the Ruler of
Darkness, Death Phantom!

316
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:24,639
This world of yours
will soon be destroyed.

317
00:22:24,762 --> 00:22:26,931
Watch as it becomes
filled with hate!

318
00:22:27,498 --> 00:22:33,638
[maniacal laughter]

319
00:24:10,535 --> 00:24:13,838
Your world will
soon become nothing
but darkness.

320
00:24:13,905 --> 00:24:17,508
Please Silver Crystal,
change Chibi-Usa back
into herself!

321
00:24:17,608 --> 00:24:21,546
The Silver Crystal is
powerless against the
Malefic Black Crystal!
Die!

322
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,848
No, I won't
give up!

323
00:24:23,881 --> 00:24:27,919
I will find a way to
save you Chibi-Usa,
and all my friends!

324
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:33,624
Next time on Sailor Moon R:
"The Final Battle Bettween
Light and Dark: Pledge
of Love for the Future."

325
00:24:33,624 --> 00:24:36,301
The moonlight is
a messenger of love.
