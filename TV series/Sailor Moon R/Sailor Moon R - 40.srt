1
00:01:56,650 --> 00:02:00,153
Demande, hear me
out! Saphir hasn't
betrayed you.

2
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,991
Please listen to what
he has to say about
the things he saw
in the future!

3
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,593
And what
he found out
about Wiseman!

4
00:02:06,593 --> 00:02:10,697
That man is just
using you to
accomplish his own
evil objectives.

5
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:15,535
That's right, Demande...
your real enemy
is Wiseman!

6
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:26,513
Saphir Dies. Wiseman's Trap.

7
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:34,187
The mysterious object that
suddenly appeared in the
middle of Tokyo...

8
00:02:34,587 --> 00:02:38,958
...has brought
traffic to a standstill,
and completely shut down
the Metropolitan Area.

9
00:02:39,025 --> 00:02:42,162
Those of you
living in the
surrounding vicinities
should stay away.

10
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:45,932
We are on high
alert until
authorities are able
to assess the danger.

11
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:51,704
This has become
a major disaster!

12
00:02:51,971 --> 00:02:54,040
Do we have a
plan in mind?

13
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:57,911
First we have to find
out how powerful that
giant malefic black
crystal is...

14
00:02:58,111 --> 00:03:00,980
...before we're
able to come
up with any sort
of counter measure.

15
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:05,685
So that means we'll
just have to wait and
see what Mamoru and Artemis
are able to discover.

16
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:09,589
Until then, there's
not much to do
except stand by.

17
00:03:09,956 --> 00:03:12,258
[upset quivering]

18
00:03:18,164 --> 00:03:20,533
Chibi-Usa...

19
00:03:21,467 --> 00:03:24,037
These TV reports
are getting me worried.

20
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:27,840
Perhaps we should be
thinking of evacuating
like everyone else.

21
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,576
Mom! What's that?

22
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:30,977
Huh...what?

23
00:03:31,177 --> 00:03:33,513
This...Oh.

24
00:03:33,646 --> 00:03:38,851
One, two, three, four,
five...Oh dear. I brought
out an extra cup.

25
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:40,954
Huh...A pink cup.

26
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:46,125
I wonder why I
felt I needed to
bring out this particular
cup with all of yours.

27
00:03:46,492 --> 00:03:49,028
Thanks for
the cake!

28
00:03:50,029 --> 00:03:52,865
How strange!

29
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:58,938
With Luna P gone,
memories of Chibi-Usa
should have been erased
from everyone's minds.

30
00:03:59,038 --> 00:04:02,242
Do you suppose that
deep down they still
remember her?

31
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:06,546
Luna...Do you
think it's wrong
that I actually
miss her?

32
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:07,647
Huh?

33
00:04:08,948 --> 00:04:14,053
Now that Chibi-Usa's
gone, everything's
back to the way it
should be.

34
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:17,257
There's no one
jumping on my
bed and bugging me.

35
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:20,226
But this house
feels so empty
without her.

36
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:23,529
[quiet sobs]

37
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:25,498
I know.

38
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:29,168
It's gonna be
alright, Usagi.

39
00:04:29,235 --> 00:04:30,970
But how?

40
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,975
We'll work together.
We'll find a way by
combining our powers.

41
00:04:36,075 --> 00:04:39,579
I'm sure we can remove
her evil and bring
back the girl
we love.

42
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,549
You're right...
Thank you.

43
00:04:45,084 --> 00:04:49,989
O'emptiness..O'silence..
Obey me!

44
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:53,259
Swear your allegiance
to the almighty
Death Phantom!

45
00:04:53,593 --> 00:04:58,031
The one who shall
rule the universe
is not someone
like Prince Demande...

46
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,833
...With his fleeting
dreams of power.

47
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:04,871
But someone like the
Death Phantom, who
wields absolute
power!

48
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:09,208
Ohh...foolish
Prince Demande.

49
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:14,180
You shall do my bidding
and bring on silence
and chaotic barrenness.

50
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:19,485
And then bestow this
devastation upon the true
conquerer of this world...
the Death Phantom!

51
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:25,558
Purge the universe
of all impurities,
like the living.

52
00:05:25,858 --> 00:05:28,761
So that only
emptiness prevails
everywhere!

53
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:30,229
[unpleasant grunt]

54
00:05:30,563 --> 00:05:31,764
Who's there?

55
00:05:33,032 --> 00:05:33,866
Hmph!

56
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,902
[small chuckle]

57
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:44,744
Just as I thought!
He's only been
using my brother
all along.

58
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:46,245
Curse you, Wiseman!

59
00:05:49,549 --> 00:05:53,486
[disturbed grunt]
There's been an
unnatural surge
of energy in the crystal.

60
00:05:53,586 --> 00:05:55,188
Wiseman again
I bet.

61
00:05:56,155 --> 00:05:57,824
I must stop this.

62
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:23,249
That's better. I can't let
the reactor get out
of control. It needs
to cool down.

63
00:06:23,783 --> 00:06:24,851
Saphir.
[surprised gasp]

64
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:27,120
Wiseman!

65
00:06:27,253 --> 00:06:30,189
I order you
to put that
back right now.

66
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:32,925
You cannot order
me to do
anything.

67
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:36,262
I will talk to
my brother first
and then decide
what's best.

68
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:41,834
Death Phantom, ruler
of the entire universe,
is giving you this order.

69
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:46,839
Defying Death Phantom,
will result in your
total destruction.

70
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:51,844
You've referred to
him before. Who
exactly is this
Death Phantom?

71
00:06:51,944 --> 00:06:59,485
He is a supreme God who
intends to restore glorious
silence and crystal-clear
emptiness to the universe.

72
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:04,123
In time, he will
eliminate every
one of you filthy
creatures.

73
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:06,859
Who...Who
are you really?

74
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:14,467
It is not yet time
for me to reveal
that information.

75
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:16,035
[painful reaction]

76
00:07:16,202 --> 00:07:18,771
Wiseman!
You bastard!

77
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:21,808
You shall perish
without finding
what you seek!

78
00:07:21,874 --> 00:07:23,709
[painful scream]

79
00:07:27,713 --> 00:07:29,248
He managed
to get away...

80
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:34,020
But it doesn't
matter. I know
exactly where
he's going.

81
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:39,859
[sinister giggle]

82
00:07:39,926 --> 00:07:42,962
The Dark Gate
is coming along
quite nicely.

83
00:07:43,095 --> 00:07:47,033
Very soon, the reactor
will have reached it's
peak energy output.

84
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:49,735
Then if we're
able to send
it through...

85
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:54,841
This world
will disappear.
A new history
will be written.

86
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:58,110
[chuckling in unison]

87
00:08:02,114 --> 00:08:05,685
[Citizens panicking]

88
00:08:05,751 --> 00:08:09,255
Please remain calm
and evacuate in an
orderly manner.

89
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:11,991
Should we leave?

90
00:08:12,091 --> 00:08:14,827
Well it looks
like everyone
else is.

91
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:18,197
We'd better pack
up our shop and get
out of here too.

92
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:23,603
Right. Huh?

93
00:08:25,905 --> 00:08:26,973
Is that...

94
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:29,141
What's wrong, Petz?

95
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:34,180
[stumbling painfully]

96
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:36,582
Brother!

97
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:41,988
Don't do it! This
is exactly what
Wiseman...

98
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:50,930
The smell..
of grass..
brings back memories.

99
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:56,669
Look at that!
A flower, brother!

100
00:08:56,969 --> 00:08:59,071
Yup. It's pretty.

101
00:08:59,138 --> 00:09:00,840
And unusual!

102
00:09:02,608 --> 00:09:06,913
You're right. With
the harsh environment on
Nemesis to find a flower
is almost a miracle.

103
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:11,717
However, one day
I will invade planet
earth and reclaim it
for us.

104
00:09:11,784 --> 00:09:13,953
Then you'll have
a whole garden
filled with
flowers.

105
00:09:14,086 --> 00:09:17,823
[pleased gasp]
Yeah, you'll get
our earth back. I
know you can!

106
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:19,125
I'm sure of it!

107
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:20,593
[pleased sigh]

108
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:23,763
Come...Let's go
my prince.

109
00:09:23,863 --> 00:09:26,766
[shocked gasp]
Wiseman! Stop,
now!

110
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:29,101
[gasp]
Brother, no!

111
00:09:29,168 --> 00:09:33,005
Stay away from
him! He's using you!
Don't you see that?

112
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:37,610
Brother...Brother!!

113
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:41,581
[painful gasp]

114
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:46,118
Where am I?

115
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:47,920
[soft sigh]

116
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:51,791
[relieved sigh]
I'm glad
you're awake,
Master Saphir.

117
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:53,993
Petz, is
it really you?

118
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:55,828
Yes.

119
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:57,597
Where am I?

120
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:59,732
In my home,
on earth.

121
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:06,939
That's right. I was told
that you and your sisters
decided to live in this
world after you betrayed us.

122
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:10,843
I will accept
my punishment.

123
00:10:11,577 --> 00:10:15,781
But..Please Master,
you must forgive
my three sisters.

124
00:10:15,848 --> 00:10:17,917
I take full
responsibility.

125
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:20,586
[rueful chuckle]
You have nothing
to worry about.

126
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:24,624
I didn't come
to this world
to punish you
or your sisters.

127
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,726
[surprised breath]

128
00:10:29,595 --> 00:10:32,999
Why is she tending
to him? The last I
heard she hated all men.

129
00:10:33,099 --> 00:10:35,601
We should get
out, before he
gets better!

130
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:38,504
What if..he changes
his mind and wants
to punish us!

131
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:40,072
I think we're
going to be
alright.

132
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:41,574
Huh?

133
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:45,711
Right now..let's
leave them alone
for a little while.

134
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:47,980
Do you know
something we
don't?

135
00:10:49,715 --> 00:10:54,620
The truth is..not
so long ago Petz
loved him.

136
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,956
What's that?!

137
00:10:57,123 --> 00:10:59,592
Saphir has gone mad.

138
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:04,530
He removed the control
module from the
reactor to stop it
from functioning.

139
00:11:04,897 --> 00:11:09,568
We must get it
back, and he must
be eliminated
immediately!

140
00:11:09,735 --> 00:11:14,807
He has fled from
this world, betraying us,
and all of our people.

141
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:19,712
Ridiculous! Saphir would
never do that. There must
be a reason!

142
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:23,983
So, does that mean
you would like to cancel
our long awaited plans?

143
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:24,784
Well, I-

144
00:11:26,218 --> 00:11:29,588
Nonsense. I will
take it upon myself
to retrieve the
module for the reactor.

145
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:42,468
I just can't believe
it. Why Saphir?

146
00:11:47,773 --> 00:11:50,675
Sailor Moon, R!

147
00:12:03,689 --> 00:12:06,625
Sailor Moon, R!

148
00:12:12,698 --> 00:12:13,866
Would you
like some?

149
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:16,068
Thank you.

150
00:12:16,602 --> 00:12:19,825
Something's different..
about you.

151
00:12:19,892 --> 00:12:25,831
I'm not quite sure what
it is. But I feel very
relaxed and comfortable
being with you now.

152
00:12:25,898 --> 00:12:28,434
Oh...

153
00:12:28,534 --> 00:12:31,437
I guess that's
because I'm very
content with
myself now.

154
00:12:31,537 --> 00:12:35,808
I've come to learn
true kindness and trust
from Sailor Moon and
her circle of friends.

155
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:39,579
Sailor Moon, huh?

156
00:12:39,645 --> 00:12:44,617
While it's true there are
some some difficulties
living in this world as
compared to Nemesis..

157
00:12:44,817 --> 00:12:50,756
It's filled with warmth
and joy. We're grateful
for being given the chance
to experience this.

158
00:12:50,856 --> 00:12:55,561
I like how the
people living here
truly seem to
care about one another.

159
00:12:55,661 --> 00:12:59,398
I'm finding it to
be quite a wonderful
way to live.

160
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:07,540
Is destroying this
world really the
right thing to do?

161
00:13:07,673 --> 00:13:10,576
What kind of
future are we
trying to create?

162
00:13:10,643 --> 00:13:13,079
I never questioned
our reasons for
revenge.

163
00:13:15,314 --> 00:13:19,385
But maybe that was because
Wiseman was manipulating us
into believing that it was our
only way for survival.

164
00:13:19,719 --> 00:13:22,555
[upset reaction]

165
00:13:22,655 --> 00:13:24,690
Master Saphir?

166
00:13:24,824 --> 00:13:27,360
I need to leave..now.

167
00:13:27,426 --> 00:13:28,694
[painful grunt]

168
00:13:28,761 --> 00:13:30,296
Master Saphir!

169
00:13:30,363 --> 00:13:35,534
I must see my brother
as soon as I can.

170
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:42,441
How typical of you.
Always putting Prince
Demande before
yourself.

171
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:44,377
I'm sorry. I
need to go!

172
00:13:44,443 --> 00:13:46,012
You can't leave
in this condition!

173
00:13:46,312 --> 00:13:49,448
He needs to know about
Wiseman's true
intentions right away!

174
00:13:49,515 --> 00:13:51,317
[gasp]
No!

175
00:13:51,751 --> 00:13:52,818
But Petz...

176
00:13:52,885 --> 00:13:55,688
I get it now,
I know who
hurt you.

177
00:13:55,755 --> 00:14:01,794
If you go to Prince
Demande in this condition
you won't have the energy
to stand up to him...

178
00:14:01,861 --> 00:14:04,030
And you could...
[quiet sobs]

179
00:14:04,296 --> 00:14:05,531
Petz...

180
00:14:06,732 --> 00:14:11,637
[small sob]
If something..should
happen to you..
[quiet sob]

181
00:14:12,505 --> 00:14:15,408
I have go
and make him
do the right
thing.

182
00:14:15,675 --> 00:14:17,643
[scared reaction]

183
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:19,512
Put yourself
in my place.

184
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:24,784
If one of your sisters
was going down the wrong
path, would you be able to
just turn away and ignore her?

185
00:14:25,051 --> 00:14:27,019
[quivering sob]

186
00:14:27,319 --> 00:14:31,490
He's all I have.
Prince Demande and I
are all that's left
of our family.

187
00:14:31,657 --> 00:14:32,114
But-

188
00:14:33,659 --> 00:14:35,728
Don't worry. I'm just
going to talk to him.
That's all that's going
to happen.

189
00:14:35,995 --> 00:14:39,298
[quivering sob]

190
00:14:42,802 --> 00:14:46,372
When things are
settled, I'll
come back here.

191
00:14:48,374 --> 00:14:50,476
I'll wait for you.

192
00:14:50,576 --> 00:14:55,081
It will be okay
Petz, you'll see.

193
00:14:56,382 --> 00:14:58,350
[upset whimper]

194
00:14:59,418 --> 00:15:02,488
Why did Petz just
let him walk
out of here
all alone?

195
00:15:02,555 --> 00:15:04,056
He was so injured.

196
00:15:04,356 --> 00:15:06,459
Shouldn't we follow him
and be his backup?

197
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:08,961
How? We can't.
Not anymore.

198
00:15:09,295 --> 00:15:11,697
You're forgetting that
we no longer have
any powers.

199
00:15:11,797 --> 00:15:14,433
I'm afraid we'd
just get in the
way.

200
00:15:14,567 --> 00:15:18,671
All we can
do is wait..
and hope he
returns safely.

201
00:15:18,738 --> 00:15:19,772
[worried breath]

202
00:15:23,409 --> 00:15:25,711
This is Usagi.
Oh, Koan!

203
00:15:25,978 --> 00:15:28,414
Usagi, please..
help us!

204
00:15:28,614 --> 00:15:38,624
[stumbling in pain]

205
00:15:40,993 --> 00:15:42,628
[sinister laughing]

206
00:15:42,695 --> 00:15:44,396
Huh?

207
00:15:45,831 --> 00:15:49,468
How nice of you to
show up. It saves me the
trouble of having to
go look for you.

208
00:15:50,302 --> 00:15:51,670
Don't interfere,
Black Lady!

209
00:15:52,004 --> 00:15:54,473
I have
business to discuss
with my brother.

210
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:59,311
That's too bad.
Sorry to say you'll
be dead before
you see him.

211
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:01,313
[grunt]

212
00:16:01,413 --> 00:16:02,448
[shocked reaction]

213
00:16:02,581 --> 00:16:04,016
Hold it
right there!

214
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:05,584
Sailor Moon?!

215
00:16:05,651 --> 00:16:07,720
Ugh!
You're here
too?

216
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,557
Stop, Chibi-Usa!
Don't make another
move to try and
harm him!

217
00:16:11,624 --> 00:16:12,458
[surprised gasp]

218
00:16:13,659 --> 00:16:17,029
Please snap out of
it, Chibi-Usa! Wiseman
has brainwashed you!

219
00:16:17,429 --> 00:16:22,701
I don't know what you're
talking about. This is the
real me. I'm not brainwashed.

220
00:16:22,768 --> 00:16:25,404
You are! Why
can't you see it?!

221
00:16:25,471 --> 00:16:30,976
Enough!
Luna P...Transform!

222
00:16:32,912 --> 00:16:33,946
Chibi-Usa!

223
00:16:34,046 --> 00:16:34,847
[startled reaction]

224
00:16:34,947 --> 00:16:37,917
Crescent..Beam!

225
00:16:37,983 --> 00:16:39,585
Oh no
you don't!

226
00:16:40,452 --> 00:16:41,987
[painful scream]

227
00:16:42,054 --> 00:16:45,324
Bubble..Spray!

228
00:16:45,424 --> 00:16:46,592
[painful groan]

229
00:16:46,692 --> 00:16:47,960
Why are you
protecting me?

230
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:51,897
Saphir, now's your
chance. Talk to your
brother while
she's distracted.

231
00:16:51,964 --> 00:16:54,433
Wait, how did
you know about
that?

232
00:16:54,533 --> 00:16:59,872
Actually, we really
don't know the exact details.
But Koan and her sisters
asked us to help you.

233
00:16:59,972 --> 00:17:02,575
That's insane!
You could have been
walking into a trap!

234
00:17:02,908 --> 00:17:08,681
Perhaps. It's just a habit
we picked up from being
around our clumsy but
caring team leader for so long.

235
00:17:08,981 --> 00:17:12,084
We tend to trust people
sometimes, even if they're
our enemies.

236
00:17:12,351 --> 00:17:14,687
And the most
trusting of us
is Sailor Moon.

237
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:16,522
[puzzled reaction]

238
00:17:16,956 --> 00:17:19,892
You thought you could
stop me? This isn't over.

239
00:17:22,895 --> 00:17:24,797
[battle cry]

240
00:17:24,864 --> 00:17:27,366
[coughing in unison]

241
00:17:27,466 --> 00:17:30,536
Chibi-Usa! Become
your true self!

242
00:17:30,836 --> 00:17:35,341
Moon Crystal Power!

243
00:17:36,842 --> 00:17:40,079
Not falling for
that trick again!

244
00:17:40,613 --> 00:17:41,981
[fearful gasp]

245
00:17:42,615 --> 00:17:46,585
And now I'll
serve up..my power!

246
00:17:48,387 --> 00:17:50,522
Venus Love me...

247
00:17:51,423 --> 00:17:52,591
Huh?!

248
00:17:52,858 --> 00:17:55,561
[painful screaming]

249
00:17:55,661 --> 00:17:56,562
[fearful gasp]

250
00:17:57,897 --> 00:18:01,280
Don't worry about
me anymore. You'd
better hurry and
help your friends.

251
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,548
[gasp]
But-

252
00:18:02,648 --> 00:18:04,316
[painful screaming]

253
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:09,321
You were asked to get
me safely to my brother.
And you've accomplished
that.

254
00:18:15,494 --> 00:18:17,363
Now...
Go save them.

255
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:19,031
[agreeing reaction]

256
00:18:19,498 --> 00:18:21,533
Saphir...

257
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:26,372
Saphir! Why
did you
betray me?

258
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:28,374
I've done no
such thing!

259
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:32,444
Brother! Wiseman
has been deceiving
us all along!

260
00:18:32,544 --> 00:18:34,413
[loud grunt]

261
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:35,447
[painful reaction]

262
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:38,517
Stop talking
nonsense.
You're wrong.

263
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:41,420
But if anyone,
including you, dares
to interfere with-

264
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,891
Brother! Wiseman is
the one who came up with
this plan, not you!

265
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,427
He's just using you!
Try to remember!

266
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:51,530
Was this really what
you and I were wanting
to achieve?

267
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:52,932
What we were
fighting for?!

268
00:18:52,998 --> 00:18:53,933
[chuckle]

269
00:18:54,033 --> 00:18:56,302
Brother!

270
00:18:57,937 --> 00:19:00,873
I'm tired of all
this dramatic nonsense.

271
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,408
Just die.

272
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:03,442
[startled reaction]

273
00:19:07,513 --> 00:19:09,281
Not him again!

274
00:19:09,381 --> 00:19:10,316
[gasp]

275
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:11,951
Stop this,
Chibi-Usa!

276
00:19:12,051 --> 00:19:15,287
Demande! You need
to listen to Saphir.

277
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:18,357
He knows something
about the future
that you're unaware of.

278
00:19:18,424 --> 00:19:20,826
Please, listen
to what he has
to say.

279
00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:24,763
Fine then. Saphir,
I will hear you out.

280
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:26,799
Brother...

281
00:19:26,966 --> 00:19:28,867
[shocked gasp]

282
00:19:29,435 --> 00:19:32,671
[painful screaming]

283
00:19:32,805 --> 00:19:33,906
[collapsed reaction]

284
00:19:33,973 --> 00:19:34,940
Oh, no!

285
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,742
S-Saphir!

286
00:19:36,809 --> 00:19:38,944
[shocked gasp]
Wiseman!

287
00:19:40,879 --> 00:19:46,685
Saphir is a traitor. I
am just sparing you the
unpleasant task of having to
execute your own brother.

288
00:19:46,819 --> 00:19:48,487
Brother...

289
00:19:48,954 --> 00:19:50,289
[speechless reaction]

290
00:19:51,457 --> 00:19:55,828
[heavy breathing]
Wiseman, he..he wants
to erase the future.

291
00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:57,296
His goal is...

292
00:19:57,396 --> 00:19:58,464
Die!

293
00:19:58,564 --> 00:20:01,967
No, wait!
Wiseman!

294
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:05,404
[painful screaming]

295
00:20:05,471 --> 00:20:07,673
Saphir!

296
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:12,711
[defeated gasp]

297
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:14,880
Saphir!

298
00:20:18,817 --> 00:20:20,986
Foolish young man.

299
00:20:21,353 --> 00:20:26,992
He allowed himself
to be tricked into
spouting nonsense by
those Sailor Guardians.

300
00:20:28,761 --> 00:20:31,697
Come, Black Lady
and Prince Demande.

301
00:20:31,797 --> 00:20:36,301
We will settle our
score with those
young ladies
on another day.

302
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:39,338
Hmph! Fine
by me.

303
00:20:44,543 --> 00:20:47,279
Saphir...

304
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:50,682
I'm..I'm sorry
I couldn't
protect him.

305
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:54,686
[small groan]
Petz..I'm sorry.

306
00:20:54,787 --> 00:20:56,288
[shocked gasp]

307
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:02,961
Saphir! No!
You can't die!

308
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:04,396
You just can't!

309
00:21:04,463 --> 00:21:07,299
What about Petz?
You can't leave
her alone!

310
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:12,371
Saphir wake up!
[soft sobs]

311
00:21:18,343 --> 00:21:21,413
Demande!

312
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,985
Saphir...

313
00:21:33,725 --> 00:21:36,895
Wiseman!

314
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:38,897
[gasp]

315
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:43,302
[soft breathing]

316
00:21:50,709 --> 00:21:53,812
[startled]

317
00:21:54,413 --> 00:21:56,882
I'm sorry Petz..."

318
00:21:57,015 --> 00:21:58,884
It's alright.

319
00:22:00,018 --> 00:22:02,955
Somehow, I knew
this would happen.

320
00:22:03,288 --> 00:22:06,291
I felt it the
moment I let
him leave.

321
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:18,971
I will never
forget you,
Master Saphir.

322
00:22:20,939 --> 00:22:26,700
Your smile will
live on in my
heart..forever.

323
00:24:08,347 --> 00:24:12,751
Sailor Moon, your
beauty and strength
have always brought misfortune
to my people.

324
00:24:12,918 --> 00:24:18,624
But today, that will
change as I command you
to pledge your love and
loyaly to me and only me.

325
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:21,893
Demande, please stop!
This is not what
Saphir wanted!

326
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:26,999
You need to understand
the true meaning of love.
Only then can two people
connect with each other.

327
00:24:27,532 --> 00:24:32,638
Next time on Sailor Moon R,
"Believing in Love and the
Future: Usagi's Decision."

328
00:24:32,738 --> 00:24:35,507
The moonlight is
a messenger of love.
