is that it?!

155
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:55,356
Humph!

156
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:56,323
Hmm--

157
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:03,423
I can't believe how rude
Mamoru can be! He finds
something wrong with
everything I ever do!

158
00:11:03,456 --> 00:11:05,690
I didn't think he was
that full of himself!

159
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:16,556
This is terrible. Is it
possible that Mamoru and
I can't even get along
at all?

160
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:20,856
Please not that...!
[whimpering]

161
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:27,390
Sailor Moon...

162
00:11:27,423 --> 00:11:29,590
...'R'!

163
00:11:42,165 --> 00:11:44,532
Sailor Moon! R!

164
00:11:51,232 --> 00:11:56,832
[yawning]
Oh, it looks like
Usagi's up and gone
already.

165
00:11:56,865 --> 00:12:00,699
She always sleeps in on
Sundays... Where could
she have gone?

166
00:12:01,232 --> 00:12:03,799
[cooing]

167
00:12:03,832 --> 00:12:07,032
Do you think we got
enough milk and
disposable diapers?

168
00:12:07,065 --> 00:12:09,999
You bought too much
stuff. It's just two more
days!

169
00:12:11,032 --> 00:12:15,665
Oh! And just what is
that?! Mamoru and Tsukino
with an actual baby?!

170
00:12:15,699 --> 00:12:18,065
[gasping]
Did they really
consummate the love
they share?!

171
00:12:18,099 --> 00:12:19,899
Unforgivable...

172
00:12:19,932 --> 00:12:21,599
<i>Oh my goodness!</i>

173
00:12:21,632 --> 00:12:23,899
<i>Usagi! I can't believe</i>
<i>it..!</i>

174
00:12:23,932 --> 00:12:25,499
When did you have
Mamoru's baby?!

175
00:12:25,532 --> 00:12:30,632
Are you crazy, Minako?!
What makes you think I'd
ever be dumb enough to
do that?!

176
00:12:30,665 --> 00:12:33,599
Wow! You two look like
real parents, now.

177
00:12:33,632 --> 00:12:36,032
Hey! That's not
funny, Ami!

178
00:12:36,065 --> 00:12:37,699
Don't get so worked
up, Usagi.

179
00:12:37,732 --> 00:12:42,232
Did you seriously think
that the three of us
believed that you and
Mamoru had a baby

180
00:12:42,265 --> 00:12:43,999
since the last
time we saw you?

181
00:12:44,032 --> 00:12:46,099
Yeah. I was just
teasing you.

182
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:47,999
[groaning]

183
00:12:48,032 --> 00:12:49,865
Usagi...

184
00:12:49,899 --> 00:12:53,632
We're on our way over to
Rei's place so we can all
discuss how we're going
to stop that latest

185
00:12:53,665 --> 00:12:56,099
Cardian that's still on
the loose. Can you come
with us?

186
00:12:56,132 --> 00:12:57,499
Of course!

187
00:13:00,532 --> 00:13:03,732
Rin Pyo To Sha--

188
00:13:03,765 --> 00:13:07,132
Kai Jin Retsu Zai Zen!

189
00:13:08,065 --> 00:13:08,899
<i>Ha!</i>

190
00:13:10,532 --> 00:13:12,499
<i>That's her!</i>

191
00:13:12,532 --> 00:13:15,099
That's the monster who
attacked those kids
at the nursery school!

192
00:13:15,132 --> 00:13:19,665
She looks very similar
to a Sun tarot card image
that I've seen before...

193
00:13:23,832 --> 00:13:28,932
In Tarot, the Sun tarot
cardarcana signifies
contentment-a happy
marriage and love.

194
00:13:29,565 --> 00:13:32,099
Well that's a
wonderful meaning.

195
00:13:32,132 --> 00:13:37,665
However, when reversed,
the Sun Card signifies
a different outcome-a
broken engagement-marital

196
00:13:37,699 --> 00:13:39,765
woes, loneliness and
failure.

197
00:13:39,799 --> 00:13:40,865
That's awful!

198
00:13:40,899 --> 00:13:44,599
So which outcome will
happen for Usagi and
Mamoru?

199
00:13:44,632 --> 00:13:49,632
Aw, come on! All of you
know that Mamoru and I
aren't even close to
being a couple yet!

200
00:13:49,665 --> 00:13:52,899
Well, you better be
careful someone else
doesn't steal him away.

201
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:57,599
I just can't stand the
thought of letting that
happen! I'm going back to
Manami!

202
00:13:58,999 --> 00:14:03,465
Oh no! I can sense its
presence! It's close. We
have to go find it and

203
00:14:03,499 --> 00:14:05,132
make sure to
defeat it for good.

204
00:14:05,165 --> 00:14:05,965
Right!

205
00:14:09,673 --> 00:14:10,099
Hm!

206
00:14:10,132 --> 00:14:10,999
[cooing]

207
00:14:11,032 --> 00:14:13,532
<i>[doorbell ringing]</i>

208
00:14:13,565 --> 00:14:14,599
Come in!

209
00:14:15,599 --> 00:14:17,365
Mamoru, I heard what
happened at the hospital.

210
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:24,099
They said you're caring
for a baby. That must be
hard. I came by to see
how I might help you.

211
00:14:24,132 --> 00:14:27,899
Oh, my. Look at the
mess you've made, you
naughty one.

212
00:14:27,932 --> 00:14:32,699
Mamoru is making a warm
bottle for you now. So
you need to stop that
loud crying, behave

213
00:14:32,732 --> 00:14:36,532
yourself and develop some
patience.

214
00:14:36,565 --> 00:14:39,032
<i>Yuck, I don't like this</i>
<i>girl!</i>

215
00:14:39,065 --> 00:14:40,799
Stop your crying!

216
00:14:40,832 --> 00:14:42,899
He might have just wet
his diaper.

217
00:14:42,932 --> 00:14:46,032
Oh! Right! I'll go ahead
and change him for you!

218
00:14:48,232 --> 00:14:50,599
Oh, it isn't
wet at all.

219
00:14:51,165 --> 00:14:56,432
<i>I don't like her. This</i>
<i>girl gives me the creeps!</i>
<i>I'll show her!</i>

220
00:14:56,732 --> 00:15:00,599
Why you little-! What a
nasty brat!

221
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:03,132
[panicking]

222
00:15:03,165 --> 00:15:04,732
[crying]

223
00:15:06,599 --> 00:15:11,532
That's better! You can
feel free to ask me to
help you with anything.

224
00:15:11,565 --> 00:15:16,599
However long I need to
stay here to help this
darling little child,
I'm here for you.

225
00:15:17,865 --> 00:15:20,532
<i>This girl seems like</i>
<i>she's a big fake!</i>

226
00:15:20,999 --> 00:15:22,465
[screaming]

227
00:15:22,499 --> 00:15:25,432
I've had it! I am going
home!

228
00:15:25,932 --> 00:15:29,799
Manami, I'm back! How
are you? Whuh?!

229
00:15:30,599 --> 00:15:31,965
Natsumi!?

230
00:15:31,999 --> 00:15:34,132
<i>Natsumi, wait!</i>

231
00:15:34,165 --> 00:15:35,499
Uh--

232
00:15:35,699 --> 00:15:37,199
Uh--

233
00:15:37,232 --> 00:15:42,165
So I guess you'll let
anyone help out with
Manami...

234
00:15:43,932 --> 00:15:45,665
Wait, Bun-Head!

235
00:15:45,699 --> 00:15:46,832
Let go of me!

236
00:15:46,865 --> 00:15:49,032
Natsumi just came here
because she wanted to
help.

237
00:15:49,065 --> 00:15:50,899
Good! I'm
going home!

238
00:15:50,932 --> 00:15:53,199
What are you so mad
about, Usagi?

239
00:15:53,232 --> 00:15:57,532
I simply can't be around
a guy who doesn't understand
that a girl has feelings!

240
00:15:57,899 --> 00:15:58,999
Uh--

241
00:16:00,499 --> 00:16:03,132

242
00:16:03,165 --> 00:16:04,099
Aaah!

243
00:16:04,132 --> 00:16:05,032
Huh?

244
00:16:05,065 --> 00:16:05,865
Look!

245
00:16:05,899 --> 00:16:06,765
Wha?!?

246
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,232
[cooing]

247
00:16:08,265 --> 00:16:09,999
Ah!

248
00:16:16,765 --> 00:16:18,232
Oh, wow,
he's--

249
00:16:18,265 --> 00:16:19,899
--He's really
walking!

250
00:16:32,499 --> 00:16:36,099
[laughing]
He did it!

251
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:38,832
[laughing]
He did it! He did it!

252
00:16:38,865 --> 00:16:40,065
What's going on?

253
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:40,999
Huh?

254
00:16:41,032 --> 00:16:43,665
Am I interrupting
you two?

255
00:16:43,699 --> 00:16:47,065
You've got this all
wrong! It's Manami!
It's Manami...

256
00:16:47,099 --> 00:16:49,465
...He just took his very
first steps!

257
00:16:49,499 --> 00:16:51,465
Oh?! Really?!

258
00:16:51,499 --> 00:16:53,865
C'mon little guy, walk
again. Show her what you
can do...!

259
00:16:53,899 --> 00:16:55,999
You can do it, Manami!

260
00:16:57,699 --> 00:17:00,032
Usagi, it's that
Cardian. There's trouble!

261
00:17:00,065 --> 00:17:01,099
Huh?!

262
00:17:01,132 --> 00:17:03,532
Rei sensed its
presence. It's very
close!

263
00:17:03,565 --> 00:17:05,499
Mamoru, I have to go!

264
00:17:05,532 --> 00:17:07,965
Something urgent just
came up! I'll be back!

265
00:17:07,999 --> 00:17:09,765
Excuse us!

266
00:17:09,799 --> 00:17:11,599
Uh...

Huh!

273
00:17:41,965 --> 00:17:46,032
We cannot allow you to
prey on the young, taking
life energy from babies!

274
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:48,532
You're the worst
monster we've had yet.

<i>They will respond to</i>
your love with a smile

babies as human shields
to protect yourself is
unforgivable!

when did you acquire such

A new power awoke in me
when I saw those helpless
babies being threatened.

Quick, Sailor Moon! Soon
the sun's heat will thaw
out that Cardian and
she'll attack again!

Gotcha! I am on it!

00:20:38,199 --> 00:20:40,499
In the name of the
Moon, I'll punish you!

310
00:20:59,232 --> 00:21:06,465
Moon Princess Halation!

311
00:21:11,699 --> 00:21:13,799
Cleansing!

312
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:23,965
[crying]

313
00:21:23,999 --> 00:21:30,865
A child understands. A
whole lifetime of caring.
And dear mother's
love. Adieu!

314
00:21:30,899 --> 00:21:33,732
Thank you so much,
Moonlight Knight!

315
00:21:38,499 --> 00:21:41,599
Manami! Your mommy's
coming home from the
hospital!

316
00:21:43,032 --> 00:21:45,132
[cooing]

317
00:21:45,165 --> 00:21:46,865
Oh! My baby!

318
00:21:48,532 --> 00:21:52,132
I was so happy that they
released me from the
hospital a day earlier
than expected.

319
00:21:52,165 --> 00:21:53,799
Thank you so
much, you two.

320
00:21:53,832 --> 00:21:54,765
Our pleasure.

321
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:57,632
We didn't do that
much. Besides, it
was fun!

322
00:21:57,665 --> 00:22:00,599
Boy, Manami, am I going
to miss looking after
you!

323
00:22:00,632 --> 00:22:04,099
But there's nothing
better than being loved
and looked after by your
own mommy.

324
00:22:04,132 --> 00:22:05,599
Isn't that right,
little buddy?

325
00:22:05,632 --> 00:22:07,132
I know that, but...

326
00:22:07,165 --> 00:22:08,832
Mamoru...

327
00:22:08,865 --> 00:22:10,532
Huh?

328
00:22:10,565 --> 00:22:11,765
Usagi...

329
00:22:11,799 --> 00:22:13,932
Huh?

330
00:22:13,965 --> 00:22:15,799
Bye-bye!

331
00:22:21,732 --> 00:22:24,099
Did Manami...

332
00:22:24,132 --> 00:22:25,999
... Say our names?

333
00:22:26,032 --> 00:22:31,032
He talked! He spoke! He
said our names! Hooray!
Yay!

334
00:24:10,723 --> 00:24:13,723
There's a festival
going on at Rei's
school today!

335
00:24:13,756 --> 00:24:17,856
<i>I can't wait to eat</i>
<i>all the takoyaki,</i>
<i>yakisoba, and</i>
<i>okonomiyaki!</i>

336
00:24:17,889 --> 00:24:19,789
Is food all you think of?!

337
00:24:19,823 --> 00:24:24,489
But wow, Rei sure is
popular! Look! She's
even having her own
concert!

338
00:24:24,523 --> 00:24:27,356
<i>Psh, whatever. You know</i>
<i>she's just doing it for</i>
<i>all the attention.</i>

339
00:24:27,389 --> 00:24:28,423
Oh, grow up.

340
00:24:30,489 --> 00:24:33,523
<i>Next time, on Sailor</i>
<i>Moon R: The School</i>
<i>Festival is for Me?!</i>
<i>Queen Rei's Song.</i>

341
00:24:33,556 --> 00:24:36,558
<i>The moonlight is a</i>
<i>messenger of love.</i>
