1
00:01:57,284 --> 00:02:02,723
Chibi-Usa stole my Silver
Crystal and tried to return
to the future. That's what
alerted Rubeus as to her

2
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:08,795
whereabouts. The other
Sailor Guardians raced to
protect her, but were sucked
up into Rubeus' UFO.

3
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:15,769
Chibi-Usa! Everyone
is gone because of
you!

4
00:02:28,782 --> 00:02:33,553
Listen to me, Sailor
Moon! Even though you
avoided capture with
the others, you might

5
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,188
as well give
yourself up!

6
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:40,360
Face it, without your
fellow Sailor Guardians,
there isn't much you can
do on your own to save

7
00:02:40,394 --> 00:02:47,367
your precious city. However,
I'll allow you time to
think it over. No rush.
But I will return to this

8
00:02:47,434 --> 00:02:50,937
spot three hours from
now, at three a.m.

9
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:55,509
And I'll expect you to
have made up your mind
by then.

10
00:02:55,609 --> 00:02:58,612
[evil laughter]

11
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:10,791
No!

12
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:22,402
"Defeat Rubeus: The
Battle in Space"

13
00:03:45,025 --> 00:03:49,096
[laughing]

14
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:52,466
Hmph!

15
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,534
[giggling]

16
00:03:54,668 --> 00:03:58,271
Just idly standing
around waiting, Rubeus?

17
00:03:58,338 --> 00:04:03,276
You wouldn't have to if
you had gotten rid of
Sailor Moon and the Rabbit
when you had a chance.

18
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:06,413
Hmph! You, being a
woman, wouldn't
understand.

19
00:04:06,646 --> 00:04:11,184
I want to savor every
moment of eliminating
that girl. I want her
to suffer!

20
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,520
Oh... Is that so?

21
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:31,238
Now that I have these
hostages, Sailor Moon
is demoralized. She'll
come here to get them

22
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:37,577
back. And when she does, I
will slowly and painfully
kill her, right in front
of their eyes.

23
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:39,012
Really?

24
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:43,750
I hope it all goes
according to plan.
I'll pray for your
success.

25
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,952
[laughing]

26
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,627
Ha! Watch me,
woman.

27
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:57,130
I'll show you just how
powerful I can be.

28
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:09,376
Chibi-Usa...

29
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:10,410
Well...

30
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:13,814
Mamo, I'm pretty sure
you're Tuxedo Mask,
right?

31
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:17,551
Uh, yeah. I guess
it's time to fess
up.

32
00:05:17,584 --> 00:05:20,187
Knew it. Nothing
surprises me
anymore.

33
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:24,324
Especially after
finding out that
Usagi is also
Sailor Moon.

34
00:05:25,192 --> 00:05:31,331
By the way, Chibi-Usa,
did you finally return
the Silver Crystal
brooch to Usako?

35
00:05:31,364 --> 00:05:32,365
Mm-hm...

36
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:38,138
I don't know why this
didn't work the way
its supposed to.

37
00:05:38,138 --> 00:05:41,408
And if it did, you would
have taken the Silver
Crystal with you when you

38
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:43,977
went back to the
future. Right?

39
00:05:44,144 --> 00:05:44,978
Uh...

40
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:52,085
Chibi-Usa, I want us to
stop keeping secrets
from each other.

41
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:56,723
What exactly were you
planning to do with the
Silver Crystal when you
got it back home.

42
00:05:56,756 --> 00:06:02,229
It's for Mommy. I need
the Silver Crystal to
rescue her from those
bad people.

43
00:06:02,896 --> 00:06:05,799
Please! Chibi-Usa!
Straight answers...

44
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:09,102
What happened? Tell
me everything you
can remember.

45
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,104
I don't know.

46
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:12,205
Chibi-Usa!

47
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:19,379
I really don't know much
of anything. Those people
just showed up out of
nowhere...

48
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:23,216
[sobbing]

49
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:31,491
The large unidentified
flying object that
appeared in the sky over
the Juban District, seems

50
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:36,096
to have flown off into
the night. However, there
is a growing anxiety among
residents that the object

51
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:38,231
may have altered
something in their
neighborhood.

52
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:40,233
Only thirty
minutes left.

53
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:44,371
Usagi, what happened
to Mamoru and Chibi-
Usa? Where'd they go?

54
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,473
I think their up on
the roof together.

55
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:49,209
I guess he's having
a little talk with
her.

56
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,579
She's making it
so difficult!

57
00:06:54,447 --> 00:06:57,984
I really don't care that
she's being targeted. I
know I should protect her
but I don't feel like

58
00:06:58,051 --> 00:07:00,453
doing that anymore!
Not after what she did!

59
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:01,621
Usagi!

60
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:08,461
I almost feel like handing
over the Silver Crystal and
Chibi-Usa to the enemy, just
so I can get everyone back!

61
00:07:08,495 --> 00:07:12,132
If she hadn't appeared,
we wouldn't have gotten
into this whole mess,

62
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:14,267
and this city would
have stayed peaceful.

63
00:07:14,301 --> 00:07:18,305
Usagi! I don't like
to hear you talking
like this! Do you
mean it?

64
00:07:18,338 --> 00:07:20,473
[whimpering cry]

65
00:07:20,507 --> 00:07:22,375
Of course not...

66
00:07:24,044 --> 00:07:28,181
But it's pretty obvious
I'm not mature enough
to remain strong in
times like these.

67
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:30,650
It'll be alright.

68
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:34,788
I'm tired. And I'm
sorry for being so
negative.

69
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:38,458
It's okay. Why don't you
rest for a minute while
Luna and I put our heads

70
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,660
together to come up
with a workable plan.

71
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:46,066
Thank you. I think
I'll go out on the
balcony for a bit and
try to clear my head.

72
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:50,437
[worried sigh]

73
00:08:05,452 --> 00:08:09,189
That's it. I'm just
going to have to
confront the enemy
alone.

74
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:13,426
If I bring the Silver
Crystal along with me,
maybe that'll distract
him just enough.

75
00:08:14,294 --> 00:08:19,566
At the very least it
should draw his attention
away from Chibi-Usa, and
keep her safe...

76
00:08:21,201 --> 00:08:26,172
I can just hear my old
self saying, "I'm scared!",
"I'm sleepy!", "I don't want

77
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:29,175
to do this thing all
alone!" Noooo!

78
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,511
I guess my crying
days are over.

79
00:08:35,749 --> 00:08:40,053
Hold on, everyone. I'm
coming to rescue you,
now!

80
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:49,195
As I see it, our best
option is for one of us
to hand Rubeus a fake

81
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,064
Silver Crystal, in
order to buy some
time...

82
00:08:51,097 --> 00:08:55,668
...While the other sneaks
aboard the spacecraft and
rescues everyone before
he can react.

83
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:58,571
But won't he be
expecting Chibi-
Usa to deliver it?

84
00:08:58,605 --> 00:08:59,339
Uh...

85
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:01,241
Hmm...

86
00:09:04,611 --> 00:09:09,115
Ah! I've got it! What
if the two of us
disguise ourselves as
Chibi-Usa!

87
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:10,250
Hmm...

88
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:17,590
I'm the Rabbit! I'm
the Rabbit! I'm the
Rabbit! I'm the Rabbit!
I'm the- Ahhhh!

89
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,196
I'm afraid we're not
going to be able to
make this work.

90
00:09:23,263 --> 00:09:24,197
Uh-huh...

91
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:27,967
The front door's wide
open! Where's Usako?!
I can't find her!

92
00:09:28,001 --> 00:09:28,601
What?!

93
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:33,239
She's not here!

94
00:09:33,273 --> 00:09:34,641
I suspected this...

95
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:39,245
What? Are you thinking
that she, you know, took
off without a word to go

96
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,281
rescue the Sailor
Guardians herself?

97
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:43,450
It's entirely
possible.

98
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:50,457
But that's total
suicide! Rubeus
will kill her for
sure!

99
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:51,591
[gasp]

100
00:09:52,192 --> 00:09:54,594
Chibi-Usa?
Chibi-Usa!

101
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:58,098
She must've run
out after Usagi!

102
00:09:58,164 --> 00:10:01,234
You're probably right.
Those two are on the
same wavelength.

103
00:10:01,234 --> 00:10:05,405
Man, if it weren't for
the age difference, those
girls could easily be
identical twins.

104
00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:14,447

off on you. But I don't

109
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:02,762
want to put anyone else

alone.

You showed up on time,

The Rabbit?!

Chibi-Usa! What
are you doing here?

115
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:34,360
I'm going, too. It's my
fault the Sailor Guardians
were taken away, when all

116
00:11:34,394 --> 00:11:36,429
they were trying to
do was protect me.

117

No! Don't you get it?
If you come, you'll
be doing what the
enemy wants.

We're too late!

We can't stop
them! Damn!

[chuckling]

00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,329
Nice of you to
come, Sailor Moon.

129
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:46,566
And I appreciate your
bringing the Rabbit
along, as well.

130
00:12:46,566 --> 00:12:48,134
You bastard!

00:12:48,201 --> 00:12:48,935
Agh!

00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:56,075
Go ahead, laugh! The
joke's on you. This
child isn't your
elusive Rabbit!

134
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:58,978
She's my very
disobedient
cousin!

135
00:12:59,045 --> 00:12:59,612
Huh?

136
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,716
Come on, did you seriously
think I would simply hand
the Rabbit over to you?

137
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:04,684
Dummy!

138
00:13:05,318 --> 00:13:07,520
You completely
fell for it!

139
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:11,791
Huh! I'll have plenty
of time to test whether
that's true or not,
later.

140
00:13:12,492 --> 00:13:13,459
But first...

141
00:13:13,493 --> 00:13:15,628
I plan to deal
with you!

142
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:17,530
Fine!

143
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:23,136
Now, little cousin. You
need to move away, find
some spot where you'll
be safe.

144
00:13:23,436 --> 00:13:26,139
Oh. Uh. All right.

145
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:30,009
Okay, bring
it on!

146
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:30,543
Hmph!

147
00:13:34,347 --> 00:13:38,117
What are we going to
do? If that craft goes
into orbit in outer space,

148
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:39,619
there's no way
they can escape!

149
00:13:39,619 --> 00:13:40,286
Yeah!

150
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,288

00:13:45,792 --> 00:13:50,129
That was merely a warm-
up exercise. Now you
will pay for the bitter

153
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:52,231
experiences you
have given me.

Hmph!

156
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:31,104
Hey, what happened?
Moon Princess Halation
isn't working!

157
00:14:31,671 --> 00:14:32,338
Agh!

158
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:37,377
My body feels heavy.

Shall I tell you
what's happening?

161
00:14:41,681 --> 00:14:46,386
My ship enables me to
amplify my power to
play with the forces
of nature.

162
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:50,223
You're experiencing
my super-gravity
right now.

163
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:53,259
In case you're wondering,
I can do the opposite, too.

164
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:53,860

I thought you'd
never ask.

168
00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:10,410
Outer space. Tens of
thousands of meters
above the earth's
surface.

169
00:15:10,443 --> 00:15:13,079
It's impossible
for you to escape.

she is the Rabbit.

174
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:46,345
I suggest you stop
your futile rescue
efforts...

...There's a high voltage
shield surrounding them
that will zap you every
time you try to get near.

I will save
my friends!

193
00:16:41,534 --> 00:16:42,702
And I will...

194
00:16:42,735 --> 00:16:44,303
...defeat you!

195
00:16:45,638 --> 00:16:49,375
That's impossible! You
can't stand up in the
super-gravity field!

196
00:16:50,076 --> 00:16:55,014
If Chibi-Usa has the
courage to try to break
through your high-voltage
barrier...

197
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:59,318
Then I, Sailor Moon, am
determined to find the
strength to do nothing
less!

198
00:16:59,485 --> 00:17:04,390
Hmph! You're not as
helpless as I thought.
I underestimated you
quite a bit.

Everybody's here
because of me. So
it's my responsibility

stop this thing and

00:18:15,528 --> 00:18:18,164
Now, Chibi-Usa!
Do it!

00:18:18,197 --> 00:18:18,731
Right!

Does anyone know
where we are?

226
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:48,961
The last thing I can
remember is Rubeus
capturing us.

227
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:52,398
I'm sorry. This
is my fault.

228
00:18:52,565 --> 00:18:53,566
Chibi-Usa!

229
00:18:57,036 --> 00:18:59,639
I'm so happy.
You're all okay.

230
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:01,207

You think everything's
okay now? You fools!

234
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:11,617
This ship is out of
control and is going
to blow up at any
given moment.

235
00:19:11,684 --> 00:19:15,054
And when that happens,
you'll all become space
dust.

236
00:19:15,087 --> 00:19:16,689
Why should we
believe you?

237
00:19:16,722 --> 00:19:19,225
That would mean you're
gonna end up the same
way!

238
00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:21,093
[laughing]

239
00:19:21,127 --> 00:19:24,363
Exactly! I won't ever
be able to return to
the future!

240
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:30,002
However, at least I'll
have the satisfaction of
knowing you're coming
along with me.

241
00:19:30,036 --> 00:19:31,203
[screaming]

242
00:19:31,237 --> 00:19:32,505
Ah! Rubeus!

243
00:19:35,274 --> 00:19:39,412
We'd better figure a way
out of here quick, or
we're all going to go up
in flames with him!

244
00:19:39,445 --> 00:19:42,081
We're up in a
spaceship. Where
are we gonna go?

245
00:19:42,114 --> 00:19:44,183
There is a way, but
it's a long shot.

246
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:45,117
Huh?!

247
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:49,588
Wait, Mercury, are
you thinking of using
Sailor Teleport?

248
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:50,956
Yes.

249
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:54,093
That's nuts! Sailor
Moon used up all her
energy, and don't forget

250
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:56,262
we have Chibi-Usa
with us here, as well!

251
00:19:56,295 --> 00:20:00,399
If we put our hearts and
minds together, I believe
it's possible to make it

252
00:20:00,433 --> 00:20:03,335
work! We have to take
that chance and try!

253
00:20:03,402 --> 00:20:05,171
My energy is
just fine!

254
00:20:05,438 --> 00:20:07,006
Chibi-Usa, concentrate
with all your heart and
mind.

255
00:20:09,075 --> 00:20:11,010
Hm! I'll do my best!

256
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:14,113
That's the spirit.
You'll get a treat
when we get home.

257
00:20:15,181 --> 00:20:17,383
I want hotcakes,
with lots of
syrup.

It's a deal.

get started.

Ah, Esmeraude. You came
to check up on me and
I'm so glad you did.

271
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:49,348
Now take me back to
the future with you!

272
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:52,418
We need to hurry. This
ship is going to explode
in two minutes.

Oh, tough luck.

the Sailor Guardians and
the Rabbit to escape.

And now you want
me to save you?

pathetic specimen.

really has no use
for an incompetent
man who has failed

all a favor and vanish
with this ship.
