Mako! You've gotta go

As for me. In the name
of the Moon, I'll

The Moonlight Knight.

He's a mystery all right.

5
00:02:39,814 --> 00:02:44,914
Whenever we're in
danger, he appears out of
nowhere and saves us. I
wonder who he is?

6
00:02:45,114 --> 00:02:49,947
The way he leaves by
saying adieu... He's
just like the guy, who
broke my heart.

7
00:02:49,981 --> 00:02:54,081
Your old boyfriend used
to say adieu??? Wait
a minute, so he was
French?

was like that.

Ta da! Guess what I did?
Lookit! I made a special
lunch just for you!

Oh, is it fried
shrimp again?

13

No, love. It's got bell
peppers, okura, plus
fried shrimp today!

add some variety for you.

Fried Shrimp! Fried
Shrimp! Yay! Yay! Yay!

16

Mako, have you
noticed that making a
lunch for a girlfriend or
boyfriend is really

17
00:03:21,514 --> 00:03:23,081
popular these days?

18
00:03:23,114 --> 00:03:31,847
Yeah, I guess I just
haven't made a special
lunch... for anyone...
in a long time.

19
00:03:31,881 --> 00:03:38,381
Are you okay? Oh no.
Usagi didn't show up.
I'm positive I told her
that we were going to

20
00:03:38,414 --> 00:03:41,447

to talk about who the
Moonlight Knight is.

Does Seijuro also remind
you of the guy who broke
your heart?

[giggling] No, but
Seijuro does love music,

realized that Seijuro
transferred to our
school around the

154
00:11:23,581 --> 00:11:24,581
Go away!

155
00:11:24,614 --> 00:11:25,947
[growling]

156
00:11:25,981 --> 00:11:27,081
[struggling]

157
00:11:27,114 --> 00:11:28,514
[growling]

158
00:11:28,547 --> 00:11:29,547
[struggling]

159
00:11:29,581 --> 00:11:30,447
[growling]

160
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:30,947
[struggling]

161
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:31,581
[growling]

162
00:11:31,614 --> 00:11:32,081
[struggling]

163
00:11:35,914 --> 00:11:37,414
Sailor Moon...

164
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:38,547
...'R'!

165
00:11:52,932 --> 00:11:55,398
<i>Sailor Moon! R!</i>

166
00:11:57,298 --> 00:12:02,732
Miss Tsukino... You were
tardy, you forgot your
homework, you slept in
class all morning, and

167
00:12:02,765 --> 00:12:05,898
then you slept in class
all through the
afternoon!

168
00:12:05,932 --> 00:12:06,965
I'm so sorry, ma'am.

169
00:12:06,998 --> 00:12:08,998
Forget it. Just go home.

170
00:12:09,032 --> 00:12:09,932
Yes, ma'am.

171
00:12:10,332 --> 00:12:14,165
[weakly grunting]

172
00:12:14,198 --> 00:12:16,365
Oh, Usagi! You okay?

173
00:12:16,398 --> 00:12:21,065
Nope. I'm so hungry I
can't feel anything at
all.

174
00:12:21,098 --> 00:12:21,732
Usagi.

175
00:12:21,765 --> 00:12:24,465
Oh, Luna. Hey! Is
that--?

176
00:12:24,498 --> 00:12:25,365
[sheepishly laughing]

177
00:12:25,398 --> 00:12:28,265
It-It's my lunch! I
don't believe it!

178
00:12:28,298 --> 00:12:30,832
I guess she wasn't able
to give it to you this
morning.

179
00:12:30,865 --> 00:12:34,232
I love you, I love
you, I love you, I
love you, I love you.

180
00:12:34,732 --> 00:12:37,198
I'm telling you it's all
a misunderstanding!

181
00:12:37,232 --> 00:12:38,232
Liar!

182
00:12:38,265 --> 00:12:40,065
An.

183
00:12:40,098 --> 00:12:43,232
How could you be so cruel
and eat human food?!
After all the years
we've spent together,

184
00:12:43,265 --> 00:12:46,732
sharing the Makai
Tree's energy?! What
you did is totally
disrespectful.

185
00:12:46,765 --> 00:12:48,132
Wait. No, listen.

186
00:12:48,165 --> 00:12:49,398
<i>Hi, Seijuro!</i>

187
00:12:50,298 --> 00:12:52,298
Do you want to walk home
with me?

188
00:12:53,265 --> 00:12:54,465
Uh--uh--

189
00:12:54,498 --> 00:12:57,198
What are you waiting for?
Go ahead! Enjoy your new
friend!

190
00:12:57,232 --> 00:12:59,065
A-An-- I mean, Natsumi!

191
00:12:59,098 --> 00:13:03,365
Don't worry about
little old me. Take your
sweet time!

192
00:13:03,398 --> 00:13:04,398
Oh my goodness.

193
00:13:04,432 --> 00:13:05,932
What's her problem?

194
00:13:05,965 --> 00:13:11,432
So, uh, I was wondering
if we could, like, talk
about stuff, you know?

195
00:13:11,465 --> 00:13:13,965
Uh, sure.

196
00:13:15,965 --> 00:13:20,032
I could tell back there
that your sister likes
you a lot. You two seem
like you're really close.

197
00:13:20,065 --> 00:13:21,765
You think so?

198
00:13:21,798 --> 00:13:23,298
She must be furious
with me.

199
00:13:23,332 --> 00:13:25,965
Huh? Wha-What's wrong?

200
00:13:25,998 --> 00:13:30,332
Oh, nothing. It's just
that Natsumi seems to
really hate me for some
reason.

201
00:13:30,365 --> 00:13:32,132
[chuckling]

202
00:13:32,165 --> 00:13:35,898
Hey, since we're here
to get to know each other,
there's something I'd like
to ask you about.

203
00:13:35,932 --> 00:13:37,598
Sure! Ask me! Anything!

204
00:13:37,632 --> 00:13:43,365
Well, um, I don't
understand the logic
between liking someone and
making lunch for them.

205
00:13:43,398 --> 00:13:46,932
You don't get it at all?

206
00:13:46,965 --> 00:13:48,132
I don't.

207
00:13:48,165 --> 00:13:51,265
You're so funny.
[laughing]

208
00:13:51,298 --> 00:13:52,965
Uh, why are you laughing?

209
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:55,098
B-because--

210
00:13:56,065 --> 00:13:59,765
Damn you, Ail!

211
00:14:02,098 --> 00:14:06,032
What?! Mako is on a date
with Seijuro right now?!

212
00:14:06,065 --> 00:14:07,932
Usagi!

213
00:14:07,965 --> 00:14:12,932
It's not really a date. She
just wanted to see if he has
anything to do with the
Moonlight Knight.

214
00:14:12,965 --> 00:14:16,832
There's no way that
Seijuro is the Moonlight
Knight! Are you kidding
me?

215
00:14:19,932 --> 00:14:22,832
Thank you for the food!
Okay then!

216
00:14:22,865 --> 00:14:24,365
Hey, where are you
going?!

217
00:14:24,398 --> 00:14:27,965
I'm on a mission to
see whether or not it's
really a date!

218
00:14:27,998 --> 00:14:31,932
Seijuro said he likes me!
He better not be lying.
Gotta goooo!

219
00:14:32,732 --> 00:14:36,332
What was that about? I
thought she complained
that boy gave her nothing
but trouble.

220
00:14:36,365 --> 00:14:37,932
[chuckling]

221
00:14:37,965 --> 00:14:41,932
So then, you're saying
love and lunches are just
things that you give to
someone?

222
00:14:41,965 --> 00:14:43,898
That all sounds
backwards to me.

223
00:14:43,932 --> 00:14:45,232
Not at all.

224
00:14:45,265 --> 00:14:48,732
Love should be something
you simply reach out and
take for yourself!

225
00:14:48,765 --> 00:14:51,165
Why would you give
things to people for
love?

226
00:14:51,198 --> 00:14:53,198
Humph! I don't
get it at all.

227
00:14:53,232 --> 00:15:01,032
Really? You think love is
to be taken? But that's--
kinda sad.

228
00:15:01,065 --> 00:15:04,798
I mean, love comes in
many different ways but I
don't think it's something
you can--

229
00:15:04,832 --> 00:15:05,998
<i>Silence!</i>

230
00:15:06,032 --> 00:15:06,998
Huh?

231
00:15:07,032 --> 00:15:09,332
You meddlesome earth
female!

232
00:15:09,365 --> 00:15:10,065
[gasping]

233
00:15:10,098 --> 00:15:10,732
An?!

234
00:15:11,332 --> 00:15:12,665
I'll teach you a lesson!

235
00:15:13,365 --> 00:15:16,965
[grunting and screaming]

236
00:15:16,998 --> 00:15:17,832
[grunting]

237
00:15:19,498 --> 00:15:20,865
Who do you think you are?

238
00:15:20,898 --> 00:15:25,232
A primitive human like
you has no right to
lecture anyone about
love!

239
00:15:26,865 --> 00:15:28,232
Why you---

240
00:15:28,265 --> 00:15:30,132
[growling]

241
00:15:30,165 --> 00:15:31,165
W-Wait!

242
00:15:31,198 --> 00:15:32,198
Ha!

243
00:15:32,965 --> 00:15:34,332
[grunting]

244
00:15:35,498 --> 00:15:36,298
Mako!

245
00:15:36,332 --> 00:15:37,965
<i>It's that alien!</i>

246
00:15:37,998 --> 00:15:39,365
What's going on?!

247
00:15:39,398 --> 00:15:40,998
W-W-What should we do?!

248
00:15:41,032 --> 00:15:42,298
Ami, look after Mako!

249
00:15:42,332 --> 00:15:42,965
Mm!

250
00:15:42,998 --> 00:15:43,598
And me?!

251
00:15:43,632 --> 00:15:45,065
You transform and fight!

252
00:15:45,098 --> 00:15:46,032
Do I have to?

253
00:15:46,065 --> 00:15:46,732
Mmm!

254
00:15:47,998 --> 00:15:52,432
Moon Crystal Power Make
Up!

255
00:16:31,898 --> 00:16:35,932
My precious lunch box!
Ruined! You witch!

256
00:16:35,965 --> 00:16:39,298
What are you blabbering
about, human? Time to
finish you off now!

257
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:40,465
<i>Stop right there!</i>

258
00:16:40,498 --> 00:16:41,298
Uh?!

259
00:16:41,332 --> 00:16:43,232
Sailor Moon!

260
00:16:43,265 --> 00:16:47,732
How dare you ruin a young
girl's date with a cute
boy! That sort of crime
is truly unforgivable!

261
00:16:47,765 --> 00:16:51,198
Only a big, huge,
oversized, ginormous,
humongous pest!

262
00:16:51,232 --> 00:16:54,098
Says the person who was
just about to do the same
thing.

263
00:16:54,132 --> 00:16:58,165
Humph! A lower life form
like you calling me a
pest? You need to learn
your place, girl!

264
00:16:58,198 --> 00:16:59,965
Oh yeah?!

265
00:16:59,998 --> 00:17:02,298
I am Sailor Moon! In the
name of the--

266
00:17:04,865 --> 00:17:06,798
W-What's going on?!

267
00:17:06,998 --> 00:17:09,198
I-I can't move!

268
00:17:10,065 --> 00:17:12,398
Ail! You
stay out of this!

269
00:17:12,432 --> 00:17:14,732
I can't stand you.

270
00:17:14,765 --> 00:17:16,765
Don't say anything.

271
00:17:16,798 --> 00:17:17,665
[blushing]

272
00:17:17,898 --> 00:17:21,898
An, please trust me.

273
00:17:21,932 --> 00:17:22,534
Ail...

274
00:17:23,298 --> 00:17:26,232
Now pick a Cardian that's
worthy of this occasion.

275
00:17:26,265 --> 00:17:28,198
[sighing]
Okay.

276
00:17:30,765 --> 00:17:34,665
Come forth, Cardian! Our
servant, Utonberino!

277
00:17:44,265 --> 00:17:47,065
Utonberino!

278
00:17:47,098 --> 00:17:49,865
[struggling]
What?

279
00:17:49,898 --> 00:17:50,332
[grunting]

280
00:17:50,365 --> 00:17:51,332
Mako!

281
00:17:51,998 --> 00:17:53,798
Utonberino!

282
00:17:53,998 --> 00:17:59,765
[grunting and yelling]

283
00:18:01,332 --> 00:18:02,298
[grunting]

284
00:18:02,332 --> 00:18:05,932
[laughing] You've met
your match, Sailor Moon!

285
00:18:05,965 --> 00:18:07,332
Utonberino!

286
00:18:07,765 --> 00:18:09,265
Mako, are you okay?!

287
00:18:09,298 --> 00:18:13,998
Yeah. Those guys are
gonna pay for ruining
my special lunch filled
with love.

288
00:18:14,032 --> 00:18:16,098
I think it's time to
teach them a lesson.

289
00:18:16,132 --> 00:18:17,032
Right!

290
00:18:17,332 --> 00:18:20,698
Jupiter Power Make Up!

291
00:18:32,365 --> 00:18:35,198
Sailor Jupiter!

292
00:18:35,232 --> 00:18:36,298
Sailor Jupiter!

293
00:18:36,332 --> 00:18:38,198
I'm here. Leave the
rest to me!

294
00:18:38,232 --> 00:18:41,432
Utonberino, get rid of
those Sailor Guardians!

295
00:18:41,465 --> 00:18:45,032
[grunting and screaming]

296
00:18:46,465 --> 00:18:49,098
Rino! Rino rino
rinoooooo!!!

297
00:18:49,132 --> 00:18:50,398
[gasping]

298
00:18:53,765 --> 00:18:58,132
Supreme...
what is this?!

299
00:18:58,165 --> 00:18:59,232
Jupiter!

300
00:18:59,265 --> 00:19:01,998
[laughing] Excellent
work, Utonberino.

301
00:19:02,032 --> 00:19:04,765
Now bundle Sailor Moon
and her friends into a
sushi roll!

302
00:19:04,798 --> 00:19:06,865
Rino!

303
00:19:07,232 --> 00:19:09,998
[gasping]

304
00:19:10,032 --> 00:19:11,165
Rino Rino Rino!

305
00:19:11,198 --> 00:19:14,732
[panicking]

306
00:19:14,765 --> 00:19:16,965
Sailor Moon! Sailor
Mercury!

[struggling]

308
00:19:19,198 --> 00:19:20,932
Rino rinooooo!

[screaming]

00:19:23,065 --> 00:19:24,665
[gasping]

00:19:24,932 --> 00:19:26,732
I can't breathe!
[laughing]

00:19:26,765 --> 00:19:29,932
Now that's
entertainment!
[laughing]

313
00:19:29,965 --> 00:19:32,732
If only I could move
my arms!

314
00:19:34,432 --> 00:19:36,232
That rose!
[gasping]

315
00:19:36,265 --> 00:19:37,198
[gasping]

316
00:19:37,465 --> 00:19:38,832
It's the Moonlight
Knight!

317
00:19:40,565 --> 00:19:45,032
The power of the
moonlight shines down on
all. Even to those who
have lost sight of love.

318
00:19:45,065 --> 00:19:48,398
Love that makes one risk
their own life for
another, is true love.

319
00:19:48,432 --> 00:19:51,498
Beautiful and courageous,
it shines brightly.

320
00:19:51,532 --> 00:19:55,132
True love and courage...
I get it now!

321
00:19:55,165 --> 00:19:59,032
I'm willing to put my
life on the line... for
my cherished friends!

322
00:20:00,932 --> 00:20:07,198
Jupiter, my guardian
planet! Bring forth a
storm! Summon the clouds!
And bring down your thunder!

323
00:20:10,232 --> 00:20:14,865
Supreme Thunder Dragon!

324
00:20:17,298 --> 00:20:18,732
Rino rino rino!

325
00:20:22,832 --> 00:20:26,365
Rino Rino Rino Rino
Rinooooo!

326
00:20:27,798 --> 00:20:28,865
R-Rino!

327
00:20:28,898 --> 00:20:29,765
How impudent!

328
00:20:29,798 --> 00:20:36,098
Crescent Beam Shower!

329
00:20:36,132 --> 00:20:36,898
Look out!

330
00:20:38,098 --> 00:20:41,332
Fire Soul!

331
00:20:42,298 --> 00:20:45,065
Hot hot hot!

332
00:20:45,298 --> 00:20:47,698
[groaning]

333
00:20:47,732 --> 00:20:49,932
Next time, Mars...
Less heat.

334
00:20:49,965 --> 00:20:52,032
I saved you didn't I?
Stop whining!

335
00:20:52,065 --> 00:20:54,832
You've gotta call when
you need help, okay?

336
00:20:54,865 --> 00:20:56,265
R-rinoooo!

337
00:20:56,298 --> 00:20:58,765
Sailor Moon! Finish her
off!

338
00:20:58,798 --> 00:21:00,065
You've got it!

339
00:21:17,332 --> 00:21:24,065
Moon Princess Halation!

340
00:21:28,298 --> 00:21:30,965
Cleansing!

341
00:21:36,365 --> 00:21:38,032
Dammit!

342
00:21:38,265 --> 00:21:39,265
[sighing]

343
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:41,165
<i>Excellent work, Sailor</i>
<i>Guardians.</i>

344
00:21:41,198 --> 00:21:42,298
[gasping]

345
00:21:42,332 --> 00:21:45,965
Moonlight Knight! Please
tell us. Who are you
really?!

346
00:21:45,998 --> 00:21:51,098
One day you will all find
out the truth. Until
then... Adieu!

347
00:21:51,898 --> 00:21:53,498
Uh--wait!

348
00:21:53,532 --> 00:21:55,398
Jupiter...

349
00:21:55,432 --> 00:21:59,432
He knows about the true
meaning of love. And that
tells me everything. He's
certainly not Seijuro.

350
00:21:59,465 --> 00:22:00,432
That's for sure.

351
00:22:00,465 --> 00:22:01,832
Of course Seijuro wasn't
the Moonlight Knight!

352
00:22:01,865 --> 00:22:05,232
Yeah, Moonlight Knight
looks much more like the
guy who broke my heart!

353
00:22:05,265 --> 00:22:07,065
[exaggerated groaning]

354
00:22:07,098 --> 00:22:10,765
The next time I see him,
I'm gonna make him a
special lunch filled with
delicious food and love.

355
00:22:10,798 --> 00:22:11,265
[giggling]

356
00:22:12,332 --> 00:22:14,098
All done!

357
00:22:14,132 --> 00:22:16,398
<i>Ail? What is this?</i>

358
00:22:16,432 --> 00:22:20,332
It's umm... This is how
an Earthling expresses
their love for another.

359
00:22:20,365 --> 00:22:23,132
Oh, Ail! You mean you did
this all for me?

360
00:22:23,165 --> 00:22:24,365
Mmm-hmm.

361
00:22:24,398 --> 00:22:27,898
I'm so happy! But what
exactly should I do with
this thing?

362
00:22:27,932 --> 00:22:30,132
Yeah... That's the part I
don't get.

363
00:22:30,465 --> 00:22:31,265
Hmm.

364
00:24:11,782 --> 00:24:15,082
"Who was it that said a
first kiss tastes like
honey?"

365
00:24:15,115 --> 00:24:18,249
<i>"Because it doesn't. A</i>
<i>real kiss tastes much</i>
<i>sweeter, and--"</i>

366
00:24:18,282 --> 00:24:20,349
Hey, wait! Luna!
That's my diary!

367
00:24:20,382 --> 00:24:23,549
<i>While you're scribbling</i>
<i>away, someone's gonna</i>
<i>steal Mamoru from you!</i>

368
00:24:23,582 --> 00:24:27,415
They're just rehearsing a
play, but I can't stand
him kissing Natsumi!

369
00:24:27,449 --> 00:24:33,315
Next time, on Sailor Moon
R: Steal a Kiss from Mamoru.
An's Project Snow
White.

370
00:24:33,349 --> 00:24:36,115
The moonlight is a
messenger of love.
