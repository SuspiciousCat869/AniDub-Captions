1
00:01:57,849 --> 00:02:02,016
So get this: Rei's grandpa
started this weird business
called Protection Aesthetics.

2
00:02:02,049 --> 00:02:06,482
He says it's supposed to
make you become pretty
and fit, but I don't know.

3
00:02:06,516 --> 00:02:08,582
I just hope it doesn't
get him into trouble.

4
00:02:08,616 --> 00:02:11,016
Uh-oh, looks like
he is in trouble!

5
00:02:11,049 --> 00:02:12,749
Come on, we
gotta save
him!

6
00:02:12,782 --> 00:02:16,016
Rei you must punish them
with your new technique!

7
00:02:20,749 --> 00:02:23,149
(Grandpa Hino)
[sigh]

8
00:02:23,182 --> 00:02:28,049
I wonder why there
aren't any gals coming
to the shrine anymore?

9
00:02:28,082 --> 00:02:29,049
Who knows?

10
00:02:29,082 --> 00:02:30,582
[Rei]
Well, here's
your answer.

11
00:02:30,616 --> 00:02:32,749
What's this?
Huh?

12
00:02:32,782 --> 00:02:37,982
This month's Nanako magazine
has an article talking about
how you harass all the young
girls who visit Hikawa Shrine.

13
00:02:38,016 --> 00:02:39,816
What?!

14
00:02:39,849 --> 00:02:41,649
Oh no!!

15
00:02:41,682 --> 00:02:44,849
You weren't
kidding! Ooh..

16
00:02:44,882 --> 00:02:47,982
So you see Grandpa,
you need to change
your ways.

17
00:02:48,016 --> 00:02:50,949
Nope. I'm putting
you in charge
instead.

18
00:02:50,982 --> 00:02:52,716
Huh?!

19
00:02:52,749 --> 00:02:58,182
I'm done being a priest
and running this place,
I'm going to retire and
do something else!

20
00:02:58,216 --> 00:03:03,882
Having a shrine without
any girls, is like having
miso soup without any miso.

21
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:05,216
Huh?

22
00:03:09,649 --> 00:03:15,149
"Women Must Be Strong
and Beautiful: Rei's
New Special Technique."

23
00:03:25,082 --> 00:03:27,649
[Luna]
Wow, is she
actually studying?

24
00:03:27,682 --> 00:03:33,482
I should've
known.

25
00:03:33,516 --> 00:03:35,516
[tickled]
[startled]

26
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:40,516
Wh-aaa! Hand over the
Silver Crystal! Whaa!

27
00:03:40,549 --> 00:03:43,849
You wake me up,
you pay the price!
[laughing]

28
00:03:43,882 --> 00:03:47,782
I wish I were
stronger than
Usagi!
Wh-aaa!

29
00:03:47,816 --> 00:03:51,549
Oh no! I just remembered,
Rei asked me to go help
her out!
[yells]

30
00:03:51,582 --> 00:03:54,582
<i>Must...get...stronger.</i>

31
00:04:01,716 --> 00:04:06,649
Oh wow-wee!
This outfit looks
great on me. It's
so cool!

32
00:04:06,682 --> 00:04:07,482
Uh-hm!

33
00:04:07,516 --> 00:04:08,716
You look weird!

34
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:09,782
Shut it!

35
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:14,482
I wonder why we're
getting so many
visitors today.

36
00:04:14,516 --> 00:04:19,938
I think I know the reason
they all showed up. It's cuz
we're here dressed as beautiful
shrine shrine maidens!

37
00:04:20,116 --> 00:04:24,649
I get to be a maiden and
use my business math skills
at the same time. It's great.

38
00:04:24,682 --> 00:04:27,882
With this much work,
we better be getting
paid a lot!

39
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:29,849
Sure. You'll
all get paid!

40
00:04:29,882 --> 00:04:33,616
By the way Rei,
what sort of
business did your
grandpa start?

41
00:04:33,649 --> 00:04:38,682
Oh boy...
It's a really
weird one.

42
00:04:47,782 --> 00:04:59,516
[practice excercises]

43
00:05:06,216 --> 00:05:08,916
(Usagi)
Uh, what the heck
are they doing?

44
00:05:08,949 --> 00:05:12,949
He says it's a new sport
combining self-defense
with beauty workouts.

45
00:05:12,982 --> 00:05:17,516
I just wish the classes
weren't happening here
at the shrine. They're
a big pain.

46
00:05:17,549 --> 00:05:19,149
What do you
mean by that?!
[startled]

47
00:05:19,182 --> 00:05:21,649
It's inappropriate
and embarrassing!

48
00:05:21,682 --> 00:05:24,182
Plus you both look
ridiculous in those
outfits!

49
00:05:24,216 --> 00:05:26,849
Oh, well,
I kinda
like them.

50
00:05:26,882 --> 00:05:30,516
[snarl groan]
Do you wanna take
an old man's reason
for living away?!

51
00:05:30,549 --> 00:05:34,982
I know why you're doing this!
You just wanna get young girls
to take your class with you!

52
00:05:35,016 --> 00:05:36,549
And what's
wrong with
that?!

53
00:05:36,582 --> 00:05:38,116
It's just
wrong!

54
00:05:38,149 --> 00:05:40,516
[snarl groans]

55
00:05:40,549 --> 00:05:43,516
Well I will not
be responsible
for what happens.

56
00:05:43,549 --> 00:05:44,649
Hmph!

57
00:05:44,682 --> 00:05:47,716
So who'd like to
take our Protection
Aesthetics class?

58
00:05:47,749 --> 00:05:50,816
I-I-I need to
wash my hair!

59
00:05:50,849 --> 00:05:52,516
So can
I try?

60
00:05:52,549 --> 00:05:53,616
[running]

61
00:05:53,649 --> 00:05:55,616
(Chibi-Usa)
What are
you doing?!

62
00:05:55,649 --> 00:05:57,749
(Chibi-Usa)
Put me down, Usagi!

63
00:06:03,049 --> 00:06:05,916
(Calaveras)
Master Rubeus,
where is Koan?

64
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:08,582
I sent her to take
out our next target.

65
00:06:08,616 --> 00:06:09,782
Huh?!

66
00:06:09,816 --> 00:06:13,216
We have discovered
a new Crystal Point
in a different area.

67
00:06:18,616 --> 00:06:26,782
[chuckles]
Koan's very excited. She plans
to swap the Crystal Power in
this building with Dark Power.

68
00:06:26,816 --> 00:06:29,749
Why would you go
and give Koan such
an important mission?

69
00:06:29,782 --> 00:06:31,882
You didn't trust me
to go and do it!?

70
00:06:34,016 --> 00:06:36,249
I never
said that!

71
00:06:36,282 --> 00:06:39,116
(Grandpa Hino)
Come try our class!
Check us out!

72
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:44,482
Our Protection Aesthetics
class will make you young
ladies beautiful and uh, uh
strong!

73
00:06:46,116 --> 00:06:49,516
Hm! Not one
sign-up yet.

74
00:06:49,549 --> 00:06:55,149
[sigh] Where's Yuichiro,
he's supposed to be here
signing up girls for class!

75
00:06:55,182 --> 00:06:57,882
I can't count on
that young boy
for anything!

76
00:06:59,549 --> 00:07:00,549
Huhh?

77
00:07:00,582 --> 00:07:03,849
[laughing]
I'm ready
to sign up!

78
00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:10,882
Hmmm, I really only
wanted teenaged girls
and older. But she's
better than nobody.

79
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:13,016
Will I
become
strong?

80
00:07:13,049 --> 00:07:15,682
Ehh, so you want
to be strong?

81
00:07:15,716 --> 00:07:17,616
Hm!

82
00:07:17,649 --> 00:07:21,782
Once I become strong, I'll
take the Silver Crystal away
from Usagi and spank her good!
Owie owie owie!

83
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:23,949
Master!

84
00:07:23,982 --> 00:07:26,749
Ohh! Who are
all these ladies?

85
00:07:26,782 --> 00:07:28,949
Master! They all
want to sign up!

86
00:07:28,982 --> 00:07:35,882
[chuckles]
Well done, Yuichiro!
I knew you'd come through!

00:08:12,149 --> 00:08:17,949
[sinister laughing]
I can't wait for tomorrow.

89
00:08:22,082 --> 00:08:24,016
Good morning Rei!

90
00:08:24,049 --> 00:08:26,649
Sleep well?
It's already
afternoon.

91
00:08:26,682 --> 00:08:29,116
[gasp]
Sounds like you're
in a bad mood!

92
00:08:29,149 --> 00:08:30,849
Yeah Rei, is
something wrong?

93
00:08:30,882 --> 00:08:35,182
Yuichiro collected a big group
of girls and he's brought them
back to the shrine!
[groans]

94
00:08:35,216 --> 00:08:38,582
How cute!
You're jealous,
aren't you?

95
00:08:38,616 --> 00:08:40,782
I am not
jealous.
No way!

96
00:08:40,816 --> 00:08:42,082
I don't
believe
you!

97
00:08:42,116 --> 00:08:44,916
Are those gals
ready for class?

98
00:08:44,949 --> 00:08:46,682
Yes, they're waiting
for you Master.

99
00:08:46,716 --> 00:08:47,849
Good, good!

100
00:08:47,882 --> 00:08:50,716
Ugh! I wish they
hadn't done that!

C'mon!
Let's go
take a look!

103
00:08:54,516 --> 00:08:55,516
But I
don't
wanna.

104
00:08:55,549 --> 00:08:56,816
Ah don't be
like that!

At last! What I've been
hoping for all these years,
wall to wall women!

111
00:09:24,249 --> 00:09:30,549
[giggles]
With this many students,
you'll probably need female
instructors, don't you think?

112
00:09:30,582 --> 00:09:32,082
Uh, could be!

113
00:09:32,116 --> 00:09:37,149
Well my friend and I
know some good martial
art moves. Can we teach
the class?

114
00:09:37,182 --> 00:09:40,016
Sure cutey!

you do that?

Dumbull.

121
00:09:48,016 --> 00:09:51,582
Oh calm down. We're
simply teaching
Protection Aesthetics.

the heck?

doesn't

(Chibi-Usa)
Okay! Time to
get stronger!

132
00:10:14,149 --> 00:10:15,582
No don't do it!

It looks painful!

136
00:10:21,882 --> 00:10:26,549
You might be
right, Usagi.
I quit. See ya!

137
00:10:26,582 --> 00:10:28,516
I'd say that's
a good call.

That is it!

she's mad.

Are you alright?
She sure is rough.

147
00:10:46,716 --> 00:10:51,249
How was that? Did we
highlight protecting
oneself enough, Master?

148
00:10:51,282 --> 00:10:52,616
Well, I uh...

149
00:10:52,649 --> 00:10:53,682
(Yuichiro)
Hold on, Master!

150
00:10:53,716 --> 00:10:54,682
Huh?

151
00:10:54,716 --> 00:10:58,549
I am the instructor here!

152
00:10:58,582 --> 00:11:00,216
Yu-Yuichiro...

153
00:11:00,249 --> 00:11:03,082
But I'm your
instructor.

154
00:11:03,116 --> 00:11:04,782
Let's let
him decide!

155
00:11:04,816 --> 00:11:06,149
Yeah Grandpa.

156
00:11:06,182 --> 00:11:07,116
Hunh...

157
00:11:07,149 --> 00:11:09,582
Who should
I choose?

158
00:11:09,616 --> 00:11:14,716
If I pick Yuichiro,
I'll upset her. So
maybe I'll pick her.

159
00:11:14,749 --> 00:11:16,716
Master you
wouldn't!

160
00:11:16,749 --> 00:11:18,749
Make a
good choice.

161
00:11:18,782 --> 00:11:20,849
Grandpa!

162
00:11:20,882 --> 00:11:23,716
Uhh...

163
00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:29,182
There's nothing to think
about! Yuichiro's been
here with you a long time,
Grandpa!

164
00:11:29,216 --> 00:11:36,182
After all he's done,
you can't just toss
him aside?

165
00:11:36,216 --> 00:11:41,516
This isn't your decision
to make! So then what
do you say, big boy?

166
00:11:41,549 --> 00:11:43,516
It's me,
or her!

167
00:11:43,549 --> 00:11:44,749
[giggles]

168
00:11:47,949 --> 00:11:49,616
I pick her.

169
00:11:49,649 --> 00:11:51,216
You pick her?!

170
00:11:51,249 --> 00:11:52,749
How could you!

171
00:11:52,782 --> 00:11:54,949
C'mon, you can't
seriously mean
that!

172
00:11:54,982 --> 00:11:57,716
No, it's all right.

173
00:11:57,749 --> 00:11:58,882
[panicing]

174
00:11:58,916 --> 00:12:02,716
Hm! How dare you do
this to Yuichiro!
It makes no sense!

175
00:12:02,749 --> 00:12:04,716
That's where
you are wrong!

176
00:12:04,749 --> 00:12:06,949
[groans]

177
00:12:10,782 --> 00:12:12,516
Sailor Moon

00:12:12,549 --> 00:12:16,949

179
00:12:26,764 --> 00:12:31,764
Sailor Moon R!

180
00:12:35,579 --> 00:12:39,479
(Minako)
Ohh... So your grandpa
really did that to Yuichiro?

181
00:12:39,513 --> 00:12:45,313
You must feel like he let you
down. I know you care about
Yuichiro; what your Grandpa
did was mean.

182
00:12:45,346 --> 00:12:47,846
That's not really
what I'm angry about!

183
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:51,913
The most challenging
problems are always
the most satisfying
to resolve!

184
00:12:51,946 --> 00:12:56,046
Take this problem here.
It took me three hours
to find an answer.

185
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:58,413
Excuse me?

186
00:12:58,446 --> 00:13:02,479
So by the way Rei,
didn't you think
that new instructor
was weird?

187
00:13:02,513 --> 00:13:04,213
Mhm...

188
00:13:04,246 --> 00:13:06,913
Do you think
she could hurt
your grandpa?

189
00:13:06,946 --> 00:13:09,213
At the moment
I don't care what
happens to him!

190
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:11,846
'Kay, you're taking
this well Rei!

191
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:12,979
Ahh! Hot!

192
00:13:13,013 --> 00:13:14,546
Oh! You okay?

193
00:13:14,579 --> 00:13:15,679
Yeah.

194
00:13:15,713 --> 00:13:19,213
What's wrong? It's like your
mind's somewhere else today.

195
00:13:22,813 --> 00:13:24,413

My plan's working! If I can
keep spreading the Dark Power,
then Future Crystal Tokyo will
be destroyed.

204
00:13:51,346 --> 00:13:58,013
Girls oh no?! What's
going on here?! This
class was supposed
to be fun!

205
00:13:58,046 --> 00:14:00,546
Stop! Wait! Don't!

That's enough rough stuff!
Stop it, before somebody
really gets hurt!

You are indeed a master.
Dumbull, take Grandpa down.

00:14:37,413 --> 00:14:40,813

I warned you didn't I?
Now do you believe me?

235
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:26,213
What are you talking about?
You act like I'm an old man who
can't handle his own business!

236
00:15:26,246 --> 00:15:27,346
Huh?

00:15:27,379 --> 00:15:29,213

No, I won't!

just did that?!

You have crushed a slightly
lecherous old man's whole
reason for living!

00:17:24,446 --> 00:17:27,546
I'd say you've

I am the

I am Sailor Moon!

And now in the

I'll punish you!

It's really you!

It's fine to train oneself to
become strong, but I would've
hoped you'd still strive to
be graceful and kind.

Wait.

I think Mars can
handle this attack.

309
00:20:40,346 --> 00:20:43,246
She's very strong.

310
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:47,513
But I can't lose to her. Not
after the things she's done!

00:21:16,479 --> 00:21:22,279
Maybe I should go join the
Protection Aesthetics class
so I can become a strong and
pretty girl.

318
00:21:22,313 --> 00:21:24,746
[gasp]

319
00:21:32,446 --> 00:21:36,546
Suit yourself.
It's really not my
business what you do.

320
00:21:36,579 --> 00:21:38,913
Huh?

321
00:21:38,946 --> 00:21:40,179
Forgive me,
Usako.

322
00:21:40,213 --> 00:21:43,213
Ahh...

323
00:21:43,246 --> 00:21:48,079
The fact that he came to help
you proves that he does care
about you.

324
00:21:48,113 --> 00:21:49,046
Um-hm.

325
00:21:50,579 --> 00:21:55,146
(Usagi)
Aww so your grandpa is all done
with his Protection Aesthetics
class?

326
00:21:55,179 --> 00:21:59,246
(Rei)
Yeah, but now he's started
something called Protection
Jazz Dance!

327
00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:01,113
Protection Jazz?!

328
00:22:06,546 --> 00:22:11,813
Ha! This is so much
fun and it doesn't
hurt a bit! Ha-ha!

329
00:22:11,846 --> 00:22:16,779
And because I've got such
great moves, Master needs
me to help out after all!
Ha-ha-ha!

330
00:22:16,813 --> 00:22:20,046
I'm just gonna keep dancing
'til all those pretty girls
come back!

331
00:22:20,079 --> 00:22:23,479
Ughhh...

332
00:22:23,513 --> 00:22:29,013
And one, two, three, four!
Let's dance some more.
Ha-ha yeah!

333
00:24:11,351 --> 00:24:13,551
Daddy... Mommy!

334
00:24:13,584 --> 00:24:15,651
What's wrong, Chibi-Usa?
You don't look happy.

335
00:24:15,684 --> 00:24:18,584
An airhead like you wouldn't
understand my problems!

336
00:24:18,617 --> 00:24:19,717
How rude!

337
00:24:19,751 --> 00:24:22,151
I may not show it,
but I have my share
of worries too!

338
00:24:22,184 --> 00:24:24,251
There's Mamo,
there's my family,
and... huh?

339
00:24:24,284 --> 00:24:26,851
By the way,
where are your
parents, Chibi-Usa?

340
00:24:26,884 --> 00:24:32,684
Next time on Sailor Moon R:
"In Search of the Silver
Crystal: Chibi-Usa's Secret"

341
00:24:32,717 --> 00:24:35,955
The moonlight is a
messenger of love.
