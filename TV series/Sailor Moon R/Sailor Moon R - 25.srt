1
00:01:57,317 --> 00:02:01,688
Berthier! Using people
and deceiving them is no
way to live your life!

2
00:02:01,722 --> 00:02:06,460
Truly helping, loving,
and caring for other
people without expecting
something in return,

3
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:09,296
that's the way to fill
one's life with meaning.

4
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:12,366
Humans are born with the
power to love and care
for each other.

5
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:15,636
That's what you
need to understand!

6
00:02:23,777 --> 00:02:26,680
"For Friendship: Ami
Vs. Berthier."

7
00:02:28,515 --> 00:02:29,983
[groaning]

8
00:02:32,552 --> 00:02:34,121
Ehhhhh!

9
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:35,389
And checkmate!

10
00:02:35,455 --> 00:02:37,524
[groaning]

11
00:02:37,557 --> 00:02:39,693
You beat me again!

12
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:41,328
[giggling]

13
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:42,362
Wow, great game!

14
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:43,497
[groaning]

15
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:46,199
But I even studied
this guide to chess!

16
00:02:46,233 --> 00:02:50,537
Not only are you smart
when it comes to school
stuff, Ami, but you're an
ace chess player, as well.

17
00:02:50,604 --> 00:02:54,207
Chess is the perfect
mental game for developing
a calm demeanor and it

18
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:56,643
promotes the ability to
make precise decisions.

19
00:02:56,677 --> 00:03:01,782
Hear that? Calmness!
Precision! You couldn't
develop those things in
a hundred years!

20
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,617
Hmph! Hey, no
one asked you!

21
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:05,719
But you're right,
Ami is awesome!

22
00:03:05,752 --> 00:03:10,290
Well actually Ami was the
junior chess champion of
Japan, isn't that right?

23
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:12,092
That was just luck.

24
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:16,763
Well then let's all learn
to play chess from Ami
and that way we can all
be chess champions!

25
00:03:17,297 --> 00:03:20,701
Uh... I'm gonna pass
on that, I'm not really
good at being calm.

26
00:03:20,734 --> 00:03:25,672
Ha! Mm-hm! I know!
When it comes to being
calm, you're even worse
than I am, Mako!

27
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:28,508
Well... You didn't
have to agree with
me.

28
00:03:29,009 --> 00:03:32,612
Oh Usagi! Talk about
the pot calling the
kettle black...

29
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:35,015
Hey, do you wanna
play against me?

30
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:38,552
Why sure, but don't
expect me to go easy
on you. I'm gonna teach

31
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:40,520
you how to be a
gracious loser.

32
00:03:41,788 --> 00:03:43,290
Check mate!

33
00:03:43,457 --> 00:03:46,126
Whoa! Don't do that
yet we only just
started!

34
00:03:46,193 --> 00:03:48,628
Nope! When in battle
never show mercy.

35
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:49,596
[groaning]

36
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:51,531
Chibi-Usa, you're
really good!

37
00:03:51,531 --> 00:03:53,734
Hey sorry, I
gotta get going.

38
00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:56,570
Oh wow, look at the
time. I have something
to do too.

39
00:03:56,603 --> 00:03:58,505
Are you off to
do some studying?

40
00:03:58,538 --> 00:04:00,774
Mm-mm! I'm going
to the Chess Tower.

41
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:03,009
The Chess Tower?

42
00:04:03,143 --> 00:04:04,745
You look just lovely!

43
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:06,113
You really think so?

44
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,281
Hmph! Pathetic!

45
00:04:08,648 --> 00:04:11,284
And thank you so much
for your purchase!

46
00:04:11,518 --> 00:04:14,321
She has brought disgrace
to the Four Spectre Sisters.

47
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:17,290
Hi! Would you like
to try some new
makeup?

48
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:19,326
I don't understand...

49
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:24,264
Why would Koan want to
become an ordinary human
being in the first place?

50
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:26,767
I couldn't care
less what motivates
a traitor.

51
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,269
She's no longer
our younger sister.

52
00:04:29,302 --> 00:04:32,339
Our clan has no use
for traitors like her.

53
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:35,075
I suppose you're right.

54
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:43,583
[gasp]

55
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:50,190
We'll figure out how
to rid ourselves of
that traitor later on.

56
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:56,997
Right now I want to show
you the location of the new
Crystal Point I found.

57
00:04:57,197 --> 00:04:58,598
The Chess Tower...

58
00:05:00,167 --> 00:05:03,136
Please Master Rubeus,
I'll handle this one!

59
00:05:03,737 --> 00:05:06,473
Berthier seemed quite
anxious to go...

60
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:10,544
There's nothing wrong
with that. If she does
well, we'll help her
finish the job.

61
00:05:10,577 --> 00:05:11,645
Of course.

62
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:13,246
Make sure you succeed.

63
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,214
Yessir!

64
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:20,387
Hnh! Exactly. Succeed and
you will continue to work
for me until I no longer
have a use for you.

65
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:25,492
After all, you're all
nothing more than expendable
pawns, here to protect the
king, me!

66
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:30,564
Huh? This building has
a shape I've seen
somewhere before.

67
00:05:30,597 --> 00:05:32,499
It kinda looks
like a cake...

68
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:33,433
[giggling]

69
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,635
It's not a cake,
it's shaped like
a rook.

70
00:05:35,635 --> 00:05:37,003
A rook?

71
00:05:37,037 --> 00:05:40,373
I know this one!
A rook's that chess
piece that looks like
a castle!

72
00:05:40,407 --> 00:05:43,476
You see, this
building's owner is
a huge chess fan.

73
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,378
Ohh...

74
00:05:45,412 --> 00:05:49,216
As a matter of fact, this
Sunday, as a part of the
grand opening ceremony for
this Chess Tower, the

75
00:05:49,249 --> 00:05:51,651
World Chess Tournament
is going to be held here.

76
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:54,354
So I guess you must
be signed up for that
tournament, right?

77
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:56,656
If you entered, you'd
be sure to win it!

78
00:05:56,756 --> 00:06:02,495
I did sign up, because
I enjoy playing chess. But
it isn't that important to
me if I win or lose.

79
00:06:02,596 --> 00:06:04,731
But winning is important...

80
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:08,535
Competing when you don't
care about winning is a
waste of time.

81
00:06:08,602 --> 00:06:11,304
Winning this tournament
is what it's all about.

82
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:13,707
Excuse me, but,
who are you?

83
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:14,708
[giggling]

84
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:19,446
It's not whether you
win or lose, what really
matters is that you try
to do your best.

85
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:22,215
That's exactly what
losers always say!

86
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:23,316
[groaning]

87
00:06:24,985 --> 00:06:28,588
Ahha! Silly girls, go
play your little chess
games, cause you'll
never lear anything

88
00:06:28,622 --> 00:06:30,991
about being a winner
in the game of life.

89
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,626
You're being kinda
rude, you know...

90
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:36,062
Oh, did I hurt your
feelings? Well we'll
just have to play some

91
00:06:36,096 --> 00:06:38,298
chess to prove my
point. See ya!

92
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:41,134
Boy is that girl
stuck up!

93
00:06:41,201 --> 00:06:42,135
What a snob!

94
00:06:50,043 --> 00:06:52,045
Ohh, Ami!
Is that you?

95
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:52,545
Huh?

96
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:54,314
It's been awhile!

97
00:06:54,381 --> 00:06:55,582
Yes it has!

98
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,985
What a beautiful
piece of work this
building is!

99
00:06:59,052 --> 00:07:03,456
Why thank you! So I
take it you'll be playing
in the chess tournament
Sunday?

100
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:04,658
Yes.

101
00:07:04,691 --> 00:07:07,060
Well for old time's
sake, what do you say
we play a game?

102
00:07:09,329 --> 00:07:10,463
Sure!

103
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:16,636
Y'know, I used to
play chess with your
grandfather all the
time.

104
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:17,504
Oh!

105
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:20,106
You know, Ami, you
seem a bit different.

106
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:21,007
Huh?

107
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:26,046
What I mean is, the
Ami I knew years ago
played chess to keep
herself from feeling

108
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:29,049
lonely. But now you
seem so much more...

109
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:32,786
That's because now
I have friends...

110
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:38,224
How nice. I'm glad to
hear it. Good friends
are more precious than
any other treasure.

111
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,226
Yes, I think
so as well.

112
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:42,228
Check!

113
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:44,965
Um, Ami...

114
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:49,602
Just between you and me,
would you mind holding
off on that kind of move?

115
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:50,503
[chuckling]

116
00:07:50,537 --> 00:07:52,339
You haven't changed
a bit!

117
00:07:52,505 --> 00:07:55,709
I forgot what a
lovely smile you
have.

118
00:07:57,777 --> 00:08:01,581
Um... Does your
receptionist get
off at six today?

119
00:08:01,748 --> 00:08:06,086
She does. You and I
should be the only
ones left here on
this floor.

120
00:08:06,186 --> 00:08:09,689
Then would you mind
terribly if I took
a look around the
facility?

121
00:08:09,723 --> 00:08:10,790
Be my guest.

122
00:08:10,857 --> 00:08:11,691
[chuckle]

123
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:12,692
Thank you, sir!

124
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:15,261
Mmm!

125
00:08:15,295 --> 00:08:18,365
This room is the exact
center of the Crystal
Point!

126
00:08:18,398 --> 00:08:21,601
Dark Water!

127
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,105
Stop that!

128
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:26,006
Hm?

129
00:08:27,207 --> 00:08:29,709
Wait, that's one of
the silly girls from
earlier, isn't it?

130
00:08:30,043 --> 00:08:32,045
Leave now,
or else...

131
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:33,213
Hmph!

132
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:38,251
You're brave, but there's
no way you can stop me by
yourself. I'm way too
powerful.

133
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:43,423
Besides, I can't stand
goody-goody girls like
you and your stupid
friends. So...

134
00:08:43,623 --> 00:08:45,025
Go to hell!

135
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:46,693
[screaming]

136
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:51,698
I wouldn't suggest
you try to stand up.

137
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:53,600
Because if you do...

138
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,235
[screaming]

139
00:08:56,169 --> 00:08:58,338
Oh sorry, did
that hurt?

140
00:08:58,605 --> 00:09:03,443
Well, don't worry.
Next time I hit you
like that, you probably
won't feel a thing.

141
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:06,346
Muh...
Mercury...

142
00:09:07,781 --> 00:09:12,619
Mercury Star Power!
Make Up!

143
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:35,575
Oh my, what a surprise!
You're Sailor Mercury,
one of the Sailor
Guardians!

144
00:09:35,642 --> 00:09:38,578
Master Rubeus will be
so please when he
hears this.

145
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:47,420
Shine Aqua Illusion!

146
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:54,260
Well! How dare you
interfere with my
work!

147
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:59,099
Sparkling Wide Pressure!

148
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:01,568
Ow!

149
00:10:02,569 --> 00:10:03,970
That hurt!

150
00:10:05,238 --> 00:10:08,408
You know three against
one isn't fair. It's
actually cheating!

151
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,276
And you didn't have
to be so rough!

152
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:13,279
Why don't you stop
whining and tell us
what you're doing here!

153
00:10:13,413 --> 00:10:16,583
I've had enough for
today, but I swear
you'll pay for this!

154
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:18,685
Guys, there's
a problem!

155
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,353
Why? What
happened?

156
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,289
Berthier knows who I
am when I'm not a
Guardian.

157
00:10:23,323 --> 00:10:23,990
Huh?!

158
00:10:25,258 --> 00:10:28,194
I had to transform
right in front of her.
I couldn't help it.

159
00:10:28,261 --> 00:10:32,165
Well if her target is
the Chess Tower, she'll
be back and we'll deal
with her then.

160
00:10:32,265 --> 00:10:34,567
Don't you worry about
it! It'll work out!

161
00:10:35,602 --> 00:10:37,070
Thanks, Sailor Moon.

162
00:10:40,006 --> 00:10:42,342
Oww, she scratched
my hand.

163
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:46,513
The nerve of those creeps.
That blast could have
scarred my alabaster skin!

164
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:48,314
Oh, did you get hurt?

165
00:10:48,348 --> 00:10:50,583
Aww, looks like
you did!

166
00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:53,419
I-! The three of
them attacked me
at once!

167
00:10:53,453 --> 00:10:55,088
But you fought them
back, right?

168
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:56,523
Your palm's bleeding.

169
00:10:56,589 --> 00:10:58,992
They still didn't stop
you from succeeding in
your mission, did they?

170
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:00,493
Of course not!

171
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:03,596
That's what we thought!
Because if you have
failed after volunteering

172
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:06,766
to go, then there's no
way you'd have the guts
to come back.

173
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:09,802
If I failed, I think
I'd probably kill
myself.

174
00:11:09,802 --> 00:11:15,141
Well, even if somehow I
had failed, I wouldn't
dream of asking my older
sisters to help out.

175
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:17,076
What a relief that
you didn't have to.

176
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:20,680
One disappointing
embarrassment like
Koan's failure is
quite enough.

177
00:11:20,713 --> 00:11:23,583
[laughing]

178
00:11:33,226 --> 00:11:35,728
Sailor Moon R!

179
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:51,511
Sailor Moon R!

180
00:11:56,649 --> 00:12:03,323
So Ami, or should I say
Sailor Mercury. It's time
to settle this over your
favorite game.

181
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:06,226
A serious game
of chess...

182
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:11,397
[chuckling]

183
00:12:15,802 --> 00:12:18,738
I'm here to compete
in the World Chess
Tournament.

184
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:21,040
Of course! May I
please have your
name?

185
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:23,543
Let's see, what
should I call
myself?

186
00:12:23,543 --> 00:12:24,310
Huh?

187
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:27,447
I haven't decided
my name yet.

188
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,589
The competition's
that way...

189
00:12:36,623 --> 00:12:37,557
Thanks!

190
00:12:46,065 --> 00:12:47,400
This is exciting!

191
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,134
Yeah!

192
00:12:49,736 --> 00:12:51,371
Hey! Ami won again!

193
00:12:51,404 --> 00:12:53,539
Wouldn't it be great
if Ami wins it all!

194
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:54,440
Yeah.

195
00:12:54,474 --> 00:12:56,643
Okay everyone, ready
for a chess cheer?!

196
00:12:57,210 --> 00:13:02,782
Go! Go! Ami girl!
Do your best and
rule the world!

197
00:13:05,318 --> 00:13:06,319
Usagi!

198
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:08,454
I say there...

199
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:11,224
Oh, I'm sorry!
Were we getting
too loud?

200
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:14,460
No, you're fine.
Are you girls all
friends of Ami?

201
00:13:15,228 --> 00:13:16,229
Yes!

202
00:13:17,664 --> 00:13:20,733
I see! So you must be
the good friends she
was telling me about
earlier.

203
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,802
You know her, too?
Who are you?

204
00:13:22,835 --> 00:13:26,506
I'm the rich, eccentric
old man who built this
Chess Tower.

205
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:28,341
Whoa! So you're
the owner!

206
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:29,609
Mm-hm!

207
00:13:29,609 --> 00:13:32,111
So do you think Ami has
a chance of winning
this tournament?

208
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:34,647
I'd say it depends
on her opponents.

209
00:13:35,214 --> 00:13:39,052
So, she won again.
That girl is quite
good.

210
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:43,990
Ah! Berthier, my big
sister! What is she
doing here, competing
in this tournament?

211
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:46,059
All right!

212
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:48,294
Ami's awesome!
I hope she wins
this!

213
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:50,730
I bet she gets
through this round
no problem!

214
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:54,033
Wow! That same
girl won again!

215
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:57,003
Yeah, the old guy
was right! She
really is good!

216
00:13:58,271 --> 00:14:00,239
Hey! It's down to
the final two!

217
00:14:00,273 --> 00:14:03,343
Oh, Ami's playing that
girl for the chess
championship.

218
00:14:03,443 --> 00:14:05,778
Let's have a fun
match, shall we?

219
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,180
[giggling]

220
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:08,681
[gasp]

221
00:14:09,282 --> 00:14:10,550
Her hand's as
cold as ice!

222
00:14:11,718 --> 00:14:13,052
[giggling]

223
00:14:13,086 --> 00:14:16,189
I'll use this chess
game to crush you and
fill this entire building

224
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:19,258
with Dark Power. Now
that will be fun...

225
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:21,594
To the finals!

226
00:14:21,728 --> 00:14:25,431
For this match, I'd
like to use these
playing pieces.

227
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:27,200
They're lovely...

228
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,602
Oh they're more
than just lovely.

229
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:30,002
[giggling]

230
00:14:30,002 --> 00:14:30,703
What?!

231
00:14:30,737 --> 00:14:31,671
[giggling]

232
00:14:31,771 --> 00:14:34,006
What is Berthier
up to?

233
00:14:38,745 --> 00:14:41,013
She is good.

234
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:44,283
Oh! Ami lost
another piece!

235
00:14:44,584 --> 00:14:45,618
C'mon, Ami!

236
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:47,353
[giggling]

237
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,629
What's the matter?
It's time for your
move.

238
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:57,530
[gasp]

239
00:14:57,764 --> 00:14:58,731
I got it!

240
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:04,237
Yeah! Ami turned
the tables on her!

241
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:05,071
[gasp]

242
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:07,273
Check mate!

243
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:08,441
Ami did it!

244
00:15:09,442 --> 00:15:13,146
Oh no. This match
isn't over. We're
not done!

245
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:14,113
Huh?!

246
00:15:14,981 --> 00:15:17,517
The game has just
begun, Sailor Mercury.

247
00:15:17,817 --> 00:15:18,584
[gasp]

248
00:15:20,186 --> 00:15:22,288
I've had enough
playing around!

249
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:27,427
There's nothing
to see here!

250
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:30,530
[gasps]

251
00:15:31,531 --> 00:15:32,432
There must be some
problem with the
camera.

252
00:15:32,465 --> 00:15:34,600
That sounds right!
We'll go check it out!

253
00:15:35,134 --> 00:15:36,502
Koan, stay here!

254
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:41,307
Moon Crystal Power...

255
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:50,583
Mars Star Power...

256
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:55,254
Jupiter Star Power...

257
00:15:57,657 --> 00:16:00,493
Venus Star Power...

258
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:04,497
Make Up!

259
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:39,432
I should've known
it was you!

260
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:41,167
Stop right there!

261
00:16:42,635 --> 00:16:46,138
You're not ready to
challenge Ami in chess
or anything else for
that matter!

262
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:48,474
Cheating and lying
aren't the way to
succeed in life!

263
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:53,246
So now, in the name
of the moon, I'll
punish you!

264
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,314
Silly girls...

265
00:16:56,148 --> 00:16:57,517
[screams]

266
00:16:58,317 --> 00:16:59,685
What did you do?

267
00:16:59,819 --> 00:17:02,788
Death is the only
cure for fools like
them!

268
00:17:02,822 --> 00:17:08,160
Now, Sailor Mercury,
let's play another
titillating game of
chess together!

269
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:09,795
They'll die if
you don't.

270
00:17:09,896 --> 00:17:12,398
This is awful!
It's freezing!

271
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:13,833
It's no use!

272
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,568
We're trapped in
this deep freeze!

273
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:17,436
So, have you made
up your mind yet?

274
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:19,305
Alright then,
let's play!

275
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:23,109
Good, that's smart and
since you're smart, I'll
need a small advantage.

276
00:17:25,745 --> 00:17:27,647
Wait! That's cheating!

277
00:17:27,747 --> 00:17:28,714
[giggling]

278
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:31,317
You better think fast
or it'll be a checkmate!

279
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:34,720
Oh, what a shame!

280
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:37,456
[gasp]

281
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:42,228
Oh wait, I forgot! If
you lose a chess piece
while playing with my
specially made pieces,

282
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:44,330
your body will
slowly freeze up.

283
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:45,665
Sailor Mercury!

284
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:46,766
Hang in there!

285
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,200
We have faith in you!

286
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:50,469
Believe in yourself!
We know you can do it!

287
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:54,273
Just know that if you
forfeit this match,
I will spare your life.

288
00:17:54,307 --> 00:17:56,208
No! Let's play on!

289
00:17:56,475 --> 00:18:00,112
Oh! You might be a
bigger fool than I
thought.

290
00:18:03,516 --> 00:18:05,284
No! Save yourself!

291
00:18:05,318 --> 00:18:06,619
Get away! Run!

292
00:18:06,619 --> 00:18:08,387
This has gone
to far!

293
00:18:08,788 --> 00:18:12,224
Burning...

294
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:18,297
Mandala!

295
00:18:18,464 --> 00:18:20,066
[screaming]

296
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:21,200
Are you trying
to kill us?!

297
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:22,435
I'm sorry!

298
00:18:22,802 --> 00:18:23,436
Check.

299
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:24,437
[giggle]

300
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:26,606
[sigh]

301
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:32,211
There's no point in
being a martyr. It's
crazy to die trying to
protect those strangers.

302
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:32,945
[chuckling]

303
00:18:33,646 --> 00:18:35,314
That's where
you're wrong...

304
00:18:35,348 --> 00:18:36,048
Huh?

305
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:39,018
They're not strangers,
they're my friends!

306
00:18:40,019 --> 00:18:41,153
You're friends?

307
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:44,724
All my dear friends
are very important
to me.

308
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:48,127
Even if it costs me
my life, I would
protect them!

309
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,663
Hnnh! Stop trying
to stall for more
time.

310
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:52,732
Nicely done,
Berthier.

311
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:55,001
Now we can help
you finish her
off.

312
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:59,205
I can't believe you're
going to take the credit
for my hard work!

313
00:18:59,271 --> 00:19:03,175
But the three of us work
as a team, the Three
Spectre Sisters!

314
00:19:03,209 --> 00:19:06,045
Right. We should share
the credit for this win.

315
00:19:06,412 --> 00:19:07,279
Check!

316
00:19:08,748 --> 00:19:09,548
[gasp]

317
00:19:09,849 --> 00:19:11,517
Oh! So it's you!

318
00:19:11,684 --> 00:19:12,551
Check!

319
00:19:14,687 --> 00:19:15,688
[gasp]

320
00:19:16,555 --> 00:19:17,456
[screaming]

321
00:19:18,257 --> 00:19:19,425
Oww!

322
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:23,529
Someone who doesn't
know what it's like
to be a pawn has no
right...

323
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:26,532
...to try to move
the queen! Farewell!

324
00:19:27,233 --> 00:19:28,000
[gasp]

325
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:28,901
I need your help!

326
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:31,437
It looks like you're
plan failed, Berthier!

327
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:35,508
Right! And you should
make amends for your
failure by giving up
your life!

328
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:36,509
Do what's right!

329
00:19:40,046 --> 00:19:42,048
[crying]

330
00:19:42,081 --> 00:19:43,582
[laughing]

331
00:19:43,616 --> 00:19:47,520
You see? Even among real
sisters, there's no such
thing as caring for
someone.

332
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:51,223
That's why it's absolute
nonsense that you would
risk your life to protect

333
00:19:51,257 --> 00:19:53,726
a friend, a stranger,
or anyone!

334
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:58,364
You're all looking at
me like you feel so
sorry for me. Go on,
laugh.

335
00:19:58,397 --> 00:20:05,271
Even I think it's funny
that I was counting on
my sisters to help me.
The joke's on... Me...

336
00:20:05,738 --> 00:20:07,339
I said laugh!

337
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:12,945
Dark Water Full Power!
I'm going to take you
all with me!

338
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,949
[panicked breaths]

339
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:20,453
Every human being is
born alone and they
die alone!

340
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:24,423
And all this talk
about love! No one
needs love!

341
00:20:24,457 --> 00:20:27,059
Stop it! Don't do
this sister!

342
00:20:27,093 --> 00:20:30,596
Koan, have you come
here to shame me
like the others?

343
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:34,633
Listen to me- Ah!
You are not alone!

344
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:39,505
A sister like you who
betrayed us, could nevr
understand the pain
that I'm feeling!

345
00:20:39,505 --> 00:20:41,173
That's not
true, sister!

346
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:46,045
I do understand you!
I know your heart and
your loneliness!

347
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:47,513
You can't understand!

348
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:48,714
[screaming]

349
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:50,382
Koan!

350
00:20:50,516 --> 00:20:53,185
I beg you! Don't die!

351
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:57,523
Humans have-
[groaning]

352
00:20:57,523 --> 00:21:01,460
All humans possess a
deep nurturing love!

353
00:21:01,494 --> 00:21:02,762
I've seen it!

354
00:21:04,864 --> 00:21:06,699
You have?

355
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:14,073
Will I be able to
see that love, as
well?

356
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,511
Bertheir!

357
00:21:21,647 --> 00:21:25,451
Koan, are you
crying? Are
you hurt?

358
00:21:25,484 --> 00:21:29,021
No! I'm just happy!

359
00:21:29,588 --> 00:21:31,423
I'm so sorry, Koan!

360
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:33,626
I love you,
big sister!

361
00:21:44,236 --> 00:21:49,175
Moon Crystal Power!

362
00:21:55,181 --> 00:21:57,416
Refresh!

363
00:22:02,755 --> 00:22:03,656
[giggling]

364
00:22:05,558 --> 00:22:06,525
Thank goodness!

365
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,327
Yes! Thank you all!

366
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,662
Let's go home, guys.

367
00:22:15,301 --> 00:22:17,469
Oh! Could you not
make that move?

368
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:20,573
Even though we're
sisters, I'm not
gonna go easy on
you.

369
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,308
Uh...

370
00:22:22,308 --> 00:22:24,810
Hey! No fair! You
were using an extra
Queen!

371
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:27,379
C'mon, I need all
the help I can get.

372
00:22:27,413 --> 00:22:28,247
Why you-!

373
00:22:28,314 --> 00:22:29,982
[giggling]

374
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:31,550
I love you, sister!

375
00:24:09,148 --> 00:24:11,283
Sailor Moon!

376
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:14,787
Why is it that you
sisters must fight
one another?!

377
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:17,623
Because for a traitor,
there is only death.

378
00:24:17,623 --> 00:24:21,226
They may be my younger
sisters, but I will
show no mercy.

379
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:25,664
Petz! Calaveras! Open
you eyes! Can't you see
Rubeus is manipulating
you!

380
00:24:25,698 --> 00:24:29,601
If you dare to defy
our clan. You will
die!

381
00:24:30,035 --> 00:24:35,140
Next time on Sailor Moon R:
"Rubeus the Heartless: The
Tragic Sisters."

382
00:24:35,174 --> 00:24:37,676
The moonlight is a
messenger of love.
