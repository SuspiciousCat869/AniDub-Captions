1
00:01:57,117 --> 00:02:02,189
So what if I'm a silly, dumb,
flat chested, lazy, and clumsy
goofball!

2
00:02:02,322 --> 00:02:06,360
I'm used to being called those
things. But I'm not used to what
you're calling Ami!

3
00:02:06,493 --> 00:02:10,364
And spreading rumors that Ami
cheated on her tests is totally
unforgivable!

4
00:02:10,664 --> 00:02:15,636
I am Sailor Moon! In the name of
the Moon, I'll punish you!

00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:25,646
[Sighs]

6
00:02:27,547 --> 00:02:30,684
My body is just so gorgeous.

7
00:02:31,385 --> 00:02:37,365
And I'm making it even more
gorgeous by immersing it in this
wonderful jasmine bath oil.

8
00:02:38,065 --> 00:02:42,036
My darling Prince Demande just
loves the scent of jasmine.

9
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:45,439
Esmeraude, time to get out.

10
00:02:47,008 --> 00:02:51,045
Really, Saphir? I think it's
very rude to spy on a woman
while she's bathing.

11
00:02:51,178 --> 00:02:56,183
Get over it. As you well know,
we must complete the Dark Gate
as soon as possible.

12
00:02:56,373 --> 00:03:02,336
I shouldn't need to remind you,
we have to send the power of the
Malefic Black Crystal into the
Juban District and destroy it.

13
00:03:02,552 --> 00:03:05,121
And here you are, taking a bath
instead.

14
00:03:05,254 --> 00:03:07,557
[Laughing]

15
00:03:07,623 --> 00:03:13,296
My plan for all that is moving
forward even as I bathe. So
don't tell me what I have to do.

16
00:03:13,496 --> 00:03:14,430
Really?

17
00:03:15,798 --> 00:03:20,336
The newest Negative Point is the
Juban District's Eisai Cram
school!

18
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:34,250

[Evil Laughter]

You see that? The Henge is
already growing with Dark Power.

24
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:22,678
By tomorrow evening the Dark
Henge will be completed. I want
you to defend this point until
then.

25
00:04:22,812 --> 00:04:24,347

00:04:40,896 --> 00:04:43,499
I'm so impressed! Wow Ami,
that's great!

30
00:04:43,966 --> 00:04:46,402
You're at the top of our whole
class again!

31
00:04:46,502 --> 00:04:49,505
You got everything right except
one, you're a genius!

32
00:04:49,638 --> 00:04:54,043
Oh, that's not really true. All
the things I studied just
happened to be on the test.

33
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:57,013
It must be so nice to
always be the best.

34
00:04:57,179 --> 00:04:59,548
All you do is study.
How dull.

35
00:04:59,682 --> 00:05:03,886
It shouldn't come as any great
surprise that the boys call you
a nerd behind your back.

36
00:05:05,721 --> 00:05:06,589
[Sighs]

37
00:05:06,756 --> 00:05:08,090
How rude!

38
00:05:10,126 --> 00:05:15,031
Don't pay any attention to what
those girls say. They're just
jealous because you're smarter
than they are.

39
00:05:15,631 --> 00:05:18,968
Thanks, Usagi. I should be
used to this stuff by now.

40
00:05:19,135 --> 00:05:21,704
Yeah, I know what you mean.

41
00:05:22,805 --> 00:05:25,908
They all laugh cause my grades
are so bad. [Embarrassed
Chuckle]

42
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:30,613
I found this cheat sheet with
all the test answers in Mizuno's
desk!

43
00:05:30,746 --> 00:05:31,414
Huh?

44
00:05:32,715 --> 00:05:35,017
So Mizuno got a perfect score
because she cheated on the test.

45
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:36,052
I knew it!

46
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:41,757
She's probably been cheating
all along on every test and
that's the real reason she
always gets the best grades.

47
00:05:43,192 --> 00:05:45,728
[Angry Grunting]

48
00:05:46,062 --> 00:05:49,532
I've always wondered if she
buries her head in books just to
look intelligent.

49
00:05:49,598 --> 00:05:53,035
I mean how smart can she
possibly be, she hangs out with
Usagi all the time.

50
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:57,406
That's right! Usagi is a
goofball she couldn't get a
good grade if she tried!

51
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:58,808
[Gasp]

52
00:06:00,476 --> 00:06:03,846
Hey, Tsukino! You and your
friends hang with Mizuno. What's
your opinion?

53
00:06:04,013 --> 00:06:08,451
Don't you think it's weird she's
at the top of the class while
you're stuck at the bottom
permanently.

54
00:06:08,818 --> 00:06:12,922
It's not weird! Ami's really
smart and she studies harder
than anyone!

55
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:15,825
That's right. What is wrong
with you, Umino?

56
00:06:16,258 --> 00:06:18,527
Picking on Ami! You're not
acting normal.

57
00:06:18,861 --> 00:06:22,164
Sounds to me like you've decided
to take the side of a dirty
cheater!

58
00:06:22,698 --> 00:06:23,933
We don't like it!

59
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:24,834
Back off!

60
00:06:26,435 --> 00:06:28,938
Are you defending this cheater,
too? If that's your problem, I'm
ready to fix it!

Mako, stop! You're gonna
get in trouble!

67
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:40,983
Huh?

68
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:44,453
That one boy did grab her, and
the other two looked pretty
mean.

69
00:06:46,288 --> 00:06:48,457
They were accusing you of
cheating! Did you want me to
just let them get away with
that?

70
00:06:48,524 --> 00:06:51,093
It's okay, because I know I'm
innocent.

71
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,596
Yes you are! We believe you!

72
00:06:53,662 --> 00:06:54,463
Mhmm.

73
00:06:54,597 --> 00:06:55,965
I appreciate it.

74
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:02,571
But what really bothers me the
most is how did I end up getting
that one question wrong? I was
so close to a perfect score!

75
00:07:02,705 --> 00:07:04,039
Oh boy!

76
00:07:07,209 --> 00:07:11,080
I can't get over the fact that
Umino and those others were
badmouthing Ami.

77
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:15,084
Yeah, they aren't the usual
students who go around doing
that sort of thing.

78
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:18,020
But I know they all go to Eisai
Cram School together.

79
00:07:18,654 --> 00:07:23,826
[Heavy Breathing] Hey, is it
true Ami gets good grades
because she's a cheater?

80
00:07:23,893 --> 00:07:24,493
Huh?

81
00:07:25,494 --> 00:07:27,029
That guy who wears round
swirly glasses says so.

angry!

I'm gonna wring his neck!

00:07:35,871 --> 00:07:38,941
Usagi. Mako. It's alright.

86
00:07:39,675 --> 00:07:44,680
At the end of the day, I know
you two will never believe that.
And that's good enough for me.

00:07:51,654 --> 00:07:53,989
She won't admit it, but she's
taking it badly.

I wish there was something
we could do.

90
00:08:04,667 --> 00:08:06,435
There goes the cheater.

91
00:08:07,836 --> 00:08:10,639
She really needs to change her
status from best student to best
cheater!

92
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:14,076
She just faked all that
studying! What a fraud!

00:08:38,767 --> 00:08:39,935
Huh?

99
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:44,907
But I know they all go to
Eisai Cram School together.

100
00:08:44,974 --> 00:08:50,613
Wait, is it more than a
coincidence that Umino and the
others spreading rumors go to
that school?

101

you work for Esmeraude, where
are you hiding?

I'm here now and it's filled
with Dark Power!

we'll be right there!

thought. I guess I'm going to
have to try something else.

that?

you're about to find out what

carry out their latest plan.

I'm sure that Umino and the
others suddenly became so mean
because they were exposed to
their Dark Power.

explain it.

look at yourself?!

out your skin tone.

up in studying all the time.

00:12:47,461 --> 00:12:50,898
I am so tired of hearing you
talk about your studying and
brag about your good grades. It
makes me want to throw up!

153
00:12:51,165 --> 00:12:55,936
What can I say? I study a lot,
but never thought I was bragging
about my grades.

154
00:12:56,003 --> 00:12:59,139
I apologize to each of you for
my thoughtless behavior.

155
00:12:59,406 --> 00:13:02,576
Oh, please Miss
goodie-two-shoes, I don't
believe you!

156
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:03,911
[Grunt]

157
00:13:05,646 --> 00:13:09,183
This can't be happening! There's
no way my friends would say
these things to me!

158
00:13:09,383 --> 00:13:13,087
I'm making you hate them. And
when you've had enough you're
gonna crush them!

159
00:13:13,354 --> 00:13:15,222
Sailor Mercury! What's wrong?

160
00:13:18,025 --> 00:13:19,593
Sailor Mercury! We hate you!

161
00:13:20,527 --> 00:13:21,528
[Grunts]

162
00:13:21,695 --> 00:13:23,630
[Gasps] A Dark Henge!

163
00:13:23,697 --> 00:13:24,999
And a Droid too!

164
00:13:26,066 --> 00:13:30,838
Moon Crystal Power Make Up!

165
00:14:09,243 --> 00:14:14,214
Go ahead, Sailor Mercury. Kill
those bad mouthing girls before
they kill you!

166
00:14:14,281 --> 00:14:15,449
Hold it right there!

167
00:14:15,582 --> 00:14:17,251
What? Who the hell are you?!

168
00:14:18,085 --> 00:14:21,455
I am the Pretty Guardian who
fights for love and for justice!

169
00:14:21,588 --> 00:14:23,323
I am Sailor Moon!

170
00:14:23,624 --> 00:14:26,293
Hmph! So the last one of you
finally shows up!

171
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:29,029
You have filled this Cram school
with Dark Power...

172
00:14:29,096 --> 00:14:33,033
...infecting the minds
of students with animosity,
so they say spiteful things!

173
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,902
That is unforgivable!

174
00:14:34,968 --> 00:14:35,903
[Chuckles]

175
00:14:37,271 --> 00:14:41,075
And now in the name of the Moon,
I'll punish you!

176
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:42,276
I'm so scared!

177
00:14:42,409 --> 00:14:44,411
Hallucination Giwark!

178
00:14:46,113 --> 00:14:48,482
You've got to get out of
the way, Sailor Moon!

179
00:14:48,582 --> 00:14:50,084
[Screams]

180
00:14:50,918 --> 00:14:52,486
What just happened?

181
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,589
You're so dumb, Sailor Moon.

182
00:14:55,656 --> 00:14:57,291
Flat Chested too!

183
00:14:57,424 --> 00:14:59,560
A clumsy idiot!

184
00:14:59,626 --> 00:15:01,628
You suck at everything!

185
00:15:02,129 --> 00:15:03,497
[Sigh]

186
00:15:04,298 --> 00:15:06,633
[Crying]

187
00:15:07,434 --> 00:15:08,635
[Giggles]

188
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:14,441
Yeah! So what? I'm a dumb, flat
chested, clumsy idiot who sucks
at everything! Who cares?!

189
00:15:14,508 --> 00:15:15,442
[Gasps]

190
00:15:16,677 --> 00:15:19,046
That won't work on me, I'm used
to people calling me names!

191
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:22,149
Giwark! That is some twisted
personality!

192
00:15:22,649 --> 00:15:25,185
I'm just gonna take that as a
compliment.

193
00:15:25,319 --> 00:15:27,888
Let's see how you like this!

194
00:15:28,155 --> 00:15:29,556
[Screams]

195
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:31,291
[Gasps]

196
00:15:32,059 --> 00:15:34,995
[Screams]
[Grunts]

197
00:15:35,863 --> 00:15:37,264
That hurt!

198
00:15:37,464 --> 00:15:38,799
Giwark!

199
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:41,335
Sailor Moon!

200
00:15:41,468 --> 00:15:42,336
[Gasps]

201
00:15:43,437 --> 00:15:44,204
[Grunts]

202
00:15:47,207 --> 00:15:49,143
[Gasps] Tuxedo Mask!

203
00:15:51,445 --> 00:15:55,182
You have attacked and toyed with
the innocent minds of young
teenagers, by planting a Dark
Henge in a Cram school...

204
00:15:55,315 --> 00:15:59,153
...their trusted place, where
students prepare for the high
school entrance exams.

205
00:15:59,353 --> 00:16:02,890
I won't forgive a Droid as evil
as you are!

206
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:04,958
[Grunts] Don't interfere!

207
00:16:06,059 --> 00:16:07,060
[Grunts]

208
00:16:07,127 --> 00:16:07,594
[Grunts]

[Screams]

214
00:16:15,068 --> 00:16:16,904
[Gasps] Tuxedo Mask! You okay?

215
00:16:17,271 --> 00:16:18,906
[Grunting]

216
00:16:20,374 --> 00:16:23,544
Be sure to watch closely as
Sailor Mercury kills all her
other ex-friends.

217
00:16:24,244 --> 00:16:27,114
Hallucination! Giwark Power Up!

218
00:16:29,016 --> 00:16:30,551
Mercury!
[Grunts]

219
00:16:30,617 --> 00:16:32,052
Are you okay?

220
00:16:35,389 --> 00:16:40,561
Sailor Mercury! Ami Mizuno! You
cheated on all your tests!

221
00:16:41,195 --> 00:16:42,563
[Wincing]

222
00:16:42,629 --> 00:16:45,399
You're nothing more than a
disgusting cheater!

223
00:16:45,532 --> 00:16:46,833
Yeah you are!

224
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,835
[Wincing]

225
00:16:49,236 --> 00:16:50,337
Mercury!

226
00:16:50,404 --> 00:16:51,171
What is it?

227
00:16:51,238 --> 00:16:51,838
What's wrong?

228
00:16:52,539 --> 00:16:54,208
Ami Mizuno, you big cheater!

229
00:16:54,675 --> 00:16:55,842
You're disgusting!

230
00:16:55,909 --> 00:16:57,377
Cheater, you're a fraud!

231
00:16:58,045 --> 00:16:59,546
Ami Mizuno, you cheat!

232
00:16:59,613 --> 00:17:01,949
Cheater! I'm tired of you
cheating!

233
00:17:02,015 --> 00:17:04,651
All you've ever done is cheat.
Cheater!

234
00:17:05,018 --> 00:17:07,988
No! [Crying]

235
00:17:10,457 --> 00:17:11,925
What's going on with her?

236
00:17:12,759 --> 00:17:14,494
Mercury, calm down!

237
00:17:14,628 --> 00:17:16,096
Someone's controlling her!

238
00:17:21,235 --> 00:17:30,968
[All Yelling At Ami]

239
00:17:30,968 --> 00:17:36,955
[All Yelling At Ami]

240
00:17:37,022 --> 00:17:37,956
[Gasp]

241
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:43,071
You heard them Sailor Mercury,
kill all those bad mouthed
fools!

242
00:17:43,138 --> 00:17:46,308
Get rid of them so they can't
call you names anymore!

243
00:17:51,913 --> 00:17:57,652
Come on now, I'm so looking
forward to watching you wipe
them out! [Laughing]

244
00:17:59,955 --> 00:18:02,791
[Gasp] Oh no, what is she doing?

245
00:18:02,991 --> 00:18:05,994
It looks like she's going to use
her Shine Aqua Illusion!

246
00:18:06,128 --> 00:18:08,997
Mercury! You've gotta
snap out of it!

247
00:18:09,064 --> 00:18:11,500
Please don't buy into
those hallucinations!

248
00:18:11,633 --> 00:18:13,835
Mercury, please stop!

249
00:18:13,969 --> 00:18:15,137
[Screams]

250
00:18:18,673 --> 00:18:20,142
Mercury, don't attack us!

251
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:21,376
Please don't!

252
00:18:24,446 --> 00:18:28,316
It's okay, Sailor Mercury would
never harm any of us. Never!

253
00:18:28,817 --> 00:18:30,886
I know that, because I trust
her.

254
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:45,901
[Gasps]

255
00:18:47,302 --> 00:18:50,338
Why are you waiting Sailor
Mercury? It's time to destroy
them.

256
00:18:58,547 --> 00:19:00,949
You must never forgive what they
said about you.

257
00:19:02,184 --> 00:19:04,085
You're the one I'll never
forgive!

258
00:19:04,686 --> 00:19:05,687
What?!

259
00:19:05,921 --> 00:19:07,556
[All] Huh?!

260
00:19:11,426 --> 00:19:15,797
Sine Aqua Illusion!

261
00:19:16,531 --> 00:19:18,099
[Screams]

262
00:19:19,201 --> 00:19:20,635
[Gasps]

263
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:23,805
[Grunts]

264
00:19:25,373 --> 00:19:28,410
Why weren't you fooled by my
hallucinations? How did you
resist my Dark Power?

265
00:19:28,577 --> 00:19:33,949
Your Dark Power can never
deceive us! Our hearts are
connected by trust in one
another.

266
00:19:34,549 --> 00:19:35,450
[Happy Sighs]

267
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:36,585
You tell her!

268
00:19:37,118 --> 00:19:38,053
Damn it!

269
00:19:38,553 --> 00:19:40,555
Now finish her, Sailor Moon!

270
00:19:40,689 --> 00:19:41,590
[Gasp]

271
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:42,924
Hmm.

272
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:08,717
Moon Princess Halation!

273
00:20:12,053 --> 00:20:12,854
[Gasps]

274
00:20:14,022 --> 00:20:17,692
[Screams]

275
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:39,681
Good work. You successfully
stopped another enemy plan.

276
00:20:39,781 --> 00:20:44,853
As always, the power of your
friendship is nothing short of
impressive. Farewell.

277
00:20:45,854 --> 00:20:47,689
Giwark failed?!

278
00:20:49,224 --> 00:20:51,760
I told you that lazing around in
a tub wasn't the way to get the
job done.

279
00:20:52,127 --> 00:20:54,729
[Laughing]

280
00:20:54,796 --> 00:20:58,066
Don't worry. I'll find a new
Negative Point soon.

281
00:20:58,533 --> 00:21:03,471
And Saphir, let me make this
perfectly clear. There is only
one person allowed to watch me
bathe.

282
00:21:03,605 --> 00:21:04,973
Now get the hell out!

283
00:21:05,507 --> 00:21:10,445
[Laughing]

284
00:21:10,578 --> 00:21:13,448
Next time I'll destroy anyone
who gets in my way.

285
00:21:16,651 --> 00:21:20,755
Thanks Ami, for not letting
those hallucinations fool you
about us.

286
00:21:20,822 --> 00:21:21,489
No worries.

287
00:21:23,158 --> 00:21:26,127
Besides, I felt that all of you
truly believed that I would
never cheat, am I right?

288
00:21:26,194 --> 00:21:26,962
Hmm.

289
00:21:28,163 --> 00:21:30,031
Okay, even if you had some
momentary doubts...

290
00:21:30,131 --> 00:21:33,001
...we're bound by trust, and
that's all that matters!

291
00:21:35,103 --> 00:21:36,104
That's right.

292
00:21:36,771 --> 00:21:38,006
Hi guys, how's it goin?

293
00:21:38,139 --> 00:21:38,707
Oh no.

294
00:21:40,608 --> 00:21:44,512
Hey, Mizuno! Congratulations
to you, for scoring the best
grade on this semester's final
exam.

295
00:21:44,612 --> 00:21:47,749
Good work! Can you give us
pointers on how to study for it
next time?

296
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:50,785
Do your best. That's the only
secret I know.

297
00:21:50,919 --> 00:21:53,788
There's no particular method.
Just know all the material.

298
00:21:55,623 --> 00:21:57,359
What's up with them?

299
00:21:59,027 --> 00:22:01,696
Those are the same students who
spread the nasty rumors about
Ami being a cheater.

300
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:03,365
Now don't be angry, Usagi.

301
00:22:03,431 --> 00:22:08,103
You're forgetting that everyone
at the Cram school was affected
by the Dark Power.

302
00:22:08,203 --> 00:22:10,438
That's right. You should
be angry at the enemy.

303
00:22:10,672 --> 00:22:11,740
Hmm.

304
00:22:12,841 --> 00:22:14,709
Usagi, why don't you come
join our study sessions?

305
00:22:14,776 --> 00:22:15,377
Ew!

306
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:20,982
Ahh! Studying makes me crazy!

307
00:22:21,049 --> 00:22:24,019
Studying! I'm getting a rash!
I'm itchy all over!

308
00:22:24,085 --> 00:22:27,722
[Sigh] That's our Usagi all
right.

309
00:22:27,856 --> 00:22:31,860

Hey Chibi-Usa, who was that girl
that came by to visit you?

311
00:24:13,209 --> 00:24:18,081
Oh, you mean Momo? We go to
the same school! She's my best
friend.

312
00:24:18,214 --> 00:24:20,717
Yeah? Well she was acting
kind of strange.

313
00:24:20,817 --> 00:24:21,651
What?!

314
00:24:22,174 --> 00:24:23,675
I think the enemy is controlling
your friend!

315
00:24:23,809 --> 00:24:27,045
Sailor Moon! You have to get her
away from them!

316
00:24:27,646 --> 00:24:33,318
Next time on Sailor Moon R: "The
Dark Gate is Completed! The
Targeted Elementary School!"

317
00:24:33,452 --> 00:24:36,121
The moonlight is a messenger
of love.
