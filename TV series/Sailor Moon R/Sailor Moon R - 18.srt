You know some things that I just
<i>can't stand?</i>

2
00:02:00,562 --> 00:02:04,529
<i>Thunder and lightning, that's</i>
what! They're so loud and scary!

00:02:04,562 --> 00:02:07,629
<i>Oh, no! Now a Droid is using</i>
<i>them as a weapon!</i>

Gosh it's so hot!

9
00:02:38,995 --> 00:02:40,062
Whew!

10
00:02:43,929 --> 00:02:49,229
You like my new lip gloss? This
summer I'm planning on making
the color of death all the rage.

11
00:02:50,195 --> 00:02:54,095
[Giggling] Black's deliciously
dark! It's the color of
mourning.

12
00:02:55,295 --> 00:02:57,995
It's a color that's so
full of sin.

13
00:02:58,029 --> 00:02:59,295
So what do you think?

14
00:02:59,329 --> 00:03:02,062
[Giggling] It's
simply lovely.

15
00:03:02,095 --> 00:03:05,995
With this ribbon, I will turn
any man into my willing slave...

16
00:03:06,029 --> 00:03:11,529
That ribbon's much too bright.
And you've got your mascara on
way too thick, Calaveras.

17
00:03:11,795 --> 00:03:14,962
<i>Take my advice, you really</i>
<i>need to rethink your makeup.</i>

18
00:03:14,995 --> 00:03:18,595
You know Koan, as the youngest,
you shouldn't be so quick to
judge.

19
00:03:18,629 --> 00:03:21,862
What about you wearing that
striped bodysuit in this heat?

20
00:03:21,895 --> 00:03:24,562
Are you trying to hide some
blotchy skin or something?

21
00:03:24,595 --> 00:03:27,095
That was mean! I demand an
apology!

22
00:03:27,595 --> 00:03:28,529
Hmph.

23
00:03:28,562 --> 00:03:30,062

to lure out the rabbit.

Please tell us!

27
00:03:42,229 --> 00:03:44,929
The Rabbit is deathly afraid of
thunder.

28
00:03:45,762 --> 00:03:51,862
Oh I get it! We'll use thunder
and lightning to scare her,
she'll run outside, then we can
eliminate her.

29
00:03:52,129 --> 00:03:53,695
Precisely.

30
00:03:55,229 --> 00:03:58,929
I have just the droid among my
minions to complete this task.
So please...

Furaiki!

34

Use your flash of lightening
and rumble of thunder!

She's not here, Usagi.

46
00:05:10,929 --> 00:05:12,829
Oh, yeah? Where'd she go?

47
00:05:12,862 --> 00:05:14,895
I guess you forgot what
she said at breakfast?

48
00:05:15,229 --> 00:05:16,229
Hah?

49
00:05:17,195 --> 00:05:18,162
Your Mom went shopping
with her friend today.

50
00:05:19,262 --> 00:05:21,062
She told you she'd probably be
out 'til late, remember?

51
00:05:21,962 --> 00:05:24,562
No!

52
00:05:24,595 --> 00:05:28,529
In that case Luna, you need to
get me a towel right away, I'm
soaking wet!

53
00:05:28,562 --> 00:05:32,495
I'm soaking wet and you're my
pet! How 'bout that?

54
00:05:32,762 --> 00:05:36,262
How 'bout you're acting like a
big drip but now isn't the time
for that.

55
00:05:36,295 --> 00:05:39,095
You really need to get your
raincoat and get over to school.

56
00:05:39,295 --> 00:05:40,795
And why should I do that?

57
00:05:42,162 --> 00:05:44,595
Because Chibi-Usa still hasn't
come home from her swimming
class yet.

Umm, is Chibi-Usa home yet?

anywhere. I've been searching
for 20 minutes already!

I was kinda hoping that maybe
she showed up back at home.

She isn't here so she hasn't
come home! Poor Chibi-Usa.

00:09:17,862 --> 00:09:19,829
Guess you better get out
there and find her.

It's Chibi-Usa! I can't find

you'll help?

Of course I will!

123
00:10:32,162 --> 00:10:36,629
So you're giving me the cold
shoulder, but you wanna help
just because Chibi-Usa is
involved. I see how it is now.

Stop that!
She's just a kid!

125
00:10:39,595 --> 00:10:43,662
She must be feeling pretty
helpless right now, lost in
this rain.

Yes I'm worried for her. So
let's not waste time! C'mon!

00:10:48,662 --> 00:10:49,829
Right!

Mamoru said he didn't want to
see Usagi anymore.

<i>Maybe he's changed his mind.</i>

132
00:11:08,829 --> 00:11:12,562
Could be, but I think they
should spend their time
studying, better than running
around together in the rain.

are you guys up to?

00:11:16,829 --> 00:11:19,962
Not much. I saw Ami here and
decided to join her for
some lunch.

00:11:20,629 --> 00:11:24,629
Oh yeah? I was trying to dodge
this rain when I ran into
Minako.

137
00:11:24,662 --> 00:11:28,629
Yeah, I ducked in here to wait
for the rain to let up and I
thought I'd study...

138
00:11:28,662 --> 00:11:32,762

English, social studies and
science while I waited.

But we are missing a certain
someone.

back and see Mommy and Daddy.

While that key allows you to
travel through time, you mustn't

This must be a physical anomaly.
The only explanation is that
earths gravity suddenly stopped
working!

Tuxedo Mask, it's you!

Tuxedo Mask, wow...

239
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:09,387
When a drum is played right,
it's a musical instrument that
brings joy to peoples hearts...

240
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:13,387
But using it as a weapon is a

[Growl]

You'd do better to play a fun,

instead.

00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,187
Huh!

So what will you do now?

256
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:28,320
Nothing. That place was way
too weird to fight in.

257
00:19:28,854 --> 00:19:30,987
I need to regroup.
I'm leaving!

[Screams]
Careful Tuxedo Mask!

261
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:48,087
I don't understand, why are we
still floating?

262
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,720
I'm sorry, that's
because of me...

263

Wait a sec, are you saying
you're responsible for this,
Chibi-Usa?

264
00:19:55,187 --> 00:19:57,687
Mhmm. This is my fault...

[Sighs]

269
00:20:19,454 --> 00:20:21,920
So! What's with
this necklace?

270
00:20:21,954 --> 00:20:26,687
Please let go! All I was trying
to do was just go home again!

271
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:30,187
Go home? Chibi-Usa,
where is that?

272
00:20:30,487 --> 00:20:32,787
Home is where my Mommy is!

273

Well where exactly is
your mommy now?

you came from.

Stop it! Let
go of me!

277
00:20:44,887 --> 00:20:48,454
Won't you please tell us the
truth about you? Maybe then we
can help you.
