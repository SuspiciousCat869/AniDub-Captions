1
00:00:22,556 --> 00:00:26,795
In today's episode of
Sailor Moon, We'll be
showing lots of clips
from past adventures...

2
00:00:26,828 --> 00:00:29,397
...and a special sneak
peak at what's to come
for our third season.

3
00:00:29,431 --> 00:00:32,367
And there's a rumor
the Sailor Guardians
might be getting a
new leader.

4
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,969
What?!

5
00:00:35,003 --> 00:00:43,011
"Pretty Guardian Sailor
Moon. Usagi and the Girls'
Resolve: Prelude to a
New Battle."

6
00:02:15,804 --> 00:02:20,508
Moon Crystal Power...
Make Up!

7
00:02:33,521 --> 00:02:39,160
Hey! I'm Usagi
Tsukino and as you
know I'm also Sailor
Moon!

8
00:02:39,194 --> 00:02:42,130
The Pretty Guardian
who fights for love
and for justice.

9
00:02:42,163 --> 00:02:45,033
Today you're going to
get a taste of our
upcoming season.

10
00:02:45,066 --> 00:02:50,805
And of course, just in case
anyone was wondering. I'm
going to continue to do
my best as the leader.

11
00:02:50,839 --> 00:02:53,041
So don't pay any
attention to that
silly rumor.

12
00:02:53,041 --> 00:03:00,114
Now let's get this
show started!

13
00:03:00,148 --> 00:03:02,784
Woah! Where did
they come from?

14
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:03,451
Who are they?

15
00:03:03,485 --> 00:03:07,055
Potential friends
or brand new enemies?

16
00:03:07,088 --> 00:03:11,893
Or maybe you're getting
dumped as the series lead
and one of these girls
is your replacement.

17
00:03:11,926 --> 00:03:16,197
My replacement?!
What's up? I thought
I was popular!

18
00:03:16,231 --> 00:03:19,501
So Ami, is
this guy supposed
to be our new enemy?

19
00:03:19,534 --> 00:03:22,303
It appears to be. But
we still don't know
what his objectives are.

20
00:03:22,303 --> 00:03:23,938
Or even who he is.

21
00:03:23,972 --> 00:03:26,140
And we don't know who
those two girls
are either.

22
00:03:26,174 --> 00:03:29,777
It looks like the next
season is going to be
pretty intense from
the start.

23
00:03:29,777 --> 00:03:33,548
Hey, go back a second.
Do those two girls look
like Sailor Guardians?

24
00:03:33,781 --> 00:03:37,185
As far as we know,
the only Sailor Guardian
who exists besides
us is...

25
00:03:37,185 --> 00:03:38,520
Sailor Pluto!

26
00:03:38,553 --> 00:03:43,224
Those who violate the
taboo and approach
the door of space and
time...

27
00:03:43,258 --> 00:03:54,202
...must be eliminated!

28
00:03:54,235 --> 00:03:59,507
But since she's on permanent
guard duty at the Door of
Space and Time, she's not
going anywhere.

29
00:03:59,541 --> 00:04:03,077
I wonder if Sailor
Pluto is somehow
connected to those
two girls.

30
00:04:03,111 --> 00:04:04,913
Ah! I've got it!

31
00:04:04,913 --> 00:04:06,180
I know what' going on.

32
00:04:06,214 --> 00:04:10,018
Those two are being
recruited by Luna the
same way she recruited us!

33
00:04:10,051 --> 00:04:12,186
[in unison]
What?!

34
00:04:12,186 --> 00:04:13,988
[scared squealing]

35
00:04:14,022 --> 00:04:24,465
First thing's first,
I wanted to say thank you for
saving me from those kids
earlier today.

36
00:04:24,465 --> 00:04:28,169
[curious reaction]

37
00:04:28,169 --> 00:04:30,939
A little gift
from me, just for you.

38
00:04:30,972 --> 00:04:33,775
Wow! For me?
It's so beautiful.

39
00:04:33,808 --> 00:04:35,843
Usagi, I need
you to listen to me.

40
00:04:35,877 --> 00:04:36,978
Awesome! Thank
you so much.

41
00:04:37,011 --> 00:04:39,781
[squeal]
No way! What's
going on?!

42
00:04:39,914 --> 00:04:41,916
I don't believe it
I transformed!

43
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:44,786
Usagi, we weren't
actually recruited.

44
00:04:44,786 --> 00:04:49,490
If you remember, long ago
we were chosen to be
Guardians by the
Moon Kingdom.

45
00:04:49,524 --> 00:04:51,125
O-Oh yeah,
that's right!

46
00:04:51,159 --> 00:04:52,460
Hmm...

47
00:04:52,460 --> 00:05:03,771
Well then maybe the
girls came here from
the future, like
Chibi-Usa!

48
00:05:03,771 --> 00:05:10,111
Hm?

49
00:05:10,144 --> 00:05:12,914
[startled gasps]

50
00:05:12,914 --> 00:05:14,816
[grunt]

51
00:05:14,849 --> 00:05:19,454
[muffled sounds]

52
00:05:19,454 --> 00:05:21,856
[confused reaction]
Who are you?

53
00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:23,925
Just where did you
come from anyway?!

54
00:05:23,925 --> 00:05:25,994
I am Usagi.

55
00:05:26,027 --> 00:05:27,895
Huh?

56
00:05:27,929 --> 00:05:31,466
But if they're from the
future...Why didn't King
Endmyion tell us that
they'd be coming our way?

57
00:05:31,466 --> 00:05:33,167
Maybe he forgot?

58
00:05:33,167 --> 00:05:37,405
Well...I guess we
should think positive, and
assume that they're on our
side. Right?

59
00:05:37,438 --> 00:05:39,874
Then why haven't they
shown us their faces?

60
00:05:39,907 --> 00:05:41,809
Oh brother!

61
00:05:41,843 --> 00:05:44,812
Maybe they're just being
sneaky 'cause they don't
want us to know that they're
really our new enemies!

62
00:05:44,846 --> 00:05:45,913
Well we can't say
for sure.

63
00:05:45,947 --> 00:05:56,958
But there will be
others who are
clearly not friendly.

64
00:05:56,991 --> 00:05:59,861
[gasp]
Hey! Who was
that monster?!

65
00:05:59,894 --> 00:06:02,397
Maybe she's a Dark
Kingdom monster!

66
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:07,101
She kinda looks like
Ail and An's Cardians.

67
00:06:07,135 --> 00:06:08,069
[yelp]

68
00:06:11,139 --> 00:06:12,940
[shocked gasp]

69
00:06:12,974 --> 00:06:14,876
[snickering]

70
00:06:14,909 --> 00:06:17,979
Or she could be a
droid from the
Black Moon Clan.

71
00:06:18,012 --> 00:06:22,483
No. She doesn't seem like
any of the enemies we've
come across before.

72
00:06:22,517 --> 00:06:25,987
I'm still wondering about
those two new girls and
how they'll fit into
our story.

73
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:30,892
Time to finish you!

74
00:06:30,925 --> 00:06:33,961
[nervous gasp]

75
00:06:33,995 --> 00:06:39,801
[terrified wailing]

76
00:06:39,834 --> 00:06:41,769
Who are you?!

77
00:06:41,803 --> 00:06:43,504
Oh, I got it!

78
00:06:43,538 --> 00:06:47,341
I bet those two girls are
here to watch over us, and
will show up in the knick
of time to save us.

79
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:48,843
Just like Tuxedo Mask!

80
00:06:48,876 --> 00:06:50,978
That would be nice.

81
00:06:51,012 --> 00:06:53,915
[gasp]

82
00:06:53,915 --> 00:06:57,485
Morga...You
failed me.
You fool.

83
00:06:57,518 --> 00:07:01,389
It would be a refreshing
change if our leader
didn't need to be saved
all the time.

84
00:07:01,422 --> 00:07:04,425
Yeah I think another
one of us should take
over as the leader
in the new season.

85
00:07:04,459 --> 00:07:06,494
Huh? What are
you talking about?!

86
00:07:06,527 --> 00:07:12,567
I love being saved
by Tuxedo Mask!

87
00:07:12,767 --> 00:07:14,001
Sailor Mars!

88
00:07:14,035 --> 00:07:15,937
Sailor Mercury!

89
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:17,438
Sailor Jupiter!

90
00:07:17,438 --> 00:07:20,408
Sailor Venus!

91
00:08:26,507 --> 00:08:28,309
Play time is over.

92
00:08:28,309 --> 00:08:29,911
Who are you?!

93
00:08:29,911 --> 00:08:31,546
Who am I,
you ask?

94
00:08:31,779 --> 00:08:35,316
I am Crimson Rubeus
of the Black Moon Clan.

95
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:36,517
Why are you after her?

96
00:08:36,551 --> 00:08:40,188
We are on a mission to
change the future
of this metropolis.

97
00:08:40,188 --> 00:08:50,364
And the only way for
that to happen is...

98
00:08:50,398 --> 00:08:55,536
...For her to die!

99
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:56,404
[gasp]

100
00:08:56,437 --> 00:09:02,543
[battle cry]

101
00:09:02,777 --> 00:09:03,444
[grunt]

102
00:09:03,477 --> 00:09:05,446
[gasp]

103
00:09:05,446 --> 00:09:07,081
So, as I was saying...

104
00:09:07,114 --> 00:09:11,185
Since we'll be going
up against new enemies,
it might be time for
a new leader.

105
00:09:11,219 --> 00:09:12,887
Why do you
keep saying that?!

106
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:13,988
[giggle]

107
00:09:14,021 --> 00:09:17,325
Don't worry Usagi, it's
gonna be alright.
You'll see.

108
00:09:17,358 --> 00:09:18,993
Just leave everything
to me!

109
00:09:19,026 --> 00:09:21,329
Hey-hey-hey-
hey-hey-hey!

110
00:09:21,362 --> 00:09:24,198
Well, I'd like a
chance to try out for
the leading role.

111
00:09:24,232 --> 00:09:25,466
Now just hold
on here!

112
00:09:25,499 --> 00:09:29,470
I guess I'm not
the only one
interested in taking
over from Usagi.

113
00:09:29,503 --> 00:09:30,771
What?!

114
00:09:30,771 --> 00:09:32,506
I've got my computer
handy.

115
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:36,911
I think we should check
into our data bank to
see who has the best skills
to handle our new enemies

116
00:09:36,911 --> 00:09:37,945
Oh, come on!

117
00:09:37,979 --> 00:09:40,781
There's no point in
doing all that long
research.

118
00:09:40,781 --> 00:09:44,452
I think we should just
make it easy, and decide
with a simple game of
rock, paper, scissors.

119
00:09:44,485 --> 00:09:48,322
Seriously? No way!
I really suck at that game!

120
00:09:48,356 --> 00:09:50,391
Then why don't we
arm wrestle
for the job?

121
00:09:50,424 --> 00:09:51,425
Oh, get real!

122
00:09:51,459 --> 00:09:53,094
Yeah, forget it!

123
00:09:53,127 --> 00:09:57,198
Let's decide it with
fortune telling based
on who's had the best
luck this year.

124
00:09:57,231 --> 00:10:00,167
Let me see...Oh!
Look at that,
it's me!

125
00:10:00,201 --> 00:10:03,337
That's not fair!

126
00:10:03,371 --> 00:10:04,505
I think there's
a bett way.

127
00:10:04,538 --> 00:10:07,775
Why don't we decide it
fair and square with
a game of chess.

128
00:10:07,775 --> 00:10:09,410
No, not chess! I
suck at that too!

129
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:11,879
You couldn't
even beat Chibi-Usa.

130
00:10:11,913 --> 00:10:13,414
Thanks for reminding
me, Mako.

131
00:10:13,447 --> 00:10:15,349
Let's have a staring
contest instead!

132
00:10:15,383 --> 00:10:16,117
What?!

133
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:17,919
A staring contest!
Let's do it.

134
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:18,953
If you laugh,
you lose!

135
00:10:18,986 --> 00:10:22,924
On the count of three
stare at me one,
two, three!

136
00:10:22,924 --> 00:10:24,926
[laughing]

137
00:10:24,926 --> 00:10:29,463
What a bunch of goofy
faces! You all look
so weird!
[laughing]

138
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:30,932
Laugh's on you,
you lose!

139
00:10:30,932 --> 00:10:32,366
[disappointed whine]

140
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:36,304
If we keep doing silly
stuff like this,
we're going to lose
our viewers, too.

141
00:10:36,337 --> 00:10:37,271
What?!

142
00:10:37,305 --> 00:10:39,307
We definitely don't
wanna do that!
No way!

143
00:10:39,307 --> 00:10:43,911
Then let's take a look back
at all we've accomplished and
choose who should take the
new leading role...

144
00:10:43,911 --> 00:10:46,447
...based on who has
the best overall appeal
to our viewers.

145
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,316
Sounds fine by me!

146
00:10:48,349 --> 00:10:51,852
Alright everybody, let's
learn how popular we
really are with the fans.

147
00:10:51,886 --> 00:10:53,487
I can't wait
to find out!

148
00:10:53,521 --> 00:10:55,122
Jeez!

149
00:10:55,156 --> 00:11:00,194
I have so many wonderfil
qualities that I should
be a shoe-in! So bring
it on!

150
00:11:00,194 --> 00:11:06,334
After the commercial break,
we're going all out to show
you more exciting clips
from our past seasons.

151
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:12,173
And a glimpse of the new!
So don't go away, we'll
be right back!

152
00:11:21,449 --> 00:11:24,986
Sailor Moon!

153
00:11:30,482 --> 00:11:33,094
Sailor Moon!

154
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:45,272
Wait a minute,
what's going on?

155
00:11:45,306 --> 00:11:47,221
I'm showing clips
from the next season...

156
00:11:47,455 --> 00:11:50,992
...which have been
carefully kept under
lock and key, until now.

157
00:11:51,025 --> 00:11:52,727
Why have they been
given to you?!

158
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:55,063
Rei's just trying
out having the
leading role.

159
00:11:55,096 --> 00:11:58,099
No way!

160
00:11:58,132 --> 00:12:00,134
[evil laughter]

161
00:12:00,134 --> 00:12:03,938
Just leave everything
to me! I'm going
to be the new leader!

162
00:12:03,971 --> 00:12:05,940
I'm the natural choice!

163
00:12:05,973 --> 00:12:11,145
If you remember, I was the
big star at the T.A.
Girl's Academy School
Festival!

164
00:12:11,145 --> 00:12:16,818
[cheering]

165
00:12:16,851 --> 00:12:19,854
And just watch
how I handle these
action scenes.

166
00:12:19,887 --> 00:12:22,123
[grunt]

167
00:12:22,156 --> 00:12:23,858
[battle cry]

168
00:12:23,858 --> 00:12:28,229
As you can see I am more
than qualified and I have
no worries about my
popularity.

169
00:12:28,463 --> 00:12:29,931
But if you take
the lead...

170
00:12:29,964 --> 00:12:34,469
The show will be overloaded
with craziness from all your
goofy faces and epic fails.

171
00:12:34,502 --> 00:12:35,870
Oh yeah?

172
00:12:35,903 --> 00:12:39,140
Yeah it could get too
silly and turn off
viewers who're looking
for a story.

173
00:12:39,173 --> 00:12:41,075
[chattering]

174
00:12:41,109 --> 00:12:43,010
Fire...!

175
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:45,780
[surprised reactions]

176
00:12:45,813 --> 00:12:48,116
Soul...

177
00:12:48,116 --> 00:12:48,883
[hearty laughing]

178
00:12:48,916 --> 00:12:51,085
Hey! I am not
the comic relief!

179
00:12:51,119 --> 00:12:52,120
[small whines of pain]

180
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:55,022
What about me? I've
got plenty of star
qualities.

181
00:12:55,056 --> 00:12:59,026
She barely bumped you.
That's pretty low,
trying to con an
innocent girl.

182
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:00,461
Why you!

183
00:13:00,495 --> 00:13:03,798
[grunt of pain and shock]

184
00:13:03,831 --> 00:13:09,137
I'm not only strong...

185
00:13:09,137 --> 00:13:19,814
...but I'm agile, as
you may remember
from my ice-skating
episode.

186
00:13:19,847 --> 00:13:23,751
[battle cry]
Let's do this!

187
00:13:23,785 --> 00:13:25,853
My domestic skills
are outstanding too.

188
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:29,457
I'm a super-duper
cleaning whiz, and a
terrific cook.

189
00:13:29,457 --> 00:13:32,193
My appealing abilities
make me the best-
suited candidate.

190
00:13:32,226 --> 00:13:33,861
You won't admit your
weaknesses!

191
00:13:33,895 --> 00:13:35,663
I, on the other hand,
don't have any!

192
00:13:35,696 --> 00:13:41,469
But since you offered...
[chewing effort]

193
00:13:41,469 --> 00:13:45,873
Yeah Mako, your big
weakness, is you can't
get over the guy who
broke your heart.

194
00:13:45,907 --> 00:13:48,843
Well you should talk,
you're in the same
boat Minako.

195
00:13:48,876 --> 00:13:54,882
No way! I am not hung up
on any past boyfriend, and
I'd be perfect for the new
lead!

196
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:59,220
After all, I was the
original Sailor Guardian,
formly known as Sailor V.

197
00:13:59,453 --> 00:14:09,630
[painful yelp]

198
00:14:09,664 --> 00:14:13,668
Back in those days,
they made all kinds
of Sailor V merchandise!

199
00:14:13,701 --> 00:14:16,704
Anime! Video games!
Even pencil cases!

200
00:14:16,737 --> 00:14:20,007
I was super popular,
and kids just love me!

201
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:26,147
[cheering]

202
00:14:26,147 --> 00:14:30,051
You're right. We won
because they believed
in us.

203
00:14:30,084 --> 00:14:32,854
[yelling]

204
00:14:32,887 --> 00:14:34,856
Why is this happening?!

205
00:14:34,856 --> 00:14:37,058
I can't stop this thing!

206
00:14:37,091 --> 00:14:38,960
Sorry about that!

207
00:14:38,993 --> 00:14:40,895
[screaming]

208
00:14:40,928 --> 00:14:42,930
You may have been a
superhero to those
kids...

209
00:14:42,964 --> 00:14:46,601
But when you tried
to be our nurse, you
were clumsier at it
than I was!

210
00:14:46,634 --> 00:14:47,969
What do you mean clumsier?

211
00:14:48,002 --> 00:14:50,738
You girls are so
alike, you even look
alike!

212
00:14:50,771 --> 00:14:54,909
I don't see
that at all!

213
00:14:54,942 --> 00:14:56,611
Groups of five, really?

214
00:14:56,611 --> 00:14:57,211
But why?

215
00:14:57,245 --> 00:14:57,845
Well-

216
00:14:57,879 --> 00:14:58,913
It sounds suspicious!

217
00:14:58,946 --> 00:15:01,782
Don't you wanna
check it out and
see what's going on?

218
00:15:01,816 --> 00:15:05,653
Rei has a point. You
guys act like twins
when you're together.

219
00:15:05,686 --> 00:15:08,723
But, I'm not
a ditz like Usagi.

220
00:15:08,756 --> 00:15:10,858
And I'm not nearly
as clumsy as you!

221
00:15:10,892 --> 00:15:14,028
Need I remind you
what happenedn when
you tried to
ice-skate.

222
00:15:14,061 --> 00:15:15,997
You really don't
need to bring that up.

223
00:15:15,997 --> 00:15:19,901
At this point, I
guess I'm about the
only candidate left.

224
00:15:19,934 --> 00:15:23,037
But taking on the
leading role really
isn't for me.

225
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:26,040
Don't let that stop
you from showing
off all your best
moments!

226
00:15:26,073 --> 00:15:27,642
Oh, it's not like
that at all.

227
00:15:27,675 --> 00:15:31,812
I'm just trying to
share some useful
advice for the kids
watching our show.

228
00:15:31,846 --> 00:15:33,547
Uh-huh...

229
00:15:33,581 --> 00:15:38,853
Wait, I know what must
have happened. You
stopped using the crystal
disk, didn't you?

230
00:15:38,853 --> 00:15:43,124
I did! Studying should
be done on your own.
Using the disc was like
cheating, you jerk!

231
00:15:43,124 --> 00:15:52,033
When I do turn into
an evil monster...
Don't hesitate to kill
me immediately!

232
00:15:52,066 --> 00:15:55,803
You're wrong. The
future is something
you create yourself.

233
00:15:55,836 --> 00:15:59,140
if you give in to
negative thoughts,
nothing will change.

234
00:15:59,173 --> 00:16:04,612
You can create any fate you
want, if you just believe
in yourself enough to
know you can do it!

235
00:16:04,645 --> 00:16:05,880
Mm-hm...

236
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,082
That's what a friend
of mine told me...

237
00:16:08,115 --> 00:16:13,020
She said I was in
denial and that I
should just be more
honest with myself.

238
00:16:13,054 --> 00:16:15,122
But Ami...

239
00:16:15,156 --> 00:16:18,059
Sacrificing yourself
is certainly noble...

240
00:16:18,092 --> 00:16:24,498
But be honest, wouldn't
you really rather keep on
living as a human
being instead?

241
00:16:24,532 --> 00:16:31,572
Seems like you've
forgotten about the
people who will be
very sad if you die.

242
00:16:31,605 --> 00:16:32,073
Mercury!

243
00:16:32,106 --> 00:16:32,840
You saved us!

244
00:16:32,873 --> 00:16:33,674
You came back!

245
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:35,943
How come?

246
00:16:35,977 --> 00:16:40,815
Friendship is just
way more important!

247
00:16:40,848 --> 00:16:45,953
[soft giggles]

248
00:16:45,987 --> 00:16:48,022
You're the one
I'll never forgive!

249
00:16:48,055 --> 00:16:49,490
What?!

250
00:16:49,523 --> 00:16:51,826
[shocked gasps]

251
00:16:51,859 --> 00:16:53,828
[frustrated grunt]

252
00:16:53,861 --> 00:16:56,063
Why weren't you
fooled by my
hallucinations?

253
00:16:56,097 --> 00:16:58,566
How did you resist
my dark power!

254
00:16:58,599 --> 00:17:01,068
Your dark power
could never deceive us!

255
00:17:01,102 --> 00:17:04,105
Our hearts are connected
by trust in one another.

256
00:17:04,138 --> 00:17:05,039
[pleased reactions]

257
00:17:05,072 --> 00:17:10,077
You tell her!

258
00:17:10,111 --> 00:17:12,513
We don't have anymore
time to spend in
the past.

259
00:17:12,546 --> 00:17:15,716
It appears our new
enemy is getting ready
to make a move.

260
00:17:15,716 --> 00:17:18,686
Oh sure, you say that
after you show us all
your clips.

261
00:17:18,719 --> 00:17:21,722
Make way, 'cause now
it's my turn!

262
00:17:21,756 --> 00:17:25,993
[painful reactions]

263
00:17:26,027 --> 00:17:26,961
Stop it!

264
00:17:26,994 --> 00:17:29,864
[defeated whimpers]

265
00:17:29,897 --> 00:17:35,736
Even if you went out right now
and bought us the finest haute
couture trend-setting designs
as replacements...

266
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:41,242
I can't forgive you
for trying to shred
our Sailor Guardian
outfits!

267
00:17:41,475 --> 00:17:46,647
[shocked gasp]

268
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:50,851
I am Kunzite! A
proud member of
the Dark Kingdom's
Four Kings of Heaven!

269
00:17:50,885 --> 00:17:54,655
You can't make me
yell out refresh ever!

270
00:17:54,688 --> 00:17:57,691
[battle cry]

271
00:17:58,692 --> 00:18:00,461
What?!

272
00:18:01,829 --> 00:18:05,666
[shocked gasp]
Impossible!

273
00:18:05,699 --> 00:18:11,238
Crawl like a toad
while my gravity
grinds you into
a muck. Ha!

274
00:18:11,472 --> 00:18:15,009
[struggling]

275
00:18:15,042 --> 00:18:17,945
[nasty chuckle]
Now die.

276
00:18:17,978 --> 00:18:20,047
[small groans]

277
00:18:20,081 --> 00:18:21,582
[laughing]

278
00:18:21,615 --> 00:18:23,717
[struggling]

279
00:18:23,717 --> 00:18:24,785
[surprised gasp]

280
00:18:24,819 --> 00:18:29,457
[painful struggling]

281
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:31,725
I'll never give up!

282
00:18:31,725 --> 00:18:35,629
[painful groan]
I will save
my friends!

283
00:18:35,663 --> 00:18:37,865
[triumphant laugh]
That's what I'm
talking about!

284
00:18:37,898 --> 00:18:42,503
The undisputed, very
appealing lead heroine
is me, Sailor Moon!

285
00:18:42,536 --> 00:18:43,938
Well I don't know
if I'd go that far...

286
00:18:43,971 --> 00:18:47,708
But i'll admit, it
does look like you've
been doing your job
as a superhero.

287
00:18:47,741 --> 00:18:48,742
Right?! Right?!

288
00:18:48,776 --> 00:18:51,612
But we can't say
the same about your
personal life.

289
00:18:51,645 --> 00:18:52,746
That's the truth.

290
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:54,582
You're a very
sloppy eater.

291
00:18:54,582 --> 00:18:57,618
And you act around
Chibi-Usa's age most
of the time.

292
00:18:57,651 --> 00:19:00,855
There's no sign
you're improving
your study habits either.

293
00:19:00,855 --> 00:19:03,991
Why are you all
picking on me?!
[wailing]

294
00:19:03,991 --> 00:19:07,962
We're not picking on
you. We're just trying
to be honest.

295
00:19:07,995 --> 00:19:10,831
Yeah, we're just trying
to get you to see what
you need to work on...

296
00:19:10,865 --> 00:19:14,735
...so you can be more
serious about being a
guardian and a princess.
That's all.

297
00:19:14,735 --> 00:19:17,571
Yeah, we just want
you to be the best
that you can be.

298
00:19:17,605 --> 00:19:20,774
Huh? Oh wait, so does
that mean you're not
really upset with me?

299
00:19:20,808 --> 00:19:26,647
Of course not. We all have
weaknesses we could work on.
But we wouldn't be Sailor
Guardians without you.

300
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,715
We love you!

301
00:19:27,715 --> 00:19:29,683
You guys!

302
00:19:29,717 --> 00:19:32,486
[struggling]

303
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:36,590
I won't be sealed away
by the Silver Crystal now
that all the Dark Energy
is mine!

304
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:40,494
[struggling grunt]

305
00:19:40,528 --> 00:19:43,197
Everyone...Give
me all your strength!

306
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:56,844
Please...Right now!

307
00:19:56,877 --> 00:20:03,584
Yes, we are Sailor
Guardians, putting our
hearts and minds together,
working as one.

308
00:20:03,617 --> 00:20:07,655
It doesn't matter who
is the star of this show,
we're all equals.

309
00:20:07,688 --> 00:20:12,560
No matter how powerful
our enemies were, we were
always able to
overcome them...

310
00:20:12,593 --> 00:20:14,461
...with the power of our
friendship!

311
00:20:14,461 --> 00:20:24,505
[painful screaming]

312
00:20:24,505 --> 00:20:40,521
[painful screaming]

313
00:20:40,554 --> 00:20:43,857
What is this?

314
00:20:43,891 --> 00:20:49,630
Please Silver Crystal,
I need the power to protect
everyone that I love.

315
00:20:49,663 --> 00:20:51,465
[gasp]
Chibi-Usa!

316
00:20:51,465 --> 00:20:53,901
Give me your
strength, right now!

317
00:20:53,934 --> 00:20:56,470
Mercury Star Power!

318
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:58,872
Mars Star Power!

319
00:20:58,872 --> 00:21:01,242
Jupiter Star Power!

320
00:21:01,475 --> 00:21:04,745
Venus Star Power!

321
00:21:04,745 --> 00:21:10,751
Moon Crystal Power!

322
00:21:10,784 --> 00:21:11,919
Evil power...

323
00:21:11,952 --> 00:21:13,787
...Begone from
this world!

324
00:21:13,821 --> 00:21:15,723
[battle cry]

325
00:21:15,723 --> 00:21:17,725
This can't be
happening...

326
00:21:17,758 --> 00:21:28,736
I am Death Phantom,
the Ruler of Darkness!

327
00:21:28,769 --> 00:21:31,772
Usako...Can you
hear me? Talk to me!

328
00:21:31,805 --> 00:21:32,473
Usako!

329
00:21:32,473 --> 00:21:34,775
[exhausted sigh]
Mamo...

330
00:21:34,808 --> 00:21:36,744
I'm right here.

331
00:21:36,777 --> 00:21:38,612
Hey there.

332
00:21:38,612 --> 00:21:42,816
[sighs of relief]

333
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:45,819
[gasp]
Chibi-Usa!

334
00:21:45,853 --> 00:21:50,624
I feel so lucky that
I've met all of you, and
that we've become such
wonderful friends.

335
00:21:50,658 --> 00:21:54,862
Let's keep this happy
energy flowing,
as we begin the new
season!

336
00:21:54,862 --> 00:21:58,132
Well, I'd feel a lot
better if I knew
who those girls were.

337
00:21:58,165 --> 00:22:02,736
Friends or foes? We don't
have a clue as to what
the new enemy is gonna be
like.

338
00:22:02,736 --> 00:22:06,707
It'll be alright, Ami. We
won't know the answers
until we see the new
episodes!

339
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:10,878
That's true. So rather than
worrying about things we can't
do anything about...

340
00:22:10,911 --> 00:22:12,946
Let's just move forward!

341
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:18,452
After all, as long as we
always continue to work
together, we can overcome any
challenges that come our way.

342
00:22:18,485 --> 00:22:19,920
You're right.

343
00:22:19,953 --> 00:22:23,157
That's all for now, thanks
for watching! And be sure to
check out our new season!

344
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:27,895
See ya later!

345
00:24:05,626 --> 00:24:08,996
With the Death Phantom
finally defeated, it
was time to have
some fun!

346
00:24:08,996 --> 00:24:09,997
Or so I thought!

347
00:24:09,997 --> 00:24:13,327
[yelp]
Now we have to study
for entrance exams!

348
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,397
Can you believe it?
We're already in
our final year of
middle school!

349
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:18,365
Rei, what's wrong?

350
00:24:18,399 --> 00:24:21,602
It's coming...
The silence is coming!

351
00:24:21,635 --> 00:24:28,008
Next time on Sailor Moon
Super: "Premonition of the
Apocalypse: The Mysterious
New Guardians Appear."

352
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:30,477
The moonlight is a
messenger of love.
