1
00:01:56,952 --> 00:02:01,590
Aww, look at these two!
Chibi-Usa sure is happy to see
her best friend!

2
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:04,860
Hey wait, something's not right
here! Are they fighting?

3
00:02:04,926 --> 00:02:10,966
Those villains! How dare they
use a beautiful friendship
to carry out their evil plans!
To me, that's just unforgivable!

4
00:02:11,066 --> 00:02:15,771
I am Sailor Moon. And in the
name of the moon, I'll punish
you!

00:02:23,211 --> 00:02:28,050
"The Dark Gate Is Completed? The
Targeted Elementary School."

6
00:02:29,718 --> 00:02:34,723
Alright, attention class. I'd
like to introduce you to our
new classmate and friend.

7
00:02:34,856 --> 00:02:39,061
Usagi Tsukino just transferred
to our school. So please, let's
all welcome her!

00:02:39,461 --> 00:02:45,067
[Children Murmuring]

9
00:02:45,734 --> 00:02:46,868
You're so tiny!

10
00:02:47,369 --> 00:02:50,005
We should call her "Chibi-Usa"
because she's so small!

11
00:02:50,072 --> 00:02:53,742
Hey! That's not funny! Stop
calling her names! It's rude!

12
00:02:53,909 --> 00:02:56,344
Chibi-Usa! Chibi-Usa!

13
00:02:56,411 --> 00:02:59,514
Hey Kyusuke! Didn't you
hear me?! Cut it out!

14
00:02:59,614 --> 00:03:01,616
Ow! Okay, I get it.

15
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:04,119
Good. Now apologize to Usagi!

16
00:03:04,252 --> 00:03:07,589
Alright, I'm sorry. Usagi.

17
00:03:07,923 --> 00:03:10,826
But uh, is it okay if we
still call you "Chibi-Usa?"

18
00:03:10,992 --> 00:03:12,861
Yeah, would that be
okay with you?

19
00:03:12,961 --> 00:03:14,663
Sure!

20
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,936
Hmm, her fever seems to
have gone down.

21
00:03:21,036 --> 00:03:23,939
Mhmm, and she looks like she
was having a nice dream.

22
00:03:24,473 --> 00:03:25,907
[Sighs]

23
00:03:26,575 --> 00:03:27,976
So how do you feel?

24
00:03:28,076 --> 00:03:29,611
A little better.

25
00:03:31,746 --> 00:03:34,616
You think I'll be able to go
back to school tomorrow?

26
00:03:34,749 --> 00:03:37,619
[Giggling] You must
think school's fun!

27
00:03:37,819 --> 00:03:41,423
It sure is! You know why?
Because I get to sit next to
this girl who's...

28
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:43,024
Hey there! So how are you
feeling?

29
00:03:43,525 --> 00:03:46,528
I feel much better! I'm
as good as gold!

30
00:03:46,928 --> 00:03:50,365
That's great news! Cause
everyone's just come over to
visit you.

31
00:03:50,465 --> 00:03:51,533
Hi Chibi-Usa!

32
00:03:51,633 --> 00:03:52,701
Hey there!

33
00:03:52,801 --> 00:03:53,969
[Giggling] What's up!?

34
00:03:54,102 --> 00:03:55,570
Here's a get-well gift.

35
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:57,639
Wow, really?! Thank you Ami!

36
00:03:57,739 --> 00:04:01,476
And Chibi-Usa, a cute friend of
yours came to visit you too.

37
00:04:04,146 --> 00:04:05,981
Hi Chibi-Usa.

38
00:04:06,481 --> 00:04:07,649
Oh, wow! Momo!

39
00:04:07,983 --> 00:04:10,886
It's really you! And you're
really here!

40
00:04:10,986 --> 00:04:12,020
Chibi-Usa!

41
00:04:12,154 --> 00:04:14,756
How great! Are you
over your cold?

42
00:04:14,856 --> 00:04:16,391
Yeah, I'm all better now!

43
00:04:16,491 --> 00:04:19,161
[Giggling] I'm so happy
you came to visit!

44
00:04:19,261 --> 00:04:21,763
[Giggling]

45
00:04:22,097 --> 00:04:24,866
You know what Chibi-Usa, I
have really missed you.

46
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,369
Oh yeah? I've missed
seeing you too!

47
00:04:27,469 --> 00:04:28,837
When can we play
together again?

48
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:31,573
Soon! How 'bout tomorrow
when I'm back at school?

49
00:04:31,673 --> 00:04:34,543
You'll never guess what we
watched in class today!

50
00:04:34,643 --> 00:04:36,511
Wow, Chibi-Usa sure
looks happy.

51
00:04:36,745 --> 00:04:38,713
It's cause now she's
got a best friend.

52
00:04:39,147 --> 00:04:42,517
Momo's the first friend she's
made since coming here from the
future.

53
00:04:44,753 --> 00:04:47,989
Why exactly is the Black Moon
Clan after Chibi-Usa?

54
00:04:48,557 --> 00:04:50,926
[All] Huh?

55
00:04:51,526 --> 00:04:53,328
[All] Hmm.

56
00:04:53,695 --> 00:04:57,332
[Laughing]

57
00:05:17,619 --> 00:05:18,620
Heh!

58
00:05:20,889 --> 00:05:22,624
[Grunting]

59
00:05:23,425 --> 00:05:24,326
Huh!

60
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:49,951
[Laughing]

61
00:05:51,052 --> 00:05:52,487
All appears to be
going well, Chiral.

62
00:05:52,587 --> 00:05:54,589
Yes, Master Esmeraude.

63
00:05:54,723 --> 00:05:56,558
What about Achiral?

64
00:05:56,658 --> 00:05:57,993
No problems there.

65
00:05:59,728 --> 00:06:00,629
Good work.

66
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:05,634
From now on, no more elaborate
confusing plans.

67
00:06:05,734 --> 00:06:09,604
They're not my style! And
they've resulted in nothing but
failures.

68
00:06:10,105 --> 00:06:14,809
With this exceptionally powerful
Dark Henge, we will finish this
task all at once.

69
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:15,977
Chiral?

70
00:06:16,111 --> 00:06:16,778
Yes?

71
00:06:16,845 --> 00:06:17,779
Achiral?

72
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:18,113
Yes?

73
00:06:19,447 --> 00:06:22,117
I'll leave it to you to dispose
of those annoying Sailor
Guardians.

74
00:06:22,183 --> 00:06:23,485
As you wish!

75
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:30,792
My gift to Prince Demande will
be my success in this matter, as
I bid this primitive world
adieu...

76
00:06:31,826 --> 00:06:35,397
[Evil Laughter]

77
00:06:36,865 --> 00:06:41,436
Ahh! Now I'm totally going to
be late! [Heavy Breathing]

78
00:06:41,536 --> 00:06:44,639
Boy Luna! You sure could've
helped me out by waking me up
earlier!

79
00:06:44,773 --> 00:06:47,709
I tried, but you wouldn't wake
up no matter what I did!

80
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:49,778
[Heavy Breathing]

81
00:06:49,878 --> 00:06:51,513
I hate being late!

82
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:55,617
[Kids Yelling]

83
00:06:55,784 --> 00:06:57,619
Huh? What's that?

84
00:06:57,952 --> 00:06:59,654
[Kids Yelling]

85
00:06:59,788 --> 00:07:01,022
Huh?

86
00:07:02,757 --> 00:07:06,461
[Kids Yelling]

87
00:07:06,561 --> 00:07:10,932
They're all out here playing,
even though first period's
already started.

88
00:07:11,032 --> 00:07:13,735
I don't think they're playing,
all of them are fighting!

89
00:07:14,202 --> 00:07:16,438
Fighting? [Gasp]

90
00:07:18,006 --> 00:07:19,374
Look! There's Momo!

91
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:20,575
Momo!

92
00:07:20,675 --> 00:07:23,011
Listen you! Don't
talk to me like that!

93
00:07:23,111 --> 00:07:26,881
Ya think you can stop me? I'll
show you, you bully! Ahh!

94
00:07:27,182 --> 00:07:28,616
[Grunts]

95
00:07:28,717 --> 00:07:29,951
[Grunts]

96
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:34,356
I can't believe you did that.

97
00:07:34,689 --> 00:07:36,057
You want some of this?

98
00:07:36,624 --> 00:07:38,059
Uhh, Momo?!

99
00:07:38,193 --> 00:07:43,465
I can't stand you, so you better
just back off! Don't act like
we're friends!

100
00:07:43,765 --> 00:07:45,734
Why are you being such
a meanie Momo?!

101
00:07:45,867 --> 00:07:46,434
Hmph!

102
00:07:46,534 --> 00:07:47,702
[Screams]

103
00:07:47,769 --> 00:07:50,739
Serves you right! [Laughing]

104
00:07:52,006 --> 00:07:54,609
[Grunts] Now I'm angry.

105
00:07:54,909 --> 00:07:56,711
You come back here!

106
00:07:56,945 --> 00:07:59,748
This makes no sense, what's
going on here?

107
00:08:03,585 --> 00:08:06,154
Oh wow! What was that
light just now?!

108
00:08:06,254 --> 00:08:08,156
That is the glow
of Dark Power.

109
00:08:08,256 --> 00:08:10,091
[Gasps] When did you
get here, Artemis?!

110
00:08:21,002 --> 00:08:23,138
How awful, what happened?

111
00:08:23,238 --> 00:08:24,005
Hiya!

112
00:08:24,105 --> 00:08:24,739
[Screams]

113
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:26,341
Momo!

114
00:08:26,441 --> 00:08:27,909
[Growling]

115
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:30,945
[Gasp] No, stay away.

116
00:08:31,446 --> 00:08:33,415
[Screaming]

117
00:08:33,581 --> 00:08:35,316
[Screaming]

118
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:37,752
You won't get away!

119
00:08:42,023 --> 00:08:44,659
[Laughing]

120
00:08:45,927 --> 00:08:48,329
[Heavy Breathing]

121
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:50,031
[All] After her!

122
00:08:50,999 --> 00:08:52,434
[Sighs]

123
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,334
[Screams]

124
00:08:54,402 --> 00:08:56,070
It's just us, Chibi-Usa.

125
00:08:56,504 --> 00:08:58,907
[Sighs] Don't scare
me like that.

126
00:08:59,507 --> 00:09:01,142
What is going on here?

127
00:09:01,209 --> 00:09:02,677
My guess is that the...

128
00:09:02,811 --> 00:09:05,747
Chibi-Usa, are you hiding in
here?!

129
00:09:06,748 --> 00:09:09,017
[Grunting]

130
00:09:11,686 --> 00:09:13,755
So why is she
acting like that?

131
00:09:13,855 --> 00:09:16,157
Esmeraude must
be behind all of this.

132
00:09:16,224 --> 00:09:19,661
Could be. Artemis, let Usagi and
the others know what's up.

133
00:09:19,761 --> 00:09:20,862
Mhmm.

134
00:09:20,995 --> 00:09:23,164
C'mon Chibi-Usa,
let's get out of here.

135
00:09:23,231 --> 00:09:25,733
No, I'm not running away.

136
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:27,241
Huh?

137
00:09:28,643 --> 00:09:31,813
I just can't run off and leave
Momo and the others here like
this.

138
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:36,718
I'm really scared of how mad
they are, but I'm staying.

139
00:09:37,051 --> 00:09:38,553
All right then.

140
00:09:40,054 --> 00:09:43,057
We'll just lay low until Sailor
Moon and the others show up.

141
00:09:43,825 --> 00:09:44,726
What?!

142
00:09:44,826 --> 00:09:46,327
At Chibi-Usa's school?!

143
00:09:46,427 --> 00:09:49,063
Yes, come on we have to go!
Quickly!

144
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,565
Alright then.

145
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:54,669
Girls! You need to come to Juban
Park right now!

146
00:09:55,002 --> 00:09:58,239
Now we have two calls for help!
So what should we do Ami?

147
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:03,578
Mako and I will head out to
Juban Park. You go to
Chibi-Usa's school and help
her and her friends.

148
00:10:03,711 --> 00:10:04,278
Okay.

149
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:10,051
Moon Crystal Power Make Up!

150
00:10:48,222 --> 00:10:53,060
Mercury Star Power Make Up!

151
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:11,846
Jupiter Star Power Make Up!

152
00:11:28,963 --> 00:11:30,031
Huh.

153
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:33,968
This thing was able to
materialize before we
even knew about it?

154
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:36,037
I guess their tactics
have changed.

155
00:11:36,137 --> 00:11:38,840
They're certainly not
messing around this time.

156
00:11:38,973 --> 00:11:42,777
We've got to get rid of that
thing right now, before things
get really out of hand.

157
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:44,111
[Laughing]

158
00:11:44,212 --> 00:11:44,612
[Gasp]

159
00:11:46,447 --> 00:11:49,684
Once it's had the chance to get
this big, there's no way you
have enough power to destroy it.

160
00:11:54,322 --> 00:11:56,290
[Gasp] What is that thing?!

161
00:11:56,357 --> 00:11:57,792
Wow I don't know!

162
00:11:57,859 --> 00:12:00,061
That wasn't even here
a few minutes ago!

163
00:12:07,702 --> 00:12:11,205
Venus Love Me Chain!

164
00:12:12,139 --> 00:12:12,974
Huh!

165
00:12:14,242 --> 00:12:17,178
Burning!

166
00:12:18,746 --> 00:12:21,282
Mandala!

167
00:12:21,849 --> 00:12:22,383
Huh!

168
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:30,858
Shine Aqua Illusion!

169
00:12:30,925 --> 00:12:31,592
Huh!

170
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:34,095
Mercury!

171
00:12:34,195 --> 00:12:35,196
Jupiter!

172
00:12:35,696 --> 00:12:37,698
How nice, looks like
you're all here.

173
00:12:38,032 --> 00:12:41,302
We'll have our showdown at the
Juban Public Elementary School.

174
00:12:41,402 --> 00:12:45,206
Afterwards we'll be sending
you all to hell, just a little
advanced notice.

175
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:47,775
[Laughing]

176
00:12:49,944 --> 00:12:51,612
Juban Elementary?

177
00:12:51,712 --> 00:12:53,848
That's the school
Chibi-Usa goes to.

178
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:02,089
Sailor Moon R!

179
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:18,139
Sailor Moon R!

180
00:13:24,111 --> 00:13:26,080
[Heavy Breathing]

181
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:31,585
Chibi-Usa, Chibi-Usa
are you in here?

182
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:35,923
Hmm, there's no one here.

183
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:37,258
That's odd.

184
00:13:38,259 --> 00:13:41,262
Chibi-Usa? It's me Sailor Moon.

185
00:13:44,765 --> 00:13:45,933
Sailor Moon?

186
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,934
Huh?

187
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:47,601
[Gasp]

188
00:13:47,935 --> 00:13:49,704
Sailor Moon!

189
00:13:50,638 --> 00:13:53,174
[Screams]

190
00:13:53,774 --> 00:13:57,745
[Crying]

191
00:13:58,346 --> 00:14:00,181
Chibi-Usa.

192
00:14:00,281 --> 00:14:02,149
[Whimpering]
[Sigh]

193
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:05,853

[Chuckling]

[Screams]

196
00:14:11,993 --> 00:14:13,661
Welcome, Sailor Moon.

197
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:17,932
That is no way to welcome
someone! I almost had a heart
attack back there!

198
00:14:18,032 --> 00:14:20,701
You're gonna pay for that, and
for destroying school property
too!

199
00:14:20,835 --> 00:14:22,036
In the name of the...

200
00:14:24,171 --> 00:14:27,341
Instead of using what time you
have left to babble nonsense,
you'd be better off saying
prayers for your funeral.

201
00:14:27,441 --> 00:14:29,043
[Gulp] There's two of you?

202
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:30,911
Die!

203
00:14:31,846 --> 00:14:32,713
[Screams]

204

[Gasp]

206
00:14:35,483 --> 00:14:36,751
You can't escape!

207
00:14:39,754 --> 00:14:40,654
[Gasps]

208
00:14:40,721 --> 00:14:42,323
Momo!

209
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:45,926
Momo don't, it's me!

210
00:14:46,027 --> 00:14:46,827
It's no use.

211
00:14:48,562 --> 00:14:51,832
Dark Power has contaminated her
mind! There's no way that you
can get through to her!

212
00:14:52,033 --> 00:14:53,868
[Sighs]

213
00:14:57,071 --> 00:14:59,874
How dare you! How dare you do
this to my friend!

214
00:15:00,074 --> 00:15:01,075
Hah!

215
00:15:01,709 --> 00:15:03,310
Bubble!

216
00:15:05,379 --> 00:15:06,881
Spray!

217
00:15:07,314 --> 00:15:08,249
Huh?

218
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:10,217
We came like you
asked us too.

219
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:13,320
And we're going to put an end to
all of your nonsense right now!

220
00:15:13,821 --> 00:15:16,390
[Chuckles] Feel free to
try and stop us.

221
00:15:19,226 --> 00:15:20,261
He's gone?

222
00:15:20,394 --> 00:15:21,162
Stay on guard.

223
00:15:21,262 --> 00:15:22,063
Mhmm.

224
00:15:22,263 --> 00:15:23,230
Thanks girls.

225
00:15:23,431 --> 00:15:25,166
Sailor Moon, are
you all right?

226
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,836
Looks like your partner
decided to run off!

227
00:15:28,936 --> 00:15:29,937
It's all over for you!

228
00:15:30,404 --> 00:15:32,840
[Laughing]

229
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:34,608
Is that what you
really think?

230
00:15:34,842 --> 00:15:35,342
Hiya!

231
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:37,244
Momo don't!

232
00:15:37,778 --> 00:15:38,579
Stop it!

233
00:15:38,712 --> 00:15:39,580
No, look out!

234
00:15:39,713 --> 00:15:39,914
[Screams]

00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:41,916

00:15:42,216 --> 00:15:43,284
[Screams]

237
00:15:45,052 --> 00:15:45,786
Look out!

238
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:46,620
[Gasps]

239
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,222
Drop dead! Huh!

240
00:15:48,722 --> 00:15:50,324
[Screams]

241
00:15:50,724 --> 00:15:51,325
[All] Jupiter!

242
00:15:51,425 --> 00:15:52,259
Hah!

243
00:15:53,661 --> 00:16:00,601
[All Screaming]

244
00:16:00,801 --> 00:16:03,337
[Wincing] Momo!

[Screaming]

246
00:16:08,976 --> 00:16:10,778
What is that energy?

247
00:16:10,878 --> 00:16:11,879
It's the rabbit!

248
00:16:12,379 --> 00:16:13,147
Chibi-Usa!

249
00:16:17,118 --> 00:16:18,119
[Sighs]

250
00:16:19,286 --> 00:16:21,188
[Sighs] Momo.

00:16:21,789 --> 00:16:24,158
[Whimpering]

252
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:26,560
Chi...Chibi-Usa?

253
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:27,795
Momo!

254
00:16:28,295 --> 00:16:29,997
What's going on here?

255
00:16:30,131 --> 00:16:32,133
What happened to
our school?

256
00:16:32,233 --> 00:16:33,200
Die, Rabbit!

257
00:16:34,969 --> 00:16:35,803
[Gasps]

258
00:16:36,137 --> 00:16:37,872
Chibi-Usa look out!

00:16:37,972 --> 00:16:38,806
[Screams]

260
00:16:38,906 --> 00:16:39,673
Huh?

00:16:39,807 --> 00:16:44,044

[Grunts]

267
00:17:15,776 --> 00:17:23,117
How dare you do this, to Momo,
to my mommy!

268
00:17:23,217 --> 00:17:24,852
[Screams]

269
00:17:28,122 --> 00:17:28,856
Hmm?

270
00:17:28,923 --> 00:17:29,623
Huh?

271
00:17:30,691 --> 00:17:33,127
[Screams]

[Gasps]

273
00:17:35,196 --> 00:17:36,998
What the hell is going on?

274
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:42,470
[Gasps]

275
00:17:43,371 --> 00:17:44,539
[Gasp]

[Sigh]

277
00:17:51,579 --> 00:17:52,947
Chibi-Usa!

278
00:17:54,749 --> 00:17:58,286
Who could've known,
Chibi-Usa possessed
such power.

279
00:17:58,486 --> 00:18:00,655
[Sigh] Momo...

280
00:18:00,755 --> 00:18:03,691
Momo!

281
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,327
[Gasps]

282
00:18:06,828 --> 00:18:10,031
Sailor Mercury, Sailor Venus,
look after Chibi-Usa!

283
00:18:10,598 --> 00:18:13,534
Those two are absolutely
unforgivable!

284
00:18:17,672 --> 00:18:21,576
The Rabbit displayed a kind of
power we've never seen before.

285
00:18:21,676 --> 00:18:23,177
Interesting.

286
00:18:24,879 --> 00:18:28,650
Now that we known what the
Rabbit is capable of, it would
be a shame to destroy her.

287
00:18:29,751 --> 00:18:32,654
It appears you have a specific
plan in mind.

288
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,395
Where are you two hiding?

289
00:18:41,663 --> 00:18:42,997
Come on out!

290
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:45,033
[Laughing]

291
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:47,368
[Grunting] Die!

[Gasps]

293
00:18:51,906 --> 00:18:56,244
Turning the hallowed halls of
learning into a battlefield is
an unforgivable act of violence.

294
00:18:56,744 --> 00:18:58,146
Tuxedo Mask!

295
00:18:59,247 --> 00:19:02,717
Now, Sailor Moon, teach them the
ABC's of true justice.

296
00:19:03,084 --> 00:19:03,785
Right!

297
00:19:21,169 --> 00:19:22,103
[Grunting]

298
00:19:23,671 --> 00:19:29,110
[Screaming] Sparkling Wide

[Screams]

302
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:54,135
We did it!

303
00:19:56,137 --> 00:19:59,140
Curses! Foiled by
those girls again!

304
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,477
I've had enough, I'll crush you
myself!

305
00:20:02,577 --> 00:20:05,046
Ahh! Prepare to die!

306
00:20:06,714 --> 00:20:08,549
Hold on, Esmeraude.

307
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:12,053
Prince Demande! Why are you
stopping me?

308
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:17,658
Plans have changed. I need you
to return here, Esmeraude.

309
00:20:18,392 --> 00:20:21,229
But I was just about to take
care of...

310
00:20:21,329 --> 00:20:23,564
That is an order, return!

311
00:20:26,167 --> 00:20:27,401
Hmph!

312
00:20:28,669 --> 00:20:31,005
Just because I've been called
back, doesn't mean you've won!

313
00:20:31,105 --> 00:20:36,444
Once we decide to strike, you
Guardians won't last a minute!
[Evil Laughter]

314
00:20:45,787 --> 00:20:47,321
Does it hurt?

315
00:20:47,421 --> 00:20:49,457
Not much, I'll be fine.

316
00:20:49,724 --> 00:20:53,628
Looks like we switched places
from yesterday. [Giggling]

317
00:20:54,328 --> 00:20:55,997
[Giggles]

318
00:21:11,345 --> 00:21:15,550
I have to go to the future! I
have to go so I can rescue my
Mommy!

319
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:16,517
[Gasp]

320
00:21:17,351 --> 00:21:18,653
But how are you
going to do that?

321
00:21:19,287 --> 00:21:21,656
By using this Space-Time Key.

322
00:21:23,157 --> 00:21:27,195
I wasn't able to make it work
before, but I bet it'll work
now.

323
00:21:30,031 --> 00:21:32,967
But I can't save her myself, I
need your help!

324
00:21:33,801 --> 00:21:37,672
Will you please help me by
coming to the future.

325
00:21:38,739 --> 00:21:40,508
Come with you?

326
00:21:49,116 --> 00:21:50,618
We'll help you Chibi-Usa.

327
00:21:54,622 --> 00:21:56,657
We'll go. Together.

328
00:21:56,791 --> 00:21:58,226
We're all ready to do this.

329
00:21:58,326 --> 00:21:59,460
Yes count me in!

330
00:22:01,229 --> 00:22:05,533
Me too. Unless we go to the
future we may never learn what
our enemy's real goal is.

331
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,802
All of you make it
sound so simple.

332
00:22:07,902 --> 00:22:10,304
But it's actually
very risky.

333
00:22:10,438 --> 00:22:11,539
It doesn't matter.

334
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:14,609
All of us have already made up
our minds to go.

335
00:22:14,709 --> 00:22:16,677
We're with you, Chibi-Usa.

336
00:22:17,712 --> 00:22:19,080
Thank you.

337
00:22:19,847 --> 00:22:23,117
It's my fault that my Mommy's in
trouble.

338
00:22:23,551 --> 00:22:28,122
Mommy! I'm coming! We're coming
to rescue you!

339
00:24:12,493 --> 00:24:15,229
The Sailor Guardians are
heading to the future!

340
00:24:15,329 --> 00:24:17,098
Don't get lost, Usagi!

341
00:24:17,231 --> 00:24:18,733
Please, like that'll happen.

342
00:24:18,833 --> 00:24:20,768
Huh? Hey, what's that door?

343
00:24:20,868 --> 00:24:23,004
That's the Door of
Space and Time.

344
00:24:23,104 --> 00:24:25,006
Sailor Moon, Look out!

345
00:24:25,106 --> 00:24:28,743
What?! But you're...Sailor
Pluto! What're you doing here?!

346
00:24:28,843 --> 00:24:31,212
Next time on Sailor Moon R!

347
00:24:31,312 --> 00:24:34,682
"Journey to the Future: Battle
in the Space-Time Corridor."

348
00:24:35,049 --> 00:24:37,351
The moonlight is a messenger
of love.
