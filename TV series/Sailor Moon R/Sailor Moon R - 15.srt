1
00:01:57,045 --> 00:01:59,278
I don't understand,
Mamo.

2
00:01:59,311 --> 00:02:02,345
I thought we promised
we'd love each other
forever.

3
00:02:02,378 --> 00:02:06,378
So how can you be
telling me now, out of
the blue that you want to
break up with me?

4
00:02:06,411 --> 00:02:07,311
Hey!

5
00:02:07,345 --> 00:02:10,011
Can't you see I'm
devastated, here?!

6
00:02:10,045 --> 00:02:12,278
Show some respect, you
stupid monster!

7
00:02:12,311 --> 00:02:15,245
In the name of the
Moon... I'll punish you!

8
00:02:21,078 --> 00:02:26,278
Usagi Devastated:
Mamoru Declares a
Break-Up!

9
00:02:30,678 --> 00:02:37,345
[panting]

10
00:02:37,378 --> 00:02:39,011
Usako!

11
00:02:39,045 --> 00:02:42,045
I'm impressed. So you
out for a jog, too?

12
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:44,111
Mamo!

13
00:02:45,478 --> 00:02:47,045
Mmm-mm...

14
00:02:47,078 --> 00:02:52,511
What a nice surprise to
run into you like this,
it makes me feel so
very lucky!

15
00:02:52,545 --> 00:02:57,245
Looks like you and I are
meant to be together no
matter what. Huh, Usako?

16
00:02:57,278 --> 00:02:58,545
Oh, Mamo...

17
00:03:00,445 --> 00:03:01,411
Hey!

18
00:03:02,511 --> 00:03:04,445
Hey, you two! It's way
too early for that stuff!

19
00:03:04,478 --> 00:03:08,045
And Usagi! Have you
forgotten what's going
on?!

20
00:03:08,078 --> 00:03:09,911
Oh, that's right! We
have a problem!

21
00:03:09,945 --> 00:03:11,611
Chibi-Usa's gone
missing!

22
00:03:11,645 --> 00:03:12,511
[gasping]

23
00:03:13,678 --> 00:03:15,945
Do you think she got
kidnapped by that strange
woman?!

24
00:03:15,978 --> 00:03:17,611
I don't think so, but
who knows?

25
00:03:17,645 --> 00:03:22,311
At any rate, it's far
too dangerous for that
little girl to be out by
herself!

26
00:03:37,078 --> 00:03:38,311
There she is.

27
00:03:42,478 --> 00:03:45,211
Daddy... Mommy...

28
00:03:45,245 --> 00:03:46,778
Chibi-Usa...

29
00:03:46,811 --> 00:03:51,945
Why'd you run off? No
one knew where you went,
so we've all been really
worried.

30
00:03:51,978 --> 00:03:53,911
Leave me alone.
Go away!

31
00:03:53,945 --> 00:03:55,911
Ohh...

32
00:03:57,678 --> 00:03:59,045
Don't be sad.

33
00:03:59,078 --> 00:04:00,045
Huh?

34
00:04:00,078 --> 00:04:03,011
Come on. I'll
walk you home.

35
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:05,611
Hm!

36
00:04:06,111 --> 00:04:07,678
Hmm...

37
00:04:07,711 --> 00:04:10,078
Great. Now, let's
get going.

38
00:04:12,445 --> 00:04:13,345
[gasping]

39
00:04:19,178 --> 00:04:20,311
Mamo?

40
00:04:20,345 --> 00:04:21,378
Uh!

41
00:04:21,411 --> 00:04:22,378
You okay?

42
00:04:22,411 --> 00:04:25,978
Yeah, I'm fine.
Everything's good.

43
00:04:28,011 --> 00:04:28,611
Huh?

44
00:04:34,111 --> 00:04:37,678
Chibi-Usa... Get down-
Mamo's carried you long
enough!

45
00:04:37,711 --> 00:04:39,378
[sticking her tongue out]

46
00:04:39,411 --> 00:04:43,011
You really need to stop
calling me Chibi-Usa
already...

47
00:04:44,178 --> 00:04:46,245
After all, my
name is Usagi.

48
00:04:46,278 --> 00:04:49,645
What are you, nuts? I'm
the only Usagi here!

49
00:04:49,678 --> 00:04:53,911
And that nice guy who's
been carrying you-is my
boyfriend Mamo.

50
00:04:53,945 --> 00:04:58,945
Nuh-uh Mamo's gonna be
my boyfriend, not yours!

51
00:04:59,211 --> 00:05:03,078
You don't know what
you're saying. Mamo
loves only me.

52
00:05:03,111 --> 00:05:09,145
I want you to get this
through your thick, pink
skull!

53
00:05:09,978 --> 00:05:12,245
We're deeply and
hopelessly in love
with each other!

54
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:16,578
So don't you even try
to flirt with him,
you got it?

55
00:05:16,611 --> 00:05:20,178
Just keep your grimy,
little rabbit paws off
of him.

56
00:05:20,211 --> 00:05:22,445
Come on, Usako,
let it go.

57
00:05:22,478 --> 00:05:26,278
Chibi-Usa's just a
little kid who's lonely
and wants some attention.

58
00:05:26,311 --> 00:05:30,645
Heyyyy. Mamo, do you
know that you just called
me "Chibi-Usa" too!?

59
00:05:30,678 --> 00:05:34,411
Sorry 'bout that,
but--

60
00:05:34,445 --> 00:05:38,311
I think Chibi-Usa is a
really nice name. I like
it.

61
00:05:38,345 --> 00:05:40,145
Really? You mean it?

62
00:05:40,178 --> 00:05:42,445
Yeah. I think it's
cute.

63
00:05:42,478 --> 00:05:44,211
Then call me Chibi-Usa!

64
00:05:44,245 --> 00:05:48,345
[chuckling]
Huh?

65
00:05:48,611 --> 00:05:49,645
Hey, what's
wrong?

66
00:05:49,678 --> 00:05:54,445
Oooookay, you two go and
have lots of fun together.

67
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:57,545
And while you're at it,
why don't you just go and
get married?

68
00:05:57,578 --> 00:05:59,578
Hey Usako, just what's
gotten into you!?

69
00:05:59,611 --> 00:06:01,245
What're you so angry
about?

70
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:02,378
I'm not angry!

71
00:06:02,411 --> 00:06:03,211
[sighing]

72
00:06:04,378 --> 00:06:07,411
My, my, Chibi-Usa...
Where in the world were
you?

73
00:06:07,445 --> 00:06:12,011
You can't go running
off without telling someone.
We've been looking everywhere
for you!

74
00:06:12,045 --> 00:06:13,678
I'm sorry...

75
00:06:13,711 --> 00:06:17,978
Well now we've found
her and she's safe so
everything's alright.
Anyway...

76
00:06:18,011 --> 00:06:21,178
Usagi, I believe I've
met this gentleman
before.

77
00:06:21,211 --> 00:06:25,978
Oh! Well, uh... This is
my good friend, Mamoru
Chiba.

78
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:27,345
Hi!

79
00:06:27,378 --> 00:06:30,145
Well! It is so nice to
finally meet you .

80
00:06:30,178 --> 00:06:34,378
Wow... He seems way too
good looking to be
Usagi's boyfriend.

81
00:06:34,411 --> 00:06:37,978
What was that?! He's
your boyfriend?! Is that
true Usagi?!?

82
00:06:38,011 --> 00:06:40,545
Well, I, uh--

83
00:06:40,578 --> 00:06:46,011
I was just in the middle
of my morning run, so if
you'll excuse me-I'll
be on my way. Bye!

84
00:06:46,045 --> 00:06:47,945
Wait! Hold on young man!

85
00:06:47,978 --> 00:06:50,378
Hey! Come back here!

86
00:06:50,411 --> 00:06:51,411
Usagi...!

87
00:06:51,445 --> 00:06:54,245
You've got good taste.
That young man's quite
hot.

88
00:06:54,278 --> 00:06:55,845
Huh?!

89
00:06:55,878 --> 00:06:59,345
Next time bring him when
your dad's not here, so
we get a chance to know
him.

90
00:06:59,378 --> 00:07:00,211
Okay...

91
00:07:00,245 --> 00:07:01,445
Honey!

92
00:07:01,478 --> 00:07:06,511
Our little girl...
Usagi's become a...
delinquent! [sobbing]

93
00:07:07,045 --> 00:07:11,511
Oh my! Stop being so
dramatic, dear. It's
just a boy...

94
00:07:11,545 --> 00:07:12,811
But our daughter's
only 14--

95
00:07:12,845 --> 00:07:17,378
Man, Dad sure is taking
this hard. Way to go,
stupid Usagi.

96
00:07:18,511 --> 00:07:19,411
So...!

97
00:07:19,445 --> 00:07:21,945
Huh?

98
00:07:21,978 --> 00:07:25,278
Could I... have
something to eat?
I'm hungry.

99
00:07:27,478 --> 00:07:29,411
Uh--who are you?

100
00:07:29,445 --> 00:07:30,578
Huh?

101
00:07:30,611 --> 00:07:34,445
Honey, is this girl
a... relative of yours?

102
00:07:34,478 --> 00:07:36,145
I'm not sure.

103
00:07:36,178 --> 00:07:36,945
[gasping]

104
00:07:36,978 --> 00:07:39,245
Huh...?

105
00:07:39,278 --> 00:07:41,278
Hey, do we
know you?

106
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:42,211
[gasping]

107
00:07:42,245 --> 00:07:43,111
Uh?!

108
00:07:50,478 --> 00:07:51,311
Don't move!

109
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:52,111
Huh?!

110
00:07:53,045 --> 00:07:56,211
Luna P... transform!

111
00:08:01,311 --> 00:08:02,578
Heh?!

112
00:08:08,511 --> 00:08:12,045
[moaning]

113
00:08:12,078 --> 00:08:14,511
Whaa?!!! Huh?

114
00:08:14,545 --> 00:08:16,445
She's got them all
hypnotized!

115
00:08:16,478 --> 00:08:18,345
[growling]

116
00:08:18,378 --> 00:08:20,878
Oowwwww!

117
00:08:21,278 --> 00:08:25,011
Why'd you do that
to me, Luna?!

118
00:08:25,045 --> 00:08:27,678
I'm your very close
relative Chibi-Usa.

119
00:08:27,711 --> 00:08:29,611
Oh, that's right!

120
00:08:29,645 --> 00:08:32,311
It's true! How could
we have ever forgotten
that?

121
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,978
We're cousins!-For sure!

122
00:08:34,011 --> 00:08:35,945
Hold it
right there!

123
00:08:35,978 --> 00:08:39,511
[growling]
So you've been keeping
them hypnotized?!

124
00:08:39,545 --> 00:08:41,011
All this time!

125
00:08:41,045 --> 00:08:42,345
Usagi.

126
00:08:42,378 --> 00:08:46,311
Why're you picking on
Chibi-Usa by making up
nonsense like that!?

127
00:08:46,345 --> 00:08:48,078
Be nice to your cousin.

128
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:50,211
How many times do we
have to tell you that!?

129
00:08:50,245 --> 00:08:52,311
[grunting]

130
00:08:52,345 --> 00:08:53,945
[sticking her tongue out]

131
00:08:53,978 --> 00:08:57,111
[screaming]

132
00:08:57,145 --> 00:08:58,145
[sighing]

133
00:08:58,178 --> 00:08:59,745
Hey, you know...

134
00:08:59,778 --> 00:09:03,978
This head thing looks just
like you, Luna. It even has
a crescent-shaped bald spot.

135
00:09:04,011 --> 00:09:04,611
See?

136
00:09:06,545 --> 00:09:08,645
Oh noo...

137
00:09:18,145 --> 00:09:20,311
Master Rubeus...?

138
00:09:20,345 --> 00:09:21,945
Did you call me, sir?

139
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:25,078
Come here, Berthier...
look.

140
00:09:25,311 --> 00:09:29,478
Is that a hologram of the
future city-Crystal
Tokyo?

141
00:09:29,511 --> 00:09:34,578
Yes, and our goal is to
crush this despicable
future city as soon
as we're able.

142
00:09:34,611 --> 00:09:41,311
To do that, it is crucial
that we find and erase both
the Rabbit and the Silver
Crystal from this timeline.

143
00:09:41,345 --> 00:09:45,945
I understand that sir.
But we still can't seem
to locate either of them.

144
00:09:45,978 --> 00:09:51,545
I know. But I believe there
still is another way for us
to destroy Crystal Tokyo.

145
00:09:53,245 --> 00:09:57,945
These are the Crystal
Points, from which
Crystal Tokyo's force
field is generated.

146
00:09:57,978 --> 00:10:03,345
I have discovered
the locations in this era
that will one day become
these Crystal Points.

147
00:10:04,711 --> 00:10:06,278
Is that one of them?

148
00:10:06,311 --> 00:10:10,111
Berthier, Go turn that
into a Dark Power area.

149
00:10:10,145 --> 00:10:13,178
And then the future
Crystal Tokyo will end
up destroyed...

150
00:10:13,211 --> 00:10:18,478
Yes! Crumbled into
nothing but ruins.
[chuckling]

151
00:10:27,145 --> 00:10:28,308
[gasping]

152
00:10:28,308 --> 00:10:30,278
[grunting in pain]

153
00:10:30,311 --> 00:10:31,645
Now I get it.

154
00:10:33,378 --> 00:10:35,545
Then Usako will be...

155
00:10:35,578 --> 00:10:38,678
[groaning]
I flunked another
test.

156
00:10:38,711 --> 00:10:41,911
Huh? It's Mamo.

157
00:10:41,945 --> 00:10:44,678
Ma...!

158
00:10:44,711 --> 00:10:46,578
Mamo!

159
00:10:46,611 --> 00:10:47,645
[gasping]

160
00:10:48,378 --> 00:10:50,211
[giggling]

161
00:10:51,511 --> 00:10:55,311
Another chance meeting!
I love it when this happens.

162
00:10:55,345 --> 00:10:56,378
Stop it.

163
00:10:57,978 --> 00:11:00,878
Stop being so
affectionate.

164
00:11:01,545 --> 00:11:05,645
Oh, sorry... You're
right, it is kinda early
in the day...

165
00:11:05,678 --> 00:11:07,278
That is not what I
meant.

166
00:11:07,311 --> 00:11:08,645
Huh?

167
00:11:08,678 --> 00:11:12,678
It's more than that- I
just don't feel that
way about you anymore.

168
00:11:12,711 --> 00:11:16,345
What do you mean by
that?

169
00:11:16,378 --> 00:11:18,545
It's over between you
and me!

170
00:11:30,378 --> 00:11:32,211
Sailor Moon...

171
00:11:32,245 --> 00:11:33,378
...'R'!

172
00:11:47,432 --> 00:11:49,932
Sailor Moon! R!

173
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,265
Mamoru broke up with
you?!

174
00:11:54,299 --> 00:11:56,199
So what in the world
happened?

175
00:11:56,232 --> 00:11:58,265
I have no idea.

176
00:11:58,299 --> 00:12:04,065
Don't be sad. He
didn't mean it. He was
in a bad mood, that's
all. Cheer up.

177
00:12:04,099 --> 00:12:09,265
She's right. After all-
You two are a couple
whose love has
transcended time.

178
00:12:09,299 --> 00:12:10,899
Here's a
thought...

179
00:12:10,932 --> 00:12:15,999
It's possible Mamoru
was forcing himself to
say that to you for your
own sake.

180
00:12:16,032 --> 00:12:17,399
What do you mean?

181
00:12:17,432 --> 00:12:19,932
Well, he cares
for her.

182
00:12:19,965 --> 00:12:25,799
He probably wanted Usagi
to study more... so he
broke up with her to help
her grades...

183
00:12:26,232 --> 00:12:27,832
Or maybe not.

184
00:12:27,865 --> 00:12:29,299
[chuckling]

185
00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:31,232
Don't worry,
Usagi.

186
00:12:31,265 --> 00:12:36,199
Mamoru truly loves you.
You know that. He'd never
wanna hurt you.

187
00:12:37,865 --> 00:12:39,365
Thanks Rei.

188
00:12:40,565 --> 00:12:43,899
Um-hm. Good job, you're
getting the hang of
it...!

189
00:12:43,932 --> 00:12:47,199
Since you'll be going to
Shingo's school, you need
to do lots of studying.

190
00:12:47,232 --> 00:12:48,332
I will.

191
00:12:51,532 --> 00:12:53,065
Hm?

192
00:12:55,132 --> 00:12:55,999
Uh--

193
00:12:56,032 --> 00:12:56,899
Unh--

194
00:13:01,865 --> 00:13:03,932
Why did you
come by?

195
00:13:03,965 --> 00:13:08,432
About this afternoon...
I'm sorry.

196
00:13:08,465 --> 00:13:14,365
I guess, I was kind of in
my own world, so I must not
have noticed you were in a
bad mood.

197
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,132
That wasn't it at all.

198
00:13:16,165 --> 00:13:17,365
Huh?

199
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:21,065
I told you I just don't
have any feelings for you
anymore.

200
00:13:21,099 --> 00:13:26,365
But Mamo... If this is
about studying harder,
I can do that...

201
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:30,465
You're not getting it.
I want our relationship
to be over with!

202
00:13:31,965 --> 00:13:33,899
But Mamo...

203
00:13:33,932 --> 00:13:37,399
How can you, expect me
to believe that..?

204
00:13:37,432 --> 00:13:43,765
After all, you're Prince
Endymion and... well... I'm
Princess Serenity...

205
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:47,465
We've been in love
since before we were even
born...

206
00:13:47,499 --> 00:13:50,965
I am so sick and tired
of hearing that story!

207
00:13:50,999 --> 00:13:55,465
Just because all of that
may have happened in the
past, doesn't mean I have
to be with you now!

208
00:13:55,499 --> 00:13:57,732
I don't--
[gasping]

209
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:06,265
It looks like
Chibi-Usa's here.
Isn't she?

210
00:14:06,299 --> 00:14:10,432
Mamo, could this be
because... You like
Chibi-Usa more than me?

211
00:14:10,465 --> 00:14:12,099
That's ridiculous...

212
00:14:12,132 --> 00:14:13,499
You're right.

213
00:14:13,532 --> 00:14:19,265
I'm sorry Mamo... I'm
sorry that you had to
deal with me for so long.

214
00:14:19,299 --> 00:14:20,932
[crying]

215
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:29,199
Usako... I'm sorry...

216
00:14:55,265 --> 00:14:58,299
[crying]

217
00:14:58,332 --> 00:15:01,765
Mom...

218
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:08,365
I'm sorry... I won't be
able to bring Mamo...
home with me to visit
anymore...

219
00:15:09,499 --> 00:15:17,032
[crying]

220
00:15:21,265 --> 00:15:23,932
[screaming]

221
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:41,932
Are you there? Droid
Atsugessho?

222
00:15:41,965 --> 00:15:43,932
Yes. I am here.

223
00:15:43,965 --> 00:15:49,465
Atsugessho... I want you
to work here at this
newly renovated store and
sell my cosmetic products.

224
00:15:49,499 --> 00:15:55,065
It's my special brand
called Fancy Fukuwarai
Series. It will turn
even the plainest-looking

225
00:15:55,099 --> 00:15:56,499
girls into stunning
beauties first...

226
00:15:56,532 --> 00:16:01,032
then their
skin will be covered in
acne and their hair will
turn gray.

227
00:16:01,065 --> 00:16:05,065
It will leave every
woman old and hideous.

228
00:16:05,099 --> 00:16:07,265
That sounds
delightful...

229
00:16:08,065 --> 00:16:13,865
And by doing that, this
area will no longer
function as a
Crystal Point.

230
00:16:13,899 --> 00:16:20,765
In fact, our energy will
be in complete control of
this special place in the
Crystal Tokyo of the future.

231
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:22,099
(Laughs)

232
00:16:26,265 --> 00:16:28,932
Time to go to work...

233
00:16:28,965 --> 00:16:32,099
These should bring in
lots of customers.

234
00:16:32,132 --> 00:16:34,465
Oh, dear!

235
00:16:34,499 --> 00:16:36,865
What a nasty wind!

236
00:16:53,065 --> 00:16:55,265
Where's she going...?

237
00:16:55,299 --> 00:16:58,865
Welcome! And how can I
help you?

238
00:16:58,899 --> 00:17:00,332
I, uh...

239
00:17:00,365 --> 00:17:03,899
Oh... Your face looks so
sad-you've been crying.

240
00:17:03,932 --> 00:17:05,632
Huh...?

241
00:17:05,665 --> 00:17:09,099
Now first, you should
cleanse your face with
this facial wash. After
that, use this skin

242
00:17:09,132 --> 00:17:10,899
toner, lotion and
finishing cream.

243
00:17:10,932 --> 00:17:14,832
Once your skin is
primed, add some blush on
your cheeks, some fresh
color to your lips and--

244
00:17:14,865 --> 00:17:16,765
Hold on...!

245
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:20,465
Wait. Are you trying
to tell me that if I look
prettier, then my boyfriend
will like me again?

246
00:17:20,499 --> 00:17:25,432
Well if you really want
a man to say that he loves
you, you need to go even
heavier on your makeup.

247
00:17:25,465 --> 00:17:27,232
But--

248
00:17:27,265 --> 00:17:32,532
Mamo's not going to say
that he loves me just
because I suddenly change
the way that I look.

249
00:17:32,565 --> 00:17:36,899
Oh, yes! I'd say if
your looks improve, your
man will surely tell you
he loves you.

250
00:17:36,932 --> 00:17:38,832
That's how all men are!

251
00:17:38,865 --> 00:17:41,099
You're wrong!

252
00:17:41,132 --> 00:17:44,065
My Mamo isn't like that!
You don't know anything
about him! And if you
really believe that

253
00:17:44,099 --> 00:17:46,232
stuff, then you must be
stupid!!

254
00:17:46,499 --> 00:17:49,532
I don't want any of your
silly makeup!

255
00:17:49,565 --> 00:17:50,965
Hold it!

256
00:17:50,999 --> 00:17:54,232
You don't think you
can walk away after
talking to me like that...

257
00:17:54,265 --> 00:17:55,199
But I--

258
00:17:55,232 --> 00:17:57,899
Hold still you mouthy
brat! Don't resist!

259
00:17:57,932 --> 00:18:01,099
You come into this shop,
you put on the make up,
you got it?!

260
00:18:01,132 --> 00:18:02,499
But I don't want to!

261
00:18:02,532 --> 00:18:05,465
Now you've chased away
all my customers!

262
00:18:05,499 --> 00:18:09,132
That's not my
fault-You're the one
trying to force me to
use your makeup!

263
00:18:09,165 --> 00:18:10,732
You're going to
use it.

264
00:18:14,432 --> 00:18:18,565
Ahhhh! That's not
an improvement!

265
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:21,165
Now it's your turn!
Put it on!!

266
00:18:21,199 --> 00:18:23,099
[struggling]

267
00:18:23,399 --> 00:18:24,232
Luna!

268
00:18:24,265 --> 00:18:26,765
She's an enemy!
Transform now, Usagi!

269
00:18:27,099 --> 00:18:27,999
Okay!

270
00:18:28,265 --> 00:18:33,199
Moon Crystal Power Make
Up!

271
00:19:11,465 --> 00:19:13,065
[grunting]

272
00:19:13,099 --> 00:19:15,532
Curse her. Where'd
she go?!
[gasping]

273
00:19:15,565 --> 00:19:16,832
Who are you?!

274
00:19:16,865 --> 00:19:21,132
I am the Pretty Guardian
who fights for love and
for justice.

275
00:19:21,165 --> 00:19:22,899
I am Sailor Moon!

276
00:19:22,932 --> 00:19:27,465
You took advantage of a
girl's wish to be loved
by a boy. Trying to force
her to buy your

277
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:30,265
cheap-looking cosmetics
is just unforgivable!

278
00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:32,999
In the name of the
Moon, I'll punish you!

279
00:19:33,465 --> 00:19:38,499
Hunh! Whoever you are,
now that you know our plan
to destroy the future
city, you're dead!

280
00:19:38,532 --> 00:19:40,865
Plan to destroy the
future city!?

281
00:19:40,899 --> 00:19:42,799
But first you need a
make over!

282
00:19:46,199 --> 00:19:47,365
Ahhhh!

283
00:19:49,199 --> 00:19:49,899
Ahhh!

284
00:19:49,932 --> 00:19:50,965
Come here!

285
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:53,365
[panicking]

286
00:19:54,399 --> 00:19:56,999
[struggling]

287
00:19:58,532 --> 00:19:59,165
[gasping]

288
00:19:59,199 --> 00:20:00,432
[laughing]

289
00:20:00,465 --> 00:20:02,399
[meowing]

290
00:20:02,965 --> 00:20:04,432
Nice make over.

291
00:20:05,399 --> 00:20:06,799
Luna!

292
00:20:06,832 --> 00:20:09,799
And now it's
your turn.

293
00:20:10,399 --> 00:20:12,065
[chuckling]

294
00:20:13,365 --> 00:20:15,099
Huh?!

295
00:20:15,132 --> 00:20:19,865
A young girl's
complexion is youthful
and fresh! Heavy makeup
does nothing but obscure it!

296
00:20:19,899 --> 00:20:24,499
Silence you! Greasy
skin, acne, and roughness
all demand such makeup!

297
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:26,099
Hm!

298
00:20:27,932 --> 00:20:29,732
Maybe you need
a makeover!

299
00:20:34,432 --> 00:20:34,932
[struggling]

300
00:20:35,299 --> 00:20:37,999
I must redo
my face!

301
00:20:38,032 --> 00:20:39,999
Sailor Moon! Finish her!

302
00:20:40,032 --> 00:20:41,165
Okay.

303
00:20:58,899 --> 00:21:02,032
Redoing my face isn't
really that easy.

304
00:21:04,065 --> 00:21:07,499
Moon Princess...!

305
00:21:07,532 --> 00:21:10,499
... Halation!

306
00:21:14,065 --> 00:21:17,132
But I--I haven't
finished my face yet!

307
00:21:32,832 --> 00:21:33,532
Farewell.

308
00:21:33,565 --> 00:21:35,065
No, wait!

309
00:21:35,099 --> 00:21:39,199
Tuxedo Mask-You were
lying when you said you
don't love me anymore,
right?

310
00:21:39,232 --> 00:21:42,532
After all, you did come
to my rescue once
again...

311
00:21:42,565 --> 00:21:45,465
Those are two different
matters.

312
00:21:45,499 --> 00:21:48,532
[crying]

313
00:21:48,565 --> 00:21:51,232
Then please, Mamo...

314
00:21:51,265 --> 00:21:55,965
Please tell me... what's
the reason you don't like
me anymore?

315
00:21:56,465 --> 00:21:59,065
I don't like girls
who are weak!

316
00:22:00,265 --> 00:22:01,499
Farewell.

317
00:22:02,232 --> 00:22:03,399
Mamo...

318
00:22:04,265 --> 00:22:07,432
I'm sorry, Usako...

319
00:22:14,132 --> 00:22:17,832
Sailor Moon! There are
some people lying
unconscious in the store
basement.

320
00:22:17,865 --> 00:22:19,399
Let's go get them
out of there!

321
00:22:19,999 --> 00:22:21,799
Sailor Moon?

322
00:22:22,365 --> 00:22:24,432
I understand, Mamo...

323
00:22:24,465 --> 00:22:30,299
I know what I must do. I
will make myself stronger
and win back your heart!

324
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,060
You okay, Ami?

325
00:24:13,094 --> 00:24:14,027
Huh?

326
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:15,994
Is this about going to
study in Germany?

327
00:24:16,027 --> 00:24:17,694
I know it's your
dream, Ami.

328
00:24:17,727 --> 00:24:19,927
But I can't just go
there and leave everyone.

329
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,727
Well you can't give up
on your dream!

330
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,994
But Usagi...

331
00:24:23,027 --> 00:24:25,360
We all feel the same
way. And we want you to
go for it!

332
00:24:25,394 --> 00:24:28,860
After all. no matter
where you are, we'll
always be together!

333
00:24:28,894 --> 00:24:33,694
Next time on Sailor Moon
R: "A Guardian's Friendship!
Goodbye, Ami!"

334
00:24:33,727 --> 00:24:36,627
The moonlight is a
messenger of love.
