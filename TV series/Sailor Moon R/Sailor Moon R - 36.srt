1
00:01:57,618 --> 00:02:02,360
It's time to begin our
journey into the unknown.
We're ready to leave for
the future!

2
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:07,369
We don't know what danger
lies ahead or how we'll
be able to deal with it.
But no matter what happens,

3
00:02:07,369 --> 00:02:10,375
we won't give up until
we save Chibi-Usa's
mother!

4
00:02:10,375 --> 00:02:12,513
O Door of Space
and Time...

5
00:02:12,546 --> 00:02:15,451
Show us the way
to the future!

6
00:02:18,657 --> 00:02:21,563
Please! Please,
everyone!

7
00:02:21,697 --> 00:02:23,734
Rescue my mommy!

8
00:02:28,777 --> 00:02:31,314
[gasps]

9
00:02:39,396 --> 00:02:40,698
[screaming]

10
00:02:40,732 --> 00:02:42,268
Everyone!

11
00:02:44,807 --> 00:02:48,713
Sailor Mars!
Sailor Mercury!

12
00:02:49,247 --> 00:02:53,455
Sailor Jupiter!
Sailor Venus!

13
00:02:55,426 --> 00:02:57,530
Sailor Moon!

14
00:02:58,398 --> 00:03:00,535
No! No!

15
00:03:01,304 --> 00:03:03,675
No!

16
00:03:17,801 --> 00:03:21,741
"Journey to the Future:
Battle in the Space-
Time Corridor."

17
00:03:26,216 --> 00:03:30,658
Until my dream last night,
all I could ever think about
was returning to the future...

18
00:03:30,691 --> 00:03:35,433
...to rescue Mommy with
the help of the Sailor
Guardians. But now I'm
thinking...

19
00:03:35,467 --> 00:03:40,744
...the Black Moon Clan
may be way too powerful.
What if Sailor Moon and
the others get defeated?

20
00:03:42,613 --> 00:03:45,686
Mommy! What should
I do? I'm scared!

21
00:03:47,355 --> 00:03:48,457
Chibi-Usa...

22
00:03:49,593 --> 00:03:50,662
Mamo...

23
00:03:51,697 --> 00:03:53,434
What are you doing
here? Is something
wrong?

24
00:03:53,467 --> 00:03:55,705
Let's go. Everyone's
waiting for you.

25
00:03:56,272 --> 00:03:58,476
Uh... Yes, but...

26
00:04:00,714 --> 00:04:02,283
Chibi-Usa...

27
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,660
You're going to rescue
your mommy. That's all
you ever talk about. So
don't get cold feet now.

28
00:04:08,261 --> 00:04:13,638
Believe in your strength.
And in the strength of your
friends. You must have faith
that all of you can do this.

29
00:04:14,473 --> 00:04:16,777
C'mon. Let's go
together to the
future.

30
00:04:17,478 --> 00:04:20,351
I'll be with you,
to keep you safe.

31
00:04:20,417 --> 00:04:21,786
Thank you, Mamo.

32
00:04:22,488 --> 00:04:23,456
We're good?

33
00:04:24,758 --> 00:04:26,228
Yeah.

34
00:04:28,466 --> 00:04:30,636
I wonder what's
keeping Chibi-Usa?

35
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:33,908
Sailor Moon, how come
she didn't come here
with you?

36
00:04:34,377 --> 00:04:37,448
She told me to go on
ahead because she had
something she needed
to do.

37
00:04:37,482 --> 00:04:39,486
I sure hope nothing
happened to her.

38
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:41,256
I'll go look for her.

39
00:04:41,289 --> 00:04:42,759
I'm gonna go
with you.

40
00:04:43,727 --> 00:04:45,530
That won't be
necessary.

41
00:04:48,636 --> 00:04:51,241
I've got her right
here. Sorry we're
late.

42
00:04:51,508 --> 00:04:54,414
Chibi-Usa! What
took you so long?

43
00:04:55,014 --> 00:04:58,020
You know how it is when
you're going away. I
had things to do.

44
00:04:58,254 --> 00:05:00,258
Okay. Is everyone
ready to go now?

45
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:02,662
Chibi-Usa, we're all
counting on you.

46
00:05:02,695 --> 00:05:03,631
All right.

47
00:05:07,237 --> 00:05:08,740
O Guardian of time!

48
00:05:08,773 --> 00:05:13,615
Tear apart the heavens
and open wide for me the
Door of Space and Time!

49
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:17,390
I summon thee by
your true name.

50
00:05:18,826 --> 00:05:21,397
Omnipotent God
of Time...

51
00:05:24,636 --> 00:05:27,608
Father of the
Guardian. O
Chronos!

52
00:05:27,776 --> 00:05:30,614
Guide us on our
journey!

53
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:33,419
Protect these
travelers!

54
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:42,937
Grant us the
path of light!

55
00:06:05,512 --> 00:06:07,683
I-Is this the future?

56
00:06:08,685 --> 00:06:10,689
Where did
everyone go?

57
00:06:19,438 --> 00:06:20,707
What's that?

58
00:06:23,378 --> 00:06:24,915
Stop right there!

59
00:06:26,451 --> 00:06:30,325
Those who violate the
taboo and approach the
Door of Space and Time...

60
00:06:30,358 --> 00:06:32,395
...must be eliminated!

61
00:06:33,598 --> 00:06:34,099
Huh?

62
00:06:35,368 --> 00:06:38,340
Wait! Just a minute!
Let me explain why I'm
here!

63
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:40,477
Prepare to die!

64
00:06:40,477 --> 00:06:41,379
[gasp]

65
00:06:41,412 --> 00:06:43,350
Puu, no!

66
00:06:44,017 --> 00:06:44,986
Stop!

67
00:06:47,557 --> 00:06:49,494
Small Lady?

68
00:06:50,663 --> 00:06:52,667
Sailor Moon?

69
00:06:54,003 --> 00:06:59,379
And, ah... You're
Sailor Pluto?

70
00:07:00,114 --> 00:07:01,616
Everyone!

71
00:07:04,455 --> 00:07:05,758
Is this your doing?

72
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:11,368
I'm sorry I broke my
promise and brought all
these people with me to
the Door!

73
00:07:11,835 --> 00:07:14,741
But they're my friends
and they're here to help.

74
00:07:14,741 --> 00:07:17,046
We're all going
to rescue Mommy!

75
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,617
Don't say anymore...

76
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:20,585
[gasp]

77
00:07:23,524 --> 00:07:26,363
Puu, does this mean
you're not angry?

78
00:07:26,763 --> 00:07:31,038
No, I'm very proud of
you. You've finally
mastered the space-
time key.

79
00:07:31,138 --> 00:07:34,511
You've become an
exceptionally fine
young lady.

80
00:07:34,611 --> 00:07:35,747
Puu...

81
00:07:40,789 --> 00:07:45,765
Forgive my behavior. You
were kind enough to
accompany Small Lady
here. I should not have

82
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:48,604
threatened you. Please
accept my apology.

83
00:07:49,706 --> 00:07:50,640
Huh?

84
00:07:52,411 --> 00:07:56,118
But I must tell you my
life never seems to be
easy when I'm dealing
with you, Sailor Moon.

85
00:07:56,518 --> 00:07:58,489
Uh... Hm?

86
00:07:59,557 --> 00:08:03,665
I will open this Door
to allow you all to go
beyond the boundaries
of time.

87
00:08:24,069 --> 00:08:29,413
The Door of Space and
time is now open. You
may set forth on your
journey to the future.

88
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,916
Thank you, Puu.

89
00:08:31,082 --> 00:08:33,720
All right. Hold
each others' hands.

90
00:08:34,756 --> 00:08:40,700
Sailor Moon, you must
never let go of Small
Lady's hand. If you
are separated at any

91
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:45,543
point, you may become
trapped between the
gaps of time, forever.

92
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:50,986
Sailor Pluto, please
come with us!

93
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:56,630
I cannot leave. This is
my permanent station. And
since I cannot go with

94
00:08:56,663 --> 00:08:59,101
you, please protect
Small Lady for me.

95
00:08:59,736 --> 00:09:01,572
We'll do our best.

96
00:09:02,174 --> 00:09:04,445
Puu, see you soon!

97
00:09:10,456 --> 00:09:16,233
Now I remember, Queen
Serenity once told me
about a Sailor Guardian
who'd been assigned to

98
00:09:16,467 --> 00:09:22,545
protect the Door of Space
and Time for all eternity.
A solitary Guardian whose
name and very existence

99
00:09:22,578 --> 00:09:27,955
shall never be known to
anyone but the Queen.
She was talking about
Sailor Pluto...

100
00:09:28,255 --> 00:09:30,192
A solitary Guardian...

101
00:09:30,226 --> 00:09:32,697
That no one would
ever know about...

102
00:09:34,233 --> 00:09:37,039
No wonder there's
such a sad look
in her eyes.

103
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:45,020
We've come to the
space-time corridor.
Everyone be careful!

104
00:09:46,623 --> 00:09:48,092
[gasps]

105
00:09:49,127 --> 00:09:51,632
So this is the space-
time corridor?!

106
00:09:52,534 --> 00:09:56,140
It must be, but this
blast of pressure is
really intense!

107
00:09:56,207 --> 00:09:57,777
Let's try to
move forward.

108
00:10:07,261 --> 00:10:11,002
I'm seeing movement in
the ancient space-time
corridor, and it appears

109
00:10:11,035 --> 00:10:13,640
to be traveling by time-
warp to Crystal Tokyo.

110
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,577
That must be
the Rabbit.

111
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:20,019
There's more than just
one. This energy reading
suggests several.

112
00:10:20,052 --> 00:10:20,686
Hm?

113
00:10:21,821 --> 00:10:25,596
Hmph! It's unusual for
that planet to have
any visitors.

114
00:10:28,668 --> 00:10:30,738
The time has come...

115
00:10:33,209 --> 00:10:38,152
We must now seize the
Legendary Silver Crystal
and the Rabbit, and then

116
00:10:38,185 --> 00:10:40,791
topple that impenetrable
castle.

117
00:10:42,293 --> 00:10:46,668
Seize the Rabbit?
Why do we need her
now?

118
00:10:47,737 --> 00:10:52,579
Bringing the Malefic
Black Crystal and the
Rabbit together will

119
00:10:52,612 --> 00:10:55,250
result in an
extraordinary power.

120
00:10:57,121 --> 00:10:58,657
Those eyes...

121
00:11:00,293 --> 00:11:07,039
Ah... She must be
Sailor Moon. So
beautiful.

122
00:11:07,139 --> 00:11:08,676
Brother, what's wrong?

123
00:11:09,677 --> 00:11:12,249
You must get hold
of the Rabbit!

124
00:11:13,217 --> 00:11:16,156
Esmeraude, capture
the Rabbit.

125
00:11:16,223 --> 00:11:20,029
Bring her and Sailor
Moon here alive.
Understand?

126
00:11:20,196 --> 00:11:22,100
You want Sailor
Moon, too?

127
00:11:22,668 --> 00:11:26,040
I want to gaze into
those beautiful eyes
of hers.

128
00:11:26,675 --> 00:11:28,078
But brother...

129
00:11:29,046 --> 00:11:30,582
Do not fail me!

130
00:11:32,253 --> 00:11:37,763
Wiseman! That feeble old
prophet always shows up
here, trying to get my
brother to do his bidding.

131
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:43,106
Toying with his mind,
making demands, but never
revealing what his true
intentions are.

132
00:11:43,674 --> 00:11:48,783
Come to think of it, he
was the one who put those
strange ideas about the
Legendary Silver Crystal

133
00:11:48,817 --> 00:11:50,352
into Prince
Demande's head.

134
00:11:52,723 --> 00:11:55,196
One day, I'll
expose that fraud.

135
00:11:56,096 --> 00:11:59,670
Personally, I think it's
more important to make
Prince Demande forget

136
00:11:59,703 --> 00:12:02,809
about that dewy-eyed
temptress, Sailor Moon.

137
00:12:02,876 --> 00:12:04,680
[evil chuckling]

138
00:12:09,622 --> 00:12:13,028
Sailor Moon R!

139
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:28,357
Sailor Moon R!

140
00:12:34,134 --> 00:12:36,639
This force feels like
it's gonna crush us!

141
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:37,741
Not sure I'll
make it!

142
00:12:37,774 --> 00:12:39,377
You will! Just
hang in there!

143
00:12:39,411 --> 00:12:41,047
I'm trying!

144
00:12:42,316 --> 00:12:46,791
Wow. If she's having
trouble bearing this I
wonder if she's going to

145
00:12:46,824 --> 00:12:49,029
be strong enough
to rescue Mommy.

146
00:12:49,296 --> 00:12:54,171
I know I mustn't be so
negative, but can she
really save her?

147
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:58,680
Chibi-Usa!
Hold on!

148
00:12:58,813 --> 00:13:00,182
We'll make it!

149
00:13:01,786 --> 00:13:03,055
Trust me!

150
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:08,230
Yeah, I've got to
trust her. Sailor
Moon has never let
me down.

151
00:13:09,834 --> 00:13:13,341
[crazy laughter]

152
00:13:13,407 --> 00:13:16,279
How nice of you to
step into our domain!

153
00:13:16,312 --> 00:13:17,715
Esmeraude!

154
00:13:17,816 --> 00:13:20,354
Allow me to give you
a proper welcome!

155
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:22,023
[screaming]

156
00:13:22,056 --> 00:13:23,092
[laughing]

157
00:13:24,427 --> 00:13:28,969
[screaming]

158
00:13:30,806 --> 00:13:33,945
Ugh! I've lost them
in the space-time
labyrinth!

159
00:13:34,213 --> 00:13:35,782
Luax!

160
00:13:37,018 --> 00:13:38,220
At your service...

161
00:13:38,253 --> 00:13:42,093
Your power let's you
move easily about the
space-time labyrinth.

162
00:13:42,093 --> 00:13:44,999
So go find the
intruders and
get rid of them.

163
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:45,801
Yes.

164
00:13:45,834 --> 00:13:47,137
Except one!

165
00:13:47,704 --> 00:13:50,710
It's the small one.
You mustn't harm
the Rabbit.

166
00:13:51,144 --> 00:13:53,114
Don't kill the Rabbit.

167
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:56,019
Understood!

168
00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:02,131
Oh dear, I must have
forgotten to mention
not to kill Sailor Moon.

169
00:14:02,165 --> 00:14:07,074
Or perhaps Luax left
before hearing all my
instructions. Oh,
that's too bad.

170
00:14:07,107 --> 00:14:10,980
[laughing]

171
00:14:12,049 --> 00:14:14,020
Agh! Is everyone okay?

172
00:14:14,387 --> 00:14:17,259
Chibi-Usa and Tuxedo
Mask aren't here with
us!

173
00:14:17,326 --> 00:14:18,728
Apparently...

174
00:14:18,728 --> 00:14:21,767
We've been sucked into a
dark gap in the movement
of space-time.

175
00:14:22,168 --> 00:14:24,840
How are we ever gonna
reunite with Chibi-Usa?

176
00:14:24,906 --> 00:14:29,983
If we're lost in time, we
could be wandering around
here for an eternity, and
we wouldn't even know it!

177
00:14:30,016 --> 00:14:33,122
I'm sorry. If only I
hadn't let go of Chibi-
Usa's hand!

178
00:14:33,155 --> 00:14:39,066
It's not going to accomplish
anything to blame yourself
like this. We need to focus
on finding Chibi-Usa.

179
00:14:39,099 --> 00:14:40,401
How do we do that?

180
00:14:40,401 --> 00:14:43,141
By brainstorming to
come up with a way.

181
00:14:51,422 --> 00:14:54,762
What's going on? The
Silver Crystal's
glowing...

182
00:14:55,296 --> 00:14:56,833
Look! Up there...

183
00:14:56,866 --> 00:15:00,105
How strange! It's
glowing, too!

184
00:15:00,138 --> 00:15:03,111
It's as though it's
signaling the Silver
Crystal.

185
00:15:03,344 --> 00:15:07,753
Yes, perhaps the Silver
Crystal of the future is
resonating with Sailor

186
00:15:07,753 --> 00:15:09,790
Moon's Silver Crystal
of the present.

187
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:11,760
I think we should
go check it out.

188
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,031
I agree. There's no
use staying here.

189
00:15:14,064 --> 00:15:15,033
Let's go!

190
00:15:15,033 --> 00:15:16,001
Right!

191
00:15:19,274 --> 00:15:20,310
Where are we?

192
00:15:20,777 --> 00:15:23,048
This place is
kinda creepy!

193
00:15:23,215 --> 00:15:26,187
Worse than that, we
got separated from
everyone else.

194
00:15:26,221 --> 00:15:29,159
Yeah, I know. So now
what's gonna happen
to us?

195
00:15:29,226 --> 00:15:32,232
We have to find the
others. C'mon. Let's
go.

196
00:15:32,332 --> 00:15:33,167
Wait!

197
00:15:33,534 --> 00:15:34,803
Who's there?

198
00:15:36,406 --> 00:15:39,779
You must not go that
way. Turn around. Go
the way you're facing
now. Quickly.

199
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:41,182
What do you think?

200
00:15:41,249 --> 00:15:42,784
Could be a trap.

201
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,793
We'll do as he says. I
can't explain it but I
have a feeling we should
trust that man.

202
00:15:51,501 --> 00:15:53,204
[nervous gasps]

203
00:15:53,237 --> 00:15:55,041
Where is everyone?

204
00:15:55,275 --> 00:15:56,577
Nobody's here.

205
00:15:57,312 --> 00:16:00,250
I've ended up all
by myself again.

206
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:01,987
Mommy...

207
00:16:08,198 --> 00:16:10,269
The door to the
future...

208
00:16:11,338 --> 00:16:13,976
Beyond that is
the future...

209
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:16,213
I've come home...

210
00:16:17,482 --> 00:16:21,222
But I'll never be able
to rescue Mommy all by
myself.

211
00:16:22,058 --> 00:16:23,260
Mommy...

212
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,096
Poor little thing...

213
00:16:26,098 --> 00:16:31,041
Oh, you poor little
thing. My little
darling...

214
00:16:35,549 --> 00:16:37,553
It's all right now.

215
00:16:37,586 --> 00:16:39,990
Ah! Mommy!

216
00:16:42,028 --> 00:16:44,099
Let's go home together.

217
00:16:45,034 --> 00:16:46,303
Mommy!

218
00:16:59,627 --> 00:17:01,464
Wait, you're
not my mommy!

219
00:17:03,167 --> 00:17:04,169
Who are you?!

220
00:17:04,202 --> 00:17:07,442
You don't recognize
me? I'm your mommy,
Rabbit.

221
00:17:07,475 --> 00:17:11,315
No, you're not! You're
just pretending. My
mommy never called me
Rabbit!

222
00:17:11,349 --> 00:17:12,484
Ohh...

223
00:17:12,518 --> 00:17:14,121
[evil laughter]

224
00:17:14,155 --> 00:17:18,028
Guess no one can
fool you, little
Rabbit.

225
00:17:18,262 --> 00:17:19,063
[gasp]

226
00:17:20,399 --> 00:17:23,405
However, this would have
been a lot easier on you
if you had believed me.

227
00:17:24,607 --> 00:17:27,145
Are you Mommy's
little crybaby?

228
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:28,981
[gasp]

229
00:17:32,154 --> 00:17:36,296
It's all over. I'm
sorry, Mommy! I can't
save you!

230
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:41,572
Chibi-Usa! You're going
to rescue your mommy.
That's all you ever talk

231
00:17:41,572 --> 00:17:44,109
about. So don't get
cold feet now.

232
00:17:44,344 --> 00:17:45,412
He's right!

233
00:17:47,115 --> 00:17:49,320
I'm not going to
give up yet!

234
00:17:50,054 --> 00:17:51,290
Luna P!

235
00:17:51,357 --> 00:17:52,325
Agh!

236
00:17:52,358 --> 00:17:56,333
Luna P! Transform!

237
00:18:02,477 --> 00:18:04,548
[grunting]

238
00:18:07,152 --> 00:18:08,255
Take that!

239
00:18:08,455 --> 00:18:10,225
[laughing]

240
00:18:10,259 --> 00:18:16,036
Mmm, that's not very nice
of you, trying to hurt me
with a slingshot full of
energy balls.

241
00:18:16,103 --> 00:18:19,208
You're a naughty child.
You should be punished.

242
00:18:19,309 --> 00:18:20,411
Severely!

243
00:18:20,444 --> 00:18:22,314
[roaring]

244
00:18:22,347 --> 00:18:23,316
[screaming]

245
00:18:23,349 --> 00:18:24,485
Back off!

246
00:18:26,054 --> 00:18:28,458
We're warning you! Don't
even think about laying a
finger on that child!

247
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:31,464
Well! How were you
able to get through
that labyrinth?

248
00:18:31,464 --> 00:18:35,973
Not that it's any of
your business, lady, but
we have a strong guide
called "luck"!

249
00:18:36,006 --> 00:18:37,475
I am the Pretty
Guardian...

250
00:18:37,475 --> 00:18:40,181
...who fights for
love and for justice!

251
00:18:44,622 --> 00:18:46,559
I am Sailor Moon!

252
00:18:47,461 --> 00:18:51,435
And now in the name
of the Moon, I'll
punish you!

253
00:18:51,602 --> 00:18:56,210
Doubt it. I'll give you
a taste of my punishment
now and deal with the
Rabbit later.

254
00:18:56,243 --> 00:18:57,379
Ready or not...

255
00:18:57,546 --> 00:19:00,552
Take this!

256
00:19:08,367 --> 00:19:10,036
[screaming]

257
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:11,973
[screaming]

258
00:19:12,107 --> 00:19:14,277
Wait! What just
happened here?

259
00:19:14,311 --> 00:19:15,246
[laughing]

260
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:18,351
I radically changed
the polarity of time!

261
00:19:18,385 --> 00:19:20,055
Is that even
possible?

262
00:19:20,088 --> 00:19:22,092
That's not gonna
stop me! Burning...

263
00:19:22,126 --> 00:19:23,127
No, don't!

264
00:19:25,064 --> 00:19:27,502
...Mandala!

265
00:19:29,053 --> 00:19:29,706
[gasp]

266
00:19:29,739 --> 00:19:31,242
Huh? What's happening?

267
00:19:32,044 --> 00:19:34,381
The reversed polarity
made it go backwards!

268
00:19:34,415 --> 00:19:36,152
[chuckling]

269
00:19:36,185 --> 00:19:37,354
You ready, Venus?

270
00:19:37,387 --> 00:19:38,121
Yeah!

271
00:19:38,155 --> 00:19:39,558
Try dodging this!

272
00:19:39,591 --> 00:19:43,532
Sparkling Wide
Pressure!

273
00:19:43,565 --> 00:19:46,203
Venus Love
Me Chain!

274
00:19:49,142 --> 00:19:50,278
Sorry...

275
00:19:50,378 --> 00:19:51,380
[screaming]

276
00:19:58,159 --> 00:20:01,531
According to my
calculations, the
time distortion
vanishes for a

277
00:20:01,565 --> 00:20:05,206
moment when she initiates
her power. That's our
chance!

278
00:20:05,406 --> 00:20:06,575
We're only gonna
have a moment?

279
00:20:06,608 --> 00:20:10,548
It's all or nothing.
Our only hope is the
Sailor Planet Attack.

280
00:20:10,548 --> 00:20:12,119
Right! Let's do it!

281
00:20:13,387 --> 00:20:15,157
Hold on. How are we
going to get her to
activate her power?

282
00:20:15,157 --> 00:20:17,328
Leave that to
me! I'll do it!

283
00:20:17,361 --> 00:20:18,096
Chibi-Usa!

284
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:19,298
No, it's too
dangerous!

285
00:20:19,298 --> 00:20:20,032
[sigh]

286
00:20:20,032 --> 00:20:20,467
Ahh!

287
00:20:21,135 --> 00:20:21,736
[giggling]

288
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:23,472
What are you up to
now, little girl?

289
00:20:23,506 --> 00:20:31,087
Mamo, I'm going to
believe in me. And I
promise to believe more
in everyone else, too!

290
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:35,127
You little fool! You
think because you're
cute, I'll go easy
on you?

291
00:20:36,429 --> 00:20:39,169
I'll give you all
I've got, cutie-pie.

292
00:20:40,437 --> 00:20:42,174
[yelling]

293
00:20:45,079 --> 00:20:47,050
Now's your chance,
everyone!

294
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:49,053
Mars Star Power!

295
00:20:49,086 --> 00:20:51,090
Mercury Star Power!

296
00:20:51,124 --> 00:20:53,395
Jupiter Star Power!

297
00:20:53,428 --> 00:20:55,499
Venus Star Power!

298
00:20:55,532 --> 00:20:59,072
Moon Crystal Power!

299
00:20:59,206 --> 00:21:00,274
[growling]

300
00:21:02,245 --> 00:21:08,122
[grunting]

301
00:21:08,156 --> 00:21:08,801
Agh!

302
00:21:10,694 --> 00:21:12,263
Curse you!

303
00:21:12,597 --> 00:21:15,369
Luax Power!

304
00:21:16,404 --> 00:21:17,172
[gasp]

305
00:21:19,309 --> 00:21:21,280
You're here for
me just as you
promised!

306
00:21:21,313 --> 00:21:22,449
Attack now!

307
00:21:22,515 --> 00:21:25,354
Sailor Planet Attack!

308
00:21:33,369 --> 00:21:34,304
What?!

309
00:21:38,412 --> 00:21:44,089
[screaming]

310
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:49,399
Alright!

311
00:21:50,501 --> 00:21:52,371
I'm proud of you,
Chibi-Usa!

312
00:21:52,438 --> 00:21:53,440
Thanks!

313
00:21:53,473 --> 00:21:55,476
Same goes for you
all. Good work.

314
00:21:55,510 --> 00:22:02,523

315
00:22:02,556 --> 00:22:06,531
Now that we're all
together again, let's
continue on to Crystal
Tokyo.

316
00:22:12,442 --> 00:22:13,410
[gasps]

317
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:15,280
No way!

318
00:22:22,561 --> 00:22:26,267
This is...
...the future?

319
00:24:11,629 --> 00:24:17,373
The time has come to tell
you everything about us
and about your future.

320
00:24:17,407 --> 00:24:18,642
I know that voice...

321
00:24:18,642 --> 00:24:21,381
That's the voice from
our dreams! Who are you!

322
00:24:21,415 --> 00:24:25,288
At this moment in time,
your feelings for one
another are being tested.

323
00:24:25,322 --> 00:24:27,392
Show me the strength
of your love.

324
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:32,903
Next time on Sailor Moon R:
"The Shocking Future:
Demande's Dark Ambition."

325
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:35,873
The moonlight is a
messenger of love.
