Every one of us has a
beautiful everlasting song
inside our hearts that keeps
our spirits up through the

00:02:05,368 --> 00:02:10,668
hardest and saddest of times.
How dare you trample on the
heart of someone with such a
lovely song!

00:02:10,701 --> 00:02:12,634
I am Sailor Moon!

The amulets from the Hikawa
Shrine work wonders on
lovesickness!

00:02:32,401 --> 00:02:35,901
And I'm telling you this,
based on my own personal
experience.

8
00:02:35,934 --> 00:02:40,801
No matter how many times
I've had my heart broken,
I've always found a new
love with this.

9
00:02:40,834 --> 00:02:44,001
Our amulets are the best
cure for problems of the
heart.

10
00:02:44,034 --> 00:02:45,434
I could sure use one!

Here you go! Come back if
things don't work out
for you.

14
00:02:50,368 --> 00:02:52,668
Weren't you listening?
These amulets fix
everything.

15
00:02:52,701 --> 00:02:54,334
Oh! That's right.

16
00:02:54,901 --> 00:02:58,534
Ah! Being a Shrine
Maiden sure is tiring.

17

Thank you for all your
hard work, girls!

Hey, where's Rei?

22
00:03:08,334 --> 00:03:12,001
Rei is chairman of the
school festival, so she'll
be coming home late for a
few days. But would you like

23
00:03:12,034 --> 00:03:14,434
to be Shrine Maidens
too, and help out?

25

Well, that would be
pretty cool, except for
I don't want to memorize
sutras.

26

This is a Shinto Shrine.
Only Buddhists do sutras.

there. Okay!

Um, I have a question
about our class exhibition.

32
00:03:48,368 --> 00:03:52,901
I told you everything you
need to know about it
yesterday! How many times
must I go over it?!

33
00:03:52,934 --> 00:03:56,601
I don't have time right
now. I'm busy trying to
get the stage ready!

34
00:03:56,968 --> 00:04:01,234

and we're afraid to proceed
until we get your permission.

Oh, all right.
I'll come by later.

36

Who left this equipment
here? Somebody could bump
into it, so put it away!

37
00:04:08,334 --> 00:04:09,901
Miss Rei is so
efficient.

38
00:04:09,934 --> 00:04:11,334
She is!

39
00:04:13,234 --> 00:04:15,934
We wouldn't be able to
have a successful festival
this year without her
putting everything together.

40
00:04:15,968 --> 00:04:19,434
You two, stop standing
around gabbing, and get
working!

41
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:20,834
Okay!

42
00:04:20,868 --> 00:04:23,301
Miss Rei actually spoke
to us for the first time!

43
00:04:23,334 --> 00:04:24,701
Lucky us!

44

Ha! Ha! We came
here to support you!

Here. Mako made some
lunch for you.

Thank you!

You don't mind if we
stay and watch rehearsal

This isn't a cabaret!
Don't use those colors!

Cabaret?

We don't know what that
is, so we don't know what
colors not to use!

Nobody really seems
to care but me.

Nice song! It sounded
really good, and I was
wondering who wrote the
lyrics?

65
00:05:26,501 --> 00:05:31,801
Well, you have good taste
in music. As it just so
happens, I wrote every
single musical number for

66
00:05:31,834 --> 00:05:33,434
the School Festival.

67
00:05:33,468 --> 00:05:34,501
Huh?!

68
00:05:35,934 --> 00:05:39,834
What is it? You have a
problem with the fact
that I wrote all the
songs?

[laughing]

70
00:05:40,701 --> 00:05:42,368
No problem at all!

71
00:05:44,234 --> 00:05:46,234
Although, it does sound
like you're using the
School Festival to show
off your personal talent.

72
00:05:46,268 --> 00:05:52,701
I sure am! Why do you think
I became Festival chairman
and on-site manager? I have
a lot invested in this!

Thank goodness,
you're the same
Rei!

00:06:01,668 --> 00:06:03,801
A school festival...

77
00:06:03,834 --> 00:06:07,668
That means tomorrow, this
place will be brimming
with youthful energy.

78
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:10,201
I can almost taste
it already.

Yes, then the Makai Tree
will be able to thrive
once again.

Yes...

Hey, Rei! Tomorrow's
the big day!

We're gonna take the day
off from our Shrine Maiden
jobs to come and watch the
show!

Oh? Did Grandpa say
he's coming too?

Yeah. Yuichiro's said
he's going to cover
for us.

85
00:06:29,501 --> 00:06:32,734
It's pretty amazing that
you wrote all the songs
by yourself.

86
00:06:32,768 --> 00:06:35,268
I'll say. That must've
been a lot of work.

No, not really.

88
00:06:38,101 --> 00:06:40,468
The lyrics came to
me rather easily.

89
00:06:44,201 --> 00:06:48,268
And the melodies just
seemed to flow right
off of my finger tips.

00:06:50,101 --> 00:06:52,168
I never even
broke a sweat.

91
00:07:01,368 --> 00:07:05,168
It was easy. A piece
of cake. It's what
they call talent.

Rei! You're so
awesome!

for the Guardians to get so
excited about these things?

right once in a
while.

both so cute! Would you be
interested in a part-time
job at my shrine?

98

I'm so sorry, sir, but
this school doesn't allow
us to take part-time jobs.

You have a nice
one, too!

off.

You know what?

Huh?

I never realized, but
you're a really super
hard worker.

[giggling]

320
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:20,736
Usagi, why don't I teach
you a thing or two about
hard work?

321
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:23,136
What?! No thanks, I don't
need to be like you!

325
00:22:28,936 --> 00:22:31,736
Of course I'm sure!
I wouldn't say it if
I wasn't sure!

You're hogging

Hey Usagi! Mako seems to
be really interested in
Seijuro.

328
00:24:15,939 --> 00:24:17,073
<i>What?!</i>

329
00:24:17,106 --> 00:24:18,706
Yeah, and she said she
was even gonna make lunch
for him!

00:24:22,639 --> 00:24:24,939
Uhh...

332
00:24:24,973 --> 00:24:27,706
<i>I mean that's like, well</i>
<i>I don't know what it's</i>

333
00:24:27,739 --> 00:24:29,539
Good grief...
