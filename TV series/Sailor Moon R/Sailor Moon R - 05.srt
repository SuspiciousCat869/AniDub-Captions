00:01:57,221 --> 00:02:01,421
Cherry blossom season's
such a happy time of year
for everyone! So how dare
you show up and try to

2
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:08,088
wreck it! What?! My tiara's
still not working? Aghh!
Now I can't even transform
and fight! Well, I guess

3
00:02:08,121 --> 00:02:12,421
that's it. Bye guys! Right,
like it's gonna be that
easy! Anyway...

4
00:02:12,454 --> 00:02:15,921
In the name of the
Moon, I'll punish you!

5
00:02:22,688 --> 00:02:24,188
Blossoms?

6
00:02:24,221 --> 00:02:29,621
Viewing cherry blossoms is
an annual seasonal event
for people from this planet.

7
00:02:29,654 --> 00:02:36,221
It seems to go on all day
and night for them. And I
understand humans use a
lot of energy doing it.

8
00:02:36,254 --> 00:02:43,221
I have heard stories that
when our tribe was prosperous,
the Makai Tree had beautiful
flower blossoms on it as well.

9
00:03:01,554 --> 00:03:03,354
Blossoms?

10
00:03:03,388 --> 00:03:05,054
[chuckle]

11
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:09,154
I think we can gather a lot
of human energy while they're
viewing these cherry blossoms.

12
00:03:14,521 --> 00:03:18,154

[chattering]

14
00:03:30,354 --> 00:03:34,154
Make way! Make way!
Usagi's coming through!

15
00:03:34,188 --> 00:03:37,921
Hey, you know I really
appreciate you being our
chaperone for today,

16
00:03:37,954 --> 00:03:39,688
even though we're not
your students.

17
00:03:39,721 --> 00:03:44,854
You're always so busy, I
almost feel bad for taking
you away from school to be
here with us..

18
00:03:44,888 --> 00:03:46,388
I was happy to do it!

19
00:03:46,421 --> 00:03:49,288
I think we should all
just forget about school
for today!

20
00:03:49,321 --> 00:03:50,788
For sure!

21
00:03:50,821 --> 00:03:54,154
Right now we're just a
happy bunch of people
enjoying the cherry
blossoms!

22
00:03:58,221 --> 00:04:02,254
Naru? Naru? Naru!
Naru? Naru?

23
00:04:02,288 --> 00:04:04,821
Ah! Hey, everyone!
Over here!

24
00:04:04,854 --> 00:04:06,854
Huh? Wow! Look,
it's Umino!

25
00:04:07,854 --> 00:04:10,354
Thanks for saving
us this spot, Umino!

26
00:04:10,388 --> 00:04:12,821
I'm surprised you
were able to find
one.

27
00:04:12,854 --> 00:04:14,288
Have you been
here long?

28
00:04:15,154 --> 00:04:17,088
Since 8 o'clock
last night.

29
00:04:17,121 --> 00:04:18,754
What?!

30
00:04:18,954 --> 00:04:22,954
But isn't it still cold
outside at night this
time of year?

31
00:04:22,988 --> 00:04:24,888
I was just fine!

32
00:04:24,921 --> 00:04:27,388
I brought my own
secret weapon with me!

33
00:04:27,421 --> 00:04:31,021
My trusty sleeping bag
kept me toasty all night!

34
00:04:31,054 --> 00:04:34,821
That was smart, but you
really didn't have to
go that far you know.

35
00:04:34,854 --> 00:04:41,088
Well, I'm happy to help
all of you, but I really
consider it my special
duty to do this for Naru!

36
00:04:41,121 --> 00:04:43,254
You did this for me?

37
00:04:43,288 --> 00:04:46,121
Yes! For you, my
dear, Naru!

38
00:04:46,521 --> 00:04:48,021
Umino...

39
00:04:54,221 --> 00:04:57,321
Come on everyone!
It's time for our
picnic!

40
00:04:57,354 --> 00:04:59,188
Yeah, let's eat!

41
00:05:01,254 --> 00:05:07,054
<i>Uh...Naru? Zipping me</i>
<i>up in here was really</i>
<i>uncalled for! I did</i>
<i>this for you!</i>

42
00:05:07,088 --> 00:05:10,254
<i>Naru!!</i>

43
00:05:10,921 --> 00:05:13,054
I know right...

44
00:05:13,088 --> 00:05:17,021
How could you! I was
just trying to make
you happy, Naru.

45
00:05:17,054 --> 00:05:21,054
Sorry! But Umino, you
know I was just kidding
around!

46
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:25,888
[girls chattering]

47
00:05:25,921 --> 00:05:30,821
Oh wow! All your
lunches look so
delicious!

48
00:05:30,854 --> 00:05:33,954
Your lunch looks like
you must've dropped it
on the floor.

49
00:05:36,354 --> 00:05:40,088
Knock it off! I made
my rice balls with real
tender loving care.

50
00:05:40,121 --> 00:05:41,054
Oh really?

51
00:05:41,088 --> 00:05:44,221
Unlike you, I took
my time and made
some food!

52
00:05:44,254 --> 00:05:44,888
[growling]

53
00:05:46,854 --> 00:05:48,921
Hmm...

54
00:05:48,954 --> 00:05:52,288
As usual, your lunch
is looking really
tasty, Mako!

55
00:05:52,321 --> 00:05:55,954
Hah! You think so?
Go on, take whatever
you like.

56
00:05:55,988 --> 00:05:57,054
Really?!

57
00:05:57,488 --> 00:05:59,421
Here's your
lunch, Umino.

58
00:06:00,088 --> 00:06:02,154
All this for me?!

59
00:06:02,188 --> 00:06:04,254
So I guess that
means you like it?

60
00:06:04,921 --> 00:06:07,254
I'm sure it's the
best lunch in the
universe!

61
00:06:07,288 --> 00:06:09,221
Stop exaggerating!

62
00:06:09,721 --> 00:06:11,221
Hmm...

63
00:06:12,621 --> 00:06:16,021
Boy Ami, your lunch
and Minako's sandwiches
look really tasty as well.

64
00:06:16,054 --> 00:06:17,421
Oh, well have some!

65
00:06:17,454 --> 00:06:19,321
Eat as much
as you like!

66
00:06:21,121 --> 00:06:22,221
Mmm!

67
00:06:22,254 --> 00:06:25,254
Hey, Natsumi!
Where's your
lunch?

68
00:06:25,288 --> 00:06:28,188
I feel on energy,
not food.

69
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,221
Huh?

70
00:06:29,254 --> 00:06:30,688
Oh! Nothing!

71
00:06:32,388 --> 00:06:35,654
I gotcha! You were just
planning on eating off
what everyone else
brought, is that it?!

72
00:06:35,688 --> 00:06:37,354
That was your plan!

73
00:06:37,388 --> 00:06:41,921
Oh yeah? Well from what
I can see your eating
some of Mako's lunch too.

74
00:06:41,954 --> 00:06:46,254
Just shut it. Why don't
you stuff your face with
those ugly rice balls
already?

75
00:06:49,254 --> 00:06:52,121
This tastes great! I
want you to have the
other half.

76
00:06:52,154 --> 00:06:55,221
Oh! How generous
and so unlike you!

Why you! You're
just so unbelievable!

That's what you get
for being so mean!

Don't get mad, don't
get mad. I mean after
all we're not in school.

88
00:07:29,954 --> 00:07:33,654
So, you all get a
free period hour
starting now!

89
00:07:33,688 --> 00:07:39,288
Uhh, wait a second.
Ms. Haruna, we're not
in school right now.

I have feelings too you
know! How would you like
it if I did that to you!

97
00:08:01,321 --> 00:08:03,288
How beautiful...

98
00:08:06,288 --> 00:08:08,921
So, you really think
she's beautiful?

99
00:08:08,954 --> 00:08:13,854
No, you're misunderstanding
me. I wasn't referring to
Usagi at all, An.

100
00:08:13,888 --> 00:08:15,921
I don't believe you.

101
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:19,788
I was simply commenting
on the beauty of these
cherry blossoms!

Well, that
doesn't matter.

00:08:23,721 --> 00:08:25,554
That all can wait.

105
00:08:27,121 --> 00:08:30,188
Right now, let's focus
on extracting some fresh
energy from these young
humans.

106
00:08:30,221 --> 00:08:33,921
Yes, I was actually
thinking the exact
same thing.

107
00:08:36,788 --> 00:08:38,854
Pick one, An...

Cherry blossoms are
pretty, but to me, you
look even more beautiful
than they ever could.

112
00:09:21,521 --> 00:09:25,554
Doesn't it ever embarrass
you to say that kind of
stuff to me?

113
00:09:25,588 --> 00:09:29,221
No, I am only saying
what's really in my
heart.

114
00:09:29,854 --> 00:09:33,488
Yeah, sure. You
know, honestly...

00:09:33,721 --> 00:09:34,521
Huh?!

116

Wake up you two!

you go get someone!

Hmm...

I think once they get
some rest, they should
be fine.

132
00:10:44,454 --> 00:10:48,021
It's strange. I can't
figure out what's
going on here.

their friends had
suddenly passed out.

That many?!

00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:59,621
Yeah, and it's way too
early in the year for
a heat stroke.

So, you think they're
energy's being stolen!

138
00:11:04,954 --> 00:11:08,988
Mm-hmm! Based on how
weak they are, I'm sure
that's what this is.

139
00:11:09,021 --> 00:11:12,754
The others are checking
out where it happened.
We'd better go meet up
with them!

140
00:11:12,788 --> 00:11:13,954
Right!

141
00:11:15,954 --> 00:11:19,788
So, this is where Ms.
Haruna and the others
collapsed, right?

142
00:11:19,821 --> 00:11:22,654
There doesn't seem to
be anything unusual
here...

143
00:11:22,688 --> 00:11:24,954
Still, we should
stay on guard!

144
00:11:27,888 --> 00:11:31,854
I sense it. I sense
an evil aura...

to protect those around
you, I know it will allow
