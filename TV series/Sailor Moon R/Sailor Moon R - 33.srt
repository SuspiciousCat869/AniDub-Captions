1
00:01:57,284 --> 00:02:02,522
Yikes! I can't believe there are
people in this world so
heartless that they would
abandon their pets like this!

2
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:04,958
At least these pets found
someone nice to adopt them.

3
00:02:06,827 --> 00:02:08,862
What's this?! The Black Moon
Clan is using these dogs and
cats for their evil schemes?!

4
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:10,130
That's just not right!

5
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:12,866
Listen up you creeps, I am
Sailor Moon!

6
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:16,269
And in the name of animal
lovers, I'll punish you!

7
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:26,213
You thieving cat!
Take that!

8
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,951
Hey! Dammit! Ya big
mooch, come back here!

9
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:34,821
If I get a hold of you,
the fur's gonna fly!

10
00:02:34,955 --> 00:02:38,825
[Heavy Breathing] Damn! Where'd
he go? That darn fur-ball!

11
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,295
[Heavy Breathing] I thought he
was gonna kill me!

12
00:02:42,863 --> 00:02:45,298
You push things
too far, Artemis.

13
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:50,203
C'mon Luna, cut me some slack! I
was trying to find the enemy's
hideout!

14
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:53,840
Then why is it that you're only
searching at restaurants?

15
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:57,210
You sure you're not just trying
to find a way to get some free
food?

[Guilty Exhale]

00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:04,184
You're gonna have to do better
than that, or people will say
you're nothing but a furry
freeloader.

18
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:05,886
Well!

19
00:03:07,587 --> 00:03:10,524
[Grunts] Not only does Usagi not
do her laundry, she won't even
put her clothes away!

20
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:11,291

00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:13,193

I'm really sorry, Artemis!

25
00:03:29,276 --> 00:03:31,378
Does that bump hurt
when I touch it?

Hey, don't get mad, we were
only having some fun!

32
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:45,425
It's okay.

33
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:49,196
He's just mad cause he hasn't
gotten much done lately.

34
00:03:49,196 --> 00:03:49,863
Huh?

35
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,299
Hey Luna, I heard that!

36
00:03:57,604 --> 00:04:02,242
Uhh, maybe you should have gone
a little easier on him, Luna.

37
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:03,310
You think so?

38
00:04:04,778 --> 00:04:07,414
Don't you worry. I'll be your
mediator and patch things up
between you two.

39
00:04:07,481 --> 00:04:09,316
You can consider it
already done!

Oh I'll consider it done
alright. [Groans]

Artemis, what's wrong?

43
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:26,266
I'm a proud cat, and I refuse to
be insulted!

44
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:29,236
I see! So then you had a fight
with Luna?

45
00:04:29,336 --> 00:04:30,237
[Gasp]

46
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:34,841
You know, there's this old
saying that goes "Fortune favors
the old."

47
00:04:35,075 --> 00:04:38,845
Actually the saying is "Fortune
favors the bold" it's not the
old.

48
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:41,915
Uhh, well some say it that way!

49
00:04:41,982 --> 00:04:45,519
Anyway, it means you can't
expect to accomplish anything
unless you're willing to get out
there...

50
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:47,854
...put yourself on the line, and
take a real risk!

51
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:49,356
Take a risk?

52
00:04:51,091 --> 00:04:54,795
Okay! I'm gonna take some
real action. That'll show Luna
and the rest of them!

53
00:04:54,928 --> 00:04:55,369
Hmph!

54
00:04:56,304 --> 00:04:58,906
Hey what's up? Where're
you running off to?

55
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:02,009
So Luna, you think Artemis is
back at Minako's place?

Don't call me clumsy again!

00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:17,892
Let's all just calm down.
Consider me your mediator. I'll
handle this!

62
00:05:18,025 --> 00:05:19,961
How about mediating
your foot off my head?

He left because of
you, Luna!

Where's he taking those cats?

That's a good
boy, enjoy it.

00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:33,167
I see, he's kidnapping animals!

Go on boy, hop in!

[Giggling]

00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:08,669
Being as beautiful as I am is
such a curse.

Hmm?

You stupid mutt! I am not a fire
hydrant!

Hey! Come back here! When I get
a hold of you, you'll be sorry!

Ami? Wasn't that Artemis
going by in that car?

95
00:07:28,389 --> 00:07:33,094
I wasn't looking, I was
memorizing my one-hundredth
English vocabulary word.

96
00:07:33,194 --> 00:07:36,230
Do you think learning a hundred
a day is too few of them?

97
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:38,366
For you that sounds
about right.

[Animal Noises]

101
00:08:04,225 --> 00:08:07,128
So I think all these animals
could use a checkup.

102

Why sure, all of you are so
lucky you were picked up by
this nice gentleman.

Master Esmeraude, please try to
keep your voice down, Dogbar!

00:09:20,334 --> 00:09:21,635
My bad.

116
00:09:22,036 --> 00:09:25,206
What?! Artemis went to
the Great Animal Kingdom?

117
00:09:25,306 --> 00:09:27,174
Why in the world would
he go there?

118
00:09:27,308 --> 00:09:30,144
So, what kind of place
is that exactly?

119
00:09:30,277 --> 00:09:34,982
It turns out it's a shelter that
houses and takes care of animals
that have been abandoned.

120
00:09:35,149 --> 00:09:39,153
And when people are looking to
get a new pet, they can go visit
there and adopt one.

121
00:09:39,286 --> 00:09:41,989
Well now I'm sure!
He ran away!

122
00:09:42,356 --> 00:09:43,457
[All] Ran away?!

123
00:09:44,859 --> 00:09:47,561
Artemis is always getting teased
by Luna, so he must have finally
had it!

124
00:09:47,661 --> 00:09:51,465
Decided to give up on living
with us and he's run away to the
Great Animal Kingdom!

125
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:53,400
That's totally absurd.

126
00:09:54,168 --> 00:09:57,238
And there's only one of us who
can get Artemis to come back.

Luna! It's up to you!

128
00:10:01,442 --> 00:10:05,112
It's not my job to fetch him.
You're completely overreacting.

129
00:10:05,946 --> 00:10:10,818
I cannot even believe you would
say that. You've gotta help him,
he's your friend!

130
00:10:10,951 --> 00:10:13,120
You were being pretty
rough on him, Luna.

131
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:16,323
Artemis probably left because
you hurt his feelings.

132

You know, the Great Animal
Kingdom doesn't just have cats

Turning into a ghost!

Artemis to come back.

going to the zoo? I wanna go
too!

to visit the Animal Kingdom for
fun.

Hey! No fair! If you don't let
me go I'm gonna tell Mamo!

Artemis!

170
00:12:39,486 --> 00:12:40,788
Luna, why're you here?!

171
00:12:40,888 --> 00:12:42,890
I'll explain later,
get in here!

[Exhales] That was
a close one.

174
00:12:48,696 --> 00:12:50,197
Well, explain yourself.

175
00:12:50,297 --> 00:12:51,532

Huh?

Oh, I was just passing by, saw
you and thought I'de say hi, but
enough about me...

178
00:12:56,804 --> 00:12:59,873
Artemis, what are you doing
running around this place?

179
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:01,508
Whaddya mean?

180
00:13:01,675 --> 00:13:03,510
Did you mess something up again?

181
00:13:03,944 --> 00:13:08,315
[Grunting] No, but I'm very
busy, I'll see ya.

182
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:15,289
Those cats and dogs might've
been influenced by the Black
Moon Clan. This is my chance to
really prove myself.

183
00:13:15,489 --> 00:13:16,390
Hmm?

184
00:13:16,624 --> 00:13:17,891
Quit following me!

185
00:13:19,526 --> 00:13:21,762
What's with the attitude? I came
here cause I'm trying to look
out for a good friend.

I'm going home. Hmph!

00:13:25,032 --> 00:13:27,301
Wait, Luna came here for me?

189
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,276
Why'd I act like that! What's
the matter with me?

190
00:13:37,177 --> 00:13:40,280
I'll be seeing you, Luna. If I
live through this.

I wonder why Luna's taking so
long to find Artemis.

209
00:14:37,404 --> 00:14:40,407
I don't know. Maybe she got lost
in there or something.

210
00:14:40,741 --> 00:14:42,710
Why are they running?

such a great opportunity against
one of our enemies!

You changed the pure hearts of
kind animals into evil!

Huh?

They're so cute!

And so sweet! It's hard to
believe these little guys were
attacking us.

314

[Giggling] You look like my cram
school teacher.

His eyes look a little
like my Grandpa's.

316
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:56,607
This dog looks just like the
grandpa of the guy who
broke my heart...

317

Uhh.

318
00:21:59,076 --> 00:22:02,646
Sorry Artemis, but I have to
say, I still think you're
clumsy.

319
00:22:03,013 --> 00:22:06,884
But I guess you really do
deserve the credit for saving
everyone today.

320
00:22:06,984 --> 00:22:11,055
Because of my keen
investigation, the enemy's
plan never even had a chance.

321
00:22:11,155 --> 00:22:13,824
It seemed more like you
found them by accident.

322
00:22:13,924 --> 00:22:14,825
Hmm.

323
00:22:15,693 --> 00:22:18,062
Hey! Why did all of you
leave me behind?!

324
00:22:18,162 --> 00:22:21,065
I wanted to see the
animals too! Oh!

325
00:22:24,068 --> 00:22:27,037
[Screams]

326
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:29,373
[All] Silly Artemis!

327
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:31,475
Aw come on guys!

328
00:24:10,174 --> 00:24:13,544
Wait what?! You're saying
Ami cheated?!

329
00:24:13,677 --> 00:24:15,479
I've never done such a thing!

330
00:24:17,047 --> 00:24:18,849
Yeah! Ami's not that kind of
person! Why won't you believe
her?!

331
00:24:20,551 --> 00:24:23,954
Everyone thinks I cheated, even
my friends. I don't know who
to trust anymore!

332
00:24:24,021 --> 00:24:25,122
Ami, what's wrong?

333
00:24:25,189 --> 00:24:28,125
No! Get away from me! No!

334
00:24:28,525 --> 00:24:30,494
Next time on Sailor Moon R:

335
00:24:30,627 --> 00:24:33,597
"The Terrifying Illusion: Ami
All Alone"

336
00:24:33,664 --> 00:24:37,000
The moonlight is a messenger
of love.
