1
00:01:57,406 --> 00:02:02,309
Sneezing, runny nose, stuffy
head! The Sailor Guardians are
under the weather!

2
00:02:02,409 --> 00:02:05,810
What? The Black Moon Clan is
behind this flu epidemic?!

3
00:02:05,877 --> 00:02:13,180
They've made people sick with an
unknown virus! If Hideyo Noguchi
found out he'd be furious! In
the name of Sailor Moon...

4
00:02:13,314 --> 00:02:15,982
Sailor V will punish you!

5
00:02:22,686 --> 00:02:27,788
The highly contagious influenza
strain has especially affected
people through the Juban
District.

6
00:02:27,854 --> 00:02:31,023
According to all the medical
experts, there is no cure.

7
00:02:31,123 --> 00:02:34,892
And as a precaution the district
has decided to close all the
local schools.

8
00:02:34,992 --> 00:02:36,959
We'll return after this
commercial break.

[Laughing]

10
00:02:40,528 --> 00:02:44,029
None of these oblivious
fools will ever suspect that
this flu outbreak was caused
by Dark Power.

11
00:02:44,129 --> 00:02:47,699
[Gigging] You simple savages. I
hope you all get sick!

12
00:02:47,799 --> 00:02:50,833
[Evil Laughter]

13
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:55,836
It seems like everyone in town
has come down with the flu.

14
00:02:56,869 --> 00:03:00,172
This is a job for the goddess of
love, Minako Aino!

17
00:03:14,379 --> 00:03:16,347
Hello, Hino residence.

18
00:03:16,413 --> 00:03:19,181
Oh no! Don't tell me
you're sick too, Rei?

19
00:03:19,414 --> 00:03:23,216
I sure am. I've got a really bad
fever. And you, Mako?

20
00:03:23,316 --> 00:03:28,586
Luckily I only have a mild case
of it. But Usagi and Ami sound
like they're in pretty bad
shape.

21
00:03:28,686 --> 00:03:32,588
Aww, sounds like the Sailor
Guardians are all down for the
count, huh?

22
00:03:32,688 --> 00:03:36,523
Nope. One of us is bright eyed
and still in tip top shape.

23
00:03:36,724 --> 00:03:37,657
Huh?

24
00:03:37,724 --> 00:03:39,058
[Grunts]

25
00:03:39,158 --> 00:03:42,193
Yoohoo! Aw, poor Rei. I
heard you caught the flu!

26
00:03:42,326 --> 00:03:43,993
Mi...Minako?

27
00:03:44,094 --> 00:03:46,228
I came to pay you a
get-well visit!

28
00:03:46,328 --> 00:03:49,063
I was hoping I could prevent
another casualty.

29
00:03:49,163 --> 00:03:52,598
Oh, man! Minako sure made a mess
of things here.

30
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,035
Here! Rice porridge! This time
it'll be edible, I'm sure!

31
00:03:59,202 --> 00:04:01,570
Wait, what does that mean?

32
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:06,306
Well, before coming here she
visited Ami and Makoto and made
them rice porridge, too.

33
00:04:06,405 --> 00:04:10,308
Those were practice runs. And
the chipped tooth was really
unfortunate.

34
00:04:10,408 --> 00:04:12,875
But that's in the past now. Okay
eat up!

35
00:04:13,109 --> 00:04:13,743
Here!

36
00:04:14,443 --> 00:04:16,643
Thanks. This is great. [Moans]

the matter?!

[Gasps]

44
00:04:46,192 --> 00:04:48,727
Mina, you added too much salt.

45
00:04:49,061 --> 00:04:53,963
What?! I did it again! Guess I'm
not worth my salt at cooking, am
I?

46
00:04:54,063 --> 00:04:56,598
[Gasps] Your jokes aren't
helping.

47
00:04:56,698 --> 00:05:00,933
Minako, would you please excuse
me? I think I'll rest for a
little while.

48
00:05:01,033 --> 00:05:04,969
Sure thing! In that case, let me
help you get cozy. I'll just
take these things away.

Mina, you klutz!

52
00:05:12,672 --> 00:05:15,174
[Nervous Laugh] So sorry about
that, Rei. I'll get you some
clean sheets, right away. Okay?

53
00:05:15,274 --> 00:05:17,142
[Screams]

54
00:05:17,842 --> 00:05:22,178
Poor, Rei. I get the feeling
she's gonna have a very long
recovery.

55
00:05:22,278 --> 00:05:26,480
[Panting] If she were trying to
cause this much pain, she'd be
more evil than Esmeraude!

56
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,850
Here you go, Rei. I made your
bed, so now you can get a good
rest. Oh, I know!

57
00:05:33,984 --> 00:05:37,919
This always works. I'll put on
some soothing music to help you
drift off to sleep.

58
00:05:38,052 --> 00:05:42,822
This melody uses these things
called alpha waves which make
your brain feel totally relaxed.
It really works.

59
00:05:43,255 --> 00:05:46,490
Hmm, your boom box is different
from mine. Is this the switch?

60
00:05:46,824 --> 00:05:50,225
I don't think it's working? No,
wait, I've got it! It's this
one! Yeah!

[Nervous Laughing]

66
00:06:04,499 --> 00:06:07,067
I should have known better. When
you're sick, maybe it's better
to rest quietly.

67
00:06:07,168 --> 00:06:11,103
I've tried, and I've tried to be
patient. But I have had it!

68
00:06:11,637 --> 00:06:14,204
Get out!

69
00:06:14,304 --> 00:06:15,705
Sorry!

00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:21,475
Aww, I did it again. Okay,
lesson learned.

72
00:06:21,608 --> 00:06:24,444
I have to be extra careful not
to mess things up at Usagi's
place.

73
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:27,611
[Gasp] Hold on a sec, you're
gonna keep helping?!

74
00:06:27,778 --> 00:06:31,613
Of course I am! Everybody in
Usagi's family is sick in bed! I
have no choice!

75
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,482
If I don't go take care of them,
who's going to help them make
it through this crisis?!

76
00:06:36,016 --> 00:06:38,851
Who's gonna help them
make it through dealing with
you?

77
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:39,784
What did you say?!

78
00:06:39,884 --> 00:06:40,819
Meow.

00:06:43,853 --> 00:06:48,622
[Laughing] The Dark Henge is
growing, just as we planned!

80
00:06:49,856 --> 00:06:54,592
We're on our way. It's only a
matter of time before the Dark
Gate is complete.

81
00:06:54,859 --> 00:07:00,662
My beloved Prince Demande, I
hope to be back by your side as
soon as I possibly can.

00:07:00,762 --> 00:07:05,031
[Evil Laughter]

83
00:07:05,897 --> 00:07:08,933
I see, so she went to your
place too, Rei?

84
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:12,568
Ami and Mako called me earlier
after Minako visited them.

85
00:07:12,668 --> 00:07:15,169
They gave me a general idea of
how bad it was.

86
00:07:15,303 --> 00:07:20,538
[Coughing] Minako's a wrecking
ball! You should be careful
Usagi! [Coughing]

87
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:23,974
Well we've got someone over here
who also hasn't caught the flu.

88
00:07:24,074 --> 00:07:25,141
[Screams]

89
00:07:26,675 --> 00:07:28,909
Sorry! Gotta go! Sounds like
little Miss Healthy got into
trouble yet again!

90
00:07:30,177 --> 00:07:31,644
Mommy!

91
00:07:33,345 --> 00:07:36,481
Oh no Chibi-Usa! Chibi-Usa, you
don't have to help me with the
laundry. Please go and play.

92
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:41,816
No, please let me take care of
the house. You're not feeling
well you should go take a nap.

93
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:42,550
You're sweet.

94
00:07:44,384 --> 00:07:46,819
Yeah, yeah. If you want to help
around here, try and keep it to
the stuff you're able to do!

95
00:07:47,152 --> 00:07:49,820
You're so rude! I know how to
take care of laundry!

96
00:07:49,954 --> 00:07:54,456
Oh. is that right? Then who is
the smarty pants who dropped the
sheet that mom just washed?

97
00:07:54,556 --> 00:07:59,125
Usagi, I have a splitting
headache. Please watch Chibi-Usa
for a while, while I rest.

98
00:07:59,192 --> 00:08:00,860
But Mom!

99
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,027
Wait! Can I please do the
cleaning or the cooking?

100
00:08:04,261 --> 00:08:08,463
I really just want to be
helpful! Just let me do
something around here!

101
00:08:08,563 --> 00:08:12,031
You know what I could really
use? Someone to keep Chibi-Usa
company.

102
00:08:12,131 --> 00:08:13,199
Say no more!

103
00:08:13,266 --> 00:08:13,799
Huh?

104
00:08:17,535 --> 00:08:18,869
Let me handle that job!

105
00:08:18,935 --> 00:08:19,969
Hey, Minako.

106
00:08:20,069 --> 00:08:20,703
Huh!

107
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:26,405
Taking care of Chibi-Usa and
nursing you all back to health
is just the kind of assignment
for Minako Aino.

108
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,607
Since I'm the goddess of love!

109
00:08:28,773 --> 00:08:29,941
[Sigh]

110
00:08:30,674 --> 00:08:34,576
That's nice! But I only wanted
your help babysitting Chibi-Usa.

111
00:08:34,676 --> 00:08:38,512
I know, I know. But I can handle
it. Just leave everything to me!
Okay?

112
00:08:38,678 --> 00:08:40,113
Yeah, but...[Coughing]

113
00:08:40,213 --> 00:08:42,747
Oh, that sounds bad! You should
be in bed.

114
00:08:42,847 --> 00:08:46,949
Oh no, I'm fine. I can tell, I'm
almost over this flu bug.

115
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:49,584
Lie down! Don't take your health
for granted!

116
00:08:49,851 --> 00:08:53,753
Remember the old saying:
"Tomorrow is another flu."
Profound, isn't it?

117
00:08:53,853 --> 00:08:54,587
Yeah! Yeah!

118
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:57,321
Come on, let's tuck
you into bed.

119
00:08:57,421 --> 00:08:58,589
[Giggling] Yeah!

120
00:08:59,723 --> 00:09:02,958
Poor Usagi. There's no way this
is going to end well.

121
00:09:03,725 --> 00:09:04,993
[Sigh]

122
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:09,494
Ah, finally some rest.

123
00:09:09,594 --> 00:09:10,829
Are you all
right, Luna?

124
00:09:12,062 --> 00:09:14,130
Of course I'm not all right,
Artemis! You're such a lucky
cat.

125
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:15,064
Huh?

126
00:09:16,098 --> 00:09:17,732
Like the saying goes: "Fools
never catch colds."

127
00:09:17,832 --> 00:09:18,288
Shut up!

128
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:21,257
Is the patient ready?

129
00:09:21,857 --> 00:09:23,924
Hah! Prepare to be well cared
for!

130
00:09:24,025 --> 00:09:25,726
[All] Uhh.

131
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,894
Now tell me, did you
take your temperature?

132
00:09:28,028 --> 00:09:29,094
Uh, no.

133
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:31,429
Great! Chibi-Usa! The
thermometer please!

134
00:09:31,663 --> 00:09:32,663
Right!

135
00:09:32,729 --> 00:09:34,930
Luna-P Transform!

136
00:09:37,265 --> 00:09:38,033
Here you go!

137
00:09:38,932 --> 00:09:40,867
Thank you! Here, alright,
now we wait.

138
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,002
[Beeping]

139
00:09:45,836 --> 00:09:47,003
And time's up!

140
00:09:48,538 --> 00:09:49,038
Uhh?

141
00:09:49,538 --> 00:09:51,005
[Beeping]

142
00:09:52,373 --> 00:09:56,175
That's odd. Chibi-Usa, did you
put fresh batteries in this
thing?

143
00:09:56,275 --> 00:09:57,542
[Crash]
[Gasp]

144
00:09:57,842 --> 00:09:59,610
[Shivering]

145
00:09:59,943 --> 00:10:02,912
[Nervous Laughter] Oh, looks
like I made a tiny mistake.

146
00:10:03,245 --> 00:10:08,581
But hey, that's fine! Taking a
sick person's temperature is
overrated. It's not a big deal
if we skip it.

147
00:10:08,882 --> 00:10:09,882
Uh, Minako?

148
00:10:09,982 --> 00:10:12,517
She's even more clumsy than
Usagi.

149
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:13,684
Tell me about it.

150
00:10:14,818 --> 00:10:17,186
There! Good as new! That takes
care of that! [Giggles]

151
00:10:17,319 --> 00:10:19,720
Hey, I have a terrific
idea. Are you hungry?

152
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:23,656
Because I think a hot bowl of
rice porridge will warm you
right up. What do you say?

153
00:10:23,755 --> 00:10:25,524
No, no, no thanks!
I just ate!

154
00:10:25,657 --> 00:10:27,591
Everyone warned me
not to touch that stuff!

155
00:10:28,158 --> 00:10:29,992
Aw, that's too bad.
[Gasps]

156
00:10:30,693 --> 00:10:32,193
How about some nice music to
relax?

157
00:10:32,326 --> 00:10:34,961
Ahh! Whatever you do, don't
touch that stereo!

158
00:10:35,062 --> 00:10:38,797
What gives? You're not giving me
a chance to do anything helpful
around here!

159
00:10:38,997 --> 00:10:40,731
Yeah! And I'm bored!

160
00:10:42,632 --> 00:10:45,667
Go ask Mom if you can be
helpful! I'm sure there are a
lot of chores around here
you can do!

161
00:10:45,801 --> 00:10:48,035
Oh all right! Let's go
Chibi-Usa!

162
00:10:48,135 --> 00:10:49,636
Okay!

163
00:10:52,804 --> 00:10:54,138
[Sigh]

164
00:10:54,205 --> 00:10:56,506
[Gasps]
[Screams]

165
00:10:57,039 --> 00:10:58,407
Huh!

166
00:10:58,507 --> 00:11:00,709
So cold! So cold!

167
00:11:00,808 --> 00:11:01,775
Meow!

168
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:02,875
Hmm!

169
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:05,711
Ready to help! Are you
with me, Chibi-Usa?

170
00:11:05,777 --> 00:11:06,578
Yeah!

171
00:11:06,945 --> 00:11:08,846
[Screaming]

172
00:11:10,013 --> 00:11:11,780
Why is this happening?!

173
00:11:12,247 --> 00:11:13,915
I can't stop this thing!

174
00:11:14,515 --> 00:11:16,083
Sorry about that!

175
00:11:16,183 --> 00:11:17,883
[Panting]

176
00:11:19,684 --> 00:11:23,853
Please take care of the rest of
this mess. I'll clean up here
after I get more sleep.

177
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:24,787
[Yelling]

178
00:11:25,754 --> 00:11:27,722
Wow, Mom's sure got her work cut
out for her.

179
00:11:29,423 --> 00:11:33,958
Hey that's weird! I wonder
what's making the room spin
around like this. [Moaning]

180
00:11:34,459 --> 00:11:36,093
Oh no! Usagi!

181
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,695
[Sigh] Spinning, spinning, the
room is spinning.

182
00:11:44,163 --> 00:11:47,699
Sailor Moon R!

183
00:12:00,172 --> 00:12:02,773
Sailor Moon R!

184
00:12:05,908 --> 00:12:10,910
I'm so happy to spend Christmas
alone with you, Mamo. I treasure
these intimate moments.

185
00:12:11,578 --> 00:12:12,579
Me too.

186
00:12:12,912 --> 00:12:14,680
[Sigh]

187
00:12:17,048 --> 00:12:18,815
Hold it right there!

188
00:12:19,548 --> 00:12:20,216
Huh?

189
00:12:21,216 --> 00:12:23,151
Usagi, we're still in middle
school, remember?

190
00:12:24,585 --> 00:12:26,486
She's right! You're ten years
too young to go on a date like
this!

191
00:12:26,586 --> 00:12:28,754
No candle lit cake
treats for you!

192
00:12:29,587 --> 00:12:31,489
This needs cleaning!

193
00:12:31,921 --> 00:12:32,555
Mamo!

194
00:12:32,622 --> 00:12:34,456
Usako!

195
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:37,425
Mamo!

196
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:41,660
[Gasps]
Hot! Hot! Hot!

197
00:12:41,893 --> 00:12:43,461
So hot!

198
00:12:43,561 --> 00:12:44,795
[Gasps]

199
00:12:44,962 --> 00:12:46,896
It's so cold!

200
00:12:46,996 --> 00:12:49,030
Huh? Um?

201
00:12:50,931 --> 00:12:52,066
Minako?

202
00:12:52,465 --> 00:12:53,399
You're awake now?

203
00:12:55,467 --> 00:12:58,401
I was hoping you would keep
sleeping while I changed your
towel. I guess I messed that up
too, huh?

204
00:12:58,535 --> 00:13:02,604
Not at all. Wait, does that mean
you were taking care of me for
the whole afternoon?

205
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:05,472
Yeah. There was nothing else I
could do to help here.

206
00:13:05,706 --> 00:13:10,442
Minako, why are you trying so
hard to be helpful I just don't
understand.

207
00:13:10,808 --> 00:13:13,877
Because you're so important to
me and I really care about you.

208
00:13:13,977 --> 00:13:16,478
I have this urge, like I
wanna protect you.

209
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:19,813
But why? Is it because you know
I'm a princess?

210
00:13:20,113 --> 00:13:23,481
Hmm, I guess I just feel
comfortable around you.

211
00:13:24,082 --> 00:13:26,817
You're so full of energy and
you make me feel happy.

212
00:13:27,017 --> 00:13:31,086
That's why. When I know you're
sick, I can't just leave you to
struggle on your own.

213
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,987
So you get well soon, okay?

214
00:13:33,087 --> 00:13:34,087
Mhmm.

215
00:13:34,954 --> 00:13:37,989
[Sighs] Did Usagi's
fever go down yet?

216
00:13:38,089 --> 00:13:42,591
Yup! Can you believe it?
Chibi-Usa's been with me the
whole day helping to take care
of you.

217
00:13:42,758 --> 00:13:43,925
She was?

218
00:13:43,992 --> 00:13:45,959
Maybe I was! So what!

219
00:13:46,093 --> 00:13:50,362
Anyway Minako, we have to go
to the hospital pharmacy to get
medicine for everyone!

220
00:13:50,462 --> 00:13:53,798
Oh right! Usagi, can you
manage on your own?

221
00:13:53,931 --> 00:13:56,632
Mhmm. Thanks to you I
feel a lot better now.

222
00:13:56,732 --> 00:13:59,066
Great to hear! We've
got a job to do!

223
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:01,835
[Giggling] Let's go!

224
00:14:21,812 --> 00:14:23,479
How's it going, Pharmakon?

225
00:14:25,346 --> 00:14:28,782
Master Esmeraude. I'm happy to
report that Dark Henge is
growing quickly. We are
on track.

226
00:14:28,882 --> 00:14:29,549
Hmm.

227
00:14:31,716 --> 00:14:35,485
Meanwhile, we must continue
spreading these Dark
Power-infused medications and
injections among the humans.

228
00:14:35,652 --> 00:14:39,387
Then opening the Dark Gate into
this world will be simple.

229
00:14:39,554 --> 00:14:42,656
[Evil Laughter]

230
00:14:44,623 --> 00:14:45,957
Where is everybody?

231
00:14:46,057 --> 00:14:47,292
I don't know!

232
00:14:48,492 --> 00:14:51,627
'Scuse me! We're here to pick up
prescriptions for Tsukino!

233
00:14:51,793 --> 00:14:53,562
Hello? Ya hear me?

234
00:14:55,396 --> 00:14:57,463
[Grunts] Isn't anyone here?

235
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:01,032
So rude! Hello! Can we get some
help?

236
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:03,834
[Panting]
'Scuse me!

237
00:15:04,034 --> 00:15:04,867
What?!

238
00:15:06,501 --> 00:15:09,536
There's still a child healthy
enough to yell for help?! How is
that even possible?!

239
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:10,837
I, I don't know!

240
00:15:11,838 --> 00:15:14,005
Ah, so you are here!
Hurry it up!

241
00:15:14,505 --> 00:15:17,407
I need my order for Tsukino!
Gimme right now!

242
00:15:17,507 --> 00:15:18,674
Little monster...

243
00:15:20,908 --> 00:15:26,045
All right, all right. But first,
it's time for your vaccination
shot so you don't catch the flu
too, little darling!

244
00:15:26,178 --> 00:15:28,279
What?! A, a shot?

245
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:33,048
It's nothing to worry about,
it'll only take a second. And,
the injections are even free.

246
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:35,049
[Gasps] No!

247
00:15:36,383 --> 00:15:39,484
Such a stubborn girl. You should
accept help from others.
Pharmakon!

248
00:15:39,918 --> 00:15:40,686
Paru!

249
00:15:41,352 --> 00:15:42,653
Hold her down for her shot.

250
00:15:43,653 --> 00:15:46,722
[Screaming]

251
00:15:46,822 --> 00:15:47,488
Paru?!

252
00:15:47,589 --> 00:15:48,423
What's this?

253
00:15:48,523 --> 00:15:49,523
She's the rabbit!

254
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:52,491
[Screaming]

255
00:15:52,592 --> 00:15:53,658
Chibi-Usa!

256
00:15:53,758 --> 00:15:54,526
[All]
Chibi-Usa!

257
00:15:55,193 --> 00:15:56,427
Don't worry, I'm on my way!

258
00:15:57,595 --> 00:16:02,096
Venus Star Power Make Up!

259
00:16:22,107 --> 00:16:27,610
[Laughing] Rabbit! Do you
realize that meeting me here
will mean the end of you?

260
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:29,377
Pharmakon! Finish her!

261
00:16:29,444 --> 00:16:32,879
Paru. Paru!

262
00:16:34,714 --> 00:16:35,881
Hmm!

263
00:16:36,381 --> 00:16:37,481
[Gasps]

264
00:16:37,715 --> 00:16:38,782
Paru!

265
00:16:38,882 --> 00:16:39,949
Oh no you don't!

266
00:16:40,049 --> 00:16:40,717
Paru?

267
00:16:42,851 --> 00:16:44,518
Sailor Venus!

268
00:16:46,353 --> 00:16:49,220
Threatening to harm an innocent
child, and spreading your
evil power throughout our
world?

269
00:16:49,354 --> 00:16:50,955
You people are unforgivable!

270
00:16:51,622 --> 00:16:52,956
I'm the Pretty Guardian...

271
00:16:53,056 --> 00:16:55,523
Who fights for love and for
beauty!

272
00:16:55,624 --> 00:16:57,359
I'm Sailor Venus!

273
00:16:57,758 --> 00:17:01,593
Now allow me to punish you with
love!

274
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:02,794
[Growls]

275
00:17:04,195 --> 00:17:07,030
I see! You somehow used your
powers to locate our Dark Henge
site!

276
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:08,464
Sure did!

277
00:17:08,631 --> 00:17:09,465
[Sighs]

278
00:17:11,266 --> 00:17:14,000
Damn! So to be clear, are you
saying you knew of our plan to
make the entire city sick...

279
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:17,002
...by spreading medicines laced
with Dark Power from the
hospital base?!

280
00:17:17,102 --> 00:17:18,802
Yeah! It was so obvious.

281
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:23,972
Wow! Venus is a really good
actress. Who knew! She should do
improve.

282
00:17:24,438 --> 00:17:28,440
Impressive, indeed. It seems
that I have underestimated you
girls a bit.

283
00:17:28,674 --> 00:17:30,642
Now! Pharmakon!

284
00:17:30,742 --> 00:17:31,576
Paru.

285
00:17:32,609 --> 00:17:35,411
Usagi, stop! You're in no
condition to go right now!

286
00:17:35,578 --> 00:17:38,280
I agree. You're fever's up
again, you have to stay in bed!

287
00:17:38,413 --> 00:17:42,282
I'm okay. I can't stay in bed
when Chibi-Usa needs me.

288
00:17:42,415 --> 00:17:44,982
She's in trouble. I
have to help her!

289
00:17:47,918 --> 00:17:49,885
Crescent Beam!

290
00:17:50,386 --> 00:17:50,832
Hmph!

291
00:17:50,965 --> 00:17:51,565
[Gasp]

292
00:17:51,732 --> 00:17:52,799
Paru!

[Grunt]

294
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:57,068
Venus Love Me Chain!

295
00:17:58,702 --> 00:18:00,036
Paru!

296
00:18:00,136 --> 00:18:00,870
Hmph!

297
00:18:02,204 --> 00:18:02,905
Paru!

00:18:03,138 --> 00:18:05,206
[Screams]

00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:09,041
Oh no!

00:18:09,608 --> 00:18:10,975
Paru!

301
00:18:11,075 --> 00:18:14,877
[Laughing] This battle is over!

302
00:18:14,944 --> 00:18:16,778
Make sure you get rid of the
Rabbit first!

303
00:18:16,978 --> 00:18:18,046
Paru!

304
00:18:18,579 --> 00:18:20,914
I really hate shots!

[Gasps]

00:18:24,849 --> 00:18:25,750
Hmm?

307
00:18:26,883 --> 00:18:27,717
[Gasps]

308
00:18:29,251 --> 00:18:32,519
Hospitals are a haven of healing
and comfort for people stricken
by illness.

309
00:18:32,586 --> 00:18:36,955
Filling this place with your
filthy energy and using it for
your evil plan is simply wrong!

310
00:18:37,556 --> 00:18:38,722
Mamo!

311
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:40,890
Thank you, Tuxedo Mask!

312
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:44,026
[Grunting] Oh I hate how much
you blabber!

313
00:18:44,126 --> 00:18:47,093
Pharmakon! Get rid of anyone who
interferes with our master plan!

314
00:18:47,194 --> 00:18:48,128
Paru!

315
00:18:48,228 --> 00:18:50,529
Sparkling Wide Pressure!

316
00:18:51,863 --> 00:18:52,697
Paru?

317
00:18:52,764 --> 00:18:55,665
Bubble Spray!

318
00:18:57,033 --> 00:18:58,767
Oh, great. Now what?

319
00:18:58,867 --> 00:18:59,700
Hmph!

320
00:19:01,335 --> 00:19:02,802
You're the one behind the
flu epidemic that hit the
district, aren't you?

321
00:19:02,902 --> 00:19:04,903
Now it's time for some payback!

322
00:19:05,103 --> 00:19:07,904
What are you girls doing here?
You should be in bed!

323
00:19:08,138 --> 00:19:10,072
It's okay, we've all recovered.

324
00:19:10,139 --> 00:19:12,740
Thanks to your kind, loving
care, Sailor Venus!

325
00:19:12,807 --> 00:19:14,908
Your compassion nursed us back
to health.

326
00:19:14,975 --> 00:19:16,742
We're all grateful,
Sailor Venus.

327
00:19:17,176 --> 00:19:18,777
Aw, girls.

328
00:19:18,944 --> 00:19:20,578
Pharmakon! Take care of them!

329
00:19:21,245 --> 00:19:21,912
Paru!

330
00:19:23,346 --> 00:19:25,847
Okay girls! Who wants to cure
this case of the flu once and
for all?

331
00:19:25,948 --> 00:19:29,883
I do! Burning...!

332
00:19:29,983 --> 00:19:31,884
Mandala!

333
00:19:33,117 --> 00:19:34,451
Paru!

334
00:19:34,751 --> 00:19:35,886
Now, Sailor Moon!

335
00:19:36,719 --> 00:19:37,920
[Sigh]

336
00:19:38,054 --> 00:19:38,987
Sailor Moon!

337
00:19:39,087 --> 00:19:39,721
What's wrong?

338
00:19:40,988 --> 00:19:45,057
I'm sorry. I want to do my part,
but my fever just spiked again.

339
00:19:45,224 --> 00:19:46,558
Just hang in there!

340
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:47,391
[Sigh]

341
00:19:48,259 --> 00:19:49,392
Don't give up, Sailor Moon!
[Gasps]

342
00:19:51,594 --> 00:19:56,063
Let your energy shine,
Sailor Moon. Your strong will is
what I love about you most.

343
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:58,064
Oh, Mamo.

344
00:19:58,164 --> 00:20:00,732
Yes, I will Tuxedo Mask!

345
00:20:19,874 --> 00:20:26,144
Moon Princess Halation!

346
00:20:30,447 --> 00:20:31,615
Paru!

347
00:20:32,881 --> 00:20:34,115
[Screams]

348
00:20:41,786 --> 00:20:42,786
Way to go!

349
00:20:42,886 --> 00:20:44,021
Good job Sailor Moon!

350
00:20:44,121 --> 00:20:45,021
You did it!

351
00:20:45,888 --> 00:20:47,689
Excuse me!
Huh?

352
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:52,691
Would one of you guys
mind helping me get free from
this wall? I have to pee!

353
00:20:53,092 --> 00:20:56,027
Oh! Sorry, we forgot about you!

354
00:20:56,628 --> 00:21:00,596
After everything I did for you?
Oh come on!

355
00:21:00,663 --> 00:21:02,163
[Laughter]

356
00:21:04,598 --> 00:21:07,132
Damn! I was so close!

357
00:21:07,499 --> 00:21:11,568
Sailor Guardians! You'll regret
this! [Grunting]

358
00:21:11,668 --> 00:21:14,837
[Evil Laughter]

359
00:21:16,571 --> 00:21:21,740
Fortunately, all the people who
were sick have recovered. The
sidewalks are busy and everyone
is back on their feet.

360
00:21:22,607 --> 00:21:24,608
Actually, not quite everyone.

361
00:21:24,842 --> 00:21:27,410
Artemis, please be quite.

362
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:30,478
Just my luck, I've
got the real flu.

363
00:21:30,778 --> 00:21:33,346
Yeah. And you gave it to me.

364
00:21:33,513 --> 00:21:35,447
But there is one big upside!

365
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:40,516
Since you got the flu, it must
mean you're not a fool after
all. Feel better?

366
00:21:40,616 --> 00:21:43,084
Luna, you're a
rotten caregiver.

367
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:43,885
[Giggling]

368
00:21:45,886 --> 00:21:48,587
Hello! We're here!

369
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,554
[Gasps]

370
00:21:51,222 --> 00:21:53,723
C'mon now, you have to eat! I
made a bowl of delicious rice
porridge for you!

371
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:54,790
Here!

372
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:56,091
Thanks, so much...

373
00:21:58,625 --> 00:22:00,327
[Screams]

374
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:03,895
Does it taste great, Minako? Be
honest!

375
00:22:04,129 --> 00:22:05,863
Uh, yeah.

376
00:22:07,964 --> 00:22:10,966
[Laughing] Eat plenty, okay?

377
00:22:11,032 --> 00:22:12,667
Open up for your
temperature!

378
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:16,101
[Grunt] Do that later! Don't
butt in you little meddler!

379
00:22:16,602 --> 00:22:17,602
What'd you say?

380
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:18,670
You heard me!

381
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:21,370
[Grunting]
[Fighting]

382
00:22:21,704 --> 00:22:26,473
[Groans] I think this is what
it's like to wear the shoe on
the other wild goose chase.

383
00:22:26,607 --> 00:22:28,374
Not exactly but whatever.

384
00:22:28,474 --> 00:22:31,609
Ah! Please let me sleep in
peace!

385
00:24:13,128 --> 00:24:15,596
Artemis, do you have to go?

386
00:24:15,696 --> 00:24:17,764
A cat's gotta do
what a cat's gotta do.

387
00:24:17,764 --> 00:24:19,824
But, we need you desperately!

388
00:24:19,824 --> 00:24:20,858
Oh, Usagi!

389
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:25,596
[Laughing] I couldn't help it! I
was joking!

390
00:24:25,729 --> 00:24:27,498
That's a mean trick!

391
00:24:29,166 --> 00:24:34,471
Next time on Sailor Moon R:
"Artemis's Adventure: The
Monster Animal Kingdom."

392
00:24:34,538 --> 00:24:37,374
The moonlight is a
messenger of love.
