1
00:01:58,485 --> 00:02:04,858
Poor Koan... She's been
betrayed by the very
person she loved. Now she
no longer knows what to

2
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:08,862
believe in anymore.
And it's all because
of you, Rubeus!

3
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,865
I am Sailor Moon!

4
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:15,469
And in the name of
the moon, I'll punish
you!

5
00:02:20,941 --> 00:02:22,142
Rubeus...

6
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:27,714
Your repeated failures
have greatly upset
Prince Demande.

7
00:02:28,115 --> 00:02:29,716
What? Are you sure?

8
00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:35,222
His patience is wearing
thin. Unless you fulfill
your mission as soon as
possible,

9
00:02:35,222 --> 00:02:37,824
you may very well
lose your position.

10
00:02:37,858 --> 00:02:41,128
I don't need you to
tell me that! I'm well
aware of the consequences.

11
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:46,867
I foresee that, in the
afternoon, the Rabbit will
appear, releasing a burst
of Crescent Energy.

12
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,301
Huh? Where?

13
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:52,039
The Hikawa Shrine,
which was once a
Crystal Point.

14
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:55,976
Yes, not too long ago we
contaminated that Shrine
with Dark Power.

15
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:59,012
Koan. I'll send her
there immediately.

16
00:02:59,046 --> 00:03:06,186
A word of caution. I'm
sensing an ominous aura.
Tragedy will likely befall
Koan if she goes there.

17
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:12,959
Well, that doesn't matter.
She's merely a simple pawn.
What does matter is that
we catch the Rabbit.

18
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:23,937
Battle of the Flames
of Love! Mars VS. Koan!

19
00:03:30,911 --> 00:03:32,746
Hey, Rei!

20
00:03:34,081 --> 00:03:35,048
Please slow down!

21
00:03:35,082 --> 00:03:37,884
I'm not walking that
fast. You need to
keep up!

22
00:03:37,918 --> 00:03:41,121
But these boxes aren't
that easy to manage.
They're heavy, you know.

23
00:03:41,121 --> 00:03:44,124
You're a man, aren't you?
You'd better be able to
handle them! And watch

24
00:03:44,191 --> 00:03:45,926
that you don't bump
into anybody!

25
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:47,928
Hey, cut me
some slack!

26
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:49,896
Thank you!
Come again!

27
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,298
[screaming]

28
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:53,467
Ugh! What a klutz!

29
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:54,267
[groaning]

30
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:55,435
Huh? I'm sorry!

31
00:03:55,502 --> 00:03:56,570
Are you all right!

32
00:03:56,603 --> 00:03:58,538
What's the matter with
you! Watch where you're
going!

33
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:00,307
Sorry! I'm so
sorry! Sorry!

34
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:03,076
C'mon, Yuichiro!
Hurry up and pick up
all the stuff!

35
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:05,479
Ah! Right right right
right right right right!

36
00:04:05,512 --> 00:04:09,116
Wait a minute. He's the
guy from that Protection
Aesthetics class.

37
00:04:09,149 --> 00:04:10,851
Your bag. Here you go!

38
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:13,320
Ugh!

39
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,425
Man. What a loser.

40
00:04:18,525 --> 00:04:19,159
Huh?

41
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:25,165
Guys like him will
never find love or
happiness.

42
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,502
Hey! Stop staring
at her!

43
00:04:28,502 --> 00:04:32,072
U-Uh, sorry. But I think
I've seen her somewhere
before!

44
00:04:33,173 --> 00:04:34,174
Huh?

45
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:38,345
Looks like you're
angry about something.

46
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:39,012
[gasp]

47
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:40,447
Master Rubeus!

48
00:04:40,814 --> 00:04:42,816
Been waiting
for you, Koan.

49
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:44,417
Oh! For me?!

50
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:48,522
Of course, for you.
Who else would I want
to be by my side?

51
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:50,524
Master Rubeus...

52
00:04:51,258 --> 00:04:54,961
But at the moment,
something has come up,
and I need your help
with it.

53
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:58,331
I want you to go to
the Hikawa Shrine.

54
00:04:58,832 --> 00:05:02,903
Hikawa Shrine? I've
already been to that
place once before.

55
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:05,205
This time the Rabbit
will appear there.

56
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:06,807
The Rabbit?!

57
00:05:07,174 --> 00:05:09,509
That's right.
This afternoon.

58
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:13,914
If I know for certain
that she'll be there,
she's as good as mine
right now!

59
00:05:14,014 --> 00:05:18,385
And for you, I will
slaughter her, even
if doing so costs me
my life.

60
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:19,586
Good girl...

61
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:22,088
Do not fail
me this time.

62
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:24,391
Leave it to me.

63
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:29,095
Oh, by the way,
Master Rubeus...

64
00:05:30,597 --> 00:05:35,902
When I was out shopping,
I got you a little gift. It
has a wonderful fragrance.

65
00:05:35,902 --> 00:05:38,038
I hope you will
wear it, my love.

66
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,374
How nice...

67
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:45,078
I gratefully
accept your gift.

68
00:05:45,145 --> 00:05:46,413
[gasp]

69
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:53,420
Oh my. Apparently I'm
not aware of my own
strength.

70
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:55,355
I should be
more careful.

71
00:06:22,983 --> 00:06:26,753
Master Rubeus said she
would be here for sure
this afternoon.

72
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,154
But I don't
see her yet.

73
00:06:29,155 --> 00:06:32,459
What was going on with
Master Rubeus earlier?
First he acted like he

74
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:35,395
cared about me, and
then a minute later,
he didn't.

75
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:36,897
How odd.

76
00:06:36,997 --> 00:06:39,132
Welcome to the
Hikawa Shrine!

77
00:06:39,266 --> 00:06:42,802
I'm at your service! What
can I help you with today?
A fortune slip?

78
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:44,738
An amulet? A prayer?

79
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:48,241
I know! How 'bout a
real exorcism! Tell
me what's bothering
you.

80
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:52,145
At the moment,
it's you, loser.

81
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:52,812
Huh?

82
00:06:55,048 --> 00:06:57,484
I hope that fortune
you purchased is good
for you!

83
00:06:57,484 --> 00:07:01,121
It says 'great blessings'.
My long-held wish will
come true!

84
00:07:01,221 --> 00:07:04,991
Oh! This means I have
nothing to worry about.
What a big relief!

85
00:07:05,058 --> 00:07:08,495
He must have been overly
hard-hearted and cold just
to motivate me, so I

86
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:10,864
wouldn't fail him in
this afternoon's mission.

87
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:15,268
Well, Master Rubeus,
I'll make myself even
more beautiful for you!

88
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:17,203
[screaming]

89
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:20,140
Koan, has the Rabbit
shown up yet?

90
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:22,876
N-No, there's been no
sign of her, Master.

91
00:07:23,043 --> 00:07:26,980
Even so, you shouldn't be
standing around, wasting
time preening yourself!

92
00:07:27,013 --> 00:07:29,015
I'm very sorry, Master!

93
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:31,051
How did he know?

94
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:34,988
Waiting around for the
Rabbit to appear is not
the way to get your job
done.

95
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:39,025
Get rid of every young
girl who could potentially
be the Rabbit!

96
00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:39,893
I will!

97
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:43,830
See that you do, and
don't disappoint me
again, my love.

98
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:47,067
Oh! I won't! You
can count on me!

99
00:07:48,001 --> 00:07:52,038
He called me "my love"!
He does love me! I should
have never have doubted it.

100
00:07:52,172 --> 00:07:54,941
Yuichiro! What were
you thinking?! I told

101
00:07:54,975 --> 00:08:00,080
you the chickens need to
be fed in the morning!
You idiot! How many times
do I have to repeat myself?

102
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:05,452
Heh! Those two are
certainly world's apart
from the love that Master
Rubeus and I share.

103
00:08:09,622 --> 00:08:10,890
[sigh]

104
00:08:10,924 --> 00:08:14,894
The sight of two teen
girls having parfait
snacks with cats...

105
00:08:14,928 --> 00:08:15,962
...is pretty
pathetic.

106
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:19,132
Come to think of it,
what's Usagi up to
today, Luna?

107
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,936
She went over to Rei's
place to return one of
her mangas, and hasn't
come back yet.

108
00:08:22,936 --> 00:08:26,072
And as usual, Ami's
busy attending cram
school.

109
00:08:26,106 --> 00:08:29,175
We're the only ones with
nothing to do. You're
stuck with cats!

110
00:08:29,209 --> 00:08:30,243
[laughing]

111
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:32,245
Quit laughing or we'll
get out the flea comb!

112
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,281
[sighs]

113
00:08:36,216 --> 00:08:39,953
[hysterical laughter]

114
00:08:39,953 --> 00:08:42,455
That Yuichiro
is so useless!

115
00:08:43,123 --> 00:08:45,925
Rei, this manga is
extremely hilarious!

116
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:47,293
Quit making so
much noise!

117
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:50,864
And how long do you
plan on being here
reading that manga,
anyway?!

118
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:54,834
Oh, just a little bit
longer. If I take it
home, I'll never get
to it, with Chiba-Usa

119
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:56,936
and Luna interrupting
me all the time.

120
00:08:57,003 --> 00:08:57,937
Yeah, so what?

121
00:08:58,004 --> 00:08:59,839
Excuse me,
anyone home?

122
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:00,507
Huh?

123
00:09:03,243 --> 00:09:04,577
Hi, can I help you?

124
00:09:04,611 --> 00:09:08,815
I came here to show you
some new cosmetic products
that I'm repping.

125
00:09:09,249 --> 00:09:14,087
My! You two young ladies
are lovely looking! Are
you models, by any chance?

126
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:17,357
Oh! Do you really
think we look like
models, Ma'am?

127
00:09:18,158 --> 00:09:19,526
Uh... Ma'am?

128
00:09:20,627 --> 00:09:23,997
This one is very
gentle on super-
sensitive skin.

129
00:09:24,197 --> 00:09:25,498
Mmm...

130
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,470
If you use this product,
I guarantee that you'll
find boyfriends in no
time at all.

131
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:33,139
Or do you already have
that special someone?

132
00:09:33,173 --> 00:09:36,176
Well, I wouldn't quite
call him a special
someone, but...

133
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:40,847
Hey! I do! Sort of... but
he more than qualifies
in the 'special someone'
sense.

134
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:44,818
Oh really? He's not
even a 'sort of'
boyfriend. Mamoru
dumped you.

135
00:09:44,851 --> 00:09:45,919
Shush! That's enough!

136
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:50,156
I admit I'm having a
little trouble trusting
him, and he has been
rather cold to me lately.

137
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:54,360
I don't think you understand,
Usagi. To love someone you
have to be able to trust him.

138
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,097
If you don't trust
Mamoru anymore, you
can no longer be

139
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:59,332
in any kind of
relationship with him.

140
00:09:59,466 --> 00:10:03,803
Just believe in him. No
matter how coldly he
treats you. Eventually,

141
00:10:03,837 --> 00:10:07,073
he's bound to come
around and things will
go back to normal again.

142
00:10:07,507 --> 00:10:09,175
You really think so?

143
00:10:09,242 --> 00:10:10,443
It'll be fine!

144
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:11,845
Hope you're right!

145
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:13,246
I have to disagree.

146
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,013
Huh?
Huh?

147
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:18,852
It's not about believing
in him, it's about him
believing in you. You're
loved because he sees how

148
00:10:18,852 --> 00:10:21,955
beautiful you are and
that he can't live
without you. But
to continue to love

149
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:25,024
him when he treats
you coldly is frankly
just pathetic.

150
00:10:25,525 --> 00:10:26,860
So, you're saying-

151
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:28,495
I'm saying forget
about him.

152
00:10:28,528 --> 00:10:30,530
Never ever ever!

153
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:31,464
You must.

154
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:33,299
And then...

155
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:35,502
Pamper yourself with
beauty treatments to
make you so desirable

156
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:38,304
that no guy would
dare treat you
coldly again!

157
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:43,309
Wear fabulous makeup that
highlights your best
features and dazzles any
guy who comes near!

158
00:10:44,177 --> 00:10:46,179
That is what love
is all about!

159
00:10:46,246 --> 00:10:48,014
Uhhh...

160
00:10:49,616 --> 00:10:53,119
I got so carried away
with my own speech, I
nearly forgot about
my mission here!

161
00:10:53,186 --> 00:10:56,856
You know, I think
I'll pass on the
makeup.

162
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:58,958
Oh...
Well...

163
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:02,262
By the way, are there
any little girls who
might hang out in
this area?

164
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:04,063
Why are you
asking that?

165
00:11:04,097 --> 00:11:08,368
Oh, I have cosmetics
for little girls, as
well. You can never
start too early.

166
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:10,303
Sorry, no little
girls here.

167
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:12,238
Well, thank you
for your time!

168
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:15,241
She was weird.

169
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:19,012
This is a bad luck day,
starting with you, and
then that lady.

170
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:20,380
[growling]

171
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:23,082
I guess they're not
expecting the Rabbit to
come by this afternoon.

172
00:11:23,316 --> 00:11:27,353
In that case, I'm just
going to have to be
patient, and see if
she shows up.

173
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:35,762
Sailor Moon R!

174
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:51,311
Sailor Moon R!

175
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,316
Gotta go!
See ya later!

176
00:11:56,349 --> 00:11:58,818
Oh, you leaving
so soon, Usagi?

177
00:11:58,918 --> 00:12:01,154
Yeah, I'll be back
again! Bye-Bye!

178
00:12:01,154 --> 00:12:02,121
See ya!

179
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,058
Oh...

180
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:07,293
Hop-hop-hop!

181
00:12:07,327 --> 00:12:10,330
Slow down, Chibi-Usa.
Don't tell me you're
heading to Rei's place

182
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:11,965
just to read her
manga again!

183
00:12:11,998 --> 00:12:15,535
What about you?!
I see what you got
there! 'Bghhh!

184
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:18,938
Ugh! She's so annoying!

185
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:22,208
Ah-h! Hey,
wait for me!

186
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:24,477
There you are.

187
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:27,280
Huh? Huh? Huh?
Ahhhh!

188
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:32,485
[screaming]

189
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:34,754
[screaming]

190
00:12:35,822 --> 00:12:36,756
[chuckling]

191
00:12:37,624 --> 00:12:39,325
I was getting tired
of waiting, Rabbit!

192
00:12:39,993 --> 00:12:41,094
Who did that?

193
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:43,663
Hey, leave Chibi-Usa
alone or I'll whack
you again!

194
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:48,434
How dare you! Don't
tell me you had the
nerve to hit me over
the head with that

195
00:12:48,468 --> 00:12:51,137
filthy broom of yours,
mister? What were you
thinking?

196
00:12:51,137 --> 00:12:52,739
Huh?

197
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:56,209
You know how long it
takes to look this
good? Listen! No one
messes with my hair!

198
00:12:56,242 --> 00:12:56,909
Got it?!

199
00:12:57,143 --> 00:12:59,879
Dark Fire!

200
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:05,518
[scared breathing]

201
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:08,221
[screaming]

202
00:13:08,554 --> 00:13:09,889
What's going on?!

203
00:13:12,492 --> 00:13:13,826
It's Koan!

204
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:16,229
Die!

205
00:13:16,396 --> 00:13:17,163
[grunting]

206
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:19,632
Get up, Yuichiro!
Run!

207
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:20,900
Right!

208
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,202
Quit interfering!
I've got work to do!

209
00:13:27,373 --> 00:13:30,209
[screaming]

210
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:31,978
[laughing]

211
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:34,180
Die!

212
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:35,181
Oh no!

213
00:13:35,214 --> 00:13:35,982
Rei!

214
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:38,151
[grunting]

215
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:43,956
Yuichiro!

216
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:45,224
But why?!

217
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:48,961
Why did you protect her,
when all she ever does
it treat you badly?

218
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:50,063
Please, Yuichiro!

219
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,865
All that matters to
me is that I love her!

220
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,769
That's the stupidest thing
I've ever heard! Why would
you love someone who doesn't

221
00:13:56,803 --> 00:13:58,104
seem to care about
you at all?!

222
00:13:58,538 --> 00:14:02,909
I can't stop the way
I feel. And I don't
want to!

223
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:03,450
[painful breath]

224
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:04,544
No, Yuichiro!

225
00:14:04,577 --> 00:14:07,447
Please don't die!
You've gotta hold
on, Yuichiro!

226
00:14:13,586 --> 00:14:16,956
You monster! I'll
make you pay for
this!

227
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:23,896
Mars Star Power!
Make Up!

228
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:39,345
[gasp]

229
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:42,081
You- You were a Sailor
Guardian all along?!

230
00:14:44,117 --> 00:14:47,253
Burning...

231
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:53,126
...Mandala!

232
00:14:56,229 --> 00:15:01,134
This is a surprise.
Although it sort of
works in my favor. If
I kill you along with

233
00:15:01,167 --> 00:15:03,469
the Rabbit, Master
Rubeus will be so
pleased!

234
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:05,238
[grunting]

235
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:12,812
Heh!

236
00:15:13,012 --> 00:15:13,846
Hah!

237
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:21,454
[gasp]

238
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:24,190
[screaming]

239
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:29,429
Agh!

240
00:15:36,803 --> 00:15:38,171
[screaming]

241
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,976
Fool! If you had
abandoned him, you
could have escaped!

242
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:46,078
I would never do
that to Yuichiro!

243
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:49,015
Never! It's because
of me that he was hurt!

244
00:15:49,015 --> 00:15:52,351
He was protecting me,
and I can always trust
him to be there for me!

245
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:53,786
Hmph!

246
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:57,457
I remember you said that
trust was important in
any kind of relationship.

247
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:58,524
[gasp]

248
00:15:58,591 --> 00:16:01,928
You're that saleswoman!
Aren't you?!

249
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:07,099
What do you see in this
guy that you have to
protect him? I think he's
a loser without any good

250
00:16:07,099 --> 00:16:09,969
qualities, he follows
you around like a lost
puppy!

251
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:14,407
The good qualities you
missed is that he's
sincere and caring!

252
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:17,977
[chuckle]

253
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:22,048
If that's it, then you
two can't win against
the love that Master
Rubeus and I share.

254
00:16:22,415 --> 00:16:25,918
Ridiculous! Yours
is all about loving
yourself!

255
00:16:26,385 --> 00:16:30,423
You don't even think
about how the other
person feels. Or care...

256
00:16:30,923 --> 00:16:32,859
What you have is
not true love!

257
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:33,493
[gasp]

258
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:38,097
Of course it's true
love! We're very,
very close! He calls
me his love!

259
00:16:38,598 --> 00:16:39,866
[gasping]

260
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:42,468
Yeah? But what do
his actions tell
you?

261
00:16:42,802 --> 00:16:43,402
[gasping]

262
00:16:47,073 --> 00:16:51,511
No! That's not how it
is! I'm not going to
listen! Just shut up!

263
00:16:51,544 --> 00:16:53,012
[gasping]

264
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:57,416
I've heard enough of
your silly nonsense.
I'll be back to take
care of you as soon

265
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:58,985
as I eliminate
the Rabbit.

266
00:16:59,085 --> 00:17:00,152
No!

267
00:17:04,257 --> 00:17:05,925
Huh? What is this?

268
00:17:07,894 --> 00:17:13,266
The image of love shimmering
in the sun. Come, you sad,
lost soul. Listen to the
sound of a loving heart.

269
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:14,967
Huh?

270
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:20,907
Farewell...

271
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:23,476
Hey!, you! Wait!
Come back!

272
00:17:24,977 --> 00:17:25,778
[gasp]

273
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:30,716
Damn you!

274
00:17:32,285 --> 00:17:34,287
I'm right here in
front of you! Take
me on!

275
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,221
[growling]

276
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:36,122
Koan!

277
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:36,956
[gasp]

278
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:39,158
Master Rubeus!

279
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:42,929
So? Have you taken
care of the Rabbit
yet?

280
00:17:43,162 --> 00:17:48,868
Um, I'm very sorry,
Master. I did have her
for a minute, but she
got away.

281
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:52,972
Once again,
you've failed.

282
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:56,742
You've worked for me for
a long time, but you've
never had much success.

283
00:17:56,809 --> 00:18:00,346
That being said, let me
add that we won't be
seeing each other anymore.

284
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:02,882
Give me one more
chance, Master.

285
00:18:02,882 --> 00:18:06,852
I'm in the middle of a
battle with that Sailor
Guardian over there.
I'll kill her...

286
00:18:06,886 --> 00:18:08,387
...to make up for
my failures!

287
00:18:08,521 --> 00:18:11,624
You no longer have the
power necessary to
fight her.

288
00:18:11,657 --> 00:18:15,194
Then you could help
me. As a couple, we
could fight her
together.

289
00:18:15,628 --> 00:18:21,367
Hmph! Where'd you get
the idea we're a couple?
You're just a lowly
incompetent subordinate?

290
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:24,103
How can you say that?

291
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:28,474
I've loved you for
so long. And you
love me!

292
00:18:28,507 --> 00:18:31,711
Love, you say? Ha!
What foolishness!

293
00:18:32,211 --> 00:18:37,049
I've never loved you!
In truth, there is no
such thing as love in
the Black Moon Clan!

294
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:38,284
[horrified gasp]

295
00:18:46,025 --> 00:18:48,828
This will be my
first and last
gift to you.

296
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:50,396
Just take it.

297
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:55,001
But...
This is...

298
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:58,838
Something to erase
that Sailor Guardian
from this world.

299
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:02,942
I think you'll find it
to be quite a useful
gift. Unlike that stupid

300
00:19:03,009 --> 00:19:04,910
cosmetic fragrance
you gave me.

301
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:10,383
A Space-Time
Bomb. Oh...

302
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:12,284
He wants me
gone for good.

303
00:19:12,618 --> 00:19:14,787
What? Don't
activate it!

304
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,256
Koan! Get rid
of it... now!

305
00:19:17,623 --> 00:19:19,425
No. Too late.

306
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:20,393
[gasp]

307
00:19:20,626 --> 00:19:23,062
You win.
Sailor Mars...

308
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:27,233
You were right.
My love wasn't
real.

309
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:37,510
Venus...
Love me...
Chain!

310
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:38,778
[gasp]

311
00:19:39,545 --> 00:19:43,382
Sparkling Wide
Pressure!

00:19:48,454 --> 00:19:50,423
[grunting]

313
00:19:50,456 --> 00:19:51,424
Uh...

314
00:19:53,893 --> 00:19:56,395
Surrender yourself
right now, Koan!

315
00:19:56,462 --> 00:19:58,431
Don't try to run
away this time.

316
00:19:59,065 --> 00:20:00,800
I have nowhere
to run to.

317
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:01,967
Huh?

318
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:03,335
[crying]

319
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:06,939
I've always been able
to run away and go where
I felt I was beautiful.

320
00:20:07,273 --> 00:20:13,946
But now I have been
banished forever. I've
lost everything. And
it's because of you!

321
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:15,514
It's all your fault!

322
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:16,282
[gasp]

323
00:20:16,449 --> 00:20:18,117
[screaming]

324
00:20:18,584 --> 00:20:19,385
Agh!

325
00:20:19,418 --> 00:20:20,286
[screaming]

326
00:20:21,921 --> 00:20:28,127
My life is over! I've
lost everything! My
home! My family! My
love! There is no

327
00:20:28,127 --> 00:20:30,529
future! I'm not
welcome anywhere!

328
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:32,098
It's all your fault!

329
00:20:32,131 --> 00:20:33,799
Stop! Let her go!

330
00:20:33,866 --> 00:20:35,901
[sobbing]

331
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:38,170
[roaring]

332
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:41,507
[gasp]

333
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:44,777
[gasps]

334
00:20:44,777 --> 00:20:46,011
Sailor Mars!

335
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:48,047
You protected her?

336
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,282
You're life isn't
over, Koan.

337
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:55,788
You see? Now you have
a chance to start anew.

338
00:20:56,422 --> 00:21:00,192
To begin with, you're
still here. And all that
was wrong before, you can

339
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,495
make right, a
little bit at
a time.

340
00:21:03,529 --> 00:21:06,599
Your future begins
right now.

341
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,234
Trust me...

342
00:21:16,342 --> 00:21:20,279
Sailor Moon. Please
turn her into a normal
human woman.

343
00:21:20,346 --> 00:21:23,282
I wish I could, but
I don't know if it'll
work.

344
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:27,253
Use the Silver Crystal.
Let's see if that will
work on her.

345
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:31,824
Perhaps it doesn't have
the full power it once
had, but it may be able
to turn her into a normal

346
00:21:31,857 --> 00:21:34,260
woman, since she's
in a very fragile
state.

347
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:35,461
Give it a try.

348
00:21:35,494 --> 00:21:36,262
Hm!

349
00:21:36,362 --> 00:21:37,530
Alright, then!

350
00:21:38,164 --> 00:21:40,366
Please...
Silver Crystal.

351
00:21:42,268 --> 00:21:45,938
Moon Crystal Power!

352
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:52,111
Refresh!

353
00:21:57,516 --> 00:22:00,553
Yuichiro, I still see
streaks. In order to
get them out you'll

354
00:22:00,586 --> 00:22:02,254
really need to put
your back into it!

355
00:22:02,254 --> 00:22:03,088
Yes, ma'am!

356
00:22:03,255 --> 00:22:04,089
My back's in it!

357
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:04,990
[sigh]

358
00:22:05,024 --> 00:22:06,425
Guess I'm gonna
have to live with
it.

359
00:22:06,425 --> 00:22:08,260
Yoo-hoo! Is
anyone home?

360
00:22:08,427 --> 00:22:12,164
I'm here to show you
some brand new cosmetic
products that I'm repping.

361
00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:14,166
Hm?

362
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,035
Hey! Don't I
know you?

363
00:22:16,068 --> 00:22:17,236
[laugh]

364
00:22:17,303 --> 00:22:21,073
You two look like the
perfect couple. I'm
a little envious.

365
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:22,908
[giggle]

366
00:22:24,043 --> 00:22:27,313
Looks like you're
finally happy. Good
for you, Koan.

Check!

00:24:12,718 --> 00:24:13,719
Hold on a minute!

00:24:13,719 --> 00:24:15,554
Usagi, this is your
one-hundred-and-first
try.

371
00:24:15,621 --> 00:24:20,392
Uh! Ami, you're not only
academically smart, but
you're also a wiz at
playing chess!

372
00:24:20,392 --> 00:24:23,896
Chess strengthens your
calmness and precise
decision-making skills.

373
00:24:23,896 --> 00:24:26,398
Guess I don't have to
worry about that ever
happening!

374
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:29,134
You shouldn't keep
avoiding important
things, Usagi.

Next time on Sailor Moon R:
"For Friendship: Ami vs.
Berthier"

The moonlight is a
messenger of love.
