1
00:01:57,523 --> 00:01:59,865
What are we gonna do?
Chibi-Usa knows our real

2
00:01:59,865 --> 00:02:02,395
identities. And to make
things worse, she just

3
00:02:02,428 --> 00:02:08,568
took my brooch! If the
enemy ever finds out
about that. Wait, is that huge UFO?! Okay,

4
00:02:08,601 --> 00:02:12,405
okay, I can handle it.
After all, I am Sailor
Moon!

5
00:02:12,605 --> 00:02:15,475
And in the name of
the Moon, I'll punish
you!

6
00:02:31,624 --> 00:02:34,060
It's true. It's true!

7
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:57,550
I can't believe it.
Usagi is the legendary

8
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:00,720
Guardian... Sailor Moon!
And Rei and the others

9
00:03:00,787 --> 00:03:02,855
are Sailor Guardians
also!

10
00:03:35,521 --> 00:03:39,492
"A UFO Appears: The
Sailor Guardians
Abducted."

11
00:03:45,631 --> 00:03:49,569
This time for sure. I
will eliminate the Rabbit
and take back the Silver

12
00:03:49,635 --> 00:03:51,537
Crystal from this
grotesque world!

13
00:03:51,637 --> 00:03:52,471
[screaming]

14
00:03:52,505 --> 00:03:55,775
[laughter]

15
00:03:55,808 --> 00:03:57,143
Huh?

16
00:04:16,929 --> 00:04:18,197
Esmeraude?!

17
00:04:18,698 --> 00:04:19,699
[giggling]

18
00:04:19,732 --> 00:04:22,201
It's been a while,
hasn't it, Rubeus?

19
00:04:24,437 --> 00:04:29,175
Ah, so this is Tokyo's
Juban District in the
20th century. I find it

20
00:04:29,175 --> 00:04:31,210
quite small and
disgusting, don't
you?

21
00:04:31,611 --> 00:04:33,012
[giggle]

22
00:04:33,012 --> 00:04:35,848
I wonder if I'll be
okay staying in such a
filthy little village.

23
00:04:35,882 --> 00:04:38,284
Wait, what is that
supposed to mean?

24
00:04:40,186 --> 00:04:44,090
Oh no, haven't you heard?
Because of your repeated
failures, Rubeus, you've
been dismissed from your

25
00:04:44,123 --> 00:04:47,593
assignment to eliminate
the Rabbit and seize the
Juban District.

26
00:04:47,627 --> 00:04:50,696
As of tomorrow, I'll
be completely in charge
here.

27
00:04:51,464 --> 00:04:55,368
Nonsense! Prince Demande
would never undermine all
of my work like that!

28
00:04:55,401 --> 00:04:58,738
I know! His decision
came as a shock to
me too!

29
00:04:58,771 --> 00:05:01,240
I guess he hates
gross incompetence.

30
00:05:01,574 --> 00:05:06,579
That's what it would have
to take on your part to
truly anger such a sweet
and gentle prince.

31
00:05:06,579 --> 00:05:07,280
Hnnh!

32
00:05:09,181 --> 00:05:13,252
Your first failure was to
lose the Four Spectre
Sisters. Then, you were
unable to convert a single

33
00:05:13,252 --> 00:05:18,624
Crystal Point to Dark
Power. And lastly, you
couldn't find the Silver
Crystal nor the Rabbit.

34
00:05:19,325 --> 00:05:24,597
It's curious why he let
you continue to serve him
as long as he did. Right
before he sent me,

35
00:05:24,597 --> 00:05:29,368
he said that an
embarrassment like you
is no longer necessary
in our glorious clan.

36
00:05:29,435 --> 00:05:30,336
Hnnh!

37
00:05:32,305 --> 00:05:36,409
You seem skeptical. If
you don't believe me, you
should go see for yourself.
That is, only if you have

38
00:05:36,409 --> 00:05:39,478
the guts to show your
face and talk to the
prince in person.

39
00:05:40,746 --> 00:05:42,248
[growling]

40
00:05:42,281 --> 00:05:46,085
Anyway, while you deal
with your new problems,
I'll take care of things
here.

41
00:05:46,118 --> 00:05:47,420
See you!

42
00:05:52,425 --> 00:05:53,993
[growling]

43
00:05:54,026 --> 00:05:56,862
I have to defeat Sailor
Moon and the Sailor
Guardians, and eliminate
the Rabbit.

44
00:05:56,929 --> 00:06:00,333
If I succeed, I'll
appease the prince and
restore my good name!

45
00:06:00,366 --> 00:06:03,769
Lucky for me, I
already know where
the Silver Crystal is.

46
00:06:12,845 --> 00:06:14,313
I'm home!

47
00:06:14,413 --> 00:06:15,681
Welcome back.

48
00:06:16,882 --> 00:06:18,651
Why are you in
such a rush?

49
00:06:18,651 --> 00:06:20,319
Gotta hurry.
Gotta hurry.

50
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:24,223
Inside her brooch.
It's the Silver
Crystal!

51
00:06:25,257 --> 00:06:28,327
If I have that,
I can rescue Mommy!

52
00:06:29,762 --> 00:06:31,163
Hey there, Chibi-Usa!

53
00:06:31,831 --> 00:06:33,099
Hiya!

54
00:06:34,233 --> 00:06:37,370
Gotta hurry.
Gotta hurry.
I'm hurrying!
I'm hurrying!

55
00:06:37,403 --> 00:06:39,405
I promised I
wouldn't be
late again!

56
00:06:41,374 --> 00:06:42,641
See you later!

57
00:06:42,675 --> 00:06:45,244
Hold on, Usagi.
Didn't you take a
test today?

58
00:06:45,311 --> 00:06:48,414
Sure, sure. But I
can't talk about it
now. I've gotta run!
Buh-bye!

59
00:06:49,215 --> 00:06:51,317
Ugh! She drives
me nuts!

60
00:06:56,655 --> 00:07:01,227
These past few days,
there's been a spike in
confirmed UFO sightings.

61
00:07:01,327 --> 00:07:04,897
Do you think they might
be connected to the enemy
attacks we've seen lately?

62
00:07:04,964 --> 00:07:09,502
I can't say for sure, but
it's certainly alarming.
We can't let our guard
down, now matter what.

63
00:07:09,568 --> 00:07:10,736
Sorry I'm late!

64
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:11,771
Usagi!

65
00:07:11,804 --> 00:07:13,472
Yeah, I know, sorry!

66
00:07:13,506 --> 00:07:16,742
Ah! These cookies look
awesome! Can I try some?

67
00:07:16,776 --> 00:07:21,447
Of course! I baked them
in home ec class, but
then I realized I made
too many. So help yourself!

68
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:25,284
Thanks! Don't mind if
I do! You're the best,
Mako! Yum, these are
really good!

69
00:07:25,317 --> 00:07:29,221
So, Usagi... We were
talking about the
attacks, and how the

70
00:07:29,255 --> 00:07:32,224
enemy is clearly
after Chibi-Usa.

71
00:07:32,258 --> 00:07:36,562
Our job is clear. We
can't take our eyes
off Chibi-Usa. She's
our top priority.

72
00:07:36,595 --> 00:07:39,832
Absolutely! We're all
she's got and she
desperately needs us.

73
00:07:39,899 --> 00:07:41,667
We have to make sure
we protect her.

74
00:07:45,237 --> 00:07:49,575
Doesn't it smell yummy?
For today's snack, I'm
making your favorite,
hotcakes.

75
00:07:49,608 --> 00:07:53,212
Hayay! But why're
you making so many
of them?

76
00:07:53,245 --> 00:07:57,483
Just in cast. I have
a feeling Shingo and
Usagi will want some,
too.

77
00:07:57,583 --> 00:08:00,453
Aww. It must be hard
being a Mommy.

78
00:08:00,453 --> 00:08:01,120
Oh?

79
00:08:02,888 --> 00:08:06,358
You know, because you're
always thinking of Usagi
and trying hard to do
nice things for her.

80
00:08:06,459 --> 00:08:09,895
That's true! It's nice
to be appreciated for
once.

81
00:08:09,962 --> 00:08:11,697
[giggle]

82
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:15,468
But this is what mothers
do all around the world.
Even if they usually
don't get a thank you.

83
00:08:15,468 --> 00:08:17,369
Mother's all
around the world?

84
00:08:17,403 --> 00:08:23,309
Sure. That's our job, to
love our kids more than
anyone. And to shower them
with love whenever we can.

85
00:08:23,342 --> 00:08:26,445
Aww. Showered with
love sounds nice.

86
00:08:27,847 --> 00:08:32,785
But I want you to know
something. Chibi-Usa,
I love you, too. To the
moon and back, and that

87
00:08:32,818 --> 00:08:34,620
will never change.
Okay?

88
00:08:34,887 --> 00:08:36,122
[gasp]

89
00:08:36,222 --> 00:08:37,289
[giggling]

90
00:08:45,197 --> 00:08:47,833
Ugh! Look at
this mess!

91
00:08:52,238 --> 00:08:53,139
[gasp]

92
00:08:53,172 --> 00:08:56,041
The Legendary Silver
Crystal is inside there!

93
00:08:56,142 --> 00:08:58,110
She's so careless
with it!

94
00:08:59,178 --> 00:09:03,516
Moon Crystal Power!

95
00:09:22,935 --> 00:09:26,772
With this crystal,
I can... I can
rescue Mommy.

96
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:33,579
But Usagi is Sailor
Moon. She's saved
me so many times!

97
00:09:35,181 --> 00:09:38,751
I really should trust
her with the crystal
and let her use its
power.

98
00:09:38,784 --> 00:09:39,785
I'm home!

99
00:09:39,852 --> 00:09:41,020
[gasp]

100
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:44,089
Welcome back! I just
made hotcakes for you.
What do you say?

101
00:09:44,123 --> 00:09:45,291
[groaning]

102
00:09:45,357 --> 00:09:49,128
I don't want any! I'm
already stuffed with
Mako's cookies.

103
00:09:49,261 --> 00:09:50,129
[gasp]

104
00:09:50,196 --> 00:09:53,098
Her Mommy made those
hotcakes just for her!

105
00:09:53,132 --> 00:09:57,469
Someone so ungrateful
can't possibly be the
true Guardian.

106
00:09:58,871 --> 00:10:02,107
Mommy, I'm going to
rescue you, after all!

107
00:10:02,841 --> 00:10:05,511
Come on, Usagi! You
really need to get
your act together!

108
00:10:05,544 --> 00:10:08,714
Forgetting your
brooch, of all
things? It's so
irresponsible.

109
00:10:08,847 --> 00:10:10,282
I know, I know, I know!

110
00:10:14,853 --> 00:10:15,688
[gasp]

111
00:10:17,223 --> 00:10:18,290
It's not here!

112
00:10:18,357 --> 00:10:19,558
Where'd it go?!

113
00:10:19,858 --> 00:10:22,528
I hate her so much!

114
00:10:22,861 --> 00:10:26,265
How did I ever think
I could trust her to
keep me safe!

115
00:10:41,513 --> 00:10:42,514
Wiseman?

116
00:10:44,383 --> 00:10:46,118
The time has come.

117
00:10:46,552 --> 00:10:50,856
I can sense that the
Silver Crystal is now
in the Rabbit's hands.

118
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:53,025
My chance is
finally here!

119
00:10:53,058 --> 00:10:58,864
The Rabbit will appear
in the forest at dusk.
Head northwest,
Rubeus.

120
00:10:58,897 --> 00:11:00,332
I shall!

121
00:11:03,769 --> 00:11:04,937
[ringing]

122
00:11:04,937 --> 00:11:06,605
We've got a problem,
everyone!

123
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:11,243
It looks like Chibi-
Usa took my brooch and
now we can't figure out
where she is!

124
00:11:11,744 --> 00:11:15,481
This is serious. Okay,
we should all split
up and find Chibi-Usa!

125
00:11:15,514 --> 00:11:16,315
Right!

126
00:11:26,525 --> 00:11:28,260
Wait for me, Mommy!

127
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,663
I'm coming back
to the future!

128
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:38,270
O Guardian of Time! Tear
apart the heavens and open
wide for me the Door of
Space and Time!

129
00:11:40,706 --> 00:11:41,507
Huh?

130
00:11:50,316 --> 00:11:54,253
What went wrong? I
don't get it. Why
didn't anything
happen?

131
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:58,524
I beg you! Please!
Return me to the
future!

132
00:11:59,158 --> 00:12:06,498
[weeping]

133
00:12:14,006 --> 00:12:15,140
[gasp]

134
00:12:15,641 --> 00:12:17,176
[chuckling]

135
00:12:17,409 --> 00:12:18,310
[gasp]

136
00:12:31,657 --> 00:12:34,660
Sailor Moon R!

137
00:12:48,173 --> 00:12:50,743
Sailor Moon R!

138
00:12:55,347 --> 00:12:58,150
Aha! I found you
at last, Rabbit.

139
00:13:00,319 --> 00:13:01,553
Ah! Die!

140
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:02,554
Hah!

141
00:13:03,455 --> 00:13:04,723
Hah!

142
00:13:08,227 --> 00:13:09,561
Chibi-Usa!

143
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:12,398
Sailor Mars!

144
00:13:13,899 --> 00:13:15,901
Oh no you don't!

145
00:13:15,934 --> 00:13:19,738
Sailor Mars! Quick,
take Chibi-Usa somewhere
safe, now!

146
00:13:19,738 --> 00:13:21,407
Bubble!

147
00:13:24,376 --> 00:13:25,611
Spray!

148
00:13:26,412 --> 00:13:27,546
Dammit!

149
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:33,419
You can put
me down, Rei.

150
00:13:33,452 --> 00:13:34,219
Huh?!

151
00:13:36,655 --> 00:13:39,658
I found out your
secret. I know who
all of you really are.

152
00:13:39,725 --> 00:13:41,226
B-But how?

153
00:13:42,227 --> 00:13:43,729
We took care
of Rubeus.

154
00:13:44,229 --> 00:13:46,398
That was a close
call, Chibi-Usa.

155
00:13:46,632 --> 00:13:50,235
I guess I should say
thank you to you guys.
But I don't wanna since

156
00:13:50,235 --> 00:13:52,137
you're all best friends
with that Usagi.

157
00:13:52,171 --> 00:13:52,671
[surprised gasps]

158
00:13:54,173 --> 00:13:57,643
I know why you rescued
me. You only came here
because I have Usagi's
brooch!

159
00:13:57,709 --> 00:13:59,545
And to scold me
like I'm a baby!

160
00:13:59,545 --> 00:14:04,316
That's not true at all,
Chibi-Usa. We came to
protect you because
Usagi and the rest of

161
00:14:04,349 --> 00:14:05,784
us were worried
about you.

162
00:14:07,186 --> 00:14:10,222
Usagi has no right to
keep this brooch! She
doesn't deserve it.

163
00:14:10,289 --> 00:14:11,790
I've seen her be
quite selfish.

164
00:14:11,824 --> 00:14:14,827
She's not responsible.
She only thinks of
herself.

165
00:14:15,861 --> 00:14:19,731
Please don't think that
way about Usagi. I know
she's trying her best.

166
00:14:19,798 --> 00:14:21,133
Really?

167
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:24,970
Of course! I mean,
after all nobody's
perfect but I love
Usagi!

168
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:28,440
I do, too! I don't know
anyone who's more fun to
be with than Usagi.

169
00:14:28,474 --> 00:14:32,678
Yeah, I totally agree!
Plus, Usagi's always
thinking about other
people.

170
00:14:32,711 --> 00:14:34,446
Especially you,
Chibi-Usa.

171
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,516
You're all lying to
me! Stop lying!

172
00:14:37,549 --> 00:14:38,484
Look out!

173
00:14:41,153 --> 00:14:41,787
Watch it!

174
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,055
Stupid kid!

175
00:14:44,323 --> 00:14:47,159
I'll go where no one's
around. Somewhere where
I can be alone!

176
00:14:55,567 --> 00:14:56,802
[chuckling]

177
00:14:56,802 --> 00:14:57,836
Rabbit...

178
00:14:59,571 --> 00:15:03,742
You can run and you
can hide. But I will
know the second you try
to return to the future.

179
00:15:06,912 --> 00:15:08,180
Did you find her?

180
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:09,615
No, we haven't.

181
00:15:09,681 --> 00:15:12,351
The situation is worse
than we thought. If
Chibi-Usa has the brooch,

182
00:15:12,351 --> 00:15:14,186
then she also has
the Silver Crystal!

183
00:15:14,253 --> 00:15:15,787
Yeah, that's right!

184
00:15:15,854 --> 00:15:19,525
And that's precisely what
Rubeus is after, which
means she's in more danger

185
00:15:19,525 --> 00:15:21,527
than ever! We've got
to find her!

186
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:26,532
They just don't give
up! I swear I won't
let anyone have this
brooch.

187
00:15:27,533 --> 00:15:30,235
Which would be
easier if I
weren't so tired!

188
00:15:36,575 --> 00:15:37,843
Ten o'clock...

189
00:15:39,077 --> 00:15:42,047
It's already past her
bedtime. Poor girl must
be so exhausted!

190
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:53,559
Chibi-Usa?

191
00:16:00,866 --> 00:16:02,868
This enemy won't
stop chasing us!

192
00:16:02,935 --> 00:16:05,704
We're outnumbered!
We have to get out
of here fast!

193
00:16:05,771 --> 00:16:09,408
We've almost brought
Small Lady to safety!
Just a little farther!

194
00:16:09,508 --> 00:16:12,844
If only Sailor Moon were
here! This never would
have happened!

195
00:16:15,247 --> 00:16:16,315
[screaming]

196
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:23,522
Everyone..

197
00:16:26,792 --> 00:16:28,093
How are you
feeling?

198
00:16:28,794 --> 00:16:30,262
Mamo...

199
00:16:33,532 --> 00:16:38,203
You're safe now. Don't
cry, pretty little lady.
If you look sad, even

200
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:41,773
this rose will wilt.
Here, take it. It's
for you.

201
00:16:42,307 --> 00:16:43,275
Thank you!

202
00:16:44,743 --> 00:16:48,614
Let me introduce
myself. My name is
Tuxedo Mask.

203
00:16:49,915 --> 00:16:52,317
Were you having
a scary dream?

204
00:16:52,351 --> 00:16:55,621
Yes. Hey, Mr.
Tuxedo Mask...

205
00:16:55,654 --> 00:16:57,255
Hm? What is it?

206
00:16:57,255 --> 00:17:00,225
I was wondering if
Sailor Moon is very
strong?

207
00:17:00,258 --> 00:17:02,761
Yes. Invincible.

208
00:17:03,662 --> 00:17:05,197
Oh...

209
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:06,331
[stomach grumbling]

210
00:17:06,765 --> 00:17:08,266
[laughing]

211
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:10,235
Wait here. I'll fix
you something to eat.

212
00:17:10,702 --> 00:17:11,903
Any requests?

213
00:17:13,372 --> 00:17:14,773
Hotcakes!

214
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,843
Hotcakes,
huh? Okay.

215
00:17:19,211 --> 00:17:20,245
[doorbell ringing]

216
00:17:20,979 --> 00:17:21,813
Mamo!

217
00:17:21,847 --> 00:17:22,514
[gasp]

218
00:17:23,148 --> 00:17:24,516
Has Chibi-Usa
come here?

219
00:17:26,852 --> 00:17:30,522
Luna P Transform!

220
00:17:35,761 --> 00:17:37,062
Chibi-Usa!

221
00:17:37,195 --> 00:17:39,164
Mamo! Where's
Chibi-Usa?

222
00:17:39,164 --> 00:17:41,199
Sorry, bad news.
You just missed her.

223
00:17:41,233 --> 00:17:42,067
[gasp]

224
00:17:44,503 --> 00:17:45,704
Come back!

225
00:17:52,511 --> 00:17:55,480
This time, I'm going
back to the future
for sure!

226
00:17:55,514 --> 00:17:56,581
[screaming]

227
00:18:07,726 --> 00:18:12,164
It's working! I'm
going back to see
my Mommy.

228
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:20,238
What's wrong?!

229
00:18:20,572 --> 00:18:25,811
[screaming]

230
00:18:33,719 --> 00:18:35,120
W-what's that?!

231
00:18:35,721 --> 00:18:37,222
Oh my gosh!

232
00:18:37,255 --> 00:18:38,156
Holy-!

233
00:18:38,223 --> 00:18:40,225
That ship is huge!

234
00:18:40,325 --> 00:18:41,393
Is that a...

235
00:18:41,426 --> 00:18:43,795
UFO? Yes!

236
00:18:50,902 --> 00:18:52,604
[evil laughter]

237
00:18:52,637 --> 00:18:54,573
Hello, Rabbit...

238
00:18:54,606 --> 00:18:59,377
No matter where you are,
when you attempt to return
to the future, you cause a
distortion in space-time.

239
00:18:59,377 --> 00:19:02,481
This ship will always
lead me there. And
I'll find you!

240
00:19:04,449 --> 00:19:05,317
[scared gasp]

241
00:19:06,184 --> 00:19:09,287
Now then, Rabbit.
Are you ready to
die?

242
00:19:09,321 --> 00:19:11,356
[evil laughter]

243
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:13,291
Not if we can
help it!

244
00:19:14,893 --> 00:19:19,498
Don't worry, Chibi-Usa.
We're here and we won't
let that jerk take you
anywhere.

245
00:19:19,798 --> 00:19:24,469
Hah! Fine, then I'll
eliminate you guardian
girls together along
with her!

246
00:19:24,469 --> 00:19:25,837
Argh! Don't
mess with us!

247
00:19:25,871 --> 00:19:29,608
Sparkling Wide
Pressure!

248
00:19:29,775 --> 00:19:32,310
Burning!

249
00:19:34,346 --> 00:19:37,783
Mandala!

250
00:19:38,183 --> 00:19:41,052
Venus Love
Me Chain!

251
00:19:44,623 --> 00:19:46,291
[evil laughter]

252
00:19:47,659 --> 00:19:50,162
He's protected by an
invisible shield that
our attacks can't break!

253
00:19:50,195 --> 00:19:52,164
It must be incredibly
powerful!

254
00:19:52,297 --> 00:19:54,466
Stop your useless
resistance!

255
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:57,335
[grunting]

256
00:20:00,806 --> 00:20:02,174
E-Everyone...

257
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,275
[gasp]

258
00:20:03,275 --> 00:20:05,777
Now's your chance!
Run! Get away quickly!

259
00:20:05,811 --> 00:20:07,379
That's not going
to happen!

260
00:20:07,546 --> 00:20:08,613
Haaaaah!

261
00:20:14,653 --> 00:20:16,321
What is that light?!

262
00:20:16,888 --> 00:20:18,390
What's he doing?!

263
00:20:18,456 --> 00:20:19,825
My body feels heavy!

264
00:20:19,858 --> 00:20:24,563
There's incredible energy
in this beam. Emanating
directly from the UFO!

265
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:33,305
It's too strong! The
only way to fight against
this is to combine our
powers!

266
00:20:33,338 --> 00:20:34,506
[gasp]

267
00:20:34,539 --> 00:20:37,776
Are you saying that
we use our Sailor
Planet Power?!

268
00:20:37,776 --> 00:20:42,514
But we're still one guardian
short! We won't have enough
power. We need Sailor Moon!

269
00:20:42,681 --> 00:20:46,618
We might not be able to
save ourselves, but we've
gotta save Chibi-Usa!

270
00:20:46,618 --> 00:20:47,385
[gasp]

271
00:20:49,487 --> 00:20:51,489
You're right!
We have to try!

272
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,696
Jupiter Star Power!

273
00:20:57,896 --> 00:21:01,299
Venus Star Power!

274
00:21:01,366 --> 00:21:04,202
Mercury Star Power!

275
00:21:04,236 --> 00:21:07,138
Mars Star Power!

276
00:21:09,241 --> 00:21:12,177
Sailor Planet Power!

277
00:21:20,352 --> 00:21:22,187
Hmph! Fools!

278
00:21:22,187 --> 00:21:24,890
Ch-Chibi-Usa, get
away from here!

279
00:21:24,923 --> 00:21:27,225
[scared whimper]

280
00:21:27,259 --> 00:21:29,194
Run! Save
yourself now!

281
00:21:29,194 --> 00:21:30,362
[gasp]

282
00:21:30,395 --> 00:21:33,298
She's gonna be okay.
I have her now. You
guys hurry, too!

283
00:21:33,732 --> 00:21:35,800
Fine, let's
play rough!

284
00:21:35,867 --> 00:21:38,103
[attacking grunts]

285
00:21:39,371 --> 00:21:43,508
[struggling grunts]

286
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:46,711
[screaming]

287
00:21:47,178 --> 00:21:48,346
Oh no!

288
00:21:49,681 --> 00:21:53,852
Usagi, please, take
care of Chibi-Usa!

289
00:22:01,426 --> 00:22:03,261
Come back!

290
00:22:03,361 --> 00:22:05,830
[evil laughter]

291
00:22:05,864 --> 00:22:06,932
They're gone...

292
00:22:06,998 --> 00:22:09,200
Are you all right,
Chibi-Usa?

293
00:22:09,267 --> 00:22:10,368
[whimper]

294
00:22:11,336 --> 00:22:12,704
Chibi-Usa!

295
00:22:12,771 --> 00:22:14,172
[whimper]

296
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:22,480
Stupid! You ruined
everything! This is
all your fault!

297
00:22:25,317 --> 00:22:32,424
[evil laugher]

298
00:24:11,489 --> 00:24:16,428
Okay, Sailor Moon! It's
the end of the line! I
order you to surrender.
Hand over the Silver

299
00:24:16,461 --> 00:24:17,896
Crystal and the Rabbit
without a fight!

300
00:24:17,896 --> 00:24:20,598
Forget it, Rubeus! We
won't let you win in
our world and we'll

301
00:24:20,632 --> 00:24:22,300
stop you from
controlling the
future!

302
00:24:22,333 --> 00:24:23,568
[evil laughter]

303
00:24:23,601 --> 00:24:26,571
Resistance is futile!
It's time to die!

304
00:24:26,771 --> 00:24:31,643
Next time on Sailor Moon R:
"Defeat Rubeus: The Battle
in Space."

305
00:24:31,709 --> 00:24:34,579
The moonlight is a
messenger of love.
