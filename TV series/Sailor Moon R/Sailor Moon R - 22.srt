1
00:01:57,893 --> 00:02:01,126
Chibi-Usa... please
tell me the truth.

2
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:05,026
Who are you, and where
did you really come
from?

3
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:10,560
Back off, Black Moon
Clan! I won't forgive you
guys for threatening this
young girl!

4
00:02:10,593 --> 00:02:15,926
I am Sailor Moon...
And in the name
of the moon,
I'll punish you!

5
00:02:28,126 --> 00:02:32,026
Mamo...I can't
believe it, but we're
finally married.

6
00:02:37,293 --> 00:02:39,693
[squeals of delight]

7
00:02:40,193 --> 00:02:41,260
It's cold!

8
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:47,726
Ah, I'm soaking wet...

9
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:51,026
Huh...Oh.

10
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:57,093
It was just a
dream...but it
sure felt real.

11
00:02:57,126 --> 00:02:58,626
[small resigned sigh]

12
00:02:59,193 --> 00:02:59,993
What?!

13
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:03,093
[loud screaming]

14
00:03:03,126 --> 00:03:04,293
[irritated groan]

15
00:03:04,326 --> 00:03:06,160
[small upset gasp]

16
00:03:06,193 --> 00:03:09,626
Why are you making
such a ruckus
screaming at the
top of your lungs?

17
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,826
It's too late for
this. You'll wake
everybody up!

18
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,226
[gasp]

19
00:03:14,393 --> 00:03:18,626
Uh...uh..Usagi, did
you, ah...Did you
happen to, ah...!

20
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,126
[embarrassed quivering]

21
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:24,193
You're in middle school!
In your second year!

22
00:03:24,226 --> 00:03:25,760
[embarrassed quivering]

23
00:03:26,093 --> 00:03:27,926
It's true, I can
hardly believe it.

24
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:31,793
You...You...I...
Can't even say it.
Did you wet the bed?!

25
00:03:31,826 --> 00:03:33,126
[embarrassed
squeaky sounds]

26
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:37,226
Oh...My, my, my,
my...embarrassing!

27
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,226
[nervous squealing]

28
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,160
[small notice]

29
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:43,660
[fussing sounds
in her sleep]

30
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,093
[peaceful sleeping
sighs]

31
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,126
[angry grunts
as she wakes up]

32
00:03:51,626 --> 00:03:54,160
Chibi-Usa!

33
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:03,160
Protect Chibi-Usa:
Clash of the
Ten Warriors.

34
00:04:17,093 --> 00:04:18,960
I foresee...

35
00:04:21,193 --> 00:04:27,926
...When the sun rises at the
break of dawn, there will be an
energy burst at an overpass in
the district called Juban...

36
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,726
An overpass in the
Juban district...
Who will produce this
energy?

37
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,626
It is the rabbit.

38
00:04:34,893 --> 00:04:38,860
Ah! I will send the
four Spectre Sisters
to keep an eye
on that area.

39
00:04:38,893 --> 00:04:43,026
So tell me
Wiseman, how
are things in
your century?

40
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:46,226
Has Crystal Tokyo
fallen yet?

41
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:58,226
Our clan should have
taken over most
of the area of Crystal
Tokyo by now.

42
00:05:03,093 --> 00:05:10,326
True. However, powerful
protective energy is
bursting from the Crystal
points around the castle.

43
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:13,926
Powerful energy?
Who is it
coming from?

44
00:05:14,593 --> 00:05:18,060
The Four Guardians
of Crystal Tokyo.

45
00:05:18,093 --> 00:05:22,926
They are the ones
who stand in our
way and are
producing this energy.

46
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:29,293
In this world, the ones
known as Sailor Guardians
have been constantly
foiling our plans.

47
00:05:29,326 --> 00:05:30,626
I wonder...

48
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:35,260
Perhaps there is some
sort of connection between
them and the Four Guardians
of Crystal Tokyo.

49
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:39,893
You must find
the Silver Crystal
as soon as possible...

50
00:05:39,926 --> 00:05:41,893
...And destroy it.

51
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:44,826
Hmph...

52
00:05:46,293 --> 00:05:52,060
Spectre Sisters, I've
got orders for you!
Make your appearance
right now!

53
00:05:52,093 --> 00:05:53,293
[grunting]

54
00:05:53,326 --> 00:05:54,926
[laughing]

55
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:59,226
I know you do
some pretty stupid
things, but bed-wetting at
your age is beyond lame.

56
00:05:59,993 --> 00:06:01,826
Hey! Stop
saying that!

57
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:04,226
Get it through your
thick skull! I
didn't wet my bed!

58
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:07,726
Then why are
you beating yucky
wet stuff out of
your mattress cover?

59
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,760
'Cause Chiba-Usa
did it!

60
00:06:09,793 --> 00:06:13,026
Sure...Blame it
on the kid who
can't defend herself.

61
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:14,960
Listen you idiot!

62
00:06:14,993 --> 00:06:15,993
Oh.

63
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,660
Just where do
you think you're
going!

64
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:24,626
[gasp]

65
00:06:26,626 --> 00:06:28,860
Hey! Come
back here!

66
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,693
I can't stand
that kid!

67
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,593
Chibi-Usa was
probably feeling
a little lonely...

68
00:06:37,626 --> 00:06:38,793
Lonely?

69
00:06:38,826 --> 00:06:41,793
That's right. That's
why she snuck into
your bed last night.

70
00:06:41,826 --> 00:06:47,793
Aww...Poor little
kid. And you totally
ragged on her just because
she wet your bed.

71
00:06:47,826 --> 00:06:50,860
You did the same
thing to me when
you thought I was
the one who did it.

72
00:06:50,893 --> 00:06:53,293
Well, you usually
deserve to be
ragged on.

73
00:06:53,326 --> 00:06:54,726
[startled grunt]

74
00:06:55,993 --> 00:06:58,193
Anyway, you need
to go and find her
and apologize right
away.

75
00:06:59,993 --> 00:07:04,060
But I already promised Rei
and the others that I would
go shopping with them
this afternoon.

76
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:06,960
Promise or not,
this is more
important!

77
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:11,560
If she's upset about
last night, she might
release her energy
again at any moment!

78
00:07:11,593 --> 00:07:13,160
Fine. I'll
apologize.

79
00:07:13,193 --> 00:07:17,326
We've gotta find
her quickly, we need
to spread out and go
in different directions.

80
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,160
So, you go the
other way.

81
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,793
[heavy sigh]

82
00:07:23,793 --> 00:07:26,893
Get up!
Quit wasting
time!
[startled reaction]

83
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:37,126
What's Usagi's
problem? I'm just
a kid. It's not so
weird I wet the bed.

84
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:41,760
[upset sigh]

85
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:58,693
[quiet crying]

86
00:08:03,793 --> 00:08:05,126
Mommy!

87
00:08:07,826 --> 00:08:11,160
[small sobs]

88
00:08:12,593 --> 00:08:15,193
I'm sorry...

89
00:08:24,093 --> 00:08:28,926
Mommy...

90
00:08:31,293 --> 00:08:34,793
Mommy...Daddy...

91
00:08:34,826 --> 00:08:37,693
I would like to go home.

92
00:08:42,593 --> 00:08:48,760
While that key allows
you to travel through time
you mustn't use it
impulsively, it's dangerous.

93
00:08:48,793 --> 00:08:50,760
[loud wailing]

94
00:08:55,093 --> 00:08:58,726
[small sob]

95
00:09:00,126 --> 00:09:01,760
[gasp]

96
00:09:02,326 --> 00:09:04,626
I'm sorry Puu...

97
00:09:05,793 --> 00:09:11,493
But I wanna go home!

98
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,660
[small gasp]

99
00:09:33,126 --> 00:09:35,726
I did it!

100
00:09:37,693 --> 00:09:39,526
[yelp]

101
00:09:39,926 --> 00:09:41,826
What happened?

102
00:09:42,126 --> 00:09:44,160
Why can't
I go?

103
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:48,726
I wanna go
home to mommy...

104
00:09:48,760 --> 00:10:01,060
[long loud sobbing]

105
00:10:01,093 --> 00:10:05,260
[gasp]
That's Chibi-Usa's
energy! Oh no!

106
00:10:05,293 --> 00:10:12,860
[sobbing]

107
00:10:13,926 --> 00:10:15,093
Oh, my...

108
00:10:15,126 --> 00:10:16,060
[fearful gasp]

109
00:10:16,926 --> 00:10:19,293
What's wrong?
Did something sad happen?

110
00:10:19,326 --> 00:10:20,993
[sinister giggle]

111
00:10:21,026 --> 00:10:22,626
Hello, Rabbit.

112
00:10:22,993 --> 00:10:24,860
[fearful gasp]

113
00:10:24,893 --> 00:10:29,293
Stop right there
sister! I spotted her
energy way before
you did.

114
00:10:29,326 --> 00:10:32,960
Oh really? But I
got here before
you.

115
00:10:32,993 --> 00:10:35,193
So...in the
interest of fairness

116
00:10:35,226 --> 00:10:37,560
Let's agree that
whoever kills
the rabbit...

117
00:10:37,593 --> 00:10:38,993
...Is the winner.

118
00:10:40,926 --> 00:10:44,793
[evil laughter]

119
00:10:45,093 --> 00:10:50,126
[giggles]

120
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,293
[surprised yelp]

121
00:10:51,326 --> 00:10:55,226
[sounds of pain]

122
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,293
[startled gasp]

123
00:10:56,326 --> 00:10:58,526
[painful yelp]
No way!

124
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,893
[laugh]
You snooze
you lose sister!

125
00:11:01,926 --> 00:11:03,693
[startled gasp]

126
00:11:03,726 --> 00:11:05,760
There's no escape.

127
00:11:08,026 --> 00:11:09,893
Luna P!

128
00:11:10,793 --> 00:11:12,526
[scoff]

129
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,793
[attack meow]
What?!

130
00:11:14,826 --> 00:11:16,126
[painful yelling
and meowing]

131
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,260
[giggles]

132
00:11:19,293 --> 00:11:21,526
You snooze
you lose, Koan.

133
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,960
[yelp]

134
00:11:26,126 --> 00:11:28,060
[painful gasp]

135
00:11:28,326 --> 00:11:30,860
You won't get
away, Rabbit!

136
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:37,260
Chibi-Usa...
[exhausted breathe]

137
00:11:39,926 --> 00:11:43,660
Sailor Moon!
'R'!

138
00:11:56,421 --> 00:12:00,254
Sailor Moon R!

139
00:12:02,454 --> 00:12:06,187
Usagi sure is
late today...I
wonder what's
keeping her?

140
00:12:06,221 --> 00:12:08,154
I hope nothing's
happened...

141
00:12:08,187 --> 00:12:10,354
Probably overslept
and forgot
about us.

142
00:12:10,387 --> 00:12:13,354
Well...We
should wait
a little bit
longer.

143
00:12:13,387 --> 00:12:14,521
[gasp]
Luna!

144
00:12:14,554 --> 00:12:16,287
[in unison gasp]

145
00:12:19,354 --> 00:12:23,254
[quiver]
Very bad news...
the enemy is closing
in on Chibi-Usa.

146
00:12:23,287 --> 00:12:24,054
Was she attacked?

147
00:12:24,087 --> 00:12:25,121
Where are they?

148
00:12:25,154 --> 00:12:27,387
Near Juban
park by the
overpass.

149
00:12:27,421 --> 00:12:29,154
You better hurry!

150
00:12:29,187 --> 00:12:31,854
Let's go!
Artemis, take
care of Luna.

151
00:12:41,121 --> 00:12:43,154
Huh?
Chibi-Usa?

152
00:12:43,187 --> 00:12:45,321
Where could
she be going?

153
00:12:49,054 --> 00:12:50,487
[exhales worriedly]

154
00:12:56,154 --> 00:13:00,954
I don't want to,
But I guess I
really should
apologize.

155
00:13:00,987 --> 00:13:02,054
[soft crying]

156
00:13:02,087 --> 00:13:03,487
Is she crying?

157
00:13:04,687 --> 00:13:06,154
[sniffles]

158
00:13:10,921 --> 00:13:12,154
Puu...

159
00:13:12,187 --> 00:13:15,454
What's wrong
small lady? I
see you're crying.

160
00:13:15,487 --> 00:13:17,154
[soft whimper]

161
00:13:17,187 --> 00:13:20,387
Don't cry,
you are a
strong girl.

162
00:13:20,421 --> 00:13:23,354
Can't help it...
I'm scared.

163
00:13:24,321 --> 00:13:25,621
Pull yourself
together.

164
00:13:25,654 --> 00:13:28,987
You have
powerful friends that
are always there to
help you out.

165
00:13:29,021 --> 00:13:30,421
I don't have
any friends.

166
00:13:30,687 --> 00:13:33,421
Huh?
Who's she
talking to?

167
00:13:33,454 --> 00:13:38,054
That is not true.
The Sailor Guardians
have come to your
aid many times.

168
00:13:38,087 --> 00:13:42,354
Well yeah...
but those bad guys
are too powerful.
They scare me!

169
00:13:42,387 --> 00:13:45,387
[whimpering]
They hurt
my mommy...

170
00:13:46,287 --> 00:13:48,854
...And made
her end up
like that!

171
00:13:49,054 --> 00:13:51,221
And even daddy
couldn't beat
them...

172
00:13:51,254 --> 00:13:53,654
[small sobs]

173
00:13:53,687 --> 00:13:58,054
Do you also
remember that
in the early
days of your life...

174
00:13:58,087 --> 00:13:59,587
[soft gasp]

175
00:14:01,021 --> 00:14:05,254
There were guardians
who always looked
after you in the
future capitol.

176
00:14:05,287 --> 00:14:08,354
They were by your
side whenever
you needed them.

177
00:14:12,087 --> 00:14:17,087
Those same guardians
are fighting to protect
Crystal Tokyo
as we speak.

178
00:14:17,121 --> 00:14:19,587
And even in the
world you are in
right now...

179
00:14:20,287 --> 00:14:24,387
...You must trust
the Guardians,
especially Sailor
Moon.

180
00:14:24,421 --> 00:14:27,887
They will always
do whatever
it takes to help you.

181
00:14:27,921 --> 00:14:29,887
Puu!

182
00:14:31,587 --> 00:14:34,887
Puu...

183
00:14:36,987 --> 00:14:40,254
So Chibi-Usa
lost her mom
because of them...

184
00:14:40,287 --> 00:14:42,121
I've got you,
Rabbit!

185
00:14:42,154 --> 00:14:43,354
[startled gasp]

186
00:14:43,387 --> 00:14:46,054
[trembling in fear]

187
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:53,921
Bet you didn't
think I'd find
you hiding in
here.

188
00:14:54,121 --> 00:14:56,021
Hang on, Chibi-Usa...

189
00:14:56,054 --> 00:15:01,087
Moon Crystal Power!
Make...Up!

190
00:15:41,287 --> 00:15:43,587
[giggles]

191
00:15:43,621 --> 00:15:45,587
[whimpers]

192
00:15:46,187 --> 00:15:48,254
Heh...
It's over.

193
00:15:48,287 --> 00:15:49,587
Stop right there!

194
00:15:50,954 --> 00:15:52,854
Sailor Moon!

195
00:15:54,521 --> 00:15:58,487
How dare you pick
on that brave young
girl from the future, who
came here all alone!

196
00:16:00,121 --> 00:16:04,121
Now in the name
of the moon,
I'll punish you!

197
00:16:04,154 --> 00:16:05,254
Hmph.

198
00:16:05,454 --> 00:16:06,254
[soft grunt]

199
00:16:06,621 --> 00:16:10,921
Well, I'm
not alone...
Meet my sisters!

200
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:13,654
Petz, the oldest.

201
00:16:13,687 --> 00:16:15,287
Calaveras. next.

202
00:16:15,321 --> 00:16:17,187
Berthier, third oldest.

203
00:16:17,221 --> 00:16:18,554
And Koan. the youngest.

204
00:16:18,587 --> 00:16:20,087
[fearful exhale]

205
00:16:20,121 --> 00:16:21,054
We're from...

206
00:16:21,954 --> 00:16:23,087
The tenth planet...

207
00:16:23,121 --> 00:16:24,521
In this solar system.

208
00:16:24,554 --> 00:16:26,287
...The Black Moon.

209
00:16:27,387 --> 00:16:29,254
[in unison]
We're the
Spectre Sisters!

210
00:16:29,487 --> 00:16:30,887
[nervous breathe]

211
00:16:32,254 --> 00:16:34,954
[gasping in unison]

212
00:16:42,654 --> 00:16:44,354
Sailor Mars!

213
00:16:44,387 --> 00:16:46,087
Sailor Mercury!

214
00:16:46,121 --> 00:16:47,954
Sailor Jupiter!

215
00:16:47,987 --> 00:16:49,521
Sailor Venus!

216
00:16:49,554 --> 00:16:51,421
[in unison]
We're the
Sailor Guardians!

217
00:16:52,687 --> 00:16:54,387
You're here!

218
00:17:49,087 --> 00:17:53,387
[painful screaming]

219
00:17:57,254 --> 00:18:00,587
[groan]

220
00:18:01,387 --> 00:18:03,421
Sailor Moon!

221
00:18:05,021 --> 00:18:08,154
[quiet breathing]

222
00:18:08,987 --> 00:18:10,487
Playtime is over.

223
00:18:10,521 --> 00:18:11,387
Who are you?

224
00:18:12,687 --> 00:18:16,521
Who am, I you
ask? I am Crimson
Rubeus, of the Black
Moon Clan.

225
00:18:16,554 --> 00:18:18,354
Why are you
after her?

226
00:18:18,621 --> 00:18:22,087
We are on a
mission to change
the future of
this metropolis.

227
00:18:22,121 --> 00:18:25,254
And the only
way for that to
happen is...

228
00:18:32,021 --> 00:18:35,421
...For her to die!

229
00:18:37,254 --> 00:18:38,521
[gasps]

230
00:18:38,554 --> 00:18:40,354
[yelling]

231
00:18:44,121 --> 00:18:46,054
[grunt]

232
00:18:46,421 --> 00:18:49,987
[gasp before
yelling in pain]

233
00:18:50,021 --> 00:18:51,254
[gasp]

234
00:18:54,221 --> 00:18:55,921
[grunt of pain]

235
00:18:55,954 --> 00:18:57,221
[laughter]

236
00:18:58,187 --> 00:19:02,121
Sailor Moon!
Sailor Moon!

237
00:19:04,321 --> 00:19:06,187
She's precocious...

238
00:19:07,421 --> 00:19:08,954
...Mischievous.

239
00:19:08,987 --> 00:19:11,887
And pretty annoying,
and yet...

240
00:19:12,921 --> 00:19:15,054
[soft crying]
Sailor Moon...

241
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:17,954
...I can't seem to hate her.

242
00:19:21,187 --> 00:19:23,087
It's all over.

243
00:19:23,321 --> 00:19:25,054
[teary gasp]

244
00:19:25,087 --> 00:19:26,621
[sinister laughter]

245
00:19:26,987 --> 00:19:28,154
Not quite...

246
00:19:29,121 --> 00:19:31,587
...I refuse to be
defeated this easily.

247
00:19:32,521 --> 00:19:36,421
I will...
Protect her...

248
00:19:36,454 --> 00:19:37,454
...With my life!

249
00:19:37,687 --> 00:19:39,221
What?
[gasp]

250
00:19:40,154 --> 00:19:41,154
[surprised gasp]

251
00:19:42,154 --> 00:19:44,587
How dare you
go and threaten
such a young life?

252
00:19:44,621 --> 00:19:46,087
I won't
forgive you!

253
00:19:46,487 --> 00:19:47,921
Shut the
hell up!

254
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:51,121
[grunt]

255
00:19:52,454 --> 00:19:55,221
[grunting and
battle cries]

256
00:19:55,921 --> 00:19:57,121
What?!

257
00:20:00,554 --> 00:20:02,954
[screaming in pain]

258
00:20:04,487 --> 00:20:09,354
Sailor Moon...you
are the only one
who can protect this
child. Do it.

259
00:20:09,387 --> 00:20:10,987
Right!

260
00:20:29,987 --> 00:20:38,087
Moon Princess...
Halation!

261
00:20:40,054 --> 00:20:43,087
[groaning in
pain]

262
00:20:44,387 --> 00:20:46,654
[in unison]
Master Rubeus!

263
00:20:46,687 --> 00:20:50,987
[grunt]
Spectre Sisters!
Retreat, now!

264
00:20:53,687 --> 00:20:57,521
In due time...
I'll have my
revenge!

265
00:21:04,387 --> 00:21:08,887
Hey, Chibi-Usa...
I want you to
tell me the truth.

266
00:21:09,154 --> 00:21:11,354
As far as I know
you came from the
future.

267
00:21:11,654 --> 00:21:16,354
But what did those
guys mean about the
tenth planet, and the
Black Moon Clan?

268
00:21:17,187 --> 00:21:19,221
And...what did
they do to your
mother?

269
00:21:19,454 --> 00:21:23,421
[sobbing]

270
00:21:24,187 --> 00:21:25,854
Sailor Moon!
[crying]

271
00:21:26,554 --> 00:21:30,087
Please Sailor Moon...
help my mommy...

272
00:21:30,621 --> 00:21:32,421
Save her from
those bad people!

273
00:21:33,921 --> 00:21:36,921
Puu told me that
I could count on
you and the other
Guardians to help me...

274
00:21:37,321 --> 00:21:44,421
[crying]
Please help
my mommy.

275
00:21:44,454 --> 00:21:46,321
Chibi-Usa...

276
00:21:46,354 --> 00:21:53,554
[quiet sobs]

277
00:21:58,921 --> 00:22:05,421
A flower no matter
how beautiful,
withers in the
course of time.

278
00:22:05,954 --> 00:22:07,154
So inevitably...

279
00:22:08,921 --> 00:22:13,421
...The beautiful Rabbit's
mother and the city of
Crystal Tokyo will have
the same ending...

280
00:22:13,954 --> 00:22:17,487
[maniacal laughter]

281
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:14,780
And then she's
awakened by a kiss
from a prince who
truly loves her!

282
00:24:15,014 --> 00:24:16,414
How romantic!

283
00:24:18,047 --> 00:24:20,180
I've heard it before.
Believing in fairy tales
in this day and age
is so childish.

284
00:24:20,214 --> 00:24:21,414
You're such a brat!

285
00:24:22,714 --> 00:24:25,614
Who says I believe in
fairy tales? I don't need
to. I have Mamo.

286
00:24:25,647 --> 00:24:27,414
Oh yeah? Well,
Mamo has a new
love.

287
00:24:27,647 --> 00:24:28,814
This is a
nightmare!

288
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:34,447
Next time on
Sailor Moon R:
Awaken the Sleeping
Beauty: Mamoru's distress.

289
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,561
The Moonlight
is a messenger
of love.
