I'm very sorry about that.

We're headed up

Thank you for bringing her by.

00:04:12.711 --> 00:04:15.088
Hello, and welcome
to the Quindecim.

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:18.550
My name is Decim.
I'm the bartender here.

00:04:18.592 --> 00:04:22.053
Hey, it's nice to meet you.
So, uh, what is this pla--?

00:04:22.095 --> 00:04:24.306
This is where the
deceased come first.

The deceased?
Dead people, you mean?

00:04:27.976 --> 00:04:31.188
[NONA] Right. Two deceased
will be coming here shortly.

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:32.856
We're going to ask
them to play a game

00:04:32.898 --> 00:04:35.525
on which their lives are staked.

00:04:35.567 --> 00:04:36.443
Okay.

00:04:36.485 --> 00:04:38.278
[NONA] We're here to pass
judgment on the deceased,

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:39.821
based on their memories.

00:04:39.863 --> 00:04:41.823
We also consider the
humanity they exhibit

00:04:41.865 --> 00:04:44.117
during their time here with us.

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:47.871
As you will see, we
function as arbiters.

00:04:47.913 --> 00:04:49.873
Arbiters? Uh...

00:04:49.915 --> 00:04:50.832
Hey.

00:04:50.874 --> 00:04:54.211
It seems like this is coming
as sort of a surprise to you.

00:04:56.004 --> 00:04:56.922
Anyway.

00:04:56.963 --> 00:04:59.257
The deceased will arrive
here, but before they do,

00:04:59.299 --> 00:05:00.967
their memories are
all compiled together

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:02.969
and sent to the arbiters.

00:05:03.011 --> 00:05:04.596
Compiled how?

00:05:04.638 --> 00:05:07.349
Let's see, what's the
best way to describe it?

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:10.143
It's kind of like a
kaleidoscope of images.

00:05:10.185 --> 00:05:12.229

will be starring these two.

Not that they are
aware of it, of course.

00:07:05.342 --> 00:07:07.844
The shock of dying tends
to make people forget.

00:07:07.886 --> 00:07:10.388
And, for now, that's the
way we want to keep it.

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:11.514
Why is that?

00:07:11.556 --> 00:07:13.683
[NONA] Well, if they knew
that they were dead,

00:07:13.725 --> 00:07:17.437
I doubt they'd stake
their lives on a game.

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:18.605
Why would they, anyway?

00:07:18.647 --> 00:07:20.690
That kind of bet doesn't
seem worth making.

00:07:20.732 --> 00:07:22.734
[NONA] True, and normally,
they wouldn't.

00:07:22.776 --> 00:07:25.070
We have to do a
little convincing.

00:07:25.111 --> 00:07:25.820
How?

00:07:25.862 --> 00:07:27.155
By making them
think their lives

00:07:27.197 --> 00:07:29.491
are at a greater risk
if they don't play.

00:07:29.532 --> 00:07:31.326
That's what's going
on right now.

00:07:31.368 --> 00:07:33.828
So all this is to
intimidate them into playing?

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:36.581
Yes, exactly. So sit still.

what he says for now.

happen if we don't?

00:07:40.669 --> 00:07:43.004

I don't understand.
Why go to such lengths?

00:07:58.144 --> 00:08:01.147
[NONA] It's necessary to
reach the right verdict.

00:08:01.189 --> 00:08:04.734
Accurately reading people
can require extreme conditions.

00:08:04.776 --> 00:08:06.903
In this case, that means
having them risk their lives

00:08:06.945 --> 00:08:08.321
on some contest.

00:08:08.363 --> 00:08:10.573
Well, that does sound extreme.

00:08:10.615 --> 00:08:12.200
Like I said,
it's designed to be.

00:08:12.242 --> 00:08:14.786
The whole idea is to
create severe tension.

00:08:14.828 --> 00:08:16.705
Mental and emotional,
for the most part.

their whole life story?

00:08:27.966 --> 00:08:29.634
[NONA] Because we can't
accurately judge people

on their memories alone.

00:08:31.469 --> 00:08:33.596
They must be made to
expose the darkest parts

00:08:33.638 --> 00:08:35.724
of their being so the
arbiters can come to know

00:08:35.765 --> 00:08:37.225
the whole person.

00:08:37.267 --> 00:08:40.061
Only then can we judge them
and decide their fates.

00:08:40.103 --> 00:08:42.522
One game can do all that?

00:08:42.564 --> 00:08:44.774
[NONA]
Still not convinced, are you?

00:08:44.816 --> 00:08:47.068
Do you happen to know what
the most primitive emotion

00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:49.487
human beings experience is?

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:52.866

What happened?

00:09:24.105 --> 00:09:27.317
This game does involve
some physical pain.

00:09:27.358 --> 00:09:28.359
How?

00:09:28.401 --> 00:09:30.570
[NONA] He hit the shoulder
area of the target,

00:09:30.612 --> 00:09:32.822
so Machiko's shoulder
started to hurt.

00:09:32.864 --> 00:09:34.824
How is that possible?

00:09:34.866 --> 00:09:36.117

Baby! Does it really hurt?

00:09:39.871 --> 00:09:41.873
[NONA]
I'd say that one was the lungs.

00:09:41.915 --> 00:09:45.126
In this game, the players throw
seven darts at two targets,

00:09:45.168 --> 00:09:48.171
the areas of which are linked
to parts of their bodies.

00:09:48.213 --> 00:09:51.841
Almost as if they were being
made to stab each other.

00:09:51.883 --> 00:09:54.385
[WOMAN]
This is going too far.

00:09:54.427 --> 00:09:56.721
You'll get used
to it soon enough.

00:10:00.141 --> 00:10:03.269
[WOMAN] Oh, I get it.
They can just miss.

00:10:03.311 --> 00:10:06.856
Decim tipped them off to that,
but it's really not that simple.

00:10:06.898 --> 00:10:08.108
Why?

00:10:08.149 --> 00:10:09.984
Look at the scores.

00:10:12.779 --> 00:10:14.739
[NONA] If they keep on
missing like this,

00:10:14.781 --> 00:10:16.616
Machiko will be the winner.

00:10:16.658 --> 00:10:18.118
[WOMAN]
That's fine, isn't it?

00:10:18.159 --> 00:10:20.286
From where you're
sitting, maybe it is,

00:10:20.328 --> 00:10:22.622
but not for the ones
who are playing the game.

00:10:22.664 --> 00:10:25.625
They think whoever loses
stands a chance of being killed.

00:10:25.667 --> 00:10:26.835
But nobody ever said--

00:10:26.876 --> 00:10:29.087
True enough. Nobody said it.

00:10:29.129 --> 00:10:31.673
But really, what are
they supposed to think?

[TAKASHI gasps]

[NONA] The mind is very
susceptible to such suggestions.

Nobody wants to do something

00:10:38.888 --> 00:10:40.640
that will lead to
their own death.

00:10:40.682 --> 00:10:43.476

I didn't mean to.

There, did you see that?

00:10:52.694 --> 00:10:53.903
It was intentional?

00:10:53.945 --> 00:10:55.655
It certainly seemed
like it was.

00:10:55.697 --> 00:10:57.991
but we can only be sure
about their memories.

00:10:58.032 --> 00:11:00.410

We don't know what
their motives are.

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:04.622
So, it's just a hunch?

00:11:04.664 --> 00:11:07.458
Well, an outsider
might call it that.

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:09.460
But these judgments
require experience

00:11:09.502 --> 00:11:14.174
and the ability to observe,
which we arbiters have.

00:11:14.215 --> 00:11:17.760
[TAKASHI groans]
My eyes!

00:11:19.637 --> 00:11:20.138
[gasps]

00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:22.390
People are fascinating,
don't you think?

00:11:22.432 --> 00:11:24.934
Even after all I've seen,
there are still so many things

00:11:24.976 --> 00:11:27.395
I don't know about
how the mind works.

00:11:27.437 --> 00:11:30.315
Oh, by the way, it might be
useful to know how they died.

00:11:30.356 --> 00:11:31.482
[gasps]

00:11:31.524 --> 00:11:32.859
[NONA]
They got into a car accident

00:11:32.901 --> 00:11:34.360
while they were
on their honeymoon

00:11:34.402 --> 00:11:37.488
because Takashi thought
Machiko was cheating.

00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:39.407
[WOMAN]
That's terrible!

00:11:41.534 --> 00:11:43.578
[MACHIKO]
It's your child.

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:45.288
Why didn't you say something?

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:46.748
[MACHIKO]
I was going to.

00:11:46.789 --> 00:11:49.459
I wanted to surprise
you during our trip.

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:51.878
I haven't told anybody yet.

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:55.340
I wanted you to be
the first one to know.

00:11:55.381 --> 00:11:57.467
I'm glad I was.

00:11:57.508 --> 00:11:59.510
I'm so happy, honey.

00:12:01.095 --> 00:12:04.307
[TAKASHI] I can't believe I'm
finally going to be a father!

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:08.645
[gasps]

00:12:13.441 --> 00:12:15.985
[groans]

00:12:16.027 --> 00:12:19.280
[panting]

00:12:19.322 --> 00:12:21.532
Their memories are
beginning to return.

00:12:21.574 --> 00:12:22.659
What?

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:26.079
It's set up so that they're
stimulated as the game goes on.

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:28.623
We have no way of knowing
what they're going to remember.

00:12:28.665 --> 00:12:30.291
But it will have to
do with their deaths.

00:12:30.333 --> 00:12:31.459
[gasps]

00:12:31.501 --> 00:12:32.877
[NONA] These are things
they've forgotten

00:12:32.919 --> 00:12:39.008
due to the shock of dying.
We have to evoke them. Forcibly.

00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:53.898
[DECIM] Congratulations.
You are the winner, Machiko.

00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:56.859
And with that, the game
is officially at an end.

00:12:56.901 --> 00:12:59.237
If you would both please
move over this way.

00:12:59.279 --> 00:13:03.366
Just a minute! Please!
One more throw! Just one!

00:13:03.408 --> 00:13:04.659
[MACHIKO]
There's no point.

00:13:04.701 --> 00:13:05.743
What?

00:13:05.785 --> 00:13:10.415
Stop. There's no
point to any of it.

00:13:10.456 --> 00:13:11.958
What do you mean?

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.547
[MACHIKO] Hey, bartender, we're
already dead now, aren't we?

00:13:17.588 --> 00:13:18.631
Yes.

00:13:18.673 --> 00:13:21.259
I'm afraid you have both
left the land of the living.

00:13:21.301 --> 00:13:23.594
Following their deaths,
people are either sent

00:13:23.636 --> 00:13:26.055
to Heaven or to Hell.

00:13:26.097 --> 00:13:27.724
People really go
to Heaven or Hell?

00:13:27.765 --> 00:13:29.100
Well, that's what
we tell them because

00:13:29.142 --> 00:13:31.519
it's an easy concept
to comprehend.

00:13:31.561 --> 00:13:34.897
More precisely, the options are
reincarnation and the void.

00:13:34.939 --> 00:13:37.859
Reincarnation and the void?

00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:39.694
[NONA] If reincarnated,
their soul will return

00:13:39.736 --> 00:13:42.196
to inhabit another
person's body.

00:13:42.238 --> 00:13:45.908
But if they are sent to the
void, then their soul is lost.

00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:48.703
and they plunge into darkness.

00:13:48.745 --> 00:13:50.371
[WOMAN]
That's what the judgment is for,

00:13:50.413 --> 00:13:52.457
to determine what
happens to their souls.

00:13:52.498 --> 00:13:56.127
[NONA] That's the heart
of what we arbiters do.

00:13:56.169 --> 00:13:59.464
Welcome to the
tribunal of the soul.

00:13:59.505 --> 00:14:02.550
[TAKASHI]
It's not my child!

00:14:02.592 --> 00:14:05.094
What? Whose do you
think it is, exactly?

00:14:05.136 --> 00:14:08.890
Somebody else's!
Please, it has to be!

00:14:10.266 --> 00:14:12.727
Takashi, please.

00:14:19.317 --> 00:14:21.069
[sighs]

00:14:25.573 --> 00:14:26.949
[MACHIKO sniffs]

00:14:26.991 --> 00:14:28.659
[TAKASHI]
I love you, Machiko.

00:14:28.701 --> 00:14:31.245
And I'll make you the
happiest woman alive.

00:14:31.287 --> 00:14:34.749
I promise that. Just
say you'll marry me.

00:14:36.376 --> 00:14:39.837
[MACHIKO]
Yes! Of course I'll marry you!

00:14:44.801 --> 00:14:47.595
You know, you're
actually right for once.

00:14:47.637 --> 00:14:48.304
[gasps]

00:14:48.346 --> 00:14:52.141
[MACHIKO] Yeah. I'm in love
with somebody else.

00:14:52.183 --> 00:14:57.397
[MACHIKO laughs]

00:14:57.438 --> 00:14:59.440
[MACHIKO]
I mean, it's obvious, isn't it?

00:14:59.482 --> 00:15:01.025
Did you actually think somebody

00:15:01.067 --> 00:15:02.443
would ever fall
in love with you?

00:15:02.485 --> 00:15:03.528
[grunts]

00:15:03.569 --> 00:15:05.405
What are you,
a complete idiot?

00:15:05.446 --> 00:15:07.949
I didn't want anything
but your money!

00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:10.076
[TAKASHI] Wait, you mean...
you were lying?

00:15:10.118 --> 00:15:12.370
You really were
making it all up?

00:15:12.412 --> 00:15:16.290
Of course I was lying,
moron! I mean, your child?

00:15:18.042 --> 00:15:21.963
[TAKASHI]
Dirty bitch! I'll teach you!

00:15:22.004 --> 00:15:25.341
Thank you for playing.
Best of luck on your journey.

00:15:35.893 --> 00:15:37.854
Not a bad job, there, Decim.

00:15:37.895 --> 00:15:40.898
[DECIM]
Thank you, I did my best.

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:42.984
What did you think about it?

00:15:44.402 --> 00:15:46.154
It was pretty awful.

00:15:47.196 --> 00:15:49.365
You will get used to it.

00:15:50.992 --> 00:15:53.077
So where did each of them
end up going, then?

00:15:53.119 --> 00:15:54.620
[NONA] I'm guessing
Takashi's soul was sent

00:15:54.662 --> 00:15:57.665
for reincarnation and Machiko's
was sent into the void.

00:15:57.707 --> 00:15:59.375
Yes.

00:15:59.417 --> 00:16:03.004
[WOMAN]
Oh, I see. Um.

00:16:03.045 --> 00:16:06.257
Maybe you can clear
something up for me.

00:16:11.179 --> 00:16:12.972
[WOMAN]
Basically, you think Machiko

00:16:13.014 --> 00:16:15.099
did have a man on the side.

00:16:15.141 --> 00:16:16.517
Yes.

00:16:16.559 --> 00:16:17.727
[WOMAN]
Hm.

00:16:17.768 --> 00:16:20.646
[NONA] It doesn't look like
you're convinced about that.

00:16:20.688 --> 00:16:21.939
No, not quite.

00:16:21.981 --> 00:16:25.067
I mean, it could have been
just a one-time thing, right?

00:16:29.113 --> 00:16:31.657
[MACHIKO sobs]

00:16:31.699 --> 00:16:35.536
It could, but what would
make you think that?

00:16:35.578 --> 00:16:37.330
A hunch.

00:16:38.456 --> 00:16:39.957
It's just a hunch?

00:16:39.999 --> 00:16:43.669
Something was bothering
her the whole time.

00:16:43.711 --> 00:16:45.046
We know she was pregnant.

00:16:45.087 --> 00:16:48.549
But who was the father?
I'd say Takashi.

00:16:48.591 --> 00:16:49.342
Really?

00:16:49.383 --> 00:16:51.928
But she said herself that it
belonged to somebody else.

00:16:51.969 --> 00:16:53.804
Yes, except, do you
remember her face

00:16:53.846 --> 00:16:54.972
when she said it?

00:16:55.014 --> 00:16:57.642
I'm pretty sure she
was actually lying.

00:16:57.683 --> 00:17:00.144
About the baby?
I don't understand.

00:17:00.186 --> 00:17:02.104
What would be the
reason to do that?

00:17:02.146 --> 00:17:03.981
The lie was a gift for Takashi.

00:17:04.023 --> 00:17:06.484
It was the only way remaining
that she could help him.

00:17:06.526 --> 00:17:09.111
What do you mean?
Help him how?

00:17:09.153 --> 00:17:10.988
He was tortured
by guilt and grief

00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:12.823
over killing his own child,

00:17:12.865 --> 00:17:15.159
but if the child
didn't belong to him,

00:17:15.201 --> 00:17:18.746
then maybe it wouldn't
hurt quite so much.

00:17:18.788 --> 00:17:20.039
[DECIM gasps]

00:17:22.833 --> 00:17:25.836
[DECIM] Her outburst...
It was all an act?

00:17:25.878 --> 00:17:28.005
That's my theory, yes.

00:17:31.008 --> 00:17:33.469
[DECIM]
That's incomprehensible. Why?

00:17:33.511 --> 00:17:36.472
Why do that when they
were already dead?

00:17:36.514 --> 00:17:38.140
I think it's because
they were dead.

00:17:38.182 --> 00:17:40.226
That changed things.

00:17:40.268 --> 00:17:42.520
[DECIM]
Hm?

00:17:42.562 --> 00:17:44.438
I'm only guessing about this.

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:46.440
But when she knew they
were about to be separated

00:17:46.482 --> 00:17:48.484
for good, maybe that was her way

00:17:48.526 --> 00:17:51.654
of being true to herself
and her feelings.

00:17:51.696 --> 00:17:53.489
You've lost me. What feelings?

00:17:53.531 --> 00:17:55.533
[WOMAN] Ugh. How are
you not getting this?

00:17:55.575 --> 00:17:57.743
Her feelings for Takashi!

00:17:59.537 --> 00:18:01.914
Oh, I see. You're
talking about love.

00:18:01.956 --> 00:18:03.374
[sighs]

00:18:04.834 --> 00:18:06.085
Then, most likely...

00:18:06.127 --> 00:18:08.254
[WOMAN 1B]
Yeah. You have to admit, though.

00:18:08.296 --> 00:18:09.255
Matchy really does...

00:18:09.297 --> 00:18:13.384
"Matchy"? Do they mean Machiko?

00:18:13.426 --> 00:18:15.344
If he hadn't gotten
the wrong idea,

00:18:15.386 --> 00:18:17.763
things would have
ended differently.

00:18:17.805 --> 00:18:21.142
They probably would've
had a happy life together.

00:18:21.183 --> 00:18:24.937
Do you think it's true?
Was my judgment incorrect?

00:18:24.979 --> 00:18:26.564
Huh?

00:18:26.606 --> 00:18:27.857
Heh.

00:18:29.233 --> 00:18:30.151
[grunts]

00:18:30.192 --> 00:18:31.944
Occasionally, we make mistakes.

00:18:31.986 --> 00:18:34.071
People can have
surprising motivations

00:18:34.113 --> 00:18:36.949
and unique ways of
expressing their emotions.

00:18:36.991 --> 00:18:39.827
As an arbiter, you can't
afford to brush things off.

00:18:39.869 --> 00:18:42.872
[DECIM]
Yes. I'm terribly sorry.

00:18:42.913 --> 00:18:44.373
[NONA]
Don't forget this.

00:18:44.415 --> 00:18:45.374
[DECIM]
Yes, ma'am.

00:18:45.416 --> 00:18:47.335
Good. Now, make me the usual.

00:18:47.376 --> 00:18:49.086
Yes, right away.

00:19:05.019 --> 00:19:06.520
So this is your usual drink?

00:19:06.562 --> 00:19:09.857
Give it a try.
They're very good.

00:19:09.899 --> 00:19:10.900
[laughs]

00:19:10.941 --> 00:19:13.361
Just as delicious as always!

00:19:17.448 --> 00:19:20.534
You weren't kidding!
This is good!

00:19:20.576 --> 00:19:22.703
Thank you. I'm glad
you enjoy it.

00:19:24.455 --> 00:19:27.458
That's all he's good for.
Drinks and seriousness.

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:29.752
There's not much to
Decim besides that.

00:19:29.794 --> 00:19:31.128
Well, there's the
mannequin hobby,

00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:33.255
but I don't think that's
something you forget.

00:19:33.297 --> 00:19:35.758
No, you really don't.

00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:38.469
[chuckles]

00:19:38.511 --> 00:19:41.013
Well, I trust you can
take it from here.

00:19:41.055 --> 00:19:43.432
Wait, I'm confused.
What do I do?

00:19:44.558 --> 00:19:48.938
[NONA] Hmm, well, just
what you've been doing.

00:19:56.487 --> 00:19:57.947
So, how did she do?

00:19:57.988 --> 00:19:59.699
Not a bad showing,
I would say.

00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:01.450
Huh?

00:20:01.492 --> 00:20:03.994
What is it?

00:20:04.036 --> 00:20:05.204
It's just that
you're not usually

00:20:05.246 --> 00:20:07.665
so positive about them.

00:20:07.707 --> 00:20:08.916
[NONA]
Hm.

00:20:10.751 --> 00:20:13.671
[NONA]
A happy life, huh?

00:20:13.713 --> 00:20:16.590
"Matchy"? Do they mean Machiko?

00:20:16.632 --> 00:20:19.593
[NONA] That wasn't just a
simple misunderstanding.

00:20:23.848 --> 00:20:26.142
[NONA]
It was more than that.

00:20:26.183 --> 00:20:29.353
Takashi was a person who
couldn't trust anybody.

00:20:29.395 --> 00:20:32.231
I don't see how he could
ever have found happiness.

00:20:35.401 --> 00:20:38.237
[NONA] Actually...
I take back what I said.

00:20:38.279 --> 00:20:39.989
What?

00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:42.533
She still has a way to go, yet.

00:20:45.161 --> 00:20:46.245
[DECIM]
You're very insightful.

00:20:46.287 --> 00:20:48.122
I look forward to
working together.

00:20:48.164 --> 00:20:49.749
[WOMAN]
Thanks. I do, too.

00:20:49.790 --> 00:20:52.835
And also. I'd like to
apologize for earlier.

00:20:52.877 --> 00:20:53.961
Why?

00:20:54.003 --> 00:20:55.045
I made a mistake.

00:20:55.087 --> 00:20:58.215
I have respect for people who
have lived a fulfilling life.

00:20:58.257 --> 00:21:02.178
In this instance, I did not
act as befitted an arbiter.

00:21:04.847 --> 00:21:08.100
Hey, Decim. One more thing.

00:21:08.142 --> 00:21:09.769
Yes, what is it?

00:21:10.936 --> 00:21:12.021
[WOMAN]
I'm empty.

00:21:12.062 --> 00:21:14.190
Think you could
make me another one?

00:21:15.608 --> 00:21:17.485
It would be my pleasure.

00:22:37.439 --> 00:22:39.275
[NONA]
Yes. I see.

00:22:39.316 --> 00:22:41.485
Excellent. Thank you very much.

00:22:41.527 --> 00:22:43.779
[NONA]
Yes, don't worry. I get it.

00:22:43.821 --> 00:22:46.156
The term is only
for three months.

00:23:14.643 --> 00:23:17.688
