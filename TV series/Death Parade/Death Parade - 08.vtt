Hm?

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.322
[DECIM]
This is odd.

00:00:30.364 --> 00:00:31.740
What is it?

00:00:31.782 --> 00:00:33.700
If you can wait for
just a moment, please.

00:00:33.742 --> 00:00:35.827
I must verify this.

[phone ringing]

00:00:42.125 --> 00:00:43.585
Nona here.

00:00:43.627 --> 00:00:45.128
Ma'am, it appears we
have a guest arriving

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.172
in the bar shortly who
has killed someone.

00:00:47.214 --> 00:00:50.133
[WOMAN gasps]
What?

00:00:50.175 --> 00:00:52.511
[NONA] Oh, yeah? Well,
you'll have to handle it.

00:00:52.553 --> 00:00:54.846
The others are up
to their eyeballs.

00:00:54.888 --> 00:00:57.724
[DECIM] But, ma'am, I have
no experience with this.

00:00:57.766 --> 00:01:00.769
[NONA] Don't over-think it.
Killers are still people, right?

00:01:00.811 --> 00:01:03.146
I'm sure it'll be
pretty standard.

00:01:04.731 --> 00:01:06.066
As you say, ma'am.

00:01:06.108 --> 00:01:08.944
Yes. Yes, I understand.

00:01:10.445 --> 00:01:12.239
We're doing this?

00:01:12.281 --> 00:01:15.659
[DECIM] Yes. She said the
others are all occupied.

[WOMAN]
So, which one is it?

00:01:36.722 --> 00:01:38.807
[DECIM]
Which one is what?

00:01:38.849 --> 00:01:41.351
One of them is a
murderer, right?

00:01:41.393 --> 00:01:43.312
[DECIM]
It seems they have arrived.

00:03:23.745 --> 00:03:25.539
[DECIM]
Right this way, please.

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.791
Have a seat, and
welcome to Quindecim.

00:03:27.833 --> 00:03:30.585
My name is Decim, and I
will be your bartender.

00:03:30.627 --> 00:03:32.421
Hi. Nice to meet ya.

00:03:32.462 --> 00:03:35.340
Now then, you may find
this a strange question,

00:03:35.382 --> 00:03:38.260
but I'm afraid that
I do have to ask it.

00:03:38.301 --> 00:03:39.386
Do you remember anything

00:03:39.428 --> 00:03:41.972
from just prior to
your arrival here?

00:03:42.013 --> 00:03:45.809
Huh... Well, actually,
now that you mention it.

00:03:45.851 --> 00:03:48.895
I don't remember
much of anything.

00:03:48.937 --> 00:03:51.898
I'm pretty sure I was
on my way somewhere.

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.859
But that's really about it.

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:57.571
Thank you for indulging me.

00:03:57.612 --> 00:04:00.866
And if I may ask you the same?

00:04:00.907 --> 00:04:03.160
Let me think.

00:04:03.201 --> 00:04:06.037
It seems I was headed
someplace, as well.

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:08.165
But I don't remember where.

00:04:09.291 --> 00:04:11.668
Very good. Thank you
for answering.

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:14.504
[TATSUMI] Never mind that.
What is this place?

00:04:14.546 --> 00:04:15.422
All right.

00:04:15.464 --> 00:04:17.215
I will now explain a
number of things about

00:04:17.257 --> 00:04:19.301
your current situation.

00:04:19.342 --> 00:04:23.388
This is rather important, so
please do pay close attention.

00:04:25.766 --> 00:04:28.518
We're supposed to risk
our lives on a game?

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.479
Why don't we split up
and look for an exit?

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.565
[SHIMADA] Sounds good. I'll
start in that direction, okay?

00:04:33.607 --> 00:04:35.108
Go for it.

00:04:39.446 --> 00:04:42.115
No good. It's just a bathroom.

[SHIMADA gasps]

00:05:10.685 --> 00:05:14.815
Shit! A bloody knife?
Why's that in there?

Uh, yes?

Oh, you taking
a leak? I'm sorry.

00:05:21.905 --> 00:05:23.532
[SHIMADA]
Oh, no!

00:05:23.573 --> 00:05:27.035
I mean, I'm done here.
It's no problem.

00:05:27.077 --> 00:05:29.704
Well, I struck out.
How 'bout you?

00:05:29.746 --> 00:05:31.414
[SHIMADA]
No luck here.

00:05:33.291 --> 00:05:35.710
[TATSUMI] There really aren't
any exits, are there?

00:05:35.752 --> 00:05:36.461
No.

00:05:36.503 --> 00:05:39.047
As I tried to explain, you will
not be able to leave here

00:05:39.089 --> 00:05:41.258
until the game is completed.

00:05:41.299 --> 00:05:42.384
You sure about that?

00:05:42.425 --> 00:05:44.594
Do you really wanna screw
around with a detective?

00:05:44.636 --> 00:05:45.428
What?

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:47.180
[TATSUMI]
This is false imprisonment.

00:05:47.222 --> 00:05:49.808
Section 2-20 of
the criminal code.

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:53.186
Keeping us here like this
is illegal, pal. You get that?

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:56.731
[TATSUMI]
Got nothin' to say, huh?

00:05:56.773 --> 00:05:59.067
What if we don't play your game?

00:05:59.109 --> 00:06:01.736
I would sincerely
recommend that you do.

00:06:01.778 --> 00:06:03.113

[TATSUMI] If we don't play
the game, we end up like that?

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:19.087
I'm terribly sorry
for being vague.

00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:22.299
But I'm afraid I cannot
say more than I have.

00:06:27.178 --> 00:06:29.514
Well, kid? What do ya think?

00:06:29.556 --> 00:06:32.642
[SHIMADA]
What, me? I-I'm really scared.

00:06:32.684 --> 00:06:35.896
Where are we? Are those
people murderers?

00:06:35.937 --> 00:06:37.188
[TATSUMI]
No, I don't think so.

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:37.939
What?

00:06:37.981 --> 00:06:40.317
[TATSUMI] Just call it
an occupational hazard.

00:06:40.358 --> 00:06:42.193
When I look a guy in the eyes,

00:06:42.235 --> 00:06:45.572
I can usually judge
what kinda person he is.

00:06:45.614 --> 00:06:47.699
His aren't the eyes of a killer,

00:06:47.741 --> 00:06:50.785
but they don't look like
the eyes of a liar, either.

00:06:50.827 --> 00:06:53.330
[SHIMADA] Oh, good. I mean,
that's a relief, right?

00:06:53.371 --> 00:06:53.955
[TATSUMI]
Hm?

00:06:53.997 --> 00:06:57.208
Glad you're here, detective.
It's reassuring, you know?

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:59.252
Ah, knock off the
"detective" business.

00:06:59.294 --> 00:07:01.296
You can just call me Tatsumi.

00:07:01.338 --> 00:07:04.466
[SHIMADA] Okay, Tatsumi it is,
and my name is Shimada,

00:07:04.507 --> 00:07:05.342
by the way.

00:07:05.383 --> 00:07:07.093
Okay.

00:07:09.012 --> 00:07:12.390
Well, Shimada, think you
could work with me?

00:07:12.432 --> 00:07:13.975
Huh?

00:07:15.018 --> 00:07:17.187
[WOMAN] If I could have you
press this button, please.

00:07:17.228 --> 00:07:19.147
The roulette will begin.

00:07:20.982 --> 00:07:22.817
We'll play your
screwed up little game,

00:07:22.859 --> 00:07:24.861
but you should know,
this won't be the last time

00:07:24.903 --> 00:07:26.821
you're gonna hear from me.

00:07:26.863 --> 00:07:28.990
Yes, sir. Understood.

00:07:36.915 --> 00:07:38.917
[game music plays]

00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:01.481
[WOMAN] The rules are
the same as they are

00:08:01.523 --> 00:08:02.983
for regular air hockey.

00:08:03.024 --> 00:08:05.485
You'll use the paddles to
hit the puck back and forth,

00:08:05.527 --> 00:08:08.279
trying to score on the
other player's goal.

00:08:08.321 --> 00:08:12.158
For each goal that you score,
you will win one point.

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:14.577
Whoever reaches a total
of six points first

00:08:14.619 --> 00:08:17.038
will be declared the
winner of the game.

00:08:19.165 --> 00:08:22.335
[WOMAN] However. The pucks
are a little unusual.

00:08:22.377 --> 00:08:24.254
They are inscribed
with various images,

00:08:24.295 --> 00:08:26.673
corresponding to your
respective bodies.

00:08:26.715 --> 00:08:30.218
Ugh! What the hell was that?

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.178
[WOMAN]
The red pucks are for Shimada,

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:34.305
while the blue pucks
are for Tatsumi.

00:08:34.347 --> 00:08:37.434
Attempt to score using
a puck of your own color.

00:08:37.475 --> 00:08:40.186
If you do, you will
earn double points.

00:08:41.271 --> 00:08:44.024
[WOMAN] Conversely, if your
goal is scored upon,

00:08:44.065 --> 00:08:46.985
then you will lose one point.

00:08:47.027 --> 00:08:48.194
Very well, then.

00:08:48.236 --> 00:08:50.697
If you're ready, the
game will now begin.

00:09:04.586 --> 00:09:08.173
[sighs] Here goes nothing.

00:09:08.214 --> 00:09:09.466

Yep.

00:09:19.559 --> 00:09:21.269
Two for you.

00:09:27.025 --> 00:09:29.444
[TATSUMI]
All right. My turn now.

00:09:38.745 --> 00:09:40.789
[gasps]

[SAE sobbing]

00:09:47.462 --> 00:09:49.839
It's okay. Don't cry, Sae.

00:09:49.881 --> 00:09:51.049
You still have me.

00:09:51.091 --> 00:09:53.885
I'll look out for you now
that Mom and Dad can't.

00:09:53.927 --> 00:09:55.303
[SAE]
But...

00:09:58.223 --> 00:09:59.808
I will protect you.

00:09:59.849 --> 00:10:02.352
I promise, whatever it takes.

00:10:05.021 --> 00:10:05.939
[TATSUMI]
Somthin' wrong?

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:09.943
Huh? Oh, nothing. Just
thinking about old times.

00:10:09.984 --> 00:10:10.985
Hmm?

00:10:11.027 --> 00:10:13.029
[SHIMADA] I remembered that
my sister and I played this

00:10:13.071 --> 00:10:14.823
a long time ago.

00:10:14.864 --> 00:10:16.866
We lost our parents when
we were pretty young.

00:10:16.908 --> 00:10:18.368
Money was always tight.

00:10:18.409 --> 00:10:21.663
So we tried to drag out the
game by keeping a rally going.

00:10:21.704 --> 00:10:22.580
[TATSUMI]
Oh?

00:10:22.622 --> 00:10:26.543
Unfortunately, the time
ran out on us. That's right.

00:10:26.584 --> 00:10:29.129
We didn't know the thing
had a time limit on it.

00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:31.673
Not exactly a good surprise.

00:10:31.714 --> 00:10:34.050
My sister was inconsolable.

00:10:34.092 --> 00:10:37.178
It took me forever to
get her to stop crying.

00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:39.305
What about now? You still play?

00:10:39.347 --> 00:10:40.140
No, we don't.

00:10:40.181 --> 00:10:42.725
My sister is actually
in high school now,

00:10:42.767 --> 00:10:45.937
and since I started
working, I'm so busy.

00:10:48.314 --> 00:10:50.608
[TATSUMI]
How old are you, Shimada?

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:52.110
I'm 22 now.

00:10:52.152 --> 00:10:56.114
I started working right after
I graduated from high school.

00:10:56.156 --> 00:11:00.076
I get it. Sounds like you
put your sister first.

00:11:05.415 --> 00:11:09.419
Pardon me, are you
perhaps not feeling well?

00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:11.838
It's not that.

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:15.091
It's the remote. I don't
want you to use it.

00:11:15.133 --> 00:11:16.426
I know that it bothers you.

00:11:16.467 --> 00:11:19.387
As it happens, it's actually
broken at the moment.

00:11:21.848 --> 00:11:23.266
[DECIM] Are you especially
worried this time

00:11:23.308 --> 00:11:25.602
because of the killing?

00:11:25.643 --> 00:11:27.020
Just imagine what could happen.

00:11:27.061 --> 00:11:29.147
Things get out of hand
even when normal people

00:11:29.189 --> 00:11:30.648
go through this.

00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:33.818
Maybe, but killers
are still people.

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:38.031
How are you supposed to
make a legitimate judgment?

00:11:38.072 --> 00:11:39.824
Killer or innocent,
there is no one

00:11:39.866 --> 00:11:41.326
who cannot be judged.

00:11:41.367 --> 00:11:44.871
Whatever happens,
I will judge them.

00:12:03.431 --> 00:12:04.766
[sighs]

00:12:05.934 --> 00:12:09.395
It's one wacky thing after
another in this place, isn't it?

00:12:09.437 --> 00:12:11.272
I wish I knew what the
deal was with this game.

00:12:11.314 --> 00:12:13.358
[SHIMADA]
Huh? You don't know anything?

00:12:13.399 --> 00:12:17.403
When you asked me to
cooperate, I assumed you did.

00:12:17.445 --> 00:12:19.989
How can I explain this to you?

00:12:20.031 --> 00:12:21.032
Tell me something.

00:12:21.074 --> 00:12:23.451
What do you think's the
hardest part about what I do?

00:12:23.493 --> 00:12:25.161
Uh... I don't know.

00:12:25.203 --> 00:12:28.331
The long hours?
Or somethin' like that.

00:12:28.373 --> 00:12:30.708
[TATSUMI] It's not the
time or physical stress.

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:33.586
The cases my division handles
are the serious ones.

00:12:33.628 --> 00:12:37.048
We see some real heavy
emotions on a daily basis.

00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:40.510
Real heavy emotions,
huh? Like what?

00:12:40.551 --> 00:12:42.262
Well, for example,
there's the grief

00:12:42.303 --> 00:12:44.264
of the victim's family
after their loved one

00:12:44.305 --> 00:12:46.766
has been murdered.
That's always rough.

00:12:46.808 --> 00:12:49.394
I'm telling ya, it takes
a lot out of you to confront

00:12:49.435 --> 00:12:52.605
that kind of emotion.

00:12:52.647 --> 00:12:54.440
Earlier, I talked
about judging people

00:12:54.482 --> 00:12:57.902
by their eyes, but something
is off about that guy.

00:12:57.944 --> 00:13:01.906
As far as I can tell,
he doesn't feel anything.

00:13:01.948 --> 00:13:03.783
I've never met anybody
like that before,

00:13:03.825 --> 00:13:06.744
to be honest.
Can't figure him out.

00:13:08.579 --> 00:13:10.498
All right, kid.
Back to the game.

00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:15.211
Wait! Can you explain something?
Why are we even playing at all?

00:13:15.253 --> 00:13:16.254
'Cause if we keep going,

00:13:16.296 --> 00:13:18.464
we might actually
find something out.

00:13:18.506 --> 00:13:20.049
Something like what?

00:13:20.091 --> 00:13:23.219
[TATSUMI] About the game,
maybe. About the guy.

00:13:23.261 --> 00:13:25.388
But I'm not interested in that.

00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:28.099
Not in the game,
or the white-haired guy.

00:13:28.141 --> 00:13:30.018
I said that I would cooperate

00:13:30.059 --> 00:13:33.646
because I thought you were
gonna get us outta here.

00:13:33.688 --> 00:13:35.273
Yeah. I get it.

00:13:35.315 --> 00:13:38.776
Just hang in there a
little longer for me.

00:13:38.818 --> 00:13:40.320
I'm not like you, though.

00:13:40.361 --> 00:13:43.156
You don't seem to get
frightened by anything.

00:13:43.197 --> 00:13:44.741
[TATSUMI]
I get scared sometimes.

00:13:44.782 --> 00:13:48.328
But right now, it doesn't matter
whether we're afraid or not.

00:13:48.369 --> 00:13:50.663
Till we end this game,
one way or another,

00:13:50.705 --> 00:13:54.375
we're not gettin' out
of this damn place.

00:13:54.417 --> 00:13:56.878
[SHIMADA]
Fine. Let's do it.

00:14:06.554 --> 00:14:08.139
[SHIMADA]
Congratulations.

00:14:08.181 --> 00:14:11.100
[SAE] That means a lot
from my big brother.

00:14:12.602 --> 00:14:15.355
Look at you. You sure
have grown up, huh?

00:14:15.396 --> 00:14:19.150

crying on me!

00:14:20.693 --> 00:14:23.571
I promise, I'll do my best.

No, how could I have forgotten

00:15:21.587 --> 00:15:24.715
something like... that?

00:15:24.757 --> 00:15:27.343
You're so pale. What's wrong?

00:15:31.722 --> 00:15:33.474
Hey! Tatsumi?

00:15:34.851 --> 00:15:39.021
[TATSUMI] I have a headache.
Give me a sec, okay?

00:15:39.063 --> 00:15:40.022
[DECIM]
They're going more slowly

00:15:40.064 --> 00:15:41.649
than I thought they would.

00:15:41.691 --> 00:15:42.650
What?

00:15:42.692 --> 00:15:45.027
Maybe the shock from
their deaths is greater.

00:15:45.069 --> 00:15:46.988
Their memories seem
to be buried more deeply

00:15:47.029 --> 00:15:48.531
than other guests'.

00:15:48.573 --> 00:15:50.158
And we can't tamper
with what memories

00:15:50.199 --> 00:15:52.326
they do recall, can we?

00:15:52.368 --> 00:15:53.953
So, what are you going to do?

00:15:53.995 --> 00:15:56.414
[DECIM]
Hm.

00:15:56.456 --> 00:15:59.292
[WOMAN]
You could let me see them.

00:15:59.333 --> 00:16:01.711
The guests' memories, I mean.

00:16:04.297 --> 00:16:06.966
I'll put in a request
about that later.

Here you go, honey.

What's that?

00:16:20.855 --> 00:16:23.691
You are a stereotypical
detective, aren't you?

00:16:23.733 --> 00:16:25.902
[YUMI chuckles]
My poor husband!

00:16:25.943 --> 00:16:29.614
So busy, you can't even
remember your own birthday.

00:16:29.655 --> 00:16:32.200
Oh, yeah. That's right.

00:16:34.452 --> 00:16:36.787
Gift first. Cigarette later.

00:16:39.707 --> 00:16:41.834
Yours practically had
holes in the bottom.

00:16:41.876 --> 00:16:44.212
I thought you could
use a new pair.

00:16:48.841 --> 00:16:52.553
[TATSUMI]
That's right. She was killed.

00:16:52.595 --> 00:16:54.972
My wife was murdered.

[DETECTIVE 8A]
What's Tatsumi doing?

00:17:02.063 --> 00:17:04.273
I thought they pulled him
from the investigation.

00:17:04.315 --> 00:17:06.567
[DETECTIVE 8B] I hear he
hasn't even taken a day off.

00:17:06.609 --> 00:17:07.818
[DETECTIVE 8C]
They should really move him

00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:10.029
out of the division.
I can't bear to watch this.

00:17:10.071 --> 00:17:11.322

He likes a repeat offender

out on parole for it.
