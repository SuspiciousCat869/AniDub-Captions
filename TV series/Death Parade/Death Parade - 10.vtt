[DECIM grunts]

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.479
Where am I?

00:00:23.232 --> 00:00:24.900
Who am I?

00:00:24.942 --> 00:00:26.818
For the moment,
you don't have a name,

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.821
but I can tell you
that you are an arbiter.

00:00:29.863 --> 00:00:31.323
What do you mean by "arbiter"?

00:00:31.365 --> 00:00:33.951
An arbiter is someone who
judges people's souls

00:00:33.992 --> 00:00:37.162
and sends them either for
reincarnation or into the void.

00:00:37.204 --> 00:00:40.958
I'm to act as a
judge assessing souls?

00:00:40.999 --> 00:00:42.960
The souls of humans?

00:00:44.753 --> 00:00:47.089
An arbiter of souls.

00:02:13.342 --> 00:02:16.345
[NONA]
Number One: Arbiters cannot stop

00:02:16.386 --> 00:02:19.640
making judgments, for this
task is more than their job.

00:02:19.681 --> 00:02:22.726
It is the entire reason
for their existence.

00:02:24.478 --> 00:02:27.898
Number Two: Arbiters
cannot experience death,

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:30.233
for that would taint
their judgments.

00:02:30.275 --> 00:02:33.236
It would make them too
close to being human.

00:02:33.278 --> 00:02:36.698
Number Three: Arbiters
cannot feel emotions,

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.534
for doing so is not
in their natures.

00:02:39.576 --> 00:02:42.913
It is impossible for a
dummy to have feelings.

00:02:46.166 --> 00:02:48.502
Out with it. What are
you doing here?

00:02:52.756 --> 00:02:56.218
Whatever you wanna call it,
this isn't judgment!

00:02:58.345 --> 00:03:00.013
[DECIM] I have come to believe
that the way in which

00:03:00.055 --> 00:03:03.183
we arrive at our judgments
is fundamentally flawed.

00:03:03.225 --> 00:03:04.935
[NONA]
Is it? How so?

00:03:04.976 --> 00:03:06.895
The method that we employ:

00:03:06.937 --> 00:03:08.897
using extreme conditions
in order to reveal

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:11.274
the darkness within the soul.

00:03:11.316 --> 00:03:13.360
What if we are creating
that darkness rather than

00:03:13.402 --> 00:03:14.403
just uncovering it?

00:03:14.444 --> 00:03:16.071
[NONA grunts]

00:03:16.113 --> 00:03:18.281
I'm sorry, ma'am,
but I have true respect

00:03:18.323 --> 00:03:20.575
for people who have
lived a fulfilling life.

00:03:20.617 --> 00:03:22.994
So, I cannot judge them.

00:03:25.956 --> 00:03:29.459
[NONA] I see. So, what
are we to do about her?

00:03:33.588 --> 00:03:35.090
[grunts]

00:03:40.887 --> 00:03:42.222
[gasps]

00:03:42.264 --> 00:03:47.227
[NONA] Decim. Her term
is coming to an end.

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:48.603
The time has passed quickly.

00:03:48.645 --> 00:03:50.564
[NONA] Do you think you
can judge her now?

00:03:50.605 --> 00:03:53.525
Perhaps it would be easier
for you if I did it.

00:03:53.567 --> 00:03:55.026
No, ma'am, but thank you.

00:03:55.068 --> 00:03:56.361
[NONA]
Very well.

00:03:56.403 --> 00:03:58.488
Then you judge her
and make the decision.

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.700
Will she be reincarnated or...

00:04:01.742 --> 00:04:05.620
...will she be cast out
into the void?

00:04:05.662 --> 00:04:08.457
However, creating the
right conditions--

00:04:08.498 --> 00:04:10.709
What all do you know about
her? Is it insufficient?

00:04:10.751 --> 00:04:13.712
If I'm correct, most of her
memories were erased.

00:04:13.754 --> 00:04:15.464
They were.

00:04:15.505 --> 00:04:18.800
Shall I have Quin send along
her compilation for you?

00:04:18.842 --> 00:04:21.011
No. I should be all right.

00:04:21.052 --> 00:04:22.763
Given your new doubts,
will you judge her

00:04:22.804 --> 00:04:25.140
without seeing the
darkness within her soul?

00:04:25.182 --> 00:04:27.642
In all honesty. I don't
think her true nature--

00:04:27.684 --> 00:04:29.394
You really think you
know her true nature?

00:04:29.436 --> 00:04:31.980
Even if you did, you might not
be able to understand it.

00:04:36.651 --> 00:04:39.029
I'm going to send you
a special guest.

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:41.448
Whatever you do, judge her.

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.201
You are still an
arbiter, are you not?

00:04:47.871 --> 00:04:49.581

Hm?

00:04:51.041 --> 00:04:54.753
[DECIM] Pardon me. A guest
will be arriving shortly.

Could you handle it?

[gasps]

00:05:02.552 --> 00:05:04.763
[DECIM] I can tell that
you are out of sorts.

00:05:04.805 --> 00:05:07.599
You have become aware
that you are human?

00:05:12.938 --> 00:05:14.439
There is something
else you should know.

00:05:14.481 --> 00:05:17.275
Human souls cannot remain here.

00:05:17.317 --> 00:05:19.444
If they should exceed
the period of judgment,

00:05:19.486 --> 00:05:22.906
they become dummies,
like those you've seen.

00:05:22.948 --> 00:05:25.158
The time has come.

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.578
I cannot wait any
longer to judge you.

00:05:29.871 --> 00:05:33.834
Still judging. After all that's
happened, nothing's changed?

00:05:33.875 --> 00:05:37.295
I am an arbiter. What
other choice do I have?

00:05:50.976 --> 00:05:52.978

What will you do to judge me?

00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:54.271

Nor do I have any idea which
game is going to be selected.

Welcome to Quindecim.
Please have a seat.

00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:22.340
[SACHIKO] You're saying
that I can't leave here

00:06:24.384 --> 00:06:26.720
Correct. I'm terribly sorry.

nothing else to do.

[SACHIKO] Two isn't enough
for Old Maid, after all.

00:07:34.579 --> 00:07:36.831
[DECIM] First, if you will
please remove any pairs of cards

00:07:36.873 --> 00:07:39.334
from your hand and lay
them down on the table.

Whoever is holding the joker
at the end of the game

00:07:41.378 --> 00:07:42.921
is the loser.

00:07:42.963 --> 00:07:44.839
[SACHIKO] And these are just
regular playing cards

00:07:44.881 --> 00:07:45.548

a bit different than normal.

Well, you wouldn't
know it, as my drawings

This is one of my characters.

[DECIM] The designs on these
cards are, in fact, relevant.

They show scenes that
relate to the players.

By dealing them, I have
distributed them about.

I haven't played cards

00:09:54.427 --> 00:09:56.763
What do you mean
"The point of judging"?

00:09:56.805 --> 00:09:59.599
[DECIM] Well. What is the
purpose of what we do?

Why is it that
we pass judgments?

What the hell are
you talking about?

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:07.148
Are you a freaking idiot, man?

00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:08.817
There isn't a point.

00:10:08.858 --> 00:10:11.111
We're here to judge,
so we judge.

00:10:11.152 --> 00:10:15.615
That's all! Finis!
The End! You get it now?

00:10:15.657 --> 00:10:17.408
But is that a good
enough reason, though?

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:19.619
[GINTI]
It's not good, and it's not bad.

00:10:19.661 --> 00:10:22.956
All there is, is the
outcome of the judgments.

00:10:22.997 --> 00:10:27.460
Quit snoring!
You sound like a cow!

00:10:27.502 --> 00:10:30.421
What's with you? You're
acting like a human.

00:10:30.463 --> 00:10:32.257
Humans think dying's
something that happens

00:10:32.298 --> 00:10:35.301
to someone else. So,
at the moment of death,

00:10:35.343 --> 00:10:38.429
they start desperately
looking for meaning.

00:10:38.471 --> 00:10:41.224
But there is no
meaning to living.

00:10:41.266 --> 00:10:44.102
The fact of the matter is,
they live in order to die.

00:10:44.144 --> 00:10:47.147
So stop thinking about
the meaning of life,

00:10:47.188 --> 00:10:49.274
or of your judgments!

00:10:52.735 --> 00:10:53.695

Oh, that's all well and good.

is draw on all of his judgments.

00:11:57.967 --> 00:12:01.095
they were condensed and
compiled. Give me all of them.

00:12:01.137 --> 00:12:02.305
Huh?

00:12:03.556 --> 00:12:06.142
[SACHIKO]
Ooh! Another pair for me!

00:12:11.981 --> 00:12:13.233
Huh?

00:12:20.365 --> 00:12:23.576
My, it's almost
like magic, isn't it?

00:12:23.618 --> 00:12:26.579
I'm sorry. Is
something the matter?

00:12:26.621 --> 00:12:28.998
No, don't trouble yourself.

00:12:30.375 --> 00:12:32.293
Looks like my victory, eh?

00:12:32.335 --> 00:12:35.421
Congratulations on the win.

00:12:35.463 --> 00:12:38.174
Thank you very much, dear.

00:12:38.216 --> 00:12:39.592
[DECIM]
Hm?

00:12:39.634 --> 00:12:41.135
[SACHIKO]
I'm going to ask you a question,

00:12:41.177 --> 00:12:44.305
and I want the truth,
all right? Be honest, now.

00:12:44.347 --> 00:12:45.682
Is this the afterlife?

00:12:45.723 --> 00:12:46.683
Oh--

00:12:46.724 --> 00:12:48.059
[gasps]

00:12:49.727 --> 00:12:51.020
Yes.

00:12:51.062 --> 00:12:52.021
I thought as much.

00:12:52.063 --> 00:12:53.064
[WOMAN]
What are you doing?

00:12:53.106 --> 00:12:54.399
It does not matter.

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:55.650
Huh?

00:12:55.692 --> 00:12:59.737
To summarize, following death,
people's souls arrive here.

00:12:59.779 --> 00:13:02.156
It is my job to pass
judgment upon them.

00:13:02.198 --> 00:13:03.866
I am what's called an arbiter.

00:13:03.908 --> 00:13:06.119
Ah.

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:09.122
[DECIM] When did you first
realize this was the afterlife?

00:13:09.163 --> 00:13:12.959
Only a moment ago.
Do you see this boy here?

00:13:13.001 --> 00:13:15.336
His name is Miu,
but this drawing of him

00:13:15.378 --> 00:13:16.879
doesn't actually exist.

00:13:16.921 --> 00:13:18.089
[DECIM, WOMAN gasp]

00:13:18.131 --> 00:13:20.425
[SACHIKO] He was going to
appear in my next feature,

00:13:20.466 --> 00:13:22.427
but I haven't drawn him yet.

00:13:22.468 --> 00:13:25.513
As a character, he
exists only in my mind.

00:13:25.555 --> 00:13:31.144
But here he is, just as I
imagined him! What a surprise!

00:13:31.185 --> 00:13:32.854
That's what tipped me off.

00:13:32.895 --> 00:13:36.065
This couldn't possibly be
the world I've always known.

00:13:36.107 --> 00:13:39.068
Sorry, but you don't
seem very troubled.

00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:41.154
I might feel different
about the whole situation

00:13:41.195 --> 00:13:42.780
if I could remember dying.

00:13:42.822 --> 00:13:46.075
[laughs] Ah, the joys
of getting old!

00:13:46.117 --> 00:13:48.244
No one who comes
here remembers dying.

00:13:48.286 --> 00:13:50.705
It has nothing to do
with your age.

00:13:50.747 --> 00:13:52.915
If you'd like to know how
you passed, I could tell you.

00:13:52.957 --> 00:13:53.916
[SACHIKO]
That's okay.

00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:55.043
Huh?

00:13:55.084 --> 00:13:58.629
To be honest, I suspect
I'm better off not knowing.

00:13:58.671 --> 00:14:00.048
Thank you for this, though.

00:14:00.089 --> 00:14:02.842
My time in this place has
been like a wonderful dream.

00:14:02.884 --> 00:14:06.679
[gasps] Oh, really? Playing
the game, you mean?

00:14:06.721 --> 00:14:09.390
Yes, dear, that's right.

00:14:09.432 --> 00:14:11.851
My husband and I weren't
able to start a family

00:14:11.893 --> 00:14:14.562
of our own. So the
characters I created

00:14:14.604 --> 00:14:16.397
became like my children.

00:14:16.439 --> 00:14:19.567
I never imagined I would
see them again like this.

00:14:19.609 --> 00:14:22.403
It's been a delightful surprise.

00:14:22.445 --> 00:14:25.198
My work wasn't always
easy, but I'm glad

00:14:25.239 --> 00:14:27.158
I got the chance
to come face-to-face

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:29.702
with my illustrations.

00:14:29.744 --> 00:14:33.289
So, you see, I'm happy I
played that game of yours.

00:14:35.458 --> 00:14:37.835
It may be over now,
but at least I know

00:14:37.877 --> 00:14:40.630
that I lived a full life.

00:14:40.671 --> 00:14:43.800
That is a wonderful
thing to hear.

00:14:43.841 --> 00:14:45.718
A full life.

00:14:47.762 --> 00:14:50.306
Shall we continue on
with the game, then?

00:14:52.392 --> 00:14:54.018
Ugh!

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:56.396
What are you gonna do
with her memories, anyway?

00:14:56.437 --> 00:14:57.980
[NONA]
Just get them, okay?

00:14:58.022 --> 00:15:00.316
[QUIN] It's not like
I'm made of time, here.

00:15:00.358 --> 00:15:03.361
Do you know how many
people die every second?

00:15:06.239 --> 00:15:07.949
Seems like there's
a lot in here.

00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:11.369
[QUIN] Actually, it's not that
much. She died pretty early.

00:15:11.411 --> 00:15:13.871
Don't concern yourself with
arbiter memory capacity

00:15:13.913 --> 00:15:17.083
this time around. I want
you to recompile these.

00:15:17.125 --> 00:15:19.710
Uh...

00:15:19.752 --> 00:15:20.837
Here, for your trouble.

00:15:20.878 --> 00:15:22.713
Uh-- Ah!

00:15:22.755 --> 00:15:24.048
Ha!

00:15:44.777 --> 00:15:46.070
[gasps]

00:15:50.450 --> 00:15:53.744
[SACHIKO] Oh, my. I
recognize those drawings.

00:15:53.786 --> 00:15:55.705
That one's Chavvot, isn't it?

00:15:55.746 --> 00:15:56.581
[DECIM]
Chavvot?

00:15:56.622 --> 00:15:58.916
[SACHIKO] Yes, it's the name
of a little girl character

00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:00.668
in the children's
book, "Chavvot."

00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:03.171
By any chance, was that
one of your works?

00:16:03.212 --> 00:16:04.547
No, not mine.

00:16:04.589 --> 00:16:08.426
I've just read the book
before, that's all.

00:16:08.468 --> 00:16:10.761
Can you tell us what
the story is about?

00:16:10.803 --> 00:16:13.139
[SACHIKO]
Well, let me see.

00:16:13.181 --> 00:16:15.766
It's about this little
boy named Jimmy

00:16:15.808 --> 00:16:17.894
who falls in love with Chavvot.

00:16:17.935 --> 00:16:21.772
But he can't tell her because
she's unable to hear.

00:16:21.814 --> 00:16:23.983
So Jimmy wishes on a star.

00:16:24.025 --> 00:16:26.486
He asks that someday,
Chavvot will know

00:16:26.527 --> 00:16:28.821
how he feels about her.

00:16:28.863 --> 00:16:29.989
Intriguing.

00:16:30.031 --> 00:16:30.865
[SACHIKO]
Think about it.

00:16:30.907 --> 00:16:33.576
When you want to express
your feelings to someone,

00:16:33.618 --> 00:16:35.953
how would you usually do it, eh?

00:16:35.995 --> 00:16:37.497
[DECIM]
Well, uh... I...

00:16:37.538 --> 00:16:39.123
Using words?

00:16:39.165 --> 00:16:41.000
Exactly, my dear.

00:16:41.042 --> 00:16:43.503
That's what most people think,
and I believe that's why

00:16:43.544 --> 00:16:45.588
the author wrote it
so Chavvot was deaf.

00:16:45.630 --> 00:16:46.964
[WOMAN, DECIM gasp]

00:16:47.006 --> 00:16:49.926
We don't always realize it,
but there are so many

00:16:49.967 --> 00:16:53.387
other ways of expressing our
emotions besides using words.

00:16:53.429 --> 00:16:57.183
Here's an example. Take a look.

00:16:57.225 --> 00:16:58.851
[DECIM]
A smile?

00:16:58.893 --> 00:17:01.646
Yes. A smile is universal.

00:17:01.687 --> 00:17:03.898
Wherever you're from,
it means you're happy.

00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:07.276
Just like a frown shows
everyone you're unhappy.

00:17:07.318 --> 00:17:09.362
It really is wondrous, isn't it?

00:17:09.403 --> 00:17:13.115
A language that
everybody speaks!

00:17:13.157 --> 00:17:15.409
--[GIRL] Mama!

You really like
"Chavvot," don't you?

00:17:20.831 --> 00:17:22.667
Yep! That okay?

00:17:22.708 --> 00:17:25.753
Well, of course!
Mama likes "Chavvot," too.

00:17:25.795 --> 00:17:28.172
Okay, good!

What part do you like most?

00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:35.096
Her smile really is
terrific, isn't it?

You're right. That's my
favorite part too, Chi!

00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:44.480
I'm pretty sure...
my name is Chiyuki.

[SACHIKO]
Oh! You remember your name now?

00:17:48.401 --> 00:17:50.278
Yes. I don't know what
could have changed,

00:17:50.319 --> 00:17:51.320
but I do!

00:17:51.362 --> 00:17:54.949
And what a beautiful
name it is, my dear.

00:17:54.991 --> 00:17:57.326
It's sweet of you to say so.

[CHIYUKI whimpers]

00:18:07.044 --> 00:18:09.130
I remember Mom.

00:18:17.722 --> 00:18:21.267
What is it? Is something wrong?

00:18:21.309 --> 00:18:23.185
No. It's nothing.

00:18:26.147 --> 00:18:28.733
In that case, I
believe it's my turn.

00:18:39.243 --> 00:18:41.412
[DECIM]
I'm out of cards.

00:18:41.454 --> 00:18:45.916
Which means, that this game
is now officially over.

00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:55.259
Are you coming, too, Chiyuki?

00:18:55.301 --> 00:18:57.803
Not yet. I'm going to
stay a little longer.

00:18:57.845 --> 00:19:01.015
Ah. Take care of yourself.

00:19:01.057 --> 00:19:02.183
Thanks.

00:19:02.224 --> 00:19:03.893
And you're quite sure
that it's all right

00:19:03.934 --> 00:19:06.354
if I take these
with me, young man?

00:19:06.395 --> 00:19:08.397
[DECIM]
Yes. You're welcome to them.

00:19:08.439 --> 00:19:11.359
[SACHIKO] Thank you
so much. I was thinking.

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:12.234
[gasps]

00:19:12.276 --> 00:19:14.278
You know how, in
Old Maid, the person

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:17.406
who gets left with the joker
in their hand is the loser?

00:19:17.448 --> 00:19:19.992
I've always found that rule
to be a rather strange one.

00:19:20.034 --> 00:19:21.619
[BOTH]
Huh?

00:19:21.661 --> 00:19:23.579
Just look at most
other card games.

00:19:23.621 --> 00:19:25.998
The joker's usually
a trump card.

00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:29.919
Having it left at the end
seems prudent to me.

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:31.754
Yes.

00:19:31.796 --> 00:19:33.964
Well, my dears.
It's been lovely.

00:19:34.006 --> 00:19:36.717
Thank you so much.

00:19:36.759 --> 00:19:37.885
Thank you for playing.

00:19:37.927 --> 00:19:39.929
Best of luck on your journey.

00:19:46.477 --> 00:19:49.980
[CHIYUKI]
So, out with it.

00:19:50.022 --> 00:19:52.149
I wanna know how it happened.

00:19:52.191 --> 00:19:57.405
I suppose that we really
can't do it this way, can we?

00:20:00.908 --> 00:20:02.618
[CLAVIS]
Here I am, Oculus, sir.

00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:04.995
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

00:20:05.037 --> 00:20:07.248
Clavis! There's my boy.

00:20:07.289 --> 00:20:11.085
I'm happy to help, sir.
What can I do for you?

00:20:11.127 --> 00:20:12.920
[OCULUS]
Cruel-hearted Nona seems to be

00:20:12.962 --> 00:20:15.256
avoiding me for
some reason. Tell me.

00:20:15.297 --> 00:20:16.841
You play billiards, don't ya?

00:20:16.882 --> 00:20:19.218
No, I'm sorry sir, but I can't.

00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:20.928
I'm only jokin'.

00:20:23.597 --> 00:20:26.350
[OCULUS] Hang tight. This
should only take a second.

00:20:29.979 --> 00:20:32.440
Isn't that just fascinating.

00:20:32.481 --> 00:20:36.193
An arbiter with human emotions.

00:20:36.235 --> 00:20:37.820
Sorry about that.

00:20:37.862 --> 00:20:39.238
What?

00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:41.407
We're all done here.
You can go now.

00:20:41.449 --> 00:20:44.869
Oh, all right. Thank you.
I'll get going, then.

00:20:47.413 --> 00:20:49.498
[OCULUS]
How utterly pointless.

00:20:50.791 --> 00:20:53.669
[DECIM] You know. I don't
believe people live

00:20:53.711 --> 00:20:56.547
just so that they
can die someday.

00:20:56.589 --> 00:20:58.048
I think it's because
they are alive

00:20:58.090 --> 00:21:00.176
that they must die
at some point.

00:21:00.217 --> 00:21:01.302
[CHIYUKI]
Hmm.

00:21:01.343 --> 00:21:03.929
I believe that there is
a purpose to being alive.

00:21:03.971 --> 00:21:05.222
[gasps]

00:21:05.264 --> 00:21:08.392
And there's a purpose
to judgment, as well.

00:21:08.434 --> 00:21:11.103
Judging is tricky.
Difficult to do right.

00:21:11.145 --> 00:21:15.024
It goes hand-in-hand
with both life and death.

00:21:15.065 --> 00:21:17.735
By its very nature, it must
be performed hand-in-hand

00:21:17.777 --> 00:21:19.570
with human beings.

00:21:19.612 --> 00:21:23.574
And because of that, it
requires human emotions.

00:21:27.286 --> 00:21:29.455
[CHIYUKI gasps]

00:21:29.497 --> 00:21:31.373
Chiyuki, please.

00:21:31.415 --> 00:21:32.875
Sorry?

00:21:32.917 --> 00:21:34.627
If you don't mind.

00:21:34.668 --> 00:21:38.130
I need you to fill in
the blanks for me.

00:21:38.172 --> 00:21:39.757
What?

00:22:58.586 --> 00:23:00.129
Huh.

00:23:14.602 --> 00:23:17.813
