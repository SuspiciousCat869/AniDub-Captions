00:00:09.176 --> 00:00:11.386
[QUIN] Hello, there.
Information bureau.

00:00:11.428 --> 00:00:13.138
I have a favor to ask.

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:14.681
[QUIN]
Oh?

00:00:14.723 --> 00:00:15.891
[DECIM] Do you think I
could have you send me

00:00:15.933 --> 00:00:18.644
some memories, please?

00:00:18.685 --> 00:00:21.313
Yes. Thank you very much.

00:00:25.692 --> 00:00:27.069

[elevator dings]

00:00:42.626 --> 00:00:44.253
[gasps]

00:00:45.754 --> 00:00:47.256
And where are you going?

00:00:47.297 --> 00:00:50.092
What's it matter
to you, old man?

00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:53.220
[OCULUS] I hope you enjoyed
yourself. Looked like fun.

00:00:53.262 --> 00:00:54.513
Sorry?

00:00:54.555 --> 00:00:56.890
You've been bad, Nona.

00:01:01.103 --> 00:01:02.521
[grunts]

00:01:04.398 --> 00:01:06.275
[NONA]
No way are you sneaking a peek.

00:01:06.316 --> 00:01:08.193
What you've been up
to isn't gonna fly.

00:01:08.235 --> 00:01:11.029
Arbiters have to be dummies,
that's how it works.

00:01:11.071 --> 00:01:14.032
Do they? Or is that
just to suit you?

00:01:14.074 --> 00:01:17.411
Why don't you tell me
what you're after here.

00:01:17.452 --> 00:01:18.620
[NONA]
You want to know?

00:01:18.662 --> 00:01:19.454
[OCULUS]
Mm.

00:01:19.496 --> 00:01:22.457
[NONA] Well, the fact
is, we can change.

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:24.501
[OCULUS] I take it you're
talking about arbiters

00:01:24.543 --> 00:01:26.587
who possess human emotions?

00:01:26.628 --> 00:01:28.797
Yeah, that's right.
Come on, don't you see?

00:01:28.839 --> 00:01:30.173
We aren't just hollow dummies!

00:01:30.215 --> 00:01:31.300
Ah.

00:01:31.341 --> 00:01:33.969
[laughs]

00:01:34.011 --> 00:01:37.723
[OCULUS] That's so ridiculous,
it's making my flower shrivel.

00:01:37.764 --> 00:01:41.393
We're all just dummies, Nona,
and that includes me.

00:01:41.435 --> 00:01:42.811
[NONA gasps]

00:01:42.853 --> 00:01:45.063
[OCULUS]
Do you understand it yet?

00:01:45.105 --> 00:01:46.523
Have you figured out
what we are?

00:01:46.565 --> 00:01:49.234
What we're made of?

00:01:49.276 --> 00:01:52.279
The souls of those
cast into the void.

00:01:52.321 --> 00:01:55.449
Don't even get me
started on our location.

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:56.783
We are what we are.

00:01:56.825 --> 00:01:59.244
As long as our fundamental
essence stays the same,

00:01:59.286 --> 00:02:02.331
this nonsense you're trying
to pull won't change anything.

00:02:02.372 --> 00:02:03.915
Face it, my dear.

00:02:03.957 --> 00:02:06.209
The arbiters will behave
as they always have.

00:02:06.251 --> 00:02:07.628
[NONA]
That isn't true!

00:02:07.669 --> 00:02:08.920
[OCULUS]
Go ahead.

00:02:08.962 --> 00:02:10.922
Ah.

00:02:10.964 --> 00:02:14.134
You'll see the truth
of things soon enough.

00:02:18.347 --> 00:02:20.432
[elevator dings]

00:02:20.474 --> 00:02:23.101
Thank you for waiting. Huh?

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:29.900
Please take us to the
lowest level, Clavis.

00:02:29.941 --> 00:02:31.735
Uh. Really? Are you sure?

00:02:31.777 --> 00:02:34.237
I am sure, thank you.

00:02:35.364 --> 00:02:37.115
[CLAVIS]
And you're taking her with you?

00:02:37.157 --> 00:02:38.825
[DECIM]
That is correct.

00:02:40.035 --> 00:02:41.662
Okay.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.885
[CHIYUKI'S MOM]
Chiyuki? Chiyuki.

00:02:56.927 --> 00:02:58.762
[CHIYUKI grunts]

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:09.815
[gasps] What? This looks
like my room. But how?

00:03:14.152 --> 00:03:16.196
Impossible. There's no way I--

00:03:16.238 --> 00:03:18.865
--[CHIYUKI yelps]
--[thud]

00:03:18.907 --> 00:03:20.200
[CHIYUKI]
Ow.

00:03:22.703 --> 00:03:24.246
[gasps]

00:03:24.287 --> 00:03:26.289
[door scrapes]

00:03:26.331 --> 00:03:28.959
You woke sooner than
I was expecting.

00:03:30.168 --> 00:03:32.546
[DECIM] May I ask what
it is you're doing?

00:03:32.587 --> 00:03:34.464
No.

00:03:40.429 --> 00:03:42.639
[DECIM]
Oh, look. I remember these.

00:03:42.681 --> 00:03:44.683
They're the dolls your
mother made, right?

00:03:44.725 --> 00:03:45.809
[CHIYUKI]
Mm-hmm.

00:03:45.851 --> 00:03:47.436
[DECIM]
She's quite talented.

00:03:47.477 --> 00:03:50.188
[CHIYUKI]
Huh? How do you figure?

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.191
They don't look
anything like the book.

00:03:53.233 --> 00:03:56.528
That's okay. I
treasured them anyway.

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:07.164
This has been so strange.

00:04:07.205 --> 00:04:09.875
I was starting to
think it was a dream.

00:04:09.916 --> 00:04:12.878
I'm afraid this is reality.
It all happened.

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:15.547
Three months have passed
since your death.

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:26.767
Would you like me
to give you a hand?

00:04:26.808 --> 00:04:30.020
[CHIYUKI] That's okay.
I can walk on my own.

00:04:48.622 --> 00:04:50.665
It's empty.

00:04:50.707 --> 00:04:52.083
[gasps]

00:05:08.475 --> 00:05:09.476
[CHIYUKI]
Mama!

00:05:09.518 --> 00:05:10.644
[CHIYUKI gasps]

00:05:10.685 --> 00:05:12.270
Read me the book again!

00:05:12.312 --> 00:05:14.856
[CHIYUKI'S MOM] You really
like "Chavvot," don't you?

00:05:24.991 --> 00:05:26.493
[CHIYUKI gasps]

00:05:32.541 --> 00:05:33.500
[door clicks]

00:05:33.542 --> 00:05:34.543
[gasps]

00:05:34.584 --> 00:05:36.127
[CHIYUKI'S MOM]
Well, I'm home.

00:05:38.213 --> 00:05:40.006
That's my mom.

00:05:49.891 --> 00:05:52.602
[gasps] Oh, god, Mom!

00:05:52.644 --> 00:05:54.980
Hello, Chiyuki. I'm home again.

00:05:55.021 --> 00:05:56.565
[CHIYUKI gasps]

00:05:58.692 --> 00:06:01.486
[DECIM] She is neither
able to see nor hear us.

00:06:01.528 --> 00:06:03.697
We can't touch people
in the living world.

00:06:03.738 --> 00:06:05.615
We cannot converse with them.

00:06:05.657 --> 00:06:08.326
We can't make contact
of any kind.

00:06:14.207 --> 00:06:17.127
[CHIYUKI] You could've
told me all that sooner.

00:06:17.168 --> 00:06:19.129
[DECIM]
I am terribly sorry.

00:06:22.507 --> 00:06:25.468
Why bring me here, anyway?

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:28.597
If you would please take this.

00:06:28.638 --> 00:06:30.181
[gasps]

00:06:31.766 --> 00:06:33.310
What's going on?

00:06:33.351 --> 00:06:35.145
This is why I brought you here.

00:06:35.186 --> 00:06:38.023
It wasn't just to give you
a glimpse of your old life.

00:06:38.064 --> 00:06:39.024
[CHIYUKI]
Huh?

00:06:39.065 --> 00:06:42.319
Did you know 7,000
people die every hour?

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:45.488
That's approximately
two per second.

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:48.742
While it lasts, life is
riddled with unfairness.

00:06:48.783 --> 00:06:51.244
There are those who
live fulfilling lives.

00:06:51.286 --> 00:06:54.873
And there are those who pass
away sooner than they should.

00:06:54.915 --> 00:06:56.499
[gasps]

00:06:56.541 --> 00:06:58.668
[DECIM]
Please listen closely.

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:00.879
I have a bargain to offer you.

00:07:00.921 --> 00:07:03.006
In exchange for the
life of one person,

00:07:03.048 --> 00:07:05.592
I can bring you back
to life, right now.

00:07:05.634 --> 00:07:07.385
[gasps]

00:07:08.345 --> 00:07:10.138
[DECIM]
Simply press this button.

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:12.307
If you do that, all of your
memories of Quindecim

00:07:12.349 --> 00:07:17.228
will be erased, and you
will return to your life.

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:18.688
You must choose
quickly, however.

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:20.732
Little time remains.

00:07:25.278 --> 00:07:27.405
What will your decision be?

00:07:38.333 --> 00:07:40.961
[CHIYUKI] My life for someone
else's? That's the deal?

00:07:41.002 --> 00:07:42.462
Yes.

00:07:43.463 --> 00:07:44.589
It's possible that it will be

00:07:44.631 --> 00:07:48.051
one of my friends
or family who dies.

00:07:48.093 --> 00:07:48.843
[DECIM]
Yes.

00:07:48.885 --> 00:07:51.513
However, do consider
the world's population.

00:07:51.554 --> 00:07:53.598
It's currently more
than 7,000,000,000,

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:56.267
which makes that
highly improbable.

00:07:56.309 --> 00:07:59.688
Your mother, your
father, your friends.

00:07:59.729 --> 00:08:01.147
Everybody who knows
you will have

00:08:01.189 --> 00:08:04.317
any and all memories
of your death erased.

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:12.867
[CHIYUKI'S MOM]
You know, Chiyuki.

00:08:12.909 --> 00:08:14.244
Watching you skate was always

00:08:14.285 --> 00:08:18.206
one of the highlights of
my life, but what made me

00:08:18.248 --> 00:08:20.125
happiest was watching
you grow up.

00:08:20.166 --> 00:08:22.627
Seeing you become a good woman.

00:08:23.962 --> 00:08:27.924
[sobs] I'm not a good woman.

00:08:27.966 --> 00:08:30.385
[gasps]

00:08:30.427 --> 00:08:32.554
[CHIYUKI]
Just go, okay?

00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:35.682
[CHIYUKI] The fact that
I couldn't skate anymore

00:08:35.724 --> 00:08:38.435
wasn't what was hard for me.

00:08:38.476 --> 00:08:41.938
People can't know
each other perfectly.

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:44.816
And to hope for that
kind of understanding.

00:08:44.858 --> 00:08:46.901
It's wrong.

00:08:53.575 --> 00:08:55.201
[CHIYUKI gasps]

00:08:56.745 --> 00:08:59.914
[CHIYUKI'S MOM] Here.
It was always your favorite.

00:09:03.043 --> 00:09:04.753
[CHIYUKI'S MOM]
You know, it's funny.

00:09:04.794 --> 00:09:08.006
I just can't seem
to stop making extra.

00:09:15.889 --> 00:09:19.642
Oh, Chiyuki. I'm so sorry.

00:09:19.684 --> 00:09:23.396
I had no idea. I couldn't
tell what you were feeling.

--I was so blind.
--[CHIYUKI gasps]

00:09:26.441 --> 00:09:31.362
[CHIYUKI'S MOM]
I've failed as a mother.

00:09:31.404 --> 00:09:33.114
I'm sorry!

00:09:33.156 --> 00:09:34.616
What kind of mother
can't even tell

00:09:34.657 --> 00:09:36.910
what her own
daughter is feeling?

00:09:36.951 --> 00:09:40.914
It's not true!
Mom, it's not true!

00:09:40.955 --> 00:09:42.582
I miss you so much!

00:09:42.624 --> 00:09:44.834
[gasps] Mom!

00:09:47.921 --> 00:09:51.591
I accept. Give me my life back.

00:09:51.633 --> 00:09:54.344
I have to tell my mom
it wasn't her fault!

00:09:54.385 --> 00:09:58.098
I have to say sorry.

00:09:58.139 --> 00:09:59.682
People have an
instinctive desire

00:09:59.724 --> 00:10:01.601
to understand each other, right?

00:10:01.643 --> 00:10:06.898
Maybe that's not so bad.
Or maybe it is, I don't know.

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:09.067
But it's still what I want.

00:10:09.109 --> 00:10:10.860
So, yes.

00:10:19.077 --> 00:10:21.454
[CHIYUKI]
I'm getting a second chance.

00:10:21.496 --> 00:10:24.999
Let someone else die
and I can live.

00:10:36.136 --> 00:10:40.682
[CHIYUKI] I have to, right?
It's the only choice I can make.

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:51.985
[CHIYUKI gasps]

00:10:52.026 --> 00:10:54.529
You know, you're
actually right for once.

00:10:54.571 --> 00:10:58.575
Yeah, I'm in love
with somebody else.

00:10:59.617 --> 00:11:02.328
Like I said. I think I still
have a date to claim.

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:04.831
I've always wanted to.

00:11:06.207 --> 00:11:08.209
Why couldn't I just
give her that?

00:11:08.251 --> 00:11:09.502
She was always so good to me.

00:11:09.544 --> 00:11:11.171
I'll do anything you want.

00:11:11.212 --> 00:11:13.923
Please just send me
back to my children.

00:11:15.258 --> 00:11:16.509
[TATSUMI]
I heard my wife's voice

00:11:16.551 --> 00:11:18.344
thanking me for what I did.

00:11:18.386 --> 00:11:20.221
So I decided that
my new job would be

00:11:20.263 --> 00:11:21.973
exacting vengeance
for helpless victims.

00:11:22.015 --> 00:11:24.142
[CHIYUKI]
Please, control your anger.

00:11:24.184 --> 00:11:26.936
Don't you wanna be
with your sister again?

00:11:26.978 --> 00:11:30.773
[SHIMADA grunting]

00:11:30.815 --> 00:11:32.192
[SACHIKO]
It may be over now,

00:11:32.233 --> 00:11:35.570
but at least I know
that I lived a full life.

00:11:38.781 --> 00:11:41.993
[CHIYUKI]
I can't. I can't press it.

00:11:42.035 --> 00:11:43.745
I don't understand.

00:11:45.079 --> 00:11:50.835
It isn't right. Everybody
matters to somebody.

00:11:50.877 --> 00:11:52.879
[DECIM] But whoever ended
up dying in your place

00:11:52.921 --> 00:11:54.797
most likely wouldn't
matter to you.

00:11:54.839 --> 00:11:57.050
[CHIYUKI]
I'm not an idiot. I know that!

00:11:57.091 --> 00:12:00.970
I know it, but even if they
aren't important to me,

00:12:01.012 --> 00:12:03.973
there's someone out there
they are important to.

00:12:04.015 --> 00:12:05.433
Someone who cherishes them.

00:12:05.475 --> 00:12:07.602
[gasps]

00:12:07.644 --> 00:12:10.188
[CHIYUKI]
Somebody like my mom.

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:13.942
[DECIM gasps]

00:12:16.236 --> 00:12:19.989
But, god. If only
I could talk to her!

[DECIM grunts]

00:12:33.544 --> 00:12:35.838
[CHIYUKI sobbing]
Mom...

00:12:37.131 --> 00:12:41.970
[CHIYUKI] I'm so sorry
for not valuing my life.

00:12:42.011 --> 00:12:45.890
I'm so sorry for not
thinking of you.

00:12:45.932 --> 00:12:49.310
For doing something so selfish.

00:12:49.352 --> 00:12:54.649
For causing you
so much grief. Sorry!

00:12:54.691 --> 00:12:57.151
And for not giving
you the chance

00:12:57.193 --> 00:13:01.155
to say goodbye.
I'm so, so sorry!

00:13:01.197 --> 00:13:02.782
[gasps]

Here!

You press it!

[DECIM gasps]

I am terribly sorry.

[yells]

00:14:11.476 --> 00:14:13.478
[CHIYUKI]
What's going on?

00:14:17.815 --> 00:14:19.692
[DECIM]
None of it was true.

00:14:19.734 --> 00:14:22.612
I am so sorry for deceiving you.

00:14:22.653 --> 00:14:23.863
[CHIYUKI]
But why?

00:14:23.905 --> 00:14:28.368
[DECIM grunts] I am sorry for
putting you through all of this.

00:14:28.409 --> 00:14:31.037
You mean it was all
part of my judgment?

00:14:31.079 --> 00:14:32.288
[DECIM grunts]

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:33.498
[gasps]

00:14:33.539 --> 00:14:37.293
It hurts so much. This feeling.

00:14:37.335 --> 00:14:39.962
This is sorrow, isn't it?

00:14:40.004 --> 00:14:41.714
I think so.

00:14:41.756 --> 00:14:43.674
Hurting you hurt me.

00:14:43.716 --> 00:14:49.347
I just wanted to know you
better. To understand you.

00:14:49.389 --> 00:14:50.890
[gasps]

00:14:50.932 --> 00:14:53.810
[DECIM]
Chiyuki. I am truly sorry.

00:14:53.851 --> 00:14:58.981
But this was the only way.
I had to know. I'm sorry.

00:15:02.985 --> 00:15:06.531
[DECIM] I am an arbiter,
and arbiters judge.

00:15:11.202 --> 00:15:13.871
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

00:15:13.913 --> 00:15:15.289
[CHIYUKI]
It's okay.

00:15:15.331 --> 00:15:17.542
I'm so sorry.

00:15:17.583 --> 00:15:20.002
[CHIYUKI]
You don't have to apologize.

00:15:20.044 --> 00:15:21.462
But after what I did...

00:15:21.504 --> 00:15:23.131
It's okay, I understand.

00:15:23.172 --> 00:15:24.841
[gasps]

00:15:28.136 --> 00:15:40.690
[sobs]

00:15:54.829 --> 00:15:56.080
[NONA]
Decim.

00:15:56.122 --> 00:15:58.583
You've destroyed
that poor boy, Nona.

00:15:58.624 --> 00:16:00.251
I just had him
conduct a judgment

00:16:00.293 --> 00:16:01.794
together with a human.

00:16:01.836 --> 00:16:03.546
Things change as
arbiters come closer

00:16:03.588 --> 00:16:06.799
to being human. Judgment
becomes more difficult to pass,

00:16:06.841 --> 00:16:09.385
and it is accompanied
by suffering.

00:16:09.427 --> 00:16:12.555
One thing's clear.
Humans can't judge humans.

00:16:12.597 --> 00:16:14.307
If you know that,
then what was the point

00:16:14.348 --> 00:16:15.808
of this doomed experiment?

00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:17.518
Judging humans is
difficult, true.

00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:19.395
But that doesn't make
it right to assign

00:16:19.437 --> 00:16:23.107
any random judgment to them.
There needs to be a change.

00:16:23.149 --> 00:16:26.027
That was the point
of what I did.

00:16:26.068 --> 00:16:28.154
[OCULUS] So your goal is
to make arbiters suffer?

00:16:28.196 --> 00:16:31.532
Care to explain the
reasoning behind that?

00:16:31.574 --> 00:16:34.368
[NONA] A judgment ought to be
accompanied by suffering,

00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:36.287
or what's its purpose?

00:16:36.329 --> 00:16:37.455
[OCULUS]
Its purpose?

00:16:37.497 --> 00:16:39.832
[NONA]
To suffer, yet stand firm.

00:16:39.874 --> 00:16:42.668
That's what it is to live.
It's what gives life meaning.

00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:45.129
The meaning of life?

00:16:45.171 --> 00:16:46.339
That's what this is about?

00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:49.175
It's a concept. It's
only relevant to those

00:16:49.217 --> 00:16:52.887
who are able to die. And the
funny thing about dying--

00:16:52.929 --> 00:16:54.805
You can't do it
unless you're alive.

00:16:54.847 --> 00:16:56.599
Even if the arbiters
become more human,

00:16:56.641 --> 00:16:59.602
it doesn't change the fact
that they're just dummies.

00:16:59.644 --> 00:17:04.190
You're wrong. It is relevant.
We live in the present.

00:17:14.951 --> 00:17:17.036
[CHIYUKI]
What is this place, anyway?

00:17:17.078 --> 00:17:18.621
[DECIM] This is where the
dummies are disposed of

00:17:18.663 --> 00:17:20.790
after their judgment is
complete and their souls

00:17:20.831 --> 00:17:23.584
have been removed.
Under normal circumstances,

00:17:23.626 --> 00:17:26.629
no one is permitted
to come in here.

00:17:26.671 --> 00:17:28.798
So, this is where I'll end up?

00:17:28.839 --> 00:17:29.882
[DECIM]
No.

00:17:29.924 --> 00:17:32.552
Oh, good. Thanks for that.

00:17:33.594 --> 00:17:36.097
After they die,
some humans try to live

00:17:36.138 --> 00:17:37.890
all the more in the present.

00:17:37.932 --> 00:17:39.892
Those who led fulfilling
lives are the kind of--

00:17:39.934 --> 00:17:42.270
[CHIYUKI] The kind of people
you respect, right?

00:17:42.311 --> 00:17:43.062
[DECIM]
Yes.

00:17:43.104 --> 00:17:44.897
[CHIYUKI]
Heard that a million times.

00:17:44.939 --> 00:17:46.190
[DECIM]
Really? That many?

00:17:46.232 --> 00:17:48.693
[CHIYUKI]
Heh. Forget about it.

00:17:50.111 --> 00:17:52.697
[DECIM] I am terribly sorry
to have kept you waiting.

00:17:52.738 --> 00:17:53.781
Eh, no worries.

00:17:53.823 --> 00:17:55.908
You're stealing my
material, though.

00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:56.409
What?

00:17:56.450 --> 00:17:59.036
[CLAVIS]
Forget it.

00:17:59.078 --> 00:18:01.038
Hello there.

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:02.832
Good to see you.

00:18:04.875 --> 00:18:07.628
All right, folks.
Where're we headed?

00:18:09.338 --> 00:18:11.132
[OCULUS]
Nona.

00:18:11.173 --> 00:18:14.885
You have become quite
fascinated with life and death,

00:18:14.927 --> 00:18:16.470
haven't you?

00:18:17.888 --> 00:18:19.557
[DECIM]
Miss Chiyuki.

00:18:19.599 --> 00:18:20.683
[CHIYUKI]
Hmm?

00:18:20.725 --> 00:18:22.935
[DECIM]
Was it worth it? Being alive?

00:18:22.977 --> 00:18:24.103
[gasps]

00:18:27.315 --> 00:18:29.525
Mm.

00:18:29.567 --> 00:18:31.527
[DECIM]
That is wonderful to hear.

00:18:31.569 --> 00:18:32.695
That's my goal now.

00:18:32.737 --> 00:18:34.363
To be the kind of
arbiter who can help

00:18:34.405 --> 00:18:39.035
all his guests feel that way.
I am glad I succeeded with you.

00:18:39.076 --> 00:18:40.369
Yeah.

00:18:42.163 --> 00:18:43.122
Some advice, though.

00:18:43.164 --> 00:18:45.249
Might do something
about your face.

00:18:45.291 --> 00:18:46.000
[DECIM]
Huh?

00:18:46.042 --> 00:18:48.544
You do know how to
smile, don't you?

00:18:48.586 --> 00:18:50.921
[DECIM]
Er, is it like this?

00:18:50.963 --> 00:18:52.965
[sighs] Baby steps, I guess.

00:18:53.007 --> 00:18:55.635
I am terribly sorry I failed.

00:18:55.676 --> 00:18:57.428
[CHIYUKI] You'll get it
before long, don't worry.

00:18:57.470 --> 00:18:58.846
Well, this is it, huh?

00:18:58.888 --> 00:19:02.224
[DECIM] Yes. Best of luck
on your journey.

00:19:02.266 --> 00:19:03.976
Goodbye, then.

00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:31.253
[CHIYUKI gasps]

00:19:43.974 --> 00:19:45.351
[DECIM]
Farewell.

00:19:50.147 --> 00:19:53.359
[CLAVIS]
Hey, where'd Memine go?

00:19:53.401 --> 00:19:54.610
[GINTI]
I dunno.

00:19:54.652 --> 00:19:55.611
Huh?

00:19:55.653 --> 00:19:58.698
She doesn't come around
anymore, that's all.

00:20:00.074 --> 00:20:01.409
[grunts]

00:20:02.702 --> 00:20:04.161
[GINTI]
What're you doing?

00:20:04.203 --> 00:20:06.163
Pour me a drink, bartender!

00:20:06.205 --> 00:20:09.166
Why? What exactly is
going on with you today?

00:20:09.208 --> 00:20:11.961
[CLAVIS] Please, like you
actually care, Ginti.

00:20:12.002 --> 00:20:13.921
[GINTI]
Tch, whatever.

00:20:15.339 --> 00:20:17.174
[CASTRA]
Oh, yeah? Your boy did it?

00:20:17.216 --> 00:20:17.842
[NONA]
Mm-hmm.

00:20:17.883 --> 00:20:19.885
This sounds like a
real game-changer.

00:20:19.927 --> 00:20:22.471
There are so many
arbiters. What do we do?

00:20:22.513 --> 00:20:24.265
Should we retain the
memories of death again

00:20:24.306 --> 00:20:26.475
and forward them on?

00:20:26.517 --> 00:20:28.978
Nah. Let's just see
what happens for a bit.

00:20:29.019 --> 00:20:30.980
We don't have to do anything.

00:20:31.021 --> 00:20:33.065
Old flower-head's been
watching her like a hawk.

00:20:33.107 --> 00:20:34.191
You know that, right?

00:20:34.233 --> 00:20:36.527
Yeah? What is she thinking?

00:20:36.569 --> 00:20:38.779
[QUIN] We just need
to behave ourselves.

00:20:38.821 --> 00:20:39.780
Number One:

00:20:39.822 --> 00:20:41.991
Arbiters cannot stop
making judgments,

00:20:42.032 --> 00:20:44.201
for this task is
more than their job.

00:20:44.243 --> 00:20:47.747
It is the entire reason
for their existence.

00:20:47.788 --> 00:20:48.748
Number Two:

00:20:48.789 --> 00:20:50.666
Arbiters cannot
experience death,

00:20:50.708 --> 00:20:52.626
for that would taint
their judgments.

00:20:52.668 --> 00:20:55.755
It would make them too
close to being human.

00:20:55.796 --> 00:20:56.797
Number Three:

00:20:56.839 --> 00:20:59.008
Arbiters cannot feel emotions,

00:20:59.049 --> 00:21:01.135
for doing so is not
in their natures.

00:21:01.177 --> 00:21:04.930
It is impossible for a
dummy to have feelings.

00:21:04.972 --> 00:21:07.641
[OCULUS] Number Four:
Arbiters may not work

00:21:07.683 --> 00:21:11.687
hand-in-hand with life,
for doing so would ruin them.

00:21:11.729 --> 00:21:14.940
