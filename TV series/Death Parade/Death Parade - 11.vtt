WEBVTT

00:00:09.635 --> 00:00:12.304
[OCULUS] Hang tight. This
should only take a second.

00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:18.519
Isn't that just fascinating.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.605
An arbiter with human emotions.

00:00:23.482 --> 00:00:26.235
[DECIM] You know. I don't
believe people live

00:00:26.276 --> 00:00:29.071
just so that they
can die someday.

00:00:29.112 --> 00:00:30.572
I think it's because
they are alive

00:00:30.614 --> 00:00:32.908
that they must die
at some point.

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:33.909
[CHIYUKI]
Hmm.

00:00:33.951 --> 00:00:36.286
I believe that there is
a purpose to being alive.

00:00:36.328 --> 00:00:37.663
[gasps]

00:00:37.704 --> 00:00:40.791
And there's a purpose
to judgment, as well.

00:00:40.832 --> 00:00:43.335
Judging is tricky.
Difficult to do right.

00:00:43.377 --> 00:00:47.339
It goes hand-in-hand
with both life and death.

00:00:47.381 --> 00:00:49.925
By its very nature, it must
be performed hand-in-hand

00:00:49.967 --> 00:00:51.843
with human beings.

00:00:51.885 --> 00:00:56.139
And because of that,
it requires human emotions.

00:00:58.976 --> 00:01:01.979
[QUIN]
There you go. It's done.

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.813
[QUIN sighs]

00:01:02.854 --> 00:01:04.439
It's lovely, isn't it?

00:01:04.481 --> 00:01:08.026
Yeah, sure. At first
glance, anyway. But...

00:01:08.068 --> 00:01:09.069
But this isn't all.

00:01:09.111 --> 00:01:12.531
There are no lives
without darkness. None.

00:01:12.573 --> 00:01:14.658
[QUIN]
You got that one right.

00:02:38.533 --> 00:02:42.329
What? No way! Harada?
How are you here?

00:02:42.371 --> 00:02:44.247
Didn't you go to
that void place?

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:47.209
Harada! Hello? Harada, wake up!

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.127
Huh. What's with him?

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:52.130
[GINTI] That's just a shell.
His soul hasn't come back yet.

00:02:52.172 --> 00:02:54.216
Whoa, his soul's missing? Um.

00:02:54.257 --> 00:02:56.385
So, how do you get it
to come back, then?

00:02:56.426 --> 00:02:57.094
Not easily.

00:02:57.135 --> 00:03:00.138
You need a soul to cast
into the void in its place.

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.974
Seriously? And if his
soul doesn't come back?

00:03:03.016 --> 00:03:03.767
What then?

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:05.477
--[clatter]
--[gasps]

00:03:06.687 --> 00:03:08.897
You get stuck with this.

00:03:11.358 --> 00:03:12.859
Oh, wow.

00:03:14.236 --> 00:03:16.780
I have to choose a soul
to send into the void.

00:03:16.822 --> 00:03:18.657
Mine should be
good enough, right?

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:19.783
[GINTI]
Hm?

00:03:19.825 --> 00:03:22.035
I don't see why I
can't take his place!

00:03:22.077 --> 00:03:24.663
[grunts] You little idiot.

00:03:24.705 --> 00:03:26.665
Do you have any clue
what the void is like?

00:03:26.707 --> 00:03:27.791
No, how would I?

00:03:27.833 --> 00:03:28.917
[growls]

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:31.628
[GINTI]
Unfathomably reckless moron!

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.172
It's in the name:
a space containing nothing.

00:03:34.214 --> 00:03:36.299
It's a graveyard for souls.

00:03:36.341 --> 00:03:38.677
Your mind is all that remains.

00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:41.763
Terror. Regret. Despair.

00:03:41.805 --> 00:03:44.349
The sensation of falling
forever while feeling

00:03:44.391 --> 00:03:46.977
only the worst emotions.

00:03:47.018 --> 00:03:49.521
That's the kind of
place the void is.

00:03:49.563 --> 00:03:51.940
There's no way!
You're making that up!

00:03:51.982 --> 00:03:53.316
No, I'm not.

00:03:53.358 --> 00:03:56.695
But I've got someone else
who can take his place.

00:03:56.737 --> 00:04:00.157
Harada or this guy.
The choice is up to you.

00:04:00.198 --> 00:04:03.243
Who gets the void?

00:04:03.285 --> 00:04:04.745
[MAYU]
What?

00:04:12.961 --> 00:04:15.756
[DECIM] Chiyuki, please.
If you don't mind.

00:04:15.797 --> 00:04:19.384
I need you to fill in
the blanks for me.

00:04:19.426 --> 00:04:22.596
I don't understand
what you want me to say.

00:04:24.514 --> 00:04:26.308
Start with this.

00:04:38.403 --> 00:04:40.655
[MAYU] I don't get it.
Why do I have to choose?

00:04:40.697 --> 00:04:42.532
[GINTI] Human behavior
is so predictable.

00:04:42.574 --> 00:04:43.658
You're all a bunch of idiots.

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:44.409
Huh?

00:04:44.451 --> 00:04:46.203
[GINTI] You all seem to
forget that someday

00:04:46.244 --> 00:04:47.287
you're gonna die.

00:04:47.329 --> 00:04:50.081
Until suddenly, you come
face-to-face with death.

00:04:50.123 --> 00:04:54.085
Then you start clinging to life.
That's why, up to now,

00:04:54.127 --> 00:04:55.921
I've never had so much
as a second thought

00:04:55.962 --> 00:04:57.672
about my judgments.

00:04:57.714 --> 00:04:59.090
[gasps]

00:05:12.938 --> 00:05:15.482
[GINTI]
Hm.

00:05:15.524 --> 00:05:18.485
When you've made a decision,
press this button.

00:05:27.369 --> 00:05:28.787
So, who is this guy, anyway?

00:05:28.829 --> 00:05:30.789
[GINTI] Is that something
you need to know?

00:05:30.831 --> 00:05:32.040
What?

00:05:32.082 --> 00:05:33.875
To cast Harada into the void,

00:05:33.917 --> 00:05:35.752
what kind of person
would it take?

00:05:35.794 --> 00:05:40.966
[gasps] I don't know,
but I would never do it.

00:05:41.007 --> 00:05:44.177
Then it sounds like
you've got your answer.

00:06:00.569 --> 00:06:02.195
[MAYU sighs]

If you'll come this way, please.

Welcome to Quindecim.
Have a seat.

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:48.283
My name is Decim.
A pleasure to meet you.

00:06:48.325 --> 00:06:50.869
I will be your bartender
while you're here.

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:59.836
I'm sorry. Is
something the matter?

00:06:59.878 --> 00:07:03.465
I'm confused. What am
I doing here?

00:07:03.506 --> 00:07:05.425
I'm supposed to be dead.

00:07:05.467 --> 00:07:08.845
[DECIM grunts]

00:07:08.887 --> 00:07:13.016
[DECIM] You can remember
that you're dead, then?

00:07:13.058 --> 00:07:14.351
Yes, but...

00:07:18.939 --> 00:07:21.149
What I don't remember
is how it happened.

00:07:21.191 --> 00:07:23.360
[DECIM gasps]

00:07:23.401 --> 00:07:26.279
[CHIYUKI]
Please. Tell me.

00:07:28.323 --> 00:07:30.575
[NONA]
Oh, really? That's unusual.

00:07:30.617 --> 00:07:32.243
[DECIM] Obviously, I was
unable to prompt her

00:07:32.285 --> 00:07:33.536
to play a game.

00:07:33.578 --> 00:07:35.747
It sounds like the
information bureau screwed up.

00:07:35.789 --> 00:07:37.540
Don't worry, all right?
I'll deal with her.

00:07:37.582 --> 00:07:39.376
Deal with her? How do you mean?

00:07:39.417 --> 00:07:40.377
We'll erase her memories

00:07:40.418 --> 00:07:43.171
and start her judgment over.
Not too difficult.

00:07:43.213 --> 00:07:44.881
Let's go ahead and
bring her with us.

00:07:44.923 --> 00:07:46.883
Certainly, ma'am. I'm on it.

00:07:51.137 --> 00:07:52.681
If it's not an imposition,

00:07:52.722 --> 00:07:55.141
I'd actually like to
handle her judgment.

00:07:55.183 --> 00:07:56.726
Why's that?

00:07:58.687 --> 00:08:00.689
I'm not really sure.

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:02.190
Huh?

00:08:05.735 --> 00:08:07.195

Hm.

00:08:07.237 --> 00:08:09.155
Well, if you want to, go ahead,

00:08:09.197 --> 00:08:11.074
but I think I'll
leave her here awhile.

00:08:11.116 --> 00:08:12.200
[DECIM]
Hm?

00:08:12.242 --> 00:08:15.078

As an assistant of sorts.

[CHIYUKI]
Mm-hmm.

00:13:28.725 --> 00:13:31.352
I sustained a

[CHIYUKI]
They ran some tests.

Before long, they told me that
I would never skate again.

Everyone cried for me.

00:13:40.278 --> 00:13:45.283
They were all so sympathetic.
But me? I didn't feel anything.

No matter what anyone said,
nothing got through to me.

00:13:48.369 --> 00:13:51.622

tell anybody that.

Hm. This is the trophy you won

in the first

00:14:30.578 --> 00:14:32.663
You know, Chiyuki.

Watching you skate was
always one of the highlights

00:14:34.832 --> 00:14:38.378
of my life, but what
made me happiest

00:14:38.419 --> 00:14:42.924
was watching you grow up.
Seeing you become a good woman.

00:14:42.965 --> 00:14:45.051
I'm not, though.

00:14:45.093 --> 00:14:46.594
What?

00:14:48.846 --> 00:14:52.809
[sobs] I'm not a good woman.

Okay.

[CHIYUKI sobbing]

00:15:08.825 --> 00:15:10.410
[CHIYUKI] The fact that
I couldn't skate anymore

00:15:10.451 --> 00:15:13.579
wasn't what was hard for me.

00:15:13.621 --> 00:15:15.039
There were lots of
other things in my life

00:15:15.081 --> 00:15:19.043
that were more important.
Like my family and friends.

00:15:19.085 --> 00:15:21.587
I had lots of
friends from skating.

00:15:21.629 --> 00:15:23.339
I didn't really
know what was wrong.

00:15:23.381 --> 00:15:27.677
I was just so
confused at the time.

00:15:27.718 --> 00:15:29.595
But now, I think I know.

00:15:29.637 --> 00:15:31.889
These people I'd
been so close to.

00:15:31.931 --> 00:15:35.768
They were, in a very
real sense, strangers.

00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:37.728
I mean, they weren't me.

00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:39.272
It sounds so obvious, right?

00:15:39.313 --> 00:15:42.233
But somehow I'd never
realized it before.

00:15:42.275 --> 00:15:45.361
And suddenly, everything
started to seem hollow.

00:15:45.403 --> 00:15:48.865
I just felt like...
"I'm nothing. I'm nobody."

00:15:48.906 --> 00:15:50.867
I couldn't get those
thoughts out of my head.

00:15:50.908 --> 00:15:55.538
They festered, and I started
hating myself. Till finally...

00:15:57.081 --> 00:15:59.083
[CHIYUKI]
I took my own life.

00:16:02.295 --> 00:16:05.715
[CHIYUKI] People can't know
each other perfectly.

00:16:05.756 --> 00:16:08.676
And to hope for that
kind of understanding...

00:16:08.718 --> 00:16:14.390
It's wrong. I didn't realize
that until I was dead.

00:16:14.432 --> 00:16:16.976
Until too late.

00:16:17.018 --> 00:16:18.436
Life is so cruel.

00:16:18.478 --> 00:16:20.104
[DECIM gasps]

00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:25.568
[DECIM] From my understanding,
when humans are happy,

00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:29.530
they smile. And when they
are sad, they shed tears.

00:16:29.572 --> 00:16:30.990
Chiyuki, may I ask you

00:16:31.032 --> 00:16:34.702
what emotion you are
feeling right now?

00:16:34.744 --> 00:16:37.330
Well, obviously I'm
feeling sad, right?

00:16:37.371 --> 00:16:39.749
And if I told you I
wanted to understand that,

00:16:39.790 --> 00:16:41.584
you would say
that's wrong of me?

00:16:41.626 --> 00:16:43.044
Huh?

00:16:44.795 --> 00:16:45.755
Because it's true.

00:16:45.796 --> 00:16:47.340
Regardless of
whether it's possible,

00:16:47.381 --> 00:16:49.717
I wish I could know you better.

00:16:53.471 --> 00:16:55.389
[DECIM] I've never been
part of the living world.

00:16:55.431 --> 00:16:58.851
Nor have I experienced death.

00:16:58.893 --> 00:17:02.688
I'm afraid I don't know the
correct way to express this,

00:17:02.730 --> 00:17:07.193
but I am glad I got to meet you.
It's truly been my pleasure.

00:17:07.235 --> 00:17:08.694
[gasps]

00:17:13.074 --> 00:17:14.575
Uh--

00:17:18.287 --> 00:17:19.747
Listen, Decim.

00:17:19.789 --> 00:17:21.707
Certainly. I'm listening.

00:17:23.417 --> 00:17:27.630
[sighs] Nothing, never mind.

00:17:37.431 --> 00:17:40.893
[CHIYUKI]
My last drink at Quindecim.

00:17:40.935 --> 00:17:42.770
So, what's this one called?

00:17:42.812 --> 00:17:45.398
[DECIM] A "memento mori."
Apparently it means

00:17:45.439 --> 00:17:48.442
"Remember that you must die."

00:17:48.484 --> 00:17:51.153
[CHIYUKI]
"Remember that you must die."

00:17:52.572 --> 00:17:55.408
"Do not forget that you
are certain to die someday,

00:17:55.449 --> 00:17:58.452
and, as such, you have all
the more reason to live now."

00:17:58.494 --> 00:18:01.664
I believe that is how the
phrase should be interpreted.

00:18:01.706 --> 00:18:04.625
"Live now"? A little late.

00:18:05.585 --> 00:18:06.586
Shall we?

00:18:06.627 --> 00:18:08.129
Cheers, Decim.

00:18:11.132 --> 00:18:13.342
Wow that's delicious!

00:18:16.887 --> 00:18:19.140
[DECIM]
I am terribly sorry for this.

00:18:19.181 --> 00:18:22.893
[CHIYUKI gasps]

00:18:22.935 --> 00:18:24.478
[CHIYUKI]
Oh.

00:18:39.368 --> 00:18:40.911
So where are we going now?

00:18:40.953 --> 00:18:43.456
[GINTI] You're headed for the
place where Harada's soul is.

00:18:43.497 --> 00:18:45.750
And he's really going to
wake up? You promise me?

00:18:45.791 --> 00:18:47.376
[GINTI]
Yeah.

00:18:47.418 --> 00:18:48.711
Something I've been wondering.

00:18:48.753 --> 00:18:51.756
Who exactly is Harada
to you, anyway?

00:18:51.797 --> 00:18:53.883
Don't you get it? He's my life.

00:18:53.924 --> 00:18:54.884
[GINTI]
Oh, really?

00:18:54.925 --> 00:18:58.220
So what would your life be,
then, if Harada wasn't around?

00:18:58.262 --> 00:19:00.723
What's that mean?
Are you making fun of me?

00:19:00.765 --> 00:19:04.143
I want an answer.
What's your life's meaning?

00:19:04.185 --> 00:19:06.228
[MAYU]
I've got no clue, okay?

00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:07.521
Why does there have
to be any meaning?

00:19:07.563 --> 00:19:10.566
Oh, perfect. Someone
else who has no idea.

00:19:10.608 --> 00:19:12.485
[MAYU]
Well, what about you, huh?

00:19:12.526 --> 00:19:13.444
What?

00:19:13.486 --> 00:19:14.487
Why do you do this?

00:19:14.528 --> 00:19:16.489
Do you have some
meaningful reason?

00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:18.783
No, I don't need a
reason. I'm an arbiter.

00:19:18.824 --> 00:19:20.660
This is what I do.

00:19:22.953 --> 00:19:26.082
Then you arbiters have
my pity. All of you.

00:19:26.123 --> 00:19:27.625
[GINTI]
Pity?

00:19:28.542 --> 00:19:31.462
I decided for myself
how I was going to live.

00:19:31.504 --> 00:19:34.590
Maybe it wasn't a life others
would be super proud of,

00:19:34.632 --> 00:19:37.593
but I devoted it to him
because I wanted to.

00:19:37.635 --> 00:19:40.680
If you ask me, there is
some meaning in that.

00:19:42.473 --> 00:19:44.350
[GINTI]
Wouldn't that be nice?

00:19:55.027 --> 00:19:56.862
[GINTI]
And that's that.

00:20:01.909 --> 00:20:04.954
[gasps] Wait! What's happening?

00:20:04.995 --> 00:20:08.541
No! He lied! Harada!
I'm so sorry!

00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:34.358
[MAYU]
Harada.

00:22:05.032 --> 00:22:07.827
[phone ringing]

00:22:07.868 --> 00:22:10.454
Hello, there.
Information bureau.

00:22:10.496 --> 00:22:12.790
[DECIM]
I have a favor to ask.

00:22:12.832 --> 00:22:14.124
Oh?

00:22:14.166 --> 00:22:19.505
[DECIM] Do you think I
could have you send me

00:22:19.547 --> 00:22:20.881
[QUIN]
It's happening.

00:22:20.923 --> 00:22:23.050
I'm just about to
forward them along.

00:22:23.092 --> 00:22:25.928
[NONA] All right, good.
Thank you, Quin.

00:22:30.307 --> 00:22:31.892
[elevator dings]

00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:34.728
[gasps]

00:22:36.522 --> 00:22:37.982
And where are you going?

00:22:38.023 --> 00:22:40.776
What's it matter
to you, old man?

00:22:40.818 --> 00:22:43.988
[OCULUS] I hope you enjoyed
yourself. Looked like fun.

00:22:44.029 --> 00:22:46.198
Sorry?

00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:48.742
[OCULUS]
You've been bad, Nona.

00:23:14.268 --> 00:23:18.022
