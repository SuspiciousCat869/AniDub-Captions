[YOUSUKE]
So all the doors are locked.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.724
They've sealed us in
here like it's a tomb.

00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:17.851
Who the hell do they
think they are?

00:00:23.649 --> 00:00:25.359
[MISAKI] They've shut down
the elevators, too.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.153
[YOUSUKE] What do you think
they want? Why us?

00:00:28.195 --> 00:00:30.864
[gasps] I've got it!

00:00:30.906 --> 00:00:33.617
[YOUSUKE]
Wait! Where are you taking me?

Hey! This is the ladies room!

[MISAKI] Relax, you're
not my type. C'mon!

[YOUSUKE yelps]

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.960
Um. So why did you
drag me in here?

00:00:43.001 --> 00:00:44.503
[MISAKI]
I know what's going on.

00:00:44.545 --> 00:00:46.380
We're on a hidden camera show!

[YOUSUKE]
What?

00:00:47.923 --> 00:00:50.634
[MISAKI] You watch TV, right?
What's your name, anyway?

00:00:50.676 --> 00:00:52.844
[YOUSUKE]
Uh... Yousuke Tateishi.

00:00:52.886 --> 00:00:55.097
[MISAKI]
And you don't know who I am?

00:00:55.138 --> 00:00:56.473
[YOUSUKE]
Huh?

00:00:56.515 --> 00:00:59.977
Does the name Misaki
Tachibana ring any bells?

00:01:00.018 --> 00:01:02.104
[YOUSUKE]
Misaki, huh?

00:01:05.065 --> 00:01:07.109
[YOUSUKE]
From that reality show?

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:09.820
[MISAKI]
Well, it took you long enough.

00:01:09.861 --> 00:01:11.655
Don't meet many
celebrities, do you?

00:01:11.697 --> 00:01:13.782
Uh. It's just different
seeing you in person.

00:01:13.824 --> 00:01:15.200
[MISAKI]
How so?

00:01:15.242 --> 00:01:16.034
You look younger.

00:01:16.076 --> 00:01:18.036
Are you saying that
I look old on TV?

00:01:18.078 --> 00:01:19.413
[YOUSUKE]
That's not...

00:01:19.454 --> 00:01:20.956
Fine. Whatever.

00:01:20.998 --> 00:01:22.541
So they do lots of
hidden camera shows

00:01:22.583 --> 00:01:25.627
during the summer, right?
That's what this is.

00:01:25.669 --> 00:01:26.253
[YOUSUKE]
Really?

00:01:26.295 --> 00:01:29.631
[MISAKI chuckles]
There's no doubt about it.

00:01:29.673 --> 00:01:32.634
I could tell my manager
was hiding something.

00:01:32.676 --> 00:01:35.262
Okay, but, you're
sure about this?

00:01:35.304 --> 00:01:38.390
That's why I dragged us in here
where there aren't any cameras.

00:01:38.432 --> 00:01:39.808
Uh-huh...

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:41.059
[MISAKI]
And now that we know.

00:01:41.101 --> 00:01:42.769
I need you to
work with me, okay?

00:01:42.811 --> 00:01:45.147
Wait, work with you how?

00:01:45.188 --> 00:01:47.107
[MISAKI sighs] You're not
as bright as you look.

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:49.443
I need you to act like you
don't know what's happening.

00:01:49.484 --> 00:01:51.028
The director will
want our reactions

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:53.155
to seem natural, after all.

00:01:53.196 --> 00:01:56.283
Yeah... I've never
done any acting before.

00:01:56.325 --> 00:01:57.326
You'll be fine!

00:01:57.367 --> 00:01:59.244
I'll quietly coach
you through it.

All right, then.

We should just sit down and
play without any strategies.

realistic approach.

No. This is not a
