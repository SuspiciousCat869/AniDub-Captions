WEBVTT

00:00:08.425 --> 00:00:09.510
There was this guy who had been

00:00:09.551 --> 00:00:13.347
giving her a lot of trouble.
A stalker, you know?

00:00:13.388 --> 00:00:18.977
I even told the police about it.
But they didn't do anything.

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:22.189
I can't let him...
just get away with it.

00:00:22.231 --> 00:00:25.984
[TATSUMI] Revenge, huh?
I know something about that.

00:00:26.026 --> 00:00:27.486
It's what I'm after, too.

00:00:27.528 --> 00:00:28.445
It is?

00:00:28.487 --> 00:00:29.947
I'm sure this isn't
the kinda thing

00:00:29.988 --> 00:00:33.325
that you'd expect to
hear from a detective.

00:00:33.367 --> 00:00:35.827
But when I get outta here...

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:39.456
...somebody is going to die.

00:00:39.498 --> 00:00:44.586
[WOMAN panting]
It wasn't just one of them?

00:00:44.628 --> 00:00:46.755
They're both killers?

00:02:14.843 --> 00:02:18.430
Your wife was murdered?
I'm so sorry!

00:02:18.472 --> 00:02:21.350
Yeah. My attention was
always somewhere else,

00:02:21.391 --> 00:02:26.521
I guess. Sorta comes with the
territory of being a detective.

00:02:26.563 --> 00:02:30.734
That doesn't excuse it.
I should've protected her.

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:36.073
I will protect you.
I promise, whatever it takes.

00:02:40.452 --> 00:02:42.496
So you're looking
for revenge, too.

00:02:42.537 --> 00:02:44.122
[TATSUMI]
Yeah.

00:02:44.164 --> 00:02:45.791
What're you planning
to do to the bastard

00:02:45.832 --> 00:02:47.501
when you find him?

00:02:49.753 --> 00:02:50.671
Well, honestly,

00:02:50.712 --> 00:02:54.132
I wouldn't mind
torturing him, but...

00:02:54.174 --> 00:02:57.594
I think I can settle
for killing him, instead.

00:02:57.636 --> 00:03:00.931
I admire your honesty.
And I agree.

00:03:00.972 --> 00:03:03.392
His death would make
the world a better place.

00:03:03.433 --> 00:03:05.769
Some people need to be put down.

00:03:05.811 --> 00:03:09.398
That's what they're like?
The memories of the dead?

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:12.526
Confusing? A bunch of
scenes jumbled together.

00:03:12.567 --> 00:03:14.403
They can be hard
to make sense of.

00:03:14.444 --> 00:03:15.946
Thus, they are insufficient.

00:03:15.987 --> 00:03:19.157
You can't get a full picture
of someone just from memories.

00:03:20.575 --> 00:03:23.036
So, you're a detective
who endorses murder?

00:03:23.078 --> 00:03:25.247
[TATSUMI]
It's taking out society's trash.

00:03:25.288 --> 00:03:27.958
Most of the cases we handle
in the investigative division

00:03:27.999 --> 00:03:31.044
are so vile, they'd shock
the crap outta ya.

00:03:31.086 --> 00:03:35.090
You ask me, these perps can
barely be considered human.

00:03:35.132 --> 00:03:37.259
I'm not sayin' this
as a detective.

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:41.388
I'm sayin' it as
one human to another.

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:46.309
Killing this guy--it's just
the right thing to do.

00:03:46.351 --> 00:03:47.561

[WOMAN] Come on, Decim.
You should stop it.

00:03:59.573 --> 00:04:00.741
This is how it's done.

00:04:00.782 --> 00:04:03.952
They must expose their souls,
the darkness within.

00:04:03.994 --> 00:04:06.538
And then I pass
judgment upon them.

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:09.708
That's my job. That's what
it is to be an arbiter.

What the hell are you
doing with that thing?

[SHIMADA] I don't understand.
I-I already killed the man.

00:05:08.934 --> 00:05:12.229
I stabbed him!
I did it with this!

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:15.982
I killed him.

00:05:17.108 --> 00:05:21.696
I want them to die for
what they did to me.

00:05:21.738 --> 00:05:23.949
Them? There was more than one?

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.827
There was a man.
He just watched.

00:05:26.868 --> 00:05:28.995
I think they were friends.

experience is?

Hey, Tatsumi! Can you hear me?

Please get up!

The score is currently tied.

Each of you has four points.

If you'll look at the next puck,
you'll notice that it's yours.

00:07:02.339 --> 00:07:04.758
If you score a goal,
the points will be doubled.

00:07:04.799 --> 00:07:06.718
You will reach the
stipulated score.

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:08.887
And, thus, you will be
declared the winner.

the stakes of the game.

that won't be necessary.

I would've done if you...

anymore! I forfeit!

this, then...

You have to finish this guy,
or else he'll just do it again.

keep torturing you.

off like that, are you?

Yes, it is.

Allow me to explain.

tribunal of the soul.

the soul? Quite a name.

[DECIM] Interesting.
You still cannot remember?

00:11:45.455 --> 00:11:47.123
See, Shimada, you've
forgotten something

00:11:47.165 --> 00:11:49.876
pretty important. I'm
guessing you don't remember

00:11:49.918 --> 00:11:51.878
doing this, huh?

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:55.006

You stabbed me.

The world's a cruel,
screwed up place,

00:20:51.542 --> 00:20:52.960
and we have to accept it.

00:20:53.002 --> 00:20:55.337
You can't change
that, nobody can.

00:20:55.379 --> 00:20:59.383
The only thing you
can do is fight back!

00:22:11.497 --> 00:22:19.046
[whimpers] You see, Sae.
I'm gonna do it right this time.

00:22:19.088 --> 00:22:21.173
I'm gonna protect you.

00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:28.013

You don't get it!

00:22:30.391 --> 00:22:34.353
People aren't as complex as
you seem to think they are.

00:22:34.395 --> 00:22:36.939
They're really pretty simple.

00:22:36.981 --> 00:22:40.276
They get sad and angry
over simple things.

00:22:40.317 --> 00:22:43.404
Can you understand that?
People are simple creatures!

00:22:43.445 --> 00:22:45.823
The littlest things
send them spinning,

00:22:45.865 --> 00:22:49.159
and they live never knowing
when they're going to fall.

00:22:51.161 --> 00:22:53.455
That's what being human is!

00:23:14.476 --> 00:23:17.438
