00:00:16.934 --> 00:00:20.521
Huh? Okay, where am I?

00:00:20.562 --> 00:00:24.066
Ooh! Maybe it's a
haunted house? Cool!

00:00:24.107 --> 00:00:28.987
[MAYU laughs] Where are you,
ghosts? Come out and play!

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:30.989
Ghosts, ghosts, ghosts!

00:00:31.031 --> 00:00:34.409
You're here to stay,
so come out and play!

00:00:36.703 --> 00:00:38.080
Huh?

00:00:40.249 --> 00:00:40.916
[GINTI]
Hey.

00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:42.918
[gasps] You talking to me?

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.921
You see anybody
else around here?

00:00:45.963 --> 00:00:48.257
Just sit over there.

00:00:48.298 --> 00:00:50.759
Since you asked nicely.

00:02:13.133 --> 00:02:16.928
[footsteps, rustling]

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.513
Are you a collector?

00:02:18.555 --> 00:02:19.139
Don't touch those!

00:02:19.181 --> 00:02:20.474
[grunts]

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.685
Took your sweet
time gettin' here.

00:02:23.727 --> 00:02:25.979
I'm gonna make the
spiel quick, so listen up.

00:02:26.021 --> 00:02:27.105
You ready?

00:02:27.147 --> 00:02:28.398
[MAYU]
What spiel?

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.941
In a bit, I'm gonna
have you play a game

00:02:29.983 --> 00:02:31.568
against that dude over there.

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.362
[MAYU]
What do you mean "play a game"?

00:02:33.403 --> 00:02:37.240
What's going on? I don't get
the point of this. Do you?

00:02:37.282 --> 00:02:39.451
[MAYU gasps]

00:02:39.493 --> 00:02:41.453
[MAYU]
No way.

00:02:41.495 --> 00:02:42.329
Hey, um.

00:02:42.371 --> 00:02:45.290
I could be totally wrong
about this, but you look like

00:02:45.332 --> 00:02:48.126
Harada from Cross Heart Attack.

00:02:48.168 --> 00:02:49.044
Guilty.

00:02:49.086 --> 00:02:52.673
[MAYU]
No! Freaking! Way!

00:02:52.714 --> 00:02:55.550
[MAYU giggles]
I am your biggest fan!

00:02:55.592 --> 00:02:58.261
I don't know what I'm doing
here, but I don't care!

00:02:58.303 --> 00:02:59.888
Oh, nice to meet you, too.

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.099
I would be so honored
if you'd shake my hand!

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.642
I'm Mayu Arita.

00:03:03.684 --> 00:03:04.643
Sure. No problem.

00:03:04.685 --> 00:03:07.813
[MAYU squeals]

00:03:07.854 --> 00:03:10.107
[HARADA]
What is that?

00:03:10.148 --> 00:03:11.775
And you're the one who
brought us together!

00:03:11.817 --> 00:03:15.529
Thank you! Uh, so,
who are you, anyway?

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:16.780
Name's Ginti.

00:03:16.822 --> 00:03:19.116
[MAYU] Huh? That's
kind of a weird name.

00:03:19.157 --> 00:03:21.159
Are you C. H. A.'s
manager or something?

00:03:21.201 --> 00:03:23.870
[GINTI]
This is gonna be a long shift.

00:03:23.912 --> 00:03:25.831
[GINTI]
Listen, just press this.

00:03:25.872 --> 00:03:27.958
That'll pick what game you play.

00:03:29.084 --> 00:03:30.544
Playing a game with Harada?

00:03:30.585 --> 00:03:33.505
I'm so totally in! Oh, do you
mind if I press the button?

00:03:33.547 --> 00:03:35.006
Well, apparently we
can't leave here

00:03:35.048 --> 00:03:37.217
till we play this
game. So, go ahead.

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:38.593
Here we go!

00:03:40.303 --> 00:03:45.642
[MAYU gasps]
Ooh...

00:03:45.684 --> 00:03:47.644
[game music plays]

00:03:49.396 --> 00:03:52.023
Um, so, what's that?

00:03:52.065 --> 00:03:53.567
Never heard of it.

00:03:53.608 --> 00:03:55.777
All right, follow me.

00:03:58.655 --> 00:04:00.741
Aw, what a cute little kitty!

00:04:00.782 --> 00:04:01.825
[HARADA]
You comin'?

00:04:01.867 --> 00:04:03.201
Oh! Yeah!

00:04:04.786 --> 00:04:07.539
[MAYU] I wonder what this
place is. Do you know?

00:04:07.581 --> 00:04:08.999
[HARADA]
No clue.

00:04:13.837 --> 00:04:16.089
[MAYU]
So, no shows today, huh?

00:04:16.131 --> 00:04:19.384
[HARADA] Nope. I guess
it must be my day off.

00:04:19.426 --> 00:04:21.720
Only, I can't seem to
remember how I got here.

00:04:21.762 --> 00:04:22.637
What about you?

00:04:22.679 --> 00:04:23.847
No, I got nothin'!

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:25.932
Looks like you're
taking it pretty well.

00:04:25.974 --> 00:04:27.350
[MAYU]
I'm here, chatting with Harada.

00:04:27.392 --> 00:04:29.227
Nothing's gonna
ruin that for me.

00:04:29.269 --> 00:04:30.937
[HARADA]
Right...

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:34.733
Ooh! That's huge!

00:04:44.534 --> 00:04:46.703
[GINTI grunts]

00:04:46.745 --> 00:04:48.663
[MAYU] I've got no idea
how to play this.

00:04:48.705 --> 00:04:51.416
Well, gimme a sec. I'll explain.

00:04:51.458 --> 00:04:53.084
Take your socks off
and stand on the edge.

00:04:53.126 --> 00:04:54.795
All right.

00:04:57.672 --> 00:05:00.091
The spinner is gonna
give you your instructions.

00:05:00.133 --> 00:05:01.593
[MAYU]
What spinner?

00:05:01.635 --> 00:05:04.638
This thing up here. It spins.

00:05:08.517 --> 00:05:10.977
[MAYU] The kitty's the
one who controls it?

00:05:11.019 --> 00:05:14.105
[GINTI]
Memine! Call her by her name.

00:05:14.147 --> 00:05:14.856
[MAYU]
Okay.

00:05:14.898 --> 00:05:17.025
Now, back to the instructions.

00:05:17.067 --> 00:05:19.069
Just do what the
spinner tells you to.

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:22.781
Place the selected body part
on the selected circle.

00:05:22.823 --> 00:05:24.866
If you fall or if you
touch the mat beyond

00:05:24.908 --> 00:05:28.495
what's specified,
then, you lose.

00:05:28.537 --> 00:05:30.080
That's it, those are the rules.

00:05:30.121 --> 00:05:31.498
Everybody got it?

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:33.750
Yeah, that sounds
simple enough to me.

00:05:33.792 --> 00:05:35.544

Ladies first, I guess.

You mean we're
starting already?

00:05:46.596 --> 00:05:47.681
That's the idea.

00:05:47.722 --> 00:05:49.599
[MAYU] You're really
grouchy, you know that?

00:05:49.641 --> 00:05:51.142
And my name's Mayu, by the way.

00:05:51.184 --> 00:05:52.519
You could try using it.

00:05:52.561 --> 00:05:54.604

your name is, honey.

watching. Calm down, Mayu!

[MAYU humming]

00:06:49.284 --> 00:06:51.578
[MAYU] I guess you can't
expect a guy not to look.

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:54.956
And considering who it is, it's
not like I'm gonna complain!

00:06:54.998 --> 00:06:57.083
Is there something wrong, Mayu?
It's your turn to move.

00:06:57.125 --> 00:07:00.337
[MAYU] Gah! He said it!
He said my name!

00:07:00.378 --> 00:07:02.923

[HARADA sighs] I guess
I have to play this game,

00:07:11.264 --> 00:07:12.891
but I wish the girl
was a little cuter.

right hand to yellow.

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.354
[HARADA]
She's just too obvious.

of here so I can see Lisa.

Hm.

go on forever and ever!

Okay. I'm getting tired.

Yeah? What do you want?

I need to take a little break.

Why's that?

[MAYU growls]
You get one, so why can't we?

I'm tired, okay? And I
need to use the restroom.

Too bad.

It isn't just me. Harada
wants a break, too.

I could use one.

00:09:15.513 --> 00:09:17.682
It's not gonna happen,
so quit bothering me.

00:09:17.724 --> 00:09:19.642
And there's one more
thing I forgot to say.

00:09:19.684 --> 00:09:22.896
There'll be consequences
for the loser.

00:09:22.937 --> 00:09:25.857
Potentially fatal consequences.

00:09:25.899 --> 00:09:27.817
Is that supposed to be
a joke or something?

00:09:27.859 --> 00:09:29.736
'Cause it's not very funny.

00:09:29.778 --> 00:09:34.157
[GINTI] A cruel joke, I guess
you could call it. See this?

00:09:34.199 --> 00:09:35.784
What is it?

kidding around?

hell is going on here?

of the actual game.

have a lovely time.

[GINTI] There. Took a while,
but we've finally

reached the entertaining
part. Pathetic humans.

in front of Harada.

I'm so happy. This is
a dream come true.

Ever since that first concert,
I've been your biggest fan.

I went to your shows
and bought your posters.

I even sent you fan mail.
A lot of fan mail.

Whenever things got tough,
or I was having a bad day,

I would listen to your songs,
and they would cheer me up.

00:16:02.879 --> 00:16:06.716
Well, anyway. I guess what
I'm saying is, thanks.

Thanks, Harada, for
always being there.

couldn't have kept going.

[MAYU] I know people always
called you a womanizer.

But I never cared
about any of that.

special. That's how you are.

please don't forget me.

dancing and everything.

out. Right, Mayu?

It's because of them that
I've come so far in my life.

It's because of you, Mayu!

something as basic as that?
