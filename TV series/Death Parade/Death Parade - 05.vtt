00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:24.274
[MOTHER 5A] To his delight,
Jimmy's family had moved

00:00:24.316 --> 00:00:26.360
into a new home that winter.

00:00:26.401 --> 00:00:29.696
The new house was filled
with fun toys just for him.

00:00:29.738 --> 00:00:33.367
Jimmy couldn't be more thrilled!

00:00:33.408 --> 00:00:35.869
Jimmy peered outside
to look at the snow,

00:00:35.911 --> 00:00:38.163
and do you know what he saw?

00:00:38.205 --> 00:00:41.208
There was a girl about
his age playing on the ice

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.752
with a cute little puppy.

00:00:43.794 --> 00:00:46.255
Jimmy didn't need to
talk to the girl first.

00:00:46.296 --> 00:00:48.882
He knew right away
that he would like her.

00:00:48.924 --> 00:00:53.595
Her big smile promised
instant friendship.

00:00:53.637 --> 00:00:55.264
Jimmy finally worked
up his courage

00:00:55.305 --> 00:00:56.974
and called out to the girl.

00:00:57.015 --> 00:00:59.685
When he spoke, she looked
in his direction and waved,

00:00:59.726 --> 00:01:05.399
as if to say, "Come over here!
Come and play with me!"

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.236
Excited, Jimmy started
running toward her.

00:01:09.278 --> 00:01:10.737
Poor Jimmy!

00:01:10.779 --> 00:01:12.322
He didn't realize
there was a hole

00:01:12.364 --> 00:01:15.200
hidden by the blanket
of fallen snow.

00:01:15.242 --> 00:01:17.119
"Ow, that hurt!

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.748
Wah!" Jimmy began crying
out of pain and surprise.

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:23.959
But just then,
a hand reached down

00:01:23.959 --> 00:01:26.378
to help Jimmy. It was
the little girl!

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.839
He looked up and saw
her big, friendly smile,

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.966
and he forgot all
about the pain.

00:01:31.008 --> 00:01:33.760
His new friend had
come to the rescue.

00:01:33.802 --> 00:01:35.178
[WOMAN gasps]

00:01:41.059 --> 00:01:43.854
I wonder why I keep
having that dream.

[yawns]

00:03:25.414 --> 00:03:26.790
Huh?

00:03:30.752 --> 00:03:33.171
Weird. Has that
always been there?

[DECIM]
How are you doing this morning?

00:03:47.227 --> 00:03:48.729
I'm all right, thanks.

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:51.022
Are you sure? You seem troubled.

00:03:51.064 --> 00:03:53.191
I just had another
strange dream.

00:03:53.233 --> 00:03:55.026
[DECIM]
Is that right?

00:03:55.068 --> 00:03:57.154
What could it mean?

00:03:57.195 --> 00:03:58.864
Who knows?

00:03:58.905 --> 00:04:03.994
[gasps] What's that?
Why're you putting it up?

00:04:04.035 --> 00:04:05.620
I couldn't tell you.

00:04:05.662 --> 00:04:08.373
Nona told me to switch it out,
but didn't explain why.

00:04:15.172 --> 00:04:17.048
Not much. They should
be here soon.

Oh, okay.

[DECIM]
Yes.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.686
However, there is no need
for you to go greet them.

Really? Why not?

00:04:32.564 --> 00:04:35.901

Welcome to the

will be your bartender.

Now then.

You will likely find this
a strange question,

and I'm sorry to be abrupt,
but I'm afraid I must ask.

Do you remember anything at all

00:05:42.175 --> 00:05:44.386
from just prior to
your arrival here?

like I've seen you before.

Yeah.

And ya know, if feels like
I've been here before, too.

It's all kinda fuzzy, though.
I can't remember any details.

Has it been that long already?

You've put in a lot
of hours, huh?

You might try remembering
that the next time

00:06:56.166 --> 00:06:57.959

It's a record of our scores.

notice that we've played

about 170 per year.

how many losses I have?

win more, then?

it easy, not even once.

You know, I had a
sneakin' suspicion

that this was how
it was gonna end.

00:08:13.743 --> 00:08:15.704
[NONA]
That was intentional.

00:10:21.329 --> 00:10:22.705
Man, at this rate when will I

00:10:22.747 --> 00:10:25.041
ever be able to
turn things around?

00:10:25.083 --> 00:10:28.878
[NONA] Heh. Maybe you
should go ask God.

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:31.881
If you'll excuse us.

00:10:31.923 --> 00:10:33.341
[OCULUS]
I'm afraid God has been

00:10:33.383 --> 00:10:36.511
gone for a long time now.

00:10:36.553 --> 00:10:38.638
[MAN 5A]
Let me outta here, right now!

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:40.265
You wouldn't want the kid
to get hurt, would ya?

00:10:40.306 --> 00:10:43.143
[BOY whimpers]

00:10:44.644 --> 00:10:46.938
[DECIM]
Easy. Let's talk a moment.

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:47.939
About what?

00:10:47.981 --> 00:10:49.357
Please bear with me.

00:10:49.399 --> 00:10:51.901
Have you ever heard the story
"The Spider's Thread"?

00:10:51.943 --> 00:10:54.904
[MAN 5A] What? Why bring
up that old tale?

00:10:57.991 --> 00:10:59.868
What's going on here?

00:10:59.909 --> 00:11:02.328
[DECIM]
Kandata is languishing in Hell.

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:05.123
But the Buddha dangles a
spider's thread down to him.

00:11:05.165 --> 00:11:09.419
He does so because, just once,
Kandata spared a spider's life.

00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:12.088
Kandata, who has long
dreamt of Paradise,

00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:14.007
begins climbing up the thread.

00:11:14.048 --> 00:11:17.844
However, many other sinners
soon follow after him.

00:11:17.886 --> 00:11:20.138
Kandata fears that the
thread is going to break,

00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:22.599
and so he seeks to shake
the others from it.

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:24.601
Who cares about your damn story?

00:11:24.642 --> 00:11:26.936
Do you even get
what's going on here?

00:11:26.978 --> 00:11:29.314
What would have been better
is if they'd been kept

00:11:29.355 --> 00:11:31.316
from seeing the thread
in the first place.

00:11:31.357 --> 00:11:33.276
Shut up, you freak!

00:11:34.903 --> 00:11:35.820
[MAN 5A gasps]

00:11:35.862 --> 00:11:37.655
[DECIM]
Much better.

00:11:37.697 --> 00:11:42.869
[MAN 5A groans]

00:11:46.331 --> 00:11:47.624
Are you okay?

00:11:47.665 --> 00:11:51.085
Not again! Damn it, not again!

00:11:51.127 --> 00:11:54.714
I am terribly sorry, sir.
I hate to be so rough.

00:11:54.756 --> 00:11:57.800
But really, you must allow
me to speak with you.

00:11:57.842 --> 00:12:00.386
Let me out of this, or... I'll--

Oh, whoops.

[DECIM]
Ah--

[DECIM gasps]

00:12:35.088 --> 00:12:37.131
You're no normal little boy.

00:12:37.173 --> 00:12:40.760
[BOY chuckles] You still
haven't figured it out?

00:12:40.802 --> 00:12:43.137
That's pretty pathetic, Decim.

00:12:43.179 --> 00:12:44.430
[DECIM gasps]

00:12:49.978 --> 00:12:52.522
Ugh! Didn't see that coming!

00:13:01.239 --> 00:13:03.741
All I did was put her to sleep.

00:13:03.783 --> 00:13:06.286
[voice deepening] Is she really
that important to you?

00:13:06.327 --> 00:13:08.121
Interesting.

00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:23.219
It's been a long
time, hasn't it?

00:13:23.261 --> 00:13:25.596
Hello again, Ginti.

00:13:26.931 --> 00:13:28.182
[GINTI]
That's the guest you were unable

00:13:28.224 --> 00:13:30.101
to pass judgment on, right?

00:13:30.143 --> 00:13:30.810
[DECIM]
Yes.

00:13:30.852 --> 00:13:33.271
What happened there?

00:13:33.313 --> 00:13:35.773
[DECIM]
It was an unusual situation.

00:13:35.815 --> 00:13:37.233
When she came to
Quindecim, she could

00:13:37.275 --> 00:13:40.069
remember that she was dead.

00:13:40.111 --> 00:13:43.281
Yeah, that is weird.
Never heard of that happening.

00:13:43.323 --> 00:13:44.574
As you might imagine,

00:13:44.615 --> 00:13:46.409
I was therefore unable
to prompt her to play

00:13:46.451 --> 00:13:48.328
the required game.

00:13:48.369 --> 00:13:50.204
Ultimately, I wound up
having her memories

00:13:50.246 --> 00:13:53.541
erased and her judgment
period extended.

00:13:53.583 --> 00:13:56.419
[GINTI] So, have her memories
of being human returned?

00:13:56.461 --> 00:13:58.171
No, they have not yet come back.

00:13:58.212 --> 00:13:59.255
[GINTI]
Really?

00:13:59.297 --> 00:14:01.924
Then what the hell is
she doing here with you?

00:14:01.966 --> 00:14:04.677
She is assisting me
with my judgments.

00:14:04.719 --> 00:14:08.639
[gasps] A human? Are you
screwing with me?

00:14:12.101 --> 00:14:14.812
A human? Are you
out of your mind?

00:14:14.854 --> 00:14:15.730
You've gotta be.

00:14:15.772 --> 00:14:17.023
It's not crazy.

00:14:17.065 --> 00:14:20.526
I have respect for people who
have lived a fulfilling life.

00:14:20.568 --> 00:14:23.488
Additionally, her
observations are astute

00:14:23.529 --> 00:14:26.157
and her opinions, fresh.

00:14:26.199 --> 00:14:28.409
Frankly, I find her fascinating.

00:14:28.451 --> 00:14:29.994
[GINTI] You say that
with a straight face,

00:14:30.036 --> 00:14:32.163
like it's totally normal.

00:14:32.205 --> 00:14:34.707
Am I gonna have to beat
some sense into you?

00:14:45.802 --> 00:14:47.136
[GINTI]
Let's go!

00:14:57.230 --> 00:15:00.191
[DECIM]
We can keep going if you'd like.

00:15:00.233 --> 00:15:02.402
You've changed,
and I think I like it.

00:15:02.443 --> 00:15:05.780
I'm happy to keep
playin' if you are!

00:15:05.822 --> 00:15:09.450
But if you think you're gonna
beat me... you're crazy!

00:15:09.492 --> 00:15:12.954
[groans]

00:15:12.995 --> 00:15:14.163
Stop it!

00:15:14.205 --> 00:15:16.707
Don't-- [groans]

00:15:16.749 --> 00:15:19.460
[NONA] Too far! I didn't give
you permission for this.

00:15:19.502 --> 00:15:22.004
Oh-ho! This place is destroyed.

00:15:22.046 --> 00:15:24.006
You insisted on doing
this, so I let you,

00:15:24.048 --> 00:15:25.716
but now you're making
me regret it.

00:15:25.758 --> 00:15:27.844
[GINTI]
Can't move.

00:15:27.885 --> 00:15:29.011
It's been too long.

00:15:29.053 --> 00:15:31.848
I hope you are doing
well, and you, Clavis.

00:15:31.889 --> 00:15:33.975
Hangin' in there,
thanks. Good to see ya.

[NONA]
You're fighting this moron?

00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:39.021
What's gotten into you?
You never rise to Ginti's bait.

00:15:39.063 --> 00:15:40.773
Moron?

00:15:40.815 --> 00:15:45.027
True. I am usually immune.

00:15:45.069 --> 00:15:46.779
Well, we'll let it go for now.

00:15:46.821 --> 00:15:49.240
So. Can you guess
what I'm doing here?

00:15:49.282 --> 00:15:50.158
[DECIM]
Uh.

00:15:50.199 --> 00:15:52.910
[NONA] Do you know anything
about Quin's memory test?

00:15:52.952 --> 00:15:55.079
I've heard of it,
but I don't know much.

00:15:55.121 --> 00:15:57.165
Is that what this
is supposed to be?

00:15:57.206 --> 00:16:00.626
Yep. Honestly, totally
hopeless, aren't you?

00:16:00.668 --> 00:16:02.086
[laughs]

00:16:02.128 --> 00:16:03.754
[NONA]
Shut up, moron.

00:16:03.796 --> 00:16:06.716
[laughs]

00:16:06.757 --> 00:16:08.342
[GINTI]
Little weasel!

00:16:09.469 --> 00:16:12.263
[NONA] You paid too much
attention to the decoy.

00:16:12.305 --> 00:16:13.514
Yes, ma'am.

00:16:13.556 --> 00:16:16.934
What's supposed to happen
prior to our guests' arrival?

00:16:16.976 --> 00:16:18.603
The information
bureau edits down

00:16:18.644 --> 00:16:20.730
and compiles their memories,

00:16:20.771 --> 00:16:22.482
which are sent to the
arbiters for review

00:16:22.523 --> 00:16:25.485
before the game begins.

00:16:25.526 --> 00:16:27.653
The memory compilations
are one of the bases

00:16:27.695 --> 00:16:29.405
for our judgments.

00:16:29.447 --> 00:16:31.324
[NONA] And today was
different because...

00:16:31.365 --> 00:16:33.159
Today was different
because the boy's memories

00:16:33.201 --> 00:16:34.452
were not sent.

00:16:34.494 --> 00:16:35.453
[NONA]
Continue.

00:16:35.495 --> 00:16:38.122
Initially, at least,
I was on my guard.

00:16:38.164 --> 00:16:39.457
But then there was that man.

00:16:39.499 --> 00:16:41.334
Because of him, your
attention was diverted.

00:16:41.375 --> 00:16:42.376
That's correct.

00:16:42.418 --> 00:16:43.294
Pitiful!

00:16:43.336 --> 00:16:46.172
There's no such thing as a
human being with no memories!

00:16:46.214 --> 00:16:48.591
The shock of dying makes
things hazy for a bit,

00:16:48.633 --> 00:16:51.385
but their latent memories
don't vanish into thin air.

00:16:51.427 --> 00:16:52.470
Yes, ma'am.

00:16:52.512 --> 00:16:54.096
Testing the arbiters
in such a manner

00:16:54.138 --> 00:16:56.641
is often necessary.
Do you know why?

00:16:56.682 --> 00:16:57.558
No.

00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:59.227
You draw out the
darkness in their souls

00:16:59.268 --> 00:17:02.104
as much as possible.
Then you make your judgment.

00:17:02.146 --> 00:17:04.649
To do that, you must
create extreme conditions,

00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:08.486
and that requires intimate
knowledge of your guests' lives.

00:17:13.115 --> 00:17:15.117
What is it?

00:17:15.159 --> 00:17:18.120
[DECIM] Nothing. I'm
sorry for my mistake.

00:17:20.831 --> 00:17:23.000
[NONA] To sum up, if the
memories aren't sent to you,

00:17:23.042 --> 00:17:25.002
cancel the game. End of story.

00:17:25.044 --> 00:17:26.254
Yes, ma'am.

00:17:26.295 --> 00:17:28.464
You can get up now,
sleeping beauty.

00:17:29.757 --> 00:17:31.175
[gasps]

00:17:31.217 --> 00:17:33.844
[NONA] I'm finished here.
Get the elevator.

00:17:33.886 --> 00:17:35.388
[CLAVIS]
I've already called it.

00:17:37.014 --> 00:17:38.307
[DECIM]
One more thing.

00:17:38.349 --> 00:17:40.351
[NONA]
Hmm? What is it now?

00:17:40.393 --> 00:17:42.311
What shall I do
with this gentleman?

00:17:42.353 --> 00:17:43.646
[NONA]
That's just a dummy with some

00:17:43.688 --> 00:17:47.191
fuzzy memories implanted.
It's not human.

00:17:47.233 --> 00:17:48.901
[DECIM]
That makes sense.

00:17:48.943 --> 00:17:51.028
Well, carry on, you three.

00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:53.281
[CLAVIS]
Will do!

00:17:53.322 --> 00:17:54.907
Tch.

00:17:54.949 --> 00:17:56.742
Well, Ginti.

00:17:56.784 --> 00:17:58.995
Was there something else you
wanted to talk to me about?

00:17:59.036 --> 00:18:00.913
--[GINTI] Huh?
--[CLAVIS chuckles]

00:18:00.955 --> 00:18:03.082
You're one stupid,
stone-cold bastard,

00:18:03.124 --> 00:18:04.709
you know that?

00:18:26.188 --> 00:18:28.065
[CASTRA]
Uh-oh.

00:18:28.107 --> 00:18:30.651
Your boy didn't do
too well, I take it?

00:18:30.693 --> 00:18:33.279
How very perceptive
of you, Castra.

00:18:33.321 --> 00:18:35.740
Quin's little test with
the memories, right?

00:18:35.781 --> 00:18:38.200
And how many years has
he been an arbiter now?

00:18:38.242 --> 00:18:39.493
It's been five years.

00:18:39.535 --> 00:18:42.204
Say what you want, I still
prefer him to that moron.

00:18:42.246 --> 00:18:45.416
You're talking
about Ginti, right?

00:18:45.458 --> 00:18:46.542
What can I say?

00:18:46.584 --> 00:18:49.754
I'm a sucker for men
who are pretty and dumb.

00:18:49.795 --> 00:18:51.631
[NONA]
So, what's the situation?

00:18:51.672 --> 00:18:53.507
[CASTRA]
Oh, you know. Same as always.

00:18:53.549 --> 00:18:55.092
They're dying too fast.

00:18:55.134 --> 00:18:57.011
We're talking 7,000
an hour, here.

00:18:57.053 --> 00:18:59.388
The righteous just can't seem
to stop killing each other.

00:18:59.430 --> 00:19:01.849
You'd think that
they'd lose interest.

00:19:01.891 --> 00:19:03.267
[NONA]
Yeah, right.

00:19:03.309 --> 00:19:06.729
I know Information's swamped,
but they're not the only ones.

00:19:06.771 --> 00:19:09.774
Maybe you could put a word
in to Oculus for me?

00:19:09.815 --> 00:19:11.609
[NONA]
I'll see what I can do.

00:19:13.486 --> 00:19:15.946
The trick is to find ways
to alleviate the boredom

00:19:15.988 --> 00:19:17.490
for a little bit.

00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:21.744
[NONA]
Sometimes he irritates me.

00:19:21.786 --> 00:19:25.122
There's laid back and then
there's just plain lazy.

00:19:26.248 --> 00:19:29.126
What do you think I wanna
talk to you about, huh?

00:19:29.168 --> 00:19:31.379
Judge that woman,
and do it right now!

00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:33.255
An arbiter and a human
can't work together.

00:19:33.297 --> 00:19:35.675
It's not possible!

00:19:35.716 --> 00:19:37.051
Let it go, Ginti.

00:19:37.093 --> 00:19:39.804
Decim is supposed to handle
this situation on his own.

00:19:39.845 --> 00:19:42.932
Nona says so, and you don't
wanna go against her, do you?

00:19:42.973 --> 00:19:45.309
[GINTI]
Come on, man, don't you get it?

00:19:45.351 --> 00:19:48.646
Just looking at this idiot
makes me wanna punch something!

00:19:48.688 --> 00:19:50.981
[CLAVIS] There's no reason
for us to get involved here.

00:19:51.023 --> 00:19:54.068
Decim can pass judgment
however he wants.

00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:57.697
Anyway, don't you have guests
coming? Let's get going.

00:19:58.698 --> 00:20:00.866
Fine, I'm coming.

00:20:00.908 --> 00:20:03.619
And for me? Do I
have any guests?

00:20:03.661 --> 00:20:06.288
[CLAVIS] You've got the
day off, you lucky dog.

00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:07.498
See ya later.

00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:09.709
Thank you very much, Clavis.

00:20:30.771 --> 00:20:33.232
[MOTHER 5A] "Let's play!"
said Jimmy to the little girl.

00:20:33.274 --> 00:20:36.444
"It'll be fun!" But the little
girl just smiled at him

00:20:36.485 --> 00:20:40.322
and didn't say anything back.
You see, the girl couldn't hear,

00:20:40.364 --> 00:20:42.575
so she didn't know
what Jimmy had said.

00:20:42.616 --> 00:20:44.452
Jimmy wanted to
explain what he meant

00:20:44.493 --> 00:20:48.789
without using words, so he
ran, and he fell down,

00:20:48.831 --> 00:20:52.626
and he played in the
snow, and he laughed.

00:20:52.668 --> 00:20:55.588
And pretty soon,
the girl joined in, too.

00:20:55.629 --> 00:20:57.882
Jimmy was very, very happy.

00:20:57.923 --> 00:21:00.301
He didn't know her
name, but even so,

00:21:00.342 --> 00:21:03.137
he knew that the two of them
would be good friends.

00:21:03.179 --> 00:21:05.931
Nothing could change that!

00:21:05.973 --> 00:21:06.849
That evening,

00:21:06.891 --> 00:21:09.852
Jimmy told his mom about how
he had played with the girl.

00:21:09.894 --> 00:21:12.438
Jimmy's mom listened to
everything he had to say,

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:15.941
and then she told him that
the girl's name was Chavvot.

00:21:15.983 --> 00:21:19.361
Jimmy slowly sipped his
big mug of hot cocoa,

00:21:19.403 --> 00:21:22.907
and as he did, he said
"Chavvot, Chavvot"

00:21:22.948 --> 00:21:25.075
over and over again.

00:21:25.117 --> 00:21:27.912
"Someday I'll be able
to tell her how I feel.

00:21:27.953 --> 00:21:31.957
Someday" he promised the bright
stars in the winter sky.

00:21:31.999 --> 00:21:33.459
[WOMAN gasps]

00:21:36.337 --> 00:21:39.340
[WOMAN]
Wha--? Huh? That's strange.

00:21:39.381 --> 00:21:41.926
I don't remember falling asleep.

00:21:41.967 --> 00:21:45.137
[yawns]
