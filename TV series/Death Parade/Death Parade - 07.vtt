00:00:16.391 --> 00:00:17.559
[OCULUS]
Number One:

00:00:17.601 --> 00:00:20.020
Arbiters cannot stop
making judgments,

00:00:20.062 --> 00:00:22.231
for this task is
more than their job.

00:00:22.272 --> 00:00:26.360
It's the entire reason
for their existence.

00:00:26.401 --> 00:00:27.611
Number Two:

00:00:27.653 --> 00:00:30.322
Arbiters cannot
experience death,

00:00:30.364 --> 00:00:31.907
for that would taint
their judgments.

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.911
It would make them too
close to being human.

00:00:35.953 --> 00:00:37.955
Number Three:

00:00:37.996 --> 00:00:39.998
Arbiters cannot feel emotions,

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.043
for doing so is not
in their natures.

00:00:43.085 --> 00:00:46.755
It's impossible for a dummy
to have feelings, after all.

00:02:13.008 --> 00:02:14.301
[WOMAN gasps]

00:02:17.846 --> 00:02:21.767
[sighs] That same dream,
over and over.

00:02:21.808 --> 00:02:25.687
[yawns]

00:02:27.272 --> 00:02:30.317
[NOVEM]
Not being able to judge someone?

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:33.028
[GINTI] Yeah, that's
right. Ever happened?

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:34.529
No.

00:02:36.448 --> 00:02:38.992
Never to me.

00:02:39.034 --> 00:02:41.286
Uh...

00:02:41.328 --> 00:02:43.538
What is it?

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.875
Nothing. Just forget
about it, okay?

00:02:54.424 --> 00:02:55.717
Tch.

00:03:07.437 --> 00:03:09.648
[growls]

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.275
[train horn blows]

00:03:16.613 --> 00:03:19.116
[WOMAN sighs]

00:03:23.995 --> 00:03:25.205
Huh?

00:03:27.791 --> 00:03:28.875
[WOMAN]
What's that?

00:03:28.917 --> 00:03:32.379
All the other books around
here are about booze.

00:03:32.421 --> 00:03:34.089
This one's different.

00:03:41.388 --> 00:03:42.848
[WOMAN gasps]

00:04:12.043 --> 00:04:15.005
Wow, Quin. Looking pretty beat.

00:04:15.046 --> 00:04:17.340
Yeah, and it's
all thanks to you.

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.016
[WOMAN gasps]

00:04:27.934 --> 00:04:31.688
Just like the guests.
I'm dead, too.

00:04:32.773 --> 00:04:34.191
[WOMAN gasps]

00:04:45.285 --> 00:04:48.330
Good morning. I hope
you slept well.

00:04:48.371 --> 00:04:51.875
I'll have a warm meal
ready for us to eat shortly.

00:04:51.917 --> 00:04:54.628
[WOMAN]
Decim. Whose is this?

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:58.715
Sorry, but I do not know that.

00:05:00.634 --> 00:05:02.344
Listen, I...

00:05:03.762 --> 00:05:05.722
[WOMAN]
I was wondering...

00:05:05.764 --> 00:05:07.057
Huh?

00:05:10.227 --> 00:05:11.853
Oh, never mind.

00:05:11.895 --> 00:05:13.897
I'm sorry I couldn't help.

00:05:20.612 --> 00:05:21.822
[DECIM]
Now that I think about it.

00:05:21.863 --> 00:05:24.658
It's possible that
Quin left it here.

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:27.410
Huh? Who's Quin?

00:05:27.452 --> 00:05:31.665
Quindecim's former arbiter.
I guess you haven't met her yet.

00:05:31.706 --> 00:05:33.542
The former you?

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:42.634
[elevator dings]

00:05:42.676 --> 00:05:45.136
Sorry if you've
been waiting long.

00:05:45.178 --> 00:05:46.263
Please step in.

00:05:46.304 --> 00:05:47.931
Thank you, Clavis.

00:05:47.973 --> 00:05:49.724
So, where are we
headed to today?

00:05:49.766 --> 00:05:51.434
We're going to the Quindecim.

00:05:51.476 --> 00:05:53.061
All righty.

00:05:57.732 --> 00:06:00.443
Starting tomorrow, you will
officially be Decim.

00:06:00.485 --> 00:06:02.362
I am at your disposal, ma'am.

00:06:02.404 --> 00:06:05.699
[GINTI] The 15th floor,
is it? Pretty low, huh?

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:08.451
Haven't I told you that has
nothing to do with anything?

00:06:08.493 --> 00:06:10.954
But you're all the
way up on the 90th.

00:06:10.996 --> 00:06:12.664
Yeah, of course I am.

00:06:12.706 --> 00:06:15.208
I'm in charge of this
whole tower, after all.

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:16.418
[CLAVIS chuckles]

00:06:16.459 --> 00:06:18.920
Hey, Chuckles. What are
you laughin' about?

00:06:18.962 --> 00:06:21.423
Last I checked, you're
on the 20th floor.

00:06:21.464 --> 00:06:24.050
That's not much of
a difference, is it?

00:06:24.092 --> 00:06:25.802
[GINTI]
Nobody asked you!

00:06:28.096 --> 00:06:31.057
Let me introduce the
two of you. This is Quin.

00:06:31.099 --> 00:06:32.559
It's nice to meet you.

00:06:32.601 --> 00:06:34.811
Which one of them is
going to be Decim?

00:06:34.853 --> 00:06:36.438
This white-haired one.

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:38.023
Do you like to drink?

00:06:38.064 --> 00:06:39.024
Uh...

00:06:39.065 --> 00:06:39.608
See that?

00:06:39.649 --> 00:06:42.777
That's my liquor, and I'm
giving every last drop to you!

00:06:42.819 --> 00:06:45.447
That's right, I'm finally
done being an arbiter!

00:06:45.488 --> 00:06:47.240
What a freakin' relief!

00:06:47.282 --> 00:06:51.119
[laughs] I'm not cut out
for this crap, ya know?

00:06:51.161 --> 00:06:52.245
Looks like I've been transferred

00:06:52.287 --> 00:06:54.080
to the information bureau,
but they provide

00:06:54.122 --> 00:06:56.791
all the booze there,
so you're welcome to mine.

00:06:56.833 --> 00:06:58.501
Oh, and one more thing.

00:06:58.543 --> 00:07:01.713
[GINTI grunts] Doesn't know
how to shut up, does she?

00:07:01.755 --> 00:07:03.590
Don't be such a jerk about it.

00:07:03.632 --> 00:07:07.719
She just likes to talk.
Now, take these.

00:07:07.761 --> 00:07:09.471
Time for the fun part.

00:07:09.512 --> 00:07:11.681
Thank you very much, ma'am.

00:07:11.723 --> 00:07:13.600
[NONA]
Tomorrow, that'll be you boys.

00:07:13.642 --> 00:07:17.062
You'll be the arbiters.
Consider this your final exam.

00:07:17.103 --> 00:07:18.897
By pressing the buttons
on those babies,

00:07:18.939 --> 00:07:21.441
you can make the balls miss,
which will in turn,

00:07:21.483 --> 00:07:23.610
create an extreme condition.

00:07:23.652 --> 00:07:24.653
[GINTI]
Got it.

00:07:24.694 --> 00:07:25.737
[DECIM]
Right.

00:08:32.804 --> 00:08:36.224
Thank you for playing.
Best of luck on your journey.

00:08:42.188 --> 00:08:45.191
[QUIN]
Glasses up, everyone! Cheers!

00:08:49.195 --> 00:08:51.114
Wow! That's amazing!

00:08:51.156 --> 00:08:54.451
You've got some serious
martini-making skills, man.

00:08:54.492 --> 00:08:56.703
I feel much better about
entrusting my bar to you

00:08:56.745 --> 00:08:58.913
after tasting this.

00:08:58.955 --> 00:09:00.999
Good on ya!

00:09:01.041 --> 00:09:03.209
That's kind of you
to say, thank you.

00:09:03.251 --> 00:09:05.378
He's absolutely a
perfect fit to take over

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:07.630
as arbiter here,
don't you think?

00:09:07.672 --> 00:09:09.799
He can certainly make
a drink, I'll give you that.

00:09:09.841 --> 00:09:11.134
[QUIN]
Fill me up!

00:09:11.176 --> 00:09:13.845
[DECIM]
Of course. Right away.

00:09:13.887 --> 00:09:17.182
[NONA]
So, why didn't you ever use it?

00:09:18.308 --> 00:09:20.268
I'm sorry. Use what?

00:09:24.064 --> 00:09:27.150
My sincerest apologies.
I completely forgot.

00:09:27.192 --> 00:09:28.902
[GINTI, NONA, QUIN]
Huh?

00:09:28.943 --> 00:09:31.237
Perhaps it sounds odd,
but I was distracted

00:09:31.279 --> 00:09:32.864
while watching them
play the game.

00:09:32.906 --> 00:09:36.409
I couldn't help but wonder
what they were thinking.

00:09:36.451 --> 00:09:38.703
What are you even talking about?

00:09:38.745 --> 00:09:40.371
Humans are complete
and utter idiots.

00:09:40.413 --> 00:09:41.706
You know that, right?

00:09:41.748 --> 00:09:43.166
Who gives a crap
what they're thinkin'?

00:09:43.208 --> 00:09:45.627
It's not like it
actually matters to us.

00:09:45.668 --> 00:09:48.004
We create extreme
conditions then sit back

00:09:48.046 --> 00:09:50.507
and enjoy while they make
fools of themselves.

00:09:50.548 --> 00:09:53.259
I disagree. I don't
see them as foolish.

00:09:53.301 --> 00:09:54.761
Really?

00:09:54.803 --> 00:09:57.388
That is correct. You see,
I have respect for people

00:09:57.430 --> 00:10:00.100
who have lived a
fulfilling life.

00:10:00.141 --> 00:10:02.519
[QUIN] Well, this one's
a little different.

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:03.895
[gasps]

00:10:06.231 --> 00:10:08.441
[GINTI] Man, you're a
real idiot. Seriously!

00:10:08.483 --> 00:10:10.693
If you ask me, you're--

00:10:10.735 --> 00:10:12.904
Be quiet for a second, okay?

00:10:12.946 --> 00:10:14.948
So, just by looking at
them, could you guess

00:10:14.989 --> 00:10:15.824
what they were thinking?

00:10:15.865 --> 00:10:19.202
No. I wasn't able
to do that, ma'am.

00:10:20.286 --> 00:10:22.038
[NONA] Well, of course
you weren't able to.

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:24.582
You don't have the
experience for it.

00:10:24.624 --> 00:10:26.000
Which is why I
told you to create

00:10:26.042 --> 00:10:30.171
an extreme condition, by doing
so, you force the darkness

00:10:30.213 --> 00:10:32.966
they harbor inside their
souls out into the light,

00:10:33.007 --> 00:10:35.051
making it easier to judge them.

00:10:35.093 --> 00:10:36.594
All right.

00:10:36.636 --> 00:10:39.472
[NONA] The darkness of the soul
can take on many forms.

00:10:39.514 --> 00:10:41.224
It can manifest as
the fear of death

00:10:41.266 --> 00:10:43.643
or as a desperate
thirst for life.

00:10:43.685 --> 00:10:45.687
Think of it as
foolish if you like.

00:10:45.728 --> 00:10:50.108
Or respect it. Either way,
it's entirely up to you.

00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:51.693
Every arbiter is different.

00:10:51.734 --> 00:10:53.403
There should be more
than one way to judge.

00:10:53.444 --> 00:10:55.446
At least in my opinion.

00:10:57.282 --> 00:10:58.616
[clapping]

00:10:58.658 --> 00:11:00.076
Well, anyway!

00:11:00.118 --> 00:11:02.287
It looks like it's time
for my going away speech.

00:11:02.328 --> 00:11:05.206
I do have one or two words
of wisdom to pass on.

00:11:05.248 --> 00:11:07.750
As an old, experienced arbiter.

00:11:07.792 --> 00:11:10.545
It doesn't matter what
it is, but make something

00:11:10.587 --> 00:11:12.088
that you can treasure.

00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:12.714
[GINTI]
Tch...

00:11:12.755 --> 00:11:15.425
Right. Thank you for the advice.

00:11:19.345 --> 00:11:21.723
[WOMAN] Oh, yeah?
Something you can treasure?

00:11:21.764 --> 00:11:22.974
Yes.

00:11:23.016 --> 00:11:24.893
Well, do you have something?

00:11:30.315 --> 00:11:32.567
I can show you
if you would like.

00:12:24.994 --> 00:12:26.955
[DECIM]
Well, what do you think?

00:12:26.996 --> 00:12:28.539
Uh...

00:12:28.581 --> 00:12:30.541
[WOMAN]
These are what he treasures?

00:12:30.583 --> 00:12:34.879
Really? How am I supposed
to respond to this?

00:12:34.921 --> 00:12:38.508
I gotta say something, but what?

00:12:38.549 --> 00:12:42.720
[WOMAN]
So, um, do you enjoy this, then?

00:12:42.762 --> 00:12:43.471
[DECIM]
Sorry?

00:12:43.513 --> 00:12:46.683
[WOMAN] I mean, this
is your hobby, right?

00:12:46.724 --> 00:12:47.934
[DECIM]
Hobby?

00:12:47.976 --> 00:12:49.852
[WOMAN]
It's not?

00:12:49.894 --> 00:12:53.398
You mean my work for
Nona? No, it isn't.

00:12:53.439 --> 00:12:55.942
[WOMAN] But it is something
you treasure, right?

00:12:55.984 --> 00:12:57.360
Yes.

00:12:57.402 --> 00:12:59.362
[WOMAN]
Huh.

00:12:59.404 --> 00:13:01.281
[DECIM] If you want, there
are more I could show you.

00:13:01.322 --> 00:13:03.825
[WOMAN]
Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm!

00:13:03.866 --> 00:13:07.161
[QUIN]
Glasses up, everyone. Cheers!

00:13:09.789 --> 00:13:11.040
Ah!

00:13:11.082 --> 00:13:12.709
[NONA]
Not doin' so well, are you?

00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:14.836
And we know whose fault that is.

00:13:14.877 --> 00:13:16.045
You mean me?

00:13:16.087 --> 00:13:17.630
You're the one who said
I was better suited

00:13:17.672 --> 00:13:20.925
to the information bureau.
It's why I let Decim take over.

00:13:20.967 --> 00:13:22.677
What you didn't
tell me was how busy

00:13:22.719 --> 00:13:24.262
things are in information.

00:13:24.304 --> 00:13:27.181
Even being an
arbiter was better.

00:13:27.223 --> 00:13:28.683
Condensing dead
peoples' memories

00:13:28.725 --> 00:13:30.476
isn't as easy as it sounds.

00:13:30.518 --> 00:13:32.228
[NONA]
Yeah. I know.

00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:34.230
[QUIN] "I know"? What do
you mean, "I know"?

00:13:34.272 --> 00:13:36.482
You've never done it before.

00:13:36.524 --> 00:13:39.152
People are dying
too fast. Way too fast.

00:13:39.193 --> 00:13:42.322
The rate is 7,000 an hour
now, did you know that?

00:13:42.363 --> 00:13:46.159
Which works out to 116 a minute,
or roughly, two per second.

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:48.077
"Okay, you're dead."
"Okay, you're dead."

00:13:48.119 --> 00:13:49.203
That's what it's like!

00:13:49.245 --> 00:13:52.665
At that pace, it's impossible
to do our best work.

00:13:54.667 --> 00:13:55.752
Yeah, I know.

00:13:55.793 --> 00:13:57.337
Saying "I know"
over and over again

00:13:57.378 --> 00:14:03.259
isn't very helpful. So, what's
the situation over there?

00:14:03.301 --> 00:14:05.928
Not too great
right now, honestly.

00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:07.930
[QUIN]
He is still new at it.

00:14:07.972 --> 00:14:12.769
He doesn't even have any doubts
about judging yet, does he?

00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:16.439
I can see it on your
face that I'm right.

00:14:16.481 --> 00:14:17.982
I'm sure if
everything went well,

00:14:18.024 --> 00:14:20.693
he could be a fascinating
arbiter someday,

00:14:20.735 --> 00:14:23.071
but that is a lot to hope for.

00:14:23.112 --> 00:14:23.863
I mean, come on.

00:14:23.905 --> 00:14:26.407
Implanting human emotions
inside an arbiter?

00:14:26.449 --> 00:14:28.868
Kinda crazy.

00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:30.870
"Number Three:

00:14:30.912 --> 00:14:34.290
Arbiters can't feel emotions,
for it's not in their natures.

00:14:34.332 --> 00:14:36.959
A dummy can't have
feelings, after all."

00:14:37.001 --> 00:14:39.879
Make sure old flower-head
doesn't find out.

00:14:39.921 --> 00:14:42.590
[NONA]
Don't worry. It'll be all right.

00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:45.551
[DECIM]
We're fairly busy.

00:14:45.593 --> 00:14:47.428
Every day, many guests
come to receive

00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:48.846
our judgments, correct?

00:14:48.888 --> 00:14:49.931
[WOMAN]
Yeah.

00:14:49.972 --> 00:14:52.350
And with each guest
comes a slew of memories.

00:14:52.392 --> 00:14:55.269
Eventually, arbiters'
minds fill with them.

00:14:55.311 --> 00:14:58.189
As you can imagine, that
poses an obstacle for us.

00:14:58.231 --> 00:15:00.608
So, to address the issue,
arbiters are set up

00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:05.613
to periodically forget the
accumulated guest memories.

00:15:05.655 --> 00:15:07.657
After judgment,
guests no longer need

00:15:07.698 --> 00:15:11.202
corporeal form, and their bodies
return to being dummies.

00:15:11.244 --> 00:15:13.788
Normally, those dummies
are disposed of,

00:15:13.830 --> 00:15:16.541
but I claim some
of them instead.

00:15:16.582 --> 00:15:18.000
[WOMAN]
Why do that?

00:15:18.042 --> 00:15:20.670
[DECIM] We're talking about
people who lived a full life.

00:15:20.711 --> 00:15:23.256
I don't like that they end up
as if they never were.

00:15:23.297 --> 00:15:25.508
It seems wrong to me somehow.

00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:28.845
[gasps] Then all
those dummies--?

00:15:28.886 --> 00:15:32.140
[DECIM] Yes. That's right.
They were all my guests.

00:15:32.181 --> 00:15:34.600
All have visited Quindecim.

00:15:34.642 --> 00:15:38.563
I chose to make dummies of them
so they would not be forgotten.

00:15:38.604 --> 00:15:40.481
[gasps]

00:15:45.445 --> 00:15:48.239
A pretty revolting
hobby, isn't it?

00:15:49.574 --> 00:15:52.910
[WOMAN]
No, it turns out it's not.

00:15:52.952 --> 00:15:54.787
[WOMAN]
Hey.

00:15:54.829 --> 00:15:57.248
Why don't you let me
make it this time?

00:15:58.458 --> 00:15:59.667
I don't know.

00:15:59.709 --> 00:16:02.795
It'll be okay. Go on,
I've got this covered.

00:16:14.056 --> 00:16:15.600
[DECIM sighs]

00:16:15.641 --> 00:16:17.602
[GINTI]
I've had enough of this!

00:16:17.643 --> 00:16:19.270
I'm sick of having
you here interfering

00:16:19.312 --> 00:16:20.688
with my judgments!

00:16:20.730 --> 00:16:22.607
Interfering? I'm not
doing anything.

00:16:22.648 --> 00:16:24.442
'Cause of you,
everything around here's

00:16:24.484 --> 00:16:26.027
turned upside down.

00:16:26.068 --> 00:16:28.696
What do mean? How else
is it supposed to be?

00:16:28.738 --> 00:16:30.072
[GINTI]
Not like this.

00:16:30.114 --> 00:16:32.408
[MAYU] Force people to risk
their lives on stupid games

00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:34.202
and things are gonna get crazy.

00:16:34.243 --> 00:16:36.579
'Cause all humans are
complete idiots, right?

00:16:36.621 --> 00:16:38.998
[MAYU sighs]
No, it's not that.

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:40.833
People generally look
out for number one,

00:16:40.875 --> 00:16:42.335
that's just how it is.

00:16:44.962 --> 00:16:47.173
If that's true,
then what's your story?

00:16:47.215 --> 00:16:48.758
Say what now?

00:16:48.799 --> 00:16:51.427
I don't really know what
you're getting at, sorry.

00:16:51.469 --> 00:16:53.387
Why are none of you
people ever capable

00:16:53.429 --> 00:16:55.598
of understanding your
own motivations?

00:16:56.849 --> 00:16:58.935
[GINTI] I should just
drop you into the void.

00:16:58.976 --> 00:17:01.729
Yeah? And what
was a void, again?

00:17:01.771 --> 00:17:02.480
[GINTI grunts]

00:17:02.522 --> 00:17:04.273
[MEMINE purrs]

00:17:04.315 --> 00:17:08.861
[GINTI] Cozying up to her?
Traitorous feline!

00:17:08.903 --> 00:17:11.656
[GINTI] Just being around
you gives me a headache.

00:17:13.824 --> 00:17:16.285
[MAYU] Ah! Watch where you
put those hands, Mister!

00:17:16.327 --> 00:17:18.246
[screams]

00:17:20.039 --> 00:17:23.000
[MAYU] Jeez! That hurt!
What was that for, anyway?

00:17:23.042 --> 00:17:27.380
[GINTI] She needs to get
out of here. Quickly.

00:17:27.421 --> 00:17:32.093
[QUIN groans] There really is
something special about alcohol

00:17:32.134 --> 00:17:34.428
from the living world,
isn't there?

00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:38.015
So, why do you spend so mucha
your time and attention

00:17:38.057 --> 00:17:40.851
on Decim, anyway?

00:17:40.893 --> 00:17:42.520
A fair question.

00:17:42.562 --> 00:17:45.606
The thing is, I think it's good
for there to be more than one

00:17:45.648 --> 00:17:50.361
method of judging people,
but so many people die each day.

00:17:50.403 --> 00:17:54.156
And we have to find a way
to judge them all somehow.

00:17:54.198 --> 00:17:57.535
This is it. We work on
auto pilot. Mechanically,

00:17:57.577 --> 00:18:00.079
no questions asked.

00:18:00.121 --> 00:18:02.123
Then afterwards, what happens?

00:18:02.164 --> 00:18:04.750
We forget everything about
the people we judged.

00:18:04.792 --> 00:18:07.253
Because if we didn't,
we couldn't continue on

00:18:07.295 --> 00:18:09.463
being arbiters.

00:18:09.505 --> 00:18:15.970
We're not human. We are dummies.
We never live and we never die.

00:18:16.012 --> 00:18:20.891
And yet we're built to look
exactly like those we judge.

00:18:20.933 --> 00:18:23.311
Doesn't it seem strange
and kind of unfair?

00:18:23.352 --> 00:18:25.980
We don't even know the first
thing about death or dying.

00:18:26.022 --> 00:18:28.899
Yet we're the ones
who judge the dead.

00:18:28.941 --> 00:18:32.236
Besides all that, I'm curious.

00:18:32.278 --> 00:18:35.489
I'd like to see an arbiter
who has human emotions,

00:18:35.531 --> 00:18:38.034
who can make human judgments.

00:18:39.869 --> 00:18:41.078
[WOMAN]
Well, eat up.

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:42.622
[DECIM]
Thank you for cooking.

00:18:48.127 --> 00:18:52.381
So, tell me some stories
about guests you've seen.

00:18:52.423 --> 00:18:54.258
What were they like,
these people?

00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:56.344
Let's say, the woman
playing the piano.

00:18:56.385 --> 00:18:59.263
You remember her, right?

00:18:59.305 --> 00:19:00.556
[DECIM]
No.

00:19:00.598 --> 00:19:01.891
What?

00:19:01.932 --> 00:19:04.727
What has been forgotten
stays forgotten.

00:19:05.728 --> 00:19:07.855
It is just a hobby, then.

00:19:14.278 --> 00:19:18.282
Aren't you even going to say
"it's good" or something?

00:19:18.324 --> 00:19:21.494
I am terribly sorry.
The food is good.

00:19:21.535 --> 00:19:22.745
How convincing.

00:19:22.787 --> 00:19:25.289
Can't you muster
some enthusiasm?

00:19:25.331 --> 00:19:29.418
[DECIM] Once again, I beg your
pardon. It is very delicious.

00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:30.920
[WOMAN]
Uh...

00:19:35.549 --> 00:19:37.968
[sighs]

00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:41.389
Ah-ha, finally awake,
are we? Good morning.

00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:42.473
[yells]

00:19:42.515 --> 00:19:45.518
You know, you're adorable
even while you're sleeping.

00:19:45.559 --> 00:19:50.022
I'm afraid poor Quin over there
can't say the same thing.

00:19:50.064 --> 00:19:52.566
I've told you not to come
in here without asking!

00:19:52.608 --> 00:19:55.027
Plus, watching me
sleep is creepy!

00:19:55.069 --> 00:19:56.821
I had no choice but
to seek you out.

00:19:56.862 --> 00:19:59.323
You haven't been spending
any time with me lately.

00:19:59.365 --> 00:20:01.701
Wounds me to my core!

00:20:01.742 --> 00:20:04.745
Go bother somebody else.
I told you, I'm busy.

00:20:04.787 --> 00:20:06.288
[OCULUS]
You stickin' to that story?

00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:10.543
'Cause you certainly don't
look busy to me. Unless...

00:20:10.584 --> 00:20:13.754
...there's something you're
hiding from me, Nona?

00:20:13.796 --> 00:20:15.881
Go away. Stupid geezer.

00:20:15.923 --> 00:20:18.050
Aw, you're so mean!

00:20:20.428 --> 00:20:21.929
Hello.

00:20:23.264 --> 00:20:27.226
[OCULUS] And what do we
have here? "Chavvot," huh?

00:20:27.268 --> 00:20:29.311
[NONA]
Oh, that?

00:20:30.479 --> 00:20:33.274
Looks like a picture book
from the living world.

00:20:33.315 --> 00:20:35.818
[NONA] I liked it, so I
sent for it, that's all.

00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:37.445
[OCULUS]
Hmm?

00:20:40.072 --> 00:20:43.242
[OCULUS] Come by every once
in a while, I'm beggin' ya.

00:20:43.284 --> 00:20:46.662
It's not fair of you
to deny me a rematch.

00:20:46.704 --> 00:20:48.748
Okay, fine. I will.

00:20:53.335 --> 00:20:55.796
[NONA]
Maybe I botched this.

00:22:19.004 --> 00:22:20.965
[NONA]
I'm sorry for asking so much.

00:22:21.006 --> 00:22:22.842
Eh, It's okay. I like you.

00:22:22.883 --> 00:22:25.010
You're always
bringing me goodies.

00:22:25.052 --> 00:22:27.304
There, that one will do.

00:22:27.346 --> 00:22:28.889
[CASTRA]
No. Do you see that?

00:22:28.931 --> 00:22:32.184
They're both marked, actually.
Gimme a sec. I'll retag them.

00:22:32.226 --> 00:22:35.229
[NONA]
I said that they'll do.

00:22:35.271 --> 00:22:37.439
[CASTRA] You want them
to go to your boy, right?

00:22:37.481 --> 00:22:40.734
Sorry, I can't. They have to
be sent to a special arbiter.

00:22:40.776 --> 00:22:42.528
I'll bring you even
better goodies next time,

00:22:42.570 --> 00:22:44.113
I promise!

00:22:45.447 --> 00:22:47.283
All right. You better.

00:22:50.244 --> 00:22:53.205
[CASTRA]
So, Nona, feeling the pressure?

00:22:54.373 --> 00:22:56.834
Well, there was never
all that much time

00:22:56.876 --> 00:22:58.335
to begin with.

00:23:15.853 --> 00:23:18.606

Episode Eight: "Death Rally."
