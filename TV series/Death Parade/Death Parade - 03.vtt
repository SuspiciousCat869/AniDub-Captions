00:00:11.303 --> 00:00:15.933
[giggles] Let's play again
sometime, all right?

00:00:15.974 --> 00:00:18.810
Yeah! Sometime soon, okay?

00:00:18.852 --> 00:00:20.562
[GIRL]
See ya later!

00:01:44.563 --> 00:01:47.107
[DECIM]
I'm sorry, sir. Excuse me.

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:49.026
[SHIGERU grunts]

00:01:55.282 --> 00:01:56.158
[SHIGERU]
What the--?

00:01:56.199 --> 00:01:58.619
[DECIM]
I hope your sleep was restful.

00:02:02.414 --> 00:02:03.582
What is this place?

00:02:03.624 --> 00:02:06.001
I will be happy to explain
that in just a moment.

00:02:06.043 --> 00:02:08.211
If you'll step this way, please.

00:02:15.427 --> 00:02:16.470
[WOMAN B]
How are you?

00:02:16.511 --> 00:02:20.140
Oh. I'm fine, th-thanks...

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.270
What is it? Is something wrong?

00:02:25.312 --> 00:02:28.815
Uh-- I'm sorry.
I'm kind of out of it.

00:02:28.857 --> 00:02:29.608
[DECIM]
All right.

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.195
We shall begin now.
Allow us to welcome you.

00:02:33.236 --> 00:02:35.656
It's a pleasure to have you
here at the Quindecim.

00:02:35.697 --> 00:02:38.367
My name is Decim, and
I'll be your bartender.

00:02:38.408 --> 00:02:40.410
Now then. I have a question.

00:02:40.452 --> 00:02:43.163
I hope you do not find
it too impertinent.

00:02:43.205 --> 00:02:46.208
Do you remember anything just
prior to your arrival here?

00:02:46.249 --> 00:02:47.292
Well, no.

00:02:47.334 --> 00:02:50.504
I had been asleep when I
realized what was happening.

00:02:50.545 --> 00:02:52.130
The last thing I can remember...

00:02:52.172 --> 00:02:53.840
...is riding alone at
the back of the bus

00:02:53.882 --> 00:02:55.801
on the way home from college.

00:02:55.842 --> 00:02:57.511
Thank you for indulging me.

00:02:57.552 --> 00:02:59.971
How about you?

00:03:00.013 --> 00:03:03.350
No. I don't remember
anything, either.

00:03:03.392 --> 00:03:06.019
Very good, thank you. Moving on.

00:03:06.061 --> 00:03:09.106
I will now explain some details
about your current situation.

00:03:09.147 --> 00:03:12.192
This is important.
Please pay close attention.

00:03:12.234 --> 00:03:14.236
Number one!

00:03:14.277 --> 00:03:16.780
First: I cannot provide
you with any information

00:03:16.822 --> 00:03:19.032
regarding your present location.

00:03:19.074 --> 00:03:20.409
Number two!

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.787
However, now that you are here,
we shall ask you to play a game.

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:25.706
What? A-A game?

00:03:25.747 --> 00:03:27.541
[WOMAN]
Number three!

00:03:27.582 --> 00:03:28.792
As to game selection--

00:03:28.834 --> 00:03:31.336
That will be decided
upon by roulette.

00:03:31.378 --> 00:03:32.963
[SHIGERU, WOMAN B gasp]

00:03:33.004 --> 00:03:33.839
Number four...

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.924
You'll find the stakes
of the game are very high.

00:03:35.966 --> 00:03:37.342
Your lives, in fact.

00:03:37.384 --> 00:03:38.343
[SHIGERU]
Whoa, hold on!

00:03:38.385 --> 00:03:39.511
And number five.

00:03:39.553 --> 00:03:41.596
Don't worry, this is
the final point.

00:03:41.638 --> 00:03:44.641
Until the game is completed,
you cannot leave.

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:50.021
[SHIGERU]
I don't think it's coming.

00:03:50.063 --> 00:03:51.398
[WOMAN B]
No, neither do I.

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.025
[SHIGERU] What's with
this game stuff, huh?

00:03:54.067 --> 00:03:56.069
Doesn't make a lot
of sense to me.

00:03:56.111 --> 00:03:57.362
Huh?

00:03:58.697 --> 00:04:00.031
Yeah.

00:04:00.073 --> 00:04:01.616
Hey, is something the matter?

00:04:01.658 --> 00:04:03.785
[WOMAN B]
Well, it's just that...

00:04:03.827 --> 00:04:05.620
I can't remember anything.

00:04:05.662 --> 00:04:08.749
Yeah, I understand.
Neither can I.

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.002
No, what I mean is, I don't
remember anything at all.

00:04:12.043 --> 00:04:14.963
Really, nothing. I don't
even know who I am.

00:04:15.005 --> 00:04:17.924
It's like I've forgotten
everything about myself,

00:04:17.966 --> 00:04:19.801
including my name.

00:04:21.386 --> 00:04:23.013
It's so weird.

00:04:23.054 --> 00:04:24.765
You remember some
things though, right?

00:04:24.806 --> 00:04:25.682
Like your name?

00:04:25.724 --> 00:04:26.850
A few things, yeah.

00:04:26.892 --> 00:04:28.852
I know my name is Shigeru Miura.

00:04:28.894 --> 00:04:31.563
[WOMAN B]
Oh, okay.

00:04:31.605 --> 00:04:35.066
I'm scared. I don't
know what to do.

00:04:35.108 --> 00:04:36.234
If it helps at all,

00:04:36.276 --> 00:04:39.863
I believe you will recall
your name following the game.

00:04:39.905 --> 00:04:40.906
Who are you, anyway?

00:04:40.947 --> 00:04:42.908
How can you just promise
something like that?

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:46.578
Sorry. I'm afraid I cannot
answer that question.

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.372
[WOMAN B] I have to say,
having no idea who I am

00:04:49.414 --> 00:04:51.458
is really pretty terrifying.

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.084
If it actually will
help me remember,

00:04:53.126 --> 00:04:55.378
then I'd like to play the game.

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:59.424
Except that... I'm guessing
I can't play it alone.

00:05:02.761 --> 00:05:05.889
All right, I'll do it.
I'll play your game.

00:05:06.681 --> 00:05:08.141
Great! Thank you so much!

00:05:08.183 --> 00:05:09.518
Now, if I could just have you

00:05:09.559 --> 00:05:13.230
press this button, please.
The roulette will begin.

00:05:24.491 --> 00:05:26.451
[game music plays]

00:05:28.245 --> 00:05:29.871
[BOTH grunt]

00:05:29.913 --> 00:05:31.957
[BOTH gasp]

00:05:45.053 --> 00:05:47.305
[WOMAN] The rules are the
same as for regular bowling,

00:05:47.347 --> 00:05:48.932
with some exceptions.

00:05:48.974 --> 00:05:50.934
For example, you will
only be allowed to bowl

00:05:50.976 --> 00:05:52.477
one ball per frame.

00:05:52.519 --> 00:05:55.438
You will take turns in this
manner until the game is over.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:56.982
Of course, as you might expect,

00:05:57.023 --> 00:06:00.527
whoever knocks over
the most pins will win.

00:06:00.569 --> 00:06:03.071
The balls you will use
have already been selected.

00:06:03.113 --> 00:06:04.698
You'll find them on your left.

00:06:04.739 --> 00:06:06.241
As you can see, they
have representations

00:06:06.283 --> 00:06:09.369
of each of your hearts inside.

00:06:09.411 --> 00:06:10.495
Ugh.

00:06:10.537 --> 00:06:12.163
What are you saying?

00:06:12.205 --> 00:06:15.417
[WOMAN] The pink is yours.
You're bowling with her heart.

00:06:15.458 --> 00:06:17.252
And the blue is your ball.

00:06:17.294 --> 00:06:20.589
Think of that as his
heart inside of it.

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:24.134
[DECIM] Very well.
The game will now begin.

00:06:35.353 --> 00:06:38.940
[heartbeat thumping]

[SHIGERU yelps]

00:06:40.859 --> 00:06:42.652
What is it? What's wrong?

00:06:42.694 --> 00:06:44.070
The ball just throbbed!

00:06:44.112 --> 00:06:44.905
Huh?

00:06:44.946 --> 00:06:47.198
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.242
We did forget to
mention one thing.

00:06:49.284 --> 00:06:51.703
You're linked to your
respective balls.

00:06:51.745 --> 00:06:53.413
They register your pulses.

00:06:53.455 --> 00:06:56.666
Also their temperature is the
same as that of your bodies.

00:06:56.708 --> 00:06:57.584
[gasps]

00:06:57.626 --> 00:06:58.793
[DECIM] You should know
that you will not

00:06:58.835 --> 00:07:01.630
feel any actual pain.
I hope that helps.

00:07:01.671 --> 00:07:04.925
There's no wiggle room, here?
We absolutely have to use these?

00:07:04.966 --> 00:07:06.051
[DECIM]
That is the rule, yes.

00:07:06.092 --> 00:07:07.636
[gasps]

00:07:19.773 --> 00:07:22.525
[SHIGERU]
So, this is her heartbeat, huh?

00:07:22.567 --> 00:07:24.986
I wonder if she's nervous.

00:07:25.028 --> 00:07:27.572
It feels like it's
going a little fast.

00:07:29.407 --> 00:07:32.410
[SHIGERU] And this is
the heat of her body.

00:07:32.452 --> 00:07:36.790
She feels so warm inside.

00:07:36.831 --> 00:07:37.582
[SHIGERU gasps]

00:07:37.624 --> 00:07:40.460
[SHIGERU] Stop it, you
creep! Snap out of it!

00:07:49.052 --> 00:07:50.887
Aw, damn, a split!

[yelps]

00:08:00.855 --> 00:08:02.023
A-Are you okay?

00:08:02.065 --> 00:08:04.192
Oh, sorry! I'm fine!

00:08:04.234 --> 00:08:06.611
It's just more life-like
than I expected.

00:08:06.653 --> 00:08:07.946
[gasps]

00:08:12.367 --> 00:08:14.744
[SHIGERU] She's gonna be
able to tell how you feel.

00:08:14.786 --> 00:08:21.001
Just calm down.
Calm down. Calm down.

00:08:21.042 --> 00:08:23.169
[WOMAN B]
It's beating on the fast side.

00:08:23.211 --> 00:08:26.339
I wonder if he's
a little nervous.

00:08:26.381 --> 00:08:28.591
Of course, how could he not be?

00:08:28.633 --> 00:08:31.052
Given the circumstances.

00:08:41.104 --> 00:08:42.063
I got five.

00:08:42.105 --> 00:08:43.898
Wow, you're good at this, huh?

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:46.109
Nice throw. And
your form is great.

00:08:46.151 --> 00:08:49.529
[WOMAN B] It is? Really?
That's nice of you to say.

[gasps]

00:09:03.668 --> 00:09:05.462
You're looking at
me kind of funny.

00:09:05.503 --> 00:09:07.047
Is everything okay?
It's your turn.

00:09:07.088 --> 00:09:09.299
Oh, right, sorry.

00:09:13.261 --> 00:09:14.888
[SHIGERU]
That girl I used to play with

00:09:14.929 --> 00:09:18.933
back when I was a little kid.
What was her name again?

00:09:18.975 --> 00:09:22.145
We were still pretty young
when she moved away.

00:09:22.187 --> 00:09:24.689
Nah, it couldn't be.

00:09:29.069 --> 00:09:32.989
Aw! That was a horrible throw!

00:09:33.031 --> 00:09:35.075
[giggles] You'll do
better next time.

00:09:35.116 --> 00:09:37.118
Thanks! I hope you're right.

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:39.037
A relaxed and friendly game.

00:09:39.079 --> 00:09:41.372
It's nice to have those
once in a while.

00:09:41.414 --> 00:09:42.373
[DECIM]
Hm?

00:09:42.415 --> 00:09:43.875
[WOMAN]
Hm. What is it?

00:09:43.917 --> 00:09:44.793
Oh, nothing.

00:09:44.834 --> 00:09:46.961
Just that you're getting
quite used to this.

00:09:47.003 --> 00:09:50.048
And I appreciate your help in
explaining the rules, as well.

00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:52.092
Sure thing. Don't mention it.

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:26.709
[SHIGERU] It's been awhile since
I've had such a good time.

00:10:26.751 --> 00:10:28.795
Yeah, who knew
something like bowling

00:10:28.837 --> 00:10:30.588
could be so much fun, right?

00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:33.299
Especially when you don't
remember how you got here,

00:10:33.341 --> 00:10:34.425
or who you are.

00:10:34.467 --> 00:10:36.052
Whoops! I'm a jerk. Sorry!

00:10:36.094 --> 00:10:39.430
No! I really am enjoying myself!

00:10:45.395 --> 00:10:47.730
[SHIGERU]
Um, maybe this is weird,

00:10:47.772 --> 00:10:50.608
but I'd like to make a side bet.

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:51.651
A what?

00:10:51.693 --> 00:10:55.405
[SHIGERU] You know,
a wager, just between us.

00:10:55.446 --> 00:10:57.824
If I win, you go
on a date with me.

00:10:57.866 --> 00:10:59.576
[gasps]

00:11:01.035 --> 00:11:02.620
Aw, too bad.

00:11:02.662 --> 00:11:04.497
It shouldn't interfere
with our business.

00:11:04.539 --> 00:11:06.541
No... That isn't what I mean.

00:11:06.583 --> 00:11:09.210
The whole "already dead"
thing. I feel bad for them.

00:11:09.252 --> 00:11:10.920
Oh, I see.

00:11:10.962 --> 00:11:15.091
[WOMAN B] I didn't expect that!
My heart's racing now.

00:11:15.133 --> 00:11:18.136
I'm not the only one.
Look at Shigeru's heart.

00:11:18.178 --> 00:11:21.723
It's embarrassing in
a good way, somehow.

00:11:21.764 --> 00:11:25.518
But why does all of
this feel so familiar?

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:27.770
And so good, for that matter.

00:11:32.483 --> 00:11:33.610
[WOMAN B gasps]

00:11:40.867 --> 00:11:44.704
[SHIGERU] Whoa! A strike!
Another great throw.

00:11:44.746 --> 00:11:46.831
You must have some
bowling experience.

00:11:46.873 --> 00:11:50.084
Still, I'm determined
to beat you!

00:11:50.126 --> 00:11:51.461
Hey, everything okay?

00:11:51.502 --> 00:11:55.590
[gasps] Oh, I'm fine. Sorry.
I guess I got distracted.

00:11:57.300 --> 00:12:00.053
[WOMAN B] I think that was
a fraction of a memory.

00:12:00.094 --> 00:12:04.182
If so, then I've met
Shigeru somewhere before.

00:12:08.311 --> 00:12:11.731
[WOMAN B]
It's no use. I can't remember.

[giggles] Bye, Shigeru!

00:12:23.826 --> 00:12:26.120
Let's play again
sometime, all right?

00:12:26.162 --> 00:12:28.289
Yeah! Sometime soon, okay?

00:12:28.331 --> 00:12:30.166
Bye, Chisato!

Hey, Shigeru.

00:12:38.716 --> 00:12:40.551
Huh?

I remember my name.

00:12:42.637 --> 00:12:46.140
I'm Chisato! That's it!
Chisato Miyazaki!

00:12:46.182 --> 00:12:48.935
Remember? We used to play
together at the park!

00:12:48.977 --> 00:12:50.687
It was you, me, and Mai!

00:12:50.728 --> 00:12:53.731
[gasps] I knew it!

00:12:54.899 --> 00:12:57.694
You're Chisato. You're the

I can't believe it!

00:12:58.611 --> 00:12:59.737
Long time no see!

00:12:59.779 --> 00:13:01.739
Ah, the beginning of the end.

00:13:01.781 --> 00:13:03.866
How very cryptic.
Would you care to explain?

00:13:03.908 --> 00:13:05.743
No.

Sorry. I don't accept that.
Tell me what you meant!

00:13:09.372 --> 00:13:10.748
All right. I will.

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:12.834
What? You mean that
actually worked?

00:13:12.875 --> 00:13:15.712
But, you must promise
not to raise your voice.

Yes.

00:13:25.346 --> 00:13:28.433
Given that, those two may not
have the fairytale ending

00:13:28.474 --> 00:13:29.642
you're hoping for.

00:13:29.684 --> 00:13:30.768
[WOMAN muffled grunting]

00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:32.020
But keep in mind,

00:13:32.061 --> 00:13:34.063
regardless of what
the outcome is,

00:13:34.105 --> 00:13:36.482
we must be prepared
to accept it.

00:13:48.119 --> 00:13:50.663
[CHISATO]
So, here's the plan. Next,

00:13:50.705 --> 00:13:53.583
I predict I'm going to
throw a gutter ball.

00:13:53.624 --> 00:13:54.876
[SHIGERU]
If she throws her turn,

00:13:54.917 --> 00:13:58.046
that will basically
ensure our date together.

00:13:58.087 --> 00:14:01.758
but I still wanna get
the highest score I can.

00:14:01.799 --> 00:14:04.052
Come on! Strike!

Just trust me, okay?

00:14:12.185 --> 00:14:14.729
One of the girls who
works here is totally hot.

Yeah.

Hey, isn't she the girl who--?

Yeah, I think she is.

Oh, right, you went to

wrong? Did you hurt your back?

Okay, this is the last frame.

00:15:28.010 --> 00:15:30.263
One gutter ball coming right up.

It was you, me, and Mai!

that Chisato had to move.

Yeah. Sure does.

00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:08.342

Yes.

I'm afraid you have both
left the land of the living.

Following their deaths,
people are judged

00:16:43.169 --> 00:16:45.546
and sent to either
Heaven or to Hell.

00:16:45.588 --> 00:16:47.048
For the purpose of that ruling--

00:16:47.089 --> 00:16:48.674
You can stop there.

of the explanation.

It's hard to believe
that we're really dead,

but at least now we have
the chance to talk.

00:17:24.377 --> 00:17:27.129
Since our conversation
got cut short earlier.

Yeah, I guess you're right.

Dead or not, we can still
spend time together.

So. Like I said.

a date to claim.

together that we can.

Can we have some
time for a date?

Very well. That can be done.

will be long enough?

not long enough!

00:22:36.730 --> 00:22:39.900
Yet they become intertwined
somehow, tangled up,

00:22:39.942 --> 00:22:42.820
and nobody knows how
they are going to end.

00:22:42.862 --> 00:22:45.781
True enough, You never
know until you die,

00:22:45.823 --> 00:22:49.618
and for that matter, you may not
even know after you die.

00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:51.287
But, then again,

00:22:51.328 --> 00:22:53.581
that's what makes
it interesting, right?

00:22:58.252 --> 00:23:00.921
That was very impressive.

00:23:00.963 --> 00:23:02.673
