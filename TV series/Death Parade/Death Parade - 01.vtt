[gasps]

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:25.108
Machiko!

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.611
Baby! Thank god!
What is this weird place?

00:00:27.653 --> 00:00:30.280
I don't know. My memory
is a complete blank.

00:00:30.322 --> 00:00:32.115
Strange. So is mine!

00:00:32.157 --> 00:00:34.159
This doesn't make any sense.

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:57.057
[MACHIKO gasps]

00:00:59.768 --> 00:01:02.437
Right this way, please.

00:01:02.521 --> 00:01:05.816
Welcome to Quindecim.
Please have a seat.

00:02:28.607 --> 00:02:29.775
A pleasure to meet you.

00:02:29.816 --> 00:02:32.569
My name is Decim and I
will be your bartender.

00:02:32.611 --> 00:02:33.945
Yeah, okay.

00:02:33.987 --> 00:02:36.365
You will most likely find
this a strange question,

00:02:36.406 --> 00:02:39.368
but I'm afraid I
do have to ask it.

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:43.413
Do you remember anything
prior to your arrival here?

00:02:43.455 --> 00:02:47.918
Nothing. Neither of us
seems to, although...

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:49.503
Thinking about it,
I'm pretty sure

00:02:49.544 --> 00:02:51.380
we were on our honeymoon.

00:02:51.421 --> 00:02:52.339
Yeah, you're right.

00:02:52.381 --> 00:02:54.841
I can actually remember
that much, too.

00:02:54.883 --> 00:02:57.969
Yes, very good. Thank you
for indulging me.

00:02:58.011 --> 00:03:00.847
Anyway, forget that.
Tell us about this place.

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:01.973
One moment.

00:03:02.015 --> 00:03:04.768
I will now explain some
things about your situation.

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.980
This is important.
Please pay close attention.

00:03:09.022 --> 00:03:11.400
Number one: I'm afraid
I cannot provide you

00:03:11.441 --> 00:03:14.778
with any information regarding
your current location.

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.239
Number two: Now that
you are here,

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.408
we shall have you play a game.

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:21.827
I'm sorry, "play a game"?

00:03:21.868 --> 00:03:24.538
[DECIM] Number three:
as to game selection--

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:27.124
That will be decided
upon by roulette.

00:03:27.165 --> 00:03:28.333
[TAKASHI, MACHIKO gasp]

00:03:28.375 --> 00:03:31.545
Number four: The stakes
of the game are very high.

00:03:31.586 --> 00:03:33.088
Your lives, in fact.

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:34.673
[TAKASHI] What the hell
are you talking about?

00:03:34.715 --> 00:03:37.509
And number five: Don't worry,
this is the final point.

00:03:37.551 --> 00:03:39.928
Until the game is completed,
you cannot leave.

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:43.890
Huh? I think we've
heard enough, thanks.

00:03:43.932 --> 00:03:44.850
Let's go.

00:03:44.891 --> 00:03:46.226
[MACHIKO]
Uh, yeah.

00:03:46.268 --> 00:03:48.895
[TAKASHI]
Poor guy. He's obviously nuts.

00:03:51.648 --> 00:03:53.608
--[TAKASHI] Hm?
--That's strange.

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:56.570
Nope. This is the bathroom.

00:03:56.611 --> 00:03:58.196
Ah, damn it!

00:04:01.408 --> 00:04:02.951
[growls]

00:04:05.162 --> 00:04:06.747
All right. Where's the exit?

00:04:06.788 --> 00:04:08.915
[DECIM] As I have explained,
you cannot leave the bar

00:04:08.957 --> 00:04:10.625
until the game is finished.

00:04:10.667 --> 00:04:14.004
And if I say we're not
playing your damn game?

00:04:14.045 --> 00:04:17.132
[DECIM] I would sincerely
recommend against it.

00:04:17.174 --> 00:04:18.383
[MACHIKO, TAKASHI gasp]

00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:21.803
[TAKASHI]
What...?

00:04:23.722 --> 00:04:25.056
[BOTH gasp]

00:04:27.642 --> 00:04:30.312
Those look like-- Are they--?

00:04:30.353 --> 00:04:33.899
[TAKASHI] What is this place?
Why are there bodies?

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.984
As I outlined in both
points two and four,

00:04:36.026 --> 00:04:37.527
we would like you to
play a game in which

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:38.820
the stakes are your lives.

00:04:38.862 --> 00:04:41.490
I'm afraid I cannot
say more than that.

00:04:41.531 --> 00:04:45.035
[TAKASHI] He's some
kind of psycho. Must be.

00:04:45.076 --> 00:04:47.370
If I could have you
press this button, please.

00:04:47.412 --> 00:04:51.416
The roulette will begin,
and the game will be decided.

00:04:51.458 --> 00:04:52.834
[MACHIKO]
What do you think?

00:04:52.876 --> 00:04:55.378
[TAKASHI] Let's just do
what he says for now.

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:56.880
Who knows what'll
happen if we don't?

00:04:56.922 --> 00:04:59.257
The guy's clearly unbalanced.

00:04:59.299 --> 00:05:00.675
Yeah, you're right.

00:05:08.433 --> 00:05:10.268
[game music plays]

00:05:14.064 --> 00:05:15.607
[TAKASHI, MACHIKO gasp]

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.284
[BOTH gasp]

00:05:29.955 --> 00:05:31.706
[DECIM] The rules of
the game are simple.

00:05:31.748 --> 00:05:34.209
You will take turns throwing
the darts in front of you,

00:05:34.251 --> 00:05:36.670
until someone
reaches zero points.

00:05:36.711 --> 00:05:38.630
Alternatively, if you
should run out of darts

00:05:38.672 --> 00:05:41.550
before that happens,
whoever's score is lower

00:05:41.591 --> 00:05:43.343
will be named the winner.

00:05:43.385 --> 00:05:45.136
You've each been
given seven darts.

00:05:45.178 --> 00:05:48.014
Please throw them from
behind the line indicated.

00:05:49.975 --> 00:05:53.395
[DECIM] The outer ring is worth
double, and the inner, triple.

00:05:53.436 --> 00:05:55.689
A single bull is
worth 25 points,

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:58.024
while a double is worth 50.

00:06:01.736 --> 00:06:04.739
[DECIM] You'll notice various
regions of the body depicted.

00:06:04.781 --> 00:06:07.534
Those are linked to your
respective nervous systems.

00:06:09.035 --> 00:06:12.747
Wait, what did you say?
We're linked to the boards?

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:13.540
Yes.

00:06:13.582 --> 00:06:16.334
Where the darts hit, you will
feel a corresponding pain.

00:06:16.376 --> 00:06:17.460
Impossible.

00:06:17.502 --> 00:06:19.421
[DECIM] And, naturally,
the higher the score is,

00:06:19.462 --> 00:06:21.840
the greater your pain will be.

00:06:21.882 --> 00:06:24.634
No. There's no way.
You're lying.

00:06:24.676 --> 00:06:25.844
Calm down, honey.

00:06:25.886 --> 00:06:27.721
Obviously, this guy
is full of it.

00:06:27.762 --> 00:06:30.974
Let's just pretend to go
along with it for now, okay?

00:06:31.016 --> 00:06:31.850
You sure?

00:06:31.892 --> 00:06:35.896
If things do get ugly,
I'll figure something out.

00:06:35.937 --> 00:06:38.273
[MACHIKO]
I trust you.

00:06:38.315 --> 00:06:41.776
[DECIM] Very well.
The game will now begin.

00:06:56.291 --> 00:06:58.001
[TAKASHI]
Linked to the boards, huh?

00:06:58.043 --> 00:07:00.420
There's just no way
they could do that.

00:07:04.799 --> 00:07:07.177
[yelps]

00:07:07.218 --> 00:07:09.888
Machiko! No, it's impossible!

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:11.806
Maybe it's just in my head.

00:07:11.848 --> 00:07:14.059
All I felt was a
little twinge of pain.

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:16.186
It doesn't even hurt anymore.

00:07:16.227 --> 00:07:19.564
Don't worry, I really
think I'm okay.

00:07:19.606 --> 00:07:20.273
[TAKASHI]
I don't know--

00:07:20.315 --> 00:07:23.109
[MACHIKO]
It's all right. Just calm down.

00:07:23.151 --> 00:07:25.820
Here. Why don't I
give it a try now?

00:07:36.122 --> 00:07:37.374
[groans]

00:07:37.415 --> 00:07:39.793
[MACHIKO]
Baby! Does it really hurt?

00:07:39.834 --> 00:07:42.128
[TAKASHI]
It's true. There is a link!

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:44.464
How can they be doing this?

00:07:44.506 --> 00:07:47.008
--[gasping]
--[TAKASHI groaning]

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:49.302
[TAKASHI]
Did something stick me?

00:07:51.346 --> 00:07:53.682
[TAKASHI]
No, there's nothing.

00:07:54.724 --> 00:07:55.266
Takashi!

00:07:55.308 --> 00:07:57.060
Just wait over there.

00:07:57.102 --> 00:07:58.937
Don't think you can
fool me, you psycho.

00:07:58.979 --> 00:08:02.190
I'm a doctor! There's no
sign of any surgery.

00:08:02.232 --> 00:08:04.109
What have you done to us?!

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:06.027
Nothing in particular.

00:08:06.069 --> 00:08:08.238
[TAKASHI] Then how are you
making us feel pain?

00:08:08.279 --> 00:08:09.072
You can stop it.

00:08:09.114 --> 00:08:10.198
[gasps]

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:12.367
As I told you before,
in this game,

00:08:12.409 --> 00:08:14.494
your lives are at stake.

00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:20.959
[DECIM] If you want to
avoid inflicting pain,

00:08:20.959 --> 00:08:23.712
then all you have to do
is miss the targets.

00:08:23.753 --> 00:08:24.713
Seriously?

00:08:24.754 --> 00:08:26.631
You can miss with all
six remaining darts.

00:08:26.673 --> 00:08:29.968
That will bring the game
to a swift conclusion.

00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:32.512
Oh, yeah. I didn't
think about that.

00:08:32.554 --> 00:08:33.847
Except, of course,

00:08:33.888 --> 00:08:37.058
that will ensure that
Machiko will be the victor.

00:08:42.147 --> 00:08:44.399
[TAKASHI]
I would lose?

00:08:44.441 --> 00:08:49.237
What is it? What did
he say? Can you hear me?

00:08:49.279 --> 00:08:50.530
Oh, yeah.

00:08:50.572 --> 00:08:52.991
Apparently, we have to
keep playing the game.

00:08:53.033 --> 00:08:55.452
He did give me a
really good tip, though.

00:08:55.493 --> 00:08:57.328
We can just keep
throwing and missing.

00:08:57.370 --> 00:08:59.831
It'll end quickly that way.

00:08:59.873 --> 00:09:01.291
We can do that? Really?

00:09:01.332 --> 00:09:03.293
[TAKASHI]
Yeah.

00:09:03.334 --> 00:09:04.627
Except, if we do...

00:09:04.669 --> 00:09:07.005
Well, look at the score.
You would lose.

00:09:07.047 --> 00:09:09.549
Let's not worry
about that for now.

00:09:12.802 --> 00:09:16.639
[TAKASHI] That's right.
It doesn't matter if I lose.

00:09:18.349 --> 00:09:20.560
[TAKASHI]
As long as I still have Machiko.

00:09:20.602 --> 00:09:22.103
[sighs]

00:09:25.982 --> 00:09:27.650
[TAKASHI gasps]

00:09:27.692 --> 00:09:30.737
Is something wrong?
It's your turn to throw.

00:09:30.779 --> 00:09:33.073
I spaced out. Sorry.

Oh, no! I'm so sorry!

Are you okay?

00:10:27.085 --> 00:10:28.711
[TAKASHI]
You had to hit the double ring!

00:10:28.753 --> 00:10:31.923
I didn't do it on purpose!
You know that, right?

00:10:34.801 --> 00:10:38.847
[MACHIKO] I'm so sorry!
Baby, I'm so sorry!

00:10:42.308 --> 00:10:44.853
[MACHIKO]
I swear, I didn't mean to!

00:10:44.894 --> 00:10:46.938
Please, baby, don't!

00:10:47.564 --> 00:10:50.024

Or, if you have to...

00:10:50.066 --> 00:10:52.944
At least try not
to hit my belly.

00:10:52.986 --> 00:10:54.529

00:11:00.034 --> 00:11:01.536
[MACHIKO]
Yes.

00:11:07.041 --> 00:11:08.877
[TAKASHI]
That explains it.

00:11:08.918 --> 00:11:10.795
You haven't been
acting like yourself.

00:11:10.837 --> 00:11:11.754
[MACHIKO]
Yes.

00:11:11.796 --> 00:11:13.548
How many weeks are you?

00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:14.883
[MACHIKO]
About ten now.

00:11:14.924 --> 00:11:16.634
Why didn't you say something?

00:11:16.676 --> 00:11:18.136
[MACHIKO]
I was going to.

00:11:18.178 --> 00:11:20.763
I wanted to surprise
you during our trip.

00:11:20.805 --> 00:11:23.183
I haven't told anybody yet.

00:11:23.224 --> 00:11:26.019
I wanted you to be
the first one to know.

00:11:28.021 --> 00:11:30.565
I'm glad I was.

00:11:30.607 --> 00:11:32.483
I'm so happy, honey.

00:11:32.525 --> 00:11:34.485
Try to take it easy now, okay?

00:11:34.527 --> 00:11:37.655
Right. I'll do my best.

00:11:40.074 --> 00:11:43.578
[TAKASHI] I can't believe I'm
finally going to be a father!

00:11:46.831 --> 00:11:48.124
[gasps]

00:11:52.462 --> 00:11:55.048
[groans]

00:11:55.089 --> 00:12:02.847
[panting]

00:12:13.399 --> 00:12:14.609
How could you?

00:12:14.651 --> 00:12:16.069
[TAKASHI]
It wasn't on purpose.

00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:17.111
[MACHIKO]
Yeah, right!

00:12:17.153 --> 00:12:19.280
What if something
happens to the baby?

00:12:19.322 --> 00:12:20.240
Hmph!

00:12:20.281 --> 00:12:21.866
[MACHIKO]
What? What is it?

00:12:21.908 --> 00:12:23.034
[TAKASHI]
I can't even look at you.

00:12:23.076 --> 00:12:26.663
How could I have forgotten
that of all things?

00:12:26.704 --> 00:12:29.040
What are you talking about?

00:12:29.082 --> 00:12:31.876
Think, Machiko. Think real hard.

00:12:31.918 --> 00:12:33.336
[WOMAN 1A]
That was a nice ceremony, huh?

00:12:33.378 --> 00:12:35.463
[WOMAN 1B]
Yeah. You have to admit, though.

00:12:35.505 --> 00:12:37.632
Matchy really does play to win.

00:12:37.674 --> 00:12:39.509
Oh, yeah, she does.

00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:40.635
"Matchy"?

00:12:40.677 --> 00:12:41.594
--Do they mean Machiko?
--[WOMAN 1A] She's always been

00:12:41.636 --> 00:12:42.428
--Do they mean Machiko?
--that way.

00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:45.265
Matchy sees something she
wants and goes after it.

00:12:45.306 --> 00:12:46.224
You're not kidding!

00:12:46.266 --> 00:12:47.850
I hear her husband's a doctor.

00:12:47.892 --> 00:12:48.935
[gasps]

00:12:48.977 --> 00:12:50.061
[WOMAN 1A]
I'm so jealous!

00:12:50.103 --> 00:12:52.480
A successful husband
and a hot boyfriend.

00:12:52.522 --> 00:12:56.651
[WOMEN giggle]

00:12:58.361 --> 00:12:59.612
Your friends should
be more careful

00:12:59.654 --> 00:13:00.655
with what they say.

00:13:00.697 --> 00:13:03.491
I heard every word of
their little conversation.

00:13:03.533 --> 00:13:05.618
About what? Me?

00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:07.036
[TAKASHI]
It's almost funny.

00:13:07.078 --> 00:13:08.579
Finding out that you're
having an affair

00:13:08.621 --> 00:13:10.581
on the same day as our wedding.

00:13:10.623 --> 00:13:12.959
What are you saying?
What affair?

00:13:12.959 --> 00:13:15.086
[TAKASHI] And I still
went through with it.

00:13:15.128 --> 00:13:17.130
I couldn't bring myself
to call it off.

00:13:17.171 --> 00:13:20.508
I just kept trying to pretend
I hadn't heard them.

00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:22.885
No, you're wrong!
I've been faithful!

00:13:22.927 --> 00:13:23.886
I loved you so much!

00:13:23.928 --> 00:13:25.388
I would have done
anything for you!

00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:26.347
I love you, too!

00:13:26.389 --> 00:13:27.557
Whatever you've
heard, it's wrong!

00:13:27.598 --> 00:13:29.684
Don't you lie to me!

00:13:29.726 --> 00:13:32.520
I'm not lying! It's the truth!

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:36.482
Oh, well. It's all over now.

00:13:36.524 --> 00:13:38.860
[gasps]

00:13:38.901 --> 00:13:40.486
Tell me, bartender.

00:13:40.528 --> 00:13:41.904
What would you like to know?

00:13:41.946 --> 00:13:43.072
Those rules of yours.

00:13:43.114 --> 00:13:45.074
There's one you haven't
told us, right?

00:13:45.116 --> 00:13:47.327
What are you doing?
That one isn't yours.

00:13:47.368 --> 00:13:48.661
So what if it isn't.

00:13:48.703 --> 00:13:49.996
You see, when he
explained the rules,

00:13:50.038 --> 00:13:53.583
he never actually specified
the targets. Isn't that right?

00:13:53.624 --> 00:13:54.959
Your assumption is correct.

00:13:55.001 --> 00:13:59.047
As long as the dart hits a
target, points will be scored.

00:13:59.088 --> 00:14:00.340
The game's predicated on us

00:14:00.381 --> 00:14:02.508
taking from each other
from the beginning.

00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:04.802
Seven darts were never
going to be enough.

00:14:04.844 --> 00:14:06.846
The dart in your hand
is the last to be thrown,

00:14:06.888 --> 00:14:09.932
meaning, whosever target it hits
will be the winner of the game.

00:14:09.974 --> 00:14:12.560
You still haven't told us
what happens to the loser.

00:14:12.602 --> 00:14:16.606
Nor can I tell you at this time.
Please accept my apology.

00:14:16.647 --> 00:14:18.483
Rules are rules, eh?

00:14:18.524 --> 00:14:18.900
Ah, well.

00:14:18.941 --> 00:14:20.568
Why don't we give old
"Play-to-win" Matchy

00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:24.113
a taste of defeat and
see how she likes it?

00:14:24.155 --> 00:14:26.699
You're not used to
losing, are you?

00:14:26.741 --> 00:14:28.159
Who's Matchy?

00:14:28.201 --> 00:14:30.119
[TAKASHI]
That's your nickname, isn't it?

00:14:32.914 --> 00:14:35.333
Hold on. Just think
back for a second.

00:14:35.375 --> 00:14:37.001
Remember me telling
you there was a friend

00:14:37.043 --> 00:14:39.295
coming to our wedding
I hadn't seen in years?

00:14:39.337 --> 00:14:40.004
[TAKASHI]
I...

00:14:40.046 --> 00:14:42.799
Yeah, Machida Yuki.
A friend from school.

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:45.593
She really hated her name
when we were younger.

00:14:45.635 --> 00:14:48.763
She said it was too
masculine for her.

00:14:48.805 --> 00:14:51.224
Wait a sec, are you saying...?

00:14:51.265 --> 00:14:54.560
That's the reason we gave
her the nickname "Matchy."

00:14:54.602 --> 00:14:56.354
She's Matchy?

00:14:56.396 --> 00:14:57.814
[MACHIKO] I remember
hearing she got married

00:14:57.855 --> 00:15:00.691
several years ago to a doctor.

00:15:00.733 --> 00:15:02.777
But she was having a
hard time breaking it off

00:15:02.819 --> 00:15:03.820
with her old boyfriend.

00:15:03.861 --> 00:15:05.029
[TAKASHI]
No, you're joking!

00:15:05.071 --> 00:15:06.906
[MACHIKO] You think I'm
making this up, too?

00:15:06.948 --> 00:15:09.242
[TAKASHI grunts, gasps]

00:15:09.283 --> 00:15:11.411
[WOMAN 1B]
Yeah. You have to admit, though.

00:15:11.452 --> 00:15:13.538
Matchy really does play to win.

00:15:13.579 --> 00:15:14.414
You're not kidding!

00:15:14.455 --> 00:15:16.332
I hear her husband's a doctor.

00:15:16.374 --> 00:15:21.921
[TAKASHI] No... My god. So that
means the baby is mine?

00:15:21.963 --> 00:15:25.883
I told you I wasn't lying,
but you wouldn't believe me.

00:15:25.925 --> 00:15:28.845
I'm sorry! I admit I was wrong!

00:15:28.886 --> 00:15:30.763
[MACHIKO groans]

00:15:30.805 --> 00:15:32.181
Wait! I didn't mean--

00:15:32.223 --> 00:15:34.475
[MACHIKO]
Get away from me!

00:15:34.517 --> 00:15:35.601
I'll show you!

00:15:35.643 --> 00:15:36.352
[TAKASHI]
Hold on!

00:15:36.394 --> 00:15:37.520
[gasps]

00:16:08.092 --> 00:16:09.427
[MACHIKO gasps]

00:16:12.597 --> 00:16:14.348
[groans]

00:16:17.101 --> 00:16:19.937
[panting]

00:16:19.979 --> 00:16:21.564
The car...

00:16:22.815 --> 00:16:25.485
[grunts]

00:16:25.526 --> 00:16:27.987
[clapping]

00:16:28.029 --> 00:16:31.616
[DECIM] Congratulations.
You are the winner, Machiko.

00:16:31.657 --> 00:16:34.494
And with that, the game
is officially at an end.

00:16:34.535 --> 00:16:36.954
If you would both please
move over this way.

00:16:36.996 --> 00:16:38.706
Just a minute! Please!

00:16:38.748 --> 00:16:40.958
One more throw! Just one!

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.293
[MACHIKO]
There's no point.

00:16:42.335 --> 00:16:43.294
What?

00:16:43.336 --> 00:16:48.049
Stop. There's no
point to any of it.

00:16:48.090 --> 00:16:49.425
What do you mean?

00:16:49.467 --> 00:16:54.013
[MACHIKO] Hey, bartender,
we're already dead now,

00:16:54.055 --> 00:16:55.431
aren't we?

00:16:55.473 --> 00:16:56.682
Huh?

00:16:56.724 --> 00:16:57.683
Yes.

00:16:57.725 --> 00:17:00.478
I'm afraid you have both
left the land of the living.

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:02.772
Following their deaths,
people are either sent

00:17:02.813 --> 00:17:05.483
to Heaven or to Hell.

00:17:05.525 --> 00:17:09.946
That is why Quindecim exists.
To decide who is sent where.

00:17:09.987 --> 00:17:12.907
Only certain pairs are invited
to come here, however.

00:17:12.949 --> 00:17:16.619
You must have died at the
same moment to qualify.

00:17:16.661 --> 00:17:17.912
My apologies.

00:17:17.954 --> 00:17:20.373
I'm sorry for not
having told you earlier.

00:17:30.675 --> 00:17:33.719
[phone ringing]

00:17:33.761 --> 00:17:34.971
Are you gonna answer that?

00:17:35.012 --> 00:17:38.599
Huh? Nah, I don't feel
like talking right now.

00:17:38.641 --> 00:17:40.685
Gimme that. I'll answer for you.

00:17:40.726 --> 00:17:42.228
[MACHIKO]
Jeez! What are you doing?

00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:45.064
Stop it! Watch the road!

00:17:48.401 --> 00:17:50.486
[TAKASHI yells]

00:17:50.528 --> 00:17:51.571
[yells]

00:17:51.612 --> 00:17:53.656
[MACHIKO screams]

00:17:53.698 --> 00:17:55.992
[TAKASHI gasps]

00:17:56.033 --> 00:18:01.956
I remember now. The car.
We fell... so far down.

00:18:01.998 --> 00:18:03.791
How could something
like this happen?

00:18:03.833 --> 00:18:06.127
I just wanted to start
a family! That was all!

00:18:06.168 --> 00:18:08.713
I wanted to be a father.

00:18:08.754 --> 00:18:11.465
[sobs]

00:18:11.507 --> 00:18:13.634
[TAKASHI] And instead
I killed my own child.

00:18:13.676 --> 00:18:16.804
How could this happen?
You're God, aren't you?

00:18:16.846 --> 00:18:18.848
There must be
something you can do!

00:18:18.889 --> 00:18:21.726
I'm sorry. My role is
merely that of arbiter.

00:18:21.767 --> 00:18:23.978
[TAKASHI] I-It's a dream,
right? It has to be!

00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:25.771
Nothing this crazy
could be real!

00:18:25.813 --> 00:18:27.064
[MACHIKO sobbing]

00:18:27.106 --> 00:18:28.024
Shut up!

00:18:28.065 --> 00:18:31.027
Just drop the
innocent act, already!

00:18:31.068 --> 00:18:31.902
[MACHIKO]
What act?

00:18:31.944 --> 00:18:34.155
It's not my child!

00:18:34.196 --> 00:18:36.657
What? Whose do you
think it is, exactly?

00:18:36.699 --> 00:18:40.620
Somebody else's!
Please, it has to be!

00:18:41.787 --> 00:18:44.415
Takashi, please.

00:18:44.457 --> 00:18:49.045
[screaming] Why?

00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:19.492
[sighs]

00:19:24.246 --> 00:19:26.207
[MACHIKO] You know, you're
actually right for once.

00:19:26.248 --> 00:19:28.834
[grunts]

00:19:28.876 --> 00:19:32.755
[MACHIKO] Yeah. I'm in love
with somebody else.

00:19:34.465 --> 00:19:40.638
[MACHIKO laughs]

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:43.265
[MACHIKO]
I mean, it's obvious, isn't it?

00:19:43.307 --> 00:19:44.767
Did you actually think somebody

00:19:44.809 --> 00:19:46.352
would ever fall
in love with you?

00:19:46.394 --> 00:19:47.436
[grunts]

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:49.355
What are you, a complete idiot?

00:19:49.397 --> 00:19:51.774
I didn't want anything
but your money!

00:19:51.816 --> 00:19:53.943
[TAKASHI]
Wait, you mean, you were lying?

00:19:53.984 --> 00:19:56.320
You really were
making it all up?

00:19:56.362 --> 00:20:00.324
Of course I was lying,
moron! I mean, your child?

00:20:02.034 --> 00:20:05.621
[TAKASHI]
Dirty bitch! I'll teach you!

00:20:05.663 --> 00:20:06.914
[yells]

00:20:08.499 --> 00:20:09.583
Damn it!

00:20:11.711 --> 00:20:13.838
What the hell's happening?

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:17.633
The game ended when the
final dart was thrown.

00:20:17.675 --> 00:20:20.428
You think I care
about your damn game?

00:20:20.469 --> 00:20:21.554
Let me out of this!

00:20:21.595 --> 00:20:23.055
[DECIM]
Once more, I am sorry.

00:20:23.097 --> 00:20:24.640
You see, the ruling
has already been made.

00:20:24.682 --> 00:20:28.352
I just wanna hit her once!
Please! Just one time!

00:20:28.394 --> 00:20:29.729
Very sorry.

00:20:29.770 --> 00:20:32.940
[groans]

00:20:35.401 --> 00:20:38.529
[whimpers]

00:20:48.414 --> 00:20:50.750
Well, then, it's
time we were off.

00:20:50.791 --> 00:20:52.710
Come with me, please.

00:20:58.382 --> 00:20:59.592
Thank you for playing.

00:20:59.633 --> 00:21:01.385
Best of luck on your journey.

00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:33.519
Not a bad job, there, Decim.

00:22:33.561 --> 00:22:36.605
[DECIM]
Thank you, I did my best.

00:22:36.647 --> 00:22:38.524
What did you think about it?

00:22:40.025 --> 00:22:41.819
It was pretty awful.

00:22:42.903 --> 00:22:45.155
You will get used to it.

00:22:46.657 --> 00:22:48.868
So where did each of them
end up going, then?

00:22:48.909 --> 00:22:49.994
[NONA]
I'm guessing Takashi's soul

00:22:50.035 --> 00:22:51.370
was sent for reincarnation,

00:22:51.412 --> 00:22:53.372
and Machiko's was
sent into the void.

00:22:53.414 --> 00:22:54.915
Yes.

00:22:54.957 --> 00:22:58.460
[WOMAN]
Oh, I see. Um.

00:22:58.502 --> 00:23:01.463
Maybe you can clear
something up for me.

00:23:14.768 --> 00:23:17.771
