00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,440
off as just that until now.

168
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,040
So what you're telling
me is that my second cousin

169
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:21,320
Kazuma Kannagi, who left
home four years ago, is back?

170
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,160
Mm.

171
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,760
Are you serious?

172
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,600
A member of the Kannagi
family has actually trained

173
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,200
himself to use wind magic?

174
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,040
I can't believe that.

175
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:29,800
It's just so‐‐

176
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,200
It's embarrassing
and shameful.

177
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:37,360
I pity him, despite myself.

178
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,000
He's not had an
easy path in life.

179
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,040
If only he hadn't been born
into the Kannagi family,

180
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,320
he wouldn't have anything
to be ashamed of.

181
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:51,000
But he was, and he didn't have
the ability to control fire.

182
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,720
The Kannagi family
has been practicing

183
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,160
the sacred art of fire magic
for countless generations.

184
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,680
It has no place for those
who can't master it.

Genma.

186
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:04,120
Therefore, Kazuma no longer
has any connection to us

187
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,040
at all.

188
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,280
And as far as I'm concerned,
I have but one son, Ren.

Father.

190
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,080
Perhaps it's for the best.

191
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:18,720
Wind magic may allow Kazuma
to achieve true happiness.

192
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,320
Do you think that he could
ever be a member of our family

You're supposed to
be the heir to the head

This is pathetic.

You've shamed me

Now, leave!

Well, so much for thinking
I've gotten over that.

What was it, Hyoue?

210
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,240
Due to the severity of
the cuts on their bodies,

211
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,920
I've concluded that they
were killed by wind magic.

212
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,840
Not only that, but a type
far more powerful than we

00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,520
in the Fuga Clan use.

They might have
been branch family

217

members, but to think someone
could kill them so easily is‐‐

218
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,680
Unbelievable?

219
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,640
I'm afraid it's much
worse than that.

220
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:57,720

Yes.

224

We of the Fuga Clan have lived
only to serve the Kannagi

Who would attacks
us like this?

227
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,920
It's Kazuma.

How much more
evidence do we need.

229
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,400
Well, it does look
like a grudge slaying,

230
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,280
and the killer used wind magic.

231
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,640
So, I'm going to have
to agree with you

232
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,240
that he would fit the bill.

233
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,280
If you asked me, he
murdered them out of revenge

00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,480
for getting kicked out.

235

It wasn't their
fault he got disowned.

236
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,480
It was his for being weak.

Power is everything
in this family.

He should know that.

Damn that guy.

will be avenged, I swear it.

Father, everyone's
saying that Kazuma

is responsible for the murders.

245
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,360
Now that he's
acquired wind magic,

246
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,440
they think he's using his powers
to take revenge on the family.

247
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,520
If it's true and he is the
one who murdered those boys,

248
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:57,320
you may be certain
that he will pay.

what you're going to do.

We don't yet have any
proof of his guilt.

further orders, is that clear?

it was wind magic.

329
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,560
All right, I know
what'll get rid of this.

330
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,360
Enraiha, come forth!

331
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,000
It wasn't me.

332
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,760
We're done here.

333
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:45,560
No, we're not.

334
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:48,520
Master Jugo has requested
to speak with you in person.

335
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:51,280
If he wanted to talk, he
should've come here himself.

336
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,640
I'm not at his beck
and call anymore.

337
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,400
Tell him I said that.

338
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,400
[EXPLOSION]

339
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,320
So, it's the Fuga Clan
that's been trailing me.

340
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,800
This is your last chance.

341
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,240
Come with us quietly
or else, Kazuma.

342
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,680
Would it kill
you to say please?

343
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,840
Bastard!

344
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:10,640
Die!

345
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:20,280
What in the‐‐ what
in the hell did you do?

346
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,120
Just a little trick I learned.

347
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,320
You Kannagis think
you're invincible.

348
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,520
You're immune to the
heat from an explosion,

349
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,240
but its impact is another story.

350
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,720
How did someone sneak up on me?

351
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,360
That was wind magic.

352
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:54,200
[LAUGHING]

353
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,040
What is going on here?

354
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,200
Spirits of the wind!

355
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,840
What the hell is wrong with you?

356
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,000
That's a breach of our contract.

357
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,680
Great, now what?

358
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,880
Enraiha.

359
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:14,800
Ayano?

360
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,040
Is that you?

361
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,280
Kazuma.

362
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,200
Kazuma!

363
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,080
Hold on, it's not
what it looks like.

364
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,160
I didn't kill them, I swear.

365
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:35,280
You'll pay for this!

366
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,760
Hear me out, would you?

367
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,320
Wow, look at you.

368
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,920
You really have grown up.

369
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:47,000
Flattery will get you
nowhere, you murderer!

370
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,720
You have no idea who you're
messing with, Kazuma.

371
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,120
Actually, I do.

372
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,480
You inherited the Enraiha,
so you're the next head

373
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,320
of the Kannagi family.

374
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,600
I said I didn't do it.

375
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,680
Do you really think I'm gonna
believe a word you're saying?

376
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,720
That's up to you.

377
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,240
I don't care if you
believe me or not.

378
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,240
Somebody killed them.

379
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,720
So if you didn't, then who did?

380
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:26,040
Some other wind magic user.

381
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:30,160
You'll have to find out
the rest on your own.

382
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,840
But I'll be honest with you.

383
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,440
Based on what you've
shown me tonight,

384
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,800
I don't have much hope of that.

385
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,760
Some future head of
the family you are.

386
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:37,800
You've got to be kidding.

387
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,400
You're the last person that
should be talking about family.

388
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,200
Come on.

389
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,680
A Kannagi that
practices wind magic?

390
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,840
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

391
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,840
Not really.

392
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:49,200
I'd love to stay and
chat, but I've got to go.

393
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,360
We'll have to continue
this another time.

394
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,640
Hey, wait a minute!

395
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,760
I won't forgive him.

396
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,480
Not now, not ever.

397
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,280
Kazuma!

398
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,000
Guess I'm in an all out war
with the Kannagi family now.

399
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,480
Could be fun.

400
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,000
But I don't want
to be manipulated

401
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,240
by whoever is behind the
curtain pulling the strings.

402
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:28,640
One thing's for sure, it's
going to be interesting.

403
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:05,800
AYANO: What?

404
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,760
You can't be serious.

405
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,640
This is all Kazuma's
fault, so why am

406
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,240
I the one who's being grounded?

407
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,800
It's not fair!

408
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:14,920
Cousin Genma, I hope you show
that ungrateful excuse of a son

409
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,880
of yours why it's
unwise for him to mess

410
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,480
with the Kannagi family.

411
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,920
No way, he wouldn't be
willing to go that far

412
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,640
to get his revenge, would he?

413
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,080
That's crazy.

414
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:27,520
Next time on Kaze no Stigma,
confrontation with the past.

415
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:31,120
Don't ever underestimate
my powers, Kazuma.
