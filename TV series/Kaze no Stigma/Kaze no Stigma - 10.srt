But this isn't about
the Tsuwabukis, Ren.

the Tsuwabukis but everyone.

meaningless, because I'll

Yes, but listen to me.

All my prayers will
melt into the mountaintop,

181
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,840
and my sacrifice will be
remembered for years to come.

truly wonderful idea to me.

fake ones but real memories.

It sounds strange, but
someone else's experience

That's right.

turns out to be true,

488
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,240
we decided to bring in
Mayumi to pick up the slack.

489
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,600
You can't.

490
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,360
KUREHA: The grand ceremony takes
precedence over everything.

491
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,240
That's the way of
the Tsuwabukis.

492
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,440
I wouldn't worry.

493
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,400
She's only lending
her power to Ayumi.

494
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,800
It's not like
she's going to die.

495
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,760
Unless, of course, there's
some kind of unfortunate

496
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:31,160
interruption and the
seal is released.

497
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,280
What are you talking about?

498
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,880
You mean you haven't heard?

499
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:36,120
An unknown wind magic
user and a pixie

500
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:38,480
infiltrated the Tsuwabuki
palace last evening.

501
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,160
Wind magic user?

502
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,440
Not just an ordinary
wind magic user.

503
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,200
It is highly possible
that he possesses

504
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,440
power equal to my own.

505
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,840
I'm sure he'll return
to disrupt our ceremony.

506
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:56,560
And if that happens,
then Mayumi will, well‐‐

507
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:59,720
I swore I would do everything
I could to protect her.

508
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:02,840
And now there's absolutely
nothing I can do to stop him,

509
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,800
not if he's as
strong as you say.

510
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,360
But think, Yuji.

511
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,480
What if you could be
stronger than he is?

512
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,560
Much stronger.

513
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:17,040
What if you had power, the
power to eliminate your enemies

514
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:20,160
and protect what matters
to you until the very end?

515
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,560
What would you do if
you could have it, Yuji?

516
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,320
What would you do
if I told you that I

517
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:27,200
could give it to you right now?

518
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,200

AYANO (VOICEOVER): As a
Kannagi, even I understand

521
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,440
the importance of the ceremony.

522
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,480
But there's something
strange happening

523
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,080
with the Tsuwabukis right now.

524
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:15,040
Ren, are you positive
this is what you want?

525
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,840
And I'll be by your
side every step

526

of the way to see how things
turn out with you and Ayumi.

Hey, Kazuma, what the
heck are you doing?

528
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,840
Why are you here?
