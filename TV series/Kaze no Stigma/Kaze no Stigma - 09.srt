00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,240
I'm the one in charge of this
family now, do you understand?

494
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,920
Yes, of course.

495
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,880
Tomorrow's the grand ceremony.

496
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,640
If we fail, we are disgraced.

497
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:06,520
And I will do whatever
must be done to protect us.

498
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,640
Oh, yeah, that's right.

499
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,880
I didn't realize it was so soon.

500
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:10,760
What is?

501
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,560
It's their family tradition.

502
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:15,320
It happens every 30 years.

503
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:18,040
The grand ceremony.

504
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:20,640
It's the Tsuwabuki's charge
to protect Mount Fuji

505
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,360
and stop it from erupting.

506
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:25,600
On the first night of the full
moon in a ceremonial year,

507
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,240
the family puts
Mount Fuji to rest.

508
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,680
But the ceremony is
anything but grand.

509
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,720
OK, wait.

510
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:32,840
I don't get it.

511
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,120
Does the pixie
treasure have something

512
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,000
to do with the grand ceremony?

513
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,720
I guess we're
about to find out.

514
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,160
But why else would
they go to the trouble

515
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,400
of stealing your treasure right
in the middle of all this?

Aah!

518
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,320
We have intruders
on the premises.

519
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,160
Take them down.

520
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,760
Capture them at once.

How does she see us?

522
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,200
It doesn't make sense.

523
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,080
She's an earth magic user.

524
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,480
We weren't even on the ground.

Well, well.

527
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:06,280
That was quite a
trick you pulled.

528
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,640
Wasn't exactly your
typical earth magic, huh?

Now, listen up.

536
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,640
Your days of devastating
their homeland end now.

537
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,480
We're here on behalf of
the Chief of the Pixies

538
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,560
to take back what
belongs to them.

539
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,160
There's a fight
coming tomorrow night,

540
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,600
and with it comes the extinction
of your entire family.

541
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,800
Those Tsuwabukis
weren't so tough.

542
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,840
So now what are we gonna do?

543
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,040
We wait.

544
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,480
We'll let those idiots lead
us right to the treasure.

545
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,320
All we need to do now
is sit back and relax.

What?

547
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,800
You really think so?

00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,600
No question about it.

549
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,520
As soon as we pin
down the location

550
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,120
of the secret treasure, I'll
return it to the old pixie

551
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,920
chief then come back
later and do whatever

Yeah, Spirit King,
what were you thinking?

556
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,640
I mean, why in the world
would you have chosen

557
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,240
this guy to be the Contractor?

558
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,600
Do you hear me?

made a big mistake!

Ren went to the ocean?

What is he doing?

00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:11,240
Tsuwabukis, my business
is with Ren, not with you.

564
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,440
Where the heck is Kazuma
when you need him?

565
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,400

That Ayumi girl is a clone?

master of the ceremony.
