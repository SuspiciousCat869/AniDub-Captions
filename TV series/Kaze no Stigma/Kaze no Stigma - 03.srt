Your cousin Genma, our
strongest fire magic user,

170
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:42,000
proved to be no match
against him in a fight.

171
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,440
He lost?

172
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,520
JUGO: That's correct, and
Kazuma could do the same to you.

173
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,360
His powers are far greater.

174
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,920
Accept it.

175
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,440
The Fugas used Kazuma
as a scapegoat,

176
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,760
hoping to divert our attention
away from the real murderer.

177
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,480
They've always been smart.

178
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,200
But why would they
want to kidnap Ren?

179
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,800
Huh?

180
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,680
Why?

181
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,640
Because he is part
of the head family.

182
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,680
Wait.
Kidnapping?

183
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,480
Revenge?

184
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,880
I don't understand what
you're talking about.

185
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,520
You're too young to
know the Fugas' history.

186
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,560
They weren't always
our servants.

187
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,520
In fact, they were
once an organization

188
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:18,080
with power and influence.

189
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,720
How did that change?

190
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,480
300 years ago,
our two families

191
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,080
fought a long and bloody war.

192
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,600
The Kannagis won,
but only because they

193
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,480
were able to seal away the
Fugas' source of power.

194
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,040
But Father, what was it?

195
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:33,840
I know.

196
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,240
It's a spirit.

197
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:38,680
Yes, and they worship
this being as their god.

198
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,880
It's a youma.

199
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,200
A youma?

200
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,920
A powerful and
bloodthirsty one.

201
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,120
No, it can't be.

202
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,480
JUGO: That's right.

203
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,920
Ren has been chosen
to be a sacrifice

204
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,440
for their revived youma.

207

HYOUE (VOICEOVER):
After all this time,

208
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:36,760
we've finally discovered
the location of the seal

209
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:40,720
and have the means to free
our god from his captivity.

210
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,640
In a matter of hours, the
Fuga clan will be a power

211
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,240
to be reckoned with once more.

212
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:52,560
And it's all due to my son,
Ryuya, who was so brave,

213
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,400
he willingly allowed
the evil spirits

214
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,920
that were lingering around
the seal to enter his body.

215
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,680
They might have
been few in number,

216
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,160
but the spirits'
strength was legion.

217
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,800
By becoming their host, Ryuya
gained tremendous power.

218
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,600
Once we release
the seal and free

219
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,080
Lord Gehou from his
confinement, that power

220
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,240
will increase exponentially.

221
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,040
And now that we have a
member of the Kannagi

222
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:30,400
family in our grasp,
that time is almost here.

223
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,440
JUGO (VOICEOVER): Long
ago, the Kannagi family

224
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:36,120
trapped this youma, which
the Fugas call Lord Gehou

225
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:39,000
and confined it with a seal
made out of a particular type

226
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,920
of crystal imbued with
powerful magic, Sanmai Shinka,

227
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,320
a rare elemental fire crystal.

228
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,560
Anyone touching it
will be horribly

229
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,280
burned beyond recognition.

230
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:55,200
However, there are
exceptions to this rule,

231
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,480
namely any immediate members
of the Kannagi head family.

232
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,840
Their bodies can
never be burned.

233
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:11,800
So only by manipulating
one of these Kannagis could

234
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:15,840
the Fuga clan ever break
the Sanmai Shinka seal.

235
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,720
That, in turn, would
free the trapped

236
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,840
youma, which would
then take residence

237
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,520
in the clan's chosen host.

238
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:25,200
In this way, its powers could
be extended to every clan member

239
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,840
making the most
formidable indeed.

240
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:31,920
We now know the intended
host to be Ryuya Kazamaki.

241
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,080
I've reached this
conclusion after studying

242
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:37,320
the ancient texts passed down
through the Kannagi family.

243
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:40,280
But Father, what
will happen to Ren?

244
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,560
After he breaks
the seal for them,

245
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,400
the youma will know he is
descended from those who

246
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:49,280
had imprisoned it and will
then want to take its revenge,

247
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:52,200
no doubt devouring
him completely,

248
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,200
every fragment of
the boy's soul.

249
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,360
Oh no.

250
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,080
JUGO: I'm afraid so.

251
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:00,600
The Fuga clan means
to sacrifice Ren.

252
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,720
All right.

253
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:04,160
I've heard enough.

254
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,000
We have to go find
him, no matter what.

255
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,600
And we can never forgive the
Fugas for what they've done.

256
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,880
All we've ever tried
to do was help them.

257
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,640
You'd think they'd be thankful.

258
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,760
Instead they do this.

259
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,800
It's totally unjustified.

260
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,240
Unjustified, huh?

261
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,720
Are you sure about that?

262
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,600
Of course I am.

263
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,920
And you're not?

264
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,640
What exactly have the
Kannagis done for the Fugas?

265
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,600
Working for the family
sounds good and all,

266
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,280
but they're basically just
slaves to be ordered around.

267
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,280
No way.

268
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:33,680
Our slaves‐‐ we never looked
at the Fuga clan like that.

269
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,000
But you didn't look at
them as equals either.

270
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,520
The Kannagi family broke
a once powerful people

271
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,880
who didn't use fire magic.

272
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,680
The magic they did practice
you considered inferior.

273
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:45,400
And you let the Fugas
know this every day.

274
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,840
Not too different from
my situation, is it?

275
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:50,640
Of course, I only had to put
up with it for a few years.

276
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:54,080
But the Fuga clan's
been doing it for 300.

277
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,160
That's a long time
to hold a grudge.

278
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,360
Now they're pissed
off and want revenge.

279
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,840
Based on what
they've done so far,

280
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,680
seems like they won't
rest until every member

281
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,600
of the Kannagi family's dead.

282
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,040
And guess what.

283
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,480
I don't blame them.

284
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:10,040
I blame the Kannagi family for
pushing them to this point.

285
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:15,240
You're absolutely
correct, Kazuma.

286
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,600
But Father‐‐

287
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,280
As head of the
family, I've tried

288
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:22,600
to rectify the disparities
that have existed for so long.

289
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,600
Sadly, it was not to be.

290
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,560
Yeah.

291
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,880
Now, thanks to this
family, they're

292
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:30,440
going to take Ren's life.

293
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,480
Father, please.

294
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,440
Where is the Fuga clan now?

295
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,240
Just tell me, and
I'll go rescue him.

296
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:38,200
Ayano, you are
not strong enough.

297
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,200
I can't sit here
and do nothing!

298
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,600
I won't let this happen!

299
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,480
I won't!

300
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,320
Ren's a kid.

301
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:46,000
He wasn't put on this earth
to be eaten by some youma!

302
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,680
AYUMI (VOICEOVER): Was I
really put on this earth just

303
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,040
to be eaten by a demon?

304
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,840
Give me the

Hold up.

If you go after them, you
won't make it very far‐‐

308
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,360
not with Ryuya on their side.

309

What you need is backup.

310
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,480
Huh?

311
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,360
And I don't mind providing it.

312
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,280
You what?

313
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,360
Kazuma.

314
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,000
He'll use all his powers to
whip the Spirits of the Wind

315
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,080
into a frenzy.

316
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,440
And when he does, I won't
be able to control them.

317
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,320
See, wind magic isn't enough.

318
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:28,120
But fire magic, that's
a different story.

319
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:31,600
Ryuya could be
destroyed by Enraiha.

320

All right, fine.

321
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Do you think there's
any chance it'll work?

322
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,360
Maybe.

323
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,200
I guess.

324

Excuse me?

00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,400
Really?

00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,000
"I guess," Kazuma?

Helping Ren means
helping the Kannagis,

and Kazuma's made his
feelings clear about that.

But he can't just
let his brother die.

Anger is a powerful tool for
creating energy and fire magic.

With that temper of yours, I can
