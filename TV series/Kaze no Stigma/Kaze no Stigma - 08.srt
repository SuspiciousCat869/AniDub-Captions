[SIGH]

495
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,240
I can't believe it.

496
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,680
They have so much in common.

497
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,760
Yeah, take their
emotional maturity.

498
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,200
I mean, it's like they're
exactly the same age.

499
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,080
That's right.

500
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:01,840
They're five.

501
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,240
TOGETHER: Humph!

502
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,720
I am not as immature as she is!

503
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:08,920
Shut your mouth and
stop interrupting!

504
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,360
[LAUGHTER]

505
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,760
TOGETHER: Quit laughing!

506
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,200
Grr.

507
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,120
Hmph.

508
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,560
Humph.

509
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,640
Hey, don't get upset.

510
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,520
I'll make it up to you
over dinner sometime, OK?

511
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,440
Ooh, did you hear that?

512
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,880
Your next date with
Kazuma's in public.

513
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,440
It's not like that.

514
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,600
It sure is.

515
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,640
I just said it's not!

516
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,800
Look, don't think for a
second that you could take me

517
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,360
to some cheesy fast food joint.

518
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,280
It'd better cost at
least half as much money

519
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,480
as you made on this job.

520
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,720
Are we crystal clear?

521
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,520
No problem.

522
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,720
Whatever makes you feel better.

523
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,560
Now, why don't you
go ahead and tell

524
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,200
us what all the fuss was about?

525
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,880
It's an old man's
dying request.

526
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,520
We're gonna make his last
wish come true tonight.

527
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,520
TOGETHER: An old man?

528
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,560
The demon tree.

529
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,600
OK.

530
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,760
So I guess people really
were hearing whispers

531
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:01,040
and they were made by
the pixies all along.

532
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,240
All right, everyone.

533
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,240
It's time!

534
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,240
[WARBLING]

535
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,400
[WIND WHISTLING]

536
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,720
See ya!

537
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,840
AYANO: Wow, that was
pretty unbelievable.

538
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,000
I'll never be able to look
at the old tree the same way

539
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
again.

540
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,440
And even though it has
been a disaster, to find out

541
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,280
they were protecting
something so beautiful sort of

542
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,280
makes it all OK.

543
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,280
Hmm.

544
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,840
What now?

545
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:27,680
Nothing.

546
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,320
Hey, don't you "nothing" me.

547
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,920
Say it.

548
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,240
The best way to
protect something

549
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,720
is to keep it totally hidden.

550
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,640
And no one's going to search
for it if they don't know

551
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,480
it exists in the first place.

552
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,720
The pixies were causing trouble.

553
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:42,920
That was the only reason we
came here to investigate,

554
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:45,800
meaning what they were
really doing was anything

555
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,760
but protecting that
old cherry tree.

556
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,560
Hold on.

557
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:51,280
Are you trying to tell us
that the pixies aren't smart?

558
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,240
KAZUMA: Actually, it's
just the opposite.

559
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,640
They're pretty clever
when they want to be.

560
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,560
Why did they do it?

561
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,120
Pixies are
relatively innocent,

562
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,600
but they do enjoy
getting into trouble.

563
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,720
The truth is they were
just having a little fun

564
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,240
by doing what they do best‐‐

565
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,320
messing with you.

566
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,800
[GROWL]

567
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:11,280
Those annoying, little bugs!

568
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,680
I know you're still around here!

569
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,600
You can't hide from me forever!

570
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:17,560
So Kazuma, you really knew
what the pixies were up to all

571
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,400
along, right?

572
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,600
But you just
kept it to yourself

573
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,840
because you were
having way too much

574
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,160
fun watching Ayano go crazy.

575
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,400
TOGETHER: Naughty, naughty.

576
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,320
AYANO: Grr!

577
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:28,040
Show yourselves, you
miserable, little menaces!

578
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:30,920
I'm gonna show you what happens
when you play with fire!

579
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,040
AYANO (VOICEOVER): [SIGH]

580
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,400
I never knew until
this exact moment

581
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,760
how absolutely incredible a
meal can taste when someone

582
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,720
else is playing the bill.

583
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,520
Ren, a thief?

584
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,320
Possible.

585
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,640
Someone's obviously
making up lies.

586
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,600
There's no way.

587
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,400
Tsuwabuki?

588
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,240
As in the Tsuwabuki clan?

589
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,880
As in the most powerful
family of earth

590
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,560
magic users in the world?

591
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:28,440
Next time on "Kaze no Stigma,"
"Meeting Under the Moon."

592
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:32,800
And you, could you try dressing
like a decent human for once?
