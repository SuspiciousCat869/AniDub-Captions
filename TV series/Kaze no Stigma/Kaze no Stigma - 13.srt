No.

But since you're here, and we
randomly ran into each other,

99
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,680
we should hang out.

We'll catch up to you later.

Are you sure about that?

104
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,480
Because I'd hate for
Ren to be a third wheel.

around on your date?

You OK?

114
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,240
I thought you wanted
to spend time with Ren?

It's not a big deal.

116
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,760
I don't care if he hangs
out with me, or with them.

to have some fun.

Look at you.

119
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,440
If you keep this up, then
people might start to accuse

you of being a nice person.

121
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,440
And I'd just hate for your
reputation to be ruined.

122
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,640
The only thing that's
going to ruin my reputation

123
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,720
is being seen in
public with you.

124
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,120
What's that mean?

125
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,120
I'm not going anywhere with him!

00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,840

Try not to lose
your temper, Ayano.

And, of course, I'll gladly
pay you extra for your time.

Does that say Dreamland?

134

It's a request from a client.

135
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,480
It could be nothing, but there
may be a spiritual disturbance

136
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,840
at the park.

137
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:10,320
I want you both to go down there
and investigate next Sunday.

138

If it's safe, then you can stay.

139
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,880
Take the day off,
see the sights,

140
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,000
and have a little fun together.

141
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,760
Huh?

142
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,720
What are you talking about?

143
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,520
Why?

144
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:22,080
Spending a day with Kazuma
isn't exactly my idea of fun.

145
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,200
Ayano, that will be
quite enough from you.

146
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,800
Wait‐‐ I've got an idea.

147
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,320
Why doesn't Ren here
just come along with us?

148
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,920
Huh?

149
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,800
Well, it is an
amusement park, right?

150
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,160
Since it's not all
business, why not bring him?

151
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,440
Yeah, that makes sense.

152
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,040
I completely agree with you.

153
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,160
Then it's a done deal.

154
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,240
If Ren wants to.

155
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,040
Yeah.

156
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,400
Sounds like a good time.

157
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,720
Uh, Ren?

158
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:46,120
If you want to go, I have
another pass for you.

159
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,680
Just come see me later
to pick it up, all right?

160
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,480
Oh.

161
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,320
Sure.

162

Ren, are you OK?

00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,440
You seem kind of down.

164

Oh, I guess I
spaced out there.

165

I'm sorry I dragged
you into this today.

501
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,240
AYANO (VOICEOVER): Like I
said, it's not a date, OK?

502
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,480
Kazuma just took
me out and bought

503
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,720
me a very expensive dinner.

504
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,840
That's all.

505
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:14,360
That's a spirit beast
controlled by a fire magic user.

506
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,280
So you really think
you can beat me?

507
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,560
Well, bring it on!

508
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,000
There's no way I'd
let some family

509
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,680
from another country try to
disrespect the Kannagi family.

510
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,360
You understand me?

511
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:27,800
Next time my Kaze No Stigma,
Another Ayano Disaster.

512
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:31,360
Why does this sort of
thing always happen to me?
