Well, no.

328
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,720
Actually it isn't descending at
all because it's already there.

329
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,680
And it's been there the entire
time, right under our noses

330
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,400
in Central Park.

331
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,280
And that means Kazuma
probably knows about it too.

332
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,600
What makes you say that?

333
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,040
This is an email found on
the cell phone of the young man

334
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,520
of Kazuma assaulted earlier.

335
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,680
I just received it.

336
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,480
Kazuma?

337
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,280
You'll earn massive
experience points.

338
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,840
You just have to defeat
this wind magic user.

339
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,360
He's at Central Park.

340
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,120
What exactly does this mean?

341
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,120
Kazuma has been there
ever since the beginning,

342
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,800
when we lost her.

343
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,240
When Utsumi took Nanase.

344
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,920
He must have been
trailing Utsumi.

345
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,720
And that's when he
discovered the location

346
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:36,800
of the New Pandemonium.

347
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,080
Then Bernhardt probably
found out about it.

348
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:43,000
That's why he sent that young
man to fight him, just for fun.

349
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,400
Of course, he didn't
think the young man

350
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,920
stood a chance at all.

351
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:49,440
He was just provoking Kazuma
and laughing at his expense.

352
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,360
But I still don't get it.

353
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,440
Kazuma found
Pandemonium, didn't he?

354
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,800
So why hasn't he attacked yet?

355
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,200
I don't understand.

356
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,800
You see, Kazuma is waiting.

357
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,640
He's waiting for Bernhardt
to finish up the job.

358
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,640
Then Kazuma will
destroy everything

359
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:06,080
moments before he finishes it.

360
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,280
He'll take pleasure
in watching him fail.

361
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:11,000
He'll sit back and relish
in Bernhardt's despair

362
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,680
before he finally
finishes him off.

363
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:17,040
For Kazuma, that would
be the perfect revenge.

364
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,240
Kazuma.

365
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,680
Of course, he's not the
only one enjoying this.

366
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:25,480
Bernhardt loves watching
the drama unfold.

367
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,840
They're eating this up.

368
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,320
It's just a game.

369
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,120
They deal each other cards
of hatred and revenge.

370
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,520
They gamble on each other's
lives and their own.

371
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,120
It's a dark and twisted game.

372
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,160
And now, a new card
has been dealt,

373
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,000
and both players must
make their final move.

374
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,120
The descent of Pandamonium.

375
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,480
We don't have much time left.

376
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,400
All right.

377
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,400
I'll do it.

378
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,000
Kazuma has to be stopped.

379
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,840
Ayano.

380
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:55,320
Now look, I may not
completely understand

381
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,000
what I mean to Kazuma.

382
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,720
But I do know this much.

383
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,440
If there's even the
slightest chance that I'm

384
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:03,160
the key to bringing him
back, I have to do everything

385
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,880
I can no matter what.

386
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,760
And we can't afford to
wait around anymore.

387
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:11,280
So I swear on the
Kannagi's sacred flame,

388
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,800
I'll turn Kazuma around
and bring him back,

389
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,560
not to the past or
thoughts of Tsui‐Ling,

390
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,920
but right here with us.

391
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,920
Thank you, Ayano.

392
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:24,040
Oh, joy, Miss Kannagi
is here to save the day.

393
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,800
Just don't screw it up,
or I'll never forgive you.

394
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,200
So what are you
going to do now?

395
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,000
What?

396
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,360
Your strategy.

397
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,680
How exactly are you going to
rescue him from his own past?

398
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,480
Strategy?

399
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,880
Oh, great, please tell me
you at least have some idea

400
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,760
of what you're going to do.

401
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,760
Hey, it's under control.

402
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,480
Yeah, don't you worry about it.

403
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,920
I'm coming for you Kazuma.

404
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:07,040
Now, old friend, we end this.

405
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,720
I delivered the message
just as I was told.

406
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,640
The seeds will be gathering
down here soon enough.

407
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,440
That's good news, yes.

408
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,320
I want to let you know, I
have no intention of doing

409
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,400
any more errands for you.

410
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,240
Oh really?

411
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,720
But I still have
something I want

412
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,440
you to do for me, my friend.

413
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,440
No thanks.

414
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,120
You see, I don't need
to any more Vesalius.

415
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,720
I have the ultimate power.

416
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:43,680
And now I'm going to
take over this place.

417
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:46,760
Do you really think you
can actually defeat me?

418
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,160
Your power was a gift.

419
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,440
I gave it to you, and
I can take it away.

420
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,720
Feel free to try.

421
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,000
You're no longer my master.

422
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,440
Nanase.

423
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,880
Well, well, where do
you think you're going?

424
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,280
We're just getting started.

425
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,440
You don't want to
miss all the fun.

AYANO: Can I be
completely honest?

430
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:08,640
I've always looked up to
you, from the very beginning.

431
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,480
It'd be great if I could
catch up with you one day

432
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,720
and earn your respect.

433
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:16,600
That's why I can't agree with
what you're doing right now.

434
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,240
I can't believe
I actually wanted

435
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,720
to be something so disgusting.

You know what?
