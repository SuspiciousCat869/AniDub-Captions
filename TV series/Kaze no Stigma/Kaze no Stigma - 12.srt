The beast is too
strong to fight,

so the only thing they
can do is trap it.

And the ceremony confines
the beast by compressing

They treated me like
some kind of freak

couldn't harness any magic.

The only way I could
end their cruelty

was to become
stronger than them.

power was my only choice.

She's doing all this
because she couldn't develop

into a monster.

You can let it out now.

There wasn't anything else
you could have done for her.

Ayumi!

There's so much.

00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,720
There's so much more that I wish
I could have shown you, Ayumi.

499
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:38,080
This world is just so
large and beautiful,

500
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,680
and you barely got to see it.

501
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,080
You know what?

502
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,880
I think you made her
happy for the first time.

503
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,480
They treated her
like she was nothing,

504
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,240
but you showed her that she
was special, that she mattered.

505
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,880
I think she'd thank you.

REN (VOICEOVER): I didn't
have to prove anything to her.

507
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:00,720
She was more special
than anyone I know.

508
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,640
And her words will
never leave my heart.

Hey, Ren!

00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,120
AYUMI (VOICEOVER): And
I love you, too, Ren.

AYANO (VOICEOVER): What
are you talking about?

513
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,120
You want me to
spend an entire day

514
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,480
at an amusement
park with Kazuma,

515
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,160
and it's supposed to be fun?

516
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,520
Why is my heart
pounding like this?

517
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,560
Quiet down.

518
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,560
I hope Kazuma doesn't hear it.

519
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:19,040
You have to admit, there's
something weird going on here.

520
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,120
We haven't found any
spiritual disturbances.

We can't get in
touch with my father.

522
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:25,040
And to top it off,
someone's been following us.

523
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:27,280
Next time on "Kaze
no Stigma," "Let's Go

to the Amusement Park!"

And here's the death sentence
for all Peeping Toms!
