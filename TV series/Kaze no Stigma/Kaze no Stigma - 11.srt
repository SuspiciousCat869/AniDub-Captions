Why do you look like that?

It's simple.

00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,560
I chose this path.

200
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,160
I look like this because
I finally have power‐‐

201
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:34,080
the power to defend
what I love most.

You did all this for Mayumi?

If the grand

her life will be
in grave danger.

And I won't let that happen.

209
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,400
That's why Kureha gave me this
power in the first place‐‐

210

to make sure that
nothing stands in our way

and that the ceremony is
successful and Mayumi is safe.

A child like you could
never understand this,

own life to see it fulfilled.

But somehow, the things he's
saying just don't seem‐‐

yourself for love,

What?

If you sacrifice yourself,
you're only causing pain.

Pain to yourself and then
pain to your loved ones.

gone, you'll never

AYANO: Kureha
wasn't ever planning

486
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,000
on sealing the beast away.

487
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,440
Kazuma, don't you realize
what you've done, you idiot?

488
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,240
What?

489
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,520
You know the Kannagis can't
go up against the beast of Mt.

00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,800
Fuji.

491
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,720
Don't tell me Ayumi's
about to start

492
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,240
the grand ceremony right here.

493
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,040
No!

494
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:23,360
If you do that, then you'll‐‐

495
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,920
next time on "Kaze No Stigma,"
"Confession Under the Moon".

496
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:30,320
Can that thing get any bigger?
