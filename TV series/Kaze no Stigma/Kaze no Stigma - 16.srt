00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,440
It says "unisex bath."

167
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:20,240
So it's for girls and guys?

168

[SCREAMING]

169
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,560
That was an overreaction.

170
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,880
OK, I just need to calm down.

171
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,320
It was a little
surprising to see him.

172
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:42,880
And it was even more surprising
to see so much of him.

173
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,240
But it hardly seems proper that
they would have unisex baths.

174
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,720
No matter how much
time I spend here,

175
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,000
I learn something new about
this country every day.

176
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,440
Is anybody else starving yet?

177
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:59,480
Yeah, I think
it's time to eat.

178
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,320
And we probably
shouldn't wait for Kazuma.

179
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,680
Who knows what he's up to?

180
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,840
I think I've been
in here long enough.

181
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,600
Hey, old man.

182
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,200
Kazuma.

183
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,000
Huh.

184
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,200
So how long have you
been back from the dead?

185
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,600
That's just wishful thinking.

186
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,000
I was never dead.

187
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,920
Oh yeah, that's right.

188
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,520
I forgot that
useless son of yours

189
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,440
decided to let you
live after all.

190
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,240
I just figured you were so
embarrassed that you would

191
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,520
have killed yourself by now.

192
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:47,680
You shouldn't flatter
yourself over a single victory.

193
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,360
Your arrogance is
only gonna make

194
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,920
it that much more
humiliating when

195
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,480
I defeat you the next time.

196
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,600
Oh, next, time?

197
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,000
Well, if, you insist,
I'd be more than

198
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,760
happy to kick your ass again.

199
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,640
You're a fool.

200
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,040
If you really
wanna test how much

201
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,360
luck you've got
left in you, then

202
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,840
what are we waiting for, boy?

Come on, is that all you've got?

204
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,680
You're pathetic!

Well, you've got
some pretty impressive

moves for a senior citizen!

207
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,880
It's too bad you
haven't made any progress

208
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:33,840
since you were a child!

00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,640
Father?

What is he doing here?

211
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,160
I had a weird feeling
something bad was gonna happen,

212
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,160
but I never thought
it was gonna be this.

213
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,160
Didn't they already
settle this fight?

214
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,640
They fought, but
they never settled it.

215
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,640
I guess this is my father's
return match or something.

216
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,640
Do you think maybe we
should try to stop this?

217
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,160
Yeah, but I have no idea how.

218
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,680
It'd be suicide to get in
between the two of them.

219

But you're the only
one that can, Ren.

Kazuma and Cousin
Genma care about you

221
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,240
more than anything in the
world, and neither of them

222
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,400
would hurt you.

223
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,520
So they have to stop
fighting if you jump in there

224
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,000
and tell them to knock it off.

But what if they
don't see me somehow?

Well, it'll probably be
a quick and painless death.

Yeah, that's not
exactly reassuring.

Excuse me, Genma,
but your dinner's

00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,880
gonna get cold if
you keep this up.

I don't wanna wait
all night to eat,

so why don't you come up now?

this, I could easily kill

How could I eat anything
after hearing that?

Where to?

Would you like to come with us?

The brochure says that
they've got a full arcade

Yeah, sounds good.

Why isn't Kazuma with you?

Yeah, he said he needed
to cool down after the fight

Cousin Genma might
wanna cool down too!

You'll have to do a lot
better than that, boy!

Looks like we're too late.

As much as they
both hate to admit it,

they're undeniably

Better enjoy this, 'cause
it's the last fight you're ever

Not the way you want it to.

Hope you have better
luck in the next life.

Excuse me, Genma.

The outdoor bath is
only open until 11:00.

298
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,160
If you keep this up, you're
not gonna have time for a soak,

00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,000

Don't worry, kid.

You're next on my list.

306
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,360
You might wanna go ahead
and scratch me off that list

307
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,360
now, while you can still
use your hand to write.

308
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,840
This fighting is exhausting.

309
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:19,520
I'm gonna have to take a hot
bath just to calm myself down.

Enjoy.

Relaxing, isn't it?

It's incredible how the hot
springs wash your worries away.

313

What do you have
to be worried about?

314
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,840
Nothing, really.

315

My useless son's been giving me
problems, but what else is new?

I know how you feel.

Except I've been having
problems with my dad.

Well, my son is a
arrogant, pig‐headed fool.

a heartless jerk.

for anybody except himself.

He demands respect, like
some kind of dictator.

loser who whines like a child.

He's a feeble old man who's
too proud to admit his age.

We took a bath together

more comfortable in the nude.

00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:53,760
You know, I was terrified of
my father when I was younger.

486
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,400
I never thought that I was
gonna be able to defeat him.

487
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,040
I guess everything changes, huh?

488
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,080
I'm sorry you've
had to deal with this.

489
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,560
You don't need to apologize.

490
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,920
Although I must admit I'm
a little surprised at how

491
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,000
much he was able to injure you.

492
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,880
Maybe I'm wrong, but I get
the feeling that you're

493
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:12,800
actually proud of him.

494
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:15,640
He's got a long way to go
before he earns my respect.

495
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:18,400
KAZUMA: It's pathetic that
he's still fighting at his age.

496
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,880
He really should just
go ahead and retire.

497
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:21,840
TACHIBANA: Hey, wait.

498
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,680
Genma, where are you going?

499
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,920
AYANO: Get back here, Kazuma.

500
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,240
Where are you going?

501
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,240
KAZUMA AND GENMA: To the bath!

502
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:35,480
[THEME MUSIC]

503
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:05,560
AYANO (VOICEOVER): What?

504
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:08,320
Someone put a curse on the
girls in the tennis club?

505
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,320
Wait.

506
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:13,400
It's that low‐life camera geek
from Nanase's class, isn't it?

507
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,920
There's something weird
about all these people

508
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,880
developing special abilities.

509
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,880
This kind of thing
doesn't just happen.

510
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:19,680
Oh no!

511
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,800
Nanase's in trouble?

512
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:26,440
Next time on Kaze no Stigma,
"How to Defeat a Magic User."

513
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,240
What?

514
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:30,320
Kazuma's involved with this?
