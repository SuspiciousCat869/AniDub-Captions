Did you kill him?

No, he's fine.

329
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:41,560
If I'd hit him straight on,
it would have obliterated him.

No matter what, I beat him.

Yeah.

So I guess that makes
you and me officially even.

I figured it'd be best to go
ahead and settle the score now.

How can you even
walk after that attack?

Well, I managed to deflect it.
