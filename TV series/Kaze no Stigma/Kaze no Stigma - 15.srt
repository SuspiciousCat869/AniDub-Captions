165
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,000
Come on.

166
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Here it comes.

167
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,240
You got something
to say to me?

168
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,080
Here.

169
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,680
Huh?

170
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,120
I've been challenged to a duel?

171
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,800
This is from Catherine McDonald.

172
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,160
I thought she went
back to the States?

173
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,240
The duel's happening
a week from today.

174
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,080
What?

175
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,400
She'll leave, and you'll never
see her again if she loses.

176
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,200
Wait.

177
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:21,120
I bet that was the blonde woman
I saw Kazuma with earlier.

178
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,200
Don't tell me you've been
spending time with her!

179
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,200
Well, yeah.

180
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,840
I'm coaching her.

181
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,880
I've been training
her for the past week.

182
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,400
I thought you
were my bodyguard!

183
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,800
I never signed an
exclusive contract.

184
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:34,800
‐ Yeah, but‐‐
‐ Later.

185
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:35,600
Hey!

186
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:39,200
I'm still talking to you!

187
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,000
Well, I don't think
you have to worry.

188
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,040
It doesn't sound like
they started dating yet.

189
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:45,160
How many times do
I have to tell you?

190
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:45,920
I don't care.

191
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,800
I'd say you're
definitely improving.

192
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,120
Are you really surprised?

193
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,480
I guess it is tough
to improve perfection.

194
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,160
But do you really think
all of this training

195
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,240
will help me defeat Ayano?

196
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,720
You've got a better chance
than relying on Metatron.

197
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,800
The only strategy Ayano
has is to take out

198
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,600
her opponent in a single blow.

199
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:12,480
Sorry to compare you two, but
you're pretty damn similar.

200
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,240
If you have the same
technique, it all comes

201
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,720
down to the weapons you use.

202
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,760
A spirit beat can't
compete with Enraiha,

203
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,600
so you've got to switch
up your game plan if you

204
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,080
want to catch her off guard.

205
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,800
Well, I guess
that makes sense.

206
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,760
It totally goes
against my style,

207
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,120
but I'll do it if you
think it will help me win.

208
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:27,880
All right.

209
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,600
You can take it on
your own from here.

210
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,400
What?

211
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:33,120
I gave you your
homework, so get to it.

212
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,440
I'm going to go get
something to eat.

213
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,400
You can't just leave me
here while you go home.

214
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,600
Don't walk away from me!

Sorry.

I just wasn't looking.

I understand that
someone else has

225
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,000
stepped up to challenge Ayano.

226
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,640
Yeah, I heard
something about that.

227
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,480
And she's from a
well‐known American

228
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,160
family of fire magic users.

229
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,440
So she's Ayano's direct enemy?

230
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,480
More or less.

231
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,040
But I think Ayano could
benefit from a different type

232
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,320
of competition.

233
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,160
What?

234
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:48,400
Perhaps, if this girl were
to challenge her true feelings,

235
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:53,560
Ayano would be a little nicer
to Kazuma before it's too late.

236
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,600
Right.

237
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,080
Stupid Kazuma!

00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,680

Yeah.

Whatever.

That's the last thing
I'm worried about.

KAZUMA: I don't really
see why you need me here.

I hope you're prepared
for our duel tomorrow.

Of course not.

Kazuma's such a
fantastic coach.

Don't stand there

My point is, no
matter what happens,

328
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,680
I promise nothing will stop me
from defeating her tomorrow.

00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,760
I'll make Kazuma

From now on, it's

He's going to spend every
last penny he makes on me.

[SIGH] Is she ever going to
find out what she really wants?

345

At least she realized
she wants something.

346
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,320
I promise you I will win.

347

I'll win just so I can
ruin Kazuma's life.

You can do it!

CATHERINE: Of course I'm ready.

AYANO: Not as ready as I am.

355

I summon you, my spirit
guardian, Metatron!

358
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,320
You're really going to use
that thing again after what

359
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,480
happened the last time?

360
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,840
And why not?

361
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:12,320
Then let's go.

You're awesome, Ayano!

365
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:31,000
The flame of purification.

366
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,440
No real surprise there.

367
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,640
That all you got?

368
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:37,040
I hope you didn't spend too
much money on Kazuma's training.

AYANO: What are those things?

372
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,880
They're called wisps.

373
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:00,360
What?

374
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:03,720
So are they supposed to be your
new spirit beasts or something?

375
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:06,640
They don't look quite as
impressive as your other one.

376
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,480
I'm not the person you
should be telling that to.

377
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,920
They might look measly, but
the wisps are part of Kazuma's

378
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,760
strategy to defeat you.

379
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:18,440
Let's start the real
battle now, shall we?

380
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,560
No, she's losing.

381
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:29,240
Hey, Ayano, you have
to counterattack!

382
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,040
Don't think so.

383
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,520
The only way she
knows how to fight

384
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,720
is to take out her
opponent with one blow.

385
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,080
She's completely clueless
dealing with multiple targets.

386
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:42,240
You might even say
it's her Achilles heel.

387
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,160
Did you tell Catherine that?

388
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,400
Did you set up Ayano?

389
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,640
Of course I did.

390
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,040
So?
I'm her coach.

391
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:48,800
That's terrible.

392
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,520
You jerk.

393
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:53,280
Well, Ayano might end
up getting her ass kicked,

394
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,280
but at least she'll
learn something from it.

395
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,600
She might even realize
what her weakness is.

396
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:06,920
NANASE: Ayano!

397

YUKARI: Is she all right?

398
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,440
This looks to be
the end of our battle,

399

so feel free to admit
your defeat at any time.

Well, that makes my victory
that much more enjoyable.

Oh, I can't wait to start
my new life with Kazuma.

I have a feeling he's just
going to love America.

405
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,400
The first thing
I'll do, of course,

406
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,120
is bring him to our estate
and introduce him to Daddy.

407
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,840
And afterwards, I'll throw
an extravagant welcome party

408

for him.

409

I'm certain we'll be as
happy as humanly possible

with each other.

wonderful life together.

realize when to quit?

About time she started
acting like herself.

That's the real Ayano.

won't let you take Kazuma.

focus on just one thing.

I have every right to
remain in this country.

491
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,240
You are such a liar!

492
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,000
You said you would
leave if I won.

493
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,640
Well, it's your
word against mine.

494
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,480
So when do we start
training, Kazuma?

495
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,360
I can't believe this.

496
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,320
You just admitted your defeat!

497
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,600
Well, yes, but that was
an entirely different thing.

498
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,440
Was not!

[UNCOMFORTABLE LAUGHING]

Fight's over.

501
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,320
OK?

502
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,880
Here they go.

503
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:15,720
Because it ended!

504
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,600
You can't do that!

505
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,400
Oh?

506
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,240
You heard me.

507
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,640
Then we'll have another
match right now!

508
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,440
CATHERINE: Fine.

509
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,240
Bring it on!

510
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,240
I'd be glad to teach
you some manners.

511
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,480
You can't just order a man
to buy you food like that.

512
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,840
AYANO: Oh, yeah?
Says who?

513
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:29,800
CATHERINE: Says me!

514
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,600
Let's go, Kazuma.

517
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,240
This is amazing!

518
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,400
I can't believe you won a
free trip to the hot springs

from a quiz show.

520
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,200
You're so lucky, Yukari.

521
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,000
What?

522
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,400
Kazuma and Catherine were
taking a bath together?

523
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,600
And what's Kazuma's
father doing here?

524
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,880
I thought they didn't get along.

525
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,000
They got into a fistfight
with each other?

526

Oh, great.

I don't care if you did
take a bath with him.

Don't talk to me like that.
