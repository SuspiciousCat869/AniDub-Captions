of spoiled brats.

Um, I didn't do anything yet.

We've got company.

169

AYANO: That's a spirit beast.

170
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,720
I've never seen one
like that before.

171

How did that thing get in here?

CATHERINE: I think they've
had all they can take, Azazel.

175
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,440
That's a good boy.

176
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,440
You showed them who's in charge.

177
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,400
I wish I could say the same
thing about you, Miss Kannagi.

178
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:31,200
After all I've heard,
I expected much more.

Oh, you'll have to forgive me.

180
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:36,160
I should have introduced
myself already.

181

My name is Miss
Catherine McDonald.

182
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,840
Like you, my
reputation precedes me.

183
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,680
My family is quite
famous in America,

184
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,200
as I'm sure you already know.

I've never heard of it.

The McDonalds are
the most respected

00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,200
fire magic users in the States.

188
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,400
When it comes to controlling
spirit beasts with fire,

189
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,720
they're the best in the country.

190
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,560
Correction.

191
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,280
We are the best in the world.

192
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,240
Our technique allows us
to harness the strength

193
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,560
of multiple spirits into
one virtual character

194
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,600
that only we have
the power to unleash.

195
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,000
It's an elegant technique
a pathetic fire magic user

196
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,680
like you could never master.

197
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,720
Oh, I get it.

198
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,000
So basically, you
and your people

199
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,800
can't handle things
on your own, huh,

200
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,480
so you conjure up a
virtual whipping boy

201
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,320
to do your dirty work for you.

202
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,720
Hm.

203
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,800
That's hilarious, coming
from the person who sat there

204
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,120
like a bump on a log while
those terrorists wreaked havoc

205
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,840
on all those innocent people.

206
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:25,440
[GASP] I was gonna
take care of it.

207

I just wanted to
finish my dinner first.

208
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,160
Maybe those
hooligans were right.

209
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,360
You're nothing but a
spoiled little brat.

210
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,720
What?

211
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,520
Regardless, it is destiny that
we met each other here tonight,

212
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,360
Kannagi.

213
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,520
You're the reason
I'm here, you know.

214
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,800
As a matter of
fact, I was planning

215
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,720
on dropping by your house
later and paying a visit

216
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,000
to the head of your family.

217
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,240
My house?

218
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,000
You and the rest
of the Kannagi family

219
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,240
bear the title of being the
most powerful fire magic

220
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,760
users in the world,
and I'm here to take

221
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,160
that honor away from you.

222
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,640
I don't understand.

223
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,160
And that's not all, princess.

224
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,280
Aside from stripping your
family of their reputation,

225
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,360
I want you to hand over
your sacred weapon,

226
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,840
since the title will soon
be mine Enraiha will be too.

227
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,680
Is this some
kind of sick joke?

228
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,720
If you hand over the sword
and get down on your knees

229
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,360
and beg for mercy, I
promise I won't hurt you.

230
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,120
Because let's face it, if
you don't have the courage

231
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,920
to stand up to a
group of petty thugs,

232
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,200
I doubt you'd care to
try your hand with me.

233
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,080
Oh, really?

234
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,520
Well, I hate to
disappoint you, but if you

235
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,680
think I'm intimidated by
your virtual fire magic,

236
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,600
you're crazy.

237
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,000
And I promise you this much.

238
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,120
I'll die before I hand
over the sacred name

239
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,240
and title of the Kannagi
clan to some random family.

240
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,040
What?

241
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,680
You'd better take that back.

242
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,560
Just because we haven't
been around as long as you

243
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,840
doesn't mean you're better.

244
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,280
Our techniques are newer,
stronger, and more advanced

245
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,600
than anything you
Kannagis can conjure.

246
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,840
Aw.

247
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:51,760
I'm sure you worked your poor
little fingers to the bone,

248
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,560
but it's a little cocky
to challenge the family

249
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,040
chosen by the Spirit King.

250
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,640
What did you say to me?

251
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,600
So how about you get down
on your knees and surrender,

252
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,800
and maybe I'll let you live.

Why, you little‐‐

Hm.

255
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,720
Since you clearly have no
respect for the McDonald clan,

256
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,760
I guess I have no
choice but to show you

257
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,040
exactly what we're capable of.

258
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,120
Looks like I'm gonna have to
get in the middle of this cat

259
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,000
fight.

260
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,480
So much for a quiet evening.

261
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,920
Here it comes.

262
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,120
Allow me to introduce Metatron!

263
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,120
What do you think?

264
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,840
This is Metatron, the
ultimate virtual spirit beast,

265
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,400
conjured by my fire.

266
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,320
And he's under my control.

267

AYANO (VOICEOVER):
With her technique,

268
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,280
there could be hundreds,
maybe thousands

269
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,280
of spirits bundled into one.

270
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,040
What am I supposed to do?

271
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,000
I don't even know if Enraiha
will be able to cut him down.

272
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,080
Unless‐‐

273
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,440
Do you seriously think
your fire attacks will work

274
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,400
on another fire magic user?

275
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,760
You must really
think I'm a fool.

276
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,280
You see, Metatron's
fire is a special type.

277
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,560
While your fire magic
will be rendered useless,

278
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,280
his heterogeneous
flames will burn

279
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,480
you 'til there's nothing left.

280
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,720
I hope you're ready,
'cause here I come!

282
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,000
Did you just see that?

283
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:48,760
Yeah.

284
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,560
So big deal.

285
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,520
It moves differently.

286
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,320
What'd you expect?

287
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,680
It's just a spirit beast.

288
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,080
Shut up.

289
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:57,760
Let's see how this stands up
to a little fire from Enraiha!

290
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:02,280
Now try this on for size!

291
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,800
That all you got?

292
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:04,840
I should ask you the same.

293
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,280
Ah!

294
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,240
AYANO (VOICEOVER):
It makes sense.

295
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,440
That thing is a massive
bundle of spirits.

296
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:21,480
It's not gonna die just
because I slash it.

297
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,840
Hm.

298
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:23,720
Hey, Kazuma.

299
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,000
Just out of curiosity.

If you were in my
position, how would you

301
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:29,400
go about beating this thing?

302
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,200
Hey!

303
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,360
Kazuma?

304
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,560
CATHERINE: If I were you, I
wouldn't look away like that.

305
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,640
Are you ready to give up
and hand over the title,

306
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,760
or do you want more?

307
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,400
I will never give up.

[PHONE RINGING]

309
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,080
A fight?

310
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,400
Between two fire magic users?

311
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,200
WOMAN (ON PHONE): Yes.

312
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,680
And judging by the
information that's

313
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,880
coming in from witnesses, one
of them is definitely Ayano.

314
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,040
Impossible.

315
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,080
Look.

316
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,480
I'm very sorry, but it
happens to be the truth.

317
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,160
And there's one other thing.

318
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,280
I just received
word that they're

319
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,680
fighting inside of
a building that's

320
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,880
been possessed by an evil aura.

321

JUGO (VOICEOVER): What
exactly are we talking about?

322
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,600
We're not positive yet.

323
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,840
It looks like it can't
harm anything directly,

324
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,040
but it appears to be a
somewhat malignant aura that

325
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,880

00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:41,800
That's harassment.

492
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,240
Not OK!

493
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,080
You jerk.

494
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:44,880
I hate you.

495
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,720
I hate you so much.

496
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,280
Don't you ever touch me again.

497
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,240
JUGO: Yes.

498
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:56,080
The Kannagi family will gladly
pay for all of the damage.

499
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:56,880
No, please.

500
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,720
I insist.

501
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,320
Send the bill directly to me.

502
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,120
Thank you.

503
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:03,000
You've been very gracious.

504
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:03,920
I'm confused.

505
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,440
Was there some kind of mistake?

506
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,720
What's the deal?

507
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,560
No, it‐‐ well, you
might say that.

508

509
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,920
AYANO: So you're
positive Catherine's

510
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,440
still in the country?

511
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,720
This is ridiculous.

512
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,240
No matter what she does or how
many times she challenges me,

513
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,560
there's no way she
can take me down.

514
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:14,360
What?

515
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,440
Kazuma's coaching her?

516
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:20,000
He said he's going to America
with Catherine if I lose?

517
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,840
What are you talking about?

518
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:26,600
Next time on "Kaze no
Stigma," Catherine returns.

519
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:30,120
I'll take her down and
ruin Kazuma's life!
