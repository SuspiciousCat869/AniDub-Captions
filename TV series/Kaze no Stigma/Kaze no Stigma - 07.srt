There's no way someone like
you could defeat Kazuma Yagami.

142
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,800
It's simply impossible.

143

But you‐‐ I don't understand.

144
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,440
You said that I had
absorbed enough energy.

145
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,040
You said I was ready.

146
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,480
So I did.

147
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:30,120
The truth is that your ability
to harness and control energy

148
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,000
is determined at birth.

149
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,440
It's sweet that you
put your faith in me,

150
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,760
but you'll never
be able to use all

151
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,240
the power that you collected.

152
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,080
You must have known.

153
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,120
You come from a
family of magic users.

154
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,160
You've just ignored
reality, haven't you?

155
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,280
This can't be.

156
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,080
You promised.

157
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,240
You told me I could!

158
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,480
I simply told you everything
that you wanted to hear, Misao.

159
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,240
Never doubt the human
capacity for self‐delusion.

160
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,800
Once they've got their
minds set on something,

161
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,080
they'll believe anything
that they want to believe.

162
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,280
And as long as you
agree with them,

163
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,680
you can convince them
of just about anything.

164
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:02,480
Like, for example‐‐
there's nothing

165
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,880
wrong with what you're doing.

166
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,800
It's not a sin if
your wish is pure.

167
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,480
The desire for vengeance
is righteous in God's eyes.

168
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,520
You can do anything you
want, because your wish

169
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,080
is the only thing that matters.

170
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,640
Slaughter hundreds
of innocent people.

171
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,480
Their lives are insignificant
compared to your revenge.

172
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,520
Why, you can even murder
your entire family

173
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,080
if they get in your way.

174
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,280
God himself says it's so.

175
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,880
Please, no‐‐ that can't be.

176
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,800
It's not true!

177
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,880
But you believed
it, didn't you?

178
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:39,280
You took the lives of hundreds,
and you did it for nothing.

179
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,080
No!

180
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,520
Misao!

181
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,400
Get away from her!

182
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,720
Whoa!

183
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,480
That aura is really vicious.

184
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:58,200
It's all the energy
Misao's gathered.

185
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,000
It's the collective
energy of her victims

186
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,200
that she can't control
while unconscious.

187
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,720
Now it's pouring out
of her like somebody

188
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,120
squeezing liquid from a sponge.

189
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,400
And this guy standing
right there to soak it

190
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,480
up and harness it for himself.

191
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,840
So you suckered her into
doing your dirty work?

192
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,240
That was the plan.

193
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,880
I needed a medium strong enough
to harvest the energy for me,

194
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,360
like a Kannagi.

195
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,240
It was truly a
fortunate coincidence

196
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,240
that Misao and I both wanted
the power to defeat you, Kazuma.

197
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,360
Is that so?

198
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,880
Wanna tell me why?

199
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,760
Forgive me.

200
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,640
I still haven't
introduced myself.

201
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,920
My name is Michael.

202
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,840
Michael Harley.

203
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:37,080
I have been selected to defeat
you, and nothing will stop me.

204
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:40,120
Tonight you will die in the
name of stars and wisdom.

205
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,400
Wait, what?

206
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,640
In the name of stars and wisdom?

207
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,520
That's right.

208
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:47,120
You may well have overheard
my master say it before, since

209
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,120
you're actually related to him.

210
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,880
I'm quite certain it
sounds familiar to you.

211
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,480
Think hard, Kazuma.

212
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:57,360
You cannot bury your
feelings forever.

213
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,760
Let my words be heard.

214
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,760
In the name of stars and wisdom,
I shall pursue only the truth.

215
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,320
Thank you for reminding me.

216
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,840
And to show my appreciation,
how about I send you

217
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:14,440
to hell so you can join him?

218
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,200
I'm afraid I'm not
going anywhere, Kazuma.

219
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,480
What?

220
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,920
It is truly magnificent.

221
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,160
Would you ever have
guessed that you

222
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,480
could create a
monster out of such

223
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:52,200
a sweet little girl like Misao?

224
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,120
You'll never defeat it, Kazuma.

225
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:58,240
Your meager wind magic skills
are no match for a dragon.

226
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,680
Oh, and be careful.

227
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,680
Destroying the beast
will destroy her, too.

228
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,320
So, Misao's a
part of that thing?

229
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,880
Then how are you supposed to
attack it without hurting her?

230
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:17,040
What about the
Kannagis' purifying fire?

231
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,320
You should be able
to use it to burn

232
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,040
the dragon without harming her.

233
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,080
Great idea.

234
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,000
But maybe you should come up
with a plan that one of us

235
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:23,920
can actually pull off.

236
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:24,720
What?

237
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,320
That kind of magic
takes years to master.

238
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:30,560
Only my father and
Genma know how to do it.

239
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,160
‐You're useless.
‐Oh, yeah?

240
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,040
Look who's talking!

241
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,440
OK‐‐ are you still serious
about trying to save Misao?

242
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,600
Of course I am.

243
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,880
I don't care what happens, but
I'm not going to let her die.

244
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:49,320
But Kazuma‐‐ if you
want to stop this thing,

245
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,080
then I'd better give
it everything I've got!

246
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,560
Ayano, wait!

247
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:02,040
[SHOUTING]

248
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:08,520
I don't get it!

249
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,680
Why does he care so much?

250
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,040
What is it about Misao?

251
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,080
Is he acting this way because
he's in love with her?

252
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:20,840
Why?

253
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,120
Oh, no!

254
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,480
Did the bad dragon scare you?

255
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,400
Open your eyes.

256
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,480
Wait‐‐ Kazuma?

257
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,320
AYANO (VOICEOVER: Did
he actually rescue me?

258
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,640
Get away from them!

259
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:44,360
Thanks for the hand, Ren.

260
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,520
Why'd you even do that?

261
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,240
If you want to save
Misao so badly,

262
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,120
why'd you waste
your energy on me?

263
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,840
I don't really see any
reason why you should

264
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,440
have to die for me to save her.

265
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,240
What?

266
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,640
Make up your mind.

267
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,680
Whose side are you on?

268
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,560
Why are you always
talking about sides?

269
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,440
I've got the power to
protect all of you,

270
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,320
and that's what I'm going to do.

271
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,920
Protect all of of us?

272
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,240
But I thought‐‐

273
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,920
I didn't acquire this
power to let people die.

274
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,600
I have a responsibility
to protect others now.

275
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:16,200
I'm going to save Misao, but
I'll still defend you and Ren.

276
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,040
The only person
that's going to die

277
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,520
is that cocky little
bastard back there.

278
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,800
That all right with you?

279
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,280
Yeah, of course.

280
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,360
Sounds good to me.

281
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,560
Kazuma!

282
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,400
Are you OK?

283
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,240
What's wrong?

284
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,440
You're bleeding.

285
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,480
This happened when you
rescued me, didn't it?

286
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,280
It's nothing.

287
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,400
I'm OK.

288
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,360
No you're not.

289
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,720
You've been hurt.

290
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,520
And right now you've
gotta stop the bleeding,

291
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,320
and try to recover.

292
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,800
Ren and I will hold
'em off until you

293
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,720
get back on your feet, OK?

294
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,800
I can't just leave you two
to deal with this on your own.

295
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,720
Listen, idiot, you want to
protect Misao, don't you?

296
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,840
And you just told me you're
going to protect me and Ren.

297
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,560
Well, you're not doing us
any good bleeding to death.

298
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,320
You made a promise, and
I'm holding you to it.

299
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,280
So you'd better stay out of
the way until you've recovered,

300
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,880
or you're going to
have to deal with me!

301
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,720
Kazuma?

302
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,800
Know what?

303
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,280
I think you might actually
turn out to be a damn fine

304
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,720
woman one of these days, kid.

305
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,840
Uh‐‐ what do you mean,
I might turn out to be?

306
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,240
Thanks for the
lack of confidence,

307
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,720
but I know I'll be a good woman.

308
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,280
I guess we'll just have to see.

309
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:26,120
Now, give me five minutes.

310
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,480
Just keep him busy.

311
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,280
You're putting up a
pretty good fight, Ren.

312
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,600
I'm trying.

313
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,480
Is that Kazuma's blood on you?

314
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,320
Yeah, but don't worry.

315
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,160
He's going to be OK.

316
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,480
Your brother's strong.

317
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,000
We've just gotta hold off
the dragon a little longer.

318
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,360
Right.

319
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,440
You up for this?

320
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,920
I was starting to get a little
worried about you back there.

321
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:57,720
Sorry, Ren.

322
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,320
I'm much better now.

323
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,160
So let's take care
of this thing.

324
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:01,920
Got it!

325
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,920
Hear me, spirits of the wind.

326
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:18,520
In the name of the contract,
entrust me with your power.

327
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,800
I wish we could just
blow up this thing!

328
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,440
But that much firepower
would kill Misao.

329
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,400
Well, that didn't take long.

330
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,080
I try.

331
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,720
Now, what do you say
we torch this dragon

332
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,000
and pull Misao out of there?

333
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,760
Haven't we established that
that's impossible for me to do?

334
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,200
We'll see about that.

335
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,600
What's going on?

336
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,600
Blue flame?

337
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,560
She summoned the azure flame.

338
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:15,480
It's just like my father's.

339
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,360
Ayano, I knew you could do it.

340
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:20,560
I'll be right behind you.

341
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:23,920
Am I really harnessing the
power of the gods' fire?

342
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,320
Not to burst your
bubble, but it's

343
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:28,360
my power fueling the flame.

344
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:30,440
Now show me what
you can do with it.

345
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,760
So it's up to me now?

346
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,520
Then just stand back!

347
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:44,000
[SHOUTING] Now take this!

348
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,600
Impossible!

349
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,000
I collected the energy of 1,000
people, but there are only two

350
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:01,760
of them.

351
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,920
How could they do this?

352
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,160
Tell me how.

353
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:08,360
There's no way the two of
you could be this powerful!

354
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:11,840
Humans could never
have done this!

355
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,920
Your eyes‐‐ no!

356
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:16,120
You can't be the contractor!

357
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:19,400
Kazuma, how can you be the one
the spirit king of the wind

358
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,800
entrusted with the contract?

359
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,440
It doesn't make sense!

360
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,560
You‐‐ you bastard!

361
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,000
KAZUMA: Wake up, Misao.

362
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,760
Kazuma?

363
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,880
I'm taking you home.

364
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:53,680
Will you please
just let me die?

365
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,560
Why would I do that?

366
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:58,120
Because of the horrible
things I've done.

367
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:01,600
It's the only way I
can atone for my sins.

368
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,400
Don't give me that.

369
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,120
You're not getting
out of this that easy.

370
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:06,400
How many hundreds of
people did you kill?

371
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,760
Do you really think you can
wipe the slate clean and atone

372
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,160
for all of them by
giving up your own life?

373
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,600
You're just trying
to avoid the guilt,

374
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,040
and forget what you've done.

375
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:17,360
Well, I'm not going to let you
run away from this by dying.

376
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,240
But‐‐ what else am
I supposed to do?

377
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,640
Is it even possible to make
amends after committing

378
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,400
such an unforgivable sin?

379
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,200
I don't know.

380
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,760
But I do know how
you can get started.

381
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,320
First you need to
forget about the dead,

382
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,280
and straighten out
your priorities.

383
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,440
You caused me the most
trouble, so I'm number

384
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,040
one on your payback list.

385
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,800
That means you've got to find
some way to make it up to me.

386
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,680
Guess you're right.

387
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,240
I've got a life of
atonement ahead of me,

388
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,400
and I won't be able
to do it if I'm dead.

389
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,360
And with everything I've done
to you, you should be first.

390
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,000
Damn straight.

391
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,560
Whatever you want, then.

392
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,480
All right.

393
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,520
Then why don't we‐‐

394
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,080
Get away from her, now!

395
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,160
I think you should
calm down, Ayano.

396
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,080
Then I can't wait to hear
what you're gonna think after I

397
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,760
turn this jerk into barbecue!

398
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:13,560
Wait!

399
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,400
Can't we talk about this first?

400
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,320
Hello, Kazuma.

401
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,520
Hey.

402
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,520
Hi, Misao.

403
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,800
It's good to see you.

404
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,160
KAZUMA: So you just decided
to run off to a nunnery

405
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,000
without even saying goodbye?

406
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,840
Actually, this is what
Master Jugo decided for me.

407
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,400
Jugo?

408
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,480
Typical.

409
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,400
I realize that praying
isn't going to take

410
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,880
back everything I've done.

411
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,280
It helps, but it's not enough.

412
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,520
So I guess to have my
entire life to figure out

413
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,880
how I can make up for it all.

414
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,840
I see.

415
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:03,000
Um‐‐ can I ask you something?

416
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,880
After all the terrible
things I did to you,

417
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,040
why did you save me?

418
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,360
It would have been
so much easier

419
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,600
for you to destroy the dragon
with me inside of it, so‐‐

420
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:13,120
why?

421
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,600
I have a good memory.

422
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,360
Not every Kannagi can
control their fire.

423
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,480
One kid in particular
was terrified of it.

424
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,840
Hey, what's the matter, Kazuma?

425
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,240
You can't stand the fire?

426
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,040
Pathetic.

427
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,040
Just look at the crybaby.

428
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,080
He's worthless.

429
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,600
He calls himself a Kannagi?

430
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,760
Hey, give him a break.

431
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,520
He just needs to lighten up.

432
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,000
[LAUGHTER]

433
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,480
Leave him alone!

434
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,440
It doesn't matter if he
can't control his fire.

435
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,160
He's still a member
of our family,

436
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,840
so quit being mean to him!

437
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:49,240
MISAO: Wait‐‐ so
you're telling me‐‐

438
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:54,200
you saved me because I helped
you when we were children?

439
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,320
Yeah.

440
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,280
Guess it's something like that.

441
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,120
What?

442
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:58,880
Is he serious?

443
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,120
Bye, Misao.

444
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,480
I'll drop in alone some time.

445
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,400
Since you still
haven't repaid me.

447

00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:14,240
Tell me you're not actually
still harassing her?

450
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,040
Hey!

451
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:15,920
I asked you a question.

452
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,120
Don't walk away!

453
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,280
Well, are you gonna answer me?

454
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,000
You do realize she's a nun now?
