332
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,240
What do you think you're doing,
using your magic in public?

333
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,920
And you're trying to use
it against innocent people?

334
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,720
How can you even call
yourself a magic user?

335
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,520
KIYOSHI: What?

336
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:48,480
Whoever said I did?

337
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,920
And I would've hit
you harder if I'd

338
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,120
known you were a player too.

339
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:55,200
But now that I do know,
I'll pad my experience

340
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,160
points by kicking your ass.

341
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,600
Phoenix Wing!

342
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,800
Heh.

343
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,320
You gotta be kidding.

344
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,000
You really think
that could stop me?

345
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,720
Hate to burst your
bubble, but you're dealing

346
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,000
with a fire master here, kid.

347
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,240
REN (VOICEOVER): A yoma's
gotten a hold of him.

348
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,240
The guy doesn't even
realize he's been possessed.

349
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:30,840
He's just thinks he's
some kind of super hero.

350
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,160
Kiyoshi.

351
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,720
I didn't think anyone could
deflect your Phoenix Wing.

352
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,800
You're right.

353
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:39,360
He'd have to be ranked as high
as I am to block that move.

354
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,360
I guess that means
Vesalius was lying

355
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,000
to me when he said
I was the highest

356
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
ranking flame enabled player.

357
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,840
I'll just have to
defend my title.

358
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,000
REN (VOICEOVER): Vesalius?

359
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,400
He must be the one who
cursed him with the yoma.

360
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,080
There's only room in this
city for one fire master,

361
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,560
and that's me!

362
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,480
Flame Vortex!

363
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,880
Try my purifying flame.

364
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,640
Heh.

365
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:25,000
Almost had me there.

366
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,880
But now, you're dead meat!

367
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:28,760
Flame Vortex!

368
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,160
Am I out of points?

369
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:33,920
All right.

370
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:37,160
Fire Bird!

371
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,440
Uh.

372
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,240
Come on.

373
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,640
Please work.

374
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,240
REN: It won't.

375
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,600
Your magic's gone.

376
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,520
I erased it when I destroyed
the evil spirit possessing you.

377
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,360
Just accept it, all right?

378
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,000
The game is over.

379
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:51,920
Welcome back to reality.

380
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,480
Hey, wait.

381
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,760
Come back.

382
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:03,240
Please don't leave me here.

383
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,120
[WHIMPERING]

384
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,440
Please don't kill me.

385
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,800
TATSUYA: Uh, Ren.

386
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,640
Ren.

387
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,160
You‐‐

388
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,720
How did you‐‐

389
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,880
what was that?

390
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,640
Oh yeah.

391
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,440
That was‐‐

392
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,440
So awesome!

393
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,080
Oh, Ren!

394
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,360
That was so cool.

395
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,440
You're amazing, man.

396
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,680
I've always had a
feeling there was

397
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,200
something special about you.

398
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:33,080
That has to be the coolest
thing I've ever seen.

399
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:35,280
You sure know how to
make a girl fall for you.

400
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,160
Heh.

401
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:36,920
All right.

402
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:37,800
All right, you guys.

403
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,000
Try not to get too excited, OK?

404
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,360
Let's have a talk.

405
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,880
And why don't you
start by telling

406
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,120
me where you got your powers?

407
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,080
So what's Pandemonium?

408
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,280
All I know is
that it's a website.

409
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,400
I found it one night when
I was up surfing the net.

410
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,640
There was hardly
anything on the page.

411
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,040
Just a question.

412
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,640
As soon as I clicked it,
the screen turned white,

413
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,440
and I guess I blacked out.

414
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,120
And when I woke
up, somehow I just

415
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,360
knew I'd been given powers.

416
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,920
The only logical
explanation is

417
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:18,040
that the website must emulate
the yoma summoning ritual.

418
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,560
By clicking Yes,
you're signing over

419
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:24,320
the contract for your soul,
and without even realizing it.

420
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,520
REN: So after you've
signed the contract,

421
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:29,160
the yoma must somehow download
directly into your body

422
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,800
from the internet.

423
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,000
KANON: So how'd you
even find the website?

424
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,560
Off a search engine
or something?

425
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,360
You can't, all right?

426
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,520
I got disconnected while I was
passed out, and when I woke up,

427
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,640
I couldn't remember
how to find it.

428
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,160
No matter how much
I've searched,

429
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,000
never come across it again.

430
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,760
As far as I know, nobody
can get to Pandemonium twice.

431
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,040
At least that's what
everyone's saying.

432
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,280
CATHERINE: Everyone?

433
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,560
There's an online
message board

434
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:57,560
where players post their
stats or challenge each other.

435
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:00,120
It's mostly just people
bragging about their powers,

436
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,360
but it's where you make
your battle appointments.

437
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,240
Appointments?

438
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,560
Explain.

439
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,160
You gain experience points
from battling other players,

440
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,400
and if you get
enough, you can move

441
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,080
up to a higher skill level.

442
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,680
Once you move up,
Pandemonium sends

443
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,800
you an email to let you know.

444
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,320
But from the rumors
I've heard, things

445
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,000
get really interesting when
you reach the highest level.

446
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,840
When that happens, you
get a personal invitation

447
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:23,840
to physically go to Pandemonium.

448
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,040
And you're saying that
you've actually been there?

449
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:29,080
Not to the website, but
to Pandemonium itself?

450
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:29,840
KIYOSHI: Yeah.

451
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,240
The email didn't even
give specific directions.

452
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,160
Just said to go for a walk.

453
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,000
And the next thing I knew, I was
standing in front of a mansion

454
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,640
with a sign that said
Pandemonium on it.

455
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,640
TATSUYA: What the hell?

456
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,520
KANON: Are you sure you
didn't just dream this?

457
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,200
It happened, all right?

458
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,480
That's how I got the power
to become a fire master

459
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,240
from this guy named Vesalius.

460
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:51,280
He actually gave
it to me in person.

461
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,240
VESALIUS: Welcome
to Pandemonium.

462
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:56,480
You've been chosen
for your strength.

463
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,680
Your power has
developed impressively,

464
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:02,200
and I believe you're ready
to advance to the next level.

465
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,920
Do you wish to become a master?

466
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:08,160
I remember looking out
on the entire city, almost

467
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,840
like we were
hovering in the air.

468
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,400
TATSUYA: Like you
were on a helicopter

469
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,360
or a plane or something?

470
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,200
Uh‐uh.

471
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,320
Because we weren't
moving at all.

472
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,520
And there were‐‐

473
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,640
I‐‐ I think I remember
that there were

474
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:22,280
two towers next to the mansion.

475
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,920
What kind of towers?

476
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:24,720
I don't know.

477
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,520
I can't really remember
what they looked like.

478
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,840
I just know the mansion
was in between them.

479
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,720
Were they attached
to the mansion?

480
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,280
Like it was all part
of the same building?

481
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,680
AYANO: Detective Tachibana.

482
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,760
KIRIKA: Oh, Ayano.

483
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,160
Were you waiting
out here for me?

484
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,600
I wanna know what's
going on with Kazuma.

485
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,600
We'll talk about it inside.

486
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,040
Hm?

487
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,240
There's nothing there.

488
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,720
KANON: Don't be stupid.

489
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,400
They're obviously gonna hide
it with some kind of magic.

490
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,040
If they didn't, then
all of the players

491
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,280
would storm the mansion
demanding more power.

492
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,720
It'd be like a
magical nerd riot.

493
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:22,520
TATSUYA: Oh, yeah.

494
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,120
I guess you're right.

495
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,520
So what do we do, Ren?

496
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,200
I really wish
Kazuma were here.

497
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,840
He can find anything,
no matter how much

498
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,840
magic they use to cloak it.

499
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:33,480
KANON: So your brother
has powers too?

500
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,400
I guess that makes sense.

501
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,800
TATSUYA: Well, maybe we
should come back with him.

502
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,000
Good idea.

503
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,560
I'm starving anyway.

504
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:44,160
Let's get something to eat
and worry about this later.

505
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,440
OK, Ren?

506
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,760
I'm not sure if
this will work,

507
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:51,240
but if they're hiding the
mansion behind a veil of magic,

508
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,160
then I should be
able to burn it away.

509
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,600
KANON: Whoa!

510
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,600
Did you see that?

511
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,200
All right.

512
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,080
Something tells me we need
to get out of here now.

513
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,280
VESALIUS (VOICEOVER): Not
the most polite way to knock,

514
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:13,560
but you did get my attention.

515
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,360
Ren?

516
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,760
TATSUYA: What the?

517
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,760
We only turned our
backs for a second.

518
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,240
Where did he go?

519
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,160
KANON: He was right there!

520
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,160
Ren!

521
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,640
How could he
disappear like that?

522
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,440
TATSUYA: What?

523
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,160
I‐‐ I have no idea.

524
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:26,920
Ren.

525
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,040
Where are you?

526
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:28,800
Ren!

527
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,480
[THEME MUSIC]

528
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,160
AYANO (VOICEOVER):
I can't believe

529
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,440
someone would infect the
public by distributing

530
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,880
yoma on the internet.

531
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,040
Who would do
something like that?

532
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:11,800
Don't worry.

533
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:14,200
I swear on my life,
I'll rescue Ren.

534
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:18,480
And Kazuma won't let anything
happen to him either.

535
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:22,040
So this is the Pandemonium that
everyone won't shut up about.

536
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,080
And you must be Vesalius.

537
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:27,400
Next time on "Kaze no
Stigma," Pandemonium.

538
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:30,520
Stop messing around
and get to it.
