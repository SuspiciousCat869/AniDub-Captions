over the internet.

Yoma downloaded
directly into humans.

Then, their souls were tested
in battle to find the strongest.

00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,560
And those souls were then
harvested as the building

blocks for Pandemonium.

How can you let
yourself do this?

that knows this is wrong.

It's the only way
I can develop a soul.

110
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:48,120
I'm nothing but
a doll, a replica

made from the residue

112

of her last emotion.

113
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,400
Master Bernhardt
taught me that despair

114
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,480
is the most complex and
beautiful human experience.

115
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,000
He said that if I
can find pleasure

116
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,080
in the intricacies
of another's pain,

117
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,280
I would then be able
to cultivate my own.

118
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,600
So if I can develop
my own emotions,

119
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,720
different from the ones
I was created with,

120
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,840
then those feelings will become
the foundation of a soul.

121
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:15,280
And all you have to do is
torture other people to get it?

That's just pathetic.

00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:18,160
I'm sure I'll enjoy the
look of agony on your face.

166
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,880
What now?

167
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:22,680
We fly.

168
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,280
It's a summoning circle.

169
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,680
And it's huge.

170
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,360
This is hopeless.

171
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:49,440
My contractor powers are nothing
against a demon this strong.

172
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,200
And your divine flame won't
even put a scratch on it.

173
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,600
Then, what do we do?

174
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,360
The only chance we've got
is to attack it together.

175
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,160
We might as well
die trying, right?

176
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,920
Put all your power
into a single shot.

177
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,120
Then, let it all
out in one blast.

178
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,680
You with me, Ren?
‐ Yeah.

179
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,520
Ayano?

180
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,320
Yeah.

181
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,800
So I guess this could
be the last time

182
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,520
I ever see your face, huh?

183
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,320
Hm?

184
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:26,200
You got anything you want to
tell me, before we, you know,

185
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,040
die?

186
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,880
How about you cook
me a meal after this?

187
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,000
And I'll tell you then?

188
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,680
I'd rather die.

189
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,800
Suit yourself.

190
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,080
Get ready.

191
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,120
Hear me, spirits of the wind.

192
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:02,840
In the name of the contract,
entrust me with you power.

193
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,800
Tsui‐Ling.

194
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,720
Kazuma.

195
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:13,680
In the name of stars and
wisdom, let my words be heard.

196
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,040
I pursue only the truth.

197
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,600
Erwin, just let her go.

198
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,880
Please, let Tsui‐Ling go.

199
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:37,000
Was I really put on this Earth
just to be eaten by a demon?

200
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,400
Is this really how my
life is supposed to end?

201
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,320
Kazuma.

202
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,240
No, Tsui‐Ling.

203
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,680
Don't leave me.

204
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,320
I could have saved her.

205
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,320
I could have stopped them
if I'd had my powers then.

206
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,520
But I didn't.

207
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:15,640
And there's nothing I
can do about that now.

208
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:18,360
I can't change the past.

209
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:23,000
But I know I can
protect the future.

210
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,400
We can do this.

211
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,400
Enraiha, come forth.

212
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,360
Here it comes.

213
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,320
Just a few more seconds.

214
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,280
Now, fight with
everything you've got.

215
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:19,440
It is extraordinary
how genuinely fearsome

216
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,320
the Kannagi bloodline is.

217
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,120
You were able to prevent
for summoning of Belial.

218
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,040
That should be
humanly impossible.

219
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,840
I figured a coward like
you would've hauled ass

220
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,200
out of the country by now.

221
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,200
Did you really
think I would pass

222
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,560
up the opportunity to
witness Belial lay waste

223
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,560
to an entire city?

224
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,880
Yeah, well, sorry
to disappoint you.

225
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,320
KAZUMA (VOICEOVER): This is bad.

226
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,160
None of us has the
energy to take him on.

227
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,160
You have nothing
to worry about.

228
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:48,320
I have no desire to try
and fight you right now.

229
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,800
And I've never been one
to bet against the odds.

230
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,000
I'd prefer a fight
that I know I'll win.

231
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,400
And this doesn't look
to be in my favor.

232
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:01,080
KAZUMA: What's the
old man doing here?

233
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:03,880
I can feel that he's just
as powerful as you are,

234
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,040
contractor.

235
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,480
It is remarkable.

236
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,600
The Kannagi family
truly is a great force

237
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,640
to be reckoned with.

238
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,240
Well, sorry to cut this short.

239
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,600
But I really must
be leaving now.

240
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,920
Although, you shouldn't worry.

241
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:21,160
I do have the feeling we'll see
each other again sometime soon,

242
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,040
Kazuma Yugami.

243
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,080
Wait.

244
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:26,720
Just tell me what the last
emotion was that Tsui‐Ling

245
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,320
felt before she died.

246
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,520
Please, I need to know.

247
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,880
What did she want to tell me?

248
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,920
It's all right.

249
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,720
Go ahead.

250
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:43,840
Very well, master.

251
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,320
Her last thought was that
she wished you were dead.

252
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,160
I think we should
go now, Lapis.

253
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:02,040
Well, then, have a nice day.

254
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,360
Kazuma.

255
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:35,800
I'm sorry.

256
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,720
You know she was lying, right?

257
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,760
She only said that to try
and mess with your head.

258
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,840
There's no way Tsui‐Ling
wanted to kill you.

259
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:05,560
I just can't believe that
was her last thought.

260
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:08,880
Well, it could have been.

261
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,920
I lied to her, you know?

262
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,560
I told her that I'd
always protect her.

263
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:18,320
Then, I couldn't
even save her life.

264
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,400
She probably
resented me for that.

265
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,480
But it's not your
fault. You hadn't even

266
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,720
awakened to your powers yet.

267
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,560
So you couldn't do
anything to stop them.

268
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,840
I guess you're right.

269
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:34,440
Strange thing is, I
awakened to my power right

270
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:38,520
after she died, when
they tried to kill me.

271
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:41,600
It's common for that to
happen when you're in danger.

272
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,400
That's not strange.

273
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,680
But nothing happened
when she was in danger.

274
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:51,040
Why didn't I wake up then?

275
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,880
Maybe I should let her do it.

276
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,400
Maybe that's what I deserve.

277
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,560
I don't know what
you're saying, Kazuma.

278
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,000
And I hope I'm wrong.

279
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,840
But it sounds like you almost
want Lapis to kill you.

280
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,320
And what would that solve?

281
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,080
What is wrong with you, Kazuma?

282
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,560
What's it going to take to
make you realize that it's over

283
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,520
and you're here now?

284
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,360
Come on.

285
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:11,280
Will you calm down?

286
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,240
I've already realized that.

287
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,040
I have to live with my past.

288
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,440
But it won't control me.

289
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:19,200
Now, is the only
thing that matters.

290
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,440
And that's what I'm
going to protect.

291
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,360
And I swear, I'll
protect all of you.

292
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,360
What'd you do that for?

293
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,520
Jerk.

294
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,880
Did I ever ask
you to protect me?

295
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,200
Whatever happened to you in the
past is none of my business.

296
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,520
And I realize that, OK?

297
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,000
But I can tell that
you're in pain.

298
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,680
So you don't have to
try and hide it from me.

299
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,840
I mean, I'm strong enough
to be here for you.

300
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,360
You don't always have
to deal with everything

301
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,480
all by yourself.

302
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:46,520
Am I so unreliable that
you can't even trust me?

303
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,160
What do you think of me anyway?

304
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,720
Am I just a burden to you?

305
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,600
A helpless little girl?

306
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,760
Do you just want me to hide
somewhere while you swoop in

307
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,400
and save the day
then, gratefully

308
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,240
kiss you on the cheek
once the danger's clear.

309
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,040
Listen.

310
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,520
Quit treating me like
I can't do anything,

311
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:03,120
when I know that I really can.

Well, I'm glad you've
got my back, partner.

00:21:58,920 --> 00:21:59,920
Kazuma.

00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,880
Whoa.

316
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:06,560
Ayano, that was
totally an accident.

317
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:09,520
Can't we just talk
about this peacefully?

318
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,000
Oh, boy.

00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:23,280
She'll burn down the
house one of these days.

322
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,240
Sorry about the noise.

323
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,280
She tends to get a
little carried away.

324
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,320
It's OK.

We're kind of used to it by now.

326
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,400
That's what makes her Ayano.

327
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,400
I kind of feel sorry
for Kazuma though.

328
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,240
Yeah.

329
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,120
I know what you mean.

330
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,400
I guess it's good
they get along so well.

331
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,200
Just look at him go.

332
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,000
Yeah.

333
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,600
So shouldn't we try to
stop him or something?

334
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,720
Oh, whatever, Tatsuya.

335
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,760
They'll totally be all right.

336
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,280
Do they always act like this?

337
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,040
Well, not always.

338
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,120
Just most of the time.

339
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,640
AYANO: I'm never
going to forgive you.

340
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,720
Come back here, Kazuma.

341
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,520
You're going to
get it this time.

342
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,120
