My real power is the
ability to place curses.

00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,880
I can cause an unfortunate
accident in someone's life

342
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,400
just by thinking about it.

I can murder a person
without even touching them.

You can?

345

Is that what you
did to those girls?

way you're gonna live.

A taser.

It's a remote stun
gun, and guess what?

What do you mean by that?

Utsumi isn't the
first we've dealt with.

426
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14,400
In fact, There's been a
massive outbreak of teenagers

what's going on yet,

up around the city.

Guess that makes sense.

434
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,240
So what type of
powers are involved?

435
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,240
It varies.

436

Electric, or fire, or wind.

437
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,200
Some were physically
intensified with magic.

438

A couple of them even
used the Evil Eye.

Based on their skill level, we
could handle them just fine.

440
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,480
But of course, the thing
is, they're attacking

innocent people, not
the police department,

What's with you?

like something I read

00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,600
about on the message boards.

449
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,760
It was this whole thread
about the psychic battle

to control Tokyo.

any of the details?

like they were just

talking about a video game.

454
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,880
You know, they were talking
about the typical stuff

455
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,600
like combos, defeating
each other, advancing.

They probably were just
talking about a video game.

00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,800
Yeah, that's
what I thought too.

459
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,840
That's why I stopped
paying attention to them.

460
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,080
I'll look into it.

Someone's manipulating

a minute to think about this?

That's fine, I guess.

Awesome.

working with us as well,

I'm sure it's a
burden for Kazuma,

00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:31,560
but I figure maybe the rookie
will learn a thing or two.

Wow.

Your jealousy is out

Yeah, whatever.

So detective.

Do you really think it's
a good idea to team Kazuma

up with someone brand new?

he might last the day

Goes by Hellhound, huh?

00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,120
I'm guessing he's a fire user.

I'll take it to Pandemonium

This guy's completely
disconnected from reality.

He's talking about what he's
doing like it's a video game
