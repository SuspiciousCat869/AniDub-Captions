Tsui‐Ling left behind elements

of her thoughts and her spirit.

44

We simply picked up the pieces

in order to create Lapis.

Are you really that cold
hearted, my old friend,

lover's exact replica?

plan to stop me?

My work is already done here.

I've granted power
to countless people.

The same power I've
given to Lapis.

67
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:15,600
And she is an
unparalleled swordmaster.

Why don't you show our guests
exactly what you're capable of?

Bernhardt!

82
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,800
UTSUMI: I don't understand.

83
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,840
Why did it turn out this way?

84
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,880
I didn't ask for this.

85
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,640
They picked me.

86
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,560
I guess it's because I'm
smarter than everyone else.

87
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,680
So Why?

88
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,360
Why?

89
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:27,040
It was all Nanase's fault.
I wish she never existed.

90
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:30,720
I wonder if everyone's gonna
rise up and retaliate now.

91
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,920
I don't want that to happen.

92
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,120
I didn't do anything wrong.

93
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,200
I'm completely innocent.

94
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,400
This whole thing
is Vesalius' fault.

95
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,480
He gave me the power without
me knowing the consequences.

96
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:46,040
So if I'm innocent,
why am I in jail?

97
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,880
He's the one they
should arrest, not me.

98
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,200
Ah!

KIRIKA: We're releasing
a doctored version

100
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:34,040
of this footage to the public to
try and keep things contained.

101
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,600
The official stance
of the department

102
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,920
is that this incident
was an explosion.

103
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,440
At any rate, what you
did was quite reckless.

104
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:43,760
Frankly, I'm surprised all
three of you managed to escape.

105
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,680
Kazuma got us out
of there just in time.

106
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,480
Yeah.

107
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,280
If it wasn't for him, we would
have really been in trouble.

108
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,760
So, I assume no one's
heard from my idiot son yet.

109
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,200
We can't find him.

110
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,080
He disappeared right
after he rescued us,

111
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,160
and we haven't heard
from him since then.

112
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,680
What a worthless punk.

113
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,000
To disappear right in
the middle of a crisis.

114
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,080
That's not true.

115
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,160
Easy now, Ren.

116
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,920
Ayano.

117
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,640
You must prepare
for the possibility

118
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,040
of facing this enemy again.

119
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,640
Understand?

120
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,920
Of course I do.

121
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,920
I'll be ready.

122
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,120
Sure, but Pandemonium
has already been destroyed,

123
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:18,880
hasn't it?

124
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:21,320
Maybe the enemy won't
make a move any time soon.

125
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,240
KIRIKA: They already have.

126
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,520
Huh?

127
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,000
Take a look at this film.

128
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,400
It was taken last night after
Pandemonium was destroyed.

129
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,520
AYANO: Is that blood?

130
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,360
REN: Congratulations.

131
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,080
You have just advanced
to the next level.

132
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,280
Now you will acquire even more
power by changing your class.

133
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,600
Wait, isn't this?

134
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,600
That's right.

135
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,400
See?

136
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,360
Look at the bottom.

137
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,040
We welcome you to Pandemonium.

138
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,440
Do you wish to‐‐

139
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,640
Don't tell me this means‐‐

140
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,520
Yes.

141
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,520
They've already surfaced.

142
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:50,680
There's a brand new Pandemonium.

143
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,200
So So that means
this bloody message

144
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,000
was sent from the new location.

145
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,880
But I don't get it.

146
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,920
What's with the hand print?

147
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,840
They got to pick Yes or No.

148
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:02,200
That hand print is
the choice he made.

149
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,920
Who is he?

150
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,440
I'm sorry, but it's Utsumi.

151
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,600
I don't understand.

152
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,720
I thought Utsumi was locked up.

153
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:13,160
Our people found the bloody
message in his isolation cell.

154
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,920
We think he escaped sometime
in the middle of the night.

155
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,240
We're not exactly sure
how he managed to do it,

156
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,920
but when they checked his cell
this morning, he was gone.

157
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,320
Do you realize how bad
you guys have screwed up?

158
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,760
And if he's out
there on the loose,

159
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,680
he'll go after Nanase first.

160
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,440
You have to send
someone to help her.

161
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,600
Don't worry about her.

162
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,880
It's under control.

163
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,160
Our people are on it.

164
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,800
AYANO: You'd better hope your
people know what they're doing.

165
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,520
If something happens
to her, I swear!

166
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:43,080
Now, calm down, Ayano.

167
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,720

have been delivered?

168
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,120
Can we be sure?

169
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,720
Could it be only
Utsumi's received it?

170
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,680
No way.

171
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,720
It's reached others.

172
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,560
This information hasn't
been confirmed yet,

173
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,240
but it looks like at
least four or five

174
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,480
people changed their
classes between yesterday

175
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,920
and this morning.

176
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,840
It's safe to say
the enemy's activity

177
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,680
has entered a new phase.

178
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:06,440
It seems they've intensified,
wouldn't you agree?

179
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,240
Unfortunately, yes.

180
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,040
Do we have any idea
who's responsible?

181
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,400
The leader goes by
the name Vesalius.

182
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,920
However, based on what we
know, it's not his real name.

183
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,800
We saw him when we
were inside Pandemonium.

184
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,560
From what I can remember, Kazuma
called him something else.

185
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,440
That's right.

186
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,840
Kazuma was talking
to the guy like they

187
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,480
knew each other pretty well.

188
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,000
And like they had some
sort of history together.

189
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,600
I remember his
name was Bernhardt.

190
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,600
What did you say?

191
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,400
Is that true?

192
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,720
You're sure.

193
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,320
REN: I'm positive.

194
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:36,040
Then it's gotta
be Bernhardt Rhodes.

195
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,480
He's currently the council
chairman of Almagest.

196
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,280
Almagest?

197
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,320
You mean the order
of magical arts?

198
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:44,600
There's far more to
it than that, Ayano.

199
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,200
They've mainly been
active in Europe,

200
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,800
but worldwide, they're regarded
as the ultimate authority

201
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,360
on modern magic arts.

202
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,640
Their techniques
are unparalleled.

203
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,840
Do you think someone in
the position of authority

204
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:58,040
he's in would risk being
involved in this kind of thing?

205
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,080
I don't know.

206
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,720
I suppose someone could
be posing as Bernhardt.

207
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,560
I doubt it.

208
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,680
I'm certain it was him.

209
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,760
Really?

210
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,560
And what makes you so sure?

211
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,200
Almagest has held a grudge
against Kazuma for a long time

212
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,080
now.

213
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,480
And there's the girl, Tsui‐Ling,
who's the basis of Lapis.

214
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,840
She's definitely a major
factor in this whole thing.

215
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,720

and you didn't tell us?

might like to know that?

I agree that it's
important to keep secrets,

229
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,000
but in this particular instance,
if this girl affects this case

230
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,200
in any way at all,
then we need to know

Have I ever told you
about my family back home?

Mm‐mm.

342
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,920
It's our tradition to make
one of the youngest members

343
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,600
with power the successor
of the family line,

344
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:24,000
but for whatever reason I
wasn't blessed with any power.

I was kicked out, so I came
here to get away from all that.

I tried to forget about
them and everything

No matter how much I tried, I
couldn't get it out of my head.

More than anything else in
the world, I wanted power.

probably never will.

You do, don't you?

you'll get to go home.
