That is the symbol

stigma of the wind.

You have no idea who
you're messing with, Kazuma!

Actually, I do.

Ugh, it's so unfair!

It really makes me mad!

16

I was just trying
to help the family,

No, I got yelled at!

So I snuck out and
tried to beat up the guy

without father's permission.

me for a month.

what she's talking about.

The only thing
I could figure out

00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,200
is her father grounded
her again for some reason?

That's the fourth time she's
been grounded this month,

So you feel the
same way I do, Genma?

If it was Kazuma, why would he
trap Ayano with a wind barrier,

then murder Shingo and
Takeya in front of her?

It just doesn't make any sense.

That's like announcing

Too bad the rest of the family

It is easier to believe that

they call for our children
to learn our way of life.

And he had difficulty
mastering it.

Is that why you
decided to shun him,

tell him that I wish him well.

to take me in by force?

If it's a fight you
want, I'm ready.

163
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,880
You're a weakling.

164
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,280
KAZUMA: You don't know
a damn thing about me,

165
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,360
but I'll let you in
on a little fact.

166
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,920
I refuse to take orders from you
or anyone else in the family,

167
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:16,720
ever again.

168
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,880
I'm not surprised.

169
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,440
I had a feeling it
would come to this.

170
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,040
Yeah?

171
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,040
How's this for a surprise?

172
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,720
Don't tell me
that's all you've got.

173
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,200
No way, not even close.

174
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,120
Damn.

175
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,200
It has no effect.

176
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,400
Look, I don't care what you
think about the family or me,

177
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,720
but I don't have time for you
and your little parlor tricks,

178
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,080
so let's end this right now.

179
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,800
GENMA: So, you're using a
wind barrier to repel things.

180
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:12,000
He burns only his
target and nothing else.

181
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,880
No wonder he's the family's
strongest fire magic user.

182
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,200
I'm actually impressed.

183
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,400
I see now that I
shouldn't have held back.

184
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:22,360
That's a mistake I plan
to rectify, this time.

185
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,360
[YELLING]

186
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,520
I'm scared now.

187
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,240
But I have to let you live.

188
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,440
I'm gonna need some
answers before killing you.

189
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,040
I don't think so.

190
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Impressed?

191
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,200
GENMA: It'll take a
lot more than that.

192
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,240
You controlled the
oxygen within the wind,

193
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,520
creating excessive combustion‐‐

194
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,200
a trick you used on
Shingo and Takeya.

195
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,120
You're pretty smart, old man.

196
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,160
And you're pretty dumb if
you thought the same thing

197
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,520
would work on me.

198
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,240
Is this one of the
skills I supposedly

199
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,640
don't know about you?

200
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:00,560
Is that all you've accomplished
in the last four years?

201
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,000
You disappoint me.

202
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,040
Oh, really?

203
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,480
Hey, why don't you try
telling me something

204
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,120
I don't know, old man?

205
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,880
Disowning me made
it pretty clear.

206
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,920
GENMA: I'm going to
say this one last time.

207
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,280
Surrender now.

208
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,560
I'd rather die
than give in to you!

209
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:16,240
I'm not going anywhere.

210
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,480
Very well.

211
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,560
If you won't come
along willingly,

212
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:22,160
I have no other choice but
to use an alternate form

213
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,000
of persuasion.

214
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:23,760
Oh, yeah?

215
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,520
That's the God's Fire.

216
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,480
KAZUMA: The azure flames.

217
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,120
God's Fire.

218
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,320
The ultimate power.

219
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,720
So strong that only the
greatest masters of fire magic

220
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,120
can summon it.

221
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,840
Over the 1,000 years of
the Kannagi family history,

222
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,480
only 11 members have had
the skill to master it.

223
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:06,360
I guess that's the
legendary God's Fire, huh?

224
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,080
Bravo.

225
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,000
I've never seen it.

226
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,760
You never bothered
to show it to me.

227
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,520
Well take a good look.

228
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:16,000
This is true power, and
those little tricks of yours

229
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,880
are totally useless against it.

230
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,120
You're right.

231
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,800
Those tricks won't work
against the God's Fire.

232
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:27,520
So I guess I'm gonna have to
use something a little stronger.

233
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:30,360
You showed me your
true power, old man.

234
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,000
And now I'm going
to show you mine.

235
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,240
Wait, are those
spirits of the wind?

236
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,480
And there are so many of them.

237
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,760
My God, but how?

238
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,760
It's not possible!

239
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,000
Nice try, but wind magic
can summon spirits faster.

240
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I see.

241
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
He did it.

242
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
He found his own way.

243
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:21,920
[LAUGHING]

244
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,160
I did it!

245
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,480
I beat him!

246
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,720
How about that, old man?

247
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,840
This so‐called weakling
just kicked your ass!

248
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,120
[LAUGHING]

249
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,360
What should I do, Tsui‐Ling?

250
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,040
Please, tell me.

251
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,080
What am I supposed to do?

252
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,840
A fire magic user's here.

253
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,640
Another Kannagi?

254
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,840
Come on out!

255
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,240
REN: I never thought
anyone could do it,

256
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,560
but if you're here that
can only mean one thing.

257

You defeated him.

258
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,080
What are you talking about?

259
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,120
Who are you?

00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,400
Come on!

Don't tell me you've
forgotten what

your own brother looks like.

Oh, man.

265

Then I guess that means
you're Ren, aren't you?

00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,760
That's me.

You sure have gotten big.

What's it been, like
a million years now?

It's only been four, Kazuma.

270
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,200
Sure feels a heck of a
lot longer than that to me.

271
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,640
Do you remember when
I left home back then?

272
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,160
Yes, how could I forget it?

273
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:38,040
You didn't even bother
to say goodbye to me.

I'm sorry about that.

could find me at this hotel?

276

Hyoe Kazamaki told me this
is where you were staying.

00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,040
So, what are you up to?

00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,600
Why'd you come here?

280
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:53,600
To talk to the brother
I haven't seen in years.

281
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,480
Hmm.

282

Right.

00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,560
Where are you going?

284
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,240
Upstairs to my room.

It's been a crazy
day and I'm beat.

Well, you coming?

00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,720
Of course!

288
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,520
Cool.

289
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:09,120
Oh, by the way, don't
worry about your old man.

290
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,840
I made sure he
got to a hospital.

291
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,120
You took him yourself?

292
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,600
No, that would've been too
much of a pain in the ass.

293
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,560
I just called 911 and told
them where to find him.

294
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,360
REN: What?

295
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,320
How could you?

296
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,280
He's your father!

297
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,560
Weird.

298
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,800
Who's texting me this late?

299
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,000
It's from Ren.

300
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,760
"I'm going to the Royal Bay
Hotel to see my brother.

301
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:35,240
Please don't worry."

302
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,560
I've got you now, Kazuma.

303
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,600
It's true.

304
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,800
You're him, aren't you?

305
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,240
The contractor.

306
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,440
You can tell me.

307
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,040
The Contractor?

308
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,440
What makes you say that?

309
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,800
Well, it's the
only explanation

310
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,240
for what happened tonight.

311
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,880
A Contractor makes a pact with
one of the great spirit kings,

312
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,280
and they're given powers.

313
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:00,720
All the powers of
that king's domain.

314
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,280
You know this, right?

315
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,840
Yeah, of course I do.

316
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:06,320
And that's why the Kannagis
can use fire magic today.

317
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,360
The first head of the
family was made a Contractor

318
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,920
by the spirit king of fire.

319
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,120
It's ancient family history now.

320
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,400
Maybe it's not so ancient.

321
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:16,000
There have been rumors floating
around the internet recently.

322
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,480
Some occult websites
are claiming

323
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,600
that there's a new Contractor
in the world today.

324

Well, I need to
ask you something.

Are you the wind
magic user who's been

killing members of our family?

No.

342
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,480
I've told that to every
Kannagi I've run across.

343
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,160
But none of them seem to believe
me, even though I'm innocent.

344
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,400
Then why don't you do
something to clear your name?

Jugo might.

349
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,880
If I met with him,
he could probably

350

get this mess straightened out.

And give in?

353

I'm done doing what the
Kannagi family wants me to do.

354
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,920
Why?

355
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:18,520
It's not like I hate
the family or anything.

356

But still, I can't forget
what they did to me.

00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,920
And I don't think
that I ever will.

358
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,680
That's why I cast off the
family name and took a new one,

to liberate myself.

360

The old Kazuma Kannagi might've
yielded to their demands.

But Kazuma Yagami never will.

I could swallow my pride
and try to patch things

up with the family,
but it really

365
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,640
wouldn't matter in the long
run because the Kannagis
