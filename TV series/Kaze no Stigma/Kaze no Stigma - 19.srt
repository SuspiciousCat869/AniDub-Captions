Funimation.

00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:16,280
You should be watching.

00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:18,920
KAZUMA: Eyes as blue
as the azure sky.

5
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,440
That is the symbol
of the contractor,

6
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,920
entrusted by the
spirit king of the wind

7
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,240
with the powers of his domain.

8
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,480
I bear this mark, the
stigma of the wind.

[THEME MUSIC]

10
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,280
There's nothing there.

11
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,760
Don't be stupid.

12
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,480
They're obviously going to hide
it with some kind of magic.

13
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,040
If they didn't, then all the
players would storm the mansion

14
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,320
demanding more power.

15
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:21,080
It'd be like a
magical nerd riot.

16
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,400
I'm not sure if this will work.

17
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,720
But if they're hiding the
mansion behind a veil of magic,

18
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,720
then I should be
able to burn it away.

19
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,640
KANON: Whoa!

20
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,680
Did you see that?

21
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,720
All right.

22
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,640
Something tells me we need
to get out of here, now.

23
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,920
MAN: Not the most
polite way to knock,

24
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,160
but you did get my attention.

25
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:49,920
Ren?

26
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,000
What the‐‐ we only turned
our backs for a second.

27
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,920
Where did he go?

28
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,520
He was right there!

29
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,840
Ren!

30
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,160
How could he
disappear like that?

31
00:02:59,160 --> 00:02:59,920
What?

32
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,600
I have no idea.

33
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,600
Ren!

34
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,040
Where are you?

35
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:04,800
Ren!

36
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,440
Ah.

37
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,200
You're finally here, Kazuma.

38
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,800
Wait, let me take a wild guess.

39
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:34,000
You're late because you were
out screwing things up again.

40
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,360
Yeah.

41
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,160
Kazuma?

42
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,560
Now that everyone
is accounted for,

43
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,800
I'd like to go ahead and
get down to business.

44
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,680
The circumstances
surrounding this case

45
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,760
are extraordinary,
to say the least.

46
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,280
Metropolitan PD's Special
Investigation Unit

47
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,280
is not trained for
this type of incident.

48
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,560
We need your help.

49
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,840
Tell us more about
the situation.

50
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,040
Well, the target demographic
appears to be young adults.

51
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,440
Junior high to college age kids
who spend a lot of time online.

52
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,720
The kids are getting
on the internet

53
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,400
and downloading supernatural
powers from a website

54
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,680
called Pandemonium.

55
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,160
The source of the
power is a yoma.

56
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:14,000
The site uses a sophisticated
form of binary code

57
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,920
to convert the yoma
into digital data

58
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,600
that the kids can download.

59
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,120
This is horrible.

60
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,000
So they're distributing
yoma on the internet?

61
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,120
Is that how Otsumi and
the rest of those people

62
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,480
got all their abilities?

63
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,640
That's right.

64
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,400
We've made several
arrests, and managed

65
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,240
to get testimonies from
a few of the people

66
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,240
who downloaded the yoma.

67
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,840
It appears that the
majority of people

68
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,880
joined the game out
of simple curiosity,

69
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,920
not knowing what they
were really getting into.

70
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,240
Truthfully, those
kids were clueless.

71
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,280
They had no idea the
yoma would possess them

72
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,720
once they downloaded their
abilities from the Pandemonium

73
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,200
site, and they didn't know
the yoma would eat away

74
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,840
at their souls as
long as they continued

75
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,720
to use their powers, either.

76
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,880
What's the deal?

77
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,480
Do you have any idea who could
be responsible for doing this?

78
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,440
Well, that's why we came
here‐‐ to officially ask

79
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,480
for assistance from
the Kannagi family.

80
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,080
We need help.

81
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,200
I'm not surprised.

82
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:05,200
Our family always has to bail
you out when you're in trouble.

83
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,720
Ayano, please!

84
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,760
Our department is very
grateful for the help

85
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,120
you've given us in the past.

86
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,600
And I admit, we are
lacking in resources‐‐

87
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,920
but we do have a few promising
leads, and I know if we work‐‐

88
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,560
Impossible.

89
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:26,000
She's not coming back.

90
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,800
That wasn't her.

91
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,080
No matter how much
you look like her.

92
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,920
Wait‐‐ that's right.

93
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,560
Her eyes were a different color.

94
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,440
Tsui‐Ling's eyes were green.

95
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,440
What in the world
are you talking about?

96
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,800
Kazuma?

97
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,880
Were you listening to
anything we just said?

98
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,680
No.

99
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,760
Not really.

100
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,800
Well, pay attention!

101
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,200
Sorry, but something's come up.

102
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,400
I'm not going to be able
to help with this case.

103
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,720
Kazuma?

104
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,320
Now, wait just a minute!

105
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,800
What's going on with you?

106
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,280
I've got no idea who's
behind all of this,

107
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,480
but they're going to be sorry
they used an imitation of her

108
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,880
to mess with me.

109
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,920
It's time to teach
these people a lesson.

110
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,840
What are you talking about?

111
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,720
Hey, Kazuma, where
are you going?

112
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:22,400
[RINGING] Fine, just ignore me.

113
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,200
Hey, Kanon.

114
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,080
Is everything OK?

115
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:25,840
What?

116
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,480
Are you sure?

117
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,560
Wait, what do you mean by that?

118
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,800
What's up?

119
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,920
It's Ren.

120
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,640
She says he disappeared.

121
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:41,920
Kanon!

122
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,600
Tatsuya!

123
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,800
Ayano!

124
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,440
You made it.

125
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,840
You were right to call me.

126
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,680
We'll take care of
everything from here.

127
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,760
Ayano, I am so sorry.

128
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,920
If‐‐ if something happens
to Ren, I blame myself.

129
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,360
Don't be so negative, idiot!

130
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,640
He'll be fine.

131
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,680
It's OK.

132
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,640
And don't worry about it.

133
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,480
We'll rescue Ren, I promise.

134
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,000
There's our secret weapon.

135
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,880
Ren's big brother
is here to help us.

136
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,400
He is?

137
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,240
All right, you two.

138
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,400
Come with me, and I'll
take you back home.

139
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,480
You guys are lucky, you know?

140
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:15,720
Not everyone gets to
ride in the patrol car.

141
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,040
What now?

142
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,400
Looks like there's some kind
of distortion between the towers

143
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,720
of that building.

144
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,280
And?

145
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,160
I have to get closer
to find out more.

146
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,000
Great.

147
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,120
Sounds to me like
you're saying you

148
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,080
don't have any idea
what's going on.

149
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,560
No, you're missing the point.

150
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,760
He's saying someone's using
their power to stop him,

151
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,680
and block his tracking ability.

152
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,680
Otherwise he would know more.

153
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,320
Is it safe to say that
we should be concerned?

154
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:41,080
If they can inhibit your
vision, what else can they do?

155
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,120
I don't know.

156
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:45,320
And I don't know what kind
of barrier that is, either.

157
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,360
But I do know one thing‐‐

158
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,480
I'm about to rip
right through it.

159
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,720
Whatever you do, don't
destroy the building.

160
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,480
If there's any chance Ren's
inside, I'll be careful.

161
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,640
And if he's not inside?

162
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,840
I'm not making any promises.

163
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,080
Think.

164
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:04,560
There has to be a
connection here.

165
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,480
I think I see Tsui‐Ling,
then Ren gets kidnapped.

166
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,760
Someone's trying to
get my attention.

167
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,680
All right‐‐ time to
return the favor!

168
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:22,000
Wait‐‐ is that Pandemonium?

169
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,200
This is Tachibana.

170
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,920
Listen up‐‐ in
addition to evacuating

171
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,840
the people inside the
building, and the residents

172
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:41,600
in the surrounding areas,
we're going to need to control

173
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,440
the media coverage as well.

174
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,400
Right.

175
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,200
I'll keep you posted.

176
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,040
Is this a cover up operation?

177
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,840
I guess you could call it that.

178
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,240
With Kazuma on
the case, we can't

179
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,880
ignore the possibility of
that building being destroyed.

180
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,080
Yeah, you're right.

181
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,600
And considering he knows
that Ren's involved,

182
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,920
there's no way he's
going to hold back now.

183
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:04,080
If push comes to shove, you may
be the only hope I have left.

184
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,520
Think you can handle that?

185
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,880
Well, I promise to do my best.

186
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,720
Come on.

187
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,480
Let's end this thing, shall we?

188
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,240
Looks like this space has
been distorted pretty badly.

189
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,400
Now, let's find out what's
behind door number one.

190
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,400
This way!

191
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,200
All right.

192
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,680
We need to find a way outside.

193
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,640
[SHOUTING]

194
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,160
Come on!

195
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,240
This wind's so intense.

196
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,040
Be careful!

197
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
If you fell from this high
up, you'd die from shock way

198
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,720
before you hit the
ground, wouldn't you?

199
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,040
Just stay focused
on the task at hand.

200
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,080
It's over there.

201
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,200
That space is distorted.

202
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,160
After Kazuma busted
through it, the barrier

203
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,480
must have restored itself
back to its original form.

204
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,520
What do you want to do?

205
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:35,760
Looks like I might be able to
break through it with Enraiha.

206
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,040
I don't think that's wise.

207
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,800
If the barrier
disappears completely,

208
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,040
Pandemonium will be on
display to everyone,

209
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,040
and we won't be able
to contain the media.

210
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,600
Then what do you suggest?

211
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,400
Stand back.

Wow.

219
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,600
That was awesome.

220
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,120
It's you, isn't it?

221
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,040
You're Vesalius,
leader of Pandemonium.

222
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,120
The one who's
responsible for all this.

223
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,320
Oh, no.

224
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,920
My name is Lapis.

225
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:38,880
I serve Master Vesalius in
the cause of Pandemonium.

226
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,000
Well, in that case we
need to speak to your boss.

227
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,440
Would you mind taking us to him?

228
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,320
My master only meets with
people who have an appointment,

229
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,480
and you do not.

230
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,200
Please leave at once.

231
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,360
If you won't show
us the way, then

232
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,800
we'll just find him ourselves.

233
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,600
Come on, let's go.

234
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,120
If you take another step, I'll
consider your behavior hostile,

235
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,320
and we'll have to eliminate you.

236
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,120
Oh, Really?

237
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,080
Try me.

238
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,760
Turn around and go home.

239
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,560
Unwanted guests aren't
allowed to enter pandemonium,

240
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,400
and will be met with hostility.

241
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:19,440
Now, leave.

242
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,680
I can handle this one.

243
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,520
Don't worry.

244
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,120
Ayano, be careful.

245
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,560
Enraiha!

246
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,560
Come forth!

247
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,400
Are you OK?

248
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,240
Nothing happened, not even
after I burned it with Enraiha.

249
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,840
Looks like that thing is more
than just a massive sword.

250
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,840
And she's just swinging
it around effortlessly,

251
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,640
like it's nothing.

252
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,200
And we're back.

253
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,760
The distorted spaces
are connected.

254
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:31,840
They're creating a maze.

255
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:34,040
This is really getting old.

256
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,480
I could rip through
the damn thing

257
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,200
and blast this
whole place to hell,

258
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,480
but if I did that the entire
building might come down,

259
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,280
and Ren could get hurt.

260
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,760
If only I knew where he is.

261
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,280
I have to find him now.

262
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,880
Didn't anyone ever
teach you any manners?

263
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,760
Obviously not.

264
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,440
If you need more
light, just ask,

265
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,800
and I'll turn them on for you.

266
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,760
It may be a shock to you,
but we use electricity here.

267

[SNAPPING]

268
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,440
[LAUGHTER]

269
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,720
So you're Vesalius, right?

270
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,080
It's impolite not to
introduce yourself first

271
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:32,280
when you're an unwanted guest in
another man's house, young man.

272
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,320
After what you've done,
the last thing a person like

273
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,240
you deserves is politeness.

274
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:41,280
You really have some
fire in you, don't you?

275
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,520
You've entered the
house of Pandemonium.

276
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,600
Welcome, chosen one.

277
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,640
Your power has advanced
to the next level,

278
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:50,160
and the time has come for
you to make further progress.

279
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,840
Would you like to change your
class and see what comes next?

280
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:55,440
No, I would not.

281
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,040
The others eagerly nodded
their heads with excitement,

282
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,320
and were thrilled
to gain more power.

283
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,280
That's because they didn't
know that their souls had been

284
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,480
possessed by yoma, and
that using their powers

285
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,720
was like poisoning
their own spirits!

286
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,200
An unfortunate truth.

287
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:11,520
But from my perspective, for
the sake of the experiment

288
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,240
it's a cost well worth it.

289
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,560
Experiment?

290
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,320
Oh, yes.

291
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,320
Indeed, my boy.

292
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,080
What kind of
power is she using?

293
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,520
OK, that's it.

294
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,000
This ends now!

295
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,880
It absorbed the flame!

296
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,760
An attack like this
won't work on me.

297
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:51,720
What's the matter?

298
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,120
Having some problems?

299
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:53,880
Are you losing?

300
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,080
It looks to me
like you're losing.

301
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,480
Can you at least
pretend you're helping,

302
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,680
instead of standing there
watching me get my butt kicked?

303
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,840
Come on, don't be ridiculous.

304
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,440
What help could I
possibly be in the middle

305
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,320
of a swordfight like this?

00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:07,000
If Kazuma were
here, I know he'd‐‐

307
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,480
Now look, I really
don't think it's

308
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,240
fair to put a human
on the same level

309
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,600
as someone with Kazuma's skill.

310
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,600
AYANO (VOICEOVER): Come on.

311
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,080
Hurry up, Kazuma!

312
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,440
Find Ren, and get back here.

313
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,840
This experiment‐‐
what's it about?

314
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,360
Why are you making yoma
possess random people?

315
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:35,080
What exactly are
you trying to do?

316
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:40,160
Why should you be so concerned
with the affairs of others?

317
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,080
Ayano?

318
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,440
Kazuma?

319
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:46,640
Both of them have come here
to rescue you, young man.

320
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,720
It would seem they
love you dearly.

321
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,480
The person fighting
against, and soon

322
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:55,560
to be defeating Ayano Kannagi
is my personal servant, Lapis.

323
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:59,240
I've trained her well in the
art of battling magic users.

324
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,640
Not even a fire magic
user of the Kannagi line

325
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,480
can stand up to her.

326
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,520
As far as your brother
Kazuma is concerned,

327
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,120
he's desperately
lost in the middle

328
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,600
of an unsurpassable maze.

329
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,760
One that I have created entirely
out of distorted spaces.

330
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,840
Kazuma's wind magic can
blow that maze to pieces.

331
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,880
He can if he wants to
bring down the building,

332
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,320
and kill you in the process.

333
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:22,320
After all, Ren, you're a captive
here, and Kazuma knows it.

334
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,720
He wouldn't dare put the golden
child of the Kannagis at risk.

335
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,760
Don't you realize that
in the eyes of our enemy,

336
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,440
you are everything?

337
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,000
Wait, what do you
mean he's your enemy?

338
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,760
Are you saying
Kazuma's your target?

339
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,520
You did all this just
to bring him down?

340
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,360
No.

341
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,240
He's just the icing on the cake.

342
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,160
I knew that your big
brother was in town,

343
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,760
but to tell you the truth,
I'm a very busy man,

344
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:45,160
and I simply don't have the
time to devote my resources

345
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,280
to dealing with him.

346
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,440
I don't get it.

347
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,440
If that's not Kazuma, then who?

348
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,680
What reason could you
possibly have for doing this?

349
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,000
I don't know.

350
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,760
For the drama?

351
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:57,360
When will the climax of
our little play take place?

352
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,040
When will all three
of you come together

353
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:03,440
and meet up for the last time,
in your final scene together?

354
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,440
The main characters miraculously
discover the secret hideout

355
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:10,120
of the sinister magic user, but
then suddenly fall into a trap

356
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,600
and get separated,
and each of them

357
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,600
encounters a formidable enemy.

358
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,400
What do you think?

359
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,680
Quite an exhilarating
story, isn't it?

360
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,760
And obviously an
unexpected plot twist

361
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:21,080
is needed to crown the
climax, and bring our drama

362
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,840
to its bloody conclusion.

363
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,080
This isn't some kind of play.

364
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,080
This is real life!

365
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,720
But life is a play, Ren.

366
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,480
And unfortunately for you,
it's usually a tragedy.

367
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,760
Here's an example.

368
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,640
Right as Lapis is
about to kill Ayano,

369
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:36,000
Kazuma Yagami steps into
the scene just in time

370
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,080
to watch her die.

371
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,600
How glorious it would be.

372
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,200
Hey, you're right
there, aren't you, Ren?

373
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,000
What?

374
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,480
I'm here, Kazuma.

375
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,000
Ren, just call my name.

376
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,480
No matter where you
are, keep calling me.

377
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,280
No.

Impossible!

Hey, can you hear me?

Kazuma!

00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,400
No!

383
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,360
You can't!

384
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,400
Hey, Ren.

385
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,920
What's up, bro?

Kazuma!

That's quite an unbelievable
trick you just pulled.

It's you.

I almost didn't recognize
you in that get up.

Unbelievable.

You've got a lot of

in front of me, Bernhardt.

After I killed your boss,
Erwin, you should know better.

I spared your life once,
but now I'm wondering

402
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,400
if maybe that was a bad idea.

403
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,080
You always were
exceedingly arrogant.

404
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:06,000
There's only one reason
you've survived this long‐‐

405
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,520
because I've allowed you to stay
alive, treating you as nothing

406
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,200
more than a minor annoyance.

Well, thanks a lot.

I really appreciate you
allowing me to stay alive.

410
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,680
I can't say I'm planning
on returning the favor.

I've noticed that all Armagest
has been imposing lately,

little Tsui‐Ling lookalike was

your handiwork too, wasn't it?

Well?
