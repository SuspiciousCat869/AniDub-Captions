00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,560
After they download their powers
from the Pandemonium site,

168
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,480
these kids get together
and battle one another.

169
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:10,680
And whoever wins earns
points and gets stronger.

170
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:14,000
These competitions have been
happening almost every night.

171
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,720
The kids who accumulate
enough points

172
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,480
advance to the next class.

173
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:21,000
And once they've moved
up, they're called seeds.

174
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,840
From what we can tell, the
battle that happened here

175
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,840
last night drew quite a
crowd, because the fight

176
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:28,200
was between two
high‐level competitors.

177
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,400
You see those scratches?

178
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:32,040
AYANO: It looks like
they were caused by wind.

179
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:35,040
Inside sources say there's
a mysterious man who's been

180
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,760
relentlessly hunting the seeds.

181
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,440
They say he shows
up to the battles.

182
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,640
It looks like he
was here last night.

183
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,520
Apparently, this guy
presses the seeds

184
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,160
to the edge of death
for information

I grew stronger and
changed my class.

3rd class and have

No one will dare
disobey me again.

People will listen
to my every command.

me will be sorry now.

They'll grovel at my feet.

There's no real
need for us to stay.

As far as the plan is concerned,
we've covered our bases.

we do if we went back?

218
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,480
Besides, there may
be no reason to stay,

219
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:16,080
but there's no reason to
leave either, not when things

I don't know what you mean.

223
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,360
Is it because I'm not human?

224
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,840
Is that why I can't
understand these things?

225
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:30,760
It may be true that you
are not a human being.

But I created you to
have a mind and a spirit.

I know that if
you keep fighting,

you'll be able to see it.

Yes, but I'm afraid
I'm still uncertain.

It's all right to be confused.

It's all right to feel agonized.

Those emotions are human,
and ultimately, they

329
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,800
Kazuma would never do that.

330
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,840
Izumi and Catherine
confirmed it.

331
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,440
There's no way that
they would both mistake

332
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,160
him for someone else.

333
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,200
Then, there's the broken
barrier to consider.

334
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,080
And we know that Utsumi's
cursing power didn't do it.

335
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,120
An extremely powerful form of
wind magic broke that barrier.

336
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,880
So what does all of this mean?

337
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,520
Do you really believe
Kazuma kidnapped Nanase?

338
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,800
Do you think that maybe he
switched to Bernhardt's side

339
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,000
to be with that girl, Lapis?

340
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:33,760
No.

341
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,840
We don't think that's it.

342
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,920
Catherine and Izumi said
that after the barrier

343
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:39,920
was broken by Kazuma, Ms.
Kudou left of her own accord.

344
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:43,040
It was like she was being
controlled by someone.

345
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,680
In other words, Kazuma
didn't kidnap her.

346
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,200
Instead, he broke
down the barrier

347
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,280
and followed her from
the scene of the crime.

348
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,000
AYANO: But why would he
do something like that?

349
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,200
KIRIKA TACHIBANA:
For the same reason

350
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,040
he's been hunting down
those seeds every night.

351
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,560
He wants to find the
location of Pandemonium.

352
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:00,440
Basically, Kazuma used Nanase
as bait to lure Utsumi.

353
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:03,040
Sumi If he lets him kidnap
her and go on the loose,

354
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,000
Utsumi might be able
to give him clues

355
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,320
that will tell him if he's
heading in the right direction.

356
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,920
And if he's extremely
lucky, Utsumi

357
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,120
could lead him right to it.

358
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,520
AYANO: No way.

359
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,520
Kazuma is selfish,
violent, arrogant.

360
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,440
He's a lot of things.

361
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,240
Believe me.

362
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,600
I know him better than anyone.

363
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,640
But this isn't like him.

364
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,560
It's just not in his nature.

365
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,200
He would never put
another person's life

366
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,640
in danger like that.

367
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,200
The Kazuma I know is a
good person who cares

368
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,640
about doing the right thing.

369
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,880
He's not the kind of guy who
would do something like this.

370
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,520
You're right.

371
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:39,360
But the Kazuma I know
is much different.

372
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:43,080
I met Kazuma for the first
time about two years ago.

373
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,840
I was in London for training.

374
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,400
Back then, no one
really knew the man

375
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:50,240
named Kazuma Yagami by name.

376
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,040
But the rumors about
him were widespread.

377
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,920
People talked about
a wind magic user

378
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,760
who was like a
demon, a grim reaper

379
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,160
surrounded by frosty wind who
destroyed anything in his path.

380
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,320
And they were
talking about Kazuma?

381
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,160
Yes.

382
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:04,920
They were.

383
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:07,320
I finally met him when we were
working on a case together.

384
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:11,000
Suffice it to say, the
rumors were true enough.

385
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,120
He didn't think twice
about harming others.

386
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,920
If it was to his
advantage, he'd do just

387
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:17,600
about anything to solve a case.

388
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,280
When the assignment
was finally over,

389
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,560
I was relieved, to
tell you the truth.

390
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,800
I was thrilled,
because I'd never

391
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,680
have to see that man again.

392
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:30,800
But that's not the
person I know what all.

393
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,920
KIRIKA: Look, I know.

394
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,760
I was surprised too.

395
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:37,480
Since he came back,
Kazuma's changed.

396
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,680
It's like he's a completely
different person.

397
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:42,360
What do you mean?

398
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:45,320
What happened to him?

399
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,240
Hard to say.

400
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:50,000
I've told you everything I know.

401
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,680
What's important
right now is the fact

402
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:56,160
that Kazuma has reverted back to
his old self, a person who used

403
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,440
to be known as the Grim Reaper.

404
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,520
AYANO: His old self?

405
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,280
Are you sure?

406
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,400
KIRIKA: Yes.

407
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,880
Right now, Kazuma would do
whatever it takes to find

408
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,160
Pandemonium and kill Bernhardt.

409
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:10,120
If he has to destroy the
entire city in the process,

410
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:12,400
he'll do it, without
even blinking an eye,

411
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,000
even if it means victimizing
innocent people along the way.

412
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,160
He'll do what he has to
do to get the job done.

413
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:22,040
AYANO (VOICEOVER): Did he
change because he saw that girl?

414
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:25,760
Is that why he's
doing this, for Lapis?

415
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,720
No.

416
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,200
It couldn't be her.

417
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:31,720
She just reminded
him of Tsui‐Ling.

418
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:35,520
All right, then, Kazuma isn't
the person I used to know.

419
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,600
Not anymore.

420
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,280
We're here.

421
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:48,120
Ayano, if you do
face that girl again,

422
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,040
you have to defeat
her this time.

423
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,320
Huh?

424
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,240
Kazuma's caught
up in the past.

425
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,320
And he's lost
himself completely.

426
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,200
You have to remind
him of his new life

427
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,280
and why he decided to change.

428
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,920
You have to open his eyes.

429
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,680
You're the only one.

430
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,520
You can help him.

431
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:07,080
Please, there is
no one else, Ayano.

432
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,920
You have to stop
him, or no one will.

433
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,640
Everyone is counting on you.

434
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,440
You have to save Kazuma.

435
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:24,680
But how?

436
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:27,160
And why am I the only one?

437
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,880
Why am I the one
who can save him?
