And what exactly
do you think it

is that you're looking out for?

Well, it's kind of a
bold decision for you

44

to meet this guy at a

45
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,920
you might want some backup.

My father asked me to
come here and talk to him.

The only reason I'm here is
because I've got a job to do.

This is nothing but

Oh, a job to do?

That's actually the
first time you've said it.

All of the victims are young,
ranging from their late teens

to early 20s.

74

They've discovered
around two dozen victims

75
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,240
in just the last week, but going
by the missing persons report,

76
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,040
it might be closer to 100.

00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,000
Right.

So let me guess‐‐

Yeah.

Something like that.

82
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,400
The rebellion of the Fuga clan
has limited our capabilities.

83
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,240
Without their tracking skills,
we're forced to look elsewhere.

84
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,600
So we must now rely on
available resources.

85
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,400
Fine.

86
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,600
But why do we have
to rely on him?

87
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,440
Do you really believe
that you can find

88
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,520
the perpetrator on your own?

89
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,760
Ayano, you and Kazuma
are going to have

90
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,680
to work together as a team.

91
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,640
He will do his part
to find the enemy,

92
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,200
and you will defeat them.

93
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,840
Is that clear?

94
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,520
Yes.

95
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,880
So that's the deal.

96
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,360
You and I are splitting
this case 50/50.

97
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,160
Like it or not,
we're partners now.

98
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,760
The victims are shriveled
up and squeezed dry,

99
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:50,200
so all I gotta do is find
a yoma that sucks energy.

Hey!

101

to a word I said?

AYANO (VOICEOVER): He
seemed so worried about her.

103

I've never seen Kazuma
act that way before.

104
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,800
But why?

105
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,280
Why does he care
about Misao so much?

106
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,440
All right, I'll do it.

107
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,240
Huh?

108
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,280
Tell Jugo I'll take the job.

109
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,000
But there's no reason
for you to help.

110
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,760
What?

111
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,720
I'd use you if it was
a more powerful yoma,

112
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,440
but I can handle
this one on my own.

113
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,160
I don't want to risk
you getting in my way.

took from my brother.

make you pay no matter

were, and there's nothing

00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,520
she's brought shame
to our family‐‐

327
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:29,680
and the only recourse is to
annihilate her from this world.

328
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,160
Kill her?

329
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,520
AYANO (VOICEOVER):
How could a father say

330
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,120
that about his own daughter?

331
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,720
We have a new partner.

332
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,400
With their investigative
assistance,

333
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,600
we are making every
effort to find Misao.

334
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,040
A new partner?

335
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:41,920
That's right.

336
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,360
And once this source is able
to pinpoint her location,

337
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,720
the Ogami family will
deal with her immediately.

338
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,280
Master, I've been informed
that you had originally

339
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,400
hired Kazuma Yagmi for this.

340
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,800
Has it been brought
to his attention

341
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,160
that his services will
no longer be needed?

342
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:00,160
I've already told him that
he's been removed from the case.

343
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,080
But he warned me that
he would still proceed,

344
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,200
despite any repercussions.

345
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,360
Kazuma‐‐

346
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:09,120
AYANO (VOICEOVER): Why is he
so determined to save Misao?

347
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,040
After all she's done to him‐‐

348
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,840
is it because he likes her?

349
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:15,840
Master Jugo, even
if we mobilized

350
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:18,560
all of our available resources,
we can't afford the distraction

351
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,080
of Kazuma interfering.

352
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,600
We won't be able to
focus on destroying her.

353
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:27,640
I strongly urge you to do
whatever it takes to stop him.

354
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,640
Father, please
allow me to do it.

355
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,800
Are you sure?

356
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,600
Ayano‐‐

357
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,680
If you'll let me, I
will stop Kazuma Yagami.

358
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,520
From what we could
gather, we know that Misao

359
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,320
is hiding out in this church.

360
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,480
And you're certain about this?

361
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,280
Positive.

362
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,600
Our information network
is very reliable.

363
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,040
Our men are in the
process of setting

364
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,560
up a perimeter around the
block to keep people away.

365
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,320
It'll be ready in five minutes.

366
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,320
Be sure you're ready to move.

367
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,160
We will be.

368
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,080
So I'm guessing that you're
the new outside help that

369
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,040
my father's partnered with?

370
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,480
Yeah, I guess so.

371
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:16,640
Section Chief Metro Police
Special Investigations Unit,

372
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,480
Detective Kirika Tachibana.

373
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,680
Nice to properly
meet you, Ayano.

374
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,480
And it's nice to
meet you, too, Ren.

375
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,000
Who, me?

376
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,560
You're Kazuma Yagmi's
younger brother, aren't you?

377
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,240
Yeah, that's right.

378
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,880
Guess I'm kind of surprised.

379
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,360
I've heard rumors about
the police involved

380
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,120
in spiritual cases
before, but I didn't

381
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,480
think it was really true.

382
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,880
We don't exactly
have the resources

383
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,720
to compete with the Kannagis,
but we have our purpose.

384
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,600
And besides‐‐

385
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,080
Now that the Fuga
clan's gone, you can

386
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,320
take over the investigating.

387
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,240
That's what you were
going to say, right?

388
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,240
It was.

389
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,080
But it's also important
to us that we maintain

390
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,760
a good relationship with the
Kannagis‐‐ so if either of you

391
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,120
are interested in working for
us part time, let me know.

392
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,600
So is that what you
were doing with Kazuma

393
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,000
the other day when I saw you?

394
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,200
Recruiting?

395
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,280
Oh, is that what it
looked like I was doing?

396
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,880
Were you hoping I would
reassure you that I was only

397
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,560
discussing business with him?

398
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,160
Wha‐‐ why would I care?

399
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,320
That's not what I was asking!

400
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,200
Is that so?

401
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,000
Well, then, I don't see
the need to tell you.

402
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:12,760
Huh?

403
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,200
Whether it was
business or pleasure,

404
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,840
there's really no
reason for me to discuss

405
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,480
my personal life with you.

406
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:20,800
Why don't you ask Kazuma?

407
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,280
AYANO (VOICEOVER):
What's with this woman?

408
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,280
It's about to start.

409
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,160
Aren't you two supposed
to be helping them?

410
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,000
No.

411
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,120
We're actually here
for something else.

412
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,040
To stop him?

413
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:42,840
Yeah.

414
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:43,640
You guessed right.

415
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,840
Are you sure about this?

416
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:48,240
Trying to stop Kazuma
Yagami is no simple task.

417
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,240
Maybe so, but I'm
still their only shot.

418
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,120
Anyone else, and I doubt they'd
last three seconds against him.

419
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,840
But I might be able to hold him
off for about three minutes,

420
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:01,320
if everything goes as planned.

421
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,200
Don't get yourself killed.

422
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,240
I won't.

423
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,840
Because I've got
Ren here to help me.

424
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:06,640
What?

425
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,280
You didn't tell me I was
going to have to fight.

426
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,080
Ow, that hurts!

427
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:09,880
Stop it!

428
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,760
Ayano, let go fo me!

429
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,040
We're going to work
together on this, right, Ren?

430
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,120
Yeah, all right.

431
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,360
Sounds good.

432
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,680
Section two is now
fully sealed off.

433
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:23,200
We've secured section four.

434
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,120
Section one has been secured.

435
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,240
All sections now
sealed and secured.

436
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,720
It's a go.

437
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,560
Roger that.

438
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,280
Misao!

439
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:48,880
Welcome, everyone.

440
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,080
It's nice to see you all.

441
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,760
It's been a while.

442
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,400
Glad you could be here, Father.

443
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,200
I thought I might
not see you again.

444
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,240
Shut your mouth!

445
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,240
Despite the decisions
you've made with your life,

446
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,240
I still raised you.

447
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,160
And this is how you repay me?

448
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,720
It's unforgivable
to imagine that you

449
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,920
would willingly jeopardize the
existence of the Ogami family.

450
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:09,120
How dare you look me in the
eye and call me your father?

451
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,560
Well, I most
sincerely apologize.

452
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:14,360
But‐‐ out of curiosity,
where is Kazuma?

453
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,360
Isn't he here?

454
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,080
This has nothing
to do with him.

455
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,400
MISAO: What about Ayano?

456
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,680
I can't imagine her
staying home and passing

457
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:23,040
up the chance to destroy me.

458
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,600
Ayano has better things to
do than waste her time on you.

459
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,400
That's funny.

460
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,000
Because she seemed
so envious of me,

461
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,920
I just knew she would be here.

462
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,400
Maybe it was just
my imagination,

463
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,200
but I think she hated
the fact that Kazuma

464
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,560
paid more attention to me.

465
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,880
Are you OK, Ayano?

466
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:43,880
I should probably check it out
down there for a few minutes.

467
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:44,680
But wait!

468
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,240
You're not supposed
to go down there!

469
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,240
I'll be right back.

470
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,640
Sorry, Ayano‐‐ but it
looks like you've got a more

471
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,160
important issue to deal with.

472
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,320
Come on, Ren!

473
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,040
Stay right behind me!

474
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,040
Got it!

475
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,360
Well, now, time to get started.

[THEME MUSIC]

477
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,920
AYANO: If things get
serious out there,

478
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:10,480
will I really be able to
stand my ground with Kazuma?

479
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,480
You idiot!

480
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:14,320
Don't tell me you're actually
going to try to help Misao?

481
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,720
I can't believe you!

482
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:18,440
You're still going to protect
me and Ren, aren't you?

00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,240
What?

What do you mean?

Of course I'll do
everything in my power
