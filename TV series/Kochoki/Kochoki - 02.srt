Would you believe Oda

Is that so?

It's hard to believe.

00:00:46,964 --> 00:00:50,425
Nobuhide's illness must
be affecting his spirit.

00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:54,805
This is an opportunity
I never dared hope for.

[KICHOU]
Oda Nobunaga.

When the world was at war,
he eclipsed it like a demon god.

Though much has
been written about him,

the man I knew differed
from the legend.

Yes.

We've already

This stays between us,

That's what this is about?

Nobunaga‐<i>sama</i>, you'll
forgive me for being so blunt,

You do not have

As your advisors,

You'd pair me with
the daughter of "The Viper"?

42
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:55,444
[TSUNEOKI] Sealing an alliance
with Mino would allow us

to quell internal unrest.

00:03:57,779 --> 00:04:01,158
And strengthen our stance
against Mikawa and Suruga.

You have to admit,
it's a win‐win.

This is the Lady of Mino.

Renowned for being the greatest

until you've spent
some time together.

[FEMALE VILLAGER]
What is that thing?

00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:39,102
[NOBUNAGA]
Stay or flee, it's up to you.

165
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:39,728
But you should know,

166
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:42,105
there're more lead balls
where that came from.

[BRIGAND A]
Let's get outta here!

00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:53,283
Good thing they ran,
since I can only use this once.

170
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:54,909
The other problem is
with the barrel's length.

171
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:57,370
It's never hit a single target.

172
00:08:57,412 --> 00:08:58,788
You realize you're terrible.

Yeah, but where?

[NOBUNAGA]
Who knows?

[TAKUGEN chuckles]

182
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:13,595
That boy never fails
to surprise me.

183
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:16,139
Who could've foreseen he'd be
unable to wait until the wedding

184
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:19,434
and would sneak off
to see the Lady of Mino?

185
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:21,227
This is no laughing matter!

186
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:23,271
Imagine if a mishap
were to occur!

187
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:25,774
The reconciliation with
Mino would be called off.

188
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:26,983
In addition to that,

189
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:30,779
it would give their forces a
pretext to cross the Kiso River.

190
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,947
I was saying it
from the very beginning.

191
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:35,116
If we were arranging a marriage,
it should have been

192
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:37,535
with Kanjuurou‐<i>sama</i>
and not his older brother.

193

Don't be unreasonable!

194
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:40,288
The boy hasn't come of age.

195
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:41,998
He's too young.

196
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:42,874
Sound the horns!

197
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,626
Now!

198
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:46,169
Assemble the troops!

We're rescuing Nobunaga!

[KATSUIE] If we cross
the Kiso River with an army,

203
00:09:55,887 --> 00:09:57,806
the war will start
all over again!

[HIDESADA]
We're advisors! Let us advise!

I'll lure them
further into the woods.

206

When you see an opening, run.

No. We're escaping together.

208
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:16,616
A retainer puts himself at risk
in order to protect his lord.

209
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:18,076
That's his job.

210
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:19,160
And I'm telling you,

00:10:19,202 --> 00:10:21,287
if you gave up your
life to save mine,

to steal a glimpse at
the Lady of Mino's visage.

Is this true?

If Nobunaga‐<i>sama</i> fails
to return from Mino,

Owari will search for him

before crossing the Kiso.

a feeling like
this in all my life.

and the name Nobukatsu
was bestowed upon him.

Also, at this time, to keep

that way at his wedding.

00:16:45,046 --> 00:16:48,007
Tsuneoki!

326
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,843
It's fine.

327
00:16:50,885 --> 00:16:52,220
As long as I don't
leave an opening,

328
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:54,305
the Viper's poison won't get me.

329
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:56,891
And I have this
concealed chamber.

330
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:10,947
[gasps] How did you...?

331
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:13,741
I wanted to make sure you
didn't end up catching a cold.

332
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:15,493
But the lock.

333
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:17,870
Funny, I didn't notice
a lock on the door.

334
00:17:17,912 --> 00:17:19,622
[gasps]

335
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,918
[gasps]

336
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:24,710
A trap!

337
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:27,964
As if she didn't lace this
with a deadly poison!

338
00:17:29,257 --> 00:17:30,883
Oh, Nobunaga?

339
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:33,886
What're you eating?

340
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:34,929
This?

341
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:37,348
Just some delicious food
Kichou prepared for me.

342
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:38,891
Spit it out!
Right this instant!

343
00:17:38,933 --> 00:17:39,892
Calm down.

344
00:17:39,934 --> 00:17:42,895
I'm sure she wouldn't mind
making you some more.

345
00:17:42,937 --> 00:17:44,605
Well that hit the spot.

346
00:17:46,524 --> 00:17:50,319
[KICHOU chuckles]
Wow, great.

347
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:03,457
Kichou?

348
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:06,586
An assassin?

349
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:09,380
You're not laughing.

350
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:11,215
The truth is,
this wouldn't be

351
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:13,884
the first time Kichou‐<i>dono</i>
was married to someone.

352
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:16,095
[NOBUNAGA gasps]
Do you mean...?

353
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:17,930
We were careless.

354
00:18:17,972 --> 00:18:20,850
With Nobuhide‐<i>sama</i>
downed by his illness,

355
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:23,352
the Owari province would be
instantly splintered apart

356
00:18:23,394 --> 00:18:25,563
if you were to be killed.

357
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:27,565
Even if we were to
eliminate Kichou‐<i>dono</i>

358
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:30,151
before she has
the chance to strike.

359
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:34,572
Dousan would then be given
just cause for invading Owari.

360
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:37,700
Avenging his daughter's death.

361
00:18:37,742 --> 00:18:38,784
Ruthless.

362
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:41,370
He's not called
"The Viper" just for show.

363
00:18:41,412 --> 00:18:43,122
Why doesn't she
get it over with?

364
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:45,249
Or, maybe she enjoys
watching me cower,

365
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:48,711
like a cat that enjoys toying
with a mouse before eating it.

366
00:18:48,753 --> 00:18:50,504
[TAKUGEN]
I'd suggest putting yourself

367
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:52,757
in her position, my lord.

368
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,925
Who? Kichou?

369
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:55,676
Once you do,

370
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:58,888
I suspect the answer will
become clear to you.

371
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:03,476
[KICHOU]
What is this?

372
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:06,228
A message. From your father.

373
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,481
He says to finish off Nobunaga.

374
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:10,775
After that, you can return home.

375
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:12,443
I understand.

376
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:13,986
It's just...

377
00:19:14,028 --> 00:19:16,447
I feel a pain in my bosom.

378
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:18,616
Has your wound
not fully healed yet?

379
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:20,159
If so, I could kill him for y‐‐

380
00:19:20,201 --> 00:19:21,285
No, Kaede.

381
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:23,245
It's fine.

382
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:24,997
Leave it.

383
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:27,249
Why are you in here?

384
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:29,835
I felt parched
and needed a drink.

385
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:32,046
Come on. Let's walk

386
00:19:39,053 --> 00:19:39,970
Is it far?

387
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,639
What do you want to show me?

388
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,517
We're almost there.

389
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:52,358
You can only see this
when there's a full moon.

390
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,444
It's a special sal tree.

391
00:19:56,487 --> 00:19:58,072
[KICHOU]
Why bring me here?

392
00:19:58,114 --> 00:19:59,782
[NOBUNAGA]
It has another name.

393
00:19:59,824 --> 00:20:01,951
The Nirvana Tree.

394
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:03,661
If I'm to die,

395
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:06,122
I want this to be my last sight.

396
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:11,669
[KICHOU]
As you wish.

397
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:15,756
But I won't go quietly.

398
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:17,174
If I die tonight,

399
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:21,095
Takugen will share the
circumstances of my demise.

400
00:20:21,137 --> 00:20:23,264
Using my death
as a rallying cry,

401
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:27,393
the Oda will unite and likely
call for Mino's destruction.

402
00:20:32,857 --> 00:20:34,316
[NOBUNAGA]
Stop!

403
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:39,572
[KICHOU]
If I don't fulfill my mission.

404
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:43,868
It's over, and I can never
return home to my father.

405
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:46,412
Kill me.

406
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:49,540
If you died, it would
only cause more problems.

407
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:51,292
Are you that afraid of it?

408
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,210
Stirring up trouble with Mino?

409
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,211
[NOBUNAGA grunts]

410
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:56,589
That's not what I
was talking about!

411
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:57,590
Damn it!

412
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:04,972
You don't think I understand how
much you look up to your father?

413
00:21:05,014 --> 00:21:07,683
But what about you?

414
00:21:07,725 --> 00:21:12,438
How much thought has
he given his daughter?

415
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,900
Here you are, plying your trade
while carrying these scars.

416
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:18,194
Does he care
what happens to you?

417
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:25,659
You said you
can't return to him.

418
00:21:28,204 --> 00:21:31,624
[NOBUNAGA]
Then stay here by my side.

419
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:34,126
Imagine if word got out
my bride left me.

420
00:21:34,168 --> 00:21:36,253
Do you know how
terrible that'd look?

421
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:38,422
People would think I was awful.

422
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:57,942
[DOUSAN]
What?

423
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:59,485
And he still took her in?

424
00:21:59,527 --> 00:22:01,695
Yes.

425
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:03,072
I never could have imagined

426
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:06,492
he'd willingly accept
poison from the Viper.

427
00:22:06,534 --> 00:22:09,203
So, they call him Nobunaga, huh?

428
00:22:09,245 --> 00:22:10,871
Very amusing.
