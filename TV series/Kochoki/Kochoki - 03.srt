1
00:00:27,819 --> 00:00:29,613
How about that?

2
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:32,574
[RETAINER A]
You hit the target, my lord!

3
00:00:32,616 --> 00:00:34,117
[NOBUNAGA]
Of course, I did.

4
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:38,539
[TOSHIIE] Nobunaga‐<i>sama</i>!
I request a favor!

5
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,165
Who are you?

6
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:42,125
I come from the Maeda clan!

7
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:43,502
I'm the fourth son.

8
00:00:43,544 --> 00:00:45,629
My name's Inuchiyo!

9
00:00:45,671 --> 00:00:47,965
Though I'm Hayashi
Hidesada‐<i>sama</i>'s assistant.

10
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:49,967
I'm prepared to give
my life to serve you!

11
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:52,719
Please let me join you, my lord.

12
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:53,845
Terribly sorry.

13
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:55,055
I'll clean the stables!

14
00:00:55,097 --> 00:00:56,223
Be a poison‐taster!

15
00:00:56,265 --> 00:00:58,183
Anything! Just let me serve you!

16
00:00:58,225 --> 00:01:00,602
Apologies for the intrusion.

17
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:02,437
No harm was done.

18
00:01:02,521 --> 00:01:04,398
Did you notice
his style of dress?

19
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:06,900
It was quite similar
to yours, Nobunaga‐<i>sama</i>.

20
00:01:06,942 --> 00:01:09,611
Huh? You mean that's
what I look like?

21
00:02:42,788 --> 00:02:44,665
[TSUNEOKI]
Nobunaga‐<i>sama</i>, isn't it time

22
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:48,502
you paid a sickbed visit to
the Lord of Suemori Castle?

23
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:50,420
I know I should.

24
00:02:50,462 --> 00:02:51,505
It's just that my father

25
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:54,257
always used to be this
larger‐than‐life presence.

26
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:56,218
Having his son see him this way,

27
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:59,680
it might cause him
to become dispirited.

28
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:01,139
When I think about
the eventuality of him

29
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:05,477
losing the battle
with his illness, I just...

30
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,229
I know how you feel,

31
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,940
but please explain it
to everyone else.

32
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:12,150
Everyone else?

33
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,235
We have guests.

34
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:15,320
Your younger brother
and the retainers.

35
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:17,614
They're waiting for you
in the reception room.

36
00:03:17,656 --> 00:03:20,325
All of 'em are here?

37
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:21,159
[sighs]

38
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:22,911
You should've told me.

39
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:28,083
[NOBUKATSU] It's been
a while, elder brother.

40
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:31,044
Since you apparently refuse
to travel to Suemori Castle,

41
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:35,090
Nobunaga‐<i>sama</i>, we're forced
to come calling on you instead.

42
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:36,174
Sorry.

43
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:40,011
So, tell me, how has Father's
condition been recently?

44
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:44,099
He's desperately
struggling against the illness.

45
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:45,851
I see.

46
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:46,810
[HIDESADA]
Forgive me.

47
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:49,896
To broach the subject,
should the unthinkable happen.

48
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:52,607
How will you handle
reconciling with Ishigawa?

49
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:54,818
The negotiations could collapse,

50
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:57,195
and one slip up
could mean invasion.

51
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,990
Hmm. While we're extremely
fortunate Nobuhiro‐<i>sama</i>

52
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:01,992
was able to return unscathed,

53
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:05,203
we've lost whatever influence
we once had in Mikawa.

54
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,706
Preparations for war
must be made immediately.

55
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:11,168
[NOBUKATSU]
Enough!

56
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:13,295
The political
discussions can wait!

57
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:15,046
My brother's first and
foremost thoughts should be

58
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:17,507
with our father's well‐being.

59
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:19,050
[YAMAGUCHI]
What were you thinking?

60
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:22,095
Here you are, already talking
as though the Lord has passed.

61
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:24,473
A little restraint,
if you would.

62
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:26,600
Apologies, Nobunaga‐<i>sama</i>.

63
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:28,310
I know how you feel.

64
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:29,811
Yamaguchi‐<i>dono</i>.

65
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:31,605
I'm grateful.

66
00:04:32,314 --> 00:04:35,108
[NOBUKATSU] Sorry for being
so presumptuous earlier.

67
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:38,779
I forgot my place and shouldn't
have scolded the retainers.

68
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,322
[NOBUNAGA]
Don't apologize.

69
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:43,116
[NOBUKATSU] It's not that I
don't understand how they feel,

70
00:04:43,158 --> 00:04:48,789
but the future only
makes me feel uneasy.

71
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,040
Don't worry.

72
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:52,167
You're not alone.

73
00:04:52,876 --> 00:04:55,045
I'm filled with anxiety as well.

74
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:57,255
Thanks, but I
would've preferred

75
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,966
if you told me you had
everything under control.

76
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:01,968
[laughs]

77
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,553
It really should be you.

78
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:04,930
The Oda clan
deserves to be ruled

79
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:07,057
by the responsible brother.

80
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:09,518
All the retainers
think so too, right?

81
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:11,728
Of course they don't.

82
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:14,064
[KATSUIE] With that scatter‐
brain Nobunaga‐<i>sama</i> leading us,

83
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:17,108
who knows where our
clan's future is headed?

84
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,735
[NOBUNAGA]
I've hit the nail on the head.

85
00:05:18,777 --> 00:05:19,945
Huh? What?

86
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:20,946
That's crazy!

87
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:21,947
You're the eldest son,

88
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:25,700
and no one questions that
you should inherit control.

89
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:29,538
Since I'm younger,
my role will be minor.

90
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:30,872
To be honest,

91
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:33,542
I'm kind of envious of you.

92
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,752
You spent more time with Father.

93
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:39,172
I wish I had those memories.

94
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:43,510
That may be true, but...

95
00:05:43,552 --> 00:05:47,055
Regardless, when
the time finally comes,

96
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:50,433
we'll hold a memorable
service for our father.

97
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:51,142
Hey.

98
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,395
Why are you sounding
so pessimistic?

99
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:56,565
The man's strong and there's
still a chance he could recover!

100
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:57,774
And you know what?

101
00:05:57,816 --> 00:06:00,569
I'll go in search of
Chinese medicine tomorrow.

102
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:01,820
You're right.

103
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:03,697
There's hope.

104
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:05,574
As for me,
I'll stop by the temples

105
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:07,868
and request prayers for him.

106
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:12,789
[TSUNEOKI]
Going out, my lord?

107
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:13,790
Yes.

108
00:06:13,832 --> 00:06:16,668
We're off to Tsushima to
look for foreign medicines.

109
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:17,919
I'll come with you.

110
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:19,129
[NOBUNAGA]
Don't worry.

111
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:21,423
Kichou and I will
be perfectly safe.

112
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:22,799
Watch things here.

113
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:24,301
As you wish, my lord.

114
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:26,011
Please be careful.

115
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:52,746
I didn't think it'd
be this much of a hunt.

116
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:01,630
Found it.

117
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:04,007
What do you have there, my lord?

118
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:07,135
[NOBUNAGA] A souvenir
my father gave me long ago.

119
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:08,678
Starting from a very young age,

120
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,890
we lived separately
and I rarely saw him.

121
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:14,643
But one day
he visited the castle

122
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:18,271
and brought me this
spinning top as a gift.

123
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:19,648
That such an
unstable thing spun

124
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:22,192
without toppling
was so mysterious.

125
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:24,486
I remember trying it myself.

126
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:27,197
[laughs]
That's my boy!

127
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:30,909
[NOBUNAGA] Father was laughing
so hard, amused by my antics.

128
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:32,243
I didn't want to stop.

129
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:36,039
So I kept going,
keeping him entertained.

130
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:37,207
I think you're lucky to have

131
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:39,668
such a pleasant
memory of His Lordship.

132
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,522
There's no reason to be alarmed.

133
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:05,485
My husband trusts you
completely, Tsuneoki‐<i>dono</i>.

134
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:07,404
I envy you.

135
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:09,197
Whether it's in
public or in private,

136
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:12,158
you always remain by
Nobunaga‐<i>sama</i>'s side.

137
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,827
While that may
be true, I daresay,

138
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:15,954
you play an even more
crucial role in his life

139
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:18,665
which even I cannot fulfill.

140
00:08:18,707 --> 00:08:21,251
You mean bearing an heir.

141
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:24,212
We're similar.

142
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:25,839
You and I.

143
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,007
If necessary,

144
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:30,260
I'm prepared to give up
my life in exchange for his.

145
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:33,346
[KICHOU]
You doubt me?

146
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:34,639
No.

147
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:37,225
You're a perfect match
for Nobunaga‐<i>sama</i>.

148
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:40,437
I wish you were afforded
the same freedoms as him.

149
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:47,193
[WOMAN screams]

150
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:52,323
Stop him!

151
00:08:57,787 --> 00:08:58,580
[NOBUNAGA]
A traitor?

152
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:00,373
Among our own retainers?

153
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,374
[TSUNEOKI]
For quite some time,

154
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:03,293
I've been quietly
gathering information,

155
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:05,045
attempting to
discover who they are.

156
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:07,172
The man who killed
himself was a spy.

157
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:10,550
Sent under the traitor's
orders to infiltrate the clan.

158
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:11,801
Who would betray me?

159
00:09:11,843 --> 00:09:13,344
And for what purpose?

160
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:14,637
We don't know.

161
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:16,723
But whatever their
true objective is.

162
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:20,268
I think it's clear,
we have the Imagawa to thank.

163
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:21,478
Unthinkable!

164
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,979
Every single one
of the retainers fought

165
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:24,939
alongside my father!

166
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:27,150
And I would ask you
to remember the other day.

167
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:30,612
When every single one of
them expressed concern.

168
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:32,947
Given that, a traitor
seems highly likely.

169
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:33,907
How dare you!

170
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:36,868
Accusing my trusted advisors
without a shred of evidence!

171
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,454
It's obvious you have no faith
in my father's judgement!

172
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:41,706
I have no faith
in your complacency!

173
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:42,957
My what?

174
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:47,462
You are not to speak of this!

175
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:48,296
Got it?

176
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:51,508
Until further notice,
I don't want to see your face!

177
00:09:57,013 --> 00:10:00,183
[NOBUNAGA] Who on earth
would betray the Oda?

178
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:02,852
And with my father still alive?

179
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:09,943
Something bothering you?

180
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:11,152
For some reason,

181
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:15,323
Nobunaga‐<i>sama</i> hasn't been
acting like himself as of late.

182
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:17,659
What do you suppose happened?

183
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,411
[HIRATE] It's probably
his worries piling up.

184
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:24,499
I invited him to go falconing in
an attempt to raise his spirits.

185
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,709
But he told me
he wasn't interested

186
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:29,129
and preferred to stay in.

187
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:35,802
A favor, please!

188
00:10:35,844 --> 00:10:37,720
I wish to be of some service!

189
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:38,888
Poison‐taster!

190
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:40,348
Anything!

191
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:43,601
I will now proceed
tasting for poisons.

192
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:52,819
So good!

193
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:56,072
I've never tasted
anything that delicious!

194
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,867
Please, I request a favor!

195
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:00,952
Allow me to be of
some service at the stables!

196
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:02,662
Any job will do!

197
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:06,207
Clean out and
replace all the hay.

198
00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:07,917
Sir!

199
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:10,044
You're Nobunaga‐<i>sama</i>'s
favorite steed?

200
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:11,921
Aw, you're so lucky!

201
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:15,758
[TOSHIIE]
Ooo, I know!

202
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,511
Wait for me!

203
00:11:18,553 --> 00:11:19,762
[NOBUNAGA]
What's all the noise?

204
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:21,097
[HIRATE]
Not sure.

205
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:28,980
[TOSHIIE]
Wait up!

206
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:34,277
[RETAINER D]
Humblest apologies, my lord!

207
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:35,445
It certainly took a while,

208
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:39,115
but it appears the horse
has finally settled down.

209
00:11:39,157 --> 00:11:40,867
Though whatever
you decide is absolute,

210
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:44,537
I ask you judge this child
with leniency for his actions.

211
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:45,997
[TOSHIIE]
I beg your forgiveness!

212
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:47,916
I only wanted to make
the steed look as elegant

213
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:50,418
as the hero who rides it!

214
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:57,967
[laughs]

215
00:11:58,009 --> 00:12:01,054
I admit, that's a
pretty good look for you.

216
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:02,847
Needed a run, huh?

217
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:05,558
We haven't had one
in a while, have we?

218
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:07,518
Hirate!

219
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,395
What would you say
to some falconing?

220
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:12,190
Oh! Of course, my lord!

221
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:16,903
As for you, you're coming too.

222
00:12:16,945 --> 00:12:18,488
Sure!

223
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:27,080
I see one.

224
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:28,706
That way.

225
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:39,884
[RETAINERS congratulate]

226
00:12:44,222 --> 00:12:44,973
You were right.

227
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:46,182
Thank you.

228
00:12:46,224 --> 00:12:48,977
That did raise my spirits.

229
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:52,105
[HIRATE] Perhaps Inuchiyo
deserves most of the credit.

230
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:54,691
[NOBUNAGA]
If he's going to be a page,

231
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:56,109
he'll need thorough training.

232
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,610
It will be done.

233
00:12:57,652 --> 00:13:01,364
I was wondering, did something
happen between you and Tsuneoki?

234
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:04,033
Huh? I mean, not really.

235
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:04,784
Well, good.

236
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:06,619
Just seems like you two
have been putting distance

237
00:13:06,661 --> 00:13:08,746
between yourselves recently.

238
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,164
But then again,
you're married now,

239
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:12,250
so I imagine he's
simply being respectful

240
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:14,127
and choosing to give you space.

241
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:15,086
It's doubtful.

242
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:16,838
For as long as I've known him,
he's been forward

243
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:19,757
to an incredibly
annoying degree, actually.

244
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:22,260
Since childhood,
he's always been at my back

245
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:24,470
and never afraid to chime in.

246
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:26,681
[TSUNEOKI]
Don't run away!

247
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:29,058
A leader stands their
ground at all times!

248
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,978
He never backs down, no
matter the enemy he's facing!

249
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,938
[NOBUNAGA]
This is a boar!

250
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,065
Remember, you are
the heir apparent to Oda,

251
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:37,817
Lord Protector of Mikawa.

252
00:13:37,859 --> 00:13:39,068
Did you really think that girl

253
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:41,237
would make a
worthy match for you?

254
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:42,864
If you're set on marriage,

255
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:45,366
a daughter of the
Ashikaga would be best.

256
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:47,952
Why did you agree to
go along with their plan?

257
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:51,414
He loves telling me
how I should live my life.

258
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:54,667
Yes, and yet, no matter
how dangerous the situation,

259
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:57,962
isn't he always the first
to come to your defense?

260
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:00,631
How dare you charge him!

261
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:03,801
I'll lure them away.

262
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,595
Run for it!

263
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:09,474
We've talked about
him enough for today.

264
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:19,776
I'll have them
clear a path for us.

265
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:20,777
No need.

266
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:23,488
It's less trouble
for us to back up.

267
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:31,037
[BOY]
Grandfather!

268
00:14:31,913 --> 00:14:33,998
[NOBUNAGA]
It's a funeral procession.

269
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,125
[HIRATE] The poor cannot
afford much of a ceremony,

270
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:38,211
usually only something simple.

271
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:39,420
Interesting though.

272
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:42,882
Usually it's seen as a relief,
having one less mouth to feed.

273
00:14:42,924 --> 00:14:46,094
Whoever they were,
they must have been well loved.

274
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:53,851
[TAKUGEN] What about this
peasant's funeral intrigues you?

275
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:56,646
[NOBUNAGA] The feeling
that was surrounding it.

276
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:59,565
When my father passes away.

277
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:00,691
I see it now.

278
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:03,277
It'll be a magnificent
funeral service.

279
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:07,240
But how will the
retainers really feel?

280
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:08,741
All around the world.

281
00:15:08,783 --> 00:15:11,744
A wide variety of funeral
rituals are practiced.

282
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:14,080
Letting birds eat the
remains of the deceased.

283
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:16,874
Even celebrations
involving joyous dancing.

284
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:17,917
Huh?

285
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:19,085
Seriously?

286
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:21,254
The world truly is a vast place.

287
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:24,006
But regardless of the
form the ceremony takes,

288
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:26,467
as long as it's performed
with a sincere spirit,

289
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:29,345
it will be experienced
by the departed.

290
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:31,681
That's because, after death,

291
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:35,226
the deceased exist
only in the spirit form.

292
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:44,735
[KICHOU]
In April of the year 1551,

293
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:48,614
Oda Nobuhide‐<i>sama</i> passed away.

294
00:15:58,666 --> 00:15:59,959
[NOBUNAGA]
No, it won't do!

295
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,794
This is for my father's funeral,

296
00:16:01,836 --> 00:16:04,672
and I don't want a
single detail overlooked!

297
00:16:04,714 --> 00:16:05,631
Great.

298
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:08,509
Of course Tsuneoki's gone
when I need him here.

299
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:09,719
[KICHOU]
Nobunaga‐<i>sama</i>.

300
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:13,848
Yes, what is it?

301
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:17,477
I was sworn to secrecy,
but I need to tell you.

302
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:20,855
Tsuneoki‐<i>dono</i>, he set
out earlier for the forest,

303
00:16:20,897 --> 00:16:22,106
pursuing a spy.

304
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:23,232
What?

305
00:16:23,274 --> 00:16:24,025
[KICHOU]
Apparently, they stole

306
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:27,236
the Certificate
of Protectorship.

307
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:28,404
[NOBUNAGA]
That document.

308
00:16:28,446 --> 00:16:31,365
It was entrusted to my father
by the Shiba Buei house,

309
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:33,451
the guardians of Owari.

310
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:37,288
If it's taken from us, our power
would be stripped away.

311
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:40,333
We'd lose the right
to rule the Owari Province.

312
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:43,586
Then whatever's to come,
allow me to handle it.

313
00:16:43,628 --> 00:16:46,964
Huh? You still
serving as a ninja?

314
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,299
Stay here. I'll go.

315
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:49,509
But you can't!

316
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:52,136
Tomorrow is
your father's funeral!

317
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:55,014
[NOBUNAGA] By getting
that certificate back,

318
00:16:55,056 --> 00:16:57,266
along with
capturing the traitor.

319
00:16:57,308 --> 00:16:59,727
That's how I'll pay
my respects to him!

320
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:03,064
This seems be the
right path, my lord!

321
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:06,692
[NOBUNAGA] Please don't
do anything rash, Tsuneoki!

322
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:21,249
[TOSHIIE]
And bullseye!

323
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:23,751
Nobunaga‐<i>sama</i> is gonna
love your feathers!

324
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:24,418
Huh?

325
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,087
Who're they?

326
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:29,423
We should be close!

327
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:43,896
Tell me who you're working for!

328
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:47,400
Nobody betrays my clan!

329
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:48,818
You hear me?

330
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:50,903
[SPY D]
What the?

331
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:53,155
Take that!

332
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:55,408
Got him!

333
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:56,993
Leave them to me, my lord!

334
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:58,536
What are you doing here?!

335
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:00,079
Little cur!

336
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:03,499
Huh?

337
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:17,179
Kichou!

338
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:20,391
What am I going to do with you?

339
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:23,144
Hurry and catch up
with Tsuneoki‐<i>dono</i>.

340
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:33,529
[roars]

341
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:40,077
Go ahead and try!

342
00:18:41,871 --> 00:18:43,205
Huh?

343
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:49,670
Tsuneoki!

344
00:18:49,712 --> 00:18:50,713
[TSUNEOKI]
I don't understand.

345
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:51,505
How did you know?

346
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:52,632
There's no way
Kichou would keep

347
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:55,134
this a secret from me.

348
00:18:55,176 --> 00:18:56,927
Yes, so it would seem.

349
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:59,305
The Certificate.

350
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:02,975
You tried to warn me,
but I wouldn't listen.

351
00:19:03,017 --> 00:19:05,853
I didn't want to consider it.

352
00:19:05,895 --> 00:19:08,814
The thought of
a traitor among us.

353
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:10,608
Yes.

354
00:19:13,444 --> 00:19:15,780
So, where does this road lead?

355
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,490
To Narumi Castle.

356
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:20,326
That must mean
Yamaguchi was the conspirator.

357
00:19:20,368 --> 00:19:23,079
Here you are, already talking
as though the Lord has passed.

358
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,623
A little restraint,
if you wouldn't mind.

359
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:29,251
[NOBUNAGA]
I don't get it.

360
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:31,545
Why would a retainer who served
loyally under my father

361
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:34,757
for years suddenly betray us?

362
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:35,841
He judged the situation

363
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:38,177
and fled to what he thought
was the winning side.

364
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:40,763
It's commonplace during war.

365
00:19:40,805 --> 00:19:42,348
[NOBUNAGA] So, does
that mean from this point,

366
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:44,100
now and forever...

367
00:19:47,228 --> 00:19:50,815
[NOBUNAGA] ...I have to go
through life distrusting people?

368
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:55,903
Never when it comes
to me, my lord.

369
00:19:55,945 --> 00:19:58,531
Whatever happens, I'll be here.

370
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:00,241
Forever.

371
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:03,661
It's true.

372
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:04,704
I've been trying to block out

373
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:06,997
anything I didn't
want to confront.

374
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,792
Like a child
afraid of being hurt.

375
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:11,419
I'm sorry.

376
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:15,423
Keep standing by me
in the days to come.

377
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:17,091
Tsuneoki.

378
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:18,551
Lord.

379
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:37,528
Why hasn't Nobunaga made it yet?

380
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:39,697
I don't know.

381
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:40,614
Brother.

382
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:43,117
Didn't we make a promise?

383
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:45,828
That we'd have a memorable
service honoring him?

384
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:49,665
He's late showing up
for his own father's funeral.

385
00:20:49,707 --> 00:20:51,751
Even he can't be
that thoughtless.

386
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:55,671
I'm sure he'll be
arriving at any moment now.

387
00:20:55,713 --> 00:20:58,799
The recent storms must have made
the roads difficult for travel.

388
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:01,510
Or perhaps he was struck
by sudden illness and‐‐

389
00:21:01,552 --> 00:21:03,512
Hirate.

390
00:21:03,554 --> 00:21:04,889
Right.

391
00:21:17,735 --> 00:21:19,987
[NOBUNAGA]
To perish is destiny.

392
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:22,740
Yet remembrances
of what we endeavored

393
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:25,284
are destined to endure.

394
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:29,663
[KICHOU]
"The fate of humans is to die.

395
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:33,334
But what we accomplish in life,
takes form and remains.

396
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:35,461
Passed on to posterity."

397
00:21:35,503 --> 00:21:36,754
And though these words could be

398
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:41,300
seen as merely an apology
typical of Nobunaga.

399
00:21:42,051 --> 00:21:44,762
[KATSUIE] I believe
the note speaks for itself.

400
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:48,808
Our hopes for Owari's
stability are in jeopardy.

401
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:50,184
Nobukatsu‐<i>sama</i>.

402
00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:53,896
You're more fit
to inherit leadership.

403
00:21:53,938 --> 00:21:56,148
[KICHOU] Thereafter,
Yamaguchi‐<i>dono</i> parted

404
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:57,900
with the Oda Clan.

405
00:21:57,942 --> 00:21:59,527
The ruthlessness
of a world at war

406
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:04,073
weighed heavily upon
Nobunaga‐<i>sama</i>'s heart.

407
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:05,825
Yet, it was also at this moment

408
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:08,744
when his determination
to confront destiny,

409
00:22:08,786 --> 00:22:09,745
and the resolve of those

410
00:22:09,787 --> 00:22:13,707
who continued to stay by
his side was reawakened.
