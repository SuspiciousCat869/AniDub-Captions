00:09:12,844 --> 00:09:17,182
If you're both alive,
then I'm... dreaming.

165
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:20,810
Why are you crying,
Elder Brother?

166
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:22,312
[NOBUNAGA]
I'm in this field.

167
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:23,438
Young again.

168
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,190
And it seems that
I'm learning the basics

169
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:27,817
of falconing with Kanjuurou.

170
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:29,110
Listen.

171
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:31,071
In order to capture your prey,

172
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:33,698
the first step is to let
them become careless.

173
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,617
How do I do that?

174
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:38,453
[NOBUHIDE]
Vanish into the trees and grass.

175
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:42,791
Match your breath to the wind's
rhythm, until the prey appears.

176
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:45,460
Be still and wait.

177
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:46,878
There!

178
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,213
Not yet.

[NOBUNAGA]
We got it!

00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:05,897
Father, look!

182
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:09,400
[NOBUNAGA]
Father.

183
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:13,988
Is something wrong?

184
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,824
I was having a dream.

185
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:17,534
A dream?

186
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:23,123
In it, my father and Nobukatsu
taught me how to wage this war.

187
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:24,874
[NOBUNAGA]
Call them all here.

188
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:28,128
Imagawa's army is advancing.

189
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:32,132
But pushing for Kiyosu in a
single stroke seems unlikely.

190
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:33,258
Later.

191
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:35,426
When he's stationed
troops in Kutsukake,

192
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:38,847
he's likely to target Odaka
and Narumi Castles.

193
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:42,016
If so, presumably he'll move
his troops along ridgelines

194
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:44,310
that allow for good visibility.

195
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:46,354
Ten thousand's a force.

196
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:48,982
Naturally, the ranks
will be extended.

197
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:49,816
In other words,

198
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:52,152
Imagawa won't be
heavily protected.

199
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:54,904
I'd say he'll have
2,000 troops guarding him.

200
00:10:54,946 --> 00:10:56,072
I see.

201
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:58,324
So we flank that point
and attack him?

202
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:01,744
Still, the general could be
anywhere within the ranks.

203
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:03,621
We won't know his location.

204
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,165
Yes, we will.

205
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:07,208
We'll meet Imagawa's vanguard

206
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,294
by equipping Washizu
and Marune Fortresses

207
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:12,964
with as many muskets
as we're able to transport.

208
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:14,340
With his superior numbers,

209
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:17,302
Imagawa will no doubt move
his main squad into the fray,

210
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:20,096
bent on crushing them
through sheer force.

211
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:21,931
And when he makes his move.

212
00:11:21,973 --> 00:11:24,601
I'll strike him from
Nakashima Fortress.

213
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:25,560
One thing,

214
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:28,605
that fortress is clearly
visible from the ridgeline.

215
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:31,316
The enemy would realize
your strategy right away.

216
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:34,611
That's exactly
what my intention is.

217
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,034
[NOBUNAGA] Why do you
suppose Imagawa Yoshimoto,

218
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:42,076
the head commander,

219
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:44,662
is coming all the way out
to Owari in person?

220
00:11:46,581 --> 00:11:48,541
Because he's rapacious.

221
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:50,835
He wants to see
with his own eyes.

222

To be present when a
great army under his command

223
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:56,216
stomps us out like insects.

224
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:58,092
So we'll lure him out.

225
00:11:58,134 --> 00:11:59,052
While he's distracted,

226
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:01,054
watching for the moment
when I'm taken down.

227
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:03,473
We'll attack all at once!

228
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:06,726
If we pull it off, then we
might be able to defeat him.

229
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:07,644
There's no "might."

I'd only get in the way?

I need you to keep Mino

from thinking they have
the chance to attack.

256

We'd have our backs exposed.

257
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:14,919
And thus wouldn't be
able to fight Imagawa

knowing they
were left unchecked.

[KICHOU]
At this juncture,

261
00:13:21,843 --> 00:13:25,555
Nobunaga‐ <i>sama</i> was confident
with his odds of winning.

262
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:28,599
That is... until Oda

crossing Kutsukake Pass.

Are you certain
this isn't some mistake?

It's confirmed.

267
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,780
Nearly all of Suruga's army
has been directed this way.

268
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:46,701
Also, there's Mikawa's troops,
they've joined with them.

269
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:49,162
That's 20 times the
number of our troops.

270
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:51,873
We're unable to contend
with that many.

for a peace offering.

We'll wait until they're
overextended, then strike.

00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:02,759
That's the plan.

276
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,095
As their numbers increase, their
movements will grow sluggish,

277
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:08,056

323
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:33,826
[KICHOU]
Nowhere to be found.

324
00:16:33,868 --> 00:16:35,286
What?

325
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:38,706
Whatever's going on, I can't
help but feel apprehensive.

326
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:40,583
What if he's planning
to offer his own head,

327
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:43,336
killing himself so Imagawa
will end this war?

328
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:45,922
Honestly, I was worried
about the same thing.

329
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:49,592
However excellent the strategy
is, we're so outmatched

330
00:16:49,634 --> 00:16:52,762
damage to our own side
will be catastrophic.

331
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:56,891
Offering up his own life, so his
companions won't die needlessly.

332
00:16:56,933 --> 00:17:00,436
That's just the sort of proposal
he would come up with.

333
00:17:00,478 --> 00:17:01,479
Let's go!

334
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:02,855
We have to stop him!

335
00:17:02,897 --> 00:17:05,858
Then I take it you know where
we can find Nobunaga‐<i>sama</i>?

336
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,652
Of course!

337
00:17:10,488 --> 00:17:11,405
Tsuneoki‐<i>dono</i>!

338
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:13,282
Why are you dawdling around?

339
00:17:13,324 --> 00:17:15,743
Don't you realize
your lord has already set out!

340
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:17,036
Sound the horns!

341
00:17:17,078 --> 00:17:18,746
Huh? You heard him!

342
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:20,581
Let's get moving!

343
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,337
Ride!

344
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:38,808
Reporting, sir!

345
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:39,892
Maeda Toshiie.

346
00:17:39,934 --> 00:17:42,353
Hastening to your side,
as promised!

347
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:46,899
I swear upon my name, as long
as I breathe, I will serve you.

348
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:51,612
Um, what's with
that outfit, my lord?

349
00:17:51,654 --> 00:17:52,572
This is‐‐

350
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:53,364
I get it!

351
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:54,865
You're praying for victory!

352
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:56,701
Let me join you!

353
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:57,410
Listen to me.

354
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:59,787
Go back home to Kiyosu!

355
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:00,955
Go home?

356
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:03,791
Are you saying you don't
require my services?

357
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:04,417
You can't.

358
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:07,461
I want to fight on your behalf,
Nobunaga‐ <i>sama</i> !

359
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:09,255
Toshiie.

360
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:15,177
That smoke cloud, it's either
from Marune or Washizu.

361
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:18,598
I'm positive the men fighting
there feel the same as I do!

362
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:23,561
[TSUNEOKI]
Nobunaga‐<i>sama</i>!

363
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:27,356
Tsuneoki!

364
00:18:27,398 --> 00:18:28,608
Yes.

365
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:30,818
I've come to accompany you.

366
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:34,864
My lord, did you really think
you could leave me behind?

367
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:35,948
[gasps]

368
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:39,327
[TSUNEOKI] I've spent more
than 20 years in your service.

369
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:42,204
Back when you were flamboyant.

370
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:44,790
When you bought all
the foreign goods you could.

371
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:45,708
And when you took someone

372
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:49,629
with an extraordinary
secret past as your wife.

373
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:53,424
Over the years, you've made
me suffer numerous hardships,

374
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:55,968
but this one is the worst.

375
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:57,094
Hold on.

376
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,305
[TSUNEOKI] Those men
who are clashing blades

377
00:18:59,347 --> 00:19:01,974
at this very moment,
have faith in you.

378
00:19:04,018 --> 00:19:06,145
They believe you'll build
a new world because

379
00:19:06,187 --> 00:19:10,191
you've never been trapped
by the old order of thought.

380
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:12,526
They want to see that vista.

381
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:14,195
With their own eyes.

382
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:20,034
If you want to keep all their
hopes from falling into ruin,

383
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:22,161
then fight, Nobunaga!

384
00:19:22,203 --> 00:19:23,829
[gasps]

385
00:19:25,206 --> 00:19:27,208
Please, fight.

386
00:19:28,918 --> 00:19:30,252
[sighs]

387
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:33,005
Tsuneoki, you saved me.

388
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:36,050
I was on the verge of being
pretentious and scatter‐brained.

389
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:41,055
[NOBUNAGA]
But it's still over.

390
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:42,223
In short,

391
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:46,102
I sent Takugen Oshou as a
messenger to broker for peace.

392
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:49,188
We'll stop him immediately.

393
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:50,564
[TAKUGEN]
Have you three finished talking?

394
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:52,441
Huh?

395
00:19:52,483 --> 00:19:54,276
Takugen!

396
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:56,487
[TAKUGEN] I suspected events
would play out this way,

397
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:58,447
so I paused for a bit.

398
00:19:58,489 --> 00:20:00,533
And the letter I gave
you to pass along?

399
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:04,161
Forgive me, but I never had
any intention of delivering it.

400
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:07,456
You see, I do
dislike losing wagers.

401
00:20:15,673 --> 00:20:17,633
[KATSUIE]
Nobunaga‐<i>sama</i>!

402
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:27,226
As retainers of the Oda clan,

403
00:20:27,268 --> 00:20:31,230
we will accompany you
wherever you choose to go.

404
00:20:31,272 --> 00:20:32,106
All of us will.

405
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:33,774
So, whaddaya say?

406
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:39,864
Will somebody
please bring me food?

407
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,615
I haven't eaten
since last night,

408
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:45,494
since I thought I'd be
cutting open my stomach.

409
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:47,163
My Lord.

410
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:52,376
A swallow!

411
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:56,630
Somehow,
I suspect it'll rain soon.

412
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:58,591
With the heavens as our allies,

413
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:00,926
there's no doubt
as to our victory!

414
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:02,303
[NOBUNAGA ARMY]
Yes, sir!

415
00:21:05,848 --> 00:21:06,891
[IMAGAWA RETAINER A]
Imagawa‐<i>sama</i>.

416
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:07,600
We've received word

417
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:10,770
that both Washizu and Marune
Fortresses have fallen.

418
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:11,937
[IMAGAWA]
Hmm...

419
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:14,899
It looks like rain.

420
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,233
Fine.

421
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:17,693
We'll rest a while.

422
00:21:17,735 --> 00:21:18,611
Sir!

423
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:20,404
Prepare the camp!

424
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:28,454
[NOBUNAGA] Listen carefully
and heed my words!

425
00:21:28,496 --> 00:21:30,206
Luck is for Heaven to decide!

426
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:32,208
If they charge, retreat.

427
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:34,919
If they fall back,
press forward!

428
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,462
And if we're victorious.

429
00:21:36,504 --> 00:21:39,590
History will remember those
of you who fought here today!

430
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:43,010
I swear, your names will
echo through eternity!

431
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:46,013
Ride with me!

432
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:01,737
Don't let these
little fish distract you!

433
00:22:01,779 --> 00:22:05,282
Our target is the head
of Imagawa Yoshimoto!

434
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,369
[KICHOU]
Thus, on that day,

435
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:10,496
during the battle at Okehazama,

436
00:22:10,538 --> 00:22:14,416
Nobunaga‐ <i>sama</i>
killed Imagawa Yoshimoto.

437
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:17,336
Just over ten years
after his first battle,

438
00:22:17,378 --> 00:22:19,463
hemmed in by powerful realms,

439
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:22,842
and amidst endless strife
within his own land and home,

440
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:26,470
he fought with champions
at his side and survived.

441
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:30,683
This occurred in the spring
after his 27th birthday.
