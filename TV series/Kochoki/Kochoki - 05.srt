1
00:00:20,604 --> 00:00:23,273
[YOSHITATSU]
You mean to invite Nobunaga?

2
00:00:23,315 --> 00:00:24,358
That's right.

3
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:26,693
He did manage
to win Kichou over.

4
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:30,697
Having him in our pocket
could prove valuable.

5
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:32,866
Not to mention,
it's paramount we keep Imagawa

6
00:00:32,908 --> 00:00:35,410
from believing he has
any real influence.

7
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:36,328
Nobunaga turned against

8
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:39,164
even his own clan's
Principal Line in Kiyosu.

9
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:41,959
Making him an ally
won't be an easy task.

10
00:00:41,959 --> 00:00:43,252
There's talk.

11
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:45,796
They say he's a flake,
obsessed with foreigners.

12
00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:49,174
The fact is, he might
drag us into war instead.

13
00:00:49,216 --> 00:00:50,842
[DOUSAN]
Hmph!

14
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:55,973
If he proves to be more
trouble than he's worth,

15
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:57,516
we can do away with him.

16
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:38,950
Not bad.

17
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:41,119
You've improved, Toshiie.

18
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:42,579
Just watch.

19
00:02:42,621 --> 00:02:44,831
Soon I'll achieve
something great.

20
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:46,667
[ATTENDANT A]
Nobunaga‐<i>sama</i>!

21
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:49,336
A message has arrived
from Saitou Dousan‐<i>dono</i>!

22
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,756
[TAKUGEN]
A meeting?

23
00:02:52,798 --> 00:02:54,841
I think it's a good idea.

24
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:56,593
Establishing ties
with the Saitou clan

25
00:02:56,635 --> 00:02:58,637
would strengthen
Owari's footing.

26
00:02:58,679 --> 00:02:59,680
Agreed.

27
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:01,765
And it'd silence those
in Suemori Castle

28
00:03:01,807 --> 00:03:04,643
who're pushing for
Nobukatsu to rule.

29
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:06,144
You're both right.

30
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:07,813
I figured
"The Viper" of Mino and I

31
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,523
would eventually
have to meet.

32
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:11,566
Wait. The Viper?

33
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:15,153
[sighs]

34
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,280
It's a metaphor, nothing more.

35
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:19,866
When he was younger, he spied a
momentary opening and struck,

36
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:22,077
seizing power,
and thus, the name.

37
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:24,663
But, how is that
any less terrifying?

38
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:27,582
What will you do, my lord?

39
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:29,209
We'll meet.

40
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:33,755
[KICHOU] You want
to know about my father?

41
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:34,965
What's he like?

42
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:37,217
Describe him to me.

43
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:38,552
The truth is,

44
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:40,804
I don't really know
who he is either.

45
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:41,930
We were distant.

46
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:42,848
Starting at a young age,

47
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:45,851
I was brought up and
trained in the ninja village.

48
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:47,602
A ninja village?

49
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:48,562
[KICHOU]
Yes.

50
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:49,396
We trained hard.

51
00:03:49,438 --> 00:03:51,022
Day and night.

52
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:55,193
[KICHOU]
From the very beginning,

53
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:58,071
we were taught
we had only one duty:

54
00:03:58,113 --> 00:04:01,908
To carry out tasks
for our master.

55
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:04,411
Do you remember Kaede, my lord?

56
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:06,288
We were always together.

57
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:08,123
Like sisters.

58
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:15,922
[KICHOU] Then one day, I was
ordered to Inabayama Castle

59
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:18,633
and told to put all my
effort into my role there.

60
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:19,760
I'd been certain I was preparing

61
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:23,555
to serve beside
Kaede, as a ninja.

62
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:27,601
Why am I the only one
being fitted for clothes?

63
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:31,480
[KAEDE] Because, you're our
father's actual daughter.

64
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:35,734
[KICHOU] All the ninja referred
to Dousan‐<i>sama</i> as "Father"

65
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:38,361
to maximize their loyalty.

66
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:43,325
But I never imagined I was
actually related by blood.

67
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:45,827
I was nothing more
than one of his pawns.

68
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:48,622
A tool to be used
at his discretion.

69
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:50,707
So that was your upbringing.

70
00:04:50,749 --> 00:04:52,417
Why is the world so cruel?

71
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:54,586
Because it's at war, my lord.

72
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:57,506
I believe everything
that happened led me here.

73
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:59,591
To be with you.

74
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:02,010
[NOBUNAGA]
I believe so too.

75
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:15,148
[KICHOU]
I'd like one dango, sir.

76
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,650
[VENDOR]
Sure thing.

77
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:25,367
It's been a while, Kaede.

78
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:27,869
You're different from
the last time we met.

79
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:30,163
I hardly recognize you.

80
00:05:30,205 --> 00:05:31,498
What do you want?

81
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:34,125
About this meeting
that's coming up.

82
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,544
Depending on its outcome,

83
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:39,589
you and Nobunaga may
be targeted for execution.

84
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:46,054
[KAEDE] Walk away now and
you can rejoin the Saitou clan.

85
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:50,934
I appreciate the warning, but I
have no intention of returning.

86
00:05:50,976 --> 00:05:55,063
I'm no longer the person I was,
and for better or for worse,

87
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:57,649
my life's bound to my lord.

88
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:58,942
[KAEDE]
Is that so?

89
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:01,111
What a shame.

90
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:02,153
[sighs]

91
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:04,573
There's only one
thing left to say.

92
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:05,615
You're right.

93
00:06:05,657 --> 00:06:09,578
You are a different person
than you used to be.

94
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:13,373
And the person you are now
won't be able to protect him.

95
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:21,256
That was a nice snack.

96
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:30,807
[KICHOU] I haven't
stopped training, and yet...

97
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:42,944
[KICHOU pants]

98
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:45,655
...Nobunaga‐<i>sama</i>'s
kindness has left me soft.

99
00:06:45,697 --> 00:06:48,867
I need to regain
my sixth sense fast.

100
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:53,163
[KICHOU] Shortly thereafter, a
letter was delivered from Mino.

101
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:55,248
It included details about
the upcoming meeting

102
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:56,666
between the leaders.

103
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:02,547
[TSUNEOKI] The location
will be Shoutoku Temple.

104
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:05,300
The exact midpoint
between Owari and Mino.

105
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:07,218
Well, naturally we'll prepare
an armed contingent

106
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,554
in secret to be there too.

107
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:11,765
The other side will
likely do the same.

108
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:13,600
Makes you wish we had
a little more information

109
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:16,603
before going, huh?

110
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:19,689
Too bad we don't have anything

111
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:23,109
that could give us
a strategic advantage.

112
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:24,986
Like a sketch
of Shoutoku Temple!

113
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:26,154
[ALL]
Ohhh!

114
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:28,657
[TOSHIIE] I snuck in and
scouted the area for a bit.

115
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:29,616
[NOBUNAGA]
What's the matter with you,

116
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:32,327
taking a risk like that?

117
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:34,704
Still, I gotta say, good job.

118
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:41,461
Stage one is for me, Tsuneoki,
and Kichou to enter the temple.

119
00:07:41,503 --> 00:07:44,381
The troops will keep their
distance and stand by here.

120
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:46,675
The commanding
officer will be...

121
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:48,802
Toshiie, you're in charge.

122
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:51,012
Are you positive, my lord?

123
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:53,807
Overseeing five to six hundred
troops won't be easy.

124
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:54,599
But then again,

125
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:57,435
you said you wanted to
accomplish something great.

126
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:58,770
Right!

127
00:07:58,812 --> 00:07:59,479
Just watch!

128
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:01,314
You won't regret this, my lord!

129
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,528
[NOBUNAGA]
Hmm? What's this?

130
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:07,487
[TSUNEOKI]
Oh.

131
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:10,031
A female servant
left that earlier.

132
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:11,658
She said a peasant
child returned it

133
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,785
or something to that effect.

134
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:17,956
[SHOPKEEPER]
Come on over!

135
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:19,332
[NOBUNAGA chuckles]
Visiting the market

136
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:21,668
always revitalizes me.

137
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:24,087
The hustle and bustle of
people coming and going.

138
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:26,297
The energy and
enthusiasm in the air.

139
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,591
Samurai are so
fiercely territorial.

140
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:31,761
But merchants can go anywhere
and rely on resourcefulness.

141
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:33,596
They're truly free.

142
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:35,598
Just what's so important
about this book?

143
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,726
I gave it to someone.

144
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:39,978
A child who was here previously.

145
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:44,816
[NOBUNAGA] I could see
the kid wanted to learn.

146
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:49,070
[NOBUNAGA]
Thought you'd be here.

147
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:51,740
Huh?

148
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:54,034
Why'd you come
all the way to return this?

149
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:55,660
[GOSHICHI]
Nobunaga‐<i>sama</i>!

150
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,247
I didn't want it anymore!

151
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:00,999
Too difficult to follow?

152
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,709
That wasn't the reason!

153
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:05,920
All thanks to the war
you insisted on starting,

154
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,797
my village is gone.

155
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,966
It was burnt to the ground!

156
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:13,261
[GOSHICHI] Mother says since
we're living through a war,

157
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:14,971
it can't be helped.

158
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:19,225
But that doesn't make
any of the pain go away.

159
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:22,312
I won't accept charity
from the man responsible!

160
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:25,106
So take your book
and go back to your castle!

161
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,945
I'm sor‐‐

162
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:40,622
[YOSHITATSU]
Good!

163
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:42,123
That is all!

164
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:48,338
[SAITOU RETAINER A]
His grandson Shirou‐<i>dono</i>

165
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:50,006
along with Kiheiji‐<i>dono</i>.

166
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:51,091
[YOSHITATSU]
Those two.

167
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:55,929
Coming to inquire about
Father's health again, no doubt.

168
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,680
Do they really
think their visits

169
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:02,060
will earn them my
spot as successor?

170
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:03,978
However, on the
off‐chance Father takes

171
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,940
to Nobunaga instead.

172
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:09,526
[OHANA]
I can't take my eyes off of it!

173
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:12,112
What a beguiling kimono!

174
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:12,987
[KICHOU]
Indeed.

175
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:15,990
My elder brother
sent it as a gift.

176
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:18,034
[YOSHITATSU]
It's been so long.

177
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:21,788
I look forward to
seeing you again, sister.

178
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:24,999
[KICHOU] This is out
of character for him.

179
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,751
So, a peacock, huh?

180
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:28,962
I couldn't have chosen better.

181
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:31,840
That thing is called
a peacock, my lord?

182
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:32,924
That's right.

183
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:34,134
According to legend,

184
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:36,302
the bird is able to keep
away people's suffering

185
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:37,887
and bring them happiness.

186
00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:39,722
[KICHOU]
Is it that so?

187
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:41,224
What a great omen!

188
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:43,726
And right before the
upcoming get‐together too!

189
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:46,604
[laughs]

190
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,064
[KICHOU]
It's beautiful.

191
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:49,357
And yet,

192
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:53,403
I can't help but sense
something sinister behind it.

193
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:01,828
Right.

194
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:04,914
Something wrong?

195
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:10,587
While I understand trying to
regain your ninja sixth sense,

196
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:13,339
there's no need
to push yourself so hard.

197
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:15,758
This is the one duty
I'm able to perform.

198
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,011
Guarding Nobunaga‐<i>sama</i>.

199
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:19,053
You see.

200
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:20,346
I have to keep you safe.

201
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:23,600
Otherwise, there'd
be no point in living.

202
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:25,518
[NOBUNAGA]
No point in living?

203
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:27,520
Kichou.

204
00:11:27,562 --> 00:11:29,606
Even though you left
your former life behind,

205
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:31,983
it's still controlling you.

206
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:33,318
I'm not your master,

207
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:36,279
and I don't want you to
sacrifice your life for me.

208
00:11:38,573 --> 00:11:40,366
[NOBUNAGA]
As for a reason to live,

209
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:43,870
can't this tenderness be enough?

210
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:46,372
[KICHOU]
Nobunaga‐<i>sama</i>.

211
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:47,498
[NOBUNAGA]
Kichou.

212
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,500
Stay by my side.

213
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,377
The only thing
I want to believe in

214
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:53,463
is what we're sharing right now.

215
00:11:58,092 --> 00:12:00,595
[NOBUNAGA] We'll proceed
to the temple ahead of you.

216
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:02,805
I leave the rest up
to you, Toshiie.

217
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:05,683
When you feel the timing is
right, close in with the troops.

218
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:07,018
[TOSHIIE]
Yes, sir!

219
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:11,022
My father has
already left the castle.

220
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:13,107
I will follow him soon.

221
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:15,610
Inaba, you have the command.

222
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:17,070
Understood.

223
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:20,740
[SAITOU RETAINER B] My lord,
if you don't mind me asking,

224
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:23,243
what is it you've been
doing here all this time?

225
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:24,869
Heh. I want to get a glimpse

226
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:28,539
of the esteemed Oda Nobunaga's
face ahead of our meeting.

227
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,124
I've heard he's
a scatterbrained fool,

228
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,585
but I wanted to
judge for myself.

229
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:37,590
You can't make me!

230
00:12:37,632 --> 00:12:39,759
My lord, this is
absolute madness!

231
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:42,136
You're behavior's unacceptable!

232
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:48,268
[NOBUNAGA] And as your lord,
I'm telling you I don't care!

233
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,645
The rumors were wrong.

234
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:53,147
He's worse.

235
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:55,483
The boy belongs in a cage!

236
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:58,611
I regret instigating this
meeting in the first place.

237
00:12:58,653 --> 00:13:00,446
Has everything been prepared?

238
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:01,781
Yes.

239
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:05,285
[SERVANT] Oda Kazusa no Suke
Nobunaga‐<i>sama</i> has arrived!

240
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:26,306
I am Oda Nobunaga.

241
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:28,891
And I am called Saitou Dousan.

242
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:31,853
Shall we first partake
of some refreshments?

243
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:42,071
[DOUSAN]
It's hard to believe

244
00:13:42,113 --> 00:13:44,824
this is the same man
I observed earlier.

245
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:47,493
[YOSHITATSU]
He's utterly bizarre.

246
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:49,746
[NOBUNAGA] Ugh.
My face feels stretched out.

247
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:52,415
I really hate this hairstyle.

248
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:54,709
[TSUNEOKI]
That look suits him.

249
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:00,548
[DOUSAN] Despite being
from two separate clans,

250
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:02,425
we share similar goals.

251
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:03,718
If we were to join our forces,

252
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,220
they could be more
easily achieved.

253
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:08,973
[NOBUNAGA]
I couldn't have said it better.

254
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:13,227
Ikeda‐<i>dono</i>.

255
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:16,439
The temple's been completely
surrounded by their troops.

256
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:17,523
I see.

257
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:21,027
The Saitou forces are
moving just as we expected.

258
00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:23,863
Toshiie should have
already arrived by now.

259
00:14:23,905 --> 00:14:25,782
What's keeping him?

260
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:32,038
We should have been able to pass
this stream without a problem.

261
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,916
It's because of the
rainstorms we've had.

262
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:37,293
What do you think we
should do, Maeda‐<i>dono</i>?

263
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:40,630
[TOSHIIE]
Good question.

264
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:43,633
I'm supposed to be in charge
and I don't have a clue.

265
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:46,260
[TOSHIIE]
Come on.

266
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:48,471
There's no time for indecision.

267
00:14:48,513 --> 00:14:49,764
Right. Listen up!

268
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:52,725
We can't cross here, so we'll
have to find another way.

269
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:53,684
Hurry!

270
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:56,938
We can't waste any time getting
to Nobunaga‐<i>sama</i>'s side!

271
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:58,523
[DOUSAN]
I've heard you have

272
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:02,110
some rather eclectic tastes,
Nobunaga‐<i>dono</i>.

273
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:04,445
So, I've had something
prepared especially for you

274
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:07,573
that's quite rare
as well as appetizing.

275
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:09,409
[NOBUNAGA]
And what would these be?

276
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:10,952
[DOUSAN]
They're frogs.

277
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:12,412
[NOBUNAGA]
Really?

278
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:15,790
[NOBUNAGA]
Delicious!

279
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:18,459
[YOSHITATSU]
Please.

280
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:19,752
There's no need
to force yourself

281
00:15:19,794 --> 00:15:21,629
for the sake of manners!

282
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:23,881
I've eaten these at
the marketplace before!

283
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:24,715
While I've always loved them,

284
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:28,886
the added spice really
enhances the flavor!

285
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,389
Oh... I must confess,

286
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:33,891
I'm a bit surprised someone
from an exalted lineage

287
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:36,686
such as yourself can appreciate
how delicious they can be

288
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:38,396
when cooked right.

289
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:40,690
I was no stranger
to them as a child.

290
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:42,859
Given my destitute background,

291
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,319
I made my way through the
world by not being particular

292
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:48,865
about what it took
in order to survive.

293
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:50,992
Naturally,
this included killing.

294
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:53,786
Which I've done countless
times, along the way.

295
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:55,037
[NOBUNAGA]
You don't say.

296
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:57,039
Tell me more about
these experiences.

297
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:58,499
I mean, you must
know a great deal

298
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:00,376
about markets and traveling.

299
00:16:00,418 --> 00:16:01,669
[DOUSAN]
Markets?

300
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:03,880
Yes, I've seen quite a few.

301
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:05,214
I admire how merchants are free

302
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:07,133
and not constrained
by any rules.

303
00:16:07,175 --> 00:16:08,968
Apparently, some
are constantly moving,

304
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:12,305
journeying from market‐to‐market
and amassing enormous riches.

305
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:16,267
While that's true, some
have exploited that freedom.

306
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:18,936
I've heard of cases where
powerful merchants form cabals

307
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,189
and hike up costs knowing
the people have to pay

308
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,399
whatever price they set.

309
00:16:23,441 --> 00:16:27,111
Perhaps a written law is needed
to prevent this from happening.

310
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:28,404
What would you say
about collaborating

311
00:16:28,446 --> 00:16:30,072
on that in the near future?

312
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:31,032
[DOUSAN]
Hmm?

313
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:32,492
A law?

314
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:33,701
I'd be interested.

315
00:16:33,743 --> 00:16:36,412
Having trade flourish will be
a key element of governance

316
00:16:36,454 --> 00:16:38,247
in days to come.

317
00:16:38,289 --> 00:16:42,418
Perhaps more essential than
disagreements over territory.

318
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,337
[YOSHITATSU] I don't like
where this is headed.

319
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:47,548
He can't be allowed to
get on Father's good side.

320
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:49,675
Time to act.

321
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:51,093
By the way,

322
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:53,346
I hope Kichou‐<i>dono</i>
is in good health.

323
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:56,349
[NOBUNAGA]
Huh? Yes. Thank you for asking.

324
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,851
Is it about time
I called her in?

325
00:16:58,893 --> 00:17:00,186
Please, can you fetch her.

326
00:17:00,228 --> 00:17:01,521
Yes.

327
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,564
[KICHOU]
Hello, Father.

328
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:05,733
It's been some time.

329
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:09,028
[gasps]

330
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:11,113
Is that you?

331
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:14,283
You've changed so much.

332
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:16,327
You haven't changed one bit.

333
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:17,453
How dare you!

334
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:19,747
Wearing a peacock robe
in front of Father!

335
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:22,542
I've never seen such
an insulting display!

336
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:26,462
It's said the peacock takes
away people's suffering.

337
00:17:26,504 --> 00:17:28,089
Surely you knew
that belief originated

338
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:30,049
because the animal
eats repulsive things,

339
00:17:30,091 --> 00:17:31,717
including venomous snakes!

340
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:33,928
[KICHOU]
No, I meant no disrespect!

341
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:35,888
Besides, this kimono was your...

342
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:37,265
[YOSHITATSU]
I heard Nobunaga‐<i>sama</i>

343
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:40,184
was knowledgeable
concerning all things foreign.

344
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:42,853
It's impossible that the
symbolism was lost on him,

345
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:46,315
and therefore this can only be
seen an insult towards Father!

346
00:17:46,357 --> 00:17:49,652
[DOUSAN] As if I'm not aware
you're behind this, Yoshitatsu.

347
00:17:49,694 --> 00:17:51,821
That much is obvious.

348
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:54,615
Though I am curious how
Nobunaga and Kichou plan

349
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:57,159
on riding this out.

350
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:00,121
If you would take a closer look.

351
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:01,664
Kichou.

352
00:18:05,126 --> 00:18:05,751
As you can see,

353
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:08,671
the peacock is bowing
its head to Dousan‐ <i>dono</i> .

354
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:11,882
[NOBUNAGA]
It's an appropriate metaphor.

355
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,676
You've managed to humble
a natural enemy,

356
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:16,095
all in an instant!

357
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:17,638
That's how you respond

358
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:21,058
when you know the
wrong answer could kill you?

359
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:25,563
[DOUSAN laughs]

360
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:27,940
You're a father to me,
Dousan‐<i>dono</i>.

361
00:18:27,982 --> 00:18:29,817
And a child
killing their father,

362
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:32,069
the thought is unimaginable.

363
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,864
As is the reverse.

364
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:36,574
But still, I wonder.

365
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:38,909
After all, our world is at war.

366
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:42,121
Children and parents can
still be friends or foes.

367
00:18:42,163 --> 00:18:44,081
[NOBUNAGA] Then can you
say with absolute certainty

368
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,750
when the bloodshed's over,

369
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:48,085
you won't have
the slightest regret?

370
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,128
[DOUSAN]
Hmph.

371
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:50,129
Your mistake is assuming

372
00:18:50,171 --> 00:18:52,923
there will be a simple
conclusion to these conflicts.

373
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:54,258
You're wrong.

374
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:57,511
Someday it will end.

375
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:59,930
[DOUSAN] And how do you
believe this will happen?

376
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,390
That's a good question.

377
00:19:01,432 --> 00:19:04,310
The only answer
I can give is this.

378
00:19:04,352 --> 00:19:06,270
A leader.

379
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:09,565
What we need is somebody who'd
be able to wield immense power.

380
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:12,860
The power to finally
restore order to the world.

381
00:19:12,902 --> 00:19:13,819
[DOUSAN laughs]

382
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:17,198
And just what mortal do you
think could accomplish this?

383
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:19,742
[gasps]

384
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:24,372
[DOUSAN]
This man, is he sane?

385
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:27,458
[NOBUNAGA] What I want
is to transform the world

386
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,502
and give people a sense of hope.

387
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:32,672
[YOSHITATSU]
He's delusional.

388
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:35,424
I despise everything
about this man.

389
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:43,099
[KICHOU]
Father.

390
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:47,186
Now that we've cleared the air,
even the peacock is overjoyed.

391
00:19:47,228 --> 00:19:50,606
If it pleases you,
I'd like to perform a dance.

392
00:20:27,435 --> 00:20:28,144
Emerge!

393
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:29,812
We're under attack!

394
00:20:48,998 --> 00:20:50,833
What on earth was that?

395
00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:01,010
Forgive me, my lord.

396
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:02,386
I've kept you waiting.

397
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:03,637
Huh?

398
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,348
Actually, you're right on time.

399
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,729
It looks like the bowman
is one of the retainers

400
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:13,814
for the Saitou clan.

401
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,985
They have so many muskets.

402
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:22,072
[laughs]

403
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:24,074
I admit my defeat.

404
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:25,785
Only one thing remains.

405
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:29,163
How can I ever atone
for my rude behavior?

406
00:21:33,501 --> 00:21:36,212
No atonement is necessary.

407
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:40,925
Let us unite and work together,
to protect both Mino and Owari.

408
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:44,136
That, I can agree to.

409
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:47,348
[KICHOU]
On that day,

410
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:50,601
Nobunaga‐<i>sama</i> pardoned
the Saitou clan's misdeeds,

411
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:54,021
and agreed to join together
with them in cooperation.

412
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:03,823
Now I understand why Kichou
sees so much promise in him.

413
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:05,950
Mark my words,
there will be a time

414
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:11,080
when a great number of people
bow down before that man.

415
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:13,499
Oda Nobunaga.
