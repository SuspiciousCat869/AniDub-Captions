00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,735
Maintain focus!

00:00:26,777 --> 00:00:27,861
Concentrate

3
00:00:27,903 --> 00:00:29,905
Yes, you're right.

4
00:00:30,906 --> 00:00:32,908
[KATSUIE] The arrow will
invariably find its target

5
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:34,451
if your perception
remains unclouded,

6
00:00:34,493 --> 00:00:36,912
as clear as a mirror,
still as water!

7
00:00:36,954 --> 00:00:39,831
I think I've found the
source of my distraction.

8
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:40,624
It's you.

9
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:42,292
[KATSUIE sighs]
Sorry.

10
00:00:47,089 --> 00:00:48,590
[ATTENDANT A]
Hey, it went that way!

11
00:00:48,632 --> 00:00:50,133
I see it!

12
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:53,387
[NOBUKATSU]
What is going on over there?

13
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:55,430
Sorry! The bird got
loose somehow!

14
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:57,057
Bird?

15
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,728
[ATTENDANT B] Quick! Hold
it down before it gets away!

16
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,355
[ATTENDANT A]
It's heading right for you!

17
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:04,773
[gasps]

18
00:01:04,815 --> 00:01:06,358
[ATTENDANT B]
Who is that guy?

19
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:12,781
Are you injured, my lord?

20
00:01:12,823 --> 00:01:14,741
Um, no.

21
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:16,618
Thank you.

22
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:20,038
May I please know the name
of the man who saved me?

23
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,999
Kurando.

24
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,335
You may call me Tsuzuki Kurando.

25
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:28,005
[KICHOU]
Oda Nobunaga.

26
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:32,092
When the world was at war,
he eclipsed it like a demon god.

27
00:01:32,134 --> 00:01:34,094
Though much has
been written about him,

28
00:01:34,136 --> 00:01:36,680
the man I knew
differed from the legend.

29
00:01:36,722 --> 00:01:39,141
Tonight, let me tell you
a bit more about

30
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:42,394
who that Nobunaga‐<i>sama</i>
really was.

31
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:21,993
[NOBUNAGA] Apparently it
got sent to Nobukatsu's place

32
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:25,747
instead of being
delivered here.

33
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:28,667
As noted in this
letter of complaint.

34
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:29,918
Back up one moment.

35
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,962
What is this
mystifying creature?

36
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:35,173
Furthermore, why was it
supposed to be delivered here?

37
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:36,550
If I'm being completely honest,

38
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:40,554
it wasn't my
first choice for a pet.

39
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:43,098
I couldn't get
my hands on a peacock,

40
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,851
but you can have
this creature instead!

41
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:49,062
You could have told him no.

42
00:03:49,104 --> 00:03:52,023
It's a rare species.

43
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:54,901
Whatever it is,
it won't stop staring.

44
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:59,072
I'm wondering, what sort
of bird is this anyway?

45
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:00,407
Something like...

46
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:02,117
It's an ostrich!

47
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:04,578
Well, I know it's male.

48
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:07,372
It's a real shame it won't
be able to lay any eggs.

49
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:09,040
No chicks, unfortunately.

50
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,500
Are you disappointed?

51
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:11,418
Actually,

52
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,336
I was just thinking about
how many rolled omelets

53
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:15,464
we could have made!

54
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,802
[NOBUNAGA] I understand
being annoyed with the mix up,

55
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:24,181
but Nobukatsu should've come
here and complained directly.

56
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:27,225
That's not feasible
given his new position

57
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:31,396
as master of Suemori Castle.

58
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:33,607
He can't get away as easily now.

59
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:36,902
Well, You would think he could
make an exception in my case.

60
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:39,029
We are brothers.

61
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,322
Yeah, but...

62
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:41,948
...the only reason
I can think for him to visit

63
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,618
would be a special circumstance.

64
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:47,078
So you're saying
I'm not special enough.

65
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,830
[TOSHIIE]
Nobunaga‐<i>sama</i>!

66
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:51,416
Preparations for
making mochi are done!

67
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,668
Wait. I have an idea!

68
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,003
[NOBUMORI]
A New Year's Party?

69
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:55,879
You betcha!

70
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:58,340
Nobunaga‐<i>sama</i>'s family
will all gather together

71
00:04:58,381 --> 00:04:59,257
in Nagoya Castle

72
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,259
in order to celebrate
the New Year!

73
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,595
And they're going
to have some company.

74
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:06,264
Can you believe we received
permission to join them?

75
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,391
It's amazing, right?

76
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:11,561
Ah. Though I was planning
a solitary wilderness retreat

77
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:13,647
to work on improving
my swordsmanship.

78
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:15,398
Enough with the austerities.

79
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,566
We ought to attend.

80
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:19,820
Not like any of us have a home
to go to for New Year's anyway.

81
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:22,614
One thing is for sure,
I'm definitely showing up.

82
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:24,407
I mean, we can
probably down sakÃ©

83
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:26,993
to our heart's content so...

84
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:29,037
Perhaps you should get
your appetite in check,

85
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:31,665
or we won't have
any food left to go with it.

86
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:33,708
Oh, there's one
more proclamation.

87
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,585
If you're joining in
the celebrations,

88
00:05:35,627 --> 00:05:37,921
then each of you has to
perform some sort of talent

89
00:05:37,963 --> 00:05:39,089
for the guests!

00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:40,465

[TSUNEOKI]
I must say, not a bad idea.

105
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,034
It'd be difficult for anyone

00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:10,579
to turn down a New

What's this about
a banquet, my lord?

110
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,922
[NOBUKATSU] He says that
we have much to discuss,

111
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:24,426
and we should all get together
when New Year's arrives.

[GOZEN]
You mustn't.

[NOBUKATSU]
Mother!

114
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,974
Nobunaga's actions
have created a rift

115
00:06:31,016 --> 00:06:34,060
with the Principal
Line in Kiyosu.

116
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:35,520
If we're seen in his company,

117
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:39,232
it's inevitable we'd come
under their scrutiny as well.

118
00:06:39,274 --> 00:06:42,068
[NOBUKATSU]
There's no need to worry.

119
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,486
It'll be fine.

120
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:45,363
Nobukatsu!

121
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:50,368
[KICHOU]
However.

122
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:54,539
The New Year came,
but no banquet was held.

123
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:56,625
This was because
Imagawa Yoshimoto,

124
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:59,085
who had been eyeing
Owari with a hungry stare,

125
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:01,004
began constructing
a fort at Muraki,

126
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:03,882
near the neck of
the Chita Peninsula.

127
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:05,300
If this keeps up.

128
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:09,262
Mizuno‐<i>dono</i> will be defeated
and Ogawa Castle will fall.

129
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:10,680
We'll send them aid.

130
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:13,350
My lord, if we leave the castle,

131
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:15,226
the Principal Line
will seize the opportunity

132
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,145
and claim it as their own.

133
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:21,316
I know, but we don't have enough
troops to divide our forces.

134
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:25,195
[KICHOU] Why don't you
ask my father to help?

135
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:26,988
Dousan‐<i>dono</i>?

136
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:31,242
While you travel to Ogawa,
he could defend Nagoya for you.

137
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:32,702
Let's go with that!

138
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:34,120
He did what?

139
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:36,581
How dare he allow
Mino's troops into Nagoya!

140
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:38,333
He's a complete fool.

141
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:40,669
Trusting the castle
to a former enemy!

142
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,879
There's simply
nothing more to discuss.

143
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:45,090
I say we wash our hands of him.

144
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:47,050
So it's finally come to this.

145

[TSUNEOKI]
What now, my lord?

There's no choice.

00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:51,972
I'll write.

148
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:53,431
We need to reach out
to my brother

[KATSUIE]
Don't do this, my lord!

His senior retainers
have pulled away.

156
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:08,780
He's alone without any help.

157
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:11,574
If I don't go to him,
then who will?

158
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:15,412
He has Mino's troops and they've
already stationed at Nagoya.

159
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:17,038
If you were to
leave the castle now,

160
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,999
who's to say they
wouldn't assault Suemori?

00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,291
Please. Stay.

162

My brother would never
approve of such an act.

163
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:23,795
That may be so,

164
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:27,924
but do you really expect that'll
keep Dousan from trying?

165
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:31,928
Sir, pardon, but you're
being asked for.

166
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:38,727
[NOBUKATSU]
What does this concern, Mother?

167
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:40,186
[GOZEN]
Is it true?

168
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:41,980
Mino is an occupying force?

169
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:44,566
Who put these ideas
in your head?

170

This is your castle.

171
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:49,696
Nobuhide‐<i>sama</i>
left Suemori to you,

172
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:53,199
and it's crucial that it
be defended at all costs.

173
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:56,745
If all we do is keep defending,
eventually it'll fall!

174
00:08:56,786 --> 00:09:01,207
I'd ask that you leave matters
of warfare and strategy to me.

175
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,501

176
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:04,753
I apologize.

177
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:06,296
Did we wake you?

178
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:10,550
[HIDETAKA]

[HIDETAKA]
Where are you going?

181
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:14,721
Nowhere, my child.

182
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:18,141
In fact, he just made a promise
to never leave.

183
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:20,435
Isn't that right, Nobukatsu?

184
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:27,859
[KICHOU]
In the end,

185
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:30,445
Nobukatsu‐<i>sama</i>
chose not to move.

186
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:32,572
Nobunaga‐<i>sama</i> left
Nagoya's defenses

187
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:35,784
in the hands of Dousan
and led his troops out.

188
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:37,994
They launched an assault
on Muraki Fortress

189
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:39,996
during an intense storm.

190
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:42,207
This surprise attack
was a success,

191
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,334
and the Imagawa forces withdrew.

192
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:47,545
Nobunaga‐<i>sama</i>
had defended Owari.

193
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:53,343
[NUN] You did not fulfill
the promise you made to us.

194
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:55,011
Care to explain?

195
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:57,931
The arrangement we agreed upon
was for you to draw Nobunaga out

196
00:09:57,972 --> 00:10:01,017
and then take control of Nagoya.

197
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:05,105
We know that, but nobody
could have anticipated

198
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:07,899
that the Mino forces would
be occupying the castle.

199
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:10,610
Then perhaps a more direct
approach is what's required.

200
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:11,236
What?

201
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:12,529
You don't mean.

202
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:15,156
Then he's actually
coming to Owari?

203
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:17,450
There'll be nothing left
after Imagawa‐<i>sama</i> arrives

204
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:19,828
with one hundred
thousand troops.

205
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:22,288
Do you wish to survive this?

206
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:26,626
Then you must perform
a deed to redeem yourselves.

207
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:29,462
Imagawa has got
some new friends.

208
00:10:29,504 --> 00:10:33,216
Both Takeda of Kai
and Houjou of Sagami.

209
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:35,510
That hundred thousand
troops, it's no bluff.

210
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:36,344
Let's hurry.

211
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:38,638
We don't have any time to waste.

212
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:44,185
[NOBUNAGA]
Nobukatsu, I hope you are well.

213
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:46,396
Though we agreed
to meet at New Year's...

214
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:47,522
Huh?

215
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:50,859
...the cherry blossoms
are already in full bloom.

216
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,443
Remember the ostrich?

217
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,821
I thought it was male,
but to everyone's surprise,

218
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:57,991
it ended up laying several eggs.

219
00:10:58,032 --> 00:10:59,325
They're huge, by the way.

220
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:00,910
The size of a gourd!

221
00:11:00,952 --> 00:11:03,204
The bird wasn't inclined
to incubate them,

222
00:11:03,246 --> 00:11:06,040
so we had several rolled
omelets instead.

223
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:10,837
They tasted... Well,
you can probably guess.

If you're too persistent,
he may resent you.

[NOBUNAGA]

You haven't caught
a cold, right?

232
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:31,482
I won't say I want
to see your face,

233
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:34,736
but I'd like a reply, at least.

234
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:38,156
If you knew how much
I wanted to see you.

235
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:41,034
I wish we could go
horseback riding together

236
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:43,369
or gaze up at
the stars and talk.

The way we used to.

238

If so, then put those feelings
to paper and write back to him.

However close you
both used to be,

240
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:52,837
it's difficult to
convey feelings

241
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:56,007
without relying upon
the assistance of words.

As you know.

And seeing as it's the day
of our Lord Buddha's birth.

248
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,605
I was merely paying
a visit in hopes

of asking Nobukatsu‐<i>sama</i>
for a donation.

250

Something he can treasure.

279

It'd express how you feel.

Quick question.

Who's his father?

00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:28,219
Shiba Yoshimune‐<i>sama</i>.

He holds the
highest rank in Owari.

Oh. I see.

326
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:33,349
He's Lord Protector of Owari,

327
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:36,436
while the Principal Line
stood as his proxy.

328
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:41,941
But it's clear Nobutomo‐<i>sama</i>
isn't a man you can depend upon.

329
00:15:41,983 --> 00:15:46,279
The one holding the reins is
his representative, Sakai Daizen

330
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,573
What you're saying is
this Sakai guy's a traitor!

We won't let this stand!

I can stand on my own!

There's no way around it!

We have to give

No. Hold off.

If you refuse to
hand him over to us,

351
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:43,169
then we'll have
to take him by force!

[NOBUNAGA] I guess it's up
to me to protect this baby bird

that's flown into my care,

[TOSHIIE]
Reporting, sir!

363
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:17,411
Kiyosu's defenses are
stronger than we thought.

00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:20,289
We can't break through them.

That bastard, Sakai.

368
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:27,255
He must have allied with them.

369
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:29,840
If so, I think it's safe to
assume they have stockpiles

00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:33,177
of weapons and provisions
in preparation for a siege.

around the East Gate.

We have to stop!

383
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,620
It's madness for the Oda clan
to be killing its own line!

There's no turning back
for us at this point.

So do me a favor, Tono‐<i>sama</i>,

[RETAINER C] The bottom line
is we need more men.

My brother asks that
we send reinforcements.

391
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,814
It was treasonous to attack
the Shiba, the Lord Protectors,
