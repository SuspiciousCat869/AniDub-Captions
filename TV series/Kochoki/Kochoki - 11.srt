1
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:56,908
[TOSHIIE] Looks like
you've lost some weight

2
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,660
since I saw you last.

3
00:01:58,702 --> 00:02:01,121
I hope they're
feeding you enough.

4
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:05,751
[TOSHIIE]
I know, I know.

5
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:08,295
I wish I could spend
more time with you, too.

6
00:02:08,337 --> 00:02:09,630
Maeda‐<i>sama</i>!

7
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:11,006
You've moved up in the world.

8
00:02:11,048 --> 00:02:14,134
There's no reason for you have
to visit the stables anymore.

9
00:02:14,176 --> 00:02:16,720
Oh, it's got nothing
to do with status.

10
00:02:16,762 --> 00:02:20,057
I just can't relax
unless I see their faces.

11
00:02:21,183 --> 00:02:23,060
[PAGE] This raises problems,
Yoshikane‐ <i>sama</i> !

12
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:23,685
[YOSHIKANE]
Silence!

13
00:02:23,727 --> 00:02:24,728
I'm going falconing!

14
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:26,271
Bring out a horse!

15
00:02:28,774 --> 00:02:30,192
Was I not clear?

16
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:31,860
Bring me a horse!

17
00:02:31,902 --> 00:02:34,321
Um, the thing is...

18
00:02:34,363 --> 00:02:36,990
I'm afraid we can't spare
any since Nobunaga‐ <i>sama</i>

19
00:02:37,032 --> 00:02:40,452
is in the middle of a war,
battling the Isa no Kami.

20
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:42,037
I see several horses here.

21
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:43,997
Surely you can spare one.

22
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:45,499
We cannot.

23
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,750
Why you...!

24
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:48,627
Just who do you think
you're addressing?

25
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:50,295
I'm Shiba Yoshikane.

26
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:52,214
Owari's Lord Protector!

27
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:53,924
I'm fully aware of
your name and title

28
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:56,176
and don't need to be reminded.

29
00:02:56,218 --> 00:02:58,804
I'm sorry, but we
can't lend you any.

30
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:00,263
That's that.

31
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:04,059
A horse might be required
at a moment's notice, my lord.

32
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:07,562
You miscreant.

33
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:09,564
[gasps]

34
00:03:11,775 --> 00:03:13,360
Please hold, my lord.

35
00:03:13,402 --> 00:03:14,945
Ikeda‐<i>dono</i>!

36
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:17,030
[YOSHIKANE] For this
ill‐mannered lout to talk

37
00:03:17,072 --> 00:03:20,075
this way to the Lord Protector
of Owari is unforgivable!

38
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:22,411
[TSUNEOKI] It's just as
you say, Yoshikane‐ <i>sama</i> .

39
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:23,704
He's ill mannered.

40
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:26,456
Toshiie, cut open
your stomach immediately.

41
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:32,879
To make amends for his insult,
he shall commit seppuku.

42
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:36,758
As for the beheading,
the honor is yours.

43
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:41,888
If Yoshikane‐ <i>sama</i> ,
the esteemed leader

44
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,056
of the Shiba Buei clan,

45
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:46,309
agrees to perform the
role of <i>kaishaku</i> for him.

46
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:49,938
Then surely this man
will agree to kill himself.

47
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:57,112
Understood.

48
00:03:57,154 --> 00:03:59,698
I'm prepared.

49
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,497
Are you ready, Yoshikane‐<i>sama</i>?

50
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:15,130
[YOSHIKANE]
Enough of this.

51
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:18,508
You may deal with this
miscreant however you wish.

52
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:21,553
[sighs]

53
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:23,638
What's the story with that guy?

54
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,391
We both know the fate of
Yoshikane‐ <i>sama</i> 's father,

55
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:29,060
and how Nobunaga‐ <i>sama</i>
took vengeance on the killer.

56
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:32,564
Sure, which is how that devil
came to be under his protection.

57
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:34,107
It may be true
that the Shiba clan

58
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:36,693
are Owari's Lord
Protectors by name,

59
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:39,988
but the one holding real
authority is Nobunaga‐ <i>sama</i> .

60
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:43,074
In other words, Yoshikane
has a pretty meaningless title.

61
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,075
While it's a nuisance,

62
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:47,287
so far it's been limited
to the occasional diversion.

63
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:49,915
Well, he sure likes
making trouble for us.

64
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,583
Also, since we're
on the subject,

65
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,668
if he had agreed to
perform <i>kaishaku</i> for me,

66
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:57,297
what exactly would
you have done?

67
00:04:57,339 --> 00:04:58,924
If one man's life
puts the issue to rest,

68
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:00,675
I'd call that a bargain.

69
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:01,843
[chuckles]

70
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:03,720
You really are
the worst, Tsuneoki.

71
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:07,474
[BOTH laugh]

72
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:11,895
[KICHOU] In the year 1559,
as chastisement

73
00:05:11,937 --> 00:05:14,773
for plotting an uprising
against Nobunaga‐ <i>sama</i> ,

74
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:18,568
he and Nobukiyo‐ <i>sama</i> attacked
the Oda Ise no Kami clan.

75
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:21,488
Forcing them to
relinquish Iwakura Castle.

76
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:27,869
And that's what people mean

77
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:30,831
when they say he fights
like a demon god!

78
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:34,292
Naturally, Nobunaga‐ <i>sama</i>
would be the one to unify Owari.

79
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:37,420
It looks like we'll finally be
able to sleep easier at night!

80
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:39,506
You've been having trouble
sleeping up till now?

81
00:05:39,548 --> 00:05:41,967
[NOBUMORI] Heh.
It was just a figure of speech.

82
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:44,761
I can sleep anytime, anywhere.

83
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:49,182
[ATTENDANT]
They have arrived.

84
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:53,019
Congratulations on your victory.

85
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:55,981
Ah! My lady,
please come join us!

86
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:59,276
You too, Kitsuno‐<i>sama</i>.

87
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:01,278
Could you not butt in?

88
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:03,238
Come on, Toshiie.

89
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,072
[TOSHIIE]
When he called out,

90
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:05,699
I'd never heard
anything like it.

91
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,784
His voice echoed across
the entire field

92
00:06:07,826 --> 00:06:09,744
and roused our spirits!

93
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:10,829
Is that true?

94
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:13,707
Ordinarily his voice
doesn't carry at all.

95
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:31,725
Elder brother.

96
00:06:33,602 --> 00:06:34,728
Nobukatsu?

97
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:36,980
Nobukatsu!

98
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:40,483
[KITSUNO]
Nobunaga‐<i>sama</i>?

99
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:41,693
[NOBUNAGA]
Huh?

100
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:45,947
[sighs]

101
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:48,033
Tonight we drink heartily.

102
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:52,662
Everyone, drink up!

103
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:54,581
[RETAINERS]
Yeah!

104
00:06:54,623 --> 00:06:56,625
Nobunaga‐ <i>sama</i> doesn't
usually drink this much!

105
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,668
Tonight must be
a special occasion!

106
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:01,922
If my lord commands it,
I'll obey.

107
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:03,048
Something the matter?

108
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:05,592
All of that good cheer
you're seeing is only a front.

109
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:06,635
Huh?

110
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:13,016
[TSUNEOKI] He's still grieving
the loss of Nobukatsu‐ <i>sama</i> .

111
00:07:13,058 --> 00:07:15,060
It weighs heavily on him.

112
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:28,782
What's the story with that monk?

113
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:30,700
He belongs to the Douboushuu.

114
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:32,577
Practitioners of various arts.

115
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:35,789
Tea ceremony,
flower arranging, et cetera.

116
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:38,249
In other words,
they smell out money

117
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,961
and try to cozy up
to those who have it.

118
00:07:42,671 --> 00:07:43,380
[NOBUNAGA]
What's this?

119
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:46,174
An incense burner.

120
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:49,052
What a truly
remarkable design it has.

121
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:50,971
It's of Chinese origin.

122
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:52,639
I was fortunate
enough to acquire it

123
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:54,599
and wanted to show you.

124
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:58,853
Since you're an individual
who appreciates beauty.

125
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:04,693
Please, allow me to
demonstrate how it works.

126
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:08,697
This variety of incense
is extremely uncommon.

127
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:14,452
It certainly possesses
an agreeable smell.

128
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,603
I heard a thud.

129
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:41,980
Is everything...

130
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:44,399
Nobunaga‐<i>sama</i>!

131
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:45,483
You filth!

132
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,152
What were you
trying to do to him?

133
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:48,945
[JUUAMI]
I wasn't doing anything!

134
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:49,904
What's going on?

135
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:50,697
[TOSHIIE]
Unhand it!

136
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:52,615
Are you all right, my lord?

137
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:54,576
[JUUAMI]
He must've been exhausted!

138
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:56,745
This incense is known
for relieving tension.

139
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:57,954
[TOSHIIE]
Stop lying!

140
00:08:57,996 --> 00:09:00,290
Show me what you were
trying to hide in your robe!

141
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:01,041
I assure you,

142
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:04,127
I've absolutely no idea
what you're referring to, sir.

143
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:06,421
Then I'll have to make
you show me by force!

144
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:07,756
I beg you, stop!

145
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:09,841
I don't have anything on me!

146
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:13,386
[TOSHIIE]
Why, you...

147
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:14,971
What did you do?

148
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,730
[TOSHIIE]
That's the whole truth!

149
00:09:23,772 --> 00:09:24,856
I walked in and saw the monk

150
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:27,358
attempting
to kill Nobunaga‐ <i>sama</i> !

151
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:34,741
You were also present when
this occurred, Kazumasu?

152
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:36,868
I can't explain,
but something felt wrong,

153
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,871
and when I entered the room, I
found Toshiie‐ <i>dono</i> and the monk

154
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:41,748
already engaged
in a struggle.

155
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:43,374
We couldn't
investigate the incense

156
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:46,461
since it was scattered
all over the floor.

157
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:49,339
Well, Toshiie,
what evidence do you have?

158
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,132
Afterwards, when I
searched the monk's robe,

159
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:56,763
what I discovered was this.

160
00:09:56,805 --> 00:09:58,473
That's just a hairpin.

161
00:09:58,515 --> 00:10:01,434
Is it possible to kill
a person with one of those?

162
00:10:02,894 --> 00:10:06,231
The Douboushuu are a troupe
of what were originally monks.

163
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:09,818
They have strong ties to shrines
and temples in every region.

164
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:13,154
If we don't have evidence he
targeted Nobunaga‐ <i>sama</i> 's life,

165
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:14,739
it could start trouble.

166
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:18,159
And we can't afford to make
another enemy currently.

167
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,038
[TOSHIIE]
I must pay the price.

168
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,206
[NOBUNAGA]
You what?

169
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:26,459
I'll leave and never return.

170
00:10:26,501 --> 00:10:28,378
You'll remain here!

171
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:29,838
[TOSHIIE] If I'm no
longer in your company,

172
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:33,842
the Douboushuu won't have any
reason to condemn you, my lord.

173
00:10:34,843 --> 00:10:36,719
His blood's on my hands.

174
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:38,638
No one else's.

175
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:43,184
If one man's life puts the issue
to rest, that's a bargain right?

176
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:49,607
However, should the need arise.

177
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:52,694
I will come running to
Nobunaga‐ <i>sama</i> 's side!

178
00:10:58,491 --> 00:10:59,200
Toshiie!

179
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:02,036
It's fine this way.

180
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:04,038
Until we meet again.

181
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,707
Be well.

182
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:14,841
[NOBUNAGA]
Kichou left.

183
00:11:14,883 --> 00:11:16,759
Nobukatsu is dead.

184
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:18,636
Now Toshiie is gone.

185
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:21,806
I haven't been able
to protect anyone.

186
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:25,643
[TAKUGEN] As of late, there's
been a great deal of coming

187
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:29,522
and going of the Douboushuu
between Owari and Mino.

188
00:11:29,564 --> 00:11:30,773
Then you suspect
their activities

189
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:34,402
are somehow being orchestrated
by Saitou Yoshitatsu?

190
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:35,236
[TAKUGEN]
No.

191
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:38,615
His role is merely
that of an intermediary.

192
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:43,328
The one pulling
the strings seems to be.

193
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:45,455
Shiba Yoshikane‐<i>sama</i>.

194
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:46,664
What?

195
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,374
Then this coming and going.

196
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,752
They're exchanging
correspondence.

197
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:51,461
[TAKUGEN]
Yes.

198
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:53,671
We need to get our
hands on those letters.

199
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:55,298
It'll be done.

200
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:58,468
[YOSHIKANE]
It's absurd!

201
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:01,095
What on earth does he mean
summoning me to him?

202
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:04,182
[YOSHIKANE RETAINER] I cannot
even begin to imagine, my lord.

203
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:05,558
Damn!

204
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,560
His rudeness knows no bounds!

205
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:19,364
I wish to know
what this is about.

206
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:21,324
First, you will take a seat.

207
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,918
There's a matter
that concerns us.

208
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,962
[YOSHIKANE]
A matter?

209
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:36,464
Well, what is it?

210
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:38,758
It's recently come to our
attention that the Douboushuu

211
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,220
have made trips back and forth,
crossing into Mino.

212
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:45,098
Mino is watching
Nobunaga‐ <i>sama</i> ,

213
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:48,434
and its leader is waiting for
an opening to strike him down.

214
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:49,727
So what of it?

215
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:53,022
I don't see what any of
this has to do with me.

216
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:54,774
[TSUNEOKI]
We've intercepted...

217
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:58,611
...some correspondence.

218
00:12:58,653 --> 00:13:00,113
And it's quite damning.

219
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:01,698
[YOSHIKANE]
What are you insinuating?

220
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:05,952
You petitioned
Saitou Yoshitatsu‐ <i>dono</i>

221
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:08,496
and asked that
Nobunaga‐ <i>sama</i> be murdered.

222
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:10,123
Attempting to
oblige your request,

223
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:13,543
Juuami was sent here to
carry out the assassination.

224
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:16,170
As stated clearly
in this letter.

225
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:19,632
Toshiie was telling
us the truth.

226
00:13:19,674 --> 00:13:20,967
What have you done?

227
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:23,177
Have you completely forgotten
it was Nobunaga‐ <i>sama</i>

228
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:24,971
who avenged your father's death?

229
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:25,638
Stop!

230
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,850
And you chose to repay
the debt by betraying him?

231
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:32,437
[NOBUNAGA]
Yoshikane‐<i>dono</i>.

232
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:36,733
I want to hear you
tell me in your own words.

233
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:40,278
Did you try to have me killed?

234
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:46,284
Yes!

235
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:47,660
What if I did?

236
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:49,203
What's wrong with that?

237
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:52,332
I am Lord Protector of Owari!

238
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:54,167
Release me, you insolent dogs!

239
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:56,419
Don't you know who I am?

240
00:13:56,461 --> 00:13:59,130
[NOBUNAGA]
Betrayed once again.

241
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:04,427
[KICHOU] Nobunaga‐ <i>sama</i> , full
of despair, saw only one choice.

242
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:06,804
He banished Yoshikane‐<i>sama</i>.

243
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:10,058
Because of this,
the Shiba Buei clan fell apart,

244
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:13,019
and Nobunaga‐ <i>sama</i>
became Owari's ruler.

245
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:17,899
Thereafter, a messenger
arrived from the shogunate.

246
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,360
It seemed that the rumor of
Yoshikane‐ <i>sama</i> 's banishment

247
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:23,488
had reached the nominal
holder of the Shogun title.

248
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,656
Ashikaga Yoshiteru.

249
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:32,288
[TSUNEOKI] So, you've received
a summons from the shogunate

250
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:33,998
demanding that
you explain the particulars

251
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,334
regarding why you exiled
the Lord Protector.

252
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:39,629
While it's a nuisance,
I don't suppose I can ignore it.

253
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:45,885
Gather them all together.

254
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:55,019
So, we're taking a trip
to the capital, huh?

255
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:59,732
I've selected you
all to ride with me.

256
00:14:59,774 --> 00:15:02,735
We're honored, but don't you
want more than seven?

257
00:15:02,777 --> 00:15:05,822
There're dangers, but a
large force is unacceptable.

258
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:09,575
It might be viewed as taking
arms against the Emperor.

259
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:12,412
Off we go.

260
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:23,881
So this is crucian carp sushi.

261
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:29,053
I know it's
my first time trying it,

262
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:31,931
but don't you find the
flavor to be slightly odd?

263
00:15:33,808 --> 00:15:36,144
Maybe it's because
we're so close to the capital,

264
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:39,105
but I greatly prefer
our traditional food.

265
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:48,281
Thank you very much.

266
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:50,783
Beware of itinerant monks.

267
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:59,000
Ah! Tsuneoki‐<i>dono</i>!

268
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,835
We want your opinion on these.

269
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:02,253
You there!

270
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,426
Who sent you?

271
00:16:14,891 --> 00:16:17,143
Looks like
an assassin from Mino.

272
00:16:17,185 --> 00:16:19,520
How did you suspect
he was going to strike?

273
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:21,022
I...

274
00:16:27,445 --> 00:16:28,988
[KICHOU]
Thus did Nobunaga‐ <i>sama</i> arrive

275
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:32,325
at his destination,
the capital, Kyoto.

276
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:38,080
[MORISHIGE]
So this is the famed Kamo River.

277
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:39,665
Remarkable bridge too.

278
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:41,167
There're so many wonders.

279
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:43,753
And look at the
five‐storied pagoda!

280
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:46,756
[TSUNEOKI] Remember, we didn't
come all this was to sightsee.

281
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:48,591
We're not out of danger.

282
00:16:48,633 --> 00:16:50,426
Don't let your guard down.

283
00:16:50,468 --> 00:16:51,677
Now now, Tsuneoki,

284
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:55,139
it's only natural they'd get
excited by all the new sights.

285
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:58,559
I mean, just look at
how wide this street is!

286
00:16:58,601 --> 00:17:00,353
[sighs]
You'll never change.

287
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:04,524
[KICHOU] Nobunaga‐ <i>sama</i>
and company took lodgings

288
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:06,234
in a temple while
awaiting permission

289
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:09,111
for an audience with the Shogun.

290
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:11,239
However, they soon
discovered permission

291
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,407
was not readily granted.

292
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:17,662
[KATSUIE] To summon someone
and not even grant an audience.

293
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:20,289
What on earth are they thinking?

294
00:17:20,331 --> 00:17:22,375
A great many people
surround the Shogun.

295
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:25,753
So many in fact, it would appear
news reaches his ear slowly.

296
00:17:25,795 --> 00:17:27,129
They're making a mockery of him.

297
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:29,006
How long do
they expect us to wait?

298
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,300
When one is forced into
a position of stagnation,

299
00:17:31,342 --> 00:17:33,594
the body begins
to grow lax as well.

300
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:36,138
I think I'll go work
on my swordplay.

301
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,307
Same for me.

302
00:17:38,349 --> 00:17:40,017
Shall we practice
alongside them?

303
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,602
What else can we do?

304
00:17:41,644 --> 00:17:43,896
[MINO AGENT A]
Pardon me, sirs!

305
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:44,897
We arrived after hearing

306
00:17:44,939 --> 00:17:47,900
that Oda Kazusa no Suke‐ <i>dono</i>
was staying here.

307
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:52,071
[NOBUNAGA] Am I to assume
your presence means the Shogun

308
00:17:52,113 --> 00:17:54,073
will grant an audience with me?

309
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:54,907
Certainly!

310
00:17:54,949 --> 00:17:56,993
Your request has gone smoothly,

311
00:17:57,034 --> 00:18:01,038
and soon you'll have the
pleasure of meeting him.

312
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:10,798
It took them long enough.

313
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,049
My thoughts exactly.

314
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:14,760
Look. I'll hear no
more complaining, all right?

315
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:17,930
We'll meet with the Shogun,
then head right back to Owari.

316
00:18:18,973 --> 00:18:20,433
Why'd we stop?

317
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:28,357
What?

318
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:29,400
It can't be.

319
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:31,777
You mean even this was a trap?!

320
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:32,570
Who are you?

321
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:34,155
Mino's agents?

322
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:46,042
They're tough, whoever they are!

323
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:47,752
Guard Nobunaga‐<i>sama</i>!

324
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:52,131
Was the summons
a trap by Mino too?

325
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:03,100
Damn it!

326
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,185
Nobunaga‐<i>sama</i>!

327
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:05,519
He's been pulled away!

328
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:06,437
Retreat!

329
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:09,273
It's all we can do
just to hold them back!

330
00:19:12,902 --> 00:19:15,613
‐‐Nobunaga‐<i>sama</i>!
‐‐Nobunaga‐<i>sama</i>!

331
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:49,146
[KATSUIE]
Hold it!

332
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:51,691
After everything,
it's you, Kich‐‐

333
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:53,109
You're wrong.

334
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:56,320
In appearance and in name,

335
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:58,656
I am not the same person I was.

336
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:04,203
Is that so?

337
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:11,419
You may have changed, but will
you return and stay by my side?

338
00:20:19,844 --> 00:20:23,013
I'm yours, your shadow.

339
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:25,057
If you wish it.

340
00:20:25,099 --> 00:20:26,726
I will.

341
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:29,520
I'll stay by your side forever.

342
00:20:34,692 --> 00:20:36,402
[TSUNEOKI]
Nobunaga‐<i>sama</i>!

343
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:41,449
[TSUNEOKI] So the
supposed audience was a ploy.

344
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:48,456
We'll head back for
Owari early tomorrow.

345
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:50,916
But first, one question.

346
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:52,460
[KICHOU]
Yes.

347
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:55,379
What should I call you?

348
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:59,175
I'm Baba Reijirou.

349
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:01,177
Reijirou, is it?

350
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:05,097
I invite you to join
the Cloaked Guard.

351
00:21:05,139 --> 00:21:08,392
As for your past,
it doesn't matter.

352
00:21:10,561 --> 00:21:11,896
I'd hate to think what
would have happened

353
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:15,191
if you hadn't shown up.
I have no objections!

354
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:17,568
There's no doubt
your skills are superb.

355
00:21:20,488 --> 00:21:22,156
How about it?

356
00:21:22,198 --> 00:21:24,241
I accept, my lord.

357
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,412
It doesn't matter
how much he's betrayed,

358
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:30,331
the people who count
always seem to find a way

359
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:31,999
of coming back into his life.

360
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:34,752
[KATSUIE]
Mm.

361
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:36,504
[TSUNEOKI]
Then again.

362
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:38,672
That's Nobunaga‐<i>sama</i>.

363
00:21:47,515 --> 00:21:50,017
Reports say the Yamaguchis,
father and son,

364
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:53,312
committed seppuku,
by order of Imagawa Yoshimoto.

365
00:21:53,354 --> 00:21:55,815
Murdering those
who were obedient to him.

366
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:57,233
It's truly barbaric.

367
00:21:57,274 --> 00:21:59,109
[NOBUNAGA]
This means one thing.

368
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:02,321
Imagawa is rousing
himself to action.

369
00:22:05,241 --> 00:22:08,369
[KICHOU] It was at this time,
the greatest test Nobunaga‐ <i>sama</i>

370
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:12,331
had ever encountered
was about to fall upon him.
