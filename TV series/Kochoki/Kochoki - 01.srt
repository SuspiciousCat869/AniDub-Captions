1
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:26,068
[NOBUNAGA] Listen carefully
and heed my words!

2
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:28,111
Luck is for Heaven to decide!

3
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:30,072
If they charge, retreat.

4
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:32,616
If they fall back,
press forward!

5
00:00:32,658 --> 00:00:34,117
And if we're victorious,

6
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:37,454
history will remember those
of you who fought here today!

7
00:00:37,496 --> 00:00:41,583
I swear, your names
will echo through eternity!

8
00:00:42,334 --> 00:00:43,669
Ride with me!

9
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,213
[SOLDIERS]
Yeah!

10
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:52,553
[NARRATOR] I've heard a story,
how in the spring of 1560,

11
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:57,307
at Okehazama Gorge,
Nobunaga‐<i>sama</i> attacked.

12
00:00:57,349 --> 00:01:00,435
And with only a force
of 2,000 elite fighters,

13
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:05,691
successfully defeated Imagawa
Yoshimoto's force of 45,000.

14
00:01:07,943 --> 00:01:10,028
Don't let these
little fish distract you!

15
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:13,740
Our target is the head
of Imagawa Yoshimoto!

16
00:01:14,575 --> 00:01:17,077
[NARRATOR] His tactics
were like a raging fire.

17
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:18,412
Terrifying.

18
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:21,206
They called him a
demon god, a Hell‐fiend.

19
00:01:21,248 --> 00:01:24,001
But before acquiring
those monikers,

20
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:26,753
he was someone
completely different.

21
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:28,255
This evening,

22
00:01:28,297 --> 00:01:30,632
I wish to tell you
a little about him.

23
00:01:30,674 --> 00:01:32,759
The real Nobunaga‐<i>sama</i>.

24
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:35,012
Who he really was.

25
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:44,313
[TSUNEOKI]
Kippoushi‐<i>sama</i>!

26
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:46,064
Kippoushi‐<i>sama</i>!

27
00:01:49,693 --> 00:01:52,154
[yawns]

28
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:54,197
Good morning, Katsusaburou.

29
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:55,741
More like afternoon.

30
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:56,825
[NOBUNAGA]
These shutters do a good job

31
00:01:56,867 --> 00:01:58,910
of keeping out the light.

32
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:05,542
Uh‐huh. I figured this
place would be a disaster.

33
00:02:05,584 --> 00:02:06,585
[NOBUNAGA]
Look!

34
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:07,878
It's called a musket.

35
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:11,298
Takugen showed me a drawing,
so I tried making my own.

36
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:14,134
You load gunpowder into it,
take aim, then bang!

37
00:02:14,176 --> 00:02:16,637
A metal ball takes
down your enemy!

38
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:18,597
You mean that
stick does all that?

39
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:21,141
Impossible.

40
00:02:21,183 --> 00:02:23,810
We have more pressing
matters to attend to.

41
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:26,688
A foreign barbarians' ship
has arrived at Tsushima.

42
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,899
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

43
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:39,951
Let's go see about
that ship, Katsusaburou!

44
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:49,503
Where're you
headed off to, Brother?]

45
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:52,172
Just over to Tsushima
to break in some horses.

46
00:02:52,214 --> 00:02:53,465
Please, can I come with you?

47
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:55,300
[GOZEN]
No, you may not.

48
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:58,720
What would happen if you
were thrown off while riding?

49
00:02:58,762 --> 00:03:00,305
Maybe when you're older.

50
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:01,348
I'll be off then.

51
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:02,641
Goodbye, Mother.

52
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:06,228
Farewell, my lady.

53
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:12,484
The boy's keen
on his horse rides.

54
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:13,777
Do you think he's
too preoccupied

55
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:15,320
with leisurely activities?

56
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:17,614
I've no idea what's going
through my son's head,

57
00:03:17,656 --> 00:03:19,991
nor do I particularly
care to find out.

58
00:03:41,138 --> 00:03:41,805
[ROKUROU]
You're late.

59
00:03:41,847 --> 00:03:43,014
Yeah, I overslept.

60
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,433
I thought you
were supposed to be

61
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:45,809
keeping a close eye on him.

62
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:46,601
I am!

63
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,854
So, what're you thinking?

64
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:51,231
Most of the packed goods
have already been hauled off.

65
00:03:51,273 --> 00:03:52,941
Just scraps now.

66
00:03:52,983 --> 00:03:56,069
[NOBUNAGA]
Don't get flustered.

67
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:58,363
There's our mark.

68
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:05,203
And... go!

69
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:13,462
Damn chickens!

70
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:15,505
You're not injured, are you?

71
00:04:15,547 --> 00:04:17,090
[ROKUROU sighs]

72
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:20,510
Well, all this cargo's gonna
need to be repacked now.

73
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:22,596
What do you say
we give you a hand?

74
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:23,930
For a small fee.

75
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:26,057
[sighs]
After you've picked it up.

76
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:28,393
Don't get greedy.

77
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:35,442
[ROKUROU]
How'd it go?

78
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:36,902
It couldn't have
gone any better!

79
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:38,487
They took off
without even noticing

80
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:41,323
that we skimmed
a little bit off the top.

81
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:46,495
Beautiful!

82
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:48,455
Wow! Jackpot!

83
00:04:48,497 --> 00:04:51,208
Look at all the treasure those
barbarians were hoarding!

84
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:54,252
Make sure it all arrives safely
at Takugen Oshou's temple.

85
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,378
He's affiliated with the Mino,

86
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,589
which means it'll
never be traced to us.

87
00:04:57,631 --> 00:04:58,882
Good thinking.

88
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:00,926
But still, in order to
move this out of the harbor,

89
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:03,929
we need to find some way
to sneak past the guardhouse.

90
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,806
I guess that won't work.

91
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:09,142
If we could conceal it somehow.

92
00:05:09,184 --> 00:05:10,560
And not be suspicious.

93
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:12,604
We're way ahead of you.

94
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,445
Think this will do?

95
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:21,613
[TAKICHI]
A barrel coffin?

96
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:22,656
Brilliant!

97
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:24,199
No guard'll be curious enough

98
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:26,326
to wanna take a look
inside one of those.

99
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:27,994
You have such
clever ideas, my lord.

100
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:29,621
It's obvious that
your brain was created

101
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:31,414
differently than
the rest of ours.

102
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:32,457
Ah, come on.

103
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:34,626
It's time we left,
Kippoushi‐<i>sama</i>.

104
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:35,627
You're right.

105
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:38,296
I'll leave the
heavy‐lifting up to you guys.

106
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:42,676
[ROKUROU]
Before you go.

107
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:44,886
[NOBUNAGA]
Hmm?

108
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:47,305
The only reason we've survived
this long is 'cause of you.

109
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,015
And we'll never forget that.

110
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:53,186
Something to add
to the collection.

111
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:54,729
Take it!

112
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:01,236
I'd say you've become

113
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:04,239
a veritable chief of pilferers,
Kippoushi‐<i>sama</i>.

114
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:06,283
I prefer to be called
a gentleman thief!

115
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:07,826
I'm simply sharing
the massive treasure

116
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:10,954
my father's accumulated
with those less fortunate.

117
00:06:10,996 --> 00:06:12,122
How generous.

118
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:14,583
I'm sure the Lord Protector
of Mikawa will appreciate

119
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:16,167
your charitable works.

120
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:17,460
Hey, now!

121
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:19,087
[TSUNEOKI]
You know he'll find out.

122
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:21,089
Like I've said, it was a
mistake for you to befriend

123
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:23,466
that sort of crowd
in the first place.

124
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:25,051
Sounds like you're jealous.

125
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:26,553
I am not jealous!

126
00:06:26,595 --> 00:06:28,722
My only concern is for
the future of the Oda clan,

127
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:31,057
which your actions
happen to be jeopardizing!

128
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:33,018
I'll race you to the castle!

129
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:33,894

00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:35,729
[NOBUNAGA] If you win,
I'll give you a prize!

131
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,772
As if you've ever won!

Ha!

00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:51,077
You're not hurt, are you?

136
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:53,079
Only startled, I think.

137
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:04,174
No, I... It's my fault.

138
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:06,217
Will you forgive me?

139
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:07,385
[TSUNEOKI]
Are you all right?

140
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,012
Please.

00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:11,056
Allow me to help you
to your feet.

That's very kind of you.

143
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:16,728
[TSUNEOKI]
I'd like to take her home.

144
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,897
Yeah, please do.

145
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:24,235
All right, I'll be off then.

[NOBUKATSU]
Whatcha looking at?

147
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:42,629
Huh?

148

[shrieks]
Don't sneak up on me like that.

That's such a beautiful stone.

Could you tell me
where you found it?

151
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:49,678
[NOBUNAGA]
Uh... Where I found it.

Oh, sure.
I'll tell you everything.

As soon as we go downstairs.

I was also kinda
hoping you'd tell me

what you do up
here all day, Brother.

just boring scholarly
stuff mostly‐‐

[NOBUKATSU]
I don't care if it's boring.

159

I want to stay up here
and read books with you.

160

No! Right now!

You can have this musket

What's a musket?

It's an armament the

provinces of Mino and Mikawa,

and the clan's so overrun

but that doesn't
change anything!

Katsusaburou scolded me the
other day for the same reason.

238

I was bringing it up more as an
observation than as criticism.

239
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:10,336
After all, my diverting of
the foreigner's rare goods

240
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:13,590
through the black market
has proven quite lucrative.

241
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:17,051
And has greatly improved
the mood of Mino's Saitou clan.

242
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:19,137
Additionally, children
left dispossessed by the war

243
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:20,513
have benefitted.

It's a good system all around,

disturbed even slightly,

[GOZEN]
Kanjuurou told us.

258
00:12:10,188 --> 00:12:12,482
He saw you in
possession of this item.

So I ordered
your rooms searched.

That's an import from
the foreign barbarians.

261

Odd it was found in your
room right after there was

a discrepancy reported
with the ship's inventory.

Where did you obtain it?

264
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:27,163
I found it by the river.

have been able to fence it

as they were passing by.

in your hidden room

Don't mind me.

I was just wrapping up
some falconing

seniors a history lesson?

292

This castle used to
belong to the Imagawa

before my father
and I seized it.

It makes perfect sense if there
are one or two concealed rooms

That was several years before
Kanjuurou was even born.

unnoticed for so long?

00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:32,580
The dock workers
were talking about it,

322
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:34,957
so I know it's a sure thing.

323

But after this, it's over.

Why did you agree to
go along with their plan?

This is the last time.

You expect their kind
to keep their promises?

Friendship means
trusting the other person.

Why're you telling me this?

329
00:14:54,936 --> 00:14:56,938
Because I don't have
that level of trust in anyone

No sign of him yet.

I'd advise you to choose

Once spoken,
they can't be taken back.

Where's Roku and the others?

[TAKUGEN] Apparently, they
were arrested for their crimes

382
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:57,850
by Tsushima's "Faction

confine Kippoushi‐<i>sama</i>

from meeting Roku.

Your timing could not
have been better.

exterminate a few rats.

Why am I even asking.

Not as if I believe it but
someone claimed you kept company

were a common thief

Let's begin. Bring it here.

You're going to use a musket?

at your target like so.

I trust you'll use it well.

481
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:00,509
And one more thing.

482
00:21:00,551 --> 00:21:03,220
I leave that crew
under your supervision.

483
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:07,433
Do me a favor, teach them not
to nibble at my warehouses.

484
00:21:07,475 --> 00:21:09,143
Yes, Father!

485
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:13,439
[TSUNEOKI]
Kippoushi‐<i>sama</i>!

486
00:21:13,481 --> 00:21:15,858
What's the matter?

487
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,359
[NOBUNAGA]
That was terrifying.

488
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:19,445
[TSUNEOKI]
Huh?

489
00:21:19,487 --> 00:21:21,363
The way my father's face looked.

490
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:23,491
Did you see it?

491
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:26,535
I was certain that
he was going to kill me!

492
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:31,999
Even in the face of death,
you stood your ground.

493
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:39,590
[NARRATOR]
New Year's, 1546.

494
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:42,802
Kippoushi‐<i>sama</i> came of age
and changed his name.

495
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:47,223
From that day forward, he was
known as Oda Saburou Nobunaga.

496
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:48,182
An auspicious name,

497
00:21:48,224 --> 00:21:51,227
signifying one who'll govern
the realm for a long time.

498
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:52,520
Nobunaga.

499
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:54,480
I will be counting on you.

500
00:21:54,522 --> 00:21:55,856
Yes, sir!

501
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:59,109
[NARRATOR] The following year,
Nobunaga‐<i>sama</i>,

502
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:02,446
along with his guardian Hirate
Masahide and others,

503
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:03,906
attacked Oohama.

504
00:22:03,948 --> 00:22:06,283
Where an Imagawa
army was deployed.

505
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:10,079
He was lauded for
a remarkable first battle.

506
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:14,208
This took place in the spring
after his fourteenth birthday.
