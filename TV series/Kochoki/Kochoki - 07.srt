[GOZEN]
Come now, Hidetaka!

3
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:30,364
Could you at least try to keep
your robes from getting dirty?

4
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:33,200
Sorry, Mother,
but he's in his own world

5
00:00:33,242 --> 00:00:35,869
and can't hear anyone else.

6
00:00:35,911 --> 00:00:38,038
Hidetaka‐<i>sama</i> has
a deep appreciation

7
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,374
for all manner of insects.

8
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:42,834
[GOZEN]
He's not like normal children.

9
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:45,003
I wish for him to
live quietly somewhere,

10
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:48,423
away from the strictures
of a samurai family.

00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:50,342
[NOBUKATSU]
You can put your mind at ease.

12
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:54,012
As long as he lives,
I'll protect him from any harm.

00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:55,931
I trust you will.

[NOBUKATSU]
Hidetaka.

00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:07,818
Show me your latest discovery.

16
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:10,112
Sure. Look at this!

00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:11,863
[GOZEN]
Huh? Is that true?

18
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:14,866
Yes, during the recent battle.

19
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:18,161
Nobukatsu‐<i>sama</i> dismounted
and charged the enemy.

20
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:21,373
And even came close to
losing his life in the process.

21
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:22,749
That's horrifying,

22
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:25,752
and after I told him not
to leave his horse's saddle.

23
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:29,339
I beg you, my lady,
do not reproach him.

24
00:01:29,381 --> 00:01:30,882
His only concern
was helping the one

25
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:33,552
who inherited control
over the family.

26
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:35,679
He's blameless.

27
00:01:35,721 --> 00:01:37,681
Nobunaga.

28
00:01:37,723 --> 00:01:39,725
Fool. He's selfish.

29
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:41,351
And one day he'll ruin us.

30
00:01:41,393 --> 00:01:43,061
Though he holds power.

31
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:45,105
I don't want him in our lives.

32
00:01:45,147 --> 00:01:46,940
That would be hard
to pull off, at least,

33
00:01:46,982 --> 00:01:51,111
as long as the bonds
of brotherhood hold.

34
00:01:51,153 --> 00:01:51,903
Luckily.

35
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:54,615
I have a stratagem in mind.

[GOZEN]
A stratagem?

37
00:01:57,034 --> 00:01:58,660
I hate to think how
things would've turned out

38
00:01:58,702 --> 00:02:01,121
if Nobukatsu hadn't shown up.

39
00:02:01,163 --> 00:02:04,625
Yes, my guts were
churning with fear.

40
00:02:08,045 --> 00:02:11,006
[NOBUNAGA] It looked like he had
something he wanted to tell me.

The way things stand now,

42
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:16,261
he can't appear
overly familiar with you.

43
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:19,139
I only wish that he
would speak his mind.

[TSUNEOKI]
We've arrived, my lord.

45

Kitsuno‐<i>dono</i>.

47
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:04,536
Thank you again for
your help the other day.

48
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:07,038
How have you been since
we last ran into each other?

49
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,749
I've been keeping busy.

50
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,167
With so many
guests to take care of,

51
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:12,169
there's hardly any free time.

52
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:13,712
Seems the estate has changed.

53
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:16,006
I hear it's become a place
for cultural exchange,

54
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:18,341
frequented by
foreign traders and monks.

[KITSUNO]
Yes.

56
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:22,304
Many people deepen their
cultural understanding here

57
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:24,973
by exchanging information
about different countries

58
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:26,641
and business practices.

I'll introduce
you around, my lord.

[NOBUNAGA] I got a thank‐you
gift for Nobukatsu too.

64
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:49,748
Everything worked out!

65
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:52,209
I hope he's pleased by it.

66
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,084
Please don't tell me

67
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:55,962
you're thinking of
delivering his gift in person.

68
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:57,214
You mean I can't?

69
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:58,924
[TSUNEOKI]
Of course not.

[sighs]

71
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:01,968
I'll serve as a messenger

72
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,638
and will communicate
your feelings clearly to him.

73
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:06,681
Sounds perfect!

00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:08,225
Please do that!

It's too dangerous, my lord!

[HIDETAKA RETAINER B]
Hidetaka‐<i>sama</i>!

00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:18,485
I'm just fine!

Who is this Hidetaka‐<i>sama</i>?

Nobunaga‐<i>sama</i>'s
younger brother.

I got one! Look!

Are you okay, Hidetaka‐<i>sama</i>?

I see you found
a diving beetle larva.

Insects fascinate you as well?

84
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,966
I used to play with them a lot.

85
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:41,883
This season you can find

86
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:44,094
dragonfly nymphs
and water fireflies.

Of course. Sounds fun.

Until then.

And that's a promise!

00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,696
There's something
about Hidetaka‐<i>sama</i>.

95
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:04,281
Almost soothing.

96

[NOBUKATSU] If only we could
speak heart‐to‐heart one time.

Thank my brother
for these rare goods.

I appreciate the gifts.

[TSUNEOKI]
I will.

100
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:28,305
Additionally, I have a proposal
that I wish to put forward.

101
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:33,101
What would you say to holding an
audience with Nobunaga‐ <i>sama</i> ?

102
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:36,563
He believes this would allow
for a more candid exchange.

103
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:38,356
To be perfectly honest. I was‐‐

[TSUZUKI] You put my lord
in a difficult position.

00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:41,943
Nobunaga‐<i>sama</i> has left us

106
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:44,863
with serious doubts
concerning his leadership.

107
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:47,198
[TSUNEOKI]
And what does that mean?

108
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,911
Need I cite multiple examples
of your lord's selfish behavior?

109
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:52,662
We find it incomprehensible

110
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:55,290
and are concerned about
the Oda clan's future.

111
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:56,291
You're what?

112
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:57,250
Tsuzuki‐<i>dono</i>!

113
00:06:57,292 --> 00:06:59,252
How dare you
interrupt like that?

114
00:06:59,294 --> 00:07:02,339
Tsuzuki, that was rude.

115
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,885
I feel I've spoken too
forwardly with you.

116
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:13,308
I apologize for that,
Ikeda‐<i>dono</i>.

117
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:14,768
He hasn't been with us long

118
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:17,604
and still hasn't gotten a
grasp of how things work.

119
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:20,440
To be clear, we don't share
his feelings in any way.

We have treated
you rudely today.

[TSUNEOKI]
No.

123
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:29,866
If Nobunaga‐<i>sama</i> were here,
he'd most likely laugh it off.

124
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:32,953
He's a person who never tries
to fetter what's in our hearts.

Retainers or otherwise.

126
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:41,586
[TOSHIIE] What was that piece
of filth Tsuzuki's problem?

127
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:44,339
Next time I'll kill
him on the spot.

128
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:46,883
Seriously though,
what a complete idiot.

129
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:49,970
Shooting his mouth off like
that without even thinking.

130
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:52,806
Actually, I suspect
it was calculated.

131
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:54,015
[TOSHIIE]
Hmm?

132
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:57,560
Like deliberately tossing
a stone into still waters.

133
00:07:57,602 --> 00:08:00,522
No doubt there was
some motive behind it.

134
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:06,027
Tsuzuki, what on earth
were you thinking?

135
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:07,529
I was only stating
the shared opinion

136
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,864
on behalf of everyone else.

137
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:12,283
And just as others have
judged the current situation,

138
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:14,995
I also find it dangerous.

139
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:17,205
Nobunaga‐<i>sama</i> controls us.

140
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:19,666
Ah! Not you too?

141
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:22,252
I don't want to
lead over the clan!

142
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:24,462
My brother inherited that role,

143
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:27,132
and it's what
my father wished for.

144
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:29,843
And yet Nobunaga‐<i>sama</i> couldn't
even be bothered to show up

145
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:33,388
for Nobuhide‐ <i>sama</i> 's funeral.

146

That's not all.

147
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:37,183
He let Mino troops
into his castle,

148
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:39,728
and there was the
Muraki conflict.

00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:41,980
His thought process isn't clear.

150
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:43,773
That much is obvious.

151
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:46,067
We can't rely on him.

[GOZEN]
I'm in agreement.

Nobunaga is a
wellspring of troubles.

I have no doubt one day

he'll bring great misfortune
upon the Oda clan.

162
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:28,526
Get out of here.

163
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,528
I feel surrounded.

164
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:34,824
Everybody's raising me up,
trying to manipulate me.

165
00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:37,869
It's as if I no longer
have any freedom.

166
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:40,789
The more Nobunaga
behaves as he chooses,

167
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,875
the more trapped
you will become.

168
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:46,753
Please make things
easier on yourself

169
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:50,131
and unbind these fetters
that hold you down.

170
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:53,426
Your hair's a mess.

171
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:55,512
It's not a good look for you.

172
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,516
[KICHOU] At the same time,
there were turbulent shifts

173
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:02,811
surrounding leadership
within Mino.

174
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:06,022
Yoshitatsu had
inherited control of the clan,

175
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:08,274
but his disgruntled younger
brothers began planning

176
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:12,779
to oust him by raising up
the now‐retired Dousan.

177
00:10:12,821 --> 00:10:16,157
[KAEDE] Large upheavals
will likely come to Mino soon.

178
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:18,118
That has an ominous ring to it.

179
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,619
My elder brother Yoshitatsu

180
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:22,580
is cunning, resourceful,
and ruthless.

181
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,958
Nobunaga‐<i>sama</i>.

182
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:27,752
The question is what will
Dousan‐<i>dono</i>'s move be?

183
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:30,088
Still, though,
we should prepare.

184
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:33,341
[ATTENDANT] Excuse me, my lord,
Hidetaka‐ <i>sama</i> is here.

185
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:34,175
[NOBUNAGA]
Hm?

186
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:36,719
Uh, wait. My little brother?

187
00:10:38,847 --> 00:10:42,267
How unusual for Hidetaka to
come all this way to visit us.

188
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:44,853
I haven't seen him in ages.

189
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:47,730
[TSUNEOKI] Oh! They look
lively, swimming around!

190
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:49,190
Yeah, they do!

191
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:52,735
Oh. It seems the fireflies
haven't emerged yet.

192
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:54,028
But when they do,

193
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,989
I'll be sure to tell you!

194
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,741
And I'll be looking
forward to it.

195
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:00,994
[chuckles]

196
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:03,955
It appears he and Tsuneoki
have a great deal in common.

197
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:06,124
He knows I'm his brother, right?

198
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:10,628
Hidetaka‐<i>sama</i>,
stay right there.

199
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,589
Don't move.

200
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,053
[HIDETAKA]
A grasshopper?

201
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:20,972
Was it perched
on top of my head?

202
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:23,016
It was and looking
quite comfortable.

203
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:27,562
[laughs]

204
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,022
That reminds me.

205
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:31,149
From what I understand,
you've become a familiar face

206
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:33,276
over at the
Ikoma estate recently.

207
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:35,320
Huh? Oh.

208
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:36,112
Right.

209
00:11:36,154 --> 00:11:37,530
Then I suppose you've
already heard the news

210
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:39,115
about her remarrying.

211
00:11:39,157 --> 00:11:40,783
Huh? That's hard to believe.

212
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:43,119
She only recently
lost her husband.

213
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:45,288
[OHANA] He's apparently
a rich man from Sakai.

214
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:47,540
He took pity on Kitsuno‐<i>dono</i>

215
00:11:47,582 --> 00:11:50,001
and introduced
himself as a suitor.

216
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:56,591
[KICHOU]
1555.

217
00:11:56,633 --> 00:12:00,595
Saitou Yoshitatsu,
Lord of Inabayama Castle,

218
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:02,722
murdered his
younger brothers,

219
00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:06,351
purging the family of
any chance of divisions.

220
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:09,437
[KAEDE] You realize this puts
you in a perilous situation.

221
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:14,525
A rift is likely between the
Oda and the Saitou of Mino.

222
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:17,195
If so, your value
as a wife will be gone,

223
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:19,989
and your life may be in danger.

224
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:22,951
Dissolve the marriage
and come away with me.

225
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:24,953
Kaede, I...

226
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:28,998
Is it true
Dousan‐ <i>dono</i> 's fled?

227
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:29,916
Yes.

228
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:32,210
My lord is in Sagiyama Castle.

229
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:35,588
I never imagined Yoshitatsu
would make his move so quickly.

230
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:37,548
I miscalculated, damn!

231
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:40,927
We can no longer
consider Mino our ally.

232
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:43,429
We'll supply
Dousan‐<i>dono</i> troops.

233
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:45,181
And you'll guide them.

234
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:50,520
As things stand,

235
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:53,022
you're less a protector to
him and more of a burden.

236
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:54,649
[gasps]

237
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:58,069
[MICHITOMO] Has Nobukatsu‐ <i>sama</i>
still not made a decision?

238
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:01,239
With Dousan no longer a threat,
we can make allies more easily

239
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:03,449
and take control
from Nobunaga‐ <i>sama</i> .

240
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:05,368
He could try to hold
on to his position

241
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:07,745
by claiming he belongs
to the Principal Line.

242
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:10,832
Why are you taking the
longest route to the goal?

243
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:12,959
You realize there are swifter,
more direct methods

244
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,252
of eliminating him.

245
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:17,130
What you're proposing is...
it's far too drastic!

246
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:20,133
That would besmirch
Nobukatsu‐<i>sama</i>'s good name.

247
00:13:23,094 --> 00:13:24,679
[KATSUIE]
Hmmm...

248
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:26,306
That ambitious upstart.

249
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:28,725
His recent words and
deeds go beyond the pale.

250
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:29,684
He's been currying favor

251
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:32,437
with Nobukatsu‐ <i>sama</i>
and Gozen‐ <i>sama</i> .

252
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,231
He's shrewd, I'll give him that.

253
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:39,193
[NOBUKATSU]
I really do want to speak

254
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:41,362
with my elder brother just once.

255
00:13:41,404 --> 00:13:44,449
But considering how
sensitive the situation is.

256
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:47,869
Even getting a letter to him
is next to impossible.

257
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,370
[HIDETAKA RETAINER A]
Is that so, my lord?

258
00:13:49,412 --> 00:13:50,330
[HIDETAKA]
I swear!

259
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:52,040
I'm not making it up.

260
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:00,465
Careful, brother.

261
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,508
You mustn't touch it.

262
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,135
Right, I'm sorry!

263
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:05,303
I'm planning on taking it over

264
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:08,806
to show Ikeda
Tsuneoki‐ <i>dono</i> pretty soon.

265
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:10,391
[NOBUKATSU]
Funny you should mention that.

266
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:13,019
I hear you two have
become close recently.

267
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:16,022
Is something wrong with that?

268
00:14:16,064 --> 00:14:16,773
[NOBUKATSU]
No.

269
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:18,483
Of course not.

270
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:21,361
Actually, there's a favor
I'd like to ask of you.

271
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:26,366
Whenever you meet with him
next, bring this with you,

272
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:28,618
and pass it to Nobunaga.

273
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:33,081
A letter?

274
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:34,207
Yes.

275
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:36,167
Can I trust you with this task?

276
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:37,377
I understand.

277
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:38,628
Here.

278
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:39,545
All right.

279
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:41,756
I'll leave tomorrow
to deliver it.

280
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:52,725
[TSUZUKI]
So, you're having Hidetaka

281
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:56,437
become your connective link.

282
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:57,939
I see.

283
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:01,734
Both of his retainers are
old men, removed from politics.

284
00:15:01,776 --> 00:15:03,236
None of them would pry.

285
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:05,905
Quite a brilliant
plan, actually.

286
00:15:05,947 --> 00:15:07,115
You thought this through.

287
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:09,909
I should have figured you
would be opposed to this too.

288
00:15:09,951 --> 00:15:11,285
Quite the opposite, my lord.

289
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:13,287
I have no desire
to intrude any further

290
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:16,165
into your precious
brotherly ties.

You're free to do as you wish.

While it may not seem like it,

my only concern is
for your happiness.

00:16:57,975 --> 00:17:00,520
This isn't happening.

321
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:01,604
Look at him.

322
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:04,774
Look at your
brother's face, Nobukatsu.

323
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:07,235
It's still the same
as it ever was,

324
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:10,530
as though he's only dreaming.

325
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:12,281
Why would this happen?

326
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:14,575
Having my son taken away.

327
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:17,954
[sobs]

328
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:23,417
Take my mother
to her bedchamber.

329
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:32,426
What is that?

330
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:36,847
It looks like a letter.

331
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,891
I'll hold onto it.

332
00:17:38,933 --> 00:17:41,185
Hit by a stray arrow
on the hunting grounds.

333
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:42,645
Truly heartbreaking.

334
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:44,564
You two were supposed
to protect him!

335
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:46,315
[HIDETAKA RETAINER B]
Our humblest apologies!

336
00:17:46,357 --> 00:17:49,443
The arrow belonged to one of
Nobutsugu‐<i>sama</i>'s retainers!

337
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:51,904
So why has there been
absolutely no word from him?

338
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:53,114
[HIDETAKA RETAINER A]
He fled from the spot

339
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:54,615
as soon as he heard.

340
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:57,535
[MICHITOMO]
The coward.

341
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:11,007
[NOBUKATSU]
If only I hadn't sent him

342
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:12,883
with that accursed letter!

343
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:13,968
Hidetaka.

344
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:15,261
I'm sorry.

345
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:19,682
I'm the one who killed you.

346
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:25,646
[TSUZUKI] We both know
it wasn't your fault.

347
00:18:25,688 --> 00:18:28,774
It's not my place to say.

348
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:29,609
But the truth is,

349
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:32,570
earlier I heard something
troubling, my lord.

350
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:35,531
Apparently Nobunaga‐<i>sama</i>
refused to receive the letter

351
00:18:35,573 --> 00:18:38,784
your younger brother
was carrying.

352
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:41,579
He said it defied logic that
you'd entrust Hidetaka‐ <i>sama</i>

353
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:43,664
with important correspondence

354
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:45,791
and that you should
have delivered it yourself.

355
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:46,959
He wouldn't.

356
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:50,588
Your brother froze, worried
that he would disappoint you.

357
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:54,175
And then, that's when
the arrow was fired.

358
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:57,511
If Nobunaga‐<i>sama</i> had accepted
the letter from your brother,

359
00:18:57,553 --> 00:19:00,598
this could have been prevented.

360
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,518
This cannot be merely
written off as a tragic event.

361
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,813
Your older brother is the
source of our misfortunes.

362
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:11,275
He treats the fate of
the Oda clan as a trifle!

363
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:12,943
No! That's a lie!

364
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:15,029
He would never do such a thing!

365
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:22,161
[KATSUIE]
Nobukatsu‐<i>sama</i>!

366
00:19:22,203 --> 00:19:23,704
We found your brother's killer!

367
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:24,705
[HIDETAKA RETAINER B]
Death to Nobutsugu‐<i>dono</i>!

368
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:25,790
[HIDETAKA RETAINER A]
Let us take revenge!

369
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:26,582
[RETAINER B]
Nobukatsu‐<i>sama</i>!

370
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:27,958
[chatter continues]

371
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,127
Make your decision.

372
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:40,971
Begin rallying a force!

373
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:46,644
Such a piteous fate.

374
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:48,979
That poor child. He...

375
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:51,732
Ill fortune is all
that it can be called.

376
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:52,858
[ATTENDANT]
Nobunaga‐<i>sama</i>!

377
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:56,946
An emergency messenger has
arrived from Suemori Castle!

378
00:19:57,697 --> 00:20:01,158
[NOBUNAGA] Nobukatsu is going
to take vengeance on our uncle.

379
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,827
He wants reinforcements.

380
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,370
[ALL gasp]

381
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:07,373
A battle only for revenge.

382
00:20:07,415 --> 00:20:08,582
What will you do?

383
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:09,667
Will you send troops?

384
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:12,128
I'm devastated,
same as my brother.

385
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:14,880
Unfortunately, Hidetaka
had a lapse in judgement

386
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:17,758
and voluntarily entered
the hunting grounds.

387
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,176
What should I do?

388
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:21,554
Nobunaga.

389
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:25,141
If you raise an army,
it must be for a great cause.

390
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:28,352
Those who wage war
without one will fall into ruin.

391
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:30,855
Engrave this truth
upon your heart.

392
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:33,691
[NOBUNAGA]
They're two different things.

393
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:38,738
Honoring the memory of
my brother and raising an army.

394
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,832
Has my elder brother arrived?

395
00:20:49,874 --> 00:20:50,916
[HIDETAKA RETAINER B]
No, my lord!

396
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:52,376
It would appear Nobunaga‐<i>sama</i>

397
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:54,712
is intent on betraying
you once again.

398
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:57,173
Seems as though
his priorities lie elsewhere.

399
00:20:57,882 --> 00:20:58,924
You left us.

400
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:01,510
Your family.

401
00:21:01,552 --> 00:21:04,764
What about our
innocent brother's murder?

402
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:08,142
Do you care nothing about him?

403
00:21:08,184 --> 00:21:11,937
It's like father's
funeral all over again.

404
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:17,443
When I need you by my side,
you're never there.

405
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,821
[NOBUKATSU] What matters
most to you, elder brother?

406
00:21:20,863 --> 00:21:23,616
Because I have no idea anymore.

407
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:27,453
Only one thing is clear.

408
00:21:27,495 --> 00:21:29,038
You cannot rely on him.

409
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:30,289
He will never change.

410
00:21:30,331 --> 00:21:32,249
That's just the way he is.

411
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,417
Knowing this,

412
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:36,504
will you still cling to
brotherly ties, my lord?

413
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:41,509
I will never again
call you my brother.

414
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:46,430
Nobunaga!

415
00:23:31,994 --> 00:23:34,830
[TSUNEOKI] Frolic and play
as much as you'd like,

416
00:23:34,872 --> 00:23:36,582
Hidetaka‐<i>sama</i>.
