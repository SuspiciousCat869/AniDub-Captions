00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:24,733
Is there ever a moment's
peace around here?

3
00:00:24,775 --> 00:00:27,486
[KATSUIE] Nobunaga‐<i>sama</i>
brought in a musket specialist.

4
00:00:27,528 --> 00:00:29,780
Sounds like they're doing
some test shooting.

5
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:31,490
Hm? What do you
mean brought in?

6
00:00:31,532 --> 00:00:32,699
He's from Sakai.

7
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:35,369
Goes by the name
Takigawa Kazumasu.

8
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:37,955
Wow!

9
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:39,164
Well done!

10
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:42,876
Beautiful shot, Kichou‐<i>sama</i>.

11
00:00:42,918 --> 00:00:47,089
If so, it's only because I have
such an excellent instructor.

12
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:48,840
[NOBUNAGA]
There's more to it.

13
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:52,177
These models are lighter and
more powerful than the old ones.

14
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:54,680
Even women and children
will be able to wield these.

15
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:55,931
You aren't serious.

16
00:00:55,973 --> 00:00:56,890
Sure.

17
00:00:56,932 --> 00:00:59,268
The battlefield
is going to change.

18
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:00,519
Good work, Takigawa‐<i>dono</i>.

19
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:02,145
Keep improving on the design.

20
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:03,730
I shall, my lord.

21
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:06,275
[KICHOU] The weight's
a definite improvement,

22
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:10,362
and it would allow more people
to learn how to shoot a musket.

23
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:12,197
But the problem is with speed.

24
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:14,950
It still takes too
much time to reload.

25
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:16,410
I've got a workaround
and when you see it,

26
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:19,121
you're going to be amazed
at how simple it is.

27
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:20,414
[chuckles]

28
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:22,916
Did I say something funny?

29
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:23,875
It's just that I've never seen

30
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:26,587
this level of excitement
in you before.

31
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:27,713
Well, I suppose sometimes

32
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:32,092
when I'm around people who're
close to me, I get carried away.

33
00:01:32,134 --> 00:01:34,886
Just goes to show, you're
a part of our family, now.

34
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:37,139
[laughs]

35
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:40,809
[KICHOU]
Oda Nobunaga.

36
00:01:40,851 --> 00:01:45,480
When the world was at war,
he eclipsed it like a demon god.

37
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:47,899
Though much has
been written about him,

38
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:50,986
the man I knew
differed from the legend.

39
00:01:51,028 --> 00:01:52,404
Tonight, let me tell you

40
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:56,491
a bit more about who that
Nobunaga‐<i>sama</i> really was.

41
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:32,421
Five hundred?

42
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:35,340
Surely I didn't hear
you right, my lord!

43
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:37,175
There are a 100 from Sakai,

44
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:40,429
and a further 150 from
the Kunitomo smithy,

45
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:43,640
but I figure we still need
around double that number.

46
00:03:43,682 --> 00:03:45,225
Can we arrange for that somehow?

47
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:46,560
One moment, my lord.

48
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:48,729
I remain confused
regarding this request.

49
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,856
Why would we ever need
that many muskets?

50
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:52,566
Obviously to defend Owari.

51
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:54,151
Surely you jest, my lord!

52
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:56,069
Muskets are used as
nothing more than a ploy

53
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:58,196
to startle the enemy forces!

54
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,406
Five Hundred.

55
00:03:59,448 --> 00:04:01,032
While it's true that only
one won't do much more

56
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:03,285
than scare away
a flock of sparrows.

57
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:04,828
Imagine if we had 500.

58
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:07,330
We'd be able to drive away
even the Imagawa.

59
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:09,040
But our bows are sufficient!

60
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:11,334
If you know where to
locate 500 master archers,

61
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:12,919
I'm all ears, Katsuie

62
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:14,463
How do you expect
to pay for this?

63
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:15,172
As my retainers,

64
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:19,134
it's your responsibility to
figure out the how, not mine.

65
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:20,844
This is pure nonsense.

66
00:04:20,886 --> 00:04:23,388
I never imagined he'd
be this unreasonable.

67
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:26,224
[HIRATE] Leave the details
for me to sort through, my lord.

68
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,560
I, Hirate Masahide,
your loyal servant,

69
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:32,022
shall arrange for the
remaining 250 muskets.

70
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:33,398
Lord Auditor!

71
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,524
Do you think it's advisable?

72
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:37,235
Making such rash assurances?

73
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:40,489
A senior retainer's job is
to carry out his orders.

74
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,824
If the role simply involved
voicing displeasure,

75
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:44,743
an infant would
make a better choice.

76
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:46,828
Well, my lord?

77
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:47,996
It's settled.

78
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:50,665
I assign the task
to you, Hirate.

79
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:52,834
It would be my honor.

80
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:58,048
Why, Brother?

81
00:04:58,089 --> 00:05:00,258
Why do you continue
to allow that old sycophant

82
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,219
to give into the
brat's every whim?

83
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:05,222
At this point, Hirate‐<i>dono</i>
is the lord's only supporter!

84
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:08,517
We should oust him and force
Nobukatsu‐<i>sama</i> into power!

85
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:10,560
But instead, we continue
letting his foolish brother

86
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:11,978
destroy the Oda clan!

87
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,564
You should choose
your words more carefully.

88
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:17,317
None of us can hold
a candle to his legacy.

89
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:20,487
Surely even
you're aware of that.

90
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:23,114
When Hirate‐<i>dono</i> was younger,
he tore across the battlefield

91
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:27,118
as Nobuhide‐<i>sama</i>'s
right‐hand man.

92
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,205
Enemies could never get near
him thanks to the masterful way

93
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:33,333
he wielded a spear.

94
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:35,794
Outside of battle,
it was much the same.

95
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:38,129
No one outdid him in
governmental affairs.

96
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:40,799
In fact, all negotiations with
the Imperial Court came

97
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:44,094
to fruition because
of his diplomatic skills.

98
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:47,264
Now that I think back,
there was one incident.

99
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:51,017
A foreign ship had been caught
in a storm and shipwrecked.

100
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:53,937
So, Hirate‐<i>dono</i>
set off on his own.

101
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:56,398
They say he rescued
every crew member.

102
00:05:57,941 --> 00:06:00,235
[HIDESADA] The barbarians
he saved were so grateful.

103
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:03,446
Every one of them went
so far as to make a promise.

104
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:06,199
Should Hirate‐<i>dono</i>
ever require their help,

105
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:09,870
no matter the request,
they would come to his aid.

106
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:12,205
I realize you're
ambitious, Michitomo,

107
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:14,499
however, the prospect of
taking down Hirate‐<i>dono</i>

108
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,001
is virtually impossible.

109
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:18,420
Nothing can be done.

It's not about ambition.

00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:27,053
It's bigger.

113
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:30,223
This is about safeguarding

00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:24,462
Sorry, but it's a
secret investigation.

163
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:25,171
Oh?

164
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:26,172
Into what?

165
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:28,174
Actually, Hirate‐<i>sama</i>
is under suspicion

166
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:30,301
of pocketing Oda family assets.

167
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,387
I'm looking for proof.

168
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:33,221
[OHANA chuckles]

169
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:34,389
You're kidding.

170
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:35,640
I would never, my lady!

171
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:36,599
Take a look at this!

172
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:39,144
How would he acquire
these pricey tea sets?

173
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:40,687
Those are from my late father.

174
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:42,564
Every piece displayed
on that shelf is a reward

175
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:45,692
for his unwavering
loyalty and service.

176
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:48,361
They're rewards?

177
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:52,490
You may not know this, but
the man you're accusing doted

178
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:56,244
on Nobunaga more
than anybody else.

179
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:58,163
My brother was
a temperamental child,

180
00:08:58,204 --> 00:08:59,706
who everyone else wrote off.

181
00:08:59,748 --> 00:09:02,292
But it was Hirate who
served as his teacher.

182
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,960
Nobunaga only
knows swordsmanship

183
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:06,588
and how to ride a horse
because he taught him.

184
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:09,132
And back when my brother was
injured falling off his steed,

185
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:10,759
it was Hirate who
made a commotion,

186
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,970
insisting that he himself
was the one to blame.

187
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:15,764
So, you see...

188
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:17,223
Hirate‐<i>sama</i> loves our lord

189
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:19,642
like he was his own son
and there's no possible way

190
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:22,145
he would ever
betray his trust!

191
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:23,104
You fool!

192
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:25,148
You were manipulated too easily!

193
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:25,982
Enough.

194
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:27,609
Be gone.

195
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:30,195
[SERVANT A]
Sorry. Don't mind us.

196
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,072
[MICHITOMO]
What's going on?

197
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:34,032
[SERVANT A] One of
Nobutomo‐<i>sama</i>'s messengers

198
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:34,908
has arrived.

199
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:37,535
What? From Kiyosu?

200
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:40,830
[KICHOU] At this time, Owari was
governed from Kiyosu Castle

201
00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:44,334
by the Yamato no Kami house,
Principal Line of the Oda Clan.

202
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:46,669
After the passing of
Nobuhide‐<i>sama</i>,

203
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:49,631
relations between its leader,
Nobutomo‐<i>sama</i>,

204
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:53,343
and Nobunaga‐<i>sama</i>
were strained to say the least.

205
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:56,346
[MESSENGER]
The recent uprising at Narumi

206
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:58,723
has been exceedingly
regrettable.

207
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:00,892
Nobutomo‐<i>sama</i> asks
how you're prepared

208
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:03,978
to accept responsibility
for such an immense failure.

209
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,271
In other words?

210
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:07,857
If he's suggesting Nobunaga‐
<i>sama</i> commit seppuku,

211
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:08,691
he's mad!

212
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:11,152
He doesn't want
anything that extreme.

213
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:14,489
However, he is wondering if
Nobuhide‐<i>sama</i>'s successor

214
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:17,867
isn't proving to be
somewhat unreliable.

215
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:19,369
Uh?!

216
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:20,787
Him and me both.

217
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:22,455
My lord!

218
00:10:22,497 --> 00:10:25,125
[NOBUNAGA] I wish to ask
Nobukatsu's opinion as well.

219
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,919
If there's no further business,
let's break for the day.

220
00:10:34,509 --> 00:10:35,927
We must act.

221
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:37,971
It's political, not personal.

222
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:41,683
[HIDESADA] If the Lord Auditor
insists on ignoring us,

223
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:45,228
we can have the Principal Line
in Kiyosu replace the boy.

224
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,312
[MICHITOMO]
Uh...

225
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:48,731
I knew you'd think of a way.

226
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,659
Being reprimanded by
the Principal Line like that

227
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:01,744
casts him in a very bad light.

228
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:03,496
Wouldn't it be best
for everyone involved

229
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:06,374
if he allowed Nobukatsu‐<i>sama</i>
to replace him?

230
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,126
I agree completely.

231
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:10,170
Unlike someone
else I could name,

232
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:13,006
Nobukatsu‐<i>sama</i> demonstrates
a sense of decorum.

233
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:16,050
And he wouldn't force
impossible challenges upon us.

234
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:18,011
The Oda clan would have peace.

235
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:19,387
[HIRATE]
I wonder about that.

236
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:20,680
Huh?

237
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,225
[HIDESADA]
Hirate‐<i>dono</i>!

238
00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:26,644
If Nobuhide's line is
considered undependable,

239
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,396
you should ask
yourselves "Why?"

240
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:30,231
Could it be because
of his son's disposition,

241
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:33,526
or because a leader is only
as effective as the retainers

242
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:35,361
he keeps by his side.

243
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:37,530
Are you implying
this is our fault?

244
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:39,490
A missive was sent to Kiyosu.

245
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:42,619
And the author is
someone from this castle.

246
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,038
[HIRATE]
If we don't work together

247
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:48,041
for the sake of the Oda clan,
it will fall into ruin.

248
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:50,877
Be aware that even now,
Nobuhide‐kou's eyes

249
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:54,297
are gazing down on us
from the heavenly realm.

250
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:00,511
Pretty good.

251
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:03,181
[SERVANT A]
Did you hear the rumor?

252
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:05,016
Apparently
Nobunaga‐<i>sama</i>'s relations

253
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:07,685
with the Principal Line
have been shaky recently.

254
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:08,811
I heard they ordered him

255
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:11,022
to hand over control to
Nobukatsu‐ <i>sama</i> .

256
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:12,357
There's no way!

257
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,984
How could things
have gotten to this point?

258
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:17,612
How long have you been in here
and how much have you eaten?

259
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:20,615
[STABLEMAN A] Originally
this side of the family

260
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:22,200
was a subordinate lineage.

261
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:24,619
But then Nobuhide‐<i>sama</i>
eventually wound up

262
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:26,829
running the entire
show here in Owari.

263
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:29,123
Short version, the
Principal Line doesn't like it.

264
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:32,210
So hold on, this is
just about harassment?

265
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:33,461
They think they're so special.

266
00:12:33,503 --> 00:12:34,837
The Principal Line.

267
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:37,423
Owari's only at peace
because of Nobunaga‐<i>sama</i>,

268
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:40,426
meanwhile those
high bloods didn't do squat.

269
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:42,095
If they say anything
else about my lord,

270
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:44,222
I'll let them know
exactly how I feel!

271
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:46,599
You're a headstrong one,
aren't you, Inuchiyo?

272
00:12:46,641 --> 00:12:47,517
Believe it.

273
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:50,103
And I'd have no problem
laying down my life.

274
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:52,689
As long as it's for
Nobunaga‐<i>sama</i>.

275
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,065
[sighs]

276
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:56,693
[NOBUNAGA]
That so?

277
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:58,945
The kid really
said all those things?

278
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:01,072
Inuchiyo wasn't the only one.

279
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:04,826
I suspect that the entire castle
has been feeling on edge lately.

280
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:08,913
Truth be told, I've been feeling
a little bit suffocated myself.

281
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:09,956
Tsuneoki.

282
00:13:09,998 --> 00:13:10,915
What do you say?

283
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:12,208
Heh.

284
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,335
An excellent idea.

285
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:16,004
What're you planning?

286
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:26,014
Matasaburou wins!

287
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:29,475
What on earth are they doing?

288
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:30,727
Sumo, my lady.

289
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:32,729
Don't you have this in Mino?

290
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:33,771
Of course!

291
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:36,691
But what I want
to know is why sumo?

292
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:38,443
It helps blow off steam.

293
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,028
Whether you're just
watching or grappling,

294
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:41,988
you end up feeling refreshed.

295
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,364
Nobunaga‐<i>sama</i>!

296
00:13:43,406 --> 00:13:45,366
You should come over here!

297
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:46,826
[NOBUNAGA]
I think I will!

298
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:49,787
You mean you're going
to wrestle too, my lord?

299
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,789
[NOBUNAGA]
You better believe it.

300
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:55,501
And you can't win at sumo
unless you're using this.

301
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:58,171
[TAKIGAWA]
On the west side: Inuchiyo!

302
00:13:58,212 --> 00:14:01,799
On the east: Kazusa no Suke!

303
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:08,848
[TAKIGAWA]
All right, then.

304
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:11,351
If both grapplers are ready,

305
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:12,852
begin!

306
00:14:19,442 --> 00:14:21,027
[gasps]

307
00:14:22,153 --> 00:14:23,905
Almost! Keep going!

308
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:26,074
Pivot your hips, my lord!

309
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:39,837
[TAKUGEN]
Are you all right?

310
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:43,549
I'm sorry you had to
see this, Takugen Oshou.

311
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:47,178
It appears you've caught me at
a rather embarrassing moment.

312
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,554
It appears to me
you're suffering

313
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:50,848
from quite a severe illness.

314
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:51,933
Nonsense.

315
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:54,018
It's because of
this intolerable heat.

316
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,686
There's no need to lie.

317
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:57,522
Simply go and
inform Nobunaga‐<i>sama</i>

318
00:14:57,563 --> 00:15:00,108
that you're planning to
take a leave of absence.

319
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:02,735
I made a promise.

320
00:15:02,777 --> 00:15:05,947
One so important, taking time
off to rest isn't an option.

321
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:08,783
It must be fulfilled,
at any cost.

322
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:11,661
Perhaps, but if you
continue behaving recklessly,

323
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:14,831
it's doubtful you'll
live to see it through.

324
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:16,332
That's the price I'll pay.

325
00:15:16,374 --> 00:15:20,253
For the good of the Oda clan, I
would gladly sacrifice my life.

326
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:22,672
[SUMO C] Well done, my lord!
I knew you'd take him.

327
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:34,058
Sit down before you wear me out.

328
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:36,853
You ought to listen
to Yoichi, ya know?

329
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:39,063
Worrying can be
detrimental to your health.

330
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:41,441
How can I be calm
at a time like this?

331
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:44,193
I'm the head of the Oda
Yamato no Kami household!

332
00:15:44,235 --> 00:15:46,529
And when I dispatch a
messenger, how am I met?

333
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:48,364
With the sound of crickets!

334
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:48,990
[DAIZEN]
Hmm...

335
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:50,450
You'll agree, they
should be chastised

336
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:51,951
for their lack of respect.

337
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:52,994
Huh?

338
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:55,830
After all, you're the most
powerful man in Owari.

339
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:57,665
It sounds like they need
to be reminded.

340
00:15:57,707 --> 00:15:59,417
Sure, but brute force
isn't really how

341
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:00,710
we should go about it.

342
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:03,212
I'd prefer if we stuck
to diplomacy instead.

343
00:16:03,254 --> 00:16:04,630
What's wrong, Nobutomo‐san?

344
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:05,923
You're not scared, are you?

345
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:06,632
[NOBUTOMO gasps]

346
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:08,759
Nobuhide's son needs
to be dealt with.

347
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:11,179
And I'm afraid
there's no other way.

348
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:14,849
The Yamato no Kami line
has justice on its side.

349
00:16:14,891 --> 00:16:16,934
Worrying would be irrational.

350
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:22,231
[KICHOU]
August 15th, 1552.

351
00:16:22,273 --> 00:16:24,775
Pressured by his
retainer Sakai Daizen,

352
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:28,654
Oda Nobutomo attacked both
Matsuba and Fukada Castle.

353
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:34,118
He took Nobunaga‐ <i>sama</i> 's
uncle, Nobutsugu‐ <i>sama</i> ,

354
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,287
as a hostage.

355
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:38,039
[HIDESADA] The way of
the samurai is to keep faith

356
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,457
with one's lord.

357
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:41,292
At this point, I believe we
must show our allegiance

358
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:43,294
to the Kiyosu Oda line.

359
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:44,712
How can you say that?

360
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:47,340
Our one and only lord is
sitting in front of us!

361
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:48,591
If you truly believe in honor,

362
00:16:48,633 --> 00:16:52,178
we should defeat anyone who
opposes Nobunaga‐<i>sama</i>!

363
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,930
Mind your tongue, Inuchiyo!

364
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:56,432
Who are you to contradict
the Cavalry Guard?

365
00:16:56,474 --> 00:16:57,517
Michitomo.

366
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:59,310
Perhaps it slipped your mind,
but this spring,

367
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:00,770
I came of age, and my name

368
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:04,732
was officially changed to
Maeda Matazaemon Toshiie.

369
00:17:04,774 --> 00:17:06,317
And as Nobunaga‐<i>sama</i>'s
attendant,

370
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:09,529
I'll ask that you address me
by my proper title.

371
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:10,988
[MICHITOMO]
How dare you!

372
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,823
So what do you think?

373
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:15,451
Retaking both castles
wouldn't prove difficult.

374
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:18,204
However, the problem is
defying the Principal Line.

375
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:18,871
By doing so,

376
00:17:18,913 --> 00:17:21,999
I have no doubt we'll be
branded as a pack of rebels.

377
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,751
My thoughts too.

378
00:17:25,253 --> 00:17:26,462
[gasps]
What?

The old man!

380

He collapsed at Tsushima while
on his way back from Sakai.

There's no time to delay!

Please don't try to get up.

386
00:17:51,654 --> 00:17:53,364
You need to rest.

387
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:56,993
[HIRATE] I hear both Matsuba
and Fukada were captured.

[NOBUNAGA] An ear to
the ground, just like always.

I imagine you feel
conflicted, my lord.

Questioning whether
to stir up trouble

391
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:06,919
with the Principal Line
in Kiyosu or not.

392
00:18:06,961 --> 00:18:10,923
Heh. How do you see straight
to the heart of a problem?

393
00:18:11,674 --> 00:18:13,718
[HIRATE]
I have something to ask.

394

Please, will you listen
to my final wish?

395

Don't say "final." I'll listen
to any number of wishes.

[HIRATE]
Long ago.

00:18:21,392 --> 00:18:24,353
I made an agreement with
your father, Nobuhide‐<i>sama</i>,

398
00:18:24,395 --> 00:18:25,855
and swore that
I would devote my life

to teaching you all the
skills you would need

in order to be his successor

No matter who your

always fight your hardest.

for several years.

Even though I recommended
immediate treatment,

he insisted his commitment
to you needed to be fulfilled.

410

And giving his life was
a small price to pay.

Yes.

[YARAJ]
I've journeyed here

If you understand,
begin firing immediately!
