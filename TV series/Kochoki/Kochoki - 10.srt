His defeat in the recent battle

I know they're

She did?

When was this?

It must've been a few days ago.

107
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:02,464
To say that I was surprised
would be an understatement.

108
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:04,466
What reason would
Nobunaga‐ <i>sama</i> 's wife have

109

to come calling on me?

00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:13,141
But the more we spoke, the more
powerfully my heart was shaken.

111
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:14,392
[KICHOU]
For certain reasons.

112
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,978
I must depart the Oda household.

113
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:19,481
Unfortunately,
it coincides with a dire time

in Nobunaga‐ <i>sama</i> 's life.

Though we met only by
chance during that battle,

I have an earnest request.

What's the matter?

166
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,139
There's news of
my mother's health.

167
00:09:58,181 --> 00:10:00,558
Her condition's taken
a turn for the worse.

168
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,810
I need to be with her.

169
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:02,894
Youtokuin‐<i>sama</i>?

170
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:04,479
That's just terrible!

171

I'm setting out immediately.

Please, do not tell
Nobunaga‐ <i>sama</i> about this.

Why not?

174
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:12,362
Surely he'd want to know.

175
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:15,156
I mean, Youtokuin‐ <i>sama</i>
was his wet nurse.

176
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:18,493
It's too risky for him to be
making any long journeys!

177
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:42,934
So, you've approved
of my stratagem.

178
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:45,228
A wise decision.

179
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:49,607
The first stage of the plan
is proceeding as arranged.

[TOSHIIE]
Nobunaga‐<i>sama</i>!

It's Ikeda‐<i>dono</i>!

They have him!

183
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:12,630
A message was sent saying
Youtokuin‐ <i>sama</i> was near death.

184
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,924
He rode out to
check her condition.

185
00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:16,217
It was a ruse.

186
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:17,010
Damn!

187
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:18,845
Where is this Seikaku Temple?

188
00:11:18,887 --> 00:11:20,305
They demand I come.

189
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:23,808
We believe it's abandoned,

When an exceptional

a lord's fate suddenly
becomes precarious.

194
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:47,498
Ikeda‐ <i>dono</i> has been
bound and confined.

195
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:50,210
Now we wait for Nobunaga
and his companions.

196
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:52,545
They should be
arriving very soon.

Our forces,
led by Shibata‐ <i>dono</i> ,

will intercept them.

After that,
it shouldn't take long

to rout his hastily
assembled squad.

201

It's been some time

since I've seen you
so full of vigor, my lord.

I continuously supported you.

Without me,
you wouldn't have survived!

The only reason you're

of our innocent younger brother,

00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,544
[NOBUKATSU]
Shut up!

323
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:09,088
You want to know the truth?

324
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:11,215
Tsuneoki is dead.

325
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:13,092
He fell by Tsuzuki's hand.

326
00:18:13,134 --> 00:18:14,552
What?

327
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:16,596
[NOBUKATSU]
In exchange for his own life,

328
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:19,765
he begged us to
spare yours instead.

329
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:22,268
He died thinking of you.

330
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:27,523
A truly admirable death,
but ultimately in vain.

331
00:18:27,565 --> 00:18:32,570
[laughs]

332
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:33,821
Ready yourself!

333
00:18:33,863 --> 00:18:35,698
[screams]

334
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:44,415
[NOBUNAGA]
Nobukatsu!

335
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:47,543
[NOBUKATSU]
Nobunaga!

336
00:18:47,585 --> 00:18:48,836
Elder brother!

337
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:51,464
[NOBUNAGA]
My beloved younger brother.

338
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,957
[NOBUNAGA]
Nobukatsu! Nobukatsu!

339
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:27,792
Why?

340
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:30,544
Why did you halt
your sword strike?

341
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:31,796
[TSUNEOKI]
Nobunaga‐<i>sama</i>!

342
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:32,672
Tsuneoki!

343
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:33,714
You're unharmed!

344
00:19:33,756 --> 00:19:35,383
Is he...?

345
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:37,051
[KATSUIE gasps]
Nobukatsu‐<i>sama</i>!

346
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:39,553
Someone, treat his wound!

347
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:41,430
There's no need.

348
00:19:41,472 --> 00:19:42,139
It's done.

349
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:43,933
[NOBUNAGA]
Save your strength!

350
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:45,810
I've a request.

351
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:52,024
All that has happened,
lay the blame on me alone.

352
00:19:52,066 --> 00:19:54,151
I understand, but you won't die!

353
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,237
On me alone.

354
00:19:56,278 --> 00:20:00,408
Otherwise, these
wounds won't ever heal.

355
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:01,117
[NOBUNAGA]
Yes.

356
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:02,785
I swear.

357
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:11,877
[NOBUKATSU] I always admired you
and wanted to be by your side.

358
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,130
[NOBUNAGA]
I know. Don't speak.

359
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:20,678
[inaudible]

360
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:31,522
Elder brother.

361
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:34,567
Nobukatsu?

362
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:36,944
Nobukatsu!

363
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:41,365
This is what he wanted
from the start!

364
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:44,493
To end division and bring
the Oda clan together!

365
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:00,009
[gasps]

366
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,346
[NOBUKATSU]
I entrust this letter,

367
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:09,101
reflecting all of my sincerest
feelings, to Hidetaka.

368
00:21:09,143 --> 00:21:13,022
Though we are brothers by blood,
over the course of time,

369
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:18,152
I feel a great distance
has grown between us.

370
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:19,570
However.

371
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:21,197
I haven't lost faith.

372
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:24,658
[NOBUKATSU]
Faith that the two of us,

373
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:27,119
who once looked up
to our father

374
00:21:27,161 --> 00:21:30,915
and dreamed of becoming
just like him,

375
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:36,796
can bring our hearts together as
one and make a new beginning.

376
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,186
[KICHOU]
This was the manner in which

377
00:21:52,228 --> 00:21:57,066
the forthright
Nobukatsu‐ <i>sama</i> died.

378
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:58,275
In the aftermath,

379
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:02,029
Nobunaga‐ <i>sama</i> granted
Nobukatsu‐ <i>sama</i> 's final wish,

380
00:22:02,071 --> 00:22:04,782
and laid the blame
solely on him,

381
00:22:04,824 --> 00:22:06,575
sparing his
brother's retainers

382
00:22:06,617 --> 00:22:08,285
and bringing them
under his employ.

383
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:11,330
[giggles]

384
00:22:11,372 --> 00:22:15,292
[NOBUNAGA] Somehow, he
looks like my younger brother.
