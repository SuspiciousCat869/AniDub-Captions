1
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,789
[KICHOU]
Hidetaka‐<i>sama</i>.

2
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:42,960
You left this life immersed
in the joy of love.

3
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:46,088
Was that perhaps
a form of good fortune?

4
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:51,385
[KICHOU] After all,
you never knew the suffering

5
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:54,429
and sadness that
eventually comes.

6
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:59,226
Be glad, one and all!

7
00:00:59,268 --> 00:01:02,854
Nobukatsu‐ <i>sama</i> has
resolved to lead the Oda clan!

8
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:05,190
[RETAINER A]
Oh! A fine decision, my lord.

9
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:07,651
[RETAINER B] We were waiting
for this day to arrive!

10
00:01:07,693 --> 00:01:09,486
Obviously, we're overjoyed.

11
00:01:09,528 --> 00:01:12,239
Nobukatsu‐ <i>sama</i> possesses
the right temperament needed

12
00:01:12,281 --> 00:01:14,491
to succeed Nobuhide‐ <i>sama</i> .

13
00:01:14,533 --> 00:01:15,450
From this day forth,

14
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:17,911
he'll boldly name
himself head of the clan

15
00:01:17,953 --> 00:01:21,123
and work toward
ousting Nobunaga‐ <i>sama</i> .

16
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:22,666
Finally, we'll be rid
of your brother

17
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:25,961
and all his ridiculous whims.

18
00:01:26,003 --> 00:01:28,213
Indeed, with your help.

19
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:29,965
[RETAINERS]
Yes, sir!

20
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:06,937
[KATSUIE] This is
Nobunaga‐ <i>sama</i> 's territory.

21
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:09,523
If Nobukatsu‐<i>sama</i> occupies it,

22
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:12,359
that would send a message,
loud and clear.

23
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:15,445
We'll replace the leadership
with our own subordinates.

24
00:03:15,487 --> 00:03:17,155
Even if warfare breaks out,

25
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:20,951
we must continue to keep
our lord's name untainted.

26
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:22,828
[TSUZUKI]
Too indulgent.

27
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:25,414
We can't be selective
about our methods.

28
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:27,040
We should use coin
to amass supporters

29
00:03:27,082 --> 00:03:29,751
and allow them to loot, kidnap,
whatever else they choose.

30
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:31,545
But what are you saying?

31
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:33,422
Then Nobukatsu‐ <i>sama</i> 's
reputation

32
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:35,590
would be that of a ruffian!

33
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:37,759
In war, fathers may
see their sons die

34
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:39,553
and sons may watch
their fathers die,

35
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:42,264
but they must step over
the bodies and press on.

36
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:45,267
Even the Heike would
have escaped destruction

37
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:48,812
if they had adopted
the necessary methods.

38
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:51,523
He's trying this again?

39
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:54,067
His silver tongue is
the most irritating part.

40
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:57,028
What's your opinion,
Shibata‐ <i>dono</i> ?

41
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,322
[KATSUIE] It's for
Nobukatsu‐ <i>sama</i> to decide.

42
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:03,034
For now, we'll begin by blocking
passage on the roadways.

43
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:06,371
We'll prevent arms and supplies
from being brought into Kiyosu.

44
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:08,457
Thus isolating them.

45
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:28,477
I entreat you to grant us
victory on the battlefield.

46
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:32,647
I entreat you to grant
us victory on the battlefield!

47
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:43,450
Your hair is so
lustrous and beautiful.

48
00:04:43,492 --> 00:04:45,410
Up to now, you've tried
to maintain purity

49
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:48,497
in other regards, such as
governance and warfare.

50
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:52,209
You wanted to keep
to the side of good.

51
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,169
But with those standards,

52
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:57,464
you'll never be able
to defeat Nobunaga.

53
00:04:57,506 --> 00:04:59,841
You know the truth.

54
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:03,136
All things that
were pure and good.

55
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:07,140
Hidetaka‐ <i>sama</i> carried with him
to the Pure Land of Paradise.

56
00:05:07,182 --> 00:05:10,727
They no longer
exist in this world.

57
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:12,604
I am aware.

58
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:17,818
If Nobunaga is to be destroyed,
we must first become devils.

59
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:19,736
Tell me, Kurando.

60
00:05:19,778 --> 00:05:24,074
Devils, do they live
in a colorless world?

61
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:26,952
I don't understand.

62
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:29,621
[NOBUKATSU] I've never
heard of it happening before,

63
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:32,999
but since I've sworn
vengeance on Nobunaga.

64
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:35,377
My vision has changed.

65
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:38,255
It's a world of nothing
but black and white.

66
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:41,967
That's truly a
mysterious thing, my lord.

67
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:44,845
Seems thoroughly devilish,
don't you think?

68
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:47,389
[laughs]

69
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:49,850
[TSUZUKI]
That's right.

70
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:51,476
Become a devil.

71
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:54,855
Press ahead without
concern for your reputation.

72
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:57,482
[KICHOU]
On this day,

73
00:05:57,524 --> 00:06:00,443
Tsuzuki proposed the high
ground of Ryuusen Temple,

74
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:02,654
which was surrounded
by rivers and marshes,

75
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:04,698
be made the troop headquarters.

76
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:07,409
Nobukatsu‐ <i>sama</i> left the
overseeing of this arrangement

77
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,578
to his close confidant.

78
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,247
[TAKUGEN]
May I present Otsuru.

79
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:14,833
She serves as head
of a nearby village.

80
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:16,459
[NOBUNAGA]
What's this?

81
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:19,379
Actually, she says
there's a rumor spreading.

82
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:22,173
The villagers are convinced
that a war is imminent.

83
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:25,510
Everyone is feeling
a great sense of unease.

84
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:27,888
Please issue a
proclamation, my lord,

85
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:30,765
to spare our village
from any troop harassment,

86
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:34,185
violence, setting fires,
taking our homes.

87
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:35,520
Hold on, back up.

88
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:37,439
I've no problem
issuing a proclamation,

89
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,983
but what's this talk
about a war starting?

90
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:41,651
According to what's being said,

91
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:44,237
Suemori Castle
is attacking soon.

92
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:45,697
Nobukatsu?

93
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:47,908
Why haven't I heard
anything about this?

94
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:50,201
And who are they
going to fight against?

95
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:52,996
Imagawa? Saitou?

96
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:54,331
They're fighting you.

97
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:56,833
[gasps]

98
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:58,960
I can assure you
that's not true.

99
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:00,378
It's only a rumor.

100
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,005
Trust me.

101
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:05,342
I... I hope so, my lord.

102
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:07,427
I will issue a proclamation.

103
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:10,472
Whoever the intended foe is,
I will not permit any plundering

104
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:12,974
or setting of fires
in my realm.

105
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:15,060
[OTSURU]
We greatly appreciate it.

106
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:18,563
[TAKUGEN] I'm not convinced
this is simply a rumor.

107
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:20,982
There are several reports
that a large number of roads

108
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:24,277
have been blocked off
by Suemori troops.

109
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,071
Nobukatsu.

110
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,489
It's true.

111
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:30,075
[TSUNEOKI] We must
prepare ourselves for war.

112
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,326
It doesn't make sense.

113
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:34,913
Why would he wage war
against his own brother?

114
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:38,500
I'm going to meet
with him face‐to‐face!

115
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,168
[TSUNEOKI]
You can't, my lord!

116
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:42,295
Sentimentality isn't
going to help us.

117
00:07:42,337 --> 00:07:45,298
You must deal with betrayal
swiftly and without emotion.

118
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,092
Even if it's my own family?

119
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:48,301
Of course!

120
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:49,678
You're lord of Kiyosu Castle,

121
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:53,056
responsible for a great
many troops and common folk.

122
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:54,057
And a moment's indecision

123
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:57,894
would mean the loss
of countless lives.

124
00:07:57,936 --> 00:07:59,646
This is no time to
dwell on heartache!

125
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:01,815
A decision must be made.

126
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:07,362
If we're going to protect them,
we need to prepare now!

127
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:09,531
I heard you, Tsuneoki.

128
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:11,616
Ready our troops to leave.

129
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,001
It's a beautiful night, my lord.

130
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:22,585
The moon looks lovely.

131
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:26,214
I'm sorry, but I wish
to be alone right now.

132
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:27,799
All right.

133
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:35,015
[NOBUNAGA]
Nobukatsu.

134
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:37,142
Why would you do this?

135
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:45,775
Gazing at the
moon alone, my lady?

136
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:49,779
[KICHOU]
That explains it.

137
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:50,989
Poor Nobunaga.

138
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:52,949
He's in agonizing pain.

139
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:54,367
[TSUNEOKI] Telling him not
to wallow in his feelings

140
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:56,911
would be of no use.

141
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:58,580
Despite being aware of that,

142
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:00,832
you refuse to hold back
when it is necessary

143
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:03,918
to tell him hard truths.

144
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,879
Retainers usually
desire to be liked

145
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,089
by whomever they're serving.

146
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:10,967
But you aren't interested
in flattering him.

147
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:14,929
You only think of Nobunaga‐ <i>sama</i>
intensely, deeply,

148
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:16,514
with all your heart.

149
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,518
I'm unable to act that way.

150
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,855
Tell me, how do
I become more like that?

151
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:27,108
I believe our two situations
are entirely different, my lady.

152
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,693
And yet, they're not!

153
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:29,944
Even though we both adore him

154
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:32,655
and are continuously
by his side.

155
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:35,784
I still don't have
the resolve to tell him.

156
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:40,497
I was wondering.

157
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:43,541
This Kitsuno‐<i>sama</i>.

158
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,919
Tell me what kind
of person she is.

159
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:52,217
[TSUNEOKI] Someone

00:18:42,163 --> 00:18:46,959
So this is the reality.

322
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49,045
[laughs]

323
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:51,130
Leave this for me
to take care of, my lord!

324
00:18:51,172 --> 00:18:54,925
Ride to the safety
of Suemori Castle!

325
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:57,345
Where are you going?

326
00:18:58,387 --> 00:18:59,930
[TSUZUKI]
Fighting a lost battle?

327
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,432
Idiotic!

328
00:19:04,727 --> 00:19:06,228
Nobunaga‐<i>sama</i>!

329
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,189
It's your brother!

330
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:15,655
Nobukatsu!

331
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:21,535
Tell me!

332
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:22,620
Why are we enemies?

333
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:25,498
Why must you and I fight?

334
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:27,291
[TSUNEOKI]
Nobunaga‐<i>sama</i>!

335
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:32,505
[roars]

336
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:50,940
That's far enough!

337
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:53,567
[MURAI]
Seize him!

338
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,030
[KICHOU] Nobunaga‐ <i>sama</i> 's
army was victorious

339
00:19:58,072 --> 00:20:01,409
due to its resolve and unity.

340
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:05,746
Nobukatsu‐ <i>sama</i> ended up being
confined to Suemori Castle.

341
00:20:15,256 --> 00:20:16,173
[KATSUIE]
Nobukatsu‐<i>sama</i>!

342
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:17,258
You mustn't!

343
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:18,759
[NOBUKATSU]
Release me, Shibata.

344
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:20,594
[KATSUIE]
You'd leave us retainers behind?

345
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:22,596
I won't let you!

346
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:29,019
[GOZEN]
I beg you!

347
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:31,856
Please, let his
sentence be lenient!

348
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:35,067
Imagine if Nobuhide‐ <i>sama</i>
and Hidetaka were here!

349
00:20:35,109 --> 00:20:37,737
Surely, they would
have asked you the same!

350
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:38,988
Nobunaga.

351
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:40,489
Be merciful!

352
00:20:40,531 --> 00:20:43,117
This is a mother's
desperate plea!

353
00:20:47,121 --> 00:20:49,790
[TAKIGAWA] Nobukatsu‐ <i>dono</i>
deserves a harsh punishment.

354
00:20:49,832 --> 00:20:52,835
And his retainers should be
given the same treatment!

355
00:20:52,877 --> 00:20:56,255
We can't allow traitors
to be pardoned!

356
00:20:56,297 --> 00:20:59,884
[KICHOU] Nobunaga‐ <i>sama</i> was
pressed to make a hard decision.

357
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:05,347
[NOBUNAGA] There are a host
of things I'd like to ask.

358
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:09,185
But what's done can
never be taken back.

359
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:13,439
Many men were sacrificed
in the battle, on both sides.

360
00:21:13,481 --> 00:21:16,859
I never want to war
with my own family again.

361
00:21:16,901 --> 00:21:19,862
You understand,
don't you, Nobukatsu?

362
00:21:19,904 --> 00:21:21,197
Yes.

363
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:23,574
All will be just as you say.

364
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:28,829
[NOBUNAGA] The whole time, he
never once looked me in the eye.

365
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:30,998
You should have executed him.

366
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,626
Letting him live,
it's too lenient.

367
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:35,336
[NOBUNAGA]
I realize that,

368
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:38,214
but I'm unable to leave
my feelings behind.

369
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:41,842
Please, forgive me
this one time!

370
00:21:41,884 --> 00:21:44,136
I make this solemn
promise to you.

371
00:21:44,178 --> 00:21:46,764
This will be my only betrayal!

372
00:21:46,806 --> 00:21:48,599
I beg you!

373
00:21:52,061 --> 00:21:54,563
[KICHOU] Nobukatsu‐ <i>sama</i>
had his crimes forgiven,

374
00:21:54,605 --> 00:21:56,899
and it was thought
stability would return.

375
00:21:56,941 --> 00:21:58,275
However.

376
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:01,487
[NOBUKATSU] Not only did
I endure unbearable shame,

377
00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:05,157
now he's forcing me to
stay alive and wallow in it!

378
00:22:05,199 --> 00:22:09,245
[TSUZUKI] I know you're in pain,
but it's all right, my lord.

379
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:11,664
All you have
to do is stay alive.

380
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:14,375
Then you'll have the
opportunity you need.
