May 1556.

00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:25,943
Saitou Dousan,
along with his eldest son,

3
00:00:25,984 --> 00:00:30,322
Saitou Yoshitatsu,
fell to warring.

4
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:33,325
Though Nobunaga‐ <i>sama</i>
dispatched troops in support,

5
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:34,785
it was too late.

6
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:39,373
Saitou Dousan, the Viper
of Mino, had been slain.

7
00:00:42,793 --> 00:00:44,628
No, Father.

[gasps]

9
00:00:48,257 --> 00:00:50,759
Another dream
about Dousan‐ <i>dono</i> ?

10
00:00:50,801 --> 00:00:52,094
Yes.

11
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:55,973
In this one he was encircled by
a snake and engulfed in flames.

12
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:58,433
He never treated me
like his own child.

13
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:01,728
After all this time,
I still resent him.

14
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:02,938
Why am I hurting?

15
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:05,107
Despite that,
he was your father.

16
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:08,277
It's only natural you
would grieve losing him.

17
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:09,945
Kichou.

18
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:13,323
You said you were bitter
towards him in this life.

19
00:01:13,365 --> 00:01:18,078
And yet, when somebody passes,
they need to be forgiven.

20
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,290
Let go of the pain and
forgive Dousan‐ <i>dono</i> .

21
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:26,253
Thank you for that, my lord.

[yawns]

00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:08,939
Huh?

00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:09,940
What's the matter?

25
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:12,150
Let's hurry home
and get some dinner.

26
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:15,237
[VILLAGER A]
You've gotta be hungry too.

27
00:03:17,406 --> 00:03:20,325
[VILLAGER A] Why'd all the
birds stop chirping?

28
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,791
What else could go wrong today?

[VILLAGER A screams]

32
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:46,601
[KICHOU] Nobunaga‐ <i>sama</i>
continued to be plagued

33
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:49,771
by headache‐inducing
circumstances.

34
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:53,692
One situation involved Oda
Ise no Kami Nobukata‐ <i>sama</i> ,

35
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:55,861
lord of Iwakura castle,
conspiring

36
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:59,698
with Saitou Yoshitatsu,
to push Nobunaga into a corner.

37
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,909
Furthermore, Oda Nobukiyo‐ <i>sama</i>
of Inuyama Castle

38
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:06,037
began showing signs
of going his own way.

39
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:08,081
[NOBUNAGA]
Even though I don't want war,

40
00:04:08,123 --> 00:04:09,541
it doesn't seem to matter.

41
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,877
It's one thing right
after another.

42
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:14,796
All right, then,
let's hear solutions.

43
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:18,717
How about this?

44
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:21,052
Have you thought of something
ingenious, Toshiie?

45
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,053
There's a serpent.

46
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:24,556
They say it's in
Midori‐ga‐Ike Pond.

47
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:25,307
[NOBUNAGA]
A serpent?

48
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:26,266
Listen to this.

49
00:04:26,308 --> 00:04:28,101
Apparently this beast
is so massive,

50
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:31,980
it was able to drag a whole ox
under water with no problem.

51
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:32,856
Sorry.

52
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:35,734
And this is relevant
to our discussion, how?

53
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:36,526
It's not.

54
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:38,779
Then why did you bring it up
in the first place?

55
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:39,988
Hold on.

56
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,656
Kichou has had
a number of dreams

57
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:43,325
involving serpents lately.

58
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:45,744
That's considered
a good omen, my lord.

59
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:48,538
Perhaps it means you and
Kichou‐ <i>sama</i> can expect an heir

60
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:49,706
in the near future.

61
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:50,707
Huh? Hey, now.

62
00:04:50,749 --> 00:04:52,292
It doesn't mean
anything like that.

63
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:54,419
[TOSHIIE]
This is cause for celebration!

64

Not you too.

00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:56,213

Huh.

00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:04,221
[VILLAGER B] Have you
heard of the monster

71
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:05,931
living in Midori‐ga‐Ike Pond?

00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:06,723
[VILLAGER C]
Yes!

73
00:05:06,765 --> 00:05:08,850
They say that it
swallowed an ox!

74
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:09,935
[VILLAGER D]
You've gotta be crazy

75
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:13,063
if you think I'm going
anywhere near Midori‐ga‐Ike!

76
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:17,234
[NINJA A]
It's confirmed.

77
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:19,486
The rumor has spread
among the people.

78
00:05:19,528 --> 00:05:21,071
[TSUZUKI] Then everything
is proceeding exactly

as we planned.

Don't hesitate to spend
as much money

as you deem necessary
marshalling others,

82
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:28,537
so we can get this rumor
traveling all across Owari.

00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:31,998
I want to be absolutely sure it
reaches Nobunaga's ears.

84
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,333
Yes, sir.

00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:43,176

00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:48,390
I heard the good news!

Our family's getting one more.

90
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:54,020
First off, you don't
wanna eat too much kelp.

91
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:56,606
They say it can be harmful
to a child in the womb.

92
00:05:56,648 --> 00:05:58,191
This is starting
to get out of hand.

93
00:05:58,233 --> 00:06:00,652
Kichou dreaming about snakes
doesn't mean anything.

94
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:01,820
Your brother is right.

95
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:03,488
I'm not expecting a child.

96
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:04,698
You've got this all wrong.

97
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:07,033
Look, when a woman knows,
she knows.

98
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:09,494
Now, listen, to ensure the
stability of the Oda house,

99
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:12,289
an heir is an
absolute necessity!

100
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:15,250
So take care of
your health, all right?

101
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:28,179
I found it!

102
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,139
In foreign lands,

103
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,600
there's a giant snake
referred to as a "python."

104
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:34,936
This must be the source of
the "great serpent" uproar.

105
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:36,313
The most likely scenario

106
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:38,773
is that this python somehow
escaped from Yaraj

107
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:40,901
and took refuge in the pond.

108
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:43,904
What's wrong?

109
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:45,697
It's um, nothing.

Forgive me if
I don't believe you.

111
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:52,287
Is there really a snake
large enough to do that?

112
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:54,080
Swallow an entire ox?

113
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:55,874
You don't think it's a snake?

114
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:58,919
I don't know, my lord.

115

Are you still thinking

116
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:03,214
about what my

117
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,758
[KICHOU]
No.

118
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:07,260
[NOBUNAGA]
Then what is it?

119
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:09,095
I haven't borne a child,

120
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:12,557
and relations with Mino
have been completely severed.

121
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:16,770
There's no point in me being
here or staying by your side.

122
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,440
Do you truly believe that?

become the Defender of Owari,

125

At first our relationship
was purely political.

It's something else now.

131

[NOBUNAGA] Right.
I remembered the other night

the source of my bond

been estranged from you,

but if you could
improve relations,

144
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:21,418
it'd mean no more warring!

[NOBUNAGA]

I'm afraid we've moved ahead

without including you
in these discussions.

Sorry, but there's
no way to broker peace

except marrying you to Nobukiyo.

and become a bride.

On this occasion,

I know it all from the letter.

Are you Oichi?

162
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,553
Yes, my lord.

163
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:16,806
So, you're still
only a child then?

164
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:18,892
[NOBUKIYO]
It's all right.

165
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:19,601
Come over here.

166
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:20,643
Huh?!

167
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:22,103
[NOBUKIYO]
I told you to come closer.

168
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:24,272
Oh, of course.

169
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:28,401
A little closer, please.

170
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:30,528
[OICHI]
Yes, my lord.

171
00:09:33,031 --> 00:09:33,740
Ah!

172
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:34,532
A pity.

173
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:37,994
I can only describe
your looks as so‐so.

174
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:41,206
I apologize if they're
not to your liking.

175
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:43,917
[NOBUKIYO] Too early
for her to bear any children.

176
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:44,626
What?

177
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:46,419
Don't be nervous.

178
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:50,965
I can't leave Oichi
with a cad like you.

179
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:53,093
Have you no shame?

180
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:55,303
Why you...?!

181
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:56,638
[OHANA]
Hmph.

182
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:58,848
[OHANA]
I'm so sorry!

183
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:01,184
Nobody can blame you
for the way you acted.

184
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:04,646
Going by everything I heard,
I would have slapped him myself.

185
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:07,273
I shouldn't have put
Oichi in that situation.

186
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:09,359
How is she handling it?

187
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,360
[OICHI sobs]

188
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:11,903
[OHANA]
The poor girl's in tears.

189
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:12,862
I guess it's safe to say

190
00:10:12,904 --> 00:10:15,031
the engagement was
a complete failure?

191
00:10:15,073 --> 00:10:18,493
Since you slapped the guy
she was supposed to marry.

192
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:43,143
What exactly are you
doing out here?

193
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:45,645
I want to know the
name of your employer.

194
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:54,154
Have faith, my lord.

195
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:56,239
It's important you
don't give up yet.

196
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:57,282
You can rest assured.

197
00:10:57,323 --> 00:11:01,661
I, Tsuzuki, have already
taken the needed steps.

198
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:04,455
I swear I will
bring you good news.

199
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:09,419
[TSUNEOKI]
That talk about a giant snake,

200
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,504
it's no longer a joke.

201
00:11:11,546 --> 00:11:14,299
The common folk of
Owari are all frightened.

202
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,426
They're saying nobody
will go near the pond now

203
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:18,052
out of fear of being eaten.

204
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:20,763
As things stand,
we can't ignore this anymore.

205
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:22,432
I may have a solution.

206
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:24,434
If this great serpent
actually does exist,

207
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:26,186
then all we need to do
in order to capture it

208
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:28,271
is to drain the pond.

209
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:29,731
A brilliant plan, my lord!

210
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:31,774
Without water,
the snake can't conceal itself,

211
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:33,568
making it easy for us to catch.

212
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:34,986
This could be
just the thing to lift

213
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:37,697
Ohana and Oichi's spirits too.

214
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:38,406
All right.

215
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:40,700
We leave for the pond tomorrow.

216
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:46,998
Is that so?

217
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:06,184
[NOBUNAGA]
Hmm?

218
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:07,769
What's the matter?

219
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:08,645
[TSUZUKI]
Ah.

220
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:11,856
It's Nobunaga‐<i>sama</i>.

221
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:13,274
The rumor of this pond's serpent

222
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:15,902
has spread all
throughout the land.

223
00:12:15,944 --> 00:12:19,322
Nobukatsu said if
Owari's common folk were afraid,

224
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:20,615
then we ought to
capture the serpent

225
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:23,201
and put their minds at ease.

226
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:24,244
You don't say.

227
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:26,120
It's funny you
should mention that.

228
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:28,498
I was thinking
the exact same thing.

229
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:30,208
Where is Nobukatsu?

230
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:33,836
I'm afraid that my lord is
resting at Suemori Castle.

231
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:36,547
He took ill suddenly
and is convalescing.

232
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,091
Is that so?

233
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:42,053
Let's work together and capture
this beast for his sake, then.

234
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:43,221
Our retainers are working

235
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:46,140
to drain the pond of
its water as we speak.

236
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:48,101
Lend these men a hand.

237
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:56,109
What is this snake like anyway?

238
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,652
If it could swallow an ox whole,

239
00:12:57,694 --> 00:13:00,238
it goes without saying it
must be gigantic!

240
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,864
That sounds terrifying!

241
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:03,199
[OHANA]
It is pretty scary.

242
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:05,451
[OICHI]
What if it tries eating us?

243
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:06,536
What's wrong?

244
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:08,579
It's nothing.

245
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:09,831
Nobunaga‐<i>sama</i>!

246
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:11,374
This way, please!

247
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:14,043
You can see well into
the pond from this angle.

248
00:13:14,085 --> 00:13:16,004
[NOBUNAGA]
Right!

249
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:17,547
[gasps]

250
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:25,722
[KICHOU screams]

251
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:27,223
What happened?

252
00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:29,058
[TSUNEOKI]
Kichou‐<i>sama</i>!

253
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:35,356
[TSUZUKI]
It seems the serpent

254
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:37,400
isn't making an
appearance today.

255
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:39,235
Let's wrap things up.

256
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:40,403
Not to worry, though.

257
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:42,864
I'm sure we'll have
better luck tomorrow.

258
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:44,657
Hopefully, you can join us then.

259
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:45,366
Of course.

260
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:47,535
Until tomorrow.

261
00:13:52,707 --> 00:13:53,958
About what happened.

262
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,502
I wonder if it'll dry
by the time we get home.

263
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:59,380
Why did you pretend
to fall down earlier?

264
00:13:59,422 --> 00:14:01,049
Whatever do you mean?

265
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:03,968
[TSUNEOKI] I know you
tripped on purpose, my lady.

266
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:10,141
Keep it a secret
from Nobunaga‐ <i>sama</i> .

267
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:11,726
[TSUNEOKI]
Why?

268
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:13,811
There was an assassin here.

269
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,563
Really?

270
00:14:15,605 --> 00:14:19,025
Then this was planned
by Nobukatsu‐ <i>sama</i> ?

271
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:23,613
I can't say,
but if that's the case,

272
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:25,740
then I want to end this quickly.

273
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:28,117
Without my husband's knowledge.

274
00:14:28,743 --> 00:14:30,953
Hey! We're headed back home!

275
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:32,288
Come on!

276
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:33,790
[KICHOU]
Yes, my lord.

277
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:41,506
Man, everyone's snake‐hunting
at Midori‐ga‐Ike pond.

278
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:43,800
Why do I have to stay
and hold down the fort?

279
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:47,303
I would've killed
to see it in person.

280
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:49,472
I finally found you,
Maeda‐ <i>dono</i> !

281
00:14:49,514 --> 00:14:50,598
[TOSHIIE]
Huh?

282
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,391
[RETAINER]
I'm sorry.

283
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:53,184
It's Oda Nobukiyo.

284
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:54,394
He's here?

285
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:56,145
Direct him to
the reception hall!

286
00:14:56,187 --> 00:14:57,730
He was in a
highly agitated state

287
00:14:57,772 --> 00:14:59,899
and wanted to know
where Ohana‐ <i>sama</i> was.

288
00:14:59,941 --> 00:15:01,484
What did you tell him?

289
00:15:01,526 --> 00:15:03,361
When I said she'd
gone to Midori‐ga‐Ike

290
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:06,489
to see the serpent,
he rode in that direction.

291
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:10,118
[TOSHIIE] He wants
vengeance for that slap.

292
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:11,619
Who knows what he'll do.

293
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:14,330
He may even try
to kill Ohana‐ <i>sama</i> !

294
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:24,173
The weather's certainly
foggy today, isn't it?

295
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,885
[NOBUNAGA] We've nearly
drained the entire pond.

296
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:31,305
Soon the Serpent of Owari
will have nowhere to hide.

297
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:40,022
[TSUZUKI] It isn't the
right time to strike yet.

298
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:41,399
[NINJA C]
That wasn't us, sir.

299
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:42,692
[TSUZUKI]
Huh?

300
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:44,861
[KICHOU] So, they're
your men, as I guessed.

301
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:46,779
[TSUZUKI]
Reveal yourself, now.

302
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:49,198
[KICHOU] Pass this message
along to Nobukatsu‐ <i>sama</i> :

303
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,784
dispense with the
short‐sighted thinking.

304
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:53,828
Whatever happens,

305
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:56,956
I won't let you interfere
with Nobunaga‐ <i>sama</i> !

306
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:12,763
Well, now.

307
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:15,892
It's none other than
Nobunaga‐ <i>sama</i> 's honored wife.

308
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:17,351
Huh?

309
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:23,941
Is someone out there?

310
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:29,739
Nobukatsu‐ <i>sama</i> will be
Owari's supreme ruler, I swear!

311
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:32,867
[KICHOU] And I swear
to defend Nobunaga‐ <i>sama</i> !

312
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:36,287
[TSUZUKI]
I thought it was odd

313
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:38,956
when you stumbled near
the pond the other day.

314
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,416
Deceiver!

315
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:54,305
There you are!

316
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:56,098
You're hurt.

317
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,058
[KICHOU]
Why are you here?

318
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:58,100
[TSUNEOKI]
You're secret's safe.

319
00:16:58,142 --> 00:17:00,520
Nobunaga‐ <i>sama</i> hasn't

Isn't it laughable?

Never, my lady.

I've thought something was wrong

It can't be nothing if you

So, what about the python?

that he release the serpent.

To what do you refer?
