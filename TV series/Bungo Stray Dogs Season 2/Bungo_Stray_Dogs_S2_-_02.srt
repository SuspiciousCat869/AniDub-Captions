00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,083
[ODA]
Ango Sakaguchi...

2
00:00:15,625 --> 00:00:19,541
[ODA] Intelligence officer
of the Port Mafia...

3
00:00:19,625 --> 00:00:22,916
A man both accomplished
and mysterious.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,291
Truth is...

5
00:00:24,375 --> 00:00:26,958
...none of us know
very much about you.

6
00:00:37,958 --> 00:00:40,416
[OWNER]
How's the curry today?

7
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,708
[ODA]
The same as usual.

8
00:00:42,791 --> 00:00:44,458
How're the kids doing?

9
00:00:46,083 --> 00:00:47,791
The same as usual.

10
00:00:47,875 --> 00:00:50,583
They're all upstairs
if you wanna say hello.

11
00:01:12,666 --> 00:01:13,791
[ODA]
It's me.

12
00:01:13,875 --> 00:01:15,250
Coming in.

13
00:01:17,166 --> 00:01:18,583
How's it going?

14
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,125
You bein' nice
to the old geezer?

15
00:01:26,833 --> 00:01:28,416
[ODA]
Hmm?

16
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,750
[KOSUKE]
I've got ya now buddy!

17
00:01:36,583 --> 00:01:38,000
Wow, that was easy!

18
00:01:38,083 --> 00:01:39,833
Ya give up?!

19
00:01:40,416 --> 00:01:42,166
Looks like I'm gonna
have to show you guys

20
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:44,666
just how scary
the real Mafia is...

21
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,833
Do you surrender?

22
00:03:16,916 --> 00:03:18,458
Not a chance!

23
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:19,958
[ODA]
In that case...

24
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:22,541
It's time for some
Mafia-style torture.

25
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:26,041
[laughs]

26
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:28,958
Stop it!
I'll gonna die! Stop it!

27
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:31,750
Please! Please!
No more! Stop it!

28
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:34,750
It's too much! I give up!

29
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:40,375
We're all gonna get you
next time for sure!

30
00:03:40,458 --> 00:03:43,041
I'm looking forward to it.

31
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:45,208
[OSAMU]
This is too hot! Hah...

32
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:48,458
Did you add lava to it as a
secret ingredient or something?

33
00:03:48,541 --> 00:03:51,250
[OWNER] Odasaku gets
that dish all the time.

34
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:53,916
So, how'd things
go with the kids?

35
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,791
The same as usual.

36
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:58,208
Are those the orphans
from the Ryuuzu Dispute

37
00:03:58,291 --> 00:03:59,875
that happened two years ago?

38
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:03,000
You're a member of the Mafia,
but you don't kill anyone,

39
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:06,583
you have no interest in moving
up, and look after orphans.

40
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:08,458
You're a strange one.

41
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:11,416
I don't know anyone else
in the Port Mafia like you.

42
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,333
You're stranger than I am.

43
00:04:14,416 --> 00:04:17,500
Here, this should cover
the kids for the time being.

44
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:19,291
Sure you don't
want me to pitch in?

45
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:21,958
You really don't have
to foot the bill yourself.

46
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:23,666
You've already done
more than enough,

47
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,750
giving them a place to stay.

48
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:28,083
Long as I can eat
your curry whenever I want,

49
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:30,250
I don't need anything else.

50
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:32,250
You come here
about that "issue"?

51
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:36,125
Uh... Yeah... that's right.

52
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:38,416
I've come to the conclusion
that they're an organization

53
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,666
of gifted members from overseas.

54
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,250
They were chased
by a British group

55
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:46,000
called the Order
of the Clock Tower,

56
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:47,541
which prompted them
to make their escape

57
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:49,250
from Europe to Japan.

58
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:51,291
Why would a group like
that have gone through

59
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:53,375
the trouble of coming
all the way here?

60
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:55,458
It does seem a
bit out of their way...

61
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:59,000
Perhaps there was something
waiting for them here.

62
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:01,291
[ODA]
I suppose that's possible,

63
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:03,500
but there's one thing
that's been bugging me...

64
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:06,125
[OSAMU] You mean how skilled
the soldiers were, right?

65
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:07,291
[ODA]
Yeah.

66
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:08,916
[OSAMU]
They're all veterans...

67
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,416
According to my information,

68
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,208
the head of that organization
uses a powerful gift

69
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:15,875
in order to make
them all act as one.

70
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,916
So that's how
he commands them...

71
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,666
Is the boss already
aware of this information?

72
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,166
[OSAMU]
I gave him my report.

73
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:27,416
He asked me to develop
an anti-Mimic strategy,

74
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,250
and see to it that
it was implemented.

75
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:33,291
I've already set up
a variety of traps.

76
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,375
This might be a stupid question,

77
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:39,375
but considering the
group we're dealing with,

78
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:41,958
wouldn't this be a matter
for the government?

79
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:43,291
[OSAMU]
You're referring to the

80
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:47,458
Ministry of Home Affairs'
secret department, yes?

81
00:05:47,541 --> 00:05:51,166
The Gifted Operations Division
doesn't technically exist.

82
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,791
They rarely get involved.

83
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:55,583
[ODA]
And what about Ango?

84
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:57,875
[OSAMU] It's fairly certain
that he was responsible

85
00:05:57,958 --> 00:06:00,583
for leaking the passcode
for the storage unit.

86
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:06,416
[ODA]
Did he betray the organization?

87
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,291
[OSAMU]
Everything does seem to line up

88
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:11,416
if we want to believe that.

89
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:15,458
[phone ringing]

90
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:18,625
[OSAMU]
It's me.

91
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:23,625
I understand...

92
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:25,250
Hmph.

93
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:28,041
A mouse sprung one of my traps.

94
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:44,333
[MIMIC MEMBER]
Our info was right.

95
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:50,833
[MIMIC MEMBER]
What?

96
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:57,458
[coughing]

97
00:06:57,541 --> 00:06:58,916
Sleeping gas...

98
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,333
...damn it.

99
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:01,833
[gunshot]

100
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:10,208
[ODA]
This is an accounting facility

101
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:14,125
that the Port Mafia uses
for money laundering.

102
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:17,916
Three years ago, Ango Sakaguchi
was scouted by the Port Mafia

103
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,125
and briefly assigned here.

104
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:24,500
Their records
detail that history.

105
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:28,250
If you'll excuse me, I must
be getting back to my duties.

106
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:31,125
Don't worry about me.

107
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:32,791
It's really nice here.

108
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:35,583
Maybe I'll ask to be
transferred to this position.

109
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:37,541
[OFFICE CLERK] Every young
person who's ever said that

110
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:41,583
ends up running out of here
in less than three days.

111
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:43,750
It's just too dull for them.

112
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:47,708
But take as much
time as you need.

113
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:55,666
[ODA] I found some
information that bothered me.

114
00:07:56,791 --> 00:08:01,041
Two years ago, Ango went
to Europe on a business trip...

115
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:05,708
The purpose was to meet up
with a local stolen car broker.

116
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:07,000
That must have been

117
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:10,041
when he agreed to become
a double agent for them.

118
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:17,000
[ODA] This was the room where
Dazai and I first met him.

119
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:23,458
[ANGO] I'd appreciate it if
you didn't come any closer.

120
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:24,500
You reek.

121
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:26,041
[ODA]
Two years ago,

122
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:28,666
Dazai and I were put in charge
of taking care of the bodies

123
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,291
of organization members

124
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:32,541
who had died during
the Ryuuzu Dispute...

125
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:35,708
Do... I smell bad, Odasaku...?

126
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:39,166
[ODA] Primarily, we were
to recover their belongings.

127
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:41,500
If the police were
to find them first,

128
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:43,041
they could be used

129
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:46,333
to our detriment in accordance
with their anti-crime laws.

130
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:48,083
[OSAMU]
You must be new here.

131
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:48,958
[ANGO]
Mm?

132
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:50,666
Why don't you tell us your name?

133
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,500
It's Ango Sakaguchi.

134
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:56,583
Well, Ango... you're
a fascinating character.

135
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:57,666
Smelly!

136
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,166
Are you sure that
the boss approves

137
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,125
of what it is you're
up to right now?

138
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:02,541
And just what
are you insinuating

139
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,416
that I'm "up to" exactly?

140
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,458
That you're writing an
obituary for those who died.

141
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:09,250
Am I wrong?

142
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,625
He's writing obituaries...?

143
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:13,250
[OSAMU]
These are the three that died

144
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:16,625
during the attack on our
executives last night.

145
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:21,666
Kurehito Umeki, Shoukichi
Saegusa, and Miroku Ishige...

146
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,416
Umeki was a former MP

147
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:26,333
who was shamefully discharged
for killing a coworker.

148
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:27,958
Both parents are dead.

149
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:29,125
[OSAMU]
You're keeping a record

150
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:31,750
of their life events
and family history.

151
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:33,916
[ANGO] It's the least
that they deserve.

152
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,666
Every one of their lives has
to have had some meaning.

153
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:40,250
I wanted to do more
to remember who they were

154
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:43,375
than just chalk them up
as part of a body count;

155
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:45,291
to honor their sacrifice.

156
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:47,416
What did the boss
say about this?

157
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,541
I managed to convince him
to account for everyone

158
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:52,666
who had been reportedly killed
as a result of the incident.

159
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:55,000
He was very opposed
to the idea at first,

160
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:57,208
but he eventually saw great
value to the Port Mafia

161
00:09:57,291 --> 00:09:59,375
in keeping such
detailed records

162
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:00,083
[OSAMU]
See?!

163
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:01,708
Isn't he fascinating?

164
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:03,208
What kind of person

165
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:05,875
goes through the trouble of
creating such a unique job?

166
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:07,916
There's only one
way to find out...

167
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,083
Let's take him out for a few
drinks at our usual spot.

168
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:12,625
[OSAMU]
That's a lovely idea.

169
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:14,291
Huh?! I can't do that!

170
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:15,875
I have work to do!

171
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:18,750
[OSAMU] I think I know just how
we can get him to leave early...

172
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:20,416
If we hug him real tightly,

173
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,416
the stench will be
unbearable for him

174
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,125
and he'll have to call it day!

175
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:25,083
Let's do it.

176
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:26,583
Gah! Hang on!

177
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:27,916
This is my best suit!

178
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,125
You can't do this!

179
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:31,458
I'm gonna be
very cross with you both!

[shrieks]

181
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:02,916
I'd like a full explanation...

182
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,458
[CURLY] We were able
to capture the group

183
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:07,750
that attacked the casino using
the knockout gas as planned.

184
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,458
One of them committed suicide,

185
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:13,291
but we were able to secure
the others and bring them here.

186
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:16,333
We had planned to interrogate
them about their other members.

187
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:18,208
We even removed
the poison capsules

188
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:20,000
that were hidden in their teeth.

189
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:21,958
I already know all that.

190
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:24,583
I was the one who put
those plans in motion.

191
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:26,625
I'm talking about afterward.

192
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:29,791
[CURLY] Well... one of the
soldiers regained consciousness

193
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:31,416
earlier than expected.

194
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,541
Before we could restrain him,
he stole one of our guns

195
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:38,625
and took out his own comrades,
most likely to silence them.

196
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:40,625
Then he proceeded
to come after us...

197
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:44,083
That's when I stepped in
to take care of the matter.

198
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:56,791
Do you have a problem with that?

199
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:59,333
[OSAMU]
Now I understand...

200
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:03,083
Of course not, Akutagawa,
you defeated the terrible,

201
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:08,000
monstrous enemy, and protected
our comrades from certain doom.

202
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:10,250
That's absolutely splendid.

203
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:12,833
If it weren't for
your awesome powers,

204
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:14,875
our men would've
been utterly helpless

205
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:18,875
to stop such a fearsome foe.

206
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:21,208
Nothing less from
my subordinate.

207
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:25,166
Thanks to you, all of the
planning that I did is ruined.

208
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:27,208
It's a little hard to
get the enemy to talk

209
00:12:27,291 --> 00:12:29,625
when they're not breathing,

210
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:32,375
and now the trail's gone cold.

211
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:35,125
If even only one of
them had been left alive,

212
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:37,875
we might have uncovered
important information

213
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:41,375
their headquarters, motive,
their commander's background,

214
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:44,666
and the powers they use to
command the organization.

215
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,291
"Uncover information"?!

216
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:49,000
Do you really think that I would
go through the trouble of--

217
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:56,041
[OSAMU] If you thought
I was going to be appeased

218
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:58,500
with some excuse, I apologize...

219
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:02,500
...but you're sadly mistaken.

220
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:05,291
Hand me your gun.

221
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:06,958
My friend, Odasaku...

222
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:10,416
He's working hard to take care
of some orphans at the moment.

00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,916
[AKUTAGAWA coughs]

224
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,833
[OSAMU] If he had been the
one to find you in the slums,

225
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:16,041
he would've taken you in
and done all he could

226
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:18,125
to see that you
were brought up right.

227
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:21,166
Because he's a virtuous person.

228
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:22,500
Regretfully for you,

229
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:25,833
I'm not interested in
virtue or saving anyone.

230
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:29,166
I'm only interested in results.

231
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:31,458
And you are useless to me.

232
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:41,708
Well!

233
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:45,083
[OSAMU]
Would you look at that...

234
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:50,375
How many times
have I told you...?

235
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:55,166
Your powers have far greater use
than that of a simple butcher.

236
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:59,083
You're capable of using
them for defense as well.

237
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:01,166
But I've never used
my powers like that before!

238
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,958
[OSAMU]
Well, you just did, didn't you?

239
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:06,375
Isn't that great?

240
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:09,166
Just remember this...

241
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:12,375
Next time I won't be so kind.

Got it?

243
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:17,166
[OSAMU]
Now then,

244
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,333
we should check the
bodies of the hostages.

245
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:20,750
We might find something.

[CURLY]
Sir...

247
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:23,375
what should we be looking for?

248
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:25,125
[OSAMU]
Anything and everything...

249
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:27,833
Whatever might trace
back to their hideout.

250
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:30,125
Their pocket lint,
the soles of their shoes,

251
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:31,583
any foreign bodies...

252
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:33,583
All of these could be clues.

253
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:34,625
Come on...

254
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:36,458
Being in the
Port Mafia means more

255
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:39,541
than just knowing how
to beat someone to death.

256
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:43,750
At this rate, Odasaku might
figure this all out on his own.

257
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:46,416
I'm aware of the
individual that you speak of.

258
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,000
Despite being in the Mafia,

259
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:50,875
they say he lacks
the guts to kill anyone.

260
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:54,833
It's hard to imagine a person
like that being your associate.

261
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:57,083
[OSAMU] You've made
two errors of judgment.

262
00:14:57,166 --> 00:14:58,000
Huh?

263
00:14:58,083 --> 00:14:59,375
[OSAMU]
Guts have nothing to do

264
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:02,083
with who we
should associate with.

265
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:04,208
The other is a warning...

266
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:07,416
If you value your own
safety, remember this:

267
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,083
Don't make him angry.

268
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:11,750
If he ever was to
become truly incensed,

269
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:13,583
I can assure
you without a doubt

270
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:16,541
all of us would be dead
within the blink of an eye.

When Odasaku unleashes,

272
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:21,458
he's more terrifying than
any Port Mafia member.

273
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:22,750
You could never hope
to defeat him

That can't be...

that everything is
cleaned up here.

Could we meet up and talk?

It's about the

Yup.

[OSAMU]
Not verbally,

00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:09,208
but we were able to
get results from a dried leaf

that was stuck to the
bottom of one of their shoes.

that infiltrated Mimic.

315

The reason that those guys
were staking out your room

with sniper rifles was to make
sure that the pistol hidden

318
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:27,625
Some might wonder
why they weren't just sent

319
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:30,833
to the boss's hideout
to assassinate him.

320
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:32,500
That's because you lied

321
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:36,541
and told them you didn't
know of his location.

322
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:38,958
Which information
you decided to give up

323
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:41,375
and which you
decided to withhold,

324
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:44,583
it was all predetermined
by the boss.

325
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:46,750
[ANGO]
You need to get out of here...

326
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:48,125
Huh?

327
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:50,541
For all my planning,
I really screwed this one up.

328
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:52,416
They've set up a host
of timed explosives

329
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,291
all throughout this building.

330
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:56,083
They want to send
me straight to Hell

331
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:58,125
for being the traitor that I am!

332
00:17:58,208 --> 00:17:59,333
[ODA]
You see?

333
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:02,083
It looks like you do
need my help after all.

334
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:08,333
[ODA]
Let's go...

335
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:10,375
How much longer 'til
the bombs go off?

336
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:13,291
Your powers can answer
that question better than I can.

337
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:16,583
if only they were
as convenient as that...

338
00:18:16,666 --> 00:18:20,291
At least...
our time's not up yet!

339
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:32,750
[ANGO]
Odasaku?

340
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:39,416
Ready to jump?

341
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,250
What?!

342
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:52,083
[ANGO pants]

343
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:53,708
[ODA]
You all right?

344
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:57,250
All this excitement is a
little too much for me.

345
00:18:57,333 --> 00:19:00,500
Still... thanks for saving me.

346
00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:03,375
So how much of this
does the boss know?

347
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:05,333
[ANGO]
Nearly everything.

348
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:06,708
The boss was the only person

349
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:09,458
who knew about
me infiltrating Mimic.

350
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:11,458
[ODA] So the reason
he had me look for you

351
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:13,625
was to cover his ass.

352
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:16,500
He knew that I'd agree
to go searching for you,

353
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:18,375
while still being
kept in the dark.

354
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:20,250
[ANGO]
I need to report to him.

355
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:22,583
The head of Mimic is
extremely dangerous.

356
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:25,291
He plans to crush
the Port Mafia.

357
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:27,541
Who is this individual?

358
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:30,166
The name of
their leader is Gide.

359
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:32,375
He has a very powerful gift.

360
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:34,875
We mustn't fight against him.

361
00:19:34,958 --> 00:19:37,750
Especially you, Odasaku.

362
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:38,791
[ODA]
Hmm?

363
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:40,833
The pistol that
was in that safe...

364
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:43,333
It serves as a type of emblem.

365
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:45,708
It has a unique carving
in the cocking piece,

366
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:49,666
which proves that its owner
is a member of Mimic.

367
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:52,000
What the hell is Mimic, anyway?

368
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:54,541
[ANGO] They are the
remnants from the War.

369
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:57,875
They only know how
to live on the battlefield.

370
00:19:57,958 --> 00:20:02,166
Even now, what they
endured in the war haunts them.

371
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:05,708
Odasaku... what's that...?

372
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:16,291
A ball?

373
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:33,666
This is bad...

374
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:38,166
It's poison...

375
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:39,791
My ability, Flawless,

376
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:43,500
allows me to see several
seconds into the future.

377
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:47,041
However, it can't help me
if I've already fallen

378
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:51,458
for the trap by the time
I sense the danger.

379
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:55,416
Whoever set this up knew
how my powers worked.

380
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:02,083
[ODA]
Ango... Run...

381
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:04,458
[ANGO]
Odasaku...

382
00:21:04,541 --> 00:21:07,750
Everything that I told you about
Mimic just now is the truth,

383
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:09,708
every last bit of it.

384
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:13,125
I didn't lie to you about that.

385
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:16,750
You have my sincerest
gratitude for saving me.

386
00:21:16,833 --> 00:21:18,458
Farewell.

387
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:24,583
I wish that I could've gone
drinking with you and Dazai

388
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:29,750
at our usual spot like we
used to just one last time...

389
00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:44,708
[ANGO] Are you aware that there
are people who actually think

390
00:21:44,791 --> 00:21:48,416
you guys use your special
abilities to seduce women?

391
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,875
[OSAMU]
Yeah, they don't understand

392
00:21:50,958 --> 00:21:54,000
that even if we wanted to,
it wouldn't work.

393
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:57,208
They'd just get creeped out,
and we'd fuzz it all up.

394
00:21:57,291 --> 00:21:58,958
[ANGO chuckles]
"Fuzz it up"?

395
00:21:59,041 --> 00:22:02,250
That's right... We'd fuzz it up.

396
00:22:04,291 --> 00:22:08,583
[ODA coughs]

397
00:22:08,666 --> 00:22:11,958
Sorry... Dazai...

398
00:22:12,041 --> 00:22:16,000
Looks like I... fuzzed up...

399
00:23:47,833 --> 00:23:49,125
[GIDE]
We are Mimic.

400
00:23:49,208 --> 00:23:52,708
An army of criminals
forsaken by God.

401
00:23:52,791 --> 00:23:54,875
Fight me, Sakunosuke.

402
00:23:54,958 --> 00:23:59,041
You and you alone are
capable of purifying my soul.

403
00:23:59,125 --> 00:24:01,541
[ODA]
No... I don't kill people.

404
00:24:01,625 --> 00:24:03,166
[GIDE]
I wonder if you'll feel the same

405
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:06,041
after I show you the
hell inside my head.

406
00:24:06,125 --> 00:24:08,041
[ODA]
Someday, I wanna be able

407
00:24:08,125 --> 00:24:10,666
to just sit at my desk, and...

408
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:12,958
Next on <i>Bungo Stray Dogs,</i>
