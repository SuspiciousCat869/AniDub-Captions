Kyouka, if you would prefer,

I can arrange for you
to be an assassin

isn't what they're best at?

Of course it is.

I overheard the situation.

Even if the Moby Dick can't
be stopped from falling,

79
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:28,083
we can destroy it
prematurely, making it crash

before it reaches the city.

your escape as well.

chained to the floor.

it to the evacuation system.

any ray of hope left for me.

97
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:14,750
But today, I finally
understood something.

98
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:17,875
I still have the power
to make a choice.

99
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:21,041
If I sacrifice myself
in order save everyone,

100
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:24,750
I'd also pass the entrance
exam in the process.

101
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:27,791
I'd become a real
member of the Agency.

That's something
I'd never regret.

Kyouka... What a little fool.

114
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,750
If she hadn't embraced the hope
of living in the world of light,

115
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:43,458
she would still be alive now.

116

we had hoped for, Atsushi.

President?!

120
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:56,291
[OSAMU]
Kyouka conquered her demons

121
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:58,416
and saved this city from harm.

122
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:02,125
She demonstrated the virtues
expected of the Agency.

123
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,166
[ATSUSHI]
But I-I still don't understand.

124
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:06,500
Why did she have to die?!

125
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:09,750
[OSAMU] I'll admit, the
process seems merciless.

126
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:14,833
However, there's a reason all of
this had to play out this way.

127
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:19,041
My ability is called
All Men Are Created Equal.

128
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:24,250
Its field of range applies only
to members of the Agency.

129
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:26,625
[OSAMU] His ability
allows an individual gifted

130
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:30,125
greater control of
their own ability.

131
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:32,416
The reason you're able
to control your weretiger

132
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:37,000
abilities now is because
you joined the Agency.

133
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:41,375
Kyouka was able to pass the test
and become an official member.

134
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:44,083
Right before the impact.

135
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:46,333
Do you see what I'm getting at?

136
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:51,500
[gasps]

137
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:54,250
Using Demon Snow's blade,

138
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:58,833
I was able to cut
the chain and escape.

139
00:09:58,916 --> 00:10:00,875
So I'm back.

140
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:08,541
[ATSUSHI]
Welcome back.

141
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:09,750
[KYOUKA]
You're hurting me.

142
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:11,833
[ATSUSHI]
Ah! Uh... My bad.

143
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:15,791
[OSAMU] Sorry we had to keep
it a secret from you both.

144
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:17,500
But if we hadn't,
it wouldn't have made

145
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:19,916
for a proper entrance
exam, now would it?

146
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
[gasps]

147
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:23,583
[OSAMU]
Will we end up in the mountains?

148
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:25,541
The sea.

149
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,166
Roger that.

150
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:31,208
Did you guys... plan
this from the beginning?

151
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:35,458
The enemy's been defeated, and
Kyouka's back, safe and sound.

152
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:37,208
Isn't that all that
matters right now?

153
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:38,541
Wait, Dazai!

154
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:39,791
What about me?

155
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:43,125
After that final battle,
do you think I'm strong?

156
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:44,333
[OSAMU]
Let's see now,

157
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:46,625
you did help take out Francis.

158
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:49,666
But you look like you're about
to fall over from exhaustion.

159
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,583
Does that really matter?

160
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:53,541
I still won!

161
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:56,958
You have become strong.

162
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:05,750
[OSAMU]
Oops...

163
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:11,958
[OSAU]
It's a nice view, isn't it?

164
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:19,625
This is your city, Atsushi.

165
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:23,916
You saved it.

166
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:34,125
[ATSUSHI]
Is this my city... really?

167
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:39,666
[ANGO] The war amongst
the gifted may be over

168
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:43,166
but it caused enormous
damage in Yokohama.

169
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:46,500
Now, the government's work
is just getting started.

170
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:49,291
Cleaning up after
such a huge mess.

171
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,500
I don't think I'll be sleeping
at home for days.

172
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:55,000
Setting all that aside
for now however,

173
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:56,708
have you considered our request

174
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:59,208
for your assistance,
Mr. Melville?

175
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:01,833
It would be very
much appreciated.

176
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:04,875
[MELVILLE] I just want
to watch the sea for now.

177
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:07,875
Your information would
help us out a great deal.

178
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:10,000
We wouldn't even have
to arrest any Guild members

179
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:12,833
who weren't
involved with that plot.

180
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:16,208
[MELVILLE] Do you really think
a mere grunt such as myself

181
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:18,208
would have that
kind of information?

182
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:19,833
Yes, I do.

183
00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:25,666
Because a long time ago, you
were the leader of the Guild.

184
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,708
[MELVILLE] I wish that
you young'uns wouldn't

185
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:30,333
insist on bringing up the past.

186
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:33,916
You would save me a lot of
sleepless nights by cooperating.

187
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,875
And I'd rather not
have to use these.

188
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:39,208
[MELVILLE sighs]

189
00:12:57,166 --> 00:13:00,375
[TWAIN] I never imagined that
ship would end up underwater.

190
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:01,458
It's a shame.

191
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:02,958
I was comfortable there.

192
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:04,666
[STEINBECK]
On the Moby Dick?

193
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:05,916
[TWAIN]
In the Guild.

194
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Now that the boss
is missing in action,

195
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:10,416
I hear all sorts of
insurgencies have sprouted up

196
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,000
within the group.

197
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:15,250
It was all fun while it lasted,

198
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:17,708
but it's time to bid
a kind goodbye.

199
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:19,458
Yeah.

200
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:21,666
Life goes on like
it always does.

201
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:24,500
[TWAIN sighs]
That's true.

202
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:28,000
Well, I'm gonna go back home and
finish workin' on my biography.

203
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:29,375
What about you two?

204
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:33,375
I'm going to look
for Lord Francis.

205
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:35,291
I'm sure he's alive...

206
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:36,750
Hmm...

207
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:39,708
Guess you're gonna go back
to your family, right, John?

208
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:41,041
Not just yet.

209
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:42,375
Huh?

210
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:45,000
I have to stop the revolts
happening in the Guild.

211
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:45,958
Come again?!

212
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:48,208
Heh. That's a surprise.

213
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:51,416
And here I was thinkin' that
you hated the boss's guts.

214
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,958
[STEINBECK]
I do.

215
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:56,500
I hate anyone who uses
money to control people.

216
00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:59,541
But he depended on
his wealth to save his family,

217
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:02,875
and unfortunately for him,
this was the result.

218
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:05,958
I can't leave things
on this note.

219
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:08,625
[LOVECRAFT]
The contract...

220
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:12,208
[LOVECRAFT]
...it is finally fulfilled.

221
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:14,666
Still kickin', huh, Lovecraft?

222
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:17,125
What are you gonna do now?

223
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:22,291
Go to sleep.

224
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:30,083
[TWAIN]
Just who was that guy?

225
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:32,333
[STEINBECK]
Does it really matter?

226
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:35,791
All I know is he's
one of my few friends.

227
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:43,250
Hey, Kyouka...

228
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:46,708
...after you.

229
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:04,875
[RAMPO]
One, two...!

230
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:06,625
Congratulations!

231
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:09,041
Welcome to the Agency!

232
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:14,666
[ALL]
Cheers!

233
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:37,625
[DOPPO]
Atsushi.

234
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:39,333
How are your injuries?

235
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:41,416
[ATSUSHI]
Oh, I'm all better now.

236
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,125
Because of your heroic actions,

237
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:45,500
this city was saved
from destruction.

238
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:46,916
As your senior,

239
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,583
there's something very
important I wanted to tell you.

240
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:54,750
First of all, despite the fact

241
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:56,958
that you engaged in a solo
operation, I will remind you

242
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:59,000
that we typically conduct
our missions in teams!

243
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,875
Also, I expect you to be
an upstanding gentleman

244
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:03,000
towards Kyouka now that she'll
be working closely with us!

245
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:05,083
Don't let me catch you doing
anything shameful towards her,

246
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:06,250
do you hear me?! I know...

247
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:08,166
[AKIKO] Give it a rest,
Sargent Buzzkill.

248
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:10,666
Leave the poor
kids alone, will ya?

249
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:13,708
Why don't you come
have a drink with me?

250
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:16,250
[DOPPO]
I'm not sure that's a good idea.

251
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:20,375
Wasn't there something
else you wanted to tell them?

252
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:23,416
You did well, the both of you.

253
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:26,708
[AKIKO] All right,
let's drink the night away!

254
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:28,166
[DOPPO]
Hang on a moment!

255
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:30,250
[AKIKO] Are you gonna leave
me high and dry, Kunikida?

256
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:31,666
[ATSUSHI]
An "upstanding gentleman"

257
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:34,041
would probably apologize.

258
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:37,875
[ATSUSHI]
Haruno... Naomi...

259
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:39,958
[BOTH]
Huh?

260
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:41,708
Please forgive me!

261
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:42,875
[BOTH]
Uh?

262
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:45,500
I know that I was
under Q's curse,

263
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:47,833
but I did some
awful things to you both.

264
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:50,208
If I'd had more control
over my emotions,

265
00:16:50,291 --> 00:16:52,208
that never would have happened.

266
00:16:54,541 --> 00:16:57,416
[BOTH]
Ohh! Now I remember!

267
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,500
[ATSUSHI]
I'm sorry.

268
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:02,208
Will you ever forgive me?

269
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:05,708
[KIRAKO] Atsushi, you don't have
to worry about that anymore.

270
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:08,208
All of that stuff's
already in the past now.

271
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:09,791
A-Are you sure?

272
00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:11,083
We're sure.

273
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:13,833
Thank goodness.

274
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:16,208
I really do feel
terrible about it.

275
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:20,375
I can't believe he was able to
get me to do all those things.

276
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:22,958
[JUNICHIROU]
Atsushi...

277
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:26,208
This is the first time
I'm hearing about all this.

278
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:28,833
What exactly did
you do to Naomi?

279
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:30,166
[ATSUSHI]
W-Wait a minute, calm down...

280
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:31,791
Oh, Rampo?

281
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:35,625
I brought over the new piece you
asked about over the phone.

282
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:37,000
[RAMPO]
Hmm?

283
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:38,958
Hey! Ed, you came!

284
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:40,833
Glad you could make it.

285
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:44,500
Is it really all right for me
to be here like this, Rampo?

286
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:46,500
I am from a rival group.

287
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:48,458
Gimme a moment.
I'll be right back.

288
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:49,416
Huh?

289
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,250
Ah! Wait don't leave me alone!!

290
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:52,916
[GROUP chattering]

291
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,250
[YUKICHI] That was
impressive work out there.

292
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:57,125
The Agency would be
nothing without you.

293
00:17:57,208 --> 00:17:59,250
[AKIKO]
It's a party, drink with me!

294
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:02,125
[DOPPO]
Well, I guess one couldn't hurt.

295
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:05,958
Well Karl, seems like everyone's
having fun, aren't they?

296
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:17,583
[CHUUYA]
It's a Romanee-Conti.

297
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:19,708
[KOUYOU]
So generous!

298
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:21,416
Isn't this your treasure?

299
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,083
If there's a better occasion
to open this baby up,

300
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:25,833
then I don't know what it is.

301
00:18:25,916 --> 00:18:28,875
Let's make a toast.

302
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:30,958
To victory.

303
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:37,416
[OUGAI]
Hmm. Delicious.

304
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,458
[CHUUYA] Boss... how should
we punish Akutagawa?

305
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:42,416
[OUGAI]
Punish him?

306
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:45,583
He was a crucial element
in our success.

307
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:48,916
Akutagawa has always been
a bit of a loose cannon.

308
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
As many times as
he's gone rogue,

309
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:55,208
causing mayhem in the process,
he's always gotten results.

310
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:57,000
As long as he
continues to succeed,

311
00:18:57,083 --> 00:18:59,666
there will be no repercussions.

312
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,875
I wanted to ask you, Kouyou,

313
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:04,208
when you were
captured by the Agency,

314
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:06,500
why didn't you try and escape?

315
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:10,000
It ought to have been
quite easy for you to pull off.

316
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:13,125
Now why didn't I...?

317
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:16,416
Perhaps the tea
was just to die for.

318
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:20,250
[OSAMU] Hey, Sister, let's make
a deal, just us two grown-ups.

319
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:22,458
I have a plan for saving Kyouka.

320
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:24,166
I'm listening.

321
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:28,916
If we succeed, we'll be able to
save not only Kyouka's life,

322
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,458
but her happiness as well.

323
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:35,958
Dazai had already seen how
all of this would play out

324
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:37,458
to the very end.

325
00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:39,916
What a terrifying man.

326
00:19:40,958 --> 00:19:45,166
Listen, Kouyou,
your powers are undeniable.

327
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:49,125
If you wanted to leave the
Port Mafia and go after Kyouka,

328
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:54,291
it would be quite difficult for
me to stop you from doing so.

329
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:56,041
I know that.

330
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:58,458
Sadly, I have to help
a clumsy leader

331
00:19:58,541 --> 00:20:01,750
with reestablishing
their organization.

332
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:05,833
[OUGAI] Heh.
I'm quite grateful for that.

333
00:20:05,916 --> 00:20:09,083
But I prefer the women in
my life to be under 12.

334
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,083
Don't start.

335
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:11,958
Or I'll sew your mouth shut.

336
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:13,708
Damn you, Dazai!

337
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:16,000
I'll kill you next
time for sure!

338
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:17,916
[chirps]

339
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,458
[KIRAKO]
He's so adorable!

340
00:20:19,541 --> 00:20:21,250
Is it all right if I touch him?

341
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:23,625
[AKIKO]
Well, I guess he is pretty cute.

342
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:27,750
[JUNICHIROU] Hold on.
I got it. I got it. Here we go.

343
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:31,583
Oh, that's right, where's Dazai?

344
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:34,833
[footsteps]

345
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:41,791
[RYUUROU]
What a wierd piece.

346
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:44,416
I bet I could even paint
something like this.

347
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:51,708
[OSAMU] I wanted to thank
you for your help, Hirotsu.

348
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:53,541
[RYUUROU]
I did practically nothing.

349
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:55,541
I merely leaked
the infiltration route

350
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:58,333
of the Moby Dick to Higuchi.

351
00:20:58,416 --> 00:21:00,166
[OSAMU]
Yes, but once she knew,

352
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:02,625
it was a sure bet
she'd tell Akutagawa.

353
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:04,083
And once he knew,

354
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:07,750
it was obvious he'd go there
on his own to get Atsushi.

355
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:12,375
Why did you go through all
that trouble to bring Akutagawa

356
00:21:12,458 --> 00:21:14,958
and the Tiger Boy together?

357
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:17,875
You could call it "insurance."

358
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:19,833
We need to be ready.

359
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:23,708
A real disaster
is coming our way.

360
00:21:23,791 --> 00:21:25,833
And he's already on the move.

361
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:31,833
[DOSTOYEVSKY] So the destruction
of the Moby Dick was a failure.

362
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:36,041
Still, just about everything
else is going according to plan.

363
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:38,666
We succeeded in creating
a rift within the Guild,

364
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:41,791
and recruited talented
gifteds such as yourself.

365
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:44,333
I'm only helping for
the time being to fulfill

366
00:21:44,416 --> 00:21:50,000
my end of the deal, and to see
that Margaret is resuscitated.

367
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:52,625
[DOSTOYEVSKY]
That's fine by me, Pastor.

368
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:56,041
We'll work together.

369
00:21:56,125 --> 00:22:00,166
And paint this land
with the blood of the guilty.

370
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:03,083
All for the sake
of a better world.

371
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:07,833
[OSAMU] From past experiences,
I know that we won't be able

372
00:22:07,916 --> 00:22:11,750
to avoid going to
war with the Demon.

373
00:22:11,833 --> 00:22:15,500
Akutagawa is formidable enough
by himself, but his abilities

374
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:18,541
are most effective when
used in a supporting role.

375
00:22:18,625 --> 00:22:21,541
He would be a powerful ally
when complementing an attacker

376
00:22:21,625 --> 00:22:25,916
such as Atsushi, who excels
at speed and pure strength.

377
00:22:27,708 --> 00:22:30,083
[OSAMU] We'll need something
more ingenious than ever

378
00:22:30,166 --> 00:22:32,125
to fight against the Demon.

379
00:22:32,208 --> 00:22:33,500
Something even stronger

380
00:22:33,583 --> 00:22:37,583
than the former Double Black
team of me and Chuuya.

381
00:22:37,666 --> 00:22:40,041
They might pull it off.

382
00:22:40,958 --> 00:22:42,750
Tell me something...

383
00:22:42,833 --> 00:22:44,791
Why do you treasure Yokohama?

384
00:22:44,875 --> 00:22:48,916
You work so hard to defend the
people who live in this city.

385
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,416
[OSAMU] Heh. An old friend of
mine once told me something.

386
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:56,875
"Fight for the side of good
and protect the vulnerable.

387
00:22:56,958 --> 00:23:01,500
At least then, It'll make your
world a little more beautiful."

388
00:23:02,708 --> 00:23:05,875
[RYUUROU]
Teni Muhou.

389
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:15,208
[ATSUSHI]
This is the city we protected.

390
00:23:15,291 --> 00:23:18,541
[AKUTAGAWA coughs]

391
00:23:19,791 --> 00:23:23,375
[AKUTAGAWA]
What worthless nonsense.

392
00:23:39,583 --> 00:23:42,166
[ATSUSHI] This city
and all the people in it

393
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:44,791
have become my home.
