1
00:00:10,875 --> 00:00:13,875
[ODA]
I remember it was raining...

2
00:00:15,875 --> 00:00:19,125
[STRANGER] You're always
reading that same book, boy.

3
00:00:19,208 --> 00:00:20,125
[ODA]
Hm?

4
00:00:20,208 --> 00:00:22,500
[STRANGER]
Is it really that good?

5
00:00:22,583 --> 00:00:23,750
[ODA]
It is.

6
00:00:23,833 --> 00:00:25,708
I've read it several times now.

7
00:00:25,791 --> 00:00:28,791
[STRANGER] But there are so
many other stories out there,

8
00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:31,625
much more
interesting than that one.

9
00:00:31,708 --> 00:00:35,791
And where's part three?

10
00:00:35,875 --> 00:00:37,291
[ODA]
I don't have it.

11
00:00:37,375 --> 00:00:40,125
I've looked for it
everywhere, but no luck.

12
00:00:40,208 --> 00:00:42,750
[STRANGER]
Well, now it all makes sense.

13
00:00:42,833 --> 00:00:46,791
Because the third installment
is the worst of the worst.

14
00:00:46,875 --> 00:00:49,875
Best to be content
with those chapters.

15
00:00:49,958 --> 00:00:52,583
Just forget about the rest.

16
00:00:52,666 --> 00:00:54,625
[ODA]
I can't do that.

17
00:00:54,708 --> 00:00:56,916
[STRANGER]
Why don't you write it then?

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,750
[ODA]
Me, write it?

19
00:00:59,833 --> 00:01:02,625
[STRANGER] That's the only
way you can keep that story

20
00:01:02,708 --> 00:01:05,166
as perfect as
you've envisioned it.

21
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:06,708
Writing a story is akin

22
00:01:06,791 --> 00:01:10,166
to having complete
control over a person;

23
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:13,250
choosing how they
will live and die.

24
00:01:13,333 --> 00:01:18,000
From my vantage point, you
have all the right qualities.

25
00:01:18,083 --> 00:01:20,875
[ODA]
Just who are you anyway?

26
00:01:20,958 --> 00:01:23,041
[STRANGER]
Who am I?

27
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:26,000
My name is...

28
00:01:30,208 --> 00:01:33,708
Hmm? Huh...

29
00:01:33,791 --> 00:01:37,625
[OSAMU]
Good to see you awake, Odasaku.

30
00:01:37,708 --> 00:01:39,375
How do you feel?

31
00:01:39,458 --> 00:01:42,125
[ODA] Like every
bender I've ever had in my life

32
00:01:42,208 --> 00:01:45,583
just caught up
with me all at once.

33
00:01:45,666 --> 00:01:47,875
I went to the place
you told me about,

34
00:01:47,958 --> 00:01:49,375
and Ango was there.

35
00:01:49,458 --> 00:01:53,333
So it would seem my suspicions
were correct then.

36
00:01:53,416 --> 00:01:55,125
Yeah...

37
00:01:55,208 --> 00:01:56,291
He disappeared into the night

38
00:01:56,375 --> 00:02:00,750
with a group of
soldiers dressed in black.

39
00:02:00,833 --> 00:02:02,041
[OSAMU]
If I had to guess,

40
00:02:02,125 --> 00:02:05,791
I'd say they were
a Special Ops squad.

41
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:07,791
It looks like we can
divide these events

42
00:02:07,875 --> 00:02:10,333
into two separate categories.

43
00:02:10,416 --> 00:02:12,875
[ODA] Which one
do the soldiers fall under?

44
00:02:12,958 --> 00:02:15,291
[OSAMU] They're different from
Mimic, so we can take them

45
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:17,625
out of the equation
for the time being.

46
00:02:17,708 --> 00:02:21,458
Mimic is a far more
prevalent threat.

47
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:23,750
They've been causing
trouble in the city.

48
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:26,375
So we've assigned Akutagawa
and other members

49
00:02:26,458 --> 00:02:28,833
of our combat division
to deal with them.

50
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:30,416
But we still don't know anything

51
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,416
about what kind of ability
their leader possesses.

52
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,500
We're at a loss.

53
00:02:34,583 --> 00:02:37,083
This Akutagawa guy
you mentioned...

54
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:39,500
He's one of your
subordinates, right?

55
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:43,083
I understand he has
high offensive capabilities.

56
00:02:43,166 --> 00:02:45,958
He's a naked sword
without a scabbard.

57
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:47,541
In time, I have no doubt he'll

58
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:50,041
become the strongest
member in the Mafia,

59
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:54,458
but right now, he needs to be
taught how to sheathe his blade.

60
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:56,541
But I digress.

61
00:02:56,625 --> 00:03:00,166
This morning, the council of
five top executives convened,

62
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,750
and decided to attack Mimic

63
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:04,666
with everything the
Port Mafia can muster.

64
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:07,208
At the same time,
Akutagawa and some of my team

65
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:09,791
were hit by a surprise
attack at the art museum.

66
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:12,166
They're probably still fighting.

67
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:13,916
What are you doing?

68
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,791
Are you going?

69
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:18,666
Didn't you just say we're
hitting them with all we've got?

70
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:21,083
I didn't think you'd be
excited about fighting,

71
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:23,625
considering your stand
against killing anybody.

72
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:25,250
[ODA]
I'm not excited.

73
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:26,708
Why're you going then?

74
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:31,750
[ODA] I've acquired
a lot of debts in my life.

75
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:35,583
If your guys are in trouble,
then I should help.

76
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,416
You should forget
those debts, Odasaku...

77
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,791
After all, no one else but you

78
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:48,166
remembers what you owed
them in the first place.

79
00:04:06,416 --> 00:04:08,458
[AKUTAGAWA]
Guns are the weapons of fools.

80
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:18,166
Not even worth my time.

81
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:20,416
[GIDE] So you're the
one they speak of,

82
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,375
the gifted one in black.

83
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:24,375
[AKUTAGAWA]
Who are you?

84
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:29,750
You may call me Gide.

85
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:32,000
I am the leader of Mimic.

86
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:33,500
[AKUTAGAWA]
He will never acknowledge me,

87
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:36,291
no matter how many
underlings I defeat,

88
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:39,250
so I'd like to challenge you.

89
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:41,000
[GIDE]
First, a question...

90
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:42,958
The ability you possess.

91
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:45,375
Is it sufficient enough
to release our souls

92
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:47,125
from the prison of original sin?

93
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:49,125
Why don't you find out?!

94
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:53,333
Nice try!

95
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:58,791
It seems that you
are not the one...

96
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:05,041
No way!

97
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:07,125
Is this one of his abilities?

98
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:08,250
You bastard!

99
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:11,166
Are you able to read
what I'll do next?

100
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:14,541
[gunshot]

101
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,750
[GIDE]
With enough time,

102
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:32,666
you may become powerful
enough to grant our wish,

103
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:37,208
but unfortunately for us,
we have no time to give.

104
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:38,750
[AKUTAGAWA]
Kill me.

105
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:41,083
Defeat means the same as death.

106
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:46,125
I only regret that I was not
able to be the enemy you wanted.

107
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:47,750
Farewell.

108
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:49,250
[gasps]

109
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:01,833
Are you able to walk?

110
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:03,208
Hey!

111
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:05,416
What do you think you're doing?!

112
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,208
Put me down!

113
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:08,041
Let me go!

114
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,625
[ODA]
Name's Sakunosuke Oda.

115
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:13,291
I heard about you from
Dazai and came to help.

116
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:27,458
[AKUTAGAWA] I've heard of
you from Dazai as well.

117
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:30,916
You're one of our lower-ranking
members, aren't you?

118
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,458
[ODA]
That's right.

119
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:36,041
[AKUTAGAWA] And I heard
that you and he are friends.

120
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:38,000
Is that true?

121
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:39,583
That's not for me to say.

122
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:43,000
And I never use
that word lightly.

123
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:44,833
[AKUTAGAWA]
Dazai told me...

124
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:48,750
He told me I could never hope to
defeat you in a million years.

125
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:51,375
[ODA] This isn't
the time for an argument.

126
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:53,375
Tell me...

127
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:56,708
...why doesn't Dazai
acknowledge me?!

128
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:00,416
No way!

129
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:02,375
[ODA]
Sorry...

130
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:05,250
...but I have to bring you back.

131
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:08,375
A friend of mine has
high hopes for you.

132
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:13,958
[GIDE]
It did come true.

133
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:15,916
What are you talking about?

134
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,166
[GIDE]
I had a vision

135
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:20,625
that I'd be able to find
the person I seek here.

136
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:22,333
I am Gide.

137
00:07:22,416 --> 00:07:23,833
I have been
searching for the one

138
00:07:23,916 --> 00:07:26,750
who can release the
souls of ghosts like us.

139
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:28,458
[ODA]
Well, I can get you a discount

140
00:07:28,541 --> 00:07:31,583
with a local undertaker
if you'd like.

141
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:33,416
No need for that.

142
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,958
You're just the
person for the job.

143
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:44,041
[gasps]

144
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,250
Can't be...

145
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:51,666
[GIDE]
What's the matter?

146
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:54,791
I haven't even made a
move yet, and you're sweating.

147
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:56,083
[ODA]
What did you do?!

148
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:57,583
[GIDE]
I simply saw a future

149
00:07:57,666 --> 00:07:59,833
where you would
dodge to the right,

150
00:07:59,916 --> 00:08:02,666
so I proceeded to adjust my aim.

151
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:06,208
But it would seem that
you saw that future as well,

152
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:11,125
and compensated accordingly,
which I also witnessed.

153
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:14,458
Your ability to see a few
seconds into the future...

154
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:18,625
I know it well
because I have it too.

155
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:21,583
The predictive ability
we have is omnipotent,

156
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:23,708
which is why you
are the only one

157
00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:26,916
who can kill me
and end this war.

158
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
As a member of the
Port Mafia, killing me,

159
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:34,041
the enemy leader,
must be your greatest desire.

160
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:35,375
[ODA]
Not interested.

161
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:38,166
I'm only here to help
one of my colleagues out.

162
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:39,541
What?

163
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:41,958
What kind of
Mafia member are you?

164
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:44,166
One that doesn't kill people.

165
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,875
[GIDE] Guns are tools
for killing people!

166
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:49,250
You put yourself in a war zone!

167
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:51,333
[ODA]
I'm not interested in violence.

168
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:52,750
What...?!

169
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:56,500
The only thing I'm interested
in is living my life.

170
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:59,750
Life is nothing compared
to the glory of death!

171
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:17,791
Excellent!

172
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:19,916
That's the way!

173
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,416
What?!

174
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:27,125
Is this your way of telling me
that you refuse to fight me?

175
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:29,916
[ODA] I have my
reasons for not killing people.

176
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,458
You'll have to look elsewhere.

177
00:09:31,541 --> 00:09:34,125
Why is that?

178
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:36,916
My subordinates and I have
been wandering this world

179
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,166
like tormented spirits,
looking for a worthy end.

180
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:44,291
You are the one
who can deliver that to us.

181
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:46,916
You must fight me!
If you don't, then--

182
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,083
[ODA] I can't help
you with your dream

183
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:52,750
because I have a dream
of my own to fulfill.

184
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:55,416
Some day, when I can
quit the Port Mafia

185
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,625
and become a free man,

186
00:09:57,708 --> 00:10:03,166
I'll find a quiet room,
one overlooking the sea...

187
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:06,083
[STRANGER] Then why
don't you write it then?

188
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:08,833
That's the only way
you can keep that story

189
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:12,083
as perfect as
you've envisioned it.

190
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:14,875
Then I'll be able
to become a writer.

191
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:19,833
Take up a pen, and throw
away my sword for good.

192
00:10:19,916 --> 00:10:22,875
Someone once told me
writing a story is akin

193
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:26,875
to having control
over a person's life.

194
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:28,708
A man who takes
a life has no right

195
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:31,291
to be responsible for another's.

196
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:33,041
That's why I don't do it.

197
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:34,291
And that's the reason

198
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:37,250
why you refuse to
deliver respite upon us?

199
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:40,875
Is this really your answer?!

200
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:42,666
That's right.

201
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:47,958
[gasps]

202
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,500
Stop this!

203
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:03,416
[GIDE]
A bullet-proof vest, huh?

204
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:06,291
That pain is a
privilege of the living.

205
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:09,375
It's something we lost long ago.

206
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:11,583
We are already dead.

207
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:14,375
Our souls have
long left our bodies,

208
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:17,458
to be replaced
by vengeful spirits.

209
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:20,458
It doesn't have to be this way!

210
00:11:20,541 --> 00:11:22,750
I don't know what
happened to you in the past,

211
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:25,958
but you still have a choice over
how you live in the present!

212
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:27,166
[GIDE]
Don't you see?

213
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,958
Only you can end our suffering!

214
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:38,291
If you truly understood, you
would grant my wish and kill me,

215
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:40,333
yet you refuse.

216
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:41,708
And because you are the only one

217
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:45,541
who can guide us to the
battlefield of purification,

218
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:48,125
I cannot kill you either.

219
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:52,416
I must make it apparent
to you who we really are.

220
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,750
Then you will understand,
between the two of us,

221
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:59,750
only one can be allowed
to remain here.

222
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:02,875
I hope you'll
look forward to it.

223
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:34,708
[OSAMU]
The night is the best time,

224
00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:37,333
and it belongs
to the Port Mafia.

225
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:38,791
[ODA]
So what do we do now?

226
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:41,083
[OSAMU]
Can't say I know.

227
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:43,500
That was quite a
fiasco you got into.

228
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:45,500
Who would've thought
the enemy leader

229
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:48,458
would turn out to be
such huge fan of yours?

230
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:50,208
[ODA]
They're a strange bunch,

231
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:51,666
looking for a place to die

232
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:54,000
that they feel is
"worthy" or something.

233
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,208
[OSAMU]
I see...

234
00:13:55,291 --> 00:13:56,916
Having some kind of
creative control over

235
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,916
how they die is something
I hadn't considered.

236
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,791
How long do you
think this conflict will last?

237
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:05,166
[OSAMU]
Mimic's army aside,

238
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:07,458
their leader's ability
is a nuisance.

239
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:09,625
Surprise attacks won't work.

240
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:13,458
That means we need
some kind of inside info.

241
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:16,916
Any leads you can think of?

242
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,708
Ango's the only one.

243
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:21,125
That's just who
I was thinking of.

244
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:24,541
I don't suppose that there's
anyway we could find him...

245
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:25,875
There is.

246
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:28,583
You serious?

247
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:33,125
As a matter of fact, we don't
even have to look much further.

248
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:35,791
[ODA]
He's really here?

249
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,916
[OSAMU chuckles]
Of course, where else?

250
00:14:46,166 --> 00:14:49,833
Hey, you guys,
I started without you.

251
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:56,375
[ODA] You know,
you could've given us a call.

252
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:58,041
[ANGO] I had to spend
a little more time

253
00:14:58,125 --> 00:15:00,166
covering my tracks than usual.

254
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:03,875
Though today, I can spend
as much time here as I want.

255
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:07,583
So then... how did
you two know I'd be here?

256
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:11,500
[OSAMU]
Just a hunch, I suppose.

257
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:13,750
[ANGO]
I feel lucky.

258
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:17,250
I didn't think I'd ever be able
to come back here again.

259
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,375
You know, I've gotta say Ango,

260
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:22,583
you're awfully
sentimental for a mole.

261
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:25,125
Even before you
joined the Port Mafia,

262
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:27,333
you had a different identity.

263
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:29,291
You were an agent of the state.

264
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:33,666
Specifically, of the Ministry's
Gifted Operations Division.

265
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:36,958
Your mission was to
monitor the Port Mafia.

266
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:39,708
While the Division
oversees all gifted activity

267
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:42,375
within our nation, an all-out
war with the Port Mafia

268
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:45,041
would incur heavy casualties.

269
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:49,083
Therefore, their primary purpose
is to supervise our activity,

270
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:51,583
as opposed to engaging
us in a skirmish.

271
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:54,125
That's why they had an
agent infiltrate our ranks

272
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:56,625
in order to keep tabs on us.

273
00:15:56,708 --> 00:16:01,833
But all that changed when Mimic
pulled up a seat at the table.

274
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:03,875
This gifted
criminal organization

275
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:06,041
had been planning
to enter Japan

276
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:09,000
and were proving to be a real
headache for the Division,

277
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:12,125
so they decided to
have you monitor Mimic

278
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:14,583
as the Port Mafia's spy.

279
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,500
As a lowly salaried
government worker,

280
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:22,000
it was a job entirely
above my pay grade.

281
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:23,583
[ODA]
So, in other words,

282
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:27,333
you weren't a double agent,
but actually a triple agent.

283
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:29,333
Do I have that right?

284
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:36,708
[OSAMU]
Tell us about Mimic.

285
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:40,791
[ANGO] I understand that you
and Gide traded blows, Odasaku.

286
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:44,333
Did you happen to get
a glimpse of his ability?

287
00:16:44,416 --> 00:16:45,416
[ODA]
I did.

288
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,833
[ANGO] He's an elusive man

289
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:49,750
and we never know
exactly where he is.

290
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:53,500
The brass intends to leave
this case to the Port Mafia.

291
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:56,125
[OSAMU] Well, that's very
convenient for them,

292
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:59,750
but even the Port Mafia is going
to have a difficult time dealing

293
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:03,083
with a special
ability like that.

294
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:05,166
Of course,
that's only in the case

295
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:08,750
that we don't consider
using a... certain someone.

296
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:11,500
Both of us can only
see into the near future,

297
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:15,250
so I wouldn't have any
meaningful advantage over him.

298
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:16,791
If push came to shove,

299
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:18,541
the outcome would
most likely come down

300
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:20,416
to our skills in combat.

301
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:23,416
The unknown variables
would matter a lot.

302
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,375
There's also the
ability's singularity.

303
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:28,708
What "singularity"
are you talking about?

304
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:31,291
When you used your ability
in the fight against Gide,

305
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:35,750
didn't something rather
unusual happen to you?

306
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:48,291
Yeah, it did...

307
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:51,083
Through observation, the
government has determined

308
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:54,125
that certain abilities when
interacting with one another

309
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:57,666
will become imbued with
entirely new characteristics,

310
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:01,416
although these cases
have proven to be quite rare.

311
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,000
You know, I'm really not
supposed to be here,

312
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,416
telling you two any of this.

313
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,708
If they knew what
I was doing right now,

314
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:12,208
it would cause a lot of problems
between me and the brass.

315
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:14,750
I'll have to go underground
for the time being.

316
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:16,250
That's cute.

317
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:19,208
You think we're gonna let
you walk out of here alive,

318
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:20,791
just like that?

319
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:24,500
You really gonna
start a fight here?

320
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:27,083
[ANGO]
This was a mistake.

321
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:29,500
I was naïve to come here.

322
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:32,458
I thought that maybe
if we met up like this again,

323
00:18:32,541 --> 00:18:36,208
things would go back to normal,
back to how they were.

324
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:38,208
Ango.

325
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:41,750
You need to get out of here
before I change my mind...

326
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:45,375
[OSAMU]
It's all right. I'm not sad...

327
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,875
I knew this would happen
from the beginning...

328
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:50,541
It wouldn't have mattered
what side you were on.

329
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:54,375
Because anything I never
want to lose, is always lost.

330
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:57,041
This is how it's
always been for me.

331
00:18:57,125 --> 00:19:01,458
Everything worth wanting
is lost the moment I obtain it.

332
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,625
And nothing I pursue is worth

333
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:05,916
the cost of
prolonging this life.

334
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,875
This suffering.

335
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:17,458
[ANGO] Listen, you two,
if there... if there

336
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:21,791
ever comes a time when
our sides don't exist anymore,

337
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:24,416
when we all become free men,

338
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,250
I want us to all
come back here and--

339
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:28,291
Ango, just stop.

340
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:33,541
[ODA]
Don't say anything more.

341
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:34,791
[ODA]
No...!

342
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:37,416
[ODA]
Hey!

343
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:43,958
Kosuke! Katsumi! Yu!

344
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:45,125
Shinju!

345
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:47,541
Sakura!

346
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:52,291
A map?

My throat felt raw...

350
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:22,375
I couldn't breathe...

351
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:26,125
Somewhere in the distance,
I heard someone screaming.

352
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:29,666
Eventually, I realized
the reason my throat hurt

353
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:33,708
was because I was the
one who was screaming...

354
00:21:35,625 --> 00:21:38,666
[STRANGER]
Why don't you write it then?

355
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:41,291
That's the only way
you can keep that story

356
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:45,208
as perfect as
you've envisioned it.

357
00:21:45,291 --> 00:21:46,166
[ODA]
I can't...

358
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:47,625
[STRANGER]
Hm?

359
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:52,250
Not anymore...

360
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:57,083
I can't write a story anymore.

361
00:21:57,166 --> 00:22:07,166

[ODA]
Alas, that is not the truth.

364
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,791
He is simply a child who happens
to be exceptionally clever.

365
00:23:55,875 --> 00:23:59,041
A child, crying
in the dark, alone,

366
00:23:59,125 --> 00:24:02,166
left to fend for himself
with a hole in his heart

367
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:06,083
as large as the world itself.

368
00:24:06,166 --> 00:24:10,208
Now I regret not having stepped
in to ease his loneliness.
