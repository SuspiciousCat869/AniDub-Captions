1
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:11,916
[FITZGERALD]
All right then, Tiger Boy,

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,333
time to come with me.

3
00:00:14,416 --> 00:00:17,208
[ATSUSHI] It's the same
thing all over again.

4
00:00:17,291 --> 00:00:21,000
I'm right back
to where I started.

5
00:00:21,083 --> 00:00:22,041
[KYOUKA]
Hold it.

6
00:00:22,125 --> 00:00:22,916
[FITZGERALD]
Hmm?

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
[ATSUSHI]
Huh?

8
00:00:25,083 --> 00:00:27,541
You're with the
Port Mafia, aren't you?

9
00:00:27,625 --> 00:00:28,791
Not quite.

10
00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:30,708
I'm with the Agency now.

11
00:00:30,791 --> 00:00:32,583
Name's Kyouka.

12
00:00:34,041 --> 00:00:36,083
[FITZGERALD]
What a barbaric display!

13
00:00:36,166 --> 00:00:38,625
And from such
a young girl at that.

14
00:00:38,708 --> 00:00:41,291
Huh? No, wait!

15
00:00:44,166 --> 00:00:46,166
Good grief.

16
00:00:48,625 --> 00:00:50,916
[ATSUSHI] We've been
looking all over for you.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,666
Where have you been?

18
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:54,916
[KYOUKA]
In the slums and back alleys,

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,166
where I used to live.

20
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:01,625
But I realized that I didn't
belong there anymore.

21
00:01:01,708 --> 00:01:05,125
I made a call to the police
from a pay phone.

22
00:01:06,208 --> 00:01:08,416
The Guild will have a
difficult time moving around

23
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,833
with them on the scene.

24
00:01:10,916 --> 00:01:11,833
[ATSUSHI]
Kyouka...

25
00:01:11,916 --> 00:01:13,083
[KYOUKA]
Hm?

26
00:01:13,166 --> 00:01:15,166
You didn't have to get
involved in this war.

27
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:18,166
All you had to do
was stay hidden away.

28
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:22,791
But my only real home
is at the Agency.

29
00:01:22,875 --> 00:01:26,875
[KOUYOU] Kyouka is destined
to kill many more times.

30
00:01:26,958 --> 00:01:28,333
That gift is bound to her,

31
00:01:28,416 --> 00:01:30,625
and she will never
escape the darkness.

32
00:01:30,708 --> 00:01:33,458
Much the same way
that I never could.

33
00:01:35,208 --> 00:01:38,666
[KYOUKA] For the first time
ever, I wanna be more.

34
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:40,250
I'll fight for that.

35
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:44,083
And if that means using
what lurks inside me, so be it.

36
00:01:47,583 --> 00:01:49,041
[KYOUKA]
They're here.

37
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:22,416
[ATSUSHI]
Excuse me, sir.

38
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,958
[OFFICER A]
What happened here?

39
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:25,333
[ATSUSHI]
Somebody attacked us.

40
00:03:25,416 --> 00:03:26,250
They were armed.

41
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:27,458
That's horrible...

42
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:28,791
Captain!

43
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:32,750
Unit six here,
calling for headquarters.

44
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:34,125
[OFFICER C]
This is headquarters.

45
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:36,125
What's your location?

46
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:38,041
We're currently at dock three.

47
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:38,916
[OFFICER C]
We've received reports

48
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,208
of a serial killer in that area.

49
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:45,875
Subject is a young girl dressed
in traditional Japanese clothes.

50
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:48,791
She is approximately
14 years of age.

51
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:51,875
Take any necessary precautions.

52
00:03:51,958 --> 00:03:56,375
Tell me young lady,
how old are you?

53
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,375
Headquarters, we have a--

54
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:02,750
Captain!

55
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:08,708
How could you do that?!

56
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:09,416
[OFFICER A]
Captain!

57
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,625
Just hang in there!

58
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:13,125
Headquarters,
requesting backup!

59
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:18,166
Just flawless.

60
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:20,625
[FITZGERALD] Even the
target's escape measures

61
00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:22,583
were accounted for.

62
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:26,583
Miss Louisa's strategy proposals
are perfect, as always.

63
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:29,208
[KYOUKA gasps]

64
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:32,291
[KYOUKA gasps]

[TWAIN whistles]

66
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:36,000
Right on the money.

67
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:38,458
I used a rubber bullet so
we don't seriously hurt her,

68
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:41,000
but it's will string like hell.

69
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:43,625
[FITZGERALD]
Nicely done, Mark.

70
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:47,625
[FITZGERALD]
Well then, my little princess...

71
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:50,250
I'll be taking your
prince charming.

72
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:51,041
You can't!

73
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:52,625
Give him back!

74
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:54,375
[FITZGERALD]
I'm ready, Mr. Melville.

75
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:56,458
[MELVILLE]
Understood.

76
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,875
It's been a while,
my old friend.

77
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:15,416
[FITZGERALD]
I know we've only just met,

78
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:19,791
but allow me to give you some
advice, my little princess.

79
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:23,458
Your talents aren't
suited for helping people.

80
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:25,583
I don't believe I need
to spell out for you

81
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:28,625
what they are suited for.

82
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:37,208
[KYOUKA]
Why...

83
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:41,583
Why did you have
to show me the light?

84
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:44,875
Why did you have
to go and give me hope?

85
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:50,791
[GUARD]
Hands up!

86
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:53,666
You're under arrest
on suspicion of murder.

87
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:57,416
[KYOUKA]
Goodbye.

88
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,000
Don't show me any more light.

89
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:02,041
I can't take it.

90
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:10,416
[Q]
Ahh, it's so beautiful out.

91
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,291
I wonder who we
should play with today?

00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,583
How about him?

00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:19,916
Hey, Mister, do you wanna
have some fun with me?

95
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,791
You're from the Guild,
aren't you?

96
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:24,625
I'm sorry. "Have fun"?

97
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:27,041
Like a child?

98
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:33,750
[LOVECRFT]
Oh.

00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:35,291
Here you are.

00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:38,041
Uh. No thanks...

Okay, it's my turn
to pick a game!

There!

105
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:48,583
Because you "hurt" me,
now you get a special mark!

106
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:52,625
Now, show me, Mister...

107
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:55,750
Show me true madness!

108
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:59,875
[LOVECRAFT] I'm sorry,
but I'm not sure I understand.

109
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:03,458
Would this be true madness?

110
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:06,083
[Q screams]

111
00:07:12,583 --> 00:07:14,875

Good to see you awake, pastor.

[HAWTHORNE]
Lord Francis...

113
00:07:19,583 --> 00:07:21,541
How are you feeling?

114
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:24,208
[HAWTHORNE]
Where's Margaret?

115
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:28,333
[FITZGERALD]
In critical condition.

116
00:07:28,416 --> 00:07:30,458
She may never wake up.

117
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:32,375
[HAWTHORNE chuckles]

118
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:33,666
[FITZGERALD]
Hmm?

119
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:37,416
What an impudent woman.

120
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,291
She protected me
in that last moment.

121
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:43,791
That's why I'm still alive.

122
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:45,208
Before that happened,

123
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:48,291
Margaret said she would
take back her family's honor.

124
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:50,333
What did she mean by that?

125
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:51,583
She joined this operation

126
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:54,125
in order to repay
her family's debts,

127
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:57,875
and by doing so,
revitalize their reputation.

128
00:07:57,958 --> 00:08:01,541
But that's nothing more
than a fleeting dream.

129
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:03,583
[HAWTHORNE]
It was never fleeting.

130
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:07,000
Not until you made
it so, Lord Francis.

131
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:08,333
What was that?

132
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:10,833
[HAWTHORNE] I will not
depend on you any longer.

133
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:13,708
If you chose to do nothing,

134
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:16,875
I will take back
her honor myself.

Huh? But that plan

will incur a terrible amount
of collateral damage!

00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:39,958
[LUCY]
Pardon me.

164
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,125
[LUCY]
Hmph!

165
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:46,583
Why's she here?

166
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:49,916
[FITZGERALD] That's right,
you and Miss Lucy have met.

167
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,833
She's of no strategic
value to us now that her ability

168
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:57,666
is out of the bag, but she
insisted on staying with us.

169
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:00,541
Now then, back to business.

170
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:03,500
We are looking
for a particular book.

171
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:05,000
[ATSUSHI]
A book?

172
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:06,625
[FITZGERALD]
There's only a single copy of it

173
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:08,583
in the entire world.

174
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:11,500
It's said to be impervious
to any amount of firepower

175
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,750
or type of special abilities.

176
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:15,958
Someone with a gift foresaw
that it would be found

177
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:18,416
sealed away here in Yokohama.

178
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,125
[ATSUSHI] What does any
of that have to do with me?!

179
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:23,916
[FITZGERALD] You are very
much like the Tiger Beetle;

180
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,875
a term that can also
mean guide post.

181
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:29,500
I brought you here because
I wouldn't want you turning

182
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:32,541
to ashes along with
the rest of the city.

183
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:34,125
Ashes?!

184
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:37,541
[FITZGERALD] We've neutralized
the Gifted Operations Division.

185
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:40,375
But the Armed Detective Agency
and the Port Mafia

186
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:43,000
have both proven
to be quite a pain.

187
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:45,250
If we simply burn the city down,

188
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:48,500
we eliminate them and
make our search easier.

189
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:51,083
There's no way anyone
has such a powerful gift!

190
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:53,333
Does this look at
all familiar to you?

191
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:55,791
[gasps]

192
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:58,666
[STEINBECK] This plan makes
use of both of our abilities,

193
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,666
essentially combining
them together

194
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:03,000
to create the desired effect.

195
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:05,708
My ability gives me
the power to share my senses

196
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:08,583
between a host and vegetation.

197
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:12,083
I've connected you
to every tree in Yokohama.

198
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:14,416
The civilians will
proceed with their day,

199
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:17,666
blithely walking on roots,
hitting the trunks,

200
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,875
and cutting down branches.

201
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:22,958
All of that pain is being
transmitted into you,

202
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:25,125
even as we speak.

203
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:27,875
Now then, time for a pop quiz.

204
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:29,041
What do you think would happen

205
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:32,541
if your ability were
to be activated now?

206
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:34,791
[FITZGERALD] The moment
I rip this doll's head off,

207
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:40,458
roughly 20 percent of this city
will be afflicted by the curse.

208
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:42,708
This is our emergency plan.

209
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:46,250
We call it the Yokohama
Incineration Operation.

210
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:52,041
[STEINBECK] This city will
be destroyed all because of you.

211
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:53,666
Why me?

212
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:56,416
It's not like I had ever
asked to have this ability

213
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,166
in the first place.

214
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,833
So why do all of these terrible
things have to happen

215
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:02,416
because of me?

216
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,708
Isn't everyone equal
in the eyes of God?

217
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:07,541
You'd think so.

218
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:10,500
But this world
isn't nearly that kind.

219
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:13,583
So allow me to
tell you the bitter truth:

220
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:15,708
God does exist.

221
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:18,958
But... he has no love for you.

222
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:20,500
Liar!

223
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:21,750
No, it can't be.

224
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:22,916
I won't allow it!

225
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,625
I'll burn this world down!

226
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:25,541
I'll curse it!

227
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:28,583
I'll curse it all!

228
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:34,666
[laughs]

229
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,041
[WOMAN]
Hey, sweetie...

230
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:37,416
[MAN]
Yeah? What's up?

231
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,250
[WOMAN]
Did you always have that scar?

232
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:45,291
[laughs]

233
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:46,583
So it begins...

234
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:48,583
Now, to activate the ability,

235
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:51,833
all that's left for me
to do is destroy this doll.

236
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:52,541
[ATSUSHI]
Wait!

237
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:53,750
[SOLDIER]
Hey!

238
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:54,916
I give up!

239
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,333
The Agency and
I will help you accomplish

240
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:58,125
whatever it is you're after!

241
00:12:58,208 --> 00:13:01,375
I'm begging you though,
please don't destroy that doll!

242
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:03,333
Is that your proposal?

243
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:05,500
How very interesting.

244
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:06,375
Fine.

245
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:08,708
Let's form a cooperative then.

246
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:14,500
[FITZGERALD] But only...
with the lucky survivors.

247
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:21,708
[MINOURA]
Ugh... a traffic jam.

248
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,541
It's kinda relaxing.

249
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:25,541
Not the word I'd use.

250
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:27,875
What the hell's going on?!

251
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:29,166
[POLICE OFFICER]
Sir, look!

252
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:30,750
[MINOURA]
Huh?

253
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,000
[ATSUSHI]
Let me out!

254
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:36,500
Damn it!

255
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:40,041
[ATSUSHI]
I've gotta do something!

256
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:41,458
[LUCY]
Oh my,

257
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:43,791
I thought I'd check on you
on my way to the garbage.

258
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:45,375
What a pleasant sight.

259
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:46,666
[ATSUSHI]
It's you...

260
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,791
Please, let me out of here!

261
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:50,750
[LUCY]
Not a chance!

262
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:52,750
I hate privileged
people like you!

263
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:55,375
Always looking down
on the rest of us.

264
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:58,083
Maybe you'll know how
it feels to be someone like me

265
00:13:58,166 --> 00:13:59,916
when this place burns down,

266
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,041
and you're thrown
away like this doll.

267
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:06,625
Believe it or not,
I know exactly how you feel.

268
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:07,500
It must be--

269
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:09,791
How would you know anything?!

270
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:13,500
Have you ever been made to wash
dishes until your fingers bled?

271
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:16,916
Have you ever been tortured
with a hot iron poker?

272
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,750
You have absolutely no idea
how much pain and agony

273
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:21,833
I went through
to get these scars!

274
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:26,750
The first day,
it's the bones that hurt.

275
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:29,041
But the third day is the worst.

276
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,416
Oh!

277
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:36,083
[ATSUSHI]  Your skin burns
every time you move.

278
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:39,416
The pain is excruciating.

279
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:43,625
I know that feeling of horrible
isolation all too well.

280
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:48,458
But loneliness isn't some tyrant
that can keep us down forever.

281
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:51,125
It's more like a rain cloud
that can vanish

282
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:54,041
as quickly as it's formed.

283
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:58,208
A lot of people down there
have the same wounds we do.

284
00:14:58,291 --> 00:15:00,625
If you abandon them...

285
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:07,041
[ATSUSHI] ...you abandon who
you were before all of this.

286
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:09,000
Is that what you want?

287
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:12,625
[gasps]

288
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:13,916
Where am I?

289
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,291
[LUCY]
You're too late.

290
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:17,125
Yokohama's done for.

291
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:19,916
[ATSUSHI]
No, there's still a way.

292
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,500
Dazai only needs to
be able to touch the doll

293
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:24,625
in order to stop the curse.

294
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:26,291
You must be delusional.

295
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:28,416
Did you forget
that we're in the sky?

296
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,166
Just how do you plan
to get the doll to him?

297
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:39,250
So... you're serious then.

298
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:42,291
You'll probably get shot
and killed in the air.

299
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:44,750
Maybe you'll hit
the ground and then die.

300
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:47,541
Or get cut up by
the mad men down there.

301
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:49,375
But you know all that already.

302
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:51,916
And you're still going to do it.

303
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,125
There was an old book
I read back at the orphanage.

304
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:58,916
One of the passages
stood out to me.

305
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,500
It read, "I've never regretted
any of the things I've done.

306
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:07,666
I've only regretted
the things that I didn't do.

307
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:12,000
Now that I think about it, what
was the name of that author?

308
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:19,291
[LUCY]
It's a parachute.

309
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:23,083
I kept one hidden in case
I needed to escape.

310
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:26,291
I connected the white door
to Moby Dick's exterior.

311
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:27,666
Hang on.

312
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:31,458
Won't the Guild punish you
for letting me get away?

313
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:34,750
Don't worry,
I've always been a lonely girl.

314
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:39,125
Besides, as long as I'm in
this room, they can't touch me.

315
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:50,208
Hey...

316
00:16:50,291 --> 00:16:52,666
Are you sure that you're
gonna be all right here?

317
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,166
[LUCY]
Hm?

318
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:57,041
I know you said you'd be safe
while you're in this room.

319
00:16:57,125 --> 00:16:59,250
But if that's true,

320
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:02,833
doesn't that also mean you
can never leave this place?

321
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:06,041
You're a bit slow on the uptake.

322
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:09,333
It was simply an excuse.

323
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:11,625
Live...

324
00:17:11,708 --> 00:17:13,625
And then,

325
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:17,458
you can rescue me
from this place someday.

326
00:17:17,541 --> 00:17:20,125
I'll be waiting.

327
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:22,083
It's a promise.

328
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:27,791
[FITZGERALD]
The tiger has escaped.

329
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:28,958
To your stations!

330
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:31,166
I repeat; The tiger has escaped!

331
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,916
Prepare the anti-air cannons!

332
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:39,458
Down there...

333
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,791
Keep the chaos under control!

334
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:49,125
If this keeps up, we won't have
anywhere left to do business.

335
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:51,916
Protect it with your life!

336
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,416
[ATSUSHI]
I see...

337
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,750
So that's what's going on.

338
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,458
[TWAIN]
All right, then.

339
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:02,000
If you have a moving target,

340
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:05,583
and you need to blow it out
of the sky, just leave it to me!

341
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:10,708
I can see you!

342
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:12,291
[ATSUSHI]
What the...!

343
00:18:14,916 --> 00:18:16,833
Tom has pinpointed the target.

344
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:18,500
Yeah, atta boy, Tom!

345
00:18:18,583 --> 00:18:21,041
All right now, Huck,
let's load the second shell.

346
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:22,250
[FINN]
Yes, sir.

347
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:23,833
Trajectory, check.

348
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:27,250
Accounting for firing
velocity with target, check.

349
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:32,666
It looks like Huck's shot

350
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,875
ripped right through
the kids parachute.

351
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:36,291
Yeah!!

352
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:38,666
So, how's our tiger boy doing?

353
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,208
He passed out from the blast.

354
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:42,916
At this rate, he'll be
dashed to pieces for sure.

355
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,625
But weren't you given
the order <i>not</i> to kill him?

356
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,500
Ah... As long as
his people find the body,

357
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:50,416
I'm sure they can figure
out a work-around.

358
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:58,083
[ATSUSHI]
I wasn't any help after all.

359
00:18:58,166 --> 00:19:00,208
I couldn't do anything.

360
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:03,416
[tiger growl]

361
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:06,958
[ATSUSHI]
It's you.

362
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:08,291
Of course...

363
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:11,416
[tiger growl]

364
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,541
[ATSUSHI]
You hate me, don't you?

365
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:23,083
[ATSUSHI]
I hate myself, too.

366
00:19:31,416 --> 00:19:34,291
[ATSUSHI]
Thank you... for everything.

367
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:56,041
[ATSUSHI]
I'm alive?

368
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:58,666
[DOLL laughs]

369
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:00,875
I have to deliver it!!

370
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:09,625
[gasps]

371
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:19,583
[ATSUSHI]
I need to stop all of this, now!

372
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:24,958
Amazing...

373
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:26,958
First he survived
such a huge fall,

374
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:29,250
and now my rain of bullets
can't even touch him.

375
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:32,750
He must be really desperate
to deliver that disgusting doll.

376
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:36,000
[TWAIN] Well! This is
no longer a hunt then.

377
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:38,750
This is a duel between two men.

378
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:40,291
[ATSUSHI]
What?

379
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:42,750
Has that thing always been here?

380
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:46,916
[TWAIN] Now's not the time
to lose focus, Tiger Boy.

381
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,083
There's no telling which way
trouble will come at you.

382
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:52,958
That's an oil truck!

383
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:06,541
This is over.

384
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:16,750
[ORPHANAGE MAN 1]
Stop your struggling.

385
00:21:16,833 --> 00:21:18,625
You've reached your limit.

386
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:22,833
[ATSUSHI]
Shut up.

387
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:42,416
[ATSUSHI]
Huh?!

388
00:21:44,416 --> 00:21:48,125
You did very well, Atsushi.

389
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:50,250
Dazai...

390
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:51,666
It's dangerous here.

391
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,541
They'll shoot at you from above!

392
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:55,625
I don't think they will.

393
00:22:01,791 --> 00:22:02,958
Smoke?

394
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:04,250
[FINN] I think there's
more to it than that!

395
00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:06,291
All heat sensors and
radars have been disabled.

396
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:08,166
It's a sensor jammer!

397
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:10,791
[TWAIN] He's been setting
those things up all over town.

398
00:22:10,875 --> 00:22:13,166
He knew the kid would
get there with the doll!

399
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:18,583
[laughs]

400
00:22:18,666 --> 00:22:20,625
Looks like ya got me!

401
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:23,625
[OSAMU]
Good job, Atsushi...

402
00:22:23,708 --> 00:22:26,291
Yokohama is saved.

403
00:22:26,375 --> 00:22:29,416
Though I can't say we're
out of the woods just yet.

404
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,500
As long as the enemy has Q,

405
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:36,041
they'll repeat this carnage
as many times as they need to.

406
00:22:36,125 --> 00:22:40,208
So, what should we do now?

407
00:22:40,291 --> 00:22:42,625
Dazai...

408
00:22:42,708 --> 00:22:45,791
There's a passage from a
book I read a long time ago.

409
00:22:49,208 --> 00:22:55,416
I remember it said the head
may err, but never the blood.

410
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:58,708
So I have an idea
about what to do.

411
00:22:58,791 --> 00:23:02,541
I know it might sound out of
the question to everyone else...

412
00:23:02,625 --> 00:23:07,125
But to me, right to my core,
in my blood and soul,

413
00:23:07,208 --> 00:23:09,750
I feel it's the
only right answer.

414
00:23:09,833 --> 00:23:11,791
[OSAMU]
What's your idea?

415
00:23:11,875 --> 00:23:14,166
[ATSUSHI]
An alliance.

416
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:17,250
They're the most powerful
group in Yokohama,

417
00:23:17,333 --> 00:23:20,666
and they're fighting
to defend this city.

418
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:24,041
I can't think of a
better organization

419
00:23:24,125 --> 00:23:26,875
to help us in our fight
against the Guild.

420
00:23:26,958 --> 00:23:29,541
And which organization is that?

421
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:38,500
[ATSUSHI]
The Port Mafia.

422
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:47,875
[ATSUSHI] "The head may,
err... but never the blood."

423
00:23:47,958 --> 00:23:51,250
[OUGAI] An alliance between
the Port Mafia and the Agency?

424
00:23:51,333 --> 00:23:52,500
[YUKICHI]
As a part of an organization

425
00:23:52,583 --> 00:23:54,833
that operates
to protect this city,

426
00:23:54,916 --> 00:23:58,125
I cannot allow foreign
gifteds to destroy it.

427
00:23:58,208 --> 00:23:59,333
[OUGAI]
Could the two organizations

428
00:23:59,416 --> 00:24:02,375
see past their grudges
to form an alliance?

429
00:24:02,458 --> 00:24:04,458
If we pulled off such a feat,

430
00:24:04,541 --> 00:24:08,500
the most powerful
duo will be revived.

431
00:24:08,583 --> 00:24:10,958
Next time on <i>Bungo Stray Dogs,</i>

433

with little girls, I see.
