[KENJI] So, who's in change
while the President is away?

161
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:39,500
The Military Police asked
me who our agency's

162
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,916
second-in-command is.

163
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,916
I never really thought about it.

164
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,875
[ATSUSHI]
Yeah, who would be in charge?

165
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:49,083
I'm guessing it would
have to be Rampo.

166
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:51,083
He has the longest and
most reliable record.

167
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:52,666
[RAMPO]
Nope. Not me!

168
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,333
[JUNICHIROU, KENJI]
Hm?

169
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:56,125
When it comes to
responsibilities,

170
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:59,000
I can't say I have
a shred of interest.

171
00:09:59,083 --> 00:09:59,958
That's for sure.

172
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:02,166
[JUNICHIROU]
Hmm, then...

173
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,375
It'd have to be Dazai.

174
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:06,250
Well? Am I right?

175
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:10,125
[OSAMU]
What have I missed?

176
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:12,541
What else can I do to
annoy Kunikida to death?

177
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:13,958
What?!

178
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:17,625
[ATSUSHI] He's not done
tormenting him yet?

179
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:19,333
[AYA]
All right, Kunikida!

180
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:21,750
Let's go catch that dung bucket!

181
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:23,833
My name is Aya Kouda,
by the way.

182
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:26,291
But you can call me Aya.

183
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:28,500
My precious agenda...

184
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:30,166
It's all gone up in smoke.

185
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:31,416
Sheesh.

186
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,500
You special detectives
aren't nearly as cool

187
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:34,833
as all the rumors.

188
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:36,708
You need to
toughen up, Kunikida!

189
00:10:36,791 --> 00:10:39,166
[DOPPO] That's Mr. Kunikida
to you, Miss Kouda.

190
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:41,666
[AYA]
Just call me Aya.

191
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,750
If your agenda's so important,

192
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:48,375
what made did you jump off the
train to help me back there?

193
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:49,666
[DOPPO]
My ideals.

194
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,083
Huh?

195
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:52,791
[DOPPO]
I strive to create a world

196
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:55,791
where no one gets
murdered on my watch.

197
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:58,250
That is my ideal.

198
00:10:58,333 --> 00:10:59,875
Huh?

199
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:01,458
What's with that face?

200
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:04,000
You're so sappy. It's
embarrassing to listen to you.

201
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:05,250
[DOPPO]
Oh, shut up!

202
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:06,916
Weren't you the one who
was just talking about

203
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,333
"fighting for justice"?!

204
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:10,208
Kunikida.

205
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:12,083
[DOPPO]
That's Mr. Kunikida!

206
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:13,041
What is it?!

207
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:14,458
[AYA]
Look at that.

208
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:20,250
[AYA]
Another bomb?

209
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:23,333
This device is likely
set off by vibrations.

210
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:27,375
I think you had
better stand back.

211
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:29,750
If a train were to pass
over these tracks,

212
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:31,125
hundreds of people would die

213
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:33,958
from the explosion
and derailment.

214
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:37,041
We need a bomb disposal
unit on the scene.

215
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:41,083
This explosive design is
rather familiar however...

216
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:42,750
Could it be...?

217
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:48,083
[DOPPO] If I'm right, this bomb
will have to be disarmed

218
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:50,750
using a remote control.

219
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:51,958
Aya?

220
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:09,250
[click]

221
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:12,791
[gasps]

222
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:21,541
[DOPPO]
Aya!

223
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:24,750
[MAN] I suggest you
put down your weapon.

224
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:28,291
Unless, of course...
you wanna find out how far

225
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:32,333
the girl will fly once
I hit the detonator.

226
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:35,458
I'm awfully curious myself.

227
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:46,166
That's the Kunikida I know!

228
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,833
[MAN]
This is a beautiful little item.

229
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:09,958
Your ability lets
you materialize

230
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:13,250
whatever you write
in this notebook.

231
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:16,916
That means, if I take this
notebook away from you,

232
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,833
you're left powerless.

233
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:21,708
You've done your homework.

234
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:24,666
Well, I am up against
the great Kunikida.

235
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:26,541
Of course I did.

236
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:29,875
I've worked real hard on this
plot for two long years.

237
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:35,541
Shousaku Katsura.
I knew it was you.

238
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:38,416
I arrested you when you were
building an illegal explosive

239
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:42,250
to try and blow up your school
building two years ago.

240
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:44,958
So you were the one who
tipped off the Agency.

241
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:46,458
This was all just a setup

242
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:50,250
in order for you to exact
your revenge, wasn't it?

243
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:52,083
Revenge?

244
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:53,458
Not quite.

245
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:58,250
All I care about is one thing:
To erase your words.

246
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:03,458
After you arrested me, you kept
telling me over and over again,

247
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:05,166
"Overcome adversity."

248
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:06,583
"Be strong."

249
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:09,208
"Discipline yourself
and do what is right."

250
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:15,708
To this day... I still can't
get your ideals out of my mind.

251
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:19,041
"Be strong"?! Where did you
get off telling me that?

252
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:20,916
"Weak! So weak!"

253
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,375
That's the crap advice
you spout to someone

254
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:26,166
who's already so weak
he's become a criminal?!

255
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:28,291
I can still hear you!

256
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:30,083
Do you really think
that people are weak

257
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:31,916
because they want to be?!

258
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:40,625
[SHOUSAKU]
Now's not the time

259
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:43,708
to be sleeping on
the job, Kunikida.

260
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:47,750
There's five minutes until the
train passes over those tracks.

261
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:52,500
The signal to disarm can only
be sent from this laptop.

262
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:54,875
You'll be powerless
to stop the explosion,

263
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:56,875
leaving hundreds to die.

264
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:59,500
When that happens,
those frivolous ideals

265
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:02,541
that you've scribbled into this
precious notebook of yours,

266
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:04,875
along with your pride in
being an Armed Detective,

267
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:06,000
will be lost.

268
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:07,625
Kunikida!

269
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:13,791
[DOPPO]
That's Mr. Kunikida.

270
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:17,625
Katsura... what I have to
say to you in response

271
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:21,333
is already written
there in that book.

272
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:24,500
You can find it
written on page 89.

273
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,041
[DOPPO]
Special ability...

274
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:32,750
Doppo Poetry!

275
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:34,958
Stun Grenade!

276
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:37,208
But he's not even holding it!

277
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:43,500
[MAN A]
Huh?

278
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:48,250
What was that noise?

279
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:49,666
I dunno.

280
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:53,958
The hell?

281
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:58,708
[DOPPO]
That's my answer.

282
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,541
My ability has grown
stronger over time.

283
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:05,125
Ideals can't be attained
through conviction alone.

284
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:06,958
Aya, are you all right?

285
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:08,208
Kunikida!

286
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:11,041
Don't worry about me,
take care of the bombs!

287
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:13,125
Hurry!

288
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:15,333
[DOPPO]
Okay. Just hang tight.

289
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:21,125
[gasps] This isn't good...

290
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:23,250
[SHOUSAKU laughs]

291
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:24,333
Kunikida?

292
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:26,208
Don't move, Aya.

293
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:28,916
[SHOUSAKU]
That's right...

294
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,041
[laughs]

295
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:33,916
The signal to disarm the
bombs set on the track

296
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,458
is the same frequency

297
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:39,583
as the one to detonate the
bomb attached to that girl.

298
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:43,708
[SHOUSAKU]
I wouldn't do that.

299
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:49,291
If you try to remove it
by force, it'll explode.

300
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:52,666
Which means, you have
to make a decision

301
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:55,125
whether you want
to save the girl,

302
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:58,041
or the passengers on the train.

303
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:05,750
Shousaku... you anticipated
this, didn't you?

304
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:08,291
[SHOUSAKU] You told me that
you'd never allow anyone

305
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:10,833
to die in front of your eyes.

306
00:17:10,916 --> 00:17:13,833
That's one of your
"ideals," isn't it?

307
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:16,875
But between hundreds of
passengers and one girl,

308
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:19,000
can you really hold
true to that?

309
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:20,125
[AYA gasps]

310
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:25,791
[SHOUSAKU]
Now... kill that girl,

311
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:27,708
and prove to me that your ideals

312
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:30,833
are nothing more than
a childish fantasy.

313
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:33,333
That you're nothing more
than a flawed human being,

314
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:35,125
just like I am!

315
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:39,541
[DOPPO]
You're right.

316
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:44,833
As hard as we try to stop it,
people die all around us.

317
00:17:44,916 --> 00:17:47,583
It's inescapable.

318
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:51,791
Cruel, heartless, and
without a hint of perfection.

319
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:53,791
That is our world.

320
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:58,708
[DOPPO] But even if the
future seems bleak...

321
00:17:58,791 --> 00:18:02,791
...even if it appears to offer
nothing but pain and misery...

322
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:05,541
...I will still
pursue my ideals.

323
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:11,083
That's right. Your only option
is to sacrifice the girl.

324
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:16,500
Aya... I'm sorry.

325
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:20,500
It's all right.

326
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:24,416
After all, I told you
I fight for justice.

327
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,583
What're you doing?!

328
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:30,250
I'll be here right alongside
you until the very end.

329
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:57,958
[SHOUSAKU]
So that's how your life ends...

330
00:18:58,041 --> 00:19:00,416
Dying along with that girl.

331
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:05,083
[SHOUSAKU]
What?

332
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:08,333
Impossible...

333
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:09,958
How are you alive?!

334
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:13,250
Guess you didn't do enough
research after all.

335
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:16,291
[gasps]

336
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:21,041
[DOPPO]
In the Armed Detective Agency,

337
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:23,125
fatal injuries aren't an issue.

338
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:25,083
I've lost track of how
many times I've heard

339
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:27,583
that "stun grenade"
move of yours.

340
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:33,541
My detailed schedule covers
not just myself, but everyone.

341
00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:36,375
I knew that she would
be shopping nearby.

342
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:42,083
So... you're saying that trick
with the stun grenade...

343
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:45,000
...was actually used
as a distress signal.

344
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:46,750
[AYA]
Seriously?

345
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:50,708
What were you gonna do if
no one came to help in time?

346
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:52,708
[DOPPO]
Find another way.

347
00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:59,708
I already told you.
I won't let anyone die.

348
00:19:59,791 --> 00:20:01,041
No one.

349
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:10,750
[CHUUYA]
No, Boss, it's nothing.

350
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:13,375
Looks like someone with a
grudge against the Agency

351
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:16,458
cooked up a harebrained attack.

352
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:18,416
I would've enjoyed the show more

353
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:22,416
if he'd gone after that idiot
Dazai instead of Kunikida.

354
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,541
But that thug wouldn't
have stood a chance

355
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:26,666
against Dazai anyway.

356
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:32,083
[AYA]
Hey, Kunikida?

357
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:32,958
[DOPPO]
Mm?

358
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:34,916
I'm sure that someone like you,

359
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,625
who's only focused
on your ideals

360
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:39,791
wouldn't have a
girlfriend... or wife.

361
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:42,625
But if you ever
changed your mind...

362
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:46,166
...ya know... I could, uh...

363
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:47,500
[DOPPO]
Aya...

364
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,458
Of the current 58 conditions
of my Spousal Plan Project,

365
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:58,041
you fail to meet
31 of them.

366
00:20:58,125 --> 00:20:59,083
So I must decline.

367
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:00,333
[AYA]
What?!

368
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:02,958
[DOPPO] And for the last
time, it's Mr. Kunikida.

369
00:21:03,041 --> 00:21:06,333
You must respect your elders in
order to become a proper lad--

370
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:18,583
[CHIEF TANEDA]
The older you get,

371
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:21,666
the more you can't help
but worry about the future.

372
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:25,416
[YUKICHI]
Thank you.

373
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,708
[CHIEF TANEDA] I understand that
the Gifted Business Permit

374
00:21:28,791 --> 00:21:32,208
was given to you
personally, Mr. Fukuzawa.

375
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,458
Maybe I shouldn't be concerned.

376
00:21:34,541 --> 00:21:37,541
But I do worry the Armed
Detective Agency--

377
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:40,875
if something unspeakable
were to happen to you...

378
00:21:41,916 --> 00:21:44,750
[YUKICHI] Naturally,
I have considered that:

379
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:48,000
The future of the
Agency after my death.

380
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:54,250
[OSAMU] Who will be the next
president of the Agency?

381
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:55,750
Actually...

382
00:21:57,291 --> 00:21:59,166
Someone's already been chosen.

383
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:00,166
[KENJI]
Huh?

384
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:02,083
I didn't know that.

385
00:22:02,166 --> 00:22:03,625
Who is it then?

386
00:22:03,708 --> 00:22:05,500
[chuckles]

387
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:08,333
He's the perfect
flag bearer for us.

388
00:22:08,416 --> 00:22:13,166
Unwavering, unyielding, and
compassionate toward the weak.

389
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:15,416
A man born to be a leader.

390
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,791
Yup... Who else could it be...

391
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:20,541
...but our very own Kunikida?
