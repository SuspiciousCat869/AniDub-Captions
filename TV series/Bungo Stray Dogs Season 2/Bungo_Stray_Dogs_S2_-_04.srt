Good night... Kosuke.

[ODA]
Good night... Katsumi.

[ODA]
Good night... Yu.

Good night... Shinji.

00:00:39,166 --> 00:00:42,500
[ODA]
Good night... Sakura.

6
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:46,333
[ODA]
Rest in peace.

7
00:00:49,791 --> 00:00:51,583
[ODA]
I'll be off.

8
00:00:55,833 --> 00:00:57,041
[ANGO] I'd like to
start by thanking you

9
00:00:57,125 --> 00:00:58,666
for coming here today.

10
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:03,000
To reiterate, this meeting
will be off the record.

11
00:01:03,083 --> 00:01:05,791
I appreciate your invitation.

12
00:01:05,875 --> 00:01:09,000
How does it feel to be
back at your original post?

13
00:01:09,083 --> 00:01:10,333
[CHIEF TANEDA]
I'll ask you to not torment

14
00:01:10,416 --> 00:01:13,041
our junior staff member,
if you would.

15
00:01:13,125 --> 00:01:15,625
That al lright with you,
Mr. Bossman?

16
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:16,916
My darling Elise wanted me

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,750
to bring back some
ice cream for her.

18
00:01:19,833 --> 00:01:21,000
Any good suggestions

19
00:01:21,083 --> 00:01:24,500
as a government employee,
Chief Taneda?

20
00:01:24,583 --> 00:01:27,666
Now you're making
me feel all warm and toasty.

21
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:29,583
That reminds me actually...

22
00:01:29,666 --> 00:01:32,083
I should bring something
back for our people.

23
00:01:32,166 --> 00:01:34,625
Something they'd
really appreciate,

24
00:01:34,708 --> 00:01:37,458
like your head on
a silver platter.

25
00:01:38,666 --> 00:01:42,333
If we may, I'd like to proceed
with the negotiations.

26
00:01:42,416 --> 00:01:44,958
Of Mister Mori, the Gifted
Operations Division

27
00:01:45,041 --> 00:01:47,583
has two requests:
To begin with,

28
00:01:47,666 --> 00:01:50,625
the Port Mafia will yield
any interest in myself,

29
00:01:50,708 --> 00:01:52,958
and will not harm my person.

30
00:01:53,041 --> 00:01:54,666
And secondly, they will dispose

31
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,708
of the gifted
organization Mimic,

32
00:01:56,791 --> 00:01:59,250
who has illegally
entered our country.

33
00:01:59,333 --> 00:02:02,458
I have no qualms
regarding the first request.

34
00:02:02,541 --> 00:02:05,375
The second one is a bit
more difficult, however.

35
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:10,333
After all, they certainly are
quite a terrifying bunch.

36
00:02:10,416 --> 00:02:14,416
Well, can you make
it worth our while?

37
00:02:27,791 --> 00:02:28,833
Heh...

38
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:39,166
[laughs]

39
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:44,916
[OSAMU]
Odasaku...

40
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:49,166
[OSAMU] I know what
you're thinking right now.

41
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:52,583
But you can't do it,
even if you did, it--

42
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:55,250
[ODA] "It wouldn't
bring the kids back."

43
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:57,250
That's what you
were gonna say, right?

44
00:02:57,333 --> 00:03:00,458
[OSAMU] They still rival us
in terms of sheer numbers.

45
00:03:00,541 --> 00:03:01,791
And then their
location makes them--

46
00:03:01,875 --> 00:03:03,125
[ODA]
You don't have to tell me...

47
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:04,791
I already know.

48
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:07,166
They sent me an "invitation."

49
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:08,708
[OSAMU]
Listen to me.

50
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:12,375
The boss had a meeting with
the Gifted Operations Division.

51
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:14,583
I'm not sure what it was about.

52
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:18,125
But I have a feeling
there's more going on here.

53
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:22,041
That has nothing to
do with me anymore.

54
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:23,875
I'm finished with all this.

55
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:27,625
[OSAMU] Odasaku, I know this is
the last thing you wanna hear,

56
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:29,291
but now more than ever,

57
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:32,541
go find a new
purpose anything at all.

58
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:35,541
Find something to pursue
and follow where it goes.

59
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:38,208
I know there's more
out there for you.

60
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:43,041
[OSAMU] Hey, did I ever tell
you why I joined the Port Mafia

61
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:46,541
in the first place?

62
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:50,083
I had hoped it would
help me find my purpose.

63
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:53,916
Death and carnage,
hope and despair...

64
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,166
...I wanted a way to observe
humanity's true nature,

65
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:00,916
and there's no better
place than a battlefield.

66
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,958
That will to live...

67
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:08,875
...I thought that being around
it would help me find my own.

68
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,666
[ODA]
My dream was to become a writer.

69
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,000
I was afraid if
I ever killed again,

70
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:17,833
I'd lose that future forever.

71
00:04:17,916 --> 00:04:19,916
That's why I stopped.

72
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:22,125
[OSAMU]
Odasaku...

73
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:23,833
[ODA]
But that dream is gone.

74
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:25,791
Don't go! Please!

75
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:34,708
[ODA] There's only
one thing left that I want.

76
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,666
Odasaku!

77
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:56,416
Whoa!

78
00:04:58,791 --> 00:05:00,833
[RAMPO]
Hey! What the big idea, huh?!

79
00:05:00,916 --> 00:05:03,291
You should take a moment to look
where you're going next time!

80
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:04,375
You could've damaged

81
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:06,916
these precious detective
tools of mine.

82
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,333
[ODA]
Detective, huh?

83
00:05:08,416 --> 00:05:09,916
Not any detective!

84
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,125
I'm a genius!

85
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:13,041
And soon there won't
be anyobody in Japan

86

who doesn't know my name!

87
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:16,875
I am the best
detective the world

88
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:18,166
has ever known, Rampo Edo--

89
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,500
[ODA]
Sorry I asked.

90
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:24,750
[RAMPO] You'll take me seriously
once you experience my ability!

91
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:28,208
Don't be writing
me off just yet!

Let's see...

93
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:37,208
I know the two of us
have only just met,

94
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:40,500
but it's very unwise to go
where you're headed right now.

95
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:44,375
You should reconsider.

96
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:47,958
If you go there, you'll die.

97
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:51,125
[ODA]
Yeah...

98
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:54,083
[ODA]
I know.

Yes... kill me.

Do you have any last words?

105
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:37,500
Thank you for...
a glorious battle...

106
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:40,666
Our leader...
is still up ahead...

107
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:45,958
Please... save him as
well from this nightmare.

Well, if isn't Dazai!

112
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:02,125
How rare of you to come visit.

113
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:04,500
[OSAMU] Boss... I'd like
to request permission

114
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:08,833
to organize a gifted
squad to save Odasaku.

115
00:08:08,916 --> 00:08:11,291
[OUGAI]
Very well. Permission granted.

116
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:14,625
But first, may I ask
why you're doing this?

117
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:17,458
Even as we speak,
he's out there all alone,

118
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:20,375
fighting against Mimic
at their headquarters.

119
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:25,958
If we do nothing, we will surely
lose a valuable gifted agent.

120
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:28,166
[OUGAI] I understand
what you're saying,

121
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,708
but I very much doubt
Oda has any intention

122

of being saved by anyone.

123

I don't believe you'd disagree.

124
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:41,458
Listen, Dazai,
as the leader here,

125
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:43,666
I am both the pinnacle
of this organization,

as well as its servant.

For the sake of our survival,

I must make whatever
sacrifices are necessary,

and the Special Black Ops
or to be more precise,

161
00:10:56,916 --> 00:10:59,541
the Gifted Special
Operations Division...

162
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:01,208
It always felt
like this conflict

163
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:04,166
was being controlled by someone.

164
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:06,333
Such a bold and intricate design

165
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:09,458
could've only been attributed
to your handiwork.

166
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:11,500
That black envelope
there was your reward

167
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:14,791
for that brilliant piece
of engineering.

168
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:18,083
No matter how powerful
the Port Mafia may become,

169
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:19,958
we will always exist
with the weight

170
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:23,583
of the Gifted Special Operations
Division bearing down on us

171
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:27,958
in perpetual fear
of inciting their ire.

172
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:31,541
So you made a deal
to wipe Mimic off the map.

173
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:35,750
And in return, they would agree
to issue this permit to you.

174
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:38,083
Our organization
would benefit immensely

175
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:43,083
with this in your possession
the Gifted Business Permit.

176
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:11,708
Sakunosuke... you're exquisite!

177
00:12:11,791 --> 00:12:14,416
I'll accompany you to your end.

178
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:31,458
[ODA]
What?

179
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:38,500
[ODA] Is this the ability's
singularity that Ango mentioned?

180
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:43,833
This is the future
I sought to realize.

181
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:45,666
Why did you want this?

182
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:48,541
Why did you decide
to abstain from killing?

183
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:52,791
My dream was to become a writer.

184
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:56,958
A man told me long ago...
that was my true calling.

185
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:59,458
He gave me a very rare book.

186
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:01,208
It was the
conclusion to a series,

187
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:04,333
that I was never able to find.

188
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:12,125
The man told me it was
completely uninspired.

189
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:15,583
[GIDE] And what was
your impression of it?

190
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:20,000
[ODA] I thought... it was
an absolutely wonderful story.

191
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:24,208
[OSAMU]
Boss, you were the one

192
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:27,458
who helped Mimic enter
this country illegally.

193
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:30,958
You invited them to Yokohama in
order to prompt the Ministry's

194
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:35,958
Gifted Operations Division
to finally take action.

195
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:37,416
[OUGAI]
Correct.

196
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:41,708
As a result, we now possess
this very coveted permit.

197
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:45,666
This practically legalizes a
great many of our activities

198
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,833
giving our people a safe haven,

199
00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:51,750
while Oda tidies up the loose
ends at the cost of his life.

200
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:53,916
This is a true victory.

201
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,708
Yet telling by your face, you
don't seem to be happy about it.

202
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:02,666
Those orphans that Odasaku
worked so hard to take care of,

203
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:05,750
you told Mimic
about them, didn't you?

204
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:08,083
You needed the cooperation
of the only person

205
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:10,250
who could be a match
for their leader.

206
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:12,916
That's why you manipulated him.

207
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,291
Just a moment.

208
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:22,833
You're not leaving quite yet.

209
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:24,833
Explain yourself.

210
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:30,708
[OUGAI] What possible benefit is
there in going to his aid now?

211
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:35,375
[OSAMU] There are two things
that I wish to say to you, Boss.

212
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:39,791
First off, you won't have
your men gun me down.

213
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:43,583
Nor will you do
the job yourself.

214
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:45,583
[OUGAI]
What makes you so certain?

215
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:48,375
[OSAMU]
You gain nothing by doing so.

216
00:14:48,458 --> 00:14:49,833
[OUGAI]
In the same fashion,

217
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:52,583
I believe you have nothing
to gain by defying me

218
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:54,541
and rushing to his side.

219
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:57,750
[OSAMU] That brings me
to my second item.

220
00:14:57,833 --> 00:15:01,541
There may be no
political gain to be had,

221
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:05,625
even so, I do have
a reason to leave.

222
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:11,375
Because Odasaku's my friend.

223
00:15:30,791 --> 00:15:33,583
[ODA] The last book
in the series was magnificent,

224
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:35,708
but there was one issue.

225
00:15:35,791 --> 00:15:40,250
Several pages had been
cut out near the end of it.

226
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:43,250
[NATSUME]
Then why don't you write it?

227
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:46,583
[ODA] Just before the
missing section in question,

228
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:49,458
there was the
following paragraph:

229
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:52,875
"People live only
to save themselves.

230
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:57,250
You will understand this at
the moment of your own death."

231
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:01,791
[ODA]
As I think back on that day,

232
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:03,041
I'm almost certain the man

233
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:06,500
who gave me that book
knew I was a hit man.

234
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:07,958
I think his intention

235
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:12,500
from the beginning was to
persuade me to stop killing.

236
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:14,416
When the two of us first met,

237
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:17,125
he introduced himself
and told me his name.

238
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:19,500
I had long forgotten it.

239
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:23,666
But I finally was able to
remember after all this time.

240
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,958
Just who are you anyway?

241
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:27,666
[STRANGER]
Who am I?

242
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:31,250
My name is Soseki Natsume.

243
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:32,875
[ODA]
That's right.

244
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:37,583
He had the same name as
the author of the story I loved.

245
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:42,166
[GIDE]
I was once considered a hero.

246
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:44,458
I fought to protect my home,

247
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:48,375
considering it my
God-given duty to uphold.

248
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:51,958
In the last Great War,
my squad of 40 defeated

249
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:56,625
an army of 600 who were
holed up in a fortress.

250
00:16:56,708 --> 00:17:01,583
But the truth was, all of it
was a setup by our allies.

251
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:05,541
At the time, our country was
already entering peace talks.

252
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:09,166
We were used to seize
an enemy transit network

253
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:14,041
after negotiations
had concluded.

254
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:18,375
In response, our actions
were deemed a war crime.

255
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:19,958
We were seen as terrorists

256
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:23,041
by those we once
considered colleagues.

257
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:31,791
Some of my men resorted
to taking their own lives.

258
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:33,291
But there were those of us

259
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:36,166
who would not meet
our end so easily.

260
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:42,791
We not only lost our homeland,
but our honor as well.

261
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:46,250
We became cursed
to wander a barren wasteland

262
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:49,875
in the hopes of
finding a worthy battle.

263
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:51,791
Could you really not
have saved yourself

264
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:54,250
by changing your way of life?

265
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:58,625
I swore an oath to my men that
I would die as the soldier I am.

266
00:17:58,708 --> 00:18:01,875
I can't be anything else.

267
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:07,208
No... perhaps you're right,
Sakunosuke.

268
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:10,708
In some other life, I may have
been able to reshape myself

269
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:14,208
into someone
who wasn't a soldier.

270
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:18,625
Just like how you became
a man who didn't kill.

271
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:21,625
I do have one thing
which I regret.

272
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:24,583
I never got to say
goodbye to someone.

273
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,791
In this dark world,

274
00:18:26,875 --> 00:18:30,750
he was the only person
I would consider my friend.

275
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:33,416
But he seemed tired
of this existence

276
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,583
and was waiting for the end.

277
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:37,833
Was he in search
of death like me?

278
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:41,166
A way to escape this place?

279
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,166
Not quite.

280
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:45,916
His search was different.

281
00:18:57,291 --> 00:18:59,291
[GIDE]
Sakunosuke...

282
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:01,125
You were perfect.

283
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:04,500
Even your very
last shot was sublime.

284
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:17,208
[OSAMU]
Odasaku!

285
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:26,250
[OSAMU]
I can't believe you...

286
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:28,291
You're such an idiot!

287
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:30,166
Yeah...

288
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:34,541
[OSAMU] Why did you
give him what he wanted?!

289
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:35,958
[ODA]
Dazai...

290
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:39,666
I have... something
I need to tell you.

291
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:40,708
You can't!

292
00:19:40,791 --> 00:19:42,000
Not like this!

293
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:43,750
You can tell me about it later.

294
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:45,083
You're going to make it!

295
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:46,666
So don't talk like you're--

296
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:49,166
Listen.

297
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,125
Remember how you told me

298
00:19:51,208 --> 00:19:54,333
that you subjected yourself
to violence and bloodshed

299
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:57,791
because it might help you
to find some reason to exist.

300
00:19:57,875 --> 00:19:58,958
[OSAMU]
Yeah, I did...

301
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:00,875
But who cares about that now?!

302
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:02,416
You're not gonna find it.

303
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,708
[gasps]

304
00:20:03,791 --> 00:20:05,916
[ODA] Deep down,
you know that it's true.

305
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,083
Whether you're on the
side who kills people

306
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:11,458
or the side that protects them,

307
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:14,750
you won't find
what you're seeking.

308
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:17,750
Nothing in this world will be

309
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:22,125
able to fill the
loneliness inside you.

310
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:27,208
Try as you might, that
darkness will always be there.

311
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:35,166
[OSAMU] Odasaku...
tell me what I should do.

312
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:39,166
[ODA]
Be someone that protects people.

313
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:40,708
[gasps]

314
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:44,708
If both sides are the same to
you, then become a good man.

315
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:48,958
Protect the vulnerable...
help out some orphans.

316
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:50,333
I know that the concept

317
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:53,458
of good and evil doesn't
mean much to you.

318
00:20:53,541 --> 00:20:55,041
But at least,

319
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:58,416
it would make your world
a little more beautiful.

320
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,583
You can't know that.

321
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:02,500
[ODA]
Of course I can,

322
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:05,083
I'm certain of it.

323
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:11,000
Because... I know
my friend better than anyone.

324
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:18,166
All right, I'll do it.

325
00:21:19,208 --> 00:21:20,666
It's funny...

326
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:26,000
The story I read said people
only live to save themselves.

327
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:27,708
It's true...

328
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:31,375
I understand that now.

329
00:22:10,291 --> 00:22:12,958
[door opens]

330
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:15,250
[OSAMU] I never thought I'd
find such an important figure

331
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:17,041
from the Ministry here.

332
00:22:17,125 --> 00:22:18,958
All by yourself in a cheap bar.

333
00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:20,875
How very lonely.

334
00:22:20,958 --> 00:22:21,916
[CHIEF TANEDA]
Wait, are you...?

335
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,625
[OSAMU]
Now, now, have a drink...

336
00:22:23,708 --> 00:22:25,583
I heard rumors
that you disappeared

337
00:22:25,666 --> 00:22:29,166
and gone underground
for a while.

338
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:32,041
I guess you could say
I'm back on the job market.

339
00:22:32,125 --> 00:22:35,000
I was hoping you might have
heard of some good openings.

340
00:22:35,083 --> 00:22:37,208
I could offer you a job with us.

341
00:22:37,291 --> 00:22:38,291
Would that interest you?

342
00:22:38,375 --> 00:22:40,208
I'm afraid that
wouldn't work for me.

343
00:22:40,291 --> 00:22:44,125
I don't care much for workplaces
that have a lot of rules.

344
00:22:44,208 --> 00:22:46,583
Then what exactly
are you looking for?

345
00:22:46,666 --> 00:22:49,125
Somewhere where
I'd be able to help people.

346
00:22:49,208 --> 00:22:50,958
Huh?

347
00:22:51,041 --> 00:22:53,625
Hmm...

348
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:57,875
I wish I could tell you
I'd help you out,

349
00:22:57,958 --> 00:23:00,833
but you have a
very sordid history.

350
00:23:00,916 --> 00:23:04,875
You'll need another two years
underground for a clean slate.

351
00:23:04,958 --> 00:23:06,458
But after that,

352
00:23:06,541 --> 00:23:09,875
I just may have a lead
that would interest you.

353
00:23:12,333 --> 00:23:14,750
Well, let's hear it then.

354
00:23:17,291 --> 00:23:19,500
[CHIEF TANEDA] I happen to
know of an armed organization

355
00:23:19,583 --> 00:23:22,333
of gifted individuals
that take on cases

356
00:23:22,416 --> 00:23:25,541
residing in a legal grey area.

357
00:23:25,625 --> 00:23:29,250
The president of the company
is a great man of integrity.

358
00:23:29,333 --> 00:23:31,916
I have a feeling you'd like him.

359
00:23:35,458 --> 00:23:37,666
[OSAMU]
Will I be able to save people?

360
00:23:48,166 --> 00:23:49,333
[ATSUSHI]
Kyouka's first job

361
00:23:49,416 --> 00:23:51,875
in the Armed Detective
Agency was a simple one:

362
00:23:51,958 --> 00:23:54,625
Deliver documents
to the court house.

363
00:23:54,708 --> 00:23:57,041
At least, that's
what we thought.

364
00:23:57,125 --> 00:24:00,833
[KYOUKA] My specialty is to
lure people into a secluded area

365
00:24:00,916 --> 00:24:02,291
and then kill them.

366
00:24:02,375 --> 00:24:04,458
[ATSUSHI]
Don't think about that stuff!

367
00:24:04,541 --> 00:24:08,208
Meanwhile, Kyouka is followed
by members of the Port Mafia,

368
00:24:08,291 --> 00:24:11,708
and a new, even deadlier
enemy emerges.

369
