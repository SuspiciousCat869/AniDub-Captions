1
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:11,916
[KOUYOU] Flowers that
bloom within the darkness

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,958
can only be at peace
within the darkness.

3
00:00:21,791 --> 00:00:24,666
Falling flower petals
are so beautiful.

4
00:00:28,125 --> 00:00:32,416
[KOUYOU] There is no need to let
blossoms fall before they bloom.

5
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,750
[JUNICHIROU]
Sorry to keep you waiting.

6
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:15,875
I made curry rice today.

7
00:02:15,958 --> 00:02:17,291
It looks so delicious!

8
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:18,666
You're the best, Bro!

9
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,083
[JUNICHIROU]
Oh, that's right!

10
00:02:20,166 --> 00:02:22,375
Thanks for the meal!

11
00:02:24,208 --> 00:02:26,041
Oh, I forgot to ask you...

12
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:28,333
...you did buy that German
cake we saw yesterday

13
00:02:28,416 --> 00:02:30,625
at that place near
the harbor, right?

14
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:31,833
[JUNICHIROU]
Oh!

15
00:02:31,916 --> 00:02:33,416
You forgot, didn't you...

16
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,291
Jeez!

17
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:35,541
What did I tell you?

18
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:38,291
I really wanted to
have it ready for today!

19
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:40,666
[JUNICHIROU]
Oh, sorry...

20
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,208
So, that cake...

21
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:45,666
Did you mean this one?

22
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:51,625
[NAOMI]
Oh, you little rascal.

23
00:02:51,708 --> 00:02:53,083
You're gonna to get it now!

24
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:54,250
[JUNICHIROU]
Oh! Hey!

25
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:58,708
Watch it! Ah!
That's tickles! Ha ha! Oh!

26
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:02,500
[NAOMI]
Hey...

27
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:04,875
Do you really have
to work while we eat?

28
00:03:04,958 --> 00:03:06,083
[JUNICHIROU]
I'm looking over these records

29
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:08,791
from the city police
involving Kyouka.

30
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:10,125
Is it true that
she was an orphan

31
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:12,625
before the Port Mafia
took her in?

32
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:15,541
Yeah, and there's
more to it than that.

33
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:18,833
It says her
parents were killed...

34
00:03:18,916 --> 00:03:21,500
...and the one
responsible was...

35
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:27,166
[door opens]

36
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:30,291
Sorry for the wait.

37
00:03:30,375 --> 00:03:32,250
I have your case ready.

38
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:36,166
I also got you this
stun-gun, just in case.

39
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:40,041
With the Port Mafia still after
you, you can't be too careful.

40
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:43,541
Though... this time at least,
I don't think you have to worry.

41
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:45,041
[KYOUKA]
What's the job?

42
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:47,500
All you have to do is deliver
this envelope of evidence

43
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:49,333
to a judge in court.

44
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:52,666
Oh... this is what
he looks like.

45
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:53,833
Understood.

46
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:55,625
I've memorized his face.

47
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:57,291
[ATSUSHI]
You're really into this!

48
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:59,666
Is it 'cause
it's your first job?

49
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,666
[KYOUKA]
No...

50
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,250
The first job I ever had

51
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:06,833
was infiltrating a building
and assassinating two people.

52
00:04:06,916 --> 00:04:08,333
[ATSUSHI]
That's right...

53
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:10,708
She's always had to work.

54
00:04:10,791 --> 00:04:13,583
[AKUTAGAWA] Demon Snow
is the ability to kill.

55
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:15,791
Only by upholding
this responsibility

56
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:20,000
does Kyouka have any purpose.

57
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:21,125
[KYOUKA]
I'll do my best.

58
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:22,833
Huh?

59
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:24,458
I promise.

60
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:29,583
Why can't I go in?

61
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:31,250
[GUARD]
You need a permit.

62
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:33,750
But they're expecting
me right now.

63
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:35,625
[GUARD] If you like,
you can sign in on that form

64
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:38,333
and wait until you're called.

65
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:40,416
But they're expecting me now.

66
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,833
I can't change the rules.

67
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:53,416
No luck, the judge
isn't picking up.

68
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,541
Guess there was some
miscommunication.

69
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:59,500
Looks like we'll have to do
something about that guard.

70
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:00,166
Kill him?

71
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,750
[ATSUSHI]
Huh?!

72
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:03,250
[KYOUKA]
First, I'll use my charms

73
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:05,750
to lure him into
an isolated area...

74
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:07,333
...and then...

75
00:05:07,416 --> 00:05:11,083
Yeah, well that's not exactly
how we do things at the Agency!

76
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:14,250
In that case, I only know
of one other approach.

77
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:16,541
[ATSUSHI]
Hey, where're you going?!

78
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:30,833
[alarm ringing]

79
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:32,708
What happened?

80
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:37,791
Just where do-- Ah!

81
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:40,791
You wanna tell me what
all this racket's about?

82
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:46,333
[screams]

83
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:50,375
[KYOUKA]
I have a delivery, sir.

84
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:56,416
Uh...

85
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,000
[ATSUSHI]
Here.

86
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:09,250
[ATSUSHI] The President
settled everything.

87
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:11,583
Apparently,
he's friends with the judge.

88
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:12,833
[KYOUKA]
Hmm.

89
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:15,708
It was all going well
until that last part.

90
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:18,458
[ATSUSHI]
Really? Just the last part?

91
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:20,416
Huh?

92
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:24,041
I see you're still
holding on to that phone.

93
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:28,041
[KYOUKA] I had the service
provider make some changes.

94
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:30,583
It's still important to me.

95
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:36,958
Kyouka... there's something
that I wanted to bring up.

96
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:39,583
If we knew more
about your ability...

97
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:41,416
How you could control Demon Snow

98
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,458
without the voice
from the phone,

99
00:06:43,541 --> 00:06:45,583
you could use it for
the Agency instead of--

100
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:47,166
I won't!

101
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,875
Never...

102
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:51,375
I'm never using it again.

103
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:59,958
[phone ringing]

104
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:02,708
[KOUYOU]
Demon Snow...

105
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:07,875
...punish those who would dare
teach Kyouka a world of lies.

106
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:17,166
Even the blood of vermin
is beautiful to behold

107
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,750
when it splatters.

108
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:22,250
There's nothing
else quite like it.

109
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:26,916
Wouldn't you agree, my dear?

110
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,958
Do you have any idea
how sick with worry I was

111
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:32,333
when I found out you were gone?

112
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:36,416
The immense pain...
of knowing my sweet child

113
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:40,583
was out there amongst
animals like this.

114
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:44,458
But there's nothing
to worry about anymore.

115
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:46,750
Now that I'm here
to protect you,

116
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:49,791
everything is going
to be all right.

117
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:52,958
[ATSUSHI] She's not going back
to the Port Mafia with you...

118
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:56,041
She's decided that she
wants to use her strengths

119
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:59,166
to work with us at the Agency.

120
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:07,333
I never should have waited
for Ougai's permission.

121
00:08:07,416 --> 00:08:10,083
Why didn't I come
and get you sooner?

122
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:12,125
I cannot allow you
to remain here

123
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:16,083
in this festering
lair of hypocrisy.

124
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:18,416
You have been led astray
by their beguiling words

125
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,625
and the false promise
of a world full of light.

126
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:23,166
But make no mistake,

127
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:26,333
one day they will ask
you to use Demon Snow.

128
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:27,916
[gasps]

129
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,041
[KOUYOU] I think it's time that
we return home, my dear Kyouka.

130
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:32,208
[ATSUSHI]
Wait...

131
00:08:32,291 --> 00:08:34,791
Where are you taking her?

132
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:39,541
The place where
she belongs... is with us!

133
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:44,208
Not fast enough...

134
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:47,875
[ATSUSHI]
A second demon?

135
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:55,958
[KOUYOU] Perhaps I'll finish
my job first after all.

136
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:57,666
This is where you die.

137
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,625
[KYOUKA]
Stop!

138
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:01,916
[KOUYOU]
It is the wish of Ougai

139
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,541
that all Agency
operatives be eradicated.

140
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:08,375
However, I asked that
you be made an exception,

141
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:11,125
and he agreed
to spare your life.

142
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:13,541
Come back with me, now.

143
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:16,166
You are a flower
born of darkness

144
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,500
and will only find peace there.

145
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:19,791
[KYOUKA]
You're wrong...

146
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:21,916
I'm not a flower of darkness!

147
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,458
[gasps]

148
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,583
You poor child...

149
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:31,291
She has been
blinded by the light...

150
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:34,541
...blinded by the light
that you showed her.

151
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:38,166
But luckily, all is not lost.

152
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:42,125
I doubt you'd wish to stay if he
was no longer with the Agency.

153
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:45,583
Especially if the boy
was killed because of you.

154
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:48,625
[KYOUKA]
All right!

155
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:50,333
I'll come back with you.

156
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:51,958
Just stop this.

157
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:57,041
[KOUYOU] Everything
I've done is for you, Kyouka.

158
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:03,291
[KOUYOU]
One day, you'll understand that.

159
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:09,041
How precious...

160
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:23,625
[KOUYOU chuckles]

161
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:26,375
[KOUYOU]
Well done, my dear.

162
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:29,458
I never saw it coming
for a moment!

163
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:32,625
I've seen the world of light.

164
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:37,416
And I refuse to go back to a
time where it doesn't exist.

165
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:40,041
I would advise
against using that.

166
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:43,125
You know what
will happen if you do...

167
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:45,041
Demon Snow!

168
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:46,916
I ask that you defeat my enemy!

169
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,958
[crash]

170
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:53,625
[STEINBECK]
My darling Rocinante...

171
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:56,958
The roads in this
country are too narrow.

172
00:10:57,041 --> 00:10:59,708
Well then we'll
just have to walk.

173
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:04,250
I'd really like to finish
this job so we can go back.

174
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:07,708
It's been four years
since I was outside.

175
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:09,416
[STEINBECK]
All right then!

176
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,500
Let's go.

177
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:12,791
Our luggage is about to arrive.

178
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:18,625
Finally, you reveal
your true nature!

179
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:21,166
You kill anyone who
dares stand in your way.

180
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:22,416
Just like a demon.

181
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,250
You're wrong!

182
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:25,833
[KOUYOU]
I understand your denial,

183
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:27,375
but a flower that has bloomed

184
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:32,166
within the darkness can only
be at peace within the darkness.

185
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:34,833
Do you know why I know this?

186
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:37,958
There was a woman
who also sought the light,

187
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:40,958
but it burned her and
she fell into darkness.

188
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:44,083
You're coming home.

189
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:47,291
But I don't wanna go back.

190
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:49,416
Even if you're right, I can't!

191
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,416
[KOUYOU] You cannot change your
true nature and you will always

192
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,750
justify killing when
it serves your goals.

193
00:11:55,833 --> 00:12:00,083
That is why you've been able
to wield your ability so deftly.

194
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:03,791
You have always made
good use of your demon.

195
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:07,166
You used it
to kill your parents.

196
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:13,208
[ATSUSHI]
Why... Why, Kyouka?

197
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:14,458
It's not...

198
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:17,083
[KOUYOU]
He will never understand.

199
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:21,083
No one who lives in
this world of light could.

200
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:34,291
You no longer have
to wield that blade

201
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:37,208
in search of a place
where you belong.

202
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:40,416
I will protect you from now on.

203
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:44,416
[KENJI]
Watch your heads, please!

204
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,541
[KOUYOU]
Hm?

205
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:51,041
[KENJI]
Man!

206
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:53,291
It flew so far!

207
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,333
[DOPPO]
Are you okay?

208
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:55,708
[ATSUSHI]
Mr. Kunikida...

209
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:57,000
Why are you here?

210
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:59,291
I made some adjustments
to Kyouka's phone.

211
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:02,000
It notifies me when
someone tries to call it.

212
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:03,500
Now get up.

213
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:06,000
Why're you acting like some
kind of damsel in distress?

214
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:06,875
You're a weretiger.

215
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:09,333
Grow some were-balls.

216
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:11,333
[KOUYOU]
Agency vermin!

217
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:14,708
Do not shine more of
your toxic light on Kyouka!

218
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:17,500
[STEINBECK] Well,
isn't this just great timing!

219
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:20,875
It's like the split second
before a collision.

220
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:24,458
If we had come a little bit
later, we would've had it easy.

221
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:25,666
You still want in?

222
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,958
[LOVECRAFT]
I don't care either way,

223
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:30,875
but all the stares are
making me uncomfortable.

224
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:31,875
[STEINBECK]
Oh, fine.

225
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:33,083
I guess I'll get out there

226
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:35,875
and earn my keep on
behalf of the Guild.

227
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:39,083
[LOVECRAFT] I'm so tired...
and really itchy...

228
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:41,333
...so tired... and itchy...

229
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:44,416
[DOPPO] Are those guys
from the Guild...?

230
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:48,250
[STEINBECK] Oh, keep the
middle clear, would you?

231
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:51,875
Our luggage will
be arriving shortly.

232
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:54,666
Huh? Ah?

233
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,333
What's that?!

234
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,458
Really...? Fire!

235
00:14:11,541 --> 00:14:15,041
[gunfire]

236
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:24,791
[HAWTHORNE]
Oh, that's right...

237
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:27,291
where are Master Poe
and Lady Louisa?

238
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:29,458
[MITCHELL] The two have
have an acute fear of heights,

239
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:31,416
so they decided to stay behind.

240
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,041
They should just die.

241
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:34,875
That was a really easy job.

242
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:36,916
Wouldn't you agree, Reverend?

243
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:41,750
[HAWTHORNE] Lord in Heaven...
have mercy on the wicked.

244
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:03,375
[ATSUSHI]
Where am I?

245
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:07,000
I remember... we were attacked.

246
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:08,458
[AKIKO]
Well, well,

247
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:12,375
that's quite a fatal injury
you've got there, Atsushi.

248
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:15,625
Are you ready
for your treatment?

249
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:20,916
I'll use this one today.

250
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,041
[ATSUSHI screams]

251
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:30,208
Seriously, what am
I gonna do with you guys?

252
00:15:30,291 --> 00:15:31,666
If you didn't have me around,

253
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:35,208
you'd all be six feet
under right about now.

254
00:15:35,291 --> 00:15:37,041
How are you all feeling?

255
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:40,083
President... I apologize.

256
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:41,541
I was too careless.

257
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:42,708
It's fine.

258
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:44,166
I'm heading out.

259
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:47,250
Wait, isn't it too
dangerous right now?

260
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:54,208
[AKIKO] Hmm. Well, someone's
pretty riled up it seems.

261
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:56,208
[OUGAI]
Now, now, my dear,

262
00:15:56,291 --> 00:15:59,166
you really shouldn't be
eating all these sweets.

263
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,875
[ELISE]
Aw, but why not?

264
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:02,583
Sweetness is justice!

265
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:04,375
[OUGAI]
Even so...

266
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:06,916
I'll think of trying on that
dress you bought me earlier

267
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,666
if you let me.

268
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:13,208
Do you want seconds?

269
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:15,791
[CHUUYA] Boss,
we received word that the Agency

270
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:19,583
got to the scene ahead of us
and took Kouyou with them.

271
00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:23,041
Now that one of our top
five executives is a hostage,

272
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:24,416
we have to be careful.

273
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,708
[OUGAI]
Yes, you're correct...

274
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:28,791
All right!

275
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:31,000
Let's kill the president
of the agency!

276
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:33,125
A hit job should do the trick.

277
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:35,291
If we hire outside contractors,

278
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:39,416
we won't have to allocate
our forces and instead,

279
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:42,666
we can focus on
confronting the Guild.

280
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:51,375
[OSAMU]
Hey, Sister.

281
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:53,375
Been awhile, hasn't it?

282
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:57,708
Yes, it certainly has been,
you vile little traitor.

283
00:16:57,791 --> 00:17:00,916
You, boy, is Kyouka safe?

284
00:17:02,916 --> 00:17:05,125
[ATSUSHI]
She's missing.

285
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:08,666
And it's your fault.

286
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:13,958
[KOUYOU laughs]

287
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:16,250
What's so funny?!

288
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:18,791
I ask that you leave
this matter to me.

289
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:22,041
But...

290
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:24,833
Don't worry, I've got this!

291
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:29,166
Now then, sorry to
get right to the point,

292
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:32,041
but I'd like to know the Port
Mafia's current strategy

293
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:33,666
regarding this conflict.

294
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:34,875
[KOUYOU]
Hmph.

295
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:37,625
Don't tell me you've
forgotten our code, boy.

296
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:40,666
Those with loose tongues
are the first to die.

297
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:43,375
[OSAMU] Don't tell me you've
forgotten how I used to fill in

298
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:44,625
for your subordinates

299
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:48,333
who were classified as
"torture specialists."

300
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:51,708
[gasps]

301
00:17:51,791 --> 00:17:53,208
[OSAMU]
Can you recall a single instance

302
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:57,166
where a hostage didn't talk
after I asked the questions?

303
00:17:57,250 --> 00:18:00,333
I'm sorry to say,
this won't be very pretty.

304
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:04,500
[YUKICHI] All operatives are
to leave the company offices

305
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:07,875
and gather at
the former facility.

306
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:09,500
[DOPPO] Do you mean the
your previous headquarters

307
00:18:09,583 --> 00:18:12,666
before you founded the Agency?

308
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:16,875
Only a select few know of that
location, so we should be safe.

309
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:21,333
We risk being overwhelmed by
superior numbers otherwise.

310
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:22,250
[DOPPO]
Sounds like the president

311
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:25,208
is prepared to go to war.

312
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:29,083
Hold on I have visitors...

313
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:32,375
[DOPPO]
Sir? What's going on?

314
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:35,208
[DOPPO]
Sir?

315
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:36,958
Hmm...

316
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:38,541
[ATSUSHI]
What's wrong?

317
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:40,708
Something happened
with the president...

318
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:42,000
Ambushed maybe.

319
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:43,041
Huh?!

320
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:44,375
We should go and help then!

321
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:46,583
[DOPPO] I'm sure he's fine...
more importantly--

322
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:50,333
How can you be so
calm at a time like this?!

323
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:53,291
[DOPPO sighs]

324
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:56,750
Try and grab hold of my hand.

325
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:58,541
You'll see why.

326
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:08,166
That was the first technique
he passed down to me.

327
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:11,750
I've never won a
single match against him.

328
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:16,250
He's not going to lose against a
handful of mediocre hitmen.

329
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:22,333
[YUKICHI] Go back to your master
and tell him it was a nice try.

330
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:26,333
And that he would be wise
to target me and me alone.

331
00:19:31,916 --> 00:19:33,208
[STEINBECK]
Nice shot.

332
00:19:33,291 --> 00:19:35,541
I hear the Agency has
abandoned their headquarters

333
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:37,958
and have hidden somewhere else.

334
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:40,666
It's gonna be tricky
finding their new location.

335
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:44,083
The Port Mafia's
on the move as well.

336
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:45,708
When I was just a boy,

337
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:49,125
I worked for two years in
order to afford a gun like this.

338
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:52,291
When I couldn't,
I killed four people.

339
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:57,750
And now, I own the company that
manufactures these same guns.

340
00:19:57,833 --> 00:20:00,166
Money is the root of all evil.

341
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:02,500
Every time you obtain
something you desire,

342
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:05,125
you lose something in return.

343
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:06,708
In time, the world becomes

344
00:20:06,791 --> 00:20:11,791
as tiresome as blue smoke
rising from burning leaves

345
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:14,166
And that's the reason, John...

346
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:17,291
...that I can honestly say...

347
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:19,833
...my world has
never been brighter.

348
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:32,333
I'll see to it that
this city is mine.

349
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:39,833
[door opens]

350
00:20:39,916 --> 00:20:41,041
[YUKICHI]
Listen up.

351
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:43,500
The Port Mafia seeks
to eradicate the Agency.

352
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:46,333
The Guild seeks
to usurp the Agency.

353
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:48,500
We must do all we can
to protect ourselves

354
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:51,250
from both of these foes.

355
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,375
Dazai, please continue.

356
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:55,208
[OSAMU]
You got it!

357
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:57,750
The Guild has substantial
financial assets,

358
00:20:57,833 --> 00:21:00,291
and the Port Mafia has
the benefit of numbers.

359
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:03,708
So, we'll split into defensive
and offensive teams

360
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:06,500
and engage them
in guerrilla warfare.

361
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:08,500
The primary goal
for the defensive team

362
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:11,125
is to make sure
Doctor Yosano is protected.

363
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:12,666
As long as we
don't die outright,

364
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:15,666
her healing ability
can cure our injuries.

365
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:18,208
The offensive team
will split into two sections

366
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:21,333
and surprise the enemy using
Junichirou's mirage ability

367
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:24,250
and my nullification ability.

368
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:25,583
The crux of this strategy

369
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:28,250
is to keep our base
of operations hidden.

370
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:31,500
If our enemies hit us here
with everything they've got,

371
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:34,416
our defenses will never hold.

372
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:40,166
[CHUUYA] Boss, our
ambush ended in failure.

373
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:43,333
We put a tail on him
but I don't expect much.

374
00:21:43,416 --> 00:21:44,333
[OUGAI]
Very good.

375
00:21:44,416 --> 00:21:46,083
All according to plan.

376
00:21:46,166 --> 00:21:49,333
So then, the tracking solution,

377
00:21:49,416 --> 00:21:52,125
the one we put on
the assassins' clothes...?

378
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:54,333
The signal's coming
through loud and clear.

379
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:57,541
[OUGAI] Then I believe
we'll find their hideout...

380
00:21:58,166 --> 00:22:01,791
Of the three organizations,
only one of us can survive.

381
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:04,166
Our only option
left is to fight!

382
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:07,666
Naturally, we'll be the
only ones left standing.

383
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:10,791
I look forward to seeing
how this all turns out.

384
00:22:10,875 --> 00:22:12,375
A three-way war...!

385
00:22:12,458 --> 00:22:14,458
A war of the gifted!

386
00:23:47,583 --> 00:23:50,208
[OUGAI] My dear Elise,
if you want to draw,

387
00:23:50,291 --> 00:23:53,791
you shouldn't confine yourself
to that small piece of paper.

388
00:23:53,875 --> 00:23:55,875
Draw on the walls of this room!

389
00:23:55,958 --> 00:23:57,583
Like so many things in life,

390
00:23:57,666 --> 00:24:00,208
it's never fun to stay
within the lines.

391
00:24:00,291 --> 00:24:02,166
Oh, I have an idea!

392
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:05,250
Why don't we write
a letter to the enemy!

393
00:24:05,333 --> 00:24:07,958
Next time on <i>Bungo Stray Dogs,</i>

394
00:24:08,041 --> 00:24:12,541
episode 18:
"The Strategy of Conflict."

395
00:24:12,625 --> 00:24:13,916
I have to say,

396
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,041
surgical scalpels don't
exactly make the best darts.
