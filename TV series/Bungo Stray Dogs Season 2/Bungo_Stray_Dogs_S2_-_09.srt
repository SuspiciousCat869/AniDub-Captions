1
00:00:08,458 --> 00:00:12,041
[ATSUSHI] The head may err,
but never the blood.

2
00:00:31,208 --> 00:00:33,750
[YUKICHI sighs]

3
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:35,458
Hmm?

4
00:02:09,541 --> 00:02:13,083
[OSAMU] I really
don't feel like working.

5
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:14,916
Are you seriously gonna
mope around like this

6
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,291
the whole morning?

7
00:02:16,375 --> 00:02:18,958
Any other time I'd be up
for having this conversation

8
00:02:19,041 --> 00:02:20,708
with you, but not now please.

9
00:02:20,791 --> 00:02:22,583
[DOPPO] What happened
to the energetic young hero

10
00:02:22,666 --> 00:02:26,666
who just helped save this town
from the brink of destruction?

11
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,833
[OSAMU] The boss has me
lined up for this new job,

12
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:30,750
and I don't wanna.

13
00:02:30,833 --> 00:02:32,666
Is that the same
one Atsushi and the boss

14
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,791
were talking about yesterday?

15
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:36,375
Correct.

16
00:02:36,458 --> 00:02:37,916
Good morning, sir.

17
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,500
Dazai, what's the status of that
meeting with the Port Mafia?

18
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:43,875
[OSAMU]
I've made the arrangements.

19
00:02:43,958 --> 00:02:46,666
[YUKICHI] Do you think
their boss will come?

20
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,833
[OSAMU]
I'm positive.

21
00:02:48,916 --> 00:02:54,541
It's a perfect opportunity
for him to kill you, after all.

22
00:02:54,625 --> 00:02:58,916
I'd prefer that to having
bloodshed amongst our people.

23
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,875
Hey, Dazai...

24
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:03,583
What's this secret meeting
with the Port Mafia all about?!

25
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:05,916
Well, I have to admit
our little Atsushi's idea

26
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,583
has really snowballed.

27
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:09,458
Since the Guild is now
our biggest threat,

28
00:03:09,541 --> 00:03:10,333
we've decided to--

29
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:11,666
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait...

30
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,041
I'm totally lost here...

31
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:14,250
First of all!

32
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:17,833
Why are you the one
arranging this meeting?

33
00:03:17,916 --> 00:03:20,583
Because... I used to
be with the Port Mafia.

34
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:21,958
[DOPPO]
Huh?!

35
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:23,333
[OSAMU]
Oh, did I not tell you that?

36
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:25,708
My bad.

37
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:27,500
[DOPPO]
What?!

38
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,708
[CHUUYA] We've incurred
over a hundred casualties

39
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:32,958
in our organization alone.

40
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:37,375
I hate to admit it, but if Dazai
hadn't neutralized the curse,

41
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:40,083
that number would have
increased by ten fold.

42
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:42,166
I imagine my
predecessors would've been

43
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:44,083
rather upset with me.

44
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:50,666
[OUGAI]
Why are you here?

45
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:53,750
Dazai decided to kick me out
of the Armed Detective Agency,

46
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:57,458
saying he had no need
for such a useless prisoner.

47
00:03:57,541 --> 00:04:01,791
He was even having me run
errands in exchange for my stay.

48
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:04,000
This is from the
boss of the Agency.

49
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:06,500
It seems he'd like
to meet with you.

50
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:09,541
Oh?

51
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:11,666
So that's his play...

52
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,291
[OUGAI]
How are you feeling today, Boss?

53
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:19,291
[BOSS] Doctor, tell the
board this is an order:

54
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:23,125
Kill all enemy organizations,
military police,

55
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:27,166
anyone else who opposes
the Port Mafia by sundown.

56
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,250
[OUGAI]
That would be most unwise.

57
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:32,375
I don't care how many
of our own need to die.

58
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:33,583
Just kill them.

59
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:34,958
Just kill them all.

60
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:37,125
Kill them. Kill them.

61
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:38,916
[OUGAI]
I hear you loud and clear.

62
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:45,291
[OUGAI] The boss
has succumbed to illness.

63
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:48,833
He left behind a will,
entrusting me with his position.

64
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:53,666
You're the witness to that fact.

65
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,375
Understood?

66
00:05:08,916 --> 00:05:10,500
[OSAMU]
Welcome, "Boss."

67
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:12,333
[OUGAI]
It's been four years.

68
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:15,833
Do you happen to remember
the coat that I gave you Dazai?

69
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:17,333
[OSAMU]
Of course.

70
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,875
I had it burned.

71
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:27,333
[YUKICHI] Ougai Mori,
Boss of the Port Mafia...

72
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:32,375
[OUGAI] President of the
Agency, Yukichi Fukuzawa...

73
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:42,125
[YUKICHI]
So the time has finally come.

74
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:43,916
If the government
found out the leaders

75
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,125
of the most powerful
gifted organizations

76
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:48,416
were meeting like this,
I'm sure they would be

77
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,833
absolutely furious
to say the least.

78
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:52,750
I'll get straight
to business then.

79
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:55,250
A new member of the
Agency proposed an alliance

80
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:58,041
between our organizations.

81
00:05:58,125 --> 00:05:59,125
And?

82
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:01,166
I objected at first.

83
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,041
The idea of cooperating
with criminals

84
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:06,291
goes against
everything we stand for.

85
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:09,125
But the request came from
someone who has been shot,

86
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:13,416
kidnapped, slashed, and
beaten by the Port Mafia.

87
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,875
Thus his words carry weight.

88
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:20,916
I felt that I should investigate
his request, at the very least.

89
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,208
It would seem that we are both
in rather a difficult position.

90
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:26,958
[YUKICHI]
These are my thoughts.

91
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:28,416
At the very least,

92
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,125
I would like to propose a
temporary truce between us.

93
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:35,500
Heh. Have you ever read
the works of Schelling?

94
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:37,083
[YUKICHI]
Hmm?

95
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:39,791
Or are you more
familiar with Kissinger...

96
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:42,458
[OSAMU] Both are researchers
of strategic studies.

97
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:45,541
Taught by a certain
you-know-who.

98
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:47,500
[YUKICHI]
I do read Sun Tzu.

99
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:50,166
[OUGAI] There is a parallel
between state warfare

100
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:53,541
and the strategies of
organizations like ours.

101
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:57,041
No force shall reprimand us
if we violate an agreement.

102
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,541
What sanctions could be imposed

103
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:01,583
if the Port Mafia suddenly
broke a ceasefire?

104
00:07:01,666 --> 00:07:03,458
Or your people for that matter.

105
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:05,041
Only the party that decided

106
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:07,416
to uphold the
agreement would suffer.

107
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,958
As long as circumstances prevail
which incentivize betrayal,

108
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:13,833
a limited ceasefire
cannot be established.

109
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:18,125
The only option left...
is for complete cooperation.

110
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:19,875
That's also impossible.

111
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:21,416
[OUGAI]
Indeed.

112
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,250
The Port Mafia
is an organization

113
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:25,500
of pride and resentment.

114
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:26,916
Many of my people
have been dragged

115
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,583
through the grime and muck.

116
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:32,833
Many of mine have been brought
to the brink of death, as well.

117
00:07:32,916 --> 00:07:34,875
But they didn't die, did they?

118
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:38,125
That is a source of great
shame for the Port Mafia.

119
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:40,666
[YUKICHI] Then why
don't we have it out now?

120
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:46,291
Let's settle this and put
all of our grievances to rest.

121
00:07:55,416 --> 00:07:57,500
I thought you had
discarded your katana...

122
00:07:57,583 --> 00:08:00,916
You really haven't changed
at all, have you Fukuzawa?

123
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,833
And you still haven't
outgrown your obsession

124
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:05,791
with scalpels, Doctor Mori.

125
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:08,708
You still carry on
like a little girl.

126
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:13,125
This from the man who thinks
he can communicate with cats.

127
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:14,666
Huh?

128
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:27,666
A hologram ability, I see.

129
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,541
I enjoyed our encounter.

130
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:31,875
Let's continue it
on the battlefield.

131
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:35,000
[YUKICHI] The Agency
will be recovering Q tonight.

132
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:36,375
[OUGAI]
What of it?

133
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:38,875
[YUKICHI] I would advise you
not to get in our way.

134
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,958
For our sake, as well as yours.

135
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:42,041
Why's that?

136
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:43,875
We actually have
something in common,

137
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:46,500
something important to us.

138
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:49,708
We both have
a love for this city.

139
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:53,375
As people who live here
and work to keep it safe,

140
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:57,208
we cannot allow
outside forces to destroy it.

141
00:08:57,291 --> 00:08:58,833
[OUGAI]
The Guild is powerful.

142
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:01,083
You stand no chance
against them.

143
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:05,041
That's right, before I go,
my offer still stands

144
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:07,416
if you wish to come back
into the fold, Dazai.

145
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,750
Not a chance.

146
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:11,125
After all, you're the reason
why I was pushed out

147
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:13,750
of the Port Mafia
in the first place.

148
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:17,041
As I recall, you left
out of your own volition.

149
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:20,208
You were afraid of me,
weren't you?

150
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:23,083
Afraid that I would aspire
to take your position,

151
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:26,375
that one day I'd run a
knife across your throat.

152
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:30,500
Just like you did
to your predecessor.

153
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:36,666
They say that evil
expects evil from others.

154
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:39,750
I don't like the idea of
allying with you, either.

155
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:50,291
[OUGAI]
Our troops?

156
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:53,458
[RYUUROU] They've been
deployed as ordered.

157
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:56,125
You're aware I've
been with the Port Mafia

158
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:59,541
under you longer than
with the previous boss.

159
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:02,291
[OUGAI]
You are quite senior here.

160
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:04,458
[RYUUROU] The organization
was practically in ruins

161
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:06,666
toward the end of his tenure.

162
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,791
He was gravely ill,

163
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:12,541
and his orders were
erratic to say the least.

164
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:15,000
In what we thought
were its last throes,

165
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:16,625
the Port Mafia engaged

166
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:20,583
in one fruitless
conflict after another.

167
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:25,416
If not for you, he would have
eventually destroyed this city.

168
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:29,083
Is there a point
to all this babble?

169
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:31,250
[RYUUROU]
I simply wanted to state

170
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:36,166
that I believe Dazai fully
understands your intentions.

171
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:39,916
[OSAMU] So this is
where Q is being kept.

172
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:46,583
[STEINBECK]
Pleasant evening, isn't it?

173
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:49,875
Seems our strategist has hit
the nail on the head once again

174
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:51,791
in predicting your movements.

175
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:54,125
Figures it'd be a trap...

176
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:56,833
[OUGAI] Even in the event
that Dazai didn't intend

177
00:10:56,916 --> 00:11:00,000
to usurp my position, all of
my decisions in the moment

178
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:02,375
were calculated and optimized.

179
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:05,958
Therefore, I have no regrets.

180
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:09,000
But if Dazai had stayed
to be my right-hand man

181
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:12,416
against the Guild,
they'd have been no match.

182
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:16,750
They say that evil
expects evil from others.

183
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:18,500
[OUGAI]
Mr. Hirotsu,

184
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:21,333
fetch me the communicator
to the frontlines.

185
00:11:21,416 --> 00:11:23,625
I have it right here, sir.

186
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:25,916
[OUGAI] Despite what
I said to the Agency,

187
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,666
there is a rational path
toward a proper alliance.

188
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:33,500
Advance payment is
the essence of trust.

189
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:36,375
One party initially
incurs a loss up front,

190
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:40,208
with the prospect of gaining
a return hundreds of times over.

191
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:43,958
Only then will an
alliance quell bad blood.

192
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:57,333
Those two once defeated an enemy
gifted organization overnight.

193
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:58,500
Their alliance was considered

194
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:01,500
the most devastating
rivalry in history.

195
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:04,708
Tonight shall
mark their reunion.

196
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:07,416
[CHUUYA]
Let me set one thing straight.

197
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:12,375
Once I'm done taking out
the trash, you're next buddy.

198
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:14,416
Gimme a break, will ya?

199
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,375
I knew there was a reason
today was gonna suck.

200
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:18,916
The hell?

201
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,250
I never heard anything about
this in the strategic forecasts.

202
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:24,458
[OSAMU]
Sorry, I can't let you do that.

203
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:27,666
The cancelling ability...

204
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,166
This is such a drag.

205
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:32,166
[CHUUYA]
Hey, don't be stealin' my lines!

206
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:36,291
Now, let us take back our lead.

207
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:41,458
This retaliation will be our
common front against the Guild.

208
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:52,208
[OSAMU groans]

209
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:53,875
For cry'n out loud,

210
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:56,666
this is the worst day
I've had in years.

211
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:59,375
[CHUUYA]
Yo, Dazai, ever heard of Petrus?

212
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:02,125
[OSAMU]
The exorbitantly expensive wine?

213
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:04,708
[CHUUYA] The night you
vanished from the organization,

214
00:13:04,791 --> 00:13:08,291
I opened up an
'89 bottle in celebration.

215
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:10,833
That's how fed up
with you I was.

216
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:12,250
[OSAMU]
How sweet.

217
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,625
I remember setting a bomb
under your car that night.

218
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:16,708
[CHUUYA]
Wait, that was your doing?!

219
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:19,000
You make me sick.

220
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:21,750
Yeah, well you're no
ray of sunshine either.

221
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:24,708
Only thing I like about
you is your taste in shoes.

222
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:26,208
[CHUUYA]
Huh?

223
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:27,916
You do?

224
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,250
Yeah, as if.

225
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:30,166
Why you...!

226
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:31,750
[OSAMU]
Give it up.

227
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:34,875
I know your moves far too well
to be hit with a kick like that.

228
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:36,458
[CHUUYA]
I was going easy on you!

229
00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:38,541
If I were serious,
you would've been toast!

230
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:41,000
Oh, yeah...?

231
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:42,750
You're so scary.

232
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:47,250
[OSAMU]
There he is.

233
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:50,875
The sleeping beauty
awaiting his savior.

234
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:52,541
[CHUUYA] Wouldn't have
gone with "sleeping beauty"

235
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:54,000
but all right...

236
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,166
[OSAMU]
Gimme your knife.

237
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:56,750
Why?

238
00:13:56,833 --> 00:13:59,166
[OSAMU] Oh, wait, I swiped it
off you earlier, just in case.

239
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,041
[CHUUYA]
God I hate you!

240
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:05,833
[OSAMU]
Not gonna stop me?

241
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:08,541
[CHUUYA] My orders were
to take him back alive,

242
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:11,125
but seeing that kid's face
again gives me flashbacks

243
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:13,750
to all the body bags
my people came home in,

244
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:17,000
thanks to his curse.

245
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:19,041
Do what you want.

246
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:20,583
[OSAMU]
Very well.

247
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:22,958
I'll do just that.

248
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:26,125
[CHUUYA grunts]

249
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:28,208
You sure got soft.

250
00:14:28,291 --> 00:14:31,625
This angelic behavior
doesn't suit you one bit.

251
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:33,291
As long as Q is alive,

252
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:36,250
the Port Mafia still needs
my ability as a counter measure

253
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:37,666
against his curse.

254
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:40,625
Therefore it won't be in
their interest to kill me.

255
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:42,458
It's a strategic move.

256
00:14:42,541 --> 00:14:44,625
[CHUUYA]
I dunno if I buy that...

257
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,458
[CHUUYA]
Hey, Dazai...!

258
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:49,708
How about you gimme
that doll, you jerk?!

259
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:50,750
You wish!

260
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:52,750
This doll right here
is my insurance!

261
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:53,583
[CHUUYA]
Asshole...

262
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:55,666
I swear I'm gonna--

263
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:04,541
[LOVECRAFT] This shoulder
has been stiff as of late...

264
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:09,541
Perhaps I have been
working too hard.

265
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:12,083
What was that ability?

266
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:14,666
[OSAMU] I'd expect
no less from the Guild!

267
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,416
What amazing power!

268
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,208
[CHUUYA]
Get offa me!

269
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:21,166
[CHUUYA]
Hey Dazai, what's the plan?

270
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:22,625
Whaddya mean "what's the plan"?

271
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:24,208
With my gift,

272
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:27,083
all I have to do is touch them
with one itty-bitty finger and--

273
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:30,500
Dazai!

274
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:38,458
That punch... was strong...

275
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:40,916
[OSAMU grunts]

276
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,458
[CHUUYA]
Hey!

277
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:44,500
[OSAMU chuckles]

278
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:45,708
[CHUUYA]
You okay?

279
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:46,708
Yeah...

280
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:47,750
No, you're not...

281
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:49,625
What happened back there?

282
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:52,250
[OSAMU] Those tentacles
are very strange.

283
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:54,750
I can't disable them
with my ability.

284
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:56,000
[CHUUYA]
No way.

285
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:58,166
How can that be?

286
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:01,416
There are no exceptions
to my disabling ability.

287
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:05,000
Which leaves only
one possible answer.

288
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:07,041
It's not a gift at all.

289
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:08,625
[CHUUYA]
What?!

290
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:12,875
[CHUUYA] Come on, you've gotta
be joke'n with me now, right?

291
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:16,333
If it's not some kind of gift,
then just what is it?

292
00:16:16,416 --> 00:16:17,458
Who's to say?

293
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:19,375
We'll do things the
old fashioned way.

294
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:22,083
How about
Operation Shame and Toad?

295
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:23,166
Huh?

296
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:25,416
What is this,
Rain Beyond the Window?

297
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,583
I'm not so sure about that.

298
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:29,041
[OSAMU]
Come now.

299
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:32,500
Have my tactical decisions
ever led us astray before?

300
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:35,416
[CHUUYA]
Hmm... Ugh!

301
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,833
I'm so very hungry...

302
00:16:37,916 --> 00:16:40,166
[OSAMU]
Yo!

303
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:43,166
[LOVECRAFT]
After I dispatch this enemy,

304
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:45,000
I'm going home.

305
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:47,625
He was a decoy?

306
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:49,458
Interesting...

307
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:53,041
Gravity manipulation...

308
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:59,791
My special ability controls
the gravity of those I touch.

309
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:01,833
It's time for a nap, octopus.

310
00:17:01,916 --> 00:17:03,041
Nicely done!

311
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:04,458
[CHUUYA]
I can't believe you...

312
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:08,375
So sleepy...
I'd rather not move...

313
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:09,875
However...

314
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:13,958
I still have to fulfill my side
of the deal with Francis.

315
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:17,916
Dazai!

316
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:21,416
Huh?!

317
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:30,416
[CHUUYA] Oh come on, you gotta
be kidd'n me with this crap.

318
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,250
[OSAMU]
It's... something inhuman.

319
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:34,333
[CHUUYA]
Hmm?

320
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:36,875
Dazai, your arm...

321
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:40,833
Chuuya, there's something you
should know before I die...

322
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:42,000
What the hell, man!

323
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:43,500
You're not dying
in a place like--

324
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:44,958
Psyche!

325
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:46,541
I just love that old gag!

326
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:48,958
And it seemed like the
perfect time to use it!

327
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:51,291
How about concentrating
on how to kill that thing

328
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:53,583
instead of your
second rate magic tricks?

329
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:54,541
It's hopeless.

330
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:56,125
We should probably give up.

331
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:59,041
But maybe we have one
more course of action.

332
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:00,833
Hang on...

333
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:03,666
...is it what I'm thinking of?

334
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:06,000
We could show that
creature how we wiped out

335
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:08,583
an entire gifted
organization overnight

336
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:11,500
and received the title of
"devastating rivals."

337
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:16,208
Of course, if I don't get
to you in time, you might die.

338
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:18,375
I'll leave the decision to you.

339
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:22,041
Really, you're gonna
put the ball in my court...

340
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:25,041
I hate it when you
say stuff like that.

341
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:29,166
It always means that
I actually don't have a choice.

342
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:35,041
Grantors of dark disgrace...

343
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:41,000
[CHUUYA]
...you need not wake me again.

344
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:55,416
[STEINBECK] What am
I even looking at right now?

345
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,083
[OSAMU] Want me to
fill you in, worker bee?

346
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:04,083
That right there is the fully
realized form of Chuuya's gift.

347
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:08,291
[OSAMU]
His corrupted form allows him

348
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:10,833
to manipulate nearby gravitons,

349
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:15,625
creating a black hole which
swallows everything in its path.

350
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,708
The drawback is
he relinquishes control,

351
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:23,333
attacking in a blind rage
until he wastes away.

352
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:30,291
[OSAMU] Seriously though,
just what is that creature?

353
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:35,791
[OSAMU] No matter what he does,
it regenerates immediately.

354
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:37,458
Given that you're its partner,

355
00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:40,583
I imagine you must
know what it truly is.

356
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:41,833
I don't.

357
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:44,833
And even if I did know,
why would I tell you?

358
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:54,916
[OSAMU]
This is bad.

359
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,625
Chuuya's body won't
last much longer.

360
00:19:57,708 --> 00:19:59,166
[STEINBECK]
That's a shame.

361
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:01,333
Doesn't matter 'cause there's
no way to destroy Lovecraft

362
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:03,916
from the outside
when he's in that state.

363
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,541
[OSAMU]
The outside?

364
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:07,000
So does that mean
that he's vulnerable

365
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:09,791
if he's attacked
from the inside?

366
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:31,333
All right, Chuuya... finish him.

367
00:20:57,041 --> 00:21:05,500
[laughs]

368
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:09,458
You've annihilated the enemy.

369
00:21:09,541 --> 00:21:12,000
It's time to take a break.

370
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,833
[CHUUYA] I told you to stop
me as soon as it was over.

371
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:29,333
[OSAMU] I was going to, but it
was so entertaining to watch!

372
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:34,250
The reason I used Corruption
was because I trusted you.

373
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:37,750
You better listen
to me... If you don't...

374
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:40,666
...take me to the
extraction point...

375
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,791
...I'm gonna kill-- 

376
00:21:44,541 --> 00:21:46,000
Don't worry, buddy.

377
00:21:46,083 --> 00:21:47,625
I've got you.

378
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:49,333
I can't believe it.

379
00:21:49,416 --> 00:21:51,416
Lovecraft's really down.

380
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:56,416
Just who in the world
are you people anyway?

381
00:21:58,125 --> 00:22:00,333
The bad guys' enemy.

382
00:22:00,416 --> 00:22:01,875
That's all.

383
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:48,875
[RAMPO]
Yes!

384
00:23:48,958 --> 00:23:50,583
The Guild challenged me
to a detective game.

385
00:23:50,666 --> 00:23:52,666
Maybe it'll save me
from my boredom.

386
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:55,291
But who's this "Poe"
who sent me the challenge?

387
00:23:55,375 --> 00:23:56,458
Eh, whatever.

388
00:23:56,541 --> 00:23:58,458
If I win, he'll give me
secret documents

389
00:23:58,541 --> 00:24:00,208
on the Guild's flying fortress.

390
00:24:00,291 --> 00:24:02,791
[POE] That would be
incredible intel if you got it.

391
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:05,666
It would change the
outcome of this battle.

392
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:07,875
Next time on <i>Bungo Stray Dogs,</i>

393
00:24:07,958 --> 00:24:11,291
episode 22, part 1:
"Poe and Rampo";

394
00:24:11,375 --> 00:24:13,791
part 2: "Where the
Moby Dick Goes."

395
00:24:13,875 --> 00:24:17,041
[RAMPO] You think the boss
will praise me if I snag this?
