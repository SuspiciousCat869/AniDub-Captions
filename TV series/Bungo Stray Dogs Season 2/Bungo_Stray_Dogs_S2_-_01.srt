[door opens]

2
00:00:25,583 --> 00:00:26,458
[OSAMU]
Odasaku!

3
00:00:26,541 --> 00:00:28,125
What's up?

4
00:00:32,916 --> 00:00:34,875
Sorry to wake you, Sensei.

5
00:00:36,375 --> 00:00:37,458
Sensei?

6
00:00:37,541 --> 00:00:39,041
Why'd you call 'im that?

7
00:00:39,125 --> 00:00:40,958
[OSAMU]
Just look how wise he looks.

8
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:44,625
He even gives up his seat
when I have guests.

9
00:00:44,708 --> 00:00:46,666
So you're not gonna believe
what happened today.

10
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:49,500
There was a ridiculous
shootout inside a warehouse.

11
00:00:49,583 --> 00:00:51,083
[ODA]
Really...

12
00:00:51,166 --> 00:00:53,791
I wound up trading shots with
a very energetic group of guys!

13
00:00:53,875 --> 00:00:56,083
Their truck featured
a machine gun!

14
00:00:56,166 --> 00:00:59,750
[ODA] Sounds like
a rather hairy situation.

15
00:00:59,833 --> 00:01:02,833
So... those injuries of yours...

16
00:01:02,916 --> 00:01:05,833
I'm assuming you got
those from the hail of bullets.

17
00:01:05,916 --> 00:01:08,875
Actually, it was my own
fault because I had to pee

18
00:01:08,958 --> 00:01:12,166
and in my rush I tripped
right into a ditch.

19
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:13,791
That so...?

20
00:01:13,875 --> 00:01:16,250
I guess when you gotta go,
you gotta go...

21
00:01:16,333 --> 00:01:18,833
[OSAMU]
So true.

22
00:01:18,916 --> 00:01:20,666
[ODA]
This is Osamu Dazai...

23
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:24,458
An executive in the Port Mafia,
a criminal organization.

24
00:01:24,541 --> 00:01:26,708
[OSAMU] In the end, those
guys fell right into my trap

25
00:01:26,791 --> 00:01:29,583
and ran away crying, even though
I barely roughed them up.

26
00:01:29,666 --> 00:01:32,833
I really thought they'd be able
to take me out, but no dice.

27
00:01:32,916 --> 00:01:35,500
I was disappointed
to say the least.

28
00:01:35,583 --> 00:01:37,958
[ODA] We have a
saying in the Port Mafia

29
00:01:38,041 --> 00:01:41,125
"The biggest misfortune
for Dazai's enemies

30
00:01:41,208 --> 00:01:43,625
is that they are
Dazai's enemies."

31
00:01:43,708 --> 00:01:46,958
His body of work is written
in darkness and blood.

32
00:01:47,041 --> 00:01:50,166
Makes even the members
of the Port Mafia tremble.

33
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:53,833
He was practically
born to be one of them.

34
00:01:53,916 --> 00:01:55,041
[OSAMU]
Oh, man!

35
00:01:55,125 --> 00:01:57,000
Isn't there some
simple, reliable way

36
00:01:57,083 --> 00:01:59,333
for me to commit
suicide somewhere?

37
00:01:59,416 --> 00:02:00,208
[ODA]
Doubt it.

38
00:02:00,291 --> 00:02:01,083
[OSAMU]
Odasaku...

39
00:02:01,166 --> 00:02:02,333
[ODA]
Hmm?

40
00:02:02,416 --> 00:02:04,708
[OSAMU] Man fears death,
yet at the same time,

41
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:07,041
is also drawn to it.

42
00:02:07,125 --> 00:02:11,833
Death is endlessly consumed in
literature, in cities, in life.

43
00:02:11,916 --> 00:02:15,000
It is the singular event
that none may reverse.

44
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:20,750
That's what I pursue and desire.

45
00:02:21,916 --> 00:02:22,666
[OSAMU]
Barkeep!

46
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,291
One glass of bleach, please!

47
00:02:24,375 --> 00:02:25,666
We're all out.

48
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,666
Aw, that's a shame.

49
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,875
How 'bout a
bleach-based cocktail?

50
00:02:29,958 --> 00:02:31,041
We're all out.

51
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:33,416
[ODA]
Looks like you're outta luck.

52
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,333
[ANGO] You shouldn't let him
talk like that, Odasaku.

53
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:37,208
[ODA, OSAMU]
Hmm?

54
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:38,708
He might not go off the rails

55
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:41,458
if you called him out
every now and then.

56
00:02:41,541 --> 00:02:42,666
Ango!

57
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,583
Although a hammer
to the back of the head

58
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:46,416
might work better than words.

59
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,125
Oh, just a tomato juice.

60
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:49,416
I have to drive.

61
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,583
[OSAMU]
It's been a while.

62
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:52,250
How's work been?

63
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:54,666
Well, today was pretty rough.

64
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,875
Buying the necessary
smuggled items was tedious.

65
00:02:57,958 --> 00:03:02,041
After hours of negotiating, all
I got was this antique watch.

66
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:05,125
This rounds out about 74%
of transactions that have...

67
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:07,458
[ODA]
This is Sakaguchi Ango.

68
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:10,833
He's one of the Port Mafia's
intelligence officers.

69
00:03:10,916 --> 00:03:14,000
Just about all critical and
classified information passes

70
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:17,208
through Ango when
communicating with outsiders.

71
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:19,500
The secrets he carries
about the Port Mafia

72
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:21,708
are more valuable than gold.

73
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:23,166
There must be as
many people who'd love

74
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:26,416
to torture him as there
are stars in the sky.

75
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,833
It's not a job for the weak.

76
00:03:28,916 --> 00:03:31,958
[OSAMU] So, it sounds like
you fuzzed your job too then.

77
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:33,000
I "fuzzed"?

78
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:34,958
That's right,
we're fuzz buddies!

79
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:36,750
Come to think of it,
it's been a long time

80
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:39,625
since we first became
drinking buddies, Odasaku.

81
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:42,708
but I don't think I've ever
heard you complain about work.

82
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:45,166
As the lowest ranking
member of the organization,

83
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,708
I'm afraid my stories
would only bore you.

84
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:49,916
There you go being secretive...

85
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,916
Come on, tell us about your day.

86
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,625
Let's see, I punished a kid
for stealing from a store

87
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:57,708
in a shopping district that
pays us protection money.

88
00:03:57,791 --> 00:03:59,791
I resolved a fight between
the lover and the wife

89
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:02,166
of one of our shell
company executives.

90
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:06,291
And lastly, I disposed of a bomb
found behind one of our offices.

91
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:09,208
Wow! I wanna go out
and dispose of bombs too!

92
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:11,583
Do you think that the two
of us could switch jobs?!

93
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:13,125
You wouldn't be
able to handle it.

94
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:14,500
[ODA]
Yeah, you'd get blown up.

95
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:16,000
You serious?!

96
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:17,583
Hey, did you hear that, Ango?

97
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:18,458
He said blown up!

98
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:19,500
That I'd get blown up!

99
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:20,791
[ODA] As the
lowest ranking member

100
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:23,916
of the organization,
the jobs that come my way

101
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,666
are the ones no one
else wants to deal with.

102
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:30,000
You could say I'm basically
a glorified handyman.

103
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:33,083
Moving on, did the two
of you come here tonight

104
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:35,791
for some kind of official
business meeting?

105
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:38,416
[ODA]
Nah, it was merely coincidence.

106
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,291
[OSAMU]
But I did have a sneaky feeling

107
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:42,458
that I'd run into
both of you here.

108
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:45,916
Was there something you
needed from either of us?

109
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,166
[OSAMU]
Ah... no.

110
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:51,750
I just thought if
I showed up here tonight,

111
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:54,291
it might turn out
like the old days.

112
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:56,083
That's all really.

113
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,291
So then what are we toasting to?

114
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:01,708
[OSAMU]
Anything you like.

115
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:04,166
Who says we need a reason?

116
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:08,208
[ODA]
To the Stray Dogs.

117
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:16,833
[OSAMU, ANGO]
To the Stray Dogs.

118
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:20,875
[OSAMU]
Hey Ango, do you have a camera

119
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:22,833
in your bag by any chance?

120
00:05:22,916 --> 00:05:25,333
Yeah, I use it for work.

121
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:26,708
[OSAMU]
Why don't we take a photo?

122
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:28,166
To remember.

123
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:29,416
What do you mean?

124
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,791
Yeah, remember what?

125
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:34,166
That all three of us
were here together.

126
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,291
The three of us come here
to drink all the time.

127
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:37,291
[ANGO]
Heh.

128
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:40,333
Whatever you want,
Mr. Executive.

129
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:42,625
Make sure to get
my good side, 'kay?

130
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:45,458
I want you to capture
all my manly charms.

131
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:51,166
[ANGO]
I don't want my picture taken.

132
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,875
[ODA]
Uh...

133
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:56,250
[ODA] So, why do
you suddenly want a picture?

134
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:58,125
Call it a silly hunch
if you like,

135
00:05:58,208 --> 00:06:00,500
but I just have this feeling
that if we don't do it now,

136
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:02,125
we might never
have another chance

137
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:04,666
to prove we were
all together like this.

138
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:07,583
Hey Odasaku, say cheese.

139
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:08,875
[ODA]
Huh?

140
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:16,625
[ODA] As it turns out,
his hunch was correct.

141
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:19,166
That was the last time
that special friendship

142
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:23,500
between the three of us
was ever captured.

143
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:27,083
Because soon after that
photograph was taken

144
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:29,125
one of us would be dead.

145
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:34,916
[ODA]
Someone of my low status

146
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,916
would ordinarily never enter the
headquarters of the Port Mafia.

147
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,875
The reason for his
summoning me was unknown,

148
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:46,416
but his word within the
Port Mafia was absolute,

149
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,875
and so I beckoned to his call.

150
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:56,291
Name's Oda.

151
00:06:56,375 --> 00:07:00,166
I'm here on official business
at the request of the boss.

152
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,291
I'm Oda.

153
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:14,833
[ODA]
Boss, it's Oda.

154
00:07:14,916 --> 00:07:16,208
I'm coming in.

155
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:18,791
[OUGAI] Come on, Elise,
just wear the dress. Please!

156
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:19,916
Just for a bit!

157
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,041
A teensy-weensy little bit!

158
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:22,875
[ELISE]
No!

159
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:23,833
I don't wanna!

160
00:07:23,916 --> 00:07:25,083
[OUGAI]
Come on, my dear.

161
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:27,083
Just try it on, all right?

162
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:29,791
I put a lot of thought
into picking this out.

163
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:32,208
I mean just look at
these crimson frills!

164
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:34,250
Don't they look
like flower petals?

165
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:35,916
I'm sure you'll look great!

166
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,416
Look, it's not like
I hate pretty clothes.

167
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,125
But I do hate
you groveling, Rintaro!

168
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:43,208
[ODA]
Boss, you called for me?

169
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:45,291
How may I serve you?

170
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:46,708
[ELISE, OUGAI]
Hm?

171
00:07:57,458 --> 00:07:59,541
Now then, to begin...

172
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:00,958
Yes?

173
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:04,000
[OUGAI] Nothing you hear
leaves this room, understand?

174
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:06,250
Yes, I wasn't even here.

175
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:08,750
I appreciate you making
the time to meet with me,

176
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:12,416
despite your very pressing
issues with that young lady.

177
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,875
What matters did you
wish to discuss with me?

178
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:16,083
Well...

179
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:17,750
Uh.

180
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:18,708
[chuckles]

181
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:19,875
Never mind.

182
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:22,541
I called you here
for a singular reason.

183
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:24,666
I'd like you to find
someone for me.

184
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,208
Find someone?

185
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:28,875
You'd entrust someone like me
with such an important task?

186
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:30,958
I've heard good
things about you.

187
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:34,416
I personally wanted to ask
you to carry out this job.

188
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,541
The missing subject in question

189
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:40,333
is intelligence officer
Ango Sakaguchi.

190
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:43,916
Our sources say he was reported
to be missing as of last night.

191
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,333
It seems he never
even made it home.

192
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:48,666
Whether he vanished
of his own free will,

193
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,791
or if he was taken
away by brute force,

194
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:53,125
we still cannot
say for certain.

195
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:54,666
As you well know,

196
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:58,750
his position gave him access
to sensitive information.

197
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:01,000
Such knowledge could
be used to decimate us

198
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:03,833
if sold to rival organizations.

199
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:08,875
[OUGAI] However, taking that
element out of the equation,

200
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:11,666
Ango is still a
valuable employee.

201
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:15,000
If something has happened
to him, I wish to help.

202
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:16,875
Take this with you.

203
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:19,208
It's a Silver Oracle.

204
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:21,166
If you show this to anyone
in the organization,

205
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:26,166
including executives,
you will receive assistance.

206
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:27,583
Speaking of executives,

207
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:31,375
I understand you have a personal
relationship with Dazai.

208
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:35,000
It seems friendship
surpasses hierarchy.

209
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:37,708
His capabilities are astounding.

210
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,291
I'm sure in five years or so,

211
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:44,083
he'll have assassinated me and
taken the throne for himself.

212
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:50,708
One more thing...

213
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:52,291
[ODA]
Yes, Boss?

214
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:54,750
[OUGAI] I understand that for
as long as you've been with us,

215
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:58,416
you've never killed
anyone with that gun of yours...

216
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,791
Why is that?

217
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:01,250
[ODA]
Are you ordering me to reply

218
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:03,333
as the leader of
our organization?

219
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:04,416
[OUGAI]
Not at all.

220
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,333
It's just simple curiosity.

221
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:10,125
Well then,
I'd prefer not to answer.

222
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:14,500
[chuckles]
Very well.

223
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:16,541
You may go.

224
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:19,375
I hope that you will soon
bring me good news.

225
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:24,708
[RYUUROU] Ensure that the
city police do not hear of this.

226
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,958
Make a call to
the cleaners as well.

227
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:29,208
They'll move the bodies.

228
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:32,458
Investigate as to whether
these three men have families.

229
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:33,916
In the event that they do,

230
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,416
I'll personally make
contact with them.

231
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:39,791
I believe an executive will be
here to assist us shortly.

232
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:42,250
[OSAMU]
Good morning, everyone!

233
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:43,541
Hang on a second,

234
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:46,125
I'm almost through
this really difficult level.

235
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:48,041
Aw crap, he got ahead of me!

236
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:50,041
Well, how about some of this?

237
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:51,416
What?! He dodged it?!

238
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,500
Thank you for taking the
time to come out here, sir.

239
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:55,791
It appears our
armory guards were killed.

240
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:58,375
[OSAMU] It's been a while since
we had anyone reckless enough

241
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:00,375
to attack a Port Mafia depot.

242
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:04,208
Each of these men was hit with
ten to twenty rounds of gunfire.

243
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:07,416
A number of firearms were
then stolen from the armory.

244
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,750
[OSAMU]
I'll go take a look.

245
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:10,125
Take over for me, okay?

246
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:12,750
Wait, I...

247
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:14,416
I-I... Wait! I don't...

248
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,291
[OSAMU] The rounds went
clean through their bodies,

249
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:19,541
meaning they were
killed at close range.

250
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:21,708
The assailants
were skilled pros.

251
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:23,833
But I'm just getting
my hopes up.

252
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:26,000
Lemme see the
surveillance photos.

253
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:26,958
[RYUUROU]
You want some of this?

254
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:28,291
Oh, I'll give it to ya!

255
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:30,541
[OSAMU] They look like
hoodlums at first glance,

256
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:33,083
but they must be
well-trained soldiers.

257
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:36,875
The way they cover each other's
blind spots is proof enough.

258
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:38,541
But why appear to be otherwise?

259
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:39,708
[RYUUROU]
You little...

260
00:11:39,791 --> 00:11:41,958
Doh!

261
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:43,375
[OSAMU]
Mr. Hirotsu...

262
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:45,541
I have no excuse to offer.

263
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:48,375
Please give me a chance
to rectify this failure.

264
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:51,291
[OSAMU]
Do you recognize this gun?

265
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:53,250
[RYUUROU]
Hmm... It's an old model.

266
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:55,208
Even older than me.

267
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:57,708
But I believe that
would be a Graugeist.

268
00:11:57,791 --> 00:12:00,458
It's a traditional
European pistol.

269
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:04,458
[OSAMU] I actually saw this very
same type of gun last night...

270
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:08,708
[OSAMU]
...which seems to indicate

271
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:10,500
that they attacked me shortly

272
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:13,500
before the raid on the
armory was carried out.

273
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:18,041
[OSAMU] Then was it
all just a distraction?

274
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:21,041
[chuckles]
How very interesting.

275
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:22,583
They're a far more
ingenious bunch

276
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:25,250
than I had first
given them credit for.

277
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:27,750
Mr. Hirotsu, these men

278
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:31,416
hit one of the Port Mafia's
most secure storage units.

279
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,708
They gained entrance
with the official passcode

280
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:38,250
that is only known to members
of a sufficient clearance level.

281
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:41,500
[RYUUROU] Are you saying that
we have a traitor in our midst?

282
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:44,541
That we don't know
who's behind these attacks?

283
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:47,750
[OSAMU] My subordinates did
torture one of them yesterday.

284
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:51,291
But the man killed himself
before revealing very much.

285
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:55,250
He swallowed a cyanide pill
he'd tucked inside a molar.

286
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:58,250
But it wasn't a complete loss...

287
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:02,750
We learned the name of
their organization... "Mimic."

288
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:15,083
[ODA]
He was living in a hotel, huh...

289
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,958
[ODA]
Ango Sakaguchi...

290
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:41,125
Intelligence officer
of the Port Mafia...

291
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:44,500
A man both accomplished
and mysterious.

292
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:48,875
Truth is... none of us
know very much about you.

293
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:54,708
You fool.

294
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:02,041
[ODA]
A ventilation shaft...

295
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:31,958
Sniper, huh?

296
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:36,583
[phone ringing]

297
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,250
[ODA]
Dazai!

298
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:40,333
[OSAMU]
What a surprise.

299
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:42,250
You so rarely call me.

300
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:44,875
[ODA] A sniper
fired at me in Ango's room.

301
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:46,208
I'm going after him.

302
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:47,583
He's at the building
across the street

303
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:49,541
from the secondhand bookstore.

304
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:52,208
[OSAMU] You want me
to cut off his escape route?

305
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:53,791
[ODA]
Yes.

306
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:55,791
I have the Silver Oracle with
me, so if you need me to, I'll--

307
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:58,041
[OSAMU]
There's no need.

308
00:14:58,125 --> 00:15:00,083
Don't push yourself too hard.

309
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:01,958
Wait for me to get there.

310
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:11,083
[ODA]
Don't move!

311
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:14,916
[ODA]
This some kind of trap?

312
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,125
They must be after this safe.

313
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:23,250
Odasaku, duck!

314
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:38,541
[OSAMU] You are always such
a troublemaker, Odasaku.

315
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:41,208
I know you could've
easily and quickly killed

316
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:45,458
every one of these gunmen
if you had wanted to.

317
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:47,750
[ODA]
My ability... Flawless,

318
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:51,666
allows me to see up to
six seconds into the future.

319
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:56,958
You killed all of them?

320
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:58,625
[OSAMU] They wouldn't
have given us information

321
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:00,666
if we took them alive.

322
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,250
They already proved
they love the taste

323
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:05,625
of their poison pills
too much for that.

324
00:16:05,708 --> 00:16:07,291
I know...

325
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:11,250
It wasn't the methodology
that you were concerned with.

326
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:14,666
Listen to me, these men
were combat professionals.

327
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:18,000
Even you wouldn't have been
able to avoid killing them.

328
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:19,208
True.

329
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:21,791
If you hadn't have shown up,
I'd be dead now.

330
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:23,833
[OSAMU]
Listen, Sakunosuke...

331
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:27,166
I understand that you have
a creed against killing anyone,

332
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,875
no matter the circumstance.

333
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:32,458
But it's that creed
that's holding you back.

334
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:36,041
It's why the Port Mafia is only
using you as an errand boy.

335
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:38,416
You have so much more potential.

336
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,916
Thanks for your concern,

337
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,500
but I've heard this lecture
more times than I can count.

338
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:44,750
Onto more important matters...

339
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:47,166
Just who were these guys anyway?

340
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:49,666
You see that gun
holstered on his waist?

341
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:52,333
It's a very old style
firearm from Europe...

342
00:16:52,416 --> 00:16:54,375
It's called a Graugeist.

343
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:56,708
They're using vintage pistols.

344
00:16:56,791 --> 00:16:59,125
They have a low accuracy
and firing rates.

345
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:00,375
Not exactly something

346
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:03,291
that would be well suited
for modern combat.

347
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:06,333
Most likely, its sole purpose
was to deliver warning shots

348
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:09,125
in a narrow alley like this.

349
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:12,333
That pistol most likely serves
as their personal emblem.

350
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:14,541
You haven't
answered my question.

351
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:15,791
They're called "Mimic."

352
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:16,958
Never heard of 'em.

353
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:19,625
I'm still investigating
the specifics.

354
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:22,750
Perhaps the fact that they had a
sniper staking out Ango's room

355
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:25,666
will give us a clue as
to their intentions.

356
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:28,125
I'm pretty sure that
they were after this safe.

357
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:29,458
That so?

358
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:31,458
[ODA]
It was hidden in Ango's room.

359
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:33,208
I wasn't able to
find a key, though.

360
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:36,250
Well then... I think I can help.

361
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:40,750
Let's take a look-see.

362
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:42,125
Allow me.

363
00:17:42,791 --> 00:17:44,333
Huh.

364
00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:45,500
[click]

365
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:46,916
And voila!

366
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,125
[ODA] He's sure
clever with his hands...

367
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:51,458
[gasps]

368
00:17:51,541 --> 00:17:53,125
No...

369
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:54,791
It can't be...

370
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:57,250
If what you said
earlier is true

371
00:17:57,333 --> 00:18:00,291
and this gun is some
kind of emblem of theirs,

372
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:03,041
does this mean Ango
was one of them all along?

373
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:05,208
We shouldn't jump
to conclusions.

374
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:07,333
He may have taken this
gun off of one of them

375
00:18:07,416 --> 00:18:10,333
during an altercation,
or it's possible that

376
00:18:10,416 --> 00:18:15,125
they planted it in his room with
the purposes of implicating him.

377
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:16,625
[sighs]

378
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:18,625
Yeah, I guess you're
right about that.

379
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:20,416
[OSAMU]
I will say...

380
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,333
I did notice something
odd yesterday.

381
00:18:23,416 --> 00:18:25,625
When the three of us
were drinking at the bar,

382
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:28,583
Ango said he had just
come back from a deal.

383
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:30,791
I think that was a lie.

384
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:31,916
How so?

385
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,208
Did you see the
inside of his bag?

386
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:37,750
It had cigarettes,
a folding umbrella, a camera,

387
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:40,333
and his prize,
the antique watch.

388
00:18:40,416 --> 00:18:44,625
The umbrella was wrapped in
cloth and had clearly been used.

389
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:47,708
He'd gone for business to Tokyo,
where it had been storming.

390
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:50,583
So his umbrella was wet
because it was raining.

391
00:18:50,666 --> 00:18:52,208
What's odd about that?

392
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:54,375
What's odd is that
he supposedly commuted

393
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:56,416
to his appointment in his car.

394
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:59,625
So when did he have a
chance to use his umbrella?

395
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:01,291
It wasn't before the deal,

396
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:04,500
because the umbrella was
on top of the antique watch.

397
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:06,375
And it wasn't afterward.

398
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:07,458
Why's that?

399
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:09,125
Going off the
condition of the cloth,

400
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:11,750
the umbrella was
more than lightly used.

401
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:13,333
It had to have been
soaking in the rain

402
00:19:13,416 --> 00:19:15,666
for a good half hour or so.

403
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:18,000
But for being in
the rain for so long,

404
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:21,625
neither his shoes nor his pants
showed any evidence of it.

405
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:25,000
If his deal was at eight,
and we met at the bar at ten,

406
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:26,708
two hours wouldn't
have been long enough

407
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:29,083
for his shoes and pants to dry.

408
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:31,416
Maybe he changed
his clothes before coming.

409
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:35,166
If so, I would've seen some kind
of evidence of that in his car.

410
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:37,583
He happened to drive
me home that night.

411
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:39,750
I don't think
Ango made a deal.

412
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:42,666
I think he went to
meet someone in the rain.

413
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:45,083
He talked to them
for about 30 minutes,

414
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:48,416
and then killed some time
before heading over to the bar.

415
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,166
Intelligence officers like
Ango will sometimes choose

416
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:54,791
a rainy road on which to conduct
their classified meetings.

417
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:57,375
It's more secure
than an indoor space.

418
00:19:57,458 --> 00:20:01,041
He's the Port Mafia's
classified intelligence officer,

419
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:02,583
of course he'd have
one or two meetings

420
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:04,291
he couldn't tell anyone about!

421
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:08,375
If it was business as usual,
why not say so?

422
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:10,375
If he'd told us he
couldn't talk about it,

423
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:12,666
we wouldn't have
pressed any further.

424
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,708
Isn't that right?

425
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:17,625
[ODA]
He has a point.

426
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:20,333
[OSAMU] But instead,
he made up an alibi.

427
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:23,625
Why would he go to such
lengths to hide a meeting?

428
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:32,208
Would ya look at that...

429
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:34,333
You sure don't go down easily.

430
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:37,750
To be perfectly honest, I'm
really impressed by all of you.

431
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:40,166
No other organization
has had the gumption

432
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:42,750
to go head-to-head
with the Port Mafia.

433
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:45,125
Dazai! Stop!

434
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:52,875
[OSAMU] Can you see the
glimmer of pure joy in my eyes?

435
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:55,958
With just the slight squeeze
of your finger on that trigger,

436
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:59,875
you can deliver to me what
it is my heart most desires.

437
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:03,583
My only fear is the possibility
that you'll miss your target.

438
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:04,791
But you won't.

439
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:07,458
Because you're
a sniper, aren't you?

440
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:09,125
Dazai!

441
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:10,958
Either way,
you won't make it out alive.

442
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:14,458
You might at least try to kill
one of the enemy executives.

443
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:15,750
What do you think you're doing?

444
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:20,083
Come now, take me
with you to the afterlife.

445

Please, won't you wake me from
this oxidizing world of a dream?

00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:24,916

[gunshot]

448
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,875
[OSAMU]
Sorry if I worried you.

449
00:21:39,958 --> 00:21:42,166
Was quite the
performance, wasn't it?

450
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:43,541
Performance...

451
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:46,833
[OSAMU]
I knew that he'd miss.

452
00:21:46,916 --> 00:21:49,708
His left cheek had the imprint
from his sniper rifle,

453
00:21:49,791 --> 00:21:52,166
meaning he was left-handed.

454
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:54,750
He was using his
non-dominant hand,

455
00:21:54,833 --> 00:21:57,791
and he was so unsteady
that he could barely walk.

456
00:21:57,875 --> 00:22:00,166
And with the type of
pistol he was using,

457
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:04,833
he would've had to press it
right up against my forehead.

458
00:22:04,916 --> 00:22:07,916
I knew you'd take action if
I distracted him long enough

459
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,083
and whittled down his
stamina until he couldn't--

460
00:22:10,166 --> 00:22:11,541
Just shut up, Dazai.

461
00:22:11,625 --> 00:22:13,541
I've heard enough.

Please find Ango.

[ODA]
Yeah, I get it.

465
00:23:48,125 --> 00:23:51,666
[ANGO] The Graugiest you
found has a special engraving.

466
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:53,666
It proves, without a doubt...

467
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:57,875
...that the owner belongs
to the Mimic organization.

468
00:23:57,958 --> 00:24:01,458
It took me a year to get
my hands on that pistol.

469
00:24:01,541 --> 00:24:04,500
[ODA]
Ango... are you actually...

If we could,
