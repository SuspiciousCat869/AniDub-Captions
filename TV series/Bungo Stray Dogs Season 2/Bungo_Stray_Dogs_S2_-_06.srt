1
00:00:08,541 --> 00:00:13,041
[OUGAI]
Hmm... One strike...

2
00:00:13,125 --> 00:00:15,708
One should be able to hit
their enemy's vital point

3
00:00:15,791 --> 00:00:20,750
in one, single... strike!

4
00:00:20,833 --> 00:00:22,583
You suck at that.

5
00:00:22,666 --> 00:00:25,166
[OUGAI]
Now then...

6
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:28,541
[ELISE]
Hm? What are you up to now?

7
00:00:28,625 --> 00:00:31,291
I'm writing a little
letter to a friend.

8
00:02:01,916 --> 00:02:03,666
[MITCHELL] I want you
to load all of that cargo

9
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,458
into hatch number three!

10
00:02:05,541 --> 00:02:08,875
You will be billed for
anything you damage!

11
00:02:08,958 --> 00:02:10,375
For goodness sake,

12
00:02:10,458 --> 00:02:13,666
how did I end up becoming
responsible for all this?

13
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:14,833
Hmm?

14
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:25,750
Would you stop?

15
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:26,958
[MITCHELL]
Huh?

16
00:02:27,041 --> 00:02:28,125
[HAWTHORNE]
I can't hear the voice of God

17
00:02:28,208 --> 00:02:30,083
with you staring like that.

18
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:31,458
[MITCHELL]
Oh, is that so?

19
00:02:31,541 --> 00:02:33,708
What a pious minister you are.

20
00:02:33,791 --> 00:02:37,375
Then I'm sure you
must love this verse:

21
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:40,541
"and to dust
you shall return."

22
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:48,291
That's from Genesis,

23
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:50,875
chapter three, verse 19.

24
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:53,000
While the others are
scattered across the land,

25
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:56,541
it is our duty to see that
this ship is protected.

26
00:02:56,625 --> 00:02:58,833
Have you forgotten that?

27
00:02:58,916 --> 00:03:01,041
Not even in the slightest.

28
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:02,625
Perhaps you've forgotten,

29
00:03:02,708 --> 00:03:06,416
it is my sacred mission to see
judgment is dealt to the wicked.

30
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,375
I welcome the enemy
to come at me.

31
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:10,833
They will atone for their sins

32
00:03:10,916 --> 00:03:13,958
even if it's at the
cost of their lives.

33
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:17,958
Tell me now, do you
wish for atonement as well?

34
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:19,416
Don't be ridiculous.

35
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,500
You aren't even worthy
of polishing my shoes.

36
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:26,291
[GUY A]
Uhhh... Ex... cuse me...

37
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:29,750
This letter was found
among the cargo.

38
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:31,500
[HAWTHORNE]
A letter?

39
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:36,666
To the Guild...

40
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,291
[OUGAI] Dear Sir and Madam,

41
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:42,750
I hope that this letter finds
you in the best of health.

42
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:45,041
At the risk of sounding
presumptuous,

43
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:47,833
I wish to inform
you of the Guild assets

44
00:03:47,916 --> 00:03:51,458
we will obliterate next
in our military conflict.

45
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:53,708
"The full list of these
aforementioned assets

46
00:03:53,791 --> 00:03:55,333
are as follows:

47
00:03:57,916 --> 00:04:02,000
[HAWTHORNE] First,
your luxury liner, the <i>Zelda.</i>

48
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:05,541
Second, the life of one
Nathaniel Hawthorne.

49
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:08,916
And third, the life of
one Margaret Mitchell."

50
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,166
Huh??

51
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,750
"Sincerely, Boss of the
Port Mafia, Ougai Mori."

52
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:16,458
He plans to obliterate
us and the ship?

53
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:19,291
I think not.

54
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:22,291
[HAWTHORNE] We'll depart
once all cargo is on board!

55
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:23,458
Any update?

56
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:25,541
Uh... About two more hours.

57
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:26,791
[HAWTHORNE]
Make it half an hour.

58
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:28,333
[GUY A]
Wha... Half an hour?!

59
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:29,833
[HAWTHORNE] Have the
freight helicopter unload

60
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:33,500
on the deck helipad while
the other loading is underway.

61
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:36,291
And strengthen security
around the ship.

62
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:37,875
What are you doing?!

63
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:41,458
That letter is nothing more
than a silly prank to scare us!

64
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:43,166
You sure of that?

65
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:46,416
Since our Guild has no physical
representation on land,

66
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,583
this ship is essentially
our headquarters.

67
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:50,083
[MITCHELL]
So what?

68
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:52,291
[HAWTHORNE] The times when
we are replenishing supplies is

69
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,333
when we're most vulnerable.

70
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:57,500
Our enemy is a
supernatural organization.

71
00:04:57,583 --> 00:04:59,625
While they may not be
a threat to our lives,

72
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:03,208
they could sink this ship if
they launched a surprise attack.

73
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:04,250
[GUY B]
Mr. Hawthorne, sir.

74
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:05,333
[MITCHELL]
Hm?

75
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:07,041
[HAWTHORNE]
Hmm?

76
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:08,791
[GUY B] There's something
you should see.

77
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:14,583
[GUY B]
We found him on the pier.

78
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:17,833
He tried to escape,
but we restrained him.

79
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:20,458
[GUY C]
He was carrying this.

80
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:23,125
Looks like just some
ordinary thug to me.

81
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:26,875
I recognize your face
from a report I once read

82
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:29,000
"the Port Mafia Bomber."

83
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:31,291
Ohhh, is that who I am now?

84
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:33,041
Where is this place anyway?!

85
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:35,875
I understand the Armed Detective
Agency recently stopped you

86
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:37,333
from bombing a train.

87
00:05:37,416 --> 00:05:38,583
That was an experiment!

88
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:41,250
Even failures provide
useful information!

89
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:43,541
Would you like me to
make a mummy out of him?

90
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:47,416
[HAWTHORNE] No... I have a
good idea of the enemy's hand.

91
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:51,291
He was no doubt sent here
in order to plant a bomb.

92
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:54,291
How terribly crude of them.

93
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:57,750
His blood...

94
00:05:57,833 --> 00:06:00,208
[HAWTHORNE] The Scarlet Letter
is the Word of God...

95
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:02,375
It penalizes the immoral

96
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:04,875
and brands a mark on
them that never fades.

97
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:06,666
All right, you win! I surrender!

98
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,041
I'll tell you everything!

99
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:09,708
The truth is, I'm an
ambassador representing

100
00:06:09,791 --> 00:06:11,166
the Commander-in-Chief
of the Universe!

101
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:12,750
Who does he think he's fooling?

102
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:14,000
Sheesh...

103
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:16,708
[MOTOJIROU screams]

104
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:19,500
My words did not reach you.

105
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:23,541
You refuse to repent
and atone for your sins.

106
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:27,000
These lemon-shaped
bombs are your ability?

107
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:29,250
How very foolish.

108
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:32,208
Even a common man
could make explosives.

109
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:34,208
Yet you thought your
ability would be enough

110
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:37,000
to sink this ship?

111
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:41,083
You've clearly
underestimated us.

112
00:06:44,958 --> 00:06:48,208
May God's grace be with you.

113
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:50,500
[GUY D] Moving in
to unload the supplies.

114
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:55,083
[MOTOJIROU]
God, huh...?

115
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:57,458
You talk a lot about Him.

116
00:06:57,541 --> 00:07:01,208
Are you saying you can
hear the voice of God?

117
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:04,500
The only language that allows us
to understand the Universe

118
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:07,458
that God's created is science!

119
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:09,291
He survived that explosion?

120
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:10,875
[MOTOJIROU]
I understand it's the nature

121
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:14,541
of you religious types
to have unshakable faith,

122
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:18,416
but the foundation of science
is to question everything.

123
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,791
You should have questioned
my bomb-making ability

124
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:23,291
just a little more thoroughly.

125
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:27,708
It's true that I made these
explosives on my own time.

126
00:07:27,791 --> 00:07:30,583
But my true gift is the ability
to receive absolutely

127
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:33,166
<i>no</i> damage from
lemon-shaped explosives!

128
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:36,041
That beautiful spindle shape is
the ultimate form of geometry,

129
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:38,625
fit to bring an end
to this wretched world!

130
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,416
And on that note,
here's a present from

131
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,875
the Commander-in-Chief
of the Universe and myself...

132
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:48,083
It can't be...

133
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:52,000
Abandon the ship immediately!

134
00:07:57,333 --> 00:08:03,875
[laughs]

135
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:12,041
Our ship...

136
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:13,750
Just who was that man?!

137
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:16,541
[HAWTHORNE] It appears that
letter was no mere prank.

138
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:18,833
[MITCHELL]
Hmph!

139
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:20,333
With the <i>Zelda</i>
out of commission,

140
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:23,458
two of their targets remain.

141
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:25,625
The enemy will be
upon us shortly.

142
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:27,958
We shall engage them here.

143
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:29,458
If we halt their ambush,

144
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:32,375
the number of gifted
opponents is immaterial...

145
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:34,708
They'll be no match for us.

146
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:38,166
[OUGAI] ...is what I imagine
our enemy will say.

147
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:41,958
The Guild's gifted members
are indeed formidable.

148
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:43,375
Even our elite members

149
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:47,250
would have a hard time
taking them out,

150
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:49,875
which is precisely why...

151
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:55,416
...I've decided to move my most
eager, and motivated piece...

152
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,458
...into play.

153
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:08,000
[AKUTAGAWA coughs]
This sea breeze is suffocating.

154
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:25,208
Let's get this over
with, shall we?

155
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:27,708
You must be the
Port Mafia's assassin.

156
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:28,958
[AKUTAGAWA]
How are you feeling...

157
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:30,750
...irmao of the Guild?

158
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:32,208
[HAWTHORNE]
Terrible.

159
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:36,125
It's like I've had a run-in
with Satan himself.

160
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:39,166
May I ask you your name?

161
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,916
Call me Diablo.

162
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,625
[HAWTHORNE] Hmph.
Then this must be Mount Hermon.

163
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:46,000
Are you a trial sent to test

164
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:48,500
this humble servant's
faith in God?

165
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:50,583
[AKUTAGAWA]
Is it a trial you want, irmao?

166
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:53,250
Well then, let me give you one!

167
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:59,000
[HAWTHORNE]
Do not call me "irmao."

168
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:02,875
I am a minister,
not some relic of ancient Rome!

169
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:06,125
Don't believe that will be
enough to test my faith,

170
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:07,875
you demon!

171
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:12,833
Repent for your transgressions,
little man of the Port Mafia!

172
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:14,416
Amusing.

173
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:21,875
[HAWTHORNE] Is his ability
mid-range matter manipulation,

174
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:24,833
both offensive and defensive?

175
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:27,583
It's very similar to my own.

176
00:10:27,666 --> 00:10:29,541
In that case...

177
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:34,166
[BOTH] The one whose ability
holds the most promise will win!

178
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:36,458
[AKUTAGAWA]
Rashoumon!

179
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:39,625
[HAWTHORNE]
The Scarlet Letter!

180
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:47,333
Is that the best
you can do, irmao?

181
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:52,333
I was mistaken about you...

182
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:54,000
You are no devil at all.

183
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:56,500
What the...?

184
00:10:56,583 --> 00:11:00,166
This blood is
turning into writing...

185
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:02,583
You are nothing more
than a soulless creature

186
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:05,125
that lusts after the
flesh of the feeble.

187
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:07,666
I have no doubt that until now,
you've only fought

188
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:12,666
gifted enemies far
weaker than yourself.

189
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:13,750
Huh?

190
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:16,291
[MITCHELL]
The Port Mafia is nothing.

191
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:19,875
I will take back
my family's honor!

192
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:24,916
[AKUTAGAWA]
My coat's disintegrating...

193
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,416
A weathering ability?

194
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,750
I refuse to lose to someone
who has never known

195
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:32,083
the feeling of defeat,
that crushing humiliation!

196
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:34,333
I will not allow it!

197
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:41,625
[AKUTAGAWA] You think
I have never known defeat?

198
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:46,041
[HAWTHORNE]
Huh?

199
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:48,041
Margaret!

200
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:52,791
[AKUTAGAWA] Defeat and
humiliation are always with me.

201
00:11:57,541 --> 00:12:01,291
[AKUTAGAWA] I am a remnant,
passing through the darkness.

202
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:04,833
Therefore, such despair
will not be the end of me.

203
00:12:04,916 --> 00:12:06,791
Not even close!

204
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:19,833
Why is this happening now?

205
00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:23,208
[HAWTHORNE] That's not
a wound caused by my ability.

206
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:26,750
Was he injured before
he even came here?

207
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:28,375
[AKUTAGAWA]
This is nothing!

208
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:30,916
Fight me with
everything you've got.

209
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,250
If you don't, then there was
no point in coming here.

210
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:36,416
Come at me!

211
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,833
[HAWTHORNE] Why would
you go to such lengths?

212
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:41,750
[AKUTAGAWA] My only wish
is to hear one word...

213
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:46,083
...a simple, trivial word,
said by one man.

214
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:48,333
In order to have
that wish realized,

215
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:51,291
I have experienced
far more agonizing defeats

216
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:54,208
than you could
possibly understand!

217
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:55,666
[HAWTHORNE]
This man is a ruthless killer

218
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:59,416
from the Port Mafia,
and yet deep down,

219
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:02,875
he pines for something
to soothe his soul.

220
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:05,916
Something that he
would even give his life for.

221
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,208
Such passion might
even rival the power of faith.

222
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:14,708
[HAWTHORNE] You asked me to
fight with everything I've got.

223
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,750
I've made my decision;

224
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:21,166
I will see to it that
your wish is granted.

225
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:27,000
What?!

226
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:56,625
Rashoumon...

227
00:13:56,708 --> 00:13:59,291
Jaws of Endless Gates!

228
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:15,416
[HAWTHORNE]
Margaret...

229
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:33,041
People need to hear
that they're worthwhile

230
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:34,916
and somebody
cares they're alive!

231
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,333
That's human decency!

232
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:38,833
What don't you get about that?!

233
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,333
[AKUTAGAWA] I don't
need you to tell me that.

234
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:46,250
I already know...

235
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:50,041
[RAMPO]
Man, I'm so bored!

236
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:51,833
I wanna go outside!

237
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:54,250
Any suspicion activity?

238
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:57,333
A bunch of nothing
followed by more nothing.

239
00:14:57,416 --> 00:15:00,333
Luckily, the only way
to enter this hall

240
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:03,541
is through that
underground railroad tunnel.

241
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:07,000
Even if an enemy does try
to invade our location,

242
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:10,500
our security cameras
will warn us well in advance.

243
00:15:10,583 --> 00:15:13,416
We set a fair amount of
traps along the way as well.

244
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:16,083
[RAMPO sighs]
War is so boring.

245
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:17,416
Huh?

246
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:21,416
I'm already out of snacks
after just half a day.

247
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,333
I know!

248
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:23,583
Hey, Akiko!

249
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:25,208
Let's play Hanafuda online!

250
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:27,750
Okay! How much
do you wanna bet?!

251
00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:29,333
Hmm?

252
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:32,958
[OUGAI] Attacking enemy bases
makes my heart dance with joy.

253
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:34,500
Time for our next move.

254
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:37,041
How go the preparations?

255
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:38,250
[GUY E]
Everything is ready.

256
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:39,875
You have more
than enough force

257
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:43,333
to make the Agency dance
to our savage tune.

258
00:15:43,416 --> 00:15:46,458
I look forward to hearing
a superb melody.

259
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:47,958
What's the matter?

260
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:50,666
[RAMPO] I think we should call
back the defensive teams.

261
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:51,541
[AKIKO, KENJI]
Hmm?

262
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:53,208
An attack...

263
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:57,166
In your estimation,
how many are there?

264
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:00,750
[RAMPO]
One...

265
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,958
[KIRAKO]
Aww... My little baby...

266
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:13,541
As soon as this
whole mess is over,

267
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:17,750
I'll come back for you, okay? 

268
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:18,791
Ah! Naomi!

269
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:20,333
How long've you
been there?! I've--

270
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:21,125
What're you doing?

271
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:22,791
I-I-I was working! Really!

272
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:24,458
I wouldn't be slacking
off on the company!

273
00:16:24,541 --> 00:16:27,291
Not me! No way! See, work!

274
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:30,000
Haha. Do do root do roo.
Click click tab!

275
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:31,500
What?

276
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:35,083
"An explosion occurred on
a cruise liner in Yokohama"...

277
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:38,166
That wouldn't happen to be
the Guild's ship, would it?

278
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:40,416
What caused the explosion?

279
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,958
I'd make a bet it was that
one guy who loves explosions.

280
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:47,291
I wonder if he'll come
after the Agency next.

281
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:49,541
[NAOMI]
I hope my brother is safe...

282
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,500
[KIRAKO]
It'll be all right, Naomi...

283
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:55,833
Huh?

284
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:58,541
Yeah, well at least
we know your cat is A-Okay!

285
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:00,500
[KIRAKO]
Please forget about that.

286
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:05,708
Cameras 3, 4, and 8 have
stopped working

287
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,583
Activate the turrets.

288
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:14,958
Huh?

289
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,583
You must be more
short staffed than I thought

290
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:25,625
to let these machines
handle someone like me.

291
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:28,083
Gimme a real challenge.

292
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:29,333
What should we do?

293
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:34,958
I believe we're
of the same opinion.

294
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,208
[CHUUYA]
Oh, come on...

295
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:43,458
Only two of you?

296
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:45,250
If you don't care
for your reception,

297
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:47,250
perhaps you should've
made an appointment.

298
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:49,208
You think the Mafia
needs an appointment

299
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:51,708
to raise hell on
enemy territory?

300
00:17:51,791 --> 00:17:53,708
Oh! I'm pretty sure they don't!

301
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:56,875
[AKIKO] If that's why
you're here, then have at it.

302
00:17:56,958 --> 00:17:59,916
But that's not the real
reason you've come around,

303
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,708
is it, now?

304
00:18:00,791 --> 00:18:01,500
[CHUUYA]
Hm?

305
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:03,000
How did you know that?

306
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:06,166
[AKIKO] We'd be a sorry excuse
for a detective agency if

307
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:10,125
we couldn't discern a client's
intentions right off the bat.

308
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:11,708
[CHUUYA]
Where's your president?

309
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:13,458
[AKIKO]
Right over there.

310
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:18,625
My boss has
a special gift for you.

311
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,250
[YUKICHI]
Those men...

312
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:23,000
Are they members of the Guild?

313
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:26,208
[CHUUYA] That's right,
we reeled them in with bait.

314
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:28,833
Here's the time and
location they'll appear.

315
00:18:28,916 --> 00:18:31,916
You don't get many
chances like this, do you?

316
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,708
You can finally get one
over on that lousy Guild!

317
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:39,625
[YUKICHI] The opportunity
to ambush them

318
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:42,833
is indeed an
attractive prospect...

319
00:18:42,916 --> 00:18:46,208
[AKIKO] I see...
that's quite a tempting idea...

320
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:47,416
[CHUUYA]
Isn't it?

321
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,875
[AKIKO] But I've got
an even better one...

322
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:52,583
I'll hack off your limbs,
one by one,

323
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:56,125
until you decide to tell us
exactly what it is you're up to!

324
00:18:56,208 --> 00:18:59,000
Now that's a brilliant idea.

325
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:00,291
Give it a try then.

326
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:01,250
Now, Kenji!

327
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:03,041
Yes, ma'm!

328
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:07,916
Here we go!

329
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,250
Heh! That's it!

330
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:12,208
Sorry, but this
might hurt a little bit.

331
00:19:13,416 --> 00:19:16,458
This is exactly what
a job oughta be like!

332
00:19:16,541 --> 00:19:18,000
Woo!

333
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,250
What the...?!

334
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:26,916
You're Chuuya Nakahara...

335
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,750
You're the man who can
manipulate gravity, aren't you?

336
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:30,958
[CHUUYA]
Hmph...

337
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:33,208
That damn Dazai must
have spilled the beans.

338
00:19:33,291 --> 00:19:36,458
Even his hat doesn't fall off
when he's upside down like that!

339
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:39,500
City folk really are amazing.

340
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:46,541
[CHUUYA]
So then...

341
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:50,375
Do you really think you're
a match against gravity?!

342
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:54,250
Listen up.

343
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:56,250
I have something to say to you.

344
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:57,458
[CHUUYA]
What?

345
00:19:57,541 --> 00:19:59,000
[YUKICHI]
If we defeat the Guild,

346
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:01,625
you will have effectively
reduced your enemy's strength

347
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:03,708
without lifting a finger.

348
00:20:03,791 --> 00:20:05,833
If you're lucky,
the Agency and the Guild

349
00:20:05,916 --> 00:20:09,291
might end up taking
each other out all together.

350
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:12,208
But you really
have nothing to lose.

351
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:13,458
Am I right?

352
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:16,625
If what you say
is true, then yes.

353
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:17,791
Whatever.

354
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:19,708
So what are you keeping from us?

355
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:21,208
[CHUUYA]
Nothing.

356
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:25,375
There must be some action
the Port Mafia plans to take.

357
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:27,750
You would be wrong
about that one.

358
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:32,000
Now I understand.

359
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:34,666
They don't have
to do anything...

360
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:36,416
Like us, the Guild
would have been wary

361
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,666
of falling into a trap.

362
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:41,750
But in their case,
they went for it.

363
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:45,833
The bait was just too
valuable for them to pass up.

364
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:47,666
What could you have used?

365
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,875
[CHUUYA]
Hmph.

366
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:51,708
No matter what
country you're in,

367
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:55,125
being in nature really
soothes the soul.

368
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:56,541
All right.

369
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:58,625
It look like the Port Mafia's
gift is straight ahead.

370
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:00,250
Why are we doing this,

371
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:03,791
when it's obviously a
trap to lure us out?

372
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:06,291
[STEINBECK]
It was too juicy to pass up.

373
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:07,791
If we succeed in the abduction,

374
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:10,041
we'll have won
against the Agency.

375
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:13,416
You used our
office staff as bait?!

376
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,791
You can still get them
out of there in time.

377
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:19,583
Plus, the Guild has no idea that
you're about to make a move.

378
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:21,291
It'll be an easy win.

379
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:24,083
Rampo, does everything
he just said check out?

380
00:21:24,166 --> 00:21:28,333
It does, unfortunately.

381
00:21:28,416 --> 00:21:32,083
Times like these are when
the truth is most effective.

382
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:34,125
[CHUUYA chuckles]

383
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:36,208
"Even if they know
it's a pitfall,

384
00:21:36,291 --> 00:21:39,666
the Agency will still
fall right into it."

385
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:42,333
The boss was right about that.

386
00:21:42,416 --> 00:21:45,750
[YUKICHI] Order the office staff
to evacuate immediately.

387
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:47,083
And also...

388
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:50,791
...get me Kunikida.

389
00:23:23,375 --> 00:23:26,791
[DOPPO] So only we can
get to them in time?

390
00:23:26,875 --> 00:23:27,958
Yes...

391
00:23:28,041 --> 00:23:29,333
I understand...

392
00:23:29,416 --> 00:23:31,583
We'll head straight there.

393
00:23:35,666 --> 00:23:36,958
Was that the President?

394
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:38,208
Yeah.

395
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:39,708
Uhh...

396
00:23:39,791 --> 00:23:42,291
What did he say?

397
00:23:43,333 --> 00:23:45,375
[DOPPO] We're facing
off against the Guild.

398
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:49,500
[ATSUSHI]
The gifted members of the Guild

399
00:23:49,583 --> 00:23:51,833
are on Naomi and Haruno's tail.

400
00:23:51,916 --> 00:23:55,708
Will Mr. Kunikida and
Junichirou make it in time?

401
00:23:55,791 --> 00:23:58,083
Meanwhile, in order
to stop their escape,

402
00:23:58,166 --> 00:24:01,958
the Port Mafia releases a member
so terrifyingly powerful,

403
00:24:02,041 --> 00:24:04,166
they had to lock him up.

404
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:07,083
Because of that... I...

405
00:24:07,166 --> 00:24:09,375
Next time on <i>Bungo Stray Dogs,</i>

406
00:24:09,458 --> 00:24:12,250
episode 19:
"Will of the Tycoon."

407
00:24:12,333 --> 00:24:15,625
I was supposed to
protect... everyone.
