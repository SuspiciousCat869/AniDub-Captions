1
00:00:11,625 --> 00:00:14,666
I've tracked
you down, weretiger.

2
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:17,750
Akutagawa!

3
00:00:26,375 --> 00:00:29,875
It seems you've improved your
acrobatic skills, weretiger.

4
00:00:29,958 --> 00:00:33,000
What are you
doing here, Akutagawa?

5
00:00:33,083 --> 00:00:35,250
I've come here to kill you.

6
00:00:35,333 --> 00:00:37,166
[ATSUSHI] Don't you
understand the situation

7
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:38,708
we're in right now?

8
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:42,125
There's a good chance we may
not have a home to go back to!

9
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:45,291
No matter how hard I try,
I can't figure you out.

10
00:00:45,375 --> 00:00:48,333
I don't recall ever
asking you to.

11
00:00:48,416 --> 00:00:50,500
[OSAMU]
Oh, dear.

12
00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:54,916
Little Akutagawa still has
a habit of going rogue.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,708
How annoying...

14
00:00:56,791 --> 00:01:00,125
Atsushi, we don't have time
to deal with him right now.

15
00:01:00,208 --> 00:01:02,458
Let's move on.

16
00:01:02,541 --> 00:01:03,333
[ATSUSHI]
But he's--

17
00:01:03,416 --> 00:01:04,875
Trust me on this.

18
00:01:04,958 --> 00:01:07,708
If you follow my instructions,
you won't have any problems.

19
00:01:10,291 --> 00:01:11,291
[ATSUSHI]
Understood.

20
00:01:11,375 --> 00:01:12,958
[AKUTAGAWA]
Hmm?

21
00:01:13,041 --> 00:01:14,125
[ATSUSHI]
Akutagawa...

22
00:01:14,208 --> 00:01:15,583
Dazai's been listening in.

23
00:01:15,666 --> 00:01:17,208
He's on other side
of this device.

24
00:01:17,291 --> 00:01:18,583
[gasps]

25
00:01:18,666 --> 00:01:20,833
[ATSUSHI]
He wants to talk to you.

26
00:01:22,083 --> 00:01:23,916
What have you done?!

27
00:01:33,125 --> 00:01:34,125
Are you there?!

28
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:37,958
[beeping]

29
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:10,291
[FITZGERALD]
Hello, Zelda.

30
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:12,291
How are you, my dear?

31
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:15,708
Yes, I apologize
for calling you so late.

32
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:18,000
You laid off another chef?

33
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:20,291
My darling, you realize
they came all the way here

34
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:23,833
from an esteemed
European restaurant.

35
00:03:23,916 --> 00:03:26,750
Ah, well,
I don't blame you then.

36
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:28,416
You made the right decision.

37
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,875
Any cook that isn't aware

38
00:03:29,958 --> 00:03:32,791
of your distaste for cream
cheese should simply perish.

39
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:39,208
Yes, she's still studying
very hard in London.

40
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:41,333
Of course, I haven't forgotten.

41
00:03:41,416 --> 00:03:44,458
There isn't a moment
I don't think of it.

42
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:46,791
Sorry, it seems I have a guest.

43
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:48,750
I'll call you later.

44
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:49,958
I love you.

45
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:51,791
Take care.

46
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:57,041
[FITZGERALD]
That was a brief farewell, boy.

47
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:59,208
Looking for something?

48
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:00,833
This perhaps?

49
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:04,083
[ATSUSHI] So you're the one
guarding the control terminal.

50
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:05,500
[FITZGERALD]
Let me tell you a secret

51
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:09,666
as to how I've accomplished
as much as I have.

52
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,583
If you want something
to be done correctly,

53
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:15,416
you've got to do it yourself.

54
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:20,166
Tell me, boy, do you know how
much the Moby Dick weighs?

55
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:24,083
It has a total mass
of 29 thousand tons.

56
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:28,458
Dropped from an altitude
of over 6,500 feet,

57
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:33,708
it would explode with
the force of 140 tons of TNT.

58
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:35,041
[ATSUSHI]
That's butchery.

59
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:37,541
No one would allow
such atrocity!

60
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:39,250
[FITZGERALD]
Another piece of advice:

61
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:43,125
Don't let the values
of others affect you.

62
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:44,250
That said,

63
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:46,666
you and I are both busy people.

64
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,375
If we have to fight
over the control terminal,

65
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:51,291
let's keep things simple.

66
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:54,291
We'll both run towards
it on the count of three.

67
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:56,958
The first of us to take
it shall be the victor.

68
00:04:57,041 --> 00:05:00,833
If you win, you may do with
the Moby Dick what you like.

69
00:05:00,916 --> 00:05:03,583
But if I win,
you will agree to serve me

70
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:08,083
in my search of the Book
I told you about before.

71
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:09,625
One...

72
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:13,291
[ATSUSHI] Should I take his
challenge and run when he does?

73
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:14,250
[FITZGERALD]
Two...

74
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:15,583
[ATSUSHI]
What am I thinking?

75
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:17,958
I can't trust him
to keep a promise.

76
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:19,416
I'll just have
to make a dash for it

77
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,416
and get out before he can react!

78
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,416
Three.

79
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:29,458
[FITZGERALD]
Business tip number three:

80
00:05:29,541 --> 00:05:31,750
It's easy to predict
the actions of someone

81
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:36,166
who's given an opportunity
too good to pass up.

82
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,291
Impressive.

83
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:41,625
You still have some wind
left in your lungs, I see.

84
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:45,500
Spending only 10,000
may have been insulting.

85
00:05:45,583 --> 00:05:49,375
How about a hundred thousand
dollars from my own portfolio?

86
00:05:49,458 --> 00:05:51,125
Let's up the ante.

87
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:55,250
Oh, I haven't introduced you
to my ability yet, have I?

88
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:56,833
Let me show you.

89
00:05:56,916 --> 00:05:59,833
Witness "The Great Fitzgerald"!

90
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,791
[FIZTGERALD]
Need an explanation?

91
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:14,083
For however much money I spend,

92
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:17,416
the amount of power
I have rises in turn!

93
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:22,250
You should be honored.

94
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:26,000
I haven't had to use that much
capital in quite some time.

95
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:27,583
My dear Zelda,
on the other hand,

96
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:30,041
could spend that
much in a month.

97
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:33,583
With the Moby Dick on course,
and you under my thumb,

98
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:36,625
everything is going
according to plan.

99
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:38,958
[ATSUSHI]
You... knew I'd come?

100
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:40,666
Our strategist has the ability

101
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:43,208
to make a certain number
of precognitions based

102
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:46,166
on the information
she has available to her.

103

[ATSUSHI screams]

104
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:48,875
[FITZGERALD]
Now that I have you here,

105
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:51,541
it would be a
shame if you got away.

106
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:55,291
I think I should remove your
arms and legs just to be safe.

Otakon?

114

[AKUTAGAWA]
It's Akutagawa.

115

[FITZGERALD]
That's it.

[chiming]

[OSAMU]
Kyouka, can you hear me?

118
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:28,125
It's Dazai.

119
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:31,458
We negotiated with the Gifted
Special Operations Division.

120
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:33,791
We can get you out of there.

121
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:38,333
I'm going to walk you
through how to pilot that drone.

122
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,208
[KYOUKA]
No more.

123
00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:45,875
[OSAMU] Listen,
the truth of the matter is,

124
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:50,708
the Agency doesn't have
a reason to rescue you.

125
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:53,666
You aren't actually
an official member yet.

126
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,291
The Agency has an entrance test

127
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:57,375
that it administers
to all applicants,

128
00:07:57,458 --> 00:07:59,875
and as of now
you haven't passed it.

129
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:01,833
The test is given to see
if you have the heart

130
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:06,875
and strength to help other
people, even complete strangers.

131
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:12,125
[KYOUKA]
I don't think I would pass.

132
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:13,458
[OSAMU sighs]

133
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:16,000
So that's how it is.

134
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:18,625
You believe a former
assassin can no longer

135
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:21,916
become a good person.

136
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,250
For both of our sakes,
I hope that you're wrong.

137
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,125
[FITZGERALD]
Apologies, Mr. Akutagawa,

138
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:35,583
but I'm a bit tied
up at the moment.

139
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:37,916
[AKUTAGAWA] Who gave you
permission to lie around?

140
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
You aren't getting away
from me this time.

141
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:42,541
Stand up and fight!

142
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:45,375
[ATSUSHI] Things really
couldn't get much worse.

143
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:48,583
I was never the right
person for this mission.

144
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:51,583
[AKUTAGAWA] You told me earlier
that you couldn't figure me out.

145
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:53,333
But from where I'm standing...

146
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:56,958
...you're the one who's
completely incomprehensible!

147

Those fearful eyes of yours...

148
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:02,166
You clearly have no faith
in your own abilities.

149
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:05,166
Yet, you still involve
yourself in futile battles.

150

Where does your misguided
sense of morality come from?

151
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:10,041
[FITZGERALD]
That's quite enough, little man.

152
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:14,458
I don't appreciate being
ignored on my own ship.

153
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:15,541
[AKUTAGAWA]
Shut up!

My main course
will be the weretiger.

to wait quietly.

when it comes to anything.

[AKUTAGAWA] He stopped it
with his bare hands!

161
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:42,625
[FITZGERALD]
For your valiant efforts,

162
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:45,833
I'll teach you the
fourth secret to success.

163
00:09:45,916 --> 00:09:47,166
[AKUTAGAWA]
Don't bother.

164
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,666
Rashoumon!

00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,375
Black Torrent!

166
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:54,958
Five hundred grand.

167
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,750
[FITZGERALD]
Now then, where were we?

168
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:10,708
Ah yes, that's right...

169
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:14,208
There are many forms of power
an individual can exercise:

170
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:17,333
money, political influence,
social status.

171
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:19,458
But it helps if you
have all of them

172
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:21,458
at your beck and call,
like I do.

173
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:22,416
Huh?

174
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,083
[FITZGERALD]
He's gone...

175
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:25,958
"Power," my ass!

176
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:27,875
What's the point
of having all that

177
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:30,583
if the only thing you
wanna do is decimate a city?!

178
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:33,583
Real power exists
to be shared with those

179
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:35,583
who are in the
depths of despair!

180
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:38,583
[FITZGERALD]
Your mistake is not surprising.

181
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:41,916
But power does not exist
in order to help the weak.

182
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,041
In fact, the very essence
of money-making is based

183
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:47,250
on extracting profit from them.

184
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:49,166
To then offer
that same profit back

185
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:51,708
to the weak is to
repeat a pointless act,

186
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:55,333
akin to going round and round
through a revolving door.

187
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:58,375
Power must be used
more meaningfully.

188
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:02,041
[ATSUSHI] Is that how you ignore
how many lives are destroyed?

189
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:03,750
Don't pretend you don't know!

190
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:06,458
[FITZGERALD] When you
talk about destroyed lives,

191
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:09,208
are you referring to
weak people like yourself?

192
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:10,833
[gasps]

193
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,083
[FITZGERALD]
I looked up your history.

194
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:15,875
In your early childhood,

195
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:18,875
you were nearly killed by
the head of your orphanage.

196
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:21,166
Twice, in fact.

197
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:23,625
One day,
after breaking your ribs,

198
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:26,958
he had these choice
words for you...

199
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:28,833
[ORPHANAGE MAN 1]
After everything your parents

200
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:31,416
did to you when you
were just an infant,

201
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:35,375
this doesn't even
count as abuse!

202
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:43,833
[FITZGERALD]
We appear to be slowing down

203

We have just over
ten minutes until impact.

[AKUTAGAWA chuckles]

206
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:51,250
[FITZGERALD]
Huh?

207
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:52,958
I see now.

208
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:54,625
[FITZGERALD]
What?!

209

00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,083
They got away?

Earlier, I told you that I found

216

your actions completely
incomprehensible.

217
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:24,208
I take that back.

218
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:26,291
You keep fighting, weretiger,

219
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:31,000
because you feel you need to
earn the permission to exist...

220
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:35,208
You're even willing to sacrifice
of your own life for it.

221
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:38,208
You make me sick.

[screams]

223
00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:43,500
You couldn't be
that naive, could you?

224
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:46,333
No one can grant you
that affirmation!

225
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:49,500
No stamp certifies
that you deserve to live!

Do you think risking your life

227
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:53,875
for others will earn you
a place in this world?!

228
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:57,166
Since when is it
a crime to believe it will?

229
00:12:57,541 --> 00:12:59,250
[AKUTAGAWA]
You're pathetic.

I never expected you'd
be this much of a fool.

231
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:05,291
I could kill you a hundred
times over if I wanted to,

"Accomplish nothing"?

[AKUTAGAWA]
Indeed!

Only victory in battle
has real value.

Without those successes, I'll
never gain any acknowledgment.

237
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:22,458
Especially not from Dazai.

238
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:24,250
What did you say?

239
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:27,583
What exactly does Dazai
have to do with any of this?

in this world, Kyouka.

You clearly have
talent for killing.

Because of that,
you think you have no right

[OSAMU]
Listen to me...

252
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:14,833
You don't know everything
about the Detective Agency

253
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:17,750
and you don't know
everything about yourself.

No one can know everything.

We call those unknown
qualities "potential."

Even Atsushi, who's advocated
for you from beginning,

[ATSUSHI]
What did you say?!

It fills me with shame.

that's not pathetic--

Let me make it clear to
you why you disgust me.

288

you're praised

how lucky you are!

Once that happens,

not even this will stop it
from crashing into the city.

I will be the only
man left standing.

as strong as you, will I no
longer be considered weak?

00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:35,666
[AKUTAGAWA]
Demonic...

317
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,333
Armor!

318
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:51,791
Huh?

319
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:56,416
[FITZGERALD] Is he actually
able to keep up with my gift?

320
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:03,500
[ATSUSHI]
Akutagawa is so strong...

321
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:06,666
How can he still think
of himself as weak?

322
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,791
He's completely irrational!

323
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:12,041
How many people has
he killed because of his ego?

324
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:18,583
[ATSUSHI]
Tiger... grant me your strength.

325
00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:21,083
Just like you did before.

326
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,375
You're in my way, you fool!

327
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:36,750
No, you're in my way!

328
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:38,791
[ATSUSHI]
All this 'cuz of Dazai!

329
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:40,083
Well, Dazai, my ass!

330
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:41,583
You're more pathetic than I am!

331
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:42,791
[AKUTAGAWA]
Shut your mouth!

332
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:44,791
Nothing comes close
to what a loser you are!

333
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:47,166
[FITZGERALD]
So amusing!

334
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:51,416
Look at you two, you're
both so very much alike.

335
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:53,291
What?!

336
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:54,625
Don't you even dare...

337
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:56,250
[AKUTAGAWA]
...compare me...

338
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:58,083
[BOTH]
...to this guy!

339
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,000
[AKUTAGWA] This technique makes
my black armor double as muscle.

340
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:18,708
But my body is too
feeble to sustain it.

341
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:20,875
[ATSUSHI]
You takin' a break, Akutagawa?

342
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:23,291
Shut up. You're next on my list.

343
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:25,500
The control
terminal comes first.

344
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:30,541
If this ship hits the city, even
Dazai won't survive the blast.

345
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:34,291
I'm not sure anything
can kill that man.

346
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:41,583
[FITZGERALD]
Answer me this, Tiger Beetle...

347
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:43,791
is there something in this
world for which it's worth

348
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:47,166
sacrificing anything
and everything you have?

349
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:50,750
For me, it's my family.

350
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:53,083
Once I have the book
in my possession,

351
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:56,333
I'll be able to bring my
daughter back into this world.

352
00:19:56,416 --> 00:19:58,000
Your daughter?

353
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:06,791
My wife, Zelda,

354
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:10,375
she couldn't bring herself to
accept our daughter's death.

355
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:13,041
To this day, she hides in a
fantasy that our daughter

356
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:16,250
is studying abroad in London.

357
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:21,708
I'm going to make that fantasy
a reality and reclaim my family.

358
00:20:21,791 --> 00:20:24,291
I don't care what the cost is.

359
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:28,458
I'll use as much of
my wealth as it takes.

360
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:34,958
I'll spend all of it
if I have to!

361
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:44,833
His power's incredible.

362
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:48,333
It's like standing in front
of a massive tornado.

363
00:20:48,416 --> 00:20:50,208
Is this his real strength...

364
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:53,500
The sheer willpower
of the Guild's leader?

365
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:59,541
[horn blares]

366
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:14,083
Akutagawa...

367
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:16,875
[AKUTAGAWA]
What now?

368
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:20,333
[ATSUSHI]
Am I... a fool?

369
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:24,375
Is it even possible for me
to escape from my memories?

370
00:21:24,458 --> 00:21:26,875
[AKUTAGAWA]
Of course, it is.

371
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:30,125
The words from your past are
fundamentally meaningless.

372
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:33,166
They do not dictate
who you are now.

373
00:21:39,541 --> 00:21:41,291
I see.

374
00:21:43,458 --> 00:21:44,958
[ATSUSHI]
For what it's worth,

375
00:21:45,041 --> 00:21:48,750
I think Dazai acknowledged
you a long time ago.

376
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:58,000
Bring it.

377
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:01,291
Ability... Beast
Beneath the Moonlight!

378
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:06,000
Rashoumon: Demonic Armor!

379
00:23:47,666 --> 00:23:50,458
[OSAMU] Your suffering
isn't yours alone.

380
00:23:50,541 --> 00:23:51,916
What should one decide to do

381
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,375
if their talents don't
match their ambitions?

382
00:23:55,458 --> 00:23:57,166
Everyone on this
planet is searching

383
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:59,291
to find meaning in their life.

384
00:23:59,375 --> 00:24:02,375
What is it that will give
them that satisfaction?

385
00:24:02,458 --> 00:24:04,041
What are they looking for?

386
00:24:04,125 --> 00:24:06,125
The answer remains elusive.

387
00:24:06,208 --> 00:24:08,125
The only certainty we have

388
00:24:08,208 --> 00:24:11,458
is that we're not
certain of anything.

389
00:24:11,541 --> 00:24:13,791
Next time, episode 24:

390
00:24:13,875 --> 00:24:17,041
"If I May Shed Away
My Burden Now."
