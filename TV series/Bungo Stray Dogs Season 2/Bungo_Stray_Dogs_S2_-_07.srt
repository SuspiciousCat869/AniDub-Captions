1
00:00:15,416 --> 00:00:16,750
Quick, step on it!

2
00:00:16,833 --> 00:00:19,500
We need to get as much distance
from here as possible!

3
00:00:22,541 --> 00:00:25,375
[KIRAKO] Hey, Naomi, are
you sure they'll come for us?

4
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:27,416
The people from the Agency?

5
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,875
I have faith in my brother.

6
00:00:29,958 --> 00:00:32,916
I'm know he'll come and
get us out of this mess.

7
00:00:37,083 --> 00:00:38,750
[STEINBECK]
What a great lodge!

8
00:00:38,833 --> 00:00:41,541
If we plowed the land, we
could grow a nice orchard here!

9
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:43,500
Shall I capture the girls?

10
00:00:43,583 --> 00:00:45,208
You'd just end up
ripping their heads off

11
00:00:45,291 --> 00:00:47,291
if we used your ability.

12
00:00:47,375 --> 00:00:49,625
Why don't we use mine instead?

13
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:25,208
There you are.

14
00:02:58,083 --> 00:02:59,375
[crunch]

15
00:02:59,458 --> 00:03:01,083
Huh?

16
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:01,916
What the--?!

17
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,541
Something's lifting the car!

18
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:05,250
I can't open the door!

19
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:10,208
Are those roots? Ah!

20
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:12,875
If this keeps up we're
gonna get totally crushed!

21
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,250
That must have been scary.

22
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:21,833
Apologies, m'ladies!

23
00:03:21,916 --> 00:03:25,958
Tell me, do either of you
know much about grape vines?

24
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:27,375
What they do is

25
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:30,583
they seek out other plants
to attach themselves to,

26
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:33,333
and then graft their
shoots together.

27
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:35,375
Allow me to demonstrate.

28
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:38,041
[STEINBECK]
By merging my grape vines

29
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:39,750
with the surrounding flora,

30
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:42,083
I can use all the
plants in this area

31
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:45,250
as an extension
of my own body.

32
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:47,708
And because the senses
of this vegetation are in tune

33
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:50,458
with my own,
I'm afraid that running away

34
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:52,833
from me is simply
an impossibility.

35
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:57,208
Now, now, don't look so upset.

36
00:03:57,291 --> 00:03:59,333
All I need is a little favor.

37
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:01,416
When a villain asks
you for a "favor,"

38
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,416
all they're going to do is
take something from you

39
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,750
and then throw you away.

40
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:07,416
Not everyone is
the Guild is pure evil.

41
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,750
I'm just pragmatic.

42
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:12,625
I have a really large
family back home.

43
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:16,750
Every time we have dinner,
it feels almost like a war zone.

44
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:19,958
I have a sister who's about
your age who loves pie,

45
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:22,125
and always takes my share.

46
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:24,916
But she's so adorable,
I let her get away with it.

47
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,875
Could you do
the same for us then?

48
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:29,541
[screams]

49
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:32,250
I'm sorry if I gave
you the wrong impression.

50
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:36,500
The work's a bit seedy, but
the pay itself is quite good.

51
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:37,958
If I were to lose my job,

52
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:41,000
--my family would starve.
--Please, stop this!

53
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:43,041
This is for my sister...

54
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:47,166
I don't care in the slightest
what happens to you two.

55
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,875
[LOVECRAFT]
Hm?

56
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:52,000
Snow? In this season?

57
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,375
[gunshot]

58
00:04:57,458 --> 00:04:58,708
[STEINBECK]
Oh?!

59
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:02,708
[JUNICHIROU]
Naomi! You guys okay?

60
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:03,875
Junichirou!

61
00:05:03,958 --> 00:05:05,125
Listen to me.

62
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:07,375
In five minutes,
a train's gonna pass by here.

63
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:09,791
Kunikida and I will take
care of these Guild guys.

64
00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:11,708
You just get on that train.

65
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:12,750
I'll be okay!

66
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:15,083
Just keep running!

67
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:17,250
[STEINBECK] I had a
feeling this might happen.

68
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:21,000
It seems my sources weren't
as reliable as I thought.

69
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:23,458
[DOPPO] If I understand
his ability correctly,

70
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:25,583
he could use his power
to manipulate the roots

71
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:30,000
at the base of this hill,
effectively stopping the train.

72
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:33,041
If I can keep him occupied
for the next five minutes,

73
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:36,416
that should buy enough time
for our people to escape.

74
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:41,208
[JUNICHIROU]
Kunikida!

75
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:42,791
[STEINBECK]
Let me guess,

76
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:45,416
your plan is to keep me
away from the vegetation,

77
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,666
so I can't use my powers
to stop those girls.

78
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:51,208
If you oversimplify
battle strategy,

79
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:53,416
you become easy to predict.

80
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,625
Is that so?

81
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:57,375
I'll have to write that
down in my notebook.

82
00:05:57,458 --> 00:06:01,291
By that same token, allow me
to guess your line of thinking;

83
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:06,333
If you remove my firearm,
you remove any means of attack.

84
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:08,500
Doppo Poetry!

85
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:22,916
"If you oversimplify
battle strategy,

86
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,291
you become easy to predict."

87
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:27,958
You should heed your own words.

88
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:32,708
A secret group from a superpower
goes abroad to abduct people.

89
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:34,791
[STEINBECK]
Those are hurtful words.

90
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:36,833
But as my boss once said,

91
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:40,291
the purpose of the Guild isn't
to be a force for good...

92
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:43,041
...it's to do what
needs to be done.

93
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:43,916
[gasps]

94
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,541
Kunikida, behind you!

95
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:50,416
[DOPPO] Does his ability
make him immune to bullets?

96
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,791
[STEINBECK]
You're late, Lovecraft.

97
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:54,541
What took you so long?

98
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:55,666
[LOVECRAFT]
I was sleeping.

99
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,291
[STEINBECK]
Oh, you.

100
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,500
[LOVECRAFT]
Sorry.

101
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:00,333
Junichirou!

102
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:02,833
Use your ability to hide!

103
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:08,625
Is this even possible?

104
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:11,291
I've never seen
a gift this powerful!

105
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:13,541
[LOVECRAFT]
Are we supposed to kill them?

106
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:14,875
[STEINBECK]
I'm not sure.

107
00:07:14,958 --> 00:07:17,750
We can ask for orders
after we catch the girls.

108
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:20,083
Let's see where they are...

109
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,000
[NAOMI]
There it is!

110
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:27,583
[KIRAKO cries out]

111
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:29,000
Haruno!

112
00:07:32,041 --> 00:07:34,083
It's leaving...

113
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:34,875
[STEINBECK]
All right.

114
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:36,625
That wraps up our story.

115
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:39,875
Let's get out of here
before the police show up.

116
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:41,250
[JUNICHIROU]
There's no point hiding myself

117
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:43,041
with Light Snow now.

118
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:45,041
What else can I do?

119
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:48,500
I'm borrowing
your sister for a bit!

120
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:51,250
[JUNICHIROU] What are
you gonna do with Naomi?

121
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:53,916
She'll be out of my hands,
so I couldn't say.

122
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,333
If I had to guess,
they'll probably torture her.

123
00:07:56,416 --> 00:07:58,791
You'll never get away with
this outrage, you bastard!

124
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:00,500
[STEINBECK]
This is just a job.

125
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:02,833
But I realize that's
something you moralists

126
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:05,000
could never understand.

127
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:06,625
Moralists?

128
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:09,333
[STEINBECK]
Huh?

129
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:11,708
A truck?

130
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:14,416
Things could get nasty
if we're seen like this.

131
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:18,125
[JUNICHIROU] It's true that the
Agency has a set of morals.

132
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:22,166
But when it comes to Naomi, it's
a different thing altogether.

133
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:26,416
You can talk about
justice or morality,

134
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,916
but her life means more to me

135
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,708
than all of those
things combined.

136
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:34,625
[STEINBECK]
That's strange...

137
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:37,666
Hasn't the driver
noticed us by now?

138
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,583
No way!

00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:44,125
Do we look like part
of the road to you?!

[JUNICHIROU]
If it was for Naomi,

141
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:50,125
I would gladly burn
this world to the ground!

142
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,875
The roots let go!

00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:57,333

[STEINBECK]
Do you know where they went?

149
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:32,166
I can't sense them.

150
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:36,333
It seems that they...
hid themselves.

151
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:37,125
Damn it.

Freeze!

H.Q., we've located the suspects
of the reported kidnappings.

155
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:53,208
Looks like the Agency
called us in ahead of time.

The head of the

You can definitely count on
Mr. Mori for a number of things.

And that includes taking
advantage of our weak spots

especially while we
have our guard down.

00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:17,333
All right, we should
be safe here for now.

163
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:19,208
[KIRAKO]
Thank goodness.

164
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:21,875
I'm sorry!

165
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:33,875
Did you say sorry?

166
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:36,041
I should apologize as well.

167
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:37,583
Are you hurt?

168
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:43,708
[OSAMU]
Atsushi.

169
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:45,166
What's up?

170
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:47,083
[OSAMU] There's an urgent
errand I need to carry out.

171
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:49,333
[ATSUSHI]
What is it?!

172
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:51,083
I need to use the bathroom.

173
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:54,166
[OSAMU]
I'm not gonna make it!

174
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:06,791
[OSAMU]
There's no one else around.

175
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,708
You can come out now

176
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,250
Nice to see you Gin.

177
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:13,041
Have you've gotten taller?

178
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:17,875
How did you know we were
watching you this whole time?

179
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:19,875
[OSAMU]
Well, I was the one who created

180
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:22,791
all of the Port Mafia's
surveillance techniques.

181
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:24,750
So... what do you want from me?

182
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:27,458
[ICHIYOU] Doesn't this
gun tell you what we want?

183
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:29,000
[OSAMU]
Seriously?

184
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:33,291
I think you guys could benefit
from better veiled threats.

185
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:35,500
And, Gin, could
you put this away?

186
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:37,416
It's dangerous.

187
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:42,041
We didn't come
here to take your life.

188
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:44,791
I have a message addressed
to you from the boss.

189
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:46,708
[OSAMU]
Really, from Mr. Mori?

190
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:48,666
I'm on the edge of my seat!

191
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:51,291
The message is this:

192
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:53,291
[OUGAI]
Dear Dazai,

193
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:57,208
would you like to return to
the Port Mafia as an executive?

194
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:02,458
[OSAMU laughs]

195
00:12:02,541 --> 00:12:06,500
Wow, that is such a
pleasant invitation.

196
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:08,250
[ICHIYOU] I've looked
through your records.

197
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:11,791
Your blood is Port Mafia black.

198
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:14,041
More so than
anyone in the country.

199
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:15,875
What can I say, people change.

200
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:18,333
I mean, take Gin
here for example.

201
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:20,666
I remember when
you were only this big.

202
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:23,000
You were such
a dainty little lass!

203
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:26,125
[GIN]
Don't change the subject.

204
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:29,666
[ICHIYOU]
Gin's... a girl?!

205
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:38,500
[ATSUSHI]
Haruna, Naomi...

206
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:39,708
Are you all right?

207
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:41,250
[NAOMI]
We are.

208
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:43,583
I never thought they'd come
after the clerks in the office.

209
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:45,125
At least you're safe now.

210
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:48,875
We're gonna escort you
both to the extraction point.

211
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:51,333
[OSAMU]
Something doesn't add up here.

212
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:55,375
Why would Ougai allocate his
trusted staff for this charade?

213
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:56,833
[ICHIYOU]
It's to protect you.

214
00:12:56,916 --> 00:12:59,125
[OSAMU]
Protect me from what?

215
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:02,125
The boss has decided to
release Q from his prison.

216
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:03,916
[OSAMU gasps]

217
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:07,000
[NAOMI] Oh, I wanted
you to meet someone!

218
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:10,083
We got to know each
other a little on the train.

219
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,000
[ATSUSHI]
What is this?!

220
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:26,041
He has razor blades
taped to his arm...

221
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:27,583
That would mean

222
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:32,666
even the slightest
bump would cut him up.

223
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:35,208
Wanna play a game?

224
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:36,833
[OSAMU]
What stupidity!

225
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:39,458
Do you have any idea
what he's unleashed?

226
00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:41,416
Q is a walking catastrophe.

227
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:44,083
He'll doom everyone,
friend and foe alike.

228
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:45,958
[ICHIYOU] The Port Mafia
achieves its ends

229
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:48,958
by any means necessary.

230
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:53,416
Do you even know why Q was
imprisoned in the first place?

231
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,083
Kyuuuuuuu!

232
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:58,666
[OSAMU] He has the
most vile gift of them all;

233
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:02,583
the ability to control
people's minds.

234
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,833
Better act fast if
you don't wanna die!

235
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:17,291
[ATSUSHI] This must
be the enemy's ability.

236
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:20,166
I have to do what
I can to protect them!

237
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:24,083
[ORPHANAGE MAN 1]
What can you hope to accomplish?

238
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:27,208
You're not capable
of saving anyone.

239
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:28,750
[ATSUSHI]
You're wrong.

240
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:31,500
I'm not the same as before.

241
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:33,958
I'm so much stronger now!

242
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,625
Sorry about this.

243
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,625
[OSAMU] Q's curse
induces hallucinations,

244
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:47,208
causing his enemies
to attack those

245
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:50,208
around them indiscriminately.

246
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:53,416
The curse is activated only when
Q's doll has been mutilated.

247
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,666
[DOLL laughs]

248
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:58,208
However, even when
this event is triggered,

249
00:14:58,291 --> 00:15:00,916
only a designated
receiver is affected.

250
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,166
In order to be targeted by Q,
that person has to hurt him.

251
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:08,250
You can tell who a receiver
is by the bruise-like mark

252
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:12,166
on their body, similar to
being grabbed or strangled.

253
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:16,041
[OSAMU] You mentioned
before that you came here

00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:17,916
to protect me

[ATSUSHI]
No way...

261
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:44,958
The only one being
manipulated was me?

262
00:15:45,041 --> 00:15:48,208
All I wanted to do was
to protect everyone.

263
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:50,833
[ORPHANAGE MAN 1]
All of this is your fault.

No! I can change, I swear!

[AKUTAGAWA]
So then...

270
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:14,750
...do you understand
who you are now?

00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:16,083

[Q] Your new friends
are so fragile, Mr. Dazai.

00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:28,333
But don't worry.

00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:32,541
What I really look forward
to is breaking you.

Remember how you made me suffer?

277
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:38,375
Soon you're going to
feel the pain, Mr. Dazai.

278
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:40,625
And instead of
capturing you next time,

279
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,458
I'll just rip your heart out.

280
00:16:42,541 --> 00:16:44,125
Can't wait to play again!

281

Come on, get up Atsushi.

It's time to go.

284
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:00,375
I'm just no good!

285
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:02,875
I should've never been born!

286
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:08,625
Look at me.

287
00:17:15,708 --> 00:17:18,583
Listen to me very closely.

288
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:22,708
I'll give you some advice,
like a proper senpai.

289
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:25,541
Don't pity yourself.

290
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:30,083
Once you go down that road, life
turns into an endless nightmare.

291
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:38,166
Now then, it appears
that the enemy

292
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:40,916
has forced our collective
hand on this one.

293
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,791
They've played
their trump card,

294
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:45,750
so I guess we'll
have to follow suit.

an epic novel about it?

Uhh, no!

[FITZGERALD]
I'll read it along the way.

Where's our next mission site?

304

I-It's not safe right now!

The <i>Zelda</i> was just destroyed.

00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:16,875
I'd feel much better if you
stayed here, Lord Francis.

307
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:20,083
Wherever I go is where
the home of the Guild lies.

Hello, young one.

320
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:07,583
[ANGO] Just how
long has it been, Dazai?

321
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:10,875
I have to say I was surprised
when I received your call.

322
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:12,041
Ango!

323
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:14,166
You're looking well!

324
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:18,291
I'm really glad you came out.

325
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:20,041
But be honest with me,

326
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:23,416
did you really think that I'd
forgiven your double-crossing?

327
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:27,250
I'm just kidding.

328
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:30,333
I bet you left this thing
unloaded anyway.

329
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:32,208
What do you want?

330
00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:35,250
[KOUYOU]
I see.

331
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:37,541
The Gifted
Operations Division...

332
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:41,041
They're the strongest of
all the gifted organizations.

333
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:42,625
Get them to join your side,

334
00:19:42,708 --> 00:19:46,166
and they'll be sure to become
the Agency's greatest weapon.

335
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:47,916
If that actually happens,

336
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,750
then Kyouka might be able
to come back to us soon.

337
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:52,500
I wonder...

338
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:55,583
Tell me, boy, do
you truly believe

339
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:59,000
that with only a few short
months of combat training,

340
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:01,750
a girl can murder 35 people...

341
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:04,625
...at only fourteen?

342
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:06,416
It's her gift.

343
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:10,916
And for as long as that gift is
bound to her soul, her being,

344
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,500
she will never
escape the darkness.

345
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:16,666
Much the same way
that I never could.

346
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:23,416
I ask you... look after Kyouka.

347
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:27,750
Isn't your job to go after
gifted crime groups?

348
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:29,666
It was the last time
I checked anyway.

349
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:32,166
Someone's having a
hard time keeping up.

350
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:35,541
If it's about the Guild,
we're aware of their activities.

351
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:37,958
And yet you guys still
let them off the hook?

352
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:40,875
They applied pressure on a
number of political players,

353
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:42,125
and thereby acquired

354
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:45,125
a comparable level
of diplomatic immunities.

355
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:47,250
They're practically
above the law now.

356
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:48,541
The police don't
even have the power

357
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:51,791
to take the Guild's
members into custody.

358
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:55,916
You need to get
out of here, Dazai.

359
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,041
Right now.

360
00:20:57,125 --> 00:20:58,208
Tell everyone at the Agency

361
00:20:58,291 --> 00:20:59,166
--[OSAMU] Ango...
--that their lives are

362
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:01,041
in danger and that they--

363
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:09,750
[ATSUSHI]
Dazai's taking a while.

364
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:12,250
[FITZGERALD]
Been waiting long?

365
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:13,625
[gasps]

366
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:19,208
Such a predictable reaction.

367
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:20,541
How dull.

368
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:22,750
[ATSUSHI] Does he have
special combat abilities?

369
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:24,500
He's strong!

370
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:27,583
But if I can take him
down, this war is over!

371
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:33,458
[FITZGERALD]
That was a really nice kick.

372
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:36,000
I'd say it was worth
about ten grand.

373
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:37,291
However...

374
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:41,875
[FITZGERALD]
...it doesn't come close

375
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:45,125
to the bounty of seven
billion we put on you.

376
00:21:45,208 --> 00:21:48,500
Not what I'd call
a great return.

377
00:21:48,583 --> 00:21:50,833
But I wouldn't feel too badly.

378
00:21:50,916 --> 00:21:52,875
You have other assets.

379
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:57,750
Now, time to come with me.

380
00:21:57,833 --> 00:22:01,166
[ATSUSHI] It's the same
thing all over again.

381
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:04,083
I'm right back
to where I started.

382
00:22:04,708 --> 00:22:05,708
[KYOUKA]
Hold it.

383
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:06,875
[FITZGERALD]
Hmm?

384
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:08,666
[ATSUSHI]
Huh?

385
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:16,833
[ATSUSHI]
Kyouka... so then you...

386
00:23:48,291 --> 00:23:50,000
[ATSUSHI] The Guild
begins its nefarious plot

387
00:23:50,083 --> 00:23:54,291
that could lead to the
destruction of all of Yokohama.

388
00:23:54,375 --> 00:23:56,750
I remember a book that
I'd read a long time ago

389
00:23:56,833 --> 00:23:59,166
once had this to say:

390
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:02,583
"I've never regretted any
of the things I've done.

391
00:24:02,666 --> 00:24:07,458
I've only regretted
the things that I didn't do."

392
00:24:07,541 --> 00:24:09,625
Next time on <i>Bungo Stray Dogs,</i>

393
00:24:09,708 --> 00:24:13,500
episode 20: "Though the
Mind May be Wrong."

394
00:24:13,583 --> 00:24:14,875
This time...

395
00:24:14,958 --> 00:24:17,041
I'm going to protect everyone.
