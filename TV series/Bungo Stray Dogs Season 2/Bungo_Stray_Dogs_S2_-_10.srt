1
00:00:08,625 --> 00:00:11,625
[RAMPO] To think I'd receive
a challenge from the Guild.

2
00:00:11,708 --> 00:00:14,666
Hopefully this'll stave
off my boredom for a bit.

3
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:16,875
[AKIKO]
Feels like a trap to me.

4
00:00:18,291 --> 00:00:21,416
Looks like he wants you to
fill in the correct answers.

5
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,125
Afraid I can't help you there.

6
00:00:26,916 --> 00:00:29,833
Wouldn't happen to have a
pen on you by any chance...?

7
00:00:35,333 --> 00:00:36,375
[RAMPO]
Are you the mastermind

8
00:00:36,458 --> 00:00:39,000
who issued a challenge
against me?

9
00:00:39,083 --> 00:00:40,333
[POE chuckles]

10
00:00:40,416 --> 00:00:42,500
It's been a long time, Rampo.

11
00:00:42,583 --> 00:00:44,791
Were you able to solve
the riddle I left you

12
00:00:44,875 --> 00:00:46,416
at the entrance?

13
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,875
Of course,

14
00:00:47,958 --> 00:00:51,458
I'd expect nothing less from
you, my worthy adversary.

15
00:00:51,541 --> 00:00:54,875
I believe that I've earned
myself a question.

16
00:00:57,166 --> 00:00:58,083
Who are you again?

17
00:00:58,166 --> 00:00:59,000
Huh?!

18
00:00:59,083 --> 00:01:01,625
You... don't remember me?

19
00:01:01,708 --> 00:01:04,000
The reason I joined the
Guild in the first place

20
00:01:04,083 --> 00:01:07,208
was so that I could redeem
myself against you!

21
00:01:07,291 --> 00:01:08,458
I am Poe!

22
00:01:08,541 --> 00:01:11,083
For the past six,
grueling years of my life,

23
00:01:11,166 --> 00:01:13,458
I have endured the crushing
shame of being bested

24
00:01:13,541 --> 00:01:14,666
by the likes of--

25
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:15,875
Um, yeah, could you
speed this up, please?

26
00:01:15,958 --> 00:01:17,250
You're boring me to sleep.

27
00:01:17,333 --> 00:01:19,708
Gah! I'm setting up
the backstory here!

28
00:01:19,791 --> 00:01:21,333
This is a game
between detectives.

29
00:01:21,416 --> 00:01:23,166
You read the
mystery novel I've written,

30
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,416
and then use your skills
to determine the identity

31
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:26,750
of the serial killer.

32
00:01:26,833 --> 00:01:29,041
[RAMPO]
You're already losing points.

33
00:01:29,125 --> 00:01:32,125
You can't even decide if you
are a detective or a writer.

34
00:01:32,208 --> 00:01:35,541
[POE]
Ooh, the plot thickens.

35
00:01:35,625 --> 00:01:37,875
If you can solve my mystery,

36
00:01:37,958 --> 00:01:41,375
I will reveal to you
the Guild's weakness.

37
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,708
The floating fortress
that is the Moby Dick

38
00:01:45,791 --> 00:01:48,208
will stand no chance
against your assault.

39
00:01:48,291 --> 00:01:49,875
[RAMPO]
Okay, now you've earned a point.

40
00:01:49,958 --> 00:01:53,208
But why dole out such a silly
challenge in the first place?

41
00:01:53,291 --> 00:01:57,666
[POE] The Guild's operations are
barbaric and unbearably dull.

42
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,541
There's only one
thing that humanity

43
00:01:59,625 --> 00:02:01,958
ought to have a
curiosity about,

44
00:02:02,041 --> 00:02:06,583
and that's your ability,
Ultra Deduction.

45
00:02:06,666 --> 00:02:07,750
Am I wrong?

46
00:02:07,833 --> 00:02:10,083
Nope, you're not! Yoink!

47
00:02:10,166 --> 00:02:13,750
Let's do this. Heh!

48
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:16,750
Allow me to set
the scene of our story...

49
00:02:16,833 --> 00:02:20,583
Once upon a time, a band of
travelers found themselves

50
00:02:20,666 --> 00:02:25,083
trapped in a mansion as a
result of a fearsome snowstorm.

51
00:02:25,166 --> 00:02:27,750
On this dark and stormy night,

52
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:32,958
our protagonist is awakened
by a strange sound.

53
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,791
Bear witness to my gift!

54
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:44,583
The ability to draw a reader
into the world of a novel!

55
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:47,416
[POE] I hope that you
both enjoy your stay.

56
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:56,291
[POE]
The protagonist opened a door

57
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:59,125
with a key only he possessed.

58
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,166
[POE]
And what he found there...

59
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:07,625
[RAMPO]
...was a victim.

60
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:10,166
The windows were sealed,

61
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:12,166
making it impossible for
anyone to have entered

62
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,500
or left in such a manner.

63
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:17,625
Two doors, and a matching key...

64
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:19,291
[RAMPO gasps]

65
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:26,125
My glasses are gone...

66
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:27,500
Is he really dead?

67
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:28,791
Everybody stand back!

68
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,958
I'm a doctor.

69
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:32,291
Sir!

70
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:35,250
Uh... Th... The door...

71
00:03:41,958 --> 00:03:45,375
Poe stipulated that
this was a serial killer.

72
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:47,625
If we don't track
the killer down,

73
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:51,333
the rest of us may soon
become victims as well.

74
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:58,625
[AKIKO] Poe's ability is
a serious pain in the ass.

75
00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:00,083
The corpse, the blood,

76
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:03,375
everything about the crime
is disgustingly convincing.

77
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:04,666
On top of that,

78
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:07,208
my healing ability doesn't
appear to work here.

79
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:10,000
Cause of death appears
to be hypovolemic shock.

80
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,541
I was told he was
the mansion's caretaker.

81
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:15,250
No fingerprints on the
weapon to speak of either.

82
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:18,125
It's the quintessential
impossible crime.

83
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:20,291
A locked room with no
apparent way for anyone

84
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:22,458
to go in or out of it.

85
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:26,166
How was the killer able leave
the room after the murder?

86
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:28,750
You're sitting there struggling
with all these questions.

87
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:31,375
Why don't use
your ability already?

88
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:33,541
I've lost my glasses.

89
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:36,666
They were a special pair
that the boss gave me.

90
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:39,791
I need them to in order
to activate my gift.

91
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:41,000
But what difference
does it make?

92
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:42,416
Didn't you just mention

93
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,625
that your healing ability
wasn't working on the guy?

94
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:47,000
Then my powers
of Ultra Deduction

95
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:49,125
probably wouldn't work
in this place either.

96
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:53,750
Uhh... So that's how
it's going to be, isn't it?

97
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:56,625
Rampo still doesn't realize
he's just an ordinary person

98
00:04:56,708 --> 00:05:01,625
who doesn't actually have
any special abilities.

99
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:03,916
Then how about the two of us
investigate the crime scene

100
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,583
and try to piece together
what happened?

101
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:07,541
Get real, that sounds
so lame and boring!

102
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:09,333
I don't wanna do
all that tedious work!

103
00:05:09,416 --> 00:05:13,291
That stuff's for suckers,
not Master Detectives like me!

104
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:22,291
Of course, I didn't off the guy.

105
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:25,125
I had nothing to do
with it either, I swear!

106
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:27,208
I wouldn't do
anything like that.

107
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:31,291
I don't even know why I'm under
suspicion in the first place.

108
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:33,583
Do any of you have an alibi?

109
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,625
I was still sleeping in my room.

110
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:37,125
I was gathering firewood

111
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:39,416
from the kitchen
to use in my fireplace.

112
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,875
I was in the library looking
up the famous curse

113
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:44,500
of this mansion,
Pluto, the one-eyed cat.

114
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:46,125
Why do I have to explain myself?

115
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:47,625
You're just a doctor.

116
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:49,833
Just who do you think you
are to question me like this?

117
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:50,625
Eek!

118
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:52,541
Huuuuuuh?

119
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:54,541
[shudders]

120
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:56,541
I was only joking,
I guess it wasn't funny.

121
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:57,916
I'll gladly tell you
where I was!

122
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,250
I had gone back to my room

123
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:01,166
for the night to arrange
my wardrobe for tomorrow.

124
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:02,250
[REIDA]
There was a painting of Pluto

125
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:03,958
in the room he was found in...

126
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:05,083
Was it the curse?!

127
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:06,708
The key to the
locked room was found

128
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:08,416
inside the victim's clothes,

129
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,083
so I bet you this is a
trick involving strings!

130
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:15,041
The single matching key was
never used until right before.

131
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:18,291
The suspect killed the
caretaker, took the key,

132
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:23,708
and locked the room
from the outside.

133
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:26,875
The killer then used a string to
pull the key under the door

134
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:29,166
and returned it to his pocket.

135
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:32,333
He cut the string, collected it,
and disposed of it.

136
00:06:32,416 --> 00:06:34,166
What do you think, detective?

137
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:35,708
[RAMPO]
Are you a complete moron?

138
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:36,833
[UKAI]
Wha?

139
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:39,708
Sorry, rhetorical
questions are rude.

140
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:41,333
You are a moron.

141
00:06:41,416 --> 00:06:44,208
The key's too thick to be
able to fit under the door.

142
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:46,416
Not only that, but the
corpse was on his back

143
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,750
and the key was
in his hip pocket.

144
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:50,666
Did none of that
even occur to you?

145
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:53,083
Uh... Well then...
what if the killer

146
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:55,625
removed the iron bars on
the window, went through it,

147
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:58,833
and used tools to put
the iron bars back again!

148
00:06:58,916 --> 00:07:01,250
That'd be quite a trick
to pull off in a snowstorm

149
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:03,666
you can barely see through.

150
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:07,375
There also would've been melted
snow outside the window.

151
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:11,833
You're really on a roll,
aren't you Rampo?

152
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:14,041
[RAMPO]
I'm not!

153
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:18,208
[RAMPO]
I'm not.

154
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:22,916
[AKIKO] With your
abilities as a detective,

155
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,500
you must have drawn
some kind of hypothesis...

156
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:27,666
[RAMPO] I can't do any of
that if I'm not able to use

157
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:30,500
my special Ultra
Deduction ability...

158
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:33,541
I need to have the glasses
the boss gave me!

159
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:36,708
Or are you trying to say that
he lied to me about all of that?

160
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:37,750
[gsaps]

161
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:41,541
Of course not.

162
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:44,166
You're absolutely right, Rampo.

163
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:50,375
[POE laughs]

164
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:53,625
Not even you will be able
to solve this mystery.

165
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:55,833
It's a remarkably
unusual puzzle I've written

166
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:59,375
specifically for
you, my dear Rampo.

167
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:01,791
Once you're in the book,
it's all but over.

168
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:06,333
You'll never figure out who the
killer is or how they did it.

169
00:08:06,416 --> 00:08:08,333
This is no mere challenge.

170
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:11,375
This is revenge!

171
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:14,666
Unlike you, I will never forget
the day when you defeated me

172
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,500
in a battle of wits.

173
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:18,375
I was so thoroughly humiliated

174
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:21,750
I could barely look
anyone in the eye.

175
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:24,875
I felt like I was lost
in a dark maze.

176
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:27,625
But I found a reason
to press on...

177
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:30,333
...and that was to receive
the same bountiful praise

178
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:32,625
and adulation that you did.

179
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:36,916
Maybe then I would attain
the peace of mind I craved.

180
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:42,375
[POE]
That warmth will belong to me...

181
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:45,833
...even if it means taking
it from you by force.

182
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:51,125
If I understand the
killer's MO correctly,

183
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:53,916
locking myself up in this room
will surely put me at risk

184
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
of being their next victim.

185
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:58,833
They better not
keep me waiting long.

186
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:10,000
[AKIKO moans]

187
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,833
[RAMPO]
Doctor Yosano...

188
00:09:13,916 --> 00:09:15,208
Sorry.

189
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:17,625
It looks like I messed up.

190
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:20,375
I didn't see...
who the killer was.

191
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:21,041
[RAMPO]
Stop!

192
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:22,041
Save your strength.

193
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:24,041
[AKIKO]
I'm no help at all.

194
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:28,583
But... for the world's
greatest detective...

195
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:33,125
I'm sure it'll be... no problem.

196
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:35,916
The Armed Detective
Agency was established

197
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,541
with the sole purpose
of making use of your gift,

198
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:41,708
for the sake of innocent people.

199
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:44,208
[gasps]

200
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:49,166
I'm grateful... that I was
invited to the Agency...

201
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:52,250
...and met... you all...

202
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:07,208
[POE laughs]

203
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:08,458
That's one enemy down!

204
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,291
Unless you solve my mystery,

205
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:13,250
you will spend the rest of
eternity wandering aimlessly

206
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:15,958
through the hell-scape
that I've created!

207
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:21,125
[laughs]

208
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:24,791
Miss us?

209
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:26,375
[POE]
What?! Impossible!

210
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:28,291
You couldn't have
solved the mystery!

211
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:31,500
[RAMPO] I'll admit, it was quite
an impressive piece of work.

212
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:35,208
You just made one mistake
and that was challenging me.

213
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:38,208
[POE] Y-You actually figured
out who the killer was?

214
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:40,375
[RAMPO]
Of course.

215
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:42,083
The murderer...

216
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:46,583
...was me.

217
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:48,791
The locked room had
nothing to do with it.

218
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:50,916
The protagonist killed the
victim, and the author

219
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,375
deliberately omitted
that part of the narration.

220
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:57,500
The truly ingenious element
was how you managed

221
00:10:57,583 --> 00:11:00,041
to conceal any evidence
of the killer's presence

222
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:02,500
once I entered the scene.

223
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:04,750
No matter how
thoroughly I searched,

224
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:07,833
it seemed like the murderer
never even existed.

225
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:09,916
How did you figure
it all out then?

226
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,041
[RAMPO]
You went too far

227
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:13,375
with the murder in
a locked-room theme.

228
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:16,041
It'd be one thing if you
singled someone out,

229
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:19,458
but the killer had no motive
to create such a puzzle.

230
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:22,000
That's when I figured it out:

231
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:25,583
The killer and the
author were in cahoots.

232
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:27,916
The proof of that was in the
glove used for the murder

233
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,083
that was hidden behind
the door under the brick wall.

234
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:35,625
The caretaker pointed to
the wall just before he died.

235
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:38,125
That may account for
the first of the killings,

236
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:39,583
but you couldn't
have found anything

237
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:41,000
that pointed toward the second.

238
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:43,500
[RAMPO] The answer
was quite simple, actually.

239
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:46,541
You made use of a special
automated contraption.

240
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:49,250
You manipulated the magnetic
properties in that room

241
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:51,416
to fire the killing weapon.

242
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,125
Do you really think that such
a thing is even possible?

243
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:55,666
Anything's possible.

244
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:58,625
Especially in a world
that you yourself created.

245
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:01,833
There were hints
scattered all about.

246
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:04,833
The all too pristine
medical tools...

247
00:12:04,916 --> 00:12:06,541
Our cast of characters
wearing clothing

248
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:08,875
clearly provided to them.

249
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:14,375
I'd estimate this story
was set in the year 2050.

250
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:16,541
The mansion itself
is actually a rest stop

251
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:20,541
attached to a massive
elevator in space.

252
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:22,833
As convoluted as a
mystery novel may get,

253
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:25,708
once you figure out the
author's ulterior motives,

254
00:12:25,791 --> 00:12:28,583
you're already halfway there.

255
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:29,666
[POE]
Damn it...!

256
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:32,208
I spent six years on this...

257
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:33,583
[RAMPO]
And your intellectual devices

258
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:35,875
were much more
beautiful this time.

259
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:37,208
I just saw through them.

260
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:38,583
Hold on.

261
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:41,458
So then you do remember
your battle against me then?

262
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:42,916
[RAMPO]
There's no way I'd ever be able

263
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,791
to forget about a
mystery I cracked open.

264
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:49,666
I remember it well.

265
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,250
It was just the two of us,

266
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:53,750
pitting one mind
against the other.

267
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:54,958
It was the first time

268
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:58,291
another detective's
ability gave me chills.

269
00:12:58,375 --> 00:13:01,666
It was the last time as well.

270
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:05,458
I look forward to seeing what
you come up with for me next.

271
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:07,625
You better work
hard now, you hear me?

272
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:15,208
[POE]
I promise... I will.

273
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:20,458
[AKIKO] We'll need to hold
a celebration for you later.

274
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:22,000
[RAMPO]
What for?

275
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:24,958
[AKIKO] Our Great Detective
has finally learned the truth.

276
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:27,583
You don't actually
possess a special ability.

277
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:29,250
You simply use
your deduction to--

278
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:31,291
That's not true, I have a gift.

279
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:33,041
But you just
outsmarted Poe's trap,

280
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:35,541
and explained
everything with pure logic.

281
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:37,458
[RAMPO]
Hey I'm gifted, all right?

282
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:41,166
It wasn't anything special,
I got lucky this time is all.

283
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:42,916
It's just...

284
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,166
[AKIKO]
It's just what?

285
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:51,250
I'd look really stupid if I
turned out to be normal now...

286
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:54,833
[AKIKO laughs]

287
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:56,791
[RAMPO]
Hey! No laughing allowed!

288
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:58,458
[AKIKO]
Whatever you say.

289
00:13:58,541 --> 00:14:00,958
[RAMPO]
Don't you patronize me!

290
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:05,500
[ATSUSHI] Is it true we have
information we can use

291
00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:06,958
against the Guild?

292
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:08,125
[JUNICHIROU]
Yeah.

293
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:10,083
They're figuring out
a plan as we speak.

294
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:16,541
[OSAMU] This is some
amazing intel we've got here.

295
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:18,625
It's worth its weight in gold.

296
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:20,833
Now to figure out how
to maximize our efforts

297
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:23,791
to take out the Guild
once and for all...

298
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:25,375
Infiltrate them with a bomb?

299
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:26,791
No good.

300
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:29,291
Our comms would give us away,
and we'd be shot down.

301
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:31,750
[OSAMU]
Hmmm...

302
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:33,208
Yeah, you're right.

303
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:35,875
Well, what if we made use
of Kenji's super strength?

304
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:40,083
That would only lead to
a stalemate in a ground battle.

305
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:42,375
Yeah, I guess that's true.

306
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:43,875
How about Atsushi, then?

307
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:47,083
[RAMPO] Hmm... Paired with
Junichirou, that could work...

308
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:48,958
Excellent.

309
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:50,958
I'll get right on it.

310
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:52,625
Will we end up in the mountains?

311
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:54,000
The sea.

312
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:55,791
Roger that.

313
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,875
[LUCY]
Let go of me!

314
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:10,791
[STEINBECK] You've got a lot
of guts, betraying the Guild.

315
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:13,416
I actually admire your courage.

316
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:16,083
But did you really think that
we wouldn't have countermeasures

317
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:18,833
in place to deal
with your ability?

318
00:15:18,916 --> 00:15:21,291
[LUCY]
I course I knew that.

319
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:24,583
But I had to convince
him that I'd be all right.

320
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:27,500
Otherwise he never would
have gotten out of there.

321
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:31,541
Look, I know it's not easy
to be one of the bad guys.

322
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:33,000
Louisa!

323
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:36,875
What's our Chief Strategist
have planned for us next?

324
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:37,625
[OSAMU]
Ango!

325
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:38,791
How're you feeling?

326
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:41,458
I've come bearing
gifts and good tidings!

327
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:44,958
The Agency has agreed
to treat your injuries in-house.

328
00:15:45,041 --> 00:15:49,250
Under the care of Doctor Yosano,
you'll be as right as rain.

329
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:51,708
[ANGO]
And what do you want in return?

330
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:52,958
One of our newer recruits

331
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:55,750
was recently captured
by the military police.

332
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:57,000
We'd like to get her released

333
00:15:57,083 --> 00:15:59,500
before our final battle
with the Guild.

334
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:04,000
Ah... the girl who
killed 35 people.

335
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:06,958
I'm told she's being kept
on an unmanned plane used

336
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:09,750
to quarantine dangerous gifteds.

337
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:14,541
It would be in our power to make
a plea to grant her immunity.

338
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:19,125
But we could only fulfill
that request if this girl

339
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:21,916
is truly an Agency member.

340
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,958
Understand?

341
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:26,083
[ATSUSHI] What do you mean
Kyouka's not a member?

342
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:31,000
Well, she's not a
member yet to be exact.

343
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:32,708
There's an entrance exam
that you have to take

344
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:35,166
to make sure you're qualified.

345
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:36,666
Unless you pass the test,

346
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:40,041
you can't be officially
accepted as an employee.

347
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:43,500
You remember yours, don't you?

348
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:48,458
[ANGO]
Very well then.

349
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:50,625
I will accept your offer
of medical treatment

350
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:53,458
in exchange for my cooperation.

351
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:57,083
But only if you tell
me one thing,

352
00:16:57,166 --> 00:17:00,333
when that unidentified car
rammed into us that day,

353
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:04,458
for some reason my airbag was
the only one that didn't deploy.

354
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:08,708
Would you happen to
know anything about that?

355
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:10,458
[OSAMU chuckles]

356
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:12,958
[JUNICHIROU] The exam involves
observing the subject's behavior

357
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:15,458
to determine if they're
suitable for the Agency.

358
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:17,916
It's kept a secret
from the applicant.

359
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,041
[ATSUSHI]
Whenever Kyouka is in danger,

360
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:22,125
she looks for an
escape by hurting

361
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:24,916
or even killing the
person responsible.

362
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,208
It may just be her nature.

363
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:32,791
But if that's the case, she may
never be able to pass that exam.

364
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:34,708
[JUNICHIROU]
Okay, we're here.

365
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:38,083
Huh? A library?

366
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:44,291
[JUNICHIROU] I'm Junichirou
of the Armed Detective Agency.

367
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:46,875
[MAN]
We've been expecting you.

368
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:56,416
After you.

369
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:05,083
[JUNICHIROU] This is
our micro-assault fighter,

370
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:06,208
the Night Bird.

371
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:07,958
The plan is for me to pilot this

372
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:10,041
and deliver you
to the Moby Dick.

373
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:14,291
[ATSUSHI]
A solo infiltration?!

374
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:16,000
The Guild is in
the midst of organizing

375
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:18,083
an all-out ground assault.

376
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:21,041
You'll sneak onto the Moby Dick
while it's sparsely staffed,

377
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:23,000
and move in to take control.

378
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:26,000
Are you sure it's wise to send
me out for this mission?

379
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:27,833
[OSAMU]
For this type of job,

380
00:18:27,916 --> 00:18:30,541
a gifted with combat
experience is preferable,

381
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:34,125
due to their innate ability
to work well under pressure.

382
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:36,458
You've also been held
captive aboard this ship,

383
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:38,416
so you're familiar
with its layout.

384
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,958
Furthermore, even if you
do fail in your mission,

385
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:42,583
there's a pretty
high probability

386
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:44,583
that you'll be captured alive.

387
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:47,375
You're the most
qualified man for the job.

388
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:49,125
Will you do it?

389
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:52,333
Turn it down.

390
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:54,250
It's too much for you.

391
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:58,666
You'll be a pathetic weakling
until the day you die.

392
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:01,500
[ATSUSHI] "...I've only ever
regretted the things

393
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:03,166
that I didn't do."

394
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:09,000
I'll do it.

395
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:13,333
[RADIO] Entering visual
range of the Moby Dick.

396
00:19:13,416 --> 00:19:14,708
Understood.

397
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:16,375
You ready to go, Atsushi?

398
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:17,875
Yeah.

399
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:22,166
Special ability: Light Snow!

400
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:31,041
The sensors of the Moby Dick are
disabled for just a few seconds

401
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:34,375
while their transport
helicopter is docking.

402
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:37,541
We'll stay hidden and
close in during that time.

403
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:45,416
[TECH A] Hey, how come
the pilot isn't responding?

404
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,416
[TECH B]
Maybe they're having some

405
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,291
trouble with
their comms device.

406
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:55,125
What the...

407
00:19:55,208 --> 00:20:00,458
[AKUTAGAWA coughs]

408
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:17,833
[ATSUSHI]
Dazai, I've made it inside.

409
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:20,125
[OSAMU]
How's it look in there?

410
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:21,375
[ATSUSHI]
No one's around.

411
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:23,541
Something's wrong.

412
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:31,625
[ATSUSHI]
Where is everyone?

413
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:34,541
[MELVILLE]
They've already evacuated.

414
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:36,833
Why would this be,
you might ask?

415
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:38,041
It's because we've
already reached

416
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:41,750
the final chapter of this war.

417
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:43,125
[ATSUSHI]
Wasn't this the same man

418
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:46,875
who called down the
Moby Dick in the first place?

419
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:48,375
[MELVILLE]
The Guild's next attack

420
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:51,500
will take all their enemies
down, along with this ship.

421
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:55,208
The Moby Dick will be no more.

422
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:56,708
[ATSUSHI]
Explain yourself!

423
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:58,333
[MELVILLE] No doubt you
thought it best to attack

424
00:20:58,416 --> 00:21:01,333
while this ship was
sparsely populated.

425
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:04,041
But did you not suspect
there was something amiss

426
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:05,666
when the Guild's
main forces chose

427
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:09,125
to abandon this station now?

428
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:12,333
[STEINBECK] It would be terrible
if we became collateral.

429
00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:14,000
It's finally time
for us to advance

430
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:16,625
to the second stage
of our operation.

431
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:18,833
The Moby Dick will act
as a huge explosive,

432
00:21:18,916 --> 00:21:24,166
and annihilate Yokohama
and its accursed inhabitants.

433
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:27,125
And the area that'll
be ground zero...

434
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:30,958
...are the Agency and
Port Mafia headquarters.

435
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:35,208
[MELVILLE] This ship is set
to crash in less than an hour.

436
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:37,583
[ATSUSHI] If the Moby Dick
is your special ability,

437
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:39,833
shouldn't you be
able to stop this?!

438
00:21:39,916 --> 00:21:42,375
[MELVILLE] It's understandable
that you would believe that.

439
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:44,875
However, most of
this ship's operations

440
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:48,208
have been placed outside
of my jurisdiction.

441
00:21:48,291 --> 00:21:51,166
I no longer have
the ability to control it.

442
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:53,083
Did you catch all
of that, Dazai?

443
00:21:53,166 --> 00:21:55,958
We need to abort the operation
and retreat immediately.

444
00:21:56,041 --> 00:21:57,750
[OSAMU]
We're continuing as planned.

445
00:21:57,833 --> 00:21:59,666
[ATSUSHI]
What?!

446
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:02,125
[OSAMU] You have to take control
of the Moby Dick yourself

447
00:22:02,208 --> 00:22:04,333
and stop its descent.

448
00:22:04,416 --> 00:22:05,833
It's up to you now.

449
00:22:05,916 --> 00:22:08,625
You're the only person
who can do it.

450
00:22:09,625 --> 00:22:11,791
You predicted this would
happen, didn't you?

451
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:14,458
[OSAMU] I felt it was
a distinct possibility.

452
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:17,541
That was part of our reason for
choosing you for this mission.

453
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:25,208
[ATSUSHI] What do I need to do
to stop this ship from crashing?

454
00:22:25,291 --> 00:22:27,666
[MELVILLE] You'll have
to use the control terminal.

455
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:30,375
It's in the office
on the highest floor.

456
00:22:30,458 --> 00:22:33,583
Though you should expect
it to be well guarded.

457
00:22:33,666 --> 00:22:35,666
[FITZGERALD]
Hmm?

458
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:37,500
[ATSUSHI]
Thank you.

459
00:22:39,833 --> 00:22:41,208
[ATSUSHI]
One more thing,

460
00:22:41,291 --> 00:22:44,958
If everyone else has evacuated,
why are you still here?

461
00:22:45,041 --> 00:22:47,500
[MELVILLE] If the Moby Dick
is to fall on foreign soil

462
00:22:47,583 --> 00:22:49,500
and cause destruction,

463
00:22:49,583 --> 00:22:53,708
I figure the least I can do
is go down along with it.

464
00:22:55,416 --> 00:22:57,416
This ship was once
a beautiful creature

465
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:00,541
before its flesh
became hard and cold.

466
00:23:00,625 --> 00:23:03,666
The same could be
said of the Guild.

467
00:23:10,125 --> 00:23:11,083
[OSAMU]
What is it?

468
00:23:11,166 --> 00:23:13,541
[OUGAI]
How are you doing, Dazai?

469
00:23:13,625 --> 00:23:15,750
[OSAMU]
Hmm...

470
00:23:15,833 --> 00:23:17,208
What do you want, Mori?

471
00:23:17,291 --> 00:23:19,125
I thought we had
an understanding.

472
00:23:19,208 --> 00:23:20,916
The Mafia agreed
not to interfere

473
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,083
in our current operations.

474
00:23:23,166 --> 00:23:25,083
Funny you should mention that...

475
00:23:25,166 --> 00:23:28,541
I just received word from
one of my subordinates.

476
00:23:28,625 --> 00:23:32,041
That agreement
isn't going to hold.

477
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:37,750
[AKUTAGAWA]
Finally...

478
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:41,000
I've tracked you
down, weretiger.

479
00:23:41,083 --> 00:23:44,166
Akutagawa!

480
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:50,750
[AKUTAGAWA]
What a massive disappointment.

481
00:23:50,833 --> 00:23:52,750
I never thought you
were such a fool.

482
00:23:52,833 --> 00:23:54,458
I could kill you
a hundred times,

483
00:23:54,541 --> 00:23:57,375
and it would still feel like
I've accomplished nothing.

484
00:23:57,458 --> 00:23:58,875
[ATSUSHI]
What are you talking about?

485
00:23:58,958 --> 00:24:00,500
[AKUTAGAWA] Until I can
properly prove my worth

486
00:24:00,583 --> 00:24:03,541
on the battlefield,
that man'll never accept me.

487
00:24:03,625 --> 00:24:05,083
Damn that Dazai!

488
00:24:05,166 --> 00:24:09,875
[ATSUSHI] "That man"?
He means Dazai...?! No way!

489
00:24:09,958 --> 00:24:12,375
Next time on <i>Bungo Stray Dogs,</i>

490
00:24:12,458 --> 00:24:17,083
episode 23: "Rashoumon,
The Tiger and The Last Emperor."
