[NARRATOR]
Previously on Dragon Ball,

2
00:02:15,083 --> 00:02:18,083
the tournament semi-finals
erupted in a fist-storm

3
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:21,541
as Tien Shinhan
battled Jackie Chun.

4
00:02:28,708 --> 00:02:32,250
Tien illuminated the match
with his Solar Flare,

5
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:34,333
blindsiding Jackie.

6
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:39,041
[NARRATOR] It looked
as though Tien's

7
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:42,750
surprise attack worked, until...

8
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:45,833
Thanks.

9
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:50,291
He's up! It's miraculous,
but the fight is still on!

10
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:53,500
Tien. There's a better way.

11
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:56,666
Let me help you
unlock your true potential.

12
00:02:57,291 --> 00:03:01,083
Ka... me...

13
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:04,750
...ha... me...

14

He wouldn't!

15
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:12,958
Ha!

16
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:19,000
[NARRATOR] After the light show,
the real surprises began.

17
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:20,541
You're fighting a losing battle.

18
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:24,541
Anything you use on me,
I can send right back!

19
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:27,375
You could do with
a little humility.

20
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:30,041
I could teach you that, too.

21
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:31,958
[NARRATOR]
Despite Tien's protests,

22
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:34,666
Jackie attempted
to sway his allegiance.

23
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,125
That was somewhat encouraging.

24
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:39,583
Now let's just hope
that some of that sinks in.

25
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:41,833
[NARRATOR]
With that, Jackie Chun did

26
00:03:41,916 --> 00:03:44,625
something
completely unexpected.

Jackie Chun is out of the ring.

Jackie Chun's self-imposed
dismissal has stunned the world!

35
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:38,583
The question on everyone's mind
right now is: Why did he quit?

Where does he think he's going?

I think he's going away.

Oh, I just love to win.

was a bonus.

Why didn't he finish the fight?

I'd like to believe Master's
story about Roshi being scared.

But I know better.

62
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:24,750
There was no fear in
his eyes. He was in top form.

It doesn't make sense!

It's a first, all right.

And it could be the last
if they're not careful.

your back on Krillin?

supposed to be his friend!

than to win this tournament.
