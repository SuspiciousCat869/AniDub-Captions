1
00:02:13,708 --> 00:02:16,666
[NARRATOR] The adventure
continues as Goku and Bulma

2
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,166
have decided
to put the hunt for

3
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:20,458
the remaining
Dragon Balls on hold,

4
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:22,333
so that they can
help a lost turtle

5
00:02:22,416 --> 00:02:25,208
find its way back to the sea.

6
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:29,208
I hope we get there soon,
I'm really getting hungry!

7
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:32,541
You know, this is
probably the nicest thing

8
00:02:32,625 --> 00:02:34,541
anyone has ever done for me.

9
00:02:34,625 --> 00:02:37,166
Aw, hey.
It's no big deal really!

10
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:39,625
Well, I just
wanted to thank you.

11
00:02:39,708 --> 00:02:41,500
Gosh. I think
I'm going to cry.

12
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:42,750
Spare me, please.

13
00:02:42,833 --> 00:02:44,083
Just concentrate
on where you're going

14
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:46,416
so we can get there
while we're still young.

15
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,416
Why are you
always complaining?

16
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,750
Why don't you try thinking
happy thoughts, Bulma?!

17
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:52,125
[BULMA] Hold on.
Let's see if there's

18
00:02:52,208 --> 00:02:54,208
anything to be happy about.

19
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:55,666
Hey. Not too bad.

20
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,625
Just two more miles. Hm!

21
00:02:57,708 --> 00:03:00,125
Wow! We're close.
That's great.

22
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:01,208
Huh?

23
00:03:01,291 --> 00:03:03,833
I can't wait to
get back in the water.

24
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,083
[BEAR] Hm.

25
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:09,500
[chuckles]

26
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:13,208
Looks like dinner's on the way.

27
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:23,291
[BEAR] Hold it right there!

28
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:24,666
[BULMA screams]

29
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:25,958
[laughs]

30
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:28,416
Oh, yeah. Humans
give me heartburn

31
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,166
but I love turtles. So look.

32
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:33,000
[BEAR] Hand it
over or you're dead.

33
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:34,833
Goku! You heard him!

34
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:36,458
Give him the turtle, quick.

35
00:03:36,541 --> 00:03:37,458
Pppft!

36
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:38,541
[BULMA] Eh?!

37
00:03:38,625 --> 00:03:40,250
Huh?! Ha!

38
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:43,750
I guess a little heartburn
never hurt anybody.

39
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:46,958
All right. Have it
your way. Die if you want.

40
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:48,958
You idiot! You're going
to get us killed!

41
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:50,000
Give it to him.

42
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:53,375
I don't care
what this guy says. No.

43
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:55,625
Are you out of your
freakin' mind, kid?

44
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:57,333
[GOKU] He's my friend, Bulma.

45
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:59,583
[chuckles] Not for long.

46
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:01,541

[screams]

48
00:04:03,416 --> 00:04:04,875
[GOKU] I think
you better hop down.

49
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:07,625
--[TURTLE wails]
--[GOKU] Huh?

50
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:09,375
[grunts]

51
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:13,166
[GOKU]
It's just you and me now!

52
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:16,291
Ha-ha!
You think you're real cute.

53
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:18,666
[BEAR] Don't you, monkey boy?!

54
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:21,500
You should have
saved your skin,

55
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:23,875
[BEAR]
while you had the chance.

56
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:26,041

--[BEAR grunts]
--[GOKU laughs]

58
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,666
[GOKU] You missed me.

59
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:36,125
[GOKU] Over here, bear breath!

60
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:37,458
[BEAR] Huh?!

61
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:39,458
Forget about him, Turtle.
Let's get out of here.

62
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:40,958
[laughs]

63
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:44,708
I like you, kid.
Too bad you have to die.

64
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:46,958
[growls]

65
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:49,583
[GOKU] Yoo hoo!

66
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:52,250
[laughs]

67
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,875
[BEAR] Huh?!

68
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:57,708
[GOKU] One. Two. Three.

69
00:04:57,791 --> 00:04:58,916
[BEAR] Huh?

70
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:05,958
[groans]

71
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:07,458
[GOKU] Yay!

72
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:10,583
[GOKU] Well. That's that!

73
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:13,625
[BULMA] Yeah... sure.
Whatever you say, kid.

74
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:15,833
[GOKU] Are you okay?

75
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:18,166
Yes, I'm fine, thanks to you.

76
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,500
So some creatures think
you're good to eat, huh?

77
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:23,458
What?! Oh, my!
No, no! How disgusting.

78
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:25,541
Turtle meat is
tough and poisonous.

79
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:28,041
You'd puke.
[laughs nervously]

80
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:29,333
[GOKU] That's what I thought!

81
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:30,750
Some people will eat anything.

82
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:31,750
Not me, though.

83
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:32,875
[sighs]

84
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:34,416
[BULMA]
Ready, guys?! Let's go.

85
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,166
[GOKU] Onward to the sea.

86
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:37,541
[BULMA] Hey, wait up.

87
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:40,541
[cooing]

88
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:44,833
[BULMA] There it is, Goku.
I found it.

89
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:50,250
Huh?! No way. Wow.

90
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,750
[GOKU] Look! Look!
We're really here!

91
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:56,541
It's huge.
And blue! And beautiful!

92
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:59,458
[laughing] Whoa.

93
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:02,833
The sea!

94
00:06:02,916 --> 00:06:04,666
[BULMA]
Isn't it beautiful, Goku?!

95
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,166
[GOKU] Yeah! It's incredible.

96
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:09,250
I never dreamed that a place
like this really existed!

97
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:11,166
[TURTLE] I was starting
to wonder myself.

98
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:14,750
It's been so long.
Thanks for bringing me back.

99
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:18,958
[GOKU] Hey! Sure! No problem.
It was a lot of fun.

100
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:21,375
[TURTLE]
Well, I'd better get going.

101
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:24,333
You sure do have
a great home, Turtle!

102
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:26,791
Well, I never would have
made if it wasn't for you!

103
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:27,833
Thank you.

104
00:06:27,916 --> 00:06:29,750
[GOKU] Hey, anytime.

105
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:31,958
[TURTLE]
Would you mind waiting here?

106
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:34,083
I have a gift I'd like
to bring you to repay you

107
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:36,041
for all you've done for me.

108
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:37,291
A gift?!

109
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:39,291
What kind of gift
could a Turtle have, huh?

110
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:42,666
You'll see.
I'll be back soon! Mm, hm.

111
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:47,083
It's not a stupid shell,
is it?! Hey, hold on.

112
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:52,291
Ah... He's gone.

113
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:04,083
Hey. Watcha doing there, kid?!

114
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:06,125
I wouldn't do
that if I were you.

115
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:10,041
Ew! Yucky.
This water's salty.

116
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:14,833
[PILAF] Whoa!

117
00:07:14,916 --> 00:07:16,791
[PEOPLE] Hail, Pilaf.

118
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:18,666
Hail, the Emperor.

119
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,875
Hail, Pilaf.

120
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:26,041
[ATTENDANT]
Make way for Emperor Pilaf,

121
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:29,375
the supreme ruler of the world!

122

--[SHU] Emperor Pilaf!
--[PILAF] Huh?

[SHU] Emperor Pilaf!

126
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,333
What?! Spit it out.

127
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:38,541
Did you get the Dragon Ball?!

128
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:39,750
[SHU] Not exactly.

129
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:41,500
It's like this.
There was a slight problem

130
00:07:41,583 --> 00:07:43,166
with the information, Sire.

131
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:44,291
And?!

132
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:45,958
It was bogus. Yeah.

133
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:48,083
We were nearly killed
by a huge pack of wolves.

134
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:49,458
And then we crashed, Sire.

135
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:51,500
Some crazy kid...
he kicked our plane.

136
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:52,875
--[PILAF] Silence.
--[SHU] It was horrible.

137
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:53,958
[SHU and MAI] Aah!

138
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:55,750
I'm sick of your
lame-brained excuses!

139
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:57,583
Now get out of here
and get that Dragon Ball,

140
00:07:57,666 --> 00:08:00,125
if it's the last thing
you do! Understand?!

141
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:01,125
[SHU and MAI] Sir!

142
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:03,750
[phone ringing]

143
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:04,625
[ALL] Huh?!

144
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:06,333
[PILAF] The hotline.

145
00:08:06,416 --> 00:08:08,041
Hello?!

146
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:10,000
What's that you say?!

147
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:12,375
[PILAF] You're kidding?!
And where is it?!

148
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:14,541
I see. Well done.

149
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:16,500
Another Dragon Ball.
We're in luck.

150
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:18,083
An old hermit
named Roshi has it.

151
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:19,875
No one's even guarding it!

152
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:21,625
But... does he
have any wolves?!

153
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:22,958
[PILAF] No, you dunder-head.

154
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:24,583
He lives on an island
in the middle of the sea.

155
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:25,916
Wolves don't go there.

156
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,541
We'd better be careful.

157
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:29,416
Could be another bum-steer!

158
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,000
Never mind that!
Go get me that Dragon Ball!

159
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:33,541
[SHU and MAI] Yes, sir.

160
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,041
--[SHU] Huh?
--[MAI] Sire!

161
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:39,208
[MAI] You've never come
with us on a mission before.

162
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:40,416
You keep screwing up.

163
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,875
I can't trust you two
on your own anymore.

164
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:49,458
[aircraft noise]

165
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:51,208
[SHU] Engaging thrusters.

166
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:55,541
[SHU] Ladies and gentlemen,
this is your captain speaking.

167
00:08:55,625 --> 00:09:00,083
Please fasten your seatbelts
and remain seated at all times.

168
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:02,625
Forget the seatbelts.
It's too narrow in here.

169
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,041
Yeah, it's a
little stuffy.

170
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:05,875
That's cause there's
one too many in here.

171
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:07,208
What did you say?!

172
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:09,208
I said "I read you
loud and clear."

173
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:16,833
[BULMA] Ahh! I get so relaxed
when I'm on the beach.

174
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:19,416
[GOKU] Yeah! You're not
talking nearly as much.

175
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,166
[BULMA] Huh?
Hey, what's that?!

176
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:24,333
Whatever it is,
it's moving toward us.

177
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:25,333
[GOKU] It's the turtle!

178
00:09:25,416 --> 00:09:27,458
And he's got
someone on his back.

179
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,875
[BULMA] Wow. It's like
you've got super-vision

180
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:32,750
or something!
Pretty cool, Goku.

181
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:34,958
[GOKU]
Hey, Turtle. Over here.

182
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:36,250
[OLD MAN] Doesn't he
realize that they're

183
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:38,333
the only one's on the beach?

184
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:40,291
[TURTLE] Ahoy, there. Heh, heh.

185
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:42,833
Sorry I kept you waiting.

186
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:45,291
[TURTLE]
I had to go get my Master.

187
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:47,458
[BULMA]
Man! Check that guy out.

188
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:52,125
[sighs]

189
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:53,750
Well, hello there, kids.

190
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:56,375
[BULMA] Hi. How's it going?!
Welcome ashore.

191
00:09:57,291 --> 00:09:58,708
What a cool outfit.

192
00:09:58,791 --> 00:10:01,208
[OLD MAN] Kids, I want to thank
you for helping my turtle!

193
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:04,166
It was our pleasure, Mister.

194
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:06,166
I'm Roshi!
The turtle hermit.

195
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:08,041
Uh... A turtle hermit?

196
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:10,500
Which one of
these kids helped you?

197
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:12,708
It's that little boy, there.

198
00:10:13,416 --> 00:10:15,125
You're a very brave boy.

199
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:16,625
I have a gift
I want to give you

200
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:18,458
as a token of my gratitude.

201
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:19,958
Hear that, Goku?

202
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:29,666
Come, Magic Carpet.

203
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,375
[gasps] Magic carpet?!

204
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:33,458
[GOKU] What in the world
is a magic carpet?

205
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:35,166
[BULMA] What's a magic carpet?

206
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:38,583
It's a carpet you can sit on
and fly anywhere you want.

207
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:41,125
[BULMA]
They're not real, though.

208
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:42,916
At least,
I don't think they are.

209
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,458
[TURTLE] Hey!
Uhh, Master. Hold on.

210
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:50,250
You took the Magic
Carpet to the cleaners.

211
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:52,833
Hey, that's right. You've got
a good point there, Turtle.

212
00:10:52,916 --> 00:10:53,750
Hmm.

213
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:55,916
I knew it.
They're not real.

214
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,833
The other option
is the Flying Nimbus,

215
00:10:57,916 --> 00:11:00,875
but am I really
ready to part with it?!

216
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:03,833
Why not?! If you can
ride it, it's yours.

217
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:08,083
Come to me, Flying Nimbus!

218
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:09,833
He's odd.

219
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:12,208
He's not odd. He's nuts.

220
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:14,458
[ROSHI] Now where
is that cloud?!

221
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:22,125
[ROSHI] Oh, there it is.
It's about time. See!

222
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:25,166
[ROSHI]
She's a beauty, isn't she?!

223
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:26,291
--[BULMA] Hm?!
--[GOKU] Whoa!

224
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:28,041
[GOKU] Look, Bulma!
Isn't it neat-o?!

225
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:30,166
[BULMA]
Yeah! How strange!

226
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,250
Wow.

227
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:33,333
Don't be afraid!
She's as sweet as candy.

228
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:35,208
--[BULMA] Hm.
--[GOKU] Gosh.

229
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:38,541
[GOKU]
It's so light and puffy.

230
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:40,375
Do you mind if
I have a taste?!

231
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:42,916
You don't eat it,
you little baboon.

232
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,333
What does this thing do?!

233
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:46,166
If you can manage
to sit on this cloud

234
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:48,041
it can fly you
wherever you want.

235
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:49,375
There's got to be
some kind of hitch.

236
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:51,000
You wouldn't
be giving it away.

237
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:52,291
Something's wrong
with it, right?!

238
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:55,166
Hm?! There's nothing
wrong with this cloud.

239
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,875
Hey. Can I try to ride it now?

240
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:01,000
Sure, why not?!
But... I must warn you.

241
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:03,666
You have to be pure of
heart to ride this cloud.

242
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:04,833
[GOKU] Hm?

243
00:12:04,916 --> 00:12:06,291
Yep, otherwise it won't
let you get on it.

244
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:07,666
It's picky that way.

245
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,125
Wow.

246
00:12:09,791 --> 00:12:13,125
Here. Let an old man
show you how it's done!

247
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:14,750
[ROSHI grunts]

248
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:17,500
[laughs]

249
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:20,500
[laughs]

250
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:22,291
[TURTLE]
Are you okay, Master?!

251
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:25,666
You must have done
something naughty.

252
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,291
Be quiet.

253
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:28,958
Now let me try it.

254
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:32,708
[BOTH] Huh?!

255
00:12:32,791 --> 00:12:34,041
[GOKU] Wow.

256
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:36,208
Yeah! Alright.
I did it! I did it!

257
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:38,000
--[GOKU] I really did it!
--[TURTLE] He did it, Master.

258
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:40,666
I'll be darned.
There goes my cloud.

259
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,083
I did it! Woo hoo!

260
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:04,000
[SHU humming]

261
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:05,708
[PILAF] Shut up, Shu!
Pay attention.

262
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:07,416
[SHU] Sorry, Sire.

263
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,666
Is there any sign
of the island yet?

264
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,250
[MAI] Negative.

265
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:15,000
Hey. There it is.
Take her down.

266
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:16,541
[SHU] Right away, Sire!

267
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:17,750
[ALL] Huh?

268
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:21,666
[MAI, SHU, and PILAF scream]

269
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:35,333
[MAI] Wow. Nice house
for a turtle-hermit.

270
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:36,958
[SHU] Yeah, I wonder
if he's hiring?

271
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:39,458
You imbecile!
Let's get on with it!

272
00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:41,958
Get the Dragon Ball
and don't you dare screw up!

273
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:43,125
[SHU and MAI] Sir!

274
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:44,416
[PILAF] Now follow me.

275
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,958
[running breaths]

276
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:50,166
[laughs]

277
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:53,250
Telegram. Hello?!

278
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,666
[PILAF] Special delivery.
Telegram! Hello?!

279
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,125
Is anybody home?!

280
00:13:57,208 --> 00:13:59,291
Good. The place is empty.

281
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:00,833
[chuckles]

282
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:05,416
[SHU] I got a great idea.
Let's just break in.

283
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,250
"Break in"?!

284
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:09,250
I like your style, Shu.

285
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:11,166
But when in the presence
of a brilliant mind,

286
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,791
there is seldom need
for brute force.

287
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:16,708
Now. Where did I
put that thing?!

288
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:21,666
Oh, yeah. Here it is.

289
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:24,250
[PILAF] My Universal Key is
just the thing for this job.

290
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:26,666
We could smash
right in, but hey!

291
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,666
That's not the way I operate.

292
00:14:29,791 --> 00:14:31,833
[PILAF] There. That's it.

293
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:33,500
Hey. What's the deal?!

294
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:37,166
[grunting]

295
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:40,416
Look Emperor! This window
was open the whole time!

296
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,416
Huh?

297
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,250
I'll open the door... Wait.

298
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:46,291
Ah! Eh...

299
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:52,291
[GOKU laughing]

300
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:53,875
Yeah, whoa!

301
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:55,833
[laughs]

302
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:57,916
Wee!

303
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,583
All right! Yeah. [chuckles]

304
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:01,958
Whoa!

305
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:04,875
[laughing continues]

306
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:07,250
Whoa! Whoopie!

307
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:11,666
Whoopie!

308
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,583
Hey, down there.

309
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:15,750
Whoa!

310
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:18,416
Wow. It's great.
Thanks. I love it.

311
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,708
[ROSHI] You fly
that thing like you've

312
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:21,500
had it your whole life.

313
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:22,916
[chuckles]

314
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,458
[GOKU] See ya.

315
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:27,000
Hey, yo.
What about me?!

316
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:28,208
Hm?

317
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:30,208
Aren't you going to
give me a gift, too?!

318
00:15:30,291 --> 00:15:31,333
Whatd'ya say?!

319
00:15:31,416 --> 00:15:33,125
Did this young lady
help you as well?!

320
00:15:33,208 --> 00:15:35,125
Oh, no. Just the boy.

321
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:37,625
[BULMA] Hey! What about
the seawater I gave you?!

322
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:38,958
[ROSHI] Hmm...

323
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:40,958
I think I have to side
with Turtle on this one...

324
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:44,000
But I could be persuaded
to change my mind...

325
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:45,375
[ROSHI] For instance...

326
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:48,875
if, uh, you were to
let me see your underwear...

327
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:50,666
You wanna see my...

328
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:53,500
Master. What are you doing?!

329
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:56,000
[BULMA] You can't be serious!

330
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:58,791
Eh huh!

331
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:00,750
Have you forgotten
your code, Master.

332
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:02,541
Please. That's wrong.
Dead wrong.

333
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:04,083
Oh hush up, will ya?

334
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:06,083
Can't a master take
a break from training

335
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:07,875
and have a little fun?

336
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:11,583
Now I understand why you
couldn't ride your cloud...

337
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:13,291
Bite your tongue.

338
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:15,416
[BULMA]
This is so embarrassing...

339
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:18,416
I can't believe I'm...
doing this...

340
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:21,541
[ROSHI and TURTLE] Aah!

341
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:22,916
[yells]

342
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,291
Ta da!

343
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:27,750
[grunts]

344
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:29,875
There. Done. 
That's it.

345
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:32,500
Oh, my eyes...
I think I'm blind...

346
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:34,000
I'm gonna faint...

347
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:36,166
It serves you right!

348
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:38,958
All right.
So, where's my gift at?!

349
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:41,166
Oh, right! Sure! The gift!

350
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:44,208
Well... I have one in mind!

351
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:46,500
[ROSHI] Let's see,
I could give her the...

352
00:16:46,583 --> 00:16:48,625
No, not that,
the wheels fell off...

353
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:50,000
Well, what about the...

354
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:51,500
[BULMA] Huh?

355
00:16:54,541 --> 00:16:56,708
Nevermind. Nevermind!
I know what I want!

356
00:16:56,791 --> 00:16:59,041
Mm. Yeah? You do? What?

357
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:00,541
That! I want that!

358
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:02,750
That thing right there that's
hanging around your neck!

359
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:06,458
What? This?! You sure
you want this old thing?

360
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:09,833
I found it washed up on
my island a long time ago.

361
00:17:09,916 --> 00:17:12,541
Oh, it's beautiful...

362
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:16,541
[BULMA] The three-star ball.
I can't believe it.

363
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:17,750
[BULMA] Hey! Goku!

364
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:19,125
[GOKU] Huh?

365
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:20,541
[BULMA] Come here! I've got
something to show you.

366
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:22,333
[GOKU] Okay!

367
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:23,333
What?

368
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:25,416
Look. It's another
Dragon Ball!

369
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,083
Ah...!

370
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:28,666
It sure is, isn't it!

371
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,583
Our fourth Dragon Ball.

372
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:32,125
A Dragon...
What'd you call it?

373
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:33,583
So aren't you glad
that we decided

374
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:35,791
to help the turtle
now?! It paid off.

375
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:38,000
I sure am.
You were so right.

376
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:40,666
And now just three
more then, wish time!

377
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:41,666
[GOKU] Yeah.

378
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:44,208
What?! That thing
grants wishes?!

379
00:17:44,291 --> 00:17:45,916
[GOKU] What a great day.

380
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Thank you.
We really love our gifts.

381
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:50,166
You're a kind-hearted
and generous man.

382
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:51,750
Thanks so much.

383
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:53,916
I never said
you could have the ball.

384
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,958
[BULMA] But you said you were
going to give me a gift.

385
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:57,666
Can I have it? Please?!

386
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,416
Aw, come on.

387
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,833
There! Huh?

388
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:01,750
[laughs]

389
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:03,208
Ehhh...!

390
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:06,000
[ROSHI] I give up.
It's yours. Take it.

391
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:07,291
Yay!

392
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:09,125
[laughs]

393
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:12,541
Woo-hoo-hoo! Oh-ho!

394
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:15,208
[engine revs]

395
00:18:15,291 --> 00:18:16,416
[GOKU] Goodbye, Turtle Hermit.

396
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,833
--[BULMA] So long. 
--[GOKU] Thanks a lot.

397
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:19,375
--[BULMA] Bye, bye.
--[GOKU] See ya later.

398
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:21,333
[ROSHI] Boy! I tell ya,
these kids nowadays.

399
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:22,750
They're like little piranhas.

400
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:23,916
I was lucky
to get out of there

401
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,833
with my staff and sandals.

402
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:33,791
[tires screech]

403
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:35,666
[BULMA] Man! I never thought
things would be going this well!

404
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,875
We only need
three more Dragon Balls.

405
00:18:37,958 --> 00:18:39,500
I guess it was
meant to be, kiddo.

406
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:44,791
Ahh! Wow! I wish
Grandpa could see me now.

407
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:46,583
[BULMA screams]

408
00:18:47,708 --> 00:18:49,625
[GOKU] Hold on Bulma,
I'm coming!

409
00:18:49,708 --> 00:18:52,541
What's going on
in here? What's wrong?!

410
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:55,583
M-M-My underwear
was here on the floor...

411
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:58,208
Uh... I'm afraid to look.

412
00:19:00,958 --> 00:19:02,166
Awe...

413
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:05,125
They're not there!

414
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:07,000
[BULMA] Oh, that
means on the beach...

415
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:09,708
that old man... oh boy...

416
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:12,291
Oh, is that all?
Well that's okay, Bulma.

417
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:14,416
That's right where I put 'em!

418
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,208
What are you talking about?

419
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:19,041
After I took 'em
off this morning.

420
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:21,125
Are you saying that
you took my underwear off

421
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:23,250
while I was sleeping
this morning?! Huh?!

422
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:24,291
[GOKU] I sure did.

423
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:25,333
These underwear?!

424
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:28,125
Yep! They're the ones. Huh?

425
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:29,291
[BULMA grunting]

426
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:30,500
[GOKU] What are you
doing, Bulma?!

427
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:32,625
[BULMA yells]

428
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:34,500
[GOKU] Ow, ow! Owie! Ow!

429
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:41,750
[GAY-TOR humming]

430
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:42,666
Huh?

431
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,166
Hmm. Mm.

432
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:47,166
[MAI] This is disgusting. Ugh!

433
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:49,625
[PILAF] Darn it.
Where is that Dragon Ball?!

434
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:51,666
[SHU] It's not up here, Sire.

435
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,291
Or down here.

436
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:55,375
[MAI] It's not in the
kitchen either, Emperor.

437
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:57,541
It's possible that
someone tipped him off.

438
00:19:57,625 --> 00:19:59,500
[PILAF]
I wonder... Wait here!

439
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:02,500
[PILAF] Huh?

440
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:04,625
[exhales loudly]

441
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:06,500
[PILAF] Hey, there.
Nice day, isn't it?!

442
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:07,708
Huh?

443
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:09,208
[yells]

444
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,000
You'd better tell me
what I want to know,

445
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:13,250
or I'll make a
green handbag out of you!

446
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:14,500
Okay...

447
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:16,750
Where did this
"Roshi the Turtle Hermit" go?

448
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:18,833
Master Roshi?
He's right there, buddy.

449
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:20,083
Right where?! Aaah!

450
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:21,791
[PILAF] Shu! Mai!

451
00:20:22,916 --> 00:20:24,375
[MAI] What is it?!

452
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:25,791
[PILAF] Keep me covered.

453
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:28,625
I don't think we've met. Hi.

454
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:31,083
Hi. Now hand it over.
The Dragon Ball.

455
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:32,208
What ball?!

456
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:33,416
[SHU] Yeah!
That's right, needle-nose.

457
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,375
[MAI] You heard the man.
Now cough it up.

458
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:38,291
Dragon...? Oh, I remember.

459
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:41,166
I just gave it to that
pretty girl on the beach.

460
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:42,541
[PILAF] Are you kidding?!

461
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:44,375
[ROSHI] Seriously.
She wouldn't leave me alone

462
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:45,875
until I gave it to her.

463
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:49,125
She was nuts about that ball
because of some crazy wish.

464
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:50,333
[SHU] Huh?!

465
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:51,458
--[MAI] Huh?!
--[SHU] Doesn't sound good.

466
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:53,500
I want to know
where that girl is at.

467
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:55,708
[ROSHI] I don't know.
But I just said goodbye to her

468
00:20:55,791 --> 00:20:56,708
--[ROSHI] by the sh--shore...
--[PILAF] She couldn't have

469
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:58,833
gotten too far!
Come on! Let's go.

470
00:20:58,916 --> 00:21:00,291
[SHU and MAI] Right.

471
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:04,500
Engaging amphibious
transformation.

472
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:09,750
[PILAF]
Uh, hello there! Yoo, hoo.

473
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:11,625
Would you mind
giving us a little push?!

474
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:13,416
[ROSHI] Anything to
get you off my island,

475
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,958
you blue-faced dwarf!

476
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:16,083
[PILAF] Hurry up!

477
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:17,958
[ROSHI] Yeah, yeah!
Keep your hat on.

478
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,708
[ROSHI grunts]

479
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:23,250
Oopsie, Daisy!

480
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:24,750
[chuckles]

481
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:26,791
[ROSHI] Bon voyage.

482
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:30,958
[ROSHI] Goodbye!
Enjoy the bottom of the sea.

483
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:32,666
[PILAF] Thank you.

484
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:35,250
Those three deserve
the hole I put in their side.

485
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:38,458
Too bad.
It was a nice plane.

486
00:21:38,541 --> 00:21:41,041
[PILAF] Shu! Step on it.
We're going too slow.

487
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:42,916
[SHU] Eye, eye, skipper.

488
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:45,750
[BULMA] Ready and presto.

489
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:47,000
[GOKU yells]

490
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:48,750
[BULMA] Now that's what
I call house-cleaning.

491
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:49,916
[chuckles]

492
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,291
[GOKU] Don't scare me
like that, Bulma.

493
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:53,083
[BULMA] Okay!
I'll warn you next time.

494
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,375
I guess we'll both
take the Flying Nimbus.

495
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:57,708
It'll be faster.

496
00:21:57,791 --> 00:21:59,375
[GOKU] But didn't Master Roshi
say you have to be

497
00:21:59,458 --> 00:22:01,458
pure of heart to ride
the Flying Nimbus?

498
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:02,750
What's that supposed to mean?!

499
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:05,500
I'm probably the
purest person you know.

500
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:07,625
[GOKU] All right.

501
00:22:07,708 --> 00:22:09,125
[GOKU] Go ahead!
Give it a try.

502
00:22:09,208 --> 00:22:11,041
[BULMA] Uh...! Uh!

503
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:14,083
Pure, huh?! [chuckles]

504
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,458
Ooh! Now my
clothes are dirty.

505
00:22:16,541 --> 00:22:20,166
Darn it. I didn't want to
ride that stupid cloud anyway.

506
00:22:27,041 --> 00:22:28,000
[GOKU] Kind of slow, huh?!

507
00:22:28,083 --> 00:22:29,250
[BULMA] Oh, just hush up.

508
00:22:29,333 --> 00:22:31,541
Nobody likes
a show-off, you know.

509
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:34,291
[SHU]
There's that smell again...

510
00:22:34,375 --> 00:22:35,625
[MAI] Man! That's toxic.

511
00:22:35,708 --> 00:22:37,833
[PILAF] Oh, yeah. Well,
whoever smelt it dealt it.

512
00:22:37,916 --> 00:22:38,875
Right, Shu?!

513
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:40,291
[SHU] Yes, Sire.

514
00:22:40,375 --> 00:22:41,708
Huh?!

515
00:22:41,791 --> 00:22:43,833
[NARRATOR] As the villains
sink with the setting sun,

516
00:22:43,916 --> 00:22:45,875
our heroes'
adventure continues.

517
00:22:45,958 --> 00:22:48,208
Join us again
next time as Goku and Bulma

518
00:22:48,291 --> 00:22:49,666
once again
further their quest

519
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:52,666
to unite the seven
magic Dragon Balls.
