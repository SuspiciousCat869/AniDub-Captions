[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball...

2
00:02:13,541 --> 00:02:17,166
Fortuneteller Baba told Goku
and ChiChi of a magical furnace

3
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:19,375
that could extinguish
the mysterious flames

4
00:02:19,458 --> 00:02:21,458
surrounding the
Ox King's castle.

5
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:24,166
Desperate, the brave pair
set out on their new quest,

6
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:27,375
which led them to the
treacherous Mount Five Elements.

7
00:02:27,458 --> 00:02:29,708
After navigating their way
through perilous terrain

8
00:02:29,791 --> 00:02:32,583
and lethal obstacles,
Goku and his fianceé

9
00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:36,750
finally locate the magical
furnace and much more.

10
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:40,166
[GOKU]
I... guess we found it.

11
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:46,666
[NARRATOR]
Goku was shocked to find

12
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:49,208
his deceased grandfather, Gohan.

13
00:02:49,291 --> 00:02:51,583
The young hero's
surprise turned to dismay

14
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:54,250
upon learning Gohan
now served the caretaker

15
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:55,583
of the magical furnace.

16
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:57,541
Despite their urgent pleas,

17
00:02:57,625 --> 00:03:01,333
Annin was unwilling to
shut down the raging furnace.

18
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:03,833
[ANNIN] In theory, if the
magical fire were extinguished,

19
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:07,083
the plains of existence would
be thrown into utter chaos.

20
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:10,458
Actually, it sounds like fun.

21
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:11,666
Annin, please!

22
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,500
You must help.

23
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:14,500
Grandpa!

24
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:16,250
[GOHAN grunts]
Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

25
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:20,708
I'm sorry. The flames cannot
be put out, for you, or anyone.

26
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:24,250
Now, think about it.

27
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:26,125
You wouldn't want
to be responsible

28
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:30,375
for the world's greatest
disaster, would you?

29
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:34,125
[NARRATOR]
And now, the conclusion.

30
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:19,625

Do your worst flames!
Rise as high as you wish.

33
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:32,333
I will not meet defeat
before I see my daughter

34
00:04:32,416 --> 00:04:33,416
in her wedding dress!

35
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,750
I will keep it safe...
no matter what!

36
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:50,666
[GOKU] You can't ignore this.
Unless the fire is put out,

37
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,500
it will destroy the Ox King!

38
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:56,916
[CHICHI] I beg you!
Please save my father.

39
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,083
[GOHAN]
Hmm.

40
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:00,458
Annin?

41
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:03,583
Gohan, please...think
about what you're asking.

42
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:06,291
You would have me
sacrifice this entire world

43
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:08,041
to save but one life?

44
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:11,541
I guess I'm just not as
ready to give up yet!

45
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:14,583
[GOHAN] Goku, that's enough!
Watch your mouth!

46
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:17,375
[ANNIN]
Mhm... mhm.

47
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:21,166
Fine, I'll do it myself! Now
tell me how to put out the fire!

48
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:27,500
These noodles are delicious.
Here, try some.

49
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:29,125
I'm not hungry!

[GOHAN]
Goku, that was extremely rude!

53
00:05:38,916 --> 00:05:40,625
Annin, he begs for
your forgiveness.

54
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:42,625
I'm so sorry.

55
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:46,541
ChiChi, you don't have
to apologize.

What was that for?!

58
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:55,708
Goku, stop!

59
00:05:55,791 --> 00:05:58,416
Your gums are showing.
Are you this rude to everyone,

60
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,625
or just to the people from
whom you're seeking help?

61
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:02,958
If you wanna put
out the fire so badly,

62
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:05,791
I suggest you turn
that handle over there.

63
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:08,708
Turn to the right.

No, I won't let you do this!

If the flames go out,
something terrible will happen!

I have to do this, Grandpa!

you're doing!

[CHICHI]
Are you all right?

84
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:58,833
Nice trip? Did you get
a good look at the steam

85
00:06:58,916 --> 00:07:00,416
coming up from the furnace?

86
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,458
Yeah.

87
00:07:01,541 --> 00:07:03,708
That steam turns into fog,

88
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:06,166
which covers the top of
Mt. Five Elements.

89
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:09,791
That fog is what I believe
to be the problem.

90
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:11,208
Uh? Fog?

91
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:13,958
That's right, dear. Fire
makes steam, steam becomes fog.

92
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:16,625
Take away the fire,
and surprise, no more fog.

93
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:19,708
What's so... bad about that?

94
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:20,958
Calm down and listen.

95
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:23,416
The fog is the only way
in and out of the path

96
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,916
that runs between
this world and the next.

97
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,833
When a person's life is over,
they pass into the Other World.

98
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:33,166
However, on the date
of their passing,

99
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:37,250
or during a special festival,
they can return to this world

100
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:39,000
and meet their descendants.

101
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:42,750
This journey can only take
place through the fog.

102
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:46,958
Without it, the gateway
would be sealed forever.

103
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:52,000
Losing the fog would not
only inhibit spirits

104
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:54,833
from traveling to this world,
but those that are already here

105
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:57,583
would be trapped
for all eternity.

106
00:07:57,666 --> 00:08:00,000
That would include
the evil ones.

107
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:03,208
Eventually, the dark spirits
would overrun the Earth

108
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:06,041
and destroy everything.

109
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:12,875
[ANNIN]
This is not just a theory.

110
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:15,083
It will come to pass...

111
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:18,375
...should I allow you
to turn off the furnace.

112
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:21,333
What if the furnace were only
turned off for a short time?

113
00:08:21,416 --> 00:08:24,375
Long enough to put out the
fire around my father's castle,

114
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:27,666
but without dissipating
the fog completely?

115
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,791
Won't work.

116
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:31,541
What do you mean?

117
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:34,916
Because, if the magical
fire goes out just once,

118
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,166
it would take 200
years to re-ignite.

119
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:42,166
In the meantime, this world
would grow cold and dark.

120
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:45,000
Evil would take hold,
and I can promise you,

121
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:48,166
it won't give up its
stranglehold for tender mercy!

00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:55,416
that threatens my father?

125

What is it?

The bottom of the

of the octagon-shaped eggshells
from the fire-eater bird.

Fire-eater bird?

Not only do we need egg
shells to fill in the hole,

but we need honey
from bees that live

The chance that our

00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:56,208
is slim to say the least.

I do not plan on failing.

The only thing that is certain,

is if you fail, you will die.

225

Goku, in ten thousand years

226
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:11,500
I've never met as brave
a heart as yours.

227
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:13,500
Very well.
I will lift the pot,

228
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:16,083
while you go into the
furnace and fill the hole.

229
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:18,208
[GOKU]
Okay, let's do it.

230
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:20,916
[GOHAN]
Annin, I beg you to reconsider.

231
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,333
You know as well as I
that inside the furnace

232
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:26,500
is the sea of fire. Not even
Goku could survive in there.

233
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:28,958
This plan is folly.

234
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:31,750
But your grandson
has the Bansho Fan.

235
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:34,166
[GOHAN]
I understand.

236
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:39,041
Listen. You have a chance,
but the danger is immeasurable.

237
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:42,833
From over the furnace,
you must wave the fan once.

238
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:45,541
This will part the flames
and create a path.

239
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:48,166
Follow along this path
until you reach the hole,

240
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:51,708
fill it in, and get out. The
time allowed for all of this is

241
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:54,166
as short as the
blink of an eye.

242
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:58,416
Goku, the rest of your
life hinges on this moment.

243

I will succeed.

244

It's as large as a
mountain on the inside.

to this task? Are you ready?

the furnace is not exaggerated.

even more ancient than I am.

have eroded more than one hole,
