Previously on Dragon Ball...

00:02:17,291 --> 00:02:20,041
Krillin fought a vicious

3
00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:22,208
for the last Dragon Ball began.

4
00:02:22,291 --> 00:02:24,541
It was the first of a
five-match tournament,

5
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:27,125
pitting Goku's team
against the spooky forces

6
00:02:27,208 --> 00:02:28,916
of Fortuneteller Baba...

7
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,833
Together, Puar and Upa
turned Krillin's defeat

8
00:02:31,916 --> 00:02:35,125
into triumph as they out-foxed
their toothy challenger

Yamcha was ambushed

00:02:51,208 --> 00:02:52,708
by an invisible man.

14
00:02:52,791 --> 00:02:56,041
The situation looked bleak
until Krillin exposed

15
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:59,666
the sneaky fighter with
some trickery of his own!

a second victory for his team,

00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:12,833
but the revelry was
short-lived as the fighters

19
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:15,916
moved to a more dangerous
venue for the third match...

20
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,166
The Devil's Toilet.

Yamcha's risking his life!

your sister,

31
00:04:21,916 --> 00:04:24,375
[BABA] I trust you will find
this new venue a challenge

32
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:27,333
worthy of your skill.
The tongues are your boundary.

33
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:29,000
The rest of the rules
are the same.

the stakes are higher...

Your fear is understandable.

47

[YAMCHA] Lady, I've never
quit anything in my life

48

That's the spirit.

this guy's more about

If I can keep moving
and strike fast,

Although...

324
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:15,750
With Goku's recent
increase in power,

325
00:22:15,833 --> 00:22:20,083
perhaps he does possess
the strength... I hope.

326
00:22:20,166 --> 00:22:22,625
Ready? You may begin.

327
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:25,333
[BANDAGES cackles]

328
00:22:25,416 --> 00:22:27,666
For someone who's so mean...

329
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:31,333
you sure do like to
laugh a whole lot.

330
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:36,333
[BANDAGES cackling]

331
00:22:36,416 --> 00:22:38,916
[NARRATOR] Goku is the
last defender on his team.

332
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,166
If he loses this match,
the location

333
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:42,791
of the last Dragon Ball,

334
00:22:42,875 --> 00:22:46,208
and Upa's father,
may be lost forever.

335
00:22:46,291 --> 00:22:48,083
But how can he win
against an opponent

336
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:50,041
who has never been defeated?

337
00:22:50,125 --> 00:22:51,916
The answer lies
ahead on the next

338
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,875
spectacular episode
of Dragon Ball!
