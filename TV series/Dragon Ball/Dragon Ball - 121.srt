00:02:11,958 --> 00:02:14,083
[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball...

2
00:02:14,166 --> 00:02:15,583
[PICCOLO]
Now watch and learn...

3
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:20,208
You're about to see for yourself
how powerful I really am!

4
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:23,791
Come on! I'm ready
anytime you are!

5
00:02:23,875 --> 00:02:26,416
[NARRATOR] Piccolo was
furious that Goku dared

6
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,208
to challenge him, so he
pulled out all the stops

7
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:32,041
and tried to clobber his
pint-sized opponent.

8
00:02:32,125 --> 00:02:38,333
But the wily young hero proved
to be more than a handful.

9
00:02:38,416 --> 00:02:42,166
Unfortunately, a well placed
punch sent Goku flying,

10
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:44,791
and it looked like
this battle was over

11
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:47,125
before it could
ever get started.

12
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:51,333
[NARRATOR]
With his competition crushed,

13
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:54,333
Piccolo now has free reign
over Eastern City

14
00:02:54,416 --> 00:02:57,166
and that's got everyone
afraid for their lives.

15
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:01,250
[PICCOLO] Ha, ha. That's it!
He's gone! Ha, ha.

16
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:03,458
Good riddance, kid!

17
00:03:03,541 --> 00:03:05,750
[NARRATOR]
Is Goku really gone?

18
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:08,333
Or is there a chance that
some miracle will happen

19
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:10,166
and he'll be able
to pull himself up

20
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:14,208
and face Piccolo one
more time? Stay tuned!

[PICCOLO chuckling]

23
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55,166
If he was their best,
then I stand alone

24
00:03:55,250 --> 00:04:00,166
as the most powerful
force on Earth! [laughs]

25
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:02,833
No, I can't let it end this way!

[GOKU]
Ha... Me...

32
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:26,958

won't work on me!

the Kamehameha!

Hey! I couldn't have hurt you
that much! On your feet.

I'm just getting warmed up!

What are you, a monster?!

47

The only monster here is you!

48

only one of us is left standing.

this time! [laughs]

more powerful than before!

Hang on! We'll be at the King's
castle in about ten minutes.

64
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:39,708
Do you think Tien could
hold out this long, Yamcha?

65
00:07:39,791 --> 00:07:42,333
He must be okay. I haven't
heard any news about him

66
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:45,041
from West City, but if
there's any trouble

67
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:47,958
when we get there, I'm
joining in on the fight!

Uh. Have you gone bananas?

You know how tough Tien is!
How are you gonna help?

No, I'm not hungry.

[NEWSCASTER] Now a special
news bulletin from West City!

75
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:07,291
At this very moment, the
monster called Piccolo

76
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:10,625
is battling near
the King's castle!

77
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:13,333
Good! Piccolo is still there!

78
00:08:13,416 --> 00:08:17,458
[BULMA] Uh. So, maybe we
should turn back now?

Now is a good time to go!

[KING]
I refuse to leave the castle!

88
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:06,083
But sir, something terrible
could happen to you!

89
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:09,000
You're in great danger
if you stay here!

90
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:11,458
I can't leave...

91
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:13,000
Listen to me.

92
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:15,125
The best thing for you to do
is leave the city immediately

93
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:16,333
and come back when it's safe.

94
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:18,958
This is the only
choice we have, sir!

95

Please, sir.

Very well...

97
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:38,166
But what about all
those people out there?

98
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:41,458
I can't just leave them behind.

99
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:45,000
I wish there was something
I could do about this.

Goku has the advantage!
Piccolo can be defeated!

105
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,750
[NEWSCASTER] It looks as
though two unidentified people

106
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:34,916
have surrounded Piccolo, and
at this time, there appears

107
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,291
to be an intense battle going
on inside the King's castle.

108
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:40,166
Two?

109
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:41,875
Did he say there
are two people?

110
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:43,958
I thought Tien was the
only one down there.

111

[NEWSCASTER] Here's a picture
taken by telephoto lens

112
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:48,625
of what's happening inside
the castle grounds.

113
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:50,625
We can't get any closer because
it would be too dangerous

114
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:53,375
for our camera crew. However,
I have some new information

115
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:55,791
on the two unidentified people.

116
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:58,625
One appears to be a young
man, a very bald young man.

117
00:10:58,708 --> 00:10:59,916
And the other is a small boy.

information we can provide at

What is that?

The attack might not be as
powerful as the last one,

214
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:27,583
but that doesn't matter,
because it'll be strong enough

to destroy a little
brat like you!

You should've given
up a long time ago.
