being attacked.

We were!
By the evil InoShikaCho!

00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:01,125
It could destroy

out there guiding him?

Hmph. No. My job is to teach,
and theirs is to sweat.

Well, by the looks of it,
you'll soon be unemployed.

That's Crane and me
when we were young.

Your friend's a

you're looking for is "unique!"

InoShikaCho was a rare,

for a better friend...

As he grew, so did his temper.

It's scary how fast
cute becomes dangerous.

big bundle of joy now?

Not a bad price
when you consider

107
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:26,791
we were risking our lives.

108
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:28,875

if you would stay the night

In exchange,
take whatever you need.

We could use this food.

I'm surprised you can speak.

I don't know their names, but
I saw them with InoShikaCho.

They were all eating

I'd heard he was destroyed!

He's alive.

Those guys who were supposed
to hunt him are his friends!

If they were all friends...

326
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:18,458
There you go, Ino,
you're all done.

327
00:21:18,541 --> 00:21:21,000
The medicine I applied will help
your wound heal much faster.

328
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:23,125
You'll be up and running
in no time.

329
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:25,000
See, I told you she was good!

330
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:27,125
[grunts happily]

331
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:29,208
Y'know, I still wish we
could have found out

332
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:30,958
who those two guys were.

333
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:32,500
I overheard them talking about

334
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,750
the World Martial
Arts Tournament.

335
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:36,208
Really?!

336
00:21:36,291 --> 00:21:38,625
I'm in training right now to
compete in the tournament.

337
00:21:38,708 --> 00:21:40,041
That's great!

338
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:42,375
With your strength, you should
have no problem winning!

339
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:44,541
There are a lot of people
tougher than me.

340
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:46,041
That's why
I'm out here training.

341
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:47,791
The more I fight,
the stronger I'll get.

342
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:49,125
[INOSHIKACHO growls]

343
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:54,208
Ino! What are you doing?!
He saved your life!

344
00:21:54,291 --> 00:21:56,125
[GOKU] Oh, I get it now...

345
00:21:56,208 --> 00:21:57,458
Hmm...

346
00:21:57,541 --> 00:22:00,041
I think this is his way
of saying "Thank You."

347
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:02,833
He wants to fight me
so he can help my training.

348
00:22:02,916 --> 00:22:04,375
[grunts]

349
00:22:04,458 --> 00:22:05,833
Great!

350
00:22:05,916 --> 00:22:07,333
Show me what you got!

351
00:22:07,416 --> 00:22:10,625
[grunts]

352
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:16,416
[NARRATOR] As Goku fights
his latest training match,

353
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,125
he realizes he has more than

354
00:22:18,208 --> 00:22:20,958
just a challenging sparring
partner in InoShikaCho;

355
00:22:21,041 --> 00:22:24,958
he also has a
valuable ally and friend.

356
00:22:25,041 --> 00:22:27,875
However, there are still many
unanswered questions

357
00:22:27,958 --> 00:22:31,333
for our hero, including the
identity of the mysterious duo

358
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:34,666
and their connection to the
World Martial Arts Tournament.

359
00:22:37,583 --> 00:22:39,708
[NARRATOR] As Goku heads
out on yet another leg

360
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:43,000
of his training journey, he
leaves behind a happy community

361
00:22:43,083 --> 00:22:45,458
and its new-found... "helper."

362
00:22:45,541 --> 00:22:48,708
Yes, it's been a successful end
to an exciting day for Goku,

363
00:22:48,791 --> 00:22:50,375
with many more to come.

364
00:22:50,458 --> 00:22:51,541
Join us next time,

365
00:22:51,625 --> 00:22:54,916
as the adventure continues
on Dragon Ball!
