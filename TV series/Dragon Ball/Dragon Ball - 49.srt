00:02:12,625 --> 00:02:14,708
[NARRATOR]
Last time on DragonBall...

2
00:02:14,791 --> 00:02:17,000
[BULMA]
Faster! We've gotta go faster!

3
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:18,250
[KRILLIN] I'm going!

4
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:20,666
[BULMA] Would it help
if I got out and pushed?

5
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,916
They're firing at us again!

6
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,541
Okay, now would be
a good time to move!

7
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:27,083
[NARRATOR] The Red Ribbon Army
made their presence felt,

8
00:02:27,166 --> 00:02:30,625
as they turned up the heat
on Goku, Bulma, and Krillin.

9
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:34,083
General Blue lead the attack,
which included sending troops

10
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:36,750
to Roshi's Island
to kidnap the master

11
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:40,500
and steal the two
Dragon Balls in his possession.

12
00:02:40,583 --> 00:02:43,458
Goku and his friends
found safety in a cave

13
00:02:43,541 --> 00:02:46,458
too narrow for the
large submarine to follow.

14
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:49,500
However, the resourceful
general was prepared

15
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:51,958
and continued the chase
in smaller vessels.

16
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:53,125
Hurry up, guys!

17
00:02:53,208 --> 00:02:55,708
And whatever you do,
don't look back!

18
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:20,583
Oh my gosh!
They're still after us!

19
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:23,333
Only now they have two ships,
and they don't look happy!

20
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:24,833
Are you trying
to get us killed?!

21
00:03:24,916 --> 00:03:27,958
Trust me, I don't
want to meet them either.

22
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,833
Did I mention
that they have torpedoes?

23
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:32,791
What are torpedoes?

24
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:34,916
Haven't you been
paying attention?

25
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,625
They're bombs!
They blow things up!

26
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:39,083
Oh, okay. So that's a torpedo!

27
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:41,916
It must be nice to live
in complete oblivion.

28
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,791
Which is about
what we're gonna be!

29
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:45,000
I'm trying!

30
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:46,208
I've got them in range, sir.

31
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:47,500
Shall we launch torpedoes?

32
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:49,833
Negative. We'd risk a cave-in.

33
00:03:49,916 --> 00:03:53,500
Besides, you don't need to use
a torpedo to destroy a fly.

34
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:55,833
There's an easier solution.

35
00:03:55,916 --> 00:03:58,250
Ram them into the cave wall!

36
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:10,291
[STAFF OFFICER] General Blue's
Company A is in pursuit

37
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:13,541
of the little boy
and the third Dragon Ball.

38
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:15,625
Captain Dock
is supervising the raid

39
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:17,291
on the island by Company B.

40
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:20,041
Our radar has a confirmed
lock on two Dragon Balls

41
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:22,291
[STAFF OFFICER] located within
the scientist's compound.

42
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:24,291
As you know, the old man
is accompanied by

43
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:26,333
a woman and a turtle,
which are believed to be

44
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:27,958
his only protection.

45
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:31,416
Yes, yes. General Blue
is a brilliant tactician.

46
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,833
I'm supposedly surrounded
by the best minds

47
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:35,875
[RED]
of every conceivable industry.

48
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:38,875
Yet I'm still chasing a child
for what should have been

49
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:40,583
in my possession months ago!

50
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:42,416
I understand, sir.

51
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,958
You understand nothing!

52
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:46,041
But make sure General Blue does.

53
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:48,333
I want that scientist
brought back to me alive,

54
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:50,833
at all costs...!

55
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:53,166
He is the key to our success.

56
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:56,708
Consider it done, sir.

57

59
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:04,125
[ROSHI] A beautiful day,

60
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:06,416
a beautiful girl
cooking me breakfast,

61
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,625
what more could
a hermit ask for?

62
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:10,583
Now if I could just
get some results from

63
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:12,833
this shrinking
contraption of Bulma's.

64
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:14,750
So far, the answer to my dreams

65
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:17,541
has given me
nothing but nightmares!

66
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:19,458
I've been flushed
down the toilet

67
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:21,666
and sucked up
by a vacuum cleaner!

68
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,708
Getting a bird's-eye view
of dust-bunnies

69
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:27,041
wasn't exactly
what I had in mind.

70
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:29,250
Well I've never
given up on anything

71
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:31,666
and I'm not about to start now!

00:05:43,708 --> 00:05:45,708
[LAUNCH] Ah, a hot bath!

75
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:53,708

[ROSHI] Aah! Not attractive.
Control Roshi, control.

00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:10,333
Hey there, Launch!

80
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:11,541
Huh?

81
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:13,833
You've been working
so hard this morning.

82
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:15,875
Awe. Don't be silly.

83
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:19,833
I took the liberty of
drawing you a nice, hot bath.

84
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:23,000
Thanks, but I
have to finish cooking.

85
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:24,250
Cooking...?!

86
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:26,625
Nonsense, what you
need is a bath.

87
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:28,416
Here, I'll take care
of those eggs.

88
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,791
I-I'd rather--

89
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:31,166
[ROSHI] Hand it over!

90
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:34,875
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ahhhchoo!

91
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:36,333
[TURTLE] Aah...

92
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:42,250
Haaa! What are you
looking at, old-timer?!

[yells, groans]

00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,750
[LAUNCH] Not so fast.

95
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:48,208
Mercy!

96
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:50,708
[LAUNCH] Who are you and
what do you think you're doing

97
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:52,125
here in my house?!

98
00:06:52,208 --> 00:06:54,166
Speak up! I don't have all day!

99
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:55,875
What?! This is my house!

100
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:59,041
You're welcome to stay,
but I'm feelin' kinda sick.

101
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:02,291
[coughing]

102
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:03,333
See ya!

103
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:06,583
Hold it right there!
I'm on to you!

104
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:09,708
[ROSHI] It was all
innocent fun. Really! Heh.

105
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:11,250
What are you
talking about, old fool?

106
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:13,500
Stop your blabbering
and answer my question!

107
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:16,208
Now, are we roommates or not?

108
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:19,250
Huh? The two of us? Roommates?

109
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:21,125
Why... yes, we are.

110
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:22,875
Have I lived here long?

111
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:24,291
Long enough to call it home.

112
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:26,375
You like the salty air
and the warm climate

113
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:28,958
and you especially like those
soothing massages I give you.

114
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:30,166
Uh, daily!

115
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,708
A massage? Why would
I let anyone near me,

116
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:34,875
much less give me a massage?!

117
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:37,125
Launch, baby, you love 'em!

118
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:39,333
That's plausible I guess.

119
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:40,916
But why would you
go out of your way?

120
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,875
What do you get out of it?

121
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:45,083
Hey, that's what
friends are for.

122

[ROSHI laughing]
[LAUNCH chuckles]

123
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:49,583
Actually...
a massage sounds nice.

124
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:52,000
My shoulders
have been a bit stiff.

125
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:52,916
Ooh?!

126
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,708
But I'm warning you, Buster!

127
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:57,833
If you try any funny business,
I'll knock your block clean off!

128
00:07:57,916 --> 00:08:00,416
[ROSHI] No! Of course not!
Perish the thought!

129
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,791
All right. Pay extra
attention to my upper back.

130
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:04,291
It's really sore.

131
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:08,041
[ROSHI] Roshi, you devil!
You still got it!

132
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:11,541
I'll have her eating from
the palm of my hand in no time!

[chuckles]

134
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:17,041
Okay, looks like the back
is in good shape.

Hm!

By the sound of it,

00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:45,208
I'd say my master is
up to his old tricks again.

147
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:54,750
Captain, we have
an ETA of five minutes.

All right men, listen up.

The circus is
coming into town in five!

00:08:57,791 --> 00:08:58,791
You know the drill.

151
00:08:58,875 --> 00:09:00,375
I want this one
strictly by the book.

152
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:03,208
[DOCK] Tonight is hoagie night
and we're not going to miss it!

I'm wasting away over here!

Eh, oh, oh, hot, ah, eh, hot!

00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:20,833
Bon appétit!

158
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:23,916
Huh. Looks interesting.
What do you call it?

159
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,833
[ROSHI] Oh...
It's an old family recipe.

160
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:29,666
I call it dah-wha-la...

00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,166
Well, then you've had
a long time to get it right.

163
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:36,708
Uuuh... Eeeh...

164
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:38,458
[LAUNCH] Bleh! Ugh!

165
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:40,208
[growls]

166
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:41,875
Does it need more salt?

167
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:44,125
You're the chef. You tell me.

168
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:45,666
Okay.

169
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:48,666
[yells]

170
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,208
What are you trying to do,
poison me?

171
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:51,625
You call that slop food?!

172
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:54,375
In case I forgot to mention it,
I'm allergic to garbage!

173
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:57,250
Give me another chance!
I make a mean soufflé!

174
00:09:57,333 --> 00:10:01,666
[LAUNCH] Quiet! Something stinks
here and it's not the food!

175
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,500
I'll give you another massage!

176
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:05,916
You've given enough!
Now it's my turn.

177
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:13,208
[LAUNCH] Uh, uhhh, ahhh...

178
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:14,500
[sighs]

179
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:18,166
Ah! Ah! Ahhh! Ahhh...!

180
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,208
[LAUNCH] Aaahchoo!

181
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,708
[ROSHI and TURTLE sigh]

182
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:28,041
Roshi? What's wrong?
You look beat.

183
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:32,916
You certainly have a way
with the ladies, Master.

184
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,416
Well, I guess everyone
has their talents.

185
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,833
[chuckles nervously]

186
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:38,291
[BOTH] Huh?

187
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:46,125
Wow!

188
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:48,875
Are you expecting
any visitors today?

189
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:51,291
Nope. I don't know 'em.

190
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,791
[beep]

191
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:58,750
[chuckles]

192
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:06,500
I have them on screen
and in range, Captain.

193
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,458
Roger. Proceed with caution.

194
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:10,333
They may be up to something.

195
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:11,791
Roger.

196
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:16,125
Look's like
we have a lot of guests.

197
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:18,750
Good thing I made
plenty of soup.

198
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:40,125
[whimpers]

199
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:43,333
[chuckles]

200
00:12:03,666 --> 00:12:07,166
Ensign, check the house.

201
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:10,083
Who are you? I paid my taxes.

202
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:11,625
[grunts]

203
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:15,250
Congratulations, Doctor.
You're just been recruited

204
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:17,541
by the Red Ribbon Army.

205
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:20,625
Doctor? That's a new one.

206
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:22,041
[laughs]

207
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:25,166
Don't play games...
We know who you are.

208
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:27,291
I wish I could say the same.

209
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:30,250
Uh. I, uh... I've never
had so many guests

210
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:33,000
on my island
with so much ammunition.

211
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:36,458
The Red Ribbon Army
is well supplied.

212
00:12:36,541 --> 00:12:38,250
The Red Ribbon Army...?

213
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:40,958
Oh... I have
heard of you before.

214
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:45,541
We found the girl.
She was alone inside the house.

215
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:48,250
There doesn't appear to be any
booby-traps on the property.

216
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:49,750
Good.

217
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:51,291
You'll have to forgive me.

218
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:54,208
It took a moment to register
the title of your organization.

219
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:56,208
I've heard it called
so many different names.

220
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:59,708
You have a real reputation
for being cruel and unjust.

221
00:12:59,791 --> 00:13:01,083
What?!

222
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:03,958
There's a ton. Like the
jerk patrol, the dirt-bags,

223
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:06,916
and my personal favorite,
the Red Ribbon Slime Balls.

224
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,750
Heh. That's nice...
In case you haven't noticed,

225
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:12,166
these dirt-bags,
as you call them,

226
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,208
have you out-numbered
and out-gunned.

227
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:15,583
Yup... And out-whipped.

228
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:17,750
That must come in handy
on training day.

229
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:19,541
It's not for my men...

230
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:21,250
It's for those
who oppose me, Doctor.

231
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:23,833
Now, let's dispense
with the pleasantries.

232
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:25,291
[DOCK] You will soon learn
that I am not a man

233
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,500
with whom to toy.

234
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:28,583
Hand over your
Dragon Balls immediately.

235
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:30,166
Yes, we know you have them.

236
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:32,625
Do it! Or suffer my wrath!

237
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:35,541
Uuh...

238
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:37,000
I guess he needs more practice.

239
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:38,958
Say, I didn't know
you had any Dragon Balls.

240
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:40,458
Maybe he's confused.

241
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:41,916
[DOCK] Silence!

242
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:45,708
[DOCK] There are three things
I want from you, Doctor!

243
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:48,166
The two Dragon Balls the kid
left in your possession,

244
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:51,291
which you undoubtedly have
hidden somewhere on this island,

245
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:53,375
[DOCK] and a radar to
track down the other balls,

246
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:56,666
like the one you made
for that little brat!

247
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:59,666
You think he left
Dragon Balls here?

248
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:02,291
Oh... The bag...
He left one behind.

249
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:04,833
Maybe... that's where they are.

250
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:06,958
Well, we'll soon find out!

251
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:09,916
Tear the house apart!
I want those Dragon Balls!

252
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,208
And I can see why.

253
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:14,291
You're obviously lacking
in the ball department.

254
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:16,791
That's it! I'm sick of
your mouth, old man!

255
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:19,625
Just remember,
you asked for this!

256

[DOCK grunting]

257
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:28,250
Hey...!
Felt the wind on that one!

258
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:30,833
[SOLDIER A] Captain,
he's just an ornery old man.

259
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:32,875
He can't fight anybody.

260
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:34,833
He probably can't even
walk without his cane.

261
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:37,000
That's true, Scout.

262
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:39,500
Whatever helps you
sleep at night, slick.

263
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:42,458
Next time I may not
be able to hold myself back.

264

[ROSHI groans]

265
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:48,125
Heh. I understand.
That's a lot to restrain.

266
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:49,958
Bring it on, gramps!

[SOLDIER B] Hold it, old man!

[SOLDIER B] Take another step
and she's history!

277
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:33,750
All right...
Settle down now...

278
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:35,916
Put the gun away.

I'm the one who's
giving orders here, not you!

I'm watching you, man!
Don't try anything funny!

Hey! Watch it, sweetheart.

You don't want to
break my concentration.

290
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:01,083
I'll break
a lot more than that.

to join your friends?

Lets get out of here!

323
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,041
[KRILLIN] They're here!
Hey guys, wait up!

324
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:45,166
Where in the world are we?

325
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:46,750
General! It looks like
those pesky kids

326
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:48,750
are trying to
make a run for it.

327
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:50,833
Get them and quickly!

328
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:54,125
[SEAL SOLDIER]
This is Alpha Leader, over...

329
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:57,500
It's for you, sir. It's
Captain Dock of Company B.

330
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:01,458
Captain. Report.

331
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:06,875
What?!
The whole company defeated?!

332
00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:09,166
[BULMA screams] Stop!

333
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:11,500
What are you trying to do,
leave me behind?

334
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,541
Wait a minute.
Why are we running away?

335
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:15,875
Why can't we just...
talk this out?

336
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:17,291
No! They're not here to talk!

337
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:20,625
They have guns.
We have feet. So let's go!

338
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:22,500
[panting]

339
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:24,625
What's the matter?
What's wrong?

340
00:18:24,708 --> 00:18:26,708
I'm going to talk to them.

341
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:28,125
Goku, I knew you were strange,

342
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:29,458
but I didn't know
you were crazy!

343
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:32,250
Do you have a
death wish or something?

344
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:34,375
[SEAL SOLDIER] Hold it!
Don't go any further.

345
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:37,583
Come on back!

346
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:40,416
Uh... Where are they going?

347
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,208
I don't understand...

348
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:43,833
How come they don't
wanna come down here

349
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:45,041
and talk to us?

350
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:46,708
Way to go! You did it, champ!

351
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:50,041
Now let's get out of here
before they decide to come back!

352
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:51,875
[KRILLIN]
Maybe Goku scared them off.

353
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:54,541
Or maybe they're going back
to get some reinforcements.

354
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:55,666
Let's get moving.

355
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:58,125
This is it for me.
No more adventures.

356
00:18:58,208 --> 00:19:00,708
It seems we have
underestimated our enemy.

357
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:03,625
That is the fatal mistake our
predecessors made, I'm sure.

358
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:06,583
If we are to avoid their fate,
we must be careful.

359
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:09,666
[BALD SOLDIER] But sir, the
enemy is just a bunch of kids.

360
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,666
Yes, the same kids
that decimated

361
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,166
both Silver and White Corps.

362
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:15,708
Not to mention what
they did to Company B...

363
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:18,708
[BLUE] An entire company wiped
out by an old man and a girl,

364
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:21,250
who are known associates
of these kids!

365
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:24,500
[SOLDIERS gasp]

366
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:27,125
Do not think of them as
young, old, or by gender.

367
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:30,041
Simply know them as your enemy,
and all five will crumble

368
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:32,250
before this day is through.

369
00:19:34,916 --> 00:19:37,041
Bulma, are you sure
this path will lead us

370
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:39,166
to wherever the
Dragon Ball is hiding?

371
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:42,208
Pretty sure. Unless the
Red Ribbon Army gets us first.

372
00:19:42,291 --> 00:19:44,000
I don't see anybody
following us.

373
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:47,625
I can't see anything at all.
It's way too dark in here.

374
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:49,416
I know, we could
put Krillin up front!

375
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,291
His head could light the way.

376
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:52,916
That's not funny.

377
00:19:57,916 --> 00:19:59,291
[GOKU] Hmmm.

378
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:02,166
[ALL gasp]

379
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:03,541
[laughs]

380
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:05,458
Neat! I didn't know there were
lights in the ocean!

381
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:07,291
There aren't.
These are electric lights.

382
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:08,875
Okay. Now I'm scared.

383
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:11,291
One thing's for certain,
we're not the first ones here.

384
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:13,166
These lights had
to put up by someone.

385
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:15,083
I just hope
they aren't still here.

386
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:18,916
[BALD SOLDIER]
Man, what is all this about?

387
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,166
Interesting. Electrical.

388
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,291
We are not inside a cave...

389
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:27,166
Someone has turned this
into a base of some sort.

390
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:29,458
Now why would they do that?

391
00:20:29,541 --> 00:20:33,041
Strange. Who builds a base
at the bottom of the ocean?

392
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:36,375
[GOKU chuckles]
Hey! Look at me!

393
00:20:36,458 --> 00:20:38,583
[screams]

394
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,708
Sounds frightening...
Soldier, check it out.

395
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:46,291
Yes, sir.

396
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,250
[SOLDIER F shrieks]
[GOKU laughing]

397
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:54,958
[KRILLIN and BULMA] Goku!
[GOKU laughing]

398
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:57,291
[GOKU laughing]

399
00:20:57,375 --> 00:20:59,625
Gotcha!

400
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:02,916
You almost gave me a
heart attack, you little twerp!

401
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,750
Uh, Goku, where exactly
did you find that?

402
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:07,541
Next to that suit.

403
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:10,291
That's gross!

404
00:21:10,375 --> 00:21:11,916
Wait! The skull!

405
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,625
The mark of the pirate.

406
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:16,666
This must be the place Master
Roshi was talking about.

407
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:19,083
The Pirate's
sunken treasure. It's here!

408
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:20,041
[BULMA yells]

409
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:24,125
[cannon fire]

410
00:21:24,208 --> 00:21:30,916
[PIRATES commotion]

411
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:41,166
[BULMA squeals] All that gold
and jewelry and diamonds!

412
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:43,833
Oh, please let
there be diamonds!

413
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:45,666
He's a pirate?

414
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:47,833
[laughs] Yes! We did it!

415
00:21:47,916 --> 00:21:50,166
We discovered
the pirate's treasure!

416
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:51,833
[BULMA]
Who needs the Dragon Balls?

417
00:21:51,916 --> 00:21:53,583
We're rich! We're rich!

418
00:21:53,666 --> 00:21:55,583
General, I have
a visual on the kids,

419
00:21:55,666 --> 00:21:57,916
and you're not going to believe
what they've stumbled onto.

420
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,416
Are you telling me
that old tale is true?

421
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,875
That the fabled treasure exists!

422
00:22:01,958 --> 00:22:03,833
And it's right here
in this cave!

423
00:22:03,916 --> 00:22:06,125
Well done, soldier.
Get back here now.

424
00:22:06,208 --> 00:22:08,041
I want a full report.

425
00:22:08,125 --> 00:22:11,291
Ha-ha! We have just made the
greatest discovery of our age.

426
00:22:11,375 --> 00:22:14,166
And the most lucrative...

427
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:17,333
Supreme Commander Red
will be most pleased.

428
00:22:17,416 --> 00:22:19,291
[laughing]

429
00:22:19,375 --> 00:22:21,291
[BULMA and KRILLIN]
Hip, hip hooray!

430
00:22:21,375 --> 00:22:25,375
Hip, hip hooray!
Hip, hip hooray!

431
00:22:25,458 --> 00:22:27,416
[NARRATOR] As Goku
and his friends rejoice

432
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,666
over the buried treasure
they hope to find,

433
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:31,708
a few mysteries still linger.

434
00:22:31,791 --> 00:22:33,041
What happened to the pirates

435
00:22:33,125 --> 00:22:35,000
who supposedly
secured this wealth?

436
00:22:35,083 --> 00:22:37,416
Is their bounty
really hidden within the cave?

437
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:40,958
And if so, what danger awaits
those who attempt to claim it?

438
00:22:41,041 --> 00:22:42,958
After all,
where there is treasure,

439
00:22:43,041 --> 00:22:44,791
there are booby traps!

440
00:22:44,875 --> 00:22:47,041
Our heroes deserve
a moment of joy,

441
00:22:47,125 --> 00:22:48,708
but they should also beware,

442
00:22:48,791 --> 00:22:52,000
General Blue will stop at
nothing to get what he wants.

443
00:22:52,083 --> 00:22:54,458
Next time on Dragon Ball!
