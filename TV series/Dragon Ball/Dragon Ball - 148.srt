[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball,

2
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,708
the countdown to victory began

3
00:02:15,791 --> 00:02:19,250
with Goku poised to win the
World Martial Arts Tournament.

4
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:22,500
However, Junior put
a hole in Goku's plan

5
00:02:22,583 --> 00:02:24,791
by bouncing back
with a surprise attack

6
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:26,750
that nearly destroyed
the young hero.

7

[CHICHI]
You monster!

8
00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:31,208
[NARRATOR] As Junior
prepared to stamp Goku out,

9
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:33,541
his friends came to the rescue.

10
00:02:33,625 --> 00:02:37,458
Unfortunately, they failed.
But, they were able to distract

11
00:02:37,541 --> 00:02:40,916
the sinister warrior long
enough for Goku to recover.

12
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,375
[GOKU] Good thing you aim
as bad as you fight!

13

You missed my vital organs.

All of them?

15
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:50,208
[NARRATOR] Junior was shocked
by Goku's declaration

16
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:51,958
to continue the match.

17
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:53,583
It was clear to both opponents

18
00:02:53,666 --> 00:02:57,583
that this fight had become
a matter of life or death.

19
00:02:57,666 --> 00:03:00,250
And now, the final confrontation

20

to determine the real
master of martial arts!

The Eternal Dragon
and Dragon Balls

285

Yet, he's become so powerful
as to surpass even me,

plunging the world into chaos!

298
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:46,875

I've lost my perspective.

299
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:50,958
I no longer deserve to
govern this or any world.

300
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:53,416
How can you say such
things, when it was you

301

who brought our
world peace again?

302
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:57,583
If not for your training,

303
00:17:57,666 --> 00:18:00,750
Goku would never have attained
the level of skill he has now.

And if the Dragon Balls
hadn't been forged,

306
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:07,250
none of these young warriors
would have ever met.

307
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:09,708
And I can't begin to count
the number of people

308
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:12,833
who owe their lives
to these kids.

309
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:17,416
When their quest began,
they were just children.

But they soon grew into heroes.

Yeah!

312
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:28,541
When the world needed saving,
eight kids answered the call.

313
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:36,875
One ball, that's
how it all began.

314
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:47,375

had such an excellent teacher.

[GOKU] My reason for
helping you is simple.

If I destroyed you,
Kami would suffer as well.

Besides, without a
rival to fight,

I wouldn't have much to do. You
seem to fit that role nicely.

anything between you and I.

Mercy is a loathsome trait,

that I have no such weakness.
