[NARRATOR]
Previously on Dragon Ball,

2
00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:16,958
Goku and Yajirobe were
paid a visit by Cymbal,

3
00:02:17,041 --> 00:02:18,541
servant of King Piccolo,

4
00:02:18,625 --> 00:02:21,291
and charged with
retrieving the Dragon Balls.

5
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:24,083
Yajirobe, unwilling
to part with his,

6
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:27,833
fought the monster in
a fierce battle and won...

7
00:02:28,666 --> 00:02:32,083
[NARRATOR] ...cutting short
Cymbal's reign of terror.

8
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:38,583
[NARRATOR] Goku was astounded by
the mountain boy's strength.

9
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:40,541
Tambourine tracked down Yamcha

10
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:42,958
and attempted to make
him the eighth victim

11
00:02:43,041 --> 00:02:45,958
among the Martial Artists
he was sent to slay.

12
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:49,416
He may have succeeded if it
were not for his master's call.

13
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,875
[PICCOLO telepathically]
Tambourine!

14
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:52,791
Wait.

15
00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:55,000
[PICCOLO telepathically]
Cymbal was destroyed.

16
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:58,125
Our response to this crime
must be swift and severe.

17
00:02:58,208 --> 00:03:01,791
Abandon your current assignment
and find the assailant.

18
00:03:01,875 --> 00:03:05,041
[NARRATOR] Tambourine
was off to kill again.

19
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:22,666
[rumbling]

20
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:34,833
[ORANGE BEAR] Ahahahahaha!

21
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:41,958
Are you sure you
won't change your mind?

22
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:43,125
What do yee think?

23
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:46,041
I was the first to
find this. It's mine!

24
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:48,833
You don't need
that ball. Do you?

25
00:03:48,916 --> 00:03:51,500
It's simply a shiny trinket,
pleasing to the eye.

26
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:53,500
But I can tell
from your reaction,

27
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:57,041
it holds a great value,
at least to yee.

28
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:58,666
[ROSHI]
What is it you want? Money?

29
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:01,041
[ORANGE BEAR]
Arr, how about a million zeni?

30
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:02,541
[ROSHI] A million?!

31
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:04,250
[TIEN] You can't be serious.

32
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:07,708
[ORANGE BEAR] You heard me,
old man! [chuckles]

33
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:09,791
Take it or leave it!

34
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:12,208
[ROSHI]
You drive a hard bargain.

35
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:16,583

[ROSHI]
Tell ya what...

38
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:28,166
I'll give you this.

39
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,375
And what's that?

40
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:31,666
A lottery ticket
and a beer coupon.

41
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,208
Take it. Treat yourself.

42
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:35,083
[growls]

43
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:36,708
Forget it!

44
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:38,458
Okay.

45
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:40,583
[BOTH sigh]

00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:46,291
[ORANGE BEAR]
Boys!

47
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:58,208
Negotiations are over.
Too bad I don't have a plank.

48
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:01,208
I didn't want this
to get out of hand,

49
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:03,041
but you leave me no choice.

50
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:05,083
I need that ball.

51
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:08,541

00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:31,333
Huh?!

57
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:43,916
[ROSHI] Ah, those
coupons are looking

58
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,208
pretty good about now, huh?

59
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:00,750
[TIEN]
Hmmm...

00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:05,958
[TIEN chuckles]

61
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:10,291
Huh?

62
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:11,250
Ah!!

63
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:12,791
[ROSHI]
The Dragon Ball.

64
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:14,583
[ORANGE BEAR]
Awwww...

65
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:20,000
Thank you. Heh heh heh.

66
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,375
[YAJIROBE]
Why are you following me?

67
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:29,500
[GOKU] I told you.
If you keep the Dragon Ball,

68
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:31,500
you'll be attacked
by the monster.

69
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:33,291
[YAJIROBE]
Are you threatening me?

70
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:34,625
[GOKU]
No.

71
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:35,791
[YAJIROBE] So, then you
must be trying to scare me

72
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:37,250
thinking I'll give it to you.

73
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:38,833
Is that what you're up to?

74
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:42,416
[GOKU] No, I'm waiting for him
to attack so I can destroy him.

75
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,541
All you really want is the ball.

76
00:06:44,625 --> 00:06:46,250
I do need your Dragon Ball.

77
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:49,541
Would you mind if I borrowed it
once I find all the others?

78
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:50,666
[YAJIROBE]
I said no!

79
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,166
[GOKU]
I'm telling you the truth.

80
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:54,375
I just want to get Krillin back.

81
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:55,666
[YAJIROBE]
Hmph. Do what you want,

82
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,208
but I'm not giving up
my Dragon Ball.

83
00:06:57,291 --> 00:07:00,125
I'm selling it for a good price.

84
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:05,000
Hmm?

85
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:14,708
Stop chasing me!

86
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:17,708
I'm after the Dragon Ball,
not you, Yajirobe.

87
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:19,375
Yeah, right.

88
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:31,666
[YAJIROBE thinking]
Boy, this guy's super fast!

89
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:35,250
I'm not leaving you
until I find that monster.

[growls]

91
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:57,291
I want him! I'll tear him apart!

Uh, Master, calm down.
You need your strength.

[PICCOLO]
Uggh!

00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:08,416
I'm worried for your safety.

What are you talking about?

96
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:11,583
Remember the nice cooker?

97
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:13,541
What do you think we got it for?

98
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:16,333
Emperor, I've got a bad feeling.

99
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:18,041
What if this doesn't work?

100
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:21,291
Be patient Mai.
It won't take long.

101
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:25,250
[TAMBOURINE telepathically]
Your Majesty?

102

[PICCOLO]
Hmm?

104
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:32,000
What happened?
Did you find the culprit?

105
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:34,416
[TAMBOURINE telepathically]
There's no one here.

106
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,750
Whoever I'm after,
they've moved on.

They moved? Pilaf.

[PICCOLO telepathically]
Your target is headed northeast.

Hmmm...

120
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,833
[PICCOLO telepathically]
The target is stationary.

New coordinates are NW0123.

Huh?

Good, looks like
they know each other.

as bad luck would have it.

I thought I could
forget your face,

160
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,750
but I'm reminded of
it every time I move.

I don't remember much, except
the pain from 13 broken bones.

167
00:15:30,791 --> 00:15:34,625
It took me two years to
get back to this house...

168
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:38,875
...and my beautiful wife.

[baby babbling]

170
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:45,333
[RADIO] Seven members
of the Martial Arts Society

171
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:47,333
have fallen victim
to this unknown killer.

172
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:48,625
The culprit is still at large

173
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:51,416
with police getting
more anxious every day.

174
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,666
Come quickly.

175
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:55,416
[TIEN] I'm sorry
about your injuries.

176
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,583
I was a different
person back then.

177
00:15:57,666 --> 00:16:01,416
So was I. I could walk
without using a cane.

178
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,333
The reason I've come is
I need your Dragon Ball.

179
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:06,666
[MAN] Dragon Ball?
What the hell is that?

180
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,708
A ball with a star mark.

181
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:11,500
We know that you have
it here, somewhere.

182
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:13,208
Will you give it to us?

183
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:15,375
No, now go.

184
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:17,041
[TIEN]
Unacceptable!

185
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:19,541
[MAN]
I don't know of what you speak.

186
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:21,208
Hmph.

187
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:24,041
[MAN] What's more,
I think you're lying.

188

[gasps]

189
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:30,625
Even if it did exist, help
is the last thing I'd give you.

190
00:16:30,708 --> 00:16:32,083
Huh?!

191
00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:33,916
Hmmm...

192
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:37,416
Oh, what a beautiful day.

193
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:40,458
Don't worry about Tien.

194
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,458
You just leave that up to me.

195
00:16:42,541 --> 00:16:45,666
[motors]

196
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:56,125
Uh... Not good.

197
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:57,708
[TIEN]
I must have it.

198
00:16:57,791 --> 00:16:59,750
You sound like a broken record.

199
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:03,458
Get back!

200
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:05,833
[TIEN]
I'm not here to hurt you.

201
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:07,416
[door opens]

202
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,875
Tien Shinhan, you're
under arrest for murder.

203
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:16,625
[TIEN]
What?!

204
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:21,625
Unlike the police,
it didn't take us long

205
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:23,958
to identify the killer,
Tien Shinhan.

206
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:25,208
Who else is as strong

207
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:27,583
and delights in maiming
Martial Artists?

208
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:29,208
No! That's a lie!

209
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:32,708
You would kill anyone
if it suited your needs.

210
00:17:32,791 --> 00:17:34,333
I'm living proof.

211
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:35,250
You've got it wrong.

212
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:37,000
I'm not the one doing this!

213
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:38,375
The killer is King Piccolo!

214
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:40,416
[SERGEANT] Silence!
You can tell your story down

215
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,708
at the station. Take him!

216
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:46,833
Back off!

217
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:50,708
Why...

218
00:17:57,208 --> 00:17:58,333
[ROSHI]
Stop it!

219
00:17:58,416 --> 00:17:59,166
Huh...

220
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:01,000
[SERGEANT]
Hmm?

221
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,958
Huh?

222
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,541
Freeze dirt bag!

223
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:12,291
[ROSHI]
Hmm...

224
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:13,625
Huh?!

225
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:20,500
Uh, you must be...

226
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,708
Don't worry, sergeant.
I got him!

227
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:26,083
You idiot! Don't you
know who this is?

228
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:28,500
It's Master Roshi,
King of Martial Arts!

229
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:31,708
Uh?! Did you say king?!

230
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:32,833
Ah?!

00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:34,875
[gasps]

232
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:37,750
Uh, Master Roshi, what are you
doing here with this criminal?

233
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:40,250
Sergeant, Tien Shinhan
is no murderer.

234
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:41,958
He's a friend of mine.

235
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:44,083
And we're on important business.

236
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:45,958
Yeah, but...

237
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:49,083
Let it go, Sarge.

238
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:52,583
I can assure you
that Tien is not guilty.

239
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:54,750
[SERGEANT]
Stand down!

240
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:00,708
The Dragon Ball?

241
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:02,208
Why do you bother asking?

242
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:03,833
Just tear the place apart.

243
00:19:03,916 --> 00:19:06,875
That is your style,
isn't it Tien?!

244
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:12,291
Just hurry up
and get it over with.

245
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:18,791
I beg you, we
desperately need that ball.

00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:20,208
Ah!

247
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:22,375
[TIEN] I apologize for
the wrong I've done you.

248
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:23,500
If you want revenge,

249
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:25,416
break an arm or two.
Whatever you want.

250
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,875
But please,
give us the Dragon Ball.

251
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:30,000
Huh...

252
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:46,916
I've dreamed of revenge
longer than I can remember.

254
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,791
I forgive you. Get up.

255
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:06,875
[MAN] You may have
the Dragon Ball,

00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:37,000
Huh?

00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:40,208
Old man, did you
kill my brother?

Huh?

00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,416
Hmmm...

00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,458
Hello.

264
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:58,000
What's the big idea? Hmm?

265
00:20:58,083 --> 00:21:01,041
Ah ah! You're all crazy!

266
00:21:05,791 --> 00:21:06,750
Well, what'd ya know!

267
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:09,125
What Goku was
telling me was true.

268
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:10,541
If you keep the Dragon Ball,

269
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:12,875
you'll be attacked
by the monster.

270
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:15,125
Uh. Hmmm...

271

[GOKU]
Hey!

00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,625
Aw, that brat!

273
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,750
Huh?! No way.

274
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:37,333
You stay out of this Yajirobe!

275
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:40,208
It's my job to take
revenge for Krillin!

276
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:42,166
Aren't you dead?

277
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:46,666
I took care of you in the woods.

278
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:48,416
I told you I'd make you pay!

279
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,166
I'll never forgive you
for killing Krillin

280
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:52,666
or destroying my Nimbus Cloud!

281
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,875
And I want my Dragon Ball back!

282
00:21:55,916 --> 00:21:58,875
Listen Goku, you can off
this monster if you want.

283
00:21:58,958 --> 00:21:59,958
That's fine with me.

284
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:03,375
But you'd better
let me eat him! Agreed?!

285
00:22:03,458 --> 00:22:07,041
[TAMBOURINE] Now I understand.
How embarrassing.

286
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:08,708
My young brother, Cymbal,

287
00:22:08,791 --> 00:22:11,125
killed by a couple
of little rats!

288
00:22:11,208 --> 00:22:14,375
[YAJIROBE]
Rat?! You take that back! 

289
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:17,625
[TAMBOURINE chuckles]

290
00:22:17,708 --> 00:22:19,875
This is truly hilarious!

291
00:22:19,958 --> 00:22:22,416
You want to fight me again?

292
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,625
Last time you
didn't even touch me!

293
00:22:24,708 --> 00:22:27,000
Last time I was hungry.

294
00:22:27,083 --> 00:22:30,250
But now I'm full
and ready to beat you!

295
00:22:30,333 --> 00:22:31,291
[TAMBOURINE]
Beat me?!

296
00:22:31,375 --> 00:22:33,833
You're not even
in the same league!

297
00:22:33,916 --> 00:22:35,416
[GOKU] I'll stop you,
one way or another!

298
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,083
You'll see!

299
00:22:44,541 --> 00:22:46,875
This one's for, Krillin!

300
00:22:46,958 --> 00:22:49,041
[NARRATOR] Will Goku
make good on his promise

301
00:22:49,125 --> 00:22:50,625
and defeat Tambourine?
