[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball...

2
00:02:13,875 --> 00:02:17,375
Desperate to defeat Hero, Yamcha
launched his ultimate weapon,

3
00:02:17,458 --> 00:02:19,916
a missile of pure spirit energy.

[HERO yelps]

5
00:02:29,208 --> 00:02:31,541
[NARRATOR] Though his adversary
deftly dodged the bullet,

6
00:02:31,625 --> 00:02:34,250
he wasn't expecting
a second volley.

7
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:39,250
[YAMCHA]
Yeah! See ya, space nerd!

8
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:42,666
[NARRATOR] However, Yamcha
got a surprise of his own.

[YAMCHA yells]

10
00:02:49,041 --> 00:02:50,875
[NARRATOR]
Yamcha's defeat made it clear

11
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:53,791
that Hero was much more
than he appeared.

Fight after fight, warriors fell

as the World Martial Arts
Tournament continued.

14
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,750
Until at last, only two
contestants remained

15
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:06,666
in the semi-final round,

16
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,625

each other and the audience

The crowd seems entertained,

but they wouldn't
know a good fight

54

if it kicked them in the head.

If this is Goku's best,
I'll bury him.

Well done. I'm amazed
by your level of skill.

You were already near
perfection three years ago.

Now, even that word
seems inadequate

59

to describe your talents.

60
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:36,958
Thanks, but you should really
save that praise for yourself.

61

You're powerful!

62
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:42,250
Thank you, Goku. But seriously,

63
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:43,916
there's one skill
I've improved upon

64
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,375
that even you
can't keep up with.

65
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:47,625
Huh?

66
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:49,916
And it so happens to be
the most important tool

67
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,750
in a successful attack.

68
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:57,125

the skill of speed!

and yet, you're
still tracking me!

But, just because
you can see me,

84
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:05,333
doesn't necessarily
mean you know

it looks like the

is Tien Shinhan!

It's just a fact.

Your body is slower than mine
and that will be your undoing.

I appreciate
your concern. It's true.

shed some of these clothes.

be comfortable.

hard these last three years.

beginning to take its toll

on the fighters,
especially Goku.

139
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:01,416
He obviously hopes
to find some relief

140
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,833
by relieving himself
of his uniform,

141
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:07,125
an unusual solution,
but then these two titans

142
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:09,041
aren't your everyday warriors.

143
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:12,000
The speed with which they hurl
themselves around the ring

144
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:14,791
is nothing short of outrageous.

145

but a glimpse of the action,

146

short of slowing down
time itself!

147
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:22,500
At this point,
it's anyone's guess

148

as to which one
will go the distance.

Why is Tien acting so strangely?

Have you been wearing it
through the entire tournament?!

Yep, Kami told me to.
It was part of my training.

[GOKU] It's not much different
than Master Roshi's style.

He wore a big turtle
shell to gain strength.

175

It's pretty much
the same principle here.

It's really heavy!

189

It wasn't easy. Each of those

about a hundred kilos!

able to handle that much weight.

But it was all worth it.

Now that I'm not
carrying around that weight,

"playing your best card"?

No. I want to defeat you, not
blow you into a million pieces.
