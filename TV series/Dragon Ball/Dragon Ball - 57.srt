Sembei, can you fix this?

2
00:02:15,541 --> 00:02:18,250
[SEMBEI]
Sure. What is it?

3
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:19,958
It's a Dragon Radar.

4
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:22,000
A Dragon Radar?

5
00:02:22,583 --> 00:02:24,500
[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball...

6
00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:27,625
Arale brought Goku to see
Sembei Norimaki in hopes

7
00:02:27,708 --> 00:02:29,875
that he could repair
the Dragon Radar.

8
00:02:29,958 --> 00:02:32,375
However, General Blue
was also headed

9
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:34,791
for Sembei's house
to steal his airplane

10
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:39,041
and escape Penguin Village
with the stolen Dragon Balls.

11
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:46,541
Ah...

12
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:10,708
Do you think you can
fix it, Sembei?

13
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:12,958
Fix it? He'll make
it as good as new.

14
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:16,125
Sembei is an electronics genius.

15
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:17,458
Huh? Eh-hem.

16
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:19,250
There's nothing to
worry about, my boy.

17
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:22,666
Sembei Norimaki put the
possible in impossible.

18
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:25,500
Wow, how'd he do that?

19
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:30,125
[SEMBEI] Let's see now. This
little whatchamacallit is red.

20
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:32,250
That must mean
it's important. Yeah...

21
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:33,666
Definitely leave that in...

22
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,416
Okay, piece of cake.

[MAN]
This place looks a lot better

24
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:42,583
than it did on
the training video.

25
00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:43,750
Look at those flowers!

26
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:45,458
We didn't come halfway
across the galaxy

27
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:47,708
to collect flowers.

28
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:51,791
Yeah!

29
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:55,916
Pardon me, sire, but it
looks like it's garbage.

30
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,083
Not garbage! Treasure, dummy!

31
00:03:58,166 --> 00:04:00,583
Some fool was careless
enough to leave it behind

32
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:03,833
and if we didn't pick it up,
someone else would've!

33
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:06,958
Funny how their treasure
looks a lot like our trash.

Don't be ridiculous!

Who'd be dumb enough
to leave trash in the streets?

36
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:22,625
It appears, sire,
this treasure is empty.

37

Ah, what a strange
coincidence, so is your head!

38

Hurry, pick it up! This baby
could be worth a fortune!

[AKANE] I'm serious.
He flies on a cloud!

I saw it with my own eyes.

[TUN-TUK-TUN]
I'm sorry, Akane.

46

I'm sure the kid was
sitting on something,

47
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:47,125
but I doubt it was a cloud.

I'm telling the truth!
I know what I saw.

If you don't believe me,
why don't you go ask him?

His name is Goku.
Did I mention he knows karate?

Yes, yes. Everything's

Goku, please tell me more
about the Dragon Balls.

63
00:05:29,916 --> 00:05:32,291
There are seven
magic balls like this.

64
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:35,083
They have great power and
if you collect all of them,

you can ask for
one wish to come true.

if you had the Dragon Balls,

what would you wish for?

a rainbow that
never ends, and a flower

that changes color
every day. Oh, and--

Arale! Don't you remember?

00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:01,708
I told you the Dragon Balls
will only give you one wish.

Master Roshi's favorite chair.

[BLUE grunting]

163
00:10:38,541 --> 00:10:40,958
There's no sign of a
Dragon Ball anywhere in here.

164
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:42,708
Let's keep looking.

165
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:46,458
[GOKU]
Let's try down here.

166
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:49,583
[GOKU]
Whoa! Wait a minute.

167
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:54,791
[GOKU]
Down here. Huh?

168
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:56,000
[ARALE]
Huh?

169
00:10:56,083 --> 00:10:58,916
[GOKU] The signal is
really strong in here.

170
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,166
Maybe it's in this box.

171
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:05,416
Huh?

172
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,916
[BLUE, GOKU scream]

173
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,458
[SEMBEI, MIDORI]
Huh?

174
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:15,250
[GOKU grunting]

175
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:16,875
[ARALE]
Huh?

176
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:19,625
He has Arale!

177
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:22,625
[GATCHANS gasp]

178
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:23,625

[GOKU growls]

180
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:29,916
[BLUE laughs] Looks like
you've made a new friend.

181
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,250
[GOKU growling]
You leave her alone!

182
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:34,416
[BLUE]
Easy.

183
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,041
[GOKU growls]

184
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:41,458
[BLUE] This knife is very sharp.
I'd hate for my hand to slip.

185
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:43,458
Let her go!

186
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:46,375
[BLUE chuckles]

187
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:54,750
[BLUE]
I don't like these odds.

188
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:56,875
If any of you so much
as moves a muscle,

189
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:59,458
the girl gets it, understand?

190
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:01,416
Listen, Mr. whoever you are,

191
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:04,875
I wouldn't do that if I
were you. It's a very bad idea.

192
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:08,083
[BLUE chuckles] I'm the only
one with the bad ideas

193
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:09,375
around here, friend.

194
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:12,208
And believe me, you don't
want me to use one.

195
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:14,416
No, that-that's not
what I meant--

196
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,916
[BLUE gasps] What's the
matter with you people?

197
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,375
[SEMBEI, GATCHANS gasp]

[BLUE whimpers]

199
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:28,333
Alright, you big bully!

200
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:30,166
Give me back my
Dragon Balls right now!

201
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:33,083
[BLUE gasps, growls]

202
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:38,291
What? What are you doing?

203
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:41,416
Huh.

204
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,583
[MIDORI gasps]

205
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:46,541
Goku! What did he do to you?

206
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:52,500
He froze my body again!

207
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:53,375
What?

208
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:54,833
He can't defend himself.

209
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:57,791
[GOKU grunting]

210
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:11,791
This is the
Penguin News Network!

211
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:14,208
We interrupt your program
for this important bulletin.

212
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:16,291
We're the first to bring
you this exclusive story!

213
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:17,708
We've just received information

214
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:19,791
that the Red Ribbon Army
is attacking Penguin Village!

215
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:22,416
With us now is Jay Daybe,
whose brother's best friend

216
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,166
knows someone who supposedly
thought about joining

217
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:26,125
the Red Ribbon Army once
and wrote a book about it.

218
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:28,375
Mr. Daybe, can you tell us
what you think may have caused

219
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:29,791
these notorious bandits--

220
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:31,916
Looks bad.

221
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,583
[PIGS scream]

222
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:38,708
[GOKU growls]
I can't move. Frozen...

223
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:41,916
Goku, calm down.
You're not making any sense.

224
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,791
There has to be an explanation.

225
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:46,541
Papa. That man has powers.

226
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:47,833
Oh.

227
00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:50,791
Goku, is this man
a friend of yours?

228
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:53,708
He's a bad man.
He took my Dragon Balls.

229
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,791
[MIDORI gasps]

230
00:13:55,875 --> 00:14:00,416
[BLUE laughs] You are a
glutton for punishment.

231
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,666
When will you ever learn that
there's nothing you possess

232
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,666
which I cannot take away.

233
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:07,458
Not even your
precious little radar!

234
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:12,375
Ugh. That's mi--

235
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:14,916
That's mine, give it back to me!

236
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,875
[SEMBEI] Excuse me, but that
really does belong to the boy.

237
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:20,166
You've been very
passive thus far.

238
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:23,458
Do yourself a favor and
don't mess it up now.

239
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:29,250
Oh, I'm in a hurry
so I'd better fly.

240
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:31,041
No problem, sir, but...

241
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:33,541
I haven't finished
the instruments yet.

I'm forgetting something?

Oh, that's right!
How silly of me.

245
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:45,833
I almost forgot the
most important thing of all.

324
00:18:58,458 --> 00:19:02,666
[ARALE] I'm here!
Good, you're well again!

325
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:03,916
Where is he?

326
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,833
I don't know. He hasn't
come down yet, silly.

327
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:09,250
Huh. He's still up in the sky?

328
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:11,500
I sure hope he took a snack.

329
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:13,583
You're one of the strongest
people I've ever met.

330
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:16,166
[ARALE giggles]
Thank you. But I'm nothing

331
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:17,916
compared to the Gatchans.

332
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,416
[GATCHANS coo]

333
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:24,625
Whoa!

334
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:26,875
That's incredible.

335
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:28,750
[GATCHANS]
Wah-hoo!

336
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:30,625
Oh, that was nothing, trust me.

337
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:35,000
They must be tired. You should
catch them on a good day!

338
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:36,416
I thought I was strong.

339
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,625
I never knew there was
so much I can't do.

340
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:41,458
I guess I need to
start training harder.

341
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:44,958
Hey! I almost forgot
about the Dragon Balls!

342
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,125
[GOKU]
Here they are!

343
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:49,750
Perfect!

344
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:55,333
Oh no! The Dragon Radar!
It's missing!

345
00:19:55,416 --> 00:19:58,625
[GOKU]
He wasn't holding the radar.

346
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:03,375
So if it's not here...
It must still be in his pocket!

347
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:04,375
[GOKU grunts]

348
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:05,958
How am I going to
find him again?

349
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:08,375
I never should've
let him take it.

350
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:12,500
That guy still has
the radar and without it,

351
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:16,875
I can't get back home.
I'm stuck here.

352
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:19,708
Oh, don't be sad.

353
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:21,875
I can make you a
new one if you want.

354
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:24,958
You-You can? But how?

355
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:30,791
Papa, can I please have a few
parts off your airplane?

356
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:32,000
Sure, son.

357
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:34,416
But are you sure you can
make a Dragon Radar?

358
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,916
I saw the one you fixed.

359
00:20:43,916 --> 00:20:47,041
That's a little more
than a few parts, son.

360
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:50,041
[ARALE giggles]
[GOKU] How does he do that?

361
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:57,791
[GOKU laughs]

362
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:00,041
Here.

363
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:05,708
[beeping]

364
00:21:05,791 --> 00:21:07,208
Ah!

365
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:10,791
It's working!

366
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:12,583
[GOKU]
Thank you very much!

367
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:13,875
[TURBO]
You're welcome.

368
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:17,291
[SEMBEI laughs]
That's my boy, alright!

369
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:19,583
A genius just like his old man.

370
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:23,500
Flying Nimbus!

371
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:30,875
Thanks for everything
you've done for me.

372
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:32,333
You should think about joining

373
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,791
the martial arts tournament
next year. You'd be great!

374
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:36,541
[ARALE]
Hm?

375
00:21:39,541 --> 00:21:41,250
[GOKU]
Goodbye!

376
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:45,458
See ya later!

377
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,416
[GOKU laughing]

378
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,083
[GATCHANS cheering]

379
00:21:51,166 --> 00:21:53,458
[ARALE giggling]

380
00:21:53,541 --> 00:21:56,166
[GOKU giggling]

381
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,583
Son, how about helping
me out with my airplane?

382
00:22:03,375 --> 00:22:04,458
No, sir.

383
00:22:04,541 --> 00:22:07,166
The Dragon Balls
are still at large.

384
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:10,541
[BLUE] I did, however,
manage to get his radar.

385
00:22:10,625 --> 00:22:13,083
[STAFF OFFICER] You have
possession of the Dragon Radar?

386
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:15,791
It's in my hand as we speak.

387
00:22:15,875 --> 00:22:16,833
[STAFF OFFICER]
Excellent.

388
00:22:16,916 --> 00:22:19,166
Return to headquarters
immediately.

389
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:22,458
[BLUE]
Well... uh...

390
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:24,833
[STAFF OFFICER]
Is there a problem?

391
00:22:24,916 --> 00:22:27,375
[BLUE]
Uh, no... well... um...

392
00:22:27,458 --> 00:22:30,583
It's just that um...
It's kind of hard to explain...

393
00:22:30,666 --> 00:22:32,458
It might take a while
to get back...

394
00:22:32,541 --> 00:22:37,958
because I don't know where I am!

395
00:22:39,125 --> 00:22:40,458
[NARRATOR]
It's been quite an adventure

396
00:22:40,541 --> 00:22:41,791
for our young hero.

397
00:22:41,875 --> 00:22:44,333
He leaves Penguin Village
with three Dragon Balls,

398
00:22:44,416 --> 00:22:48,000
a new radar, and most
importantly, new friends.

399
00:22:48,083 --> 00:22:51,250
Join us next time,
as Goku continues his quest,

400
00:22:51,333 --> 00:22:53,541
only on Dragon Ball!
