1
00:02:13,583 --> 00:02:16,250
[NARRATOR] On the last
episode of Dragon Ball...

2
00:02:17,291 --> 00:02:19,666
Never tangle with
the Red Ribbon Army.

3
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:20,958
All available men!

4
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:23,916
Get down there and
find that Dragon Ball!

5
00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:26,375
[NARRATOR] Colonel Silver
and the Red Ribbon Army

6
00:02:26,458 --> 00:02:30,208
ambushed the Ox King's village
in search of a Dragon Ball.

7
00:02:30,291 --> 00:02:31,708
The oversized
Ox King struggled

8
00:02:31,791 --> 00:02:34,041
against the army's
awesome firepower...

9
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:36,333
but ultimately, his brute
strength was no match

10
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:38,875
for Colonel Silver's
advanced weaponry.

11
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:41,125
Ahh! I can't see!

12
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,541
At last... it's all mine.

13
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:44,875
[NARRATOR]
Meanwhile, Emperor Pilaf

14
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:47,583
saw his opportunity
to grab the prize.

15
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:51,416
[SILVER] Get him!

16
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,416
[NARRATOR] Colonel Silver
watched the Dragon Ball

17
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,958
slip away as
Emperor Pilaf reached

18
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:02,291
the safety of
his flying fortress.

19
00:03:02,375 --> 00:03:06,333
The little blue tyrant's
sneakiness paid off this time...

20
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:08,083
but for how long?

21
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:10,208
You won't escape me!

22
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:41,416
Hey! What's that?

23
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,333
[CHICHI] It's gigantic!

24
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:13,000
You're safe now.

25
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:15,708
Whew, I sure hope so!

26
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:32,333
Help! Help!
Goku! Help me!!

27
00:04:32,416 --> 00:04:37,458
L-L-L-Leggo... of my...

28
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:41,458
...TAIL!

29
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:44,208
[GOKU] Nimbus!

30
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:01,625
[PILAF]
He, he, he, he... Yeess...

31
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:02,708
there's nothing like the glow

32
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:05,875
from a genuine
Dragon Ball is there...?

33
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:10,791
Not that you two would know,
but it's un-mis-takable!

34
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:12,291
Unmistakable?

35
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:15,541
Then how come he paid all
that money for that fake ball...

36
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:18,750
Hey, what did you say?

37
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:20,875
Ow! Nothing.

38
00:05:22,916 --> 00:05:24,666
So about those army people...

39
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,583
Are they still chasing us?

40
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:28,000
Yes, they're following,

41
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:30,833
but for the time being
they're keeping their distance.

42
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:34,083
I think we're still safely
outside of their attack range.

43
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:36,416
I wonder who, they are...

44
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,416
[SOLDIER A] Who are they,
Colonel Silver?

45
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,416
Probably some reckless
millionaires looking for kicks.

46
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,875
They don't know what
they're getting into...

47
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:47,541
Now less questions,
and more flying!

48
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:49,125
[SOLDIER A] Yes sir!

49
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:54,583
[SILVER] All soldiers, man
your fighter jets immediately.

50
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:56,666
Stand by for my coordinates.

51
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:24,958
What was that for?

52
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:26,791
I'll ask the questions!

53
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:28,750
This is my garden!

54
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:30,291
Who are you people?

55
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:33,291
I don't like her tone of voice!

56
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:45,208
[CHICHI squeals]

57
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:45,916
Huh?

58
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,041
[SOLDIER] Augh!

59
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:50,291
[CHICHI] Stay away!
Aaah!

60
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:53,750
I want my daddy!
Someone help me!

61
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:56,000
You're not
supposed to hit girls!

62
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:07,625
[sobs]

63
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:09,666
Where did'ya
take the Ox King?

64
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,958
He's that way.

65
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,833
You're okay!

66
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:30,208
[CHICHI] Oh, Daddy!

67
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,875
Let's get out of here!

68
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:52,666
Well look at that!

69
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,833
[CHICHI] Are you okay, Dad?

70
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:57,500
[GOKU] Sir, you gotta be strong!

71
00:07:57,583 --> 00:07:59,291
[CHICHI] We need you!

72
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:15,750
[SOLDIER A] It's getting foggy.
Visibility is poor.

73
00:08:16,541 --> 00:08:18,041
[SOLDIER A] It-it's impossible!

74
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:19,875
Huh? What?

75
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:22,833
[SOLDIER A] They've
vanished into thin air!

76
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:32,625
Up! Go above the clouds!

77
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,500
[SILVER] Hmm... Not here...

78
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:49,666
Well, I guess the hunt is on...

79
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,375
Serves 'em right!

80
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:39,250
Oh yea, who's got it now?

81
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:50,541
Hey, who were those guys?

82
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:52,458
Did you know them?

83
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:54,958
Ah, well, no, but given my past,

84
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:58,000
I must have some
enemies out there.

85
00:09:58,083 --> 00:10:01,583
You see, I used
to be a very bad man.

86
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:03,416
But that's beside the point.

87
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,500
They crashed your party!

88
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:06,833
Uh? Party?

89
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:08,541
What are you talking about?

90
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:11,000
I wasn't having a party?

91
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:12,333
You're terrible!

92
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:15,416
How can you even
pretend you don't know?

93
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,791
[GOKU] I-I don't know what?

94
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:20,875
Well, isn't this interesting?

95
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:22,916
You sure seemed to
enjoy the wedding feast

96
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,708
we prepared for you.

97
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:25,833
Feast?

98
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:27,500
What, do you mean
those apples I ate?

99
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:30,750
No... the... you were...

100
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:38,791
Look, there!

101
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:40,500
[SOLDIER A]
Hey! We're down here!

102
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:44,250
We're down here! Hey! Look down!

103
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:49,333
Heeey! Heeey...! Down here!

104
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:56,458
Headquarters.
This is Silver.

105
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:57,583
We have come under fire,

106
00:10:57,666 --> 00:10:59,541
and have lost our
fix on the target...

107
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:03,166
Can you pinpoint their location
with the Dragon Radar?

108
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,583
So, if that wasn't Goku
at dinner, where was he?

109
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:11,416
Oh-h!

110
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,875
He was with me.

111
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:14,291
He came right out
of an apple tree

112
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:16,166
when I was at the pond...

113
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,541
We were talking about
how nice it will be

114
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:21,166
to be married and have a family!

115
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:26,083
Then, who fooled me
at the table tonight?

116
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,083
Well whoever they were,

117
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:31,000
I'll bet they were
after the Dragon Ball.

118
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:32,458
The Dragon Ball?

119
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:35,250
You mean like the one
you got from my castle?

120
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:37,583
[GOKU] Yes... there
are seven balls in all.

121
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:39,375
One of them
belonged to my grandpa.

122
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:41,666
That's the one I'm looking for.

123
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:45,666
Gohan's? It was
really Gohan's?

124
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,375
Uh huh...

125
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:50,208
[GOKU] Let's see
what the radar says.

126
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:52,416
Oh, it's moved so far away!

127
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,166
Thanks, I gotta go! Bye!

128
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:56,041
[CHICHI] Goku!

129
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:57,708
Huh?

130
00:11:57,791 --> 00:12:00,375
What about the wedding?

131
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:01,583
I'll be back!

132
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:04,708
I'll try some of that
next time! Goodbye!

133
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:06,625
Goku!

134
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:10,458
[CHICHI] Uh!

135
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:12,750
[GOKU] See ya later, Chichi!

136
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:18,916
[CHICHI] Goku!
"Wedding" is not a food!

137
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:22,875
Be patient.

138
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:24,625
That boy is on a quest...

139
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:27,208
But he'll be back. One day.

140
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:45,166
[STAFF OFFICER] The radar shows
the ball is now stationary.

141
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:48,791
[SILVER] Sir we've just
reached the coordinates.

142
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:50,833
Need to verify the position.

143
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:56,791
I have PX 303
southwest, correct?

144
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:58,250
[STAFF OFFICER] Roger.

145
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:02,083
It's within a 1 mile radius
of your current location.

146
00:13:02,166 --> 00:13:04,291
[SILVER] There's nothing
here but a barren desert.

147
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:05,583
They wouldn't have
ditched the ball here

148
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:07,416
after such a hard
time getting it.

149
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,208
It doesn't make sense!

150
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:11,750
[STAFF OFFICER]
The radar is highly accurate.

151
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:13,666
Your current
position is correct!

152
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:15,208
Now you're wasting time.

153
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:17,208
You can mull over
how much 'sense'

154
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:18,250
all of this makes to you

155
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:19,500
while you're
conducting your search.

156
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:20,875
You had better get started.

157
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:22,875
It'll be dark soon.

158
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,333
[GOKU] Hey, did
I turn the wrong way?

159
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:31,375
I thought I was
reading it right...

160
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:02,791
[SILVER thinking]
If that huge fortress landed

161
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:06,291
or crashed I would
surely see it out here.

162
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,958
I don't think we'll
find anything around here.

163
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:20,041
That radar's broken! Ya' know?

164
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:22,416
I agree, I think
they spent too much

165
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,208
on that piece of junk!

166
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:27,333
Oh-h yeah, big money.

167
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:30,583
Huh? Huh? Uh?

168
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:31,916
Hey, come 'ere!

169
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,291
You find it?

170
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:36,041
No, no...

171
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:39,291
Aaaah!

172
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:59,000
[PILAF] Welcome
to my humble abode.

173
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:00,708
Who's that?

174
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:05,208
I am Emperor Pilaf.

175
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:07,208
[PILAF] I presume you
belong to some army,

176
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:09,750
what with those snappy
uniforms of yours.

177
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:11,250
Why don't you come work for me?

178
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:13,250
Never! Just let us go!

179
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:16,375
[PILAF] Well, you may change
your mind soon enough!

180
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:17,500
Look at this!

181
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,458
What is it?

182
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:21,500
[PILAF] Put it on my monitor.

183
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:25,625
[PILAF] That kid!
He's after me again!

184
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:29,125
[PILAF] What does it take
to get rid of this pest?

185
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:36,125
Well, according to this,
it's supposed to be right here!

186
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:41,083
[SILVER] This is Silver.
Come in, Search Party.

187
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,958
Answer me!

188
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:45,125
Is there anybody down there?

189
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:46,500
This is Colonel Silver!

190
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:48,666
Do you read?
Search Party, come in!

191
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:50,125
[GOKU] Huh?

192
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:54,083
[PILAF] He's coming this way!

193
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:56,708
[SHU] Do you think
he noticed the camera?

194
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,125
[GOKU sighs and urinates]

195
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:10,000
Ew! No, No, No!

196
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:23,541
What the...

197
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:25,791
Who in the heck is that kid?

198
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:28,708
The planes!

199
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:37,416
An underground base!

200
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:06,125
Silver to base...
Silver to base.

201
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:07,875
I found the enemy's
headquarters.

202
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:10,458
It is at PX 303 SW.

203
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:12,625
Send reinforcements now!

204
00:17:12,708 --> 00:17:14,875
[STAFF OFFICER]
Roger, we'll send Brown's army.

205
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:16,916
Just sit tight and wait.

206
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,083
[SILVER] There's no
time to wait, you imbecile!

207
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:32,333
Welcome, young friend.

208
00:17:32,416 --> 00:17:34,333
You're not my friend!

209
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:36,833
No, of course not.

210
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:39,458
Give me my
grandpa's Dragon Ball!

211
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:40,833
Nyaaaah!

212
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:43,333
Sorry, I had a different
present in mind.

213
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:01,375
I know you!

214
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:03,541
You're the monster that stole
our Dragon Balls last time!

215
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:07,583
[PILAF] What's this?

216
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:10,333
[GOKU] Kamehame...

217
00:18:10,416 --> 00:18:12,291
Haa!

218
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,458
My robot...

219
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:21,750
[MAI] They're attacking
from the air!

220
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:33,541
[SILVER] All right, I've got
you just where I want you now!

221
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:43,291
Don't just stand
there, you fools!

222
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:45,333
Man the guns!

223
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:46,833
Sire!

224
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:24,416
Are we gonna retreat?

225
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:27,333
[PILAF] What a stupid question.
Of course we are!

226
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:39,083
[GOKU] Wait!

227
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:48,458
[GOKU] Get back here!

228
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,958
[PILAF] Shu, hit the switch!

229
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:58,833
No sweat!

230
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:24,125
You won't get away from me!

231
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:33,041
Well, well, well,
here it comes.

232
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:47,416
Hit the gas! Full throttle!
NOW! Let's go!

233
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:27,291
Hey! Nimbus! Nimbus!

234
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:49,916
[coughing]

235
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,875
Ahh, they'll
never take you away...

236
00:21:51,958 --> 00:21:53,500
My precious...

237
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:55,125
Emperor!

238
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:56,958
We're hidden by the smoke!

239
00:21:57,041 --> 00:21:59,125
They won't be able to see us!

240
00:22:00,166 --> 00:22:01,916
Thank goodness!
We're saved!

241
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,791
Of course we are!

242
00:22:04,458 --> 00:22:08,000
Nyahahahahahaha!

243
00:22:09,791 --> 00:22:11,166
Ohh!

244
00:22:29,625 --> 00:22:32,416
[SILVER snickers]

245
00:22:36,791 --> 00:22:39,250
[NARRATOR] Emperor Pilaf has
been cornered by the fierce

246
00:22:39,333 --> 00:22:43,500
Red Ribbon Army and stripped
of his prized possession.

247
00:22:43,583 --> 00:22:45,375
But where is Goku?

248
00:22:45,458 --> 00:22:48,208
Did he escape the
explosion in one piece?

249
00:22:48,291 --> 00:22:53,583
You'll have to watch to find
out--next time on Dragon Ball!
