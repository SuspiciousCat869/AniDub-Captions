00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:16,000
[NARRATOR]
Previously on Dragon Ball...

2
00:02:17,166 --> 00:02:18,458
[NARRATOR]
The full moon was out,

3
00:02:18,541 --> 00:02:22,250
and Goku transformed
into a giant, killer ape!!

4
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:23,791
Ka...

5
00:02:23,875 --> 00:02:25,708
[NARRATOR] Determined to protect
all the innocent spectators

6
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:28,083
at the tournament,
Jackie Chun fired

7
00:02:28,166 --> 00:02:31,458
his maximum power
Kamehameha Wave!

8
00:02:31,541 --> 00:02:33,375
Ha!!!!

9
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:38,875
[NARRATOR] Yamcha tried
to stop the old master

10
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:41,041
from releasing
this deadly attack,

11
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:43,333
knowing Goku could
return to normal

12
00:02:43,416 --> 00:02:45,750
if they just cut off his tail!

13
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:49,375
[NARRATOR] But it was too late.

14
00:02:49,458 --> 00:02:53,666
The attack had been launched,
and the damage had been done...

15
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,833
And when the energy
blast cleared out,

16
00:02:55,916 --> 00:02:59,083
the monstrous ape
was nowhere to be found...

17
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:10,875
What did he do to our Goku?

18
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:15,125
Goku! Oh no you can't be gone!

19
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:16,916
[NARRATOR] Is this true...?

20
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,500
Has the rampaging ape
really been stopped...?

21
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:23,291
Has Jackie Chun really
put Goku down for good...?

22
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:26,375
Will Bulma and the others
have to say good-bye

23
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:28,291
to their loyal friend...?

24
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:37,125
[NARRATOR] Many things
are up in the air,

25
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:38,875
but one thing is certain...!

26
00:03:38,958 --> 00:03:42,250
The World Martial Arts
Tournament ends today!

27
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:43,791
On Dragon Ball.

28
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:55,666
[ANNOUNCER]
This has been a fight

29
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,708
for the history books,
ladies and gentlemen!

30
00:03:57,791 --> 00:03:58,875
[ANNOUNCER] Wow...!

31
00:03:58,958 --> 00:04:01,208
Who could have imagined
such a great end!

32
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:03,958
What... is he saying?

33
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:06,833
[BULMA sobs] Great end?

34
00:04:06,916 --> 00:04:09,041
Doesn't anyone
understand what happened?

35
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:11,541
I'm... not even sure I do...

36
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:13,666
[ANNOUNCER]
And so it's been decided...!

37
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:16,500
Jackie Chun will be
the new World Champion!

38
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:18,000
He's no champion...!

39
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:21,875
He's a murderer...!
It isn't fair!

40
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:24,375
[KRILLIN] Give us Goku back!

41
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:26,041
[OOLONG] Dumb old fool!

42
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:28,458
He was our friend!

43
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:33,791
Don't you just stand there...!

44
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:38,791
Hey!! Do you hear me?!!
Say something!!!

45
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,375
Calm down...
Look over there.

46
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:48,875
Hey is that a--??

47
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:50,708
A tail...

48
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,250
And that's a naked boy...

49
00:04:57,541 --> 00:04:59,833
Yay! Goku's alive!

50
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:05,000
Yamcha he made it!

51
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:08,375
Goku wasn't the target
of my Kamehameha Wave...

52
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:20,000
That was!

53
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:25,708
[ANNOUNCER]
There's nothing there!

54
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:29,458
The sky! It's been...
de-mooned! It's gone!

55
00:05:29,541 --> 00:05:31,291
[CHUN] Well with the
moon destroyed it can't possibly

56
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:35,041
get full again so Goku
won't turn into a big ape!

57
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:39,541
[CHUN thinking] Sometimes
I'm so clever it amazes even me.

58
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:40,750
[ANNOUNCER]
Ladies and Gentlemen!

59
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:44,666
Jackie Chun has done
a reprehensible thing!!!

60
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:47,500
What's going to light up
the skies for us at night...?!

61
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:49,875
What about romantic
moonlit walks?!!

62
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:52,916
And you can just say good-bye
to relaxing ocean wave CDs!!!

63
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,250
What about the Wolf-Man?

64
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:55,875
What will he howl at?!

65
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:58,875
Stop being a goof
and start counting!

66
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:00,833
Oh yeah, of course...

67
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:04,166
[ANNOUNCER]
One...! Two...!

68
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:08,000
Hey! I thought for sure
I was wearing clothes...

69
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:10,166
Darn you! If you
had started counting

70
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,833
when you were supposed
to, I would've won!

71
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:16,000
That's... funny...

72
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:19,500
[cheering]

73
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:21,375
That little guy
really had me worried.

74
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:24,458
Haha! Yeah...
He's pretty good at that.

75
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:26,291
And continue!

76
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:32,125
Whew...

77
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:34,833
Blowing up the moon can
really drain your energy...

78
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:39,333
That last attack took
a lot out of him...!

79
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:41,541
Goku! You can win!

80
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:42,625
Right!

81
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:46,125
[girls tittering]

82
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:47,125
Oh stop!!

83
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:48,958
I shouldn't
look but I am...

84
00:06:53,416 --> 00:06:54,541
What's wrong, sirs?

85
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:56,708
What are you all
giggling about...?

86
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,833
I get it! You must be girls!

87
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:04,000
Okay on second thought,
stop fighting...!

88
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:05,791
Goku! Do you wanna get me fired?

89
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:08,083
[KRILLIN] Don't worry...!
He can borrow my suit!

90
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:16,375
I wonder if my clothes ran
away when I was sleeping...

91
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:17,291
[KRILLIN] Don't worry, I already
made a tail-hole

92
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:18,500
in the back for you...

93
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:20,875
You know, you really
freaked me out, Goku...

94
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:22,000
So what's it like

95
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:24,375
to run around as a
giant scary monster?

96
00:07:24,458 --> 00:07:25,458
I don't know...

97
00:07:25,541 --> 00:07:28,250
[KRILLIN] Oh... come on,
you can tell me!

98
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:30,375
I'll keep secrets!

99
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:33,083
Tell you what now?

100
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:34,708
Fine, meanie

101
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:37,083
But I know... If I could...

102
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:40,166
I'd jump on mountains...!
And make earthquakes!

103
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:42,041
[GOKU] You're strange...

104
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,375
[GOKU] Gee... What's wrong with
the arena...?

105
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:47,500
It looks like there
<i>was</i> an earthquake...

106
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:51,250
Now... Here comes
Goku to the ring...!

107
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:53,250
Wearing plenty of clothes!

108
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:56,291
[GOKU] I'm gonna wrap
this up, Mr. Jackie!

109
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:02,541
[tummy growls]

110
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:03,708
Hungry...

111
00:08:03,791 --> 00:08:05,250
Unguarded!

112
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:07,958
Ka-me-ha-me...

113
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:10,791
Haaaa!!!!

114
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:19,458
[ANNOUNCER] Oooh!
What a drag for Jackie Chun!

115
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:23,125
His energy attack has fizzled
out like a flat can of soda-pop!

116
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:24,750
[CHUN]
Don't quit on me now!

117
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:27,166
I guess he doesn't
have enough energy left!

118
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,541
Come on.

119
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:30,625
[GOKU] And that means
he can't fly anymore either!

120
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:31,791
And that makes it easy...!

121
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:35,083
Ka... me... ha... me...

122
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:36,541
Now wait a second!

123
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:39,166
Ha!!!!

124
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:43,458
Here goes!

125

[panicked noises]

126
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:00,083
It worked!

127
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:01,666
Oh no!

128
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,208
I'm going to land
outside the ring!!!

129
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:06,333
Come on now!

130
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:27,166
Goku, you did it...!
It's a ring-out!

131
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:29,500
[CROWD cheers]

132
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:32,041
[ANNOUNCER] Jackie Chun has
landed outside of the ring!

133
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:36,250
That makes Goku the new Martial
Arts Champion of the World!

134
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:37,791
[GOKU] Yay!

135
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:39,291
Way to go!

136
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:41,666
[CHUN] Excuse me!

137
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,791
The fight isn't over just yet...

138
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:48,625
Look at my feet, carefully.

139
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:56,500
My... feet haven't
touched outside the ring...

140
00:09:57,583 --> 00:09:59,666
Wow... Well I'll be...

141
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:02,833
[ANNOUNCER]
The fighting continues!

142
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:10,000
You sure are
a lucky fellow...

143
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:15,125
I was in control
the whole ti--time...

144
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:19,958
Your Kamehameha Wave is
too weak to do damage now.

145
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:21,416
[GOKU] It is?

146
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,250
I'm afraid that
your fatigue and hunger

147
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:26,291
have drained your energy past
the breaking point...

148
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:28,458
Same with me...

149
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:32,083
We've both done every fancy
trick our bodies can handle...

150
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:36,833
It looks like we'll have to rely

151
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:41,208
on good old karate chops and
flying kicks to finish this...

152
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:44,041
The strongest man
will stay standing...

153
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:46,166
It's as simple as that.

154
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:48,416
Sounds like fun to me.

155
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:55,666
Come on, Goku...
Give everything you've got...

156
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:58,791
Let's make this
finale worthwhile.

157
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:01,625
No tricks,
no fancy shows...

158
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:05,083
Right... No energy attacks...

159
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:09,833
Just fist-to-fist
martial arts...

Absolutely amazing...!

Goku and Jackie Chun
have launched

162
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:40,291
into the most intense
close-combat we've seen yet...!

00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:41,500
Such stamina!

164
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:43,708
By my watch,
they've been fighting for,

165
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:45,958
oh my gosh, over four hours!

166
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:48,125
And you can't even tell!

167
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,833
[ANNOUNCER] Okay...
maybe you can tell a little bit.

168
00:12:21,916 --> 00:12:24,041
What a play!

169
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:27,041
Despite obvious physical
exhaustion on both sides,

170
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:29,666
neither of these fighters
is willing to give up...!

171
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,958
They just... keep... GOING!

172
00:12:59,791 --> 00:13:01,583
[CHUN thinking]
This boy's gonna wear me out

173
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:02,833
if I don't finish him soon...!

174
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:05,041
I definitely need a knockout!

175
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:07,375
But what finishing
move can I use...?

176
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:09,458
His body's too
small for a lock...

177
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:12,958
Just a stubby torso
and short little legs...

178
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:16,541
[CHUN thinking]
Yes...! Of course!

179
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:17,583
Hey...!

180
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:20,500
How 'bout...
one final charge, Goku?

181
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,625
Fine!

182
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:30,875
[ANNOUNCER] This could be it!

183
00:13:57,083 --> 00:13:59,458
[ANNOUNCER] You--
you saw it yourself, folks!

184
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:01,791
A double knockout...!

185
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:03,708
By the rules, I have
to start counting...!

186
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:10,000
One...! Two...! Three!

187
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:10,916
Four!

188
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,958
Come on Goku...!
Just stand up!

189
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:16,416
Six!

190
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:19,291
[ANNOUNCER] Seven!

191
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:21,541
Get along there,
Jackie Chun!

192
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:23,708
Goku...! Stand up!

193
00:14:23,791 --> 00:14:25,000
[ANNOUNCER] Eight!

194
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,375
That's the spirit, kiddo!

195
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,833
Nine!

196
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:38,833
[ANNOUNCER] Ten!!!!

197
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:46,583
[ANNOUNCER] Neither one
of them were able to stand!

198
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:48,500
Common rules would
label this a draw...!

199
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:50,666
But the World Martial Arts
Tournament can't go

200
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,500
without a champion!

201
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:54,916
I believe in these
rare situations...

202
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,458
the first person who stands...

203
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:59,791
and says that he is the
champion becomes just that!

204
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:01,291
Huh?

205
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:05,916
So, which fighter can stand up
first and declare victory?

206
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:12,708
All you gotta do is
stand up Goku!

207
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:16,791
[ANNOUNCER] Here comes Goku...!
He's on one knee!

208
00:15:22,916 --> 00:15:24,916
[ANNOUNCER]
Goku is up on both legs...!

209
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,208
And Jackie Chun is
still glued to the floor...!

210
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:30,583
All Goku has to do now
is say he's the champion!

211
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:48,750
I... I... am... the...
cham... pi...

212
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:56,500
[ANNOUNCER] Oh!

213
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:59,541
Goku was a mere syllable
away from winning it all!

214
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:03,583
But I'm afraid we can't
accept incomplete sentences!

215
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:04,666
Oh look!

216
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:07,750
Now Jackie Chun
will give talking a try!

217
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:17,500
I'm the world champion!!

218
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:19,750
I'm the world champion!

219
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:27,916
Yes, I am the champion!!
Hahahahahahaha!

220
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:32,541
[ANNOUNCER] Well I couldn't
have said it better myself!

221
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:37,583
Jackie Chun is the new
Champion of the World...!

222
00:16:37,666 --> 00:16:40,833
And this time I'm certain of it!

223
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:45,750
[CHUN thinking]
That was a close one, Goku...

224
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:49,916
And I must admit my victory
was only due to our sizes...

225
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,375
My legs are longer,

226
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:55,333
so I could hit much deeper
on that last flying kick...

227
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:59,166
Sort of a cheap trick,
but it was my only chance...

228
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:02,166
And it was for your own good.

229
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:06,750
Maybe you'll thank me someday,
when you're older...

230
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:10,291
[ANNOUNCER] What a long
and crazy day it's been!

231
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:11,583
Hasn't it, folks!

232
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:17,791
Oh... Hey...
Did I win it Mr. Jackie?

233
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:19,583
No son, you didn't.

234
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:23,666
Oh... darn... I really tried...

235
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:29,041
[ANNOUNCER] Let's not forget
the twelve year-old Goku

236
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:31,333
who almost won
the whole tournament!

237
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:34,458
Wasn't he incredible?!
Wasn't he, folks?!

238
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:38,833
[ANNOUNCER] Now...!

239
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:40,416
Without further ado,

240
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:44,958
let's award Jackie Chun with his
prize as the new World Champion!

241
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:53,083
And you deserve every bit of it!

242
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:55,041
500 thousand zeni!

243
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,875
You were really
strong Mr. Jackie!

244
00:18:00,958 --> 00:18:03,666
Yes... well you were
a worthy opponent.

245
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:06,458
I'm going to train every day
until I get as strong as you...!

246
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:09,250
And when I do will
you fight me again?

247
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:11,833
Yes... uh... of course...

248
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:13,416
You cross your heart?

249
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,791
Uhhh... Mm-hmm.

250
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:17,750
[ANNOUNCER]
Ladies and Gentlemen,

251
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:19,541
I hope you enjoyed
the tournament!

252
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:21,375
Please fly safely
on your way home

253
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:23,750
and watch out
for stray dinosaurs!

254
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:25,833
Great job Goku!

255
00:18:25,916 --> 00:18:27,416
[GOKU sighs]
Yeah...

256
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,916
[KRILLIN] You wanna find Master
Roshi and get something to eat?!

257
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,875
[GOKU] Hey you bet I do!

258
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:34,958
[KRILLIN] Master Roshi!

259
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:36,375
[GOKU] Master Roshi!

260
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:39,083
[CHUN]
Huh?

261
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:52,375
[ROSHI] I go through
so much for my students...

262
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:58,125
[ROSHI] And what do
I have to show for it?

263
00:18:58,791 --> 00:19:01,916
Nothing except a
truckload of prize money...!

264
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,208
I'm very selfless...

265
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:10,333
[ROSHI thinking]
500 thousand zeni...

266
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:13,208
Just imagine the
possibilities...

267
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:26,833
Uhhhhh.... Wha...? Uhh...

268
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:33,375
[ROSHI] Do you have a tissue?

269
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:35,958
I'm so hungry...

270
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:38,250
I've looked through
every bathroom stall

271
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:39,625
in a seven-mile radius...

272
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:40,750
[YAMCHA] Where is he?

273
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:42,791
Did... you try the lady's room?

274
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:45,583
I wonder if he even watched
Goku in the tournament?

275
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:48,291
Hu...ngry...!

276
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:51,083
[ROSHI] Yoo-hoo!

277
00:19:51,583 --> 00:19:53,166
Master Roshi!

278
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:55,666
Okay, where in the
world have you been?

279
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,583
I wanted an autograph
from Jackie Chun,

280
00:19:57,666 --> 00:20:00,166
and you wouldn't believe
how long the line was!

281
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:01,333
[KRILLIN] So did you see us

282
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:03,250
in the tournament finals,
Master Roshi?

283
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:04,708
Well of course...!

284
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:07,750
And you boys both did very
well for your first attempt!

285
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:10,041
Goku got robbed at the end...

286
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:12,750
He would've won if he
hadn't been so hungry!

287
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:14,458
[GOKU] I don't know
about that, Krillin.

288
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:16,000
Jackie was pretty strong...!

289
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:18,083
I still don't think
I could've beat him!

290
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:20,750
[ROSHI] That's for sure!

291
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:23,500
You've got lots to learn before
you're up to his level...!

292
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:26,083
And plenty of others
are just as strong...!

293
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:28,708
There's a whole dimension of
fighting techniques that YOU...

294
00:20:28,791 --> 00:20:30,333
don't know yet...

295
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:32,708
[ROSHI] All training so
far has been child's play...

296
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:34,583
The real stuff is yet to come!

297
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:35,958
[BOTH] Right!

298
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:38,416
[ROSHI thinking] I should start

299
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:41,083
recording my
speeches and sell them...

300
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:44,291
Now what do you say we
all go out to dinner

301
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:46,666
and celebrate our first
successful tournament!

302
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:48,375
[GOKU] Ooh! Can we really??

303
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:51,041
Would you four like
to come with us?

304
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:52,375
Sure!

305
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:53,583
Oh, yeah!!

306
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:55,208
Alright, but if you
make one crude remark

307
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:57,375
I swear I'll break your arm.

308
00:20:57,458 --> 00:21:00,000
[GOKU] Hey! Hey!
Can we eat now?!

309
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:20,416
[rapid eating sounds]

310
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:46,833
Can I get some pepper?

311
00:21:46,916 --> 00:21:48,333
Yeah...

312
00:21:56,208 --> 00:21:58,250
[GOKU] I sure was hungry!

313
00:21:58,333 --> 00:22:01,458
He... just ate 57
full-course meals...!

314
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:04,375
Really...? I lost count
around forty...

315
00:22:04,875 --> 00:22:06,833
Can I have another
bowl please?

316
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,916
I think you've had
enough for one day...

317
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,666
Yeah... You're right...

318
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,625
I should probably
save room for desert!

319
00:22:24,916 --> 00:22:28,291
It's... four hundred and
seventy thousand zeni, sir.

320
00:22:29,041 --> 00:22:33,208
But... that's all my...
prize... money!
