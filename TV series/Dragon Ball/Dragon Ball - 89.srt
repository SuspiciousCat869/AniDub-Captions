[NARRATOR]
Previously on Dragon Ball,

2
00:02:15,583 --> 00:02:18,000
Yamcha faced Tien
as the Quarterfinals

3
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:20,000
of the Martial Arts
Tournament continued

4
00:02:20,083 --> 00:02:23,541
with a breathtaking display
of fighting prowess.

5
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:27,791
[NARRATOR] Tien, star pupil
of Master Roshi's rival,

6
00:02:27,875 --> 00:02:30,916
Master Shen, seemed
an equal match for Yamcha

7
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,208
as they battled one
another with unbridled fury.

8
00:02:39,416 --> 00:02:40,541
[PUAR] Block, Yamcha!

9
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:42,541
--[PUAR] Punch him out!
--[BULMA] Hit! Hit!

10
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:45,291
[BULMA] Hit! I said hit!

11
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:50,625
[YAMCHA] Hyaaaaaahh!

12
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:55,666
[NARRATOR] It appeared as
if Yamcha was destined to win

13
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:59,916
until Tien broke his spirit...
and his leg.

14
00:03:00,916 --> 00:03:03,166
[NARRATOR] Tien Shinhan
was declared the victor

15
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,958
and Yamcha was
rushed to the hospital.

16
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,833
[NARRATOR] And now,
the match between Jackie Chun

17
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:15,000
and Man Wolf is about to begin.

18
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:18,125
Things could get hairy,
so stay tuned!

19

[CROWD cheers]

20
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:51,875
[SASNAKRA] Alright,

21
00:03:51,958 --> 00:03:55,250
versus Jackie Chun.
And accordin' to this here map,

22
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:57,333
they're pretty big fellas.

23
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:59,333
I think you're holding
it upside down there.

24
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:01,541
Fancy letters.

25
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:03,541
Hey! Look over there!

26
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:06,125
Isn't that one of the finalists?

27
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:08,333
Tarnation! That's Pamput.

28
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:13,416
My momma said he's a distant
cousin on my Uncle Roy's side.

29
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,041
He's cute.

30
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:15,875
Ooooo...

[SUZZI] Here comes Tien!

32
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,125
Aren't his dark
eyes just gorgeous?

33
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:22,541
[BARBARA]
Yeah, all three of them.

34
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:27,583
Girls, we have to
get some autographs.

35
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:28,916
Mhmmm.

36
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,916
I can't hold it!
Oh boy! Uhhhh...

37
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:35,708
Huh?

38

[GOKU] Could you point me
to the nearest bathroom...

39

[GOKU]
Thanks, bye!

41

Well, when you gotta go...

42
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:46,750
...you gotta go.

How dare he mock me?

51
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:28,333
I hate nose... hair!

52
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:30,666
The things I do
to look handsome!

53
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,958
[CHUN] I'm hairier now
than when I started.

54
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:39,875
Maybe I should try
using a stronger facial cream.

55
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:43,375
Where's Jackie Chun?
Ah, you have some fans.

56
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:46,041
They obviously forgot
I was hosting the event.

Hi, it's a pleasure to be
in touch with today's youth.

Oh, how horrible!

67
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:08,541
It's a monster!

68
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:10,083
It might be like, someone's pet

69
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:12,750
or, like, an exotic animal that,
like, escaped from the zoo.

70
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:14,375
Maybe it has, like, a name.

71
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:15,916
Ask.

72
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,333

Gee, you're tall...

81
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:38,666

real or is it just a tattoo?

You must be little Tien Jr.!

if it's the last thing I do.

86
00:06:47,958 --> 00:06:50,000
This is all your fault!

Easy there, big fella.

Wouldn't want ya
to cough up a fur ball.

Why don't you come with me?

I know a great manicurist who
can help you with those claws.

[MAN WOLF] I'll see you later!

94

Interesting...

00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:11,083

hates Jackie Chun so much?

Yamcha, does it hurt to walk?

No, not really. Thanks to you.

[ANNOUNCER] It's time for
Match two of the Quarterfinals,

111
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:10,625
and the moment you've
all been waiting for:

112
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:13,875
The return of defending
Champion Jackie Chun

113
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:18,208
as he takes on the
Wolf-Man... Wolf!

Sorry about that,
man... Man Wolf.

Ha ha! All right!

Anyway, is everyone
in the audience ready

117
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:27,666
for some hair-raising action?!

118
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:31,083
I've been waitng for this
moment a very long time, Chun!

119
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:34,541
A punch for every day
I've been waiting!

120
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:37,000
You must be confusing
me for someone else.

121
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:39,625
There's no possible reason
for you to hate me,

122
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:42,041
considering we've
never even met before.

You fool! Don't insult me!

124
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:45,541
Do you expect me to
believe you don't remember

125
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:48,625
what you did in this very
ring just three years ago?!

Three years ago?

Aw... Poor Chun.

What fun.

129
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:06,083
Maybe he really, really
wanted the title last time

130
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:08,625
and he's mad at Jackie
for winning the tournament.

131
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:10,500
Mm-hmm. Great!

they're up to something,

so interested in this fight?

137

We'd better keep a
close eye on those two.

Here, Chun, let me
jog your memory!

Sorry, I'm still
drawing a blank. Unless--

140

Stop pretending!

incident at that party,

I can assure you it
was an innocent mistake.

I go to parties?!

She didn't tell me
she was involved.

145

But then again, we, uh...

146
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:01,291
...didn't... really... talk...

147
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,541
This isn't about a party!

ruined my life! Think back!

When Goku changes like that,

164
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:27,958
he loses all sense of himself!

165
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:33,000
Well then, I'm afraid
there's only one way

166
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:34,791
to take care of this!

167
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:36,750
Ah!

168
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:40,416
Okay, beast...

169
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:49,208
...I can't let you hurt people!

[MAN WOLF yells]

173
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:09,583
[TIEN] And that's why Man Wolf
hates Jackie Chun so much.

174
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:12,125
I'm surprised Jackie
has any friends at all.

175
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:13,375
Thanks to him,

176
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:15,750
we'll never be able to
enjoy the moon again...

177
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:19,000
Now Man Wolf must
be a wolf forever.

178
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:21,125
[TIEN] Mm-hmm.

179
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,208
I was a man...
Handsome... Adored...!

180
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:33,666
Now I'm the
laughingstock of nature!

181
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,625
All because of you!

182
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:39,833
[KRILLIN] Hmm?

183
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:45,750
People... People used to
shower me with praises...

184
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:49,000
Now I'm lucky if they
give me a dog biscuit!

185
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:53,375
Do you know how that feels?!

186
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:55,875
Well, uh... no...?

187
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:12,958
Moon...

188
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:15,083
You destroyed the moon...

189
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:19,083
Oh yes, of course...
So, uh, what did it cost you?

190
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:22,041
Countless insults.
"What a horrible beast!"

191
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:24,291
"Quick, look away!
Don't make eye contact."

192
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:28,541
The indignation!
No one understands.

193
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:30,208
I can't imagine why.

194
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:32,958
Now that you're done sharing
your feelings, can we fight?

195
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:36,291
You took away the moon
and robbed me of my humanity!

196
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:38,625
I think I deserve some
of your precious... time!

197
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:41,000
But it's hard to stay awake.

[yawns]

Come and get me when you're
ready to fight. [yawns]

200
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,208
Big mistake!

201
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:50,541
I don't know about you,

202
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:53,083
but I wouldn't be turnin'
my back on that critter.

203
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,041
Old Chun is done...

204
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:57,208
Huh?

205
00:13:57,291 --> 00:13:59,666
I sure am glad we're
watching this live.

206
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:02,208
They never show nothin'
like this on T.V.!

207
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:05,708
[growls] Finally
I will have my revenge!

208

[yawns]

209
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:09,875
[KRILLIN]
Jackie's gonna get ambushed!

210
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:11,166
Nope.

211
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:17,125
Where is he? Jackie?

212
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:18,375
Turn around.

213
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:19,416
[MAN WOLF] Show yourself!

214
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,125
Right here.

215
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:22,291
Ah!

216
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:23,500
[CHUN] Hyup!

217
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:25,500
[MAN WOLF] Why you...

218
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:31,583

[shocked gasps in crowd]

[KRILLIN chuckles]

221
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:48,583
You seem angry...

222
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:50,833
You should try to relax a bit.

223
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:53,708
Jackie Chun's one of
the best fighters ever.

224
00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:57,166
I hope that I can achieve
his level of skill someday.

225
00:14:58,083 --> 00:14:59,833
[TIEN] Given that
I can't view myself,

226
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:03,583
it's rare I see such
exceptional ability in the ring.

227
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:06,125
Jackie Chun is as close
to perfect as is possible

228
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:07,416
without being me.

229
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,625
He will be a worthy adversary.

230
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:13,166
He doesn't stand a chance.

231
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:16,458
Of course... But he'll try.

232
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:20,166
His strength is matched
only by his control,

233
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:22,875
the mark of a great warrior...

234
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:26,125
It's going to be an
immense honor to break him.

235
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:34,041
Stand still!

236
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:36,666
Seems I should give
you the same advice.

237
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:39,625
The more you move,
the more you hurt yourself.

238
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:41,458
I'm not clumsy!

239
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:42,916
Do you hear me?!

240
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,583
I have a black belt to prove it!

241
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:46,208
Not to mention the
time I spent touring

242
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:48,458
with an ice skating revue!

243
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:52,833
Ah! Look at all those people!

244

I didn't know
I had so many fans.

[CHUN] And I think
someone's even waving at you!

Nope! It's just a vendor
selling my t-shirts.

gonna stay down, do you?

Uh, nope.

off that easy!

but you won't
rob me of my revenge!

[CHUN] You tried fighting me.

00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:33,583
That didn't work. What next?

263
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:34,916
Are you going to try to slay me

with more of your
witless banter?

Not quite! I'll just use
this big, sharp knife!

It is a violation
of tournament policy

269
00:17:46,541 --> 00:17:48,583
to bring weapons
onto the premises.

I don't care about
the tournament.

I'm here to make you pay!

Well then, why don't you quit
whining and get this over with.

[CROWD gasps]

You don't need a knife to bring
attention to your discomfort.

Uh, what are you saying?

What?! You agree with me?

but I want you to
calm down and play nice.

He's cool.

307

He certainly thinks
of everything,

308
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:03,875
but how can he change a wolf
into a man without the moon?

[KRILLIN] Hm?

314
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:21,375
Now focus on Krillin's head.

315
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:27,166
Since I doubt you called me
out here to work on my tan,

316
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:29,541
I assume my head is
stand-in for the moon?

[CHUN] Mhmm.
That's the plan, boy.

[KRILLIN] I'm happy
to help out, Jackie.

But if my head could turn
lunar we'd all be in trouble.

320

It would turn Goku
back into a monster.

321
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:42,208
Your head won't
work on its own,

322
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:45,166
but under hypnosis,
it should fool him.

323
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,875
[CHUN] Clear your mind
and focus on Krillin's head.

324
00:20:53,958 --> 00:20:56,041
Ohhhh...

325
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:03,166
Watch as it changes
into a full moon!

326
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:05,041
All of your thoughts
are transfixed

327
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:07,916
upon its brilliant glow.

328
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,041
[CHUN] Feel its power
course through your veins

329
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:16,750
as it separates
beast from man...

330
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:20,625
[CHUN] Now change!

331
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:27,083
Uh...

332
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:43,250
[chuckles]
It worked! I'm normal!

333
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:46,125
What some call progress
I'll never understand.

334
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:51,791
Jackie Chun, I don't know how
to thank you, but thank you!

335
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:53,541
Your face says it all.

336
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:58,541
I'm cured! Now I look
like everyone else! Goodbye!

337
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:02,416
Just think of the money
I'll save on shampoo alone!

338
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,750
By his reaction,

339
00:22:03,833 --> 00:22:05,958
I guess there are no mirrors
where he comes from.

340
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:08,583
Yeah, but maybe he'd
look better with a beard.

341
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:13,666
[ANNOUNCER]
A wolf changing into a man.

342
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:15,208
You saw it here first, folks!

343
00:22:15,291 --> 00:22:18,083
Who said we never
try anything new?!

344
00:22:18,166 --> 00:22:20,708
Wishing you good luck
would be pointless.

345
00:22:20,791 --> 00:22:22,166
Huh?

346
00:22:29,666 --> 00:22:31,125
Get going.

347
00:22:32,708 --> 00:22:36,125
The third match is about
to begin as Chiaotzu faces off

348
00:22:36,208 --> 00:22:39,416
against our very
own moon boy, Krillin!

349
00:22:40,833 --> 00:22:43,916
[NARRATOR] What power dwells
within the mysterious Chiaotzu,

350
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,666
and will Krillin be strong
enough to stand his ground

351
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:48,958
against this pint-sized menace?!

352
00:22:49,041 --> 00:22:50,875
The answers lie just ahead,

353
00:22:50,958 --> 00:22:54,375
on the next incredible
episode of Dragon Ball!
