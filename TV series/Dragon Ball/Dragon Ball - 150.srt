[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball,

2
00:02:13,583 --> 00:02:17,583
Goku's fiancée, ChiChi received
a wedding dress from her father,

3
00:02:17,666 --> 00:02:18,958
the Ox King.

4
00:02:19,041 --> 00:02:22,083
ChiChi was honored to
accept the family heirloom.

5
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:25,791
Unfortunately, the happy
moment didn't last long,

6
00:02:25,875 --> 00:02:30,125
as the Ox King's castle was
devastated by violent tremors.

7
00:02:32,125 --> 00:02:34,916
[OX KING] I'll get the dress!
Goku, take ChiChi to safety.

8
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,125
[NARRATOR] Sheets of fire
erupted from the ground,

9
00:02:37,208 --> 00:02:39,458
enveloping the castle in flames.

10
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:42,291
At the desperate request of
his future father-in-law,

11
00:02:42,375 --> 00:02:45,125
Goku set out
to find the Bansho fan,

12
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:49,875
a powerful instrument able to
extinguish the raging blaze.

13
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:52,083
Fortuneteller Baba used
her crystal ball

14
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:53,541
to aid in the search,

15
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:56,666
learning the fan's location
was linked to an octagon.

16
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,791
Goku drained a pond
matching the shape

17
00:02:58,875 --> 00:03:01,458
and discovered a pillar
covered in symbols,

18
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:05,250
similar to those found on a
poster owned by Master Roshi.

19
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:10,791
[NARRATOR] Goku and ChiChi
raced to Roshi's island,

20
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:15,500
but time was running out for
the Ox King and his kingdom.

21
00:03:25,583 --> 00:03:27,583
[MAI]
Can you see anything?

22
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:30,916
[SHU] I see three rocks
that look like a face! Neat!

23
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,750
[MAI]
Shu!

24
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:34,833
[SHU humming]

25
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:36,791
[SHU]
Uh! There he is. I've got him!

26
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:38,916
Nice outfit. Ha.

27
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:44,958
We have proof.
The rumors were true.

28
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:04,791
The king is trapped!

29
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:06,583
Isn't there anything we can do?

30
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:08,166
Afraid not.

31
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:11,583
A rescue attempt is impossible
unless we control those flames.

32
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:25,791
[TURTLE humming]

33
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:32,791
Huh?

34
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:38,750
Hello there. I'm back!

35
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:43,833
That's nice... Who are you?

36
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:45,125
Goku.

37
00:04:46,416 --> 00:04:47,666
[GOKU]
Don't you recognize me?

38
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:56,875
[TURTLE]
Uh... Uh...

39
00:04:56,958 --> 00:05:00,250
Oh, Goku! It's really you!

40
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:02,458
I have changed a little.

41
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:06,291
That's an understatement.
Who's this?

42
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:09,083
I'm Goku's fiancée, ChiChi.

43
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:11,375
Really?

44
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:13,458
Is Roshi here?

45
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:16,291
Not quite. You're the first
one I've seen in a while.

46
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:18,541
He hasn't returned
from the tournament yet.

47
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:20,375
[GOKU, CHICHI gasp]

48
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:22,500
No.

49
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:24,041
[GOKU]
That's right.

50
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:25,916
I didn't think about how long it
would take them to get back.

51
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,666
They're on an airplane.
It could take hours!

52
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:34,916
Can I help you
with something then?

53
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,791
I'm trying to track
down the Bansho fan.

54
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:40,000
Bansho fan! I remember it well.

55
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:43,833
I yelled at Master Roshi
for using it as a coaster.

56
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:46,375
As usual, he never
listened to me.

57
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:50,833
I'm afraid he threw
it away, years ago.

58
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:55,125
I know, I know. It's okay.
We'll make another one.

59
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:56,916
Uh, from scratch?

60
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,458
Yes!

61
00:05:58,541 --> 00:06:00,916
According to his sister, Master
Roshi has the instructions!

62
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,416
If he does, they would be
in his archives in his closet.

63
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,541
But I've never heard
him mention 'em.

64
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:08,291
We're running out of time!

65
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:11,458
All right. No need to shout.

66
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,500

No, no. A-ha!

Hmm.

80
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,958
According to this text,

81
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:59,000
the Bansho fan is an
all-purpose tool

82
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:01,791
that brings about a strong
wind as you fan once,

83
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:06,666
a cloud as you fan twice, and a
downpour as you fan three times.

84
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:09,083
Ingredients are as follows:

85
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:12,333
a... a feather of a Fire-Eater,

86
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:14,416
a mystical bird that
lives at the crater

87
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,583
of Mt. Kiwi, in the south.

88
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:18,333
Fire-Eater?

89
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:19,500
Mh-hm.

Hello, I'm Goku.

00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:27,958
I'm ChiChi.

166

We're trying to find
the Fire-Eater, sir.

167

Where's the bird
that laid this egg?

168
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:34,333
[SCIENTIST]
Nowhere.

00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:39,083

172
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:45,000
[SCIENTIST] It must be forty
years now. Hard to believe.

173
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:47,208
This mountain suffered
a huge eruption.

174
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:49,458
It took the Fire-Eaters
by surprise.

175
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:51,916
There was no time to escape.
They were crushed by

176
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,958
falling rocks while attempting
to find a path to safety.

177
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:59,166
The Fire-Eaters were
glorious creatures.

178
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:04,166
This egg is all that
remains of their legacy.

179
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:09,375
[CHICHI] I can't believe the egg
survived for 40 years.

180
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:12,833
[SCIENTIST] The heat produced by
this volcano has kept it alive.

181
00:14:12,916 --> 00:14:18,291
It is an ironic twist of fate.
It's nothing short of a miracle.

keeps it alive,

185
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:28,083
but there's no telling
if it will ever hatch.

186
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:30,208

[SCIENTIST]
Don't be silly.

200
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:11,875
You can't remove the egg
from its environment.

to make me zillions!

326
00:21:53,916 --> 00:21:56,166
The Fire-Eater lives on flames.

327
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:59,125
If its feathers put them out,
how would it survive?

328
00:21:59,208 --> 00:22:01,000
You have a good point.

329
00:22:01,083 --> 00:22:02,750
[ROSHI]
Nothing in this book works!

330
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:05,125
I couldn't decipher
that crazy code!

331
00:22:05,208 --> 00:22:07,833
I only wrote the book
to impress some girl.

332
00:22:07,916 --> 00:22:08,875
[groans]

333
00:22:08,958 --> 00:22:10,291
--[CHICHI] Hmm.
--[GOKU] Uh?

334
00:22:10,375 --> 00:22:13,083
You were right. We're
back where we started.

335
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:14,791
Bansho fan...

336
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:18,250
Oh, yes! I remember.
I know where it is.

337
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:20,375
--[CHICHI shrieks, laughs]
--You do?

338
00:22:20,458 --> 00:22:22,958
[SCIENTIST] Yes, but finding
it will be a challenge.

339
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:27,000
The Bansho fan is frozen in
an iceberg, far north of here.

340
00:22:27,083 --> 00:22:29,125
[GOKU]
Thank you! Let's go, ChiChi.

341
00:22:29,208 --> 00:22:31,083
[laughs]

342
00:22:33,666 --> 00:22:34,750
[BOTH laughing]

343
00:22:34,833 --> 00:22:36,375
[CHICHI]
Goodbye!

344
00:22:36,458 --> 00:22:38,166
[SCIENTIST thinking]
Kids riding clouds.

345
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:39,541
Now I've seen it all.

346
00:22:39,625 --> 00:22:42,875
Too bad it's a two-seater.
I could use a lift.

347
00:22:42,958 --> 00:22:44,375
[NARRATOR]
With a new clue,

348
00:22:44,458 --> 00:22:48,000
Goku and ChiChi rush north in
search of the Bansho Fan.

349
00:22:48,083 --> 00:22:51,458
Will they find it,
or some other dark peril?

350
00:22:51,541 --> 00:22:55,416
Don't miss the next
episode of Dragon Ball!
