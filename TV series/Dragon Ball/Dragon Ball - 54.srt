[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball:

2
00:02:15,083 --> 00:02:17,750
General Blue bested Goku
by paralyzing him

3
00:02:17,833 --> 00:02:19,166
with his psychic powers.

4
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:21,833
All seemed lost until
a little mouse showed up

5
00:02:21,916 --> 00:02:23,375
to break the spell.

6
00:02:23,458 --> 00:02:26,916
Apparently, the fearless General
doesn't like furry rodents.

[BLUE groans]

10
00:02:33,625 --> 00:02:36,916
[NARRATOR] Goku defeated General
Blue, but it seemed the pirates

11
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,875
would have the last laugh as
the hideout began to collapse.

12
00:02:39,958 --> 00:02:41,833
Yet, the approach
of impending doom

13
00:02:41,916 --> 00:02:46,125
did not deter our hero from
going after the Dragon Ball.

14
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:49,750
Meanwhile, Bulma
and Krillin opted

15
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:53,458
for the safe approach
and ran for their lives.

16
00:02:56,916 --> 00:02:59,208
[NARRATOR]
Goku's search was successful.

17
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:02,333
However, navigating his way
out of the crumbling structure

18
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:04,458
proved extremely difficult.

19
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:06,416
Convinced her friend
could not have escaped,

20
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,416
Bulma decided to
leave without him.

21
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,958
[BULMA]
We barely made it out alive

22
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:13,208
and we were running
as fast as we could.

23
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:15,875
Goku wasn't going to leave
without that Dragon Ball.

Oh... Goku, where are you?!

That was scary, wasn't it?

Quiet! I'm trying
to concentrate!

We're not out of
the water yet. Huh?

[BULMA, KRILLIN, GOKU scream]

52

Is it just my imagination

53
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:33,333
or are the rocks
getting bigger?!

It's blocked!

[KRILLIN]
We're done for!

58
00:05:57,875 --> 00:06:01,708
Uh, hey, maybe we
could go through there.

[BULMA]
Huh? Great eyes, kid!

Perfect! This passage
might lead to the surface!

Hold on, everyone!
We're getting outta here!

[KRILLIN]
Are you sure about this?

63
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:14,166
It looks like a tight fit.

start calling you Mr. Bulma.

Oh, no. Three stars?

I really thought this one was
going to be my grandpa's ball.

That wasn't the one
you were looking for?

No!

148
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:06,625
Are you going to keep
looking for those things

149
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:08,708
until you find the one that
was your grandfather's?

That's right.
I'm not gonna stop.

Fine. But you'll have
to do it without me!

I'm through. No more
crazy adventures!

00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,458
I thought you liked
looking for the Dragon Balls.

Isn't that why you came along?
You sort of invited yourself.

00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:24,458
I wouldn't have if you
had bothered to mention

156

the Red Ribbon Army was
trying to destroy you!

[GOKU]
They weren't that tough.

Look how easy it was
to beat General Blue.

idea of fun, great.

enough to enjoy my diamond.

Yep!

can count that high, Bulma!

Nice to know you're going to do

You know, considering we
almost died trying to get it.

That was just
a theoretical example!

Do you really think
it's worth a whole lot?

Don't be silly! Of course it is.

Well, alright. I was kinda
partial to that submarine.

You're not going to turn around

00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:40,541
and ask for it
back later, are you?

317
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:42,041
I would never do that.

Maybe I should hold onto
it for safe keeping...

That way you won't be tempted
to spend it on something

you might not
really want to buy.

sound financial decisions?!

323
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:54,708
Yes.

324
00:19:54,791 --> 00:19:57,125
[ROSHI] Why you no good--
I'm gonna buy myself--

325
00:19:57,208 --> 00:20:00,041
[BULMA] Come on. There's no
point in arguing about it.

326
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:07,416
She's right, especially since
I'm the one holdin' the gun.

327
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,625
[ALL gasp]

328
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,500
Hand it over before someone...

329
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:12,500
...gets hurt.

330
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:14,291
Uh... Hand over what, Launch?

331
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:16,916
I've already given my
donations this year.

332
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,125
Don't shoot! I surrender.

333
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:20,583
[LAUNCH growls]
Give it!

334
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:22,708
Ah! Okay, okay!

335
00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:24,125
[BULMA] Who is that?
[GOKU] Launch.

336
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:25,458
[LAUNCH]
Thanks.

337
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:26,541
Launch?

338
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:28,708
Yeah. You've met
her before, remember?

339
00:20:28,791 --> 00:20:30,666
But she's nice.

340
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:33,708
[BULMA, GOKU yelping]

341
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:35,708
Hands up and shut up!

342
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,875
[ALL whimpering]

343
00:20:39,958 --> 00:20:42,166
[LAUNCH]
That completes our transaction.

344
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:46,166
[LAUNCH laughs]

345
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:47,291
Later!

346
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:53,541
She's getting away
with the diamond!

347
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:55,291
We've gotta find
a way to stop her!

348
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:57,291
You got a capsule
for that, do ya?

349
00:20:57,375 --> 00:20:59,416
Because if you do,
I'd love to see it.

350
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,541
Don't you have some
kind of 'special powers'

351
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:03,875
or something you can use
to get her back here?!

352
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:06,125
Sorry. It doesn't work that way.

353
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:08,625
If it did, I'd be the
luckiest man alive.

354
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:10,500
So that's it?
We just give up?

355
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:11,708
Not at all.

356
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:13,375
We just have to wait
for her to sneeze again.

357
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:15,125
She'll change back
into the nice Launch

358
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:16,750
and bring the diamond back!

359
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:24,166
The brat's base
must be somewhere

360
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:26,041
in the vicinity.

361
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:34,541
[BLUE]
Ah ha! There you are!

362
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:41,375
[BLUE cackles]
Time to take the Dragon Balls,

363
00:21:41,458 --> 00:21:44,416
just as soon as I
have taken my revenge!

364
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,333
[BLUE yells]

365
00:21:50,041 --> 00:21:54,166
[BLUE yelling]

366
00:21:56,041 --> 00:22:00,208
[BLUE growling]

367
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:05,000
[BLUE growls]

368
00:22:06,416 --> 00:22:08,958
[BLUE yells]

369
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:11,708
[ROSHI] Right. She'll be
back, next millenium!

370
00:22:11,791 --> 00:22:13,500
[BULMA]
It's hopeless.

371
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:16,125
Nooo! That diamond
is mine! I want it!

372
00:22:16,208 --> 00:22:18,083
Bring it back! It's not fair!

373
00:22:18,166 --> 00:22:20,291
Master, please!
Control yourself!

374
00:22:20,375 --> 00:22:23,291
It's okay, Master, I'll go
get you another one.

375
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:25,291
No! That's impossible!

376
00:22:25,375 --> 00:22:29,458
[BLUE cackles]
There's no need to get so upset.

377
00:22:29,541 --> 00:22:33,458
Life is too short. Well,
at least yours is anyway.

378
00:22:37,125 --> 00:22:39,166
[NARRATOR] What sinister
scheme does the General

379
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:41,791
have in store for Goku
and his friends?

380
00:22:41,875 --> 00:22:44,625
Beware the chilling
wrath of General Blue

381
00:22:44,708 --> 00:22:48,791
on the next unbelievable
episode of Dragon Ball!
