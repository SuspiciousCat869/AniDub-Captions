say that Goku's weak

That was quite a

get us into, huh?

Yeah, but if he hadn't
changed into that monster

we would have all been
barbecued in Pilaf's cell!

him that he stomped his

just break his little heart.

separate ways, huh?

Bulma? Let me see...

330
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:47,041
[BULMA] Yeah, a
little, but it's okay...

331
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:48,958
I feel fine now...

332
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:52,375
[BULMA] You saved
my life, remember?

333
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:54,916
Uhm, ahem!

334
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,458
I don't mean to
interrupt you guys, but um...

335
00:19:58,166 --> 00:19:59,750
[YAMCHA laughing]

336
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:02,083
I think Yamcha and I've
decided that we'd like to

337
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:03,666
spend a little
more time together...

338
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,125
[YAMCHA laughing]

339
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:07,750
So, why don't we all
go back to the city?

340
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:09,166
Pretty cool idea, huh?

341
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,083
That sounds good.
But I think I'm gonna go to

342
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:13,458
Master Roshi's and
train like my Grandpa did.

343
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:15,166
I wanna get strong!

344
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:17,625
But Goku, you're the
strongest kid I know...

345
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:20,916
Yeah, but when I hit that
castle it didn't even shake!

346
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,250
So if someone else can come
along and tear the whole

347
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:25,791
thing down, I really
need to go and train!

348
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:27,375
What are you
talking about, Goku?

349
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:30,166
You're the one
who destr-mmmph!

350
00:20:31,916 --> 00:20:33,708
We'll miss you, Goku...

351
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:35,291
And what about you, Oolong?

352
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:36,458
Well, I dunno.

353
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:38,666
Do you think I look
like a big city pig?

354
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:41,833
Are you kidding?
You'll be the talk of the town!

355
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:43,875
Especially with that
underwear on your head!

356
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:46,708
You're just jealous 'coz I
got these from the dragon!

357
00:20:46,791 --> 00:20:49,375
[laughing]

358
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:51,541
Oh well,
I guess I'll go...

359
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,083
You guys need me!

360
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:54,666
I know!

361
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,625
When a year goes by, let's go
look for the Dragon Balls again!

362
00:20:57,166 --> 00:20:59,625
[BULMA] We don't need the
Dragon Balls anymore, Goku!

363
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:01,541
[laughter]

364
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:03,625
[OOLONG spitting]

365
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,375
Despicable!

366
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:08,458
Hey, how will I ever be
able to find my Grandpa's Dragon

367
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:11,750
Ball if you're not there
with your radar, Bulma?

368
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:13,458
Well, I'll tell you what, kid.

369
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:16,416
How about I just give you this
radar as a going away present,

370
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:19,583
to remind you of all the good
times that we had together.

371
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:20,958
Oh wow, thank you.

372
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:33,666
Well, here goes.

373
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:40,416
[YAMCHA] I guess this
is goodbye, Goku...

374
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:43,791
I want you to become just as
strong as Master Roshi, okay?

375
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:44,916
Okay.

376
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,750
You know I'll never
forget you, Goku.

377
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:48,500
Aww.

378
00:21:49,416 --> 00:21:50,875
Flying Nimbus!

379
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:53,666
Hey-hey!

380
00:21:56,416 --> 00:21:59,291
All right, Nimbus, to
Master Roshi's, and step on it!

381
00:22:00,541 --> 00:22:01,958
You go get 'em, kid!

382
00:22:02,041 --> 00:22:03,250
You too, Oolong!

383
00:22:03,666 --> 00:22:04,916
[YAMCHA] Hold on, everyone!

384
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:19,250
[GOKU laughing]

385
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:20,625
[GOKU] Yeah!

386
00:22:20,708 --> 00:22:21,750
[GOKU laughing]

387
00:22:21,833 --> 00:22:23,208
[ALL] Buh-bye!

388
00:22:24,666 --> 00:22:26,041
[GOKU] Bye! See ya!

389
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,875
I never thought that life
could be such a neat adventure!

390
00:22:32,958 --> 00:22:34,666
[GOKU laughing]

391
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:35,958
Go!

392
00:22:37,583 --> 00:22:40,000
[NARRATOR] Soon, Goku's skills
will be put to the test when he

393
00:22:40,083 --> 00:22:43,583
joins Master Roshi and begins
the rigors of Turtle Hermit

394
00:22:43,666 --> 00:22:47,541
Training! But what other
challenges await our young hero?

395
00:22:47,625 --> 00:22:50,708
[NARRATOR] A new day dawns,
and a new adventure begins,

396
00:22:50,791 --> 00:22:53,041
next time on Dragon Ball!
