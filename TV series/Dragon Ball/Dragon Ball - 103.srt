[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball,

2
00:02:13,375 --> 00:02:15,833
the Martial Arts Tournament
ended in tragedy

3
00:02:15,916 --> 00:02:19,958
when Krillin was found slain
by a mysterious attacker.

4
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:21,666
Described as a monster,

5
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:25,166
the culprit stole
Goku's Four-Star Dragon Ball

6
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:28,250
and a list of members
of the Martial Arts Society.

7
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:29,833
Krillin didn't deserve this!

8
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:33,250
[NARRATOR] Enraged and consumed
by his thirst for revenge,

9
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:37,458
Goku left the others in search
of his friend's killer.

10
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:39,750
[NARRATOR]
Meanwhile,

11
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:41,583
Master Roshi uncovered
startling evidence,

12
00:02:41,666 --> 00:02:45,500
which identified the murderous
fiend as King Piccolo,

13
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:48,583
a ruthless alien bent on
finding the Dragon Balls

14
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:51,708
and conquering the world.

15
00:02:51,791 --> 00:02:53,208
Using the Dragon Radar,

16
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:57,041
Goku tracked down the killer
and rushed to attack.

17
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,125
[GOKU]
Stop!

18
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:30,208
[TAMBOURINE]
Hmm?

19
00:03:30,291 --> 00:03:34,083
[GOKU growls]

20
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:39,291
Hey you, stop!

21
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:42,000
[growls]

22
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:53,375
[growls]

23
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,291
A child? Explain.

24
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:12,541
[GOKU]
It was you!

25
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:15,250
You killed my friend!

26
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:17,250
Your point?

27
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:23,541
He was my best friend,
a great warrior!

28
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:25,291
His name was Krillin!

29
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:26,708
Krillin?

30
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:29,458
He fought you for the
Dragon Ball and you killed him!

31
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:34,500
Ah, yes. I have never seen
anyone so bald act so brave.

32
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:49,250
[ANNOUNCER whimpers]
There's a big green monster

33
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:52,583
hanging from the ceiling!

34
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:57,583
This is the last time
I ever pull a double shift!

35
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:04,083
[KRILLIN growls]

36
00:05:06,416 --> 00:05:07,833
Huh?!

37
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:14,833
[TAMBOURINE chuckles]

38
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:27,583
[KRILLIN thinking] Whatever
that thing is, it's fast.

39
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:30,166
[KRILLIN growls]

40
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:40,583
That's it? Pathetic.

41
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:42,375
You're not taking that ball!

42
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:46,833
Aaahh!

43
00:05:46,916 --> 00:05:48,791
Where'd he go?! Huh?

44
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:50,583
[TAMBOURINE]
Up here!

45
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:02,458
Ahh! Somebody help me!

46
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:22,666
[chuckles] Dead.
Thanks for the update.

47
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:25,208
He was human. I did him a favor.

48
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:26,666
[GOKU]
What did you say?!

49
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:29,125
Taking his life
was a big mistake.

50
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:32,333
Nobody messes with my friends!

51
00:06:32,416 --> 00:06:36,708
One thing I find tolerable
about your species, barely...

52
00:06:36,791 --> 00:06:38,166
[slurp]

53
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:41,375
...is the sound you
make when you die.

54
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:48,541
What's wrong?
Did I make you cry?

55
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:56,291
Your bodies are
soft and fragile,

56
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:59,125
hardly suitable for fighting.

57
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:02,333
[TAMBOURINE]
But perfect for pain!

58
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:19,666
[ROSHI]
Hmm...

59
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:24,500
One kick, to the frontal lobe.
That's what killed him.

60
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:25,916
--[YAMCHA] Are you sure?
--[BULMA gasps]

61
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,791
Someone with Krillin's strength,
killed with one kick?!

62
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,166
It happens.

63
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:35,458
Krillin...

64
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:43,625
Ni-Ni-Nimbus.

65
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:48,958
[GOKU] Oof!

66
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,166
I'm tired.

67
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:55,583
I must have used up all of
my energy during the tournament.

68
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:58,041
[TAMBOURINE laughs]

69
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:00,333
If your muscles were
as tough as your talk,

70
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:02,416
this wouldn't be so boring.

71
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:05,416
[growls] I'll show you
how strong I can be!

72
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,833
Aaah!

73
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:56,916
[GOKU]
Hyaaaaa!

74
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,583
Auuh...

75
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,375
Really, what do you
hope to accomplish here,

76
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:21,000
other than to prove the fact

77
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:24,125
that your species
deserves extinction?

78
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:25,708
I don't know what you just said,

79
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:28,291
but I'm not here
to prove anything!

80
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:29,750
You're going to pay!

81
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:33,125
Haha! You are a conceited one.

82
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:36,166
I think someone should
take you down a notch.

83
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:47,333
Aahh!

84
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:49,916
The Flying Nimbus!

85
00:09:57,625 --> 00:09:59,625
Power Pole Extend.

86
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:13,375
[TAMBOURINE laughs]

87
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:17,000
Ahhh...

88
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:22,750
[GOKU]Oof!

89
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:26,583
[TAMBOURINE laughs]

90
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:33,041
Unlike other life forms,
humans are worthless.

91
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:36,375
[TAMBOURINE]
They don't even make good pets.

92
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:42,125
Hmm?

93
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:53,583
You killed Krillin.
He was my best friend.

94
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:55,958
Right, got it.

95
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:02,916
I'm going to make you suffer.

96
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,000
Huh?

97
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,750
Ah. That solves that problem!

98
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:53,666
[TAMBOURINE]
I love my job. [laughs]

99
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:23,625
[BULMA] Please come back, Goku.
I can't lose you, too.

100
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:29,750
[BOTH]
Oh...

101
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:31,500
It's all my fault.

102
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:35,083
I should never have
given him the Dragon Radar.

103
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:37,208
[ROSHI]
Don't blame yourself.

104
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:42,500
Goku made his own
choices, as did Krillin.

105
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:45,291
There are no excuses.
It's just fate.

106
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:47,500
[BULMA]
You sound like you've given up.

107
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:51,375
I'm sorry, Goku's gone.

108
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:54,750
It's not true! Shame on you
for saying such a thing!

109
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:56,500
Why do you expect Goku to fail?

110
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:58,625
You should have more
faith in him than that!

111
00:12:58,708 --> 00:12:59,875
That's right!

112
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:03,166
Mhmm. I agree
that there is a chance.

113
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,583
But now we have
to return to the island.

114
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:08,375
We must bury Krillin.
The rest can wait.

115
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:10,000
Grr. I didn't think
I could hate someone

116
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:11,000
I've never met before.

117
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:13,125
But King Piccolo is an animal!

118
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:16,583
Once I'm through with him, he'll
wish he'd stayed in that jar!

119
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:19,416
What's wrong with you?!
You sound like Goku!

120
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,041
This monster is too powerful.

121
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:23,333
You're just gonna
get yourself killed, too!

122
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:26,041
That list he took has
my name on it, Bulma!

123
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:28,833
And I'm not going to sit around
and wait for him to find me!

124
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:30,958
[gasps]

125
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:33,833
You're right! He's only
after people on the list.

126
00:13:33,916 --> 00:13:36,833
I'm safe. No one ever
hunts pigs! We're cute!

127
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:38,208
No, you self-absorbed oinker,

128
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:40,916
you'll end up the main
course at his dinner table!

129
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,500
No one is safe.

130
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:46,958
King Piccolo's ambition
does not allow for bystanders.

131
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:51,541
Should he gain dominion over
our world, all will be lost.

132
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:56,583
[ROSHI] What his nightmarish
flames don't scorch,

133
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:59,250
his legions will devour.

134
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:09,666
[ROSHI] There will be
no quarter, no haven.

135
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:13,666
[ROSHI]
Complete genocide.

136
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:19,708
[laughs]

137
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:29,125
So this Evil Containment
Wave your old master

138
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:31,458
used to trap King Piccolo
the first time around

139
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:33,041
seems like
it worked pretty well.

140
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:34,541
Why don't we use it now?

141
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:36,375
Master Mutaito passed away

142
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:39,625
before he had a
chance to teach it to me.

143
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:41,875
Oh, I see.

144
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:43,416
Excuse me,

145
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,416
but it seems clear this is a
matter for the police to handle.

146
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,333
Yes, under normal circumstances.

147
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:51,916
But local law enforcement is ill
equipped to handle this crisis.

148
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,625
Uh, then who?

149
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:55,833
[ROSHI] It's up to us.

150
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:58,125
As Tien pointed out,
he's been defeated once.

151
00:14:58,208 --> 00:14:59,500
He's not invincible.

152
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:03,208
If Goku comes this way,
tell him we've gone home.

153
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:04,375
I understand.

154
00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:06,375
I think that if anyone
here can save us,

155
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:08,833
I strongly feel it's all of you.

156
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:10,583
[ROSHI]
Hmm...

157
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:20,625
[sniffles]

158
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:25,708
I took it for granted
he'd always be here.

159
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:30,291
[TIEN]
Master Roshi?

160
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:31,541
Hmm?

161
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:33,333
Chiaotzu and
I have talked it over

162
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:35,708
and we'd like to come
with you, if that's alright.

163
00:15:35,791 --> 00:15:37,750
[ROSHI] Don't be silly.
Of course you can.

164
00:15:37,833 --> 00:15:40,000
We'd appreciate your assistance.

165
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:42,916
Oh, I cannot believe
this is happening to me.

166
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,666
Suddenly my whole world's dark.

167
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:47,666
It's happening to
all of us, so stuff it!

168
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:02,291
Tiny... You're sure
it's a Dragon Ball?

169
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:06,250
Yes, it was exactly
where they said it would be.

170
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:13,041
Yes, I was right, you see. Do I
not offer invaluable counsel?

171
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:15,625
[PICCOLO]
Hmmm...

172
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:18,541
You've done well, Pilaf.

173
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:21,125
Once I have all
seven of these trinkets,

174
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:23,666
eternal youth will be mine.

175
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,708
Ah, ha ha ha ha!

176
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:28,541
Yes, soon we'll all
get what we deserve!

177
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:30,625
My full power will be restored

178
00:16:30,708 --> 00:16:34,083
and I will once
again become invincible!

179
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:37,041
Uh, right, and your
looks will improve as well.

180
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:38,083
Heh heh heh.

181
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:39,333
[PICCOLO]
Hmm?

182
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:40,666
Which will be hard to imagine

183
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,916
considering how
good you look now!

184
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:45,041
You look great.

185
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:47,791
A model of beauty.
Uh, heh heh...

186
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:51,208
There's more. Here is the
list of names for participants

187
00:16:51,291 --> 00:16:53,666
of the Martial Arts Tournament.

188
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,166
By all accounts,

189
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:57,291
it provides an accurate
record of every fighter

190
00:16:57,375 --> 00:16:59,250
over the past 10 years.

191
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:03,041
Hmm... Good,
post them on the wall.

192
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:05,458
[TAMBOURINE]
As you wish.

193
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:14,250
You look tired. I'll take that.

194
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:18,750
[TAMBOURINE hums]

195
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:21,625
Ah hahahahaha!

196
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:24,416
I don't believe it. He's one
of their great fighters?

197
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,000
Hahahaha!

198
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:27,708
You know of this one?

199
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:31,583
Yes. And you won't be
needing his picture any longer.

200
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:33,666
I killed him during the mission.

201
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:36,541
Uh, Emperor. I think you
need to take a look at this.

202
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:38,833
[PILAF]
Hmmm...

203
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:41,916
Ah! No wonder the little
pest was so difficult to defeat.

204
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,166
He won second place

205
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:45,333
in the last two
World Martial Arts Competitions.

206
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:48,041
A worthy opponent for my skills.

207
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:50,291
Don't bother with
his picture either.

208
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:52,166
[gasps]

209
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:55,500
What? He was as
weak as the first one.

210
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:57,166
You killed Goku?!

211
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,875
If that was his name...

212
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:02,541
It was over so fast, there
wasn't time for introductions.

213
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:07,583
If the human I fought
won second place,

214
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:10,500
sir, these fighters will not
pose a significant challenge,

215
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:12,250
I can assure you.

216
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:14,791
Hmm... That may be.

217
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:17,125
Or they could still be
the same cunning warriors

218
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:18,791
that drove back my forces

219
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:21,041
and locked me in
a jar for decades!

220
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:23,125
We have to be absolutely sure.

221
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:24,875
Hunt them down, all of them!

222
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:28,000
Leave not one of them standing.

223
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:29,333
Yes.

224
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:31,208
And once you've
completed that mission,

225
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:32,958
find me the rest
of the Dragon Balls.

226
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:35,333
I'll take over the
world from there.

227
00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:37,125
Hahahaha!

228
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:41,291
Remember, nothing fancy.
Just get the job done.

229
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:42,500
Now go, Tambourine.

230
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:44,833
Send those fighters
straight to oblivion,

231
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:47,291
and anyone else
who gets in your way.

232
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:48,958
Yes.

233
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:54,833
[whispering]

234
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:58,041
Emperor, I'm beginning to doubt
the wisdom of this alliance.

235
00:18:58,125 --> 00:18:59,541
He seems unstable.

236
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:01,708
No matter how much
swampland he gives us,

237
00:19:01,791 --> 00:19:04,000
I don't think this is worth it.

238
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:25,791
[martial art cries]

239
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:46,083
[FIGHTERS] We surrender!
We surrender!

240
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:50,000
Hmmm... That's all for today.

241
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:51,500
[TAMBOURINE]
Teach me!

242
00:19:51,583 --> 00:19:52,708
[CHAPA]
Hm?

243
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:56,291
[TAMOBURINE laughs]
I'm here for my lesson.

244
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:58,458
Who are you, huh?

245
00:19:58,541 --> 00:20:00,041
King Chapa is it true

246
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:03,875
you were once Champion of the
World Martial Arts Tournament?

247
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:06,541
[CHAPA] Yes.
What do you want of me?

248
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:07,833
[TAMBOURINE]
Die!

249
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:09,416
Huh?!

250
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:13,208
King Chapa!

251
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:14,958
I'm fine.

252
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:17,041
[FIGHTERS]
Huh?

253
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:18,750
Challenge accepted.

254
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:22,666
Ha! I'm not here to challenge.
I'm just going to kill you.

255
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:25,750
Ohhh!!

256
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:29,500
[CHAPA] Now let's see how
you fare against eight arms!

257
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:38,166
Eight arms. Is that it?
Here, try a hundred!

258
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:47,666
[FIGHTER A]
King Chapa! No!

259
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:50,333
Wake up! Is he unconscious?!

260
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:51,875
Oh...

261
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:53,666
I think he's...!

262
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:57,000
[sighs] Too easy!

263
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:58,041
[FIGHTER A]
Stop!

264
00:20:58,125 --> 00:20:59,333
[TAMBOURINE]
Hmm?

265
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:01,208
So long as one
of us draws breath,

266
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:04,375
you will not escape
justice, creature!

267
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,416
[laughs]

268
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:12,708
If you insist. Who's next?

269
00:21:15,916 --> 00:21:19,666
[TAMBOURINE cackles loudly]

270
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:36,875
[crowd cheering]

271
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:47,791
Reigning Champion Pamput

272
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:50,541
has knocked his opponent off
his feet and out of the ring!

273
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:54,125
This marks the Champ's
twentieth victory in a row!

274
00:21:55,125 --> 00:21:56,583
Hahahaha!

275
00:21:56,666 --> 00:21:59,041
I love your eyebrows!

276
00:22:03,291 --> 00:22:04,458
[PAMPUT] Huh?

277
00:22:04,541 --> 00:22:07,125
An uninvited guest has
dropped in on Pamput.

278
00:22:07,208 --> 00:22:09,833
And by the looks of him,
I doubt he's friendly!

279
00:22:09,916 --> 00:22:11,833
Hey you! Get down!

280
00:22:11,916 --> 00:22:14,416
Now, you will die.

281
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,041
[laughs]

282
00:22:16,125 --> 00:22:18,083
Listen, pal, for one thing,
get a better costume.

283
00:22:18,166 --> 00:22:19,916
I can practically
see your zipper.

284
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,875
And get off my stage.
I'm the only star here!

285
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:39,666
[laughs]

286
00:22:41,625 --> 00:22:44,000
[NARRATOR] Will Goku recover
from his horrible defeat?

287
00:22:44,083 --> 00:22:47,083
Can anyone stop Tambourine
as he continues his assault

288
00:22:47,166 --> 00:22:50,083
on unsuspecting fighters?
And who is his next target?

289
00:22:50,166 --> 00:22:51,708
Find out all the answers

290

episode of Dragon Ball!
