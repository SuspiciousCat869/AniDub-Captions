[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball,

2
00:02:13,791 --> 00:02:15,750
Hero faced off against Junior

3
00:02:15,833 --> 00:02:18,000
in the second round
of the semi-finals.

4
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:20,500
The importance of
their battle became clear

5
00:02:20,583 --> 00:02:23,791
when Hero revealed
his true identity as Kami,

6
00:02:23,875 --> 00:02:27,208
who had returned to prevent
Junior, his alter ego,

7
00:02:27,291 --> 00:02:29,208
from destroying the world.

8
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:32,125
[PICCOLO JR.] You know
our fates are intertwined.

9
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:34,375
You won't do
anything to hurt me!

10
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:36,958
The humans showed me a way
of getting rid of you

11
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:38,916
without harming myself.

12
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,708
[PICCOLO JR.] Huh? What-What
are you going to do?!

13
00:02:42,791 --> 00:02:46,041
[NARRATOR] Hero unleashed
the Evil Containment Wave,

14
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:49,041
in hopes of capturing
Junior's soul.

15
00:02:51,166 --> 00:02:54,458
[NARRATOR] Hero's plan backfired
when Junior surprised him

16
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:56,375
by reversing the technique.

17
00:02:56,458 --> 00:02:58,458
Ill-prepared for such an attack,

18
00:02:58,541 --> 00:03:01,000
Hero succumbed to
the power of the wave

19
00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:03,208
and was swept into its grasp.

20

[PICCOLO JR. laughs]

21
00:03:07,583 --> 00:03:09,875
[NARRATOR] Kami was able
to release Hero's body

22
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:14,416
and make a final plea to Goku
just before his imprisonment.

but it won't do you any good.

40
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:29,541
Without Kami guiding him, Hero
is just like any other human,

41
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:31,208
a worthless shell.

42
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:33,500
Kami's fate is in my hands now

this bottle for all eternity.

According to Kami,

177
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:34,125
the egg King Piccolo released
contained his entire essence.

178
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:36,583
And Junior hatched
from that egg,

179
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:40,166
so he must be King Piccolo
reincarnated.

180
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:43,125
It's strange, but Junior
seems to possess greater powers

181
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:44,666
than his father.

182

One way or another, I must
find a way to stop him!

So, make it stop.

187
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,166
[ROSHI] I never thought we'd
have to face another Piccolo.

188
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:31,750
No matter what we do,
he always seems to return.

189
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:33,916
But wait, wasn't it
Piccolo who emerged

190
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,041
when Hero was
struck by the wave?

191
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,541
Perhaps it's a trick.

192
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:40,250
What if Junior got ambitious
and captured Piccolo

193
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:42,375
so he could take over as ruler?

194
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:44,791
[GOKU] The person you saw
resembles King Piccolo,

--[gasping]
--[KRILLIN] Who's he?

206
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:13,750
You see, Kami and King Piccolo
were born together as one.

207
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,291
[GOKU]
Piccolo is pure evil.

208
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:26,708
Kami cast him aside, creating
two beings, one good, one evil.

209
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:34,291
They are connected. If one dies,
they both suffer the same fate.

210
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:35,833
That's crazy!

211
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:39,791
That explains it.

212
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:43,625
The Evil Containment Wave, it's
the only thing Kami could use

213
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:47,375
to vanquish Piccolo without
sacrificing himself, anyway.

214
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:48,958
Too bad it backfired.

215
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:52,916
Tien Shinhan, is it possible for
Kami to escape from the bottle?

216
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,833
Could we free him?

217
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,833
If you can remove the cork, yes.

218
00:15:57,916 --> 00:16:01,625
But the only way to get to the
bottle is down Junior's throat.

219
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:05,000
Then it's impossible!

220
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:06,833
It's not like Junior's
just gonna cough it up.

221
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:09,875
He's extraordinarily strong!

222
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:13,625
Krillin's right. Even if
we all fought him together,

223
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:18,125
our combined strength would
be insufficient to stop him.

224
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:22,375
You're forgetting one thing,
Tien, Goku's increased strength.

225
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:24,500
I'll stop Junior. I promise.

226
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:29,250
To bear such a burden,
it's unfair, Goku.

227
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:32,541
But since the Evil
Containment Wave failed,

228
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:34,250
you are our last chance.

229
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:36,416
I think Junior knows
you are a threat,

230
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,500
that's why he's
come to stop you.
