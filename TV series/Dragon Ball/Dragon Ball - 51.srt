[NARRATOR]
Previously on Dragon Ball,

00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:18,791
the search for the
third Dragon Ball led Goku,

3
00:02:18,875 --> 00:02:22,458
Bulma, and Krillin
into an old Pirate's cave!

4
00:02:22,541 --> 00:02:24,250
The only thing more dangerous

5
00:02:24,333 --> 00:02:26,333
than the booby traps
they encountered

6
00:02:26,416 --> 00:02:28,333
was the deadly General Blue,

7
00:02:28,416 --> 00:02:30,541
who was secretly
pursuing the trio!

8
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:34,125
But, as the general soon
learned, not even his own men

9
00:02:34,208 --> 00:02:37,291
were immune to the ingenious
traps the pirates had set

10
00:02:37,375 --> 00:02:41,125
to protect their lair and
the treasures hidden within!

While Goku and the others

fought for dear life, General
Blue met with perils of his own

20
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:11,500
as he found himself in the death
grip of a giant electric eel!

[NARRATOR] For every
danger that was survived,

it seemed that the worst

was behind our heroes, and that
all of the pirates' resources

27
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:33,958
were at their disposal,
something was found

00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:48,125
this secret underwater port
had left behind a guardian --

a titanic, swashbuckling

Wait up!

Nah! It tickled! Silly rock!

[BULMA] I don't believe it!
We're really gonna die!

201
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:34,666
[KRILLIN] Great pep talk,
Bulma! Thanks a lot!

Wow! Check it out!

207
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:56,416
[KRILLIN]
Hey! We were just there!

208
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:00,166
[BULMA] Yeah! Amazing!
This must be the command center

for the whole port!

Gross!

00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:53,958
Gosh! I wish my dad were here
to see this! He'd flip!

220
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:57,583
These old computers are like
priceless antiques to him!

221
00:16:57,666 --> 00:17:01,500
Hey! Maybe I can turn off
ol' Metal-breath from here!

222
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:07,666
How much time are we
talking about here, Bulma?

223
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:10,416
I don't know!
This system's so old!

224
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,416
Can you do it?

225
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,166
Well, my Dad always says:

226
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:16,166
Where there's a will,
there's a way!

[KRILLIN]
What do you want me to do? Jump?

242
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:15,916
[BULMA] Well, yeah!
[KRILLIN] No!

And where the heck
have you been?

[BULMA]
Let's see!

272
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,750
Hmm. Strange!

273
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:07,375
Bulma! I'm worried about Goku!

274
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:09,750
I'm sure he's fine, Krillin!

This whole place could cave in!

00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:20,333
We'd better hurry up!

278
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:22,333
According to the radar,

279
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:24,375
we're practically on top
of the Dragon Ball!

280
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:25,208
Let's go!

[GOKU grunting]

282
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:31,541
[GOKU]
This place is falling apart!

283
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:36,208
It should be right up ahead
just a little bit further!

284
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:39,458
[KRILLIN]
Oh, great! Now what?

285
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:41,541
Which way do we go?

286
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:45,916
[BULMA] It's gotta be
this way, Krillin! Come on!

287
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,041
[KRILLIN]
Whoa!

There!

290
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:52,750
[BULMA]
Good thinking!

291
00:20:54,833 --> 00:21:00,625
[BLUE cackling] This should
spice things up a bit!

292
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:13,250
[GOKU]
Uh, oh! Which way?

293
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:14,250
Hum!

294
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:17,083
Hey! Krillin must
have drawn that!

295
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:18,125
They went this way!

296
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:22,791
[BLUE laughing]

297
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:24,916
[BLUE]
Little naïve twerp!

298
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:33,875
[KRILLIN] If we don't get out
of here soon, we're history!

299
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:35,375
We can't turn back now!

300
00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:36,833
We're too close!

301
00:21:37,958 --> 00:21:39,291
[KRILLIN]
Oh, great!

302
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:41,208
[BULMA]
What are we going to do?

303
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:43,500
[KRILLIN]
Look! Is that a stairwell?

304
00:21:43,583 --> 00:21:46,458
Nope! It's a well well!

305
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:49,750
I hate to say it,
but it's the only way!

306
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:07,750
[BLUE]
What? I have to get wet?

307
00:22:07,833 --> 00:22:10,791
Ew! I swear!

308
00:22:10,875 --> 00:22:14,000
I knew I should have packed my
bikini trunks in my field kit!

309
00:22:16,041 --> 00:22:19,000
Mmm! What a bod!

310
00:22:21,791 --> 00:22:25,500
Bulma! Krillin! Where are you!

311
00:22:29,666 --> 00:22:31,541
[GOKU]
Where could they be?

312
00:22:31,625 --> 00:22:33,375
Bulma's not that fast!

313
00:22:33,458 --> 00:22:35,708
I should have caught up
with them by now!

314
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:42,500
[NARRATOR]
As the dangerous Blue closes in

315
00:22:42,583 --> 00:22:46,541
on his unsuspecting prey, Goku
gets further and further away

316
00:22:46,625 --> 00:22:48,291
with every determined step!

317
00:22:48,375 --> 00:22:50,500
Is there any hope
for his friends?
