[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball,

2
00:02:14,166 --> 00:02:16,416
Krillin opposed Chiaotzu
in the third match

3
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,916
of the quarter-finals.

4
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,291
Yeah, Krillin. Good job!

5
00:02:27,041 --> 00:02:29,250
[NARRATOR] The pair seemed
to be evenly matched

6
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:32,208
until Chiaotzu summoned
the Dodon Ray,

7
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:34,166
a powerful force
of lethal energy,

8
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:37,916
which he unleashed upon
Krillin with reckless abandon.

9
00:02:39,708 --> 00:02:41,666
[CHIAOTZU]
Dodon!

[KRILLIN yelps]

11
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:46,958
[NARRATOR]
Tien made a startling discovery

12
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:49,000
when he learned that
Goku was responsible

13
00:02:49,083 --> 00:02:52,250
for the demise of Tao,
younger brother of Master Shen.

14
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:54,416
The Crane Hermit
plotted his revenge

15
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:57,291
against Goku and his friends,
starting with Krillin,

16
00:02:57,375 --> 00:02:59,416
urging Chiaotzu to
destroy him in the ring.

17

[KRILLIN]
Ka, Me...

18
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:02,791
[NARRATOR]
To counter the Dodon Wave,

19
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:05,916
Krillin decided to try his
hand at the Kamehameha Wave,

20
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,916
much to the dismay of his
peers and Jackie Chun,

21
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,708
who feared Krillin was not
ready for such power.

22
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:13,416
We're about to find out.

[ROSHI growls]
Brash child!

26
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:03,583
The Kamehameha Wave
is a dangerous weapon!

27
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:05,875
You're not ready to use it!

You tellin' me after
that he's still floating!

53

[ROSHI] I must admit I'm
impressed by Krillin's strength.

54
00:05:57,625 --> 00:05:59,250
It has improved a great deal.

55
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:01,625
I wish the same held
true for his patience.

56

If he had bothered to learn
the Kamehameha Wave properly,

57

Chiaotzu would be
dust right now.

of Roshi's was capable

62
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:37,875
of such skill. He dodged
and attacked within seconds.

often that I'm surprised,

64
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:43,166

was that strong.

please keep fighting.

my special technique.

does Chiaotzu have?

him out of the ring.

You can't give up now!

Ha! Your encouragement
is amusing, but futile.

124
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:55,416
Why give the boy false hope?
Chiaotzu will destroy him,

125

but his demise
will be on your hands.

[SHEN] For the death
of my brother, Tao!

127
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:05,375
[SHEN]
Krillin has a strong will.

128
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:07,958
Pity, he would have
made a fine pupil.

129
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:10,500
But he's too
headstrong, impatient.

130
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:12,250
Much like Tao...

131
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:13,916
I tried to train him,

132
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,500
mold his natural
aptitude for combat.

133
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:19,666
But I was too young and
arrogant to temper his ego.

134
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:22,500
He couldn't stand to be
anything less than number one.

135
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:25,333
And he certainly didn't care
for the "I told you so's"

136
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:26,916
of an older brother.

137
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,541
I should have treated him more
like a student than a friend...

138
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:32,750
If only I would have
had more time!

139
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:36,666
[SHEN] Our similar gifts
eventually drove us apart.

140
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:40,291
I must admit, I was jealous
of his phenomenal strength.

141
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:42,416
It all came so easy to him.

142
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,750
Our relationship
became adversarial.

143
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:48,041
Even in the quiet times,
we were at odds.

144
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:51,041
The tension built so thick,
that one day all it took

145
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:55,458
was a bowl of spilled rice
to break our fragile alliance.

together was in anger.

Stop kicking!

164
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:35,666
Are you afraid of
getting your hands dirty?

165
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:40,125
[CHIAOTZU cackling]

166
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:41,458
[KRILLIN]
That's it!

167
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:44,208
He doesn't use his hands
to fight because he can't.

168
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:46,875
He needs them to
control his powers!

169
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:50,250
[KRILLIN]
You think you're clever, huh?

170
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:52,916
[CHIAOTZU]
Well, I'm no genius.

171
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,250
But I'm smart enough
to know you're stalling.

172
00:13:57,333 --> 00:13:58,625
[KRILLIN]
What's three plus four?

173
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:00,791
Huh?

174
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:02,333
Come on, that was an easy one!

175
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:04,833
You've gotta think
faster than that!

176
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:06,083
Let's see...

177
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:08,916
One, three. two--

178
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,833
Wrong, seven!

179
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:12,000
Huh?

180
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:15,666
Here's your other five!

181
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,791
[CHIAOTZU groans]

182

[CHIAOTZU groans]

184
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,500
Now's your chance, Krillin!

185
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:24,583
He's right.

186
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:26,458
[KRILLIN yells]

187
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:29,250

[CHIAOTZU cackles]

189
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:32,458
Nice work, Chiaotzu.

190
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:35,500
Seems that pest is a
glutton for punishment.

191
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:38,416
[CHIAOTZU cackles]

192
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:41,708
[KRILLIN groans]

193
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:44,875
I may have trouble counting,
but one thing's for sure...

194
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:47,208
My ten beats your five!

195
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:49,500
16 plus 27?

196
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:51,916
Huh? Uh?

197
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,375
Nine minus one?!

198
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:55,958
[CHIAOTZU whimpering]

[CHIAOTZU groans]

203
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:09,291
[SUPERVISOR] The winner
by a knock-out is Krillin!

204
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:13,583
[CROWD cheers]

205
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:16,125
The answer is eight!

206
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:22,666
[GOKU giggles]
Yay! Yeah!

207
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,791
Great job.

208
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:28,250
[KRILLIN laughs]

209
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:31,083
[ROSHI] I think Krillin enjoys
the crowds' adulation for him

210
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:33,916
more than the victory itself.

211
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,500
[CROWD cheering]

[TIEN growls]

213
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:46,416
Chiaotzu, how could you
disappoint me like that?

214
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,166
I was counting on you!

215
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:51,000
[GOKU, KRILLIN giggling]

216
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:54,708
Who would have ever guessed
a fighter needed mathematics!

217
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:14,416
That's wonderful news.
Congratulations. And thanks.

218
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:17,916
Sure. See, Chiaotzu is
what you'd call...

219
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,791
...slow. And I'm a genius!

220
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:27,541
132,000,000 plus 904,203,000?

221
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:30,208
Uh-- um...

222
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:38,958
Uh oh.

[BULMA]
1,036,203,000.

224
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,750
Maybe I'm not a genius,
but I still won.

[ALL laughing]

226
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:07,416
[SHEN]
Quickly, now. Two plus one?

227
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:12,833
Uh, uh, three! Three.

228
00:17:12,916 --> 00:17:14,416
Nine minus six?

229
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,250
Well, uh...

230
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:25,166
Three, yes? Three?

231
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:28,708
No fingers!

232
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:31,791
Count with your head,
not with your hands!

233

[KRILLIN grunts]

00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:29,666
Who's there?!

Hey, wait, you're--

00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:37,375
[GOKU]
Stop!

[KRILLIN] Goku!

244
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:44,375
Krillin, don't jump!

245
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:46,666
Has everyone forgotten
how to use a door!

Goku!

Which way did he go?
I think he was a ninja.

249
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:18,583
[KRILLIN groans]

250
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:20,333
He moves fast.

251
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:28,000
I know your scent.

252
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:30,833
I've smelled it
somewhere before.

[KRILLIN grunting]

254

Hey! You're the--

00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:43,208
[KRILLIN]
The Crane Hermit!

256
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:44,958
Why did you attack
me back there?!

257
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:47,208
[SHEN growls]
My motive is obvious!

258
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:49,041
You murdered my brother!

259
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:53,083
Not on purpose. He attacked.
I defended myself.

260
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:54,583
Tao is dead.

261
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:58,666
I don't care how it happened.
You're still going to pay!

262
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:07,083
[GOKU] Krillin, remember that
game Master Roshi taught us?

263
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:09,458
Right. You're it.

264
00:21:09,541 --> 00:21:11,791

[GOKU grunting]

268
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:28,916
[SHEN]
Tien Shinhan!

269
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:35,625
Tien? I don't remember
inviting you.

270
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:37,083
My apologies, Master.

271
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:39,833
But I didn't want
you to kill Goku.

272
00:21:39,916 --> 00:21:41,291
[SHEN]
Explain.

273
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:44,125
With all due respect, sir,
this shouldn't happen here.

274
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:50,583
No one wants vengeance
for this crime more than I.

275
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:54,416
But there is no satisfaction
in killing Goku here.

276
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,458
A quick death is
too good for him.

277
00:21:56,541 --> 00:21:59,958
He deserves to suffer
as we do now.

278
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:02,125
What did you have in mind?

279
00:22:02,208 --> 00:22:05,750
Tao was slain by Goku's hand,
but Master Roshi guided it.

280
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:08,500
He should watch his
pupil die in the ring.

281
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:13,166
broken and publicly humiliated.

282
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:15,541
Your heart is
cold and ruthless...

283
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:18,916
It warms my own. Proceed.

284
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:24,041
I am honored, Master.

285
00:22:24,125 --> 00:22:25,416
And you...

286
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:28,666
The next time we fight,
it will be for Tao's honor.

287
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:32,125
I'll fight. But it's not about
Tao. This one's for Yamcha!

288
00:22:32,208 --> 00:22:33,500
Whatever gets you there.

289
00:22:33,583 --> 00:22:36,541
Just don't lose any matches
between now and then.

290
00:22:36,625 --> 00:22:38,875
I'll do my best.

291
00:22:40,041 --> 00:22:41,583
[NARRATOR]
With their challenge set,

292
00:22:41,666 --> 00:22:44,166
the showdown between
Goku and Tien has raised

293
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:46,458
the tournament to
a whole new level.

294
00:22:46,541 --> 00:22:49,333
It's not just about
winning the title anymore.

295
00:22:49,416 --> 00:22:54,500
It's about survival.
Next time on Dragon Ball!
