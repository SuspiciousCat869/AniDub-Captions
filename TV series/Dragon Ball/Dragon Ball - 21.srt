00:02:13,583 --> 00:02:15,416
[NARRATOR] Previously
on Dragon Ball,

2
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,708
the World Martial Arts
Tournament began

3
00:02:17,791 --> 00:02:20,500
with its super intense
elimination round!

4
00:02:20,583 --> 00:02:23,500
Over one hundred fighters
entered the foot-flying fray,

5
00:02:23,583 --> 00:02:26,833
and Goku and Krillin plowed
through them one by one!

6
00:02:26,916 --> 00:02:28,416
But hold on!

7
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,583
Krillin and Goku aren't the only
ones advancing to the finals...!

8
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:34,000
Yamcha will be there too!

9
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:44,166
[GOKU chuckles]

10
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:48,708
[GOKU and KRILLIN chuckle]

11
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:05,625
[GOKU] Excuse us please!

12
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:07,375
[KRILLIN] Coming through!!

13
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:08,916
[GOKU] Sorry about that! Oops!

14
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,875
[KRILLIN] Oh! Watch your toes!

15
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:13,458
I don't think we'll find
Master Roshi any time soon

16
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:16,666
when all we can see
are people's pants legs!

17
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:17,666
[GOKU] Hello, sir!

18
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:20,708
Hm? Huh? Hmm...

19
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:21,833
Can you help?

20
00:03:21,916 --> 00:03:23,375
Eh?

21
00:03:25,583 --> 00:03:29,583
Uhh... Huh...

22
00:03:29,666 --> 00:03:32,125
Hey, I found 'em, Krillin!

23
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:33,625
[GOKU chuckles]

24
00:03:33,708 --> 00:03:37,166
Roshi! Where've you
been all this time?

25
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:40,250
Oh, uh, this place is
like a cattle herd...

26
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:41,833
I just went to the restroom

27
00:03:41,916 --> 00:03:44,333
and the toilet line
was a mile long.

28
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:46,875
Well, while you were out
on your bathroom adventures,

29
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:49,333
Krillin and Goku
really kicked tail!

30
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:52,166
Yeah and Yamcha made it too!

31
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:53,583
Yes, from what I heard

32
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:56,208
they just breezed
through their matches.

33
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:59,208
But I suspect the
finals will be different.

34
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:02,333
I got you something, Bulma.

35
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:05,250
Huh? Why?

36
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:07,125
[ROSHI] I saw this
shirt in the gift shop,

37
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:09,208
and it just screamed your name.

38
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:10,875
You... bought me that?

39
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:12,708
[ROSHI] It's a
token of friendship!

40
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:15,083
Wow! That's so sweet!

41
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:17,208
[BULMA and ROSHI chuckle]

42
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:21,208
And I got you this golden
souvenir key chain, too!

43
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:23,208
Oh, wow! Thank you...!

44
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:25,583
I didn't know you
could be so nice!

45
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:28,208
[ROSHI] Now could you
do a nice man a favor?

46
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:30,208
As a friend?

47
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:32,125
[BULMA groans]

48
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:33,250
[ROSHI] Could you squeeze into

49
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:34,541
that tight little
shirt I got you

50
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:37,708
and show off your
curves a bit more...?

51
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:39,250
You think?

52
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:41,625
Yeah...? Yeah?

53
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:44,750
[ROSHI giggles]

54
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:45,875
[BULMA] Pervert!!

55
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:47,416
[punch]

56
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:53,333
[ROSHI yells]

57
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:58,250
[ROSHI whimpers]

58
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:03,250
Maybe you should have entered
the tournament yourself, Bulma!

59
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:04,791
[GOKU] Oolong!

60
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:05,833
Huh?

61
00:05:05,916 --> 00:05:06,916
[GOKU and KRILLIN chuckle]

62
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,208
[OOLONG] Goku...! Wowzas!

63
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:11,000
You were incredible
in there! For real!

64
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:13,375
We were cheering
the entire time!

65
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:15,208
And I turned into a ladder!

66
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:16,750
[GOKU] That's great!

67
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:17,750
Huh?

68
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:20,375
Well done, boys. Well done.

69
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:21,708
Thank you!

70
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,291
It was just like a dream..

71
00:05:23,375 --> 00:05:26,333
But I knew we were going to
win the whole time, of course.

72
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:29,666
[BULLHORN GUY] The World Martial
Arts Tournament will soon begin!

73
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,791
If you're one of
the eight finalists,

74
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:34,875
please meet in the
main hall immediately...!

75
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:36,041
Thank you!

76
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:37,833
Well you boys had
better run along then.

77
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:39,916
[GOKU] Yeah! Guess so.

78
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:44,083
[GOKU] I'll look for
you in the audience!

79
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:47,916
[OOLONG] Do it
for the glory, kid!

80
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:51,375
Hmm. Now...

81
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,291
[BULMA] That boy never
ceases to amaze me...

82
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:57,208
[OOLONG] Huh?

83
00:05:57,291 --> 00:06:00,333
Hey... The old man...
went AWOL again!

84
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:03,000
I swear there's something
wrong with his head...

85
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:09,500
[crowd cheering]

86
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:11,291
[YAMCHA] So you saw
Bulma and Puar?

87
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:14,541
[GOKU] Yeah...
Oh, and Bulma said, "Hi."

88
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:16,083
Huh?

89
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:25,791
[JACKIE CHUN] Hmm. So you're
one of the fighters, huh?

90
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:30,333
Well, that means we have
something in common! Hehehe...

91
00:06:30,416 --> 00:06:31,541
[FIGHTER]
Hmph.

92
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:33,041
[JACKIE CHUN]
Hmmm...

93
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:35,875
[JACKIE CHUN chuckles]

94
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:37,166
Hm?

95
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:38,791
[GOKU sniffs]

96
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:07,333
[KRILLIN]
Who's the stink-bucket?

97
00:07:07,416 --> 00:07:09,083
[YAMCHA] That's Bacterian.

98
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:10,750
[YAMCHA] He's got
Herculean strength,

99
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:13,666
but that comes second
to his offensive odor!

100
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:17,125
They say he's never taken a
bath since the day he was born!

101
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:18,666
[YAMCHA] His opponents
can only fight

102
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:21,833
with one hand because the other
one has to hold their nose!

103
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:24,375
He takes advantage
of this to win!

104
00:07:24,458 --> 00:07:26,000
[KRILLIN]
That's a dirty trick.

105
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:28,291
[GOKU] I think
I'm gonna pass out!

106
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:33,916
Now can I have your
attention, please...?

107
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,250
I need you all
here at the front!

108
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:39,291
[GOKU and KRILLIN laugh]

109
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:43,166
[ANNOUNCER]
On second thought, mister,

110
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:45,541
why don't you stay in the back?

111
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:49,333
You'll be drawing lots to
determine your opponents

112
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:52,541
and the order of the fights,
so come up when you're called.

113
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:55,500
Let's keep this orderly
and civilized, people.

114
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:57,708
[JACKIE CHUN]
Ehh... Sonny?

115
00:07:57,791 --> 00:07:58,791
[ANNOUNCER] Yes?

116
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:00,208
--[RANFAN] Hey!
--Why don't you be a pal

117
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:02,333
and put me in the ring with her?

118
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:04,750
--[ANNOUNCER] Eh? Huh?
--[RANFAN] Oh...

119
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:06,750
I don't take requests!

120
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:10,083
[JACKIE CHUN thinking] Young
people are so unreasonable...

121
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:16,416
So, your name is... uh... Nem?

122
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,958
Nam.

123
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:25,833
A five.

124
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:27,916
[ANNOUNCER] Let's see...
I guess that puts you

125
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,583
in fight number three...

126
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:34,541
Now... Monster Beast Giran?

127
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:36,875
[GIRAN]
Ah.

128
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,208
[ANNOUNCER]
You drew number eight,

129
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:40,666
that means the fourth fight.

130
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,833
[ANNOUNCER] Bacterian?

131
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:46,041
[ANNOUNCER] Number one...

132
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:47,791
First fight.

133
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:48,791
[ANNOUNCER] Yamcha?

134
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:49,833
Yeah.

135
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:51,083
[ANNOUNCER] Number four...

136
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:52,958
That's fight two.

137
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:54,833
Where's Krillin?

138
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:56,541
Oh...! Here!

139
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:01,958
Can you reach it... sir?

140
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:08,041
I got one!

141
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:13,458
[groans and shudders]

142
00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:16,291
[KRILLIN] Hu... Huh?

143
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:17,541
[ANNOUNCER] Number two...

144
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:20,666
That puts you in fight
one against Bacterian!

145
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,875
Now... Gaw-what?

146
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:33,208
Gaw... Kay... Uh...?

147
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:35,916
[GOKU]
Uh... Uh...

148
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,500
Come on now...!
Gaw-kay-uh!

149
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:43,583
[GOKU]
Uh... Uh... Huh?

150
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,625
Hmm...

151
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:47,791
Six, seven, eight...

152
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:50,583
We're not missing anybody...

153
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:54,333
Uh... Sorry to butt in,
but that spells Goku.

154
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:56,125
Huh?!

155
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:59,041
Heh... Oh... yeah...

156
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:01,791
How silly of me...
All right, people...

157
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:04,458
Is there anyone in
the house named Goku?

158
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:06,708
Me!

159
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:09,083
[ANNOUNCER]
You've drawn number seven...

160
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:10,958
That's the final fight.

161
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:13,208
[ANNOUNCER] Ranfan?

162
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:14,208
Mhmmm?

163
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:15,541
[ANNOUNCER] Number six.

164
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:16,958
Jackie Chun?

165
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:19,333
Yo! Mm, mm...

166
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:21,041
[ANNOUNCER] Number three!

167
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:24,208
This will be
single elimination...

168
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:26,916
In a full,
regulation-sized arena...

169
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,333
You lose... if you fall
outside of the ring,

170
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:32,083
stay down for ten
counts, or give up...

171
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:33,750
But poking in the eyes

172
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:37,333
or hitting in the private
parts is not allowed!

173
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:39,041
What parts are private?

174
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:40,250
You know what I mean...

175
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:43,458
It's the... things
that make us boys!

176
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:47,583
But what... aaaabout my parts?

177
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:49,125
Gaaah!

178
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:52,958
Okay everyone, I think that's
enough questions for now!

179
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:56,125
So just stay here and I'll
come back when it's time.

180
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,500
[GOKU] One more thing!

181
00:10:59,583 --> 00:11:00,625
Where's our lunch?

182
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:01,833
[ANNOUNCER] Huh?

183
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:03,208
Don't you think it's a bad idea

184
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:05,875
to eat a meal right
before your fight?

185
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:08,625
You might get cramps that way!

186
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:10,875
I will eat!

187
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:12,416
Uhhh...

188
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:16,791
Well, I'm sure we can round
up something, don'tcha think?

189
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:19,333
But of course...
Come with me.

190
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:21,416
Are you coming too?

191
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,875
Uh... I think I'll pass...

192
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:25,416
I'm too nervous to swallow.

193
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,916
I finished it. Is there more?

194
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:46,291
Now, ladies and gentlemen!
Are you ready?

195
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:47,666
That's right, people!

196
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:53,708
It's time for the 21st World
Martial Arts Tournament!

197
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:56,083
Okay, and here are
the big match-ups

198
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:58,333
for the tournament's
first round.

199
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:03,125
First match:
Bacterian versus Krillin!

200
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:11,333
Second match:
Jackie Chun versus Yamcha!

201
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:18,958
Fight three:
Ranfan versus Nam!

202
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:23,875
And match four:

203
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:28,125
Gaw-ku--no, uh--
Goku versus Giren!!

204
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:46,416
The first match between
Bacterian and Krillin

205
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:50,916
will begin momentarily, so
don't go to the lemonade stand!

206
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,583
Before we get things fired up,

207
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:54,500
let me remind you
that this year's winner

208
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:58,125
will receive a prize of
five hundred thousand zeni!

209
00:12:58,208 --> 00:12:59,458
With that said, let's welcome

210
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:01,333
the esteemed director
of the Tournament,

211
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:05,208
who has a few words of
wisdom to start this baby off!

212
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:07,458
Please go ahead, sir.

213
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:21,583
[silence]

214
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:26,708
[silence]

215
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:29,791
[clears throat]
Ruff!

216
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:32,291
[ANNOUNCER]
Isn't that profound?!

217
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:37,583
And now, the first
match of the tournament!

218
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,708
Would the contestants
please come down?!

219
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:45,708
[crowd cheers]

220
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:47,958
Just keep punching, Krillin.

221
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:50,125
I'm positive you'll win!

222
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:10,541
[ANNOUNCER] Fighting in the
bright red uniform is Krillin!

223
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:13,625
He's one of the youngest
competitors we have this year!

224
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:17,083
And fighting in the soiled
brown briefs is Bacterian,

225
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:18,541
who as you probably noticed,

226
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:21,416
has a very distinctive
odor about him!

227
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,958
Smells like we got
here just in time!

228
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:25,916
It smells like we
should have been late!

229
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,500
Hope that boy beats
Bacterian quick

230
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:30,291
so we can get him off the stage!

231
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:32,333
--[GOKU] Psst! Hey!
--[KRILLIN] Hmm?

232
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:33,541
[KRILLIN laughs]

233
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:35,708
I'll be cheering
for you from up here!

234
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:38,500
[GOKU laughs]

235
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:40,500
Okay, guys!

236
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:43,416
Let's try to keep
this nice and clean...

237
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:45,583
[ANNOUNCER]
All right, scratch that.

238
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:48,083
It's clearly not possible.

239
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:51,958
So, uh, just try not to get
anything on the audience, okay?

240
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:08,958
Let's get those
punches... flying!

241
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:25,000
[BACTERIAN] Hello, boy!
You come closer! Yes?

242
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:35,916
[BACTERIAN]
Huh...?

243
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:41,541
I miss you... Tricky!

244
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:47,833
[BACTERIAN] Now...
I've got some trickies too!

245
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:03,000
[BACTERIAN]
And here... Try this!

246
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,333
[BULMA] Oh... Vomit!

247
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:16,416
[BACTERIAN] Smelly finger!!!

248
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:37,833
[ANNOUNCER]
And Krillin goes down

249
00:16:37,916 --> 00:16:40,583
after he's hit by
the smelly finger attack!

250
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,833
[MONK] One...! Two...! Three...!

251
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:45,625
[ANNOUNCER]
It seems the horrid smell

252
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:48,333
is too much for
the little warrior!

253
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:50,458
[ANNOUNCER] It's an
assault on his senses!

254
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:52,291
[BULMA] I think
I've been traumatized...

255
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:54,250
[OOLONG] Get up Krillin!

256
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:58,666
[various cheers for KRILLIN]

257
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,250
[BACTERIAN]
You say good-bye!

258
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:17,875
[ANNOUNCER] Bacterian
has caught his opponent

259
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:19,625
in a terrible choke-hold!

260
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:22,541
Krillin's smoothly-shaved
head is looking like a cherry!

261
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,500
[KRILLIN groans]

262
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:27,000
[ANNOUNCER]
No, wait! A blueberry!

263
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:30,166
Quick, Krillin...!
Hit his arms away from you!

264
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:35,458
[KRILLIN struggles]

265
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:45,583
[MONK] One...! Two...!

266
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:48,041
[BACTERIAN]
You made... me hurt!

267
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,250
[ANNOUNCER] Krillin made
a strong counter assault!

268
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:03,583
But now he's dangerously
close to a ring-out!

269
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:23,125
[BACTERIAN] Up and down!
And up and down!

270
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:30,833
Up and down! Up and down!
Up and down!...

271
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:32,208
[ANNOUNCER]
What's this?!

272
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:35,416
Krillin seems to have
Bacterian by the pant-seat!

273
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:41,500
[BACTERIAN]
Here's a surprise!

274
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:47,750
[BACTERIAN grunts]

275
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:50,291
[ANNOUNCER]
Oh! What cruelty...!

276
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:53,708
Bacterian has resorted
to chemical warfare...!

277
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:56,458
This could be the end!

278
00:18:56,541 --> 00:18:58,208
Oh, my goodness!

279
00:18:58,291 --> 00:19:02,750
How can one person do
so many disgusting things?

280
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:24,208
[ANNOUNCER] Bacterian
just keeps on stomping!

281
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:29,083
[ANNOUNCER]
Wow, folks...!

282
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:31,500
I've never seen a
beating so ruthless!

283
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:35,583
And Krillin is too stunned from
the body odor to defend himself!

284
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:38,916
[BULMA]
It's so awful!

285
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,750
[BACTERIAN]
I am tricky!!

286
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:58,125
[BACTERIAN guffaws]

287
00:19:58,208 --> 00:20:00,833
[MONK] One...! Two...!

288
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:03,458
[BULMA] Go...! Go...!

289
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:05,000
[PUAR] Please!

290
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:08,625
[ALL THREE] Krillin!
Krillin! Krillin! Krillin...!

291
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:13,750
[CROWD] Krillin!
Krillin! Krillin! Krillin!...

292
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:17,208
[MONK] Five...! Six...!

293
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:21,333
Come on...!
It's not over yet!

294
00:20:21,416 --> 00:20:23,583
Uh... Uh...!

295
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:25,041
Krillin! Hey!

296
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:27,708
Focus your mind and
you won't smell him...!

297
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:29,541
Just think about it!

298
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:32,041
You don't have
a nose, remember?!

299
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:35,125
[KRILLIN shudders]

300
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:38,000
Hey...! He's right!

301
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:40,958
[MONK] Nine...!

302
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:44,083
[ANNOUNCER]
Hold on, folks!

303
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:46,333
Krillin has stood up!

304
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:48,166
It seems he's
caught his second wind

305
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,666
after Bacterian's breaking wind!

306
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,333
How does this boy do it?

307
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:54,458
Thanks for the tip, Goku!

308
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,583
Now... My turn!

309
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:04,708
Okay, stinky not
enough for you?

310
00:21:06,291 --> 00:21:09,416
Then here's
super-special tricky!

311
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:14,166
[ANNOUNCER] Oh, my...!
Could it be...?

312
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:15,791
Bacterian is now preparing

313
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:18,708
for his most notorious
attack move...!

314
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:19,833
It's the deep-throated,

315
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:22,041
mucous-filled
loogie of death...!

316
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:24,541
No opponent has
ever withstood it!

317
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,458
[BACTERIAN]
I'm done... for!

318
00:22:01,666 --> 00:22:04,416
[ANNOUNCER] What a
roller coaster, folks!

319
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:08,333
Krillin has won the round with
a come-from-behind knockout!

320
00:22:08,416 --> 00:22:10,666
Yeah!!

321
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:13,875
[crowd cheers]

322
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:16,875
[GOKU &amp; KRILLIN] We made it!
We made it! We made it!

323
00:22:16,958 --> 00:22:18,541
Awesome job, Krillin!

324
00:22:18,625 --> 00:22:20,041
Thank you, Goku!

325
00:22:20,125 --> 00:22:26,208
[GOKU &amp; KRILLIN
laugh and cheer]

326
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:28,833
[ANNOUNCER] Well! If we learned
anything from this match,

327
00:22:28,916 --> 00:22:31,750
it's that no matter how used
you are to your own stench,

328
00:22:31,833 --> 00:22:34,875
you'll always be stunned
by someone else's!

329
00:22:34,958 --> 00:22:38,208
Now, I just hope they
can clean up the arena!

330
00:22:38,291 --> 00:22:39,458
[cheering continues]

331
00:22:39,541 --> 00:22:42,458
[NARRATOR] So, after an
exciting--and unusual--

332
00:22:42,541 --> 00:22:44,666
round of fighting,
Krillin has advanced

333
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:47,333
from the first round
of Tournament play!

334
00:22:47,416 --> 00:22:49,291
But with the
strangeness of this match,

335
00:22:49,375 --> 00:22:52,791
one can only wonder what the
next fights will have in store!

336
00:22:52,875 --> 00:22:55,750
Don't miss the next Dragon Ball!
