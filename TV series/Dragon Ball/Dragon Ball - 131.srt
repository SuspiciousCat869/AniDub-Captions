[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball.

2
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:16,583
Goku was eager
to begin training for

3
00:02:16,666 --> 00:02:18,416
the World Martial
Arts Tournament

4
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:22,333
and Mr. Popo was there to see
that he stuck to his program.

5
00:02:22,416 --> 00:02:24,958
Even though the tournament
was three years away,

6
00:02:25,041 --> 00:02:28,208
Goku was put through the paces
by a very special doll

7
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:30,583
that Mr. Popo
had designed himself.

8
00:02:30,666 --> 00:02:34,333
And it was clear that Goku
had a lot of work to do.

9
00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:36,666
[POPO] It's as I've
told you before, dear boy.

10
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,833
Your speed and skill are
matched evenly with the doll,

11
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:41,208
only you haven't finished
your mind training.

12
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:43,375
[NARRATOR] Taking Mr.
Popo's advice to heart,

13
00:02:43,458 --> 00:02:46,708
Goku came out swinging,
but he still had a tough time

14
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:49,708
toppling his overly
animated opponent.

15
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:53,375
[NARRATOR] Luckily time
was still on their side,

16
00:02:53,458 --> 00:02:55,958
and Goku could rest up
before he began his next

17
00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:58,291

[GOKU snoring]

19
00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:03,541
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile, Yamcha,
Tien, Chiaotzu, and Krillin

20
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:05,291
were on their way
to Korin's Tower

21
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:06,583
in the hope that
they could improve

22
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:08,333
their own fighting skills.

23
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:10,458
Does this mean
that Goku's friends will become

24
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:12,500
his most fearsome competition?

25
00:03:20,916 --> 00:03:30,916
[tribal music playing]

26
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:05,791
So this Korin tower,
does it really exist?

27
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:09,666
It has to exist. That's where
Goku's training right now.

28
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,000
And I guarantee
he's gotten a lot stronger

29
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:14,625
since undertaking this burden.

30
00:04:14,708 --> 00:04:17,666
Goku's even stronger? Really?

31
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:20,458
Be patient. You'll see, Krillin.

32
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:22,666
We'll have a better idea
of where the tower is

33
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,416
once we get over this mountain.

34
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,291
Perhaps the people in the
area can show us the way.

my little friend.

166
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:55,166
But how did you know
what moves I was gonna make?

167
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,166
Oh, it was really
quite simple.

168
00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:00,125
I could feel your spiritual
energy all around me.

169
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:02,375
Awww...

170
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:05,375
Now this time
try and find me.

171
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:10,583
[GOKU] I can't see
a thing with this on.

172
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:13,708
How am I ever going to find him?

173
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:16,541
Well Goku,
what are you waiting for?

174
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:18,000
Okay.

175
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:22,791
[POPO]
Yoohoo. I'm over here.

176
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:25,833
I'm right here.

177
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:30,500
[POPO] Stop guessing.
You must focus on my energy.

178
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:31,916
I can't see a thing.

179
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,250
How am I supposed to catch you?

180
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:39,708
You see. I can control
my spiritual energy.

181
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:41,250
But you cannot.

182
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:42,500
[GOKU]
Mm?

183
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:44,958
Most everyone generates
an aura when they move.

184
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:47,375
You should be able to
see it if you concentrate.

185
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:49,125
Concentrate?

186
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:52,250
Use your mind and try to focus.

187
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:54,083
My mind?

188
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:02,083
Ah!

[laughing]

190
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:29,333
Pardon my asking, but we're
looking for Korin Tower.

191
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:31,250
I don't suppose if you'd
know if it is um,

192
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:32,750
anywhere near here?

193
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:36,041
Korin Tower? No, I haven't
heard of that place.

194
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:37,583
Too bad.

195
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:40,750
I bet if you ask the village
elder he might know where it is.

196
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:42,208

Mm!

198
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:50,000
What's wrong, Chiaotzu?
You look worried.

199
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:52,416
[CHIAOTZU]
Something is very wrong here.

200
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,083
[TIEN]
What is it?

201
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:57,125
Hey pal.
Don't just stand there,

202
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:59,583
come over here and have a drink.

Yes, you're a true champion.
You're the best. Well done.

Thank you, sir.

Excuse me, Elder?

Yes, what is it Mint?

213
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:31,708
I'm sorry to disturb you, sir,

214
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:34,125
but these boys would
like to ask you something.

215
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:35,500
Yeah, sir.

216
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:37,541
Wait, the first rule
of festival day

217
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:39,500
is for everyone
to have a good time.

218
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:42,666
I insist that you sit
and enjoy yourselves.

219
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,291
Sounds good.

220
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:45,500
Thank you.

221
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:47,541
Hmmm...

222
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:53,583
Here. Drink up.

223
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:55,750
[KRILLIN] I'm still
a little young to drink.

224
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:57,166
It's home made rootbeer.

225
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:00,125
I made it with
my own special recipe.

226
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:02,958
Well okay. If it's rootbeer.

227
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:10,083
Ooh. Mm.

228
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:12,083
Where ya from, stranger?

229
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:14,000
I'm from somewhere back east.

Hey, that's where I'm from!
[laughing]

231

Are you a warrior too?

[laughs]

233
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:22,833
I train everyday and I'm one of

234
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:25,500
the most bestest
fighters in the world.

235

[MAN]
Enjoy the festival.

236
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:36,541
[PAOL] Judging from his eyes
I can tell this guy

237
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:38,791
is no ordinary man.

238
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:41,375
[TIEN grunts]

239
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:44,958
It seems to me that you've been
in a fight or two in your time.

240
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:47,625
Care to accept
my challenge for a match?

241
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:49,416
Yeah. Great.

242
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,875
This could be interesting.
Why don't you accept.

243
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:54,875
If you win, we'll grant you
anything you want

244

in the whole village.

245
00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:59,333
But good luck.
I doubt that you'll win.

Sure. You're on.

Hold it. Me first.

Let me have a chance
to fight the big guy.

You know I can take him.

252
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:14,833
It's what I've been
training for.

[chuckles] Little man, you're
in no condition to fight me.

256

drank a lot of rootbeer.

even have his guard up.

The mountain spirit has
always protected our village.

It would never blow up on us.

No Krillin!

329
00:22:23,416 --> 00:22:25,208
[chuckles]

330
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:27,583
Be careful!

331
00:22:27,666 --> 00:22:29,625
They must be crazy.

332
00:22:31,125 --> 00:22:32,083
[TIEN] I know it's risky,

333
00:22:32,166 --> 00:22:34,666
but I've got to
stop that lava.

334
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:36,333
[NARRATOR]
Is Tien overestimating

335
00:22:36,416 --> 00:22:38,208
his own strength once again?

336
00:22:38,291 --> 00:22:41,000
And what about Yamcha,
Chiaotzu, and Krillin?

337
00:22:41,083 --> 00:22:43,000
They should know that
running straight into

338
00:22:43,083 --> 00:22:46,000
an active volcano
will be no picnic.

339
00:22:46,083 --> 00:22:48,166
They're all heading
into red hot trouble

340
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:50,583
that they might not
come out of alive.

341
00:22:50,666 --> 00:22:53,541
Don't miss the next Dragon Ball.
