00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:12,833
How did it go?

172
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:14,666
Did you take care of
the boy nuisance?

173
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,708
[TAO] Of course.
Everything you asked.

174
00:11:16,791 --> 00:11:18,333
I've had to stop
on a bit of an errand,

175
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:21,333
but I'll be there in a
few days to deliver your prize

176
00:11:21,416 --> 00:11:22,750
and collect my fee.

177
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:24,541
[RED] The brat's
really gone, huh?

178
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:27,708
That's right.
And I accept cash only.

179
00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:29,083
Yeah, I got it!

180
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:31,000
Now are you absolutely sure

181
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:34,541
you've collected all
four of the Dragon Balls?

182
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:35,458
[TAO] What?!

183
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:37,666
There are only three!

184
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:40,166
One short! Check the boy's body.

185
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:43,708
He probably had one of the
Dragon Balls in his clothing.

186
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:46,625
Right. Well, we can
take it from here...

187
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:48,291
He's no longer a threat,

188
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:51,083
so I'll just send a man
to retrieve the ball.

189
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:54,458
I mean, how difficult could
that possibly be now?

190
00:11:54,541 --> 00:11:56,625
[TAO] Great.
See you in a few days.

191
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:58,708
We'll see you then, Tao.

192
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:03,916
That's a relief.
Everything's in place.

193
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,750
That man is certainly
worth the fee.

194
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:30,250
Oh, Daddy...

195
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:34,541
I wish I had been
strong enough to help...

saved Goku, too...

such enormous problems.
