[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball:

2
00:02:14,166 --> 00:02:17,541
Sergeant Major Murasaki
charged into action!

3
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:19,625
This tricky ninja
will stop at nothing

4
00:02:19,708 --> 00:02:22,500
to prevent Goku from
rescuing the Village Chief.

5
00:02:22,583 --> 00:02:26,250
The battle was fierce, but our
hero was up to the challenge.

6
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:28,333
He proved that you
should never underestimate

7
00:02:28,416 --> 00:02:31,000
a boy and his pole,
especially when that boy

8
00:02:31,083 --> 00:02:32,458
is Goku!

9
00:02:37,583 --> 00:02:39,291
[NARRATOR]
Murasaki attacked using all

10
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:41,083
of the techniques
at his disposal,

11
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:43,500
but Goku was able
to handle every surprise

12
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:45,375
the ninja threw his way.

13
00:02:48,583 --> 00:02:50,041
That wasn't fair!

14
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:53,000
You said you
didn't have a weapon!

15
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:56,041
[NARRATOR] Every surprise--
that is, except one.

Wahahahahaha!

[MURASAKI]
Now you know why they call me...

21
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:20,666
...the messenger of Death.

22
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:24,458
[laughing]

23
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:01,750
Yes...
That's what I call results.

[incoherent babbling]

No more dirty tricks!
Now it's my turn!

33
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:39,291
Impossible...

34
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:41,291
No one could survive that
kind of blow to the head.

35
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:42,541
No one!

36
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:44,083
What are you trying to do to me?

37
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:46,708
Get back down on the ground
where you belong!

You better not be hiding again!

Haha! Hoho! Ha!

44
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:40,208
Go ahead.
Take your best shot if you can.

45
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:42,166
Hey-ya!

Whoa!

[MURASAKI laughing]

00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:50,625
I call that the
overturned mat trick!

49
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:51,916
Catch this one!

50
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:55,625
Hi-ya!

51
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,583
Wow...

[MURASAKI laughing]

Out of stars?

00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:07,250
Nope.

55
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:09,666
[MURASAKI]
No mat!

00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,416
Oh! Ho!

57
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,041
Look at me! I'm deformed!

58
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:20,333
Oh, I knew I should have
shelled out the extra 25 Zenni

59
00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:22,291
for the complete set, but no!

00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:24,541
"When am I ever gonna
need six mats?" I said.

61
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:26,958
[MURASAKI] Well that's
the last time I buy...

[growling]

63
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:03,291
How will my village survive
without my guidance?

64
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:05,833
I must find a way
to return to them.

65
00:07:05,916 --> 00:07:07,500
They need my help.

66
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:15,000
All right,
old timer, food's here.

67
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:17,791
Hey! Old man, are you deaf?

68
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:20,500
[VILLAGE CHIEF] I will not
eat while I am your prisoner.

69
00:07:20,583 --> 00:07:23,375
Send the food to my people.

70
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:26,250
Fine. Let the rats have it.

71
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:28,708
What's with all the
noise I hear downstairs?

72
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:30,083
It's nothing.

73
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:32,125
There's some
little boy running around.

74
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:33,583
A little boy?

75
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,500
He sneaked in,
I guess to rescue you.

76
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:38,583
Don't worry.

77
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,750
He's probably in
a million pieces by now.

78
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:41,791
What?!

00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:44,375
Why you--

80
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:46,875
Picking on an old man is
one thing, but a little child!

81
00:07:46,958 --> 00:07:48,208
You are barbaric!

82
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:49,666
What if that were your own son?

83
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,416
What kind of an
army fights children?!

Let go of me, you old fool!

00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:55,375
If he were my kid,

I wouldn't send him here
in the first place!

any men in your village?

[SOLDIER A]
Pathetic.

I've got to do something,
and quickly!

Stop, will ya?

Neat shoes,
but what's the big deal?

100
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,291
I can just swim across.

Sure. That's a great idea, kid.

102

See, this is a special pond,
full of piranhas!

106

Full of pajamas?

Are you deaf?
I said Piranha!

of the genus Serrasalmus.

In other words, it's a little
fish with a big, big bite!

What's that? I can't hear what
you're saying. Speak up!

Why don't you try it?

are ready to give up now?

last straw, little boy!

which one to fight.

that it's really you,

I won't fall for
that trick again!

00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:43,750
Suno...

167
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,041
I'm worried.

168
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:48,208
It's natural to be scared, dear,

169
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:50,625
but everything's
going to be all right.

170
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,708
[rustling]

171
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:55,833
[gasp]

172
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:07,458
Father!

173
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:09,250
Hello, dear.

174
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:11,375
What's wrong, Suno?

175
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:13,250
[MOTHER] It's nothing. She's
just frightened by everything

176
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:16,541
that's been going on lately.
We all are.

177
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:18,625
Did you find
the Dragon Ball today?

178
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:20,208
No, not yet.

179
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:22,708
I'm worried about that
awful Muscle Tower, Father.

180
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:24,250
Have you heard
any news about it?

181
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:27,708
Has anyone been caught
inside or maybe escaped?

182
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:31,000
I've never mentioned that place.
Why would you ask about it?

183
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:41,208
A child?! By himself?!

184
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:43,083
Yes, Father,
but he's very strong!

185
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:44,375
In fact, he beat up two of those

186
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:46,625
Red Ribbon Army
soldiers right here!

187
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:49,666
We saw him do it!
Didn't we, mother?

188
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,250
Yes.

189
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:53,166
He's brave, too!
As soon as he heard,

190
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:56,208
he ran straight to Muscle Tower
to free the Village Chief!

191
00:15:56,291 --> 00:15:58,875
But the danger is
too great to go alone!

192
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:04,291
There's some thing inside
the tower that isn't human!

193
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:18,666
[distant fighting]

194
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,750
[GOKU]
Whoa!

195
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:20,541
All right. I'd better
hide here for a while

196
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:23,500
until I can figure out
exactly what's going on.

197
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:30,583
Boy, he's really good.

198
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:34,458
He can make all of his other
hims do different things.

199
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:35,875
[MURASAKI D] Where did he go?!

200
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:37,583
[MURASAKI E]
He couldn't have gone far.

201
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:40,041
[MURASAKI D] Yes. He's got
to be around here somewhere.

202
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:41,916
[MURASAKI E] Let's split up
so we can cover more ground.

203
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,500
They're talking to each other!

204
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:47,416
But how is that possible?!

205
00:17:49,916 --> 00:17:51,250
[MURASAKI] There he is!

206
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:53,041
[laughing tauntingly]

207
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:54,083
Don't leave.

208
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:56,583
Why, we're just getting started!

209
00:17:56,666 --> 00:17:59,458
How can you make the fake
yous do all this stuff?

210
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:01,041
That's for me to know...

211
00:18:01,125 --> 00:18:04,125
...and you to deal with,
if you live long enough.

212
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:05,750
[yelling]

213
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:11,291
[laughing menacingly]

214
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:13,833
Isn't it obvious? I'm the
one you've been fighting.

215
00:18:13,916 --> 00:18:14,958
The eldest.

216
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:16,666
I am number two.

217
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,000
Three, that's me.

218
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:19,916
That makes me four.

219
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,916
Five! Five!

220
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,875
Formation! Haha!

221
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:30,666
We are the five
Murasaki brothers!

222
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:40,166
Oh boy!

223
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:43,541
And as you have seen,
all of us are very much real!

224
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:44,916
[gulp]

225
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,500
Yes. Now that
you know our secret,

226
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:50,250
prepare to meet your
demise at the hands of the

227
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:52,958
mighty Murasaki Ninjas!

228
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:56,708
Five against one doesn't
seem like a fair fight,

229
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:58,000
but I'm ready.

230
00:18:58,083 --> 00:19:00,000
Two can play at this game.

231
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:05,333
Okay, which one of you
guys wants to go first?

232
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:07,291
You insolent child!

233
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:09,833
We will strike you down
together, as one!

234
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:15,458
[yelling]

235
00:19:15,541 --> 00:19:17,666
Okay!

236
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:26,125
Here I am!

237
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:33,958
Look out behind you!

238
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:42,416
Stop hiding! Stop!

239
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,458
Hey!

240
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:51,875
[GOKU] Well that's
three down, two to go.

241
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:53,208
I don't believe it!

242
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:56,500
He knows how to do the
Afterimage trick for real!

243
00:19:56,583 --> 00:20:00,833
Be quiet! Stop your whining
and concentrate on the battle!

244
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:09,291
Hurts... really hurts...

245
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,625
Now wait a minute!
Let's talk about this, okay?!

246
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:20,875
Next up, number one.

247
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:25,333
Monster?!

248
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:29,916
I've never actually seen it,

249
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,500
but I've heard the stories
of a living nightmare

250
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:35,708
that lurks somewhere
deep within Muscle Tower.

251
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:39,541
[FATHER] They say
sometimes, late at night,

252
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:41,500
you can hear
the creature moaning

253
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:44,041
as it searches
for its next victim.

254
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:53,750
[faint growling]

255
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:57,708
[FATHER] I'm afraid if a child
were trapped in that place,

256
00:20:57,791 --> 00:21:00,625
it could not survive
such an abomination.

257
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:15,375
Let's pray that the boy
somehow finds his way out.

258
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:18,541
That's all we can
do for him right now.

259
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:21,333
Goku... he's lost!

260
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:25,500
Our thoughts go out
to this brave boy

261
00:21:25,583 --> 00:21:26,958
and we hope he finds freedom

262
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:29,041
from the evil
that threatens him.

263
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:39,791
Boy, you sure like to run
a lot, don't you, number one?

264
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:46,875
I definitely need a raise!

265
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:53,583
Hey! Yoo-hoo!

266
00:21:53,666 --> 00:21:56,333
Earth to Android Eight!
Wake up! It's your turn!

267
00:21:56,416 --> 00:21:57,875
Destroy the boy!

268
00:22:01,666 --> 00:22:02,916
Caught you!

269
00:22:09,958 --> 00:22:12,666
[MURASAKI] Go and fight,
number eight! Annihilate!

270
00:22:29,541 --> 00:22:31,416
[NARRATOR] It appears
the mysterious monster

271
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,875
of Muscle Tower
is actually an android!

272
00:22:33,958 --> 00:22:36,333
But that doesn't
make it any less dangerous.

273
00:22:36,416 --> 00:22:39,125
Whatever Android #8
has in store for our hero,

274
00:22:39,208 --> 00:22:40,166
One thing is certain:

275
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:42,250
It doesn't look
happy to see him!

276
00:22:42,333 --> 00:22:44,708
Can Goku overcome
his newest opponent?

277
00:22:44,791 --> 00:22:47,291
Or will Murasaki
have the last laugh?

278
00:22:47,375 --> 00:22:49,208
There's only
one way to find out...

279
00:22:49,291 --> 00:22:51,750
Tune in next time for
another thrilling episode

280
00:22:51,833 --> 00:22:53,625
of Dragon Ball!
