00:02:13,291 --> 00:02:15,666
[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball...

2
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,000
Goku paid a visit

3
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:19,041
to the Red Ribbon
Army Headquarters,

4
00:02:19,125 --> 00:02:22,291
in hope of acquiring
two Dragon Balls.

5
00:02:25,583 --> 00:02:27,708
[NARRATOR]
One after another, soldiers fell

6
00:02:27,791 --> 00:02:30,541
like dominos as our hero
fought his way through

7
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:32,250
the evil stronghold.

8
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:34,500
The firepower of the
enemy was intense,

9
00:02:34,583 --> 00:02:37,166
but Goku was
determined to succeed.

10
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:40,083
He knew the only way to fulfill
his promise of reviving

11
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:43,916
Upa's slain father, was to
claim all Seven Dragon Balls

12
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,208
and summon the power
of the Eternal Dragon.

13
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:50,083
A noble task, but one filled
with peril as he headed

14
00:02:50,166 --> 00:02:52,875
for a showdown
against Commander Red.

15
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:59,291
Fool! He doesn't even know
how to work an elevator!

16
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:02,166
Somebody explain to me how
the world's strongest army

17
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:04,750
could lose to this imbecile

18
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,291
[SOLDIER A]
You punk!

19
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:25,916
You're goin' down!

20
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:28,791
[GOKU]
Hm?

21
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:43,041
[SOLDIERS groaning]

22
00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:51,250
We did it!

23
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:52,750
He's toast.

24
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:56,416
That wasn't very nice.

25
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,416
[SOLDIER D screams]

26
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,208
[GOKU yells]

27
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:02,750
[SOLDIERS groan]

28
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:04,208
[GOKU grumbles]

29
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:06,458
[SOLDIER F, SOLDIER G whimper]

30
00:04:06,541 --> 00:04:10,083
Forget the hazard pay!
I'm outta here!

31
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:11,500
[GOKU]
Hm?

32
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:14,208
[RED] Idiots! Hundreds of
trained professionals

33
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:16,791
and they can't even
handle one child!

34
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:18,458
[STAFF OFFICER]
But sir, the kid does display

35
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:19,958
extraordinary powers.

36
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:23,583
[RED] I can see that.
I'm only missing one eye.

37
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:26,750
I don't need you to point out
the obvious, you imbecile!

38
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:27,833
[STAFF OFFICER]
Uh, yes, sir.

39
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:29,250
If you had trained
those men properly

40
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:31,666
in the first place, we wouldn't
be having this problem.

41
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:34,375
Honestly, I should have
never listened to your sister!

42
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:35,833
[STAFF OFFICER]
My apologies, sir.

43
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,125
[GOKU]
Hm.

44
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:41,166
They're right above me.

45
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:47,541
[GOKU groans]

46
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:49,375
Maybe I should get a helmet.

47
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:52,375
[RED cackling]
You may be strong as an ox,

48
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:53,916
but you're dumb as one too!

49
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,208
The ceiling is reinforced
with a special alloy.

50
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:58,833
No one can break
through it, not even you!

51
00:04:58,916 --> 00:05:00,458
Just look at that brat.

52
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:02,500
Now is the perfect time
to wipe him out!

53
00:05:02,583 --> 00:05:04,833
Isn't there one soldier
in this entire Army

54
00:05:04,916 --> 00:05:07,000
that can rid me of this menace?!

55
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:13,625
[RED] Colonel Violet! I knew
you wouldn't let me down.

56
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:16,625
She is a perfect example
of the caliber of soldier

57
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:20,375
we need in this army!
Proactive, dependable and loyal.

58
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:26,291
[SOLDIERS screaming]

59
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:28,083
[SOLDIER H screams]

60
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:34,833
[VIOLET] Hm. Looks like the
Ribbon has finally been cut.

61
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:42,250
Huh? Hello, Colonel Violet,
what are you doing?

62
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:45,166
The kid's not in that room,
he's further down!

63
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:51,000
[alarm sounds]

64
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:53,583
Sir, she's headed for the safe!

65
00:06:01,125 --> 00:06:03,041
Why that double-crossing
two-timer!

66
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:05,708
She's proactive all right,
at giving herself a raise.

67
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:07,125
[RED growls]

68
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:08,500
[STAFF OFFICER] Commander,
wait! Where are you going?

69
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:10,833
I can't let you leave
this room. It's not secure.

70
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:12,833
The contents of
that safe represent

71
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:15,041
years of hard work
and it belongs to me!

72
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:16,750
[STAFF OFFICER] Sir, our most
valuable possessions

73
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:21,041
are still secure: the
Dragon Balls. Forget the safe.

74
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:25,458
[RED] No, no, no, no, no!
Don't you lecture me!

75
00:06:25,541 --> 00:06:28,333
I'm the leader
around here, got it?!

76
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:13,958
[VIOLET] It's a shame everything
in life can't be this easy.

77
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:17,708
[VIOLET cackles]

78
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:22,166
[VIOLET] Consider this
my severance package.

79
00:07:25,416 --> 00:07:29,958
[RED growls]
You won't get away with this!

80
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:46,541
[RED] You little jackal!
If that's the way

81
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:49,708
you want it, fine. But you can
forget me as a reference!

82
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:51,083
[STAFF OFFICER]
Commander, it looks as though

83
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:53,500
the rest of the soldiers
are evacuating as well.

84
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:54,583
What?!

85
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:04,041
This isn't a democracy!
Get them back here!

86
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:05,583
Attention all personnel.

87
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:08,375
No evacuation orders
have been given.

88
00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:10,541
[STAFF OFFICER]
Return to your posts at once.

89
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:15,291
Failure to comply will be
met with terminal force.

90
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:20,416
[SOLDIER C whimpers, screams]

91
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:28,416
Traitors! Every last
one of them, worthless.

92
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,458
[STAFF OFFICER] Commander,
it is my duty to appraise you

93
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:32,916
of our situation.
And right now we are outmatched.

94
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
The boy is too powerful.

95
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:37,208
[RED growling]

96
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:40,125
Please sir, we should get out of
here while there's still time.

97
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:41,666
Retreat from a child?!

98
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:42,916
[STAFF OFFICER gasps]

99
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,583
[RED] Never...
You overestimate his chances.

100
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:49,083
[STAFF OFFICER] You mean
you're going to fight him?

101
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:52,500
[RED]
No, of course not... You are.

102
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:53,833
[STAFF OFFICER gasps]

103
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:58,291
I will ready our next plan...

104
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:00,583
You will remain here
and protect our interests.

105
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:04,333
I have full confidence in your
ability to resolve this matter.

106
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:06,125
But, Commander, I--

107
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:10,000
No more excuses!
You will follow my orders!

108
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:13,166
You will destroy
the child. Is that clear?!

109
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:16,416
Clear. Crystal, sir.

110
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:21,208
Fight well, soldier,
and remember,

111
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:22,750
the honor of the Red Ribbon Army

112
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:25,208
rests squarely
on your shoulder.

113
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:34,416
Hm...

114
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,000
[crash]

115
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:46,208
Finally.

116
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:48,250
Are you the person in charge?

117
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:50,208
No, I'm not the Commander.

118
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:51,583
[GOKU]
Where is he?

119
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:54,250
He's safe. Now stop talking.
You will deal with me.

120
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:55,750
[GOKU]
Wait. I don't wanna fight you.

121
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:57,208
Just hand over the Dragon Balls.

122
00:09:57,291 --> 00:09:59,375
If you want to see the
Commander so badly,

123
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:01,250
I'll take you to him...

124
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:03,291
...in pieces.

125
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:05,791

[GOKU grunts, groans]

128
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:18,333
[RED growls]
Blast, the luck of that child!

129
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:21,250
But this will finish him!

130
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:22,375
[STAFF OFFICER grunts]

131
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:26,666
This is getting us nowhere.
I'll give you one more chance.

132
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:29,041
Hand over the Dragon Balls
and surrender.

133
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:30,625
No.

134
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:34,250
[GOKU] Okay, but let's finish
this soon. I'm ready for lunch.

135
00:10:38,916 --> 00:10:40,541
[GOKU yells]

136
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:42,708
[STAFF OFFICER groans]

137
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:48,291
So long! This is
where we say goodbye!

[RED cackling]

141
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:39,458
I live for moments like this!

142
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:08,666
[STAFF OFFICER grunting]
Commander...

143
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:12,125
How could you
betray me like this?

144
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:36,541
[RED cackling]

145
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:39,166
[RED] I don't really see
this as losing a foe,

146
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:42,916
but gaining four Dragon Balls!

147
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,791
Just one more ball...
Then at last...

148
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:51,166
My dream to be tall as a
mountain will come true!

149
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:54,625
[RED] Soon no one will ever
be able to look down

150
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:56,541
at Commander Red again.

151
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:59,125
I will become ruler
of all I can see.

152
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:02,708
And my eyes shall tower
over the heavens!

153
00:13:06,666 --> 00:13:07,583
[STAFF OFFICER]
Commander Red!

154
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:08,791
Huh?

155
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:11,833
[STAFF OFFICER]
What did you mean by that?

156
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:14,166
[RED]
You! You're still--

157
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:15,875
Alive? Yes, Commander,

158
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:19,166
sorry to disappoint you.
And I heard every word you said.

159
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:21,166
Do you mean all
of this was so that

160
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:23,375

I told the Commander
not to hurt you,

200

so he decided to
punish me as well.

When I learned you only
wanted the Dragon Balls,

he tried to kill me
to cover up his lie.

Well, why is he on
the floor? Is he asleep?

00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:05,250
[YAMCHA screams]

317
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:08,000
[VIOLET screams]

318
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:20,750
Did you get the license number?

319
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:22,750
Boy, I sure am
glad that's over.

320
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:24,500
Next time, we drive.

321
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,750
[GOKU yelps]

322
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:38,875
[GOKU yelping]

323
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:44,125
[GOKU grunts]

324
00:21:44,208 --> 00:21:46,958
[GOKU]
Hey! Who turned out the lights?!

325
00:21:47,041 --> 00:21:48,375
Let me go! Let me go!

326
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:51,083
[STAFF OFFICER laughs] It's time
to throw out the trash!

327
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:58,166
[GOKU groans, screams]

328
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:00,875
[STAFF OFFICER cackles]
That was easy!

329
00:22:00,958 --> 00:22:03,500
We shouldn't rely
on contract labor.

330
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:14,833
[GOKU groaning]

331
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:17,166
Now then, which one
of these features

332
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:19,916
haven't I tried yet...
Oh, a big red button.

333
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,708
That looks interesting.

334
00:22:31,916 --> 00:22:34,083
[STAFF OFFICER]
Goodnight, kid.

335
00:22:34,166 --> 00:22:36,208
[STAFF OFFICER cackles]

336
00:22:36,291 --> 00:22:39,458
[NARRATOR] Goku finds himself
at the mercy of a madman.

337
00:22:39,541 --> 00:22:41,875
Will his friends arrive
in time to save him?

338
00:22:41,958 --> 00:22:44,000
And what will become
of the Dragon Balls?

339
00:22:44,083 --> 00:22:46,916
The answers to these puzzling
questions and much more

340
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,541
will be revealed next
time on Dragon Ball!
