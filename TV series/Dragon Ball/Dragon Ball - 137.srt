Last time on Dragon Ball,

the battle between Mercenary Tao

when Tao used a weapon
to make his point.

His intention was to
destroy his former student.

Tien not only
immobilized his adversary,

00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:23,708
[ANNOUNCER]
These blissful youngsters

160
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:27,083
are the first opponents to
ever leave the ring as a couple.

161
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:29,583
Certainly, this is the
most surprising outcome

162
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:32,666
of any match in the
tournament's history.

163
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:37,083
[CHICHI]
How romantic!

164
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:47,166
I'm in love with you, Goku.

165
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:48,875
Love, what do you mean by that?

166
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:50,208
[CHICHI]
I'll show you.

[yelps]

168
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:59,958
Goku, have you lost all your
senses?! What are you doing?

169
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:24,958
[GOKU] ChiChi, please stop
squeezing my arm.

170
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:27,291
I can't walk with
you clinging to me.

171
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:29,875
[CHICHI]
Your shyness is adorable.

172
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:36,583
We're going to have a wonderful
future together, Goku.

173
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:38,875
Big family, lots of kids.

174
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:40,333
Kids?

175
00:13:40,416 --> 00:13:42,041
Not too many, eight or nine.

176
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:45,291
Wait till you see the house
father has been building for us!

177
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:47,541
Oh, he wanted it
to be a surprise!

178
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:49,833
This is all happening so fast.

179
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:53,250
[CHICHI] I know. I wish
it could last forever!

180
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:54,291
[KRILLIN]
Um...

[CHICHI laughs]

182
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:02,291
You must be one
of Goku's friends!

183
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:05,375
I'm his fiancée, ChiChi.
Nice to meet you.

184
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:07,250
Yeah, uh, likewise!

185
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:09,375
[CHICHI]
Hello again, Yamcha.

186

[YAMCHA grunts nervously]

187
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:13,541
You know her, Yamcha?
Why didn't you say something?

188
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:16,208
You're a sweet person,
and I know you're fond of me.

189
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:19,958
But, I'm sorry.
Goku is my true love.

[BULMA gasps]

191
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:24,208
[BULMA]
What is she talking about?

192
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:30,083
[YAMCHA] If you really wanna
know the truth, my darling,

193
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:31,625
I'm in love with you.

194
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:35,791
Ever since I first set
eyes on you. Truly.

195
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:40,250
Wow! You're in love with me?

196
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,875
Are you telling me the truth?

197
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:46,333
Just look at my face.

198
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:51,125
Listen, this all just
a misunderstanding.

199
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:52,916
Enlighten us.

200
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,333
Bulma, please! It's not
what you're thinking.

201
00:14:56,416 --> 00:14:59,291
When I met her, she was
just a little girl.

202
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:01,500
She was cute in a
sisterly sorta way.

203
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:04,000
She looked nothing like the
beautiful woman she is today.

204
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:04,916
Honest!

205
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,416
Oops! I shouldn't've said that.

206
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,833
Master Roshi, long time, no see!

207
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:13,708
You always were a
cantankerous old man.

[OOLONG chuckles]

209
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:18,958
Some of you I know quite well,
and some of you I've just met.

210
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:22,333
However, there is one thing
we all share in common:

211
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:25,500
a love for this wonderful man.

212
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:29,291
I'm so happy, I could pop!
I can't wait till we're married.

213
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:34,208
I'm going to be the best wife in
the world! Aren't you excited?

214
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:35,666
Uh, sure.

215

[CHICHI squeals] There's so
much to do. I'll be back!

Uh?

218
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:47,666
Your opponent in the next match
is no ordinary warrior.

219
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:50,125
Uh, how so?

220
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:52,458
Trust me. Keep your guard up.

Clear a path, people! Move!

It's time to leave
romance behind

224
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:15,083
and get back to the fighting!

Let's begin our third match.

Good luck, Krillin.

Thanks. I don't feel
much like fighting now.

230

What a show-off.

I'm waiting.
Attack at your leisure.

Oh, I'll attack. Don't worry.

And when I do, you'll wish you
had never entered this ring.

He's... powerful!

Say what you will, little man.

his composure

and now hovers
above the stadium!
