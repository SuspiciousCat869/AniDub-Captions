1
00:02:16,208 --> 00:02:19,416
[NARRATOR] Previously on
Dragon Ball, Launch's poisonous

2
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,666
pufferfish made everyone
except Goku sick.

3
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:25,375
Now, they're feeling better
and ready to commence

4
00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:27,208
their training at dawn.

5
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:30,625
[snoring]

6
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:32,083
[blow landing]

7
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:41,458
The boy kicks harder in his
sleep than he does in training.

8
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,875
[giggling]

9
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:12,416
[LAUNCH] Goku looks
so peaceful there.

10
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,083
I hope I don't sneeze
in my sleep and wake him.

11
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:18,500
Good food...

12
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:30,000
[NARRATOR] The boys better get
good sleep while they can,

13
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:33,541
because their first full day of
Turtle Hermit training starts

14
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:36,625
soon, and one thing is
for sure: it will be

15
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:39,500
filled with hard
work... and danger!

16
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:41,541
[LAUNCH] Ahh...choo!

17
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:53,541
[rooster crowing]

18
00:03:58,041 --> 00:03:59,416
[rooster crowing]

19
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:03,875
[alarm ringing]

20
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:07,041
I never can get
used to that alarm...

21
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:11,291
[ROSHI] Krillin! Wake up!
It's time to get started!

22
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:13,916
Early bird and the worm--
you know the saying!

23
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:23,000
I don't even think the
worms are awake yet...

24
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:24,125
[ROSHI] Nice try.

25
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:26,666
Now stop talking
and start dressing!

26
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,416
I'll go wake up Goku.

27
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:34,458
[ROSHI] Why should he get to
sleep with Launch while I'm

28
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:37,291
stuck down there with Krillin?

29
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:41,208
[ROSHI] If it weren't for those
blasted mood swings of hers...

30
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:44,208
[ROSHI] Oh, uh, a
little peek couldn't hurt...

31
00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:52,208
[lecherous chuckling]

32
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:06,666
[ROSHI] Quietly, Roshi...
Oh, so quietly!

33
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:11,416
[ROSHI] Look at Goku lying
next to Launch, so snug!

34
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,541
If it weren't for her infernal
head cold, I would've...

35
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:17,125
It's tough to see such
beauty wasted on the young!

36
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:22,250
Mmm... So
hungry... Mmm...

37
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:25,375
[ROSHI] Hmm, I wonder what
Launch wears when she sleeps?

38
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,291
[ROSHI] Only one
way to find out!

39
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:34,583
[ROSHI] Oh no! She must
have sneezed in her sleep!

40
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:37,125
I don't want to be the one to
interrupt her dream cycle!

41
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:38,750
That would be a nightmare!

42
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:43,666
[ROSHI] Goku...

43
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:49,750
Wake... up...

44
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:52,250
[ROSHI] Be very quiet...

45
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:56,583
[GOKU] Good morning,
Master Roshi!

46
00:05:56,666 --> 00:05:59,208
[ROSHI] Shh! Shh!

47
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:04,250
Master, what's wrong?

48
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:06,291
[ROSHI] Shh!
Don't wake Launch!

49
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:07,750
[LAUNCH] Mmm?

50
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:10,250
[LAUNCH growling]

51
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:11,708
[ROSHI yelling]

52
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,250
Hi!

53
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:20,958
What are you doing in
my bed, you pervert?!

54
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:24,625
I slept here, sir.
We only have two blankets.

55
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:26,791
[LAUNCH growling]

56
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:29,000
[LAUNCH] Lame excuse,
you little hedgehog!

57
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:31,291
Hah!

58
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:42,083
Launch! What'cha do that for?!

59
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:46,500
That'll teach you to get under
a blanket while it's in my bed!

60
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:51,458
[GOKU] Haah!

61
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:53,208
Yaah!

62
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:56,875
That's not very nice!

63
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:01,583
Goku, you really shouldn't
play so rough with girls.

64
00:07:01,666 --> 00:07:06,041
You must learn to be
gentle with the young ladies.

65
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:07,708
Master Roshi,
I've waited so long.

66
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:10,083
Can we please start training?

67
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:12,750
Oh! Train--uh, training,
yes, right, right!

68
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:15,291
I came to talk to you
about, uh, training!

69
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:19,166
[nervously chuckling]

70
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:21,500
[ROSHI] Think fast,
Roshi. Think fast!

71
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:28,791
Strong wind from the south-west,
barometer high, but falling.

72
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:31,166
Feels like perfect
weather for training.

73
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:33,166
Yay!

74
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:38,333
[ROSHI] Today, we embark
on our study of the

75
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,666
martial arts together.

76
00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:46,583
Before we begin, there is
something very important

77
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:47,666
you boys should know.

78
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,000
[GOKU and KRILLIN] What?

79
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:51,500
We do not learn martial
arts to pick fights or to

80
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:55,125
impress girls who will say: "Oh,
beefcake, you're so strong!

81
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:56,583
I want you!"

82
00:07:57,958 --> 00:08:00,250
Do you understand
what I am saying?

83
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:06,333
We must master the art of peace
in addition to the art of war.

84
00:08:06,416 --> 00:08:08,708
We achieve victory
by the arts of war.

85
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:10,666
Victory is won through strategy.

86
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:13,958
Strategy is derived
from the arts of peace.

87
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:20,416
However, if somebody
evil threatens you,

88
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:24,208
or any other good, innocent
people with unethical force,

89
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:26,875
it is your duty to defend!

90
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:28,833
[ROSHI] Do you understand?

91
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:30,291
Yes!

92
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:32,541
Uh, can you repeat that?

93
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:34,666
[KRILLIN and ROSHI] Oh boy...

94
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:40,916
What I mean is that we
learn how to fight so that

95
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,500
we won't have to. We strive to
maintain peace in the universe.

96
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:49,375
Oh, I get it now! I
think I can understand that!

97
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:51,916
Didn't even need pictures...

98
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,083
So, we're ready now for
Turtle Hermit Training?

99
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:56,541
[GOKU and KRILLIN] Yes!

100
00:08:57,833 --> 00:09:00,375
Are you boys sure that
you're prepared for my

101
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:01,958
rigorous training schedule?

102
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,458
[GOKU and KRILLIN] Yes, sir!

103
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:07,375
Fine, then we'll warm
up with a brief run.

104
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:08,833
Follow me!

105
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:30,250
[KRILLIN] I heard Master
Roshi's training was tough,

106
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:32,416
but I haven't even
broken a sweat yet.

107
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,916
[GOKU laughing]

108
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:47,958
[ROSHI] Now halt.
Good morning!

109
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:51,875
[ROSHI] I'm Master Roshi.
I believe we spoke yesterday.

110
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:55,583
Of course. I recognize
your voice from the phone!

111
00:09:57,333 --> 00:10:00,666
This is the delivery
route I usually take. See?

112
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,250
[ROSHI] Alright.
I think I've got it.

113
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:04,791
That's... a whole lot of milk.

114
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:09,166
Yeah! I sure hope it's all for
us, 'coz I'm really thirsty!

115
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:15,166
Ready, boys? You can each
take one of these crates to

116
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,291
deliver across the countryside.

117
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:20,041
We're delivering milk?

118
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:23,958
It's a good way to
train our bodies.

119
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:27,666
Um, does that mean
you're all going on foot?

120
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:31,958
But sir, I've got a helicopter.

121
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:35,416
Flying in comfort would hardly
be training, now would it?

122
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:39,291
But every bottle has to be
delivered by breakfast time.

123
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:40,791
Don't worry, my friend.

124
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:43,333
I'll have them moving
like lightning!

125
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:45,958
Boys! Come grab a crate!

126
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:47,416
[GOKU and KRILLIN] Yes, sir!

127
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:53,375
Master Roshi, how can
milk delivery be training?

128
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:55,375
Just wait and see, kid.

129
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Now, let's take
it easy for today.

130
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:03,125
[ROSHI] Why don't we skip
the three miles to the

131
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:04,958
first house on our list?

132
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:08,125
Three miles?!

133
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:09,583
[GOKU] Skip?

134
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:18,583
[ROSHI] Skip, two, three, four.
Skip, two, three, four.

135
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:22,833
[GOKU and KRILLIN] Skip,
two, three, four.

136
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:24,958
[ALL] Skip, two, three, four.

137
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:26,208
[ROSHI] Skip, two, three--

138
00:11:26,291 --> 00:11:27,875
[KRILLIN] How much
further, Master?

139
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:29,916
[ROSHI] Only two
and a half miles!

140
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,333
[ROSHI] Skip, two, three, four.
Skip, two, three, four.

141
00:11:35,416 --> 00:11:39,833
Skip, two, three, four!
Skip, two, three, four!

142
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:42,250
Skip... Skip... Skip...

143
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:50,083
[ROSHI] Come on, Krillin!
We can't have stragglers!

144
00:11:57,375 --> 00:12:00,041
Good! We're off to a good start!

145
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:02,125
Now, for the
next two miles...

146
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:05,375
You mean there's more?!

147
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:06,958
Of course there is!

148
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:09,500
[whimpering]

149
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:12,250
Here, how 'bout we
zigzag between the

150
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:13,583
trees along this path?

151
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:15,041
Huh?!

152
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:18,708
Zigzag? What's that?

153
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:20,666
[ROSHI] When you're ready, go!

154
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:24,250
Now zigzag!

155
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,375
[ROSHI] Chant with me boys!

156
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:31,958
[GOKU and ROSHI] Zig, two, zag,
four! Zig, two, zag, four!

157
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:36,000
[KRILLIN panting heavily]

158
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:41,125
[GOKU and ROSHI] Zig, two, zag,
four! Zig, two, zag, four!

159
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:43,833
[KRILLIN] Hmm...

160
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:45,875
Zig, two, zag, four!

161
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:48,916
[KRILLIN] Krillin,
you're a genius!

162
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,500
Zig, two, zag, four!

163
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:54,375
Zig, two, zag, four...
Zig, two, zag, four!

164
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:56,041
[chanting continues]

165
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:57,333
[ROSHI] Krillin?!

166
00:12:57,416 --> 00:12:59,166
I'll start over, sir!

167
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:03,708
[chuckling]

168
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,125
[GOKU] Here's your
new home, Mr. Bottle.

169
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:28,291
[panting]

170
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:31,000
If you don't move your
legs faster, Krillin,

171
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:33,041
the milk is going to curdle!

172
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:37,958
[whining]

173
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:40,791
Krillin! Did I say
that you could rest?!

174
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:44,583
That's better.

175
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:47,291
You've earned a break from
running. We're going to climb

176
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:49,125
a few stairs instead.

177
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:54,625
[KRILLIN] Finally, I can catch
my breath and take it easy.

178
00:13:57,666 --> 00:13:59,041
[KRILLIN] A few steps?!

179
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:12,375
I may have been hasty
when I said Master Roshi's

180
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:13,833
training wasn't so tough...

181
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:23,083
[GOKU] Why can't I
drink the milk?!

182
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:38,875
[ROSHI] Ah, there's nothing
more relaxing than the

183
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:40,291
fresh air of nature.

184
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:41,750
Hmm?

185
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:48,000
Well, it looks like even
Goku has his limits.

186
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:52,875
[GOKU] Master Roshi,
couldn't I go faster

187
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:55,333
with the Nimbus Cloud?

188
00:14:55,416 --> 00:14:57,666
Would that challenge
your abilities, Goku?

189
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,541
I guess not...

190
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:05,958
[GOKU] It's just that I'm so
tired of climbing stairs...

191
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:11,125
Did you know? Ox-King and your
grandfather Gohan used to carry

192
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:14,416
crates up these mountains
all the time, and not once

193
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,375
did they ever complain to me.

194
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:23,583
What? My grandfather
delivered milk here? Like me?

195
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:32,833
I'll meet you at the top,
Master!

196
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:39,333
Worked like a charm.

197
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:46,041
Good job!
You're half way there!

198
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:48,291
H-Half...?

199
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:53,125
[KRILLIN] I could've sworn I was
at least three half-ways there!

200
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:56,291
[KRILLIN] Each step
feels like my last!

201
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,916
[GOKU] My grandfather
would never stop...

202
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:07,083
[KRILLIN] I can't let Goku
humiliate me again...

203
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:09,666
I gotta make it all the way...

204
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:10,916
[GOKU] At the top...

205
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:12,208
[KRILLIN] At last...

206
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:15,708
Delivered before
breakfast.

207
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:19,833
Thank you. Would you
like a cup of milk, friends?

208
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:21,291
I do!

209
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:24,458
Why did you make my
head ouch like that?

210
00:16:24,541 --> 00:16:26,958
You don't give milk
then take it back!

211
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:29,541
Oh... No thank you, mister Monk.

212
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:34,708
Master Roshi, it's been
ages since you've trained.

213
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:37,958
[ROSHI] Yes, it
has. It's nice to see you again.

214
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:40,750
Always nice to visit
with old friends.

215
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,458
How is the training of
these young ones going?

216
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:46,291
It's too early for
me to say, really.

217
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:49,458
But I think that they
are showing great promise.

218
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:52,291
Did you hear that?!

219
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,833
"Great promise"!

220
00:16:54,916 --> 00:16:57,500
If they get themselves in gear,
they'll be ready for the

221
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:59,541
World Martial
Arts Tournament.

222
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:02,666
Oh, that's only eight
months from today!

223
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:05,500
The World Martial
Arts Tournament?!

224
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:07,416
What is that?

225
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:11,166
Are you saying you
never heard of it?!

226
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:13,416
[KRILLIN] That's where all the
greatest fighters in the whole

227
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,291
wide world meet up and compete
with each other to determine

228
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:17,750
who is the absolute best!

229
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:20,541
The absolute best? That's great!

230
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:23,041
And they only hold
this tournament once

231
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,833
every five years.

232
00:17:24,916 --> 00:17:26,791
[GOKU] Oh, how exciting!

233
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:30,083
[KRILLIN] Only eight
finalists can participate

234
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:32,958
in the tournament. But, hundreds
of contestants show up every

235
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:37,291
five years to try and make it
past the elimination rounds.

236
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:39,500
[GOKU] That sounds like fun!

237
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,166
[KRILLIN] I've heard
that the competition's

238
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:46,083
extremely difficult, and
some battles really heat up!

239
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:52,500
I wish I could enter...

240
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:55,916
Well, Master Roshi, will we
really be ready to fight?

241
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,708
Only if you boys
train diligently.

242
00:17:58,791 --> 00:18:01,291
Sounds like quite
an incentive...

243
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:02,916
[GOKU and KRILLIN] Yaay!

244
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,291
[ROSHI] But...

245
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:07,500
You will not go in there
with hopes of winning the

246
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:10,791
tournament the first time
you compete. To do so

247
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:14,791
would be arrogant. And arrogance
is for fools, not warriors.

248
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:17,583
So you will enter the tournament
with the sole purpose of

249
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:19,000
improving your fighting skills.

250
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:22,708
I can't wait! This
is gonna be so exciting!

251
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:25,541
And by then we're
gonna be so strong!

252
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:27,791
Not if they don't finish
delivering the rest

253
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:29,375
of the milk today...

254
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:31,708
Respect Master Roshi.

255
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:33,166
[GOKU and KRILLIN] Yes!

256
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:38,166
[NARRATOR] While Goku and
Krillin's minds filled with big

257
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:42,041
dreams of the World Martial Arts
Tournament, a familiar face

258
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:45,833
far away was also
preparing for the big event.

259
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:49,250
[VOICE] Haa-chaa!

260
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:52,166
[grunting]

261
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:54,875
[screaming]

262
00:18:55,916 --> 00:18:57,291
Next!

263
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,625
[NARRATOR] That man
preparing was Yamcha,

264
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:03,291
the one-time Desert Bandit.

265
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:09,791
[BULMA] You can do it, Yamcha!
Knock him out! Take him!

266
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:11,291
[PUAR] Oh, be careful!

267
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:16,500
[MAN] Me next!

268
00:19:18,041 --> 00:19:20,375
You think you can take me?

269
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:32,125
Why won't you stand
still you little coward,

270
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:34,500
and fight once like
a real man, huh?

271
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:36,333
Not tough enough, is that it?

272
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:38,833
That beast is going
to beat Yamcha!

273
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:40,791
Well, don't blame
the beast, Bulma.

274
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:44,625
Yamcha did knock out
twenty of his friends!

275
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:48,125
Oh, Puar, can't
you do anything?!

276
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:51,333
Don't worry.
My Yamcha can defend himself.

277
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:55,750
[YAMCHA] Hey there, pal. Do
you wanna see my Wolf Fang Fist?

278
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:57,583
Your what?

279
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:01,708
You'll see.

280
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:06,916
Wolf Fang Fist!

281
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,541
[wolf howling]

282
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:15,083
[screaming]

283
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:22,875
[ALL] Yay! Yamcha did it!

284
00:20:22,958 --> 00:20:25,791
I knew Yamcha would win,
just like he'll at the

285
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:27,500
World Martial Arts Tournament!

286
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,708
But Puar, shouldn't you
be worried about Goku?

287
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:32,833
He's somewhere training
with Master Roshi!

288
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:35,125
Yeah, that Goku's
no wet noodle.

289
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:38,208
He's not as strong as Yamcha!

290
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,833
[YAMCHA] This simply will
not do! The competitors

291
00:20:43,916 --> 00:20:47,291
in the Tournament will be
much tougher than this big oaf.

292
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:50,291
Goku, please show up!
I've got something

293
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:51,916
I wanna share with you.

294
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:56,000
He's such a stud!

295
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:00,208
[ROSHI] Careful, boys. One
foot in front of the other.

296
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:02,875
Now, balance. Balance!

297
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:07,166
[screaming]

298
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:10,541
[ROSHI] Concentrate!

299
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:13,458
[ROSHI] And no whining!

300
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:15,500
Breakfast time
is almost here!

301
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:20,000
Who cares about breakfast when
you're falling down a pit?

302
00:21:23,166 --> 00:21:25,500
[GOKU] I think I'm
thirstier than he is!

303
00:21:25,583 --> 00:21:27,083
[KRILLIN] Me too...

304
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:31,208
Hurry boys, step lively,
otherwise this sand is

305
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:33,041
gonna swallow you whole!

306
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:39,375
Just... think... of... the...

307
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:43,333
[KRILLIN] World... Martial...
Arts... Tournament...

308
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:53,208
[ROSHI] Stand firm, boys.
Don't fall with the water.

309
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:56,416
[GOKU] All the greatest fighters
in the world will be there!

310
00:21:58,708 --> 00:22:01,916
Not... fall...
in... ri--!

311
00:22:03,541 --> 00:22:04,875
The water!

312
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:10,750
[screaming]

313
00:22:10,833 --> 00:22:13,250
[growling]

314
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:16,416
Must go faster, boys, if you
don't want him to eat you alive!

315
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,041
Hurry, hurry!

316
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:25,458
[ROSHI] Good job, Goku.
You too, Krillin.

317
00:22:29,916 --> 00:22:32,666
You'll deliver milk like
this each day for the

318
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:36,750
next eight months. That will be
your early morning training.

319
00:22:36,833 --> 00:22:39,791
Now then, let's start
the mid-morning training!

320
00:22:39,875 --> 00:22:41,500
[GOKU] What?

321
00:22:41,583 --> 00:22:44,708
[NARRATOR] As Goku and Krillin
have found, Master Roshi's

322
00:22:44,791 --> 00:22:48,083
training is tough indeed.
And it's just beginning!

323
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:51,708
But with the World Martial
Arts Tournament in the air,

324
00:22:51,791 --> 00:22:54,583
it just might be worth it!
