1
00:02:13,375 --> 00:02:16,625
[NARRATOR] Previously on Dragon
Ball, a mysterious girl named

2
00:02:16,708 --> 00:02:20,500
Launch joined Goku and Krillin
on Master Roshi's island.

3
00:02:20,583 --> 00:02:25,375
And now the friendly foursome is
packing up for a new adventure.

4
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:28,333
How're we gonna get there?

5
00:02:28,666 --> 00:02:31,458
[GOKU] It'll be a tight
squeeze on the Nimbus Cloud.

6
00:02:31,541 --> 00:02:33,041
This will cut it!

7
00:02:35,208 --> 00:02:37,541
[NARRATOR] The old teacher
has finally agreed to train

8
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:41,125
Goku and Krillin, and so they're
moving to a larger island.

9
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:48,541
[ROSHI] Master Roshi's
rule number one:

10
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:50,458
Travel in style!

11
00:02:57,416 --> 00:03:00,291
[ROSHI] Can you do me a favor,
Launch?

12
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:01,416
[LAUNCH] Huh?

13
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:06,083
Well, uh, try not
to sneeze, kay?

14
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:07,833
Yes, I'll try!

15
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:12,083
[NARRATOR] Master Roshi's
request has nothing to do with

16
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:15,416
hygiene. As he and the
boys learned the hard way,

17
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,208
Launch goes through an
amazing transformation

18
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:22,666
every time she sneezes.
Changing from a gentle girl

19
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:26,041
to a vengeful vixen with
an itchy trigger-finger!

20
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:29,083
And she won't be pushed around!

21
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:31,458
[LAUNCH] Wanna dress
me like a doll?

22
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:34,125
Then please,
don't forget...

23
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:36,125
[LAUNCH] the accessory
machine gun!

24
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:42,583
[screaming]

25
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:49,833
[NARRATOR] Needless to say,
Master Roshi, Goku, and Krillin

26
00:03:49,916 --> 00:03:52,916
will be staying on their
toes. But hey, there's

27
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,666
plenty of reason to smile!
Now that Master Roshi has a

28
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:59,416
girl to keep him company,
the boys will learn the

29
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,750
ways of martial arts!
Training starts today

30
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:05,083
on Dragon Ball!

31
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:28,125
[ROSHI] Anyone up
for a short martial arts

32
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:29,458
lesson before dinner?

33
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:30,916
[KRILLIN] Of course, Master!

34
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,166
[ROSHI] Yes, I find
it helps digestion.

35
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:34,958
Hey, where's Goku?!

36
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:38,250
[LAUNCH] Oh, I know! He
said he'd have a look

37
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:41,750
around the island, and then he
went off on that funny cloud.

38
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:45,041
Wooaah...

39
00:04:56,958 --> 00:04:58,125
[GOKU] Yeah!

40
00:04:58,208 --> 00:04:59,583
[laughing]

41
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:01,541
[GOKU] Wa-hoo!

42
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:03,833
[laughing]

43
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:24,666
Master Roshi, I think
someone beat us to the island.

44
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:27,208
[ROSHI] About three hundred
someones to be exact.

45
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:31,125
But don't worry, they just live
here. They're not competition.

46
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:33,875
Now, let's have a lesson!

47
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:37,625
You mean it?!

48
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:41,583
Yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah!
Yeah-yeah!

49
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:43,958
[KRILLIN] Hmph, what a child!

50
00:05:44,041 --> 00:05:47,291
Just wait 'til he sees
what a real fighter can do.

51
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:50,000
Should I be
training too?

52
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:53,208
[ROSHI] Uh? That's up to you,
as long as we can hide

53
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:54,958
the machine gun...

54
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:57,791
Well, I guess I'll
train if you guys are.

55
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,583
Ah... ah... ah...!

56
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,750
[screaming]

57
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,625
[yawning]

58
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:10,125
[ROSHI] Eh?

59
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:12,541
[LAUNCH] Actually,
fighting puts me to sleep!

60
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:14,375
I'll go make some food!

61
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:18,708
Guess she was
just yawning...

62
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:20,416
That was scary!

63
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,458
Krillin, how dare
you be scared!

64
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:25,125
A martial arts expert
must never be afraid!

65
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:29,041
[KRILLIN] Sorry.
I'll try to be more like you.

66
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:32,416
Now, let's continue with
our fearless training.

67
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:35,583
[ROSHI] Krillin, do you have
any fighting experience?

68
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:40,083
Yes, I studied for eight years
at the Magic Orin Temple!

69
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:43,291
[ROSHI] Alright, then,
very good. I suppose

70
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:46,375
I can skip the lesson on what
a punch and a kick are.

71
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:49,041
[ROSHI] Now, before I teach
you boys anything new,

72
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:52,166
I'll need to test your
current ability.

73
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:55,708
[ROSHI] Let's see...
We'll start from over here...

74
00:06:55,791 --> 00:07:00,791
and finish at that tree. That's
about a hundred meters, right?

75
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:02,958
[ROSHI] Where's my stopwatch?!

76
00:07:03,041 --> 00:07:04,541
You want us to race?

77
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:07,833
[ROSHI] Running is a good test
of speed and strength, though of

78
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:10,416
course if you're an expert
fighter, you shouldn't be the

79
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,750
one who has to run away.

80
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:14,250
[chuckling]

81
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:17,083
I'll run first, Master Roshi.

82
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:19,375
[ROSHI] Ooh, confident, are ya?

83
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:22,625
Well, you'll both see why.
I could probably

84
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:24,833
make the Olympics...
if I wanted to.

85
00:07:28,416 --> 00:07:30,083
On your mark!

86
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,125
[KRILLIN] Hmm...

87
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:38,833
[ROSHI] Get set!

88
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:41,916
[GOKU laughing]

89
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,375
Hit it!

90
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:48,333
[panting]

91
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:54,750
My, my! You ran it in
ten-point-four seconds!

92
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:57,583
Well, that's...
pretty darn good.

93
00:07:57,666 --> 00:08:00,416
Yeah, yeah...
It's an okay run...

94
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,250
I usually make it
around ten-point-one.

95
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:06,791
I don't know what happened, but
I guess the wind was against me!

96
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:11,041
[GOKU] Yoo-hoo! Master Roshi!

97
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:13,375
[GOKU] Can I take
a turn at it now?!

98
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:16,416
[ROSHI] Well,
let's not get antsy!

99
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,833
[ROSHI] Now, on your mark.

100
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:19,708
[ROSHI] Get set!

101
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:21,541
What an amateur.

102
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:23,000
Go!

103
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:25,250
[GOKU] Uh?

104
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,541
Maybe he's a bit
faster than I thought...

105
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:34,250
Let's see, now... looks
like eleven seconds even.

106
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:37,083
That's a good finish,
but Krillin, I'd say you still

107
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:38,541
beat him hands down.

108
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:42,166
Oh, it's really not
fair to compare him to me.

109
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:45,500
[KRILLIN] I set the bar
pretty high, you know.

110
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:49,625
Yes, well, for rookies,
you both have good potential.

111
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:53,041
[GOKU] Master Roshi, can I try
again with different shoes?

112
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:57,750
Don't be a sore loser
and try blame your shoes, Goku.

113
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:00,458
Look at mine.

114
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:03,291
They're not exactly meant for
running either, now are they?

115
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:06,208
But at least yours
aren't all torn up.

116
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:07,875
[GOKU] I can see my toes!

117
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:12,333
[GOKU laughing]

118
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:14,458
Ha! Much Better!

119
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:16,958
Okay! I'm ready!

120
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:18,041
[ROSHI] Alright!

121
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:20,166
Get on your mark!

122
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:21,625
[ROSHI] Get set!

123
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:25,333
[ROSHI] Go!

124
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:31,958
[KRILLIN whimpering]

125
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:34,250
Wow. Eight seconds flat.

126
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,875
Was I fast?

127
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:42,708
Who... taught you
how to-to run like that?

128
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:44,791
What do you mean?
No one taught me.

129
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,291
That'd be silly!

130
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:50,958
Well, for two young men, you're
at the top of your league.

131
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:52,291
[chuckling]

132
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:54,833
[ROSHI] But that's
not good enough!

133
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:58,375
[ROSHI] See boys, to be truly
great fighters, you must learn

134
00:09:58,458 --> 00:10:00,625
to go beyond the
limits of normal people.

135
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:02,833
And that's no cakewalk.

136
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:06,833
[ROSHI] I'll let you
be the timekeeper.

137
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:08,750
And whose time am I keeping?

138
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:12,791
Mine, of course.
I just hope I'm still in shape.

139
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:17,541
[grunting]

140
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:22,375
[GOKU] Okay, Master Roshi,
are you ready?!

141
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:25,458
[ROSHI] That's a
good question...

142
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:32,083
[ROSHI] Oh yeah!
I think I'm ready!

143
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:33,958
[KRILLIN] Okay!
Then, on your mark!

144
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:35,416
Get set...!

145
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:38,458
Go!

146
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:42,958
That's moving!

147
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:44,708
What's my time?

148
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:48,458
Five-point-six seconds!

149
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:53,041
Five-and-six tenths, huh?
Not too bad.

150
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:55,333
Can you teach us to do that?!

151
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:57,708
[ROSHI] What, throw a
purple turtle shell?

152
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:01,791
[ROSHI] Oh, right,
the running. Of course!

153
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:05,333
It's just a matter of surpassing
normal human limitations.

154
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:10,000
Gee, all that running
made my tongue dry.

155
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:12,541
[ROSHI] Goku, grab me a brewsky!

156
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:15,166
Okay... What's a brewsky?

157
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:17,000
Don't worry,
Master, I gotcha!

158
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:24,458
Ugh, Goku, I have many things
to teach you besides fighting.

159
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:28,208
Now, are you sure you
weren't raised in a bubble?

160
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:30,958
[laughing]

161
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:33,583
Oh, wow! Master Roshi
really is strong!

162
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:36,250
He's not just a dirty,
old man after all!

163
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:40,333
[KRILLIN] Launch!
Which way is the refrigerator?

164
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:42,541
[LAUNCH] Careful!
You're blowing up dust!

165
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:43,833
[KRILLIN] What?

166
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:47,666
[LAUNCH] Ah... Ah... Ah-choo!

167
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:50,041
That's no yawn!

168
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:52,041
[LAUNCH] Slow down,
you little pig!

169
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:53,541
[KRILLIN screaming]

170
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:56,208
[LAUNCH] How's about I
cook you for dinner?!

171
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:59,666
Oh, look at that! Krillin
just ran the hundred-meter

172
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,125
in just eight-point-eight
seconds!

173
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:03,291
That's much better than before!

174
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:05,916
[LAUNCH] You can't run forever,
you little porker!

175
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,166
[LAUNCH] Ah-choo!

176
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:13,041
Oh, that's funny, I thought
for sure I was in the kitchen!

177
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:15,250
[LAUNCH] Oh, look,
I dropped my knife!

178
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:18,375
[KRILLIN whimpering]

179
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:33,791
[ROSHI] And that's a brief
explanation of how to go

180
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:37,375
beyond your limits.
Am I making any sense?

181
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:39,083
[GOKU] Mm-hmm!

182
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:43,416
[ROSHI] Good. Then we'll work
on applying it tomorrow morning.

183
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,958
Now, you boys have one more
task to perform before we go

184
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:49,833
inside to that wonderful
smelling supper!

185
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:51,666
Are we running?

186
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:55,083
[ROSHI] No, it's a
different kind of test.

187
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:03,083
[ROSHI] Take a good
look at this stone.

188
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:04,875
[ROSHI] Have you memorized it?

189
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:06,375
I think so.

190
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:08,416
Are you going to eat it?

191
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,875
[ROSHI] What? No, Goku!

192
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:17,625
Oh, yeah! Still got the old arm.

193
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:21,125
The test is to throw stones?

194
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:24,458
Master Roshi, your training
sure is kind of weird.

195
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:27,750
Throwing stones is
not the test here.

196
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:28,791
[GOKU and KRILLIN] Huh

197
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:31,291
The test is to find mine.

198
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:34,250
Wha--?

199
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:36,583
You mean the one you just threw?

200
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:39,791
[ROSHI] Anyone can throw
a stone, just like anyone

201
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:41,333
can throw a punch.

202
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:46,041
But to find a stone takes a
focused mind and a calm spirit.

203
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:49,833
This is what will separate
you from the others.

204
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:53,708
[ROSHI] And so, the person who
finds it can keep the stone,

205
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:57,833
and the one who doesn't
can keep their appetite.

206
00:13:57,916 --> 00:14:01,041
[GOKU and KRILLIN]
You mean... no supper?!

207
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:02,500
[ROSHI] That's right!

208
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:06,583
And if no one brings the
stone back in thirty minutes,

209
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:09,041
then neither of
you gets to eat!

210
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:12,500
Now, hurry up, boys!
Time's already started!

211
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:15,291
[ROSHI] Watch out for snakes!

212
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:20,000
[shouting]

213
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:23,250
[KRILLIN] Darn it!
There's no way down!

214
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:26,083
We'd better find
a detour, quick!

215
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:32,333
[GOKU laughing]

216
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:34,125
Are you crazy?!

217
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:38,583
Don't worry! I did this all the
time back in the mountains!

218
00:14:41,416 --> 00:14:42,791
Haah!

219
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:45,500
[GOKU screaming]

220
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:49,125
Ooh, that one really hurt!

221
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:50,625
[GOKU] But I've got
to get my supper!

222
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,583
[GOKU] Hello, stone!
Where are you?!

223
00:14:54,666 --> 00:14:56,625
[KRILLIN] That guy
can't be human!

224
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:59,291
And now he's way ahead of me!

225
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:02,166
[panicked wailing]

226
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:03,708
Hmm...

227
00:15:03,791 --> 00:15:07,083
[KRILLIN] Hold up, there's no
way I can find that stone in

228
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:11,750
half an hour, especially with
Goku taking leaps like that.

229
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:14,833
[KRILLIN] Maybe there's a...

230
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:18,000
[snickering]

231
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:21,708
[KRILLIN] Ooh,
you sly, sly dog.

232
00:15:21,791 --> 00:15:23,083
[snickering]

233
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:25,541
[sniffing]

234
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,250
Ahh, fortune smiles on Krillin.

235
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:35,166
[KRILLIN] Hello!
Hello! Man at the door!

236
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:39,125
Hmm... where's the man?

237
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:42,166
[KRILLIN] I'm the man, ma'am,
and I need to borrow a pen!

238
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:44,000
It's an emergency!

239
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:45,333
A pen?

240
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:46,875
[KRILLIN] Yes, please.

241
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:50,250
[sniffing]

242
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:52,958
Smells like sweat
and turtle shell.

243
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:54,166
I'm closer.

244
00:15:56,916 --> 00:15:58,500
Perfect-o!

245
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,958
Thank you!

246
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:04,375
[KRILLIN laughing]

247
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:06,458
[WOMAN] Tiny, little thing...

248
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:09,458
Now, all I have to do is
act like I had a really

249
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:10,958
hard time finding it!

250
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:12,541
[chuckling]

[LAUNCH humming]

252
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:20,458
[ROSHI] Now, this
is a magic moment...

253
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:23,708
[LAUNCH humming]

254
00:16:23,791 --> 00:16:26,875
So, Launch, whatcha
shaking up for dinner?

255
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:29,791
[LAUNCH] Stew! I got a
really good deal from a

256
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:32,041
man at the fish market.

257
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:37,583
Ohh... great...
sounds tasty...

[excited grunting]

00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:46,458
Master Roshi!

261
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:47,916
[LAUNCH] Huh?

262
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,833
[panting]

263
00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:50,791

00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:56,750
Huh?

267
00:16:56,833 --> 00:16:59,541
What... were you doing?

268
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:02,791
[ROSHI laughing]

269
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:04,208
[ROSHI] G-Gotta go!

[panting]

271
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,208
[KRILLIN] It was hard,
but I found it.

272
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:13,333
Good job. Very quick!

273
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:23,875
Nice try, lame-o, but
that's not my handwriting!

274
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,166
[ROSHI] Now get out!

275
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:27,625
[KRILLIN] Sorry!

276
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:35,875
Man, I'll never find,
anything in this jungle.

00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:46,833
Huh?

[deep growling]

281
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:59,791
What kind of a jungle am I in?!

00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:01,541
[GOKU laughing]

283
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:03,958
[GOKU] I found it!

284
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:07,000
Oh! It's Goku!

285
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:09,041
Stay right where
you are, Goku!

286
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:12,666
I'm coming your way!
Please don't go anywhere!

287
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:18,000
I found it! Mmm...
Now, I can have my supper!

288
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:21,375
How in the world did
you find that, Goku?!

289
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:24,083
It smells like Master Roshi!

290
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:25,666
What are you, a dog?!

291
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:29,500
Wait. I think that
stone might be a decoy.

292
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:31,875
What do you mean?
It has his handwriting

293
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:33,375
on it and everything!

294
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:37,583
Lots of stuff has his writing
on it! He owns this place!

295
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:39,166
Oh, really?

296
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:41,000
I'll check it for you.

[GOKU] You're cheating!
Give me back that stone!

301
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:54,208
I'm sorry, Goku!
But I stole it fair and square!

Well, here I go!

Let's brawl!

I'd love to!

315

But first, you have to
promise you won't cry

to Master Roshi if I cause
you death or permanent injury

fight once without cheating!

00:19:56,958 --> 00:20:00,375
[blows landing]

320
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:04,083
[shouting]

321
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:07,375
[whimpering]

322
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:08,833
You give up?

323
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:09,916
Oh yeah!

324
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,208
Then you have to
give the stone back.

325
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:16,875
Well, I can't argue with you.
The rock is rightfully yours.

326
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:18,875
So... take it!

327
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:21,291
[GOKU screaming]

328
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,666
[GOKU] Wait up, stone!

329
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:26,291
[KRILLIN guffawing]

330
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:29,833
And that's what I call...
smooth!

331
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:34,375
[ROSHI] Hmm...

332
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:36,375
[softly chuckling]

333
00:20:37,708 --> 00:20:40,875
[ROSHI] I know I shouldn't,
but...

334
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:44,125
[ROSHI grunting]

335
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:47,125
[ROSHI] So... close...

336
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:48,583
I've got it!

337
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,541
Do you time this?!

338
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:56,291
But now I've got the real one!

339
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:06,125
What do you know? This
one is real. Good job, Krillin.

340
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:07,750
[ROSHI] You've
redeemed yourself!

341
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:09,625
Yes, thank you.

342
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:14,333
[laughing]

343
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:16,166
[ROSHI] Dig in, Krillin!

344
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,208
[LAUNCH] Do you like it?

345
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:19,666
You bet!

346
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:23,000
Would you like more to
drink, Master Roshi?

347
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:24,833
Oh-ho, you read my mind!

348
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:29,083
Well, I didn't know you were
such a gourmet cook, Launch!

349
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:30,458
Thank you very much!

350
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:32,000
Just thank the fish!

351
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:34,041
[laughing]

352
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:35,750
[KRILLIN] Oh, thank you, fish!

353
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:37,375
[GOKU moaning]

354
00:21:37,458 --> 00:21:40,833
Yummy! What's in
this tasty stew?

355
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:43,958
[LAUNCH] Let's see...
what did that man call it?

356
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:46,291
Oh! It's a puffer fish!

357
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:47,750
[KRILLIN] Hmm?!

358
00:21:52,916 --> 00:21:55,000
Puf...fer fish?

359
00:21:55,083 --> 00:21:57,458
[ROSHI] But that's... poisonous!

360
00:21:57,541 --> 00:21:59,875
Oh, I... feel ill.

361
00:22:04,458 --> 00:22:06,458
So do I!

362
00:22:06,541 --> 00:22:08,416
Oh, I didn't know!

363
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:11,458
[moaning]

364
00:22:11,541 --> 00:22:14,166
[coughing, retching]

365
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:17,125
[rooster crowing]

366
00:22:17,958 --> 00:22:22,125
[GOKU laughing]

367
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:24,041
[GOKU] What a beautiful day!

368
00:22:24,125 --> 00:22:26,958
Come on, Master Roshi!
Let's train now!

369
00:22:28,083 --> 00:22:31,500
I... think we'll
take the day off...

370
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:35,916
[ROSHI groaning]

371
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,833
[NARRATOR] Martial Arts training
will continue on the island.

372
00:22:38,916 --> 00:22:42,375
Just as soon as Krillin and
Master Roshi can pick themselves

373
00:22:42,458 --> 00:22:46,416
up off the floor!
On the next Dragon Ball!
