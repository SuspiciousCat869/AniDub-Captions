00:02:11,375 --> 00:02:13,458
[NARRATOR]
Previously on Dragon Ball...

2
00:02:13,541 --> 00:02:17,541
Tambourine, brutal enforcer of
King Piccolo was sent to hunt

3
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:21,583
down and exterminate the members
of the Martial Arts Society.

4
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:27,916
[NARRATOR] One-by-one they fell.
No matter how confident...

5
00:02:30,791 --> 00:02:32,416
[NARRATOR] ...or strong.

6
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,833
[NEWS] Police are baffled as
to the motives of the killer

7
00:02:35,916 --> 00:02:38,541
and why only
martial artists are targeted.

8
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:40,125
[NARRATOR]
Alerted to the danger,

9
00:02:40,208 --> 00:02:44,708
Master Roshi and his team fled
Kame Island in search of safety.

10
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:49,083
[NARRATOR] King Piccolo
hatched a new warrior, Cymbal,

11
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:50,291
and sent him on a mission

12
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:53,000
to retrieve the
remaining six Dragon Balls.

13
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:55,208
Who do you serve my child?

14
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:56,583
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile, Goku,

15
00:02:56,666 --> 00:02:59,291
ravaged from his confrontation
with Tambourine,

16
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:00,666
stumbled through the jungle,

17
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:04,083
where he faced an even
greater adversary--hunger!

18
00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:06,666
I can't go on.
Gotta eat something.

19
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:11,000
[NARRATOR] Luckily,
Goku found some ammunition.

20
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:16,583
[NARRATOR] Things were
looking up for our young hero,

21
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:20,166
until he was suddenly
hit with another surprise.

22
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:22,166
[GOKU]
I know you're there!

23
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:24,666
Come out and face me you coward!

24
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:26,958
I'm not a coward.

25
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:29,291
You're the sneak
that stole my food!

26
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,208
[NARRATOR]
Expecting to find Tambourine,

27
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:33,833
Goku was surprised
by the new face.

28
00:03:33,916 --> 00:03:35,583
But is the stranger friendly,

29
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:38,500
or another adversary
for Goku to fight?

30
00:03:58,125 --> 00:03:59,750
[YAJIROBE] Hmm...

31
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:30,000
Ya thief!

32
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:31,708
Huh? What's that?

33
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:33,333
You heard!

34
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:37,041
I'm not a thief! I didn't
steal anything of yours!

35
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:38,458
Oh yeah?!

36
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:41,125
Well, I don't recall inviting
you to eat my brektis!

37
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:44,666
[GOKU] What's brektis?
It sounds awful.

38
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,541
My fish!

39
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:49,958
Look, I don't steal.

40
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:52,291
Can you prove
it's your brektis fish?

41
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:55,416
Hey, wait a minute.

42
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,000
Are you calling me a liar?!

43
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:59,666
If so, you'd better
be prepared to fight.

44
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,125
[GOKU] Okay.

45
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:07,500
I don't know where
you're from, big hair.

46
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:11,208
But around here, it's not polite
to steal other people's food!

47
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:12,750
Oh, I see.

48
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:14,625
But you're fine with throwing
giant boulders at strangers,

49
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:15,958
is that it?

50
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:20,125
My Dragon Ball! Now I get it.

51
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:23,250
You tried to hurt me because
you're helping that monster,

52
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:25,125
weren't you?

53
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:26,916
Monster?

54
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:29,041
You know who I'm talking about.

55
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:32,916
The monster. He's big and
green and he's got giant wings!

56
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
He took my
friend Krillin's life.

57
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:37,000
And so now I'm after his!

58
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:40,458
Hey, that's a nice story,
but my belly is still empty.

59
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:43,000
You stole food, now pay for it.

60
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:55,083
[YAJIROBE]
You're nothing but a thief!

61
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:57,000
Liar!

62
00:05:57,083 --> 00:06:00,166
I'd rather be a liar
than a thief! Thief!

63
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,708
So you admit that you're lying!

64
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:04,208
Why you!

65
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:08,791
[growls] Take that back!

66
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:10,208
Uh-uh!

67
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:23,458
[grunts]

68
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:50,958
You used your head.
That wasn't fair!

69
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:52,625
[chuckles]

70
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:54,666
I got you!

71
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:01,791
[YAJIROBE]
You hurt my nose!

72
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:04,083
Here, have a foot!

73
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:11,041
Hyaah!

74
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:19,125
My foot's stronger.

75
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,916
Oh well, have a nice nap.

76
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:34,750
Ready to give up?
If so, I'll help you out.

77
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:39,041
[gasps]

78
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:43,916
[gasps]

79
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:50,041
[GOKU thinking] I don't get it.
I kicked him as hard as I could.

80
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:52,208
Who is this guy?

81
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:55,166
[YAJIROBE thinking] I've never
been hit so hard in my life.

82
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:58,041
What's he made of, solid stone?!

83
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:01,541
[YAJIROBE thinking]
This isn't going to be

84
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:04,083
as easy as I thought.

85
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:06,541
[GOKU thinking] I still don't
know what brektis is.

86
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:24,291
[humming]

87
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:25,791
That one's all done.

88
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,583
Hardly worth the
effort, but finished.

89
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:38,958
Hmmm... Who's my next victim?

90
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:55,625
[ROSHI]
You kids don't worry.

91
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:57,916
You should be safe
here on this island.

92
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,708
But that doesn't mean you
don't stay on your guard.

93
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:02,625
[BULMA] Yeah, well,
that's really great advice

94
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,916
Master Roshi,
but we can't hide forever.

95
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,666
If we don't find the Dragon
Balls before King Piccolo,

96
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:10,041
none of us will be safe.

97
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:12,041
Hmmm...

98
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:14,000
You be careful, okay.

99
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:15,333
[CHIAOTZU]
We will.

100
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:16,416
[YAMCHA]
No, it isn't fair!

101
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,000
[CHIAOTZU]
Huh?

102
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:19,458
My darn leg.

103
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:22,666
If it wasn't all busted up,
I could go with you guys.

104
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,833
Don't worry. Just stay here
and get some rest.

105
00:09:24,916 --> 00:09:26,291
It's better this way.

106
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:30,500
If anything happens to us,
you'll be the only one left.

107
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:31,625
[gasps]

108
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:34,125
Promise me, please come back!

109
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:37,041
Mhmm.

110
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:40,000
[LAUNCH]
That's enough of that!

111
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,208
Don't talk like
you're not coming home!

112
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,791
If any of you get splattered,

113
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:47,291
I swear I'll fill you
with so many bullets,

114
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:51,333
you'll jump back to life
just to beg me for mercy!

115
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:54,625
Uh, right.

116
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:03,875
Huh?

117
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:29,583
Oh, I sure hope we
see those guys again.

118
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:32,708
Could you be any
more pessimistic?!

119
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:33,833
Show a little faith.

120
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:36,666
They're going to be just fine!

121
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,916
At least, I hope so.

122
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,958
Enough about that.

123
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,500
Come on. I'll make a freezing
capsule to preserve Krillin.

124
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:27,250
Eh heh heh heh heh.

125
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:28,583
We've spent a lot
of time together,

126
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:30,250
but we know so
little of each other.

127
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:32,208
So, I brought you
my family album.

128
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:34,458
Thought you might want
to look at some pictures.

129
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:38,583
[chuckles awkwardly]

130
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:40,416
Emperor please.

131
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,708
No one wants to see that.

132
00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:46,458
[PILAF] I've got double prints
if you see some you like.

133
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:48,833
Huh?

134
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:54,791
[SHU]
Uh, sire...

135
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:58,500
He doesn't share
your enthusiasm.

136
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:10,458
[PIANO] You silly worm.
His majesty is sleeping.

137
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:12,541
Huh?

138
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:17,125
He can rest with
both his eyes open,

139
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:19,500
especially when he's bored.

140
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,708
Whew...

141
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:57,416
Finished.

142
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:03,375
Ooh! What a beautiful chamber.

143
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:10,083
Thank you. Now let's
place Krillin inside, gently.

144
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:26,500
Hmph. He looks happy.
Probably loves the attention.

145
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:29,791
[chuckles]

146
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:32,125
He sure seems
comfortable in there.

147
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,625
Alright, that's it.
Time to close 'em up.

148
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:47,875
Whoa, tiny.

149
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:51,041
Don't mix 'em up
with your vitamins. Heh.

150
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:57,250
Hmmm... Where's a
good place to keep him?

151
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:06,208
[BULMA]
This should do the trick.

152
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:08,791
[OOLONG]
Right.

153
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:10,750
I'm sure Krillin loves being
stuffed next to your socks.

154
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:12,125
And your bloomers.

155
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:14,166
[BULMA]
I heard that!

156
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:16,125
Wait, just kidding!

157
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,916
I should be close.

158
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:29,291
[laughs]

159
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:41,000
All right, I can tell
you're not from around here.

160
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:43,375
What do ya call
yourself, big hair?

161
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:46,916
My name is Goku.
What do I call you?

162
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,666
I'm Yajirobe.

163
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:52,250
Yajirobe. That's funny.

164
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:55,375
Nyaaaah!

165
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:57,500
It beats Goku.

166
00:14:57,583 --> 00:14:59,416
[GOKU growls]
That does it!

167
00:15:03,791 --> 00:15:05,041
Huh?

168
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:10,333
Uh?

169
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:12,875
What's wrong with you?

170
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:14,291
Uh...

171
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:17,208
Hey, that Dragon Ball
you're wearing, it's not mine.

172
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:20,166
You have the one-star ball,
not the four!

173
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:21,416
I don't understand.

174
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,333
Where in the world
did you find yours?!

175
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:27,916
I found it in the jungle
somewhere about three years ago.

176
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,583
Wait, three years.
Then... Hmm...

177
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:33,458
Boy, do I feel silly.

178
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:35,958
This is all just
a misunderstanding.

179
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:40,083
There's no way you could
have helped that monster!

180
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:45,458
I told you I wasn't a liar.
But you did steal... my fish!

181
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:47,041
[giggles]

182
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:49,416
Do you have any
idea how long it takes

183
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,250
to cook a fish that size?

184
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:53,708
It takes hours!

185
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:56,500
[GOKU]
Look, that's him.

186
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:57,916
[YAJIROBE]
What an ugly bird.

187
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:05,333
You won't get away this time!

188
00:16:05,416 --> 00:16:08,166
[CYMBAL chuckles]

189
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:21,166
How long you live depends
on your answer to my question.

190
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:25,750
It looks like him, but that's
not the monster I fought.

191
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:27,125
[YAJIROBE]
All right, be quick.

192
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:29,500
What do you want from us?

193
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:34,041
I seek a little orange
ball with stars on it.

194
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:35,541
If either of you have seen one,

195
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:39,541
you'd better tell me or
suffer the consequences.

196
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:45,166
If you want someone's help,
you should learn to ask nicely.

197
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:46,625
Hmmm?

198
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:53,583
[laughs] I don't believe it!

199
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:55,875
Score!

200
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:59,458
Nice necklace.
Give it here!

201
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:03,333
Uh, if you're interested in the
Dragon Balls, that means that

202
00:17:03,416 --> 00:17:05,375
you must be partners
with the same monster

203
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:10,041
who destroyed my friend Krillin
and that makes you my enemy!

204
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:13,666
Huh? You'd better talk some
sense into you friend.

205
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:16,125
Choose your words
carefully, Monster.

206
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:18,583
He's not my friend.

207
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:23,041
Monster, do you have a
friend with a mouth like this?

208
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,708
And eyes like this?

209
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:26,916
And he's got big wings,
and he's mean and ugly,

210
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,375
but he's not as big as you?

211
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:31,083
[CYMBAL] Hmmm...

212
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:35,166
That sounds like, Tambourine.

213
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,708
Then he's the one I'm after.

214
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,875
I couldn't care less.

215
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:42,708
I'm here for the
Dragon Ball. Period!

216
00:17:42,791 --> 00:17:45,791
Sorry, I like it.

217
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:47,583
If you want one,
go find your own.

218
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:50,250
This one belongs to me.

219
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:52,083
So what?

220
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:54,250
I like yours just fine, boy.

221
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:56,125
Heh heh heh.

222
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:58,083
Since you're so cocky,

223
00:17:58,166 --> 00:18:02,833
I'd be happy to crush every
bone in your body to get it!

224
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:05,375
Hmph! Try it.
I'll break you in half.

225
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:08,750
No way. I'll take
care of this creature.

226
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:10,875
[YAJIROBE]
Stay back. He's mine.

227
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:14,791
I'm fighting him.
His ally killed my best friend.

228
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:17,500
I don't care.
Your problems don't concern me.

229
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:20,833
This green thing insulted me
and now he's going to pay.

230
00:18:20,916 --> 00:18:22,625
Why are you so stubborn?

231
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:25,375
He's my new brektis.

232
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:26,916
Huh?!

233
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,791
There's an easy way
to settle this.

234
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:31,666
Fine!

You can't be serious.

You're playing over
who will fight me?

--I choose scissors!
--I choose scissors!

Oh come on,

wrap around the rock, silly!

[CYMBAL growls]

Try and do your worst. I want
this fight to last a while.

Heh heh heh!

If you're so eager to die,
who am I to stand in your way?!

I'll be eating you soon!

Hah hah hah! You were saying?

254

It looks like the only thing
that you'll be eating is dirt!

[YAJIROBE]
Hmmm...

Huh?

257
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:57,250
It's been a strange day.
I keep meeting strong enemies.

258
00:19:57,333 --> 00:20:02,041
Ha! It's not the enemies'
strength. You're just weak.

[GOKU laughs]

260
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:08,666
There is no weakness
in me, monster!

Big words for small prey!

Hey, you don't look
as scary with less teeth.

263
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,916
You're just as ugly, though.

264
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:31,791
You'll pay for that!

265
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:36,625

how much you like dancing!

No one told me we
were using weapons!

271

Sure you don't want help?

Positive! I can handle
this beast by myself!

You're a good dancer.
Dance! Dance!

276
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:26,041
Be silent! And fight...

...with honor to the end!
