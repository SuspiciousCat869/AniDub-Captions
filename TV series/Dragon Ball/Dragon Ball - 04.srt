1
00:02:13,875 --> 00:02:16,208
[GOKU] Weeeee! Ho ho ho!

2
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:18,250
Woah, ha ha ha!

3
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,458
[BULMA] Hm?

4
00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:25,000
Waaah!

5
00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:27,416
[BULMA] Goku, wait for me!

6
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:32,000
[NARRATOR] Goku and Bulma have
already collected four of the

7
00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:33,875
seven magic Dragon Balls.

8
00:02:33,958 --> 00:02:36,458
Now, with only three
more to find before

9
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:38,916
they can make their wish,
our heroes race towards

10
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,375
the location of the fifth
Dragon Ball, which, according

11
00:02:41,458 --> 00:02:43,333
to Bulma's radar, isn't far off.

12
00:02:43,416 --> 00:02:45,166
[engine roaring]

13
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:47,666
[GOKU] Whoo, hooo! Ha ha ha!

14
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,875
Hey, Squirt! Pay
attention to where you're going!

15
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:51,750
You're not invincible, you know!

16
00:02:52,333 --> 00:03:00,291
[BULMA screaming]

17
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:02,750
[crash]

18
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:08,041
[GOKU] Wow! Are you okay, Bulma?

19
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:11,666
Ugh. Does it look
like I'm okay, you twerp?

20
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:14,083
[whimpering]

21
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:15,958
[GOKU] I guess not.

22
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,458
Bulma, look, the
Dragon Ball is glowing! 

23
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:25,000
You know what this
means, don't you?

24
00:03:25,083 --> 00:03:28,333
The fifth ball must be
really close. This is great!

25
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:31,041
Hey, look over there!
Do you see what I see?

26
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:32,958
[BULMA] A village!
Good eye, kid.

27
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:34,833
Do you think it's there?

28
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:36,875
Well, there's only
one way to find out.

29
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,208
[engine whirring]

30
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:52,000
[BULMA] I wonder
where everybody is.

31
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:53,875
[GOKU] Huh?

32
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:56,625
[BULMA] Let's see
what the radar says.

33
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:59,333
Yep, the fifth
Dragon Ball's here alright.

34
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:00,875
Something's weird.

35
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:02,000
[BULMA] It's too quiet.

36
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:03,916
Maybe this village
has been deserted.

37
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,708
[GOKU] No, people are
here. I can feel it.

38
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:08,000
[BULMA] Are you sure, Goku?

39
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:10,166
It seems like an
old ghost town to me.

40
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,250
Yeah, I'm positive.

41
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:14,208
[BULMA] If you say so.

42
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:17,000
[GOKU] Hello, in
there! Come on out!

43
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:19,875
[BULMA] Hello? Is
anybody home? Hello?

44
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:22,791
[GOKU] I think I just saw
someone peeking at us

45
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:25,041
from that window over there.

46
00:04:25,125 --> 00:04:26,916
[BULMA] This is getting freaky.

47
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:30,000
There must be some reason
why they won't come out here,

48
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:31,458
and I'm gonna find out!

49
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:40,041
[GOKU] Hello? I know
you're in there. Hello?

50
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:42,041
I hope they're not
in some sort of trouble.

51
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:49,208
[GOKU] Oh, yeah.
That did the trick.

52
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:51,250
Ever consider
using the handle?

53
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:54,125
[BULMA and GOKU] Hmm?

54
00:04:54,916 --> 00:04:56,708
[GOKU] Huh?

55
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:07,250
Aah, oww!
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

56
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:08,458
[screams]

57
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:11,916
Ahh. Oh, no.
It's just as I feared...

58
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,750
Oh, I should have known...

59
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:15,333
[GIRL] Huh?

60
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:18,416
[GOKU] What'd you do that for?!
That didn't tickle, you know!

61
00:05:19,458 --> 00:05:21,333
Oh, please forgive
me, Mister Oolong!

62
00:05:21,416 --> 00:05:23,583
I know it was foolish of
me to try and attack you,

63
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:26,291
but I'd rather die
than lose my daughter!

64
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:27,958
Oh, please don't take
her! I'll do anything!

65
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:29,291
--[GOKU] Huh?
--[BULMA] Oolong?

66
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:31,250
Hey, I think you've got
me mixed up with someone.

67
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:32,208
[GOKU] My name's Goku.

68
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:34,083
[GIRL] It's not him, Dad.

69
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:41,750
[crowd murmuring]

70
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:44,708
[GIRL] Here we
go, this'll help.

71
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:46,041
[GOKU] Careful! Ow!

72
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:47,291
What a thick head!

73
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:48,500
Yeah, ha ha!

74
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:50,875
He could've been killed!
Shame on you! Hmph!

75
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:52,250
I thought he was Oolong!

76
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:54,708
[MAN] I was only trying
to protect my daughter.

77
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:56,708
[GOKU] Daughter? Does that
mean that you're a girl?

78
00:05:56,791 --> 00:05:58,291
[giggles]

79
00:05:58,375 --> 00:06:00,000
[screaming]

80
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:03,250
Yep! Thought so!
You're a girl alright.

81
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:05,250
[GOKU laughing]

82
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:07,916
What'd you do that for?!

83
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,375
Guess, Einstein!

84
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:10,375
[GOKU] Hm?

85
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:11,875
So what does this
Oolong fellow do

86
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:14,458
that makes everybody
so afraid of him?

87
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,916
[GIRL crying]

88
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,666
He's our worst nightmare.

89
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:21,166
He's a blackness that has
descended on our village.

90
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,916
A monster who treats
us like his toys.

91
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,041
That bad?

92
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:26,208
[MAN] Much worse.

93
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:27,583
How so?

94
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:29,916
Well, somehow this terrible
creature has the power

95
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,041
to change into any
shape it wants to.

96
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:34,625
[growling]

97
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:38,041
[screaming]

98
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:39,916
[GOBLIN chuckles]

99
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:44,333
Instead of one nightmare,
we're cursed by many.

100
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:46,916
No one knows his real
identity, we just know

101
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,500
[MAN] he wants our daughters.

102
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:51,666
That monster's kidnapped three
girls from the village already.

103
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:52,916
[BULMA] Huh?

104
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,500
[MAN] And yesterday my
darkest fears came true.

105
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:58,583
He wants my daughter, Pocowatha.

106
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:00,666
Today's your lucky day,
Sherman Priest!

107
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,416
I've decided to
honor your house by taking

108
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,666
your daughter's hand
in marriage tomorrow!

109
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,750
[POCOWATHA crying]

110
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:08,125
[GOBLIN] Pack your
bag, Pocowatha!

111
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:10,041
And don't worry
about the dowry, Dad!

112
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:13,541
[GOBLIN laughing]

113
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:14,750
Bully! Maybe we can

114
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:16,708
trap him when
he comes back again.

115
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:19,250
How will you do that?
He's bigger than this house!

116
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:21,416
My word. You don't
get it, do you?

117
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,625
Oolong would squish
you like a little bug!

118
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:25,791
There's no way to
stop this monster!

119
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:27,291
[whimpering]

120
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:29,458
[SHERMAN] So tell us: why have
you two come here anyway?

121
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:30,458
I'll show you.

122
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:31,916
[SHERMAN] Hmm?

123
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:36,125
[BULMA] Let's see...
there it is!

124
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:39,041
We came to find a ball
that matches this one.

125
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:43,583
Hm. Strange.
Yes, it's very beautiful.

126
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:45,208
But I've never seen
anything like it.

127
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:48,041
--[OLD WOMAN] Well, I have.
--[SHERMAN] Huh?

128
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:50,416
Young lady, I have
the matching one.

129
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,125
I knew there was one here!

130
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:53,916
What do you know?
How 'bout that.

131
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,500
[BULMA] Can I see it, please?

132
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:57,791
[OLD WOMAN] Mm-hmm.

133
00:07:57,875 --> 00:07:59,333
Here it is.

134
00:07:59,416 --> 00:08:01,666
Yeah! The six-star ball!

135
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:02,666
[GOKU] Wow.

136
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,416
--Cool!
--Would you give it to us?

137
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,208
I'm not going to
give this ball away.

138
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:09,083
It's been in my
family for generations.

139
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:12,625
[BULMA] Would you give us
your Dragon Ball if we could

140
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:15,250
get rid of that Oolong creep,
get the girls back,

141
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:17,916
and return your village
to a peaceful place again?

142
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,375
[SHERMAN] A-Ah, by yourselves?

143
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:24,708
Now, listen, I may be old
but I'm not gullible.

144
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:27,583
How could the two
of you defeat Oolong?

145
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:30,000
Well, Goku and I
are quite a team, ma'am.

146
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:31,041
Right? Huh?

147
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:33,041
[crowd murmuring]

148
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:34,625
[BULMA yells]

149
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:37,041
So you're a girl,
aren't you?

150
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:39,333
Huh?! What a randy boy!

151
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:43,083
Are you crazy?!
Please stop doing that!

152
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:44,666
[BULMA] Ugh!

153
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:47,041
[MAN] Do you think that you and
that boy really have a chance

154
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:48,916
to beat Oolong, Miss?

155
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:51,208
[BULMA] Yeah, I think we
have a good chance.

156
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:53,458
Goku's a little on the puny
side, but he packs a wallop.

157
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:54,750
Don'tcha kid?

158
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:56,083
[GOKU] Hmm.

159
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:58,666
[BULMA] I'm Bulma. I'm

160
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,250
Would you forgive me
for hitting you?

161
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:01,458
We'd appreciate your help.

162
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:02,541
[GOKU] Sure.

163
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,166
There's a legend
that speaks of a boy who

164
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:05,750
would come to
liberate our people,

165
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:08,250
but we always thought
it was just folklore.

166
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:09,500
[OLD WOMAN] Mm-hmm.

167
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:11,791
Bulma, it would be the
answer to all my prayers

168
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:14,041
if you brought my baby back!

169
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:16,541
[MAN 2] You have my
blessing young warrior.

170
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:19,375
Your courage stands like a
great monument before my people.

171
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:20,666
[giggles]

172
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,708
I just thought of a
great way to trap Oolong.

173
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:25,958
[BULMA] All right!
You look great, kid!

174
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:28,791
You'd be totally charming
if you smiled a bit more.

175
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:30,750
There's not much
to smile about.

176
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:32,791
Can we come up with
a different plan, Bulma?

177
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:34,875
Sorry, no time, kid!

178
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:37,500
Gosh, Goku.
You make a real pretty girl.

179
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:40,083
[BULMA] Now remember Goku,
don't blow your cover.

180
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:42,125
He has to think
you're Pocowatha.

181
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:43,500
The important thing is
to find out where

182
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:46,041
he's keeping the girls.
After that you can handle it

183
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:47,541
any way you want to.

184
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:49,375
All right, all right.
I'll do it.

185
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:51,541
But I'm not going to
like this one little bit!

186
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:53,208
[distant crash]

187
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:54,250
Huh?

188
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:55,958
[SHERMAN] It's Oolong!
He's coming!

189
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:57,708
[BULMA screaming]

[VILLAGERS screaming]

00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:13,666
[MAN] He's coming!

193
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:16,333
Oolong's in the village
and he's on his way here!

194
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:18,541
[BULMA] Good job! Now try
to make sure everyone

195
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:19,958
gets into their
houses safely!

196
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:21,000
[MAN] I'll do it!

197
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:24,041
Okay, it's up to you.
Good luck.

198
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:26,375
Well, since you're
the brains of this outfit,

199
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:28,250
you're going to help me, right?

200
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,416
[BULMA] I'll be right here
rooting for you, Goku.

201
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,708
[GOKU] Mmm.

202
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:36,625
[BULMA] Alright, kid,
it's showtime.

203
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:38,458
Don't let him get a
good look at your face.

204
00:10:38,541 --> 00:10:40,416
And remember: smile.

205
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,291
[GOKU] Next time, I'm
making the plan.

206
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:48,291
[OOLONG] I've come for
you, my little buttercup!

207
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:50,375
I brought you some flowers.

208
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:52,916
I hope you
like them, sweetheart.

209
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,291
[GOKU] Oh, y-yeah, uh,
I love flowers.

210
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:59,208
[OOLONG] Huh? Packed
your rolling pin?

211
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:00,583
[whimpering]

212
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:02,666
[OOLONG] And I see you've
put on a little weight!

213
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:05,333
[GOKU] Yeah, well, uh,
l-look who's talking.

214
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:06,583
You scamp!

215
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:09,208
[OOLONG] A little feisty
today, aren't we?

216
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:11,250
Goku! Where did you
learn how to act?!

217
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:12,375
If you don't shape up,
you're gonna

218
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:14,250
blow this thing big-time!

219
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:15,791
Mmm.

220
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:18,041
That's good,
I like 'em fiesty.

221
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:19,625
I wouldn't change
anything on you,

222
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:22,458
except maybe that ugly scarf.

223
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:24,416
[GOKU] Hm? Uh-oh...

224
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,833
Oh my. You're trembling.

225
00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:29,625
[GOKU] That's because I need
to use the bathroom real bad.

226

You're scared!

Well, I get my feelings hurt
when girls are scared of me.

00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:57,375
[GOKU] Huh?

232
00:11:57,458 --> 00:11:58,666
What do you think of this?

233
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:01,083
Suave, debonair, handsome.
If you don't like it

234
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:03,625
I can always change
into something else.

235
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:05,125
[GOKU chuckles]

236
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:06,541

--[OOLONG] Hmm?
--[GOKU] Huh?

Well, hello there, stranger!
My name's Bulma.

239
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:16,333
I don't think we've met.

My. Can such beauty be real?

You must be a dream.

Nope, I'm all... woman.

244
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:27,833
[OOLONG] Imagine, if I had
a woman like that...

245
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:30,875
Oohhh...

246
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:34,833
Yes. She's a delicious
catch if I ever saw one.

247
00:12:34,916 --> 00:12:37,625
Oh, but what about Pocowatha?

248
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:38,916
So, uh, when are
you gonna kidnap me

249
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,583
and take me away?

250
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:42,625
[OOLONG] Ooh, I can't
just leave Pocowatha,

251
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:45,083
but I'd be crazy to
refuse a girl like that.

252
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,708
Pocowatha or the new girl?
Pocowatha or the new girl?

Pocowatha or the--huh?

00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:55,250
Where'd she go?

255

[OOLONG] What?! Am I seeing
what I think I'm seeing?!

256
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:07,041
This must be some
mistake! It can't be!

257
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:09,125
Hmm? Uurgh!

00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:19,875
I've been deceived!
You're not Pocowatha!

260
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:22,791
Huh? What gave me away?
It was my tail, wasn't it?

261
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:25,958
If there is one thing
I cannot tolerate,

262
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:29,166
it is deception!

I'm am not a cow,
I am a bull!

Can't you tell the difference?!

handsome, debonair man

with the really
expensive trench coat?

Excuse me.

This is just too weird!

275
00:13:57,666 --> 00:14:00,166
That monstrous beast
has deceived you, too.

276
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,291
He fools you by changing
into the one thing

277
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:04,791
that you want most. And in
your case, that's a man.

278
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:07,083
You should be
ashamed of yourself!

279
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:08,416
Uh...

280
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,500
The good thing is I don't
think he wants to marry

281
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:13,708
Pocowatha any more, he
wants to marry you instead.

282
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:15,791
You'll make a
nice bride, Bulma.

283
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:17,833
What kind of a girl
do you think I am?!

284
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:19,458
I'm not getting
married to a bull!

285
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:21,000
And that's that!

Now we'll see just
how tough you really are.

292
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,750
Don't forget to find out
where the girls are!

293
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:39,416
And stay alive, okay?!

294

Say your prayers, chico,
your time has come!

You've reached the end of
the road there, muchacho!

Eh. Smile. Pfft.

[OOLONG yells]

300
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,291
What are you, loco, kid?!

301
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:55,250
There's still a way
you can save yourself!

302
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:56,291
Get the señorita!

303
00:14:58,916 --> 00:15:01,166
Forget it, bully!
Come on, let's go!

304
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:02,666
[OOLONG] Alright, then!
So be it!

305
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:06,458
A little monkey-boy burrito
might hit the spot anyway!

306
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:07,833
Sounds yummy!

307
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:09,916
Look, you can't scare me
like you've scared

308

everyone else.
I'm not buying it!

309
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:12,875
[OOLONG] Haven't you noticed?!

310
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:15,666
You're a little
cucaracha with a stick,

311
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:18,291
and I am a gigantic bull!

give those girls back now!

00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:32,833
[GOKU] Hey! Come back
here and fight!

318
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:34,291
Where are you going?!

319
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:39,250
[GOKU] Hey, come back!

320
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:49,458
[GOKU] Huh?

321
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:52,708
[whistling]

322
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:54,125
Hey, excuse me.

323
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:56,333
A giant bull just came
barreling through here.

324
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:58,166
Did you see where it went?

325
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,416
There.

326
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,500
[GOKU] Ha-ha!

327
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:05,500
Hi. This is the bonafide one
hundred percent original me.

328
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:07,750
Believe it or not,
a good-looking guy like myself

329
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:09,458
has trouble scoring chicks.

330
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:11,250
That's why I transform.

331
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:16,125
[OOLONG] The art of
transformation is a very

332
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:18,916
powerful technique and should
only be used responsibly

333
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,750
to solve serious problems.

334
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:23,875
In my case, I was being
dogged by girls left and right,

335
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:26,625
despite my natural cute
and cuddly appearance.

336
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:28,375
But now that I've gone to
shape-shifting school,

337
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:29,958
all that's changed.

338
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:32,666
But the problem is I can only
hold a shape for five minutes,

339
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:33,875
and then, poof!

340
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:35,583
That's why I had to
run away from that kid.

341
00:16:35,666 --> 00:16:36,916
[SHERMAN]
You say Oolong ran away?

342
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,083
[BULMA]
Yeah, I saw him take off,

343
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:40,208
and Goku went after him.

344
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:42,541
[SHERMAN] Hmm. Remarkable.

345
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:44,958
What an extraordinary boy.

346
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:46,708
Yeah. Goku will
chase him a hundred miles

347
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:48,125
if he has to.

348
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:51,125
Wow. Maybe it's
the legend after all.

349
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:52,625
Hey, yo, Oolong.

350
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:55,375
I know you're out there,
you can't hide forever.

351
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:56,583
Couldn't find him, huh?

352
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:58,333
[GOKU] Uh-uh.

354
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:03,375
[GOKU] Hey, everybody,
he ran away!

355
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:06,833
He might just be hiding
though, so look out!

356
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:08,583
[OOLONG] All right,
here we go again.

357
00:17:08,666 --> 00:17:11,041
But I'd better watch it, or this
kid could ruin a good thing.

358
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:13,000
If I wanna keep these
simpletons in line,

359
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:16,791
I'd better come up with
something really fierce.

360
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:19,666
Wait, I know
a good one... Yeah.

361
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:24,333
[GOKU] Hmm. I guess he is gone.

Looking for me, kid?

[laughs]

366
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:34,500
Did you really think
I would run away?!

367
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:36,208
[GOKU stammers]

368
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:40,125
[OOLONG] You seem a
little timid this time.

369
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:43,458
Well you're lucky, tiny tot,
because I'm feeling generous.

370
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:45,666
I was going to dunk you
in this hot soup

371
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,416
and eat you like a dumpling,

372
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,666
but if you leave town now,
I will spare you.

373
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:53,416
I think I'll stay.
So go ahead and eat me...

00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:57,083

you made me do!

[GOKU] What are you
talking about?

I didn't make you do anything!

[OOLONG]
Alright, that does it!

Your luck's run out,
little runt!

382
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:09,041
I was going to
let you go because

383

you're not like all
the other cowards,

choice but to destroy--

wanna get yourself killed?!

Ah! You know you've
got a real little monster

on your hands there, lady!

you were going to destroy me.

from my Grandpa.

on the clouds.

00:22:08,458 --> 00:22:10,708
[MAN 2] Alexi!
What are you doing?!

476
00:22:10,791 --> 00:22:14,625
Oh, hi, Daddy.
What's happening?

477
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:17,250
Sorry, I didn't write, Mommy.
I've been super busy.

478
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:20,291
Me, too. Man, time has
just been flying by.

479
00:22:20,375 --> 00:22:21,750
[BULMA] Did you find them?

480
00:22:21,833 --> 00:22:23,208
--[GOKU] Huh?
--[OOLONG] Hi, girls.

481
00:22:23,291 --> 00:22:25,375
[ALEXI] Oh, hi snookums!
Oh, before I forget,

482
00:22:25,458 --> 00:22:28,083
I'm totally out of pink
lipstick and red nail polish.

483
00:22:28,166 --> 00:22:29,750
[SARAH] And I need
a new hair-dryer.

484
00:22:29,833 --> 00:22:32,166
[LITTLE FLOWER] Did you bring
the diet drinks I asked you for?

485
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:33,750
I was hoping
these girls would cook

486
00:22:33,833 --> 00:22:35,416
and take care of my house,
but they won't.

487
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,291
All they wanna do
is lay around.

488
00:22:37,375 --> 00:22:39,375
Take them off my hands.
Pretty please?

489
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:42,416
[gasping]

490
00:22:43,333 --> 00:22:45,458
Well, this belongs
to you and Goku now.

491
00:22:45,541 --> 00:22:47,500
Wow, you made our day!

492
00:22:49,458 --> 00:22:52,500
[BULMA] Just two more to go and
then I can call the Dragon

493
00:22:52,583 --> 00:22:54,375
to make my wish!
