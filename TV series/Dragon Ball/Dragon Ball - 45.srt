00:02:12,916 --> 00:02:14,791
[NARRATOR]
Previously on Dragon Ball,

2
00:02:14,875 --> 00:02:17,333
Goku needed to have the
Dragon Radar repaired,

3
00:02:17,416 --> 00:02:20,250
so it was off to the
big city to find Bulma!

4
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:23,958
[GOKU] Whoaaa...

5
00:02:24,041 --> 00:02:26,583
[NARRATOR] And thanks to one
of West City's men in blue,

6
00:02:26,666 --> 00:02:29,833
Goku made his way to her home
at Capsule Corporation.

7
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:33,958
[NARRATOR] It was a
time for happy hellos

8
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:38,041
as Goku was reunited with Bulma
and his dear, old friends!

9
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:39,625
--[OOLONG] Hey, kid!
--[PUAR] Yaye!

10
00:02:39,708 --> 00:02:42,375
[NARRATOR] But look out, Yamcha!
Not everyone's happy to see you!

11
00:02:42,458 --> 00:02:45,958
The teeny-weeny Bulma resumed
full form to let Yamcha know

12
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:49,291
that he was fully
in the doghouse.

13
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:52,666
His popularity with the ladies
had Yamcha walking on air.

14
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,750
But Bulma was not amused!

15
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:56,166
And she was there to remind him,

16
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:59,041
that what goes up
must come down.

17
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:01,458
[YAMCHA whimpers]

18
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:04,333
[NARRATOR] While Yamcha was
pondering the error of his ways,

19
00:03:04,416 --> 00:03:07,708
Bulma was reducing her
boil to a steady simmer.

20
00:03:07,791 --> 00:03:10,041
Yes... It was love.

21
00:03:12,541 --> 00:03:14,958
[NARRATOR] Little did they know
that lurking in the shadows

22
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:17,958
was a much more serious
threat to their peace of mind.

23
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:21,416
Hasky, of the Red Ribbon Army,
and her devious accomplices

24
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,875
had Goku's two Dragon Balls
in their sights.

25
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:29,791
[HASKY] They tell me
you're pretty powerful, kid.

26
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:31,750
But you're still just a child!

27
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:34,833
Those Dragon Balls
are as good as mine!

28
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:37,583
Wait and see...

29
00:03:37,666 --> 00:03:40,791
[NARRATOR] And so they
went--unaware of Hasky's designs

30
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:45,750
on Goku's Dragon Balls--to the
great amusement park in the sky.

31
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:07,791
[GOKU] Hey, the stairs
are moving, you guys!

32
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:10,166
[GOKU laughs]

33
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,583
Wow! Look at all
those buildings!

34
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:14,000
This is great!

35
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:15,125
Wee!

36
00:04:15,208 --> 00:04:16,250
Yay!

37
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:17,041
Whoa!

38
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:18,375
[GOKU giggles]

39
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,333
[OOLONG grunts,
PUAR screams]

40
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:21,666
--[OOLONG] Watch it, buddy!
--[GOKU laughs]

41
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,958
I'm made out of pork, not rock!

42
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:26,416
[PUAR] I think I
bruised my bunyun...

43
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,875
Ohh...

44
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:49,958
[ALL gasping]

45
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:51,791
[BULMA] Pretty cool, huh?

46

[ALL gasping]

47
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,416
[GOKU] I could ride
this ride all day!

48
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,250
[BULMA] This is just the
entrance, silly!

49
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:03,416
[gasping &amp; laughing]

50
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,416
[YAMCHA] There's
the end! Hold on!

51
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,541
[ALL yell]

52
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:14,333
[GOKU] Wow! Look at that lady!

53
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:15,500
She's beautiful!

54
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:17,833
[BULMA] That's a statue, Goku.

55
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:20,166
[GOKU] Yeah, I knew that...

56
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:21,875

60
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:28,583
Uhh...

61
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:30,333
They were here before.

Hey, there! Tickets!

66
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:38,458
I'm not "Tickets"!

Doggone, Hasky!

You could steal the
paint job off of a car!

I swear!

88

You won't have any problem
getting those balls!

Will you, Hasky?

Ha, ha. No.

What's wrong, Goku?

Well, I feel like
someone's watching me.

[OOLONG] Are you kidding?!

No. I guess there are a lot
of people in here, huh?

Well, no biggie!

easier than I thought!

you, then they'll come back.

[YAMCHA] Wow... Heh, heh. Heh...

00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,041
Blugh!

169
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:09,125
[HASKY] Huh?!

170
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:12,166
Hold it! Don't move!

171
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:17,791
Hey! She's got a booger
on her forehead!

[HASKY sighs]

He's cracked!

174
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:24,000
That's a mole, Goku! Gosh!

175
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:25,500
Say you're sorry!

176
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:28,166
Sorry, mole...?

[RIDERS laughing]

178
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:41,041
So he thinks he can run off just
because I'm mad at him, does he?

179
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:42,500
[BULMA growls]

180
00:10:52,041 --> 00:10:55,375
Wow! You really can
tell a person's fortune?

181
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:57,750
Yes, so could my
great grandmother.

182
00:10:57,833 --> 00:11:00,500
I guess I got the
talent from her.

183
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:03,166
You mean, you
see the future?

184
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:04,833
The past as well.

185
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:07,291
Yes. Everything...

186
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:08,833
Wow!

187
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:11,416
You see stuff about me?

188
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,291
Well, yes.

189
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:16,416
[YAMCHA] Why don't you let
her tell your fortune, Goku?

190
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,708
[GOKU] Okay!

191
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:21,000
[HASKY] Hmm....

192
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:25,791
Please. Let go of all
thoughts. All worries.

[GOKU] Hmm...?

194
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:33,458
[HASKY] You've been
to the north lately...

195
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:36,041
To a very cold place...

196
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:39,666
On an expedition;
a mission of some kind...

197
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:45,333
[HASKY] Oh, my!
You were in great danger!

198
00:11:45,416 --> 00:11:50,500
I also see a tower...
A very large tower...

199
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:52,041
Muscle Tower!

200

You're right! That's incredible!

201
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:56,708
[OOLONG] You mean,
it's all true?

202
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:58,041

Do you see anything else?

Of course...

206
00:12:03,416 --> 00:12:05,458
Just a moment...

207
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:10,166
You have something...
concealed...

208
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:12,166
Con-what?

209
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:14,041
Hidden...

210

Oh, yes!

211
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,375
I see!

212
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:18,250
You have two balls!

213
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:20,833
They're very important and
they're hidden in your clothes!

214
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:22,125
Huh?

215
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:25,500
Oh, wow! She's
right again, guys!

May I see them, please?

218
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:31,625
I believe that they hold
the key to your future.

219
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:36,291
Well, I guess so. Why not?

220
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:38,541
[HASKY] Yes! Perfect!

221
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:40,208
As soon as the lights go out,

222
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:43,458
I'll switch the real balls
with the fake ones.

[HASKY] Get ready, Hasky.

You knew all about me!

231
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,708
Not all about you,
just the private parts!

he's an idiot or a genius.

Goku, I was just
thinking! The two balls?

235
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:36,750
Maybe she meant
the Dragon Balls!

236
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:38,208
[GOKU] Oh, yeah!

237
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:45,166

about the Dragon Balls.

00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:12,708
[HASKY giggles]

330
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:14,166
[BOTH grunt]

331
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:17,083
[GOKU] Hey! These two wanted
to say that they're sorry!

332
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:20,041
[YAMCHA] Goku! That woman
took the Dragon Balls!

333
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:22,458
Look! She's a bad girl, Goku!

334
00:18:22,541 --> 00:18:25,000
You've got to break the
box hanging on her hip

335
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:27,458
or else the whole park's
going to blow up!

336
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:28,625
[ALL gasp]

337
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:31,666
Get the box, Goku!
Smash the box!

338
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:36,500
[GOKU growls]

339
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:41,750
Come to me, Flying Nimbus!

340
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,875
[GOKU] Haaaaa!

341
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:57,041
[GOKU] Pull over, lady!

342
00:18:57,125 --> 00:18:58,500
What? Shoot!

343
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:01,625
[HASKY] Ciao!

344
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:29,333
[GIRL hums]

345
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:30,791
[GIRL screams]

346
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:35,458
[HASKY gasps]

347
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:44,625
[GOKU] You're in big trouble!

348
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:45,750
Who me?

349
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:46,958
You're friends are
the ones in trouble!

350
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:49,333
They're going to blow up
in ten seconds!

351
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:50,375
But why?

352
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:52,291
That's the way
the ball bounces!

353
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:53,458
[HASKY laughs]

354
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:55,583
[GOKU] Ball? What ball?

355
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:57,458
Hey! Look out!

356
00:19:57,541 --> 00:19:59,666
[HASKY screams]

357
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:06,250
[HASKY grunts]

358
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:39,458
[GOKU] I think you'd
better hand those over.

359
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:42,041
Forget it, kid. Buzz off!

360
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:44,291
Well, okay.

361
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:45,708
[GOKU giggles]

362
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:48,208
[GOKU] If that's
the way you want it!

363
00:20:48,291 --> 00:20:50,833
[HASKY laughs]

364
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,625
[GOKU] Goochy-goo! Ha, ha,
goochy-goochy-goo-goo!

365
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:54,708
[HASKY] Stop it!

366
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:56,166
--[HASKY laughs]
--[GOKU] Tickle, tickle!

367
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:04,083
[OOLONG] I almost died
and I didn't even know!

368
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:05,500
[PUAR] Thank goodness!

369
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:08,875
You're rotten company when
you're terrified, Oolong!

370
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:13,666
Guys, I think I should go
back and look for Bulma.

371
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:16,500
What do you mean? C'mon,
we looked all over the place!

372
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:18,541
She's not there!

373
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:21,250
See! There she is!
She's home already!

374
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:24,500
Bulma!

375
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:25,916
Uhh... Hmm?

376
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,125
[OOLONG] Uh-oh... I'm no
expert on chicks, but I'd run!

377
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:30,583
[PUAR] Oolong, hush!

378
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:35,791
[YAMCHA] I'm...
glad you're okay.

379
00:21:35,875 --> 00:21:37,750
I was worried about you.

380
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:39,958
[BULMA growls]

381
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:41,958
[YAMCHA grunts]

382
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:43,416
[ALL gasp]

383
00:21:46,083 --> 00:21:48,083
[BULMA ] I've had it
with you, Yamcha!

384
00:21:48,166 --> 00:21:50,833
I'm going to collect the
Dragon Balls and ask the Dragon

385
00:21:50,916 --> 00:21:52,916
for a man who
doesn't lie and cheat

386
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,291
and who doesn't have a fan club!

387
00:21:55,375 --> 00:21:57,166
Let's go, Goku!

388
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:59,083
[GOKU] Uhh...

389
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:00,541
[BULMA] Goku! Come on!

390
00:22:03,458 --> 00:22:05,791
[GOKU] I guess I'll
see you later, guys.

391
00:22:07,916 --> 00:22:09,250
[YAMCHA] Goku!

392
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:10,208
Thanks...

393
00:22:10,291 --> 00:22:11,666
Sure! You bet!

394
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,250
All right! Forward ho!

395
00:22:22,333 --> 00:22:25,791
It's you and me, kid!
Just like old times!

396
00:22:29,666 --> 00:22:32,333
[GOKU laughs] Yeah!

397
00:22:32,416 --> 00:22:35,000
[NARRATOR] As Goku and Bulma
ride off into the sunset,

398
00:22:35,083 --> 00:22:37,708
the promise of a new
adventure lies ahead.

399
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:41,458
[NARRATOR] But not every
cloud has a silver lining.

400
00:22:41,541 --> 00:22:44,375
And though the two friends
are off to a tranquil start,

401
00:22:44,458 --> 00:22:47,500
little do they know that
rough seas lie ahead.

402
00:22:47,583 --> 00:22:50,541
Join us next time
on Dragon Ball!
