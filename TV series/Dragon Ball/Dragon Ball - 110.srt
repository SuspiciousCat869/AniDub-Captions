00:02:11,875 --> 00:02:14,750
[NARRATOR]
Previously on Dragon Ball...

2
00:02:14,833 --> 00:02:18,250
Master Roshi stumbled upon
the six-star Dragon Ball

3
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:22,375
as he continued his search along
with Tien Shinhan and Chiaotzu.

4
00:02:22,458 --> 00:02:25,125
[ROSHI] Hey, it's the
six-star ball! We did it!

5
00:02:25,208 --> 00:02:27,458
[NARRATOR]
King Piccolo tracked down Goku

6
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:29,125
and challenged him to battle

7
00:02:29,208 --> 00:02:33,875
for the demise of his henchmen,
Cymbal and Tambourine.

8
00:02:33,958 --> 00:02:35,833
You are the reason
I have exterminated

9
00:02:35,916 --> 00:02:39,041
the Martial Arts Society.

10
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:41,000
You deserve to be terminated.

11
00:02:41,083 --> 00:02:42,625
[NARRATOR]
Goku fought bravely,

12
00:02:42,708 --> 00:02:44,875
but against
King Piccolo's might,

13
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:48,875
it wasn't enough.

14
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:52,916
As a last defense, Goku
used the Kamehameha Wave,

15
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:00,375
his most powerful technique.

16
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:13,791
[GOKU] ...Ha!

17
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:15,208
[NARRATOR] It didn't work.

18
00:03:15,291 --> 00:03:25,250
It's about time
we said goodbye... Boy!

19
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:35,291
It's about time
we said goodbye... Boy!

20
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:45,291
It's about time
we said goodbye... Boy!

21
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:55,291
It's about time
we said goodbye... Boy!

22
00:03:55,375 --> 00:04:07,208
It's about time
we said goodbye... Boy!

23
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:08,250
Rain.

24
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:20,208
[GOKU groaning]

25
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:31,875
[chuckling menacingly]

26
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,958
[GOKU yells]

27
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:47,583
For once, I'm glad I'm hiding.

28
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:49,708
[chuckling]

29
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:53,416
You... won't... win.

30
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:04,791
He has to have...
some... weakness.

31
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:08,083
I believe we've come to the part
where you're supposed to grovel

32
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:10,625
and beg for your pathetic life.

33
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:14,500
[groaning]

34
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:20,958
I'll never give in to you...
Never!

35
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:22,333
[chuckling]

36
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:25,208
All right... die!

37
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:28,083
Now is when it really gets good!

38
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,458
Uh oh!

39
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:44,416
Come on!

40
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,833
Let's see if you
can live through this!

41
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:49,875
Do it!

42
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:10,833
[yelling]

43
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:16,416
[yelling continues]

44
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:35,458
Goku's gonna get creamed!

45
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:50,583
[GOKU yelling]

46
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:54,083
[screaming]

47
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:43,583
So this is the best that
the human race has to offer?

48
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:52,291
The boy's heart is cold...
It is over.

49
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:57,750
[laughing]

50
00:07:57,833 --> 00:07:59,791
[laughing continues]

51
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:13,500
It's so nice to see him
in good spirits again.

52
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:18,000
Oh wow! He's truly amazing!

53
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:19,708
You can say that again!

54
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:31,291
Good show, Your Majesty!

55
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:33,291
Vengeance is most refreshing.

56
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:38,041
It's what keeps up my youthful
appearance. Our friends await.

57
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:39,916
Yes.

58
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,791
I think we've
given them enough time

59
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:44,375
to collect the rest
of our Dragon Balls.

60
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:49,041
[PICCOLO laughs]

61
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:52,333
[PILAF]
Excuse me...

62
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:55,375
[PILAF laughing nervously]

63
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:58,791
Once rejuvenated,
will he be stronger?

64
00:08:58,875 --> 00:09:03,250
Yes. What you've just witnessed
will seem weak by comparison.

65
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:14,000
[YAJIROBE] I thought
he'd never leave...

66
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:16,666
I didn't think
anyone could kill Goku.

67
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:20,125
I guess there's always
someone more powerful somewhere.

68
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:24,000
I'm sorry things had
to end this way, Goku.

69
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:25,666
I'm sorry
I couldn't help you.

70
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:28,208
But you will receive
a hero's burial.

71
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:37,416
Is it possible?!

72
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:43,000
[heart beating]

73
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,708
Wait! I--I think
I hear something!

74
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:50,583
Come on, come on! Goku! Wake up!

75
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:56,291
[coughing]

76
00:09:57,416 --> 00:09:59,125
Need... water.

77
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:00,375
Hang on!

78
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:20,208
That's it. Take your time.

79
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:26,458
I still can't believe it!

80
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:29,208
I mean, that fight was brutal!
I can't believe you're alive!

81
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:32,791
I didn't think anyone could
survive against King Piccolo!

82
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:40,416
I was no match for him... He--He
defeated me like I was nothing!

83
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,541
Don't be so hard
on yourself, Goku.

84
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:44,166
No one else could
have done any better.

85
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,458
King Piccolo isn't
your everyday fighter.

86
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:52,541
Yajirobe, have you ever
heard of Korin Tower?

87
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:55,708
Korin Tower? Never heard of it.

88
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:57,625
I trained there once before.

89
00:10:57,708 --> 00:10:59,750
Listen, I have to
ask you a big favor.

90
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:02,125
Do you think you
could take me to it?

91
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:06,125
My muscles seem kinda stuck, but
I think I know who can help me.

92
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:09,500
Sounds like a strange
place to find a doctor.

93
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:12,916
Sure. No problem. I'll take
you anywhere you wanna go.

94
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,500
Under one condition,
you gotta feed me.

95
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:20,291
[laughing]

96
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:33,166
That ball has to be
around here somewhere.

97
00:11:35,416 --> 00:11:36,916
[CHIAOTZU] I found it!

98
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:43,375
With that one we have five.

99
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:45,833
That leaves us with only
two more balls to get,

100
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:49,250
and we know where one is--
With King Piccolo.

101
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:51,708
We had better stay on our guard.

102
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:56,958
What's the matter?
Is something wrong?!

103
00:11:57,041 --> 00:11:58,666
[ROSHI]
Well, we don't have to worry

104
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,416
about finding those two balls.

105
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,291
According to the radar,
they're together,

106
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:04,083
and headed straight for us!

107
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:11,875
That has to be King Piccolo!
He means to destroy us!

108
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:44,083
[radar beeping]

109
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:46,416
Your Majesty,
the other five Dragon Balls

110
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,458
are headed straight for us!

111
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:50,416
[laughing]

112
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:54,000
How thoughtful of them
to deliver my prize...

113
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:57,625
This day has been fruitful.
It has seen the end of my enemy

114
00:12:57,708 --> 00:13:00,958
and soon I will possess
all seven Dragon Balls!

115
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:04,291
[laughing]

116
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:14,458
All right, we're on
an intercept course.

117
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:16,500
[TIEN thinking]
That fiend! He's mine!

118
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:18,166
Let me make one thing clear.

119
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:20,541
We have no chance
of defeating King Piccolo

120
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:22,125
with hand to hand combat.

121
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:26,291
We must get his Dragon Balls and
call upon the Eternal Dragon.

122
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:29,541
It will be the
Dragon's privilege

123
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:32,541
to remove Piccolo
from this world.

124
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:34,583
Yes, sir.

125
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:37,333
[ROSHI] Tien, take us down
between those two boulders.

126
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:40,333
That's as good a place
as any to make our stand.

127
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:46,291
I admire your courage,
but it was foolish for you

128
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:49,208
to go up against
King Piccolo by yourself.

129
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:54,958
I'm surprised, Yajirobe.
You didn't even lend me a hand.

130
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:56,708
Of course I didn't!

131
00:13:56,791 --> 00:13:59,791
I like you Goku, but not
as much as I like living.

132
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:04,500
[YAJIROBE]
Do I keep going straight?

133
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:06,000
[GOKU] A little to the left.

134
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:09,000
[YAJIROBE] A little?
What kind of direction is that?

135
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:17,916
I like your car.
It sure is nice and fast.

136
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,416
Yeah, it's pretty neat,
all right. I stole it.

137
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:25,833
Just in case you're thinking
what I hope you're not,

138
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:28,166
I wouldn't go up against
King Piccolo again.

139
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,333
It's not wise to push your luck.

140
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:35,541
How... well do you know him?
Who is he?

141
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:39,250
Like I said, it's just
a story I heard as a kid...

142
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:42,166
A terrible tale
that gave me nightmares.

143
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:46,166
A long time ago,
King Piccolo used his power

144
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:48,375
to try and
take over the world.

145
00:14:48,458 --> 00:14:52,250
Fortunately, a brave Martial
Artist--I forget his name--

146
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:54,791
but he was able
to stop the invasion...

147
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:56,166
Or that's the story...

148
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:59,125
I guess we know differently now.

149
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:03,291
Guess so... So, how did
the Martial Artist stop him?

150
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:06,166
I don't know, but I'll bet
it was spectacular,

151
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:07,416
whatever he did...

152
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,916
What's going to happen
once you put

153
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,250
all seven Dragon Balls together?

154
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:13,125
[GOKU]
The Eternal Dragon will appear

155
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:15,041
and make your
wish come true.

156
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:18,000
Whatever you want to
ask for is fine with him.

157
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,083
But you only get one wish.

158
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:24,583
Any wish you want? No way.

159
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:28,291
Yeah, it is true. A little
more to the left, please.

160
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:33,750
[YAJIROBE] If that is true, what
could someone as powerful

161
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:36,250
as King Piccolo
possibly ask for?

162
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:38,791
[GOKU]
Uh, a better personality? Heh.

163
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:45,958
Perfect... soon I will
have all seven Dragon Balls,

164
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:48,291
and my youth will
finally be restored!

165
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:05,041
[ROSHI] Yes! Right there,
see those two rocks?

166
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:06,958
That's where we'll land.

167
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:14,833
[TIEN]
What shall we do first?

168
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:18,166
[ROSHI] Capsulize the plane.
Get it out of sight.

169
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:20,208
Yes, Master.

170
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:21,166
[clears throat]

171
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:22,375
[CHIAOTZU] Oh!

172
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:36,666
Quickly, we can bury the
Dragon Balls in this hole.

173
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:37,708
Right.

174
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:45,291
Piccolo won't find them
so easily here,

175
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:47,750
and it might
just buy us some time.

176
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:49,500
[CHIAOTZU] There we go!

177
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:54,375
[ROSHI] All right, listen...

178
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:57,750
Chiaotzu, you hide
behind that rock over there...

179
00:16:57,833 --> 00:17:00,708
Tien Shinhan and I will snatch
King Piccolo's Dragon Balls

180
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:03,416
while he's searching for ours.

181
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,458
[CHIAOTZU] Got it.

182
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:06,583
[ROSHI]
Once we secure the last two,

183
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:07,958
we'll throw them to Chiaotzu

184
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:09,833
who will bury them
with the other five

185
00:17:09,916 --> 00:17:11,875
and call for
the Sacred Dragon.

186
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:17,333
All you have to say is,
"Come out, Dragon"

187
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:19,625
and tell him the wish.

188
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:20,666
Yes, sir.

189
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:23,500
All right?

190
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:26,458
Mm-hmm. Understood.

191
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:29,583
Ready? They should
be here at any moment...

192
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:31,708
Good luck. Now get going!

193
00:17:44,291 --> 00:17:46,541
Ah! It appears they've
come to a complete stop.

194
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:47,916
They're just waiting.

195
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,791
[laughing]

196
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:51,333
Oh, they're not just waiting.

197
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:55,041
Our prey has set a trap. See,
they're trying to ambush us.

198
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:57,666
Let's play along, for now.

199
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:20,833
Wait.

200
00:18:24,625 --> 00:18:25,833
They're here!

201
00:18:25,916 --> 00:18:28,666
[ROSHI]
They're traveling by airship.

202
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,375
We have arrived, Your Majesty.

203
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:43,958
We are directly above
the Dragon Balls now.

204
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:48,833
Time to get the goodies.

205
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:53,875
[TIEN] There's a chance
they won't come down,

206
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:56,416
or what if King Piccolo decides
to keep his Dragon Balls

207
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,583
on board that ship?

208
00:18:57,666 --> 00:18:59,583
Then we sneak aboard
and take them.

209
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:01,916
Besides, I'd like
to see the view.

210
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:11,500
[PILAF] I don't see any
movement down there.

211
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:14,125
That's because they're hiding...

212
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:17,375
So, they want to
play games, do they?

213
00:19:19,916 --> 00:19:21,208
They're hoping we'll come down

214
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:23,416
so they can
steal our Dragon Balls.

215
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:26,541
I guess I should keep
these in a safe place.

216
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:38,000
I take it the ugly
green guy is King Piccolo.

217
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:40,666
It looks like he just
swallowed the Dragon Balls!

218
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:44,458
Maniacal fiend!
He's smarter than I remembered!

219
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:46,458
The only option for us now
is to knock him over

220
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:49,041
and pump those balls
out of his rotten hide!

221
00:19:57,416 --> 00:20:00,916
We have to fight him
head on, Master Roshi.

222
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:07,708
That's what he
wants us to believe.

223
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:09,750
No, Tien,
you stay out of this.

224
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:12,708
No, Master Roshi!
I must fight Piccolo!

225
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:18,416
You won't do anything,
Tien Shinhan. That's an order.

226
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,875
But Master! You can't do this
to me! I have to fight him!

227
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:32,250
Don't tie my hands... Please!

228
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:35,041
I appreciate your
concern for my safety,

229
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:37,166
but I've taken steps
to protect myself,

230
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:39,166
including a
life-sustaining potion.

231
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:41,458
But you can't do it--Agh!

232
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:44,875
Master, you--

233
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:49,291
[ROSHI] I'm sorry to
have to do this, Tien.

234
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:51,583
It's better for you
to sleep through this one.

235
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:53,500
Too many lives
have been lost already.

236
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:01,666
Your dedication to
our cause is admirable.

237
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:05,250
But I must confess I didn't
take a life-sustaining potion.

238
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:07,083
Never touch the stuff myself.

239
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:10,041
Anyway, if I fail,
you'll be the only one left

240
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:11,333
to defeat that monster.

241
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:13,666
But only as a last ditch effort.

242
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:17,083
Your will is strong, but
your training is incomplete.

243
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:22,500
Tell Goku... I was proud.

244
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:29,875
Chiaotzu! Forget about
the maneuver we discussed.

245
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:31,375
I want you to stay hidden.

246
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:34,875
Do not come out until it's over,
no matter what happens!

247
00:21:34,958 --> 00:21:36,541
Understood?

248
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:38,458
[CHIAOTZU]
Yes, Master. Okay!

249
00:21:45,333 --> 00:21:48,041
Hey, look! There he is!

250
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:54,583
If you want the
Dragon Balls, Piccolo,

251
00:21:54,666 --> 00:21:56,541
you'll have
to come down here!

252
00:21:56,625 --> 00:21:58,875
Oh, so he knows my name.

253
00:21:58,958 --> 00:22:01,666
He's done his homework.
I'm at a disadvantage.

254
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:04,125
Though I'm afraid
knowing my identity

255
00:22:04,208 --> 00:22:06,500
and still putting forth
this challenge

256
00:22:06,583 --> 00:22:09,208
doesn't say much
for his intelligence.

257
00:22:21,458 --> 00:22:23,250
[PICCOLO]
Thank you for the invitation.

258
00:22:23,333 --> 00:22:25,833
I look forward to your agony.

259
00:22:35,125 --> 00:22:37,708
[NARRATOR] The duel
between Master and Majesty

260
00:22:37,791 --> 00:22:39,916
has finally begun.

261
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,666
Can the Turtle Hermit
foil Piccolo's plans

262
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:45,958
for world domination
a second time?

263
00:22:46,041 --> 00:22:50,500
Or will he be consumed by
the monster's awesome power?

264
00:22:50,583 --> 00:22:54,125
Find out next time,
on Dragon Ball!
