00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,625
[NARRATOR]
Previously on Dragon Ball,

2
00:02:13,708 --> 00:02:17,041
Mercenary Tao returned
as a vengeful cyborg

3
00:02:17,125 --> 00:02:20,125
bent on destroying Tien
Shinhan in the first match

4
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:22,333
of the World Martial
Arts Tournament.

5
00:02:22,416 --> 00:02:26,583
However, one blow from
Tien ended his evil plot.

6
00:02:26,666 --> 00:02:29,208
Love was in the air as Goku

7
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:31,500
swept his opponent
off her feet...

8
00:02:31,583 --> 00:02:36,041
After identifying herself as
ChiChi, Goku's childhood friend,

9
00:02:36,125 --> 00:02:38,916
the two quickly became
engaged to be married...

10
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,541
Goku was confused, but the
crowd certainly approved.

11
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:50,375
[NARRATOR]
The third match saw Junior,

12
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:53,750
King Piccolo's alter ego,
take on Krillin...

13
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:56,583
Junior assumed his
victory would be swift,

14
00:02:56,666 --> 00:03:00,250
but Krillin's fighting skills
took him by surprise.

15

[KRILLIN chuckles]

18
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:13,750
[NARRATOR] It seemed both
warriors were evenly matched.

19
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:19,125
That is, until Junior threatened
to unleash his full power.

20
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:22,583
[PICCOLO JR.] I shall give you
my full power. Unrestrained!

21
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:25,708
[NARRATOR] Krillin responded
with unflinching determination

22
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:29,625
as Junior escalated the
match into an all-out war.

23
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:32,791
And now, the battle continues!

[KRILLIN grunts]

26
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:25,708
Goku... How powerful do you
think Junior really is?

27
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:27,750
[GOKU]
I think we're about to find out.

That Junior guy
gives me the creeps.

31
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:55,916
He's just staring at Krillin.

32
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,333
I've seen walls that are
more exciting than this.

33
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:14,833
[TIEN thinking] Amazing...
His spirit energy is so strong.

34
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:17,375
I can actually see his aura.

35

[chuckles]

36
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:42,291
Be smart, Krillin.

37
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:45,833
Take this chance I'm
offering you to withdraw.

38
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:51,833
Challenging me is a mistake.

Uh-oh. It looks like things

are heating up in the ring!

Attempting to
scare his opponent,

43
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:04,125
Junior has advised Krillin
to withdraw from the match.

you're ready for it?

Not yet.

interfere with my plans

for world domination. [laughs]

than any fighter could
hope to muster,

to stand down.

[CROWD cheers]

164
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:22,708
[PUAR] Good luck, Yamcha! You're
the best! The B-E-S-T, best!

165
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:25,000
He knows how to spell!

166
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:28,083
I almost feel sorry for that
guy having to fight Yamcha.

167
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:30,083
I don't think this'll
take very long.

168
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:33,291
Right. One punch from Yamcha,
and it's lights out!

169
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,291
[giggles]

[OOLONG grumbles]

171
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:41,166
I'm very honored that you would
take the time to fight me.

172
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:42,375
[YAMCHA]
Huh?

173
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:45,208
Yeah... No problem.
It's kinda what I do.

174
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:52,291
Yamcha must be one of
Goku's close friends.

175
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:56,750
It's too bad he's fighting that
nerd. There's no way he'll win.

176
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:59,833
[ANNOUNCER]
Ready contestants... And begin!

177
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:05,958
[YAMCHA thinking]
He's so silly.

178
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,666
That's an interesting
technique you got there.

179
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:14,041
Feel free to attack
whenever you're ready.

180
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:16,333
Okay. I appreciate
your kindness.

181
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,416
No problem.

182
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:27,041
Ya know, I can't help but notice

183
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:28,750
how serious you've
been lately...

184
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:32,583
Is, uh, something the matter?
You used to be so cheerful.

185
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:35,500
Sorry... I've been preoccupied.

186
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:38,125
I have a strange
feeling about Hero.

187
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:39,625
Oh.

188
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:46,250
Don't worry... Everyone here
thinks he's strange.

189
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:51,666
That about does it
for the warm up.

190
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:54,708
I'm limber and ready for action.

191
00:15:54,791 --> 00:15:57,208
All right, go ahead.
Let's see what you got.

192
00:15:57,291 --> 00:16:08,541
[HERO yelling]

[laughing]

194
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:11,583
That guy makes a great clown!

195
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:14,458
Yamcha... Go easy on him, okay?!

196
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:23,250
[HERO yells]

197
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:24,750

[CROWD laughing]

202
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:46,791
[ANNOUNCER]
In a moment of pure slapstick,

203
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:48,291
Hero lost his balance,

204
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:51,500
accidentally kicking
Yamcha's side in the process.

205
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:55,166
Who knew clumsy could be
such an effective weapon!

206
00:16:57,375 --> 00:16:58,791
[laughs]

207
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:00,916
For someone who can't fight,
you're doin' pretty good...

208
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,333
With moves like that,
who knows what's next.

209
00:17:03,416 --> 00:17:08,833
Uh, yes. Thank you. I mean,
sorry. Now I'm embarrassed, I...

210
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:11,125
[CROWD laughing]

211
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:12,875
[YAMCHA thinking]
I'm the one who's embarrassed!

212
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:15,583
This fight should have
been over before it began.

213
00:17:15,666 --> 00:17:19,125
I'd better end this now, while
I still have some credibility!

214
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:24,916
Listen, Hero, you seem like a
nice guy, but this is a match.

215
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,166
So why don't we get back to it

216
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:28,791
and save the laughter
for after the fight.

217
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:31,708
It'll be all over
soon, I promise.

218
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:37,541
[YAMCHA thinking] I don't
wanna hurt the old fella.

219
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:39,666
I'll just kick him
out of the ring.

220
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:44,583
[yells]

221
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:46,250

[CROWD laughs]

225
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:07,291
[ANNOUNCER]
Ooh! That looked painful.

226
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:09,458
Who would have thought
Yamcha could fall victim

227
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:11,833
to circumstance a second time?

228
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:14,208
So much for experience.
At this rate,

229
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:17,916
accident-prone Hero will
chalk up another win in no time.

230
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:20,416
[chuckles]

231
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,041
Since this was a
self-inflicted injury,

232
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:24,791
we will forgo the countdown

233
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:27,708
and allow poor
Yamcha to recover.

234
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:34,791
[CROWD laughing]

235
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:37,541
Oh boy, poor Yamcha.

236
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:46,583
That's a bad hit, but
he'll recover... Right?

237
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:50,833
His body, but not... his pride.

238
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:54,625
[ROSHI thinking] Hero...
Nothing happens by accident.

239
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:59,791
[YAMCHA whimpering]

240
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:04,041
Ha-How nice of Yamcha to give us
a preview of his victory dance.

241
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:07,583
Let's show him our support
with a big round of applause.

242
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:08,833
Audience!

[CROWD cheers]

244
00:19:17,708 --> 00:19:19,916
[YAMCHA thinking]
I trained three years for this?

245
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,333
Say, that was a toughie.

246
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:24,083
Maybe you should've
warmed up first...

247
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:25,625
I can give you a few pointers...

248
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:28,791
I have some.

249
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:33,375
Ha, ha, ha, I appreciate your
concern, but as you can see,

250
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:35,291
I'm in fantastic shape!

251
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:38,541
Oh, I understand...
Yeah, don't worry...

252
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:42,166
Accidents happen
to me all the time.

253
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:44,000
It must be very difficult

254
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:47,500
struggling in one's
chosen profession.

255
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:50,833
You seem awfully confident,
especially for someone

256
00:19:50,916 --> 00:19:53,083
who has so little
experience in the ring.

257
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:55,875
You don't really expect
to beat me, do you?

258
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:57,333
I'm an optimist.

259
00:19:57,416 --> 00:19:58,750
[laughs]

260
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:01,750
Optimism is great...
But to defeat me,

261
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:04,375
you'd need nothing
short of a miracle.

262
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:07,375
Miracles happen every day.

263
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:09,416
Come on, you're not a fighter.

264
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:14,041
Don't be so sure. What you see
isn't always what you get...

265
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:18,250
And besides, I've done
a good job so far.

266
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:22,333
Yeah... When it comes
to luck, you're powerful.

267
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:24,833
Thanks. So, are you
ready for a surprise?

268
00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:27,333
[YAMCHA]
Uh-huh...

269
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:29,166

[HERO chuckling]

275
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:52,625
You were paying so much
attention to my theatrics,

276
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:55,708
you never realized the
subtle moves I was making...

277
00:20:55,791 --> 00:20:57,875
Didn't your master
ever teach you,

278
00:20:57,958 --> 00:21:01,500
that you should never judge
power by appearance?

279
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,916
If you take nothing else
from this fight...

280
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
remember the golden rule.

281
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:12,416
Perception is a great defense.

282
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:17,416
I was right. It's all an act.
I'll bet even his name is phony.

[whimpering]

284

[YAMCHA]
I see what you mean.

285
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:27,875
Your act was very
convincing... It fooled me.

286
00:21:27,958 --> 00:21:30,125
Yeah. I'm good.

287
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:34,333
Oh, yes... When it comes
to lies, you're a master!

288
00:21:34,416 --> 00:21:35,583
Doh...?

289
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:38,916
I don't believe in using
deception as a tool...

290
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I fight my battles
the old-fashioned way!

291
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:45,500
Poor boy. And I thought
I was an optimist...

292
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:48,041
You must enjoy humiliation.

293
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:50,875
[yells]

294
00:21:50,958 --> 00:21:53,208
All right. We'll do it your way.

295
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:55,041
It's certainly
more entertaining.

Where'd he come from?

00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:31,250
Don't stop now...
Is that all you've got?

308
00:22:36,375 --> 00:22:40,666
[NARRATOR] The mysterious Hero
is obviously a skilled fighter,

309
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:43,125
but who is he really?

310
00:22:43,208 --> 00:22:48,416
Will Yamcha's skill be
enough to defeat him?

311
