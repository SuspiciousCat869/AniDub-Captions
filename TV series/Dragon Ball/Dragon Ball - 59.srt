00:02:12,958 --> 00:02:15,333
[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball...

2
00:02:15,416 --> 00:02:17,916
Goku's search led him
to the land of Korin,

3
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,583
where he discovered Captain
Yellow of the Red Ribbon Army

4
00:02:20,666 --> 00:02:23,625
in the midst of another scheme
to steal a Dragon Ball.

5
00:02:23,708 --> 00:02:25,166
[BORA] What's that?

6
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:27,750
[NARRATOR] Goku quickly sent
the despicable captain's plans

7
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:30,791
into a tailspin, and
made some new friends

8
00:02:30,875 --> 00:02:33,458
with a daring rescue
on the Flying Nimbus.

9
00:02:33,541 --> 00:02:34,958
[GOKU chuckles]

10
00:02:35,041 --> 00:02:36,291
Hel-lo!

11
00:02:36,375 --> 00:02:38,125
[NARRATOR] His good deeds
did not go unrewarded.

12
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:39,833
[GOKU]
The Four-Star Dragon Ball!

13
00:02:39,916 --> 00:02:42,916
I can't believe I finally found
my Grandpa's Dragon Ball!

14
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,583
[GOKU giggles]

15
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:46,791
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile,
at Red Ribbon headquarters,

16
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:49,958
plans were being made to cut
Goku's celebration short!

17
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:51,625
[RED] Listen up, Yellow!

18
00:02:51,708 --> 00:02:54,083
[NARRATOR] Fed up with the
repeated failure of his men,

19
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:56,666
Commander Red has called in
some outside help;

20
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,958
The world's most
notorious assassin...

21
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:01,125
[TAO] I'm Mercenary Tao.

22
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:30,708
[GUARDS gasp]

23
00:03:39,416 --> 00:03:42,583
Um, General?
Welcome back!

24
00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:44,500
Hmph!

25
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:45,583
[GUARD A gasps]

26
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:47,333
Don't give me your
false sentiments.

27
00:03:47,416 --> 00:03:49,625
You were all glad
to be rid of me.

28
00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:51,708
So, save it.

29
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:55,250
[GUARD A] Excuse me,
sir! Forgive me!

30
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:07,250
Thanks for meeting me,
Mercenary Tao.

31
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:08,458
We have this situation--

32
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:10,666
One thing before
we get started...

33
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:14,000
I must tell you my
fee is very expensive.

34
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:17,500
Ah, I can assure you,
if you complete our mission,

35
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:19,541
we will pay you handsomely.

36
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:21,333
Then my going rate...

37
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:24,208
...is ten billion a head.

38
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:26,291
Ten... billion apiece?

39
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:27,708
[TAO] Did I stutter?

40
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:30,416
Though, I am having a
special 20th anniversary sale.

41
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,708
For a limited time only,

42
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:33,791
you get a quality slaying
at a bargain price.

43
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:35,875
All services are
fifty percent off.

44
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:36,958
[RED gasps]

45
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:38,000
You heard right.

46
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:41,666
A measly five...
billion... zeni.

47
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:44,125
That's... reasonable.

48
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:45,958
How can we be
sure, though...

49
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:48,375
that you are who
you say you are?

50
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:51,666
Would you like to try me out?

51
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,833
Oh, no, that
won't be necessary.

52
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:55,250
[knocking at door]

53
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:56,208
Who is it?

54
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:57,750
[BLUE] General Blue!

55
00:04:57,833 --> 00:04:59,041
[RED growls]

56
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:00,750
He's back?

57
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:02,208
Come in!

58
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:09,416
I have returned to duty, sir.

59
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,625
How could you come back here?

60
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:13,583
Well, it was quite a hassle.

61
00:05:13,666 --> 00:05:16,000
I was forced to steal
a plane and a car and--

62
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:18,791
[RED] That's not what I meant!

63
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:22,125
You failed to get the
Dragon Ball from the kid...

64
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:25,958
And you have the nerve to
come here empty handed?

65
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:26,666
[BLUE gasps]

66
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,666
But he's... tricky...

67
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:31,166
I don't need your excuses.

68
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:34,333
But, Commander,
I was able to confiscate

69
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:35,791
the Dragon Radar from him.

70
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:37,458
[STAFF OFFICER gasps]

71
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:38,791
Here it is!

72
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:41,458
It easily hones in on the
Dragon Ball's location,

73
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:44,166
and it's extremely
accurate, too.

74
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:48,250
It's smaller
than I expected.

75
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:50,791
It'll take me no time to
secure all the Dragon Balls

76
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:52,500
with this little device. Ha, ha!

77
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:56,250
[RED chuckles]

78
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:59,000
[RED] A good find,
I'll give you that...

79
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:00,500
But...

80
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:03,375
if I recall, your assignment
was to get the Dragon Balls.

81
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:04,708
[BLUE gulps]

82
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:06,500
[RED] You know how
it works around here.

83
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:08,916
Those who cannot achieve
results are punished.

84
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,291
And severely...

85
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:11,750
[BLUE whimpers]

86
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:15,458
N-No...!

87
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:18,333
[BLUE whimpers]

88
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:26,250
[RED] However, since you've been
of some value to us in the past,

89
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:28,625
I'll give you a chance
to save yourself.

90
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:30,583
How?

91
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:33,791
I will be willing to let you
live if you fight Mercenary Tao

92
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:36,708
here and defeat him.

93
00:06:36,791 --> 00:06:38,583
Mercenary Tao?

94
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:41,375
[TAO] Mm-hmm...

95
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:42,833
[STAFF OFFICER] Ah...

96
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:50,708
So, what d'ya think?

97
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:51,875
You in?

98
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:54,250
Yes!

99
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:57,166
Thank you for the
opportunity, Commander.

100
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,666
[BLUE chuckles]

101
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:12,625
So the ball holds
special power.

102
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:17,666
Now I understand why the army
was so determined to acquire it.

103
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,708
But I don't really care
about the wishes

104
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:21,416
or anything like that.

105
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,500
I was only looking
for this Dragon Ball

106
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:25,625
because it belonged
to my grandpa.

107
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:28,833
[BORA] Oh... Good.

108
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:32,041
You have few wants.
That's fortunate.

109
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:34,541
Daddy, what do you
mean by that?

110
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:36,291
You see, son...

111
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:39,333
Too many desires can
drive a person mad...

112
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:43,916
I was wondering.

113
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,166
What is that big pole sticking
out of the ground for?

114
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:50,875
The tower...

115
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:53,416
It is a sacred symbol
of my people.

116
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:57,375
To our tribe, it is a very
important and honored landmark.

117
00:07:57,458 --> 00:08:00,166
We call it the Korin Tower.

118
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:05,666
[BORA] I learned of the
legend from my grandfather

119
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:08,000
when I was Upa's age.

120
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:11,791
It is a story that has been
told for many generations...

121
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:19,625
[BORA] But still we wait,
after all this time,

122
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:24,291
for the arrival of someone
who can pass the test...

123
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:27,583
[GOKU] What do you
mean? What test?

124
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:30,333
[BORA] It is said that
if any person can climb

125
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:33,375
to the top of this
tower unaided,

126
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:37,666
he will find the great noble
guardian waiting for him there.

127
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:40,750
[BORA] The guardian will
then give him a cup

128
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:43,250
of cold water to drink...

129
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,250
[BORA] And with that single sip,

130
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:50,250
the climber's abilities
will increase dramatically.

131
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:52,000
[GOKU] Really?

132
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:54,000
[BORA] As incredible
as it sounds,

133
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:57,416
my people have always
believed it to be true.

134
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:01,541
[GOKU] So if I climbed
all the way up there,

135
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:03,208
I'd get a lot
stronger, right?

136
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:04,666
Have you ever tried it?

137
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:07,791
Once when I was young.

138
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:10,375
But I couldn't make it
all the way to the top.

139
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:14,666
Anyway, no one has ever been
successful in the attempt.

140
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,041
But...

141
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:18,875
I heard that a long time ago
one person did make it

142
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:22,916
A compelling story,
but only... a myth.

143
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,375
It's so... gigantic!

144
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,916
[GOKU] So, why do you live here?

145
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,416
Because of the tower...

146
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,333
My family has been guarding
it for generations.

147
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:37,000
It is our ancestral duty.

148
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:38,375
It is my job.

149
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:40,750
I am the protector of the land.

150
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:44,208
Oh... I see...

151
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:47,708
Do you think it would be okay if
I took my Nimbus to the top?

152
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,833
So you're the world
famous assassin,

153
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:07,958
the one they call
Mercenary Tao?

154
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:10,125
Do you want
my autograph?

155
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:12,166
[BLUE laughs]

156
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:14,041
Well, aren't you amusing...?

157
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:17,333
I suppose I'll have to put
an end to your arrogance.

158
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:20,708
I don't work for free.
This will cost you.

159
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:22,041
Understand?

160
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:25,458
[RED] That's fine...
Let's get on with the show!

161
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:28,541
You should have a weapon
handy, you know, just in case.

162
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:31,791
[TAO] Hmph!

163
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:34,250
I won't even need
my hands and feet.

164
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:37,500
I'll just use my
tongue to beat you.

165
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:39,458
I wouldn't count on it.

166
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:43,708
[BLUE chuckles]

167
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:57,583
Begin!

168
00:10:57,666 --> 00:10:59,041
[BLUE chuckles]

169
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:02,541

[BLUE yells]

171
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,291
Heh... Not bad!

172
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:24,958
Now... try this!

173
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:30,000
[BLUE growls]

174
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:39,583
[growling continues]

175
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:50,875
[BLUE chuckles]

176
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:53,666
Well, how do you like
being paralyzed?

177
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,916
[BLUE grunts]

178
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,916
[bones crack]

179
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,375
[BLUE gasps]

180
00:11:59,083 --> 00:12:00,458
[TAO sighs]

181
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:01,625
Excuse me.

182
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:03,625
What was that?

183
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:05,083
Impossible!

184
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:08,333
[BOTH gasp]

185
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:11,041
General Blue's finishing
move is completely useless!

186
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:15,125
It's astounding!

187
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:20,000
[TAO] Hmmm...

188
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:24,833
[BLUE yells]

189
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:28,416
[BLUE grunts]

190
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,250
[BOTH gasp]

191
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:37,291
[BLUE whimpers]

192
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:47,791
[TAO] Mmm...

193
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:51,375
I'd say you've got
that problem licked!

194
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:55,833
[RED] He... killed...
him with... one strike!

195
00:12:55,916 --> 00:12:57,333
[STAFF OFFICER]
I can't believe it...!

196
00:12:57,416 --> 00:13:00,375
He definitely lives up
to his reputation!

197
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:04,750
Now.

198
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:08,166
Since playtime is over,
why don't you tell me about

199
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:10,791
the real target so I
can finally get to work?

200
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,416
So he's just a little boy.

201
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,791
Yes, technically speaking,
but he's no ordinary kid.

202
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:43,666
He's incredibly strong.

203
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,791
Well... it doesn't
really matter.

204
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:48,416
I will annihilate
any man, woman, or child

205
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,708
as long as the price is right.

206
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:52,125
[STAFF OFFICER]
You're a good man.

207
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:54,875
By the way, after you
eliminate the boy, search him.

208
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:57,291
He will have in his
possession four special balls.

209
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:59,916
They're called Dragon Balls,
and they're very valuable.

210
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,916
You are to bring
those back to me.

211
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,166
They look just like this.

212
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:11,625
[TAO] Mmm...

213
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:14,708
That's going to cost you extra.

214
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:15,791
No problem.

215
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:17,791
In fact if anyone
gets in your way,

216
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:21,458
just do away with
them, too. We'll pay.

217
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:22,708
Very well...

218
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:25,041
But any extra killings
are twice the price...

219
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:27,666
[RED gasps]

220
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,000
This place, "Korin".

221
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:32,250
It's about 1400 miles to
the northeast, is it not?

222
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:35,125
I'll have the jet prepared
for you right away.

223
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:38,166
That's not necessary...

224
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,416
It'll take too long by airplane.

225
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,875
Huh?!

226
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:50,750
[TAO] Mmm... Hmm...

227
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:53,666
Would it be possible for me to
borrow this column from you?

228
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:57,708
Uh, what d'ya want...
uh, with that pillar?

229
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,166
[TAO] Mmm...

230
00:15:03,791 --> 00:15:05,166
[BOTH] Uhh...

231
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:08,708
[BOTH gasp]

232
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:14,458
[TAO] Let's see... 1400 miles.

233
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:17,083
I should be back
in about 30 minutes.

234
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,583
Huh...?

235
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:23,208
[TAO laughs]

236
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:36,916
Amazing...

237
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,833
T hat Tao is simply amazing.

238
00:15:38,916 --> 00:15:40,333
[RED laughs]

239
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:43,791
After all this time, the Dragon
Balls are going to be mine!

240
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:09,833
[GOKU] Huh?

241
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:12,250
[GOKU giggles]

242
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:15,416
Wow! That sure smells good!

243
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:19,666
[GOKU chuckles]

244
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:24,083
[GOKU slurps]

245
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:25,333
[UPA laughs]

246
00:16:25,416 --> 00:16:26,875
Have as much as you want.

247
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,375
Thank you!

248
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:09,916
[UPA laughs]

249
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:29,916
[GOKU] This is great!

250
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I'll be better at everything
once I go up there!

251
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:37,708
Do not get your hopes up,
my young friend...

252
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,875
It may only be a legend.

253
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:41,166
[GOKU] Oh...

254
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:43,000
I want to try it anyway!

255
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:45,458
[UPA] But you're
already strong!

256
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:49,375
I'm not the strongest though,
so it's still worth the chance!

257
00:17:49,458 --> 00:17:52,458
Yeah! It's definitely
worth it to be the best!

258
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:54,083
[GOKU chuckles]

259
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:58,083
Perhaps, but, it will
not be an easy task.

260
00:17:58,166 --> 00:18:00,958
Have a lot of people
tried to climb the tower?

261
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:02,166
Besides you?

262
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:05,000
Yes. There are many
who have attempted it.

263
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:06,250
[GOKU] Oh...

264
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:08,458
But... they all have failed.

265
00:18:08,541 --> 00:18:09,625
[GOKU] Ohh...

266
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:12,125
The tower is much taller
than you imagine.

267
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:14,541
It takes many
days to scale it.

268
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:17,916
Those who try often eat
their provisions too soon,

269
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,458
and fall off from
weakness and hunger...

270
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:24,041
Those who attempt the climb
by plane fare no better.

271
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:25,916
Oh? How come?

272
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,250
They run out of fuel,
before they ever seen the top...

273
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:32,625
It's that far away?

274
00:18:32,708 --> 00:18:35,375
[BORA] So you see,
those who defy the rules,

275
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:37,666
or who attempt the
climb unprepared

276
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:40,500
do not generally
get a second chance.

277
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:42,125
Oh.

278
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:44,083
[UPA] Oh.

279
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:45,583
What's that, Daddy?

280
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:46,416
Huh?

281
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,541
That thing... in the sky!

282
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:50,500
[GOKU] I can see a person on it.

283
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:00,375
[GOKU yells]

284
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:01,000
Watch out!

285
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:02,708
[BORA] Hang on!

286
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:05,166
[GOKU yells]

287
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:19,291
Pleased to kill you.

288
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,250
[BORA] What are you doing?!
You nearly hit us!

289
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:25,958
[TAO] Hmph.

290
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:27,625
Well, that's the idea...

291
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,125
I'm a hit man.

292
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:31,541
Huh? A hit man?

293
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:35,333
Whoever you are, your kind
is not welcome in Korin.

294
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:38,458
[TAO] The name is Tao.
And I won't be staying long.

295
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:40,000
I've simply come for the boy.

296
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:40,833
[BORA] What?

297
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:43,416
But I don't know you, do I?

298
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,208
Why did you come to see me?

299
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:50,000
The Red Ribbon Army has sent me
here to tie up some loose ends.

300
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:52,083
[GOKU growls] Red Ribbon?!

301
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:54,083
Yes. You're getting
in the way of their hunt

302
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:56,958
for the "Dragon Balls",
so you must be destroyed.

303
00:19:57,041 --> 00:20:00,083
[GOKU growls] Again?!
They won't quit!

304
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:00,958
[UPA gasps]

305
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:02,708
Daddy, help him!

306
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:05,583
Please don't let them hurt Goku!

307
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:06,916
Now wait a minute.

308
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,291
That boy you are threatening
saved my son's life.

309
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:12,375
If you have come here
looking for a fight,

310
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:15,208
you will have to
deal with me first!

311
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:17,833
[TAO growls]

312
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:18,916
It's alright!

313
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,291
I think I can handle him!

314
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:24,916
It is my obligation to protect
this land from enemies.

315
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Now, Son, stay back.

316
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:29,208
Okay!

317
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:29,958
[TAO chuckles]

318
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:31,458
What a fool!

319
00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:33,916
Why would you choose
to take the fall?

320
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:39,208
Enough talk!

321
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:42,708
Daddy! Be careful!

322
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:54,125
[TAO] Hmm...

323
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:56,833
I'll bet you fancy
yourself a trained fighter.

324
00:20:56,916 --> 00:20:59,333
Let's see if you
can handle this.

[TAO] What's the matter?

329
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:09,250
Is it stuck? That's too bad.

Hey! My Daddy!

Still stuck? That's okay,
I'll move it for you.

[NARRATOR] It would seem that
Mercenary Tao's reputation

358
00:22:36,916 --> 00:22:39,000
as the world's most
dangerous assassin

359
00:22:39,083 --> 00:22:41,083
has not been exaggerated.

Now, this cold and
calculating villain

361
00:22:43,958 --> 00:22:46,333
has set his steely
gaze on our hero.

Goku faces the greatest
challenge of his life,

on the next heart-stopping
episode of Dragon Ball.
