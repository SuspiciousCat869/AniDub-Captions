Last time on Dragon Ball,

00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:16,875
Junior grew larger
than life, literally.

3
00:02:16,958 --> 00:02:20,416
Presenting Goku with the biggest
obstacle he had ever faced.

00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,958
As he towered above the
arena, it was evident

5
00:02:23,041 --> 00:02:27,500
that King Piccolo's offspring
was "junior" no more.

being crushed.

he got hit with a solid

[NARRATOR] Though battered,

such unyielding determination

Is that so?

167
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,375
[KRILLIN]
Why are they talking?

168
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:31,333
The entire planet
could be destroyed

169
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:35,333
if Junior isn't defeated.
What is there to discuss?

170
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:38,875
Hm. Very little, I'm sure.

171
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:41,666
A true warrior does not
contemplate the fate

172
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:44,333
of the world, only the
strength of his enemy.

173
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:47,583
For him, nothing exists
beyond the battlefield.

174
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:52,708
He knows only victory or defeat.

175
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:56,125
Hit me! I owe you a free punch.

176
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:58,375
Hm? A free punch?

177
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:03,041
Yeah, hit me to make up for the
punch that Kami just blocked.

178
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:06,541
[GOKU]
What are you waiting for?!

179
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:10,041
Hit me so we can
continue the match!

180
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:13,041
Heh. If you insist on it.

181
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,666
[PICCOLO JR. grunts]

182
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,125
[GOKU yelps]

183
00:13:18,416 --> 00:13:20,041
Oh, Goku!

184
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:29,083
[groaning] Sure am glad
they put a wall here.

185
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:33,625
[KRILLIN] Only Goku
could smile after that.

186
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:36,500
[ROSHI]
He's nothing if not honest.

187
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:54,750
[GOKU panting]

188
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:56,291
[PICCOLO JR. chuckles]

189
00:13:56,375 --> 00:14:00,750
Should we ask for a time-out
so you can catch your breath?

190
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:03,458
[GOKU] No, but feel
free if you're tired.

191
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:08,000
It looks like... It looks
like your antenna are drooping.

192
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:13,375
Now Goku, before we proceed,

193
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:16,500
think this through
very carefully.

194
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:18,833
If we act now,
we can stop him together.

195
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:22,500
There may not be
a second chance.

196
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:26,208
Thanks for your concern,
but I've made my decision.

197
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:31,208
I have to defeat him alone.
It's just something I must do.

198
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:33,958
[KAMI sighs]

199
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:37,125
--[TIEN] Kami!
--[KAMI] Hm?

200
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:43,666
I know you mean well, but Goku
is an accomplished fighter.

201
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:46,208
He's saved the world
more than once.

202
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:59,208
Don't worry. Hm. We're a team.

203
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:03,625
If things get too bad,
we'll take out Junior together.

204
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:08,416
[PICCOLO JR. laughs] Good one.
Your friends are so loyal.

205
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:11,416
And foolish. A bunch
of inept weaklings

206
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:15,500
coming to the rescue of their
idol. I'd pay zeni to see that.

207
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:18,208
I'll show you inept!

208
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:19,833
[BULMA, CHICHI gasp]

209
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:23,791
You are way out of your league,
pretty boy, and you know it!

210
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:26,666
[TIEN growls]

211
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:29,458
We'll show him... Right?

212
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:32,583
I hate to admit it,
but Junior is correct.

213
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:34,583
Goku is the only one among us

214
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:38,125
who can keep up with
his tremendous speed.

215
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:44,708
[PICCOLO JR. laughs]

216
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:46,041
[PICCOLO JR.]
You idiot!

217
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:49,666
It took you this long to
realize my supremacy?!

218
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:52,541
[laughing]

219
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:58,875
Listen, Goku.

220
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:02,750
I still think you're making
the wrong decision,

221
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:06,416
going up against Junior
by yourself is folly,

222
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:11,291
but if you insist, do not
stop until he's exterminated.

223
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:12,666
--I will fall as well,
--[PICCOLO JR. laughs]

224
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:15,416
but you can resuscitate
me using the Dragon Balls.

225
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:20,000
Hm. I won't fail. Thank you
for your confidence, Kami.

226
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:21,708
[KAMI]
Mm.

227
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:26,416
[PICCOLOR JR.] Ha! You really
believe you'll win, don't you?

228
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:32,500
[laughs] Stop lying
to yourself. Ha!

229
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:34,750
Your threats don't worry me.

230
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:38,208
I've already seen
your best technique.

231
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:44,250
Not hardly. You haven't
seen anything yet.

232
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:48,208
[KAMI thinking]
Goku, such a strange young man.

233
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:50,666
His strength, it's unfathomable.

234
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:53,041
He seems to be getting
stronger and stronger

235
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:55,083
every time he fights.

236
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:57,708
His power has increased
to such a degree

237
00:16:57,791 --> 00:16:59,958
that he's even surpassed me.

238
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:02,250
I didn't notice it until now.

239
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:05,666
If he's to become the
warrior I know he can be,

240
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:11,041
I have to give him the room to
grow. He must face Junior alone.

241
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:13,375
[PICCOLO JR.] Your arrogance,
it's astounding!

242
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:18,583
You really believe you
can beat me? Beat me!

243
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:23,583
Yes. Hm.

244
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:26,625
You fool! Are you so
simply so moronic,

245
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:28,875
so moronic that you
can't comprehend

246
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:30,833
the impossible odds before you?

247
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:34,958
I am infinitely stronger
than I was three years ago!

248
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:36,750
Three years is a long time,

249
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:40,625
and you're the fool if you think
I haven't changed as well.

with anything new?!
