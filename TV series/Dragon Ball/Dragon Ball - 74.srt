[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball,

2
00:02:16,375 --> 00:02:19,000
Goku took on the fourth
challenger in a bizarre

3
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:22,666
tournament to determine the
fate of the seventh Dragon Ball.

4
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:37,166
Lucky shot.

5
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,166
Goku, get out of there!

6
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:48,291
He's going to use your
thoughts to destroy you!

7
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,250
Stop! What are you doing?!
You're going too far!

00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:54,875
[ALL gasp]

00:02:55,791 --> 00:02:57,875
[NARRATOR] The winged warrior
threatened Goku

10
00:02:57,958 --> 00:02:59,833
with his Devilmite Beam,

11
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:02,000
a deadly ability
which allows him

12
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:04,375
to convert his opponent's
negative thoughts

13
00:03:04,458 --> 00:03:08,083
into destructive rays
of pure energy.

14
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:34,833
Master, I'm confused.
What is a Devilmite beam?

15
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:37,333
It is a force of
unimaginable evil

16
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:39,083
that has destroyed more lives

17
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:42,041
than any war or
pestilence combined.

18
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:46,208
[ROSHI]
Long ago,

19
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:48,625
there was a mighty
but compassionate warrior.

20
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:50,875
His power was beyond measure,

21
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:54,125
yet many foolish upstarts
tried to destroy him

22
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:56,958
in hopes of making
a name for themselves.

23
00:03:57,041 --> 00:04:00,125
They were all unsuccessful,
until one day,

24
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:02,125
the devil man appeared.

25
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:05,583
Knowing he could not compete
against the warrior's strength,

26
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:08,416
the devil man
attacked using his mind.

27
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,125
He discovered he could exploit

28
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:14,000
his opponent's negative
thoughts, no matter how faint,

29
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:18,125
and convert them into an
energy beam of immense power:

30
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:20,500
The Devilmite Beam.

31
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:25,333
It amplified any dark thought,
anger, malice, aggression,

32
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:28,958
and caused it to expand until
his opponent's heart

33
00:04:29,041 --> 00:04:31,083
literally exploded.

34
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:38,291
[ROSHI] It was the death
of a great hero,

35
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:41,333
and the birth of
an even greater evil.

36
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:48,541
You've known
about this all along

37
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:51,291
and yet you let Goku
go out there by himself?

38
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:52,708
--[gasping]
--What?!

39
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:56,083
The least you could have done
was warn him! Really!

40
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:58,916
It's too late now, Bulma.

Rise! Rise!

00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:26,291
Slowly tear this boy apart!

[laughing maniacally]

49
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:32,000
Now you die!

No! Stop it!

Wow... Can you make
a color besides pink?

58
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:26,791
I don't get it.

00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:44,916
[neck cracking]

60
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,916
Are you ready to start now?

61
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:53,083
This kid is not normal.

62
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:02,875
Devilmite Beam, hear my command!

63
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:05,958
Strike the boy down
where he stands!

64
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:10,000
Now...

65
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:13,250
...prepare to die!

66
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:14,708
The lightning adds a nice touch,

67
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:17,208
but do you think the
explosions are over-the-top?

68
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:22,583
You will not survive
this time, runt.

Darkness, hear me...
Through flesh and bone swell!

[yelling]

00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:15,291
No!

76
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:18,791
I need a vacation!

77
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:23,375
Upa... Look up.

78
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:28,500
Way to go, kid!
You really showed him!

79
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:30,541
We won!

00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:33,375
I knew you could do it, Goku!

81
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:35,291
This doesn't make any sense!

82
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:38,958
The Devilmite Beam
works on everyone.

83
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:40,958
For you to be
immune to its power

84
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:45,166
means you don't carry
a single negative thought!

85
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:48,375
Huh... I guess I don't.

86
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:51,250
A pure mind, void of evil?

87
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:54,458
Not even my crystal ball
could have seen that coming...

88
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:03,541
It's over! What a relief!

89
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:06,541
Although I must say I didn't
doubt Goku for a minute.

90
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:08,833
Yes, but it
was not Goku's skill

91
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:11,416
that saved his life,
merely chance...

92
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,291
And their battle
has not ended just yet.

93
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:17,208
Still, his performance
against that Devilmite Beam

94
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:18,458
was impressive.

95
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:20,750
I can't help but wonder
how you would have done.

96
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:26,125
I wouldn't have gotten
a second chance.

you'd do under the beam?

Beware...

The Devilmite Beam
isn't my only weapon...

You have weapons! I don't!

This isn't a fair fight!

You can beat him, Goku!

Hey, watch out for his spear!

113

If you don't fight fair,
it's your choice,

but I'm not giving up!

You're going down, boy,

going to put you there!

He skipped extraordinary
and went straight to miraculous.

Just one more match and
then I can get the Dragon Ball!

00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:23,875
Indeed. Let's bring this
out into the light of day

168
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:26,333
where everyone
can see your victory!

169
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:31,583
[laughing]

170
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:56,250
I hate disappointment.

171
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:58,833
[MASK MAN]
Of course. I'll do my best.

172
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:05,791
Yes, yes. I'm sure you will.
In fact, I'm counting on it.

173
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:07,583
[MASK MAN] These fights
are like the weather.

174
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:09,958
No guarantees.

175
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:12,708
[laughing]

176
00:17:12,791 --> 00:17:14,291
Exactly.

177
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:17,583
It's the unpredictable nature
of this game that attracts me.

178
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:20,041
That, and of course the money.

179
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:21,583
I can't believe your luck.

180
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:23,166
Judging by the competition,

181
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,291
I'd say you've got
this one in the bag.

182
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:26,666
Are you sure about that?

183
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:29,041
This guy's more of a
lounge singer than a warrior.

184
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:30,708
Tell him, Yamcha.

185
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:32,166
Now, I wouldn't go that far,

186
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:34,208
but he definitely
seems a lot less hostile

187
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:35,666
than the bunch
we've been fighting.

188
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,916
But you're forgetting
he is number five,

189
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,500
and I'm sure Baba
saved her best man for last.

190
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:41,583
Do you mind?

191
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:43,625
I'm trying to lift
his spirits here.

192
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:47,333
Oh, what's wrong, Goku?
Are you tired or something?

193
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:51,166
No... It's not that.
It's just...

194
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:57,291
He... He smells good.

195
00:17:57,375 --> 00:18:00,250
Uh, okay...
Well, just don't eat him.

196
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:02,041
I think that's
against the rules.

197
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:03,916
It's strange.

198
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:07,291
I can't explain it...

199
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:09,833
...but somehow...

200
00:18:09,916 --> 00:18:11,750
...it makes me feel comfortable.

201
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:12,791
[UPA]
Huh?

202
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:27,000
How exciting!
I should have sold tickets!

203
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:28,916
[MASK MAN] Excuse me, Baba...

204
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:35,500
[MASK MAN] Actually, there is a
slight problem, a concern.

205
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:36,958
Master Roshi...

206
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:38,333
You've been pretty quiet.

207
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:40,291
Is there something
that's bothering you?

208
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:45,166
Come on, lighten up, Roshi...

209
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:50,166
You saw how strong Goku was a
minute ago--He's invulnerable.

210
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:51,416
No, no...

211
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,750
I wasn't thinking about that.

212
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:57,000
Well then what are you
worried about, Master Roshi?

213
00:18:57,083 --> 00:19:00,541
That masked fighter...
Something's familiar.

214
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:03,625
His voice is like
an echo from the past.

215
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:05,041
[gasp]

216
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:09,458
I can't place it...

217
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:13,250
But I can't shake the feeling
that he's an incredible man.

218
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:15,708
Huh? By incredible
you mean strong?

219
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:16,750
[PUAR gasps]

220
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:19,750
He's a strong one, all right.

221
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:25,625
That's quite evident by my
sister's confidence in him.

222
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:26,791
That scrawny thing

223
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:28,916
doesn't look stronger
than a toothpick.

224
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,833
Huh? You mean to tell me
that's what this is all about?

225
00:19:33,916 --> 00:19:35,500
This is good!

226
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:37,708
[laughing]

227
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:40,041
I love surprises!

228
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:44,458
Pardon! It's time for
your afternoon snack.

229
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:47,916
Snack time already?
I hadn't noticed.

230
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,916
I guess the time really does
fly by when the fights are fun.

231
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,791
Today I have a
special treat for you.

232
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:55,250
A delectable array of
some of your favorite dishes

233
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:57,958
like jellyfish gelatin
and chocolate mouse pie

234
00:19:58,041 --> 00:20:00,291
with a tangy mosquito sauce.

235
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:02,125
Ah! Looks scrumptious!

236
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:04,208
How about a nice cup
of egg-presto?

237
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:06,875
It's my own special blend.

238
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:10,125
Egg-presto, my favorite,
and such a wonderful aroma!

239
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:11,500
What is your secret?

240
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:14,916
Egg whites and
a dash of nutmeg.

241
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,625
Nutmeg, of course.
With a hint of fish scales!

242
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:19,625
This really hits the spot!

243
00:20:23,291 --> 00:20:25,958
Goku has been ready
to fight for a long time,

244
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:29,083
while you're just sitting there
eating and having fun! No fair!

245
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,250
Can we start fighting?

246
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:35,375
[BABA] Certainly, certainly.

247
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:37,333
Anxious to lose?

248
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:41,500
[BABA laughing]

249
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:51,166
Now...

250
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:54,625
Get ready! The last match
is about to begin!

251
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:57,791
It goes on 'til
one of you surrenders.

252
00:20:57,875 --> 00:20:59,500
In the unlikely event

253
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:02,750
that Goku manages to win
this match for his team,

254
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:04,791
I will disclose
to him the location

255
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:06,666
of the final Dragon Ball.

256
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,875
[KRILLIN]
It's all up to you, Goku!

257
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:13,708
[YAMCHA] Yeah. No pressure.

258
00:21:13,791 --> 00:21:16,416
I promise I'll do my best.

259
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:21,000
[MASK MAN] That's all anyone
can ask, or you can offer.

260
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:22,041
[GOKU] What?

261
00:21:26,625 --> 00:21:28,000
Thanks.

262
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:31,500
What's that guy up to?

263
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:34,291
He's Goku's opponent,
but he acts like his friend.

264
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:37,541
Ready... Begin!

265
00:21:57,166 --> 00:21:58,708
If my instincts serve me,

266
00:21:58,791 --> 00:22:01,166
this is going to be
an interesting fight.

267
00:22:02,375 --> 00:22:04,833
[GOKU thinking] This one is
nothing like the others...

268
00:22:04,916 --> 00:22:06,791
But is that good or bad?

269
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:09,875
[MASK MAN] When you're ready.

270
00:22:26,625 --> 00:22:28,791
[NARRATOR] As Goku's
friends watch the battle,

271
00:22:28,875 --> 00:22:31,000
several questions
burn in their minds:

272
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:34,541
Can the young hero defeat
his mysterious opponent?

273
00:22:34,625 --> 00:22:36,000
Why does this masked man

274
00:22:36,083 --> 00:22:39,958
seem so familiar to both
Goku and Master Roshi?

275
00:22:40,041 --> 00:22:43,583
This is the final match in
Fortuneteller Baba's tournament.

276
00:22:43,666 --> 00:22:45,458
Who will emerge victorious?

277
00:22:45,541 --> 00:22:49,833
Find out in the next exciting
episode of Dragon Ball!
