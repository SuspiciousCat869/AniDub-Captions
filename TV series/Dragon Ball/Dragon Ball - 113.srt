[NARRATOR]
Previously on Dragon Ball,

2
00:02:13,583 --> 00:02:16,458
after a near fatal battle
with King Piccolo,

3
00:02:16,541 --> 00:02:19,416
Goku retreated to
Korin's Tower to recuperate,

4
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,250
meeting some old
friends along the way.

5
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:25,041
Master Roshi attempted
to trap King Piccolo using

6
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:27,125
the Evil Containment Wave,

7
00:02:27,208 --> 00:02:28,583
but was defeated.

8
00:02:28,666 --> 00:02:32,083
King Piccolo realized his
dastardly ambition for power

9
00:02:32,166 --> 00:02:35,750
by calling upon the Eternal
Dragon and wishing for youth.

10
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:37,541
[DRAGON]
As you wish.

11
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:41,416
[NARRATOR] Unfortunately for
all, his desire was granted.

12
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:45,375
Restored, the new King Piccolo
wasted no time implementing

13
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:47,541
his scheme of world domination.

14
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:51,000
He vowed to wreak
havoc across the globe.

15
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:29,625
[PIANO] Presently the world
is divided into 43 sectors.

16
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:32,791
Each sector is ruled by a king.

17
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:35,166
We are currently approaching
the Eastern City,

18
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:36,750
home of King Furry.

19
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:39,375
This is his sector,
as is the surrounding area,

20
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:43,000
also the north area,
which is covered with snow.

21
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:45,291
There's also a desert
and furthermore--

22
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:46,750
[PICCOLO]
Enough!

23
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:47,458
Eh?

24
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:49,375
Such a boring locale.

25
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:53,833
Let me show you something fun.

[PIANO] Hm? We've arrived
at King's Castle.

32
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:30,416
Then, let's go. It's time
to take our first step

33
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,291
in creating a new world order.

34
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:42,000
[PICCOLO]
Huh?

35
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:46,708
I forgot to mention, sire,

36
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:48,583
today the town's
citizens are celebrating

37
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:50,625
their King's 20th term.

38
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:52,833
Good.

39
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:55,125
[PIANO] Or perhaps they knew
we were coming and decided

40
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:57,333
to start celebrating
your ascension early.

00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:19,291
[PARADE MC]
Welcome, everyone!

46
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:20,916
Allow me to extend a big hello

47
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,875
from the citizens
of Eastern City

48
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:25,708
to everyone around the
world watching us today.

49
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:27,708
We're gathered here
for an amazing parade

50
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:30,583
commemorating King Furry's
20th term in office.

51
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:33,208
What makes this king so loved
and revered by his subjects

52
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,250
is his stellar political record,

53
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:39,291
highlighted by a dogged pursuit
of world prosperity and peace.

54
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:55,333
Oh, here he comes now!

55
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:59,458
You see him? Ah!
I can't believe it!

enjoy themselves while they can.

Do I look stronger?

64
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:48,916
Since you left, I've been taking
combat lessons from my father.

65
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I'm gonna be a great

You are looking ill.
Is it serious? What's wrong?

He nearly got himself killed...

[BORA, UPA gasp]

74
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:16,458
...by a terrible monster
named King Piccolo.

75
00:07:16,541 --> 00:07:19,875
Goku decided to try and
fight him all by himself.

76
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:22,083
It was a dumb thing to do.

77
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:24,208
Hey! I don't know who you are,

78
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:26,625
but you'd better stop
talking that way about Goku,

79
00:07:26,708 --> 00:07:28,208
or you'll be sorry!

80
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:30,666

Yajirobe is telling
the truth. I was beaten.

85
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:42,541
But no one can hurt you, Goku!

86
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:44,541
It is difficult to believe.

87
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:46,125
I came back

88
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:48,958
to see if Master Korin could
help improve my strength

89
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:50,750
like he did before.

You're going to
climb the tower!?

rest here a few days?

with that wound.

Uh--! Are you nuts!?

You're strong enough
to climb Korin's Tower.

Well, I appreciate
the vote of confidence,

but why do I have to do it?!

He's right, Goku! You don't
wanna rely on a guy like him!

I don't wanna get involved
in anything dangerous.

I didn't come here for trouble.

108
00:08:57,625 --> 00:09:00,875
I came here for food,
and since I'm obviously

not going to get any,

110
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:03,541

to stand around here

No. That's not an option.
