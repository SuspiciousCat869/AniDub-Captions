1
00:02:11,416 --> 00:02:12,625
Run.

2
00:02:12,708 --> 00:02:13,875
[chuckles]

3
00:02:13,958 --> 00:02:15,958
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball...

4
00:02:16,041 --> 00:02:19,541
Goku found himself in hot
pursuit of a bionic bird

5
00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:21,916
stuffed with
Emperor Pilaf and his crew.

6
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,291
Pilaf was well equipped for
battle this time

7
00:02:24,375 --> 00:02:27,500
with his brand new
transforming Power Suits.

8
00:02:27,583 --> 00:02:28,916
As Goku neared,

9
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,083
Pilaf provided a demonstration
of his deadly invention!

10
00:02:32,166 --> 00:02:35,750
But fortune changed hands as
Goku returned the projectile

11
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:37,833
to its rightful owner

12
00:02:37,916 --> 00:02:41,208
[GOKU] Can I please have your
Dragon Ball now, mister?

13
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:43,166
Take it...

14
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:45,750
Please take it...

15
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:48,041
[laughs]

16
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:49,958
One more thing...

17
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:51,208
Huh?

18
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:53,583
[NARRATOR] So with a quick
costume change,

19
00:02:53,666 --> 00:02:57,208
Goku was off to Baba's house
with the last Dragon Ball!

20
00:02:57,291 --> 00:03:00,500
Upa has an important wish
for the Eternal Dragon!

21
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:14,666
I got it!

22
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,708
[GOKU laughs]

23
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:26,375
[GOKU thinking]
I can't wait to tell Upa!

24
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:33,541
[laughs]

25
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:37,208
[GOKU] Hey, I got it!
I got the last ball!

26
00:03:38,625 --> 00:03:40,958
Look, you guys!
Goku's finally back!

27
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:42,833
[gasping]

28
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:47,583
It seems his trip
was successful!

29
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:51,583
[UPA] Is that really it?

30
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:53,166
The last ball?

31
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,833
So you did find it!

32
00:03:54,916 --> 00:03:55,666
That's right!

33
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,041
[chuckles]

34
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:59,291
What happened to the clothes
you were wearing before?

35
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:01,500
[laughs]

36
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:03,458
[YAMCHA] Hey, uh,
tell us about your trip!

37
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:05,583
Who was in the car?

38
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:07,500
I'll tell you about it later.

39
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:08,708
Ready?

40
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:09,958
You bet!

41
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,625
Now that we've got all of
the Dragon Balls,

42
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:13,666
it's time to go get
your Dad back!

43
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:14,666
[UPA] Uh-huh!

44
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:17,041
[BOTH laugh]

45
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:18,250
Sorry, Nimbus.

46
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:21,000
We don't have time
to rest just yet!

47
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,125
Come on up and hold on tight.
This thing goes pretty fast!

48
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:31,208
The faster, the better!

49
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:36,416
Okay, I'll be back as
soon as we get Bora home

50
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,750
where he belongs!

51
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:40,833
Thank you!
I'll never forget you guys!

52
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:42,291
We'll miss you!

53
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:44,500
Now you mind your father, boy.

54
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,416
I won't ever disobey him again.

55
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,416
[PUAR sniffles]

56
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,541
Let's go.

57
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,041
[sniffs]

58
00:04:56,541 --> 00:04:57,625
Okay!

59
00:04:57,708 --> 00:04:59,083
Hmm...

60
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:03,166
[GOKU] See ya soon!

61
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:12,333
That boy should learn
the art of taking a break!

62
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:16,500
It's so unfair; I wanted to
see the Eternal Dragon, too.

63
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:18,125
I always said
he was a tough kid,

64
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:20,166
but I still can't believe
he actually got

65
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:21,791
all seven Dragon Balls!

66
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:23,833
He certainly is amazing.

67
00:05:23,916 --> 00:05:26,958
And the entire world will know
his name someday...

68
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:29,666
Huh? Now what is that
supposed to mean?

69
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,750
What do you know, Baba?

70
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:33,625
Just a feeling.

71
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:37,166
I sense that he'll be
a great hero of his time.

72
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:38,750
Whoa...

73
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:40,708
I thought he already was...

74
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:47,500
[UPA thinking]
Goku really did it!

75
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:49,458
It won't be long now, Father!

76
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:58,916
[BULMA hums]

77
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,666
So how far
can you spit, then?

78
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:01,208
Bwah!

79
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:02,375
[ROSHI chuckles]

80
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:03,541
[ROSHI] I've hit
a mosquito with a spitball

81
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:04,458
right in his eye!

82
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:05,791
[BOTH laugh]

83
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:06,958
[ROSHI] Hmm...?

84
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:08,875
Huh?

85
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:11,166
Excuse me, Master Roshi?

86
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:14,500
Hey, Yamcha,
why such a long face?

87
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:16,875
I've been thinking
a lot, and, uh...

88
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:19,750
I was wondering if you could
take me on as a student.

89
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:21,625
[BULMA] Hm?!

90
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:24,041
[YAMCHA] I think living in
the city is making me soft,

91
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:26,291
and I see what a good job
you did with Goku...

92
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:28,708
So, uh, what d'ya say?

93
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:30,625
Yamcha?

94
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:32,458
[ROSHI] Mm-mm. No way...

95
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:35,333
I'm sorry son, but
two students is my limit...

96
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:37,541
I'm an old man,
I can't handle any more.

97
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:41,791
Come on! I won't be
any trouble, I promise!

98
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:46,125
It's too much work...

99
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:48,166
[BULMA growls]

100
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:51,708
I don't see why you
can't just give him a chance!

101
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:54,958
You're nothing but a lazy,
selfish, mean old grouch!

102
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:58,958
[ROSHI] I'm not lazy... I
happen to have things to do!

103
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:01,250
If you let Yamcha
come train with you,

104
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:03,041
maybe I'll come visit, too.

105
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:04,333
[ROSHI gasps]

106
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:05,916
Your place is by the water,

107
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,291
and I have this new bikini
I'm dying to try out.

108
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:13,375
Well... When can you start?

109
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:15,458
[groaning]

00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:21,416
Um... Goku?

111
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,500
What is it?

112
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:25,083
Is... this really...
going to work?

113
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:28,125
Don't worry so much.
Everything will work out.

114
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:30,500
You can trust
the Eternal Dragon.

I... didn't know
it'd be this big!

174
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:49,791
That thing's gonna
bring my Dad back?

00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:27,875
[ETERNAL DRAGON] Why have you
disturbed my slumber?

179

Oh! He seems mad...

Hey... tell him.

Tell him your wish!

But... but...

I'll tell him.

[ETERNAL DRAGON growls]

Help me, please.

194
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:23,250
Will you bring my father
back to life for me?

195
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:25,583
I really miss him a lot...

00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:33,750
[GOKU] So... can you do it?

199
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:39,000
Yes, I can.
Your wish is granted.

200
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:40,208
[GOKU] See?

201
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:41,916
I told you there was
nothing to worry about.

202
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,708
He just seems a little scary!

You're really back!

I missed you!
I love you so much!

[laughs]

217
00:14:49,416 --> 00:14:51,250
I can't believe
you're finally home!

218
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:52,916
I thought I'd never
see you again!

219
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,250
But here you are! Alive!

220
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:56,708
Huh...?

221
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:03,791
[UPA sobs]

[UPA laughs]

224
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:18,166
I see... I think I remember...

225
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:22,166
Yes, Father...

226
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:26,250
You were dead, but Goku got the
big dragon to bring you back!

227
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:29,416
Then I owe great thanks to you.

228
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:34,250
Your wish has been fulfilled.
I will take my leave.

229
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:50,083
Now where is number four?

230
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:55,000
There it is.

231
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:00,250
[grunts]

232
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:05,625
[chuckles]

233
00:16:05,708 --> 00:16:09,291
[UPA] Goku, are you okay?
Why did you do that?

234
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:11,250
I knew the Dragon Balls
would get scattered

235
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:14,125
all over the world right
after the wish was made.

236
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:17,666
I had to get Grandpa's Four-Star
Ball before I lost it.

237
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,166
--But look at it!
--Huh?

238
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:21,208
What happened?

239
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:22,583
After the Dragon appears,

240
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:25,250
the balls become regular
stones for one whole year.

241
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:29,000
That way no one can find them
and the Dragon can rest.

242
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:30,458
Ohh!

243
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:34,708
Goku, I do not know
how to thank you!

244
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:36,625
You just did, silly!

245
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:39,375
Someday, I will find a
way to repay you.

246
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:41,833
If you ever need help,
please come find me.

247
00:16:41,916 --> 00:16:44,583
Father, Goku made it to
the top of Korin Tower.

248
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:47,541
Not only that, he beat that
bad man who hurt you, too!

249
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:52,500
Ahh! You are a gift
from the stars, young man.

250
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:53,833
I better go.

251
00:16:53,916 --> 00:16:56,708
What? You're going already?

252
00:16:56,791 --> 00:16:58,625
Are you sure
you don't want to stay?

253
00:16:58,708 --> 00:17:00,083
I'll prepare a feast.

254
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:02,416
Thanks, but my friends
are waiting for me.

255
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,333
Okay.

256
00:17:03,416 --> 00:17:04,708
See ya later, alright?

257
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:05,583

Farewell, my friend!
Be careful!

--Bye!
--[GOKU chuckles]

266
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:36,208
[BORA] Son, are you
going to grow up

267
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:38,416
as strong as Goku someday?

268
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,500
Yeah!

269
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,500
Father?

270
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:41,791
Yes?

271
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:45,083
I'm gonna climb Korin Tower
just like he did.

272
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:46,875
If I work as hard as he does...

273
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:48,791
and practice climbing
every day...

274
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:50,833
then someday I will
make it to the top!

275
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:52,333
I'm sure of it!

276
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,250
Whu... Who-Whoa!

277

He's back! Look, it's Goku!

[GOKU] Hello!

280
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:40,000
What's up? Did the
Eternal Dragon help Upa's dad?

281
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:41,458
Oh yeah, it was a piece of cake!

Yay! Good job!

283
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:45,416
I bet they were really
happy to see each other!

284
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,500
Yeah!

285
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:48,208
You did good, kid.

00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:52,375
I gotta go!

289
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:55,541
That was a long trip!
Oh, hurry, hurry!

290
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:57,958
No! You can't do that here!
Go find a bush, you animal!

--[yelling continues]
--And he's going to famous?

292
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:00,541
[BABA] Think about the
poor creatures...

293
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:02,166
Well...

294
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:04,291
Oh, boy, what a relief!

295
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:05,541
After all this time,

296
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:07,708
you finally collected
all the Dragon Balls!

297
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:09,833
It's a tough break that
you have to wait a whole year

298
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:12,250
before you can find your
Grandpa's keepsake again,

299
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:13,458
isn't it?

300
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:15,666
Wait. [grunts]

301
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,291
No, I caught the Four-Star Ball

302
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:19,250
before it had a
chance to fly off!

303
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:21,583
That must have been
one nice catch!

304
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:23,375
[KRILLIN] Does this mean
you won't be looking

305
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:25,416
for the Dragon Balls any more?

306
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,333
That's right!

307
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:27,541
I think I'll start training

308
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:30,083
for the next martial arts
tournament now!

309
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:31,750
That reminds me--guess what?

310
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:35,083
I'm training, too! With you
guys, under Master Roshi!

311
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:37,166
He agreed to take me
as his student!

312
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:38,750
We'll have so much fun!

313
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:40,833
Yeah, I want a complete
training refresher,

314
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:42,208
right from the beginning!

315
00:19:42,291 --> 00:19:43,833
I guess that's okay...

316
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:45,708
Just don't pick up
any of his bad habits.

317
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:47,291
Goku doesn't--oh wait.

318
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:49,250
You're talking about me,
aren't you?

319
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:52,708
[GOKU] That's great! Master,
we can train together, right?

320
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:53,875
[ROSHI] That's a bad idea.

321
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:55,083
Huh?

322
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:56,958
You're already
exceptionally well trained.

323
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:59,000
Don't you want to try
to grow stronger now?

324
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:02,750
Sure, of course I want
to get stronger, Master.

325
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:04,958
Then I can be of no more
use to you, son.

326
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:07,416
You've officially
outgrown my teachings.

327
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,875
It's time for you to set
out on your own,

328
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:12,791
and learn from the
adventure of life!

329
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:15,208
There are many things to be seen
in this vast world,

330
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:18,291
and they can only be truly
experienced in person!

331
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:20,791
Go wander, my boy,
and keep your eyes peeled.

332
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:23,916
There are endless opportunities
out there for you!

333
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,375
[thinking] I'm so good,
I suprise myself sometimes...

334
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:30,791
You lost me. Can you start over?

335
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:32,875
[ROSHI gasps]

336
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:34,833
--[KRILLIN chuckles]
--I mean, go travel!

337
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:35,958
[KRILLIN laughs]

338
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:37,583
If you say so!

339
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:38,958
Right.

340
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:40,541
We'll plan to meet up at the
next world tournament.

341
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:42,333
We definitely won't miss that.

342
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:43,791
Wait!

343
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:46,458
You're saying we won't see
Goku again for five years?!

344
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:47,875
No, in three years!

345
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:49,958
The tournament has added
so many participants

346
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:52,833
that they're holding it
every three years from now on.

347
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:54,208
It's a deal!

348
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:57,208
I promise I'll meet you guys
at the tournament gates!

349
00:20:57,291 --> 00:20:58,708
That's so long...

350
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:01,208
Couldn't we have a reunion
sometime before the tournament?

351
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:03,208
Don't worry. The time will fly!

352
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:05,375
I'll be so much stronger
in the ring next time

353
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:07,208
that you won't even
recognize me!

354
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:09,583
[GOKU] Listen to Master Roshi,
and you're sure to get better!

355
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:11,250
Promise us you'll
be careful out there!

356
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:12,333
[GOKU] Mmkay!

357
00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:13,583
Do you think three years
is enough time

358
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:15,083
--for you to get happy?
--[BULMA growls]

359
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:17,625
What're you trying to say?!

360
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:18,958
Know what?

361
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:20,916
I'll be a lot taller
by the time I see you again!

362
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,333
Maybe even taller than you!

363
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:23,666
[GOKU laughs]

364
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,958
I wouldn't count on that.
I'll grow too, you know?

365
00:21:27,958 --> 00:21:30,041
I guess I'll be on my way now.

366
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:31,833
Bye, Master Roshi; Bye, Baba.

367
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:32,958
Take care, kid.

368
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:35,208
I hope you learn a lot
on this journey!

369
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:39,250
--Nim--
--No cloud! Just feet.

370
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:40,416
You won't get any stronger

371
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,541
if you rely on help
outside yourself!

372
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:45,958
Walk, run, swim--Do whatever it
takes to get around on your own!

373
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:47,166
What?!

374
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:49,083
I'm supposed to travel
the world on foot?!

375
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:49,875
[ALL gasping]

376
00:21:49,958 --> 00:21:51,208
That's pretty harsh!

377
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:55,000
What sort of mess have
I gotten myself into here?

378
00:21:55,083 --> 00:21:56,750
[whimpers]

379
00:21:56,833 --> 00:21:57,500
Hmm...

380
00:21:57,583 --> 00:21:59,458
That's okay!

381
00:21:59,541 --> 00:22:00,916
See ya!

382
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,958
[GOKU laughs]

383
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:05,583
He's... just as crazy as ever...

384
00:22:05,666 --> 00:22:09,291
I don't think he even
knows what pain is!

385
00:22:09,375 --> 00:22:11,083
[KRILLIN] I wonder how
much stronger he'll be

386
00:22:11,166 --> 00:22:12,625
after three years of this?

387
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:14,291
[ROSHI] There's
no use in guessing

388
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:16,875
when it comes to
a kid like Goku!

389
00:22:16,958 --> 00:22:18,750
How about for kicks you
give them a taste

390
00:22:18,833 --> 00:22:20,458
of what it's like to be Goku?

391
00:22:20,541 --> 00:22:21,583
[ROSHI giggles]

392
00:22:21,666 --> 00:22:22,958
[ROSHI] Okay! We've
had enough R &amp; R!

393
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:24,958
Let's race all the way home!
Loser washes my socks!

394
00:22:25,041 --> 00:22:26,416
[ALL scream]

395
00:22:29,166 --> 00:22:30,458
[BULMA] Hey!
I'm not your student!

396
00:22:30,541 --> 00:22:32,833
I shouldn't have to
be doing this!

397
00:22:32,916 --> 00:22:35,666
[GOKU] One... two...
one... two...

398
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:37,166
[chanting continues]

399
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:39,541
[NARRATOR] With the Dragon Balls
scattered across the land,

400
00:22:39,625 --> 00:22:41,583
and Upa reunited
with his father,

401
00:22:41,666 --> 00:22:44,291
it's time for Goku
to go back to his training.

402
00:22:44,375 --> 00:22:45,708
It's only three short years

403
00:22:45,791 --> 00:22:47,833
until the next World
Martial Arts Tournament.

404
00:22:47,916 --> 00:22:51,083
Can Goku improve his skills
without Master Roshi?

405
00:22:51,166 --> 00:22:55,375
Find out as the saga continues,
next time on Dragon Ball!
