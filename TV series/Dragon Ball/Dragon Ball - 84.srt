1
00:02:17,166 --> 00:02:20,583
[NARRATOR] The high seas,
wondrous and enchanting--

2
00:02:20,666 --> 00:02:23,375
Their blue waters filled
with untold treasures

3
00:02:23,458 --> 00:02:27,875
and numerous forms of life,
both familiar and mysterious.

4
00:02:32,916 --> 00:02:37,041
[NARRATOR] Today, the waters are
calm and peaceful... until...

5
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:45,541
[CAPTAIN]
Something's headed right for us!

6
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,000
It's closing in! Fast!

7
00:02:58,375 --> 00:03:00,458
Hard to starboard. Move!

8
00:03:00,541 --> 00:03:02,875
[SAILOR]
Aye, Captain! Hard to starboard.

9
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:23,958
Hey, kid! Are you okay?

10
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:27,416
What are you doing
in the water?!

11
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,958
Hi!

12
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:30,750
Will you please point me in
the direction of Papaya Island?

13
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:32,708
I seem to have gotten lost.

14
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:36,916
Thank you!

15
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:47,208
Hey... Was that a mermaid?

16
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:03,333
[PILOT] Attention, passengers.

17
00:04:03,416 --> 00:04:05,416
We have encountered
some mild turbulence.

18
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,416
For those drinking coffee
or applying makeup,

19
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,958
we do apologize.

20
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:11,875
In just a few moments, we will
be landing on Papaya Island,

21
00:04:11,958 --> 00:04:13,791
home of the World
Martial Arts Tournament.

22
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:16,458
At this time, we ask that
you remain in your seats

23
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:19,250
and make sure your lap belts
are securely fastened.

24
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:25,958
We're finally here.
This is exciting.

25
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:27,333
It sure is,

26
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:29,208
especially since you're
going to win the tournament.

27
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:31,083
Yamcha could be the
champion of the tournament

28
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:32,666
if I let him win.

29
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,000
Yeah, sure.

30
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:35,208
And just to keep things fair,
when we do fight,

31
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:37,500
I'll tie my hands
and keep my eyes closed.

32
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:39,583
Um, not to put
a damper on this,

33
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:41,541
but aren't you boys
forgetting something?

34
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:44,333
Or should I say someone,
namely Goku?

35
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:47,458
Goku, Shmoeku.
My money's on Jackie Chun!

36
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:49,458
He did win last time,
after all...

37
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:53,083
I hate Chun! He's the one who
beat Goku! Let's kill him!

38
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:55,500
It's okay, Launch. Settle down.

39
00:04:58,041 --> 00:04:59,000
Help...

40
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:05,416
Sir? Are you all right?
Is something the matter?

41
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,291
I want off
this plane right now!

42
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:10,166
I see.

43
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:12,083
Land or get me a parachute.

44
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:14,083
Either way, I'm leaving!

45
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:20,500
Sir...

46
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:22,125
I'm sorry,
but it's impossible

47
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:24,291
for anyone to leave
the plane before it lands.

48
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:25,916
Please sit back
and try to relax.

49
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Can I get you a pillow
or some peanuts?

50
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:30,916
I don't want peanuts.
I want this bird on the ground!

51
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,500
Now go tell the captain!

52
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:33,833
Yes, sir.

53
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:36,125
[OOLONG] I'll take some peanuts.

54
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:40,541
[growling]

55
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:42,750
Master, please
get control of yourself.

56
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:45,041
This is embarrassing.

57
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:47,750
[YAMCHA] From now on,
I'm travelling alone.

58
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:09,708
Time to eat. I'm starving!

59
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:17,083
Fruit!

60
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:20,500
Perfect!

61
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:22,250
[TIGERS growling]

62
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,083
Oh, look at the tigers!

63
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:27,416
They must be hungry, too...

64
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,458
Here!

65
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:33,083
Eat!

66
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:34,958
Go on, there's plenty more
where those came from!

67
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:36,375
Uh oh!

68
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:40,583
What's wrong, kitties?

69
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:45,250
These are tasty!

70
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:49,583
[roaring]

71
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:53,625
What's wrong?

72
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:55,083
[GOKU yelling]

73
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:59,041
[GOKU yelling]

74
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:11,458
Great!

75
00:07:11,541 --> 00:07:12,750
Roshi couldn't wait
to leave the plane,

76
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:14,791
but now we can't get him
out of the airport!

77
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:16,000
If he doesn't hurry,

78
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:18,500
we'll miss our check-in
for the Tournament.

79
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:21,375
Hey! Wait up!

80
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:22,625
You won't believe what I found

81
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:25,500
crawling in the
airport's commissary.

82
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:28,750
I just have one question.
Why me?

83
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:33,166
[KRILLIN]
Hey, front door service!

84
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:35,916
[TURTLE]
That's a matter of perspective.

85
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,750
[YAMCHA] Need a lift?

86
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:38,583
There.

87
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,833
Thank you, Yamcha.

88
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:43,416
[BULMA] I hope I don't
run into anyone I know.

89
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:48,750
[ROSHI] All in all,
that was a nice flight.

90
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:51,125
[KRILLIN] The competition hall,
please, and make it snappy.

91
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:52,500
[DRIVER] Yes, sir.

92
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:14,416
Finally!
It feels great to be back.

93
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,458
It's like I never left.

94
00:08:16,541 --> 00:08:17,625
Yeah.

95
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:27,708
Are you boys
going to sign up?

96
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:29,333
[KRILLIN] Oh, yes, sir!

97
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:32,125
[RECEPTIONIST]
Thank you, Yamcha...

98
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:33,541
...and... Krillin.

99
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:34,750
[ROSHI] I'm just curious.

100
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:37,750
Has a boy named
Goku registered yet?

101
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:39,333
Goku...

102
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:42,458
Oh yes, that young boy who won
the vice-championship last time.

103
00:08:42,541 --> 00:08:45,666
No. According to
my records, he hasn't.

104
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,500
That's strange.

105
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:50,458
Where could he be?
What's holding him up?

106
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:51,666
He'd better hurry.

107
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:54,291
If he's not careful,
he'll miss the entries.

108
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:59,250
It's not like him
to be late...

109
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:01,958
I sure hope he didn't
forget what day it is.

110
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:21,916
Entry time is just about up.

111
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:25,458
Don't worry. He'll be here.

112
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:27,791
He was really looking
forward to the competition.

113
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:31,000
He'll wait to show up at
the last minute, just watch.

114
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:33,166
I don't see what
all this fuss is about.

115
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,666
Fighting with rules. How boring.

116
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,750
If anyone else
but you had said that,

117
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:40,166
I would have thought
they were bragging.

118
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:43,791
Sweet sauerkraut!
I almost forgot to sign up!

119
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:50,708
Waugh!

120
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:53,333
Say, there's a name I'd
like to enter in the tournament.

121
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:55,083
Jackie Chun.

122
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:57,666
Jackie Chun?
You don't mean the Jackie Chun

123
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:00,750
who won the championship
at the last competition?

124
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:02,750
Mmm-hmm!

125
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:04,583
I don't believe it! You're him?

126
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:06,500
Shh!

127
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:13,250
See?

128
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:16,166
I-I see.

129
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:19,750
Let's keep this little secret
just between you and me.

130
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:20,958
Sure!

131
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:25,708
Jackie Chun is on the list.

132
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:28,583
Oh, there's only
five minutes left.

133
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:30,458
He's not going to make it.

134
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:36,208
Master...

135
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:38,875
Goku is going to make it
in time, isn't he?

136
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:41,833
Just keep your eye on that road.
He'll be here.

137
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:43,583
Uh, hey, you were
chatting with that clerk

138
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:45,666
like you were best friends.

139
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,458
That's none of your business!

140
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,125
[CRANE] Hello.

141
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:03,250
Nice to see you've come out
of your shell, Master Roshi.

142
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:32,375
Hermit Crane, what a surprise.

143
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:35,541
After all these years,
you're still alive.

144
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:38,833
The lines on your face
are just as deep, old friend.

145
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:42,166
That was rude.

146
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:44,458
Relax. I didn't come
here to start trouble.

147
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:46,125
In fact, I heard
a silly little whisper

148
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:49,000
that your pupils did quite well
during the last tournament.

149
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:52,125
I guess the saying is true,
anything can happen.

150
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:54,541
What's it to you, huh?!

151
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:56,583
You're out of your league,
Roshi, admit it.

152
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:58,666
You were privileged
by my absence last time,

153
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,500
but we both know
fighting against my team

154
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:02,416
is an exercise in futility.

155
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,458
Not even Jackie Chun
could handle my boys!

156
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:07,625
Do yourself a favor and go home.

157
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:20,541
[chuckling]

158
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:23,875
I sympathize with your crew.
I really, really do.

159
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:26,791
Inadequacy is always such
a tough pill to swallow,

160
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:29,708
but it sure beats
public humiliation.

161
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:30,958
Thanks for the concern.

162
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,958
It's nice to see some
things haven't changed.

163
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:35,958
Like you're still
full of hot air.

164
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:37,833
You'd better stay out of my way!

165
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:40,458
We're not turning
tail for you or anyone!

166
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:55,375
You've been warned.

167
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:57,750
Now suffer the consequences.
Let's go!

168
00:12:57,833 --> 00:13:00,375
I've wasted enough
time on these fools!

169
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:20,083
Master Roshi,
who was that weirdo?

170
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:23,083
His name's Master Shen,
but I used to call him friend.

171
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:26,375
Time's almost up!
We have one minute left.

172
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:28,750
He's late!

173
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:29,833
Relax.

174
00:13:29,916 --> 00:13:32,000
Puar, I want you
to transform into Goku

175
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:33,583
and register as him.

176
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:34,625
Right!

177
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:39,791
Wait! Look, here he is!

178
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:44,416
Hello, everybody!
Wait up! I'm coming!

179
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,333
Hey, Goku!

180
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:51,375
Long time no see!

181
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:55,458
You got here just in time! Cool!

182
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:58,291
I know. What have
you guys been doing?

183
00:13:58,375 --> 00:13:59,375
Waiting.

184
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:03,875
[ALL laughing]

185
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:05,625
That was a good one!

186
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:08,083
Goku is here.
Is he in time to register?

187
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:09,291
Yes, of course.

188
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:10,791
[ROSHI] Thank you.

189
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:12,500
What have you
gotten yourself into now?

190
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:14,166
You look filthy!

191
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:16,500
It's good to
see you again, Bulma.

192
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:19,708
Are my eyes deceiving me,

193
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:22,416
or have you gotten taller
since the last time I saw you?

194
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,125
Oh, yeah!

195
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:28,208
[KRILLIN thinking] So he's grown
a few inches. Big deal.

196
00:14:28,291 --> 00:14:30,291
Most of it's hair anyway!

197
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:32,208
Yo, Goku!

198
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:36,208
You look awfully winded
for someone who rides a cloud.

199
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:38,458
Where is the Nimbus
and why were you late?

200
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:41,125
Master, I thought you
said not to bring the Nimbus.

201
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:43,166
You said I should
rely on my own strength.

202
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:45,666
Right... I did say that.

203
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,208
I have one question.

204
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:49,166
Did you swim here?

205
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:52,666
Yeah, part of the way.
From a place called Yahhoi.

206
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,000
From Yahhoi?!

207
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:55,500
That's impossible.

208
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:57,666
It's on the other side
of the Earth!

209
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:01,291
The scary thing here
is that I believe you.

210
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,375
What? Uh... Huh?

211
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:09,166
The important thing is
you're here and registered.

212
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:11,875
Now what do ya say we
go grab a bite to eat?!

213
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:13,250
Food!

214
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:15,541
It's customary to
feast before a big fight,

215
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:17,041
and since they
don't come any bigger

216
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:18,833
than the World
Martial Arts Tournament,

217
00:15:18,916 --> 00:15:22,250
we should dine on the best
meal this town has to offer!

218
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:24,208
[ALL] Yeah!

219
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:26,166
Good idea!

220
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:28,458
I'm going to eat
until I bust!

221
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:37,916
[ROSHI] How about I just
make us all some sandwiches?

222
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,000
[chattering]

223
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:47,041
[stammering nervously]

224
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:16,208
--I couldn't eat another bite.
--What'd you think of dessert?

225
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:17,916
Weren't they delicious?

226
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:23,291
What? What do you mean
you can't pay the bill?

227
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:24,833
Shh!

228
00:16:24,916 --> 00:16:26,541
[ROSHI] Not so loud.

229
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:27,791
Listen, I know
what you're thinking,

230
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:29,208
but I can pay my bill.

231
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:31,000
It's just going to
take a couple of days.

232
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:33,708
By then I should
have 500,000 Zeni.

233
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:36,291
I'm telling you the truth!

234
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:38,083
I believe you, sir!

235
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:41,166
[GOKU] Krillin, was
training with Master Roshi

236
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,291
as challenging
as it was last time?

237
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:44,500
Definitely.

238
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:46,291
If you remember the
program we did together,

239
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:48,291
multiply that by a hundred.

240
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:50,500
When I wasn't farming
and delivering milk,

241
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:52,833
I was lugging around
a hundred pound stones!

242
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:56,083
A hundred pound stones?
That does sound challenging!

243
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:00,666
[ROSHI laughing awkwardly]

244
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,291
You don't look well.
What's the matter?

245
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:04,250
Was there a problem
with the manager?

246
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:05,708
How many times
do I have to tell you

247
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:08,250
to be quiet and
mind your own business?

248
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:12,458
[laughing awkwardly]

249
00:17:12,541 --> 00:17:13,625
I don't know what came over me.

250
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:15,375
Must have been
something in the soup.

251
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:16,750
Hey, I've got a good idea.

252
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:18,541
Why don't we all
go back to the hotel

253
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:20,875
and play a nice game of cards?

254
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:33,708
--[BULMA] Oh no!
--[PUAR] Bulma got a Joker!

[YAMCHA] Oolong, pick a card.

257
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,416
What is this?

258
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,333
It's the Joker.

259
00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:45,875
All right, choose a card.

260
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:49,166
Second from the left.

261
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,458
Good choice.

00:17:50,541 --> 00:17:51,916

[ROSHI] Pick one!

00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:08,250
Which one should I choose?

271
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:09,875
Just pick one up!

272
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:11,916
I think I'll take this one...

273
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,291

Oh, silly me.
This isn't my room.

Since I'm here,
I might as well give you

284
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:50,958
these extra blankets
in case you get cold.

[KRILLIN] Yamcha!

Who could sleep
with all that racket?

291
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:58,041
At least we can get a
jump-start on the competition.

292
00:19:58,125 --> 00:19:59,083
Yep.

293
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:04,958
Huh?

294
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:35,166
Hey, aren't those
the guys who held

295
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:37,541
the top 3 spots in
the last competition?

296
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:40,416
That's them, all right.
Just my bad luck.

297
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:43,041
[KRILLIN] I don't
remember our competitors

298
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:45,500
being this big last time.

299
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:47,041
It feels great
to be back in red.

300
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:49,208
I've missed this outfit.

301

Just between us,

302
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:52,166
how much stronger
do you think Goku's gotten

303
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,666
in these last three years?

304
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,083
Uh...

305
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:58,291
I'd say he's somewhere
between tough and invincible.

go in there and
show them how it's done.

Huh? He was right here
a second ago.

318
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:30,750
Knowing him,
I'm sure he's trying

319
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:32,791
to find a way
to get into the hall.

320

Oh my gosh! It's Jackie Chun!

They're selling autographed
postcards in the lobby.

Hello?

325
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:55,458

to see you again.

326
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:56,708
How are you?

327
00:21:56,791 --> 00:21:58,708
Great! Are you here to fight?

328
00:21:58,791 --> 00:22:00,791
Unless they tell me otherwise.

329
00:22:00,875 --> 00:22:02,125
I sure hope so, sir.

330
00:22:02,208 --> 00:22:04,000
I've been
training for a rematch.

331
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:04,958
[chuckling]

332
00:22:05,041 --> 00:22:06,083
I'll bet you have!

333
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:08,000
You've got a fire
in that belly, kid.

334
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:09,416
Don't ever lose that.

335
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,000
[ROSHI thinking]
As Master Roshi,

336
00:22:11,083 --> 00:22:13,166
I could never get an accurate
measure of your true strength,

337
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:14,500
but as Jackie Chun,

338
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:17,125
I know you'll give me
everything you've got.

339
00:22:18,166 --> 00:22:19,291
Good evening and welcome

340
00:22:19,375 --> 00:22:22,250
to the 22nd World
Martial Arts Tournament!

341
00:22:22,333 --> 00:22:25,875
It is my privilege and honor to
preside over this special event,

342
00:22:25,958 --> 00:22:27,666
which has become so popular,

343
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:31,708
it will now be held
once every three years!

344
00:22:31,791 --> 00:22:34,708
This one promises
to be the biggest yet,

345
00:22:34,791 --> 00:22:38,625
with a record-high attendance of
one hundred eighty-two fighters.

346
00:22:38,708 --> 00:22:42,166
All of you are talented martial
artists in your own right.

347
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:46,791
However, only one will be
crowned the World's Champion!

348
00:22:46,875 --> 00:22:48,583
[NARRATOR]
Goku is about to face off

349
00:22:48,666 --> 00:22:52,333
against a horde of the fiercest
warriors he's ever encountered,

350
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:54,833
next time on Dragon Ball!
