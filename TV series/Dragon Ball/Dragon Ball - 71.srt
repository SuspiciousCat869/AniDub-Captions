Eh? Hm. Don't get pushy.
This had better be good.

160
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:21,166
Now here they come.

161
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:23,208
We're only gonna
get one shot at this!

162
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:26,750
[YAMCHA groaning]

163
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:28,458
Okay! Now!

164
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:32,083
[ROSHI yelps]

00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:33,541

00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:35,041
Huh?

167
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:37,666
[SEE-THROUGH] What is this?
I'm-I'm completely covered!

168
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,833
[YAMCHA]
Oh yeah... like a target.

169
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:41,083
No.

170
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:43,041
--[GROUP cheering]
--[GOKU] Wow! He's small.

171
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:44,833
Get 'em, Yamcha!

172
00:10:44,916 --> 00:10:47,750
[YAMCHA chuckles]
It's my turn!

173
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:49,583
[BABA growls]

174
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:54,041

[PUAR laughs]

181
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:27,250
[SEE-THROUGH]
I quit. Mama was right.

182
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:29,541
I'm not cut out
for show business.

183
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:35,541
[YAMCHA sighs]

184
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:39,291
Yeah!

185
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:45,041
[ALL cheering]

00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:49,500
Yay! Yay!

188
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:51,375
[BULMA grunts]

189
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:53,166
Normally I deplore violence,

190
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:55,666
but in your case,
I'll make an exception!

191
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:56,833
I understand you're upset

192
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:58,625
but I just want you
to know one thing...

193
00:11:58,708 --> 00:11:59,541
I love you.

194
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:01,166
[BULMA yells]
[KRILLIN groans]

195
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:06,083
Boy, you've got some nerve,
pulling a crazy stunt like that!

196
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:07,416
Forgive me, Master.

197
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,500
I was just trying
to help Yamcha.

198
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:12,458
[ROSHI] It was reckless.
And I loved every minute of it.

199
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:14,625
[KRILLIN giggles]

200
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:16,166
[BULMA grumbles]

201
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:19,416
Your team is clever...

202
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:23,791
But that won't save you
from my remaining forces.

203
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:37,458
[YAMCHA sighs]

204
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:39,166
Huh?

205
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:42,375
Bulma, Master Roshi.
I didn't know you were coming.

206
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:44,291
Neither did we.

207
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:48,833
Huh. This is a strange setup
for a fortuneteller. Krillin?

208
00:12:48,916 --> 00:12:50,041
Hm?

209
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:52,000
[BULMA]
Is this Fortune Teller Baba's?

210
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:53,416
[KRILLIN]
That's right.

211
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:56,791
I see. Well, if her
business is telling fortunes,

212
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:59,791
then why does she have you
guys fighting in an arena?

213
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:02,333
Uh, actually Baba is doing
us a big favor here.

214
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:05,625
You see, normally it costs a lot
of money to use her services.

215
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:07,916
So... she takes
it out of your hide?

216
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,416
That's a bargain.

217
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,708
A-A-Ah-choo!

218
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,708
If you can't afford
to pay her fee,

219
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:17,166
she gives you the option of
battling her five fighters.

220
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:18,458
If you can defeat them all,

221
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:20,708
she'll tell your
fortune for free.

222
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:24,791
Yep. My sister is a
shrewd businesswoman.

223
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:26,583
[KRILLIN, BULMA]
Huh?

224
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:29,333
Huh? Hey, what do you
mean by sister?

225
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:32,208
[ROSHI]
I mean Baba is my older sister.

226
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:34,375
[ALL]
Baba is your sister?!

227
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:37,125
You look alike,
especially the beard.

228
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:39,375
That's not funny, Goku.

229
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:43,041
Okay, this is weird. Ugh.

230
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:44,458
But of course that
does explain

231
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:47,875
why she lives in
the middle of a desert.

232
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:49,250
Touché.

233
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:53,333
Well, look who showed up.

234
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:55,208
[BABA] We could have
used you last week when

235
00:13:55,291 --> 00:13:59,291
we moved mother. And you
missed my birthday again.

236
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:01,125
Happy Birthday.

237
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:02,833
Master Roshi...

238
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:04,916
Since you and Baba
are related, maybe you could

239
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,166
put in a good word for us,
and she could tell

240
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:09,333
our fortune without
any more fighting.

241
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:12,208
That's right. Family helps
each other out.

242
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:15,041
No more fighting
sounds fine with me.

243
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:16,416
That sounds great!

244
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,458
[GOKU]
Mm-hm!

245
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:23,000
Are you kidding me?
For family, I charge double.

246
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:26,166
What? You would refuse
your own brother?

247
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:27,541
You bet.

248
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:33,375
Hey, sounds good to me.
This is great for my training.

249
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:34,916
Then let's get on with it.

250
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,208
For our third match, we're going
to need a change of scenery.

251
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:41,125
[BABA]
Follow me.

252
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:42,750
[YAMCHA]
Sure.

253
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:53,333
[BULMA sighs] I can't believe,
in my life, this is normal.

254
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:00,333
[ROSHI]
So, uh, how 'bout

255
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:01,958
loaning your little
brother some cash?

256
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:04,583
You still haven't paid back
the last money I let you borrow.

257
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:06,708
Ten zeni isn't much,
but with 30 years interest,

258
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:09,000
I could buy myself
a new crystal ball!

259
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:13,250
Darn... I was hoping you
had forgotten about that.

260
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:14,583
I never forget.

261
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:17,416
Especially money I lend
to dead-beat brothers.

262
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,208
Sure. Check's in the mail.

263
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:22,250
How old are you anyway?

264
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:24,750
It's not polite to ask
a lady her age.

265
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:26,166
[GOKU]
Right. So, how old are you?

266
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:29,708
[BABA gasps] Why, I never!
Who do you think you are?

267
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,625
You should learn some manners!

268
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:34,708
Goku happens to be
one of my pupils.

269
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:36,500
That's right!

270
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:39,208
Well, that explains it.

271
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:42,416
What's your name?

272
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,416
[UPA] I'm known as Upa.
Nice to meet you.

273
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,000
Oh, Upa! Yeah,
I've heard about you.

274
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:49,083
In fact, you're the reason Goku
is looking for the Dragon Balls.

275
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:51,125
He hopes to revive
your father, right?

276
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:52,458
Uh-huh.

277
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:54,083
Upa, listen. I wouldn't
get too chummy with Bulma.

278
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:56,666
She changes temperature real
quick, if you know what I mean.

279
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,416
--Quick!
--[UPA] Huh?

280
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,083
Take that back, runt!

281
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:01,416
[KRILLIN]
See what I mean.

282
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:08,791
[GOKU]
Boy, this place is huge!

283
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:10,541
[BABA]
This way.

284
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:12,958
[YAMCHA] Where exactly
am I going to be fighting?

285
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:15,375
[ROSHI]
In the Devil's Toilet.

286
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:17,833
Whoa! That doesn't
sound good at all...

287
00:16:17,916 --> 00:16:19,708
[YAMCHA]
What is it?

288
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:21,708
Do you have any advice
you can give me?

289
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:23,458
[ROSHI laughs]

290
00:16:23,541 --> 00:16:26,916
Yeah sure... If I were you,
I wouldn't fall in.

291
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,541
Oh, well thanks
for the warning.

292
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:30,833
[ROSHI]
Don't mention it.

293
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:38,291
The fighters must enter
through this door.

294
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:39,791
Alright.

295
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:44,041
[BABA] The rest of you
climb the stairs.

296
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:47,500
You'll find seats at the top.
Goku, stay with me.

297
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:48,916
[GOKU]
Okay.

298
00:16:51,416 --> 00:16:54,166
[BABA]
Wait a minute. Let's go in here.

299
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:58,958
[BULMA]
Where are Goku and Baba?

300
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:01,583
[KRILLIN] They were right
ahead of us a minute ago.

301
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:03,958
[ROSHI] Don't worry.
We'll see them at the match.

302
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:07,000
My sister loves to
pull tricks like this.

303
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:09,875
[GOKU] That shiny thing up
there is as bright as a star!

304
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:12,708
This place is beautiful.

305
00:17:12,791 --> 00:17:15,625
[BABA] It's not much,
but it's home.

306
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:19,583
[BABA] You can take
this seat right here.

307
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:20,708
[GOKU]
Okay.

308
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:25,750
[GOKU sniffing]

309
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:28,541
Something smells wonderful!

310
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:32,750
[BABA chuckles] Indeed.
See-Through! The first course!

311
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:34,541
[SEE-THROUGH]
Certainly.

312
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,583
[GOKU]
This looks delicious!

313
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:43,375
Yes! Go ahead, dig in.

314
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:45,500
Thank you so much!

315
00:17:58,208 --> 00:18:00,291
Oh, this is creepy...

316
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:03,625
[YAMCHA] I don't even wanna know
where she got all these bones.

317
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:09,208
[ROSHI grunting]

318
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:12,208
[BULMA] I guess an elevator
would have upset the décor.

319
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:14,833
How many more steps are there?

320
00:18:14,916 --> 00:18:17,291
I stopped counting at 1,000.

321
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:22,083
[BABA]
How is it?

322
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:23,541
[GOKU]
Great!

323
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:37,708
[GOKU yelps]

324
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:47,083
[GOKU grunting]

325
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:48,125
[SEE-THROUGH groans]

326
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:48,958
Ha!

327
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:50,291
[BABA groans]

328
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:52,541
[SEE-THROUGH groans]

329
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:55,208
Did you know you have
a hole in your ceiling?

330
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:57,916
Oh boy, am I hungry!

331
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,791
The kid's reflexes are amazing!

332
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:01,875
I hate to admit it
but I think my brother

333
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:03,416
finally did something right.

334
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:14,750
[YAMCHA groans]
Great. Tongues for a bridge.

335
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:16,791
Why am I not surprised.

336
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:29,958
[YAMCHA]
Now that is just vile!

337
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:32,041
[ALL gasp]

338
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:37,166
[ROSHI] That's the toilet...
It smells worse than it looks.

339
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:40,500
[BULMA]
Ew! How disgusting!

340
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:42,458
[PUAR]
Yuck!

341
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:47,958
Yamcha, look.

342
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:50,083
Huh? Oh!

343
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:51,333
[KRILLIN]
What's he doing?

344
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:54,333
If he falls in, he's done for.

345
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,625
[BULMA]
Yamcha!

346
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:03,000
Hey!

347
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:04,458
Goku's back!

348
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:08,750
[BULMA] Where have you
been all this time?

349
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:10,958
Eating!

350
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:12,958
Goku, there's something
called poison!

351
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:15,333
I wouldn't eat anything
in present company.

352
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:18,875
Give me some credit!
Even I have standards...

353
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:22,208
What do you think of
your new surroundings?

354
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:24,666
It makes a cemetery look cozy.

355
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,208
[BABA]
That will be the next stop

356
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:28,833
for whoever falls into the pot.

357
00:20:28,916 --> 00:20:30,708
That's not good.

358
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:31,958
There is only one way

359
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:36,041
that I can personally
guarantee your safety.

360
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:39,541
Yeah! Let me guess, you want
each of us to donate an organ?!

361
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:42,250
Sounds tempting.
But no, I want Goku!

362
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:47,208
[ALL gasping]

363
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:50,708
N-Not Goku!

364
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:52,083
Right-o!

365
00:20:56,333 --> 00:21:00,250
[GOKU] Uh... What's wrong?
What do you want me for?

366
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:02,666
With your abilities,
you will be a prize addition

367
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:04,416
to my team of fighters!

368
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:08,500
She's joking, right?

369
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:11,750
Tell me your sister
has a sense of humor.

370
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:14,583
I'm sorry I brought
you kids into this.

371
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:17,875
Yamcha can win.
Trust me, Master.

372
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:19,083
[ROSHI grunts]

373
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:24,041
Don't be a fool. This is
a fight you cannot win.

374
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:28,750
Here comes Yamcha!

375
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:30,875
[ALL gasp]

376
00:21:37,791 --> 00:21:41,291
What is he doing? Is he nuts?!

377
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:43,041
He won't fight alone!

378
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:44,333
Hm?

379
00:21:45,875 --> 00:21:47,375
Goku.

380
00:21:48,666 --> 00:21:50,916
I am the reason
we're all here, Master.

381
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,041
I have to fight.

382
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:55,041
Mm-hm. I understand.

383
00:21:55,125 --> 00:21:57,125
Now go show them
what you're made of.

384
00:21:57,208 --> 00:21:59,625
Yes, sir. I won't let you down.

385
00:22:00,791 --> 00:22:01,958
Good luck.

386
00:22:02,041 --> 00:22:04,000
Good luck, my friend.

387
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:05,250
[GOKU]
Hm!

388
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:10,000
[BABA cackles]
So eager to die.

389
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:15,708
[NARRATOR]
Goku has refused Baba's offer

390
00:22:15,791 --> 00:22:17,625
and chosen to fight...

391
00:22:17,708 --> 00:22:22,083
But in this arena,
losing means certain death.

392
00:22:22,166 --> 00:22:23,875
And what of Yamcha's fate?

393
00:22:23,958 --> 00:22:26,791
Which of Fortune Teller Baba's
evil henchmen

394
00:22:26,875 --> 00:22:28,916
must he battle next?

395
00:22:33,416 --> 00:22:36,000
[NARRATOR]
To find out, don't miss the next

396
00:22:36,083 --> 00:22:40,000
astounding episode
of Dragon Ball!
