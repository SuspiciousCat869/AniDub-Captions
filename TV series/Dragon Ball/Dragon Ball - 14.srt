[NARRATOR] When we last
left the Dragon Ball gang,

2
00:02:16,166 --> 00:02:19,583
Goku said his goodbyes to Bulma,
and ventured off alone across

3
00:02:19,666 --> 00:02:22,666
the land heading toward the
island of the Turtle Hermit,

4
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,333
Master Roshi.

5
00:02:24,416 --> 00:02:26,625
[NARRATOR] With the old
teacher's help, Goku sought

6
00:02:26,708 --> 00:02:28,833
to improve his
skills of martial arts.

7
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,166
[GOKU] Hey, this place
is right by my house!

8
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:39,416
I've never seen it
from the sky before!

I'm hungry...

11
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:06,083
Hey, Master Roshi
must have some food!

12
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:08,041
Yay, let's go!

[BULMA screaming]

15
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:46,708
[OOLONG] That baby's
like a deep-fryer...

16
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:49,291
And I was almost
a well-done porkroast!

17
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:51,416
It's a good
thing we jumped.

18
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,875
[BULMA] Help me!

19
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:55,250
I'm stuck here!

20
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:57,416
[OOLONG] Hey, just let go!

21
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:00,541
Huh?

22
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:03,000
[BULMA] Ow!

23
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:08,208
[YAMCHA] You okay?

24
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:10,041
Yeah, but the
plane sure isn't!

25
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:12,791
Those ships still
have some kinks in 'em.

26
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:15,125
Yamcha, what now?

27
00:04:15,208 --> 00:04:18,166
Not sure. And that
was our last capsule.

[PUAR screams]

32
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:41,583
Why did we have
to crash into this place?

33
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:42,750
It's creepy!

34
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:45,916
It's not... so bad.

Well, I don't care what it
was, we're leaving!

Hey, where is he?

Well, we're done hunting
Dragon Balls for now.

And you said you'd teach me
martial arts! Remember?

chance bring that girl?

No, she went back
home with our friends.

to get stronger than you!

You must find
me a young gal!

It's the only way I
can start training you!

Okay!

162

But what's a "gow"?

163
00:11:56,291 --> 00:12:00,958
A gal! A fun girl
I can go on a date with!

164
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:04,541
Ohh... That's kinda weird.

165
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:07,416
But if I find this girl,
then you'll train me?

166
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,125
Oh yeah!

167
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:11,041
[GOKU laughing]

168
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:13,833
[GOKU] Yippee!

169
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:15,625
[ROSHI] Hold on there, Goku!

170
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:18,791
Are you sure you
know what to look for?

171
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:22,500
A stallion like me has
very particular tastes!

172
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:25,000
You want someone
who'll be your friend.

173
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:29,250
Well, that'd be nice...

174
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:32,416
But I've got a
few other guidelines.

175
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,000
I'm a sucker for nice skin.

176
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:37,750
She's not too young,
but not too old.

177
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:38,833
And funny, too!

178
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:40,583
That's a lot.

179
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:44,041
But what does her
skin have to do with it?

180
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:45,625
[ROSHI] Uh?

181
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:49,541
Well, uh, I guess that's a
lesson for another time.

182
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:52,333
Okay! I'll find
you someone nice!

183
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:54,166
That's my boy!

184
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:57,500
[ROSHI] Did you
know your tail's gone?

185
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:01,958
Yeah, I'm not sure
where it went to!

186
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:03,416
Guess it got bored!

187
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,416
[GOKU] Bye Master Roshi!

188
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:11,833
[ROSHI] That boy is strange.

189
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:33,375
[ROSHI humming]

190
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:39,000
[ROSHI humming]

191
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:42,291
[ROSHI] Yeah, you sly
turtle-man! Feel that boogie!

192
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:54,916
[ROSHI] Now which of these
shells says "stud-muffin"?

193
00:13:55,541 --> 00:14:02,000
[ROSHI humming]

194
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:04,666
[GOKU] Hey! Master
Roshi! She's here!

195
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:07,583
I'm coming!

196
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:10,083
[ROSHI screaming]

197
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:11,541
[gong crash]

198
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:15,708
Isn't she great?!

199
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:17,166
I'm ready to play!

200
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:35,666
Looks like your first
lesson won't be in Martial Arts!

201
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,750
Oh man!

202
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:42,375
Now, which of
these is prettier?

203
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,750
I like both!

204
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:52,000
What are you a saint?
Just get me one of these girls!

205
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:53,458
You got it?!

206
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:58,125
I don't see the
difference, but okay!

207
00:14:58,208 --> 00:14:59,708
[GOKU] Bye again!

208
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:02,875
Goodbye.

209
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:06,708
There's no telling who he'll
bring home this time!

210
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:08,000
I better hide!

211
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,458
[ROSHI] Let's see,
is my breath okay?

212
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:25,041
[ROSHI coughing]

213
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:26,500
Well, not too bad!

214
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:30,916
[ROSHI] Oh! Here he comes!

215
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:35,375
Yoo-hoo!

216
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:36,833
I'm back!

217
00:15:37,416 --> 00:15:38,791
[ROSHI] Please don't
be chunky...

218
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,666
Maybe he's asleep.

219
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:46,250
Now what does
this guy want?

220
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,416
[ROSHI] Goku! Goku!

221
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:05,166
[GOKU] Master Roshi,
Is this girl your type?!

222
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:06,416
Oh, you bet!

223
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,458
I'd say you just
hit the jackpot!

224
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:12,125
So you'll train me now?!

225
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:13,583
Oh, yes!

226
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:20,875
[ROSHI] Well, uh, let's begin
that lesson, uh, shall we?

227
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:27,875
I want you to ask that
girl there if, uh, she'd like

228
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:30,125
to go on a walk with me.

229
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:34,541
How is... that training?

230
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:36,083
[ROSHI] You want
to learn or not?!

231
00:16:37,666 --> 00:16:38,583
[GOKU] Lady!

232
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:40,875
I'm supposed to
ask you if, um...

233
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,791
[ROSHI] I'm so romantic.

234
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:45,916
I'm back!

235
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:48,958
[ROSHI] No, no!
He screwed it up for me!

236
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:52,916
She said she
won't walk with you.

237
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,208
What do you mean?!

238
00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:56,625
Well, she'd have a
much better time if you guys

239
00:16:56,708 --> 00:16:58,625
went for a swim instead!

240
00:17:01,375 --> 00:17:04,000
[ROSHI] Oh, it's
too good to be true!

241
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:06,166
What now?

242
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:09,041
[ROSHI] Well, now I go
accept her invitation!

243
00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:11,333
[ROSHI] Wow!

244
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:14,208
Everyone knows swimming is a
second or third date activity!

245
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:16,166
She must be crazy about me!

246
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:18,541
[ROSHI] Now, buckle down, Roshi!

247
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:20,458
It's time to show
off your moves!

248
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:24,833
Hi!

249
00:17:24,916 --> 00:17:26,166
Hi...

250
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:29,125
Do your legs hurt?
'Cause you've been running...

251
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:30,791
[ROSHI] all through my dreams!

252
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:32,375
Pardon?

253
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:37,416
I don't have legs.

254
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,250
So, you're a mermaid,
are you?!

255
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:46,416
[ROSHI] I knew there was
something fishy about this!

256
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:54,458
[ROSHI] I guess I can still
try with her human half!

257
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:59,125
[ROSHI] Well, uh, I'm like a
turtle, and you're part fish...

258
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:01,916
So, what do you say you
and me go inside and learn

259
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,916
more about our species?!

260
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,125
I get it! The lesson is
to keep your guard up!

261
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:14,000
Exactly.

262
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:17,083
[ROSHI] Yes.

263
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:18,708
Well, I'm glad
you paid attention

264
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:20,916
to the first lesson, Goku.

265
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,625
Never be open to an attack!

266
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:24,083
Got it!

267
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:26,750
[ROSHI] Good. Now, for your
next lesson, you will find me

268
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:29,166
another young gal,
who is very much like

269
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:31,416
the last one,
except for the fish part.

270
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:33,666
[GOKU] What? Again?!

271
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:38,791
I told you:
martial arts are not easy!

272
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:40,333
Yeah, okay!

273
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:43,625
[ROSHI] That do-gooder
Turtle is still on vacation!

274
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:45,625
I gotta make the best of it!

275
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,875
[GOKU] Look, Master Roshi!
Somebody's coming this way!

276
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:54,333
[ROSHI] What?! Is it Turtle?!

277
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:57,125
[ROSHI] I should've known
he'd spoil my plans!

278
00:18:57,208 --> 00:18:59,833
No, wait...
It's a someone in a boat.

279
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:24,875
[growling]

280
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:34,750
[shouting]

281
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:39,958
Who's the goof?

282
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:43,166
Better help him, kid.

283
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:50,625
Yeah, thanks.

284
00:19:53,708 --> 00:19:56,666
Ah! You're the great
Master Roshi, right?

285
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:58,500
[ROSHI] People tell me that.

286
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:02,208
Master, my name's Krillin
and I've come all the way

287
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:05,583
from a village in the East.
Please allow me to be your

288
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:07,833
humble student and learn
to fight like you.

289
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:10,625
Well, that's a
long way to come.

290
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:13,375
But, unfortunately, I do not
train every boy who shows

291
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:16,541
up at my door. Sorry.

292
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:21,000
[ROSHI] Hmm?

293
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:25,125
Maybe some quiet reading
will change your mind...?

294
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:26,583
[ROSHI] Ooh! Gimme gimme!

295
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:31,333
I brought it just for you.

296
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:36,333
So, who are you anyway?
His pupil?

297
00:20:36,416 --> 00:20:38,375
Yeah, I'm Goku!

298
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,458
Doesn't seem
that you like fighting.

299
00:20:44,541 --> 00:20:46,625
I like marshmallows!

300
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:50,125
What's that gotta
do with anything?

301
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:53,833
Well, I'm hungry and
your bald head looks like one!

302
00:20:53,916 --> 00:20:56,416
What did you say?!
Don't you know that everyone

303
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:59,375
who's serious about martial
arts shaves their head?!

304
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:02,708
Look at Master Roshi!
He shaves!

305
00:21:02,791 --> 00:21:04,625
[ROSHI] Nope.
I'm naturally bald.

306
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:15,291
[ROSHI] Krillin, after
careful consideration...

307
00:21:15,666 --> 00:21:17,375
Yeah?!

308
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:20,041
I've decided to
take you in as my student,

309
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:23,750
but only if you go help
Goku find me a girl!

310
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:28,166
I.. trust that you know...
the kind I like...?

311
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:31,791
[KRILLIN chuckling]

312
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:38,166
[KRILLIN whispering]

313
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:41,125
That's it!
Write that part down!

314
00:21:41,208 --> 00:21:43,041
I know my master's tastes!

315
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:44,666
Then what are we waiting for?!

316
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:48,041
Jump on that Nimbus
Cloud and find me a date!

317
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:49,416
A Nimbus?

318
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,916
Yeah, that's his name!

319
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,791
You named a cloud?

320
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:54,458
C'mon, jump on up!

321
00:21:56,291 --> 00:21:57,666
Okay...

322
00:22:01,916 --> 00:22:05,000
Hey! What's the deal
with this thing?!

323
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:07,333
[ROSHI] Only those
who have a pure heart

324
00:22:07,416 --> 00:22:10,041
can ride the Nimbus Cloud...

325
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:12,083
And that means...

326
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:14,708
you've been hiding
something from us!

327
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:16,208
Don't hurt me!

328
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:19,333
I just have some magazines
that I'm not supposed to read!

329
00:22:20,166 --> 00:22:23,291
You mean... you have more?

330
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:24,750
I'm sorry, Master Roshi!

331
00:22:24,833 --> 00:22:26,208
I didn't show you
because the first one

332
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:29,666
seemed to do the trick!
Here, have 'em!

333
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:33,083
[ROSHI chuckling]

334
00:22:33,166 --> 00:22:36,083
Here, take them all!
I don't want them anymore!

335
00:22:36,166 --> 00:22:39,958
Here! And that's one...
and two... and wait...

336
00:22:40,041 --> 00:22:41,166
[ROSHI screaming]

337
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:43,208
[KRILLIN] Here's one,
here's another one.

338
00:22:43,291 --> 00:22:46,833
[NARRATOR] So, Master Roshi has
taken two students on this day.

339
00:22:46,916 --> 00:22:49,041
But what will
come of these boys?

340
00:22:49,125 --> 00:22:52,166
Will they be friends?
Or foes?
