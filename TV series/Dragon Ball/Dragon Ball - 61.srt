Previously on Dragon Ball,

00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:19,208
by the cruel Mercenary Tao,

sent to destroy Goku for
the Red Ribbon Army.

Easy on the speech, okay?

167
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:54,166
You're hard on the ears.

168
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:57,375
Don't talk? But you asked me to.

169
00:14:57,458 --> 00:15:00,041
Just lock your jaw
for a minute, would ya?

170
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:16,625
You have to defeat Tao
the Mercenary to retrieve

171
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:18,958
your Dragon Balls and then
collect the other three

172
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:21,083
so you can wish Upa's
father back to life.

173
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:22,833
Is that the gist of it?

174
00:15:22,916 --> 00:15:25,250
What?! How could you
know all of that

175
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:27,791
when I didn't even say
anything about it?!

176
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:31,375
I--read--minds.

177
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:34,458
But don't worry, kid, there
weren't that many chapters.

178
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:35,583
Aahh...

179
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:37,125
Amazing!

180
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:39,041
Thanks, but you're
an easy audience.

181
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:41,500
Pure minds are like
looking through glass.

182
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:43,125
So it's alright then?

183
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:48,291
Don't worry, I'll get it.

184
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:53,875
This is great!

185
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:56,458
I can't wait to see
how strong it makes me!

186
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:57,958
How does it look up there?

[GOKU gasps]

188
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:00,875
Fine. I've got it.

189
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:02,416
[KORIN] Are you sure?

190
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,875
No problem.

191
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,791
Haaah!

[GOKU yells]

193
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:20,250
You said I could have
the Sacred Water!

194
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:22,291
If that's what I said,
then don't mind me.

195
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:23,875
Have all you want...

196
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:26,083
Go on. What are you waiting for?

197
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:28,583
Okay. Then I'll try again.

What's the big idea?!

201
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
You said I could
drink... Didn't you?

202
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:38,708
That's right...

203
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:40,791
If you can get around me.

204
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:43,125
Alright, then. Two can
play at that game!

[GOKU whimpers]

00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:53,708
Not that this isn't any fun,
but before you play the game,

210
00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:55,666
maybe you should
read the directions.

It's right here...

Keep your eyes on the prize.

that bottle! Count on it!

if you want to give up.

You're too fast.
I can't catch you.

That's right, if you
keep that attitude.

You can't retrieve what
your mind can't conceive.

doing is reacting to me.

ever been anyone

00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:26,375
who was able to climb the tower
and get the bottle from you?

00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:29,833
Yes. But only one,
about 300 years ago.

252
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:38,208
Exactly how old
are you anyway?

253
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:40,458
Eight hundred years.
Give or take a few.

Judging by the way you move,

I'd say... your teacher is
the old turtle-hermit, Roshi.

You mean Master Roshi, my Master
Roshi climbed this tower...?

Is that how he became so strong,
by drinking the sacred water?

[KORIN] Mm-hmm.

was the first one here!

Believe it or not, it's true.

He was a tricky one.

Why do you say that?
Was he really fast?

to get the bottle from you?

to get the Sacred Water,
how long will it take Goku?
