00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:46,541
[BOTH scream]

329
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:48,500
[BOTH scream]

330
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:56,041
[BOTH snoring]

331
00:19:56,125 --> 00:20:00,833
[snoring]

332
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:12,916
[people chattering]

333
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,875
[BOTH]
Aah! Aah!

334
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:22,083
[MAN chuckles]

335
00:20:22,958 --> 00:20:25,666
The preliminary round
is about to begin.

336
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,750
Will all contestants
please report

337
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:30,541
to the fighting arena
at this time.

338
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:35,250
Master, did you remember
to bring my uniform along?

339
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:36,416
No, young man.

340
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,666
Your old uniform
no longer suits you,

341
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:40,416
both in size and stature.

342
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:44,375
You've all surpassed my lessons.
What you wear is your own.

343
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:46,416
It's up to you now.

344
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,041
[GROUP]
Thanks!

345
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:51,291
[ALL laughing]

346
00:20:57,333 --> 00:21:01,416
[grunting]

347
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:05,041
[humming]

348
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:11,750
Ta-da! Eat your heart out!
Isn't it great?

349
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:13,000
I knew Master Roshi
wouldn't let us

350
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:14,541
have our old uniforms back,

351
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:17,250
so I had this one altered.
What do you think?

352
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:19,041
[YAMCHA]
Hm!

353
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:21,583
Seems like we know
the same tailor.

354
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:22,958
[KRILLIN]
Uh! Mmm!

355
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:24,750
[GOKU]
Me too!

356
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:25,916
[chuckles]

357
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,250
Oh great. Next thing ya know,

358
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:28,791
you'll both be
shaving your heads!

359
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:30,583
[laughs]

360
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:33,541
Goku! What happened
to your tail?

361
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,375
Oh that? I got rid of it.

362
00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:36,833
[KRILLIN]
Uh...

363
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:38,791
You see, it turned out that
the moon could be restored

364
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:40,291
if I lost my tail.

365
00:21:40,375 --> 00:21:42,916
So that's what I decided to do.

366
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,333
[KRILLIN]
Uh...

367
00:21:44,416 --> 00:21:45,708
[YAMCHA]
Hm.

368
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:47,750
[BOTH chuckle]

369
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:50,500
Did you ever
find it again? Ha-ha-ha!

370
00:21:50,583 --> 00:21:52,791
[grunts]

371
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:55,333
Huh? What's the matter?

372
00:21:55,416 --> 00:21:56,958
I was joking.

373
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:00,916
[GOKU]
Hmm!

374
00:22:09,791 --> 00:22:12,750
With that face, I'd say
he's one of Shen's boys.

375
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:16,208
Do you know who he is, Goku?

376
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:18,708
--[TIEN grunts]
--[CHIAOTZU] Huh?

377
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:23,208
No! He looks like...

378
00:22:23,291 --> 00:22:25,958
But that's... impossible!

379
00:22:31,333 --> 00:22:35,333
[GOKU] Piccolo! I knew you'd
show up sooner or later!

380
00:22:35,875 --> 00:22:39,083
[NARRATOR] Tensions flare as
King Piccolo's alter ego,

381
00:22:39,166 --> 00:22:42,500
Junior, makes his
grand entrance.

382
00:22:42,583 --> 00:22:45,708
How will his presence
affect Goku and the others?

383
00:22:45,791 --> 00:22:48,916
Is Goku strong enough
to defeat the alien?

384
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,958
The World Martial Arts
Tournament begins next time,

385
00:22:53,041 --> 00:22:55,000
on Dragon Ball!
