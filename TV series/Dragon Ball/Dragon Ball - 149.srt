Previously on Dragon Ball...

[NARRATOR] After saying

7
00:02:33,666 --> 00:02:35,958
Goku embarked on his
Nimbus cloud toward

8
00:02:36,041 --> 00:02:42,166

with his new fiancée, ChiChi.

[GOKU] I don't see your

it's a good one.

[NARRATOR] Asking a father for
his daughter's hand in marriage

21
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:15,291
is a daunting task. But Goku's
anxiety is understandable,

22
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:18,375
for ChiChi's father not
only governs his household,

23

but an entire kingdom as well.

24
00:03:20,916 --> 00:03:23,458
He is the Ox King,
a mighty ruler,

whose serene land is made even
more so on this beautiful day.

325
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:52,458
This is strange.
I don't see a valley,

326
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:54,708
only mountains and forests.

sleeping with a light on.

[BOTH sigh]

331
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:07,000
[BABA] It feels wonderful
in here, ChiChi.

332
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:10,833
Aaah!

333
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,333
What are you waiting for, girl?

334
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:16,041
Goku.

[UNNAN groans]

336

Uh, come on! Get in!

337
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,458
Oh, please find the fan, Goku.

338
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:28,000
[grunting] Is that all
she thinks about?

339
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:38,166
There's no valley around here.

340
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,208
Nothing but sand.

341
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:44,166
This is just a waste of time.

342
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:53,875
You can worry yourself to death.

343
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:56,875
It won't help Goku
find the fan any faster.

344
00:18:56,958 --> 00:19:01,625
Try the spa a few minutes.
What have you got to lose?

345
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:04,500
Yes, you're right.

346
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:06,250
I could us a hot bath.

found the Bansho fan.

us how to make the fan!
