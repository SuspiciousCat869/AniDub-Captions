[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball...

2
00:02:14,291 --> 00:02:16,416
King Piccolo began his
invasion of the world

3
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,500
in the most unlikely of places,

4
00:02:18,583 --> 00:02:20,916
King's Castle,
a symbol of peace,

5
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,041
which the conqueror
reduced to pieces.

6
00:02:40,416 --> 00:02:43,291
[NARRATOR] In an instant,
King Furry's entire kingdom

7
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:47,208
was transformed into
a barren wasteland.

Piccolo promised more death
and destruction if King Furry

10
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:59,291
did not comply with his demands.

11
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:01,625
After an exhaustive journey,

12
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:07,958
Goku and Yajirobe finally made
it to the top of Korin's Tower.

13
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:10,958
Master Korin was surprised
to learn of Goku's desire

14
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:12,958
to undertake
additional training,

15
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:15,791
and advised his pupil that
engaging King Piccolo

16
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:19,916
in further conflict would
result in his own demise.

You will prepare a new

Dishes of newt manure, deep
fried eyes, fresh moose pie,

00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:30,333
with dinosaur tongue
and brain pudding.

24

[PIANO] You will prepare 111
of each dish within the hour.

29
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:27,916
That's right. This water
is most certainly divine.

30
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,916
But, Master Korin,

31
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,875
how is it any different
than the Sacred Water

32
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:35,041
I drank a long time ago?

33
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:37,500
Actually, there is
a huge difference.

34
00:05:37,583 --> 00:05:40,125
You see, Sacred Water is
merely water with a kick.

35
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:42,541
No magic in it. Ha.

36
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:45,666
But Ultra Divine water is packed
with mystical properties

37
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,750
and a magical zing!

38
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:50,666
Whoa! If I drink
Ultra Divine Water,

39
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:54,166
then I'll be super strong! Hey!

40
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:57,041
Come on, Master, give me some
of the Ultra Divine Water!

41
00:05:57,125 --> 00:05:59,458
Please, Master! Please, please!

42
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:02,208
Enough! Some things
never change.

43
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:04,583
You're just as hasty as ever!

44
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:06,625
I can't help it, Master.

45
00:06:06,708 --> 00:06:08,833
You said I'd be stronger
if I drink it.

46
00:06:08,916 --> 00:06:12,458
[KORIN] The water would increase
your abilities, that's true.

47
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:14,375
But to enjoy its benefits,
you would first

48
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:16,625
have to track it down.

49
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:18,208
Huh?

50
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:21,625
[KORIN] It is a perilous
journey. Far to the north,

51
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:24,750
there is a treacherous
maze of ice.

52
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:26,958
To obtain the water,
you must first navigate

53
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:29,083
through this icy labyrinth.

54
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:32,458
The liquid is hidden
somewhere in the cave.

[GOKU]
A maze? What's that?

56
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:38,250
[KORIN] It's a complicated
network of passageways,

57
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:44,041
with many confusing routes to
choose from, but only one exit.

58
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:48,000
It's easy enough to get in.
The trick is getting out.

59
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:51,166
Once inside the labyrinth,
it's easy to get lost.

60
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:54,500
You can find yourself
wandering aimlessly for weeks,

61
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:58,125
or even years!

62
00:06:58,208 --> 00:07:01,625
Many brave explorers have
attempted to navigate this path,

63
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:05,291
only to never be
heard from again.

64
00:07:19,916 --> 00:07:23,208
Now that you know the peril
involved, what will you do?

65
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:25,458
Do you still wish to seek it?

00:07:25,541 --> 00:07:28,791
Mm! Sure do! I'm not
afraid of the maze.

Of course not! Why in the
