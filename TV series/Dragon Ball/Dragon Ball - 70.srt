00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,291
[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball...

2
00:02:16,708 --> 00:02:19,458
[GHOST]
Behold, Fortuneteller Baba!

3
00:02:21,416 --> 00:02:23,375
[BABA]
Good.

4
00:02:28,958 --> 00:02:32,958
Oh my, you've brought
me young ones this time.

5
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:35,583
[NARRATOR] Unable to locate
the last Dragon Ball,

6
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:38,916
Goku and his friends paid
a visit to Fortuneteller Baba

7
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
in hopes of learning
its whereabouts.

8
00:02:41,083 --> 00:02:43,416
Unfortunately,
they were not prepared

9
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,250
to meet the condition
for Baba's service.

10
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:48,791
[BABA] Before taxes,
and with our coupon,

11
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:52,000
it will run you roughly
around 10,000,000 zeni.

12
00:02:52,083 --> 00:02:54,458
What's the matter?
Is that a lot?

13
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:55,750
I beg your pardon, ma'am,

14
00:02:55,833 --> 00:02:59,166
but-but we don't have
that much money!

15
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,166
[NARRATOR] So the spooky
Fortuneteller gave them

16
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:04,875
another payment option.
One financed with danger.

17
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:27,375
Wait. So let me
get this straight.

18
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:30,000
You want us to fight your
five guys in a series

19
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:32,333
of one on one matches,
and if we win,

20
00:03:32,416 --> 00:03:34,875
you'll tell us our
fortune for free?

21
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:36,500
That's right. You're correct.

22
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:39,416
But I warn you,
think this through carefully.

23
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,833
You are children and these
are no ordinary fighters.

24
00:03:42,916 --> 00:03:45,208
I'm no child, and my
friends may be small,

25
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:47,125
but they can handle themselves.

26
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:49,375
We're prepared for
your challenge. Right?

27
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:50,375
Of course we are.

28
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:52,708
I say bring it on.
We can take 'em!

29
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:56,500
I'd like to help you,
but I left my spear back home.

30
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:59,916
I'd prefer to be a
spectator on this one.

31
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,458
Okay. Looks like it will
be the three of us.

32
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:06,541
Hmph. Oh, so the three
of you brave souls

33
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:09,291
think you can take on
my five warriors?

34
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:13,041
[laughs] Now this
I've got to see!

35
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:15,583
[KRILLIN chuckles]
I know the odds are uneven,

36
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:18,083
but don't worry.
We'll go easy on 'em.

37
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:20,250
And, what are the
rules of the fight?

38
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:21,541
It's very simple.

39
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:23,125
We'll continue until one person

40
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:25,625
is either thrown into
the lake or gives up.

41
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:27,583
You're right. It's quite simple.

42
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:30,250
I like it that way.
Losers swim.

43
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:33,375
I sure hope your fighters
are ready to take a bath.

44
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:37,208
Well, what fine spirit.

45
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:39,875
Now, which one of you
is going to fight first?

46
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,750
Come on, isn't it obvious?

47
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:45,583
Splendid.

48
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:48,208
[GOKU]
Hey, Krillin! Good luck!

49
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:49,583
Yeah, well, get comfortable.

50
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:52,500
You might be there a while.
There's gonna be five

51
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:54,916
wet fighters before
I leave the ring.

52
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,291
Just put 'em down quick.

53
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:58,291
Don't worry. It's me.

54
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:02,708
I remember everything
from the last tournament...

55
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:05,166
Including the roar of the crowd.

56
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:08,166
[crowd cheering]

57
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:11,333
Fangs, the Vampire, come forth.

58
00:05:11,416 --> 00:05:15,666
"Fangs, the Vampire"?
You gotta' be kiddin' me.

59
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:20,666

61
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:29,500
A bat?! This is a joke, right?

62
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:32,416
I'm a fighter, not a zookeeper!

63
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:45,000
[FANGS laughing]

64
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:48,166
Whoa! How did he do that?

65
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:59,208
[FANGS grunting]

[FANGS grunting]

00:06:04,916 --> 00:06:07,958
Whoa! That guy needs a tan.

68
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:10,416
What, is he gonna
dance or fight?

69
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,541
Now, let the match begin.

70
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:20,875
[KRILLIN thinking] Hm. This
weirdo doesn't stand a chance.

71
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:29,833
Ready, Set, and Go!

72
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:32,375
[KRILLIN thinking] I was hoping
for a little challenge...

73
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:33,458
Oh well.

74
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:40,958
[FANGS mumbling]

75
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:45,916
You got lucky. But that
won't happen again.

[FANGS cackles]

78
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:55,916
Don't go getting carried away.
That was a lucky shot

79
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,916
and I'm not going to
give you a second one.

80
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,541
You don't know who
you're messin' with!

[FANGS mumbling]

82
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:07,791
Stop dancing...

Ooh...

Hm?

85
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,333
...and fight!

I don't get it, Yamcha.

89
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:27,750
Why did he turn
into a bat again?

90
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:30,000
I don't know. But he's
up to something.

[YAMCHA]
Calm down, Krillin, and breathe.

96
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:07,041
You must concentrate
on his movements. Focus!

00:10:56,791 --> 00:10:58,041
He'll be good as new.

164
00:10:58,125 --> 00:10:59,250
[KRILLIN groaning]

165
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:01,166
Krillin, are you okay?

166
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:02,375
Hang in there.

167
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:11,833
What happened? Didn't you
wanna fight all five?

168
00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:12,916
That's what I was doing

169
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,791
until you broke
my concentration!

170
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:21,166
[FANGS grunting]

171
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:22,875
Krillin has been defeated.

172
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:26,125
Who will be the next
to challenge my fighter?

173
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:27,666
[GOKU, YAMCHA]
Hm...

174
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,791
[KRILLIN] That fight was rigged.
I want a rematch!

175
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:32,000
Forget it. You're not fighting.

176
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:33,791
Oh! I got a good idea.

177
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:35,291
What is it?

178
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:39,166
I don't have all day, folks.
We're kind of on a schedule.

179
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:41,041
[KRILLIN] Well, how do
we get ol' bug eyes

180
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:42,041
to go along with it?

181
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:43,166
Simple. We'll just ask her.

182
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:45,125
She never said
we couldn't do it.

183
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:46,750
Puar's right.

184
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:48,958
Enough! We're running
into lunch!

185
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,333
[YAMCHA]
Sorry 'bout that.

186
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:52,416
We were just discussing
our lineup. It looks like

187
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,875
we're all gonna
have to fight.

188
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:57,583
Of course, genius!
What did you expect?

189
00:11:57,666 --> 00:11:59,916
[GOKU] Ma'am, would it
be alright if Puar and Upa

190
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,750
fought together since
they're so small?

191
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:04,125
It's up to you.

192
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:07,375
[FANGS] Ha! Why not.
Two heads are better than one.

193
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:10,333
Please tell me one
of you just ate pizza.

194
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:14,208
[UPA, PUAR whimper]

195
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:16,583
[BABA] It seems he
accepts your terms.

196
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:18,208
[GOKU]
Thank you.

197
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:20,583
[YAMCHA] Uh, could you just
give us a minute here?

198
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:23,208
We need to talk about something.

199
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:25,500
Hurry.

200
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:27,541
Well, one of you has to do it.

201
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:29,166
[KRILLIN]
I thought we decided on Upa?

202
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:30,375
Fine by me.

203
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,000
Okay, let's do it!

204
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:34,291
[BABA] I've got to set up
an age restriction...

205
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:36,583
This is ridiculous!

206
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:53,333
--[BULMA] Master Roshi?
--[ROSHI] Yes?

207
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:57,208
Is this Fortuneteller Baba
character really trustworthy?

208
00:12:57,291 --> 00:12:59,375
[OOLONG] She sounds like
a certifiable nut-case

209
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:01,208
if you ask me.

210
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:02,958
I understand your concerns,

211
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:04,625
but have a little
faith, will ya?

212
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:06,250
The old gal's been
tellin' fortunes

213
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:09,625
for about 500 years.
She knows what she's doing.

214
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:11,250
500 years?

215
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:14,208
[OOLONG] And that's the best
name she could come up with?!

216
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:16,250
Settle down.
She'll be able to locate

217
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:18,958
the last Dragon Ball.
No problem.

218
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:22,333
Great. So why did I waste
my time making the Dragon Radar?

219
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:23,916
We could have asked
your Fortuneteller

220
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,458
the whereabouts of the
Dragon Balls from the beginning.

221
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:29,041
[OOLONG] Yeah. We should
have contacted the old lady

222
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:31,958
a long time ago.
What a waste of time.

223
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:35,041
No, it's a bit more
complicated than that.

224
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:37,375
What do you mean?

225
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:43,041
Hm... Let's just say Baba
can be a 'killer' businesswoman!

226
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:45,291
In fact, I suspect
the boys are in

227
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:47,333
more than a little
bit of danger.

228
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:49,250
--[BULMA] Huh?
--[OOLONG] Oh...

229
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:56,083
[ROSHI chuckles]

230
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:58,375
But then again,
I've been wrong before.

231
00:13:58,458 --> 00:13:59,750
[OOLONG, BULMA groan]

232
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:06,916
[YAMCHA] Remember,
you'll have to act fast

233
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,958
so don't waste
any time out there.

234
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:10,375
[PUAR &amp; UPA]
Right.

235
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:16,291
[FANGS cackling]

236
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:19,416
Go Upa! And go Puar! Good luck!

237
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,416
Watch out, he's a biter!

238
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:25,000
[YAMCHA] You can do this.
He's nothing. Just focus!

have to do that for?

I wasn't gonna
bite you... Honest!

Impressive.

And now that the
warm-up match is over,

285
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:05,333
let's see how you fare
against my real fighters.

286
00:17:05,416 --> 00:17:09,333
That was incredible.
You fought better than Krillin.

287
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:11,791
I was just getting started.

288
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:14,791
You both did your jobs
very well, so take a break.

289
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:16,791
Now it's my turn to fight.

290
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:17,958
Great.

291
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:19,750
Thank you, Yamcha.

292
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:24,833
Ready... Bring out your
fighter and let's go.

293
00:17:24,916 --> 00:17:26,833
Vigor. I like that.

294
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:29,125
But I wonder if
you'd be so anxious

295
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:31,333
if you knew whom you
were about to fight.

296
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:33,708
Krillin was overly
confident as well

297
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:35,791
and look what happened to him.

298
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:37,583
Like I told you,
I'm not a child.

299
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:39,375
So save your concern
for my opponent.

300
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:41,791
This isn't my first time
in an arena.

301
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:44,375
Yamcha, let me fight with you.

302
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:46,291
I'm sure you could
defeat them all, Goku,

303
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:49,833
but I need the practice.
Don't worry, you'll fight later.

304
00:17:49,916 --> 00:17:51,166
So let's go.

305
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:53,000
I heard your lunch
is gettin' cold.

306
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:56,000
You go, Yamcha!
Knock their lights out!

307
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:58,208
Watch out. She's tricky.

308
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:06,291
Are we gonna fight or not?
Bring out my opponent.

309
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:08,916
Careful, my friend.
Pay attention.

310
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,458
Your opponent is already here.

311
00:18:11,541 --> 00:18:17,083
Huh? Where? I don't see anyone.

312
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:19,750
I told you that old
lady can't be trusted.

313
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:22,666
Wha--? Look at that!

314
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:27,291
Uh... That's weird.
Your opponent is a bug?

315
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:28,250
A bug.

316
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:30,333
[BABA grumbles]
Of course not!

317
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:31,875
[YAMCHA]
And all this time I didn't think

318
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:35,125
you had a sense of humor.
Come on, Baba, joke's over!

319
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:37,791
Do I look like
I'm capable of humor?

320
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:39,333
Hey, bright-eyes...

321
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:41,333
The reason you can't
see your opponent

322
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:43,708
is because he's invisible.

323
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:46,333
What?! How can I fight
what I can't see?!

324
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:48,916
What's invisible?

325
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,708
[BABA laughs] It means
see-through, transparent.

326
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:53,666
In other words, you won't
know he's there

327
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:54,708
until you've been hit.

328
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:56,208
[GOKU, UPA gasp]

329
00:18:57,291 --> 00:18:59,708
I don't have time to give
you a lesson in physics.

330
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:03,291
Close your mouths, watch the
fight and visit your library.

331
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:05,458
Now, let the match begin!

332
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:07,458
[YAMCHA growls]

333
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:26,375
[SEE-THROUGH laughs] Guess which
hand I have behind my back.

334
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:27,833
Is it the left...

335
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:29,458
[YAMCHA groans]

336
00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:30,375
[SEE-THROUGH]
...or the right?

337
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:32,958
[YAMCHA groans]

338
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:35,375
--[GOKU, UPA, KRILLIN gasp]
--Oh no! Yamcha!

339
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:40,791
[YAMCHA grunting]
Show yourself, you lousy coward!

340
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:42,958
[BABA cackles]

341
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:46,250
[YAMCHA grunts]

342
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:48,250
[YAMCHA]
An invisible man.

343
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:50,916
Next time, I'm definitely
bringing a coupon!

344
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,291
[YAMCHA screams,
SEE-THROUGH cackles]

345
00:19:53,375 --> 00:20:05,208
[YAMCHA grunting,
SEE-THROUGH cackling]

346
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:08,000
[YAMCHA panting]
Where is he?!

347
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:12,333
[BABA cackles]
You're an experienced fighter,

348
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:14,041
show us what ya got!

349
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:16,666
[YAMCHA panting]

350
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:21,500
[YAMCHA grunting]

351
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:23,166
[GOKU]
I don't get it...

352
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:25,541
How is Yamcha supposed
to fight someone

353
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:27,208
that he can't even see?

354
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:30,875
He's not. That's the point.
Its dirty fighting...

355
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:32,958
[KRILLIN] If Yamcha could
just lay eyes on him,

356
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:34,583
I know he could beat him!

357
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:37,916
That's it!

358
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,166
What's it?

359
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:41,583
Go find Master Roshi
and bring him back here.

360
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:43,625
And Bulma! We'll need her too!

361
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:45,250
Okay, but why?

362
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:47,583
Don't ask questions, just go!

363
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:51,166
If you say so... Flying Nimbus!

364
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:57,500
[GOKU grunts]

365
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:03,791
That's not fair.

366
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:06,500
He gets a cloud;
I'm stuck on a ball!

367
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:09,500
[YAMCHA groans, yells]

368
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:14,208
--[KRILLIN] Are you okay?
--[PUAR] Yamcha!

369
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:15,541
[BABA]
Stay back!

370
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:17,750
The rules state a fighter
cannot accept aid

371
00:21:17,833 --> 00:21:19,291
from a member of his team.

372
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:22,291
Please don't give up.
You can beat him.

373
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:24,000
Yamcha, just hang
in there long enough

374
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:25,583
for Goku to get back.

375
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:28,125
[YAMCHA grunts]

376
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:29,125
Yamcha!

377
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:29,791
Fight!

378
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:31,666
Protect yourself.

379
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:32,916
Right!

380
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:38,541
This doesn't make any sense...

381
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:40,958
How can Bulma and Roshi help?

382
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:44,750
[YAMCHA screaming, groaning]

383
00:21:46,708 --> 00:21:48,291
[YAMCHA]
What am I supposed to do?

384
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:49,916
I'm a sitting duck out here!

385
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,708
Whatever you've got planned,
Krillin, you better hurry.

386
00:21:52,791 --> 00:21:56,708
[BABA cackles]
He won't last much longer.

387
00:21:56,791 --> 00:21:59,750
[YAMCHA pants]
Wait a minute! Wait...

388
00:21:59,833 --> 00:22:03,375
I've been doing this all wrong.
I've gotta calm down and focus.

389
00:22:03,458 --> 00:22:07,666
If I can't see him...
maybe I can hear him.

390
00:22:12,041 --> 00:22:13,625
Yamcha! Move!
What are you--

391
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:16,541
[KRILLIN]
Shhhh! Be quiet!

392
00:22:20,791 --> 00:22:30,750
[footsteps]

393
00:22:30,833 --> 00:22:38,583
[footsteps]

394
00:22:38,666 --> 00:22:41,750
[NARRATOR] Can Yamcha
defeat his invisible opponent?

395
00:22:41,833 --> 00:22:45,958
And what does Krillin want
with Master Roshi and Bulma?

396
00:22:46,041 --> 00:22:48,750
Does he have a plan or
is he just looking to add

397
00:22:48,833 --> 00:22:50,375
to the cheering section?

398
00:22:50,458 --> 00:22:55,041
