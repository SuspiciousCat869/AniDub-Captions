[NARRATOR] Previously
on Dragon Ball...

00:02:15,541 --> 00:02:17,833
Goku successfully
obtained all seven

00:02:17,916 --> 00:02:21,041
of the mystical Dragon Balls
and awoke the Eternal Dragon

4
00:02:21,125 --> 00:02:22,958
for a very special wish:

5
00:02:23,041 --> 00:02:25,833
The resurrection of his
good friend Upa's father...

6
00:02:25,916 --> 00:02:28,916
Along the way, he managed
to defeat an assortment

7
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,625
of dastardly villains, including
Emperor Pilaf, Commander Red,

8
00:02:32,708 --> 00:02:34,916
and the entire Red Ribbon Army.

our hero has been busy.

[NARRATOR] At the

00:03:32,791 --> 00:03:34,791
Goku has set out on
a training mission

00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:36,916
with a new instructor: Life.

24
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,916
In hopes that the
young hero would discipline

25
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,791
his body as well as his mind,
the Turtle Hermit forbade

26
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:44,208
the use of the Nimbus Cloud
as transportation.

27
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:48,125
And so, we join Goku as he
continues his journey east.

You are our only hope...

come and take our food

barely enough to survive.

I'll defeat them.

00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:39,000
[TERROR] The food tastes fine.

167
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:39,958
Oh?

168
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:41,416
[chuckles]

169
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:47,166
[TERROR] It's the tribute
I find lacking.

170
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,375
Explain it to them.

171
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:51,125
We came here expecting a feast.

172
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:53,583
What you provided was
little more than a snack!

173
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:57,000
The dishes on this table are
half of what we had last month.

174
00:10:57,083 --> 00:10:59,125
Where's the chocolate cake?!

175
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:01,000
[FATHER] We've yielded
fewer crops this year

176
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:02,083
due to the drought.

177
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:04,041
Surely you can understand that.

178
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:08,291
I don't want your excuses...

179
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:11,375
But I will take your share
of the food supply.

180
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:13,000
No, that's impossible!

181
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:14,416
We can't give you our food.

182
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,458
Our families would
starve to death!

183
00:11:17,916 --> 00:11:18,916
[FATHER] Leave him alone!

184

[PLAGUE chuckles,

Tell me, grandpa,
what good is food

186
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:26,208
if your belly is full of holes?

187
00:11:26,291 --> 00:11:28,291
I don't think I'm
getting through to him.

188
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:30,375
Maybe we should use him
as an example.

189
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:32,125
No, wait...

190
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:35,958
Why waste the bullets when
we can just use the Gourd?

191
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:39,041
Excellent idea! Bring it out.
Let's take attendance!

192

You heard the man.

195
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:45,458
Gather your miserable hides
in the courtyard.

196
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:47,958
It's attendance time, and
you know what that means--

197
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:51,416
Did you hear what I said?!
Move, you insolent dogs!

198
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,166
It's time you faced the Gourd!

[FATHER] Everyone! Gather in
the courtyard for attendance!

Come on, we've got to hurry!

You're back!

I think I found someone
who can help us.

Oh, who?

214
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:01,250
Come here. I want you
to meet my father...

215
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:03,208
This is Goku.

216
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:05,208
But he's just a boy.

217
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:07,166
[HEADMAN] A baby.

218
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:09,791
Goku is strong, really.
I've seen him fight.

[glass shatters,

Peasants, your
attention, please...

221
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:17,666
You wouldn't want to miss
hearing your name called.

222
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:21,625
[PLAGUE] When I call your name,
a simple "here" will suffice.

223
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:23,333
Don't get creative.

Chao, I don't understand
what's going on.

234
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:42,166
Why is he calling out
their names like that?

235
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,916
Look over there.
Do you see that gourd?

236
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,291
[GOKU] What's a gourd?

237
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:48,083
[CHAO] It's a
hard-shelled fruit.

238
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:49,125
Like a melon.

239
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:50,791
Anyway, if someone's
name is called

240
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:52,166
and they don't
answer right away--

241
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:53,291
[PLAGUE] Chao!

242
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:54,375
Uh, here!

243
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:57,291
[PLAGUE] Mm...
That was a close one.

--Temjin!
--[TEMJIN] Here!

What happens if you
don't answer right away?

246
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:03,375
You'll be swallowed
by the gourd.

247
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:13,583
[CHAO] The gourd
releases a powerful mist

248
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:15,916
that can swallow a man whole.

249
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:26,250
[CHAO] Once inside, the
victim's life force is drained,

250
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:30,875
creating a potion that can be
consumed by another person.

251
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:35,250
[CHAO] We believe
it is the source

252
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:38,250
of Plague and Terror's strength.

No wait! My son, he can't speak.

258

He's a newborn.
He's only two weeks old!

[MOTHER] No! It's no--

No isn't a name. Speak up!

This is intolerable!
You know he can't say anything.

Leave her baby alone.

Do we have any more
heroes in the audience?

329
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:49,083
There's plenty of room!

330
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:50,666
All is lost.

331
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,916
[TERROR &amp; PLAGUE laugh]

332
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
[TERROR] This calls
for a celebration!

333
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:03,125
I can dance better than that!

334
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:05,291
You call this entertainment?!

335
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:07,041
As long as they
have that gourd,

336
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:08,666
we must submit to their will,

337
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:11,916
but I'm afraid it's going to
cost our village dearly.

338
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,625
[PLAGUE] I said I wanted my
bread extra toasted!

339
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:17,416
And where is that
chocolate cake?!

340
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,208
[CHAO] Goku...

341
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:21,708
Ka...

342
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:23,083
Me...

343
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:24,708
Ha...

344
00:18:24,791 --> 00:18:27,333
Me.. ha!

345
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:30,208
[GOKU gasps]

346
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:37,916
[GOKU] I guess I'm going to be
in here longer than I thought.

347
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,125
I've... got to go!

348
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:43,791
There's no more time.
I can't wait any longer!

349
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:46,625
I sure hope there's
nobody down there...

350
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:51,750
That should be
long enough, I think.

351
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:54,250
He's had plenty of time
to hit the bottom.

352
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:56,541
[GOKU] Haaa... Whaa... Hey!

353
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:58,166
[PLAGUE chuckles]

354
00:18:58,250 --> 00:18:59,833
Good, he's dissolved...

355
00:18:59,916 --> 00:19:03,291
It's been a long time
since I took my last drink.

356
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:04,166
Uhh...

357
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:05,625

[GOKU chuckles]

359
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:11,166
Goku!

360
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,583
How did you escape?!

361
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:14,708
[TERROR growls]

362
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:17,500
I'm back. Let's finish
what we started!

363
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:19,125
[PLAGUE] All right, little boy!

364
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:20,000
[TERROR yells]

365
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:20,875
I've got it!

366
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:22,333
[PLAGUE grunts]

367
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:24,375
[GOKU] Let's take attendance.

368
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:25,833

Alright, Terror!

371
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:31,250
Ah... Here!

372
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:31,916
[GOKU] Plague!

373
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:32,583
H-Here!

374
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:33,708
I can't hear you.

375
00:19:33,791 --> 00:19:35,375
--Terror. Terror!
--H-Here!

376
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:37,083

--Here! Here!

[BOTH chuckle]

Plague, Plague, Terror, Plague,
Plague, Plague, Terror,

Wait! I answered four times.

388
00:19:57,083 --> 00:20:00,166
No, three plus one is--
Have mercy...

389
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:01,833
I thought I had
trouble counting.

390
00:20:01,916 --> 00:20:03,875
Sorry, guys,
you just couldn't keep up.

Have pity!

394
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:13,375
Not the mist!

395
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:14,708
Have a nice trip.

396
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:18,833

--We're free!

[cheering continues]

403
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:44,125
Oh, Goku! Thank you! Thank you!

404
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:48,583
[TERROR] Please let us out.
We swear we'll be good!

405
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:51,791
Do you promise not to bother
the villagers any more?

406
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:54,041
[PLAGUE] Yes, yes, we promise!

407
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:57,541
[TERROR] Please help us!
I'm afraid of the dark!

[VILLAGERS laugh]

409
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:00,875

Come on! Concentrate.
Put your backs into it!

417
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:49,375
Right!

418
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:51,083
[FATHER] You have to finish
that field before lunch.

419
00:21:51,166 --> 00:21:52,333
Yes, sir!

420
00:21:52,416 --> 00:21:54,250
[CHAO] You'll eat
the amount that you plant!

421
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:56,000
Yeah!

422
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:58,333
You have to work hard
to get your share around here,

423
00:21:58,416 --> 00:22:00,166
and you boys are way behind!

424
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:01,416
[FATHER] Mm-hmm!

[NARRATOR] Having liberated
Chao and her village,

433
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:33,750
Goku continues his journey
for self-improvement.

434
00:22:33,833 --> 00:22:36,166
But no matter what
adventure lies ahead,

435
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:39,041
the young warrior
will never forget this day.

436
00:22:39,125 --> 00:22:42,041
It has taught him that
no weapon or adversary

437
00:22:42,125 --> 00:22:44,291
is stronger than
the human spirit.

438
00:22:44,375 --> 00:22:47,375
For true strength
comes from within...

439

Join us again for the next
exciting episode of Dragon Ball!
