[NARRATOR]
Previously on Dragon Ball:

3
00:02:15,291 --> 00:02:18,583
Goku launched a single-handed
assault on Muscle Tower

4
00:02:18,666 --> 00:02:19,833
that brought him face-to-face

5
00:02:19,916 --> 00:02:22,416
with the deadly
Major Metallitron.

6
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:27,541
This monstrous agent
of the Red Ribbon Army

7
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:29,916
fought like a
one-man killing machine

8
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,916
as he attempted to
terminate our little hero.

9
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,666
And as Goku soon discovered,

10
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,208
a machine is
exactly what he was!

11
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:41,458
That's right--
the Major was a robot!

12
00:02:41,541 --> 00:02:44,583
And with the firepower
of a small army at his disposal,

13
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:46,625
this metallic menace
kept Goku hopping

14
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:50,166
as he tried to bash, smash
and crash his way to victory.

15
00:02:51,625 --> 00:02:54,166
The situation grew more
desperate by the minute,

16
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:57,791
but as Goku prepared to fire a
final Kamehameha blast...

17
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:03,125
... the bionic bully
ran out of steam.

18
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:07,333
Hmm. Looks like someone forgot
to charge their batteries.

19
00:03:07,416 --> 00:03:09,625
Is it really over?

20
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:21,083
[MURASAKI]
Augh!

21
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:25,041
Luck is not a skill,
but this child has plenty of it.

22
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:26,166
Murasaki...

23
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,791
Eliminate this
nuisance immediately!

24
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:29,875
Aye!

25
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:37,916
The end is near, little lamb.

26
00:03:43,708 --> 00:03:46,416
[WHITE] They call him
a messenger of death;

27
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,875
swift as the wind,
and utterly lethal.

28
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:54,458
You will not see or hear him,
but he is there.

29
00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:59,500
He strikes without warning.

30
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:03,750
If you happen to catch
a glimpse of his silhouette,

31
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:06,458
then you are already dead.

32
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:14,125
Those foolish enough to
resist him pay a terrible price.

33
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:19,583
And now, little lamb,
he is coming after you.

34
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:30,833
[SUNO] Good spirits, watch
over Goku and keep him safe.

35
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:35,208
Hello? Is anybody there?

36
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:37,708
Well if you are,
I hope you're ready!

37
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:39,291
[yelling]

38
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:41,666
'Cause here I come!

39
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:49,041
Wha--What is this place?

40
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:50,666
It's so dark.

41
00:04:57,375 --> 00:04:58,666
Hey, what--

42
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:10,750
It feels like a rock...

43
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:13,458
Who put that in the
middle of the floor?!

44
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,750
[GOKU]
Is that a...

45
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:20,333
It almost looks like they've
got a whole forest in here.

46
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:23,250
Why would someone
wanna plant trees inside?

47
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:26,833
I wish there was some light
so I could see better.

48
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:29,000
Wow, this is--

49
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:30,041
Whoa!

50
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:42,875
Whoa!

51
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:51,416
Who is that?

52
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:03,458
Hey, who's there?
Show yourself!

53
00:06:18,708 --> 00:06:21,875
[MURASAKI] You are trespassing
on private property.

54
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:23,708
You are the first
person to ever reach

55
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:27,625
the fourth floor of
Muscle Tower uninvited.

56
00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:31,666
I am here to make sure
you are also the last.

57
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,666
Who are you?
And where are you?

58
00:06:40,291 --> 00:06:43,041
[MURASAKI]
I am a messenger of death.

59
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:45,958
The great ninja Murasaki.

60
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:47,666
The only time
you will see me

61
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:50,500
is just before
your final breath!

62

00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:56,250
[GOKU]
He's close. I can feel it.

64
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:57,833
But where?

65
00:06:57,916 --> 00:06:59,666
Hi-ya!

66
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:03,958
[MURASAKI]
You little brat!

67
00:07:05,708 --> 00:07:07,833
Whew! That was close!

68
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:09,625
[MURASAKI] You weren't
supposed to dodge that!

69
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:12,458
[GOKU] Okay, it's my turn!

70
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:14,000
Show yourself!

71
00:07:14,958 --> 00:07:16,375
Right now!

72
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:19,250
[MURASAKI]
You dare to challenge me?!

73
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:20,625
So be it!

74
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:44,750
[MURASAKI]
Ah, what's the matter?

75
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:47,458
You can't find me?
Try to keep up!

76
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:48,500
[MURASAKI]
Haha!

77
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:50,416
[MURASAKI]
Haha! Hoho!

Hohoho!

Hey, did you drop this?

87
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:45,833
Give that back!
Give it to me right now!

Give it! Now! Now! Now!
It's mine!

Give it--Give it back to me!
Mine! Mine!

Is that what you call
showing my sisters the sights?!

91
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:54,833
You thief!

92
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:57,583
This is my personal property!
Have you no shame?

93
00:08:57,666 --> 00:08:59,375
Are you trying to ruin me?

94

No... you can keep it.

95
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,250
Thank you...

What did you do that for?

98
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:17,791
[MURASAKI]
Ha! You think you are so clever.

99
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:18,916
Fool!

100
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,083
You have only seen
what I have allowed.

101
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:24,041
But now you shall see nothing.
I am invisible!

102
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:26,291
Yes, feel my power!

103
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:28,625
I am as transparent
as cellophane!

104
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:29,958
Tremble!

105
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:32,708
For I am as the warm wind blows,
silent but deadly!

106
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:35,166
Uhh... I see you.

107
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:38,166
[MURASAKI] Impossible!
You are delirious with fear!

108
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:40,083
[GOKU]
But you're behind the flag.

109
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:41,125
[MURASAKI] Huh?

110
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,958
I told Mother to
put the tree pattern

111
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:45,666
on both sides!

112
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:49,083
Here, you see?
Now I am invisible! Haha!

113
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:51,041
[GOKU laughs awkwardly]

114
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:52,791
It's official...

115
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:55,750
He's a complete moron.

116
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:58,083
So you saw through
my simple disguise.

117
00:09:58,166 --> 00:10:01,208
Good... Now we can get on
to more important matters.

118
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:02,583
Go to the tree and count,

119
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:05,083
and I will show you a trick
beyond your imagination.

120
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:07,958
So we're going
to play a game?

121
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:10,125
Ninjas don't play games!
Understand?

122
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:12,958
This is a highly
complicated maneuver!

123
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:14,291
What's it called?

124
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:15,916
It's... classified.

125
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,250
Go to a tree, count to 30,
and try to find me!

126
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:21,791
Okay. I guess I can do that.

Hey, what comes
after twenty-five?

Don't turn around!
Keep your eyes shut!

136
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:58,166
I am dealing
with powerful forces,

137
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:00,875
which your tiny little
mind cannot possibly fathom!

138
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:02,916
To become the rock
requires privacy!

139
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,375
That means no peeking!

Wow, is the rock empty inside?

141
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:12,125
Intolerable!

142
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:14,833
How can you hope to
comprehend the way of the Ninja

143
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:17,833
when you can't even count
past number twenty-five?!

144
00:11:17,916 --> 00:11:19,958
You are unworthy of my time!

145
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:21,291
Learn to count!

146
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:23,125
I know how to count...

147
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:25,208
I only get stuck
on that one number...

Twenty-three,
twenty-four, twenty-five...

149

Then comes twenty-six!

150
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:33,416
Good. Now save your
counting for the tree.

151
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,500
And this time, be sure
to keep your eyes closed

until you have recited
all thirty numbers!

If you forget your place,
then make something up.

00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:15,875
[GOKU] Knock-knock, open up!

165
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:28,416
[strange breathing noise]

166
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,916
Where's that coming from?

167
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:42,416
[strange breathing
noise continues]

168
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:49,916
[MURASAKI]
He'll never find me down here.

169
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,500
I am incognito.
I am like the fish.

170
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:55,833
Clever as the shark.
I am one with the water.

171
00:13:55,916 --> 00:13:57,333
Hey! Go away, frog!

172
00:13:58,541 --> 00:14:03,583
[gurgling]

173
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:18,083
[pained sputtering]

174
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:24,250
[GOKU laughing]

175
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:26,458
Tag! You're it!

176
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:27,708
What's the matter with you?!

177
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:29,708
Are you crazy?!
Just look at my tongue!

178
00:14:29,791 --> 00:14:32,708
Look what you did to me,
you savage monkey boy!

179
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:38,666
That was a dirty trick!

180
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,833
But don't worry--
I'll pay you back.

181
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:44,083
Do you want me to hide
while you count this time?

182
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:46,208
I am done with
such child's play!

183
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:48,166
Witness the ninja's speed!

184
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:54,833
Follow me, little tortoise.

185
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:56,875
Just try to
keep up with my dust!

186
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:59,041
Uh... uh...

187
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:04,416
[laughing tauntingly]

188
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,583
Oh, a race!
This'll be fun! Yipee!

189
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:21,291
You fool!

190
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:24,083
No one can match my speed!
No one!

191
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:44,041
He's getting closer!

192
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,708
Time to slow down, boy!

193
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,083
Oww! Owowow!

194
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:01,500
I guess you get
the point, huh? Ha!

195
00:16:01,583 --> 00:16:04,083
Never follow in the
footsteps of a ninja!

196
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,625
[laughing]

197
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:16,208
[MURASAKI laughing]

198
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:26,166
I'm back!

199
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:29,583
You nuisance!

200
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:47,708
[GOKU laughing smugly]

201
00:17:48,958 --> 00:17:51,041
You--You little brat!

202
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:52,958
You will suffer for this!

203
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:58,666
Moron... He is a moron...

204
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,541
Why me?

205
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:02,041
[WHITE]
Get to work, Sergeant Major!

206
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:06,666
Do your job!
Kill him! Kill him now!

207
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,916
Yes, sir.
I will not fail you.

208
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,333
The boy will die...

209
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:12,833
...immediately.

210
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:15,708
My blade will
see to that. Oho!

211
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:26,958
Now no more games.

212
00:18:28,916 --> 00:18:30,333
Okay.

213
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:38,208
Oblivion... awaits you.

214
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:39,416
Who's that?

215
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,375
Is he on the next floor?

216
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:45,041
Enough talk!

217
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:49,250
My sword, once drawn,
has never known defeat.

218
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:52,208
Can you say the same
thing about your stick?!

219
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:10,708
Here!

220
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:25,166
[pained screaming]

221
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:27,041
[pained screaming continues]

222
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:35,958
Now you have a tail!
Just like mine!

223
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:42,416
[pained screaming]

224
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,541
[pained screaming continues]

225
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:49,250
[laughing]

226
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:54,000
[screaming continues]

227
00:19:58,125 --> 00:20:01,416
[laughing]

228
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:08,333
I'm gonna need my pole back!

229
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:15,375
[incoherent babbling]

230
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:18,458
[laughing]

231
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:22,166
You... will pay
dearly... for this...

232
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:42,250
Can we break for a snack soon?

233
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:55,125
My favorite sword!

234
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:57,250
What have you done?!

235
00:20:57,333 --> 00:21:00,083
Sorry, but nothing
can beat my Power Pole.

236
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:01,416
Can we eat now?

237
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:04,458
I am unarmed.

238
00:21:04,541 --> 00:21:07,625
Will you not fight me
with your bare hands?

239
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:10,458
Okay. Sure.

240
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:13,291
[MURASAKI] What great
confidence you have in yourself.

241
00:21:18,458 --> 00:21:19,416
Wahh!

242
00:21:24,541 --> 00:21:25,958
That wasn't fair!

243
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:28,416
You said you
didn't have a weapon!

244
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,208
You really are a fool!

245
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:32,208
This is a match
of life or death.

246
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,500
Who said anything
about being fair?

247
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,875
You lied.
You're not a very nice person.

248
00:21:45,416 --> 00:21:46,625
Wahh!

249
00:21:52,791 --> 00:21:56,291
[MURASAKI]
Ohohohoho! Ahahahaha!

250
00:21:56,375 --> 00:21:58,208
Good! Well played.

251
00:21:58,291 --> 00:22:00,708
The outcome... satisfactory.

252
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:04,375
Game over! I win!

253
00:22:11,791 --> 00:22:13,500
[NARRATOR] Has the
unthinkable happened?

254
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:16,333
Has Goku fallen victim
to Murasaki's deception?

255
00:22:16,416 --> 00:22:18,041
Or is he just playing dead?

256
00:22:18,125 --> 00:22:19,416
If he is down for the count,

257
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:22,000
things don't look good
for Suno's peaceful village.

258
00:22:22,083 --> 00:22:23,875
For without Goku to stop him,

259
00:22:23,958 --> 00:22:26,416
General White can once again
use the destructive force

260
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,291
of Muscle Tower to make good

261
00:22:28,375 --> 00:22:30,875
on all of his
dastardly intentions.

262
00:22:30,958 --> 00:22:32,416
And what of
the Village Chief,

263
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,541
locked somewhere
high atop the fortress?

264
00:22:34,625 --> 00:22:35,625
Who will rescue him?

265
00:22:35,708 --> 00:22:38,208
If Goku can't do it, no one can.

266
00:22:38,291 --> 00:22:39,875
There are many
questions to be answered,

267
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:41,541
but one thing is certain:

268
00:22:41,625 --> 00:22:45,166
With our hero at the mercy of
the diabolical Red Ribbon Army,

269
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:46,541
no one is safe.

270
00:22:46,625 --> 00:22:50,458
On the next danger-filled
episode of Dragon Ball!
