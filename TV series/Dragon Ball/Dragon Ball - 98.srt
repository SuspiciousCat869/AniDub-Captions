00:02:11,541 --> 00:02:13,833
[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball...

2
00:02:13,916 --> 00:02:16,333
The 22nd World
Martial Arts Tournament

3
00:02:16,416 --> 00:02:21,041
came down to the final match:
Goku versus Tien Shinhan.

4
00:02:21,125 --> 00:02:23,583
In the beginning,
the fight was balanced.

5
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:25,458
That is, until Goku
found himself

6
00:02:25,541 --> 00:02:27,083
in a vulnerable position,

7
00:02:27,166 --> 00:02:30,958
of which Tien took full
advantage, using his Dodon Ray.

8
00:02:33,708 --> 00:02:37,041
[NARRATOR] Goku recovered and
launched into a counter-attack

9
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:39,250
using his proven
disappearing technique.

10
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:41,375
However, Tien was ready for him

11
00:02:41,458 --> 00:02:43,458
and responded with
furious force...

12
00:02:43,541 --> 00:02:45,500
Goku was defenseless
as his opponent

13
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:48,083
subjected him to a
hailstorm of punches

14
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:50,583
that left the young warrior
battered and bruised.

15
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:59,000
[NARRATOR] Goku appeared
to be down for the count.

16
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:02,500
Worse, his fate was in the hands
of his ruthless opponent.

17
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:04,625
Can Goku recover in time,

18
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:08,291
or will Tien Shinhan satisfy
his thirst for revenge

19
00:03:08,375 --> 00:03:09,541
and win the tournament?

20
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:11,833
The answer is moments away!

21
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:38,666
Don't die on me yet.
I've got a special technique

22
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:41,375
I've been saving just for you.

23
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:44,125
This could turn out
to be the shortest finale

24
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:45,791
in the tournament's
long history.

25
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:48,666
What Tien Shinhan will do
next is anyone's guess,

26
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:51,291
though I'll wager it
won't bode well for Goku.

27
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:53,625
Um, is he about
to do what I think?

28
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:57,583
[SHEN cackles] Hopefully.
It is his favorite technique.

29
00:03:57,666 --> 00:04:00,000
Aww, wake up, Goku.

30
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:03,458
Poor Goku.

31
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:05,958
He'll pull through. Don't worry.

32
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:07,375
Really?!

33
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:12,083
That looks painful.

34
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:14,958
Come on, you've got
tougher skin that that!

35
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:24,083
[cackles]

36
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:34,375
The Volleyball Technique!

37
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:38,500
[laughs]

38
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,875
It looks like Tien's
unusual technique...

39
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,333
...is exactly what it says.

40
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:55,916
He's toying with Goku
like a volleyball,

41
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,041
and setting him up for a spike!

42
00:04:58,125 --> 00:05:00,333
[yells]

43
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:02,291

[yelling continues]

45
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:09,458
Get ready... Spike!

46
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:10,958
--No!

[SHEN cackles]
Great!

51
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:37,833
[MAN] This match better last
longer than my popcorn.

52
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:42,291
[ANNOUNCER whimpers]

53
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:44,541
Is he breathing?!

54
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:45,291
Goku!

55
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:46,458
Get up.

56
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:53,166
[TIEN]
Yamcha's here. Good.

57
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:58,750
--[CROWD cheers]
--What?! No way.

58
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:01,916
Incredibly, Goku is
on his feet again!

59
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,791
Impossible!

60
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:07,833
--[KRILLIN] Oh!
--[ROSHI sighs]

61
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:15,041
Goku, don't frighten us, okay!
Next time get up sooner!

62
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:18,208
That kid's tough as nails!
Get 'em, Goku!

63
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:21,666
Well, it's nothing
short of miraculous

64
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,291
that Goku is even alive,

65
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:28,000
let alone standing, after
such brutal punishment!

66
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:29,833
That was interesting,
but I don't think

67
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:31,791
I enjoy being the ball.

68
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:36,000
Well, you're resilient.
Stupid, but resilient.

69
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:38,291
You're not very nice,
but you are strong.

70
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:39,916
I guess it would be
safe from here on out

71
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,500
if I used my full strength.

72
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:42,791
[laughs]

73
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:45,083
Let me guess...
You've been holding back

74
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:46,625
out of concern for my safety.

75
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:49,416
Yeah, but now I'll fight normal.

76
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,625
[TIEN gasps]

77
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:52,166
N-Normal!?

78
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:54,791
Does that word apply to Goku?

79
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:57,458
Whenever I fight in a match,
I have to watch myself

80
00:06:57,541 --> 00:07:01,208
so I don't get carried away.
I call it my battle strength.

81
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:05,000
I'll tell ya what...
The goal here is for you to die.

82
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:06,500
How that happens,
I really don't care.

83
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:08,708
So you have fun with your
little battle strength

84
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:10,208
and then I'll kill you.

85
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:13,416
Fine. You can try.

86
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,833
I won't have to try.
It's too easy.

87
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:20,166
What? Eh, get ready.
Here comes round two.

88
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:26,791

[GOKU]
Ka...

93
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,041
--Wow, Goku is on a roll
--[GOKU] Me...

94
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:54,000
as he prepares to dazzle us
with his Kamehameha Wave,

95
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:57,708
the signature technique of
the Turtle Hermit school.

96
00:07:57,791 --> 00:08:00,875
Ha...

97
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:03,291
Me...

98
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:10,333
Hold on.

99
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:14,791
In a bizarre shift in strategy,

100
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:16,958
Goku has withdrawn
his technique,

101
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:19,875
giving Tien Shinhan
time to recover.

102
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:23,625
This may well go down as the
turning point in the battle.

103
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:29,791
[KRILLIN, ROSHI gasp]

104

[TIEN groaning]

105
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:39,416
That's what I call
battle strength.

106
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:45,458
[laughs]

107
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:50,166
Thank you. That was the
most exhilarating rush...

108
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:56,750
I haven't felt this alive in a
long time. It feels wonderful!

109
00:08:56,833 --> 00:09:00,458
So, what you're saying is
you like getting beat up?

110
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:02,875
I don't get it.
Why would Goku pass up

111
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:04,791
the perfect opportunity
to defeat him?

112
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:06,541
It just doesn't make any sense.

113
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:12,458
[YAMCHA] Goku had
a good reason... I hope.

114
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:13,791
[gasps]

115
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:17,250
Finally we have an
interesting battle.

116
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:19,291
Tien is an excellent opponent.

117
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:20,375
[PUAR, OOLONG]
What!?

118
00:09:47,916 --> 00:09:53,000
All right, I've indulged you
long enough. It's time to pay.

119
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:54,916
I don't think so.

120
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,166
Tension in the ring is high...

121
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,708
Despite the extraordinary
toll this fight has taken

122
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:01,041
on its opponents,

123
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:04,083
neither seems to be showing
any sign of fatigue.

124
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:09,166
Boy, Goku made a huge mistake
by stopping his Kamehameha Wave.

125
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:13,083
Did he really? Look closer.

126
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:14,375
There is a very fine line

127
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:18,166
that distinguishes
ineptitude from strategy.

128
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,958
Huh?

129
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:23,625
[ROSHI] If Goku had followed
through with his plan,

130
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:25,916
Tien Shinhan would
have dodged the wave...

131
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,291
Goku would have wasted energy
and left himself vulnerable.

132
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:34,208
You're great, Tien.

133
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:35,750
[cackles]

134
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:40,250
Tien has that look in his eye.
Nothing can save Goku now!

135
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:47,166
[yells]

136
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:10,916
[KRILLIN]
Oh! Wow!

137
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:15,875
Rarely have we seen
fighters display

138
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:18,791
such an unrelenting fury!

139
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:22,875
Goku and Tien Shinhan are taking
this fight to a whole new level.

140
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:25,125
Everything is to the extreme.

141
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:27,916
Why, if an ordinary man was
to be on the receiving end

142
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,250
of one of those punches,

143
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:31,708
he'd probably never wake up!

144
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:41,916
Watch Goku... His breathing.

145
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,041
Uh, what?

146
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:46,041
It's calm.
Throughout that exertion

147
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:48,833
he never lost his breath once.

148
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:55,166
Oh...

149
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:09,041
All eyes are glued to the fight,
and one can't help but wonder...

150
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:11,833
What awesome technique
will we see next?

151
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:50,791
[GOKU]
Hm?

152
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:53,041
[yells]

153
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:04,375
[KRILLIN] They're fighting
so fast, it's like a blur.

154
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:08,083
[ROSHI]
Maybe you need glasses.

155
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:19,458
The pace at which these two
are fighting is staggering.

156
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:22,291
This may be the world's
record for speed combat!

157
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:25,291
It's a good thing there aren't
any rules inside the ring.

158
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,583
I don't think our judges
could see clearly enough

159
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:29,291
to enforce them!

160
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:35,833
Give him a left, Goku!
Now a right!

161
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:38,791
--Yeah! That's it! Clobber him!
--[OOLONG grunting] Ow! Ah!

162
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:41,125
[ANNOUNCER] Goku has taken
command of the fight

163
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:43,125
with an explosive offensive!

164
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:47,125
He's pushing Tien to the edge of
the ring. There's no more room!

165
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:00,541
Haaa!

166
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:09,625
Yeah! Pin him down, Goku! Huh?

167
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:16,083
What a rebound!
Tien Shinhan deftly avoided

168
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:17,625
expulsion from the ring

169
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:21,583
and has taken a decisive lead
in his bid to overtake Goku!

170
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:45,166
Don't stop. Keep punching!

171
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:47,208
[ANNOUNCER] That's what I
call a divided offense!

172
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:54,708
Goku has split into... 1, 2,
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9... 10 Gokus!

173
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:07,666
You whelp. I can't be fooled
by optical illusions.

174
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,666
But you'll learn.

Easy, Bulma.

00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:22,250
[ANNOUNCER] Spectacular! I don't
think a single person here

189
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:23,625
would label that stunt as

190
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:25,875
anything less than
extraordinary!

191
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:28,458
Goku's success with the
Mirror-Image Technique

192
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:30,958
has left Tien face down!

193

time for everything.

He's tough.

201
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:03,125
Fools, Tien would never
go down that easy.

202
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:07,375
You idiot! You think
your infantile abilities

203
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:09,875
can defeat me? Me?!

204
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:12,958
You're hardly even a challenge!

205
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:14,500
I don't know. It looked like

206
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:16,833
you were having to
fight pretty hard.

Goku should be seeing stars
right about now, but the blast

223

looks to have had
no effect on him.

224

In fact, it's Tien who
looks out of sorts.

[ANNOUNCER] Tien has collapsed!
It seems all but certain

231
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:03,666
that Goku will be
claiming this match!

[ROSHI] Hey! What happened?!
Where did my--

234
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:14,625
--[ANNOUNCER] One...
--But I don't understand...

235
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:15,875
How could Goku even

236
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:17,291
--[ANNOUNCER] Two...
--see Tien to fight?

237
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:20,125
--Three...
--How am I supposed to know?

238
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:23,416
--Four...
--What happened, Yamcha?

239
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,958
He improvised.

240
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,208
[YAMCHA] He knew the
Sun Technique would have

241
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:31,041
the same blinding effect
that it did on Jacky Chun,

242
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:34,333
so he borrowed
Master Roshi's sunglasses.

243
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:37,583
The tinted lenses allowed him
to see Tien's approach.

244
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:39,875
Therefore, it was easy
for Goku to track

245
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:42,583
Tien's movements and
block his assault.

246

Wow...

get it right this time.

I'd get on that stage

264
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:54,250
and ring your
little neck myself!

giving up for you or anybody!

without your glasses before.

271

[ROSHI]
What difference does it make?

272
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:27,375
None. It's just your
eyes look familiar.

273
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:30,375
As if I've seen them
somewhere before.

274
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:34,458
U-Uh, yes. I-I get that a lot.

If you focused your attention on
the match instead of my eyes,

before it's too late?
