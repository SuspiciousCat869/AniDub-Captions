00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:14,500
[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball,

2
00:02:14,583 --> 00:02:18,666
Goku flew into a blind rage
upon meeting the mystical Kami,

3
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,625
mistaking him for
the villianous Piccolo.

4
00:02:20,708 --> 00:02:22,333
[GOKU] I should've known
that you were still alive,

5
00:02:22,416 --> 00:02:23,791
you big monster!

6
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:28,625
[GOKU groans]

7
00:02:28,708 --> 00:02:30,166
It is you who
fails to understand.

8
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,666
--This is not Piccolo.
--Let go of me!

9
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,625
[GOKU growls, gasps]

10
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:37,833
What do you mean?

11
00:02:37,916 --> 00:02:40,833
There's a good reason
you mistook me for Piccolo.

12
00:02:40,916 --> 00:02:44,458
My name is Kami, and I am indeed
the guardian of this planet,

13
00:02:44,541 --> 00:02:48,333
but it wasn't always that way.

14
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:51,041
I remained at the Lookout
and became the next Guardian.

15
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:53,666
Piccolo went down to
Earth to incite disorder...

16
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,583
[NARRATOR]
Goku's fears were put to rest.

17
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:57,875
Kami agreed to
grant Goku's wish,

18
00:02:57,958 --> 00:03:01,500
on the condition that he train
at the Lookout for three years.

19
00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:05,166
[KAMI] Unfortunately, my powers
will not bring them back.

20
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,791
Uh... Uhh...

21
00:03:06,875 --> 00:03:10,500
The one being that has that
ability is Shenron, the Dragon.

22
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:12,625
I guess I'll just have to
recreate him,

23
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:16,250
and let Earthlings use
the Dragon Balls again.

24
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:18,791
You can really do that, Kami?

25
00:03:37,916 --> 00:03:41,041
[FISHERMAN] You gonna hog the
bathroom all morning, Ahab?

26
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:45,875
[grunts]

27
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:48,500
[FISHERMAN]
Well, at least the sun's out.

28
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,875
[yawns]

29
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:01,916
[gasps]

30
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:12,833
[AHAB]
What is that thing?!

31
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:15,541
[BOTH whimper]

32
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:40,333
[BOTH gasp]

33
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:57,250
[BOTH scream]

34
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:16,333
[KAMI] Well, Goku, it's time for
me to make good on my promise.

35
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:18,791
Mr. Popo, please
fetch the Eternal Dragon.

36
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:20,250
[POPO]
Right away.

37
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:24,833
Listen, Goku,
you must understand.

38
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:27,958
Once the dragon's alive,
this is out of my hands.

39
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:30,208
[GOKU]
Mm-hmm!

40
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:31,666
[POPO]
Here it is.

41
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:42,541
[GOKU]
Wha...?

42
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:50,000
Ah. I didn't realize he was
this badly damaged, Mr. Popo.

43
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:52,458
Is it possible to fix him?

44
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:54,000
Yes, it's easy.

45
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:16,541
Is that really
the Eternal Dragon?

46
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:19,375
Not exactly. No, not yet.

47
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:22,666
You see, Mr. Goku, Kami must
first breathe life into it.

48
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:25,166
It's my job.
But when he was destroyed,

49
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:28,916
I had decided not to
bring the dragon back.

50
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,958
When I first created
the Dragon Balls,

51
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:33,625
I did so in order to
encourage acts of bravery

52
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:36,541
and give the people of
Earth a sense of hope.

53
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:38,625
But I soon learned that
the hearts of man

54
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:40,250
are easily corrupted.

55
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,041
People began killing one another

56
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:43,916
in order to attain
the Dragon Balls.

57
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,416
Their greed and lust for power
turned my noble, pure endeavor

58
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,541
into one of evil.

59
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:52,041
However...

60
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:54,541
You've changed my mind, Goku.

61
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:56,916
I was beginning to believe
that all people

62
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,416
were greedy and
dishonorable, but,

63
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,333
you've shown me that there are
people

64
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:04,500
that have kind and
untainted minds and hearts.

65
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:07,291
[YAJIROBE]
Hello up there!

66
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:13,500
[KORIN chuckles]

67
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:15,416
--[KORIN yells]
--[YAJIROBE screams]

68
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:19,541
[YAJIROBE]
What are you doing?!

69
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:21,875
I was about to
ask you the same thing.

70
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:24,416
You seem a little jumpy.
You worried about Goku?

71
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,583
Don't be ridiculous.

72
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:28,166
I just thought
I'd keep an eye out for him

73
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:32,083
in case he fell down from
that Guardian Lookout, okay?

74
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:33,625
Right...

75
00:07:33,708 --> 00:07:37,208
You can't fool me. I know you're
a just big softy underneath.

76
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:40,208
Go away! You're
makin' my head hurt!

77
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:44,416
[YAJIROBE]
Hmm?

78
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:47,500
Yajirobe, what is wrong
with your stomach?

79
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:51,583
Uh, I... I think I over
did it at lunch today.

80
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:53,041
[KORIN laughs]

81
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:56,875
Oh, you did, huh? For some
reason I don't believe you.

82
00:07:56,958 --> 00:07:58,208
--[YAJIROBE] S-Stop it!
--[KORIN] Come here!

83
00:07:58,291 --> 00:07:59,916
What are you
hiding under there, huh?

84
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:02,500
[KORIN]
Ah-ha!

85
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:10,958
[YAJIROBE whimpers]

86
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:15,041
Senzus?

87
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:22,708
Didn't you learn your lesson
the last time this happened?

88
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:26,333
Bite me, fur-ball!
You're just being stingy.

89
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:29,750
You'll never get on the
Nimbus behaving that way.

90
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:31,541
You don't know that! I might!

91
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:33,541
I'll ride it someday!
You just wait!

92
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:36,000
Don't hold your breath, okay?!

93
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:37,458
I'll hold it if I want to!

94
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:40,625
[KORIN]
Hmph!

95
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:50,583
Done.

96
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:52,208
[GOKU laughs]

97
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,750
Stand back, please.

98
00:08:57,833 --> 00:08:59,208
[POPO]
All right.

99
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:01,875
[POPO]
You, too, Goku.

100
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:45,208
[yells]

101
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:49,125
[screams]

102
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:00,583
Wait! Where is he going?!

103
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:03,250
He is searching for
the Dragon Balls.

104
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:05,500
Typically, they must
remain in their stone form

105
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:07,833
for a full year before the
dragon can be summoned

106
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:10,333
to grant a wish, but
this time I've decided to

107
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:13,208
make an exception for you
and your friends, Goku.

108
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:14,666
Really?

109
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:18,583
[GOKU] Do you think I could go
and watch my friends

110
00:10:18,666 --> 00:10:20,291
come back to life?

111
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:22,375
Don't tell me you've already
forgotten your promise

112
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:24,541
to remain here at the
Lookout and train?

113
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:26,000
Oh, that's right.

114
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:28,083
You'll stay for three years.

115
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:30,125
Then you'll be able to
see your friends again

116
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:31,708
at the next tournament.

117
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:35,833
You know about the tournament?
Are you a psychic or something?

118
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:37,791
There's something
you should know, Goku.

119
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:41,291
Piccolo will be coming to
the tournament to challenge you.

120
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:42,958
So you must be prepared.

121
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:47,833
Piccolo? I thought I killed him!
Are you sure he's alive?!

122
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:51,208
Unfortunately, I am.

123
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:53,250
Moments before Piccolo died,

124
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:55,958
he created an egg
that contained a child,

125
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:58,958
a virtually identical
replica of Piccolo,

126
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:01,041
possessing his powers,
his brain,

127
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:03,541
and his tendencies for evil.

128
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:05,583
The child is growing
as we speak.

129
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:08,958
In three years time, he'll be
strong enough to face you again.

130
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:12,875
I don't believe it!

131
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:16,000
As long as you are here, Piccolo
won't be able to attack you.

132
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:18,500
That way you can train
for the next three years

133
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:20,000
without any disturbances.

134
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:23,791
Then, you'll be strong enough
to defeat him, perhaps.

135
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:26,250
I am prevented from
destroying Piccolo myself

136
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:28,458
in light of a
minor technicality.

137
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:30,458
The fate of the Earth
rests in your hands

138
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:33,750
because you are the only
person capable of defeating him.

139
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:34,916
Understand?

140
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,125
I... I understand.

141
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:39,500
Can you promise me that, Goku?

142
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:41,833
[GOKU]
I won't let you down, Kami!

143
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:45,166
Let's get started!
I'm totally focused now!

144
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:47,791
[GOKU growls]

145
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:49,250
Haah!

146
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:53,750
[GOKU] Um, but first, I have
to pee. Where's the bathroom?

147
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:55,208
[BOTH gasp]

148
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,125
Down the hall,
first door on your left.

149
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:00,625
[GOKU yells]

150
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:03,250
[GOKU] Gotta go, gotta go!
I-I don't know if I can hold it!

151
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,208
Uh, Kami? You and Piccolo
are one entity, right?

152
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:18,000
So if Goku kills him, he will,
um, I guess, kill you as well?

153
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:19,750
That is correct.

154
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:22,625
I have brought all
of this on myself.

155
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:24,666
I must now answer for it.

156
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:30,916
No entity can strangle
himself with his own hand,

157
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,541
but I have finally found
a way to rid the world

158
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:35,708
of the horrors I have caused.

159
00:12:35,791 --> 00:12:38,000
I know this won't
be easy, Mr. Popo,

160
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:39,833
but you must carry on without me

161
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:42,666
until another
guardian can be found.

162
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:45,416
I'm feeling very... perplexed.

Well, don't work too hard.

164

We still have three years before
the next tournament, you know.

Yes, I know.

We thought you'd been
destroyed, Mr. Dragon.

200
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:02,708
Kami saw that Goku's
purpose was noble.

201
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:06,375
And so, he chose
to resurrect me.

If I faint, catch me.

Where is Goku?

00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:14,375
Kami has chosen Goku
for an important task,

205
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:17,583
and he is now training
at the Lookout.

where he's at right now.

We're not positive,

but the Eternal Dragon said he
was training at Kami's Lookout.

I don't like going off
of hearsay,

Mm-hm.

It's true. Goku is something
very different from you and I,

272
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:06,583
and Kami's obviously
recognized it.

To be honest, I'm chopped liver

in comparison to that

He's a kid and he's already
surpassing us in strength.

Now that he's
training with Kami,

we'll never catch up with him.

to train twice as hard,

twice as fast, and twice as long
