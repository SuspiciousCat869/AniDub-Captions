[NARRATOR] Previously

[GOKU] Hey, are
you listening?

3
00:02:17,291 --> 00:02:19,458
[NARRATOR] Goku's first
visit to the frozen tundra

4
00:02:19,541 --> 00:02:22,291
took a nasty turn as
his airplane nose-dived

5
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:24,750
into the thick snow below...

6
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,083
[NARRATOR] In this
unforgiving weather

7
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:33,083
and with the Red Ribbon Army
close at hand,

8
00:02:33,166 --> 00:02:35,541
Goku would have been
a goner without the help

9
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:37,625
of a young girl named Suno,

10
00:02:37,708 --> 00:02:39,875
who pulled our hero
by the heels

11
00:02:39,958 --> 00:02:41,750
through the frozen wilderness,

12
00:02:41,833 --> 00:02:46,416
toward the safety
of her nearby village.

13
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,750
You imbecile!

14
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:49,250
Stop wasting
my time and follow

15
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:51,708
that trail before
the snow covers it up!

16
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:54,750
[NARRATOR] General White's
troops widened their search,

17
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:57,708
their every resource
dedicated to finding Goku

18
00:02:57,791 --> 00:02:59,958
and the Dragon Ball he carries.

19
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:03,333
But the falling snow served to
hinder the soldiers' progress,

20
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:05,583
and gave Goku
some much needed time

21
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:08,166
to recover from
his latest ordeal...

22
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:09,666
[GOKU snoring]

23
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:12,208
[NARRATOR] Suno and her mother
placed the unconscious boy

24
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:13,500
in front of a warm fire,

25
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:16,166
and did what else
they could to thaw him out.

26
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:18,291
Fortunately, they
didn't have to wait long

27
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:21,416
before their kind
efforts were rewarded.

28
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,458
[GOKU groans]

29
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:23,875
[SUNO gasps] I think
he's waking up!

30
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:25,583
[NARRATOR] And with the addition
of some extra clothes...

31
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:27,291
[GOKU giggles]
This feels great!

32
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:29,041
[NARRATOR] Goku was
soon back on his feet

33
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:30,916
and feeling better than ever.

34
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,125
[GOKU chuckles]
Don't worry about me...

35
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:34,625
I'll be fine.

36
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:36,750
[NARRATOR]
His energy fully restored,

37
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:40,208
Goku raced away from
Suno's house on a new mission.

38
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:44,500
Do you really think he can
defeat the army, Mother?

39
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:47,541
He thinks he can,
but so did your father.

40
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,625
[NARRATOR]
To show his thanks,

41
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:52,875
Goku promised to
rescue the village chief...

42
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:55,916
who is being held hostage
by the Red Ribbon Army

43
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,583
in their heavily
fortified Muscle Tower.

44
00:03:58,666 --> 00:04:00,458
[GOKU yelling]

45

Power Pole extend!

47
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,958
[NARRATOR] Goku easily swept
aside the first wave of guards

48
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:14,458
and vaulted his way
onto the tower,

49
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:16,791
ready to face
the many dangers ahead.

50
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:17,833
Little does he know,

51
00:04:17,916 --> 00:04:19,958
General White is
also ready for him.

52
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:21,416
[GOKU]
Hmm?

53
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:25,375
Well, I am impressed,
little lamb...

54
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:26,791
Come on up.

55
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:29,125
[WHITE] I'll be right
here waiting for you.

56
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:31,625
[WHITE laughs]

57

Come inside...

You'll catch
your death out here.

59
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:55,291
I was just hoping
I'd see Goku...

60
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:18,041
This place is huge.

61
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:19,791
The chief could be anywhere.

62
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:21,833
[WHITE]
I see you, intruder!

63

[GOKU]
Hmm?

64
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:25,125

[GOKU]
Huh?

67
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:32,041
Where are you?
I can't see you!

68
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:33,625
What's it to you?

69
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:34,791
You're the trespasser!

70

What do you want?

71
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:39,166
[GOKU] I came to take
the chief back to his village!

72
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:42,958
The chief? I see...

73
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:45,833
You've been sent here
to retrieve him, have you?

74
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:48,083
[WHITE] Well by all means,
come and get him.

75
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:50,458
Take the stairs all the way
to the top floor.

76
00:05:50,541 --> 00:05:53,333
You'll find him there.

77
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:57,875
Ah, just be sure to watch
your step on the way up.

78

Look, a kid!

You startled us, boy!

And we hate to be startled...

General White, sir!

Want me to teach
this kid a lesson?

[WHITE] Yes. Education
is very important.

Don't kill him too quick!

Yeah, it's important to
learn about sharing, kid.

how he was able

I've had it with this fight!

331
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:30,250
[GOKU yelling]

332
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:36,083
[electricity fizzles]

333
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:40,416
[GOKU giggles]

334
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,375
[MAJOR METALLITRON]
Destroy.

335
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:46,208
Ugh, this guy is annoying me!

336
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:47,416
[GOKU growls]

337
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:50,416
[MAJOR METALLITRON]
Destroy...

338
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:54,625
Ka... me...

339
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:57,458
...ha...

340
00:20:57,541 --> 00:20:59,666
...me...

341
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:01,541
[MAJOR METALLITRON
powering down]

342
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:03,333
Ha--uh??!

343
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:08,541
[GOKU]
Uh...

344
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:10,000
Huh?

345
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:19,958
Hiyah! Yah! Yah!

346
00:21:20,041 --> 00:21:21,458
Uh... 

347
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:23,333
Is it really over?

348
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:28,625
Get up, fool!

349
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:30,125
Get up!

350
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:33,166
Uh, I think his batteries
may have run out of juice.

351
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,208
His batteries?!

352
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:36,375
Well, I remember

353
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:39,041
they were changed
last spring sometime...

354
00:21:39,541 --> 00:21:40,791
What a tough fight!

355
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:43,291
I hope there aren't any
more like him around here!

356
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:49,708
Hmmm...

357
00:21:49,791 --> 00:21:52,333
It seems we
underestimated this boy.

358
00:21:52,416 --> 00:21:53,750
Why are you still here?

359
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:56,416
Get to the fourth floor
and defend it!

360
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:08,125
[NARRATOR] Goku may have
beaten Major Metallitron,

361
00:22:08,208 --> 00:22:09,583
but there's still
a long way to go

362
00:22:09,666 --> 00:22:12,750
before he reaches
the top of the tower

363
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:14,958
and General White is
making sure there's plenty

364
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:17,041
to stand in his way!

365
00:22:17,958 --> 00:22:21,291
Watch out, Goku!
Ninja Murasaki is coming!

366
00:22:29,708 --> 00:22:30,666
[NARRATOR]
Back at the village,

367
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:33,166
as the air outside
fills with snow,

368
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:35,333
the air inside is
filled with worry!

369
00:22:35,416 --> 00:22:37,541
Suno and her mother
hope against hope

370
00:22:37,625 --> 00:22:39,958
that Goku will be
the first person to challenge

371
00:22:40,041 --> 00:22:44,666
the Red Ribbon Army and escape
from Muscle Tower alive.

372
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:46,541
Can our hero possibly survive?

373
00:22:46,625 --> 00:22:50,750
