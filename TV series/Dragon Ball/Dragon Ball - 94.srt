[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball,

2
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,583
the tournament
semi-finals began

3
00:02:16,666 --> 00:02:19,416
as Jackie Chun
battled Tien Shinhan.

4
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,416
Confident the
mirror-image technique

5
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,125
would stop his adversary,

6
00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:25,958
Jackie overlooked
Tien's incredible sight

7
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:28,708
and paid the price.

8
00:02:28,791 --> 00:02:31,375
Fortunately,
Jackie Chun decided to take

9
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:32,958
a more hands-on approach.

10
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:35,583
What followed was
the most ferocious fight

11
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:39,000
the tournament
had seen in years.

12
00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:40,791
[TIEN grunts]

13
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:44,166
[NARRATOR] Which took
its toll on the combatants.

14
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,375
[TIEN] It makes no sense
that an old man should be

15
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:48,125
so agile and skillful.

16
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:49,500
Whoever he is,
he's more powerful

17
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:51,041
than anyone I've ever faced.

18
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:52,333
[CHUN]
He's just a kid,

19
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:54,333
but he's taken everything
I've thrown at him,

20
00:02:54,416 --> 00:02:56,750
and keeps coming back for more!

[YAMCHA]
Nothing but noise!

23
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,291
Man, I'd give anything
to be able to see the fight.

24
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:47,083

It's not exactly
the front row,

31
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:09,500
but it beats the window.

...trading punch for punch!

The only word to describe
this fight is severe!

36
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:30,333
Jackie Chun and
Tien Shinhan are embroiled

37
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:31,833
in what could be...

38
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:34,458
[YAMCHA] Even Jackie Chun is
having trouble beating Tien.

39
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:36,666
Is this guy human?!

40

Just don't get too excited
and jump out of the bed!

they're both good.

Never upset your elders!

Jackie Chun is one step
from falling out of the ring!

Tien Shinhan needs only to
move him a few inches further!

You are one of the most gifted

00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:06,083
Listen to my words, Tien.

167
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:10,250
The truth is always upsetting
when you choose to live a lie.

168
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:12,416
No! You're just
trying to confuse me!

169
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,083
I won't listen to
the ravings of a lunatic!

[SHEN]
Mmm...

00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:49,541
What are you hiding... Jackie?

[TIEN chuckles]

175

Careful, my boy. You run
the risk of getting sloppy.

176
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:23,666
That last charge was weak,
even for you.

177
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:26,500
It was enough to catch
you off guard, old man!

178
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:30,583
But not to defeat me. And that
is your objective, isn't it?

179
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:33,458
You are not focussed on
the present, the here and now.

180

Your mind is
scattered like dust.

181

I don't understand why Jackie
is still talking to him.

182
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:43,500
Do you think maybe he's too
tired to continue fighting?

183
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:45,500
No! Are you crazy?!

184
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:48,583
Jackie Chun doesn't
get tired. He's invincible!

185
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:50,208
This is all part of his plan!

[GOKU]
You think so?

[KRILLIN]
I know so!

188
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:58,458
Oh... I guess that
makes sense... sort of.

189
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:02,833
All of your values have
been tainted and jaded.

[TIEN grunts]

It's not your fault, really.

The Crane Hermit has always
excelled at deception.

[SHEN] Hear my thoughts,
Jackie Chun.

You are surrounded
by fans that adore you.

They're speaking to you.

Gotcha! I knew it was you
all along, you faker!

[SHEN] Tien Shinhan! Don't be
fooled by that troublemaker.

Hm?

Did you really think that

You--You know who I am?

All right, yes.
I'm Master Roshi.

Uh.

But my identity doesn't make
my words any less true.

Don't throw away your ability
by giving in to Shen!

You're young. There's still
time to change your course!

Enough! Your lectures
are meaningless to me!

I wonder what they're saying.

It's probably
just a distraction.

It makes no difference
to me who you are. Hm!

I've got the perfect weapon.

In a strange role-reversal,
Crane alumni Tien Shinhan

00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:53,541
used a signature move
of the Turtle School,

so easy to you.
