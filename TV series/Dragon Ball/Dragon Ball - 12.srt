1
00:02:18,541 --> 00:02:21,833
[NARRATOR] Previously on Dragon
Ball, Emperor Pilaf succeeded in

2
00:02:21,916 --> 00:02:25,125
uniting the seven magic
Dragon Balls, and now prepares

3
00:02:25,208 --> 00:02:28,458
to summon the Eternal
Dragon to grant his wish

4
00:02:28,541 --> 00:02:30,708
to rule the world.

5
00:02:35,083 --> 00:02:36,666
Come forth, Dragon!

6
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:39,333
I call upon you
to grant my wish!

7
00:02:42,833 --> 00:02:45,250
[NARRATOR] Little does the
Emperor know, two of our heroes

8
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:49,000
have taken flight in an attempt
to thwart his diabolical plans.

9
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:51,916
[PUAR] Come on, Oolong!
We have to hurry!

10
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:53,958
[OOLONG] How fast do
you think a pig can fly?

11
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:56,708
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile, the rest
of the team watches helplessly

12
00:02:56,791 --> 00:03:00,416
from above, trapped within the
confines of their prison cell.

13
00:03:02,958 --> 00:03:06,041
C'mon, Puar!
You're our only hope now!

14
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:07,791
You can do it, Oolong!

15
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:09,458
[GOKU] What's
going on, you guys?!

16
00:03:09,541 --> 00:03:10,916
I can't see!

17
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:16,500
Eternal Dragon!

18
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:22,250
Arise!

19
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:45,166
[NARRATOR] At last, the Eternal
Dragon has risen from its

20
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:49,458
slumber within the fiery core of
the Earth. And It seems nothing

21
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:51,416
can prevent Emperor
Pilaf from fulfilling

22
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,416
his desire for world domination!

23
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,250
[NARRATOR] Hurry, Oolong!
Hurry, Puar!

24
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:58,125
The fate of the
world is in your hands!

25
00:04:10,916 --> 00:04:13,916
We're too late, Oolong.
The dragon's already here!

26
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,583
Now what are we going to do?!

27
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:17,750
We can't just stand
here and watch!

28
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:19,916
Oh, we have no choice!

29
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,625
Hey, let me see!

30
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,750
I can't believe it...

31
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:31,875
It's the most beautiful
thing I've ever seen!

32
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:43,250
[PILAF] At last, my greatest
dreams are finally coming true!

33
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:48,375
Soon the whole world
will be at my beck and call!

34
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:56,208
[laughing]

35
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:05,500
[cheering]

36
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:15,541
[laughing]

37
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:25,541
[laughing]

38
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:32,666
[laughing]

39
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:47,333
[whimpering]

40
00:05:47,416 --> 00:05:50,208
[GOKU] Wow, he's huge!

41
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:54,666
[DRAGON] Who has summoned me?

42
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:59,208
Uh, that would be me. I did.

43
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:02,291
Tell me your wish.

44
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:06,458
[DRAGON] But beware,
for it will come true.

45
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:12,666
We've got to do something!

46
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:15,166
We can't just let the
whole world go to ruin!

47
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:19,041
[DRAGON] Speak!

48
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:23,250
Do something, you stupid pig!

49
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:25,291
I hope he ate already!

50
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,375
Alright, then. I'm ready.

51
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:35,166
Whoa, this is it guys!
He's about to make his wish!

52
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:37,500
[YAMCHA] Now I'll
never get a date!

53
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:38,958
[BULMA] My boyfriend!

54
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:41,500
[PILAF] Uh, I wish for, uh...

55
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:49,125
Ka-me-ha-me-ha!

56
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:55,625
[GOKU] Darn, that didn't work!
Kamehamehas make me hungry...

57
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:58,291
But, I'm not gonna give up yet!

58
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:03,375
Ka-me-ha--!

59
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:06,041
[DRAGON] You try my patience!

60
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,250
I'm sorry!

61
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:12,083
It just that I've
never done this before...

62
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:15,166
[DRAGON] Make a wish!

63
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:17,166
[DRAGON] Now!

64
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:19,791
[PILAF] Yes, of course!

65
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:22,125
[PILAF] My wish... how
silly of me... my wish!

66
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:24,250
I'm a coward!
I don't want to be a hero!

67
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:26,208
I don't want to save
the day! This stinks!

68
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:28,666
And these boxers are chafing!

69
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:31,666
Uh... I would
like to have supreme...

70
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:36,458
...me-ha!

71
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:40,458
I want to have the world--

72
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:43,708
[OOLONG] The world's most
comfortable pair of ultra-soft--

73
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:47,916
underwear!

74
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:15,916
Huh?

75
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,291
[snickering]

76
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:19,791
I think that little
pervert just saved the world!

77
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:22,791
Maybe he's not such
a coward after all!

78
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:25,041
You dolt!

79
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,791
[DRAGON] Your wish
has been granted.

80
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:58,583
[whimpering]

81
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:01,958
All of the Dragon
Balls just flew away!

82
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,583
That's what happens when
the dragon grants a wish.

83
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:06,875
The balls are spread
all over the earth again.

84
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:10,291
What? That means the
Dragon Ball Grandpa gave me

85
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:12,333
to remember him by is gone!

86
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,291
[snickering]

87
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:16,750
[PILAF] Seize him!

88
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:19,291
I want that
pig for dinner!

89
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,250
[PILAF] The others
have escaped too!

90
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:26,416
I want them all!

91
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,083
Exterminate! Exterminate!

92
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:30,541
[OOLONG] Hey, let's go, Puar!

93
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:33,500
We can take those two!

94
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:38,125
[guns firing]

95
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:39,583
Or not!

96
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:41,500
Goku?!

97
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:43,000
[BULMA] What are you doing?

98
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,083
I'm too hungry
to go anywhere.

99
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:47,333
[BULMA] You're too hungry?!

100
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,208
You're gonna be too
dead to go anywhere if

101
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:51,666
you don't move it! C'mon!

102
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:57,208
Shu, they're heading
toward the north face!

103
00:09:57,291 --> 00:09:58,791
I'll call my dog police!

104
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:39,208
We've gotta find
Yamcha and the others.

105
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:41,000
You wanna find
those whiney goofballs,

106
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:45,125
go right ahead. I've already
saved the world once today.

107
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:47,791
I feel like I've
done my civic duty.

108
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:49,500
You mean you're
just going to leave your

109
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:51,125
two friends behind?!

110
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:58,333
Let's get outta here!

111
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:04,958
Try thinking
positive for a change!

112
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:07,666
And run faster,
you're falling behind!

113
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:12,250
Think positive, huh?!

114
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:13,708
Fine, it doesn't work.

115
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:19,958
Snap out of it, Goku!

116
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:21,416
I'm too hungry...

117
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:24,916
Here they come!

118
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:28,125
[YAMCHA] Dinner time, Goku!

119
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:38,583
Yum-yum!

120
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,916
Looks like I'm
on clean-up duty.

121
00:11:57,875 --> 00:11:59,791
Wolf Fang Fist!

122
00:12:08,666 --> 00:12:09,750
C'mon!

123
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:11,000
Let's get out of
this stinkin' dog kennel!

124
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,541
Power Pole, extend!

125
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,875
They're... they're...
they're gaining on us!

126
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:10,541
Don't worry, I'm
an expert at running away!

127
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:16,083
Power Pole, extend!

128
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,791
All right, so
maybe it wasn't graceful, but

129
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:22,958
at least I got us
away from the dogs.

130
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:24,375
You know, we could
just change into

131
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:25,875
birds and fly out of here.

132
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,208
This is just great, Goku!

133
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:34,291
So how do you think we're going
to get over to that window, huh?

134
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:35,041
I dunno.

135
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:36,250
Now he tells us!

136
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:39,583
You ready, Puar?

137
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:41,041
Okay, let's go!

138
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:50,166
[screaming]

139
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:55,125
Ow, now that smarts!

140
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:56,500
Oh, great, more dogs!

141
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,958
I need some food, bad.

142
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,750
[MAI and SHU] Attack!

143
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:11,541
[SHU] Alright, drop that mutt!

144
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:15,416
[BULMA] Yamcha?

145
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:21,750
[growling]

146
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:33,250
[maniacal laughter]

147
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:47,083
I bet even Goku can't
blast a hole this time!

148
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:48,833
It's made of some weird metal.

149
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:53,375
No big deal. Look!
There's no ceiling!

150
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:57,875
Yes there is.
It's probably made of glass.

151
00:14:57,958 --> 00:15:00,333
It can't be
harder than my head.

152
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:01,791
Just watch this!

153
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:13,875
And from the looks
of it--tempered glass.

154
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:19,875
Well, I'm not giving up.
First, we're gonna get out

155
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:23,125
of here, then we're gonna find
all seven Dragon Balls again.

156
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:27,208
There won't be any
Dragon Balls for a year.

157
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:28,666
What do you mean?!

158
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:30,958
Yeah, what gives?

159
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:34,833
It's all part of the legend.
Once the Eternal Dragon grants

160
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:37,541
a wish and the Dragon
Balls are scattered across the

161
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:40,958
earth again, they become inert
for a full year. In other words,

162
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:43,250
you won't even be able to
tell they're Dragon Balls.

163
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:45,291
They'll just look
like round stones...

164
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:48,708
Are... are you... serious?

165
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:50,458
Yikes, that's harsh.

166
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:52,875
I can't believe it...

167
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:56,166
Now I have to be shy
around women for another year!

168
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:58,958
[BULMA] And I have to wait
another year for a boyfriend...

169
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:03,916
[PILAF] Is this on? I wouldn't
worry your pretty, little heads

170
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,833
over what's going to
happen a year from now!

171
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:11,083
You're all going to
be terminated tomorrow!

172
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:12,958
I hope you're enjoying
your accommodations because

173
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:16,666
I personally designed
the cell you're in! I call

174
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,833
it my Easy Bake Office!

175
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:22,166
[PILAF] I wanted to see how hot
I could make a room by absorbing

176
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:23,708
all of the sun's rays!

177
00:16:23,791 --> 00:16:26,625
It's pleasant in there now,
but just wait until the sun

178
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:32,291
comes up! Then,
get ready to broil!

179
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:37,041
I'm going to roast you alive
and enjoy every minute of it!

180
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:39,041
That fiend!

181
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:40,708
We've got to get out of here!

182
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,541
Oh, now my skin's
gonna dry up,

183
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:45,416
and I'm gonna get
premature wrinkles!

184
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:48,041
At least you'll die with a tan!

185
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:51,291
Oh, yeah, that's right.
I'll be dead!

186
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:54,541
I don't wanna die,
I'm too young!

187
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:56,000
I am, too!

188
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:58,416
[wailing]

189
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,083
I can't die now!

190
00:17:01,583 --> 00:17:02,958
Oh no, oh no, oh no!

191
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:04,458
I'm hungry.

192
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:06,291
[PILAF] They kind of remind
me of those little goldfish

193
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:09,166
I used to have.
And they'll die just as quickly.

194
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:12,291
[blows landing]

195
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:16,083
[GOKU] Ka-me-ha-me-ha!

196
00:17:18,708 --> 00:17:20,416
[GOKU] Ha!

197
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:23,333
--Come on you guys!
--You can do it!

198
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:29,666
That's right, struggle! Do you
two idiots really think you

199
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:34,500
can break through three solid
feet of my super-special steel?!

200
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:41,291
He's right, it's not gonna work.
We're stuck here.

201
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:45,125
Sleep well, and I'll wake
you up early for toast!

202
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:48,791
[laughing]

203
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:56,208
[SHU] Carefully, sire.

204
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:59,750
[PILAF] Ahh, there.
That's it, see?

205
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:02,666
Sometimes it's the small
accomplishments in life that

206
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,541
--have to suffice.
--[SHU] So true.

207
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,625
Of course, if it wasn't
for those kids, I'd be

208
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:08,916
ruling the world right now!

209
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:17,583
But come sunrise,
they'll all be french-fried!

210
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:25,375
Uh?

211
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:35,333
You think he'd at least
give us a last request...

212
00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:37,458
Well, I have a last request!

213
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:39,833
Oolong, will you
please shut up?!

214
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:42,166
Request denied, glamour girl!

215
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:43,583
[PUAR] Ohh...

216
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:53,041
[OOLONG] Hey, Puar,
what are you doing up there?

217
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:55,125
Nothing, just watching the moon.

218
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:56,458
How can you watch the moon?

219
00:18:56,541 --> 00:18:59,000
Aren't you
worried about tomorrow?!

220
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:01,000
Yeah, but that's why
I'm looking at the moon:

221
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:04,541
It's soothing. Look
how full it is tonight.

222
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:07,125
Doesn't it make you
feel all warm and fuzzy?

223
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:09,250
I'm a pig,
I am warm and fuzzy!

224
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:13,000
A full moon?

225
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:16,000
Did you guys know that
a terrible monster comes

226
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:18,333
out when the moon is full?

227
00:19:18,416 --> 00:19:20,416
Oh, come on Goku,
you're making that up!

228
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:23,250
There's no such thing. You
should put that imagination

229
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:26,875
to better use and figure out
a way to get us out of here!

230
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:28,583
But I'm not making it up,
Bulma!

231
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:32,041
My Grandpa was trampled
to death by that monster!

232
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:35,791
What? Gohan, the
supreme martial arts master?

233
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:38,916
That's gotta be one
big, savage monster.

234
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,333
Yeah.

235
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:42,791
It destroyed our house
and crushed all of our trees.

236
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:45,083
[OOLONG] What did
it look like, Goku?

237
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:47,875
I'm not really sure,
I slept through the whole thing.

238
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:50,083
[OOLONG] What? How could you
sleep if a huge monster was

239
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:52,875
fighting your grandpa
and wrecking your house?

240
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:54,708
[GOKU] I don't know.
The last thing I remember was

241
00:19:54,791 --> 00:19:57,500
Grandpa warning me about the
full moon and how I should

242
00:19:57,583 --> 00:20:01,958
never, ever look at it.
Of course, that didn't have

243
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:04,458
anything to do with the
monster. Grandpa was always

244
00:20:04,541 --> 00:20:06,833
saying these really strange
things, and every--

245
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,166
[GOKU] Hey, what
are you guys doing?

246
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,583
Oh, nothing.

247
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:11,916
Hey, Goku?

248
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,083
Can I ask you a
little something?

249
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:15,500
Sure.

250
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:17,375
[BULMA] The night your
grandfather was killed, did you

251
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:19,958
happen to look at the full moon?

252
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:25,666
[GOKU] Well. I think I did.
Just before I fell asleep. Why?

253
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:27,625
I'm getting a
little nervous...

254
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:29,666
You're not the only one...

255
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:32,000
I had a feeling that
Goku wasn't just an ordinary

256
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:35,416
kid, I think I was right.

257
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,458
I'm at a loss here,
Yamcha.

258
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:39,625
How do we find out for sure?

259
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:42,166
How do you find
out what for sure?

260
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:44,083
I guess we could make
him look at the moon,

261
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:45,750
then there wouldn't
be any doubts at all!

262
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:46,958
That's true...

263
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:49,041
But what if he...

264
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:52,041
What if he does
turn into a monster?

265
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:54,666
We'd end up just
like his grandpa!

266
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:57,791
Yeah, that'd be a lot of fun.

267
00:20:57,875 --> 00:21:01,416
Let's not chance it.
It's far too dangerous.

268
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,166
I'm with you!

269
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:05,875
Goku, be very careful
not to look at the moon!

270
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:07,333
[BULMA] It's right above you!

271
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:08,791
[GOKU] Huh?

272
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:12,791
Huh.

273
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:16,875
[GOKU] I don't see what
the big deal is?

274
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:20,375
Are you okay, Goku?

275
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:21,833
Of course I am!

276
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:24,458
You had us
scared there, kid!

277
00:21:24,541 --> 00:21:25,500
Phew!

278
00:21:25,583 --> 00:21:27,166
I knew it was
just a coincidence.

279
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,500
I'd suggest we run,
but I wouldn't know where!

280
00:21:40,583 --> 00:21:43,375
Goku, stop it,
this isn't funny!

281
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,416
[YAMCHA] I don't
think he's joking!

like an earthquake.

290

return to his normal self?

00:22:42,625 --> 00:22:45,458
Or will he unknowingly be
responsible for the destruction

of Bulma, Yamcha, and
