[NARRATOR]
Previously on Dragon Ball,

3
00:02:15,166 --> 00:02:17,375
the crowds gathered from
far and wide to witness

4
00:02:17,458 --> 00:02:19,958
the spectacle of the World
Martial Arts Tournament.

5
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:21,750
And what a spectacle it was!

6
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:23,750
Krillin kick-started the action

7
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:27,541
by knocking the wind out
of the foul Bacterian.

8
00:02:28,416 --> 00:02:31,125
Next, Yamcha displayed
his finest fighting moves,

9
00:02:31,208 --> 00:02:34,583
but fell at the
hands of Jackie Chun.

10
00:02:34,666 --> 00:02:36,291
Nam used his
disciplined fighting style

11
00:02:36,375 --> 00:02:41,416
to combat the feminine
wiles of Ranfan.

12
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,166
And Goku stunned the crowd

13
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:46,500
by toppling the
Monster Beast Giran!

14
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,708
[NARRATOR] Krillin attacked
Jackie Chun in the semifinals,

15
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:53,125
but was unable to penetrate
the old man's defenses.

16
00:02:53,208 --> 00:02:55,583
And Goku's raw
strength proved to be

17
00:02:55,666 --> 00:03:00,500
more than Nam could handle,
despite his finest efforts,

18
00:03:00,583 --> 00:03:03,250
[NARRATOR] Now,
only two competitors remain,

19
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:06,666
and the final match to
determine the new World Champion

20
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:10,083
will pit Goku's youthful
enthusiasm against the age

21
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:12,333
and experience of Jackie Chun.

22
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:16,125
But, little does Goku realize,
the man he's about to fight

23
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:18,833
is in fact none other
than Master Roshi,

24
00:03:18,916 --> 00:03:20,708
who has cleverly
concealed his identity

25
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:24,375
to put his pupil
to the ultimate test.

26
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:37,458
[OOLONG] Oh! Pardon me!

27
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:39,666
'Scuse me! Comin' through!

28
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:44,000
Hey Oolong,
any luck finding Master Roshi?

29
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:47,666
Uh uh... I... couldn't
get anywhere in this crowd.

30
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:50,500
I just can't believe
he'd miss this fight...

31
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:52,625
He's got to be here somewhere...

32
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:54,625
Now...!

33
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:56,583
Let's have a quick word
with our two finalists

34
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:58,750
before this match
gets underway...

35
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:00,291
What do you say?

36
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:04,500
[ANNOUNCER]
Goku, could you tell us a little

37
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:06,958
about your strategy
going into this bout?

38
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:10,083
Huh? My... strada-what?

39
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:11,458
Your... strategy.

40
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:13,791
That is... your plans
for winning the fight?

41
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,583
Oh, I don't know.

42
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:19,541
I guess... my stra-je-dy
is to do my best!

43
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:23,958
Well then...

44
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:25,166
There you have it...!

45
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:27,916
A boy of few words indeed...!

46
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,833
But I guess you don't
have to say much

47
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:34,125
when you've made it all
the way to the finals!

48
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:47,000
[CROWD cheering]

49
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:48,208
Now it's time,

50
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:50,875
to talk to our next
competitor, Jackie Chun,

51
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:53,083
and I'm certain
this fighting veteran

52
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:56,208
is going to have plenty to say!

53
00:04:57,083 --> 00:05:00,666
[ANNOUNCER] Jackie, what
are your plans for this match?

54
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,250
Jackie...?

55
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:04,000
Mister Chun...?

56
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:17,708
[snoring]

57
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:22,041
Uh... Well he, he seems
to be sleeping right now.

58
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:25,375
Ha, ha, ha, ha...
Just like a true master...

59
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:28,250
Extremely relaxed
before the big fight.

60
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:29,958
Ha ha ha ha.

61
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:31,333
[YAMCHA] You know, Krillin?

62
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:33,375
Now that I'm sure that
old guy isn't Master Roshi,

63
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:36,750
I think Goku actually has
a chance of winning this thing.

64
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:37,958
[KRILLIN] Maybe...

65
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:39,916
But, that "old guy"
beat the two of us

66
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,708
like a couple of chumps...!

67
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:43,625
I'm not so sure...

68
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:49,791
Here we go...

69
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:58,041
That's my cue...

70
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:18,875
Let the match... begin!!

71
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:26,666
Oh! Jackie Chun has...
taken the offensive!

72
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:29,583
He's looking for
another quick victory!

73
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,583
Oh no! Just like that!
He's out?!

74
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:58,583
And he can't use the
Flying Nimbus this time!

75
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:00,000
Foolish boy...!

76
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:02,083
If I've told him once,
I've told him a thousand times!

77
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:03,791
Never let your guard down!

"Danger is the nosey next
door neighbor of Security!"

79
00:07:07,416 --> 00:07:08,875
If he'd just remembered that,

80
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:11,458
he might not've
lost so quickly...

81
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:17,500
Well, this is bad...

82
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:18,958
What do I do now?

Hey, what'd you expect?

this seasoned martial artist...
continues to amaze!

88
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,166
In what may be record time,
he's managed to defeat

89

yet another opponent
with a minimum of effort!

It's what I do.

Ohhh, he lost the match...

00:07:45,416 --> 00:07:48,000
Guess that old man
really knows his stuff.

Ho-ho-ho!

Is there no end to this
youngster's resourcefulness?

to fly like a helicopter,

back into the ring!

Nyaaaaah!

00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:18,208
You're pretty arrogant
for someone who almost lost...!

119
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:20,291
That tail's all that saved you!

120
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:21,125
Not really.

121
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:22,250
I could have flown back

122
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:24,333
with a Kamehameha
Wave like you did...

123
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:26,958
But I thought it'd be good
to save that for later.

[JACKIE CHUN] Hmph!
Quit kidding yourself son!

125
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:31,041
That technique
is far to difficult

00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:34,375
for a child to perform!
You can't do it.

127

Yes I can!

Hoo! Arrogant, I tell you...

Well, we'll see about that!

130
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:43,250
Are you so sure of
your Kamehameha Waves

131
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:47,291
that you'd try one against me,
the man who invented them?

132
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:49,666
You invented?
But I always thought

133
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:52,791
the Kamehameha Wave
was Master Roshi's trick...

134
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:56,041
Uhhh...
Well, of course it is...

135
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:59,541
I mean, how silly!
Of course he did it first!

136
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:04,708
Then, if he did it first,
why'd you say you invented them?

Uh...

Has anyone ever told you that
you ask way too many questions?!

Uh... Uh....

It's perfectly
obvious, isn't it?

145
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:27,541
First... I balance!

146
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:34,916
Then... I stretch!

147
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,583
Next I focus my entire body...

148
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:41,458
With some mild aerobics!

149
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,333

00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:24,333
You're the best, Goku!

164
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:25,791
Keep it up, kid!

165
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:26,541
You got'im!

166
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:29,750
[GOKU chuckles]

167
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:31,625
Remember this day, folks!

168
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:33,625
This may be the
only time in your life

169
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:36,708
you'll see two masters
of the legendary

170
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:40,083
Kamehameha Wave
in the same arena!

171
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:41,583
The first is Jackie Chun,

172
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:45,291
and the second is this
amazing, amazing boy, Goku!

173
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:47,500
[JACKIE CHUN thinking]
Yes... Goku is amazing!

174
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:50,291
I really didn't expect
him to do this well...

175
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:51,458
No matter.

176
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:55,166
It'll all be over
with my next attack...

177
00:13:06,666 --> 00:13:09,291
[ANNOUNCER] Now,
let the match continue!

178
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:12,750
So far these two incredible
finalists have fought to a draw,

179
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,166
but keep your eyes open,

180
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:16,708
because at some point
that's gotta change!

181
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:20,958
Only one of them can be named
the Champion of the World!

182
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:32,500
This is fun!
What should we try next?

183
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:35,000
Fun is it...?

184
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:39,333
Well, it's too bad
playtime's over...! Ha!

185
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:42,500
This again?

186
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:43,791
Don't you know
any better tricks?

187
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:46,333
You've done this one already!

188
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:48,625
Now, which one
is the real one?

189
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:50,916
[GOKU] Here!!

190
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:54,291
[JACKIE CHUN] I'm sorry...

191
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:55,833
Were you looking for me?

192
00:13:55,916 --> 00:13:57,000
Huh?!

193
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:05,583
Oh, Goku!!

194
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,958
The Double After-Image!
Heh heh... Never fails...

195
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:15,333
Hey...! Don't you
have a job to do?

196
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:17,083
Oh, right! Sorry!

197
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:18,500
One!

198
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:20,250
Two!

199
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:21,875
Three!

200
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:23,500
Four!

201
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:24,708
Five!

202
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:25,833
Sorry to put your lights
out like that, Goku,

203
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:28,416
but it had...
to end sometime...

204
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,250
[ANNOUNCER] Eight...!.

205
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:32,000
Ni--Oh!!

206
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:38,416
Why, of all the...

207
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,375
How does he do it?!

208
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:42,958
All right..
Now it's my turn!

209
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:48,291
You little copy cat!

210
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:51,750
Think you can use
my own trick on me--do you...?

211
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:53,750
Well it's not going to work!

212
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:57,291
Hmph!

213
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:59,041
Just as I thought--a
double after-image!

214
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:03,208
[JACKIE CHUN] Not to worry...

215
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:06,958
Heh heh... I know right
where to find you...

216
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:14,750
[GOKU] Here I am!

217
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:26,708
The Triple After-image!

218
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:31,833
I made that up myself...!

219
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:33,208
You like it?

220
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:35,708
New rule.

221
00:15:35,791 --> 00:15:37,750
No hitting your
teacher in the head.

222
00:15:37,833 --> 00:15:38,458
What?

223
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:39,416
What do you mean?

224
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,958
You're not my teacher...

225
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:43,958
My teacher's Master Roshi!

226
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:46,125
Of course he is...!

227
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:48,625
I knew that!
Just got a little confused...

228
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:50,375
[GOKU thinking] That's twice
he's confused himself

229
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:52,166
with Master Roshi...

230
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:54,125
What...? What is it?

231
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:56,208
Why are you looking
at me like that?

232
00:15:56,291 --> 00:15:58,000
[GOKU] I got it!

233
00:15:58,708 --> 00:15:59,958
I figured it out...!

234
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:01,958
You're Master Roshi's brother!

235
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:04,708
Huh...? Phew... Ha!

236
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:07,250
You caught me!
We're family all right!

237
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:08,416
Oooh...

238
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,958
That explains
why you look like him!

239
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:13,000
[JACKIE CHUN]
Uh, Yeah, he he...

240
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:14,750
eh, but I'm not
actually his brother...

241
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:17,666
Here, look... You see...?
I'm his cousin!

242
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:21,500
[GOKU] Huh?

243
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:23,041
[JACKIE CHUN] Hm?

244
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:23,875
Wha...?

245
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:26,000
Bu, eh... I... well... uh...

246
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:29,041
Well I am, you know. Really.

247
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:35,458
Hahahaha.

248
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:37,708
But--this is no time
to be laughing...

249
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:39,666
We have a match to finish.

250
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:53,833
What are you doing?

251
00:16:57,916 --> 00:17:00,500
Uh... What's the matter...?

252
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:02,250
You okay?

253
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:03,750
[ANNOUNCER] Oh!

254
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:06,791
And Jackie Chun is staggering
wildly about the ring...!

255
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:10,041
Either he's a little punch-drunk
from that last blow to the head,

256
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:13,000
or he's been taking a few too
many pulls off the ol' flask,

257
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:14,458
if you know what I mean...

258
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:17,875
Are you all right?

259
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:23,916
Ow! What'd you
do that for?

260
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:32,375
Hey, are you crazy?

261
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,791
Is that...

262
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:46,666
Don't be fooled Goku...!

263
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:49,083
He's using the
Drunken Boxing Technique!

264
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:51,708
He's only pretending
to be tipsy!

265
00:17:51,791 --> 00:17:53,041
Tipsy?

266
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:53,916
He, he, he!

267
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
You know, 'Tipsy'!

268
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:57,250
Tanked! Looped! Schnockered!

269
00:17:57,333 --> 00:17:59,000
I know... Drunken Boxing!

270
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:00,500
I recognize it now...!

271
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:03,416
That was one of...
my grandpa's specialties...

272
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,416
I wonder how <i>he</i> knows it?

273
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:11,041
[ANNOUNCER] Look at this!

274
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:12,916
It seems there may
be some method

275
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,625
to Jackie's madness after all!

276
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:18,041
Ha ha! Everybody dance!

277
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:26,166
[ANNOUNCER] Then again--

278
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:28,333
he could just be
out of his gourd...

279
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:51,125
[ANNOUNCER] Uh oh!

280
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:53,500
Looks like Goku's having
trouble staying on his feet!

281
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:58,125
Having some trouble, Goku...?

282
00:18:58,208 --> 00:18:59,708
Yes, it's hard to Drunken Box...

283
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:02,125
if you've never
been drunk before!

284
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:04,416
Oh. Oh no.

285
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,458
Come on, kid...
Hang in there...

286
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:08,958
Uh oh!

287
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:12,000
Last call...!
Everybody go home...!

288
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:13,625
Time to go...!

289
00:19:14,916 --> 00:19:16,166
[JACKIE CHUN] Wait...

290
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:19,958
You know I didn't mean that...
literally, right?

291
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:38,583
Hey... are... are you... crying?

292
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:48,916
[monkey noises]

293
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,958
What are you doing?!

294
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:54,875
 Come on! Stop goofing around!

295
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:49,541
[JACKIE CHUN] I thought we...
agreed no hitting in the head!

296
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:51,458
What're you trying
to do to me...?

297
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:55,916
Crazy Monkey Technique!

298
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:26,708
Oooh! There you go, kid!

299
00:21:26,791 --> 00:21:29,875
Give it to 'im good, Goku!

300
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:31,416
Goku's gonna win!

301
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,791
I never had a doubt!

302
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:35,041
[ANNOUNCER] Once again,

303
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:37,125
the tide of this Championship
bout has turned!

304
00:21:37,208 --> 00:21:41,333
Goku's wild "monkey" attacks
have given him the advantage...!

305
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:43,416
It looks like Jackie Chun
has an uphill battle

306
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:46,750
to fight if he hopes
to regain control!

307
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:50,500
Oh, I'm not out of this yet...

308
00:21:51,916 --> 00:21:57,458
In fact, I've already won...

309
00:21:57,541 --> 00:21:59,416
You have?

310
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,708
[ANNOUNCER] What's this?

311
00:22:00,791 --> 00:22:03,041
Jackie Chun has just
named himself the winner!

312
00:22:04,458 --> 00:22:05,958
[ANNOUNCER]
But let's watch and see

313
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:08,208
if he has the moves
to back up his claim!

314
00:22:08,291 --> 00:22:10,291
Don't be surprised
if this fighting master

315
00:22:10,375 --> 00:22:13,208
still has a few fearsome
tricks up his sleeve!

316
00:22:23,333 --> 00:22:24,583
[GOKU] Huh?

317
00:22:24,666 --> 00:22:26,375
[ANNOUNCER] Uh oh!
This doesn't look good for Goku!

318
00:22:26,458 --> 00:22:29,500
Jackie's gathering the
energy for his next attack,

319
00:22:29,583 --> 00:22:32,083
which may be the
only one he'll need

320
00:22:32,166 --> 00:22:37,250
to win this match and
become World Champion!

321
00:22:40,666 --> 00:22:42,750
[NARRATOR] Jackie Chun,
the disguised Master Roshi,

322
00:22:42,833 --> 00:22:45,291
has reached into his
bag of fighting techniques

323
00:22:45,375 --> 00:22:47,625
and pulled out a
powerful finishing move!

324
00:22:47,708 --> 00:22:50,458
Can Goku withstand
the coming attack?
