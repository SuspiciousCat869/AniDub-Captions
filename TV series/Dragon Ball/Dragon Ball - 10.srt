1
00:02:23,416 --> 00:02:26,083
[NARRATOR] Our heroes, Goku and
Bulma, along with Oolong the 

2
00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:29,083
shape-changing pig, are
unaware that they're still being

3
00:02:29,166 --> 00:02:32,791
tailed by Yamcha and Puar as
they follow their radar to

4
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:35,458
the seventh, and
final, Dragon Ball!

5
00:02:37,208 --> 00:02:39,125
[BULMA] It won't be
long now, you guys!

6
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:42,541
[BULMA] Wow!

7
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:45,291
I can't believe I'm so close
to having my wish fulfilled!

8
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:47,708
I wonder what he's
going to look like?

9
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:49,583
[OOLONG] Hey, I've
been meaning to ask.

10
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:51,583
So this big wish--
there's gonna be enough

11
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:53,166
for all of us, right?

12
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,166
I was thinking along the lines
of all the gold in the world!

13
00:02:56,583 --> 00:02:59,000
[BULMA] Oh, I forgot
to tell you didn't I?

14
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:01,500
A boyfriend! That's
what I'll wish for!

15
00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:04,291
[OOLONG] What?! A boyfriend?!

16
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:05,875
[BULMA] What's wrong?

17
00:03:05,958 --> 00:03:08,625
[OOLONG] So you're gonna waste
our wish so you can get yourself

18
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:10,333
a boyfriend? What a rip off!

19
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:12,416
[BULMA] What?!
You take that back!

20
00:03:13,416 --> 00:03:15,166
I think that
you're just jealous!

21
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,166
[OOLONG] I knew I
should have stayed at home!

22
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:19,875
[BULMA] Whoa! Slow down!

23
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:21,125
[GOKU] Look out!

24
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:22,125
[OOLONG] Huh?

25
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:26,958
--[BULMA screaming]

[cawing]

28
00:03:52,625 --> 00:03:55,458
[PUAR] Hey Yamcha , I'm
beginning to think they're lost.

29
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:58,500
I can't believe the last
Dragon Ball is way out here!

30
00:03:58,583 --> 00:04:00,666
[YAMCHA] Be patient.
Puar, It's out there,

31
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:03,291
I know it is! I can
feel it--we're close!

32
00:04:03,375 --> 00:04:04,375
Real close!

33
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:07,625
Soon I will wish
away my fear of women!

34
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:12,416
--[gasping]
--[running footsteps]

35
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,708
[SHU] I'm gonna be toast if
I don't get to that meeting

36
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:16,250
with Emperor PIlaf!

37
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:18,583
[PILAF] Mai, if you don't fix
that Dragon Ball detector by

38
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:21,583
the time I count to ten, then
you will be joining my hungry

39
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:23,291
friends here for lunch!

40
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:25,375
[roaring]

41
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:27,625
One...

42
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:31,333
Two...

43
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:32,291
Three...

44
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:33,250
Four...

45
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:34,125
Five...

46
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,166
[MAI] Uh, Emperor Pilaf!
Speaking of lunch, you...

47
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:38,416
you must be hungry right?

48
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:41,708
[PILAF] Well, yes. I am hungry!

49
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:45,333
Starving, really. You
know, a hamburger

50
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:47,041
would be nice right now.

51
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:49,916
Hold it! What
number was I on, Mai?

52
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,375
[MAI] Huh?

53
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,541
[PILAF] Nevermind.
I'll start over.

54
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:55,416
One, two, three

55
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,666
Four. Five. Six.

56
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:57,750
[screams]

57
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:59,375
[MAI] Emperor Pilaf!

58
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:00,958
[PILAF] What now?

59
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:02,583
[MAI] Oh nothing, it's just...
well, sometimes, when you take

60
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:06,083
command like this, it's
invigorating to be around you.

61
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,875
[PILAF] Oh! I see!

62
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:11,041
[roaring]

63
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Oh, right. Now
where was I?

64
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:14,875
[MAI] Huh?

65
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,291
[PILAF] Okay, maybe
I should start at...

66
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:18,875
Six!

67
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:20,625
[roaring]

68
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:24,333
[SHU] I made it sire! I made it!

69
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:26,750
[PILAF] Excellent, Shu,
you're right on time.

70
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:30,250
Now, have you
located the balls? Report!

71
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:32,375
[SHU] Well, I ordered pizza.

72
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:33,750
[MAI] Sire, I fixed it!

73
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:38,125
[MAI] The Dragon Ball detector
is working and we're already

74
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:40,083
receiving a signal
on one of the balls.

75
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:42,625
Attempting to isolate signal
and increase magnification

76
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:43,666
to level five.

77
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,583
[MAI] Level six, seven, eight.

78
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:48,125
Signal isolated at
magnification level nine, sir!

79
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:52,708
Oh my! This can't be!

80
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:55,458
There's a ball just ten
steps south of this location!

81
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:56,916
And a couple
of steps east.

82
00:05:57,958 --> 00:05:59,791
No, wait... it's south.

83
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:01,875
By about... oh...
I'd say seven paces.

84
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:05,041
Then, six steps straight
ahead and you're there!

85
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:07,916
[SHU] I found it!

86
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,125
[PILAF] Argh!

87
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:13,375
Oh, what do we have here?

88
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:17,916
Look, it's a Dragon Ball!
The one we already have!

89
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,083
That monkey-boy and his friends
have the Dragon Balls we want,

90
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:21,916
so where is he?!

91
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,375
We have a spy
bird tracking him.

92
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:26,875
[MAI] Mecha number seven.

93
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:29,833
There it is now, Emperor.

94
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:33,416
[MAI] Once we download the
visuals from Mecha 7, we'll know

95
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,291
exactly where they are going.

96
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:03,041
Ringleader, they just passed
out of the northern quadrant

97
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:04,541
and they're heading southwest!

98
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:05,791
Over!

99
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:08,291
[PILAF] Excellent! Tell
big brother to engage!

100
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:09,458
Roger!

101
00:07:09,541 --> 00:07:10,958
[MAI] Come in, big
brother, do you copy?

102
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:12,125
Over!

103
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:14,375
[SHU] 10-4, baby sister!
I got my ears on!

104
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:16,375
The subject
is approaching.

[SHU] Okie-dokie! Over!

106
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:22,666
Bulma, I'm going to
ask you nicely this time.

107
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:25,291
Would you please,
please change your wish!

108
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:27,583
There must be something
you want that the three of us

109
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:29,166
can split between us?

110
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:31,541
Remember, Oolong, just
one word from me and you'll have

111
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:34,166
to go to the bathroom
thanks to that pill!

[OOLONG] This is
a protest, Bulma!

I'm not moving another inch
until you change your wish

117

to something reasonable!

Sure! I wish you'd just
shut your face and drive!

Let's just shut
up and go for it!

[BULMA] My boyfriend!
It's not fair!

They've probably summoned
the Dragon already...

But, I've still got one.

could outsmart us!

No way, mister!

You did it!
You're the best! Yay!

[PUAR] What should
we do, Yamcha?

212
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:52,583
I think they need a lift.

Now what?

00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:58,916
No choice.
We've gotta give them a ride.

But Yamcha, what about
your fear of girls?!

00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:05,375
I don't have a choice.
If we don't help them now,

Hi, Yamcha!

227
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:30,416
What a coincidence!
Are you guys stuck out here?

228
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:35,833
Yeah! We were
until you showed up.

229
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:39,250
Could you give us a ride,
Yamcha? Pretty please!

Sure... we'd be...
we'd be happy to...

Yamcha, I know this might
sound a little weird, but

00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:49,125
there's something I'd
like you to do for me.

Would you mind closing
your eyes for a second?

Yeah, just for a second.
Pretty please?

Aw, come on.

she really gonna kiss me?

talking and more walking!

00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:29,958
[wind howling]

322
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:32,333
[GOKU] It looks clear
down this way, guys.

323
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,583
[OOLONG] Goku,
don't walk so fast!

324
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:36,625
[BULMA] Shh!

325
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:49,208
Perfect!

326
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:55,875

328
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:09,208
Help me!

329
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:13,750
[screaming]

330
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:16,875
[crash]

331
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:18,291
Got ya!

00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:23,458

[crashing]

336
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:44,875
[YAMCHA] A... little help?

337
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:47,041
[GOKU] You guys okay?

338
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:52,458
Alright! That does it!

339
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:53,208
Let's go get 'em!

340
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:56,791
Oh, thank you!
You saved me!

341
00:20:57,333 --> 00:21:03,166
[YAMCHA screaming]

342
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:05,208
Take a breath!

343
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:08,708
Golly!

344
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:12,000
[PILAF] That trap didn't work!

345
00:21:13,166 --> 00:21:15,083
Who designed
that trap anyway?

346
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:17,125
Uh, it wasn't me, sire.

347
00:21:17,208 --> 00:21:19,916
[PILAF] I want the name of
the ninny who designed it!

348
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
It was you.

349
00:21:23,958 --> 00:21:25,666
[BULMA] What's that sound?

350
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:27,416
[OOLONG] It's just
my teeth chattering!

351
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:30,583
[YAMCHA] Be careful! There
could be traps everywhere!

352
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:31,916
[BULMA] Okay...

353
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,833
[OOLONG] Puar, quit
pushing, would ya!

354
00:21:33,916 --> 00:21:35,625
[PUAR] Then get moving, Oolong!

355
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:38,791
[GOKU] Hey, what's that?

356
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:42,375
It's a trap, isn't it?

357
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:43,500
I don't know.

358
00:21:43,583 --> 00:21:44,875
It's too obvious.

359
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:47,250
[GOKU] Hey there's
another arrow over here!

360
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:50,000
[YAMCHA] Let's check it out!

361
00:21:55,708 --> 00:21:59,458
[OOLONG] Excuse me, but
where are we going, huh?

362
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:15,416
[GOKU] It's a dead end!

363
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,541
[OOLONG] Oh, did you
have to say that, Goku?

364
00:22:21,166 --> 00:22:22,583
[YAMCHA] Oh no!

365
00:22:22,666 --> 00:22:24,541
[BULMA] We're trapped!

366
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:28,375
So, Emperor, what do
you want to do now?

367
00:22:28,458 --> 00:22:31,458
I think maybe I'll
have some fun with them!

368
00:22:31,541 --> 00:22:35,333
Ah, yes. But first,
I'll take their Dragon Ball!

369
00:22:35,416 --> 00:22:41,625
[PILAF laughing]

370
00:22:41,708 --> 00:22:44,458
[NARRATOR] If Emperor Pilaf has
his way, what hope is there for
