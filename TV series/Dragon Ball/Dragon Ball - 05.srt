[engine humming]

3
00:02:29,791 --> 00:02:32,875
[NARRATOR] With only two
more Dragon Balls left to find,

4
00:02:32,958 --> 00:02:36,583
our heroes, Goku and Bulma
are heading into very dangerous

5
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:40,041
territory as they
continue their search.

6
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:43,041
Joining them in their quest
is Oolong, the perverse pig

7
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:45,833
who can change his
appearance at will.

8
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:50,666
[engine humming]

9
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,666
[BULMA] It was a good idea
to travel down this river.

10
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,958
We're making awesome time!

11
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:56,000
That's great!

12
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:57,958
But why is Oolong
coming with us?

13
00:02:58,041 --> 00:03:00,208
I think she's got
a thing for me, kid!

14
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:02,333
I thought Oolong's
special powers might come

15
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:04,833
in handy. That's why
he's coming along.

16
00:03:04,916 --> 00:03:06,250
Hey, what do you mean?!

17
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:08,166
Are you tryin' to
say I'm not your type?

18
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:11,958
Exactly! I'm looking for
tall, dark, and handsome!

19
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:14,583
Just give it
time, honey!

20
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:16,458
You'll see, "I'm the man"!

21
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:19,833
[OOLONG squealing]

22
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:22,291
Hey, back off kid!
I ain't that kinda pig!

23
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:23,916
You were right!
You are a man!

24
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,166
Of course I'm
a man, you imbecile!

25
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,500
What more do you want?
I'll take a polygraph,

26
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:32,208
give a blood sample, just
don't ever do that again!

27

[engine humming]

29
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:50,875
Hey Bulma,
how much further?

30
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:53,083
Well, we should
almost be there by now.

31
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:55,500
This map will tell us exactly.

32
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:58,541
We've been driving
forever already!

33
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:00,791
Where in the world
are we going??

34
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:03,833
We're going to a place
called "Fire Mountain".

35
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:05,333
Fire Mountain?!

36
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:08,041
Are you crazy?! There's no
way you're draggin' me anywhere

37
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:09,166
near that place!

38
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,250
[squealing]

39
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:11,833
[GOKU] What's so
scary about a mountain?

40
00:04:11,916 --> 00:04:14,375
For starters, the place
is always on fire, and it's the

41
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:17,583
home of the terrible Ox-King!
Do you understand now?

42
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:19,083
That bad, huh?

43
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:20,125
[OOLONG] Mm-hmm.

44
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:21,500
[BULMA] Relax, Oolong.

45
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:23,041
Goku's strong enough to
take care of some old "ox".

46
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:25,208
[OOLONG] I don't
know about that.

47
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:27,916
I've heard the Ox-King is the
strongest guy in the whole

48
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,958
world! They say he's over
ten feet tall and weighs

49
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:35,291
500 pounds. And he's always on
the prowl for anyone who might

50
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:39,250
try to climb up the mountain to
get to his castle. He carries a

51
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:42,333
giant battle axe, and let me
tell you, he knows how to use

52
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:45,583
it too! He's been terrorizing
the countryside for years,

53
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:49,041
and they say that if you meet
the Ox-King, there's only one

54
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:53,916
thing you can do: Run! 'Cause
if he catches you, you'll get

55
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,708
a really "close shave"!

56
00:04:56,541 --> 00:04:58,000
You really heard that?

57
00:04:58,083 --> 00:04:59,833
[OOLONG] Uh-huh!

58
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:02,041
[GOKU] Sounds like
the guy's not very happy.

59
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:04,625
[OOLONG] Exactly!
He's radically unhappy!

60
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:09,416
Well, I'm outta here!

61
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:11,208
[BULMA] Hey!

62
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:14,708
[GOKU] Don't worry
Bulma. I'll get him!

63
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,291
Careful!

64
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:26,583
Ah, Sassa-fras'n school of fish!

65
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:27,791
Never did like school!

66
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:31,875
This kid's crazy!

67
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:37,208
I don't see him anywhere.
Where'd he go?

68
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:46,625
I lost him, Bulma!

69
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:49,791
Well, if you want to
catch a fish, you gotta use

70
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:51,583
the right kind of bait.

71
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:54,291
[BULMA] Like this!

72
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:56,333
Do you think he'll bite?

73
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:58,041
If I know
Oolong, he will!

74
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:05,041
[BULMA] I think
I've got a nibble.

75
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:09,208
Yeah! Grab him, Goku!

76
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:13,041
Hey, whaddaya know,
he bit your shorts!

77
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,416
Hey, why is all
the food gone?

78
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,041
Did you make a pig of yourself?

79
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:24,958
Unfortunate choice of words,
but the great outdoors

80
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:26,541
do make me hungry.

81
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:29,375
[BULMA] Here, take this special
vitamin. It'll fill you up,

82
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:30,708
and give you strength!

83
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:32,875
It doesn't look like much,
but I'll try it.

84
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:36,125
[BULMA] It's made from
all natural ingredients.

85
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:37,833
It's very good for you.

86
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:40,041
I just hope you
health nuts don't eat pork.

87
00:06:40,916 --> 00:06:42,541
[BULMA giggling]

88
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:44,666
[GOKU] Hey, Bulma!
What about me?

89
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:45,916
I'm hungry too!

90
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,500
Uh, that was
the last one.

91
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:49,416
See, kid?
It's my hoggish allure.

92
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,875
I'm not your
average porker!

93
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:52,625
[engine sputtering]

94
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:54,083
[ALL] Huh?!

95
00:06:57,958 --> 00:07:00,083
That's great!
We're outta gas!

96
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:03,250
Is that sorta like
being out of food?

97
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:06,000
Very good, that's exactly
what it's like Goku.

98
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:08,291
Then let's just
feed the boat.

99
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:10,958
Hey, Oolong, can you
change into a tank of gas?

100
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:13,125
Against union rules, honey!

101
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:15,166
Besides, I'd get all used up.

102
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:18,291
[BULMA] Then how about a paddle
just to help us get to shore?

103
00:07:18,375 --> 00:07:20,500
[OOLONG] I'd be honored
to be "handled" by a

104
00:07:20,583 --> 00:07:21,833
girl like you, Bulma.

105
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:23,666
Showtime!

106
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:29,875
Just go like this in the water,
and we'll move.

107
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,791
Wow, that's really neat!

108
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:34,916
[GOKU] Ha ha ha, yeah!

109
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,333
[OOLONG sputtering]

110
00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:42,458
[OOLONG] Hey! Watch
the water in the mouth,

111
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:44,375
you muscle-bound midget!

112
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:46,166
[GOKU laughing]

113
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:48,708
I gotta go, Bulma!

114
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:50,583
[BULMA] Don't be gone long!

115
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:55,291
[BULMA] Goku!
Really, that kid...

116
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:56,625
Well, it's too
bad we couldn't make

117
00:07:56,708 --> 00:07:58,125
it to Fire Mountain!

118
00:07:58,208 --> 00:07:59,750
I hate to disappoint you,
Oolong,

119
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:02,041
but we're
practically there already.

120
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:03,750
But it's
crazy to go there!

121
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:05,583
It's way too dangerous!

122
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:12,000
My... my Dyno Caps!
They're missing!

123
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:14,833
No! Aah! We're trapped in
a wasteland with no way

124
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:16,541
to get out!

125
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:19,958
I think you took our Dyno Caps,
just like you stole our lunch,

126
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,416
you little porker!

127
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,625
Hey! I resent
being called little!

128
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:26,208
[BULMA screaming]

129
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:29,083
What's the matter?
Why are you so upset?

130
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,375
You don't understand!
Without the Dyno-Caps

131
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:36,750
we're stuck here! No boats!
No bikes! Nothing! Nada!

132
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:37,666
But...

133
00:08:40,541 --> 00:08:42,666
Why can't you just walk, Bulma?

134
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:43,583
That's easy for you to say!

135
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:45,708
You can ride the Flying Nimbus!

136
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:49,458
[OOLONG chuckling]
So long, suckers!

137
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:51,500
Well, why don't you just
have Oolong change into a

138
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:54,208
motorbike, and then
ride him outta here?

139
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:56,041
[BULMA] Oh! That's a
great idea, Goku.

140
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:57,541
I'm glad I thought of it!

141
00:08:57,625 --> 00:09:00,000
Hey! Oolong, dear?

142
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:01,375
Huh?

143
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03,250
Ahh! He ditched us!

144
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:05,958
[GOKU] Don't worry,
Bulma. I'll go get him!

145
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:10,083
[GOKU] Hey, Oolong
where are you?

146
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:13,083
Come out, come out
wherever you are!

147
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:15,833
You can't hide forever!

148
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:18,000
Hey, oh, Oolong!

149
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:21,291
If you come out I'll give
you a nice juicy pail of slop!

150
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,958
[OOLONG] If he thinks I'm
dumb enough to fall for the

151
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:28,583
old 'juicy pail of
slop' routine, then he's

152
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:29,625
even dumber than I thought!

153
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:35,166
There's no sign of
him anywhere, Bulma.

154
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:38,708
Oh! I knew I
couldn't trust him!

155
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:41,875
Piggy Piggy Piggy Piggy!

156
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:44,250
Piggy Piggy Piggy!

157
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:45,541
[BULMA] Piggy Piggy!

158
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:48,625
[intense rumbling]

159
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:50,458
[OOLONG] What's wrong
with my poor stomach?!

160
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:57,041
Woah! Oh, oh, I'm gonna blow!

161
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:02,750
[intense diarrhea]

162
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:07,250
Hey! Hey, Oolong!
What's the matter, little piggy?

163
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:09,000
You know that
vitamin I gave you?

164
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:11,541
It's really a pill that makes
you have to go "squatty potty"

165
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:13,916
anytime someone makes
the "Piggy" sound!

166
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
[BULMA] You're
not going anywhere!

167
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:19,666
Oh, that's perfect!

168
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,916
Huh, guess I've
got you under my power

169
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,625
now, little piggy!

170
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:30,833
[BULMA] What's with you?

171
00:10:30,916 --> 00:10:31,875
You're a witch!

172
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:34,208
You cast a spell
on Oolong, admit it!

173
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:36,666
Oh Goku,
don't be so naive!

174
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:39,250
If I were a witch I wouldn't
need the Dragon Balls to

175
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:42,208
grant my wishes. That pill
was just a little bit of science

176
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:43,916
to control cowards like--

177
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,291
[OOLONG] Cheap shot!

178
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:49,583
Lucky for me I brought
some toilet paper along.

179
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:52,500
So, I trust my little
pill will keep you in line?

180
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:53,708
Yeah...

181
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:58,083
Yeah, I'll be "in line"
to get in the bathroom,

182
00:10:58,166 --> 00:10:59,500
that's for sure!

183
00:10:59,583 --> 00:11:01,250
I'll bet this kind of
stuff wouldn't happen

184
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:02,708
if you acted nicer!

185
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:04,708
I can still
take ya, kid!

186
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:08,791
Oh? Piggy
piggy piggy! Piggy!

187
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:11,291
[grunting]

188
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:13,791
[intense diarrhea]

189
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:15,875
I'll get you for this!

190
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:18,916
[GOKU laughing]

191
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,666
Well, I need my
motorcycle now, Oolong!

192
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:23,958
You lazy...

193
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:30,625
Huh? Hey, this
isn't exactly what

194
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:32,500
I had in mind, Oolong!

195
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:35,125
Me either, toots.

196
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:37,625
Oh well. Let's go.

197
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:43,666
Can't you do
anything right?!

198
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,708
What do we do now, pork chop?

199
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:48,416
Look, you amazon!

200
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,583
Do you think it's fun being
squashed to the ground

201
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:52,375
by a horse like you?!

202
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:55,500
So that's the
thanks I get.

203
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:56,750
What's the use anyway?

204
00:11:56,833 --> 00:11:58,791
I can only hold a new
shape for five minutes,

205
00:11:58,875 --> 00:11:59,791
then--poof!

206
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,500
Everyone thinks
shape-changing makes you

207
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:06,708
stronger that you really are,
but it don't. I couldn't even

208
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:09,041
carry you outta
here, if I wanted to.

209
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:11,291
But, I've got another idea.

210
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:13,416
[screaming]

211
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:16,291
Here, how's this, Bulma?

212
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:19,958
[OOLONG] Put me on and then
only one of us has to walk!

213
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:24,166
You pervert! Take that!

214
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,416
Next time, maybe you
should try being her hat!

215
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,541
[NARRATOR ] Continuing
their journey on foot,

216
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:54,666
Bulma, Oolong, and
Goku press on into the

217
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:58,666
uncharted,
unexplored. and uncool.

218
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:02,750
[panting]

219
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:05,708
I gave up riding my
cloud to walk with you two,

220
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:07,083
now try and keep up!

221
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:09,375
[BULMA] Just remember:
you're not a city kid, Goku.

222
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:11,666
You're used to the
wilderness, but I'm not!

223
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,333
I should be pampered!

224
00:13:13,416 --> 00:13:15,625
My gosh, look
at this place!

225
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:18,208
[OOLONG] Yeah,
something's not right.

226
00:13:18,291 --> 00:13:20,625
I keep getting the
feeling we're being watched.

227
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:22,500
It's giving me the creeps!

228
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:25,625
I can't stand
it! I'm going crazy!

229
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:26,750
Are you giving up?

230
00:13:26,833 --> 00:13:31,708
[BULMA] No! Yes...
Maybe? I don't know!

231
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:35,625
I want a bath!
I need air-conditioning!

232
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:37,916
I don't want to be stranded
in the desert without a

233
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,083
boyfriend or my
Dyno-Caps anymore!

234
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:41,875
Her passion for
self-centeredness

235
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:43,375
inspires even me.

236
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:45,750
You sure are strange,
Oolong.

237
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:48,541
[BULMA] Ahh, shade.
Nap-time...

238
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:51,083
I say we just let
her rest for a while.

239
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:52,791
Suits me!

240
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:56,958
I sure am hungry. Uhh.

241
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:02,708
[CAT] Victims.

242
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:10,458
[CAT] Yamcha! Yamcha!

243
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:12,000
Victims! Woo hoo!

244
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:16,625
Well. it's about time.

245
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:18,291
[laughing]

246
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:25,583
[YAMCHA] We've had quite a dry
spell since we hijacked that

247
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:27,416
caravan, haven't we, Puar?

248
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,125
They're right down there,
Yamcha.

249
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:31,416
Can you see them?
Can you see them?

250
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,125
[YAMCHA] Only two? No problem.

251
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,791
[OOLONG] I'm starving over here!

252
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:40,333
I'm gonna go
find us some food.

253
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:42,500
Do you like bacon?

254
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:44,041
What are
you, brain dead?!

255
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:48,041
[OOLONG] I think I
hear something.

256
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:53,916
[humming]

257
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,291
[GOKU] What is it?

258
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:58,000
It ain't no camel!

259
00:14:58,083 --> 00:15:10,666
[engine roaring]

260
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:13,750
[giggling]

261
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:24,750
Greetings.

262
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:31,625
I am Yamcha.

263
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:34,166
I am master of the
land you trespass upon.

264
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:36,750
It's my land, too!

265
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:39,833
You needn't fear me.
Just hand over your money and

266
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:43,291
any Dyno-Caps you may have and
I will let you pass in peace.

267
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:45,250
You're Puar!

268
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:47,666
We went to
shape-shifting acadamy together.

269
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:48,708
[PUAR] I remember!

270
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:50,291
And you were a
loud-mouthed bully!

271
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:52,958
He always picked on me and stole
my lunch money, because I was

272
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:54,458
smaller than him!

273
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,458
I'd say the tables
have turned, my friend.

274
00:15:57,541 --> 00:15:59,625
How does it feel to
face someone bigger

275
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:01,250
than yourself, little piglet?

276
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:02,625
This guy looks pretty tough,
kid.

277
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:03,916
Think you can take him?

278
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,750
It's just like in the old days.

279
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:10,375
The swine still hides behind
someone whenever he's afraid!

280
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:11,833
Not much courage, huh?

281
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:12,916
That's right!

282
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,041
Not an ounce of
courage on that porker!

283
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:20,166
Puar, if I ever
get my hands on you...

284
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:21,833
Sounds like you
haven't changed much over

285
00:16:21,916 --> 00:16:23,666
the years, Oolong.

286
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,666
Okay boys, enough talk.

287
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:29,291
Either hand over your goods
or prepare to fight me.

288
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:33,583
Just how strong
are you Goku?

289
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:34,916
I'm super strong.

290
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,250
All right, big shot!

291
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:38,208
The bigger you are
the harder you fall!

292
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:41,375
You may think you're looking at
an easy haul here, but my man

293
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:44,541
will slap you two silly before
it's all said and done!

294
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:50,166
[YAMCHA] Prepare to
defend yourself.

295
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,250
[PUAR] Make pork chops
out of him, Yamcha!

296
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:55,125
He can't talk to you like that!

297
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,916
[OOLONG] Just a second.

298
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,916
All right! Destroy
'em little buddy!

299
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,125
Oolong, why should I
want to destroy this guy?

300
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:03,250
Did he hurt somebody?

301
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:04,875
[OOLONG] Haven't you
been listening, kid?

302
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:07,250
That sword isn't made
outta rubber you know.

303
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:09,041
He plans to kill us!

304
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:11,166
[GOKU] I don't want to fight
you, but if I have to defend

305
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:13,250
my friends, I will!

306
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:15,500
I admire your bravery, kid.

307
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:17,500
Is it bravery or stupidity?

308
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:21,500
[snoring]

309
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:23,750
Geez, I thought
it was an earthquake!

310
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:27,291
[snoring]

311
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:36,083
Hyaah!

312
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:39,000
Hi-ya!

313
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,125
Hyaah!

314
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:04,750
[clank]

315
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:08,750
Power Pole, extend!

316
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:17,333
Unbelievable!

317
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:18,458
Believe it!

318
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:20,166
The kid's winning
this one, isn't he?!

319
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:24,875
You have great power for
a little one, don't you?

320
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:27,250
[GOKU] Thank you.
My Grandpa trained me.

321
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:30,625
[YAMCHA] Ahh. The pole.
the extending Power Pole.

322
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:33,375
Only one man could
have given that to you.

323
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:35,958
Who is this
grandfather of yours?

324
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:38,125
His name was Gohan.

325
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:41,000
And he died a long time ago.

326
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:43,500
I knew of him.
But even with your magic pole

327
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:45,500
and all that he
may have taught you,

328
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:48,916
I'm afraid you are
still no match for me.

329
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,666
[YAMCHA] I will
have that pole's power.

330
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:53,833
Give it to me or prepare
to fight to the death!

331
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:56,625
Uh-oh.
We're lunch meat now!

332
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:02,750
I'm starving!

333
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:07,541
You're not the only one
with special powers, kid.

334
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:11,125
Watch this!

335
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:16,708
Wolf Fang Fist!

336
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:19,041
[wolf howling]

337
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:22,291
--[wolf howling]

338
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:25,916

339
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,583
[blow landing]

340
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:33,041
[blows landing]

341
00:19:34,958 --> 00:19:43,875
[crashing]

342
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:46,250
[OOLONG] Guess we
won't need a headstone.

343
00:19:49,791 --> 00:19:51,708
Why do I always
back the loser?

344
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:54,000
Why does it always
have to happen this way??

345
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:55,875
Now he'll come for me!

346
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:58,750
[OOLONG] Gee, I'd love to
stay and fight with you,

347
00:19:58,833 --> 00:19:59,791
but I gotta fly!

348
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:05,416
Now's your chance, Puar!

349
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,208
Get him!

350
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:08,375
Right. With pleasure!

351
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:15,291
You mangy mongrel!

352
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:17,416
What'dya go and do that for?

353
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:20,208
I owed you one, Oolong!

354
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:23,875
[YAMCHA] Now, my worthless
adversary, either hand over what

355
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:26,250
you have or join your friend.

356
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:28,000
That's a choice, huh?

357
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:31,541
There's absolutely nothing
worse than getting ripped off.

358
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:32,708
[YAMCHA] Make it snappy, pig.

359
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:34,958
My patience with
you is wearing thin.

360
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:38,916
[rumbling]

361
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,416
Gotta get some food...

362
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,166
[YAMCHA] Thank you!

363
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:43,375
[GOKU] Hold It!

364
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:45,583
Right now, I've had just
about enough of you!

365
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:47,916
If you've truly had enough, kid.

366
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,083
go back to sleep
amongst the rubble and

367
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:52,500
don't provoke me again.

368
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:57,125
Come on. I'm just
getting warmed up, you know.

369
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:10,541
[blows landing]

370
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:13,833
[crash]

371
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:18,666
That's it, kid!

372
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:22,791
[shouting]

373
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:25,375
Oh boy, I think I'm
gonna die if I don't get

374
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:26,625
something to eat.

375
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:28,458
Why're you just
standing there Goku?

376
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:29,375
Do something!

377
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:33,875
[screaming]

378
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:35,166
Gee whiz, you guys.

379
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:36,791
What's all the screaming about?

380
00:21:45,958 --> 00:21:47,666
[YAMCHA] She's gorgeous!

381
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:54,125
[tea kettle whistling]

382
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:58,333
Master, you okay?

383
00:21:58,416 --> 00:22:01,583
Puar, you know I have
trouble around beautiful women!

384
00:22:01,666 --> 00:22:02,541
I know.

385
00:22:08,458 --> 00:22:11,708
Well, I guess we put
them on the run, didn't we?

386
00:22:11,791 --> 00:22:13,708
Hey, you guys,
who was that hunk?

387
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:15,833
He looked absolutely dreamy!

388
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:20,333
Oh, wow!

389
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:21,833
Can we eat now?

390
00:22:24,041 --> 00:22:27,291
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile,
back in Yamcha's hideout.

391
00:22:27,375 --> 00:22:30,625
[YAMCHA] A warrior toppled
by a girl is humiliating!

392
00:22:30,708 --> 00:22:33,208
Yamcha, she had
nothing to do with it.

393
00:22:33,291 --> 00:22:35,208
You just tripped!

394
00:22:36,083 --> 00:22:40,500
That's a lie, Puar!
I froze when I saw her.

395
00:22:40,583 --> 00:22:43,208
But I will overcome
my fear of women.

396
00:22:43,291 --> 00:22:47,041
Those fools have not
heard the last of Yamcha!

397
00:22:47,125 --> 00:22:49,208
[NARRATOR] It would seem that
our heroes haven't seen the last

398
00:22:49,291 --> 00:22:52,916
of Yamcha, the desert
bandit. Join us again for the

399
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,291
next episode of Dragon Ball!
