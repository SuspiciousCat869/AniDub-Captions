1
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:14,875
[NARRATOR] The sensational
World Martial Arts Tournament

2
00:02:14,958 --> 00:02:18,333
has ended with Jackie Chun
capturing the win from Goku.

3
00:02:18,416 --> 00:02:20,875
Our hero has no idea that
his opponent was really

4
00:02:20,958 --> 00:02:22,958
Master Roshi in disguise,

5
00:02:23,041 --> 00:02:25,958
or of the exciting
adventure that lies ahead!

6
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:27,416
[YAMCHA] So, are you up
for a second helping

7
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,125
of training on
Master Roshi's island?

8
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:31,958
You bet!

9
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:33,000
Now hold on!

10
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:34,458
Let's not get
ahead of ourselves.

11
00:02:34,541 --> 00:02:35,666
You boys have
earned a break

12
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:38,250
before we begin the
next phase of training.

13
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:39,625
It's time you
learned some lessons

14
00:02:39,708 --> 00:02:43,583
from the greatest
scholar of all: Life!

15
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:44,666
Really?

16
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,166
[ROSHI] Um-hum

17
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,375
Great, then I'm gonna go

18
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:50,125
find my Grandpa's
Four-Star Dragon Ball!

19
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:51,541
Huh?

20
00:02:51,625 --> 00:02:53,291
What's the rush?

21
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:54,375
There's plenty of time.

22
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:56,250
Are you sure you
wanna start looking now?

23
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:57,166
Mm-hmm.

24
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:58,250
Wait a minute!

25
00:02:58,333 --> 00:02:59,791
What in the world
is a Dragon Ball?

26
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:02,375
It's a magical ball
my grandpa gave me.

27
00:03:02,458 --> 00:03:03,958
Oh.

28
00:03:04,041 --> 00:03:07,041
Mmmm... Maybe you should take
someone should go with you...

29
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:09,625
I'll have the flying nimbus
to keep me company.

30
00:03:09,708 --> 00:03:12,083
[OOLONG] Goku! He's right.

31
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:14,375
You going out
alone is a bad idea.

32
00:03:14,458 --> 00:03:16,000
It's too scary!

33
00:03:16,791 --> 00:03:18,791
It'll be an adventure!

34
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:21,125
I'm sure Krillin
would love to go!

35
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:23,458
Uh...? Actually,
Master, I was looking

36
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:25,041
forward to going with
you to your island

37
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:27,916
so we could start training
for the next tournament.

38
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,375
Hmm?!

39
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:31,083
Look, kid, what do I have
to do, spell it out for you?

40
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:32,250
I need you to leave! Scram!

41
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:34,000
You're cramping my style!

42
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:37,375
In the next tournament
I want to score big!

43
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:39,541
So do I.

44
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:42,208
[ROSHI thinking]
More than you'll ever know.

45
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:43,416
I can see it now.

46
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:48,458
Cocktails at sunset.
A gorgeous gal, Launch!

47
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:52,208
[ROSHI thinking] Yes!

48
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:56,208
Nice dress, big blue
eyes, big ohh--ha!

49
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:59,041
Total hottie captivated
by my rugged good looks!

50
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:02,166
And not another soul around...

51
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,416
Oh, well.

52
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,833
I guess there goes that
little slice of heaven.

53
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:07,666
Where are you going?

54
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,000
Uh...

55
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:10,916
I guess the rest of us
will go back to West City.

56
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,125
Yeah, that'll be fun.

57
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:14,875
A nice relaxing drive
across the desert.

58
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:16,125
Yeah, there you go kids.

59
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:18,250
Get out there and see the world.

60
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:20,125
Master?

61
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:22,208
Yes?! What?

62
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:24,708
Does that box have
my things inside of it?

63
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:26,875
Yes, and it's called a suitcase.

64
00:04:26,958 --> 00:04:28,333
Wow! A suitcase...

65
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:30,833
I'll never get used
to all this great stuff!

66
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:32,583
You really need
to get out more...

67
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:34,375
This trip'll do you good.

68
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:37,083
Boy, sure are a lot
of magazines in here!

69
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:40,291
[ROSHI] Uhh...
You better get a move on, kid!

70
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:41,791
Yep!

71
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:43,541
Nimbus!

72
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:46,416
Hi there, Nimbus.

73
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:48,958
He flies on a cloud,

74
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:51,583
but he still goes
ga-ga over a suitcase.

75
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:54,000
Mm-hm. Naïve.

76
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:55,291
[KRILLIN] Hey, Goku!

77
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:57,375
On second thought, you're
gonna need my help.

78
00:04:57,458 --> 00:04:58,625
Thanks.

79
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:00,708
But you can't ride the
Nimbus cloud. Remember?

80
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:02,958
Oh yeah... Never mind.

81
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:05,416
The Dragon
Radar will guide you.

82
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,541
You do know how
to use it, right?

83
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:10,041
I'll figure it out.

84
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:12,750
Time to find my Dragon Ball!

85
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:14,500
Be careful!

86
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:17,333
Bye! Bye, bye!

87
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:20,833
[BULMA] Good luck, kid!

88
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:23,875
[PUAR] So long, then!

89
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:32,958
I kinda feel bad
letting him go all alone.

90
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:35,458
Something tells me
he'll be just fine!

91
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:39,458
[ROSHI] He's a special boy.

92
00:05:39,541 --> 00:05:41,458
Mmmm! Very special.

93
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:43,125
Mm-hmm!

94
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,500
[NARRATOR] And so,
Goku must part company

95
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:50,416
with his friends as
he sets out in pursuit

96
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,916
of the Four-Star Dragon Ball.

97
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,083
The future is
unclear for our hero,

98
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:56,583
but one thing is certain:

99
00:05:56,666 --> 00:05:59,083
the adventure has just begun!

100
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,333
[BULMA] Oh!

101
00:06:16,416 --> 00:06:19,250
Are you trying to hit every
hole in the street or what?

102
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:21,208
[YAMCHA] Actually,
there is no street...

103
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:23,333
That's why it's
called off-road driving,

104
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:24,791
and I'm doing the best I can.

105
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:27,333
You can take the
wheel any time you want.

106
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:29,833
Oh-h, can I...?

107
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:32,375
Anything would be
better than this torture!

108
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:34,708
I've never seen
Bulma this upset.

109
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:37,166
She does seem
a bit irritable.

110
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:38,708
I am not upset, got it?!

111
00:06:38,791 --> 00:06:41,458
This is me happy!

112
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:43,541
[OOLONG] Right. We can tell.

113
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:45,416
[BULMA] Be quiet!

114
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,666
Master Roshi
said he'd wait

115
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,625
for me right here
while I got my ice cream.

116
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:00,125
Is this a test?

117
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:04,708
Ah, Eureka!

118
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:08,166
Satin, lace, little straps! Ooh!

119
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:11,166
I betcha they have the
type you can eat, too.

120
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:15,458
Yeh-heh!
Roshi, behave yourself!

121
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:22,083
Hee-Hee-Hee!

122
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:23,541
Actually, I did promise myself

123
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:25,750
I'd get Launch a souvenir!

124
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:27,541
How can I help you?

125
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:32,416
Something wrong?

126
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:36,416
Well, uh...

127
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:39,041
I was wondering if
you'd help me, eh...

128
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:42,166
...test these undies out...

129
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:44,833
You know...
for quality control...

130
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:45,833
Sir, please!

131
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:47,208
I don't know what
to say to that!

132
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:51,250
I'll... buy several...
and who knows...

133
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:52,416
if I like what I see,

134
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,875
there might be a tip
in it for you, too!

135
00:07:55,958 --> 00:08:00,708
Is--that--yes--or--no?!
Heh heh heh.

136
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:02,541
Ugh!

137
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:05,875
[ROSHI] Heh-heh-heh-heh!

138
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:12,125
[GOKU] Let's see... Got one!

139
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:14,333
Sure looks real far away!

140
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:25,000
[NAM'S BROTHER]
Did you do it, Nam?

141
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:27,041
Did you win the tournament?

142
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:28,125
Nuh-uh...

143
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:32,666
Then truly all is lost.

144
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:35,666
Not yet... I did get water!

145
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:38,208
We're saved!

146
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:41,708
Here it is!

147
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:43,666
A bit small.

148
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:47,125
Everybody stand back!

149
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:06,291
[shocked, surprised noises]

150
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:07,541
[VILLAGE ELDER] Praise you...

151
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:10,083
You have brought a
ray of hope to the people.

152
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:12,250
I am very grateful
to help my village,

153
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:15,750
but it is the tournament we must
thank for this prosperity...

154
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:18,416
You see... all seemed lost...

155
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:21,416
[NAM] After losing the match,
I fell into despair.

156
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,208
That is when I met Master Roshi.

157
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:25,333
It was he who gave me the
Dyno-cap which was empty.

158
00:09:25,416 --> 00:09:27,791
He explained how it could
hold an abundance of water,

159
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:30,083
for there it was
plentiful and free.

160
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:31,291
You can fit vast quantities

161
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:33,375
of anything you want...

162
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:37,750
We are truly fortunate
to receive such a gift.

163
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:48,500
[NAM] I fear the
water I have brought

164
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:51,291
will not sustain us long...
It is most strange.

165
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:52,625
We have been through
droughts before,

166
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:55,750
but I do not remember
the river ever drying up.

167
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:57,125
[VILLAGE ELDER]
That's because it hasn't.

168
00:09:57,208 --> 00:09:58,541
At least, not like this.

169
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:01,375
It is as if the desert inhaled
the river in one breath.

170
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:04,208
I've never seen anything
quite like this occur.

171
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:08,541
Perhaps there is some problem
upstream, at the source.

172
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:10,125
Like what?

173
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:12,541
You mean something unnatural?

174
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:13,916
There's no telling.

175
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,375
To be honest with you,
I'm just grasping at straws.

176
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:19,375
In all my life, I've never
seen the village hit this bad.

177
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:23,291
It's almost like we're being
punished for some misdeed.

178
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:26,041
Don't let it get
you down, my boy.

179
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,000
All we need is a miracle.

180
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:29,833
Is such a thing possible?

181
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:32,166
Hm-mm. Anything's possible.

182
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,500
Just look at the Roaming Lake.

183
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:37,375
A Roaming Lake...?
Can this be?

184
00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:39,333
When I was a child,

185
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:41,791
my father told me the story
of a nearby village crippled

186
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:43,125
by a terrible drought.

187
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:45,250
One day, a lake moved
across the ground

188
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:47,166
and settled at the
base of the village.

189
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:48,625
It quenched their thirst,
fed their crops,

190
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:51,666
then left as quietly as it came.

191
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:55,000
I will find it.

192
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:57,833
If this Roaming Lake exists,

193
00:10:57,916 --> 00:10:59,666
I will lead it to our village.

194
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,958
Tell the people their
suffering will soon end,

195
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:04,458
for I will not
return without it.

196
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:13,750
Whew!

197
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:16,333
I will not tire.

198
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:18,458
Huh?

199
00:11:27,291 --> 00:11:29,583
[NAM] My turn!

200
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:32,333
I call upon...

201
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:35,875
...the Aerial Attack!!!

202
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:37,041
Swift as lightning!

203
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:39,708
Loud as thund--Huh?

204
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:56,041
Well, guess who's
coming to dinner?

205
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:58,625
Let go, now!

206
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:07,250
Water... Need some water...

207
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:13,291
Hey!!

208
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,500
Wow! Big Puddle!

209
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:27,750
Ahh! Yeah... this is great!

210
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:33,958
[NAM] Unhand me, bird brain!

211
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:35,250
Huh?

212
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:37,333
C'mon, put me down,
you stupid bird!

213
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:38,875
You're going to make me mad!

214
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:40,541
I've got to make you go!

215
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:43,125
I've got to get
water for my people!

216
00:12:58,333 --> 00:12:59,833
It's Nam!

217
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:11,625
Nimbus!! Go!

218
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:17,625
Faster!!

219
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:21,500
[NAM] Oh, Goku!

220
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:24,250
[GOKU] Don't worry.
I'll get you down! Hang on!

221
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:25,833
I am hanging on!

222
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:27,375
How did this happen?

223
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:29,125
My village needs more water.

224
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:30,416
I was searching
along the riverbed,

225
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,458
when this beast captured me!

226
00:13:32,541 --> 00:13:35,208
I'll help!
Drop him off, now!

227
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:37,625
Do I look like a taxi service?!

228
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:42,791
Hey, you should watch
where you swing that tail.

229
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:44,125
You almost knocked me down!

230
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:45,708
If you don't leave me alone,

231
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:47,375
I'll do more than that!

232
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:54,291
This piece of meat
is my dinner, kid,

233
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:57,041
but now that I look at him,
he is kind of scrawny.

234
00:13:57,125 --> 00:13:59,750
I'm sure I'll have
room for dessert!

235
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:05,500
Power Pole extend!

236
00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:07,125
You're a bad bird!

237
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:27,583
That sure was a big mean bird.

238
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:29,416
With sharp claws!

239
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,958
Ah! Stop it! What
are you doing?!

240
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:32,500
Oh, you are a boy!

241
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:34,791
Yes, yes, I am!

242
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:36,708
Sorry, it's hard
to tell sometimes.

243
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:38,500
You can check me if you want!

244
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:39,666
[NAM] No.

245
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,916
Just so you know,
the people in my village

246
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,375
greet others by
shaking hands. Period.

247
00:14:57,166 --> 00:14:59,875
Too bad someone forgot
to pack extra gasoline.

248
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:01,708
A shame it won't
run on good looks.

249
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:03,583
I'd keep it going forever.

250
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:08,041
Okay, look...
we can't just sit here.

251
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:09,166
I know, you could change into

252
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:11,875
an umbrella and
give us some shade

253
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:13,291
Oh, joy!

254
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:14,875
Don't listen to him.

255
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:17,166
I'll bet he doesn't even know
how to change into an umbrella.

256
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,708
Oh yes I do.

257
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:21,583
I went to the same Shape-
Shifting School you did, Puar.

258
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:23,791
Until you got expelled
in the first semester

259
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:25,875
for stealing
the teacher's papers!

260
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:28,083
Don't you ever stop talking?

261
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:30,750
Fine, I'll do it!!!

262
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:36,625
Hey, how about a fan?

263
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:44,750
This is much better.

264
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:47,625
[YAMCHA] It sure beats
baking in the sun.

265
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:51,833
Yep.. that's me...
bacon in the sun!

266
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:55,000
[NAM] I appreciate
your assistance Goku.

267
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:57,083
With this flying cloud
we can survey the river

268
00:15:57,166 --> 00:16:00,208
and keep a look-out for the
Roaming Lake at the same time.

269
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:02,125
[GOKU] How far
does the river go?

270
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:03,541
[NAM] Far...

271
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:05,250
Very Far...

272
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,333
[NARRATOR]
Braving the harsh elements,

273
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:11,208
Goku and Nam eventually discover

274
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:14,458
a section of the river with
water and lush vegetation.

275
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:17,625
The green trees and blue
water offer a stark contrast

276
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:19,750
to the rest of the
desolate landscape.

277
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:22,458
It is a sight to behold
for the weary travelers.

278
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:25,708
But what lies beyond
is even more astonishing.

279
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,083
Un-believable...!

280
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:30,291
[NAM] The water flow is
being choked by that dam.

281
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:32,083
Who could be
responsible for this?

282
00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:35,041
Set us down my friend,
so we can investigate.

283
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:39,958
Hey, those guys look familiar!

284
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:42,333
How can these beasts
horde so much water?

285
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:44,958
I will ask whomever leads
them to set the river free.

286
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:46,291
Okay!

287
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:51,625
The dam stays put, got it?!

288
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:53,916
[NAM] I do not understand
your resistance to this!

289
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,500
It is completely unacceptable!

290
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:56,750
How can you lay claim

291
00:16:56,833 --> 00:16:58,916
to that which rightfully
belongs to everyone?!

292
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,666
You can no sooner own the
water than the sky above us!

293
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:04,500
Would you be so quick to
open the dam if you owned it?

294
00:17:04,583 --> 00:17:05,875
My friend doesn't
understand you.

295
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:08,291
He only speaks the
language of money!

296
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:12,458
My village is poor.

297
00:17:12,541 --> 00:17:15,208
We have nothing to
offer but our gratitude.

298
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:17,166
Then we have nothing to give.

299
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,208
Please, I beg you.

300
00:17:18,291 --> 00:17:20,333
Yes, you're good at that!

301
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,083
Please, my people
are dying of thirst!

302
00:17:25,166 --> 00:17:26,625
If they are thirsty,

303
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:28,791
let them drink the sand...

304
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:40,250
You little insect!
Tear him apart!

305
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:47,583
Heh-heh! What's this, your pet?

306
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:50,208
If you want him,
you gotta go through me!

307
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:52,666
Oh yeah? Sounds fun.

308
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:53,875
Let's introduce this runt

309
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:55,833
to the meaning of pain!

310
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:03,333
What the heck was that?

311
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:04,833
Wha--

312
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:09,125
Uh, hey boss.

313
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:10,375
You're Goku...

314
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:13,583
Uh... Hey! It's Giran!

315
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:15,708
This little pip-squeak
knows you?

316
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:17,666
This "little pip-squeak"
is the one who beat me

317
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:21,833
in the tournament...
so show him some respect!

318
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:24,583
I remember you
from the tour-r-na-m-en-t.

319
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:26,916
You're not still sore about
losing the match are you?

320
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,666
I was humiliated!

321
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:31,583
But that has nothing to do with
the dam you want to destroy.

322
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:34,791
It is a magnificent structure,
built long before any of us.

323
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:37,500
I would be happy to release
the water, but I can't.

324
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:38,875
The dam is impossible to break

325
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:41,625
because it is held together
by Merry-go-round Gum.

326
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:43,458
It is very much...

327
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:45,583
...unbreakable.

328
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:51,708
Then I have failed
my entire village!

329
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:54,041
I can break the dam for you!

330
00:18:54,958 --> 00:18:56,125
You think so?

331
00:18:56,208 --> 00:18:58,708
Well, sure... I'll try to.

332
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:11,583
Ka...

333
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:12,708
me...

334
00:19:12,791 --> 00:19:13,500
ha...

335
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:14,333
me...

336
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:17,333
HAA!

337
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:34,000
He really did it!

338
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:39,375
So much for the
Merry-go-round Gum.

339
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:45,458
You did it!

340
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:47,083
That was fun!

341
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:50,416
Hahahahaha!

342
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:53,125
[GIRAN] You are one amazing kid.

343
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:01,666
[GOKU] This is great!

344
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:04,125
Now we can all
go swimming, yeah!

345
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:07,000
Thanks to you, there are
many things we can do now.

346
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:09,458
This will be a
day long remembered.

347
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:18,208
[BULMA] Darn it!

348
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:19,750
Just when I was
starting to feel tanned!

349
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:22,458
Well, I hope
everyone is happy!

350
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:24,250
Once again,
I sacrifice my own comfort

351
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:26,875
and safety for the group,
and what thanks do I get?

352
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:28,458
I get dropped on my keister!

353
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:29,875
I'm a mess.

354
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:32,375
I've got sand in places
I didn't even know I had places!

355
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:33,625
It's okay, cheer up!

356
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:35,916
This storm caught
us all by surprise.

357
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:36,916
You did a good job.

358
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,250
It's not easy to do.

359
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:39,750
Too bad you got expelled
or you might have learned

360
00:20:39,833 --> 00:20:40,833
how to concentrate and

361
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:43,375
hold a shape for
more than five minutes.

362
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:46,916
How about I concentrate
on busting your... Ahhh!

363
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:50,666
[YAMCHA] Come on! Hurry!

364
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,250
We have to get inside the car!

365
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:54,708
This storm is getting
worse by the minute!

366
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,125
[VILLAGE MAN] It's over.

367
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:38,666
The desert has robbed us

368
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:41,083
of our last hope for salvation.

369
00:21:42,958 --> 00:21:44,458
Whoa!

370
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,833
[GOKU] Oohh!
It's that big puddle!

371
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:54,375
[NAM] The Roaming Lake!
It does exist!

372
00:21:58,125 --> 00:21:59,208
I never thought I'd see

373
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:01,208
the day my father's
words would come

374
00:22:01,291 --> 00:22:02,958
to pass before my very eyes!

375
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:05,750
Tonight we have
been smiled upon.

376
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:07,750
It's beautiful.

377
00:22:07,833 --> 00:22:11,333
Yes. This has
been a day of miracles.

378
00:22:11,416 --> 00:22:13,750
It has brought us you, Goku!

379
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:22,291
Huh?

380
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:24,583
Oh no!

381
00:22:25,208 --> 00:22:26,958
[YAMCHA] South City.

382
00:22:27,041 --> 00:22:28,208
I don't believe it.

383
00:22:28,291 --> 00:22:29,916
The storm blew us right
back were we started.

384
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,750
I need a vacation!

385
00:22:31,833 --> 00:22:33,583
I need a bath!

386
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,541
[NARRATOR] As the day
draws to a close,

387
00:22:37,625 --> 00:22:40,333
our hero has a
lot to smile about.

388
00:22:40,416 --> 00:22:42,708
By finding the Roaming Lake,
he has helped

389
00:22:42,791 --> 00:22:45,875
to secure the future
for Nam and his village.

390
00:22:45,958 --> 00:22:49,125
Now he flies on towards
his next exciting adventure

391
00:22:49,208 --> 00:22:53,125
as the search for the
Four-Star Dragon Ball continues.
