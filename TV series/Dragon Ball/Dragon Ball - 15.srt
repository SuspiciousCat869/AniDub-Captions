[NARRATOR] Previously on
Dragon Ball, Goku and his

00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:18,291
new acquaintance
Krillin set out on the

00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:22,541
Nimbus Cloud with a mission:
find a girl for Master Roshi

4
00:02:22,625 --> 00:02:25,708
to date! And until the
boys complete this task,

5
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:28,958
Master Roshi won't
teach them martial arts!

6
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:33,166
[GOKU] I wonder where
we should look...?

7
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:35,958
How about not
so high in the air?

[KRILLIN screaming]

00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:44,375
Slow down! You know
if I lose my grip on you,

10
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:46,583
I'll fall through this cloud!

11
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:49,000
Well, if you would stop
thinking bad thoughts,

12
00:02:49,083 --> 00:02:50,791
then it wouldn't be a problem!

13
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:52,250
[KRILLIN] Fat chance.

14
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:56,291
Hey, Krillin, look, do you
think Master Roshi would

15
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:57,750
like that lady over there?

16
00:02:57,833 --> 00:02:59,750
[KRILLIN] You mean I
have to look down?

17
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:06,333
[KRILLIN] Goku! That's a man!

18
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:08,958
[GOKU] Really?!
How can you tell?

19
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:12,291
Gosh, they all look
pretty much the same to me!

20
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:14,000
[KRILLIN] You're joking, right?

21
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:16,875
I mean you really
can't tell the difference?

22
00:03:16,958 --> 00:03:19,125
Well, usually I
can figure it out.

23
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:22,041
I just have to touch them first!

24
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:24,916
In case you can't tell,
I'm a boy.

You just leave them
plans to me, Tall Man!

29
00:04:23,041 --> 00:04:24,500

You think
we'll be alright?

Tubbs, you're an idiot.
The day I get bested by a

35
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:39,541
lone woman is the day I
sell my horse and go home.

36
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:56,875
Gosh! It's so dusty today
and I just washed my hair!

37
00:04:56,958 --> 00:04:58,458
It ain't her.

I don't know where I am...

00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,666
Barman, I'll pay for whatever
drink the lady wants.

Huh?

42

[TALL MAN] Hmm. Don't
ask me why, ma'am, but,

43
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:20,291
something about you reminds
me of a girl I once loved.

[MAN 2] Listen,
partner, we're on the look out!

[TALL MAN] Mind your own,
hear me?! Mind your own!

47
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:37,958
[TALL MAN] Sorry about that.
Now what can I get you?

48
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:40,208
There are so
many things I like!

49
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:43,625
How about a fresh glass
of orange juice over ice?

Hey, why does Master Roshi want
to meet a girl so bad anyway?

Well, I guess that he
likes going on dates just

as much as you like food!

How come he never
answers his door?

160
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:54,458
It is possible he's just
using the bathroom, Goku.

161
00:14:54,541 --> 00:14:56,458
Why's he taking a bath?

162
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:59,333
It's the nice way
of saying "toilet"!

163
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:01,000
You mean he's taking a poo?

164
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:03,625
Oh, I'll go tell him
to hurry up, okay?

165
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:09,500
That Goku's not one
for manners, is he?

166
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:11,708
Now, Krillin, you
still haven't told me

167
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:13,416
the reason that I'm here.

168
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,833
Yes, well, I'm not
really sure myself.

169
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:20,375
Master Roshi is a lonely guy who
likes to think he's a stud.

170
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:24,333
So we just need someone
to play along and feed his ego.

171
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:28,250
Oh, does that mean I can hide
here while I'm running away?

172
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:32,166
Running a...? You mean from
those guys who were attacking

173
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:34,791
you and pretending to
be police officers?

174
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:37,750
So, who were they really?

175
00:15:37,833 --> 00:15:40,958
They were real policemen!

176
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:42,416
U-Uh?

177
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:50,083
[GOKU] Uh, Master Roshi!
Get off the toilet!

178
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:52,625
There's a girl downstairs!

179
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:56,875
[ROSHI] Darn it, Goku!
I said hold on!

180
00:15:56,958 --> 00:16:01,166
[toilet flushing]

181
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:03,458
Do you have to scream
it all over the house?!

182
00:16:03,541 --> 00:16:06,000
It's plain embarrassing!

183
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:07,750
[GOKU] You're stinky!

184
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:11,416
And why exactly would
the police be after you?

185
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:15,875
I can't say for sure,
but judging from all

186
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:19,416
the money in my bag, I
probably held up a bank or two.

187
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:24,458
[ROSHI] I sure hope you brought
me a nice one this time...

188
00:16:24,541 --> 00:16:26,583
[GOKU] I guess so?
Whenever Krillin sees her,

189
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:28,125
he smiles a whole lot.

190
00:16:29,916 --> 00:16:31,708
Something about a train...?

191
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:34,125
[KRILLIN laughing]

192
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:35,791
Oh, right,
you're a train-robber.

193
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:37,708
You expect me to believe that?

194
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,500
[KRILLIN] You're so
silly, Launch.

195
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:48,375
[KRILLIN] Robbing trains
and stuff is a job for

196
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:51,833
big strong guys, and
you're a pretty girl!

197
00:16:51,916 --> 00:16:55,750
[LAUNCH] You might want to
watch what you say, Krillin.

198
00:16:57,333 --> 00:17:03,541
When I sneeze, I change, and
terrible things can happen!

199
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:05,958
[KRILLIN] You mean
like a runny nose?

200
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:07,791
[ROSHI] Hi!

201
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:11,708
I think I'm in love!

202
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:13,375
That's good, right?

203
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:15,708
Oh my goodness,
you frightened me!

204
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:20,000
So, Master Roshi,
what do you think of her?

205
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:24,666
She's been making up some silly
stories about robbing trains,

206
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:27,458
but other than that,
she totally fits the bill.

207
00:17:27,541 --> 00:17:28,875
[ROSHI] Mm-hmm!

208
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:31,916
I'm making you both my
students from this day forward!

209
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:36,041
[GOKU and KRILLIN] Yeah!

210
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:40,750
Hey! I'm Master Roshi,
and this is my pad!

211
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:44,625
Nice to meet you, sir.
My name is Launch.

212
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:48,875
Your grandsons saved me from
a whole lot of trouble today.

213
00:17:48,958 --> 00:17:51,333
Oh, is that
really true, boys?

214
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:52,541
[chuckling]

215
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:55,541
Yes, I can't thank them enough.

216
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:58,583
All in a day's work.

217
00:17:58,666 --> 00:18:03,333
I'm glad you're safe, but to be
honest they're not my grandsons.

218
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:04,666
Oh.

219
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,666
They're my younger brothers!

220
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:10,625
[ROSHI] It was worth a try.

221
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:12,208
[laughing]

222
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:14,000
Funny joke, wasn't it?

223
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:15,291
[LAUNCH laughing]

224
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:16,708
Oh, yes!

225
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:19,916
Actually, I'm the
Turtle Hermit Master Roshi,

226
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,541
the world's greatest expert at
martial arts, and these boys

227
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:25,666
have come to train under me.

228
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:30,541
Martial arts, huh? Well, that
explains why Goku's so strong.

229
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:34,375
Yes, I'm happy to hear my
lessons made a difference.

230
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:38,333
But, Master Roshi, you haven't
taught me anything yet.

231
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:42,083
So, anyway, Launch, since
you're my special guest and all,

232
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:45,000
how would you like to take
a romantic walk with me

233
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:47,166
around my island paradise?

234
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:56,791
Well... it doesn't
look like a very long walk.

235
00:18:56,875 --> 00:18:59,791
[LAUNCH] But yeah,
that sounds pleasant to me.

236
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:02,791
[ROSHI] Y-You mean it?! Oh boy!

237
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:05,333
[ROSHI laughing]

238
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:07,750
[KRILLIN] I think he
liked that answer.

239
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:12,000
And while you're here,
you might as well study

240
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:13,625
martial arts with us too.

241
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:15,583
I... don't know...

242
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:19,000
I have soft hands,
and I've never been

243
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:21,083
very interested in fighting.

244
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:24,916
Well, there are many benefits
of martial arts besides

245
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,833
being able to beat the
tar out of people, you know.

246
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:30,208
[ROSHI] It increases
your physical stamina,

247
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:33,666
it's good for the noggin',
and... it... uh, it's good

248
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,041
on your oily pores.

249
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:37,541
I wouldn't pass up
this opportunity, Launch!

250
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:41,666
Master Roshi is a legend
in the martial arts world!

251
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:44,375
[KRILLIN] Lots of people
would do anything for a

252
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:47,750
lesson from him.
It's like a collector's item.

253
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:51,416
Wow! Then of course I will.

254
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:57,583
Yeah... I guess there's no
point in denying my greatness.

255
00:19:57,666 --> 00:20:00,083
Can we please start now?

256
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:03,250
Thanks for the plug, kid.

257
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:05,166
You know I aim to please.

258
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:07,958
[GOKU] Where's he going now?

259
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:14,625
First, let's put
our uniforms on!

260
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:15,916
Right!

261
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,375
[GOKU] Uniforms?

262
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,666
Woah, you can change in
the house, if you want!

263
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:27,958
Okay.

264
00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:30,291
Yes, that's a good idea.

265
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:34,125
Now why in the world did you
have to bring that up?!

266
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:35,583
I panicked...

267
00:20:36,791 --> 00:20:38,166
[ROSHI] Hurry up and
change into these!

268
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,458
[GOKU] Eww! I'm
not wearing that!

269
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:43,083
[ROSHI] You will if
you want lessons!

270
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:45,250
This is the only way
my plan will work!

271
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:52,166
[LAUNCH] I'm back!

272
00:20:57,625 --> 00:21:00,583
This looks like underwear...

273
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:06,708
Oh, no, it's... uh....
"Turtle Hermit Fighting Armor"!

274
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:08,250
Clever name...

275
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:12,375
[LAUNCH] Okay, but it doesn't
seem to protect much...

276
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:19,166
[ROSHI] I knew these outfits
would come in handy.

277
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:22,708
Now we'll start
off with aerobics!

278
00:21:25,791 --> 00:21:27,166
Would ya leave
me alone!

279
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:34,833
[sniffing]

280
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:37,166
Ah... ah...!

281
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:38,583
Oh, it's coming!

282
00:21:38,666 --> 00:21:41,375
Ah... ah... ahchoo!

283
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:48,000
[LAUNCH growling]

284
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:55,291
Okay, boys, whose
idea was this?!

285
00:21:55,375 --> 00:21:57,625
[LAUNCH] Wanna dress
me like a doll?!

286
00:21:57,708 --> 00:22:00,000
Well, then, please
don't forget...

287
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:02,458
[LAUNCH] the accessory
machine gun!

288
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:16,000
Oh dear! S-Sorry!

289
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:23,916
You see? My other half
comes out when I sneeze,

290
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,583
and she doesn't like
pigheaded boys!

291
00:22:26,666 --> 00:22:30,250
Did she do anything bad to you?

292
00:22:31,666 --> 00:22:34,791
Not... too... bad...

293
00:22:34,875 --> 00:22:36,291
[screaming]

294
00:22:36,375 --> 00:22:38,791
Oh... ow!

295
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:43,958
[NARRATOR] With the mysterious
Launch moving in, maybe the boys

296
00:22:44,041 --> 00:22:47,083
will learn to behave themselves.
At least, if they want to

297
00:22:47,166 --> 00:22:49,291
hold on to their skin.
