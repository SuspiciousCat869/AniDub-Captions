What in the world?

00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:18,708
[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball...

4
00:02:18,791 --> 00:02:20,583
Bulma and Krillin
discovered the key

5
00:02:20,666 --> 00:02:23,541
to unlocking their
wildest dreams!

6
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,625
Huh?

7
00:02:30,458 --> 00:02:32,333
[BULMA]
Some treasure!

8
00:02:36,625 --> 00:02:38,291
[BULMA]
This could be big trouble!

9
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:39,666
[KRILLIN]
Yeah!

10
00:02:40,916 --> 00:02:41,958
[BULMA, KRILLIN]
Huh?

[KRILLIN, BULMA]
Ooh!

14
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,583
[NARRATOR]
At last, the pirate's treasure

15
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:50,625
was within their grasp...

16
00:02:50,708 --> 00:02:52,916
The revelry was
short-lived, however,

17
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,291
as danger reared its
ugly head once more.

18
00:02:58,375 --> 00:03:00,541
[BULMA] You know what this
means, don't you?

19
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:01,833
[KRILLIN] What?
[BULMA] We're rich!

20
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:03,708
[BLUE] I'm afraid that
you're both mistaken!

21
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:05,958
That treasure belongs
to the Red Ribbon Army!

22
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:07,375
[KRILLIN]
Uh oh...

23
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:09,708
[NARRATOR] General Blue
challenged Krillin for control

24
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:13,666
of the prize. But thanks to his
training with Master Roshi,

25
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:16,416
Krillin was somewhat
less than intimidated.

26
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,541
It didn't take long
for Blue to realize

27
00:03:18,625 --> 00:03:20,416
that he would need
more than tough talk

28
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,250
to get the young
fighter to back down!

[NARRATOR] Paralyzed by
General Blue's psychic powers,

40
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:01,791
Krillin was unable
to defend himself.

[NARRATOR] It looked like
the end for Krillin.

53
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:42,833
But at the last possible moment,
Goku burst onto the scene

54
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:46,791
to give General Blue
a new challenger to face!

55
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:49,291

Krillin! Are you okay?

Hey! Stop picking on

00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:35,958
you big bully!

60

[BLUE laughs]
Don't you fret.

61
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:41,958
You won't get left out,
little boy, I promise you that.

62
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:43,541
[BLUE] There's plenty
of room on the floor,

63
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:46,791
next to your egghead chum!

64
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:49,583
Stop talking and fight already!

65
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:52,875
[BLUE laughs] You're in that
much of a hurry to die?

66
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:54,416
[GOKU]
I'm not afraid of you!

67
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,916
[BLUE]
Really?

68
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,791
Well, tell me...

69
00:05:57,875 --> 00:06:00,458
Are you afraid of this?

[BLUE grunting]

71
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:13,333
Yes, I can see your bottom lip
quivering with fear, little one.

72
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:17,708
No matter. The end is here.

73
00:06:17,791 --> 00:06:21,458
Oh yeah? You look
like a big balloon.

You insubordinate twerp!

75

there on the ceiling?

[BULMA]
Goku! Goku, I'm so sorry!

85
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:53,166
I was trying to
divert his attention

86
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:55,375
so you could whack him!

87

That was amazing!

109

Goku seems even
stronger than he was

during the

You are a thorn in my side...

Get up! Wha--?

Now, I'm only gonna say
this once, so pay attention.

You tell me where
the Dragon Ball is

Extraordinary...

00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:39,000
That is the last place I
would have thought to look.

[GOKU whimpers]

168
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:43,208
The Red Ribbon Army
thanks you for your cooperation.

169
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:45,958
Say goodbye to your friend.
He must be going.

170
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:47,500
No! You can't hurt him!

171
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,708
I-I told you where
the Dragon Ball is!

172
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:51,125
Let him go!

173
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:53,083
You promised!

174
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:54,125
I did?

175
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:57,333
Well, I guess I lied.

176
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:59,875
Well. Bye, bye!

177

[BULMA screams]

178
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:04,208
How can he survive
a gunshot?! He can't!

179
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:06,666
He may be strong but
he's only human...!

180
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:10,083
He'll shoot me next. I know it!
How did I get into this mess?!

181
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:14,625
It's not fair! Just look at me!
I'm too beautiful to die!

182
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:16,375
Nice to see you care.

Hey, I can move again!

189

That's great! Goku, quick!
Now's your chance!

190
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:45,166
Get him while he's distracted.

191
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:47,791
Kick him once
in the head for me!

192
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:50,208
Why are you scared?
It's just a mouse!

193
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:52,000
That wasn't a mouse!

194
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:53,708
Did you see the
size of its tail?!

195
00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:55,666
I hate rodents!

196
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,166
That mouse saved me.

197
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:58,791
Stop crying and fight fair!

[GOKU] It's a good thing
you know how to climb.

219
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,750
[KRILLIN] We thought you
were a goner for sure!

220
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:29,666
I would have been if I would've
waited for you two to help!

221
00:15:32,041 --> 00:15:33,291
[KRILLIN]
Check it out guys!

222
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,875
I can't believe we did it!
We found the treasure!

223
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:36,791
It's all ours!

224
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:38,000

What good's a treasure

225
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:40,000
if we're not around
to enjoy it?! Let's go!

[GOKU]
What about the Dragon Ball?!

227
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:43,500
Like I said before, it's at
the bottom of the pool.

228
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:45,916
But there's no time
to get it now! Come on!

229
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,125
Goku! Come on!

230
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:49,208
You guys go ahead.
I'll catch up.

231
00:15:49,291 --> 00:15:50,875
I have to go after
the Dragon Ball.

232
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:53,208
It might be my grandpa's.

No! Goku, wait!

There's nothing we can do!

[BULMA] We shouldn't
be far from the sub!

239
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:03,208
[KRILLIN] Let's hope the
submarine is still there!

240

we've got a long way to swim!

be a permanent resident here!

Are you okay?!

250
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,500
[KRILLIN] Yeah, I think so.
What about the submarine?

251
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:58,416
I don't know.
I think it's still intact!

252
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,166
[KRILLIN] Great! How are we
supposed to get to it, huh?

253

We'll be crushed by rubble!

We can do it!

If we stay here,
we're goners for sure!

So buck up and follow my lead!

[BULMA] Quick, untie us.
I'll get the engine started!

258
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:16,708
What about Goku?
He's been gone a long time!

259
00:19:18,041 --> 00:19:20,041
Not here.

Boy, I've been looking
everywhere for you!

266
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:44,916
We'd better get
out of this place!

267
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,416
Come on, you can ride with me,

It's magnificent!

Enough riches to forge a
kingdom! And it's all mine!

[BULMA]
This is insane!

00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:29,083
Why'd he have to go
after that stupid ball?!

285
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:31,416
It's not gonna do
him any good dead!

286
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,791
Oh! Stop talking like he's
not going to make it out!

287
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:34,708
He'll be fine!

288
00:21:34,791 --> 00:21:36,333
And how do you
know that, huh?

289
00:21:36,416 --> 00:21:37,833
We barely made it out alive

290
00:21:37,916 --> 00:21:39,833
and we were running
as fast as we could.

291
00:21:39,916 --> 00:21:42,125
Goku wasn't going to leave
without that Dragon Ball.

[KRILLIN growls]
Fine...

So what if it were you in there?

294
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,708
I'd expect you to make
the same decision

295

I'm having to make right now!

296

[KRILLIN whimpers]

297
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,666
We're leaving. Now.

298
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:00,000
I wish there was another
option, but there's not.

299
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:02,833
If Goku were here,
he'd say the same thing.

[NARRATOR] Can Goku escape
the crumbling fortress in time?

302

Will Bulma and Krillin really
leave their friend behind?
