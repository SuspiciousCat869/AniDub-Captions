00:02:16,375 --> 00:02:18,875
[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball.

2
00:02:18,958 --> 00:02:21,375
After Bulma
repaired Goku's radar,

3
00:02:21,458 --> 00:02:25,041
the two raced off in search
of the third Dragon Ball.

4
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:28,666
They found it...
at the bottom of the ocean.

5
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,791
Determined to retrieve
what he hoped would be

6
00:02:30,875 --> 00:02:33,333
his grandpa's four-star Ball,

7
00:02:33,416 --> 00:02:36,000
Goku dived into
the mysterious unknown

8
00:02:36,083 --> 00:02:38,041
with his lungs full of air

9
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:41,250
and his heart
filled with bravery.

10
00:02:41,333 --> 00:02:44,458
Unfortunately, not even Goku
could hold his breath

11
00:02:44,541 --> 00:02:46,958
long enough
to reach the ocean floor,

12
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:49,833
although he gave it
his best shot.

13
00:02:49,916 --> 00:02:56,708
[groans lightly]

14
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:03,041
[NARRATOR] In the end,
Goku had to turn back.

15
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:04,708
But he wasn't discouraged.

16
00:03:04,791 --> 00:03:07,291
He and Bulma
simply switched to plan B

17
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:10,083
and headed to Roshi's island,
in hopes that the old Master

18
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:13,041
would allow the explorers
to borrow his submarine.

19
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:15,333
I wish we didn't
have to involve Roshi.

20
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:17,583
There's no telling
what he'll ask in exchange.

21
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:20,291
But I bet he asks me.

22
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:22,500
Faster, Nimbus!

23
00:03:23,791 --> 00:03:26,250
[BULMA screams]

24
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:28,833
Hey, flyboy! Slow down!

25
00:03:28,916 --> 00:03:30,625
[stammers]

26
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:34,333
[BULMA] Hello! Goku!
Small girl hanging by your hair!

27
00:03:34,416 --> 00:03:36,041
Sorry.

28
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:37,916
[chuckles nervously]

29
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:40,416
[GOKU] I think we're
almost there.

30
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:45,833
[laughs] I see it!

31
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:47,708
[GOKU] I see it! We're here!

32
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:49,166
[sighs]

33
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:34,875
[beeping]

34
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:36,875
[PILOT] This is Scout Zero
One to Command Center.

35
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:39,583
We have a situation.
Repeat, we have a situation.

36
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:42,375
We've located two downed
scout planes on a small island,

37
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:44,583
southwest of Base Seven.

38
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:46,166
[PILOT] Both pilots are wounded.

39
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:48,083
They were attacked by the boy.

40
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:50,041
There is one other thing, sir.

41
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:51,458
[BLUE groans]

42
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:54,041
[PILOT] The pilots claim
the boy wasn't traveling alone.

43
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:57,125
Apparently, he was
accompanied by a young woman.

44
00:04:57,208 --> 00:04:58,666
This is General Blue.

45
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:01,083
What exactly
did the female look like?

46
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:02,708
[PILOT] That's all the
information we were able to get

47
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:04,208
before the pilots passed out.

48
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:06,083
[BLUE] I am talking
to a dead man right now

49
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:08,625
if I don't get a full report
on my desk in two hours.

50
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:10,375
Do you understand me?!

51
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:19,250
This boy has laid waste
to two of our best regiments

52
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:20,666
and I will not be the third.

53
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:23,000
He may possess some skill,
but there is one thing

54
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:25,958
that I know for certain,
and that is...

55
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:28,666
[BLUE] nothing lasts forever.

56
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:31,125
[laughs intensely]

57
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:44,916
[TURTLE grunts lightly]

58
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,375
Hm?

59
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:52,750
Hey! Hu-huh!

60
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:00,375
[laughs]

61
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:03,333
Oh, Goku!
This is certainly a surprise!

62
00:06:03,416 --> 00:06:06,333
Welcome back.
It's good to see you again!

63
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:08,166
It's good to
see you, too, Turtle.

64
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:11,166
I sure have missed everybody.
It's been way too long.

65
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:14,625
Yeah. So, are you here
on business or pleasure?

66
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,333
I need Master Roshi's help.

67
00:06:16,416 --> 00:06:18,166
Oh. Hang on, I'll get him...

68
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:21,083
Hey, Master! Master!

69
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:22,666
[TURTLE] Goku's here!

[music plays from TV]

[ROSHI groans lightly]

00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:50,250
[laughing]

73
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:53,541
Aaah...! [continues laughing]

74
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:54,958
[TURTLE] Hey, Master!

75
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:57,750
I'm busty. I mean busy!

76
00:06:57,833 --> 00:06:59,125
[ROSHI] Ah! Confound it!

77
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:02,041
Can't a fella get a
moment's peace around here?!

78
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,041
[TURTLE]
Goku's here to see you!

79
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:08,625
Mm?

80
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:15,208
Goku's here?

81
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:17,250
[GOKU laughs]

82
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:19,416
Oh! What brings
you out here, boy?

83
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,291
I thought you were off
looking for your Dragon Ball?

84
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:25,250
I still am!
And it's been loads of fun!

85
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:27,375
Uh, what can I help you with?

86
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:30,125
We need help... breathing...

87
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:32,250
I'd better let Bulma tell you.

88
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:33,708
[ROSHI] Bulma?

89
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:38,500
Eeeeh!

90
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:46,041
Eeeh!

91
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:47,375
Uuh!

92
00:07:47,458 --> 00:07:49,041
[BULMA] Hello, Roshi.

93
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:52,291
Well I'll be a--how in
the world did you do that?!

94
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:54,208
See...? It's a
height-changing device

95
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:56,208
that can make someone
big or small.

96
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:59,375
Wha-ho!
Say now, that's something!

97
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:01,041
I know. Isn't it great?!

98
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:03,125
I programmed
the circuit relay to--

99
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:05,791
Bulma...
What about the thingy?

100
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:07,791
Oh yeah, that's right.

101
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:11,416
Say, Master Roshi,
Goku and I were curious as to

102
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,750
whether you might have
a submarine laying around here

103
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:15,666
that we could maybe borrow?

104
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:16,916
Why certainly.

105
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,166
What interest do you have
in a submarine?

106
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,791
We found another Dragon Ball
at the bottom of the ocean,

107
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:25,958
but it's way too deep
to swim to. I tried.

108
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:29,375
Is that right?
Okay, I'll lend it to you.

109
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:31,291
Thank you.

110
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:34,125
[BULMA] That was
just a little too easy.

111
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:36,375
However...

112
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:38,916
Nnnngh!

113
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,833
I'll need
that device in exchange.

114
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:43,791
My... microband?!

115
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:45,541
[ROSHI] Mhm. Mhm.

116
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:47,333
And that's it? Nothing else?

117
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:48,666
[ROSHI] Mhmmm.

118
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:51,500
Whew! That's a relief!
I was afraid you'd gotten

119
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:53,000
the wrong impression
during that incident

120
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:54,666
on Ox-King's mountain...

121
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,041
That really wasn't me...

122
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:58,000
[BULMA] I'm not the sort of
girl you're looking for.

123
00:08:58,083 --> 00:09:00,208
Not that you're looking,
of course, at me.

124
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:01,958
--[GOKU] Hm?
--[BULMA chuckles nervously]

125
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,416
I'm going to
miss the micro-band,

126
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,625
but I know it's
for a good cause. Here.

127
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,750
Oh, yes!
Thank you, thank you!

128
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:14,750
Fine. Now hand over
the capsule for the submarine.

129
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:16,875
Patience,
my dear girl, patience.

130
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:18,958
Launch and Krillin
took it into town this morning

131
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:20,250
to do some shopping.

132
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:23,083
They should be back
any minute now. No biggie.

133
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:49,291
Let's see. I think
I'll take three onions,

134
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:52,541
two carrots,
and about three cucumbers.

135
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:55,000
Sure... Sure... No problem.

136
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,500
She's cute. Is she your sister?

137
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:01,333
[laughs]

138
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:03,125
[KRILLIN] No, no, no, no.

139
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:04,708
Hm...

140
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:16,958
[beeping]

141
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:19,166
[grunts]

142
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:22,166
[STAFF OFFICER] My guess is that
the boy is working with someone.

143
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:25,166
I don't pay you
to guess, now do I?

144
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:29,375
Your second-rate speculation
won't get me the Dragon Balls.

145
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:30,833
Mhmmm.

146
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:33,583
Tell me what we know!

147
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:34,958
[STAFF OFFICER] He knows
where the Dragon Ball is

148
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:37,166
and yet he's spending
a lot of time away from it.

149
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:38,708
Probably gathering supplies.

150
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:40,541
His radar is
quite sophisticated.

151
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:43,333
Not exactly something
you'd find in a boy's toy box.

152
00:10:43,416 --> 00:10:46,500
He must be getting
assistance from someone.

153
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:49,166
[RED] That could mean
his headquarters is located

154
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:51,291
somewhere in that vicinity.

155
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:52,458
Yes, sir.

156
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:54,666
Well, don't just
stand there like a moron!

157
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:57,333
Contact General Blue
and have his scouts

158
00:10:57,416 --> 00:10:59,166
find the kid's hideout.

159
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:07,416
I understand... Yes... Yes...

160
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,083
Right. I'll get
my men on it immediately.

161
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:21,375
[waves crashing]

162
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:23,125
Where are they?

163
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:25,375
Eh-heh. They'll be
back soon. Don't worry.

00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:28,166
Turtle, what's taking
them so long?

00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:31,291
I've got a bad feeling.

Can I get you something?

192
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:13,916
A-Another glass
of water perhaps?

193
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:17,750
No thanks.
I've had so many already

that I'm begining
to feel waterlogged.

195
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:22,083
That's a shame.

[ROSHI] It's about time!
Now go to the ladies' room

00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:27,083
so I can use this micro-doo-dad!

[ROSHI] Boy, am I tired.

00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:19,041
I think I'll go
lay down for a bit.

Calm down, Roshi, old boy!

You're going to
blow your shell. Heh.

[ROSHI] Hello.

00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:58,458
Master, what happened to you?

250
00:16:58,541 --> 00:16:59,666
Never mind!

251
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:02,041
But I thought
you went in to lie down.

252
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:05,666
How could you get all wet
if you were inside the house?

253
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:08,958
It's none of your business.
Be quiet, Turtle!

254
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,416
Hey everybody... Look, up there!

255
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,958
[BULMA] Huh?

256
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,750
It's about time they got back.

257
00:17:18,833 --> 00:17:20,958
I could have been
faster than that.

258
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:29,833
They better have
a lot of groceries.

We've been waiting for you.
Why are you so late?

270
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:02,375
Uh, well...
Launch had one of her episodes

271
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:04,791
while we were
at the market today.

272
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,875
Thought so.

00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:16,000
Sounds like you two
had a big day!

277
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:18,916
Hey, Goku,
why are you here anyway?

278
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:23,750
This is Command Center
calling Scout 45.

279
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:27,208
[BLUE] Come in. What is
your P.L.C. status? Over.

280
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:30,000
This is Scout Zero One.

281
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:31,958
No sign of any base
in this sector.

282
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:33,958
However, there aren't too many
islands in this region,

283
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:36,625
so I anticipate Positive
Location Confirmation

284
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:38,166
to be imminent.

285
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,541
[BLUE] Roger that.

286
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:41,000
[PILOT] Over.

287
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:45,708
Uh-huh. Judging by this map,

288
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:48,166
you're definitely
going to need a submarine.

289

[humming]

290

[ROSHI clears throat]

291
00:18:58,208 --> 00:18:59,541
You've been working
pretty hard, Launch.

292
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:02,083
Maybe you should
take a nice hot shower.

293
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:04,541
Hm! Sounds nice,
but I have to make dinner.

294
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:06,458
I'll take one later.

295
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:08,791
Okay. Darn it!

296
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:11,375
[KRILLIN] And I think... Yes,
if it really is around here,

297
00:19:11,458 --> 00:19:13,125
you should be able to
find the pirate's treasure

298
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:15,375
easily with the submarine.

299
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:16,833
Pirate's?

300
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:19,000
Treasure?!
Did you say treasure?!

301
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:20,625
[ROSHI] Eh, say, Bulma,
wouldn't you like

302
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:22,916
a nice glass of iced tea?

303
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,833
I'm not thirsty, thanks.

304
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:28,083
So go on. Give us
the scoop on this treasure.

305
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:30,166
Master Roshi
knows more than I do.

306
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:31,333
What's that?

307
00:19:31,416 --> 00:19:33,625
You know, the story
you always tell me.

308
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:36,250
The legend of
the missing pirate's treasure.

309
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:37,833
[ROSHI] Hm?

310
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:40,500
Oh yeah.
The pirate's treasure.

311
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:42,916
Long ago, these waters
were infested with

312
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,750
pirates who pillaged and
plundered everything in sight.

313
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:47,958
Not the sort you'd
invite over for fruit punch,

314
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:49,458
I'll tell you that...

315
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:51,833
[PIRATES yelling]

316
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:55,083
[ROSHI] Pirate ships were
heavily populated and armed.

317
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:58,625
Many royal vessels, carrying
precious jewels and riches,

318
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:00,875
fell prey to their attacks.

319
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:07,958
[ROSHI] Legend has it,
much of the stolen bounty

320
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:12,166
ended up on the ocean floor,
and is still there today.

321
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:17,500
[ROSHI] Yes, sir.
Whomever finds that treasure

322
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:21,041
is going to be
as rich as a king.

323
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:25,500
Mmm... How romantic.
We have to find this treasure.

324
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:27,458
I mean, we just have to.

325
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:29,333
Yeah, it sounds awesome,
doesn't it?

326
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:31,291
I'd love to
go with you and help.

327
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:34,791
Really? We could
sure use another person.

328
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:36,458
Can I go, Master? Please!

329
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:38,708
I know this map
like the back of my hand!

330
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:42,125
Mhm. I suppose...
But finish your chores first.

331
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:43,916
Yes sir!

332
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:54,500
[GOKU] Thanks, Master Roshi!
See you later!

333
00:20:56,416 --> 00:20:58,375
--[ROSHI] Good luck, kiddos!
--[TURTLE] Bye! Take care!

334
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:10,000
There's something
I don't understand.

335
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:11,541
If we want
to go under the water,

336
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:13,958
then how come
we're in an airplane?

337
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:15,375
This baby does both.

338
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:17,333
It's a submarine
and an airplane.

339
00:21:17,416 --> 00:21:19,791
Wow! An air fish!

340
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:21,375
The proper name is actually--

341
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:23,708
Oh no, I left
my rucksack at Roshi's

342
00:21:23,791 --> 00:21:25,541
with the Dragon Balls inside!

343
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:26,791
It's okay. Relax.

344
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:28,000
Nothing's going to happen to it

345
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:30,333
while it's at
Master Roshi's house.

346
00:21:30,416 --> 00:21:33,750
You're right. I'm just
being silly. What a relief!

347
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:36,583
[PILOT] Huh?

348
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:38,166
Priority message
for General Blue,

349
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:39,500
this is Scout Zero One.

350
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:41,458
I've spotted an
unidentified flying object

351
00:21:41,541 --> 00:21:42,833
heading North, Northwest.

352
00:21:42,916 --> 00:21:45,125
Would you like me
to follow in pursuit? Over.

353
00:21:45,208 --> 00:21:47,291
[BLUE] Negative.
Backtrack its flight pattern.

354
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:50,083
If it is the boy, his base
can't be too far away. Over.

355
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:51,541
Copy that.

356
00:21:57,666 --> 00:21:58,666
I've got something!

357
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,416
There's a house
on a small island.

358
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:04,958
Grid marking ESA Seven, zero,
two, four, niner, point. Over.

359
00:22:05,041 --> 00:22:07,291
Go to visual tracking,
infrared scan.

360
00:22:07,375 --> 00:22:09,041
Is anybody out there? Over.

361
00:22:09,125 --> 00:22:11,291
[PILOT] Affirmative...
I have visual confirmation.

362
00:22:11,375 --> 00:22:14,583
Repeat, I have visual
confirmation of an old man,

363
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,166
one woman, and a turtle.

364
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:18,791
All are outside the house
and appear to be unarmed.

365
00:22:18,875 --> 00:22:20,916
Awaiting further
instructions. Over.

366
00:22:24,375 --> 00:22:26,458
Ooh...
It sure is hot out here.

367
00:22:26,541 --> 00:22:28,250
Maybe you should
take that shower now.

368
00:22:28,333 --> 00:22:29,958
Huh?

369
00:22:30,041 --> 00:22:31,875
[TURTLE] Oh brother.

370
00:22:33,625 --> 00:22:35,166
The old man
must be the scientist

371
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:37,416
who designed the kid's radar.

372
00:22:39,041 --> 00:22:43,375
[ROSHI laughs]

373
00:22:43,458 --> 00:22:45,000
[NARRATOR]
Now that the Red Ribbon Army

374
00:22:45,083 --> 00:22:46,875
knows about Roshi's island,

375
00:22:46,958 --> 00:22:49,666
what will become
of Goku and his friends?

376
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:54,583
Find out next time, on another
exciting episode of Dragon Ball!
