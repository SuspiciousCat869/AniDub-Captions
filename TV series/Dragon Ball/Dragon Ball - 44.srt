00:02:13,208 --> 00:02:15,291
[NARRATOR] On the last
episode of Dragon Ball,

2
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:18,083
Goku traveled to West City
to have Bulma repair

3
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:19,708
the broken Dragon Radar.

4
00:02:19,791 --> 00:02:21,666
On his first trip
to the big city,

5
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:26,125
Goku found he had a lot
to learn about urban life.

6
00:02:26,208 --> 00:02:29,166
But after a quick challenge
fight on the street corner,

7
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,833
Goku amazed the crowd
and earned some cash

8
00:02:31,916 --> 00:02:34,250
to make his search
a little easier.

9
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:37,458
Or so he thought, until he
encountered a pair of thugs

10
00:02:37,541 --> 00:02:39,708
looking to take advantage
of his innocent nature.

11
00:02:39,791 --> 00:02:41,125
They found out soon enough,

12
00:02:41,208 --> 00:02:43,625
that our young hero is
much more than he appears...

13
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:46,166
Finally, Goku was
steered in the direction

14
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,958
of a kindly police officer,
who, after a little prodding,

15
00:02:49,041 --> 00:02:51,291
guided him safely across
town to Bulma's home

16
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:52,791
at the Capsule Corporation.

17
00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:56,583
Stay tuned; Goku's urban
adventure continues today!

18
00:03:05,791 --> 00:03:08,666
Bull-maaa!

19
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:13,041
It's me, Goku! I'm down here!

20
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:13,833
Bul-ma!

21
00:03:13,916 --> 00:03:16,416
Oh-ho! Stope that there!

22
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,708
You really don't have to
yell like that, you know?

23
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:21,166
You can step up
and use the intercom.

24
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,166
What's an intercom?

25
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:25,875
Uh... Good day.

26
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:27,708
Uh... We're here to
speak to Miss Bulma

27
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:31,000
if she's available,
please, there.

28
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:32,791
[ROBOT MAID]
Bulma is not on the premises.

29
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:36,375
She has not yet returned
from her school day.

30
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:39,541
Whoa... How can that pole talk?

31
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:42,625
Oh... that's right,
it's not quite time

32
00:03:42,708 --> 00:03:44,541
for school to let out yet.

33
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:46,458
What should-- Hey!

34
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:48,208
Get away from there!

35
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:50,416
What now?

36
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,833
Should we wait here?

37
00:03:51,916 --> 00:03:54,875
Yeah, I'll wait, but you
can go ahead and leave.

38
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:58,416
Oh nooo! How do I know for
sure that you're her friend?

39
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,125
I'd be in big trouble with the
boss there if I led a crook

40
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:02,958
to the home of Dr. Brief!

41
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:04,625
I'm not a bad guy!

42
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:06,750
You don't have to
worry about me!

43
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:08,791
[POLICEMAN] Well,
anyway, Capsule Corporation

44

is one of the most important
companies in the world.

45
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:13,125
The Briefs are very influential.

46
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:15,541
It's hard to believe a strange
little fellow like you

47
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:18,583
would know them. One can
never be too careful, you know.

48
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:20,666
Hey, I'm picking up

[GOKU] Huuuh.

[GOKU] Hi!

[loud music plays]

62
00:04:58,583 --> 00:05:00,791
How in the world did
you find this place?

63
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:02,416
Well, I almost didn't...

64
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,208
But Mr. Police here
gave me a ride!

65
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:09,583
Right. So are you actually,
uh, related to the Dr. Brief?

66
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:11,625
Oh yeah. He's my dad.

67
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:13,541
So, what brings you
here to see me?

68
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:15,083
I came to ask for help.

69
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:17,250
I'm pretty sure I broke
the Dragon Radar.

70
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:18,916
Do you think you
could fix it for me?

71
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,583
[BULMA] Well, sure, no problem.

72
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:22,000
Let's go take a look at it.

[POLICEMAN] I don't get it.
I didn't smell a thing.

75
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:28,708
How'd he know she
was coming, there?

76

Wait! Miss, excuse me!

77
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:33,625
I hate to ask, but do you
think you could check out

78
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:34,833
my bike while you're at it?

79
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:36,958
It hasn't been
running very well there.

80
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:39,625
[BULMA] Yeah, whatever. Okay.

81
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:41,750
[POLICEMAN] Hey, is it
a school holiday today?

82
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:43,250
Did they let you out early?

83
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:46,208
[BULMA] I got bored,
so I skipped out.

pretend I didn't hear that.

00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,666
I guess next time you'll
fix the radar yourself!

163
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:01,291
[GOKU] But you can't even
ride on the Flying Nimbus!

164

[BULMA laughs]

165
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:05,625
Yes! Yes I can!

166
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:09,625
So you're saying you're
completely good now?

167
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:12,208
I am an exceptionally
good person!

168
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:14,375
My only crime is
being beautiful.

169
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:15,833
Uhh...

170
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:19,500
Watch!

171
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:21,125
This is my newest thing.

172
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:22,583
What's it do?

173
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:25,083
It's my own invention,
the Microband.

174
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:26,333
When I push this button,

175
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:28,875
I shrink to a fraction
of my normal size!

176
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:35,791
[GOKU] Whoaa!

177
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:40,000
That is really neat!

178
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:43,250
You're not even
as tall as my knee!

179
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,250
[BULMA] Sometimes
I even amaze myself!

180
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:47,000
And as long as
I'm shrunk like this,

181
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:50,208
you'll be able to carry me with
you on the Nimbus no sweat!

182
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:53,125
Yeah, I bet that'll
work just fine!

183
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:55,916
Come on, Goku, please?
Let's try it just once!

184
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,416
I'll take you on a
guided tour of the city!

you must be little Goku!

188
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:04,333
Hi there!

189
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:08,208
How do you do?

190
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:10,416
I'm Bulma's mother, Mrs. Brief.

Bulma, darling,
you scared me!

00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:23,458
What are you doing
underneath my foot?!

198
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:25,750
Mom, you stepped on me!

199
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:28,458
I don't understand why you
want to shrink yourself anyway.

200
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:31,791
Watch your step when
you come in my room!

201
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:35,333
I'm sorry for all the noise,
but she's at that age.

202
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:39,166
Well, anyway, would you
like some refreshments?

203
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:42,000
Mother, would you
just leave us alone?!

204
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:45,333
Oh! You're in...
such a mood!

[BULMA screams]

206
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:51,041
Hey, where are
Oolong and Yamcha?

207
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:52,250
Ugh...

208
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:55,541
Do both of them still
live here with you?

209
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:57,583
Well, yes, Yamcha
and Oolong should be

210
00:10:57,666 --> 00:10:58,833
around here somewhere,

211
00:10:58,916 --> 00:11:00,791
but Yamcha and Bulma
are having a little--

212
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:02,333

[STAFF OFFICER]
If the reports are true, sir,

218
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,708
it would seem that
this boy defeated

219
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:20,916
all of Tower
guards by himself.

220
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,916
General White's forces have
been completely destroyed.

221
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,958
In addition, it seems he
now has two Dragon Balls

222
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:28,000
in his possession...

223
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:30,500
One from White,
and one from Silver.

224
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:32,166
[RED] Do we know where he is?

225
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:33,333
[STAFF OFFICER] Yes, sir.

226
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:36,625
We believe we have
pinpointed his location.

227
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:40,458
According to our Dragon Radar,
his current position is here.

228
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:43,458
Which puts him somewhere
within the limits of West City.

229
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:45,208
[RED] West City?

230
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:46,333
[STAFF OFFICER] Mm-hmm.

231
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:47,666
[RED chuckles]

232
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:50,000
So he's right there in our
master thief's hometown.

233
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:51,166
How unfortunate.

234
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,916
--[RED chuckles]
--[STAFF OFFICER] For him.

235
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,250
I've given Hasky 1 million
zeni as payment to secure

236
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:58,416
the Dragon Balls and
return them to us.

237
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,916
[RED chuckles]

238
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,041
Excellent.

239
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:05,750
[STAFF OFFICER] Yes, and if past
performance is any indication,

240
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:09,333
I have no doubt it is
money well spent.

241
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:17,875
[STAFF OFFICER] Hasky has made
a career out of successfully

242
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:20,750
pulling jobs most
would call impossible.

243
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:23,625
"Impenetrable Security"
is merely a phrase

244
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:25,166
to be proven wrong...

245
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:28,916
In my opinion, the title
"Master Thief" barely begins

246
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,416
to describe this
level of talent.

00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:37,166

Last time, if you'll recall,

we received our merchandise
ahead of schedule,

249

and the authorities were left
without a trace to follow.

I believe I can say
with confidence,

Hasky will find the boy...
and the Dragon Balls.

that's my cue!

Ho-ho! Ho ho ho ho!

00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:44,250
So, ready to go?

Let's do it!

Rich people. They really
are a different breed.

You're a cop, you should pay
attention to your driving!

[POLICEMAN] I'm so sorry!
It just got away from me!

00:18:27,916 --> 00:18:28,958
How cool!

335
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,583
I love it up here!

Look! Over there!

00:18:33,541 --> 00:18:35,875
[BULMA] That's the biggest
shopping mall in the city!

00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:37,333
[GOKU] Let's go then!

[GOKU gasps]

[GOKU] What is that?

347
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:08,416
[BULMA] It's an amusement
park! It just opened.

348
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:12,583
I've never been there.
Hey, why don't we go?

Yeah?

00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:15,208
It looks like so much fun!

Huh?

the whole day up there!

What brings you here?

So, did you come
to see Bulma?

Nothing.

00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:02,833
You, uh, hear about
Bulma and Yamcha?

378
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:05,375
She's got this kid
sleeping in the dog-house,

379
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:06,583
if you know what I mean.

380
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:08,791
I guess. I mean I...

381
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:11,791
I sure got the feeling
Bulma didn't want to see him.

00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:14,291
Did... she... say that?

Are you okay?

So, its...

389
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:27,416
just like I thought.

like me anymore...

break your heart.

that girl gives you,

off without her.

I think she's a spoiled brat!

[OOLONG &amp; PUAR] Huh?!

420
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:37,125
[BULMA] Ooooh!
It is so incredibly rude

421
00:21:37,208 --> 00:21:40,083
to talk badly about
a girl behind her back!

422

I'm sorry! Wait, Bulma!

423

Well, well, I'm suddenly in the
mood to ride a roller coaster.

I have been meaning to go
and check this place out.

[GOKU] Hmmm?

428
00:22:10,291 --> 00:22:11,666
What's up, Goku?

429
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:17,125
[GOKU] Uhhh...
Oh, it's nothing.

[HASKY]
So, "Goku", is it?

431
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,208
Pleasure to make
your acquaintance,

even if it is only for
the last day of your life...

[HASKY] They tell me
you're pretty powerful, kid.

But you're still
just a child!

Those Dragon Balls
are as good as mine!

436

at the amusement park.

439
00:22:44,625 --> 00:22:47,208
But with a dangerous criminal
like Hasky on their trail,

440
00:22:47,291 --> 00:22:50,458
the price of admission
includes a ticket to danger

441
00:22:50,541 --> 00:22:52,958
on the next Dragon Ball!
