00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,583
[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball...

2
00:02:16,666 --> 00:02:18,791
After discovering
the Bansho fan,

3
00:02:18,875 --> 00:02:21,750
Goku and ChiChi returned
to the Ox King's castle

4
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:24,541
to battle the mysterious fire
which had threatened

5
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:26,875
to consume the entire kingdom.

6
00:02:33,166 --> 00:02:35,625
Using the power
of the Bansho fan,

7
00:02:35,708 --> 00:02:37,916
Goku created a massive wind,

8
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,416
strong enough to
blow out any flame.

9
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,416
ChiChi and the villagers
watched in awe

10
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,708
as Goku's efforts seemed
to extinguish the blaze.

11
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:48,208
However, the end
was far from over,

12
00:02:48,291 --> 00:02:51,833
as the fire continued to
rage with increased fury.

13
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:57,083
The plan had failed.

14
00:02:57,166 --> 00:02:58,791
Hope gave way to fear

15
00:02:58,875 --> 00:03:01,375
as the villagers watched
their town burn.

16
00:03:01,458 --> 00:03:04,666
And ChiChi's desperate attempt
to save her father

17
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,625
seemed in vain.

18
00:03:06,708 --> 00:03:08,625
[CHICHI]
Papa!

19
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,333
You... are... going... out!

[BABA]
Goku, stop! Don't use the fan!

24
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,375
Wait a minute!

25

[screams]

26
00:03:58,208 --> 00:03:58,625
Huh?

00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:02,375
Uh?

28
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:03,750
Baba, what's wrong?

29
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:06,750
[BABA] The Bansho fan has no
effect on these flames

30
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:10,583
because this fire was forged
in the magical furnace.

31
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:11,791
Magical what?

32
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:14,083
All you're doing
by waving that fan

33
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:16,125
is making the flames stronger.

34
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:18,333
What should I do? Watch?

35
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:29,750
[BABA mumbling]
Hmm... hmm.

36
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:40,833
[BABA]
Behold, the magical furnace.

37
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:44,708
It's shaped like an octagon.
The clue was about the furnace!

38
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:46,791
[BABA]
Yes. In fact, the Bansho fan

39
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:50,416
was originally used
to create fire for the furnace.

40
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,500
But there has to be some
way we can put it out!

41
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:56,791
There's always a way, but the
peril is beyond imagination.

42
00:04:56,875 --> 00:05:01,541
You must journey to Mt. Five
Elements and find Tajoro.

43
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:05,541
Tajoro... Is that
some kind of monster?

44
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:08,750
He's many things, including
the keeper of the furnace.

45
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:11,500
[GOKU sighs]
Well, if this Tajoro can help us

46
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:13,541
save the Ox King,
it's worth the risk.

47
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:15,250
Tell me how to get there.

48
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:18,958
Watch the crystal ball.

49
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:22,166
This is the entrance,
the Gate of the Five Elements,

50
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:24,583
located on Frying Pan Plain.

51
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:29,583
It's on the other side
of the world.

52
00:05:29,666 --> 00:05:30,833
[BOTH]
The other side?

53
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:37,958
[BABA}
If you embark on this quest,

54
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:41,083
do so with the knowledge
that you may not return.

55
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:44,166
The path you must travel
is not an easy one.

56
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:47,583
It is fraught with
dangers both seen and not.

57
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:51,208
Mt. Five Elements is home to
more than just the furnace.

58
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:54,375
It is also the gateway
to the dark world.

59
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:56,416
[CHICHI]
The dark world?

60
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:01,416
[BABA] It is where the shadow
souls dwell, the home of evil.

61
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:05,958
Only in spirit form can the
journey be made successfully.

62
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:08,041
[GOKU] You mean we can't get
there without dying?

63
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:10,375
If you could,
you'd be the first.

64
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:12,666
It is said that the foot
of the mountain

65
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:17,125
is guarded by warrior spirits,
barbaric assassins who destroy

66
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:19,750
any living creature
that approaches the barrier.

67
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:23,125
So you see, the trick
isn't how to get in,

68
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:25,750
but how to get in alive.

69
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:28,875
[CHICHI]
Just once, couldn't it be easy?

70
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:30,750
[BABA laughs]

71
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:32,833

getting close.

Old woman, are you insane?
They'll be killed!

76
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:25,458
And by the looks of it,
they won't be the only ones.

77
00:07:25,541 --> 00:07:28,708
Anyway, it was their
decision. I warned them.

78
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:37,083
ChiChi... Goku...

79
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:47,958
It looked smaller
in the crystal.

Are you ready?

81
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:50,500

like that before.

Stay on your guard, ChiChi.

[BEAST roaring]

183
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:24,791
[GOKU] I couldn't have healed
so quickly. This isn't real.

[BEAST roars]

00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:35,291
Don't worry.

00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:37,208
[CHICHI]
Are we seeing the same creature?

187
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:39,083
This is the perfect
time to worry!

188
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:40,875
It's all an illusion!

189
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,416
Does he know?

190
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,208
[GOKU]
Please! Trust me!

00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:57,791
You're right!

192
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:03,000
Hold onto me, ChiChi.
We're going for a ride.

193
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:04,416
Okay!

Incredible!

They're the first humans

Did we make it? Where are we?

201
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:40,916
[GOKU]
It's just as I thought.

202
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,875
Everything we saw
was all in our minds.

203
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:48,333
[CHICHI] I never knew I had
such a vivid imagination.

204
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:50,166
[GOKU]
All of it, fake.

205
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,041
We were never in any danger.

206
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:56,541
But I"ll bet this
entrance is real.

There's nowhere left to run.

210
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:28,833
I guess...we found it!

211
00:18:28,916 --> 00:18:32,208
This must be the furnace.
It's gigantic!

212
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:38,250
[GOKU]
Tajoro, come out! Tajoro!

213
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:49,333
Tajoro! Hey, can you hear me?

214
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:50,708
[MAN]
Of course I can hear you.

Ah, Grandpa?

218
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:01,541
[CHICHI]
What?

219
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:06,083
Grandpa? Impossible! Goku?

220
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:10,375
Yes, it really is you!
It's me, your grandson!

221
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:14,000
But, how did you...

222
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:15,625
You've grown so big!

223
00:19:15,708 --> 00:19:17,708
You haven't changed at all!

224
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:20,875
I should hope not.
After all, I'm dead.

225
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:22,666
What are you doing
in the Dark World?

226
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,125
I thought only evil was here.

227
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:26,875
[GOHAN]
Dark World? Evil?

228
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:29,666
Those are just stories
to keep away the tourists.

229
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:33,166
This place is a bridge
to the other world.

230
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:35,416
Oh, who is your
lovely companion?

231
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,833
My fianceé.

232
00:19:36,916 --> 00:19:38,375
[GOHAN]
Fianceé?

233
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:41,041
[GOKU] Yup. This is ChiChi.
She's the Ox King's daughter.

234
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:44,333
Chi Chi, this is
my grandfather, Gohan.

235
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:46,708
Pleased to meet you.

236
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:52,541
It is an honor. This has
turned into a family reunion.

237
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:55,666
Actually, I knew you
when you were just a baby.

238
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:59,708
I was good friends with your
father. How is he doing, anyway?

239
00:19:59,791 --> 00:20:04,166
Horrible! His castle's on fire!
That's why we traveled here.

240
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:07,125
We were told the Magical
Furnace could put it out.

241
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:09,708
Huh? Goku, what are
you talking about?

242
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,708
It's okay.
Everything will be fine.

243
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:14,750
Now that you know,
you can save his kingdom.

244
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:17,833
Whoa, hold on, son.
It's not that simple.

245
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:20,916
If the furnace is involved,
this won't be easy.

246
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,708
Of course it will!
You're Tajoro.

247
00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:25,375
You can do anything you
want with the furnace.

248
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:28,750
Wait a minute.
You thought I was Tajoro?

249
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:30,791
No, I just work here part time.

250
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:32,208
[WOMAN]
Gohan?

251
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:39,500
Grandpa, who is that?

252
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:41,750
That, Grandson, is Tajoro.

253
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:44,000
She is the caretaker
of the magical furnace.

254
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:47,083
The name Tajoro is
actually an alias for Annin.

255
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:49,833
I've been assigned to guard her.

256
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:53,083
[ANNIN]
Gohan, are you there or not?

257
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:55,250
[GOHAN]
Yes, I'm right here.

258
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:59,250
My grandson stopped by
to pay me a visit.

259
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:02,041
[ANNIN] In that case,
I shall come to you.

260
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:10,958
[rumbling]

261
00:21:24,166 --> 00:21:26,208
Gohan, my noodles,
they're soggy.

262
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:27,583
I fear there
may be a malfunction

263
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:30,125
with the Magical Furnace's
temperature regulators.

264
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:32,166
Didn't you replace
them last week?

265
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:33,083
Huh?

266
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:34,625
I don't think there's anything--

267
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:36,000
[GOKU]
So, you're Tajoro!

268
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:38,125
My name is Goku, and I have
a favor to ask of you.

269
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:40,083
Please put out the Magical Fire!

270
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:40,958
[gasps]

271
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:43,041
I beg of you, please help us.

272
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:44,958
My father is trapped
within the flames.

273
00:21:45,041 --> 00:21:47,708
Unless I'm mistaken,
the Ox King's castle

274
00:21:47,791 --> 00:21:50,750
is located on the
other side of this mountain.

275
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:52,750
That would put it in
the fire's direct path.

276
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:54,666
Perhaps there's a hole
in the furnace.

277
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:58,083
Then you'll have to find a
way to turn off the furnace.

278
00:21:58,166 --> 00:22:01,041
I'm afraid I can't
do that, Goku.

279
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:03,166
[GOKU]
What do you mean? Why not?

280
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:05,458
[ANNIN] In theory, if the
magical fire were extinguished,

281
00:22:05,541 --> 00:22:08,708
the plains of existence would
be thrown into utter chaos.

282
00:22:08,791 --> 00:22:11,291
Actually, that sounds
like alot of fun.

283
00:22:11,375 --> 00:22:13,791
Utter chaos? Annin, what
are you saying?

284
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:15,416
Annin, please!

285
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,375
You must help.

286
00:22:17,458 --> 00:22:18,458
Grandpa!

287
00:22:18,541 --> 00:22:20,333
[grunting]
Mh-hm... mh-hm.

288
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:23,166
I'm sorry, but the magical
flame cannot be put out,

289
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:25,458
for you or anyone.

290
00:22:27,166 --> 00:22:29,250
Now, you wouldn't want
to be responsible

291
00:22:29,333 --> 00:22:31,666
for the world's
greatest disaster.

292
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,833
Hm?

293
00:22:33,916 --> 00:22:35,000
[slurps]

294
00:22:35,083 --> 00:22:37,041
[NARRATOR]
What is the mysterious disaster

295
00:22:37,125 --> 00:22:38,791
Annin speaks of?

296
00:22:38,875 --> 00:22:42,750
How will Goku solve
the impossible dilemma?

297
00:22:42,833 --> 00:22:48,041
Will he risk the fate of the
world to save ChiChi's father?

298
00:22:48,125 --> 00:22:50,791
Don't miss the
extraordinary conclusion

299
00:22:50,875 --> 00:22:55,458
on the final episode
of Dragon Ball.
