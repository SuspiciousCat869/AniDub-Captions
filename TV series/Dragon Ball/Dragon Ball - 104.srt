1
00:02:17,958 --> 00:02:20,625
Taking his life
was a big mistake.

2
00:02:20,708 --> 00:02:23,041
Krillin was my best friend!

3
00:02:30,875 --> 00:02:33,458
[TAMBOURINE]
I love my job.

4
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:37,291
[NARRATOR] The evil
creature known as Piccolo

5
00:02:37,375 --> 00:02:39,291
had hatched a dastardly plan.

6
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:41,625
First he sent his
henchman, Tambourine,

7
00:02:41,708 --> 00:02:43,833
to fetch the Dragon Balls.

8
00:02:43,916 --> 00:02:45,958
Then he ordered him
to destroy anyone

9
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:47,500
who would stand in his way.

10
00:02:47,583 --> 00:02:50,291
Here's the list of names.

11
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:53,250
[chuckles] Good, post them up.

12
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:56,750
You won't need his
picture any longer.

13
00:02:56,833 --> 00:02:58,166
Hahaha!

14
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:02,458
They drove back my forces
and locked me in a jar!

15
00:03:02,541 --> 00:03:04,375
Hunt them down, all of them!

16
00:03:04,458 --> 00:03:07,375
Leave not one standing.

17
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:09,250
Yes.

18
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:13,041
[NARRATOR] And so the horrible,
murderous scheme was launched.

19
00:03:55,750 --> 00:04:00,041

Huh?

00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:27,958
[TAMBOURINE chuckles]

24
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:33,166
Ahhh!

00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:42,125
Ahhh!

[TAMBOURINE chuckles]

28
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,375
This has to be my smelliest job.

29
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:15,041
Lousy bums.

Whuwazzat?

Huh? What th--

00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,583
You ok, buddy?

33
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:27,541
[BUM]
The mark of the demon!

34
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:34,375
Ahhh! Ahh! Oh! Oh!

35
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:45,000
[MAI hums]

36
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:46,625
Ah!

37
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:52,208
[MAI hums]

38
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:57,208
I uh, I brought your
melon soda, O Great One.

39
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:01,750
Ahh!!

40
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:22,875
[sighs]

41
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:25,583
[PIANO] Ahem. Back to the
matter at hand, Piccolo.

42
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:27,583
[burps]

43
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:34,041
We still have to retrieve
the rest of the Dragon Balls.

44
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:36,166
Hmmm. I have no choice.

45
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:38,500
I must make another warrior.

46
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:44,750
Yuck! He's not going to do
that weird thing again, is he?

47
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:47,708
'Fraid so. Well,
there goes my lunch.

48
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:49,958
Piccolo, you know
when you lay eggs

49
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:51,958
it speeds up your aging process.

50
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:53,458
At the rate you're going

51
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:56,250
you'll die before you'll be
able to take over the world.

52
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:59,291
[hmms]

53
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:04,083
Once I obtain all the Dragon
Balls, aging wont be a problem.

54
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:08,250
When I've made my wish,
I will be eternally young.

55
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:09,666
[PIANO]
Hmmm...

56
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:14,708
Now to create my new warrior.

57
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:19,416
His sole purpose must be
the collecting of Dragon Balls.

58
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:29,625
Rise and form to
serve your master.

59
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:32,208
Rise and form
to serve your master.

60
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:34,916
Rise and form to
serve your master.

61
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,125
Rise and form
to serve your master.

00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:41,125
Rise and form to
serve your master.

Rise and form
to serve your master.

Rise and form to
serve your master.

65
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:49,750
Rise and form
to serve your master.

[pants]

68
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:31,875
Congratulations.
So, does it have a name?

69
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:35,458
Ohhh...

70
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:39,500
His name is Cymbal.
My child of darkness.

71
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:41,000
[PIANO]
A musical instrument.

72
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:43,458
Didn't see that
one coming, Piccolo.

73
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:46,625
[PICCOLO]
Silence, Piano! Cymbal awakes!

74
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:09,375
Who do you serve, child?

75
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:12,458
[CYMBAL]
I serve my lord.

76
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:14,750
I serve Piccolo.

77
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:17,375
[PICCOLO]
And Cymbal, do you live only

78
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:20,125
to find the Dragon Balls?

79
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:22,083
Yes.

80
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:24,291
[PICCOLO] Pilaf!
Now would be a good time

81
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:26,416
to point out the
nearest Dragon Ball!

82
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,041
Uh... Uh...

83
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:31,250
Uh, there!

84
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:35,208
That would have to be
the closest one. Umm, yeah.

85
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:40,125
[PILAF] So uh, would you
like us to take Cymbal along?

86
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:41,375
Alone.

87
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:43,541
[PILAF]
Well, I'm sure you know best.

88
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,625
Now.

89
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:06,833
Pilaf, can I have
a word with you?

90
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:09,750
[SHU] Shouldn't we be the
ones giving out the orders?

91
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:11,791
After all who revived whom here?

92
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:13,833
He should be serving us!

93
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:16,291
Shh! Quiet!

94
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:18,750
He hears everything!

95
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:21,666
I'm sure that when Lord Piccolo
takes over the world,

96
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:26,250
he'll give us half of
it out of gratitude, right?

97
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:30,291
Ahhh!

98
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,791
I uh, meant a quarter?

99
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:36,833
Uh, a small city maybe?

100
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:39,041
Heh heh heh heh.

[sighs]

102
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:35,791
[GOKU] Hmm?

103
00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:44,750
Huh? Where am I?

104
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:50,041
Ow! Gosh, why does
my head hurt so much?

105
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:57,125
[stomach growls]

106
00:11:57,208 --> 00:12:03,083
Oh, no! My stomach.
Must get food.

107
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:04,750
Haha!

108
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:08,666
Oh boy!

109
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:12,208
[GOKU]
Lunch!

110
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:22,958
Uh... That fruit's gone bad.

111
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:24,500
Huh?

112
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:30,458
Hmm?

113
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,500
[GOKU hums]

114
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:38,125
Lunch!

115
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:42,083
Huh?

116
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:54,791
I don't suppose you'd be
willing to hop in my stomach?

117
00:12:56,541 --> 00:12:57,916
[GOKU]
Didn't think so.

118
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:22,166
[chuckles]

119
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:45,916
Dragon Balls. Huh.

120
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,875
And you're telling us,
if you get all seven,

121
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:50,875
any wish you make comes true?

122
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:53,708
Yep, but you only get one wish.

123
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,041
So obviously we
should use that wish

124
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:58,250
to bring Krillin back to life.

125
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:02,000
Well, I know this
is going to sound bad,

126
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:05,166
but I really think we should
use the wish to defeat Piccolo.

127
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:07,583
There's no way we
can beat him on our own.

128
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:08,958
I know we have
to bring Krillin back,

129
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:11,250
but that monster's unstoppable.

130
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:13,291
Is that a good idea, Yamcha?

131
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:15,333
I thought the Dragon Balls
turned into stone

132
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:18,166
for a whole year after
a wish has been granted.

133
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:20,791
Uh, yeah,
that sure is a long time

134
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:24,625
to let Krillin's body
hang around. Isn't it?

135
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:26,750
Ew, and what about that smell?

136
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:30,083
Well, if you ask me the idea of
bringing him back sounds creepy.

137
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:31,750
Maybe we should leave him alone.

138
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:34,791
Oh, gee pals, thanks a lot.

139
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:39,250
Well let's see, I could make a
freezer capsule to preserve him

140
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:41,708
until we find the
Dragon Balls again.

141
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:44,041
Maybe one for back-stabbers too.

142
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:46,291
Hey, I was just sayin'.

143
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,541
Hmm...

144
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:50,416
Pale, pale gray.

145
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,958
What? Who is pale grey?

146
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:57,083
Wait! Is this Pale Grey
a great warrior, Master?

147
00:14:57,166 --> 00:14:59,125
[ROSHI]
No nothing like that.

148
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:01,875
Pale gray is the color
of Bulma's panties.

149
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:03,500
Hmm?

150
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:05,250
Hmmmm?

151
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:07,416
Ah!!

152
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,583
You were staring at my
underwear this whole time?!

153
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:11,958
[ROSHI]
No! I started at your knees!

154
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:20,125
[ROSHI] More cocoa anyone?
I'm already up.

155
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:24,083
Don't you have any
sense of decency, Roshi?!

156
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:26,791
That's nice!

157
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:28,375
Kill a guy for trying
to lighten the mood.

158
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:31,416
I mean, can't you
people take a joke?

159
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,166
This is not the time for jokes.

160
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:36,958
No, I guess you're right Tien.

161
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:38,416
[NEWS] There were
three more killings

162
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,916
of world class
martial arts fighters--

163
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,333
Come here! Listen!

164
00:15:43,416 --> 00:15:46,000
[NEWS] Police are baffled as
to the motives of the killer

165
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:48,916
and why only
martial artists are targeted.

166
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,833
As to the identity
of the killer,

167
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:54,541
police are left without a clue,
save for a piece of paper found

168
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:57,916
on each of the bodies with the
word "devil" encircled on it.

169
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,041
When we return...

170
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:00,791
Can your clothing
drive you insane?

171
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:01,958
You might be surprised.

172
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:04,125
Stay tuned for
this special report.

173
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:07,500
Well, it's already begun.

174
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:09,666
Um, I hear flights to the
caribbean are cheap

175
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,541
this time of year.

176
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:13,500
Guys! All the
fighters are in danger!

177
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:15,291
We've got to warn them!

178
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:17,583
We'd have trouble contacting
them without the list.

179
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:20,333
Besides, many
of them use aliases.

180
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:23,541
We can't stay here
and do nothing.

181
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:25,208
There's got to be
some way we can help.

182
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:29,375
I'm feeling so
useless here. Come on!

183
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:31,708
Well, you are right
about not staying here.

184
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:34,375
We're sitting ducks
on this island.

185
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:35,083
Bulma!

186
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:35,958
[BULMA]
M-hmm?

187
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:37,083
How long would it take you

188
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:39,375
to construct another
Dragon Ball Radar?

189
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:40,625
[BULMA] Hmm...

190
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:43,333
Well, if I hurry,
about half a day, I guess.

191
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:47,958
Then get to it. The sooner
it's done, the better.

192
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:51,541
[ROSHI] We'll leave as
soon as you're finished.

193
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:15,750
Huh?

194
00:17:18,708 --> 00:17:20,541
Hm? Oh!

195
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:39,791
We're gonna need a lot
of those freezer capsules.

196
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:43,125
Oh, now, come on,
that's not very funny, Launch.

197
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:44,333
I'm glad you're here Tien.

198
00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:46,291
We'll need your strength.

199
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:48,291
But if Goku couldn't stop him,

200
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:51,208
I don't know that I'll be
much help, Master Roshi.

201
00:17:51,291 --> 00:17:55,625
Oh, please let our little Goku
still be alive... Poor kid.

202
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:08,458
I can't go on.
I gotta eat something.

203
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:13,208
[sniffs]

204
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:17,458
Ah ha! Something smells good!
Something smells great!

205
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:35,916
[GOKU]
It's beautiful.

206
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,166
Luuunch!

207
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:51,541
[chuckles]

208
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:53,541
Now, it's lunchtime!

209
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,333
[GOKU]
Oh, yeah!

210
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:24,250
[CYMBAL thinking]
It is near.

211
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:39,583
[GOKU sighs]

212
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,875
Mmhmm!

213
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,208
[chuckles]

214
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:13,666
I'm back to full strength!

215
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:18,583
[GOKU] And now I'm
coming for you Tambourine!

216
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:20,208
You hear me?!

217
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:22,250
You're mine!!

218
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:26,875
I promise you!

219
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:29,708
Krillin will be revenged!!

220
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:36,750
Krillin, I am so sorry
I wasn't there to stop him.

221
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:38,666
Please forgive me.

222
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:44,666
Now I remember!
He destroyed the Nimbus cloud!

223
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:53,666
Ah! Oh no, what have you done?!

224
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,125
Ah!!

225
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:03,291
I'll tear that monster apart!

226
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:08,458
Hide while you can, Tambourine!

227
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:10,000
You're going to pay
for what you've done to

228
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:12,083
Krillin and Nimbus!

229
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:16,208
You think you got away,
but you took my Dragon Ball.

230
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,541
Ha! And with
Bulma's Dragon Ball Radar

231
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:22,791
I know just where to find you!

232
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:26,333
Uh...

233
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:32,500
Huh? Is this right?

234
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,000
I can't believe it!

235
00:21:34,083 --> 00:21:36,541
Tambourine's right
around here somewhere!

236
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:39,625
Okay! Where are you? Come out!

237
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:57,583
Hmmm?

238
00:22:11,916 --> 00:22:13,250
[GOKU]
I know you're there!

239
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:15,916
Come out and face me you coward!

240
00:22:24,708 --> 00:22:26,250
I'm not a coward!

241
00:22:26,333 --> 00:22:28,458
You're the sneak
that stole my food!

242
00:22:28,541 --> 00:22:30,000
Huh?

243
00:22:30,083 --> 00:22:31,583
That's right!

244
00:22:31,666 --> 00:22:34,875
That fish was my dinner,
and you ate it!

245
00:22:34,958 --> 00:22:36,791
But somebody left it.

246
00:22:36,875 --> 00:22:39,208
There! On that stick!

247
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:43,500
Oh, man! I was cooking
it on that stick, you idiot!

248
00:22:43,583 --> 00:22:44,875
[GOKU] Hmm?

249
00:22:44,958 --> 00:22:46,875
[NARRATOR] Out of the
fish fry and into the fire!

250
00:22:46,958 --> 00:22:50,166
Is this strange mountain
man friend or foe?

251
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:54,041
Find out on the next exciting
episode of Dragon Ball!
