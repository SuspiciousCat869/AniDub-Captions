Last time on Dragon Ball,

00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,208
the tournament's final
match was in full swing

attacked one another

Using the Afterimage Technique,

Goku managed to confuse Tien

00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:43,666
long enough to mount
a strong offensive,

10
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:47,000

successful until...

The young hero was stricken

12

by a mysterious,
paralyzing force

13
00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:55,208
that left him vulnerable
to Tien's assault.

00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:46,708
and bounced back on his feet!

169
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:48,125
[BOTH gasp]

170
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:49,875
[PUAR, OOLONG sigh]

171
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:51,166
[KRILLIN laughs]

172
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,166
It's my turn now!

173
00:15:57,541 --> 00:15:58,958
Goku, stop!

174
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:02,458
Ah!

175
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:07,708
He must die. I am your
master. Obey my command.

176
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:09,041
I have done as you asked...

177
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:11,250
I have defeated your
enemies and defended

178
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:13,166
the honor of our school.

179
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:16,208
The success of this match
is in my hands alone.

180
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:17,875
I do not need assistance.

181
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:20,250
Then prove it.
Destroy him at once!

182
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:23,000
No, I won't kill Goku. Doing so

183
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:25,791
would cause me to
lose this match.

184
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:29,750
Never mind the stupid match!
Make no mistake,

185
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:30,750
you are a killer!

186
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:32,875
Or do you forsake your destiny?!

187
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:37,541
No, Master... My destiny is not
what you'd have me believe...

188
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:39,166
I'm no killer.

189
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:41,333
[KRILLIN]
Oh...

190
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:42,375
Eh...

191
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:44,458
[SHEN growling]

192
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:48,250
You weak coward! Insolent fool!

193
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:52,583
You have allowed that senile
turtle hermit to warp your mind!

194
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:55,875
Uh, excuse me, but I can't
allow you to disrupt the f--

195
00:16:55,958 --> 00:17:01,041
[SHEN] I'm speaking! I made you,
Tien! All that you are

196
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:03,708
has sprung from
my generous hands!

197
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:08,416
And now your insubordination
has clenched them into fists!

198
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:11,958
Now you'll pay!
Chiaotzu, paralyze them both!

199
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:14,125
Chiaotzu!

200
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:17,708
I'm sorry, Master. I will
do anything you ask of me...

201
00:17:17,791 --> 00:17:20,375
But I cannot hurt Tien Shinhan.

202
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:22,041
[SHEN]
Come here!

203
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:26,000
[SHEN growling]

204
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:28,000
You dare defy me?!

205
00:17:28,666 --> 00:17:31,208
[SHEN] So, the dissent spreads
throughout the ranks!

206
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:34,166
Then you, too, can
share in Tien's fate!

207
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:38,458
Chiaotzu!

208
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:40,041
Get back!

209
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,250
Ha!

210
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:49,416
[SHEN screams]

211
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:56,833
[CROWD shouting, gasping]

212
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:02,666
[TIEN]
Master Shen!

213
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,666
[ROSHI]
Don't worry about him.

214
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:10,875
That bird will be sore for
a while, but he won't perish.

215
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:16,708
There will be plenty of time
to discuss all of this later.

216
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:18,083
Let's get back to the fight!

217
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:22,916
Sorry. I guess I was
wrong about you cheating.

218
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:29,000
For once... I'm at
a loss for words.

219
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:32,000
I have absolutely no explanation
for what you just saw.

220
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:33,916
Let's just hope
Master Shen doesn't land

221
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,958
on anyone important.
Just kidding, folks.

222
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:42,375
I have forsaken my Master.
All that is left

223
00:18:42,458 --> 00:18:44,708
for me now is this fight.

224
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:46,458
Let me make one thing clear.

225
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:50,416
This isn't about the rivalry
between our schools, or revenge.

226
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:54,833
I fight for one
purpose only: to win.

227
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:57,958
Never again will I be
led astray from my goal!

228
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:05,291
I'm glad. Let's get this
match back on track!

229
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:07,875
--[ROSHI laughs]
--[KRILLIN] Huh?

230
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:09,791
What's that all about?

231
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:13,208
I will win...
No matter how long...

232
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:16,833
...and no matter what
measures I have to take!

233
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:18,750
Okay. Let's go!

234
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:31,333
Whoa! Believe it or not,
it looks like

235
00:19:31,416 --> 00:19:32,750
the fight has resumed!

236
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:36,000

[CROWD cheers]

245
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:22,125
An unbelievable
counter-attack by Goku!

246
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:25,708
It looks like Tien is the
one eating floor this time!

247
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:32,000
One... two... three...

248
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:34,125
Tien recovers quickly
and it looks like

249
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:36,416
he's not too thrilled
with his opponent.

250
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:39,916
What's wrong? How come
you're not fighting back?

251
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,041
You didn't even
throw a single punch.

252
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:44,125
I've... paid my debt.

253
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:45,500
[GOKU]
What?

254
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:49,291
Chiaotzu's interference gave
me an unfair advantage.

255
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:51,041
Now we're even.

256
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:52,458
But, why wo--

257
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:53,916
[ROSHI]
A noble gesture.

258
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,125
Savor this moment,
because on my next attack,

259
00:20:57,208 --> 00:21:00,875
I will fight full-strength,
and you will go down.

260
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:06,583
Come on, Tien. I know you
can do it! Let him have it!

261
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:11,000

Oh?

264
00:21:23,541 --> 00:21:25,583
Eh? That's different.

265
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:29,083
[ANNOUNCER] Tien Shinhan is
attempting a difficult stunt...

266
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:32,333
I don't know what it is,
but it's definitely difficult.

267
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:43,125
[growling]

268
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:47,500
He... is going to stop
growing eventually, right?

270
00:21:53,416 --> 00:21:55,583
Yeah, the Four
Witches Technique.

271
00:21:55,666 --> 00:21:57,541
This is gonna be great!

Big, big arms!

279
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:38,666
[NARRATOR] Goku had
difficulty fighting Tien

280
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:42,083
when he had two arms.
How will he combat four?!

next time on Dragon Ball!
