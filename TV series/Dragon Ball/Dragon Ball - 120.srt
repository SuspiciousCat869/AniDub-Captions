[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball,

2
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:16,125
Tien Shinhan used the
Evil Containment Wave

3
00:02:16,208 --> 00:02:17,708
against King Piccolo.

4
00:02:17,791 --> 00:02:21,125
Unfortunately, Tien's
plan to trap Piccolo

5
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:24,166
blew up in his face.

6
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:27,625
Once again, the battle seemed
to shift in Piccolo's favor.

7
00:02:27,708 --> 00:02:30,583
Tien's misfire left him
drained of all energy

8
00:02:30,666 --> 00:02:32,583
and vulnerable to attack...

9
00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:35,625
It appeared as though the
brave warrior was done for.

--[PICCOLO] That's impossible!
--[PIANO gasps]

Goku returned for a rematch!

17
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:09,583
[TIEN]
Goku! Get out of there!

18
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:12,041
[DRUM]
You're not goin' anywhere runt!

19
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:14,916
No one treats me like that
and gets away with it!

20
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,166

Piccolo quickly realized

24
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:32,500
that this time, Goku
wasn't kidding around.

25

29
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:59,416
You're seeing live shots
from West City,

30
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,666
which King Piccolo
vowed to demolish!

31
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:05,625
A shockwave of panic
ran up the spine

32
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:07,458
of this magnificent metropolis

33
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:10,833
as citizens began
fleeing for their lives!

Oh.

35
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,250
Horrible...

36
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:16,916
Well, at least West City
hasn't been destroyed yet.

37
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,250
Most likely thanks
to Tien Shinhan

38
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:21,166

Uh...

42
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:32,458
If that dirt bag Piccolo
hurts him in any way,

43
00:04:32,541 --> 00:04:34,000
I'll make him pay!

44
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:37,416
Oh, I have a feeling Piccolo
has his hands full.

45
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,000
That's right!

46
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:40,500

One blow! I don't understand.

59

What happened to Goku? How could
he have become so powerful?

60
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:50,291
Of all people, I never
thought I would see you again.

61
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:53,125
How tenacious.
You dare get in my way?!

62
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:56,958
You bet I do. I will never stop
until I've defeated you!

63

You can try if you're feeling
suicidal... for you will die...

You think you're going
to be able to stop me?

It feels good, doesn't it?

00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:45,000
We're no different, you and I.
We both love inflicting pain.

It's an intoxicating
feeling, isn't it?!

Don't listen to him, Goku.

He's just playing mind games.
Strike him down!

Stop talking and fight...
Where's all your power?

a thing, do you?

You see, if I were to fight
you at full strength,

You should ask yourself
that question, Piccolo!

fill. Care to join him?

grave to gain the advantage.
