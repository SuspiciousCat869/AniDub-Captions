[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball,

2
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:16,916
in his quest to bring
his friends back to life,

3
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,833
Goku used his Power Pole to
launch high into the sky,

4
00:02:19,916 --> 00:02:23,791
and connected with a mystical
sanctuary known as the Lookout.

5
00:02:23,875 --> 00:02:25,500
[GOKU]
I made it!

6
00:02:25,583 --> 00:02:26,666
[NARRATOR]
Climbing onboard,

7
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,625
Goku had his first
encounter with someone

8
00:02:28,708 --> 00:02:30,791
he'll get to know very well.

9
00:02:30,875 --> 00:02:31,958
[POPO]
Nice to meet you!

10
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:33,500
If you want to see
the Earth's Guardian,

11
00:02:33,583 --> 00:02:36,375
you'll have to fight
with Mr. Popo first.

12
00:02:36,458 --> 00:02:37,541
Let's have a match!

13
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:39,083
[GOKU laughs]

Ouch!

16
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,750
[NARRATOR] Not only did Piccolo
take the lives of

17
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:48,875
Chiaotzu, Krillin,
Master Roshi, and others,

18
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:51,041
he also destroyed
the Eternal Dragon

19
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:53,375
so that no one could
use the Dragon Balls

20
00:02:53,458 --> 00:02:55,000
to wish them back to life.

21
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:58,958
The mysterious Guardian is
Goku's last hope to save them,

22
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:02,416
but he clearly has a
new problem on his hands.

23
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,958
[POPO] You have quite an
impressive power, little Goku,

24
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:07,208
but you have no idea
how to use it correctly.

25
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:09,291
You cannot beat me.
Please, go home.

[NARRATOR]
Goku's journey to the clouds

28
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,500
might have been made in vain.

29
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:16,583
Unless he proves himself
in this fight,

30
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:18,000
he cannot visit the Guardian,

31
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:20,875
and Mr. Popo seems to
have his number down.

32
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:23,166
Can Goku find another way?

33
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:25,875
Find out today, on Dragon Ball!

34
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:45,166
Looking after the
Guardian of the Earth

35
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,083
keeps me pleasantly
busy, little Goku.

36
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:50,875
While I do enjoy your company,
it is time for you to leave.

37
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:53,500
Wait! I can't leave!

38
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:55,625
Korin said coming up here
was the only way

39
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:57,791
to bring back
everybody Piccolo hurt!

40
00:03:57,875 --> 00:04:00,208
They were my best friends!

41
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:02,291
I'm not going!

You have a temper, don't you?

00:04:06,416 --> 00:04:06,916
[GOKU]
Yaah!

45

[POPO] I already told you,
you can't win.

Come on!

[grunts]

51
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:28,541
So persistent,

52
00:04:28,625 --> 00:04:31,166
however, lacking in mental
and physical discipline.

53
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,750
You'll be a great fighter...

...but not yet.

56
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:38,541
I can't believe it!

57
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:40,875
That hurt even more
than Piccolo's punches!

58
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:43,250
Yes, you beat him and so assumed

59
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:44,625
you were the
toughest in the world.

60
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:47,083
But learn this now:
No matter how strong you are,

61
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:49,875
there will always be someone
stronger who comes along.

62
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:51,333
To stay on top,

63
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:53,791
you must keep pushing past
what you think is strength.

64
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:54,833
[GOKU]
Mm-hmm...

65
00:04:54,916 --> 00:04:57,166
I feel pretty weak, now.

66
00:04:58,791 --> 00:05:01,833
I'm glad we had this little
chat. Now go on home, please.

67
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:04,291
What?! No! I have to
see the Guardian,

68
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:07,625
so my friends aren't dead any
longer than they have to be!

69
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:09,333
You wouldn't like it
if you were dead

70
00:05:09,416 --> 00:05:11,333
and your friends just
gave up on you, right?

71
00:05:11,416 --> 00:05:12,791
Well, I won't do it!

72
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:15,208
I'm sure they have
great board games to play.

73
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:17,875
Besides, you're not
strong enough to beat me.

74
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:20,458
Aah! Then I can
stay here and train!

75

Train? For what?

You know! Until I'm
strong enough to beat you!

Ah, yes. Well, I guess so,

79
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:30,833
but don't leave
skid marks on the tiles.

What a good-hearted boy he is.

I bet Mr. Popo is the
strongest in the universe!

I hope Goku's doing okay,
wherever he is.

85
00:05:57,083 --> 00:06:01,583
He said he was gonna go see some
sort of "Guardian of the Earth."

86
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:03,833
Yeah, poor kid really
thinks he can do something

87
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:06,500
to bring Krillin and
Master Roshi back.

88
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:11,791
If anybody can do it, I guess
a mystical planet-protector

89
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:13,166
would be the one.

90
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,666
[PUAR] You really think the
Guardian exists, Yamcha?

I don't know.

big muscles, I guess.

Oh, can it pig!

96
00:06:24,958 --> 00:06:26,875
We've already seen
the world's most evil person.

97
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:28,875
Maybe we'll see
the purest one, too.

98
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:31,958
Yeah. There's no telling
what to expect at this point.

99
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:35,583
All I know is if there's
a Guardian, Goku will find it.

100
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:37,375
That's right.

Well, if it does exist,
two things are certain.

[growls]

110

[TIEN] Goku. Our last fight
against Piccolo

111
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:19,708
showed I was nothing
compared to you.

112

But if a kid
can reach such powers,

trained master can do.

Tournament I will surpass you!

I'm tired!

122
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:09,666
The Lookout is at a
very high altitude, Goku.

123
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,250
The air's quite thin,

124
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:13,916
so breathing is
much more difficult.

125
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,541
To train without passing out,

126
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:17,875
you need to get rid of
your redundant moves.

127
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:20,791
Energy's far too precious
up here to be wasted.

How do I not waste it?

129
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:25,875
You must be more
tranquil than the sky,

130
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:27,958
yet quicker than lightning.

131
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,666
But the sky doesn't move.

132
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:35,833
And when I see lightning,
it's really quick!

Sounds pretty tricky to me!

Watch me. Empty your
mind of thoughts.

136

Do you notice how quiet it
is up here when nobody talks?

137
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:10,083
It's kinda creepy.

Oh! Sorry, I forgot.

Goku, you're just making
your eyes go blurry.

140
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:21,750
That's not the same thing
as emptying your mind.

00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:24,166
Wha--? Wow, this really is hard!

142
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:27,333
When that's done, you can
focus on not being a slug.

Mr. Popos here, are there?

scratching your right cheek.

That's even weirder!

[POPO]
Nope.

Then how come you can
see what I'm doing?

151
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:54,000
The answer is the same reason
why you couldn't see me moving.

152
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:56,541
You're only using
your eyes to see.

153
00:09:56,625 --> 00:10:00,083
True sight requires all
your senses, my young friend.

Feel the movements of the air
around me,

and then you'll be
able to see me.

That's a lot of stuff.
No wonder you keep beating me.

00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:16,000
Well, the Guardian of Earth
has taught me many things

161
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:17,166
in our years together.

162
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,916
I'd like to think
that I make him proud.

163
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,625
Whoa! Are you saying the
Guardian's even stronger

164
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:23,000
than you are?!

165
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:25,708
Oh yes, much stronger.
I'm a mouse compared to him.

166
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:28,541
[POPO]
Are you discouraged?

167
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:31,041
Not at all!
Now I'm more excited!

168
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,333
Two guys stronger than me,

169
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:36,916
who can beat me up
without even trying?

170
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,500
[GOKU laughs]

171
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:41,500
Yeah!

172
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:45,125
Goku. You're a peculiar boy.

173
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:48,083
Wait a second. If this Guardian
is stronger than both of us,

174
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:51,250
why didn't he come down
and beat Piccolo?

175
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:54,833
I am afraid his role
is not that simple.

176
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:58,000
Hey, I've got it!
I'm gonna stay here forever!

177
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:02,750
[GOKU chuckles, laughs]

178
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:05,916
[GOKu] Or at least until
I get strong enough

179
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,875
to beat both you guys!

180
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:08,541
Then I'm sure you'll help!

181
00:11:12,416 --> 00:11:14,375
[GOKU]
So, where d'you wanna start?

182
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:21,083
[DISPTCH] Come in,
Patrol Fifteen, come in.

183
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:23,000
We've got reports of
an unidentified intruder

184
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:24,916
in the northeast
corner of the park.

185
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,708
Investigate immediately.

186
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:01,666
[BOTH gasp]

187
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,125
[OFFICER A]
What is that?

188
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:09,708
You think it was shot?

189
00:12:09,791 --> 00:12:12,208
I don't see any kind
of an entrance wound.

190
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:13,833
Nah, we were just a
hundred yards away.

191
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:16,875
We would've heard a gun.
This is something else.

192
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:21,125
Whatcha got?

193
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:23,708
Heavy feet.

194
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:26,000
Looks human to me.
Poacher, maybe.

195
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:29,708
Should we call backup?

196
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:31,166
Nah.

197
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,625
Stop!

198
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:06,958
Look, it's just a kid.

199
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:09,416
Hey! Wait up!

200
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,250
Whatcha doin' here,
little sport? Did you get lost?

201
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:16,750
What's your name? Who're your
parents? Are they here, too?

202
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:18,833
You shouldn't be walking
around out here by yourself.

203
00:13:18,916 --> 00:13:20,583
You're safe now
that we've found you,

204
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:22,875
but there's a
poacher in the area.

205
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:26,458
Whoa, now, kid. Take it easy!
This isn't a cap gun, you know!

206
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:28,625
[yells]

207
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:35,041
Come any closer and I'll shoot!
I mean it! I mean it!

208
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:37,958
You freak! You're the one who
killed that bear, aren't you?

209
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:39,791
I... I-I said stay back!

210
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:46,875
[yelping]

211
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:49,250
Get back to the bikes!

212
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:52,833
My parents? Just one, Piccolo,

213
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:55,916
and he was kind enough to
give me everything he had.

214
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:11,750
I move less than
the sky, and yet...

215
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:13,333
...I move quicker
than lightning!

216
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:15,958
Always so cheerful
and determined.

217
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:18,750
Tell you what. I'll assist you.

218
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:21,416
Yay! I was hoping
you'd teach me how!

219
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,666
My brain hurts
when I think too much!

220
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:26,708
No, no, Goku. You still
have to learn on your own.

221
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:28,416
I'll just give hints.

222
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,833
That's stingy!

223
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:31,833
You're carrying a bell, correct?

224
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:35,958
Bell? Oh, hey!
Korin just gave me one.

225
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,458
[GOKU]
He said I'd need it.

226
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:43,041
So now what?

227
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:45,833
Try one more time
to hit Mr. Popo.

228
00:14:45,916 --> 00:14:49,458
Okay, but I've learned
a whole lot. Be warned!

229
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:50,916
Here goes.

230
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:56,875
Ow!

231
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:59,625
Darn it, I'm still not
quick enough!

232
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:01,666
And what else?

233
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:04,083
You back-flipped?

234
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:06,375
What happened before
you attacked me?

235
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:10,000
Well, let's see.
I gave you my bell.

236
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:12,291
[gasps]

237
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:22,875
You moved like an acrobat
to dodge my attack,

238
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:25,583
and the bell
never even made a peep!

239
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:28,000
How'd you do that?

240
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:30,000
Maybe you should try it.

241
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,791
Must've slipped. Hold on.

242
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:42,375
That's weird.

243
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:44,041
The bell's quiet around you,

244
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:46,208
but every time I move
it likes to ring.

245
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:48,375
I know! It's a trick, right?

246
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:50,416
Go home, Goku.

247
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,625
[GOKU]
No, wait! Don't leave, uh...

248
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:54,416
Did I say something wrong?

249
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:59,166
I look after the Earth's
Guardian, my boy.

250
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,416
I don't have time
for shenanigans.

251
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:05,333
Sorry. It just reminded me of
a prank Master Roshi pulled.

252
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:10,583
At least, Krillin told me it
was prank when we were finished,

253
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:12,625
but maybe it was for real.

254
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:34,750
Give it a whirl.

255
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:08,833
Krillin said Master Roshi
had pasted the jar to his head.

256
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:10,791
But maybe there is a way to move

257
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:12,208
that keeps water
from getting splashy,

258
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:14,750
and bells from ringing!

259
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:17,166
Water from getting splashy...

260
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:19,833
Hey! Water spills when you move
it one way

261
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:21,666
and then back in
the other direction.

262
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:22,958
That's like a bell!

263
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:24,833
If you just move it once,
it doesn't work.

264
00:17:24,916 --> 00:17:27,416
You have to keep
jingling it back and forth!

265
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:30,791
And those are
the redundant moves.

266
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:32,000
Then I win!

267
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:34,125
See, you're smart
when you try, Goku.

268
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:36,500
But knowing it won't be enough.

269
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:40,250
Right, I get it. I have to learn
how to really move that way.

270
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:43,583
But once I keep the bell quiet,
I can beat you, can't I?

271
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:46,708
Perhaps, but it could take
years of intense training.

272
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:48,708
And after you've
learned the technique,

273
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:51,750
there's still the chance you
won't be able to get past me.

274
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:53,625
[chuckles sheepishly]

275
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:10,750
You must decide.

276
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:13,666
Will you commit to years of
training that could end in vain?

277
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:18,166
You bet! I'll do whatever it
takes to bring my friends back!

278
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:20,375
[VOICE]
That's good to hear.

279
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:24,291
[GOKU] Hey, who's there?
Is that you, Mr. Guardian?

280
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:25,500
[POPO]
Exactly.

281
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:27,833

And he's talking to me?

282
00:18:27,916 --> 00:18:29,916
[GUARDIAN]
I will meet with you now.

283

[GOKU gasps]

284
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:34,791
You mean it? Before the years
of training? Ha ha ha! Yeah!

285
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:38,708
You're a fortunate boy,
Goku. This is rare.

286
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:40,583
[GOKU]
Thanks, Mr. Guardian!

[GOKU laughs]

288
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:53,208
[YAJIROBE] What's the deal?
Goku's been gone a while!

289
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:54,791
If all's going smoothly,

290
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:57,875
he should be seeing
the big boss about right now.

291
00:18:57,958 --> 00:18:59,875
Why's everyone making
such a big deal about it?

292
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:04,000
Didn't you say Goku's already
seen this Guardian guy before?

293
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:06,000
I was using some poetic license.

294
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:08,333
Trust me, this meeting
should be more fun

295
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:10,083
than you at a breakfast bar.

296
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:13,791

Don't move closer than this.

[GOKU] Okay! This is exciting,
isn't it? Wow, I can't wait!

00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:26,500
Where is he?

Remember, stay put.

306
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:42,708
I should've known
that you were still alive,

you big monster!

Let go of me! [growls]

You don't understand! He's the
bad guy I told you about!

314
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:02,375
It is you who fails to
understand. This is not Piccolo.

315
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:09,625
I should've known Korin
wouldn't explain it to you.

Did you say Korin?

318
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,041
He thinks he's very funny.

319
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:20,500
[GUARDIAN]
There's a good reason

320
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:23,166
you mistook me
for Piccolo, my boy.

321
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:26,666
Ages ago,
we two beings were one.

322
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:29,791
A single coin
with two opposing sides.

323
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:34,166
My name is Kami, and I am indeed
the guardian of this planet.

324
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:36,416
But it wasn't always that way.

325
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,625
What do you mean?

326
00:20:37,708 --> 00:20:40,250
Guardians are a mortal lot,
much like you.

327
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:42,166
There was a guardian before me,

328
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:45,583
and I sensed that his end
was approaching.

329
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:49,041
I made the same trek that
you did, up to this Lookout,

330
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:51,375
hoping to become his successor.

331
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:53,333
But he turned his back on me.

332
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,583
[KAMI] I strongly believed that
I was destined to replace him,

333
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:01,041
but in his great wisdom,

334
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:04,500
he saw in me a side
I was too proud to admit.

335
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:07,041
You see, a guardian's
motives must be pure.

336
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:11,583
Yet in me was a selfish desire
for its power and control,

337
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:15,375
a side that thrived
on bitterness and hate.

338
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:18,833
For many brutal years
I meditated and trained,

339
00:21:18,916 --> 00:21:22,500
until I was finally able
to separate my impure desire

340
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:24,958
and drive it out of my body.

341
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:29,375
That evil became Piccolo.

342
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:32,291
While in my purified form,
I remained at the Lookout

343
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:33,666
and became the next Guardian,

344
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:36,875
Piccolo went down to the
Earth to incite disorder.

345
00:21:36,958 --> 00:21:39,916
It's been a great
source of guilt for me.

346
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,708
But you, Goku, have stopped
him in his boldest assault.

347
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:45,375
And in gratitude, I will
give ear to your request.

348
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:47,875
[laughs]

349
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:50,291
But on one condition. You must
remain here and train under me

350
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:52,791
for as long as
my own motives require.

351
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:55,291
Of course!
I wanted to do that anyway!

352
00:21:55,375 --> 00:21:57,916
Now I can tell you which
friends to bring back, right?

353
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,791
I know. Krillin, Chiaotzu,
Master Roshi, Nam,

354
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:03,500
all the other fighters.

355
00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:05,833
Unfortunately,
my powers as guardian

356
00:22:05,916 --> 00:22:07,083
will not bring them back.

357
00:22:07,166 --> 00:22:09,000
Uh...

358
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:12,750
The one being that has that
ability is Shenron, the Dragon.

359
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:15,416
I guess I'll simply
have to recreate him,

360
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,250
and let the Earthlings use
the Dragon Balls again.

361
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:21,041
You can really do that, Kami?

362
00:22:21,125 --> 00:22:23,541
[KAMI]
Yes, but I do so begrudgingly.

363
00:22:23,625 --> 00:22:24,916
From now on, Goku,

364
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,833
you must take greater care
to protect your friends

365
00:22:26,916 --> 00:22:29,375
and secure the power
of the dragon.

366
00:22:29,458 --> 00:22:31,000
I promise to!

367
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:33,541
Good. I will hold you to that.

368
00:22:33,625 --> 00:22:35,125
Now, Mr. Popo,

369
00:22:35,208 --> 00:22:38,500
I would like to begin recreating
the Eternal Dragon immediately.

370
00:22:38,583 --> 00:22:40,333
--[POPO] Yes, Kami.
--Thank you, thank you,

371
00:22:40,416 --> 00:22:43,125
thank you, thank you, thank
you, Mr. Kami-Guardian!

372
00:22:43,208 --> 00:22:44,750
[GOKU laughs]

373
00:22:44,833 --> 00:22:45,750
[POPO laughs]

374
00:22:45,833 --> 00:22:46,750
Yeah!

375
00:22:46,833 --> 00:22:48,833
[NARRATOR]
Goku has won his wish.

376
00:22:48,916 --> 00:22:52,375
His friends and the Eternal
Dragon will soon be revived.

377
00:22:52,458 --> 00:22:55,333
But what will
Goku's training entail?
