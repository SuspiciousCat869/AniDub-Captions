00:02:11,541 --> 00:02:13,583
[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball,

2
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:16,333
King Piccolo's sinister plot
to regain his youth

3
00:02:16,416 --> 00:02:19,208
through the power of the
Dragon Balls was revealed.

4
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:22,250
The only obstacle in his
way was Master Roshi,

5
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:25,541
determined to prevent the
monster from claiming his prize

6
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:27,625
and taking over the world.

7
00:02:30,791 --> 00:02:34,583
Piccolo proved to be
a dangerous adversary.

8
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:41,416
Attempting to
capture the creature,

9
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,625
the Turtle Hermit
went on the offensive

10
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:45,750
using the
Evil Containment Wave

11
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:48,583
to trap Piccolo
in the Electronic Jar.

12
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:02,833
He failed.

13
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:05,916
I-I missed it!

14
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,583
[NARRATOR] By a twist of fate,

15
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:10,541
the battle shifted
in favor of Piccolo,

16
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:14,958
who, while exhausted from
the ordeal, retained control.

17
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:20,083
Master Roshi had
depleted all his energy,

18
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:23,875
and with nothing left to give,
succumbed to fatigue.

19
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:26,208
King Piccolo
claimed the Dragon Balls

20
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:28,958
and called forth
the Eternal Dragon.

21
00:03:31,458 --> 00:03:33,291
Magnificent!

22
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:50,125
[screaming]

23
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:22,250
Incredible!

24
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:23,458
[LAUNCH]
What's going on?!

25
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:25,958
There wasn't supposed
to be a storm today!

26
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:28,541
Why do we even have weathermen?!

27
00:04:28,625 --> 00:04:30,375
[OOLONG]
It can't be a solar eclipse.

28
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:32,250
We'd need a moon for that!

29
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,750
All seven Dragon Balls
are now gathered together.

30
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:44,875
Someone must have called
upon the Eternal Dragon.

31
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:49,208
Hmm. It could be Master Roshi
or King Piccolo!

32
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:51,000
I wonder which one!

33
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:53,000
I don't want to know!

34
00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:05,958
[DRAGON roaring]

35
00:05:14,791 --> 00:05:17,750
The Eternal Dragon! You're here!

36
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:23,625
After all this time, my greatest
desire will finally come true!

37
00:05:23,708 --> 00:05:27,541
[laughing]

38
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:39,375
[TIEN thinking]
Chiaotzu! Can you hear me?

39
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:40,958
Tien Shinhan!

40
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:43,708
[TIEN thinking] We have to
do something about this!

41
00:05:43,791 --> 00:05:46,666
Now I want you to
listen to me very carefully.

42
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:49,541
I'm losing consciousness
because of that strange medicine

43
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:51,458
Master Roshi gave me.

44
00:05:51,541 --> 00:05:53,708
This is up to you.

45
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,666
Before Piccolo
can make his wish,

46
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,750
I want you to make your own.

47
00:05:57,833 --> 00:05:59,125
Tell the Dragon you wish that

48
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:03,625
King Piccolo would disappear
from this world forever!

49
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:05,958
Mm-hmm! Okay!

50
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:21,708
I will grant one wish.
Tell me what it is you desire.

51
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:25,083
At last!

52
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:32,250
I...

53
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:34,000
I wish for...

54
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:38,666
Make King Piccolo...

55
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,208
...disappear...

56
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:42,375
...from this...

57
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:49,708
[CHIAOTZU yelling]

58
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:08,666
Tien...

59
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:12,708
Chiaotzu!

60
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:16,583
[TIEN thinking]
No! Please no, not him!

61
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:21,416
I despise uninvited guests.

62
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:26,875
What do you wish for?

63
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:31,250
I wish to be made young again!
Restore my youth and power.

64
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:35,583
Return to me what time
has stolen! Can you do this?!

65
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:38,041
As you wish.

66
00:07:57,875 --> 00:08:01,958
It's happening!
His Majesty is growing young!

67
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:25,958
[laughing]

68
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:30,250
It worked!
I'm young again! I am...

69
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:32,250
...born anew!

70
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:36,208
[PILAF] We won! We won!
His youth has returned!

71
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:38,041
Hooray for King Piccolo!

72
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:40,250
Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!

73
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:45,666
Your wish has been granted.
I take my leave.

74
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:48,500
There's one more thing
you can do for me.

75
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:58,041
[roaring]

76
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,416
They are nothing but stones now.

77
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,125
[laughing]

78
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:39,041
And the Dragon is dead!

79
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:41,958
My enemies are vanquished.

80
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:44,250
No one will ever
challenge me again!

81
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:55,625
It is perfect!
I have been reborn!

82
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:59,000
Congratulations, sire.
You did it!

83
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:04,583
I'm looking forward to the day
King Piccolo conquers the world.

84
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:06,166
Then he'll...

85
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:09,208
...be so grateful, he'll give
you that swampland you wanted!

86
00:10:11,125 --> 00:10:13,166
[CROWD] Pilaf! Pilaf!

87
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:15,208
[chanting continues]

88
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,083
Hi!

89
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:35,333
[giggling]

90
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:53,791
I feel invincible!

91
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:06,750
Hey! Look at that! It's gotten
bright all of a sudden!

92
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:14,083
I can't get a signal
on the Dragon Balls.

93
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:17,083
I was right. Someone
already called the Dragon.

94
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:20,833
I'd sure like to see
this dragon of yours.

95
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:22,666
I hope it wasn't Piccolo.

96
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:25,125
There's no telling
what he'd ask for.

97
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:44,458
Whoa! I think I see it!
Is that Korin's Tower up ahead?

98
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:12,625
[BULMA]
It just went dead!

99
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:17,125
The signal is gone!

100
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:23,708
All right. So what
explanations are we looking at?

101
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,500
The most positive scenario is
that Master Roshi was able

102
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:31,541
to call for the Eternal Dragon
before King Piccolo.

103
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:34,750
If that's the case, the monsters
are no longer on this world.

104
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:37,625
Oh yeah, good one.
It sounds reasonable enough.

105
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:40,916
I mean, justice always
prevails in the end, right?

106
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,125
I sure hope
that's what happened.

107
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:51,583
If Master Roshi didn't win,

108
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:53,750
and King Piccolo
used the Dragon Balls,

109
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:57,291
then I wonder what
it is he wished for.

110
00:12:57,375 --> 00:12:58,875
From what we know of him,

111
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:01,708
I'd say he wished
for something diabolical,

112
00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:03,541
like the end of the world.

113
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:04,583
[shrieks]

114
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:07,708
Mm-hmm! That's quite possible.

115
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:11,041
Gee, why is everyone so
pessimistic around here?

116
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:13,916
[laughs awkwardly]

117
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,625
Anyway, we can't afford
to hang around here.

118
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:18,625
Bulma, give me the last
coordinates on the radar

119
00:13:18,708 --> 00:13:19,583
before it died.

120
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:21,125
I'll go check it out.

121
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:23,583
Wait a minute, Yamcha. I think
you're jumping the gun here.

122
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:25,833
If you're right and
Master Roshi did win,

123
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:28,166
then he'll probably
try to reach us here.

124
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:30,875
I think we should just
stay put and ride it out.

125
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:35,500
I know, you're probably right.
I'm just tired of doing nothing!

126
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:45,666
I'm starving.

127
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:49,833
Please tell me this tower we're
heading for has some good food!

128
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:52,625
I can guarantee it.

129
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:55,083
By the way, you still haven't
told me about the person

130
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:56,666
you're going to meet
if we get there.

131
00:13:56,750 --> 00:14:00,083
His name is Korin.
He's a master of martial arts.

132
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:02,958
I used to take lessons
from him a long time ago.

133
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:06,916
He really knows his stuff, huh?
Who do you think is stronger?

134
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,333
Korin or King Piccolo?

135
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:11,333
Hmm. It's hard to say.

136
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:15,041
You have to think about it?
Man, this cat must be strong!

137
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:17,250
So what does
he look like, anyway?

138
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:20,166
Hmm... He's furry
and has big ears.

139
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:21,625
Huh?!

140
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:24,583
In other words,
he's an ugly beast.

141
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:31,208
This is a friend of yours?
He doesn't sound nice to me.

142
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:34,041
He's not going to try and
eat us for brektis, is he?

143
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:35,333
[laughs]

144
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:37,291
You're funny, Yajirobe.

145
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:46,041
It's time to
get down to business.

146
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:48,583
This world will soon be mine!

147
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:52,041
Yes! The world will soon
be under our control!

148
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:55,583
Full speed ahead!
Take me to the king's castle!

149
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:57,541
I'm don't think
the direct approach

150
00:14:57,625 --> 00:14:59,416
is the way to handle this.

151
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:02,541
Hm? Do my tactics trouble you?

152
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:04,666
Of course not!
You have great tactics!

153
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,375
It's that this
castle we're going to

154
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:07,750
has some impressive weapons

155
00:15:07,833 --> 00:15:10,708
and I thought maybe
we should get an... upgrade?

156
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:15,375
No, wait! Scratch that!
We don't need an upgrade.

157
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:18,000
Our current systems
should do just fine!

158
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,291
[laughing tauntingly]

159
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:23,166
You foolish twerp! Now that King
Piccolo has regained his youth,

160
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:26,125
no weapon on the
planet can destroy him.

161
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:27,541
Yes, I see!

162
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:30,583
Well, uh, no sense in
hanging around here any longer.

163
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:32,333
We've got a castle to conquer!

164
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:53,958
[VILLAGER] Sire, I beg of you.
Please help my village.

165
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:57,666
This drought has
lasted over 6 months!

166
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,250
There isn't enough
water for drinking,

167
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:00,916
let alone to grow our crops.

168
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,500
We can't last much longer.

169
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:06,500
I understand your needs.
I will help.

170
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:08,916
Sire, you mean--

171
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,708
I will send the Aqua-Squad
to your aid immediately.

172
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:16,625
Thank you, sire!

173
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:19,833
Do not thank me.
I share your happiness.

174
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:22,208
My lifelong dream is that
everyone in the world

175
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:25,791
will one day live
in perfect harmony.

176
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:27,291
Sire.

177
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:47,166
[TIEN thinking]
Master Roshi! Chiaotzu!

178
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:48,833
I can't believe you're gone.

179
00:16:48,916 --> 00:16:51,250
I never should have sent
you out there, Chiaotzu.

180
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:54,750
Master told us to stay
out of it, but I didn't listen.

181
00:16:56,708 --> 00:17:00,458
Piccolo! I'll never
forgive you for this!

182
00:17:12,916 --> 00:17:15,125
I know I can't defeat Piccolo,

183
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:19,000
but I have to avenge
my friends. I have to!

184
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:29,208
I-I can't believe it.
Impossible!

185
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:31,583
Evil Containment!

186
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:39,708
[screaming]

187
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:04,833
The wave...
If only I could use it!

188
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:14,500
We'll be arriving at the
castle in ten minutes, my king.

189
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:16,375
Reports tell me
that the present king

190
00:18:16,458 --> 00:18:19,875
is nothing more than a
bleeding heart peace-lover.

191
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:20,958
[laughs]

192
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:22,041
It's the sentimental ones

193
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:24,291
who are always
my favorite to destroy.

194
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:26,000
Don't you agree?

195
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:27,666
Oh, yes, uh...

196
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:28,708
[laughs nervously]

197
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,250
My reign over this planet
is close at hand.

198
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:35,208
With my ascension I shall
create a magnificent kingdom

199
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:36,791
in my own image.

200
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:40,041
[laughing]

201
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:43,625
However, before I can rebuild,
I must first tear down!

202
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:51,500
I'd like the honor
of being the first

203
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:53,708
to give my
sincere congratulations

204
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:55,708
to our new ruler.

205
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:57,708
I would also like
to remind his majesty

206
00:18:57,791 --> 00:19:00,666
of our agreement that upon
his conquest of the world

207
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:02,291
I would get a piece of it.

208
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:04,208
We discussed some
marshlands earlier,

209
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:07,458
but given our successful coup,
I'd like to renegotiate.

210
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:09,708
Well! As you wish.

211
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:12,583
Piano, go down to the operating
room and take the wheel.

212
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:14,291
Send our other guests up here.

213
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,041
I am most grateful, sire.

214
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:25,041
[SHU, MAI gasp]

215
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:30,791
Might I inquire which
part of the world is mine?

216
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:32,625
As much...

217
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:34,458
Huh?

218
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:37,291
As much as you can
carry on the way down.

219
00:19:39,791 --> 00:19:44,541
You have such humor, sire. What
do you mean "on the way down"?

220
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:48,250
Isn't is obvious? We're having
a falling out, literally.

221
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:53,416
But, your majesty, please! This
is a terrible misunderstanding!

222
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,916
We've worked so hard for you.

223
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,083
Don't forget, I'm the one
who brought you back to life!

224
00:19:58,166 --> 00:19:59,958
I'm your savior!

225
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:03,750
You're nothing but an inept
clown surrounded by amateurs.

226
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:09,750
Say goodbye.

227
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:11,958
No, no please!
Give me another chance!

228
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:14,208
I'm begging you!
Please, sire, please!

229
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:18,750
Quit sniveling. You're the
one who wanted renegotiate.

230
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:33,875
[all whimpering in fear]

231
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:38,375
Ya know,
I'm really good at windows.

232
00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:42,500
[yelling]

233
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:05,041
[YAJIROBE] Okay, we're here,
wherever here is.

234
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,750
Funny, this doesn't
look like a place

235
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:11,500
where they'd
have some good food.

236
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:18,625
Don't worry. Everything's fine.
Nothing's changed.

237
00:21:18,708 --> 00:21:20,750
It's Goku!

238
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:21,708
Upa!

239
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:23,125
Goku!

240
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:30,125
Good to see you!
It's been a long time.

241
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:33,916
How have you been, Upa?
You've gotten taller.

242
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,875
Yes!

243
00:21:35,958 --> 00:21:40,500
Father! Father! Come quick!
Goku is here to visit us!

244
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:44,791
Just remember,
you promised this visit

245
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:46,583
would include a lot of food.

246
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:48,166
Don't worry.

247
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:54,958
Oh, Goku!

248
00:21:56,166 --> 00:21:57,625
Bora!

249
00:21:57,708 --> 00:22:00,041
It's good to see you,
old friend.

250
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:09,750
[SHU]
Are we there yet?

251
00:22:09,833 --> 00:22:12,041
From here on, I think
we should choose our allies

252
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:13,875
with more scrutiny, sire.

253
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:15,208
Be quiet!

254
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:24,625
It begins.
Let rise the flames of chaos.

255
00:22:24,708 --> 00:22:28,625
Scorch the earth 'til
all I see withers and dies!

256
00:22:30,083 --> 00:22:35,625
[laughing]

257
00:22:37,083 --> 00:22:40,083
[NARRATOR] With restored youth
and limitless power,

258
00:22:40,166 --> 00:22:43,583
King Piccolo sets out
to conquer the world.

259
00:22:43,666 --> 00:22:46,708
Can anyone oppose
his reign of evil?

260
00:22:46,791 --> 00:22:49,958
What fate awaits
Goku and his allies?

261
00:22:50,041 --> 00:22:54,916
Don't miss the next unbelievable
adventure of Dragon Ball!
