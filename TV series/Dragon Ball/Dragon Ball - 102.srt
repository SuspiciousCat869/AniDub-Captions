00:02:11,416 --> 00:02:13,500
[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball...

2
00:02:13,583 --> 00:02:16,041
While celebrating
Tien Shinhan's victory

3
00:02:16,125 --> 00:02:17,541
over the Martial
Arts Tournament,

4
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:20,958
cheer gave way to despair as
Goku was gripped with fear

5
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:22,750
over the absence of Krillin,

6
00:02:22,833 --> 00:02:24,250
who had left the party

7
00:02:24,333 --> 00:02:27,416
to retrieve Goku's four-star
Dragon Ball and Power Pole.

8
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,375
[NARRATOR]
Unfortunately,

9
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:34,333
Krillin's promise of a quick
return was never realized.

10
00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:35,708
Overcome with dread,

11
00:02:35,791 --> 00:02:38,333
Goku raced in search
of his missing friend.

12
00:02:38,416 --> 00:02:41,416
What he found was unimaginable.

13
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:49,875
[GOKU screams]

14
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:55,541
[GOKU]
No, Krillin, I'm here. Wake up!

15
00:02:56,833 --> 00:02:57,875
Krillin!

16
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:01,333
He's gone...

17
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:06,583
[NARRATOR]
And now, our story continues.

18
00:03:16,041 --> 00:03:17,791
[panting]

19
00:03:21,666 --> 00:03:22,416
Hm?

20
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,666
Huh?

21
00:03:32,708 --> 00:03:34,625
What happened, Goku?

22
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:35,791
Huh?

23
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:36,916
Oh, no!

24
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,208
Impossible!

25
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:44,541
Poor Krillin...

26
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:49,000
He's dead.

27
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:52,000
[gasps]

28
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:03,458
It can't be true. It can't!

29
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:04,500
[ALL gasp]

30
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:05,833
Easy.

31
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:08,083
[ANNOUNCER] It was a monster.
A hideous monster!

32
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:10,916
It took a strange ball
covered with stars

33
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,875
and a list of the
Martial Arts Society.

34
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:16,000
A Dragon Ball and names?!

35
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:17,416
A monster.

36
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,458
[ANNOUNCER]
Krillin...

37
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:21,333
He tried to stop the beast,

38
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:22,583
but it was too strong.

39
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:25,791
That boy fought with
everything he had.

40
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:31,666
[GOKU sobbing]

41
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:33,916
Krillin, he's gone.

42
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:41,583
He didn't deserve this!

43
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:47,083
Bulma, do you have
the Dragon Radar?!

44
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:48,000
Yes.

45
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:49,708
Goku, wait!

46
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:52,583
Come back here!

47
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:54,291
Stop!

48
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:56,291
That's an order!

49
00:04:58,041 --> 00:04:59,166
[YAMCHA]
Goku!

50
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:32,250
There are two near
here. Which one?

51
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:36,000
Have to guess!

52
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:38,500
And hope I choose the right one!

53
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:42,291
[TURTLE panting]

54
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:46,375
Tha-That's it. From now on,
this turtle's taking a taxi!

55
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:47,666
Goku.

56
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,250
Impetuous!

57
00:05:52,416 --> 00:05:55,083
That thing was strong
enough to kill Krillin.

58
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:58,250
And Goku running off
right after a big match--

59
00:05:58,333 --> 00:06:00,958
He won't have the
energy to defeat it!

60
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:10,708
He was a brave soldier.

61
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:13,083
Not fair.

62
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:17,750
Who could be so cruel?

63
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:21,000
I found this piece of
paper lying on the ground.

64
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:23,250
Do you think it has
anything to do with it?

65
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:29,291
It's the word Devil, circled.

66
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:32,875
Devil? That sounds creepy.

67
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:34,125
[ROSHI gasps]

68
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:38,625
Let me see!

69
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:46,291
[ROSHI] No! It's impossible.
It can't be true!

70
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:50,291
What's the matter?

71
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:52,083
Master, what does that mean?

72
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:58,208
[grunts] Master Roshi?

73
00:06:58,291 --> 00:07:03,125
This is... This is the
crest of King Piccolo.

74
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:05,958
King Piccolo?

75
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:09,333
Piccolo? Someone actually
admits to having that name?

76
00:07:09,416 --> 00:07:11,291
I've heard that name.

77
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:13,500
It's a legendary creature

78
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:15,250
that is said to have
thrown the world

79
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:17,791
into the depths
of terror ages ago.

80
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:19,875
It's true.

81
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:29,208
[ROSHI] His name may sound
funny, but I can assure you...

82
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:34,583
There's nothing humorous
about that savage beast!

83
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:36,875
With him came
darkness and chaos.

84
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:40,541
His minions of terror
wreaked havoc upon the land,

85
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:45,208
destroying all in their path
with indiscriminate fury.

86
00:07:57,291 --> 00:08:00,000

[whimpering]

98
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:07,000
[ROSHI] No one knew what they
wanted or why they had come.

99
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:11,958
But they were here, laughing as
our world crumbled around them.

100
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:15,666
Piccolo and his army destroyed
one city after another

101
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:19,958
with little opposition,
except for one temple.

102
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:22,125
It was in this
secluded sanctuary

103
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:25,291
the beasts faced a meager
but determined school

104
00:09:25,375 --> 00:09:27,041
of martial artists.

105
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:32,666
[ROSHI]
As the horde invaded the temple,

106
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:37,500
the young fighters banded
together for a final assault.

107
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:39,333
Though hopelessly outnumbered,

108
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:40,541
they were united.

109
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:42,625
And with their
combined strength,

110
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:45,125
they offered a
formidable defense.

111
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:52,958
[ROSHI] Many demons fell
that day, and alongside them,

112
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:54,750
even more great men.

113
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:56,375
When the battle was over,

114
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:59,958
only two of the warriors
were left standing.

115
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,791
[ROSHI]
Myself and Crane Hermit.

116
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:06,708
Unfortunately, the skirmish

117
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:09,708
had barely made a dent
in Piccolo's forces.

118
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:13,958
[ROSHI]
Desperate and out of time,

119
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:17,250
we concentrated our
remaining energy into a shield

120
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:19,625
that absorbed the
enemy fire and,

121
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:23,250
with a breath of luck,
reflected it back at them.

122
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:32,291
[ROSHI] One bright light...
That's all I remember.

123
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:36,333
But somehow, it worked.
The horde was vanquished.

124
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:40,291
It was finally over
or so we thought.

125
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:45,000
[ROSHI] Apparently, the monsters
were just an opening act

126
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:47,041
for King Piccolo himself.

127
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:49,583
We barely got a
glimpse of his ugly mug

128
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:53,666
before he dismissed us
with a wave of his hand.

129
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:57,583
Against his might, we were but
rag dolls caught in a storm.

130
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:10,125
Shen and I were
young and in our prime.

131
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:14,458
We gave everything we had, and
still, King Piccolo prevailed.

132
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:17,833
All those lives lost and we
didn't lay a scratch on him!

133
00:11:17,916 --> 00:11:21,916
He was immune to
everyone, even Mutaito!

134
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,333
Who's Mutaito?

135
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:25,875
[ROSHI]
He was my master.

136
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:47,666
Why have you attacked?

137
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:51,083
This massacre was
completely senseless!

138
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:54,583
[PICCOLO] Do you want the truth?
That it was mere amusement.

139
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:58,750
Or do you need a
higher purpose? Perhaps fate.

140
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:03,875
[MUTAITO] But we pose no threat.
We are seekers of peace.

141
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:07,375
[PICCOLO]
And you shall find it in death.

142
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:10,958
I tried to be nice.

143
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:13,750
Now we'll do it the hard way.

144
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:20,291
[PICCOLO]
Foolish.

145

150
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,375
[PICCOLO] Very good.
Where did you learn to dance?

151
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:35,958
[groaning]

152
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:40,041
Master Mutaito is
completely under his control!

153
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:41,875
No, it's not true!

154
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:47,041
[PICCOLO]
What's so hard about that?

155
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,333
Master, no!

156
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:56,291
[laughing]

157
00:12:56,375 --> 00:13:00,791
[groans]

158
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:04,708
[ROSHI] Thanks to
a strong immune system,

159
00:13:04,791 --> 00:13:07,250
and my extraordinary
bedside manner,

160
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:10,708
Master Mutaito
made a full recovery.

161
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:14,916
However, exterior wounds
tend to heal much faster

162
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,791
than those we keep inside.

163
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:18,250
For my master,

164
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:21,166
the shame of being dishonored
in front of his students

165
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:23,541
and the loss of the ones
he couldn't protect,

166
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:25,791
was more than he could bear.

167
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:29,125
Unwilling to continue
his teaching, he left,

168
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:33,166
hoping time could mend
what his heart could not.

[GOKU panting]

170
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:46,083
Never should've happened!
Not to him. Not to Krillin!

171
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:47,125
You'll pay for this!

172
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:50,166
Do you hear me?!
You're gonna pay!

173
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:51,666
[YAMCHA]
It's strange picturing you

174
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,458
and the Crane Hermit as friends.

175
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:56,416
What you went through,
I had no idea.

176
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:00,250
[sighs] Neither did I. Crane
Hermit never spoke of his past.

177
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:01,500
Not to us.

178
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:02,750
Yeah.

179
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:05,125
[ROSHI] Something changed
in Shen that day.

180
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:07,125
I could see it in his eyes.

181
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:10,208
It was as if goodness
itself had betrayed him.

182
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:12,250
Whether it was our
Master's leaving

183
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:15,791
or just the alluring
power of evil, who knows.

184
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:17,250
He snapped.

185
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:22,958
The man I knew, my friend,
was gone. Another casualty.

186
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:25,041
[OOLONG]
Gee, that's too bad.

187
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:28,916
So what happened next?! How did
you defeat King Piccolo?!

188
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,250
[ROSHI] I didn't. King Piccolo
continued his rampage,

189
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:35,875
covering the land in
a sea of fire and ash.

190
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,458
Unable to defeat him, I fled.

191
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:41,541
[OOLONG] You ran?! I would
have stood my ground.

192
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:43,791
[ROSHI] Obviously, you've
never fought a titan!

193
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:46,250
If flesh and blood
were as strong as pride,

194
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:48,958
we would all be invincible.

195
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:52,041
Fortunately, I found
refuge in the mountains,

196
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:55,041
where I continued my
training as best I could.

197
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:57,000
But as the years passed,

198
00:14:57,083 --> 00:15:02,166
I lost hope and began to feel
the weight of my solitude.

199
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:05,583
Then one day,
that hope returned.

200
00:15:08,416 --> 00:15:10,958
[ROSHI] My mentor had
spent his time away

201
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:12,458
strengthening his abilities

202
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:15,375
and in search of a means
to defeat King Piccolo,

203
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:18,083
which he had finally discovered.

204
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:23,833
[MUTAITO] Cease fire
and surrender, Piccolo!

205
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:26,708
Or face the consequences.

206
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:29,333
[PICCOLO]
0h, I prefer to watch you dance.

207
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:38,250
[PICCOLO]
Enjoy.

208
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:41,250
[PICCOLO]
What?!

209
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:47,625
[yells]

210
00:15:49,291 --> 00:15:51,125
[ROSHI]
The Evil Containment Wave

211
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:53,833
successfully trapped
King Piccolo.

212
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:55,833
[MUTAITO]
Open the jar! Now!

213
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:58,291
[ROSHI] The electronic jar
my master had acquired

214
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:02,250
was specifically designed
to hold and contain evil.

215
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:05,333
[MUTAITO]
Quickly, close it! Close it!

216
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:14,166
[ROSHI] Piccolo's fate was
sealed, but at a heavy price.

217
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:16,166
Having used up
all of his energy,

218
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:20,750
Master Mutaito could not endure
the affects of the battle.

219
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:23,416
He gave his life
to save others,

220
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:27,083
and in doing so,
regained his honor.

221
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:28,708
As for Piccolo,

222
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:31,333
I obeyed my master's
last command

223
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:34,125
and threw the jar into the sea.

224
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:41,583
No one has ever seen or heard
from King Piccolo since...

225
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:43,875
Until today.

226
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:48,500
Oh no! What if Crane Hermit
found it and opened it again?!

227
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:51,416
[ROSHI] No. Shen, more than
anyone, understands the danger

228
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:54,000
of releasing King Piccolo
from his prison.

229
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:56,583
But, Master, the note and
description of the monster

230
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:59,375
suggest it could be one
of Piccolo's minions.

231
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:00,916
[OOLONG, PUAR whimper]

232
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,666
Where did you say
those mountains were?

233
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:07,333
[ROSHI thinking] If you're
right, Goku's in grave danger.

234
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:17,208
[GOKU yelps]

235
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:27,750
There's more than one way
to get across. Flying Nimbus!

236
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:39,208
[gasps]

237
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:47,833
[GOKU]
There you are.

238
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:03,625
Faster, Nimbus.
He's straight ahead of us!

239
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:12,666
What will we do if the
monsters come back?!

240
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,666
This is horrible.

241
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:17,041
Even if King Piccolo
is responsible,

242
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:20,375
there's a chance Goku
won't be able to find him.

243
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:22,083
Don't bet on it, pal.

244
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:24,958
That's why he took
Bulma's Dragon Radar.

245

[ROSHI]
What's he after?

246
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:29,250
I understand taking
the Dragon Ball.

247
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:33,708
But why steal a member list
of the Martial Arts Society?

248

Wait a minute! What's all
this talk about dragons?

249
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:40,500
Radars, balls! What's that
got to do with anything?

250
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,500
Goku, what are you
getting yourself into?

251
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:08,666
Seven for one wish.
I like the sound of that.

[cackles]

253
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:15,291
It is marvelous.
Born leaders, like us,

254

to rule the world!

I don't need magic
balls to rule this Earth.

It has fallen at
my feet once before.

[SHU]
Then what do you want?

259
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:35,041
The greatest prize
of all, eternal youth.

260
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:42,625
Just think. With eternal youth,
I could master time itself!

261
00:19:42,708 --> 00:19:45,916
Why would I wish to rule
this planet for a lifetime

262
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,875
when I could rule
it for all time!

263
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:50,416
Yes, I agree.

264

By the way...

there's something I'd
like to run past you.

If you recall,

00:19:57,375 --> 00:19:59,791
it was I who plucked
you from the cold sea

268
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:01,166
and freed you from that jar,

269

brought you here
to my aerial palace

270
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:05,125
to recuperate in lavish style.

271

Did you get those
grapes I sent you?

272
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:09,625
And I even briefed you on
the Dragon Balls, remember?

273
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,750
Get to the point, Pilaf.

[PILAF, MAI, SHU yelp]

I know you have
a busy schedule.

But, Lord Piccolo,

277
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:21,083
when the world does fall
under your eternal control...

[PICCOLO]
Yes?

279
00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:24,000
Well, I was wondering

280
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:26,791
if you wouldn't mind that
I'd keep, say, half of it?

281
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:32,541
Wait! I, you know, I don't
need that much space.

282
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:34,166
A third of the world
will do me just fine.

he stole the list
to learn of his enemies.

323
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:18,166
I get it! With a
phonebook of his enemies,

324
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:20,125
he can easily track them down.

325
00:22:20,208 --> 00:22:21,666
So he guards
against the wave

326
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:23,541
by killing those who
know how to use it!

327
00:22:23,625 --> 00:22:25,416
[ROSHI]
Exactly!

328
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,291
[ROSHI thinking]
If there was only some way

329
00:22:27,375 --> 00:22:30,500
to warn Goku before
it's too late.

330
00:22:32,458 --> 00:22:33,833
Aha! Gotcha!

331
00:22:40,291 --> 00:22:41,916
[GOKU]
Now you're gonna pay!

332
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,166
[NARRATOR] Will Goku take
revenge for Krillin's death,

333
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:48,916
or suffer the same
fate as his friend?

334
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,458
