00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,708
[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball,

2
00:02:13,791 --> 00:02:17,000
Goku had a brush with stardom
as he fought Pamput,

3
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:19,416
a famous athlete
and action star.

4
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,666
The fourth match of
the quarter-finals,

5
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,208
with its talented contenders,

6
00:02:23,291 --> 00:02:26,333
appeared to have all the
ingredients of a classic fight.

7
00:02:26,416 --> 00:02:29,958
[PAMPUT yells]

8
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:32,375
[NARRATOR] However,
with Goku's first attack,

9
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:36,833
Pamput was immobilized, falling
short of fans' expectations.

10
00:02:36,916 --> 00:02:40,458
Goku's superior fighting skills
not only won him the match,

11
00:02:40,541 --> 00:02:42,500
but hundreds of adoring fans.

12
00:02:42,583 --> 00:02:46,208
Of course, not everyone found
the boy's achievement amusing--

13
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:51,291
namely Tien, who vowed to
destroy Goku in the ring.

14
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:54,083
While Goku and Krillin
rejoiced over the victory,

15
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:57,166
Jackie Chun tempered their
excitement by warning them

16
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:00,583
not to underestimate the
incredible power of Tien...

17
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:03,166
...his next challenger
in the fifth match.

18
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:07,125
The tournament continues, now!

19
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:37,625
[TIEN] Goku's attack on Pamput
was calm and efficient.

20
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:39,833
I would have made
similar choices.

21
00:03:39,916 --> 00:03:43,583
I may have actually found an
opponent worthy of my time.

22
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:50,416
[SHEN]
First things first.

23
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:53,208
Fighting Goku is in the future.

24
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:54,666
You need to focus
on the present,

25
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:57,416
which is your match
against Jackie Chun.

26
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:01,875
[TIEN] You're right, Master.
And Chun is skillful.

27
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:05,541
[TIEN]
Like the perfect predator,

28
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:10,000
he studies his prey, learns
their weakness, then waits...

29
00:04:14,416 --> 00:04:17,333
[TIEN] ...until he finds the
best opportunity to attack.

30
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:30,500
To him there are no obstacles.
Not even his age.

31
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:32,458
[SHEN] For being such
an accomplished warrior,

32
00:04:32,541 --> 00:04:35,125
it's odd that I've never
heard of him before.

33
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:36,916
We know so little about him.

34
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,583
That's what makes
him so dangerous.

35
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:41,208
[TIEN]
Mm.

36
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,166
[CHIAOTZU]
Uh. Look!

37
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,625
[SHEN]
Hm?

38
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:51,541
[TURTLE grunts, gasps]

39
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,250
[exhales deeply]

40
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:58,416
[SHEN] Well, well...
If it isn't Jackie Chun.

41
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:02,583
[chuckles]

42
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:06,125
I have an idea.

43
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:07,333
--[TIEN] Master Shen.
--[SHEN] Hm?

44
00:05:07,416 --> 00:05:09,583
Let's test his strength
against Chiaotzu's.

45
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:10,833
[SHEN]
Ah! You mean now?

46
00:05:10,916 --> 00:05:13,083
[TIEN]
Mhmm!

47
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:15,416
[SHEN]
But my ice cream!

48
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:20,458
I could use something to eat.

49
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:22,208
Are you hungry again, already?

50
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:25,333
How is that possible?
We just ate an hour ago.

51
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:27,708
An hour? No wonder I'm hungry.

52
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:30,500
Do you mind telling me where
you keep your spare stomach?

53
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:36,833
Eh, excuse me, but has anyone
seen Master Roshi lately?

54
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:40,125
[CHUN] Hrm!
He lives to aggravate me.

55
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:42,083
Maybe he got lost again.

56
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:43,333
[CHUN]
What do you mean, "again"?

57
00:05:43,416 --> 00:05:45,333
I've never been lost!

58
00:05:45,416 --> 00:05:47,500
It's more likely
he was told to get lost

59
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:49,833
by the countless number of
ladies he's been talking to

60
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:50,666
since he got here!

61
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,291
[laughs]

62
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:55,541
[CHUN] I've been meaning
to do this for a long time.

63
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,500
If he's trying to meet people,
he may be around the shops.

64
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:06,166
You're right. If I were
him, that's where I'd go!

65
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:09,458
[CHUN]
The shops, huh?! Well!

66
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:10,333
[BULMA]
Yeah, the city is crowded

67
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:12,250
with all sorts of people!

68
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:14,916
[CHUN] Oh, boy! You don't
have to tell me twice!

69
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,291
[laughs]

70
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:20,375
I just remembered there's, uh,
something I need to do, okay?!

71
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:24,208
[chuckles nervously]

72
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:26,250
[CHUN]
Oh-ho, yeah!

73
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:32,500
Perfect. This is going
to be easier than I thought.

74
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:49,083
[CHUN humming]

75
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:52,458
Nice hairdo!

Nice pair of shoes!

78

What exactly are you
planning to do, Tien?

79
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:17,500
It's a surprise, Master.
One I think you'll like.

80

[CHIAOTZU]
Mhmm!

85
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:31,916
[CHUN] Nice shop you got here.
You sell ball caps?

86
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,750
Or sing-along tapes?

87
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:35,583
I don't get many
requests for caps.

88
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:38,541
And I'm afraid I just
sold my last two tapes.

but not much excitement.

around here to unwind?
