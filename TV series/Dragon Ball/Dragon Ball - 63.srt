Last time on Dragon Ball...

[TAILOR gasps]

3
00:02:14,833 --> 00:02:18,375
If I were to pay you,
it would make me look weak.

4
00:02:18,458 --> 00:02:20,708
Please, sir, I meant
no disrespect.

5
00:02:20,791 --> 00:02:23,083
I only ask for what is mine.

6
00:02:23,166 --> 00:02:25,833
Yes. You have made that clear.

7
00:02:25,916 --> 00:02:26,958
No-no-no-no-no--!

8
00:02:29,666 --> 00:02:32,958
[TAO]
I believe I made my point.

00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:34,791
[GOKU]
I have the water!

10
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:36,916
[NARRATOR] While Mercenary Tao
prepared to renew

11
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,791
his search for the
missing Dragon Ball,

12
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:42,083
Goku succeeded in winning
the Sacred Water from Korin!

13
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:43,875
Goku drake deep, hoping to find

14
00:02:43,958 --> 00:02:45,625
his strength
instantly increased.

15
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:48,875
But Korin revealed that there
was no magic in the bottle.

16
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:52,083
Goku's powers were increased
by his hard work alone.

17
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:54,833
[GOKU] Thank you,
Master Korin, for everything!

18
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:58,708
[NARRATOR] Goku made
his way down the Tower,

19

completely unaware that
the evil mercenary was already

20
00:03:02,041 --> 00:03:05,041
hurtling through the sky on
his way to the Land of Korin...

21
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:07,666
The infamous villain is
looking for a rematch

22
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:11,291
in which he hopes to claim
Goku's Four-star Ball...

23
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:13,125
...and his life.

[RED groans] Not scissor,
stupid, cigar! Cigar!

32

Oh... yes.

33
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:23,333
I'm truly amazed at how
far you've come in life...

34
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:25,875

wouldn't like to send

39
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:50,375
some of us to help Tao?
I mean, just in case.

40
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:51,708
I'm sure he can handle it.

41
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,625
I need you here for
more pressing matters,

42
00:04:53,708 --> 00:04:55,375
like handing me my cigars!

43
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:56,708
Right.

44
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:21,208
It's been three days already...

45
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:26,166
I wonder if Goku has made it
to the top of the tower yet?

46
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,083
Huh? Wha--?

You-You killed my father!

That's right. I have killed
many things, little heathen.

Now, listen to me
very carefully...

56
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:17,541
Where are you hiding
the Dragon Ball?

57
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:21,875
It's not here!

58
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:24,833
Speak up, savage,
I can't understand you.

59
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:28,416
The orange shiny ball.
You have it. Where is it?

60
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:33,833
If you want the pain
to stop, talk.

I can't breathe.

62
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:39,416
If you won't cooperate,

63
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,875
then we have nothing
further to discuss.

Ah! You are alive!

00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:05,916
Thank you, Goku!

Everything's going to be
okay now. Don't worry.

I've never fought someone twice.

[UPA]
How was your trip?

75
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:17,875
Did you get to the
top of the tower?

76
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:20,000
Did you drink the sacred water?

77
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:20,833
Yep.

78
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:22,958
And I'm a lot stronger now!

00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:24,958
Wonderful!

Upa, I want you to stay
on the Nimbus, okay?

82
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:38,750
Okay.

Don't you ever
hurt my friend again.

You've no idea how lucky
you are to be alive,

86
00:07:54,666 --> 00:07:56,375
much less talking.

87

No one has ever
survived my Dodon Ray.

Kings and peasants alike
have fallen to its power.

My grandpa protected me.

90
00:08:03,791 --> 00:08:06,708
It was his Four-Star Ball
that was under my clothes.

91

Ah, yes.

92
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:09,666
The missing Dragon Ball,
which I carelessly forgot

93
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,875
to relieve you of during
our last encounter.

94
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:13,750
I won't make that mistake again.

95
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:16,583
I must say, I've been
looking forward to this moment.

96
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:18,750
Though I don't know which
will be more entertaining,

97
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:20,416
taking the Dragon Ball from you,

98
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,750
or ramming it down your throat.

There is a very thin line

between bravery
and stupidity, child.

102
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,958
You don't really think
you'll win, do you?

103
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:36,708
I'll give you one last chance.

104
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:39,416
Give me my Dragon Balls
or I'll take them back.

105
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:43,541
[TAO laughs] What a vivid
imagination you possess.

106

Yes... I see...

It's only been three days
and yet your strength

has increased immeasurably.

I spent my time practicing
for this fight...

121
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:36,583
Those days at the top of
Korin's Tower helped a lot.

122

The sacred Tower of Korin?

123
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:43,541
You climbed to
the top? Impossible.

124
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:46,541
Oh, and I suppose while there,
you drank the Sacred Water,

125
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:47,625
didn't you, huh?

126
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:50,125
It took a while,
but I finally did it.

127
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:51,833
[TAO thinking]
So it is true.

128
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:54,583
I thought it was just
superstition, legend.

129
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:57,041
But that would explain
the boy's increased strength.

130
00:09:57,125 --> 00:09:58,833
I'll be--

131
00:09:58,916 --> 00:10:01,750
No matter. I will
still destroy him.

132
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:05,208
I'm glad you found a way
to amuse yourself

133
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:06,708
with the time you had left,

134
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:09,291
though it won't
make any difference.

135
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:10,791

I don't fight. I annihilate.

you hurt people.

such a small mouth.

Whatever you learned
atop that tower

won't be near enough
to save your hide.

We'll see.

Hey, break time.
It's afternoon tea.

180
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:22,625
Ah, thank you Launch.

181
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:25,041
Krillin, you care
to wet your whistle?

182
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:26,666
Yes...

183
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:31,166
Bulma, would you like some tea?

184
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:33,833
You've been working on this
non-stop since last night.

185
00:13:33,916 --> 00:13:37,291
[ROSHI] Hm. What do you
call that thing anyway?

186
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:40,375
Hm. See, it's a
scouting plane for Goku.

187
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:41,916
I'm almost finished.

188
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,291
A scouting plane?

189
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:45,291
For Goku?

190
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:47,666
Yes. I've even
included a multi-task

191
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,583
processing chip so
it can track him down

192
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:51,250
and record whatever
it is he's doing.

193
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:52,875
How's it gonna
track him down?

194
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:55,000
We don't even know
where to start looking.

195
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:57,833
This machine can cover
a lot of ground, really fast.

196
00:13:57,916 --> 00:14:00,125
And I've enhanced it with
a brand new Dragon Radar.

197
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:02,083
The Radar will get
a fix on his position

198
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:04,208
and then all we have to do
is send the scouting plane

199
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:06,333
out to him!

200
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:09,916
Wow! You're a whiz,
Bulma. That's great!

201
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,625
[BULMA giggles] Well, I've still
got some tweaking to do.

202
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:15,708
But it should work.

203
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:17,916
You've made some
pretty big improvements,

204
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,500
that's for sure.

205
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:22,458
Heh. You've got talent, kid, and
it's filling out very nicely.

206
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:24,333
[BULMA]
Ugh! Dirty old man!

207
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:29,000
The only machine of mine
you've ever shown

208
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:32,333
interest in is this Microband.
For obvious reasons!

209
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:37,958
You pervert.

210
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:39,958
You really ought to be
ashamed of yourself!

211
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:44,041
Bulma, why are you
so mad at Master Roshi?

212
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:46,750
[BULMA] Oh come on! You mean
you never figured it out?!

213
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:48,583
When this was his,
he kept pestering you

214
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:50,291
to take a bath because
all he wanted--

215

Look! It's Goku!

No! The Dragon Balls
are mine, not yours.

he were my equal.
