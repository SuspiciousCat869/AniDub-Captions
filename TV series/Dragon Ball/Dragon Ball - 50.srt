1
00:02:13,541 --> 00:02:16,041
[NARRATOR]
Last time, on Dragon Ball!

2
00:02:16,125 --> 00:02:18,333
[BULMA]
Come on, Krillin, step on it!

3
00:02:18,416 --> 00:02:20,166
They're gaining on us!

4
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,916
I really hate back seat drivers.

5
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,916
[NARRATOR] Goku, Bulma,
and Krillin embarked on

6
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,125
a deep sea adventure to
hunt down another Dragon Ball.

7
00:02:28,208 --> 00:02:30,708
But General Blue and his men
were tailing the trio

8
00:02:30,791 --> 00:02:34,083
in order to take the prize
for the Red Ribbon Army...

9
00:02:35,208 --> 00:02:36,791
[ALL yell]

10
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:40,791
[NARRATOR] General Blue
put the squeeze on our heroes

11
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:43,250
in a high-speed
underwater chase!

12
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:45,791
But a close scrape
against the cave wall

13
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:48,750
left Goku and his friends
free and clear.

14
00:02:48,833 --> 00:02:51,041
At least, for the moment.

15
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:57,291
Uh, wow! What happened
to all the water?

16
00:02:57,375 --> 00:03:00,291
[NARRATOR] The three emerged
inside a mysterious cavern,

17
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:03,083
but so did the Red Ribbon Army!

18
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:04,750
General! It looks like
those pesky kids

19
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:06,583
are trying
to make a run for it.

20
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,416
Get them and quickly!

21
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,000
[NARRATOR] Goku, Bulma,
and Krillin gave General Blue

22
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:19,416
and his forces the slip in the
dark recesses of the cavern,

23
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,208
until Goku made
a startling discovery!

24
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:23,541
Yaaaahhahahah!

25
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:25,083
[screams]

26
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,583
Sounds frightening...
Soldier, check it out.

27
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:33,083
Yes, sir.

28
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:38,875
[NARRATOR] After he
recovered from the shock,

29
00:03:38,958 --> 00:03:41,666
Krillin quickly realized
that Goku's practical joke

30
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:44,250
could actually be
the find of a lifetime!

31
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:46,000
The mark of the pirate.

32
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:48,958
This must be the place
Master Roshi was talking about.

33
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:51,666
The Pirate's
sunken treasure. It's here!

34
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:54,500
[NARRATOR] Unfortunately,
Krillin isn't the only one

35
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:56,541
with treasure on his mind.

36
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:59,750
[BLUE] Supreme Commander Red
will be most pleased.

37
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:14,166
I can't believe we found
the pirate's secret hideout!

38
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,000
I'm gonna find
tons and tons of treasure,

39
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:18,916
and I'm gonna be so rich!

40
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,250
You sure are in a good mood.

41
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:23,166
Don't tell me you've forgot
those army guys

42
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,666
are still after us!

43
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,625
I'd rather find
a room full of food

44
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:29,291
than one full of gold!

45
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:30,791
[KRILLIN] Ooh, I wish
I had bigger pockets!

46
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:33,250
Or a wagon!
Or even better, a wheelbarrow!

47
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:52,291
[SOLDIER] Commander!

48
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:53,875
Hm?

49
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:59,000
[SOLDIER whispers]

50
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:01,791
What do you mean
"pirate's treasure"?

51
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:04,583
Please,
I need you to stay still!

52
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:06,416
[RED grunts]

53
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,875
[SOLDIER] Sir, it has been
reported by General Blue

54
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:11,375
that in his pursuit of
the boy and his companions

55
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:13,833
he may also have discovered
a secret cave in which

56
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:17,083
pirates have hidden a large
stash of gold and jewels.

57
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:20,125
Hmmm. Well, is that right?

58
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:22,083
Sir, please don't move!

59
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:23,916
[grunts]

60
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,916
The pirates' loot
and the Dragon Balls?

61
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,625
General Blue must be
trying to make amends

62
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:29,000
for his past mistakes.

63
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:31,833
He was to blame for
the failure at the boy's base.

64
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:33,375
[STAFF OFFICER]
I have my doubts about him.

65
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,500
With his dismal record,
I'll be surprised if he can

66
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:37,750
pull off something this big.

67
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:40,291
Well, increasing our
rewards, that's fine,

68
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:43,375
but bringing back the Dragon
Balls, that's essential.

69
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:45,916
Make sure General Blue
understands that this is

70
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,083
his last chance to prove
his worth to this army!

71
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:50,541
Yes sir!

72
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,625
Oh, yes, I think that's it!

73
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:05,000
You're done with the portrait?
Let me see it!

74
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:07,458
[PAINTER] Uh, yes, right away.

75
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:12,750
[RED]
Hm. It's genius, genius!

76
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:15,541
You've captured my
commanding presence perfectly!

77
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:18,833
Now I see why you're called the
greatest painter of your time!

78
00:06:18,916 --> 00:06:21,666
Thank you. Thank you very much.

79
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,208
Yes, he has portrayed very well

80
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:26,125
your great dignity
and imposing masculinity.

81
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:30,583
Mhm!

82
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:32,625
[grunts]

83
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:36,583
I've told you before, never
just stand directly beside me!

84
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:38,250
I'm sorry, sir.

85
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:41,500
Treas-ure, treas-ure!

86
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:46,666
How much longer
do we have to walk

87
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,916
to get to the end
of this tunnel?

88
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:51,916
I'm gettin' hungry!

89
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:06,458
[laughs] This cave will make
an absolutely perfect grave

90
00:07:06,541 --> 00:07:08,458
for those three little pests.

91
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:13,958
We're gettin' close!

92
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,333
[KRILLIN] Ooh!

93
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:20,000
[GOKU and BULMA] Aah...

94
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:22,875
[KRILLIN] Hey, the path
gets much smoother here!

95
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:28,791
Why would a bunch
of pirates want to

96
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:31,791
decorate their walls
and floor with polka dots?

97
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:33,625
Who knows?
They can cover the walls

98
00:07:33,708 --> 00:07:37,125
with the funny papers
for all I care. Come on.

99
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:43,791
Whoa!

100
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:46,083
I thought those dots
seemed kinda weird!

101
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:49,250
[whimpers]

102
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:51,791
What was that all about?

103
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:53,416
It must be
some kind of booby trap

104
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,833
to protect the treasure.

105
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:56,958
See, those spears shoot out
of the holes in the wall

106
00:07:57,041 --> 00:08:00,583
if an intruder
steps on one of the spots.

107
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:02,458
It's a good thing
you're so short!

108
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:06,208
Hey, you're no
giant yourself, buddy!

109
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:07,708
How are we
supposed to get through here

110
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:10,083
without coming out
like Swiss cheese?

111
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:11,708
[whimpers]

112
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:13,875
And those army creeps
are still after us!

113
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:16,041
What are we supposed to do?

114
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:18,541
Hmmm. We'll be okay
if we don't touch those

115
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:22,125
round things
on the floor, won't we?

116
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:24,541
What are you talking about?
They're all over the place!

117
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:26,083
How are we supposed to
get through here

118
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:27,416
[BULMA]
without stepping on them?

119
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,166
Huh? Look at them!

120
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,625
We'll just jump!

121
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,791
Huh?

122
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:36,375
Here I go!

123
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:50,666
Amazing!
That's more than fifty feet!

124
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:54,041
[GOKU] Okay Krillin,
it's your turn!

125
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:57,583
[KRILLIN] I see! No problem!
I can do that!

126
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:01,208
No, don't try it, Krillin!

127
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:04,166
You'll be skewered!
Goku's not a normal kid!

128
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,791
Don't worry,
it's no sweat for us.

129
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:10,666
I trained with
Master Roshi too, you know.

130
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,666
It'll be a piece of cake!

131
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:17,083
[yells]

132
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:22,833
[laughs, yells]

133
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
[GOKU] Uh, are you okay?

134
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,041
That sure was close!

135
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:40,791
[GOKU] You jumped too high!

136
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:45,666
[GOKU]
Okay, Bulma! You try it now!

137
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,250
[BULMA] Are you guys nuts?!

138
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:50,250
There is no way
I can jump that far!

139
00:09:57,916 --> 00:10:01,125
Huh? General Blue, sir!

140
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:04,250
So, where are they now?

141
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:06,458
Um, well,
it looks like they are

142
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:09,333
just a couple of
steps ahead of us, sir.

143
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:10,750
And?

144
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:12,958
Uh, and we have
been able to determine

145
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:16,291
that the boy and the others
are completely unarmed.

146
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:18,625
Well, well, is that right?

147
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:20,541
They must have left their
submarine in such a hurry

148
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:23,583
that they left their
weapons behind them.

149
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:25,958
I'm certain they were able
to overpower the others

150
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:29,125
because they had
very advanced firepower...

151
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:31,625
but now
without their arsenal...

152
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:34,333
they are nothing more
than a band of brats.

153
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:39,416
[laughing]

154
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,666
Victory is as good as mine!

155
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,666
Here, hold on tight!

156
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:52,625
Goku, you've got to
slow this thing down!

157
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:54,458
I'm going to fall off!

158
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:56,833
You should exercise more.

159
00:10:56,916 --> 00:10:59,041
Retract slower Power Pole!

160
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:02,250
Oh, please be careful!

Are you okay?

00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,833
Don't patronize me!

They've fallen into

Sorry, sir. I guess
we're kinda stuck here.

I see... That makes sense...

The floor is engineered
to attack any trespassers.

194
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:44,458
That's odd...

195
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:47,375
I'd like to know
how those kids got through.

196
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:48,875
[BLUE] And the pirates
must have had some way

197

to get around that trap.

198
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,416
[BLUE] There must be
a secret passage somewhere.

He-he. Looks like I'll just
have to handle you myself.

Little punk, I'll outsmart you.

Uh-oh, it's dark in there.

I hope this isn't another trap!

I wouldn't rule it out...

[GOKU] Look at this place!

262
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:06,958
[BULMA] It's the pirates' port!

263
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:09,750
[KRILLIN] Sure is
a strange location for it!

264
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:12,875
Hm. I know, it's really
strange that something like this

265
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:15,791
is hidden inside a cave.

266
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:18,208
Yeah, it's no wonder
that no one was ever able

267
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:20,250
to find the pirates' base!

268
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:21,625
Oh, yeah, this has gotta be

269
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:22,958
where they
stashed their treasure.

270
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:25,291
It's around here somewhere,
I just know it!

271
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:38,666
[BULMA] Hey, wait a minute!
That huge submarine...

272
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:40,416
If it's in here,
then there must be

273
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,916
another way
in and out of the cave!

274
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,333
Huh? Why is that?

275
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:47,083
They didn't have
capsules in the old days.

276
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:50,333
They couldn't just make the
submarine small and carry it.

277
00:19:50,416 --> 00:19:51,916
So I bet to
travel out to the sea,

278
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,208
they had to go under the port.

279
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:55,916
[KRILLIN] Oh, I get it now.

280
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:01,083
[chuckles]

281
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:03,375
I think I'll just postpone the
unlucky end of these three

282
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:05,250
until they have delivered
the Dragon Ball

283
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:08,041
and the treasure
into my little hands.
