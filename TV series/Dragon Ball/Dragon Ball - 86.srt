Last time, on Dragon Ball...

So long!

4
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,125
[NARRATOR] The 22nd
World Martial Arts Tournament

5
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:33,083
kicked into high gear
as our heroes' demonstrated

6
00:02:33,166 --> 00:02:37,000
impressive skills and strength
during the Elimination Round.

7
00:02:37,083 --> 00:02:39,333
Yamcha made quick work
of his opponent,

8
00:02:39,416 --> 00:02:42,250
while Krillin got from
underfoot of his adversary

9
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:46,375
by staying one step ahead
of the gigantic warrior.

10
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:49,625
[NARRATOR]
Though the fight was intense,

11
00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:52,041
Krillin prevailed,
getting the upper hand

12
00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:56,125
and turning the behemoth
on his ear... literally.

13
00:02:56,208 --> 00:03:01,291
Unfortunately, the toughest
fighters were still to come.

14
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:03,166
Goku had his hands full

15
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:06,416
as he entered a match against
the formidable King Chapa,

16
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,250
a former champion of
the tournament whose infamy

17
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:12,333
still strikes fear in
the hearts of all who know him.

18
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:14,375
Goku doesn't know
who he's dealing with.

19
00:03:14,458 --> 00:03:15,833
So what's the big deal?

20
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:18,291
He's one of the
strongest men alive.

21
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:22,833
[YAMCHA] King Chapa is an
extremely dangerous adversary.

22
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:24,416
The last time
he entered the tournament,

23
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,666
I heard he won without being
touched by a single opponent.

24
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:34,041
Fighters ready, and begin!

25
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:37,958
Don't be afraid, little one.

26
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:40,333

--[YAMCHA] Aah!

329
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:14,583
Wake up!

330
00:20:14,666 --> 00:20:17,125
Number 99 wins by a knockout!

331
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:19,583
He advances
to the Championship.

332
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:23,791
[grunts] You monster!

333
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:25,333
Is he all right?!

334
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:27,750
He sustained severe
injuries and head trauma,

335
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:29,041
but he should live.

336
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:30,541
Poor Nam.

337
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:33,458
[TIEN] That's unfortunate.
I should have hit him harder.

338
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:38,291
[TIEN]
Oh well, no one's perfect.

339
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:41,541
An amateur like that
has no business in the ring.

340
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:43,500
He may live,
but he'll never fight

341
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:45,291
in another tournament again.

342
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:49,541
[growls] Neither will you.

343
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:51,333
[ROSHI] No, Goku.

344
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,166
You hurt my friend!

345
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:55,541
Let me go!

346
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:58,500
[GOKU] Come back here!
[grunting]

347
00:20:58,583 --> 00:21:00,416
Come back!

348
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,291
[TIEN chuckles]

349
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:09,958
[growling]

350
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:17,083
That's great!
I'm impressed, guys!

351
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:18,541
I guess you did
learn a thing or two

352
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:20,291
from Master Roshi, after all.

353
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:23,208
[KRILLIN] Speaking of
Master Roshi... Where is he?

354
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:25,083
I haven't seen him
since it started.

355
00:21:25,166 --> 00:21:28,125
Wherever he is,
I'm sure there's trouble.

356
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:30,166
It's kind of nice.

357
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:32,125
I need a break from
the old man every now and then.

358
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:33,541
[ROSHI]
I'll tell you what you need...

359
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:34,750
[BULMA and PUAR gasp]

360
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:36,166
[ROSHI] A napkin.

361
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:37,958
And for your information,
I've been hiding

362
00:21:38,041 --> 00:21:40,750
amongst the crowd,
watching the Elimination Round.

363
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:42,500
I come here
to see my boys fight,

364
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:43,958
not stuff my face with sweets!

365
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:45,625
So did you like what you saw?

366
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:47,750
[ROSHI]
Mm-hm! From what I witnessed,

367
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:51,041
I'd say all three of you
have improved a great deal.

368
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:54,083
I think we have a strong shot
at winning this title.

369
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:54,750
Thanks.

370
00:21:54,833 --> 00:21:56,000
We'll win, Master.

371
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:58,208
[announcement tune plays]

372
00:21:58,291 --> 00:22:00,458
[ANNOUNCER] The Championship
is about to begin.

373
00:22:00,541 --> 00:22:02,500
Will all competitors
please report

374
00:22:02,583 --> 00:22:04,666
to the temple at this time.

375
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:06,083
[announcement tune plays]

376
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:07,375
[growls]

377
00:22:07,458 --> 00:22:09,500
It's on, guys!

378
00:22:09,583 --> 00:22:11,375
Maybe the rest of you
can find a good place

379
00:22:11,458 --> 00:22:13,375
to catch the action.

380
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:15,500
[OOLONG] With Launch here,
anything is possible.

381
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:17,541
She's good at making room!

382
00:22:18,666 --> 00:22:20,250
Follow me, boys.

383
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:24,083
My friend and I will show you
the best seats in the house!

384
00:22:24,166 --> 00:22:26,083
[ROSHI and KRILLIN
laugh nervously]

385
00:22:26,166 --> 00:22:27,583
All right, people, listen up!

386
00:22:27,666 --> 00:22:29,291
I want this path
cleared out on the double.

387
00:22:29,375 --> 00:22:31,000
Let's go! Move it!

388
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:37,666
[CROWD screaming, yelling]

389
00:22:39,208 --> 00:22:41,875
[gunfire]

390
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:46,083
[NARRATOR] And so the fight
for the Championship has begun.

391
00:22:46,166 --> 00:22:48,958
Not with a whimper, but a bang!

392
00:22:49,041 --> 00:22:51,958
Join us next time
on Dragon Ball!
