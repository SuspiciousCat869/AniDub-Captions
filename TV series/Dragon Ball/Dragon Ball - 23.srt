[NARRATOR]
Today, on Dragon Ball,

3
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:18,791
the World Martial Arts
Tournament continues,

4
00:02:18,875 --> 00:02:21,375
even as the skies
darken overhead...

5
00:02:21,458 --> 00:02:24,875
A storm is brewing, but an
angry sky won't distract

6
00:02:24,958 --> 00:02:27,500
this crowd from the
action on the arena floor!

7
00:02:27,583 --> 00:02:30,166
The next bout of the
Tournament is moments away,

8
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,666
and after the excitement
of the previous matches,

9
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:35,750
none of these hungry spectators
is going to miss it!

10
00:02:36,625 --> 00:02:38,541
[NARRATOR] Krillin
dominated the first match

11
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:41,375
with a come-from-behind
knock out blow!

12
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,625
[NARRATOR] Jacky Chun
also used a strong wind

13
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:47,000
to win his bout!

14
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:50,541
This time Yamcha was the
victim of the sudden gust!

15
00:02:53,416 --> 00:02:55,583
[NARRATOR] Next it was
Nam who was victorious

16
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:59,875
after resisting the feminine
wiles of the alluring Ranfan!

17
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:01,458
[NARRATOR] And now the match

18
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:03,708
to determine the last
semifinalist is about

19
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:06,083
to take place between
Goku and Giran,

20
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:08,208
today on Dragon Ball.

21
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:11,500
Now, let's get the
next match started!

22
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:13,291
Without further ado,

23
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:15,541
let me introduce the
last two quarter-finalists!

24
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:17,000
The winner of
this match will go on

25
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:19,208
to face Nam in the semifinals!

26
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:22,000
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you...

27
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:25,375
Goku and Giran!!

28
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:26,333
Oh yeah,
that's our boy!

29
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:27,333
Do it, Goku!!

30
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:29,500
Giran...? I wonder
who that is...

31
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:30,458
Come on, Goku!

32
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:31,708
You can beat him!

33
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,708
[GIRAN chuckles]

34

35
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:42,583
Oh, good...

36
00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:43,875
He's just a monster.

37
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:45,833
And to think I was worried...

38
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:51,750
Hi everyone...!
My name's Goku!

39
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:53,333
Yeah! Hey!

40
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:55,083
We know your name,
you big ham!

41
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:58,791
[GIRAN snickers]

42
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:01,083
Now, fighters ready?

43
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:12,500
Beeeegin! Hm?

44
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:16,666

[panicked cries]

47
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:27,625
[ANNOUNCER]
So what do you think?

48
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:29,166
[DIRECTOR] Woof...

49
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:30,541
[ANNOUNCER]
Ladies and gentlemen,

50
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:33,500
the Director has not
postponed the fight as of yet!

51
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:36,333
The match is still in progress!

52
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:41,000
[ANNOUNCER] Wait a minute!

53
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:43,041
I have a new ruling
from the Director.

54
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:45,375
The match has been
postponed and will resume

55
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:47,416
when there's a
break in the weather!

56
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:56,000
[ANNOUNCER] Apparently
the fighters didn't hear

57
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:58,000
the announcement over the storm!

58
00:04:58,083 --> 00:05:03,333
Ahem! Goku! Giran!

59
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:06,833
Your match has been
postponed until a later time!

[raining]

61
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:50,875
[YAMCHA] Well, I'm glad
it started raining!

62
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:53,541
I've got a bad feeling
about that Giran guy, Goku!

63
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:55,333
I don't think he deals
from a straight deck!

64
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:57,000
I'd keep my eye on him!

65
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:58,458
[GOKU] Hm? You mean he cheats!

66
00:05:58,541 --> 00:05:59,333
[YAMCHA] Mm, hm!

67
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:00,416
That's what I heard some guys

68
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,833
saying during the
elimination round!

69
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:03,208
Just don't let your guard down!

70
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:05,833
I would expect the
unexpected if I were you!

71
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:07,916
You're real strong!

72
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,333
But it's not always the
strongest one who wins!

73
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,458
Save your breath, buck-o.

74

My kid's taking
that ugly monster down!

Aren't you, kid?!

76
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,500
I'm definitely gonna try!

77
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:20,958
Hey, you know what,
I just realized?!

78
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:22,458
Master Roshi's not here!

79
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:24,416
Where the heck
did he run off to?!

80
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:28,416
For a second I thought
that was him there!

81
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,625
[YAMCHA] Hm? There is a
resemblance, isn't there?!

82
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:34,083
[OOLONG] Yeah!,
they're both old geezers!

No, it's more than that!

It's him alright!

85

Jackie Chun and Master Roshi
are one and the same--

[GIRAN] Hey, got milk?

92
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:17,791
Huh?

93
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:19,166
Milk, fool!

94
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:21,208
Uh?! Milk?! Yes, of course!

95
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:25,041
We've got milk! Coming right up!
Here you go, milk.

[FIGHTER 2] What a whimp...

98

Hey, you guys!

99
00:07:33,208 --> 00:07:34,958
You started without me!

100
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:39,000
[FIGHTER 1] Hm?!

101
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,625
Hey you rhinoceros
or whatever you are!

102
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:43,833
Watch that stupid tail of yours!

103
00:07:43,916 --> 00:07:45,750
[GIRAN] Hmm?

104
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:48,166
Don't act like you
didn't hear me!

105
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:49,416
You creep!

106
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:52,666
Cool your jets!

107
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:55,166
This is one of the guys trying
to fight in the semi-finals!

108
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,791
It's hard to believe
just by looking at him!

109
00:07:57,875 --> 00:07:59,541
That's for sure!

110
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:00,875
Yeah, No kidding!

111
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:04,125
He must have gotten all
the easy guys in the draw!

112
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:05,500
Krillin!

113
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:07,416
Aren't those some of the
guys you used to train with?

114
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,916
Uh, huh!

115
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:11,375
It's a shame that the
tournament has come down

116
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:14,416
to two kids, a guy old enough
to be their grandfather,

117
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,291
a peasant, and a
monster who likes milk!

118
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:19,333
Yeah! This
championship's a sham!

119
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:22,583
I could beat them...! Easy...

120
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:36,875
[FIGHTER 3]
Alright, you big goon!

121
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,041
You're asking for it!

122
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:39,000
[FIGHTER 4]
Watch that tail, guys!

123
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:40,541
It's lightning fast!

124
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:42,208
[FIGHTER 1] There's only one
tail, and there's four of us!

125
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:44,083
I like these odds!

126
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:52,791
[GIRAN] That's pretty good.

127
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:55,708
You know I kinda like you.

128
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:58,000
I think I'm gonna
kill you last...

129
00:08:58,083 --> 00:08:59,791
What?

130
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:01,166
[GIRAN] You! Bartender...

131
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:01,833
Huh?

132
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:02,500
[GIRAN] Fill me up!

133
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:03,625
Pour the milk! Now!

134
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:05,375
Aaaah! Yes, sir!

135
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:09,000
One glass of cold, Vitamin D
milk coming right up!

136
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,666
Did you see that?!

137
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,375
Yeah! He's strong!

138
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:36,791
I know! I get to fight him!

139
00:09:45,583 --> 00:09:47,000
[GIRAN snickers quietly]

140
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:49,041
Knock it off!

141
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:50,666
[GIRAN] Hmm?

142
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,125
I think they
got the message!

143
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:53,958
Now back off! Enough is enough!

144
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:55,500
Who the heck are you?!

145
00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:57,750
Whoa! Yamcha!

146
00:09:58,083 --> 00:10:00,375
[GIRAN] Uh, oh! It's
happening! The rash.

147
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:01,833
Huh?!

148
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:03,416
Oooh! Man, that itches!

149
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,291
This darn rash never fails!
Fake heros!

150
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:08,250
Pretenders!
They make me break out!

151
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:12,291
Ouch! Ooh! Stop it!
Please! You're killing me!

152
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:14,083
Very funny!

153
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:15,250
[GIRAN] Wait! Don't go!

154
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:16,833
[YAMCHA] Hm?

155
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,250
[YAMCHA] Hey!
What's the deal, pal?!

156
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:23,250
My rash is very rare!

157
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:27,000
The only cure is to stomp out
the pretender causing it!

158
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:34,958
[GIRAN] Come here,
mister handsome hero!

159
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:37,916
Take care of the
big bad monster!

160
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:41,333
Hey! What's going on?!

161
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:43,625
<i>We're</i> supposed
to fight in the match!

162
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:46,375
Shut up!
We're busy here, kid!

163
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:00,000

Don't you realize this
is against the rules?!

174
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:32,208
Fighting outside the arena
is a serious infraction

that will get you both kicked
out of the tournament!

stinking rules, gramps!

way to becoming rich!

I was getting myself into...

forfeit if you don't hurry!

What's going on?!

Attention! Goku!

really blame him... Huh?

for making it this far!

00:18:56,541 --> 00:18:59,541
I wasn't sure if you were going
to be able to get to me in time!

326
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:04,166
What?! You've
gotta be kidding...

327
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:06,333
[YAMCHA and KRILLIN]
Alright, Goku! Yeah!

328
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:09,625
Goodness! Your little
friend is very resourceful!

329
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:11,625
[GOKU] Did you miss me?!

330
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:13,500
[ANNOUNCER] The fighters
can't seem to stay out

331
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:14,666
of the ring today, folks!!

332
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,500
Hey! Look! That's
cheating isn't it?

333
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:19,958
Using any kind of outside tool
is against the rules, right?!

334
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:21,333
Look who's talking!

335
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:23,083
What do you call this
stuff you tied me up with?!

336
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:24,666
Isn't that a tool...?!

337
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:27,541
That's not classified
as an outside tool!

338
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:29,000
The Merry-go-round Gum is

339
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:31,208
from inside my body,
so it's fair!

340
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:33,125
[ANNOUNCER]
Ladies and gentlemen,

341
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:34,625
the match has
come under protest!

342
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:37,708
Giran has objected to Goku's
use of the mysterious cloud

343
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:40,791
but the judge has
ruled in Goku's favor!

344
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:41,875
Huh?!

345
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:43,583
The judge has
declared that the cloud

346
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:45,375
was part of the natural
setting of the arena

347
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:47,333
since his feet never
touched the ground!

348
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:50,500
However, Goku is forbidden
to use the cloud again!

349
00:19:50,583 --> 00:19:52,916
Heh! Sounds good!
I can live with that!

350
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:53,875
Uh, oh!!

351
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:55,041
Yeah, the next time he

352
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:56,958
throws Goku out of
the ring, he's done for!

353
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:58,250
[JACKIE CHUN] Mmm!

354
00:19:58,333 --> 00:19:59,750
I'm gonna knock the
living hoo-haa out of you,

355
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:01,833
you little nuisance of a kid!

356
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,041
Time's up!
Just close your eyes,

357
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:13,083
this is only going
to hurt for a second!

358
00:20:14,666 --> 00:20:16,125
Bomb's away!

359
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:26,416
What?! He's gone!

360
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,958
But how?!
This just isn't possible!

361
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:30,208
Where'd he go?!

362
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:31,500
[CROWD] He's right there,
you doe-doe bird!

363
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:32,833
[CROWD] No, not there!

364
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:34,666
Hanging from your arm! There!

365
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:36,958
[GIRAN] Huh?! Mm?!

366
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:38,541
[ANNOUNCER] Unreal!

367
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:42,500
Goku seems to be
hanging by a... by a tail?

368
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:47,208
Yay! My tail
grew back, alright!

369
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:49,583
Oh, no! It's back!

370
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:52,583
After all this time,
it finally grew back!

371
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:54,416
Anyone for a moonlight
stroll tonight?!

372
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:57,041
No. thanks,
I think I'll pass!

373
00:20:58,166 --> 00:21:00,041
Saved by the tail!

374
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:05,291
But, I still can't beat
him with this stuff on me!

375
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:10,416
Fool! That gum
can't be broken!

376
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:41,875
Aaaaaah!

377
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:46,666
Huh?! He did it!!

378
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:51,458
[laughs] Alright!
I'm free! Yay! Wow!

379
00:21:51,541 --> 00:21:55,583
I always feel so much
stronger when I have my tail!

380
00:21:58,291 --> 00:22:00,291
Hmm! I better give
it a quick test run...

381
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:09,958
[GOKU] Yeah!
With a little work it'll

382
00:22:10,041 --> 00:22:11,833
be even better than the old one!

383
00:22:11,916 --> 00:22:15,333
Mmm! Now!
Let's finish this thing!

384
00:22:16,791 --> 00:22:18,916
Wait! I give up!!

385
00:22:21,958 --> 00:22:24,625
[ANNOUNCER] Amazing!
Giran's throwing in the towel!

386
00:22:24,708 --> 00:22:26,291
He's quitting the match!

387
00:22:26,375 --> 00:22:28,958
Which makes Goku the winner!

388
00:22:29,041 --> 00:22:33,791
Goku is going to the
semi-finals! Spectacular!

389
00:22:33,875 --> 00:22:35,208
Whoa! How does he do it?

390
00:22:35,291 --> 00:22:36,791
Man! He's too much!

391
00:22:39,375 --> 00:22:41,416
[NARRATOR] With a lot of
courage and determination--

392
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:44,208
and a little help from
a very special cloud,

393
00:22:44,291 --> 00:22:45,875
Goku has won his match

394
00:22:45,958 --> 00:22:47,833
and advanced to the semi-finals!

395
00:22:47,916 --> 00:22:50,625
Join us next time,
for Dragon Ball!
