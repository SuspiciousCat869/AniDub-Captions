[NARRATOR] Previously
on Dragon Ball,

2
00:02:13,916 --> 00:02:17,041
Yamcha and Tien came to
blows during the first match

3
00:02:17,125 --> 00:02:18,833
of the tournament quarterfinals.

4
00:02:18,916 --> 00:02:22,416
Not even the mightty
Kamehameha Wave could stop Tien,

5
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,166
who deflected
Yamcha's every move.

6
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,375
[NARRATOR] In the end,
Yamcha fell prey

7
00:02:30,458 --> 00:02:32,708
to his opponent's
cunning deceptions

8
00:02:32,791 --> 00:02:34,833
and extraordinary
fighting prowess,

9
00:02:34,916 --> 00:02:37,958
which dealt him
a crushing defeat.

10
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:40,791
[NARRATOR] The second
match saw Man Wolf

11
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:42,750
confronting Jackie Chun.

12
00:02:42,833 --> 00:02:44,000
Right here.

13
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:47,041
Want a bone?

14
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:48,375
[NARRATOR]
The beast soon discovered

15
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:50,250
he was out of his league...

16
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:55,125
[NARRATOR]
...and out of bounds...

17
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:58,833
He lost the match,
but won his freedom.

18
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:04,250
[NARRATOR] Using a little
hypnosis and Krillin's head,

19
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:07,916
Jackie Chun convinced Man Wolf
the destroyed Moon had returned,

20
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,666
reverting him back
to his human form.

21
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:53,250
[BULMA] Hey guys...

22
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:54,583
Huh?

23
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:56,416
What do you say we surprise
Goku and the others

24
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,416
by buying them all lunch?

25
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,625
Good idea.

26
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:04,208
Yeah, I'd love
some lunch... Huh...?

27
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:06,708
Enjoy miss.

28
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:08,125
Vendor!

29
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:08,666
Huh?

30
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,000
Over here!

31
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:13,625
How about bring some of
those meals our way, pal?!

32
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:16,666
[VENDOR A]
I'd be delighted to, sir. Uh?!

33
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,791
Huh...?

34
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:21,208
[OOLONG chuckles]

35
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:23,833
[VENDOR A cries out in fear]

36
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,208
Well, that's rude!

37
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:28,541
We deserve service
just like everyone else!

38
00:04:28,625 --> 00:04:31,291
Huh... You girls would tell me

39
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:33,583
if there was something
on my nose, right?

40
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,875
Sir, we need service.

41
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:41,791
[VENDOR B] Sure... Aaaaa!

42
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:42,916
[OOLONG] Huh?

43
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,416
The service around
here is horrible!

44
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,625
Now, now, what's
with all the long faces?

45
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:51,125
We want food,
but no one will serve us.

46
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:54,041
[SHEN] It's not you.
It's that fellow.

47
00:04:56,875 --> 00:05:00,458
[OOLONG] Ohh...
huh... What is it?

48
00:05:01,416 --> 00:05:03,583
Is that a... mummy?

49
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:04,875
[SHEN] No. He's not that lucky.

50
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:06,958
That poor fool saw his
shot at the title go up

51
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:10,416
in flames during the
elimination round. Literally.

52
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:14,333
Oh dear...
Who could be so cruel?

53
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:17,333
[SHEN chuckles] 

54
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:21,125
[ANNOUNCER] The third
match in the quarterfinals

55
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:22,583
is about to begin.

56
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:25,166
Krillin opposing Chiaotzu.

57
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:26,916
Hey, everyone,
did you hear that?

58
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,208
They said Krillin!

59
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:30,250
Your ears don't
miss a thing, do they?

60
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:31,791
Of course he said Krillin,

61
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:34,708
and he's going to knock the
block of that lousy Chiaotzu!

62
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:37,166
And he'll do it for Yamcha!

63
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:01,708
Hi, Yamcha.

64
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:05,375
[YAMCHA] Puar...

65
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:06,750
Since you're the only one here,

66
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:09,541
I'm guessing it's time
for the third match, right?

67
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:12,125
I hope Krillin's prepared
to take on Chiaotzu.

68
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:14,666
He could be just
as strong as Tien.

69
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,416
You think Krillin
can win, don't you?

70
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:21,000
Yes... He's a strong
and capable fighter...

71
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:27,791
But Shen and his followers
are dangerous... deadly.

72
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:37,833
[YAMCHA] Puar.

73
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:38,916
Yes?

74
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,250
[YAMCHA] Go to Krillin.
Cheer for him.

75
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:41,875
And bring me the
news of the fight,

76
00:06:41,958 --> 00:06:43,041
when there's something to tell.

77
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:44,250
Alright.

78
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:46,541
You'd better go now. Quickly.

79
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:49,083
[PUAR] I'll be back soon. Bye.

80
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:55,250
[YAMCHA sighs]

81
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:57,291
[YAMCHA] Good luck, Krillin.

82
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,458
You're certainly gonna need it.

83

[CROWD cheering]

00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:25,375
Krillin! Good luck!

85
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:27,125
Krillin's number one!

86
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:30,375
This is the third match and a
sequel of sorts to match one,

87
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:33,458
as both Turtle and Crane
houses suit up for a rematch

88
00:07:33,541 --> 00:07:37,416
with Master Roshi's Krillin
fighting Master Shen's Chiaotzu!

89
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,375
Yes, and the outcome
will be the same, too!

90
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:42,791
[chuckles] Beautiful!

91
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:44,208
Krillin's going
to win this time,

92
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:47,666
so you can wipe that
smug smile off your face!

93
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,625
I'm here!

94
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:51,875
Thanks for the warning.
What are those?

95
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:54,500
[OOLONG] They're
pom-poms... Here.

96
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:56,291
They look like bad wigs.

97
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:57,916
What do you want me
to do with them?

98
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,458
You're supposed
to cheer with them.

99
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:01,666
Ya know, make a lot of
noise for the home team!

100
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:02,708
Like this...

101
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:06,791
Go Krillin!
Go Krillin! Go Krillin!

102
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:08,708
Ready? Okay!

103
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:10,333
Shake those pom-poms
left and right!

104
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:12,250
We're gonna help
Krillin win this fight!

105
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:15,291
Go Krillin! Go Krillin! Ah!

106
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:17,166
Krillin is cool!
He's got no hair!

107
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:18,625
But at least
he's wearing clean--

108
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,833
[BULMA] Be quiet!

109

[clacking]

110
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:28,666
Great sound, don't you think?

111
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,333
[OOLONG] Huh?

112
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:41,541
[ROSHI] Hmm...

113
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:44,833
Hey! Good luck, Krillin!

114
00:08:44,916 --> 00:08:46,000
[KRILLIN] Right.

115
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:50,791
[KRILLIN thinking]
What's he looking at?

116
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:52,375
What's he thinking?

117
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:55,250
I should have watched him fight
during the elimination round!

118
00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:06,541
[SHEN chuckles]

119
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:17,291
And now, let the match begin!

Fight! Come on!

121
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:34,083
Despite what you may have heard,

122
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:35,916
fighting requires movement.

123
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,875
[SHEN chuckles]

00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:44,625
Heh?!

125
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:46,458
Wow, that's a neat trick.

126
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:08,333
Krillin, watch out!

127
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,291
He's just hovering up there.

128
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:23,666
I'll bet he saves
a lot on airfare.

[CHIAOTZU gasps]

Go, Krillin!

Huh? That would be...
No, that's my right. Right?

No, left is over, uh--

[KRILLIN] You're done!

Would you cut it out
and get down here!

What are you?
A warrior or a balloon?!

The flying technique:
Pure Hermit Crane...

Nonsense.

You seem to know a lot
about my master, old man.

I assure you folks,
this is not an illusion.

walking on air!

[KRILLIN thinking]
Okay, Krillin, now what?

150
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:38,458
If I jump attack,

151
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:41,375
he could dodge and send
me flying out of bounds!

but I'm not buying it.

That will be your friend if he
stays in the ring much longer.

in the elimination round is--

[frightened gasps]

164
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:35,041
I never would have
suspected that cute kid

165
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:36,583
as being the psychotic type!

166
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:19,166
[CHIAOTZU] Hmm...

167
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:22,625
[SHEN chuckles]

168
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:30,083
Ah!

169
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:32,041
Dodon Ray!

170
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:46,416
Give me a break!
What's he using?

171
00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:49,875
Dodon Ray!

172
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:52,083
You're still standing?

173
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:55,333
[TAO] Dodon Ray!!

174
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:04,583
[GOKU] That's the same
technique Mercenary Tao used!

175
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:14,916
[GOKU] Hmm?

176
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
What did you say?!

177
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:18,666
Who has the same
technique as Chiaotzu?!

178
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,375
[GOKU] Mmm...

179
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:24,541
Dodon...

180
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:26,875
That was the name of the
technique Mercenary Tao

181
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:29,291
was using when I defeated him.

182
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:32,000
If you say you beat Tao,
you're a liar.

183
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:36,000
It's the truth...
Tao killed my friend's father.

184
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:42,625
He was a great man...
When did it happen?

185
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:45,791
Hmm... About three
years ago, I guess.

186
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:11,291
Now it's my turn!

187
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:15,166
I... will crush you!

188
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:20,541
Yah!

189
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:21,791
Ugh...

190
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:32,333
[TAO] I give up. You win.

191
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:33,666
Huh?

192
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:39,250
I admit my defeat.
Pleased forgive me. I'm sorry.

193
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:42,666
I'll never hurt anyone again.

194
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:45,041
[GOKU] Uh...

195
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:49,333
Please let me go.
I-I'm sorry! [sobs]

196
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:51,375
I guess we can let you leave.

197
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:54,791
Accept this apology!

198
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:05,375
Aaaaaugh!

199
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:10,458
[LAUNCH screams]

200
00:16:10,541 --> 00:16:12,375
[CHIAOTZU chuckles]

201
00:16:16,916 --> 00:16:18,583
[TIEN thinking] Tao was one
of the strongest warriors

202
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:19,958
I've ever known.

203
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:21,916
How could this little
twerp have defeated him...?

204
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,125
It's impossible!

205
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:26,250
Do you have a problem?

206
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:28,250
[TIEN growls] Tch!

207
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:32,166
[GOKU] He seemed upset...

208
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:34,375
Was it something I said?

209
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:35,250
Goku...

210
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:36,291
[GOKU] Yes?

211
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:39,083
Did you really kill
Mercenary Tao?

212
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:41,875
Yes, Jackie, I really did...

213
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:44,083
Why does everyone
keep asking me that?

214
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:46,583
It happened just like I said.

215
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:47,750
[ROSHI thinking]
Oh, Goku,

216
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:49,625
for once I wish you
were lying to me.

217
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:51,541
You have no idea
the repercussions

218
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:53,666
of what you are saying...

219
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:54,541
Goku...

220
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:55,666
Huh?

221
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:58,291
The man you say you killed...

222
00:16:58,375 --> 00:17:01,000
...is Master Shen's brother!

223
00:17:01,583 --> 00:17:06,000
I didn't know
Master Shen had a brother.

224
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:07,958
They don't look
anything alike...

225
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:09,958
But then again Master Roshi
looks nothing like

226
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:13,291
his sister Baba,
except for the whiskers.

227
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Krillin, get out!
It's too dangerous!

228
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:34,333
That's right, girl.

229
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:35,958
If you value your friend's life,

230
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:37,541
you'll persuade him
to quit the match

231
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:40,250
before he gets himself killed.

232
00:17:41,916 --> 00:17:43,458
Krillin, give it up!

233
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:45,875
Warriors don't give up
in the middle of the fight!

234
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:49,708
This isn't about quitting.
It's about preservation.

235
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:51,583
He'll win.

236
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:53,250
Aaah!

237
00:17:57,666 --> 00:18:02,833
[grunting, screaming]

238
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:05,375
[LAUNCH sneezes]

239
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:08,250
No!

240
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:12,958
[LAUNCH snarls]

241
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:14,208
Hey cue ball, buck up!

242
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:16,791
Show some backbone, will ya?!

243
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:19,000
[OOLONG thinking]
Things just got worse.

244
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,458
[CHIAOTZU chuckles]

245
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:44,708
Krillin, look out!

246
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:54,291
There's no way
for him to get away!

247
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:56,500
Krillin, you're
almost off the stage!

248
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:06,000
Good move, Krillin!

249
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:08,208
[SHEN growls]

250
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:18,125
[KRILLIN growls]

251
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:21,166
[CHIAOTZU laughs]

252
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:23,416
[KRILLIN thinking] I can't
keep fighting like this...

253
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:26,166
There has to be
a better strategy.

254
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,416
Come on, Krillin, think!

255
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:32,791
[KRILLIN thinking]
Wait a minute...

256
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:35,291
That's it! This has to work!

257
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:38,500
Go!

258
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:42,291
Wait! What--Where did he go?!

259
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:44,125
Left, right?! Oh no!

260
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:45,416
[KRILLIN] Left...
Right... Left... Right...

261
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,666
Right! Left! Left! Right!
Right! Right! Left!

262
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:50,833
Left! Left! Right!
Right! Right! Right! Right!

263
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:52,708
What's he doing?

264
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:55,625
[ROSHI] Hmm?

265
00:19:57,125 --> 00:19:58,750
[SHEN] Hmm...

266
00:19:58,833 --> 00:19:59,791
[CHIAOTZU thinking]
He's confusing me.

267
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:02,041
Which is left?
Which is right?!

268
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:09,958
That should about do it.

269
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:18,791
[CHIAOTZU] Aaaaaah!

270
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:21,916
Payback!

271
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:28,458
Show off!

272
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:31,750
[CHIAOTZU laughs]

273
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:33,083
[TIEN] Move...

274
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:36,125
Master Shen!

275
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:37,875
I have something to tell you.

276
00:20:37,958 --> 00:20:38,708
Can this wait?

277
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:39,958
In case you hadn't noticed,

278
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:41,791
I'm a little busy right now.

279
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:42,958
[BULMA and OOLONG] Huh?

280
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:48,750
[CHIAOTZU laughs]

281
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:52,208
This would be simple if
I could use the Kamehameha Wave.

282
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:53,875
[growls]

283
00:20:53,958 --> 00:20:58,083
Wait, Yamcha mastered it.
If he can do it, so can I!

284
00:20:58,166 --> 00:21:00,583
All I have to do is try.

285
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:03,458
Heh...?!

286
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:05,333
Let's see, all you do
is put your hands together

287
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:09,416
and say Kamehameha! Wow!

288
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:12,416
Let me get this straight.

289
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,333
You're saying that my little
brother, Tao, was killed

290
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:17,875
by one of Master Roshi's
feeble-minded students?!

291
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:19,375
Well, uh, yes, Master,

292
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:22,250
but I, uh, I-I assume
it happened on accident.

293
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:25,041
Someone killing
Tao is no accident.

294
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:26,583
It's impossible...

295
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:30,083
Especially if you're assuming
it was one of Roshi's scum!

296
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:35,833
Chiaotzu, I want you to stop
playing around and finish him!

297
00:21:35,916 --> 00:21:37,000
What's the matter?

298
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:38,750
Is your pupil having
trouble making good

299
00:21:38,833 --> 00:21:40,833
on all the bloated
threats you've made?!

300
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:44,166
Well, at least both of
my boys can still walk.

301
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:46,583
[OOLONG] Sure. But can
they talk at the same time?

302
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:47,916
Oh yeah?!

303
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,416
Why don't you come here
and say that to my face?!

304
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,791
[OOLONG] I just did.

305
00:21:50,875 --> 00:21:53,250
I heard that,
you insolent oinker!

306
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:55,083
I fear defeating
Master Roshi's students

307
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:57,166
will no longer
be enough for Shen.

308
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:58,708
He wants them dead.

309
00:21:58,791 --> 00:22:01,291
Uh... Do you think
he feels that way

310
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:03,750
because I killed his brother?

311
00:22:03,833 --> 00:22:05,208
Yes.

312
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:08,666
Get ready, here comes Dodon!

313
00:22:15,291 --> 00:22:20,333
Ka... Me...

314
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:24,000
Oh no... Krillin, don't do it!

315
00:22:24,083 --> 00:22:26,000
Don't what?

316
00:22:26,083 --> 00:22:27,791
Listen to me! You're not ready!

317
00:22:27,875 --> 00:22:31,083
Do not try the Kamehameha Wave!

318
00:22:31,666 --> 00:22:34,458
[NARRATOR] The battle
of the blasts has begun!

319
00:22:34,541 --> 00:22:37,833
But will Krillin be able to
control the Kamehameha,

320
00:22:37,916 --> 00:22:40,958
or will the fears of his
comrades come true?

321
00:22:41,041 --> 00:22:43,750
And what of Master Shen's
thirst for revenge?

322
00:22:43,833 --> 00:22:47,500
Will it be quenched with the
demise of Master Roshi's pupils?

323
00:22:47,583 --> 00:22:50,750
The tournament just became
a fight for survival.

324
00:22:50,833 --> 00:22:54,750
Find out who wins,
next time on Dragon Ball!
