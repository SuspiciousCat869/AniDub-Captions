in an enchanted land

00:02:14,958 --> 00:02:18,291
that seemed untouched
by the steady march of time,

3
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:21,791
there lived an old master
named Gohan who found

4
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:25,583
a baby boy abandoned in
the wilderness of the region.

5
00:02:25,666 --> 00:02:28,916
The old master raised
the boy as his own child

6
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,375
and marveled as
the youngster grew

7
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:34,333
and became uncommonly strong.

8
00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:37,833
Now the boy,
known as Goku, is on his own,

9
00:02:37,916 --> 00:02:40,708
and has become the sole
guardian of his grandfather's

his Dragon Ball!

But Grandpa
told me about girls.

He told me that
if I ever ran into a girl,

that I should be as polite
as I possibly could.

you think you're doing?!

Huh? Oh...

Maybe it just takes girls

get that monster to do

00:10:21,791 --> 00:10:23,500
what you wanted it to do?

156
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:27,083
That's not a monster, silly.
That's a car.

Oh, so this is a car.

me to be like steel.

00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:46,500
So, does that mean that you're
from one of the big cities?

165
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:48,041
You got it.

166
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:50,000
Wow! Why don't you
come to my house with me

167
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:51,541
and I'll cook you some lunch.

168
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:53,625
[GOKU] You can tell me all
about the city you're from!

169
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:54,458
Come on!

170
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:55,958
Hold on! Just a second!

171
00:10:57,833 --> 00:10:59,000
[BULMA] It looks like
the Dragon Ball

172
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:00,458
is right down the road!

173
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:03,500
Maybe it's at
this little kid's house!

174
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:07,625
[chuckles]

175
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:08,916
I think it's safe to assume

176
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,458
we're having fish for lunch.

177
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:13,041
Well, alright!
So what's on the agenda?

178
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:15,416
Well, we can have
a bite to eat and talk,

179
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,750
then play together.

180
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:18,458
Now look.

181
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:20,208
If you think we're going to
do anything improper,

182
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:21,416
you can forget it!

183
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,791
Improper?
What does that mean?

184
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:26,000
Oh, nevermind.

185
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:27,500
[GIRL chuckles]
I guess Grandpa hasn't

186
00:11:27,583 --> 00:11:29,041
told him about that yet!

187
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:31,958
This kid's so innocent
that he's adorable.

188
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:32,833
[chuckles]

189
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:34,833
Golly. Girls sure are strange!

190
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:36,708
Well anyway, let's go.

191
00:11:36,791 --> 00:11:40,000
[GIRL] Sounds good! I'll
just follow the giant fish.

192
00:11:42,416 --> 00:11:45,041
So, kid.
What's your name anyway?

193
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:47,375
My name is Goku.
G. O. K. U.

194
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:49,041
[chuckles] What's yours?

195
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:52,000
Uh... My name? Mine?

196
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:53,708
Uh huh.

197
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:54,958
Bulma.

198
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:58,208
Hmm? Ha ha. That's funny!

199
00:11:58,291 --> 00:12:00,833
Hey, Goku's not
exactly normal, so there!

200
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:03,666
[GOKU] Yeah, but it's
not as weird as yours!

201
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,250
[chuckles]

202
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:06,416
Hey, you be quiet!

203
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,458
Bulma happens to be
very elegant!

204
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:11,375
It's a lot better than Goku!
That's for sure!

205
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:12,833
Hmph!

206
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:26,583
[BULMA] Wow!
That's a nice little place

207
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:27,875
you've got there, kid!

208
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:30,625
[GOKU] Gee, thanks!
Just wait here one second.

209
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:33,791
Huh?

210
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,041
Listen.

211
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:39,250
What's up?

212
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:41,500
Grandpa's trying
to talk to me.

213
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:44,500
But Goku,
I don't hear anyone ta...

214
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:45,750
[BULMA gasps]

215
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:48,958
Oh my goodness!
It's a Dragon Ball!

216
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:50,458
[BOTH grunt]

217
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:54,416
Hey! Give me
my grandpa back now!

218
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,458
Your grandpa? You mean this?

219
00:12:57,541 --> 00:13:00,083
Yeah! This is the
only thing that my grandpa

220
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:01,833
gave me to remember him by.

221
00:13:01,916 --> 00:13:04,375
Nobody can touch it but me.

222
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:06,250
[GOKU] Look!
Look what it's doing.

223
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:08,916
I think Grandpa's
trying to talk to me.

224
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,791
What do you think he's saying?

225
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:14,166
I hate to do this, but I
don't really have a choice!

226
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:15,208
See!

227
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:17,083
What?!
You've got to be kidding!

228
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:19,541
You've got
two Grandpas! No way!

229
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:23,083
They're not Grandpas.
They're called Dragon Balls.

230
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:24,791
You sure about that?

231
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:26,791
Definitely. I'm positive.

232
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:28,375
Your ball started
glowing because it was

233
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:30,625
reacting to
the two that I have.

234
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:32,875
Look. Put yours down.

235
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:36,125
[GOKU] Well... okay.
But just for a second.

236
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,041
[GOKU] Oh.

237
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:40,500
Pretty cool, huh?

238
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:43,541
Yeah, these gems have the
power to do great things!

239
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:45,875
And not so great!
Let's just say if a bad person

240
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:47,208
got ahold of these balls,

241
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:49,333
he could really
wreak some havoc!

242
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:51,833
Well what do
these things do?

243
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:54,250
Sure you want to know?

244
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,875
Yeah!

245
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:58,583
M'kay...

246
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:03,583
Ah, there it is!

247
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:05,583
[DOG] It's awfully
dark in there, Sire!

248
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:07,541
[EMPEROR] Shut up, Shu!

249
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:13,458
[EMPEROR laughs] Ahh...!

250
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:16,208
Come to Emperor Pilaf,
my precious! Yes!

251
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:18,541
[shrieks]

252
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:22,458
[PILAF] Get off of me
you bone-head! Ewe!

253
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:27,083
[bats chirp]

254
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:30,125
Uh! [clears throat]

255
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:32,625
Well, enough of that.
I'm ready to make my wish!

256
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:33,791
--[WOMAN] Sir?
--[PILAF] What?!

257
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:35,541
I hate to be the one
to break it to you,

258
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:37,500
but you can't make a wish
with just one ball,

259
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:39,333
you have to have
the others as well.

260
00:14:39,416 --> 00:14:40,708
Mm! Huh?!

261
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:42,625
[WOMAN] There are
seven Dragon Balls, Sire!

262
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:44,541
You have to unite
all seven of them

263
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:47,041
before the Dragon will
appear and grant your wish!

264
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:49,416
Hm... More searching.

265
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,416
[WOMAN] But just imagine,
dear Emperor,

266
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,583
that glorious day
when the seven balls are

267
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:55,291
finally brought together!

268
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:58,250
A beautiful burst of
energy will light the sky,

269
00:14:58,333 --> 00:15:00,500
and in a blazing
surge of fiery power,

270
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:02,583
the Eternal Dragon
will rise before you

271
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:05,541
for the sole purpose of
granting you a single wish.

272
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:07,416
Whatever it may be.

273
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:10,291
[PILAF]
Yes! Yes! I can see it!

274
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:11,833
Well, okay!

275
00:15:11,916 --> 00:15:14,833
I guess I can handle
a little more searching.

276
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:16,166
[PILAF]
Any wish I want, huh?

277
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:19,916
Well then, I want to
rule the entire world!

278
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:24,833
[GOKU] Wow! That's amazing!

279
00:15:24,916 --> 00:15:26,666
You can wish for
whatever you want?

280
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:27,916
And it will come true?!

281
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,750
I wonder why
my grandpa didn't tell me

282
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:31,125
about any of this stuff!

283
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:32,625
He may not have
known about it, Goku.

284
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:35,041
Not many people do.

285
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:36,833
The truth is,
you and I are some of

286
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:38,708
the few people in
the world that even know

287
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:41,208
about the Dragon Balls
or the Dragon.

288
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:43,791
Don't get mine
mixed up with yours, okay?

289
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:45,416
Don't worry,
that's impossible.

290
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,375
Each ball has a different
number of stars in it.

291
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:48,833
See. This one has five.

292
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:51,166
Oh, I get it.
Grandpa's ball has four stars.

293
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:52,833
[BULMA]
Now you're catching on!

294
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:54,250
[chuckles]

295
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:56,250
I can't believe that I already
have three of the balls!

296
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:58,166
If I keep this up,
I'll be able to wish for

297
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:00,083
a boyfriend before
the end of the month!

298
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:02,125
This is so exciting!

299
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:03,958
You are going to let me
use your Dragon Ball

300
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:05,458
so I can make
my wish, right?

301
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:06,750
You can forget it!

302
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:09,000
Grandpa gave me this ball
to remember him by.

303
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:10,375
[GOKU] And I'm not
going to hand it over,

304
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:11,875
just because you're a girl.

305
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:13,416
[BULMA] But your
grandpa said to be as

306
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,291
polite as possible to girls.

307
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:16,333
Mm-mmm.

308
00:16:16,416 --> 00:16:17,458
Uh!

309
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:20,500
Hey, I know what.
Look, I'll trade ya.

310
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:21,958
Uh...?

311
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:25,791
You let me have
your Dragon Ball,

312
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:27,875
and I'll let you
have a little peak.

313
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:30,666
What do I care about
seeing your dirty ol' fanny?

314
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:34,041
It is not dirty,
you rude little boy!

315
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:35,750
Well, shoot.
There's got to be a way.

316
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:37,041
The hunt must go on.

317
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:39,125
Hey, I know!
Why don't you come with me?

318
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:41,375
We can be partners.
Whatd'ya say?

319
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:43,041
Oh, go hunt balls?

320
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:44,583
[BULMA] Sure, why not?

321
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:46,875
You would get to see so many
new things and learn so much.

322
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:48,833
Your grandpa would
