I was lifting boulders
when I was five.

Master, do you mean that you've
been training in Martial Arts

65
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,166
since you were a child?

That's right. And I didn't
have it as easy as these boys.

When I was a kid,

we didn't have nice paths
to carry our boulders on.

69
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:56,916
Master Mutaito made
me walk across

the most treacherous

321
00:19:57,416 --> 00:19:58,458
[SHEN]
Haah!

322
00:19:58,541 --> 00:19:59,916
[grunts]

323
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:04,958
Why are you still standing?!

324
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:07,166
[chuckles]

325
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:08,708
Bye!

326
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:11,541
[PUPILS chuckle]

327
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:13,125
[SHEN laughs]

328
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:14,500
[SHEN]
Imbeciles!

329
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:17,375
Did you really think I came
without a backup plan?

330
00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:26,875
Things just went
from bad to worse.

331
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:29,041
I hate to admit it,
but I think Shen's got us!

332
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:31,583
I'm sorry I brought you
into this, Goku!

333
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,291
[MUTAITO] With concentration,
anything is possible.

334
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:47,291
Clear your mind of all
unnecessary thoughts; focus.

335
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:50,166
The rest is up to you.

336
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,083
[GOKU yells]

337
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:55,333
[growls]

338
00:20:56,916 --> 00:20:58,916
Yes! It's working. We did it!

339
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:06,541
I don't believe it!

340
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:08,625
Wow, I wish I could do that.

341
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:12,041
[PUPIL A squeals, whimpers]

342
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:13,625
Who's gonna save you now?!

343
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:15,833
[PUPIL B growls]

344
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:18,458
[PUPIL B gasps]
Master!

345
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:22,791
[GOKU growls]

346
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:24,750
Now I'm really angry!

347
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:26,625
[SHEN whimpers, gasps]

348
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:28,375
You have a choice to make, Shen.

349
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:29,666
Either you leave now,

350
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:31,791
or you start your training
from the beginning.

351
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:36,416
[SHEN whimpers]

352
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:40,000
He's my pupil, so this
is my fault. Forgive me.

353
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:42,583
I think he became
rotten on his own.

354
00:21:42,666 --> 00:21:44,708
That thing you did
with the fire was great,

355
00:21:44,791 --> 00:21:46,958
just like I taught you.
I'm impressed.

356
00:21:47,041 --> 00:21:48,916
You did? You are?

357
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,666
Sure. It's just a shame
Fan-Fan couldn't see it,

358
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,083
if you know what I mean!

359
00:21:53,166 --> 00:21:56,875
I wasn't unconscious the
whole time. I know what I saw.

360
00:21:56,958 --> 00:21:59,666
Oh! I... I'm so glad.

361
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:02,333
--[FAN-FAN giggles]
--[MUTAITO chuckles]

362
00:22:03,791 --> 00:22:06,000
[GOKU] I guess if
I could cut through fire,

363
00:22:06,083 --> 00:22:07,458
water can't be much different.

364
00:22:07,541 --> 00:22:09,666
Uh, right. That's the idea.

365
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:11,916
You can do whatever
you put your mind to.

366
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,541
[GOKU yells, growls]

367
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,500
Why isn't it working?

368
00:22:19,583 --> 00:22:25,750
[GOKU grunting]

369
00:22:25,833 --> 00:22:28,916
[ROSHI] Of course, you could've
just had beginner's luck.

370
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,083
But you keep trying.
It's good... exercise.

371
00:22:32,166 --> 00:22:36,041
It's difficult to tell whether
or not Goku will succeed.

372
00:22:36,125 --> 00:22:38,833
I call this move
the Fly Swatter.

373
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:42,625
[NARRATOR] Traveling through
time seems to have made

374
00:22:42,708 --> 00:22:44,833
Goku stronger... or has it?

375
00:22:44,916 --> 00:22:48,916
Can young Roshi help his future
pupil harness his Spirit Energy?

376
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,708
Or will failure
be his newest lesson?

377
00:22:51,791 --> 00:22:55,208
