00:02:14,041 --> 00:02:16,041
[NARRATOR]
Previously on Dragon Ball:

2
00:02:16,125 --> 00:02:17,791
Goku has a promise to keep,

3
00:02:17,875 --> 00:02:20,250
and that means battling
his way up Muscle Tower

4
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:22,541
to save the
kidnapped village chief.

5
00:02:22,625 --> 00:02:23,791
On the journey upstairs,

6
00:02:23,875 --> 00:02:26,041
he encountered
the menacing Murasaki,

7
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:28,500
who brought in some
outside help to shift the odds

8
00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:30,708
of winning the fight
in his favor.

9
00:02:30,791 --> 00:02:33,250
We are the five
Murasaki brothers!

10
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,541
Now wait a minute!
Let's talk about this, okay?

11
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:49,583
[NARRATOR] But try as they
might, the five purple ninjas

12
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:53,625
were no match for Goku
and his power pole.

13
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:55,750
Boy, you sure like to run a lot.

14
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:58,416
[NARRATOR] Murasaki
retreated to higher ground,

15
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,500
where he could
call on reinforcements.

16
00:03:00,583 --> 00:03:03,333
Now, Goku will have to face
the Red Ribbon Army's

17
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:08,000
most fearsome creation:
the monster, Android Number 8!

18
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:11,250
Wake up! It's your turn!
Destroy the boy!

19
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:12,708
Caught you!

20
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:33,291
[thunder rolling]

21
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:39,250
[thunder crashing]

22
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:41,916
[laughing menacingly]

23
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:15,458
Hey, Number 8,
you want to come out and play?

24
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:20,125
[MURASAKI] How about
a game of kick his can...

25
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:21,666
...to the street!

26
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:26,208
[thunder crashing]

27
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:32,333
Uh-oh, he's giant!

28
00:04:32,416 --> 00:04:35,708
[MURASAKI laughing]

29
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:38,000
Yes, he's massive...

30
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:40,583
And as mean as he is big!

31
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:41,791
Come on now, let's show him

32
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:44,166
how wicked and
terrible you can be.

33
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:50,083
What about these?

34
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:53,333
Huh? Oh, wait, the key...

35
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:58,041
Hang on, I know it's in here.

36
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:00,666
No need.

37
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:15,541
[MURASAKI laughing]

38
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:17,416
Did I mention
he was strong, too?

39
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,750
[neck cracking]

40
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:22,708
Ah, that feels better.

41
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:25,625
All right! Now get started!

42
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:28,000
Take care of this nuisance.

43
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:30,083
[NUMBER 8] I'd rather not.

44
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:31,125
Huh?

45
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:38,000
What was that?

46
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:43,416
You... no, no!
Surely you do not defy me.

47
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:48,458
Yes, excuse me,
but I hate violence.

48
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:55,333
Hey, I don't remember
asking for your opinion.

49
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:58,333
Your job is to spread
mayhem, not philosophy!

50
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:03,625
Well, I just think that what
you are doing here is wrong.

51
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:06,458
I mean, especially
how you're holding

52
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:09,875
the village elder
hostage upstairs.

53
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:12,083
I've had enough of your mutiny!

54
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:15,208
Don't you know the
Red Ribbon Army created you?

55
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:18,750
How dare you refuse
to obey your makers!

56
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:30,541
I'm sorry... I can't do it.

57
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:31,750
[MURASAKI] Wh-What?!

58
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:35,416
You're nothing but a
yellow-bellied coward!

59
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,458
Call me what you want.
I still can't.

60
00:06:41,416 --> 00:06:45,166
Well, now it has
come to this, Android 8.

61
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:48,125
Do you see this remote?

62
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:50,916
We planned for an
incidence just like this.

63
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,958
A surprise was implanted in
your body when you were built.

64
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:57,541
Let's call it
obedience insurance.

65
00:06:57,625 --> 00:07:00,375
All I have to do is
press this big red button

66
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:02,375
one time and then...

67
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:05,375
...Boom!
The bomb inside you goes off!

68
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:10,125
[MURASAKI] So if you don't
want to be blown to smithereens,

69
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:13,291
you will shut your trap
and follow my orders!

70
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:34,000
I can't, no matter
what happens, do harm.

71
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:37,125
You... Y-You ingrate!

72
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:42,875
[WHITE] Thankless hunk of metal!

73
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:49,333
What a disgrace!
A technological failure!

74
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:50,833
[WHITE] Murasaki!

75
00:07:50,916 --> 00:07:53,625
I want you to destroy that
miserable traitor immediately!

76
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:55,625
Yes, General White!

77
00:07:58,166 --> 00:07:59,916
Hey! Back off, you fool!

78
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:06,458
[MURASAKI] You asked for it.
Prepare for your last blast!

79
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:08,083
[GOKU] No! Don't!

80
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:11,333
Well, then, bombs away!

81
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:15,791
Don't you dare!

82
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:17,291
Ready...

83
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:18,333
[MURASAKI] Set...

84
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:22,875
[GOKU] Stop it!

85
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,625
[GOKU] I won't let you!

86
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:45,333
My controller! You destroyed it!

87
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:49,333
And you're next!

88
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:52,708
[MURASAKI yelling]

89
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:02,708
[GOKU] Ha! It serves him right!

90
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:05,208
No... Another defeat...

91
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:08,291
Can't anyone stop him?

92
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:10,833
[GOKU humming]

93
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:14,500
Thank you
for helping me, friend.

94
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:16,625
No problem, but you
coulda knocked him out

95
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:18,750
by yourself, you know.

96
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:21,458
No. That's mean.

97
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:24,958
But wait, they are
the bad guys, aren't they?

98
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:28,583
Wasn't it mean of
them to try to blow you up?

99
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:31,458
I... I'm just...

100
00:09:31,541 --> 00:09:32,500
...scared.

101
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:36,500
Oh. But you look so strong.

102
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:39,833
What's your name?

103
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:43,083
Goku. How about you, mister?

104
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:44,750
What's your name?

105
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:46,916
Oh. My name?

106
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,500
They call me Android Number 8.

107
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:52,833
That's a funny name.

108
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:56,166
How'd ya get that?
Just the weirdest name...

109
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:59,125
Yep. The weirdest one
I've ever heard.

110
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:00,500
Goku...

111
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:04,250
Don't you want
to find the old man?

112
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:06,291
Oh! I almost forgot!

113
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:09,125
[GOKU]
I guess I'd better get moving.

114
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:12,625
Bye! Good luck!

115
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:21,541
Attention all soldiers!
All soldiers!

116
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:24,625
[WHITE] The enemy has overcome
the third floor guards

117
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:27,541
and is now making his way
through floor number four.

118
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:29,708
Be on alert for combat orders.

119
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:34,250
Hey, what is this?

120
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:38,500
[GOKU]
What're all these walls for?

121
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:09,666
[GOKU] Wait, this is a dead end!

122
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:34,916
[GOKU]
This isn't the way out, either.

123
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:44,000
Wha--?!

124
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:46,333
What kind of a
crazy room is this?

125
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:48,583
[yelling]

126
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:55,250
[GOKU]
What was that?

127
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:07,291
[GOKU] I'm just running
around in circles!

128
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:09,541
[yelling]

129
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:22,375
[GOKU]
Whoa!

130
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:30,041
I can't believe I'm
right back where I started!

131
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:48,166
[WHITE] He's exhausted
himself in the labyrinth.

132
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,916
He can't beat
my impossible maze.

133
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,500
[laughing menacingly]

134
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:54,541
Huh?

135
00:12:57,583 --> 00:12:59,416
[WHITE] Where do you
think you're going?

136
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,375
[GOKU] Not again!

137
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:46,625
[distant heavy footsteps]

138
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:53,208
[heavy footsteps]

139
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:55,291
[heavy footsteps continue]

140
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:20,125
Need some help, Goku?

141
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:23,625
Hey! You're here. How come?

142
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:27,208
It seems that you are having
trouble finding the stairs.

143
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:28,791
I will guide you to them.

144
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:30,916
You know the way upstairs?

145
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,708
I saw the floor plan
a long time ago.

146
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:34,791
Follow me.

147
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:38,083
Thanks a lot!
I owe you one!

148
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:41,791
But you've already helped me.

149
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:54,041
I'll bet I
coulda looked for hours

150
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:56,666
and still not
found my way out of here.

151
00:14:58,041 --> 00:15:01,833
I know.
It does seem hopeless.

152
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:03,791
No, it's this way.

153
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:06,250
[GOKU] Oh, right.

154
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:09,500
Hey, Eighter,
is this the fifth floor?

155
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:12,291
No. We are between
the fourth and fifth levels.

156
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:13,458
Oh!

157
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:18,500
Hey, why did you
call me that name, "Eighter"?

158
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:20,958
Oh, that's just a nickname.

159
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:24,333
"Android Number 8"
is sort of a lot to say.

160
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:27,750
Ah, Eighter.

161
00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:30,958
Eighter... Eighter.

162
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:33,541
I like!

163
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:36,416
Eighter... Eighter...
Eighter... Eighter...

164
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,916
He's kind of weird.

165
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:55,625
So... how's that?

166
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:58,458
[FATHER] Okay.
There's nothing to worry about.

167
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:01,583
How long must this go on?

168
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:06,000
Well, until they
find the Dragon Ball.

169
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:14,416
I-I hate to think about it,

170
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,666
but when the ball
is finally recovered,

171
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,666
what'll they do to our village?

172
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:27,625
[GOKU] Okay!
I'll go get your chief now!

173
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:29,375
[GOKU laughing]

174
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:32,041
[GOKU] Don't worry about me!
I'll be fine!

175
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:45,875
--Oh!
--What's up, Eighter?

176
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,666
I hear...

177
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,208
What is it?

178
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:59,083
Soldiers... many soldiers.

179
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:14,041
[yelling]

180
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:15,333
Oh!

181
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:19,708
Are you all right? I'm sorry.

182
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:21,125
Hi there!

183
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:22,541
There's the menace!

184
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:24,791
Hyah!

185
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:28,291
What is it?

186
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,958
Freeze, scoundrel!

187
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:41,458
Are you okay, Goku?

188
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:42,666
I'm here!

189
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,708
I think we should go this way!

190
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:55,791
[GOKU] Oh!
Not again with the dead-ends!

191
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:57,291
That's impossible...

192
00:17:57,375 --> 00:18:01,458
There was no wall before.
I'm sure of it.

193
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:03,458
Let's find another way.

194
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:09,791
[chuckling evilly]

195
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:12,125
There's nowhere to run, cowards!

196
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:23,000
[NUMBER 8] What?

197
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:34,458
What's the matter?

198
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:37,000
Quickly! We should
run back to that hall.

199
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:38,500
The last hall.

200
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:44,875
The fools...
When will they give up?

201
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:02,375
[GOKU]
There's no use! We're trapped!

202
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:05,583
[GOKU] Hey! Eighter!

203
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,208
No, wait!

204
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:18,000
I knew it!

205
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:20,875
Stop it!

206
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:24,750
Hey! We did it!

207
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:26,083
Hurry!

208
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:37,083
We beat it!

209
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:40,083
Yes, we did.

210
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:42,166
[laughing]

211
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:56,750
[NUMBER 8] The fifth level is
on the other side of that wall.

212
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:59,333
[GOKU] Huh?
But... But where's the door?

213
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:01,125
There are only bricks here.

214
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:05,833
[NUMBER 8] There's no
door into the fifth floor.

215
00:20:05,916 --> 00:20:07,625
A secret room is back there.

216
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:10,583
But I don't know anything
about what's inside.

217
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:13,291
Oh...

218
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,333
[NUMBER 8] This is the
sixth floor command room.

219
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:23,125
The old villager is being
held hostage in here.

220
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:24,250
A-ha!

221
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:28,750
Hey! You there!

222
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:30,750
Are you the one in charge?

223
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:34,291
Hand over the village chief now!

224
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:37,625
I'm surprised you made it.

225
00:20:37,708 --> 00:20:40,916
I'm impressed.
You're a fierce rival.

226
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,750
I would like
you to join my army.

227
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:45,291
Blegh! Blegh!

228
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:48,416
No way!
This is a horrible place.

229
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,125
General White, sir.

230
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:52,833
Please put an end
to your evil ways.

231
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:56,500
Ah... The dirty
traitor speaks out.

232
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:59,541
Well, you still have a tongue,
but your guts are gone.

233
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:00,875
[growling]

234
00:21:00,958 --> 00:21:03,000
That's not true.

235
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:06,000
Who brought you to life?
Tell me.

236
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,416
[WHITE] Remind me...

237
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:12,041
Who was it that built you
painstakingly piece by piece?

238
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:14,250
Who gave you this body?

239
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:17,083
Tell me who it was! Tell me!

240
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,916
Sir, it was
you, General White,

241
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
and the Red Ribbon Army.

242
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:27,541
Now is your last chance, Eight.

243
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:29,625
You can still destroy the kid.

244
00:21:29,708 --> 00:21:31,708
For me. For the army.

245
00:21:39,916 --> 00:21:42,416
I just cannot do it.

246
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:45,500
I won't be a part
of your bad deeds.

247
00:21:46,958 --> 00:21:50,750
I beg of you.
The boy is very strong.

248
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:54,458
Please surrender. It's the
only thing that you can do.

249
00:21:57,833 --> 00:21:59,791
I've had it with this guy!

250
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:02,916
It's time to stop being nice!

251
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,250
I think it is you who
should be surrendering.

252
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:07,625
--Huh?
--Huh?

253
00:22:08,916 --> 00:22:10,958
[yelling]

254
00:22:15,291 --> 00:22:17,875
[chuckling]

255
00:22:17,958 --> 00:22:26,333
[GOKU and NUMBER 8 yelling]

256
00:22:26,416 --> 00:22:27,875
[NARRATOR] Uh-oh!

257
00:22:27,958 --> 00:22:31,375
Just as Goku finally managed
reach the top of Muscle Tower,

258
00:22:31,458 --> 00:22:34,083
a tricky trap door has
sent him and his new pal,

259
00:22:34,166 --> 00:22:37,208
Android Number 8,
on their way down again.

260
00:22:37,291 --> 00:22:41,333
But what kind of trouble has
our hero fallen into this time?

261
00:22:41,416 --> 00:22:45,583
Goku and Number 8 confront
the horrors of floor number 5

262
00:22:45,666 --> 00:22:49,291
on the next heart-pounding
episode of Dragon Ball!
