[NARRATOR]
Previously on Dragon Ball,

4
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:17,541
Goku began his
three-year training

5
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:19,458
for the next World Martial
Arts Tournament,

6
00:02:19,541 --> 00:02:21,708
making good on
his pledge to Popo.

7
00:02:21,791 --> 00:02:25,000
[POPO] One cannot
describe sight to the blind.

8

You'll have to
stumble upon it yourself.

9
00:02:27,791 --> 00:02:29,791
[NARRATOR] A pledge that
forced him to undertake

10
00:02:29,875 --> 00:02:31,708
the most rigorous
training of his life.

11
00:02:31,791 --> 00:02:34,166
Goku was more than
happy to pay the price

12
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:35,666
for the revival of his friends.

13
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:39,416
However, the dangerous trials
he faced took their toll.

[GOKU squeals]

[NARRATOR] Popo and the Guardian
of the Earth watched with glee

16
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:52,208
as Goku bravely endured
his electrifying challenge.

17
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:56,416
It seemed as though he had
bested his shocking adversary.

[GOKU groans]
I'll never give up...

20
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:21,125
One way or another,
I'll find a way to move faster

21
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:22,833
than the lightning...

00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,333
What happened?

27
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:43,041
You've been asleep
for three whole days.

28
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:44,500
That long?

29
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:50,791
Everything seems okay, but I...

30
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:53,041
I could have sworn
I was struck by lightning.

31
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:57,000
Yes, yes you were, in fact.
But you recovered quickly.

32
00:03:57,083 --> 00:04:00,041
That's great!

33
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:03,166
That lightning won't hit me
again. I'll beat it this time!

34
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:07,083
Maybe later. But today, we're
going to try something else.

35
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:08,541
No lightning?

36
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:10,250
Come, follow me.

Ohh.

This place again?

40
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:45,125
There is only one way
to guarantee success

41
00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:46,833
against the lightning.

42
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:52,125
You must shed all that you are
and become blank, like the sky.

43
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:57,583
If you want success,
do what I say.

44
00:04:57,666 --> 00:05:01,500
To understand fully, you must
first journey into the woods.

45
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:05,000
I get it! There's someone in
the woods I have to fight!

Is that it, Popo?

I have told you all that I can.

48
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:11,000
You must go into the woods
and see for yourself.

to eat. I'm starving.

able to do any training

I'm here because of a

Popo? What a funny name!

122
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:41,208
[CREPE] No, it's not. Besides,
I know a squirrel named Poppy.

Crepe is right.

124

What a nice squirrel. He doesn't
like nuts, but he loves sugar.

Popo knows Poppy?

No. I doubt it.

127

Ahh. Poppy has issues.

128
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:57,000
He broke a branch and
fell on Palepaw.

Poppy's on a diet,
just like Papa.

130
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:05,583
So you see, it's very doubtful
that Popo knows Poppy,

or Palepaw!

I'll bet Poppy and Palepaw
could defeat him in a fight!

148

Popo's not the one
looking for a fight.

That's what I'm supposed to do!

I'm afraid the
only person around here

who likes to fight is Yaochun.

worthy challenge!

for you, little man,

the reason Popo sent me here.

164
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:19,958
Well, you won't find him alone.

165
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:22,166
I'll take you there
tomorrow when I go fishing.

other in the tournament finals.

Yeah.

178

You guys are acting
like big shots,

but don't forget about me.

[YAMCHA]
But, Master, I don't understand.

182
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:20,958
[KRILLIN] But you've always
trained us for the tournament.

183
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:24,125
It's kinda your job.
Why won't you help us this time?

184
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:26,708
I do appreciate
your predicament,

but in case
you hadn't noticed,

186
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:29,875
I'm a little busy right now.

187
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:32,916
Does anybody have
a socket wrench?

188
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,625
Please, Master.

189
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:36,250
Can't you see we're desperate?

190
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,916
You're the only one here
who can give us guidance.

191
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,333
All right. There is
one thing I can tell you.

192
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:45,875
You boys will never
be a match for Goku

193
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:48,541
unless you change your routine.

194
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:52,208
Look, let me share with
you a little story.

195
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:55,041
It all started when
I was about your age.

196
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:58,958
I was brash and confident,
and I had a full head of hair!

197
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:01,208
I was even better
looking then, than I am now.

198
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:04,583
Anyway, I happened to run into
this lovely nurse named Iola,

199
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:06,875
who it turned out was in the
same book club

200
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:08,458
as my sister's
best friend's cousin.

201
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:09,958
Now that's serendipity.

202
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:11,125
Thank you, Master.

203
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:12,875
I think I can speak
for everyone here

204
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:14,541
when I say that
was most insightful.

205
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:16,666
Uh, yeah.

206
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,458
Thank you.

207
00:15:18,541 --> 00:15:19,208
[ROSHI]
Mm-hmm.

208
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:22,416
That's why I'm here.

209
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,916
What a way to inspire!

[BULMA laughs]

211
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,375
Thank you.

212
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:38,416
Master, how can a young bald
guy ever meet beautiful girls?

213
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:42,291
Well, that skill
just comes naturally.

214
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:47,875

Goodbye! So long!

220
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,250
So, do you go fishing every day?

221
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:23,833
I sure do.

222
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:26,125
I leave home at the same time
and get back at the same time,

223
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:27,375
just like clock work.

224
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:29,208
No change in the last 60 years.

225
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:32,833
Wow! Sixty whole years?
That's a long time.

226
00:16:32,916 --> 00:16:34,708
And a lot of fish!

227

[KARINTO laughs]

228
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:38,291
You've caught fish every
time you've gone out?

229
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:39,625
You better believe it,

230
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:42,083
and not just for my family
but the neighbors, too.

231
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:44,166
Even the bears
hit me up sometimes.

232
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:46,708
If it weren't for me,
the whole forest would starve!

[KARINTO]
You be careful.

238
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:02,833
And I hope you
catch a bunch of fish!

239
00:17:02,916 --> 00:17:05,583
I'd be happy with the
load I caught yesterday.

My name is Goku. I'm looking
for Yaochun. Are you him?

I am.

Good. Will you please
fight with me?

I've been beat by a kid.

260
00:18:57,375 --> 00:19:01,708
But I'm... faster
than lightning.

261

You are strong!

262
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:07,541
Are you serious? Are you
really faster than lightning?

263
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:10,125
Of course not! I just
say that to scare people.

264
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:13,083
Then you're not
the one. Oh well.

265
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:20,291
[GOKU thinking] If Popo didn't
send me here to fight Yaochun,

266
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:22,416
then who am I supposed to meet?

267
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:30,291
[GOKU thinking]
I wonder if there's even

268
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:32,750
a strong warrior around here.

Oh, so we meet again.

271
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:53,041
Hi, Karinto.
When did you get here?

272
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:54,541
Why are you so surprised?

273
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:56,958
This is the same rock
I sit on every morning.

274
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:59,166
But just a little while ago...

275
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:00,791
[KARINTO chuckles]

276
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:03,625
You must have been half asleep.
It doesn't really matter.

277
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:05,083
Care to try your luck?

278
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:08,041
Sure!

279
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:18,083
I've caught fish before,
but only with my bare hands.

280
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:20,041
I've never used a pole.

281
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:21,375
You're holding
the pole too tight.

282
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:24,083
You need to relax those
arms and take it easy.

283
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:25,791
Oh, like this?

284
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:28,208
That's better.
Remain calm like the water.

285
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:31,083
Take in a
deep breath. Now.

286
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:36,041
[KARINTO]
Exhale. Look to the sky.

287
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:37,958
[GOKU]
Huh?

288
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:40,458
[KARINTO]
Isn't it beautiful?

289
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:41,916
Oh, wow.

290
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:50,083
Keep looking up. Feel the
world around you. Concentrate.

291
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:56,000
I see what you mean. Wow!
Everything is so calm and quiet.

292
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:10,750
[KARINTO] What's wrong?
Having trouble keeping focus?

293
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:12,958
Close your eyes.

294
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:19,000
[KARINTO] Remain perfectly still
and concentrate on the sound

295
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:21,000
of the running water.

296
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:23,416
Soon you will feel its rhythm.

297
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:29,375
[KARINTO] The water sets
the pace for the fish.

298
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:33,708
Once you can feel its rhythm,
you will be one with your prey.

299
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:35,291
Don't rush it.

300
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:40,416
Relieve yourself of all anxiety.
The fish can sense your stress.

301
00:21:45,416 --> 00:21:46,916
[KARINTO]
Once you've cleared your mind,

302
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,166
you will sense
the approaching fish

303
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:53,291
before it ever bites
the string. Focus.

304
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:54,750
Pull up!

By the way, did you find
the man you were looking for?

308
00:22:07,166 --> 00:22:10,041
Yes. I did meet up with Yaochun.

309
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:12,625
But you did not find
what you were seeking.

310
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:20,458
[POPO] He still hasn't
learned anything.

311
00:22:20,541 --> 00:22:22,416
I'm not sure I agree.

that had been in short supply
over the last three years.
