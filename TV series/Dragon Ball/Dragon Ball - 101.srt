00:02:11,375 --> 00:02:13,458
[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball...

2
00:02:13,541 --> 00:02:15,333
[TIEN]
I no longer wish to kill you.

3
00:02:15,416 --> 00:02:17,916
When the time comes, avoid it.

4
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,083
Huh?

5
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:22,333
The Tri Beam Cannon?!
Don't Tien, don't!

6
00:02:22,416 --> 00:02:25,250
Tien Shinhan,
you mustn't do this!

7
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:28,375
[NARRATOR] Proving his desire
to win at all costs,

8
00:02:28,458 --> 00:02:31,250
Tien called upon
the Tri Beam Cannon,

9
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:33,708
a lethal technique with
such fierce power,

10
00:02:33,791 --> 00:02:37,833
it not only destroys the target,
but its master as well.

11
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,333
[TIEN]
Tri Beam!

12
00:02:41,416 --> 00:02:43,541
Excitement turned to horror

13
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:47,458
as Tien's Tri Beam Cannon filled
the arena with blinding light.

14
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:51,083
Goku was consumed by
its deadly brilliance.

15
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:21,041

[CROWD gasping]

[ANNOUNCER] Ladies and

21
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:41,666
Everything is under control.

22
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,375
The fight will continue, uh,

23
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:45,333
assuming that we
can find the stage.

24
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:48,125
I was wrong to judge
my wave against this.

25
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:50,416
There's no comparison!

26
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:53,916
Where's... Where's Goku?!

27

[BULMA gasps]

Goku! Goku, where are you?!

00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:08,083
[ROSHI]
Hm... Hm?

30
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:10,291
[OOLONG] I hate to be the
pessimist, but I don't see

31
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,666
how anyone could
have survived that.

32
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:23,291
He's gone!

33
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:28,333
Hold on... He's not dead.
I can sense it.

34
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:31,250
Are you sure? Where?!

35
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,000
Goku is alive.

36
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:38,875
[panting]

37
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:48,500
[CHIAOTZU thinking] Where is he?
If he's not below, that means...

38
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:50,166
He's up!

39
00:05:04,916 --> 00:05:09,583
[CROWD gasping]

40
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:15,000
I was right. It looks
like they both made it!

41
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:18,583
[ANNOUNCER] Yes, yes, it's true!
Both Goku and Tien

42
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:21,583
have survived the
Tri Beam Cannon!

43
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:23,416
[CROWD cheers]

44
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,916
[ANNOUNCER]
It's a miracle Goku had time

45
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,416
to get free of the blast!

46
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:45,583
[laughs]

47
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:47,541
You made it.

48
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:49,083
You must have set a new record

49
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:52,708
for speed-jumping to
evade such destruction.

50
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:54,333
Powerful technique!

51
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:56,625
There's no way I
would've been prepared

52
00:05:56,708 --> 00:05:58,833
to dodge if you
hadn't warned me.

53
00:05:58,916 --> 00:05:59,875
Thank you.

54
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:04,291
[TIEN] Like I said before,
I didn't wanna kill you,

55
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:06,750
just knock you out of bounds.

56
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:10,750
As you plainly see...
I was quite successful.

57
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:18,333
[TIEN] There's no way you'll
win. Nothing to do now but fall.

58
00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:20,791
And, since there's no
longer a stage to land on,

59
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:23,375
whoever touches
down first will lose.

60
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:27,333
It's as simple,
and perfect as that.

61
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:31,416
Lucky for me, I just happen
to know Sky Dancing.

62
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,208
I could stay
up here for hours.

63
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:40,958
Tien's little scheme worked.

64
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:43,375
Then it's over. Goku will lose.

65
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,875
Good work, Tien!

66
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,250
You haven't won yet.
I've still got one option.

67
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:51,625
Huh?

68
00:06:51,708 --> 00:06:53,875
[GOKU growls]

69
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:56,291
With all my energy focused,
there's no telling

70
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:57,500
what I can do!

71
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:58,916
[TIEN gasps]

72
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,750
I think the thin air has
affected your brain.

73
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:04,083
You're defenseless up
here and you know it!

74
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:06,666
That last technique
took a lot out of you.

75
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,708
I guess we're even. Ready?

76
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:10,958
[TIEN gasps]

Ka... me...

78
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:18,125
You're joking! Don't you
ever get tired of that?!

79
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:20,916
Wait a minute! It looks
like Goku is preparing

80
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,416
to use his Kamehameha Wave!

81
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,291
[YAMCHA gasps]

82
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:28,791
You can't be serious...
That's your last effort?

83
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:31,583
The Kamehameha Wave
won't do you any good,

84
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:33,000
not at this altitude!

85
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:38,916
[laughs]

86
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,541
Ha...

87
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:45,291
Bad move, Goku. There's no
guarantee it will work.

88
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:48,833
But, Master, you've always
said Goku is extraordinary.

89
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:51,541
Maybe he can do
something special.

90
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:55,416
No, no. This has nothing
to do with Goku's ability.

91
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:00,125
It's just a simple fact. That
wave is useless against Tien.

92
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:06,458
No... But then...
It's impossible... Goku lost.

93
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:07,916
Me...

94
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,416

Give it up. You're beaten.

the air, but so are you!

--[KRILLIN] Alright!
--[ROSHI] That's it!

106

Goku has used the
Kamehameha Wave

107
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:47,708
to propel himself like a rocket,

108
00:08:47,791 --> 00:08:50,291
directly at Tien Shinhan!

Oh, no!

That was a perfect hit!
I think Tien's unconscious.

112
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:02,291
That means Goku will win.

113
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:05,833
Not so fast... It's not over
until they touch ground.

114
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:13,750
Goku's efforts may
have been in vain.

115
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:15,916
Both opponents are falling fast.

116
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,500
There's no telling which of them

117
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:20,125
is going to hit
the ground first!

118
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:24,000
I must have used all of my
energy on that last wave.

119
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:26,375
I can hardly move a muscle!

[ANNOUNCER] They're both
falling neck-and-neck.

122
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:56,166
At this point, it's too early
to tell who will hit first.

123
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:58,875
Though, Goku seems to
be at a disadvantage.

another Kamehameha Wave.

127
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:17,916
Though barely creating
a spark, it appears

128
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,750
to have slowed his
descent considerably.

both opponents have
finally landed.

In what can only be
described as bad timing,

00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:13,000
Goku lost his advantage when he
collided with a delivery truck,

to the pavement

You've won.

180
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:14,708
I know cheering is a relatively
new response to you,

181
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:17,583
especially since you're
used to hearing screams.

But you'll get through it.

183

Adulation has a funny
way of growing on you.

So, how does it feel
to win-- the right way?

You should be proud of yourself.
I am. But be warned:

This new turn may bring with
it unexpected consequences.

The finale was close.
It's just bad luck, Goku.

If only you hadn't
been hit by that truck.

You can wear mine.

Huh?

208
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:17,041
Goku, listen. I've been
thinking about it

209
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:19,791
and there's something
I want you to have.

210
00:16:23,541 --> 00:16:26,833
[KRILLIN] Tien... That's your
prize money, isn't it?

211
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:31,750
Look, it's no big deal. I just
think you should take half.

212
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:33,666
We both know if you
hadn't hit that truck,

213
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:36,291
you would've won.
You are stronger.

No thanks.
I appreciate the offer,

215
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,666
but I wouldn't know what
to spend it on anyway.

Yeah, but--

Tien, it's true.
Luck helped you win today.

219
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:55,041
But you shouldn't let that
discount your achievement.

220
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:58,625
In fact, luck and
strength go hand-in-hand.

from our fight.

to stay with me,

up with Launch's cooking.

made up his mind, Launch!

Dragon Ball and my Power Pole.

[NARRATOR] What is the identity
of Krillin's killer,

303
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:49,500
and for what purpose
did it attack?
