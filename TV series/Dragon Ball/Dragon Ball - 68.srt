[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball...

2
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,500
Goku was attacked by Red's
former right-hand man.

3
00:02:18,583 --> 00:02:21,208
Armed with his battle-suit,
the dastardly villain

4
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:23,166
hoped to destroy
the young fighter

5
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,958
in his first official task

6
00:02:25,041 --> 00:02:29,708
as the self-appointed new
leader of the Red Ribbon Army.

Hey! Who turned out the lights?!

Can't this thing go
any faster, Yamcha?

12
00:02:59,625 --> 00:03:01,458
Goku does need our help.

13
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:04,458
I can't believe he tried to
fight the Army by himself.

14
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:06,750
If you ask me,
he deserves what he gets!

15

Oolong! You better take
that back right this minute!

Goku by fighting each other!

all play a little game?

Alright then...

Those cowards are

So why are they running
away from their own base?

Maybe they're not leaving.

Maybe they decided
to come after us.

00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:25,541
Everyone stop
arguing and focus.

163
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:27,250
We're here to help Goku.

164
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:29,416
[ROSHI] We have to set aside
our petty differences

165
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,625
and work together as a team.

166
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:34,458
And we need a solid plan.

167
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:36,125
Okay, I'm in.

168
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:38,500
I'm listenin'.

169
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:44,416
[BULMA]
Yamcha, what do you think

170
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,041
our chances are, realistically?

171
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:51,208
Well, let's see what
Master Roshi has to say first.

172
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:53,125
[ROSHI]
Hm...

173
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:56,208
There is one idea
that comes to mind,

174
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:57,916
but it's not easy.
It's very dangerous

175
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,833
and requires precise timing.

176
00:13:59,916 --> 00:14:02,208
Yeah. Think you could
expand on that?

177
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:04,250
Come on, out with it, old man.

178
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:09,708
[ROSHI]
Hm... Mm-hm. Hm...

179
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:14,333
[ROSHI] I think we can
sneak past the guards,

180
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:15,791
but we'll need a distraction.

181
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:18,625
That'll be Bulma, who'll pretend
to be looking for a date

182
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:19,708
Good one!

183
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:21,500
What's wrong with you!

184
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:23,125
I'm not serious.

185
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:24,750
It doesn't seem
right playing games

186
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:26,916
when Goku could be in trouble.

187
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:31,250
Look, maybe one of us should
go in first and scout the area.

188
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:33,541
Okay... but, who?

Yamcha! There's no time!

Thanks, Puar, let's hope
they didn't see it!

206
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:24,541
Master Roshi,
that looks like Goku!

00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:27,958
I don't believe it! It is Goku!

[GOKU] It's not working...
This isn't good.

These things sure do break easy.

210
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,750
I'd better go to Master Roshi's
house and ask Bulma to fix it.

211
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:43,041
The only problem is,
I don't know how to get back.

He looks happy for someone
who's been fighting an army.

I guess we were wrong.

220
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:08,958
Maybe he didn't
fight anyone at all.

221
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:14,291
Is something wrong?

222

Nothing. We just thought
you were dead, that's all.

223
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,458
We heard that you
decided to attack

the entire Red Ribbon Army
all by yourself.

Wow! That's amazing.
How'd you guys know all of that?

This stinks.
He's not even wounded!

You're a smart kid.

I figured you wouldn't do
something as foolish as that.

[GOKU]
Huh?

00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:37,541
But I did attack
the Red Ribbon Army.

Some of them ran away.

That's unbelievable!

you could show me a few tips?

00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:42,125
It was easy
once I got started.

never heard of anyone

[GOKU] See Master,
I'm a lot stronger now.

256
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:17,750
Just like you, I climbed
up Korin's Tower.

257
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:21,458
What?! You made it to
the top? Of Korin's tower?!

258
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:23,000
[GOKU giggles]

259
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:31,875
[GOKU] I heard whoever drank
Master Korin's sacred water

260
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:33,375
would gain increased strength.

261
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:35,333
So, I asked him
if I could have some.

262
00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:36,250
He agreed...

263
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:37,666
[GOKU]
So, it's all right then?

264
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:40,291
[GOKU] ...but only if I could
take it from him first.

265
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:58,458
[GOKU]
It took a while, but I did it!

266
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:05,041
You consumed
Korin's sacred water?

267
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:06,166
Yes!

268
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:09,041
I see... That would
certainly explain

269
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:11,041
your increased strength.

to brag about that.

I thought all you
were interested in

was your grandpa's 4-star ball.

I found Grandpa's ball,
but I need all seven

[GOKU] I felt responsible
for what happened to Bora

since the killer was
really after me.

I would ask the Dragon

to revive his father.

but I think I can fix it.

You'll have to wait till we
get back to Roshi's house.

[YAMCHA]
No kidding! He's a strong boy.

308
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:15,125
[BULMA] Not his strength.
His heart. He genuinely cares.

309
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:18,958
Strong? Yamcha, he's darn
near invincible!

310
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:21,250
You think he's unstoppable?!

311
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:26,083
[ROSHI laughs] I think Goku
has demonstrated abilities

312
00:21:26,166 --> 00:21:29,375
that go far beyond
his years and training.

313
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:30,791
Let's be clear.

314
00:21:30,875 --> 00:21:34,625
He didn't just hurt the
Red Ribbon Army, he crushed it!

315
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:37,791
When one little boy can
cripple a deadly empire,

316
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:40,916
with its superior
firepower and resources,

317
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,833
I not only think the word
invincible applies,

318
00:21:44,916 --> 00:21:47,875
I think he defines it.

319
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:49,958
They're right above me.

320
00:21:52,166 --> 00:21:54,208
[ROSHI] Personally,
I would have tried a more

321
00:21:54,291 --> 00:21:55,458
diplomatic approach.

322
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:58,458
But hey, I can't fly
on a cloud either.

323
00:21:58,541 --> 00:22:02,000
[ROSHI laughs] They'll be
talking about that one

324
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:07,583
for a while. He may very
well be stronger than me.

325
00:22:07,666 --> 00:22:09,625
Hey, Roshi, is this
your subtle way

326
00:22:09,708 --> 00:22:12,041
of informing me that I
need additional training

327
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:14,125
if I plan to beat
Goku at next year's

328
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:15,291
Martial Arts Tournament?

329
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:16,625
Did I say subtle?

330
00:22:16,708 --> 00:22:18,250
[KRILLIN yelps]

331
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:20,208
In that case, I might
as well tag along

332
00:22:20,291 --> 00:22:22,166
and help him find
the last Dragon Ball...

333
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:26,000
Yeah. He deserves the pleasure
of my company, and besides,

334
00:22:26,083 --> 00:22:27,541
maybe some of that
invincibility of his

335
00:22:27,625 --> 00:22:29,708
will eventually rub off on me.

336
00:22:29,791 --> 00:22:32,250
Good idea. I think I'll join ya.

337
00:22:32,333 --> 00:22:34,541
Just one more
Dragon Ball, Upa...

338
00:22:34,625 --> 00:22:38,125
And then you'll have your
father back again. I promise.

339
00:22:39,375 --> 00:22:41,458
[NARRATOR]
As Goku flies off to retrieve

340
00:22:41,541 --> 00:22:44,500
the last Dragon Ball,
one can only imagine

341
00:22:44,583 --> 00:22:47,916
the adventure that awaits
and the danger...

342
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,750
It all becomes a reality,
next time on Dragon Ball!
