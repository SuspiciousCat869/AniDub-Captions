[KRILLIN]
Excuse me, but who's Junior?

13

Well, that would be him.

Tien wasn't the only one

Tao's brother, the Crane Hermit,
decided to show up as well.

21
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:08,625
Tao vowed to destroy Tien
before the tournament's end.

They're like statues.

It's been ten minutes.
Tien can't move.

It's Tao who can't move.

This is going to be
harder than I thought.

You cannot defeat
my brother, Tao,

59
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:42,458
because he's the one who
taught you defensive strategy.

was wasted on a loser like you.
