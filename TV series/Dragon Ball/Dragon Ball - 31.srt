[NARRATOR]
Previously on Dragon Ball...

00:02:15,416 --> 00:02:18,458
I'm coming! Hang on, Grandpa!

3
00:02:23,541 --> 00:02:24,750
Not good...

4
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:25,750
It's a fake!

5
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:27,416
It's just a glass bead!

6
00:02:28,208 --> 00:02:31,666
It's here, soewhere, buried
under all this old crap.

7
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:34,125
Time's up, old man.

00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:38,666
[gunshots]

00:02:41,416 --> 00:02:43,875
[NARRATOR] As the search
below erupts into chaos,

10
00:02:43,958 --> 00:02:45,875
the real Dragon Ball
has taken wing

11
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:48,791
and now soars silently
in the distance.

12
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:50,625
Goku has also taken to the skies

13
00:02:50,708 --> 00:02:54,708
unaware that the Dragon Ball
he chases is actually a fake

14
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:57,500
and unaware that a
dangerous new enemy

15
00:02:57,583 --> 00:02:59,666
is also on the hunt.

16
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:15,250
[KUMA] Sir, the Dragon Ball
in Colonel Silver's sector

17
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:17,750
has begun moving
to the northwest.

18
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:19,791
[RED] Let him
know immediately.

19
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:23,833
[RED chuckles]
It's all falling into place.

20
00:03:23,916 --> 00:03:26,583
My men have located each
of the seven balls.

21
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:27,916
It's only a matter of time

22
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,125
before they retrieve them
and I rule the world!

23
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:36,541
[SILVER] Foolish peasant!

24
00:03:38,541 --> 00:03:42,666
[beeping]

25
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:44,875
[SILVER] Colonel Silver here.

26
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:46,541
[KUMA] Silver, listen up!

27
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:48,750
[KUMA] The Dragon Ball
is moving north-northwest.

28
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:51,500
Begin pursuit at once.

29
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:53,291
I understand.

30
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:55,041
[SILVER]
Soldiers, we're clearing out!

31
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:56,333
[SOLDIERS]
Sir!

32
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,000
[GOKU] I don't get it.

33
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:08,791
They have Grandpa's
Dragon Ball in there,

34
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:12,083
but the radar still says I'm
getting farther away from it.

35
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:15,250
I guess it's broken,
but oh well...

36
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:16,750
I don't need it anymore!

37
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:18,250
I know where to go!

38
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:25,708
[PILAF sobbing]

39
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:28,833
Oh, Sire, you paid a
fortune for this useless thing.

40
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:30,416
Idiot!

41
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,166
You don't need to
remind me of that!

42
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Um, Sire,
according to the radar...

43
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:38,541
the Dragon Ball is
moving away from this ship.

44
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:41,458
Then follow it, fool!

45
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:43,208
What in the...?

46
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:48,208
That's it!

47
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:54,916
You, get lost!

48
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:01,916
Sire!

49
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:05,291
Help me!!

50
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:13,166
I'll help if yo promise to
give me back my grandpa.

51
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,291
Your grandpa?
What about your grandpa?

52
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:16,666
Who knows your grandpa??!!

53
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,583
I mean my
grandpa's Dragon Ball!

54
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:19,750
Give it back!

55
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:21,000
That cheap glass marble?

56
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:22,708
That was an imitation!

57
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:28,750
W-Wait! I give up!

58
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:31,083
It's all yours! You can have it!

59
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:34,875
So help meeeeee!

00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:38,833
[bonk]

61
00:05:38,916 --> 00:05:40,791
Hey you...

62
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:42,041
Hey, snap out of it.
You made a promise.

63
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:49,000
[SHU] Oh, it looks awful.

64
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:50,708
The boss'll be furious.

65
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:52,583
[MAI] I hope we
found all the pieces.

66
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:55,666
How much longer?

67
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,625
Oh, well, I'm sure they'll
find it any minute.

68
00:05:57,708 --> 00:05:59,541
It's around here somewhere,

69
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:01,500
but you know how it is
tryng to say organized.

70
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:04,125
While you're waiting,
how about a nice cup of tea?

71
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:06,250
Here it is!

72
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:08,250
[SHU] As good as new!

73
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:10,375
Yeow!

74
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:12,541
Ah! I see it's restored!

75
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:15,791
Uh, I mean, you found
where it was stored...

76
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:21,041
Hey, it's my grandpa!

77
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:22,375
Oh, no!

78
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:24,875
You have to hold
these things carefully.

79
00:06:24,958 --> 00:06:26,416
Grab it lightly!

80
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,208
Lightly?

81
00:06:28,291 --> 00:06:30,708
Oh, yea, very lightly.

82
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:32,583
[GOKU] I really missed it!

83
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:36,833
Oh... It's cracked!

84
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:39,250
[PILAF] OK!
Thanks for stopping by...

85
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:40,666
Here's your little ball...

86
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,791
Don't be a stranger, now.

87
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:47,333
Now listen you two!

88
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:48,791
Time to get back to business.

89
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:50,458
Find that real one!

90
00:06:50,541 --> 00:06:52,041
Yessir!

91
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:53,833
What was that about?!

92
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:10,416
No! My Dragon Ball!

93
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:17,666
Grandpa!!

94
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:29,750
Got it. Got it. Got it.

95
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:36,458
Uh... How did that happen?

96
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:38,791
[NARRATOR]
Not far away, in the land

97
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,583
where Fire Mountain once stood,

98
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:43,000
the Ox King has
given up his evil ways

99
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:45,291
has made peace
with the villagers.

100
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:46,625
He and his daughter, Chichi,

101
00:07:46,708 --> 00:07:48,291
are honored by the people now,

102
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:51,750
and enjoy life in
this tranquil town.

103
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:59,666
[CHICHI] Oh, where have
you gone, my darling Goku?

104
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:01,666
[CHICHI] I hope he
hasn't forgotten me

105
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,208
after all this time.

106
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:05,916
I'll just die if
I don't see him soon!

107
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:10,416
[OX KING] Chichi!

108
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:13,250
[CHICHI] Hmm? Oh! Hi, Dad.

109
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:16,583
You're just crazy about
that boy, Goku, aren't you?

110
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:19,500
Well, he's kind of... sweet.

111
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:20,875
[OX KING]
You know, the old housekeeper

112
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:22,750
fancies herself
a bit of a psychic.

113
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:24,958
Maybe she can help you find him.

114
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:27,625
Oh! Would she do that?

115
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:34,666
[chanting]

116
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:37,583
Spirit of Fire Mountain,
all powerful.

117
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:40,000
Will you help
this lovesick fool?

118
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:42,041
She can't find her love today.

119
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:45,875
Will you please
point out the way?

120
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:51,708
Ohhh!

121
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:54,000
Tell me! What is it?

122
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:54,958
[HOUSEKEEPER]
He's approaching...

123
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:57,666
Well, when will he be here?

124
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:00,875
[HOUSEKEEPER] Very soon...

125
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,875
Did'ya hear that Chichi?

126
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:05,291
Your Goku is heading
to our village!

127
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:06,416
Oh, boy!

128
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,833
Goku will fall in love with me

129
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:10,250
and we'll be married and
we'll live happily ever after!

130
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:11,458
Married!

131
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:13,208
Aren't you too young
to be getting married?

132
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:16,166
Besides, how well
do you know this boy?

133
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:17,416
Oh, Daddy.

134
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,416
When it's the right time,
you just know it.

135
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,083
Well, then, I've got
a lot of planning to do!

136
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:24,666
[CHICHI] Planning? What for?

137
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,375
Well, only the
very finest wedding

138
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:28,208
will do for the daughter
of the great Ox King.

139
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:29,458
I have to get ready!

140
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:31,208
Oh... my... is this real?

141
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:33,666
Ah hahaha! I'm getting married!

142
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:36,000
[HOUSEKEEPER thinking]
Uh-oh, what just happened here?

143
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:37,125
Good news! Everyone!

144
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:39,583
Good news!
There's gonna be a wedding!

145
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:48,291
[KUMA] The Dragon Ball
is baring towards

146
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:52,125
point B3 moving north-northwest
at a rate of 50 miles an hour.

147
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:54,916
So far, we still have
no visual confirmation.

148
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,166
We'll stay on alert though, sir.

149
00:09:58,208 --> 00:09:58,916
Look here, Colonel.

150
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,791
I think we've found it.

151
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:03,791
It seems to be
ahead to our left.

152
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:13,208
Jackpot, we have a visual.

153
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:26,041
[SILVER] Wh-What? What the...

154
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:29,500
This will make an
excellent wedding feast.

155
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:31,750
Chichi will be so happy!

156
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:38,500
[SOLDIER A] Colonel,
that's the Ox King!

157
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:40,041
[SILVER] I see that...

158
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:43,416
our job just got
considerably harder.

159
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:47,500
Heads up!

160
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:49,250
An unknown aircraft
in the vicinity.

161
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:56,208
Soldier, fly us to cover.

162
00:11:12,583 --> 00:11:14,958
Sire, I'm afraid
we've run into trouble.

163
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:16,541
I think that's the Ox King.

164
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:18,416
I've heard he
is really ruthless.

165
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,750
Nonsense!

166
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:21,625
My rise to power will
not be stopped by some...

167
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:23,125
some... cow-man!

168
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:24,583
Now you find a way
to get down there

169
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:25,833
and bring me that ball

170
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:28,791
or you'll both be crying
for your mommies

171
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:30,833
But Sire, he's a monster.

172
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:32,375
Yesh, he's really scary,

173
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:34,166
and fearless and
strong and evil.

174
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,041
All the villagers
are petrified of him.

175
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:37,166
They used to call him the...

176
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:38,708
the... Devil King!

177
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:42,958
Uh... Devil King you say?

178
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:45,791
Is this the first
you've ever heard of him?

179
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:48,541
Uh, well, of course it isn't...

180
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:53,541
b-but you know how
these stories can be inflated.

181
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:14,875
Welcome, Sir.

182
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:16,208
May I say it is an honor

183
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:18,083
to help prepare your
daughter's wedding.

184
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:20,166
I'm sure she'll be very happy.

185
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:22,666
The entire village is
buzzing about the big party,

186
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,708
and especially the feast!

187
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:25,958
[OX KING] Thank you very much.

188
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:29,250
I'll give the little bride
your blessings.

189
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:33,458
Huh?

190
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:36,916
Sir, what's that over there?

191
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,166
[OX KING] Where?

192
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:45,541
Oh! Is it the guest of honor?

193
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:48,375
Ready! Man your
positions for attack mode.

194
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:50,375
[MAI] Wait a minute, Emperor.

195
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:52,458
Oh, what now, Mai?

196
00:12:52,541 --> 00:12:54,333
[MAI] Take a look at this, Sire.

197
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:58,250
[VILLAGERS cheering]

198
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:01,708
[PILAF] Welcome back
Gokowa? Huh?

199
00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:03,625
[SHU] I think that's Goku, Sire.

200
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:05,500
[PILAF] Don't correct me!

201
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:08,083
[SHU thinking]
Oh, me and my big mouth!

202
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:11,833
[MAI] Wait. Isn't Goku
that kid with the cloud?

203
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,333
I don't get it.

204
00:13:13,416 --> 00:13:15,333
Why does Goku get this
big welcoming when I,

205
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:17,958
the great Emperor, get zilch?

206
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:20,375
They must be expecting Goku.

207
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:29,583
[OX KING] Chichi! Chichi!

208
00:13:29,666 --> 00:13:33,625
Where did you run off to?
Chichi!

209
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:35,750
Did you see
which way that girl went?

210
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:38,208
[HOUSEKEEPER]
Um... I think she went out

211
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:40,416
to pick some flowers
for her bouquet.

212
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,791
My little girl's
picking her bouquet?

213
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:43,875
I don't believe it.

214
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:48,041
Oh, the children
just grow up so fast.

215
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Emperor, the disguise is ready.

216
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:55,708
Oh, Shu-uuu!
Your costume awaits you.

217
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:01,875
[PILAF] Ah-ha! They'll
never be able to tell.

218
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:03,666
[SHU] But what if
they find me out?

219
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,916
I'm a terrible actor.

220
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,166
You quit that snivelling!

221
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:09,833
You see, it is more logical

222
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:11,750
to get the Dragon Ball
the sneaky way than

223
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:16,166
to have to battle this
big ox on his home field!

224
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:17,875
[SHU] But I'm even
bad at charades!

225
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:19,166
And keep your mouth shut!

226
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:22,208
You sound nothing like Goku!

227
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:23,333
[SHU] Whatever you say.

228
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:24,833
If you weren't
the one with the tail,

229
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:27,291
I sure wouldn't trust you
with anything this important.

230
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:29,000
Don't blow it!

231
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,416
[SHU] Yes sir.

232
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:36,791
Ha-ha! Here's the groom-to-be.

[VILLAGERS cheering]

00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:54,291
Welcome to my village,
young man.

235
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:57,291
Chichi's out, but don't worry,
the wedding's all planned.

236
00:14:57,375 --> 00:15:00,125
It's the finest wedding
in the land, right?

237
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:01,875
[cheering]

238
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:04,166
[SHU] W-Wedding?

239
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:07,375
Hey, you're not getting
cold feet are you, son?

240
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:14,916
And who might you two be?

241
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:18,375
Uh... ah... uh...

242
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:20,291
We're his cousins!

243
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:26,791
I gotta find something to eat.

244
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:27,708
[stomach growls]

245
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:29,375
I'm just starving.

246
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:30,916
Huh?

[girl humming]

249
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:59,250
Hey, Chichi!
It's me, Goku!

250
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:10,916
Goku, I can't believe you
came all this way for me!

251
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,291
What are you talking about?

252
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:15,791
I was just picking flowers
for the wedding, see?

253
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:18,500
Oh... I didn't think

254
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:20,833
this day would ever
come, did you?

255
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:23,416
Well, yeah.
Tomorrow always comes.

256
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:27,791
Oh, Goku, you big joker!

257
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:36,666
Ouch! You made me
hurt my head and my tail!

258
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:39,000
Oh, I've got to
be more lady-like.

259
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:40,625
That's okay...

260
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:43,791
You want an apple?

261
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:45,958
Oh! For me?

262
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:48,083
[GOKU] Sure, I have plenty.

263
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:10,708
[SHU]
Emperor, I can't get married!

264
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:12,750
I don't even know her!

265
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:16,375
Moron, nobody said
you have to marry her.

266
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:19,166
[SHU] But this is
Goku's wedding, isn't it?

267
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:20,458
[PILAF] You just keep
pretending until

268
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:24,666
we get the Dragon Ball,
then we'll scram!

269
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:26,583
[SHU] Yes, Sire.

270
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:28,541
Goku, I'm sorry for the waiting.

271
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:30,250
She should be here by now.

[SHU] Oh, it's no hurry.

273

You idiot!

274
00:17:34,666 --> 00:17:35,833
Can't you think on your own!

275
00:17:35,916 --> 00:17:38,666
Tell him you're hungry
so we can find the ball

276
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:40,791
and sneak out before
she gets back!

277
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:42,875
[SHU] Oh... Okay!

278
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:45,916
Wow, I sure am starving

279
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,166
[sighs]

280
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:51,791
Oh, of course, forgive
me for my rudeness.

281
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:53,166
Why don't we eat now

282
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:56,083
and have the big celebration
whenever she gets back?

283
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:59,375
Hey! Bring out the food!

284
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:10,250
Oh, wow. There it is.

285
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:13,000
Yes, Mai. I can almost taste it.

286
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:24,416
Lts have a toast
to the happy couple...

287
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,083
even though the bride
is still missing...

288
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:28,250
May all your days
be very bright,

289
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:29,541
and your battles short!

290
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:30,666
Cheers!

291
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:34,625
[cheering]

292
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:39,791
Goku, you are our special guest.

293
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:42,375
If there's anything you need,
you just let me know.

294
00:18:42,458 --> 00:18:45,625
Okay everybody, let's eat!

295
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:48,625
Hey, tell him you
want the big one.

296
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:50,750
[SHU] But I'm not really hungry.

297
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:53,500
Just do what I say!

298
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:56,458
Now what are you
two whispering about?

299
00:18:56,541 --> 00:18:58,000
Let me in on the secret.

300
00:18:58,083 --> 00:18:59,708
Oh, well,
Goku's just embarrassed,

301
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:01,291
but he told me he
is really hungry

302
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:04,375
and doesn't think this little
bird is enough to fill him up.

303
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:05,291
Of course!

304
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:07,625
The groom needs his strength!

305
00:19:07,708 --> 00:19:09,500
Don't be so shy...

306
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:11,416
we're practically
family already.

307
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,958
Fathers and sons should
tell each other everything.

308
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:17,500
How can I help if you won't
tell me what you want, son?

309
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:26,750
Look a flying pig!

310
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:36,750
Hold on, pigs don't fly.

311
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:52,250
What is this?
Who in the world would want

312
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:55,708
to ruin my sweet
little girl's wedding day?

313
00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:58,458
I'll get the scoundrel
who did this!

314
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:02,791
Let's move it!
I'm afraid it's now or never!

315
00:20:02,875 --> 00:20:04,291
Don't be foolish!

316
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:06,708
This is the best chance to
get the ball that we've had yet!

317
00:20:06,791 --> 00:20:08,041
Shu, come on now,

318
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:10,708
you've got to pull
yourself together, man!

319
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:13,833
[SHU] Oh yes sir,
I'm very hungry.

320
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,791
He's such a Neanderthal!

321
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:40,791
Colonel, do we retreat?

322
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:42,958
No, hold your ground.

323
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:44,958
I'll take care of him.

324
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:55,208
Oh, I can't see!

325
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:57,250
The net!

326
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:07,791
Never tangle with
the Red Ribbon Army!

327
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:09,000
All available men!

328
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:12,291
Get down there
and find that ball!

329
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:20,625
At last... it's all mine!

330
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:22,125
Huh?

331
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,208
[BOTH] Come on,
come on, come on, come on...

332
00:21:34,958 --> 00:21:36,416
Get him!

333
00:21:53,958 --> 00:21:55,625
So I was thinking,

334
00:21:55,708 --> 00:22:00,375
when we get married I want to
have a really big family, okay?

335
00:22:00,458 --> 00:22:02,833
Do you feel the same?

336
00:22:02,916 --> 00:22:04,916
[GOKU]
Huh? I think I fell asleep.

337
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,208
Oh, you're so goofy!

338
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:07,958
Why are you teasing me?

339
00:22:08,041 --> 00:22:11,458
Ouch!

340
00:22:11,541 --> 00:22:13,250
Why do you keep hitting me?

341
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:14,791
Oh... what's that?

342
00:22:20,708 --> 00:22:24,083
Oh! That's coming
from my village!

343
00:22:24,166 --> 00:22:26,125
Uh... uh-oh!

344
00:22:27,666 --> 00:22:29,791
Come to me Flying Nimbus!

345
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:37,041
Hey, come on,
let's check it out.

346
00:22:37,125 --> 00:22:38,416
[CHICHI] Okay.

347
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,125
[NARRATOR] Will the Red Ribbon
Army allow Emperor Pilaf

348
00:22:42,208 --> 00:22:44,333
to escape with the Dragon Ball?

349
00:22:44,416 --> 00:22:46,333
Will Goku and Chichi
get to the village

350
00:22:46,416 --> 00:22:48,791
in time to help
the great Ox King?

351
00:22:48,875 --> 00:22:50,291
Is the wedding still on?

352
00:22:50,375 --> 00:22:53,333
Tune in to our next
adventure to find out!
