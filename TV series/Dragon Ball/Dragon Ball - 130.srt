[NARRATOR] Previously
on Dragon Ball,

4
00:02:16,708 --> 00:02:18,833
Goku began a rigorous
training program

5
00:02:18,916 --> 00:02:22,000
to prepare himself for the next
World Martial Arts Tournament,

6
00:02:22,083 --> 00:02:24,916
and his meeting with
King Piccolo's alter ego,

7
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,583
Goku attempted
to outrun lightning.

8
00:02:27,666 --> 00:02:30,541
The hero rejoiced
over his supposed victory,

9
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:33,916
until the truth
became shockingly clear.

10
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,916
Goku took a more subtle
approach to his problem

11
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,208
by clearing his mind
of all worry

12
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:41,583
and focusing on
the world around him.

13
00:02:41,666 --> 00:02:45,416
Slowly he became attuned to the
rhythm of his environment and,

14
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,375
with help from Master Mutaito,

15
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:50,333
learned his spiritual energy
was a mighty tool,

16
00:02:50,416 --> 00:02:53,041
powerful enough
to cut through fire.

17
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:57,458
[NARRATOR] But his attempt
to cut through water

18
00:02:57,541 --> 00:02:59,291
was unsuccessful,

19
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:02,625
leaving Popo and Kami
in doubt of his potential.

20
00:03:02,708 --> 00:03:05,166
