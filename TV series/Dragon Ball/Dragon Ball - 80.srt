There is one person
I can think of right away.

is your charge

46

that my son stole
your wallet, Dragon.

What is the name
of that trick you used?

144
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:14,750
The Phantom Star Technique.
My dad created it.

145
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:16,458
I never heard of that before.

146
00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:19,083
Like its namesake, the
technique uses an energy

147
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:21,208
to project an image
that doesn't exist.

148
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:22,083
I never knew that.

149

wield the Phantom Star.

Perhaps one day, but not now.

152
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:31,833
Goku has the discipline and
training to use it correctly.

153
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:33,416
I'm not sure what you said,

154
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,083
but it sounds a lot
like my Afterimage--

155
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:37,708
Technique...

156
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:39,125
Not many can use it.

157
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:42,500
That you can shows that
you have extraordinary skill.

158
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:44,041
Goku, I'm sorry.

159
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:47,125
The truth is I have
a very bad condition...

160
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:50,375
I've tried to maintain my health
for the King's Match but...

161
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:52,083
For a king?

162
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:53,583
Yes, sort of.

163
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:56,125
Each year, a fight is held
in the presence of our king...

164
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:57,541
Whoever wins the match

165
00:10:57,625 --> 00:11:00,708
will be bestowed the title of
Master of Martial Arts.

166
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:03,750
I see. Who is your opponent?
Is he strong?

167
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:06,333
[CHIN] Sky Dragon.
You met him in town today.

168
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:07,958
He runs the Panther-Fang school

169
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:10,791
along with his oversized
brother, Rising Dragon.

170
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:13,333
Sky is a gifted fighter and
extremely powerful,

171
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:15,000
but he doesn't like competition.

172
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:17,583
Mine is the only other
martial arts school in town.

173
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:20,416
When it became popular, Sky
nearly ran me out of business

174
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,791
by persuading, threatening
most of my students

175
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:24,833
to join him instead.

176
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:28,125
If I defeat Sky and gain the
title of Master of Martial Arts,

177
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:31,583
there's a good chance I can
revive my Chin-Star School.

178
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:33,250
--[coughs]
--Ah! Father!

179
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:35,416
You need medicine!

180
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,958
Where do you find medicine?

181
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:38,583
I'll go get some
if you think it will help.

182
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:39,875
There's a place in the city--

183
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:40,666
[CHIN] No!

184
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:41,791
Uhh...

185
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:43,666
[CHIN] Rising Dragon
is a vengeful man.

186
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:46,208
If he sees you, there's no
telling what he'll do!

187
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:48,125
I'll be okay. He's just one man.

188
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,791
All the same, I'd rather
avoid any confrontation

189
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:55,333
with the Panther-Fang School...

190
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:55,875
The King doesn't like opponents
fighting before the match.

191
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:56,958
I understand...

192
00:11:57,041 --> 00:11:58,833
If I run into anyone
from the school,

193
00:11:58,916 --> 00:12:00,583
I won't start a fight.

194
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:03,583
Drinks! Bring me more drinks!

195
00:12:03,666 --> 00:12:06,833
[SKY] Calm down, brother.
Drink your soup...

196
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:10,250
Your manners leave much
to be desired. More tea.

197
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:12,000
Yes, right away.

198
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:15,375
Hey! Kid, come here!

199
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:19,958
Watch out! You almost hit me!

200
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:21,500
[DRAGON laughs]

201
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:25,083
Next time I won't miss.
Let's finish what you started.

202
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:27,208
No, I can't fight you.

203
00:12:27,291 --> 00:12:29,041
Suit yourself, thief.

204
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:30,708
Sky, remember that
punching bag

205
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:32,416
you were going to get me
for my birthday?

206
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:36,083
Don't bother. I just found one.
Let me pound him, Brother.

207
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:37,333
Happy birthday.

208
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:38,791
[DRAGON chuckles]

209
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:55,833
Sorry, I don't have
time for this.

210
00:12:55,916 --> 00:12:57,291
I'm in a hurry.

211

Somehow I don't think that's
what my brother had in mind.

222
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:36,875
Try me.

[GOKU] You're fast!

Where's that
carefree laughter now?

226

How pathetic. You're obviously
one of Chin's students.

--That wans't fun.

But at least I kept my promise.

233
00:13:57,458 --> 00:14:00,541
I got Chin's medicine
and I didn't start that fight.

234
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:06,208
He's late. I knew
we couldn't trust him.

235
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:08,000
Hi. I'm back.

236
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:14,208
'Bout time. I was beginning
to worry. What happened?

237
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:16,583
I got the medicine.
I hope it's enough.

[grunting,

[SKY] Who's next?
What's the matter?

00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:29,583
Am I still too great a challenge
for you weaklings?

241
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:31,708
Alright, I won't use
my legs either.

There is no doubt...

Tomorrow, I will destroy Chin
in front of everyone.

[SHOKIN grunts]

249
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:12,833
Sky Dragon isn't so tough.

250

Everyone thinks I'm just a kid,

251

but I know how to
take him down.

[yawns]

[SHOKIN] What are you
saying, father? [CHIN]

257
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:32,833
Sometimes knowing
when not to fight

258
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:36,041
is just as important. I know
it is difficult for you, Son,

259
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:37,666
but please try to understand.

260
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,500
I cannot fight
in this condition.

261
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:41,500
I must therefore
forfeit the match.

262
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:43,916
But the King will declare
Sky Dragon the Master.

263
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,333
I am well aware.

264
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:47,916
If there was anything I could do
to change that, I would.

265
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,666
You can... allow me
to fight in your place.

266

No!

Why don't you have
faith in me, father?

I'm ready. I know
I can beat him.

00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:57,875
My word is final... No!

270
00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:59,416
Please, father, I know--

271
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,833
Shokin! I said no!

00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:01,666
[coughs]

00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,291
I didn't mean to upset you!

00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:05,666
[GOKU] How about me?

275
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:07,458
I'll fight against
Sky Dragon.

276
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:09,083
But Goku--

277
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:12,125
This has nothing to do with you,
so just stay out of it, okay?!

278
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:14,041
Look, I'm not trying
to interfere,

279
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:16,916
but I have experience fighting.
That's why I'm here.

280
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,125
Sky Dragon is a
deadly adversary.

281
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:22,125
I appreciate your concern,
but I wouldn't volunteer

282
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:23,750
if I didn't think I could win.

283
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:25,333
Besides, I'm in training
to compete

284
00:16:25,416 --> 00:16:27,250
against the world's
toughest fighters...

285
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:29,583
I'll win.

286
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:31,291
Very well.

287
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:32,291
[GOKU] Thank you.

288
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:34,083
He's no bigger than me.

289
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:37,083
Sky is a devious fighter
who will do anything to win.

290
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:39,125
He has never lost a match.

291
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:40,625
I understand.

292
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,625
[SHOKIN] How can you trust a
stranger over your own son?!

293
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:44,833
If anyone's going to
replace you, it should be me!

294
00:16:44,916 --> 00:16:46,875
I will not debate
with you, Shokin...

295
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:50,250
Your arrogance blinds you
to Goku's superior strength.

296

Where do you think
you're going?

297

To fix breakfast. I think
I have enough skill to do that.

Start the match!

328
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:26,125
And now, the competitor
from both schools

329
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:28,500
will enter the arena
at this time!

330
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:30,791
[SHOKIN thinking] Oh no!

331
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:34,833
From the Panther-Fang
School, Sky Dragon!

[CROWD cheers]

333

Sky Dragon!
You're the champ!

334
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:41,750
Representing the
Chin-Star School, Goku!

335
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:43,041
What?! Who?

336
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:48,125
Hello, Mr. Dragon. Good luck.

337
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:49,458
Nonsense!

338
00:18:49,541 --> 00:18:52,000
I signed up to fight Chin,
not some upstart brat!

339
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:55,916
According to rule sixty-three,
sub-paragraph thirty-seven A,

340
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,333
each team is allowed
one representative

341
00:18:57,416 --> 00:18:58,583
of their choosing.

342
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:00,750
Either fight this boy
or forfeit the match.

343
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:03,166
[SKY] Very well...
But I do so under protest.

344
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:05,791
Let Chin hide
behind the rulebook!

345
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:07,375
The dispute is settled.

346
00:19:07,458 --> 00:19:09,708
The match will continue until
one contestant either gives up

347
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:11,083
or loses consciousness...

348
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:11,958
Begin!

I didn't think Goku
could move that fast.

00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:26,500
He does have some skill.

Something's wrong
with my stomach.

I don't feel good.

is much I must atone for.

I can start over.
