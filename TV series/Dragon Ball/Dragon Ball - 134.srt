00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:20,000
[NARRATOR] Three years
have passed since Goku

00:02:20,083 --> 00:02:22,125
and his friends
parted company to embark

7
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:23,708
on their separate training.

8
00:02:23,791 --> 00:02:27,958
The cheerful reunion didn't
last long as a storm blew in.

00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,833
King Piccolo's
alter ego, Junior.

12
00:02:40,916 --> 00:02:43,833
His arrival offered
little surprise to Goku,

13
00:02:43,916 --> 00:02:46,416
who agreed to face
Piccolo's offsrping

14
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,083
in exchange for the
resurrection of his friends,

15
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:52,500
Krillin, Chiaotzu,
and Master Roshi.

16

Uh! Goku, is it possible...

00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:35,333
...one of Piccolo's
henchmen survived?

26
00:04:35,416 --> 00:04:38,000
Yeah, in a manner of speaking.

27
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:40,000
I was afraid of that!

28
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:45,250
I wouldn't tell the others
about this, if I were you.

29
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:47,333
If they found out,
it would just upset them

30
00:04:47,416 --> 00:04:49,041
and start trouble.

31
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:51,291
[KRILLIN]
Goku, who was that guy?

32
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:52,625
Do you know him from somewhere?

33
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:54,791
He seemed to know you.
Was he giving you trouble?

34
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:57,125
Well, uh, we were just
talking about that.

35
00:04:57,208 --> 00:05:00,291
Uh, he looked pretty strong,
didn't he, Tien?

00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:01,958
[TIEN]
Mmm.

00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:07,000
[CHIAOTZU] Tien, that
looked like King Piccolo.

[TIEN]
Don't say anything.

[CHIAOTZU]
Uh, okay.

[KRILLIN, YAMCHA]
Huh?

Come on, Goku. We're your pals.
You can tell us.

60

I don't have a clue! I've never
met her before in my life.

00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:34,125
Stop it! Do you
expect us to believe

62
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:36,625
that she yelled at you
for no reason?

63
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:38,500
I don't know her, honest.

64
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:40,625
Was she a part of your
difficult training?

65
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:43,750
Just what have you been up
to for the past three years?

66
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:48,000
Goku! Training for a tournament
isn't a game, you know!

67
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:52,583
Didn't you learn
the word "discipline"?!

[grumbling]

That girl definitely
knew Goku from somewhere,

wouldn't you agree, Tien?

the preliminary round.

Please gather at
the center of the room.

[COMMISSIONER]
I'd like to thank all of you

for your support of
the Martial Arts Society.

78

As you know, the World
Martial Arts Tournament

79
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:20,333
is held once every three years.

80
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:23,750
This year, the number
of participants is 72,

81
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:27,541
much lower than the record
numbers enjoyed last time.

82
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:31,500
Unfortunately, recent events
have thinned our roster.

83
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,583
I am also aware
that the difficult

84
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:36,708
and dangerous reputation
carried by this event

85
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:40,125
may have scared many
would-be participants away.

86
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:43,708
Therefore, it is safe to say
that the 72 warriors

87
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:47,541
who stand before me
are of the highest caliber.

It doesn't make sense.

show up at the tournament?

00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:56,333

00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,458
by Piccolo's enforcer.

162
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:36,083
King Chapa. Goku has it tough.

163
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:40,458
I have fought the one called
Tambourine and survived.

164
00:12:40,541 --> 00:12:44,125
Hm. Goku...
I have waited a long time

165
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:45,541
to get back in
the ring with you.

166
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:48,000
You and I have some
unfinished business.

167
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:53,708
Long before your lucky victory
during our last encounter,

168
00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:57,125
I was champion
of this tournament.

169
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:59,375
Now I will have my revenge.

170
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,833
Did you get your
complimentary T-shirt?

171
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:37,000
You can have it
embroidered for five zeni.

172
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:40,416
I don't ever wear shirts.
They chafe my skin.

173
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,250
Well, you're missing out.

174
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:44,333
Yeah, well they used
to give away posters.

175
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:48,416
I got mine signed by Chapa
the year he was champion.

176
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:52,375
I will reclaim the title.
You don't stand a chance, Goku.

177
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:57,666
Ready! You may now begin!

178
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:10,291
[CHAPA groans]

00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:11,958
[yells]

180
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:15,333
I have developed
a few new moves, Goku.

181
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:17,666
Just for this occasion.

182
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:30,958
[CHAPA groans]

183
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:35,083
It that your defense?
You fool.

184
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:38,375
Are you so weak that
you won't even try to fight?

185
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:50,416
[CHAPA grunts]

186
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:07,875
[OOLONG] I don't get it.
Why is he just standing there?

187
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:10,000
[YAMCHA]
Don't worry. He's okay.

188
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:12,375
I can't sense anything from him.

189
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:15,250
His mind is completely cleared.

190
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:19,708
If King Chapa doesn't realize
it, he won't stand a chance.

191
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:23,250
Focus... Win.

192

Where has he gone?

196
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:52,458
Stop hiding!

197
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:55,791
Do you hear me, you coward?!

198

Uhhh...

00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:13,166
Number 3 has fainted.
Number 2 is the winner!

[CROWD cheering]

203
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:16,500
[MAN]
Incredible!

204
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:18,708
I'm glad I got to see it
from the front row!

205
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:22,500
That's fantastic! Puar,
let's go tell the others!

206
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,083
I have a feeling we haven't
begun to see Goku's power.

207
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:28,125
Yes.

208
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:30,500
Look. He doesn't even blink.

209
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:36,916
[CROWD cheering]

210
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,541
[JUNIOR] How easily
the crowd is entertained.

211
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:42,708
Goku hasn't begun to
unleash his full power.

212
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:43,750
[scoffs]

213
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:45,833
However, with moves
that elementary,

214
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:47,833
he hardly stands a chance.

215
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:50,708
I'll rip him into pieces
in front of his friends.

216
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:52,750
[chuckles]

217
00:16:54,916 --> 00:16:56,541
Thank you.

218
00:16:57,958 --> 00:17:01,625
Hm? Really? Sounds like
Goku has improved.

219
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:03,416
He had Chapa going...

220
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,291
[grunting]

221
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:06,875
He went down fast!

222
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:10,875
I'm not surprised. Goku's hard
training is starting to pay off.

223
00:17:10,958 --> 00:17:12,750
Yamcha's been training
just as hard.

224
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:15,166
They all have.
I wonder how it's going?

225
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:17,333
[OOLONG] Time to
sprout wings again.

Is he okay?

How could this
have happened? Chiaotzu!

242
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:43,625
Wake up.

[MAN chuckles]

244
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:51,000
I didn't kill him,
though he should have died.

00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:54,250
However, I didn't
want to be expelled.

00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:56,375
You will pay for this!

247

Aah!

248
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:03,833
We meet again, Shinhan.

249
00:19:03,916 --> 00:19:06,541
No! You're dead!

250
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:11,541
Not quite.
And you must be Goku.

251
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:15,208
Uh. That's right. How do you
know my name? Who are you?

Aah!

00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:31,333

That's right.
Like my new look?

00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:42,416
But... Mercenary Tao died.
How is this possible?

257
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,875
[TAO] With a good imagination
and a lot of zeni.

258
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:48,250
There is life after death,
but it's not cheap.

259
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:51,250
It took a while for me
to get my parts in order,

I'm sorry, but you'll
have to leave the stage.

You seem to enjoy your life.

if I had to take it away.

Stay!

270
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:16,875
Goku, a little
background would help.

271
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:18,916
He's Mercenary Tao, a killer.

272
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,416
Killer?

273
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:23,625
He's also the younger brother
of Shen, the Crane Hermit.

[gasps]

And if I understand
their order correctly,

276
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:29,750
that makes him Tien
and Chiaotzu's superior.

277

How do you know this guy?

278
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:35,416
He tried to kill my
friends and I stopped him.

00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,875
There was a big explosion,
and then he was gone.

284
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:09,083
That's right. And little
Goku was responsible

285
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:11,291
for that big explosion.

286
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:15,708
After that, you could say
my entire life fell to pieces.

287

What now?

288
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:19,916
That's up to Goku.

289
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,500
I'm here to fight, but it's
not the title I'm after.

290
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:24,916
[GOKU]
Then what do you want?

291
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,333
Revenge. An eye for an eye,
if you get my meaning.

292
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:32,291
I can take your life now,
or crush you in the ring.

293
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:35,666
After that, I will deal
with you, Tien Shinhan.

294
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:40,083
Once my brother's star pupil,
now a--what's the word?

295
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:42,791
Mmm. A traitor.

296
00:21:42,875 --> 00:21:47,083
I did not betray Master Shen.
I was loyal to his house.

297
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:50,375
Until...

298
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:54,500
I discovered I did not
share his ideals.

299

[TAO chuckles]

300
00:21:59,208 --> 00:22:02,666
Your fate has been sealed.

301
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:08,916
Then so be it. I will
fight you for Chiaotzu.

302
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,416
[laughing]

303
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:16,625
You haven't changed.
You still have a big mouth.

304
00:22:16,708 --> 00:22:18,916
I'll gladly shut it.

305
00:22:30,125 --> 00:22:31,666
[NARRATOR]
Mercenary Tao, the world's

306
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:35,416
most notorious assassin,
has returned from the grave

307
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,125
to seek revenge.

308
00:22:37,208 --> 00:22:40,500
His mechanical sights are
set on Goku and his friends.

309
00:22:40,583 --> 00:22:43,833
Will they find the strength
to thwart this lethal menace?

310
00:22:43,916 --> 00:22:47,250
He's already defeated
Chiaotzu! Who's next?

311
00:22:47,333 --> 00:22:49,666
There's only one way
to find out.

action-packed episode
