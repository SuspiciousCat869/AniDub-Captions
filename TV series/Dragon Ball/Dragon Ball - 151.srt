00:02:11,458 --> 00:02:13,666
[NARRATOR]
Previously on Dragon Ball...

2
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:16,291
Goku and ChiChi
were taken by surprise

3
00:02:16,375 --> 00:02:19,125
when her father's castle
went up in flames.

4
00:02:19,208 --> 00:02:21,500
In a desperate attempt
to save his kingdom,

5
00:02:21,583 --> 00:02:25,291
the Ox King sent Goku to
find the magical Bansho fan.

6
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:28,166
Fortuneteller Baba revealed
the instrument's location

7
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,750
was linked to an octagon
and pointed the pair

8
00:02:30,833 --> 00:02:34,875
to a remote island, home of a
magical bird called Fire-Eater.

9
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:37,666
What they found was an egg.

10
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:42,791
The Fire-Eater
caught the attention

11
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:44,416
of another interested party:

12
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:48,833
none other than the King
of Schemes, Emperor Pilaf.

13
00:02:48,916 --> 00:02:52,166
His plan to sell the egg
for profit was smashed

14
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:55,333
when its owner made
a surprise return.

15
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:57,541
Goku and ChiChi were
stunned to learn

16
00:02:57,625 --> 00:02:59,125
the bird could not help them,

17
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:03,625
but watched in awe as its
offspring successfully hatched.

18
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:06,833
Both mother and chick
escaped the fiery volcano

19
00:03:06,916 --> 00:03:09,750
and set out for
their new life together.

20
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:12,166
Meanwhile, Goku headed north

21
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:15,500
as his search for
the Bansho fan continued.

22
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:51,208
What a gorgeous mountain!

23
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:52,791
The way that old man
was talking,

24
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:55,750
I thought we were
headed for trouble.

25
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:02,791
[gasps]

26
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:12,333

What's going on? Goku!

[WOMAN]
Oh... Oh... Oh.

34
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:40,250
[BOTH shivering]

35
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:43,625
It's... cold!

36
00:04:43,708 --> 00:04:46,041
Who... are you?

37
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:48,916
My-My name is Go-ku!

38
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,875
Chi... Chi.

39
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:55,416
Fine. My friends
call me Octagon.

40
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,083
Oh. You look more oval to me.

41
00:04:58,166 --> 00:05:01,708
Uh, did you say Octagon?
Baba's clue!

42
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:04,541
Yeah. That means the
Bansho fan must be here.

43
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:06,041
Oh!

44
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:07,625
We found it!

45
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:08,416
Yes!

46
00:05:10,791 --> 00:05:12,500
[OCTAGON]
Foreigners.

47
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:19,291
[OCTAGON]
I assume the two of you

48
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:22,083
tried to climb
Mt. Frappe together?

49
00:05:23,375 --> 00:05:26,583
[GOKU] That's right.
Why, did we do something wrong?

50
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:29,666
If you took that girl with you,
you certainly did.

51
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:32,166
Women have been forbidden
to climb Mt. Frappe

52
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:34,083
since before I can remember.

53
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:34,958
[CHICHI]
Huh?

54
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:36,708
I don't understand.

55
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:38,166
[growls]

56
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:41,541
If a female gets near that
mountain, things turn ugly.

57
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:42,916
Oh?

58
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,041
You mean that horrible
snowstorm was because of me?

59
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:46,750
I provoked the mountain?

60
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:48,416
[OCTAGON]
Mhm-hmm.

61
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,208
[CHICHI sighs]

62
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:51,833
[OCTAGON]
Why should that bother you?

63
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:54,750
What business do you young
ones have with the mountain?

64
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:57,416
We were told that's where
we might find the Bansho Fan.

65
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,291
Ah?

66
00:05:58,375 --> 00:05:59,791
The Bansho fan?

67
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:02,416
Yes. It can
extinguish any flame.

68
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:06,250
That's a tall claim. A fan?

69
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:08,250
You mean you've
never heard of it?

70
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:11,000
[OCTAGON] Yeah, here's your
word for the day: reality.

71
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:14,583
But how could you not know
about the fan? You're Octagon.

72
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,166
[OCTAGON]
Well...

73
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,750
Since Fortuneteller Baba was so
convinced the Bansho fan was

74
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:22,583
near an octagon, we naturally
assumed that meant you.

75
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:23,500
[laughs]

76
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,333
I said Octopus.

77
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:26,875
[laughs]

78
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:28,375
Sorry, all gums!

79
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:30,000
[GOKU, CHICHI groan]

80
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:34,250
[GOKU] If the fan isn't
on the mountain...

81
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:37,041
[CHICHI]
Where could it be?

82
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:40,541
Hmm. Cheer up. There's more than
one way to put out a fire.

83
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:44,333
It's true. You're not likely
to find a fan on that mountain,

84
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:47,291
but there is something that
will work just as well.

85
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:48,750
[GOKU]
What is it?

86
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:50,458
[CHICHI]
Please, tell us.

87
00:06:50,541 --> 00:06:53,333
The snow on the mountain...

88
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:57,750
[OCTAGON] It is cold enough
to freeze even fire.

89
00:06:57,833 --> 00:06:59,958
It's no fan, but...

90
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:02,041
Snow that can freeze fire?

91
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:05,416
Goku, if we can gather
enough and take it with us...

92
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:09,958
Right! Wait here. It'll
be faster if I go alone.

93
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:12,000
I'll be thinking about you.

94
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:13,250
Oh.

95
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:15,250
Ma'am, do you mind if I
borrow this for a while?

96
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:16,166
Sure.

97
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,541
[CHICHI]

[CHICHI laughing]

103
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:33,000
That young man is
your future husband?

104
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:34,458
Huh?

105
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:37,708
Yes. Isn't he just fabulous?

106
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:40,833
It takes more than...
smiles to make a marriage work.

107
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:45,583
Huh? Oh, I know what you mean.
I need to learn how to cook.

108
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:48,166
[OCTAGON]
Do you want to be a good wife?

109
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:51,208
Well, I certainly don't
wanna be a bad one!

110
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:53,625
[OCTAGON]
Good. Let's get started.

111
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:56,375
I have much to teach you.

Emperor Pilaf,
we are within range.

You may begin your scan
of the mountain.

[PILAF]
Hmm. There's no sign of them.

116
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:20,833
[SHU] What's the big deal
about this Bansho fan, anyway?

117
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:26,708
Given the effort they're
expending to find it,

118
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:31,666
this Bansho fan may be even more
valuable than the Dragon Balls!

119
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,208
That would be great.

120
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:35,166
Every time we go after
the Dragon Balls,

121

Put your backs into it!

The flame, it's frozen!

Woohoo. It works!

00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:34,625
The old lady was right!
We don't need the fan!

155
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:44,041
[OCTAGON] Lesson one: a clean
house makes for a happy home.

156
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:47,083
And you've got a lot of
happiness to clean here!

157
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,416
A cleaner's best
weapon is water.

158
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,416
Go through the woods,
pass two valleys,

159
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,791
and you'll come upon a lake.

160
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:57,416
There you'll find all
the water you need.

161
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,916
There's no water in the house?

162
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,958

[PILAF]
A reunion. I'm so happy!

165
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:09,666
You didn't seem happy
inside the volcano.

166
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,250
Ah?

167
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:15,083
You didn't catch me at my best.
But here, I'm in my element.

168
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:19,333
Now, give me the Bansho fan!
Mai, Shu, attack!

[SHU]
Uh, we tried that before, sire.

00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:24,500
[MAI] Do you have a plan
to defeat him, Emperor?

171
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:25,958
[PILAF]
No.

172
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:29,541
[MAI, SHU] What! Then how do
you expect us to win?

173
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:33,333
I haven't found the Bansho fan.
That's why I'm here.

174
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:36,125
That's too bad. Bye!

You look upset. Can I
help you with something?

[PILAF]
You trouble maker!

One of your friends
is a woman, right?

[PILAF] You moron!
This is all your fault!

194
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:28,833
That's why the storm is blowing.

195

[PILAF]
Why you! I--

--[SHU] Huh?
--[PILAF]What did you say?

198
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:36,291
For some reason, the mountain
doesn't like women.

199
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:39,041
When one enters,
it causes a storm.

200
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:41,833
What? But that's ridiculous!

Yes, sire?

[PILAF] I want you
to leave the mountain!

You can't be serious.

206

Don't miss this time!

up again, sire?

Destroy him!

you do that to me?

you kept bees in here.

[OCTAGON] Yes. Did you finish
cleaning the entire house?

Yes, I have.
Everything's spotless.

Now you can sweep the yard.

I'd use it sparingly, dear.
There are no refills.

It may just come in handy.

00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:56,583
[laughs]

325
00:19:58,458 --> 00:20:02,041
[PILAF] Get off the mountain
and go find some help!

326
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:05,208
One of us has to be brave,
and it's not going to be me!

327
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:09,208
ChiChi! Goku!

328
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:17,750
I won't give up!
Nothing's going to prevent me

329
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:20,166
from seeing my daughter
wear this dress!

330
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:21,333
[yells]

331
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:35,291
Papa! We found the Bansho fan!
Hold on, we're coming!

332
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:37,333
[CROWD cheering]

333
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:44,375
Where have you been? You've
missed all the excitement!

334
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:47,375
[GOKU] Ox King! You'd better
grab hold of something sturdy.

335
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:49,708
Otherwise, you'll be blown away!

336
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:53,916
[OX KING]
I'm ready!

337
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,041
Do it now!

338
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:56,208
Okay!

339
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:01,083
[yelling]

340
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:15,958
[CROWD cheering]

341
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:17,833
It worked!

342
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:19,708
We did it!

343
00:21:19,791 --> 00:21:21,875
It's over!

344
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,833
Goku, the flames
are still rising!

345
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:42,875
Fine! If it's a
fight you want,

346
00:21:42,958 --> 00:21:46,333
I won't stop swinging until
every last flame is put out!

347
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:50,375
[yelling]

348
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:55,333
[GOKU grunting]

349
00:22:11,541 --> 00:22:12,791
It's raining!

350
00:22:12,875 --> 00:22:15,000
This will put the
fire out for sure!

351
00:22:24,666 --> 00:22:26,875
[NARRATOR]
The villagers watch in horror

352
00:22:26,958 --> 00:22:30,166
as the flames continue to rise.

353
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:32,708
[OX KING]
ChiChi!

354
00:22:36,875 --> 00:22:39,875
Papa!

355
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:42,125
[NARRATOR]
With the Bansho fan doing little

356
00:22:42,208 --> 00:22:46,000
against the mysterious fire,
will Goku be able to save

357
00:22:46,083 --> 00:22:49,750
the Ox King's kingdom
before it burns to the ground?

358
00:22:49,833 --> 00:22:55,416
