00:02:12,916 --> 00:02:14,916
[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball,

2
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,416
Goku climbed Korin Tower in
pursuit of the Sacred Water,

3
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,750
a potion believed to
give increased strength

4
00:02:20,833 --> 00:02:22,250
to whoever consumes it.

5
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:25,916
What he found instead
was Korin himself.

6
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,166
The wise guardian
agreed to give Goku

7
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:31,708
the enchanted liquid,
provided he could get it.

8
00:02:31,791 --> 00:02:34,333
[GOKU yells]

9
00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:36,041
[NARRATOR]
The young warrior fought hard

10
00:02:36,125 --> 00:02:38,166
to wrestle the bottle
from Korin's paws.

11
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:41,333
But no matter what he tried,
the plump pussycat

12
00:02:41,416 --> 00:02:43,833
stayed one step ahead of him.

13
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:48,166
[GOKU panting]

14
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:51,625
You can't be that tired. Come
on, we're just gettin' started!

15
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:56,625
[NARRATOR] As Goku continued
his relentless pursuit

16
00:02:56,708 --> 00:02:59,958
for the bottle,
Korin revealed a shocking truth.

17
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:03,625
In 300 years, only one
person had ever managed

18
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:05,791
to capture the
Sacred Water from him.

19
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:08,000
Master Roshi.

20
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:09,375
[GOKU] Was he really fast?

21
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:12,125
How long did it take him
to get the bottle from you?

22
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:16,750
Whoa! Just three minutes?!

23
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:18,583
Three years.

24
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:25,916
[NARRATOR] Goku's quest for the
Sacred Water continues today.

25
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:39,125
Thr-Three years?!

26
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:53,833
It really took that long
for Master Roshi

27
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:56,041
to get to the Sacred Water?

28
00:03:56,125 --> 00:03:57,333
That's right.

29
00:03:57,416 --> 00:04:00,291
Now, how long do you
think it's gonna take you?

30
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:03,000
[KORIN laughs]

31
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:04,833
Stop that! It's not funny.

32
00:04:04,916 --> 00:04:07,458
I have to get that
extra strength right now.

33
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:09,541
I don't have much time.

34
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:15,791
My friends are in trouble!

35
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:20,333
[GOKU growls] I'm going to
get that water from you,

36
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:22,083
whatever it takes!

37
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:37,416
[KORIN yawns]
The rain always makes me sleepy.

38
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,833
Huh?

39
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:41,166
The bottle will be right here
whenever you want it,

40
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:43,000
so just let me know.

41
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:44,791
And, try not to worry so much.

42
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:48,833
Three years can
go by pretty quickly.

43
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:54,083
Uh. But-But...

44
00:04:55,916 --> 00:04:59,500
All right! That's it.
I'm getting that water!

45
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:03,541
I'm getting it right now!

46
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:05,875

48
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:17,083

Ah, the ol' afterimage trick.

[KORIN chuckles]

51
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:26,583
Looks like I found
the right one here.

52
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:27,750
[GOKU]
Ha!

53
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:29,208
I've got you now!

[KORIN laughs]

56
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:38,375
[KORIN] Thanks for the
entertainment, kid.

57
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:41,541
That was fun. Good night.

58
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:45,041
Come back!

59
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:49,208
I can still fight.
Once the room stops spinning.

[KORIN yawns]

61
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:02,875
[GOKU thinking] I can do this.
Just one more try.

I forgot... I...

65
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:12,916
...haven't eaten
anything since yesterday.

66
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:18,291
Ah! That reminds me,
I haven't eaten anything

67
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:21,541
in five years.
Why don't we grab some lunch?

68
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:23,166
I know just the thing.

[KORIN]
Lunch is ready! Come get it!

72
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:43,333
Lunch?

73
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:48,291
[GOKU panting]

74
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:50,416

Hungry?

Here ya go. Enjoy.

78
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:05,250
This is a bean! All I get
for lunch is a single bean?!

00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:06,875
[GOKU gasps]

80
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:10,250
[GOKU] Are you kidding?
This isn't fair!

81
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,416
One is all you need.

82
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:16,250
[KORIN]
It's a Senzu Bean.

83
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:18,916
Magical-- Just one will keep you
full for at least ten days.

84
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,708
But, uh, you have
to eat it first.

85
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:25,166
I don't think this is
going to fill me up.

86
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:27,291
I can eat a lot.

87
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:36,291
[GOKU burps]
Ah...

88
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:39,000
[KORIN]
You feel light-headed and weak.

89
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:40,875
But your appetite
isn't the problem.

90
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:43,083
At this altitude,
the air is much thinner

91
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:44,416
than you're used to,

92
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,041
so all that wasted energy
you're throwin' around

93
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:49,291
is bringing you back down. So,
you should move like you speak,

94
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:51,583
with purpose and
clear direction.

95
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:53,500
Commit your mind and focus.

96
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:57,291
Distraction is the
root of all failure.

97

Uh-huh.

00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:03,708

[GOKU grunts]
I found it!

Huh?

112
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:36,666
I thought I saw
something moving.

113
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:41,125
But it couldn't have been Goku.
It was much too fast.

114
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:44,416
I think my eyes
are playing tricks on me.

Three hours round trip, not bad.

It's the Four-Star Ball and
it's very, very important to me!

Hey! Are you listening to me?

tried with all his might,

both the Sacred Water and
Korin's advice eluded him.
