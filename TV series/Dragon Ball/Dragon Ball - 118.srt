[NARRATOR]
Previously on Dragon Ball,

2
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:16,666
King Piccolo launched an
attack on the Eastern City,

3
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:19,625
laying it to waste,
and declaring himself

4
00:02:19,708 --> 00:02:21,958
ruler of the sector.

5
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:24,500
[BOTH yell]

00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:26,541
[NARRATOR]
Meanwhile, Tien Shinhan,

7
00:02:26,625 --> 00:02:30,041
consumed with his desire
to destroy King Piccolo,

8
00:02:30,125 --> 00:02:33,083
mastered the
Evil Containment Wave.

9
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:39,916
[TIEN]
I've done it.

10
00:02:42,958 --> 00:02:46,333
[NARRATOR] Goku downed the
dangerous Ultra Divine Water

11
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:48,833
in hopes of increasing
his abilities.

12
00:02:48,916 --> 00:02:51,500
The gamble paid off,
as he was rewarded

13
00:02:51,583 --> 00:02:55,458
with mysteriously
strengthened powers.

14
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:57,083
[roars]

15
00:02:57,166 --> 00:03:01,458
I don't know. I feel different,
but I just can't explain it.

16
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:04,333
[NARRATOR] King Piccolo
began his reign of terror

17
00:03:04,416 --> 00:03:06,583
with a nationally
televised announcement

18
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:08,833
of horrific proportions.

19
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:15,083
My first decree is
to abolish the police

20
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:17,000
and release all criminals!

21
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:20,708
I want riots!
Order is legally dead!

22
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:23,750
[NARRATOR] As a result of
Piccolo's savage policies,

23
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:26,875
pandemonium erupted
in the streets as reason

24
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:30,375
gave way to unbridled chaos.

25
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:32,666

[hollering]

27
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:46,500
[PUAR] Guys, come in here!
It's another news bulletin.

28
00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:49,333
[PICCOLO] Good afternoon,
my loyal citizens.

29
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:52,500
I have more news
of terror and mayhem!

30
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:54,500
As members of my new order,

31
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:57,500
you should all prepare
for destruction.

32
00:03:57,583 --> 00:04:00,958
Lousy monster!
Who does he think he is?!

33
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:06,208
Get ready as I unleash the most
glorious terror imaginable!

34
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:08,416
Is he serious?!

35
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,916
[PICCOLO]
No need to worry, however.

36
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,458
I've taken care of
all the arrangements.

37
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:16,041
I know that all of you
share my enthusiasm.

38
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:18,125
Because, it is
a privilege and honor

39
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:21,333
to be a part of this event.

40
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:23,333
You're gonna love this!

41
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:28,916
[PICCOLO]
Your planet, heh, my planet,

42
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,958
is divided into 43 sectors.

43
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:33,041
Each is represented
by a slip of paper

44
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:36,083
which has been
placed in this box.

45
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:38,208
To commemorate the
anniversary of my rule,

46
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:42,083
I declare this day,
May 13th, as Piccolo Day.

47
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:43,750
As part of this
annual celebration,

48
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:46,333
I'll draw a slip
from the box each year.

49
00:04:46,416 --> 00:04:49,541
And guess what folks.
There's more.

50
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:51,250
[chuckles]

51
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,125
[BOTH whimper]

52
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:59,083
The chosen sector will
host that year's celebration,

53
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:02,458
which will culminate
in its destruction.

54
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:05,125
And I will do the honors.

55
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:08,541
No! You wouldn't!

56
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:10,083
I am not without mercy.

57
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:13,750
The sector's annihilation
will be instantaneous.

58
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:16,708
There will hardly
be time to feel any pain.

59
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:19,708
That's horrific! Why would
you do something so cruel?!

60
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:22,666
Hm! It's nothing new.
This world celebrates

61
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:25,208
occasions with
explosions in the sky.

62
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:27,958
Mine are just a
little more dangerous.

63
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:32,000
Besides, I can't wait to see
the terror on peoples' faces.

64
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:35,000
And after all,
it is my celebration.

65
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:39,208
[laughs]

66
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:41,458
That maniac!

67
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:43,666
He's an A-1 sicko.

68
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:50,333
Please, don't worry. This is
meant to be happy fun time.

69
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:52,916
The drawing will only
be held once a year.

70
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,041
That means,
if you're lucky,

71
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:56,541
some of you may live
another 43 years.

72
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:58,041
[laughs]
Or not!

73
00:05:58,125 --> 00:06:00,833
[laughs]

74
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:03,750
43 years?! Oh, how generous!

75
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:06,333
I'd rather be destroyed now than
have to live my life in fear!

76
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:08,333
[PICCOLO] But seriously,
I wish to maintain

77
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:10,125
an open dialogue
with my subjects.

78
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:12,291
So, if for any reason
you are displeased

79
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:14,166
with my plan
or any of my policies,

80
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,791
please feel free
to pay me a visit.

81
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,375
My door is always open.

82
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:20,333
Tell me what's on your tiny
little minds. I'm here for you.

83
00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:22,833
And once you've unloaded
all your emotional baggage,

84
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:26,750
I promise to remove your
troubles, permanently.

85
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:28,583
[laughs]

86
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:32,791
Daddy! I'm so scared.
Please say you'll defeat him.

87
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:35,625
Please say you'll save me from
that mean old King Piccolo!

88
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:38,791
Uh, well, you see ChiChi,
uh, Daddy wants to

89
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:42,416
defeat that monster, but it's
impossible, mmm sweetheart.

90
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:46,208
But Daddy, is he really
stronger than you?

91
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:47,791
Afraid so, Muffinhead.

92
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:51,375
No one of this world
can defeat that beast.

93
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:54,375
Uh, what about...
Goku! That's it!

94
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:57,041
Goku can defeat him,
right Daddy? Right?

95
00:06:57,125 --> 00:07:02,791
No. No way.
Not even Goku. Sorry.

96
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:07,666
Yes he can, Dad. Goku will
defeat King Piccolo! I know it!

97
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:28,333
Now Goku can beat Piccolo.
Don't you think?

98
00:07:28,416 --> 00:07:30,875
[KORIN]
I don't know.

99
00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:34,500
See, the outcome
rests in the hands of fate.

100
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:36,666
Goku has the necessary skills.

101
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:40,750
However,
that's not always enough.

102
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:43,083
That doesn't fill me
with confidence.

103
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:46,875
Anyway, at a time like this,
I'd rather be filled with food.

104
00:07:46,958 --> 00:07:49,875
I'm gonna stuff my belly with
everything I can fit into it!

105
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:53,208
Go for it. Have as many
Senzu Beans as you want.

106
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:56,333
I don't want beans
at a time like this!

107
00:07:56,416 --> 00:07:59,208
I'm a gourmet at heart.
I want something special!

108
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:01,750
Oh!

109
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:03,000
It's time for a road trip.

110
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:05,875
I'll find something
really tasty!

111
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:09,000
Do you mind if I borrow your
Nimbus Cloud for a while?

112
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:11,083
Like I said before,
the Nimbus Cloud

113

will do you no good, Yajirobe.

You have to be

Heh. I'll tell you something.

You're nothing.

so much better than me,

00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:26,041
What do you mean?

321
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:28,416
[PICCOLO]
It's a surprise.

322
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:34,375
[grunting]

323
00:21:34,458 --> 00:21:45,625
[gutteral gasps, groans]

324
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:48,375
[yells]

325
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:53,500
Ugh! What is that?!

326
00:21:58,708 --> 00:22:01,833
Uh! No! Not another one!

327
00:22:03,708 --> 00:22:09,625
[CREATURE laughs intensely]

328
00:22:09,708 --> 00:22:13,250
Your name shall be Drum.
Your first official duty

329
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:16,000
will be to teach
this idiot a lesson.

330
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:19,500
[laughs]

331
00:22:19,583 --> 00:22:21,250
What are you laughing at?

332
00:22:21,333 --> 00:22:22,416
With looks like that,

333
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,833
I'm surprised you have
a sense of humor.

334
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:43,500
Piccolo! Arrrh!
You're finished!

335
00:22:43,583 --> 00:22:47,125
[NARRATOR] Tien Shinhan was
prepared to fight King Piccolo.

336
00:22:47,208 --> 00:22:49,333
But what of this new menace?

337
00:22:49,416 --> 00:22:51,833
Will Goku arrive
in time to help?

338
00:22:51,916 --> 00:22:55,125
Find out next time,
on Dragon Ball!
