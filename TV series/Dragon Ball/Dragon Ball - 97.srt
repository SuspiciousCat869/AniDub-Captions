Okay, all together now.

as a contestant!

Do you need
recognition that badly?

[ROSHI] Not everyone
is as vain as you.

I just wanted to keep
an eye on my students.

[SHEN] You should keep
an eye on that waistline.

You looked pathetic up there!

The final match in the
World Martial Arts Tournament

00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,750
is about to begin!

202

[CROWD cheering, hollering]

203
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:37,166
We began with 182 fighters

204
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:38,750
gathered from
around the world.

205
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:42,666
Eight of which advanced
to the semi-finals.

206
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:45,041
Now there are but
two fighters remaining,

207
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:48,000
one of which will become the
new Master of Martial Arts,

not to mention walk away
with a cool 500,000 zeni!

Not bad for a few days' work,
wouldn't you say?

Ha-ha-ha! Who will it be?

While you ponder that,
let me provide

212
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:04,916
a little background
on our contestants.

213
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,083
First up... Tien Shinhan.

214
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:17,541
[CROWD cheering]

215
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:19,208
This skilled performer
has become

216
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:22,833
the fighter to watch
during the tournament.

217
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:25,541
Prized pupil of the
Crane Hermit, Master Shen,

218
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:28,958
it is widely regarded that Tien
Shinhan's abilities rival,

219
00:16:29,041 --> 00:16:31,625
if not surpass
those of his master.

220
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:33,958
We've already witnessed
an incredible display

221
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:37,208
of his strength as he left
Yamcha with a broken leg,

222
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:39,875
and forced previous
champion, Jackie Chun,

223
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:42,166
out of the semi-finals.

224
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:44,250
Combine that with the fact
that his average

225
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:46,916
fight time is 32.5 seconds,

226
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,208
and you have a glimpse
into the awesome power

227
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:53,041
that is Tien Shinhan!

228
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:56,125
Our second contestant is Goku!

229
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:57,791
[KRILLIN]
Goku!

230
00:16:57,875 --> 00:17:00,791
No matter what happens,
you have to beat Tien.

231
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:02,375
Right!

232
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:09,166
[CROWD cheering]

233
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:13,041
This pint-sized warrior serves
the Turtle Hermit, Master Roshi,

234
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:15,208
who coincidentally
just happens to be

235
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:17,875
the archrival of Master Shen.

236
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:20,375
Aside from the fact that
he received second place

237
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:23,208
in the last tournament,
Goku's list of victories

238
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:25,375
would leave even
the most veteran fighter

239
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:27,166
green with envy.

240
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:29,458
He most recently dazzled
the audience with his

241
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:33,458
one-punch dismissal of world-
renowned champion Pamput

242
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:35,875
and the unique
disappearing act he used

243
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:39,000
to unceremoniously remove
Krillin from the ring

244
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:40,833
in the previous match.

245
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:45,250
His average fight time
is 35.7 seconds.

246
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:50,166
[ROSHI] This should be
one heck of a finale.

247
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,916
We're with you, Goku!

start with the smackin'!

who will become the Champion

of the 22nd World Martial
Arts Tournament begins.

see a fight like this again.

My brother was no saint.

die at the hands of a child.

won't bring Tao back,
