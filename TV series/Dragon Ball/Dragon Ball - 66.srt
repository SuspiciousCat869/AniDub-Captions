00:02:16,458 --> 00:02:18,583
[NARRATOR]
Previously on Dragon Ball...

2
00:02:18,666 --> 00:02:20,875
Fearing Goku would attack
the Red Ribbon Army

3
00:02:20,958 --> 00:02:23,833
by himself, Bulma dispatched
a probe to search

4
00:02:23,916 --> 00:02:26,250
for her friend and
any sign of trouble.

5
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:28,291
Determining her
suspicion was valid;

6
00:02:28,375 --> 00:02:31,000
she assembled Yamcha and
the others to assist Goku

7
00:02:31,083 --> 00:02:33,125
in his risky assault.

8
00:02:34,708 --> 00:02:36,958
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile,
Commander Red anxiously

9
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:40,291
awaited the return of Mercenary
Tao and the Dragon Balls

10
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:42,333
he was to have stolen from Goku.

11
00:02:42,416 --> 00:02:45,625
However, it was Goku,
not the hired assassin,

12
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:50,791
who prevailed and was now on his
way to face the maniacal tyrant.

13
00:02:54,416 --> 00:02:56,916
[NARRATOR] No matter the cost,
Goku was determined

14
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,333
to retrieve the Dragon Balls
in Commander Red's possession.

15
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:02,958
For only with all seven
balls could he summon

16
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:07,208
the Eternal Dragon and
restore life to Upa's father.

17
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:10,750
[NARRATOR] And so,
Goku and his friends

18
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:13,541
have embarked on their most
perilous adventure yet.

19
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:15,625
One that will lead
them to war against

20
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:18,833
the entire Red Ribbon empire.

21
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:30,166
[NARRATOR] It's time!
The final showdown has begun!

22
00:03:58,458 --> 00:03:59,875
[YAMCHA]
So far, so good.

23
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:03,458
The navigational radar is clear
and all systems check out.

24
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:11,333
[YAMCHA] We've now reached
cruising altitude.

25
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:14,708
[OOLONG] This trip is as far
from a cruise as you can get!

26
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:20,083
I don't know why we even
bothered to bring him.

27
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:22,041
All he does is
think about himself!

28
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:25,250
Why risk my life?
Give me one good reason.

29
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:27,500
You're going; it's not
up for discussion!

30
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:29,291
Anyway, I can
remember a time or two

31
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:31,708
when Goku helped
you out of a jam!

32
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:33,250
[TURTLE]
Uh, Excuse me, Yamcha?

33
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:35,375
Do you think there's
anything that an old turtle

34
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:37,541
like me can do to help?

35
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:39,500
[LAUNCH] I think we could
put ya to good use!

36
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:42,416
Yes sir, turtle soup will
make a nice victory meal!

37
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,458
--[ALL scream]
--No, Launch, No!

38
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:47,250
That girl is nuts!

39
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:48,500
Hey, Master Roshi?

40
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:49,791
Yeah, son?

41
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:51,958
Do you have any idea
where Krillin ran off to?

42
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:53,708
He went for a swim
across the sea,

43
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:56,125
and some shopping
on the mainland.

44
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:59,750
He was too impatient to wait
until he could get a ride.

45
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:02,375
We could sure use his help, too.

46
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:05,125
Do you think we could
still catch up to him?

47
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:06,708
[ROSHI]
We oughtta be able to spot him

48
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:09,291
--if we fly a little lower-- Ah!
--[YAMCHA] Cool. Now, everyone

49
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:10,666
keep your eyes peeled!

50
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:39,500
Please tell me you remembered to
disarm all the defense systems.

51
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:40,625
[STAFF OFFICER]
Of course!

52
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:42,333
Checked and
double-checked, Commander!

53
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:43,750
[RED]
Good.

54
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:45,666
A shower of missiles wouldn't
make a very good welcome

55
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,208
for Mercenary Tao.

56
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:49,208
No sir!

57
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:53,000
[RED chuckles]
Four more Dragon Balls...

58
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:56,666
Did you make the arrangements
for the banquet in Tao's honor?

59
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:59,083
Yes. It's all done.

60
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:04,541
[beeping]

61
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:07,750
[SIGNALMAN]
Unit 84, unit 8-4.

62
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:10,791
Locate Mercenary Tao and escort
him to the main building.

63
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:12,416
Roger that!

64
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:38,333
[KRILLIN grunting]

65
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:41,500
[KRILLIN]
I've been out here forever...

66
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:50,708
[KRILLIN yelps]

67
00:06:50,791 --> 00:07:00,791
[KRILLIN panting]

68
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:09,083
[KRILLIN panting]

69
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,208
[KRILLIN gasps]

70
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:19,500
[KRILLIN screams]

71
00:07:19,583 --> 00:07:20,875
Huh?

72
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:21,583
Krillin!

73
00:07:21,666 --> 00:07:22,791
Did we scare you?

74
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:24,208
[KRILLIN] Nah, I was
just messin' with ya.

75
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:26,666
What's up?
You have great timing.

76
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,916
I was hoping for a ride home!

77
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,666
[BULMA]
Well, get in, quick!

78
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,375
[KRILLIN]
Uh, okay... Hey!

79
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:35,333
What happened to my clothes?

80
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:37,583
Krillin! Get in the plane!

81
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:41,125
[KRILLIN] Would it have killed
you to go back for my stuff?

82
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:44,916
Ugh! Watch it! If my hair
frizzes, you're in trouble!

83
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,791
Oh! Sorry, Bulma.

84
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:48,666
Did I hear you say
Goku's on his way

85
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:51,833
to the Red Ribbon
compound by himself?!

86
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:53,041
Yep, that's right.

87
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:56,041
What in the world
was he thinking?!

88
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:58,041
He's obviously not thinking!

89
00:07:58,125 --> 00:07:59,666
[OOLONG]
You can say that again!

90
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:02,375
Heh, heh! This'll be fun!

91
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:03,416
[KRILLIN]
You know Launch,

92
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,875
everyone else
sees this as work...

93
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:06,250
But I get the feeling
you're actually

94
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:09,416
looking forward to it,
like a vacation.

95
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,625
Hey Bulma!

96
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:13,208
Am I going the right
direction here? Look!

97
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:14,416
[BULMA]
Hm...

98
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,083
[BULMA] You're on track.
Just fly straight.

99
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:19,500
How much time do we have
before we need to land?

100
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:22,833
Oh. I'd say about half an hour.

101
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:23,750
How's the fuel?

102
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:25,291
We'll have enough.

103
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:28,750
[OOLONG chuckles] Well, you two
make quite a team, don't ya?

104
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:29,833
When's the wedding?

105
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:30,625
[BOTH gasp]

106
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:32,666
Hey! Knock it off, Oolong!

107
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:35,000
[PUAR, OOLONG gasp]

108
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:38,041
Hmph. Yamcha?

109
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:39,541
Huh?

110
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:41,083
Don't think this
means that I'm not

111
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:42,666
mad at you anymore.

112
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:46,250
But this is an emergency, so we
can bury the hatchet for now.

113
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:48,125
But just for now!

114
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:49,583
Uh...

115
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:51,125
[TURTLE, PUAR]
Aw...

116
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:54,541
Uh... Okay, Bulma.

117
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:58,833
We'll talk everything out later
when we have plenty of time!

118
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:01,041
[OOLONG]
If we make it to 'later'.

119
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:24,958
[SIGNALMAN]
Huh? Sir!

120
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:26,541
He's arrived!

121
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:27,750
Good.

[SIGNALMAN]
Unit Number 84!

123

Come in! Come in 84! Do you have
a visual of Mercenary Tao yet?

124
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:35,833
[PILOT]
Yes, I see someone coming!

125
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:42,333
Huh?

126
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:45,166
Now to get those Dragon Balls!

127
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:49,125
Hey! It's not Tao!
It's some kid on a cloud!

128

[GOKU yells]

129
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:51,125
Oh, no!

Go!

[SIGNALMAN]
I'm losing you, 84!

138
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:23,791
Can you hear me, soldier?
Unit 84, what's happening?

139
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:25,041
[RED]
What now?

140
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,083
The helicopter may have
been intercepted, sir!

141
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:29,375
What?! How can that be?!

142
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:33,250
[BEAR screams] Men! Switch the
views on the radar! Sir!

143
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:34,333
[RED]
What've you got?

144
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:35,833
[BEAR]
It's him!

145
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:40,625
[RED screams] No! How did
that punk kid get in here?

146
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:43,333
[STAFF OFFICER] The boy must
have defeated Mercenary Tao!

147
00:10:43,416 --> 00:10:45,708
How can that be possible?

148
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:48,041
Get that security system
up and running again,

149
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:51,625
and call all available men
to their posts immediately!

150
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:53,041
[BEAR]
Yes, Commander!

151
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,875
[SIGNALMAN] Get the defense
shield up right now!

152
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:13,666
[RED growls] You little brat!
I'll get you this time!

153
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:30,083
[GOKU grunting]

154
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:41,916
The calculations
have been completed.

155
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:47,916
Battle units! Stay alert
and await further orders!

156
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,791
[UNIT SOLDIER] Roger!
[RED] Do it now!

157
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:52,166
[BEAR]
We're all set up, sir!

158
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:55,250
Then its all systems go
for a little pest control!

we reach their base?

if anyone is following us.

out there but snow.

Oh, no... I think
I see something!

What is that Bulma?

224
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:56,541
[BULMA]
It's a shark!

Now?

It's right on our tail!

[BULMA] I've seen this before.
It's a chaser missile!

They're programmed
to never give up.

233

Now that's persistence!

should've gone home!

What do you mean?

240
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:42,333
Okay, I think it's activated
by a heat source.

So, what do we do?

242

Get rid of the booster jet.

243
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:54,708
See, it only chases
the source of the heat.

244
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:58,333
It's a bit unsophisticated
by modern day standards.

Well, it still almost got us!

to a secure location.

some little squirt of a kid!

enough to beat Tao,

are running in terror!

He's made it to Wing Eight,

279

and we've lost half of
our men already, sir!

And I don't care!

this army is unstoppable,

on it! Hurry up!

The odds are against us. The
kid is incredibly strong, sir.

The complex is in total chaos.

best officers out of commission

know how to work an elevator.

302
00:21:53,416 --> 00:21:56,208
Somebody explain to me how
the world's strongest army

303
00:21:56,291 --> 00:21:58,708
could lose to this imbecile?!

304
00:22:06,208 --> 00:22:08,250
[NARRATOR]
Goku is closing in on his goal

305
00:22:08,333 --> 00:22:11,166
of confiscating the Dragon Balls
from Commander Red.

306
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:13,708
So far, the Red Ribbon
forces have been

307
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:15,958
unable to withstand
our hero's assault.

308
00:22:16,041 --> 00:22:19,000
But for how long can Goku
sustain his offensive against

309
00:22:19,083 --> 00:22:20,500
these overwhelming odds?

310
00:22:20,583 --> 00:22:23,458
Hopefully, long enough for
Yamcha and the rest of the gang

311
00:22:23,541 --> 00:22:25,041
to come to his aid!

312
00:22:25,125 --> 00:22:27,166
Because if Commander Red
has his way,

313
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:30,916
then Goku is about to be
stopped in his tracks!

314
00:22:35,625 --> 00:22:37,750
[NARRATOR]
You won't want to miss round two

315
00:22:37,833 --> 00:22:42,291
of this important battle,
next time on Dragon Ball!
