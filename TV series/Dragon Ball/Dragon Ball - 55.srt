[BULMA screams]

2
00:02:12,708 --> 00:02:14,333
[KRILLIN]
It's not fair!

3
00:02:14,416 --> 00:02:18,458
[BULMA]
I'm too beautiful to die!

4
00:02:18,541 --> 00:02:21,333
[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball...

5
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:27,458
[GOKU]
Ha!

6
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:32,208
[NARRATOR] Though our
heroes were unable to claim

7
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:34,833
the pirate's treasure, they did
not leave empty handed,

8
00:02:34,916 --> 00:02:37,708
thanks to the diamond Bulma
grabbed during her escape.

9
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:39,541
[BULMA]
I got a souvenir.

10
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:41,625
[NARRATOR] The hefty jewel
created quite a stir

11
00:02:41,708 --> 00:02:44,041
amongst the others,
especially Master Roshi.

12
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:45,916
[ROSHI] Are you insinuating
that I don't make

13
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,750
sound financial decisions?!

14
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:48,625
Yes.

15
00:02:48,708 --> 00:02:49,750
[ROSHI]
Why you no good--!

16
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:51,791
[NARRATOR]
However, Launch's alter ego

17
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:55,625
proved that diamonds are
a bad-girl's best friend.

18
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:57,666
Hand it over before someone...

19
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:58,625
...gets hurt.

20
00:02:58,708 --> 00:03:01,250
[ALL yelp]

21
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,583
Thanks.

22
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:06,875
[NARRATOR]
Just as the gang was recovering

23
00:03:06,958 --> 00:03:08,500
from Launch's surprise attack,

24
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:12,375
General Blue decided
to drop by for a visit...

25
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:15,083
And he didn't come to
borrow a cup of sugar.

26
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:17,708
[ROSHI] Nooooo! That
diamond is mine! I want it!

27
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:21,416
Bring it back! It's not fair!
Bring me my diamond back!

28
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,625
[BLUE]
There's no need to get so upset.

29
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:27,833
Life is too short. Well,
at least yours is anyway.

30
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:42,041
[ROSHI]
What a beautiful sight!

31
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:46,708
Like little, white, soft cotton
balls stuck in the sky.

32
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:49,500
I'd like to pluck one down
and just bury my face in it!

33
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:51,666
I lost my dream
somewhere between

34
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,875
the ocean and the
bottom of this glass.

35
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:55,125
That's pretty deep.

36
00:03:55,208 --> 00:03:58,208
But is that you talking
or just the fruit-punch?

37
00:03:58,291 --> 00:04:00,208
[ROSHI]
She loves me not...

38
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:06,875
She loves me. She loves me not.
She loves me. She loves me not.

39
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:09,833
Goku, are you ready
for some time off?

40
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:13,083
Sure. After I find
Grandpa's four-star ball.

41
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:15,791
Suit yourself.
Me, I'm going home.

42
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:18,666
No more adventures...
Oh, which reminds me.

43
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,166
Can I borrow your airplane?

44
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,833
[ROSHI gasps]

45
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:24,625
[ROSHI]
Sure. If you don't mind

46
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:26,833
retrieving my diamond
from Launch first.

47
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:28,250
That's impossible!

48
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:31,541
I can't get the diamond back.
I need transportation.

49
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:34,000
We could always work out
another arrangement.

50
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:35,916
Forget about it!

51
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:42,083
[BLUE cackles]

52
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:44,208
[BLUE] Those amateurs
don't stand a chance

53
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:47,333
against my enhanced
mental capabilities.

57

[GOKU sniffs] Hey, do you
smell something funny?

58
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:17,875
Sorry.

59
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:20,666
Oh yeah, I forgot.
You don't have a nose.

[KRILLIN growls]

61
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:31,166
I can take you to the shore,
but it might take me a while.

62
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:35,625
[BULMA growls] Great, I've been
reduced to traveling by turtle!

63
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:45,958
Oh, Master Roshi, will you keep
one more Dragon Ball for me?

64
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:47,041
Certainly.

65
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:48,791
I think we're
forgetting something...

66
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:51,666
Anyone holding these balls is a
target for the Red Ribbon Army.

67
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,458
I am a master warrior.

68
00:05:53,541 --> 00:05:56,375
Any attack on me would be folly.

we're being attacked!

What are these things?!

It's you!

[BULMA whimpers]
You can't be here!

You're dead!

Who are you?

[BLUE cackles] Someone you
should fear, old man.

91
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:28,166
[ROSHI]
You're not scary. You're sick.

92
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:31,291
[BLUE] On the contrary,
I've never felt better.

93
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:36,333
Ah, what a beautiful sight.

94
00:07:36,416 --> 00:07:41,291
The Dragon Ball, like your
fate, is now in my hands.

[BLUE sighs]

97
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:48,333
[BLUE] Now why do I get
the feeling there's something

98
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:49,875
you're not telling me?

99
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:52,833
Oh yes, the other Dragon Balls.

100
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:55,750
You do have more tucked
away somewhere, don't you?

101
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:57,750
Where are they?

102
00:07:57,833 --> 00:08:00,125
Hm...

103
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:08,208
Ah! Yes!

104
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:12,166
[GOKU grunting]
No!

105
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:19,166
Hm. Mm-hm... Mm-hm!

106
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:23,083
Here.

107
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:27,583
[BLUE] Hm. Oh! Perfect.
They're even gift-wrapped.

You maniac! Why in
the world are you

110
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:35,666
so interested in collecting
the Dragon Balls anyway?!

111
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,083
Who can say?

112
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:39,125
Commander Red's
purpose is his own.

113
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:42,208
I've simply been ordered
to retrieve them.

114
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:44,000
[BLUE]
But you needn't concern yourself

115
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:45,583
with any of this, my dear.

116
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:47,750
After all, what is there
really to worry about

117
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:49,833
when you're dead?

118
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:51,708
[BLUE cackles]

119
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:54,333

to detonate in five minutes.

[BULMA yelps]

121
00:08:56,958 --> 00:08:58,916
[BLUE] That should allow
plenty of time for you

122
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,708
to try and save
yourselves but...

123
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:04,458
...not enough to succeed.

124
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:09,833
Hm.

125
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,625
Hey wait! You don't
want to kill us!

126
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:21,458
I can help you find
the other Dragon Balls!

[KRILLIN]
Bulma! Have you lost your mind?

128
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:29,416
I don't need the help
of a little girl. Please!

129
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,625
How 'bout an old man?

Master Roshi!

131
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:36,250
Bye... Wish I could stick around

132

to watch but I'm late
to collect my reward.

please do something!

You can save us, right?!

Well, there...

00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:15,583
...is a technique
I haven't tried yet.

There's a bomb!

We're gonna die!

Is this a new game?
Where'd you get the blue rope?

[BULMA]
Yeah, it's called Stay Alive!

Quick, grab the box and
throw it out of the house!

Why is there a clock
on the floor?

That's no clock, it's a

Oh no...

This house was spic
and span when I left

172
00:11:57,625 --> 00:12:00,583
and I don't appreciate
things being left out.

This is no joke!

Launch, there's no time.
Just untie me. Fast!

The rope is so tight.

There's this new invention.
It's called a knife!
