Last time on Dragon Ball,

2
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:17,791
the tournament continued as
Chiaotzu pitted his Dodon Ray

3
00:02:17,875 --> 00:02:22,750
against Krillin's Kamehameha
Wave. The result was a blast!

4
00:02:22,833 --> 00:02:24,833
Yet Chiaotzu stopped Krillin

5
00:02:24,916 --> 00:02:28,375
dead in his tracks with his
paralyzing power of thought.

It appeared Krillin
was done for,

7
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:32,666
until he turned the
tables on his foe,

8
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:35,583

[ROSHI] I didn't realize
how much Goku's strength

163
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:36,250
had increased until now.

164

I've sparred with him many

With Pamput, the licensing
rights alone are worth millions!

Yes. But only because
you have a match later on.

Well, now you've got it!

321
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:44,125
[PAMPUT grunts]

322
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:46,291
Hey!

323
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:49,208
What's the matter,
kid, scared stiff?

324
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:51,458
Or am I just too fast for you?

325
00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:54,000
Hm? Were you
stretching or punching,

326
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:55,375
'cause I couldn't tell.

327
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:56,500
What?!

328
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:01,375
You don't know who
you're dealing with.

329
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:04,875
I-It's not your fault.
You're just uneducated.

330
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:07,708
That's fine. In fact,
I'll bring you up to speed

331
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:10,166
with a little demonstration.

332
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,625
With your indulgence of course.

333
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:15,333
This is an odd request,
but you may proceed.

334
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:16,583
[PAMPUT grunts]

335
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:25,458
[PAMPUT yelling]

336
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:28,041
[PAMPUT grunting]

337
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:33,208
[PAMPUT yells]

338
00:19:33,291 --> 00:19:37,458
[CROWD cheers]

339
00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:39,208
He's so talented!

340
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:42,166
Just whose side
are you on, Bulma?

341
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:47,625
Goku's, of course!
Well, uh, maybe both.

342
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:50,375
We just had that
fixed yesterday.

343
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:53,666
[ROSHI] I can't complain.
He improved our view.

344
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:55,500
[PAMPUT]
Now you've witnessed my power,

345
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:56,916
and this is just a taste.

346
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:57,916
[GOKU]
Uh, okay.

347
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,750
You don't want seconds.

348
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:02,208
He talks like he's in a movie.

349
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:05,333
Yes, Krillin. A very bad movie.

350
00:20:06,458 --> 00:20:08,458
And now without further delay,

351
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:11,208
it's time to start
the 4th match.

352
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:13,083
[CROWD cheers]

353
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:14,708
30 seconds...

354
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:19,000
You get 30 seconds of Pamput's
time before you go down.

355
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:22,541
[ANNOUNCER]
Keep your eyes peeled, folks.

356
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:24,791
Because with these
two wild warriors

357
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:28,083
going head-to-head,
anything is possible!

358
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:32,000
Ready, fighters, and begin!

359
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:34,250
[PAMPUT] Remember my hair
is off limits, so is my back.

360
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:36,291
I just had it waxed.

361
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:41,666
[PAMPUT yells]

362
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:48,041
[PAMPUT groaning]

363
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:55,750
[PAMPUT gasping, groaning]

364
00:20:55,833 --> 00:21:01,708
[ANNOUNCER gasps] He's knocked
out! The winner is Goku!

365
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:03,833
[CROWD cheers]
[OOLONG] Goku, you did it!

366
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:05,333
Yay, Goku!

367
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:06,666
Pamput...

368
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:10,541
He's stronger in the movies.
Better looking, too.

369
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:12,000
[ANNOUNCER]
Who would have thought!

370
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:14,458
Pamput defeated with one punch!

371
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:17,083
Like I said, folks,
anything can happen.

372
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:19,791
And remember,
you saw it here first!

373
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:21,666
So much for the action hero.

374
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:24,708
Maybe he'll fight better
at the box office.

375
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:27,166
No, he's mistaken.

376
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:29,458
Pamput wasn't done in
with a single punch.

377
00:21:29,541 --> 00:21:31,375
From what I saw, there were
three separate hits

378
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:33,791
by Goku's elbow.

379
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:38,958
[TIEN growls]
He's no ordinary fighter.

380
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:45,125
Indeed. I no longer have any
doubt that he killed Tao.

381
00:21:45,208 --> 00:21:48,708
That's all I needed to hear.
Now I'm getting excited.

382
00:21:48,791 --> 00:21:49,916
[GOKU laughs]

383
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
You were incredible, Goku!

384
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:54,250
And I knew you'd beat Pamput
from the beginning!

385
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:56,375
There was no doubt that
that overblown windbag

386
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:58,166
was going to pop
sooner or later!

387
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:01,083
He wasn't strong at all.
Anyone could have beat him.

388
00:22:01,166 --> 00:22:03,916
[ROSHI laughs]
I don't think so...

389
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,500
Pamput may be a
self-absorbed, arrogant,

390
00:22:06,583 --> 00:22:08,500
pain-in-the-neck,
but beneath the hair

391
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:11,541
and publicity stunts is
an exceptional fighter.

392
00:22:11,625 --> 00:22:13,875
The reason he seemed weak
and ordinary to you

393
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:15,875
is because you are not.

394
00:22:15,958 --> 00:22:17,833
[GOKU, KRILLIN]
Huh?

395
00:22:17,916 --> 00:22:19,916
Both of you have proven
through your recent fights

396
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,291
that you have moved beyond the
limitations of ordinary men.

397
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:26,041
But, if we're stronger
than everyone else,

398
00:22:26,125 --> 00:22:29,291
why did Yamcha, who's as good
as we are, lose his match?

399
00:22:29,375 --> 00:22:31,916
And I myself had a
hard time beating Chiaotzu.

400
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,208
You're not the only
ones with an edge.

401
00:22:34,291 --> 00:22:38,833
In fact, Tien and Chiaotzu enjoy
the same advantages as you.

402
00:22:38,916 --> 00:22:40,750
[ROSHI]
Maybe more.

403
00:22:40,833 --> 00:22:42,416
[TIEN]
Your days are numbered, Goku,

404
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:45,166
and anyone who stands in my way!

405
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:46,750
[NARRATOR]
Don't miss the action

406
00:22:46,833 --> 00:22:50,208
on the next episode
of Dragon Ball!
