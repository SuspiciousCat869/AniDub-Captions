00:02:12,291 --> 00:02:14,000
[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball...

2
00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:16,791
Piccolo terrified the
citizens of Eastern City

3
00:02:16,875 --> 00:02:18,416
and it was up to
Goku to stop him.

4
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,416
The young hero did his best
to send the monster sailing,

5
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,750
but, even though he made
every punch and kick count,

6
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:27,000
Piccolo was still able to put
Goku's leg out of commission

7
00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:28,625
with a savage energy blast.

8
00:02:28,708 --> 00:02:32,458
But, with the help of his Power
Pole, the battle continued.

9
00:02:32,541 --> 00:02:35,375
[PICCOLO]
I have you now!

10
00:02:35,458 --> 00:02:41,250
[screams]

11
00:02:51,208 --> 00:02:53,416
[NARRATOR] Once the smoke
cleared, it looked like

12
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:58,708
there would be only
one warrior left standing.

13
00:02:58,791 --> 00:02:59,958
But it was not to be.

14
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:03,625
Thanks to Tien, Goku
escaped to the skies

15
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:05,625
and countered with
a power punch

16
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:09,625
that knocked the
wind out of Piccolo.

17
00:03:09,708 --> 00:03:12,666
[PICCOLO groaning]

18
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,375
[GOKU]
Aw! Darn it!

19
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:17,958
I couldn't hit him hard enough
because of my sore leg!

20
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:21,041
That's too bad! 'Cause
you're gonna pay for that!

21
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:24,541
[NARRATOR] Goku's attitude
made Piccolo go ballistic

22
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:27,875
as he pulled out all the stops
in a final attempt to destroy

23
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:29,958
the young warrior.

24
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:36,208
[NARRATOR]
The devastation Piccolo caused

25
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:39,500
left him exhausted, but
exhilarated at the same time.

26
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:43,875
Had he won the battle, and
obliterated Goku for good?

27
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,166
[PICCOLO] That's more
like it! I destroyed him.

28
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,333
Ha! Try again. I'm still here!

29
00:03:56,416 --> 00:04:00,041
[NARRATOR] The fight concludes
today on Dragon Ball!

30
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:11,666
[PICCOLO gasping]

31
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,708
[GOKU chuckles]

32
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:20,000
[GOKU] What's wrong? You
look surprised to see me.

33
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:23,125
That attack wasn't nearly
as good as the last one!

34
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:25,291
Uh?! I don't get it.
That's impossible.

35
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:27,250
How could you survive that?

36
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:28,750
I've fought all
over the universe

37
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:30,625
and I've never met
anyone with the stength

38
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:32,166
to face me in hand-
to-hand combat!

39
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,875
[laughs]

40
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:37,166
Well I guess I'm not like other
people because I've got a tail.

41
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:41,083
Ha, ha, ha. Do you wanna see
just how powerful I really am?

42
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:43,041
Well just try and
attack me again,

43
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:45,583
if you've got any
energy left! Ha, ha.

44
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:46,333
Come on I'm ready!

45
00:04:46,416 --> 00:04:50,375

[PICCOLO laughing]

00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:16,583
Now, look who's in control!

50
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:19,625
I think you'll agree
I've got the upper hand!

--[PICCOLO chuckling]

Ow! That's gotta hurt!

54
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:30,333
You do as I say

55
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:32,666
or I'll really put the
squeeze on your friend!

56

[TIEN gasps]

57
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:34,958
Don't move!

58
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:37,750
Take one more step closer,
and I'll give this guy

59
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:40,000
a headache he's never
gonna forget!

Uh. Goku, forget about me!

63
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:50,708
Just make sure you
destroy this monster! Ah!

Stop it! Stop it, you monster!

--[YAMCHA gasps]
--[BULMA, LUNCH screaming]

68
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:26,000
This must be the work of
Piccolo. It has to be!

69
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:28,708
Eastern City's been
completely wiped out.

70
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:30,666
I've got a bad
feeling about this!

71
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,708
I hope Goku and Tien are safe.

72
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:36,208
There's nothing here.

73
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:40,583
Not exactly a great
spot for a picnic, is it?

74
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:42,000
Hey, Yamcha?

75
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:44,375
Don't you think its too
dangerous to rush in headlong?

76
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:46,791
Maybe we should land
and go in by foot?

77
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:48,875
Yeah, you're right!

78
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:02,833
What a rip-off! I come
all this way to watch Goku

79
00:07:02,916 --> 00:07:04,833
fight and there's
no sign of him.

80
00:07:04,916 --> 00:07:08,875
Eh?! Uh. That's one big crater.

81
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,333
This doesn't look good,

82
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:16,833
and I'm not sticking around
to see if it's safe.

83
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:19,791
All this way for nothing. Hm...

84
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:24,000
Goku should have
known better than to try

85
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:27,000
and stand up to a
guy like Piccolo, anyway.

86
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:31,416
Hm. Well, I guess the poor
guy'll get what he deserves.

87
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,583
There's nothing
I can do about it!

88
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,458
Huh?!

89
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:52,625
[YAJIROBE] Wait a minute!
He owes me a dinner!

90
00:07:52,708 --> 00:07:54,833
Goku promised to treat
me to a free meal,

91
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:57,875
and he still hasn't done it yet!

92
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:09,541
Hey, hold on.
If I find Goku now,

93
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:11,125
he might be all beaten up,

94
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:14,541
then I won't get anything to eat
and my life could be in danger.

95
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:28,125
Wait a minute.
I forgot Goku drank

96
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:31,750
the Ultra Divine Water.
He won't be beaten that easily!

97
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:46,333
If Goku is still alive, I can
get that free meal from him.

98
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:49,750
That'll be all right
with me! Yeah!

99
00:08:56,708 --> 00:09:00,083
This sure was a big
explosion, that's for sure.

100
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:03,916
It's gonna be dangerous.
I'm gonna go in alone.

101
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,375
Bulma I want you and Launch to
stay here where it's safe, okay?

102
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:11,000
Uh! No way, mister! We're all
in this together, remember?

103
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:14,833
But, this is a much safer
place for you to be right now!

104
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:16,458

be tougher than that!

could overcome anything,

even pain.

127

There's no way I'd ever
wanna be anything like you.

no match against my power!

could you do that?!

can do about it.

That's what you think, buddy!

162
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:58,000
I still have one arm
left that I can use!

Good luck! I'll block it!

He did it!

174
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:49,666
I won!

175
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:53,583
[laughs] I did it!

176
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:05,208

[PICCOLO] I don't believe it.
He flew right through me!

179
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:19,500
How could he defeat
me like that?

180
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:30,666
So, I underestimated
his strength!

181
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:34,791
[gasps] He's won,
for now,  but my legacy

182
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:39,666
on this planet
will survive!

Hey, whadda ya
think is going on?

I can't see anything from here.

I still have a bad
feeling about this place.

Are you sure that
we should be here?

Yeah. Of course we should.

I always help my friends

This could get dangerous.
Piccolo's a monster!

You'd better be extra careful!

Uh. Right! Don't worry.
I'll keep my eyes peeled!

[BULMA] Hey, wait for
us Yamcha! Uh...

221
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:00,458
Hey Goku, did you know I was

222
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:03,666
thinking about going after
Piccolo myself?

223
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,958
You were? Yeah, right!

Hey! What's so
funny about that?

00:20:10,541 --> 00:20:12,583
Yeah. That's not nice.

227
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:14,958
Don't forget, Yajirobe
saved your life.

228
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:17,000
You should at least show
him some respect.

229
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:20,500
Yeah, you're right!
Sorry, Yajirobe!

230
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:22,916
No sweat. Hey why don't
you go get in my car

231
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,208
and we'll go get those
wounds fixed up!

Sure. Thanks a lot! Ah...

You okay?

234
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:37,708
I'll survive.

235
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:41,750
Listen, take care of Goku, okay?
I'm going back to Master Roshi's

236
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:44,208
to tell everyone about
what happened out here.

237
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:47,666
I'll take care of him. Sure.

[grunts] Get well soon, Goku.

Ah... Tien, what about Master
Roshi? Is it true he's gone?

240
00:20:57,791 --> 00:21:02,666
Yes, it's true. And Chiaotzu.
He's gone as well.

[GOKU]
I see...

243
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:12,666
But Goku, after watching you
fight today, you've inspired me

244
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:14,666
to train harder
than I ever have!

245
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:17,083
I can't stand that you're
so much better than me!

[laughs] The next time
we meet at the tournament,

247

I guarantee I'll
be the champion!

248
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:26,833

We'll see about that!

When you get well
come back, okay?

252
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,208
See ya later! I'll be waiting!

253
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:44,291
Sure.

254
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:49,666
See ya!

255
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:59,500
Ah. You're incredible, Goku.

[ALL gasp]

257
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,750
I think I must be going
crazy. Was that Goku?

258
00:22:24,833 --> 00:22:26,833
Yeah, it sure looked like him!

259
00:22:26,916 --> 00:22:29,166
You're kidding?!

260
00:22:30,541 --> 00:22:34,041
[NARRATOR] And so, Goku finally
defeated his rival, Piccolo,

261
00:22:34,125 --> 00:22:35,708
in a series of epic battles.

262
00:22:35,791 --> 00:22:38,458
But now, with the
Eternal Dragon gone,

263
00:22:38,541 --> 00:22:41,875
how will he get the Dragon Balls
that he so desperately needs

264
00:22:41,958 --> 00:22:45,500
to revive his friends,
Master Roshi and Krillin?

265
00:22:45,583 --> 00:22:48,041
The future is uncertain,
but you can bet there are

266
00:22:48,125 --> 00:22:50,791
new challenges on
the horizon for Goku.

267
00:22:50,875 --> 00:22:55,416
So don't miss the next
exciting episode of Dragon Ball!
