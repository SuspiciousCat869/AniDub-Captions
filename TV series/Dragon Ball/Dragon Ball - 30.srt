1
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,416
[NARRATOR] In the smoky air,
an evil plot is brewing

2
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:20,375
one as wicked as the man
who speaks it into existence.

3
00:02:20,458 --> 00:02:22,125
[screeches]

4
00:02:24,208 --> 00:02:26,625
[RED] Shhhhhh.

5
00:02:31,083 --> 00:02:32,166
[RED] Kill him.

6
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,750
[NARRATOR]
It is a beautiful day.

7
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:48,416
One that does not
go unnoticed by Goku

8
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:51,916
as he soars across the sky
aboard his Flying Nimbus.

9
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,750
New to the world,
our young hero is captivated

10
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:58,041
by the splendor of the ever-
changing landscape around him.

11
00:02:58,125 --> 00:03:01,500
However, he is about to
learn an important lesson:

12
00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:03,833
Always watch where you're going.

13
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:11,625
Whoa-AAAHH!

14
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:15,166
Uh-Uh-haa-haa-uh!

15
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:20,875
AHAHAHYEYEYEYEAHAHAH!!!!!!

16
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:27,875
Whoa-wee!

17
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:38,125
[NARRATOR] Though Goku's
quest to find his Grandfather's

18
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:41,541
Four-Star Dragon Ball is
sure to be fraught with peril,

19
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:44,000
he never forgets
to enjoy the moment

20
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:46,833
and absorb the wonders
he sees before him.

21
00:03:46,916 --> 00:03:49,291
Whether it's chasing
a herd of wild buffalo

22
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:52,666
across the open plains,
or diving into a soft nest

23
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:55,000
of fruit trees for an
afternoon snack,

24
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:59,333
Goku savors each experience
and takes nothing for granted.

25
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:00,791
Growing up in a mountain forest,

26
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:03,125
with only his grandfather
to keep him company,

27
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:05,791
Goku was isolated
from the outside world

28
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:07,500
and all it has to offer.

29
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:09,541
Both good and evil.

30
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:12,041
To him, a breadbasket is

31
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:14,250
as marvelous as
the stars in the sky;

32
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:16,000
but he has yet to realize

33
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:19,291
that it is he who
is truly extraordinary.

34
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:25,083
[GOKU] Y-u-m, y-u-ooh?
That's strange...

35
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:28,666
I wonder if this
thing is broken?

36
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:35,083
Whoa! Got one! Hahaha!

37
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,541
[roars]

38
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:49,541
[PILAF] No! Oh, no. No! Please!

39
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:57,250
Noooo!

40
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:06,333
Ahhh! Huuuh? Oh.

41
00:05:06,416 --> 00:05:07,375
Emperor Pilaf?

42
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:09,166
Sire, are you all right?

43
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:14,833
Help me... Help me!

44
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:20,666
Hey. You're safe, sire.
I'm right here.

45
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,375
Huh?!

46
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:25,791
Oh, nothing like a
good stretch on the floor

47
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:26,916
to get you really
worked up, ya know!

48
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,375
He-he-he-he-he-he-he...

49
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:30,708
It's okay, sire.
Crying is therapeutic.

50
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:35,416
I've never shed a tear
in my life, Shu! Go!

51
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,958
[SHU] But, sire!
I have good news!

52
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:38,666
We've picked up a
Dragon Ball on the radar.

53
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,625
The signal is very strong!

54
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:45,208
[SHU] It's about 150 miles away
in the Southwest.

55
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:46,250
Really?!

56
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:47,875
Uh-huh!

57
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:54,208
Are you crying again, sire?

58
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:56,958
Shu, my slipper.

59
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:58,666
Uh, here you go.

60
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:00,458
You boob!

61
00:06:00,541 --> 00:06:03,250
I was obviously laughing!

62
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:06,166
You are my true inspiration.

63
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:10,333
With you by my side,
the whole world will be mine.

64
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:12,250
Aww, I didn't know you cared...

65
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:14,625
[PILAF] I was talking
to the DRAGON!!!

66
00:06:17,791 --> 00:06:19,708
Impressive.

67
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:25,416
You dolt.

68
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:27,541
[PILAF] So, the
Dragon Balls have begun

69
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:29,791
to show up on our radar, eh?

70
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:32,958
Perfect. They're as
good as mine already.

71
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:36,541
Wake up world,
and hail your new ruler!!

72
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:41,208
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

73
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:43,083
Daah! Hold on!

74
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:45,708
[SHU] Gotcha!

75
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:54,708
[SHU] Why did you go
and open the window?!

76
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:55,916
You know you're not supposed

77
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,416
to do that when
we're up in the air!

78
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:05,208
Just-get-me-back-inside!

79
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:10,833
Shu...! Help...! Pull...! Pull!

80
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:15,208
I'm sorry I called
you a dolt! Please!!

81
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:19,750
Shu-u-u-! Wake-up, help me!

82
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:24,791
I don't wanna die-e-e-e!

83
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:28,083
Wa-a-a-a-a! Shu-u-u-u-u-u!!!

84
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:06,541
[SMELLY BOY] I wish I had
something to eat...

85
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,250
[SMELLY BOY] Yeah, well.

86
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:12,125
Lying here all day isn't
gonna make my belly full.

87
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:17,541
Guess, that means
it's time to go to work!

88
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:27,208
Ha-a-ahh!

89
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:32,625
Hahahaha! Yeah!

90
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:55,291
Boy! That was refreshing.
Huh? Wh-uh-

91
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:57,833
Where did all
my things go?!

92
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:05,458
Man, that kid was loaded!

93
00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:08,166
I bet I'll make a fortune
on all of this great stuff!

94
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:14,375
Sure is breezy up here...

95
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:16,458
[sneezes]

96
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:17,916
I gotta find my clothes.

97
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,791
And my power pole!

98
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:22,458
That's it!

99
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:28,958
Power Pole... extend!

100
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:32,791
Huh?

101
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:35,166
Ohhh!

102
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,375
Power Pole extend!

103
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:41,458
Power Pole! Can you hear me?

104
00:09:45,916 --> 00:09:47,125
[GOKU] Yeah! There it is!

105
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,583
Power Pole descend.

106
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,458
I guess whoever
took it ran away.

107
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:07,958
The dragon radar is missing.

108
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:09,666
That smell!

109
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,916
It's just like what I picked up

110
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,541
on at the pond
only much stronger.

111
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:17,500
Ohh.

112
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:22,000
E-e-e yuck!

113
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:26,166
Grandpa, if I don't
get the radar back,

114
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,916
there's no way I'll
find your Dragon Ball.

115
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:37,541
That smell might
lead me to the thief.

116
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:43,541
Guess I'll...
follow my nose.

117
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:03,708
[PILAF] Mai, are you sure there

118
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:06,375
is a Dragon Ball
somewhere around here?

119
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:07,666
[MAI] Yes, it's here.

120
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,833
But we have yet to
pinpoint its exact location.

121
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:11,791
Our radar confirms it's
within a one-mile radius

122
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:13,166
from the center of this town.

123
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:14,875
We'll find it, Sire...

124
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:16,708
It's just a matter of time.

125
00:11:16,791 --> 00:11:18,500
Time is something
we don't have.

126
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:20,041
For all we know,
someone else could be

127
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:22,500
collecting one of the
Dragon Balls as we speak.

128
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:25,083
I won't risk a repeat
of last year's disaster!

129
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:28,541
I want all 7 balls secure and
in my possession, understand?

130
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:30,250
I want nothing less
than perfection

131
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:31,958
from every member
of this organization.

132
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:34,041
Remember, if even one
of the balls is missing,

133
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:35,416
the rest are useless.

134
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,458
As will be my need for you!

135
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:45,083
[SILVER] Good afternoon.

136
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:47,541
You'll have to excuse
the temper of my men.

137
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:51,500
We've been traveling all day and
it's left them a bit irritable.

138
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,916
Mmm. Something smells good.

139
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,291
But I can't stay for dinner.

140
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:57,125
Work's got me swamped.

141
00:12:57,208 --> 00:13:00,833
You see I'm searching for
something called a Dragon Ball.

142
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,541
[SILVER] Perhaps you good people
could tell me where it is.

143
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:09,125
Before something
bad happens.

144
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:11,583
[FATHER] Please! Leave us alone!

145
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:14,875
We don't have
what you're looking for.

146
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:18,250
Really?

147
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:19,583
Pity.

148
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:22,375
It's a shame to raise
children in a broken home.

149
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:23,333
Destroy...

150
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:25,125
...everything!!

151
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:29,375
[crashing, cracking sounds]

152
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:30,750
[FATHER] Please, stop!

153
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:40,166
[SMELLY BOY] Hey, mister!

154
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:42,125
[SMELLY BOY] Hi!

155
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:43,250
Eh, you again.

156
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:45,125
Don't come any closer!
You smell.

157
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:46,291
S-o-o-o...

158
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:48,666
What do ya think'a this baby?

159
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:53,375
Pricey stuff, huh?

160
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:56,000
Hmm... Maybe, maybe not...

161
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:00,666
[SHOP KEEPER thinking] This
gizmo could be worth millions!

162
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:01,541
Whatever it is.

Hey, I'm trying
be nice here, kid!

Hello. I must say

you're making an
excellent choice today.

186

That crown is over
300 years old.

187
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:00,500
It was worn by
Alexander the Great.

00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:02,375
He built a kingdom
to the North of us.

According to this label,

his nickname must
have been Ralph.

192

It is the symbol

by many great historical
leaders, your majesty!

Why don't we step
into my parlor

It is an impressive collection.

But what I'm interested in can't
be found in any antique shop.

Ah, I see...

00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:21,208
There is one item I have that
possesses such potential...

226
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:23,750
A powerful relic.
Inherited by kings.

227
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:27,000
One after another,
for thousands of years.

[PILAF] So, if only kings
have claimed this treasure,

00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:33,333
then it is my
