I was going to give
it to General White,

he was planning

to kill all of the villagers
once he had recovered it.

experiments undisturbed.

325
00:18:13,916 --> 00:18:15,166
Is it lunchtime?

326
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:16,833
[MURASAKI giggles]

327
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:18,916
At last it's mine!

328
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,583
[SUNO shrieks]

329
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,666
That's Suno! She's in trouble!

330
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:27,541
[ALL gasp]

331
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:29,875
Sergeant Murasaki!

332
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:32,958
[MURASAKI laughs]

333
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:34,791
So long, losers!

334
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:40,375
Who went out the window?

335
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:44,208
It was Murasaki, and he took
your Dragon Balls with him.

336
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:45,541
What?!

337
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:46,666
[MURASAKI laughs]

338
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,541
[GOKU] Stop! Thief!

339
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:52,875
[MURASAKI laughs]

340
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:55,166
Just like old times,
hey, little brat?!

341
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:56,916
Come on! Eat snow!

342
00:18:58,416 --> 00:19:00,541
Hey! Come back!

343
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:16,166
[GOKU] Stop!
Give me back my stuff!

344
00:19:18,041 --> 00:19:19,458
[GOKU] Wait!

345
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:24,083
So long, shorty!

346
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:30,166
Ka-Me-Ha-Me-...

347
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:31,875
Haaa!

348
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:36,375
[MURASAKI gasps]

349
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:37,916
[MURASAKI screams]

350
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:51,333
[MURASAKI screams]

351
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:57,916
[screaming continues]

352
00:19:59,791 --> 00:20:01,166
[MURASAKI screams]

353
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:07,291
[MURASAKI screams]

354
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,833
Oh, thank goodness it's here!

355
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:20,208
I was afraid he
would eat my lunch!

356
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:26,458
Somehow, I always thought
Dragon Balls were bigger.

357
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:27,916
[BOTH] Hmm...

358
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:04,166
I did it. Zere's nothing
more to worry about.

359
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:05,083
[BOTH giggle]

360
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:06,375
--Yeah!
--All right!

361
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:07,833
[DR. FLAPPE sighs]

362
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:09,666
[gasping]

363
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:18,458
Quick hands.

364
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,458
[NUMBER 8]
I owe you my life, Doctor.

365
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:27,875
Thank you.

366
00:21:27,958 --> 00:21:30,291
--[GOKU] Thank you!
--[SUNO] Thanks, Doctor!

367
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:32,958
Yes, yes. You're welcome.

368
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:35,666
But there's one little thing...

369
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:39,333
Your radar is too sophisticated
for me to handle.

370
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:40,958
I... couldn't fix it.

371
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:41,833
That's okay.

372
00:21:41,916 --> 00:21:43,666
I'll just take it back to Bulma.

373
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,541
She'll know what
to do with it...

374
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,875
Wha...?

375
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:50,166
[ALL scream]

376
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:51,625
The bomb!

377
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,958
--So long, Bye-bye!
--Take care, Dr. Flappe.

378
00:21:57,041 --> 00:21:58,416
Bye!

379
00:21:59,791 --> 00:22:02,750
Good luck, my friends!

380
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:04,125
[DR: FLAPPE] I wish
I had ze courage

381
00:22:04,208 --> 00:22:06,208
to tell 8 that
I planted ze bomb.

382
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:07,750
I had no choice.

383
00:22:07,833 --> 00:22:10,250
Zey would have killed ze
villagers if I didn't.

384
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:11,750
[ALL] Bye!

385
00:22:11,833 --> 00:22:13,458
[DR. FLAPPE] Perhaps some day
I can tell him ze truth...

386
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:23,958
[MURASAKI gasps]

387
00:22:24,041 --> 00:22:26,458
Like the ebb and
flow of the tides,

388
00:22:26,541 --> 00:22:28,958
my wrath shall
remain constant...

389
00:22:29,041 --> 00:22:31,250
I'll have my revenge!

390
00:22:39,125 --> 00:22:40,500
[MURASAKI screams]

391
00:22:41,833 --> 00:22:45,458
[NARRATOR] It's always nice
to end a story with a bang.

392
00:22:45,541 --> 00:22:48,375
Join us next time for
another exciting adventure
