his powerful foe.

Despite the odds,
Krillin's determination

kept him in the fight,

that of a cunning warrior.

power by appearance?

Just who are you, really?

165
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:35,750
I've heard of losing graciously,
but this is ridiculous.

166
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:39,416
[HERO] You are full of
curiosity, aren't you?

167
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,875
I would be so
depressed right now.

168
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:45,333
Why should he be upset?
He fought well...

169
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:47,208
There's no shame in that.

170
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:51,708
Sure, life's great.

171
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:53,916
Yamcha did swell.

172
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,375
[ROSHI] Mm-hm. His form and
technique were astounding.

173
00:12:57,458 --> 00:13:00,458
He's turned into a fine warrior.

174
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:02,250
[YAMCHA laughs]

175
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:05,500
[sighs] It would just be nice
to see someone besides Goku

176
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:07,083
make it to the finals.

177
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:09,833
Yamcha deserves a
shot at the title.

178
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:11,625
Ah. I know what you mean.

179
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:15,791
Yamcha always gets
the toughest opponents.

180
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:19,166
[BULMA thinking]
He'll always be my champion.

181
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:20,750
[YAMCHA]
I don't mean to be pushy.

182
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,833
I'd just appreciate
knowing the identity

183
00:13:22,916 --> 00:13:25,708
of one of the greatest
opponents I've ever faced.

184
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:28,333
All will be revealed in time.

185
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:37,166
[GOKU]
I know you... Kami.

186
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:53,416
[CROWD cheering]

187
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:57,708
[JUDGE] Come on. Put your backs
into it. We don't have all day.

188
00:13:57,791 --> 00:14:02,541
Be sure it's centered.
I despise crooked tiles.

189
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:04,583
[ANNOUNCER] The ring has
seen its share of abuse

190
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:06,000
during this tournament.

191
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:08,583
But it's a small price
to pay for the excitement

192
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:10,875
and extraordinary drama

193
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:14,666
as only the World Martial
Arts Society can deliver!

194
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,291
With repairs nearly complete,

195
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:18,875
it's time to welcome
our top four athletes

196
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:20,208
to the semi-finals.

197
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:26,208
They are Tien Shinhan,
Goku, Junior, and Hero.

198
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:34,125
I think it's safe to say,
without exaggeration,

199
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:37,958
that those four men are the
world's strongest fighters.

200
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:39,916
Roshi, you sound
like a commercial.

201
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,625
Maybe you should do
the announcements.

202
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:44,291
They certainly couldn't
get any worse.

203
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:51,000
Even as I speak,
each fighter is undergoing

204
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:54,708
special preparation
for the battle ahead.

205
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:58,083
You're sweating badly, Goku.
Oops, I think I... uh...

206
00:14:58,166 --> 00:15:02,875
I appreciate your concern,
but really, that tickles.

207
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:04,416
[ANNOUNCER]
Attention semi-finalists

208
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,208
and audience alike.

209
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:09,666
It is now time for the
semi-finals to begin.

210
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:15,083
The first match will be
Tien Shinhan versus Goku...

211
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:17,291
At this time, will both fighters

212
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:19,416
please make their
way to the ring?

213
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:23,083
[CHICHI]
Goku? Have a good fight.

214
00:15:24,916 --> 00:15:26,333
Thanks.

215
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:37,833
Uh, I don't think this match
is going to be pretty.

216
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:40,666
Interesting, I wonder
how far their training

217
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,791
and enlightenment
have progressed

218
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:44,750
since their last battle.

219
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:47,750
I just hope they
both survive this...

220
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:50,125
with all their teeth intact.

221
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:52,041
[growls]

222
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:54,916
Well, if they don't break
some bones, I will.

223
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,083
[yelps]

224
00:15:57,166 --> 00:16:00,125
We don't need this aggravation.

225
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:03,375
[ANNOUNCER] The last fight these
two were in is now legendary.

226
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:05,666
That battle closed out
the previous tournament,

227
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:08,958
and brought new meaning
to the word stamina!

228
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:10,333
Tien Shinhan was the victor,

229
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:13,458
by a narrow margin...
Both men have endured

230
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:15,458
three years of
training since then,

231
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:19,958
so we can expect three times the
power, three times the danger,

232
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:22,458
and three times the excitement!

233
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:24,916
Get ready for some
serious fireworks folks!

234
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,458
Because when these
two titans clash,

235
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:30,375
there's no telling
what may happen.

236
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:38,458
I assume this is
going to be intense.

237
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:40,125
Of course.

238
00:16:53,833 --> 00:17:05,541
[CROWD cheers]

239
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:08,375
Goku's looking pretty
serious this time.

240
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:10,708
Is Tien Shinhan as
strong as he looks?

241
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:13,791
He's tremendously strong.
Just you wait.

242
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:20,666
Unlike these dullards,
I'm not so easily impressed.

243
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:23,500
[HERO thinking] Those "dullards"
might surprise you.

244
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:25,958
I've been looking
forward to this...

245
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:29,791
To be honest, I really didn't
feel like I won last time.

246
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:32,166
[GOKU laughs]

247
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:35,958

And now, let the match begin!

248

[BOTH grunting]

249
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:00,500

fight has taken flight!

Whoa! Using astounding force,

253
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:38,375
Tien Shinhan has
caught up to Goku,

254
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:41,916
and now the two are trading
punches in mid-air!

255
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:53,583
[CHICHI gasps]

In a strange twist,

258
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,791
both opponents have
gone invisible.

259
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:24,333

eerie sounds of combat!

Whoa! Tien Shinhan and

at each other's throat!

[ANNOUNCER] It doesn't get any
more exciting than this, folks!

283
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:45,583
Goku and Tien Shinhan,

284
00:21:45,666 --> 00:21:49,583
standing toe-to-toe in intense
combat. The way it looks now,

285
00:21:49,666 --> 00:21:51,916
this match could go either way.

286
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,833
Let's just hope they
don't disappear again!

287
00:21:56,916 --> 00:22:01,541
I disagree. One of them
clearly comes up short...

288
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:04,000
Tien Shinhan is facing
an uphill battle

289
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:08,041
if he thinks he can defeat
Goku with his usual tactics.

290
00:22:08,125 --> 00:22:12,041
Despite all that running around,
he hasn't even lost his breath.

291
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:15,083
Clearly he has learned
to control his energy,

292
00:22:15,166 --> 00:22:19,041
conserving just enough to
stay one step ahead of Tien.

293
00:22:19,125 --> 00:22:22,208
Such power! If I weren't
wearing glasses,

I wouldn't believe my eyes!

[NARRATOR]
What malicious plot

296
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
dose Junior have
in store for Goku?

297
00:22:30,083 --> 00:22:34,416
While Yamcha, Krillin, and
ChiChi watch with uncertainty,

298
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:39,625
Master Roshi remains convinced
that Goku will win the match.

299
00:22:39,708 --> 00:22:41,708
Will his hunch be correct,

300
00:22:41,791 --> 00:22:45,875
or will Tien over-power his
young opponent as before?

301
00:22:45,958 --> 00:22:48,541
The answers to these
questions and many more
