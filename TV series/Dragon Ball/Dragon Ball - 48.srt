1
00:02:14,458 --> 00:02:15,916
[NARRATOR] In our last episode,

2
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,250
Goku and Bulma set out to
retrieve another Dragon Ball.

3
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:23,791
This one, however, proved to be
the most challenging yet,

4
00:02:23,875 --> 00:02:27,125
as it resided
at the bottom of the ocean.

5
00:02:27,208 --> 00:02:30,125
Unphased by this
monumental obstacle,

6
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:32,625
the pair paid a visit
to Master Roshi,

7
00:02:32,708 --> 00:02:36,041
in hopes they might
borrow his submarine-jet.

8
00:02:36,125 --> 00:02:40,458
Master Roshi agreed, in exchange
for Bulma's micro-band.

9
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:45,625
[NARRATOR] Goku and Bulma
received additional assistance

10
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:47,750
from Krillin,
who not only helped them

11
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:51,833
map out their target, but
decided to join them as well.

12
00:02:51,916 --> 00:02:55,416
Together, the three explorers
face the mysterious unknown

13
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,958
that awaits them far below.

14
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:15,291
[BULMA] According to the radar,
we need to head south.

15
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:17,416
Mmm... About thirty miles.

16
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,000
You got it!

17
00:03:43,416 --> 00:03:45,291
[exhales]

18
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:51,541
[knock, knock]

19
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:52,750
[STAFF OFFICER] Hm?

20
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:54,291
[RED] Enter.

21
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:57,541
[clears throat] Excuse me.

22
00:03:57,625 --> 00:03:59,833
Commander,
General Blue has just sent in

23
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:02,541
his latest field report
regarding the island.

24
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:05,000
Apparently, it is
inhabited by an old man,

25
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:06,916
a young woman, and a turtle.

26
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Old man? Hmm... Scientist!

27
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:12,833
Details are unknown.

28
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:14,541
You're probably right, sir.

29
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:16,916
This quite possibly
could be the same scientist

30
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,875
who built the sophisticated
radar for the boy.

31
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:23,541
[RED] Hrm. What is the
position of the Dragon Balls?

32
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:24,958
No change, sir.

33
00:04:25,041 --> 00:04:28,375
Two are somewhere on the island
and one is in the ocean.

34
00:04:28,458 --> 00:04:31,208
Tell General Blue to
invade the island immediately.

35
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:33,750
Get me those Dragon Balls
and the old man.

36
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:35,875
I want him taken alive.

37
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:37,333
Yes sir!

38
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:44,000
[RED chuckles]

39
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:46,000
Checkmate.

40
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:48,375
[chuckles]

41
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:06,583
[LAUNCH humming]

42
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:08,125
[LAUNCH] Hm?

43
00:05:10,916 --> 00:05:13,333
[LAUNCH]
Hmmm... That's strange.

44
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:19,416
This is Bulma's bag.
She must have forgot it.

45
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:30,708
Aaah...

46
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:32,750
[LAUNCH] What are these?

47
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:43,166
[ROSHI laughs]
Now's my chance!

48
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:49,458
[humming]

49
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:53,750
Eeh! That was close!
This job takes stealth.

50
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:55,500
[chuckles]

51
00:05:55,583 --> 00:06:04,333
[humming]

52
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:10,916
[laughs]

53
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
[ROSHI] All right! Let's get
down to business!

54
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:23,875
Now I'll finally
get what I deserve.

55
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:27,750
[laughing]

56
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:31,458
[BULMA] Okay, we should be
right above it.

57
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:32,458
Dive here.

58
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:33,916
[KRILLIN] Gotcha.

59
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:37,833
You mean we're really
going underneath the water

60
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:39,416
with this thing?

61
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,250
Yeah. That's the plan!

62
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:43,250
Wow, neat!

63
00:07:06,541 --> 00:07:08,333
That's it, find the ball...

64
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:10,166
so I can steal it from you.

65
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,166
[laughs]

66
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:19,541
Roger. I'll tell
General Blue, immediately.

67
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,416
Gen--aah!

68
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,875
Aah!

69
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:30,958
Now, how many times will it
take until you've learned?

70
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:33,333
It is very difficult
to sneak up behind a general

71
00:07:33,416 --> 00:07:35,291
and keep your teeth.

72
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,916
Sorry, General, urgent message.

73
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,833
[BLUE] Well? What is it?!

74
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:43,458
[SOLDIER A] Sir, we've received
official confirmation

75
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:45,791
from headquarters
regarding the boy's hideout.

76
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:48,708
According to radar reports,
the boy's Dragon Balls

77
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:50,583
are on that island
as we thought.

78
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:52,166
We've been ordered
to steal the Dragon Balls

79
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:55,291
and capture the old scientist
for questioning.

80
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:58,083
Everything is happening
as I had envisioned it...

81
00:07:58,166 --> 00:07:59,333
[laughs]

82
00:07:59,416 --> 00:08:02,500
That boy's days are
numbered... Attention!

83
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:03,583
Sir!

84
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:05,041
Divide the corps
into two units.

85
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:06,916
I will lead company A's
attack on the boy,

86
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,416
while you mobilize company B
and take the island.

87
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,416
Aside from the old man,
no prisoners.

88
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,666
[BLUE] Is that understood?!

89
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,750
Yes, sir!

90
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:20,333
Lieutenant. This army
requires its soldiers to move.

91
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:22,625
[BLUE] Lose some weight.

92
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:24,541
Yes, sir...

93
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:36,708
[GOKU] Wow! Everything
looks so beautiful!

94
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:54,375
Huh...

95
00:08:59,291 --> 00:09:02,083
[GOKU] Bulma, why does
that big fish look so sad?

96
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:03,375
What's its name?

97
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:06,375
I don't know.
Be quiet, I'm trying to think.

98
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:07,666
Stop here, Krillin!

99
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:10,041
The radar shows it
should be right beneath us!

100
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:11,500
[KRILLIN] Right.

101
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:10,041
[GOKU] Where is it?

102
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:12,750
All I see down there
is a bunch of pretty fish.

103
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:14,208
[BULMA]
It's down there somewhere.

104
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:17,250
The radar doesn't lie.
Why don't you go look for it?

105
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:19,208
[GOKU] Okay.

106
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:20,666
Oh...

107
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,125
No wonder that fish is so sad.

108
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:26,583
All he can see is blue.

109
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:28,625
That's nice, bye. [chuckles]

110
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:44,000
[yells, laughs]

111
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:46,041
[KRILLIN]
What's the matter with Goku?

112
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:48,000
[laughing]

113
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:49,750
Uh?

114
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:52,125
[GOKU] This one must
be called a tickle fish.

115
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:53,958
[chuckles] Neat.

116
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:57,916
What are you doing?!
Stop goofing off!

117
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,041
Wow! How did your voice
get in my helmet?

118
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:06,875
[BULMA] Goku?!

119
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:10,333
Uh! Goku, what's going on?
Did you find it?

120
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:18,083
Uh...

121
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:20,083
Hey guys! Look at this!

122
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:22,875
It's the biggest crab
I've ever seen in my whole life!

123
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:24,375
[laughs]

124
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:27,708
Would you quit playing around
and find the Dragon Ball!

125
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:34,000
[BLUE]
We stand at the crossroads

126
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:36,208
between success and greatness.

127
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:38,416
Those who stand before me
represent the best that

128
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,458
the Red Ribbon Army
has to offer.

129
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:43,041
Your deeds
are already legendary.

130
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:44,875
But your actions today
will determine

131
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:47,583
how that legend is to be told.

132
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:49,791
[BLUE]
Find your enemy. Pluck him out.

133
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:54,208
And let his bones
pave the way to your glory!

134
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:08,583
[BLUE] Fail yourselves,
but never fail me.

135
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:15,583
[chuckles]
Bring me the old man.

136
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:18,083
For those who
help him, no mercy!

137
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:19,750
[BLUE] Now scramble!

138
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:26,791
[sirens]

139
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:43,791
[INTERCOM] All troops
report to battle stations!

140
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:46,541
All troops
report to battle stations!

141
00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:49,125
Repeating! All trops report--

142
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:32,625
[BULMA] Any luck?! You should
be right on top of it.

143
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:35,916
[GOKU] Nothing here
but sea fish and coral.

144
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,875
This is strange.
Maybe the radar is acting up.

145
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:42,416
Uh. Guh.

146
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,916
[GOKU] Look! There's a
big crack in the ground.

147
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
It seems deep. Do you think
maybe the Dragon Ball

148
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:01,000
could have
dropped down inside of it?

149
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:03,708
[KRILLIN] Wait a minute!

150
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:06,333
Let me guide the submarine jet
down there and investigate.

151
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:11,250
[BULMA] If Goku's right,
this might be more difficult

152
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:13,958
than I thought. I need to
adjust the search grid

153
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:16,500
to compensate for
the depth differential.

154
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:19,208
[KRILLIN] Uh, yeah... O-Okay...

155
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:22,000
You mean, closer to the wall?

156
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:25,000
Yes. Closer to the wall, okay?

157
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:29,166
[beeping]

158
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:32,625
Goku, I... I think you're
gonna want to come see this.

159
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:35,500
I'd like to, but I
don't think I can fit...

160
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:38,583
I think we need the machine
you gave to Master Roshi,

161
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:41,833
the one that makes you smaller.

162
00:14:41,916 --> 00:14:44,958
Uh! Wait... a... sec...

163
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:46,291
What's up?

164
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:47,750
[BULMA] Judging by
the shape of the ditch,

165
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:49,750
it looks like
it leads to something.

166
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:50,875
[gasps]

167
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:52,416
[BULMA]
I'll switch radar magnification

168
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,416
and see if I can't
get a better view.

169
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:59,791
[BULMA] There, see?!
It's a cave of some sort.

170
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:01,375
Maybe we can get inside!

171
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:03,541
It might lead
to the Dragon Ball!

172
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:05,125
We can go in there?

173
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:07,750
[BULMA] Come back to the sub
so we can check it out.

174
00:15:07,833 --> 00:15:18,333
[sirens]

175
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:19,791
Start your engines!

176
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:29,833
[sirens continue]

177
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,666
[SOLDIER Z]
Attention all personnel--

178
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,250
secure stations
and prepare to dive!

179
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:06,083
I repeat, secure stations
and prepare to dive!

180
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:15,166
[SOLDIER B] All hatches secure!

181
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:18,083
[SOLDIER B] All systems are go!
We're ready to dive!

182
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:32,625
Take us down.

183
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:59,208
So, what kind of
opposition are we looking at

184
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:01,125
once we reach the island, sir?

185
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:02,791
[chuckles]

186
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:06,041
[DOCK] Just a woman
and old man, so I hear.

187
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:07,500
[chuckles]

188
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:19,416
[ROSHI] Mmmm...

189
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,375
Eh! What in the world
is taking her so long?

190
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:25,333
Eh. Oh! She's here!

191
00:17:25,416 --> 00:17:32,958
[LAUNCH humming]

192
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:34,541
[laughs]

193
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:35,791
[LAUNCH] Here we go.

194
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:37,250
Aah!

195
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:53,666
[yelling]

196
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,625
No! Stop! Wait!

197
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:57,750
[ROSHI yelling]

198
00:17:57,833 --> 00:18:01,333
Launch! Stop! Aah! Wait!

199
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:04,166
This sucks! [yells]

200
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:07,250
Hello? Huh?

201
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:31,458
Sir, we have a visual
on the enemy submarine.

202
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:34,583
General, we have them
within weapons range.

203
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:36,541
Perfect.
Hold your fire, Captain,

204
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:38,208
but keep them
locked in your sights.

205
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:41,041
We'll just let them
lead us to the prize.

206
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:44,458
[BULMA] Go straight ahead
just a little farther.

207
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:48,375
We should see the entrance
just beyond this ridge...

208
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:51,875
There it is! We found it!
We're almost there!

209
00:18:57,583 --> 00:18:59,041
General Blue, sir!

210
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:02,333
It appears that the enemy sub
is headed inside that cave.

211
00:19:02,416 --> 00:19:04,625
[BLUE] That must be where
the Dragon Ball is hidden!

212
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:07,708
Ha-ha! Now,
blow them out of the water!

213
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:09,166
Aye, aye, sir!

214
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,166
Fire the torpedoes!

215
00:19:17,708 --> 00:19:19,291
[SOLDIER F] Torpedoes away.

216
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:38,625
[ALL yell]

217
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:43,583
Sir, we missed.

218
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:46,333
No excuses.
Fire another round immediately!

219
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:47,166
[BULMA and GOKU wail]

220
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:48,708
What's going on?!

221
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:50,375
Oh no! Look!

222
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:52,041
There's another
submarine behind us!

223
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:53,458
They fired at us!

224
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:55,875
I don't think
they're too friendly!

225
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:58,166
There's only one group
mean enough to do this...

226
00:19:58,250 --> 00:19:59,833
the Army!

227
00:19:59,916 --> 00:20:01,041
Huh?!

228
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:05,000
Army? You don't mean the...
Red Ribbon Army?

229
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:07,541
That's them...
I know the Red Ribbon Army

230
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:10,833
has been looking for the Dragon
Balls just as hard as I have.

231
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:13,416
But they're much more
dangerous and mean about it.

232
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,791
[yells]

233
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:17,916
Mean?! I'd say trying
to blow us into fish food

234
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,291
borders on psychotic!

235
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:21,333
Why didn't you tell me
you were expecting company?

236
00:20:21,416 --> 00:20:24,083
I never would have signed up
for this crazy mission!

237
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:25,583
Fire away!

238
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:32,416
They're firing on us again!

239
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,541
Okay, now would be
a good time to move!

240
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:45,083
Negative impact! I'm afraid
we missed them again, sir!

241
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:47,666
No, you missed them!

242
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:50,208
Soldier, execute this fool!
I grow tired of him!

243
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:51,375
Sir!

244
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:52,583
[SOLDIER C]
No, no, no, please! C'mon!

245
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:53,958
I've got a wife and
two cubs at home, man!

246
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:55,916
I gotta pay
the electric bill and--

247
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
[thud]

248
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:09,625
[BULMA] Faster!
We've gotta go faster!

249
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:10,958
[KRILLIN] I'm going!

250
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:12,666
[BULMA] Would it help
if I got out and pushed?!

251
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:15,458
At this point
I'm willing to try anything!

252
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:17,666
This is serious!
Why didn't you tell us

253
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,583
these guys were after you?!

254
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:22,500
No one ever asked me
about the Red Ribbon Army.

255
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,166
Ready torpedoes for launch.

256
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:43,166
We may be in luck.
The cave is getting narrow.

257
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:46,208
Faster! Hurry up! Just go!

258
00:21:50,708 --> 00:21:53,541
[BULMA and KRILLIN yell, laugh]

259
00:21:53,958 --> 00:21:55,125
[KRILLIN] We did it!

260
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:57,541
Their ship is too big
to follow us in here!

261
00:22:01,041 --> 00:22:02,333
[laughs]

262
00:22:02,416 --> 00:22:05,500
Those simple fools think
they've found a safe haven.

263
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:08,916
Prepare the escape pods!
We're going after them!

264
00:22:17,791 --> 00:22:19,166
Engage!

265
00:22:26,583 --> 00:22:30,125
[laughs] Idiots!

266
00:22:30,208 --> 00:22:32,625
They are playing
right into my hands!

267
00:22:32,708 --> 00:22:38,166
[laughs intensely]

268
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:41,166
[NARRATOR] Our heroes are well
on their way to discovering

269
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:44,791
the secret lying deep
within this mysterious cave.

270
00:22:44,875 --> 00:22:48,541
All they have to do is
survive long enough to reach it.

271
00:22:48,625 --> 00:22:52,333
Don't miss the next incredible
episode of Dragon Ball!
