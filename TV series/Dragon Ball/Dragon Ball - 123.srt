[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball,

2
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:17,333
a damaged, but determined Goku,

3
00:02:17,416 --> 00:02:20,166
summoned one, last
powerful punch,

4
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,833
and put a super
sized hole in Piccolo!

--[GOKU yelling]
--[PICCOLO groans]

6
00:02:26,458 --> 00:02:29,916
[NARRATOR] This daring attack
sealed Piccolo's fate for good.

7
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:34,000
[GOKU]
I won!

8
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:36,791
[NARRATOR] But Piccolo wasn't
about to lose the battle

9
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:38,500
and just walk away.

10
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:43,708
He had something special to
leave behind for planet Earth.

11
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:47,583
[PICCOLO]
Good luck, my son.

12
00:02:47,666 --> 00:02:52,916
Get revenge for my demise.
Destroy all of my enemies.

[groaning]

14
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:59,666
[NARRATOR] The defeated
demon went out with a bang,

15
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,708
and sent Goku into a tailspin.

16
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:04,625
Luckily, Yajirobe was there
to catch him before he hit

17
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:06,583
the ground. The battle was over,

18
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:09,125
but Goku soon learned
that his dearest friends

19
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:11,833
had become victims
of Piccolo's madness.

20
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:13,291
[GOKU]
What about Master Roshi?

21
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:15,416
Is it true he's gone?

22
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,625
[TIEN]
Yes, it's true.

23
00:03:16,708 --> 00:03:19,291
And Chaiotzu as well.

24
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:20,791
[GOKU]
The Eternal Dragon?

25
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:22,750
[NARRATOR] With no way of
summoning the Eternal Dragon,

26
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:26,041
will Goku be forced to accept
the loss of his closest friends?

27
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:36,416
Bye.

28
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,250

[YAMCHA]
I'm not sure.

37
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:22,125
We'd better move in
and get a closer look.

38
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,333
That looked a lot like Goku in
that air car that just flew by.

39
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:30,000
So do you think he beat Piccolo?

I guess that Piccolo was a
pretty tough fighter, wasn't he?

53
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:05,875
He demolished a
whole city by himself.

54

And you won. Mm.

So Goku won the battle?

defeated. Piccolo is dead!

But how can that be?

Who in the world is
powerful enough to do that?

00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:03,333
[GOKU]
Look at me!

166
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:08,875
I'm cured! Ha! Yeah, I feel
great! I'm good! I'm great!

167
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:09,916
[GOKU laughs]

168
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:14,333
And a- one, two, three...

169
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:16,833
[KORIN] Those Senzu Beans
really did the trick, huh?

170
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:20,958
I'm beginning to understand how

171
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:23,666
you were able to beat
Piccolo on your own.

172
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,625
The way you've recovered
from your injuries

173
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:28,125
is truly remarkable, Goku.

174
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:31,000
Master Korin, didn't you let
Piccolo go because you were

175
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:33,916
afraid you'd lose to him if
you fought him yourself?

176
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,958
Uh... I, uh...

177
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,000
Well, to be completely honest,

178
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:43,541
I thought the odds would be
better if Goku fought Piccolo

179
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:44,958
instead of me.

180
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:46,708
I'm glad things turned out
the way they did, though.

181
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:48,208
You fought an impressive battle.

182
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:50,791
You really should
be happy to be alive.

183
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:53,416
Wow.

184
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,583
What else could I do?

185
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:56,125
Goku was our only hope,

186
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:58,375
and if he lost the fight that
would mean it'd be up to me

187
00:11:58,458 --> 00:11:59,666
to take care of things.

188
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:03,500
[GOKU]
Mm?

189
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:05,250
It was all part of my plan.

190
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:08,583
Someone had to be around to
collect all the Dragon Balls.

191
00:12:08,666 --> 00:12:10,875
My boy, had you of lost,
I'da revived you,

192
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:13,583
as well as everyone else
destroyed by Piccolo.

193
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:17,500
So Master Korin, you knew about
the Dragon Balls the whole time?

194
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:22,166
[grunts] Of course I did.
You see, I know everything.

195
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:23,791
Then I guess it's no big secret

196
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:27,208
if I tell you the Eternal
Dragon was killed by Piccolo?

197
00:12:27,291 --> 00:12:28,500
What did you say?

198
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:49,625
No, really? The Eternal
Dragon is no more?

199
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:56,875
Oh, no. I never thought
Piccolo was strong enough

200
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:59,291
to do something like that.

201
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:00,958
It's not fair!

202
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:03,125
If the Eternal Dragon
was alive today,

203
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:06,333
he could bring
everyone back to life.

204
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:09,458
There's nothing you can do
about it, Goku. Just let it go.

205
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:11,833
People are always getting
into trouble all the time.

206
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:14,833
It can't be stopped.
That's just the way it is.

207
00:13:14,916 --> 00:13:16,041
[KORIN]
Mm-hm.

208
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:18,833
Yes, it's quite correct,
but don't forget,

209
00:13:18,916 --> 00:13:20,916
those people who were
attacked by Piccolo

210
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,666
must spend eternity all alone,

211
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:25,125
and will never be able
to rest in peace.

212
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:26,708
[gasps]

213
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:29,000
It's true. There is no way for
them to go to the other world

214
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:32,625
because their lifeless
bodies float in limbo.

215
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:35,250
The poor souls'll
be lost forever,

216
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:37,541
unless they are revived
by the Dragon Balls.

217
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:43,625
That's good to know.

218
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:46,291
I'm glad Piccolo didn't get me.

219
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:47,500
That's terrible!

220
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:49,250
My friends are going
to be miserable forever,

221
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:51,625
and there is nothing we can do?

222
00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:53,083
That's right.

223
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,833
There is nothing we can do
now that the dragon's gone.

224
00:13:58,875 --> 00:14:03,500
No! Hold on, I think we
might have a chance left.

225
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:05,625
[BOTH gasp]

226
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:07,125
Are you sure?

227
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:10,166
I can't believe I could forget
such an important thing.

228
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,666
Yes, this might just work.

229
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,541
Great. What do we do?

230
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:15,125
It's simple,

231
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:17,250
you just have to meet the one
who created the Dragon Balls,

232
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:20,541
and ask him to bring the
Eternal Dragon back to life.

233
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:24,125
You mean a person actually
created the Dragon Balls?

234
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:25,708
Of course, silly.

235
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,625
It's not like they just appeared
out of thin air on their own.

236
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:28,708
[KORIN]
It's true.

237
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:30,583
So who is it?

238
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:32,875
You mean you don't
know who made them?

239
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:36,291
It was Kami, of course.

240
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,625
Who's he?

241
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:40,291
Hey, what's the deal?
Is this some kind of joke?

242
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:42,625
I thought you really
wanted to help us.

243
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:45,625
Instead, you make
up some crazy story.

244
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:47,916
So all I have to do
is meet this Kami guy,

245
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,375
and he'll revive my friends?

246
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:50,458
[YAJIROBE]
Hey, Goku.

247
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:51,708
[GOKU grunts]

248
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:54,083
Come on, you know this
Kami guy doesn't exist.

249
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:55,583
He's just make believe.

250
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:58,458
Korin's just pullin'
your leg, that's all.

251
00:14:58,541 --> 00:15:00,916
Oh, he exists all right.
But if you want to meet him,

252
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,041
you must be strong
and pure of heart.

253
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:05,500
Only a chosen few have
proven worthy enough

254
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:07,583
to have a personal
meeting with Kami.

255
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:10,041
[KORIN]
Hello!

256
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:11,291
Yeah?

257
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:14,166
Goku, you have earned
this right to meet Kami,

258
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:16,791
whereas Yajirobe has not!

259
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:18,333
Who cares?

260
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:21,416
That's great! So when do
I get to go and meet him?

261
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,416
[KORIN] Kami is here,
on top of this temple.

262
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,000
[GOKU gasps]

263
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:29,875
No way! He's up here? Come on.
This is the top of the temple.

264
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:32,833
[KORIN] Well, Kami is floating
high above the tower.

265
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:35,791
And when I say floating
high up in the sky,

266
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:39,083
I mean really high,
smarty-pants!

267
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:41,166
Is this another one of your
practical jokes, Korin?

268
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:42,250
You're not fooling me.

269
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:43,750
There's nobody
floating up there.

270
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:45,875
[GOKU]
Yeah, I don't see anything.

271
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:47,916
[KORIN]
You'll just have to trust me.

272
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:51,833
Good! All I have
to do is fly up there.

273
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:56,083
[KORIN] That's impossible. You
can't go any higher than this.

274
00:15:56,166 --> 00:15:57,916
Ah. I bet he could get up there

275
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,708
pretty fast on the
back of a rocket ship.

276
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:02,125
[laughs]

277
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:03,500
Oh, no, that won't work either.

278
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,166
Even if you took a
rocket up there,

279
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:07,125
I know Kami would send
it back right away.

280
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:09,416
He doesn't like to be disturbed.

281
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,916
Okay. So, I'm stuck here,

282
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
unless there's another
way up to the top?

283
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:16,625
[KORIN chuckles]

284
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:19,000
Oh Goku, you already
have a way to get there,

285
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:21,416
and you don't even
know it, do ya?

286
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,500
Remember you have that very
special Power Pole of yours?

287
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:26,416
Use it, and it'll
take you to Kami.

288
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,458
Use my Power Pole?

289
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:30,666
The Power Pole was
originally created

290
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:33,291
to get the owner from
Earth to this temple.

291
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:34,875
You see, a long time ago,

292
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:36,625
Master Roshi begged me
to lend it to him,

293
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:38,583
so I let him have it.

294
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:40,083
I thought he'd be the last.

295
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,708
I didn't think anyone else
would be qualified to carry it,

296
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:43,958
until you came along.

297
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:47,125
I see. I never realized
it was that important,

298
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:49,833
but it was a big help
when I fought Piccolo.

299
00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:51,583
I'd better hold on to it.

300
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:55,458
[GOKU]
Uh, uh... Hey! It's gone.

301
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:57,958
[gasps]

302
00:16:58,041 --> 00:16:59,541
Where'd it go?

303
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:00,916
I know what happened to it.

304
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,375
You dropped it when
you fought Piccolo.

305
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:04,500
You're right!

306
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:07,750
Flying Nimbus!

307
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:13,583
[KORIN]
Find that Power Pole, Goku!

308
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:17,125
It's the only way to get Kami.
I'm counting on you.

309
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:20,000
Mm. Don't worry. I'm gonna
find it, Master Korin.

310
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:21,666
No matter what it takes.

311
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:26,541
[GOKU thinking]
I never knew my Power Pole

312
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:28,083
had such a secret past.

313
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:46,291
So, King, what are
you going to do now?

314
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:48,750
The first thing will
be to rebuild the city,

315
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:50,541
and then next, the castle.

316
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:52,083
After that, you'll
have to wait and see.

317

[REPORTER A]
Uh, King, do you know

319
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:58,541
the identity of the boy
who defeated Piccolo?

320
00:17:58,625 --> 00:18:00,458
[REPORTER B]
Yeah, who is he?

Uh, the boy? Ah...

What is that? Is that a cloud?

Oh, I'm so glad
you could come.

328
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:20,666
I've been looking
forward to meeting you.

329
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:23,375
Sir, have you seen
my Power Pole?

00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:25,333
Power Pole?

00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:27,416
Yeah it's about this long.

00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,000
[KING]
Do you know anything about this?

333
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:32,750
We haven't found anything like
that. Everything was destroyed.

334
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:34,208
There's nothing left but ashes.

335
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:36,250
It must have disintegrated
in the blast.

336
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,500
So that boy is the one
who defeated Piccolo?

337
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:44,000
[KING] Yes! We all owe him
a great big thank you.

you going? Come back!

So that's what happened.

Can you help me find
my Power Pole, Baba?

Please, I'll do anything to get
it back. You just gotta help me.

So I see.

You want me to find this
Power Pole that helped

you defeat Piccolo,
is that right?

Don't get your hopes up,
I just got this out of the shop.

Right. I'm getting a vision.

364

It's getting clearer,
and clearer. A-ha!

365

Oh, it's his house. That's where
you'll find your Power Pole.

I still can't believe it,
a kid like that saved the world.

And now he gets to meet
Kami face to face?

370
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:21,666
I guess it's true, some
people are just born lucky.

I know what you mean.

You found it.

You dropped it while you
were fighting Piccolo,

so I grabbed it and
brought it back here.

use this to meet Kami,
