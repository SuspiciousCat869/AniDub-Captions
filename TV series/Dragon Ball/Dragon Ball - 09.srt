1
00:02:37,208 --> 00:02:40,041
[GOKU] Boy, this
place is really strange.

2
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:41,375
[BULMA] Isn't there
supposed to be a town

3
00:02:41,458 --> 00:02:43,291
around here somewhere, Oolong?

4
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:45,208
I don't know.
I've never been in this

5
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:46,958
neck of the woods before!

6
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:49,166
[beeping]

7
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:53,041
Oh no! We're
just about on empty, guys!

8
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:56,416
[BULMA] Oh great! We should've
filled up at that last town!

9
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,625
[OOLONG] We were going
to, but some 'dumb bunny'

10
00:02:58,708 --> 00:03:01,291
insisted we were almost there.

11
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:02,791
Hey, don't blame me!

12
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:06,000
Watch it!
I'm trying to drive!

13
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:07,750
[BULMA] You're not
trying hard enough!

14
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:11,541
Hey! What are you doing?
Keep your eyes on the road!

15
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:14,166
[OOLONG] Great! Just what
I need, a backseat driver!

16
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:15,625
[BULMA] At least I
know how to drive!

17
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:17,833
[OOLONG] Yeah!
You're driving me crazy!

18
00:03:17,916 --> 00:03:18,916
[BULMA] Look out!

19
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,833
[screaming]

20
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:25,083
[GOKU] Ha ha! That was fun!

21
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:27,333
[BULMA] Fun? I
could've been killed!

22
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:29,750
Ha! Hear that?

23
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:32,416
What a bunch of clowns, huh?
They're gonna lead us right to

24
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,916
that last Dragon Ball!

25
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,041
Yeah!

26
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:36,250
[BULMA] Keep your
hands on the wheel!

27
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:37,666
[OOLONG] Keep your
hands on your mouth!

28
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,458
[BULMA] You were
picking your snout again!

29
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:41,541
What a pretty voice.

30
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:47,750
Did I say pretty
voice? I, uh meant to say

31
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:49,166
she has a pretty face.

32
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:51,583
No, no, I mean, I said she
has a pretty--No, I didn't

33
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:56,333
mean to say pretty at all.
I don't know what I meant.

34
00:03:58,416 --> 00:04:01,125
[PUAR] Here! I think you
need to cool off, Yamcha.

35
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,750
[gulping]

36
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:10,083
That hit the spot!

37
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:13,041
[OOLONG] Was not!

38
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:14,125
[BULMA] I saw you!

39
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,583
[OOLONG] Was not!

40
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:38,125
See, I was right after all,
Oolong!

41
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:40,375
"See, I was right after all."

42
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:45,250
[gasps]

43
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,125
[GOKU] Hello there!

44
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:52,041
[screaming]

45
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,708
Golly!

46
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:57,291
[OOLONG] That's the way
it happens sometimes, kid.

47
00:04:57,625 --> 00:04:59,333
[BULMA] Maybe for you it does.

48
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:00,291
[OOLONG] Who asked you?

49
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:02,375
Hello, can I--

50
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:05,166
[OOLONG] Fill her up, please.

51
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,666
[GOKU] Hey, Bulma!

52
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:15,416
These people all seem
scared of you for some reason.

53
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:18,708
[BULMA] It's not every day they
get to see a beautiful stranger.

54
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:20,166
[BULMA] Ha, I'm going shopping!

55
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:24,625
I wonder if they sell
Dyno Caps in this town.

56
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:31,208
[BULMA] Goku was right.

57
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:33,833
[BULMA] These people here
really are scared of me.

58
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:35,333
Creepy!

59
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:39,125
[BULMA] Ah-ha! Here
we go! Dyno Caps!

60
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:44,291
There you go,
it's full to the brim!

61
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:46,583
Can you wait just a minute?
Our friend's gonna be

62
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:48,833
right back with some cash.

63
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:51,333
Oh no, no, no,
that's okay!

64
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:53,500
It is on my house!

65
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:56,958
[giggling]

66
00:06:00,541 --> 00:06:02,375
[BULMA] You certainly
have a wide selection here.

67
00:06:04,083 --> 00:06:06,958
Well, do you
have any XB6's?

68
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:08,750
Yes, and sevens.

69
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:12,208
Alright then... I'll
take two of those there...

70
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:14,125
[BULMA] And three XB7's please.

71
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:15,666
[SHOP KEEP] Yes, whatever
you wish. Here you are,

72
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,125
please take them!

73
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:19,291
Well, I guess that's
all I'll be needing today.

74
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:20,875
So, how much?

75
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:23,958
No! Nothing!
Please, just take them!

76
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:25,416
Oh?

77
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:28,833
[screaming]

78
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:31,291
Talk about a bargain!
There are some expensive

79
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:34,541
Dyno Caps, and I managed
to get them all for free!

80
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:36,750
You know, I sure am glad
some people know how to

81
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:38,875
treat a beautiful
stranger like me!

82
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:50,333
[YAMCHA] It sure is taking
them a long time to get gas!

83
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,500
[screaming]

84
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:01,958
[brakes squealing]

85
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:04,875
[RABBIT A] Bah! This
town is so boring.

86
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:07,208
[RABBIT B] Why don't
we stir things up around here?

87
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:08,708
[RABBIT A] Sounds good to me.

88
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:14,583
[BULMA They're not really my
style, but they're comfortable.

89
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,958
I guess they'll have to do.

90
00:07:19,666 --> 00:07:22,375
Anything's better than that
dumb bunny outfit I was wearing.

91
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:27,416
Whoa, I almost
forgot about these.

92
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:32,125
[BULMA] Here!
That's a good look for you.

93
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:34,916
What? You mean
you're not a member of

94
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
the Rabbits, young lady?

95
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:39,833
The Rabbits?
What's that?

96
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:41,666
[MAN] Get out of here!

97
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:42,791
--Man!
--And stay out!

98
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:45,166
How dare you play
such a dirty trick?!

99
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:51,708
Now, for some reason,
nobody's even looking at me.

100
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:54,125
And they're definitely
don't look scared anymore.

101
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:00,958
Hey, Puar,
here comes that girl.

102
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:05,208
Hey guys! I got
some really great stuff here.

103
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:06,416
[GOKU] I hope you
got some food in there.

104
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,000
I'm starving!

105
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:09,958
[OOLONG] Food? Are you kiddin'?
Those bags are full of make-up

106
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:11,416
and clothes, buddy.

107
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:18,375
[RABBIT A] Yuck! These
apples are rotten!

108
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:22,250
Hey!
We've been ripped off!

109
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:24,416
You heard him!
We want our money back!

110
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,125
But you got them free!

111
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:27,875
[RABBIT A] You
don't hear so good!

112
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:30,416
He said we want our money back!

113
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,000
[MAN] Here, here!
Please, forgive!

114
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:37,583
[BOY] Mama!

115
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:42,208
[RABBIT B] Hey! Don't you
know that no one's supposed

116
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:44,458
to cross the path of a Rabbit?!

117
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:46,708
Yes! I'm sorry,
but he's just a boy,

118
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:49,000
he doesn't know any better!

119
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:52,958
[RABBIT B] Here's a
lesson he'll remember!

120
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:57,666
Holy cow!
These goons are serious!

121
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,958
So they're the Rabbits!

122
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:05,833
Look, buddy.
There's a new chick in town!

123
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:11,750
[RABBIT A] How do
you like them apples?

124
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:15,500
[RABBIT B] My, my, my.

125
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:17,791
Hey there, pretty lady, how'd
you like to spend some time

126
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:20,916
with a couple of real
men? Yes, maybe?

127
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,041
Why? Have you seen any?

128
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:25,916
You must be new in town
if you're dumb enough to

129
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,125
talk to the Rabbits like that!

130
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:30,291
[RABBIT B] Maybe we should
teach her some manners?

131
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:32,875
[BULMA] If anyone has
anything to learn, it's you

132
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:35,041
two Cro-Magnon morons!

133
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:36,750
[BULLMA] Grown
men in rabbit ears!

134
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:40,083
Ha! Can you believe
these two idiots?

135
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:44,166
[BULMA] Come on, you
guys. We're leaving.

136
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,916
[RABBIT B] Hold it.

137
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:52,500
What's the big hurry, toots?
The party's just starting!

138
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:54,750
[RABBIT B] Yes, maybe.

139
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:59,333
Goku, these bad men
need to be taken care of

140
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:01,791
or they might hurt us.

141
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:03,916
Oh, okay.

142
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:07,458
Wait!
Goku's no match for a pistol!

143
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,833
Yeah!
He's gonna "take care" of us.

144
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:13,833
Frightening, isn't he?
Little pipsqueak.

145
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:24,125
[RABBIT B] Oh my, I hope
he doesn't hurt us too bad!

146
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:25,583
[RABBIT A] Yeah!

147
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:28,000
[RABBIT B] What the--?

148
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:29,958
[shots firing]

149
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:36,875
[blows landing]

150
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:41,416
[BULMA] One down and one to go!

151
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:43,750
Hey, kid!

152
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:52,958
[screaming]

153
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:04,708
I don't think
those guys are gonna

154
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:06,916
hurt anyone now, Bulma.

155
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,166
You're right!
Thanks to you!

156
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:12,000
[OOLONG] Hmph! I
coulda done that.

157
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:14,583
Ha!

158
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:16,083
Those guys didn't know what they
were getting themselves into.

159
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:23,708
Now you've done it!
You've insulted the Rabbits,

160
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:26,791
and you're gonna pay
big time for this, kid!

161
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:28,791
No, he didn't
insult the Rabbits.

162
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:31,000
He just beat them up!

163
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:33,833
Boss, this is Rabbit One!

164
00:11:33,916 --> 00:11:35,458
Come to town, pronto!

165
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:37,625
[gasping]

166
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:39,958
We got ourselves a
troublemaker down here.

167
00:11:41,416 --> 00:11:44,583
[screaming]

168
00:11:44,666 --> 00:11:47,250
A curse on you! Thanks
to you, the boss is coming!

169
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:57,875
[doors slamming]

170
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:05,916
[GOKU] Whoa?

171
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,791
[OOLONG] I got a nose
for trouble, guys, and this

172
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:11,000
place stinks! I tell ya
something bad is gonna happen!

173
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:12,666
I knew we never
should have stopped here.

174
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,541
I wanted to keep going!

175
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:17,708
[BULMA] Oolong, you did not! We
came here for gas, remember?!

176
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,750
[OOLONG] Fine, we
got our gas, let's go!

177
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:03,666
Well, nothing's happening.

178
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:07,666
[OOLONG] Listen, I
say we get out of here

179
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,125
before something does happen.

180
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:14,250
Well, I'm not going to let
a couple of goons wearing

181
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:16,125
rabbit ears scare me away!

182
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:17,291
[groaning]

183
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:19,166
Hey, get up!
You're okay.

184
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:21,500
[RABBIT B] Oh, but it hurts...

185
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:23,833
[RABBIT A] Don't worry. The
boss is coming, and he'll do

186
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:26,208
his special thing
to those intruders!

187
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:29,041
"Special thing"?

188
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:31,750
Hey, what's this
"special thing"?

189
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:34,291
[RABBIT A] Just a little trick
our boss does to entertain.

190
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:37,083
So stick around
and enjoy the show.

191
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:39,791
[RABBIT B] Don't worry,
he's not going to turn

192
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:41,708
you into a carrot, or anything!

193
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:46,083
I don't like carrots.

194
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:49,250
Hey!
Let's get out of here, Goku!

195
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:51,250
I wanna stay and see
what everyone around here

196
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:52,958
is so scared of.

197
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,250
Yeah, me too.

198
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:57,250
[horn honking]

199
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:14,458
[RABBIT A] Here comes the
boss! Hey, boss over here!

200
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:17,000
[RABBIT B] Are my ears
on straight? Yes, yes, maybe.

201
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,958
[OOLONG] Whoa! Looks like
the circus has come to town!

202
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:38,250
[RABBIT A and RABBIT B]
Oh, Boss, help us!

203
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:40,750
Knock it off, you mugs!

204
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:42,958
Just point me out the sap that
thinks he's tough enough to take

205
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:44,500
on the mighty Rabbits!

206
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:45,958
[RABBIT A and RABBIT B]
That's him, over there!

207
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:49,125
[BULMA] You mean that
old furball is their leader?

208
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:50,666
[OOLONG] Yeah, look
at him! He looks like a

209
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,541
reject from an Easter parade!

210
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:54,416
[RABBIT A] We heard that, pig!

211
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,083
[OOLONG] Oh yeah?
What are you gonna do?

212
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:58,625
Wiggle your nose and tickle me?!

213
00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:01,500
[RABBIT B] Awfully big
words for a bacon bit!

214
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:05,166
[RABBIT A] Good one!

215
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:07,750
I know I've seen
that rabbit before...

216
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,416
[BOSS RABBIT] You call
yourself "Rabbits" and

217
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,416
you got beaten up by a kid?

218
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,125
[RABBIT A and RABBIT B]
Uh, sorry Boss...

219
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:15,625
[BOSS RABBIT] Quit groveling!

220
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:17,125
Watch this!

221
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:25,625
[howling]

222
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:27,500
[BOSS RABBIT] Let's
shake hands, baby!

223
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:30,458
I wouldn't trust him, Bulma.

224
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:34,000
Hey, did you want
to be friends with us?

225
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:36,041
[BOSS RABBIT] Certainly!

226
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:39,041
Now I remember!
His touch is his weapon!

227
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:41,791
If they shake his hand
they're goners for sure!

228
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:45,541
There! Now make
like a nice bunny and

229
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:47,500
hop out of here, would ya?

230
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:52,000
You touched me!

231
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:00,583
[GOKU] You turned
Bulma into a carrot!

232
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,125
[BOSS RABBIT]
Want a bite, maybe?

233
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:05,625
[RABBIT A] Serves you right
for messin' with da boss!

234
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:10,416
His name is Monster Carrot,
and his touch is lethal!

235
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:12,333
[GOKU] You bully!

236
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:14,125
Change her back!

237
00:16:16,916 --> 00:16:18,166
Sure, kid, if you want to end

238
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:20,916
up like your friend. Why
don't you come and get me?

239
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:23,333
[MONSTER CARROT] But you gotta
like vegetables, 'cause if you

240
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:26,291
touch me, you're gonna be one!

241
00:16:28,291 --> 00:16:30,958
Come on, Goku, use
your Power Pole! That way you

242
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:32,333
won't have to touch him!

243
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:34,083
Yeah, that's right! Ha!

244
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:44,541
[MONSTER CARROT] Stop! Don't
forget about your friend here!

245
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,833
[laughing]

246
00:16:48,916 --> 00:16:51,166
Kid! You take one more
step and I'll have this

247
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:53,291
delicious carrot for my lunch!

248
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:59,000
[laughing]

249
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:01,666
Alright,
you win! I give up!

250
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:03,541
Oolong!

251
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:04,916
What do you think
I should do now?

252
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,375
[OOLONG] Run for it!

253
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:09,833
[RABBIT A] Man,
that pig is flying!

254
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:11,958
Oolong,
you're not a pig!

255
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:13,625
You're a big chicken!

256
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:15,750
Tough break!
You're on your own, kid!

257
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:17,625
It's just you and
the Rabbits now!

258
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:19,083
Boys! Go get 'em!

259
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:21,666
[RABBIT A and RABBIT B]
Sure thing, Boss!

260
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:24,041
Yes!

261
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:26,875
I'm gonna pound him
flat like a postage stamp!

262
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:36,750
[blows landing]

263
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:39,500
Puar! Come on!
That kid needs our help!

264
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:42,958
It's up to us to get him out
of this mess! Otherwise we'll

265
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:44,750
never see those Dragon Balls!

266
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:48,083
[YAMCHA] Change into a
bird and snatch that carrot!

267
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:49,541
[PUAR] Right!

268
00:17:58,291 --> 00:17:59,791
Come on, pick it
up a little, boys.

269
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:01,916
I don't have all day, you know.

270
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,208
[blows landing]

271
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:16,125
[screaming]

272
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:33,625
We've got the carrot, Goku!

273
00:18:33,708 --> 00:18:36,250
Now you can finish him
off with your Power Pole!

274
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:37,708
Hey!

275
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:40,875
You're helping us!
That's real nice of you!

276
00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:43,958
Never mind that!
Get Monster Carrot!

277
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:45,125
Right.

278
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:47,250
[MONSTER CARROT]
Come back here, thief!

279
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:51,958
I! Want! My! Carrot!

280
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:54,458
[MONSTER CARROT] Gotcha! Uh-oh!

281
00:18:54,958 --> 00:18:56,333
[YAMCHA] Yeah, here she comes!

282
00:18:58,125 --> 00:19:00,791
[MONSTER CARROT] Ah, I
want that carrot, you dumb bird!

283
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:02,375
Gimme, gimme, gimme!

284
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:05,958
Good work, Puar, now
bring that carrot over here!

285
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:07,416
And hurry!

286
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:11,583
[MONSTER CARROT] Touch me!

287
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:20,250
[GOKU and YAMCHA] Ow...

288
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:21,708
[screaming]

289
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,458
Hey! If we smash
into him, we'll

290
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:32,208
touch and turn into carrots!

291
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:48,375
Are you looking for
this, Mister Rabbit?

292
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:03,125
[MONSTER CARROT] Stop! What
about your little friend?!

293
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:06,083
That's right. You
don't want anything

294
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:07,541
to happen to her, do ya?

295
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:12,791
[screaming]

296
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:17,958
[MASTER CARROT] Whoa! Who are
you? Where did you come from?

297
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:20,375
[PUAR] Touch me! All
I want is a little touch.

298
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:22,000
Just one, little touch!

299
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:25,041
No! Stay back! Stay back!

300
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:27,416
Goku, time to
use your Power Pole!

301
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:31,500
[GOKU] Power Pole! Extend!

302
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:42,333
[screaming]

303
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:44,791
Hey! You better change her back!

304
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:46,541
Or else I'm gonna
whack you again!

305
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:49,541
Whack me again?

306
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:51,666
Yeah, whack you again.

307
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,916
Okay, I guess you win!

308
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:03,000
Bulma!

309
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:05,541
Oh man, I feel
like a vegetable.

310
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:09,250
You were until Yamcha
and Puar helped us!

311
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:11,041
Yamcha! Where is he?

312
00:21:12,458 --> 00:21:13,958
I guess he
took off already.

313
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:19,458
She likes you.

314
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:23,166
You know, it was a lot
easier for me to be around her

315
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:24,916
when she was just produce!

316
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:35,375
[RABBIT A] Try not
to touch us, boss!

317
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:38,541
So, Oolong!

318
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:39,750
Where were you, huh?

319
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:42,625
Some friend you are,
running away like that!

320
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:45,541
I, uh, made sure
no one took the car!

321
00:21:45,625 --> 00:21:48,166
Yeah right! You might
as well have coward stamped

322
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:50,666
on that big forehead of yours!

323
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,791
Boy, you were a
lot nicer when you

324
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:53,750
were a carrot, ya know.

325
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:54,625
[BULMA] I heard that!

326
00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:56,416
[shouting]

327
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:59,583
That should do it!
Now to finish the job with

328
00:21:59,666 --> 00:22:01,041
my Power Pole!

329
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:05,791
He's gonna whack us!

330
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:07,458
[GOKU] Don't worry,
I'm not going to hit you.

331
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:13,000
Power Pole, extend!

332
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,291
How can we
ever repay you?

333
00:22:26,375 --> 00:22:28,666
Hey, don't sweat it!
This one's on my house!

334
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,208
[BULMA] So, what did you
do with the Rabbit gang?

335
00:22:35,291 --> 00:22:37,750
I took 'em to the moon!

336
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:42,750
[GOKU] I told them that if they
made enough rabbit treats for

337
00:22:42,833 --> 00:22:45,833
all the kids on Earth, I might
let them come back down.

338
00:22:45,916 --> 00:22:47,291
It should keep
them busy for awhile.

339
00:22:47,708 --> 00:22:49,000
[BULMA] Rabbit treats?

340
00:22:49,083 --> 00:22:51,500
[GOKU] What, don't
you like marshmallows?
