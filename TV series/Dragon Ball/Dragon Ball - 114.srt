Last time on Dragon Ball,

00:02:13,916 --> 00:02:17,625
Goku returned to Korin's Tower
following a near-fatal fight

00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:19,083
I don't know what's
goin' on down there.

[gasps]

163
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:28,541
[YAJIROBI] You can't
see anything from here.

164
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:31,541
[KORIN] Because you're not
lookin' in the right place.

165
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:33,458
Huh?

166
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:34,916
Over there.

167
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:42,916
How's a jar gonna help see?

168

[yelps]

169
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:51,916
[YAJIROBI]
That's King Piccolo!

170
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:57,291
[PICCOLO] You work for me, now.
You will do my bidding.

171
00:13:57,375 --> 00:14:03,083
[gasps] I will not help you
betray my people. Never!

172
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:05,000
Betray them?

173
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:07,833
[KING] I was elected
to preserve the peace.

174
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:10,708
So far, it doesn't look like
you're doing too good of a job.

175
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:13,291
[gasps]

176
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:14,666
[laughs]

177
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:18,083
In fact, one could say that
your peace is in pieces!

178
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:22,791
[laughs]

179
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:24,875
[YAJIROBI]
Uh, do you have another jar?

180
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:26,541
I don't like this one.

181
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:30,375
[KORIN] Goku, why did you come
here? What do you want me to do?

182
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:32,583
Don't you know?
You've already guessed

183
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:34,875
everything about King Piccolo.

184
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:36,708
Well, sort of.

185
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:41,125
He's a terrible monster!
Somebody has to defeat him!

186
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:43,791
I want to continue
my training with you.

187
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:45,666
[KORIN]
Hm...

188
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:48,500
Well, there's no sense in
training a body that's injured.

189
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:51,625
First thing's first.
You need energy.

190
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:56,250
Here we go! Catch!

191
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:59,333
Oh, thanks, Master. This
is a Senzu bean isn't it?

192
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:02,166
Hm? Ah! The beans!

193
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:05,083
What?! Senzu beans?!

194
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:07,208
These are the beans
you were talking about?!

195
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:08,625
That's them.

196
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:11,500
[YAJIROBI] You call this
special?! This is my reward?!

197
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:13,833
I can't believe I
went through all that

198
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:15,208
just for these lousy beans!

199
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:17,250
Well, I'm gonna get my fill!

200
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:27,750
Stupid beans!

You're silly, Yajirobe!
You only need one bean.

207
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:54,708
They last for ten whole days.

208
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:04,291
[KORIN] Ha! Those beans sure
do the trick, don't they?

209
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:07,291
Now, you should be feelin'
better pretty soon.

211

I feel fantastic! Yeah!

[GOKU laughing, grunting]

213
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:31,333
[YAMCHA] I still can't
believe Master's gone.

00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:33,541
[BULMA] Neither can I.
Just a short while ago,

Huh? Ah!

221
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:52,708
Is that who I think it is?!

222
00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:54,541
[BULMA]
Master Roshi!

[BULMA]
You're back!

00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:07,083
Huh?

00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:08,750
[BULMA, YAMCHA, PUAR growl]

[TURTLE]
I thought the door would open

00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:19,500
and Master Roshi
would walk through.

Oh...

Right.

238
00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:48,208
I forgot and set a
place for Master Roshi.

239
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:53,833
Man! If only I were stronger!

240
00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:57,291
Stop it! Tien will
defeat King Piccolo!

Now, I wanna make sure
we're absolutely clear here.

250
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:25,708
You want me to train you again?

251
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:28,708
Yes, Master Korin.
Just like the old days.

252

[GOKU]
Really!

253
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,333
Sorry, my boy.

254
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:34,750
But to be completely honest,

255
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:36,875
there's nothing left
for me to teach you.

256
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:40,125
Aw... What do you mean, nothing?

257
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:42,916
[KORIN grumbles] I know how
badly you want something new

258
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,625
to use against Piccolo,
but I'm all tapped out.

259
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:48,458
It's not like I gave ya a crash
course the first time around.

260
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:50,458
You mastered the master.

261
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:55,833
Still, that won't be enough.
Many great warriors

262
00:19:55,916 --> 00:19:57,958
have tried what
you're attempting.

263
00:19:58,041 --> 00:20:00,750
But he manages to kill everyone!

264
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:04,666
That monster even
killed Master Roshi.

265
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:08,416
What!? King Piccolo
killed Master Roshi!?

266
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,166
[KORIN]
Yes.

267
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,375
You-You mean I'll never
get to see him again,

268
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:14,625
just like my grandpa?!

269
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:17,791
Well, in these cases,
that's what normally happens.

270
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:22,250
Oh, no. But I never even
got to say goodbye.

[ROSHI] Well, hello there!
I'm the Turtle Hermit.

00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:34,291
It's called the Flying Nimbus.

Isn't it neato?!

If you boys want to
learn about martial arts,

00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:03,083
you've got to go out
there and find me a date!

[MERMAID]
Hi.

280
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:11,083
So what d'ya say
you and me go inside

281
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:15,000
and learn some more
about our species!

282
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:16,583
There's a lot more
to this training

283
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:18,875
than you boys might realize.

284
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:21,375
And there's so much more
to learn if you're

285
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:24,875
going to be ready for the
World Martial Arts Tournament.

I've got to stop him!

[KORIN] Hold it! You mustn't
face him in anger!

too many lives already!

Cool down and
listen for a minute.

If you seek him now,
he'll kill you.

301
00:22:08,375 --> 00:22:10,875
I don't have a choice!
I'm not scared

302

and I'm not gonna
hide in a tower!

303
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:16,875
Well, if he's not
afraid of death,

I guess he could take a sip.

Ultra Divine Water? Is that like
the Sacred Water I drank before?

308
00:22:27,666 --> 00:22:33,708
That's for amateurs.
This is the real stuff.

[NARRATOR] What is Ultra Divine
Water, and what deadly secret

does it possess?

As Tien Shinhan desperately

313
00:22:44,708 --> 00:22:47,666
he must wrestle with the
same dilemma facing Goku.

willing to face his own demise?
