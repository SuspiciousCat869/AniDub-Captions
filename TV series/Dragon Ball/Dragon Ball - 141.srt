[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball...

2
00:02:13,291 --> 00:02:15,500
The first match of the
semi-finals began

3
00:02:15,583 --> 00:02:18,750
as Goku took on Tien Shinhan.

4
00:02:22,958 --> 00:02:24,291
[GOKU]
Haah!

5
00:02:24,375 --> 00:02:27,708
[TIEN yells]

6
00:02:27,791 --> 00:02:30,958
Look out below!
Goku is falling fast!

7
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:33,958
[TIEN] Have you been wearing
that underneath your clothes

8
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:36,125
throughout the
entire tournament?

9
00:02:36,208 --> 00:02:37,208
It must weigh a ton!

10
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:38,708
[GOKU]
Kami insisted.

11
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:41,166
It's not much different
than Master Roshi's style...

12
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:43,583
He wore a turtle
shell to gain strength.

13
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:45,458
It's pretty much
the same principle here.

14
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:46,750
[NARRATOR]
Once he shed the weights,

15
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,708
Goku felt as light as a feather,

16
00:02:48,791 --> 00:02:52,625
and enjoyed a phenomenal
increase in speed and agility.

17
00:02:52,708 --> 00:02:54,791
Goku entertained the crowd
while he tested

18
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:56,500
his newfound quickness...

19
00:02:56,583 --> 00:03:00,208
Soon, the action continued
with a surprising twist.

20
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:04,166
[GOKU] This belt does
belong to you, right?

21
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:10,083
[NARRATOR]
Goku was so fast,

22
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:13,291
even Tien couldn't
see his movements.

23
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:14,750
[TIEN]
Hey, my belt!

24
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:18,166
[NARRATOR] Even Junior,
Goku's nemesis, was intrigued,

25
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:20,208
but Tien remained determined,

26
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:22,500
declaring that if three eyes
were not sufficient

27
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:25,791
to track Goku, he would use 12!

It's like he's on fire.

Nice move. Finally,

Wait, four against one?
That's not fair.

Wow, incredible!

00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:00,958
[ANNOUNCER] Tien Shinhan
has split into four!

Presumably, by using the

Hello! Launch, wake up!

You've actually split
into four separate people...

did you do it?

"How am I going to

the beating Goku just took,

I'd say four Tien Shinhans

92

are tremendously more
powerful than one!

his hands full.

00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,000
[GOKU]
Ow!

168
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:59,208
[CROWD cheering]

169
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:00,666
[TIENS gasping]

170
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:04,708
[laughs]

171
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:06,916
This... can't be!

172
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,875
Tien Shinhan is left stunned
as Goku rebounds from his fall

173
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:13,000
as though nothing had happened!

174
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:14,250
[GOKU giggles]

175
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:16,708
That was a good one, Tien.
I'm a little sore.

176
00:14:16,791 --> 00:14:19,083
A... A little?!

177
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:22,500
Remarkable... I get the feeling
we could drop an entire city

178
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:25,708
on top of him and all
he'd get is a headache!

179
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:29,250
Careful. Next time
you might not walk away.

180
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:32,375
Heh! There won't
be a next time...

181
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:35,083
You won't use
the same trick again.

182
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:36,583
You sure?

183
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:43,125
[ROSHI thinking] Yet again,
Goku does the impossible...

184
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:46,250
Ya know, he's about as
honest as you can get,

185
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:50,916
but when it comes to the laws
of physics, he's a wanted man!

186
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,958
[ROSHI thinking] As I've
watched him grow over the years,

187
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:57,583
it seems what makes
him so special

188
00:14:57,666 --> 00:14:59,041
isn't his strength or speed.

189
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:02,833
It's his endurance.
No one can break him!

190
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:06,708
I respect you, Goku.
But I will win at any cost.

191
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:08,166
Okay.

192
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:12,375
[TIEN] "Okay"? What does that
mean? I'm trying to tell you

193
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:13,791
you're in danger.

194
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:16,416
If you stay in this fight,
I will hurt you, or worse!

195
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,916
Hah! I've already found two weak
spots in your strategy, Tien.

196
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,416
I'll be fine.

197
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,875
[TIEN growls]

198
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:26,791
You see his weakness,
Goku, and I see yours.

199
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,958
My technique was perfect.

200
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:35,916
You don't know what
you're talking about!

201
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,916
If you're uncertain,
why don't you just try it again.

202
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:39,958
You'll see.

203
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:42,500
Oh, I'll do it again, all right.

204
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:44,625
And this time
I'll use my full power!

205
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:47,291
I tried to be polite
and give you a way out,

206
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:48,791
but you wouldn't take it.

207
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:51,500
Now the consequences
are on your head!

208
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:54,541
[giggles]

209
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:57,833
What weak spots do you
think Goku's talking about?

210
00:15:57,916 --> 00:16:00,500
[YAMCHA] Maybe he hit his head
harder than we thought.

211
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:03,083
[GOKU]
What are you guys waiting for?

212
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:05,791
I'm ready when you are.
Let's get this over with!

213
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:07,250
Fine!

214
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:22,875
It's not clear why, but it
appears the four Tien Shinhans

215
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:25,625
are preparing to repeat
their last performance!

216
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:27,791
Will Goku have
better luck this time,

217
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:31,458
or will this move put Tien
back in the winner's circle?

218
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:45,541
[TIEN]
Now!

219
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,125
[TIEN]
There he is!

220
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:11,375
It's no use, Goku.
You can't escape!

221
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:15,708
Fire!

222
00:17:25,958 --> 00:17:28,000
Sorry to disappoint you, Tien.

223
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:30,250
But my future looks
bright from up here!

224
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:39,375
Solar Flare!

225
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:46,666
[TIEN screams]

226
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:47,875
My eyes!

227
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:49,583
[screaming]

228
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:52,458
Goku has created a
light so intense,

229
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:56,625
it's as if he threw the sun
itself in Tien Shinhan's face!

230
00:17:57,833 --> 00:17:59,375
[TIEN screams]

231
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:01,833
[ANNOUNCER] Ironically,
this is the same technique

232
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:04,500
Tien Shinhan used in
the previous tournament.

233
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:08,375
Only this time,
it's being used against him!

234
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:09,791
Goku's plan is working,

235
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:12,916
as the dazzling lights
take their toll on Tien,

236
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,208
and anyone else not fortunate
enough to be wearing sunglasses.

237
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:21,750
This is weak spot number one...

238
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:23,500
Your eyesight's a
little too good.

239
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:25,458
[TIEN]
I thought I was the only master

240
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:28,041
of the Solar Flare Technique.

241
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:30,583
[TIEN growls, yells]

244
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:46,166
Wrong way. I'm over here!

[TIEN growls]

246
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,666
[TIEN] I see you!
This was a bad idea, Goku.

247
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,791
You have to rely on
your sight, same as me,

248
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:55,791
which means you're also
at a disadvantage.

249
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:59,625
I have to disagree... There are
two of you behind me, right?

250
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:01,375
One is planning a
knife-hand attack,

251
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:03,458
and the other, a right
round house kick.

252
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:06,125
You guessed!
How can you be sure?

253
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:09,708
[GOKU] Training. I won't
bore you with the details.

254
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:11,000
[ROSHI thinking] I wasn't
aware of some

255
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:13,083
eyes-in-the-back-of-your-head
technique!

256
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:15,708
I'd better take
some night classes.

257
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:18,750
I think that's enough...

258
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:19,875
Lesson finished.

259
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:22,416
I assume you can see
clearly again?

260
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:28,625
Good. Then there is no need for
me to hold back any longer.

261
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:32,875
Holding back?
How did you manage that?

262
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:34,166
All this time...

263
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:37,916
...you've been
so busy... losing.

264
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Your second weak spot
hurt you the most.

265
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:42,708
It's what cost you this match.

266
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:45,750
Do tell!

267
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:49,708
You made the first one worse
by breaking up into four!

268
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:52,875
No!

269

00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:50,333
I win. Don't get up
on my account.

280
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:56,083
That's an impressive technique.
I wish I'd known of it earlier.

281
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:59,166
There've been a lot of enemies
I would've loved to use it on.

282
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:01,208
But I don't think it
works in a fight like this.

283
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:03,333
Not only were you
split into fourths,

284
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:05,000
but so were your strengths.

285
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:08,458
[ROSHI thinking]
Good reasoning.

286
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:11,208
Nice to see Goku has
worked on sharpening more

287
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:13,416
than just his fighting skills.

288
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:18,916
I won't pretend
I'm not wounded...

289
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,625
But it's only my pride...

290
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:25,000
You did a good job, Goku.
Congratulations.

291
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:26,958
That's it? Congratulations?!

292
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:29,541
Thanks for piling me up
like a stack of pancakes?!

293
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:33,125
Come on, Tien! Don't you want to
know how he did it?! I sure do!

294
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:34,416
Yeah, me, too!

295
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,625
Nice speech, but how
did he figure it all out?

296
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:38,625
It's unbelievable!

297
00:21:38,708 --> 00:21:42,583
I guess that's why he's
the big hero and I'm... not.

298
00:21:42,666 --> 00:21:46,166
[CHICHI] There are no small
heroes, only sidekicks.

Ah, oh! Okay, it's official!

302
00:21:55,541 --> 00:22:00,166
Tien Shinhan is out of bounds,
ending an unprecedented battle!

303
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:02,791
Goku wins the first
match of the semi-finals

304
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:05,791
and now goes on to the
championship round

305
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:09,083
where the 23rd Master of
Martial Arts will be determined!

306

Ah, well done, Goku.

307
00:22:12,291 --> 00:22:18,083
You won! You won!
I'm so proud of you!

Enjoy the adulation of
the crowd while it lasts...

310
00:22:32,166 --> 00:22:35,708
When I crush you, those
cheers will turn to sorrow.

311
00:22:38,291 --> 00:22:39,875
[NARRATOR]
On the road to victory,

312
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:43,208
Goku has faced many
impossible challenges.

313
00:22:43,291 --> 00:22:46,500
However, none have
been as treacherous

314
00:22:46,583 --> 00:22:48,833
and diabolical as Junior.

315
00:22:48,916 --> 00:22:53,625
Their confrontation begins
next time on Dragon Ball!
