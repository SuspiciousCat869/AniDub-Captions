[NARRATOR]
Previously on Dragon Ball...

00:02:15,458 --> 00:02:18,333
After surviving his encounters
with the Red Ribbon Army,

3
00:02:18,416 --> 00:02:21,208
Goku braved the
urban wilds of West City

4
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:23,666
in search of
Bulma's technical expertise.

5
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:27,000
Now, with the Dragon Radar
once again in working order,

6
00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:30,041
Bulma has decided to
accompany Goku on his quest,

7
00:02:30,125 --> 00:02:32,208
and the two
sail the wide blue skies

8
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:34,875
towards their
next great adventure!

the boy riding the cloud?

10
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:45,416
[BOY'S FATHER] No! But I see one
that looks like an alligator!

[yawns]

12
00:03:04,458 --> 00:03:06,958
We made it to the ocean, Bulma.

13
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:09,666
Huh?

14
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:12,666
Okay. Just keep going straight.

15
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:16,541
[yawns] How much longer?

16
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:20,458
Well, at the rate we're going
I'd say... forever!

17
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:22,500
That long, huh?

18
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:26,333
Yeah. It's too bad the
Flying Nimbus can't go faster.

19
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:31,125
Huh? Hey! Nimbus! Faster!

20

G-G-G-G-G-G-okuuuuu!

22
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:42,333

Yeah, Nimbus! Faster!

Isn't this dangerous?!

Nah! We'll be fine. Watch this!

Goku and Bulma are
heading for their third!

30

But as they'll soon find out,

is leading them straight into

[STAFF OFFICER]
I seriously doubt it!

37
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:44,666
That island base is top secret!

38
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:47,958
He is most likely
just following his radar.

39
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:52,291
Aye! Look how fast he's going!

40

Yes sir!

Good! Blue will be
ready for 'im!

everything for you?

But, sir!
Our Dragon Radar stinks!

It's true! It only
gives us the general idea

It's just too vague, sir!

That's why you can't find it!

00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,000
[BULMA] Ugh! My own father!

165
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:33,458
[GOKU] I think this is the
place! It seems about right!

166
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:49,958
[BULMA sighs]

167
00:11:55,583 --> 00:12:00,000
What am I supposed
to do while he's gone?

168
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:02,416
This is boring!

169
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,875
Hey, wait!

170
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:05,791
[BULMA laughs]

171
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:08,250
If there was a boat,
there must be people!

172
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:11,458
And where there's people,
there's shopping!

173
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:48,000
[groans]

174
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:10,583
[breathes heavily]

175
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:14,291
[GOKU]
Hey! Bulma! It's too deep!

176
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:16,500
I can't hold
my breath that long!

177
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:22,625
Hey, Bulma.
The water's too... deep?

178
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:25,458
[GOKU] Where'd she go?
She was just here!

179
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,416
If there's a resort here,
they might even have a store

180
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,458
that sells the DynoCaps I need.

181
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:38,708
Goku's strong, but I don't think
he realizes how deep it is.

182
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:43,083
Wow! What pretty flowers!

183
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:44,541
Huh?

184
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:52,208
[screams, whimpers]

185
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:56,166

[whimpers]

187
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:03,458
[sighs] Thank goodness!

188
00:14:03,916 --> 00:14:07,833
Uhhh... I'm starting to think
this island is deserted!

189
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:09,625
[BULMA] Those scuba divers
must have come from

190
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:13,500
a yacht or something.
It feels so empty.

191
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:17,125
[birds cawing]

192
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:19,666
Huh? No, wait!

193
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,541
[BULMA] There's someone here!

194
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,208
Hey! Hello!

195
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:29,375
Hi!

196
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:32,625
Huh?

197
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,291
What?

198
00:14:37,416 --> 00:14:38,666
This can't be happening!

199
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:41,708
There must be
some mistake! Aaah!

200
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:46,958
[BULMA]
Help me! Somebody, please!

201
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:51,625
Why me? This isn't fair!

202
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:57,958
[BULMA] Help me!

203
00:14:58,041 --> 00:15:00,416
I'm too young to die!

204
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:03,166
[PILOT 2] Stop right there!

205
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:04,541
[BULMA] Oh, no!

206
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:06,666
[PILOT 1] That's far enough!

207
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:11,500
Hey! It's a doe!
No little buck around here.

208
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:13,916
Yeah! Roger that!

209
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,500
[yells]

210
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:18,250
[PILOT 2]
Don't move! Or we'll shoot!

211
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:23,000
It's... It's over!

212
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:45,875
[BULMA whimpers]

213
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:52,375
Well, what do we have here?

214
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:55,750
Just a frightened girl!
Sorry about that!

215
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:58,250
[PILOT 1] We thought
you were someone else!

216
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:01,125
What? This was all a mistake?!

217
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:04,166
Jerks! Are you crazy?
What's the big idea?!

218
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,250
I could have been killed!

219
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:08,083
Hey! Relax, babe!

220
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:09,458
You shot at me!

221
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:11,750
Come on!
Cut us a little slack, girl!

222
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:13,250
We were following orders!

223
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:16,333
That's right! We're
soldiers! Military studs!

224
00:16:16,416 --> 00:16:18,333
[BULMA] I see.

225
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:20,583
Well, hey! My name's Bulma!

226
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:22,625
I'm looking for a place to shop!

227
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:25,875
Maybe find myself
a submarine on discount!

228
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:27,291
A submarine?

229
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:31,625
I like to sight see! You know.
Look at all the reefs.

230
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:34,541
You can't even
buy capsules here, babe!

231
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:36,666
This island's deserted!

232
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:40,166
No way! Well, darn!

233
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:43,916
How strange!
I wonder whose boat that was?

234
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,791
[BOTH] Hm! [chuckle]

235
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:53,458
Hello! Bulma! Where are you?

236
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:56,458
Uhh! Man!
She can never stay put!

237
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:59,708
[GOKU yells]

238
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:08,416
Uh. Huh?

239
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:11,625
Yum!

240
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:15,125
Thanks! See ya, then.

241
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:17,708
Hold on!
You're under arrest...

242
00:17:17,791 --> 00:17:19,458
for being too pretty!

243
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:21,708
No joke! What a crime!

244
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:24,458
Gosh! You men
think I'm pretty, huh?

245
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:28,291
Uh, huh!
Yeah! Very pretty!

246
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:32,500
Wow! You soldiers
made my day! Thank you!

247
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:34,333
We did, aye?

248
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:35,958
Hhhnnnh!

249
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:37,208
Mmm!

250
00:17:37,291 --> 00:17:40,041
Hey! Chicky baby!
Let's have some fun, 'kay?

251
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,000
Fun? With you?

[BOTH chuckle]

253
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:46,291
Hey! Easy does it there, boys.

254
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:48,583
What do you mean by "fun"?

255
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:51,166
Fun!

256
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:54,416
The good kind of fun,
or the bad kind?

257
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,000
Good!

258
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:59,625
Like swimming?
And hiking? That kind?

259
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:01,166
[BOTH] No!

Oh! I see... That fun!

Too bad, guys!
I'm only sixteen!

00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,166
Sorry! No fun!

264
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:13,541
[BULMA] I'm under age!

265
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:14,916
[PILOT 2] Yeah, heh-heh.

266

Can you guys wait?

00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:28,333
[chuckles]

330
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:33,083
[GOKU] So, I uh, I guess you
didn't find any Dyno-caps, huh?

331
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:36,166
No, Goku,
I didn't find any Dyno-caps...

332
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:38,208
Great observation.

333
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:42,208
Bulma! Guess what?
I just had an idea!

334
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:44,541
We can go to Master Roshi's!

335
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:47,291
He lives around here.
Doesn't he?

336
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:48,458
Ugh!

337
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:50,500
[GOKU]
He has all kinds of neat stuff!

338
00:21:50,583 --> 00:21:54,250
I'll bet he even has
one of those subma-thingies!

339
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:56,916
Ick! That old coot!

340
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:03,541
[ROSHI sneezing]

341
00:22:03,625 --> 00:22:07,666
Oh boy, oh boy!
Eeeh! Goodness!

342
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:10,750
There must be
a pretty girl nearby!

343
00:22:10,833 --> 00:22:14,583
[ROSHI] That's the only time
I sneeze like that! Heh-heh!

344
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,458
I'm not going there!

345
00:22:16,541 --> 00:22:19,625
What? Sure you are!
You have to, right?

346
00:22:19,708 --> 00:22:23,833
Hey! I'm sure he'll be
really happy to see us!

347
00:22:23,916 --> 00:22:27,250
[GOKU] Come on, Bulma!
I'll let you ride in my shirt!

348
00:22:27,333 --> 00:22:29,291
[chuckles]

349
00:22:29,375 --> 00:22:32,833
[BULMA] No, Goku!
I'm not going! I refuse!

350
00:22:32,916 --> 00:22:35,083
[GOKU] But what about
the Dragon Balls?

351
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:40,375
[BULMA] I said no--I mean, yay!

352
00:22:40,458 --> 00:22:42,458
[NARRATOR]
As Goku speeds off with Bulma

353
00:22:42,541 --> 00:22:46,125
toward Master Roshi's,
the dastardly General Blue

354
00:22:46,208 --> 00:22:49,625
awaits his return
with eager anticipation!

355
00:22:49,708 --> 00:22:52,458
Join us next time
on Dragon Ball!
