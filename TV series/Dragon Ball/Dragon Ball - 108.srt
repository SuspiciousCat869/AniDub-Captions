00:02:11,541 --> 00:02:13,208
[NARRATOR]
Previously on Dragon Ball,

2
00:02:13,291 --> 00:02:15,000
after decades
of being imprisoned

3
00:02:15,083 --> 00:02:17,291
by the Turtle Hermit's
Master, Mutaito,

4
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:19,500
the evil King Piccolo escaped

5
00:02:19,583 --> 00:02:22,083
and began a new plot
to conquer the world

6
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:23,916
using the Dragon Balls.

7
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,125
Fortunately,
the mountain boy, Yajirobe

8
00:02:26,208 --> 00:02:28,666
was able to cut through
the King's minions,

9
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:31,333
preventing the extraterrestrial
from getting his clutches

10
00:02:31,416 --> 00:02:32,875
on the magical orbs.

11
00:02:32,958 --> 00:02:34,666
Out of fear of being recaptured,

12
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,291
Piccolo sent his chief
enforcer, Tambourine,

13
00:02:37,375 --> 00:02:40,625
to destroy all members of
the Martial Arts Society.

14
00:02:40,708 --> 00:02:45,125
His first victim was Krillin,
whom Goku vowed to avenge.

15
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:47,458
I told you I'd make you pay!

16
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:49,083
I'll never forgive you
for killing Krillin

17
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:51,375
and my Nimbus Cloud!

18
00:02:51,458 --> 00:02:55,791
And I want my Dragon Ball back!

19
00:02:55,875 --> 00:03:02,583
This is truly hilarious!
You want to fight me again?

20
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:07,875
Last time I was hungry, but now
I'm full and ready to beat you!

21
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:11,125
[PICCOLO] Beat me? You're not
even in the same league.

22
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:16,250
I'll stop you, one way
or another! You'll see!

23
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:19,333
[NARRATOR]
With that, the showdown began.

24
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:29,375
This one's for Krillin!

25
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:35,750
This one's for Krillin!

26

[radar beeping]

27
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:52,041
[ROSHI]
I hear you saved my turtle.

28
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:53,333
[GOKU]
Who are you?

29
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:57,125
[ROSHI] I'm Master Roshi,
the Turtle Hermit.

30
00:03:57,208 --> 00:03:59,500
A long time ago,
Gohan told me

31
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:02,208
he was raising a
small boy who had a tail.

32
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:05,000
[GOKU] That's me!
Gohan was my grandpa!

33
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:11,291
[ROSHI] Who is this?

34
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:13,166
[KRILLIN]
Hi, my name is Krillin.

35
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:14,583
It's an honor to meet you.

36
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:16,541
I've traveled all the way
from a small village

37
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:18,375
in the east.
I want to be your pupil

38
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,958
and learn the secrets
of Martial Arts!

39
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:22,250
[GOKU, KRILLIN laughing]

40
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:24,166
[GOKU]
This is going to be fun!

41
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:26,083
[CHIAOTZU] Hey look!

42
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:27,125
Eh?

43
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:28,416
[CHIAOTZU] It's flashing!

44
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:33,958
With any luck that's the
monster who destroyed Krillin.

45
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:39,250
If it is, I have a feeling
that's where we'll find Goku.

46
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:41,750
Mm-hmm. If he's alive.

47
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:10,541
[TAMBOURINE
chuckling menacingly]

48
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:17,333
Come on. You talk big.
Let's see if you can back it up.

49
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:22,750
I'm waiting.

50
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:34,583
Stop that!

51
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:37,541
Huh?!

52
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,875

[GOKU growling]

55
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:48,666
I sure hope I never end up
on that kid's revenge list.

56
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:58,916
[radar beeping]

57
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,416
Hey! It's moving again!

58
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:04,250
Do you think that King
Piccolo is onto us yet?

59
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:07,291
Well, whoever it is,
their movement is erratic.

60
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:12,333
Let's go after them.

61
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:20,375
I gotta admit, Goku,
ya did a first-rate job.

62
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:22,875
That monster
deserved what he got.

63
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:27,541
You remember your promise.
He's mine now.

64
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:28,875
[GOKU] Sure.

65
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,333
All right! I'm starving!

66
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:36,875
[TAMBOURINE groaning]

67
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:38,500
Why is he moving?

68
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:43,125
You little rat!

69
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:45,166
Oops, looks like
I stopped too soon.

70
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:50,583
Unbelievable!
How could we, the warrior tribe,

71
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:52,291
be beaten by you?!

72
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:56,791
Pathetic human.

73
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:02,375

74
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:27,208

superior to the human race!

You're not very smart, are you?

That blast was pretty
weak, if you ask me.

Now it's your turn to feel the
same pain that you gave Krillin!

Your majesty, what's wrong?!

What's going on out there?!
This shouldn't be happening!

No! Tambourine!

97
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:37,750
What kind of
creature is out there

98
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:39,791
that could defeat these people?

99
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:41,750
I'm not sure
I want to know, sir.

100
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:43,666
[PICCOLO] Listen!

101
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:44,791
[PILAF] Yes?

[PICCOLO]
Take this vessel to wherever

103

Cymbal and Tambourine
were killed.

104
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:53,041
I'll destroy this
new adversary myself.

105
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:04,333
Thanks a lot! You've completely
annihilated my dinner!

106
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:06,750
What am I supposed
to eat now, huh?

107
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:10,833
Sorry. I was so upset
I forgot all about it.

108
00:11:12,416 --> 00:11:14,500
I had everything ready!

109

Aww, you already started a fire.

110
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:24,666
Yeah. I've tried 'em raw, but
they just don't taste as good.

00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,250
Well, be patient.

112
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:28,458
I'm sure if you keep
that Dragon Ball,

113
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:31,208
another one will
be by soon enough.

[PICCOLO grunting frustratedly]

115
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,083
Two of my finest
warriors were destroyed

116
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:24,333
as if they were mere amateurs!

117
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:28,500
I don't know who is
responsible for this outrage,

118
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:30,958
but I will personally
see to their destruction

119
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:34,291
for interfering with my plans!

120
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:35,583
Oh, wait!

121
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:37,041
What is it?!

122
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:38,958
The Dragon Ball
we've been chasing

123
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:41,541
has been moving in odd patterns.

124
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:43,250
I wonder...

125
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:58,708
It's just as I feared!
According to the map,

126
00:12:58,791 --> 00:13:01,000
there are three Dragon Balls
clustered together

127
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:03,208
and moving towards a fourth!

128
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:04,666
Well, well, well...

129
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,791
Does that mean someone else
is after the Dragon Balls?

130
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:08,833
Do we have some competition?

131
00:13:08,916 --> 00:13:11,458
It looks that way! What now?!

132
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,416
Wait, they've stopped!

133
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,750
It's near here, Master.
We're close.

134
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:44,000
I hope this new ball
also leads to Goku.

135
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:27,791
[TIEN]
It's right over there.

136
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,458
I don't like the looks of this.

Chiaotzu, you stay and
guard the plane, all right?

142
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:24,958
Okay.

143
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:29,000
[ROSHI]
Let's be careful.

144
00:15:57,916 --> 00:16:00,500
[startled gasp]

145
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:01,750
Master Roshi!

146
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:07,625
I'm okay. Keep going. I'm fine.

147
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:16,208
[ROSHI] I wonder if anyone would
ever find this place habitable?

148
00:16:17,916 --> 00:16:20,416
It's secluded enough for a base.

149
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,083
[ROSHI yells]

150
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:23,833
Master, are you all right?!

151
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:28,833
Master!

152
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:31,041
What?

153
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:41,500
[ROSHI]
One, two, three, four, five.

154
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:43,250
Hey, it's the six-star ball.

155
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:45,000
We did it!

156
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:46,833
All we need are three more.

157
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:51,083
This was way too easy.
Who would've hid it here?

158
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:57,000
Well, it wasn't a human,
that's for sure.

159
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:01,833
[ROSHI]
Those crows, see? Feathers.

160
00:17:01,916 --> 00:17:03,250
[TIEN] Crows?

161
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:05,166
[ROSHI] Maybe they picked
it up from somewhere else

162
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,541
and brought it here.

163
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:08,166
[TIEN] That could explain
why the movement

164
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:10,500
was so strange
on the radar.

165
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:13,583
[ROSHI] True, and crows
are attracted to shiny objects

166
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:16,000
like our six-star friend here.

167
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:18,166
[TIEN] I see.

168
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:21,791
I feel like we're being watched.
Let's get out of here.

169
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:23,333
Mm-hmm.

170
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:29,625
Huh? Ah!

171
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:46,375
I never should have
waxed my head! Shoo!

172
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:52,500
Let's make a run for it!

173
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:55,125
[ROSHI]
Best idea I've heard all day!

174
00:17:57,125 --> 00:18:00,250
[ROSHI] That's my head,
not a bird feeder! Scram!

175
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:01,958
Here, this might help!

176
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:07,250
Master! Hurry!

177
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:08,416
Come on!

178
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:16,500
We've been lucky so far.

179
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:18,375
We've managed to collect
four Dragon Balls

180
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:20,083
without too much trouble.

181
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:24,833
[ROSHI] Speak for yourself. I
hope this doesn't leave a scar.

182
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,958
King Piccolo doesn't appear
to be in much of a rush

183
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:29,666
to expand his collection.

184
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,458
I wonder what he's up to.

185
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:34,083
Maybe he doesn't need them.

186
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:38,625
He's probably preoccupied with
exterminating martial artists.

187
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:40,458
[CHIAOTZU]
The radar's flashing!

188
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:45,125
One, two, three, four, five.

189
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:47,333
I count five dots!

190
00:18:47,416 --> 00:18:49,125
Tien, turn around!

191
00:18:55,916 --> 00:18:58,291
With only three
Dragon Balls left to find,

192
00:18:58,375 --> 00:18:59,916
you know it's possible
this is the one

193
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,666
Piccolo's henchman stole
before he killed Krillin.

194
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,291
If you're right,
that means we're

195
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:07,750
about to have to
fight him first-hand.

196
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:09,416
It's going to happen
sooner or later.

197
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,625
I just hope we're ready.

198
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:14,458
I'm sure we're going to win.

199
00:19:14,541 --> 00:19:16,041
I'm afraid the odds
of us winning

200
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:18,125
a head-on battle
aren't too good.

201
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:20,458
Our best bet is to sneak in
through the back door,

202
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:21,625
surprise him,

203
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:23,958
and take the ball
while he's not looking.

204
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:28,875
Then the Eternal Dragon
can defeat him.

205
00:19:28,958 --> 00:19:31,166
That's too passive
for my taste, Master.

206
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:35,208
I say we fight him
hand-to-hand and destroy him!

207
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:37,125
I understand how you feel, Tien.

208
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:39,916
But he's much stronger
than you may think.

209
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,166
With our combined strength,

210
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:44,333
Piccolo still has us
at a disadvantage.

211
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:45,916
Our best bet is to concentrate

212
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,166
on bringing all the
Dragon Balls together.

213
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:52,250
Then we'll let the Eternal
Dragon exterminate King Piccolo.

214
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:54,125
But Master,
I thought our purpose

215
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:55,541
in gathering the Dragon Balls

216
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:57,708
was so we could
resuscitate Krillin.

217
00:19:57,791 --> 00:20:01,750
The Eternal Dragon will only
make one wish come true.

218
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:03,916
And once the Dragon
grants that wish,

219
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,041
the balls are
scattered again, correct?

220
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:11,333
After one year, we can gather
the orbs back together again.

221
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:15,541
At that time, we will
revive Krillin. I hope.

222
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:20,000
What about the Containment Wave?

223
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:22,708
That's a ridiculous
idea, Tien Shinhan!

224
00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:24,916
Forgive me, Master,
but it worked before.

225
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,166
That's what Master Mutaito used
to capture Piccolo, wasn't it?

226
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:30,166
In exchange for his life.

227
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:33,083
Besides, there's no
guarantee that it would work.

228
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:35,500
If we failed,
Yamcha would be the only one

229
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:37,541
left behind
to carry on the fight,

230
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:40,708
and he's in no condition
to defeat Piccolo.

231
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:42,041
I understand.

232
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:47,458
For Master to have such a
reaction to my suggestion,

233
00:20:47,541 --> 00:20:49,666
there must be more to the
Evil Containment Wave

234
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,166
than I realized.

235
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:57,750
I can't believe
this is happening!

236
00:20:57,833 --> 00:21:01,166
They're on the move again and
now they have four Dragon Balls.

237
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:02,500
What are we going to do?!

238
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:05,625
Calm down! They can gather
all the balls they want.

239
00:21:05,708 --> 00:21:08,375
They can't use the
power without all seven.

240
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:11,291
Let's not interrupt their work.

241
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:14,416
Let them hunt down the remaining
six. Saves us the trouble.

242
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,666
Then when they've
gathered them all,

243
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:18,166
we'll take them
in one fell swoop.

244
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:21,291
Hmm. Good idea.

245
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:23,250
We will turn our
immediate attention

246
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:25,000
on finding those responsible

247
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:27,500
for the deaths of
Cymbal and Tambourine.

248
00:21:37,375 --> 00:21:38,541
I'm starving.

249
00:21:39,916 --> 00:21:42,083
The sky is clear
as far as I can see.

250
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:43,875
No sign of any monsters.

251
00:21:45,875 --> 00:21:49,166
You said someone would
be coming if I kept this.

252
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:51,208
I'll go take
another look around.

253
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:57,208
Call me when you
catch someone, okay?

254
00:21:57,291 --> 00:21:59,541
I'll give you the ball then.

255
00:21:59,625 --> 00:22:00,583
--Huh?!
--[radar beeping]

256
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:05,416
Goku, did you hear
what I just said?

257
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,708
It's right on us!

258
00:22:06,791 --> 00:22:09,166
The Dragon Ball is
right around here somewhere!

259
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:11,041
[radar beeping increases]

260
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:12,833
It's here!

261
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:15,250
You mean another Dragon Ball?

262
00:22:16,625 --> 00:22:17,583
Above!

263
00:22:24,875 --> 00:22:27,958
What's that?! It's not
like any bird I've seen.

264
00:22:38,833 --> 00:22:41,916
[NARRATOR] The Turtle Hermit's
greatest fear has been realized.

265
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,666
King Piccolo
has found Goku first!

266
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:47,125
Can Goku survive
against such an

267
00:22:47,208 --> 00:22:49,500
overwhelmingly
powerful adversary?
