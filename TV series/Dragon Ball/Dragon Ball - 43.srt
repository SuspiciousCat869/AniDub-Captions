00:02:11,708 --> 00:02:12,833
Just like you, Doctor...

[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball...

3
00:02:15,083 --> 00:02:17,541
Murasaki threatened
Dr. Flappe into helping him

4
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:19,625
steal Goku's Dragon Balls.

5
00:02:19,708 --> 00:02:22,375
But little Suno's
big lungs brought Number 8

6
00:02:22,458 --> 00:02:26,000
crashing in to scare
the purple thief away.

7
00:02:26,083 --> 00:02:28,875
[GOKU] Ha...!

8
00:02:28,958 --> 00:02:31,916
[NARRATOR] Murasaki tried to
flee across the frozen hillside,

9
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
until Goku's Kamehameha Wave

10
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:37,791
placed him directly in the
path of an icy avalanche.

[MURASAKI screams]

12
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:42,833
[NARRATOR] Later, Dr. Flappe
was able to disarm the bomb

13
00:02:42,916 --> 00:02:45,875
inside Android Number 8,
much to everyone's relief.

14
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:48,333
But when it came to
fixing the Dragon Radar,

15
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:49,916
the doctor had little luck,

16
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,791
and Goku will have
to look elsewhere.

[VOICES chattering, laughing]

18
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:12,875

I'm so glad.

I am too.

Can't you stay?

25
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:25,083
Do you have to go
find your Dragon Ball?

26
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:30,333
That Dragon Ball is all I have
left to remember my Grandpa by.

27
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:35,625
Sleep here tonight, it's much
too late to begin a trip.

28

Okay!

to your friend Goku tomorrow,

why don't you go ahead and
stay here with him tonight?

So, then, I'll
see you later then?

Yes!

What will you do without
your Dragon radar?

41
00:04:28,625 --> 00:04:30,541
How will you find the ball?

42
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:34,041
I'll just go to Bulma's
house and get it fixed.

43

Who's that?

She's the one who
gave this to me.

46
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:40,791
She made it.

47

I see.

48
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:45,958
Where is this "Bulma?"

49
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:47,791
Maybe you know the way...

50
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:50,500
She lives in some place
called "West City."

51

[SUNO] Hmm...

you get there?

I guess there's no
other way, though.

There's not a single plane

Too bad!

you a huge lunch.

can make it there!

a Nimbus cloud?

83
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:28,291
Yeah... I did.

How do you know about
the Flying Nimbus?

Well, you see...

86
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:33,666
When I was a young boy,

87
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,833
there were several of those
things around these parts...

88

w-weren't there?

89

Oh, why, yes indeed!

90
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:42,916
Yes, now, there used to be many
Nimbuses floating around here.

91
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,791
But since only those pure of
heart can ride them,

92
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:47,166
and they're getting pretty rare,

93
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,375
the clouds have nearly
disappeared now.

you must be a very good person.

00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:45,250
Huh?

I got a little question for ya!

336
00:18:50,666 --> 00:18:53,041
[GOKU] What is it?

337
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:54,833
Step into my office.

338
00:18:56,541 --> 00:18:58,708
[GOKU chuckles]

Hey, sir?

346
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:14,291
Do you know where Bulma lives?

347
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:16,500
This idn't no time
for questions!

348
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:18,791
Give me that cash!

349
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:21,166

[GOKU giggles]

352
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:25,916
Now are you gonna tell me

353
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,083
Argh!

00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:36,000
Uhhh...

357
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:39,333
That's it!

00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:48,416
Yeah, okay!

361
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,666
B-B-Bulma's house...

362
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,833
Yeah, uh, you should try
t-to find a police man.

363
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:54,000
Yeah, uh, an of-officer should

[THUG laughs]

365
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:56,875
Okay, I'll find
this guy "Police".

366
00:19:56,958 --> 00:19:57,708
Thank you!

367

[THUG whimpers]

369
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:01,541
No problem...
Don't mention it...

370
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:13,083
Um, like, you're
looking for a policeman?

371
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:15,458
Um, I think there's
one right over there.

372
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:22,375
Ah! I see him! Thanks!

373
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:24,333
Here's some money.

374
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:27,125
Hey! Mr. Police!

375
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:29,500
Uhh...

376
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:31,416
You say "Bulma's"
her name, huh?

377
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,000
You don't happen to have
her home address, or...

378
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:35,500
a description perhaps?

379
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:38,083
Humm... Ah-ha!

380
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:41,916
Okay... blue hair... and-and
big eyes... talks a lot...

381
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,083
Put this over here...
okay, in the back...

382
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:46,250
--[POLICEMAN] Uh-huh...
--[GOKU giggles]

383
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:48,208
Ha-ha! This is her!

384
00:20:48,291 --> 00:20:49,750
[GOKU laughs]

385
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:52,291
[POLICEMAN] Well, uh, that's
not quite enough to go on there.

386
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:54,416
Why not?

387
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,916
Well, "Bulma", that...

388
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,375
that's an interesting
name there...

389
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:00,250
There aren't too many
Bulmas out there.

390
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:02,791
Maybe I can find her in here.

391
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:08,000
I'm not really supposed to
doing this, but here goes, eh?

392
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:09,458
Okay, "Bulma"...

393
00:21:09,541 --> 00:21:10,625
There's three of them.

394
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:12,875
Which one is your friend there?

395
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:15,083
Is it, uh, this one?

396
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:17,375
[GOKU laughs] That's not her!

397
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:20,125
[POLICEMAN] Okay, uh,
what about her?

398
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:23,375
[GOKU] Ah! That's her!
That's Bulma!

399
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:24,958
Ho-ho, golly!

400
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:28,000
That there's the daughter of the
Capsule Corporation's president!

401
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:29,916
Come on! Tell me!

402
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,500
Where does she live?

403
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:34,541
[POLICEMAN] It's kinda far away,
so I'll just give you a lift.

404
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:37,000
Hop on, eh?

405
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:39,541
But I'm all out of money...

406
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:42,166
What the--?!
I don't take bribes!

407
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:43,625
[GOKU] Uhh...

408
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:02,166
You weren't fooling me
about being a friend

409
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:04,083
of that there girl's
there, were ya?

410
00:22:04,166 --> 00:22:05,541
No, I'm her friend!

411
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,916
[POLICEMAN]
That there's the place!

412
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,708
[GOKU] Here?

413
00:22:25,791 --> 00:22:27,375
Oh, wow!

414
00:22:27,458 --> 00:22:28,833
It's giant!

415
00:22:31,375 --> 00:22:33,250
[GOKU laughs]

416
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:36,750
Bullllll-maaaa!

417
00:22:38,125 --> 00:22:39,750
[NARRATOR] It's been a
new type of adventure

418
00:22:39,833 --> 00:22:42,541
for Goku finding
Bulma in this big city.

419
00:22:42,625 --> 00:22:45,000
But if she can fix
his Dragon Radar,

420
00:22:45,083 --> 00:22:47,666
he'll soon be back to the
business he knows best!

for the seven magic
Dragon Balls!
