1
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:17,250
[NARRATOR] Previously
on Dragon Ball, the long awaited

2
00:02:17,333 --> 00:02:20,208
World Martial Arts
Tournament finally started up!

3
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:21,750
From all across the globe,

4
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:24,125
fighters and fans
gathered to take part

5
00:02:24,208 --> 00:02:28,125
in the earth's craziest display
of Martial Arts know-how.

6
00:02:33,625 --> 00:02:34,750
[BULLHORN GUY] No pushing!

7
00:02:34,833 --> 00:02:36,375
It makes me nervous!

8
00:02:36,458 --> 00:02:37,750
I'm sorry but the audience

9
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:41,250
is not allowed inside
the elimination round area!

10
00:02:41,333 --> 00:02:43,500
It would be a major
fire hazard and--

11
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:44,750
Well then how
are we supposed

12
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:47,208
to see our friends
and boyfriends fighting?!!

13
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:49,791
Just close your eyes
and pretend you're there!

14
00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:02,000
[CHAIRMAN] Hello? Hello?

15
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:05,708
Testing, one... two... okay...

16
00:03:05,791 --> 00:03:07,458
Well... first we'd
like to thank

17
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:09,708
each one of you fighters
for coming all this way

18
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:12,583
to the Tournament because
of course if you didn't come

19
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:15,541
there wouldn't be much
of a show to watch...

20
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:17,666
If anyone here
is of the counting nature,

21
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,208
you may have noticed
that there are

22
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:23,541
one hundred and thirty seven
fighters packed into this hall,

23
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:25,166
representing countries
and species

24
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,625
from all over the world...

25
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:29,375
[KRILLIN] One hundred
and thirty seven??

26
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:32,541
And half of them have
kneecaps taller than I am!

27
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:39,375
[CHAIRMAN] Unfortunately...

28
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:41,625
Out of all you
guys here only eight

29
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:43,833
will get a chance to fight
in front of the crowds

30
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:45,125
in the Tournament finals!

31
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:47,291
So fight hard in
the elimination round

32
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:50,000
and let's try to
not have any whining!

33
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:56,500
Gee, what's the point of windows
when you can't reach them?

34
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:58,875
Change into a
stool or something!

35
00:03:58,958 --> 00:04:00,250
[OOLONG] Whoa Bulma!

36
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:02,250
I don't just change on
command! Get Puar to do it!

37
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:03,833
Don't be a baby Oolong!

38
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:07,208
I changed the last four
times! It's your turn!

39
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:09,083
Now get down there!

40
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:11,333
Come on...! Why me?!

41
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:13,208
I'll yell piggy!

42
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:14,833
[OOLONG thinking]
Some things never change...

43
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:18,083
the wicked mistress
and her poor pig slave...

44
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:20,833
Okay...! But I ain't
changing into a stool!

45
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:22,291
[BULMA] Fine. What ever.

46
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,000
[OOLONG thinking] Guess
that's why mountain climbers

47
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:32,916
don't wear skirts...

48
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,375
[BULMA] I still can't see!

49
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:36,250
Lift me higher!

50
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:40,291
Hey...! Move it!

51
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:44,291
[grunting]

52
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:46,500
[BULMA] I can see!

53
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:48,125
I can see inside!

54
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:49,000
[OOLONG] Great, Bulma.

55
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:50,708
That's the important thing...

56
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:55,166
I mean... who cares
if my spine's cracking...

57
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:57,000
[CHAIRMAN] Now listen
to the rules carefully

58
00:04:57,083 --> 00:05:00,958
because I can't stand
repeating myself...

59
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:03,500
You will be divided into
four tournament blocks

60
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:08,083
and the top two from each block
will advance to the finals.

61
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:13,458
[CHAIRMAN] We'll be
playing single elimination...

62
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:16,666
A person loses when they
land outside the ring,

63
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,666
lose consciousness,
or says "I give up."

64
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:22,500
But killing your opponent
is strictly forbidden.

65
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:25,500
Anyone who does so
will be disqualified!

66
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:27,291
And no weapons, either!

67
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:30,416
Claws may be used but
only if they're natural!

68
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,458
Fights that aren't
finished in under one minute

69
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:35,541
will be decided by points!

70
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:38,666
Now, please move to the
boxes and take a number...

71
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:41,708
You can look on the
boards to find your place.

72
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:43,833
And please, no trading...

73
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:51,416
[KRILLIN] Ninety three for me...

74
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,833
What did you get?

75
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:56,250
A... seven and a zero...

76
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:58,916
[YAMCHA] Looks like
you're both in block three.

77
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,416
Huh?

78
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,791
Oh no...!
That's bad...!

79
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:12,750
I don't want to
go up against Goku!

80
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:16,291
But we're on opposite ends
so you don't have to fight me!

81
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:17,875
[KRILLIN] Oh! Too bad...

82
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:20,041
[GOKU]
What's your number Yamcha?

83
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:21,833
I'm thirty five...

84
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:23,083
That's block two.

85
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:24,583
[GOKU] Is that good?

86
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:27,000
[YAMCHA] Actually it's just
perfect 'cause I didn't want

87
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:29,375
to be put in the same
tournament block as you.

88
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:30,833
[GOKU] But why not?

89
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:34,291
Ah... So you were
scared just like me!

90
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:35,625
That's not it...

91
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:38,041
I just want to wait
for the real tournament...

92
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:39,666
That's where the ring is bigger

93
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:42,375
and there's no time
limit to stop us...

94
00:06:42,458 --> 00:06:45,958
I've been waiting for this Goku,
so you better make it through...

95
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:48,375
Oh, I'll make it!

96
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:51,041
Well then, I'll see
you in the ring!

97
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:05,750
[KRILLIN] How in the world
can you and that Yamcha guy

98
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:07,833
be so confident...

99
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:09,833
...when we're
surrounded by like,

100
00:07:09,916 --> 00:07:12,375
twenty thousand
pounds of muscle?

101
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:13,833
'Cause none of
these guys were trained

102
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:16,000
by Master Roshi like we were!

103
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:18,750
But Goku, the old man
never taught us to fight!

104
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:21,208
He just gave us
dirt to move around!

105
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:23,916
Don't worry Krillin
I bet if we try hard enough

106
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,083
we'll be okay!

107
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:27,541
Right... Dandy...

108
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:32,166
Hello everyone, I'm going
to be your ref today

109
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:34,833
so if I could get
fighters number 69 and 70

110
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:37,166
into the ring now
that'd be super...

111
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:39,583
Hey... Seventy's my number...

112
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:40,916
Good luck, Goku!

113
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:43,208
Oh... Watch out...

114
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:46,875
We got a top competitor
from the diaper brigade!

115
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,541
I just hope he
doesn't make a mess

116
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:53,208
on the fighting ring floor...

117
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:54,791
Goku's already up...

118
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:56,208
Now I'll finally
have the chance to see

119
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:59,791
what fighting tricks he learned
from that crazy old man.

120
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:02,708
Look, it's Goku's turn!

121
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:07,875
[grunting]

122
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:09,958
Aaaah...

123
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:12,458
[OOLONG thinking] Well that's
an interesting angle...

124
00:08:15,791 --> 00:08:18,208
Oolong, just stay put!

125
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,916
It's too bad I'm not a pervert!

126
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:26,583
Eh. Where's my fighter?

127
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:28,083
[GOKU] Right here!

128
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:31,750
[MR. MUSTACHE]
What is this, a joke fight?

129
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:33,125
I've fallen on my rump

130
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:36,208
and squished bugs
bigger than you are!

131
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:38,041
Is that so?

132
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:42,041
You have one minute to fight...

133
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:44,333
Hah! I just need one second

134
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:48,625
to crush this pest between
my thumb and forefinger!

135
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:49,833
Begin.

136
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:54,708
Huh?

137
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:56,500
Oh, I really crushed him!

138
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:57,958
No, I'm okay!

139
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:10,750
Huh?

140
00:09:12,916 --> 00:09:16,541
[surprised murmuring]

141
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:18,041
Unreal!!

142
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:20,208
Mhmm!!

143
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:22,916
Awesome...!
Goku knocked him flat!!

144
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,166
[OOLONG] Careful!

145
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:26,666
Don't... look...!

146
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,833
Huh?

147
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:31,416
Hey... is there a
reason you keep acting

148
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,666
like a weirdo down there?

149
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:37,208
Number seventy advances...

150
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:39,458
Uh... Guys, what
just happened there?

151
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:43,250
The big oaf got carried
away and lost his balance!

152
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,208
That's what
I call embarrassing...!

153
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:47,791
Beat by a baby!

154
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:49,500
[YAMCHA thinking]
That was no accident...

155
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:52,208
Goku knocked him
down with one touch...!

156
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:55,375
Master Roshi's
technique, no doubt...

157
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:58,000
Wow...!

158
00:09:58,083 --> 00:10:00,291
It sure was lucky how
he fell out of the ring!

159
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:01,708
Not really...

160
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:03,875
What do you mean?

161
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:05,625
Krillin... I'm thinking
we shouldn't use

162
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:08,291
our full strength,
at least not yet...

163
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:10,250
Hold on... Why not?

164
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:12,416
It could be bad!

165
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,583
[ORIN PUPIL 1]
What do we have here?

166
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:17,083
It's our old punching bag!

167
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:20,041
H-Hello...

168
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:22,541
It's been a long time
since I've seen you Krillin,

169
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:25,250
when you ran crying out
of the Orin Temple!

170
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:26,625
[KRILLIN chuckles weakly]

171
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:27,500
But look...!

172
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:29,250
His new clothes are sooo pretty!

173
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:30,750
Now surely you're not trying

174
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:33,833
to fight in the World
Martial Arts Tournament!

175
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:37,791
[KRILLIN] Well yeah, um,
I was thinking about it...

176
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:39,250
How horrible...!

177
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:42,750
Making all these real fighters
waste their time on you!

178
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:44,333
[ORIN PUPIL 1] Have you
forgotten what we taught you?

179
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:46,833
That runts are always runts?

180
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:49,875
No... I remember...

181
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:52,666
[ORIN PUPIL 2] Oh look!
His number's 93!

182
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:55,916
Would you like to know who
your opponent's gonna be?

183
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,416
Uhhh...

184
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,083
You're lookin' at him!

185
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:01,083
Ehhh?

186
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:03,583
Just like old times... huh?

187
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:08,583
Just try not to be
too hard on me, Krillin!

188
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:14,958
Why'd you let them
talk to you like that?

189
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:16,333
Cause...

190
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:18,666
Cause everything they
say about me is right, Goku!

191
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,500
They've known me
longer than anyone.

192
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:22,583
They know the truth...

193
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:25,583
Maybe... I should drop out...

194
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:27,083
No, you won't...!

195
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:29,791
You're going to give
that guy all you've got!

196
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:32,000
But I thought
you said it'd be bad

197
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:33,916
if we used our
full strength here.

198
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,625
We'll take a time-out
from that rule

199
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:38,708
because those guys need to
know what you're made of...!

200
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:40,541
So you show 'em!

201
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:47,083
Hey...! There he is!
There's Yamcha!

202
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:48,500
Where...? Show me!

203
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:51,125
He's there by
the number 2 sign...!

204
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:52,791
You see him?

205
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:55,208
[BULMA]
Oh I found him! Yamcha!!!

206
00:11:58,083 --> 00:11:59,125
[BULMA] Hey sweetie!

207
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:01,625
Can you hear me! Yamcha!!

208
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:05,708
[BULMA] Come on Yamcha!

209
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:07,625
Don't you want to wave?

210
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:13,083
[OOLONG] Whoa there!!!

211
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:18,166
[OOLONG] Abandon ship!
Pig going down!

212
00:12:23,166 --> 00:12:24,958
My poor behind!

213
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:28,208
[BULMA] Aahh! I've gone blind!!

214
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:32,083
Aaa! Help me! There's
something on my face!

215
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:34,250
[MAN 1]
Would ya look at that...?

216
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:36,541
[MAN 2] I am! I am!

217
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:38,375
[BULMA] Somebody
give me hand...!

218
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:39,000
I can't see anything!

219
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:40,208
Hey!!!

220
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:42,583
What is this,
Peeping Tom day?!

221
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:46,333
It's you...!

222
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:48,416
Why wouldn't you just
let go of my face?!

223
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,125
I'm sorry... I grab
when I'm scared!

224
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:17,500
I just love... fighting!

225
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,958
Thanks... I am not
speaking to you Oolong.

226
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:22,458
[OOLONG] What?

227
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:24,875
After I defended you from
that drooling army of perverts?

228
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:26,583
Yeah, somehow I can't
see it as honorable

229
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:29,791
when you're getting
free looks of your own!

230
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:31,000
[OOLONG] Come on!

231
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:32,833
Just think of it as
payment for my services!

232
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:35,666
Well then I'm not
buying the ice cream!

233
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:39,500
Fine... Take checks?

234
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:41,708
So I wonder where
Master Roshi went, you guys.

235
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:43,791
He's been gone
for quite a while.

236
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:45,375
[BULMA] Humph!

237
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:47,875
That old creep's probably hiding
out in the ladies' rest room.

238
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:51,583
I'm more concerned about getting
to see that elimination round!

239
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:54,416
My shoulders are
officially off limits!

240
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,916
Oh, that's too bad.

241
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,208
I was gonna take you
to the candy store

242
00:13:57,291 --> 00:13:59,125
if you turned into a ladder.

243
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:00,916
Oooh baby!

244
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:07,958
[REFEREE] Gee we're really
making progress here aren't we?

245
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:12,166
Well let's get fighters number
93 and 94 in the ring please!

246
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:14,500
Oh gosh, that's me!

247
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:16,041
You can do it Krillin!

248
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:17,375
Right...

249
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:20,375
I have to admit that
I'm kind of jealous

250
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:22,250
you get to be
in the ring with him.

251
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:25,625
Don't worry. I'll give
'em a good slap for you!

252
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,750
I bet you'll be surprised
at what you can do!

253
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:31,291
Just give him a good tap!

254
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:33,208
I think my body went numb.

255
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:01,000
You didn't run
away this time...

256
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:02,833
I can't say that's
a healthy move,

257
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:05,166
but at least your
less of a chicken!

258
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,208
Beeeegin!

259
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:10,666
Which bone should I break first?

260
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:34,333
[screaming]

261
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:42,166
Huh?

262
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:46,458
Well, I'd say
93 is the winner...

263
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:48,041
You see?

264
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:50,625
Delivering milk and moving dirt
must be good training after all!

265
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:53,500
And I bet those guys won't
call you runt from now on!

266
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:54,791
Guess not...

267
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:58,625
Well Bulma,
I hope you're ready

268
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:02,333
to visit the candy store...!
Change now!

269
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:06,166
[OOLONG] To the windows, men!!

270
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:09,125
Hey look, there's
a hole in the wall!

271
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:13,750
Alright...!

272
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:16,250
So we don't need
you after all, Oolong!

273
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,208
[OOLONG thinking]
Who likes candy, anyway?

274
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:20,666
[BULMA] Look!
Yamcha's about to fight!

275
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:23,250
Yay! Go get him Yamcha!!!

276
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:35,500
Ha ha! I'll give you a freebie!

277
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:38,333
Just try and hurt me!

278
00:16:38,416 --> 00:16:40,375
[chuckles]

279
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:47,375
How's that...?

280
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:50,666
[BALD REFEREE] Knock out...!
35 advances!

281
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,750
[GOKU]
Yamcha's really doing well!

282
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:55,041
We've gotta' make
it to the finals now!

283
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:56,500
You bet!

284
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:57,833
[NARRATOR] And so it is!

285
00:16:57,916 --> 00:17:00,208
After months of
sharks and wasp bites,

286
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:01,916
Goku and Krillin are finally

287
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,875
putting Master Roshi's
training to the test!

288
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:07,708
And they're kicking
some serious butt!

289
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:17,500
Number 70 wins!

290
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,291
Yay Goku!

291
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:23,083
[REFEREE] Begin!

292
00:17:24,416 --> 00:17:26,333
[GOKU] Say...! Nice posture!

293
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:27,625
Thanks!

294
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:49,666
Krillin?

295
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,916
What are the chances
he'll live through that?

296
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Not too likely...

297
00:17:57,875 --> 00:18:01,708
Ha! Nice try...!
Sucker! Hahahaha.

298
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:03,041
Now let's see,

299
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:07,000
what sort of counterattack
should I use... Hmmm...

300
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:08,041
How did you...

301
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:10,958
That was my famous Dragon Stomp!

302
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:14,083
Right! Here I come!!

303
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:21,250
Okay, I give up!
I give up now!

304
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:24,875
Well that... was easy...

305
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:26,708
[NARRATOR]
And while the boys plowed

306
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:28,333
through the fighters in Ring 3,

307
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:32,000
Yamcha continued to
take victories of his own!

308
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:34,041
And their path to
the final Tournament

309
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:36,875
became more and more secure.

310
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,333
[NARRATOR] On and on,
knockout after knockout,

311
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:48,250
until the eliminations came down
to the final, deciding bouts!

312
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,125
Whoever wins this fight will be

313
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:55,416
the first from Ring Two
to advance to the finals!

314
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:59,333
Fighters 35 and 40,
please take your positions!

315
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:04,708
[GOKU] Do your best, Yamcha!

316
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:07,208
It's Wolf Fang Fist time!

317
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:10,708
You humans come up

318
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:14,458
with the wildest names to
make your moves sound tough...

319
00:19:14,541 --> 00:19:17,750
But I'll show you how
a real wolf attacks!

320
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:35,875
Oh my Yamcha!

321
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:40,333
Oh gosh...! Is he hurt?!

322
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,000
[BALD REFEREE] And that's a win!

323
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:52,666
35 has just earned a
spot in the big show!

324
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:56,000
Whoa...! Yamcha's
full of surprises!

325
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:58,083
That fight gave
me indigestion...

326
00:19:58,166 --> 00:19:59,166
He won!

327
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:01,958
I just knew he would!

328
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,041
Way to go!

329
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:06,791
Thank you...! Cool move, right?

330
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:08,166
Yeah!

331
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,250
[REFEREE] We're into the
final stretch, you guys...!

332
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:14,041
Fighters number 70 and 83
please come to the ring!

333
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:16,833
Winner of this match will
go on to the Tournament...!

334
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:18,208
How exciting!

335
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:20,083
That's my number!

336
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:22,083
Go get 'em!

337
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:23,916
You know it!

338
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:34,125
Goku! Throw him from the ring!

339
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:35,833
That sounds fun!

340
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:38,125
[LION FIST thinking]
And now for the sacred stance

341
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:40,625
of the Lion Fang Fist!

342
00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:41,916
Begin!

343
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:45,958
[LION FIST thinking]
What strange fighting posture!

344
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:48,291
He's unguarded on all sides!

345
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:51,541
Just come and hit me
if you want to, mister!

346
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:53,916
Where'd he go!

347
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,041
Head's up!!

348
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:03,583
Get ready!

349
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:05,375
Where's your technique?

350
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:11,958
[REFEREE] Out of
the ring! 70 advances!

351
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,916
You'll be in the
tournament for sure!

352
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,541
Those were
some nice moves!

353
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:21,250
It was so much fun!

354
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:23,250
[YAMCHA thinking]
I always knew Goku was strong,

355
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:25,291
but there's something
different now...

356
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:31,750
[REFEREE] Now for the last
match in the Ring 3 Bracket...!

357
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:34,750
Numbers 93 and 97 please report!

358
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:37,208
Okay...! Just take
care of this guy

359
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:39,625
and we'll go to
the finals together!

360
00:21:39,708 --> 00:21:41,166
Right!

361
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:45,541
Begin!

362
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,625
[BEAR] Make the pain stop...

363
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:01,625
[REFEREE] Fighter 97 surrenders!

364
00:22:01,708 --> 00:22:04,500
That means 90 is
on to the finals!

365
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:07,250
[KRILLIN] I did it! I did it!

366
00:22:07,333 --> 00:22:08,500
[GOKU and KRILLIN]
Going to the tournament!

367
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:10,916
We're going to the tournament!

368
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
[YAMCHA] And Krillin is
a good fighter, too...

369
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:15,166
This is gonna be a long day!

370
00:22:15,916 --> 00:22:18,541
So all of them
advanced...! Neat-o!

371
00:22:18,625 --> 00:22:20,458
I'm so happy!

372
00:22:20,541 --> 00:22:22,666
[ROSHI] So am I...!

373
00:22:24,583 --> 00:22:27,541
Well... About
time you showed up!

374
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:32,291
[NARRATOR] So the
elimination round has ended

375
00:22:32,375 --> 00:22:34,375
with quite favorable results...!

376
00:22:34,458 --> 00:22:38,541
Goku, Krillin, and Yamcha have
all advanced to the finals...!

377
00:22:38,625 --> 00:22:40,500
Soon they'll be fighting

378
00:22:40,583 --> 00:22:42,250
against the toughest
warriors in the world...!

379
00:22:42,333 --> 00:22:45,166
The ring will be bigger,
the time limit will be gone,

380
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:47,875
and there'll be thousands
of fans cheering them on!

381
00:22:47,958 --> 00:22:49,583
There's no doubt about it...

382
00:22:49,666 --> 00:22:53,541
The best is yet to come,
on Dragon Ball!
