00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,791
[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball,

2
00:02:15,875 --> 00:02:18,750
Goku fought Baba's masked
fighter in the final match

3
00:02:18,833 --> 00:02:21,958
to determine the fate
of the seventh Dragon Ball.

4
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:24,041
Goku held his own as he proved

5
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:27,375
that one Kamehameha wave
deserves another.

6
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:31,250
[NARRATOR]
Unfortunately, this adversary

7
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:33,250
knew Goku's one weakness.

8
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:35,125
Goku had him beat!
This isn't fair!

9
00:02:35,208 --> 00:02:37,083
It's not Goku's fault
he loses his power

10
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:38,833
when someone grabs his tail!

11
00:02:40,458 --> 00:02:42,916
[NARRATOR] The real shock
came when Master Roshi

12
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,750
revealed the secret identity
of the mysterious fighter...

13
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:50,583
Gohan, Goku's
deceased grandfather.

14
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:06,916
[PUAR] Someone should tell Goku!

15
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,875
No! This can't be happening!

16
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:12,458
Please don't tell me I'm looking
at some kind of ghost!

17
00:03:12,541 --> 00:03:15,416
Goku's grandfather
is most definitely dead.

18
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,500
That halo above his head
isn't just for decoration.

19
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:20,625
Somehow he's returned.

20
00:03:20,708 --> 00:03:22,583
Why is he hurting Goku?

21
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:24,166
I don't think
he came all this way

22
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:25,750
to harm his grandson.

23
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:35,000
[UPA] Oh, Goku!

24
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:41,708
[ROSHI thinking] Goku, you must
find the strength to hold on.

25
00:03:41,791 --> 00:03:43,208
If you give up now,

26
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:46,291
Gohan's visit will
have been for nothing.

27
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:40,375
Perfect.

28
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:41,750
With my new power suit,

29
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:44,958
I will rule the planet
and crush all who oppose me!

30
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:49,666
[SHU] Sensors indicate
that this is the location

31
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,708
of the Dragon Ball cluster.

32
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:55,000
Zoom in on Sector G-12.
Who is that?

33
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:01,916
It's that same
little brat as before!

34
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:04,125
[MASK MAN]
Oh, what a shame.

35
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:08,125
All your power wiped out
with one grasp of your tail.

36
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:09,916
So he does have a weakness.

37
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,333
Shu, we must inform
the Emperor at once.

38
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,708
Finally, victory
is within my sight!

39
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:23,166
[PILAF laughs]

40
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:25,166
Of course his tail
is his weakness.

41
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:26,333
I mean, look at it!

42
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:28,583
It doesn't even
go with his outfit!

43
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:30,958
We are now in
a perfect position

44
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:32,750
to exact our revenge
on the child

45
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:35,916
and take all six Dragon Balls
in one fell swoop.

46
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,458
His guard is down
and we have the advantage.

47
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,625
Sooner or later,

48
00:05:43,708 --> 00:05:45,708
that boy was destined
to fall at my feet.

49
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:48,208
I am Pilaf, the invincible!

50
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:50,625
Tonight, I sleep
without my nightlight!

51
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,250
Refreshing!

52
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:05,750
We must seek him out.

53
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:07,625
He certainly won't
be coming to us,

54
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:09,208
thanks to my specially designed

55
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:12,833
Compact Anti-Radar
Dragon Ball Shield Container!

56
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:15,375
Too bad the rights to
the word "lunch box" were taken,

57
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,958
but again, I prove
that nothing can stop me!

58
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:19,333
With my spy satellite,

59
00:06:19,416 --> 00:06:21,708
I can count every hair
on that brat's nappy head,

60
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:24,083
yet I could place this
Dragon Ball right under his nose

61
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:26,458
and he wouldn't even see it! Ha!

62
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:28,750
Emperor Pilaf,
when we located the boy,

63
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:30,000
he appeared to be fighting

64
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:32,375
in one of Fortuneteller
Baba's tournaments,

65
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:34,416
presumably to
receive aid in locating

66
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,541
the seventh Dragon Ball.

67
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:39,291
What if she tells him
where to find us, sire?

68
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:41,041
If she were a
real fortuneteller,

69
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:43,000
what's she doing stuck
in the middle of a pond?

70
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:45,250
Besides, look at the
size of her crystal ball.

71
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:47,333
She rides on it,
for goodness sake!

72
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:50,708
She's obviously
compensating for something!

73
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:53,791
And if for some reason
he gets lucky...

74
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:10,666
...my Power Suits
will reduce him to dust.

75
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,750
Right. Very well, sire.

76
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:14,625
Behold my brilliance!

77
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:16,125
These robotic behemoths

78
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:18,291
will assure my
ascension to greatness

79
00:07:18,375 --> 00:07:23,000
by laying waste to anyone
foolish enough to oppose me!

80
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:24,833
Don't just stand there.

81
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:27,625
Grab a suit and capsulize!

82
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:29,041
[BOTH] Yes, sire!

83
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:40,958
Once I have all seven
Dragon Balls in my possession,

84
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:44,250
the Eternal Dragon will be
under my complete control!

85
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:48,458
And if that big haired freak
so much as looks at me wrong...

86
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:53,333
Let's just say his short life
won't be getting any longer.

87
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:56,500
Mai, did you pack
my favorite sandwiches?

88
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:58,041
[SHU] Those were for you?

89
00:07:58,125 --> 00:07:59,416
[PILAF] Idiot!

90
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:18,833
[MASK MAN] Had enough?

91
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:21,583
Are you ready to surrender?

92
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:22,666
Be smart.

93
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,833
Give up while you
still have a face.

94
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:28,041
No... I will never give up...

95
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:30,583
[MASK MAN] Well, it's
your tail on the line, sonny.

96
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:33,250
No, no, no, no, no!

97
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:35,708
I can't watch this anymore!
This is insane!

98
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:38,750
How could he be so
cruel to his own grandson?

99
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:43,500
Stop it.

100
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:51,000
Hello! Roshi!

101
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:52,833
In case you hadn't noticed,
that's your student out there,

102
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:54,291
and if you don't
do something to save him,

103
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:56,333
he's the last
one you'll ever have!

104
00:08:57,875 --> 00:08:59,208
Goku needs help!

105
00:08:59,291 --> 00:09:01,958
I don't think he'll
last much longer.

106
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,000
But guys, we can't interfere.

107
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:04,958
It's forbidden.

108
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:06,625
If we do, he'll lose the match.

109
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:09,500
Right. Our helping Goku
now would ruin everything

110
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:11,875
that we've sacrificed
to get to this point.

111
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:14,916
Look at him! He's in pain!

112
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,125
We can't just stand here
and do nothing.

113
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:18,875
There's no other choice.

114
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:33,833
Is it... over?

115
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:36,083
[MASK MAN]
Your friends are loyal.

116
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:37,791
They care a lot about you.

117
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:41,458
[MASK MAN] Any one of them

118
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:44,083
would lay down their life
for you, without question.

119
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,500
Hello.

120
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,041
[BABA]
Could we get on with this?

121
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:58,875
I'm having my
ball waxed in an hour.

122
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:00,458
[MASK MAN]
Certainly, my dear Baba.

123
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:02,041
It's almost over.

124
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:05,041
The boy and I just have a few
more things to pound out first.

125
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:10,416
I've got it!

126
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,333
I know how we can help Goku!

127
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:13,708
We can call for a time-out.

128
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:15,750
They do it in other
sports all the time.

129
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:17,666
This way we're not
interfering with his match,

130
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,916
but we can still
let him have a break.

131
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,250
A break?
He's already broken!

132
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:23,666
Ha ha!

133
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:26,916
If he rests, he might be
able to get his strength back.

134
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,166
No.

135
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:31,625
No one is going to help Goku.

136
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:33,833
It is crucial
he faces his grandfather

137
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:35,416
without interruption.

138
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,666
This is ridiculous!

139
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:39,166
Goku doesn't even
know who he's fighting!

140
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:42,250
That fact will be revealed
in time, I assure you.

141
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:44,666
You must have patience, Bulma.

142
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:47,583
How much longer
can Goku hold on?!

143
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:48,916
[KRILLIN]
You mean how much longer

144
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,166
is his grandfather
gonna hold on?!

145
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,958
Gohan was not a reckless man.

146
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:55,125
We must have faith
in his judgment.

147
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:58,083
He won't give Goku any more
than he can handle.

148
00:10:58,166 --> 00:11:01,708
Goku will want to see
this fight through to the end.

149
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:02,833
But why?

150
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:04,333
Stop making excuses!

151
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:06,583
What his grandfather
is doing is cruel!

152
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:09,958
[PUAR screams]

153
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:11,708
[screaming]

154
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:13,166
[gasps]

155
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:14,625
[GOKU grunts]

156
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:17,083
What have you done?!

157
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:19,333
[GOKU screams]

158
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:21,000
[MASK MAN] That had to hurt...

159
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:24,708
At least you don't have to worry
about people pulling it anymore.

160
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:25,958
[GOKU] Ow! My tail!

161
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:27,791
Haha, I don't believe it!

162
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:29,666
The darn thing came clean off!

163
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,708
So much for that weakness, huh?

164
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:32,458
Wow!

165
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:33,750
Now he can win!

166
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:35,125
All right!

167
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:38,000
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

168
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:39,375
Easy, Goku!

169
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:43,291
[GOKU yelling]

170
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:58,458
[GOKU] Ow! It's sore!

171
00:11:58,541 --> 00:12:02,833
[GOKU yelps]

172
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:04,125
You meanie!

173
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:06,375
Why did you have to
go and take off my tail?!

174
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:08,375
That isn't fair
and you know it!

175
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:10,750
You're better!

176
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:12,375
Goku!

177
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:14,000
Beat him, Goku!

178
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:16,083
There's no weakness
to hold you back.

179
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:25,333
You won't trick me
like that again!

180
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,708
[MASK MAN] I surrender.

181
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:50,583
Did I just hear you right?

182
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:52,708
Did you say you surrender?

183
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,791
[MASK MAN laughing]

184
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,416
Hey, wait...

185
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,666
You're really telling
the truth, aren't you?

186
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:04,750
[MASK MAN] Of course I am.
I surrender. I am defeated.

187
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:06,291
Okay...

188
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:10,291
Did... he... just win?

189
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:17,708
This is most irregular.

190
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:19,458
[MASK MAN]
Goku, you have worked hard

191
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:22,541
and grown strong in
such a short amount of time.

192
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:25,125
How come you
already know my name?

193
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:26,958
[MASK MAN] Unfortunately,
you never mastered

194
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:28,208
your only weakness.

195
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:30,166
This tail would be
your undoing one day.

196
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:32,208
I always told you that.
Remember?

197
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:36,375
Wait a minute! Y-You're my--

198
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:37,500
[MASK MAN] Oh! Thank goodness.

199
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:39,875
I was so tired of
wearing this mask...

200
00:13:40,791 --> 00:13:43,541
Did the whiskers give me away?

201
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:45,583
Is that you, Grandpa?

202
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:47,291
Yes, it is you!

203
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:51,750
Grandpa! Grandpa!

204
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:55,166
That's right.
It's me, my boy. It's me!

205
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:56,958
I'm so happy
to see you, Grandpa!

206
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:58,875
I've missed you so much!

207
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:04,166
Where have you been?
I thought you--

208
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:10,166
[GOKU sobbing]

209
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:12,416
There, there now.
Stop your crying.

210
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:15,541
I looked everywhere
but I couldn't find you!

211
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:16,708
Goku...

212
00:14:16,791 --> 00:14:18,916
I've never seen him like this.

213
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
With all his strength
and accomplishments,

214
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:23,250
it's easy to forget
he's just a kid.

215
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:26,750
Goku! He's happy!

216
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:29,083
Goku, how's your
backside feeling?

217
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:30,500
Does it still hurt?

218
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:31,916
[GOKU]
Uh-uh.

219
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,250
I didn't mean to
break your tail, my boy.

220
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:35,916
I was just
trying to prove a point.

221
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,458
You have to learn
to protect your weaknesses,

222
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:41,583
like I always told you.
Now are you okay?

223
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:43,791
I'm all right, Grandpa.

224
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:45,708
Aside from that,
I must tell you,

225
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:47,791
I was impressed
by your strength.

226
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:50,416
I never expected you could
beat me in a match.

227
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:54,333
Have you been taking
lessons from Master Roshi?

228
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:55,791
Uh-huh.

229
00:14:58,458 --> 00:15:00,875
Master Roshi, it's an
honor to see you again,

230
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:02,208
my old friend.

231
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:04,416
[ROSHI] Likewise.
It's been a long time, Gohan.

232
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,833
I almost didn't recognize you
behind that silly mask.

233
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:11,416
Oh. Well, forgive my secrecy.
I thought it was necessary.

234
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,833
I was afraid if Goku
knew my true identity,

235
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:16,625
he would hold back
and not use his full power.

236
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:19,916
Yes, yes, I understand.

237
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,916
How else could you
have accurately measured

238
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,583
the boy's true growth?

239
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:24,958
[BULMA] Master Roshi.

240
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:26,125
What is it?

241
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:27,666
Correct me if I'm wrong,

242
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:30,750
but I thought you told us that
Goku's grandfather was dead.

243
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:35,083
Did... Did you really
come back to life, Grandpa?

244
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:37,833
Oh, no, Goku.
I didn't come back to life.

245
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:39,333
For the sake of not passing out,

246
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:41,333
I'll pretend
you didn't say that.

247
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:43,500
I'm talking to a dead man.

248
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:47,500
[BABA] Close your mouths
and open your minds.

249
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:49,750
I'll explain everything.

250
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:51,916
This world is divided
into two halves:

251
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,625
The Living World
and the Other World.

252
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:55,333
I can travel between both.

253
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:58,125
This comes in handy when
I'm recruiting new fighters.

254
00:15:58,208 --> 00:15:59,750
If I can't
find one on this side,

255
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:01,666
I just take a little road trip.

256
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,791
And that's where
she met up with me.

257
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:05,416
That's correct.

258
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,666
Now that you're here,

259
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,416
does that mean you can
come live with me again?

260
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,750
I'm afraid not.

261
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:12,375
The rules of inter-world
travel are very specific.

262
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:14,333
I've only got a one-day pass.

263
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:16,041
So do you think
that running into Baba

264
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:17,416
was just a coincidence?

265
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,541
[ROSHI] I don't think so.

266
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:20,375
Knowing my sister,
she knew full well

267
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:22,583
that Goku and his friends
were coming today.

268
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:24,083
[chuckling]

269
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:25,041
Correct.

270
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:27,083
That fortune was told long ago.

271
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:29,458
In fact, it was Gohan
who approached me,

272
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:32,833
asking if a young boy with
a tail would visit me someday.

273
00:16:32,916 --> 00:16:35,791
But I had no idea
Goku was his grandson.

274
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:36,875
Thanks!

275
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:38,625
I don't care
how you did it, Baba.

276
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:41,250
I'm just grateful that
you brought him back to me.

277
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:42,958
Of course.

278
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:46,875
I will always be
indebted you to, Master,

279
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:49,541
for taking on my
grandson as your pupil.

280
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:51,916
It is clear to me that,
under your guidance,

281
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,291
he has found a mentor.

282
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:56,708
Not only in martial arts,
but in life as well.

283
00:16:56,791 --> 00:16:58,250
No, no, no, no.

284
00:16:58,333 --> 00:17:01,375
You give me too much credit.
I only taught him the basics.

285
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:05,541
His strength is as much a
mystery to me as it is to you.

286
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:07,083
Thank you, my old friend.

287
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:11,041
Now I can return to
Other World with peace of mind.

288
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:12,875
Don't mention it.

289
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:14,041
Incidentally,

290
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:16,500
does Goku still
turn into a huge monster?

291
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:17,583
[ROSHI] Don't worry.

292
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:18,750
Since I broke the moon,

293
00:17:18,833 --> 00:17:20,875
everything has been
nice and peaceful.

294
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:22,500
Hey guys,
why are you whispering?

295
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,000
What's the big secret?

296
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:26,208
Nothing... Nothing at all.

297
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:28,208
I've got something
to show you, Grandpa.

298
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:29,958
I think you'll like it a lot!

299
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:31,041
[GOHAN] Goku?

300
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:32,333
Be right back!

301
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:45,500
Here it is!
Your four-star ball.

302
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:47,375
I've been saving it for you!

303
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:48,541
Oh, yes.

304
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:51,291
I picked up that doohickey
a long time ago.

305
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:52,583
It looks like you've been busy

306
00:17:52,666 --> 00:17:55,416
gathering quite a
collection, young man.

307
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,750
Actually, those balls have made

308
00:17:56,833 --> 00:17:59,791
a big impact on
your grandson's life.

309
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:02,500
Okay, I'll bite. Tell me more.

310
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:03,875
[BULMA] Certainly.

311
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:05,583
They're called Dragon Balls.
There are seven of them.

312
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:06,958
Very popular.

313
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:09,666
In fact, tracking them down
is how I first met Goku.

314
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,708
[BULMA] Right from the start,

315
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:16,833
I could tell there was
something different about him.

316
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:21,791
[BULMA] Goku was enthralled
by the Dragon Balls

317
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:23,666
and begged me to take him
along when he found out

318
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,541
I was searching for all seven.

319
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:27,125
I knew it might mean trouble,

320
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:30,666
but there's always danger when
you have a big heart like mine.

321
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:32,583
[BULMA] Throughout our travels,

322
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:34,708
he managed to make
a lot of friends...

323
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:37,916
[BULMA]
...some easier than others.

324
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,083
But even those he fought
eventually came around.

325
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:43,875
[BULMA]
Of course, there were a few

326
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:46,166
who were completely hopeless.

327
00:18:50,541 --> 00:18:52,125
[BULMA] Not everyone
who searched for the Balls

328
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:54,041
was as selfless as me.

329
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:55,875
Some were downright despicable!

330
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:04,541
[GOKU]
...me-ha!

331
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:10,625
[BULMA]
But no matter the danger,

332
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:13,291
and I must say
I'm most proud of this,

333
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:15,833
we did everything we could
to help out the innocent

334
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:17,541
and punish the morons.

335
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:28,708
[BULMA] And that's about it...

336
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:30,416
At least the good stuff.

337
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,000
[GOHAN] I see. Sounds exciting.

338
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:34,208
You've been very busy, Grandson.

339
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:35,708
Good thing you had
this young lady

340
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:37,416
to help you out
of those tight spots.

341
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,916
[chuckles]

342
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,333
See, you're in good hands.

343
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:42,416
Goku will bring your
father back, no problem.

344
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,666
Yes, but...

345
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:46,416
What's wrong? Goku won.
Aren't you happy?

346
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:50,208
How can I ask Goku
to bring my father back?

347
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:51,583
What about Gohan?

348
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:53,250
[laughs]

349
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:55,708
Don't worry about me.
I love it in Other World.

350
00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:57,666
I wouldn't leave it
for anything.

351
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:00,583
I've got a lot of friends,
and most of them are brunettes.

352
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:02,083
Save some for me.

353
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:03,333
Shut up!

354
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:04,750
In all these years you
haven't changed one bit,

355
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:06,125
you old air bag!

356
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:07,500
All this time
I've been looking

357
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:09,083
for something
redeeming about Baba,

358
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,916
and I think I just found it.

359
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,333
Ow! You left a mark!

360
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:15,166
Sad thing is,
that's all I can do.

361
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:16,791
One of life's little ironies...

362
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:18,375
It doesn't matter
how old you get,

363
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:21,666
you'll never be bigger
than your big sister.

364
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:23,333
Thank you very much, sir.

365
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:25,375
There's no thanks
necessary, my boy.

366
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:29,916
I'm just glad my grandson
could help you out.

367
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,333
I hate to break this up,
but my feet are killing me

368
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:35,375
and I can't rest until
I tell the boy his fortune.

369
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:37,625
Well, I guess you don't need
me around anymore,

370
00:20:37,708 --> 00:20:40,125
so I'll be taking my leave now.
It's been fun.

371
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:41,250
Wait! What do you mean?!

372
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:43,875
You can't leave yet, Grandpa.

373
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:45,916
Saying goodbye
is never easy, Goku.

374
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,291
But it is a necessary step

375
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:49,416
before we can say
hello again, and we will.

376
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,333
I promise.

377
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,791
Master Roshi, friends,
I would ask that you

378
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:56,166
look after my grandson
in my absence.

379
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,125
You are now his family.

380
00:20:58,208 --> 00:21:00,791
And Baba,
I appreciate this opportunity.

381
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:03,416
Yeah. Next time
you better not lose.

382
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:06,583
[GOHAN] You have a strong
heart and I'm proud of you.

383
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:09,833
No matter what happens in life,
always remember that.

384
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:15,458
[GOHAN] So long, everybody!
See you again in Other World!

385
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:17,916
Yeah, sounds great...

386
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,708
No offense, but I hope we
don't see you again too soon.

387
00:21:20,791 --> 00:21:21,458
[laughing]

388
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:22,541
[GOKU] Grandpa?

389
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:26,875
Grandpa, I...

390
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:28,958
I hope you have
a nice trip back.

391
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:32,583
Until we meet again. Sayonara.

392
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:36,416
So long, Gohan.

393
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:38,416
Grandpa!

394
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,583
I know my tail is going
to grow back again,

395
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:42,666
and when it does,
I promise you I'll train it

396
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:45,583
to be stronger than ever before!

397
00:21:45,666 --> 00:21:47,541
If you can grow it
as strong as your lungs,

398
00:21:47,625 --> 00:21:49,458
you've got nothing
to worry about.

399
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:54,208
I'm telling your fortune
if anyone's interested.

400
00:21:54,291 --> 00:21:56,000
Listen, crystal, hear my call!

401
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:58,666
Where can I find
the Seventh Dragon Ball?!

402
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:02,250
Tell me now, tell me true,
show me what I ask of you!

403
00:22:06,875 --> 00:22:08,166
Let's see.

404
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:10,916
Huh... It's moving.

405
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,833
Moving where?

406
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:15,458
[BABA] Look into my
crystal ball. It's all there.

407
00:22:15,541 --> 00:22:16,666
As you can plainly see,

408
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:18,541
the seventh Dragon Ball
is being transported

409
00:22:18,625 --> 00:22:21,250
in that red automobile.

410
00:22:21,333 --> 00:22:22,416
This is strange.

411
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,500
If the Dragon Ball
truly is in that car,

412
00:22:24,583 --> 00:22:26,833
why doesn't it
show up on the radar?

413
00:22:26,916 --> 00:22:28,875
Where is the car?
Please tell me.

414
00:22:28,958 --> 00:22:29,750
I need to know!

415
00:22:29,833 --> 00:22:31,250
Easy. Calm down.

416
00:22:31,333 --> 00:22:34,625
It's headed in that direction.
It's about 200 miles away.

417
00:22:34,708 --> 00:22:36,833
It's close.
Did you hear that, Upa?!

418
00:22:36,916 --> 00:22:38,666
It won't be long now
and you'll be back together

419
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:40,000
with your father.

420
00:22:40,083 --> 00:22:42,083
Great!

421
00:22:42,166 --> 00:22:44,125
[NARRATOR] The location
of the last Dragon Ball

422
00:22:44,208 --> 00:22:45,500
has been revealed.

423
00:22:45,583 --> 00:22:48,625
Unfortunately, Goku must go
through Emperor Pilaf

424
00:22:48,708 --> 00:22:51,333
and his destructive
Power Suits to get it.

425
00:22:51,416 --> 00:22:55,083
The adventure continues,
next time on Dragon Ball!
