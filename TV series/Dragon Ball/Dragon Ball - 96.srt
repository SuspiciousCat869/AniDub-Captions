[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball,

2
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:16,791
the Sixth Match of the
tournament series began

3
00:02:16,875 --> 00:02:19,833
as fellow Turtle Hermit
students Goku and Krillin

4
00:02:19,916 --> 00:02:23,875
engaged in a friendly,
but volatile slugfest.

5
00:02:26,875 --> 00:02:29,416
[NARRATOR] Punch-for-punch,
the amicable adversaries

6
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:32,833
stood their ground,
and occasionally left it.

7
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:40,458
I'll show how anti-hero I
can be when I destroy Goku.

8
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:47,875
[NARRATOR]
The battle went on and on,

9
00:02:47,958 --> 00:02:50,000
with both opponents
taking their knocks...

10
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:52,041
and getting their kicks!

11
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:19,250

14
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:44,625
Puar, could you
whimper someplace else?

15
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:47,166
I can't help it.
Fighting scares me.

16
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:50,208
The fight's nothin'!
I'll tell ya what's scary.

17
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:50,791
What?

18
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:52,708
Your ugly face.

--[BULMA grunts]

This is serious.

00:03:58,791 --> 00:04:01,708
[OOLONG] The sad thing is,
these are my friends.

22
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:13,833
Hm! You got me that time!

23
00:04:13,916 --> 00:04:18,041
Neat trick! I've never seen
anybody do that before.

24
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:20,708
Hm! I didn't have much choice.

25
00:04:20,791 --> 00:04:23,083
You rebounded pretty quickly.

26
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:26,375
You looked funny,
what's the name of that move,

27
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:27,625
the balloon technique?

28
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:29,208
Maybe. I'm not sure.

29
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:31,666
I've never named
a technique before.

[CROWD cheering]

31
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:38,125
Why is everybody cheering?

32
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:40,375
All they're doing
is talking to each other!

33
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:43,083
I've seen more action
on a playground.

34

[DOG BOY]
How does he do that?

35
00:05:05,458 --> 00:05:07,291
[ROSHI] I must say,
both those boys

36
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:09,416
are in excellent form today.

37
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,250
Still, I can't
help but wonder

38
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:14,208
if Goku isn't
holding back a bit.

Ah... It looks... painful.

Uh--I mean, it looks
like Krillin is down!

start the countdown?

[ANNOUNCER] In what can only
be described as astounding,

61
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:43,500
Krillin has bounced back from
Goku's jaw-breaking assault!

62
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:45,375
That was close!

Come on, you didn't think
I'd let you win that easy!

It's like watching
a bad reunion!

68
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:04,958
If your pupils weren't
maladjusted freaks,

maybe they'd be happy too!

I'm happy, see.

00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:14,333
Of course. Pay them no mind.
Those underlings are jealous.

Jealous?! Our boys are
going to take yours down,

73

and you know it!

Oh, kids today...
They're so predictable.

Maybe you can see better.

yourself! You can do this.

All you need
is a good strategy.

Why am I talking to myself
in the second person?

And... for most
improved fighter,

Or at least it should.

one way to win this!

prepare yourself!

doesn't work on me.

just waste more energy.

Sorry, Goku.
But let's face it,

your tail is
your only weakness.

Neat trick, huh? I knew
the Kamehame-ha Wave

115
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:26,750

could sneak up from behind!

that are unclear,

to get in the way.

165
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:17,916
But Master Roshi told me the
only way I'd make things better

166
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,708
was to work it out,
so I did!

167
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:22,375
It's typical.

168
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:26,375
Go ahead and squeeze
it again. It's okay.

169
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:27,458
[ROSHI]
I think I did mention

170
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:29,458
something about
that in passing.

171
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:31,875
What do ya know,
they do listen!

172
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:46,458
[ROSHI] To have come so far
in three years is amazing.

173
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:50,041
He must have been on one heck
of a calisthenics program!

174
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:51,708
I shouldn't be surprised.

175
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:54,416
If Goku's tail is
his greatest weakness,

176
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:58,041
his determination is by far
his greatest strength.

177
00:14:58,125 --> 00:15:00,250
Why, I imagine
that little boy could do

178
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:03,500
just about anything
he put his mind to.

179
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:16,875
[GOKU chuckles]

180
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:18,750
[ROSHI] He certainly
proves my point.

181
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:22,625
Success is more try than cry.

[KRILLIN whimpers]

184
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:35,041
Too bad for Krillin.

185
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:37,875
How do you fight a warrior
without a weakness?

186
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:40,000
[GOKU laughs]

187

Hey! That wasn't fair!

188
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:50,875
Fair is not on today's menu.

189
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:52,958
That wasn't nice!

190

In case you hadn't noticed,
I'm not here to be nice!

Oh no, here we go.

Tear it up, Krillin! Do it!

Another strong attack by
the ever-surprising Krillin!

I hope everyone else saw that.

Goku! Where are you?!

[ANNOUNCER] In what is
arguably the most

215
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:08,541
amazing feat ever
performed on this stage,

216
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:12,708
Goku has disappeared
right before our very eyes!

217
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:16,250
This isn't funny!

218

Cut it out! Goku!

Since when could he disappear?
It's astounding!

222
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:38,125
I've witnessed people
disappearing before,

but never for
this length of time.

Wait!

226
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:03,958
[TIEN] It's his speed!
He's moving so fast,

227
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:07,083
it gives the illusion
that he's disappeared!

228
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:10,458
What a fantastic way to
disorient your opponent.

229
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:13,416
Is there no end
to this boy's skill?!

It's a flawless approach!

All right!
[laughs]

239
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:10,375
Krillin, who seemingly
dominated Goku

240
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:12,208
throughout most of
the fight, now appears

241
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:15,500
completely flabbergasted
after his fall from the ring!

242

to a sensational match!

It's over?!

The fight was anticlimactic
and completely void

of any cathartic experience.

I didn't understand
a word you said.

247
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:34,583
[TIEN] The poor reaction
from the audience

248
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:38,250
is further evidence
of Goku's brilliant attack.

249
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:40,833
For while they focused
on his scare tactic,

250
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:44,583
they missed the eight punch
assault that followed.

251
00:20:46,708 --> 00:20:49,208
Not to mention the
power-kick that sent Krillin

252
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:51,708
flying out of the ring.

it will be your last.

Throughout the tournament,

Goku has demonstrated
remarkable progress.

it's enough to get him

next battle... alive.

lost the match, Krillin.

[KRILLIN] Mm. That's okay.
You were the better fighter.

265
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,291
Besides, I told myself I'd do
my best and that's what I did.

266
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:35,958
But I do have one question...

00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:37,208
What?

00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:39,416
[KRILLIN] How did you do
that disappearing thing?

[GOKU] No problem.
I'll tell you all about it.

Listen, I just wanna let
you know... that I think

both of you did
an exceptional job.

You're exceptional. Don't
argue, I'm bigger than you.

a great left hook!

The risks for our hero
have never been higher.

If Goku doesn't
walk away with the title,
