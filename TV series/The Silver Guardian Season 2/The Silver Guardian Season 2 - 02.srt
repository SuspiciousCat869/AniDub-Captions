I also had them sign

emailing the transfer rings
to the players.

about some new guardian
wandering around.

But how?

167
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:32,666
Even after I charged a hundred
million into that last attack!

168
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:33,916
He’s a nobody!

169
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,708
There’s no way
this part-time player

170
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:37,083
could have more money,

171
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:39,208
could be richer than Titan!

172
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:40,541
You beat him like
he was nothing!

173
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:42,041
Exactly how much do you have

174
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:43,416
invested in this game, huh?

175
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,791
I can’t disclose
that information.

176
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:47,666
But Titan’s assets
are zeroed out.

177
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,083
Pretty sure he’s finished.

178
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:50,333
Poor guy.

179
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:51,916
That’s great and all,

180
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,625
but I think you’re forgetting
about what happens next!

181
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:55,375
-We’re in trouble.
-We're in trouble.

182
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:57,125
The Item’s gonna detonate!

183
00:09:57,208 --> 00:09:59,041
And the more money
you spent on it,

184
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:01,000
the bigger the explosion.

Do me a favor and get off me.

Yeah, um.

189
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:14,708
So, all that’s left

190
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:16,125
is for us
to log out, right?

191
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:17,875

194

Someone will eventually
come save us.

195

[FARIN]
What do you mean, “eventually?"

196

[SUIGIN] Before we log off,
I wanted to know...

200
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:43,000
you have some kind of ability
to analyze

201
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:44,666
your opponent’s Buster Item.

202
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,041
You used it on me, right?

203
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:48,083
And if I did,
what’s the big deal?

204
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:50,583
It's not.
I just think it’s pretty cool.

205
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:52,083
Huh?

206
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:54,666
I know you’ve got a bunch
of other friends, Farin,

207
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:57,500
but I really would love
for you to be on my team.

208
00:10:57,583 --> 00:11:00,125
Hold on, this is all moving
so quickly.

209
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:02,250
Do me a favor
and just think about it?

210
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:04,791
I’ll put my address
in your Seabay.

211

Let me know what you decide.

Sorry, I’ve got too many people
in my address book.

Hello, darlings.

[SUIGIN]
Farin.

225
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:49,000
We did complete the
beginners’ course, right?

226
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,625
There were no tasks left?

227
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:52,250
[FARIN]
Uh. Yeah.

228
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:54,041
[SUIGIN]
Then what’s this doing here?

229
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:01,666
I’ve finally find you.

230
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,333
To think of all places,

231
00:12:03,416 --> 00:12:06,458
you’d be in a beginner’s course
flirting with a loli.

232
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:09,208
Not what I expected,
Suigin Riku.

233
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,500
She just called you
by your full name.

234
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:13,916
Do you know her?

235
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,583
No. But I’m curious
to find out who she is.

236
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:18,208
Where do you think you’re going!

237
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:19,666
Hold on a minute!

238
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:20,833
Suigin!

239
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,125
It’s fine.

240
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:26,125
Still, why are you so worried
about me all of a sudden?

241
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:28,791
Because she’s not
an ordinary player!

242
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:29,791
In fact,

243
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:31,125
when I used my Probing Eye

244
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:32,625
to uncover more info,

245
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:34,416
there wasn’t any data!

246
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,791
What I do know is someone
with a Divine Tomb weapon

247
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:38,541
will give off
a flame-like aura.

248
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:41,583
Players should only be able to
have one Divine Tomb item each.

249
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:42,958
But, when I look at her,

250
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:45,041
I don’t see a player
with a single flame.

251
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:47,666
She’s got a total of ten
surrounding her!

252
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:50,541
I heard there’s a sole
individual who has this ability.

253
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:52,041
One of the Billion Players.

that doing here?

00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,958
It’s the beginning of the end.

328
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:26,416
Let’s move on, driver.

329
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,416
[hooves clopping]

330
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,125
Hey! I wasn’t finished
talking with you!

331
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:32,958
Tell me where Temujin is!

332
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:36,708
No need for you to worry.

333
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:38,500
Even if you don’t know
where to look,

334
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:41,500
I guarantee your paths
will cross sooner than later.

[shot fires]

336
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:47,041
Huh?

-[shot fires]

338
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:50,333
[SUIGIN]
Incredible.

339
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:52,208
Is that her true power?

340
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:01,291
[FARIN coughing]

341
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:02,333
You’re awake!

342
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:04,166
You okay, Farin?

343
00:16:05,416 --> 00:16:06,333
Are you hurt?

344
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:08,333
Suigin. What just happened?

345
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:09,250
[SUIGIN]
Don’t worry.

346
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:10,541
The Collector’s gone.

347
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:13,250
Do you have any idea
what she was after?

348
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:15,583
While I’m not entirely certain,

349
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:18,583
whoever is watching us might be
able to shed some light on it.

350
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,083
[footsteps]

351
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:30,500
The real question is how long
he’s been tracking us.

352
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:34,000
He must be why the Collector
said “the walls have ears."

353
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:35,416
Hold on.

354
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,541
I’m gonna take a closer look
at his abilities.

355
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:39,458
[SQUARE BIRD] I told you
not to let them spot you.

356
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:41,666
But do you ever listen to me?
No.

357
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:45,041
The boss specifically told you
to discreetly monitor them.

358
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:48,291
How do you expect to do that
standing in the open like this?

359
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:49,916
[KITAKAZE]
No choice now but to kill them.

360
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,708
Great idea, Kitakaze!

361
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:53,541
Murder ‘em
and then collect intel!

362
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:56,416
There’s something very strange
about that cube-shaped owl.

363
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,833
Don’t let your guard down.

364
00:16:57,916 --> 00:17:00,000
Whoever he is, he doesn’t
have a Tomb Weapon,

365
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:02,333
but his power’s
the same level as Wild Wolf.

366
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:05,541
Or possibly even stronger!

367
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:06,458
What?

368
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:07,375
No way!

369
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:08,333
He’s...

370
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:10,208
He’s one of the Totems.

371
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:13,541
Meaning he knows Temujin.
Not to mention,

372
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:16,291
the place where
they’re holding Rei Riku!

373
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:17,291
Wait, Suigin!

374
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:18,583
Don’t go!

375
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:19,708
[SQUARE BIRD]
That reckless idiot

376
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:21,250
is running right towards us.

377
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:23,625
We’d better make like a tree
and get out of here!

378
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:25,708
[KITAKAZE] You're sure
I'm not allowed to kill him?

379
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:27,833
If you think so,
you’re dumber than the kid!

380
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:29,125
Hurry up and move!

381
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:32,958
Hey!
Hang on!

382
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,958
You’re not going until you
tell me where Rei is!

383
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,041
What was that move
you just used?

384
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:48,333
You managed to close
the distance

385
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:50,500
between us
without much difficulty.

386
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:52,458
Remember, Kitakaze,
don't lose your cool

387
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:55,375
over a persistent brat like him.

388
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:57,541
You’re one of the Totems, right?

389
00:17:57,625 --> 00:18:00,083
Tell me what you know
about Rei Riku.

390
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:02,958
Nothing in my orders state
that I have to answer you.

391
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:08,375
Then I’m afraid I can’t let you
go anywhere until you do!

392
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:10,166
What a fool this one is.

393
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:11,500
[yelling]

394
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:13,666
What the--?

395
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:18,041
Please, Suigin.

396
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:20,333
Surely you can move faster.

397
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:23,000
I gotta try fighting this guy
using some different technique

398
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:25,500
or the battle isn’t going
to last much longer.

399
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:31,750
[KITAKAZE]
Too slow.

400
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:33,916
[SUIGIN]
Damn it!

401
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:36,625
[SUIGIN]
His speed.

402
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:38,416
I can’t escape him!

403
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,791
[KITAKAZE]
Xiao shi ba.

404
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:42,166
Ah, yes.

405
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:44,375
I almost forgot about
the other nuisance.

406
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:45,666
Why did you--?

407
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,666
Are you just gonna
stand there all day?

408
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:50,083
If you can’t win,
then hurry up and run away!

409
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:51,750
[KITAKAZE] Now that
you've got me worked up,

410
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:54,083
I’m afraid I can’t let
either of you escape.

411
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,708
[SUIGIN]
We’re no match for his speed.

412
00:18:58,791 --> 00:19:00,166
What was your first hint?

413
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:01,916
This ain’t gonna be easy.

414
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,958
We’re up against a
high ranking Totem!

415
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:05,125
[SUIGIN]
True.

416
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:06,416
So why’d you even rescue me?

417
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,583
Well, uh,

418
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:09,125
because as a member
of your team,

419
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:10,791
it wouldn’t be right to just

420
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:12,791
stand by and watch you die.

421
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:14,333
[SUIGIN]
Thanks, Farin.

422
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:16,833
You’re an official party
member now.

423
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:19,000
Which means I look
out for you, too.

424
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:21,083
Here he comes.

425
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:22,333
Unreal.

426
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:24,166
His attack speed
is off the charts!

427
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:26,625
I can’t even tell the number
of times I’ve been hit!

428
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:27,875
Damn.

429
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:29,291
If I don’t log off,
there’s no way

430
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:31,500
I’ll be able to reset
my item’s abilities.

431
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:44,166
After that hack and slash,
I think we’re almost done here.

432
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:46,208
Given the boss’ interest in him,

433
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:48,291
I would have thought
he’d be more of a challenge.

434
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:51,000
But no, this is disappointing.

435
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:52,291
I’m bored.

436
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:54,000
Let’s get this over with
and leave.

437
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:57,166
[SUIGIN]
What’s this number on our hands?

438
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:59,708
Does it have to do with the
amount of times we were hit?

439
00:19:59,791 --> 00:20:01,333
I’m not positive, however,

440
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:04,375
there could be some kinda
magical effect tied with it.

441
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:06,208
It’s not just for decoration.

442
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:09,666
There’s only one way to be sure!

443
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:13,833
[KITAKAZE] You walked
right into that, Suigin.

444
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:18,291
Managed to dodge him.

445
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:21,416
What’s going on?

446
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,250
The guy didn’t even hit me!

447
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,875
It’s your turn.

448
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:29,916
Gotta time this just right.

449
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:33,875
Now I get it.

450
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:35,875
If you get cut a
certain number of times,

451
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:38,041
then the game
will force you to log off.

452
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:40,166
[KITAKAZE]
You finally figured it out.

453
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:42,000
But it won’t do you
any good now.

454
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:46,416
But I kept his last attack
from striking me!

455
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,250
Dodge all you want.

456
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:50,250
It doesn’t make a difference.

457
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:52,041
[KITAKAZE]
Disappear.

458
00:20:57,666 --> 00:20:59,666
[shimmering]

459
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:00,708
[SUIGIN sighs]

460
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:01,750
Damn it.

461
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:03,625
Who was that cheater?

462
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:05,958
That forced log out is gonna
keep me from signing in

463
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:07,750
for a full 24 hours.

464
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:11,583
Looks like Farin got the boot,
same as me.

465
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:13,333
[phone rings]

466
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:16,583
Hey, Farin.

467
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:18,125
You, too?

468
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:19,125
[TEMUJIN]
Ah.

469
00:21:19,208 --> 00:21:20,833
So Farin is the name

470
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:23,416
of your new girlfriend,
Suigin Riku.

471
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,958
Good to know.

472
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:26,250
Who’s this?

473
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:28,291
Better yet, how did
you get my name?

474
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:30,333
None of that matters.

475
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:34,916
But listen close,
and I’ll tell you what does.

476
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,541
Assuming you are interested
in saving this woman.

477
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:40,250
Suigin!

478
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:45,958
The Silver Guardian!
