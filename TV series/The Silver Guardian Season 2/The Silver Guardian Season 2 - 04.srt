1
00:01:51,375 --> 00:01:53,083
Who are you?

2
00:01:56,708 --> 00:01:58,000
Get off him!

3
00:01:59,791 --> 00:02:01,416
Did she hurt you, Suigin?

4
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,125
[SUIGIN]
Yeah, she freakin’ hurt me.

5
00:02:13,916 --> 00:02:15,666
It appears our data was right.

6
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,250
You’re the player they call
Suigin Riku.

7
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:20,750
That’s one hell of a warm
welcome you got there!

8
00:02:20,833 --> 00:02:23,750
Do you greet everyone
the same way or just me?

9
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:25,541
Don’t let your guard down,
Suigin.

10
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:27,250
This girl’s stronger
than she looks.

11
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:28,291
Yeah.

12
00:02:28,375 --> 00:02:29,708
I have a message.

13
00:02:29,791 --> 00:02:31,458
Even though my boss
clearly instructed me

14
00:02:31,541 --> 00:02:32,791
not to approach you,

15
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:34,958
I’m not one
for following orders.

16
00:02:35,041 --> 00:02:36,583
I imagine if you’ve
come this far,

17
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:38,375
you’re dying to see her again.

18
00:02:39,458 --> 00:02:41,166
Evil Mirror, manifest.

19
00:02:43,958 --> 00:02:45,083
A mirror?

20
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:46,458
Now what?

21
00:02:51,708 --> 00:02:54,083
Who is she?

22
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,750
That’s Rei.

23
00:03:06,291 --> 00:03:08,375
You don’t know how much
I’ve missed you!

24
00:03:08,458 --> 00:03:09,916
[heavy breaths]

25
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,541
Rei!
It’s me!

26
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:12,791
Suigin!

27
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:14,500
If you hear me, give me a sign!

28
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:16,583
Wherever you are,
I’ll rescue you!

29
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:17,875
Are you close?

30
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:19,708
Tell me where
they’re keeping you!

31
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:21,625
If you’re being held
at the Totems' headquarters

32
00:03:21,708 --> 00:03:23,250
I need you to tell me
where it is!

33
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:24,500
Rei!

34
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,208
Can you hear me?

35
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:31,041
Behind you!

36
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:35,541
Rei.

37
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:36,958
Please.

38
00:03:38,916 --> 00:03:39,916
Don’t worry.

39
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,500
I’ll find you.

40
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:44,166
I know it’s taken me a while
but I will get you out.

41
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:46,125
And when I find the person
who put you there,

42
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:47,750
they’re gonna regret it.

43
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:50,000
Please just hang on
a little bit longer.

44
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:52,750
We’re gonna get you back home
no matter what it costs.

45
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:56,416
[REI] Poor Maki must be worried
after I disappeared so suddenly.

46
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,416
I haven’t contacted
the school, either,

47
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,916
so I definitely fell
behind in my classes.

48
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,875
And then I still have
to sort through

49
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:04,500
all of my father’s belongings.

50
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:06,166
None of that matters right now!

51
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,833
First, let’s worry
how to break you out, Rei!

52
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:11,958
Wait, do you even see me or hear
anything I’m saying?

53
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:13,500
Please don’t go, Rei!

54
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:14,916
Come back!

55
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:17,250
Suigin?

56
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:19,291
Is that you, Suigin?

57
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:21,708
I’m right here on the other side
of the mirror, Rei!

58
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:23,500
We’re on our way to save you!

59
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:26,291
[NISHIKAZE]
Enough sentimentality.

60
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:28,541
I hope you enjoyed
your brief reunion.

61
00:04:28,625 --> 00:04:30,208
So you know.

62
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:32,875
My boss also said you’re quite
the exceptional player,

63
00:04:32,958 --> 00:04:35,208
which I find hard to believe.

64
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:38,166
It’s time to see
what you’re made of.

65
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,291
[SUIGIN]
Bring her back!

66
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:41,666
Suigin!

67
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:45,291
[SUIGIN]
I’m okay, Farin.

68
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:47,416
I assume this girl’s Nishikaze.

69
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:50,375
She’s the one the guy
on the phone told me to find.

70
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:52,375
What a relief I found you.

71
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:54,333
Tell me what your group
is after!

72
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:56,166
Why won’t you let Rei go?

73
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,250
You’re a quick study, Suigin.

74
00:04:58,333 --> 00:05:00,583
Yes.
I am Nishikaze.

75
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:02,083
I apologize for attacking you

76
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:04,291
but I needed to test
the strength of your Divine

Tomb Item

78
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:06,458
[PLAYER 1]
Hey, guys?

79
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:07,541
Where’d the boss go?

80
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:09,083
[PLAYER 2]
Not a clue.

81
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:11,291
[PLAYER 3] Has anyone
ever fought so overpowered?

82
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:12,708
[PLAYER 4]
Stay sharp.

83
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:14,833
We may not get far
with what we have equipped.

84
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:17,083
Yeah. I got it.

[ASLAN]
None of your blood...

00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:27,208
is what I seek!

90
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:29,083
[PLAYER 2] We don't
stand any chance against him!

91
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:30,041
Retreat!

92
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:31,583
[PLAYER 3]
Save yourselves!

93
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:32,875
How pathetic.

94
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:35,458
I have no interest
in weaklings like you.

95
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:37,416
Time to thin the herds.

96
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,625
At least I can promise a show.

97
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:41,166
With my summoning attack.

98
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:43,708
Your deaths will
be spectacular.

Demons in the sea of blood,
reveal yourselves!

Uh, guys.
You see what I’m seeing?

102
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:52,250
Those shapes.

103
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:53,750
There’s something alive
in the blood,

104
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:55,291
swimming right beneath our feet!

105
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:56,458
[PLAYER 5]
Don’t just stand there!

106

[PLAYER 6]
Move into formation D!

107
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:03,583
I saw this in a horror
movie before!

108
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:05,083
And how did it end?

109
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:07,000
They were so busy looking down
they didn’t notice

110
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:09,041
the real threat was coming
from above them!

111
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:11,333
But that was a movie.

112

[PLAYERS yelling fearfully]

113
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:15,416
What the hell is it?

00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,250
A blood-sucking freak!

These are my faithful servants.

They’ll bleed you dry.

118
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:30,041
So if you want to live,
I suggest you flee.

119
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:36,875
Anyone unfortunate enough
to get pierced by my minions,

120
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:39,583
will transform into
a droplet of blood.

Spheres of energy I absorb
and then convert into bone.

122
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:47,125
Now go.

123
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:49,125
Drain them for everything
they’re worth,

124
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:51,333
so they may merge with me!

Despite such a generous harvest,

the blood I seek continues
to elude me.

[NISHIKAZE]
Then it is true.

I’ve seen it for myself.

136
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:22,708
That’s Yuuki Riku’s wave.

137
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:24,333
My boss sends a message.

138
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:26,291
Since I’ve confirmed
your Buster Item,

139
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:29,250
proceed to Stage Zero
as soon as possible.

I’d love to but I heard

it was supposed to open
five days from now.

A rumor, nothing more.

143

You can enter
if you have the key.

144

I can feel it waiting up ahead.

I’ve long been searching for.

You don’t realize how long
I’ve waited for this moment.

Wait?
For me?

00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:07,625

To fulfill the mission.

156
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:13,583
Those were the orders given

[SUIGIN]
You lost me.

158
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:17,083
[ASLAN]
First off, this is yours.

159
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:20,916
The key is built to activate
in response to your blood alone.

160
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,833
Use it to enter
Stage Zero, Chosen One.

161
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:27,916
Once you arrive, your long
dormant memories of the Stage

162
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,916
will finally be reawakened.

163

But in order for that to happen,

164
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:33,833
you must undergo
one final challenge.

165

[SUIGIN]
What the--?

166
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,500
[explosion]

167
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:51,833
[FARIN]
He looks completely different!

168
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:54,625
Are we fighting
a separate boss or something?

169
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:57,208
[NISHIKAZE] Allow me to present
Aslan’s ultimate form.

170
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:01,375
Bloody Buddha.

171
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:02,375
[PLAYER 8]
Up there!

172
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:04,208
Those players are goners!

173
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:12,458
Look it!

174
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:14,125
There’s something inside
the boss’s stomach!

175
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:17,625
Suigin Riku, tell me
if you recognize this.

176
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:20,791
I, uh, would have to guess
that’s the boss’s weak point?

177
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:23,958
In other words, you remove
the core, you defeat Aslan.

178
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:25,083
You are correct.

179
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:26,833
Pretty sharp
for a one-eyed girl.

180
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:28,500
But there’s more to it
than that.

181
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:30,625
Before his death, Yuuki Riku
ordered part of

182
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:32,833
Suigin’s memories
be contained and sealed

183
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:35,125
in the talisman
you see before you.

184
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:39,125
Of course, that stupid
weird geezer did.

185
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:42,416
Just take my identity and stick
it inside of some blood freak!

186
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,750
I’m sure that it also holds
your origins.

187
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:46,416
If it simply contained
your memories

188
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,291
I think Yuuki would have
told you before he passed.

189
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:50,541
Uh-huh.

190
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:52,250
Yeah, maybe he did,
but without them,

191
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:55,333
I’ve been having a hard time
remembering things.

192
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:57,041
Sorry, Aslan.

193
00:09:57,125 --> 00:09:59,250
But it looks like I’m going to
have to ask for those back.

194
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:01,500
They sorta belong to me.

195
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:02,708
[FARIN]
Be careful.

196
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:05,291
Raven Scarf, I activate you.

197
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:07,083
Upon summoning this Tomb Item,

198
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:08,833
seven different gems appear,

199
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:11,333
and every one possesses
a unique ability.

200
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:13,583
They randomly shuffle
when activated.

201
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:16,166
I keep forgetting
which color does what.

202
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:19,041
So please, choose me a winner.

203
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:20,666
Huh?
This one.

204
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:21,916
The time has come.

205
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,750
Show me the equipment’s power.

206
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:26,708
If it was worth him
becoming a Tomb Item!

207
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:30,333
[PLAYER 9] You see that?
It was some kind of explosion!

208
00:10:30,416 --> 00:10:32,250
[PLAYER 10] A player must be
fighting the boss!

209
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:34,333
[PLAYER 11] Do they have
a death wish or something?

210
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:37,333
Can you tell
if Suigin’s all right?

211
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:40,500
It’s up to fate to decide
whether he’ll live or perish.

212
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:44,291
You’re more difficult to kill
than the rest.

213
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:47,541
Unleash armed skill.

214
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:49,375
The Raven Blade.

215
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:53,375
I can endlessly regenerate
any damage you deal my body.

216
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:56,625
What good do you think
a sword will serve you?

217
00:10:56,708 --> 00:10:59,333
Sorry to tell you, but this
is no ordinary sword.

218
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:01,500
[yelling]

219
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:03,333
In addition to its
razor-sharpness,

220
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:06,250
the Raven Blade allows me
to triple my speed.

221
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,375
Opponents don’t even
have time to react.

222
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:13,291
[yelling]

223
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:15,291
[splashing]

224
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:30,333
He’s going to use the blood
droplets to regenerate.

225
00:11:30,416 --> 00:11:32,625
Then, before he does,

226
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:35,625
Aslan, I want my memories!

227
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:36,916
[energy bursting, crackling]

228
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:52,166
[energy buzzing]

229
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:54,541
Not good.

230
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:56,083
This armor’s tougher
than I thought.

231
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:58,041
The blade isn’t enough
to pierce it.

232
00:12:03,125 --> 00:12:04,500
If I’m going to win this,

233
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:05,791
I gotta come up with a plan B.

234
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:06,875
And quick.

235
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:16,916
[evil laughter]

236
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,166
[ASLAN] You immobilized me
by damaging my limbs

237
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,041
so I couldn’t attack,

238
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:24,333
then attempted to finish me off
with a sword stab to the head.

239
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:26,750
You must not understand,
Suigin Riku.

240
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:28,875
As long as
I’m in the ocean of blood,

241
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:31,208
I remain invincible!

242
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:35,250
Stab, slash, hack away
as much as you wish!

243
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:37,875
I’ll heal and only become
stronger!

244
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:39,041
Interesting.

245
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:41,000
Not only does it
help you regenerate,

246
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:42,833
you can use players' blood
to gain limbs

247
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:44,666
and increase your body size.

248
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,333
Wait, does that mean that

249
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:52,416
Aslan is literally made
from our blood, sweat and tears?

250
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,666
Yes.

251
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,333
[ASLAN]
What’s the matter, Suigin?

252
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:57,583
Too petrified to make
the first move?

253
00:12:57,666 --> 00:12:59,416
Guess it’s up to me!

254
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:02,208
Seriously?

255
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:04,166
And he can shoot orbs of plasma?

256
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:08,250
[grunting]

257
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:13,166
[SUIGIN]
Not only did his size increase,

258
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,625
apparently, so did his power.

259
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:17,208
There’s no comparison.

260
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:19,375
He’s way stronger than I am.

261
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:21,416
Can I even win against him?

262
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,333
No.
I don’t stand a chance!

263
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:31,875
[attack yelling]

264
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:42,333
[evil laughter]

265
00:13:42,416 --> 00:13:44,791
Your precious sword
is out of commission!

266
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:47,000
[panting]

267
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:48,125
Think, Suigin.

268
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:49,416
At this point in the match

269
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,291
it’s too hard
to damage him directly.

270
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:54,666
I can hold on a while longer

271
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:57,250
if he doesn’t have any other
tricks up his sleeve.

272
00:13:58,291 --> 00:13:59,125
What the--?

273
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:01,250
Is that some kind of halo?

274
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:03,000
[ASLAN]
Think of it as a crown.

275
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:05,708
An emblem of those
selected by me.

276
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:08,875
This symbol is the mark
of my Snow Lotus.

277
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:10,791
The flower will gradually wilt

278
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:13,416
over the course
of the next 80 seconds.

279
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,916
During that time, I will gain
control of all the blood

280
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,583
flowing through your veins.

281
00:14:17,666 --> 00:14:21,250
Once the final petal has fallen,
the curse is completed.

282
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:24,916
The blood will burst forth
from your body and you will die.

283
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,583
Burst out of my body?

284
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:28,625
[ASLAN]
However,

285
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:30,541
despite the odds of success,

286
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:33,125
there’s one chance
to release you from the curse.

287
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:35,916
If you’re able to steal my core
in the next 80 seconds,

288
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,208
it’ll be lifted.

289
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:39,166
If you win, you’ll survive.

290
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:41,750
But if you lose,
your body will shatter,

291
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:43,583
the same as your sword.

292
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:45,041
-[shattering]
-[grunting]

293
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:49,166
In that case...

294
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:54,083
No problem.

295
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:56,500
That’s plenty of time for me.

296
00:14:56,583 --> 00:15:00,291
Eighty seconds is all I need
to cut you down to size, Aslan.

297
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:06,291
Why’s that smoke pouring
out of the sword?

298
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:07,541
A defensive move?

299
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:09,041
Whatever its purpose,

300
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:11,208
the cloud is engulfing
the players and the Stage.

301
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:13,416
It’s becoming obvious
the sword’s true power

302
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,708
isn’t for slashing.

303
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:16,458
Hey, what’s up
with the smokescreen?

304
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:17,833
Is it just me or do you feel

305
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:19,541
like you’re catching
a second wind, too?

306
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:20,791
So you’re a badass?

307
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:22,541
Then stop wasting
everyone’s time

308
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:24,916
and show us
your ultimate move, already.

309
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:25,958
[ASLAN]
I’ll oblige,

310
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:28,250
if you’re that eager to die.

311
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:29,333
What’s he thinking?

312
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:30,875
Doesn’t he realize if he loses,

313
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:33,208
the game permanently
removes his assets?

314
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:34,708
Seems confident.

315
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:36,416
Maybe he’s figured out
something we haven’t.

316
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:39,333
Like maybe some way to defeat
the boss and clear this stage!

317
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:40,750
Very well.

318
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:43,416
Since you desire
to embrace death, I summon.

319
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,125
Bloody Hell Crimson Dragon!

320
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:49,500
Upwards the serpent
rises to the heavens,

321
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:52,333
bringing about a storm
that will seal your doom!

322
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:56,125
The way that dragon’s flying,

323
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:59,000
swirling to the sky
in a spiral pattern.

324
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:02,125
Basically, operating
the same as a tornado.

325
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:04,291

I get to the center,

the calmer the storm!

to become a Tomb Guardian?

In a head-to-head fight

[ASLAN]
My body.

379
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,625
Why is it refusing
to regenerate?

380
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:33,333
Hey, I told you I wasn’t lying.

381
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:35,000
I knew I couldn’t beat you
head-on

382
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:37,291
after what you did to my blade.

383
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:39,833
But this weapon came from my
gramp's Raven Scarf.

384
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:41,250
So,

385
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:43,000
there had to be more to it
than meets the eye.

386
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:45,791
I didn’t realize what until
after you shattered it.

387
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:46,958
Wait.

388
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:48,416
Are you saying the smoke
it released

389
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,250
somehow gave you the upper hand?

390
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:51,791
That vapor isn’t smoke.

391
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:54,250
It's highly concentrated oxygen
that boosted Suigin

392
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:56,250
and the other players' stamina.

393
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:59,875
I figured out if the source
of Aslan’s power is blood,

394
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:03,583
then his body must be composed
almost entirely out of iron.

395
00:19:03,666 --> 00:19:04,791
I can’t say it wasn’t risky

396
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:06,666
injecting his body
full of oxygen

397
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:09,416
since it would increase
his power for a short while.

398
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:13,500
But eventually, it’d react with
the iron and make him rust.

399
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:15,000
Lucky for me,
when the blade broke,

400
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:17,416
it released even more
into the environment.

401
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,666
The sword itself must be
composed of oxygen

402
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:23,000
if it spread so quickly
and engulfed the battlefield.

403
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:24,458
Right.

404
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:27,250
My gramp’s Divine Tomb Weapon,
the Raven Blade.

405
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:28,750
I don’t believe you.

406
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:30,458
To reach the point
where I couldn’t regenerate,

407
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:33,125
every blood cell in me
would need to be affected.

408
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:34,666
A valid point.

409
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:37,166
Even with the hits Suigin
did manage to land on Aslan,

410
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:38,916
it still wouldn’t
have been enough.

411
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,291
I mean what other explanation
is there?

412
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:42,375
[ASLAN]
There is none!

413
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:43,791
It’s impossible!

414
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:45,083
Why?

415
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:47,000
[ASLAN] If his sword was
truly responsible,

416
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:50,333
I would have started rusting
as soon as I was damaged!

417
00:19:50,416 --> 00:19:52,750
And that clearly
wasn’t the case.

418
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:54,583
You’re keeping something
from me.

419
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:58,166
Some additional ability used
while I was distracted!

420
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:01,083
Nothing too remarkable,
I’m afraid.

421
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:03,291
As you said, I could only apply
minimal damage

422
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:04,750
with my sword strikes.

423
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:07,041
Most of the cuts
were superficial, anyway.

424
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:08,458
You could repeatedly
heal yourself

425
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,333
from any slash I inflicted.

426
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:12,750
And only your blood splatter
would turn to rust.

427
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:15,125
Then I remembered
something important.

428
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:16,416
You mentioned you regenerate

429
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,250
using the blood
you harvest from players.

430
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:21,416
So I created an oxygen field.

431
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:25,250
That way all the droplets would
be filled with the element.

432
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:28,041
The more you kept regenerating
to increase your strength,

433
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:29,791
the weaker
you actually became.

434
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:32,208
That doesn’t explain
why my body dissolved.

435
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:34,750
I should have still retained
my form.

436
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:36,750
Remember using
your plasma attack?

437
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:38,791
That’s what gave me the idea.

438
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:41,416
If I could convince you to use
a more powerful move,

439
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,833
then the whole field
would be covered

440
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:44,750
in an electromagnetic wave,

441
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:47,791
resulting in the oxygen
undergoing a chemical reaction.

442
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:50,375
Into ozone.

443
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:53,500
The blood inside of you
soon began breaking apart,

444
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:55,833
and your body followed suit.

445
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:57,291
So all that ozone?

446
00:20:57,375 --> 00:20:59,916
It resulted in a second
chemical reaction.

447
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,833
Which depleted your blood of
the necessary oxygen.

448
00:21:02,916 --> 00:21:05,458
You're talking about
oxygen poisoning.

449
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:08,250
Yep. That's the reason
your cells broke apart

450
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:10,000
and became only liquid.

451
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:13,250
It's gonna prove difficult for
you to regenerate for a while.

452
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:15,291
In the meantime,
could you give me a lesson

453
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:17,375
on how to use this thing?

454
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:20,291

receive your answer.
