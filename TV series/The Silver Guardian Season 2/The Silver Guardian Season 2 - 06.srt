165
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:17,458
[KITAKAZE] I’m more than enough
to deal with you.

166
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:19,958
You’ll have to get through me.

167
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:22,125
Some weakling from the Totems?

168
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:23,875
Not interested.

169
00:08:23,958 --> 00:08:26,500
Do you actually think you’re
worth even a second of my time?

170
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:29,250
You move as fast as you talk?

171
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:32,250
Well, if that’s more your speed,
why didn’t you say so?

172
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:33,500
[clanging]

173
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:36,291
[cackling]

174
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:39,125
Just as boring as I expected!

175
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:41,291
This freak show is
keeping pace with me.

176
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:42,500
[clanging]

177
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:47,250
Your dexterity is surprisingly
low, my friend.

178
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:51,416
And your strength
is basically zero.

179
00:08:56,291 --> 00:09:00,458
How do you expect to damage me
when you’re both slow and weak?

180
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:01,583
It increased.

181
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:02,916
For some reason his attacks

182
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,166
are causing
the number on my hand

183
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:05,958
to gradually rise in value.

184
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,375
I’ll look forward to you
actually doing

185
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:11,208
something interesting.

186
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:12,458
Armed move:

187
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:14,333
Tempest Punisher!

188
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:18,791
What a major shockwave!

189
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:23,750
He’s got an array
of destructive attacks,

190
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:26,291
and avoiding them is difficult.

191
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:27,833
[RANDENGYOKU]
Armed move:

192
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:31,083
Tempest Arrow!

193
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:32,500
-Dammit!
-[explosion]

194
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:33,708
[RANDENGYOKU]
Looks like my number

195
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:35,416
hasn’t gone up at all.

196
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,500
So whenever he makes contact
with something dealing with me,

197
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:39,916
like armor or a weapon,
the digits increase.

198
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,208
And when they reach
a certain point,

199
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:43,875
something bad probably happens.

200
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:47,041
I sincerely hope it wasn’t
that cheap of a trick.

201
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:49,791
But seeing how you’re not able
to even lay a finger on me,

202
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:52,958
I’m afraid it’ll just have to be
a mystery forever, won’t it?

203
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:05,125
[NISHIKAZE]
Beck, what are you doing here?

204
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:06,791
[BECK]
The boss gave the order for me

205
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:09,458
and Nondead to drop in
and rescue you sorry lot,

206
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:11,708
and it appears we arrived
in the nick of time.

207
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:13,625
Well, looks like we’ve got
an ice wizard

208
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:14,875
joining in the battle.

209
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:16,166
Pretty rare.

210
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,250
Shoukei, how about
breaking apart that wall

211
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:19,583
when you’ve got a minute?

212
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:23,291
[thudding]

213
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:25,083
Boss!

214
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,791
I don’t know what the hell’s
going on, but I can’t move!

215
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:29,541
[frustrated yelling]

216
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:36,541
At last, I can finally enjoy
a moment of peace and solitude.

217
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:38,125
I suggest you two settle down

218
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:41,375
and come enjoy a cup
of relaxing tea with me.

219
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:43,208
[SHOUKEI] Who are the hell
are you, anyway?

220
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:45,041
[NONDEAD]
Well, that won’t do at all.

221
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:49,291
[SHOUKEI] Someone get over here
and help untie me!

222
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:50,291
Well, well.

223
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:52,333
And we also have tree binding.

224
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:55,208
A variety of summoning magic
on display today.

225
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:56,875
We’re happy to show you more,

226
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:58,708
or you could be smart
and give up.

227
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:01,875
Me, give up?

228
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:03,875
Even among Precious’s
other elite members,

229
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:06,333
my abilities
are vastly superior.

230
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:11,750
My assets total at 999,999,999.

231
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:15,375
In other words, I’m a Billion
Player in all but name!

232
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:18,416
Are you positive you want
to allow this, Dark Tiger?

233
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:21,458
Not to speak out of turn, sir,
but remember, Randengyoku

234
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:24,166
did attempt to steal
your throne at one point.

235
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,208
[RANDENGYOKU]
What do you say?

236
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:26,833
Let’s have some fun!

237
00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:29,958
Strengthening move: Saiten!

238
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:31,375
You can’t be serious.

239
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:33,833
There goes the peace
and solitude out the door.

240
00:11:33,916 --> 00:11:34,916
What is this?

241
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,250
He’s more powerful than Aslan!

242
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:39,791
[RANDENGYOKU] If you’re really
the sixth Billion Player.

243
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:43,708
Let’s see if you’re as deserving
of the rank as I am!

244
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:46,208
If you’re really
the sixth Billion Player.

245
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:49,083
Let’s see if you’re as deserving
of the rank as I am!

246
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,208
[FARIN]
He grew.

247
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:58,791
[SUIGIN] The things on his back
are transforming!

248
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:00,291
[chuckling]

249
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:04,083
How much stronger can he get?

250
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:06,375
Armored move:

251
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:08,791
the Rikudou Rinne Cannon!

252
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:12,375
This puppy shoots 666 shots
in one minute.

253
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:15,083
In short, aiming’s not
really a priority.

254
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:16,916
Everyone, get behind me!

255

-[whirring]
-[shots firing]

256

[shattering]

257
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:30,000
Such an irrational display
of force!

258
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:33,208
My ice shield isn’t going to
hold for that much longer!

259
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:35,416
Hurry out of his range
and find shelter!

260
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,375
[SUIGIN]
There’s no safe place to run!

261
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:39,125
What do we do?

262
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:42,083
Oh, come on. At least
put up a struggle.

263
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:43,375
This is it.

264
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:45,375
I’m sorry, but I’ve
reached my limit.

265
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:50,083
[shattering]

266
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:51,625
Halo Skill!

267
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:53,416
Penta Sanc Wood!

268
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,250
Activate!

269
00:12:57,583 --> 00:12:59,666
Oh? So you’re trying
to soften the blow

270
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:02,416
by surrounding yourself
with Mother Nature, are you?

271
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,375
I give you a ten for effort,

272
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:07,250
but I wonder how long
it can withstand my barrage!

273
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:11,458
Hey!
We’re not dead!

274
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:13,375
If we wait here long enough,
do you think there’s a chance

275
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:15,333
he’ll eventually
run out of bullets?

276
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:17,875
No. The wall will not hold.

277
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:20,041
[NONDEAD]
But it did buy us a moment.

278
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:22,000
Hey! Mr. Billion Player!

279
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:24,333
If you got ideas,
now’s the time!

280
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:27,250
Before we act,
I need to know something.

281
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:28,791
Considering this guy’s assets,

282
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:30,166
wouldn’t he become
a Billion Player

283
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:32,416
if he defeated
one more grave beast?

284
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,333
I mean, what’s holding him back?

285
00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:36,750
What an incredibly
stupid question.

286
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:39,333
[BECK] I can provide
an answer, but first...

287
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:42,125
The name is Beck and it’s
a pleasure to meet you, Suigin.

288
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:43,250
You, too, Beck.

289
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:44,791
I appreciate it.

290
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:47,583
Once your assets near a billion,
they reach a cap.

291
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:50,500
From then, you’re unable
to accrue more.

292
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:53,041
It doesn’t matter how much you
strengthen your Buster Item,

293
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:54,625
or how many beasts you defeat,

294
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:57,625
your assets remain frozen
under a billion.

295
00:13:57,708 --> 00:13:59,916
In total, there are ten players
who are nearing

296
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,625
or are currently
at this critical point.

297
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:04,541
Every one of them
has the potential to ascend

298
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:07,250
to the Billion Player
status at any time.

299
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:10,291
And included among this
small group is Randengyoku,

300
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:12,500
one of Precious’s
senior members.

301
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:14,250
[clanging]

302
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:15,875
He reached his own
critical point

303
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:18,625
during the first year of
Grave Buster’s closed testing.

304
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:22,083
But despite everything he’s
tried, he can’t reach a billion.

305
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:24,041
In order to break past
the asset limit,

306
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:26,208
you have to earn
a lone star-grade title.

307
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:28,583
[SUIGIN]
I see.

308
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:30,958
Interesting.

309
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:33,291
Then I must have obtained
Lone Star at the same time

310
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:35,791
I received my Seabay
from Gramps.

311
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:41,791
Can someone trade titles
with another player?

312
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:43,416
Not that I know of.

313
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,416
A title is basically your
occupation within the game.

314
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:49,708
But Lone Star operates
by different rules.

315
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:51,416
Players typically receive
their titles

316
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,708
through a combination
of experience and performance.

317
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:56,666
In addition, you can achieve
rarer classes

318
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:59,333
by completing difficult
side quests.

319
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:02,500
In my case, I brewed over
ten-thousand healing potions,

320
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,625
Nondead’s title
is Element Master,

321
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:09,958

He had to master metal, wood,
water, fire and earth magic.

An extremely difficult feat.

324

There’s a list you may consult

how to earn a specific rank,

without any information.

-[cackling]
-{shell casings clanging]

328
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:31,250
I should have had the Lone
Star title long ago.

329
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:33,083
Today it’s mine!

330
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:36,708
One year later, Dark Tiger,

331
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:39,333
I’m getting tired
of the silent treatment.

332
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:41,125
Don’t you think it’s about time

333
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:43,708
you told me how to obtain
what I so rightfully deserve?

334
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:46,333
Even after I ended up

335
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:48,375
killing over a hundred
high-level players,

336
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:50,333
it didn’t make any difference.

337
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:51,791
So what?

338
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:53,875
Maybe I’ve been going about it
the wrong way.

339
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:56,416
Perhaps I should kill a Billion
Player with a Lone Star

340
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,041
and then I’ll take their title.

341
00:15:58,125 --> 00:15:59,958
Don’t try and grow a brain now.

342

You wouldn’t last
a single minute, monkey boy.

343
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:03,500
Listen, I just want to know

344
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,666
if there’s room
for advancement in this guild.

345
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:08,166
What do you say, boss?

346
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:10,375
Let’s pretend I somehow got
the opportunity

347
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:12,375
to challenge
one of the Billion Players.

348
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:14,958
You wouldn’t be cruel
and stop me, right?

349
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:17,416
[KITAKAZE]
Lone Star titles are unique.

350
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,041
No two are the same.

351
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:22,333
Furthermore, each has a
tremendous corresponding power.

352
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:25,666
Powers so influential, they can
break the rules of the game.

353
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:27,875
They can subvert
the game’s rules?

354
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:29,208
That makes sense.

355
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:31,833
Like how the Collector
can hold ten items.

I wonder.

What does Grave Guardian
let me do?

358

Huh?

359
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:38,375
Seems the enemy
has ceased his firing.

Who wants to take a peek
outside?

reckless out there!

Cannon needs recharging.

We gotta wait three minutes
for it to cool down.

Afterwards, it’ll be able to
shoot six times stronger!

what special abilities
are associated with your title?

What do you intend to do?

379
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,833
Our enemy is rather
unpredictable.

Hey, unpredictable,
I can manage.

381

I just need to see him
with my own two eyes.

What’s this noise?

On this occasion, it chose
the purple gem

which in turn allows me to
strengthen one part of my body.

and your stats
become visible to me.

422

Saturn takes this information
and then analyzes the data.

423
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,333
Sure, but you can’t save anyone
just by strengthening your eyes.

424
00:19:32,416 --> 00:19:34,041
Which means the jewel
must have enhanced

some additional aspect of you
that relates to movement.

was right at your feet:

That’s right.
