your assumption my kunai

168
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:36,791
might have carried
some additional effect.

169
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:38,083
Too cautious, though.

170
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:40,708
In the end it was merely
a physical attack.

[SHAA groans]

172

You have a familiar?

173
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:48,000
Crap, Titan, just how much money
did you sink into this game?

174
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:50,583
I’ve invested about
500,000 myself

175
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:53,083
but there’s no way
I could afford a familiar!

Wait.

177
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:55,625
I’m guessing you must have
defeated

some high-level monsters

Since you’re always working it

My family's rich,

into the game and protect you!

And afterwards we can team up!

have equipped?

Show me your Buster Item,

Nah.

It’s not a big deal, really,

My apologies, but I do hate
wasting my time!

Hey, you were the one
who told us

that we need
to defeat you

before we can pass
this starter course.

Well, Instructor Rin,
I intend to.

I guess I did say that,
didn’t I?

Fine, then.

Why don’t we conclude your
first lesson, Trainee Titan?

Whenever you’re ready.

That’s strange.

I seem to have misplaced
my textbook.

enter the tournament this year.

00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:42,541
Call me Farin.

492
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:43,916
So, Farin.

493
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,250
Why weren’t you fighting back?

494
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:48,250
Because of my Decoy Mirage.

495
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:50,666
It takes some time
to recharge after using it.

496
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:54,500
You wanna tell me why you went
out of your way to save me?

497
00:20:54,583 --> 00:20:56,666
I want you and I
to form a party.

498
00:20:56,750 --> 00:21:00,333
No offense, but you’re not
exactly my type, Suigin.

499
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:01,958
[chuckling]

500
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:03,041
[phone rings]

501
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:05,375
Hey, who’s the girl, Master?

502
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:06,416
[yells]

503
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,125
Twin Star, uh.

504
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:09,583
I’m a little busy.

505
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:11,500
[TWIN STAR] With what?
You cleared the stage.

506
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:14,166
Everything’s wrapped up
so there’s no reason to stay.

507
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:17,458
You don’t expect me to leave
her here with Titan.

508
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:20,541
You’re so chivalrous when it
comes to young ladies, Ma--

509
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:25,500
How about you and I reach
an agreement, Farin?

510
00:21:25,583 --> 00:21:27,416
If I’m able to defeat Titan
for you,

511
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,333
you come with me
and join my party.

512
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:31,916
You’re kidding.

513
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,208
Nope, we can pinky swear on it.

514
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:36,333
We have a deal?

515
00:21:36,416 --> 00:21:38,166
[explosion]

516
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:42,000
Time to finish this.

517
00:23:43,458 --> 00:23:46,583
The Silver Guardian!
