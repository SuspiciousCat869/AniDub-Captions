1
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:46,041
[PLAYER 1]
He’s incredible.

2
00:01:46,125 --> 00:01:48,125
That’s so odd.
I had no idea there would be

3
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:51,041
this many players
remaining in the stage.

4
00:01:51,125 --> 00:01:53,166
No way that guy isn’t loaded!

5
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:55,333
What do you think about
joining up with our party?

6
00:01:55,416 --> 00:01:57,916
Yo. I’m pretty certain
that he’s the guy.

7
00:02:00,041 --> 00:02:01,541
How annoying.

8
00:02:06,791 --> 00:02:08,166
You hear them?

9
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:10,166
Everyone can’t stop
talking about you, Suigin.

10
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,125
Let them gossip.

11
00:02:12,208 --> 00:02:15,500
The only thing I’m focused on
is restoring my sealed memories.

12
00:02:15,583 --> 00:02:16,833
Speaking of...

13
00:02:16,916 --> 00:02:18,166
Aslan.

14
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:20,083
What happens to you
once your core is taken?

15
00:02:20,166 --> 00:02:21,916
[ASLAN]
That doesn’t matter.

16
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,625
You won, I lost.

17
00:02:23,708 --> 00:02:26,041
My job as a guardian
has come to an end.

18
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:27,833
As for how to use the core,

19
00:02:27,916 --> 00:02:32,208
if you follow me to Stage Zero’s
entrance, all will become clear.

20
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:35,500
Before I go, there’s something
I’ve been meaning to ask you.

21
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:38,375
Why hasn’t another high-class
player shown up yet?

22
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:41,833
The only one who appeared
was Dark Tiger.

23
00:02:41,916 --> 00:02:45,416
But besides him, not a single
other major player participated.

24
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,166
Don’t you find
that a little strange?

25
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:50,416
The mantis stalks the cicada,

26
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,375
unaware the sparrow
is behind it.

27
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:55,833
This would be the perfect time
for someone to steal my trophy.

28
00:02:55,916 --> 00:02:57,083
Very impressive.

29
00:02:57,166 --> 00:02:58,916
I was wondering
when you’d notice.

30
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,708
[ASLAN]
You’re an observant one.

31
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:03,166
It’s not that higher-ranking
players aren’t on the stage,

32
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,250
it’s just that
you can’t see them.

33
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:07,166
For your sake, I’m glad
you didn’t spend

34
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:09,041
a minute longer defeating me.

35
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:12,625
Or the one lying helpless
in a pile, would have been you.

36
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:14,416
Meaning?

37
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,875
Whatever you’re trying to say
doesn’t make very much sense.

38
00:03:16,958 --> 00:03:20,166
Unless there’s some elite player
hiding elsewhere in the level.

39
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:23,166
[SUIGIN]
If my suspicions prove correct,

40
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:25,791
there’s only one place
they could be.

41
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:28,458
They’re in another part of the
level, busy killing each other.

42
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,250
My thoughts exactly.

43
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:32,458
The ten million class players
are logging off.

44
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:34,500
One right after another.

45
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:37,125
Wait.

46
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:39,125
So the only reason they came
here was to kill each other?

47
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:41,500
How come they weren’t
interested in Aslan?

48
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:43,500
Understand their motivation.

49
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:45,916
The strong have confidence
to spare.

50
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,750
In their minds, Aslan was
an enemy

51
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:49,750
they could defeat
any time they wanted.

52
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:51,625
[SUIGIN]
I see.

53
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:53,333
I bet they were busy
fighting each other

54
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:55,500
for a shot
at the stage’s boss.

55
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:57,750
It probably wouldn’t
have mattered who won.

56
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,833
I only know I was lucky to get
the chance to challenge you

57
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:02,708
before any of them got here.

58
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,541
Or was this a trap set up
by someone, Aslan?

59
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,875
There must be more
to this level.

60
00:04:11,958 --> 00:04:14,125
[ELDER BABOON]
You have no idea!

61
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,791
[PLAYER 2]
Where’d they come from?

62
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:17,583
[PLAYER 3]
Look at their masks.

63
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:19,500
[ASLAN]
As you’ve already deduced,

64
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:20,958
they’re far from lightweights.

65
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:22,333
Which meant I had to seek
you out

66
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:24,333
before they had a chance
to fight me.

67
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:27,375
If any of them had engaged me
in combat before you,

68
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:30,833
our meeting would have
most likely never transpired.

69
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:34,208
So, basically, every high-class
player on Stage 18

70
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:35,791
wants to get a piece of me.

71
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:37,375
Guess we’ll just have to cross
that bridge

72
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:39,166
after dealing with the core.

73
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:40,458
We must hurry!

74
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:41,750
Travel to Stage Zero!

75
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:43,791
Then my mission
will be complete.

76
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:46,083
[ELDER BABOON] Shut
whatever’s left of your mouth!

77
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,541
The hell kind of boss
are you anyway?

78
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:52,166
Letting this no-name loser
demolish you?

79
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,708
[SUIGIN]
And you are?

80
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:56,416
[ELDER BABOON] Address me as the
Elder Baboon of Inbei.

81
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:00,208
Hand over the core if you want
to avoid a gruesome death.

82
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:01,166
What?

83
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:02,458
Are you sure?

84
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:04,291
You certainly sound
like a person to me,

85
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:06,208
but, if you want
to be a monkey...

86
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:08,750
Also, where’s the rest of you?

87
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:12,291
[SILVERBACKS] When you insult
our leader, you insult us all!

88
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:14,000
Silverbacks unite!

89
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:15,583
This isn’t good.

Those are the infamous
gang of thugs, the Silverbacks.

Who’re you calling thugs?

92

We’re a reputable organization,
and don’t you forget it!

Let’s give ‘em a demonstration
of our three tenets!

94

Teamwork, strength,
and effectiveness!

00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
[SILVERBACKS]
Yeah!

96
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:35,791
I can definitely confirm whoever
they are, they’re not good guys.

97
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:38,041
And I’m going to have to ask you
to remove your foot.

98
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:39,750
Aslan can’t breathe with you--

[grunts]

100
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:42,958
[ELDER BABOON] You can have
that ridiculous mask

101
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:44,916
and wear it for all
I care, brat.

102
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,375
You think just because
you defeated him

103
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:48,416
you’re suddenly worth a damn?

104
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,708
When I tell you who I am,

105
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:52,291
you’ll crumble
under the prestige.

106
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:54,791
You should do yourself a favor
and grow a brain.

107
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:56,833
Bow while you still can.

You, on the other hand,
honey pie,

109
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,291
I’d recommend distancing
yourself from this newb

110
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:02,833
as soon as possible.

111
00:06:02,916 --> 00:06:04,625
You should join the Silverbacks.

112

since it’s about to run out.

162
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:44,208
You’ve never laid eyes
on one of these before?

163
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:45,666
Consider it an honor!

164
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,041
Only players with assets
of a million

165
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:49,250
or over can access
these graphs!

166
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:51,458
You mean the beam of light
represents his assets?

167
00:07:51,541 --> 00:07:52,916
That’s a real warrior!

168
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,708
[ELDER BABOON] Based on its
intimidating length,

169
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:56,791
you can clearly make out
my total assets

170
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:59,083
reach beyond
the five million mark!

171
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:00,416
That’s it?

172
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,125
I don't know if I’d go
bragging about it.

173
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:04,125
Don’t pretend like
you’ve seen bigger!

174
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:05,583
How about it, Silverbacks?

175
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:08,083
Should we show this dumbass
our Asset Graphs?

176
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:09,000
[SILVBACKS]
Yeah!

177
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:10,291
Silverbacks!

178
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:13,250
You can’t beat us,
so you best log out!

179
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:14,500
Silverbacks!

180
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:16,541
Retaliate against society!

181
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:18,291
[PLAYER 6]
Talk about legendary!

182
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:20,041
[PLAYER 7] They’ve all got a
million plus assets!

183
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:21,625
[PLAYER 8]
What a super squad!

184
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:23,916
I never thought they’d have
so many Million Players

185
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,208
in their party!

186
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:26,666
And they aren’t afraid
to show it off.

187
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:27,750
Huh?

188
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:29,083
You think ours are big?

189
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:31,625
Wait until you see
our leader’s assets!

190
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:34,583
His exceed well over
a hundred million!

191
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:37,541
[SUIGIN] If you like doing this
so much, mind if I try?

192
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:40,833
Oh, by the way, how do you use
an Asset Graph?

193
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:43,958
This scrub doesn’t even know
how to access the graph?

194
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:45,791
Do yourself a favor and hand
over the fruit

195
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:48,000
before you end up
hurting yourself!

196
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:51,500
Uh, Asset Graph, appear?

197
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:52,666
[energy shimmering]

198
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,000
What the hell?

199
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:55,250
[SILVERBACKS]
Elder, sir!

200
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:57,416
You ever seen anything that big?

201
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,916
[SUIGIN]
So, how’s it measure?

202
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,708
[SILVERBACKS]
It’s stupidly long!

203
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:05,958
Hundred thousand.
A million.

204
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:07,708
Ten million.
A hundred.

205
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:09,833
[PLAYER 9] Anyone still doubt
he’s a Billion Player!

206
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:11,958
[PLAYER 10] No wonder the dude
was able to completely

207
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:13,875
destroy the boss
like it was nothing at all!

208
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:16,708
You certain you want to take
the core from me now?

209
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:18,250
[FARIN]
All this time,

210
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:20,541
to think,
he was a Billion Player!

211
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:23,083
[ELDER BABOON] Stop acting
like this is some damn miracle!

212
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:26,000
I don’t know how the chief
is going to take this, though.

213
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:29,125
Not good.

214
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:30,375
[yelling]

215
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:35,833
[NISHIKAZE]
All right.

216
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:37,583
I know we’ve all been
having fun,

217
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:39,625
but it’s time to get serious.

218
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:41,458
Evil mirror, come to me.

219
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:45,750
Amazing.

220
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:48,041
[SUIGIN, FARIN yelling]

221
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:49,916
[yelling continues]

222
00:09:58,125 --> 00:09:59,666
[SUIGIN grunting]

223
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:02,291
[SUIGIN]
Talk about whiplash.

224
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:04,666
So this is the entrance
to Stage Zero.

225
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:07,583
We should be able to get in
with no problem,

226
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:09,791
thanks to the key
we got earlier.

227
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:11,833
You’re the only one
that can enter the stage.

228
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:14,625
The rest of us will have to wait
here until you return.

229
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:16,333
Is that a fact?

230
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:17,916
Whatever lies just beyond
the gate

231
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,166
was meant for your eyes
and your eyes alone, Suigin.

232
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:22,583
Got it.

233
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:24,166
I’ll see you guys
when I get back.

234
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:26,250
[ASLAN]
You aren’t going alone.

235
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:27,375
Hold up!

236
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:29,208
You mean you can fly?

237
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:37,083
All right.
Here it goes.

238
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:47,791
Some kind of white void,

239
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:49,625
without sound.

240
00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:03,333
What the... ?
Weird.

241
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:05,666
A feeling of nostalgia’s
washing over me.

242
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:10,625
[ASLAN]
It’s time, Suigin Riku.

243
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:12,458
Consume my core.

244
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:15,416
Your repressed memories
of this place will return,

245
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,958
and my mission
will reach its conclusion.

246
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:19,416
Well,

247
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,250
bottoms up.

248
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:25,541
What is this?

[laughing]

250
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:31,916
[YOUNG SUIGIN]
That’s weird.

251
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,666
The tree has a hole in it,
Gramps.

252
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:39,333
Yes, then the ceremony
is nearly finished.

253
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:41,208
[YOUNG SUIGIN]
What ceremony?

254
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:48,166
[crashing]

255
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,791
Damn it.

256
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:52,666
There goes my status symbol.

[phone ringing]

258
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:57,833
Who’s calling me
at a time like this?

259
00:11:57,916 --> 00:11:59,416
Yeah?
What is it?

260
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,791
I’m a little busy so whatever
the hell you need

261
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:02,291
just cut right to the chase.

262
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:03,375
[RANDENGYOKU]
It’s me, idiot.

263
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:05,708
Or don’t you recognize my voice?

264
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:07,875
Chief! Please forgive
my insubordination!

265
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:09,291
I’ve got all the time
in the world!

266
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:10,750
How can I help?

267
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:12,458
[RANDENGYOKU] I just
finished off this small fry.

268
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:14,833
But maybe you could shed
some light on a mystery.

269
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:17,791
Seems someone already defeated
the guardian boss.

270
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:20,958
So then, who’s stolen my
rightful victory away from me?

271
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:30,458
What am I seeing?

272
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:32,541
Are these my memories?

273
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:34,541
[YOUNG SUIGIN] Who's that
girl in there, Gramps?

274
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:36,458
[YUUKI]
Someone very special.

275
00:12:36,541 --> 00:12:39,416
The same extraordinary power
that flows through both of us

276
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,000
resides within
this child as well.

277
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:44,875
The poor girl’s parents
were murdered by him.

278
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:47,875
Despite his efforts, even
he cannot stop the ceremony.

279
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:50,708
Her powers will be offered
to this tomb.

280
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:54,333
The process is nearly
complete now.

281
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:56,625
The only step remaining
is for the tree

282
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:58,875
to entirely absorb her essence.

283
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:03,250
And in exchange, her power
will then defend this tomb.

284
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:07,125
Unfortunately, she must have no
recollection of her former life.

285
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:09,291
She’ll grow up to be
a normal girl.

286
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:13,041
Freed from the chaotic fate
she was once doomed to.

287
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,041
[YOUNG SUIGIN]
Hey, she fell down!

288
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:16,708
Suigin!

289
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:25,333
Hey.

290
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:27,166
Do you need some help?

291
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:31,375
Who are you, boy?

292
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:32,625
Oh, right.

293
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:34,458
My name is Suigin.

294
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:38,000
-Hi, Suigin.
-Hi!

295
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:39,833
What should I call you?

296
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:42,875
You have a name, right?

297
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:48,875
Huh? She fell asleep again.

298
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:52,541
Grandpa, why is it
that she can’t stay awake?

299
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:55,541
[YUUKI] Poor girl has lost
her strength from the ceremony.

300
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:57,541
Will she be okay?

301
00:13:57,625 --> 00:14:00,333
[YUUKI] There’s nothing
to worry about, Suigin.

302
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:03,333
Actually, it’s your turn next.

303
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:04,666
My turn?

304
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,500
[YUUKI]
I’m sorry I have to do this.

305
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:09,541
Understand, I must take
every precaution

306
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:11,333
to ensure the enemy
doesn’t find you.

307
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:12,416
[YOUNG SUIGIN]
Huh?

308
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,041
As of now,

309
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:16,541
you are no longer my grandson.

310
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:19,000
[screaming]

311
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:22,416
What... the... Aslan.

312
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:25,041
Did I really just
see my memories?

313
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:26,208
[ASLAN]
Correct.

314
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:27,833
He was convinced
it was the best way

315
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:29,708
to keep you safe from danger.

316
00:14:29,791 --> 00:14:31,958
He saved your memories
and information about

317
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:34,291
Stage Zero within that fruit.

318
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:36,125
Waiting until your return.

319
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:42,500
Powers residing deep
within this ancient blood,

320
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:44,708
hear me and heed my bidding.

Using this fruit,
protect the tomb from intruders.

322

Arise, be born
from a sea of blood.

327
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:08,791
Remember the following.

328
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:11,416
Those two precious children
are the single advantage

329
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,125
that we have
in this struggle.

330
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:16,125
I task you with
an important mission.

when the time comes.

332
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,250
[ASLAN]
Now do you see

333
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:23,000
who you really are?

334
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:24,000
Yeah.

335
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:25,666
I’m remembering everything.

336
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,208
[ASLAN]
Excellent.

337
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:30,041
Then my mission
has reached its conclusion.

338
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:31,291
Aslan.

339
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:33,708
[ASLAN]
I have one final gift for you.

340
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:35,250

A gift?

Are you seeing how many coins
we just won?

Looks like every player
that survived

346
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:51,500
the battle
is receiving prize money!

347

Lucky me!

00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:54,041
Glad I showed up!

[PLAYER 11] I never thought
I’d accumulate so many

Grave Buster is the best!

[FARIN] My Seabay
just got a notification.

353
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:02,666
Aslan was defeated!

354
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,541
Which means Suigin
should be coming back!

355
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:06,875
A little early for celebrating.

356
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:09,125
Finishing off the boss
in a stage too quickly

357
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:11,416
can sometimes
backfire on you.

What the hell’s going on?

Well, you see.

360
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:17,041
It turns out we’re kinda no
match for this player, boss.

361
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:18,416
Really.

362
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,541
I assume you didn’t fail
to mention my assets

363
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:22,333
or connections with Precious?

364
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:24,500
I don’t think that would have
changed anything.

He’s not like the others!

This one’s a Billion Player!

What?
Did you say a Billion Player?

369
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:33,958
Please don’t get emotional
until I can confirm it, boss!

Right!
Uh, his current location...

375
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:46,000
is on top of the temple
at the transfer entrance

[SILVERBACK 1]
Hey, Elder.

379
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:53,208
What do you think the boss
has got in mind for him?

380
00:16:53,291 --> 00:16:55,708
I don’t know, but man,
is he pissed off.

Speaking of "piss," BRB.

Like I ought to give a damn
if he’s a Billion Player or not.

How’s it too early to celebrate?

386
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:12,333
There are certain players
who don’t think highly of those

387
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:13,958
who defeat a boss
before them.

388
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:16,041
Case in point:

389
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:18,875
a powerful energy beam
is headed right for us.

None of the above, I’m afraid.

396
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:31,833
Looks to me like a super-long
range, wide-area sniper shot.

its power--is immeasurable!

It’s not often

use his god-killing shot!

403
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:48,458
Map Cannon’s his ultimate
special move

that he can only activate

[SUIGIN] Thanks, and that’s not
the only thing I left with.

A god-killing move had
zero effect on this dude.

But that’s impossible.

Are you sure you’re not hurt?

That wasn’t some minor attack
you should be able to brush off.

I’m fine, Farin, thanks to this
new equipment of mine.

And apparently,

428
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:47,375
having it fully loaded
also raises my HP.

429
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:50,625
When it goes into effect,
my health increases

430
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:52,583
until it’s equal
to the combined total

of every player
on the stage with me.

What’s still pretty
amazing, though?

That attack depleted it
by nearly a fifth.

Don’t get too cocky.

435

Most of the HP came from the one
who fired the shot.

All the players here
were simply pawns.

453
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:42,333
The entire point of the battle
was to use their numbers

454
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:44,958
to lower
their collective attack power,

455
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:46,583
making it far easier to wipe out

simultaneously.

480
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,541
Please believe me!

481
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:49,333
Afterwards, everything
will return to normal!

482
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:50,208
[REI]
I know.

483
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:52,125
I believe in you.

484
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:54,291
Do you remember how I waited
for you exactly like this

485
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:56,791
on the last day
of Dungeon Century?

486
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:59,333
I know you’ll save me,
same as before!

487
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:01,916
I’ll never let anything
like this happen to you again!

488
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:10,458
I swear that
I’ll protect you, Rei.

489
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:14,000
And find who’s responsible
for killing your father!

490
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:16,083
I’ll be waiting
right here for you.

491
00:21:17,041 --> 00:21:18,208
And look!

492
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:20,333
I’ve got upgraded equipment now.

493
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:22,583
Rei!
See you soon!

494
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:23,750
Suigin, wait!

495
00:21:23,833 --> 00:21:25,583
[SILICON]
That’s enough for now.

496
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:32,291
Stage Zero will officially open
in five days' time.

497
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:33,625
If all goes as planned,

498
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:36,791
I’ll hand you over
to Suigin Riku.

499
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:40,375
That is, if he manages
to stay alive until then.

500
00:23:44,125 --> 00:23:46,166
The Silver Guardian!
