If I can transport
all those bags,

00:16:57.517 --> 00:16:59.644 position:50% align:center
then you'll let me sketch
the sculpture when I'm done?

00:16:59.728 --> 00:17:01.730 position:50% align:center
[MASTER DANILO]
Certo.

00:17:01.813 --> 00:17:03.314 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
Very well, then.

00:17:04.607 --> 00:17:05.650 position:50% align:center
[gasping]

00:17:07.652 --> 00:17:08.653 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
Excuse me.

00:17:08.737 --> 00:17:09.779 position:50% align:center
[MASTER DANILO]
Uhh..

00:17:11.406 --> 00:17:13.241 position:50% align:center
[ARTE grunting]

00:17:22.334 --> 00:17:23.793 position:50% align:center
[sighs, grunts]

00:17:31.926 --> 00:17:34.346 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
It's no use! I can't lift it!

00:17:36.389 --> 00:17:37.474 position:50% align:center
[MASTER DANILO]
Hmph.

00:17:45.732 --> 00:17:47.233 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
I can't do it.

00:17:53.281 --> 00:17:56.451 position:50% align:center
[ARTE] That's right. Don't let
your arms do all the work.

00:17:59.287 --> 00:18:00.413 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:18:08.088 --> 00:18:11.007 position:50% align:center
[gasping]

00:18:25.563 --> 00:18:26.648 position:50% align:center
[MASTER DANILO]
Oh...

00:18:29.943 --> 00:18:32.237 position:50% align:center
'Ey! What're you
miserable lot looking at?

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:33.655 position:50% align:center
Get back to work!

00:18:35.573 --> 00:18:36.658 position:50% align:center
Idioti.

00:18:39.202 --> 00:18:42.539 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
It's heavy, but I won't give up.

00:18:46.042 --> 00:18:49.254 position:50% align:center
[ARTE] It's not impossible!
I can do this!

00:19:03.476 --> 00:19:04.602 position:50% align:center
One down!

00:19:21.786 --> 00:19:23.538 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
And--done.

00:19:25.373 --> 00:19:26.458 position:50% align:center
[ARTE giggles]

00:19:28.418 --> 00:19:30.837 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
That makes ten bags.

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:32.213 position:50% align:center
She did it.

00:19:32.297 --> 00:19:34.841 position:50% align:center
She managed to move
them all by herself.

00:19:34.924 --> 00:19:36.343 position:50% align:center
Okay then, a deal's a deal!

00:19:36.426 --> 00:19:38.094 position:50% align:center
So Master Danilo,
now that I've finished this,

00:19:38.178 --> 00:19:40.096 position:50% align:center
I can sketch the
sculpture, right?

00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:42.849 position:50% align:center
Eh, fine.

00:19:42.932 --> 00:19:44.809 position:50% align:center
I'm glad we could
work something out!

00:19:50.231 --> 00:19:51.274 position:50% align:center
[ANGELO]
Hmm?

00:19:54.235 --> 00:19:56.488 position:50% align:center
No, don't tell me...

00:19:56.571 --> 00:19:59.449 position:50% align:center
Her hand's're unsteady from
all the heavy lifting she did.

00:20:01.242 --> 00:20:07.374 position:50% align:center
Pfft! [laughs]

00:20:07.457 --> 00:20:10.001 position:50% align:center
I don't know if you're
amazing or just a fool.

00:20:10.085 --> 00:20:13.129 position:50% align:center
Don't make that face like
the world is ending, signorina.

00:20:13.213 --> 00:20:15.757 position:50% align:center
You may be a woman,
but you've got guts.

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:17.300 position:50% align:center
I'm impressed.

00:20:17.384 --> 00:20:20.387 position:50% align:center
I'll allow you to come back
another day after you've rested.

00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:24.516 position:50% align:center
[gasps, laughs]

00:20:24.599 --> 00:20:26.226 position:50% align:center
Thank you, Master Danilo!

00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:31.106 position:50% align:center
[ARTE] It was so nice of you
to walk with me, Angelo.

00:20:31.189 --> 00:20:32.774 position:50% align:center
Ciao!

00:20:32.857 --> 00:20:34.651 position:50% align:center
Wait! Arte.

00:20:34.734 --> 00:20:36.236 position:50% align:center
I was just thinking.

00:20:36.319 --> 00:20:38.947 position:50% align:center
Since Master Danilo has taken
a liking to you now,

00:20:39.030 --> 00:20:40.615 position:50% align:center
why don't you switch
shops and apprentice

00:20:40.699 --> 00:20:42.075 position:50% align:center
under him instead?

00:20:42.158 --> 00:20:45.578 position:50% align:center
And me. I could help you
with anything that you need.

00:20:45.662 --> 00:20:48.957 position:50% align:center
I'm sure everyone there would be
kind, and treat you like a lady.

00:20:50.917 --> 00:20:52.711 position:50% align:center
While I appreciate the offer,

00:20:52.794 --> 00:20:54.796 position:50% align:center
I like where I am,
so I'm going to continue

00:20:54.879 --> 00:20:56.423 position:50% align:center
apprenticing with Leo.

00:20:56.506 --> 00:20:58.925 position:50% align:center
[ANGELO]
HuH? But, the way he treats you!

00:21:01.553 --> 00:21:03.596 position:50% align:center
Leo may be strict,
but it's so I can grow

00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:07.308 position:50% align:center
into a better apprentice,
not because I'm a girl.

00:21:07.392 --> 00:21:10.478 position:50% align:center
I don't want
to be treated differently.

00:21:10.562 --> 00:21:13.106 position:50% align:center
I want to be challenged,
because that's what makes

00:21:13.189 --> 00:21:15.191 position:50% align:center
a job worth doing.

00:21:15.275 --> 00:21:17.110 position:50% align:center
Every time I
accomplish something,

00:21:17.193 --> 00:21:19.195 position:50% align:center
it feels like I've
grown as a person.

00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:22.949 position:50% align:center
I need that!
And I don't want to lose it!

00:21:34.586 --> 00:21:36.087 position:50% align:center
Hey, I'm home!

00:21:36.171 --> 00:21:37.630 position:50% align:center
Impeccable timing!

00:21:37.714 --> 00:21:41.217 position:50% align:center
The rocking horse is broken
again, Angelo! Fix it, please.

00:21:41.301 --> 00:21:42.260 position:50% align:center
[ANGELO'S YOUNGER SISTER 02A]
There's a nail sticking out

00:21:42.344 --> 00:21:43.803 position:50% align:center
that needs hammering in.

00:21:43.887 --> 00:21:44.679 position:50% align:center
[ANGELO'S OLDER SISTER 02A]
Do you mind carrying this bag

00:21:44.763 --> 00:21:46.097 position:50% align:center
of flour to the storeroom?

00:21:46.181 --> 00:21:47.307 position:50% align:center
[ANGELO'S OLDER SISTER 02B]
Shoulder massage.

00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:50.018 position:50% align:center
[sighs]
Everyone.

00:21:50.101 --> 00:21:52.812 position:50% align:center
I think you're all more capable
of this stuff than you think.

00:21:52.896 --> 00:21:54.814 position:50% align:center
[SISTERS]
Huh?

00:21:54.898 --> 00:21:56.358 position:50% align:center
[ANGELO] You might be surprised
how much you can do

00:21:56.441 --> 00:21:57.859 position:50% align:center
by your own hand.

00:22:03.406 --> 00:22:04.949 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
Good night, Master Leo!

00:22:09.162 --> 00:22:10.455 position:50% align:center
I'll clean them up!

00:22:20.674 --> 00:22:22.092 position:50% align:center
Let me help you with that.

00:22:22.175 --> 00:22:23.468 position:50% align:center
Or you'll be here all night.

00:22:23.551 --> 00:22:25.762 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
Really? Uh, grazie!

00:23:57.145 --> 00:23:58.563 position:50% align:center
[ARTE] What a surprise,
finding out there are

00:23:58.646 --> 00:24:00.648 position:50% align:center
other kind people
like you, Angelo.

00:24:00.732 --> 00:24:03.193 position:50% align:center
[ANGELO] If you're ever having
any trouble, I'm here to help!

00:24:03.276 --> 00:24:06.321 position:50% align:center
[ARTE] But I'm still going to do
the best I can on my own!

00:24:06.404 --> 00:24:08.198 position:50% align:center
Next time, "First Job."

00:24:08.281 --> 00:24:09.616 position:50% align:center
I have to finish it!
