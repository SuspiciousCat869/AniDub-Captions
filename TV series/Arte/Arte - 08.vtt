[LEO]
Come on. Where is it?

00:02:17.554 --> 00:02:20.181 position:50% align:center
[VERONICA] So, that's the
reason you're going to Venice?

00:02:20.265 --> 00:02:22.559 position:50% align:center
I'm having a hard time
believing it myself.

00:02:22.642 --> 00:02:23.852 position:50% align:center
When are you leaving?

00:02:23.935 --> 00:02:25.395 position:50% align:center
Actually, tomorrow.

00:02:25.478 --> 00:02:28.523 position:50% align:center
Tomorrow?
This is all so sudden.

00:02:28.606 --> 00:02:31.818 position:50% align:center
Though, I suppose it's not
out of character for you.

00:02:31.901 --> 00:02:33.820 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:02:33.903 --> 00:02:35.280 position:50% align:center
Be that as it may.

00:02:35.363 --> 00:02:38.825 position:50% align:center
I can't imagine
Florence without you.

00:02:38.908 --> 00:02:41.536 position:50% align:center
The city will feel so empty.

00:02:41.619 --> 00:02:44.039 position:50% align:center
What? Arte is leaving?

00:02:44.122 --> 00:02:45.290 position:50% align:center
[APPRENTICE 02D]
According to the rumor.

00:02:45.373 --> 00:02:46.833 position:50% align:center
That girl's something else.

00:02:46.916 --> 00:02:48.293 position:50% align:center
[APPRENTICE 02A]
It's a huge job!

00:02:48.376 --> 00:02:49.711 position:50% align:center
[APPRENTICE 02C]
But still, I can't help but be

00:02:49.794 --> 00:02:51.254 position:50% align:center
a little bit jealous.

00:02:51.338 --> 00:02:52.756 position:50% align:center
[APPRENTICE 02D]
She's an apprentice like us.

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:54.841 position:50% align:center
You should be cheering her on.

00:02:54.924 --> 00:02:56.176 position:50% align:center
[ANGELO grunts]

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:57.969 position:50% align:center
[APPRENTICE 02A]
Hey. Where're you going?

00:03:01.931 --> 00:03:03.683 position:50% align:center
[DARCIA]
You're traveling to Venice?

00:03:03.767 --> 00:03:05.643 position:50% align:center
[ARTE] Yes, but I don't
want your studies to stop

00:03:05.727 --> 00:03:07.520 position:50% align:center
just because I'm leaving.

00:03:07.604 --> 00:03:09.647 position:50% align:center
Here's a map to
Veronica's, if you go and ask

00:03:09.731 --> 00:03:12.317 position:50% align:center
to borrow books from her library
I'm sure she'll oblige!

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.320 position:50% align:center
Wait, by myself? Are you sure?

00:03:15.403 --> 00:03:17.030 position:50% align:center
[ANGELO]
Arte!

00:03:22.118 --> 00:03:25.246 position:50% align:center
[ANGELO] Thank goodness.
I found you in time.

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.582 position:50% align:center
What's the matter?

00:03:27.665 --> 00:03:29.209 position:50% align:center
When were you planning
on letting me know?

00:03:29.292 --> 00:03:31.670 position:50% align:center
The other apprentices had
to tell me that you're leaving!

00:03:31.753 --> 00:03:34.547 position:50% align:center
For how long? Am I ever
going to see you again?

00:03:34.631 --> 00:03:37.676 position:50% align:center
[DARCIA] Wha...?!
You are coming back, right?

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:40.387 position:50% align:center
Uh... Let me explain.

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.598 position:50% align:center
Look. I think there might be
a slight misunderstanding.

00:03:43.682 --> 00:03:46.601 position:50% align:center
I am going,
but it's only for six months.

00:03:46.685 --> 00:03:48.478 position:50% align:center
[ANGELO]
Huh? So just half a year?

00:03:48.561 --> 00:03:50.063 position:50% align:center
Oh, that's good.

00:03:50.146 --> 00:03:52.857 position:50% align:center
I was really convinced you were
going to stay there permanently.

00:03:52.941 --> 00:03:54.943 position:50% align:center
No! I'll be back in no time!

00:03:55.026 --> 00:03:58.154 position:50% align:center
What a relief.
You had me worried.

00:03:58.238 --> 00:04:00.657 position:50% align:center
And it seems I wasn't alone.

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:03.451 position:50% align:center
Is this man a friend
of yours, Arte?

00:04:03.535 --> 00:04:05.412 position:50% align:center
[ARTE] That's right.
You two haven't met yet.

00:04:05.495 --> 00:04:08.206 position:50% align:center
This is Angelo.
He's an apprentice, like me.

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:09.749 position:50% align:center
Meet Darcia.

00:04:09.833 --> 00:04:12.252 position:50% align:center
She's a friend of mine, and
an amazing seamstress as well!

00:04:12.335 --> 00:04:14.879 position:50% align:center
It's a pleasure to meet you!

00:04:14.963 --> 00:04:17.549 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry I was in such
a panic when I arrived.

00:04:17.632 --> 00:04:19.050 position:50% align:center
Some first impression, huh?

00:04:19.134 --> 00:04:21.011 position:50% align:center
[DARCIA whimpers]

00:04:21.094 --> 00:04:22.679 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:04:22.762 --> 00:04:24.597 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
Darcia? What's the matter?

00:04:24.681 --> 00:04:25.807 position:50% align:center
[ANGELO]
Uhh...

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:27.976 position:50% align:center
He touched my hand.

00:04:28.059 --> 00:04:30.228 position:50% align:center
Uh? Did I do something wrong?

00:04:36.985 --> 00:04:39.279 position:50% align:center
[ARTE grunts]
All right.

00:04:40.989 --> 00:04:42.490 position:50% align:center
If you've said your farewells,

00:04:42.574 --> 00:04:44.534 position:50% align:center
we really must
be going now, Arte.

00:04:44.617 --> 00:04:45.785 position:50% align:center
Right!

00:04:47.912 --> 00:04:49.456 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
And... Leo.

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:50.665 position:50% align:center
I'll see you again.

00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:52.959 position:50% align:center
In six months!

00:04:53.043 --> 00:04:54.336 position:50% align:center
Before you go.

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:55.837 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
Huh?

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.255 position:50% align:center
You realize there'll come
a time when you have to leave

00:04:57.339 --> 00:04:59.424 position:50% align:center
this workshop to
venture out on your own

00:04:59.507 --> 00:05:01.176 position:50% align:center
and put your skills to use.

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:03.219 position:50% align:center
That is, if you want to
make a proper living and

00:05:03.303 --> 00:05:04.596 position:50% align:center
put food on the table.

00:05:04.679 --> 00:05:05.680 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
Huh?

00:05:05.764 --> 00:05:07.932 position:50% align:center
View this trip
as an opportunity, Arte.

00:05:08.016 --> 00:05:10.435 position:50% align:center
While you're there,
think carefully about

00:05:10.518 --> 00:05:12.103 position:50% align:center
everything I've said.

00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:16.107 position:50% align:center
[LEO] And afterwards,
when six months is up

00:05:16.191 --> 00:05:18.526 position:50% align:center
and you finish your job.

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:20.487 position:50% align:center
You don't have to return
if you don't want to.

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:22.113 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:05:22.197 --> 00:05:24.532 position:50% align:center
What? But I, uh...

00:05:24.616 --> 00:05:26.993 position:50% align:center
Forgive me. We need to depart.

00:05:27.077 --> 00:05:29.037 position:50% align:center
If you'd please step inside.

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.205 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
Uh...

00:05:34.042 --> 00:05:36.503 position:50% align:center
[LEO]
Lord Falier.

00:05:36.586 --> 00:05:38.338 position:50% align:center
Take care of my apprentice.

00:05:42.133 --> 00:05:43.885 position:50% align:center
I promise you, I will.

00:05:52.686 --> 00:05:55.980 position:50% align:center
Arte, here, this is for you.

00:05:56.064 --> 00:05:57.816 position:50% align:center
Leo told me to give it to you.

00:05:59.442 --> 00:06:02.195 position:50% align:center
A portable altarpiece
to take on your journey.

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:09.202 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
This is Leo's work.

--[pig snorting]
--[LEO] Hmm?

00:06:13.623 --> 00:06:16.042 position:50% align:center
[snorting continues]

00:06:16.126 --> 00:06:17.210 position:50% align:center
[LEO]
What do you think I am?

00:06:17.293 --> 00:06:18.545 position:50% align:center
Your dinner?

00:06:31.558 --> 00:06:33.601 position:50% align:center
Certainly is quiet now.

00:06:40.442 --> 00:06:42.694 position:50% align:center
[YURI] Thank you for letting
us rest here, sister.

00:06:50.118 --> 00:06:52.787 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
What Leo said earlier.

00:06:52.871 --> 00:06:54.456 position:50% align:center
I wonder what he meant.

00:06:56.416 --> 00:06:58.376 position:50% align:center
When these six months are over.

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:00.170 position:50% align:center
You don't have to come back.

00:07:01.546 --> 00:07:03.089 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
Huh? I want to.

00:07:03.173 --> 00:07:04.132 position:50% align:center
Wait, Leo!

00:07:04.215 --> 00:07:05.467 position:50% align:center
Don't go!

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:07.886 position:50% align:center
I'm coming back!

00:07:07.969 --> 00:07:09.095 position:50% align:center
[ARTE gasps]

00:07:09.179 --> 00:07:11.139 position:50% align:center
Finally, we've made it.

00:07:13.058 --> 00:07:14.351 position:50% align:center
[YURI]
Come along, Arte.

00:07:18.188 --> 00:07:19.856 position:50% align:center
[YURI]
Our vessel awaits.

00:07:28.198 --> 00:07:31.326 position:50% align:center
The winds should be favorable,
unlike our last voyage, sir.

00:07:31.409 --> 00:07:33.536 position:50% align:center
Most fortunate indeed.

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:35.663 position:50% align:center
[ARTE whimpering]

00:07:41.544 --> 00:07:43.755 position:50% align:center
[YURI chuckles]
Having a hard time balancing?

00:07:43.838 --> 00:07:46.007 position:50% align:center
I don't see what's
so amusing about it.

00:07:46.091 --> 00:07:47.801 position:50% align:center
And how do all of you
walk on this ship?

00:07:47.884 --> 00:07:49.844 position:50% align:center
It's constantly
swaying back and forth!

00:07:49.928 --> 00:07:51.971 position:50% align:center
Men of the sea like us
learn to ride the waves

00:07:52.055 --> 00:07:53.765 position:50% align:center
from birth, that's how!

00:07:53.848 --> 00:07:54.974 position:50% align:center
No matter the ship,

00:07:55.058 --> 00:07:56.476 position:50% align:center
without an able-bodied
crew running things,

00:07:56.559 --> 00:07:58.061 position:50% align:center
it'd never leave port.

00:07:58.144 --> 00:08:00.855 position:50% align:center
Once you set foot on deck,
we're the only thing standing

00:08:00.939 --> 00:08:02.440 position:50% align:center
between you and the sharks!

00:08:02.524 --> 00:08:03.900 position:50% align:center
[SAILOR 08B]
Besides, if pirates attack,

00:08:03.983 --> 00:08:06.736 position:50% align:center
we'd be pretty useless if we
couldn't keep our footing.

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:08.029 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
I'm sorry, pirates?

00:08:08.113 --> 00:08:10.448 position:50% align:center
[SAILOR 08A] We should
be fine in these waters.

00:08:10.532 --> 00:08:12.617 position:50% align:center
But if we did run into them,
it's not like they would

00:08:12.701 --> 00:08:14.327 position:50% align:center
stand a chance.

00:08:14.411 --> 00:08:15.995 position:50% align:center
Speaking of which, Lord Yuri,

00:08:16.079 --> 00:08:17.831 position:50% align:center
you haven't been
on board in a while.

00:08:17.914 --> 00:08:19.624 position:50% align:center
Yes. And what of it?

00:08:21.084 --> 00:08:23.795 position:50% align:center
I'd surmise your
swordplay's gotten rusty.

00:08:23.878 --> 00:08:25.213 position:50% align:center
How 'bout it?

00:08:25.296 --> 00:08:27.799 position:50% align:center
Care for a friendly match
to try and prove me wrong?

00:08:27.882 --> 00:08:29.009 position:50% align:center
[SAILOR 08B]
There's an idea!

00:08:29.092 --> 00:08:30.385 position:50% align:center
[SAILOR 08C]
This I've gotta see!

--Seems I've no choice.
--[ARTE] Huh?

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:34.472 position:50% align:center
Besides, I could use
a bout to limber me up

00:08:34.556 --> 00:08:37.350 position:50% align:center
after all that time spent
riding in the carriage.

[ARTE]
Amazing.

00:08:53.074 --> 00:08:54.617 position:50% align:center
Even though we're on a boat,

00:08:54.701 --> 00:08:57.370 position:50% align:center
they're fighting as if they
were on steady ground!

00:08:58.038 --> 00:09:00.498 position:50% align:center
Not the swordsman
you once were, Lord Yuri!

00:09:00.582 --> 00:09:03.710 position:50% align:center
Better luck next time.
Today's match belongs to me!

00:09:03.793 --> 00:09:05.086 position:50% align:center
[YURI]
That so?

00:09:07.297 --> 00:09:09.049 position:50% align:center
[YURI]
I wouldn't bet on it!

00:09:14.387 --> 00:09:16.139 position:50% align:center
This victory is mine.

Typical Lord Yuri!

00:09:21.644 --> 00:09:24.898 position:50% align:center
[growls] And here I thought
I was fighting a man of honor.

What kind of fiend
cheats in order to win

00:09:26.733 --> 00:09:28.485 position:50% align:center
a sparring match anyway?

00:09:28.568 --> 00:09:30.236 position:50% align:center
Tell me, after you're
stabbed by an enemy

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:34.074 position:50% align:center
in a real battle, will you make
the same excuses in Heaven?

00:09:34.157 --> 00:09:36.284 position:50% align:center
What's disgraceful
is the way you're acting.

00:09:36.368 --> 00:09:38.787 position:50% align:center
Show some dignity
and accept your loss already.

[SAILOR 08A growls]

00:09:50.465 --> 00:09:52.050 position:50% align:center
[ARTE] I wonder if Leo
was trying to tell me

00:09:52.133 --> 00:09:54.678 position:50% align:center
I'm in his way.

00:09:54.761 --> 00:09:57.055 position:50% align:center

No complaints here!

00:17:39.142 --> 00:17:41.519 position:50% align:center
However, this garment's
so finely tailored.

I feel like it's wasted on me.

00:17:44.022 --> 00:17:45.940 position:50% align:center
Such excellent lacework.

[YURI] I'm glad we live
up to our reputation.

By the looks of it,
I suppose you're my successor?

Allow me to give you
some parting advice.

00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:18.348 position:50% align:center
That girl is impossible
to manage,

00:18:18.431 --> 00:18:20.100 position:50% align:center
so there's no use in trying.

I guess I should
get started immediately.

You'll have to forgive her.

00:20:50.625 --> 00:20:53.211 position:50% align:center
I'm afraid my daughter
suffers from severe shyness,

00:20:53.294 --> 00:20:55.755 position:50% align:center
and even simple introductions
such as these often

00:20:55.839 --> 00:20:57.424 position:50% align:center
prove difficult for her.

00:20:57.507 --> 00:20:58.758 position:50% align:center
Which reminds me...

00:20:58.842 --> 00:21:01.052 position:50% align:center
Considering that you were
raised in a noble home,

00:21:01.136 --> 00:21:04.139 position:50% align:center
do you think you could teach her
etiquette lessons as well?

Yes! I'd be delighted to.

to have lots of fun.
How's that sound to you?

00:21:23.658 --> 00:21:26.161 position:50% align:center
You're a noble, but you
also work for a workshop

00:21:26.244 --> 00:21:27.871 position:50% align:center
as an apprentice?

00:21:27.954 --> 00:21:30.457 position:50% align:center
Yes! It's a bit
strange, isn't it?

No. You're what's strange.

You're not fooling anyone.

I mean, who carries their own
luggage up to the fourth floor?

How undignified.

00:21:41.134 --> 00:21:43.178 position:50% align:center
They kept saying
you were from nobility.

00:21:43.261 --> 00:21:44.804 position:50% align:center
I find that absurd.

carry luggage, are you?
