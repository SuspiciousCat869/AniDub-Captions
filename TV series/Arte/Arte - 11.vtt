[KATARINA]
Ahh...

00:00:57.349 --> 00:01:01.686 position:50% align:center
[laughs] You kept sleeping
through your lessons with Arte,

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.064 position:50% align:center
but now that she's
preoccupied, you miss her.

00:01:04.147 --> 00:01:07.150 position:50% align:center
[KATARINA growls] Seems like the
only thing she does these days

00:01:07.233 --> 00:01:08.818 position:50% align:center
is work on Mother's portrait.

00:01:08.902 --> 00:01:10.403 position:50% align:center
That's one of
the primary reasons

00:01:10.487 --> 00:01:12.864 position:50% align:center
she traveled here to Venice.

00:01:12.947 --> 00:01:15.367 position:50% align:center
You've also commissioned her
for a painting haven't you?

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.701 position:50% align:center
So you'll have
plenty of time to talk

00:01:16.785 --> 00:01:18.036 position:50% align:center
while you're modeling for it.

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.412 position:50% align:center
Yes, I suppose.

00:01:19.496 --> 00:01:22.707 position:50% align:center
It'll be nothing compared
to before, though.

00:01:22.791 --> 00:01:26.211 position:50% align:center
And besides, once the portraits
are done, she's going back home.

00:01:26.294 --> 00:01:27.587 position:50% align:center
Isn't she?

00:03:03.933 --> 00:03:06.478 position:50% align:center
You're coming with me to
the workshop, Katarina?

00:03:06.561 --> 00:03:08.104 position:50% align:center
Are you sure you want to?

00:03:08.188 --> 00:03:10.899 position:50% align:center
Yes. Uncle Yuri said it
was all right for me to go.

00:03:10.982 --> 00:03:13.818 position:50% align:center
He said I might find
the visit educational.

00:03:13.902 --> 00:03:16.613 position:50% align:center
[ARTE] I wonder what
he had in mind exactly.

00:03:16.696 --> 00:03:19.783 position:50% align:center
Well? Let's go, Arte!

00:03:19.866 --> 00:03:23.119 position:50% align:center
Uh. Sure. Why not?

00:03:29.751 --> 00:03:31.211 position:50% align:center
[KATARINA gasps]

00:03:34.047 --> 00:03:36.007 position:50% align:center
Hello, sir,
do you mind me asking

00:03:36.091 --> 00:03:37.509 position:50% align:center
what you're doing over here?

00:03:37.592 --> 00:03:40.804 position:50% align:center
[gasps] I-I've been assigned
to mix all the paint.

00:03:40.887 --> 00:03:43.223 position:50% align:center
Interesting. Is it for you?

00:03:43.306 --> 00:03:47.852 position:50% align:center
No, not yet. At the moment,
I'm still a lowly apprentice.

00:03:47.936 --> 00:03:50.397 position:50% align:center
[APPRENTICE 11A] What's with all
the girls in the workshop today?

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:51.940 position:50% align:center
[APPRENTICE 11B] I heard
the Falier family is here

00:03:52.023 --> 00:03:53.650 position:50% align:center
to tour the place.

00:03:53.733 --> 00:03:55.902 position:50% align:center
[APPRENTICE 11C] That must
be their daughter, Katarina.

00:03:55.985 --> 00:03:59.906 position:50% align:center
[APPRENTICE 11D] Wait, her
mother's the famous Lady Sofia?

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:01.408 position:50% align:center
[APPRENTICE 11B]
Oh, wow.

00:04:02.826 --> 00:04:04.452 position:50% align:center
[ARTE gasps]

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.750 position:50% align:center
Unreal. This panel's enormous.

00:04:10.834 --> 00:04:12.711 position:50% align:center
As soon as it's completed,
it'll be placed in

00:04:12.794 --> 00:04:15.296 position:50% align:center
the grand hall of the mansion.

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.674 position:50% align:center
The master's instructed
me to be your guide.

00:04:17.757 --> 00:04:20.218 position:50% align:center
I'll be happy to show you
around the workshop.

00:04:20.301 --> 00:04:22.262 position:50% align:center
Please, call me Matei.

00:04:22.345 --> 00:04:24.014 position:50% align:center
Must be frustrating
having to take time

00:04:24.097 --> 00:04:26.224 position:50% align:center
out of your busy
schedule for visitors.

00:04:26.307 --> 00:04:29.102 position:50% align:center
No, please.
I should be the one apologizing.

00:04:29.185 --> 00:04:30.895 position:50% align:center
[MASTER 11A]
Do you even want to be here?

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:34.107 position:50% align:center
Paint with passion!
Otherwise, there's the door!

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:37.235 position:50% align:center
As you can see, the Master
is currently preoccupied.

00:04:37.318 --> 00:04:40.905 position:50% align:center
So I'm afraid you're stuck with
a simple apprentice instead.

00:04:42.323 --> 00:04:44.868 position:50% align:center
Uh. Excuse me, Matei.

00:04:44.951 --> 00:04:47.203 position:50% align:center
[MATEI]
Hmm?

00:04:47.287 --> 00:04:49.622 position:50% align:center
I couldn't help but notice
you weren't surprised

00:04:49.706 --> 00:04:51.416 position:50% align:center
that I'm a female painter.

00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:54.878 position:50% align:center
Huh? I suppose at first I
thought it was unusual,

00:04:54.961 --> 00:04:57.881 position:50% align:center
but certainly not impossible
that there were people like you.

00:04:57.964 --> 00:05:00.925 position:50% align:center
You and I are both studying
to become painters.

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:04.220 position:50% align:center
No reason to treat you as
anything less than an equal.

00:05:04.304 --> 00:05:05.388 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:05:05.472 --> 00:05:06.723 position:50% align:center
[MATEI] Honestly,
what shocked me the most

00:05:06.806 --> 00:05:08.516 position:50% align:center
was that the daughter
of the Falier family

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.810 position:50% align:center
was accompanying you.

00:05:10.894 --> 00:05:12.979 position:50% align:center
I don't believe we've ever
had this many young women

00:05:13.063 --> 00:05:14.522 position:50% align:center
in our workshop before.

00:05:14.606 --> 00:05:17.192 position:50% align:center
Apologies. She wanted
to come along, too,

00:05:17.275 --> 00:05:19.778 position:50% align:center
and as her tutor,
I couldn't say no.

00:05:19.861 --> 00:05:23.323 position:50% align:center
You're a tutor for the Faliers?

00:05:23.406 --> 00:05:25.241 position:50% align:center
To achieve such
a respectable position,

00:05:25.325 --> 00:05:27.911 position:50% align:center
you must come from
a noble background as well.

00:05:27.994 --> 00:05:32.415 position:50% align:center
Yes. I was born into nobility,
but nothing like their family.

00:05:32.499 --> 00:05:36.211 position:50% align:center
Though, I suppose it helped me
get the job in the first place.

00:05:36.294 --> 00:05:39.339 position:50% align:center
I came here from Florence
as a portrait painter.

00:05:39.422 --> 00:05:42.592 position:50% align:center
Then you also have the benefit
of being well-educated?

00:05:42.676 --> 00:05:44.010 position:50% align:center
That's amazing.

00:05:44.094 --> 00:05:46.096 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't go that far.

00:05:46.179 --> 00:05:48.181 position:50% align:center
[MATEI]
I think it's fantastic.

00:05:48.264 --> 00:05:51.184 position:50% align:center
Better than toiling away in
a workshop for years like me,

00:05:51.267 --> 00:05:54.187 position:50% align:center
and not being able to
get anyone's attention.

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:57.482 position:50% align:center
For most apprentices,
that's their lot in life.

00:05:57.565 --> 00:05:59.067 position:50% align:center
[KATARINA]
Huh...?

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:01.695 position:50% align:center
[MATEI] Whereas you're from a
noble family, have an education,

00:06:01.778 --> 00:06:03.988 position:50% align:center
and also happen to be one of
the only female painters

00:06:04.072 --> 00:06:07.325 position:50% align:center
in the world.
It must be wonderful.

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:09.327 position:50% align:center
I'm envious of you.

00:06:09.411 --> 00:06:11.538 position:50% align:center
[ARTE gasps]

00:06:11.621 --> 00:06:13.373 position:50% align:center
[MATEI]
Is something wrong?

00:06:13.456 --> 00:06:16.543 position:50% align:center
Uh. [laughs]

00:06:22.882 --> 00:06:24.968 position:50% align:center
We've reached a good
stopping point for today.

00:06:25.051 --> 00:06:27.303 position:50% align:center
You're free to move
around now, Katarina.

00:06:27.387 --> 00:06:30.140 position:50% align:center
Ahh! I was about
to need a break!

00:06:30.223 --> 00:06:32.767 position:50% align:center
My shoulders have knots in them!

00:06:32.851 --> 00:06:34.936 position:50% align:center
Hey! So, now that
we're all done,

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:37.188 position:50% align:center
there's a recipe
I want to show you.

00:06:37.272 --> 00:06:39.149 position:50% align:center
Oh. I really want to try it.

00:06:39.232 --> 00:06:42.402 position:50% align:center
The only thing is, I should
probably get some studying in.

00:06:42.485 --> 00:06:46.239 position:50% align:center
[KATARINA] Ah. But after
every painting session,

00:06:46.322 --> 00:06:49.075 position:50% align:center
we always chat.
I was looking forward to it.

00:06:49.159 --> 00:06:51.619 position:50% align:center
And I promise, I'll make it up
to you just as soon as I have

00:06:51.703 --> 00:06:53.288 position:50% align:center
more time, okay?

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:56.249 position:50% align:center
I didn't know it
was such a burden.

00:06:56.332 --> 00:06:57.459 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
Bye!

00:07:06.176 --> 00:07:08.261 position:50% align:center
[KATARINA]
Is Arte not joining us?

00:07:08.345 --> 00:07:10.638 position:50% align:center
Apparently, she hasn't finished
all of her work for the day

00:07:10.722 --> 00:07:13.767 position:50% align:center
and she'll unfortunately be
absent this evening.

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:26.363 position:50% align:center
She's been working
all day, hasn't she?

00:07:26.446 --> 00:07:29.324 position:50% align:center
Yes. She said it's hard
for her to break away.

00:07:29.407 --> 00:07:30.909 position:50% align:center
What about tomorrow?

00:07:30.992 --> 00:07:33.870 position:50% align:center
I believe she's stopping by
the church to sketch.

00:07:33.953 --> 00:07:38.124 position:50% align:center
Again? It feels like, lately,
I never see Arte anymore.

00:07:38.208 --> 00:07:39.542 position:50% align:center
Ever since...

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:45.507 position:50% align:center
[KATARINA] Something changed
when we went to that workshop.

00:07:51.096 --> 00:07:53.181 position:50% align:center
[DAPHNE] Arte, are you
going out for something?

00:07:53.264 --> 00:07:55.892 position:50% align:center
Yeah, just some
drawing at the church.

00:07:55.975 --> 00:07:57.435 position:50% align:center
Are you feeling all right?

00:07:57.519 --> 00:07:59.688 position:50% align:center
I don't mean to pry, but I
couldn't help noticing light

00:07:59.771 --> 00:08:01.940 position:50% align:center
coming from your room
late in the evening.

00:08:02.023 --> 00:08:03.358 position:50% align:center
Is there something
that's keeping you

00:08:03.441 --> 00:08:04.526 position:50% align:center
from sleeping perhaps?

00:08:04.609 --> 00:08:06.277 position:50% align:center
Everything's fine, really!

00:08:06.361 --> 00:08:08.029 position:50% align:center
I'll see you later!

00:08:11.408 --> 00:08:12.367 position:50% align:center
[DAPHNE gasps]

00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:13.702 position:50% align:center
[KATARINA]
Daphne!

00:08:17.914 --> 00:08:20.208 position:50% align:center
[KATARINA] Arte's been
acting strange lately.

00:08:20.291 --> 00:08:22.919 position:50% align:center
She's been keeping herself so
busy that she doesn't even have

00:08:23.003 --> 00:08:24.838 position:50% align:center
time to talk like we used to.

00:08:24.921 --> 00:08:27.674 position:50% align:center
I admit, it's been
bothering me, as well.

00:08:27.757 --> 00:08:31.302 position:50% align:center
It's as if she views all other
activities as a waste of time,

00:08:31.386 --> 00:08:33.763 position:50% align:center
even eating.
She barely touches her meals.

00:08:33.847 --> 00:08:35.890 position:50% align:center
I'm also led to believe
she's studying art

00:08:35.974 --> 00:08:37.308 position:50% align:center
late into the night.

00:08:37.392 --> 00:08:39.811 position:50% align:center
I know she's always taken
her profession seriously,

00:08:39.894 --> 00:08:43.189 position:50% align:center
but recently, it feels like
she's pushing herself too hard.

00:08:44.733 --> 00:08:46.151 position:50% align:center
[KATARINA groans]

00:09:00.331 --> 00:09:02.083 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Can't fall asleep!

00:09:02.167 --> 00:09:03.585 position:50% align:center
I need to study.

00:09:03.668 --> 00:09:06.004 position:50% align:center
[MATEI] For most apprentices,
that's their lot in life.

00:09:06.087 --> 00:09:08.506 position:50% align:center
Better than toiling away in a
workshop for years like me,

00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:11.217 position:50% align:center
and not being able to
get anyone's attention.

00:09:11.301 --> 00:09:13.470 position:50% align:center
I'm envious of you.

00:09:13.553 --> 00:09:15.847 position:50% align:center
[ARTE] I'm sure he didn't
say that out of spite.

00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:19.267 position:50% align:center
He's probably just
frustrated with being stuck.

00:09:19.351 --> 00:09:22.062 position:50% align:center
But when I heard his words,
the only thing I could do

00:09:22.145 --> 00:09:24.230 position:50% align:center
was laugh like a fool.

00:09:24.314 --> 00:09:25.899 position:50% align:center
It's true, I've gotten
work because of

00:09:25.982 --> 00:09:30.904 position:50% align:center
my background and gender, but
it feels strange to hear that.

00:09:30.987 --> 00:09:33.990 position:50% align:center
This entire time, everyone told
me how I'd never be an artist

00:09:34.074 --> 00:09:35.950 position:50% align:center
for those two reasons.

00:09:36.034 --> 00:09:37.869 position:50% align:center
Adversity became routine.

00:09:37.952 --> 00:09:41.873 position:50% align:center
I had to stay strong,
and keep looking forward.

00:09:41.956 --> 00:09:43.917 position:50% align:center
Until now.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.795 position:50% align:center
Suddenly, I'm told
the complete opposite.

00:09:46.878 --> 00:09:49.714 position:50% align:center
It felt like a rejection of
all the effort I put in.

00:09:54.678 --> 00:09:56.763 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
I couldn't sit by doing nothing.

00:10:01.685 --> 00:10:03.728 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
I thought if I worked harder,

00:10:03.812 --> 00:10:06.106 position:50% align:center
I'd feel better about myself.

Hey! Who had the three loaves?

Me!

00:10:49.441 --> 00:10:50.567 position:50% align:center
Were those for Leo?

But what happened to the girl?

00:10:52.777 --> 00:10:54.779 position:50% align:center
Now that you mention it,
I can't remember the last time

00:10:54.863 --> 00:10:56.281 position:50% align:center
that I saw her.

00:10:58.408 --> 00:10:59.826 position:50% align:center
Got 'em.

00:10:59.909 --> 00:11:02.078 position:50% align:center
And finished all the other
errands you asked me to do, Leo.

00:11:05.874 --> 00:11:07.000 position:50% align:center
[LEO]
Here.

00:11:09.044 --> 00:11:12.464 position:50% align:center
By the way, didn't you
have a female apprentice?

00:11:12.547 --> 00:11:15.216 position:50% align:center
When you got her, you didn't
need me helpin' out anymore.

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:16.676 position:50% align:center
She gone for good?

00:11:19.888 --> 00:11:22.682 position:50% align:center
Got it. Lemme know

00:11:38.782 --> 00:11:40.116 position:50% align:center
[LEO] Here's the
drawing you commissioned.

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:41.451 position:50% align:center
Have a look.

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:46.247 position:50% align:center
Managed to deliver it
faster than expected.

00:11:46.331 --> 00:11:48.249 position:50% align:center
I'm working at a faster
pace these days,

00:11:48.333 --> 00:11:50.085 position:50% align:center
since there're
fewer distractions.

[UBERTINO]
Hmm. Well, it's not half bad.

00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:56.800 position:50% align:center
I approve. Now go ahead and
take this to the woodcarver.

00:11:56.883 --> 00:11:57.967 position:50% align:center

Mm.

00:12:02.138 --> 00:12:04.432 position:50% align:center
Hold on.

00:12:04.516 --> 00:12:07.352 position:50% align:center
There's a job that came up,
and I thought of you.

00:12:08.687 --> 00:12:09.938 position:50% align:center
I want you to paint a mural.

00:12:10.021 --> 00:12:11.731 position:50% align:center
I need it done on the
ceiling of a nearby church

00:12:11.815 --> 00:12:13.274 position:50% align:center
in time for Easter.

00:12:13.358 --> 00:12:15.819 position:50% align:center
The master artisan of the
workshop I was going to use

00:12:15.902 --> 00:12:18.113 position:50% align:center
passed away. Given
the circumstances,

00:12:18.196 --> 00:12:21.282 position:50% align:center
there's not much time to work,
but it's still a big job.

00:12:21.366 --> 00:12:22.617 position:50% align:center
All right?

00:12:24.619 --> 00:12:26.788 position:50% align:center

Scusi, signore!

00:12:47.308 --> 00:12:52.480 position:50% align:center
So, um, do you have any idea
when Miss Arte is coming back?

00:12:52.564 --> 00:12:54.816 position:50% align:center
Sorry, kid, but who are you?

00:12:54.899 --> 00:12:56.067 position:50% align:center
Huh?!

00:12:58.111 --> 00:13:00.655 position:50% align:center
I don't believe my eyes!

00:13:00.739 --> 00:13:03.366 position:50% align:center
How long's it been since
the last time you were here?

00:13:03.450 --> 00:13:05.618 position:50% align:center
Do me a favor
and leave me alone.

00:13:05.702 --> 00:13:08.079 position:50% align:center
Lately, it seems like everyone
I run into wants to chat

00:13:08.163 --> 00:13:10.040 position:50% align:center
my ear off for some reason.

00:13:10.123 --> 00:13:11.458 position:50% align:center
I'm exhausted.

00:13:11.541 --> 00:13:14.044 position:50% align:center
Ha! Leo! The world
must be really ending

00:13:14.127 --> 00:13:16.963 position:50% align:center

So tired...

00:13:53.124 --> 00:13:54.959 position:50% align:center
I saw she hadn't
touched her food today,

00:13:55.043 --> 00:13:58.546 position:50% align:center
so, I-I looked inside her room,
and found her passed out.

00:13:58.630 --> 00:14:02.008 position:50% align:center
Uncle Yuri called for the doctor
to make sure it wasn't serious.

00:14:02.092 --> 00:14:04.678 position:50% align:center
[YURI] Katarina, go back to
your room and get some sleep.

00:14:04.761 --> 00:14:05.929 position:50% align:center
All right.

00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:09.891 position:50% align:center
You make sure to
get some rest, as well.

00:14:09.974 --> 00:14:12.560 position:50% align:center
[DAPHNE] I'll bring something
from the kitchen for you to eat.

00:14:18.775 --> 00:14:23.655 position:50% align:center
You know. While I'd like your
health to be my primary concern,

00:14:23.738 --> 00:14:25.448 position:50% align:center
unfortunately, it's not.

00:14:25.532 --> 00:14:29.119 position:50% align:center
You made my niece cry, and for
that, I'm unable to forgive you.

While you were passed out,

00:14:33.289 --> 00:14:35.709 position:50% align:center
Katarina was inconsolable.

00:14:37.252 --> 00:14:38.503 position:50% align:center
I didn't...

00:14:38.586 --> 00:14:40.839 position:50% align:center
Whatever your reasons are,
they don't interest me.

00:14:40.922 --> 00:14:43.675 position:50% align:center
To make sure this doesn't happen
again, you're to stop working

[MAID 11B] Daphne, have you
seen Lady Katarina?

I haven't.

00:14:58.982 --> 00:15:02.277 position:50% align:center
[MAID 11B] Oh dear. She'll be
late for her arithmetic lesson.

There you are, Lady Katarina!

Your teacher's waiting!

00:15:13.455 --> 00:15:14.456 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
Hmm?

00:15:14.539 --> 00:15:15.623 position:50% align:center
Ah!

00:15:24.632 --> 00:15:27.719 position:50% align:center
[ARTE] Lately, I feel like
I'm being watched by someone.

00:15:27.802 --> 00:15:30.013 position:50% align:center
Lady Katarina would be my guess.

00:15:30.096 --> 00:15:31.681 position:50% align:center
Or I'm imagining things.

00:15:31.765 --> 00:15:33.183 position:50% align:center
I doubt that.

00:15:33.266 --> 00:15:35.268 position:50% align:center
I've noticed it, too.

Although nobody can really
blame her for being concerned.

00:15:38.396 --> 00:15:40.315 position:50% align:center
She even asked me
about you before.

Heh.

00:16:21.981 --> 00:16:24.109 position:50% align:center
What're you doing?

00:16:24.192 --> 00:16:25.944 position:50% align:center
I'm just coming up
with some design ideas

00:16:26.027 --> 00:16:27.362 position:50% align:center
for different jewelry

Oh, like what?

00:16:30.907 --> 00:16:32.033 position:50% align:center
Take a look.

00:16:32.117 --> 00:16:33.034 position:50% align:center
You see?

00:16:33.118 --> 00:16:36.496 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Ooh. So pretty!

00:16:36.579 --> 00:16:38.790 position:50% align:center
I was visiting workshops around
the city so I could sketch

00:16:38.873 --> 00:16:41.001 position:50% align:center
a variety of ornamentations.

00:16:41.084 --> 00:16:43.545 position:50% align:center
Then, I used those initial
drawings as reference to come up

00:16:43.628 --> 00:16:45.296 position:50% align:center
with these ones.

00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:48.258 position:50% align:center
So... Is all that
research necessary?

00:16:48.341 --> 00:16:51.469 position:50% align:center
Absolutely. Whenever a
client commissions a painter

00:16:51.553 --> 00:16:53.555 position:50% align:center
to make a portrait,
we do everything we can

00:16:53.638 --> 00:16:56.349 position:50% align:center
to ensure they're
satisfied with the piece.

00:16:56.433 --> 00:16:59.269 position:50% align:center
The angle of the composition,
skin tone, amount of light,

00:16:59.352 --> 00:17:00.562 position:50% align:center
clothes and props.

00:17:00.645 --> 00:17:03.148 position:50% align:center
Artists take all those
factors into account.

00:17:03.231 --> 00:17:06.276 position:50% align:center
The more time devoted to
detail, the higher the quality.

00:17:06.359 --> 00:17:08.486 position:50% align:center
For instance, when designing
the jewelry and lace,

00:17:08.570 --> 00:17:11.281 position:50% align:center
that's an opportunity
for us to show our skill.

00:17:11.364 --> 00:17:13.074 position:50% align:center
It's those kinds of
flourishes that really help

00:17:13.158 --> 00:17:14.534 position:50% align:center
elevate our artwork.

00:17:14.617 --> 00:17:16.077 position:50% align:center

00:17:17.871 --> 00:17:20.498 position:50% align:center
the details in religious
paintings, as well.

00:17:20.582 --> 00:17:23.835 position:50% align:center

00:19:23.246 --> 00:19:25.331 position:50% align:center
Because I'm a noble.

00:19:25.415 --> 00:19:27.417 position:50% align:center
No matter how much
we want a say,

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:30.086 position:50% align:center
we can't choose which
family we're born into.

00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:32.005 position:50% align:center
I've accepted my fate.

00:19:32.088 --> 00:19:35.508 position:50% align:center
I'm the daughter of nobles,
and that's that.

00:19:35.592 --> 00:19:37.135 position:50% align:center
But have you?

00:19:37.218 --> 00:19:39.179 position:50% align:center
You can't change
your birth, either.

00:19:39.262 --> 00:19:40.764 position:50% align:center
Even if someone's jealous,

00:19:40.847 --> 00:19:43.391 position:50% align:center
you have to accept it,
like I did!

00:19:49.272 --> 00:19:50.732 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
Oh, Yuri!

00:19:50.815 --> 00:19:53.068 position:50% align:center
I hope you don't mind me
waiting in your room.

00:19:53.151 --> 00:19:54.903 position:50% align:center
There's something
I want to discuss.

00:19:56.905 --> 00:19:59.616 position:50% align:center
Is that my niece's portrait?

00:19:59.699 --> 00:20:02.744 position:50% align:center
Beautiful. Has she seen it yet?

00:20:02.827 --> 00:20:04.621 position:50% align:center
I showed it to her earlier.

00:20:04.704 --> 00:20:06.247 position:50% align:center
What did she say?

00:20:06.331 --> 00:20:07.874 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
Initially, very little.

00:20:07.957 --> 00:20:09.834 position:50% align:center
She took the painting and
marched straight to the workshop

00:20:09.918 --> 00:20:11.836 position:50% align:center
we visited the other day.

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:13.588 position:50% align:center
Before that...

00:20:13.672 --> 00:20:16.716 position:50% align:center
Then you also have the benefit
of being well-educated?

00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:18.385 position:50% align:center
That's amazing.

00:20:18.468 --> 00:20:20.095 position:50% align:center
It must be wonderful.

00:20:20.178 --> 00:20:22.347 position:50% align:center
I'm envious of you.

00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:23.973 position:50% align:center
[ARTE] Then she
showed him the painting,

00:20:24.057 --> 00:20:26.226 position:50% align:center
and even though he
didn't mean any harm...

00:20:26.309 --> 00:20:28.937 position:50% align:center
[KATARINA] Arte painted this
portrait, without anyone's help!

00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:31.189 position:50% align:center
Don't ever imply that she's
only a successful artist

00:20:31.272 --> 00:20:33.566 position:50% align:center
because she's a noblewoman!

00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:35.568 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
I was shocked.

00:20:35.652 --> 00:20:38.947 position:50% align:center
Afterwards, when we left,
she said she's finally accepted

00:20:39.030 --> 00:20:41.991 position:50% align:center
the fact she's a noble, and how
we can't decide or change

00:20:42.075 --> 00:20:44.285 position:50% align:center
what kind of life
we're born into.

00:20:48.456 --> 00:20:51.292 position:50% align:center
I knew asking you to come here
was the right decision.

00:20:51.376 --> 00:20:52.460 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:52.544 --> 00:20:55.463 position:50% align:center
Arte, be truthful.

00:20:55.547 --> 00:20:56.631 position:50% align:center
You belong here.

00:20:56.715 --> 00:20:58.883 position:50% align:center
Don't you want
to stay in Venice?

00:20:58.967 --> 00:21:00.802 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:00.885 --> 00:21:03.430 position:50% align:center
[YURI] If you remain, I'll
become your patron and guarantee

00:21:03.513 --> 00:21:06.641 position:50% align:center
you'll make enough to support
yourself and live independently.

00:21:06.725 --> 00:21:09.102 position:50% align:center
I'm offering you a chance at
the life you've secretly wanted

00:21:09.185 --> 00:21:11.438 position:50% align:center
this whole time.

00:21:11.521 --> 00:21:13.148 position:50% align:center
[ARTE gasps]

00:21:15.692 --> 00:21:17.777 position:50% align:center
[ARTE] If I wasn't a woman,
and if I didn't come

00:21:17.861 --> 00:21:19.904 position:50% align:center
from a noble background,
would you still be

00:21:19.988 --> 00:21:22.198 position:50% align:center
extending the offer?

00:21:22.282 --> 00:21:24.701 position:50% align:center
I remember you asking me
something similar before

00:21:24.784 --> 00:21:26.453 position:50% align:center
you agreed to travel here.

00:21:26.536 --> 00:21:27.579 position:50% align:center
You've been blessed with

00:21:27.662 --> 00:21:29.789 position:50% align:center
a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity, Arte.

00:21:29.873 --> 00:21:32.083 position:50% align:center
It'd be disrespectful to
the other painters out there

00:21:32.167 --> 00:21:34.085 position:50% align:center
for you to turn it down.

00:21:34.169 --> 00:21:35.170 position:50% align:center
[ARTE gasps]

00:21:35.253 --> 00:21:36.880 position:50% align:center
I'll wait for your answer.

00:21:36.963 --> 00:21:39.466 position:50% align:center
Think it over while you finish
my sister-in-law's portrait,

00:21:39.549 --> 00:21:41.593 position:50% align:center
then tell me what
you've decided.

00:21:52.854 --> 00:21:54.522 position:50% align:center
You realize there'll come
a time when you have to

00:21:54.606 --> 00:21:56.608 position:50% align:center
leave this workshop,
to venture out on your

00:21:56.691 --> 00:21:58.860 position:50% align:center
own and put your skills to use.

00:21:58.943 --> 00:22:00.737 position:50% align:center
That is, if you want
to make a proper living

00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:03.114 position:50% align:center
and put food on the table.

00:22:03.198 --> 00:22:05.617 position:50% align:center
View this trip as an
opportunity, Arte.

00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:07.994 position:50% align:center
While you're there,
think carefully,

00:22:08.078 --> 00:22:11.122 position:50% align:center
about everything I've said.

00:22:11.206 --> 00:22:15.168 position:50% align:center
And afterwards, when six months
is up and you finish your job,

00:22:15.251 --> 00:22:17.837 position:50% align:center
you don't have to return
if you don't want to.

00:23:56.770 --> 00:23:58.730 position:50% align:center
[ARTE] Throughout my journey,
I've met so many people

00:23:58.813 --> 00:24:00.440 position:50% align:center
who have helped me on my way.

00:24:00.523 --> 00:24:02.359 position:50% align:center
Thanks to them, different
roads have opened up,

00:24:02.442 --> 00:24:03.902 position:50% align:center
leading me to the future.

00:24:03.985 --> 00:24:07.614 position:50% align:center
But no one can choose which
path I should take, except me!

00:24:07.697 --> 00:24:10.617 position:50% align:center
Whatever route I decide on,
I'll keep moving forward!
