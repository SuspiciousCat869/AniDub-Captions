00:00:32.407 --> 00:00:34.200 position:50% align:center
[ARTE] Here! It's the piece
I promised you,

00:00:34.284 --> 00:00:36.745 position:50% align:center
in return for your help
with Maestro Ubertino.

00:00:36.828 --> 00:00:38.538 position:50% align:center
My, this is stunning!

00:00:38.621 --> 00:00:40.707 position:50% align:center
You never cease
to amaze me, Arte.

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:42.250 position:50% align:center
Speaking of which,

00:00:42.334 --> 00:00:44.919 position:50% align:center
I heard the guild members are
beginning to warm up to you.

00:00:45.003 --> 00:00:46.421 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
I think they might be!

00:00:46.504 --> 00:00:48.965 position:50% align:center
I've even started to make
a few friends there recently.

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:51.176 position:50% align:center
Well, isn't that nice?

00:00:51.259 --> 00:00:53.053 position:50% align:center
You really are a force
to be reckoned with,

00:00:53.136 --> 00:00:54.262 position:50% align:center
aren't you, my dear?

00:00:54.346 --> 00:00:55.472 position:50% align:center
[ARTE giggles]

00:01:03.271 --> 00:01:04.314 position:50% align:center
[YURI]
Hmm?

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.150 position:50% align:center
[YURI]
Hmm.

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:40.952 position:50% align:center
[VERONICA] Honestly, must you
always visit me unannounced?

00:02:41.036 --> 00:02:42.912 position:50% align:center
A less magnanimous
hostess would leave you

00:02:42.996 --> 00:02:44.664 position:50% align:center
out in the cold, you know.

00:02:44.748 --> 00:02:47.334 position:50% align:center
Oh my, is that so? My apologies.

00:02:47.417 --> 00:02:49.127 position:50% align:center
Then I'll be sure to
send notice next time,

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:51.713 position:50% align:center
so I don't become a burden
on the woman that I love.

00:02:51.796 --> 00:02:52.714 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:02:52.797 --> 00:02:55.342 position:50% align:center
Oh? You had your
portrait painted?

00:02:55.425 --> 00:02:57.802 position:50% align:center
[VERONICA] Yes. Done by
a talented young friend of mine,

00:02:57.886 --> 00:02:59.429 position:50% align:center
in exchange for my help.

00:02:59.512 --> 00:03:01.264 position:50% align:center
She's actually
a female apprentice,

00:03:01.348 --> 00:03:02.724 position:50% align:center
isn't that delightful?

00:03:02.807 --> 00:03:03.975 position:50% align:center
[YURI]
Hmm.

00:03:04.726 --> 00:03:06.102 position:50% align:center
[DARCIA]
Thank you again.

00:03:06.186 --> 00:03:07.771 position:50% align:center
I can't believe I randomly
met someone who's willing to

00:03:07.854 --> 00:03:09.647 position:50% align:center
teach me how
to read and write.

00:03:09.731 --> 00:03:11.691 position:50% align:center
But still, I thought
books were expensive.

00:03:11.775 --> 00:03:14.110 position:50% align:center
How does this Veronica
person have so many of them

00:03:14.194 --> 00:03:15.445 position:50% align:center
to lend out?

00:03:15.528 --> 00:03:16.821 position:50% align:center
Is she married to someone
wealthy or something?

00:03:16.905 --> 00:03:19.657 position:50% align:center
Oh no, she's actually
a very successful courtesan.

00:03:19.741 --> 00:03:23.495 position:50% align:center
gasps] Wait... You're friends...
with a courtesan?

00:03:24.704 --> 00:03:25.914 position:50% align:center
[YURI]
You there!

00:03:25.997 --> 00:03:29.042 position:50% align:center
I have been looking
all over Florence for you!

00:03:29.125 --> 00:03:31.002 position:50% align:center
It's an honor
to make your acquaintance,

00:03:31.086 --> 00:03:32.879 position:50% align:center
Signorina Artista.

00:03:34.089 --> 00:03:35.465 position:50% align:center
How did you...?

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:39.260 position:50% align:center
--[gasps]
--[shrieks]

00:03:39.344 --> 00:03:43.306 position:50% align:center
[LEO] House Falier? As in,
the noble family from Venice?

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.308 position:50% align:center
[YURI]
Ah, so you know of us!

00:03:45.392 --> 00:03:47.227 position:50% align:center
In that case, I suppose
we can dispense with

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:48.978 position:50% align:center
the lengthy introductions.

00:03:49.062 --> 00:03:50.438 position:50% align:center
I'm Yuri.

00:03:50.522 --> 00:03:53.149 position:50% align:center
So, tell me, what possible
business could a member of

00:03:53.233 --> 00:03:54.359 position:50% align:center
the Venetian
nobility have with

00:03:54.442 --> 00:03:56.778 position:50% align:center
a small Florentine
workshop like mine?

00:03:56.861 --> 00:03:58.988 position:50% align:center
Well, well, aren't you direct?

00:03:59.072 --> 00:04:00.907 position:50% align:center
I'll get right to
the point, then.

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:03.660 position:50% align:center
I require someone of
Arte's talents to accompany me

00:04:03.743 --> 00:04:06.371 position:50% align:center
to Venice, and
work for my family.

00:04:06.454 --> 00:04:07.497 position:50% align:center
[LEO]
Hmm?

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:08.498 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:04:08.581 --> 00:04:09.874 position:50% align:center
So that's it.

00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:11.918 position:50% align:center
You're asking my apprentice
to come work for you.

00:04:12.002 --> 00:04:13.294 position:50% align:center
And you want my permission.

00:04:13.378 --> 00:04:15.213 position:50% align:center
Right. I understand
that she has yet to

00:04:15.296 --> 00:04:17.549 position:50% align:center
complete her training,
but I would like to hire her

00:04:17.632 --> 00:04:18.800 position:50% align:center
for two jobs.

00:04:18.883 --> 00:04:20.301 position:50% align:center
The first is to paint.

00:04:20.385 --> 00:04:22.637 position:50% align:center
She'll be put on retainer
as the official portrait artist

00:04:22.721 --> 00:04:24.597 position:50% align:center
exclusively for our family.

00:04:24.681 --> 00:04:28.393 position:50% align:center
But for her second task,
which is far more important...

00:04:28.476 --> 00:04:31.688 position:50% align:center
She'll be mentoring my
niece, as her private tutor.

00:04:31.771 --> 00:04:32.981 position:50% align:center
Mentor her in what?

00:04:33.064 --> 00:04:34.524 position:50% align:center
Well.

00:04:34.607 --> 00:04:37.402 position:50% align:center
To put it politely, my niece is
quite willful and independent.

00:04:37.485 --> 00:04:39.237 position:50% align:center
But most people
would be far less kind,

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.657 position:50% align:center
and might prefer to call her
"stubborn" and "selfish."

00:04:42.741 --> 00:04:45.452 position:50% align:center
Every other tutor
she's had until now has quit

00:04:45.535 --> 00:04:47.704 position:50% align:center
because of her behavior.

00:04:47.787 --> 00:04:49.080 position:50% align:center
That's where you come in.

00:04:49.164 --> 00:04:51.666 position:50% align:center
I think you might just be
able to turn her around.

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.753 position:50% align:center
But what makes you
think I'd be a good fit?

00:04:54.836 --> 00:04:56.880 position:50% align:center
Well, on the artistic
side of things.

00:04:56.963 --> 00:04:58.256 position:50% align:center
Your work is brilliant.

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:59.674 position:50% align:center
How could anyone not be moved

00:04:59.758 --> 00:05:03.053 position:50% align:center
by such exquisitely
delicate craftsmanship?

00:05:03.136 --> 00:05:05.055 position:50% align:center
But to be honest,
the real reason I'm interested

00:05:05.138 --> 00:05:07.891 position:50% align:center
in hiring you specifically,
is that you are a woman

00:05:07.974 --> 00:05:09.893 position:50% align:center
who comes from a noble family.

00:05:09.976 --> 00:05:11.019 position:50% align:center
[ARTE gasps]

00:05:12.562 --> 00:05:15.482 position:50% align:center
[YURI] I sincerely hope
that you'll accept my offer.

00:05:15.565 --> 00:05:17.942 position:50% align:center
This is a decision
you can't make lightly.

00:05:18.026 --> 00:05:21.196 position:50% align:center
So I'll give you some time
to think it over.

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:23.740 position:50% align:center
I'll be looking
forward to your decision.

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:30.246 position:50% align:center
[LEO]
Arte? Wake up!

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:31.247 position:50% align:center
[yelps]

00:05:31.331 --> 00:05:32.290 position:50% align:center
Enough daydreaming!

00:05:32.374 --> 00:05:33.792 position:50% align:center
It's time to get to work.

00:05:33.875 --> 00:05:35.585 position:50% align:center
Yes! Right away, sir!

00:05:38.254 --> 00:05:40.090 position:50% align:center
You've got work to do, Arte.

00:05:40.173 --> 00:05:41.341 position:50% align:center
Focus.

00:05:41.424 --> 00:05:42.634 position:50% align:center
[YURI] The real reason
I'm interested in

00:05:42.717 --> 00:05:45.136 position:50% align:center
hiring you specifically,
is that you are a woman

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:47.263 position:50% align:center
who comes from a noble family.

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:50.850 position:50% align:center
[LEO] It's watery,
and there isn't enough

00:05:50.934 --> 00:05:52.477 position:50% align:center
seasoning in the broth.

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.271 position:50% align:center
You seem distracted,
is everything all right?

00:05:55.355 --> 00:05:56.481 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
I'm sorry.

00:05:57.774 --> 00:05:58.983 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:05:59.067 --> 00:06:00.360 position:50% align:center
Is it about earlier?

00:06:00.443 --> 00:06:03.780 position:50% align:center
Yes. I can't stop
thinking about it.

00:06:03.863 --> 00:06:06.574 position:50% align:center
I don't know if
I should accept the offer.

00:06:06.658 --> 00:06:08.910 position:50% align:center
The decision is
entirely yours to make.

00:06:08.993 --> 00:06:11.705 position:50% align:center
I have no right to say whether
or not you should take it.

00:06:14.666 --> 00:06:16.793 position:50% align:center
[LEO] Besides. An apprentice
being offered a job

00:06:16.876 --> 00:06:20.422 position:50% align:center
as big as this is
virtually unheard of.

00:06:20.505 --> 00:06:23.842 position:50% align:center
If that's the case,
shouldn't I accept the position?

00:06:23.925 --> 00:06:27.303 position:50% align:center
I'm lucky to even be getting
this kind of opportunity at all.

00:06:27.387 --> 00:06:29.097 position:50% align:center
[LEO]
If you want my opinion on it.

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:31.057 position:50% align:center
Don't think in terms of luck.

00:06:31.141 --> 00:06:32.475 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
Huh?

00:06:32.559 --> 00:06:34.185 position:50% align:center
[LEO] There are those
who believe that one needs

00:06:34.269 --> 00:06:38.273 position:50% align:center
both talent and luck in order to
be successful as an artisan.

00:06:38.356 --> 00:06:40.817 position:50% align:center
But I disagree with that.

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:43.611 position:50% align:center
My master always told me,
if I worked hard,

00:06:43.695 --> 00:06:46.781 position:50% align:center
then I would become skilled
enough to make a living.

00:06:46.865 --> 00:06:49.075 position:50% align:center
I still believe
that to this day.

00:06:49.159 --> 00:06:52.078 position:50% align:center
If you become a master of your
craft, then the work will come.

00:06:52.162 --> 00:06:53.788 position:50% align:center
So you don't need
to cling onto each job

00:06:53.872 --> 00:06:55.582 position:50% align:center
just because it's offered.

00:06:55.665 --> 00:06:57.000 position:50% align:center
I want you to know.

00:06:57.083 --> 00:06:59.669 position:50% align:center
I'll respect your decision
no matter what you choose.

00:07:01.379 --> 00:07:02.756 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
Thanks.

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:17.145 position:50% align:center
[giggles]
Ciao, Arte!

00:07:17.228 --> 00:07:18.938 position:50% align:center
How are you doing today?

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:21.733 position:50% align:center
I've decided!

00:07:21.816 --> 00:07:23.068 position:50% align:center
[yelps]

00:07:23.151 --> 00:07:25.987 position:50% align:center
Uh. Darcia?

00:07:26.071 --> 00:07:28.573 position:50% align:center
Please excuse me for
the sudden visit, Lord Yuri.

00:07:28.656 --> 00:07:30.867 position:50% align:center
I came here because
I'm ready to give you an answer

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:31.993 position:50% align:center
to your offer.

00:07:32.077 --> 00:07:33.661 position:50% align:center
What did you decide?

00:07:36.039 --> 00:07:37.540 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
At the workshop,

00:07:37.624 --> 00:07:40.126 position:50% align:center
you said you wanted to hire me
because I'm a noblewoman,

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:42.629 position:50% align:center
but being a noble and being a
woman have proven to be

00:07:42.712 --> 00:07:45.090 position:50% align:center
obstacles between
me and my goals.

00:07:45.173 --> 00:07:47.008 position:50% align:center
That's why, when you said that,

00:07:47.092 --> 00:07:49.052 position:50% align:center
I couldn't help feeling angry.

00:07:49.135 --> 00:07:51.763 position:50% align:center
So angry, that it took me
a few days to calm down,

00:07:51.846 --> 00:07:54.474 position:50% align:center
think clearly, and
come to a sound choice.

00:07:54.557 --> 00:07:57.894 position:50% align:center
Lord Yuri. I appreciate
your generous offer.

00:07:57.977 --> 00:07:59.437 position:50% align:center
I really do.

00:07:59.521 --> 00:08:02.107 position:50% align:center
But I'm afraid that I'll
have to decline for now.

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:04.067 position:50% align:center
I still have so many
things to learn about

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:05.568 position:50% align:center
being an artist.

00:08:05.652 --> 00:08:07.570 position:50% align:center
So I want to
continue my studies.

00:08:07.654 --> 00:08:09.989 position:50% align:center
I have to practice until I feel
confident that my work

00:08:10.073 --> 00:08:12.242 position:50% align:center
will satisfy my customers.

00:08:12.325 --> 00:08:16.621 position:50% align:center
I won't be ready to take on jobs
until that point in time.

00:08:16.705 --> 00:08:17.664 position:50% align:center
That's all.

00:08:17.747 --> 00:08:20.333 position:50% align:center
I hope you can
understand my decision.

00:08:20.417 --> 00:08:22.711 position:50% align:center
I see. Sorry to hear that.

00:08:22.794 --> 00:08:24.879 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
Well, please excuse me.

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:29.884 position:50% align:center
[YURI]
Setting work aside.

00:08:29.968 --> 00:08:31.636 position:50% align:center
If you ever need
anything in the future,

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:33.972 position:50% align:center
please don't hesitate to ask.

00:08:34.055 --> 00:08:35.598 position:50% align:center
My door will
always be open to you,

00:08:35.682 --> 00:08:37.559 position:50% align:center
and I'll do my best to help.

00:08:37.642 --> 00:08:39.227 position:50% align:center
Thanks!

00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:42.605 position:50% align:center
[sighs] Wow, it's as if

It feels so nice to not have
to worry about that anymore!

Scusi! Signorina?

Could I please ask you
for directions?

00:08:53.199 --> 00:08:55.952 position:50% align:center
Ah! Your belly is so big.

00:08:56.036 --> 00:08:58.705 position:50% align:center
[RUTHANNA laughs]
Yes, and getting bigger!

00:08:58.788 --> 00:09:00.915 position:50% align:center
Thank goodness we're almost
done, I don't think my back

00:09:00.999 --> 00:09:02.584 position:50% align:center
can take much more of this.

00:09:04.002 --> 00:09:05.837 position:50% align:center
I'm here to see an old friend
for the first time

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:08.840 position:50% align:center
in ten years, but I can't
seem to find his place.

Is it in the area?

00:09:10.467 --> 00:09:12.886 position:50% align:center
If you'd like, I could
help you look around for it!

00:09:12.969 --> 00:09:14.512 position:50% align:center
Really, you would?

00:09:14.596 --> 00:09:15.764 position:50% align:center
That would be great!

00:09:15.847 --> 00:09:18.224 position:50% align:center
He runs a small workshop
somewhere around here.

00:09:18.308 --> 00:09:19.726 position:50% align:center
I don't think he's very famous,

00:09:19.809 --> 00:09:22.187 position:50% align:center
but perhaps it's possible
you've heard of him!

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:24.856 position:50% align:center
He's a professional painter
and his name is Leo.

Leo?!

00:09:27.859 --> 00:09:29.652 position:50% align:center
What? Yours?!

00:09:29.736 --> 00:09:31.863 position:50% align:center
Yeah, it's kind of
a complicated story,

00:09:31.946 --> 00:09:34.282 position:50% align:center
but Arte here is officially
my apprentice.

00:09:34.366 --> 00:09:36.159 position:50% align:center
She's been with me
for a while now.

00:09:36.242 --> 00:09:37.285 position:50% align:center
[RUTHANNA]
There's no way.

00:09:37.369 --> 00:09:38.620 position:50% align:center
Your apprentice?

00:09:38.703 --> 00:09:40.955 position:50% align:center
And you're telling me
she's from a noble family?

00:09:41.039 --> 00:09:42.791 position:50% align:center
There's so much
to say about all of this,

00:09:42.874 --> 00:09:44.959 position:50% align:center
I don't even know
where to begin.

00:09:45.043 --> 00:09:46.336 position:50% align:center
My name is Ruthanna!

00:09:46.419 --> 00:09:48.713 position:50% align:center
Your master and I
are old friends!

00:09:48.797 --> 00:09:50.965 position:50% align:center
I see getting older
hasn't mellowed you out.

00:09:51.049 --> 00:09:53.426 position:50% align:center
Calm down would you?
You're scaring her.

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:54.427 position:50% align:center
I'm just surprised to hear

00:09:54.511 --> 00:09:56.388 position:50% align:center
that Leo has another friend.

00:09:58.348 --> 00:10:01.726 position:50% align:center
[laughs]
You really are his apprentice!

00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:04.312 position:50% align:center
That's right, he doesn't seem
like he would have any friends!

00:10:04.396 --> 00:10:06.314 position:50% align:center
Careful, Leo, she's on to you.

--Hey.

living out in Siena, right?

Your husband,
did he come, too?

00:10:13.238 --> 00:10:15.240 position:50% align:center

Oh, no.

00:10:15.323 --> 00:10:16.700 position:50% align:center
My husband isn't with me.

00:10:16.783 --> 00:10:17.992 position:50% align:center
Really?

00:10:18.076 --> 00:10:21.037 position:50% align:center
So then you came all
the way here by yourself?

00:10:21.121 --> 00:10:23.289 position:50% align:center
Yes. It's just me now.

00:10:26.167 --> 00:10:28.670 position:50% align:center
Arte. I need to talk
to Ruthanna alone.

00:10:28.753 --> 00:10:30.338 position:50% align:center
Can you give us some privacy?

00:10:35.719 --> 00:10:37.137 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
Now that I think about it.

00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:39.472 position:50% align:center
I've never seen Leo be
so friendly with anyone

00:10:39.556 --> 00:10:41.099 position:50% align:center
who wasn't a patron of his.

00:10:41.182 --> 00:10:43.977 position:50% align:center
He's always so serious.

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:46.396 position:50% align:center
[RUTHANNA] I still can't believe
you took in such a cute girl

00:10:46.479 --> 00:10:47.897 position:50% align:center
as your apprentice.

00:10:47.981 --> 00:10:49.899 position:50% align:center
Arte, do your best
to learn as much as you can

00:10:49.983 --> 00:10:51.693 position:50% align:center
from him, but make sure
you don't pick up

00:10:51.776 --> 00:10:52.694 position:50% align:center
on his grouchiness.

00:10:52.777 --> 00:10:53.862 position:50% align:center

Goodbye, you two.

[DARCIA gasps]
Arte!

00:11:31.066 --> 00:11:32.275 position:50% align:center
Wait a second!

00:11:36.613 --> 00:11:38.698 position:50% align:center
[DARCIA] I think I've
heard about Ruthanna!

00:11:38.782 --> 00:11:40.950 position:50% align:center
Some of my seamstress friends
were talking about her.

00:11:41.034 --> 00:11:42.660 position:50% align:center
She used to live in Florence.

00:11:42.744 --> 00:11:45.789 position:50% align:center
But she moved to Siena with her
husband after getting married.

00:11:45.872 --> 00:11:48.625 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, I heard
he recently passed away.

00:11:48.708 --> 00:11:51.419 position:50% align:center
[gasps] She seemed so cheerful,
I never would have thought

00:11:51.503 --> 00:11:52.837 position:50% align:center
that was the case.

00:11:52.921 --> 00:11:54.631 position:50% align:center
I heard that her
late husband's family won't

00:11:54.714 --> 00:11:56.966 position:50% align:center
return her dowry from
when she got married,

00:11:57.050 --> 00:11:59.678 position:50% align:center
so she came here to try
to negotiate with them,

00:11:59.761 --> 00:12:03.264 position:50% align:center
but I'm not sure that she's
going to be able to get it back.

00:12:03.348 --> 00:12:06.434 position:50% align:center
But isn't it customary for
a woman to get her dowry back

00:12:06.518 --> 00:12:08.728 position:50% align:center
if she becomes a widow?

00:12:08.812 --> 00:12:11.189 position:50% align:center
Well, that's the way it's
supposed to be, yes.

00:12:11.272 --> 00:12:13.566 position:50% align:center
So then, what's she
have to do with you?

00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:15.485 position:50% align:center
She and Master Leo
have been close friends

00:12:15.568 --> 00:12:17.112 position:50% align:center
for a really long time.

I can do to help her.

You know, before
my husband died,

00:13:14.961 --> 00:13:17.464 position:50% align:center
we really were happy together.

00:13:17.547 --> 00:13:19.507 position:50% align:center
At first, I was nervous,
being married off

00:13:19.591 --> 00:13:22.969 position:50% align:center
to someone I didn't know,
but we were a good match.

00:13:23.053 --> 00:13:26.264 position:50% align:center
We lived a blissful life
in Siena together.

00:13:26.348 --> 00:13:29.934 position:50% align:center
But, right after I got pregnant,
the epidemic came,

00:13:30.018 --> 00:13:31.728 position:50% align:center
and he fell ill and died.

00:13:33.146 --> 00:13:35.482 position:50% align:center
That's why I want to raise
our child in the same town

00:13:35.565 --> 00:13:36.816 position:50% align:center
where we lived back then.

00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:39.527 position:50% align:center
I want them to experience
the joy we shared.

I'm so sorry...

00:13:41.404 --> 00:13:44.157 position:50% align:center
But anyway, that's enough
complaining about my problems!

got himself an apprentice!

00:13:48.787 --> 00:13:49.996 position:50% align:center
[RUTHANNA]
Even when he was young,

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:51.664 position:50% align:center
he always kept to himself.

00:13:51.748 --> 00:13:53.792 position:50% align:center
He was constantly
covered in scrapes,

00:13:53.875 --> 00:13:55.168 position:50% align:center
as if he'd been fighting.

00:13:55.251 --> 00:13:58.088 position:50% align:center
And he never
opened up to anyone.

00:13:58.171 --> 00:13:59.631 position:50% align:center
Thinking back on it.

00:13:59.714 --> 00:14:01.508 position:50% align:center
I'm sure he only talked
to me because I was

00:14:01.591 --> 00:14:03.468 position:50% align:center
his master's daughter.

00:14:05.178 --> 00:14:08.014 position:50% align:center
But it seems there's hope
for my cranky old friend.

00:14:08.098 --> 00:14:11.309 position:50% align:center
He's found himself
a lovely young apprentice.

see someone kind like

return to Florence.

I can only imagine what
the neighbors will say.

00:14:34.165 --> 00:14:37.085 position:50% align:center
The only reason we let her marry
into our family was because of

00:14:37.168 --> 00:14:38.420 position:50% align:center
her large dowry!

Why else would we take
in some artist's daughter?

And now she's insisting
on her "rights."

you her answer already.

00:15:24.299 --> 00:15:25.842 position:50% align:center
She made her own decision.

00:15:25.925 --> 00:15:28.261 position:50% align:center
It's not my place to
tell her what to choose.

00:15:28.345 --> 00:15:30.013 position:50% align:center
I'd like to agree with you.

00:15:30.096 --> 00:15:32.015 position:50% align:center
That it's up to Arte to decide.

00:15:32.098 --> 00:15:34.351 position:50% align:center
But the truth is not so simple.

00:15:34.434 --> 00:15:37.020 position:50% align:center
She doesn't have a clue how
much an artist has to suffer

00:15:37.103 --> 00:15:39.356 position:50% align:center
in order to put food
on their table.

00:15:39.439 --> 00:15:42.108 position:50% align:center
So many spend their lives
fawning over the rich,

00:15:42.192 --> 00:15:44.652 position:50% align:center
polishing their sycophancy
over their craft,

00:15:44.736 --> 00:15:47.655 position:50% align:center
only to walk away
empty-handed.

00:15:47.739 --> 00:15:50.700 position:50% align:center
In such a harsh world, it would
be unthinkable to throw away

00:15:50.784 --> 00:15:52.702 position:50% align:center
a chance like the
one I gave her.

00:15:52.786 --> 00:15:56.414 position:50% align:center
And yet, such a baffling
refusal might make sense,

00:15:56.498 --> 00:15:59.959 position:50% align:center
if the master she so reveres
told her she shouldn't accept.

00:16:00.043 --> 00:16:01.670 position:50% align:center

The only reason we let her marry

00:18:31.403 --> 00:18:33.738 position:50% align:center
Before I go,

After I've finished this job,

for someone that you just met,

00:18:51.256 --> 00:18:52.882 position:50% align:center

no changing your mind

I agree. It's been too long.

00:21:55.357 --> 00:21:57.650 position:50% align:center
Well, until next time, Ruthanna.

00:21:57.734 --> 00:22:00.111 position:50% align:center
Right. Arrivederci!

00:22:03.239 --> 00:22:04.991 position:50% align:center
Arte.

00:22:05.075 --> 00:22:07.035 position:50% align:center
Take care of him
for me, would you?

00:22:07.118 --> 00:22:08.328 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
Huh?

00:22:11.581 --> 00:22:14.751 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
Me? Take care of Leo?

00:22:16.419 --> 00:22:17.962 position:50% align:center
Hey. Come on.

00:22:18.046 --> 00:22:19.589 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
Ah! Right!

00:23:56.561 --> 00:23:58.480 position:50% align:center
[ARTE] We won't be able to
see each other for a while,

00:23:58.563 --> 00:24:00.523 position:50% align:center
but I hope you'll keep
studying, Darcia!

00:24:00.607 --> 00:24:02.734 position:50% align:center
[DARCIA] You're going to do
great over there, Arte!

00:24:02.817 --> 00:24:04.361 position:50% align:center
[ARTE] Even though I'm
feeling really nervous,

00:24:04.444 --> 00:24:06.029 position:50% align:center
I'll keep moving forward!

00:24:06.112 --> 00:24:07.864 position:50% align:center
Next time:
"A New Chapter."

00:24:07.947 --> 00:24:09.949 position:50% align:center
I can't wait to see
what's in store for me!
