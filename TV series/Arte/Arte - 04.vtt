[NARRATOR]
Florence, the 16th century.

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:41.583 position:50% align:center
During the Renaissance,
most commoners didn't have

00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:43.293 position:50% align:center
stone ovens in their homes.

00:00:43.376 --> 00:00:45.670 position:50% align:center
Instead, they were required
to either share one

00:00:45.754 --> 00:00:49.591 position:50% align:center
or bring their dough to a baker
who would prepare it for them.

00:00:49.674 --> 00:00:51.343 position:50% align:center
Ehi! This batch is finished!

00:00:51.426 --> 00:00:53.928 position:50% align:center
Which one of you is waiting on
the four loaves?

00:00:54.012 --> 00:00:57.140 position:50% align:center
Over here! That's my order!

00:00:57.223 --> 00:00:58.808 position:50% align:center
[BAKER 04A]
Well, look who it is!

00:00:58.892 --> 00:01:00.685 position:50% align:center
Did you give the leavening
agent I told you about

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:01.936 position:50% align:center
last time a try?

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.522 position:50% align:center
Actually, it's in
the dough I brought today!

00:01:04.606 --> 00:01:06.900 position:50% align:center
You be sure to let me
know how it turned out!

00:01:06.983 --> 00:01:08.068 position:50% align:center
Right!

00:01:14.324 --> 00:01:17.077 position:50% align:center
[ARTE] Master Leo.
I'm back from my errands!

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:18.370 position:50% align:center
All right.

00:01:18.453 --> 00:01:21.539 position:50% align:center
Let's get the workshop
cleaned up before we eat.

00:01:21.623 --> 00:01:22.791 position:50% align:center
Put these away.

00:01:22.874 --> 00:01:23.875 position:50% align:center
And don't dawdle.

00:01:23.958 --> 00:01:25.085 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
Of course!

00:01:28.546 --> 00:01:30.006 position:50% align:center
[shrieks]

00:01:31.007 --> 00:01:32.926 position:50% align:center
[LEO] Arte, what's wrong
with you today?

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:34.427 position:50% align:center
Isn't that the question!

00:03:09.064 --> 00:03:12.067 position:50% align:center
[ARTE] The other day,
when Leo was holding me close,

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.652 position:50% align:center
my chest suddenly
started to hurt.

00:03:14.736 --> 00:03:19.032 position:50% align:center
Ever since, I've had
the strangest feeling.

00:03:19.115 --> 00:03:20.450 position:50% align:center
For instance...

00:03:20.533 --> 00:03:22.994 position:50% align:center
I can hardly breathe when
his face is close to mine.

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:26.623 position:50% align:center
[ARTE] And I find myself
completely overreacting

00:03:26.706 --> 00:03:29.751 position:50% align:center
when our shoulders
accidentally brush.

00:03:29.834 --> 00:03:31.378 position:50% align:center
I can barely even concentrate,

00:03:31.461 --> 00:03:33.922 position:50% align:center
and I keep getting
into trouble for it.

00:03:34.005 --> 00:03:35.256 position:50% align:center
I don't know.

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.467 position:50% align:center
Maybe there's something
wrong with me, after all.

00:03:41.471 --> 00:03:43.932 position:50% align:center
--[LEO] Here.
--Oh. Grazie, Master Leo.

00:03:48.853 --> 00:03:51.481 position:50% align:center
[LEO] Mm. The bread's
different than usual.

00:03:51.564 --> 00:03:53.942 position:50% align:center
The baker I take the dough
to gave me a suggestion,

00:03:54.025 --> 00:03:56.194 position:50% align:center
and I tried it out
with this batch.

00:03:56.277 --> 00:03:58.738 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:03:58.822 --> 00:04:00.740 position:50% align:center
Mm. It is quite good.

00:04:00.824 --> 00:04:03.576 position:50% align:center
[ARTE] You'd never be able to
tell if he liked it or not.

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.539 position:50% align:center
Master Leo only smiles in
extremely rare instances.

00:04:07.622 --> 00:04:09.332 position:50% align:center
And it's anyone's
guess when it will happen,

00:04:09.416 --> 00:04:10.750 position:50% align:center
or for what reason.

00:04:10.834 --> 00:04:13.378 position:50% align:center
He's impossible to read.

00:04:13.461 --> 00:04:16.756 position:50% align:center
So. When he smiled at me
that way the other night,

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.634 position:50% align:center
it caught me
completely off-guard.

00:04:19.718 --> 00:04:22.554 position:50% align:center
Maybe that's what
made my chest hurt.

00:04:22.637 --> 00:04:25.056 position:50% align:center
I wonder if he'll ever
smile at me like that again.

00:04:26.558 --> 00:04:27.976 position:50% align:center
[ARTE] If he does,
there's a chance I'll be able

00:04:28.059 --> 00:04:30.562 position:50% align:center
to figure out why I've
been feeling this way.

00:04:30.645 --> 00:04:33.356 position:50% align:center
Arte! Did you hear me?

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:34.733 position:50% align:center
Yes! I mean...

00:04:34.816 --> 00:04:37.027 position:50% align:center
No, could you repeat that?

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:38.278 position:50% align:center
Just finish your food.

00:04:38.361 --> 00:04:39.863 position:50% align:center
We have a lot of work to do.

00:04:39.946 --> 00:04:41.031 position:50% align:center
Right!

00:04:41.114 --> 00:04:42.449 position:50% align:center
[LEO]
Get your head out of the clouds.

00:04:42.532 --> 00:04:43.616 position:50% align:center
Are you ill or something?

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.910 position:50% align:center
No! I feel fine!

00:04:45.994 --> 00:04:47.871 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
Mortified, but fine.

00:04:49.247 --> 00:04:50.915 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
Another portrait?

00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:54.002 position:50% align:center
[LEO] Yeah. This one's for
a regular patron of mine.

00:04:54.085 --> 00:04:56.463 position:50% align:center
It's a typical request for her.

00:04:56.546 --> 00:04:57.756 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
Oh.

00:04:57.839 --> 00:04:59.382 position:50% align:center
[LEO] You'll recognize her
when you see her.

00:04:59.466 --> 00:05:00.842 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
Huh?

00:05:00.925 --> 00:05:03.345 position:50% align:center
[LEO] You've met. She's the
courtesan from Carnevale.

00:05:03.428 --> 00:05:04.554 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
Oh...

00:05:09.476 --> 00:05:11.019 position:50% align:center
Please wait here a moment.

00:05:16.066 --> 00:05:20.362 position:50% align:center
[gasps] From the looks of it,
her family comes from wealth.

00:05:20.445 --> 00:05:21.780 position:50% align:center
[LEO]
No.

00:05:21.863 --> 00:05:23.656 position:50% align:center
Everything that you can see here
she earned for herself,

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.450 position:50% align:center
thanks to her profession.

00:05:25.533 --> 00:05:28.244 position:50% align:center
What? She's... done well.

00:05:28.328 --> 00:05:29.996 position:50% align:center
I understand she's also
supporting her mother

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.540 position:50% align:center
along with a young
brother and sister.

00:05:32.624 --> 00:05:33.541 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:05:33.625 --> 00:05:35.752 position:50% align:center
[VERONICA]
Leo! Good to see you.

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:40.048 position:50% align:center
Perfect timing, as per usual!

00:05:41.257 --> 00:05:43.635 position:50% align:center
[VERONICA]
Well, this is unexpected.

00:05:43.718 --> 00:05:45.303 position:50% align:center
You brought
a young woman with you.

00:05:45.387 --> 00:05:46.971 position:50% align:center
Yes, this is...

00:05:49.391 --> 00:05:51.476 position:50% align:center
[ARTE] I'm Master Leo's
apprentice, Arte.

00:05:51.559 --> 00:05:53.353 position:50% align:center
At your service.

00:05:53.436 --> 00:05:56.856 position:50% align:center
Oh, my. [giggles]
So polite and dignified.

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:59.484 position:50% align:center
Not what I was expecting
from Leo's trainee.

00:05:59.567 --> 00:06:01.069 position:50% align:center
It's a pleasure to meet you.

00:06:01.152 --> 00:06:03.446 position:50% align:center
I'm Veronica.

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:05.281 position:50% align:center
This one will be
for a gentleman who prefers

00:06:05.365 --> 00:06:06.991 position:50% align:center
an intellectual woman.

00:06:07.075 --> 00:06:09.119 position:50% align:center
So I decided on the study
as a background,

00:06:09.202 --> 00:06:10.870 position:50% align:center
and a book as a prop.

00:06:10.954 --> 00:06:12.956 position:50% align:center
I can hold it or
lay it in my lap,

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:14.582 position:50% align:center
whichever you
think is better.

00:06:14.666 --> 00:06:15.875 position:50% align:center
Oh?

00:06:15.959 --> 00:06:17.127 position:50% align:center
What is it?

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:18.503 position:50% align:center
Don't mind me!

00:06:18.586 --> 00:06:21.089 position:50% align:center
I was just admiring how
impressive your library is.

00:06:21.172 --> 00:06:23.008 position:50% align:center
If one wishes
to entertain a gentleman,

00:06:23.091 --> 00:06:24.634 position:50% align:center
education is essential.

00:06:24.718 --> 00:06:27.470 position:50% align:center
Would you believe I've read
every book you see here?

00:06:27.554 --> 00:06:29.556 position:50% align:center
That's... amazing!

00:06:31.391 --> 00:06:32.976 position:50% align:center
Heh. You're a funny one!

00:06:33.059 --> 00:06:34.060 position:50% align:center
Huh?!

00:06:34.144 --> 00:06:35.478 position:50% align:center
But wait, the apprentice
you had with you

00:06:35.562 --> 00:06:39.065 position:50% align:center
at Carnevale was a boy.
Did you scare him off already?

00:06:39.149 --> 00:06:40.650 position:50% align:center
This is the same person.

00:06:40.734 --> 00:06:41.818 position:50% align:center
Ah?

00:06:42.569 --> 00:06:44.654 position:50% align:center
Uh... [chuckles]

00:06:44.738 --> 00:06:45.822 position:50% align:center
Ah--

00:06:47.907 --> 00:06:50.827 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:53.246 position:50% align:center
And here I was going on
about being clever!

00:06:53.329 --> 00:06:54.706 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:06:54.789 --> 00:06:56.249 position:50% align:center
[ARTE gasps]

00:06:56.332 --> 00:06:57.792 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
Now that I'm seeing her again,

00:06:57.876 --> 00:07:00.086 position:50% align:center
Veronica's beauty
is overwhelming,

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:03.840 position:50% align:center
and she has
the loveliest expressions.

00:07:03.923 --> 00:07:06.343 position:50% align:center
[VERONICA] So, you're
taken in by the study.

00:07:06.426 --> 00:07:07.469 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:07:07.552 --> 00:07:08.636 position:50% align:center
Would you care to
borrow some books

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.472 position:50% align:center
from my collection?

00:07:10.555 --> 00:07:12.640 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
What? You're really offering?

00:07:12.724 --> 00:07:15.268 position:50% align:center
Because I'd love to!

00:07:15.352 --> 00:07:17.979 position:50% align:center
Your name, you said
it was Arte, right?

00:07:18.063 --> 00:07:19.230 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
Yes!

00:07:19.314 --> 00:07:20.565 position:50% align:center
Arte, my dear.

00:07:20.648 --> 00:07:23.568 position:50% align:center
I believe I'm sensing
some admiration from you.

00:07:23.651 --> 00:07:25.570 position:50% align:center
I'd hate for you to be
disappointed when you find out

00:07:25.653 --> 00:07:27.447 position:50% align:center
what my profession entails.

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:30.700 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
Oh, because you're a courtesan?

00:07:30.784 --> 00:07:33.495 position:50% align:center
I've heard things
about what that means.

00:07:33.578 --> 00:07:36.247 position:50% align:center
And yet,
standing in your library,

00:07:36.331 --> 00:07:38.208 position:50% align:center
it's impossible for me
to view you with anything

00:07:38.291 --> 00:07:40.418 position:50% align:center
but abject respect.

00:07:40.502 --> 00:07:43.546 position:50% align:center
Your profession isn't
what makes me admire you.

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:46.466 position:50% align:center
My respect... is
for how hard you work.

00:07:50.053 --> 00:07:50.970 position:50% align:center
Leo.

00:07:51.054 --> 00:07:51.971 position:50% align:center
[LEO]
Yes?

00:07:52.055 --> 00:07:54.307 position:50% align:center
I like her, so here's the deal.

00:07:54.391 --> 00:07:58.019 position:50% align:center
This time. I want her
to paint my portrait instead.

00:07:58.103 --> 00:07:59.354 position:50% align:center
--[ARTE] Huh...?
--As for payment?

00:07:59.437 --> 00:08:00.980 position:50% align:center
The usual amount
including the cost

00:08:01.064 --> 00:08:03.233 position:50% align:center
for her materials, naturally.

00:08:03.316 --> 00:08:04.693 position:50% align:center
[LEO]
Understood.

00:08:04.776 --> 00:08:08.405 position:50% align:center
Well, Arte. Looks like you've
got your first real job.

00:08:08.488 --> 00:08:09.572 position:50% align:center
[ARTE whimpers]

00:08:11.658 --> 00:08:13.618 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
Evviva!

00:08:13.702 --> 00:08:16.996 position:50% align:center
[ARTE] And that's how I received
my first ever commission!

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:20.375 position:50% align:center
Soon after, I began visiting
Veronica on a regular basis

00:08:20.458 --> 00:08:22.335 position:50% align:center
in order to work
on her portrait.

00:08:23.503 --> 00:08:25.714 position:50% align:center
[ARTE] She was always kind
to me, even though I was just

00:08:25.797 --> 00:08:27.632 position:50% align:center
a painter's apprentice.

00:08:27.716 --> 00:08:29.551 position:50% align:center
Salons were often
held at her house,

00:08:29.634 --> 00:08:31.052 position:50% align:center
where she'd entertain
gentlemen with

00:08:31.136 --> 00:08:34.264 position:50% align:center
her wealth of knowledge and her
gentle manner of speaking.

00:08:37.058 --> 00:08:39.519 position:50% align:center
[ARTE] Whenever I visited,
she always had a book in hand,

00:08:39.602 --> 00:08:42.647 position:50% align:center
and any time she could spare,
she dedicated to reading.

00:08:44.566 --> 00:08:47.318 position:50% align:center
[ARTE] And the more I learned
about her as a person,

00:08:47.402 --> 00:08:50.989 position:50% align:center
the more I grew to admire her,
and enjoy her company.

00:08:52.532 --> 00:08:54.743 position:50% align:center
[LEO] She let you
borrow even more books?

00:08:54.826 --> 00:08:56.244 position:50% align:center
You'd better believe it!

00:08:56.327 --> 00:08:57.829 position:50% align:center
There's not a single
uninteresting book

00:08:57.912 --> 00:08:59.706 position:50% align:center
in that entire library!

00:08:59.789 --> 00:09:01.332 position:50% align:center
Not only that, she picks
them out especially for me!

00:09:01.416 --> 00:09:02.792 position:50% align:center

[MAN 04C] When you were with
her, did she mention

Ah. My apologies.

00:16:26.236 --> 00:16:29.364 position:50% align:center
It was improper of me

00:16:29.447 --> 00:16:33.034 position:50% align:center
I feel like I'm losing
my mind over her.

talking to other men.

Where is this coming from?

That poor man.

00:16:57.058 --> 00:16:59.185 position:50% align:center
You made him wait
all day again, didn't you?

00:16:59.269 --> 00:17:01.229 position:50% align:center
Oh. Is that it?

00:17:01.312 --> 00:17:04.232 position:50% align:center
I told you, that's just

So it really doesn't bother you.

You did.

someone that way...

Today, I saw something
frightening hidden

00:18:03.416 --> 00:18:05.293 position:50% align:center
Nothing, I thought
I saw a smudge!

[LEO] Hmm? Well,
it's far from a disaster.

00:18:08.672 --> 00:18:09.839 position:50% align:center
You've done well so far.

00:18:09.923 --> 00:18:11.966 position:50% align:center
Keep up the good work, Arte.

00:18:12.050 --> 00:18:13.176 position:50% align:center
Once you're finished,

00:18:13.259 --> 00:18:15.512 position:50% align:center
I'll review it and make
any necessary changes.

00:18:15.595 --> 00:18:17.055 position:50% align:center
Ah! Right.

00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:22.852 position:50% align:center
[ARTE] I haven't been back to
Veronica's since that day.

00:18:22.936 --> 00:18:25.563 position:50% align:center
The painting's
nearly complete now.

00:18:25.647 --> 00:18:27.774 position:50% align:center
Which means I'll have
to deliver it to her.

00:18:29.317 --> 00:18:31.653 position:50% align:center
Ah! I can't concentrate!

00:18:32.654 --> 00:18:36.032 position:50% align:center

Ciao, signore.

00:18:42.288 --> 00:18:44.541 position:50% align:center
[ARTE] Oh, yes!
Thank you again for the tip!

00:18:44.624 --> 00:18:46.793 position:50% align:center
It ended up being delicious!

00:18:46.876 --> 00:18:48.920 position:50% align:center
Ah, it makes all
the difference, doesn't it?

00:18:49.004 --> 00:18:50.338 position:50% align:center
A trick of the trade.

Nothing to be so smug about.

You sure told them.

After everything
that those men said to you,

00:19:51.358 --> 00:19:53.151 position:50% align:center
somehow, you kept smiling.
