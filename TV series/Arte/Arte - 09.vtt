[MALTA]
You truly are our savior.

00:00:34.034 --> 00:00:36.369 position:50% align:center
I never thought we'd be able
to find a new etiquette tutor

00:00:36.453 --> 00:00:38.038 position:50% align:center
on such short notice.

00:00:38.121 --> 00:00:39.789 position:50% align:center
So here's to number ten.

00:00:39.873 --> 00:00:42.208 position:50% align:center
Or perhaps it's closer to 15.

00:00:42.292 --> 00:00:43.293 position:50% align:center

Darling, please.

[MALTA] These two young
ladies tutor my daughter

00:00:46.171 --> 00:00:47.547 position:50% align:center
in music and history.

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:49.841 position:50% align:center
They reside in the house,
whereas her arithmetic

00:00:49.924 --> 00:00:52.302 position:50% align:center
and poetry tutors
travel to and from.

00:00:52.385 --> 00:00:54.971 position:50% align:center
To be perfectly frank,
I had my doubts at first,

00:00:55.055 --> 00:00:58.016 position:50% align:center
considering how quickly my
brother was able to find you,

00:00:58.099 --> 00:01:00.060 position:50% align:center
but your table manners
are so refined.

00:01:00.143 --> 00:01:01.561 position:50% align:center
I thought this sort
of silverware wasn't

00:01:01.644 --> 00:01:02.896 position:50% align:center
common in Florence.

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:06.149 position:50% align:center
Uh. No, I suppose not.

00:01:06.232 --> 00:01:08.068 position:50% align:center
[YURI] Before we arrive
at my niece's house.

00:01:08.151 --> 00:01:09.861 position:50% align:center
I'll be instructing
you on all facets

00:01:09.944 --> 00:01:11.905 position:50% align:center
of proper Venetian decorum.

[SOFIA]
Katarina.

00:01:22.457 --> 00:01:25.377 position:50% align:center
You mustn't eat pasta with your
hands, it's terribly impolite.

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:26.670 position:50% align:center
Use your fork.

00:01:26.753 --> 00:01:29.255 position:50% align:center
I can't. It's too hard
to keep the bigoli

00:01:29.339 --> 00:01:31.174 position:50% align:center
from falling off of it.

00:01:31.257 --> 00:01:35.136 position:50% align:center
As you see, despite her age,
manners continue to elude her.

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.931 position:50% align:center
You have my permission to
be as strict as necessary.

00:01:38.014 --> 00:01:41.685 position:50% align:center
Just make sure to train her so
she'll be presentable in public.

00:01:41.768 --> 00:01:43.019 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:01:44.187 --> 00:01:45.980 position:50% align:center
[KATARINA grunts]

00:03:16.863 --> 00:03:19.115 position:50% align:center
[yawns] If you're going
to teach me something,

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:20.533 position:50% align:center
would you just do it?

00:03:20.617 --> 00:03:23.161 position:50% align:center
The sooner we finish,
the sooner I can go to sleep.

00:03:23.244 --> 00:03:24.162 position:50% align:center
I'm waiting.

00:03:24.245 --> 00:03:25.789 position:50% align:center
[ARTE groans]

00:03:25.872 --> 00:03:27.123 position:50% align:center
What's wrong?

00:03:27.207 --> 00:03:29.250 position:50% align:center
If you don't have anything
planned, then get out.

00:03:29.334 --> 00:03:32.337 position:50% align:center
Uh! For our first class,
I'd like you to show me

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.423 position:50% align:center
everything you know
about etiquette! Please.

00:03:35.507 --> 00:03:37.592 position:50% align:center
[KATARINA]
Hmph.

00:03:37.676 --> 00:03:39.803 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
Table manners.

00:03:39.886 --> 00:03:41.638 position:50% align:center
Greetings.

00:03:41.721 --> 00:03:44.724 position:50% align:center
Knowledge concerning
social skills.

00:03:44.808 --> 00:03:46.768 position:50% align:center
You passed with flying colors.

00:03:46.851 --> 00:03:48.520 position:50% align:center
Of course. So obviously,

00:03:48.603 --> 00:03:50.730 position:50% align:center
there's nothing left
for you to teach me.

00:03:50.814 --> 00:03:53.525 position:50% align:center
[ARTE] But, the way
you acted yesterday.

00:03:53.608 --> 00:03:56.152 position:50% align:center
What, at the table?
That was fake.

00:03:56.236 --> 00:03:57.654 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:03:57.737 --> 00:03:59.447 position:50% align:center
[KATARINA] Basically, whenever
I'm in front of my mother

00:03:59.531 --> 00:04:02.826 position:50% align:center
and father, I only pretend
to be uncivilized.

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:04.786 position:50% align:center
In reality,
I've completely mastered

00:04:04.869 --> 00:04:07.622 position:50% align:center
the etiquette needed to be seen
as a respectable young lady

00:04:07.706 --> 00:04:08.998 position:50% align:center
when I'm out in public.

00:04:09.082 --> 00:04:11.876 position:50% align:center
I just don't want
my parents to find out.

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.294 position:50% align:center
I don't understand.

00:04:13.378 --> 00:04:15.672 position:50% align:center
[KATARINA] You can't.
Because there's no real reason.

00:04:15.755 --> 00:04:17.257 position:50% align:center
Just that I'm bored.

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.384 position:50% align:center
All those rules? How annoying.

00:04:19.467 --> 00:04:22.345 position:50% align:center
[yawns]
But your class does provide me

00:04:22.429 --> 00:04:23.680 position:50% align:center
the chance to rest up.

00:04:23.763 --> 00:04:26.182 position:50% align:center
Like right now, for instance.

00:04:26.266 --> 00:04:27.934 position:50% align:center
In short...

00:04:28.018 --> 00:04:29.936 position:50% align:center
I'm the one doing you a favor.

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.273 position:50% align:center
If my parents knew the truth,
you wouldn't even have this job.

00:04:33.356 --> 00:04:35.692 position:50% align:center
So just accept your good
fortune and pretend like

00:04:35.775 --> 00:04:37.444 position:50% align:center
you're busy teaching me.

00:04:40.113 --> 00:04:43.033 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
Hmm...

00:04:43.116 --> 00:04:45.577 position:50% align:center
[groans]

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.538 position:50% align:center
I don't know how to get
through to this girl...

00:04:48.621 --> 00:04:51.416 position:50% align:center
Just thinking about it is
hurting my head.

00:04:54.377 --> 00:04:56.129 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
I know her.

00:04:56.212 --> 00:04:57.922 position:50% align:center
--Daphne!
--Huh?

00:04:58.006 --> 00:05:00.425 position:50% align:center
Sorry to bother you!
Hello again!

00:05:00.508 --> 00:05:02.677 position:50% align:center
So, the thing is...

00:05:02.761 --> 00:05:05.096 position:50% align:center
[DAPHNE] It's about
Lady Katarina, isn't it?

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:06.639 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:05:06.723 --> 00:05:08.850 position:50% align:center
You realize this
isn't something new.

00:05:08.933 --> 00:05:11.811 position:50% align:center
You mean, she was like this
with her previous tutors?

00:05:11.895 --> 00:05:15.398 position:50% align:center
Indeed. Sooner or later, they
all grew tired of her attitude.

00:05:15.482 --> 00:05:18.735 position:50% align:center
One would quit, and be replaced
with another not long after.

00:05:18.818 --> 00:05:22.697 position:50% align:center
Her routine's consistent: ignore
the teacher, then fall asleep.

00:05:22.781 --> 00:05:25.700 position:50% align:center
[ARTE] Are Lady Sofia
and Lord Malta aware?

00:05:25.784 --> 00:05:27.243 position:50% align:center
[DAPHNE]
No. For the most part,

00:05:27.327 --> 00:05:29.996 position:50% align:center
Lady Katarina is an angel
in front of her parents

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.581 position:50% align:center
and any visitors we may have.

00:05:31.664 --> 00:05:34.209 position:50% align:center
As for us servants,
even though we know the truth,

00:05:34.292 --> 00:05:35.752 position:50% align:center
we don't want to
cause any trouble.

00:05:35.835 --> 00:05:39.297 position:50% align:center
That's why. No wonder they can't
find a teacher who'll stay.

00:05:41.299 --> 00:05:44.511 position:50% align:center
[ARTE] These are the options for
the layout of your portrait.

00:05:44.594 --> 00:05:46.805 position:50% align:center
Let me see.

00:05:46.888 --> 00:05:51.101 position:50% align:center
These are all sublime.
I can't decide on one.

00:05:51.184 --> 00:05:52.477 position:50% align:center
Pardon, but...

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.647 position:50% align:center
How is Katarina?
Are her lessons going well?

00:05:55.730 --> 00:06:00.235 position:50% align:center
[ARTE] Uh. Well, um,
it's too early to tell.

00:06:00.318 --> 00:06:02.946 position:50% align:center
We've tried finding
the right person for the job,

00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:05.740 position:50% align:center
but no one ever
stays for very long.

00:06:05.824 --> 00:06:09.160 position:50% align:center
Arte, if Yuri thinks you'll be
able to reach my daughter,

00:06:09.244 --> 00:06:13.123 position:50% align:center
then you have my confidence.
Please, just do your best.

00:06:13.206 --> 00:06:14.833 position:50% align:center
[ARTE groans]

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:19.629 position:50% align:center
[ARTE sighs]
What's my plan?

00:06:19.713 --> 00:06:22.215 position:50% align:center
Katarina always sleeps
through all her lessons,

00:06:22.298 --> 00:06:23.925 position:50% align:center
and no matter who I ask,
I can't get any

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:27.012 position:50% align:center
useful information from them.

00:06:27.095 --> 00:06:28.430 position:50% align:center
[groans]

00:06:31.933 --> 00:06:34.144 position:50% align:center
[ARTE] It's strange how the
air in Venice is so different

00:06:34.227 --> 00:06:35.937 position:50% align:center
from back home.

00:06:36.021 --> 00:06:40.233 position:50% align:center
It has a sort of briskness to
it, and smells like the ocean.

00:06:40.316 --> 00:06:42.736 position:50% align:center
There's no shortage of portrait
artists I could choose from

00:06:42.819 --> 00:06:45.739 position:50% align:center
in Venice. Ultimately,
I decided on you,

00:06:45.822 --> 00:06:48.074 position:50% align:center
because I felt that you would
make the most effective

00:06:48.158 --> 00:06:49.868 position:50% align:center
teacher for my niece.

00:06:49.951 --> 00:06:53.747 position:50% align:center
I was hired, not for
my skills as an artist,

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:55.582 position:50% align:center
but only because Yuri
thought I would make a good

00:06:55.665 --> 00:06:58.001 position:50% align:center
tutor for Katarina.

00:06:58.084 --> 00:06:59.586 position:50% align:center
At this rate...

00:06:59.669 --> 00:07:02.756 position:50% align:center
...I'll end up returning home
without doing anything useful.

00:07:04.799 --> 00:07:07.927 position:50% align:center
If that happens, how am I
supposed to face Leo?

00:07:08.011 --> 00:07:09.512 position:50% align:center
[grunts]
My stomach!

00:07:09.596 --> 00:07:11.765 position:50% align:center
The thought of him mad
makes me want to puke.

00:07:11.848 --> 00:07:12.974 position:50% align:center
I should really just go to bed

00:07:13.058 --> 00:07:14.434 position:50% align:center
and stop overthinking
everything.

00:07:14.517 --> 00:07:16.895 position:50% align:center
But good luck with that, me.

00:07:16.978 --> 00:07:19.981 position:50% align:center
Huh? Isn't that Katarina's room?

00:07:23.151 --> 00:07:25.820 position:50% align:center
[ARTE] I thought I saw a light
coming from her window,

00:07:25.904 --> 00:07:28.239 position:50% align:center
but why would she
be up at this hour?

00:07:32.952 --> 00:07:36.373 position:50% align:center
[DAPHNE] Huh? Directions
to a nearby church? Really?

00:07:36.456 --> 00:07:37.749 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
Yeah!

00:07:37.832 --> 00:07:39.376 position:50% align:center
Since there's nothing scheduled
this morning anyway.

00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:41.461 position:50% align:center
I thought I'd go
and see some art!

00:07:41.544 --> 00:07:42.629 position:50% align:center
[DAPHNE]
I know one.

00:07:42.712 --> 00:07:44.756 position:50% align:center
Let me write down
the directions for you.

00:07:45.799 --> 00:07:48.802 position:50% align:center
When it comes to your trade, you
painters are a studious bunch.

00:07:48.885 --> 00:07:50.637 position:50% align:center
Huh? Well, that's part of it.

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:53.473 position:50% align:center
But to be honest, I've been
going a bit stir crazy.

00:07:53.556 --> 00:07:55.392 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:07:55.475 --> 00:07:57.435 position:50% align:center
On second thought, allow me
to show you the way

00:07:57.519 --> 00:07:58.645 position:50% align:center
to the church myself.

00:07:58.728 --> 00:08:00.271 position:50% align:center
Ah. I'll be fine.

00:08:00.355 --> 00:08:02.774 position:50% align:center
I would feel bad
interrupting your work.

00:08:02.857 --> 00:08:06.027 position:50% align:center
Venice has many alleys and
it's easy to get lost in them.

00:08:06.111 --> 00:08:08.613 position:50% align:center
Please wait here a moment
while I get permission.

00:08:08.697 --> 00:08:11.199 position:50% align:center
Uh... Well, if you insist.

00:08:11.282 --> 00:08:16.162 position:50% align:center

00:08:22.961 --> 00:08:25.005 position:50% align:center
Thank you for
showing me this place.

00:08:25.088 --> 00:08:27.674 position:50% align:center
I'll see you back at the house
when I'm done sketching?

00:08:27.757 --> 00:08:28.883 position:50% align:center
There's no rush.

00:08:28.967 --> 00:08:30.802 position:50% align:center
I'll wait here until
you're finished.

00:08:30.885 --> 00:08:32.178 position:50% align:center
Eh?

00:08:36.391 --> 00:08:38.768 position:50% align:center
[MAN 09A]
Hmm? Hey, you're pretty good.

00:08:38.852 --> 00:08:41.896 position:50% align:center
Oh, well actually, I belong
to a workshop in Florence.

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:44.232 position:50% align:center
[MAN 09B]
A girl? In a workshop?

00:08:44.315 --> 00:08:46.776 position:50% align:center
Is Florence experiencing such
a shortage of men these days,

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:49.154 position:50% align:center
they're letting
women become artists?

00:08:49.237 --> 00:08:51.406 position:50% align:center
I guess the "flowering
capital" has withered.

00:08:51.489 --> 00:08:52.741 position:50% align:center
A female painter!

00:08:52.824 --> 00:08:55.076 position:50% align:center
Hey! That's enough,
the both of you!

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:57.078 position:50% align:center
[MAN 09A]
Hmph!

00:08:57.162 --> 00:08:58.538 position:50% align:center
They had no right!

00:09:07.714 --> 00:09:10.884 position:50% align:center
[laughing continues]

00:09:10.967 --> 00:09:11.885 position:50% align:center
You're laughing?

00:09:11.968 --> 00:09:13.345 position:50% align:center
How can I not?

00:09:13.428 --> 00:09:17.015 position:50% align:center
No matter how far you travel,
men always act the same.

00:09:17.098 --> 00:09:20.310 position:50% align:center
Wow. I think this Venetian air
is getting to me or something.

00:09:20.393 --> 00:09:21.436 position:50% align:center
Sorry.

00:09:21.519 --> 00:09:23.730 position:50% align:center
This city kind of
reminds of Florence.

00:09:23.813 --> 00:09:25.982 position:50% align:center
Some parts of it
are very similar.

00:09:26.066 --> 00:09:28.485 position:50% align:center
Even though I have
a slightly different job now,

00:09:28.568 --> 00:09:30.403 position:50% align:center
and the people
around me are new,

00:09:30.487 --> 00:09:32.655 position:50% align:center
there's lots that's
still the same.

00:09:32.739 --> 00:09:35.617 position:50% align:center
For instance,
I haven't really changed.

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:38.495 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry?
You're sure you're fine?

00:09:38.578 --> 00:09:39.954 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
Hmm? I promise!

00:09:40.038 --> 00:09:42.040 position:50% align:center
Besides, I'm used to it by now.

00:09:42.123 --> 00:09:44.417 position:50% align:center
I can't let naysayers
get me down.

00:09:44.501 --> 00:09:46.002 position:50% align:center
You're used to it?

00:09:46.086 --> 00:09:47.796 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
Mm. I have to be.

00:09:47.879 --> 00:09:50.715 position:50% align:center
I can't change other people,
so all I can do is my best,

00:09:50.799 --> 00:09:52.592 position:50% align:center
just like always.

00:09:56.137 --> 00:09:58.056 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
So, anyway, Katarina.

00:09:58.139 --> 00:10:00.975 position:50% align:center
Could you tell me more about
what you said the other day?

00:10:01.059 --> 00:10:03.770 position:50% align:center
Why you won't use
etiquette in public?

00:10:03.853 --> 00:10:05.188 position:50% align:center
You tell me something.

00:10:05.271 --> 00:10:06.272 position:50% align:center
Your clothes.

00:10:06.356 --> 00:10:07.899 position:50% align:center
What kind of outfit
are you wearing?

00:10:07.982 --> 00:10:11.403 position:50% align:center
Huh? [laughs] Oh, this is
what I typically put on

00:10:11.486 --> 00:10:12.904 position:50% align:center
when I'm working, actually.

00:10:12.987 --> 00:10:15.156 position:50% align:center
Sorry if it's a little dirty.

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:17.909 position:50% align:center
I wear it because
it's easy to move in!

00:10:17.992 --> 00:10:19.703 position:50% align:center
Well, dress however you want,

00:10:19.786 --> 00:10:21.913 position:50% align:center
it doesn't make
any difference to me.

00:10:21.996 --> 00:10:23.415 position:50% align:center
But in return...

00:10:23.498 --> 00:10:26.126 position:50% align:center
Try not to disturb me while
I sleep through your lesson.

00:10:28.294 --> 00:10:29.504 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:10:30.839 --> 00:10:32.382 position:50% align:center
Uh! Uh?!

00:10:32.465 --> 00:10:34.509 position:50% align:center
See? Much easier
to move around in!

00:10:34.592 --> 00:10:36.845 position:50% align:center
Especially for
lifting little girls!

00:10:36.928 --> 00:10:38.471 position:50% align:center
Now that you're wide awake.

00:10:38.555 --> 00:10:41.725 position:50% align:center
We should have plenty of time
to practice politely conversing.

00:10:41.808 --> 00:10:44.144 position:50% align:center
--Why don't you start?
--[KATARINA whimpering]

00:10:45.937 --> 00:10:48.398 position:50% align:center
[ARTE] I was forced to
use extreme measures.

00:10:48.481 --> 00:10:49.691 position:50% align:center
[DAPHNE]
And?

00:10:49.774 --> 00:10:52.235 position:50% align:center
Were you able to get
Lady Katarina to open up?

00:10:52.318 --> 00:10:54.821 position:50% align:center
Sadly, she refused
to talk to me.

00:10:54.904 --> 00:10:57.240 position:50% align:center
But at least I was able
to keep her from snoozing!

00:10:57.323 --> 00:10:59.617 position:50% align:center
And I don't mean to brag,
but I built up a lot of muscle

00:10:59.701 --> 00:11:00.785 position:50% align:center
at the workshop!

00:11:00.869 --> 00:11:02.871 position:50% align:center
I can lift a little girl
like her all day!

00:11:02.954 --> 00:11:06.124 position:50% align:center
So her habit of sleeping
through classes is finita!

00:11:06.207 --> 00:11:08.668 position:50% align:center
Because it doesn't matter if
she knows how to behave,

00:11:08.752 --> 00:11:11.004 position:50% align:center
or if she already has
perfect etiquette skills.

00:11:11.087 --> 00:11:13.465 position:50% align:center
She refuses to share them,
and that's just the same

00:11:13.548 --> 00:11:15.216 position:50% align:center
as not having them at all.

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:18.219 position:50% align:center
As her tutor, it's my job
to figure out what's wrong.

00:11:18.303 --> 00:11:22.182 position:50% align:center
But the good news is...
it looks like I have an ally.

00:11:22.265 --> 00:11:25.393 position:50% align:center
Ally? Now, I wouldn't
go that far.

00:11:25.477 --> 00:11:29.272 position:50% align:center
You asked for help
and I'm doing my job.

00:11:29.356 --> 00:11:31.691 position:50% align:center
Here's some old cloth
that was being thrown away.

00:11:31.775 --> 00:11:33.568 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
Ah! Thank you so much!

00:11:33.651 --> 00:11:35.320 position:50% align:center
What exactly are
your plans for it?

00:11:35.403 --> 00:11:37.113 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]
You'll find out!

00:11:37.197 --> 00:11:38.406 position:50% align:center
I'll start on it tonight!

00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:40.533 position:50% align:center
But-- [coughs]

00:11:40.617 --> 00:11:42.160 position:50% align:center
First, it needs dusting!

00:11:42.243 --> 00:11:43.661 position:50% align:center
[DAPHNE chuckles]

00:11:43.745 --> 00:11:46.331 position:50% align:center
[ARTE] Relax. You don't
have to be so on guard.

00:11:46.414 --> 00:11:48.458 position:50% align:center
[KATARINA] After the way you
were acting a few days ago,

00:11:48.541 --> 00:11:49.876 position:50% align:center
can you blame me?

00:11:49.959 --> 00:11:51.961 position:50% align:center
I've got something you'll
like planned for us today.

00:11:52.045 --> 00:11:53.755 position:50% align:center
--[KATARINA] Hmm?
--For our lesson,

00:11:53.838 --> 00:11:55.298 position:50% align:center
I want you to change
into this dress--

00:11:55.382 --> 00:11:57.092 position:50% align:center
which took me three nights
to make by the way--

00:11:57.175 --> 00:11:58.718 position:50% align:center
and then we're going outdoors!

00:11:58.802 --> 00:12:01.054 position:50% align:center
We're going to have
fun and be best friends!

00:12:01.137 --> 00:12:03.973 position:50% align:center
Friends? You're joking.

00:12:04.057 --> 00:12:06.101 position:50% align:center
[ARTE] Not many people
use this courtyard,

00:12:06.184 --> 00:12:08.853 position:50% align:center
which makes it the
ideal spot for class!

00:12:08.937 --> 00:12:10.230 position:50% align:center
I was worried about the size,

00:12:10.313 --> 00:12:12.649 position:50% align:center
but I'm glad the dress fits!

00:12:12.732 --> 00:12:15.110 position:50% align:center
Now you don't have to
worry about getting dirty!

00:12:15.193 --> 00:12:18.446 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I don't really
care about that.

00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:20.824 position:50% align:center
I'm just confused
what the point of this is.

00:12:20.907 --> 00:12:23.868 position:50% align:center
Huh? Hold that thought.

00:12:23.952 --> 00:12:27.122 position:50% align:center
Just a little bit more!

00:12:27.205 --> 00:12:28.665 position:50% align:center
And there!

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:32.252 position:50% align:center
Eh?

00:12:32.335 --> 00:12:35.797 position:50% align:center
We have everything
we need for hoop rolling!

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:37.507 position:50% align:center
Why's it not going
where I want it?

00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:39.300 position:50% align:center
C'mon, heel!

00:12:39.384 --> 00:12:43.555 position:50% align:center
This is harder than I thought.
It takes some getting used to.

00:12:47.017 --> 00:12:49.936 position:50% align:center
[ARTE] Wow, Katarina!
You're pretty good at this!

00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:51.479 position:50% align:center
Yeah, of course!

00:12:51.563 --> 00:12:54.315 position:50% align:center
I used to do this all the time
before I came to live here.

00:12:54.399 --> 00:12:55.358 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
Huh?

00:12:55.442 --> 00:12:57.027 position:50% align:center
I'm winning!

00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:59.904 position:50% align:center
If you can't keep up,
I'm going to leave you behind!

00:12:59.988 --> 00:13:02.282 position:50% align:center
Hold on! I'm learning here!

00:13:04.034 --> 00:13:07.287 position:50% align:center
[ARTE sighs]
So exhausted.

00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:10.331 position:50% align:center
What's the big idea making
your tutor run the entire way?

00:13:10.415 --> 00:13:12.250 position:50% align:center
You could've waited
for me to catch up.

00:13:12.334 --> 00:13:14.336 position:50% align:center
That would've defeated
the whole purpose.

00:13:14.419 --> 00:13:15.962 position:50% align:center
You and I were competing.

00:13:16.046 --> 00:13:19.132 position:50% align:center
After all that exercise,
I sure could use a hearty meal.

00:13:19.215 --> 00:13:21.593 position:50% align:center
That dinner my first night
was delicious.

00:13:21.676 --> 00:13:24.554 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't mind having
that veal stew again.

00:13:24.637 --> 00:13:26.389 position:50% align:center
[KATARINA]
I know the one you mean.

00:13:26.473 --> 00:13:29.476 position:50% align:center
In addition to the raisins, the
meal is flavored with ginger,

00:13:29.559 --> 00:13:31.353 position:50% align:center
cinnamon, and black pepper.

00:13:31.436 --> 00:13:33.980 position:50% align:center
And did you pick up on
the vinegar in the red wine?

00:13:34.064 --> 00:13:37.317 position:50% align:center
I'm impressed. You sure know
a lot about that dish.

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:39.486 position:50% align:center
Have you been
talking to the cook?

00:13:39.569 --> 00:13:41.404 position:50% align:center
Oh, uh... Yes! The cook.

00:13:41.488 --> 00:13:45.033 position:50% align:center
I see. By the way, Katarina...

00:13:45.116 --> 00:13:47.660 position:50% align:center
Could you talk to
me properly now?

00:13:47.744 --> 00:13:49.120 position:50% align:center
Since we've...

00:13:49.204 --> 00:13:51.247 position:50% align:center
Since we were having fun,
and you just had to spoil it

00:13:51.331 --> 00:13:53.416 position:50% align:center
by making this
about my etiquette.

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:55.085 position:50% align:center
I'm headed back.

00:13:55.168 --> 00:13:57.295 position:50% align:center
[yawns]
Can't get worn out.

00:13:57.379 --> 00:13:58.755 position:50% align:center
Otherwise,
I'll fall asleep tonight

00:13:58.838 --> 00:14:01.508 position:50% align:center
before I get any further.

00:14:01.591 --> 00:14:02.509 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
Huh?

00:14:02.592 --> 00:14:04.135 position:50% align:center
Just forget what I said.

00:14:04.219 --> 00:14:07.180 position:50% align:center
We'll play again later,
Professoressa.

00:14:07.263 --> 00:14:08.848 position:50% align:center
Katarina, wait.

00:14:13.061 --> 00:14:13.978 position:50% align:center
Arte.

00:14:14.062 --> 00:14:15.563 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
Ma'am?

00:14:15.647 --> 00:14:17.691 position:50% align:center
Have you and my daughter made
progress since last I checked?

00:14:17.774 --> 00:14:20.193 position:50% align:center
What? Well, she's, uh...

00:14:20.276 --> 00:14:23.738 position:50% align:center
She's great!
Everything's great, Lady Sofia!

00:14:23.822 --> 00:14:26.449 position:50% align:center
There's no need to try
and spare my feelings.

00:14:26.533 --> 00:14:29.369 position:50% align:center
No matter who we've hired for
this, it hasn't worked out yet,

00:14:29.452 --> 00:14:33.039 position:50% align:center
so I know better than to
expect any positive results.

00:14:33.123 --> 00:14:34.499 position:50% align:center
That poor girl.

00:14:34.582 --> 00:14:36.668 position:50% align:center
I feel like I just can't
understand what goes on

00:14:36.751 --> 00:14:38.503 position:50% align:center
in that heart of hers.

00:14:38.586 --> 00:14:39.838 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
Uh...

00:14:39.921 --> 00:14:42.132 position:50% align:center
You see, my daughter
is not an only child.

00:14:42.215 --> 00:14:45.510 position:50% align:center
She has two brothers, as well,
and right after each of them

00:14:45.593 --> 00:14:48.263 position:50% align:center
were born, the children all were
sent away to be brought up at

00:14:48.346 --> 00:14:49.639 position:50% align:center
our family's villa.

00:14:49.723 --> 00:14:51.558 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
And that includes Katarina.

00:14:51.641 --> 00:14:54.060 position:50% align:center
[SOFIA] Yes. Normally, they
would have been sent home

00:14:54.144 --> 00:14:57.063 position:50% align:center
after a couple of years,
but it took longer for her

00:14:57.147 --> 00:14:58.690 position:50% align:center
to be returned.

00:14:58.773 --> 00:15:01.860 position:50% align:center
[SOFIA] Malta, my husband,
wasn't interested in children

00:15:01.943 --> 00:15:04.029 position:50% align:center
unless they were sons.

00:15:04.112 --> 00:15:06.364 position:50% align:center
One day, that girl will
have to be married off,

00:15:06.448 --> 00:15:08.700 position:50% align:center
and it'll cost us a fortune.

00:15:08.783 --> 00:15:11.745 position:50% align:center
[SOFIA] Katarina only came back
to live with us recently.

00:15:11.828 --> 00:15:14.122 position:50% align:center
And by then,
she was already six.

00:15:14.205 --> 00:15:15.999 position:50% align:center
Per my husband's instructions,

00:15:16.082 --> 00:15:18.501 position:50% align:center
we've brought in countless
tutors to give her continuous

00:15:18.585 --> 00:15:21.713 position:50% align:center
lessons on culture and manners,
so as to avoid embarrassing

00:15:21.796 --> 00:15:23.214 position:50% align:center
the family name.

00:15:23.298 --> 00:15:26.051 position:50% align:center
That's why I feel like my
daughter has closed herself off,

00:15:26.134 --> 00:15:29.179 position:50% align:center
and refuses to open up
to anyone in this house.

00:15:30.805 --> 00:15:32.724 position:50% align:center
[ARTE] I wonder if there's
a connection between her

00:15:32.807 --> 00:15:35.894 position:50% align:center
living away from home at
the villa for all those years,

00:15:35.977 --> 00:15:39.564 position:50% align:center
and pretending not to
understand etiquette.

00:15:39.647 --> 00:15:41.399 position:50% align:center
Also...

00:15:42.984 --> 00:15:44.652 position:50% align:center
[ARTE] Why does she try
to get all of her sleep

00:15:44.736 --> 00:15:46.237 position:50% align:center
during the daytime?

00:15:52.494 --> 00:15:54.496 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
That's Katarina's room.

00:15:54.579 --> 00:15:56.331 position:50% align:center
Come to think of it,
I saw a light in the window

00:15:56.414 --> 00:15:57.957 position:50% align:center
the other night.

00:15:59.918 --> 00:16:01.461 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
Um, it's me.

00:16:01.544 --> 00:16:03.171 position:50% align:center
Are you still awake?

00:16:03.254 --> 00:16:05.423 position:50% align:center
I'd like to talk if you're up.

00:16:09.219 --> 00:16:11.054 position:50% align:center
--[crashing]
--[KATARINA screams]

00:16:11.137 --> 00:16:13.098 position:50% align:center
What was that? Are you hurt?

00:16:13.181 --> 00:16:16.768 position:50% align:center
Answer me! I'm coming in!

00:16:16.851 --> 00:16:18.269 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:18.353 --> 00:16:19.979 position:50% align:center
[KATARINA]
Uh...

00:16:23.066 --> 00:16:25.610 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
These are books about cooking.

00:16:25.694 --> 00:16:27.987 position:50% align:center
You're studying culinary arts?

00:16:28.071 --> 00:16:31.074 position:50% align:center
[KATARINA growls]
Why are you in my room?

00:16:31.157 --> 00:16:34.369 position:50% align:center
I just wanted to know why you
were so unmotivated in my class.

00:16:34.452 --> 00:16:35.662 position:50% align:center
With etiquette.

00:16:35.745 --> 00:16:37.330 position:50% align:center
How to help.

00:16:37.414 --> 00:16:42.544 position:50% align:center
And? Now that you've discovered
my secret, are you satisfied?

00:16:42.627 --> 00:16:44.087 position:50% align:center
That's not what I came here to--

00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:45.964 position:50% align:center
Do you think I care?!

00:16:46.047 --> 00:16:48.425 position:50% align:center
For the record, the reason I
don't want to act like a noble

00:16:48.508 --> 00:16:51.136 position:50% align:center
in public--it has nothing to
do with me wanting to learn

00:16:51.219 --> 00:16:52.595 position:50% align:center
how to cook!

00:16:52.679 --> 00:16:56.057 position:50% align:center
So go ahead. Report this
to Mother and Father.

00:16:56.141 --> 00:16:58.393 position:50% align:center
They'll tell me how preparing
food is a job fit only

00:16:58.476 --> 00:17:00.562 position:50% align:center
for peasants and servants.

00:17:00.645 --> 00:17:02.814 position:50% align:center
Then, Father will forbid me
from ever setting foot

00:17:02.897 --> 00:17:05.150 position:50% align:center
in a kitchen or cooking again.

00:17:05.233 --> 00:17:08.361 position:50% align:center
But won't they be shocked when
they find out that punishing me

00:17:08.445 --> 00:17:11.614 position:50% align:center
won't suddenly turn me into
a well-behaved young lady?!

00:17:11.698 --> 00:17:15.076 position:50% align:center
Katarina. I promise you.
I never meant to--

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:16.494 position:50% align:center
Go away.

00:17:21.124 --> 00:17:22.709 position:50% align:center
My apologies.

00:17:28.923 --> 00:17:31.384 position:50% align:center
What a mess. Now what?

00:17:33.887 --> 00:17:36.556 position:50% align:center
[KATARINA] First, we place one
whole capon into a pot of

00:17:36.639 --> 00:17:39.976 position:50% align:center
hot water, then add in
the carrots, onions,

00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:42.896 position:50% align:center
celery root,
parsley, and garlic.

00:17:42.979 --> 00:17:45.815 position:50% align:center
Skim the film off
the surface as it boils.

00:17:45.899 --> 00:17:49.027 position:50% align:center
Eventually, you'll be left
with a golden brodo.

00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:52.906 position:50% align:center
Next, you roll lasagna
made from high-quality flour.

00:17:52.989 --> 00:17:55.492 position:50% align:center
After it's cooked, put it on
a plate and sprinkle

00:17:55.575 --> 00:17:56.993 position:50% align:center
with grated cheese.

00:17:57.077 --> 00:17:59.913 position:50% align:center
Layer and repeat several times.

00:17:59.996 --> 00:18:01.289 position:50% align:center
Then...

00:18:03.249 --> 00:18:06.336 position:50% align:center
The brodo and the cheese lend it
the perfect amount of saltiness!

00:18:06.419 --> 00:18:08.254 position:50% align:center
There's no time
to sneak in a taste!

00:18:08.338 --> 00:18:10.382 position:50% align:center
You haven't finished
putting the cheese on yet!

00:18:10.465 --> 00:18:12.258 position:50% align:center
Hurry, before it
gets cold, Uncle!

00:18:12.342 --> 00:18:14.511 position:50% align:center
Heh. Right away.

00:18:14.594 --> 00:18:16.930 position:50% align:center
So, how are things going
with your new teacher?

00:18:17.013 --> 00:18:19.349 position:50% align:center
Are you getting along?

00:18:19.432 --> 00:18:22.018 position:50% align:center
She's more interesting
than my previous tutors,

00:18:22.102 --> 00:18:24.187 position:50% align:center
but after today...

00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:27.482 position:50% align:center
...I don't think I'll be able
to cook over here anymore.

00:18:27.565 --> 00:18:28.525 position:50% align:center
[YURI]
Hmm?

00:18:28.608 --> 00:18:30.652 position:50% align:center
Nothing.

00:18:30.735 --> 00:18:31.778 position:50% align:center
Come on.

00:18:31.861 --> 00:18:33.655 position:50% align:center
Let's go eat this with everyone.

00:18:37.409 --> 00:18:39.202 position:50% align:center
They're waiting for me?

00:18:46.292 --> 00:18:47.711 position:50% align:center
--[MALTA] What's wrong?
--[KATARINA whimpers]

00:18:47.794 --> 00:18:50.505 position:50% align:center
Can't even say goodbye to your
father as he's headed out?

00:18:50.588 --> 00:18:52.048 position:50% align:center
Ah?

00:18:52.132 --> 00:18:54.801 position:50% align:center
Hurry up, dear.
You have a lesson now.

00:18:54.884 --> 00:18:57.679 position:50% align:center
Don't keep Arte waiting.

00:18:57.762 --> 00:19:02.142 position:50% align:center
[KATARINA] That's it? It's
almost like they don't know.

00:19:02.225 --> 00:19:05.395 position:50% align:center
All right, Katarina, are you
ready to start class now?

00:19:06.396 --> 00:19:09.274 position:50% align:center
Why didn't you tell my parents
about what you saw in my room?!

00:19:09.357 --> 00:19:11.401 position:50% align:center
Well, it wasn't my business.

00:19:11.484 --> 00:19:12.736 position:50% align:center
Meaning what?

00:19:12.819 --> 00:19:15.363 position:50% align:center
I was hired to paint
portraits and be your tutor.

00:19:15.447 --> 00:19:16.906 position:50% align:center
Not to upend your life.

00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:18.783 position:50% align:center
Believe me, I know how
much it hurts to have

00:19:18.867 --> 00:19:21.286 position:50% align:center
what you love taken away.

00:19:21.369 --> 00:19:22.412 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:22.495 --> 00:19:23.830 position:50% align:center
Before I left to
become an apprentice,

00:19:23.913 --> 00:19:26.458 position:50% align:center
my mother gathered my
drawings and burned them.

00:19:26.541 --> 00:19:28.126 position:50% align:center
Though, I guess you could
say she only managed

00:19:28.209 --> 00:19:30.378 position:50% align:center
to fuel my fire more.

00:19:30.462 --> 00:19:31.713 position:50% align:center
What?

00:19:31.796 --> 00:19:34.257 position:50% align:center
Yeah, come to think of it,
a lot of the reason why

00:19:34.341 --> 00:19:36.509 position:50% align:center
I went into art in the first
place is probably because

00:19:36.593 --> 00:19:38.470 position:50% align:center
I can't take no for an answer.

00:19:38.553 --> 00:19:40.013 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:19:40.096 --> 00:19:42.474 position:50% align:center
[KATARINA] So much was
standing in your way.

00:19:42.557 --> 00:19:44.934 position:50% align:center
And you didn't give up?

00:19:45.018 --> 00:19:47.604 position:50% align:center
Never. But proving I could
wasn't the only reason

00:19:47.687 --> 00:19:49.314 position:50% align:center
I became a painter.

00:19:49.397 --> 00:19:51.024 position:50% align:center
Hmm.

00:19:51.107 --> 00:19:53.068 position:50% align:center
Would you care to
see my drawings?

00:19:56.279 --> 00:19:57.655 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow.

00:19:57.739 --> 00:19:59.741 position:50% align:center
When you walk around, do you
sketch everything you see?

00:19:59.824 --> 00:20:01.284 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
As much as I can.

00:20:01.368 --> 00:20:04.746 position:50% align:center
It helps to document people,
places, and things I encounter.

00:20:04.829 --> 00:20:07.832 position:50% align:center
Especially when it comes time
to make a painting for work.

00:20:07.916 --> 00:20:10.710 position:50% align:center
Since everything can
be used for reference later.

00:20:10.794 --> 00:20:13.213 position:50% align:center
To a painter, this is gold.

00:20:13.296 --> 00:20:17.342 position:50% align:center
[KATARINA] Ohh... Did you
really use to be a noble?

00:20:17.425 --> 00:20:20.011 position:50% align:center
A poor one.
I'm my family's only daughter.

00:20:20.095 --> 00:20:23.515 position:50% align:center
We could barely manage to
save enough for one dowry.

00:20:23.598 --> 00:20:25.975 position:50% align:center
Wasn't it hard changing
the way you lived?

00:20:26.059 --> 00:20:27.769 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
Let me think...

00:20:27.852 --> 00:20:29.688 position:50% align:center
Hmm...

00:20:29.771 --> 00:20:31.648 position:50% align:center
Nights were difficult.

00:20:31.731 --> 00:20:32.649 position:50% align:center
They were?

00:20:32.732 --> 00:20:34.275 position:50% align:center
Yes. I was so exhausted,

00:20:34.359 --> 00:20:37.112 position:50% align:center
it was hard to focus or
keep my eyes from closing.

00:20:37.195 --> 00:20:39.155 position:50% align:center
Also, the job is
surprisingly physical,

00:20:39.239 --> 00:20:40.615 position:50% align:center
and we have to work
quickly to make sure

00:20:40.699 --> 00:20:41.991 position:50% align:center
we meet our deadlines.

00:20:42.075 --> 00:20:44.327 position:50% align:center
So I'm always covered
in cuts and bruises--

00:20:44.411 --> 00:20:48.331 position:50% align:center
Ah! Not to say there
isn't plenty to love!

00:20:48.415 --> 00:20:50.625 position:50% align:center
I ended up becoming friends
with a baker and got to hear

00:20:50.709 --> 00:20:53.211 position:50% align:center
stories from him. Not to
mention all the food I bought

00:20:53.294 --> 00:20:56.089 position:50% align:center
from the marketplace
to eat during breaks.

00:20:56.172 --> 00:20:58.049 position:50% align:center
And on my days off,
sometimes I'll play games with

00:20:58.133 --> 00:21:01.011 position:50% align:center
the other apprentices,
which is lots of fun!

00:21:01.094 --> 00:21:03.972 position:50% align:center
There is hard work involved,
but it's worth it!

00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:08.977 position:50% align:center
I'm sure.

00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:10.228 position:50% align:center
HuH?

00:21:10.311 --> 00:21:12.188 position:50% align:center
[KATARINA] You said your
name was Arte, right?

00:21:12.272 --> 00:21:13.898 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Yes! That's right!

00:21:13.982 --> 00:21:15.442 position:50% align:center
You remembered!

00:21:15.525 --> 00:21:17.027 position:50% align:center
I don't think I've heard you
say it once since I got here,

00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:19.070 position:50% align:center
so I was convinced that you'd
forgotten it completely,

00:21:19.154 --> 00:21:21.239 position:50% align:center
but I guess I was wrong,
what a relief!

00:21:21.322 --> 00:21:23.783 position:50% align:center
[KATARINA] Let me guess. People
have called you strange before?

00:21:23.867 --> 00:21:24.784 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
Ugh!

00:21:24.868 --> 00:21:27.412 position:50% align:center
Well? Has anyone said that?

00:21:27.495 --> 00:21:31.458 position:50% align:center
Lots. Too many too count...

00:21:31.541 --> 00:21:33.460 position:50% align:center
[laughs]
It figures!

00:21:33.543 --> 00:21:35.920 position:50% align:center
As soon as I heard Uncle Yuri
was bringing you.

00:21:36.004 --> 00:21:38.048 position:50% align:center
I knew right away you
couldn't be normal!

00:21:38.131 --> 00:21:39.341 position:50% align:center
[ARTE groans]

00:21:39.424 --> 00:21:41.092 position:50% align:center
[KATARINA giggles]
I didn't think so at first,

00:21:41.176 --> 00:21:43.219 position:50% align:center
--but you're interesting.
--[ARTE] Huh?

00:21:43.303 --> 00:21:45.138 position:50% align:center
I'd like to see your other
drawings if you don't mind

00:21:45.221 --> 00:21:47.265 position:50% align:center
showing them to me sometime.

00:21:47.349 --> 00:21:48.600 position:50% align:center
[ARTE gasps]

00:21:51.311 --> 00:21:53.188 position:50% align:center
What is it?

00:21:53.271 --> 00:21:57.525 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry. For entering
your room without permission,

00:21:57.609 --> 00:22:00.070 position:50% align:center
and pushing you
to open up to me.

00:22:00.153 --> 00:22:02.405 position:50% align:center
I wanted to know
what was in your heart.

00:22:02.489 --> 00:22:04.074 position:50% align:center
Who you were.

00:22:04.157 --> 00:22:06.034 position:50% align:center
I won't ask anymore.

00:22:06.117 --> 00:22:08.203 position:50% align:center
Whether or not you let me
into your life should be

00:22:08.286 --> 00:22:10.080 position:50% align:center
your decision to make.

00:22:12.707 --> 00:22:16.419 position:50% align:center
Arte, do you want to have
dinner with us tonight?

00:22:16.503 --> 00:22:17.629 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:22:17.712 --> 00:22:20.382 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't mind
telling you more there.

00:22:20.465 --> 00:22:22.801 position:50% align:center
About myself.

00:22:22.884 --> 00:22:25.053 position:50% align:center
I can tell you everything.

00:23:56.853 --> 00:23:58.188 position:50% align:center
[ARTE] Your past is
more complicated than

00:23:58.271 --> 00:23:59.939 position:50% align:center
I could've imagined, Katarina.

00:24:00.023 --> 00:24:02.442 position:50% align:center
[KATARINA] I didn't have a
straightforward life like yours.

00:24:02.525 --> 00:24:03.735 position:50% align:center
[ARTE] Then I'll do
my best to understand

00:24:03.818 --> 00:24:05.695 position:50% align:center
what you can't put into words!

00:24:05.779 --> 00:24:07.530 position:50% align:center
Next time:
"Katarina's Dinner."

00:24:07.614 --> 00:24:10.492 position:50% align:center
Delicious food tenderizes
the heart! Wait...
