[NARRATOR] Florence, the
beginning of the 16th century.

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.954 position:50% align:center
During this time, the majority
of pigments used in paints

00:00:38.038 --> 00:00:40.498 position:50% align:center
were procured at apothecaries
and then mixed

00:00:40.582 --> 00:00:42.375 position:50% align:center
at individual workshops.

00:00:42.459 --> 00:00:44.586 position:50% align:center
Arte, from over
at Leo's place, right?

00:00:44.669 --> 00:00:46.546 position:50% align:center
You're not your
usual cheerful self,

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:49.090 position:50% align:center
if you don't mind me saying so.

00:00:49.174 --> 00:00:50.967 position:50% align:center
Can't imagine why...

00:00:52.677 --> 00:00:55.180 position:50% align:center
[stomach growling]

00:00:55.263 --> 00:00:56.765 position:50% align:center
Don't give in!

00:00:56.848 --> 00:00:59.392 position:50% align:center
The marketplace's a nightmare
for me this time of the week.

00:01:00.352 --> 00:01:01.728 position:50% align:center
[stomach growling]

00:01:01.811 --> 00:01:04.064 position:50% align:center
[ARTE] Maybe if I knew why
Leo made us fast on Fridays,

00:01:04.147 --> 00:01:05.565 position:50% align:center
it would be easier.

00:02:43.038 --> 00:02:46.374 position:50% align:center
Watch your tone
when you address me!

00:02:46.458 --> 00:02:48.585 position:50% align:center
I give you work and this
is how you thank me?

00:02:48.668 --> 00:02:50.211 position:50% align:center
You damn ingrate!

00:02:50.295 --> 00:02:54.132 position:50% align:center
[grunts] You'll do the job,
exactly as I say!

00:02:54.215 --> 00:02:55.800 position:50% align:center
We're through here.

00:03:04.893 --> 00:03:07.979 position:50% align:center
I've never seen that man before,
who is he, Master Leo?

00:03:08.063 --> 00:03:10.190 position:50% align:center
An insufferable longtime client.

00:03:10.273 --> 00:03:12.067 position:50% align:center
Apparently, he was
abroad for a while,

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.778 position:50% align:center
but now he's back and
demanding a new piece.

00:03:14.861 --> 00:03:17.489 position:50% align:center
Oh! Another patron of
yours, like Veronica, then!

00:03:17.572 --> 00:03:20.867 position:50% align:center
[LEO]
No. "Inescapable bond" my ass.

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.579 position:50% align:center
Tch! Look at this nonsense.

00:03:24.662 --> 00:03:25.955 position:50% align:center
The request forms?

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:27.290 position:50% align:center
Let's see...

00:03:27.374 --> 00:03:28.541 position:50% align:center
What's so odd about them?

00:03:28.625 --> 00:03:30.669 position:50% align:center
Wha--? This can't be right!

00:03:30.752 --> 00:03:33.046 position:50% align:center
Uh, sorry, was an extra zero
added to the price

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:34.673 position:50% align:center
by mistake or something?

00:03:34.756 --> 00:03:37.509 position:50% align:center
But check the
specifics for the order.

00:03:37.592 --> 00:03:39.302 position:50% align:center
[ARTE] He's requesting
a portrait using

00:03:39.386 --> 00:03:41.429 position:50% align:center
expensive gold and blue paints.

00:03:41.513 --> 00:03:44.307 position:50% align:center
Multiple figures in frame,
a complicated subject.

00:03:44.391 --> 00:03:45.975 position:50% align:center
And on top of all that...

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:48.687 position:50% align:center
Robbery! We won't be able
to break even with this!

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:51.523 position:50% align:center
Right, so we can't
accept the order as is.

00:03:51.606 --> 00:03:54.192 position:50% align:center
I need to go negotiate with him.

00:03:54.275 --> 00:03:56.444 position:50% align:center
It's so annoying, I could die.

00:03:58.321 --> 00:04:01.533 position:50% align:center
[LEO] Sorry. Didn't mean
to get so emotional.

00:04:01.616 --> 00:04:04.953 position:50% align:center
[ARTE] I don't think I've ever
seen Leo like this before.

00:04:05.036 --> 00:04:06.913 position:50% align:center
He never complains about work.

00:04:09.457 --> 00:04:12.460 position:50% align:center
[ARTE] Um. How would you feel
if I went in your place?

00:04:12.544 --> 00:04:13.878 position:50% align:center
What?

00:04:13.962 --> 00:04:15.755 position:50% align:center
Well, I've been thinking
that I should take on tasks

00:04:15.839 --> 00:04:17.632 position:50% align:center
like negotiating
with clients for you

00:04:17.716 --> 00:04:19.426 position:50% align:center
so that I'm better
prepared for the future,

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:21.678 position:50% align:center
and this seems like
the perfect opportunity!

00:04:21.761 --> 00:04:24.597 position:50% align:center
Because... if I want to
be a self-sufficient artist

00:04:24.681 --> 00:04:27.851 position:50% align:center
like you, I need to learn
those kinds of skills!

00:04:29.019 --> 00:04:31.688 position:50% align:center
[ARTE] Plus, my upbringing
gives me an advantage!

00:04:31.771 --> 00:04:33.356 position:50% align:center
Growing up in a noble
household, you get used

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.192 position:50% align:center
to communicating
with important people.

00:04:36.276 --> 00:04:38.486 position:50% align:center
I can tell that you're
only offering because you know

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:40.530 position:50% align:center
I don't want to do it.

00:04:40.613 --> 00:04:42.365 position:50% align:center
I thought so.

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:43.992 position:50% align:center
Forget I asked, then.

00:04:44.075 --> 00:04:47.704 position:50% align:center
I'll just leave it to you
and stay out of your way.

00:04:47.787 --> 00:04:50.331 position:50% align:center
Although. I suppose
there's a chance he might be

00:04:50.415 --> 00:04:53.710 position:50% align:center
more affable if he haggled
with a woman instead of me.

00:04:53.793 --> 00:04:55.086 position:50% align:center
Take care of it.

00:04:55.587 --> 00:04:57.255 position:50% align:center
The job, it's yours.

00:05:04.095 --> 00:05:06.723 position:50% align:center
[ARTE] The client's house
should be nearby.

00:05:06.806 --> 00:05:08.058 position:50% align:center
Compared to where we live,

00:05:08.141 --> 00:05:10.810 position:50% align:center
the atmosphere here
is so different.

00:05:10.894 --> 00:05:13.938 position:50% align:center
[ARTE] As if the entire
district is one big workshop.

00:05:16.608 --> 00:05:18.526 position:50% align:center
This is it.

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:22.030 position:50% align:center
Apparently, he's a wealthy
merchant who oversees this area.

00:05:25.367 --> 00:05:26.659 position:50% align:center
[SERVANT 05A]
Please wait in here.

00:05:35.543 --> 00:05:40.006 position:50% align:center
[ARTE gasps]
This room's like a dream.

00:05:42.092 --> 00:05:44.135 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
Incredibile.

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:46.971 position:50% align:center
I've never seen
so many paintings.

00:05:54.312 --> 00:05:55.355 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.944 position:50% align:center
Oh. You must
be Maestro Ubertino.

00:06:01.027 --> 00:06:03.780 position:50% align:center
Please excuse me, sir.
I've come here to talk.

00:06:03.863 --> 00:06:05.490 position:50% align:center
[UBERTINO]
I was told Leo's apprentice

00:06:05.573 --> 00:06:07.033 position:50% align:center
would be waiting for me.

00:06:07.117 --> 00:06:09.536 position:50% align:center
Is that you, little girl?

00:06:09.619 --> 00:06:11.788 position:50% align:center
Hard to believe
he would take on anyone,

00:06:11.871 --> 00:06:13.039 position:50% align:center
let alone a woman.

00:06:13.123 --> 00:06:16.126 position:50% align:center
Maybe I don't know him
as well as I thought.

00:06:16.209 --> 00:06:19.087 position:50% align:center
Or perhaps you're
attempting to deceive me.

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:23.508 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Nothing of the sort!
No one benefits from lying!

00:06:23.591 --> 00:06:27.220 position:50% align:center
I assure you, sir, I'm Master
Leo's apprentice, Arte.

00:06:27.303 --> 00:06:28.680 position:50% align:center
[UBERTINO]
Hmm...

00:06:32.058 --> 00:06:34.728 position:50% align:center
Very well, then. Come along.

00:06:34.811 --> 00:06:38.481 position:50% align:center
Let's hear what's on your mind.
We'll talk in my study.

00:06:41.735 --> 00:06:43.445 position:50% align:center
I hope you don't mind standing.

00:06:43.528 --> 00:06:44.446 position:50% align:center
Enter.

00:06:44.529 --> 00:06:45.739 position:50% align:center
Thank you, sir.

00:06:47.449 --> 00:06:50.410 position:50% align:center
[ARTE] Compared to the drawing
room, this one's barren.

00:06:50.493 --> 00:06:51.745 position:50% align:center
I'm waiting.

00:06:51.828 --> 00:06:54.789 position:50% align:center
Why has Leo's apprentice
decided to pay me a visit?

00:06:54.873 --> 00:06:56.124 position:50% align:center
Oh, right!

00:06:56.207 --> 00:06:59.127 position:50% align:center
I was hoping we could make
one or two small changes

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:01.588 position:50% align:center
to the order for the new
painting you commissioned?

00:07:01.671 --> 00:07:05.300 position:50% align:center
[UBERTINO] Is that so? What
exactly do you mean by that?

00:07:05.383 --> 00:07:06.718 position:50% align:center
If the order displeases you,

00:07:06.801 --> 00:07:08.678 position:50% align:center
perhaps I should
go to someone else.

00:07:08.762 --> 00:07:09.679 position:50% align:center
[ARTE whimpers]

00:07:09.763 --> 00:07:10.889 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
Stay strong.

00:07:10.972 --> 00:07:13.558 position:50% align:center
He may be intimidating,
but I can't back down.

00:07:13.641 --> 00:07:15.393 position:50% align:center
No matter what.

00:07:15.477 --> 00:07:18.813 position:50% align:center
I have to make this
negotiation a success!

00:07:19.939 --> 00:07:21.983 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry. I failed you.

00:07:22.067 --> 00:07:23.360 position:50% align:center
I'm not surprised.

00:07:23.443 --> 00:07:24.903 position:50% align:center
Bargaining with that
old goat has always been

00:07:24.986 --> 00:07:26.488 position:50% align:center
like pulling teeth.

00:07:26.571 --> 00:07:29.491 position:50% align:center
Just leave all of this to me,
and go back to your usual work.

00:07:29.574 --> 00:07:30.784 position:50% align:center
I'll handle it.

00:07:30.867 --> 00:07:33.328 position:50% align:center
Please, Master Leo,
allow me another chance

00:07:33.411 --> 00:07:35.080 position:50% align:center
to try and change his mind.

00:07:35.163 --> 00:07:36.414 position:50% align:center
[LEO]
Hmm?

00:07:36.498 --> 00:07:38.208 position:50% align:center
You were kind enough
to give me this opportunity,

00:07:38.291 --> 00:07:40.335 position:50% align:center
and I want to see it
through to the end!

00:07:40.418 --> 00:07:42.128 position:50% align:center
I want to try to do better.

00:07:42.212 --> 00:07:44.673 position:50% align:center
I realize that
this is selfish of me,

00:07:44.756 --> 00:07:46.800 position:50% align:center
but after meeting with him,
it became apparent that

00:07:46.883 --> 00:07:49.761 position:50% align:center
I should have gone in
there more prepared.

00:07:49.844 --> 00:07:52.639 position:50% align:center
Well, bruised egos
are good motivators I suppose.

00:07:52.722 --> 00:07:53.807 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:55.058 position:50% align:center
Arte.

00:07:55.141 --> 00:07:56.893 position:50% align:center
Isn't your dream to one day
become an artist

00:07:56.976 --> 00:07:59.229 position:50% align:center
who's able to survive
independently?

00:07:59.312 --> 00:08:00.563 position:50% align:center
Yes!

00:08:00.647 --> 00:08:02.023 position:50% align:center
There's more to being a
painter than just creating

00:08:02.107 --> 00:08:04.025 position:50% align:center
memorable works of art.

00:08:04.109 --> 00:08:06.194 position:50% align:center
You must be able to have
regular jobs coming in

00:08:06.277 --> 00:08:07.987 position:50% align:center
and make a profit.

00:08:08.071 --> 00:08:10.156 position:50% align:center
Think of this as
a learning opportunity.

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:13.243 position:50% align:center
Until you're happy with your
results, don't give in.

00:08:13.326 --> 00:08:14.744 position:50% align:center
Thank you, Master Leo!

00:08:14.828 --> 00:08:16.329 position:50% align:center
I'll do my best!

00:08:17.455 --> 00:08:18.957 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
All right.

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:21.751 position:50% align:center

strategy for dealing with him.

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:29.759 position:50% align:center
Arte, my friend!
You've come back to visit me!

00:08:29.843 --> 00:08:31.344 position:50% align:center
What is it?

00:08:31.428 --> 00:08:33.638 position:50% align:center
[ARTE whimpers]
I need your help with something

00:08:33.722 --> 00:08:36.725 position:50% align:center
very important, Veronica!

00:08:36.808 --> 00:08:39.728 position:50% align:center
[VERONICA] A negotiation?
With the Ubertino?

00:08:39.811 --> 00:08:41.604 position:50% align:center
So you know who he is?

00:08:41.688 --> 00:08:44.107 position:50% align:center
Of course. Knowing all
the wealthy men in town

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:46.276 position:50% align:center
is part of the job, my dear.

00:08:46.359 --> 00:08:49.487 position:50% align:center
Huh... He started out
buying and selling wool,

00:08:49.571 --> 00:08:51.948 position:50% align:center
then branched out,
amassing a sizeable fortune

00:08:52.032 --> 00:08:55.243 position:50% align:center
within his lifetime.
A true success story.

00:08:55.326 --> 00:08:58.705 position:50% align:center
Wow, I had no idea
that he was so accomplished.

00:08:58.788 --> 00:09:00.540 position:50% align:center
[VERONICA] Now, then.
I've told you his story,

00:09:00.623 --> 00:09:03.001 position:50% align:center
so explain how this
all involves me.

00:09:03.084 --> 00:09:05.003 position:50% align:center
I thought because
of your line of work,

00:09:05.086 --> 00:09:07.380 position:50% align:center
you're probably the most
knowledgeable person I know

00:09:07.464 --> 00:09:09.341 position:50% align:center
when it comes to
the art of negotiating

00:09:09.424 --> 00:09:12.010 position:50% align:center
and turning conversations
in your favor.

00:09:12.093 --> 00:09:13.595 position:50% align:center
That's why I came over.

00:09:13.678 --> 00:09:16.181 position:50% align:center
I request that you
to teach me your ways!

00:09:16.264 --> 00:09:20.226 position:50% align:center
[VERONICA] Ah-hah! Never in my
life did I imagine anybody would

00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:22.479 position:50% align:center
seek me out for
my teaching skills!

00:09:22.562 --> 00:09:23.480 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:09:23.563 --> 00:09:25.231 position:50% align:center
Very well.

00:09:25.315 --> 00:09:26.691 position:50% align:center
Consider it done, dear.

00:09:26.775 --> 00:09:29.611 position:50% align:center
Who could ever turn down
such an earnest request?

00:09:44.209 --> 00:09:46.711 position:50% align:center
I am deeply sorry and request
forgiveness for my lack

of preparation on the last
occasion we had to meet.

00:09:50.465 --> 00:09:52.550 position:50% align:center
I've come here today

to create a finished
product that will

[UBERTINO] Hmm. For the moment,
you have my attention.

Thank you, signore.

We'll start with your posture.

[VERONICA] It's all about
projecting an air of confidence.

And whatever you do,
never stop smiling.

00:10:13.071 --> 00:10:16.074 position:50% align:center
You should always be
the picture of grace and poise.

00:10:16.157 --> 00:10:17.951 position:50% align:center

very little--

00:10:23.456 --> 00:10:25.583 position:50% align:center
would you still be content
with your vocation?

00:10:25.667 --> 00:10:27.544 position:50% align:center
You simply can't afford
to think that way.

I know the market
value for paints!

00:11:05.081 --> 00:11:07.959 position:50% align:center
The total provided for
materials is appropriate.

00:11:08.043 --> 00:11:09.919 position:50% align:center
With all due respect,
Maestro Ubertino,

00:11:10.003 --> 00:11:12.839 position:50% align:center
the proposed compensation is
nowhere near enough.

00:11:12.922 --> 00:11:14.924 position:50% align:center
More, then? I understand.

00:11:15.008 --> 00:11:16.885 position:50% align:center
You and your master
are attempting to extort

00:11:16.968 --> 00:11:18.887 position:50% align:center
additional money
from me, is that it?

00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:21.264 position:50% align:center
No matter how expensive
the materials may be,

00:11:21.348 --> 00:11:23.308 position:50% align:center
if they aren't put in
the hands of a skilled artist,

00:11:23.391 --> 00:11:27.354 position:50% align:center
the value of a painting is less
than the sum of its parts.

00:11:27.437 --> 00:11:30.732 position:50% align:center
Hmm! And that's where
my master comes in.

00:11:30.815 --> 00:11:33.276 position:50% align:center
The rate is as it stands
because he's spent years

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:35.779 position:50% align:center
learning his craft and can
elevate any commission

00:11:35.862 --> 00:11:37.739 position:50% align:center
into a true work of art.

00:11:37.822 --> 00:11:39.115 position:50% align:center
[UBERTINO]
Hmm...

00:11:39.199 --> 00:11:41.451 position:50% align:center
[ARTE] Have I mentioned
I come from a noble family?

00:11:41.534 --> 00:11:43.453 position:50% align:center
And? What's your point?

00:11:43.536 --> 00:11:45.663 position:50% align:center
Are you actually attempting
to argue that I should be

00:11:45.747 --> 00:11:48.166 position:50% align:center
charged more because
of your pedigree?

00:11:48.249 --> 00:11:52.003 position:50% align:center
No, sir, but I would
like you to look these over.

00:11:52.087 --> 00:11:55.006 position:50% align:center
[UBERTINO]
Hmm... Drawings of lace?

00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:59.135 position:50% align:center
Oh? They do appear
rather intricate.

00:11:59.219 --> 00:12:00.720 position:50% align:center

They're studies I drew.

00:12:00.804 --> 00:12:01.846 position:50% align:center
You did?

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:03.306 position:50% align:center
As the daughter of a nobleman,

00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:05.934 position:50% align:center
I was educated in
a variety of subjects,

00:12:06.017 --> 00:12:07.727 position:50% align:center
which included how to crochet.

00:12:07.811 --> 00:12:10.647 position:50% align:center
Out of all the artisans in
Florence, how many do you think

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:13.274 position:50% align:center
can add this level of detail?

00:12:13.358 --> 00:12:14.651 position:50% align:center
[UBERTINO]
Hmm...

00:12:14.734 --> 00:12:17.696 position:50% align:center
[ARTE] Signore. I guarantee our
workshop will increase

00:12:17.779 --> 00:12:19.531 position:50% align:center
the value of your painting.

00:12:24.119 --> 00:12:25.954 position:50% align:center
[UBERTINO] Hmph.
Stop blabbering and give me

00:12:26.037 --> 00:12:27.872 position:50% align:center
that contract to sign.

00:12:27.956 --> 00:12:30.000 position:50% align:center
But I'm warning you,
kid, you won't get away

00:12:30.083 --> 00:12:31.334 position:50% align:center
with delivering
a portrait that doesn't

00:12:31.418 --> 00:12:33.211 position:50% align:center
completely satisfy me.

00:12:33.294 --> 00:12:35.255 position:50% align:center
Also, do me a favor
and drop the facade.

00:12:35.338 --> 00:12:37.007 position:50% align:center
It doesn't suit you.

00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:39.843 position:50% align:center
Did you get lessons
from a courtesan or something?

00:12:39.926 --> 00:12:41.052 position:50% align:center
Quite a hefty sum,

00:12:41.136 --> 00:12:43.388 position:50% align:center
but I suppose it
can't be helped.

00:12:43.471 --> 00:12:45.223 position:50% align:center
There's nothing
in this world more wasteful

00:12:45.306 --> 00:12:47.183 position:50% align:center
than paying for artwork.

00:12:47.267 --> 00:12:50.103 position:50% align:center
Huh? What about
the art in your parlor?

00:12:50.186 --> 00:12:53.231 position:50% align:center
[UBERTINO] I use that room
to intimidate my customers.

00:12:53.314 --> 00:12:54.941 position:50% align:center
As if I'd waste money
on something that

00:12:55.025 --> 00:12:57.819 position:50% align:center
just collects dust otherwise.

00:12:57.902 --> 00:12:59.237 position:50% align:center
[ARTE] That explains
why the drawing room

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:03.491 position:50% align:center
is so lavishly decorated,
but his study is spartan.

00:13:03.575 --> 00:13:06.286 position:50% align:center
I see, but, um,
you do have an appreciation

00:13:06.369 --> 00:13:08.455 position:50% align:center
for artwork, don't you?

00:13:08.538 --> 00:13:10.498 position:50% align:center
[UBERTINO]
No, not in the slightest.

00:13:10.582 --> 00:13:12.334 position:50% align:center
Doesn't matter the painting,
when I look at them,

00:13:12.417 --> 00:13:14.252 position:50% align:center
I feel nothing.

00:13:14.336 --> 00:13:16.338 position:50% align:center
I just happen to know
the difference between

00:13:16.421 --> 00:13:19.341 position:50% align:center
what's considered
good and bad art.

00:13:19.424 --> 00:13:22.469 position:50% align:center
Hmm? What's wrong?
Don't tell me you're surprised.

00:13:22.552 --> 00:13:24.346 position:50% align:center
Were you naive enough
to think that paintings

00:13:24.429 --> 00:13:26.848 position:50% align:center
are only commissioned
by art lovers?

00:13:26.931 --> 00:13:29.726 position:50% align:center
No! Uh, who would believe that?

00:13:29.809 --> 00:13:32.604 position:50% align:center
[UBERTINO] I use them to
bribe influential people,

00:13:32.687 --> 00:13:36.107 position:50% align:center
and as donations to curry
favor with the Church.

00:13:36.191 --> 00:13:37.776 position:50% align:center
Paintings aren't always
ordered by people

00:13:37.859 --> 00:13:39.736 position:50% align:center
who mean to enjoy them.

00:13:39.819 --> 00:13:44.032 position:50% align:center
People who have money order them
so they can be used as tools.

00:13:44.115 --> 00:13:45.367 position:50% align:center
As tools?

00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:47.369 position:50% align:center
In the future, I have
no doubt you'll be forced

00:13:47.452 --> 00:13:49.704 position:50% align:center
to work with other clients
who share a very similar view

00:13:49.788 --> 00:13:51.956 position:50% align:center
when it comes to artwork.

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:53.875 position:50% align:center
If what I've said
comes as a shock,

00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:58.380 position:50% align:center
one day, you might find yourself
disillusioned with your job.

00:13:58.463 --> 00:14:01.007 position:50% align:center
On the contrary, I'm excited.

00:14:01.091 --> 00:14:03.343 position:50% align:center
My goal is to become so
proficient at my trade,

00:14:03.426 --> 00:14:07.847 position:50% align:center
I'll be able to impress even
the most dispassionate client.

Uhh... Uh, thank you?

00:14:16.898 --> 00:14:19.734 position:50% align:center
At least, I'm assuming you
were paying me a compliment.

00:14:19.818 --> 00:14:22.987 position:50% align:center
Against all odds,
I find myself liking you, kid.

00:14:25.782 --> 00:14:27.075 position:50% align:center
Well then.

00:14:28.785 --> 00:14:31.079 position:50% align:center

Oh, wait!

00:14:32.372 --> 00:14:34.207 position:50% align:center
If you'll permit me,
Maestro Ubertino,

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:36.751 position:50% align:center
I have one more favor to ask.

00:14:36.835 --> 00:14:39.462 position:50% align:center
You've seen it twice already,
isn't that enough?

00:14:39.546 --> 00:14:42.424 position:50% align:center
Who wouldn't want to be
surrounded by so many paintings?

describe how I feel!

These paintings are...

00:15:01.026 --> 00:15:04.738 position:50% align:center
They're Leo's. Nearly all
of them have his touch.

00:15:04.821 --> 00:15:06.823 position:50% align:center
If you've gone to him
for this many commissions,

00:15:06.906 --> 00:15:08.283 position:50% align:center
you must have a soft
spot in your heart

00:15:08.366 --> 00:15:10.618 position:50% align:center
for my master after all!

00:15:10.702 --> 00:15:12.370 position:50% align:center
[UBERTINO]
I despise the man!

00:15:12.454 --> 00:15:16.291 position:50% align:center
We share only one thing.
An inescapable bond!

Oh no, he's radiating pure rage!

[UBERTINO]
Besides, you're mistaken.

00:15:20.545 --> 00:15:24.090 position:50% align:center
Half the paintings in this room
were done by his master.

Leo's master?

00:15:26.843 --> 00:15:28.219 position:50% align:center
But, hold on...

00:15:28.303 --> 00:15:29.804 position:50% align:center
If that's true...

00:15:29.888 --> 00:15:31.264 position:50% align:center
I mean obviously,
he must have been younger

00:15:31.348 --> 00:15:32.640 position:50% align:center
at some point, but still...

00:15:32.724 --> 00:15:35.143 position:50% align:center
Do you know how difficult
that is to imagine?

It'd be near impossible

Well, I convinced him!

You're joking.

00:16:16.601 --> 00:16:17.977 position:50% align:center
It might have been
helpful if you'd told me

00:16:18.061 --> 00:16:21.064 position:50% align:center
your master and Ubertino
knew each other.

00:16:21.147 --> 00:16:23.441 position:50% align:center
So he mentioned my master?

00:16:23.525 --> 00:16:24.901 position:50% align:center
What exactly did he say?

00:16:24.984 --> 00:16:27.112 position:50% align:center
Well, not much
about him, actually.

00:16:27.195 --> 00:16:29.030 position:50% align:center
Oh, but he did mention
he's known you since

00:16:29.114 --> 00:16:30.532 position:50% align:center
you were a child!

00:16:30.615 --> 00:16:32.200 position:50% align:center
Why have you never
shared anything about

00:16:32.283 --> 00:16:33.910 position:50% align:center
your past with me?

00:16:33.993 --> 00:16:35.328 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:16:35.412 --> 00:16:37.497 position:50% align:center
I was surprised to find
out you even had a childhood!

00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:38.915 position:50% align:center
Of course I did.

00:16:38.998 --> 00:16:41.376 position:50% align:center
I wasn't aware you were
interested in hearing about it.

00:16:41.459 --> 00:16:45.964 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Why wouldn't I be?! Oh...

00:16:46.965 --> 00:16:49.050 position:50% align:center
Obviously, I want to hear
all about when my master

00:16:49.134 --> 00:16:50.802 position:50% align:center
was young and apprenticing
at a workshop,

00:16:50.885 --> 00:16:51.803 position:50% align:center
before he had his own!

00:16:51.886 --> 00:16:53.722 position:50% align:center
So stop holding out on me!

[giggles]

00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:56.683 position:50% align:center
Speaking of holding out,
you aren't even attempting

00:16:56.766 --> 00:16:58.518 position:50% align:center
to conceal your
curiosity anymore.

00:16:58.601 --> 00:17:02.605 position:50% align:center
All things considered,
it's sort of refreshing to see.

00:17:02.689 --> 00:17:04.691 position:50% align:center
When I was an apprentice.

00:17:04.774 --> 00:17:07.110 position:50% align:center
I didn't make any careless
mistakes like you,

00:17:07.193 --> 00:17:09.320 position:50% align:center
nor was I clumsy,
or nearly as loud.

[ARTE whines]

00:17:11.322 --> 00:17:13.491 position:50% align:center
[LEO] However, before
I joined a workshop,

00:17:13.575 --> 00:17:15.118 position:50% align:center
we had something in common.

00:17:15.201 --> 00:17:16.453 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
Huh...?

00:17:16.536 --> 00:17:18.872 position:50% align:center
I went to studios around town,
knocking on doors.

00:17:18.955 --> 00:17:22.000 position:50% align:center
Most turned me away without
even looking at my work.

00:17:22.083 --> 00:17:23.835 position:50% align:center
[ARTE] Leo also struggled
to find somewhere

00:17:23.918 --> 00:17:25.628 position:50% align:center
that would accept him?

00:17:25.712 --> 00:17:27.339 position:50% align:center
That's a bit surprising.

00:17:27.422 --> 00:17:30.050 position:50% align:center
I was under the impression most
people secured apprenticeships

00:17:30.133 --> 00:17:32.469 position:50% align:center
thanks to their
parents' connections.

00:17:32.552 --> 00:17:35.138 position:50% align:center
Typically that's the case,
but I was a beggar.

00:17:35.221 --> 00:17:37.932 position:50% align:center
--[gasps]
--[LEO] I worked diligently.

00:17:38.016 --> 00:17:41.186 position:50% align:center
Still, there's no denying
I was a troublemaker.

00:17:41.269 --> 00:17:42.604 position:50% align:center
I didn't get along with anyone,

00:17:42.687 --> 00:17:45.190 position:50% align:center
but my master never kicked
me out despite it all.

00:17:45.273 --> 00:17:48.610 position:50% align:center
It sounds like he
was a very kind man.

00:17:48.693 --> 00:17:51.738 position:50% align:center
Kind, but cold and strict
when he needed to be.

00:17:53.865 --> 00:17:54.949 position:50% align:center
[ARTE gasps]

00:17:59.954 --> 00:18:02.957 position:50% align:center
[ARTE] You said you were
a beggar back then, Master Leo?

00:18:03.041 --> 00:18:04.459 position:50% align:center
Yes?

00:18:04.542 --> 00:18:07.837 position:50% align:center
[ARTE] I'm thankful that you
were the one who took me in.

00:18:07.921 --> 00:18:09.339 position:50% align:center
And no one else.

00:18:11.091 --> 00:18:13.551 position:50% align:center

you still became a master

I know there's a lot I can
learn from somebody like you,

00:18:17.806 --> 00:18:19.599 position:50% align:center

you're faster at your work?

I finish before you do!

00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:41.162 position:50% align:center
Maybe the question you all
ought to be asking yourselves

00:18:41.246 --> 00:18:44.666 position:50% align:center
is why you're lazy despite
being born so lucky!

Just to be clear, they're
the ones that started the fight.

00:18:52.007 --> 00:18:54.634 position:50% align:center
[LEO'S MASTER] And you
should've just ignored them.

00:18:54.718 --> 00:18:56.386 position:50% align:center
This part needs more work, Leo.

00:18:56.469 --> 00:18:58.388 position:50% align:center
We've already been
over this before.

make the same mistakes.

[APPRENTICES laughing]

00:19:03.768 --> 00:19:05.937 position:50% align:center
[LEO] No matter how many errors
the other apprentices make,

00:19:06.021 --> 00:19:08.440 position:50% align:center
the master never scolds them.

00:19:08.523 --> 00:19:10.775 position:50% align:center
I bet it's because
I used to be a beggar.

00:19:12.736 --> 00:19:15.113 position:50% align:center
[LEO]
That's what I thought at first.

00:19:15.196 --> 00:19:17.949 position:50% align:center
But as time passed, I could see
the gap between my abilities

00:19:18.033 --> 00:19:20.785 position:50% align:center
and the other apprentices'
beginning to widen.

00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:24.205 position:50% align:center
[LEO] It was then
I finally understood what

00:19:24.289 --> 00:19:26.332 position:50% align:center
my master was thinking.

00:19:26.416 --> 00:19:29.419 position:50% align:center
It wasn't about being kind.

00:19:29.502 --> 00:19:31.504 position:50% align:center
He just wasn't interested
in helping those who didn't

00:19:31.588 --> 00:19:33.131 position:50% align:center
put in the effort.

00:19:33.882 --> 00:19:36.968 position:50% align:center
[LEO] It didn't matter if I was
poor, he was tough on me

00:19:37.052 --> 00:19:39.304 position:50% align:center
because he saw my potential.

00:19:44.684 --> 00:19:47.103 position:50% align:center
Well, it's fair to say
the quality of the portrait

00:19:47.187 --> 00:19:49.898 position:50% align:center
reflects the amount
I had to shell out.

00:19:49.981 --> 00:19:52.567 position:50% align:center
Be that as it may,
I noticed your tools

00:19:52.650 --> 00:19:54.110 position:50% align:center

00:19:54.194 --> 00:19:56.654 position:50% align:center

new ones as well.

[ARTE] The brushes my father
gave me were probably some of

00:19:59.115 --> 00:20:02.452 position:50% align:center
the finest available,
but now that I think about,

00:20:02.535 --> 00:20:04.746 position:50% align:center
I've never felt like
Leo's were inferior.

All this money,
yet you continue to dress

00:20:07.499 --> 00:20:09.167 position:50% align:center
like a vagrant!

00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:10.502 position:50% align:center
And on top of that,

00:20:10.585 --> 00:20:12.796 position:50% align:center
I hear you fast on Fridays,

Why didn't I realize it sooner?

That's why Leo doesn't
splurge on food and clothes.

00:20:19.552 --> 00:20:22.972 position:50% align:center
Whatever money he saves, he
invests back into the workshop.

Since you're swimming in florin,

to do with his work, right?

00:21:29.289 --> 00:21:32.709 position:50% align:center
Every time he commissions a new
piece the price is extravagant.
