[MAID 01A]
Buongiorno.

00:01:02.228 --> 00:01:04.564 position:50% align:center
Lady Arte, I've brought your
dress for this morning.

00:01:04.647 --> 00:01:07.400 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
My lady! How improper!

00:01:07.484 --> 00:01:08.818 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Shh! Shh!

00:01:14.032 --> 00:01:15.950 position:50% align:center
I'll be done in just a second.

00:02:47.125 --> 00:02:50.003 position:50% align:center
[ARTE] I was born into
a noble Florentine family.

00:02:50.086 --> 00:02:53.381 position:50% align:center
For as long as I can remember,
I've had a passion for drawing.

00:02:53.465 --> 00:02:54.924 position:50% align:center
My father always supported me

00:02:55.008 --> 00:02:57.177 position:50% align:center
and my artistic pursuits.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.014 position:50% align:center
But then last month--
he passed away.

00:03:01.097 --> 00:03:02.557 position:50% align:center
Even though
we're a noble family,

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.852 position:50% align:center
we're far from being wealthy,
which presents a problem.

00:03:05.935 --> 00:03:07.187 position:50% align:center
Namely...

00:03:08.688 --> 00:03:10.315 position:50% align:center
Are those my sketches?!

00:03:12.317 --> 00:03:15.945 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
Mother! What are you doing?!

00:03:16.029 --> 00:03:18.198 position:50% align:center
I'm disposing
of these useless scraps.

00:03:18.281 --> 00:03:20.658 position:50% align:center
You can't!
I worked hard on those!

00:03:22.202 --> 00:03:23.328 position:50% align:center

Hmph!

[ARTE gasps, screams]

00:03:26.873 --> 00:03:28.458 position:50% align:center
We only meant
for you to learn drawing

00:03:28.541 --> 00:03:30.126 position:50% align:center
as a way to pass the time.

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:34.881 position:50% align:center
[ARTE'S MOTHER] How do you
expect to win over a gentleman

00:03:34.964 --> 00:03:37.342 position:50% align:center
when it occupies
every spare moment?

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.595 position:50% align:center
Is it really so
important for me to try

00:03:40.679 --> 00:03:42.222 position:50% align:center
and attract a suitor?

00:03:42.305 --> 00:03:43.848 position:50% align:center
You're almost 15.

00:03:43.932 --> 00:03:45.100 position:50% align:center
At this stage in your life,

00:03:45.183 --> 00:03:47.352 position:50% align:center
marriage should be the
only thing on your mind.

00:03:47.435 --> 00:03:49.145 position:50% align:center
Your father's gone,
and we're only able

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:52.315 position:50% align:center
to put together a meager
dowry, which means finding

00:03:52.399 --> 00:03:54.067 position:50% align:center
a potential match for you
will prove to be

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.069 position:50% align:center
all the more difficult.

00:03:56.152 --> 00:03:57.404 position:50% align:center
The fact is,
if you expect to have

00:03:57.487 --> 00:04:00.323 position:50% align:center
a halfway decent life,
your only choice is to find

00:04:00.407 --> 00:04:03.743 position:50% align:center
yourself a proper husband.

00:04:03.827 --> 00:04:06.705 position:50% align:center
[ARTE] I know what you mean
by a "decent life."

00:04:06.788 --> 00:04:09.708 position:50% align:center
Staying at home without any
freedom and living each day

00:04:09.791 --> 00:04:12.168 position:50% align:center
like a bird trapped
inside a cage!

00:04:13.586 --> 00:04:14.713 position:50% align:center
You don't realize it,

00:04:14.796 --> 00:04:16.923 position:50% align:center
but I'm looking out
for your best interests.

00:04:17.007 --> 00:04:19.009 position:50% align:center

[ARTE'S MOTHER]
I don't see how these skills

00:04:45.535 --> 00:04:47.203 position:50% align:center
will do the girl any good.

00:04:47.287 --> 00:04:48.830 position:50% align:center
Come now, don't say that.

00:04:48.913 --> 00:04:50.415 position:50% align:center
[ARTE'S MOTHER]
It's fine as a distraction,

00:04:50.498 --> 00:04:52.250 position:50% align:center
but she's becoming too obsessed.

00:04:52.334 --> 00:04:53.918 position:50% align:center
What sort of man will
want to take a wife

00:04:54.002 --> 00:04:56.546 position:50% align:center
who's only interested in art?

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:57.922 position:50% align:center
Don't tell me
you haven't noticed

00:04:58.006 --> 00:05:00.091 position:50% align:center
how depressed she looks
with her other instruction.

00:05:00.175 --> 00:05:03.053 position:50% align:center
It's only when she's drawing
that her face truly lights up.

00:05:04.637 --> 00:05:06.681 position:50% align:center
[ARTE'S FATHER] It does my heart
good to see her so happy.

00:05:08.391 --> 00:05:10.769 position:50% align:center
Besides. As long
as she stands strong,

00:05:10.852 --> 00:05:14.397 position:50% align:center
and continues believing in
herself, she'll find someone.

00:05:14.481 --> 00:05:17.275 position:50% align:center

her passion and her charm.

00:18:41.162 --> 00:18:43.206 position:50% align:center
Then I look forward
to working beside you!

00:18:43.289 --> 00:18:44.374 position:50% align:center
Leo, I...

00:18:44.457 --> 00:18:45.458 position:50% align:center
Oh, sorry!

00:18:45.542 --> 00:18:47.961 position:50% align:center
I meant to say Master Leo.

00:18:48.503 --> 00:18:50.005 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
I have a Master!

00:18:50.088 --> 00:18:52.340 position:50% align:center
[LEO]
Not if you don't quiet down!

00:18:52.424 --> 00:18:54.509 position:50% align:center
[ARTE'S MOTHER]
Stop packing this instant!

00:18:54.592 --> 00:18:57.012 position:50% align:center
You don't have my
permission to leave, Arte!

00:18:57.095 --> 00:18:59.431 position:50% align:center
[ARTE] I don't need it.
I've already decided.

00:18:59.514 --> 00:19:01.016 position:50% align:center
And there's nothing
you can say to stop me

00:19:01.099 --> 00:19:02.475 position:50% align:center
from going, Mother.

00:19:02.559 --> 00:19:04.227 position:50% align:center
[ARTE'S MOTHER]
Why are you talking nonsense?

00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:06.271 position:50% align:center
No woman wants to be a painter!

00:19:06.354 --> 00:19:09.190 position:50% align:center
You're going to fail
and regret ever leaving!

00:19:09.274 --> 00:19:10.400 position:50% align:center
You don't get it.

00:19:10.483 --> 00:19:12.360 position:50% align:center
I'd rather try
and fail then live

00:19:12.444 --> 00:19:14.571 position:50% align:center
to regret not trying at all.

00:19:14.654 --> 00:19:15.822 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:21.536 --> 00:19:23.747 position:50% align:center
[ARTE] If I'm going to
regret it either way,

00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:25.832 position:50% align:center
I want it to be on my own terms.

00:19:37.052 --> 00:19:40.305 position:50% align:center
[LEO] Oh, it's you.
So you really did come back.

00:19:40.388 --> 00:19:43.808 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir! It's an honor
to start working for you!

00:19:43.892 --> 00:19:45.268 position:50% align:center
No need to bow.

00:19:45.352 --> 00:19:47.270 position:50% align:center
Come on, I'll show
you to your room.

00:19:47.354 --> 00:19:48.438 position:50% align:center
Right!

00:19:53.026 --> 00:19:54.611 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
I finally did it.

00:19:54.694 --> 00:19:58.823 position:50% align:center
Starting today, I'm an
apprentice at a workshop.

00:19:58.907 --> 00:20:01.910 position:50% align:center
[LEO] I built a shed
on the roof a while back.

00:20:01.993 --> 00:20:04.621 position:50% align:center
I'm not going to lie,
it has seen better days.

00:20:04.704 --> 00:20:07.207 position:50% align:center
But like they say,
home is where the heart is.

00:20:07.916 --> 00:20:09.376 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:09.459 --> 00:20:12.045 position:50% align:center
[LEO] From now on,
this is your castle.

00:20:12.128 --> 00:20:13.630 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
Uhh...

00:20:15.507 --> 00:20:18.343 position:50% align:center
[LEO] I'm sure with some
repairs, you can make it work.

00:20:18.426 --> 00:20:19.594 position:50% align:center
Good luck.

00:20:19.678 --> 00:20:21.971 position:50% align:center
You mean I'm expected
to fix this place up?

00:20:22.055 --> 00:20:23.390 position:50% align:center
Alone?

00:20:23.473 --> 00:20:25.809 position:50% align:center
It'll take a miracle
to make this livable!

00:20:25.892 --> 00:20:27.977 position:50% align:center
[LEO]
Mm. Then leave it be.

00:20:28.061 --> 00:20:29.646 position:50% align:center
I don't care,
I'm not living here.

00:20:29.729 --> 00:20:31.439 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:31.523 --> 00:20:32.941 position:50% align:center
Enjoy.

00:20:33.024 --> 00:20:34.317 position:50% align:center
Wait!

00:20:34.401 --> 00:20:37.404 position:50% align:center
Am I really supposed to
spend the night in there?

00:20:37.487 --> 00:20:39.948 position:50% align:center
Where else would you prefer?

00:20:40.031 --> 00:20:42.409 position:50% align:center
Unless you're saying you'd
rather share my bed.

00:20:42.492 --> 00:20:44.369 position:50% align:center
I'll stick with the shack.

00:20:50.208 --> 00:20:52.627 position:50% align:center
Remember, me, if you're
going to regret it either way,

00:20:52.711 --> 00:20:55.088 position:50% align:center
at least you'll suffer
doing what you love!

00:20:55.171 --> 00:20:57.924 position:50% align:center
You hear me?!
This is what I wanted!

00:20:59.718 --> 00:21:01.052 position:50% align:center
So cold!

00:21:01.136 --> 00:21:03.680 position:50% align:center
There's no way I'm gonna
fall asleep like this!

00:21:03.763 --> 00:21:05.724 position:50% align:center
I'll draw to
keep my mind occupied!

00:21:24.659 --> 00:21:26.119 position:50% align:center
Wow.

00:21:26.202 --> 00:21:30.123 position:50% align:center
It's not so bad now that
I see it in the morning light.

00:21:30.206 --> 00:21:33.251 position:50% align:center
This desk will be perfect
with a little touch-up work.

00:21:33.335 --> 00:21:36.463 position:50% align:center
And I can fix these shelves
to hold my supplies.

00:21:39.007 --> 00:21:41.134 position:50% align:center
Right. Let's do this!

00:21:58.485 --> 00:21:59.694 position:50% align:center
[giggles]

00:22:01.613 --> 00:22:04.074 position:50% align:center
[LEO] From now on,
this is your castle.

00:22:07.577 --> 00:22:08.495 position:50% align:center
[yawns]

00:22:08.578 --> 00:22:11.164 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
My new life begins today!

00:23:56.686 --> 00:23:58.313 position:50% align:center
[ARTE] I was able to
convince Leo to take me on

00:23:58.396 --> 00:24:01.316 position:50% align:center
as an apprentice, but can he
and I really get along?

00:24:01.399 --> 00:24:02.525 position:50% align:center
[LEO]
Stop dawdling.

00:24:02.609 --> 00:24:04.944 position:50% align:center
This workroom isn't
going to clean itself.

00:24:05.028 --> 00:24:07.405 position:50% align:center
[ARTE] He may be strict,
but I'm going to do my best!

00:24:07.489 --> 00:24:09.074 position:50% align:center
Next time: "A New Life."

00:24:09.157 --> 00:24:10.200 position:50% align:center
Let's get started!
