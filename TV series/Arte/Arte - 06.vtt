00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:56.559 position:50% align:center
[ARTE] Mm. Then yes,
my old tutor taught me how,

00:07:56.643 --> 00:08:00.313 position:50% align:center
but it was only on a stone
slab about this big.

00:08:00.397 --> 00:08:02.524 position:50% align:center
[LEO] So you have a basic
understanding of how to do it.

00:08:02.607 --> 00:08:04.818 position:50% align:center
Uh? I guess. Yeah.

00:08:07.112 --> 00:08:08.905 position:50% align:center
Here are some supplies for you.

00:08:08.988 --> 00:08:11.032 position:50% align:center
Now then, go ahead and
try to plaster the area

00:08:11.116 --> 00:08:12.492 position:50% align:center
that I've marked
out on the wall.

00:08:12.575 --> 00:08:13.493 position:50% align:center
Ah!

00:08:13.576 --> 00:08:14.494 position:50% align:center
[LEO]
Hurry up!

00:08:14.577 --> 00:08:16.371 position:50% align:center
Right!

00:08:16.454 --> 00:08:18.832 position:50% align:center
[ARTE] First, I have to
mix the lime and water.

00:08:18.915 --> 00:08:20.917 position:50% align:center
The consistency has
to be just right.

00:08:21.001 --> 00:08:22.961 position:50% align:center
Too much water and it won't set.

00:08:23.044 --> 00:08:25.547 position:50% align:center
Stay calm and
take it step by step!

00:08:37.517 --> 00:08:40.854 position:50% align:center
[ARTE sighs]
All right, I'm finished.

00:08:40.937 --> 00:08:42.939 position:50% align:center
[LEO] First of all, the
consistency of the plaster

00:08:43.023 --> 00:08:46.568 position:50% align:center
is incorrect.
It'll crack later.

00:08:46.651 --> 00:08:49.195 position:50% align:center
Also, the surface wasn't
smoothed out properly.

00:08:49.279 --> 00:08:50.572 position:50% align:center
[ARTE gasps]

00:08:50.655 --> 00:08:51.948 position:50% align:center
[LEO]
You went over the lines.

00:08:52.032 --> 00:08:53.116 position:50% align:center
[ARTE groans]

00:08:53.199 --> 00:08:54.492 position:50% align:center
[LEO]
And your biggest mistake.

00:08:54.576 --> 00:08:55.702 position:50% align:center
You were too slow.

00:08:55.785 --> 00:08:56.995 position:50% align:center
[ARTE whines]

00:08:57.078 --> 00:08:58.705 position:50% align:center
[LEO] If the plaster
dries before it's painted,

00:08:58.788 --> 00:09:00.248 position:50% align:center
you have to start over.

00:09:00.331 --> 00:09:01.624 position:50% align:center
Capisce?

00:09:01.708 --> 00:09:04.252 position:50% align:center
[ARTE] So you're saying it's
bad and everything I did

00:09:04.336 --> 00:09:05.337 position:50% align:center
was completely wrong.

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:06.755 position:50% align:center
Basically, yes.

00:09:06.838 --> 00:09:09.966 position:50% align:center
But now, I know what
you need to improve on.

00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:11.051 position:50% align:center
What?

00:09:11.134 --> 00:09:12.594 position:50% align:center
[LEO]
All right, Arte.

00:09:12.677 --> 00:09:15.638 position:50% align:center
For the next ten days, I want
you to practice plastering.

00:09:15.722 --> 00:09:18.850 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Did you accept
a request for a fresco?

00:09:18.933 --> 00:09:21.144 position:50% align:center
No, not exactly.

00:09:21.227 --> 00:09:23.104 position:50% align:center
The guild has received
some complaints about me

00:09:23.188 --> 00:09:24.939 position:50% align:center
taking you on as an apprentice.

00:09:25.023 --> 00:09:26.358 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:09:26.441 --> 00:09:28.193 position:50% align:center
Your performance on this
project will determine whether

00:09:28.276 --> 00:09:30.153 position:50% align:center
you can continue your training.

00:09:33.823 --> 00:09:37.243 position:50% align:center
[ARTE sighs] Those ten days
flew by so quickly.

00:09:37.327 --> 00:09:39.245 position:50% align:center
Your task during this
project is to help with

00:09:39.329 --> 00:09:41.998 position:50% align:center
the decorative paintings
here in the grand hall.

00:09:42.082 --> 00:09:44.167 position:50% align:center
Behave as if everyone
here has their eyes on you

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:47.504 position:50% align:center
at all times,
judging your performance.

00:09:47.587 --> 00:09:49.714 position:50% align:center
I'm not going to treat you
any differently just because

00:09:49.798 --> 00:09:52.300 position:50% align:center
the guild council happens
to be watching today.

00:09:52.384 --> 00:09:55.053 position:50% align:center
You have your work
and I have mine.

00:09:55.136 --> 00:09:56.554 position:50% align:center
[ANGELO]
Ehi, Arte!

00:09:56.638 --> 00:09:58.264 position:50% align:center
I didn't know you'd be here!

00:09:58.348 --> 00:10:00.100 position:50% align:center
Ciao!

00:10:00.183 --> 00:10:01.976 position:50% align:center
It's good to see
a familiar face.

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:04.521 position:50% align:center
I'm glad we get to
work on the same project!

00:10:04.604 --> 00:10:07.065 position:50% align:center
Although. Don't look now,
but it's that guy.

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:09.818 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
It is that guy!

00:10:09.901 --> 00:10:13.113 position:50% align:center
[APPRENTICE 06C] Hmm? Ah!
What are you doing here?

00:10:13.196 --> 00:10:14.489 position:50% align:center
[clapping]

00:10:15.365 --> 00:10:17.534 position:50% align:center
[AROLDO]
Everyone. Attenzione!

00:10:17.617 --> 00:10:20.328 position:50% align:center
I'll be overseeing the
work in the grand hall.

00:10:20.412 --> 00:10:22.580 position:50% align:center
The reason I had you
all gather today was to give you

00:10:22.664 --> 00:10:24.833 position:50% align:center
a chance to meet
your fellow artisans.

00:10:24.916 --> 00:10:27.502 position:50% align:center
This is my worksite,
and I won't tolerate anyone

00:10:27.585 --> 00:10:29.087 position:50% align:center
causing trouble here.

00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:30.296 position:50% align:center
Tch!

00:10:33.967 --> 00:10:35.802 position:50% align:center
[MASTER ARTISAN 06B] Did you
hear the latest from Rome?

00:10:35.885 --> 00:10:37.721 position:50% align:center
[MASTER ARTISAN 06C] Yeah.
From the rumors I've heard,

00:10:37.804 --> 00:10:41.057 position:50% align:center
the pope has been investing a
lot into the arts over there.

00:10:41.141 --> 00:10:42.600 position:50% align:center
[MASTER ARTISAN 06B]
It's good for them, I suppose.

00:10:42.684 --> 00:10:45.020 position:50% align:center
But thanks to that, all the
work has been leaving Florence.

00:10:45.103 --> 00:10:46.521 position:50% align:center
We're barely scraping by.

00:10:46.604 --> 00:10:47.981 position:50% align:center
If this keeps up,
we won't be able

00:10:48.064 --> 00:10:49.858 position:50% align:center
to take care of the apprentices.

00:10:49.941 --> 00:10:52.193 position:50% align:center
And still Leo insists on
bringing in some girl

00:10:52.277 --> 00:10:54.237 position:50% align:center
instead of taking
in real artists.

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:56.197 position:50% align:center
[MASTER ARTISAN 06B chuckles]
Though, if you asked me,

00:10:56.281 --> 00:10:58.491 position:50% align:center
I'd rather be master-less than
train under some beggar

00:10:58.575 --> 00:10:59.743 position:50% align:center
from the streets.

00:10:59.826 --> 00:11:01.077 position:50% align:center
[MASTER ARTISAN 06C]
That's the truth.

00:11:01.161 --> 00:11:03.246 position:50% align:center
[MASTER ARTISANS laughing]

00:11:06.166 --> 00:11:08.001 position:50% align:center
Hello! It's nice to meet you!

00:11:08.084 --> 00:11:09.127 position:50% align:center
My name is...

00:11:11.379 --> 00:11:12.630 position:50% align:center
Uh, how are you today?

00:11:12.714 --> 00:11:15.508 position:50% align:center
My name's Arte, what's yours?

00:11:15.592 --> 00:11:17.344 position:50% align:center
Don't worry about them.

00:11:19.929 --> 00:11:21.598 position:50% align:center
Can I have your attention?

00:11:21.681 --> 00:11:24.434 position:50% align:center
I'm Arte, it's nice to meet you!

00:11:24.517 --> 00:11:27.062 position:50% align:center
I'm looking forward
to working with you all!

00:11:27.145 --> 00:11:28.605 position:50% align:center
Nice to meet you, too.

00:11:30.607 --> 00:11:32.942 position:50% align:center
[ARTE chuckles]

00:11:33.026 --> 00:11:35.236 position:50% align:center
Mm! This tastes amazing!

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:36.446 position:50% align:center
[LEO]
By the way.

00:11:36.529 --> 00:11:38.656 position:50% align:center
You handled yourself
really well back there.

00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:42.369 position:50% align:center
[ARTE] Hmm? Hmm...
Well. I'm used to all that.

00:11:42.452 --> 00:11:44.537 position:50% align:center
Being treated so rudely?

00:11:44.621 --> 00:11:47.207 position:50% align:center
Hmm...

00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:48.500 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:52.587 position:50% align:center
[LEO] Arte. There's something
I want to tell you about

00:11:52.671 --> 00:11:54.631 position:50% align:center
the work we have to do tomorrow.

00:11:54.714 --> 00:11:55.882 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
Hmm?

00:11:58.468 --> 00:12:00.595 position:50% align:center
[AROLDO]
Right, is everyone ready?

00:12:00.679 --> 00:12:03.098 position:50% align:center
You'll be working off
of these sketches.

00:12:03.181 --> 00:12:05.475 position:50% align:center
Each one of you has
their own assignment.

00:12:05.558 --> 00:12:07.686 position:50% align:center
Let me know if you
have any questions.

00:12:13.775 --> 00:12:16.403 position:50% align:center
[APPRENTICE 06E] I had forgotten
how tough fresco jobs were.

00:12:16.486 --> 00:12:17.946 position:50% align:center
[APPRENTICE 06F]
Yeah. Just carrying around

00:12:18.029 --> 00:12:20.115 position:50% align:center
the tools is exhausting.

00:12:20.198 --> 00:12:23.034 position:50% align:center
[LEO]
You idiot! What are you doing?

00:12:23.118 --> 00:12:26.121 position:50% align:center
It's all uneven!
This is completely unacceptable.

00:12:26.204 --> 00:12:27.622 position:50% align:center
Do it again!

00:12:27.706 --> 00:12:29.624 position:50% align:center
What was Leo
expecting from a girl?

00:12:29.708 --> 00:12:32.585 position:50% align:center
She's useless.

00:12:32.669 --> 00:12:34.254 position:50% align:center
Arte...

00:12:34.337 --> 00:12:35.755 position:50% align:center
[LEO]
Get that fresh water!

00:12:35.839 --> 00:12:37.048 position:50% align:center
And hurry it up!

00:12:38.466 --> 00:12:39.926 position:50% align:center
[ARTE groans]

00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:41.302 position:50% align:center
[LEO]
There's not enough paint!

00:12:41.386 --> 00:12:43.263 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
Sir!

00:12:43.346 --> 00:12:45.807 position:50% align:center
[APPRENTICE 06E] Leo's not
letting up on her at all.

00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:48.393 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure even
I could keep up with him.

00:12:52.897 --> 00:12:54.107 position:50% align:center
[ARTE grunts]

00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:56.109 position:50% align:center
Careful! Do you need some help?

00:12:57.485 --> 00:12:59.612 position:50% align:center
No, don't worry about me.

00:12:59.696 --> 00:13:02.407 position:50% align:center
This is my job,
and I have to do it myself!

00:13:06.745 --> 00:13:10.123 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
But. Thank you for your concern!

00:13:10.206 --> 00:13:11.958 position:50% align:center
I really appreciate it!

00:13:15.962 --> 00:13:17.213 position:50% align:center
Well...

00:13:18.673 --> 00:13:20.925 position:50% align:center
[ANGELO] She might manage
to impress the guild council.

00:13:21.009 --> 00:13:23.219 position:50% align:center
But at this rate,
she's gonna hurt herself.

00:13:27.182 --> 00:13:28.099 position:50% align:center

Are you all right?

00:13:40.987 --> 00:13:43.865 position:50% align:center
[ARTE]
Yes. I'm better now.

00:13:43.948 --> 00:13:46.368 position:50% align:center
I think I just needed
to rest a bit.

00:13:46.451 --> 00:13:47.786 position:50% align:center
I was worried
when I couldn't find you

00:13:47.869 --> 00:13:49.913 position:50% align:center
during the break, but I
didn't realize just how badly

00:13:49.996 --> 00:13:52.582 position:50% align:center
Leo's treatment
was affecting you.

00:13:52.665 --> 00:13:54.334 position:50% align:center
He's being unreasonable.

00:13:54.417 --> 00:13:57.337 position:50% align:center
Even a man would vomit after
such persistent heavy labor!

00:13:57.420 --> 00:13:59.798 position:50% align:center
It's too much!

00:13:59.881 --> 00:14:02.217 position:50% align:center
You should stay here
and rest, I'll go tell Leo.

00:14:03.468 --> 00:14:05.512 position:50% align:center

all that work on you.

Don't worry.

any excuse to remove you

00:14:21.319 --> 00:14:23.238 position:50% align:center
as my apprentice, Arte.

Ugh! Finally done!

to be just as hard.
